In Co-Production with Visions in Technology, D production and Czech Television Supported by the MEDIA program present a film by Jan Tomanek Our story is set in the Middle Ages during the reign of Charles IV. Prague was the main city in Europe. Some of the most amazing structures of the period were built here: The Stone Bridge across the Vitava, and the Old Town Astronomical Clock. - Doesn't look like a friendly place. - We'll see, Goat. - Get a move on. - You're trying to break the eggs. GOAT STORY THE OLD PRAGUE LEGENDS Listen, citizens of venerable Prague! Clock master Hanus is building the world's best Clock. It's a feast for the eyes... Prague is a magical place. In the daytime it is marvelous; at night magical and mysterious. - Fresh pumpkin... - People's destinies often cross here. Our heroes will soon find that out. The poor student Matthew, Jemmy, and Goat don't know that yet. Greetings, Student! Beautiful, Goat! Won't see anything like this back home. - Nothing but a big village. - Come on, Goat. Wait until we see Charles Bridge. Sty sweet sty! A real masterpiece! It was worth the trip. Here. We shall see. - They really add the eggs in mortar. - Next! Come on! You with the horned horse! Your turn. Now get out of here. You wait. Calling me a horse. Chicken doesn't harden mortar. Come chicks! Auntie doesn't bite. Superb bouquet. Pour it in. Eggs in mortar are eggs in mortar. There aren't this many people at the Sunday fair back home. This is something you only see once in a lifetime. Guys! No more blind men. - They work you to death here. - We're not in the sty, Goat! Wow! I'd like to do that, too. Go ahead, Jemmy. Show them your stuff. So you and the horned horse have come from the countryside to help. Come on, then! - I was thinking of sculptures... - We pay other people to think. Work won't wait. We have the most modern technology of the 14th century. Safe working conditions. The lowest mortality rate in Europe. He was working under the table. - And him? - Him, too! Move it! Let's get to work! Fly away! Come on, let's work! - Too much work! - You can say that, foreman! Let's hope Master Hanus completes our Clock on time. He knows the executioner is on stand-by. Quitting time! Oh, well... Sorry. My fault. I can't leave you alone for a second. Thank goodness our dearly departed mommy didn't live to see this. Goat! Stop! I don't have a license for gold coins. And what's more... We must all... keep in mind... that gluttony... is a mortal sin. It is the worst sin. Let's examine our consciences. Hell's flames burn unbearably. Amen! You shameless yobbo! Or don't buy a fat indulgence. - God said, "Amen!" - Amen. - I got offered another gold coin. - Hope you refused it. I'm no fool. My taxes would be unbearable. - Here they come. Get to work! - Sure. Money only brings trouble. Students! They never give. Goodnight, Matthew... Have fun! - Another one. - Young. Ambitious. It's as though he doesn't know what our clean... - and holy... - craft involves. That'll be a chicken... A goose... Now that's an indulgence. You can have a whole swine for that! No license, no begging. First do your apprenticeship. Now get out of here! Ragamuffin! What a life! Come here! What squirrel piss! Didn't even fill it all the way! Play! Low card deals! - You're broke, so scram! - What's this? -Horrible! Don't try that again! Prague is no place for people like you. Work never ends. Keep your distance, foreigner! Don't you know this is Faust's House? The devil lives here! Well, well. That's so beautiful! Come on, Jemmy. You could do that, too. Want to work with tools? Here! Quit dawdling, hack! - I always say gawking is an art. - True! You won't repair the sty at home, but you're just banging away here. Come on, Goat. This is different. Nail! - Where's my ladle? - Where's Karel? Nail... Nail! They're all gone! - Another nail, Goat! - We're out. See it's okay. - Fancy a nail? - Keep your head on. You're funny. See? Almost forgot. Another nail! Jemmy! Don't stare! Yeah, yeah. A nail. Got it. - Over here, Katy. We're waiting. - Thanks, Katy! Stop that! - Katy... - Right, Katy. Keep your head on! Nails with heads, shingling nails. Good grade, regular price, Katy. - Thank you, I'll be back tomorrow. - Katy... Katy... I know better names. Hop! The wonder of wonders to be unveiled in three days! An old bone. That's true bliss. I'd say so. But it belongs to me. - Put it here! - Let me go, stinker! Mine! Bitch! - Hello, Father! - Come in. So... - Daughter... - Here you are. Holy Virgin! Still warm. The finest quality. You won't even find relics like these at the Vatican. Authentic Christ's nails! Guaranteed to cure you. Gentlemen! - Quiet please, students. - I've heard enough! - concentration on the Clock's gears. -What do you want? The machine is driven by cogged wheels. - Gentlemen, please. - Look how stupid... I am begging you to quiet down. So... - let's look at... - Wheels and gears. You nerd! At least I have more time for carving. Goat! A nail! Nails. I'll give you nails! But this I won't help you with. A nail. I've only got two hands. Hand them to yourself! Jemmy! What's wrong? My lungs are burning! Lord in heaven! Who did this? Get her... Get in! - You've gained weight! - You're the one with a full udder! They're out of nails again. We will catch him eventually... - Straighten up! - After him! Goat! Whoa! End station. Get off the train. - We can hide here. - That was a close call. You have to keep your cool. This place is hopping. Like at home. Ladies, a team is a necessity. Be careful with the Clock plans. Hurry up! - Clock-master Hanus! - Hurry with the plans, dear Matthew! - Friends! - Cheers, poor boy! Hanus' pet! - Cheers, Goat! - Cheers! Down the hatch! - Slid right down. - He should be happy now. Careful, Goat! - Interference on the right! - Come on, play! - Play! Keep quiet! - I'm playing! -No, you're not! Look! - An eyeball! -Goat... - Showed them! -Enough! This isn't a Passion Play, vermin. - Praguers... - Quit mumbling. Here it comes! - Two more souls. Come to me, money! - No one'll stay in this smoke. They won't pay their bills in hell. - Will you marry me, Jemmy? - That won't work, Goat. Is it my looks? My age? - Of course not. - Of sourse not. I hate to interrupt, but how about paying up? Don't interrupt, in keeper. - We're not poor. - No lying... Lucky for you I have a soft spot for goats. I don't usually run tabs. What... Pay up! Closing time! - Let's do it! - Let's scram! My weakness has its limits. Don't come back, freeloaders! You forgot something! Next time clean up your droppings Another round, or are we leaving? Wow! Katy. - Hang on! Good fit. - She kicked the bucket. Ouch! What are you doing? We will have a magnificent Clock... in two days. Am I seeing things? A gold piece! You surely have a license. Have a look at them. That I will. I'll take this, lest it corrupt you. I wouldn't even dare a gold piece. Lowlife... My right horn hurts. I hurt all over. Wow! How pretty! Could it be me? Standard delivery. A hundred nails. Our expenses will fall. Thirteen times seven... Eighty-six. I don't worry about you, Matthew. It's the Clock. The Clock... Just two days left, and there isn't a single statue. - With luck we'll find a sculptor. - Who will Master Hanus choose? - Surely not you! - Pick me, master! - I'm educated. I've been abroad. - No... Not this, either. Oo la la... - On the contrary. - Finest French quality. Take that away. - No innovations. - Excuse me? I'll take that for kindling. Hello, Master! That's Clock-master Hanus. And they still don't have nails! - Now this! -Higher, Goat! - What's that I see? At last a talented sculptor. That makes me happy! I'd gladly share my opinion, but I wouldn't dare. Worthless humility. You're hired. From now on you work only on the Astronomical Clock. -How about the Apostles here? And a miser here? -Excellent. - A bather here. - Excellent! Lovely, but talk won't feed us. Oh, well. That'll be lovely soup. - Oh, my! -Damn! - We have guests. Nice ones. - I'll make something to eat. - No eyeballs, please. Low hand deals! I love you. Beer flows from you like on a rope. Sweet Marie! - Sit closer, Matthew! - We don't bite! - Here's your beer, gentlemen. - Keep the change. -Thank you. Buy us a drink, too. Once a pauper always a pauper, even if he eats caviar. Well said! Hanus' plans. And Matthew's pen. Wonderful. - You have a nice goat. - You think? She's no spring chicken. She's quite cheeky, too. - You're the cheeky one. - No, seriously. -What if I... She's quite spotted. Oops, that went by fast. Excuse me for a moment. Clever girl. Be right back. Peaches and cream. May your horns fall of - like we don't have the same wenches at home. - But she is from Prague, right. - Yes, Prague. Let's go! - Another beer for the gentleman. - On me. Real silver. Thank you. - Look at the pauper. - Loosened his purse strings. Still can't afford decent clothes. A silver coin isn't enough for that. - Worry not. You'll get there. - Just keep drawing. - Shall we begin? - Sure. Friends. - Don't let him see us. - Nice and quiet. Isn't Prague beautiful, Goat? I don't know. Be glad we have a roof over our heads. - And stop sulking. - Goodnight, Jemmy! Nighty night, Goat! Best to have it all on paper. Plans are fundamental. - A hundred bottles of beer... - Watch out! We have to be careful with Master Hanus' plans. Astronomical Clock to be unveiled... tomorrow! Isn't this beautiful, Goat? I always wanted to make statues. Don't bother me. I'm working. I must be seeing things. I have something for you, too. Cabbage. Here you are. What for? Am I a goat or something? Cabbage, where have you been? Thank you for looking after my plans, Matthew. My pleasure. - Goodbye. - Godspeed... Let's get it down on paper. What's this? - Well, I am truly... - Welcome, Aldermen. This is a great honor. Looks good. I'll have some. That's interesting. Look how interesting this is, Mr, Portreeve. Very interesting. Excuse me for poking you, Mr. Portreeve. One eye will do. - That's a perfect constellation. - That's Virgo constellation. How is our masterpiece coming? Rest assured, Mr. Portreeve. It will be ready tomorrow. - Do we know the inventor? - Certainly. But this... This wasn't part of our agreement. - Community funds won't pay for this. - What in the...? I only hope his work doesn't end up like his plans. The offender deserves the harshest punishment. Oh, God! Matthew. Master Hanus? Master Hanus! - You're under arrest! - There must be some mistake. I haven't done anything wrong. Matthew... What have you done? I'm so disappointed. I like you both, Goat, but in different ways. There's something missing. - You always call me Goat. - You are a goat. Here. That's it! A skeleton! How will I carve one by tomorrow, Goat? The stockade will teach you. He didn't pick up his toys, either. Alas, Matthew... Hanus... Why? What have I done? There. Now a ladder. We're finally going home! Perfect night for a trip. It'll be swell, just us two. Shush. Katy. More beer. You like it... One for the right hoof, one for the left. - More beer. On the double. - Don't knock yourself out. Swill like always. Weak. Watery. - Beer! - Cheers, friend! - Just one little signature. - Not me! Quite the hill. Grim. Which one? That one's small... too thin... that one's missing a leg... That one's the right size! Hurry home. You've been here long enough. Katy! Shush! Come on, buddy. There. Now you'll all see. I'll show you. We ended up having fun. Save your strength for tomorrow. - Goodnight, my talented sculptor. - Goodnight, Katy! I'll tell you a bedtime story. A bedtime story! What a great day. Prague is a lovely place... That dolly again. One day I'll show you. Jemmy, you wouldn't believe... Where did you get so pissed? Go to sleep. Let us first thank the city council, the portreeve, and God... for making this unique work possible, as well as other minor workers. Thanks to them this unique work, worthy of Prague, came to be. The Old Town Astronomical Clock. Bravo! Flower. Thanks. Enough already. I won't be a sucker anymore. The statues aren't that great. We could do that, too. That's something. Bravo! Beautiful. Let's go. Mine. Mine. All that for a Clock? I just use my blood sausage. That's what I get. If his mother hadn't begged me to watch over him, - I wouldn't be in this joint. -Milk! - All I do is take care of him. Keep drinking.. -Well... -At least the horned chap comes here. Nothing. - There. - The usual. - One alcoholic milk. - Thanks. - For me. -Bring me one. - Me, too. -Thanks. My... Who the...? Who the...? What the...? # $#$#%$*^#*%%^%#^* # - They say good eveninga. - Good evening. How may I help you? They say also want clock. Bigger. Roll out the barrel, and we'll have... Everything's spinning. I might fall on my... horn. There... and up. I drank too much again. Jemmy! Jemmy? What are you doing? No! Oops. Be right back, love. They ask she come with clock? Huh? Nice and quiet. What? Here we go! You, and you... Deviant girl. This could only happen in Prague. I feel sick. They say here deposit. You build clock. Many monies. Out of the question. He wants to show foreigners the plans for a pittance... and build an Astronomical Clock in a foreign land. We shall see who has the last laugh, Master Hanus! Yes. Certainly. I agree. An insult to the town hall. We'll make sure no other Astronomical Clock is built except in Prague. - Ever! - Yes! - Hello, Master Hanus. - Hello. Did you see how he carries himself? - Hello, Master Hanus. - Hello. Beautiful work, Master Hanus. Thank you, foreigner. I think we'll have to resolve this... Yes? Take care of this problem with loyalty to yourself... Master Mydlar. That I will. Another big job. If we do this on the other side... May I help... you? Master Hanus! My eyes! Take me to the Clock. Don't do it... There. What's going on? What have you done to me, Master Hanus? Why has the Clock stopped? After them! Get them! She did it. She did it! She's already in handcuffs! Murderer... The Prague grass is extra sweet today. What happened? - Come in, lad. - Have a seat. - Do you know how the Clock works? - No, I just... Didn't you help Hanus? - Jemmy... - Katy! - Yes, I did. I'll fix it. - I thought you'd be reasonable. You don't have much time. Otherwise we'll hang Katy. - You can't do that! - A little execution... Where do I start? How do I...? How does it fit? We're celebrating. Jemmy! Don't mope. Come on, you old billy goat. -Let's hit the town. -If only I knew... -Jemmy... - which wheel... - Aren't you ticklish? Thank goodness I have the plans. What is going on? Have they brought the nails finally? Goat! What have you done? Why must you eat everything? Did you pick your nose at the table, too? Oh, well. I can't fix it without the plans. Now I really did it. Goat! Hi, there! All out. The goat ran out of milk. May I join you, handsome? We'll have fun. You won't regret it. Oh, why not? It's only a goat. The contract. What's wrong? You'll never get away. I don't want riches! Take it all! You can't even find peace outdoors. - Handsome! - What size did you say you wore? I don't want riches! Take my money. Let me keep my soul! I have to at least try. If only there were more time. There. Small neck. Size six. At least we'll save on rope. Hang on, Katy! I'm coming. Not so fast, young man, you have work to do. I have to do it. I can do it! Katy? Katy! Jemmy! Forgive me. You didn't do anything wrong, Goat. It's not your fault. Look, Hair Ball! Fun awaits. It's time. - She's a witch! - Stone her! Hang her! Murderer! Death... Katy... Take that, murderer! Was that right, Daddy? I didn't mean to... No! I don't want money! Give me back my soul! I don't want money any more! What do you want, Devil? Leave me alone! We'll put you here. Is that you, Goat? Katy, Katy... What have I done? Catch her! Stop her! That's it. Keep going. Execution souvenirs fix character defects! Get your ropes here! Execution souvenirs for the whole family! Lucky rope for sale soon! Well that's the... I'm done for. The Clock isn't working yet. We won't wait any longer. So let us begin. Bring forth the criminal. I can't even fix the Clock. This reprehensible act calls for the harshest punishment. Death by hanging. Am I right? Excellent. Hanging... What if I put it here? It works! It works! I did it! The Clock works! Where is everybody? No, no... Hangman, carry out your orders. Hang her... Oh, God! No! I still have lots of time. Katy! - The axe is more interesting. - Rope is rope. Executioner's apples! Great flavor! Despite the circumstances, the Portreeve, with God's help, has repaired the Clock himself! The only thing I ask is that you return my Katy to me. I have always been humble. I only want Katy. Katy? Katy! Jemmy... She always had a good head on her shoulders. I'm so sorry, Jemmy. - Goat! - Goat... Think I need this at my age? - Goat... - Goat! I knew you could hang! And a sunset, no less. Unbelievable. - The goat is heavy. - As heavy as a cow.
