- What are you doing, Derek? - I'm not doing anything. Um. Hi. Yeah. It's me again. Yeah, false alarm. Password? What's our password? - Saponification. - Sapon? Our password? - S-A-P, yes. - S-A-P-O, okay. Thank you. Our password is saponification? Ooh. - Oh. - Well? - Have you tried these? I'm pretty sure this is what birds use to make their nests out of. - Derek. - Grandma, when was the last time you had some cereal with some sugar in it? - You know that I did not know that you left last night. - I just went to a board game meetup. Wanted to meet some people, rap a little. - I just thought, you know, he needs his space, so I'll rent a movie. And he'll come down if he wants to come down. - I did come down, though. I-I-I... - Mmm-mmm. - Hey, I'm sorry. I should've said something. - It's okay. - So, what movie did you rent? - The one we should've watched together. - Okay. Uh, did you finish it? - I did. And it was very entertaining. I laughed. - Well, here's this. What we will do, okay? Tomorrow, me and you will watch it together, and we'll both laugh, okay? How's that? - Somethin's ready. - Oh, here we go. - Huh. - So you were really upset with me, huh? - Oh, no. - It's okay. You can still use 'em. - Yeah, but I can't sell them. - Sorry I set off the alarm. - You know, I will play board games with you. You don't need a group for that. - It's just sometimes I want to, uh, hang out with people my age, you know? Meet other people, you know? - No, I get it. - You're still my best friend, though. Huh. So you's not gonna say it back, huh? Huh? Cool. Look, here's what you do, okay? Call them anti-valentines. Yeah? Sell them to people fresh out of a heartbreak. Goodnight, Grandma. - Goodnight, best friend. - You just need, need, need, and I can't give all the time. I was an only child, Kenny. - Is it too much to show me that you care? Three words. Three words. I love you. Two words. Thank you. Four words. - Oh, I've got four words for you. I mean, how about shut the fu- - See? See? See? See what I'm talkin' about, Pastor? See what I'm dealin' with? Her mother tells me that she loves me more than my own wife. - Okay, then why don't you just marry her? - Unfortunately, she's taken. - See, that right there? That's what I'm talking about. I can never tell when he's joking. - Wasn't a joke. - Well, I can understand why- - See, okay, Pastor gets it. He understands me. - Hold on. - Now seriously, Pastor? You're gonna do that to a brother? - Look, you all need to go back to your why. - Your why? - Our what? - Yeah, what was it that made you fall in love and marry in the first place? - Pastor, people change. - What? - When I first met you, you were charming and enthusiastic about us. And now it's just like I'm talkin' to a brick wall. - A brick wall. Oh. Wow. - How does love survive when the spark that drew me to him constantly changes? - You said you married me because I listened. - I think what we need to do is go on into the sanctuary. We'll finish up in a minute. - All right, I'll get ya. - Oh, okay, we're done with today? Awesome. Wonderful. Great. Really, really effective. - No, no, come on. Just, uh, give me a second. Come on. Come on. - Counseling session's over. - My wife and I, we were married for 25 years. 25 years, now that's commitment. - Pastor Patrick. Is this a new suit? Looking good. - Now imagine if every relationship were contingent upon feeling loved every day. There would be a lot of lonely people. - Yeah, Pastor, I don't mean to be rude, but. I know that your wife passed away five years ago, but if relationships were so great, then why aren't you in one? Because it's been a minute. - 2,628,000 minutes, give or take. - What, you think I majored in church secretary? - You just, you kept up with those? Hold on. - Oh, you should set him up with your friend. - Which friend? - Briella. - Oh, Briella. - Yeah. - Mmm-hmm. - Yeah. I'll get you her number. - Wait, why do you have her number? Why do you have her number? - Because we're friends. - No, I'm friends. - Guys, can we just move on? - Look, Pastor. You're gonna like this one. She's very well favored. What? I was gonna say well favored. Of the Lord. She won't get you that number. - Kenny, I really don't need the number. - Love is heavy in the air on this fine Sunday morning. Amen? - Amen. - Can I get an amen? - Amen. - Can you just feel it? - Yes. - All right. So let us stand to our feet and praise the Lord. - Elise, just get it out. Whatever tension you're holding onto right now is absorbing into my skin and throwing my breathing all out of whack. - What are you talking about? - Emotional osmosis. - Emotional osmosis? Oh, please. - Don't get all judgey with me. Emotional osmosis is a real thing. - Perhaps it's your own tension that your osmoting. - I wasn't tense until I started breathing next to you. What is wrong with you today? - Nothing. Now, can we just please relax, okay? - Okay. - Breathe. Let it out. Again. - No, I feel something is up. What is it? Your shop? - Moxie is fine. - You met a man. Don't tell me you finally let a man into that closed off heart of yours. No, couldn't be that. Hell hasn't frozen over yet. - Look, I am good. I am settled. I am busy. Between the shop and little Derek, my cup is overflowing. - Little Derek? How old is he now? - He's 19. You were at his birthday party. - Yeah, I was. Where were you? That's no little Derek. He's handsome young man Derek, and you've been using him as an excuse for 19 years. - Look, I promised my son that I would be there to care for him. - Honey, what are you gonna do when he leaves? - When he leaves? - They all do eventually. - Oh. Derek needs me. - You're all he's known his whole life, but he needs a life beyond you. - Uh, I'm sorry. Just slow your breathing down. You're making me hyperventilate. Oh, this isn't working. All right, time for a little retail therapy. - Well, you know when Derek makes up his mind, he's free to do what he wants to do. - Hmm, how's that workin' out? - He's a different kind of kid, but he's happy. - Oh, yeah? Did he tell you that? Look. No thanks. We've known each other a long time, right? - A long time that years of therapy can't erase. - Oh! All right, then you'll agree that that gives me the right to call it like I see it. - I am not charging you for the meditation room. - Well, you're not gonna like this, and I don't wanna go there. - Well, don't go there! - But I am going there. When was the last time you had a man, Elise? - What? - Watch the tension. - Oh, you know what? That's gonna be $34 and 50 cents. - I thought you weren't charging me for the meditation room. - Oh, but the tension makes me say things I don't really mean. - You know, if you don't start living a life outside of Derek, he's never gonna have the confidence to do what he was created to do. I know why you gave up on love. But me? I'm done hiding. I'm getting out there. - And you're also getting up there. - Sure, we're not 20 anymore, but there's still life to be lived. You know what? My singles group is having an ice cream social tonight. It'll be fun. I'll even pick you up. Come on. Stealth Smooth, baby. - Goodbye, Pam. - Do it for Derek! - Thanks for shopping at Moxie's. - Stealth Smooth, baby. When you least expect it, pew! Expect it! Ha ha! - Oh, Pam. - Uh. June, I'm not, June, I'm not seeing this place. - Did you try calling? - Went straight to voicemail. You sure this place is still around? - Well, they catered my husband's wake. - June, your husband is still alive. - That was my other husband. You didn't know him. - Excuse me. - Really, Pam? - I'm looking for, uh- - Mmm-hmm, go on. - Well, there was a caterer. GPS still has it listed. - Uh-huh. - Garden Cafe. Do you know anything? - Oh, I know it. I know it all. - Can you tell me where they moved? - I could. - Tell you what. I'll just figure it out myself. - Is that the best you have, Stealth Smooth? - Uh, sorry. Uh, actually, I'd like to do a little shopping. Uh, let me see. - Okay. - Uh, what are these? What are these? - Those are essential oils. Patchouli, sandalwood, oregano, like that. - I'll take 'em, I'll take 'em, I'll take 'em. And, and this. - Oh, soap, organic. Handmade with love. - I'll, I'll take it. Yeah. - Okay, okay now, mister. Look, I don't know where she found you, but this isn't funny anymore. Now where is she? - What are you doin'? - Pam! Pam! I've told you before that I love my life! I don't need a man! I love my life! I love my life! - Uh, can you shut the door? Uh, please, shut, shut the door. - So, Pam didn't send you? - Who's Pam? - Oh my goodness. Oh, my mistake. I am, I am so sorry. - I'll get out of your way. - Oh, oh, what about all these? - Is, uh, is $20 good? - Uh, it's closer to 85. - $85 for soap? - The oils. That patchouli. - Here's a 100. I'll take the basket. - Again, I'm sorry. Well, goodbye to you, too. That's all I've got so far. - The board game meetup? You couldn't come up with a better excuse? - Look, she believed it, so it worked. That's all I needed, okay? But how about we check out my latest masterpiece? What is that? Did something just move? Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Ah! Where'd the door go? Where'd the door go? All right. So? - I just. I mean, do you want me to give it to you straight? - Guess not. Um, lie to me. - Um, yeah, so that was hilarious. You know I like you, okay? So don't take this the wrong way. But maybe you should find a real board game meetup and start going. - Okay, you know what? That's just rude. Look, then you got people like this guy. - Hey, everybody. Check out my latest video. It's the cat's meow. - He's making a million a year off of his channel. He doesn't even have a life, and I get not having a life, okay? But he's not even funny about it. - Dude, your early stuff was great, okay? You know, you interacted for your audience and that's how we met. - You're the only commenter. It wasn't that hard. - Well, then you just gotta build your audience. - I'm trying to. I'm trying to be different. - Oh, you're already different. That's half the battle already won. - If that was supposed to be a compliment, you should work on that. - Stop overthinking, okay? You know, I haven't even met you and I'm already your number one fan. - Some number one fan. Haven't even let me see you. - I told you. My camera's busted, okay? Savin' up for a new one. - You know, if you, uh, hang out here we could hang out 24/7. - Well, maybe you should come out here. - Where is out here? Just to be clear. Uh, East Coast? West Coast? - Mmm, not too far. - You're playing games. Look, I just, I need a reason to leave that doesn't hurt her feelings or my wallet. I don't know, maybe then I wouldn't feel as bad. - Your grandma? - She doesn't have anyone else. - Well, you never know. Maybe she likes it better that way. - Trust me. She had an entourage, okay? She was a super star. I've seen so many fan theories online, just articles talking about where did she go? You know, why did the band split up? Are they ever gonna get back together? You have no clue how much I wanna say something. - Maybe you should. That actually would be really dope. You could do like a vlog or something. - The lady won't even let me put her on social media under a fake name. You think she's gonna get in front of my camera? - Well, I don't know. Do you know the story? - No. I am the story. She, uh. Chose me over her own success. Yeah, I'm never getting outta here. - Well, since you're stuck where you are for now, uh, do you want to help me run lines for my play? - Considering you got that one last time, I don't think I want to. - Okay, there is nothing wrong with last time. - There was a couple of things wrong last time, i.e. you continuously making me play the girl. - And what's wrong with that? - I don't know. It's, it's like she's everywhere. I can't leave the house without feeling her presence lingering over me. She's in my thoughts, things I say. I really think I'm going crazy. Okay, this play sucks. Clearly he killed her. What's the mystery? - It's not that bad, okay? - Yeah, he killed her, but he didn't know that she was actually dead. Okay, yeah, no. It's bad. - Really bad. - Really bad. - That's pretty. Hey! Um, have you seen my grandma, 'cause there ain't no way that you her. - Listen, I want you to wrap this up. Put it in the refrigerator when you're done. - You going somewhere? - I might be late, so. - So I'm just supposed to stay home all night by myself? - Well, that's up to you. Look, I could cancel. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it's cool. It's cool, totally. Go ahead. Go do whatever it is you gotta go do. - Okay, well. You put the alarm system on. I know the code. - For sure. Have fun! Not too much, though. - Elise! Oh, you made it! Oh, you look beautiful! - You do, too. You look beautiful. - Welcome, ladies. Oh, you're in for a treat tonight. I need you to fill this out, and then take a number, and then you can join the other daters. Oh, and don't forget this. You can keep score. - Ice cream social. - It'll be fun. And you can go ahead and get your ice cream on the way home. Eh, it's just like the old days. All these people just waiting to meet us. That's your seat right there. - I told you that I wanted to take it easy my first time out. - Well, speed dating is the best way to break you back in. Just pretend this is a job interview, and if you don't like them, you don't gotta hire 'em. It'll be fun. - Ah. - Full house. - Good. Maybe we should have speed dating on Sunday mornings and boost our attendance. - So, are you gonna hide in here all night long? - I was trying to. - Kenny, what are you doing here? You're not single. - Well, I will be if you don't find a way to fix us. All right, chill. I'm here to set the mood for you. And you've been out of the game for a long time, right? And someone needs to make sure you don't say something stupid. - Look, Kenny, I'm not participating. - What? - Hey, we're short on men. Oh, come on. You don't want tonight to be a total washout. I suggest you step in and be a body. Hello? Hello? Hello. Greetings, everybody! Welcome to singles night! - Uh, I thought this was bingo. - No. Next Thursday, Sam. - Right, uh. - Oh my gosh. - I'm gonna stay. - Well, bless your heart. Take a seat. Okay, let me repeat. This is speed dating, and there are rules. Gentlemen, when you hear the bell, take a seat. You have one minute with your date. And then when you hear the bell again, move to the next seat. Oh, this is gonna be fun! Is everybody ready? - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Gina. - Patrick. - Kenny. - Oh! So is this a two-for-one deal? - Oh, no, no. I'm married. I'm strictly here for this guy. - Aw, how sweet. What a good friend. - I know. - Is he, is he special? - This guy? Oh, he's super special. - I could tell. He reminds me of my uncle. He was special, too. Don't give up. No matter what anyone ever tells you. You are necessary. Important. You matter. - Hi, how are you? - What do you do for a living? - I'm the pastor. - It's a two-fer! - What do you do for a living? - I'm the pastor. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Uh, yeah, yeah. - Man, that was like turnin' on the heat for the first time since summer. Always stinks before it gets warm. Have a seat, bro. - Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Just lighten up. All right? - Got it. - Hi. And your name? - Hey. - Nice to meet you, Karen. I'm Kenny. - I'm a pastor. - Really? - What are your superpowers exactly? - Aw, this? Of course it's real. - It's a knockoff. - Bruh. - Pyrite. - Uh, so how are you both doing? - Excuse me. I'm sorry. I didn't realize anybody was out here. - You're the guy that wrecked my shop. - And you're the crazy lady that said somebody named Pam sent me. - Haven't you ever had a bad day before? - Yes, I have. - And you thought that I was? I was just looking for directions. - And then you leave my space with almost everything in the store. - Oh, well the patchouli is nice. - Uh, let me see that. - This isn't patchouli. This is neem oil. We use it on dogs to repel fleas and ticks. - Oh. It's a beautiful night. - It is. - Thank you for redeeming the night. - Oh! I hadn't been to church in a long time, and I had a nice time. - Yeah, you know, maybe we should, uh- - Uh, yes. - Do this again. - Yes, yes, and it would keep our friends off our backs, right? - Right, right, right. How about Friday night? Do you have a number? - You can reach me at Moxie's. - Great. I'll call you. - You're up a 1000 followers after one video. - Right? - You're not gonna get in trouble for this, are you? - I don't know. Maybe, once she sees how much people still miss her. I don't know. Might just boost her up a bit. - All right, I support it. So what are you gonna do for your next one? - What do you mean? - Well, the '80s are trending and she's a superstar from that era. You've got momentum, okay? You've gotta keep pushing content. And I really think you have something here. - We're up another 20 followers since we started talking. - You, my friend, are going to be making money off this in no time. - What? Kenny? - She kicked me out. - Theresa? - That'd be the one. Excuse me. Can I get through? Little help here? - So it's a date? - It is not a date. - It sounds like a date. - It's just two people who have something in common. Both have pushy, meddling friends who think they know what's best for their lives. - Okay, well, where you goin'? - We are going to dinner and a movie. - Are you trying to get me to believe that doesn't sound like a date to you? - It is not a date. - Eh. Is this what you're wearing for your not a date? - Well, I'm leaning toward this one. - Hmm. - Or this here. - Grandma. - Yes? - No, no, no, it screams grandma, audibly. Very loud, in fact. Mmm. Where did you even get this? How did I let you get away with this? - What? No, no, no, no. I understand. Yes, Theresa. But we can't always... He said what? Oh, no. No, I did not encourage him to attend speed dating. But I assure you, he was with me the entire time. Right. Huh? He said what? I agree. I agree. No, but he can't stay here. Eh. Hello? Hello? Well, I can't believe this. She just hung up the phone on me. Um, she kicked ya out. - I told you. - Well, you got another woman's number at speed dating. - No, I got the number for you! Like I need another woman. I can't even handle the woman I got! - Well. You can't stay here. - It's a conspiracy, Pastor. Theresa was just waitin' to pin something on me. - You can't stay here. - Where am I supposed to go? - You'll figure it out. - It's okay. I'll just, uh, make a few calls. God. Always on time, right? Unbelievable. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. - You found somethin'? - The verse of the day. "When I was hungry, you fed me. When I was thirsty, you gave me drink. When I was a stranger in the land, you took me in. When I was naked, you clothed me." - You can have the weekend. - Putting a lot of faith in Theresa taking me back, don't you think? - Oh, I'm putting my faith in you, Kenny. - In me? - In you to fix your marriage and convince your wife to welcome you back into her open, loving arms. - Yeah, I don't remember the last time my grandma went on a date, but I'm pretty sure that whoever was the president at the time is probably dead. Oh! Okay, this is perfect for your date not date. All right, where you meeting him? - Ah, he's picking me up. - Oh! - It's a date. - It's a date, yeah. - Oh, you know what? I'm gonna call him and cancel. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is yours. Um, it's fine. Don't you like this guy? - It, it, it, it, let me see. Here it is. You were absolutely right. I, I, I don't need to be doing this. - Uh, nobody said that, first of all. Secondly, listen. Me and you, I think we, we could use our own space for a little bit, you know? I've been getting under your nerves and you've definitely been, well, listen. Oh, it's him, it's him. It's him, it's him. - Okay, answer it, answer it, answer it. - Hi. Hello, Pastor. - Pastor? - Uh-huh. Yes. I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. And you? - I, um. Something came up. One of my parishioners. - You're the only one who can help me. - I, I understand. Yes, yes, yes, yeah. Mmm. All right. Okay. Maybe some other time. All right. Buh-bye. - Uh. Wait, what happened? - I guess that he realized that it was a date, too. Pizza? - Yeah, pizza. Hmm. - It's the bottom of the eighth inning- - She never lets me use the remote. - Two outs with a runner on first base. Now the big guy comes up to bat. - My man. My favorite show. You like this one? - You should've seen her face. She was so sad. - Uh, yeah, I did, along with the rest of your followers. - You know I had a couple of guys actually reach out and offer to take her on a date? - That's creepy. - Yeah, little bit, yeah. But my point is, this could be bigger than we ever imagined, you know? We could like, we could make a whole show out of this maybe. You know, date my grandma? Yeah? - Hey, Derek, um, sorry. Can we actually talk about this later? - Yeah, sure. Okay. - Sorry, um, I'm just meeting up with a friend and we were gonna run some lines, so. - Oh, so you're firing me as your scene partner. - No. No, it's just, it's this guy from school that I've had a crush on since like 6th grade. We ran into each other the other night and he's into theater, so, you know. Hello? You still there? - Yeah. Where else would I be? - Excuse me. Can you help me? I'm a bit lost. - Let me guess. You're out of patchouli. - I wanted to apologize. - For what? - Didn't want you to think that I stood you up. - It wasn't a date. - Right, not a date. So. Are you free? - Now? - Sure. Lunch? Everybody's gotta eat. - Sure. Just let me finish with my customers. - I'll be happy to wait. Third generation ministry. It just runs in the family. It's me, my father, my father's father. - So I guess there was no question that you would follow into their footsteps. - True. Should we say grace? - Uh, of course, yes. Uh, it's been awhile, I admit, and it's been a challenge. - Well, we don't have to. - Oh, no, no. Let's do it. I've got this. Heavenly Father, thank you. Thank you for our health, thank you for this food, and thank you for this new friendship. - Amen. - So, what, uh, attracted you to the soup? I mean, to soap? - Oh, well, this is my second career, and I take comfort in creating something pure, you know? Something with purpose. - There's definitely a purpose in being clean. - Mmm. - What did you do before? - Um, that's a long time ago. Why don't I give you a hand with this. - Okay. - See, what we're gonna do is that you just hold it there and that- - Oh, one handed. - That finger helps, okay? So you just try it since you're a lefty. Grasp it. Good, good, good, good, good. Yeah. - Mmm-hmm. Mmm. But uh, you teachin' me how to eat. Must have kids. - I did. A son. Thomas. And he was, he was a troublemaker. Whoa to anyone who said no or got in his way. - So he takes after you? - Took after me. He was a Marine. I encouraged it. He needed structure, and I didn't afford that. So, um, right before he was shipped out, he met a beautiful girl, charming, and he got her pregnant. And then a little while after that, he was deployed to Afghanistan where he was out on patrol and he stepped on a landmine. - I'm so sorry. - And I am still wrestling with God over it. - Well, I've been known to have a shouting match or two with him myself. - Oh, I do more than shout. I just shut down. - Five years ago, I lost my wife to ovarian cancer. - Mmm. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. - She was my world. I was lost without her. - Yes. - I withdrew. Was sad, mad, lonely. - Yes. - But, but faith, my faith was my comfort. In time I went back to work and got better. What about you? - I just threw myself into raising my grandson. His mother was young. She had all of these wild ideas, and she just wasn't up to it. So I took him and I raised him. Derek. His name is Derek. And he is amazing. And not just because he's my grandson, either. He just is. And it's like I still have a little piece of my son Thomas with me. - Your husband wasn't in the picture? - Sometimes it is a good thing when God doesn't answer your prayers. - Oh. I have to say that that was a nice diversion. Thank you. - I enjoyed it, too. - You have kind eyes. Oh, um. For practice. - Does this mean we get to do this again? - Thank you, Pastor. - Thank you. Is that a yes? - Yes! - I really don't know what I'm doin'. - Uh, Pastor. - Uh, yeah. Oh, um. Yeah, why do you think I had you all take a look at that? - Uh, to make us feel guilty? - Do you have something to feel guilty about? - No, baby. - Years ago when I first started counseling you, you made lists of what drew you to one another. I want you to go back to your beginning. Maybe you'll start to appreciate the things that life and years of marriage have caused you to take for granted. - Yeah, but a lot can happen in a marriage, Pastor. - Oh, yeah. - It's why we've been drifting apart. - Well, good. What I want you to do, I want you to make a new list. What are you grateful for right here, right now? Ooh. Oh, um, I'll be right back. No, no, you did not interrupt anything. Yeah, yeah. I was thinking about you too, Elise. Yeah. - Yes! - Stop it. - Yeah. - Hey, all. I'm about to take y'all into the kitchen, where my grandma brought the pastor home. Okay, that sounds really weird. Basically, she invited him over for dinner, and now they're on dessert. - I mean, what do you mean you've never heard this song before? - No, the only music my father allowed in our house was gospel music, and not even the gospel greats. It was choir music. This one time I brought home an Al Green album. - Uh, I loved him. - Yeah. Well, my father smashed the album. - No! - Yeah, traumatized me. From that point on, I missed out on anyone who was anyone in the music world. - Well, you know what? You may have not missed out on much. - Agree to disagree, Grandma. Um, Pastor, you probably didn't know, my grandma used to be in a group. - You were in a band? Like- - Not just in a band. The lead of the band, all right? Weren't you, Grandma? - Derek, don't you have some homework to do? - No, actually I don't. You know I'm not in school no more. Good try, though. - Well, who was the name of the group? I may have to remedy my past. Or is this something we don't discuss in the house? - Not anymore. Well, we used to. Honestly, I don't know why we stopped. She was- - The name of the band was Sugar & Spice. - Were you the spice? - Depends on the day. - And what kind of music did you do? - We just sang, but not that you would know, choir boy. - Ooh! Okay, well, school me then. - Uh, show him some pictures, Grandma. - I will not. - Well, I can just look you up when I get home. Actually, I can just- - Don't you dare. - Ooh! That jacket! - Oh, yeah, that's the one she got in the closet right now. - Oh, now what song should I pick first? - You know what? I think we should show him the video. Don't you, Grandma? - I vote video. - I also vote. I like him. - No, no, let's leave the '80s behind. - Come on, Grandma. - Absolutely not. - Can you still do that? - Uh, did you just touch your head on the ground? - Grandma, come on. Come on, dance with me. - No, no, no, no, no. - Come on. Hang on. - Around. Okay. So what was the move? You gotta show me. - Oh, don't forget the dip. - Oh, yeah. Okay, okay, okay. - Okay. - Okay, then backwards. - Backwards? - Yeah. - Okay, go, go. - Come on, come one, come on! - Oh, no, no. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay, all right, all right. - Come on over, come on over. Hold on. - Okay. - You got it. - Okay. - Easy, okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Dip on sugar. - Okay. - Okay. - Sugar? - Yeah, uh-huh, okay. - One, two. - Yeah. - Yeah. - You gotta count, okay? - Hey. - Help your friend. - Okay, okay, okay. - Oh, oh, oh! - Okay, okay, okay. - Uh-huh. - That's a catchy beat. - I can't even. - I love it. - Why? - You're fun. - No, I'm not that fun. - Feel like, I don't know. This is good. - Yeah. It is good. - This is quite a surprise. - Y'all. I think my grandma just got her first real kiss in an extremely long time. Okay, Pastor. - Oh. - Havin' fun? - Not anymore. - Hmm. Who is she? Are you in love? I know that look. You had the same one with my sister. - Well, Angie's been gone for five years. - And that's Angie's fault? - Well, she wanted me to move on whenever I was ready. - So who is she? And she sleepin' here, too? - Honey, I'm home! Oh. - Patrick, what are you into? - You are the last person to tell me how to live my life. You did it when Angie was alive, but I am under no obligation to do it now. - Really? - Not this time, Nadine. - No one can replace her. - I'm not trying to replace her. I'm just trying to move on with my life as best I can. I need you to leave. Goodnight. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Huh? Yeah, no, I actually can't right now. Why? Because, let me tell you. Grandma forgot that we had this giant order of, one second, I've got it right here. Lavender-infused coconut cold-pressed oiled soap or whatever. I don't know. Was supposed to go out to some California wellness event weeks ago, though. - Grandma? Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! - What? What? What? - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Nothing. I got it. Hey. Yeah. No, no, false alarm. Yeah, uh, my grandma. Yes, actually, again. Um. Password. Oh. Desertion. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Thank you. - And when did you change our safe word? Uh! Oh-ho-ho. Oh, thank you. The soap for my California event, oh. - You know, I put a little bit of lemongrass oil in there, too. - Ooh, you are my best friend, ever. I love you, baby. - I love you, too, Grandma. - Thank you. - Hey, should I? - No, no, no, no. Just let it go to voicemail. - Okay. Um, who is it, anyway? Oh. - And he's called twice. And he won't leave a message. I don't even know how he got my number. - Um. Yeah. That's weird. Are you gonna call him back? - Absolutely not. No way. You know, outside of you and your father, that's a chapter that never should've been written. - Yeah, you, you should block him. - I don't know how. - I got it. Okay, there you go. Yeah, he shouldn't be able to reach you. - Oh, thank you. - Mmm-hmm. - Yes, you are amazing. Oh, you are the best! - Oof. - Are you okay over there? - Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Are you serious? I'm paying for this room, you know? - Sorry. - Ugh! - What is wrong with you? You are throwing my osmosis all out of whack. - That's not even how it works. Who introduced you to this guy in the first place, huh? - He did, when he walked into my shop. - Uh, no. I took you to his church. I just got you back, and now you leave me all over again. - I didn't leave you. - You left the band. That's leaving me. What if he breaks your heart just like Jeff did, huh? Oh, you're gonna need me then. - Oh, don't even go there. - Whatever. - Look, okay, okay. Excuse me. Now who told me that I needed to get a life? In this very room. Huh? Can I not do anything right in your eyes, Pamela? - I just want the old Elise back. Oh, not the uptight shop owner, but the non-stop fun Elise. I don't know where she ran off to. - Maybe she's gone off in another direction. - I was always the more dynamic and attractive one, and now I'm stuck. I don't know what to do with my life. I mean, I'm funny, right? I mean, I could be a comedian, do standup. - Oh, yes. You are making me laugh. The most attractive one. Pam. Your strong suit is your smooth sailing through any situation. Use it. That is why we called you Stealth Smooth Baby. - All this time I thought it was because of my long, long, supermodel legs. Walk, walk, work that runway, work that runway. - That is funny! That is funny, girl! - Oh my goodness. Well, thank you, folks. I'm here all week. - You. All right, Smooth. It's me and you tomorrow. - I can't wait. - Mmm. I love you, baby. - I love you more. - Mmm. All righty, righty. Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you coming. - No, you sure didn't. Moxie, interesting name. - Oh, thank you. So, how can I help you? - Oh, I'm just checking it all out. - Yes, now those are my favorite. Lemongrass and calendula. - Mmm. Oh, and while I'm here, do you have anything for men? Something a little more natural, spicy, manly kind of scent. - I do. Happens to be right here. - Mmm, yes. I think that'll work. - Wonderful. All righty. Ah, knowing Patrick, he'll probably steal that, too. - Patrick? - My boyfriend. He's a pastor here in town. - Oh. Patrick at Cornerstone? - You know him? - So you two are? - Going on four years. I'm certain he's gonna love these. Oh, you have a great rest of your day. - Come on. Pick up. Hey. Hey, it's, uh, it's been awhile. - Yeah. Yeah, I've been pretty busy. - Tried you like five times. I'm not always on my computer. - Yeah. Look, I have a problem. - Yeah? - You've been watching my videos, right? - Yeah. - Okay, so, I don't know where my grandpa reached out to my grandma, and he hasn't been around since I was a baby, so it was kind of bizarre. You're still there, right? - Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I'm still here. - Yeah, um. She keeps her information private for a reason, so I don't know how he got her number. - Are you serious? - He must've, he must've found my channel. Do you think he's gonna tell her? - Don't know. - What does that even mean? Look, you usually have really good advice, and I could use some of that right now. - I'll think about it. - But- - I said I'll think about it, okay? I gotta go. - What? - Hey, Elise. It's Patrick again. Just wanted to leave you another message. I've left several texts. Uh, call me. Look forward to getting together again. - Hello, dear brother-in-law. I come in peace. - It's not a good time, Nadine. - We're family. You can't give me a few minutes? - You can't keep doing this. Can't keep popping in and out of nowhere, following me, watching me. - No, no, I prefer to think of them as wellness checks. I'm doing this for my sister. - Are you? - It wasn't always bad between you and me. She was more a mother to me than my mother ever was. - I know she loved you. - Maybe I was too involved. - Was? - I wanna show you something. You are the only living thing that connects me to her. - I miss her everyday. But she is still alive in my heart. Maybe you should find some peace, too. - If only I could. Patrick, I've done some bad things, some things I shouldn't of. - Through God's grace we are forgiven, and our hearts renewed. - You forgive me? After all I've done? - You have so much energy. I mean, laser-focused energy. Maybe you should use your gifts to serve others and reclaim your life. - You made my sister very happy. That's all I need to remember. - You tell her that we can't give her more than that. She's a brand-new artist. She knows she has no leverage. You know what? Hold on. I got a call coming on the other line. Hello? - Uh, Jeff? - Elise? You finally unblocked my number. - Is this a bad time? - No, no. I, uh, how are you? - Ah, you're probably busy. I probably never should've called. - I always have time for you, Elise. We got a lot of catching up to do. - Listen, I'm in New York right now, but I'm headin' your way soon. I'd love to see you if you're available. - I don't know. - Come on, it would be like old times. - And that's supposed to be reassuring? - Of course it is. We had some good times, didn't we? Hmm? I'm gonna call you, but you're gonna have to unblock my number. - Um, I'll be in touch. Thank you. - Hello, you. - Jeff. - I was at the front of the class. - The head of the class. - Yes, I was. Just doing all I could do. - What? - Just good memories. - Mmm. Did I hear that you've gotten married? - I know you didn't. - Again. - Oh! You ain't changed. Yeah, I'm married. Yeah, yeah. I was married. Third time. Probably the shortest one to date. You know me. I never learn my lesson. - Repeat offender. - Yes, repeat offender. Cheers to that. - Cheers. - How about you? How's this dating thing going? - Did I say I was dating somebody? - Oh, no. Okay, you didn't say that. - Nothing to talk about. - Good. Less competition for me. You know how I get. - Is it hot? - Maybe a little. - Um, excuse me. - Okay. - Sorry to keep you waiting. - It's all good. You all right? I mean, I came all this way. I thought you wanted to see me. - I did. - You know, this right here reminds me of last time you left. - Why did you contact me? - Well, you know, I never had no easy time watching you with another man. But then when I saw you with him, I guess the old me rose up and I guess I had to see for myself. - What are you talking about? - The pastor. I mean, a pastor? How is that workin' out for you? I figured you was gonna call me to help you out with your, uh, this show you got goin'. This, uh, what's it called? Sugar & Spice, Grandma Spice now or something. - Uh. I don't know what you're talking about. What are you talking about? - This little online show you got goin' on with your grand, with our grandson. Is he filming it? Hmm? Now, I know you. I know the performer in you is not gonna miss a chance to be in the spotlight. You need the adoration. You don't know what I'm talkin' about? - I don't know what you're talkin' about. Show me. - Where's this thing at? Yeah, this right here. - Look at that. You know what? I mean, you look good. Just hammin' it up. I love this. Let me help you. Let me introduce you to some producers, and we could give this show some clout, you know? I mean, come on, Elise. We get on like a house on fire. It's just business. But it's a business you and I are good at. - Jeff. - Yeah. - Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff. Always working an angle, aren't you? - Oh, come on, Elise. I'm just tryin' to help you. - Ah, these women. - Hey, uh, Patrick came over and was looking for you. Was your phone off or somethin'? He said he called. - Have I not been good to you? - What? - And when you had a need, did I not do what I had to do to meet your need? - Yeah, you've been great, Grandma. What's goin' on? - I saw Jeff, your so-called grandfather, today. - Oh. Oh. - 40 videos. And I watched 'em. I sat in my car and I watched 'em, every one of them. Were you ever gonna tell me? - Can I explain? - What? That, that you wanna make a fool out of me? - What? No. - So you have that little respect for me? That I'm a joke to you? - No, of course, of course not. What? - Why? I mean, why? Why would you do that? - I'm, I'm sorry. Okay? - Are you recording now? - No, no, no, of course not. Look, just. - You liar! Ooh, I can't! I can't trust you! - Did you ever wonder if that's the issue? Not you not being able to trust me. That's normal. You being so overbearing. Don't do this, Derek. Oh, don't forget you need to do that, Derek. I am 19 with no friends and no life! That's not normal! - Hello. I don't have a life. - Please. No privacy, no respect. I think it's time for me to get outta here. Just, yeah. - Oh, yes, yes, yes, it is. And, and, and I can't, I can't believe that I didn't see it sooner! Yes! It's time for you to leave. And I want you to delete that. I want you to delete every one of those! Do you understand me? - Crystal clear. Ugh! - What? What? Uh-huh. - Ah. - Woo! What? What? You see that, huh? You see that? - Yeah, yeah, I saw it, I saw it. - If I win, can I stay? - Nope. - It's okay. I don't wanna stay at your house anyway. Smell like a locker room. - Yeah? - Stinky, sweaty socks. - We got 10 minutes more and I'm taking you to church. Now, June, she's gonna meet us there and you're gonna stay with her and her husband. - Wait, wait, wait, what, what? June? June and her husband? - Yeah. - I didn't agree to all that. I'll bet you they don't even got cable. - Hey, look. I get it now. Comin' from with you and Theresa? I mean, it's bad enough that she shut me out, without, you know, and not even tell me why. You know, give me a heads up. - What you got? What you got? - Yeah, yeah. Watch this. Yeah. - Okay. - I mean, to not know why. See, that's why I was better off being alone. - Okay. - And I liked her. I really liked her. You know. I mean, I know I'm not all that, but I would do anything for her. Why is it that women just can't accept a good guy doing the best he can with what he has? - Man, I don't know. Look at me. - I'm in love with her. I'm in love with that woman. - Did you tell her? - She won't take my calls, she won't see me. And I was the one canceling you. I'm sorry. I get it now. - Does that mean I have to stay with June? - Oh, yeah. You're still staying with June. - Staying with June. Man, I gotta come clean with you. - Yeah? - You're the reason why Theresa kicked me out in the first place. - Me? What did I do? - She says we're no better off when you started counseling us. - Hey, Kenny. What you two do with your marriage is ultimately up to you. I'm just a moderator. - All I ever wanted to hear from her is that she loves me. That's it. - What did you do? - All right. Remember Briella? - Briella? - Briella. - Kenny, do not tell me you cheated on your wife with Briella. - No, I didn't cheat. But I did call her. She's a licensed marriage therapist, and no offense, I think she's got it all together. And you know what Theresa said when she found out? She, uh, she, uh. Oh. - Kenny? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, just. It's not funny. - I'm not jokin', Pastor. Agh! Say a prayer and get me to the hospital! - Are you okay? - Sure. - Does she know you took them all down? If you're shrugging right now I can't see you. Turn on your camera. - No. Not if you're not gonna turn yours on first. - So what are you gonna do? - I've got her car, and I'm gonna look at some apartments later. - I mean, I know this didn't exactly turn out how you wanted it to, but, I don't know. In a weird way, you still got your freedom. I'm sorry I haven't been around. - It's okay. Where have you been, anyway? With your 6th grade Romeo? - No. You know, I remembered why we never actually went out in high school. Complete jerk. - Mmm, but was he a better scene partner, though? - Eh, a little bit. - Okay. - Look, I'm worried about you, okay? - Why? If you think about it, I'm really just some guy you met on the internet. - True. You know, you're also completely oblivious. - Thank you so much. My self-esteem really needed that. - Derek? - Hmm? - Did no one ever teach you how to tell when a girl likes you? If you're freaking out right now, I can't see you. - Did, did, did you just? - Are you serious? Answer! - Now? No! No! Of all the times you want to video chat, you choose now? I look like a bum! - You do know I've already seen you, right? Half the world has, okay? So you pick up right now or I'll end the call. - Hi. - Hi. - I don't think I ever told you my real name, did I? - I'm Corrine. - Hi. I, um, I'm Derek. You, uh. You already knew that. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Oh, this store is so cute! - Thank you! - It's, it's absolutely horrible. - Well, is it any wonder? All that stress? They're at the hospital. - Yes. - Pastor Patrick and Kenny. - Wow. Did they say how bad it was? - I, it's not good. - Ooh, broken hearts. I've had many of those. How much? - God, please surround Patrick with your angels. Please, God. - Grandma? Hey! Hey, Grandma! Hey! - God, I know that I am not perfect. - Grandma! Hey, Grandma! Wait up! - God, I really messed it up with Derek. - Grandma, please! Can we talk this out? I'm sorry! Give me a second, Grandma! Come on! - Show me a sign, God. A sign that I am forgiven. No. Come on. No. Go, go, go, go, go! - I'm sorry! - Oh, thank you, God. You are an on-time God. Thank you. - Thanks for stopping. - I didn't. It did. - Okay, um. Hey, uh. I'm, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you or invade your privacy. I'm sorry. - Oh, Derek, Derek, Derek, it's okay. And I am sorry. Look, I didn't mean to hurt you. You are the most important thing in my life. - You forgive me? - Well, that depends on how close we are to the hospital. - Eh, I don't think you want that answer. - Oh, come on, come on. Think. Think, think, think, think, think. Now on those videos that you do, you have the followists. - Followers. - Followers, followers. Well, I need you to reach out to them to see if we can get a lift. I mean, surely there must be somebody who's close to where we are right now. - Sure, I can, I can start a stream. That, yeah, that'll be fine, I guess. Hey, y'all, listen. I'm back. I don't have much time to explain, but my grandma has to, back up, Grandma, back up. Yeah, but she's here. Go ahead. - Hey, everybody. We need your help. Pastor Patrick has been in an accident and we need to get to the hospital. They don't think he's gonna make it. - We were on our way to the hospital and the car ran out of gas or electricity. I don't know, it ran out of somethin'. But listen, if anybody is in the Buena Vista Heights area, we could really use some help. A ride or anything would help, please. - Please. - Yeah, yeah. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna figure it out. He's gonna be fine. - I have no idea where Elise is, but I called Derek and he's out lookin' for her. - I can't believe this is happening. I mean, if they would just let me be with him, then. - Oh, baby. Oh, boy. - Hey, I think your videos are the cat's meows. Muffin loves 'em. Get in. I'll get you to the hospital. - Yeah, yeah, cat's are fine. I, I love your videos. - Watch out for the cats. - Yeah, yeah, look, we gotta talk about some ideas. Maybe bounce some off of each other. - Sounds good. Let's go. - Oh. I'm so glad you're here. I just want you to know, I, please forgive me. I am so ashamed of- - What room is he in? - Room 222. - I need to hear more about this whole thing with you and Patrick. - Dr. Bruce, telephone, please. Dr. Bruce, telephone, please. - Patrick! Patrick, I am so sorry. And I never got the chance to, to tell you that I knew the reason that you came into my shop. God placed you there. I needed to find my faith walk again, and I found that with you. And I want you to know that even though you lied to me, I forgive you. And that I, I love you. - You do? - So this is what it finally takes? I gotta be near death to finally hear you tell me you love me? - I do love you, Kenny. But if you ever try something like that again, that heart attack that you had will be nothing compared to what I do to you. - Baby, say it again. Say it again. - I love you. - I love you. - Elise. Come here. - I don't understand. I thought that you were hurt. - I'm better now. You said you loved me. - No. - You did. I heard it. - To be fair, I said that to Kenny. - I gotta tell you something. - You lied to me. Now, she told me everything about the two of you, and I saw you kissing her on your porch. - That's why you shut me out? - You can have him. - Oh, this is gettin' good. - You should've spoken to me first. - Oh, man. Oh, this is the jam. - Patrick, we can't go back. This is a trust thing. - Elise, that's Nadine. - Uh, I'm sorry. I don't care to know her name. - Hey, bro. Don't mess with my grandma. - Please, can I have your autograph? - That is her? - That is her. I'm so excited she is here. Oh, I'm so glad I came. - Elise! Elise! Hey, let me explain! Look, Nadine is my sister-in-law! - Oh, that's gross. - She stalks me. - Not anymore. Patrick, I'm sorry. You are free to live your life. - Great! Look, Elise, you are the first person that I have cared about in a long, long time. - So there's no one else? - There's no one but you, the most beautiful, intelligent, stubborn, sugar and spicy thing right in front of me. - Kiss him already, Grandma. - Hey, kiss him! - Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him! - That's my sister! - You and Grandma are about to be famous all over again. - I know. Look at all these people. Oh my gosh. - I gotta say, your likes are through the roof. - How are you- - Never underestimate the power of streaming video and artificial intelligence. - Aw. - And love. - As if we'd forget about you guys. - Hi, vloggers! It's Pam here. Join us today on Derek TV for romance, love, and second chances. - We are here today to renew the vows of love. Kenny and Theresa, you share the joys and blessings along with the challenges of married life. And now I pronounce you husband wife, again. Please celebrate the renewal of vows with a kiss.
