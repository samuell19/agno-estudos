- Yes, Lucius. - What? A poem. Why are you speaking English? Because I'm going to California. Sigga's going to California. No, she's not, she's just studying for her English exam. - No, I'm not. - What? What is that? It's where I'm going to live. You live here. Not anymore. - Hi. - Hi. Come to say goodbye. Why are you speaking English? It's Californian. - No, it isn't. - It is. - Where are you going? - Topanga. You can't be serious? What about me? She's just jealous, I think it's really cool. Do you need a ride to the airport, Sigga? No. My father's gonna take me. No, he won't. Well, I'm gonna go and see afi and say goodbye to him. - Sigga, what about me? - You'll have your own dream. It's my dream to go to California as well. - It is? - Yeah. It is. Then save up. You can join me, but I'm going now. We will keep you safe. We are Sigga's guardian angels. You're having me stay with these two? Him? - Hi, afi. - Hey, Sigga. Come inside. We will stand out here and stand guard. Topanga. I didn't think it would be California, but I am happy it has a name. - It makes me so happy when I look at it... - Hmm. ...the trees and warm sea. It's not much, but you need it now. No, I... I can't take it. I've been saving up. It is yours. Sometimes, you don't know where a journey ends, as your grandmother used to say... I have something for you. Your grandmother's, I kept it. - It's yours now. - No, no, it's special. Please, please. Try it on... It suits you. She always said it's for the darkest nights and the brightest light. - Bye, afi. - Bless you, Sigga. How much money did you get? - I don't know. - That's a lot. We could all go to California with that. When shall I pick you up? - Don't pick me up. - Good. What? Now? This is insane. So, you're leaving now, Sigga? Where are you going? Topanga, it's near L.A. - You have no money. - Grandpa gave me some. So, you're gonna use his money to go to California? It's mostly my own. I've been saving up. I'm going to a poetry class in Reykjavik. And then I'm leaving. Hmm, one class is gonna make you a poet? I have to start somewhere. Sigga, you can be a poet here, you know, in this village. You can buy a house next to ours and you can speak Californian there. Next time you see me... it's gonna be in a photograph, I'm leaving. I'm not taking you to the airport. We are Sigga's guardian angels, we will take Sigga to the airport. Do you know the consequences of your actions? I have brought Topanga, the canoe, he has the answers. - Topanga, the canoe? - Topanga, yes. Do you write poetry, Bjorn? No? So, are you gonna go fall in love over there in California? I'm not going for that. You know, Gunni told me that we are all descended from seven mothers. Yeah, except you. Why do you have to go now? It's the right time. When will we know when that time will be for us? Oh, my God, you won't leave, Jesus! What about us? The land cannot breathe with plastic. I think you dropped this. Can I get a lift? This is not a commercial service, Sir, we are going to Reykjavik. You were going the other way. No, I'm going your way. Hi, who are you? Kata. Sigga is going to California. - You must be Sigga. I'm Nikki. - Hi. Sigga is a poet, we are going to drive her to the airport after her poetry class. Are you teaching this poetry class? No. It's my first one. Oh. - You guys are from the same village? - Yeah. We are Sigga's guardian angels. - I don't need any protecting. - You might. Dreams can be beautiful but, they can hurt. - Pia. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to see you. Ahh. - How are you? - This is my cousin, Pia. - Hey. - And this is Sigga, Kata, Benni and Gunni. - You are cousins? - Oh, yeah, um, his mum is my aunt. - Oh. - We're all related, aren't we? Well, some of us are but others are from another planet. This is another planet. That's why I came back, there's magic here. Uh, Sigga's going to California. We're taking her to the airport. She's a poet. I'm just learning, I don't know if my poems are good or if they're even poetry. I'd love to go to California. And I would love to read your poems. Are they about love? I bet they are. Can we go? Yep. - Bye, Pia. - Oh, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. Yeah, right. - Okay, Pia, I'll see you outside? - Yeah, I'll see you. Okay. Do you need help with that? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah. Where else are you gonna find this? Don't you wanna honor this place by staying here? I'm honoring myself. You've got good friends; you should keep them. It's hard to give up fine, good friends. Yeah, I will. Have you ever been in love? - Not yet. - That's honest. We must leave now. Sigga is going to California. Hey, am I bothering you? Is going to California incompatible with me joining you on your way to Reykjavik? Yeah, I'm sorry. No, it's no worries. Let me throw you a goodbye party, you know, one last hurrah in Iceland. No, thank you. We're leaving in the morning. Sigga. - Girls? - Will there be girls there? - Yeah. - Whatever your poison is, my man. Here. That's my address. Hi. I'm here for the English poetry class. I'm sorry, but that course started a month ago. But you can sign up for next semester. I was explaining, it's too late in this semester to sign up for your class. I... I can't wait 'til next semester. I'm going to California tomorrow. You all wanna take the class? - No, only Sigga. - These are my friends. A poet with bodyguards, excellent. There's always room for another poet in Iceland. Follow me. Gentlemen, as you can see, we have guests. Sigga and her security will be joining us. Sigga, why is it important that you take this class? Um, because... Ah, Sigga is going to California, to be a poet and find her dreams. It's an interesting expression, to find your dreams, as if they've somehow been misplaced, or, maybe they've run away. Uh, I've been dreaming all my life, in the dark, - but I want to live in the light where it's warm. - Sondquist, stop. I think I'm in love. With Sigga? No, she lives in the Snaefellsjokull National Park. She works at a caf√©. - And who's your tomboy live with? - I'm not a tomboy. - Kata is in love with Benni, I think. - No. - Really? - No. I'm not in love with Benni. Sigga, are you in love? No. Henrik, Henrik. Where are you going? Shall... shall I bring him back? Thank you, no, not all poets are happy in love. Lars, read your poem please. I did not know there would be poetry in the class, just talking about it. I like talking about it but, I'm not the poet. We are all poets. Read that out loud, please. - What is it? - It is a recipe for disaster. Iceland, a boat left high up On the black sand A wish denied My footprints Lead up to the beach Where you sat with me? That day and night and dawn When I believed in love And so did the stars I could see them but now I am blind And can only hear Your footsteps leave my heart The sea, picking up stones Leaving them under my feet I am still standing, I am, alone. Your poem is quite sad, but I liked it. Now, uh, your poem. No... it's private. And I don't show my heart to just anybody. Thank you for your class though, goodbye. I'm not in love with Benni. He's an idiot. Sondquist is a good teacher, I think. Where... where's my bag? I don't know, should be inside. It was by the door. Nikki has taken it. You know that guy is a fucking douchebag. It's not in here. Why did you bring a tent? In case there's not enough room for Benni and me. Yeah. It's no less logical than the canoe, live with it. Hi, Grandma, these are my friends. We were hoping we could stay with you. I'm speaking English because I'm going to California. Who did you say you were? I'm Sigga, we met when I was born remember? I'm your granddaughter. Everyone is related because we all come from seven women. $40 a week each and the tent is extra. What about the canoe? Who's he? Is he stupid? He looks stupid. He is stupid, yeah. The canoe is also extra. Grandma, we're only staying for a day, here, I have some money for you. Ah, ah, ah, I don't carry change. - What are you doing? - Writing. I think we should get the suitcase. Yeah. First, I wanna go to my aunt's shop. And then we're going to the party? And then we're getting my suitcase. We can't bring that inside. So will you be going to California, too? Uh, no, I have my own dream. I'm going to open a turtle sanctuary in New Mexico. You didn't tell me about that. Well, it's private. I've been researching it. - When? - Mind your own business. But I like turtles. We share the same interests. Find your own dream. Wow. - You look like a princess. - Thanks. And I look like a tomboy. - No one wants me. - I might. No one that I want. - Yeah, you look nice. - Thank you. Is there something for me? Hi, guys. I'm Fenella. Nice canoe. - You could score with that. - Could I? Joking. You could. Sigga is going to California, we are her friends. I know who you are. I love the coat. Thanks. You're a lucky girl, you know. Slut. Sigga, hi. Hey, you guys, you made it. Your new friend is very attractive, Nikki. - Do you guys like the music? - Yeah. Really? Do you wanna dance? - No, thank you. - Fine. Hey, Jack, this is my old buddy, Jack. Uh, Jack, this is everybody, Kata, Benni, Sigga and Gunni and the canoe. Does the canoe dance? Sometimes, but not professionally. - So, Nikki tells me you're a writer. - Yeah. - Who are your favorite writers? - Poets. Which ones? Actually, if you guys don't mind, um, I have something to return to Sigga. We'll be right back. We will wait here. It's beautiful. I love Reykjavik, not too big, not too small. L.A., man... You get lost there. Do you wanna smoke? No. Good girl. Do you always know what you want? Yeah. I used to think that, too. Then I went to California, it wasn't what I wanted. Perhaps you weren't looking in the right places. Perhaps not. A few years ago I thought my life was gonna blast off like a rocket; I was gonna fall in love, I was gonna write every day, I was gonna be like Dylan Thomas. So I packed my bags and I went, but the dream didn't work out. But I guess we all gotta try, right? Yeah. I can't stay here. Hey, how you guys doing out here? Kata, do you wanna smoke? - Yeah, sure. - Kata? I gotta get my bag. Okay. What do you think? You have great tastes. Um, here's the suitcase, and I'm sorry. I just thought it was the only way that I could guarantee seeing you again. You shouldn't steal. Correct. It won't happen again, cross my heart, hope to die. E. E. Cummings, Dylan Thomas, Naidunia, my favorite poets. - Do you know them? - No. Oh, E. E. Cummings, he'll start at the top corner but he'll never go down the middle, he'll find the side, or jump around... Didn't know you could write like that. I can't. He can. You might. Keep it. - No, I can't. - Yes, you can. It's yours. Hey, have you fallen in love and not going? No. If you don't, you have to tell me because if you don't want him, I do. Hi again, we're shooting my short film next week, you should be in it. - I'm going to... - Wonderland? Here, this will help. Who are you? I'm Sigga. Hmm, you're Nikki's girlfriend. Not his girlfriend. How could you? 'Cause you're leaving, right? I'm Nikki's mother, and I know all about you. You're just like all the others. You're not going anywhere. Why don't you just grow up? I feel like I'm holding love in my hands. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. What will the canoe have? And you, Gunni? Um, he's in love. Do I know her? Anyone else? - I don't know. - No, thank you. Love is hard. Yeah. Nikki? I don't know. Are you still going to California? Yeah, I am. You will have your dream too. Well, if it isn't the poet and her bodyguards, I... I'm pretty sure you were going to America. We liked the last class. - Some of us are still in love. - Thank you. Uh, I have a poem, may I read it? My heart sings for love I did not ask it I was elsewhere On another errand Sent by reasons I misunderstood Then I saw her Love rushed in Crushing everything of mine With the carelessness of a child I found new strength, new fire Until I looked down And saw my fears And then I was lost I could not find my way home Did you write that recently? Today. It's sincere. I wrote it for you. We're shooting my film tonight; you got the main part. Here's where you pick up your costume, it's paid for. - Hello, Sigga. - Hi. - Surprised that I work here? - A little. Come on, I have some things for you. - Don't even think about it. - I'm not. I'm a romantic. - Really? - Yeah. Is the canoe looking for anything? Just friends. It's a horror movie, you're supposed to be a serial killer or something, Jack says. You have such a pretty face. Let me do your makeup. - Hey, is that the poem? - Yeah. - Are you gonna give it to him? - He asked to read it. What the hell? Great, you could come with me. We're about to start shooting. You can put that in the water. - Topanga doesn't like red water. - Then you can leave it upstairs. - Topanga's a he. - How original. Nikki was hoping you could come. Sigga, hi. Hi. - You want a drink? - No. - Fenella? - Yes, please. See, not all of us are perfect. So, did you like my poem? I didn't... I didn't think it was very good but Fenella liked it. I loved it. Is that for me? I'm ready for you. Let me take your things. Why are we here? Talk to me about the dark. I don't want to. - I like the light. - But we all have the dark. It's just a question of finding it. When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I want to feel is the light. How warm, how bright, how strong. The dark is not my friend I thought it was But it isn't You see we all have a dark side. A book under my fingers I would sleep But love made my heart sing But I did not know the words My heart jumped At each new note I knew what sound love makes But the dark is not my friend I know who you are, you're a prostitute. I'm not. - Why... why are you here? - Why am I here? Don't insult me, it's a simple question. Why are you here? I don't want to be here, I want to be happy. And pigs might fly. My friends are in the sitting room, they'd like to meet you. Meet me? Why? They've never met a poet. You can only say you are a poet? Lovely thing to be a poet. Let's go home. There's Pia. Gunni, stop. I am your guardian angel. I'm gonna take you home. Brokenhearted, no drugs. Would you like squishy elephant? Polar bear? They're pleased to see you back. Don't look at me like that. How else would I look at you, I'm your mother. Thank goodness for your friends. What would have happened to you? Topanga says, be patient. You are safe. I should've left by now. I should be in California right now, with my feet in the sand. There's the sea, my cousin. Should I even try again? Yes. Try again. I don't know what's happening to me. Are you in love? While you have a heart, you're alive. What's wrong? What happened? Kata? Nikki has come to see you. Is this your rocket ship? You know, I would never show my heart to anyone like I did. But you just took it and broke it. I'm sorry. I think you're amazing. I wanted to hear your poetry, but I took that moment from you and I'm sorry. In the morning, we are taking Sigga to the airport. Yeah. And we are a bit tight on space, sorry, bro. You don't really have to come. Thank you, Benni, Kata, but I wouldn't miss this for the world. Not any of it. You can sleep in the van. It takes overnight guests. Thank you. I appreciate that. Slept like a prince. Are you ready? Here, let me take that for you. I'll put it in the back. Okay, it's your time, brother. Pia. - Hi. - Hi. Gunni has something to say to you. Uh, that should've been easier. Hey... we're taking Sigga to the airport. - I know, Benni. - Yeah? I'm coming with. I'll see you outside. What are you looking at? You. I think you're beautiful. I think I'm in love with an idiot. - Do we know this idiot? - Unfortunately, yes. It's not that bad. It is though, it's the wrong one. Not if you love him. I am afraid. - Of what? - Of love. Yeah. Me, too. Is it Benni? Yeah. I cannot talk to Pia. You will. I don't want you to go, Sigga. Gunni, let me drive. My last shout, my last glory. Probably dying to get rid of me, one too many poets in Iceland, you're thinking. Oh, Topanga says there's always... Topanga says there's always room for another poet in Iceland. - Los Angeles, please. - Thank you. Uh, so, you're all flying together or... - Uh, yes. I am. - No, we are not. Uh, I'm sorry, Sir, you can't, uh, bring this in hand luggage. We're not taking the canoe. And, also, you can't, uh, drink and fly. Oh, I won't be. Your man will be flying, I will be drinking in the back. Yeah, you're gonna have to speak to my supervisor. - How about an upgrade? - Yeah, you're gonna have to speak to my supervisor. - Okay. - He will be here shortly. Oh, my God, is this a joke? Who wants to fly today? - I do. - Me too. You are too intoxicated to fly. You also need a ticket. If you meet those requirements, you can go wherever you'd like. I'll get a ticket and this is just emotional support, I'm very afraid to fly. - You can take the next available flight. - Thanks. So, from poetry to this. From this to poetry. Good luck to all of you and wherever you travel to. Um, uh, one room please. Uh, we don't have so many beds in one room. I will sleep in Topanga. Yeah, I guess I could sleep in the van. You could sleep in my bed. - And how will you pay? - I'll pay. - Well, you don't have to. - Yeah, I do. Going to the bathroom. Alone. What about my cousin, Gunni? What are you gonna do about her? Are you gonna leave her be and let somebody else pick her up, or are you gonna make a massive, but potentially doomed, attempt to have her? Hmm? What is doomed? Do you think you'll ever have her? Can you leave him alone? Where is your girl? - Sigga! - She doesn't want you. You don't know that. - And how many bags? - One. Be quick, please. Ah. I love you so much, please, please don't leave me. Please... Sigga, Sigga, please don't leave me. Sigga, Sigga, Sigga. - Go away. - Sorry. She needs medical attention. Sigga, I love you. Sorry. Where... where does it hurt? A bigger accident, no drugs, some alcohol. Hello. Sigga, it's for you. Who is it? Who is it? He doesn't say. Ask him if he broke my leg? Did you break my daughter's leg? Fuck off. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. How are you doing? You're still going? I don't know. Go. You'll be fine. Why is this so hard? Topanga says it's too early. When is the right time gonna be then? You will know. Will I? Yes. Nikki told me about this place. Where is he? He's gone to the mountains to find the center of the Earth. They've stopped looking for him. We were gonna do great things together. He saw me, he knew me. You didn't deserve him. Take two of these pills a day. as prescribed on the label. ANTI-DEPRESSANTS I heard you've been brave. Some people told me you had written a poem. Yeah, I... I only went to two classes and I finished neither of them, so, I don't know if it's good. Read it to us. I dream of being a meteor Shooting across the black skies Crackles coming from my shoes Sending me faster and higher 'Til my dreams become true I would wake Hearing the twigs break Under my careful fall And bird wings opening And closing My dream will be Time of snowdrops and airplanes Clouds, waterfalls And the smell of cut grass I'll be back before Christmas. Hmm, I love you. Where's Gunni? I don't think he wanted to say goodbye. Yeah, you know, but he loves you. Hey, it's Gunni, stop. Stop. I'm going to see Pia, if she will have me. I know she will. Drive slowly. I wanna get there.
