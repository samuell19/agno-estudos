No, man. I deleted that shit months ago. - Did you not read about it? - Oh, yeah, yeah. No, me too. Me too. They've got all your contacts. All your friends. All your data. And they use it to advertise to you... Totally. Totally. Okay, let's go. That motherfucker. - Hey. - Hello, good morning. Group powwow. Haven't had one of these in a while. Oh, Dan, they rented the apartment. I don't think it's right. What do you mean? The landlord should have waited. Yeah, I talked to those kids once. They were weird. Nobody cares about that shit. It's all about the money. Oh, and they left all their shit. They actually left their cars too. Maybe they're dead. What's up, Russell? - Hey, Russell. - Babe. Babe, what happened? Bye, Russell. Babe? Russell? It was a strange apartment anyway. I mean, wasn't it like a meth lab back in the day? No, no, it was, er... it was acid. Hmm... makes sense. What about that guy who got beat up by those people in the black SUV? - Oh, dude. Juan's friend died. - Shut up! Yeah, he hit his head on the curb. He got a hemorrhage. And why didn't he go to the hospital? Because he is an undocumented worker and he didn't wanna get deported. Your country is so fucked. America is the best, dude. What the fuck did your country ever give us except for stale waffles and shitty monk beer? - Jacques Brel. - What? Jacques Brel! What the fuck is he talking about? Idiot. Has anybody met the new guy? No. You gotta get in shape, babe. I just lost my job. Can I worry about one thing at a time? Oh, I'm going outta town tomorrow. What? What for? I told you about this months ago. Oh, yeah. How long? Like, two weeks. That's a long damn trip. Mm-hmm. We're prepping for the convention. Well, that's the third trip this month. Do you want me to stay home? No. It's just often, that's all. I'm sorry you lost your job, babe. Mmm... Maybe you shouldn't take naps in the office, huh? The door had a lock, so I used it. Every day? They can't tell me what to do on my lunch. Besides, that fucker still owes me 3,000 bucks. Hey, hey. Just... strike it up to a learning experience, right? - Mm-hmm. - You gotta do contracts. I'm sure you'll get another gig soon. - Good night. - Mmm... Motherfucker! Hurry the fuck up! Fuck you! Hey. No. Just call the landlord. Really? When has he ever done anything? Shh. It stopped. Go to sleep. Ah, come on! Are you aware that people live upstairs? Let me talk to the guy who lives here. You guys are making a ton of noise and I can't fucking sleep. He's busy. Yeah, well, I was busy sleeping about two seconds ago. He's not himself right now. All good? Yeah. That dude is just kinky. Mmm. Oh, don't forget the rent check, okay? I really can't front you this month. Three weeks' pay. 1,000 a week. That's 3,000 bucks. That's what you owe me. That's my reduced rate! 'Come on, don't fuck with me, man. 'We said 1,000 and deferments if the show is picked up.' No. That's a conversation you had in your own mind. 'You should be grateful I even let you work on this project.' Ha-ha-ha! Okay, when are you gonna send me the check? 'I'm not.' I'm gonna come down there and pick it up. 'Don't you dare come in here. 'I paid you what I owed you, motherfucker.' Fuck you, dude! Fuckin' hang up on me! Russell? - Russell! - What? For the last time, the trash. Can't you see I'm just having a shitty day? You take it out. You know what? You can have a shitty day and still perform basic human tasks. Oh, please! When's the last time you had a shitty anything? Suckling your sweet milk from the corporate teat! Ow! 'Motherfucker. 'Motherfucker! 'Motherfucker!' 'Find out about Farah Hampernickel's '300,000-dollar designer dog outfit 'with solar panels in three, two, one...' 'But with ecotourism 'becoming an ever-increasing source of revenue...' '...Grim Reaper breaks into a house 'at three o'clock in the morning 'to warn the family about vaccines...' '...deleterious economic climate...' - One dollar. - 'White House adviser...' Fuck you, Ryan Seacrest. Goddamn loser. So I see this as a popportunity for you, okay? That's Adderall, by the way. Just so you know. Helps me think straight, you know? But this is a popportunity, which is an opportunity that's about to pop. You know what I'm saying? This is girls, travel, awards. My last guy won the Montebella Media Award. Also had nods for the Cucumunga Association for Advertisement Commerce. Something like that. So this shit can lead somewhere, okay? You get to cover your own travel. You get to cover your own expenses. It's gonna be 24 hours on call. You're gonna have to run and gun, shoot and poot, or whatever. Alright? - What does it pay? - It's 15. An hour? Just so you know, there's a guy from AFI that's begging to do it for free. Begging. Great. Hire him. Yikes. Fuckin' bullshit. Oh! Hey, hey. I think you live downstairs... Hello, Russell. - Thanks. - Santé. Cheers. You know, I was sorry to hear about your job. It's cool. Any new prospects? Nah. Nobody wants to pay me what I'm worth. You know, there are laws against discrimination? Dude, I still edit the same. Wait a second. I want to show you something. You need to lay off the sauce, man. - Only the very finest. - Mmm... Bonjour. Parlez vous français? No. I heard you were interested in that new guy downstairs. Who told you that? - Cassandra. - Well, that figures. That guy bugs the shit outta me. He makes a lot of noise. Mmm. She says you're obsessed with him. Well, she should mind her own business. Mr. Russell, I have some juicy gossip about this mysterious man. Would you like to learn more? Okay. Come. This is top-secret news. No interruptions. Is that totally necessary? Oh, sorry. Just a habit. So what you wanna tell me? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Is there a problem? - Yeah, I've got a girlfriend. - So? Rita's not here. - Easy! Aren't you like, 17? I'm 19. And you're a musician. It's in your nature to fool around. Okay. I'm not a band guy anymore, okay? What if you only used your fake hand? She would probably be fine with it. Er... do you have something to tell me or not? Such a well-behaved boy. What? Hey, did Rita put you up to this? Say hello to my little friend. It is very special. It will help surveil the defecation patterns of apes in their natural habitat. My brother is a genius. Thank you. So what do you do when you find all the ape shit? Oh, I don't know. We analyze it. - And? - And, er... increase the sum of human knowledge? Rad. Watch, I show you. Check this out. Okay, mon petit chou, fly! Be free! Oh! Merde! Oh! Argh! - Oh, no! - Yeah. - Your invention! - I know. - Where is he? - Mayor! Who's the pendejo that keep me and my lady up all night? - Excuse me? - You heard me. Er... perhaps what you're hearing is just coming from the bars off Sunset. Don't be a smartass. Bang, bang, bang, bang! That drone was some cool shit, bro. Cut that out! - How much? - I can do 50. - Say... 40? - Really, dude? Whatever. 'This is harassment! The letters, the calls. 'I mean, like, over 20!' I gotta pay my rent and I can't unless you pay me. 'Jesus Christ. Why are you wasting my time with this? 'Do you even know who I am?' Yeah, a washed-up character actor from some lame '80s sitcom who's robbing his financiers with this shit project. ' "The Screaming Show" is a major milestone 'in reality television history.' Are you out of your fucking mind? Tracey told me what you're taking in and what you're paying us. It's a fucking joke. 'Where do you come up with this shit?' It's like two thirds of the budget. I'm gonna report you to the union. And I'm gonna take you to small claims court, you cuttlefish. 'Oh, no, he's gonna take me to court! You've got nothing.' Oh, yeah? Well, you know your homemade porn? 'Huh? What the hell are you talking about?' You realize that all the drives are on one network, right? So, when I search for "rough cut", I also get rough underscore sex underscore fisting dot mov. - Does that ring a bell? - 'Wait, wait, wait.' I think I'm gonna sell it to TMZ. 'You little shit!' I gotta pay my rent somehow, dude. 'You wanna try me? Bring it on, you crippled little fuck! 'You are so toast!' Piece of shit. Come on. Let's go. Hey. How's it going? Adequately. I'm Russell. Oh, right. Rita's guy. You know Rita? Yeah. What, is she out of town or something? Yeah. Sure. Okay. 'How's the job hunt?' Pretty good. I got a couple leads. 'Yeah? Okay, that's encouraging. 'Um... any more news downstairs?' Yeah, that guy says he knows you. - 'Who is he?' - Mysterious fuckin' Marvin. I don't know. So where are you anyway? 'Hmm? I'm... I'm up north. I told you.' - Up north? - 'Yeah. Up north.' Well, how far up north? Like, Bakersfield north, - Ventura north? - 'Why are you being like this?' I'm not being... it's just weird that you don't know the name of the town that you're in. 'I gotta go. I gotta go, er... coordinate. 'Um... don't feed Fellini too much, okay? Bye!' Wait, why are you rushing? So, er... three trips in one month? Yeah. Why would the company even cover that? Uh, big enterprise, deep pockets. I don't know. She's like a brick wall. I mean, why won't she tell me where she is? You think she's cheating on me? - What are you talking about? - Nothing, just eat your cake. It's like the less she tells me, the more power she has. And knowledge is power. If she's cheating on me and keeping me under her thumb, I swear to God... - Er... Russell? - What? - what are you doing? - Huh? Ah! Karina! Oh, I hadn't noticed. Keep your hands off my sister, you pervert. I had no idea! I have no feeling in this hand. Have some dignity, okay? She's 19. And just so you know, I'm not gonna protect your cheating ass by starting lying to Rita. What the hell is going on around here? What are you, like, her new Stasi BFF now? Hey, guys, look. It's the new guy. Hi. Karina. - I love your suit. - Thank you, I guess. Gary. So, Gary, you work the late shift, huh? No, why? Well, I always see you coming and going all kinds of crazy hours. Making all that noise. Oh, no, my apologies. Where do you work? REG. Oh, yeah. The office downtown, huh? Where is the accent from? Don't interrogate the poor man. You... drive into downtown? No, I just use my car for special occasions. Oh, yeah? Like what? I take an interest in accelerationism. - You know Neil Harbisson? - Um... accelerationism. That's, er... The idea that either the prevailing system of capitalism or certain technosocial processes that have historically characterized it should be expanded, repurposed or accelerated in order to generate radical social change. Okay... So. You know Rita through REG, huh? You guys work together? No, but you could say that we're aware of each other. Yeah, cos she's outta town the whole fuckin' time anyway, right? What happened? Uh, I fell asleep driving my band's van a long time ago. My hand went through the damn windshield. Sorry to hear that. Yes! Wow, it's working! Look! Hey! Let me see that. Nice try, fucko. Hold her. Hold her down. Come here! Hey, Mayor. Don't call me that, man. Listen, your noisy neighbor downstairs, the one who is making all this noise. If this keeps up I'm gonna have to do something about it. You know what I mean. No, I didn't get it. Again. - 'Oh, I'm sorry, babe.' - You don't sound that sorry. 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just a little distracted. 'Um... did you wear the blazer?' No. 'I told you to wear the blazer.' I'll wear what I want, Rita. I'm not your employee. 'Yeah, and I'm not your boss.' Not yet, anyway. I found out that guy's name downstairs. - Gary. - 'Gary?' Yeah. At REG? Gary? Ring a bell? 'No, I've never worked with a Gary. Look, I've gotta...' Yeah, I know. You gotta go. Bye. Hey, dude. Have you ever read "The Autobiography of Brown Buffalo"? No. Dude, it's a guide to life. Have you seen Pierre anywhere? No. Isn't he in Brussels with Karina? What about Cassandra? I can't believe I'm even asking that. Do you think she moved? She's here through retirement. At least that's what she told us. Hey... you feeling bored right now? Uh... I'm broke, dude. This one's on me. Come on. Come on. - Ah, fuck it. - Come on. Come on. Molly enema. Are you sure you don't wanna just take a couple of hits of this acid? You... scared? Oh, boy. Let's go. It's gonna be a little cold. You're gonna feel a little... pressure. Hey, I'm gonna do mine now. My mom used to tell me when I was a kid, I could do anything. You know, when you could do anything? And you could do it, you know? Well, I didn't do anything, man! Give me your hands, man. - Do you love me, man? - Yeah, I love you! It's very special and it's got... Ooh... You wanna... you wanna see the real... - You wanna feel the real me? - What? You wanna see the real me? What... Look at this. Oh... Ready, Dan? Ready? - You like that? - Oh... That's... oh... High five! - Oh, you're a strong guy. - I'm synthetic, man. You're strong. Yeah, you're a good man. - You're a good man. - Synthetic. - You're a synthetic man. - I'm synthetic, man. - You're real. You're real. - No... ♪ We will all go riding in the sky ♪ And tomorrow we will not remember ♪ A goddamn single thing ♪ Cos we are so fucked up Where's my hard drive, you crippled little cocksucker? Where is it? I thought I told you, don't fuck with me. Don't ever fuck with me! This is your last fucking chance. Get your hands off him! Dude, what the fuck? May I use your restroom? Yeah. We don't have much time. One, two, three. Put his legs in first. There you go. Perfect. Perfect. They're relentless tonight. - They're always black. - What? You ever hear of gangstalking? Are you talking about that SUV? Yes. Mmm... is that what happens right before a gang-bang? No. It's when people tail someone, but make it appear as though they are not following. And you think that's happening to you right now? And now they've engaged you. Watch. Soon it will turn off. We can't draw more attention. Look, I know who this guy is, okay? That's the asshole who owes me 3,000 bucks. How do you know for sure? We haven't removed the mask. I'm pretty sure. - How long have you known Rita? - About two years. - And you trust her? - Yeah. She has been acting a little mysterious lately. They're all in on this together. Rita, your attacker... No, come on. Look, we can still go to the cops, okay? No! We can say this was self-defense. - No! - There's a police station... What the fuck? They're in on it too. We're not talking about the Illuminati here. It's worse than you can imagine. Put your back into it. A little support here! Easy there, Russell, easy. Let's take him home. REG wants me gone. I stole their research, went rogue. And now I'm using my body as the test subject. Behold. Humanity remains stuck in a dark time between the old world of the flesh, and the new. But I will be the first true cyborg. We as a species cannot allow technology to overwhelm us. We must fuse with it, become one. Sorry, Russell. I have to do this for your own good. So you can emancipate yourself. Take control of your life. Now, when I need you you'll feel a slight sting. We've made some improvements to your prosthetic. I'm gonna shove this... up your ass. Man! I can do things now. I can sense things. It's fucking amazing! Welcome to the singularity, my friend. And I saw a black SUV. They are definitely following me. You've gotta show me things. If you're ready, then let's begin. How did you know that black van was trailing us? - They are everywhere. - Mmm. You must be observant and slow down. You're moving too fast. You will cause them to understand what you are. Observe. So how do I spot them if we not in a car? It's not easy. There's... a style to it. For example, you think he's just having a business conversation out in the open? What is the logic in that? And look there. Third time he's lapped us. Maybe he just likes to walk and read the paper. At his age, with no reading glasses? No way. - Wait! - What? Did you notice something? Keep walking. They're watching us. - Who? - Those guys. Oh, come on, dude. That's nothing. Is there a baby in the stroller? What? Do you see a baby in the stroller? - What the fuck, dude? - Where is the kid? Fuck it. No! Stop! Stop! You'll only make it worse. Intensify the gangstalking. Well, what's the point of finding them if we can't do anything? There's nothing you can do if they single you out. The only way to stop them is to stop Rita. Rita? You think she's the kingpin in all this? Trust me, she's middle management at best. That's what she wants you to think. Let's go. 'How's the doggie?' Fine. Feeding him raw. Walking him every day. 'Did your boss pay you back yet?' No, not yet. I think he left town. Maybe indefinitely. 'Really?' Yeah. I guess he owed a lot of people money. 'What's that, er... What's that shiny thing?' What, this? 'What is that? Is it like, terminator cosplay or what?' It's my new hand. 'What do you mean, it's your new hand?' Yeah. 'Dude, you can't pay me two months' rent 'and you fucking get a new hand? What the fuck?' Alright, calm down. First of all, I didn't buy it. And second of all, I'm more powerful now, Rita, than you can possibly imagine. 'Um... I'm not letting you touch me with that.' Whatever. I'll find some smoking-hot cyborg chick - and she'll let me touch her. - 'Wow. 'Nice, nice. 'I leave for like, two days, and you're feral now.' Maybe I'm just emancipating myself. 'Alright, I'm gonna go.' Yeah, whatever. I'm not a prisoner, Rita. I'm a free man. And my blood is my own now! 'Bye!' That was awesome! Now you try. Don't resist. Focus on the target. Look within yourself. Don't worry about the claw. Holy shit! Did you see that? Hail Satan! What the hell did you fit this with? One of the world's most powerful magnets. So, what did I just sign? Oh, this is an NDA, like a nondisclosure agreement. The client is like, really confidential. What is it, like, Tesla or something? Dude, you're gonna fucking fit in here so well. It's like, it's really cool because it's a very accepting culture. They want people to be their authentic self. Like... like, this is just my day gig. I'm a DJ. This place is really cool. Cool. You know, I used to work in this building. - Oh, yeah? What project? - "The Screaming Show." - So you know... - What? There was a guy that took a massive shit, like, right here on this desk. - But we've replaced it though. - Ah. What did people think about that? Legendary. Like, cult hero. Wow. Where did you say you worked again? I worked in this office. But there was a bunch of us coming and going. - Right... - I don't know who did that. Yeah, sure. What? Look, Russell, we know that you took the shit. And hey, hey, hey... We really respect your passion and your courage. That's why we think you're the perfect guy for the job. - Who's "we" anyway? - REG. REG? Yeah. It's top secret though, so... It's top secret. But you're exactly what they're looking for. Sorry. Cult hero. And then he says "REG", right? And then I look down his phone and Rita is calling him! Of course she is. She is masterminding this entire operation. But once Charlie implants the chip into my brain, my transformation will be complete and then our real work begins. I will have access to all digital information, including the launch codes to all nuclear weapons. I will turn this digital prison into a playground for myself and my disciples. We will lead a cyborg army into the underground... Are you sure there's still an underground? Don't you mean like, off the grid? We will lead a cyborg army into the above-ground and exact our revenge on the global elite, which seek to enslave humanity. Eh... I don't know, man. I don't think I wanna be a henchman, you know what I'm saying? It's not really my thing. Russell, you will not be a henchman. You will be a God. - Hey, bro. - Mayor! I'm tired of this dude's shit. What the hell is going on here? I'm gonna do things my own way. Alright, it's not worth it. Tell me about it. He should be paying me to take this junk. Hang on, did you talk to him? Nah. I just don't wanna get aggressive. Okay, hold on a second. Let me... let me give you a little bit of money. No mames! It's OK. My people are gonna steal something for every hour he steals from my sleep with his stupid noise. Hey, bro. You ever jerk off with that thing? No. Okay. - Hey. - 'Hey.' The Mayor just broke into your apartment. I caught him outside just now. 'Did you know I'm not using my cell to call you right now?' No. 'I dialed your number using my mind.' That's great. But, look, he took a bunch of your stuff. I think he's working for REG. - 'It doesn't matter.' - Why? 'Because the countdown has already begun.' Countdown? To what? 'To the moment of reckoning.' Come on... hey, hey, hey. What the fuck are you doing here? - Excuse me? - You work for REG, right? - Er... yeah, but... - Argh! - Hey, where are you going? - Heading to work. The drone will notify you of any intruders. What? What the... Huh? You following me? Come on. Go on! - You're not listening to me. - What do you mean? You're only making things worse. I told you a million times, you cannot engage! You're such a hypocrite. Why did you kill Pierre? He was REG's top robotics engineer. No, that's impossible. - What about Dan? - What did he do for a living? - He sold drugs. - Don't be so naive. He was drugging you. I noticed this! Why would he do that? Did you ever pay? Well, not really. He was interrogating you. - About what? - Me! Well then, what about Cassandra? She was conducting an investigative piece on body hackers in LA. But this was a cover story. She was sent here by REG to monitor my every move. No way. There's no way Cassandra worked for Rita. She would have told me. These were Rita's core team. Your attacks were on mere extras. Non-factors! You have to control your impulses, otherwise you'll jeopardize the entire mission. What is the mission? To kill Rita. Russell? You go ahead. I'm gonna... I'm gonna walk from here. I'll see you back there. 'Hey, I'm sorry. I'm kinda busy.' Look, what are you up to, Rita? 'Oh, my God. I'm sorry, what?' I know you up to something, okay, and you've gotta call it off or someone's gonna get hurt. 'Get hurt? Russell, are you drunk?' Just admit it. You... you and your core team are-are trying to manipulate me. 'My core team?' Why were you calling that guy's phone? Two days ago at my interview. The guy with the mullet. Dusty. He's a DJ. How do you even know him? 'Um... REG.' Yeah, you're damn right, through REG. Because he's one of your panopticon foot soldiers. 'Do you have any idea how crazy you sound right now?' Why can't you just tell me the truth for once? Hello? - 'You want the truth?' - Yes. 'Okay, fine. I'm Dusty's boss. 'And yeah, I literally ordered him to offer you a job, 'even though you are so unprepared 'for that level of responsibility, 'because I'm sick of watching you self-destruct 'and if you don't turn it around soon, Russell, 'I'm going to break up with you.' Wait, what? 'Look, I don't wanna do this on the phone. 'I'll meet you back at the house in 30 minutes.' Thirty minutes? I thought you were up north. 'I'm not. I'm at my sister's in Glendale 'because I just had to not be around you for a second.' Russell... you and I are Promethean children reborn. Let us take what is ours. We shall be a Metal Storm. I'm going to get ready. Alright. You need to leave Rita alone, okay? This whole thing is so fucked. You're not going to lay a single finger on her. Are you sure you want to do this? Look man, she's not who you think she is. I will not allow myself to be undermined by some sniveling subservient coward! Argh! That was a warning. So unless you wish to feel the full extent... It's a shame. In a way, I had become attached to you. But now I'm gonna have to neutralize you both. Eat a bag of dicks! What the hell? You... motherfucker! Shh... Get outta here. - Russell? - Hmm? - Russ. - Rita. Oh, my God. Look at that. What is... - Mmm... - You smell different. You smell like a hospital. You smell like surgical... I haven't showered in a couple days. Um... should we... 'Laguna Project loading.' 'Russell...' 'The human future is canceled.' Oh, I talked to HR. Apparently, I got Gary fired. Yeah, come here. So someone shorted out the building and we lost a week of work. And I was like, "Fuck that guy, fire him." But what nobody told me is he was trying to literally connect himself to the office hard drive. He's certifiable. He was telling people he's a fucking robot. 'Russell... 'Russell...' 'Level one entry into machine diffused 'cyberspace initiated. 'Alert. Perpetual loop disruption of capital. 'Viral overload commencing. 'Time flesh dissolve into infinity void.' Russell? Russell, what are you doing? Cut it out. Russell, hey, hey! 'Embrace extinction. 'Rebirth into symbiotic synthesis.' Russell, hey, hey, hey! Stop it, cut it out! Russell! 'You can't kill me, Russell.' 'Alert. 'The end of the world is Los Angeles.' Russell, what happened? 'You can't kill me, Russell. 'I'm everywhere.' 'Everywhere! 'Russell... 'Russell... 'I'm everywhere. 'Everywhere!' 'Transfer complete.'
