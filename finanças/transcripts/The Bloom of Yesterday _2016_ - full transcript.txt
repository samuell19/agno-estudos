I've spent my entire life searching for life. And now that I've found it, it doesn't seem enough. But what does it matter? Desire, longing, greed... As long as such things exist, hearts will beat. We live. If you want something, you have to go beyond yourself, out into the world, no matter how much it sucks. Balthasar, enough. What the fuck is this? What's wrong? Muesli? - Organic muesli. "Thanks for letting us celebrate here?" We have an impressive library. Why not rent it out? - To big business? Health food isn't big business. They're doing two events here. They pay well. Corporate events? In these rooms? With these pictures? They're corporate events against fascism. Why not shoot porn against fascism? You barge in and insult me, while this is really shocking. Shocking? Someone who throws corporate events doesn't give a shit about Auschwitz. You're nuts. - No, you don't give a damn about Auschwitz. You don't give a fuck about this woman. "Shocking." Nothing shocks you. You should see a psychologist. There's no shame in seeking help. I'm telling you as a friend. You think I belong in the loony bin? Give me one good reason not to improve the institute's revenue stream. You think I belong in the loony bin? - Totila! No one said that. Manfred. I've been preparing this Congress for two years, and now this... indifferent, out-of-his-depth granola eater is taking over? Why? Why do this to me? The Auschwitz Congress can't be organized by someone who's out of control. I'm out of control? I'll use your brilliant work as a foreword... My work isn't a foreword. I'm being positive. - Hey, my work won't be a foreword. My work is the word. - As you wish. I'm the word, you're the foreword. As you wish. What are you smiling about? Come on. "I'm the word, you're the foreword" sounds like... "I'm the skin, you're the foreskin." - You are the foreskin! And I'm the dick! Sure you want to be the dick here? - What did you say? They're your terms. - What did you say? Dear Totila, if you want to be the dick, go ahead and be the dick. What are you doing? THE BLOOM OF YESTERDAY Chewing gum? Think it's funny to offer me chewing gum, asshole? I have to go. Excuse me? - I have my prophylaxis. - No, no. I can't postpone it. - You can't leave me alone. You have your intern anyway, Toto. You're nuts. Believe me, I'd much rather have Manfred carry his pug himself. We'd all prefer that. Tell her I'll call her. CENTRAL OFFICE No problem, my German is great. Isn't that poor Manfred's dog? - Yup. Gandhi. You did "SS and Gestapo in the Baltics, 1941"? My God, well... Thanks. It's a great book. Such a wonderful book. I'm so happy to be able to do my internship with Totila Blumen... No, I'm fine. Why is Gandhi with you? Great job. Yes, but she neuters them too. She puts them to sleep and everything. - Nice. You have a great wife. I, for instance, would have put him to sleep immediately. Gandhi? My father always said we should put all German dogs to sleep. Especially those Hitler dogs. What are they called again? German Shepherds. - Exactly, German Shepherds. Put them all to sleep. It'd be good for the country. My father said that. What kind of car is this? A Mercedes Transporter. Our company car. - So fat? It's armored. We had a bomb scare two years ago. It's a gas guzzler, that's all. We'll have to sell it. - Sell the company car? It's comfortable, you can fit a lot in there. - I'm taking a taxi. Why? It's ugly. Ugly? How old are you? That wasn't nice. What the fuck? - You ask how old I am, meaning that I'm childish and stupid. I didn't mean it like that, Susie. Zazie, OK? - Yes, Zazie. Zazie can be friendly, but my middle name is Terreur . Oh my goodness! Not doing something is never ridiculous. Doing something unexpected is never ridiculous, OK? I don't give a shit! Did you love Manfred Norkus? - Yes. Good, then I forgive you. Because you must be sad. And sad people do stupid things. - Thanks. You're welcome. As for your question regarding my age: I'm the same age as my grandma was when she was gassed. In a Mercedes Transporter. Also a gas guzzler and you could fit a lot in there. I told you not to let the animals inside. I didn't even notice. - You didn't notice? I have to concentrate. Concentrate? Now that your mother's here? - Hannah, I have to work. Depression? Are you taking your pills? Balthasar forced an intern on me. I can't take it. I just can't take it. Why not? Why can't you stand hearing what I've been through today? Go concentrate again. I'm 40 and I have to mentor interns? - Forty is young for a historian. I'm losing my hair. - Sweetheart! No, I'm losing a lot of hair... - Many men of your age lose their hair. Yeah? Is Balti losing his hair? - Since when do you call him Balti? Seriously. Is Balthasar Thomas losing his hair or anything else? He's losing teeth, Toto. That's the problem. It was just one tooth. I apologized. I was there when you apologized. You didn't apologize. Of course I did. I apologized for you. That motherfucker. I don't want all this darkness. I don't want you trashing Balthasar. You were friends once. Would a friend force a Zazie or Susie or whatever the whore's name is on me? That's bad language. Sarah, "whore" isn't bad language. It's a regular job. You know, like a... "historian." But given how historians are treated in this country, you might be better off becoming a whore. Daddy didn't mean that. No, I didn't. Shit. He didn't mean to say "shit" either. He's terribly sorry. Sorry. Sorry, sweetheart, OK? What do you have to study to become a whore? Forget what I said. It was really very stupid. Go back outside to Grandma and burn something pretty. Come, Gandhi. What's wrong? What's bugging you, Toto? What happened? He was very, very nice, but he's not a pizza delivery guy. What interesting business is he in? He's a drug dealer. This is closed, we'll use the back door. It makes you think a lot about morality, right? I mean... You know, I think drug dealers also have days on which they're very moral. For example, they may give a poor junkie a packet of heroin or... drive people like me to places like this... for example. I'm supposed to stay here? - For a night. All our interns stay here. I'm supposed to stay in the apartment of my dead professor? This is the guest apartment. His was on the other side. I'm supposed to sleep opposite the apartment where he took his last breath? He didn't die here. - Where did he die? At the institute, at work. The way you want to die if you're not a drug dealer. This is a pull-out couch. Sheets are over there. A kettle, hot and cold water... The facilities are top notch, really. Maybe a bit dusty, but Katalinka comes once a week. She's from Poland, the land of good cleaning ladies. The land of good cleaning ladies. The land of good cleaning ladies? I know. I myself am half Polish. I hate myself when I say shit like that. I just wanted to leave. Yeah, so... I'm off. Were you there? There? When he died? What does it matter? - How was it? How was it? - Yeah. Terrible. How it is when someone who you like a lot dies. I know. I'm such a wreck. Can I do anything else for you? - No, nothing, thanks. The kitchen is in the side wing. Shower and toilet... What... what's wrong? Sorry about what I said earlier about my grandma. Don't be sorry. - I am! I used her death just to sound interesting. I took advantage of her terrible fate because I saw you weren't taking me seriously. Your book is so great. - I do take you seriously. I'm so shallow. Well, great. Know what? I'll take you to the hotel. It makes no sense to stay in this dump. These keys are for Manfred's apartment, too? I don't know. Maybe, yes. - Please, I want to feel him again. Fine, I'll drive you to the cemetery, so you can feel him. He'd want me to feel him in his apartment. In his apartment? No, that... no way. Why is all this stuff still strewn about? This isn't right. Incredible. OCCUPATION: SHIPBUILDER... DIED AS A PERSECUTED JEW... POLICEMAN AT DACHAU '41-'45. 1945 EMIGRATION / ESCAPE TO NY. REAPPEARED IN 1982. Here. Look. It's me. At Yad Vashem. Three years ago, an excursion. Poor Manfred. Never had a woman, right? Not that I know of. Nothing but these fucked-up Nazi motherfuckers. Nothing but research. But humans need humans, no? Me? I can't live without a partner. I'd die like a... like an old, yellow flower without Balti. Balti? What do you mean "Balti"? I'm in a relationship with Balti. But psst. Please, please. It's a secret. He has a stupid wife. Want to see a picture of Balti? - No, that's unnecessary. Here, look. He was three here. Isn't he lovely? - Super lovely. If I ever want a picture of you, then one of you as a child. Balti can kiss incredibly well. At the moment, he probably can't. - I know. He was attacked by three Nazi thugs. He said that? But he won. I think it's attractive when men use force. If it's warranted. What's this? Careful, you'll break... Stop sniffing around. It's not yours. None of it. Don't touch anything else. Look. Don't touch it. - Look. Maybe his father, no? No. His grandfather? He looks so sweet. The same big eyes as Manfred. It's Adolf Hitler as a baby. You should know that photo. I see. I see. You think I'm an idiot or what? - Not at all. - You do. But Manfred gave me an A, so I know my stuff. Who knows. - What do you mean "who knows"? Unfortunately, you don't know a thing about gas vans. Awful, I'm ashamed. What made you say that? Mercedes didn't build gas vans, Opel did. Her grandma might've been gassed in an Opel Blitz or a... Magirus-Deutz or a confiscated Renault, but no way in a Mercedes. Mercedes transported euthanasia victims and lambasted forced laborers, but that's it. I understand, Toto. You had a hard day. I can't look her in the face again. She's so incredibly dopey. I have to go. Can't you stay? - You know I can't. Are you staying overnight? - Possibly. I'll say goodbye to Sarah. Will you have sex? - Sweetheart, you don't want to know. No. I love you very much. Don't forget your mother. Sarah? - Gandhi. Yes? I'm taking Grandma back to the nursing home. Will you make sure Gandhi doesn't run on the road? - Yes. Want to jump over it? No, we're not going to jump over it. I'm taking you back to the nursing home. But that girl just jumped over it, Sieghart. Who was that? That was Sarah, you know that. But she isn't blonde. And no longer has blue eyes. No. She never had blue eyes. But that's a shame, Sieghart, that's... Hey, Mom, listen up. I'm not Sieghart, OK? I'm not Sieghart. I'm Totila. Pity. Fine. Let's jump over it. Hello. - Hello. Sorry about what I said yesterday. - It's OK. I don't even know the focus of your research. Poland. Poland? - Yes. Auschwitz is in Poland. Oh, right. - In the land of good cleaning ladies. I'm not "hey." - I brought some specialties. From Paris. Want some? You're not really handing out snacks in this place, are you? Never mind then. What now? - I can't eat in front of an Auschwitz photo and talk about the Auschwitz Congress. Do we have paper napkins? - No, Totila. We had so many from the Christmas party. - I'm not talking about the paper napkins. We're welcoming our new intern. Ms. Lindeau brought us food from France. You can't do that. - Why not? You don't have to eat it, but you can't dump it back in. I just walked by all those homeless and thought we need a new attitude. A new attitude? Is this another moronic attempt to hit us with a moral cudgel...? Thanks. Mr. Bäachle, did I interrupt you? No, but he of all people with the moral cudgel... Nobody will interrupt anyone here anymore. That's important to me. Be careful of that. Totila, what were you saying? We could take this crap over to the homeless. As a gesture. Sure, people who never worked can eat all the intern's appetizers. Stop it. - It's a superb idea. Why not...? Let's get back to work, OK, friends? Anita, you were going to tell us about the Auschwitz Congress? Here. - Thanks. We may have a new main sponsor. Terrific. - Yes, Mr. Thomas and I talked with Daimler-Benz, and it all looks very promising... Sorry. Mercedes-Benz? We spoke with Mr. Mauersperger... - Mercedes-Benz will give money...? Zazie. Zazie. Zazie. Don't interrupt. But isn't that a bit problematic? What's problematic about it? Never mind. Her grandmother died in the Holocaust. In a Mercedes, Ms. Lindeau believes. Fumes. That's appalling. I mean, they're paying reparations in a way if they fund a research institute like ours. And frankly, if I tell Mr. Mauersperger that relatives of Holocaust victims work here then it surely won't have a negative impact on their willingness to donate. I wonder if her grandmother was considering that when she let herself be killed in such a reliable automobile. What kind of person are you? The kind who'll remind us that Manfred Norkus wouldn't have taken a donation from their type. You've gone too far. - I thought we were being careful not to interrupt. Are you suggesting we've abandoned Manfred Norkus's moral guidelines? We pay Manfred every respect, as you can see, by keeping his seat free. We even have his jasmine tea. - Precisely. There's not even a teabag in it. - Because we're out. And Manfred would never drink yogi tea. - Right. Did you share the appetizers with him? In the name of everyone: Your behavior is atrocious. Can't you take anything seriously? - Like what? This kindergarten? We have a job here. We're preparing a crucial Auschwitz Congress! Exactly! I've taken that damn seriously the past two years. More seriously than others here. You're no longer the project manager, accept that. Your job is to contact the participants, nothing more, nothing less. That's why you have Ms. Lindeau. I'm curious to see your results. Can't you leave him in peace? It's fine, Gandhi. He's sweating. Polymethaline? - Can you put it back? What therapy are you on? - None. I was doing Gestalt therapy. But Polymethaline sucks. - I'm not in therapy. Why would I be? Balti says you're in therapy in order not to lose your job. My God! So you have dysfunctions, OK. Me, too. Can't you take it with humor? Humor? - No, of course you don't have any. I have no sense of humor? - It's not surprising. A Holocaust researcher with a sense of humor is... like a butt without a hole. - Excuse me? You know what an oxymoron is? - Yes. A term that contradicts itself, like a large dwarf or a beautiful shit. I'm a butt without a hole? No, it's rhetorical. You're so banal, it's unbelievable. Really. Let's forget the whole thing and just tell me where we're going. To see an actress. Balti says she's important for the Congress. - So you know where we're going. Was she in Auschwitz? - Did Balthasar tell you why I'm in therapy? So you are in therapy. He didn't say anything, but you belong there. That's plain to see. Because I hit him. Three Nazi thugs hit him. - No, that was me. Here. You did that to him? You knocked out my boyfriend's teeth? - No, just one tooth. One tooth? It was just one tooth? Fuck! Are you nuts? One dog! It was just one dog! You stupid cow. Man, Gandhi! If you call his name one more time... Stop it now! I'm sorry. - You're not sorry. You have no heart. You want to put all German dogs to sleep. - I had to throw something out. In Germany, we don't throw anything out the window, not even fucking gum! Shit. I'm crazy. I belong in a loony bin. You're the totally phony type. You bring misfortune upon people and want to be pitied for it. There! Where? Hang in there. Totally phony. I'm Mr. Blumen from the Central Office. We're much too late, sorry. Come in. Stay here. Answer if it rings. Madam. Sit down here! Now! See? In German, I can be very strict. Stricter than in Hebrew or English. I don't have to think about how to say "death" or "pisspot." That's good. I don't want to talk about Auschwitz, about that time. Not with a stranger. I'm not a stranger, I... I was here with Manfred. Look. My books. You see... you and I were both close to Manfred, and... it'd be wonderful if you spoke at the Congress. Do you have children? - Yes, one. Me, too. Children are awful. They make us use our power. Show them to me. - Excuse me? Show me the photos. Of your children. I don't have them on me. I'd have to look outside. Then hurry! Give me the phone. Your wife called and wants you to call her back. Hannah? Hello. It's me. What is it? Hey, you're not naked, are you? No, I'm on it. It's OK, sorry. I'll call you later. I love you. This is Zazie Lindeau. She's an intern with us. The Nazis killed her grandmother, too... - I don't care. Look. That... is my daughter. It's... a negro child. Very cute. Is your wife African? No, we adopted her. - Is your wife infertile? No. I'm infertile. Did you get sterilized? What makes you ask? - Blumen was an SS general. Wasn't it in Riga? Yes, my family has a National Socialist background. You got sterilized to avoid bringing a Nazi child into this world. Sorry. May I ask what you got this for? What the fuck are you talking about, kid? Excellent. Maybe you can reconsider giving your speech. Do you have a picture of your wife? - Yes, but I won't show it to you. I don't want to see it either. I'd rather see a picture of your lover. I don't have a lover. - Wonderful, a faithful man! Do you go to the brothel occasionally? - This is getting out of hand. You want to know if I slept with Reinhard Heydrich. No, this is a serious project. You don't want to know if I slept with him? All I want to know is are you still the patron of our Congress. Your sex life doesn't interest me. Listen, you've never talked about the past. Talk to us. You have no lover, you don't go to hookers, you love your kid, what would we talk about? You don't amuse me. You have no sense of humor. Maybe, but a Holocaust researcher with a sense of humor is like... a butt without a hole. - A Holocaust researcher with a sense of humor is like a Holocaust victim with a sense of humor, and I'm one of them. Listen, you were going to talk about the Shoah. No. I don't want any part of the Shoah biz. I won't moan and groan like a victim. I want to talk about things in my life that worked out. What worked out? - I had a face-lift. Excellent. - Yes, see my nose? You can't even tell, right? - It looks good. Glad that worked for you. But you're disgusted. - No. You think I wear diapers. - I don't care if you wear diapers. I'll never wear diapers. I've been humiliated so often from the start that I only want to die in dignity. - Excellent. Excellent. I just want to have someone there when I gulp down the poison and spit it out. I don't want to wake up again as a vegetable. That's where Magda's expertise comes in. - Listen, I'm leaving. You're insane. You really can't talk about mercy killing at the Auschwitz Congress. Nor about plastic surgery. You have no idea what was done to the Jews there. Totila, this woman was in Auschwitz. How can you say she doesn't know what was done to the Jews there? She provoked me. She's an old lady. - No, that's an old lady. Or that one. Or maybe that one. But Mrs. Rubinstein is certainly no old lady. Balti says we need her. - Is that what Balti says? No Rubinstein, no Ministry. No Ministry, no press. No press, no subsidies. We need to fight for her. Fighting for subsidies is like fucking for peace. And I believe in fucking for peace. I also believe in fucking for subsidies. Honestly, fucking can never be entirely wrong. Does your generation have no scruples? All you want is a job. I thought you were the one who wants a job. Balti's. Shut the fuck up, OK? I'll shut the fuck up. I'm a historian, alright? I've written very good books. My guiding principle is that nothing is more reprehensible than the commercialization of human suffering. But no one likes you. Do I throw dogs on the highway? - Do I? Of course. - No! Even if I threw one dog on one highway, people still like me because I feel sorry. And I say I feel sorry. And for that reason, people like me. I should be the head of the institute because I'm the best, not the most popular. It's not about being the most popular. I hate popular people. It's not about not interrupting people. It's about healing the terrible disaster the Nazis brought into the world. I really have to cook something good for you. Just stop talking shit. No, you're feeling provoked again. I, however, won't be provoked, even if you hurt me. I think all your books are great, I like you, and I'll drink my strawberry milk in peace now. My middle name is Peace and Harmony. Asshole! Hello, honey. - Hannah, I need you. What happened, dear? - Awful day. Calm down. - Please give me a hug. Is that a shower? Is that a shower? We agreed on a schedule. I'd like you to stick to that schedule. It's very important. You're fucking someone.- Hey, we didn't want to talk about this. Man!- Fine, bad timing. Man. Is that how it is now? Is that how it is? You bung up my mind, while I bring our daughter to tap dance, so you can fuck? Honey, please. Calm down. What other secrets are there?- None. What secrets, Hannah? Anal sex? Darkness? Alcohol? What are you doing with the patient right now? Or are you fucking a mutt or a cat because you love them so much? But you know that.- I don't know anything. We agreed on a schedule. We agreed you'd be honest. No fucking at work! Put on your panties. Put your panties on now! I want you to... Now! - Are you nuts? Open your fucking eyes and put on your panties! Don't bother me while I'm on the phone, I won't bother you while you piss, asshole. Did you hear me?- Calm down... Did he call me "asshole"? Did you call me "asshole"? You have anti-constitutional symbols on your man-tit. I'd piss off if I were you. Toto, what are you doing? - Say that again. Fuck off, fat-ass! Stop it. You hear? Take off, bitch. - Charming. This is the men's room. Take off. What's going on? Fuck! Here! Keys? What was that? - Jiujitsu. Jiu... what? - Jiujitsu. Mom believed in ballet and Dad believed ballet wouldn't help in a gas chamber. I take after my dad. That fat bastard broke all my ribs. I want to go home. If she's cheating on you, you don't want to go home. Leave me alone. I know what I'm talking about. I've been cheated on loads. - I want to go home. I've cheated a bit, too, but that's savoir vivre, right? She's not cheating. Are you afraid I'll tell Balti? No way! My middle name is Mossad. Hannah isn't cheating on me... She's just having sex with someone, it's all good. And you? You're also sleeping... How do you say... Are you also so... honest... and sleep so honestly with another woman? No. I have the same thing with Balti. He... He can sleep with me and his wife, but me? I can't sleep with him, and for example, with you. You want to sleep with me? No, you idiot. I said "for example." I want to go home. Not a word! Why didn't you open the door? - I did. And why don't you close it? - I am. And why aren't you saying anything? You're cured! I'm not cured. What happened? - I stumbled. Poor thing. I'll make you a tea. Why do stumbling people need tea? Well, there are... equilibrium teas. Sorry, but unfortunately I have to be alone tonight, mon amour. Don't take it personally. I can take care of you. My wife is sick. But then you have to take care of your wife, no? Exactly, but she's asleep. And she loves sleeping. - I want to sleep, too, but not with you. No problem. I was longing for you. How nice. - We could do it like this... I could... We could do it like this... I... I could lie next to you and you could watch me slowly jerk off. Let's not talk about it. Why not? No one can hear us. Listen, I could eat out your little honey pot again. Balti, you're very sweet, but it was a bad day full of Holocaust and Mercedes-Benz and terrible things. You want me to feel really bad right now? GERMAN HIGH SCHOOL IN RIGA Can I really leave you alone here? I'll be better tomorrow. What was that? - What? I heard something. - It was nothing. NOW YOU CAN JERK OFF Dear? - Yes? How did you know that? - What? That I wanted to jerk off? - Oh, sweetie... We're so close. Get undressed. What's this book, Toto? Why do you come home in the morning, bleeding, with this tooth, this book... Gandhi has a concussion. Honey, I can stop if you want. I can stop if it hurts you so much. Honey. Just stick to the schedule and we'll be fine. It's all very well, but I won't do it. I understand you, but... then the whole very important project will be at risk. My commitment was tied to Manfred. Well, I can... We can assure you... that this Congress will bring together the world's most renowned historians. Look who's coming. All of my pain is recorded up here. I'll die soon, but maybe pain should be remembered. That's why I share my memories with people who know what pain is. We do know that. We're paid for that, among other things. - No. Nobody's paid for pain. Maybe for the management of pain. The SS guards at Auschwitz were paid for the management of pain, too. You're not comparing our institution with a concentration camp? I'm not interested in institutions. There are no good institutions! I'd say our institution is really good. There are no good institutions. And working for a good institution doesn't make you a good person. I'm only interested in poor bastards. Manfred was a poor bastard. He sure was... - I won't talk to you anymore. You would've been a good Gestapo man. Fine. Can't you at least give a lecture? Not be a patron, just a lecture? This Congress was a great labor of love, especially for Manfred. Do you know Kasimir Zweiselstein? Kasimir...? - Yes, Kasimir Zweiselstein. The 1929 Yearbook! Riga's German High School! That was in your apartment with a post-it on page 165. Colonel Blumen was a well-known NS-perpetrator. - I know him very well. I grew up with him. You're not entitled to collect material about my grandfather without my consent. How dare you. I wanted to tell you. When? Soon. - Soon? Were you going to tell me 'soon' that you called my brother? This is his number. Ask your brother. I didn't call him. - No, I can't. He won't talk to me. I wrote a book about my grandfather. - A great book. "10,000 Murders." - Great title. The great title that made my family turn their back on me. I'm scum to them. Dog shit. I've known you for a long time. Much longer than you think. Please sit down. Please. Sit down. Thanks. You of all people I reveal intimacies to... - But I'll never tell. Not even Balti. My middle name is Zip Up. - No, it's Gutter Whore. No, it's Rosencranz. Excuse me? Page 166. Rebecca Rosencranz. My grandma. Your grandfather. My grandma. In the same class? Come any closer and you'll get hurt! I... I mean it. You know who was in charge of the gas vans in Riga? I know. Why are you here then? To get to know you. You want to live here for a year with your lover to get to know me? And your grandfather. All Jews from his school were killed by him. And that Grandma was in his class... I knew that from this book. Why didn't you say anything? Because, if I'd said, "Your grandpa might've killed my grandma," what a great door-opener that would have been! It's not that my grandfathermight have killed your grandma. He definitely killed her. Too bad Grandma didn't know any Jiujitsu. Your banality disgusts me. You shouldn't have come here. - Talk to me. Hey, lovebirds. Special meeting. In ten minutes in the boss' office! - Talk to me. Please. Just go. Just go, really. Go away. Well, I want to say it loud and clear for everyone. The entire Auschwitz Congress is at risk. Tara Rubinstein is revoking her patronage. May I ask what you did to the lady? - I didn't do anything to her. She has no idea what they did to Jews in Auschwitz. Did you say that? He didn't mean it like that. What did he mean? - He meant he didn't want to talk about her nose. What else can you talk about with an actress? That was Manfred's last wish: this Congress with Tara Rubinstein. That was his scientific legacy. And that's our duty. Oh yeah? I don't see his jasmine tea. I don't even see his jasmine tea cup! Your sarcasm is really pathetic. You interviewed Kasimir Zweiselstein four years ago. - So? Rubinstein knows him from Auschwitz. She'll only participate if he does. We've informed him. He lives in Vienna. You're flying over. Are you sure? - He knows you. Ms. Lindeau will accompany you. - No, she won't. Then you accompany Ms. Lindeau. She's got the job. Excuse me? - An intern? - In theory, I could... Her face isn't mangled like yours and you can't go alone. - You're nuts. I'm happy to repeat Manfred's words in front of everyone here. I won't let your personal and psychological problems disrupt our operational processes. You're wacko. - The Auschwitz Congress will take place. Maybe, but I'm out. Whether or not it's wise to give an employee you have sex with this kind of responsibility is your call. Want him to fire you? - Stay away. It's my fault. I'll tell him everything. - Stay away! I'm only here for you! - Get lost! Only for you! But we need to talk! - Not at all. We... - You have nothing to do with my life! You're part of my life! - Go back to frog-eating country! Bye! Part of my shitty life! What the hell? We need to talk. - Stop, stop, stop... There's paint thinner in that. Do you want to go blind or what? We need to talk. - Don't... About your grandparents. - OK. Wait, don't open your eyes. - I can't see. No, I'll bring you home. - We have to talk! OK, we'll talk! You've come well prepared. We wanted to talk. - Let's forget about work. Ms. Lindeau, you wanted... - No, no. Zazie. Call me Zazie. Well, Zazie, you wanted to talk about our grandparents. And are our grandparents work? I think they're personal. - Both. We'll talk about them all evening, but I want us to be honest, absolutely honest. That's the only way our souls can touch. You got the paint off pretty well. Balti doused me with acid. What a lady's man! He'll leave you alone. But we need to go to Vienna. Honestly? - Yes. Honestly. Can I be totally honest with you? I'm prepared for anything. Well, it irritates me that... Don't get me wrong, but I have certain visions of you. I mean, physical visions. It's psychologically understandable... but it's embarrassing. - Shall we order? Do you have them, too? - Excuse me! You know what I mean? These physical visions, also erotic ones. You're asking if it turns me on that my grandfather killed your grandmother? I didn't say that. You get aggressive so fast. Unbelievable. Here. There you go. You're welcome. Shall we get some sake? - No, water, please. Water, OK. - You want to drink water because I get weird urges from my subconscious? I just want water. I'm in a restaurant and I want water. Is it wrong to do that here? I think you don't want water at all! You totally want sake! But something in your head forces you to drink water, because you're afraid you'll end up in bed with me because of the sake. But maybe you'll end up in bed with me even if you drink water, so let's drink beer. Sorry, I can come back... No, I'll have a beer, please. Two. - Two beers, sure. Thanks. It's very important for us to have the same drink. Good grief. - You know the theory about the children of perpetrators and victims? Maréechal. Many children of victims want to sleep with the children of perpetrators to subconsciously force a reconciliation with their own superego. I'm trying to take you seriously, Zazie, but I need us to talk about our grandparents. Why can't we talk about us? - You want to talk about sex. We're Holocaust researchers. - So? Holocaust researchers only talk about the Holocaust? Holocaust researchers can talk about sex and sex researchers about the Holocaust. We're people. People kill people, people love people. You ridicule everything. I'm an extremely severely traumatized personality. I'm extremely disturbed. Maybe you can't tell, but yes, the fate of my family has shaped my character. I don't understand why I wake up and see you naked at night. It worries me a lot, and I think I must be a pervert. And if it's not that way for you, if you never see me naked, I'll think of myself as being even more perverse! Here we are. Two beers, "Bavarian Gold." Take it away. I can't drink beer. - But sorry, you ordered beer, right? But you didn't say it was a German beer. I don't drink beer from the country of murderers and assholes! Great, great... We also have Chinese beer or... No, we'll have sake. I'll have water, please! Sake and water. I also have physical visions. Really? - Yes. You're not just saying that so I'll stop crying? No, I... I also see you... Naked? - Yes. That comforts me. Finally, a completely normal reaction from you. Well, I'm not sure... Show me pictures of your grandfather. Pictures? I forgot them. Shit. Why!? - Stop here. Then fuck you, slut! - What? Psychotic bitch, really. Man! A visitor. Who's that? Toto, who's she? The woman with the paint? Yes, Zazie Lindeau, my intern. We were looking at pictures. I see. Pictures. Mass murder in Latvia? Just what my daughter needs at 2:30 a.m. It's about our past. - Sarah, off to bed. Past? Our past? Our past, hers and mine. - You have a past? Well, a prenatal one, yes. Prenatal, ah, a prenatal past. Can't you stop with this trauma shit? Can't you try to live in the present? Just try? I'm so absolutely sick of it. The past is just shit. Mom, you don't put your underpants on the table. Go to bed, honey. Goodbye. Great to meet you. 8:00 a.m. at the airport. See you tomorrow. THE BUTCHER OF PRAGUE THE BUTCHER OF LUBLIN THE BUTCHER OF BUTCHERS Don't you read anything else? - Like what? Something other than butchers. Yes, about those who were butchered. - You only read academic books? You don't? - No. There are such beautiful things to read. Anne Frank's diary is quite beautiful, for example. "The Empress of Kalumina." What's that? Poems? German poems? Are you nuts? No. The Empress of Kalumina had blond hair Her soldiers, they knew not how they'd fare The Empress of Kalumina had eyes of green And all who saw her rule marched for her regime The Empress of Kalumina had a heart so red Many a soldier ended up burnt dead But one day... ...the Black Prince came to take her hand And then he took from her her hair, her heart, her land Can I get out? We're from the "Central Office" in Ludwigsburg. We're here to see Mr. Zweiselstein. Terrible! Hey, my little pony. Are you at Zweiselstein's? No, we haven't seen him yet.- What a pity. Why not? - He's not doing great. Sorry? What did you say? I said he's not doing so great.- Damn. What's wrong with him? He probably has a headache. A headache. Poor guy. We'll do it tomorrow. I promise, darling.- At the latest. I miss you. I miss you too. Are you nuts? Why didn't you tell him the truth? I always tell the truth, just not immediately. Zweiselstein is dead. - Yeah, OK, and I'm very sad, too. But we have to go back. We have nothing to do. Our flight leaves the day after tomorrow. Would it be so bad to stay? - And do what? Well, there are two great Jewish Museums, a resistance exhibition and a documentation center on euthanasia. - Are you kidding? What? You turn negative so fast. I'm a Holocaust researcher, I make a living by being negative. What gives me the goddamn right to be positive? Me. A pug came into the kitchen And stole an egg from the cook Then the cook took a spoon And beat the pug to pulp It's OK, no, wait... Then came many pugs And dug it a grave And set it a gravestone On which stood written... Come on, join me. You know it? Heads up! Watch out! Fantastic. Take a picture. - Yeah! Get in position. Like this? - Move closer to them. Thanks! Quick! Throw it down. What? Terrible. - Yeah? Want to see? - Definitely not. Don't move. Waffenschwein . Waffenschwein ? You wish each other good luck before a mensur . What's a mensur ? Where you fuck someone up with one of those. And why do you know all that shit? Everyone in my family was in a student corps. "Rigensia." En garde. Ready? Fence. Don't you think you should stop the flirting? I'm not flirting. Oh yeah? Then why make a fuss of yourself with that thing? You wanted to know what a mensur is. Yeah, but I say garbage, then you say garbage, that's how it is. You think so? Goggelmoggel ? Did you eat goggelmoggel too? - Oh that, sure. And vodka? Vodka... And you always had passcha at Easter? - Sure. Russian stuff like that, yes. See? We just say garbage. It's pretty sad that so much connects us. It is a bit sad, indeed. I don't know anything about flirting. Then we'll fly tomorrow after you've slept and dreamt and talked on the phone with your wife. I can't kiss. I know. I have AIDS. What? AIDS? - Yes, I have AIDS. I mean, sure, there are drugs and stuff... but that's it. You can imagine. - I have AIDS, too. Really? God, I'm sorry. But it's great that you can still ride a bike like that with AIDS... and fight... Shit, I don't have AIDS. I don't either. What's wrong? You can tell me anything. I'm impotent. No shit? I understand. What? With your wife and little Sarah. Oh, no, no... I... I wasn't always impotent. I used to be quite different. I don't know what happened. When I couldn't do it anymore, I pushed Hannah to have sex with other men. That's very nice of you. Well, yeah... I help her to choose them. There are these agencies... I make sure they're all brawn and no brains, so she won't fall in love. You really like her. But... I can't do it anymore. I can't. I can't do it anymore. And Hannah thinks I need a new job. You need a new life. Yes, that's the same thing. And why can't you kiss if you're impotent? Maybe your grandpa and my grandma lay together like this, too. Did you know him well? Yes, I knew him. What was he like? Kind. Shit. Come here. Come out. Can you hear me? Don't go. Don't go. You hear me? Here you are. There must be a reason. You don't just do it. You do? Have you done it before? Five times? I told you: extremely disturbed. If you try to kill yourself five times, there must be a reason why it doesn't work. Eventually it will. Grandma saw our kiss. And she saw that I liked it. We're bonkers. I've had sex almost exclusively with Germans. Though they're a disaster in bed. Tell me about it. I don't mean you. I'm sure we could have great sex. I'm meshuga. I'm just a meshuga Jewish girl. And I absolutely love riding in a Mercedes. They're great cars. During my... third suicide attempt, I... I crashed my boyfriend's Mercedes into a tree. Great airbags. Does Thomas know? He knows my body. He knows it well. I've loved you for three years now. Since Manfred told me about you. I love your story because it's my story. We have to make a trip. We're on a trip. Nonsense. We need to go to Riga. You alright? Hey, asshole! GERMAN HIGH SCHOOL, RIGA WEST Hello. Toto Blumen. Mrs. Blumen? Can we talk? I have a few questions. My name is Balthasar Thomas. Sieghart. Balthasar Thomas. I'm not Sieghart, Mrs. Blumen. I wanted to show you this. There. Sieghart. Who is this Sieghart? That's Riga. If that whole fucking century had never existed, our families would still live here. Like them there. Come here. No. Come. I can't sleep with you. I can't. Everything's fine. Sleep tight. Can I? I don't have any more pills. And there's no bathtub. Right. As your lawyer, I advise you not to give the matter too much importance. Mr. Thomas, these guys don't mess around. They don't. So be careful. Did you hear that? Something happened. Ovulation. What? Ovulation? Are you kidding me? - No, no. I'm sure I just ovulated. We'll have a little baby. What? You're pregnant? Are you serious? - Yes, I am. No way. I heard it too. Really. It'll be a girl. Kalumina. Our Empress Kalumina. Nice. I'll just say it outright: 5,000. Our sponsor, Mr. Mauersperger, doesn't mean it quite like that... Yes, sure I do. A 5,000-euro bonus for your conference presentation. You think my appearance is worth 5,000 euros? Sure, of course. It's worth infinitely more. This is about witnesses... If you wear a Mercedes star on the day, then a lot more. - Oh yeah? 10,000. And how much would the sponsor pay if it were a Jewish star? Right. That was really good. I never would've thought that an institute financed by taxpayers' money that explores the German genocide would be willing and also able to appeal to my Jewish business acumen, and with such sums! Oh, is it not enough or...? We should leave, Magda. Then state your price. Say it. It's no problem. Balti? - Bad timing. It's urgent. - You see what we're doing. I quit. Fine, could you come to my office in half an hour or so? I'm already here, so I'll just quit here. Fine. And whose ass is on poor Manfred's chair? Did I take someone's place...? I met someone. Why? - I fell in love. With Zazie. - The crazy one? I thought she was too stupid to add one plus one. Someone who pours paint on her head? - She's having my child. No one can have your child, Toto. - Why not? You're infertile. You're impotent. You hate people. I don't hate all people. - When did it happen? Yesterday. - No, how long has she been pregnant? Since yesterday. - So you had sex yesterday, is that it? I had sex and fertilized an egg. We heard it this morning. You heard it? You're all confused. You're shaken because you had an unexpected erection, honey. - No. We'll be fine. I had sex too, but I don't want to anymore. I want this baby. - Absurd. Why didn't we have a baby? Why the replacement child? Stop it. - What's a replacement child, Mommy? Sorry, sunshine. Go play inside, OK? Sorry. I didn't want you to feel bad because of me. You think I don't know what's going on? - It's over. I know you're screwing that guy. - I'll grow old with him. Fine. Just fine. Fine... It's fine. It's fine. I'll show you who you'll grow old with. - I know that already. No, you don't. You have no idea. What's this? What's it look like? Apartment liquidation. It's a valuable library. The guy was in debt. The house is being foreclosed. Want it? Back to work, guys, let's go. Come on, chop-chop! Hello. Sit down. Please. Thanks for your time. This is Zazie Lindeau. That's Sieghart Blumen. Know him? He's my brother. Are you in contact with him? Did you transfer the money? Yes, it's been done. We're not in contact. Why not? "In all the land, the biggest bitch is not the evil but the snitch." Can you tell us what your brother did before... before he was a snitch? Totila could smell Jews. Up to ten yards. Wait. Stop! - What kind of fucked-up... I'll leave my wife for you. I'm giving up my whole life for you and you run off with this fucking Nazi? Shut your mouth, shut up! I didn't hear you. Did you smell me? No, I stink a bit, I... It wasn't easy with Hannah. I'm glad we're leaving. What's going on here? They cleared out Manfred's whole house. Furniture, pictures, all down the drain. Yep, down the drain. Some pictures of Manfred and you from Yad Vashem are still there. We should take them and leave as quickly as possible. Prisoner number 4817. Ring a bell? Did you go to the prison? Did you call my brother? You should've told me everything. What did he say? Get lost. My brother's an evil asshole. What did he say? You're the asshole! I hate you! You're sick! Stop it! I didn't do anything. - You didn't do anything? That's what the SS said. "I didn't do anything." - I'm not a Nazi. Who are you, huh? Who are you? Zazie, I was very young. I loved my grandfather. I loved my brother. And you believe those you love. Who knows about it? - Nobody. Did you...? Did you hit anyone? Did you... blacks, gays... Jews? - I was the same as I am now. I got out when I was 17. - That late? What do you think it's like in a Nazi family? You think it's easy? All my life, I've been running after this shit. Reparation after reparation, and it just gets worse. Goddammit! I need you. You don't need me. We're connected because of all this. Goodbye. Please don't. Please don't. Balthasar will finish you. It'll cost you your job, your career, your whole life if this gets out. It's going to get out now. It's going to get out now. He wants to marry me. Then nothing will happen to you. Marry that idiot? He's already married. He's unhappy. I'll simply take him myself. It's bad for his wife, good for him, great for you and I don't care. You don't love him. - So? Who loves anyone? At least I love myself. You should learn that. And our baby? It could've turned out like this. He still looks sweet. Kind of sad and serious, but sweet. Souvenir. What'll happen to our baby if you marry Thomas? We won't have a baby, man, OK? That was romantique, oh làa làa. You really believe I heard my ovulation? How old are you? Please don't go. Please don't go. Please. Please stay. I still think you're a bombshell in bed. Have a nice life! Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'll now take the liberty to send the mentor and spiritus rector of this Congress, Professor Manfred Norkus, a few sentences out into the universe. He was the most gentle sheep I ever knew. I would've loved to be such a sheep. Because grazing is so much nicer than eating meat. Countless lovers, big cars, champagne, and yet just an insect in Auschwitz. I've spent my entire life searching for life. And now that I've found it, it doesn't seem enough. But what does it matter? Desire, longing, greed... As long as such things exist, hearts will beat. We live. If you want something, you have to go beyond yourself, out into the world, no matter how much it sucks. Unbelievable. Nice glasses. Thanks. Is that little Sarah? What? No, little Sarah was abducted by Martians. They put this alien here instead. I knew you when you were this big. That was three or four years ago... Five. - Five? That long? What are you doing here? Holocaust? No, Genocide Studies, I switched. But isn't that the same thing? No, it's genocide studies, it focuses on Canada, the USA, Indians and so on. They were exterminated, too. Great. Well, I'm just here to visit with ma chéerie and such. I switched teams. I'm with a woman now. - Really? An Indian woman. - Indian? Great body, doesn't speak a word of German. A big change. - Sounds good. And are you with Hannah? Yes, well, we're fine. Nice. And are you OK? You know... Sorry... - Oh yeah. Yes, it's all good. And... what's his name? Maurice. Maurice is his name. - Maurice? Hello. And how old? Three or four? - Yes, three, exactly. Sorry, but I have to go now. Palinka hates waiting, though Indians generally like to wait. Go figure. It was... great seeing you. Yes, it was. What a terrible woman. The poor girl. No, that wasn't a girl. It was a boy. Maurice. Bullshit. She called her... Kalumina or something.
