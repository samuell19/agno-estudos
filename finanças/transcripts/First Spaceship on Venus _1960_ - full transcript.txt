Postnikow as the Soviet Astronaut Kurt Rackelmann as the lndian Mathematician G?nther Simon as the German Pilot Tang Hua-Ta as the Chinese Linguist Lucina Winnicka as the TV Reporter many actors from different countries and Omega the Robot Executive Producers Hans Mahlich and Edward Zajicek Director Kurt Maetzig In 1970 an unusual rock was found at a construction site in the Gobi Desert. The specimen's strange appearance caught the attention of scientists. Tests revealed an interior vessel that contained a cylinder. Further analysis indicated the material was extraterrestrial in origin. It was not made by humankind. Where did it come from? Then they remembered that in Siberia in 1908 an explosion had occurred that was the size of a hydrogen bomb. It was visible from hundreds of kilometers away. It was thought to be a giant meteor. The flight path and impact location were later sought by Soviet expeditions but no remains were ever found of the Tongu meteor. Astronomers and astronauts led by the Soviet Prof. Arsenyev, the man who launched the first spaceship to the moon. Ieader of the lnternational World Federation for Space Research, gave the first thorough explanation to the world. According to our calculations confirmed by the Lunar Station's findings the mysterious Tongu meteor was likely the explosion of a spaceship from another planet. This hypothesis occupied scientists all over the world. In New York many are waiting for American atomic physicist Prof. Hawling. Prof. Hawling, isn't this another fairy tale? How could the cylinder have landed so far away from the location of the crash? How is it possible? We believe when the retro-rockets failed the spaceship's passengers tried to save what they considered most valuable. Their only option. I believe that this cylinder contains a magnetic recording of a document that was composed in a language unknown to us. The world's largest computer was provided for an international translation commission to decipher this unknown language. This is the Chinese linguist Chen Yu. His work in biology is as highly acclaimed as his contribution to linguistics. He succeeded in transforming inorganic substances into food. Now feeding a growing world population is no longer a problem. He is leading the translation commission together with Prof. Sikarna, a world-famous mathematician with the genius of Einstein. We don't yet have the translation commission's results, but our experiments in astronomical research continue. There is no doubt. This spaceship was launched within our solar system, from a position inside Earth's orbit. Given that no life can exist on Mercury, it could only have been launched from one location: Our morning and evening star, the planet Venus. Now! -Our Earth's elements. -Correct. It's certainly a chemical physical analysis of the Earth's surface. -But Professor... -Shhh! These are the first words of beings from another planet! Yes. But unfortunately, the cylinder containing the message was damaged. Probably a result of high temperatures endured during the crash. We don't know the content of the message sent by the Venusians. Using chemical and radioactive treatments we'll try to recover the missing text. -Chen Yu... -Yes, we don't know much. But what we do know is that Venus is inhabited by highly-developed beings. My concern is, Why is Venus silent? Now we understand their language but can we communicate with them? We have to try... I propose, we approach all governments with the request that they aim all radio and radar transmissions toward Venus. We'll call Venus! Polar station calling Lunar Station Luna 3. This is Lunar Station Luna 3. Venus is still silent. Our signals are reaching the planet but there is no response. Good afternoon. -May I request an interview? -We have great news. As you know, we're building the largest spaceship ever made, the Cosmokrator l. It was intended for flight to Mars. Our government will offer it to the lnternational Space Research Federation. It will fly to Venus. -ls it ready for launch? -Should flight be attempted? -What do our rocket scientists say? -Has Venus answered yet? No, Venus is still silent. Regardless, we're flying. Who is flying? Here are some members of the team who are preparing for takeoff. They'll make up the largest collective of the best astrophysicists and astronauts. They are the Cosmokrator's crew. Why not just a team of Soviet scientists? It's their rocket! Landing on Venus cannot concern only one nation. We are not only internationalists in politics. In a peaceful world we don't keep our successes to ourselves. Take Luna 3 for example, the socialist lunar station. We don't use it as a military base. Engineers and physicists from all nations work there. Has Hawling responded to your invitation yet? We haven't yet heard from our great American colleague and friend, Hawling. But we're certain he'll reply. Hawling, your stubbornness is exhausting! Be reasonable and forget about this flight! I appeal to the consortium to accept that nothing will deter me! I belong in that team! They are more interested in our rocket than in you. At this pace we'll have our own rocket in no time. But by then it will be too late. We're just getting older, George! Too bad we'll be delayed. Arsenyev was faster. Which is why it's an even greater travesty to delay. The delay is not my fault. I've been working 20 years for you since our atomic bomb test in the Pacific. Have a whisky, Hawling. I've given you 20 years. Give me the chance to fulfill my dream. Two things have impressed me about you since day one: Your genius and your rationality. Now suddenly you're talking about dreams. You're allowing yourself to become involved in an ill-conceived adventure. Everyone has his adventure. Your adventure was... Hiroshima. His is the flight to Venus. Your adventures are behind you. His are yet to come. Dear Weimann, thank you for the lecture. It's a pleasure to become acquainted with your progressive convictions. But it would be better to allow the men here to talk business. Hawling is my student, my best student. He has learned more than physics from us. I could never do what I wanted. I wanted to work in G?ttingen as a German scholar. The Nazis drove me out of the university. I wanted to make useful atomic energy here in America. I built the atomic bomb. I never wanted it to be dropped. But they talked me into it. History doesn't have to repeat itself! Should no generation ever fulfill its dreams? I am tired. Excuse me. Hawling! We're weaker without you. But you're nothing without us. It won't end well. -All engines are functioning perfectly. -It's still too early to celebrate. We'll launch in two days at night fall. -Then we have a lot to do. -See you, Soltyk. Talua, check the radar device again. Will do, Professor. How's Mona? She telegraphed that she's flying in tomorrow. The pilot is bringing Hawling. Do you know Brinkmann? He's our German pilot on board. Survived three rocket explosions and he's still flying. I think you'll like him. This is lntervision. We have broadcast the tests of Cosmokrator's engines. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have won the grand prize. I will cover the launch of the spaceship to Venus. We know you'd all like to be here but unfortunately that's impossible. Only scientists and technicians involved with the launch are permitted. I will represent you as the only observer allowed here. Your participation is possible by watching these reports. At this moment, I see that the rest of the crew is arriving. Here's the man central to the operation: Polish chief engineer, Soltyk. What is it? I'll be there. -The tool supplies are complete. -Good. Station A reports that the stellar charts have been corrected. Afternoon, Soltyk! -The flight was excellent. -The rattle-trap still runs great. But show me your miraculous jet-propelled elasticopter. Everything's miraculous here. Omega, come here! Omega, what's the weather forecast for the next 6 hours? Barometer falling 4 points. Fantastic! Your invention of course? Oh, nothing special. -My 20th son. -Don't be so modest. What else can he do? He automatically takes measurements and analyzes them. Omega's latest improvement is electronic memory. Wonderful. Maybe we could pass the time playing chess with him. Back from America? Hop in. To the meadow. A little bit too crazy for just two days. Some people don't understand what it means that I'm joining you, that it isn't just for science. They don't get it. This is it. I was here yesterday too. Thanks. You can drive back. Do you like it here? Beautiful view, isn't it? You'll never guess what I want to do, Hawling. I want to sit down on the earth, literally. The smell of grass! What do you think: Is there grass on Venus? -My son asks questions like that. -Yours too? I am supposed to give his drawing to you. A house, garden, and a rocket in front. You and I are inside it. The star we're flying to shines above. The world is perfect in his eyes. He likes drawing rockets and stars. You have to visit us, Arsenyev, as soon as we return. Yes, Hawling, if we return. Venus is still silent. And this strange cylinder offers us nothing more than we already know. Just words without meaning. Do you really think it contains something that would delay the launch? I'm not clairvoyant. Let's go. The Cosmokrator's crew is now complete. Eight volunteers, each an undisputed expert. Seven men and... one brave woman, who practiced medicine for two years at the Lunar Station. Sumiko! Brinkmann? Have I changed much? I don't know... Maybe you wore your hair down then. -Dr. Brinkmann? -Yes? -Your suitcase! -Oh, thanks! Raimund Brinkmann, who's known not only for his forgetfulness. I misplace things but I have forgotten nothing even after all these years. No, Brinkmann. There's no room for extra baggage on a journey like this one. The evening is approaching. Two nights and one day until launch. We must sign off. We won't be able to see or interview Cosmokrator's passengers for a while. For 50 hours they will be in a deep, artificially-induced sleep which will help them adjust to this difficult journey into space. Signing off. Goodbye. Brinkmann, in two minutes you will sleep, whether you like it or not. You can see and hear your heartbeat. I'm glad you're coming with us, Sumiko. Now I'll always be near you. Your heartbeat is normal. Sumiko... -my heart beats... -Brinkmann, no! Please Raimund, never mention it again. Good night, Raimund. -You must sleep now too, Dr. Ogimura. -Yes, you're right. This is lntervision calling the world. In a few moments Cosmokrator's crew will arrive. These are the final minutes before takeoff to Venus. Tension is mounting among the scientists and technicians here on the base. And now, here comes the crew. These are the astronauts. Professor Sikarna, please, a few words for our viewers. Get down! We've done what was necessary. We're ready, and that's it. Next is Professor Hawling from America. Today is an important day in the history of science. Greetings to all my friends wherever they may be, especially my old teacher, Weimann. I'm happy to be part of this expedition, for humankind and for my country. The interviews have begun. I'm standing in front of the radar vehicle. -Radio control, no word from the charter? -We'll find out. -Dr. Sumiko Ogimura. -Please, a few words from you too. My husband was a radiologist and astrophysicist. He died installing the solar reflector when we were stationed at Luna 3. I am continuing his work. I have chosen this profession because I was born after WWll ended in Japan. And because my mother was killed by the Hiroshima bomb. This era didn't begin well. But I believe we'll improve things. Please, a few words for our viewers, Dr. Chen Yu. We will encounter life forms we have never seen. A great moment in our endeavors to understand nature. This is the beginning of a new science. Human knowledge will surpass the heavens. Thank you. Greetings to all! Goodbye. -Please, Professor. -Star reporter Jeanne Moreau interviews... We have our calculations. We trust them, although no one knows the dangers. We thank all those who have helped prepare for this flight. We're certain we will return within four months. Soltyk, please. Our technical equipment is perfect, the robots are functioning without error. Mitya will begin college in 6 years. I always imagined he'd study physics. But let him decide for himself. Technical skills often emerge as late as mid-career. Be patient with him. Promise me that. Mother, why did you travel all this way? I'll return soon. My boy, be careful. -Sumiko, just a moment please. -Goodbye and good luck! This is my mother. Take care, son. Mona dear, can you hear me? We're taking off and you're not here. Forgive me, radio listeners but I must speak to you, Mona. Don't worry, we have the best technology. My Mona, do you hear me? Don't cry. Say hello to my father. Our spaceship is launching. I'm so happy that I'm flying to the stars. Now the African crew member is boarding. Time synchronization: 51, 52... ...60. Thank you. Clear for takeoff. Breathe calmly. Relax. Don't tense up. -lgnition system engaged. -Ten seconds to lift-off. Nine seconds... -Stand by. -Three seconds... Zero! Luna 3 to Urania. Cosmokrator is showing on our radar. How do you feel? Like I'm in heaven. We left heaven behind at cosmic speed. I have to ease this pressure on my chest. Careful, we're still weightless. Keep your seatbelt fastened. Soltyk, you can switch to ionic drive. Hawling, careful. I'm switching to artificial gravity. I can't help it. This is Luna 3. Come in Cosmokrator. Hello Luna 3. We read you loud and clear. Minus two. Plus five. Course normal. -The hyperbolic trajectory is precise. -Passing the moon at 2,000 km. That's the Sinus Roris crater. And that's our station, Luna 3. That's the solar reflector. They're signaling us. Her husband was killed there. I brought him back to the camp. But he was already dead. We were friends. Sumiko is a wonderful woman. You should know everyone respects your grief. Many tears were shed when Ogimura perished on that mountain. Every woman interested in science, -all in China are- are pleased that you're continuing his work and flying with us. I know, Chen Yu. You want to console me. You mean well. But who knows about me in China? Believe me, your picture is everywhere even in my daughter's room. She's studying astromedicine and knows about your work at the Lunar Station. Everyone knows you're the most distinguished. This is Luna 3. We've discovered a cloud of meteorites. Its position has shifted with intense speed. We're receiving you. Over. Coordinates of trajectory are: Alpha X, 17 degrees, 2 minutes, Beta Y, 84, 32 minutes. Hello, Captain. Luna 3 has warned us that meteorites are approaching. Prof. Sikarna, we have the latest meteorite report for you. We'll reach the meteorite cloud in 48 hours unless its trajectory changes. Remain in constant contact with Luna 3. Cosmokrator to Luna 3. Requesting update on our course. Today I am beginning a personal log book. Cosmokrator's center is often vacant. The predictor not only keeps the ship on course, but can adjust direction and speed if irregularities occur. For the next 30 days auto-pilot will take over navigation because no human could control the ship's complicated mechanisms. Thus far, we have traveled over 4 million kilometers. Liquid food, which is easily ingested during weightlessness is thoroughly enjoyed by all. Dr. Ogimura strictly monitors the diet and health of all crew members. Engineer Soltyk is usually in his workshop. His robots require precise maintenance. His robots help eliminate the hard, physical work on Earth. The Polish cybernetician has to be everywhere. He is Arsenyev's right hand. Prof. Sikarna is still working on the message from Venus. He and Chen Yu want to decipher the magnetic cylinder. They lock themselves up with Marax and work for hours on end. The computer runs continually but no one knows what the outcome will be. Captain Arsenyev makes sure we're still on course. The predictor accelerated the jets for 17 seconds last night. Probably to avoid meteorites. But we don't expect them until tomorrow. Your robots are more cautious than we are. Prof. Hawling practices his hobby in his free time. He has beaten all of us but found a master in Omega. King G 8. King E 6. Unbelievable. He plays an impenetrable endgame. I thought I had the guy beat but his king to E6 has forced me into the corner to H 8. King to F 7. Checkmate. Next move. Congratulations. This is the tenth match I have lost. And lost badly. Your brilliantly constructed Omega is missing something. What do you mean? If he had a soul, he would have let Hawling win once too. Think about it, okay? Just a tiny bit of soul. Meteorites! Pull out the acceleration fuse! Brinkmann! Check on Chen Yu and Sikarna! How could this happen? I thought the Cosmokrator automatically avoids meteor clouds. Yes, but the accelerator couldn't go fast enough because we had the fuse set at 8 g. We had to pull it out first. Hawling, how far off course? Twelve degrees, 17 minutes. -Speed? -Constant. 44 per second. The main cloud can't be far. We're heading straight for it at maximum speed. Auto-pilot. Power down. I'm decelerating. The engines aren't engaging. What's wrong, Soltyk? Meteor fragments have damaged thrust propeller 3. It must be repaired externally. Now it's my turn. -When will the main cloud appear? -At any moment. Brinkmann, help me! Prof. Sikarna, Chen Yu! Are you alright? We're fine. Please, we need details on our course, the coordinates and corrections. Sit down and fasten your seatbelts. The main cloud is in view. The engines could engage any moment. Repairs complete. Soltyk is back! Cosmokrator to Luna 3. Meteorite cloud encountered. All is well on board. It's been 3 weeks since takeoff. Despite our incredible speed the stars seem to stand still. In ten days we will reach Venus. But it is emitting powerful disturbances. Contact with Earth has nearly ceased. Nothing. I can't get through. Too much disturbance. Alpha X, 32 degrees, 8 minutes... Beta Y... But life aboard the Cosmokrator goes on as usual. What are you making? A little bit of soul for Omega. Those ten lost games really got to Hawling. He should enjoy playing chess again. You could also make me happy, Engineer Soltyk. I always have to chase you with your meals. It won't happen again. That's what Sikarna always says too. Professor. What is it? Not important right now. I am responsible for your health. You haven't eaten in days. I don't have time. Please! Sumiko! Leave him alone. He's nervous. Soon you'll understand why. Knight to E 6. Check! I don't get it. King E 8. Checkmate. Congratulations, Hawling. A well-deserved victory. A clear, consistent endgame. Bravo, Hawling. Your first win. Playing against your child prodigy wasn't so easy. But the human spirit conquers the machine. I'm happy for you, my friend. Your turn. Everyone report to Marax. The cosmic message. Please. We have deciphered that small portion of the cylinder that was unreadable. I'll translate: "After the second reversal of elements the planet's radiation will commence." "The planet's leading species can be eliminated easily." "When the ionization's intensity falls 50% the great movement will begin." That means... an attack on our Earth. An invasion by the Venusians. The cosmic report was not a message to humans. It was a blueprint for aggression. We must contact Earth immediately. Wait! Let him go. Are we helping Earth if they know what we know? Earth is in danger. We must warn them. No! Earth has been in peril over 50 years but nothing has happened. We don't know how Venusians calculate time or how long they live. If people knew of the danger, unrest and hysteria would break out. Their fear could wipe everything out. Massive panic would spread across the globe. No, Hawling. You're mistaken. How many years has humanity faced atomic death? And humanity has conquered it. Everyone has known all along what the threat has been. No. There will be no panic. What do you think? I'm certain we'll make contact with the Venusians. And if they're planning war we should be able to make peace with them. Talua, contact Earth. I can't get through Venus' disturbance. Our transmissions are absorbed. Earth can't hear us. Does anyone think we should turn back? No. Oh, nonsense. Turn back now? No. Never. No. Soltyk, speed! We're flying 50 thousand an hour. We'll reach Venus in 3 days. Talua, check our course. Hawling, the latest readings. Gamma rays are increasing logarithmically. But I'll recheck the readings. -Please. -Alright. -Nerves? -Not nerves. What then? When I heard you were coming I was very happy. Now I wish you weren't here. Why, Brinkmann? I'm a scientist and researcher just the same as you. You're also a woman. I brought Ogimura back from the lunar mountains, dead. I'm worried I'll have to bring you back from somewhere, too. Your role is to preserve life, to bring a child into the world. That is what's on my mind. I never told you how I got to know Ogimura. He was examining my radiation exposure that also killed my mother. I will never be able to have a baby, he told me. It would be deformed. A monster. Everything was decided for me by the Hiroshima bomb. Three thousand kilometers. On our 31st day we've nearly reached our destination. Every attempt to contact Luna 3 has been unsuccessful. The atomic engines have slowed our speed. Prof. Arsenyev pilots the ship into an elliptical orbit around Venus. We're a satellite of the silent star. We've been trying in vain for hours to make radio contact with the Venusians. A thick blanket of clouds surrounds the planet. 2,500 kilometers. The first analysis of Venus' atmosphere: 26% carbon dioxide. 14%ormaldehyde. No oxygen. Highly toxic. We have an important decision to make. We can land and take off only once. If unprepared, we could die. Therefore, one of us has to go out first. In such poor visibility I'll fly the jet-propelled elasticopter. You'll need to locate our landing surface. At 10km altitude we'll await your report. -Ready for launch. -1,500 kilometers. -Well... -No farewells. Stations, everyone. Exactly 1,000 kilometers. Attention! We're now entering Venus' atmosphere. This is central command. We're flying at an altitude of 20 km at a speed of 1.5 km per second. Ready for takeoff? Ready for takeoff. Stay clear. and... blast off! Brinkmann! Hello, Brinkmann! Hello! What's wrong with your radio? I'm not reading you. Your radio is malfunctioning! I can't understand you. Your radio isn't working. -Talua, what's wrong with the transmitter? -Atmospheric disturbance. We're cut off. Arsenyev, can you hear me? I'm descending below 800 meters. Still no visibility. On radar the area looks mountainous. I see land, Arsenyev. I see something. I don't know what it is. Looks like a glass forest. Cosmokrator! I cannot hear you anymore! I'm preparing for landing. We've lost all contact with Brinkmann. Altitude? 1200 meters. Omega, forward. I don't get it. At this short distance the radar waves should penetrate even the thickest clouds. But for over an hour now there's this peculiar lightning. There is only one explanation: the atmosphere has been ionized. -But from what? -Atomic radiation. That means they're attacking us. And Brinkmann? I have to descend lower. We must break through the cloud cover if we want to find Brinkmann. We must! Please come in, Cosmokrator, come in. -Omega. -I hear you. Here danger. Go Omega. Keep going. Radioactivity. Eight Curie. When dangerous? After eight minutes. Omega, come back! Cosmokrator. I can't hear you. Hello! Do you read me? This damned radioactive forest won't let radio waves through. Go Omega. Faster! Damn, they're attacking us. Cosmokrator, do you read me? Our copter is gone. A glow of fire, like a flare! The predictor indicates a shock wave, probably from an explosion. Distance: 200 kilometers. Brinkmann! Or a signal from the Venusians. We are going to have to make an impromptu landing. Talua, use the sonar locator. Try to make contact with Brinkmann. Omega, come back! -Retro-rockets. -Thrust! 18, 21, 24... The fuel exploded. Poor Brinkmann. This was the cause: a power cable. Soltyk, move the caterpillar in case the voltage surges again. Omega! -What luck! And we thought... -Yes, I was lucky. You sure did choose a lousy place to land. -Why? -A power cable. Brinkmann, your copter was downed by an induction current. This underground power cable must lead to the Venusians. You won't need to look far. I found them already. I've got some of them. What do you think? I wonder if it is a life form. It must be examined, immediately! Yes, Chen Yu. Hawling, we'll follow the power cable with the caterpillar. Omega, come. Turtle, come in. We followed the cable. There is something peculiar here. A white sphere. Wonder what it is? Is it life or a machine, Hawling? Can't say. No idea. Everything is so strange here. It's as if... ...we tried to read a book in a foreign language. It'll take days. Maybe then we'll understand. As soon as the instruments can be read I'll need all the figures I can get. Okay, Professor. -Talua, call the Venusians. -ln all frequencies. With a TV camera through the tip of the ship, I observe Venus. Is this the calm before the storm? Why aren't the Venusians answering? Are these metallic insects truly the rulers of this planet? Chen Yu is working intensively to solve the mystery of these creatures. We have thoroughly investigated your Venusians. -They're not dangerous, not living beings. -I thought I found something important. You have no idea how important. Listen to one that we loaded into Marax. Those were Venusian voices that are trapped in crystals inside these metal insects. In other words, a tiny notation device for language and sound... ...that can be decoded. We'll give it a try. This cave Brinkmann fell into is an archive. A gigantic Venusian library. But where are they? Why are they hiding? Our landing must have attracted attention but they do nothing! My copter's explosion. Is that nothing? Bring me updated readings, numbers and material from this archive. Research continues according to plan. Of particular interest is the radioactive forest. The heavy protective suits make everything more difficult. The supply cables to the sphere are being investigated. All work is complicated by the storms on this planet. A boring Easter egg... Nothing's happening. I don't know... Chen Yu is examining the sand. Sometimes it's radioactive, sometimes clean. He is looking for signs of life. On Earth, pollen and seeds survive hundreds of centuries. Dusk and storms announce the night which lasts 16 days. The fieldwork must be interrupted. We evaluate the results of our expeditions. So you think the glass forest is a biological formation. Perhaps. A dried-out seabed. You're mistaken. It isn't a natural occurrence. Prof. Sikarna, with the computer's help, has calculated a probable scenario. I think the glass forest was an energy emitter for outer space. It could destroy all life within a radius of millions of kilometers. So are we dealing with a deed of the Venusians? Yes. This dangerous forest was the work of Venusian aggressors. This facility was somehow destroyed. Maybe Venus disarmed. Unfortunately, you're wrong. Those metal insects you brought me reveal something else entirely. You don't want to tell us? You're alluding to something, Sikarna. There still isn't a complete picture. But some kind of catastrophe must have happened on Venus. All tests amount to nothing and make no sense. Everything is fragmented, broken. If it was a catastrophe that changed everything so senselessly, then it must have been a disaster of unimaginable dimensions. We can only figure it out if we systematically continue our research. Here, the white sphere, where the various power cables originate seems to be a giant transformer. Something like a magnetic power plant. It's odd though, that there is sporadic voltage in the main power line. It's as if someone is sitting at the other end, and doesn't realize that the generator isn't working. But he still keeps trying to activate it. What should we do? We'll explore the main line and follow it to the other end. Reporting to Cosmokrator. We've been driving several hours. We're following the power cable. No sign of the Venusians. The cable has to end somewhere. Arsenyev, should we keep going? We're trying to pave the way. Follow us with caution. Arsenyev, what is that? My first impression is that nothing here is organic. These were buildings. The temperature here must have been as hot as the sun's. An unimaginable catastrophe must have wiped out every form of life. What are you thinking about, Sumiko? Hiroshima. And I worked for that. Twenty years. Here it is. The power cable continues here. We'll have to go inside. This is probably the entrance. Omega, come. Let's go inside. Venus and Earth in their orbits? Maybe it's a model for instructing space pilots. This instruction had a graver purpose. Come here, a shaft. This was probably the Venusian's headquarters. -Who could have used these switches? -And where is the energy source? This entire facility still carries voltage. Omega! What is that? I don't know. -What could it be? -Maybe a life form. An animal? It looks like the sludge contains life. Omega, stop! The mass is growing! Go faster. It's coming out of the crevices! Come on! Hold on! Come on, Sumiko! Don't be afraid, Sumiko. We'll find a way out. Don't shoot! Soltyk! What's going on? Where are the others? I don't see them. Do you know what that is? That is a targeting device intended to destroy our planet. Remember the cosmic report? After the second rotation the planet's radiation will begin. From this point the lethal atomic rays were supposed to aim at our planet. It seems to be the nerve center where the energy source was controlled. Hello Professor, please come! The glass forest is radiating energy. Show me the sphere! Look! Gravity is increasing. That's what I expected. That's not possible. Yes it is. Now everything is clear. The sphere is creating a gravity field that changes Venus' force of attraction. Now the bow is being tightened, so to speak. If it's inverted, the force of attraction disappears and we'll be hurled into space. I wonder who put this huge facility into operation. Call Arsenyev, quickly! Arsenyev! Hawling! Come in! Their shadows. Projected onto the wall when the explosion surprised them all. The atomic explosion. The only thing left of their existence: their shadows. Marax translates all commands from the underground headquarters. Look at the decoders it utilizes. That's incredible! E=mc squared. That is Einstein's great formula. Yes, but as a circular process. It's closing to become a ring. Interesting. Elongated formations. How is that possible? Seeds? Where did you find them? In the top layer of the sediment. The wind probably carried them in just days ago. If these seeds are still fertile then life does exist on this planet. Prof. Sikarna requests crew to report to Marax. Examinations of the metal insects reveal a part of this planet's history. And the sounds from their headquarters leave no doubt: There were aggressors who planned an attack on Earth. But the attack wasn't carried out. The aggressors destroyed themselves. The lethal atomic power slipped from their hands, and a chain reaction ensued. They became the victims. Only their shadows remain. And their evil apparatus, which was partly destroyed but still functions. Especially if the energy source is triggered by a foreign hand. What? Are you saying that we activated it? When the stone fell into the mass what happened then? The mass flung it back out like an irritable animal. And then something terrible happened: it suddenly grew. Tell what happened next, exactly and in detail. -The mass got bigger? -Yes. We saw no way out. It chased us. And then? I deployed the neutron ray gun and shot into it. You shouldn't have done that. -lt is what started the atomic reaction. -But it saved us. The mass collapsed into itself and disappeared. In the underground headquarters the planetarium... ...or rather the targeting device, set the whole thing in motion. When? 17 hundred hours, 36 minutes. And from this moment on the sphere took on a red glow. Which means that the mass converted to energy. A process like the atomic bomb. But the Venusians could reverse it at will. They could convert mass into energy and energy into mass. -A circular process. -Fantastic. But how do you explain this sludgy mush? This mass can be transformed into energy. Electric, gravitational and the like. If we could convert all the energy of Earth's power plants into mass then there would be about 60 kilos of it. But Venus has an energy source with a mass beyond comprehension. These are only my assumptions. The Venusians are, or rather were, so much more advanced that we're facing an enigma. Stop, Omega! The radioactive energy is increasing! Brinkmann! Secure the other robot. Talua, come and help me. The glass forest... The radiation emitted from the glass forest have damaged Omega's electronic brain. The predictor won't work either. Look! The glass forest. If the radiation continues to rise the Cosmokrator's shield won't be able to protect us anymore. He has suffered internal injuries. I have to operate! Soltyk, start the engines. We must take off immediately! Impossible. The gravity field has us pinned. And the instrument panel... see for yourself! The Cosmokrator is a heap of useless tin. The only chance... We should be able to reverse the sphere and forest's lethal energy and to convert it back into mass. -But how? -I'm going back to the Venusian city. When you shot at the plasma stream, thereby changing mass to energy, I noticed a change in the nerve center at the bottom of the shaft. I know where and how the process advanced. Can the small rocket be used? Impossible. The gravity field. But our turtle can make it. You can't go alone. I'll go with you. We're entering the Venusian city. The storm is getting worse. How is Arsenyev doing? Sumiko is already operating. Sumiko will manage. Swab. Soltyk, can you do it? Yes, I've repaired everything. Chen Yu, answer! Where are you? We're beginning the descent to the nerve center. My spacesuit! I'll suffocate! I'm coming! Go down, Talua. The others' lives depend on us. Send help! Cosmokrator! I'm suffocating. -The sphere is white again. -But Chen Yu! Talua switched it over. But my suit is punctured. Do you read me? I can't seal it! Try! Gravity has normalized. I'll fly immediately with the small rocket. I'm coming to get you, Chen Yu. I'm bringing oxygen. Hold on! Brinkmann's coming! I must talk to him! Chen Yu, do you hear me? Your reagents, listen! They're germinating! Living cells! You were right. There is life on Venus. Yes, Sumiko. Life. The retro-rockets, Soltyk! Talua! Chen Yu! Brinkmann! You're in grave danger. Return at once! We can't keep the Cosmokrator down. The reversal has begun. The energy field is acting as a catapult. Retro-rockets on full power. Brinkmann, can you hear us? We're being hurled into space! Sumiko! Go back! Hawling, go back! Cosmokrator, where are you? Do you hear me? I can't fly back! I'm being pulled away! I can't hear you anymore! Cosmokrator, you're flying! You're flying... Greet the Earth and Mona. Arsenyev, can you hear me? Luna 3 to Urania. The Cosmokrator is approaching. We're not getting a response. I greet the Earth. I greet everyone. We have accomplished much. But we gave, and lost much too. So much. To Earth we announce the bequest of three great people. Talua saved our expedition. Chen Yu discovered life on Venus. And Brinkmann was the first to set foot on a foreign planet. Don't ever forget them, friends. Humanity should hear about the atomic destruction that occurred on another planet. A lethal threat from above imperiled our Earth. We witnessed what was intended for us, and how this attack ended. Two things must be done, for everyone: We must make sure our Earth continues to blossom. And then we should try to discover life on other planets. And we should do it soon. As soon as possible, friends. The End Translation and Subtitles by Betheny Moore Roberts (c) 2004. The DEFA Film Library at the University of Massachusetts Amherst
