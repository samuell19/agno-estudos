I'm gonna show you something. This thing starts circling the boat. Uso stands for unidentified submerged objects. Is that like a ufo that goes underwater? Bara: There are actually hundreds of documented cases of encounters in the bermuda triangle. Man: You've had tons of people missing. You've got boats missing, plane missing. This is a very eerie place. Dave: There's definitely something supernatural going on in the bermuda triangle. We need to figure out why people are disappearing. What the hell is that? Mike: I don't know if it's manmade or not, but just to find something like this is mysterious. The hair on the back of my neck is standing up. Looky here, looky here, look here. We don't really know what it is, but we know it's not natural. Diver one, come back to the surface. Diver one, I'm telling you, this is not really cool down here. Narrator: More planes, ships, and people disappear in the bermuda triangle than anywhere else on earth. Some blame nature's wrath. But others suspect a more sinister force. Chuck, you ready to get wet? Now four veteran bermuda triangle investigators will brave these treacherous waters in search of the truth. All right, we're over the mark. Let her go! There's something weird down there, brother. What is that? 15 feet. We're getting close. Four fearless men hell-bent on finally unlocking the secrets hidden beneath the most perilous waters on earth. captions paid for by discovery communications Dave: It's hot down there. I got pants on. I'm not really happy about this. Narrator: 4:00 p.M., the triangle research and investigation group, or trig team, is launching their latest investigation into one of the most perplexing phenomena reported inside the bermuda triangle, one that could be responsible for disappearances of boats, planes, and people throughout the deadly stretch of ocean. Dave: All right, moe. What do we got going on today? What do you guys know about usos? That's unidentified submerged objects. Is that like a ufo that goes underwater? Kind of. So why don't they just call it a ufo that's underwater? A uso is an unidentified submerged object. Some people believe they're from space. Some people believe they're from atlantis. And in the bermuda triangle, people see a whole lot of usos. I was down at the dock office, and the dock master happened to tell me about this guy, tony, who witnessed some sort of uso. Now, I don't know a lot of the details, but I did ask around about him, and everybody seemed to think that he was pretty reliable, so... At the least, it's a good start. It's a good start. Narrator: Unidentified submerged objects have been reported by thousands of witnesses in the triangle, with most describing glowing or metallic objects that are circular or oblong in shape. But far from being a mere curiosity, many experts believe usos are behind the disappearances that have made the bermuda triangle so notorious. 1971, a supersonic phantom ii air force jet flown by top gun pilot harry romero vanishes off the coast of florida. Additional phantom iis are scrambled to the area and spot a strange oblong object in the water where the jet disappeared. But by the time a nearby coast guard cutter arrives on scene, there is no sign of the object or the missing phantom ii. In 2016, veteran boat captain tony roberts witnessed a uso firsthand. - You must be tony. - Yeah. Captain moe. Nice to meet you. Narrator: The event took place at key biscayne, near the western tip of the bermuda triangle. It's an area that's home to dozens of shipwrecks dating back to the 1870s. We've heard you got some crazy story to tell us. Tony: Yeah, I do. So I was running a charter, you know, just doing a regular sunset sail. I was up in the tower, and all of a sudden, I feel the boat start listing to the port side. And I'm trying to figure out what's going on. I see everybody on the boat pushed over to the left kind of looking over. And I looked over the side, and I see there's a light. It's lit up. Okay. This thing starts circling the boat. How far away from the boat did it get? I would say 30 foot around. Around the boat. Like it was measuring, like, the area. And I'm looking down. These people are trying to see what's going on. And all of a sudden, it's gone. The light shuts off, and it's gone. Was this a biological movement? Maybe an animal? Or was it a mechanical movement? It's not like a fish swims. You know what I mean? It does... It's not making different moves. Circling your boat. Circling the boat. I'm gonna... I'm gonna show you something. - You have pictures? - Yeah, I have pictures. Why didn't we just start with that? Yes. Show us the pictures. All right. Oh, my. That is some kind of a light, isn't it? Look at that. How big is it? The whole thing could be as big as 6 to 10 feet. The whole thing, meaning the light? The light, and it had... If you look at it, it had what could be a tail. Chuck: The pictures that I was looking at, it had an extended tail. It wasn't anything that I recognized as biologic. It's also nothing that I would recognize as mechanical. I couldn't explain what it was. Tony: See? And it was, like, getting brighter and darker, brighter and darker. Well, look, we got pictures. You got coordinates? I do. I saved the coordinates because I thought it was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen. Moe: Go ahead and read it off to me here. All right. 24-68... Dave: Hearing the description of tony's uso incident, I don't think it could have been a fish. I don't think it could have been a submarine. Could be the military doing dive excursions. It could be an underwater drone. Good luck, guys. Yeah, right on. Dave: Other explanations are what everybody's afraid of, that there is a higher being up there checking us out. We're not always the top of the food chain. Narrator: The first recorded uso sighting in the bermuda triangle was made by christopher columbus, who reported strange lights in the water on his journey to the new world. But some encounters have been far more menacing. March 2000, the greek cargo ship leader I is passing near bermuda when it is struck by an unidentified object later described by crew members as metallic in appearance. The impact is so severe that the 770-foot-long ship sinks in less than 60 seconds, and nearly half the 31-man crew goes missing in the still-unexplained incidents. Chuck: I'll jump in the boat. You guys hand me the gear. Got it. Dave: I got chuck's extra leg. - Ahh! - Smells like a dead tuna. Narrator: 7:00 a.M... Today, the trig team will search the area of the bermuda triangle where their witness spotted the uso. Moe: I think we got everything, fellas. Narrator: Ship engineer mike still is looking for answers. The bermuda triangle is notorious for boats and airplanes going down all the time. Could it be a uso or related to a uso? That's what we're trying to find out. Turn us loose. If we found something today, it would be mind-boggling and cool as hell at the same time. Push! Jacques cousteau would probably pat us on our back if he was still alive. Dave: A lot of experts believe that usos are sinking ships and abducting people in the bermuda triangle. If we can get to the bottom of this, we might be able to prevent some of that from happening. I mean, maybe we'll find a uso, maybe we'll find some kind of evidence of it. We're just looking for something, because if it was seen there, it had to leave a trace. Narrator: 8:30 a.M... Captain moe and the trig team approach key biscayne, near the western tip of the bermuda triangle. The area is home to dozens of unexplained shipwrecks and the location of their witness's uso encounter. The team is on a mission to determine if the two are related. There are more than 200 sightings of unidentified submerged objects in the triangle every year. Some believe they are alien craft. But former navy rescue swimmer chuck meier has his own theory. Chuck: Unidentified submerged objects... Having worked with the military, having actually held a tsi clearance, my opinion this is all military-grade hardware... Underwater drones, underwater robots. Until I get some really hard evidence, that's where my opinion is gonna stay. This is something military grade. Dave: Chuck likes to say everything that's unidentified is military. I mean, that's his go-to. "Might be underwater military thing. Might be in a flying military thing." for me, I believe there's definitely something supernatural going on in the bermuda triangle. Narrator: While many dispute the theory that usos are military in origin, most experts agree that sightings are particularly common near military bases or vessels. In a 2009 interview, russian rear admiral yury beketov confirmed frequent encounters with usos in the bermuda triangle, and described using sonar to track the underwater objects moving at speeds up to 250 miles an hour, speeds that are impossible for any known manmade craft, civilian or military. Moe: Okay, guys, this was the general area that our eyewitness talked about. See if you find anything strange, any anomalies in the bottom contour. Saw a lighted object that disappeared. So it must have been down deep for it to disappear. But in this depth of water, nothing could fit underneath a boat. Chuck: We're three feet, brother. You know that, right? I know it. Okay. You can't even fit something under a boat in three foot of water. Narrator: To hunt for evidence of unidentified submerged objects, the team will conduct a grid pattern search using a cutting-edge side-scan sonar. This device is capable of creating a detailed map of the ocean floor in three feet of water or 300. Mike: I'm just watching a 3-d. So it's sand and hard bottom right here. And I'm looking for any kind of metal object of any kind or anything like that. You know, something that looks different. Oh, here we go. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15. Holy look how far that goes out. 14, 21, 22. It's just dropping straight off to the bottom. Chuck: So we were out there doing a sonar search. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Then all of a sudden, wham! We get a sharp drop off, goes all the way down. 28, 29, 30, 31. Straight off. That got me really, really excited. Yeah, that is insane. Just drops off like... All right, we're starting to come up the other side here. Here's the other wall coming right up. Came right back up the wall, we're up, back up in three feet of water. Chuck: We just found a hole in the ocean. You couldn't explain it. It literally was just, like, a shaft going straight down in the middle of a six-foot flat. Nowhere have I seen that in all my years under the water. You want to turn around, take another look? Yeah, definitely. Narrator: The team has discovered what appears to be a 30-foot deep hole or shaft in the ocean floor. Repeated passes from other angles indicate that it is approximately 45-feet long by 45-feet wide with straight edges and a flat bottom. I think it's time to get wet. Chuck: Being an amputee and a prosthetic user, I can still do pretty much everything that I did before. In 2003, went overseas to a fine place called baghdad. I hit a 155-pound ied, and it blew my truck up. I knew that life had changed instantly for me, but just kept going. Together: One, two, three. Stick together. Safe dive. I hear you loud and clear. Chuck: So when we got in the water, everything was pretty much normal. And then when we reached the ledge, straight down, bam! At this time, I can't wrap my head around what this is. I'm describing it as a hot knife through butter. That's how sharp the edges are. I copy. Straight up and down. I don't know if it's manmade or not, but just to find something like this is pretty mysterious. You know, out on the middle of the ocean. Maybe some place to hide. What it looked like to me was it looked like somebody actually cut out a big square hunk of planet. Who knows? It could be a project of some kind. A tunnel, a mine. But it's definitely not put there by nature. Nature doesn't do that. Diver one, come back to the surface. Copy. You've made it to the bottom. Narrator: 4:45 p.M... The triangle research and investigation group has discovered a bizarre 30-foot shaft that appears to have been excavated from the ocean floor at the location of a 2016 uso sighting. I think it was a uso hiding spot, to be honest with you. So we decided to put up a trail cam because it's the best way to see if anything's coming in and out of there. Roger that. Here we go. They're back. He's just gonna walk over. There's something weird down there, brother. - Yeah? - I ain't seen it before. Dave: Definitely, definitely not act of nature. It looks like a cheese cutter just came down and just hacked it off. Dave: It was definitely not nature. Nature didn't make it. It had to be something made... Manmade, alien made. Something else made this. It's literally like a square here. You go about 40, 50 feet, and there's another square. And nature don't do that. Not in a straight line. No, no, no. So literally something could disappear up in there. - We did. - Yeah. But, gentlemen, if you wanted to find something, that's what we wanted to find. That's... that's insane. Nice dive, guys. Chuck: What do you think it would take to construct something like that? It would be quite an endeavor. Narrator: 10:00 a.M... For the past three days, the trig team has been researching possible explanations for the underwater shaft, and they're still on the hunt for answers. Would definitely have to have a serious barge out there with some sort of a backhoe. You're talking about busting through limestone. A couple of days ago, we went out, put an underwater trail cam into the shaft that we located. But when we went out to retrieve it and view the video, all we saw was bubbles and fish. Back in the day, you know, of course, they used to use dynamite. But dynamite wouldn't leave you squared-off shaft. No. That being said, that's part of the investigation. You don't get what you want. You get what you get. Today, we're gonna meet with a guy named mike bara, who's a bermuda triangle expert. Hey, mike. How are you? And see if he can give us anything that might result in a lead. So we met this witness up in biscayne bay, and he said he saw some lights circling around his boat. We went to the location, dove the spot, and location was that we found of a shaft that goes down into the bedrock. Right in the same area where this guy witnessed this light. Yeah. Amazing. It's almost as if you guys found some sort of operational facilities under the water where these unidentified submerged objects, these usos, operate from. What do people think these things are? So there's all kinds of theories. There are people that think that there are alien bases operating in the bermuda triangle. The other possibility is that the lost continent of atlantis, the ancient civilization, is actually somewhere in the bermuda triangle. And in fact, that these usos are, like, automated defense forces, defense devices that still exist, that are just making sure you're not there to cause any trouble. One of the things that mike told us was possible theory is atlantis is in the bermuda triangle. I don't know if I could put a whole lot of stock in that explanation. I mean, I find it kind of hard to believe that an ancient civilization has technology that's jacking with us today. So what you think about the military being a solution to some of these questions? Because one thing I know that the military does is they don't divulge their secrets a whole lot. I think that's interesting. However, if you were in the military and you had this technology, are you gonna show it off by buzzing around somebody's fishing trawler in the middle of biscayne bay? Chuck's theories on these usos is that they're military. But mike had a real valid point that the military likes to keep their things secret. So running out around a dinner cruise just isn't really keeping it secret. That's almost taunting. It also doesn't explain christopher columbus. We did not have this military technology back in those days. And there are other reports from many other ships through the years when we clearly did not have that type of technology at the time. So I have a tendency to think that the root source of these encounters has got to be something alien. Oh, wow. The question is, what's the purpose of it all? So we had a good meeting with mike. I mean, and he gave us a lot of useful information about usos. Most of them don't seem that credible to me. So I don't know if we're any closer to finding the answer than we were before. We just got to keep investigating. Mike: 64. Chuck: 64. 86, 49, 67. Dancing lights. Gotcha. That's bermuda. Give me another one. Narrator: Saturday, 3:15 p.M... Two miles south of bimini. Swarm of small lights. The team has crowdsourced reports of usos from the internet, news sources, and social media. Now, mike and chuck are creating a heat map in hopes of finding a new area for the team to investigate. What I did is we crowdsourced a bunch of uso sightings. Michael's reading the places off to me, and I'm putting the pinpricks on the map. And this gives us a visual representation of where somebody had witnessed something that we can't explain right now. I think a lot of these are military technology. Andros island. I've been there, big military installations here, a lot of submarine activity. So I can tell you why I dismissed andros island. Andros island is a military testing facility where they... It's called all-tech, where they test drive all submarines and anything that comes out of a submarine, so we can take that off the grid sheet. A whole lot of hotspots in the florida keys. Every entity, agency that has ever existed within the united states army, navy, air force, marines, coast guard, they live here. One up here in bermuda. I don't know that I can explain those. That's the tip of the bermuda triangle. What this tells me is that's our next check on the map that we need to go investigate. All right. You put any stock in the bermuda triangle stories? Oh, yeah. Those stories are real, man. Believe it or not, they are real. Narrator: Bermuda... The triangle research and investigation group has traveled to this isolated island at the northern tip of the bermuda triangle to continue their investigation. They've identified five witnesses who reported unidentified submerged objects off the island's coast. And mike and chuck are on their way to interview one of them. This is a very eerie, eerie place. So many shipwrecks around here, it's just a lot of mystery with this place, man. You know, we call them strange encounters of the bermuda kind. Chuck: So we tracked down one of the witnesses that reported a uso off the coast of bermuda. He's going to give us a firsthand account and a description of what he witnessed. You must be kairi? Hey, yes. What's happening? If it has the same characteristics as the ones in florida, well, we might have the same entity or might have the same craft. I'm very interested in seeing what he has to say. So you hit us up on on the internet? Yeah. I mean, we came a long way. We're ready to hear a story. Well, I'd say about seven months ago, me and my brother and my nephew went fishing. The water was nice and calm. But we happen to run into a bump. Big bang. Hit the bottom of the boat. At first, I thought I ran into a rock or something. I'd say about 30 seconds later, I see a white object floating about 10 meters off the boat. It's a big, glowing, white type of looking object. All right. You're saying big, glowing, and white. Yes. How big? About two and a half feet. All right. So two and a half feet to three feet. And it's coming close to the boat. I'd say about three meters away from the boat. Tips on. I've never seen an object like this. You know what I mean? Chuck: My first impression of kairi, his information seemed reliable. How is the weather conditions that day? - Was it calm, rough? - It was pretty calm. It wasn't like today what you see here now. Chuck: I can't tell you what he saw, but I can tell you he believes he saw something that he can't describe. Do you think this was a machine or was it an animal? I would go towards a machine, but it was in the water, so I can't really... Did it swim like a fish that you've ever seen? No. It wasn't a dolphin or a whale? No, no. So you've experienced what's known as a uso, and other people have seen the same thing that you have. Whoa. There were some pretty significant similarities between kairi's story and tony's story. Tony saw an orb circling his boat. Kairi's statement... There was an orb circling his boat. They couldn't identify it as anything biologic. They both said it was glowing, and then it disappeared. Two people who've never met each other, one at one end of the bermuda triangle, and the other one at the other end of the bermuda triangle having a similar experience. That speaks volumes. It's possible that usos could be the reason we have a whole lot of missing ships and wrecks in the bermuda triangle. Narrator: 9:00 a.M... The team has secured a local boat, and today they will search the uso hot zone five miles off the coast of bermuda. So today we're heading out to check out the uso sightings. This particular area that we're heading to, there's been quite a few. So for us, this is real exciting. We're hopefully gonna find out why so many people have seen sightings of uso in this particular spot. Chuck: So the uso search in florida was kind of cool. I mean, we found a cool shaft. Still unexplained. I still don't know what it is. But the crowdsourced intel that we have coming in shows that there are more of these sightings in bermuda than was in florida. So the opportunity to go up there and possibly find something, yeah, that's great. A home run would be any evidence, actual physical evidence of something that I can't explain... A uso. That, to me, home-run. Moe: We're presently just off the coast of bermuda. We've started our expanded circle grid using our bottom finder. This is the area where the usos were sighted, and the conditions are basically normal. Even though it's absolutely beautiful, it's a very strange place. Chuck: Mike and moe are a real good team because they've been looking at sonar screens and readings for years and years. They can tell you what a school of fish looks like, what wrecks on the bottom look like. Here we've got something. Look at this. Look at this. It's when they scratch their head or rub their beard in a certain way... Hey, guys, I think we found something here. Come on, check this out. That you know that we've got something different and something worth looking at. - Oh, yeah. Look at that. - Look at this. Dave: There's definitely something down there. Moe: Here we got something. Look at this. That's a lot of fish on something here. Hey, guys, come on, check this out. Narrator: 12:15 p.M... The triangle research and investigation group is in the uso hot zone at the northern tip of the bermuda triangle, and they've just gotten a hit on their sonar. - What'd you find? - Check that out, dave. Oh, yeah. Look at that. Look at this. Moe: Well, about 90 minutes into our sonar search, we hit a mark. Looked like a massive object sitting on the bottom. Definitely was made out of something other than coral. And look how you've got gaps. - Oh, yeah. Look at that. - Look at this. Dave: There's definitely something down there. It's structure. Let's drive back over that. Chuck: We were asking ourselves, "wouldn't it be great if this was a uso? Wouldn't this be great if it it led us to a uso?" so we needed to get in there as soon as we could. Copy. Diver two's at the bottom. Sandy bottom, copy. What are you seeing, diver two? Talk to us. You're saying it's a vessel. Chuck: It took us a couple of minutes to get orientated, but when we did, we saw a big boat. There was no real growth on it. There was no corals. So that gave me some kind of indicator that it hadn't been down that long. Now I'm looking for other indicators of how did it sink. Maybe it was sunk by a uso. Diver one, diver two, let's keep an eye on your air. Let's not go past 500 psi. Mike: The worst-case scenario when you're in the wreck, your gear gets caught up and then you run out air. Go ahead, diver one. Roger that. Copy. That certainly could be a problem. Chuck: The hole that I found in the bottom looked like it was placed there. Once you put a hole in the bottom of a boat, it effectively becomes a submarine. People have done this in the past to create fishing spots. It's structure on the bottom. And what does structure do? It creates a house for biologics to sit at. Not the dive we were looking for. Not what we're looking for. All right, come on up. Did it make me mad that it wasn't anything that had to do with our actual investigation? I'd be lying to you if I told you it didn't, but we're still in the area. This area has a whole lot of sightings. You have to keep going on. Look at the peaks. I think that's fish, mike. Yeah. Moe: You know, the trick to investigating these sort of occurrences is perseverance. We still have plenty of time and plenty of water to search, so we still believe that we're gonna find something here. Here we go. Looky here. Looky here, look here. Wow. Check this out, moe. Look at that. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. - Look how deep that went. - Sheer drop off. Oh, yes. It went from 18 feet down to 50. Let me get set up and we'll drive back over it. But look, so you can tell there's a hole underneath here. Chuck: The water's clear enough. You should be able to see it from the top. Coming straight up the other side. We come over the edge... bam. Bottom drops out 90 degrees. Hit the wall, comes back up. This looks like the exact same thing that we have in florida. All the depths seem to be right. That's a coincidence. Narrator: Like the shaft off key biscayne, this hole is 45-feet wide in 45-feet long, but it lies in 18 feet of water. Dave: It's just like florida. A shaft in the middle of the ocean. I don't exactly understand what this means, but I know that there's two of them in two different places that look exactly the same. I instantly am like, "I'm getting in the water." 3... 2... 1. Moe: 3... 2... 1. Roger that. Safe dive. Narrator: 6:00 p.M... After a day of searching the uso hot zone, the triangle research and investigation group has found an anomaly on the ocean floor, eerily similar to the one they discovered 1,000 miles away on the other end of the bermuda triangle. Copy. Do your best and report back what you see. Chuck: Swimming to this shaft was very similar to the way we did it down in florida. Peeked our hear over the side, looked straight down, and followed the wall all the way to the bottom. Bam. There we were again. Is there any sort of other rock formations at all? Straight up and down, aye-aye. You know, if something dug it out, it's hard telling exactly why somebody would say, "hey, let's put a hole right there." so, you know, is it natural? That's still undetermined. And then on top of that, the debris from actually being made, like, it should have rock piles or some sort. But there's no debris. Copy, straight down. Dave: I'm looking at chuck. He's looking at me. We're getting a little spooked out. It just seemed manmade in a place where man wouldn't make it. It looked so familiar. Here they come. Yeah. Tell us about it. Nice job. Come on up, man. Come on. Come on. Come on. Sit. Back up. Chest up. Okay. So we went over the side. Same size, same wall, same size of cutout. It's the same thing. So do you feel like it tells us anything about the uso sightings? It definitely gives a lot of credibility to it. It's either the government made it and didn't tell anybody or somebody or something else made it and didn't tell anybody. If I was a uso, I would hide me in there. Narrator: Monday, 4:00 p.M... The trig team has returned to their home base in florida, and they've arranged for marine scientist julie cheon to examine footage of the bizarre uso shafts. Chuck: All right. So we just got back from an investigation, and we found two different anomalies that are almost exactly the same. Chuck: We've spent the last week doing these uso shaft investigations, and today I want to try to beat it to death with a little science. So we're gonna meet with a marine scientist, show her some videos, have somebody look at it from a different perspective, if you will. We don't know what they are. Okay. But what we're running into is something that looks like this. It's 45 wide, 45 long, and 30 foot deep all the way down to the bottom. Wow. Does that make any sense to you? Not just a random square like that. That shape is pretty distinctive. How far away is it from any landmass? In the middle of nowhere. There's nothing around it. It's very odd. What I'm gonna show you now is I'm gonna show you the florida shaft. Okay, great. So you do have marine life in there, both animals and plants, but that's not unusual on either natural or manmade excavations. Yeah, the vertical walls are just... They're so up and down, it seems so intentional. I can't totally rule out a natural formation, but it's very similar to the constructed areas I've seen. I was thinking if anyone knows what these shafts are, it's gonna be the scientists. This is a scientist, someone that studies this stuff, does this stuff on a daily, weekly basis, and she couldn't come up with an answer for us. That's atypical for anything that I see in nature in general. This is a huge deal finding these two shafts that are very similar. It's a pattern and it's spooky. Chuck: And here's the bermuda shaft. Okay, great. This was roughly the same dimensions? 45, 45, and 30. Not even roughly... 45, 45, and 30 foot deep, and here's... That is amazing. If you were to make one of these holes, how would you actually make it? Would you use dynamite or some kind of heavy operated equipment? What I've seen them do is use the heavy operator equipment, which would be more conducive to the straight vertical edges that you're seeing there. Those flats that we're going on, they're so shallow that to get the barge on that flat, it would bottom out before we can even get on top of it. Now, that's a great point. And, you know, just getting the equipment out there to create something like this, you know, the challenges with that would be very difficult. So one of julie's statements was to build a structure or shaft like that, it would be a big construction project. That, to me, would be something that would cost a lot of money, and it would definitely be something that people would notice. But this is not natural. I've never seen anything in nature like it. And of course, this leads up to the next question... Who has the ability to build something like this? And what's it for? We've got two different witnesses at two different locations that are reporting unidentified submerged objects, and then we have these. Do you think they have anything to do with each other? Well, that's probably outside of my area of expertise. But when you come up with two objects that are shaped like this in the middle of nowhere with the same dimensions, with no reasonable explanation, it certainly begs the question of what is going on here. Chuck: We showed her the videos, and she said that they had to be built by someone or something. It wasn't something that happened overnight. They're enormous. Yeah. So in the beginning of this whole adventure, I was of the mind-set that most of these sightings were gonna be military, and I can't say that I've changed my mind a whole lot if I was the military and I wanted to hide a uso, this is the place that I would do it. Dave: Well, if we found two, there's probably more out there. I mean, think about it. You know, one. Eh. Two's a coincidence. Three, what do we call that? An act of war. You're a. No matter how you put it, this is an awesome find. We saw two different shafts. We have two different witnesses. We have pictures of a uso. We're searching out uso sightings, and we're finding similarities in different parts of the world. There has to be some connection that relates right back to the bermuda triangle, something, because it's not a coincidence.
