Faster than TGV, you explode! Mind my wedding gift. I said bags, not sheep. Bags first and sheep after... I'll pay these guys, Demba! You see to the tickets. Do it, but do it properly. Conakry! All aboard, here we go! Get your money out, come on! Demba, come on! You can see it's urgent. Who's that babe? With the pearls. I don't know. Ask all the passengers their names. I need all your names... Chief Rambo is the one asking. He makes the laws on this bus. Okay, Corporal Diop. Occupy all fronts in every direction. Sergeant Dialo! Cover the western sector... No, face outwards. Face outwards. Arm in hand! Unload the refugees! Get those tents rigged! Hurry! Take the pegs. Get the canvas nice and tight. The second tent now... - Going to Guinea? - To Conakry, yes. The Bijagos have risen up. I'll go via Tchoukouey then. That's their area too. We don't know how far they'll go. Not with Kalinga at their head. I've evacuated the villages. I'll go via Fongoli. Look... Get killed if you want but the passengers are your responsibility. Okay, I'll talk to them. Shut up. Listen to me! I'm Rambo, he's Demba. I'll drive you to Guinea. If you want to get off, Demba will refund you. I'm getting my bag. Do we have an escort? No, we're protecting the refugees. You'll be travelling at your own risk. Nine passengers. Never mind, we're going anyway. You're completely mad. You get a salary. This is what feeds me! My charms protect TGV. Don't be scared. I'm not! Let's go, chief. We're 15 minutes late. Let's pull out. - Going to Conakry? - Get in! Demba, the bags. Abdoulaye Sall! Our Minister of Finance! The government fired you? I was dismissed, miss. You're ridiculous. You recognize me? It's the red tie. That's all we notice on TV. Besides, no one in my village speaks French. Let's go, chief. Sit down, madam. Sir, sit in first class. That's odd. On TV, you seem to have a moustache. It's tough being thrown out. Let's hope they reach Dakar tomorrow. The camp's full. What do you mean? Not heard the news since you were fired? Don't be so insolent, miss. Madam, not miss. Could someone tell me what's happening? Tell him. The refugees. The Bijagos. The Bijagos have rebelled. Go on... Go on then! The farmers are fleeing. The military have set up a camp in Dakar for the refugees. That's all. You speak well. They're causing all this trouble to get their totem back? Kalinga's mad. If you don't respect the people, they'll throw you out... Everyone comes to see the totem in the museum, even tourists. Darling, we ought to go back to Dakar. I need the phone... It's been a short trip, sir. It's not working. Your mobile's poorly. Driver, we must return to Dakar immediately! His name's Rambo. No, we're going to Conakry. It's not your decision. Yes! We're going to Conakry, even if we die! Darling, it's dangerous. Let's turn back. Don't you agree, madam? No, madam. Very well... Since you won't let political leaders decide for you, I suggest we vote. - You're mad! - You'll see. That's a good idea, let's vote. I don't care about you, I want to go to Conakry! Wait... Just wait. Before you raise your hands for Conakry, listen to me at this tragic time. Consider the consequences of your decision. Think of the people waiting for you... Exactly. If you raise that hand... Can we vote now? Gentlemen... You're ridiculous again. He wants to get off! No way! If he wants a leak, open the door. No, he wants his bag. Climb up and get it. - Without stopping? - Yes. Could you give me a cigarette? A normal one... You should try a special one. Ever used that gun? It was my father's. I've only used it once, when I was 8. I almost shot my mother and sister. Take your time, you're hooked up to 220 volts... Life'll look rosy after. Demba... Are you asleep? There's a secret, on the tip of my tongue... I'm dying to tell someone. Go on, I'm listening. I've got four beautiful wives... I'm off to Guinea to marry the fifth one. I've got her photo. She's a pretty little thing. It's all been arranged now. My husband's marrying his sister-in-law. And we were so much in love... If his brother died, I don't see why the family is making your husband marry her. The marabout is his uncle. He decided that they had to marry. You're right to leave. I'd do the same thing. They don't scare me anymore. When I look at them, I feel like laughing. Why do they treat women like that? They don't like us. They do, but only for certain things... Pretty wild... I can turn you to ashes. You hate women so you ignore them. Shut up, woman! Leave her alone or I'll throw you off. Chill out... - I've done no harm. - I don't mean you. I'll destroy TGV. - He did it! - Shut up! I need water to get TGV going again. I have some left. Let's wait for the rains here. Water, water, a bit more water. Does your chief know my power? It's a mechanical fault. He's not pleased. Oh, fucking hell! Stop messing about, will you? Big storm... This damn bus leaks. Give him the gum. - Chew it and block the hole. - Why didn't you do it earlier? I'm getting wet! Give everybody some. Rambo! Welcome! - Always on time. - Yes, always. Go and check the exhaust for me. Come in, we've got a hot meal for you. Ladies, the toilet's back there. Excuse me. Ladies here, men over there. - Are the mats for sleeping? - Anything you like. Go and fill the tank, okay? But don't leave the bus. Come straight back. Innkeeper! Give me a cold drink and a King Size. I don't sell alcohol, to avoid trouble. My husband needs a man like you. Are you stopping in Conakry? My master will be there for the fetishers' meeting. We can't smoke or drink. Excuse me, guys, I need to take a walk. Mr Minister... Matches... James! Buy us a drink? Get out or I'll kill you! Okay, I'll let you go... Let me by, I'll plug them. - James? - Let me by, I said! I'll blow their brains out. They had fun with you... Drink after grass makes you do dumb things. - Let me go. - It doesn't matter, go to bed. - You'll forget by tomorrow. - No... It does matter. They'll be back. They'll be back? You knew them? Yes. - I owe them money. - A lot? - A lot. - It's drugs... Stay here. I'll wake everyone and we'll leave now. Come on! Ask no questions. Hurry. Give me my gun. What is it now? There's a camp there, ahead. We can't afford to take any risks. Have they gone? What do you think? My biscuits! Offer the marabout one. Which one of them? Both of them, you never know. Going back to sleep? Where did you get all that? I remembered breakfast before we left. You're a genius! Have you got enough for three sandwiches? I can't give you breakfast but a wash will do you good. Don't piss me off. Me neither. If you want to cry, go on, no one can see you. You look better. I'll stay like this. You have lovely breasts. Do something! Do something! What did I do? This marabout's stronger than the other. Look over there. Where are the cows? Over there! Those are spirits... They're white spirits. It's your fault. No, it's yours. Just two "red ears". - Americans? - No. They're French. Not as good but the same idea. Rambo, don't let them on. Show some hospitality. Haven't the French taken enough? I won't travel with spirits. I'll take two extra fares. I suggest we vote. If you want the whities on board, raise you hands. Greet them the same way. It's their way of welcoming us. Move down the aisle. We're going to Conakry. Does that suit you? Conakry's perfect. Is this the right road? You're lost? I've got a map. Are the cows yours? The cows? Of course. The cows are yours? No, we were in a canoe on the Gambia. Oh, right. We're near the river then? Yes. Can I sit here? Now, my glasses... Here they are. Now, we're here, see? There was a lake here once but it's a stream now. On the other side, a trail skirts Kedougou and leads directly to Guinea. It's easy. - Head east... - That's not a recent map. 18th century but it hasn't changed much. We study Mandingo history. Roger's my tutor and I'm Sylvia. Roger Martin, ethnology lecturer. The tickets cost 8,000 CFA francs. Each. Are you ready? I'll show you the way. Let's go. - I've found the page. - Show me. What's that? I'm doing a thesis on Aboubakary II. Heard of him? Aboubakary II? A Mandingo ruler who set off across the Atlantic in 1311. We're doing research on him. - Oh, right. - Not bad, huh? Aboubakary II. It'll work. A few logs but we can shift them in no time. We'll get trapped? - Who by? - The Bijagos. - What did he say? - The people have fled. The Bijagos are at war. Sylvia, are you okay? Come and help me, Rambo. Right, we're going to sleep out in the open. Where are the others? The Minister and his wife are busy with the marabouts. And Salambar? I don't know. Can you go and see? It's Sylvia's first time in the bush, she's a bit nervous. Can we light a fire to keep animals away? I'd rather not. Let's not get noticed. You never know with the Bijagos. Let's not get noticed, let's talk quietly. It's okay... What's that? It could be a lion. That's all we need! - Taken your medicine? - Of course I have! Something smells good. You don't look too hot. I'm fine! Well, not really... That corpse, the war with the Bijagos... Don't worry, I've got grass to cure that. Like the good old days. My first corpse. What about epidemics, famine... You've never known them. You follow in our ancestors' footsteps but one dead man, just one, makes you tremble. We bury children in mass graves. You've never seen children dying and vultures waiting to eat them? Leave us alone. The only dead man I've seen was my father. Why say all that? We've done nothing to you. TGV won't start. Another breakdown! Wait! Someone stole a sheep... Look at the rope! It was stolen! It's because of your magic! Think about it. It can't have been one of us. And why would the Bijagos have taken a sheep and left us? The spirits must be angry. It's not enough. Let's calm the spirits and go. TGV's broken down. Mend it then. I don't have the part. No way! Let's sacrifice a sheep. What did he say? Sacrifice a sheep and let its blood flow over a virgin. The spirits will be content with a white woman. It could be perfect for your thesis. You'll have a very rare experience. Are you out of your mind? We can't just stay here... We have to do something. This is unbelievable. It's not working. Kill another one. No! That's enough already! Come over here. The Gods didn't listen. I have another solution. Let's all draw straws now To see who gets eaten first... Don't be so nervous. White people are taboo for the Bijago. Think of your thesis. Aboubakary was here in 1309. It's disconcerting. I can't grip this wheel. Rambo, why does the wheel move? Can we control things? When TGV goes straight, the wheel moves. Is your leg better? It's fine if I don't walk. I hope it doesn't get infected. My back's itching now. This is unbelievable. You'd be better at the back. Say so then. Demba, come up here. - I've brought the kid. - I was fine. - I thought... - Don't think too much! Put your backs into it! Push on the bumper. Maybe you don't do mechanical miracles? It's not our fault, there's a heathen here. It's not a spirit. A stone under the wheel. Carry on! You could be a teacher or a farmer. I can't stand kids and know nothing about land. Or mechanic! Minister's better. That's why I'm off to Guinea. You could train for a new job. Stop it, you're annoying me! Just trying to help. God helps those who help themselves. - Your friend needs you. - Why? To find a job for the ex-Minister. A restaurant's a good idea. A restaurant? That's a great idea! Quick, go and tell him. Good to see you. There's no one here. Madam! I've found a millet store! I'll teach you to pound it. I can't do that! I don't want to learn to cook! I'll help. I'm starving. Know what the trouble is? We can't get any privacy. What for? Is Conakry far from here? Yes, it's a long way. Salambar! Can I talk to you? I'm with Seynabou and Sylvia. We've cleaned up a hut for the night. We want to talk among women. I'm going now. I wanted to talk to you. Nothing... Good night. Hi, Rambo. Got a light for me? I wanted to thank you... Forget it. Seen Seynabou? They don't want us. - What? - Just women together. Beautiful starry night, isn't it, Rambo? If you stay here, shut up. Have you got a light? Ask Rambo. Will you ever give up? I didn't sell it to him, I gave it to him. Didn't I? He did... Calm down, we'll share it. I don't give a damn. The Bijagos are going wild and you smoke joints. That's true. I'm anxious about the Bijagos. It's worrying. Sylvia! Do you make tea with it? Just chew a leaf to prevent infection. Don't think about it. It'll do you good. With the men standing guard, at least we're safe here. Sure, if a Bijago turns up, they'll dive under the bus! I've brought you food. Why are you laughing? You'd make a great husband. I've already got four wives. A fifth one is what you need. You see... You see I like your breasts. Another sheep has been stolen! I think we're on this trail. At least, I hope so. Now, if we could find this other trail here... I spotted an old trail that wasn't on the map. An old trail behind the hill there. They've done it again! Your sheep have pissed on my suit! You make us travel with stinking animals! Leave him alone! Leave him, I said! I'll leave him... But either we dump the animals or kill them. Don't touch my sheep! Kill them, reload and off we go. No one's touching my wedding gifts! Enough! Listen to me. You either obey or get off. - So, do we kill the sheep? - No! Move the suit. You're the thief! You thief... Just calm down. He's the thief! Shut up! I'm in charge here. Everybody out! Get out, I said. All of you! All aboard for Conakry! All aboard! What's wrong? Nothing. I'm having a leak. I can see you're sulking. You've an odd way of looking at Rambo. You ride on top. Keep an eye on your sheep. I'll go with him. Demba! We're off... All aboard! All aboard for Conakry! When do we get there? With TGV, you always get there. Hey! Wait for me! Where is it exactly? Straight ahead, behind those trees. Is it dust? No, it's smoke. Give me that. What is it now? The Bijagos! There! Where? We saw them... Their fires... Rambo, take the left-hand trail. I don't know it. Ask Roger, he's got the map. This must lead to the old river bed. There was gold here. There was fighting too. The Bijagos tried to stop Aboubakary II. The Bijagos refused to convert to Islam. The Mandingo empire stretched to the sea... Head north-west... This must feed the Niokolo River. Then head south, straight for Guinea, behind the hill. I hope. Let's hope it works. Hold on tight. Hold up on there, I'm backing up. I'll break TGV if I carry on. The gold prospectors drove goats so there must be a trail. Keep on going forward! I can't carry on... My men aren't far now. It's an ambush! We've been trapped. What do they want? Our jewels, our money... If we hand it over, we'll be okay. Okay! Don't panic! The Bijagos always do this. They want money, not lives. Have you forgotten the dead man in the river? We're not going to take this... It's the Bijagos. Salambar! Come here. You were right, there was a heathen. I knew it. Cowardly scumbag. In the old days, the Bijagos knocked out their victims before quartering them... Just belt up... We have French passports. I'll talk to their chief. Just belt up... They're coming for us. Know who ate your sheep? Your friend. Your wedding is ruined. Kalinga wants the chief. I'm not the chief. He is... Rambo. Follow me. Kalinga isn't a killer. All those dead people, those bodies... Where did you see them? Keep your nightmares. She's right... Let's not get carried away. We can use the modern media. 35 TV channels, fax, satellite... We have gold to pay for weapons and spies. What do you want? We cherish our traditions. Our birth totem was taken from a village and put in a museum. When we get it back, we'll lay down our arms. I understand and I respect that. But why my passengers? My spies told me the ex-Minister was going to Guinea. He'll be named Prime Minister in ten days time. I see... So talk to him instead! A promise isn't enough. To be modern, we must use the media. I took your bus to take the Minister hostage. But the whites interest me more. You want to take them hostage? The French government will want them back safely. The future Prime Minister is a perfect go-between. I was very lucky to get everyone. You want to keep the whites and let us go? That's where I need you. You have leadership qualities. I don't want any violence. The two whites must surrender to us. Then you'll be able to leave. It won't be easy persuading them. You've got all night. I'm counting on you. Can I ask you something? Would you kill them for a totem? Of course we would. Tell them when they finish. - Respect their customs. - Do they respect us? We'll be leaving soon. All right, my friends... It's been a tiring trip for someone seriously wounded like me. We've stuck together through this ordeal so let's not split up now. What are you saying? There's strength in numbers. - It won't be easy. - Chill out... Kalinga's his friend. Your government will help because France is powerful. This could last years. It's happened before. It won't be any shorter if we stay. Can't we talk this over calmly? You white people pass through and then we never see you again. You don't care about our problems. Did you stop your government taking the totem? You're responsible, not Sylvia and me. We're not going to die for a lump of wood! Sure! Who looks at totems in a museum? We don't care. They're for tourists. We're not tourists, miss. You're adventurers. We're scientists. You remind me of that movie... The guy with the whip and hat. "The Lost Ark"... You're looking for adventure? Our families are waiting. All right, in that case, we'll tell Kalinga to keep the Minister and his wife. You're right. You're cowards. I'll talk to Kalinga. He doesn't care about the Minister. He wants you. I don't care about him either. Neither Sylvia nor I are going to panic or lose hope. Fine. Be careful what you do. Kalinga has informers at a very high level. He took TGV because he knew the Minister would. He also knows you'll be the next government's Prime Minister. Let him go on. I'm pals with a future Prime Minister... You're a better catch so the Minister leaves with us to negotiate. That's the situation. You have until dawn to decide. This is unbelievable! Darling... Kalinga may change his mind. We're leaving. She needs to pee. The Minister and his wife are three miles away. My men let them walk a little before stopping them. - It's for you. - Thanks. I've kept it clean. Our brave Prime Minister! I'm glad they let you go. I was going for help. We left in the night. We have a list of things for you... My little brother can't find a place in school. A little push could help. I've screwed up. The police are hassling me. If they back off, I won't do it again. Darling! Note it all down. Pass a law against polygamy. That won't be easy, miss. Madam! Your vanity case. We'd like to say that we won't ask for anything. That's good. But our master's fees are left to your discretion. Now that's sorted out, maybe we can go. Wait! We haven't finished. If you ban polygamy, think about men like me. See this winged traveller, so awkward and weak! He was so fine: how droll and ugly now! One sailor sticks a cutty in his beak, Another limps to mock the bird that flew! The poet is a prince of the clouds Who haunts the tempest, scorns the bows and slings. Exiled on earth amid the crowds, He cannot walk, for he has giant's wings." Go on TV and say how I saved Senegal. Make sure France knows I negotiated fair treatment for the hostages. Does it suit me? I want a TV crew and newspaper journalists, even the opposition ones. Organize it at the Grand Hotel. We'll make a big impact. Well? Shit! It still doesn't work. Madam Minister, try to get a bit higher. Often the idle mariners at sea Catch albatrosses, birds of the deep... Mr Minister, your suit fits me perfectly. It's working! The mobile's working! Let me sit in the front. It's my place. Impossible. He's TGV. Hello, my friends. You're a pretty little thing. Give me two minutes, dear... This is for Kalinga. I'll give it to him. Isn't she a bit young for you? It's school before marriage. Me not speak French, nor Wolof... - Want me to come? - No. When will I see you again? Africa is a small place for two people so much in love. Rambo! Look, they're going to Dakar. For a women's conference! Demba, we're off! Hey, Rambo! Got room for one to Dakar? Here we go!
