Yes, sir. Anyone out there? Come in here! The victim is KANG Jae-doo, 51 years old, arrested on blackmail charges 5 years ago. He came to this place last month after his release, but a few days ago he put the house up for rent. Before he was arrested, he lived with a woman named SUH Hae-young, who kept transferring money to his bank account even after they had split up. Are you positive it's a suicide? There are signs of resistance that suggest otherwise. Things like that are found at every suicide scene. Without a suicide note, I think we should focus on the possibility of murder. You have no idea how rarely suicides leave a note. Then why did he put the house up for rent if he was going to commit suicide? Hey! - Take off the damn sunglasses! - Shut up, both of you! Autopsy? End of next week at the earliest. Shit! They're always slow. Chief! Chief! Let me through! Another body was found. 14 years ago Hey. Sung-sik! Yes'? Check out the rescue center and meet me inside. OK. Dong-soo! - Turn the light on. - Got it. Snowflakes... are falling... Sir! - Over there? - Yes, sir. - Take this. - Tae-ho! - Is this the only passage? - That's what I heard. As the cabin was locked from inside, this must be the only way out. Who found this first? - Look who's here. - Look who's talking. What an asshole to choose such a tricky place! Let's move up. - Hello. - Dad, where are you? Hi, Min-jae. - Did he die instantly? - Probably in less than a minute. His coronary artery was cut, so his heart burst right away. Any blood spillage? Only a little. He had almost no external hemorrhages. I'm not sure about the weapon, though. Something long and sharp, but not a knife. - Yes, we'll go sleighing. OK? - What about the estimated time of death? Somewhere between 13 and 24 hours ago considering the rigor mortis and the opaque corneas. Jeez! You're going to sink the ship! - Be careful. - Are you sure the door was locked? Ask him. How is it going? We're still working on it. - Anything missing? - No. Nothing special. But, there's no lighter. You can lose it anywhere. Jesus! Come on! Here's the man in eternal sleep. If the door was locked from inside, how did the murderer get out? Who found the body? A kid who crawled up through the food elevator passage. What on earth was he doing here? There's no playground in the neighborhood, and this ship is the kids' favorite hangout. Did you notice anything strange about that kid? You sometimes treat people like beasts. A murderer is worse than a brute! Got it? Here he goes again. What the... What is this? It's one or the other. He ate too much or had a helluva lot of fun. What a dump for such a rich man to fool around in. Please move aside for the victim's photo. The victim is KIM Si-who, 45 years old. He runs a big pawnshop in Incheon. He has a 41-year-old wife, SUH Hae-young and a 14-year-old son, KIM Yo-han. The estimated time of death is 9 pm on the 19th. All the crime scene investigators found were the victim's belongings, bloodstains and fingerprints. And bloodstain analysis is in progress. - And there's also YANG Mi-sook. - A suspect? Yes, she was having an affair with the victim. She is the prime suspect at the moment. She regularly borrowed money from the victim but never paid him back. Anything else suspicious? On the day of the murder, the victim was seen heading to YANG'S house with a cake box. What is that? What the hell is that? Ah, I found it at the scene, but the CSI team sent it back. All right. I was about to leave. Move your asses! Hey, Tae-ho. Let's go. - Ah, Dong-soo! - Huh? You were right about the lighter. He had a Zippo with a tiger emblem and always carried it. Is that so? Hey kid, you live here? We're police. We need to ask your mom something. Is she home? She'll be back soon. I see... Then, may we wait for her inside? Then... show me. Show you what? Your badge. Ah... sure! You've got it? Geez... Here. Thank you! Hey kid! What's your name? Jia. LEE Jia. Jia... Pretty name. What are you reading? Oh, Gone with the Wind! I haven't read it yet. - Like it? - Yes. Don't tell me you don't know it. There's a movie, too. Seen it? No... Jia... by any chance... do you know the pawnbroker living uptown? Yes. How do you know him? He sometimes comes by. I see. Jia! I told you to lock the door! Are you Ms. YANG Mi-sook? We're investigating a murder. I believe you know the man who was killed, KIM Si-who. Murder? We're retracing his steps before the murder. Did he come here on the 19th? No, he didn't. He brought the cake, didn't he? Ah... Yes, he did. He stopped by that day. I forgot about it. What brought him here? He just visits us now and then to check on me and my daughter. Well, he lent you money regularly, but you never paid him back. I promised to repay him later. When I could afford it. There are more things I want to ask you. Please come with us to the police station. Ah... yes. Could you wait outside for a minute? Yes, sure. You didn't tell them anything, did you? I didn't. You must never! - He... - Shut up! Zip your mouth! We can't live like this anymore for mere money! Mere money? Do you want to live on the streets? You don't know how hard it is to raise you alone... Ms. YANG Mi-sook! Attention! - Salute! - Thank you, teacher. - Young-eun, let's go to a karaoke. - OK. Let's go! I'm so tired! Happy Birthday. And thank you as always. With the rooftop garden finished, construction is now complete. Building A will be a shopping arcade, and Building B will feature theaters and... Buyers' itinerary is confirmed. Dinner starts at 7 pm at Chosun Hotel. Good. When are they leaving? They'll take the 17:00 flight tomorrow. - Make sure nothing goes wrong. - Yes, sir. And... While contracting Miss YOO's shop, I noticed something strange. Something strange? She was adopted. Did you know? Miss YOO! Where should I put this? Follow me. Leave it here for now. Hello. When will the signboard be ready? OK. Please finish it before opening day. Seung-jo! Well, do you like it? I'm afraid this is too much for a novice like me. But you majored in fashion design. Yes, but that was ages ago. Wouldn't a small boutique be better? Leave it to me, don't worry. I don't know how I'll pay you back. Just say Thank you. It's sunny today. Would you like some more coffee? Yes. Are you OK? I'm fine. Isn't it your birthday today? This is new. Let me know if you want something. Anything is okay. I've never seen her before. Ah... you've never seen her... Sorry for asking again, but what TV show were you watching then? Animal World. What was it about? It was about a monkey carrying her dead baby for days. A monkey carrying... Tae-ho. Sorry about this. Then, was there anyone else in the house? Hello. Dad's working now. Christmas present? Ask Santa Claus for it. A bicycle? OK. Let's talk about it later. Gone with the Wind Can I come in? Wow! Did you make this? It's amazing. I'm really sorry about your dad. What's your name? W"Y do you ask? Tell me your name. KIM Yo-han. Yo-han... Yo-han, do you like "Animal World?" You watched it with your mom and uncle Jae-doo the other night, didn't you? Yes. It was about a monkey carrying her dead baby for days. Did your mom or uncle go outside during the show? No. Well... Uncle Jae-doo... Your partner's calling you. Oh, okay. Yo-han, I promise to catch the murderer. Did you do as we practiced? Nice shot! CHO Min-woo! I heard you went up against Goldfish. No matter how much you hate him, he's your senior. Show him some respect. KIM Si-who murder case What the...? West-Incheon Police... HAN Dong-$00 SUH Hae-young KANG Jae-doo's dead? Yes, ma'am. Murdered? It's too early to conclude. I'm not surprised. He has enemies everywhere. May I ask you about the case 14 years ago? Be my guest. When you get old, you like to talk about the old days. Did you know your husband was having an affair with YANG Mi-sook? I didn't. Even if I did, there was nothing I could do. After your husband's death, you lived with KANG Jae-doo for a while, right? I was young then. Did you meet YANG Mi-sook afterward? No. She was gone already. Tell me about your son, KIM Yo-han. Is it a Christian name? Did he like his father a lot? Yes... KIM Si-who... He knew how to control kids. I see. Could I have Yo-han's number? I don't have it. I haven't heard from him since he left me during high school. Haven't you looked for him? No. I'm not a good mother. I think I've told you enough. See him to the door. - Fucking prove it! - Let me go! Sit down, for fuck's sake! - Fucking prove I put in the drug! - I saw it, fucker! Don't you fucking touch me! Yo-han! Yo-han... Yo-han... When are you going to stop living like shit? I swear I didn't use the drug! I would be crazy to. Shit... Wanna die? Go back and straighten things out. That bitch is in the same business as me. We're the same kind... I'll clean it up. Leave it to me. Get going. See ya. What do you want? Please open the door of my house. Your mom's not home? Out drinking again? Wait a second. It's freezing cold. Jesus, almost every time... Your mom's such trouble! I'll tell her to move out sooner or later. She should be ashamed of herself. What the hell is this smell? Hey! Hey. wake up! Open your eyes! My God! Is my mom... dead? Is she... really dead? Huh? Did you find anything? Nothing much. Too many suicides these days. Why did she take a cold pill? She was going to die anyway. She might not have killed herself. Dong-soo! What? Look at this. The prime suspect of the recent murder case committed suicide after being investigated... Dong-soo. Let it go. The case is over. By the way, what happened to the girl? - Jia? - Yes. I heard her aunt took her to Seoul. Order some more. Dong-soo. What is nagging at you? Did you see her eyes? Her eyes? Not once did she side with her mother. Come to think of it, you're right. Hey, HAN Dong-soo! Enough about the case! Stop talking crazy. It's solved. Let's celebrate! All right. Yeah, let it go and let's study for the promotion exam! You still dream of becoming police chief? How can I give it up? You'll see! If you're police chief, I'd be the head of the National Police. I don't know why people commit suicide. Same here. A drink and a smoke are enough to make me happy. - Why kill yourself? - Let's smoke to that. Give me one. Please stop bumming cigarettes. So what? So, I mean... I want to check a few more things. What if it turns out to be an accident? If it was an accident, the stew would've boiled over. But look at this. It's obvious it didn't. The money-lender was murdered! And the borrower killed herself! And the two of them were having an affair. Isn't it clear enough? But YANG Mi-sook might've been killed. There was no way for her get out from the ship. Then, how do you explain the lighter found in her house? The case is closed! But, sir, intuition tells me... Fuck intuition! Fuck! If you don't approve my re-investigation, I'll report it to the upper... What the fuck? You son of a bitch!! Fuck... You'll see who's fucking right! Hey, Min-jae. Come over here. We agreed on this. You'll keep the promise? Of course I will. If you help me just once, I'll buy you a bicycle. Come here. Over here. Not too bad, huh? I'll hold this flashlight for you. Help me just once. It's too dark. I'll keep flashing the light down here. Lower your head, Min-jae. Be careful! Are you okay? Yes. Would I be able to go down, too? No. It's too narrow for you. When you get to the bottom, wave your arms. OKay. My son's a good boy. Bicycle! Don't forget it! Don't worry. Min-jae! You want to ask me about Mi-ho? I understand you disapprove of my work. But, becoming the wife of a conglomerate big shot is not a personal matter. According to what I've investigated so far, she seems to be highly qualified. Sure. She's more than perfect. I see. Thank you for your time. Guys were following her around all the time. During college, there was a small incident. She was stalked. Yes. I'll wait in the car then. Who is it? Ah, Young-eun. She wants me to come home early. She still seems uncomfortable with me. She's going through puberty, you know. Give her more time. During the past 2 weeks, YOO Mi-ho kept a regular schedule. On Mon, Wed, and Fri, she goes to her shop after school Not even a speck of dust can be found. She meets you on Tue and Thu, and on weekends she meets college friends or visits her aunt in Yang-pyung. I saw two men approach her, but she turned them down immediately. Not even a speck of dust can be found. What about the stalker? I'm still investigating. How sly a man is... When I knew nothing, she was an absolute angel. But now I feel distant from her even when she's in my arms. I even come to doubt if she really loves me. Find out everything about that stalker. I want to get rid of this filthy feeling. Yes, sir. Are you KIM Yo-han? What can I do for you? You know KANG Jae-do? KANG... Jae... doo... He used to work for my family years ago. He's dead. Relax. I'm just trying to get information. I already met SUH Hae-young. Last Wednesday, where were you between 4 and 6 am? People usually sleep at that time. Yes... that's true. May I ask about the murder case 14 years ago? Please don't get offended. I'm asking because he was one of the suspects then. It's something I don't want to think about. Would you please leave now? Ouch! It must sting every time you wash your face. If you change your mind, Please call me. LORO... KIM Yo-han... Excuse me. I'm looking for Detective HAN Dong-soo. You should check out the restroom. Detective HAN? West-Incheon Police, Detective HAN Dong-soo, right? I'd like to ask you a few things. KANG Jae-doo is dead. Do you remember him? He was working for KIM Si-who who was murdered on the abandoned ship 14 years ago. I really need your help. Please... I'm begging you. I heard you dug deep into the case for 2 more years after your son's accident. Then you got suspended and divorced. Got a cigarette? I don't smoke. Autopsy results haven't come out yet, but my gut tells me he was murdered. One of the suspects of a 14-year-old case dies just before the statute of limitations runs out. Doesn't that tell you something? I've been watching KIM Yo-han. I believe you know KIM Yo-han's mother and KANG Jae-doo were having an affair. Diabetes... It's a nasty disease. To survive, you must poke yourself with a needle before every meal. Detective HAN! Don't indulge in sweets too much. If you change your mind, please call me. And for your information, this is where KIM Yo-han works. Could you take Young-eun home? Yes, of course. Miss YOO! Let's go for a drive. Yes, Si-young. Care for some music? Stop being pretentious. My dad's not here. Why do you hate me so much? Do you know what they call you at school behind your back? Parent-eater! Everyone knows you dated Ji-soo's father last year. I should've known better when you were so nice to me for no reason. Aren't you tired of smiling like that all the time? Hello. I'd like to speak to Detective CHO Min-woo. May I ask who's calling? I'm Detective HAN Dong-soo from West-Incheon Police Station. Ah, you're his colleague? The y just began searching his house. His house? For what? Haven 't you heard? He's been missing for about a week. We don't know exactly when he disappeared, but... Please take good care of Kyung-ho. It's been a long time. Yeah... I had a good rest. I was tired of being hated. I didn't like you, but didn't hate you either. It's amazing how you changed this place. Is it for your dead husband? Let bygones be bygones. I don't understand why you're still here like this. I didn't know you loved him so much. That night. You said you watched "Animal World" with Yo-han, right? Can't you come up with a new question? You must be itching to tell the truth by now. Get lost. - Isn't it about time to tell the truth? - I said get lost! By the way, Yo-han... looks very much like you now. What's wrong? Bad dream? No. Go back to sleep. Why do you love me? Hmm... Because you're rich? Frank answer, I like that. How much money do you need? Enough to protect me... Enough to prevent me from getting hurt again. Yes. Arrest? I can't talk now. We'll continue tomorrow in my office. Sorry that you came all the way here. OK. Bye. They're working late. Try not to work too hard. KIM Yo-han Why is a detective following YOO Mi-ho? Let go of me! KIM Yo-han? Who the hell are you? I saw you sitting near YOO Mi-ho at the coffee shop today and saw you again in front of her apartment. Is this YOO Mi-ho? She's being harassed by a stalker, so I suspected you as one. But you could also be a stalker. How do you know YOO Mi-ho? Uncuff me first, Detective. Hold on! She's my boss's fiancee. So you're secretly investigating her to see if she fits the position? It's like selecting an employee. Financial status... Educational background... Criminal record... LEE Jia's name changed to YOO Mi-ho... LEE Jia... Hey! Here he is. He's a chronic offender. Arrested for another case, he's in detention now. Wrong person? What was the name again? - MIN Kyung-ho. - Not him. KIM Yo-han? He was the witness in the attempted rape case MIN Kyung-ho was convicted for. Initial witness KIM Yo-han - and YOO Mi-ho... - MIN Kyung-ho is in Young-deung-po prison. HONG Yun-mi... I don't know her. How did you get her photos then? I found dozens of photos of a naked woman in my mailbox. What would you do with them? But there was a witness. - A witness? - Yes. I didn't fucking do it! I don't know her at all. Good-bye. - Open the door! - Hey, MIN Kyung-ho. Why did you follow YOO Mi-ho around? Is love a sin? You people don't know true love. You sound like a stalker. Stalker? Bullshit! The real stalker was someone else. - Do you remember his face? - Of course. He's not as handsome as me. - Hello! - Oh, Hi! You must be tired from all the work. Both of them were my students. The murderer's daughter and the victim's son were in the same class. - How were they before the incident? - They were quite close... But after the incident... To Yo-han, it must've been a torture to see the daughter of his father's murderer everyday. But he never showed his anger or hatred to Jia. When Jia decided to move to Seoul, I felt so relieved. I should've been a better teacher. Yes, Si-young. I'm OK. Tell me. So... there is no stalker now. No, sir. But she even changed her name... That's not your concern. Just do your job. Mr. Park, could you turn up the volume? Seung-jo! Seung-jo! Sir, are you OK? Hold on to me. You didn't come again? How is it with her? It's OK. You satisfied me anyway. Tell me what you want. I'll give anything you want. I want to walk... What? I want to walk... under the Sun. - What was the cause of the accident? - It's under investigation. Mr. Park said the brakes suddenly didn't work. If it's all right, I have something to tell you. Is it about Mi-ho? Yes, sir. To be honest with you I ordered her to spy on you. Aren't you upset? I had a feeling you would do that. But now... why are you telling me? If there's anything I still don't know about you, I want to hear it directly from you. To begin with... I should tell you what happened to my mom 14 years ago. - What a lovely flower! - My daughter raised it. After my husband and Mi-ho died in a car accident, I picked up the work I had done before marriage to forget everything and start over. You came alone? You promised to teach me how to make clothes. My life was meaningless. Then, she came along. Does this look fun? Yes. I'd love to learn. What for? I want to make clothes with my hands for someone special in the future. It was like my Mi-ho had come back alive. Jia Can I call you Mi-ho from now on? Then, I'll call you Mom. That's how my name changed. Well... What now? I'm the daughter of a murderer... Should we stop seeing each other? Let's get married. You've done enough. You can stop investigating. Yes, sir. I'll contact you if needed. Get some rest. Are you satisfied? Finally you've got what you wanted. Young-eun... I'll never accept you as my mother. I must've kept you very busy. Can you meet me? I have something to ask about YOO Mi-ho, and also something to return. OK. We should stop here. It's getting dangerous. For who? For you. Is it because of KIM Yo-han? Then, I'll find out by myself. Let's go for another round. Impressive! How long did you investigate the case? About 2 years? Do you think Yo-han has something to do with this old murder case? Well, it's only a hunch. What is this? Is this a part of the evidence? It's useless now. It's more like a charm to me. - Then what makes you believe... - 14 years ago, I found this at the crime scene. Yo-han, come eat dinner! I told you I'd be recording. What about it? Mom, I'm recording a song! 14 years ago, on December 19, there was a huge fire at the Incheon port around 7 pm. The murder took place around .9. It means the murderer was at the scene after 7. Only a kid could enter and leave that place. There is a quote that cops like. "If you don't get an answer after every possible reasoning, the answer is likely to be the simplest thing." You mean... KIM Yo-han is... I found this sound two years after the case had been closed. It was no use. What was the reason? Shouldn't you ask Yo-han that? No, I mean the reason you stuck to this case. That' what I want to ask you. Why are you so interested? I just... I'm worried about my boss. Let's have a drink, and organize the data. Did you have dinner? Sir! Sorry for the long wait. I'm not supposed to give you this information, but this is an exception because you're Min-woo's friend. Was it a suicide or murder? An unknown epithelial cell was taken from KANG Jae-doo's fingernails. - Male with blood type AB. - AB? Yes. We're going through the list of ex-convicts, but we haven't found a match yet. Who'll take care of the flowers now? I will. Although I won't be able to visit every month. No, don't bother. Do you still participate in the weekend mission activities? Of course. It's the joy of my life. We're going to Busan this time, so it'll take a few days. They are regular guys. I don't think you'll find anything special. Wait... Why is he opening the hood? That's a bit strange... How do you feel? - Like the world is under my feet? - You're really amazing. You've already achieved everything in your 20s. I really envy you. The bright sunlight seems to shine on you. The sun never existed in my life. All I had was a thin ray of light. It wasn't as bright as the sun, but it was bright enough. What was this ray of light? Opening on December 19th, the day the statute of limitations expires. - Hello. - The accident was a set-up. A small explosive device was found in the car. What? Where are you now? I'm on my way to your house. Wait for me inside. I have to stop by somewhere. - The key's in the pot. - Got it. - Chief PARK Tae-ho... Dong-soo, when will you stop? I'm sorry, but this is my last request. Extracting DNA from Yo-han will be the end of... Come on! It's not even my district. If something goes wrong, I'm the one who's responsible! I can no longer watch your back. This was all in the past. So please stop. What did you say? All in the past? Stop? How can I stop? How dare you tell me to stop! You're no better than the others, asshole! Dong-soo... It really hurts to hear that. I'm sorry, Tae-ho. But I'll have to stop soon anyway. What are you talking about? Tae-ho, I can see only half of your face now. Where's KIM Yo-han? Why are you asking me? Don't you get it? The DNA from KANG Jae-doo's fingernails is the same as Yo-han's. It's your son's DNA! Why are you so obsessed with this case? Do you know how to ride a bicycle? I have yet to learn. I thought I could learn to whenever I wanted. Now I have a bicycle and plenty of time, but my son's gone forever. There are things you can only do at certain times in your life. He crossed the line. Now we must stop him. I don't know what you mean. Would you please go? Good morning! - Oh, how are you feeling? - Much better. - Take care. - Thanks. Murderer's Daughter! YOO Mi-ho '5 mother is a killer! Suicide of a key suspect Don't come to me. Stop right there! Stay where you are. I can't do this. Everything will be fine after this. Mi-ho. I'll meet a lawyer soon after I get married. If you wait a bit more, we can be together. Jia! My name is YOO Mi-ho. Do you call this a brighter future? Don't you know what this means to me? I can't give up... yet. It'll destroy our future. Jia, let's just run far away from here. Why is mere money so important? Mere money? I lived in hell because of that mere money. For our future I even killed my mother. This is the last thing we need to go through. Who is it? Dad? Who is it? I don't regret it. I'll tell your dad you caught a cold. Don't worry. It'll be our little secret. - Why didn't you answer my calls? - Ah... I'm sorry. I lost my cell phone. Where's Young-eun? She's got a cold. She's resting in her room. You don't look well, either. I'm OK. How sick is she? I'll go to her. It's a good opportunity to get closer to her. This is the first time you called me first. I watched "Animal World" a million times. The episode you watched with Yo-han that day. Did I? I thought you lied about the monkey, but they were really carrying the dead babies. So stupid... And don't they look like us? Where was Yo-han on that day 14 years ago? I think KANG Jae-doo went to see Yo-han after he was released from jail. Yo-han, be careful not to get caught. The statute will expire soon, right? I happened to see her in a magazine. She grew up very pretty. YOO Mi-ho? I almost didn't recognize her because of her new name. It was the next day when I found out my husband had died. Don't move! Keep your mouth shut forever. Otherwise, you'll regret it. It depends on you. Take the pawnshop. Just keep your mouth shut. You promise? By the way, didn't Kim Si-who go to meet that girl? He was with YANG Mi-sook's daughter. My husband... had abnormal tastes. Only young girls could satisfy him. Get out. Leave me alone! Is this how he attacked you? Does it recur to you whenever you close your eyes? Don't turn away. Look at me. The harder you try to forget it, the more it'll consume you. The pain and the memory will haunt you for the rest of your life. From now on, whenever it occurs to you, remember this moment and my body. Instead of him, think of me holding you now. Much worse things happened to me when I was younger than you. My mother... sold me to a monster. That monster... ripped me up and devoured me. I was tortured and destroyed every single day. You've become the young me of the past. Poor thing... Don't be afraid. I promise to protect you. I knew it from the beginning. Please understand because I'm his mother. Detective HAN! Please catch Yo-han. Stop! Yo-han... You were not here today. I... I killed my dad... Countless times... I wanted to kill him myself. So I would have killed him one day if you hadn't. So it's me who killed him. We shouldn't see each other any more. I read it from a book that any sin can be forgiven in 15 years. Yo-han... We shouldn't meet until then. Mom, if we get a chance, let's have a drink. Don't worry. Sure. Don't say that. You have to help me pick a wedding dress. That's so sweet of you. I'll let you go. You must be busy. Take good care. Bye. I'm sorry, but we're not open... YOO Mi-ho? Who are you? LEE Jia. Where's Yo-han? What? KANG Jae-doo was murdered. And two people who chased Yo-han are missing. Jia... I know what happened to you two that day. Please excuse me. I'm very busy. Yo-han is still trapped in that miserable ship! You're the only one who can save him. I don't know what you're talking about. Would you please leave? Mi-ho... On that day What if I just turned a blind eye? What if I didn't like you? What if we didn't know each other? Jia... The future you always talk about... I'm not sure what it is yet. But I'll protect you until the end. One missed call So they've been trying to hide it all these years? First of all, we must catch Yo-han. So I need your help. What's with the bicycle all of a sudden? You are half blind. Tae-ho Mi-ho's shop opens on December 19. It's the day when it all began 14 years ago. The statute of limitations? But it doesn't apply to them anymore. Well, it's a special day to them. You mean KIM Yo-han will be there? They are like a Siamese twins who can't live without each other no matter how painful it is. You changed.. You used to treat murderers as beasts. Tae-ho, we've got to stop them.
