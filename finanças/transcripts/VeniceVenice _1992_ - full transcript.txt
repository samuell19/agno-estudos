I'm very much a romantic, and movies since the time I was five years old have had a tremendous effect on my dreams. In the movies there was always an answer to every question. I mean, when you were there it gave you this illusion that anything could happen. Movies made me think, like, there would never be a down time in a relationship. People meet and they fall in love and they break up and they get back together again. I always thought that I would end up getting married really early on. I wanted to come home and have the perfect Martinis and the perfect child and a witty, roguish, ridiculous man. When I was a little girl I used to sit in front of the TV all the time watching musicals. And it was my expectation of life that I would just be happy, that nothing bad would ever happen, that any problems I would encounter would resolve magically. I just expected that I'd be taken care of and life would be beautiful. Do you want some more tea? Excuse me. Just one second, okay? - Sure. - No, I'm fine. The papers you were supposed to give me. - Okay. Oh, the papers are here. - Yeah. This is all yours. They all want interviews. I don't know what they are. You know, you figure out what... Sweden and Germany and Radio Publica y Cineforme. - France? - France, nothing. - France, nothing? - No. Take this for me. Hey, Jesus Christ. Excuse me. - What? - Did you want more tea? Did you say you wanted more tea? No, no. Excuse me, I gotta do an interview. Okay, I'll be right back. What can I do for you? Excuse me, I have my breakfast. Now, you're not shooting this, are you? - I'm just eating. - Well, of course we're shooting it. - That's how TV crews are. - All right. That's what happens when one is the only - representative of a big film country. - Yeah. Your film is the only American film in the official selection. In America the idea of my being official is a joke. I'm very much a maverick in America. I make small films about human relationships, not big films to sell popcorn. I don't understand representing America, I don't understand being official. I am the representative of, if anything, of the anti-establishment, so I don't understand how I come to represent America here. I think just somebody by accident had a piece of good taste and, um, and chose my film. But I'm totally stunned that this little movie should represent America at a festival like this. Okay, so, um, what is this about again? What's the name of the magazine? - It's a cinema magazine. - Uh-huh. And what kind of magazine is it? It's a magazine about cinema. Does it mean that you have to jump around and give a lot of interviews? Yes, there's a lot more press when you're official than when you're unofficial, that's absolutely true. That's what it really means. All it means is that I'm getting a lot more attention. Which I like. Which means I will expand a little bit, the base of my audience. But Europeans have always been quite sympathetic to my films. It's the Americans that I have trouble with. - Be very quick, okay? - Okay. Well, I don't need much time. He's very polite and he won't, you know, he won't tell you to leave so you've got to leave because we have a meeting at the Excelsior, okay? - Okay, fine. - Okay. When is that? Just after he's finished that? Just after he finishes. - Okay. - Okay? - But I'm serious, be very quick. - Okay. We don't have much time. Very important interviews. Thank you very much. It seems to me that a movie only exists once you have the images. A smile, a moment, a tear, a laugh, a piece of music, an emotion, a look between two people. Those are the things that makes a movie a movie. I can't know what those are until I get them. So I encourage my actors to give me everything they can in the basic thematic area that I'm looking at, in the theme that I'm trying to deal with. And then later, in the editing room I take those pieces and I juxtapose them as best I can and I try to find out what my story is. - Dean? - What is it? I'm sorry, just one second. What are you doing? I'm in the middle of an interview. - They want to see you at the Excelsior... - Fine. - ...so we have to leave in 20 minutes. - Not now. Okay. Not now, Eve. Come on. - They're coming with a car. - Good. Fine, yes. No, don't... What do you mean should I call a car? - Because we have to... - Get out of here. - What do you mean a cab? - We have to get a cab. - For what time? - We gotta be at the Excelsior in 20 minutes. So don't panic, would you, please? Can I finish? Excuse me. I'm very sorry. - What should I tell them? - I'll tell you afterwards. No more discussion, please. Thank you. I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. - You were filming her? Oh, that's very smart. So you're going to show what a horrible person I really am. This is for German television, right? I can assure you, this was the most funniest interview I've ever made. Well, thank you very much. Thank you, that's very nice. I appreciate it. - Thank you very much. Bye. - Thanks. Eve? Yes. Pull up a chair. Okay, what's going on? What is on the agenda here? - Okay. - Okay. Who's that young woman in the red? French magazine, she wants to do an interview. - What magazine? - I don't know, I never heard of it. Some French movie magazine. Well, I'll talk to her. - But we have to go to the Excelsior. - No, I wanna... Why? I've just ordered a car because we have a meeting there. - Thank you very much, yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Nice seeing you. - We have a meeting there. - What kind of a meeting? With an Italian magazine. A very important magazine. She came from Paris to talk to me? They're waiting there for us. Yeah. - Well, I don't know, I mean, they're waiting for us. - Let me... Okay, I'll just talk to her for two minutes and then... and then we'll go. - Two minutes, then I'm gonna come and get you. - Okay. Two minutes. Okay? Okay. Hi, Mr. Dean. My name is Jeanne Marie. Hi. Thank you very much for giving me some time. What is that weird sound, the clanking? Oh, that's the wind in the awning. Yeah. I couldn't shoot a movie here. I've got only a few minutes. What do you want to know? Well, the first thing is that, what are you doing here? - Is this working? - Yeah. I hope so. Yeah. You know what I'm doing here. I have a film in the competition. I know that... I know that, but, um... I'm here to do publicity, to talk to people like yourself about the film. Yeah, what I mean is that, what I like most about your films I guess, is, uh, how you deal with reality and how, you know, you don't do all that kind of Hollywood thing. And then... It's a little strange for me because I just arrived here and it seems you're enjoying all that stuff. You know what I mean? No, what do you mean? I mean this is... As far... It's beautiful here. You mean, I'm not supposed to be enjoying it here? I don't know. I didn't imagine you would enjoy that. Why? It's as far as reality as you can be. It's as far as reality? As far from reality as you can be. Oh. Oh, yeah, sure. Well, that's part of its charm. I mean, it's a film festival and it's Venice and it's beautiful and... So, um... You mean, I'm supposed to be somebody who doesn't like... - What? - I don't know. You have a little, uh... bit of coffee there. So, um, despite the fact that you're making movies that are very much off-Hollywood and you're still enjoying the whole glamor and the Hollywood... Glamor? No, this is not glamor. I'm enjoying the game, I'm enjoying talking to people and meeting people from different countries who are interested in film. Why am I being put on the defensive? You feel there's something wrong with me? - No, tell me the truth. - Absolutely not. I get a feeling from you that there's something I'm not supposed to be doing here. I... - No, no, no. I was... - What do you mean? I'm sorry. This is a very unusual interview, you know. I'm sorry, I didn't plan to ask that. No, it's okay. It's fine. I'm shaking. - Why? You nervous? - Yeah. I'm very impressed being here. You're impressed being here in Venice? I'm impressed meeting you. Why? Because I like your movies and I have the feeling... Because I've seen you in your movies, and I know you a little bit and you don't know me, so it's a little strange. Oh, I see. Relax, take it easy. It's very nice being asked these questions and told that I shouldn't be having a good time here. I'd say both. I mean, some people say great stage actors are no good on film, but I enjoy filming mainly because it's, you know, so different from the theater. 'Cause the concentration is like, you have to... You break concentration up right into a tiny moment, whereas in the theater it... Hold on just one second, okay? I'll be right back. You like the... I like the intensity of it, you know, the intensity of, uh, you know, even if you just have to go to a door, open a door and go "hello." You know, you just have to think that. You know, you never have to do anything like that on stage. You know? It's a completely different energy. Hi. I knew, I knew you were here. Hi. Excuse me, I'm very sorry. An old friend. What are you doing here? Well, I'm doing, I'm... You're doing press, too. I'm over there. - I'll see you right afterwards. - Okay, great. - Really nice to see you. - Oh, I'm real excited to see you. - Excuse me, I'm sorry. - Bye. Excuse me. Do you know him? Dean, of course. - Yeah. - Feels good. You see what I mean? We all meet each other at the film festival... Amazing. Nice to see him. You haven't seen each other in a while? Not for a while, no. Uh, what about, uh, this film again is a period piece. I'm sorry, excuse me, I saw an old friend. I remember her from your movie. Oh, yeah? You saw it? Sure. I loved it. - She's a good actress. - Yeah. I didn't know she was gonna be here. Oh. You were very much in love with her. In the movie. At least in the movie, yeah. Um, people are accusing you all of the time- Where are you from? Paris. Why? People are accusing me of what? Um, how do you say... Do you know French a little? Nombrilisme, we say that, you know, when you... Nombrilisme. Nombrilism? - You don't say "Nombrilism"? - No. We don't say "Nombrilism" that I know. How do you say, "Nombrilisme"? You know, when you look here. Here. - Belly button? - Belly button. Very cute belly button. Yes, so people accuse you of looking at your belly button, - you say that? - Yes. "Self-indulgence" it's called in English. Yes. - Okay, self-indulgence... - Oh, I see, yes. ...all the time and, um, I think they're wrong, of course. Thank you. I really mean it. I can see that you really mean it and I appreciate that. Okay, I canceled all the appointments. I canceled lunch, I canceled. - Is there anything else? - Have you two met? - Yeah. - Yeah, hi. We've met. I brought her to you. Hmm. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. The other thing, I have two things to ask you. First of all... I'm doing an interview right now. - Okay. - I'm sorry. No, no. It's okay, I mean, I just... Yeah? You know, you've missed three interviews so far, and this afternoon we have La Republica. He's a good friend of mine and I can't do this to him, so if you can't make it at five o'clock this afternoon you've got to tell me, that's all. Okay. No, no. Five o'clock is plenty of time, I'll make it. And the other thing is I want to know if, um, I can go to the pool because if I have nothing else to do now then I'd like to take a swim. Sure, go ahead to the pool. We'll talk a little more. You need a little more? Yeah, uh, what I need... I need photos. You have photos? Well, she takes care of all of that. - Okay. - I'll talk to you about them, sure. You need color photos? - Yes, for the magazine. - We don't have that many. We have the slides, don't we? Don't we have the slides? - Do we have the slides? - We have the slides. So you can have a selection of slides. Sure. - Anything you want. - Thank you very much. Can I go to the pool? - Yeah. Everything else is okay? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, sure. - Okay. Thanks. She's very helpful, she's very good. - She's been with me for about a year and a half now. - Mm-hmm. Speaks Italian fluently, which helps a lot. Good translator, you know. Excuse me, please. I need to bother you for a moment. I think I saw you in a movie here. You were really wonderful. Oh, thank you very much. - Sisters, wasn't it? - Yes. Thank you. - It was great. - Thank you. I'm glad you liked it. Would you like anything, sir? Oh, no. We had enough, I think. Do you want something? - No, I'm fine. - No. Do you guys have any pictures with you? I have little passport photos that I'm handing out as PR pictures. We have pictures. - You have pictures. - You should give them to me. You guys should be trying to do some interviews. Italian high school student newspapers want to know if I've ever had a drink with Rob Lowe, Charlie Sheen... Are you serious? She said there are difficulties with the language. She asks you not to answer too briefly. You are the only American film in competition. Do you feel representative of the American cinema today? Absolutely not. I am not representative of anything of the United States. I think they thought I was Steven Spielberg. You're very good at this. - Oui? - You are. Yeah. I don't know what you said so I'll have to wait. The American critics are accusing you of always making movies about yourself and focused on yourself. The way we experience the world is initially through ourselves. If we're not willing to admit that, we're not really looking at each other. Now bad narcissism is when you stop at only looking at yourself. Good narcissism is when you use your healthy initial self love to then turn it to somebody else and try to get a sense of who they are and being open to who they are because you have learned something about who you are. Otherwise I don't think you can love anybody else if you don't love yourself first. Does it sound like bullshit to you? No. I think it's actually very true. Pleased to meet you. All the big guys are here now. Xerox picture of me like this - I look like Casper the Friendly Ghost. - Please, please. Please have a good time, please. Please. Please? - It's not that easy. - Mm. It is. Kiss me. I know you want to get as much money as possible and I appreciate that, but at the same time I just want to make sure that finally a film of mine gets seen correctly and handled correctly and it's worth a certain amount. I hope you agree. You talk like the guy I'm going to meet tomorrow. Because I told him I would like to have you because you're the best distributor here. - Right. - And he can really guarantee a good release in Italy. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. So, good, but if you're asking too much money, then it becomes impossible. That's very Italian. You always ask for high ceiling... I understand but you... ...and then you can always come down. All I'm saying is it's very important that you also deal with the quality of the distribution. - It's as important for me. - That's what I have in mind. What do you want to do tonight? Go out to dinner or something? Hmm? Come on, have a good time. - I can't. - Oh, you can. - I can't. - You can. - What are you seeing? - An Israeli film. - Born in Jerusalem. - Uh-huh. Yeah. It's supposed to be good. Interesting. I read the screenplay. - Yeah? Okay. - Loved it. Yes. - Okay, see you around. - Okay, take care. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Enchante. - Nice to meet you. He's a nice man. It's a little different perspective on this whole thing. Yeah, well, it's funny. Never thought about you as a business man. I don't think of me very much as a business man either. No. Well, it's part of the work I guess. Don't sound so disappointed, I mean, it's a part of the work. Of course it's a part of the work. You know, you live a little bit maybe in a dream world. There's just some sort of... I do the best I can, but I have to deal with these realities of... Don't. I mean, you look so sad. I am? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to look sad. I don't know, maybe I'm sad a little bit. Yeah. Why are you sad? I don't know, it's like, because I should be happy and I'm just a little sad not being as happy as I should be. Probably. Something like that. You know when you're on a beautiful... You know, like, everything's perfect, and it's like, so it's perfect, so what? - Yeah, I know. - You know? I saw your movies. I felt very close to whatever person made them. And to you in a way, so I wanted to meet you. It's very flattering, you know, but it's not me. The movies are not real, they are something I invent. I mean, it's not about... That's not real life. It's like this is not real life, you know? This is some sort of a game people play about coming to a place and pretending that it's... You weren't pretending in your movies. - No, I... - That was your real feelings. - Yes, they are my real feelings. - I hope so. No, no, I'm not pretending in the movies but I'm not what you think I am, I may not be, because what I am in the movies is a synthesis of... I'm... I don't know why it worries me that you should think that I'm something other than what I am, but... I dunno, I don't know you, I just know your movies, that's right. But I don't think anyone can make movies like that without being what I think you should be. I don't know. You're very beautiful, you know that? - Thank you. - But that can be an illusion too. You can just seem to be beautiful but actually not be beautiful. And yet you seem very much to me to be beautiful at this moment. You mean inside I could be... - Who knows? - Who knows? This could be an illusion. - Mm-hmm. - Like a movie. Mm-hmm. The movies that I appreciated were ones that the man would come and sweep you off your feet and you'd be swept. Some man was gonna come along and wake me up and my real life would start at that moment. A man would just come right up to me and completely adore me, completely love me, for exactly who I was. When a man fell in love with a woman, that was it forever, and he would never stop running after her from the moment he met her. He'd solve all the problems and win all the awards and turn out great but be ridiculous the whole time. This handsome prince that rescued me from all drudgery and took me away and, um, took me to a castle on a hill somewhere. I really think that's gonna happen. - You're trembling, you've got goosebumps. - I'm cold. I'm cold. - Great legs. God, look at these legs. - Thank you. She likes being cold, it makes her nipples hard, they stand out. - Stop it. - You can see them from across the pool. - Stop. - Hi. - She says everything's okay. - Oh, good. - The Swedes loved you, you know. - They did? Swedish television gave you a review, they talked about Ursula Andress and so on. - They went nuts over you. - Congratulations. Yeah, they did. They really thought... Listen, I wanted to tell you something. - Said you were gonna be a big star in Sweden. - Really? - Dean, I have something important to tell you. - You hear that? Okay, anyway, the thing is... Dinner tonight, okay? Congratulations about the Swedes. We have to make reservations and we have to know how many people we're going to be... I think I wanna go and eat with her. I don't wanna go with you guys. - To come... What about the rest of us? - Not to come. I think you can make your own plans. You guys okay for dinner? - You can make your own plans? - Yeah. We all eat at the hotel. Everybody eats at the hotel. Well, I think I might go off and do an interview with this girl. - You have an interview with some people. - What do you mean? I mean, Channel Cinque. Channel Five, it's big here. I don't care about Channel Cinque, I'm busy tonight. Just tonight. I'll do everything tomorrow, I promise you. Try to arrange everything tomorrow, okay? - No, I wish you wouldn't do this during the trip. - I'm sorry. It's the wrong time for you to become social. Do me a favor. I'm not becoming social. I'm in the middle of an interview. She's asking very good questions. You could bring her with us, then. Okay, maybe I'll bring her with us. I'll try to do that. You guys are okay, huh? - Yes. - We're fabulous. Still reading, huh? Still wearing the same old hat. - Yeah. You look good. - So do you. - What's happening in London? - Oh, God. Weren't you doing a play? - Did you read about it? - Yeah. I walked out... I didn't walk out, I withdrew from it on Monday. What, in the west end? What was it? It was The Seagull. I was going to play Masha. Oh, my God. You're born to play Masha. No, no. I know... I know, but, um... It just didn't feel right, you know? - It didn't feel right. - You know, you always did this. What do you mean I always did this? I mean, it's not about feeling right always, is it? I mean... What do you mean it didn't feel right? You were gonna play Masha. No, what do you mean? Let's not... We shouldn't do this. I'm really happy to see you. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Who gave you that? Pretty, isn't it? - Yeah, it's very nice. - Yeah. A friend of mine gave it to me. You're tough, huh? Don't talk to me about... No, I won't. I'm not asking you anything. - You want to smoke, you can smoke. - Mmm. - I understand. I'm not saying a word. - Yeah, okay... You started it and asked me not to say it - and then I'm not saying it. - Yeah, I know. But I felt you looking. - But you're creating an argument. - No... - I'm not... Nothing, no problem. - No problem. Just get it out of my... Change hands for me. That's all I ask. Just change hands for me. - It's completely and utterly fascist. - I don't wanna... Look... - I know, you're American... - Oh, come on. He always does this. You know, you're the star of this movie and I don't know... He's treating Lauren so nicely. He's giving her attention, you know, - you should really stand up for yourself. - Figure that out. - Stand up for myself? - He always favors women. You know, that's how he is. That's the way he is. He likes women. You know, apart from me, he favors every other woman. He thinks they're all wonderful. And you should really tell him you know, you want, you know, you want coverage, you want press. - She's nice, isn't she? I just met her. - You really like her, don't you? - I just met her. - I know you. - She likes me. But it's not me... - Oh, oh, oh. - You are so arrogant. - ...she likes my movies. - It's not arrogant. - That is such an arrogant thing to say. "She likes me." She's a little obsessed with my movies. - Oh, I see. That's... And you respond to that. - She doesn't und... I am subjective enough to care for that, yes, but I at the same time recognize the difference and I'm trying to let her know that it's not me she's responding to, but... That's big of you. At the same time she's very attractive, - interesting and bright, really bright. - Yeah. Yeah. But she's into a fantasy about me and I have to... You have to go and fulfill the fantasy. No, just the opposite. I don't wanna do that now. - No. Okay. - I got to her to know I'm not who she thinks I am. - Yeah. - Which is hard to do when I want to be who she thinks I am. That's good, that's really good. That's good. You work with him and you have to just take those rules. Those are the rules. Those aren't my rules. Okay. You did this film, you know... This film is working because I'm in it. Not because he stood behind a camera and said - you know... - Well, you don't know that. - "Wear a different shirt." - You don't know how he does his stuff. Can't stand that guy. I'm gonna be 30 years old soon. It's unbelievable that he's got me here. - Well... - Unbelievable he's got me here wasting my life by this fucking pool. Yeah, your movie... A little bit. Yeah. Why are you here really? I have a feeling there's a whole other thing going on. I don't understand what's going on exactly. You're not writing now, you're not taping now. - That's right. - Why? Why do you know so much about me? Because I've seen your movies. You learn a lot about you when you see your movies. Yeah, but why is it so important? The reason why I'm here I would say is movies are very important in my life, you know. The dream of romance in movies was about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and perfection. Nobody ever had to repeat themselves. Nobody ever had to rephrase themselves. Nobody ever had to bang their head against a wall to get understood. They met and they fell in love or there may have been difficulties and in the end they fell in love, but it gave me the hope that there would be something and that maybe some day I would experience that. When I think about movies and how they made impressions on me when I was younger I think about Doris Day and Rock Hudson. 'Cause I think about how they used to behave towards each other and how perfect Doris Day was in her "dealing with" her man. The heroic "I'm gonna make it work," "I can make it work," you know? "I'll find the right man," and, you know, "we'll have babies," I don't know. Whatever. Even when they fought they fought with sort of, um, kind of, witty banter instead of, instead of raising their voices. They're always bickering but everything turns out perfect in the end. You get married, you live happily ever after. The end. Credits roll. I want to go home. Stop. They're only interested in Dean, Dean... There's directors here, - auteurs, oeuvres. - Stop. Please. - It's a Mickey Mouse festival. - Come on, Dylan. Let's go into Venice tonight. Can I have the butter please? - Here we are, maestro. - Here we are. You had some movie that was considered a cult movie. - A cult movie? - That's right. I am curious about your definition of... Those are just words people use. I have no idea what they mean. My impression is that you get more involved in the roles. If you'd do your job instead of worrying about what you're eating... I don't understand what the man just said. - I thought we were having lunch. - I'm sorry, but she's supposed... - I always like to teach them what to do. - That's offensive. Dean, would you like to know the question? I think if you do your job I'll find out what the question is. He wants to know why you give women so much importance in your films and really ignore men? - All your films. - All my films? Because I think women are more true. I think you can learn much more about emotional reality from women. I think what women deal with is their feelings and if you try to make films about emotions and about feelings and if you try to really look at what we're going through emotionally in life, uh, I think if you look through female characters you're much more likely to get close to the truth. Because women are much more truthful about what they're feeling. - So, I feel that... Do you understand? Did he... - Yes. Oh, is this your mic? I'm sorry. Am I speaking into it okay? - Yeah. - So I just feel that it's very important to try to get to the emotional truth and you can't get to the emotional truth through men because they hide it so you can show the way men hide all the time from what they're really feeling. But with women you can explore some internal reality. It's not about, you know, everything outside of themselves. They're not terrified of looking at the confusions and complications of their lives. Goddammit, I asked for water with no gas in it. That's just got... That's the one with no gas. Are you getting what you need also? Or do you have any questions at the same time with your tape recorder? I'm happy to do both. I'm used to this, and eating, and thinking about the next movie, you know? Do you really think about movies? Always. It's very hard to think my real life exists independent of movies. It's very hard to believe that anything is really happening if these tape recorders aren't here or if a movie camera isn't somewhere. It's, um... It's some neurotic attachment to having every moment captured in life. Then I can be sure at least that it's happening and I can look at it on my machine and try to reorganize it. It makes you feel like your life is a movie. Oh, the question is whether there's something like real life? And if that real life is something independent of a movie. I mean, when you make a movie you're clearly making something that is not real. But is this more real because there's not a-a camera somewhere shooting it? You're an actor, and as an actor don't you feel a little more authentically real when you're on camera? Absolutely, yes. The moment the film runs out, I feel less authentically real. And that's what's very hard to explain to non actors. That's what makes us crazy in a certain kind of way. Because there's something so heightened by being... This is actually answering you. We all feel... We really feel that when we are on camera, we know that there is a reality going on that will be captured. - And therefore it intensifies the moment, right? - Absolutely. In some way that makes you feel that it's more important than a moment in life. If that moment will reverberate for the rest of your life, it'll be there... You maybe want to translate. - Do you understand "reverberate"? - Yeah. - Through your life. - It's our postcard to posterity. "It's our postcard to posterity," how very poetic, Alexander, that's lovely. Our postcard to posterity. It's a good title for a movie. It's a question of when you're observing something, whether you can observe it without changing it. It's the same in physics, when you observe phenomenon it changes it. - Really? - You modify, yeah. I don't know... How do you know about physics? I studied physics. When you observe particles, when you observe it, it makes it happen in a way. Yes, Schroedinger's cat is all about it. - Schroedinger's cat? - That's an experiment. - That's an experiment. - What was the experiment? For instance, you know when you have radioactivity? Particle radioactivity? And you put a cat in a box that would triangulate. And if the particle is disintegrated, there's poison and the cat is dead. And if the particle is not disintegrated, there's no poison and the cat is alive. And all that is in the box and as long as nobody looks in the box, into the box, the cat is not dead, it's not alive, it's just nothing. He's not real, he's just potentially dead or potentially alive, and once you look into the box through a little hole, you make it happen. You could be anything you wanted to be and I wanted to be Audrey Hepburn. I always wanted to be Doris Day. - I wanted to be Snow White. - Sleeping Beauty. - Cinderella. - Guinevere. I wanted to be Nick and Nora Charles. I wanted to be on a ranch. I wanted to be in my long skirt with a tiny waist, frying up the bacon and waiting for my cowboy to come home. I couldn't figure out whether or not I wanted to be Kim Novak with that gorgeous blonde hair and that voice and those eyes and that body in that black dress with that red necklace, or whether or not I wanted to be Jimmy Stewart saving Kim Novak. I saw the movie Gidget when I was eight years old and I think she was my first romantic heroine because she was very cool and I wanted to be Gidget and Gidget got Moondoggie at the end and not any of those other bimbos. But when I grew up I wasn't Audrey Hepburn. I mean, I was an okay person, I was me, but I wasn't Audrey Hepburn. People didn't react to me the way they reacted to Audrey Hepburn. It's very hard when you grow up and you really don't look like Kim Novak. As I got into my teens I found it very hard to be Gidget, because the bimbos were ruthless, you know, and the Moondoggies were really dumb. Katharine Hepburn was my favorite role model 'cause she was really strong, dynamic, intelligent and always got this fantastic guy at the end. But men are scared shitless of that kind of woman. What are you thinking? I was thinking what if this is all a movie that I'm making? What if you're all actors in a movie that I'm making, then what? What if the camera's there? There. Does that make this less real? Does that make this that this isn't really happening? What if the camera's right there? That's what I was thinking. You know, I don't go places like I should? I don't go anywhere where there's not a film festival or I'm going to a location to make a film or I'm going to do press for the opening of a film. But I don't go anyplace in this great big beautiful world because I'm scared to see something so beautiful by myself that I will get upset at being unable to share the beauty. So it's very nice to have somebody to share some of this beauty with. Oh, my God, look at this. You know what they discovered in physics recently? What? That we think things are separate, and they're not. I mean, they found out that two particles, when you do something to one of them it affects the other one. I can't hear you. I'm saying that the universe isn't separated. It's all one thing. It's real. And if you touch one particle it affects other particles because all of it before was in the Big Bang. Before the Big Bang they were all close to each other, and when you touch one thing in the universe it affects all the other things. So it means that what we see as different things is just one thing. One whole thing. So maybe our particles were very close before the Big Bang. You know, our little atoms were just next to each other. - Yours and mine? - Yes. - Maybe. - Maybe. And, um... They are rediscovering each other. - Yeah, well, that's maybe. - In Venice. - Something like that. - Something... It's a very nice, romantic view of physics. - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't know why I'm thinking about it now. You're a particle, huh? I'm many particles together. - Can you go inside here? - Okay. - Excuse me, Mister. - Yeah? Do you have a second? Paula Bliss from The Guardian. - From The Guardian? Sure. Yeah. - Just a couple of questions. Can you wait a second and I'll just do this? - Thanks. It won't take long. - Thanks. Sure. I heard you talking earlier at the press conference about your way of working. Has it evolved a lot over the years? Evolve? I hope so, I mean, we all try to evolve, we all try to grow constantly, I'm just trying to get more in touch with what it is that I want to feel in life and the only way I can do it is by aiming a camera at things. - No, no, just relax. - Okay. - Just let it go. - Okay. - Yeah? - Tell me about Dean. What do you want to know? I know you've been together, haven't you? Why do you want to know? Just tell me about him. Why do you want to know? His movies were really something... Something very special to me because sometimes you feel that this movie is absolutely, has been made for you. I mean, you are the person who is supposed to watch this movie, you know what I mean? You take a lot of risks. Have you learned to take more risks over the years? I've learned that risks are the best thing. Everything that happens, good and exciting that happens in film and in life, it comes as a result of a risk. - Mm-hmm. - You can't plan life anyways. It's just an illusion that there's some kind of plan, some kind of order. We know it's totally chaos, so risk is my middle name. So you were still in love while you were making the movie, so that was real. You were really in love with him at the time, right? - We loved each other at the time. - Mm-hmm. You seemed so real on screen. You seemed so really to be loving each other. I was just wondering if it was true. You say that your way of working gives you a lot of freedom... - Yeah. - ...it also carries a cost. - Mm-hmm. - What is the cost to you, to the actors? For me limitations are the best things in the world because they force you to create art. I don't think you lose anything essential but along the way you lose the comfort and security of a lot of external things that people come to depend upon. I don't think those things are valuable. I think those things are dangerous. Please, thank you. Okay, you wanted some more? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay? Okay? The borderline, when you're filming, between reality and the film is very blurred. - Very... - The... The border in life between reality and film is very bored... Very... What is the word? - Blurred. - Blurred. The reality and life between... The reality and life... No. The reality... What did I say? The borderline between life, real life, and... Right. The borderline between real life and film, you said it's blurred in film and I'm saying out of film. In life. - You're telling me this is reality? - Okay. In life the borderline between fiction and reality is blurred. If you know what's real and what's not real, I don't. I can't believe this is real. This is too bizarre. - Is that what your film's about? - That's what life's about. - Okay. - Okay? - All right. Thank you very much. - My pleasure. Bye-bye. Thank you. Okay, where are you? Okay, we've got to go inside. - Okay, come on. - Okay. Why did you stop loving each other? We didn't stop loving each other. So why did you separate? Oh, God. It's difficult. Life, it's not a movie. I wanted to introduce you to these two people - who loved your film. - Oh, great. What do you think of all this, huh? Thank you very much. Hello. What is it? What is it? What is it? Venice, I see. - Merci beaucoup. - Grazie. Grazie. Molto tante. Molto tante? No, she's French. She's French? I thought she was speaking Italian. He'll put you in a movie, you know? You think? It's obvious. I'm not an actress. Doesn't matter. - I don't think so. - Of course. I'd rather have him put me in his life. Thank you. It's nice to meet you, we have to go. - Okay. - All right. Thank you. Ciao. - Ciao. - Bye. What does the paper say? Every morning when I get up to go to work, I keep wondering why it can't be like The Philadelphia Story. I grew up watching movies and thinking that's the way people talked. I didn't know it was dialogue that was written. Everybody looked great and had money and nobody worked. Someone would be funny and brash and cocky and sophisticated and debonair. Having all those great Norell outfits. I still see that when I go to movies. There's still this easiness in the dialogue that people have and I haven't found that in life. Having all these men be in love with you but never really having to act on it. I was married twice and if either one of those marriages had been movies, everybody would have walked out because no one ever said anything. - Hi. - Hi. - Crazy here. - Yeah. Everybody just takes pictures and I can't do anything about it. - Dean! - Oh, John. How are you? I want you to meet John, my friend, John. - Hello. - John Landis. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - What are you doing here? - I'm on the jury. Oh, did you see my film, then? - I can't talk to you, Dean. - Why not? I'm not allowed... You have a film in competition. - I just wanna ask you... - Not now. - Hello. - Oh. - You have... - It's nuts here, isn't it? - You have a film in competition. - Yeah. I'm not supposed to discuss it. You can't say "hello, how are you? It's nice to see you"? - Dean, it's a pleasure. - How is Debra? - Debra's well. - Is she here? Yeah, she's here. - Oh, great. - We're all here. Doesn't this make you nervous? No, it's a part of the game. Seriously, I'm not supposed to talk... If the other jurors see me I'm in trouble. - Oh, well... - I can't talk to you. All this means is I know that I can't get your vote. It's okay. It's safe, because... You might get my vote, how do you know? You'd be accused of tilting yourself over backwards. - You gotta be very careful. - Nah. - Don't vote for a fellow American. - No, no. - I'm very happy to see you. - It's nice to see you. - Are you having a good time? - Yes. I've never been a juror. The food is good, the food is good. - Okay, I'll see you. Bye. Best to Debra. - Okay. Ciao. You have an appointment in the afternoon. - When? - At four o'clock. Is it okay? You okay? Is it all the time like that? Well, this is part of it, yeah. Did you have a coffee or something? Do you want something to drink? No, I'm okay, thank you. What's the matter? You seem weird. - Yeah, well, I don't understand, really. - What is it? You don't understand what? All these interviews, you're always talking about reality. Look at this. In all these interviews you're telling, "I'm looking for real people, I'm off Hollywood, I don't care about this Hollywood bullshit" and now I find you here and John Landis is here and you say, "Oh, my God." You're so friendly and you're giving these interviews and all these photographs and smiling and so nice. I don't know. - What's the matter? - I don't understand. What don't you understand? I don't understand. This is not reality, this is press about films. - Yes, I know. - You came here for a real person. In all these interviews you're saying how much you care about what people really care about and now I find out that you're spending your time among all these people who are... What do you expect from me? You think that I'm not making movies and having to sell them? So that's your life? That's your life? Staying in palaces, in hotels, meeting reporters... No, that's not my life. This is a part of the job that I have so that I can make the films about the reality. I don't understand how you can stay in touch with reality if you spend your life this way. And I couldn't imagine... That's okay, I mean, I just didn't... I couldn't have imagined that. That's all. That's all, I'm surprised. Sorry, I don't know what to say to you about this. Can we go and have something to eat? We have to eat, even though it's not very poetic. We have to eat, it's real. We go to eat? I don't understand why you can't come with me and watch a movie like a normal person. Because I'm not a normal person, I'm sorry. This is Alain Delon, you like him. I love him but I can't see a movie. I've got press, I've got interviews, I've got all kinds of obligations here. I'm sorry, this is not like a holiday for me, I don't know why you don't understand this. You're a journalist, you should understand this, no? - Yeah. - You go and see the movie and enjoy the movie. I want you to enjoy the movie and have a very good time. It's just that I'd love you to come with me to see a movie. I can't just go see movies. I go to film festivals to work, I don't go to see movies. These people come to see my movies. You never see a movie when you go to a festival? I never see a movie when I go to a festival. Will you please come and see this movie with me? - I can't do that. - Please. - I mean, I... - We have to talk with the Japanese. What Japanese? - The Japanese who sent me a fax from Tokyo. - Okay. Dean. You've been doing interviews all day. Do I exist a little bit? - Of course you exist. - Can you come with me and... Look... I said in a moment, okay? You go and see the movie, let me do my business. These people came all the way from... - Okay, okay, this is ridiculous. - ...to take care of me. Don't worry, I'll pick you up later. What fax? What Japanese? The Japanese that made an offer for your film. What is the deal? What do the Japanese want? They want to buy the film for Japan. They want all rights, they want theatrical... And how much are they gonna pay? I think they are shy. They want us to tell them how much we want. Movies give you this image of men, the role models for men. I kept looking for Burt Lancaster. You see this guy, you think, I want this guy to save me. I want this guy to take me away. I want him to look at me and know this is the only girl for me. He was male perfection. He was physically beautiful and he had this tenderness about him. But they're not like that. They're too busy telling you about their last relationship or what BMW they've just bought. He could love a woman in a way that I wanted to be loved. Men were Cary Grant, men were Gregory Peck. But in reality men were not Gregory Peck, men were assholes. I'm sorry, I'm very sorry. I don't know what happened. I had a conference and it went a little later. I'm sorry, all these people are looking here. They're waiting for whoever's coming in next. Let's get out of here. Let's get out of the way. I've been waiting here for you all this time. What are you so upset about? We're talking. I don't like this thing. What is the matter with you? I'm sorry, let's just go away. There are people looking at me, they know who I am. - You can't do this in front of people. - You always care about yourself. - No. - I don't care about these people looking at me. Okay, but we don't want to make a scene in front of people looking at me. Let's go out through here. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute. Where are you going? Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Why are you running away? I don't want to stay here anymore. - What are you talking about? - Leave me alone! - Why? - Don't pull me like that. Okay, but why... Stay in your world, it's very nice. I don't belong here, I don't know what I'm doing. Oh, come on, let's have a coffee and talk about it. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I just... I feel like I don't know what I'm doing here. Bye. When I was growing up, I thought that movies were real life and that my life wasn't. I thought that if I could just grow up, if I could just survive my childhood I could get out into the real world and it would be the way it was in the movies. My favorite movie when I was growing up as a little girl was always It's a Wonderful Life, because no matter how bad it was, no matter what the struggles were, you could always count on the love of the parents and the love of the children and the love of the family and the love of the home. There were daddies in families and my father left when I was about seven. Um, the houses were all clean and my house was a mess 'cause my mother took in dress making to take care of us. Turned out it wasn't like the movies and I felt betrayed. I can't control it like they do in the movies. I have no way of making it all work so perfectly like it did for Gary Cooper and all the beautiful people. I mean, it makes me feel bad about getting older, it makes me feel like there's something wrong with me that my life didn't work out that way. I felt that all those people who made all those movies and wrote all those love songs knew it was a sham and that they were just playing this big cruel joke on all of us to make money off our emotions. In the movies there's a happy ending and in life there are just endings. * How do I love thee * Let me count the ways Hi. Hi, um, hi. Is that Dean's house? - I'm Jeanne Marie. - Peggy. Can I get your... I'll bring you bags in, that's what I'll do. Thank you. You can go, get something to drink. * Shall I, my love, Compare thee to * * Baba au rhum Or summer's day? * * Handel chorale or Malibu? Thank you. * Rubens, Ravel, Or Mel Torme? * * Is there a better metaphor * For how I melt beholding you? * * Or shall the glow I so adore * * Only be felt enfolding you? * * Racking my brain for fitting praise * * Seeking in vain the perfect phrase * * Poring through piles of poems and plays * * Haunting the aisles at Doubleday's * * I might convey the state I'm in * * If I could play the mandolin * * Since I cannot I'll just declare * * You are beyond compare and leave it right there * * Who could compose your Valentine? * * Not Billy Rose nor Gertrude Stein * * Only a heart like Larry might tell you * * What burns in mine tonight * * That rich of which there's only one * * Simply defies comparison * * So I repeat in sweet despair * * You are beyond compare * And leave it right there Great. Great. I cannot tell you how great that is. I'm not sure that that works for the movie. - Want another? - It's really beautiful, but I don't think I can use it. It's just not, um... It's gentle, I've got this kind of... I love it, it's just, um... I've reached the age now, it's called the aging songwriter's syndrome. Any subject that comes up I've written a song about that. But now it's gotten to the point where there are at least two. Let's take a little break now and everybody enjoy themselves. Everybody, have a drink or something. Don't worry about it. Sunday afternoon, you know, relax, be casual, family. I'm not addicted to these Sundays. - Oh, honey, please. - When do I get to meet this Dean? I mean, I didn't come here to see some guy sing. He's not gonna have a bullet on the rap charts. You were great in that. Thank you very much. Was there a script, or did you have any kind of storyboard or lines? - There was no script. - There was no script for that? So you're in financing? I am, yeah, we do some international financing, lately we've gotten into some films. - Right. - And it's been interesting. Why do you keep looking at him like that? I got business with him. I want to talk to him as soon as he's through with that girl. - Is that all right? - Yeah. Okay, that's what I'm doing. What are you doing here? Why are you here? How do you happen to be here? I'm just coming from the airport. I'm sorry, did I miss something? I didn't... You didn't tell me you were coming. Well, I wanted to surprise you. So you wanted to surprise me? Yes. I'm in his next movie. I'm going to be starring. I've never worked this way. I've never had no script. No nothing. You deal mostly in Deutschmarks or are you dealing in dollars? Oh, yeah, of course Deutschmarks. He's got all these qualities. Well, then that's what he'll bring forth. - Won't you? - My qualities? - Yeah. - I'm not comfortable with my qualities. We have to pay in dollars of course. That's the interesting part for us. - Well, it's a big risk for us sometimes. - Sure. You know, I wanna get with an actor like yourself and just work on this kind of style. - That's what you'll do. - But beforehand... No, no, no, you don't do it beforehand. But I'd like to, is what I'm saying. I mean... Well, you don't do it beforehand. You do it. I'm not comfortable just doing it. Business, business, business. Well, you're making it very obvious that you're looking at him. They'll be through in a minute and then I can talk to the man. I just was so stunned when I saw you. I didn't know... Didn't you think you should write and tell me you were gonna come? No. If you want me to go I can go. No, I'm very happy to see you. Really. Yeah? A little confused and a little scared - but very happy to see you. - Mm-hmm. I keep getting it confused, this idea I have about love that I've seen in movies and my real life. The one most important thing that I remember from films as a child and that I see now as an adult is passion. The woman on the train platform who by some mysterious magnetic force is drawn across the train platform through 50,000 people to the man of my dreams, you know? The feeling of watching these two people go towards one another, just drawn towards one another, it seems as if they're just running to be towards one another. Our hearts would start pounding, the music would build and we'd run off to the sunset together and we'd live happily ever after. I remember the feeling of sitting with a man that I was seeing and looking at these two people on the screen running towards one another and jumping into each other's arms. And this feeling just hit me in the pit of my stomach and I thought, my God, I don't have that with this man. You know, I'm in a lousy mood, I walk in the door from being stuck, I don't know, in a traffic jam for two hours and, you know, I see my boyfriend and my heart doesn't pound right out of my shirt and he doesn't talk like Cary Grant does. If I'm 80 years old and I'm with someone and I still love looking at them across the table, um, that to me will be true passion. Why did you and Dean break up? Well, you know, it was a long time ago. - Yeah? - You really want to know? Yeah. It's very difficult to, you know, explain these things, like, boom, in one. It's many, many things. Explain it in stages. What is that stuff? Rescue remedy. It just sort of... Rescue remedy? You're from where? Paris. Oh, Paris, France. Paris, France, that's it. You live here? That's your place? It's where I'm staying. - Staying. - Mm-hmm. - What does it do? - It just calms you down. I think it'd be good for you. Maybe. Are you actually living here or not living here? I'm actually living here, yeah. You live here with Dean? Yeah, I live here with Dean. And you're in love with him? Why? Are you in love with him? I'm asking about you right now. Is it so difficult to answer? - No. - What's the big mystery here? I have a feeling it's a big mystery if you're living here or not, - just asking you a question. - Wait, wait, wait. It's fine, I'll answer the question. I mean, you don't have to if you don't want to. - I just said I'd answer the question. - Okay. Yes, I love Dean. He's been very, very, very good to me. Does he love you? I mean... I suppose he does. Do you have any plans together, or... I don't make a lot of plans. When you fall in love with someone it's like the sun comes out and it shines on part of you. - You understand that? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. So, so the process of falling in love is highlight of self, which makes you feel 100 times more alive. Every time I fall in love it's either all or nothing. It takes me so long to fall in love with somebody and then I find somebody that I really fall in love with and I fall so much in love that I become possessed by this person. Or at least my idea of this person. And then I spend all my time trying to be what I think this person wants me to be. My wardrobe changes, my-my style changes, the things I say change, the way I think changes, my political beliefs change. And, the thing is that if they fall in love with that person, then I know that they're not falling in love with me so I have to play this charade for the rest of my life... ...which is crazy because you almost hate them for not loving you for who you are. But if they love me for who I am I think maybe they're not so great. You know that old Groucho Marx thing. There's somethin'... There's something between the two of you. I don't want you to feel that I'm intru... Of course I am intruding. You know, I'm just coming here, - I really don't want to mess, mess up your whole life. - No. What was it between you and Dean? I needed him. I needed somebody who would help me get dressed in the morning. I needed somebody who would ask if I had had any lunch. I needed a lot, I was a mess. I was a mess. He helped me to grow up and he helped me to accept responsibilities. And he helped me to... have a life. A real life, not just... sort of marching through. A life that I'll always have. I'll always be me... because of him... no matter what. No matter what. When I imagined the Pacific, I imagined sunsets. Cause I had this poster above my bed all my childhood that was called "Pacific Sunset." Is this what it looked like to you? In your mind? Huh? I don't know, it's not sunset yet. In Brittany, where I come from, the west coast of France, they have their own language, it's Breton. I know. And they only have one word to say "blue" and "green." It don't make any difference, it's the same color for them, because it's the color of the sea. It was very much like that, palm trees and all orange, and I thought, one day, I promised myself one day I will see a Pacific sunset. It was like a huge thing because I'd never traveled, my parents never left France. And here it is. Yeah. You just don't know what's going on in this universe. You just don't know. You just have a feeling, a sensation, but you cannot know anything about what is really there. But what is real besides your perceptions? Explain it to me, I don't understand. How do you know if something really exists? And how do you know whether what other people perceive is the same thing that you perceive or it's just imagination, every one of us just dreaming a world completely different than the world you are inventing? Where were you all day? Walking. Out on the beach. I just go out and take either right or left, north or south. It helps me think. I just love these Sundays with all these people coming in, dropping by all the time. Isn't it fun? Dean is always wandering around. Dean thinks it's fun. You don't like it? I don't know. Is that because you don't like that girl that's here? French girl? I guess she's some kind of femme fatale. Sort of. I... I like her. How can you like her? She's so different from you. You're so simple, you know, jeans and California, and she's this French, uh, coquette. I don't see her being coquettish or anything. She's so French. Do you only like people who are somewhat similar to you? What the hell does he want anyway? Total subjugation. I think you're gonna get the part. Dylan? Dylan, okay, I'm going upstairs now. Um, five minutes, all right? Hmm? For what? What was that about? I don't know. Ugh. I mean, I don't know if Dean is... If they sleep together. I mean... Do you think he's like playing a game with me, you think this is some kind of test? - How are you? - Nice to see you. What business are you guys in? Are you together in business? - No. - No, no. We just sat next to each other. - Did you know Chico before you came here, Hanno? - No. - And Chico, Hanno? - No, this is a chance meeting. - You met here, today? - Seems to be. Why are you both here? What business are you in? - Finance. - Finance. In the finance business. You know, sometimes directors like to play with you to get you in a dependent situation and maybe have some kind of secret on you. Hanno, this is amazing, that you and Chico should sit next to Dennis. - You know who Dennis is, don't you? - No. I'm Dean's producer. - Oh, you're Dean's producer. - Of course, I am. - You understand what I'm saying? - No, I don't. They play... - Are you interested in her? - Yeah. Oh. But I don't know if I should, you know, because he's around and I don't know where he's being or who's... Go for it. You know what Dean said to me? He said, "You're gonna see tonight Hanno and Chico." - And here we sit. - And here we sit. Isn't this amazing? I'm sitting here and all of a sudden it's Hanno and Chico. - Chico, right? - Chico. - Hanno? Right. - Hanno. Well, it's more than five minutes. I'm not going. - She's waiting. - No, you see, he wants me to go up there. He does. He's been waiting all night. He knows I've been waiting all night so he wants me to go up there, then he's gonna look for me, he's gonna say, "Where were you?" He completely controls your life. No, he's trying to control my life and I'm not letting him. I'm just going to wait here. He's got to come here at some point. Do you know what F. Scott Fitzgerald said was the difference between a sentimental person and a romantic person? Unh. He said a sentimental person is a person who thinks that things will last. A romantic person is one who has the desperate confidence that things won't last. Will things last? Yes. Well, good, then you're not leaving. I don't think that's what's going to last. So what's gonna last? What we gave each other. It took you long enough. I was waiting for you. I... I... No, no, no. Once you came up it was fine, but it took you long enough to get here. I always got the idea that even though you never saw them making love in the movies, you never really saw anything transpire, and even though one of them was probably, had never had sex before, that when they finally did it, it was absolutely fantastic. Oh, I love, love, love this. What were you hovering about downstairs, huh? I was waiting for... just to talk to Dean. You would never imagine Spencer Tracey and Katharine Hepburn, uh, having a quickie. - I don't like feeling like Dean is... - Like what? I feel like a marionette, feel like he's manipulating me. H-he's not here. Will you just relax. What's your problem? Let him worry about what he worries about and you do what you have to do. Is this... I mean, I don't know if this is part of what I have to do. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Of course it isn't. - You're very paranoid. - I just wanted to... I wanted to work with you. - With me? - Yeah. Because you've worked with Dean before. You need to feel secure or something? You know, security isn't the answer to everything, you know. It just isn't. What is? There's a great line in a play by John Webster, which is, "Security some men call the suburbs of hell." Think about it. I feel like I'm being watched, like, you know, here, here, anywhere. Or a tape recorder or something. Just... Just be, just be. I like cowboys a lot. I always have. I grew up in the '70s and that was like post-sexual revolution. A cowboy to me always represented everything that I wanted in a fella. They were strong and masculine and they were good to their dames. Women were having orgasms on the screen for the first time and sex was this big deal. These days there aren't that many cowboys around and they happen to come in the forms of musicians. I just couldn't wait till I'd know what that was. The only problem with cowboys is they had a tendency to leave and not necessarily for anybody else, just to go. In the movies the guy is always really sexy and virile and strong and aggressive, and he just takes the woman and he grabs her and he throws her up against the wall and he kisses her hard, and I always thought I wanted that but now I realize that if a guy really did that to me I'd slap him. Ever since Jeanne Marie got here, I feel, all of a sudden, like there's some part of the world that I am never going to be capable of understanding. I think that I've always had it in the back of my head but something has made it very clear there's some kind of way of thinking that I'm never gonna be capable of. I guess what it is is that she and Dean have something that they can share that I will never... even begin to know. Maybe it's time for me to... see how grown up I really got. When you do something courageous in your life, there's lots of movement afterwards. And you're being very courageous right now. And you'll be rewarded for it. I promise you. I know. I know. We've pre-sold the film for Germany, big, big, big sale. - Right. - Yeah. Even before shooting a single scene. - Isn't that nice? - It's fantastic. - So what do you want? - Carlotta told me that you wanted to see me. Oh, yeah. Well, I wanted to talk to you about the part, about what you're gonna do in the movie but when I went looking to talk to you you were gone, I found out that I couldn't find you. I didn't know where you were. And then I find that Carlotta told me that you were fucking her. Which is cool, but I just don't think, you know, since you chose to do that I think that's a way of your saying to me you'd rather not talk about the part. I wasn't saying anything to you. You knew it would come back to me since it's Carlotta, so I figure that what you're trying to do is say to me, "Dean, I'd rather not talk about "the details about this part, I like your way of working, "I like the spontaneity and I'll just show up on the first day of the set and be available to you, be open." And I think you're right. I think your instincts are really right. I think it's better, I think it's better for the part, I think it's better for our communication, I think it's better that you don't have too much information to go on. I think it-it'll stiffen you and it'll, you know, it'll tighten you up. I've looked at the films over and over again, four different films, small scenes you've had. You were good in them, but there was a tightness that I want to break. I want to get a looseness and I'm afraid that if I give you too much information... I think that's what was wrong. You obviously had a script, you had time to study, and those films were conventional films, and you were really good in them or I wouldn't want you to star in this movie. It's very important for me. You're playing a starring role. But since you choose to fuck rather than be available to talk, that's good, too. It tells me something about you and I'm working that into the character. I don't understand. What? It's good for the character. Because you know, I use... I pull stuff out of actors, I don't try to impose parts in a conventional way like I used to on an actor, you know? I don't try to impose my idea on an actor. I want to pull the part, the sensibility out of the actor, right? So if you're the kind of guy who goes off and fucks somebody when you've got a business meeting, which is totally fine. It's good. I'm not saying this as a put-down... I waited the entire night to talk to you. Until you chose to fuck Carlotta. Right? Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff. David Niven. Which do I choose? Good boy-bad boy? Bad boy-good boy? Inevitably the movies make the bad boy far more appealing than the good boy. But in real life the bad boys, they are never there. I mean, they're afraid of love. They're running around and they're afraid, and... And they're bad. My favorite movies were these mythological adventures and so I always dreamed of this ideal romantic dark handsome adventurer that I'd end up with. Inside of me I want this rough guy, I want this cad. If they're inarticulate and cannot string two sentences together, very angry... That means they really love you. The movies that I really went for when I was a kid were musicals and pirate films. So I always ended up looking for the swashbucklers who sang. I was most attracted to the movies where someone died. Or where someone left or there was some insurmountable reason they couldn't be together. I think the movies made me need to have a really handsome guy. The problem was that I found that the swashbucklers usually ended up being abusers. They would go to war or there'd be some great distance between them. Or they'd even marry someone that they didn't love because they couldn't be with the person that they did love because they were dead. If he was lacking in substance, well, that was okay, because he looked like he was supposed to look, and then I went out of my way to look like I was supposed to look and it was all gonna turn out great 'cause we looked right. So if someone really loves you, they leave you. Permanently if possible. - Thank you. - No, you're supposed to take the little one, it's for you. Where is Jeanne Marie? She, um, she went out for a walk, I think. She's just, uh... She's a little messed up about the time. You know, it's exhausting when you come from Paris. Just the time? Well, it's been a long trip for her. Anyway, back to this stuff here. You've seen practically all of them. I've not seen Kathleen, I've not seen Annie. I have seen her. I've not seen... - This one you didn't want to see. - No, no, no. - Okay, scratch. - What's the new movie? The new movie is called Happy Ending. And it is a movie in which I cast a woman or look to cast a woman play my wife. - And it's about? - Finding a happy ending. He can't find the right actress for the wife. And finding the right actress for the wife, yeah, you're right. Yeah, so he thinks that he's gonna find a woman when he makes the movie but I think he should just make the movie with who he has around him and maybe he'll be surprised. - It's been a long day, hasn't it? - Indeed. - When are you shooting, every day? - No. Not every day. - Oh, good! So watch some of this stuff. - Okay. We're doing an interesting process. We're kind of shooting them being interviewed for the job. He asks people their personal status, personal status questions. Marital status? I love all these phrases. It's time to go to sleep. Are you tired at all? A little bit. - Why don't you go home? - When are we gonna do this? We can do it tomorrow in the morning. I don't wanna work now, I'm just too tired to work now. Tomorrow you're going to be doing something else. - Where are you staying? Where did they put you? - Bel-Air. - Bel-Air, very nice. - You don't even wake up in the morning. - You're gonna have your machine on... - No, no, no. Enough work, okay? Go home. - Good night. - Good night, love. Have a great shoot. And I'll see you when? - Tomorrow. - Okay. - At the office. - Right. Check exactly about the time, okay? - Check with this little one here. Okay. - Can I ask you something? - Get out of here, will you, please? - Can I ask you one thing? - What? - Can I audition for the wife? - What, are you, crazy? - Why? - I mean, I'm an act... - You're not an actress. - Yeah, but I can be one. - Okay. We'll talk about it some other time. I wish you'd just stick with doing your job the way you're supposed to do your job and everything's gonna be fine. You're really good at this. - You're being a great help to me. - Just let me read something. Okay, speak to you later. Good night. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye-bye. It's her lip liner. - Did you steal it from her so she won't use it? - Of course. I try to keep her sort of stripped bare of some of the excesses. - Hi. - Hi. Big day. An important one. Yeah. So what are you going to do about her? I see something she does to you. Yeah, she's very special. No question about it, she's real special. It scares me. I think that maybe you need to be a little bit scared. I think you should go in the deep end. Why? I took and took and took from you. You didn't take anything from me. It was mutual taking and mutual giving. You have to understand, there's always two people. If one person wants to let you take then they are taking by letting you take. That's part of it. Yeah, but here's somebody who can give to you. Maybe, but in any case, I don't want you to feel in any way and for any moment that you took more than you gave, 'cause it's just not true. What I'm scared of with her is that there's something she wants that I don't have to give. I know what I can give you. I don't know what it is that I need to give her. - I think you should find out. - But what if I can't do it? And then what? You'll fail at something in your life? - That's pretty scary for me. - It's okay. I told you many times you're too small a kid to be so wise. I don't want a wise-guy kid here. Don't start growing up too fast on me. I just hope she fixes your socks for you. A touch of meow, at least there's a little. Meow, here. Let's go to bed. - Okay? - Yeah. Go on and I'll be there in a bit. Okay. I've been waiting for you. I didn't expect anybody to be up this late. Can't believe you stayed outside so long. It's cold by the ocean. Hmm. Well, you know, I don't know what the time is anymore. I'm still in Paris time, I don't know. What I should do now is call a taxi and go to the airport, find an hotel, spend the night, spend some time and get on a plane to Paris. - No. - Yeah. No, no, you can't do that. Yes, that's what I should do. That's what I'm going to do now. You came here, you came here for a reason and you have to see it through. I think I've seen enough really. He doesn't care about me that much and you're here, and... No. No, don't even think about me. No, no, no. You don't understand. No. I just dreamed the whole thing, I guess. You stay here tonight, I'll be gone in the morning. I feel so exhausted. I know. So I'll stay, I guess. Can I sleep here? I'll get you some sheets. You're so nice. I don't want you to be gone in the morning. You rest. - You all right? - Yeah. Just close your eyes. Hi. Stay asleep, stay asleep. Hmm. Here's everything you need. Don't you think you oughta take your boots off? Yeah, I probably should. And I'll see you in the morning, okay? - Mm-hmm. - Okay? I always felt like I was waiting. Waiting for something to happen, for him to come and then my life would start. In Disney movies life begins at marriage. You met someone, you fell in love, then you got married and you lived happily forever after. And I got married and that was wonderful. For two years. I always had this feeling like somebody would see me and they'd see how sweet I was and the birds around me and they knew how the animals loved me and they'd know what a great person I was and they would fall in love with me immediately. Men that I thought were going to fall in love with me like I had seen in the movies come into my life and then leave. I'd get married and I'd go off into the sunset and have babies and it'd be great. Never happened. I've been single for 11 and a half years. And that's not the way I saw it in the movies. The movies did not prepare me for that. No one prepared me for that. I was supposed to be married and happy forever. Bing Crosby musicals, Fred Astaire, I always dreamt of being with this wonderful guy and we'd tap dance around the fountains and we'd be tapping in the rain and everybody on the street would be going... * She's in love She's in love * * With a wonderful guy Now we're gonna see the first and most important site that there is to see in Venice. - Mm-hmm. - This way, this way. - Mm-hmm. - This way. - Mm-hmm. - Straight ahead. - So... - Now, what do you think it is, the single most important Venetian site? - The ocean. - The ocean, huh? - No. - No? But it's very close to the ocean. The canals? No, very close to the canals. This is my office. - This here? Oh. - Yeah. Yes, I don't have to go very far, do I? No. Oh, my God. - Hi. - Hi, everybody. I'm sorry I'm late. Got a little hung up. Sorry to keep you all waiting. I think what we're gonna do for the sake of efficiency and the way I've structured it, is that, uh, we're going to do the auditions right here right here, instead of going into the other room or setting it up. That's why you see the camera here. Somebody turn the phone off because we've got the camera live. You can answer it but then turn it off, okay? Oh, excuse me one second. Why don't you wait in my office? Yeah, okay. I'm sorry, I forgot that we had this scheduled. You didn't remind me... - Over there? - Yeah, in my private office. I'll just be like half an hour, 45 minutes, okay? - You'll be okay? - Yeah. Okay. Great. Hi. Let's start with this extraordinary-looking creature in the jacket. - Are you set up okay, Hanania? - All the way in. Okay, I'd like you to look right into the camera, straight into the camera. - What is your name? - Stephanie. Why are you looking at me? Could you do it right into the camera? You mean I have to talk the whole time into the camera? Why, do you object to doing that? Well, if this is an interview, I'd like to talk to a human being. Yeah, but it's an interview for the part of my wife which can't possibly be a human being. So, it's, uh... I gotta ask you stuff about... No, I'd like you to look into the camera. - I can't. - Why not? - I can't work that way. - Why not? Because that's not a human eye. If you want to know who the human being is here, I have to be able to communicate with a human eye, with hopefully a soul behind it. God, I can't guarantee you that. What I want to know is about you as a potential wife and mother. - So... - Sorry. Are you... I'm sorry... You find that amusing to you? I didn't know what the role was. I know. I don't tell people what the roles are. Yeah. You know we've been waiting about several hours today and how many hours yesterday? I'm sorry about yesterday. I know that you were there yesterday and I'm very, very sorry. Can you see me as the father of your children? - No. - Why not? We haven't attempted anything physical together. How do you know what that would be like? - Well, I... - What kind of a face is that? I mean, that's... It's as if the idea was the most - ridiculous thing in the world. - It's pretty ridiculous. Come up to me to show how hurt I am, please. - Actually... - Look at this face. Why? Why? That's a little too much, right? Why? I really am hurt but I'm trying to cover it up by pretending to be hurt. Why is it such a ridiculous idea? I thought you were pretty intriguing when I met you that night. - That's nice to know. - Yeah. But I thought about it. I can't believe I'm saying this in front of all these women! So then what you would want to have with me is an affair rather than a marriage. - I don't even think that. - No? I'm sorry but I think that there would just be too much, uh, animosity. We were so argumentative and I thought there were great sparks from that, but that's not who you marry. Let's go over here. Let's go to her left, okay? Okay. Hi, there. - Hi. - Look into the camera. Have you had any experience as a wife or mother? How are you? What is he doing? Goodness. This is hard, to look into the camera. - I know. - Okay. It's sort of like there's, it's, there's no one there. Why could you play the part of my wife? I think I'm right for the part. - Really? Why? - Yeah. I just do. - You really want to be my wife? - Yeah, I do. - In life? - Yeah. - You mean on film and in life. - Yeah. - All of the above. - Which one more? I think it would be, um, which one, hmm? Well, um, but this is for a part, right? - I mean, initially this is for a part? - Right. So I think we should start there. Okay, thank you very much. I think it's quite a refreshing way. - How did he audition you? - That's beside the point. Off camera? You're very cheeky. - I'm not cheeky. - Yes, you are. - You're very cheeky. - I'm learning from him. I will never be a wife in real life and I just hate what it represents. I will never cook and clean and pick up after anybody. Why does a wife have to be cooking, cleaning and picking up? Isn't that an old-fashioned idea of a wife? Yeah, that's my mother's version of a wife. It's how I grew up, it's traditional and no matter what it ends up that way. What about children? I'm afraid to have children. You probably think that makes me a terrible woman, and I feel guilty as hell about it but... I don't know, maybe I'd be a terrible mother. I'm too selfish. I don't think that makes you anything. It just makes you whatever you are. There's no rules here. Nobody says you have to be certain things. Just what do you want to be? I am an actress. I want to be a strong woman. I want to show the world that it's not bad to be a woman. - Thank you. - What's he like in bed? Why do you want to know? Well, if I'm gonna marry the guy, I'm going to have to know what he's like in bed. Listen, you've just got to stop all this and relax and enjoy the job you have. I mean, this is absurd, this behavior. What's he like in bed? I wanna know. Expectations of what marriage should be, how you're supposed to act. My dress started becoming more conservative, I started cooking meals on a regular basis. Not me at all. Um... And I started becoming like a housewife. And I never really... You know, like Donna Reed or somebody like that, and I never really wanted to be Donna Reed. It took me about two years to recover myself because I sort of lost myself in, uh, the ideal of what I thought marriage was going to be. Would you like to get married again? Um... I'd like a relationship, uh, but no marriage. I want everything that's included in marriage without marriage, without the contract of marriage. Could you play my wife? Now, the part of me that's Doris Day wants to say, that... say yes, because I feel like I should defer to, you know, be nice to you but the part of me that's now, like, claiming myself says no because I think you're too abrasive and that would scare me on a regular basis. Hold on a second. - Is everything all right? - Yeah, everything's fine. How much film is he in? Well, I feel like I should get married in three weeks. Why? Because I'm 36 and I've waited too long. Tell me about being a wife and a mother. I feel like I'd like to go to the Volvo Station Wagon Store and buy the car with the kids already in it. - Okay, you insist on doing this, right? - It's about time. What are you gonna show me? What are you gonna do? What did they show you? Look at me. Into the camera. I'd like to give you a chance now. Tell me why you should play this part. You insisted on putting yourself in front of the camera. Tell me something. - I'm your wife. I'm your real wife. - What do you mean? I mean, I take your crap, I take care of you, you rely on me, I love you in spite of everything. That's not a very healthy idea of a wife. That's a very subjugated idea of a wife. I don't want a wife who's a slave, I don't want a servile wife. I want an equal, strong wife. Do you think I'm servile? I don't know. You're telling me that you take my crap and for that reason you're a good wife? No, it means that I like you for what you are. A bad person who gives you crap? Well, that's part of you. I want you to be stronger, I want you to be more powerful, I want you to not take any crap from me. Well, then, stop giving me crap. No! Don't take it from anybody. What should I do, slap you? You should do whatever you have to do. Tell me what you really feel. Okay. You never asked me if I could be a good mother. Well, I think that that might be my best talent probably, because I think I could be a good mother to you. And I think that's what you really need and that's what you've been searching for your whole fucking life. A mother? Okay, good for you. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm so bored, I don't want to wait anymore. - What are you talking about? - It's my turn, ask me stuff. - But you're not an actress. - I don't care. Ask me stuff. Well, it's a little strange to ask you this. I feel a little uncomfortable with you. Can't you just ask me some questions the way you were asking other people? You're not interested in me at all? Come on, come on, come on. - Okay. - Ask me stuff. The problem is I'm trying to cast somebody - to play the part of my wife. - Uh-huh. I didn't know if you understood that. So I don't think you wanna play the part of my wife. I mean, what does that mean? I'm trying to find an actress to play my wife, I'm having a lot of difficulty. - Really? - Yes. It must be very difficult. - What do you mean by that? - To be your wife. I don't know about playing your wife, but being your wife must be very difficult. - Okay. - What would you like your wife to be? I don't know, I'm trying to find out what I want my wife to be. That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm trying to find what I want my wife to be. - So? - So, uh... Would you like to be my wife? - Yeah, sure, absolutely. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I'm trying to get an answer to a part within a movie, you see. I answer as an actress wanting to get the part in your movie. Yes, of course. I would love to be your wife on screen. Mm-hmm. Okay. Do you like being in front of this camera? I like you're looking at me a little bit. You're always looking at so many people. Yeah, well, it's difficult. There's a lot of people to look at. When somebody's sitting in front of the camera it's much easier to look at them. - What's wrong? - That's your problem. Tell me what you don't like about it. What really you don't like about it. How can someone share your life? Do you know about your life? Do you know the time you spend with other people around? Never alone, never in your home? I don't have a home. Home is a... no, home is a place where you have a family, where you have a partner, that's a home. Yeah, but you don't leave any room for that in your life. - There's no space for it. - So how can I create space for it? That's what I'm wondering. You don't leave any space for that, you're always playing. That's why I'm trying to make this movie. To find out the answer to how I can make space for that. And you really think that having people sitting here and answering your questions, that's how you're going to find a wife? In the movie. I'm talking about real life. I don't know what real life is. Oh, my God. Maybe you're right, maybe this is a mistake. Maybe what I have to do is not try to find somebody to play my wife. I guess I should just have someone play a woman I meet somewhere who may or may not become my wife. Maybe... Maybe she'd be a... I don't know, a journalist, a journalist who comes to interview me, say, at a film festival. You know, I'm going to the Venice, Italy Film Festival next month. Maybe we should shoot the movie there. Would you like to play the part of a journalist? You are a journalist, aren't you? This was my mistake. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I came here. I didn't have to come here. Okay. Just let's talk quietly. No. It's raining anyway and I have to go. I'm sorry, I don't know what I'm doing here. - Let's have a cup of coffee... - No! Wait a minute. Where are you running? What do you think? I just hate looking at myself anyways. Oh, that's very helpful. I don't know. I hate the way I look so much. - Don't be stupid. - I hate it. I cannot understand why we couldn't have a makeup person there. There's no reality if you have a makeup person in the middle of a movie. Why is it more real if I have three pimples in the middle of my forehead? You think anybody can see your pimples in this? I can't see nothing but it. Wait, wait, wait, listen to this. This one. Why are you running away from me? I don't want to stay here anymore. - Don't be silly. Why? - I don't want to stay here. It's your world. I don't belong here. Don't touch me? I don't care. I told you to stay. My character told your character. No, no, no, you told me before the take that I should... No. My character told your character to stay. You're supposed to resist me and run out. - Before the take you told me to stay. - Watch. Heisenberg is a very complicated principle. Who's Heisenberg? Heisenberg said that one particle can be in two places at one time. So you and I can be in two places at one time? Yeah. Venice and Venice? Probably. - Past and future? - Mm-hmm. - Movies and real life? - Why not? It's all possible.
