Why are you moving my things? Peggy, who are they? They're helping me to move! Are we moving today? Vi, you! I am moving alone, you'll stay! Why are you moving? Let's separate for a period of time! I've been sleeping with you for 3 years! Last night... our last supper? The last session! Why didn't you say so last night? What do you mean? Now I'm asking you to move, not to talk! I'm helping you to move. I'm not moving myself! Removal means leaving your things behind! Moving things means leaving your house behind! We're adults, not children! Can't we talk it over coolly? Enough, I feel like crying! I may cry if you don't! These paintings are mine! Alex, it's nice for us to separate for some time. We've been together too long. I'm fed up! We may cook off and start again! Let's get married! I don't want to get married! What do you want then? To separate for a period of time! Love doesn't mean cohabitation! You think so? Peggy! Please don't beg me anymore! I've been using this for 3 years, don't take it! This stool fits my bathroom, you buy a new one! It suits me perfectly in size! Don't take it away! Why are you so mean? Take away love, but not this! Do you want love or this stool? What's your choice? You're selfish! Peggy from the studio, please! Peggy su! That one with big, protruding eyes! Alex what about the advertising song? It's ready. See if it's okay! Someone bet dinner with me on the one... Disappointed in love, guess who? I can't! He's an ungroomed man! It's sad to be frustrated in love, and more so to become the butt of a satire! Me, I'd have dug a hole to hide myself! Where can the hole be dug here? She forsake you? Why don't you dig it for me? Where has she moved to? Let me call and curse her. I'm only joking! Disappointment in love is not that serious! It symbolizes the start of a new romance! Don't ever stay alone! Keep busy and forget your sorrow! For instance? Attend the choir for me! Be a volunteer and expect no remuneration! To give free musical lessons to the choir? Stop dreaming! Shut up! I'm now the conductor here! Look at me! Am I very ugly? Make trouble again and I'll throw you out! I paid the fee! So what? Get back! This is a choir, not a circus! Get out of here if you want to be a clown! Get out, idiot! Mr lu, a call from a miss su! Don't move, you imps! Peggy! You've got the stool. Why get mad? Shall we see each other tonight? Silence! Peggy! Quiet! Halt! Repeat that song again! Stop...! You start, not this side! This side, ready, sing! 0o.k.! You and you! You! You three sing together! Don't you know you're singing badly? Come out! You stand over there! Ready! Ready? Not yet! Are you kidding me? Is this okay? Not yet! This way? No! It's out of order. You can't fix it! At worst, a penalty, why pull a long face? Mammy, pull back the antenna quickly! Oh, god! Vivian! Vivian! - Vivian! - What is it? Vivian, open the door for mammy quickly! I t's locked inside! Open it, Vivian! I can't open it! Madam! What are you doing? - Don't get any ideas on my daughter! - Don't mess up! What are you doing? Godmother, I didn't do anything to her daughter! Miss mao, sorry! - Niu, we live downstairs - You live downstairs! - You're mistake! - Lets go! Mammy, why are you so excited? Be in full alert like me! Don't open the door for ugly people! Okay! Few with ugly looks are nice! What about good-looking people? Even less! Don't ever open the door for strangers! Now we have no men here. Understand? Don't eat mammy's cucumber! I won't! Presentable! Sure! I mean myself! Do I look ugly? No, even dr chiang downstairs said: You're so young to have me as daughter! - Did you tell him how old I am? - No! Don't confide my secret to others! Ok, but don't insist on my attending the choir! What? I don't want to sing. Don't force me to! $750 for 3 months only? Don't be so spendthrift? That "lu" teacher is disagreeable! A female teacher? Not the previous one? Of course not! He always said I sing badly! A good singer, wouldn't have come to him! And he often pointed at me saying: Shut up and stand over there! He really is disgusting! Well, I'll give up singing! Now we only have this house from your late daddy I earned our living expenses with my own hands! That enrolment form is marked "not refundable" hear it yourself, only your mouth's moving. Mammy, I won't go any more! I'll go then, if you don't! Just wait and see! Don't waste your time. What are you rehearsing! Right! Go and dub cartoons for a TV station! Damn, don't block her from rehearsing. Go on...! Vivian! Don't worry, I love you! What? I'm serious! Serious! Dare you say that again? I didn't do it intentionally! Did you rehearse at home? Yes! Sing it to me! It's still bad! I've rehearsed for two days! Your mouth's moving, that's not rehearsal! Where are you going? I'm leaving! Don't you want your shoes? I don't compose free, but I'll make an exception! I can't even read notes, I can't sing! Never mind, I'll teach you! From the elementary stage! Can I ever be a singer? Yes, if you've time, I'll devote my full energy! To teach you! One, two! Three nights! I might even spend every day with you! Don't force me, I've no time to compose for youl! I spent over an hour with you over the phone. Now you're coming to me again! Those imps hurled shoes at me, I give up! Now I see why Peggy did that to you! Who's hurling things at who? You have the devil of temper! Even a little sister's forsaking you! Now you have 2 options. Fling them back! Or comply with their wishes! Had a quarrel with Peggy, Alex? Need my help? Girls can talk more frankly! What are you doing sneakily? That bastard who cursed me is there! I was only joking. Don't take it seriously! Stand there, Sonny! Is this your car, sir? Yes! Now I sue you for vandalism! Where are you going? I haven't finished yet! Crazy! The game's over, I'll leave now! Hey, I don't think so! What about you? I think it's not so simple! It's fluorescent paint, it may not be found at night! Come here! Try to sing this! Sing? "In silence my heart rains!" "Who'd care..." In singing use your abdomen! Using the nose sounds like a cold sufferer! Shout several times by holding it here! You'll feel the sound's coming out of here! Try! Again! "In silence the heart rains!" "Who'd care to keep this love?" "It's raining in the wandering winds." "Who'll stick together with warmth and passion?" It's so simple! Welcome to this home El. Appliance repairs class. An electrical appliance is one using electricity! Lesson 1: How to trace cause of damage! Any of you coming out for an experiment? A lady, please come out! Here's a blender!

My phone at home is out of order! I'll send you back in a minute! Okay! But we still have to play a little longer! It's me! I thought it was my daughter! Is she still not back? Just lock the iron gate! Don't worry, your daughter's grown up! Look, we got these for nothing! Would a normal person writer these. I heard those young men seeing erotic videos! Saying "this chick, that chick" so young men take girls for chicks! Like dishes! I also heard those girls saying "doing it with so" this is quite common! Vivian might ruin her life like that! You also get married after you did that! It's different. My husband got paid in advance! It saves time to have a baby after 4 months! It would be bad if vivianhad a child. You'll become grandma then! What... then? One-shot hit! Such a chance is remote! What if it does? What if... Consult ka Kai association then! Family planning association! Or take a trip to shumtsan! Shenzhen! She'll return a new person again! She went with a man... Bye-bye! Rehearse more at home! An adult! Not a child! Don't worry, he has a beautiful car! I must question her! Don't be impulsive unless you want another missing girl! What then? Let me! Have you seen enough? Yes! Mammy! Auntie! No wonder I couldn't get it through! Your daughter's burning with passion! What are you doing? Aren't we going home? No! How high do we have to go up? There are still four more storeys! Are you very tired? Why don't you move back? I want to live alone, with my own home! Move back if you don't live, you still have the key? None loves me more than you do! Did the transportation co help you bring these? No, Alex did! Let me make the introduction! Alex! Earnest! I came to see you because he was late! I know him, I did the 1st ad movie for them! I got an ad for him. We'll co-operate later! How's the match? A perfect pair! What are you doing? Don't get excited, it's not your future son-in-law! I was thinking if moustache came to pick up Vivian, should I get out or not? Be tough if there's nothing between them! Otherwise, let him be tough! Look, what a mess they've made! They're only playing, not kissing! Have you seen mo wai-mun? Was she picked up by a white car? She asked if you've seen mo wai-mun! Mo wai-mun? Teacher lu told her to stay! Teacher lu? Isn't she a lady? How could one with moustache be a lady! It was that moustache who took her home! Maybe she lacks fatherly love! Excuse me...! A teacher-student affair! Round up your mouth if you want a round voice! They're kissing...! Try to breathe! You son of the bitch! Damn you, we've caught you in the act! Who are you? My mammy! Auntie? Stop him! Act tough before he does anything to your daughter! What did you say? What were you doing with my daughter? I'm straight. Did you make love with her? Don't laugh, you were trying to kiss her! You were pawing over her! I was teaching her singing! You were doing it mouth-to-mouth! You've to ride on her in dancing lessons then! Mammy, don't be silly, you don't understand! You're silly, darling! And he tried to fish in troubled waters. Stay! I'll inform to the headmaster against you! Are you really in love with him? Nonsense! You have no common sense! Mammy, I won't see the headmaster! What then? Ask that school attendant! Old gentleman, where's your headmaster? The name of the headmaster is lau, not li! - Where's he? - Well, where's he? I'm here! Your teacher molested my daughter! Which class? Which teacher? That music teacher with moustache! Music teacher? Not my business! - You're irresponsible! - Right! I already have too many responsibilities! Cleaning windows, toilets, sweeping! I'd be stuck if I had to be responsible! For classrooms leased for singing. Mammy, it was no fault of teacher lu! Now she's not blaming him! There's no case. Is that right, madams? She's madam, I'm miss! You went to school without telling me, I'm upset! Don't attend class any more then! I won't feel upset if you don't go! I'm afraid little moustache might bully you! You're now grown, you should be on your guard? He gives me free singing lessons. What's wrong? That's even more dreadful! Why? You're a child, you won't understand! Am I grown up or a child? He sets his eyes on you because you're grown! You'll suffer because you're a girl! I'm worldly, I must protect you! Don't attend that choir, will you? Are you asking me? Yes! Sorry, I must! Vivian, listen, don't see that moustache anymore! Don't beg favors from me! Over there is your room! It's in a mess. Fix it before going to bed! I'm going out with a customer! I'm looking for Alex lu! What's your name, please? “Vivian! Hang on! - Who's it? - Alex, please I want to apologize to you for my mother! Your mammy is a big bore! Don't go away! Keep away, or I'll accuse you of sex harassment! Stop dreaming! You find a talent for me! I must leave! He's so discriminating, he may even turn down Rambo! Only because you're a move producer! It's nice that Alex is here! You did it, don't get Alex involved! What do you mean by that? I'm Dennis! How do you do? Moustache, open up! I know you're jealous because I have... A higher rank and am better-paid. Boss. Dennis won't find a hand for me! Quiet, business thrives on Harmony! I must answer a long distance phone call! Shut up, bitch! That ad must go on the air in 2 weeks. We haven't found one to sing that song yet. Hi. I won't pay for this! Pay by credit card! Any of you heard her sing? Is she ok? Try and you'll see! Relationship counts, not voice alone. Looks okay, she's young! Not young, she can do many things! I can't take your word for it! You must tell her, or she may bother me! No need. I didn't do that! If she knew, she might not agree. It's for your own good to tell her you're not of age. That's too dangerous! That's no concern of yours! Let's go to eat! What are you doing? Mammy! - Give you! - Whats for? A lawyer! We'll win for sure you won't be caned! Mammy, it was not the fault of Mr. lu! Mr. lu, let's calm down first! My daughter looks tall, but she's not of age! Will you let her go? Will you let me go, auntie? Would I ever like your daughter? Don't entangle her if you don't like her. Mrs. mo Alex won't like your daughter, he's gay! Not so loud! Mrs. mo, they're special playboys & playgirls! But we're decent, we don't mix with girls! We only mix with boys! Big sis, can we leave now? What a disgusting tramp, let's go! Madam, I must go out for a while! Mammy, I'm in a hurry! Auntie, bye-bye! Bye-bye! Your daughter may follow that moustache! He turns out to be a gay! They mixed up like girls that day! He doesn't look like a gay! He doesn't look too bad! Why should a man let his moustache grow? Probably to increase his masculine appeal! Even a gay can keep his moustache! He may be a gay, and an "all-purpose plug"! What do you mean? Bisexual! I'll take one day off! Why have you come here? To see my daughter! - Vivian! - Mammy! Are you a singer? Alex told me to tape a song. Don't be in my way! I'm giving Viviana chance to sing this and song! Sit there and listen if you prefer! I'll sit over here. Take care, brother! Alex, I'll go and persuade her! I must deliver the song tomorrow! No problem! Ok, Vivian, start! "It rains in my silent heart!" "Who'd care to keep this love!" "In the wandering winds..." Auntie, can't you hold back your sneeze? Again...! "It rains in my silent heart!" "Who'd care to keep this love?" "In the wandering winds it rains." Sorry! Mammy, please go out or I can't sing! Okay... I'm going out! Again! "It rains in my silent heart, who...!" "It rains in my silent heart, who...!" We can't finish taping this song today! Let's go early for the happy hour! "Who'll keep love with warmth..." Sorry! What now? She can't go on! Let's be off...! Alex - happy hour! Be nice and go home! If you're wrong, say "sorry" to her! She'll forgive you fir sure.

Your dress is on fire on the back! It's now so quiet at home, we can hear mosquitoes hum! What do you hear? The buzz and hum of the mosquitoes! It really gets on my nerves! Well... let me call her for you! Don't be so tough! Okay! Vivian! I'm auntie Jane, your mammy... Can't you see? She was ok, but hung up when I mentioned you! Shall we apologize to moustache?
