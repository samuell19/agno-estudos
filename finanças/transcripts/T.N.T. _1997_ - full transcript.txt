Been some different aboutyou the last few missions. What's wrong? Woman? Alex, this guy, Komati, killed 23 American citizens commandeering this mine, selling uranium to China. What's wrong with you? Huh? Come on. You're right. Let's go to work. Yeah. It's not work. It's justice. I don't need to remind you that there is no room for error. So you get to Komati and you get to him quickly. These warlords will cut off your balls and play marbles with them if they catch you. Understood? I think he likes me. Coming up in 30 seconds. Stand by to jump. MAN [RADIO]: 10 seconds to drop zone. 3, 2, 1. Go. Go, go, go. Stay down. And we have eyes. Sanitize the area. [gunshots] All clear. Hostage. No heroics, Alex. [snoring] Change of orders. We were supposed to bring him back alive. Change of orders. You almost got us killed. There was a change of orders. Oh, yeah? What are you doing? Change of orders. We don't have time for this. The chopper takes offwhether you're there or not. Jesus, Alex. [gunshots] Alex. Just go. Shit, you'd think I gettired of saving your ass. What? You got something better to do? [non-english speech] [screaming] Put him down. We're never gonna make it. Alex, lose the hostage. We are never gonna make it out of here. Put him down. Now, now. Alex, come on. Run! Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Get him on. All right. Let's get this bird out of here. What about Alex and Val? They broke discipline. That was their decision. This is mine. Alex, let me take him. We're never gonna make it. No. Just go and hold the chopper. Go, man! Standby. We've got wounded coming in. Let's get out of here. One minute is all I'm asking for, one minute. Put that away before you hurt someone. You know, if this was the army, you'd be court marshalled again. Hi. I'm Alex. You're expected, sir. Welcome. Right this way. So how was your trip? - Fine. Thank you. Good. Alex, you're alive. Mr. Russo. I don't like getting involvedin decisions at this level, but people count on the TNT,important people, many of them in the US government. But Alex, I cannot havemy two best men bickering over petty differences. I could quit. Oh, you can't quit. There's too much at stake. There's too much to be done. Can I get you a scotch? Huh? Miles, why don't you takea break for a few minutes? Go wait in my office, would you? Miles, a by the book soldier. He'll do anything you ask him toand not a damn thing you don't. And that's the problem. You see, I need men who can think on their feet, react to changing situations,improvise, adapt, overcome. That's why I brought you in from Europe. You will have your own TNTteam, Alex, one day very soon. But in the meantime, Milesis your commanding officer. It's a difficult reality, but the reality is always difficult. Thanks for the drink. Alex, the hostage whose life you saved, he is the general managerof our uranium mine. The people who support the TNT,they know who you are, Alex. And they're not going toforget anyone who's helped them out of a tight spot. Well? I wouldn't let him out of my sight. Gentlemen, meet Carlos Saldivia, Cuban trained leader of the second largest drug cartel in Mexico. Our estimates figure thatin just the last year, half of the Colombian dust snorted or smoked in the southeasternUS netted Carlos $2.3 billion. That's tax free. A very rich man with onlyone vise, his mistress. He visits her in Tampico every Thursday. Naturally, the wife and familyare at home in Mexico City. So everyone in the convoy is fair game. They're late. Maybe they're not coming. They'll be here. Let's just keep alert. OK. All right. You gonna tell me what'sbothering you or what, Alex? I don't trust Russo and I don't trust Miles. Maybe we are doing their dirty work. What makes you say that? I'm not sure we'reworking for the government. All right. Let's say Russo is being dishonest with us. What can you do? Quit. Nobody quits unless Russo wants them to. You know that, Alex. You'd be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life. Yeah, I need to account for four shipments that were supposed to come through our warehouse in Texas. I do business with who and where I want. I no fear you. I fear no one, not even God. They always think they're invincible. And then, they die. Here they come. Show time. All right. What do you got? It's a four unit convoy. I thought there weresupposed to be three vehicles. Nothing's changed. Let's just stick to the plan. One leading. One clean. I got a visual. I am go in 5, 4, 3, 2-- Fire. Hey, Carlos, what's the rush? Finish him, shooter six. Get him before he breaks for the woods. Please, god. No. No. [gunshots] It's not your fault. Alex. Alex, don't. Alex. Alex. Alex. I killed the wife and the kid. And you told me no civilians. Yeah. So? You knew it. Didn't you? You fucking knew it. Yeah. So? Hold it. Alex. Alex. Come on. Come on, Alex. Let's get out of here, man. ALEX [RECORDING]: My name is Alex Cheval. For the past five years, I'vebeen a member of the Tactical Neutralization Team, theprivate armed force financed by the Chaplain Davis Corporation to perform assassination and acts of terrorism. Names, dates, missionprofiles, it's all in here. Plus, he's made copies to send to the media, in case anything happens to him. I told you to watch him. Sir-- No one does this to me. Now, you go out today. You find him right now. And you eliminate him. Sir, he was the best man on the team. And even if we could locate him-- Carrying out orders is what I pay you for. OK? Hey, Murphy. Can you get that tied up by yourself? Yeah. [inaudible] Whoa, whoa, whoa wait. You haven't paid for the trip yet. Hm? I'm gonna go take a shower. Looks like you don't need a shower. I am wet. I am cold. I'm gonna take a shower. So let's go take it together. If we shower together,I will never get to class. Well, you know what's important, don't you? I know that I have 30 psychology students waiting for me. I have to go. ALEX: Don't go. I'll be back in two hours, Sailor. Do you think she like us? Yes, she does. Top of the morning to you, Sheila. Good morning. How's the family? Fine. Hey, Mark. - Hey, Mark. - Hey, guys. What's up? I've been following your diet and I'm really starting to bulk up. Can't you tell? - Yeah. You're looking great. Thanks a lot. See you later. Bye. See you guys. Hey, be careful. Morning, sheriff. Morning. I am the Maytag repair man of law enforcement. That's because of your reputation. See, criminals, they live in fear of you. So they stay away. Is that right? So where's your better half? She's enlightening the youth of this nation. Yeah? When did she give up teaching? I know it's none of mybusiness, but when are you gonna ask that girl to marry you? You're right. It's none of your business. She;s a good girl,Jamie, smart as they come. Although I have seriousdoubts about her taste in men. I think she'd make you very happy. What makes you think she'd even say yes? You got to ask, friend. That's the only way youever get any kind of answer. You gotta ask. I got to go to work. See you. Is there a problem, sheriff? Is this your vehicle? Yeah. SHERIFF: It's a crosswalk. Oh. Sorry. I didn't see the-- the markings. Normally, that's a $15 fine,but this one's on the house. Oh, thanks. I appreciate that. Visiting or passing through? Oh, I'm visiting. Well, enjoy your stay. But obey the parking regulations. We've got some seniors in town who work themselves into a pretty good lather when their crosswalks disappear. [stomach grumbles] [inaudible] OK, everybody, the last 30 seconds. [inaudible] 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Cool down. Nice job, everybody. OK. Everybody, that's it. The same time tomorrow. And don't forget to stretch. All right. BARBARA: Mark. Yeah? I like sweating with you. You're a good coach. Sure. Sweating is good for us all. Yeah. You know, I'm sure you're busymost nights, but, you know, if you ever feel like spendinga couple hours, maybe we could-- Thanks, Barbara, but I'm in a relationship. Oh. Doesn't seem to matter to most people. ALEX: No. I don't suppose it does, but thanks. She is such a slut. Who's that. Boob-bra. The world is a lonely place. Yeah. Well, I doubt she's spenttoo much time alone in it. Hey. It's my dad's birthday today. You didn't mention that. Yeah, well, he says at his age,he's trying to forget them. Sheriff Jim, he can't be much older than what? 70? 75? Look, we're having alittle surprise party tonight at 8 o'clock, Bullwinkles. Mind if I bring Jamie? That'd be OK I guess, just as long as you don't ruin the surprise. Just remember, there's a great jukebox there and I love to have the first slow dance. I don't think Jamie wouldlike that, but it's OK. I think a little jealousy'sgood for a relationship. That one's mine. Hey, hey. You guys look like a couple of smart kids. Ever seen this guy before? And if we did? Uh, well, an extra candy bar for you. Never saw him before in my life. Ow. ALEX: Well, let's play Blackjack. Another one? [bark] OK. What about another? [dog whines] Just checking. I'm tired of losing all the time. So what do you get if you win? He buys the groceries for the week. Thanks. SHERIFF: You're welcome. Well, I guess I should wish you a happy-- oops. Birthday? That's all right. I already know about the surprise party. Carrie doesn't know I know. Oh, but I know. She tried, put it off to the last minute, hoping she could fool me, butshe's pretty much hopeless. You know, I've been thinking about what you said this morning. And I've done things I'm not very proud of. No convictions. No outstanding warrants. And you never served any time. You checked me out. I check out everybodythat moves into this town. It's nothing personal. It was before I knew you. I feel I can't reallyask Jamie to marry me if I don't tell her about my past. And if I do, I'm not sure she will marry me. I'm not sure she will talk to me again. Just exactly what did you do? [music playing] Well, you're gonna have to tellher about it sooner or later, because the past has a wayof jumping out of the bushes and biting you in the asswhen you least expect it. Hey, Jim. Hi yourself. ALEX: Hi, honey. Hi, baby. You know, I'd like to stay, but I gotta run. I know the two of youget plenty to talk about. And I've got a surprise birthday party to go to. Yeah? Whose? Mine. So what? What do we have to talk about? Do you want to go to Jim'sbirthday party tonight? JAMIE: Yeah. ALEX: Good. Well, let me get dressed. [SINGING] For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly goodfellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny. SHERIFF: Thank you. I appreciate that. You know, I always admiredpeople who could carry a tune. And you can't. Don't ever quit your day job. You've got a lot to say for an old man. Why not use some of that hot air on the candles? Oh, I love this song. Let's go dance. What about the cake? It'll be here when we get back. Save me a big piece. Oh, I'll keep you a big one. JAMIE: Cut me off a corner. All right. Pass me a few plates and I'll serve everybody. OK. Really do look like theybelong together, don't they? Not all that much they don't. Hey. Want another round? OK. $3.50. All right. How about now? You count it. It's all there. He promised me his first dance. Well, if he promised you the first dance, we can't disappoint him, can we? No. I know what you're worried about. You think I'm too young. So does your father. And he has a gun. Hi. Hi. Can I get a couple beers please? Yeah. Sure. Are you with the party? - Yeah. Great. I'll put it on the tab. Here you go. - Thank you. Bye. Whoa, whoa, whoa now. This is where you belong, sweetheart. The sheriff is right over there. Yeah. Well, let him get his own woman. Excuse me. We're not looking for trouble, gentlemen. Then, go away. Which part of go away don't you understand? I'm not here to fight, guys. Oh, now, I see why they call it gay Paris. Oops. Look like I spilled a little. Excuse me. Boy, I think that's about enough, don't you? Hey, sheriff. He started it, sheriff. I know you boys probablywant to apologize to Mark here, don't you? Sorry. Course, I know for afact, he wouldn't accept it. So just leave it be and sit down. Yes, sheriff. Thank you, Jim. That was a very noble thing to do. They're jerks. What else can you say? Nothing. [phone ringing] Yeah? Sir, this is Basu. RUSSO [PHONE]: Well? I found him. Refresh my memory a moment, won't you, Basu? Sir. Is this the fifth timeyou found him or the sixth? No, no, no. This time, I really found him. Is that so? You showed some real restraint there, friend. You know, I have a lectureto give in the morning at 9:00. I haven't even started to prepare it. So maybe we should go. OK. It's good to see you guys again. Good night. Good night, Mark. Happy birthday, Jim. Bye. Excuse me a minute. I need to confer with my deputy. Nice party, huh? [SINGING] For he's a jolly good fellow. He's a jolly good fellow. I'm a jolly good fellow. Why would anybody want to deny? Messed up bad, man. I'm gonna kick your ass. Why is it that every time Idisappear, something happens? Come on back, chicken shit. [phone ringing] Hello? [dial tone] [phone ringing] Hello?

OK. I'll see you there. JAMIE [PHONE]: Bye. I'll say this for tapping phones, it's gotten a hell of alot easier since the days when you had to actually goto somebody's home to do it? Who's the woman? There's her number, about minutes and I'll have everything on her, right down to her mother's maiden name. Meantime, let's take a picture. ALEX [PHONE]: I was just thinking about stopping by before you go to school. JAMIE [PHONE]: OK. ALEX [PHONE]: I'll see you there. JAMIE [PHONE]: Bye. Conversation just now. And the conversation you hadwith Alex in this offense for the mission down in Mexico. Mhm. Perfect match. Mhm. OK. Just-- just what are the odds of two men having the same voice print? About the same as me becoming the pope. Not likely. Where we going? Colorado. What's the OP? Taking down Alex. You got a problem with that? Why would I have a problem with that? Well, I don't expect him togo down without a serious fight. I can't risk insubordination. We're all professionals here, Miles, all of us. Good. Look around you, Mark. This is where I grew up. This is who I am just,everything out in the open. No secrets. I've been with you for almost a year now. How much do I really know about you? I mean, really? It's so great when we're together. I love being with you. But last night, you were likea complete stranger to me. There is so much about you that I don't know. What you don't know about meis not worth knowing, Jamie.

Tell her whatever she wants to hear, even what you won't tell me. And then, pop the question. Try the small one. Alex, don't. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nice shooting. Thanks, Jim. You know what makes Alex trulydangerous is the way he thinks. He won't come in the way we expect him to. He knows we'll be channelingour efforts there. He won't come in the second way either. He'll know that we'll at least have that covered. No. We'll be coming in a third way. Stay with her, but not too close. Don't worry, boss. I got her. And that's where we'll be waiting for them. Yeah. We'll just have to resistthe temptation of blowing his brains out til we at least know he has the tapes, all the tapes. But we can still fuck him up, right? Of course. Shit. Where is she?
