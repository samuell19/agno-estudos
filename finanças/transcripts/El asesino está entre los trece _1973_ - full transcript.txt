The Killer is Among the Thirteen Will it be long? I don't think so. It's been nearly three hours since we passed the last town This area is endless I'm impatient, I can't wait to get there She was very generous in inviting us, don't you think? 1 still can't explain it, we hardly know her We're not the only guests, that car's going the same way we are This area is strange, it seems like they must get cut off from the rest of the world at times It's pretty but I would have preferred not to come It was hard to find an excuse, besides, it was all in the past, it's absurd to go back over bad memories I'm thinking I could get something out of this trip - Good day sir - Hello If I'm not mistaken you're Mr. Stephen, the lady of the house is expecting you You're still the same marvelous woman you always were Don't think you'll be able to flatter me Harry Stephen, I've memorized all your old seductive tricks And even though your admirers might not see it, you're older than the last time we saw each other Come Lisa, don't try to defend yourself by attacking With men like you no precautions are enough If you'd allow me 1 was looking forward to your arrival. I trust your trip was pleasant - A bit difficult - Jorge is a very cautious driver, I always wonder why he wants such an expensive car. In any case, we're here now - Toby, unload the luggage - Right away sir You have a magnificent pad here Mrs. Mandel - Do you mean the house? - Of course How many times do I have to tell you not to use those vulgar expressions? Allow me to introduce you to a friend Mr. Harry Stephen, Mr. and Mrs. Fon Delighted to meet you Mr. Stephen Please Francis - What Mother? - Instead of staring at that poor servant you should help your cousin Lisa welcome the rest of the guests, they're about to arrive. We're her only family and that should be very clear to everyone Yes Mother We were surprised by the invitation too, we barely know Mrs. Mandel We're in the same situation, I hadn't heard from her in months, since the death of her husband - A flying accident, right? - Yes, it was two years ago He crashed into the sea while crossing the English Channel on a night flight I understand he was a magnificent sportsman Yes, and an extraordinary attorney I'm happy to be here, the house is lovely. We'll have a good time these next few days Of course, the Mandel's had a considerable fortune - Are you done friend? - Yes sir - Now if you won't be needing me... - You can go. Here Thank you very much sir, but it's not necessary The mistress wouldn't like it Excuse me This man's a prude. I'm starting to get tired of feeling restricted And I'm getting tired of your lack of morals You won't stop being vulgar You have to understand this is an elegant place and you must match the surroundings 1 told you when we met her that Mrs. Mandel was a woman with class and not just her, the young man she introduced us to also seemed very chic Who? Harry Stephen? He seems full of himself to me Of course you've been finding every young man marvelous for a while now Again with your vulgarities. It'd be nice if you'd remember sometimes that you're not a simple 9 to 5 merchant anymore, now you're the owner of Fon Cannery and you should act according to your position. 1 don't know if you know it but among elegant people jealousy is boorish I might be as boorish as you imagine, but it bothers me that you flirt with that imbecile Jorge, sometimes I think you'd be better off behind a counter Come closer You're very pretty, but the headdress doesn't suit you You see? That's better. What's your name? Elena sir A lovely name, almost as lovely as you So Elena... - what do you do on your days off? - We don't have days off sir We're so isolated here that there's no place to go A shame I would have liked to go out with you You gave me quite a fright Ernez, I thought you were looking after the guests The mistress sent me to get her aunt's coat, it seems the old lady's cold. It seems like I got here just in time - 1 don't know what you mean - No? It's very clear My friend Harry Stephen, a sporting colleague of my husbands Harry, Mr. and Mrs. Gills Mrs. Parolli and Ms. Hovet You already know Mr. and Mrs, Martin I have to say that though I came to this home due to it's owner's beauty I never expected to find a reunion of such attractive women I'm grateful for the compliment Mr. Stephen, unfortunately the number of married women is high and that will make choosing easier Of course, though there's no greater pleasure than that of forbidden fruit I have the feeling my friend, that you possess a strange sense of humor You have to forgive Harry, he's always like that, Now if you'll excuse us a moment An impulsive man, don't you think? And somewhat excessive At least that's my personal opinion You have to more careful about what you say Harry, Mr. Gills is tremendously jealous That makes flirting more delightful You're incorrigible Aunt, I don't know if you know Mr. Stephen, he was Carlos' good friend Harry, this is Aunt Bertha, sister of my husband's father Harry, this is my cousin Francis - It's a pleasure to meet you Mr. Stephen - The pleasure is mutual I don't think I finished telling you about the state of the cannery business last time Please Jorge, you'll bore Mr. Stephen Of course, but if you'll allow me to give you some advice my friend, you mustn't let business take up all your attention, your wife would be grateful You'll have to excuse us, I still have to present Stephen to the last of the guests I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Harry Stephen Mr. Arlen - Enchanted - I's a pleasure Mr. Arlen is a great artist, though one that's currently unappreciated I'm afraid, but it won't be long before we see his paintings in every museum I hope so, though to be honest my friend Arlen... You haven't said anything about the magnificent guests your cousin invited I don't know where she could have gotten them The only people with class are the Gills though they're completely broke, not a cent. I hear he would bet on the races and she'd spend the rest of it on clothes and now they can't even pay a tailor 1 won't be the whole world's laughingstock and by no means will I tolerate this morning's flirtations to be repeated - That sort of man has no right to live - Don't be absurd, what you're saying makes no sense. Haven't you seen he flirts with everyone? - What do I care about the others! - Please, try to calm down I understand that your nervous, that these economic problems are grave, but that doesn't mean you can take it out on me Do you think they don't affect me? Did you see the jewels and clothes on the others? - How long I've been wearing this dress? - Don't try to put the blame on me! And speaking of money, we can't forget that nouveau riche Jorge Fon Oh my heavens, I've never seen anyone $0 common Of course his wife still beats him, she tries to act so fine- Can't you stay still? There's no way to dress you properly Forgive me mother And another one who's no angel is that young and attractive Martha Hovet Her face seems familiar, I've spent all day trying to recall where I've seen her before There's no doubt she's a typical gold digger, looking for a man with money She wouldn't fool anyone with her chainstore dresses 1 tell you this because I know you like those sort of shameless girls hunting for rich men If you paid attention to me you'd spend your time on Lisa, she has money, your age, just about and when everything's said and done you're cousins Your obligation is to get her away from that skid row Don Juan Harry Stephen - Shut up idiot, it's me - You gave me a terrible fright, it's almost night and dinner is set to start in a quarter hour 1 want you to go to the pool house tonight after everyone goes to bed, I need to speak with you -1 can't do that, they might see me - If it was that idiot Harry you'd go Inthe end... it didn't turn out marvelously but it's quite good Go on, look at yourself in the mirror You're very handsome I believe that at this moment the most logical thing is to make a toast to the person who's gathered us together in such a pleasant way I'm grateful Harry, but I'm afraid you have the wrong person The true planner of this reunion isn't among us Sadly, we can't count on his presence Naturally, I mean Carlos, my husband You're right Lisa. Let's toast to the memory of he who was a friend to all of us, the great attorney and excellent sportsman Carlos Mandel Well, now after the toast I have something to reproach you for Lisa I don't know if you've noticed... - but there are 13 of us - And besides, it's still... the 13th Yes, and I'd regret if that detail would bother someone I know there are many superstitious people but it couldn't be any other way Perhaps it'd be a surprise to you but I've spent two long years trying to gather all of you - around this table - Atleast for me itis, and I have an honest desire to know the reasons for your invitation From what you've said it seems like it's more than a simple social gathering I have no problem in letting you know Perhaps you don't remember... but today is the second anniversary of my husband's death and I've tried to gather all those people for whom his death might have had some significance I'm convinced that Carlos didn't die in an accident like is said, rather that his death was something premeditated by someone who is among us at this moment In few words my friends, one of you is my husband's killer Ifthis is a joke, and I expectit is, it's not funny. I don't understand your logic I have no choice but to demand an immediate explanation I'm sorry to tell you that this is no joke I repeat that apparently my husband's death was accidental As all of you know, his plane crashed when crossing the English Channel in a night flight between London and Paris but I have evidence that it was actually a meticulously planned crime - Could you tell us of them? - Firstly there's a witness who saw a man enter my husband's apartment one hour before his flight took off I don't understand how a simple visit could make you think it was a crime, and if it was a man, how are all the women present related to this? Especially the two who have no relation to the gentlemen here I mean Ms. Hovet and myself You know very well, Mrs. Parolli, that you couldn't be defined as an unattached woman What are you trying to say? I don't think I need to explain it to you but that's not important now The witness spoke of a man because he was dressed in a coat, hat, scarf and sunglasses It's clear that he was trying in every way not to be recognized That being the case, any woman could pass as a man dressed like that - Just a moment! - Please Jorge, calm down! I want to say this is absurd, it has no rhyme or reason I don't know if this is some parlor game I don't understand. If it is, well fine, but I want it to be clear that Jorge Fon of Fon Cannery is a respectable man like it when black is black and white is white and damn anyone who says I go around rubbing people out! Logically there are other important details On the morning of the crime my husband took a large sum of money from the bank, 10,000 pounds That money hasn't appeared That doesn't mean anything. If you're husband went down with the plane and his remains haven't turned up, that money must be deep under the sea You see, the empty envelope that contained the money was in the apartment, the bank's employee recognized it Besides, Carlos didn't need to bring money, he had an account in Paris It's clear to me that those 10,000 pounds were meant for his mysterious visitor Man, just what was missing, now she's accusing us of being thieves 1 don't know what 10,000 stinking pounds are supposed to mean to me, I have millions - This woman is out of her mind - Be quiet or you'll have to deal with me What Lisa said is very serious, this is no time to be rude So Lisa, you're insinuating that the motives for the crime were monetary? It's possible, but knowing the motive would be the same as knowing who the killer is It's something I can't guess at the moment It's also possible that what the killer stood to gain from the crime was much more than 10,000 pounds I believe you're referring to your cousin or I now dear It's true that Francis was Carlos' only heir, but only in the event you died too Fortunately you enjoy enviable good health, and besides, neither Francis nor I need money Please Aunt, you know very well that's not true I want to be clear that money might not be the only motive My husband and I loved each other madly, but though it pains me to say it he tended to cheat on me frequently They were just fleeting affairs of course, but in the end wouldn't it be possible that a jealous husband or a scorned woman caused his death? Man, just what we needed, now we're being painted as cuckolds For me the crime is just a hypotheses but once accepted, our accuser Mrs. Mandel is the prime suspect In the first place, she's her husband's direct heir and she's just confessed that she knew that he cheated on her frequently Naturally this is all hearsay, for my part I say there's no shred of evidence of this hypothetical crime What's more, we still don't even know how it was carried out Yes, but there is a murder weapon In the apartment's sink there remained two unwashed cups and there was residue of some barbiturate in one of them The analyst did a very careful study of the quantity It wasn't a fatal dose, but it was enough so that within an hour my husband would fall asleep at the controls of the plane It's evident that the killer, if there was one, did things very carefully so no one would ever find out that there was a crime The first thing that drew my attention was the money Carlos took from the bank There was no reason he'd need that much in cash The mysterious visit and the disappearance of the money made me suspicious Besides, my husband was nervous in his final days, worried about something All these details led me to carry out a careful investigation Among other things the coffee cups were analyzed and that's how the existence of the sleeping pills was discovered I still don't understand how we're all related to this business Where there's a crime there's a criminal, someone interested in Carlos' death His work as an attorney and his love life were the two most logical possibilities, apart from the monetary reasons, of course For example, the first person who could have a relationship with my husband in his professional capacity is Mr. Arlen Please, bring me the painting In just a few moments I'll show you something interesting but first you might want to know that my first meeting with Mr. Arlen was in one of his exhibitions where I bought a painting And by the way Mr. Arlen, isn't it true I was the only buyer? Yes, it's true, but that doesn't worry me I make my art for myself, not for a bourgeois audience lacking all sensibility I'm an artist, not a businessman I congratulate you Frankly, I don't understand a thing, it just looks like scribbling to me This is the painting I bought at the exhibition though my principal motive was to meet Mr. Arlen 1 think the work is magnificent and I'm delighted to possess it This changes my plans I didn't expect so much sensibility from someone of the feminine persuasion I'm grateful for your change of opinion though perhaps you might be interested to know that this isn't the only painting of yours that I'm the owner of But... that's impossible Nothing is impossible Mr. Arlen I like this one, I think it's good That painting isn't mine, I've never painted copies or forgeries That it's a forgery and a very good one at that there's no doubt, nor is there any that when it was sold they attempted to trick the buyer An art dealer named Jourdain sold it in Paris to a British client of my husbands, Sir Francis Wilson. When he sought expert advice he discovered the forgery Sir Francis charged my husband with filing a complaint in Paris against the dealer That was the reason for his trip. Naturally he couldn't carry out his charge and two weeks later Jourdain turned up dead, drowned in one of the floodgates in the Seine When they checked his documents, the French police found a long history of forgeries A fascinating story... which has nothing to do with me Sir Francis bought the painting in February of 1970 and on Jourdain's books there's record of payments to an unknown painter whose initials are two AAs, for four paintings The sum was 10,000 francs and the date December 1969 According to my reports you personally took four paintings to Paris on that date Jourdain charged the pretty sum of 100,000 francs for the paintings, -40 times more than he paid you - The cad! In my opinion it's as well painted as the other My heavens, imagine buying that other atrocity No offense intended Mr. Fon, but I believe your forte is business, not critique Business like the Northern Cannery, anonymous society Of course, that's one of my businesses, I acquired majority share two and a half years ago And in a very effective way, if you'll permit me saying so Slowly at first and through third parties later and once you had enough to be able to control the administrative board you created a false bankruptcy, that way you could buy the rest of the shares A clever stock operation that ruined many people and that caused a considerable loss to a client of my husbands I knew sooner or later I'd get what was coming to me I suppose, madam, that you'll be able to prove all that I don't think I'm the person for that, but isn't it true that my husband saw you in your office the day of the accident and told you that he had proof of false accounting in your business? Gentlemen, I won't stand to be assaulted with all this nonsense, I'm leaving! Wait! Please Mr, Fon, sit back down Needless to say, both Mr. Arlen as well Mr. Fon were in London the day of the crime and according to my reports, the rest of you were there as well or could get there easily I have to contradict you Lisa, I wasn't in London and I don't understand why you have to mix me up in all of this I was a good friend of Carlos' I also have to disagree, I wasn't in London nor have I ever had any relationship with your husband I have no substantial proof, though I believe you were in England at the time, but responding to your last claim Mrs. Parolli I'll say that your fiancee was a client of my husbands You had just met and spoke of your upcoming wedding It's not strange at all that your fiancee, given his position, investigated your life and he left the matter to Carlos He discovered you weren't a widow like you claimed, rather divorced, and certain unsavory details of your previous life But now you have nothing to fear, Carlos' death kept him from informing his client I admit to the divorce, I told him myself a few days later I expect you understand my misgivings, today in English society doesn't easily accept that sort of thing I spoke of your previous life, and that if it were discovered your marriage would not take place I await your accusation, but don't tell me your eye never wandered Of course not, for you love isn't nearly the most important thing - What do you mean by that? - Simply that money is your main objective You're proud and won't allow anyone to keep you from a girl or to interfere with your plans - Wasn't that what happened with Carlos? - Speak clearly, what are you insinuating? What you've heard You went to London to see one of your lovers, a married woman Carlos didn't just steal her from you, but also discovered your relationship with another woman, a relationship you expected and still expect to reap great benefits from, and those two women are among us at this moment Mrs. Mandel, though my terrible secret has been discovered I'm happy, you've presented us with an enchanting farce, dirty business, marriages of convenience, elegant gigolos, a delight May I ask you if, young lady, given your status as a wealthy heir are you the one who plans to keep Mr. Stephen the rest of his days? - You're hateful! - That's intolerable Arlen Please gentlemen, calm down I think it's been enough for the moment 1 wish you all a good night - Is it you? -Yes It's madness to have come here, anyone could find us I've locked the door. No guest knows the pool house opens at night There's nothing to fear You'd prefer that fool Stephen, won't let him lay a hand on you You'll do what I say I love you Stop acting like an idiot, I'm telling you we're not leaving And I'm telling you it's the only logical thing, I won't stay here a minute more enduring her insults No one has insulted us, she hasn't referred to us in particular She's within her rights to speak about her husband's death, my conscience is clear and I hope you can say the same Now you're insulting me How could you think I'd be capable of committing a crime No, not a crime... but adultery, yes - Guillermo, I won't have you- - Let's speak clearly Lisa spoke of a married woman, a lover of her husband and of Harry Stephen and as far as I know there are only three possible candidates I'm determined not to leave until things are cleared up As you wish. You win but remember that you'll be the one bearing the responsibility But mother, I thought- That I was asleep. Well, I'm not, May I know where you're coming from? You see, I... I was taking a stroll through the garden I knew that, all that's needed is to look at your shoes And was something interesting happening in the pool house? - What? - In the pool house! - In the pool house? - I'm not blind I was also looking out the window when that shameless maid went in that direction - and of course you went right after her - Mother, I swear I didn't- Don't swear dear, it doesn't ring true I've seen what you're up to with that girl, but that's not the worst of it No, really Mother... She was going there, I followed her out of curiosity It was the chauffeur waiting for her there I'll have to speak with your cousin about this The chauffeur? - Then you-? Francis, you're a pig! - Mother... Quit saying Mother, I say it and it stands Go to bed immediately. Tomorrow we'll deal with this matter Very well. Yes Mother And clean your shoes before going to sleep Yes Mother... I had to eliminate you Mr. Martin because your position was quite dangerous I congratulate you. In spite of your youth I see you've mastered this old game Go on Mrs. Parolli, one more strike and you'll have won the match You did it I congratulate you, you've been a perfect partner We need to talk. I'm going to my room to change, I'll expect you in a quarter hour - Thank you very much Mr, Stephen - You play too well for us Aim and gauging a shot aren't my forte The truth is I haven't played since I left college but it's lovely to remember the old games, don't you think? Of course, and besides, you play stupendously Of course, facing a professional like Mr. Stephen the rest of us have little chance - Let's just say I'm a professional amateur - Don't be modest Stephen, we know you were a great champion What times those were, now I couldn't even handle a bat I'm sorry about last night I meant what that stuck up painter said about you and Mr, Stephen It's not important, I had forgotten it In any case, Harry Stephen is a terribly handsome man, the only one here worth the while, well, if we don't count the caretaker You're right, he seems like the most likely to be with a rich widow Do you know that for being so young you have a very perverse mind? Food should be ready within half an hour, it'll be served in 45 minutes Oh, and remember to switch Mr. Stephen and Mr. Arlen's places at the table Is it true what they told me about last night's dinner? I don't know what you're talking about but I advise you not to ask questions, the mistress wouldn't like it I'm sorry Do you know if Mrs. Parolli has come down from her room? 1 don't think so, I would have seen her come out Very well, return to your post We should be more careful, especially in these circumstances - Some marvelous circumstances - Stop being smug If 1 asked you to come it's for something important, It's clear Lisa knows about us - and every detail of your former life - And perhaps of yours I'm afraid so, at least a large part, and that could change everything if it becomes public. The wedding, the money, all of our plans - But that's not the worst thing - What could be worse? That killer, the man who killed Carlos Mandel Lisa is right, though I fear her suspicions are far off I know who it is, and he knows I know his identity - Then you think it's a man - Of course, but for now he feels secure He knows that if I reveal whoit is I'd go down with him You have to help me Yes, but how? At least tell me who itis Not now, it's a long story, something about my life you don't know about It's dangerous to be together much longer, the walls have ears and I'm sure he's spying on us. Tonight I'll go to the pool house and tell you about it Tomorrow I won't be here anymore, - you'll be free to act - Alright We have to stop seeing each other for a long while, until the wedding's over and everything is forgotten 1 don't know why we're still here, we should leave immediately since we didn't last night You said it, we didn't do it and that indicates something Will you allow me a moment Ms, Hovet, I'd like to speak with you Yes, of course I'd like to apologize for last night, it wasn't my intention to offend you - Well you did - I'm sorry, I truly am It was a joke in poor taste There are jokes and then there are jokes Mr, Arlen Did you know my wife from before? - Well - Tell me honestly Honestly, no, but keep this between ourselves And to tell the truth I regret it because... your wife is a real beauty Please ma'am, could you give me a moment? It's about the food Excuse me For me it's clear that Mrs. Mandel, in these recent years has tried to create friendships with all of us. I met her in London, at a fashion show We met her in a party in Paris, and you Mrs. Martin? We didn't know her, she invited us due to our old friendship with her husband Forgive me ma'am, the documents you were expecting have just arrived I've seen the employee of the agency off Thank you Henry, you can go You'll have to forgive me, it's about a matter of the greatest importance to me, something related to our conversation last night That means it could also be important to us You're right. It's a report I had requested from an investigation agency to detail your movements the day of my husband's death The report indicates that most of you have some unaccounted hours from 7 to 9 that day Given the time that's gone by it hasn't been easy to investigate Both my wife and I were in a meeting in Paris I know Mr. Martin, but Paris is very close to London, it's easy to come back by plane I insist that I have nothing to do with this matter, I wasn't in London that day The Quinan Hotel on Greek St. doesn't mean anything to you? It's close to Soho Square, an important tourist spot If that hotel doesn't ting a bell Mrs. Parolli, there's a hotel register with your name on it that fateful day Better said, under the name of Lucy Forlani Isn't that your married name? You have no right to meddle in our private affairs You're right, but I don't see another way to resolve this matter I don't yet know the identity of the killer but sooner or later he'll make a mistake - Or he'll kill again if he feels cornered - Mrs. Parolli is right, the time has come for us who are innocent to leave this place Veiled accusations against many people have been raised here and possible motives have been alleged but in my judgment, both in my wife's case as well as my own there does not exist a reason to justify the crime Man, it's very clear: jealousy Laura, I want you to say before everyone if you had anything to do with Carlos Mandel You didn't tell us you were expecting someone I have no idea who it could be Does this jar belong to one of you? I found it in the garden It has a white substance inside No one can bother us here. Speak up Henry, I want to know what you've learned A few things. I checked the guests' rooms Harry Stephen is armed, I found a revolver among his clothes Ms. Hovet only brought four outfits and very little money I imagined something like that. Go on Nothing of interest in the Martin's room, Guillermo Gills and his wife are in a real economic crisis, I found a letter in the woman's purse from a lender who demands 2000 pounds and threatens to inform her husband Did you leave it in its place? Of course Nothing important in the Fon's room, in Francis'... a great quantity of pornographic pictures and magazines, real filth and besides, the maids complain about his attentions Yes, I had noticed The case of Amadeo Arlen is surprising, he didn't bring luggage, only a notepad and pencils In Cecila Parolli's room... there's nothing of interest, except that this morning one of the maids surprised Mr. Stephen as he was coming out of her room The maid? I thought you were in charge of watching them Naturally I wasn't the one who told her to do it What happened is that... that girl is infatuated with Harry Stephen and follows him everywhere Later she mentioned it and I searched the room - And you didn't find anything? -No It's a shame There's something my husband discovered about the identity of her husband, a high class thief that had escaped from an American prison An extraordinarily capable man... knowing his identity would be of great importance, perhaps the key to everything AllI know is that they still see each other and that he demands money in exchange for his silence Well I haven't found anything... yet I hope you'll forgive me for last night, Mr. Arlen misunderstood my words, I wasn't referring to you Naturally dear, we all understood it very well A young woman as intelligent as Ms. Hovet would be incapable of maintaining a man, and besides, at her age and being so attractive, I don't know, it'd be ridiculous, perhaps if it was reversed Only a person as eccentric as Mr. Arlen could have such a senseless idea Exactly, and you know very well Mrs. Gills that to maintain a lover you need a lot of capital I don't think what's said about Mr, Stephen is true, he seems like an enchanting man to me Too much, don't you think? I don't think it's worth talking about something so unpleasant again Couldn't we talk about something else? Of course. Why don't you tell us about your life Ms. Hovet? I've already told you that my father is an industrialist, rich but very miserly and that I have little money. He only sends me enough to live on I prefer to see the world than to stay at home Very good. I know those sort of parents, they don't give their children a cent, and if they can, they exploit them - I don't understand you - Try to remember, didn't he make you work as a waitress in his hotel? I remember it perfectly, the Hotel Majestic in St. Tropez Wasn't it there where you met my nephew Carlos three years ago? We arrived as he was leaving. Poor Francis is crazy about pretty girls like you and I have a good memory for faces Personally, I'm sure of my wife, I don't want to know a thing I had and have a total confidence in Sylvia, but the truth is Mandel tried to seduce her, I know nothing happened between them but after the trip I cut off my relationship with Mandel I agree with what Mr. Martin said, I'm also sure of my wife Among distinguished people such as ourselves jealousy is a vulgarity That's funny, really funny. That's just nonsense Mr. Fon Itisn't nonsense, and I fail to see any humor in it. Besides, who are you to laugh? A plagiarist, a canvas scribbler Better to scribble on canvas than to sell rotten fish Please gentlemen, there's no reason to fight. Everyone including me is nervous but lets keep our composure, we have an very important matter to resolve I've had enough of this I think he's right, there's no sense in talking further I'll be leaving too, I need to rest I asked you a question Stephen That evidently wasn't answered It's absurd to keep pretending My father is rich industrialist, I don't have a cent Yes, I was a waitress in a hotel and there I met Ca- Well, Mr. Mandel After that I never saw him again You have no reason to be ashamed of your origin or of your previous job, - it's as honorable as any other - Yes dear. By the way, now that you dedicate yourself to traveling, can we know where your income is from? - 1... work -Yes Ma'am, the way you've accosted this girl is intolerable Come, let's go for a walk Please don't cry, the worst is over I shouldn't have lied, it was stupid, but I was ashamed among people like you to tell you I was just a waitress Don't think about that anymore Calm down, then act as if nothing had happened Would you like to be alone? Yes please. I'm very grateful for what you've done for me Martha - Can I tell you something? - Of course This reunion has been very timely The case hasn't been forgotten like has been said. I have a friend in Scotland Yard It seems that the investigation has been opened again - Then what's the point of this whole- - This whole comedy? 1 don't know. It could be a matter of getting new information or to eliminate someone very dangerous In that case, the main suspect would be Lisa Of course, Mr. Martin said it clearly during dinner I'm determined to find out the truth no matter what Would you like to help me? - I wouldn't know- - It'd be very simple, you'll see It's the funniest thing I've heard in my life That's nothing, have you heard the one about a man who caught a mermaid and told her - Three of spades - Four of hearts - Five of diamonds - I have nothing, you go dear Thank you Mr. Fon, I've been waiting for that card for a long time Lady's canasta I'm sorry partner, ['ve made a mess of it. Maybe next time You're admirable Mrs. Parolli, we have the game won - Is something wrong? - No, nothing - Harry, would you like to take a walk? - I'd be delighted, the truth is I didn't dare to suggest it How terrible, we're completely soaked It's a real downpour, I'm drenched - Do you have a handkerchief? - I think so It's stopped raining. Let's go back to the house I need to speak to you, I've discovered something - What is it about? -1 need to confirm it, I can't tell you anything yet. Tomorrow, before anyone gets up, we'll meet in the library, at seven You see dear, it's simple. Two to the right and one backwards I beg you to forgive me, I'm interested in this history of English painting, may I read it in my room? Of course Mr, Arlen, it's at your disposal I'm grateful A curious individual He'll hear you Then we'll meet at seven - Good evening Mrs. Fon - Hello Henry Have you seen my husband? Mr. Fon is in the library at the moment playing a game of poker I'd be grateful Henry, if you brought me some hot punch, I've gotten a bit wet Right away ma'am Come in - Your punch ma'am - Thank you Henry you've been very kind If the lady doesn't need me I'll take the dress to the maid to be ironed If it wouldn't bother you you can take the shoes as well By your leave ma'am At midnight? Yes, but I've found a better place, the cellar Agreed - Will you leave tomorrow? - Of course, I want to be far away from here when everything is uncovered if you dare reveal what I tell you - I'm no coward. So long - Good night My Elena, what a pleasant surprise Does the gentlemen desire something? I've told you you look much better without the headdress You know what I'm thinking? - That you could do me a favor - Yes sir, what the gentleman wants Give me a kiss - Another? - As many as the gentleman wants Not here please, they could find us. I'll wait for you in the pool house - Alright, in half an hour -You'll go? What do you think? This afternoon while we were drinking coffee I talked to everyone about it I want it to come from my lips before it's distorted by someone else It seems like a good idea to me but forget it, it's a good idea to forget bad memories for good Yes, I know it's better to forget but sometimes they come back and there's no way to avoid them I'm S orry ) I'm truly sorry No, it's not that I've been thinking about it all evening - I was selfish asking you to marry me - Don't say such things It's true, you've sacrificed your life to a man older than you, I know Don't think such nonsense. You should forget what happened I assure you I'm completely happy Jorge, I think we should leave, I'm very uncomfortable in this house Tonight's dinner was peaceful, as peaceful as sheep, and you were having a ball this evening I'm tired and bored, the sooner we leave the better I don't understand the hurry. By the way, though I know that jealousy is vulgar and common don't think that Stephen and you are going too far? Of course, always the same tune Stephen is an idiot, a stuck up pretentious Don Juan You were laughing with him a lot this evening Well yes, at first I found his gallantries and stupid jokes amusing but he ended up boring me If it worries you there's no reason for it, I won't look at him again Do what you want, but I don't think it's such a big deal It isn't easy to understand how you've changed your opinion so quickly Hello Elena I'm here, as you can see I keep my promises 1 only came to tell you we should forget what happened, I don't know what you must think of me The only thing I can think is that you're a lovely gir! Let me go please, it's best we leave Don't even dream of it - Did they see you go out? - Of course not Are you afraid of someone finding out? If he knew he'd kill me Well now, I didn't count on that. Who is he? Hernez the chauffeur, but I don't love him, he's a brute Today I finally made things clear with that Martha that has your head spinning I know that waitresses are your specialty and it's a shame, because you're a good boy Yes Mother Nothing bothers me more than people who won't stay where they belong Yes Mother I hadn't told you yet, but I think I have a very clear idea of who the person your cousin is trying to uncover As always my good visual memory served me well Do you remember the theft of Lady Mortimer's jewels? - No Mother - You're useless Anyway, I have the impression that there are various interwoven stories in this Besides, there are many loose ends that don't tie up Your cousin has been following the wrong path in this from the start I don't understand you Mother That's no surprise. Those 10,000 pounds worry me What would Carlos want them for? Then there was that tournament that Harry Stephen took partin You'll forgive me if I leave right away, I have to resolve a matter of great importance With so much coming and going they'll see you and if I'm discovered... I'd defend you You have a meeting with another woman? Not at all. 1 think, little one, that you value me too highly Will you take me with you when you leave? We'll see, everything in its own time - Goodbye little one - Goodbye Cecilia No, don't do this, no! The lady called? - You could knock at least - What for? Anyone here wouldn't be surprised at seeing you this way 1 won't have you insulting me, I think everything's been sufficiently cleared up Nothing's been cleared up, understand? Nothing Your white knight, that stupid gigolo won't admit you were his lover, but for me it's quite clear! You have no right to treat me this way! That's how you treat a slut, because that's what you are Aside from Harry Stephen and Carlos Mandel how many lovers have you had? I'm leaving tomorrow, I'm fed up and won't take anymore - Consider our marriage over - You can do what you like, I'm tired of this poverty, of never having a cent What did you expect? I'm young and have a right to live Laura, please 1 only tried to help you out of your misery, where do you think the money has come from these last few years? Agreed 1 would've liked to have spoken to all of you at once, but Mr. Harry Stephen isn't in his room or in the rest of the house, they're looking for him in the garden What I wanted to tell you... is that Mrs. Parolli has been murdered Perhaps the game has gone too far All I can do is regret it and feel guilty about what's happened It's too late for regrets. This indicates you were right, that among us... - there is a killer - Have you notified the police? Impossible, the killer has destroyed the telephones, we're cut off But we have cars. Any one of us could go call them, - it would only take three hours - The killer's also thought of that, all the breaks have been cut, Hernez is trying to fix them with all haste They've found Harry, he has a hatchet in his head Francis, see to your cousin Thank you, I feel better now, but it's horrible, horrible What's horrible? It's useless to wait for Harry, he's not coming anymore They've just found his body in the cellar, he's been murdered in a horrifying way How horrible Laura, I forbid you to weep over that cad's death - Mr. Gibbs! - This complicates things, there are several people for whom Stephen's death could have some significance For example, for Mr. Fon His wife was in the cellar with Stephen late yesterday, I saw them from my window, - I regret to say - 1 won't tolerate such an insinuation! My wife and I didn't separate all night - If you say so - Please Arlen, let's not stir things up, we have enough on our plate Don't you think this is a very dangerous game Mrs. Mandel? The guilty party feels cornered, he could kill again at any time It wouldn't be strange if you were the next victim You're right, but that's a risk I've been willing to take from the start For the the most important thing is to uncover my husband's killer The important thing now dear, is to find out what Cecila and Harry knew, what forced the criminal to act. If we learn that, the case will have been solved But Mother, we can't stay here waiting for that killer to get us Shut up you My proposal is that everyone go to their rooms and close the doors, especially those by themselves. Tomorrow the police will be here and all of us, save one, will be safe Have you gone mad? I told you not to come, it's too dangerous I needed to see you Don't worry, no one saw me The maids are already in bed 10,000 pounds, enough to get a lover out of trouble But which of the two? Of course it's Laura But they were tightening the screws on Cecila as well No, it doesn't make sense. Why would they go after that pair of idiots? Every moment it's clearer that there are two separate paths The best thing is to watch from the branches, you can't see the forest for the trees It can't be anyone but her husband. I bet Lisa has the information I'm missing I'd like to know your opinion on this situation 1 think it's a very dangerous matter That's not what I'm asking, 1 want to know if you have some idea who the killer is There's a lot of information, but all of it confusing. We can at least say it's a man What makes you so sure? The last crimes, their brutality seems more suited to a man, though in your husband's case it could've been a woman, it was a very feminine crime It must be someone he knew, a woman Only a woman would have volunteered to make the coffee and wash the cups It's an important detail, but perhaps the coffee was made by the killer himself, that way it'd be easy to add the sleeping pills It's possible If it's a man, that reduces the possibilities to two people Now that Harry's been killed there's no doubt Exactly, and in my opinion they both have reason to have committed the crime - Francis! - What Mother? - Let's go to sleep, it's late - Right away Mother - Turn off the light! - Yes Mother I suggest it be Mr. Martin who gives Francis the sad news I think it's a good idea Mr. Arlen It isn't exactly a pleasant duty but someone has to do it It'd be best to leave here without touching anything Can you keep this room under lock and key Mrs. Mandel? Of course Then if it pleases you lets meet everyone in the salon Agreed Let's go 1 think all of you know the news already, my aunt Bertha has been murdered This is a deathtrap, we have to leave here as soon as possible and notify the police One of the cars will be ready in an hour, I've ordered Stephen's sports car to be the first to be fixed, it's the fastest of all Do you have any idea of the killers motives for committing this new crime? It doesn't seem to fit with the earlier ones My aunt had discovered something she was going to tell me I'm not sure what it was about, but she had said she recognized someone She had a very good memory for faces She said something about that to me She spoke about the money and a theft from one of her friends She seemed indecisive, as if... as if something didn't make sense in all this Yes, she spoke of something like that - And the new clue Mrs. Mandel? - What clue? You hadn't said anything Mrs. Mandel asked us to keep the secret This time the killer has left a trail that will be hard to hide I'm afraid I haven't had enough time to fix the matter You should tell us what this is about I don't think it's time, it'd just help the killer hide himself We can't just sit here with our arms crossed We have to wait, wait for the police and give him time to pick his next victim! Calm down little one, you have nothing to fear, a little air will do you good Come I'm confused, I don't know what to do under the circumstances Personally I'd lock myself in my room and not come out until the police arrived We can't all stay together, and separating might make the killer's plans easier I agree It's possible, but I'm not disposed to continue this reunion a minute longer This is horrible, I've never felt so alone, so cornered Don't be afraid, we're together at the moment and besides, you... What? You seem to be the only one worth the while to me now, this scene disgusted me from the beginning I don't think copying famous paintings is a crime, no one wants my originals and I have to eat every day Itisn't a crime being a waitress either though everyone might think horrible things of me Would you believe me if I said I was happy about everything that's happened only because I met you? I love you, you know Do you think we'll get out of this dilemma? Now I believe it more than ever Until this is over no one can feel safe Who will be the next victim? Lisa? Francis? Or maybe you and 1? I understand your disquiet, but we can only wait I don't think either you or I have anything to fear The killer is preparing to escape, things have gone too far - We can't stay here waiting - Why? We can't do anything 1 don't know how you can just sit there entertaining yourself with that nonsense And what do you want me to do? I already told you it'd be best to leave This matter could be our ruin, I'm imagining the newspaper headlines, "Rich Industrialist Mixed Up in Triple Murder", cans of tuna stained in blood, naturally no one would want to eat that tuna Oh, well you never know, maybe it'd be magnificent advertising Don't spout nonsense By the way, you owe me an explanation -Me? -Yes, you What the hell were you doing in the cellar with Harry Stephen Oh, dear I've explained it a thousand times, it was raining and we took shelter there - Absolutely nothing happened - That's what you say Vulgar or not, jealousy is very logical when dealing with that scoundrel Don't speak about him like that now that he's dead I don't give a damn. Something happened between you You were very upset with him that night. You better not have done something stupid How can you think something like that? Well, seeing that you want to know, he tried to come on to me and logically I stopped him cold That cad! What did you expect man, I'm still good looking It was marvelous, it's like it's the first time I've really loved anyone We've been a pair of idiots, we should have known the moment we met We would have spared ourselves these hellish days - What do they matter now? - You're right And besides, I reaffirm what I said to you the other day, 1 won't leave this place until I uncover the killer Have you learned something? Not yet, but I have some very clear ideas Wouldn't it be better to forget this matter, at least for a few moments, don't you think love? Of course You know very well I didn't ask to meet you for this What happened to my aunt has left me perplexed, I need you to help me Henry, I urgently need to find out who the killer is 1 don't think it'll be long before he's caught, it's obvious he feels cornered It's exasperating, not being able to do anything and with the agony of not knowing who the next victim will be My suspicions fall on two people and I'm sure it must be one of them Either Guillermo Gibbs, or though it may seem incredible, your cousin Francis Francis is repulsive but I don't think him capable of killing his mother I don't agree She tortured him continuously and I've caught Francis many times looking like he wanted to snap her neck It'd be horrible Mother No, Mother As you want Mother! Go to hell Mother! Nonsense Henry, Francis wouldn't hurt a fly But there's something I don't understand Cecilia's death seemed to point at her mysterious and unknown ex-husband I don't understand what reason Gibbs could have to kill her 1 don't know but we'll find out You can't leave before the police get here, it'd be idiocy on your part You aren't anyone to give me advice or to ask me questions Naturally you can do what you want I repeat once more, everything's over between us Guillermo, I hope you change your mind, if you leave now you become the prime suspect What do I care? I have my reasons not to be here when the police arrive - Then... you? - Don't be stupid, it's not about that By the way, where have you left my jacket Last night it was hung up in the armoire, you haven't worn it these last few days They must've taken it. No matter, I'll leave without it - Please Guillermo, calm down - Don't try to get in my way You can't leave me here alone, - I won't allow it - Don't touch me! It's useless Is that you Guillermo? If you're here to ask about the car I can tell you it's already fixed - I'll be leaving in 15 minutes - Ah, magnificent, but first go see the lady Hey, you don't need to take the keys I have orders that no one must leave Don't be stupid and give me the keys! Henry, what's wrong? Something horrible has happened, two new murders - It's not possible - Mrs. Gibbs, they killed her savagely with a knitting needle Elena discovered the body in the bathroom, and Hernez... he's laid out in the garage, they split his head with a wrench This will be our last reunion, Though two more murders have been committed none of you have anything to fear The person we were looking for has died as well Henry is about to inform the police Two more murders, it's terrible It was Mr. Gibbs. Before escaping he killed his own wife and the chauffeur Before escaping? Didn't you say he died? He crashed the car a few kilometers from here - I always suspected him -Me too And now that everything's over I'd like to ask a favor, and the same to all of you In the past few days there's been an unveiling of, let's call it dirty laundry, and I'd like it if- I can assure you that everything that's been said here is as good as forgotten I expect that the rest of you are of the same opinion Of course I confess that in spite of everything I don't understand this story I suppose jealousy was the reason Guillermo Gibbs killed his wife so sadistically but I don't understand the deaths of Cecilia Parolli or your aunt Itisn't very clear for me either, I hope the police can give me an explanation There's a curious detail: Mr. Gibbs dedicated himself to trafficking drugs the gardener was the first to discover it and Henry found some small bags full of a white substance in his wallet, I wouldn't be surprised if it was heroin Given his position it wouldn't be hard to distribute it He must have been a small scale operator It's possible that Carlos discovered Mr. Gibbs activities and it led to his murder Now I understand why he was in such a rush to leave, he didn't want to be caught by the police while carrying the drugs Yes, it wouldn't have been easy to show he committed the murders 1 think all our lives will be very different from now on, -it's been a terrible experience - And you Francis? What do you plan to do now? 1 don't know Mother's death has disturbed me, she never let me face things, but I'll have to do something Lately our economic situation was going from bad to worse The cars are ready, Henry has done a good job 1 ask you to forgive me for everything you've gone through It's already forgotten, 1 think that seen from outside it would have been exciting but one day after another... I'll never go to another dinner with 13 people at the table I'm grateful you've stayed with me until the end, the maids have left as well, after what happened no girl would have stayed a minute longer - And you, what will you do now? - Leave Henry will take me to the city once I've closed the house up You've been very kind, in other circumstances... I understand, and I'd like to apologize again Goodbye Lisa So long Let's go inside Henry, I'm a little cold - They've finally left - And we'll do the same soon This has been like a nightmare Dear, have you thought about where we'll go? Not yet. The apartment in London has bad memories for me Perhaps a hotel in Paris for a while would be the best solution 1 think that a young widow accompanied by her caretaker would give people pause You're right, it's best we separate By the way, there's something I've hidden from you and I think you should know - A new crime? - In a manner of speaking, yes Gibbs' death wasn't accidental I was afraid the killer would escape and loosened the nut on the steering wheel - Have you told the police? - Of course not You shouldn't have done it Henry, we can't take justice into our own hands 1 did it all for you Lisa, to help you You'll never have to wear those clothes again my love Henry, it was you You're Cecilia's husband, Carlos' murderer! - 1 can explain Lisa - There's nothing to explain - I love you Lisa - Don't come closer! Everything I've done is for you, to win your love - I've waited many years! - You're a filthy killer! It was you who killed Laura 50 Guillermo would seem guilty I've been an idiot, you've only been after my money, - like with Cecilia «It's not true! Hold it! Don't try anything Henry, I have you in my sights, move to the side Even though you nearly fooled us all I can't congratulate you But seducing the lady of the house and having two suitcases full of money isn't common in a caretaker Translation: Turdis February 2010
