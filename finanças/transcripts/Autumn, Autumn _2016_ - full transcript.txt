BOMNAE Films You must have been very close to each other. Yes. We were best friends since high school. We watched each other's back. Since she moved to America about ten years ago, she visits every 2 or 3 years. - Excuse me, can you hold on to this for a minute? - Sure. - Here's just fine. - It's okay. I admire people who kept their best friends. I've been busy working and taking care of my family. I haven't been able to keep in touch with my friends. Honestly, I lost contact with all my friends. I don't get in touch with my friends that often. Since we don't live close to each other any more... - Thank you. - Not at all. We see each other every 2 or 3 years. We cry when we have to say good bye. We get really sad. I wish she lived in Korea. But what can we do. America is her new home now. She... She left in a hurry again last time. She made me want to go somewhere, too. I thought of Chun-cheon a lot. I think about then and realize how nice it was. How pretty the place was. Chun-cheon... There is something about Chun-cheon. Hey, Ji-hyeon! - Hey... - Where are you going? - I'm just coming back from Seoul. - Are you still in Chun-cheon? - Yes, how are you doing? - Great. I'm off to Seoul to work. - Right now? - Yeap. Hey, I'll call you. Okay, later! Hey, Wan. No, I took the last train back from Seoul. Did you get off work? Good job. I'm on my way to Min-jung's for a beer, but hey... They've bulldozed the whole area. Yeah. Yeap. The interview went well. Just a bunch of obvious questions. The manager was really nice. He asked me how we knew each other. I owe you big time. I don't get it. Fuck. Why does Wan... Why does he always get your hopes up? Man, get over it. It's not the last interview you'll ever get. I wouldn't be so sure. Hey, you're smarter than any of us. You were top of class in high school. Who gives a shit about that? Chun-cheon is a shithole. I heard you... ran across Jong-seong at the station. Who? Jong-seong Park. Ah, Jong-seong. Jong-seong... I couldn't remember his name. He was on his way to Seoul, to work. He is one miserable bastard. He could sing like no one can. He quit music about three years ago after his mother passed away. He had to find a job to pay off her debt. I can't believe I missed the funeral... Hey, Ji-hyun. Dude. Bro, did I tell you I'm in construction business now? I've got my hands on construction waste. I'm about to rake in some money. You wanna go somewhere nice? It's on me tonight. Come on. Hey! Where are you going? Ji-hyun. Let's go somewhere nice. Hey! Ji-hyun! Hey, you crazy son of a bitch! Hey! I don't know that yet. They said they'll get back to me next week or so. I'm going to the library. It's open on Sunday. Okay. Don't worry. I won't skip lunch. All right. - Don't put yourself down. Lighten up. - I won't. - You should hang together in times like these. - I will. - And keep up with Wan. - Next time, I'll bring Wan along. You should cling to your friends. No, not 'cling to'. It's all the same. No, it's not the same. Yes, it is. It's like a rope you cling to. That's what keeps you connected. - Nah, I don't think so. - Oh, shut up. Anyway, you should hang out with your friends more often. Yes. When the going gets tough, talk to your friends. Hang out with them often and keep your chin up. Remind yourself that your time will come. - But don't let greed get the best of you. - Understood. You'll live to see a good day. Trust me. I was in dire situation... That was a really tough time. When Wan was little, he came by for a meal to spare his mother the trouble. We were destitute. I even tried to kill myself. But once I turned the corner, it was all good - Everyone goes through a tough time. - Yes, she's right. You'll live to see a good day. You have to hang in there. You have to live life to the full. Unless you do, you'll never get there. I got it. If you think you'll never make it, you'll never make it. You should at least try. Aside from that, come and see me more frequently - The more you come, the better it gets. - Yes. - She's lying. - Can I help you with anything else? The more you come, the more you work... My goodness... Come and visit more often. At least, the kitchen is always open. Yeah, you have to make time to visit. Isn't she like a mother to you... Yes. - Put it down there. - Here? You should talk to your friends and let them cheer you up. Anyway, wherever you wind up, come and visit anytime. Yes. - Your friends won't turn their backs on you. - Come and help me out more often. Bring Wan along. It's been a while since I saw him. Come. Come over here. Hello? Hello? Who's calling? Seong-jong? Who is this? Oh, I mean... Jong-seong! Park Jong-seong! It's me Ji-hyeon. - Hey! - You said you'll call, you bastard. How did you get my number? Were you sleeping? Nah, I was awake. I'm in bed, though. I'm at Wan's mother's restaurant. - Really? - Yeah. - What are you doing there? - I'm just dropping by. - I see. Is she well? - Yeah, she's well. It's been a while since I last saw her. But you guys hung out here a lot in Uni. I've only been there a couple of times. She was really nice to us. I didn't have your number so I asked Wan. I'm glad you did, man. So how are you doing? Me? The same. We didn't catch up the other night. - Yeah, we sort of glided past each other. - Yeah. Did things work out in Seoul? Yeah, it's work. I'm working in Seoul. You must be doing all right, eh? Well... I wouldn't say that. Come on. I think you're doing pretty well. I don't know. It's a shame we couldn't catch up. It's been forever since we caught up. That night, I had a drink with Min-jung at Kidae supermarket. Yeah, I know where that is. So you guys got together. What have you been up to lately? I'm just... Well, I'm looking for a job. I heard that... That you're not doing music... About the contest? I was knocked out, man. Hey, I think you did well. You should be proud that you got that far. It was hard. I don't think I have it in me. Well... Anyway... I was talking to Min-jung and it got me thinking. I'm so sorry I couldn't be there at the funeral. No, don't worry about it. It's just been crazy. I, uh... But still... I should have gone. It happened so suddenly. We were all in a panic... Gee, it was crazy. I'm really... ashamed to say this... and sorry... Nah, you don't have to be. I... I didn't... I even forgot your name, Jong-seong. Yeah? Yeah, fuck. I saw you at the escalator, but couldn't remember shit... Hey, people forget, man. It happens. Why are you crying? What's the matter? Jong-seong, I'm so sorry... What's wrong, man? Hey, what's the matter? Come on, man. It's... It's been bothering me... Aw, Ji-hyun you pussy... Hey, we should really meet up for a drink. - Yeah? - I'd like that too. Pal, my body is screaming for some alcohol. Hey, I'll try to be a better man. Let's get together with Wan. We should come back here. That'll be nice. Very nice. Hey, by the way... Damn, I've never... I knew you could sing but I haven't heard you sing since high school. - Forget it, man. - Can you sing for me, just for once? Man, I told you. I quit music. No, no... I'm sorry. But hey... Hey, just for once. Please. Hey, are you high or something? Come on, please! Just once. I beg you. For the last time... Please, please. You'll do it? Yeah? Ready? One two, one-two... Hey, it's a slow song. Okay. Shit... I don't normally sing to a guy. - Okay, Well... It's a short one. - Okay! If the water's too deep to dip your feet And you don't dare catch the swaying waves, I'll understand Even if seeing the sun takes away my shine Even if it takes away my breath Oh~ Oh~ I'll fly up to the sky and hold you in my arms Stay in my arms when I'm cold, stay with me This world is full of temptation, I have no where to lay my feet Autumn, Autumn It has changed a lot. What? - Here, the place has changed. - Oh, yes. There used to be a U.S. military camp. I heard they built new roads on where it used to be. After all, it's been 20 years. Come to think of it, I think there used to be a big mountain over there. I'm not sure. Maybe it's the dark. - Oh, sorry about the cigarette smoke. - No, it's okay. I've been trying to quit. It's not easy. - Anyway, we should decide where to go. - I know. We should cross the road. - Let's go. - Okay. Uh... Where do I touch? - There. That's the Royal deluxe suite. - Okay. - If you touch the arrow... - Here? Oh, I got it. - Royal deluxe suite... - And there is the Suite. Which is better? The Suite. It's better. Okay, I'll take the Suite. - How much? - $170. But here it says $150. It's a busy week. The Chun-cheon Marathon is tomorrow. - Oh... - You won't get a better deal else where. So that's why it was hard to get a room. Se-rang. Wait, where's the light switch... I wonder why... they put the bath tub there. Can we stay somewhere else? It seemed like they were all fully booked. Well, I'll step outside while you take a bath. You can take all the time you need. How does that sound? Okay. I'll go outside for a cigarette. Please let me in when I knock on the door later. - I think there's a door bell. - Oh, really? - Yes. - Okay, then. Se-rang. Uh... A friend once told me that when you're having buckwheat noodles, you have to stir it as many times as your age before you eat it. Does that mean I have to stir 45 times? That's right. What if when you're 80? Do you have to stir 80 times? Yes. But you know, it makes total sense. This is made from buckwheat, so the more you stir, the softer it gets. - Wouldn't that make it easier to digest? - Yes. I see. And when you're almost done, you can ask for some cooking water to mix with the rest and finish it up. That's the best way to enjoy it. Too bad they don't do that here. It's a shame. I should have told you this in the beginning. I was here 23 years ago. I had a Bibimbap on the 2nd floor. It was the same then. The food wasn't that good. It's funny. I traveled so far only to end up having a Bibimbap. At least the view is good. Um... Earlier on, why did you get so startled? It's been about 7 years since I became so faint-hearted. My husband runs a trading company. Since he works with companies in different countries, the phone rings all the time. Day and night... Sometimes it's good news and sometimes it isn't. Once, we had our house mortgaged but things went wrong. Whenever things didn't work out, we were startled. I think that built up inside me. And made me weak. One night, I got petrified by a noise. It was only a small noise from my husband who had come home. He got so angry at me for being so rattled, he left the house. It's something I can't control. But he gets angry or leaves the house without saying a word. It happens every time. Well, I'm not better off myself. When I'm home, it's as good as being alone. The kid never steps out of the room and my wife is busy on her own terms. Last time, the water level was a lot higher. The dam looked majestic. - Now, there is barely any water. - I agree. It looks depleted. It feels a bit plaintive. Do you remember when you were in elementary school? Back then, the playground felt very big. It took me ages to run from one end of the ground to another. But when I went back, it was only a small piece of land. I think it's like that playground. It used look really deep and vast. Now it doesn't. Isn't that too perfect to be real? Yeah. Sometimes, my husband doesn't come home more than once a month. But we get by. The boy doesn't ask for his dad any more. I'm not happy but I'm not unhappy either. Se-rang, look. Do you see that? Oh my! Don't touch it. Just leave it. - Isn't this a praying mantis? - Yes. - I saw a lot of them when I was little. - It reminds me of those old kung fu movies. The praying mantis style was popular among kids. I used to hold a mantis by the tail like this and play. That's... What was it.. Grasshopper! They look alike. But grasshopper is bigger and its legs are much-thicker. If you hold it by the the legs, it would squiggle up and down. - Yes, like this. - That's why we call it the 'miller bug'. That's right. I haven't seen a mantis since childhood. Did you know that the mantis turns brown in autumn? Just like an autumn leaf. - Yeah, look at its tail... - It's brownish. Yes, it is. That's because the forest turns brown in autumn. It's changing its color to guard itself from the predators. By the way, is it true that a mantis can bite off a man's wart? Really? - That's what I heard when I was little... - Oh. Is it true? That I don't know. As a kid, I had a big wart on my skin. Sol caught a mantis to get rid of it. But it didn't work. You tried? Not quite. I was too scared that it might hurt. That reminds me. We caught dragonflies to bust that myth. After all, it was easier to catch a dragonfly. We placed it near the skin and let it bite. However, it didn't seem to work. - I guess it's sort of an urban myth. - Yeah. It was really scary. We would scream. You know what? You're smiling a lot today. It's nice to see you smile. It was... It was nice to talk and to walk around together. What did you think when you first saw me? I was scared. Why? Well, we never talked face to face. But there we were for the time.. No one has ever said that about me. Since I'm not a big person, people don't normally get scared of me. Maybe... Maybe it was just me. Were you scared that I might be one of those bad people? That trick women into seeing them and steal their money? No, my imagination didn't get that far. Even before we met face to face, I liked talking to you. So I wanted to meet you. But at the same time, I was worried. I was scared. But you were very considerate of me. I'm grateful for that. I'm sorry that I kept you waiting outside last night. Yeah, it was cold. Thank you. As for me, I was very happy when I saw you. I was glad that... you willingly decided to travel with me. I saw your picture before but it was the first time seeing each other in real life. I was happy and delighted. I'm glad to hear that. Didn't you say you had been here at Cheongpyeong Temple? Who were you traveling with? The first man lever loved. - Your first love? - Yes. That makes two of us. I guess this is the kind of a place for those in love. How long did the relationship last? For about two and half years. Um... Um.. Let me see. I think mine lasted for about a year. When we came, it was for another reason. We were going through a break up. Things were tough and we were too young. We decided to go our separate ways. It was a good-bye trip. It was winter. There were few people. It was incredibly cold. I think it snowed a lot. It felt weird in a way. Though we had decided to break up, we still wanted to travel together. To be honest, I think I had this little hope that the trip would bring us back together. A part of me was wondering if it was really the end. On our way to the temple, I tried to break the ice but it didn't work. We kept quiet and went on looking at the view. The view wasn't much to look at though. Just a lot of snow. That's how we went up the hill. On the way down, we held hands. That was funny. And then... Then it was really the end. Last time I was here, I was still madly in love. That must have been nice. We came to look at the flowers. So that's why you said spring is the best time to come. I packed lunch and dessert for the trip. It was one of the happiest moments. Everything seemed promising then. At the time, I was restless. I didn't know what to do with my life. If I marry this woman, where should we live, how would we raise the kid... I was so overwhelmed by these thoughts that I couldn't concentrate on the relationship. I was thinking "If we get married, how should we live?" "Where should we live?" "How should we make a living?" "What about kids?" "How would I raise them?". "How should I educate them?" "How should I educate them?" We weren't even married yet. After all, it was only a year-long thing. But I couldn't get these thoughts out of my head. And obviously, she could tell that I was anxious. I was constantly bringing it up the future that hadn't even happened yet. We couldn't help but get into a fight. How stupid was that. Now that you've said it, I think my boyfriend had a similar issue. But all I cared about was whether he really loved me or not. That was what made me nervous, not the future. I see. Excuse me, duty calls. It's still here. I'll get rid of it. It is warmer on this side. - Was the sun getting in your eyes? - Yes. It must have been blinding... Shall we order something else? No, this is fine. I've a sore throat. This might sound corny, but you look beautiful when you smile. - That's really corny. - Yeah, that was to make you laugh. I haven't heard anything like that in a long time. I haven't said anything like that in a long time. What is it? Come here. Se-rang! Is that the left-over? Yes, it's gone bad. Excuse me, is this your seat? Oh, we're traveling together. Do you mind switching seats with me? My seat is the one in front. Oh... But they inspect your ticket nowadays. But if you don't mind... - Sorry, but I got into trouble the last time. - All right.
