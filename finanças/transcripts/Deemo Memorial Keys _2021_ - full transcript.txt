[soft piano music] [music stops] [bright piano music] [rain falling] [classical piano music being played] [music continues] [Valensky] Well done. Sania, it's your turn. Step forward. [whispers] Sania. Are you listening? -[Valensky] Sania! -[Sania yelps] Uh... I'm so sorry. I'm going. Appreciate it. If you would. Oh, uh, yes sir. [soft bells chiming] [whimpers] [bells continue] "La Campanella." Have it prepared and be present for our next class. [sighs] Well, I totally bombed. I'm dreading our next class. [Rosalia chuckles] Seems like that transfer student really caught your eye, huh? [Sania chuckles] Was I obvious? Painfully so. I just realized I don't know her name. Guess that makes two of us. I haven't really seen her outside of those joint classes we have together. But I heard she transferred in on a personal recommendation from Professor Valensky. Of course she did. That explains why she's so good. -However... -Hm? [Rosalia] I also heard that she's not that friendly. She's usually off by herself. [rain pattering] [cat meows] [sighs] [sighs] [gasps] [soft wistful music] [music continues] [Mirai] I don't think anything like this has ever happened before. [Nutcracker] Gracious sake's, tribulation hath landed in our laps! [Mirai] What should we do? [Nutcracker] Look not to me. I've nary a clue! [Sachet] What a hopeless pair the two of you are. [Mirai] Well, what about you? Do you have any ideas? [Sachet chuckling] No, why would I? [Mirai sighs] Helpful. [Nutcracker laughing] [Nutcracker] Be thee a pot calling the kettle black? [Mirai] Can you at least try to laugh quieter? [Sachet] I agree. We shouldn't disturb her while she's sleeping. [soft uplifting music] [groaning softly] [gasps] [music continues] [wind whistling] [shutter rattling] [whimpers] [Mirai grunts] [gasping] [grunting] [music continues] [door creaking] [music continues] [door creaks] [whimpering] [music fades] [whimpering] [sighs] [gasping] [sighs] [whimpers] [plays piano note] [lights whooshing] [ethereal music] [gasps] [gasping] [Mirai] The piano made noise. [Sachet] Wait, but I thought he was the only one who could play it. [Nutcracker] Quite so, yet only I can make clacking sounds. Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack-- [Mirai] Shut it! She'll hear you! [plays piano note] [gasps] [playing piano softly] [gasps] [girl whimpering] [whimpering] [gasps] [playing soft piano music] [sighs] [lights whooshing] [whooshing] [clapping hands] [laughing] That was really fun, Deemo. [ethereal shimmering] A new sprout! When that weird thing dove down, I thought the whole world was ending! [panting] Oh wow! -[Mirai gasping] -[girl] Mr. Cat? [Mirai gasping] I didn't know you could talk, Mr. Cat. What? No, you're wrong. I'm just a stuffed animal who can't talk. No, sir, I'm just a toy. [gulps] [girl gasps] Hmm. You're just a stuffed animal? Hey, wait, Mr. Cat! Mr. Cat! Come on, Mr. Cat! Talk to me! [groans] Come on! [sighs] I know you're in there! Huh? [giggling] Mr. Cat has a funny face! [laughing] [Mirai growling] Don't laugh! [Mirai grunts] [girl gasps] Squishing my face like that ruins the shape of my head. And Mr. Cat is not my name. I have a perfectly good name, it's Mirai. So use it, okay? So Mr. Cat's actual name is Mirai? [giggles] [whimpering] [Mirai] Huh? Wait, what? What's wrong? Was it what I said? [girl crying] Hey, uh... [girl continues crying] [foot tapping] Lay off! I didn't do anything to her. I'm sorry. I can't remember my name. [Mirai yelping] Don't cry, okay? I can't stand to see a little girl crying -when I can't help! -[girl crying] [Mirai screaming] You have to stop! If you can't stop crying, then I won't be able to stop crying either! [both sobbing] That cat's a mess, isn't he? [Nutcracker laughing] Guys! [Nutcracker chattering] [playful music] Oh, would you stop laughing? [Nutcracker laughs] [Sachet chuckles] [bright music] Huh? Here. My scent will help calm your nerves. [girl sniffing] [Nutcracker yelps] I am immobilized! Assistance! [Mirai] Now who's the mess? [Nutcracker] Thou does have my thanks, Sir Mirai. [Sachet chuckles] [music continues] [music fades] [light clicks] [Sania gasps] His eyes moved! [Rosalia gasps] [Rosalia] Seriously, cut it out, will you? Gotcha. Just hurry up and keep looking. Besides, it's your fault you left it in here in the first place. Fine. Oh. [Rosalia] Did you find it? [Sania chuckles] Success. [Rosalia sighs] [Sania giggles] Isn't she the prettiest lucky charm? All right, we should probably head back to the dorm before the professor catches us. You know, I don't think it's the professor that scares you. You're scared of being in the school at night. [Sania scoffs] What? I'm not. No. [piano playing in distance] [both gasp] [soft eerie piano music] Hear that? Yeah. [Sania gulps] [soft eerie piano music playing] [Rosalia] Who do you think is playing? Beautiful. [playing gentle piano music] I knew it, it's her. But why practice so late at night? Let's ask. Wait, hang on! [door opening] [piano music stops] Good evening! [chuckles] [chuckles awkwardly] Who are you? I'm Sania. You know, from class. Uh, and my name is Rosalia. We had practice together earlier today. What do you want? [Sania and Rosalia mumble] [Sania] We were curious why you practice at night. Wait, I... What? Your name. What is it? [girl] It's Alice. [soft piano music] A-li-ce. -Almost there, my furry fellow! -Huh? What was that you just said? [Nutcracker groans] Ouchie! [Alice] Alice. -That's my name! Alice! -[bright piano music] So you remembered! What a delightful boon! It's nice to meet you, Alice. I'm Fragrant Sachet. Pleasure's all mine. [Nutcracker clears throat] Salutations. -I am Nutcracker. -Ugh, that's creepy. [Nutcracker chattering] [Mirai] Huh? It changed. -It's pretty. -Crazy. Must've grown while we weren't looking. I think you're right. What kind of tree is it? It started growing when the piano was played, so, that must make it a music tree. A music tree? Yo! Beats me, peach tree, maybe pepper tree! I guess we'll see! [sighs sadly] I suppose I have not yet grasped the concept of rap. -Too bad, so sad. -Old man, none of that was rap. How embarrassing. I missed the mark, I'm in the dark! Oh, well! The tree, will it get bigger? Seems like it. I mean, why wouldn't it? Maybe it'll grow up to the ceiling. [Alice gasps] [Mirai] One stormy night, that window opened, -and you fell through it. -[Alice] Huh? [mystical whooshing] Hmm. [Sachet] Maybe your home is on the other side of that window up there. -[Alice struggling] -[Mirai] Alice? [Alice straining] I can't reach it. Might a ladder assist thine efforts to reach the sky? A ladder's not gonna be tall enough. Sachet, what about you? You could fly up there and look. I'm light and airy, but that's too high. My scent would completely dissipate. Hey, do you think I'd be able to go home once this tree grows taller? [Mirai gasps] Then you'd be able to reach. So how can we help the tree to grow? Hmm. Well, it is a music tree. Maybe it needs to hear the piano more. [plays piano notes] [Alice gasps] Much better. Thanks, Deemo. [playing bright piano music] What a delightful melody! The tinkling of ivory black makes me want to clack! Clack clack clack! [woman singing in Japanese] It's gigantic now! [Sachet] I knew it. A music tree grows when it hears the piano being played. Great! So all we need to do is keep playing more music. Might these efforts suffice? Clack, clack, clack! Clack, clack, clack, clack-- Cut that out! It's not just about making noise. Deemo has to play music on the piano, different songs, and for that, we'll have to find more sheet music. [women singing in Japanese] That's how we'll help the tree keep growing. Makes sense. [Mirai] When it gets tall enough, Alice can reach the window. Sheet music? That stuff. The paper with the lines on it. [Alice] I can go home if I find more of these? [Mirai] Seems to have worked thus far. [Alice gasps happily] Then lets go find some! [Nutcracker] Thou hast my aid! -[Sachet] I'll help too. -[Mirai] Me too! We'll all go look! First stop is the library. -[Sachet and Nutcracker] Right. -[Nutcracker] Ly so! [bright uplifting music] [woman singing in Japanese] [playing jazzy piano music] [tree whooshing] [all gasping] [Alice gasps] [music continues] Oh, wow! It's even bigger than it was before! Quite. [Alice gasps] [music fades] [gasps] [ethereal whooshing] [jazzy piano music playing] Who was that just now? Uh? What's wrong? Did you see something? I was somewhere else and saw a man's face. I'm pretty sure he was a stranger, but... [music fades] [rain pattering] [sighing] [whimpering] [soft uneasy music] [no audible piano note] [uneasy music continues] [Alice whimpering] [thunder rumbling] [Alice gasps] [lighting crashing] [Alice gasps] [whimpering] Is anyone here? [tense eerie music] [whimpers] [light flickers] [Alice gasps] [Alice whimpering] [Alice breathing deeply] [monitor beeping] [whimpering, panting] [whimpering] [eerie music] Where'd everyone go? Deemo, are you there? [no audible piano note] [tense atmospheric music] But why? [creaking] [slamming] [distant monitor beeping] [Alice gasps] Everyone? [Alice whimpering] [eerie whooshing] [tense atmospheric music] [wood creaking] [Alice gasps] [girl] You can't come in here. [Alice gasps] [girl] Don't touch them! [eerie music] [girl] Don't touch them. I'm sorry. [whimpering] [girl] I really hate you. Leave this room and never come back. [Alice gasps] [Sachet] Look, we found so many. [Mirai] She's gonna be so happy. [Sachet] Yes, I bet Alice will be delighted. Huh? Hey, Alice! Where were you? Look, we scored big time! -Huh? -[Sachet] We hit the jackpot! Every single page of this new song. [laughing] [Alice sighs] [Sachet] What? Oh. [Nutcracker] My dear lady, Miss Alice. I also discovered a multitude of pages for our musical investigation. [straining] I met a girl wearing a mask over her face. [all gasp] [Nutcracker] Oh! [tense music] You did? Where did you see her? [Alice] Who was that? [all groan] [sighs] [Nutcracker] That would be the mistress of this house. Rarely does the madame make an appearance to the inhabitants of this manor. Is that not so, Sir Mirai? Yeah. You see, she's also collecting the music. But why? Is she also trying to find a way home? Not at all. This place is her home, but... she doesn't like the piano at all, so she's trying to make sure the sheet music stays hidden. Alice, take a good, hard look at these. [Alice sighs] Hmm? Hmm. Hmm. There's no notes on the lines. It may look blank, but it's not. Only two of us can see them. And that's Deemo and the Masked Lady. Just those two? Close inspection, rubbing sections, light reflection, none of these revealed the page's secrets! [Sachet grunts] Too heavy. [both yelp, sigh] I wonder. Maybe there's a reason why only she and Deemo can see what's written. A secret. Huh? [mystical whirring] [Alice gasps] Something's written on there! [gentle music] Wait a second, you can see it? Hmm, just barely. [Mirai gasping] [Alice] And it kind of smells like a flower. [Mirai] Flower? It's floral? Like roses? Or more like jasmine? Neither of those. The smell is more gentle. [gasps] Deemo! Deemo, where have you been hiding? [gasps] The smell is gentle. [playing bright piano music] [sighs] What a nice song. Such a joyous tune provokes thine form to unwarranted frivolous frolicking! [Alice giggles] [Nutcracker laughing] Oh, I know! I'll go get my box! Hey. Mr. Cat? [Sachet gasps] [music continues] [Alice gasping] [Alice giggles] This also has a nice gentle smell. It really does. This must be that floral scent. [both giggle] [Mirai] Hey! Now we can all join in! [music fades] Ta-da! Ba-bum! [Sachet laughs excitedly] Here, you can play something too. [Nutcracker] A festivus with the rest of us. [whimpers] Huh? What a great idea! [plays piano note] Like that? [plays soft piano music] Now what? This one? [giggles] [playing bright piano music] [Alice giggles] [exciting music] [Sachet humming] [Mirai imitates trumpet] [Nutcracker laughing] [Alice gasping] [gentle music] [tree creaking] [all gasping] Oh! [Mirai] Alice! It's getting taller! [Alice gasps] [Masked Lady panting] This is bad. I can't find it. Where is it? Where did that sheet music go? For the "Beginning Song." [music continues in distance] [sighs] I hate you, Alice. [glass cracks] [music stops] [playing gentle piano music] [Sania] Oh, Alice! Hi, hi! Hello! Hmm. [Sania] I see you're practicing! -Good for you! -What do you want, Sania? [Sania] Uh. Well, you just, you were playing that piece before. What's it called? There isn't a title. Oh. For real? Shoot, I was hoping to hear the rest of it. [Alice] I can't remember the rest. [Sania] Huh? [Alice] I'd really like to hear the rest of it, too. [playing soft piano music] I heard it somewhere a really long time ago. But I can't remember what comes next. -Hey, uh-- -[Rosalia] Sania! [Sania] Rosalia, what's up? Professor Valensky's looking for you! [Sania] I'm on my way! Oh, see ya later! [Alice humming] [Alice sighs] [Alice straining] It's a long way to the ceiling. There has to be a reason why it hasn't grown tall enough yet. Maybe over there. Yep, this looks fishy. And that, too. [Mirai gasps] [Mirai whimpering] [Alice gasps] For me? Thank you. [Mirai] Hmm. Well, I certainly wasn't expecting that. In all my days, I never imagined Madame would part with sheet music. What if she heard us playing the other day? It could be that she felt left out. [Nutcracker] It may be so. Can you play it? [playing exciting piano music] [Mirai gasping] Huh? [music intensifies] [wind whooshing] Huh? Such turbulence. This piece is the embodiment of unrest. [wind gusting] What happened? It's like a storm! I can't take much more of this! [all struggling] [Alice] Deemo! [music continues] [wind gusting] [both struggling] [Sachet yelping] [all shouting] [all shouting] [Mirai shouting] [Nutcracker yelping] [wind gusting] [lightning crashing] Deemo! [music continues] [explosion booming] [Alice screaming] [music fades] [metronome ticking] [Alice crying] The tree was growing so high! Come on, don't cry. But... [Alice sobbing] [Mirai] Please don't cry, Alice. You know seeing a little girl cry like this just breaks my heart, so let's just-- [Alice sobbing] -[soft piano music] -[Mirai] It's okay. Please stop crying. [Alice] But now I can never go back home! [Mirai] There, there. [Nutcracker sobbing] [Alice sobbing] [soft emotional music] [music continues] [Mirai sighs] The little miss finally drifted off. I'm sure she's exhausted. She cried her eyes out. Every single one of my fibers are soaked with her tiny tears. Still, I'm proud of you for being so patient with her. [Mirai] You know, a long time ago... [gentle music] I was hugged so hard, my fabric tore. I was completely covered in tears then, too. Gracious me. I think there's a reason why all of us are here together, with Alice. And Deemo. [bright piano music] [Mirai] And yeah, even her. [music continues] What do you want? It's just, I like the way things are. You understand how I feel, right? You understand that neither of us can let Alice leave. All I want is to protect this place. And stay with you forever. [grunts] Let go of me! [Masked Lady struggling] [Masked Lady sighs] I can't. I can't play it. [foreboding music] If I do... [plays piano note] [Masked Lady gasps] [glass cracking] [playing bright piano music] [music continues in distance] [groaning] Huh? Do either of you hear that? -Hear what? -[all yelp] Wait, Alice! What's the occasion? Let's go look! -Yeah! -Wait! I shall attend thee! [music continues] [Alice] So soft and gentle. [Mira] What is this stuff? And over there! [Alice gasps] [Alice giggling] [water rushing] [rumbling] [music continues] [Mirai gasps] [Mirai grunting] [bright inspiring music] [whooshing] [lights splashing] [music stops] [playing bright inspiring music] [music stops] [gasps] It's returned to its former glory! Wait, what's that? Flower buds? [Nutcracker] Of which genus could it be? Do you see that one? It's huge! -Lovely! -[Masked Lady] Hmm? When you played the piano! That was Deemo, though. Mm-mm! I could tell it was you! You could? Of course! I love your tone and the way you play! -[Mirai] This is amazing! -[both gasp] Look at this! A new entryway! Check it out! [Nutcracker] I speed to you presently, sir! [Mirai] Yeah, you better! Or I'm gonna leave you behind! [Nutcracker struggling] Oh! [Alice gasps] Slow down! Wait for me! [Alice struggling] [Alice yelps] Thank you, Deemo. Is this your first time climbing? Mm-hmm. If that's the case, then follow me. Wow, thank you! Will you tell me your name? [Masked Lady] Seria. Seria? That's my name. My name is Alice! I know. [Alice grunting] [Alice] Next, I... [Alice grunting] Wait for me! [playing bright piano music] [music fades] [Seria grunts] [Alice grunting] [Alice sighs] [Alice gasps] That door is so big! [Mirai] Alice, look! Do you think if I go through the door, I can go home? It's hard to say. [soft mystical music] [traffic humming] [indistinct chattering] [Seria gasps] What's that sound? Huh? Hmm. [Alice] I recognize that. It--it's from my home! But where? Where is it? Huh? -[both struggling] -[Mirai] Come on! [Nutcracker] It won't move an inch! Come on, come on! [Sachet] Oh! It's no use. It's not budging at all. [Sachet] Well, there's a keyhole. So there must be a key. Then we shall spend our efforts on finding it! That's a great idea, but where do we look? I've never seen a key this size in the room down below. [traffic humming] [indistinct chattering] I think I can hear where it is. [Seria] Huh? It's here! [mystical whooshing] Huh? [Alice yelps] Alice, no! [wind whooshing] [Alice whimpering] [Seria] Alice! Here! [Alice gasps] [wind whooshing] [Alice yelping] [all grunt] Ow! [groans] [Alice gasps] [soft mysterious music] [Mirai] Where are we? [Alice gasps] [shudders] It's freezing cold down here! What a magnificently tall pillar! I'm not seeing an exit anywhere. [Seria] There. [Mirai] It's a key! You think it's the key for that door? Hang on. I'll go check it out. [Sachet yelping] There's a wall of wind! I can't do it! Of course. Fret not. Our goal lies before us and only requires some brainpower. [groaning] The three of us can't tackle this. Alice, could you try? Hmm, why don't we do it together? [Seria] With me? [Alice giggles] Together, then. [tense adventurous music] [Alice gasping] [Alice whimpers] [Seria] Hurry up. Mm! [exciting adventurous music] [wind rustling] [Alice yelping] [both struggling] Is this dangerous? Definitely. Shall we stop? Uh-uh. Will they fare fairly on such a road? Of course. We have to believe they will. And we'll cheer them on. There's no other choice. [Nutcracker] Thy words ring true. [Alice] Is this the key? We'll do it together. Ready, set. [both struggling] We did it! [Alice gasping] What's that? [gears cranking] [Mirai groans] What's going on? [all gasp] [Alice shrieking] [bright piano music] [both gasping] Thanks, Seria. Thank me later. Hang on tight, okay? [gears cranking] [Alice shrieking] [Nutcracker] Still thy heart! More tribulation! [Sachet] There has to be a way to stop that thing! [Mirai] Taking out the key is what set it in motion, so-- [Alice gasps] [intense music] -[Alice shrieking] -Alice. If you want to leave this place in one piece, you do exactly as I say. 'Kay! All right, let's go. -It's time. -[Alice shrieks] Get up and jump. [music continues] [Mirai shouting] [all groaning] [Alice whimpering] Thy safety brings me peace. That's great, but where are we heading? [all gasp] [all shouting] -[all yelping] -[Nutcracker] Oh dear! Oh dear! [all shouting] [unlocking] [footsteps tapping] [birds chirping] [Sania] Like this? [Rosalia] Uh, I'm not sure if that's right. [Sania] Ugh, this is so hard. Oh. Hey, Alice! Good morning! Good morning. [Rosalia] How are you? [Alice] Here. This is my lucky charm! [Alice] You left it in the practice room. Oh, thank you! -I was looking for this! -Sania! You see, this is actually a good luck charm that used to be my grandma's, so it's really special to me. [Rosalia] Which you have a habit of losing. [Sania] Oh, come on. Wait, what's this? [Alice] Well, um, her dress was torn, so I fixed it. I used to have a charm just like that. Was that overstepping? Not at all. I'm actually super happy! Thank you, Alice! Sania! You're smothering her! Oh yeah, right. Sorry. [Alice] I'll get going. Hm? All the sheet music. [Sania] Oh, yeah. I was wondering about the next part of the song. [Rosalia] Sania was telling me your story. Maybe we can find a clue or hint in it. [Sania] I just couldn't stop myself from thinking about this music. I thought it might help if I understood the feelings behind the piece. [Rosalia] So we decided to put our heads together. [Alice sighs] [Sania] From the way you were talking about it, we figured this piece means a lot to you, Alice. [Rosalia] Naturally, we wanted to help. If we could. [Alice] Why are you being so nice to me? -What do you mean, why? -Well, why not? Well, 'cause, we're friends, aren't we? [bright piano music] [girls singing in Japanese] [no audible dialogue] [music, singing continue] [no audible dialogue] [music, singing continue] [music fades] [Alice] That's not it, either. [Sania] This is tougher than we thought. [Alice] The composer's passion, happiness, anger, sadness, and joy. [Rosalia] There are so many complexities in this song. If only we had the title to give us a clue. Something like, "Spring Melody," or... Cherry blossoms. Looks like they're starting to bloom. Cherry blossoms? Hey, should we have a picnic later? That sounds nice. [playing soft piano music] [both gasp] [stops playing] -So pretty. -Mm-hm. It was perfect. [Alice] I was walking with someone. [both gasp] Alice, did you remember something? [Alice] It was when I was a little kid. I think I walked with someone under the cherry blossoms. Someone. Someone, but who? Maybe it was a family member? My family. [Valensky] Yes. It was someone very dear to you. [Alice gasps] Professor Valensky? Professor, who is this someone who was very dear to me? Hans. Does that name ring any bells for you? [Alice] Hans. [soft emotional music] Tell me. This Hans. What happened to him? [woman singing in Japanese] [Seria] These are-- [gasps] There's stairs! [Alice grunting] Alice! [Alice panting] [music continues] [Seria] Deemo. [Alice panting] [singing continues] What a sight. Oh, thank goodness. [sighs] Ah. It was Hans. We were his! [Alice panting] [Alice gasps] Deemo! If I go up these stairs, can I go home? [emotional music swells] [singing continues] [Alice] Through the window? [Alice gasps] These thorns. [Alice gasps] [Alice gasps] Deemo! [music fades] [ethereal whooshing] Just a bit more. A few more! [Seria] The "Beginning Song." So it was here the whole time. [stalks snapping] Are you really going to play it? If you do, you'll never see Alice again. Is that really okay? [playing soft piano music] [wind rustling] Deemo's playing a new piece of music. [Nutcracker] It feels of melancholy, no, perhaps gentle is the word. It smells like a fresh start. Lovely. Go, Alice. Climb those stairs with a smile. [Alice gasping] [music continues] [Alice gasping] [music swells] [Hans] Take good care of him. [Alice] 'Kay! [Hans] What's that? [Alice] It's a fish! [Hans] Very well done. [Alice giggles] [Hans] All right, I won't be gone long. [Alice whimpers] [Hans] Don't worry, Mirai's with you. [Alice crying] [Hans] I'm home! With a gift. [Alice] Scary! -[Hans] Goodnight, Alice. -[music fades] [Alice gasps] [Alice gasping] [playing bright inspiring music] [Hans sighs happily] [Alice gasps] [stairs rumbling] [Alice yelping] Hans, no, big brother! Don't leave me alone! [music continues] [Alice gasps] [music swells] [Alice gasping] [music fades] [Hans] Alice, I have to get ready for my recital. It's coming up soon. So Professor Valensky is going to look after you until it's over. Be good, okay? [Alice] Hmm. [Hans sighs] Scared to be alone? [Alice] Mm-hmm. You won't be alone, though. Mirai will take your big bro's place. Can you do that, Mirai? [voicing Mirai] I guess I have no choice! [Hans chuckles] 'Kay? [Alice grunts] I'll be back before the cherry blossoms start falling. We'll have a picnic and see them together. [Alice] Okay, but you have to play that song for me, too. [chuckles] Of course. How could I not? I wrote that piece for you, Alice. [Hans gasps] Alice! Watch out! [thudding] [Alice gasps] Big brother, no! [emotional music swells] Alice. I hope you have a wonderful life. Farewell. [Alice gasps] Big brother! Hans, don't go! [Alice crying] [lights whirring] [Alice gasps] Big brother! [lights whirring] [monitor beeping] [oxygen whooshing] [birds chirping] [wings fluttering] [water drops] [Alice] This piece was composed by my big brother, Hans. [Valensky] Hmm. After the accident, I adopted you as my daughter. But you were so full of grief, any memory of the accident was completely erased. It wasn't just Hans' death, either. You forgot about him existing entirely. Every spring, around the time the cherry blossoms would bloom, you would play that song. The opening of the "Beginning Song," that he wrote for you. I was so scared because I was alone. But I'm not now. I have wonderful friends that I can talk to. Alice. [Alice giggles] Alice, the rest of it is up to you from here. [soft emotional music] Professor, I'm ready now. [Alice panting] -[Hans] Alice. -[Alice gasps] [music continues] [Sania] Alice! Alice! It's starting soon! Mm-hmm! [Sania] Last one there's a rotten egg! -[Alice] Wait for me! -[Rosalia] Hurry! Hurry! [all giggling] [footsteps tapping] [music continues] [music fades] [bright piano music] [woman singing in Japanese] [music, singing continue] [gentle music] [woman singing in Japanese] [gentle music]
