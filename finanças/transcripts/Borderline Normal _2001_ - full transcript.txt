I thought we were gonna find some chicks and give 'em a spray. - Look guys, I'm sorry. I thought dad was going driving me back. - Your dad's too busy banging every babe in town. - Shut up. You understand that? Shut the hell up. - Look, I don't see why we just don't let him out here. I mean, what the hell are we gonna do in Windsor anyway? (car honks) - Now listen Jeremy, do not tell dad I didn't take you all the way, all right? He'll just say I'm not being a good enough brother and shit. - Yeah, that's so gay. - Hello! I don't wanna be doing this every weekend, Jeremy. I'm not your chauffeur. You're the one that wanted to live with mom in Canada. Do not tell dad! - You want me to say hello to mom for ya? - Yeah, whachacallit, sure. Look, gotta run.

Two different cars, bus, now bike. You want me in on this one? - I have asthma. - Brand new professional track shoes. You buy these in Detroit, son, so you could sell 'em in Windsor? - No. They're for me, I'm a runner. - Well, I know you like to run back and forth across the border. Which school do you go to? - Wilfred Laurier High. - You're on the track team? - Yeah. Well, I'm trying out. - Help me out here. What else are you hiding? - Nothing! - I could strip search you. I find something, I'll make you wish you never set foot in God's country. - Search me if you want. - That won't be necessary. You can go. So what is it, Mr. Jeremy Walling, born in the USA? - [Jeremy] What's what? - [Cap] Well, most young Americans are crossing the border as much as you are, are running a scam. What's yours? - [Jeremy] I got parents on both sides. - [Cap] That's original. (gentle music) (Debbie panting) - Come on! Come on! Almost. Oh come on! (panting) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Ben, it's almost eight o'clock. Where is he? - Buddy took him home a couple of hours ago. They're probably stuck in traffic, Sunday night. - Is Buddy coming? - Yeah, I wanted him to see you. I thought that would make you happy. - Oh, right. I guess you're just too busy seeing how many times 45 goes into 22 to drive him yourself. - Was that dad? I promised I'd call when I got back in. Tell him I'm all right. - You tell him. Is Buddy here? - No. - Make it short. - Hey, dad. - Jeremy. - Thanks for the weekend. - Listen, you like the running shoes and the bike? - Yeah, yeah. They're great. - 'cause we could take 'em back if you don't. We can get something else. - No, no, I like them. They're fine. Yeah. Okay. Well, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you soon. - I'll see you Friday and you stay strong, all right? - Bye. - Yeah, bye. (gentle music) - Dad got me a bike. - Oh. Nice. (Beth screams) - Feel better? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like a whole new person. Glory be, everything seems beautiful in its own way, Mr. Dickens. Could I go back to study hall or lunch early to reflect? - Oh, no. You had a breakthrough, Beth. I asked you to imagine your father starring in your dream. You screamed, that was good. Now, tell the group what you were thinking. - Nothing. I'm on a diet. I was trying to burn calories. - [Mr. Dickens] Oh, Beth. - [Beth] No, it is not funny. My dad split because my mom's butt got bigger than his. It is the biggest cause of divorce. - [Mr. Dickens] I think it's usually a little more complicated than that. Horace. - [Horace] Well, I was supposed to go with my mom down to Florida this weekend, but my dad wants me to spend some quality time with Karen's daughters. - Oh, excuse me, are you joining us? - Yeah, I guess so. I'm Jeremy Walling. - Oh, of course. Wow! Don't be shy. Pull up a pew. Now, Jeremy's just transferred to Laurier. How long have you been here, Jeremy? - Since Thanksgiving. American Thanksgiving. End of November. - Well, that's good. Well, I'm Mr. Dickens, and we'll just go round and introduce ourselves. - Co-host, Cathy Lee. - Guylain? - Guylain. - Oh, I'm Quinn. - Horace, with a C. - Hey. - Mikey. - And this is our little sleeping beauty, and her name is... - What? Oh, my name's Rachel with an R. - And as I said, I'm Mr. Dickens, and I have a master's degree in family counseling. And this is our chat group. This is a place where you can just let it all hang out. All the students here have the exact same problems as you do. So Jeremy, are your parents actually divorced? - Almost. Can I just sort of watch for awhile? - Oh no, absolutely. Right, group. What's the first thing that we learn here? - [All] We are not alone. - [Mr. Dickens] Once more with gusto. - [All] We are not alone. - And for the sake of my government grant. - Well, let's hear someone else speak. Guylain, did you see your father this weekend? (Guylain whimpers) Oh. Oh, not again. Oh, that's right. Let it all out. Let it all out. He's a bad man. He's a bad man. Say it after me. He's a bad man. - He's a bad man. - Yes. He's a bad man. - He's a bad man. - Hey, Gap guy. You're American? - Yeah, that's right. I spell color without U and I get a B for it. I never got a B in my life. - Wow! Color me impressed. - Look, sorry. I'm just pissed. Mad or whatever. - Hey, it's okay to say pissed in Canada, hey. After hockey, getting loaded is like our national pastime. My name is Beth. Rhymes with Beth. - Sweet. - You're Jeremy. I heard. So, a lot of people think that Americans are pushy, obnoxious cretins who come to Canada to rape and pillage. - Well, what do you think? - I'm into rape and pillage. (laughs) Actually, I'm an ancient history buff freak. As you can tell from the happy hour, some people think the glass is half empty. some people think it's half full. With me, there's no glass. - What's the happy hour? - Mr. Dickens' rap session for damaged goods. CoDs. Children of divorce. - So, why do you go if you hate it so much? - It's only Mondays and Fridays. You get credit, and sometimes the stories from the other losers in the group help so that I forget to eat lunch. So why'd your parents split? - What do you think? - Unselfish mom, tired of being Holly home maker decides to let her true soul gush forth. Take a younger, richer lover, male or female. Close? - Not really. It's more like your wide butt theory. - Men can be pus. Hey, your dad's probably thrilled that you're not home so he can screw his brains out in piece. - No, actually. He wants me to live with him in Detroit. - Aren't you lucky? (bell ringing) (gentle music) - Got any gun, man? - What, a gun? Me? - Not gun, gum. Like a chewing. - Oh! Well, these are asthma time capsules. Forget it. - I understand, man. I get hay fever too, don't you know? I'm Kellog. - Jeremy. Nice to meet you. - Next! Name and event, please. - Jeremy Walling, 400 meter. That's W-A-L- - L-L-I-N-G. Born in the USA, has asthma. I remember. - No way. You work at customs. You can't be coach. - Well, we're even then. Because you have $150 track shoes and can't run the 400. - Why not? - Because it's too damn difficult. It's one continuous sprint. You need muscles, power and better lungs than you got, son. - No, no, I can do it. I have in the States. - Try a cross country, all right. - What about my sweatshirt? When do I get one? - Not till you make the team. Move on. Next. (both panting) Oh, Jesus. No, no. Don't stop it. Let him get a visit from uncle Charlie tonight. That'll teach him. - No, don't file that until we see what Ben is up to. I don't wanna rush the sale of the house until I know I've got half of the business and primary custody of Jeremy. What? Florida for spring break? No way, Kevin. I don't need any of mom and dad's negativity. I just visited them in September and I still had a husband then. Kevin, be a good brother. Just be my lawyer. Thanks. Love you too. Sweetie, I've got a surprise for you. - I'm busy, mom. - Oh, come on. I got you ice cream. The kind you like. Double strawberry. - Is it Ben & Jerry's? 'cause I love Ben & Jerry's. - Can you please stop saying the name Ben? Stop saying the name Ben. Get the bowls. (Jeremy groans) Oh my God. What happened to you? - It's all right. Ow, ow, ow, ow. - What is it? Did you hurt yourself? - It's just a Charlie horse. I think I overdid it at practice. It's all right. - I do not need this stress in my life. The solution is simple, no track. - It's gonna be all right in the morning, mom. Don't worry about it. - Excuse me. If you don't get all As, it's my fault. If you don't get into a good college with a Canadian diploma, he'll blame it on me. He'll tell the court I'm limiting your future. - He will not. - Oh, stop defending him. He just wants you to go live with him and Buddy, like a bunch of guys in a damn beer ad. And he'll tell you how special his first wife was. How the hell am I supposed to follow that act? She died in childbirth. Gimme a break. - Just have some faith, all right? - See? He's poisoned Buddy against me. Buddy never visits, never returns my phone calls, doesn't care if I'm alive. He may not be my natural son, but I've raised him like one, goddammit! Your father cheated me out of everything I've built for 17 years. But he's not gonna get you, baby. - I'm staying with track, mom. - Fine. That's just what he wants. - What about my Ben & Jerry's? (gentle music) My mom's just going through a hard time. She thinks everyone's against her, and I'm not, but it just keeps getting harder. - In what way? - Well, I wish she just would forgive my dad. - What did he do? - Stab in the dark here. He cheated on her, huh? He broke a sacred oath for a cheap hump with a size two stranger. - Let him speak, Beth. This is very difficult for Jeremy. - No, not really. My dad explained it to me and I've thought about it a lot. They just grew apart. The love just stopped. - There's no such thing as love. There is mutual self-interest. And when he lost interest, he cheated on her. - Beth, shh. - It's okay. She's right. My mom caught him with one of her friends. - Women can be pus. - Beth, zip it. - At least it wasn't a cousin. - Perhaps she cheated on him. - No, no, no. She wouldn't do that. She's loyal. - Do you think that your parents' relationship was working? - Yeah. Yeah. I mean up until a few months ago, and then my brother just came to me and said it was over. - Did he beat you when he found out? - No. - Did he start doing drugs? Specifically, meth? - No. He doesn't even drink. They're both great. - But when your mother packed up and took you to Windsor, you wanted to stay with your father, correct? - Yeah. Yeah, I guess. (bell rings) - Well, that's all very interesting stuff. Listen, I hope you all have a fabulous weekend. And remember, nothing cures the blues like a good hug. Are you waiting for me, Beth? - Not likely. (both laugh) - Have a great weekend. - Hey. If your dad's so great, why don't you go live with the hard-on? - Well, dad's got Buddy. Mom doesn't have anybody. - Well, so in other words, you care. - Yeah, of course I care. She's my mother. - Well, are you helping her? What's the money situation like? - It's bad. She wants more than he's offering. - That's new. I got my mother another 200 bucks a month by threatening to tell daddy's bimbos he had crabs. - That's pretty disgusting. (both chuckle) - No, it's not. What's disgusting is he had the money the whole time.

Does that coach turn into a pumpkin at midnight? Just tell your mother that you're sleeping over at your girlfriend's house tonight. - Ben. - No, it's ridiculous. You're 23 years old. You deserve your own life. What are you doing here? - Well... - Did you meet Sandy? Sandy, this is Jeremy. Jeremy, Sandy. Jeremy's my other son. Sandy, would you wait outside for a minute? Would you? - What? - Outside? Okay. Just go down the hall, make a right. It's in the garage. She's great. Didn't your mother tell you to come over here tomorrow morning? - I never went home. I came right from practice. I ran all the way from the bus terminal. Hey, what do you think? I made the team. - Hey, that's great. That's terrific. I'm proud of you. Good. - So, where are you going, dad? - Printer's union ball. I gotta make an appearance. You know, management. I'm already late. I just, your mother... I can't believe she didn't tell you that... She couldn't just call the school up. Say, "Hello. My son..." - Well, just forget it. I mean, I can go back. - No, of course not. What are you talkin'... Make yourself at... Make yourself at home. This is your home. It's still your home. Here, take off your pack. We got a pizza going in the oven. You can watch the satellite. I told Buddy that Rocco and Hayes can stay here. So three of you, or the four of you. You hang out, you have some fun and rock and roll. Hey, rip up the joint. I don't care. Take your coat off. It looks good. (car honks) She's really great. You'll see, when we're the three of us all. Four, you know? I'm not gonna be late. - See ya. (upbeat music) - You know I am the man.

That is so ghetto, Jeremy. - Yeah, so faggy. - Not as faggy as three guys working out together in their underwear. - Does that excite you? Huh? You like that? - Shut up. - Well, there's only one way to find out, guys. Pants him. - Hey, guys, chill, chill. Forget him. Cool down, doofus. They're just horsing around. - Jesus, what did you do that for? - Buddy, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to. - Oh, you're dead. You stupid bastard! You're not even supposed to be here. Stupid bastard. - Get off of him, man. He's your brother. - Half brother! Half brother! (Jeremy wheezing) - [Hayes] Oh my God. He's having an attack. Get his inhaler.

(somber music) Hi there, you got any Cubans? - [Man] Yeah, very good, sir. - What is that? - Well, it's like Canadian M&Ms. It's just as good. - Put it down. Come here. Look, Jeremy, I don't want you getting too involved here. Well, you may be moving back real soon. I'm pushing for an earlier court date. Maybe next month. You could be back at John Glenn before, I don't know, spring break. - Really? - Yeah. Which is why I don't want you getting too wrapped up with this whole Canadian team. I think it might be better if you drop out now. - Dad, I thought you'd be proud of me. - I am. I just don't want you making any emotional commitments when ultimately you're gonna be moving back in with Buddy and me. - I know, I know. God, you're being bounced back and forth like a ping pong ball, I'm sorry. But that's all the more reason to stay focused. I mean, look at this. Look, what... This is not M&Ms. This is an Astro. And what is this? Mr. Big? It's like a knockoff of a Baby Ruth. Even Canadian football, it's all so fake. It's like a bunch of wannabes. Jeremy, you are the real deal. You are first rate. All of this, it's second rate. It's like a cheap imitation of what we are, of what you are. - Anyway, at least you can buy Cubans here. - Yeah, but have you taken a look at the fruitcake who's selling them? (both chuckle) - You know, I don't know why you hate Canada so much, dad. - Jeremy, I was married here. (gentle music) - Where's Walling? - No, thanks. So I guess you're off your diet. - Yeah, it's my mother's fault. She found out there are men who like fat women. They're called chubby chasers. (laughs) - Beth, you're not fat. - Well, not yet. And not that it matters. Have you heard the sad statistics on CoD success stories? Three out of four of us will be dysfunctional throughout our adult lives, at best, borderline normal. - Great. (Mr. Dickens whistling) - Hello, everybody. I had a pretty good weekend. I hope you all did. Who's gonna start today? Guylain. - My father, he was arrested. (all applauding) - But when the needles all came home, that's when I bail. Split, right there and there. - That was really clever of you to say no, Quinn. Let's have a round of applause for Quinn. (all applauding) Jeremy, how was your weekend? - Well, my father informed me that I'll be transferring back to my old school. He's gonna get primary custody. So I guess I'm not gonna be here very much longer. - Get your head out of your ass, Jeremy. What judge is gonna give you over to a dad who cheats with his mom's friend? He'll be lucky to get weekend visitation. Unless of course he can prove that your mother is unfit. Namely, is an alcoholic, a drug addict or sleeps with total strangers. And for that, he would have to hire a private investigator and produce evidence. - I don't think he would do that. - Yeah, that's what I thought about my daddy dearest until this hard ass PI on the witness stand started showing pictures of my mom trolling singles bars in a miniskirt. Luckily, my mother had also hired a private eye and got my dad in a hot tub with an underage hooker. He didn't even get every weekend. (bell ringing) - Well, that was very, very positive today. Yep. I shall see you all on Friday. - Listen hey, sorry that I attacked you there. Just, I don't wanna see you go, you know? - Yeah, I know. I better go. I'll see you later, all right? - Okay. - You wanted to see me? - Yeah. Come on, have a seat. Guys, do you wanna give us a moment here, please? Thank you. You missed practice without an excuse. You wanna be a part of this team? - I don't have a choice here, Cap. You know, I might be moving back to Detroit. I'd have to quit midway. - Yeah, but you're bailing anyway, aren't you? Yeah. You know, when you told me you were a 400 meters sprinter, I laughed. But then I got watching you. I saw that crazy look in your eyes. And I said to myself, here's this mixed up, talented kid who understands obstacles, been battling his whole life. Maybe I can help him become a champion. - I'm not in control here. My parents are fighting over me. What do you want me to do about it? - I want you to be a winner. Give them something to fight about. (gentle music) No, no, come on, back. Stay down through your first couple of strides. Get your hands up quick. It'll bring you up. Good balance. - Hands up quick? - Yeah, have good grade. Pick it up a little bit more. And... That's it. You got it. Get off the track. - You invite a man to come over and eat promptly at six, and he shows up almost an hour late. It's insulting. I wanted to meet him. (doorbell dings) - It's Jeremy. Come on in. Hi. I'll take your coat. Okay. That's it. - Jeremy, I've heard all about you. - Hi. I hope I'm not late. - No, no. Unfortunately, my mother was just leaving. - Yes. I have a law class at the college. - My mother's taking a computer course there. - [Mom] Oh, good for her. Sorry to hear your parents are getting a divorce. - Yeah. Well, you know? - Listen, if she wants to call me, tell her I man a divorce hotline, I know all the tricks for the trial. You can never be too prepared. - Or too thin. (mom chuckles) - Bye. - Bye. Oh, I'm sorry. I screwed up. I thought you wanted me here at 6:45. - I did. (gentle music) - Never saw you as a gourmet cook. - [Beth] Well, you know... - Or is that a recipe of the Visigoths or the ancient Romans or something? - [Beth] Actually pasta was invented by this barbarian chief named Boy-R-Dee.

(Beth humming) - [Beth] You dance real nice. - Thanks. You too. Are you as hot as I am? - Yeah. - What do you think, Bud? - [Beth] You guys. Wait. You guys. Stop it, you guys! Stop it! - Hey, where's the bathroom? Beth! Beth! - [Beth] Stop it, you guys! Stop it! - Guys, Jeremy's coming. Let's go. - Hey. (Buddy howling) - Yeah! Get in the car. Come on. - Beth, I have to know. - Well, they didn't rape me, all right? They couldn't even do that correctly. - Oh, what did they do? - Rocco, he wouldn't let go of me, and he just kept feeling me up. And then Buddy... - Buddy? What did Buddy do? Did he touch you? - No. No. No, when I was down, he got over me and he masturbated on me. (sobs) And he came all over... - They can't get away with this. We gotta tell someone. - Who, Jeremy? My mother? You wanna rip my life apart? Or do you mean the police? 'cause it's your family that has messed up. You think your father's gonna want you then? It was my fault. I was mad at you. I have a thing for barbarians. (Beth sobs) I hate being in the States. (bell rings) - I don't understand what the hell was going on out there. It was like you were running through dung. Keep your legs up. Set your head. It's like you haven't learned a damn thing. - I just wasn't concentrating, all right? - It's mental toughness. You don't get to just run when you're feeling perky. You have to hit the job today, every day. You have to run through the pain. - Sometimes, I can't. - Well, maybe you should just pack it in now. Save me the tears. (somber music) - Don't worry, man. It's gonna be okay. Hey man, don't cut me off. Everybody's got troubles. - Jeremy. How's Beth? - I don't know. She never showed up to school today. - Oh, man. Rocco really messed her up... (Jeremy grunts) Get off of me. I'm sorry. Listen to me. Listen to me. Do you understand, if she reports, do you understand what they'll do to me? Do you understand? Do you understand? - [Cap] What the hell is going on here? - What you did... - Stop it! Who is this guy? - Jeremy's brother. Just fooling around, coach. - Superstar from south of the border. I heard about you at the Can-Am meeting. What's your best time in the 400? - Best? - Yeah. - 49.7 at the Detroit Herald games. - 49.7. You couldn't even break a minute today. We'll see you at the Can-Am meeting. Now, you get out of here. Go.

Sure. - Thanks. Hey. Hey, come here. Yeah. Does your mother know that we're having dinner together? - Yeah. Yeah. I left a note. It's no big deal. - Good. - So is there something wrong or... - No. No. I just wanted to see you. Hey, how are things going at school? - It's hard actually. Canadians give more homework. - I'll bet they do, ey? (laughs) - Let's see, every time I'm here, I eat the ribs. I go home, I feel sick from the ribs. I hear you had some problems at the concert. Buddy said that Rocco was being a real jerk. - Yeah, dad. It was real bad. - Oh, that's a shame. Buddy should learn to choose his friends a little better, huh? - What? - So, you know what you want? - But dad, don't you even wanna know what happened? - Yeah. Could you give us a second? Thanks. Buddy did nothing. He swears to me that he never even touched her. - Dad, he jerked off on her. - Yo, yo, yo, sh! Come on. Jeremy. My God. I'm doing everything I can to keep this family together. What the hell is happening to us? Look, I'm not saying for sure. I mean, I don't know, but maybe from what I hear about this girl, maybe what happened, what took place there was a little more mutual than what you think. - No, no, no, dad. That's ridiculous. - I don't know. Do you? - Yeah. - Just maybe. - No. - I'll tell you what, I had my attorney speak to the judge. I want to try to get you for spring break. The judge said he had no problem with it. Why don't you and me go to Bermuda? We should spend some time together. - What? Bermuda? - Yeah, just you and me. Come on, you remember Danger Cay, swimming with the fish? - Yeah, of course I remember, but... - It'll be great. Just you and me, we get away from all of this bullshit. Let things work themselves out, huh? Speak of swimming with the fish. Well, what are you gonna have? - I don't even know- - Have the ribs. Ribs. We'll all have the ribs. - Ribs, okay. - Ribs. It's a rib place. Have ribs. Speaking of ribs, did you see that rack of ribs? (laughs) I'm sorry. I'm me. What are you gonna do? If you can't beat 'em, swim with 'em. Hey, whatever happens, this will all blow over. Everything will work out. - I hope so. - I know so. - Great choice, Jer. You know what? Go to Bermuda. Go to Bermuda, and you know what? While you're there, why don't you get a tan. Get one for your mother. - I hope you and your dad have a great time in Bermuda. It's gonna be a barrel of fun. (indistinct chattering) - Take me to Bermuda. (indistinct chattering) - Quiet! Let him speak. - She's not hurt. She didn't freak out when I explained it to her, not at all. She said that she understood and that I should go. - Because she has bigger fish to fry. She wants half his business. It's negotiation. - Why can't he just give her more money? - Because you see, Jeremy's not really worth it. - Look Beth, just because your dad does not even try to see you anymore, does not mean you have to rag out on mine. - Oh please, Jeremy, face it. Daddy loves Buddy more. - Hey, man. Firstborn always gets the biggest fatty, man. - All right. All right. Then why does he wanna go away with just me? Just me and him. - To antagonize your mother. - He knows it's her birthday, genius. You just better hope she doesn't put her head in an oven and turn on the gas. (Guylain cries) - Look, I am going to Bermuda. I'm going to Bermuda. - Look, I did not make the schedule, and I would like the throttle the joker who did. Opening up against the Can-Am meet is like going against Goliath with a paper rock, 'cause that's all we are. A team on paper, green and untested. So I've decided to use a little Canadian ingenuity. I've created a practice meet. We're gonna compete against Eaton Ridge Academy in Leamington. You know that town with a statue of the giant tomato? Well, we're gonna stomp it. Unfortunately, the only day we could decide upon was the last Saturday of your spring break. I'm sorry. I know that's short notice. But if we're gonna have any chance against those superstars across the border, we're gonna need 100% attendance. Was anyone planning on going away for the holidays? - It figures. The Yank. You're going somewhere with daddy? Palm Springs, Palm Beach? - Bermuda, actually. - Bermuda? - Yeah. Maybe I won't. - Excuse me. I didn't hear you. - I said maybe I won't go. - Personal sacrifice. All right. (all applauding) Son, you may be more Canadian than you think. - Dad, no, no. It was my decision. Mom had nothing to do with this. Dad, I had no choice. The whole team's going. I mean, I had to. Well, I don't know. Can you just take Buddy or something? - Buddy can't go. He's gonna take his SATs again. I hope a lot better this time, or he's gonna end up in some stinking junior college. Oh, come on... Jeremy, you gotta go with me. If you don't, who am I gonna take? I can't believe you're not gonna go. Oh, it's fine. I'll just have to cancel. - Dad, I'm sorry. I'll call you back, okay? - [Ben] Bye. - He was really upset. - Oh. - Look, stop grinning. What, do you get pleasure out of this? - Hey, give me a break. I am not even borderline normal. - Well, you know what? You said it, I didn't. You know something, Beth? You're not happy unless everyone around you is as screwed up as you are. - What? - Yeah, and another thing. I figured out why no one likes you. Because the minute someone does, you just stomp all over them. People have feelings too. - Yeah, people also have assholes and that's how you're acting. - You know what? Forget it. It's over. I don't wanna see you anymore. - Jeremy. (gentle music) What do you mean you don't wanna see me anymore? You think I'm gonna be invisible?

Get me a drink. Did I tell you how I used to be an actress at Michigan State? - Yes. - Well, there's a lot of things you don't know, Jeremy. Good things. That's what I want. Good things. Yeah. What do you want? - Right now, sleep. I've gotta be at my best. We go to Leamington in the morning. - Well, you go to bed then. 'cause I'm coming to watch you tomorrow. Come here and give your mother a good night hug. Come on, Jeremy. Come here. Come on. (gentle music) Oh, thank you. Thank you so much for a wonderful birthday. (phone ringing) - Mom? Hello. - [Beth] Jeremy, you're a bastard. - What? - You sat across from me for two hours tonight without saying a word, and you made me feel like a total piece of shit. And you talk about feelings? Are you gonna talk to me or not? Don't you care at all? - Wait, wait, wait, Beth. What time is it? - [Beth] It's not even midnight. Jeremy. Jeremy. - Just hold on a sec, okay? - [Beth] Answer me, Jeremy. - Mom? - [Beth] Jeremy, don't do this to me. Jeremy, talk to me. - Mom? - [Beth] Are you gonna talk to me? Jeremy. - Mom, are you in there? - [Beth] Jeremy, get on the phone. Okay, fine. - Mom? - Fine, I'm hanging up. I'm hanging up. Goodbye. Goodbye. (dial tone beeps) (dramatic music) - Come on! Come on! Come on! Mom! Mom! (siren wailing) - Jeremy. - Hey. - Hey. - If you hadn't called, she'd be dead. - Score one for the CoDs. Warning, my mother's right behind. She wouldn't let me come without her. - Jeremy, I'm just sick. Is Debbie okay? - She's in intensive care, but she's stabilized. - Was it intentional? - What? - Honey, did she leave a note? - Mom, maybe Jeremy doesn't wanna get into this right now. - It was an accident. It was a combination of the tranquilizers and the wine. She must've slipped getting in the tub. - I'd think up a good story about what happened before your father finds out. - Okay. That's enough. If you wanna stay, fine. Go chat up a widow doctor or something, but leave Jeremy alone, okay? How you doin'? - I'm okay. I keep thinking, if I'd gone to Bermuda, would this have happened? - Come on. You didn't just stay for her. You had the track meet as well. - Oh God, the track meet. I forgot all about it. Look, there's our doctor. They're gonna let me see her. So, I'm gonna go. - Okay. Yeah. So, I can stay if you want. - You don't have to. - I feel so stupid. - It's all right. (Debbie sobs) It's all right. (gentle music) (ominous music) Hello. Hello. - Boo! - Hey. - Hi. I was hoping you'd get home soon. Dinner is getting cold. - How'd you get in here? - The building manager was pretty freaked out about everything, so he let me into clean. - There was a lot of blood. I mean, you didn't have to. - Hey, I figure, if the Trojan women could handle it, so could I. Besides, I figure at a certain level, it's all sense memory. You know, something I can use. - For what? - I want to be a writer. Big historical novels, sex, blood, high cholesterol food cooked under the saddle of rampaging hordes. - Sounds awesome. - So far, I just keep a daily diary but you know, at least I talk a good game. So listen, go downstairs and start, and I will just wash up and be down in two seconds. Oh, your dad called and your coach, messages on the machine. - Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to get in touch with coach. - Yeah. - Does your mom know you're here? - I left her a note. I'll deal with her later. I am having way too much fun playing house. - Where'd you get all this stuff? - I went shopping, and then I did your laundry. I think I'm already a better wife material than my mother ever was. - Would you ever get married? Knowing what you know, even if you really love the person. - Silly boy, there's no such thing as love. It's just different levels of feels good. But I wish that we were married right now. - Yeah. Parents would love that. We'd have to run away or something. - Hey, well, you know, we'd only have to hide out until we're 18 and then there's nothing anybody can say about it. - Hey. I'm sorry.

He had to pick up his mom and then he'll be here because he wouldn't miss our happy hour. - No, he's not. Quinn, was your father released from rehab? - No, he's coming. - He's not. - I'm sorry, did you sleep with him last night too? - Actually, the social services took Jeremy.

They're getting a bigger house. - That's right. Throw your things around. That's very constructive. Look, I said you could race for the Canadian team. What more do you want from me? - Dad, I don't wanna be here. - Jeremy, you're upset. I'm sorry, I should've gotten you myself. I didn't realize they're gonna yank you right out of school like that. I thought this is what you wanted. - No, it's not what I want, dad. I wanna be back at my school. I wanna be with my girlfriend. - Girlfriend? Jeremy, look what women do to us. Haven't you learned anything? Don't be stupid. I'm sorry. I wish there was something more I could do to prove that to you. Just don't give up on me, huh? (gentle music) I'm sorry. (phone ringing) - [Beth] Jeremy. - Hey, how did you know it was me? - Had no friends, remember? - Come on. I miss you, don't spoil it. - How's it going? - Better than I thought. I had a good conversation with my dad. And I'm still running for Laurier tomorrow. Are you coming? - Yeah, I'll be there. - Great. - Jeremy. - Yeah. - Nevermind. - What is it? Are you mad at me or something? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm just mad that we're not sleeping in your mom's bed. - I love you. (Beth sniffles) Bye. (cars honking) - [Announcer] Athletes and coaches must report in to the scorekeepers bench on arrival. Please have your registration forms ready. - What's the matter, dad? - Well, Buddy got his SAT scores yesterday. He needed a combined 1000 to qualify for Michigan South. He totally tanks it with a 970, comes up 30 points short. - Well, it's no big deal. He can take it again. - No, it is a big deal. He can't take it again. The only chance he has is South Kansas. The coach from South, he said, if Buddy can win a couple of events, he can probably get him in, but now Rocco's got the flu, and Buddy feels like he's coming down with it. - Dad, I run and I have asthma. - I know, I know, but this is Buddy's big shot. Look, see what you can do to help him out, all right? Be a good brother. - Have you seen my black and white sweater. - Why? - Because I wanna wear it. - Where are you going? - There's a track meet at the sports complex. - Oh, so you wanna get assaulted again? - What? - That's where those boys are gonna be today, isn't it? I know all about it. You shouldn't have left your diary out in the open. Those boys are gonna pay for everything they did. - Well, I am not going to the police. Oh my God! You already did. God, damn you! - You're not going anywhere. Look, I'm your mother, sweetie. You're not gonna go anywhere. - You're not anymore. Just let go of me. (indistinct shouting) - [Announcer] Up next in the long jump, his third and final attempt. Benjamin Walling Jr., John Glenn High. - Come on, Buddy. Come on, Buddy. Do it, baby. Leap. Go, go, go, go, go, go. That was good. That was good. Come on, call it. Call it. - Length of jump, 6.84 meters. - 6.8? 6.8! (crowd applauding) - Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Relax, he's doing great. - What'd you write? Good? Good, that was great. - [Announcer] 6.84 meters, that's the winning number. - Today is my day, bro. - [Announcer] Benjamin Walling Jr., John Glenn High. Second place, Michael Rawlins Windsor Central. (crowd applauding) - Buddy! - [Announcer] The next round of the high jump will be at a height of 1.9 meters. And for our American friends, that translates to six feet and three inches. - This is Kellog. - [Announcer] Our first competitor, Kellog Clifford. Wilfred Laurier High. - Come on, Kellog. (crowd applauding) - [Announcer] Clifford clears the jump. - Great jump. Very good kid. - [Announcer] Next competitor, Benjamin Walling Jr., John Glenn High. - Hey, Buddy. - Let's go, Buddy. Come on, Buddy. All right, come on, Buddy. - [Announcer] Oh, looks like Walling fails to move on. - You'll get the next one, bud. - I just got eliminated, doofus. - He's mad at himself. He knows he's not his best. He's got a cold or flu or something coming on. He'll just have to take the 400. - Hey look, if he does need us and he can always start at junior college, Ben. There's no shame. - Sal, have you ever seen a faster, big guy? This guy's a champion. He's the best. He's like a race horse. You watch. - I gotta tell you, I like the way your younger boy runs. - Jeremy. - [Announcer] Spectators and athletes are reminded that food items are allowed in the stands only. - What? What did you say? - Your younger son. Cap Pierce tells me he's a real comer. - Just come. - He's gettin' there. - Beth. Hey. Hey, I'm up next. - I'm leaving. - What? Wait, you gotta watch me run. I qualified for the finals. I'm running against Buddy. (gentle music) - My mother read my diary. She reported your brother and Rocco. - Oh my God. - Do you know what this is gonna be like for me? Come with me. - The race. You gotta watch me. - I'm doomed. - Jeremy, your event's up. - Make a choice. It's disappearing time. - But Beth, you can't leave. - Don't tell me what I can't do. - Son, what's it gonna be? Make up your mind. - Beth. - [Announcer] Will the finalists for the 400, please report to their starting marks? Finalists for the 400, to your marks please. - Kellog. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please... - My inhaler. - You don't need it. The amount of adrenaline you're gonna have pumped through your system will see you through. What you got to worry about is getting a good start. - [Announcer] Lane two, Rhodes Raymer, Detroit Union High. Lane three, Benjamin Walling Jr., John Glenn High. Lane four, Jeremy Walling, Wilfred Laurier High. - Go, Buddy. - Runners, take your marks. (gentle music) Set. (gunshot blares) - False start. Lane four. - That was Jeremy, your boy there. (gentle music) - I want you to do it again, okay? It's screwing up Raymer. I need this race. Did dad tell you? - Yeah, yeah, he told me. - All right, baby. - Stay cool, fellas. Stay cool. - Don't look like Raymer was too happy about that. - Runners, take your marks. - [Ben] Stay cool, fellas. Stay cool. - [Announcer] Set. (gunshot blares) - You got it, Buddy. You got it. Keep the pace. - Run, run, run, run, run. - It's yours, Buddy. It's all yours now, baby. Take it. - Run, run, run, run. - Bring it home! Bring it home! (crowd cheering) - Yes! - Your younger son just ran the race of his life. - Yeah, I wish he would have done that another day. - Beth! Beth! (crowd laughing) - Jeremy, yo. - Beth, wait. - What are you doing? Stop. Would you stop? Turn around and talk to me. Don't you walk away from me. Jeremy! Get back here. - Beth! - How could you do that, Jeremy? You ambushed him right from the start. - Dad, I won the race. Why can't you just be happy for me? - Happy for you? Do you know how embarrassing this is for Buddy and me? - Embarrassing? You know what, grow up. - Don't ever push me, you ungrateful, little... - Hey, hey, whoa, whoa! - You get out of here? Get of my face! - Cool down, cool down. Go on. Enjoy your victory. - Yeah. Yeah, go on. Go on. That's right, go on. Yeah, join your little girlfriend down there. And your mother while you're at it. The three of you deserve each other. What are you looking at? You just stay the hell out of my family, mister. - You're a fool. - Oh yeah. Another Canadian, ey. Yeah, that's it. Walk away. Oh, Jesus. Oh... God! - What a mess. - I know, and it's not gonna go away for either of us. Are you coming with me? - You know, you're a real pain. I'm not letting you go anywhere. - Close enough. - You know, we're gonna get through this because for the first time in my life, I don't care what happens. - For the first time, I feel happy for somebody else. - Oh, yeah? Who? - You, dummy. You think that's love. - Or a different kinda feels good. - Don't mock my pain. I'm having a breakthrough. When I saw you win up there, I felt like I won. That's gotta be real love, doesn't it? So that's a yes, right?
