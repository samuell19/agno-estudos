Don't worry, I'll be back. What's going on? Look here Dimitri. We know you have weapons. You will give us some. We need fifty rifles and a thousand bullets... Leave me alone you idiot. What makes you so sure that I've got weapons? Don't bother your heart won't stand it. The British officer is always at your house. What are you talking about? Your precious collection? Don't play with me. Look here. I sell weapons to Russians. I have no weapons for you. You will have my friend. You'll see. Just as the Armenian guerillas did, obviously you want to have the Turks and... ...Greeks at each others throats. We are all Ottomans. Exactly what harm have they done to us? You're talking too much, give us weapons. Orwe'll be back! Let's go... Sir are you ok? Hop hop! What are you doing man? You almost gave us a heart attack! I was just being cautious when I saw you with others. I was watching you. This time it's different Jerar. We need to take them to Tuzla. What for? They are running away from the Brits. One condition for my boat... What's that? I come too. Jerar! Don't argue man. You never know what happens at sea. I can't leave you alone. Block head! I wonderwho? Ok then take this! What's this? This time it is not forfun man. We have to be cautious. Come on. Come on Gentlemen, may God be with us. Enver Pasha ran to Germany but by dealing with Lenin he will soon come back... ...with a Caucasian army to start the "War of Independence" in Anatolia. What a noble man you are. Why don't you come with us! No master. Believe me I'm certainly not noble. I am not good for anything anymore. There isn't a front I haven't fought on in Palestine. We had no food, we fried grasshoppers, ate tree bark. You know Cemal Pasha's channel expedition. I was there. We swam in a pool of blood. That bastard Lawrence... I still have the scar he made. I mean there is no battle left I haven't fought in. We couldn't beat the enemy when Germans were with us, how do you think we will now? Look young boy, maybe we lost one war but this doesn't mean Turks will give up. Nowadays we have a navy minister, Hamidiye hero Rauf bey... ...east front commander Karabekir Pasha, Ali Fuat and Mustafa Kemal Pasha. God... well gentlemen it's the end. From here on you're on your own. Come on have a safe trip. May God help you. No man I don't want money. Its for the country. May God be on your side. Thank you. Thank you too. It's a trap! Lay down. Ali! Jerar! Jerar... Are you ok? I'm fine. Ahhhh... fine. Ok ok. Take care of the others. Press on, press on ok press on. Are you ok? - I'm fine, I'm fine ok. - Come on. Are you ok man? Serving our country was not meant to be. This belt is full of gold. Please use it for the salvation of our Khalif. May God bless you! Ok man, don't exhaust yourself. Let's go. Ok, get a move on. Hang on mate. I'll take you to a doctor soon. I'm okay, very good. Stinging a bit, that's all. Your hand. Press this press. Ah... Hang on ok. I'm done with this. There is one bullet left. You might need it. Don't talk man, shut up, you are bleeding badly. Mate... I am shot for the first time. Never mind. I'm proud to be dying for my country. Braveman my braveman, hang on, hang on. I can't believe this Jerar. It was definitely an ambush. I wonderwho told them. Osman Bey? Nadya? Who? We're living through a time when anyone could be prepared to stab you in the back. You're right mate, you are right. We are close, hang on we are close. Jerar? Jerar! Jerar? My brother! My brother! My brother! You were a true sailor, man. Sleep peacefully where you belong. Paper... Paper, the Dardanelles hero Mustafa Kemal Pasha has landed in Samsun. More power to your elbow! Ali, my lad! Welcome. Thank you man. I'm looking for Osman. Have you seen him? No... He wasn't here for a long time, no one saw or heard of him. Interesting. Have you also been hiding away? We get our energy that way. Very well. I'll wash my hands and face to clear my head! You prepare me a nice strong raki. Right away! Hey Turk! Give us some fish, raki... Meze meze... haydari... some meze as well... haydari... Eat shit you bastards... Hurry up... Osmanli is finished! No one has the strength to bring that down. Speak my braveman, speak... Please speak now. Where did you find this gold? Look how many days you've been beaten. Make your life easierfor. Mi?on? Yes... Shut up... What am I to tell them. If I speak, they'll hang me anyway. They're starting again. Bastard. My God. Are you so stubborn? Give them a name you fool and save yourself. Dimitri. Dimitri. Dimitri? I got the gold from Dimitri. A merchant in Kadik?y. Good choice man good choice. What did he say? Never mind. You did well. Shit they are coming. Don't look scared? Shut up, shut up. Why are they silent? Be careful, he knows Turkish. It's not the soldier's fault. I thought you'd heard but obviously not. My husband Dimitri passed away a few days ago. You mean he died? Unfortunately... ...the day he gave you some work, that same day he died. May God have mercy on him. Unfortunately. I'm sorry. They brought you here by mistake but this is important. Do you know this man? Yes! He's ?mer, he worked for my late husband. Where did you find the gold? My husband gave the gold to him. I was there. That's bad. Because its already been registered. We can't give it back. The gold is not important. Accept it as a donation If you wish I can return the gold to you later over dinner perhaps. Really it's not important. Let us get you out of here immediately. Thank you. How could you give the gold? Ali, I beg you. I never stopped thinking about you, every day, every hour... You cannot know how it feels. I was told you died in the war. I was forced to marry a Greek. I prayed for your soul for years. You are alive. Standing right here but worried about a handful of gold. My dear one. Before this dream is over lets go away. Ok ok but... I made a promise. That gold... was the last request... ...of a man who died for his country. I was going to buy weapons to send to Anatolia. You were going to buy weapons? Yes... Dimitri left a bargeful of weapons behind Ali! I don't get it. Dimitri was trading in illegal arms. Actually the cellar is full of gunpowder... Take those guns, give them to whoever you want. In place of gold. You will be keeping your promise too. Then, I beg you, let's run away immediately. From now on I don't everwant anything to remind me of my days without you. Ayoung Greek is here, wants to see you. Bring him. What do you want? I heard you were looking for someone called Knock Out Ali. Yes, do you know where he is? This Knock Out Ali has a married lover. I have seen him roaming around... ...the girl's house. I have been watching the house for some time but Ali is not around. However, there is a British Colonel visiting very often. Named Scott... ...from the Selimiye barracks. You may get information from him. Look this is enough for us to start a new life. I sent Andon and Maria back home. Let us go somewhere else too. Don't worry we will go. Don't leave the house until I come. Ali... ...be careful. Stop puffing up like a toad and spit out your poison... Speak up... There is nothing to say Osman Bey! I couldn't get them to the other side. I'm embarassed. I was not surprised at all that you were the only survivor out of the eight. Since you know the exact details of the trip, You have been following events Osman Bey... Thank God, we have eyes and ears everywhere. News travel fast here... The gold in the belt? What about it? Left in Mufti's belt orwhat? Now you are coming to me to get information from me. I don't like it Ali, this is not yourway. Forgive me Osman Bey... Our country is in such a state... Mufti told me to buy weapons with gold. I bought them. Now I have to get them to Anatolia. Will you help me... ...get the weapons to Anatolia then? I'm surprised you are getting involved in these affairs... Wasn't it you... ...who said 'is it up to us to save this country? I must admit, the last request of old Mufti confused me Osman Bey. Our country is invaded. Mustafa Kemal went to Anatolia... ...with his friends as the 9th army inspector. I cannot forget Kemal Pasha's words... ...of that night. Obviously Pasha is after a fight. Yes... Then read this. Mustafa Kemal issued a statement... "I swear on everything I consider sacred that togetherwith our people... ...I will strive to the end with all my being, for the independence of our country". You see... I am aware of developments too... ...as soon as possible. I will do what is necessary. Now... You get the weapons to me... This way you will carry out Mufti's last request. Bloody whore! Ahhhhhhhhhhh. Nadya! Ali... be careful... What did you do man? Why did you do it? Stop Ali... Let's hearwhat this is all about... Stop stop spy... She was a spy! She was sending wireless messages. I caught her in time! Come on guys, let's get out of here. We have no idea who she was in contact with. I still think you shouldn't have shot her! Agh... I'll have her buried in a Christian cemetery. Yes yes yes Mr. Ali. I see you got used to guns. No no no! If you want your love alive, you have to see me first. Look Guro, let's deal man to man. You want me. First untie her then we can talk. She is innocent. I killed an innocent person because of you. You made me a murderer. I can kill another one. Are you ok? We have to leave now... Come here! Come here! Ali here... ...run! Gunpowder. Hold this. Run to the door. Run! Are you ok? Let's go... Defne... Nothing should separate us ever again... Even death. My beauty, I have to deliver those weapons. You know that. Look at me! After the delivery... I promise you... We will go somewhere, I say I promise you! Come on, they are waiting for us. You will take the boat to Kurna bay with Andon! How come your alive again? You were shot too but you're still alive, why shouldn't I be? You scoundrel! Speak up, tell me who brought you back to life? Your mother! If you don't want to die, speak up or I'll shoot! You asked for this, you bloody fool... Where the hell have you been Ali! I was beginning to worry. Thank you, Kelle. I put the weapons in a safe place. Somewhere along Kurnak?y bay. Good, I'll give you two men so you can go and deliver the weapons. That's not the way it's going to be Osman Bey. Only you and I will go... ...no one else will come with us. Why's that? I'll tell you the reason on the way. Okay then, have it yourway... Usually I have my men follow me like a shadow but... ...this time, if you insist, it'll be only me and my revolver... Kelle... I have something to do... You take care of the place... Ok, Osman Bey! You certainly like taking precautions. I like it... If you only had a little more patriotism in you... ...we could have done a lot together. There are weaknesses in your organization Osman Bey! What are you getting at? In my opinion Nadya wasn't the traitor! Don't beat about the bush lad, tell me what's on your mind... Do you remember that night when you shot and killed ?skelet Musa near... ...Mustafa Kemal Pasha's chalet? Well I saw him at a market place... I killed him a little while ago. In otherwords, he didn't die that night when you shot him. Bugger me! You saw him fall to the ground like a bag of shit didn't you? Let's suppose we were wrong to think he was dead then. What would you say to the fact that he drew his gun as soon as he saw me? I really think someone is playing games with you Osman Bey. Please don't tell me that Nadya did this too... ?opur Talat or ?engel could have done it... Now can you understand why I wanted you to work with me?! It's very hard to find trustworthy men these days. The boat's there... Osman, help me! Osman bey, help me! It's the end Ali... Osman bey ha? Hands up! Vay Cukurcesmeli vay! Osman Bey there are no weapons on this boat. He's tricked us again. Our British friends will be very annoyed! Hosst! Speak up Osman Bey, speak up... Why are you doing this? Ali... I know you don't owe me anything but please do me one last favour. In the name of God... You shot me Ali! Let everyone think the British shot me. Nobody knows I'm a traitor. But I don't understand? Ahh... Why did you do this? The British blackmailed me. They found out I was a member of the police organization. They have taken my sick daughter and wife hostage in Italy. They didn't leave me any other option. I was forced to help them. I'm sorry Ali, I blamed so many people. Shoot me and finish me off. Was Nadya part of your cover? She realised what was going on. She was going to talk! Come on, please shoot me Ali, the British will be here soon... Alright, I'll help you but first, tell me who I should deliver these weapons to. Go to Sile immediately... There's a midwife at the healty center, called M?zeyyen. She is a real patriot. Give the weapons to her. Go Ali, don't waste any more time! Ok. Take this then and do what you have to do! There is only one bullet in it anyway. Ali! Shit, damned bastards. Run away Ali, run away. Very good, give me a kiss. May God bless you. Control the fever every 2 hours. Welcome... Good to meet you. What can I do for you? Midwife M?zeyyen, yes? Yes! Well we... we won't take up too much of your time. Come in please. We have a bargeful of weapons. We want to send them to Anatolia. Who told you to come to me? Cukurcesmeli sacrificed his life today trying to protect the weapons. Unfortunately we lost him during a fight with the British! Where are the weapons now? On a boat anchored close to the shore. But how much do you want for these weapons? Nothing! Good! Let's get to work, we must unload the weapons right away... But wait a moment... I'd like to know exactly where these weapons are going? To Mustafa Kemal Pasha, Ali Bey... You know me? My lieutenant! Welcome to our group! That's that then... We can be on ourway too can't we? What's wrong? I don't know how to say this to you... I've been thinking while watching... ...these mothers, grandparents carring hundreds of kilos on their backs... Look at Lieutenant Recep... He's already lost a leg to the war and yet he's still struggling for... ...the freedom of his country. ...lt makes me feel there is something more important than just us, Defne... Surely our country... What are you saying Ali! Defne... I can't be that selfish and go off to Vienna now. Now I understand. This country will be freed by brave men like you. This Country needs one of us. I have to join the war efforts in anatolia. Ali! Please forgive me Defne! I love you and always will. So will I! Give that to me. Take this. Come on. Come on. Ali.
