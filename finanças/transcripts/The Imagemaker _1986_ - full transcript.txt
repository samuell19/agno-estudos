(anxious electronic, violin music) (anxious violin, flute music) (soft anxious flute, piano music) (anxious synthesized violin music) - Roger. Roger. Roger. Roger. Roger. (distorted screaming) (wailing) Roger. Roger. Roger, it's time to get up. I said it's time to get up, honey. ♪ Oh Roger get up, oh roger get up please ♪ ♪ Roger get up this morning Oh, forsook my love, is there no way in which this poor maiden can make thee arise? That's not what I meant and you know it. Look I've got an idea, I'm gonna make you a fresh pot of coffee and as soon as it's ready if you're still in bed, I'll pour you a cup, put in just a little touch of cream and bring it upstairs and pour it all over your-- You sleep well, honey? - Uh-huh. - Now get your ass out of that bed. I can't see you. - Sorry. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You look even better clean. - Thank you. - Smooth shaven would be nice too. - You got it. - Go over this place a couple of times, okay? - What are you talking about? - You missed this place on your chin yesterday. - I did? - You did. Coffee's ready, come and get it. - [Roger] Not quite finished getting dressed. - All right, I'll keep it warm. You want me to switch over to the news? - Yeah. - All right but as soon as it's over, I want you down in this kitchen, you got me? - I gotcha. - And now, here's the news. - Hot on the trail as usual is our gal in Washington Molly Grainger. In her first report today, yet another member of Congress learns what it means to be On the Spot With Molly. - The Washington political scene has played host to just about every kind of ladies man. But Congressman Ned Thompson seems to be the first of a new breed. During his first term, he quickly earned the name Get 'Em to Bed Ned because despite his conjugal state, he tried to woo everything in skirts. - And they call that news. - They do. - And I call you very late. - Coming. - You know, you doddle when you get dressed Roger. I mean that's what the problem is. Although I must admit I kinda like watching your trial to decide what to wear every morning. But you know something sweetie, I like you in just about every color under the sun. No really, it's a matter I've given some thought to. I think you look terrific in just about anything. I kinda like you bare-chested too when it's appropriate. So Roger my sweet, whatever it's going to be, will you just put it on, button it up, tuck in your tail, I mean your shirt tail and get your magnificent self down to this kitchen. Ah, there you are, a sight for sore eyes. (anxious violin tones) Me, oh I've got lots of plans for today, mm hmm. Oh no, I'm sure I-- (television squeaking) And get your magnificent self down into this kitchen. Ah, there you are, a sight for sore eyes. Me, oh I've got lots of plans for today, mm hmm. Oh no, I'm sure I'm not lonely. Yes, I like it here. I believe in what you're doing, yeah, and I've got lots of interesting things to do. If I tell you my plans now, I won't have any surprises for you when you come home tonight. Go on, get out of here okay? Have a wonderful day. Come home as soon as you can. Come home to me. - [Reporter] Good morning, it's seven a.m. in the nation's capital and here are the top stories of the day. The struggle continues for control of the 99th Congress as political pollsters seem to be at odds over who is ahead in the race for the 27 open seats in the House. Democratic advisors-- - [DJ] There's some music for Halloween Morning, The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas. Indeed it is October the 31st. There's a sense of mild around this morning. We're looking for a high-- - Rog, why the fuck are you always so late? - Oh Christ, give me a break. You really look like shit. - Look the only reason I do this every morning is to keep your goddamn body alive. - How late the President keep you up last night? - 'Til three. - All nighters at the White House, I remember them well. - I swear I think Richard Manning is trying to do us in. - Makes sense to me, you croak, it gives the bastard a chance to demand prime time. - A 43 Nielsen with a 45 share. - And re-elected. - I'm glad you find it so amusing. We're talking an election year, Roger. I think you've forgotten what it's like. - I haven't forgotten what it's like and I'll tell you something pal, I don't miss it. (grunting) - [Chet] I think I'm having a coronary. - [Roger] You're not having a coronary. You just stay up too late. - [Chet] Hey Rog, I'm your friend right? - If you say so. - Roger. - Yes Chet, you're my friend. - [Chet] I write speeches for the President, all right? - What is this, 20 questions? - No, I'm making a point. I know the lay of the land. - Oh, we talking girls here? - [Chet] In a way, yes. - [Roger] Who? - Molly Grainger. Roger, you do not need this. - Got the fridge. (anxious light ensemble tones) - Son of a bitch, why'd you have to involve me? - It sounds to me like you listened to it. What do you think? - I think I know why we're being followed. I should have thrown the damn tape in the river. - You think it's real? - Jesus, I hope not. - [Roger] But you think it is. - Roger, this thing could bring down the entire administration. - No kidding. It sounds to me like you think it's real. - I don't know what I think. - I'm gonna use it tonight. - On TV? - If it checks out, yeah. - They'll never let you. - Wanna bet? - [Reporter] Four Americans are dead tonight in El Salvador following a plane crash in a heavy rainstorm. The four were working for the Central Intelligence Agency and were on a surveillance-- - Molly, Molly, don't be so long. - [Molly] What? - Your second story's about to air. - What did you say? - [Martin] Your story's about to come on. - Is that all? Listen, I have got a story for you. How do you think this would look every night coast to coast on your evening news? "Tonight in Beirut, representatives of--" - With or without the robe? - Whatever, I got another story for you. "In an exclusive interview with Kremlin leaders, "this humble reporter--" - Oh I love it, I love it. You know if I had the final say, you would be a network anchor lady as of tonight. - When I'm sitting across from your superstar anchorman, I'll do it in the nude. - Oh, that's a deal. - [Molly] But as your national correspondent in charge of muck, I feel I should be more demure. - This you call demure? - It has been implied by reliable sources that Deputy Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Crimpton was fired because, and I never thought I'd use this expression, "Lizzy Crimpton is a dumb broad." Yeah, that's demure. - For you, perhaps. - Look Martin, she practically begged me for the interview. That's what they do, they call me. I'm tired of this stuff, I want to get back to hard news. - You mean you would leave all of this so that you could sit at a hot studio every night? - Yes. Martin, I have graced your network with this shit twice every morning for the last three years, I've paid my dues. - Calm down. Come back to bed. - Sorry, I don't have time. You can take the shuttle of your choice back to New York. I'm a working girl, remember? (knocking) - Roger. It's been so long, how many years? - Three, Morris. - Only three? You look well. Better. - You too. - You liar. - I have a tape. - Always getting down to business, always work. Running, running, running. I didn't smell the smoke, so where's the fire? What do you want this time? - I need to know if the people on it were really talking to each other or if it's been doctored. - You came to Morris for something so easy? - This one is very sophisticated, if it's a phony. - Morris will be able to tell. - It's very important. - Yes. I can tell. Stop fretting, my dear friend. I'm telling you it's a piece of cake, huh? - Ah, you forgot something. - Oh, thank you. Come, come, come, come, come. I will show it to you. Now look. (low, anxious tones) This is, what is the expression? State of the art. Now, look. Top of the line, the height of sophistication, yes? - How long will it take? - I know, I know. With you, I should've finished the job yesterday. - I need it by the end of the day. - [Morris] So you will have it by the end of the day. - [Roger] Morris, it's urgent. - [Morris] So what else is new? If you will just please to tell me, who's supposed to be on this? - Richard Manning. - And? - [Roger] Tony LaCorte. - Shit. (telephone ringing) - Good morning. - Morning. - The danish is for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Pressing messages or urgent mail? - Messages. - Senator Cummings wants to have dinner on Thursday. - [Molly] No. - See, will you need a remote tonight? - I don't know yet. - Ned Get 'Em to Bed Thompson's office called. - Next. - Your secretary in or out? - Out. - Going. - Bye. - [Man] File tape number 05634, files on Roger Blackwell. - Want to make it big tonight on the sly or maybe just meet someone for a drink and you're well, inconveniently married? If you're in the top echelons of the Federal government, this is a good place to get the job done. For Richard Manning's top aides, this watering hole has become the place. It's dark, it's chic and it's within walking distance of the White House. I would give you the address but that would be indiscrete, don't you think? If you want it though, why don't you call the President's Media Advisor Roger Blackwell? They say he comes here a lot. From somewhere in Washington, this is Molly Grainger. (television squeaking) Mr. Blackwell, do you have a moment? - Sure. - Can you give us the reason behind the President's firing his Chief Economic Advisor today? - The President did not fire him, the man resigned. - Well some people are saying that he was made to resign because he failed to clear a recent television appearance with your office? - Is that what some people are saying? - What was your advice to the President? - As to whether he should accept the resignation? - [Molly] Yes. - Well it sounds to me like if I tell you that I agreed with the President, you'll conclude it was my idea. - Well that is the impression some of the President's other advisors have been creating. - Oh really, who? - Thank you very much, Mr. Blackwell. It appears to be power-grabbing time for our new media czar. (television squeaking) Roger Blackwell, the President's Media Advisor has finally been booted out of the White House, a development this reporter has been predicting for the past several months. In a carefully worded statement, President Manning announced it is Mr. Blackwell's resignation. But we know better, already Blackwell's ouster has caused some consternation in the-- (church bell tolls) - You're new here, aren't ya? The last guy that worked here, Sal found the guy in Tibet, he was a Sherpa. He was the only guy he could find that could climb these stairs all day without dying. He finally left, he couldn't take it anymore. You look like you're working out quite a lot. I've been working out for about a year now. I'm hoping that in another two years, my legs will look like your arms. Where is he, on the roof? - Take your clothes off or I'll take 'em off for you. - Hey Blackwell, good to see you again. Sit down, make yourself at home. - Sal I think you've been watching too many gangster movies. (laughs) - It beats a frisk though, don't it? If you want to talk about the tape, let's talk. - What's to talk about? It's the most incredible piece of crap I've ever heard, I don't believe a word of it. - Then why are you here? - Come on, Sal. You expect me to believe the President of the United States cut a deal with you guys? - Like I said, so why are you here? - When was it made? - Four years ago and a couple months before the election. - Where? - Manning spoke before our National Convention and then afterwards he and LaCorte talked. - Who else was there? - Nobody, Manning, LaCorte. - And a tape recorder. - You get the picture. - And now in a fit of true patriotism, you've decided to release the tape. - Yeah, patriotism that's it, yeah. - That's very patriotic, especially since LaCorte dropped dead a few months ago. - Look Roger, after what Manning did you to, what the fuck do you care? Now the tape is genuine, that's all that counts. - And you want me to use it on TV? - [Sal] Yeah. - What's in it for you? - For me? His ass. After we delivered our union support, that bastard Manning double-crossed us. Now are you gonna use it or not? - I don't know, Sal. - Don't fuck with me, Roger. (telephone rings) - Blackwell and Caine. No, Mr. Blackwell is not, just a moment please. Are you here? Congressman Lyons' Campaign Manager? I'm sorry, I thought I just saw his car pull out. - I love you. - Yes, we have the number. - Top of the morning to do, Byron Caine. - Rog, I gotta talk to you. - Sounds good, I'll be back in a sec. - Don't reach for that, you know that's not good for you. Come on now, you really have something to feel proud about. You did this all yourself, the meat, the green vegetable, the baked tomato, the potato juice, shit. - [Director] Cut. Cynthia, what's wrong? Are you trying to give these old folks the runs? - Marsha, I want you to cut 125 feet out of my home program. - Where, which part? - Right after the news and also cut the section about the ring. - Yeah, I'm not sure we have a copy. - I'll pick it up from you later. (anxious violin tones) - Arthur do me a favor, just give me a summary. - Here. - Is that a six or a zero? - Zero. - And that? - A zero, no that's a six. - You'd better have Roberta type this up. - That won't change the bottom line, Byron. Now look, you pay me to do the books-- - All right, just give me the bottom line. - That's just crazy, your bread and butter is political work and Roger's saying no every time you get a call from the Hill. I'd really love to know what he thinks is gonna keep us going. It sure as hell isn't that feature film he wants to make. - Byron, it's almost 11 and you asked me to remind you to make a call. - All right, I'll take care of it, Arthur excuse me. I gotta make a phone call, I think it's one you might approve of. - You understand what I've been saying? - I understand. - I really think you oughta scrap the feature, money is too tight right now or at least put it on the back-burner. (phone ringing) - [Operator] Good morning, the Hoyle residence. - This is Byron Caine and I have an appointment to speak to Ambassador Hoyle. - [Operator] Just a moment please. - [Margaret] Hello, this is Margaret Hoyle. - Mrs. Hoyle I'm sorry, I meant to ask for your husband. - [Margaret] Mr. Caine, I hope you don't mind. Robert asked me to take your call. He's been waiting for an overseas line all morning and it just came through and, well what he asked me to tell you is that we both read the script and thought it was first-rate. We were quite impressed. - I'm delighted. - Robert also asked me to tell you that if you're still looking for investors, we'd love to talk to you. We're free for lunch. - Today? - Is that possible? - Yes of course. - Fine. Then we'll see you at 12:30 here, thank you. - Thank you. - So what's up, Byron? I get it, full financing for the feature. - Right, maybe. - Grant's comin' in for the full five million? - I didn't say that. - What the hell you saying? - Look just let me do it first, okay? Then we can both go out and get falling down drunk. - Byron, if anybody else was my partner and gave me a line of crap like that-- - Hey, we still have to proceed as planned tonight. - We, it's we now is it? You're gonna be there in front of the cameras with me tonight? - No. - Hey why not? Come on Byron, then you can be the one that could show all the people the media tricks that I used to get Manning elected President. Better still, we could switch jobs altogether. You could tell all the folks out in TV land about my career and I could stay home and get laid. - I think each of us should do what he does best. (buzzing) - Yeah? Yeah, send her in. - Molly? - Yeah, she's on her way in. - Good luck. - You know what I'm looking forward to most? - Oh, don't stop now. - Sorry, privileged communication. - What's that? Hi Byron. - Hi. - Roger. - Molly, nice to see you again. - I'm certainly glad to hear that. So I've cleared my decks Roger, what's up for today? - A day in the life of Roger Blackwell. - Could you make that a little sexier? - How about former political filmmaker on the eve of his first feature film? - It's in the can? - Not yet but it will be. - Have you started shooting? - We're just about to. - So I hear you're doing Capital Idea tonight. - Yeah. - It'll be fun. I haven't been back to Channel Five since I went national. - Well you can think of it as slimming. - [Richard] Mr. LaCorte might be feeling quite nervous about our meeting alone like this. - [Tony] Sure, sure I understand. (anxious ensemble tones) - As simple as that? - Yeah, as simple as that. - [Richard] In return for? - [Tony] What makes you think I want something, especially from the next President of the United States? - Mike, I want you to keep the boom as high as possible so we can get natural sound, okay? - You got it. - Bill, you got enough cable to follow the Congressman down to the reflecting pool? - I've got it covered tight and swift. - I get it, a real man in a real place right? - That's the deal. - Deals? I don't make deals. - You ask me whatever questions you want and those I want to answer, I'll answer. - Just like we did it last time? - You know considering the part that your little TV news features played in my life-- - Roger, the stuff I did on television was not the reason the President asked you to leave. - No, it just got the ball rolling. - Look, I don't think we're gonna get anywhere going over old ground. Why don't you tell me the new ground? - It's my turn for an expose. If anybody knows media politics, this boy does. - Yes I know, 21 successful campaigns, let's see. 17 members of Congress, three Governors and one President of these United States. - That's pretty good. - And now your film's gonna show us every trick in the book and the true if someone unpleasant nature of some of your more famous clients? - Let the chips fall wherever the chips fall. - Sounds fascinating, I'll ask to do the review. - Fine but I've got a story for you right now. - Uh-huh, the money isn't all in and you figured I owed you. - You know I really would appreciate it if you'd stop throwing salt in the direction of my wounds, they're simply not gonna open. - Sounds like they already have. I wouldn't say this project is being born out of tranquility. - You can draw any conclusions you like. - Just give you the press. - That's the deal. - Like I said, no deals. - Look at it this way, it's juicy, you can sink your teeth into it. You could do another blockbuster just like old times. - It sounds tempting. - It's just the sort of thing to help a girl get an anchor desk. You're a famous lady, people like to talk. Make up your mind, here comes part of the story. - I tried to reach you all morning. I thought we'd gone back to the good old days when Mr. Blackwell was always in a meeting. - Good to see you again too, Charlie. Molly Grainger, Dave Lyons. - We know one another. - Yes, hi Dave. Do you have a few minutes? - Charlie? - My pleasure, Molly. - I just want you to know I really love the idea of having Molly Grainger along. - [Roger] Well the Congressman seems to like her. - He likes to hear his name on TV. - Rog, we've got a little problem. It seems that these gentlemen have-- - I don't think we need another opinion. Mr. Blackwell is here to film anything Congressman Lyons has to say. As soon as his crew is set up, they can start shooting immediately. - What kinda changes do you wanna make, Charlie? - They've written a little speech. - Let me see it. Charlie, is this for real? - I tell 'em, Dave Lyons' polls make him out to be the bigot of Congress and they come up with something that's got him sounding like a Dixiecrat. Listen, either you show this joker really responding to people, particularly the black people or you can put your man in a pine box and cart him back home. We are two weeks away from the election. - We've never had to do this kinda thing before. - Black people in your little Virginia district never got it together before. - I will not subject the Congressman to this-- - Oh, cut the crap, the Congressman. - I think we oughta do it the way I wrote it. (tepid trumpet music) - If the people vote me back into office, we're gonna have some more of those good years with more and more jobs, bigger and better schools-- - Mister, you've been doing a lot of talking and I think I finally figured out what you're really saying. You know what's best for black people, right? - Not in so many words. - Take all the words you need. - Well I, I think my voting record has been in the best interest of all Americans. - Oh, so you mean to say it's in my interest not to have a job? - [Dave] Of course not. - And for my kids to go to a lousy school and live in a crummy house? - You're misinterpreting-- - I'm not misinterpreting nothing. You can use all the fancy words you like but I'm telling you what's going down and I'm asking you, what are you gonna do about it? - Well, Charlie. - Excuse me, would you mind leaving? Just stop the goddamn camera, Roger. - Keep rolling. - You've had eight years to come up with your answer, mister and if you don't have it by now, I don't see why anyone should vote you another two years to look for it. - I'll stand on my record. - Bullshit. You're a goddamn bigot, that's what you are. - No, I'm not gonna get down in the dirt and grovel with you. I am made of different stuff. I fight for decency for all Americans. That's too important to me, too important to me to let people like you, people who hate and do nothing else, shout out a few names, grab the limelight and expect the rest of the world to bow to them. I'm gonna fight for jobs and schools and decent housing but I'm gonna fight for them with dignity and I don't care if you never get out of your crummy house and your kids keep going to that lousy school because maybe that's what they and you deserve. You got that, nigger? - Cut. Thank you everybody, that's all we need. - [Dave] What's happened here Charlie, why is he laughing? - Nice working with you, Congressman. - What's he mean nice working with me? What the fuck's going on here, Charlie? - I don't know yet. (tepid trumpet music) - I believe that you know this is our first time out with something like this. Margaret has always wanted a project in this line. - And this one seemed rather interesting to us. - Not to belittle your reputation in any way, we understand it's considerable but I want you to know that what attracted us to the project was Roger Blackwell. - I wasn't aware that you knew Roger. - We don't really know him but-- - But we served in the same administration only when he had his appointment, we had already accepted our post and we were out of the country. - More to the point, we liked what we read which is why, and I hope you don't mind, we showed the script to a few people and well, the point of it is that we could do the whole thing. - You mean the full five million? - Yes. However one of our friends, someone who's been involved with film before, he raised a very interesting point. Our friend said Roger Blackwell may not be exactly the right person to make this film. Roger Blackwell he feels was too close to the President. He had too much power. - It's his project. - A film is the producer's project, isn't that right? - Look, there is really no way that I could consider your proposal. - [Robert] My proposal? - Eliminating Roger from the film. - I haven't proposed that but since you've raised the issue, let's for discussions sake say that you would be interested in making the film without Mr. Blackwell. - Mr. Hoyle, your friend who's been involved with film before may know how to work something like this but I don't and frankly I don't think I'm interesting in learning. - Well what are you interested in, more money so you can buy out Mr. Blackwell out of the project? - Look, I really think I oughta get back to my office. - No, I understand. When you've had a chance to think over our little talk-- - I really don't think I'm gonna change my mind. - In these cases, one always reviews the budget and if five million begins to look a little thin... - All right, so only you and Simon knew that black guy was gonna lay into Lyons? - Nope, the black guy knew too. - I don't think I have all the pieces here. - Oh come on, what makes you say that? - You still like to play cat and mouse, don't you? - Is that what we're doing? - He asked purringly. - What's the fun in learning all my secrets if you don't have to dig for some of them? - All right, what are you gonna say on Capital Idea tonight? - Oh, that's not digging, that's direct. - Excuse me, I know I shouldn't disturb you but you're Molly Grainger, aren't you? - Yes. - Would you mind, do you think, I watch you every day. - Have you got something I can write on? - [Fan] Yeah, I think I do. Yes. - Great. - And a pen? - Oh yeah, I think I do. A pen, a pen, a pen, I can't see-- - Here you go. - Oh, thanks Rog. - Thank you. - Sure. - And thank you. - You're welcome. - If she only knew. - Knew what? - [Molly] Who you are about to become. - I'm just glad she didn't remember who I was. - [Molly] You know there's a part of me that really hates this town. - That's good. I really think a measure of distaste for Washington is very healthy, it puts you in touch with the rest of the country. - Sometimes I feel like there's a hatchet hanging over the whole damn city. - You'll love New York. - I guess part of me is drawn to sharp edges, huh? - Well you sure know how to pick 'em. - I'm going after that anchor job if I can get it. - You know something, you're not laughing as much as you used to. - Really? - It's a sign of loneliness. Did you know that? - No, I didn't. - Been doing some research. - How, by talking to sour-looking people on the Metro? - No, I'm doing a pilot for cable television. It's for people who live by themselves, can't get out. I'm just beginning to experiment making videotapes to help you get up in the morning, get you through the day. Sort of be a companion to you. I know it sounds a little different but I think it's gonna work. - Your idea? - Mm hmm. - You know I'm beginning to think that Roger Blackwell, the Presidential Media Advisor kept a lot of parts of himself hidden. - On the other hand, maybe you're just becoming more perceptive. - Could be. - Or maybe I'm just feeling more comfortable talking to you. - Do you? - I don't know. - So, what are you planning to say on Capital Idea tonight? - How about that three years ago, you and I had an affair. - I was wondering when we were gonna get around to that. - [Briefer] James Reinhardt, occupation, Bureau Chief, This Week Magazine.

I know people who use them all the time. - I can't imagine who you're talking about. (knocking) - Emergencies only, enter at your own peril. - Roger, I had told Roberta to ask you to come see me as soon as you got in. - Yeah I know, this is a rush, I'll be there in a minute. - Now Roger, please. - My master calls.

Now I thought it over, I don't think we need her anymore. - Come on Byron, you knew exactly what was gonna happen on that shoot. - It's not because of that. - Then what? - It's because of what she might to do us if she sees something we don't want her to see. - Which is exactly why the lady has an escort. - All right, now what kind of coverage do you think she would give us now? I mean just going with what she's got so far. - I don't know. - Oh come on, Roger. - Good, sympathetic, maybe tinged with a sense of guilt. - [Byron] Then let's call it a day. - What the hell are you really getting at, Byron? - [Roger] I'm talking about chance of you fucking things up. - Me fucking things up? I am doing everything exactly as we planned. - Well it seems like you've been making a few mistakes. - You want take over, you want to take over tonight? - [Roger] That's not what I'm talking about. - What the hell are you talking about? - Checking in and letting me know what's going on every once in awhile. - Yeah Byron, well you know it's been a really slow day. I've been wondering how to kill time. Shit man, I could've been on the phone talking to you instead of taking care of business. - I want to go over exactly what we're doing tonight point by point. - Don't talk to me like a goddamn kid, all right? - Roger, everything we have is riding on this. - I know what's at stake here. - No you don't. This morning I got an offer to finance the film. - Yeah, who'd you get an offer from, Grant? - Somebody else. - Who, goddammit? - I don't want to get into it. - Stop jerking me around Byron, what's the offer? - I told you I'm not getting into it. He's got conditions, all right? - Well I got a message for your backer with conditions. You tell him to go fuck himself and then you can do the same goddamn thing. We're doing this my way start to finish. - Have you seen Roger? - He just left. - Left? - An emergency. - I see. - [Roberta] Oh but he asked me to tell you to meet him at Channel Five later tonight. - Where are they shooting that cable pilot? He asked me to have a look. - [Roberta] Studio B, down the hall to your left. - [Director] Cynthia, take it from "Go slowly, as slowly as you need to," okay? - Can I help you? - Hi, I'm Molly Grainger. - Oh hi. - Have a seat. Just about to wrap the shoot. - [Director] I've got a tight shot on, medium shot on one. Camera two, give me a tight shot of her fingers. We're going to begin on one, and go, cue her. - Go slowly, as slowly as you need to. All we're trying to do is keep the blood flowing in your fingers, just keep opening and closing your hands. It might help to think of them as flowers with each finger being a petal. You're making the flowers open. It feels good, doesn't it? It's a nice way to start out the day. - [Director] Cut, okay Cynthia thanks, you can go now. - Thanks, I was beginning to feel like Godzilla. - [Director] Take five, everybody. - Bye y'all. (knock) - Hi, I'm Molly Grainger. - Hi. - You've been in some things in town, haven't you? - Uh-huh. - At Arena Stage, right? - Yeah, once or twice. - I knew I recognized you. Cigarette? - No thanks. - Are you enjoying working on the pilot? You sounded so into it on the set. - Yeah, I suppose. - I guess you've been shooting since this morning. - I don't know when we started, I do it now in my sleep. - Roger seems quite excited about the project. - Yeah, he is. - Are you? - Why are you talking to me? - [Molly] I'm interested in Roger's work. I'm doing a story about him. - Ah, was he cool with your last one? - No. How did you hit on the character you play? - It's just something I happen to do pretty well. - Do you use other characters in the series? - Uh-uh. - Oh, I see. So they had a character in mind and you-- - I was sleeping with Roger. - I'm sorry. I really wasn't fishing for that. I'm just intrigued, the idea for the pilot seems so fascinating. - I'm glad I turned you on. - I guess working on it though can be kind of wearing, huh? - You want a story, then just say so. You ever hear of a writer basing his characters on people he knew? - Of course. - Roger wanted one better. - [Molly] What do you mean? - Did you know his wife? - No, I never met her, she died when-- - No, she didn't. - I think you're mistaken, she committed suicide. - Ellen Blackwell lives. - You're saying the character you're playing is modeled after Roger's wife? So what's the rest of it? - The rest of it is he's still living with her. - What's that supposed to mean? - It doesn't sound like Roger's told you very much about the beginnings of this whole venture, the famous secret tape he made. You really must ask to see it. Better yet, just get yourself invited over to his place. It just snaps on as soon as you open the door. - What are you talking about? - Me, as his wife. In glorious color and stereophonic sound. Roger told me it would help him with the other segments of the pilot if we made one first for his personal use. I'm timed to awaken him every morning and I shut off as soon as he goes out the door. - I don't believe you. What did he do, throw you over? - I haven't heard it put that way in a long time. - Well that's what it sounds like. You start telling me things like that-- - Hey. You came to me, Ms. Grainger. - Matt Grant Productions. - Matt Grant please. - Who's calling? - Byron Caine. - [Secretary] I'll see if he's in. - [Matt] Byron, how are things back East? - I just wanted to let you know everything is set for tonight. - [Matt] You are gonna have your own cameras in the TV studio, aren't you? - Absolutely and my lawyer tells me we will own every piece of footage. - [Matt] Great, how's Roger? - Fine, he's all right. - [Matt] Sounds like there's a problem. - Hey don't worry, it's nothing to worry about, I'll handle it. Everything's under control. - Byron I guarantee you, the studio's in for the whole five million. Just make it work tonight and call me when it's over. - All right. (anxious light piano, violin music) (phone ringing) - [Operator] Good afternoon, the Hoyle residence. (dial tone beeps) (relaxed guitar music) - [Molly] So, what are you planning to say on Capital Idea tonight? - [Roger] How about that three years ago you and I had an affair. - [Molly] I was wondering when we were gonna get around to that. ♪ In a room ♪ At the end of the hall ♪ In the darkness ♪ Whispering lies ♪ Are two strangers somehow strangely familiar ♪ ♪ With a sadness ♪ That darkness can't hide ♪ Like two actors ♪ Reciting old stories ♪ They each lead together ♪ But they both know their lines ♪ ♪ It's a dream that I'm having ♪ And I'm locked inside and I can't get free ♪ ♪ Of the dream that I'm having ♪ Where they're watching me but I just can't see ♪ ♪ No, I just can't see their faces ♪ (tires screech) (telephone ringing) - Old hat. - [Richard] You're crazy. - I didn't say legalize-- (tape squeaking) I didn't say legalize it, just lower their budget.

Why was I ordered back in here when I'm in the middle-- - Calm down. - Of a story. - That's what I want to talk to you about. - You have a short memory. We could've talked about that this morning. - Why didn't you tell me it was Roger Blackwell? - Jealous, Martin that's not your style. - I want to know about the story, what you're going to say. - Why? - Nevermind that. The story. Please Molly. - I don't know, I'm still doing it. But I can tell you what it's not gonna be. It's not gonna be like last time. - That's not what they want, they want you to nail him. - You son of a bitch. - Molly, we're friends, good friends. I wouldn't ask you to do this if it didn't have to be done. - Goddammit, once was enough. - Molly-- - No. - [Operative] Good evening, Ms. Grainger. - I'm sorry. - May I first say how much I have enjoyed following your career. You've certainly come a long way since our initial meeting. If you don't mind, I would like to get down to business. Perhaps you remember the nature of our last conversation? If not, perhaps I'll refresh your memory. Simply put, we agreed to well, shall we say open certain doors for you here in Washington. To provide you with valuable information and invaluable contacts, is that correct? I must say that you accomplished much, much more than we ever thought possible and then, oh and then there was your part of the understanding. To create some rather nasty pieces about Roger Blackwell. - What do you want? - Roger Blackwell, Ms. Grainger, Roger Blackwell. - I've already done that. What could he possibly do to you now? - Three years ago we relieved Mr. Blackwell of his enormously growing authority, passed it onto others, team players. Now he's presenting us with another problem. We have an election coming up and we prefer that his motion picture not be made. - And? - And very simply, we want a repeat performance. Only this time, we want his credibility destroyed completely. The Chairman of your network tells me that you would be just perfect for the anchor desk. - And if I don't do what you want? - Well very frankly Ms. Grainger, we've never considered the possibility. Good evening. - Surveillance reports no new developments on Brodkin. - We still have a few hours before Blackwell's appearance on television, I submit we wait it out. - Sir, I think you should consider another option. - Which is? - That we go in immediately and secure the tape. - Mr. Griffin, are you suggesting that the White House initiate overt illegal action? - Sir with all due respect, the present activities of our surveillance operation are highly-- - Are within bounds Mr. Griffin, we are within bounds. Now a significant difference exists between our current activities and the nature of your proposal. The question is not a legal nor moral nor ethical one. Those issues are quite simply irrelevant. The essential question is one of pursuing a course of action that does not exceed the limits of authority. We have not exceeded those nor do I intend to do so unless there is a clear and present danger. - Sir, I submit such a situation exists. - Our course of action will be to continue to maintain surveillance. - And if that proves to be inadequate? - Mr. Griffin, I take responsibility. (anxious violin tones) - Roger, is that you? I know it's late but that's okay, duty calls. Hey Rog, you got a good joke for me? No, I do not want to hear the one about the mouse and the-- - Ellen, I really do miss you. (telephone ringing) - [Richard] I'll maintain the current budget without increase for two years and change the people at the top. - [Tony] Three years and we get to pick the Director. - [Richard] Done. (knocking) - Hi, are you all right? - [Roger] What do you mean? - Your secretary said something about an emergency. - [Roger] I had to go see Dave Lyons. Come on in. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. How about a drink? - Hmm, just one? - [Roger] A woman after my own heart, scotch? - Scotch sounds perfect. I love your new place. Three years ago, did you ever think you and I would be having a drink together? - I don't remember what I was thinking three years ago. I don't think I want to think about it now. - To your new career. - To yours. - To buried hatchets. - To buried hatchets. I have to get ready for the show, will you excuse me for a minute? I'll just be a minute. (low, anxious violin music) - I really missed you, I want you to know that. It's nice to hear you say that. Have you had your dinner? Sure, it's okay to go out alone. I don't mind, I'm not really hungry anyway. I want to wait up for you. I want to see you before you go to sleep. I won't say it, I know you don't like me to say it. All right. Tell me what happened today. Well I am glad to hear that, I was hoping that would happen. I don't believe it. - Find what you're looking for? Or didn't they tell you there's a monitor in every room? - Well if you didn't want me to see this, you shouldn't have left me alone in your living room. - [Roger] Yeah maybe you're right, maybe I wanted to see just how far you'd go. Something like this could get you exactly what you want, couldn't it? - What do you mean? - Don't play games, Molly. The anchor job. Tell me something, just how many times do you plan on sticking it to me? - This story won't do that and you know it. - Come on Molly, we both know your talent for sinking your fangs into something and then stretching it and twisting it into anything you want. - My stories are based on reliable sources always. - Reliable, they're nothing, you just relied on 'em to get your goddamn network job. Goddammit, this is part of my life. You stay the hell away from it. I get it, you never got to finish your series, did you? So now you're gonna put a cap on it. Former image maker to the President won't let dead wife rest in peace, is that it? - No. Look, I'm sorry about Ellen but I reported what happened. You're the one who's making up lies, don't you see that? (thud) - You will not report anything about my wife. - I'll go. (anxious violin, piano tones) - Where's the rest of it? Where's the rest of it? To buried hatchets. Why Molly? Did you really need to carve me up again? - They made me do it. They're the ones who wanted the story on you last time and they want it this time. - Who? - Goddammit Roger, you were in the White House. You know exactly who I'm talking about. - Yes. I guess I do. Back away from the desk. I said back up. (light anxious piano tones) Keep going, I'll tell you when to stop. Right there. Now, take off your clothes. - I don't believe this. - Do you believe this? Now take off your clothes. (gun clicks) Lucky, let's try again. Have you sent the folks at the network any recent tapes? No? Well by all means, let me send them a copy of this one. - You're really crazy. - You've never called me that before, you know that? You've called me just about everything else but never that. - They won't buy it, they'll know you forced me to do it. - Who, your reliable sources? - They'll know you were trying to blackmail me. - You're absolutely right but you know what? It won't make any difference because when they see this tape, no matter how or why it was made, you don't get the anchor desk. You see Molly when you're in the public eye, you just can't afford a scandal, believe me. I know all about it. (gunshot bangs) (telephone ringing) Hello? Yes Byron. No I don't want to talk about it now, I'll talk to you when I get to the studio. Yes, I have tried the blanks. Yeah, I think they sound real and you might say I just put a scare into an old friend of mine. I'll talk to you later. Now if you say one word about anything other than my film, I send a copy of this to the network. Blanks, Molly. Blanks. (distant siren blaring) Morris? Morris? Morris? Morris? (sharp anxious violin tones) Goddammit! Come on, you son of a bitch. (anxious electronic, violin music) - Welcome to Capital Idea, I'm Ari Povich. If the rotunda remains intact tonight, it will be something of a miracle. Our guests, two local personalities who seem to enjoy taking swipes at just about everyone in this town. My first guest, nationally-syndicated gossip columnist Diana McClellan. Nice to have you with us, Diana. - Hi Ari, good to be here. - Well of Diana it is said what Diana hears, Diana prints if it's juicy and a little later on, Roger Blackwell, the former Presidential Media Advisor who promises to raise eye-- - Blackwell stop, right there. Don't go any further. The tape. I want your copy of the tape. - You son of a bitch-- - Gimme the goddamn tape! (anxious violin tones) (gunshot booms) - Mr. Blackwell, I hope you realize we've just saved your life. - You saved my life? Is that what you said, you saved my life? What about Brodkin, did you save his life? - An unfortunate incident, Mr. Blackwell. I'm afraid my associate, shall we say, overreacted. - Shall we say overreacted? He killed a man, he killed a man! - A tragedy which we will promptly report to the authorities. - You lousy bastard, you lousy bastard, for what, for what? A lousy tape? - Okay, that's enough. - Is this all right? - That's fine. - But I really haven't finished yet. - It's fine, thank you. - Okay. - What did Brodkin say? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? - He'd dead, he was murdered. - [Byron] Holy shit, who did it, why? - The tape Byron, the tape. - What about the tape, you still gonna use it tonight? - Yes. - Great. Where's the gun? Roger, where's the gun? All right look, just do me one favor. Go through this whole thing once more before you go on. - I tell them how I got the President elected, I show them my commercials, I play them the tape. I tell them what the movie would've been about. I tell 'em how we don't get the backing. I take the gun, I put it to my head, I pull the trigger and I become a media man, all right? - [Byron] All right. Did you check the gun-- - I checked the gun. - [Byron] Well check it again. (anxious violin music) - Roger, you have had an incredible career. How many campaigns have you worked on for Richard Manning? - I did media for his two successful tries for Congress, his race for the Governor's mansion. - That was in the same state as the Congressional races. So I guess your approach was-- - Totally different. - Why was that? - Well the Congressional district was 80% rural. When he decided to run for Governor, he had to appeal to people from all over the state. That's when we had to become more sophisticated. We called in pollsters, we started pumping data into the computers. - But why didn't you just use different commercials for different parts of the state? You know, say you're for black in this part and for white in that part, so to speak. - Well if you're gonna play it that way, you have to be sure that you're off camera and that you're not gonna be quoted. You know, for times when you need a little something extra to close the deal. But on television, you have to be more devious. I'll show you what I mean. Now in this next clip, it was made four years ago when Manning was running for President and I'll let you decide for yourselves what the strategy behind it was. - [Voter] There's a man running for President that scares me, now maybe I'm wrong. A friend of mine has said to me "Listen, "just because a man sounds a little irresponsible during "the campaign doesn't mean he's gonna act irresponsibly." You know the theory, the White House makes the man. - Steve, I'm at Channel Five, where the hell is everyone? Trust me, it'll be worth it. No, not in 10 minutes, now. - [Voter] I guess what it boils down to is that I feel safe with Richard Manning and so I'm gonna vote for him and I think you should too. - Well Roger, that's out and out scare tactics with the implication the other candidate was bomb-happy. - Which of course he wasn't but we figured it was perfect for national consumption and as it turned out, we were right. - Roger, you're not saying that every elected public official in this country has misled his constituents? - No, only those that use the media. - And those who have a hired hand like you working for them. - Oh in my time, I was top of the line. Unfortunately it got me where I wanted to be. - For a time. - It was at that time that I was given the budget and I was given the power and told to go after the American people with both barrels. - Well, I understand you brought a surprise for us? - You might say that. You have the tape recorder I asked for? - Yeah, here it is. - Can we bring the boom down? What I'm about to play for you is a tape recorded conversation that took place between Richard Manning and Tony LaCorte. - You're kidding. - This tape was made two months before Manning was elected President and it's the reason that I've been under constant surveillance for the last week. - [Richard] Let's make this quick, Mr. LaCorte. My people are quite nervous about meeting alone like this. - [Tony] Sure, I can understand. You want the union's endorsement, you think I can help get it for you. - You can't? - Relax, the endorsement's yours. - As simple as that? - [Tony] Yeah, as simple as that. - [Richard] In return for? - [Tony] What makes you think I want something, especially from the next President of the United States? - [Richard] Let's quit playing games, Tony. I haven't much time. - Okay. In return for the union's endorsement, I want you to stop the crackdown on drugs in Florida. - You're crazy. - I didn't say legalize dope. I didn't say stop your law enforcement boys. Just let up a little, take the heat off. Lower their budget. (knocking) I'll be there in a second. - [Richard] Well, I'll maintain the current budget without increase for two years and change the people at the top. - [Tony] Three years and we get to pick the Director. - [Richard] Done. - That's outrageous. - The man should be impeached. Why didn't you go to the proper authorities with that tape? - Just who are the proper authorities, the people who've been following me around all week? You think the President should respond to this tape? - Of course, I think he should. - But you're not sure. - I don't know. - When I was given this tape a week ago, several members of Manning's administration encouraged me to destroy it. Others not so favorably inclined towards the President urged me to share it with the widest possible audience. They both had one thing in common. They both heard the tape, they heard the President's voice on that tape and they believed that it was real. - It's a phony? - Yes, it's a phony and as much as I would love to say that it's authentic and that's what the people who gave me the tape were hoping that I would say, it is a fake, it's a very good fake. But it's as much a hoax as the dozens of stories that find their way into the media only to be retracted or forgotten, except of course by the people whose lives are ruined by them. When I was in the White House, we would get at least three stories like this a week and of course we'd never release them unless-- - Come on Roger, are you suggesting that the White House-- - When I was thrown out three years ago, who did they get to replace me? Somebody who didn't grab power as much as they say I did? Someone who stayed in the background? No, just somebody who looked that way. Somebody who gave that impression. All they did was create a new lie, a new image with a new image maker. - Is that what your film is gonna be about? - That's the jumping off point. Look, making TV commercials is insignificant compared to the really big lies. - Well now look, if everything's as rotten and corrupt as you say it is, why didn't you make this movie years ago? - It's not exactly the kind of subject that backers find attractive. Big money is too tied into the lies. - So who's gonna back your movie? - We haven't finished rounding up our financing yet. But we'll have it after tonight. - What do you mean by that? - What you're about to see is consistent with the madness that pervades our government and our country. See not only is there an endless appetite for deception but also for violence, so I've decided to give the public exactly what it wants. Keep that camera on me, goddammit. Where the hell are you going? Get back on that camera, tell him to get on the camera. Tell him! - Give him what he wants. - I figure that the only way that I can really get my message across-- - Roger-- - Really get it across so that you never forget it, so that it sticks in your mind is to give you a full color, live, on camera honest to God image. (screaming) (gunshot booms) (anxious electronic, violin music) (motorcycle engine revving) (knocking) (tense ensemble music) I figure that the only way to get my message across so that it sticks in your mind and so that you never forget it is to give you an honest to God, live, full color image. (gunshot booms) - Jesus Christ. Roger, what have you done? - Matt, it went like gangbusters. (soft piano, violin music) - Roger. Roger, it's time to get up. I said it's time to get up, honey. ♪ Oh Roger get up, oh roger get up please ♪ ♪ Roger get up this morning Oh, forsook my love, is there no way in which this poor maiden can make thee arise? I can't see you. Thank you. A sight for sore eyes. Me, oh I've got lots of plan for today. And now, here's the news. - [Dave] I'm gonna fight for jobs and schools and decent housing but I'm gonna fight for them with dignity. - [Spokesman] Let's keep a fighter in Congress. Paid for by the Committee to Re-Elect David Lyons. - Last night shortly after the bizarre events that took place at Washington television station WTTG, Molly Grainger rushed to the scene and filed this report. - At 10:15 on Capital Idea, a show broadcast from these studios, Roger Blackwell took his own life. You may remember him as Richard Manning's first media advisor but he was also a man who had a dream, a dream to make a film about the world of politics. It is a story that begins with the anger he felt towards the abuses and the duplicity that abound in American politics, a story that begins there and then probes the torment that raged within him. In Washington, this is Molly Grainger. - In an unrelated incident, Victor Griffin, a media consultant to the White House and former CIA employee was killed in a fiery auto accident last night on Route 270 near Rockville. Unconfirmed reports indicate the 45 year old Washingtonian fell asleep at the wheel of his car. - And they call that news and I call you very late. You know, you doddle when you get dressed Roger. That's what the problem is. Although I must admit I kinda like watching your trial to decide what to wear every morning. You're just like a little boy and I know it isn't easy trying to figure out what to wear with those big, beautiful, sexy eyes of yours. But you know something sweetie, I like you in-- (anxious violin, piano music) - You look like you've seen a ghost. An expensive trick, Molly. A very expensive trick, special effects, actors, makeup but worth it because we got the money and you're invited to a press conference that we're gonna call in a couple of hours to announce my resurrection. Is this what you're looking for? Molly. Don't go back to them. - Roger, you don't understand something. They can give me what I want. - What will they want from you next time? - There's no way of telling, is there? - Well for what it's worth, I never would've used this. - Sure. (soft piano music) - Except maybe fuchsia. No really, it's a matter I've given some thought to. I think you look terrific in just about anything. I kinda like you bare-chested too when it's appropriate. So Roger listen, it does not have to be a blue shirt-- (soft anxious violin, piano music) (loud bang) - You son of a bitch. - [Reporter] Good morning, it's seven a.m. in the nation's capital and here are the top stories of the day.
