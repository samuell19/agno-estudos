YOU WERE WHITE. YOU WERE EASY. NO RED TAPE, NO QUESTIONS, NO RECORDS, CASH DEAL. - IT HAPPENS IN ENGLAND? - Whitey: IT HAPPENS ALL OVER, DARLING. BUYER'S MARKET. SHE DID THE BEST FOR YOU. DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE WENT AFTER THAT? SHE WENT OFF THE RAILS, DROWNED THE GUILT IN BOOZE, TRIED TO KILL HERSELF. DON'T BLAME HER. IT LOOKS AS IF YOU'VE TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HER SINCE? YOU KNOW WHAT? I SEE HER EVERY DAY. Announcer: Alice Dodgson, daughter of billionaire American businessman Louis Dodgson, is reported to have been abducted.
