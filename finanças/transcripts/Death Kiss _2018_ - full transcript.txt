And it happens every day. They're trafficked all over, including our back yards. But the media asks us to put our focus on other things. More rights for lazy, entitled Americans, more equality and more free stuff. They want us to spend precious court time and law enforcement resources to keep promiscuous women safe from revenge porn. The media demands that we be outraged by racism which is, by their account, the worst thing in the world. But are any of them even talking about this? About innocent children being trafficked for sex? Isn't that the worst thing? Isn't that worse than racism? Shouldn't we be worried about children's safety first? Maybe people would care more if the kidnapped children had a good online presences with clever memes on social media. Maybe hashtag nobody cares about the children because the media doesn't talk about it. You might consider me a bad guy for saying this, but until every single child on this Earth is safe, I don't care about any, I mean anything else. In the mean time, police, the people who are supposed to stop these scumbags from abducting kids, they drive right past human traffickers, drug dealers and gang members so they can give yours truly a ticket. That's right, folks. I got a ticket on my way to work this morning. I said to the officer, I said "Sir." Yes, I did call him sir. I said, "There's a house a block away from my house that's dealing drugs from their front porch." I said to the officer, "I'll take this ticket with a smile on my face, if you let me take you to this drug house. Observe the house for at least five minutes and you'll see what the rest of my neighborhood sees every single day. Then you can go in there and you can arrest them." Of course, the cop wasn't interested in doin' that. He just gave me the ticket and told me to have a nice day. I guess it's safer to give tickets to a man on his way to work with an actual job for not coming to a complete stop on a street that was totally empty... It's easier to do that than actually stop real crimes. Where does that leave us, people? [tense electronic music ♪] Who's gonna protect us? ♪ ♪ ♪ [music fades] [somber, dramatic music ♪] Hi, Mama!

Do you know what a keister bunny is? Probably not. No reason for you to know a slang term like that unless you've spent a lot of time in prison. Well, hang on to your pants there, folks, because a keister bunny is a term used for somebody who is smuggling drugs. It's a tried and true method. These low-life's either swallow baggies full of drugs or they cram them up their keisters. Yup. You heard me right. Last night at our very own municipal airport, some guy who just flew into the country was found convulsing on the floor because the baggies of drugs in his belly accidentally ruptured somehow. He was pronounced dead upon arrival to the hospital. Good riddance. Of course the police were nowhere to be found. This was just a happy accident. I did take a look at the statistics of what the police were up to last night. Seems like they did bust some kid for selling some pot. But you wanna know what the number one thing the cops were up to last night, while this guy was smuggling hard drugs right under their noses? The cops were busy answering domestic calls. Average response time, 20 minutes. Talk about arriving too late. And the cops claim to be such heroes for answering these domestic calls. They claim that they're so dangerous. But let me ask you this, my people. Who sounds more dangerous to you? Some truck driver who got drunk and smacked his wife, the waitress wife who broke a diner plate over her husband's head, or armed drug dealers? See, the cops like to pretend to be heroes. That's why they wear the uniforms and badges. But they would rather take some drunk truck driver to jail as opposed to hard criminals. The murderers. The rapist. The drug dealers. People commit crimes to get drugs. They kill each other over drugs. They kill others to get drugs. So where were the cops? Busting a bunch of jerk-off husbands and wives who got out of hand. You know, most of those couples are gonna make up the next morning. But still, the cops choose to answer those calls because it keeps them out of harm's way. They can go after the ultra- dangerous squabbling couple as opposed to dangerous criminals. Which is fine, if they wanna defend the wife from getting a black eye, but what about the women and children who are chained to beds and used as sex slaves? Are they less deserving of being rescued? How do the police ignore murderers, kidnappers and rapists in lieu of domestic violence calls? Answer the question, someone, for me! The fighting husband and wife choose each other. If the police wanna impress me, they're gonna have to go after some of the obvious criminals. Save the squabbling couple from their marital problems after you've saved women and children who are chained to beds and who are being raped by every low-life in the tri-state area.

We should all rejoice on what a great time it is to be alive. But what about those of us who still fall victim to violent crime? The police walk right past obvious-looking criminals because they claim to not have probable cause. The cops are told as we are told, not to judge people. Judge people by their looks? Sure. What if you have no other information to go on? What if it's a safety issue? It's popular to say, "No. Don't be judgmental. You can't judge a guy that looks like a criminal because what if he's the one-in-a-million guy who's turned his life around? What if you were just a normal guy like me and you're walking down a lonely street and you notice there's a lady walking in front of you? Should she judge me? I'm just some guy walkin' behind her. I'm not gonna mug her. Why be judgmental? Why judge me?" Now, if our ancestors thought that way, humans would've gone extinct, the way of the dodo bird. We would've smiled at the snakes in the grass and tried to pet it because... it's unfair to assume the snake is dangerous. It's racist to assume the snake is poisonous just because he's a snake, right? And it's not just a race thing. None of us is afraid when we get approached by a Mexican landscaper or businessman. But if we get approached by a Mexican who looks like a gangbanger, with a low rider, tattoos on his face and a hoodie. We do worry. I would. Does that make me judgmental? Sure, it means I used my best judgment. Let me tell you a little story. Not too far back, a mother was taking her baby for a little stroll. She was approached by two young African American men. They both looked like street thugs but... she didn't want to run away, she didn't wanna scream for help. She didn't want to seem like a racist who was judging people based on their appearance. One of those guys mugged her. The other shot her baby in the face. He killed her one-year-old baby by gunshot in between the eyes. Bam! True story. And the killer was spared the death penalty. Even though he killed a baby, he was only sentenced to life. A life of food and shelter by the state prison system. I guess it would have been racist of us as a society to give the death penalty to a young black man when all he did was kill a blond, white, male baby. Oh, and by the way. There were no protesters in the streets calling for justice, not for this white privileged male baby. No, sir. And what about the poor people of color who don't turn to crime? The ones who get up and go to work and make an honest living? Does the government help them? [scoffs] No. They just hit just them for taxes. But for thieves, rapists and the murderers, we give them three meals a day in an air conditioned cell with health care and dental care so that we can all feel good about ourselves for being so civilized and non-judgmental. We would save more innocent lives by publicly hanging murderers, as a matter of fact, we should sell tickets, as opposed to jailing them. Execution would be a real deterrent. Some say, we don't have the right to take a life. But by that logic, maybe we should risk more innocent lives. Put more babies at risk so that society can feel righteous about itself. Or... ...should we do the reverse? Should we do the reverse... and take matters into our own hands? An eye for an eye isn't just revenge. It helps prevent future crimes. What if- what if there was a champion for the innocent? Someone who took all of the risk to keep us safe? Someone to deliver the kiss of death to the scumbags out there? Hmm.
