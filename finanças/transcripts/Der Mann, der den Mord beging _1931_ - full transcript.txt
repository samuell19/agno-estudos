Setting: Constantinople, ca. 1912. Please, a little higher, yes? Yes. Yes, that's it. The rug in front of the desk, please. No, no, that's not right. No. The table in the corner, please. No, no. Ask them to come in, please? [Sir Edward W. Falkland, English Director of The Ottoman Administration of Sovereign Debt] [Prince Stanislaus Cernuwicz, Secretary of the Russian Embassy] Lord Falkland. Delighted. - Cernuwicz. - Delighted. If you please. - Do you smoke, my Lord? - No, thanks. - Please. - Thank you. Please excuse the unexpected visit, Marquis; we are on the way to the polo game. We are sorry we missed your first visit to the War Office. We were so eager to meet you that we just decided to drop by. Isn't that right, My Lord? - Yes. - I am delighted to meet you, gentlemen. Ah, Racine. I knew you'd be an expert in literature, Marquis. Oh, Racine! He is the first amongst poets. He is most charming, most poignant! He is of the most delightful immorality! I don't understand poetry. Don't care for it. I'm interested in coats of arms. May I see yours? A lily, isn't it? Splendid. Old family, the Sevignes. We have two bears in our coat of arms. In a golden field. There, have a look. The Falklands stood with the British monarchy for a thousand years. Thirteen of my ancestors were killed at Hamilton, 1402. 1402. I fought in the Boer War. Transvaal. By Jove! By Jove! Wretched times. - A pleasure to have met you, Marquis. - The pleasure is all mine. Well, I hope we meet again soon. - We have to talk more about Racine, yes? - It would be my pleasure. Istanbul (Judstock?) (St. Hoeur?) The Minister, please Colonel Sevigne. Am I interrupting, Your Excellency? Very kind, Your Excellency. May I ask a question? I just had visitors. Do you know Lord Falkland and Prince Cernuwicz? I'm sorry? You don't say? Be careful? Thank you, Your Excellency. I will act accordingly. I'm sorry? Tomorrow evening, at the quay? A cruise on the Bosporus? It would be my pleasure, Your Excellency. Over there is Anadolu Hisar, the Asian castle of Mehmed Fathi. The palace for the Sultan's guests. Dolmabahce, palace of the Sultan. Who is this woman? The woman? Believe it or not, that's Lady Falkland. Really? This woman and that bulldog? She was 18, maybe 17 years old, when her family married her to the Lord. Did you have a good look around Constantinople, Colonel? - Yes, Your Excellency. I'm starting to love the city. - That's nice. Have a good look around, you won't have the chance for much longer. The country is kaput. - What's this? - Ox muzzle salad, Your Excellency. Ox muzzle salad? Bit heavy, yes? (?) Turkey. A little lobster mayonnaise, yes. Government debts, loans, tobacco monopoly. Little of that, too. Pray, what is left? The country is kaput. The conversions, the ceded public revenue... - Good evening, ambassador. - Good evening, Madam. - How do you do? - Hah, how do you think? - It's the stomach, always the stomach. - Oh. May I present Marquis Sevigne. Our new constructor for the Turkish army. Baron Kerloff and wife. - Why don't you consult with Prof. Ishan? - Who? - Prof. Ishan. - Bah, physicians. They know nothing. You are from Paris, Marquis? You must find it incredibly tedious here. Not quite, Baroness. There are so many beautiful women. - Ah, a compliment? - Why, no, Lady Kerlock. - We'll catch up later. - Goodbye. -Au revoir. Ah, Marquis! Good evening, Lord Falkland. Good evening, Marquis. May I beg the honour of being introduced to your wife? Mary? Marquis de Sevigne. My friend. Marquis de Sevigne? Lady Poole, Madame de Boncourt. - Please, Marquis, take a seat. - Thank you, my lady. - I've already had the pleasure of seeing you. - Really? Where? In a barque on the Bosporus, with a multi-coloured parasol. There was a... gentleman with you. A gentleman? Oh, you mean Georgie! You see, Marquis, she is a very affectionate mother. She takes him with her wherever she goes. - Truly, a charming young fellow. - She spoils him very much, our little Lady. Do you know what his latest trick is? He doesn't say "Mama" anymore. He calls me "Mary" now. For example: "Mary, we are going boating." "Mary, wear the green dress, you'll be beautiful." - Lovely! - Like a true gentleman. [Good evening] [Good evening, My Lord] Brilliant! We've been dancing for two hours. - Three orchestras, one takes a break, you dance to the next. - Yes. - How long have you been married? - Eight days, Madam. [There's nothing like a happy marriage!] [Tell me, children, how old are you together? 38 at most?] [-No, thirty-nine, Madam! - Thirty-nine, oh...] [-We waltzed together, everyone was watching. - They formed a circle around us!] [-Tomorrow, we'll visit Cairo. - And take photos with the pyramids!] [-We just came out for a breather. - Yes, let's go back!] - My dear lady? - Yes? - May I take my leave of you? - Yes. May I ask permission to call on you at home? You must have a... day for visitors? I don't have a day for visitors. But I am seldom out, Marquis. [Mary!] [Mary!] Good evening, Marquis, and goodbye. Yes, my dear, I'll take you home. Lord Edward and the Prince are staying. You've been drinking again, Stani. You should be ashamed of yourself. Not that much, my lady. Don't be angry with me, hm? - May I? - Please. - Waiter! Heidsieck Monopole! - Please, Edward, not that terrible Heidsieck. The Marquis is French. Garcon, Pommery Grenot brut. Marquis, I've something funny to tell you. You know the Russian, Donievski? Oh, you don't know him? You don't know him. - Garcon, Pommery? - Yes, Your Highness. They have a new vodka, it's midnight, they're naked, and they're drunk. And the wife says it's not vodka, but whisky. It was vodka, of course. First, Donievski laughs, but then he gets mad, really mad. He takes the dog whip, and the woman, totally naked, jumps out of the window. And the most hilarious thing? Next morning, they couldn't remember a thing! And it actually was whisky! Hello, waiter! Heidsieck Monopole! Edward, that's sheer madness. Garcon! No Heidsieck. Pommery Grenot brut! Marquis, there's something I wanted to ask you. - You already have a little girlfriend, surely? - You are mistaken, my lord. Ah, you're a gentleman. Never admit anything. Not because of the girlfriend, no. But because of the women... [I'm sorry, Your Highness; the wine cellars are closed after 1 o'clock.] - What? What did you just say? - I'm sorry, Your Highness, the cellars are... You... whore pisser! Bring me what I ordered! Didn't I order champagne? Pommery Grenot brut! At once! You swine! - Good evening, gentlemen. - Evening. Hello? Good afternoon, sir. It's a pleasure to meet you. - My cousin has told me a lot about you. - I'm sorry, who? - Lord Falkland is my cousin. - I see. [Practise without me for a moment, Georgie. I'm just going to...] Oh, Mr. Sevigne. What a pleasant surprise! - Why wasn't he announced? - I don't know. They must've forgotten. - You are English, Madam? - Yes, I was born in Scotland. But you are not English, my dear lady? Me? No, far from it. I am anything you like, Spanish, French, Creole. I was born in Havana. That's what I thought. The eyes, the hair... - But your name is Mary, isn't it? - Marie, Maria. My husband couldn't pronounce it the way I like. Yes, my cousin loves everything English. His son is to become a true Englishman. My dear lady, I have a small request. Ask the young gentleman to join us, please? - Really? Would that please you? - Yes, very much. [Come in, Georgie. Say hello to the gentleman.] Go on. - Good afternoon, my boy. - Bow to the gentleman, Georgie. - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! - What's your name, my boy? - I am George. - What do you want to do when you grow up? - I want to sell sweets. - Really? But why, Georgie? - Because they shout a lot. - I see. No other reason? - I'm not telling. Because you can eat sweets all day. - Come on, silly. We're having tea now. - Yes. Come here, little one. It's your husband, Mary. [Quiet!] [Go!] My dear lady? Please excuse my frankness, but you have a very vigilant... guard. Would it perhaps be possible... for us to talk alone for an hour or two? I have so many questions, for your ears alone. It is not easy, but let's think about it. - Would you like a tour of Stambul? - That would be lovely. - Monday? - Where? - First street on the right after the old bridge; I'll be there at four. - Thank you. An incredible ride! A, my lady, pardon. Ali! How are you, my lady? I haven't seen you in three days! First time in my home, Colonel. I'm delighted. - Well. Anything happened? - No, Edward, nothing happened. - Yes? - I want something. - What do you want? - I want something. - What do you want, Georgie? - Chocolate. You want chocolate? George! Come here! It's rude to lower your voice. Understood? You'll be punished. Leave. Don't scold the child, Edward. You know Mary doesn't like a tough upbringing. I hope you'll never tolerate manners in him that aren't those of a gentleman, Edith. I believe leniency fosters pride and courage in children. I don't like seeing the expression of a whipped dog on a child's face. Our opinions on child-rearing diverge. But that doesn't matter. My wife and I disagree on the matter as well. But that doesn't matter. Please, gentlemen. Please excuse me, I am on duty. Goodbye, Marquis. We'll see you out, won't we, Edith? - Yes, of course. - Thank you. - Am I late? You didn't have to wait too long? - By no means, my lady. - We're going to see Stambul now? - Yes, of course. Why do you allow them to treat you like this? Why don't you get a divorce? I don't want to lose my child. But nobody can take your child; you are in the right. In the right? You don't know Lord Falkland. Georgie is his only son and heir; you don't know what that means to him. He is powerful. If I get a divorce, he'll arrange to get custody. - But... - Please, don't. I know the Orient. We're not in France. There is also something else. Please, come with me. For the (shish?), for the library, and flowers for the table.. Anything happened? Mary! Mary! Georgie! Georgie, dear sweet Georgie. - Did you miss Mama terribly? - Yes. - What did you do all afternoon? - I was playing. - With the big wooden horse, or the trains? - Both. With both? You must've been busy. Come, Mama has to change now. - And the second coach nearly... - Broke? - Yes. I needed the fire brigade. - The fire brigade? - Is everything all right now? - Yes. Help Mama choose a dress for the evening. Georgie, calm down! - This one, mummy! The green one. - Yes, silly. But why the green one? Mary! But Georgie, What are you doing with my hat? Don't destroy Mama's clothes, little one. - If you behave, you can have dinner with us. - Oh yes! Now go play, go on! Georgie, stop that awful racket! I won't have any of it. George! - Be quiet, you rascal, you... - You hit the child! Let go of him! Let go right now! Perfume! Ali! I can't take it any longer! I demand that Edith leave this house at once. - Why? - She hit the child! Ali! Ask Lady Edith to come in, please. Please. Yes, Edward? You asked for me? Well? Well? What happened? Nothing to speak of, Edward. You know Mary. - You hit George? - Hit? Good heavens, I just cuffed him gently. - Well? - It's not true! She hit the child, just because he was happy. - Please, control youself! - I controlled myself long enough, never said anything. - If you don't like it, just leave. - But not without Georgie. Right. So he grows into a limp sissy, with your education methods? I don't have the time for this. Good evening. Edward, I wanted to ask... - Heidsieck Monopole! Red. - All right, Heidsieck Monopole, red. It must've been a lucky star that guided you here today. - You have to come with us, it's all hands on deck. - I'm sorry, I'm already... - Who is it? - Please, don't trouble yourselves... I see... he has to stay especially faithful because he is married, yes? - Are you coming with us, Lord Edward? - Of course, old chum, of course. Very well, gentlemen, I'm coming with you. - Well, what do you say, Marquis? - Excellent. Open, please. - Bonsoir, Messieurs! - Bonsoir, Madame! Mademoiselle. (French) Did you get the results from Longchamp? I bet 200 Francs on Carabine. (French) Once, I lost 500 Francs on Pergolaise. Good horse, Pergolaise, good horse. - We didn't come here for the horses. - But of course. - Heidsieck Monopole? - Yes. [Well.] [Hurry, Mesdames, hurry!] [Come on, don't push] (French) May I present... [Hm, delightful.] Charming, eh? Lovely! And you, Yvette. Wonderful! - Ah, new! Where are you from, Belgrad? - Agram! -That's what I thought. - Bonsoir, Madame. - Bonsoir, Monsieur. (French)-How are you? - So-so. - You're well-known here, Lord Edward? - Yes. - Nothing strikes your fancy today? - No. Don't be afraid, little one... How do you like this part, my little bacchante? I've been watching him in his home, with his mistress, and in the brothel. He has influence; the local authorities fear him. But there has to be a way to help the lady. Or shall we just just watch as he destroys the lady? Well, Your Excellency? My dear Colonel, you speak like a true gentleman. But Lord Falkland is a force to be reckoned with. I warned you before, don't get involved with him. Hello? Yes. I'm sorry, who? Yes... Yes. - It's for you, Colonel. - Thank you. Please, don't get up, Your Excellency. Colonel Sevigne speaking? Oh, my lady. Good afternoon. My lady, how did you know... My servant told you? Yes, he knew I was with His Excellency. I see. Of course. At five o'clock? At six? Goodbye. - I'm sorry, Your Excellency. - Please. Well. I thank you for your frankness, Your Excellency. I... I thank you. You're welcome. I'm warning you. [No, put it over there. That's all right, I'll arrange it.] Mary, is it true? You'll no longer live in the house? Thank you for coming. I was thinking if I should ask you, but I trust you. Yesterday, when we met, I still thought I had rights in my own home. Edith hit the child, and I was helpless. For the first time, I realized the miserable position I'm in. I can't even protect my own child. I can't live with these people any longer. What should I do? I can't go because of Georgie. I moved to a pavilion in the garden. But I must do something. But I don't believe I'm strong enough anymore. - And what will happen to Georgie, my little... - Please, my lady, calm yourself. Nothing will happen to you as long as I am here. I give you my word. Please, believe me. I... I do love you. - For God's sake, you don't know... - Mary. Please tell me, what plagues you still? Cernuwicz! No! - Where to? - Just outside. Stop. Leave, leave! How dare you come here? Ali, Achmed! The dogs to the exits. Stay! Open up! Open up or I'll break down the door. What happened? You were screaming. Well, well. Mr. Cernuwicz. With my wife. At two in the morning. Alone. - Very delighted, Mr. Cernuwicz. - You have no right to laugh like this, Edward. - You have no right, I forbid it... - What do you forbid? What? Because you're not in bed together? I wasn't born yesterday. Chum. There! What... what's this? Sit down over there, please. All right. Write. Declaration: Ah, thank you. I confess to have broken my marriage vows with Prince Stanislaus Cernuwicz. How can you say that, Lord Edward? I was the one breaking in, nothing happened. - Did you get "...broken my marriage vows"? - Yes, "broken my marriage vows". You're telling me you broke in here without any claim? - I swear on... - Yes, it's true, I have broken my vows. There. I couldn't take any more of your behaviour. I was so alone. I thought the Prince would be my friend, my protector. ...broken my marriage vows. I will not resist a divorce, And I agree to give up my rights to my son George Edward Falkland. No! Stambul. 11 October 1912 Declaration. I confess to have broken my marriage vows with Prince Stanislaus Wassiljovoitsch Cernuwicz! I will not resist a divorce, and I agree to give up my rights to my son, Georg Edward Falkland. Maria Falkland Hat. Gloves. Give me that. - Ali! Which one of the horses is saddled? - Emir, my lord. Good. That's settled. It's seven now. If something happens, I'm with my lawyer from nine til ten. I expect you for tea at five. - Good morning. - Edward! What is it? - Stop! - Let me through! You don't want to? Go to hell! Let me pass. Let me pass! Lord Falkland murdered! Holdup or political crime? The Director of the Ottoman Administration of Sovereign Debt was murdered this morning. The investigation is ongoing. [-New cards, please. - Your bets, please] [-Shuffle, please. - Hand me that, please.] - Who is leading the investigation? - The Turkish administration. - Not the English? - No. [-Your bets, gentlemen. - Shuffle, please.] [-Your bets, please. No more bets! - Here we go.] No need to get upset. He wasn't very popular, Lord Falkland, was he? - Maybe I shouldn't talk like that. - Maybe you should. Give me the scarf. Terrible draught in here. Wretched country, all the extreme temperatures. Boisterous fellow, Lord Falkland. - I'm betting. - I'm sorry, the game is closed. - Naturally. - I'm sorry. - What is your bet, Your Excellency? - Ten Francs. If you please. Good evening, Colonel. - Good to see you, I was looking for you. - (?) Please. - I wanted to talk to you about Falkland. - Please. Well, the Falkland case... The Lady is free now, but it doesn't look good for her. - Lady Edith accuses her of instigating Cernuwicz. - But that's sheer madness! Madness or not, if this goes to court, many things will come to light. Lady Mary's relations with Lord Cernuwicz, among others. And whatever the outcome, Lady Mary would be compromised. If Cernuwicz was guilty. But imagine if Cernuwicz is innocent. What if the murderer were a witness to the conflict between Lady Falkland and her husband? A man who saw what was right, a man who sided with the weaker party of his own free will. Imagine if he witnessed Lord Falkland forcing Lady Mary to give up her child. He confronts him, wants him to change his plan. Falkland shoots, they fight, he falls. The man bends over the body, and takes out the red portfolio with the fatal document. It's foggy, nobody saw him. He destroys the document. He keeps the portfolio, as proof of what he has done. You have a strange imagination, Colonel. Maybe you're right, and Cernuwicz is innocent. I can't force you to turn in your unknown man. But there is a higher justice, that judges differently than ours here on earth. Your unknown man will have to justify what he did before his conscience. And you will leave Constantinople, Colonel. Our beautiful city wasn't right for you. Mylady, I have the honour to bid you farewell. I am leaving Stambul. I take this opportunity to thank you. Your most devoted servant, de Sevigne.
