Europa Film presents The Baby Carriage A film by Bo Widerberg Cinematography Music Sound Editing Going to the park again? No, I'm just waking by myself. I always walk by myself. Not now. What about your train home? Cool it. It's just the night watchman. He's on his way to work. He just woke up. Strange, isn't it? - Good morning. - Morning. What do you think of the weather today, Mr Persson? Oh, what a day! What do when half the factory want the windows open and half want them closed? One minute you're sweating like a pig, the next freezing to death. If only they could air the place out every hour and otherwise keep them closed. But you can't make them all stop arguing, unless someone tells them off. Isn't that up to Brenn? Brenn? Ha! Well... He's good at a lot of things, but not keeping women in place. Even in the event that you believe everything to be going your way and that fortune is on your side, you must be wary of going too far. The trick is to-- --and because of which, be delayed. Heed an older person's sound advice. All is fair in love and war. And you will most likely go on a short journey. Hooray. So I might get to take the tram to work? - Was that it? - Yes, for today. Hey. Strange that the weeklies don't come every day. Are you happy about moving? Of course. I've dreamt about it for years. But the rent is gruesome, right? That means you can't quit working. Of course not. To quit working is out of the question. Not yet, anyway. What do you know? Someone's... - Someone's put gum in the keyhole. - People sure do strange things. It's probably the Russians. Maybe I can use something to pick it out. Could I borrow a hairpin to try and pick it out with? Give me the key and I'll help you. There you go. The gum is probably somewhere else. Are you saying I've chewed one gum too many? Now that I can't get in, can't I follow you a bit? Look! Look! There it comes! Hide, damn it! Come in under my coat. - What are you doing? - Protecting myself. Because I... Because the air is dangerous, you know. Who the hell dares to breathe nowadays? Look! Look! There's another one. Bah, you seem nuts. I'm nuts? So I'm the one who's nuts. Hey! I was just kidding. You don't talk much. It's bad. You have to talk. It's the most important thing you can do. To talk! They're building churches! There are homeless people out there and they have the nerve to build churches! I actually don't live there, back there... ...where we met. I just don't want to be at home. My mother doesn't know. She's having a party at home. Damn it, it's like I can't stand seeing her cackling and having fun. Say something, then. Maybe you can't speak? Or is it good manners, not to open your mouth? You shouldn't play tough. You should be curious. Otherwise you'll never learn anything. Look! Here you can buy...hearts. - Of ink. - You can? - When I've tried I-- - Only if you're lucky! Lucky! Do you have ten ?re? - What's your name? - Larsson. - What else? - Britt. Britt Larsson! Britt Larsson will get a heart. Nothing. So you can talk after all. We should see each other again and talk some more. On Sunday. Wesle's Corner. Should we say so? Eight o' clock. Wesle's Corner. On Sunday. Come on! There's a sale at Moses'! Can't afford it. I haven't paid for that coat yet. Are you nuts? Italian jumpers for 119.50. Italian! I'll lend you ten. Staffan! Where on earth did Staffan go? No, the other way! Aren't you hungry? Yes. A little. There was a hole in the net, so I've got to fix it. Because of the cat. Are you mad? No. But my feet really hurt. Heya! Haven't I seen you before? - As if! - No, I believe we have. Where was that? The Pamarant bar? - Didn't I see you in the caf?? - Too bad you already have a date. So what do you think? A much bigger screen, huh? Not just 21''. What do you think? Oh my-- Move over, let me see. Here's the warranty slip. Channel selector, input line and high voltage selector. And it's controlled remotely! You can put the machine on and then maneuvre it from the couch. - Well I-- - It's true. Will it show images? Get it running, will you? What do you do? I fiddle with all kinds of things. Like, you know... Fiddle around, you know... - And you? What do you do? - Me? I'm a mannequin. Where are we going? You'll see. Answer me. Where are we going? You're one of those who wants to decide for themselves. Why didn't you say so? I just wanted to show you where I sometimes go and practice at night. Practice? Practice what? Look in the back. I've got a place around here where no-one can bother me. Soon I will get into - as soon as I can get a foot in the door - into the rhythm business. Now that's a business. The rhythm business. Take this piece. It's stiff as a carcass. Now imagine adding some rhythm. Yes, rhythm is the way to go now. Rhythm is what we need. Well, here we are. This is where I come to practice. Listen. To what? Don't you hear it? What am I supposed to hear? Don't you hear how quiet it is? What's that to listen to? You can't even hear it. It's so quiet that my ears are almost ringing. I think it's scary. I go crazy when it's this quiet. Christ, if it's this quiet out in the sticks I understand why people go to town. Nothing to talk to but chickens. I mean, I like eggs but... Do you think this is what the foreigners call Swedish sinfulness? Oh shit! I have to be at work at seven. Give me my shirt, will you? You'll have to get off here. You can't follow me further. Shit! I almost forgot this, too. Hey - I'll call you some time. Bye. Hey, that's just great. Now all I need is a telephone. What was it like to have a bun in the oven? My folks went mad at first. But when they started to apply for an underage wedding permit, they calmed down. - I mean how did you feel? - Like total shit. - Where? - All over. Was it like you wanted to throw up but couldn't? So. That's what it is. I'm pregnant. What the hell am I supposed to do? Happens to everyone sooner or later. But you always think it won't happen to you. What am I supposed to do? It will work out if you just leave it be. That's what I did. Just wait. And then your life will be about nappies and pacifiers. I heard you had an accident, honey. How long is it gone? Too long. A month. Just a month? Then you can still fix it. Do you know who? Don't you girls ever protect yourselves? My diaphragm was in my other coat... I'll give you the address of someone. Chin up, honey. You're not the first. Do you want that address? I don't know. Are you joining? No, I'll take the day off. Will you just go home? No... You're not doing anything bad, are you? Don't worry. I'm just going to look at the pelican. Mom, can I talk to you for a minute? Mom, can I tell you something? I have some troubles. You can take five kronor from my wallet. Return it Friday. Is that good psychology? Do what I say, Britt. This time I decide. I didn't ask for money! It's not money I need! Go ahead, have a seat. What did you think? I've spiced up our number a bit. Improved the rhythm. Gave it a little more go. - What did you think? - It was very nice. You sure are popular now. I'm not complaining. Three joints per night. I can't drive to more than three. Maybe I should ask for an autograph. How have you been? Fine, thanks. I've been getting rounder and rounder. You knocked me up, you see. We have to fix this, you have to handle this. That we're going steady. All hell's gonna break loose if they found out I lied. You have to find somewhere we can live. Understand? Mom, will the war come? Will the war come? - What do I know? - But do people buy a lot of art? Have you sold many small, expensive oil paintings lately? When small, light, expensive things start to switch owners more and more, the bells will soon start ringing. Why don't you start collecting stamps instead? They're too sticky for my taste. - How is Sten? - How are you? Good, thank you. Do you still hang with that bunch of loafers? They're not loafers. They just don't need all 24 hours for making a living. It's strange that you live here in Sweden and not in Paris, like dad. What should I do in Paris? Plus, your dad is there. Out of the question. Paris would suit you. It's a tiara! But to be in Sweden... a fur hat with the fur full of moths. A fur full of moths, perhaps. But no vermin, no lice. It's ridiculous, mom. Don't you get it? To be young in Sweden now. Sweden isn't ridiculous. The old neutral democracies are the only ones that will remain. It's people like you that ruin it all. You scream till you're sore because you can't find a single injustice anywhere. And don't you go Communist to solve the problem of boredom. Or you'll have to sleep in the outhouse. Sure, if you join the NRA. Are you still working with that? Do you know how it feels to be surrounded by beautiful objects all day and not be able to make as much as a pisspot yourself? You asked why I'm still together with Sten. Do you want to know why? He can make me put those goddamn pieces of wood away for a minute. Maybe I can too. But you never asked me to. There. Now you don't have to think about that anymore. Are you still in bed? Spit out the pillow so I can hear you. I don't feel well. My stomach hurts. I don't know what it is... an ulcer, ileus or something. I heard about someone having intestinal spasms. Maybe it's that. If it hurts anywhere, go and see a doctor. So I guess you haven't been to look for an apartment today. It's already been a month since we last looked. If we're not emergency cases, I don't know what is. Whine, whine, whine. You'll have to do without potatoes then. I'm too tired to go. Look what happened to the bed. Now that's what I call love. Don't you want to get up to eat? Shit, that's completely shorched. Looks like car fuel during wartime. I'm too tired. I'll call in sick tomorrow. You can't stop working in the night as well. It's not the end of the world. They can do it without me. It's just some place far out in the sticks. - Mom? - Yes? It's not what you think. I didn't know him before it happened. I just couldn't say anything back then. You were so nice to me. I wonder what dad would have thought about it. He would have kicked us both out. And then... when I was going to tell him about it... You should've seen me, mom! I, who had never begged for anything in life before, begging him. Can't you let me move back home, mom? But your child needs a father, Britt. Don't you want him to have a father? As far as I can tell, he has a father. What about when he starts school? He won't even have a last name this way. What's wrong with Larsson? It's worked for me for eighteen years. Marriage isn't what you think it is. Time fixes it. The first part is worst, but then you get used to it. How do you it's been for me? Huh? You know your father. Do you have any idea how often I've thought about-- Well. What's that got to do with me? No, Britt. I just meant that you can't always expect it to be grand. Grand? It's for my entirely life, mom! What happened to that flat you talked about? We had to break up. It's cruel to send a guy from the south all the way to Boden. That's above the Arctic circle, isn't it? So is the flat free now? Yes, I'm thinking of subletting, but you know how people feel about that. Job Opportunities The Glass I've... - I've been looking for you. - You have? I couldn't meet you that Sunday because I had an exam the day after, and then and then I got a bit mad because you didn't wait for me at that machine where I was going to withdraw that...or I should-- You don't have to explain yourself. I didn't go either. I didn't even remember where it was. And then I saw the announcement about you in the newspaper. Are you married yet? Look at my strange shoes. Are you happy? Are you happy working in the store? Yes, of course. Better than any other job I've had. They usually just tell you what to do, and you do it... The only thing you have to figure out yourself is where you can go and take a puff. At least now I have to keep a lot of things in mind. You don't talk a lot. - No... - It suits you. Not much gets said, though. Nope. I'm not getting married. I'm having a child. That's all. - Can I see you some time? - I've gotta run now. - Can I see you some time? - I've gotta scram now. - But can I see you? - I've gotta scram. Where? Same place. - 10 o' clock. - 10 o' clock. - And then the entire day. - And then the entire day. - Good bye. - Bye. And then... And then I quit, you know. It was stupid, of course, because if you want to keep studying you need your diploma, but I couldn't sit still, you know. You always have to try things. New things. You have to be curious. How... How is Robert doing? It's over. - Maybe you don't want to talk about it. - No. ???? "fan sp? sig"? Can I give you something? Is this better or worse? - Now it's better. - I see. Which ones do you like? Public library Let's just play side B. How much does it cost? - No, not... - What? - It doesn't cost anything. - Good. 'Cause, you know, when we used to sit and listen in the record stores... We were always broke, and always got nervous when they came and asked us to buy something. I remember those damp cubicles they had as well. And we never bought anything, you know. Do you like it? The music? Sure. Do you like it? No, not really. Do you? - Yes. - You do? Now it sounds better. Do you think so? Better than before. - Don't you think so? - Yes. A little, anyway. You know... Once... Robban was the kind of guy that started doing one thing but just couldn't finish it, you know? Do you know what I mean? - He couldn't... - How do you mean? - Quit it. - Just give me an example. When the bed broke it could just stand there for three months. He was like that. I understand. - It's so hard... - But I understand. - Huh? - No, nothing. Do you want to leave? No. Do you? - Then let's stay. - Yes, let's stay. What did you say was the name of the guy who wrote it? Vivaldi. Do you think there are pelicans at the zoo here? [Danish word for zoo] Do you think he's related to the one at home? - Who? - The pelican! They have the same mouth... Do you know what he looks like? A stork with the mumps. He's kicking! He's kicking! Hey, Bj?rn... I'm so glad that I didn't get married. And how does a pelikan walk? An elephant! It's from Stockholm. When you ran away from home, how long were you gone? Ten days. It was in winter. I almost froze my butt off. - Did they go to the police? - No, daddy didn't want to. Afraid of a scandal. I was glad they didn't back then. Now I don't know. That thing is Staffan's, my little brother. Look at this. I think the coffee is ready. Do you think there's a bakery nearby? When you exit the house turn right and turn into the first street on your left. First lef-- first right? - First right. - And then left. What do I really have? Taste. What good is taste? No, what I really need is... is courage. The reason I hate those people that come and go in my house that have come and gone all my life is that they are the kind of people that can make right things that are wrong. They are influential. And spend all their time bullshitting around at parties. Know what I mean? Yes, I have a father too. He has the exact same taste as my mother when it comes to paintings. But it was the only thing they agreed on. When I grew up it was like there was a very loud radio, always on. Refined... Yes sir. My mother is a very refined person. But there are so many other things that need to be done. All that smells, all that's boring. I don't think that someone who has never changed her kid's diapers really knows her child. - Fourty-one? - Yes, here. - What would you like? - Two steaks, please. Here are two thin ones. Minute steaks. I want thicker ones - What? - Do you want Tornedos? No, just chops. What's the matter? Are you drunk? What's the matter, Bj?rn? If only she hadn't already promised... It's mom. She's going to go away with that fucking scumbag. Maybe she loves him. - She can't help it if she loves him. - That's impossible! She has taste! Oh, but look at...you've made such a wonderful dinner. I'm sorry. You know, some days I feel so down that not even the pelicans look funny. I got it from my aunt Ella. She always said I should have one. But boy is it heavy! I brought a bottle of wine! Damnit, I seem to forget everything today. Close your eyes. Now look! They suit you. These are not horrifically uncomfortable. You have to see well now so you don't trip, now that you carry such a precious stomach. That must be Nina crying. She lives upstairs. Her mom works nights as a cleaner. Should we go up and look after her? Come here. Come, honey... Is mommy away? Oh, honey... - There? - Yes, there. Should I hit here? Now you go. Good going. - You go! - My turn again? What about aunt Britt? No, don't pick it up. Just hit it, it's okay. Aunt Britt will hit. My turn. Will you go get it, Nina? Who are you writing to? Nina, who are you writing to? Daddy! I'm hitting! Show us how you write to daddy. Do you want Nils to write? Show me how you write to daddy. I don't know how to. But nothing is happening. Maybe you have to use the hammer. - Isn't it time for bed, Nina? - No! Do you think she's asleep? - Britt happy? - Yes, Britt happy. - I'll see you... - Thursday. - Bye. - Bye. What's the matter, Bj?rn? What's the matter? When I got home... - Mom... - What happened? And him, that guy... They didn't even bother closing the door. What happened? I'll show you what happened. You'll kill the baby! You were supposed to help me! I wanted to help you all along, but I have to decide for myself. Why did you have to ruin everything? Why couldn't you have waited? From what you've told me I didn't think your guys had to wait very long. It depends on who it is. What would we have talked about afterwards? There is an afterwards too. But your kind is only good for one thing. Not with you. With you I wouldn't be able to. Why not with me? Why not? Because you see it as something ugly. Do you know what I mean? You think it's shameful. No I don't! It's only ugly when it's with your kind. You... You cheap fucking whore! Not too hard. Now push...and relax. Once more now. A little more. Good! Don't push anymore now. Keep going. Good. Here comes the head. You're doing great. Push more, just a little more. Good work. I can see the shoulders. You're done. Don't you think it's best if you move back to us now? Thank you, but I'm too used to making it on my own. Is it our fault? Is it because of us it has come to this? No. No. It's nobody's fault. When things go bad, it's not always somebody's fault. I'll trip now and then, that's all. This wasn't in my horoscope. None of it was. Flight to Paris boarding now. Hi. Hi there. Can I come in and see it? I think she has my nose. Yeah, maybe. But everything else comes from me. I'm her father, aren't I? Yes, you added a few drops. Hey Robban - I'm sorry. I was on a tour when you... I meant to visit you. Thanks for the flowers, by the way. What's this? It's ointment. Is it for when she wets herself? - Is it good? - Yes. So how's it going for you? Well, it's going good. I've quit singing rock and sing more slow things now. I bet you didn't expect that - me singing slow songs. I still have the rhythm, of course. Remember? Can't let that go. One journalist even thought I had matured. But maybe still hasn't matured enough for marriage. No, Robban. I don't think that would work out. No, I don't think it would work. Not even if you started singing Christmas carols. I'm glad you're making money, though. Then we could have some more alimony. Kids cost a lot. I should be going. No, stay. Thank you. Did you thank me? It was just like you were somewhere else all the time. I was gone for a while. Just a little while. I'm here now. You can't stay here. But I want you to come over from time to time. Stop crying! I can get that one.
