…fearsome thief… idolises Dillinger, the American gangster of the 1930s… Dillinger's latest exploit… Dillinger robbed a bank on the Champs-Elysées at 3 p.m. Dillinger hold-up… Incredibly bold gangster… Dillinger… Incredibly bold gangster… Dillinger… Dillinger… Dillinger… …special… Pseudo-Dillinger… Inspector Kramer declares war on gangsters. War on gangs. Incredibly bold gangster… Dillinger… Dillinger hold-up on the Champs-Elysées… Incredibly bold gangster… Dillinger… …special on… gang leader pseudo-Dillinger. Inspector Kramer declares war on gangs. Incredibly bold gangster… There he is, let's go! Inspector Kramer, please, would you like to make a statement for TV? -Any new clues? -Inspector, a photo? Any new clues Inspector? Please. -Is he hiding in Paris? -Be nice. Inspector Kramer, you don't mind looking ridiculous? Inspector! Inspector Kramer, was the pseudo-Dillinqer your childhood friend? Yes. You can go in now, Sir. Don't move. …left in a police car. -That way? -Yes, that way. Got the diamonds? Yes. You got the money? Don't touch. Don't try anything! Albert! The diamonds have fallen into the vat. -Take him, I'll go. -Are you mad? Albert! The second one. -Where's Al? -Getting the rocks. In the car! God, what's he doing! Shit, the cops! Let's go! It's stopped bleeding. I was afraid it was an artery. Don't say I'm hurting you! I've performed miracles with these gentle hands. As a healer? No, as a pick-pocket! Now I understand. My speciality was ladies' handbags. I was always humane, mind! The little maid out and about, no. But the broads with the expensive coats? I was so skilful with them! You're less skilful at bandaging. I could have nicked a cop's socks without taking his shoes off. Shut up you two! You scared me! The bastards! They almost had us. I waited for the cops to go. I wanted to recover the diamonds. Impossible. Lost! Somebody will do alright out of it. POLICE - ANTI-GANG SQUAD There was a big one and a small one. The small one had a Salvador Dalí moustache. Was the getaway car an ID or a DS? A black DS. I'm sure. -Sure? -I'm sure! Thanks. OK. At last. What is it? Pâté. You know I don't like pâté. Still fussy? Last orders gentlemen. I asked for two sandwiches. Yes, hello? I'll see if he's still here. -Boss. -Yes? -Someone from the Interior Ministry. -Tell them I've left! Sorry, he's left. Yes? -I'll be in "The Village". -OK. Can I take your order? Three Village steaks. -And after? -For dessert? An orange sorbet. A crème caramel. A crème caramel. And you Sir? -Just a coffee. -And a coffee. Thank you. -Have you decided? -The usual. -OK. -And quickly, I'm in a rush. As usual. And for dessert? I'll wait until you're free. When you've arrested Dillinger. We'll be waiting a while. Funny, I never know when you are being serious. Hence my charm. Hello sheriff! Is that you? You've wrecked my rearview mirror. Wait, don't turn around, I'll be forced to shoot you! Happy to see me? -Would you believe me if I said yes? -Of course. -Can I smoke? -No, don't move. -I'll light you one. -You don't trust me? Never trust a cop. So, looking for somewhere quiet for a secret smoke. Oh no, don't try that sentimental trick. You're already in all my childhood memories! In class, the playground, the carousels, even catechism! -How's your mother? -Good. -She still in Lisieux? -Here we go! Turning a friendly chat into an interrogation. She must be proud of her criminal son. We need crooks, you idiot. They provide jobs to loads of people, like you. -I employ lots of people. -Including undertakers. Everyone's trying to put me away, but I'm still here. Justice is a beautiful thing! -Was that what you came to tell me? -No. I didn't want my good friend the sheriff to look like a fool. "Dillinger, the Killer with a Heart", nice headline. Enough with the irony! Here's the address for the diamonds. Thank you. An accomplice wouldn't say more. Why this gift? Let's say friendship. I'm going now. You go straight ahead. Don't try and arrest or find me. -I can give you my word for today. -A cop's word? It's rare, but it exists. Cops are like finger prints. No two are the same. Goodbye, sheriff. …time to dine. He didn't want this case, so there's no rush. -Why? -As if you don't know! He's looking for him, but prays that he doesn't find him! I've finished praying! I'll wait for you downstairs. Do you feel better? I've got a fever. I'll use it, it helps with the writing. -Ah… -It's great. Separated by 30 years, your lives are almost the same. Of course, I've been trying to be like him since I was a kid. But you're not like him! What do you mean I'm not like him? No, not at all! Have you read it? OK, there's the planning of the jobs. The difference is, he did them in New York and Chicago, and you do them here. But as far as ideas go… you're the stronger. I say so, here. Oh, right. You know, in life, it's a matter of choice. What do you mean? Oh nothing, I was thinking about death. It's true! We can die at any time, and we don't care. Others prepare for death all their lives, that's why they're unhappy. Can I write that, to end my chapter? Don't forget it! You sure it works? Relax: a bit of gas and they'll be asleep for a few minutes. Like they're closed. EUROPEAN BANK OF CREDIT Let's go. You're crazy! Well done! He put you lot to sleep too. It's not me saying that, it's the press! We went as fast as we could. And completely missed them! There was traffic. Traffic stops you, but not the thieves from getting away! I've pestered all departments for extra men. You've had twice as many men for a week now. And the result? Twice as many hold-ups! Right, get out! -Boss. -What now? They don't have the guts, so I'll say it: the guys are lost. We have no clues. The informers aren't saying anything. They're scared. Contradictory testimonies. Is this a lesson on witness reliability? I'd never do such a thing. But we would like to know what you would do. You can leave now. Special measures to lead the fight against the pseudo-Dillinger. Inspector Kramer declares war on gangs. IN FACE OF INCREASE IN HOLD-UPS IN FRANCE Good evening. Good evening. The boss is waiting for you. Good evening. How are you? Take a seat. I've done what was necessary. I'm losing you as a customer in the night club, since it looks like… you're going on holiday. Here's the full set. They're all trump cards. No, put that there. A little scotch? -Yes. -Cigarette? No, no. There you go honey. Thank you. Cheers! He says thanks. The cards are perfect. More genuine than the real ones! And let me know if you need passports. -So long. -So long. Good evening, Sir. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, Sir. Good evening. He gave me 100 francs, and didn't even look at me. What do I owe you? -Five francs, Sir. -OK. Thank you. Tenth grade… ninth… sixth… Where are you? Look! There! Next to your inseparable friend. -What was his name? -Robert. That's it. Yes, you were always fighting. With children, it's a sign of great friendship. True. Can I? All of us are looking for our childhood, to some extent. He was the sheriff, and you, leader of the bandits. No. It was the other way round. Sheriffs and bandits who studied here are probably now respectable family men. Not all of them. Your friend, he was a brilliant lad. Have you seen him since? No. Unfortunately. I'd like to know what became of him. You wouldn't like it. Really? Do you know where he is? I'd like to know. Goodbye, Sir. And thank you. Great to see you. Thirty years! It was both marvellous, and a bit sad… Enough about me! I'd like to know what you are up to! I'm in the police. The police? Well that's great! Come and see me again. SAINT TERESA COLLEGE You coming? No. I'll wait for you here. -Why? -I'd rather. Lisieux, 12 June 1938… Hello, Dillinger. That's enough, you dirty rat! I'll get you at break when the priest goes for a piss. Here you are, Mom. -You were leaving without waiting for me. -Here. Of course not, Mom. Still with that lout with the moustache! I can't stand him. What a face! Look who you hang around with! You'll pay for it. And of course, you don't want to come in, you're not hungry or thirsty. No, Mom. I've had enough. I can't read the papers! All the hold-ups, I ended up thinking it was you. Then don't read them. Stop before they arrest you. Listen, Mom, I have to go. Get out of here! I'd prefer… I'd prefer that you went to my funeral. I'll use the vacation to work on my book. What's the point of writing? For my pension. We're not executives! You'll find a publisher? You bet! They'll snap it up. In literature, prison teaches you more than the Sorbonne. Really? And if you survive a penal colony, you'll really clean up. But there are no more penal colonies! It's a shame, a loss for French literature. You're brainy! I was a brilliant student… in La Santé prison! So my name will be in a book? Black on white. I give you my word as a man of letters! Here. -Oh, there you are! -Hello! -Hello! -Guys, here. Chuck the dough up in the air, if you want, but don't get robbed. He who pays his debts… So Sir knows his classics. Here! Here! Here! Is that enough for you? Gentlemen, place your bets. -Nine, that's you. -Eight. Gentlemen, place your bets. Place your bets, Gentlemen. Look at them! No more bets. No more bets. Eight, black, even and manque. Who is 20? For me, maximum on seven. Maximum on seven, Madam. -Place your bets. -No more bets. Place your bets. No more bets. Nine, red, odd and manque. No more bets please. No more bets, Madam. 30, red, even and passe. -Who has the single? -Me. 13, black, odd and manque. Go through, Gentlemen. I knew it. -No more bets. -Place your bets, Gentlemen. Place your bets, Gentlemen. Let me. -23, maximum, red. -One to nine. One to eight! Place your bets Gentlemen. Nine, please. No more bets. Place your bets. Red, odd and manque. No more bets. Four. Number four for Sir. No more bets. No more, Gentlemen. Maximum on 17. Maximum on 17. Place your bets. No more bets. 17, black, odd and manque. Here you are, Madam. A banco of five. Ten thousand. 22 please. Four on red. 22, Sir. Final seven, last two. 50 on nine. Nine to the bank. Banco 20,000. Banco ten thousand. Next deal. Next deal at ten thousand. Thank you. Thank you, Sir. 10,000, next deal. 10,000, deal. This hand is no good. It has already passed five times. Ten thousand. Taken. The hand is at ten thousand. Taken at ten thousand. Banco ten thousand. You want half? -With the table. -OK. Banco. Banco after the table. Banco seul. Banco seul requested. Eight. No doubt I've lost. What a hand! Amazing. Nine for the banker. Good evening, Madam. Madam. -Was it a good evening, Madam? -Not really. Right. -There you go. -Thank you. -Some tokens please. -Yes Madam. There you go Madam. Goodbye. ROLL AND STOP Want to share one? OK. CHAMPS-ELYSÉES CARPARK So? Sorry, but nothing. You're scared, right? Me? Of course not! Listen to me! I've left you alone for over six months now. Inspector, this Dillinger, I don't know him. We've looked everywhere, unfortunately, we don't know who he is! Unfortunately. Unfortunately, we're going to close your club. And unfortunately, take your chick's driving license. Poor girl, she's going to be bored! What will she do, without me? Save money. It's not my fault if we haven't seen this bastard. You're looking at getting busted and being an outcast. Quite a price to pay! We dish out some tasty punishments. This is bullshit! OK, goodnight. -Inspector. -So, you've come to your senses? So, er, I think that he's on the Riviera. I believe. OK. So what do I do now? You've got a six-month extension. Is that all? You've got the deal. Just. Look! He's never done that. Dangerous. Women talk. Don't worry, she's a nice girl. I've seen her steal. So that's alright then! Go on. NICE-CÔTE D'AZUR AIRPORT -I wasn't sure you'd come. -Why? The papers say you're looking for Dillinger in the Paris suburbs. Never believe what the papers say. If you think he's here, we'll call all department heads. Later. First, I need an artist. Here's the photo of a 12-year-old. Draw him like he would look today. How old is he now? My age. Yeah… I don't think it's a good likeness. That's the portrait of a man who hasn't suffered. You know, when you get your ass kicked it leaves a mark on your face. I understand. How about this? Maybe. Thanks, good job. We'll publish a smaller version. No, I want it enlarged. And don't publish anything. No leaks. What about informers? No informers either. We can't do much without them. Here, you've got something better than informers: call all the casino face-recognisers. Oh! Take a seat gentlemen. Do you know this man? He was in our place last Wednesday. I think he left at about four in the morning. With a regular called Stella Manzoni. BEWARE! THIS MAN IS DANGEROUS… No need to worry. The little sheriff is in town. So what? Think! We've done whatever we liked for two years, and where? In Paris! Where the sheriff has an army of cops: small, large, thinkers, scientists, on foot, in cars, even in helicopters! Did they find us? Don't just sulk, answer me! Well, since we all agree, we're going to move. But first we'll do a job. The biggest job I've ever done. No one has thought of it. Except me! Listen guys. On the highway when you leave Nice, between August 14 and 15, you know how many cars go through there? 200,000. The takings: a million francs. What's happening? Answer. Where are you? We'll send back-up. Hello? Answer. Look out! Shit! Keep going. STOP - POLICE Hey! I'm out of gas. There's a hotel here. Stop. WHITE CROSS INN Did you hear that? Er… who could it be? Go and see, you'll find out. Go on! What do you want? Rooms for the night. It's not a hotel. But there's a 3-star hotel four kilometres away. Are you crazy! Refusing customers? We can't afford to lose 500 francs. Open the door. We don't have room. -Where do you sleep? -I don't let my room. No, but you'll give it to us. It's that way. Upstairs. Go on! And keep calm. Leave me alone. What's wrong? You're lucky you don't understand. Understand what? All this is your life, not mine. Look! At this time, I'd be in the casino. Perhaps I wasn't very happy, but… but I was living in openly. Now, you've taught me to be afraid. And look where we are now. We'll leave tomorrow. And then? With you, I'll always pull through. With a gun! Everyone kills. With schemes and dirty tricks. I've had enough… we'll get out of here. We'll go to America. Apparently, in some parts it's always summer. You're dreaming. You're not normal. Shut up. It'll turn out fine. You know I'm lucky. No, darling. Not any more you're not. Your 500 francs are going to cost us. You two in there! I need antiseptic and cotton. Yes, immediately. -You go. -No, you. -What a wimp! -I can't stand blood. Come on! I'm coming. I've got some, but downstairs. Go on then. But watch yourself. Give it here. Get back in there! Here you are. -What's wrong? -Nothing. Fill it up. Fill the jerrycans in the trunk too. You stocking up? The price is rising. Everything is getting more expensive. Who is he? Check the oil. Again? CALL THE POLICE What do I owe you? 60 francs. Everything's fine now, you can go. Bye. POLICE Inspector Lefebvre. Hello. -We know where they are. -Great. I've reported them. You're crazy! Why? You're the only one who knows. As soon as they hear the cops, they'll kill you. They'll kill you too. No, not me. Because I'll tell them you reported them. She's just reported you to the cops. No! No, Robert! Robert! Bastard! No! Robert, no! Stella! It's nothing. It's nothing. No! Now we've got you, I'm in no rush. So. Let's start from the beginning. Where's the money you stole from the banks? I wanna see her. We're talking hundreds of millions. Stella is my woman and she's injured. How long is this game going to last? Where did you put the money? If I see Stella alive, I'll give you all the money in the world. We're looking after her! She'll pull through! So, this bank money? Banks are everyone, and everyone is no one. So I'm not stealing from anyone! But I'll admit: you're boring me. Everyone out! Leave me alone. Stubborn as a mule. What are you thinking? If you tell us about the money, you might save your life. Which isn't that easy in your case. Yeah. Judges can kill legally. They'll have a great time with me. I hate seeing you sitting where I've questioned so many criminals. It was easy, that's your job. It was easy because they weren't friends. A cop's friendship! You don't know what friendship is. You're trying to trick me with feelings! Hello, yes? Ah… When? OK. Stella. Yes. I want to spit in your face. Come. Take him away. Ah. -Good morning. -Morning. You could have worn your robe. Take a seat, please. Thank you. Most of it has been in the newspapers. You're a star. You robbed a bank. Not very original! But you left ten gold ingots somewhere. Why? You won't answer? OK. There's something which doesn't make sense. Most criminals act out of megalomania, to get their names in the newspapers, but with you it's the opposite: you use the name Dillinger, after an American gangster of the 1930s, whose life and death were quite sordid, and you're proud of that name but not of your real one. That's not normal. I'd like a cigarette. Why do you call yourself Dillinger? You don't want to say? Fine. The psychiatrists will give us the answer. No, no doctors! That's the proof you need them. Those who refuse this examination are always the really sick ones. It's a well-known fact. Yes, hello? Oh, sorry. My respects, Sir. Ah? The case… I've settled it. The nonsuit was issued last week. Yes, justified. No, no appeal. Quick, that way! That way! -What's going on? -I don't know. I'll go see. What's going on? Someone's escaped! -Bye. -See you tomorrow. Bye. Hey! Come here. Is Charles in? -Yes. -Is he alone? Yes, I think so. Leave us alone. -I need a network to hide me. -We can do that. I know some men who… But it costs a lot of money. I'll have it. I'll do it as quickly as possible and call you tomorrow evening. No, I'll call you. As you wish. But don't give your name. I'll recognise your voice. We're friends. Friends? I hope so… for your sake. You don't have anywhere to go? What do you care? I live near here. A light. Don't you trust me? THE GANGSTER DILLINGER SO BOLD HE SIGNS HIS HOLD-UPS FEARSOME FRENCH BANDIT WHO IDOLISES DILLINGER DILLINGER STEALS ROBE DILLINGER ESCAPES FRENCH DILLINGER SEEN IN NICE BEWARE! THIS MAN IS DANGEROUS Except I… won't end up like him. Listen, you're going to help me. Go to my mother's, in the south. Explain. There are boxes full of money in the attic. Bring them to me. There's a train which arrives in Paris at 8 a.m. I'll wait for you at the station. Let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If thou, O Lord, shouldst mark iniquities… I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, my soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning. For with the Lord there is steadfast love, and with him is plenteous redemption. And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities. -May the Lord be with you. -And also with you. Lord, Our Father… The station. Express train 52, from Vintimiglia, Nice, Marseilles and Lyons is arriving. Look out! No! Let's go. Robert! Attention! Passengers who have arrived from Nice, this is the police: stay where you are. There is a dangerous individual in the station. I repeat: passengers who have arrived from Nice, this is the police, stay where you are. There is a dangerous individual in the station. No! Bastard! Bastard! Help me! No! Calm down. Finish him off! Hang him! Was that his full name? Yes. Alias Dillinger. Subtitle translation by: Carlos Alvarez.
