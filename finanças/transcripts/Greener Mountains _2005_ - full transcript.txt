OH. - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing. Oh. I was just thinking. I... I always thought I was going to outlive this old oak. 700 years old and I think I'm gonna outlast it. If that isn't human conceit, I don't know what is. - Well, you still might. - And it still might rain Johnnie Walker in April. I also always thought you'd be taking over this place. - I can't. - I know. I know. I know. THE LAKE, IT MOVES. Sometimes it quivers, like it's filled with a feeling it can't express. That's 'cause it has no outlet. It's fed by a deep unsounded crevice. - Hey, bug. Want to help me out? - Sure. - All right. I want you to see if you can find any dirty glasses hanging around. - Okay, then, uh, are we going fishing? - Yeah. We're gonna be eating perch till Christmas. Very funny. OH, MAN. - Oh. Hey, I think there's some more dirty glasses... LIFE'S FUNNY SOMETIMES. You never know what tiny turn of events is gonna tilt your entire life on its axis. I'm J... p... oh my god! - Oh, I'm sorry. - That's my fault. - I... oh, I'm such a dork. I'll get it. - Are these yours? - Yeah, but they... - they're really good. - Really? Oh, thank you. I've never been here before. It's... - It's pretty amazing. Do you want a little tour? - Yeah, that'd be great. I mean, if you're not too busy... - no! No. No. Welcome to barton's. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Are you sure you don't want me to get something? - I got it. It's fine. - Okay. - THIS IS THE LAKE. - LOOK AT THE DUCK! LOOK AT THE DUCK! It's beautiful. - It's bottomless. Jacques cousteau came here in 1968 and swam down to this crevice and almost got lost. Yeah, so... HERE'S A LITTLE SECRET. You really do only have one soulmate alive. Oh sure, you can find a decent backup along the way. But, oh, you're gonna be kicking yourself the rest of your life if you didn't do everything in your power to grab 'em when you had the chance. - Yeah, a lot of things I don't know how to do. Is that poison Ivy? NO, THAT IS. Thank you. Oh my god, this tree. - Yeah, the old oak. - How old is this tree? - Uh, 700 years, give or take. - Unbelievable. My sister always gives it to me straight. So I was kind of dreading the conversation, but when I finally talked to her, she said, "Alice, you know what you got to do." So I finally got the courage to break up with him and move out. And that's why I'm here. - Cure your broken heart. - No, mm-mmm! To clear my head, so I don't make any more stupid choices about men. THIS IS SO GOOD. - Real Vermont cheddar cheese soup, every single Friday come rain or apocalypse. - So what about you? - About what? - Well... who are you? What do you do when you're not here... when you're not up here working? - What do you mean? - Well, what do you do? I mean... - Hey, bug! You got to meet someone. Come here. - Okay. - Hey, bug, Alice. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME TODAY, J.P. I got four perch this big. - Aww, man, I wish I could have gone with you. - Want to go fishing tomorrow? - Yeah sure, maybe if we go real early. Let me help you out with that, bug. So this is Alice. She's from New York. - Yup. Pleasure to meet you, bug. - But she's not coming fishing. - Uh-uh, that's just me and you, bug. Fishing is just me and you. He loves sunglasses. ♪ THERE WAS A TIME IN MY LIFE... ♪ - All right, we've got art, temporary art, science of art, sports science. - Why can't you tell her that you work here all year long? - Oh yeah, that's good, toe. "Howdy, I'm j.P. I work at barton's." That's hot. - What's wrong with that? - She's an artist. She lives in New York City. Her last boyfriend was a law student. - SO? - HERE'S SOMETHING. Environmental architecture. See... see that sounds smart. - Why don't you pick something that you... that you know? - You don't get it, toe. She was hugging the tree. MEN... UNZIP THEIR FLIES and their brains fall out, I swear. I AM NEVER GONNA DO JUSTICE TO THAT OLD OAK. - Stop putting your work down. You've a real talent. It's something to be proud of. - It's nothing compared to what you're studying. - Sustainable architecture using renewable resources, big deal. - It is a big deal, a very big deal. - Thanks, Alice. - Hey, Jimmy! - Hey, Holly, Mike. Hey, me and toe rigged up an antenna for the old 13-inch, so you can catch the sox-yanks games this weekend. - Oh ho ho. Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. When are you gonna learn? It's August! The Yankees have been beating the Red Sox in August longer than your ma's been around. Nothing has changed since 1918. - 1918? - Walk away, Alice. - And you obviously weren't born in new england, were you, uh... - Alice. - Alice. Alice, there are three dates that all new england children know by heart. 1620, 1776... - And 1918. - Why? - Aha! Because that was the year that the Red Sox spat in the eye of the gods. They sold the greatest player who ever played the game, babe Ruth. And they sold him to the hated New York Yankees. And they have not won a world series... BUT YOU LIKE THE Red Sox. Jimmy, I LIKE THE Red Sox. I have no choice. I wasn't taught differently, but you? You're young. There's still hope. Every Summer the sox suck us in with glorious aprils and record-setting mays, giving us hope for the whole Summer months. And then it's August and they start to fade. Sometimes they'll... they'll wait until mid-September to turn on us. And sometimes, once in a blue moon, they'll wait and wait and wait until late October... world series... and then... And then Billy Buckner lets a dribbler through his legs and they carve your heart out... That is the curse of the bambino, Alice. That is the curse of the bambino. So whatever you do, do not let this kid talk you into being a Red Sox fan. - But you're still gonna watch the game tonight, right? - Well, I wouldn't miss it. - Thank you, Mike. - You're welcome. - I know this one. Artist is... Monet! - Van gogh. - Van gogh! Really? - Yeah. - Damn it! Okay. Keep 'em coming. - Where would you find brueghel's painting, uh, "icarus"? - I don't know. - Musee des beaux-arts. - All right, whatever. Okay, quiz me on Manhattan geography. - Where is the statue of Liberty? THAT'S NOT NICE. - Staten island. SEEMS TO ME YOU GOT TWO CHOICES: Become what others want you to be or be what you are, and then others will want to be that. - So when you study, do you hole yourself up in a little carrel in a library or do you go to a coffee house or what? - You know where I like to go? Um, "the cloisters." Yeah, it's so peaceful there. - J.P., I go there to draw. - No way. - Yes, we should meet up there in the fall. - Yeah, definitely. - Wait a minute, you go all the way up to the cloisters from nyu to study? - Hm-hmm, yeah. - Nyu... - That's it. Give me that. It's in greenwich village. What was I thinking? - You weren't thinking. - Come on, Alice. Big stick! - Run! Run run run run! - Oh! Oh ho ho! Well, I guess we found the boy's weakness. - Cue the fairies. - I don't want to be a fairy anymore, j.P. - What? - I don't want to be a fairy anymore, j.P.! - No one else can play mustardseed like you. I think I... I should be a leading man or something. - Actors. ♪ SO BLACK OF HUE ♪ ♪ with orange-tawny bill ♪ ♪ the throstle with his note so true ♪ ♪ the wren with little quill. ♪ - What angel wakes me from my flowery bed? - She's your mom? - Yeah, I'm adopted. - Cool. - I know. My name's j.P. - Threetoe. - Huh? - That's my name. Threetoe. Don't ask. So are you sure this is okay? 'Cause we didn't rehearse this part. - Don't worry, threetoe. I'm a professional stuntman. - Wow. - I know. Peaseblossum, cobweb, moth, mustardseed. - Grab the rope. - Ready! - And I... - go. - Damn. - You're the best mustardseed we've ever had. Threetoe? Toe, toe? - Really? - Yeah, really. Perfect. Perfect. - Right? - "Weaving spiders, come not here; hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!" I can't believe you roped me into this. When does your semester start? - The first week of September. - How 'bout I stay up here and we drive down together? WE PROBABLY MAKE A MILLION DECISIONS in our lives. Two, maybe three, have the capacity to truly alter our lives forever. When did you decide this? - I've been thinking about it for a while now. Just seems right. - You're bluffing. - Huh? He hasn't placed a bet. - Gee, buddy, I thought you were going to u.V.M. I mean, Holly and me were gonna come up... YOUR BET, J.P. - Plus this. - Your lucky softball? - Yup. - That's a mighty steep bet there, partner. - I can handle it, Mike. - Ah, it's too rich for me. - Yeah, if I wanted high stakes, I'd go to Vegas. - Call. - Pair of twos. - Nines and fours. - Damn! - Oh, it ain't wise to bluff the bluffer who taught you in the first place. Holly AND ME, WE WERE GONNA COME UP. Maybe catch a few games, remember? IN ANY CASE, Jimmy, IT'S WAY TOO LATE to transfer to nyu now. You'd have to wait a year. - Well, I can't. - Well, hell, let's get Eric up here. Raise. - Eric your grandson? - Yeah, he's managing the whole nyu endowment portfolio or something. Isn't he, counsel? - That he is. - Well, hell, let's get him up here. YOU REMEMBER MUGGS. - How are you? - Eric. - And this is Max. He's the sherriff of our town. - Yeah, I remember you used to come up when you were a kid. - That's right. That's right. J.P., I remember. - Yeah, I'm your uncle. - He is my uncle, isn't he? How are you, uncle j? - I'm good. - Enough yapping. Who's dealing? - All right, give me those. - You okay, grammy? - Oh, I would be if the damn doctor would give me something stronger than cherry syrup to get rid of it. - Maybe Dr. A should be writing prescriptions down at the state liquor store. - Well, if you shut up, I'll go see him tomorrow. - So can you help out j.P., Eric? - Are you kidding? Grammy, I would do anything for you. I would do anything for her. I'll make it happen. - Cool. So I'm going to nyu. All right. - "Fairies, skip hence..." Len asked me if I wasn't too old to bring up a baby. I told him any baby'd be lucky to be brought up by me. Most moms don't have a speck of wisdom to pass on, haven't lived long enough. - Mommy's losing too much for you? AND OF COURSE I'm BONDED through two different companies. I maintain an independent auditor for my books if you like. Although that does cost a little more. I have received three different awards from chambers of commerce for excellence in resort management. I love my work. I have no pets, or children, or a spouse or... or friends of any kind. - Well, this looks great. I just have one question. Why did you leave the catskill resort? - The comics, they drove me nuts. - You're in. - Is this Chuck estes? I love Chuck estes. - Yeah, I caught him at smalls jazz club last time I was down there. - You're the most interesting... Who are you, j.P. Barton? J.P. - Is that your girl? - Yeah. Yeah yeah, that's... uh, you can wave to her. All right, that's Alice. She's from New York. I'm gonna get your salads for you. - Uh, with chicken. - Yeah, with chicken. - She's a little cutie. PEASEBLOSSUM! COBWEB! MOTH! Mustardseed. - READY. - AND I. BE KIND AND COURTEOUS TO THIS GENTLEMAN. Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes. - Dude, this is whack. - Whack doesn't even cover it. It is a pretty place, though, huh? - Yeah. - It really is an incredible piece of land. I got to show you guys what's across the lake. It's been years since I was there, but there're acres AND ACRES ALL UNDEVELOPED. - J.P., we're gonna miss you. There're three things that people choose to live their lives by. Religion, money, or love. If you choose religion, don't worry about which one. They're all just guesses anyway. If you choose money, always remember that the more you have, the dumber the ways you'll find to spend it. - And last but not least, love. LOVE. Well, you're just gonna have to work that one out for yourself 'cause I'm not divulging my secrets yet. - I may still need 'em. To j.P. - Okay. We have to... 6:00 a.m.... we have to meet, and then we're leaving. 6:00, okay? HELLO?! UNCLE J.P.! OH MY GOD! THERE HE IS. - Uncle j.P.! - J-bird! - Hi. - Hey, Eric tells me you could take us for a little cruise across the lake. - Oh man, it's way too dark. - Come on. - You won't be able to see anything. - Come on, j. - Boo. Boo. - Slides. I've got slides of the whole area in the lodge. - Yeah. SLIDES. - Slides. - Let's go. Let's go, excellent. - Okay. - So, Mr. J.P., I brought you some Vermont cheddar cheese soup. WHERE ARE YOU GUYS THINKING HOUSES? - This is the lake. Pretty? - Wow. This shows there's 4,000,000 miles in acres. THAT IS A LOT OF ACRES. What's that. - That's the gazebo. The best view of the lake from here. - That's nice. - That's gorgeous. That's the chest sweat lodge. I burned it down once. WAIT, THERE WAS A FIRE IN THE SWEAT LODGE? - THAT IS THE OLD OAK. - THE OLD OAK! - THAT'S PRETTY. - WAIT WAIT. It's on the wrong side. IT'S ON THIS SIDE. - WHAT? - Yeah. - What am I talking about? - I don't know. - I don't even... seriously, this whole area is next to the abenaki sacred land. - Sacred like church? - Beck does like a good slide show. THAT'S A PARTY. THAT WAS NICE. Is this blurry to anyone else? LOOK AT THIS JUNK. - Hey, uncle j, I have a question. - Huh? - Why the hurry? - Huh? - I mean, for me to get you into nyu. Why... why the hurry? - Oh, 'cause I told Alice I was already a student there. YOU WHAT? - Wait, you, uh... What? You made that up to... to impress her? YEAH, I've NEVER BEEN TO New York. LOOK AT Mr. SLICK HERE. - I told her I was studying environmental architecture. - I even found out what kind of music she likes AND I BURNED CDs OF THE SAME STUFF. I... I... I... I told her I jogged from greenwich village to the cloisters to study. THAT IS HILARIOUS! That's hilarious. - Oh man, I love her. I love her more than anyone can love anyone. I would do anything to make that girl happy. Anything. I'll be whoever that girl wants me to be. And I can do it too. - Hey, you okay? - What do you want? - Uh, j.P. Sent me. He said you wanted to talk to me. - What? - Well, I feel really stupid. Um, I'm sorry. - He sent you over here? - Yeah, he... he said you wanted to see me. Um, I don't know. I guess he thought we'd get along, New York and all. - Look, I'm sorry. I'll... I'll leave you alone. - I'm not pissed at you. - What are you doing? - I'm leaving. - Really? You know, Alice, you're not gonna be able to catch a bus in town tonight, but, uh... You're more than welcome to catch a ride to New York with me in the morning. - Yeah? I'm sure I could tell you some stories of some of the losers I fell in love with. - What are you still doing here? - I think she went into town with Eric for something. - Right. - She'll be back. She'll be back. "ABOUT SUFFERING, THEY WERE NEVER WRONG, the old masters. How well they understood its human position. How it takes place when someone else is eating or opening a window, or just walking dully along." W.H. Auden wrote that. - Come on. - Howdy, I'm Randall. Oh, uh, did you forget something? - I'm gonna have to let you go. - Why? Did I do something wrong? I can change. I'm malleable. Was it the way I said "howdy"? - No, we don't need you anymore. - But I just started. - Yeah, well, you just finished too. - Well... if that doesn't beat all! Hmm. - Why are you still here? - Well, I figure if I'm gonna get fired, I might as well get a free meal out of it. - 935. - What? - I just figured it out. I've had 935 bowls. - Well, technically, that's a cup. - I've had 935 cups of real Vermont cheddar cheese soup every Friday lunch of my stupid life. - Well, to be so lucky. - Lucky? Well, don't be so sure. Do you realize what a waste of your life it is to eat this every Friday of every week of every year of your life? - Well, I love dairy. Milk, cheese, butter, you name it, I love it. Especially your more viscous dairy. Oh, homogenized milk is fine and I really enjoy sour cream because of the texture. It's very, very thick. But I prefer dairy with a little more meat to it, you know, more lumpy dairy. Your cottage cheeses, your paneers, your clabbered creams. Whew, give me a plate of curd and a glass of warm clabbered milk and I'm in pig heaven.

Have you heard from her? - What are you talking about? - You know you have to write a letter to get a letter? - I did. - Send another one. - She doesn't want to talk to me, she doesn't want to talk to me. - Oh, then that's that. I mean, you did write one whole letter. - I'm better off by myself. - Alone is fine. Lonely ain't. - Just leave it, okay?

But let me just tell you how foolish it seems from the vantage point of a woman who has only a few years left on this planet to see you give up the chase on a person you love. - I don't l... - shut up, let me finish. THANK YOU. In 73 years, I've made my share of bone-headed choices, things that I wish I had done differently. But looking back, the one thing I never ever regret was doing too much for someone I love. - Okay, here... here we go. Studio right across from hunter campus. No, it's got to be in the east village, my man. - Then you're gonna have to take a subway to class every day. - I don't care. If it's not in this radius, skip it. - There's a fine line between romancing and stalking. - Funny. - You can't just hop in the car, drive down there, say hi? - No, I can't. I told her I'm this guy, this New York guy. I got to be prepared. That's why she went with Eric. Why wouldn't she? I'm a nobody from the middle of nowhere. Who would you choose? - You. Of course your breasts would have to be a lot bigger. - How come you're not unpacked? - I figured I'd wait to see what transpires. - Believe me. You can unpack. I'm so out of here this time. - Hm-hmm. - Trust me. Hey, what's up, my man? Big ones biting? Let me see. - These fish suck. - Well, there's always tomorrow. - No. Threetoe says you're leaving today. - Yup, I'm going to New York City. You're gonna come visit me, aren't you? You better. Me and bug in the big apple, sounds fun, doesn't it? - A bug in a big apple. That's funny. - It kinda is. All right, hold on. A couple more minutes. A lot of cords under here... I got to get this TV... - I've already got one TV I don't watch. - Well, I thought since you can't get out that this way you can still keep in touch with things. Watch. - Oh. But... aww. Where's the shower cam? It's been awhile since I've seen myself a naked man. I haven't seen a wrinkle-free naked man since the Johnson administration. A lot of restless people in my family. My mother was restless, my brother, my husband, all got the hell out of here. I guess I've always prepared myself to live alone. Well... - Well, what? - You gonna get your butt out of here or do I have to drive you down to New York myself? - You sure you're all right up here? - If you're not off the premises in 30 seconds, I'm calling the cops. 30... 29! 28. - All right. Wish me luck. - Luck! - Whoo-hoo! How you doing, Francis? - Hey, j.P. - Hey, j. I thought you'd be gone by now. - What are you doing here? - I've been so bored with my job, really for longer than I care to think about. So I quit. I heard you were leaving, so, uh, I figured I'd jump at the chance. I'm gonna take over for you for a while. This way there's someone to look after m, keep an eye on the books, you know, make sure things are running okay. You have no idea how much I needed a change like this. Well, good luck in New York. Let me know if there's anything I can do. Okay? - Shit! I'll have to have muggs take a look at this piece of junk as soon as he gets back from St. Albans. Since I'm stuck here, maybe we can... maybe we can grab lunch later. I don't know. - Definitely, we'd love to. He's fine. You know, the same. He actually talked about coming up here later this Summer. I'll believe it when it happens. OH DEAR. This place was never much your father's type of place. - It's funny. He always talks about how much he loved growing up here. - That's only because he got out. Oh, you'll find out that everything looks much better in hindsight, everything. I can look back on your grandfather's funeral with nostalgia. But then again, he was a cheating bird-dogger. That's not much of a surprise. - Well, I love it here. And I'm going to raise you two peanuts. - Huh. I fold. - Got you again, grammy. - Not bad. But I'm gonna find it. - Yeah? Find what? - Your tell. Everyone has one. Particularly men. Oh, they're the worst bluffers because they enjoy it so much. - Randall, don't worry. It's just for a little... - don't talk. - Like two more... - don't talk! - Hey. Can we talk? - I'm playing the piano. - Oh, yeah. Didn't notice that. So New York mail's running a little slow down there, huh? - Uh-huh. - You shouldn't be with him. He's so unbelievably wrong for you. Okay, I'm sorry. It's none of my business. He's such an asshole though! - Is that why you pimped me out to him? - What? Did you he tell you that? My god, the guy's a freaking sociopath! - Oh, after he got you into nyu? Nice work. - You're the asshole. UH, IT'S GETTING LATE. We should let you have some rest. - M: No, you should let me have some scotch. I'll be getting all the rest I need soon enough. - Now don't say that. - Oh please. As my legal counsel, I order you to sit your ass back down and play some cards, Lenny. And watch this one. I think he's palming the deck. Hey, Sundance, you in or what? Good, double ante. This is the guy who looks after my books. Hey, len, is it too late for me to write him out of my will? - I already told you. I don't want anything. - Oh, sure you do. You just don't know it yet. - Look, I don't want it, okay. I don't want to... I don't want to live your life over again, all right?! - So? - Awful nice of you helping j.P. Out like this. - He's a really good kid. I like him. I like him a lot. Did you... did you figure out what's wrong with it? - Yeah, I think so, but unfortunately it's gonna take a couple days to get the parts I need. - Can't you just jury-rig it? - I'm sorry, sorry. It's the best I can do. - J.P., you're still here! That's great. - Let me just sign you guys in. - Thank you. We usually get the oak tree cabin. - You'll have to wait. Walter, why don't you take number 12? This is good. - Thank you. TOMORROW WE'LL HEAD OUT ACROSS THE LAKE. You know, I saw the sketches you did of the oak this morning, you're really amazing. - You know, there's just something magical about this place. I could paint it forever. - Well, you won't have to if I set you up at the right gallery. I mean, you could make a fortune off those sketches. - I'm good. - I know how much you love it here. That's... that's why I brought you. That's why I called you after so long. - You know, I think I'm going to take a walk around the lake before it gets too dark. - Okay. I'll go with you. - Oh, thank you. I just... I'd rather be alone tonight. KINDA WANTED TO GET UP EARLY AS WELL. YEAH, ME TOO. I just love waking up to a sunrise. - It's amazing how similar we are. It's always been one of my favorite things. - HEY, J. - HEYA. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? - Sure. - Over here. I want to talk in private. Why'd you lie to Alice? - Come again? - You told her I set you two up. - You didn't? - You know I didn't. - Set us up, didn't set us up, you know, it was so long ago, I hardly remember. - You're a real asshole, you know that? - What do you want from me? Huh? I mean, what is it that you want, j? And why are you still here? Look, don't take your frustrations out on me. All right. Even if I hadn't told her you set us up, who do you think she would have ended up with, huh? No hard feelings, okay. - What do you think Alice would say if I told her you lied to her that night? - Go ahead. Tell her. Tell her anything you want. It's your word against mine, but right now, Jimmy, yours really doesn't stack up that well. - I guess she'll just have to take your word for it, won't she? - Uh, excuse me, what do you think you're doing? Excuse me! Hello! What are you... - you got to see this. - I'm not gonna deal with your crap! - No, Alice, come here. No, come here. - Let go of me. Stop! Let go of me, what is your problem?! - Alice, just sit down... - I swear, if you don't let go of me, I'm gonna kick you so bad! - Sit down and watch this, please. - Gosh! - No. - Aah! Get off of me! - Alice. Oww! Damn it, Alice! Just watch this. Watch! - What?! - Watch. This stupid... - watch what?! - Ah, here it comes. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? - Sure. - Over here. I want to talk in private. What?! You've got to be kidding me?! - Get off me. - Stupid! - That is you! God, grow up. - Damn it! - What's wrong? Is something wrong? - She's resting. I just came by to see how she was doing. - Roxanal. This is morphine. - It's low dosage for her pain. - She has been suffering a lot. - This is what you're giving her? - It'll make her feel better. - What do you have that'll make her better? - Look, Jimmy, if I could do more, I'd do more. - Come on, j. - Vick would never do anything to hurt m. - Right now we need to make the time she has left as comfortable as possible. - Come on, wake up. Shut up, Eric! Just shut up. You write her something else. Write her something else! - All right, m, wake up. - Take easy, j.P. - Come on, m, wake up. - Don't shake her. - Wake up. Wake up, m. - That's way out of line. - What are you guys giving her? Come on, m, wake up! - Stop it, let's go. I want you out of here right now. Go! VERY GOOD, MY LORD. - Very good, my lord. Very good, my lord. - Bug, stop itching it. You're gonna make it worse. - I can't help it. - Unbelievable. Come on, bug. Stop itching it. - What up, bro? What's up, man? Listen, we got box seats. Yeah, it's next Saturday. Yeah, tell Stacey to bring all her friends. Oh, I'll call you back in a few, Kevin. J-bird, if you're not busy later, me, Eric, and his chick are going boating. - Who? - Eric and, uh... Ally... whatever her name is. - Alice. Her name's Alice. She's not his chick. - Right. - Don't touch, okay, bug? And stay out of the woods, you got it? GOT IT. - Barton's. - Hey, j.P., it's Russ. - Yeah. - Listen, about that linen order. I just want to let you guys know my boss is being a real tight-ass and won't let me return the deposit. - Deposit? - Yeah, there was a cancelation fee. - I didn't... I didn't cancel. - Someone did. Joe got a call from you guys this morning. J.P.? - Yeah. HEY, Eric. What are you really doing here? - I don't follow. - I spoke to your boss in New York. He said you didn't quit. - Well, no, not officially. - Thank you! So? - So firstly, I didn't quit. - Do you see, Alice? He's lying. He's not here to run the place. - What's the issue? I wanted to keep my health benefits a couple months. - You called his boss? - Yeah, for good reason. - You called up his boss out of nowhere and interrogated him? - No, not really? - You're unbelievable! - It's all right... - no, it's not all right. What has gotten into you? - Nothing. - Nothing?! Nothing! You accuse Eric, you attack m! - I didn't attack m. He's lying. - Eric didn't tell me! Len did! - Len? You're being a real asshole lately. - Yeah, for good reason. - Well, I don't know why you care, anyway. I thought you were leaving. - Maybe I will. - Well, no one's stopping you. - No one's stopping you. - Shut up, Eric. - M: "The moon methinks looks with a watery eye; and when she weeps, weeps every little flower, lamenting some enforced chastity." I wasn't too bad in my day, was I? - You're great. - Oh, you're full of it, but I'll let it slide this time. Quickest way to kill somebody is to save 'em from the thing that you think is gonna kill 'em. - M, we're going for a ride. SLEEP THOU, and I will wind thee in my arms. Fairies, begone, and be all ways away. So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist... - M: The female Ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm. HOW I LOVE THEE. How I adore thee. - Welcome, good Robin. See'st thou this sweet sight? Her dotage now I do begin to pity: For, meeting her of late behind the wood, seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool, I did upbraid her... - M: Oh. What's wrong? - Oh nothing. I was just thinking. I... I always thought you would be taking over this place. - I can't. - I know. I know. It's not too late. - For what? - To change your mind. Len is still putting together a new will. - I'm sorry. I wish I could, but I... I can't. I just don't want it. - What were you thinking of taking her out like that? - I thought it'd be good for her to see the play. - She is in no shape to be dragged halfway across this resort. - Take it easy, vick. His heart was in the right place. - It's inexcusable! He could have killed her! - Yeah, I know. - I'm sorry. - I want you to stay away from her, do you hear me? You're not to go near her. - That's enough. - So you just stay away. - I should never have taken m out last night. SHE LOOKED PRETTY HAPPY TO ME. - No, I'm an idiot. I screw everything up... with m, with Alice. I don't know what to do, toe. You should have seen the smile she gave me last night. No matter what I try, it just ends up being the wrong thing. - Yeah. - It's true my entire life. And with Alice, it's even worse. The minute I talk to her, I just... ugh! I'm an idiot. I give up. THAT'S OKAY. - M: Hold it! Hold it. Hold it! This is my lucky softball. It never let me down. Play ball! RIGHT DOWN BY THE OLD DOCK. - Hey, threetoe. - Hey. - Uh, can I ask you a favor? - Uh-huh. - I... I was supposed to repaint the whole shake by the lake scene. And I kind of messed it up and it looks like a four-year old did it. And you're like the best drawer that I've ever seen. - No worries. I'll take care of it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You coming? - Yeah, I'll be right there. I should have known. - Alice, hold on a second. I just wanted to apologize for before. I was being stupid, okay? Besides, they really do need to be painted. And I can't draw. - Fine. Bring 'em over. - You rock. - Whatever. - Thank you. The whole time I was up in that tree fort, I just stared at the stars. And that feeling, I don't know where it came from, but that feeling stayed with me the entire night. It was like that tree held me in its palm. And, uh... I knew what it was all about. - You really are meant to live here, aren't you? I mean, it was nothing like the first time I went to the top of the empire state building. That was just an unbelievable feeling. That's why I'm so pumped to go back down in the fall. I'm gonna go to hunter college though. Much better... - don't. Just don't. - What? - Why do you have to lie? - No, really, I'm going to hunter college. - You've never been to New York. - Sure I have. I grew up there. I just spent my summers here. - J.P., I heard you that night. I heard you laughing and telling everyone how you fooled me. - Um... - Everything is a lie with you, j.P. Now, you have no idea how much I... Everything is a lie. - Eric's a liar. I swear. - Have you ever been to New York? Hey. - Hey. - How's she doing? - This is for her pain. - Does it help? - I don't know. Uh, it's really the best they can do. I'm afraid to leave it out with the way j.P.'S been acting. - J.P. Would never do anything to hurt m. - No, I hate to think it. You know, but I have to be on the safe side. This is... this is my grammy. This is my grammy we're talking about. To him, she's just a person that he's mooched off of all these years. You never know what somebody like that will do. - I found it up here. See? This thing. - Let's go, bug. You had no intention of running this place. - Of course I did. I just feel like barton's needs a little renovating. - It worked the way it is for the last 80 years. - Yeah, but you change this place up a bit, you can get a clientele with some serious bank. - It's never been what m wanted. - God bless her and I love her to death, really I do, but m is from a different generation. You know, she doesn't understand that change is exactly what this place needs. - A championship golf course, a luxury spa, a conference room? Our guests could never afford this. - Well, maybe they're not the kind of guests that we want. - Maybe yours aren't. - Maybe. Fortunately, it's not your business. - I grew up on this property. Anything that happens here is my business. - No, I mean it's not your business. You're not family. - If you leave right now, I won't tell m about any of this. I wouldn't want her to get hurt. - I don't think you get it. See, this is gonna happen whether you like it or not. Okay, but don't get me wrong, j. I think you're terrific at running this place. Really, I do. But I feel like you could be better if you had more to work with. I'm saying there's no reason why you couldn't stay on. You help me out. I help you out. That is the way the world works. I can make you a very rich man, j. - I never wanted to be a rich man. - Wake up, m. M, are you awake? Can you hear me? Please wake up. - Wake up, j. Wake up. Come on, you're out of here, buddy. - What the... - look, we got a restraining order, Jimmy, all right? Len says you're out of control. Now you got to stay away from m. - I'm out of control?! What about this guy? You know what he's trying to do? He's trying to take this place away from m. - What'd you do with m's medicine? - Huh? - You flush it again. - You liar! He's lying! - Let's go. - You stupid... - you have to get him away from her. Get him away from her! - Just walk away, walk away. - M, wake up! M! Eric's lying. This is ridiculous. - I guess he's just not himself. - Hey, how come you guys aren't out at the game? WE'RE SITTING THIS ONE OUT. - Yeah, it just felt kind of weird playing, you know, with m... - Yeah. That's exactly why we have to play. You know how much she loves that game. - She's not even gonna see it. - If she wakes up for even two seconds, it's gonna be worth it. - What did you do to this thing? - Oh shit. - Don't put more logs on it. - Jesus. - HEY, LEN. This is, uh... - What the hell is this? - What did you do? - I don't know about fires. I'm FROM Manhattan. - Okay, careful. Careful. Come on, toe, faster! Faster! - I'm going, I'm going! I'm so so sorry, m. I'm so sorry. - Oh, my bad, sorry. This is insane, j.P. - I know what I'm doing. - We're pushing an old lady through the forest like a keg of bud. And you say that you know what you're doing. - I got a plan. - Okay, well, what's your plan? - Sneak m out. - We did that. - I know I didn't really figure it out past that. I kind of thought we'd be caught by now. FOR GOD'S SAKE, LEN. He tried to burn her house down. He tried to kill my grandmother. - Well, I don't think he was trying to kill her, but, yes, I think it is time to do something. - Damn right, it is. COME ON, YOU GUYS. M'S WATCHING. Mike, you're pitching. - Play ball. - Play ball! - They're coming, j.P. - Come on. GAH! CAN YOU HEAR ME? Can you hear... wake up! Wake up! I need you to listen to me right now, m. I want it! Okay, you can't give it to Eric. He's gonna ruin everything you've done with the place. Wake up. Come on, m. Do you understand what I'm saying, m? - Get him off of her. - I want it. I want it. I want it. - Jim, Jim, come on. Calm down! - Damn it, Eric! Sorry, Max. - Jesus! Jimmy! - Threetoe, come on, man. All right, let him go. Let him go. Help me get her back to the house while len is still... before she catches pneumonia. So all she has to do is sign, right? - Come on, holl... big stick! Big stick! You've got it. - This should just be between your grandmother and me. - Sure. Let's go. - All right, you guys! - T... turn it on. The monitor. I want to watch the game. I haven't missed a game in 37 years. - J.P., jump in, man. J.P., there was nothing else you could do. They're gonna lock you up. Okay? Just jump in. I'll drive you anywhere you want, in town, New York, Japan. Just jump in! - M: Your bet, j.P. - Come on! Thank you. - M: Oh, it ain't wise to bluff the bluffer who taught you in the first place. You can keep your softball. IT'S NOT THAT. - Oh, my dear boy. You know what a googolplex is? It's a one with a hundred zeros after it. - That's a lot. - It's a lot a lot. But it's nothing compared to what you're worth to me. No matter what your title is or what you win or lose at. It's who you are right now... That's just perfect. So I'm betting a googolplex of these on you, on this guy here. - Stop! - The cops are right there. - Toe, stop the truck! - J.P., look, if you go back there, they're gonna arrest you. You tried already. Okay? - I got to tell her. - Tell who?! - I got to tell her. - Alice or m?! I don't know what you're... - yup. - Come on, right here. Right here, bug. YEAH! GO, J.P. Yeah! - Yeah, j.P.! - There he is. - Just at the top is just the list of, uh, people who will get something. Okay? And then we go to... - Here you go, buddy. - Thanks, bug. - New batter! - I'm just gonna bat. - Let's let him play the game, sir. - Looks like I'm gonna need a ball. Let's give m one last show, okay? Hit one out there. - Why aren't the cops stopping him? - Doesn't matter. She's signing the will right now. - Here, do you want to sign right here, m? - Oh. - All right, come on, let's bat. Batter up. - Go, j.P. Okay, here he goes. - Hey, batter, batter, batter. - Okay, hit this one out of here. - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! - You did it. - I hope so. - You hope so? - All right, he got to play his stupid game. Can you please now... - You were right. You were right about everything. I am a liar. I've been lying to you since I first met you. I've never been to New York. I wasn't going to nyu. I don't know what a cloister even is. I've never been out of Vermont. I've never been 20 miles from here. I'm just some dumb nobody guy from some dumb nowhere place. That's... that's not even right. I'm a dumb nobody, but this place isn't. I don't care what anyone thinks. It may not be the fanciest place, but I love everything about it. I love the lake, I love the staff and I love the crazy guests. I love m. I love this place because this place is m. I never wanted to lie to you. I didn't, but I had to. I wanted to be with you so much, more than anything, that I would have told you anything, anything that I thought would make you like me. I don't have money. I got a crappy car. I've never been anywhere cool. And I couldn't see how you could ever like me the way that I liked you. Then I blew it even worse. I don't know if telling the truth from the start would have changed anything, but I needed to tell you now because I'm sick of pretending to be who I'm not. I know it makes me sound like a dumb hick to love everything here, but I do. Oh, I can't wait to sit under the old oak when I'm 90. And be amazed that that tree is gonna be here longer than I am. - Okay, Jimmy. Come on, come on, come on. - You... you probably think I'm lying about all this. Why would you ever believe me? - Come on, Jimmy. Come on. - Just once I want you to know that I'm telling you the truth. - Listen, Jimmy, look, look. Jimmy, we're talking about assaulting an officer, breaking and entering, reckless endangerment, I got to do this, okay? Come on. - I love you. I love you. I love you. Now am I telling the truth? - It is pretty funny you're going to jail, isn't it? - Jail or no jail, I don't care. Just knowing you're not gonna run the place is all I need to know. - Guess what? - Hmm? - I was just talking to len. It turns out m didn't see the end of the game. So enjoy your new digs and stay out of trouble, okay? - M: Days in between the seasons are the best. You can feel movement in everything. Change... I never feared change or death. You can't live in a place like this and fear death. - How are you? I'm so glad you could make it. - I'm sorry, j.P. She was a remarkable woman. Why don't the three of us get together in the dining room after the memorial? - Sure. - Well, there's never a good time to talk about these things, but given the circumstances, it's best to deal with it as soon as possible. I'm NOT SURE WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. She left the place to me, so let's... - well, actually, she didn't. - What do you mean "she didn't"? - It's a little complicated. - She left it to him? - Sort of. - What do you mean "sort of"? - Well, m left it to j.P., but only if he wants it. She never wanted to put pressure on you, j.P., to stick around. - What... what if he doesn't want it? - Then it goes to you. Well, he doesn't. You don't. You don't want to... you don't want to be stuck in this dump forever. - As a matter of fact, I can't think of anything I want more than to be stuck in this dump forever. - This is... Len, he's not... he's not blood. He's not family. She said she was leaving it to me. How could she not leave it to me? - Well, she did leave you something. - Yeah, what? - Your tell. - My what? - Your tell. She told me to let you know your left eyebrow raises. - She got you. She's giving you your tell. Your left eyebrow raises when you bluff. - Max. Max, uh, you guys can go now. Just get him out of here. - He's family. - No, he's not. He's not. He is not family. Okay, I am family and I want him out of here now. - Jimmy is more family than anyone here. I GOT TO GET BACK TO THE STATION. Will you excuse me for now? - This is unbelievable. I don't unders... what are you doing? Why... why aren't you taking him with you? - I just gave him a ride over here. The charges have been dropped. - By whom? - By me. - Okay, Max, hey! Listen to me. Are you listening? - Yeah. - Okay. He tried to kill my grandmother. He attacked me. He is a felon. I am still pressing charges. Now do your goddamned job! - I wouldn't do that if I were you. - What is this? What is... - well? - S... why don't you just forget it? - Yeah, I thought you might say that. I brought a pie. Would you like some pie? - M: I never found the will to travel.
