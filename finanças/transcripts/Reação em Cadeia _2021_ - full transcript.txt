CHAIN REACTION - We did it? - I think so. We're rich! Rich! Fucking hell! I'm gonna buy you that longboard. What's that, bro? - Fucking go! - Calm down! Speed it up! Go! Go, damn it! - I'll kill you! - Go! Go! Get out! Fuck! Zulu! Zulu, we'll crash! Stop it! It's over, forget it, there's nothing we can do! Easy, Lara! Close the fucking door! I'm returning the papers. Papers my ass! I want the fucking money! Shut up, Zulu! Fuck! Your money is here, damn it! It's no use returning any document, they'll kill us either way. - Speed it up! - Fucking go! - He's coming! - Go that way! I've learned there are only two ways: the right one and the wrong one. It's always been an absolute truth for me until life hit me three times and I had to take the third way. I'll tell you from the start. I fell in love with Dani at first sight. We soon got married, had Isa. It was the best time of my life until I start working too hard. Marriage is like an equation, an algorithm. The result changes depending on the variables, but a line never changes. If you choose to share your life with someone, you have to be willing to give in and listen. Talk to me, my girl! This accountability is bullshit, isn't it? It's my "man", boss. I'm talking to her. Pay attention to her. I've checked this stuff at least three times, boss. - Stuff? - Yeah. Stuff? You know the difference between an accountant and an internal auditor? Post-graduation? - No. - No... You're an accountant. Oh, right. An auditor listens to the spreadsheet like if she were... An oracle. Oracles never lie. Check a file for me? Check a file for me? Felipe! - Me? - The file. Yeah! - OK. - Check Brandão's trips. If dinner is included in the hotel's daily rate. - Is it? - Almost there, hold on. Is it a posting error? - Add it. - Add it? It has the price of dinner in the daily rate. Brandão and that madman face. OK, do it: take all the value from column 3... And take the one from 7. The total is... - A hundred fifty thousand? - R$ 152,230.97 Nice! Now my partner... - To field work. - Boss, can I go with you? You already know the difference between an accountant and an internal auditor? When you learn, maybe I'll take you. How long you've been working at Traveling? A year? No, 10 months. Tadeu, you found out all this in two days? - I'm good at it, right? - Fuck! That's the problem. This house doesn't match neither with salary nor with income tax of Brandão. But the hottie he lives with matches perfectly. Former call girl... Oh, my Brazil! - And us? - What about us? We deliver Brandão on a tray to Traveling and what's next? Or you think some other director will make it easy after he gets fired? That's the plan, right? It will be hard, but we gotta keep trying. Yeah! What about me? What you mean? You're getting some money, aren't you? - Yeah, but what if it's the last one? - Again with this talk, Tadeu? You've got this taxi. You're a lawyer, right? Taxi is disguise and support, and Law is a pain in the ass! That's what I like, man. I should have taken the contest to the Federal Police, man. There's still time. Brandão is right. Look at that! Look at this woman, man! How beautiful! My God, I'd marry her tomorrow. Let me see it. - Look at this. - Great, let's go. - Wait! Details-- - Details? We got it all. Go, go! I'm dying to go back to the office. And you, crazy to watch some porn online, aren't you? Porn? You crazy? I've told you about my neighbor who lives on the third floor? Over 20 times. Is she real? I've never seen her. OK. Do you want me to introduce you to her? Who you wanna fool, man? Let's go. This is the house Mr. Brandão bought to Mrs. ... What's her name again? Priscila Dantas, in the Luxor Rio Condominium. Mr. Wolf, will you believe this underdog who's just joined the company? I've been working here for years. Come on! Transport overpricing, commission transfers, falsified restaurant bills. As if Mr. Brandão's high salary weren't enough, he also made the company lose... How much was it? It's... R$ 2.273.412,27, sir. In the last two years. This is a lie! You'd rather go out escorted by the security guards, or should I call the police? What... years of dedication. I won't be treated like that! You have to prove what you're talking about. What is it? You will regret it, accountant! I'm not an accountant, I'm an auditor. - Guilherme... - Mr. Wolf, I'm sorry. - Good job today. - Thank you. Mr. Vieira wants to do a meeting with you, tomorrow morning, at his home. I'll send you his address later. Mr. Vieira? A meeting with me at his house? Another thing... He sent this bonus here for you. Go! You have to sign here the receipt, please. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. I don't wanna get carried away, but... It could be a promotion, Dani. - That's good. - Good? It's fantastic, Dani! I'm meeting one of Brazil’s richest entrepreneurs in his house. - It's more than good, right? - It's even better than good! Daddy will arrest all the bad guys in the Universe. Super daddy! Sit here, baby, please! Let's have dinner. Sit down! Eat your meat... Baby, did you hear the messages I sent you today? I... I did., but I was in such a rush. It was an unusual day. It was another typical day of your life, you mean. Daughter, it's not just the pasta! Time is a matter of preference, Guilherme. I'll eat you then. I'll put a little cheese up here, some olive oil... Guilherme, I'm trying to talk to you for more than 15 days, a very important thing! Not now. Yuck! Yuck! This one is too big, Dad. It has too many letters and ends with a "W". There is no word ending with a "W". How come, my love? Come here! "Sweet we put in hot chocolate at the Christmas party." What is that white candy that looks like snow? Don't remember? Marshmallow. Marshmallow. - Very good! - Don't read. An even more complicated challenge now begins: Finding a way to protect the babies in the vastness of the ocean. It looks like today is a lucky day for this troop And look, a palm leaf... Yes, sir? Hi, I have a meeting with Mr. Vieira. I was told I need to enter through the back door. - Your name, please. - Luís Guilherme Machado. Open your trunk, please! - All right? - Open your trunk, please! Done. Please, hands on the hood. Zé Maria, do you copy me? Speak on the fucking radio, Zé Maria! After you put this missile-proof armored glass, the radio won't work properly, boss. - Open this fucking shit, Zé Maria! - Roger that. Put the car over there and wait for me. I'll follow you. - Hey, come! - Yeah. - Morning, Amanda. - Morning, Montanha. This is Guilherme, our new accountant. - How are you? - How are you, Guilherme? Wait a moment, please. It took a while, but we're here. Good afternoon, Amanda. - Good afternoon, Amanda. - Good afternoon, Mr. Vieira. Precisely. Yes, senator. He's in a meeting. Yeah. Right. - Just a minute. - Good afternoon, Amanda Good afternoon, deputy. Mr. Vieira waits for you. Good afternoon! I see. It will take a while, OK? I see. GUI, DON'T FORGET OUR DINNER. - Thank you, Amanda. - See you! THE RESERVATION IS FOR 8 P.M. THEN WE HAVE TO TALK OK, BABE! Right! Do you know if it will take any longer? I've been here for a while now, and I have a dinner scheduled with my family. Wait just another minute, OK? You've done a great job taking care of Traveling, Guilherme. Thank you, Mr. Vieira. You are an attentive boy. I like this kind of employee: honest, attentive. But I've noticed your approach is a little... unorthodox, for what I understood. Well I... - I never broke no rules, sir. - Isadora is seven years old? She is, exactly. Your marriage to Daniele, how's it going? Well... Guilherme, I didn't call you here because I need a bureaucrat. I need a creative internal auditor. Of course! For which company? I'm talking about Léon Vieira Group. - Oh! - Any questions? Where is my room? This is your new room, accountant. Montanha, since we're starting this daily interaction, would you-- Deep down, he's friendly. Your call is being routed to the mailbox. Dani, where are you? I've called you 20 times, you don't answer. Honey, I'm so sorry for being late. Sorry, I promise I'll make it up! but it was for good reason, OK? I'll explain when I arrive. Tell Isa I'm coming. Dani! Wait, it's my family! Dani, where's Isa? Where's Isa? Isa! Sweetheart! Is she ok? Sweetheart, what happened? Are you ok? What happened to her? She inhaled a lot of smoke, but she's already out of harm. - Dad. - Yes? - Why you took so long? - Me? - The pot exploded. - The pot exploded? Sorry, sweetheart. You know when you get married thinking you know the person, and then you realize that... If you hadn't been late, the pot wouldn't have exploded. I know. Did you feel any pain? - I can't take it anymore! - Calm down, babe. I can't take it anymore! I want a divorce, corporal Marinho, That's post-traumatic stress. - I want a divorce, Guilherme. - You need to talk. I've been trying to tell you for a long time now. In person, by phone, by email... - You don't listen to me anymore! - Not here. She knows everything. What? I'm here now. If I did something wrong, I'm here to fix it. I can always listen to you. Whenever you need... I'm moving to Switzerland with Isadora. What are you talking about? I was accepted into that postgraduate program I told you about. By any chance do you remember about it? What? Of course not. - My daughter... - Exactly. You are tired, you almost set the house on fire. If I knew you'd to listen to me, I would've done it before. On purpose. Sweetheart! Come here! Look at me! Daddy can't be with you now, but we'll soon be together, OK? You can leave with me in my room. - I can. - Isa... Mommy has already told you. Come on, let's go. - The plane won't wait for us. - We've always lived together. I don't wanna live far from daddy. Baby, come here. This was the first hit, I'm sure I was my fault. I managed to lose my daughter and the love of my life at once. I knew Isa's absence was going to hurt me. but I had no idea I'd miss Dani so much. I'm being hanged! - Can I open it? - Yes, you can! - A medal? From what? - Best dad in the world. Gold Medal Dad. - Are they the invoices I asked? - I'm not an accountant, bro. DST again? Talk to me, my partner! What code did this guy create? Always this acronym, these three letters, DST. Driver... It doesn't make sense. Guilherme? Sorry, I thought I knew you. Lara? Meeting Lara again after 15 years, was a breath of life. I believed she was the love of my life. We even ran away from home, but her ex-boyfriend appeared out of nowhere and took her away. I was unable to react. Did you talk to this bitch? She's not a bitch! Don't talk about her like that. We were 15 years old, and that was in another life. And she is... Fucking hot! - My advice? - No, thanks. - Get off! - Don't be jealous. I was in a hell of a hole and then she appeared. Look at her calling. Don't be a fool! Don't answer it! - Tadeu, gimme that! - Play hard once in your life. - Tadeu! - Fuck! Hello! I'm fine, and you? Of course I can. Deal. Bro, I'll pay mine. - I'm picking Lara up. - You don't learn. Don't say I didn't warn you, OK? See you. - It's been a long time. - Yeah. Have you been talking to anyone from school? - I lost contact with everyone. - But with one you didn't. - I'll put on a song. - You have to... That's how you change it. If the girls don't look at me I wear glasses And every now and then I drive my car the wrong way I don't have my glasses - It's been 20 years? - Nineteen. But what's the point of being a teenager if you won't get rejected by the hottest girl in school? - Yeah, thanks. - Thank you. And if it weren't for you I would probably be at home depressed, crying for missing my daughter. - She sent me a video. - Let me see it. Look at her! Covered with coats. So beautiful! What's this face? Are you ok? Yeah, I'm OK. - Are you sure? - I am. It's nothing with you. Sorry, I didn't want to kill the mood. You didn't. I just wanted to know if you were fine. It's my mom. She has cancer. Cancer? It's... - Is it the type that has no cure? - There is a cure, yes. But she will try to do the treatment in the public health system. Do you know how long my mom has to wait for the procedure she needs to do? - Health plan don't cover it? - Health plan... If you knew all the shit I've done in my life, you'd run away right now. How much is the procedure? - A fortune. - A fortune... Never mind! I already regret bringing up this subject. All right! Just tell me how much. How am I going to get fifty thousand? You said fifty thousand? - Yes, but I... - I have part of it. - I don't know how I'll get-- - I have twenty thousand. I can get some credit with the bank. But I don't know when I'll be able to pay you back. Don't worry! Pay me whenever you can. It's your mom's life. Right? It's the most important thing. Count on me. Right? Morning, big bear! - I'll let him know, deputy. - Amanda, good morning! Morning, my love! My best friend. Shall we unfold this topic today? Boss, there are a lot of "D" here, and a lot of "S", and "T", as well. I just don't get what they mean. DST, that's the question. - I don't get it. - Me neither. It's the mystery the spreadsheet insists on not revealing. Sorry for asking it, but why don't you ask the person who worked here before you? - I guess the person knows...? - It's another mystery. Where is my predecessor? Well, it's done. Will you need me for anything else? It's late, right? No, young man. Your services are no longer needed on this front. - OK. - You can go. - This suitcase is a freebie? - What? The new Traveling collection they're about to launch. It's small on the outside, with a big space on the inside, I was really in need of a suitcase, so... Yeah, I don't know. This suitcase was already here when I arrived, it's not mine. OK, but if you have no one to give and... I want it. Like I said, it's not mine. Right. I'm leaving. If it becomes trash, I... Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. Hi, Lara. This is me, Guilherme. Sorry I left another message for you. You might be with your mother, right? Take good care of her, we'll talk later. Kisses! Kisses! Did you do this alone, sweetheart? I did it myself, daddy. Nobody helped me. Look what I wrote: "strawberry". It's much harder than "marshmallow". It's a fruit. It is, you're right... Come to bed, sweetheart! It's time. I gotta go, mom is calling. A big kiss. I love you! Right, sweetie! Tell your mom I sent her a kiss. Love you! Miss you so much! - Take care! - Kisses, bye! "Rui Barbosa." "Position of Lúcio Afranio in Rome." Seven letters, starts with an "S": senator. Good job, Gui! "Anniversary of the city of Rio de Ja..." "S", senator... Talk to me! OK, let's go. It's "S" as in senator, "D" as in deputy... "T"... "T", technician... Transport, no. TBT, no. It's... Treasurer... Fuck! Treasurer, man! Yeah! That's it. Love you too, baby. Won't you tell me how you got that money? No. Okay then. You swear you didn't screw up? You did no shit... Screw up? Me? Screwing up is getting coke to sell and snorting it all. I solve your problem, and you accuse me? Fucking hell! - I'm not accusing you, shit! - You are!! - Fuck you! - Go fuck yourself! - You have this habit. - Yeah, me. You know I try not to be jealous, don't you? But you know I am. You also know I love you so fucking much. - You know that - You do? - A lot! - How much? - Oh, hottie, fucking a lot! - How much? Lara, I fucking love you! You're my creamy! We'll have a family someday, right? We adopt a fucking brat. Put him on to run up and down. I'd love to have a kid running around. What does family have to do with the money? Nothing. It has to do with some real talk. Family... Family doesn't hide shit from each other. - You know that, right? - Now I see. OK, then. So, twenty years ago... Twenty? You're going far. School. Guilherme. What you said? Remember Gui? - Gui? - He wore glasses... He wore braces and everyone made fun of it, remember? - Gui... from the bus? - Yeah. That sucker? Such a loser? That's shit, huh? I knew that. - I knew it... - I'd get the money? No, I knew it was shit I fucking knew it! - Stop it, fuck! - Fuck you! - Dude, it was a loan. - Look! Smells the shit from afar. I'll pay, it was a loan. By the way, both of us will pay it back, you hear me? Why do you think this guy lent you this money? Tell me! Tell me! Tell me, damn it! You won't say it, I will: because he wants to fuck you. He wants to fuck you. He wants to fuck you, damn it! Gui is a sensible guy, a good guy. - Sensible... - I was there to save your skin. I did it all to help you. You won't mess with Cabeça anymore, you hear me? - Zulu, you're not a dealer. - I know! - Kiss me! - Kiss me, my ass! It's a kiss to thank me. Look what I got for you. - Fucking idiot. - Kiss me! Come here! You're really hot. - You bring so much trouble, you know. - I fucking love you! - Fuck it! - Damn it! Hottie! - Faith in God, Dinamite? - Faith! I'll go there! - I'll go there! - I told you I do it. You're fucking stubborn! Relax! Trust me! You gotta relax. Stop it, Zulu! - Can you listen to me once? - Tell me! Save your energy for the race. You've had your chance. Look here, win this shit! Now you come with this. "Win this shit." Have you ever seen me lose, hottie? Yes! Sweetie, excuse me. - There you are. - What's up, princess? Evening! Check it, Cabeça. I have more interesting things to check. Hey, Cabeça? There must be about twenty thousand here. - Want me to check it out? - Twenty, Dinamite? Half is missing, right? You know there is an easier way to solve this debt, don't you? Is the victory paying double? Is the victory paying double, Dynamite? That's right. - It's the double. - Bet it all on Zulu. Who will you pair with playboy? It's Lancaster. He's there already. You sure? If he wins, is the debt cleared? What if he loses it? I pay however you want. Now we're talking! I like it. I'll watch in the VIP area. Come with me! Where's playboy? Tell him to pair. Let's fucking start it! What's up, bro? Wanna die? Wanna die, bro? Tadeu, you're sat down? - If I die you have to know-- - Tadeu, listen to me! Look, I found a scheme you won't imagine, man. It's as big as Operation Car Wash. Listen to me! I can die, man! Tadeu, you will die if you don't come running here now. I need your help. See you! It's over now, Cabeça. To end the bullshit. I'll give you back the money, the debt is clear, and you come hang out with me. I'm not a whore. I told you. Didn't I tell you, hottie? Didn't I tell you I was going to fucking win? - What's up, Zulu? - What's up, Cabeça? - Let's celebrate. - Yeah, let's. - No way. - Dynamite, I told you! I flew by. The debt is clear, Cabeça. Let's go, Zulu! It's in the house. Peace and love! - Let's drink. - Let's, man! - No! - Follow us. - R$ 9.873.200. - Ten million, OK. What about it? Yeah, 10 million. What's gonna happen is: part of this money goes to Vieira's partner's account in the Cayman Islands. It's an offshore account and it's not illegal. But the money vanishes. We lose track of it. Then, it comes back to Brazil as an investment by the group and is transferred to accounts DST. Deputy, Senator and Treasurer. - Treasurer? - Treasurer! Yeah, like for buying off parliamentary amendments. It's very well thought out. Genius stuff. - Guilherme-- - We gotta find this genius now. - What genius? - The genius. The one who worked in my position. Before I got in, he worked for Vieira. We gotta find him, he disappeared. No one can find him anymore, but you can. Do we have the funds for this investigation? I'll get it by tomorrow. And you'll be well paid this time. - Let's toast. - I know... "I know"? Fuck, Tadeu! I thought I was gonna do bureaucratic work at the holding I find out about a corruption scheme that hasn't happened since "Petrolão" and your reply is "I know". - Fuck! - No, I need... I need to tell you something else. Serious, urgent stuff. No, she wouldn't do it. Don't laugh, Tadeu, because... having a mom with cancer must be fucked up. So... Dude, you wanna know her mom's address for the last 5 years? The cemetery. Her boyfriend, the cute one who lives with her, is José Luís Lima. Ever heard about him? Zulu? Shit, that's enough. Money's mine. I'll do whatever I want with it. Besides, I don't need friends to get jobs for me. And I don't fuck their lives up afterwards. The second hit caught me off guard and was also my fault. I didn't listen to Tadeu, my only real friend. It hurt less than the first one, but it hurt. Made me sure the problem was me. - Let's hit it, Zulu. - Chill out, hottie! Let's stay for a while. Hold on, hottie! Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. Snort some, playboy. - Give it to him, Dinamite. - I'm freaking good, Cabeça. - Take it down a notch, Zulu. - I'm fine. You're my guests of honor. At least smoke some weed then you'll go, all right? - All right!? - All right, Cabeça! So, let's go. Fuck, Zulu! Let's go! Hey, playboy, let's smoke some weed! We'll be back. - Please! - Fucking wait, Cabeça! Wait, Zulu! Fucking go. Hey, Zulu. Remember Gledson? Good guy, right? But he doesn't pay up. It's just part of it, Cabeça. I almost paid for it all. Almost it all! Gledson owed me some money. I told him there were taxes, but this motherfucker thinks I don't deserve earning taxes. Please! Cabeça! Please! Hand me the bag, Careca. When you owe the bank, Gledson, what happens to your debt? It goes down? - Does it, Gledson? Answer! - No... What about credit cards? SELIC tax? But you think I'm not being fair. Let me show you what I do to people who think they don't owe me taxes. This is what fucking happens to motherfuckers. I lent you some money, am I right? You paid me an equal amount, but it took you some time. - Am I right? - Yeah. Do you think it's not fair to pay me the extra fees? How much is SELIC tax? Is it 10%? There's "spread" too, right? That's how you say it? - How much is it now? - What's that, bro? Economic talk, you fucker. We never agreed on anything like this. Tell me, Dinamite, did we? Dinamite can prove you we didn't, Cabeça. I'm no liar, motherfucker. - I'm not, fuck. I'm not! - You fucked up my watch? I'm not, Cabeça. I'll fucking pay. But can't you make it easier for your buddy? - Easier? - Yeah, Cabeça. I'm no analgesic, motherfucker. I'm a businessman, you know? And my business goes like this. No, Cabeça! No! - He's got a family man, Cabeça. - Stop it. For God's sake! Stop it, Cabeça! - Stop, Cabeça! Fuck! - Don't do it, man. - Fuck! - Stop it! Wait. Don't do this. - How much do I owe you? - Fifty percent. Fifty? I don't have it. Please! - Bring the lady here! - No. Fuck. Stop it. Fifty it is. That's between you and me. Fifty percent. Two weeks. If you don't pay me, she comes to my bed and you motherfucker go to Gledson's place. - Get it? - Got it. - Got it? - Yeah. Now get out. - Out of here. Escort them out. - We're leaving. - Calm down! - Stop it! I'm really impressed. - I lost the bet. - Bet? Yeah, with my associate. He said you'd make it and I said you wouldn't. And if you discovered it probably Federal Police and the Public Ministry can do it too. Right? Well, if they have access to the documents I did it wouldn't be that hard. But Mr. Vieira, what matters most now is finding the criminal. I don't like raising suspicions without evidence, but I believe your partner might be a suspect. You can be sure of that, Guilherme. Of course he's involved. Everyone is. Or do you think people climb up the ladder in this country without getting involved? Guilherme, in two weeks, the congress will vote for a law that has nothing to do with our business, but in this law, there's a "tortoise". You know that, right? When the congressmen try to approve a law that's not very honest, without people realizing it. Almost that. We have to guarantee they approve this "tortoise" or our society gets disorganized. Got it? Look, Mr. Vieira, I really appreciate the opportunity, but... The scheme you discovered won't work. It's sluggish. No deputy wants to get the money in trust or offshore accounts. They're all afraid of the Federal Police. How can we make this money get to them? Hotels are not an option. Lots of cameras. Mr. Vieira, you've given me way too many details. More details than I wished to know. I want to quit the company immediately. But your real job has just started, Guilherme. Will you leave me alone? Mr. Vieira, my job is to find out embezzlements. What you want is someone else 's job. Not mine. Deep down, every detective wants to commit the perfect crime. I'm no detective. I guarantee it's not my case. I've always been a nerd. At school I was even afraid of cheating on exams. And I'm still a nerd, excuse me, sir. Apparently, you're already involved, Guilherme. And we don't want anything bad to happen to your daughter. Mr. Vieira, please. The voting is in two weeks, Guilherme. Think fast. The third hit was the toughest. I found out I lost all I worked hard for because I worked for a criminal. It was hard! But I had to do something. I came here in my own free will, chief. That's Vieira's scheme. I don't know how that works. I just-- - The scheme, then? - Look, I... I just got in this job, I don't know about anything that is happening. - I deal with his stuff there. - Have you been promoted? Have you met this guy? - He did your job. - What job? Money laundry, active corruption... What else do you do for Vieira? That's what I just told you: I just got this job, I don't know how he does his business. I'm impressed how there's people so aloof in this country. Guilherme, if you cooperate, you won't even get 2 years of jail-time. And you won't end up like your pal. You're dealing with dangerous people, Guilherme. Let's call your lawyer. If you give me the documents I need to arrest your boss, this whistleblower agreement will help you a lot. You're kidding me, right? People used to say the same thing about the guys in Operation Car Wash. I... I have no documents. I can't prove anything. But you can get these documents. Just make it work, bro. Or it's gonna get rough. Princess! I'll give you a house, food and clean clothes. Damn! Fuck. Why the face? Come on in. What the fuck? What happened? - Is everything all right? - What happened? Fuck, man! Guilherme! Are you alive? And this is how the flying fish lives. They slap their tails on the water. Fuck the flying fish. Bro, the best way out is the whistleblower agreement. - How do I...? - Listen to me. You give what the Feds want and you'll be in house arrest in no time. With an electronic ankle bracelet... and won't even serve the whole time. OK, and then what? What do I do? What kind of job do you think I'll get afterwards with such a resumé? Look Tadeu... I'm innocent, man. It doesn't make any sense to pay for something I didn't do. OK! What if I get to take the documents out of Vieira's house and hand them to the police, what do you think Vieira is going to do to my daughter? Excuse me. New rules here, accountant: No work in the dark here. - Got it, but why? - No money for the night-vision cam? Do your job, and I do mine... - Is the boss here? - On his way to the airport. Come on, talk to me. Give me a sign, please. Boss? Felipe, check when Traveling will release their next collection. - Send it to me by message. - Accountant! - Accountant? - Mr. Viera. Sorry, the accountant freaked out. Accountant my ass! I'm an auditor. - Get your hands off me! - Are you crazy? Get your hands off me! Sorry, Mr. Vieira. If I don't get onboard now, I'll get to Brasília late. We'll have to anticipate the release of the next collection. Have you been transferred to the marketing department? It must be done here in your house and only for VIP guests. Some more VIP than others. The suitcase is small but it has lots of inner space for senators and deputies. So you break in and arrest everybody. - When will the party be? - Soon. The voting on the Chamber of Deputies is in two weeks. Are you sure they'll all show up? These are the names I know by heart but there'll be more. Why haven't you brought the docs to arrest Vieira? I can't leave his house with the docs. It's impossible. On the day of the party, I'll also get a suitcase as a gift. I have only one condition to help you. How 's that? What condition? This is a list of Vieira's henchmen that are watching my daughter abroad. I managed to track all of them by Vieira's bank transfers. If these guys are not arrested abroad, no one's gonna be arrested here. Guilherme, have you understood that you'll have to serve a minimum sentence anyway? That's OK if I go arrested and serve the maximum time, as long as no one touches my daughter. I'll get arrested and Vieira escapes. No! Hold on, man! We can't arrest these guys in a foreign country. You are the Feds, right? Make it work. - I don't believe it. - Give me a break. I have a cold. What's wrong? - How much have you snorted? - I haven't. How much? Do you think this shit moves without gas? It doesn't. And stop bitching! I'm not snorting. Trust me. Shit! I'm not okay. My head is bursting. Fuck you! The couple is really pretty. Gui! Fuck! I'm sorry. I didn't wanna lie to you. Does your mom approve? I mean... - Did she approve of your husband? - I was desperate, okay? I’ll find a way to pay you. I’m so embarrassed! Embarrassed? Are you embarrassed? Let’s do the following: since you are willing to pay me, what about twice a week? Because I might get bored if it’s more than twice. - That was not part of the plan. - That? You know what I’m talking about. Both of us at the beach. Gui, I have nothing to say. I can only tell you I’ll pay till the last penny. Just don’t know how but I will. Now get out of here before Zulu sees you. Get out! Zulu? I wanna talk to him too. Then we switch places without leaving the car and go. OK. How are we gonna cut the cash? You give me back what you’ve stolen from me. It was a loan. You give me back what you’ve borrowed and keep the rest. OK. That's right. You’ll run all this risk and my hottie and I are getting the biggest share? You think I’m stupid, don’t you? First, if you do everything exactly as I say, the risk is close to zero. Second, I’ll really think you’re stupid if you refuse to make easy money. And what do you get? Let me guess, you win Lara's heart. Do you wanna buy my wife, you asshole? I just want my freedom and my daughter’s safety. I’m just buying your help, but I'd do everything by myself if I could. What are you doing? Give up on this idea. Wait! I want some guarantee. - What guarantee, Zulu? - Cash. Then you leave, get out. - Did you call anyone? - I fucking did. - What the fuck is this? - Just checking... - Get out, Guilherme.- - Are you setting up against me? Setting up, bro? What do you mean? Bro my ass, bring me the blondie. - Wait! - Stop it! We’re here to get your fucking dough! Fucking bullshit! Your woman was meeting this loser behind your back. Only you can’t see. Do you have the money to pay me? In case you don’t, fuck you and she’s coming with me. Grab her! - Wait! - Stop it! - Just a sec. - No, Guilherme. How much money are we talking about here? - It’s none of your business. - It is. I need them for a scheme and it’s worth over a million. - A million? Are you messing with me? - Dollars. In fact, we need one more member on the crew, and a four-door foreign car. In case you’re interested. Tell me, what’s all about? When they find out we’ve switched suitcases, we’ll be long gone. You’re a criminal mastermind, bro? Shake my hand, good man. We have a deal, bro. But here’s the thing: I want half of it. The other half you share with these losers. - Wait a minute, the plan is mine. How’s -- - Half part or the blondie. Have your hair cut, shave, get yourself a fancy black suit and a four-door car. Are you giving me orders, rascal? No. Cabeça, here's the deal: do you know how holding companies work? - Are you messing with me, man? - No, man. That’s what we’re doing now! Theoretically you're supposed to give 50% of the initial investment. No fucking way! Are you out of your mind? I’m not saying you must begin with 50% of the investment, especially because they owe you money and it counts as a deduction of investment, right? There’s also the suit, which doesn’t count as an investment-- OK, let’s cut the small talk, bro. You want a car and a suit. I’ll get them. But here’s the following: if anything goes wrong, everybody dies. Got it? Got it, Zulu? Let’s go, guys. Gui, this guy is very dangerous. - He could kill us to get the money. - You’re forgiven, OK? - What? - I understand why you lied to me. - No, Gui, please. - What’s with all this intimacy? “Gui” my ass! Give up on this idea. We’ll deal with Cabeça. I’m begging you. Are you crazy? Give up now? Can I ask you something? Trust me. Zulu, you know... The tribal metallic adhesive on your car. Tribal, or whatever it's called. Remove it. It’s tacky. Fuck you! Done. They’ll be deported. Any questions? The entrance. Where do I park the car? - Here and wait for us. - A bit ahead of the house. Not in front of the house so you won’t draw much attention. - Of course not! - Is there a suitcase in the library? No, the suitcases will be in front of the restrooms. The checkpoint will be here, OK? And they leave with the red suitcases here. We’ll arrest everybody that leaves. Agent Ribeiro is the operation head together with Priscila. OK? Now let’s work, guys. What’s up, old man? Back off! - Don’t touch me. - Back off! No one’s kidding here. It’s just the car. Let’s go! - You sure this is the man, right? - Yeah, that’s Cabeça. But be careful! This guy’s unpredictable, crazy. It’s too good to be true. Toast. This party looks promising! Now the country’s getting back on track. It sure will. - Hail Vieira! - Great Vieira. Next one is 35. 1.1 million. Number 29: 1.9 million. This one’s done, right? Please leave it there, Chico. You can go now. Thanks. Borges, you keep an eye on the suitcases, I’ll get the other ones. Despite the variables, the plan was easy to execute. Shredded paper in the red suitcase. The documents in the black one. My passport to freedom. In the blue one, the letter to the police. However much you’ve planned, when it comes the time for doing something for the first time in your life, it scares you to death. Especially if this given thing has no turning back. Keep an eye on your cell phone. You come and pick me up when I send you a message, right? - Got it, blondie. - That’s right. Leave the car running. Excuse me. - Mr. Vieira. - Hey! Move, agents. Fast! This is fucking tight. Fuck! Are we almost there? I’m fucking stuck in here. Quiet! - Hey, Zé Maria, what’s up? - New car, Mr. Guilherme? Yeah, I’m trying to keep up with the boss’s standards. It’s gonna work. I don’t wanna see you hooking up with Lara. - Do you hear me? - We’re in. I’ll kick your ass when we’re out. I’ll leave you here and cut you in little pieces. We’re coming in, Zulu. How long do I have to be in this shit? Hold your horses! The party hasn’t even started, bro! Good evening. Thank you. Water is great but champagne is even better. Thank you very much but I don’t drink. What a shame. Conversations are way funnier with a glass of champagne. - Later. Who knows? - I don't know your name. Excuse me. - Excuse me, Vieira. Shall we? - Excuse me. I can’t stay long. There’s a session in the Congress tomorrow before lunch. I’m leaving on the first flight. - Deputy? - Yes? I’ve done my job. I’ve done my job. I count on your vote tomorrow in Brasilia. You can count on me. - Have a safe journey, Deputy. - We’re together in this. Have a nice flight. - Are you alright? - Now, yes. - Yes? Shall we dance? - What? Dance with me, it’s part of the plan. You know what I wanted? To escape from here, from Cabeça, from Zulu, everything. - And go to Chile? - I’m sorry. That’s alright. If I hadn’t given you the money... I can’t even imagine what that guy would've done to you. I’m apologizing for something else. I shouldn’t have got off that bus. - You know, Vieira. - Yes, you showed me his picture. Remember the guy who talked to him afterwards? He’s going to receive a red suitcase. If Vieira sticks with you during the party, he's an asshole. We won’t be able to steal any suitcase. - Steal? - Exchange, actually. Wait, what is this plan? If anything goes wrong, Cabeça kills us. - He won’t. - He will. - He won’t. - Of course he will. - He’ll be arrested. - What? Arrested? - I got it all set up with the feds. - The cops? Easy. Pay attention, Lara. The original plan was to fool you and Zulu. - I can’t believe it. - The original plan, OK? You’d help me save my ass and would leave this place empty handed. Wait! You tricked me. - You tricked me first. - Is it a game? It was revenge, but I changed my mind. Chill out. I changed my mind. If you trust me, everything's gonna be fine. I promise, OK? OK? I promise everything’ll be fine. Sorry for what I’m about to do. What? No smoking in here, pal. The heck? We’re out in the open. I can even feel the breeze. If you wanna smoke, do it on the streets, please, pal. Black, blue or gray? Red, I want a red one. The red ones are for VIPs only. - So the gray one. - Sure. - They won't release the bag. - Yeah, I see. I think that guy will get one too. Good evening. Hey, dude, where are you? He went away. Shit. I’m at the door already. - Hoping it’s a red one. - Motherfucker. I voted for him. No, I’ll take it. Leave it. Help me open it. That's it. There, it’s a red one. Let’s go? Let’s go. Prepare the bait, Ribeiro. The first fish is coming. Move! You stay here. Yeah, it’s all right, Dr. Vieira. She’s got the luggage. I’m sorry! I’m so reckless! I was checking my phone. - Careful with your phone. - I know, right? Would you like a ride home? I’m staying a little longer. Thank you. Be careful with your luggage, deputy. - Get off the car, please. - What was it, guys? - The trunk. - There’s nothing wrong here. - Please, there's nothing wrong. - Nice! - Is it OK? - First one is done for. What are you gonna do? I’ve got a family. Good thing you’re still here. Where do you know that woman from? She’s one of Mr. Vieira’s guests. She wasn’t on the list. She got here last minute. It seems she's your guest. I’m the one controlling the red luggages for VIPs. Who invited you here? I can't recall. Did you get the luggage as a gift? - Let’s go, Lara. - What are you doing here? We’re gonna be screwed. You may take the girl. - But the bag stays. - Ask Mr. Vieira. He's talking to her. - No way! - The luggae is coming. Take your hands off of it and go away, bro. - Got the documents? - I did, but break in if you can. Cabeça’s here. Don’t hang up. Leave the luggage and go away. This way. Guilherme, where are you? By the buffet. On the back. - Excuse me. - On the right side. - Guilherme? - Chief Queiroz. Guilherme told me to give it to you. - Is it right? - How could you... Good evening. Cabeça is here. Don’t move! - Are you crazy? - Shackle him. His gun's here. On your feet. Let's go. I got you, Cabeça. Where do you think you’ll go with my money? - Come! - Let's go! Guilherme! O que é isso? Get the documents. Get them - Let's go! - Move, Guilherme. Motherfucker! Come! You know what will happen to your little daughter, motherfucker? Say it! Talk about her again. Guilherme, stop it! You’re not a criminal. This motherfucker is. Let’s go, get the luggage. Montanha, the accountant. Zé Maria, roger. Hey! What’s up, Zé Maria? - You have company, Mr. Guilherme. - Sure. I apologize. I forgot it was party day, but you know our rules. - Of course. - I’ll need to check the trunk. - Really? OK. - Be my guest. Party was great. But I got a lot of work to do tomorrow. Come, Zulu! Can you help me, please? OK, I’ll get my keys. - Babe, hand me the keys, please. - Of Course. Now go! Montanha, I got a situation! Talk to me, Montanha. Keep in mind the minister hates abuse of authority. He won’t like this, not even a bit. So, we better not even tell him, right? We did it! We're rich! What's that, bro? - Fucking go! - Calm down! - Speed it up! Go! - Go! Get out! Zulu, we'll crash! Stop it! It's over, forget it, there's nothing we can do! Easy, Lara! Close the fucking door! - I'm returning the papers. - Are you crazy? What papers? Papers my ass! I want the fucking money! Shut up, Zulu! Fuck! Your money is here, damn it! It's no use returning any document, they'll kill us either way. - Speed it up! - Fucking go! Fuck! - Go, Zulu. - Go that way! - Speed it up, Zulu! - Faster! This motherfucker hit the engine. The car’s losing its fucking power. Zulu... - This is Cabeça’s area, back up. - I know that. - Are you insane? - We're leaving. Trust me. - Open the window. - Fuck. Get the suitcase with the money. What’s up? What are you doing here, dude? Weren’t you supposed to be at the party? - Where’s Cabeça? - We’re screwed, man. Cabeça is coming right behind us with another suitcase full of money Here’s your cut. Toss them. What’s with this money here, man? Toss who? - Behind us! - What’s up? Get out! I told you! If it weren’t for your toy, we wouldn’t have made it. - Is everybody OK? - Yeah. - No one’s hurt, right? - No. Are you OK? This was madness. Here. I told you I’d pay, didn’t I? Interest included. I added up interest. Which prison? No, I yet don’t know where to go but I wanna go far from here. Far from this money. From Cabeça. From Zulu. - Hey, what’s going on? - Wait! - Wat the fuck? - Stop it, Zulu! Let me go! - Why are you doing it? - Let me go! Let her go. - Let her fucking go! - She's my woman. - My woman! - Zulu! Chill out. Easy, OK? Hear me? Why’s that? Why? He’s just saved your life. Get in the car. Are you crazy? You know what our problem is, Gui? We’re completely different. Totally. But that’s the fun part. Opposites attract, right? It’s a law of physics. Come with me. It’s a law of physics, not ours. Let's go. Let’s get out of here, Guilherme. We need to solve your problem early in the morning. What’s with that kiss? Tell me! It was a kiss... ... to say goodbye. You’re right. You’re forgiven. Don’t do this to me. Look at me. Let’s start over. You and I. I’m clean. Let’s have a family. A kid. I love you so much! This letter serves for nothing, Tadeu. No documents, no agreement. You’ll have all the documents, chief. My client has already given you on a silver platte a scheme with nearly all the people involved. How long would the Federal Police take to raise all this evidence? Ten years? Fifteen? Chief, you’re treating my client as a criminal. - And what is he? - A hero, chief. If we were in the USA, he'd get a medal, you know that. You're aware of that. And you know very well he’s not a criminal. As far as I know, your client has committed more than one crime, fled, and made us play the joker. Don't take it personal, chief. He did it to save his daughter’s life. Trust me. Call the judge. Leon Vieira, a defendant in the Party Crasher Operation, triggered by the Federal Police six months ago in Rio de Janeiro, is finally convicted. At the time, many were arrested in the act and 14 million dollars in cash were seized. Besides documents that proved his involvement. I can’t believe it! Again, Zulu? - Hey! - Careful, hottie. He sleeps just like you, with his hand over the head. He’s just fallen asleep. - Love you. - Love you too. Easy, sweetheart. Oh, gosh! Sweetie! Mom said you’d be late. Me? But I was dying to pick you up! You’re so tall, look at you! Wow! You look beautiful. I got here 40 minutes before the flight. Good. - Miss you. - I missed you so much. Let’s go home? - Let’s go home! - Let’s go home! The conclusion is that life is a huge chain reaction: the environment where you live, people who you live with, they bring experience, sensations and feelings and desire that influence your actions and will generate other reactions. So, the tip is: think well about your choices. They’re everything you have. [homem] E aí, gatinha? Hey, Cabeça, they’re here! Hey, boss! Check it? Hey, be quiet. Bring it here. Oh, senator, life goes on! I’m fine, and you? Everything's all right. Welcome to Federal Police, Tadeu. Thank you, chief. Up for a drink to celebrate it? - That’d be good. - Yeh.
