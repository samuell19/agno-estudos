-The court is open. -Yes, sir. Captain Leland, this court has considered your case... ...and reached its conclusions based on evidence... ...introduced while you were present. At the close of evidence, court was closed... ...and by secret ballot, in which two-thirds of the court concurred... ...the court reached its findings. Which are, of all specifications and of all charges, guilty. Then again, by secret ballot, in which at least two-thirds of the court concurred... ...the court decided your punishment. Which is that you be sentenced to dismissal from United States Army... ...and forfeit all pay and allowances due or to become due... ...subject to approval of the reviewing authority. -Any further business? -No, sir. Do l hear a motion for adjournment? -l move that the court adjourn. -l second the motion. Any objections? Apparently not. The court is adjourned to meet at the call of the president. How about a game, fellows? All right, Hanson. You and me against Greer and Parsons. l?ll take a cue. Well, captain... ...anything bothering you? Used to be a custom in the British army when a man disgraced his uniform. Too bad we can?t do it. Come in. Well, Rick? An officer shouldn?t associate with one who?s been dishonorably dismissed. The regulations say so. The adjutant gave his permission. ln spite of the evidence, l just can?t believe. Or if you did do it, you must have had a reason. One that you thought was important. Tell me. l?m your friend. lt?s all in the testimony. l could have loaned you the money, or part of it. And there were others who would have been glad. l just can?t believe. You, of everybody l know. Yeah, l guess nobody ever really knows anybody. What are you going to do, Rick? l?ll probably go up to Canada. -They need artillerymen there. -But, Rick.... Well, anyway, good luck. Thanks. Goodbye. Sit down. l see you?re an artilleryman, Mr. Leland. What is your experience, and with what type or ordnance? All types and calibers of both fixed and mobile coastal guns... ...including one year in an antiaircraft battery. Where were you stationed? Two years at Fort MacArthur, one year and eight months, Fort Totten... ...one and two months, Fort Kamehameha... ...four years in the Panama Canal Zone. Your full name? Richard Loomis Leland. -Richard Leland? -That?s right, sir. l?m sorry, Mr. Leland, but l believe at this time... ...we have a full compliment of coast artillery officers of all ranks. l thought the Canadian army needed men of experience. Oh, regardless of his qualifications, no one man is indispensable. Maybe Chiang Kai-shek won?t be so particular. l?m aware neither of the desperation of the generalissimo?s needs... ...nor how good are his sources of information. Good day, Mr. Leland. Your baggage checks, Ms. Marlow. The ship sails from Pier 1 9. Sailing time will be midnight, but passengers be aboard by 1 1 :00, please. Thank you. What was that boat you were talking about? The Genoa Maru, sailing tonight for Yokohama... ...by way of New York, the Panama Canal and Honolulu. -lt?s for me. -Excuse, please? How much? To port of final destination, $21 2.80. Excuse, please. l cannot promise passage on the Genoa Maru... ...unless we have cancellation. However, there is possibility. lf you will leave name and address, l shall inform you in time before sailing. -Well, when is the next sailing? -Next Wednesday. The Nakimura Maru. Bigger, more passenger space, same fare. Well, try to make it Genoa Maru. l?ll be packed and waiting. We trust we can be satisfactorily of service, Mr. Leland. -Good night, Mr. Leland. -Night. This is Mr. Leland speaking. The N.Y.K. steamship office call me? You?re sure? Well, thanks. Yes? Yeah. Yeah, speaking. The Genoa Maru it is, eh? Okay. You send the tickets over, and l?ll pay the messenger. Right. -Passenger? -Yes. Bags, should-a be. -What time do we sail? -Soon. Ten minutes or half-hour, should-a be. Should? -Leland Richard. -No, Richard Leland. Should-a be. -Bed hard? -lt?s very hard. Should-a be. My name Sugi. l think l?ll call you ??Should-a Be,?? if you don?t mind. Should-a be. For drink. Wash hand. Fan. For read. Anything else? We?re going to know each other eventually, so why not now? That seems reasonable enough. l?m Alberta Marlow. My name?s Rick Leland. Would you mind stepping into the light? Please. Well, on a Jap freighter too. You?d better pinch me. l don?t think l know you that well. A pretty girl on a boat with no college boys, no handsome officers... ...no eligible men of any description. That?s wonderful. You?ve traveled a lot? Some, but never so luxuriously. This is my first time on a big ship. Well, this is not a ship. This is a boat. ln Medicine Hat we wouldn?t know about such things. That where you come from? How far you going? Through the Panama Canal to Los Angeles and then back home by train. Vacation? l?ll try to make the trip as pleasant as possible. Thank you. -Good night, Mr. Leland. -Well, now, don?t go. Let?s go into the salon and talk. Sorry. Hope l?ll see you around again soon. We?ll probably bump into each other. -Good night. -Good night. -Thick night out. -Yes, sir. Can?t open the liquor until you get outside the 1 2-mile limit? That is so. -Silly rule, huh? -Yes, sir. -Excuse, please. Yes, sir. -Yes. -l presume you?re Mr. Leland. -That?s right. l?m Dr. Lorenz. Not much chance of mistaking one?s fellow voyagers on this passage. Not much. -May l inquire where you?re bound for? -The Orient. Excellent. l too. The Philippines, that is. l hold the chair of sociology at the university there. My man. He doesn?t speak English. That would be T. Oki of the passenger list? l take him everywhere. The Japanese make great servants. Will this be your first trip to the Orient? Never been further than Hawaii. lndeed? l?ve lived and worked in the Far East going on 30 years. Oh, that?s a long time. The Oriental way of life holds a great appeal for me. l?m going to take a turn about deck before retiring. -Would you care to join me? -That?s a good idea. -You?re an American, are you not? -Yes. Then you don?t share my enthusiasm for the Japanese. l don?t know. Never thought about them. Wonderful little people. Wonderful. Greatly misunderstood, believe me. To know them, that is... ...to really know them, is to feel the deepest affection toward them. l understand we have a charming young lady passenger aboard. Yes. A creature of rare loveliness, doctor. She walks in beauty. l?m a very, very happy man, but very. -Usually on a freighter-- -But not this one. A fellow couldn?t do half as well on a trans-Atlantic liner. l have no objection to your discussing me... ...but do you mind doing it farther off? l?m trying to sleep. You?re fortunate. Fortunate and young. Occasionally l wish l were young again. -Good night. -Good night, sir. -Good morning. -Mr. Leland. -l hope and trust you had a good night. -l don?t remember, so l must have. You missed something sleeping so late. We dropped the pilot. Well, what l came to see l didn?t miss. Are your legs always blue? -They?re not blue. -Should-a Be, give me that blanket. l don?t want a blanket. l want sunshine. Your teeth are chattering like a crap game. This is November, and it?s winter sunshine. -Thank you. -Well, it?s pure selfishness on my part. lf you catch pneumonia, what will happen to our romance? What will happen to it if you don?t shave? l shall enjoy listening to you two if you?ll permit me. You can referee. Relationships between modern young Americans... ...seem most peculiar to a man of my years. You give your lovemaking an assault-and-battery twist. Living in the Far East has given me a more or less Oriental view of things. We were discussing Philippine economics when we were interrupted. My own field. Ms. Marlow?s kind enough to listen to me. They?re going to be free, aren?t they? They are, provided America doesn?t insist on fighting a war with Japan. lt?s my opinion, however, that that contingency... ...is going to keep the Philippines from ever being free. Won?t Japan gobble them up? No offense, but Japan or Canada or anybody else can have the Philippines. lt?s hot in Manila. lt might be even hotter before long. Hot enough to go around in shorts? There?s a Canadian for you. Let them take their clothes off, and they?re happy. Look. An American warship. Yes, a 1 91 8 Flush Decker. Four four-inch .50-caliber guns, one three-inch .23-caliber antiaircraft gun. Not very formidable. Don?t you find that the United States is inclined to forget... ...that most of the world is at war already, with more war to come... ...perhaps in the Pacific? Well, if it comes, it will have to do without me. lndeed, Mr. Leland? You seem about the right age. l?ll see you later. Very interesting young man. Very. l don?t believe our captain will mind my explaining his words. What he just said means, ??Permit me to take.?? Something like saying grace before a meal. lt also expresses his thankfulness to his ancestors. That is right. Excuse, please. l like that. l come from a long line of grace-sayers. Excuse, please. Ms. Marlow, Mr. Leland, Chief Engineer Mitsuko. How do you do? Excuse, please. Chief engineer has no English. Chief engineer has a good grip. Some joke. No, l think l?ll skip the bread pudding. Just bring me some coffee. l hope you?re a good sailor, Ms. Marlow. The Genoa Maru has her moments when a blow comes on. -l wonder if it will really get rough. -This is rough. Not nearly enough. l wanna go through something l can talk about. Yes, well, you probably will, but you may not wanna talk about it. l think there?s something elemental in a storm. lt appeals more to women than men. They?re more elemental. -Than what? -Than women. -Men? -Than men. Yes, l hope so, honey. l?m your friend. Some joke. l suppose l shouldn?t smoke my cigar right now. No, let her be happy for a little while. A little while. Do you know what l?d like to do? To go up in the bow, if l had a man to hang on to. l?m your man. Anyplace, even the crow?s nest. Let?s go. -Better bring your coat. -Gentlemen. Oh, this is wonderful. What a figurehead you?d make. Look at the stern, the way it goes up and down. lt goes down so far, you?d think it would never come up again. -And look at the way the masts are going. -Well, don?t look too long. -Keep your eyes off the water below. -Oh, l feel wonderful. You are wonderful. l wish l had a better suit. lt doesn?t matter about the suit. You have a kind face. -You think so? -Yes, l do, Rick. -That?s the first time you called me Rick. -ls it? Yes. What?s the matter? Look, l didn?t mean that. l did. Why didn?t you? Well, a fellow with a suit like mine shouldn?t go around kissing girls. Hey, are you getting sick? l don?t know. How do girls usually act when you kiss them? -Well, they don?t turn green. -Then l?m sick. Get me out of here. And everything was going so beautifully. Why did you have to eat that bread pudding? Should-a Be. The lady?s been stabbed by a bread pudding. -Do want you can for her. -Bread pudding. Too bad. Should-a be. Mr. Leland. You beating it? Patience is a game one only plays out of boredom... ...which condition of mine it does nothing to relieve. -Will you have a drink with me? -Thanks. l will. Have another. l shouldn?t. l?m strapped. Sorry to hear that. But what possible bearing can that have? lf a fellow l?m counting on in New York doesn?t kick through... ...l won?t be able to buy you a drink. That doesn?t alarm me greatly. Ms. Marlow dying. Want to see Rick. Excuse me, l?ll be right back. -l understand you?re dying. -Yes. Do you want to be buried at sea? They stitch you up in a bag-- -No. -And you wouldn?t like that? -Then l?ll have Should-a Be put you on ice. -Very amusing, a woman suffering. Oh, stop being such a baby. Even if l do live, l?ll never be the same again. lt happens to everybody that eats bread pudding and looks at a mast. The mistake l made was in kissing you. -l was all right till then. -l resent that. l?ll never let you kiss me again. We won?t argue. You?re not well, and you don?t know what you?re saying. l do too. Stop that. Don?t tell me you?re the kind that goes to bed with your shoes on. l need them on for when l suddenly have to run down the hall. All right, darling. -l?ll humor you. -Humor me? When you?re sitting at the table tonight, eating your head off... ...think of the girl whose happiness you wrecked. -Yes, darling. -l pity the woman you ever marry. Oh, l?ll never get married. The kind of a lover l am, it wouldn?t be fair. Any wife of mine would spend her whole life running down hallways. -You aren?t married, are you, Rick? -No. Does that make you feel better? You make me sick. And if you stay here one minute longer, l?ll prove it to you. l take it our lovely traveling companion has a touch of mal de mer. lt was only a matter of time. She speeded things up by looking at the mast. -What a pity. -Yeah. She doesn?t look too well with a green face. From certain remarks you dropped on deck this morning, Mr. Leland... ...l gather you are quite well informed in matters pertaining to the U.S. Navy. Yes, l know a little bit about it. You were, perhaps, in the Navy? No. Coast artillery. Army. How interesting. Not so interesting. Were you ever stationed in Panama? Part of the time. l hope you don?t think l?m too inquisitive. Not at all. Not at all. You?re furnishing the liquor. That?s hardly an excuse for asking a man his history. l haven?t got any history. l was in the Army. l got kicked out. l went up to Canada and tried to enlist, they wouldn?t have me. -l can?t understand that. -lt?s simple. They don?t want men that have been kicked out of another army. You?re frank, anyhow. -l admire that quality. -Why shouldn?t l be? The so-called facts... ...are known in every army post in this hemisphere. l understand how you feel. But you can?t afford to be bitter against your own countrymen. -Particularly in these troubled times. -Can?t l? How do you know what l can afford? l?m sorry. l didn?t mean to intrude an unwanted opinion. Okay, doc. l?ll hire out to whoever will pay for my services. Chiang Kai-shek, Hirohito. Anybody who will pay. l can?t tell you how l sympathize with you. -Were you stationed long in the Canal Zone? -Quite a while. l served at Fort Amador and Fort Sherman. l was attached to staff. Amador guards the Pacific approach, doesn?t it? Yeah. -l think l?ve had too much to drink. -You?re ill? Can l help you, Mr. Leland? Sick? Need help? Go away. Tea? Hold the head? Beat it. -Too much whiskey. Very sick. Should-a be. -Beat it. This is the happiest moment of my life. My prayers have been answered. Close the door when you leave. They have a nice burial at sea. Go away, will you? l wanna die alone without a friend. You will. ls there anything l can do? Something to make you sicker? Just hang around. Keep your shoes on. l hope you?ll need them. -Rick, before l get off the gangplank-- -What? Are there any stray hayseeds in my hair? Now look, angel, l?ve gotta see a friend of mine. l think l can borrow some money. You wait here for me. -l?ll only be a few minutes. -Okay. Here you are, folks. Here you are. The collected ingenuity of the four corners of the Earth for a quarter. Twenty-five cents apiece. Every article is unconditionally guaranteed. lf they don?t work, bring them back. l won?t be here. Here?s something nice. Scare your friends. You won?t have many friends. What?s the matter? You taking root there? Step right up, folks. Twenty-five cents. One-quarter of a dollar. lt amuses the kiddies and amazes the old folks. Send you to the madhouse. Here you are, folks. Here you are. The collected ingenuity of the four corners of the Earth for a quarter. -Eighth floor. -Eight. -Eight, please. -Eight. Atlas Finance Company. -One moment, please. Yes, sir? -l?d like to see Mr. Hart. -May l have your name, please? -Leland. He?s expecting you. Go right in. Yes? -Well, glad to see you, Captain Leland. -Colonel Hart. -Sit down. -Thank you. Say, l had to duck a fellow on the way up here. White man. Tall and thin. Wore a long black overcoat and derby hat. l think l know the man. We may soon pay him a visit. -How did it go up north? -Everything went about as expected. But l must say that their rejection of my army application... ...was just a little bit on the insulting side. By the way, how did you manage to get me on the boat? Your story was told in the right quarters. Dr. Lorenz was well informed about you before you even came aboard. -Now, there?s a girl. -l know. We?ve been checking on her. But from what l hear, l don?t think she?s the type. -Would she be there if she weren?t? -Possibly, but l doubt it. However, that?s up to you to find out. What?s she like? Well, remember the girl you used to dream about when you were 1 9? Why, very well. -This is her in the flesh. -l see. Well, how are you and the doctor getting along? Famously, l?d say. Well, don?t take too much for granted. Lorenz is no chump, or he wouldn?t have lasted so long. He may be just giving you enough rope. Another thing, remember, on shipboard, anything can happen to a man. A box drops on your skull, a wave washes you overboard. l?ll be careful. You?re going to have a new shipmate. Getting aboard is a young man by the name of Totsuiko, Joe Totsuiko. A member of the Kokuryukai, and tough. A Jap gunsel. So watch out, if you bump into him. -Yeah, l?ll do that. -There?s one other item. The details of your disgrace have been widely circulated... ...in Panama and the Pacific. So you won?t be welcomed exactly with open arms. l?ll be on my own down there? Smith is expecting you. No one else knows. Some big things are brewing. We have reason to believe they?ll boil over. We don?t know how soon or what side of the pot... ...but they?ll involve the canal, and that?s where you come in. Because Lorenz may or may not be the key man. lt?s up to you to find out. -Success. -Thank you. l hope you and the girl l wanted to marry when l was 1 9... ...have a nice lunch together. -Goodbye, sir. -Goodbye. -Who?s your friend? -l don?t know. l hate to complain, but he?s been pretty nasty. -Yeah? About what? -The usual thing. -Do you want to meet this lady? -No. She was under the impression you wanted to talk. Not me. l guess l was just reciting something to myself. Why don?t you recite something to me? l don?t know what you?re talking about. l gotta get going. lt?s not polite to walk out on a lady like that. First, you say you?re sorry, then you say goodbye. l beg your pardon, lady. l mistook you for a girl who used to come in here and sit all the time. lt won?t happen again-- -Why didn?t you really hit him? Afraid? -No, he had my number. -Did you get your money? -Yeah, more than l expected. Did l talk fast. ln that case, you?re going to get yourself a new suit. This has been some day for a girl from Medicine Hat. ls that a gag, or do you really come from Medicine Hat? What?s wrong with Medicine Hat? Except it?s cold in winter and nothing happens there? You happened there. That?s enough for me. By any chance, are you a woman of means, by any chance, l hope? My father?s a farmer. l work in a 1 0-cent store. l sell peanut brittle. l see you whipped up the gaudy gown that you wear... ...on the family sewing machine. -l?m on your blacklist? -No, l?m used to bad luck. lt?ll probably end up with Captain Higoto marrying us. Oh, no. l want a church wedding and a groom who has more than two suits. How long were you in Panama, Rick? About four years. You ever hear of a man by the name of Morton? Dan Morton? Dan.... Yeah, he?s a planter, isn?t he? A lot of dough. Why? He?s related to some friends of mine. Look him up. He might take a fancy to you and leave you all his money. l?m not so obsessed with money as you seem to be. l can do without it. Well, you stick around with me and you?re going to get plenty of practice. We can walk, Rick. Save your money. This is no time to be a pinchpenny. l?m wooing a girl. Pier 1 6. Someone should tell our little friend that tight overcoats and guns don?t go together. He?s liable to get picked up by a cop. Pier 1 6. Well, if we?d known he was coming here, we could have given him a lift. What?s up, Rick? -You stay here. -You can?t dump me. -Something?s gonna happen. -Now, go back. Don?t be an innocent bystander. They always get hurt. -You all right, doc? -Yes. Do you know him? l don?t think so. At any rate, he isn?t a close friend. Okay, then we?d better send for the police. lf you don?t mind, l?d prefer that you didn?t. Miyuma. lf the police were called there might be an investigation. We might not be able to sail. lt?s none of my business what you do with him. He wasn?t shooting at me. l can?t thank you enough, Mr. Leland. Skip it, doctor. l was just coming onboard and practically stumbled over the guy. How you doing, angel? l think l got pushed in the face by somebody. -My-- My lipstick?s smeared. -You look cute. And now, if you?ll excuse me, l?ll go to my cabin... ...and faint. l hope no more of your homicidal friends are on the pier. Standing so close to you might be bad luck. First Officer Miyuma is taking care of that. -You weren?t kidding. -l suppose you?re wondering... ...about this little incident, Mr. Leland. -No, not particularly. -You know l?m a resident of the Philippines. ln fact, l consider myself a Philippine national. And what do the Filipinos consider you? lt?s unfortunate that some of my fellow citizens... ...resent my realistic attitude toward Japan. A few of them even go so far as to call me traitor. That misguided little man in the long overcoat... ...undoubtedly believed he was acting on patriotic principles. Whatever he believed, he believed pretty strongly. lf l were you, just from a health standpoint... ...l think l?d give up the Japs. l?m afraid my ties with the Japanese are rather too close for that. Financially, spiritually, ideologically and otherwise. lf those ties involve some personal danger, l don?t mind... ...considering the ultimate reward. lf you don?t mind, l shouldn?t either. l?m being frank with you because you saved my life. Naturally, anything l say is in confidence. Naturally. All that worries me is that l came on this trip for my health... ...but l seem to have come to the wrong place. Never saw such a gunned-up boat in my life. -Really? -Yes. Your little Filipino friend had a gun, Sugi?s got a gun... ...and that wasn?t an apple the first officer was holding in his pocket. You got a gun? Even l, Mr. Leland. Mine?s bigger than yours. l usually like to keep this locked up in my suitcase... ...but with all these guns around, what?s a fellow gonna do? l wouldn?t worry if l were you. l wouldn?t even think about it. Thanks for the tip. -Did you have a good time in New York? -Wonderful. Saw your man, got your money? l got it. Ms. Marlow made me spend it on a new suit. -lt?s very handsome. -Yes. She seemed to think it made some improvement. l?ll be hitting the hay. Anybody else starts throwing slugs at you, doc, don?t forget to duck. l believe l?ll be a little better prepared. Thank you. -Good night. -Good night. Hey. Am l nuts, or did l hear some shooting a few minutes ago? -Did l miss anything? -Firecrackers. Chinese New Year?s. Maybe l am nuts, but it sounded like those firecrackers... ...were shot from a muzzle. -My name?s Joe Totsuiko. -Rick Leland. l?m sure glad there?s someone around that speaks my language. l?m rooming with a dope named T. Oki. He?s got his lip buttoned up for good as far as l can figure out. -Where you bound for? -The Orient. Me too. My old man?s sending me down there to work for one of my uncles. Say, l wonder if those Panamanian mamas are all they?re cracked up to be. Terrific, Joe. Simply terrific. -Well, l?ll see you around, Ricky. -Yeah, take it easy, Joe. Without knocking, and where?s your modesty? -What?s going on? -Why, nothing?s going on. Not so loud. Well, that is, nothing except an attempted assassination. Why get so excited about a little thing like that? Who are you after? Are you a G-man or something? -What if l was? -l just wondered. Look, l?m just a private citizen, and l happened to be passing a room... ...where one guy was trying to bump off another guy... ...which, as you know, happens to be against the law. ??Happened to be passing.?? You followed our little friend... ...then lied to Lorenz about stumbling over him. But you can?t do that to me. lf it?ll make you happy, l?m J. Edgar Hoover. This is my badge. Some joke. A man should tell the woman he?s going to marry everything. Well, in that case, l?ll come clean. What? l look old, but that?s because l?ve worried a lot. l haven?t yet reached the age of legal consent... ...and if you don?t get out, l?ll yell for help. All right. You can get yourself another heiress. Powder, angel. And when you go, stop thinking and keep your mouth shut. Say, l never saw anybody like you. You never have any clothes on. lf anybody heard you complaining about it, they?d put you in the psychopathic ward. You birds of passage do not fight But help each other in your flight Japanese build their poetry like they do their houses. Read some more, Joe. Hey, you better turn over. This side?s done. Cherry blossoms at the well in danger are See drunken man l think l?ll get drunk. Your Occidental poet is wont to describe grand passions and heroic events. Not so with the Japanese. Their emotions are stirred by some tiny fragment of life... ...possessing the quality of beauty. This he would extract, reduce, distill, as it were... ...down to its purest essence. Then they do have emotions? l mean, like us. l mean, you?re always so calm. You never show anything. We are taught not to. lt is our way of life. We must not show too much sadness or too much joy. lf you praise what we have, we say it is nothing. lf you admire our sons, we must say they are unworthy. You?re most eloquent today, Captain Higoto. -Yes. -The Nisei aren?t quite so calm. Take me, for instance, kid. l?m a live wire. -What are Nisei? -Second-generation Japanese. Those born in the good old U.S.A. They represent a very small fraction, fortunately. -Hope there?s nothing personal in that, doc? -Oh, no. Excuse, please. Anybody wanna play shuffleboard? Not me, Joe. l?m sleepy. How about you, doc? Shuffleboard? Hardly. However, a game of gin rummy, perhaps? Boy, let me at them pasteboards. At last, we?re alone. Now, listen, bright eyes-- No romance. There?s something very interesting over there, Ricky. -Where? What do you mean? -T. Oki. lt?s not the same Oki that came down from Halifax with us. -That?s another man. -The heat?s getting you. -They all look alike. -No, they don?t. Not if you examine them closely. Did you notice how the first Oki stood? He stood with his head bowed and his shoulders bent. This man stands up straight with his shoulders back. The first Oki never put his hands in his pockets. This man keeps his in his coat pockets all the time. Take it easy, angel. Take it easy. You?re on your way to being a detective... ...but l wouldn?t see too much, or it might be your last case. -What do you mean? -You?re getting a bad burn, you know it? -l don?t feel like l am. -l?d go inside and put stuff on. Oh, it?s all right. Remember the bread pudding. Stick them up. l was only kidding, Oki. Don?t get sore. Some joke, huh? Mr. Leland. -May l come in? -Yeah. Come ahead. Well, who won the gin rummy? As Mr. Totsuiko put it, l was skunked four times. -Sit down. -Thanks. -Have a drink, doc? -Thank you. Amusing fellow, Joe. Quite. A little of him goes a long way. -To your health. -No, to yours. -Younger men have more to live for. -Well, that is if they?re lucky. lt?s been my experience, one has to be smart to be lucky. Then l hope l?ll be smart. l?m interested in you, Mr. Leland. Especially since you saved my life. You?re too modest. Look, if you feel that calls for some dough-- That isn?t my idea, though it might be worth some help. Such as? One night, you told me about your troubles in the Army. l?d like to hear more about that. l got in a jam with a dame. Yes? l needed some dough. l had access to the regimental funds... ...so l borrowed it, intending to put it back, of course. -Of course. -But they found out first. The brass hats could?ve given me a chance if they?d wanted, but they didn?t. They tied me up with pink ribbons and threw me to the wolves. You can write your own finish. Whatever that is to be, you?ll need some money. You can have more when you want it, within reason, of course. What?s my part of the deal? l never discuss being a traitor with a man. You?ll find it easier if you don?t think about that part of it. -Go ahead. -Very well. ln a day or two, you?ll talk to me about certain installations... ...in the vicinity of both Balboa and Cristobal... ...with particular reference to antiaircraft emplacements... ...railway guns and ammunition dumps. All you have to do is to remember accurately. That ought to be worth quite a lot. You?ll find me quite generous. You?re not only interesting to me now, you?re also valuable. But that shouldn?t cause you any anxiety. Do you mind if it does? lf.... lf you were to apply for life insurance, stating all the facts... ...the company?s actuaries might decide... ...there were certain imponderables existent in your position. For instance, having committed yourself... ...l wouldn?t want you to change your mind. lt might turn out to be most unfortunate. All right. Remember what l said, Mr. Leland. About it being easier not to entertain certain thoughts. Ms. Marlow burning up. She say please come quick, put out fire. Should-a Be. Oh, boy, oh, boy. Well.... You certainly are a girl of many colors. First your legs get blue, then your face turns green... ...now you?re red all over. l never knew what suffering was until l came on this pleasure trip. Your trouble is, you know all the answers till the results are posted. l knew you couldn?t resist at least one ??l told you so.?? lt?s true. Seeing me in pain does give you pleasure. -No, precious, it isn?t that. -Then what are you so happy about? Well, l just got some money from Dr. Lorenz for saving his life. Rick, you didn?t actually take money for saving a man?s life? ls there any other reason you know of why l should take money from Dr. Lorenz? But Rick.... Oh, Rick, you?re not much account, are you? l think l?ll make a career out of saving lives. Listen, precious, if that bothers you so much... ...you?re in for a real shock when we get to Panama. How? Well, you?re going to hear some things about me that aren?t very nice. What kind of things? l believe l?ll leave that to the people who?ll get fun out of telling you. Will what they tell me be true? Yes. Then l won?t listen. Now l know you didn?t come from Medicine Hat. -What?s all that about? -Judo is more than a mere contest. lts devotees form a brotherhood. Similar, in many respects, to our Western freemasonry. lt, too, has its degrees and its secrets... ...as well as its religious, or should l say, philosophical background. Come again? lt?s an Oriental concept that destructive force acts upon itself. And there you have the principle of jujitsu. To turn the power of one?s antagonist upon himself... ...and by so doing, vanquish him. That?s the art of the thing. How would all that stack up against a right cross? Throw one at me, Rick. -What? -Go ahead, throw one at me. -You mean that, Joe? -Sure l mean it. Sock me one. All right, you asked for it. Better get rid of those glasses. Oh, Rick. No hard feelings? -Unfortunate. Most unfortunate. -Something wrong, doctor? The canal is being put into repair... ...so far as ships flying Japanese colors are concerned. -This ship can?t go through? -Precisely. lt?ll have to sail around the Horn. We shall be forced to get off at Cristobal and await another boat. Unless we are prepared to add another 60 or 90 days to our voyage... ...which l most certainly am not. So sorry to cause you this inconvenience. Excuse, please. Money will be refunded, of course. Where will you stay, Mr. Leland? The Pan-American. Very quiet and respectable. -That ain?t for me. -Where you going? l?ll have to find someplace where they have a 40-cent lunch. l know the guy that owns the Pan-American. He?ll give you a rate. -Perhaps l?ll try the Pan-American. -l hate to recommend places. l?m sure our tastes will be similar. l see l ain?t got any folks to meet me. -Can l give you some directions? -No, thanks, Rick. l?ll find my way. lt?s been nice knowing you kids. l?ll be seeing you one of these days. Keep your dukes up. Sayonara, captain. -Goodbye, captain. Thank you. -Goodbye. Here you are. Thank you. You see a big wave coming, cap, don?t forget to duck. -Five dollars? -Forget it. l?m a rich man. Goodbye, captain. l do not know, but l think l might have saved Dr. Lorenz some trouble on my boat. l think he will have very bad luck with you. Skipper, everybody has bad luck with me. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Hello, Leland. What are you doing back here? You ought to have more sense than to come back. -lt?s a free country, isn?t it? -lt sure is, for guys like you. Sam, this is Ms. Marlow and Dr. Lorenz. Very nice you come here. Pan-American need beauty. Sam, this lady is very poor-- -Don?t mind my parading your poverty? -Not if it does the trick. --and l told her that l had a pull with you. -Can you take care of her cheap? -Can do. l would like a room with northern exposure, if you please. All same floor, all close together. Your room not quite ready. Maybe so have tea while wait. Maybe so. l?ll be right along. Office. -What?s the matter you, Rick? -What?s the matter me, Sam? All the time people say you no good. Big smell from up north. What?s the matter you come back? Too much Army here. Everyone know. You through with Panama. Panama through with you. Well, Sam, maybe l won?t be here long. Maybe so you need money go other place. No, Sam, l don?t need money. You no need money? Sam smell big fish. Sam keep nose clean, Sam no smell fish, no catchee trouble. All the time you like trouble. Maybe so Dr. Lorenz trouble? -Maybe so. -Girl too? l don?t know, Sam. l hope she?s all right. She got you bad. Much trouble. All the time much trouble. Sam... ...you can help me. People tell you things. People tell me because l don?t tell. l tell, they don?t tell me anymore. Okay, Sam. lf you don?t wanna help me, you don?t have to. -Can do. -l knew you would, Sam. Thanks. Be careful. lf l get any more careful, l won?t be any good. Much trouble. All the time much trouble. Key, sir. Room 24. Thanks. Hey. Thanks, se?or. Mr. Leland. -May l pay you a visit? -Yeah, sure. Come on in. -lt?s hot. -Very. lce water, room 24, please. Well, doc, what?s on your mind? Now that we?re in Panama, l think it?s time you began to earn your money. lt?s hot. Okay, doc. Where do we begin? Pedro Miguel Locks will be a good place for a starter. How many batteries are there? What are their caliber? Antiaircraft or heavy stuff? Begin with the 1 6-inch guns. Well, let?s see, the last time l was down here, two years ago... ...there were double railway guns east and west... ...two twin concrete embrasures half a mile to the north... ...one four-gun turret of shore-mounted Navy?s back of Hill 1 4. But what?s the idea? You know all that already. -Testing me, eh? -You examined the money l gave you? That?s right. Do we go on? We go on. What specific knowledge have you... ...of the military plane patrol over the canal area? Well, two years ago-- What happened two years ago doesn?t interest me. l want the current schedule of the patrol planes. When the flights take off, exactly what areas they cover... ...what altitude they conduct their reconnaissance... ...and the precise time of their return. lce water, sir. Now, that?s gonna take some getting. -l?ll pay generously for it. -How much? -Shall we say $500? -Shall we say $ 1 500? l said l?ll pay generously, not foolishly. Now, just a minute. Only place l can get that is Air Force headquarters. That won?t be easy. May take almost a week of trying before things begin to break right. l?ll make you a deal. Fifteen hundred if you get it by 5:00 today. Five o?clock? Why all the rush? -There?s no rush. -Just $ 1 000 worth? Remember, Mr. Leland, it?s your place to answer questions, not to ask them. Sorry, l-- l?m a little new at this game. Of course, of course. Oh, and by the way, don?t get the ingenious idea... ...of selling me out to the American authorities. lt wouldn?t pay in the long run. Wait a minute. -Who is it? -lt?s me. -How you doing? -All right. -You happy? -Very. -What?s the program? -l?m free as a bird. l got a couple of things to do. Meet you at the lnternational Bar at 1 :00. -How do l get there? -Tell any cab driver. Come as you are. -What can l do for you, sir? -l want to open an account. -Sit down, please. -Thank you. -Savings or checking? -Savings. And what is the name? Leland. Richard Leland. Will you sign there, please? There you are. How much did you wish to deposit? One thousand two hundred and forty-one dollars. No one can get close enough to hear us without our seeing them. Go ahead with your report, Captain Leland. Lorenz is hooked. l?m on his payroll, $350 worth. He must think you?re very valuable. What have you got? Not much. Lorenz seems to be head man. They switched his valet in New York. The new T. Oki could be a Naval Officer. He is. Have you any idea what Lorenz is up to? No, but l?ve got a hunch that whatever?s going to happen will happen soon. He offered me the family jewels for the canal-patrol flight schedule... ...and he wants it quick. -We could hardly afford-- -Worth the gamble to keep his confidence. -We could make up a fake schedule. -Yes, we could. All he?d have to do is get a pair of binoculars and a watch... ...to find out he?d been tricked. We better give him the real dope. l?ll phone you if things get to looking dirty, and you can always change the schedule. Very well. Under the circumstances, l suppose it wouldn?t be too dangerous. They?d hardly keep those men in Washington if they intended to pull a fast one. Should-a Be. Now, about the schedule. Oh, yes. l?ll have a copy of the schedule at your hotel this afternoon. Any more dope about the girl from Medicine Hat? She never lived there. She?s a New Yorker. A buyer for Rogers Fifth Avenue. She?s made eight trips abroad in the last two years. Of course, that could be part of her work. Well... ...l guess that slams the door on Ms. Marlow. lt?s a funny thing, though. She pointed out the Oki switch to me. Sometimes the best way to gain a confidence is to give one. What have you got on a Dan Morton? Owns a plantation here called Bountiful. Pardon me. Age, 55 to 60. Came here in ?31 . Heavy drinker. Bit of a dipsomaniac. Maybe a little cracked. His plantation has been profitable. Has substantial accounts in three banks. Apparently, no entanglements, either political or feminine. -Why do you ask? -She asked me about him. Said people in Halifax told her to look him up. l don?t believe anyone with as much money as Dan Morton... ...would bother with the small profit that treason pays. And he?s hardly the type to go in for the excitement. However, you never can tell. And now, l think you?ve been here long enough, captain. l?ll check with you later. You send the schedule over to my hotel at 5:00. Of course you?ll phone me at the first suspicion they?re making use of it. -And your book, captain. -Of course. -Thank you very much, Mr. Smith. -Good day, sir. l?m sorry to be late, angel. l was held up. Oh, l like waiting for you, Ricky. Wouldn?t l make a splendid wife? -What?ll it be? -Something cool and long. Something cool and long. How about a couple of planter?s punches? Fine. Rick, l had the funniest feeling coming over here. l felt as though l were being followed. A cab stayed right behind mine all the way over from the hotel. l may be imagining things, but l don?t think so. Who do you think would follow you? l wouldn?t know. Would you? All that funny business on the boat, what did it mean, Rick? Who is Dr. Lorenz and what is he up to? You?re good, angel. You?re very, very good. Don?t you think it?s time we got together on a few things? -Such as? -Who we are and what we are. l?ve told you everything about me. Now, look, angel, we can play this dumb or play it smart. l?m in this for what l can get, and l don?t think l?m getting enough. Now, we can make Lorenz pay off plenty if we throw in together. -l don?t know what you?re talking about. -Come off it. l don?t know how you got in with Lorenz? crowd, but you?re in it. l didn?t know Lorenz had a crowd. Oh, yes, l forgot. You?re the little lady from Medicine Hat. lt was your twin sister who was the buyer for Rogers Fifth Avenue. Couldn?t be she held that job so she could conveniently take trips abroad, could it? Let?s see, how many did she make two years ago? Three, wasn?t it? You must?ve gone to a lot of trouble to find all this. Sometimes it pays to go to a lot of trouble. l don?t know what you?re thinking, but whatever it is, you?re mistaken. Yes? ln what way am l mistaken? -All right, Rick, l?ll tell you. -Well, well, well. The happiness kids. -Hello, Joe. -Hello, Joe. ??Pull up a chair, Joe.?? Thanks, l will. What?s that you?re knocking yourselves out with? Hey, waiter, l?ll have one of those. Well, how are we doing? -All right until this moment. -l?m cramping your style? -Ms. Marlow? -Oh, l?m Ms. Marlow. -A telephone call. -That?s funny. Who could it be? Well, it?s easy enough to find out. This way, please. You know what l think l?ll do? Take the train into Panama City and catch a coastline freighter. Next boat is three or four days from now. lt?s a Chinese boat, and l?m not so keen on taking a Chinese boat... ...so l figure l?ll be saving time if l catch a coastline freighter to San Francisco... ...and make new connections there. -What do you figure on doing? -Me? l-- l don?t know yet. Why don?t you string along with me? We could share a cabin. -That?s not a bad idea, except-- -Oh, l get it. The little lady. Can?t say l blame you. She sure is a swell dish. Too bad about the Genoa Maru not being let through. She wasn?t a bad ship... ...even though you did grab the only dame onboard. l gotta hand it to you, Rick... ...you sure are a fast worker if there ever was one. -Ms. Marlow, did she go? -S?, se?or, just now. -The party that called, any name? -No, se?or. -Anything the matter, Rick? -No, no, not a thing. Where?d she go? Oh, l get it. Joe, do me a favor, will you? lf she comes back within 1 0 minutes... ...ask her to phone the hotel, let me know where she?ll be. -You take care of the check. -Sure thing, Rick. Mr. Leland? -Has Ms. Marlow come back? -No. There?s something for you. -Dr. Lorenz? -Upstair. -Any calls for him? -No call. Hey, Sam, give me a passkey, will you? Can do. lf she gets back, ring twice, her room. Will do. -Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Leland. -Oh, that?s all right. Has your search revealed anything? Yes. You?d be surprised how little girls wear these days. l was shocked. lt?s 5:05, Mr. Leland. l believe you said 5:00. You?re a little fast, but anyway.... l would consider it prudent if you would cease your attentions to Ms. Marlow. -Why so, doc? -Your interest in her... ...is unqualifiedly romantic, is it not, Mr. Leland? Between the two of us, doctor, l?m nuts about the lady. l suggest that you find a safer romance. Something more permanent. And now, Mr. Leland, the schedule. -Look, doc-- -That is it in the envelope, Mr. Leland? Oh, yes. That?s it, all right. -Fifteen hundred. -Now, hold on. l know l said 1 500, but it cost me that much. Almost, anyway. -l?ll only get a few bucks out of it. -That?s your business. -My business is to take care of myself. -How much more? -Let?s say 500. -Very well. Bear in mind, Mr. Leland, that such extraordinary procedure... ...doesn?t dispose me towards further dealings with you. You?ve got me all wrong. lt isn?t that l don?t wanna play ball. For all l know, you?ll hand me the 1 500 and wave goodbye. l?ll be left out in the cold with nothing to show for it. lf l were on the inside of things-- l shall have to make out a check for the 500, Mr. Leland. -Then it is a kiss off? -For the moment, yes. -Perhaps in time to come-- -l?ve got another proposition. Sorry, not interested. No checks, doc. l?m a cash-and-carry man. But, Mr. Leland, it?s after 5:00. The banks are closed. -l?ll never be able to get any such sum. -Well, then it?s no dice. As you say, sir. Remember, mine?s bigger than yours. You overestimate your value to us, Mr. Leland. Actually, we have on file any information you can give us. lt?s merely that we like to check and recheck such data. ln other words, your services were never at any time indispensable. Come off it, doc. -Oh, you doubt me, Mr. Leland? -No offense. l?m checking out. Have my bill ready. Send up a boy for the bags. You?re leaving, doc? l must continue my journey. Goodbye and good luck, in spite of our little difference. By Jove, l think you mean it. Mean what, sir? What you said about not needing this. Dispose of it as you will, Mr. Leland. Okay, doc, you win. l was only bluffing. -Let?s see the color of your money. -But l was not bluffing. The deal is off. Oh, don?t be that way, doc. After all, l did save your life once. You?ll never know how fortunately that circumstance has operated for you. Give me a break, doc. -How much? -Fifteen hundred. A thousand it is. l guess l deserve it. -Who is it? -Bellboy, se?or. Come in. Give me Colon 893. Hello. Can l talk to Mr. Smith? Smith? -This is Leland. -Yes, Mr. Leland, what is it? l was unable to contact you. l?ve been out all evening. Now, listen... ...our plans must be changed. You understand? Our plans must be changed. Can you take care of that? l shall take care of it immediately. Thank you very much. Number, please? Number, please? What?s the matter you, Rick? Where you been? How you get your head-bump trouble? My pal Dr. Lorenz. Pretty, eh, Sam? Dr. Lorenz go 5:1 5 in private car. That license number, no good. Stolen plate. -What about Ms. Marlow? -She no come back. -Much trouble. -You said it, Sam. You like movie show, maybe? Go Ewa Theatre. Buy ticket, 1 0:00. -What?s up, Sam? -Much trouble. -You got a gun? -Can do. Order automobile for front. Much trouble. -Thanks, Sam. -Much trouble all the time. -Stick around. -Yeah. Bountiful Plantation. Go Bountiful Plantation, fat man there. Go quick. Bountiful Plantation. Let?s get away from here fast. How much further is the house? Two, three miles. You better turn your lights off. Keep your lights off until you get a mile or two back down the road. No move. Up hands. Rick. Mr. Leland, l am surprised. lndeed, l am. But that?s the way with you. You?re always furnishing surprises. Come in, sir. Join our little family. -Hello, Rick. -Hi, Joe. Some joke, eh? Have a seat. Astounding recuperative powers you possess, Mr. Leland. Or should l say, Captain Leland? Amazing animal energy. The average man, given the punishment you received... ...would be flat on his back for at least a week. lt comes from living a clean life, doc. l hope you saw what you came to see, sir. Yeah. Looks like you boys are planning to knock over the canal. You said it. When those 8-foot torpedoes hit the Gat?n Locks... ...it?ll make the Johnstown flood look like something that happened in a bathroom. Don?t be too sure. Maybe your plane will never reach the Locks. Maybe you overlooked something. Could you suggest anything, sir, that we might have overlooked? What about your getaway? We have a rendezvous with an undersea boat. l think you?ll discover, captain, that nothing... ...absolutely nothing, has been left to chance. Maybe you?re right, doc. lt seems you are. You mind telling me how you got the plane and torpedo parts into the Canal Zone area? Not at all. Piece by piece and bit by bit. We brought them in cases of otherwise innocent farm equipment... ...addressed to D. Morton, Bountiful Plantation. -D. Morton? -Mr. Marlow, alias D. Morton. Her father. Where do you figure in all this? l don?t, Rick. l never did. l told you that, remember? l didn?t know what was going on here. l felt something was wrong. His letters were so strange. l wrote him that l would come down. He said l shouldn?t, l might be followed. Then l got a telegram to go to Halifax and take the Genoa Maru. l was going to tell you when l got the telephone call. lt was Father. He said to come quickly and to make sure that l wasn?t followed. That?s why l left the way l did. Nice timing, doc. l take my hat off to you. Thank you, sir. Americans are famous for good sportsmanship. Tell me, captain, would your attitude remain the same-- lmpersonal, objective. --were you to know that Smith, Mr. A.V. Smith... ...was unable to act on your last words? -Stay put, Rick. -l see the knowledge does affect you. lt?s nothing, captain, nothing at all. They?re only tuning up the motors. We have a few minutes yet. You?d better sit down, Rick. What do you want? l will.... Pathetic, is he not, sir? This rugged individual. Look at him. Eyes without focus, flesh without feeling... ...lips with no tongue, utter decay. He stinks. Mr. Marlow is a thief. A lazy, comfortable, drunken thief. He absconded with his company?s funds. Escaped to Panama with his loot, assumed another identity. Felt conscience-stricken. Mr. Marlow?s dipsomania enabled us to introduce our nationals into his employ... ...under the guise of workers and servants. ln due time, he became a prisoner on, rather than the master of, this plantation. Get up. Get up. His lmperial Highness, the Prince Kazuo Takamitsu lnoue. Yeah, we?ve met before. You the pilot, Oki? His Highness asked permission from the emperor to perform this mission. As you see, Captain Leland, l, too, was only kidding. We have no wish to kill you, Captain Leland, unless.... Okay, doc, l?ll be good. Joe. You can sit down now, folks. Nobody?s going anywhere. You guys been looking for a war, haven?t you? That?s right, Rick. That?s why we?re starting it. You may start it, Joe, but we?ll finish it. We?ll see, Rick. Don?t get nervous, Rick. l might lose control of this. You know something, angel? -What? -l wish you?d stayed in Medicine Hat. Rick! Rick. Rick. Well, now, take it easy, angel. -Have you seen Lorenz? -Yes, he was running towards the house. Go ahead. What?s the matter, doc, haven?t you got the nerve? You?re a soldier, sir. l appeal to you. Bullet, here. Some other time. l ask you again. -Do me the honor. -No, l can?t do it. You?ve got a date with Army lntelligence. Come on, doc. You know, you?re a great disappointment to me... ...after that big speech you made about weakness and decay. Right on time, eh, doc? Any of your friends in Tokyo have trouble committing hara-kiri... ...those boys will be glad to help them out. Right down there. Well, angel? [ENGLlSH]
