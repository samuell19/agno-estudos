Hey, hey! It's quarter past six and all is well in Shale City, Colorado. Ladies and gentlemen, Paramount is proud to present to you: THE REMARKABLE ANDREW Novel and adaptation: Produced by: Directed by: That's it, I'm done. Andrew Long a�n vive en Shale City and some of his neighbors still don't want to hear his name. No, this cyclist is not Andrew, we will see it later. There are many things that people do not understand. Take Einstein's theory for example, taxes, or even love: do you understand? Neither do I. However they exist, they happen... this is how the strange adventure of Andrew Long happened. If you've ever been caught talking to yourself, you'll understand. Or if... Wait a minute, here's Andrew. It all started a long time ago, on this morning of June 2, 1941. A single man with value is a majority A life on the waves of the ocean A house in the beach Where the waters break into foam And where the easterly winds are in your air... �Hola! - Good morning, Mrs. Grondos. - Good morning, Andrew. Good morning, Peg... - Buenos d�as, Andrew. - Jake. You're going to end up being late. - How are you? - Tired. - You should go to bed earlier. - I went out last night. - Did you have a lot of fun? - Yes. - Hello Joe. - Hi Andrew. Peggy. Don't you ask me who I went out with? Yes... Well, if you want to tell me. Randall Stevens. �Ah, �l! Don't say it in that tone! He is the best dancer in town. With the time you spend... - He asked for my hand. - Really? Do you intend to marry someone like you? Don't you ask me what I answered? That it was impossible because you were going to marry me. Exactly. He doesn't understand why we don't get married instead of talking about it endlessly. That is none of your business. As soon as I get my raise, we'll get married. Of course, but that seems so far away... - Many people get married... - And many get divorced A good businessman does not sign until he is sure of himself, however any idiot is ready to marry without knowing if he will be able to assume life as a couple. I do not. Haven't you forgotten the dance tonight? - The dance? - The Country Club dance. No, how could I forget? You are able. Today I must verify the municipal accounts for the annual exercise. But don't worry, I'll be there on time. There will be no problem, right? Keep you in the office. No problems! Not an error for 3 years. If anything happened, I would never forgive you. I said I'll be there. I'm going to break my fourth record and we'll dance all night. - Good morning, Randall. - Good morning. - Thanks for getting Peggy out. - Aren't you upset? Not at all, why? - If she were my fiancée... - You'd have reason to be. Wish me good luck with the accounts. Good luck. - Sr. Bricker. - Andrew. Buenos d�as, Sr. Grant. Martha. Hello, Harry. Hi Jim. - Good morning, Miss Halsey. - Good morning, Mr. Long. - Good morning, Miss Van Buren. - Nice day, right? Perfect. Excellent. Why is there a lot of work? Yes. Today I do the balance of the fiscal year. Decide what is fair... that is the meaning of the law. It is timed every year. He makes a race against himself. If it started before eight, I'd be cheating. To give more emotion you could start a minute later. It's not your style. - Did you win? - Fifteen minutes less than last year. And now you are going to give yourself a medal? I simply have the satisfaction of having finished a little faster. Do not take it badly. It's like a game with myself whose objective is to prove that two and two are four. seems obvious but he cannot imagine how they want to be five. Buenos d�as, Sr. Slocumb. The noise is over, have you finished yet? And the balance? I haven't verified it yet but surely yes. �Faltan 1240 d�lares! I don't get it! I dont believe it. He must have missed a line going so fast. I always go fast, sir, and I never make mistakes. - But I will find the mistake. - Yes, and take your time. Sam Savage, compras. I don't care what bar he's in, go find him. Look! Three checks have been torn out at the end of the book. I know. I've seen Sam Savage. He forgot to tell us. You know how it is when you've had too much to drink. But does that check? The account statements? Sam got them before you did. He is very nervous. The material was not compliant. That is, fill only the arrays. First to the order of... Robert Ambrose Inc. Denver. 225 d�lares. The second also for him, 650 d�lares. Same for the third 365 d�lares. - Invoice numbers? - I'll pass them on later. - Agree. Reason? - Reason? The purchased material. Construction materials, repair. Write that down. Sam will give you the details later. Investigate three checks for Robert Ambrose Inc. It is better to leave this life before virtue and honesty. - Can't balance. - Why? Because that $1,240 is missing from the general account - and not in the fire department. - Is the same. Everything is fine. Your job is to take stock, and you're done. No. What do you call this? I am seeing it with my eyes. So much here, so much there. Perfect balance. I can't forget the balance until it's cleared up. Forget it and let me take care of it. - Impossible. - Why? Because I am the accountant. - Tell me, who pays you? - Taxpayers Do you want taxpayers to replace you? - Is he a threat? - No. But forget this story. Can not. Excuse my bad temper, little one. You're saving to get married, don't throw it all away. You have a good job and I really appreciate your work. Good afternoon Art. Good afternoon Andrew. Have you finished? Yes. The account is fine. Okay, give me that. I'll take a look at it tonight. Let everything be ready for tomorrow's council. Impossible, Mr. McCall. The result is wrong. He's crazy! A very small detail in the Purchasing department, but nothing serious. I assume all responsibility. That's not enough. It is my responsibility. I am the one who manages the big book, it is my figures that the council will examine. And they are false. I appreciate your zeal. But you can trust Mr. Slocumb's commitment. And I'm the responsible treasurer, don't worry. I do not worry about myself, but about the accounts. If you want to present this balance as is, I will report it to the city council. Put your nerves aside and direct your steps to the right path. I'm suspending you while your accounts are reviewed. Good afternoon. Andrew, �llegas tarde! I'm sorry Peggy. I'm going to hurry. You should be ready by now. Me... Is there something that does not work. It's almost seven you're never that late. - Peggy, you see... - Don't make last-minute excuses. I knew that happening at this hour, I could see you without combing. �Nada m�s? No. Before the dance, I wanted to tell you how much I like you. Go on. And how lucky I am to have you. Yes, go on. And propose... Now go away. And don't be late. I'll be here in half an hour. A single man with value, is a majority Enough already, little one! Don't stay like this. I beg your pardon, sir. That is... You guys... You are General Jackson! Of course! Andrew Jackson. Yes, of course. I thought you... had passed away. Deceased, and a ham! Dead! I understand that it was difficult for you to recognize me. A very bad portrait. It belonged to your grandfather Ezdra! Yes. Ezdra Long was my great-great-grandfather. Did your grandfather die three times? How time flies! Happy soldier, Ezdra. Good fighter... Aren't you going to offer me a chair and a drink? Yes, of course! Si�ntese. - Please. - Thanks. That's better. Well? Oh yeah, the drink. I have excellent grape juice. Would you like a little ice? �Est�s loco? �Whisky! �Whisky? There's a store next door. You mean you don't have here? - Well, I,... - It's very strange. Go get a bottle. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Since you're going to look, take Rye. Maryland Rye. I haven't had a drink since I took off my shorts. - Good evening, Andrew. - Good evening, Johnny. How are you? - Sorry, Eddie. - It's no big deal. - �Jake! - �Qu�? �Tienes whisky Maryland? Listen Andrew... - You never drink. - Tell me only if you have. - Of course, but... - Give me a bottle, quickly. How much? �Half liter As you like. Better a liter. That's it, a liter. Okay, but I can't do anything if... “Give me the price, Jake! Can I make a phone call? You are in your house. - Good evening, Peggy. - Good night, honey. - I... - What? I can't go to the dance. I have visits �Qui�n? One visit, that's all. ok, but who I can't tell you, sorry. Why can't you? you wouldn't understand I'll explain it to you later. I love you Peggy. - �Cu�nto? - 4,85 d�lares. �4,85! My God! Put it on my account. BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE COUNTS - Have you found? - Yes. One moment, sir. Wait, little one. let me love For all the saints! It's from the good. This warms up after a good canter. Do you not drink? Here, have some. No, thanks. Me... I've been working a lot these days and... I have problems in the office. I know. That's why I'm here. �Perd�n? Which is why I'm here. Are you deaf or what? No, I just don't understand... That's very kind of you, but it's such a hassle. Not at all! Listen, you I don't know what grandpa saved my life. When he entered the White House, he wrote to me. "General... "I ask you to take care of my children." Well here I am. Si�ntate, peque�o. And give me your version of the facts. It all started with the balance of the annual exercise. Do you want to help me take off my boots? They hurt me! I haven't taken them off for ages. No, not like that. Turn around. Get on my leg backwards. That's it. Now... �Tira! Perfect. Under the bed. The other now. Thanks, little one. �Y? Someone has dug into the municipal treasury And he wants me to cover it up with fake numbers. What scoundrels! Be careful, they are not listening to us! If I could, I would give them what Henry Clay would have deserved. �To know? �Ahorcarlos! Show me a politician 4 meters above the ground, and by my beard, that I will be an honest man. - Who is it? - I don't know. - Are you waiting for someone? - No. And you? No. - Open? - We are not in any hiding place! Wait! Skip the introductions. If they no longer understood me in 1828, now it will be much worse. Doesn't it bother you? bother me? Sure not! Anyway, they're too stupid to see me. Hello, Peggy. I'm sorry about the dance. We just stopped by to say hello to your "visitor". where is she? - It's not a "she". - Oh, right? Where is it hidden? Nowhere. He is a man! A man? Where, Andrew? Where is that man? Ah. In the armchair. In that chair? But if there is no one there. Of course I do! You have drunk! No. Yes. The bottle is there. It is he who has been drinking. My poor love! - Who's been drinking, Andrew? - The general! Est� loco. V�monos. No, we have to help him, do you understand? I no longer hold a grudge against him, I want to help him. - I do not need help. - You have the right to drink a drink - occasionally. - I haven't been drinking. Yes, I forgot, it was the general. - Isn't it? - Stop that little game. You can trust me. Tell us about the general. Is he kind? Tell me about the kind general and we will help you. - You won't believe it but... - Yes, we believe you. You wanted it, I don't care if you don't believe me. I'm talking to General Andrew Jackson, Member of the Court and Senator from Tennessee, spirit of New Orleans, Governor of Florida and seventh president of the United States. He's crazy, I tell you. This is where you are sitting? Good. Merame, Andrew. Meme well. �Cuidado! See? There is no general. I was able to sit on the armchair. It is gone. And I would like you too. Has he left the armchair? where is he? Take your time to answer. Where is the kind general? Think. Somewhere. See? You do not understand me. I'm trying Andrew. �Est� aqu�? �Cuidado! �Aqu�? �Aqu�? You're going to hit the general! I'm going to kill him, yes! I just want to help you, because there is no general! Drop that. �D�nde est�? �Ser� m�o! - Where is he? - Peggy, stop! - Peggy, stop it. - �D�nde est�? Ser� m�o. What are you doing, damn it? I'm going to kill the general! �Qu� verg�enza! Go away! Both. You have no right to... under my own roof I have no right? �Por San Mois�s, let's see that! There is no general. I beg you, Mrs. Grondos. - And? - Peggy didn't do any... - He never drinks. - A copy, be it. But let him bawl until the lamps vibrate and never stop, I don't think it's good at all. I was trying... You are very young and so is she. In a while you will know how to contain yourselves. You're a good boy and I love exuberance but from now on, a little restraint. A little measure. Old skin should be shaved off. And the young lady! A vicious. It almost knocked me down. Thought... If she catches me younger, I'll throw her to the ground in less than a whistle. Who is it? Peggy? I'm going to marry her. Finally, I was going to do it. We'll continue tomorrow morning, I'm sleepy. I come from far away, I need a good bed. Of course. Have mine, I'll sleep on the divan. By Jupiter! This could kill a man! - Good morning, Andrew. - Good morning, Jake. - Do you want something? - Another bottle of... Last night's business. Old Maryland. That's it. Another Please. Did you like it. I'd like another bottle, that's all. Agree. - Good morning, Andrew. - Good morning, Mrs. Ballard. How about the dance? It was... I didn't go. Peggy won't be bad, at least. No, it's fine. Believe. Good morning, Mrs. Ballard. - Here it is, Andrew. - Thanks, Jake. Can you wait until payday? Of course. Do you want some bromide? Thanks, I never drink it. Could you bring me a bottle every morning? That would keep me from coming all the way here. Do you want me to bring it to you, as if it were milk? MEMORIES OF ANDREW JACKSON �Presten atenci�n! June 3, 1941, it's a quarter past eight. This is the 867 edition of the morning news. �Eh, peque�o! �Ven, r�pido! What's up? Listen, there's a ghost. According to Senator Smedley, the United States depends on the British fleet It's not a ghost. It's the radio, it's something new. It can be turned on or off. �Qu� horror! I can tell you, how startled I was. I should have warned him. Have you heard that gossip? The American fleet has foundered. �C�mo? We depend on the British. The enemy has sunk our entire fleet. No. Our fleet is fine. And besides, we're not at war. Who then? The English and the Germans. The English and the Ale... You mean the Hessians. The Germans now. Germans, Hessians, Prussians, it's exactly the same. They've already caused us trouble. Don't tell me the Brits and the Hessians are smacking each other! S�, se�or. I never would have believed to see it... If I have to choose, I prefer the English. At least they speak American. Where is the war going? It's on many fronts... - It's a big one! - Many countries? - S�. - �Cu�les? England, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Australia, China, - Japan, Lithuania, Estonia... - By Jove, enough! Damn brawl! You can tell now. By all heavens! It's our chance! �Para? While everyone is cutting their throats, we are going to annex California. We got it. You have to civilize them. Seriously California - is already civilized. - You're crazy! - Where's the whiskey? - In your hand, sir. Get ready. With any luck, we'll have a lynching today. Good, se�or. - Excuse me, Mrs. Grondos. - Sorry. Let's do today what I have in mind. If that fails, I'll put myself under your orders. As stubborn as Ezdra. Okay, but remember: we're wasting time. I really thought I was talking to a general. �Un general! That's it. And he had a bottle. Two. He bought another one this morning. He wants one every day, with the newspaper. I don't want to say anything, out of respect for Peggy, But the city accountant... It is coming. Come on. I'm sure Mr. Lancaster doesn't know anything. He is the mayor. He's talking to himself. Yeah, but he said Lancaster didn't know anything. It seems serious to me. I feel guilty. Two liters and it's still standing! - Watch out! - Do you need the whole sidewalk? I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry? - �Sientes qu�, Andrew? - Nada, Sr. Marberry... The mayor will understand the matter, he knows. I must account for that money. It's my first dishonest balance sheet. over here - What fly would have bitten him? -She is talking to herself. - What did it say? - I haven't heard. Impossible to support a wife on $22.50 a week. �Perd�n, Andrew? I haven't said anything Srta. Kelly. - You old indiscreet witch! - Old witch? So I had no other recourse but to come to you. Well, everything will work out, Andrew. He is rambling. I should stop drinking. I do not drink. Not a drop, ever! Let it go, though. I think a lot about you. D�game... - How much do you earn? - $22.50 per week. They will answer me for that! I have always preached that deserving employees are rewarded. I've only been here four years... I increase the ground. Starting today you will be paid $25. Either my collaborators are happy and well paid, or I resign. - How could I thank you? - It's no big deal. take the afternoon off, You have to celebrate your rise. I don't drink, thanks. I'm going to get the books and finish the balance. There is nothing more to talk about, I will take care of it. �No! What drives you to shout and gesticulate? - Have you lost your mind? - I have a migraine. When I shake my head, it disappears. Go sleep it off somewhere else. And drop those dubious stories or you'll be in serious trouble. You already have your raise. - do you want something else? - Are you trying to corrupt me? I won't get it. I want to present an honest balance. Forget that balance, it's an order. - If not? - He's fired. Very good. You are like them. Rejects an honest balance. But I know someone who would be interested. - Oh, yeah? And who is it? - The prosecutor. P�ngame con Beamish. It's the mayor. Andrew Long comes to see him. I'm busy. I have gone out. Mr. Beamish is not here, I'll give you your message. Shall we have dinner tonight? Hola, Peggy. �D�nde est� Andrew? I don't know, I don't care. - Ah, �sabes? - �Qu�? That Andrew gestures and talks to himself. - I dont believe it. - Me neither, but I've seen it. - Looks like he's been fired. - Didn't you say anything about last night? me? Of course not! --Cundo volver.? --Ni idea. You can wait for him, sit down. No, thanks. Why do you sit? �Perd�n? You answer me: "No, thank you" and sit down. - What is this about? - I wasn't talking to you. Mrs. Grondos, I'm worried. Have you seen Andrew? Not since this morning. Afternoon. He has been dismissed, the mayor has confirmed it to me. Do you know what they say out there? Yes, and I have already given my opinion. He's not crazy, and he's not a thief! Of course not. Remember what they said about Columbus. Aren't you going to receive us? �Qui�n son "nos"? You and me. Enough with you, no. Good afternoon. Go. Ten�a raz�n. Believe in my old experience. Are you ready to listen to me? S�, se�or. Tomorrow morning, you challenge the mayor to a duel. I can't do that! Why? She has slandered you. Duels are prohibited. If I kill him, they will arrest me. Arrest you for a duel? What is left for a slandered man if he cannot fight a duel? - Follow justice. - There is no more to talk about. Listen to my mother's words on her deathbed. He called me in and said, "Andy, never lie, never steal and never start a lawsuit for defamation. Fix that another way." That's what I've always done. Baja. Come with me, Dr. Upjohn. No, Peggy. yes from experience that people do not like to see doctors if they have not been invited. You'll manage better alone. What do I have to tell him? Let's see... First, smell his breath. If you smell alcohol, call me. I have drugs to get you drunk or kill you. What if he hasn't been drinking? You marry on the spot. In the act? Yes. If he hasn't been drinking, he's crazy. If he's crazy, he needs help. If you love him, you will do as I tell you. Definitely. You will Dr. Upjohn. Another thing. If he talks to you about ghosts, act like that's normal. Go with the flow. But marry him! Agree. But it starts with the breath! Which makes a total of $1,240. Happens. Good night, Peggy. B�same, Andrew. With great pleasure. Don't you use anything for your breath? No, �por qu�? It doesn't smell like alcohol. If it was for that, you're wasting your time. I have not drunk. Is the general still drinking? - Is he here? - Yes, in bed. I know, I saw it when I entered. I didn't want to bother you. - Have you seen it? - Of course. He's been lying down since he came in, isn't he? You shouldn't have lied. He has been sitting the whole time. I have to talk to you. I've seen Dr. Upjohn and I know it's all my fault. Why is it your fault? Because we are not married. You've lived in this room since college, alone. You have endured too many stresses and you have collapsed. How stupid. I want to marry you. Tonight. No, as long as this story is not fixed. Let's agree: I object to going after a ghost, take it out. I'm going to destroy this idea once and for all. You prefer that ghost and that is unbearable to me. - You understand that... - I'm tired of understanding. It's the general or me. And if I go, it will be forever. - �Escucha, Peggy! - Dec�dete. �l o yo. It is gone. Really? Yes, really. �Amor m�o! I've had alcoholics, thieves and clingy but never to policemen! And if your snakes dare to touch a hair of that boy, they will have to deal with me. Do not touch me. I'm sorry Andrew. - What do you want? - We have an arrest warrant. - What have I done? - "Embezzlement of funds." - I haven't stolen anything! - You have to come with us. Very good. Not to jail! They obey orders. But they take you to jail! I will need a lawyer. Can you call Mr. Wilkins? Right away. Spare him a brutal interrogation! I'm going to get my coat. Adi�s, cari�o. Do not worry. Can I take this? At the bottom of the pocket we cannot see anything. It's my best cell. The one occupied by Mr. Reynolds after his fall. Furnished and... Everyone must say, "You can't do this to me." Maybe it's a mistake. Of course! Do you think otherwise? Don't be nervous, I was just trying to apologize. Sometimes it's just the thought of being locked up which makes people uncomfortable. But I can not lock if you swear to me not to go for a walk. Would that ease you a bit? Sure, Clem. Agree. See you tomorrow. Good evening. Well, here you are at last! How did you know it would come? You have kept the accounts honestly, have you seen politicians, You have fought for your rights, haven't you? You had to land in jail. Haven't you brought something to drink? S�, se�or. How did you know I'd be here? I didn't know. I took the bottle because nothing else counts. I was thinking of getting drunk. That never, little one. Do not drink more than to be happy, then stop. In fact, I've had some people come over to help you. "Legal advisers". Peggy has talked to Mr. Wilkins. He has defended all the smugglers in the city. With my aces, it won't be necessary. They defended the Boston rebels. General George Washington. Mr. Thomas Jefferson. El doctor Benjam�n Franklin. Chief Justice John Marshall. Gentlemen, my young friend and namesake, Mr. Andrew Long. Pleasure. And those gentlemen? Ah�... Jesse James. It is a pleasure. And Mr. Smith. �Capit�n John Smith? Me llamo Henry Bartholomew Smith. I'm sorry, I don't think I know him. Me neither! I beg your pardon, seeing you with all these celebrities... Confess, you're disappointed that I'm not the captain! Me too, in this case. Let's get to the point, and without grumbling. I'm worth as much as you! I'll grumble if I want to. - Okay, you're right. - Obviously! I am going to tell him: I am volunteer soldier Henry Bartholomew Smith, hence he does not know me. They only talk about generals! �Comprenden? I have received more orders than any maid! "Private Smith, do this, Private Smith, do that!" I have crawled so much that I do not know that I have also fought. Private Smith, c�llese. When I want! You are nobody for a long time. By Caesar's laurels, I'm going to have to calm him down! Good very good. I'm worth as much as the others, but they are bigger... Well, sit down and let's begin. Se�ores, this boy is in prison for being honest. I want it out. Suggestions? This cage is a real colander! You walk out of this box with... Never, in short, the law! Don't you want the boy to go out? - Legally. - Always. Could you tell us who you have to deal with? Art Slocumb, the chief accountant. A rascal, a rascal! Sam Savage, el ec�nomo, Mr. McCall, the treasurer. He is a very good friend of the mayor. When they foresee a new street, they buy the land and resell it at a great profit - once the fairway is done. - Petty, players, picky! Let's rip their ears off. No violence, I beg you. And what have you done about it, young man? Nothing. Why, if he knows that they are robbing his fellow citizens? I take care of accounting. I get paid to do that. I do my job honestly, that's all. His reasoning escapes me. A government that is not honest is everyone's business. Do you know that by silencing the crime, you become an accomplice? Doing your job is not enough it is not of great virtue. Democracy is a responsibility. Do you see what he means? Yes, but I have no desire to play heroes. Neither do we! I wanted to breed horses. Tom was a university student. Well, printer. Tambi�n escrib� and invent� cosas. Andy was a farmer, Marshall was going to have a good legal career. Something pushed us to "play heroes". Who is it? No doubt Clem Watkins, the jailer. �Todo okay, Andrew? You have a visitor. Mr. Wilkins is in Chicago, he'll be back in 10 days. We need another. I've already made another solution, Peggy. Who have you called? To the greatest men of law that America has ever known. Are you okay? Very good, why? Doesn't loneliness weigh you down? Not much less! Do you want a book or something else? No thanks, Peggy. �Bueno, s�! �Qu�? A bottle of Old Maryland. Smith! Get out of there below! - Has the agent left? - Yes. �Qu� verg�enza! If they had persecuted him as much as I did... Be correct! has been dishonored enough already. After what he said to Lee at Monmouth, "Be right"! �Soldado Smith! �Shut up before he busts his damn body! He's kidding. Let's get back to business. The worst enemies of the State are the civil servants who betray the trust that the people grant them. You have a mission, young man. Like all good Americans. And by Jeovah, I envy you, you and them. Let's look at the media. To quote a great friend who wrote almanacs, his name was Richard: "A peasant between two lawyers It's like a fish between two cats." Therefore, I suggest that our friend fend for himself. Admirable! You can take your case to the people and serve our cause. We all know we're not livable more than to the most discerning eyes. So let's take advantage of our invisibility to spy on those rogues. And your discoveries will serve as my defense. Exactly. But what about the tests? You will say that you have them. What's up? Excuse me, your advice amazes me. �Por qu�? He advises me to lie. �Por qu� no? That damn legend of the cherry tree again! If so... It won't be a lie at all. You will have information and saying that you have proof, how would I say it... you will do nothing but tell the truth, a little rigged. I think I understand. So, it's decided. I suggest we rest. Do you understand why the Revolution took 7 years? AN HONEST MAN IS THE MOST NOBLE WORK OF GOD I'm sorry, gentlemen, I do not accept. I'm sick of getting your scammers off the hook. That's not very diplomatic, Judge Krebbs. To hell with diplomacy! I'm sick of these things. Pi�nselo well and you will see that you have no choice. It's fair. I will not win just one more election. It is more than all that, and you know it. I really want to leave Sam to his own devices. - Why did you do that? - I won't buy that. He seems to forget where his money comes from. Sam has done a foolish thing, we must cover it up by hook or by crook. We are going to throw everything on the boy, but we must act quickly. The governor returns on Thursday. Everything will be over. immediate process. Scramble of the moment and all that. If Krebbs puts in a little of his part, everything will be fine. How could I get into your political shenanigans? Okay, but it's the last time. Look at him, alone at the table. He's crazy! Defend himself alone! If those rednecks don't arrive, I'm going to make a mess, legal or not. �Si�ntese! Nothing that is useful. Dr. Franklin, a man's freedom depends on us! Yes, yes. Do we have something? - Nothing. - So, we have to get to work. You had to go directly to the mayor's office instead of snooping where subordinates. The process can begin. Gentlemen of the jury, you, me and this unhappy boy we all grew up here in Shale City. All of us here, except one, love our city and our country. Furthermore, we know that the nation is in danger. The salvation of our Democracy passes by locking up who makes fun of her. This man has been charged and I intend to prove his guilt, for having appropriated part of the municipal funds. Fraud, theft! This little rascal it strikes at the very heart of our administration. What worse for the confidence of the people than an official who robs his fellow citizens, thus mocking the most sacred trust. �M�renlo! Ce�udo, taciturn, with a mental state I doubt by dint of reading instead of practicing those sports that make the whole world jealous of our youth. Objection, your honor! Rejected protest. Eesas everlasting lectures they are the mark of radicals, agitators, spies and thieves. This country will discover its weaknesses too late or will it continue to be a Democracy? We will dishonor our heroes and our traditions or shall we safeguard the temple of Liberty? We will become a nation of cowards Or will we go down in history once again? We will leave these traitors of civic honesty corrupt our democracy? Desecrate our flag and overwhelm it with their contempt? Or will we see to it that this glorious symbol of Justice float forever above the land of free men and from the country of the brave? Thank you, gentlemen of the jury. I know they will do their duty. As a psychiatrist, I have examined the defendant. I have found him grumpy, secretive, suspicious and irritable. He suffers from frequent hallucinations due to alcohol. Protest, boy. We have skin on the bench! - Prot... - �Rechazada! The accused presents very clear signs of asociality, of cyclotomy, of schizophrenia and perhaps of epilepsy. I suggest putting him in a psychiatric hospital until you can reintegrate into society. He is not crazy! Be quiet. As a banker, I warned the authorities. He said: "It's my first dishonest balance sheet." It's worse than New Orleans. The signed and countersigned checkbook is in the safe. Andrew Long era one of four who knew the combination. He showed him the evidence of his guilt. She fell apart. I asked him to go confess to the prosecutor but he broke his promise. I'm a bank teller, in Denver. Four and a half weeks ago, a certain Robert Ambrose came to open an account and deposited three checks for a total of $1,240. The account was closed as soon as they were paid. This is the note written by Andrew Long to remember to watch the arrival of those three checks. Rejected protest. Gentlemen, Andrew Long had an accomplice in Denver. I sent you those fraudulently drawn checks. It's murder. I'm going to pick those late lilies and look for the evidence! The trial is suspended. Can anyone tell me what this thing is for? We are not doing scientific research. Well you should, my dear Marshall. If we delve into its secret it could be useful to us. I've known him forever. He is sound in spirit and sober. I am compromising my reputation. protest. It is an opinion, not a test. It is accepted. The jury will ignore this testimony. Pay your rent without ever failing And he's the best guy I know. And tell that hustler take good care of your hair if you don't let the boy have a taste of it. - Objection, your Honor! - Accepted. Change or you will be in contempt of court. Well. I will be contempt. For the record. What are you doing, gosh? Calm down, general. No battle is won by being calm! The toad is calm but the man is nervous. We're looking for evidence, as agreed. The trial is almost over! They've ripped that boy to shreds! General Jackson, as a military man, Do you have an idea what this is? Something that spins. So. He puts on one of those gossips. the mayor did last time Scramble of the moment and all that. If Krebbs puts in a little - everything will be fine. - How could I get into their political shenanigans? Agree, but it's the last time. I know this voice! - He is the judge of this trial! "For all the heavens, everyone is in this scrub! Your nerves have served us well, Mr. Jackson! John, you have always boasted about your elephant memory: �demu�stralo! I've known him for eight years, and we've been dating for five. He has always studied without anyone's help. I have never seen him drink and he is the most honest man I know. He has never lied or made unfounded accusations. He reads nothing but good books, about the founders and values ​​of this country. And no matter what is said here, I will marry him no matter what. It is exact that during one of his visits, told you to be in the company of General Andrew Jackson? Answer please. S�. That's it. Are there other defense witnesses? No. Do you have any evidence to present? Your Honor, I had not planned to speak but Mr. Beamisch just forced me. Many believe me crazy for not having a lawyer. They are wrong, I have many. I have with me some great men of our history, tales como Washington, Jackson, Franklin, Jefferson and Marshall. And some more. I will do no more than quote instructions given to a jury by Andrew Jackson: "Decide what is fair between two parties, such is the meaning of the law." Today, I ask nothing more of you. The accounts were rigged and my superiors have had me arrested for making this complaint. benjamin franklin said: "Complaints cannot be repaired more than when they are known. When the complaint is a crime, hope turns to despair." According to this principle, I had the right to complain. Thomas Jefferson said: "First of all, we have to keep the avenues of truth open. The most effective in this sense is freedom of the press, because she is the first victim of those who fear that their actions will be investigated." This should answer the comments about my readings. El Sr. Beamish He has spoken a lot about Democracy, accusing me of subversion. In fact, Democracy seems to be in fashion. I do not understand this: For me, it's not about the Sunday suit that one wears to parades. It is a way of life, that of a good man, an ideal by which one lives and one dies. I hope I don't seem too jingoistic because love of country must be sacred and discreet and not serve any personal motive. But Mr. Beamish has led the way and I do nothing but defend myself. Mr. Beamish has given you his conception of Democracy, I think it's my duty to give them mine. Democracy is the right to express oneself. For anyone. It is the right to vote without fear. For anyone. It is the right to believe and practice your religion be it Christian, Jewish or Voodoo. It is the right to work if one wishes and study. It is the right to raise their children without fear of the future. It is the duty to support the elderly without being ashamed of them or their family. It is: "Do unto others what you would have them do for you." It is also the prayer of the Pilgrim Fathers in the desert, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, the Emancipation Proclamation and the dreams of an emigrant mother for her children. These are my values. If I'm wrong, take me to jail. If I'm right, let me prove my innocence. Me... I think that's all. Since the defendant does not have a lawyer and being that he does not present any evidence in his defense, I have to inform you that as accused of alienation This Court will grant you all its benevolence. Impossible, Your Honor, I am perfectly sane. In that case, you should know that your destination it depends entirely on the evidence presented here against you. I know. Your Honor, I think I have my proof. �S�! Here's your gun, little one. Write down. Watch him write. I have never seen anything so ridiculous. Do you have everything? What will I be writing? Go ahead and aim straight for the heart. Your Honor. El Sr. Ollie Lancaster, el Sr. Art Slocumb, el Sr. Sam Sauvage, el Sr. R.R. McCall, Mr. Beamischy and a sixth person they were all this morning gathered at the town hall. I have a transcript... �Protesto! Protest temporarily rejected. Ac�rquese. Mr. Beamish, I know your rights, but stay put. It is a rare case. - A "sixth person"? - Yes. And do you know who it is? S�, se�or. Didn't he intend to reveal his identity? No, sir. Unless the court forced me. The defendant may continue. This testimony is totally out of place. Rejected protest. You can testify. The meeting started like this. From now on, I quote verbatim. Mr. Lancaster said to the sixth person: "That goes further still, and you know it." This test is nothing but gossip! I oppose this attempt to sully the aforementioned with no other proof than a piece of paper. How does the prosecutor know that these tests are going to sully the aforementioned? That's how I calculate it. What other reason would there be? That is what I would like to know. Your protest is rejected. As you said before, this is a court of law. The Court orders you to stop harassing the defendant. Your Honor, the prosecution seems disturbed by this testimony. If you wish, I will provide my proofs in advance. Young man, you're speaking under oath and no one can doubt his testimony unless you prove it to be false. Continue, please. As I was saying, the mayor said to the sixth person: "That goes further still, and you know it." and this person respondi�: "How could I have gotten into your political shenanigans?" From now on, I will read. Sixth person: "Okay, but it will be the last time." Lancaster: "Le cre�a m�s malvado." Beamish... �Por favor! I have just been given some information that seems important to me. The prosecution requests a recess of 30 minutes. Does the defense agree? The defense agrees. The session will continue at 4:30 p.m. JUSTICE FOR ALL The session opens again. Be quiet and listen. The Court has several unusual statements to make. The prosecutor has requested to eliminate the burdens weighing against Andrew Long. The mayor of Shale City has promoted Mr. Long chief accountant of the municipal treasury, if the latter accepts, of course. Prosecutor Beamish and Mayor Lancaster, after having interviewed the accused, they have resigned from their public positions. McCall Treasurer, agent Sam Savage and chief accountant Art Slocoumb they have also submitted their resignation and will be incarcerated during the grand jury investigation. In view of all these facts, this Court can only pronounce a dismissal. The court presents the defendant, Mr. Andrew Long, your sincerest excuses. The trial is over. Young man, I hope to finish my career with your marriage. - Finish? - Yes, I will resign. He has given me a chance to be honored again. I wonder what it feels like... It's 2:30 in the morning! What's up? Nothing. There is something, this is not natural. I'm not sleepy that's it. �Yo, s�! And you can stay up all night if you like that much. I appreciate what you've done but even when you love people, sometimes you have the need to be alone. You want me to go. Don't worry, son. Call your older brother Andrew. On hand, se�or. I want to thank you for everything you've done. If I have disturbed you, please excuse me. Pamplinas. I am a man from the past. You belong to the future. - Don't betray him. - I'll try, sir. Thanks for the jokes. And thanks for the whiskey. You're still talking to yourself still! I said goodbye to the general. Cuidar� de ti. Andrew, I can see it! Really? Yes. He goes to the lake, by the shore. It has turned around. He greets us. He goes in socks. It's going to catch cold! No, wear my sneakers. Starred well. Starred well. Subt�tulos: adelon
