"It is the slogans necessary for our nation... that I reiterate before you. I hope you will raise the slogan after me." Long live the soldiers! Long live the farmers! So sacred and pure is this land... on which culture first made its mark. And whose light spread far and wide. This is a story of this very land... of this very nation ...of India. Malang uncle! Malang uncle! Wake up! It's daytime already! Another day, eh? Look at that, Bharat! Dhaniram, the hypocrite, is praying to the rising Sun. No one cares for the Sun that is setting. Why not? - You'll know that... when you grow up. What if I don't? I'll shave off my beard and call you my elder instead! But I want you to wake me up all the time. What if I don't? - I'll continue sleeping. Should I still not awaken you? I'll never awaken, in that case. Take this lamp, for example. It is lit, when I light it. Similarly, I wake up, when you awaken me. You're philosophizing again, aren't you? You'll find people lecturing you over food... but there's no lecture over lecture itself! Which is why I speak my mind! Okay? Go on now... you're getting late for school. My God! You're a butcher... not a barber! My hands waver when I'm dealing with a customer... who's using my services on credit. Well, all right. Get on with you work. I gave your sons a haircut, Mr. Sundarlal. I haven't been paid for it. - How much is the money? It's only 3 annas! - Only 3 annas?! D'you realize the worth... of this blood that you've made me lose? It took 2 big boxes of clarified butter... to create so much of blood. How much would that cost? You're going to be the loser... if you insist on talking business. Get on with your work! Hold it! Wait... Hello, dear! Mind your business, Sunder! But, of course! You roast the grains... and I sell them! You've got going so early in the day, haven't you? Welcome, O Father of the Village! I thought I'd have some buttermilk in your house. Buttermilk?! - Why? Is something wrong? We've never had yogurt in the house, since my wife died. How'd we have buttermilk, then? Never mind... I can have it in the marketplace instead. Give me the money, then. You've nicked me again! Here you are... Take it, Labbu. It's for the shave you've given him. I'll have the buttermilk with Ramu in the fields. Say, Ramu! Why are you quiet? What're you thinking of? It's you I'm thinking of. - Me?! Why don't you get married again, Krishna? Marry again? - Of course! For your daughter's sake. You may not need a wife. But your little girl will need a mother. You're right, Ramu. But what happens my daughter doesn't have a mother... even after I marry again? Don't talk about yourself. There's hardly anyone in the world... who's been happy after a second marriage! Not every woman is like your wife, Radha... who'd shower more affection on her stepson, Bharat... than she gives her own son, Puran. I was told, too, that the Stepmother... would make life miserable for Bharat. But the affection Radha has for Bharat... has silenced everyone! Radha! You've been hearing your praise in silence, eh? Let's eat, Bhishen! Go ahead. I'll free the animals. Greetings, Lalaji! Greetings, yourself. How are you, Radha? Please have lunch with us, Lalaji. It's you people who are my diet, my friend... I mean, it's your yield. Get on with the harvest as soon as possible... so I give you some money, and keep a penny for myself. Right, Lakhpati? - Right ho! It's only when my boss gets his penny... will he give a coin to this manager! Why worry, Lalaji? I could let you have two pennies! A lakhpati (millionaire) by name and a pauper at heart! I'll buy you a cot instead! But you'd rather be working at a place... where they're honest. Understand? You shouldn't be hopping around at everyplace. You have just one leg. Take care you keep it! There are lectures on rations... but no rations on lectures! Which is why I always speak my mind! Besides, I straighten out guys with my kicks! Let's go, Ramu. I'll eat with you instead. Dhaniram lives only on money. How was that? Didn't I let him have it? Believe me, sister... I'm not lying. I'll now mend my ways and will never be a bad man again. I swear by you. This is the last time I've been to prison. Forgive me this once. I assure you... you will be ashamed to call me your brother again. You've been saying that all the while. I swear by God this time! You've always sworn. But why are you assuring me this time? Whom can I call my own, but you, Radha? You're the only one I have... my flesh and blood. Come to the point. What do you want? I swear! I want nothing! All I wanted to know... is when is the festival of "Raakhi"? Can I come to have the sacred thread tied on my wrist? Raakhi is still six months away. Sit down while I go and get some buttermilk for you. You're a gem of a person, Radha. Keep my jewelry back there! Or else... Get out! Shameless man! Don't step in this house ever again! We have nothing to do with you anymore! Thank God, Bharat saw you stealing the ornaments... and hurried to tell me. Or else... Get out, I say Get out! Mother! Well, you brat! Couldn't you shut up for some more time?! Why should I? - Why should you?! You bastard! I'll beat you black and blue today! Why did you squeal to your Mom? Why did you steal? You call me a thief?! Father! - Call your old man! I'll deal with both of you! Mother! You scoundrel! You dare raise your hands on my son?! Father! My son! Step aside! Father! Father! Father! Don't worry, Radha. Your fields will always be ploughed, so long as I live. I will plough them for you. I can't help you plough the fields, Kishan. But I can fetch food for you in the fields... serve you well, and even guard the yields. Man can achieve everything... but you're never through with what you're saying. I speak the truth, Kishan. These kids will repay you, once they are grown up. Go ahead, kids... It's time for your school. Take Puran along, Bharat. Bharat! Bharat! Where are you? What is it, Som and Mangal? There's a letter from your brother in the city! What does it say? My brother has passed his tests this month. Well, guys... do you know what it means to "pass"? No. Why don't you move further from Class 6? You don't want us to spoil our father's reputation, do you? How is that? - Listen. Suppose we study more than our father has... won't we subjecting him to a lot of ridicule? But he'd be happy if you studied hard and succeed! You are educated. But you still slog in the fields. We've got to handle our father's business, right? Till our aunt is at the oven... our old man won't allow us in the shop! The Major? Greetings, Major. - How are you, Bharat? I'm fine. How are you? I thought I'd meet you before I left for the city. Bharat! Lunch has arrived! Do come over! I'm coming over! Let's have lunch together, Major. Sure. Let's go. - Call the other men, too. Come over, soldiers. Let's have some food. It was a coincidence that I met you here, 5 months ago. And we've had food together, whenever I've met you. But although I've invited you to dinner so often... you just don't find the time from your farms! I'll surely come over, once Puran returns from the city. It's only 15 minutes away. The farmers must see how the soldiers... are making out on the borders. I see them, whenever I'm passing by. God willing, I'll surely come over some day. Greetings, Major! - Greetings! How are you? God is kind, I must say! What will you have first? The bread or the buttermilk? I'll have them both together. Let me wash my hands. There's a letter from Puran, Mom. He's said to have done very well in his exams. He has asked me to send him 200 Rupees. I'll fetch some money from the post office, while you eat. Please give it to Puran. Wait, Bharat. I'll give Puran the money from my pocket. You can repay me when I return. Don't you have faith in me... that I'd really give the money to Puran? Faith? Faith binds human beings together, Major. Why me alone? The nation pins its hopes on you, Major. All I was saying was that... - Look at that, Bharat. The plough and the gun. You have faith in our guns. And we have faith in the farmers. Together, they're the faith of the whole nation. What's up, Puran? You look glum. Hasn't your brother sent the money to you? No! The money arrives even before I need it! The Major has given me the money today itself. Let's go, then! - Where to? From one place to another. No, thank you. I'd rather not waste any time. With the exams ahead, we must concentrate on our studies. Studies, my foot! You're a bookworm! But your dreams aren't going to be fulfilled by studies. Studies alone can't buy you cars and bungalows. You must see the world outside the hostel. And change your name, too. I'm sorry, but Puran is terribly out-dated. You must call yourself Puran Kumar... and have all the fun with the new name. This is my friend, Mr. Kumar. And she is Kavita, who has completed her studies... in medicine only recently. But she wants to stay in the rural areas... and gain experience in medicine. Haven't your brother and his wife come today? They're sitting there. This is Mr. Kumar. And this my uncle, Robin. This is my brother ...and that's his wife. Please come and sit down. Welcome. By day, you say we are all tied to one another as humans. And by nightfall... you say these relationships are all fake... that they mean nothing. Why do you say that? I say only which I must. But by nightfall, I speak the truth. I advise you, too... do favors to everyone as you must. But think of yourself first. Do you understand? What does that mean? Mean? I mean, you must be careful of the ways of... the world and the people who inhabit it. Well, never mind. It's very late. Go home. You've got to leave for fields early tomorrow. Here you are... This is the money I owed you. Can I have a sweetmeat? - Sweet? Here you are... Say, darling... - What is it? You've roasted so many grains from my shop in your oven. Heed my heart, too, darling! Shame on you! So when do we have the wedding? There's no one to stop either of us! If not your own old age, think of mine! She's right! You?! What cursed hour was it when you were born to me?! It was the time when our mother passed away, dad! Talk to your father, boys. Or else... Or else?! What? Will you stop roasting my grains in your oven? No! You'll stop getting your supplies. The old man has no vices. But grains will undoubtedly be stopped! Shut up! You dare talk to your father in that manner?! Get lost! Go on, both of you! You, too! When you get married, do adopt these boys. I'm fed up of them. Had it not been for them... how'd you have changed the topic? Stop teasing the old lady. - But... Do you understand? - Sure! I do! The doctor! She has just arrived... and she's already pestering us to keep things covered! Greetings, doctor! - Greetings. Just a moment, please! Do listen to me! Don't you know him? No. Then you'd better know him. Or you can't get by in the village. This is Malang. The free-bird. Bless you, dear. And this is Bharat. They're the conscience-keepers of the village. Bharat has been to High School. He's the most educated farmer in the district. May I leave now? Excuse me... you're a guest in our village. Should you need something, do let us know. You've lost weight. Don't you eat well in the city? You say that each time I return from the city. I'm fine, of course. What are you doing here? - I belong to this village. But what are you doing here? Didn't I say I've got to gain experience in medicine... in the villages? You're here for experience in medicine, then, are you? That's my brother, Bharat. I've already met him. How do you manage here? There's no club, nor a restaurant? Don't you get bored with the monotony? Not at all. The clubs and restaurants have their own place... and life in the villages has its own charm. It's very peaceful here. And the folks around here are good, too. I must leave now. - Sure. See you soon. It's only good people who call others good, too. These folks are as good as they are rich, Bharat. For all his riches, her brother still does a job. He's a top Central Investigation officer. Why did the doctor call you Kumar and not Puran? Puran is considered to be an old and outdated name. Kumar is the most happening one. So I thought I'd call myself Kumar, too. Father! Are they doing a favor to me? Look where you're going! You're gonna be fixed, too! Know what? I came here for some medicine for my younger one and the... lady-doctor says I mustn't have anymore kids! What else do I do? - She said the same to me. Really? - Me, too. Good God! She has said that to all the women in town! But why is she misleading us? It's for your own welfare. - Our welfare?! Had you my welfare at heart... you'd have asked me to bear a dozen kids! A dozen kids?! - Of course! My grandma had 12 sons and 4 daughters. She was even given a reward by the Government, for that. But times have changed. No one in the village has 12 sons anymore. How many children you have? - I?! A son and a daughter, a son and a daughter... I have 8 and was trying to meet the challenge... and you've started lecturing me! What does your husband do? He's a clerk for Dhaniram. How much does he earn? - 140 Rupees. But he's a millionaire by name. How do you manage? - Easily! We eat well and make merry! I mean, how will you manage once your children grow up? What do you mean? - I mean... what about their marriages? And their education? We have a free-school for kids in the village. I could've gone, too. But I felt shy. If you only had 2 children, instead of 8... you could possibly have sent one of them to college. Come here. - What is it? See how happy they are, with just two children. Yes! They're all smiling! Those who have many children... are in trouble themselves, and so are the children. They're all crying! It's a bloody battlefield! God! Isn't that what happens in my house, too? You're right. And listen... They've all fled! But never mind. I understand a bit of what you're saying, doctor. The day I learn more, I'll drag them all to you. But I must leave now. Good-bye. They're scared of you. But I'll drag them over. Greetings, lady. - How are you, Bharat? Greetings! - Puran?! What funny clothes have you got from the city? Don't you have a loincloth and a "kurta"? We were listening to you speak. You have a nice way of making them see reason. You have commendable ideals. The villagers praise the doctor, and... The doctor praises the villagers! That's good! Let's praise each other. There's no better way to compromise with one's life. But we must leave now. Let's go, Puran. Puran? So your name is Puran, is it? Actually, I'm known as Puran in the village. That's a better name. - See that, Puran? Only good people can appreciate good things. Bharat! - Greetings, Lala! Greetings, yourself. Talk to them! They've gone crazy! What's wrong? They refuse to sell their harvest this year! Nobody sells a harvest. We sell the grains we grow. And I sell grains, too. Businessmen like you buy our hard-earned grains cheap... and hoard them in your stores. That leads to a scarcity of foodgrains in the city. You take advantage of the situation... and sell the grains at four times the cost. You use our sweat to fleece the others, Lala! I pay you, don't I? You don't starve! Then why must you worry about others? Talk to them! They insist that they'll do just what you say! They're right, too. This season, we will sell our yield... directly in the marketplace. It's okay even if our payments are delayed. People will have to spend less to buy the grains. You may leave! We will not sell our yield to you! I see! So you're going to hoard your yield... like the other farmers, eh? Hoard the yield? What do you mean? Ask Banwari! Ask the others! Haven't they been stocking the yield every year! Ask them! Is it true, Banwari? And you, Shyamu? What's gotten into you? Look at the bust of this great man, and you will know! The dreams of such great men are never fulfilled... thanks to farmers like you and businessmen like Dhaniram! You have no right to do this on a land... where these men have laid down their lives. It's a national asset! It's the people's property which must reach them! Forgive me, Bharat! I swear! I'll never do such a thing again! Such a thing will never be repeated again! Have you heard them, Lala? You may leave now! What happens when word spreads to the neighboring village? Lt'll gradually spread all over. And no one will sell their yield to us anymore. You must always think of the worst! If I don't make money, how will I pay you? Then what are we to do? - Do? Bharat will simply not see reason. And nor will the others, so long as he's around. In that case... Lakhpati! Go and beg of Shyamu! Plead with Banwari! Or I'm going to lose face! How am I going to face the merchants in the city?! Go and make them agree... or your kids are going to starve! I have no children, Lakhpati! You will inherit all I have! Go on! Hurry up! How are you, Lakhpati? I'm in a hurry. I'll talk to you later. Greetings, Lala. - Greetings. Sit down. What brings you here? I've returned to the village after ages. I thought I'd look you up. Is everything okay? I need your blessings to get things in order, Lala. And I'll fix anyone... you want me to. What does that mean? I didn't like the manner in which Bharat spoke to you. Times have changed, you know. What can I do anyway? You can do a lot. I've spent 12 years in the prison, Lala. And I've sworn to myself throughout the 12 years... that I'd avenge myself, once I was released from prison. From whom? - From Bharat. How will you? - With this! Good God! Put it away! It scares me! Scared, eh? No one will ever know! I'll have avenged myself... and you'll have accomplished what you want, too. No one will instigate the villagers anymore. This is my challenge! - God bless my soul! Give me the instructions. - Instructions for what? I'm a miserable man; and you're wise man who... can understand the plight of others. You can always tell me, if you need some money. Money flows like water, Lala. Before the streams of money dry up... here's what you want! What've you been thinking of? I was only admiring your photograph. It's beautiful. Really? There's the rat turned tiger, isn't it? How is that? You couldn't even the muster courage to speak in the city. Now that you've returned to your village... you've learnt to weave a yarn, too. I have always felt like talking, Kavita. But it was out of shyness that I couldn't speak up. Have you become shameless now? What's wrong in lavishing praise, where it is due? Your brother was right. - What did he say? "Let's praise each other" "What better compromise with life could one find?" Never mind that. My brother and his wife are coming from the city tomorrow. But I must leave now. See you tomorrow. Bharat... - Yes? Without tractors or tube-wells... doesn't farming require a lot of hard work from you? Every profession requires hard work. Besides, if a farmer does not work... where will the grains come from? My brother is happy with the hard work he puts in. But that ought to be a matter of pride for you, too, Puran. You're right. But just look at him. He's always slogging away, like a pair of animals! He's here before dawn. And leaves the fields after the sun has set. Meaning? - I mean... even after giving farming the best years of his life... what has he stood to gain? The sweat that stains his soul? You have never listened to me, Bharat. Let's have our say. And let's have her opinion. About what? Bharat is an educated man and has never been a shirker. Why shouldn't the two of us start a trade in the city... that helps us improve our lifestyle? You can't neglect your culture out of selfishness, Puran. But I... - Puran! Why do you want to settle in the city? To make money and earn a livelihood, isn't it? People in the city may either be employers or employees. But they're all striving to sate their hunger! And you can sate your hunger only with bread... with the grains you grow in these fields. Our migration to the city won't cause a famine! If every farmer thought in the manner you do... do you know what would happen? You'd breed hunger here, instead of human beings. Our nation faces an acute shortage of foodgrains. We have to import our sustenance. While it is indeed a favor of those who support us... it's a matter of shame for us... that we lack foodgrains in a land of farmers! Who is responsible for this state of affairs? It's the farmers who love the city, more than they revere their lands. It's those who hoard the foodgrains. It's those who think of growing more... but never give a thought to the growing population! Concentrate on the fields, Puran! You know what the two of us can do together? Double our income?! - Not the income... we can have double the yield! When we work together shoulder to shoulder... there will be a day... when no one in this country will ever starve! See? Hasn't he started lecturing me over it?! And what are you thinking of, doctor? It's true, Puran. This land is like the palm... on which the farmer ploughs his ware... and changes the destiny for man. Meaning? - I mean... you can wear trousers and still be a farmer! Hear that? Lunch is served, Bharat! - Come along. Do come. It hurts! It's over... Be patient. I've done it. You're Mangal. And you're Som. I hope you will remember your names now, won't you? Let's go... Hey, uncle! - How about the money? What for? - For the tattoo, Uncle! If I'm your uncle, what would they mean to you? Cousins, of course. Would you ask your cousins for money? Forget your dough! Right, Som? - Absolutely, dad! Just come along... Give him the money, dad. He's gone yellow in the face. It's not for money that he's gone yellow! It's the season of harvesting that's done it to him! He has a yellow face; I wear a yellow turban. All is yellow! Yellow, all! I'm sick of these illnesses, doctor. If one has a sore-throat, another has a stomachache! It's I who has the Stomachache, dad! Okay. I know... Let me see your tongue. I can maintain all the accounts for my employer... but I can't keep track of how many children I have! I wish you had come here eight years ago... I wouldn't have had a caricature every year! Am I a caricature, dad? - No, son. I am! Too many children are burdens on the nation and the parents. What'll I do, when I already have a battalion of them? But never mind. I can warn my neighbors! Uncle? I was worried when I saw the blood you had lost. Thankfully, you're not seriously hurt. How did this happen? I slipped when I was going towards the fields. I fell on something hard which hurt me... and I came over to bother you, so late in the night. I must leave now. I'll return this piece of cloth tomorrow. Very well. - Thank you. Excuse me... Should you not sleep out of pain tonight, have a pill. Bahadur... can you check if there's someone outside? What if there is someone? - What? I'll request who it is... to tell anyone, but not my mother about this. Why? She'll be worried sick, if she gets to know of this. I have a very nice mother. You are very nice, too. Only good people can call others good, too. Isn't that why you call everyone a good person? When will you come again? I'll have to now. You're the doctor and I'm the patient, after all. There's no one around, sir. Both of you are terribly shy. But I'll help the two of you. My sister-in-law told me that you have called me here. And she told me that you had called me over. Why did she say that? Why did she lie? She did that for me. Now look, madam. You are a doctor... and I'm a mere farmer. In a world where man snatches other's livelihood... to sate his own hunger... a farmer feeds so many others, so he can earn his own living. He feeds millions. You're right. But you have moved to the village, from the cities. But perhaps I don't deserve to spend my life in the city. I do hail from a family of progressive thinkers. But our faith in the holy epics is as strong as your own. In the environment of the cities... we may have undoubtedly come to dress differently. But we have not changed our culture. Had Puran been here now... he'd have accused you of lecturing him like me! You have evaded my question. Who can evade a doctor? You haven't answered my question either. Do you know what I'm carrying? What is it? The sleeping pill. I didn't have it last night. But I'm sure going to need it tonight. Let's forget the past, son. Your father was hurt quite accidentally. And, as you know... I've spent 12 years in prison to pay penance for that. But if you still haven't gotten over your anger... here's a knife. Give vent to your feelings! By God, Puran... he has only your welfare at heart! That's the only reason why I've called you here. Right! You want to live in the city. Don't you, Puran? And you're terribly fond of cars, right? You can certainly have a car for yourself. How? Bharat is just not willing to sell the land. God forbid! You don't have to do that at all! I have business spread all over the big cities. The old man that I am, I can't handle everything on my own. Don't I need a man to handle my business then? Since you are educated, you can take over the affairs... in the city, and I'll handle business in the village. According to Lala... you will easily get a salary of 1500 or 2000 Rupees. Really? - Absolutely! Just arrange for the money and get on with your work. Arrange for money? What for? I'll explain! You will handle thousands of Rupees for me in the city. As security, therefore, you will have to... deposit 20000 Rupees with me. 20,000 Rupees?! It's child-play for you, son. Bharat is a rich man. Whatever little Bharat could collect he spent it all on my education. Good Lord! Look up the accounts, Lakhpati, and tell me... how much Bharat deposited with me and just how much... he took away including the interest. In a moment, sir! He deposited the money with you last year... and took it away only last week. The principal was 20,000 and the interest is 3,000. 23,000 Rupees?! Does Bharat have so much of money?! He's been saving it for years, son! Bharat works hard and even saves his money! Bharat will give me the money, if he really has it... He will! Certainly! The fish has taken the bait! It was dangerous to try and kill Bharat, wasn't it? Yes. But there are things I still can't figure out. You'd better understand that which you haven't. Puran will now ask Bharat for the money. How will Bharat give it to him, when he has none? Puran will then demand the accounts from Bharat. And then? - Bharat has a battle royal! But how do we stand to benefit from their war? The foreign powers have always taken advantage... of the fights we have with one another in the country. And this chap is a mere mortal! When must you leave for Delhi? - Tomorrow morning. How many days will you stay there? A week, perhaps. That's quite a long time, isn't it? A very close friend of mine is getting married. That will obviously take time then. Yes. But I can't say whether I'll like it there. While you think of leaving the city... I'll think of your return here. That'll take care of the time. Kamli's father came here this morning... offering her hand in marriage to Puran. Even when Puran and Kamli were kids... your father had fixed their alliance. Let's just get him married then. How can I do that? The elders marry first and the younger ones, later. Not I, Mom! - Stop blabbering away! As soon as I find a girl... I'll get you married first and Puran's turn comes next. If you have a girl in mind, just tell me. I won't waste time looking for a bride for you. Am I such a nincompoop... that no one comes to you with a match? There are so many! But I don't seem to approve of any of them. If one of the girls is tall, the other is short. Some are fat, yet others are skinny! What's wrong with you, Mom? I never used to think of these things earlier. But ever since I've seen the lady-doctor... it has set my mind thinking. That's the kind of bride I would want for you. Wouldn't you like that, too? Puran! Come on inside... Mom has been talking about your marriage. I want to see the books of account. The books of account? - That's right. I want to know how much of money we have made... how much we have spent and just how much we've saved. What are you talking about? I've only asked Bharat for the accounts, Mom. I want to know how much of money he has saved. Saved, my foot! He slogs through the days and nights. He has spent whatever he had saved on your studies. What made you ask for the accounts? Because I'm a partner, too. - A partner? Have I no right over the property? Have I no right to ask you anything? Everything belongs to you! What do you want? Speak up! 25,000 Rupees. - So much of money?! It's a question of my life. I could lay down my life for you! But what do you need so much of money for? Even if I burn the money... I still want it! So much of money, Puran? Bharat has a lot of money, Mom. This is easy for him. I swear I have... - Don't take false oaths! What has gotten into you? All I want is the money. How do I convince you... - You can't convince me! But I can provide the proof. - What proof? Proof of the fact that you're a rich man! If what I say is a lie... just come with me! Where to? - To Dhaniram! Well, okay. Let's go! Why must I lie to you, Bharat? You had deposited 20,000 Rupees with me last year. And I paid you 23,000 with interest last week! It's a lie! A white lie! I've got face God, son! And I've got to show my books to the Government. You're an educated man! Take a look at it! You, your books and everything about you is a falsehood! Praise the Lord! You can have your little fights in your home. Why waste the Lala's time? Who are you to interfere? I'm your brother. And the Lala's employee. If you wanted to hide this transaction from Puran... you should have told me! Neither would I have told Puran... nor would there be a fight between yourselves. You are lying again! You have turned against me... only because you can't get grains from this village... for your black-market! And you're my enemy because... although you attacked me with a knife, I am still alive! Knife? What nonsense?! You attacked me last night. I didn't say a word about this... because I didn't want to bother Puran and my mother. This is a lie! I was away in another village, running an errand for Lala! Ask him! - He's right! I will ask no one! You will never succeed in your designs, Lala. I've a raised a voice in this village today. Very soon, it will be the call of every farmer! Foodgrains will go to the needy! Not to the dubious stores you have built! I want an account of our holdings... not of the stores the Lala has built. Believe me, Radha! No matter how much of affection you shower on him... he considers you both to be his step-relatives! Or why would he want to swallow his share... Shut up! I know you hold a grudge against him! My God! Why must I hold a grudge against anyone? I'm an uncle to him, just as I'm an uncle to Puran! Uncle, you are. But the Evil Uncle. Don't let them mislead you. They've poisoned your ears for their selfish gains! Whatever they have told me is the truth! I'm glad I've awakened to the truth about you! Do you see what the Stepson has done?! Stepson? You are the stepson! Not he! Let him go, Mom! Stop it! Try to understand, Puran... - Don't you touch me! Hear me out, both of you! I you don't give me my share, I'll drag you both to the courts! Don't give me the money, if you don't want to. Let there be a division of our land! You've gone mad! You want us to divide the land? The land... that is like our Mother? How can anyone divide a mother?! I beg of you, Puran... There's no need to beg before him! He wants his share, doesn't he? He will have it! Let there be a division! That is my decision. - Just settle my account. I don't want to live in this village anymore! You can't! The villagers will slipper you if you wish to live here! The barefooted ones will spit on you! You've learnt your lesson. Haven't you, Bharat? I asked you to do others a favor, as you wished to... but only after you had looked after yourself! The naive man that you are, you could never realize... that although the virtuous ones were born in every era... his supportive brother was never born again! As for you, Puran... You should have asked for a share of Bharat's virtues! A share of his humanity! If there is anything you should have asked for... it should have been his compassionate heart... that could have you blessed, too! Let's go, son... This is disgusting. Let's go away... from this place of sin... where dwell the evil men. God Almighty! This piece of land will now belong to Bharat... and that one belongs to Puran. Mom! Go on, Mom. Stop it for a while. These are legal matters, son. Step aside for a minute, Lala. Go away, all of you. Listen to me, Puran. Hear me out, Puran! I've heard everything! That's enough for me. You can speak instead, if you don't want to listen! Say it then! Say that I've betrayed you! That I have cheated you! That I have turned out to be a cheap double-crosser! But I am not as bad as you think I am... or people have misled you into believing. Had I ever hankered after money... I'd have taken your advise and moved to the city. There was no need for me to slog in the fields! If I had to eventually betray you... I wouldn't have raised you either. I sent you away to the city, for your welfare. I know what I've been through... having sent you so far away. Had a letter from you to be delayed for two days... I spend anxious time at the post-office. Why did I do all that? Only to betray you? No... it's not true. Everything is still the same. Just come and apologize to Mom... Let's put an end to her agony. I cannot change my decision! Besides, I've only asked for my share! Why must that bother you? It does hurt a man... when one's limbs are severed. It is a blow to one's soul! But, then... I'm a man of honor. I have always opposed a division; and still do. Here you are... Take this. This the Title Deed of the entire property. I have already willed it away. I have willed my share of the property... in your children's name. That too, because I don't you to sell the fields... and heap humiliation on our motherland! Our mother has shed tears on his piece of land! It has the sweat and blood of our forefathers! This land belongs to our future generations. It is our bounden duty to preserve it. It is our duty to plough the land. Promise me, that you will never neglect the fields. I implore you, in the name of this soil! I have been transferred. I thought I'd meet you, before I left for the city. I got to know everything, when I visited the village. It's thanks to the rains that I've got meet you today. You didn't tell anyone that you were leaving... not even your mother. Why? I couldn't muster the courage, Major. My mother's tears would have shackled me. I think things will improve if I stay away for some time. But how did you get here? I arrived in the Sikh's truck. The truck belongs to God, my friend. I was only at the wheels. Where will you go now? - Anywhere. And what will you do? - Anything. Do you have something to get on with anything? I have two able hands. These are my goodwill and my investment, Major. What are you thinking of, Major? I was wondering if a farmer... could be a soldier. Is that possible? Really? - Of course! Let's go. How much for the tea? - I have already paid him. This way... This is our store, son. Follow me... We have ten stores as big as this one. We stock wheat in 8 and rice in the other two. Follow me... It's for you to handle the show now. I'll introduce you to my other partners this evening. Work hard and honestly... and just make sure you keep everything a secret. So you have joined the army, have you? Yes. Farmers and soldiers... both yield to the land. When are you visiting the village? I will, during my leave, after the training. During the leave? When are you going to the village? Tomorrow. Would you do me a favor? - What is it? I just got this address from your clinic when I left the village. I met no one else. Not even my mother. Please look after her, if that's possible for you. I won't be able to do that. It's my duty to serve your mother. I can very well do that. Anything else? Tea is served, Kavita! Come over quickly. Come along... let me show you my new house. I couldn't wait for you to visit the village. So I came over myself. When did you come to the city? I came this morning. But I've arrived just now. How's Mom? And Mr. Malang? They're all fine. And they miss you a lot, too. I'm getting a leave of 2 months in a couple of days. I'll sprint to the village, the moment it comes through. Should you be against sprinting... you can drive with me in 10 days time. Between the family in which you've been brought up... and the one you intend to marry into... there's a lot of difference. Differences, there are... but no obstacles. Please don't misunderstand me. I admit, Bharat possesses all the good qualities. Feelings of humanity, ideals, and principles... but you need much more to live comfortably in society. Is he capable of that? I'd have been happier if you had asked... if I'm worthy of a man who has ideals and principles. You're right. We can get the richest of men, should we want to. Besides, we forge such ties, only once in life. Such ties are never forged; they happen on their own. As happened, in my case. I went home, but Mom wasn't there. Would you know where she is? She has gone to the city. You seem to be angry. Your father spoke of our marriage... He did speak of it... And it was meant for Puran; not someone called Kumar. How's the car? It's good... very good. Cast a glance at your fields, Puran... and see how they are. Why are you quiet, Madam? We have even invited some guests... and what could you be thinking of? I've been thinking of the vast difference between you and us. You have given me such respect and joy... that I can't bring myself about to express anything! We must have been related in our previous birth, too... that we have got to have a daughter-in-law like Kavita... Neither will we find a boy like Bharat anywhere in India. What was that? I didn't follow you... For purpose of "Dhanyamaan"... "Dhanyamaan"? What is that? It was a similar word... Now, what was it? Kanyadaan (giving the girl away in marriage). Yes! It was giving the girl away in marriage! Whom, but Bharat, could we give away our girl to? I understand! You've told Bharat about this evening, I hope? The battalion has assembled here, sir! I have orders for you. The enemy has attacked our nation! Our integrity is being challenged by the offender! We will give them a fitting reply! Anyone who sets foot on our sacred land... shall be wiped out! We have just 8 hours. Be prepared. We leave at anytime for "Operation Area" Who's that? Daman? - Yes, this is Daman here. This is Bharat here. I'll be there by six, this evening. But I'll have to return soon. Why is that? My leave has been cancelled. What for? We are into war. We are on a notice of just eight hours. The C.O. Has given me 4 hours... after getting to know of everything. Will you be going to war, too? Yes, I will. But please don't mention this to Kavita or my mother. I'll explain it personally. Something wrong, Bharat? Nothing. - What are you thinking of? Just that my mother has a happy day after ages today. But naturally. A mother goes crazy with joy... when her son is engaged to be married. Yes, but I mean... Are you worried? About the war? Not at all. I consider myself fortunate... that I have been called upon to perform my duty. What I am worried about is how I will reveal... all this to my mother, on a day like this one? What will I tell Kavita? What kind of a test are we being subjected to? Look, dear... my son will be here in a little while. Let not our eyes reveal the turmoil we're going through. Let's leave him happy. Let's allow him to be happy. How are you, Kavita How are you? Who wouldn't be happy on such a day? Congratulations... I got to know over the phone. - What is that? That Mom has consented to our match. Mom had once told me in the village... that she'd find me a wife just like you. And there she is! She's bringing me Kavita herself! She must be thrilled... isn't it? But there is something I can't figure out. What is that? You fell in love with a farmer... you're getting engaged to a soldier... but whom will you eventually marry? Marry? Must I tell you? I'll marry a man... who will bring the fields to life, when he ploughs them. Who will emerge victorious when he turns a soldier... and prompt the nation into saying... "Glory to the soldier; glory to the farmer" Bharat! My son! Mother! Mother! How are you? Now that I have seen you, I am happy. I am delighted. Mr. Bharat will sing a song for us! When I was engaged, I sang a song, too. Now that you're getting engaged, you must sing! Why are you quiet, Mom? There's nothing to be worried about. Don't be scared. History is witness... that every mother of this country has blessed her son... to go and protect the motherland. I was not destined to toil in the fields... but this is how I will perhaps serve the motherland. When you meet Puran... do forgive him. I met everyone today... except him. Give him my regards, when you meet him. I wonder if we will ever meet again... No! Don't ever say that! You have the blessings of millions of this country... nothing can ever harm you! Nothing can! Go on, my son. There's little time. And you have to meet a challenge. Mother... - Yes, my son. Go on... O Lord! Protect him! In the name of the Lord... victory shall be ours! Let's retreat! The Indian forces are advancing in great numbers! Glory to India! We do believe in peace. We will try to maintain peace, if possible. But there is no room for cowardice and spinelessness! We will answer their guns with our own bullets! Congratulations! Now is when we get the right price for our grains! A war has been declared. If prices have doubled today... they will increase four-fold soon. We stand to make 16 Rupees for every Rupee we invest! What do you think? It's a good idea, but dangerous, too. Danger? Danger from whom? From the Government. The police have been carrying out raids recently. The police will never be able to reach our stores. How many places will they raid? The villages? Our stores in Delhi... Bombay and Calcutta? How many places can they reach anyway? Greetings, Mr. Lakhpati! - Greetings, sir. Please sit down. What brings you here. I came here with Mr. Dhaniram... and I thought I'd look you up, too. That's kind of you. But where are you put up? We're staying with Puran. He's become a big man! Had Bharat listened to his brother's advise... he'd have been a happy man today. What business is Puran into? He trades in foodgrains with the Lala. It was always a very lucrative business. But since war broke out, it's become even better. Puran said they'd make 100 for what is worth 1 Rupee! How is that? They've locked up all the stores with foodgrains. Inflation will set in when there is a famine... and foodgrains will sell for many times their cost! And they have many stores in so many cities! Where does Puran live? - On Nehru Road. What's the name of the building? It's called Seva Sadan (House of Service). Wonderful! A right place for the right man! I must take your leave now, Mr. Lakhpati. I've got to attend to something urgent. Good-bye. Good-bye. I haven't made a mistake by telling him, have I? Not at all. You've done the right thing. I won't spare you! Take that! Why are you beating him up? Why?! I gave him food yesterday! And he's back to asking for more! Food?! Why aren't you eating? I'm on a diet. It doesn't look like it. In the shadows of a night so intoxicating... what a nightmarish night do these youngsters spend! So dark it is! Issues as this one relating to the nation... are often dismissed lightly by these vicious characters. These men who drink... drink not liquor... but the blood of innumerable human beings! And now that children starve for a morsel... such men trample precious food under their feet! Several such roses are crushed in their hands! People have not even clothing to cover themselves. And these gentlemen are not fond of dressing! These men of the intoxicating nights... also responsible for the dark nights for many... are drunk on wine and women... I want this stock increased four-fold. Mix thrice the quantity of tiny stones. Buy all the stocks of rice available in the market. Buy it at any price it is available. Sir! The police are here! Police?! Run away! Escape! For God's sake! Why did you have to go and tell him everything?! I didn't know that Mr. Daman is a policeman. I was only bragging! I didn't know we're into something illegal! Lakhpathi has deliberately done this! Why should I do that? Couldn't I tell Puran that the two of you... instigated a fight between brothers by lying to him? You have been paid by my boss! But what have I received? If you begin to suspect me, I'll spill the beans to Puran! He's joking, Puran! But even if we have lied, it was for your own welfare! Why did you lie to me? Why did you? It was for your own welfare, I say! And now that you've grown rich, you act smart with me? Whatever he has done has been for your own good, son! Besides, think of what you are... and what you were! What have I come to be? Where have I landed? Lt'd be best for us to flee to the village! If the police land here, we'd be in real trouble! Lakhpati! You are accompanying us! Our enemy is silent since this morning. The enemy has captured the Major. The enemy laid siege to the jeep we were travelling in. They overpowered the Major. I followed them quietly... they're now hiding behind the hills. The Major was carrying some important documents. We must save him. Get ready, Bharat! This is where they are holding the Major captive. The enemy troops number not less 25 to 30 men. Set off a fire on the other side. Where did the gunfire come from? From yonder! What's up? The Indian Major refuses to speak... and we can't decode this message and this map. Go and bring the Major here again. Who are you? - Bharat What do you want? - The Major... hurry up! Bharat! - Let's go, sir! The map and the documents are very important, Bharat! Go ahead, sir. I'll fetch them! You'll find a soldier waiting outside. ...Map? Let's go, sir. Hurry up, Bharat! Not there, sir. This way, please. What kind of men are you? Why don't you give me some water to drink?! You will get the water when it arrives. Why have I been kept in darkness? Why is there no light? Till the lamp arrives, you will stay in darkness. Take him away to the HQ! If you try to escape again, you will be killed! Soldiers are not afraid of death! You are given time till dawn tomorrow. If you still don't answer our questions... you can imagine the consequences! No! When I woke up from my slumber today, I realized... that life itself has treated me like a poisonous snake! The devil whose world revolved around... riches, cars and bungalows... today stands defeated, dead and vanquished! I have come to you. To hand myself over to you. Ask the Government... to parade traitors like me in public... and heap shame on me! So no Puran ever tries to be a Kumar again! So no brother suspects his God-like brother ever again! The Indian Service Society: Hospital Brother?! You? I came to take him away. Praise the Lord, Lala! I'm doomed, lady! Talk to your brother, will you? ...Well?! My brother is a wise man. Whatever he does is right. Listen to me, Kavita. Tell Puran's mother that his life has changed. How? - He has turned an approver. He is the one who revealed the names of the Lala... and other blackmarketers. It is with his help that we have unearthed... foodgrains in millions of tons from various stores. All that in just one night. - And where is Puran. He's in the city, but will be here in a day or two. Have you any news of Bharat? No. Look there! Our pilots have waylaid two Indian aircraft's! And what is that? The Indian pilots have made away with their aircraft's! Malang uncle! What state are you in?! I was captured by the enemy. I've had great difficulty in reaching this place. You have lost a lot of blood! Which village is this? Village? It used to be... it does not exist anymore. The few houses that existed here... were bombed without respite... The village and its citizens lie in ruin and disaster! How did you get here? I had accompanied a music party and somehow got here. We distributed the food we got from the residents... among the needy and the soldiers, too. How far is our village from here? 4 miles. We were about to return... when the enemy planes blew up the bridge across the river. Som and Mangal were with me, too. They've gone to find another route. What happened, son? What's wrong? Water... - I'll get it! I'll fetch it in a minute! Here you are, Bharat! Have some water! Blood! For all the people who died in the well... it has turned the water, red, too! Where are the devils who wage a war? Where are the wolves who thirst for human-blood?! If I were to meet them, I'd say... if you still aren't satisfied with the lives lost... come and sate your thirst with this blood! Man has now gone beyond the Moon... but humanity has sunk to the levels of the bloody-water! Water... I'll go and bring some water for you, son! Shame be on you, you swine! People cremate or bury the dead! But you are robbing them even after they are dead! She was a newly-wed bride who was killed... and her husband must be lying dead somewhere, too. It won't make any difference even if you take away... her matrimonial necklace. - You're crazy, Malang. You can't get such opportunities everyday. Fill your pockets! You'll find many expensive things lying around! Sure. Many expensive things indeed! But there is something more expensive, too. Let's take him to the village. Who is it? - Bharat. He's badly wounded. Let's carry him to the village. Do a good deed... and it'll wash away all your sins! Where is he? - Lying by the well. Let's go to him. - Go on... I'll go and find some water for him! Recognize me? Uncle? The evil uncle! The legendary evil man could not slay his nephew... but I will not spare you! Look at this! See this? Do you?! No! Get up! Face me! Face me, my foot! Go away! Get lost, you scoundrel! Get the hell out of here! Let me see who saves you now! Malang uncle! - Malang uncle! Open your eyes, my son! Talk to me! Why doesn't he speak? What's wrong with him?! He's all right, isn't he? We have only one bottle of blood in our stocks. And this blood does not match his blood group. What do we do now? I'm here! Drain me of every drop of blood! But please bring my son back to his senses! There's no time to lose, my dear! Look at his face! It's drained of all the color! Follow me. We can't use her blood. It doesn't match his blood group. How can you say that?! How can't a mother's blood match her son's?! I'm his mother... It's on my milk that... No... No! He has not grown up on my milk! I have not been fortunate enough! He was not born of my womb! But haven't I raised him with my tears and sweat? Is it necessary for a woman to bear the child... to really consider him as her son?! Are her affection and love worth nothing? I beg of you, Kavita! Save my son! Save Bharat! Please save my son! Don't lose hope! Everything will be all right. He who has the blessings of a mother like you... is bound to be protected by God. But where will we bring the blood from? From me! From my body! Take my blood, doctor... but save my brother! We may be step-brothers... but we share the same blood! Take every drop of blood from my body... but save my brother! Please save him! We can use Puran's blood. Mother... Take him to the operation theatre. The case is even more complicated now. I don't think we must lose any more time. I don't know what to do. I can understand that. This is a moment of your test. You will have to control yourself and perform the operation. What?! Yes, doctor. The latest reports reveal that the poison... has spread to other parts of his body. His wounds have turned gangrene. If his arms are not amputated immediately, he might... No! No! Let the poison spread... if it will. It will only result in death; I will merely lose my life. Talk to him, mother! What kind of human-beings are you? You want to severe the arms of a soldier... so he can never carry a gun again? You want to severe the arms of a farmer... so he can never plough his fields again? No! Puran! My brother... Tell them that my arms will never be amputated! Why are you being stubborn? Haven't I told you? My arms will never be amputated! Never! Don't be stubborn, my son! I place you under an oath, my son! You are beholden to me, my son! My hands... Without my hands... I will never be able to touch this sacred soil again. Never will I touch this sacred soil again! Mother... Mother... He's out of danger. The operation was successful. You may leave now and return tomorrow morning. Didn't I tell you that you'd be all right? Where is Puran, mother? I'll call him. Bring your hands closer to me... Who can ever say that I have lost my arms? Here they are... My arms have today been restored to me! Look at this Mother! I have found my arms again!
