AAMU FILM COMPANY PRESENTS It will be horrible. I love this land. And these people. They're good people who wouldn't hurt anyone. What'll happen to them now? Whatever happens, these are facts, and it's impossible to derive an argument from facts that tells how things ought to be. I don't have any more time for this kind of nonsense. Sign the contract. THE WOODCUTTER STORY FIRST CHAPTER If you allow me, I'll recite a poem I wrote for this occasion. When I think of love, I try to capture it with words. Blood runs through my veins, rushes to my heart and the heart explodes. The heart runs down my chin and onto my boots and into the longing of snowy forest roads. But when I think of friendship, words come to me clear as electricity, lying in a casket, quietly like snow. Life is a long evening. Finally even the arrive home. Happy birthday, dear friend. Thank you. They collected money for you. Oh my goodness. Why? Out of malice, I guess. Drinks are on me. Tomorrow is Saturday. We are gathering to discuss questions regarding existence. What kind of questions are they? Who are we? Where are we coming from? Where are we going? I like the idea. But we have other plans. Kaisa has invited Maija and me over to dinner. Today's Friday. Crybaby. In conjunction with these big changes, the company is ending the production and sale of lumber. Unfortunately we'll have to terminate your employment contracts. What a great plan. Taking our jobs. - We're just middlemen here. - Mining is the future. The era of sawmills is over. Let it go. That's what happened, guys. An invisible hand came, grabbed our throats and strangled us. I'm sure they have their reasons. What do you mean, really? Why are you talking to him like that? I'm sure he can answer. You know that if you ask Pepe, the glass is always half full. I'll spit into a glass like that. Don't mind them. I understand why they're upset. It's terrible news. Yes, it is. For all of us. Don't worry. I'll find a new job tomorrow. Sawing is all you know. And ice fishing. You can always learn new things. I suppose we'll manage some time with the income from the store. People still want to read books. I suppose so. I'll go for a walk. I'm drunk. - Did you catch anything? - We're just on our way there. Come have a beer. I'm depressed and need cheering up. This is the end of our cheerful village. Everything will work out. We mustn't despair. I appreciate your words, Pepe. I appreciate them very much. But I don't think so. My little namesake, we're being tossed around by the forces of fate. The life we're living feels meaningful to us, but I'm afraid it's an illusion. It's terrifying to think that nothing matters. That's okay. We'll make fish soup with potatoes only. Hello. Unemployment is driving me crazy. Then there's another thing. It's really bad. I want you to drive me. Maija is cheating on me. Are you sure? Yes, I am. I've seen her go see the barber. Above the barbershop. The mood is like in the Port of Rotterdam. How can she do this to me? I'm sure Maija doesn't mean it. What do you mean? Surely she didn't go there by accident. I'm trying to love her, but I can't anymore. My self-esteem is destroyed, and as I'm wounded, I can't love anymore. There's nothing else to say. Not even you can say anything. Right? Maija thinks sex with the barber is better than what we had. Apparently he's very well endowed if you know what I mean. Oh dear. I talked to the doctor about my problems, and he prescribed sleeping pills for my anxiety. But now I have dreams of the barber and his big dick. How about you and Maija come to our place tonight? We'll play cards, and it'll be like before. I never happen. Maija won't come. I'm sure she's at the barber's right now. Why don't you come then. - You can come alone. - Alone? To play solitaire? My soul is gone, and I'm thinking about my death, but it's an interesting proposal. - I'm sure things aren't that bad. - Yes, they are. Let's just go. They called from the hospital. Your mother had a seizure. Mom, are you okay? I'm dying, son. I'm not okay. - Maybe it was just a seizure? - No, it wasn't. And I don't want to spend my last moments debating about the terrible sludge that was sucked out of me through a tube. What would you like to talk about? Shit belly. I'd like to tell you about the important things I have in my heart. But of course. Don't interrupt me when I'm talking, dammit. I'm dying. Or did you forget that already? I'm sorry. It's difficult to analyze feelings. But now when I look at you, I think I feel love. I feel nice and warm, like in front of a fireplace on a cold winter's morning. Or maybe another batch of the sludge is coming out. Mom was old and sickly. She was only 64. I feel so bad for you. That goddamn barber. It looks like he's seeing other women as well. - Isn't that good for you? - No. Soon I'll be the scum of all the cuckolds. Didn't Mom come home? No. She said she's going to the barber. That's what my mom always says. I know how you feel. If there's anything I can do... We can't do anything. And it's not your fault. I feel so bad for him. He just lost his mother and all. He's such a good man. If anyone is, he is. We've just grown apart. - And I've changed. - Listen. You have the right to your feelings. And you don't have to make any decisions now. You have the funeral coming up, and I need to sort out the mess I'm in. Have you talked to Maija? Yes, I have. It came as a bit of a surprise, but I made it clear and said it's over now. I said that I think she should go back to Tuomas. I agree with you. Let's give it time. Right now I feel like everything is a big mess. - But things will work out. - I hope so. That's right. Easy now. Easy. No. You should've seen what they were doing here. I was just protecting you. Call the ambulance. He's dead. He got what he deserved for messing around with our wives. What else could I do? - I'll go now. - What do you mean? I'll drive into a truck head-on on the highway. Don't. There's always an option. No. This life is over. Now that the men have ruined everything, we'll start a new life in the city. Go to hell! This dang cold weather. Two houses have burned down this week. You have home insurance, right? It was too expensive. Hope is alive. SECOND CHAPTER This world is such an exciting and beautiful place. We don't understand it fully yet. Shall we go get new haircuts? Finally customers. How come you're working here alone? Where are your parents? I'm an orphan and this is my salon. If you continue talking to me like that, I'll burn your ears with a hot iron. What do you want? A haircut for my son and a shave for me. Shall we start with junior? Sure you know how to talk? I don't like mute boys. What is love? Your grandma said it's a warm feeling. Like sitting in front of the fireplace on a cold winter's day. A young person only needs a regular paycheck and the freedom to do what the heart desires. I'll give you free advice. Devour life while you still can. It might be over faster than you think. I only believe in myself. As I am my own master. May I go out? Of course. What are you doing here snooping around? Get lost. Where's Little Tuomas? A PSYCHIC SINGER WILL PERFORM THROUGH HIM, YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEAD Shall we go home? Sure, let's go. Good job, guys. Why are we moving these sacks back and forth? Don't ask stupid questions. Are you saying we shouldn't ask any questions? You can go back to work. You seem to have plenty of it. It's not our job to question things. I don't care as long as I get paid. Exploiters, stop! Close the mine! Exploiters, stop! What the heck is this? Close the mine! Exploiters, stop! Close the mine! Exploiters... This is the end of the road for us. What do you mean? All day long we do our meaningless jobs, and in the evening, we numb our brains with alcohol and childish pastimes. Amen. You wretched scoundrel. How can you sit there and act as if nothing matters? We're just playing cards. There has to be deeper meaning in life. Or was this all? That's why the miracle of life happened to all of us? Look at yourselves. We'll come with you. What you'll hear tonight doesn't come from this room but from a room right next door. It's a passage, a dark portal, that only a few can enter. Tonight we'll contact the afterlife to discuss the following questions: Who are we? Where are we coming from? Where are we going? Now you have a chance to contact your loved ones with Jaakko's help. Go ahead. One at a time. Who's first? You. Who shall we contact today? Who's waiting for us? - I don't really... - Who died? - My mother. - What happened? I'm not sure, but a tube was inserted in her and a huge bucket of, well, feces came out. Thank you. That's enough detail. Talk to me, son. Crybaby. I can't believe it's really you, Mom. Of course it's me. What do you want to know? Ask me now that I'm here. Well, why don't I ask, are you okay? Don't ask me stupid questions. I'm dead. Of course I'm not okay. Have you seen Tuomas? The fatty who doesn't know how to drive? No, I haven't. He's not here. Do you know where Little Tuomas went? Tell me what you see. I see moving fires in the darkness. A boy who's walking towards them. Tell me what else you see. I see knives floating above the mine. How hot they are. How icy the northern darkness is. Oh, the eternal night. The eternal wind of the north. Let the hot knives drop and burn the land! Replant the forest and save us. I've found meaning in my life. Sit down, please. My assistant. She's not feeling well today. I hope it's nothing serious. Let's stop the unnecessary games. I know who you are and why you're here. Your son has joined us and doesn't want to come home anymore. Is it true? It's all settled, right? There's also another option. Let's get rid of this unnatural barrier between us. Join us. No thank you. If I understood correctly, you've faced adversities recently. You lost practically everything. Why doesn't a man who's lost everything take a consoling hand when it's offered to him? Your loneliness terrifies me. What kind of man are you really? A woodcutter. But I'm working with something else now. Be quiet. Why did you come here? The pain of love was so unbearable. Shut up. Maybe we should discuss other matters. I have a message I want to deliver. To whom? To humankind. Ten years ago I was in a similar situation as you. I felt I had lost everything. I was thinking about different ways to end my life. Some days I imagined jumping under a train. Others, I swallowed a bottle of pills or shot myself in the head. I'll describe my most beautiful fantasy. It's a beautiful spring day. There's still plenty of snow, but the temperature is rising. The sun is shining over the icy sea, and it'll crack any minute. It's as if late, dying winter was ejaculating. I walk along a pier, admiring huge cargo ships. Oh, how massive and powerful they are. I feel the sturdy concrete dock beneath my feet. It's an utterly wonderful day. Suddenly, without anyone noticing, I drop down between the blocks of ice. Between the ship and the dock. The ship sways slowly in the spring sun, but the kinetic energy it generates is enormous. The swaying of the boat and the blocks of ice grind me into little pieces without anyone noticing. I still think about it sometimes. I can tell you don't understand much of this. But that's okay. It's good to talk to you. It's like walking in the woods and talking to wild animals. Or talking to trees. What do you want? I'd just like to take my son home. You have to understand why he came here. What was he looking for? Have you thought about that at all? Of course you haven't because you only think about yourself. Why were we abandoned? Where's holiness now when we need it? Have you ever longed for something that might not exist? Have you ever longed for something, even though you don't know what it is? Like a little fairy tale you believed in as a child, it has lost its charm Or like beautiful scenery that no one's ever seen Have you longed for your life that passes by you without a thought Days, short and long, you never even caught I immensely long for a place I never even knew I've longed for you such a long time I'm sure you can't be true I feel a longing I feel an immense longing I feel a longing I feel an immense longing Have you ever felt a fiery moment and said, "Let's start anew"? Did you then notice that the moment was through? You immensely long for a place you never even knew You've longed for me such a long time I'm sure you can't be true You feel a longing You feel an immense longing You feel a longing You feel an immense longing You abandoned your father and joined us. Your faith is strong. I'll make you my successor. No, I just wanted to be near her. You came here because of her? So my successor is just a smitten little boy. No. I'm immensely afraid this is all we have. The rest is just an endless, beautiful dream. Go to hell! The show is over. But what'll happen to the revolution? That doesn't interest me one bit. Traitor. My mentor is dead. Take us to the mine. This is horrible. What's horrible? This pain people have. I think I know what you mean. Many believe in a spiritual reality, even though it doesn't exist. Some feel it more than others. But that's all. It's horrible and meaningless. There you are. How was work? You're just in time for cutting onion. Don't mind him, even though he always mocks you. I think it's a good thing that one has courage to express his feelings. Pepe, your turn. Is everything all right? Go ahead, spit it out. Let him speak.
