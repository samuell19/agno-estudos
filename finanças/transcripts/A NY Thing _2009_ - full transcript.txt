To do what, it's a movie, don't you wanna watch it? Well, it seems like everybody wants me to watch it. I was born in Harlem. I don't wanna get into like my childhood, but I had a very good childhood. I started drinking and doing coke and I was introduced to crack cocaine and I just couldn't stop. It's a real vicious, vicious cycle that I went through. I was, I wasn't a nice person to be around. I was robbing and stealing and I was sticking people up with guns. I caught a bit in '91 for strong arm robbery.

My foster mother passed away last year and it was kind of like I just had a nervous breakdown. I just lost it, seeing my mother in the casket and everything. They had a open casket. I got caught with five bundles of crack cocaine. They locked me up through just this August. I got out of prison August 8th, and since I've been out August 8th of this year, I've been clean every since. I'm 44 years old and I don't wanna be out here on the streets 50, 60 years old, God let me live that long. I think I'm gone be all right. You know I just gotta pray. Thank you for sharing the moment.
