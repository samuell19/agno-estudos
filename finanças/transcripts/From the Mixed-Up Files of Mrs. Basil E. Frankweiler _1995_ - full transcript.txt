Woman narrating: MY NAME IS MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWEILER AND I HAVE A STORY TO TELL. IT BEGINS WITH AN INVITATION I RECEIVED TO ATTEND A PRIVATE AUCTION. A FEW ELITE ART COLLECTORS, NOT TO MENTION A MUSEUM OR TWO, WERE GATHERED TOGETHER TO EXCHANGE ONE ANOTHER'S TREASURES. I WENT THERE THAT DAY NOT TO BUY BUT TO SELL SOMETHING VERY DEAR TO ME, SOMETHING WITH A SECRET, A SECRET I HAVE KEPT FOR MANY YEARS. NUMBER NINE IN YOUR CATALOGUE, AN UNDOCUMENTED SCULPTURE, POSSIBLY QUARRIED FROM THE SAME MARBLE USED BY MICHELANGELO, IF IN FACT NOT SCULPTED BY THE MASTER HIMSELF. THE COLLECTOR WISHES TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AND I HAVE ON THE BOOKS A BID OF $25,000. WHO WILL OPEN THE BIDDING AT $30,000? THANK YOU. $30,000. DO I HEAR $35,000? $35,000. THANK YOU, INDEED. DO I HEAR 45? $45,000 IN THE BACK. THANK YOU. 45. NOW $55,000. THANK YOU. NOW 65. DOWN FRONT HERE, 65. DO I HEAR $75,000? $75,000. NOTHING FURTHER. AND-- SOLD TO NUMBER 115. THANK YOU, SIR. Mrs. Frankweiler: SO NOW THE FUN WOULD BEGIN. BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS DID I IMAGINE THE SALE OF MY MYSTERIOUS SCULPTURE WOULD BRING ME THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE TWO CHILDREN. DOESN'T IT EVER DAWN ON YOU TO SAY, "THANK YOU, CLAUDIA. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU MAKE MY LUNCH"? TO SAY, "THE LITTLE NOTE YOU WROTE ME WITH MY CARROTS WAS THOUGHTFUL AND NICE"? THAT NOTE WAS EMBARRASSING. AND I HATE CARROTS! WELL THEN, LITTLE BROTHER, YOUR EYES ARE GONNA ROT AND FALL OUT OF YOUR HEAD. BETTER THAN BEING A RABBIT. MOVE, STEVE. I NEED TO SET THE TABLE. HEY, DO YOU MIND? I'M STUDYING. STUDY IN YOUR ROOM. OR CAN'T YOU FIND YOUR DESK IN THE MESS? MOM, GIVE CLAUDIA SOMETHING ELSE TO DO. - MOM! - WHY DON'T YOU MOVE YOUR BOOKS INTO THE FAMILY ROOM? I CAN'T. THERE'S LAUNDRY EVERYWHERE. CLAUDIA, PUT THE LAUNDRY AWAY FIRST AND THEN YOU CAN SET THE TABLE. WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING-- DON'T START, CLAUDIA. YOUR FATHER'S ON HIS WAY HOME FROM WORK, I'VE GOT TAX DOCUMENTS TO FINISH FOR A CLIENT. NOW YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK; THE OTHERS HAVEN'T. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING A GENIUS. WHEN BOTH PARENTS WORK, SOMEONE HAS TO HELP. IT'S A ROUGH LIFE. Boy: PLEASE, DAD. JAMIE, WE'RE NOT GIVING YOU SKYDIVING LESSONS FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY AND THAT'S FINAL. - I FOUND THE INSTRUCTIONS. - GOOD. - BUT, DAD-- - JAMIE, JUST FORGET IT. I STILL DON'T SEE WHY THEY CAN'T BE A BIRTHDAY PRESENT. WHY DON'T YOU LET HIM BUY THEM HIMSELF? HE HAS MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE FAMILY. NO ONE IN THIS FAMILY IS SKYDIVING. AND CLAUDIA'S BIRTHDAY COMES BEFORE ANYONE ELSE'S. CLAUDIA? I WANT A FOUR-POSTER BED WITH AN AWNING AND A MATCHING DUST RUFFLE. Steven: COME ON, CLAUD. YOU DON'T JUST WANT THE BED. YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE 17th CENTURY. YEAH, THAT WAY SHE'LL BE A PRINCESS. ( all laugh ) Mother: HEY. BOYS. Claudia: HERE'S THE PROBLEM: I DO EVERYTHING RIGHT. NOBODY APPRECIATES ME. MY FATHER HARDLY KNOWS I'M ALIVE. MY BROTHERS THINK I'M JUST A BRAIN AND MY MOTHER THINKS I CAN DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE. THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I JUST WISH I KNEW WHAT. HMM. Boy: CATCH YOU LATER! Boy #2: GREAT GAME TODAY! Driver: STEP RIGHT UP! WE'RE WAITING. SEE YOU HAD SOME PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY. MOVE, BRUCE. I NEED TO TALK TO JAMIE. TODAY, BRUCE. I'M GLAD SHE'S NOT MY SISTER. Both: THOU SHALT NOT SHUFFLE. ( both spit ) Driver: LET'S GET YOUR SEATS. ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. TIME TO CAST OFF. JAMES LINCOLN KINCAID, I'M DELIGHTED TO TELL YOU YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN TO ACCOMPANY ME ON THE GREATEST ADVENTURE OF OUR MUTUAL LIVES. GREAT. WHO BY? WHO BY? YEAH. WHO CHOSE ME? "BY WHOM," JAMIE. "BY WHOM WAS I CHOSEN?" WAIT A MINUTE. YOU STOPPED ME PLAYING CARDS WITH BRUCE TO PLAY A WORD GAME? I CHOSE YOU, JAMIE. I CHOSE YOU BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE GOING TO RUN AWAY. HUH? THE TRUTH IS, OUR PARENTS NO LONGER SEE ME AS A PERSON, RATHER AS AN INITIAL ON THE CHORE CALENDAR. YEAH-- "C." THEY DON'T CARE THAT I GET STRAIGHT As AND AS THE ONLY GIRL, I'M ACTUALLY SUBJECTED TO THE MOST INJUSTICE. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM "ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER"? MMM... NO. JAMIE, WE LEAVE TOMORROW BECAUSE IT'S MUSIC LESSON DAY AND THE BEST PLACE TO PACK OUR CLOTHES IS IN OUR INSTRUMENT CASES. YOU HAVEN'T SAID WHY YOU WANT TO TAKE ME. Steve: HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO? HUH? LATER. HI, STEVE. WHAT ARE YOU INSECTS PLOTTING? OH, NOTHING. - THAT STINKS, CLAUD. THAT REALLY STINKS. - JAMIE! I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN MONEY WAS THE REASON YOU WANTED ME TO COME. TAKE STEVE. STEVE IS LAZY AND UNIMAGINATIVE. TAKE STEVE. HE CAN BRING ALL HIS FRIENDS SINCE YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ALL OF THEM. I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH ANYONE AND I DIDN'T PICK YOU BECAUSE YOU SAVE YOUR ALLOWANCE - OR BECAUSE STEVE'S A DORK. - THEN WHY DID YOU PICK ME? NO ONE ELSE AROUND HERE THINKS I CAN DO ANYTHING. I PICKED YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE A QUALITY I DON'T AND IT'S CRUCIAL FOR AN ADVENTURE LIKE THIS ONE. OH, YEAH? WHAT? A SENSE OF DIRECTION. HUH? THINK ABOUT IT. YOU ALWAYS FIND MOM'S CAR WHEN SHE LOSES IT AT THE MALL. AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THE FAMILY WHO OWNS A COMPASS. YEAH. I GUESS SO. COME ON, JAMIE, CAN'T YOU JUST SEE US HIDING OUT, SENDING MYSTERIOUS LETTERS HOME? WE CAN USE CUTOUT WORDS FROM MAGAZINES AND MAKE UP CODES. AMD WE COULD SLEEP OUTSIDE. AND LEAVE PHONY TRAILS. - OKAY. - WHAT? WELL, I SAID OKAY, AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT TAKING ME FOR MY MONEY, LET'S DO IT. WAY TO GO, JAMIE. ALL RIGHT. Mother: CLAUDIA! DON'T FORGET THE LAUNDRY. SURE, MOM. JUST FOR THE RECORD, JAMIE, HOW RICH ARE YOU? ONE-- FORGET TONIGHT'S HOMEWORK. TWO-- FIND A GOOD HIDING PLACE FOR YOUR TRUMPET. THREE-- PACK CLEAN UNDERWEAR, SOCKS, AND A TOOTHBRUSH. OKAY. WHEN I'M DONE WITH EVERYTHING ON THE LIST, SHOULD I EAT IT? Mother: COME ON! DINNER'S READY! THERE'S YOUR ANSWER. OH, THE KIDS ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS. WHOA! TAKEOUT! Steve: HEY, WHAT'S THE OCCASION? YOUR FATHER THOUGHT YOU DESERVED A BREAK. AND FOR DESSERT, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE INDIVIDUAL BANANA SPLITS. - Steve: WE ARE? - WITH MARSHMALLOW TOPPING? WE ARE... WITH THE TOPPING OF YOUR CHOICE! Mother: OKAY, EVERYBODY, DIG IN! DOESN'T THIS LOOK TERRIFIC, HUH? Father: WELL, I BET IT TASTES EVEN BETTER. EH, JAMIE? Mother: BANANA SPLITS WERE MY FAVORITE WHEN I WAS A KID. Jamie: WERE THEY AS GOOD AS THESE? Father: NOTHING COULD BE AS GOOD AS THESE. HEY, CLAUDIA, ARE YOU GOING TO EAT THAT? - I'LL EAT IT IF SHE DOESN'T WANT IT. - NO WAY. THIS IS MINE! CLAUDIA, IS SOMETHING WRONG? I DON'T USUALLY LIKE MIXING FRUIT AND DAIRY. Mother: SINCE WHEN? SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT CARROTS, THOUGH. HEY, JAMESTER, YOU WANT AN EXTRA CHERRY OR TWO? OH, YOU BET! Mother: THAT'S ENOUGH. WE DON'T WANT A REPLAY OF THE PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE, REMEMBER? Steven: MOM, WE'RE EATING. DON'T FORGET TO LOAD THE DISHWASHER, CLAUDIA. I KNEW IT. I JUST KNEW YOU'D CHANGE YOUR MIND. CLAUD, IF WE LEFT NOW, WE'D BE TRAITORS OR SOMETHING. TRAITORS ARE PEOPLE WHO SACRIFICE THEIR COUNTRY AND COUNTRYMEN FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR OWN SELFISH GAIN. WE ARE NOT TRAITORS, JAMIE. WE WERE GOING TO RUN AWAY! HOW COME YOU WANT TO LEAVE IF THEY'RE BEING SO NICE? I MEAN, BANANA SPLITS AND TV-- WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? I TOLD YOU, JAMIE-- I WANT TO BE APPRECIATED. I APPRECIATE YOU, CLAUD. I JUST DON'T WANT TO RUN AWAY. ( sighs ) HEY, JAMIE, COME HERE! RIGHT ON THE OLD MAN. ( sighs ) Steve: HOW COME IT HAS TO BE AUNT WEASEL? - YEAH. - IT'S HAZEL, NOT WEASEL. SO THAT'S WHY WE HAD BANANA SPLITS LAST NIGHT-- 'CAUSE YOU'RE DUMPING US AT AUNT HAZEL'S FOR THE THREE-DAY WEEKEND. JAMIE, WE'RE NOT DUMPING YOU ANYWHERE. YOUR FATHER AND I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND A FEW DAYS JUST WITH EACH OTHER. WHY? AUNT WEAS-- HAZEL WAS GENEROUS ENOUGH TO INVITE YOU ALL TO HER HOME. I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YEAH, WELL, I WAS SURPRISED TO GET BANANA SPLITS. WE NEVER HAD THEM BEFORE. WE NEVER HAD TO STAY AT AUNT HAZEL'S, EITHER. OH, FOR HEAVEN SAKE. YOU'RE NOT BEING SENT TO PRISON. WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE, JAMIE. YEAH, YOU BETTER GET A MOVE ON. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THE BUS. Father: WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER. YEAH, DAD. LATER. THOSE BANANA SPLITS WERE A SET-UP, LIKE A PREMEDICATED CRIME. THE WORD IS PREMEDITATED. AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. LAST NIGHT'S ACTIVITIES DID NOT IN ANY WAY REPRESENT GENUINE CONCERN FOR US. SO WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE, JAMIE? A LIFE OF SCORN AND DEGRADATION OR MYSTERY AND ADVENTURE? YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES, JAMIE. YOUR TRUMPET CASE IS STILL PACKED. TO THE GREAT OUTDOORS AND A LIFE OF MYSTERY AND ADVENTURE. ALL RIGHT, JAMIE! ( loud whisper ) DON'T FORGET YOUR MONEY! WHAT? DON'T FORGET YOUR MONEY! WHAT-WHAT- WHAT MONEY? - HUH? - JUST KIDDING. Driver: STEP RIGHT UP. - MORNING, CLAUD. - HERBERT. - JAMIE. - HEY, HERB. MUSIC LESSONS TODAY, HUH? - YES! - HEY, BRUCE. HEY, JAMIE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY-- PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. NEVER HELPED ME ANY. Herb: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, HERE WE ARE. HAVE A GOOD ONE. Boy: BYE, HERBIE. - Girl: HAVE A NICE DAY, HERB. - BYE-BYE. ALL RIGHT, IS THAT EVERYBODY? ( siren wails ) - Man: GET A MOVE ON, HERB! - HOLD YOUR HORSES. MY CLUBS ARE GETTING COLD! I'M COMING. I'M JUST CLEANING UP THE MESS. Herb: THE WAY YOU PLAY GOLF, BOB, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE GLAD TO PUT IT OFF AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. WHAT'S THE RUSH? WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO TEE OFF LATE. I'M AN ACTOR. I HAVE TO MAKE A STOP-- WE'RE NOT STOPPING ANYWHERE. ( no sound ) ( siren wailing ) ISN'T THIS GREAT? YEAH. WHICH WAY ARE THE WOODS? - CLAUDIA? - COME ON. Jamie: DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE? NOT EXACTLY. BUT YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING, RIGHT? NOT FOR SURE. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HEADED SOUTH. IN BACK OF US IS NORTH, TO THE RIGHT IS WEST AND TO THE LEFT OF US IS EAST. I THINK THE WOODS ARE THAT WAY. THANK YOU, DANIEL BOONE. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. I JUST TOLD YOU THE WOODS ARE THAT WAY. ( horns honking ) I'M GETTING A LITTLE HUNGRY, JAMIE. ARE YOU HUNGRY? WHAT'S WRONG? UH, NOTHING. I'M JUST HUNGRY. ARE YOU HUNGRY? HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN GONE, ANYHOW? - JAMIE? - YEAH? YOU KNOW HOW MOM ALWAYS HAS A CUP OF COFFEE AT NOON? UH-HUH. WHY? ( sighs ) I LEFT THE NOTE INSIDE HER COFFEE FILTERS. IT'S 12:05. "AND DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CALL THE F.B.I. OR S.W.A.T. TEAMS OR ANY SUCH THING. WE'RE FINE. WE'RE UNDER OUR OWN STEAM AND WE'LL COME HOME WHEN WE'RE GOOD AND READY." IT'S TYPED, BUT SHE HANDWROTE HER NAME AND JAMIE'S... WITHOUT THE WORD "LOVE." YES, I'VE CALLED THEM. THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY. I KNOW THAT. IS THAT DAD? I NEED TO TALK TO HIM. WELL, JUST GET HERE AS SOON AS YOU CAN. WHAT'S GOING ON? YOUR FATHER AND THE POLICE WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. WHAT? CLAUDIA AND JAMIE HAVE RUN AWAY. OH, COOL. Jamie: ALL I'M SAYING IS NEXT TIME, DON'T GET A CHEESEBURGER. I DON'T LIKE PLAIN HAMBURGERS. THEN GET SOMETHING ELSE. IF YOU KEEP BUYING SPECIALTY ITEMS, WE'RE GONNA BE BROKE. YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE COLD IN THE WOODS. WHY DIDN'T WE PACK SLEEPING BAGS? 'CAUSE YOU KNOW, BURYING OURSELVES UNDER LEAVES AND MULCH, OR WHATEVER THE NATIVE AMERICANS USED, IS NOT GONNA KEEP US VERY WARM. MOST NATIVE AMERICANS SLEPT UNDER HIDES, JAMIE, OFTEN INSIDE TENTS. WE, HOWEVER, ARE NOT NATIVE AMERICANS NOR ARE WE SLEEPING IN THE WOODS. WE WILL BE SLEEPING IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM. BALONEY, WE WILL. YOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AN ADVENTURE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHERE MAYBE I CAN BE A HERO OR SOMETHING AND RESCUE A STRANDED HIKER. YOU SAID WE WERE GONNA LIVE OFF OF SPRING WATER, WILD BERRIES, AND BEAR MEAT! I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT BEAR MEAT, JAMIE. YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT SLEEPING IN SOME DUSTY MUSEUM EITHER. I'M NOT SLEEPING HERE, CLAUD! NO WAY! FINE. GO WHERE YOU WANT-- THE WOODS, BACK TO THE PLACE WE USED TO CALL HOME. FOR THAT MATTER, YOU CAN GO LIVE WITH BRUCE AND LOSE WHAT LITTLE I.Q. YOU'VE AMASSED THUS FAR. I MADE A DECISION AND I'M GONNA STICK TO IT. WELL, I GUESS I'LL BE SEEING YOU THEN. I GUESS. GOING SOMEWHERE? I NEEDED TO CHECK YOUR COMPASS. WELL, WHERE MY COMPASS GOES, I GO. ( sighs ) LOOK, JAMIE, I KNOW IT'S NOT THE WOODS, BUT IF YOU JUST THINK OF A MUSEUM AS A PLACE WITH SOUVENIRS FROM EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD, I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE AN ADVENTURE. I PROMISE WE WILL. YOU CAN'T EVER TELL ANYBODY I DID THIS. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE HERE? TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY-- IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE, JAMIE. BESIDES, WE'LL BE SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL THINGS. MOM'S GOT THAT QUILT HANGING UP ON THE WALL. DON'T YOU LIKE THAT? TWO, PLEASE. WE'RE MEETING OUR MOTHER INSIDE. - WHAT? - THE MONEY, JAMIE. THERE'S AN ADMISSION FEE. I'M NOT PAYING A DIME-- JAMIE... MONEY. PEOPLE ARE WAITING. TRUMPET CASE. BOOK BAG. COME ON! COAT. WELL, WHAT DID YOU GIVE THEM OUR STUFF FOR? DAD'S POCKETKNIFE IS IN THERE. THE ONE WITH THE SCISSORS AND NAIL CLIPPERS? I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA NEED IT. FOR A MANICURE IN THE WOODS? MY P.J.s WERE IN THERE TOO, YOU KNOW? RELAX. WE'LL GET THEM LATER. PEOPLE DON'T CARRY STUFF AROUND MUSEUMS. IT'S NOT ALLOWED. WONDER WHERE THE RESTROOMS ARE. I DON'T HAVE TO GO. NEITHER DO I. HERE. TAKE THESE. OH, HERE THEY ARE. THIS IS WHERE I'LL HIDE AND... THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL HIDE WHEN THEY CLOSE AND OPEN THE MUSEUM. YOU'LL GO IN A STALL AND STAND ON IT. STAND ON WHAT? YOU STAND ON THE TOILET, PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN, KEEP THE STALL DOOR SLIGHTLY OPEN. WHEN THE GUARDS CHECK THE BATHROOM, THEY LOOK UNDER THE DOORS FOR FEET. WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? SAW IT IN THE MOVIES. WE'LL STAY HIDDEN FOR 15 MINUTES. BY THEN THE GUARDS SHOULD BE GONE. WE'LL COME OUT-- SIMPLE. ACT NATURAL. HERE'S A GUARD COMING NOW. LOST? WELL, ACTUALLY-- ARRANGE TO MEET YOUR PARENTS AND NOW YOU CAN'T LOCATE THEM? THEY WON'T BE HAPPY WHEN THEY FIND YOU, YOU KNOW. THEY'LL ACT HAPPY BUT I GUARANTEE YOU'LL BE PUNISHED. WE'RE HERE WITH OUR COUSINS, AND THEY'RE USING THE LAVATORIES, AND WE WERE JUST, UM, FAMILIARIZING OURSELVES WITH WHAT EXHIBIT'S WHERE SO WE COULD MAXIMIZE OUR EXPERIENCE FOR OUR LIMITED TIME. SHE'S A TIME-SAVER. THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE TO BE GOING. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE MUSEUM WILL BE CLOSED AND THEN WE'D BE LOCKED IN AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT WE HAVE TO GO HOME AND COOK FOR OUR FAMILY OF EIGHT. BYE! Claudia: THIS IS FABULOUS, ISN'T IT? DIDN'T I TELL YOU THIS PLACE WAS GREAT? JUST A LOT OF OLD PAINTINGS AND STUFF. JAMIE, THIS ISN'T STUFF. THIS IS ART. ALL RIGHT, WHERE ARE WE GOING? ONCE WE FIND A PLACE TO SLEEP, WE'LL SCATTER OUR STUFF IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. THAT WAY IF THE MUSEUM GUARDS FIND ONE THING, THEY WON'T FIND THEM ALL. THEY GOT BEDS IN AN ART MUSEUM? BEDS ARE FURNITURE, JAMIE, AND FURNITURE'S ART. WHY DIDN'T I KNOW THAT? JAMIE? JAMIE! NOW THESE GUYS GOT THE RIGHT IDEA. THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. PLEASE, JAMIE. WILL YOU FORGET ABOUT THE WOODS? YOU KNOW, IF THAT ADMISSION FEE THING STARTS CUTTING INTO OUR FUNDS, I KNOW A WAY WE CAN GET MORE MONEY. - OH, YES? - YEAH! I COULD PLAY CARDS WITH THAT GUARD WE MET-- MORRIS. I BET I COULD WIN A WHOLE LOT OFF OF HIM. JAMIE, IF YOU PLAY CARDS WITH THE GUARD, HE'LL REMEMBER YOU. IF THE AUTHORITIES COME LOOKING FOR US, HE'D DESCRIBE YOU TO A TEE. THEY'D GET FINGERPRINTS FROM THE MONEY HE WON FROM YOU AND THEN WE'D BE IN HANDCUFFS BEFORE YOU COULD COUNT TO THREE. NOW JUST LOOK AT THIS PAINTING, JAMIE. ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL? YEAH. TERRIFIC. COME ON. THIS IS PERFECT, ISN'T IT? THIS IS WHERE WE'LL SLEEP. BUT IT SAYS NOT TO STAND ON THE PLATFORM. DOES IT SAY NOT TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME AND SLEEP IN MUSEUMS? AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT SAYS TO SLEEP IN THE WOODS. JAMES LINCOLN KINCAID, GET OFF THAT BED! THEY'RE GOING TO BE CLOSING SOON. LET'S GO. ( door opens ) ( door closes ) ( door opens ) ( whispering ) BREATHE, CLAUDIA. ( door closes ) ( door locking ) JAMIE? JAMIE? I'M HUNGRY. PRICE OF ADVENTURE. LET'S GET OUR THINGS. NO EATING IN BED. CLAUDIA. BOO! GIVE ME THAT. DIDN'T PUT A FLASHLIGHT ON THE LIST. - I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE IN THE WOODS-- - "IN THE WOODS." "STATE BED. SCENE OF THE ALLEGED MURDER OF AMY ROBSART, FIRST WIFE OF LORD ROBERT DUDLEY." HEY! A GIRL GOT KILLED IN THAT BED. ( sighs ) THAT'S A PORTRAIT OF LADY SCOFIELD. SHE WAS MARRIED TO A KING WHO CUT HER HEAD OFF. THEY SAY SHE WANDERED AROUND THE CASTLE WITH HER HEAD UNDER HER ARM. COOL. UH, I DIDN'T BRUSH MY TEETH. YOU WILL TOMORROW. WE'D BETTER GET SOME SLEEP IF WE'RE GOING TO WAKE UP BEFORE THE GUARDS COME BACK. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE TO FIND A REAL RESTAURANT TOMORROW, TOO. I FIGURE IF WE ORDER ONE HUMONGO MEAL AND SHARE IT, WE'LL SAVE MONEY THAT WAY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I THINK? THEY COULD NEVER GET MY FINGERPRINTS FROM MY MONEY. WHAT? YOU SAID THE AUTHORITIES WOULD GET MY FINGERPRINTS FROM THE MONEY THAT GUARD WOULD WIN FROM ME, BUT THEY NEVER WOULD BECAUSE HE'D NEVER WIN. WHY NOT? BECAUSE I CHEAT. YOU WHAT? THAT'S HOW COME I'M SO RICH. YOU CHEAT WHEN YOU PLAY CARDS WITH BRUCE? YEAH. BRUCE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND. I KNOW. IT'S KIND OF CREEPY IN HERE, DON'T YOU THINK? JAMIE, I KNOW A LOT OF THINGS ARE SCARY IN HERE, BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S ALL JUST MANUFACTURED AND THAT NOTHING IN HERE IS ALIVE OR CAN HURT YOU OR AFFECT YOU IN ANY WAY. AND IF YOU REALLY CAN'T SLEEP, WE CAN SIT UP AND TALK FOR A WHILE UNTIL YOU FEEL RELAXED, OKAY? JAMIE? 'NIGHT, JAMIE. ( gasps ) JAMIE! JAMIE, WAKE UP. IT'S 9:00. MY ALARM DIDN'T GO OFF. WHERE ARE WE? IN A BED WHERE A MURDER TOOK PLACE AND ANOTHER ONE'S GOING TO IF YOU DON'T GET UP AND PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON. ( footsteps approach ) QUICK, JAMIE, GET UNDER THE COVERS! - Man: HEY, JERRY! - WHAT? COME AND CHECK THE BOTTICELLI! WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? I THINK IT'S COMING OFF THE WALL. YEAH, LIKE THE RUBENS LAST WEEK. JAMIE, WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! SO WHO WON THE GAME LAST NIGHT? Man: WE DID, MAN. IT WAS GREAT. OVER HERE. Man: AHEM. THE MUSEUM OPENS AT 10:00, SO HIDE UNTIL 10:15. THAT'S WHEN REGULAR PEOPLE LIKE US WILL BE ALL OVER. THAT'S WHEN TO COME OUT AND MEET ME ON THE FRONT STEPS. HERE. I DON'T WANT TO BRUSH MY TEETH. I WANT TO EAT. EAT SOME TOOTHPASTE FIRST. AS SOON AS THE MUSEUM OPENS, WE'LL GET SOME FOOD, ALL RIGHT? ( thudding ) WHERE DID YOU COME FROM? UH, MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID HEAVEN, BUT THEN YOU HEAR ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT CABBAGES AND THE STORK. OH, NO! IT'S MORRIS. THIS A SCHOOL HOLIDAY? NO, SIR. BUT I LEFT MY VIOLIN CASE IN THERE. AND IT'S MY MUSIC DAY TODAY AND MY MOM'S WAITING IN THE CAR OUT THERE. WHERE IS IT? - WHERE'S WHAT? - YOUR VIOLIN CASE. SEE, WE THOUGHT SHE LEFT IT INSIDE, BUT IT TURNS OUT IT'S AT HOME. AND MOM'S GONNA HAVE A COW. SO SEE YA. WHAT'S YOUR NAMES? UH, HIS NAME'S RALPH. AND HER NAME'S EMILY! BYE! THERE YOU GO. WE GOT TO BUY SOME MORE FOOD FOR TONIGHT. AFTER ALL OF THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO BE HUNGRY? Man: PICK UP 17. SOME COOKIES AND MORE CHIPS. YEAH. AND SOME FRUIT. MMM. CAKE. YEAH. DEFINITELY CAKE. FRUIT! RODENTS EAT FRUIT, YOU KNOW. THANK YOU. JAMIE. WHAT? LET'S GO. LEAVE IT, JAMIE. I SAID LEAVE IT. IF WE WERE IN THE WOODS, NO ONE WOULD SEE US AT ALL. WRONG, EINSTEIN. IF WE WERE IN THE WOODS, WE'D BE FROZEN SOLID. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE'D BE COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY DEAD. NOW COME ON. GREAT. NOW IT'S GONNA TAKE US HOURS TO GET BACK IN. BALONEY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY. COME ON. EXCUSE ME. I'M ON A FIELD TRIP WITH A BUNCH OF STUDENTS WAY BACK THERE. WE'RE HERE TO APPRECIATE FINE ART, BUT ON ACCOUNT OF MY LEG BEING BROKE IN 10 PLACES, MY TEACHER, MRS. HINEBURGER, WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WAS OKAY BY YOU IF I WENT IN AND SAT DOWN 'CAUSE I CAN'T STAND FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. AND, UH, THIS IS EVELYN, OUR STUDENT AIDE. SHE CAME WITH ME BECAUSE I MIGHT BE A LITTLE IRRESPONSIBLE. YOUR LEG WAS BROKE IN 10 PLACES? IT WAS AN AWESOME BIKE ACCIDENT. HEY, I STILL HAVE THE PIN. WANT TO SEE? NO, THAT'S FINE. YOU CAN GO IN. IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEM AT THE DOOR, JUST TELL THEM CORA SAID IT'S OKAY. THANKS. HEY, DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY DIED? MAYBE THEY'RE INTERVIEWING A GREAT ARTIST. MAYBE A GREAT ARTIST DIED. Man: EXCUSE US, PLEASE. EXCUSE US. THANK YOU. SORRY. BUT... ( sniffs ) EW. FRUITY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YUCKY ON YOUR SHOE. YES, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN. SOMEBODY HERE HAS VERY BAD MANNERS. DO I MAKE YOU NERVOUS? NO, MA'AM. I HAVE A SISTER. I'M USED TO WEIRD STUFF. I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT SO BAD. WELL, THANKS. PARKS. ARE YOU HERE TO SEE THE SCULPTURE? UH, I GUESS SO. WELL, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT. I THINK YOU WILL. WHAT SCULPTURE? I DON'T KNOW. LET'S FIND OUT. THE EXPERTS CAN'T AGREE. IT'S EITHER AN EARTH-SHATTERING DISCOVERY OR AN ABSOLUTE PHONY. WELL, IF IT IS BY MICHELANGELO, IT WOULD BE WORTH MILLIONS. HEY, WHO'S MIKE D. ANGELO? MICHELANGELO. DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING? IT SAYS HERE THAT NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE WHO MADE THIS STATUE. IT'S A REAL MYSTERY. THE MYSTERY IS WHY WE'RE STANDING IN THIS LINE. SHH. Woman: PLEASE KEEP MOVING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE SO BEAUTIFUL. IT'S MORRIS! DUCK! WHEW. JAMIE... LOOK. Woman: PLEASE MOVE THROUGH. ( whispering ) WE CAN COME BACK LATER. WE HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL NOW ABOUT THE GUARDS AND TALKING TO STRANGERS. NOW THAT WE HAVE A JOB TO DO, WE MIGHT BE HERE LONGER THAN I PLANNED. WHAT JOB DO WE HAVE TO DO? OUR JOB, LITTLE BROTHER, IS TO PERFORM A SERVICE FOR MANKIND, TO REVEAL THE ABSOLUTE AND IRREFUTABLE TRUTH. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT TRUTH IS, JAMIE? THAT YOU HAVE A WEIRD PERSONALITY? THE TRUTH IS, THAT SCULPTURE, THAT PERFECT MASS OF HANDCRAFTED STONE, IS EITHER THE WORK OF THE GREAT ARTIST MICHELANGELO OR IT ISN'T. THERE'S NO IN BETWEEN. I'M GOING TO SOLVE THAT MYSTERY, JAMIE, AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME. I FOUND IT, JAMIE. NO WAY! WHAT WE SAW-- WHAT WE SAW ON THE BOTTOM OF THE STATUE WAS MICHELANGELO'S STONEMASON'S MARK. EVERY SCULPTURE HE MADE HAD IT STAMPED ON IT SOMEWHERE. I LOOKED THROUGH A THOUSAND BOOKS TO FIND IT. SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME... IS THE ANGEL IS WORTH MILLIONS? NO, JAMIE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT MONEY. THIS IS ABOUT ART. AND ART IS THE MAGIC THAT COMES FROM GREATNESS. SO IF MICHELANGELO REALLY DID CARVE THE ANGEL, THEN THAT ANGEL'S MAGIC TOO. Claudia: THAT'S RIGHT, MR. JORDAN. I'M SURE THIS IS A FINDING OF REAL SIGNIFICANCE-- A REAL BREAKTHROUGH-- AND I'D LIKE TO MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO DISCUSS THE MATTER. TOMORROW AT 4:00? YES. I THINK I CAN BE AVAILABLE THEN. YES. AND THANK YOU. THIS IS HISTORY IN THE MAKING, JAMIE. TOMORROW, I SHALL MEET WITH THE CURATOR OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM TO DISCUSS THE LEGITIMACY OF MY FINDINGS. JAME, THIS IS TRULY FANTASTIC. Claudia: I BET IF MICHELANGELO DID MAKE THAT ANGEL, HE CARVED IT FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL, PROBABLY A ROYAL PRINCE OR SOMETHING, FOR A WEDDING PRESENT. YEAH, WELL, I BET HE MADE HER FOR AN ANGEL STORE. THEY PROBABLY HAD 'EM IN THOSE DAYS. I DON'T THINK SO, JAMIE. YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A BATH IN THIS? ABSOLUTELY. HEY. WHAT'S THIS? WE'RE RICH, CLAUD! THIS FOUNTAIN IS FILLED WITH MONEY! THAT MONEY'S NOT OURS ANY MORE THAN THE MONEY YOU CHEAT FROM BRUCE IS YOURS, JAMIE. I GUESS NOT. ( water splashes ) WHY DO PEOPLE THROW MONEY INTO FOUNTAINS ANYWAY? TO MAKE A WISH. YEAH, WELL, I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE A BATH IN THAT FOUNTAIN. AND I WISH YOU'D JUST GET IN. WE HAVE TO LOOK OUR BEST FOR TOMORROW'S MEETING, JAMIE. BALONEY. YOU HAVE TO LOOK YOUR BEST. I'M GONNA BE DOWN THE STREET AT THE ARCADE. BALONEY. YOU'RE GONNA BE MY LOOKOUT, JAMIE. COME ON. HERE'S SOME SOAP FROM HOME. LET'S GET IN. HERE. I COULD FREEZE IN THERE, YOU KNOW. THEN WE'LL BOTH FREEZE. COME ON. ( sighs ) SEE? IT'S NOT SO BAD. HOW MANY PEOPLE GET TO BATHE IN A REAL LIVE FOUNTAIN? YOU REALIZE THIS IS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE, DON'T YOU? YEAH, I GUESS SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY WISH? THAT WE COULD KEEP ALL THIS MONEY? JUST WASH, JAMIE. - YOU WASH. - JAMIE! - STOP THAT! - YOU STOP THAT! NO! STOP THAT! DID PAPA KINCAID EVER TELL YOU YOU HAD A GOOD LUCK CHARM? UH-HUH. WHY? WELL, HE SAID MINE WAS AN ANGEL. CLAUD? YOU IN THERE? CLAUDIA? CLAUDIA? ( door closes ) ( TV playing softly ) CLAUD? IS THAT YOU? Man: HEY, THIS IS ABOUT THE MUSEUM. TURN IT UP, WILL YOU? Female anchor: ...has arisen from the belief that it may be the work of the Italian Renaissance master Michelangelo. The statue was auctioned anonymously, but is now believed to have come from the collection of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, who currently resides in Nielsen Heights. Now back to the newsroom. And on the local scene today, the Kincaid family, whose children have been missing for the last three days, held a press conference today appealing for their safe return. We'd just like to say that... if someone's taken our children, please let them go. And, uh... Claudia and Jamie, if you ran away like your letter says... please come home. We're having a very hard time without you. HOPE THOSE KIDS ARE OKAY, HUH? Woman: CHILDREN, CHILDREN, IT'S TIME TO LEAVE... - WHOA! - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU FOR AN HOUR. YOU WEREN'T WHERE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE. AND YOUR VIOLIN CASE IS GONE. AND ANYWAY, HOW COME YOU'RE WEARING ALL THIS STUFF? IT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU. NO, BUT YOU DO. JAMIE, WE HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE MEETING. NOT ANOTHER BATH. Claudia: SO I COULDN'T USE THE BATHROOM BECAUSE IT HAD REPAIR PEOPLE IN IT AND THE ONLY OTHER ROOM THAT WASN'T LOCKED WAS LOST AND FOUND WHICH, BELIEVE ME, WAS SERENDIPITOUS BECAUSE I NEEDED SOMETHING TO WEAR FOR THE MEETING TODAY. THEN I WENT TO PUT MY TOOTHBRUSH AWAY. THE CLEANING CREW WAS ABOUT TO COME IN SO I GRABBED MY VIOLIN CASE AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW YOU... LUCKILY. WHAT? I SAW MOM AND DAD ON T.V. TODAY. YOU WANT TO GO HOME, DON'T YOU? I KIND OF GOT THE SHIVERS, AND I ACHE A LITTLE TOO. JAMIE, IF WE GO HOME BEFORE THE MYSTERY IS SOLVED, THEY STILL WON'T APPRECIATE ME. AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, THEY'LL BE FURIOU
