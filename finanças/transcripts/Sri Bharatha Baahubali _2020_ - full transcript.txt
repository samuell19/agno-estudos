There is no such thing as loyalty at all. In spite of having a lover, they'll keep eyeing their lover's friends too. She is not as good-looking as you, That's why she's jealous. Are you upset that I didn't hug you. I love you, come let's hug! Who the hell are you? What is it girls? What happened? Look brother, he's come to our village and he is behind us to fall in love with him. Trash him properly! Which village are you from? Do you care for your life? You become a hero later! First did you hear what she just said? She addressed you as brother. I am like a brother. To all the women folk in our village, I am a brother! If you cast an eye on our woman we will never spare anyone! Don't you push me. You are showing of thinking I have come alone? Do you know who is with me? Bharatha! Come here, where are you going? Come here, come! Brother, Brother,why should we fight amongst ourselves. Let's compromise! Now you are not the only brother to these two, I am also their brother. See brother... I'm your brother! I'm your brother! Don't you come to hug me, He has already hugged thrice. Did you hug thrice? Where, where is Bharatha? Hit him, hit him! Don't let him go guys! Don't let him go guys! Climb, climb on dude! Look at him, getting away. Shankara, he's getting away, see! Not only her, I will fall in love with your sister too! Do what you can! Go fast dude! Satisha, Near the village entrance, two guys are coming on a Yamaha bike... Block them! Baahubali, Come, come! Let's get more guys from our village! Come or they will hit us up! Don't go, come! Go, it's your funeral! Santhu, one of the guys escaped and has boarded a bus! The bus is heading towards the village, Don't spare him. Lock him! Stand the hell up! What, you are sitting and dreaming? We've also been observing since then, You have taken the spanner and unscrewing something. Stand the hell up! What the hell were you sitting down and unscrewing? Stupid guy! What is happening guys? Brother, he eve-teased our village girls and is trying to escape. So, does that mean you'll fight amongst yourselves? Why do you have a Panchayat in the village? Bring him there, let's decide there. We don't want the Panchayat. Brother, spoken in like a true man! Why is that even a Panchayat then? Let's go! What is it? It's a love case. Let them be then, chill guys! Do you even know what you're saying? There is a boy and a girl Who have seen each other and approve of each other, Then it's a done deal. Why are you guys coming in between? Spoken like a true man! Isn't it so? Are we born to dogs? Isn't it so? We've put you in the position of a leader, We must first take you down! How will we change our leader? There is some sense in what he's saying. What sense are you talking about? Supporting and talking in favor of the neighboring village! Is it done? Just because your leader is horny, Do you think all the rest are like him? You have asked this correctly man! Who are you calling horny? Who are you telling this to? Why are you acting big? Hit them guys! Don't spare them! Don't spare them! Hit him! Hit him! See him! Don't spare him! See, who he is! Stop right there! Wait, I'll do the talking. You go! Ask her properly! You go! What now? You don't speak! It's all because of you! You lit the spark and the fireworks started there! Any guy trying to fall in love with a girl will have a friend like you, To create trouble! What I have done so far, that is unusual? I fell in love, that is it, right? No, no, he's fallen in love! Isn't that it? What's wrong with that? If you want, say yes or say no, it would have gotten over! We are roaming behind you daily, right? You think your dad is filling up the petrol? There is no need for any Panchayat, okay? Do you like him, do you love him, tell right now, that's it! She should be capable of speaking, to open her mouth and said it? What? She can't speak. What is she trying to say? She's not in love or anything with anyone. She's not in love or anything with anyone. If her dad gets to hear of this, He will pull her out of college and get her married. Somehow she is at the dad's brother's house and studying. Kindly let her be to herself! This was what she said. Did she say okay? Dude, she is not interested in love and all, Her father will not agree, it seems! Just let her be dude! Be quiet. It is you I am in love with, Not your father! Just tell me you like me once! I will hit your father and take you. She is dumb. Why are you getting worked up? Look, if you don't like me just open your mouth and tell me directly. Making these bomb noises doesn't scare me at all! Dumb means... One who can't speak. She can't speak dude. No dude. You don't break your head, If you like me, just tell me, Even if you cannot speak. I will marry you. Silence now... What's the point in remembering the past. What am I lacking man, am I not enough? She had to go fall in love with that dwarf! I have updated her. She's ready to elope. So she is ready to elope, is she? Now, at this moment, if I tell her, she is ready to run away! Do you have any doubt? No man, not at all. There are tears in your eyes! The thought of your love story pierced my gut! That's why my eyes are pumping water. So then tomorrow... Shall I get ready for the wedding? Fine, get ready! Let's see who is going to oppose it, We will get you married! Your eyes are also watering? It's because of the smoke, man! get lost! Due to smoke? Are your eyes burning? Yes. I know why you're crying? Why? You think I don't know this much. It's because I am crying That you are unable to hold your sorrow and you are in tears! Friendship... That's right man! This is why it is called friendship. How many knots do I tie? You... You are 3 feet tall, so tie it three times! You don't worry about anything, these guys are here for us.

Such women! The villagers said you were in the prison, but I assumed they were talking due to jealousy and did not believe them! You should believe it when people talk about someone's doom! That's free publicity but when we are successful, we ourselves have to put it as a Facebook Status and get likes, paid publicity! Why did you need all of this? Getting someone's daughter married?

You must have died accidentally. You must be getting your memory back. In this universe, the earth has a special place. To every form of life born on this earth, birth and death are a certainty. As such, man too is born and dies and is reborn. This is all about my past life in Russia's experience. After I realized that I too have a life in the past, videos about past life, I started watching. I read a lot of books as well. All my dream related things were in India, in Karnataka, I realized...

A well... water, all of these why are they coming in my dream, I don't know! I decided to find out about all this! Did you finish? Peter please, Peter doesn't believe in all this. After that, chasing my dreams I have come till here. I want to know how I died, my past life, if my family members are still alive. To find out all this, I have come here...

Guess who that is? Who's that? Mother, who's in that photo, you only tell her! Come dear... The girl in this photo, is my daughter Geetha. When she was two years old, this picture was clicked. When she left us, She was six! She was lost in the Baahubali fair! There's no place that we have not searched for her! Even though we searched everywhere, we did not find her! Finally she was found in a well, as a dead body! Her innocent face, her smiling face, I am unable to forget even now! Suffering in her memories my husband had a stroke and is bedridden! He was the only earning member of the family. Selling everything we had, we are somehow living! Your daughter is reborn and is searching for us! After we came to know this I am unable to believe this! The priest used to tell us... 'Don't grieve, 'Don't grieve, your daughter will be reborn and return to you! Geetha... After looking at you, My inner voice is saying... My daughter My daughter is reborn for my sake! Geetha! I can feel it, You are my mother. Dear, She is our daughter Geetha, She has been reborn to meet us, She's our little one dear. Dad. .. Wearing green shorts, With pockets filled with marbles... You used to play in the mud girl.... Now how tall you have grown! Keeping an ice cream in your mouth! Holding money in your hand! You used to swing on the trees... Now you have grown like a tree! Your endearing words Listening to them, I spent my time... These sweet kisses of yours, On getting them, I pushed my days... Daily, in your loving embrace... Daily, in your loving embrace...

Already your dad has a stroke, Your mom is a crack! Crack? After you were lost, She had a mental breakdown. Now little by little, she's recovering. Taking a stroll in the village, and at night, sleeping amidst nature is what will help, as per the doctor, isn't it? Yes! But if I leave her here, who will take care of her? For that only, aren't we here? Do you need someone better than us? About our helping nature, don't you know? The foreign land will be like a golden prison for them, Isn't it so, sister? In our village, many parents live like this Shri. Their kids are all settled abroad. Once in every three years or five years they do come. Either New Years of The Festival of Lights they celebrate, take a Selfie and return. But without fail, without fail, they transfer money into their account! Isn't it so sister? Yes dear daughter, We don't need foreign and the such. We found you, that's more than enough. Be careful! As soon as you uttered that See how happy your father is! Due to this happiness, he may recover his ability in both his arm and mouth. Your daughter won't go anywhere, just sleep, sleep! Why are you lifting yourself up aggressively? Is it due to happiness? Then? Don't worry mom, I will go abroad, consult the doctors, and will arrange for the best treatment, I'm with you. A daughter fit for her mother! Hi dad! Hi Shri!

You can speak later, finish your drink quickly, shut up and leave! Tony! Come here! Brother. Brother. I asked you what the problem was, did we ask you to drink? Brother, They have made me take on both the roles brother. I'm both the cameraman and the reporter too brother! My mother isn't well, bro! I will go to the village and return, give me a day's off, when I asked thus... These guys said, give news that will suffice for a day and then go, brother. From where shall I bring the news bro? Oh, please don't cry, don't cry, don't cry dude! Give me news! Tell me, give me one news guys! These newsmakers have many stories within them dude... Poor guys, they are only saying other's stories that no one listen to their story! Hi Dad, Good morning! Hi! Dear... Dear, your hand has been cured dear! Yes, yes! Shri, how magical! Your dad's hand and his mouth too have been cured. Can you guys please stop it! I have never seen such tremendous actors in my life! Don't act smart! I will make your hand like this for the rest of your life. Thrash him, thrash him a few times. Why did you behave like this? I trusted you so much. We told them that we would not do so, but those Bharatha and Baahubali convinced us by showing money! Every month money will come in is what they said and convinced us. We thought you will not realize so soon, how did you find out? You cannot cheat everyone, all the time! Peter, let's go. Good acting, keep it up! Crazy guys! You stupid guy! Frauds! Frauds are not born, they are made! After hearing your stupid past life story, did we get this idea! I don't need your explanation. Now get lost! Where should we go? the pump house is ours, pay the rent and you go! What's the rent? It's 10,000 per day what? What? 10,000? Why are you giving rent to these frauds? They have been to jail and India needs more jails for guys like this. All Indians are frauds! Don't you talk about our India! Peter, do not speak about India like that! Why are you supporting Indians? I'm an Indian! You... You are an Indian? Dad, dad? Are you there? Shri, they are not your parents, someone is fooling you. Dad, are you serious? Did you actually lie to me? Didn't our astrologer agree to it? Sorry dear! It was we who made the astrologer lie to you... The truth is that you are not our daughter! Mom, what are you talking about? Who am I if I'm not your daughter? You are from India... We found you in a well! While we were travelling in India We saw that incident! Someone was trying to kill you! It may have been your father itself... Because, then in India, female infanticide were in vogue... We protected you, and got you with us! As you had a huge wound on your head you lost your memory power! That is why we had kept that incident a secret! We did not want you to recollect it and feel the pain, that's why we lied! Sorry dear, So, You are an Indian! I'm I... When I saw her itself I thought that she is born to some Indian. Seeing her fair hands and legs, Seeing her fair hands and legs, I thought she is a foreigner! Which place are you from? Tell me properly, in all possibility, you may end up being my aunt's daughter! I don't know, I still need to find out! I don't know, I still need to find out! You still have to find out, with these guys? It's okay, no problem, stay with these guys. I thought only they are frauds but now I realize, it's your mother, your father, your entire family! Peter enough! Do not speak about my parents! I will talk, then why did they lie to you, your entire family are frauds! Enough is enough Peter, get out of my life! Okay, I will leave. Go! I will never come back. go to hell! I'm leaving tomorrow, Is there any payment left? I will pay you, anything else? It's not your fault, it's all my mistake. I should never have trusted you! But I want to ask you one thing! Do you know the meaning of sacrifice? You have named yourself Bharatha and Baahubali, you guys are not worth your names! Please change it. Why are you guys laughing? Their stories, do you even know? The entire world which was won by war by the Prince of Ayodhya, Bharatha Chakravarthy his brother Baahubali's Bodhanapura kingdom he wished to conquer and become the emperor! Directing Baahubali to leave his kingdom and surrender he sends a message. Provoked by Bharatha's arrogance and swank of Baahubali, invites his brother to the battlefield. Both agree to fight the battle. Due to these two people's act of war, innocent soldiers and animals would become victims thinking thus, the ministers of both the kingdoms arrange for a face off just between these two. As per that, the first one was... The battle of sight; Baahubali's intense sight couldn't be faced by Bharatha accepts defeat in the battle of sight. Next was the battle in the water, in front of Baahubali's immense strength, Bharatha gets defeated here too. The next one that happened was wrestling. Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Even in wrestling, while on the path of victory, Baahubali became aware of the reality. Who was the enemy he was wrestling with? The kingdom he had to set out to win, was after all whose? Brother! His brother! King Bharatha was his very own sibling! She was his own sister-in-law! In the midst of people's victory cries too... Baahubali remembers his brother's egotistical affection. The brother who shared the same blood with him, for the sake of a ridiculous kingdom, for an impermanent position did I wrestle with my own brother! Gold, woman, mud... In these illusions, losing myself trying to toss and kill my own brother! What an inexcusable sinner I am? With the guilt of a criminal, putting his brother down, Baahubali hesitated to even look at his brother's face. His kingdom, wealth, position and everything else, to hand over to his brother he took the decision! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali's internal conflict eclipsed Bharatha to kill him, he used his wheelbarrow! Baahubali, who was already on the of asceticism, the wheelbarrow circumambulated Baahubali thrice and vanished. As per his deep inner voice, giving up his kingdom, giving it to his brother, Baahubali renounced everything, became an ascetic. He became immortal! Open the door dear! Ankita! Ankita! Ankita! Open the door please! Ankita! What are you doing? Open the door daughter! Open the door! Ankita! Ankita! Ankita! Ankita! Open the door dear! I beg of you, please open the door dear. She isn't opening the door. Ankita! Ankita! What are you doing? Leave me! Get down! Leave me! Why? What happened? What happened? What happened daughter? What are you trying to do my dear?! What happened, tell me daughter... Selection, is it? At the border, we shall meet... If let be, you are just cow dung... If patted together, you become cowpat, If sprayed on lands, you became a fertilizer, If burned, you become sacred ashes... To whom do you belong... Oh! Human! To whom do you belong... Oh! Human! The clouds melt down... Raindrops start falling, The earth drinks in the rain... Farms start sprouting! What is your contribution here? Oh! Human! The secret of birth is here... Deaths get wrapped up here... Don't search for anything! You will find nothing! Fulfill your duties and exit honorably! If let be, you are just cow dung... If patted together, you become cowpat, If sprayed on lands, you became a fertilizer, If burned, you become sacred ashes... Thunder strikes! The body ruptures! Flames surge! Floods engulf us! You will not be able to withstand, puny human! You don't dream... Work hard every day! Don't build towards anything! Be giving and forgiving! No one can forget your sacrifice! If let be, you are just cow dung... If patted together, you become cowpat, If sprayed on lands, you became a fertilizer, If burned, you become sacred ashes... Dad, I'm coming back. All that is fine... But how did you get out? My lover got me out Oh! my, Anu is it? Her husband spoke on my behalf and got me released. The ex-lover out, he took a neutral stand and got released! â€¨ Who is that generous man? A What is it? You really think are classless like you? It is a foreign brand... Have it! Always you used to drink local brands... Directly you moved to a foreign brand! This is how it is now!! It's from foreign money right? That's why! Bharatha, where were you? Remembered you ten times since then! It's smelling heavenly, sip it! Apart from making me drink, what else would you do? At the Pump house, you have earned so much! I swear on you, I have not even earned a pie bro... That wretched one, without informing me, she just left! Looks like you have started a new business? About foreign and the such, you are talking? Take me in too. Since my return from the prison, no one is even coming near me! Even while I go to shop coriander, they look at me as if they have seen a gangster! It's great, let it be dude! Hereafter we shall demand protection money! You haven't anyway grown physically, at least we will help you grow socially, isn't it man? Using someone, Crushing someone, to whatever height we grow, what's the use? People may just rate you, but will never give you a rating! Just because I drank without you, why are talking rubbish? Shri is going back! What's your problem? I have given the Pump house money to Baahubali, what's with you now? Sorry Shri. It's OK, didn't I tell you right then, it's all my fault. I'm returning now, So please let me go! It's not your mistake Shri, the mistake is all ours! For the sake of money it is true that we tried to cheat you, but only later did I realize that I'm incapable of cheating properly! Shri, just give me one more chance, I'll search and find your family! Not required, neither do you have to search, nor do I want my family to be found. I don't trust you guys anymore! We, who were in prison after committing a crime, Why did you get us out? Even then we had committed a mistake, right? Although the whole village was talking negatively about us you trusted us, shall I tell u why? To believe your past life story, there was none then! But we believed you! We acted as if we believed it, hence you trusted us. After being cheated once, who will believe you guys again? Do you think I'm dumb? After murdering and being in prison, due to good conduct they have been released, Such examples are there too! Like that, give us a chance too Shri. I will show you to what extent a man can be honest! Please, not even a rupee need you pay! I will be with you, searching and finding your family is my responsibility. Please! Give me a chance Shri! At least from now on, we will lead a good life man. Let's live in a way that we are useful to someone. I have promised her that I will search and find her family! I don't need a rupee is what I said. Please help me do that bro... We will do that dude, We will surely do that! But not what you have come here to convince me! Then? She loves me man After drinking, don't blabber whatever you want! You can't understand, stay quiet! That day when I was giving her the Machine House key she was hiding a nd watching me only! Who do I have other than her? I'm single and she is single too! Now I go in the Machine House and we both will mingle! Where are you going man? Sweetheart, where are you? Who is haunting my mind... They are immersed in love, why are your eyes immersed in tears? Due to the smoke man! When do we collect Protection money? Protection money! You want Protection money! What happened Shri? I made a mistake! Baahubali, why are you crying? I made a mistake! Just a minute. Take this! What is this? The money you had given me... Everything was spent of that and only this much is remaining, keep it! Your debt, how do I repay, I don't know! In the next birth, I will be born as your lover. Baahubali, what are you saying? Just shut up, Your English should get entangled in my sandals! Now that you know that you are born to Kannada folk? talk in Kannada. I have a personal matter, don't tell anyone? What is it? My dad drinks daily, I too drink every day, you too learn! Slowly teach my mom too. On weekends, all four of us together, can drink to the fullest! My house is a bit small, you will have to adjust with it. You will adjust right, in this machine house you are already living like Queen Elizabeth! Later in our house, you can like a deer, run around, drink and fall off. You didn't understand anything, right? I don't know. I didn't understand anything. Okay! I will manage. Rape! Rape attempt! Under no circumstances should you show her your face! If this matter is known in the village, do you know what will happen? I will fall to your feet, only if someone tells it will someone in the village know... I will also not talk about it, you too don't talk about it! It's about my respect and standing. Please dude! I may be quiet, will she be quiet? First of all she is a foreigner! If a case is lodged, you will be permanently stuck inside. Only when you commit a mistake, will one be punished; The mistake that I have done, I will correct it myself. The pot that I made a hole in, I will only drink, let it be dude! What are you saying dear? To her, I will give a life! Bro, let her go man! You are not at fault here man! I simply cooked up stories man. Hoping you will stay away from her, I did this, that's all! She's mine dude, I love her dude... Please man, just leave her man! Get up Bharatha, get up! Opulence is for the rich happiness is for the poor! Life is as given to us by God, Longevity is in the hands of the God of death! Outcome of our toil is decided by the mud, fate is decided by the almighty! What is yours here, my man? She is mine, she is mine, you are saying, you can marry her and go to hell! Love is just for three days and wishes are only for six days. You mad men! In this meaningless life on earth A woman is like the top of a cliff, A black cloud from somewhere covered this world, When will humanity progress... Hi Shri! My entire family, And all my relatives... And all my friends Are telling me one thing Shri... 'Settle down in life, Bharatha, settle down in life!' So... I have decided Shri, to settle down in life. If you say yes, we could talk to Mudde Gowda go through the marital rituals and get married in a simple way! Or if you want it to be grand we could have a reception in foreign Anything is fine with me! Although we cheated you so much, if have still stayed back here, it's for me Shri, I know Shri. Hope you understand. Hope you understand. Oh, illusion! What an Illusion! Gunda! No dear, Why are you beating me thus? I will turn the illusion into reality, wait and see! I... Hi! Hi! Whose eye are they? These eyes appear in my dream. When I see these eyes they scare me! It has a criminal look, see... Whose ever eye you see, can you understand the feelings behind it? About face reading, I have read, so to an extent I can understand, Why? Look at my eyes and tell, What do you feel? You have come here to tell me something. Come on, tell me what is it? If I had so much guts, I would have married and had kids by now! Do you have an inferiority complex? Girls mostly put up an act, Shri! Not everything has to be verbally expressed. They understand everything, Still they expect to hear it verbally! Some cannot express, to them, they say good bye and leave What kind of girls? What are you talking about? I don't understand anything! Close by is a temple called Devirama Temple. There anything that we ask for, will come true it seems. I came to take you there. This is what I came here to tell you. No, no! You are not here to tell me that, There's something else. Bharatha! You are hiding something. Tell me what is it? I have already told you, I hope you understand! Bye... In my eyes, in my eyes... I loved you when I set my eyes on you... In my heart, in my heart... In my heart, in my heart... I worshipped you, from far... Do we need words, Those are just to advertise love... Do we need poetry? That is how imagination goes... In my eyes, in my eyes... I loved you when I set my eyes on you... To understand love... Do you need a degree? To draw emotions... Do you need a brush? Does the fish that swims in the water, ever say 'I Love You'? Does the bird that flies in the sky, ever say 'I Miss You'? Do you need languages? This love is irresistible! Do you need religions? This love has crossed borders! In my eyes, in my eyes... I loved you when I set my eyes on you... To the heart, a mirror... Do you need to hold? For love, a prelude... Does it need to be written? Does the bee sitting on the flower... Ever say, 'How Sweet Are You'! Does the life born on this earth... Ever say, 'I Thank You'! Is it not only in silence? There exists a feeling of gratitude? Is it not only in the heart? That we bestow ourselves as a flower? In my eyes, in my eyes...

An illusion! An illusion! An illusion! An illusion! An illusion! An illusion! An illusion! An illusion! An illusion! An illusion! Look Shri! In our village, this is the only ruined well! In your dream the one that appears, check if this is it. Bharatha, I'm pretty sure, This is the well. It is! Who's that kid? Come, come! Come to the side, Move, move, Sir is coming. All of you move back! Come, come! Come sir! Take the children to the back lady. Move back! All of you move back! Move, move! Take them. I'm telling, Can't you hear? Move, move, Move back, move back everyone! Lady, to you, Should I specially tell? Move to that side woman! Go, go back! Move, move! Go man! How many times to yell to you? Move, to you only I'm telling. Move, to you only I'm telling. Why did you come near the well? Sir, when she was a kid, In the same well, They tried killing her. After coming near the well, Her past, she was able to recall. that child's body has been identified. That child is theirs sir. Yess, I am able to remember that face very well, I can draw! Just like he did the to the baby, He trired to kill me! Sir, that child's body has been identified. That child is theirs sir. On the body, on seeing these clothes, she identified sir. Since the fishes have eaten away the face is unrecognizable We are unable to identify it. That child is yours only. Yess sir! In the fair, the child was lost sir! Mama! Sir, however much we searched, we couldn't find her sir. Now she's found like a corpse sir! See, this body has to be sent for post mortem and handed overto them. And tomorrow, the both of you, come to the station. Yes sir. Leave man! Leave man! Hello, Hello Bharatha! Please, please come soon please! Shri! Bharatha! Bharatha! Bharatha! There! Bharatha... Bharatha... You Bastard... Shri How's Shri now? Better sir, she is conscious now. What did the doctor say? Doctor, what has happened to her? It's a kind of phobia. The incident that happened in her childhood, has remained as it is in her sub-conscious mind! To the police, since she has given information about that criminal, What if he attacks me again is the fear that is haunting her. It was that fear, that helped her to identify him. At the right time, since you too went there, Along with you, she thinks she has caught him! Bharatha! There... But about that criminal, did you get any information? Turn around... Have a look at the cell. Sir, he? As the doctor said, Shri's imagining him and him coming to attack Shri is true. What are you saying sir? It is only after Shri drew his picture, It is only after Shri drew his picture, that we started searching for him. Getting to know this, again he has tried to attack Shri and has come to try and kill her! On that day, since you came there, seeing you, he has tried to escape! Shri! aThen when I was in the patrol, he came right in front of my jeep. After bringing him from there, and after we thrashed him all the information he has spilt out! Seeing him after so many years, Shri is in shock. Even after he left from there, He was still there, is the illusion that gripped her! Also, all these things, please don't discuss with Shri. To the hospital, I will only come and meet her. Okay Sir. Thank you. Greetings sir... Greetings... How are you now? Better sir. If you would not have given information about him, I don't know how many more kids bodies would have fallen! Thanks a lot. It's OK! At fairs, he used to target children who were alone. You too, he has targeted in a similar way! Old reports of missing children, will it be available sir? All the complaint details, we will have the records with us! Bharatha, my parents too would have complained right? Sir, please sir? Can I check the old records? Shri, after you get discharged, do come to our station, I will have informed my staff to help you! Thank you sir. Instead of properly holding to your parents hands where the hell where are you roaming about? You are asking me to look for the file now? Among all these files, how should I find the file for you? When were you lost? During the time of Baahubali 12th Year Grand Anointment. It keeps occurring once every 12 years. When did you get lost, how do I know? Why is she talking like this? Sister seems to be all hot and bothered. We have to calm her down, wait, wait, wait! Sister, please come here to the side for a minute. How dare you call me to the side. I'll put a #metoo case on you! In spite of me calling you sister, you will do that? I called you to talk about the bribe There are CCTV cameras here you're trying to give it to my hand. Go... Go there to the second row and put it in the second file. Sister, Sister, Shall I put it here. Yes. Come here dear child, when did you get lost? During Baahubali 12th Year Grand Anointment. I found the file, look! In that year, this file has the names of children lost that year. Is there a Shri in this file? Shri, is it? There's nobody by the name Shri in this file child. It's has got only boys names here. Mostly your parents have not lodged a complaint then Shri. Don't be upset! It's my bad luck. In a week's time my visa will expire. If I find them by then it's okay, otherwise I will never come back. Please do something Bharatha. Her name is Shri. She has come from abroad. In her childhood... Lady, don't you see the camera placed there? Shoo your animal away fast! Take 2, Ready... Her name is Shri. She has come from abroad. In her childhood.. Lady... Cover the camera with your basket! Lady, move quickly, can't you see the camera, I'm covering the news here. Her name is Shri. Poor thing, she doesn't know who her parents are. Lots of people have arrived here Smitha. Among all these people, to find who her real parents are... Is causing a head ache! The minute I find out, I will call you. This is the cameraman cum reporter Tony TV Right! Daughter... I'm your real father! On these very same shoulders you played and grew up dear! The calf will come towards the cow, is the reason why I was quiet... Come daughter, come child, it is I, I am your mother! Who is the poet who wrote The drama of this world... Who is the poet who wrote The drama of this world... With life attached emotions... With grief attached to happiness! With grief attached to happiness! Just shut up! Bharatha please send them away, I'm really getting irritated. I'm not ready to get cheated again. We are amateur actors, you saw through us easily These are theatre artists, impossible to see through! Look here, just check if our blood group matches, I have got the blood sample. So you have come fully prepared? Sir... It's not the blood that needs to match, it's the heart. You please make them go! You please make them go! Did you see Shri, you came looking for one set of parents and now you found hundreds of them. I think that's why you are glowing so much! Mother, mother, mother, mother! All this while you were calling her daughter, daughter and now its mother, I believe! Go and stand there! Come here... There are snacks and sweets ready for all. It's a buffet system. Enjoy! Is there alcohol? Yes, there is that too! Just eat the snacks that are ready and just go home! She came from abroad looking for her parents but what Shri found was hundreds of guardians! Shri is now confused and bankrupt! I don't think I'll ever find my family Bharatha. I'll go back! Sorry Shri, If you wait for a few more days, we could have searched for them. Leave it... It's all my fate! You wanted to say something! Saying so, you brought me here... What is it? I don't know how you will feel about it, but I will give you my opinion. Yesterday, so many came claiming to be your parents. What did you feel when you saw them. What do you think I'll feel? Obviously, they are frauds! There come to play on a child's emotions for her parents. I really feel bad! The kind of people in this world. They are not frauds Shri... They are helpless. Without any means! They have come to you looking for your help, that's all. But in your eyes they look like frauds. In our country no one cares for the elderly Shri... The maximum that they do is that in the city bus or the Metro they will give up their seats, that's it. Abroad when the children come of age the children leave their parents, but in our country they leave their parents after they become old. If this is the plight in the cities what do you think happens in the villages. Once they get old, since there is no to take care of them God knows how so many have died a lonely death! If you make up your mind, you can be a guardian for all of them. What Baahubali said might sound funny but think about it seriously? You came looking for your parents but what you found was hundreds of guardians! If you make up your mind, you can show them a daughter's love! All that they are expecting from you, are shelter and hope, that's all! You are right Bharatha, I didn't think about it from that angle. From today, I will stop searching for my parents, I will treat all those who came there as my own parents. I want all their love. I will really do what I can. Whatever their needs are, I will arrange for it. After I am gone, the responsibility to look after them well will be yours and Baahubali's! And one more thing, for their maintenance every month money will keep getting deposited in your account. But no cheating this time, all right? When will you be back Shri? For your wedding. Wedding! Why are you laughing? I'm serious! No more responsibility of looking for my parents from now, start looking for a girlfriend. I already have found one. Really? I want to see the picture, show me! There is no photo, she is in my heart. It's one way man. Come on Bharatha, you have managed to find fake parents for me and convinced me, is it difficult for you to convince a girl? Come on, talk to her... I want to speak to her... Call her... One second. Hello! Hi! Shri here.. Hi Shri, this is Peter... Peter? Peter? Peter I thought you have gone, you are here! That's why you were always with my girlfriend, right? I will kill you! Stand straight first and then you can kill me! What's your problem? You are my problem, she used to love me a lot, but you guys... You made her dumb! Please don't take her away! I will die without her! Leave her, please... She's mine! Leave her, She's mine! Please leave her, Leave her, You have come, couldn't you have come a little earlier? After I built my dreams, to destroy them, you bugger! Letting go is not something new to us. Who am I to let go of her. See Peter, Indians know only to give, they know only to give! They don't know to snatch. Peter, where are you? I am very sorry Shri, I didn't understand your feelings... And I know I hurt you very bad! I'm so sorry! Leave all that, where are you Peter? Turn around! Peter? Hi, Oh! My God! I love you... I love you too! In my eyes, in my eyes... I loved you when I set my eyes on you... In my heart, in my heart... I worshipped you, from far... Peter... This is what an Indian's emotions is all about, it's all in the heart! Yes, even I want to be an Indian... Look here... OK! Lord Hanuman... Are you serious? Lord Ganesha! India is great! I love you baby... Mother, you are not... Why then do you shower this love? Related, we are not... Why then do you shower this compassion? Shri... She is not our daughter. Still, she is looking after us better than our own daughter! Hoping for shelter, we lied and came here! Sir, she is well aware that none among you here are her parents. We are also among those who tried to cheat her, but she brought about a change in us too. The same change is seen in you too. What is greater than remorse, tell me? If you leave now, she will get hurt her very badly. If you are keen on hurting her feelings then you can leave. Come, let's stay here, come! Seven births too will fall short... To repay these deeds of yours! You are the Goddess Mother! This was the picture taken at the fair. If we show her this and tell her she's our daughter, she will believe us, but why are you not letting me do that? Don't we have everything we need here? She doesn't know who her real parents are, so she considers everyone here as her parents and is looking after everyone with love. If she gets to know who they are, in her heart, selfishness that is in his nature will be born! All the love she has will die and basic humanity will diminish this facility that provides shelter to many will close down. She will definitely take us home with her, that's fine... But what about the people here? All here will again be homeless! We couldn't give anything back to society but our daughter is doing a good work. Due to our selfishness let it not get spoiled! After we lost her... All that pain and suffering we have endured in our heart and we have survived for so many days, right? Even if we had not found her, we would have still survived, right? Let's continue to live like that! Whatever be our race or religion The same emotion you exhibit... It can only be you, Mother India! It was cold this morning right? It is so nice! Hi, good morning! There's a surprise for all of you today! Surprise? What is it? What is it? For breakfast with you today, do you know who is coming? Who? Who? Shri is coming... Where? Where? Where? Where? Connect it dude... Hi mom, hi dad! Hi! Hi! My daughter... Fine How are you all? Fine! Fine! Fine! Hi Bharatha... Hi Shri... What's for breakfast today? Hi ma'am, good morning. Today's breakfast menu is Idli, Vada, Bisbelebath, Chow chow bath, Wow! Pakoda, Masala Vada, Lemon Rice, Jeera Rice, Akki Roti, Pongal, Neer Dosa, Uthappa! Okay enough, that's it! I miss Indian food so much! For the amount of food you are giving everyone is put on a little weight. So when are you coming back Shri? I am coming soon, very soon. Look after your health well, all of you take your medicines on time! Take care... OK? Bye! Bye! Bye ma'am! Words are not needed, If silence is not understood... Love does not dies, If the heart does not break! Even after seven births My love will not die... It's you, who are my eternal consort! Even if you are lost to me a hundred times, Again and again, I will keep waiting! You are my eternal lady love!
