MIQUETTE "To gain Chim?ne, and for your service, what command can be issued to me that mine arm cannot accomplish? Yet, though absent from her dear eyes, I must suffer grief, sire, I have too much happiness in being able to hope! Hope in thy manly resolution; hope in my promise, and already possessing the heart of thy mistress, to overcome a scrupulous feeling of honour which is contending against thee, let time, thy valour, and thy king exert themselves. " Did you enjoy it, Mrs Grandier? I find this play revoltingly immoral. This man kills the father and marries the daughter... The king doesn't do anything about it except whine. He was like a president. He has his faults. I shouldn't have brought her. - Mum! - Did you have fun? Yes, I couldn't stop crying. Get home safely, Mrs Grandier. Goodbye madam, goodbye sir. Please, just be quiet. It's nice to be home. When you think some people go to bed so late every night! I'm exhausted. - It was just this once. - Twice! I've taken you to the theatre twice in 18 months. You made me waste money, really. I love the theatre, I wish I could go every night. Actresses are so lucky! You're crazy. Think about the awful life they lead. They're bohemians. All these women do is paint their faces and waste money. I don't mind, some are very pretty. Look at this one. And this one with her little bow! - They're beautiful. - These portraits of actresses! It's debauchery taking over the countryside. When I think that only yesterday, the vet asked me if we had any new pretty girls. It's shameful! Just shameful! Women spending 30 francs on a hat! I'd like that. Miquette, look at me for a minute. - I'm worried about you. - About me? Your eyes are very clear. Are you hiding something? What then? I don't know... maybe you're in love with a man? You wouldn't want me to be in love. - It's not a crime. - Isn't it? Then it's not worth it. I want you to be happy, honey. I'm happy, Mum. We get along just fine. I only care about you. - And about Juliette. - You're too old for this. I know it's silly but I'm just a kid. It's your fault, you're too young. You're crazy, my darling. My life is over, my life as a woman is over. Well, some people would disagree. Do you know what Mr Boisvin said the other day? No, what did he say? He said: "Holy Moses! Mrs Grandier is still very luscious!" Don't be silly! And then he added... No, I can't tell you, it wouldn't be proper. We're alone, just tell me. Then he said: "I'd really like to see her between my sheets!" That's awful! I forbid you to listen to such things. I find it rather flattering. It's too late, honey. I've never been interested anyway. I got married very young, you were born and then I became a widow. I had to remove my mirrored wardrobe to fit in your little bed. We put it back when you were old enough to have your own room. I looked into the mirror and couldn't recognise myself. My youth was gone. Your youth is just neatly folded in a drawer and it hasn't changed a bit. We'll all be in awe when you take it out. You're crazy. I would have loved to have had money, of course, to have worn dresses with a bit of lace... or even with a lot of it. To have served tea, complained about having headaches, spoken some English... Go to bed, Miquette. It's late. I'm in bed, Mum. I'm asleep. Liar! The theatre can make a girl dream. - Mrs Grandier? - What? "Holy Moses! You're still very luscious!" DAWN COMES WITH ITS ROSY FINGERS, AND IT'S TIME FOR SOME RESTORATIVE PORRIDGE. I hope your comedy was funny. No, it was no fun at all. What we saw last year was good. How can you say that, Mum? Comedies are ridiculous. - Drink it while it's hot. - Right... I only like tragedies. It was so beautiful last night: "Le Cid". "A three-act play by Mr Pierre Corneille of the Acad?mie Fran?aise and adapted by Monchablon from the theatres of Paris. " Here we go. They are talented, those two. Come on Miquette, we have customers. Right. - Some tobacco, please. - Certainly, sir. I can see you have the programme from yesterday's performance. - Yes, sir. - Were you there? I was, sir. Dear child, happy child... - Why? - You saw me perform in "Le Cid". - Were you in it? - Of course! I'm Monchablon, the star of many a play. Really? Were you playing Rodrigo? I sure was! It is he, as he stands in this repugnant shop. Excuse me? Don't worry, madam. I understand that you're moved by my presence here. It's natural of course, brace yourself. What a scary man! Playing "Le Cid" isn't my job, I do it out of consideration for my dear colleague. - Corneille? - Precisely. He's a charming man, but we never see him around. I excel mostly in parts from the classical repertoire. The hunchback, the rag-man of Paris and the bloody nun. "Revenge and I are like brothers and I'm the oldest. If you don't go to Lagard?re, Lagard?re will come to you. " Miss, the strong impression I've had on you reveals the artist in you. - Here is 20 cents. - Thank you, sir. If you ever need my advice, I'll be back in Paris tonight. You'll find me before every meal at the Caf? du Globe. I'm always surrounded by respectful comrades. I bid you farewell and exit through the door. Smoke! Your Rodrigo is a nutcase. That's the theatre for you! It's wonderful. Just last night, this old man pretended to be a legendary hero. And I believed him! It's just like a dream. Well you can't be dreaming in a shop. Give her some money. You have to go to the post office, we've run out of stamps. Who cares about stamps! Here's a customer. - Hello, Miss Poche. - Hello. You're out early, Miss Poche. You don't say, Mrs Perrine. I barely have time to get her dress ready. Could you give me about one metre of white ribbon? You're already having your confirmation! I know, Mrs Grandier. I want her to be the cutest. I've heard it'll be a beautiful ceremony. Well, well, well. Here comes the Count. - Mr Urbain is nice. - That's none of your business. He's nice but rather simple. One could even say he's a bit stupid. - Nothing like his uncle. - Nothing at all. The Marquis is quite someone. He was so elegant the other day during the procession. He has one funny habit though. He whistles the hymns instead of singing them. I'm coming! We can't catch our breath here. It's always busy on Saturdays. Hello Count, what can I do for you today? Nothing, that was all. Thank you very much. - How much do I owe you? - Well, nothing. That's too bad, I'll come back then. - Do you need anything? - Do I? No, I don't need anything. I hope Miss Miquette isn't ill. She's fine, she just went out. She went out! That's why she isn't here. Excuse me, Count, but you didn't tell me what you wanted. Of course, of course... Well then, good day, Mrs Grandier. Give me some tobacco. - As usual. - Right, as usual. - You smoke too much. - I never smoke. Thank you very much, thank you. - Thank you. - There you go, Count. I almost forgot your umbrella! Don't worry, I have it right here. I'd be surprised, you forgot it here yesterday. I've lost it then! No, it's right here. What a relief because if it were to rain, since I forgot my cane... But it won't rain. Oh! Mr Urbain, I'm sorry. You're soaked! Do you think? It's because I forgot my umbrella. - It's here, on your arm. - Right, I forgot to open it. Come take shelter. Isn't that better? Did you catch a cold? Not today. I caught it last Saturday on my way back from Paris. I was in a carriage and the window was broken so there was a draught. You should have exchanged seats with someone. I couldn't because there was no one else in the carriage. Yes, alright... I understand. It's raining more and more. - Lovely weather! - It's good for the earth. - It's good for the trees. - It's good for the leaves. But it's not good for fruits. Yes, we'll have no fruits. That's all for the best. - Lovely weather! - Let's hope it lasts. THE DAY AFTER, AS THE VESPERS BELL WAS RINGING... I could mind the shop, if you like. No, Mum. Go show your friends how pretty you are. You'll tell me how His Grace was. I've heard he's going around in a car. That's progress. I've heard people say his skin is like a goat's. That's another of the teacher's nasty comments. Our bishop is so handsome and he smokes! He's a saint! Where I'm from in Brittany, saints don't drive cars. Unless there's a miracle of course. Don't be smart. When I think I gave her my milk! Don't say that Perrine, please. It's disgusting, a woman your age shouldn't talk about her milk. You little rascal. - Bye, dear. And don't forget them. - Forget who? The sweetbreads! Take them out of the oven in 45 minutes. It's all I'll think about. You scared me, Count. How did you get in? I came through the garden, it's less crowded. I have to tell you things which are rather... serious. Oh dear God! - Very serious. - Really? - I wanted... - Yes? I wanted some matches. - A box of matches. - We've run out of matches. Then give me some tobacco, it'll be just as good. Very well. There you go! You don't even smoke. Precisely, that's why I don't need matches. If you had had tobacco and... Goodbye, miss. I hope your children are alright. Mrs Grandier! I've got some news. Do you know what the baker told me? What then? I usually never meddle in other people's business. But this time... It's just small talk really. Don't listen, it's not for little girls. Every Sunday, the Marquis orders six little pastries for the following Thursday. - Everyone knows. - Well he didn't order them today. No way! Do you know what he ordered instead? One big cake! - What? - A cake for ten! - No! - I'm telling you. - A big cake? - And you don't know the best yet. - A cake with fancy icing! - With icing? He also ordered quenelles. They will go bankrupt, I'm telling you. Try to guess what he asked for on top of that. Truffles! There must be something going on. Who could be having dinner with the La Tour-Mirande on Thursday? Mr and Mrs Mercadier, the rich refiners, and their eldest daughter, Marie-Th?r?se. She's a slightly ungraceful angel. She'll sit right next to Urbain. My dear cousin, I'm keeping an eye on you! This is my last warning, leave your foot on the floor. 56 for my lord. Urbain will be quiet during dinner, he'll choke on his turkey. 57! He'll spill his wine and mop it up with the girl's dress. All that won't keep him from becoming engaged by dessert. Everyone will be happy and he'll be surprised. 58. What if Urbain refuses? Urbain has absolutely no willpower. He's a simple soul, Marquis. He's an idiot, that's what he is. 59. I'm telling you, Priest, our rank no longer is what it used to be. If you'd only known me when I was 20, I was so bright. I was bright and corrupt. Hortense Schneider's cleavage, C?leste Mogador's beauty spot. Do you realise what you gave up? Oh well... I'd have loved to have seen Urbain in my place facing Mac Mahon. You fought the Marshall, really? I beat him at croquet, right in front of the Empress' eyes. I almost destroyed his career. 60. - You won't make this one. - Really? - Yes. - Why not? You'll see. I saw you! Right, you saw me but it's my turn to play. My lord, it's almost time for the ceremony. Your parishioners can wait, it's my turn to play. Give me the cue, I'll score three in one go. - Three. - Three. - This is quite moving. - Don't try to distract me. Nice work. Father Combes is right! Goddamn clergy! What is this? JOURNAL I don't love you and I don't love you either. The one I love doesn't look as smart but he's more faithful. - It's you again. - Yes. - I found the way! - The way to do what? The way to... I need to send a postcard right away. A card with an illustration on it. - Take a look at our collection. - Yes. - Which one would you like? - One that you like. This is a beautiful picture of your ch?teau. We can even see your uncle, the Marquis, at the window. No! I don't want him to see what I write. - I'm not crazy! - Then I don't know... - Pick what you want. - This one. The bunch of daisies is beautiful. It is. - It's original, isn't it? - Yes. - There isn't much space to write. - That's okay. It's very short, no more than four or five words. You'll only need a one penny stamp. With the new regulations, you're allowed five words for salutations. That's great, I'm happy. Are you writing a salutation, Mr Urbain? It's some kind of salutation, you can read it if you want. "Miss, I love you very much. " I can't believe this! Who are you writing this to? A woman? I'm sure it's a woman! And you call that a "salutation"! But a declaration of love is nothing like a salutation. The administration says so! - But... - It'll be two pennies. Write what you will but you should have told me before I made a mistake like that. - It's just untactful! - What? But I'll be calm, just see for yourself! I'll mail it myself, your stupid card! Wait, wait! These daisies look ridiculous, how can anyone buy this? Wait! There's no address. Because you need an address too? That's the last straw! There! But you don't understand... I thought that maybe you... Wait a minute, don't get annoyed. "To Miss... " Are you done yet? Yes, I'm done. Here's the address. "Miss... Miquette Grandier. " I'm Miquette Grandier. Well... I think I am. I believe so too. So, it's me that... Yes. Oh, dear God! Miquette? Miquette. I know, I was scared to tell you. I look eager and confident but deep down inside... I'm not really like that. Miquette... Miquette, don't cry like this. - Are you upset about what I said? - No! Come on, Miquette! Miquette! Miquette, why are you crying then? Because I'm so happy! Right... People don't cry when they're happy, it's absurd. It's because I'm so happy. There's one thing you don't know. What then? I love you too. Oh dear God! Mr Urbain, why are you crying like this? It's only because... I'm just so happy! It's alright, I'm done. I'm done too. Do you really love me? - Very much. - Very much... That's what you wrote on the card, "very much". Daisies are so beautiful. You have good taste. I don't know about that. Since it was for me, a one penny stamp would have been enough. Never mind that, money doesn't matter in times like these. How long have you loved me? Since the first time I saw you. It happened just like that. And then? Then I rushed home to the ch?teau, I took a notebook that I had left from school, and I wrote on it "My life's journal, secret document". - What's in it? - You! - It's compromising. - Don't worry. The manuscript is hidden in my heart and no one knows about it. Good, if your uncle found out... He's a terrible man. Terrible but admirable. Did you ever tell him how you felt about me? No... well, yes. I started telling him once. - Really? - I didn't name you. What did he say? - His answer was rather vague. - What was it? He said: "Get lost, you idiot". - It's quite vague indeed. - Yes. It's very vague, actually. What if he were to separate us? I'm a new man now that you love me. If my uncle were to come between us, I'd confront him. I'd tell him: "I'm a man!" - "I'm no kid anymore!" - Urbain! Urbain! Urbain, my boy, you'll do me the pleasure of taking your hat, your umbrella... You'll get out, take the second street on the right, then the third on the left, you'll go along road 33. That'll lead you to my beautiful Ch?teau de la Tour-Mirande. You'll go in, go upstairs to your room and keep writing in... your "life's journal". Do you know about it, Marquis? I found it in my living room an hour ago. You said it was hidden! He hid it in my living room. It's a stupid hiding place. It's silly and full of spelling mistakes too. - Uncle... - Just go! Yes, Uncle. Thank you. How are you? He did resist a bit... Not much though. She's lovely, simply lovely. Poor girl... Oh well! Listen to me carefully, Miss Grandier. I've known the Grand Empire. Through my exceptional career, I've gained common sense, and stunning willpower. Thus you'll not be surprised if I tell you that I saw through your game right away, you wily girl. Me? You thought that Urbain was a gullible idiot, that you could get him to court you with a sigh and a kiss, and there you go, Countess de la Tour-Mirande! That's an awful thing to say! I don't care about being a countess. What am I supposed to think then? If you didn't want to marry him, did you expect to become the boy's mistress? His mistress? Are you crazy? I'm a good girl, sir. So what do you want from Urbain? Just to love him. You only have two hands, the right and the left. Which one do you want to give him? I don't know. Both? That was well said. Is she naive or is it one of her tricks? Pardon me, my sweet child... The sweetbreads! Good heavens! - What's going on? - Just look! I shouldn't have listened to you. What do I care if you've known the First Empire? The Second Empire, dear. Who cares! My sweetbreads are all burnt now! Don't be mad, dear. I understood you right away. You're a housewife, an honest country girl. A family girl, your cheeks aren't made for blushing. What could make me blush? The truth! Urbain's engagement dinner is on Thursday. What? It can't be true. Tell me it's not true. Urbain will marry Miss Mercadier. Her nose is crooked. He'll look at her best profile, a profile worth three million! It's a dowry, or a compensation if you will. No, it can't be true. He was here earlier, he told me he loved me. He didn't seem to know. - Of course... - It's so mean. Don't cry like this, you'll hurt your eyes and your complexion. Such a beautiful complexion! She really is a cute girl, I can't believe how cute she is! - Dear Miquette... - I want to die! I'll jump out of the window, then I'll swallow a bottle of poison. He'll be sorry and regret it his whole life. You won't enjoy it if you're dead. There must be another way to take revenge. Do you think? Something that'll make him suffer and cry? Wait! I might have an idea, a remote idea... - Tell me. - One minute. The idea is getting closer, it's coming now... It's here! That's wonderful! I'll love you for it. I'm holding it now. THE MARQUIS IS AN OLD DEVIL My dear, I understood you right away. Again? You're an elegant Parisian, a purebred filly made for a life of money, luxury, jewels, and restaurants with music. Listen to the music. Do you know what the music is telling you? It's telling you to do like it, to open your wings. You have to get people to talk about you. - You must be elegant and renowned. - A great actress! - Do you like the theatre? - I love it! - Can you act? - Yes! Then think no more and come with me! You'll start in a month and in three, your name will be famous throughout the world. - Do you think? - For sure! Look, even the local paper knows about it! "Our fellow citizen, Miquette Grandier, the rising star. " - The little Miquette? - The Great Miquette! "Ten admirers ask for her hand. " "The Persian Shah sent her a trunk full of diamonds. " "She wears a new hat every day, a 30 franc hat!" - He won't believe it. - Who? Him! When he reads this by the fire with his ugly Mercadier. Count Urbain, if only you'd known! - But this is just a dream. - Why? - How could I do this? - I know someone. A man! He's very chic and handsome. He might not be so young anymore but he isn't old just yet. Who's that? - Me. - You? I can make you the Queen of Paris. Would I have to go to Paris? Of course! The sooner the better. You'll settle in my hotel, Rue de la Bienfaisance. I'll meet you there. The last train leaves at 7:28 pm and my servant fought in the Italian Campaign so don't you try to argue. You do have stunning willpower! I'm stunned myself. This is for your journey. Who do you think I am? I've got my piggy bank. A piggy bank! Isn't she cute? My poor piggy bank... It was so easy to break. I'd never seen someone break a piggy bank. It's really heart-breaking. Would you have some change to spare? - Here you go. - Thank you, sir. Two gold coins! I can't believe it! Go get your bag now. Yes, I have to hurry. I'd like a cigar. - This gentleman will serve you. - But... - Please? - My pleasure! They're Coronas. - But... - Help yourself. - How much do I owe you? - Nothing at all. Thanks mate! I'll come back. What a weird cigar store. What a weird blind man. It's hard to leave on my own. Dear Juliette! Congratulations Aldebert! Your nephew is back on the right track and you're on the wrong one. That's what we call being a good father. - I'm ready. - She has a doll! I really like this girl. Let's get going, my child. - Through the back door? - Of course, it's a kidnapping! It really is like a kidnapping, it's so funny! It's not dangerous with you, you're like a father to me. Isn't she naive? You're the loyal type, aren't you? Exactly, I'm loyal, bright and corrupt. Hear ye, hear ye! We've found a big notebook on the road with handwritten entries, called: "My life's journal, secret document. " HELLO PARIS, INFAMOUS AND WONDERFUL CITY! Hello Pierre, is the Marquis home? He arrived 20 minutes ago. Hello Mr Lahirel. The Marquis is expecting you in his salon. He was really impatient. - We're really worried. - Is he ill? If only! - He shaved his goatee! - His goatee? Yes, sir. We've had a lady in the house since yesterday. A new one! Is Aldebert cheating on Hermance? If only! Try to guess who this lady is sleeping with. - Her cousin? - If only! - A child! - Is it the Marquis'? - Whose could it be? - Who knows! It's unbelievable! Aldebert is getting old! You must be mistaken. I'm not, I saw it with my own eyes. - How? - Through the keyhole! That's wrong, Pierre. I'd never have thought that of you. Juliette, you're in Paris, capital of France. It's home to the Eiffel Tower and Mr Loubet. We'll become famous, my dear, but we have to behave. Actually, it'll be faster if we misbehave. She's playing with a doll. Aldebert is crazy, I'll talk to him. Come on in. - Listen... - Quiet and take off your hat! Close the door and look at me. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four... Do you find me changed? - No. - Idiot! I've lost 30 years in a cigar store. You'll get them back, don't worry. Don't mock me! I'm in love, I'm athletic. I find everything beautiful, even you! Thanks for being so nice! No! You'll have to do a bad deed for me. Quiet! There's a very big cheque by the sink. I want you to take it and break up with Hermance for me. - Me? - You! Of course, it will be hard on her. After three faithful and loving years. You break it off like that after she brought you so much sorrow. You're really not nice, Aldebert. What can I say? Since I got my youth back, my heart belongs to only one woman now. Send someone else to stop Hermance's tears with your cheque. - I can't do it. - Why not? I've been seeing her for six months. - No... - Yes! In that case, you'll be the one giving her a cheque. Hurry up, go dry her tears. - This man has such willpower. - Go! I'm still cheated on at 65... Everything's fine. ALDEBERT PUSHES HIS LUCK I wanted to talk to you because one thing is certain: - We need to talk. - Of course. Are you alright? I'm sure you're aware that I have feelings for you... that are rather special. And I'm talking about feelings of... Friendship! Thank you. Yes, friendship but I mean feelings of... - Affection! - Thank you, yes. Yes, affection, but what I mean by that is... - You understand. - Sorry, I didn't hear. - Let's be serious, Miquette. - At my age? You do understand what not talking means, don't you? What? Who's the knight staring at me? He's our ancestor. Our ancestor Hugue Aldebert, first of his kin. He's elegant! - You look like him. - Thank you, but... And this one? An ancestor who, in an heroic charge, won the battle of Malplaquet. - But... - It's funny! - And this little boy? - Don't worry about this. - I'm interested. - You know, all these things... - Don't you know? - Of course I know. - I'll show you that I know. - Are you calling someone? Remind me of the name of the boy. Hugues Aldebert Christian, Marquis de la Tour-Mirande, Marshall of France, died at Fontenoy at 23 years old. Very well. Your servant knows more than you. My child, we are the history, we don't need to know it. Where was I? You told me that you loved me like a father. I love you like a father. What are you making me say? That's what I understood. Leave the doll alone and come sit down. Yes, Marquis. Miquette, you're a woman who can't live without love. - Marquis! - Are you shocked? I'm no prude but remember that Juliette is here. The things that you hear, poor Juliette. What do you think? - She isn't objecting! - Wait a minute. What would you tell the man if you were me? Daddy! Daddy? Juliette is annoying me. She's annoying! Are you upset? No. She was just joking. She didn't realise that you're a man who drove women crazy, and who might still do! She's sorry. Kiss her to show you forgive her. Come on, Miquette. You disrespect the mother by not kissing the daughter. Alright... Isn't she nice? Isn't she cute? "Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetop, When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. " I'll suspend you for that! Just get lost! I'm sorry sir, Mr Urbain just arrived with his car. - Urbain, here? - I'm begging you! Don't let him in, I won't see him. Don't worry, you won't. Just go that way. He never opens his mouth anyway. It'll be quick. Well, here you are! - I told you to... - Please, Marquis! One cannot recklessly be evil and depraved. The darkest schemes will be revealed. What's with you? This has been proven in the past! You're crazy! I'm in a hurry, I'm expecting guests. - I only need a couple of hours. - God! Ravaillac was quartered and his ashes scattered in the wind. Why would I care? - Judas had a terrible death! - So what? - And Louis XI... - What about him? He died in an iron cage. - Are you sure? - I'm certain. That might very well be... So what? Don't you understand? I've found out about your scheme, Judas! I've seen through your giant cakes, Ravaillac! It wasn't enough for you to promise me to Miss Mercadier. You got rid of Miquette too because she was in the way. Me? You've completely lost your mind. No, Uncle. I'm telling it to your face: I won't let you stamp on the daisies any longer. What daisies? Is he nuts? - What do you want? - I want Miquette, where is she? - I don't know. - Alright. - I'll break everything. - What? - What are you doing? - Do you see this bisque ornament? You're completely drunk! - Let go of it! - Sure! You'll see! Now, you'll tell me where Miquette is. Look at my porcelain tea set! That's all that's left! I'll destroy the whole house until I find her. - Give me the bowl. - Never! - Give me the sugar bowl! - Stop, never! Very well. Where is Miquette? I'll cut you out of my will, do you hear me? I heard. My great-aunt, Ad?la?de! Don't touch her, sacrilege! She slept with Louis XIV! Too bad for her... I'll count to three. One. - Two. - Listen! I swear that your Miquette isn't here. Is this true? I swear on your poor mother's life. Alright. Dear Ad?la?de. Miquette! My aunt! Stop breaking your beautiful things, Marquis. Please calm down. This man isn't worth it. - Me? - Congratulations, sir. Aren't you ashamed of troubling your uncle? My head! I must be dreaming. I'm sure I'm dreaming, there's no way... Are you the one defending that monster? - This monster kidnapped you! - He's crazy. Completely crazy! He belongs in a hospital. - But Miquette... - Miss Grandier! Miss, Mr... Whatever you like. Explain yourself. Are you going to tell me that you decided to come here? I mean... - He must have forced you. - Mr Urbain, I do whatever I want. I don't owe a bloke like you any explanation. A bloke? Yes, a bloke. Do you understand? No. I'm not surprised. The Marquis understood me. Right away! I'm an elegant Parisian. I'm a great actress made for luxury and jewels. But yesterday... Yesterday, I was acting, dear sir. I made a fool of you and I'm happy! So when you said you loved me... I was lying to you, yes sir! Me too, miss! - Not as much as I, sir! - A lot more than you, miss! I don't believe you. You're not capable of it, you baby! Baby? I can't believe it! When I think I almost ruined my marriage for a liar like you. - And your three million. - What three million? You don't buy Count Urbain, he's for free. Miss Mercadier is a proper young woman. - She has a moustache. - Only a little fuzz! I like her little fuzz, I respect it. - I'll marry her tonight. - What are you waiting for? You shouldn't lose any time, run back to her! - You seem to be happy about it. - I'm delighted! - I bask in bliss. - And I even sing! I can sing too! I even dance, I'll dance while leaving! - Did you hurt yourself? - No, miss. My heart is broken but another one will fix it. ADIEU, POOR URBAIN! NOW LET'S HOPE THAT MONCHABLON IS AT THE CAFE DU GLOBE HE'S THERE... BUT Here's the paper! I've sung at the Trianon, sir! Here's the paper! Find out about Bismarck's death! "I'm sorry if I'm causing you sorrow. I want to become a great actress. I'm sure Mr Monchablon will help me. Don't cry. I'll make a lot of money and you'll come visit me. Your Miquette. " I found this in her room. She has good intentions, a noble heart and good confidence. Unfortunately, she missed her entrance. - Sorry? - She hasn't arrived yet. Dear God! What could have happened to her? - She's not a kid anymore. - Shut up, No?mie. Have respect for a mother's tears. The poor child was right in a way. A true artist doesn't come on stage without any preparation. After the desperate mother's tears, the situation is different. The atmosphere is set. - Do you think she'll come? - She'll be here soon. The audience is ready. Dear God, who knows where she is right now? "On the road from Tyre to Babylon. " - Excuse me? - "Godfrey of Bouillon". Act 3, scene 5. I'm really sorry, I'm just very upset. It's hard on a mother's heart to go on a train after her daughter. - Good line! - Very natural. Shut up, No?mie. I'll use it in my next tragedy. - If you don't mind, of course. - If it makes you happy. You'll achieve posterity, quite simply. You're very kind, sir. Let me know when you hear from her. I'll be staying at the Good Herdsman Hotel. Do you know the Good Herdsman? - The Good Herdsman? - It's behind Saint-Sulpice. The priest told me it was safe. God bless you. As soon as your daughter is safe with me, I'll send you a messenger, our very own little Hermes: our dear friend, Panouillard. Thank you. - Goodbye, madam. - Goodbye, madam. I'll light a candle at Saint Antony. - It can't hurt. - This woman has some curves! What a strange place. Anyway. To go back to the part of the little Baroness... Please, don't start again with this. I wouldn't say no to other parts. But never to the little Baroness! It's a 30 penny difference, we could work it out. You don't negotiate with art! Here she comes, she isn't alone. Try to be discreet. I'll fine the first one who mentions the mother. Excuse me, sir. You probably don't recognise me. You're the cigar store girl! You're called Miquette, right? You came to Paris to start off as an actress. That's impressive. "All great artists are also prophets. " "The Wandering Jew's Daughter", act 2, scene 3. You have a good physique, you're fit and have a decorative friend. That's what talent is about. Let me introduce you. Mr Monchablon, this is Mr de la Tour-Mirande. Marquis de la Tour-Mirande. A Marquis! My pleasure. Gar?on! A grenadine for the lady and a strong absinthe for the Marquis. Please, it's my treat! What's your register? It's tragedy, sir, drama. Have you acted before? Yes, at school. - Which part? - The old Horace. - If you see something for me... - Maybe. I'm planning a tour at the moment. - A family show, really. - Shut up, No?mie. We'll perform "The Lady from Maxim's" and one original play. Our comrade here plays the part of Crevette, she's perfect. Slightly sad but perfect. In the original play, the part of the little Baroness is available. - But I... - No?mie, shut up! The little Baroness is available? If you could do it... - I could, I could! - We could! We could! Who's the author? Me, only me. Corneille didn't help this time. Thank God! He has some good qualities. My play is a tragedy in a salon. I used my own experience of upper-class society. - What's it called? - "In the World". - Pardon? - "In the World". What happens in it? There are three characters: husband, wife and lover. - That's original! - Someone had to think of it. The Baron is the husband, written for you Labrissi?re. Fight for him, he deserves it. He's from the upper class: nice clothes, cuff-links... - Fancy buttons... - Yes. He's part of the most influential spheres and private clubs. God! The little Baroness... Shut up No?mie! She's really prim and proper, she's a tough woman. She does offer herself but not to just anyone. You have to be introduced first. The knight will be played by the manly Saint-Giron and he's the lover. A Breton gentleman who is touchy about honour. When the play starts, I go to my mistress to borrow 3,000 francs. It's beautiful! A few days before, as the Baron was coming back from hunting, he found the knight in his wife's bed, the Baroness. He's had doubts ever since. That's our start. Then it goes on and on for ten scenes. You can feel the experience. It's admirable. Admirable is a strong word but it's the right one. You have to understand that I need to see you act before giving you such a part, honey. Honey? He called me honey, how nice! Do you know a part? I know "Le Cid". Very well, I will hear you tomorrow morning. You should come have a drink at my place. 8 rue de la Bienfaisance? That's a fancy neighbourhood. I picked this street to do good deeds. I'll do you the honour of coming at dawn. Gar?on! The dressmaker is expecting us, dear. - Keep the change. - Thank you, sir. Bravo! What about the 7.25 francs from this morning? I'm sorry. - Keep the change. - See you tomorrow then. - Ladies, gentlemen. - Marquis! "If all aristocrats were like you, there would have been no revolution. " "The Children of the Scaffold". - Where are you going? - Her mother! - What? - We can't let her worry! - You pig! - Shut up, No?mie. "My soul has its secret, my life its mystery. " Victor Hugo. Victor Hugo! Sir? Mr Monchablon, from the theatres of Paris. Let them know I'm here, they're expecting me for a drink. What a nice decor! - The monastery's chapel. - I'll see if the Marquis is here. Yes, please do, please do. Spartacus! Mr Monchablon. - Mr Monchablon! - One minute. I'll ring when we're ready. You must be delighted, young lady. It's madness! It's too nice for me, I can't afford dresses like that. Let me buy it for you. No Marquis, I warned you. I won't accept anything from you. I'll buy what I can. Very well. How much can you afford then? I don't know... Not more than 100 francs. 100 francs? You must be dreaming! Ladies, such a dress isn't worth more than... What would you say? - 59.50 francs, Marquis. - See? - What about the hat? - It's always included. It's cheaper than at home! I want to order another one. You should pay us a visit and we'll show you the latest fashions. We'll do that. Goodbye ladies. - Goodbye. - I'm happy! I'm entering through the door! - I'm sorry I made you wait. - Don't apologise. I used this time to work on a part that I created for a performance in Soissons. Romeo. Romeo? My goodness! It's my job. These still-life paintings are beautiful. - Do you know your part? - We know our part. Then let's enjoy some theatre. I'm all ears. - The line! - The line. Give her the line. The line? - Excuse me if I was tactless. - Not at all! But I'm afraid it's not possible. When I act, I indulge in it completely and can't listen. I never listen to my fellow actors, that's my strength. Which scene will you act out? - Chim?ne and her servant. - You'll be the servant. I can't play the servant. I can play Chim?ne but not the servant. That's a true artist! What about the setting? Here is Don Diegue's house. The king's palace. The king. And the infante's garden. - Give me this. - That's enough! - Please, I'm begging you! - My pleasure. And here, the footlights. Voila! I'll be the audience. Make me cry, that's what I paid for. - The booklet! - The booklet. You can start. - "At last... " - Not here! You came in through the wall, go around. - Go around. - My pleasure! "At last I see myself free, and I can, without... and I can, without... I... At last I see myself free, and I can, without constraint, show thee the extent of my keen sorrows; I can give vent to my free sighs. " - Sad! - "To my sad sighs. " "I can unbosom to thee my soul and all my griefs. My father is dead, Elvira; and Rodrigo's first sword has cut his thread of life. Weep, weep, mine eyes, and dissolve yourselves into tears! The one half of my life has laid the other in the grave, and compels me to revenge, after this fatal blow, that which I have no more on that which still remains. Calm yourself, dear lady. " That's it. That's it. Strange. Very strange. Very, very strange. Remarkable! - You have a future. - Do you think? But my dear, you surely are made for comedy. Comedy? Comedy! What's with her? What did you say? - Comedy! - Why are you crying, silly girl? Do you think comedy is funny? - Are you sure? - I have no doubts. People are never wrong about these things. - You're made for tragedy. - Excuse me? There would be no better Theramenes than you! Theramenes? It's what we call "the tragic old fool". This is very unpleasant. Are you done crying? You're talented. I'm talented too. The proof is that I'm hiring you. How wonderful! My "Lady from Maxim's" is too sad, she can have the part. Would you have a Louis XVI table and a pen? - There's my desk. - That'll do. I'm writing your contract, dear. A golden opportunity! Ten francs a day. I can't believe it! You won't need me anymore. You've got me wrong, Marquis. I'll be famous! They'll sell my picture! In your old cigar store... Your nephew will buy it, he'll be mad! He'll have to say: "what a great artist! And I preferred Miss Mercadier to her... " Here's the contract. Sign here. And here. There. Come to the Caf? du Globe at 8 pm for rehearsal. Be on time or you'll be fined. Excuse me? - It's in the contract. - Don't worry, I'll be there. I really hope so. In the meantime, on my honoured favour, make yourself worthy of the gift you've received. Well, well, well! Mr Monchablon! What a nice surprise! Don't you dare close the door or I'll call the police. Dear madam... Still no word from my daughter, right? - Well, no... I mean... - Old liar! "We'll let you know right away, poor mother. We'll send you a messenger!" I have a message for you right here! My dear madam, poor, poor mother... - You kidnapper! - You're mistaken! "The Courrier de Lyon. " Shut up, old fool! No?mie lead me here. No?mie? Where's my daughter? Give her back right away! - Don't yell, I swear to you... - Shut up! Give me my daughter or I'll kill you. - Stop it, stop! - You disgusting rake! Stop it! - You'll pay for this! - Easy! Take this! Take this Rodrigo, you smooth talker! - Easy, easy! - You murderer! Murderer! - Murderer, murderer! - Help, help! - Open up! - Mum! Mum... Here you are, you naughty girl. - I'm so sorry, let me explain. - Enough! - We'll explain to you. - Enough! Mrs Grandier! Good morning. Marquis? I must be going mad. What are you doing here? This is my home. - Your home? - Yes. So you're the old man people talk about. The old man? Oh dear God, it's a disaster! What will people say back home? My daughter and I were so respectable. Our whole family was respectable. The Marquis is also respectable. You can tell right away. Tell her yourself that you're respectable. But of course, Mrs Grandier. I'm very respectable. Everyone knows the Marquis is an honourable man. He's old, not compromising at all. Look at him, he's no Adonis anymore. Tell her that you're not compromising. - It's very unpleasant. - Please? My pleasure! It's true Mrs Grandier. I'm not compromising at all. Not right now. Still, it's a disaster. What will we become? Don't worry about it, Mum. Everything's fine. I'll be famous, I already have a job. - An actress? - Yes, dear mother. Your daughter has the honour of coming on the Monchablon tour. A tour? I've had enough! Did you think I'd travel like a bohemian at my age? Are you bringing your mother? - Bring me? - Is it in the contract? Never! I can only allow you to follow her at your own cost. - I don't have the money. - Please, Mrs Grandier, I'm here. We don't take that kind of money, Marquis. Come, I'll take you home. - But Mum... - It's too late. She's signed, she's bound. You'd have to pay a 100,000-franc fine. 100,000 francs? It's a disaster! It's rather irritating. What then? I can't go. Wait! Stand up. - Sorry? - Stand up. Walk. Stop! You look perfect for the theatre. You're fit, you have a smart daughter. That's talent. - You're talented. - Me? - You? - You? I'm hiring you. Me? Going on stage? How awful! Mum, it would be wonderful! You naughty child! You'd make your mother paint her face, wear a wig and say improper things on stage? Marquis, my mother-in-law was a Pichon! Pichon? My goodness! My aunt was married to the president of Saint-Yrieix courthouse. - Did they have kids? - No. Good! The president actually ran off with the curate's servant. Mrs Grandier, that's not really respectable. You should be an actress. - And play a duchess. - A duchess? - You can't say no. - Morally, you can't. I offer you a great deal, a golden opportunity: five francs a day. Tonight's rehearsal. - We leave on Tuesday. - On Tuesday! - You too? - I go on business, where? - In Beauvais, they love me there. - Bravo! Great, it's agreed. I'll send you your script. You'll only have five lines, dear. - Is that all? - That's a true artist! And I exit through the door! Hold on a minute! Now I've decided to be a great actress and be cheered by the audience, I won't let go of you. You'll show me where to buy some rouge and make-up. After you, Duchess. With God's help, I'll try to please you. Thank you. You have no idea how grateful I am. - Really? - I swear! Prove it then! Give me a kiss and call me Aldebert. You must be joking, Marquis. I wouldn't dare. Dare! Please, dare! No, you're going too fast. Just see how close we've become after only one day. But from this to... - To what? - To... There's a step. A big step. One could even trip over. No, Marquis. The day I call you Aldebert, will be the day I'll be ready to kiss you. When will you call me Aldebert then? Who knows... Soon! In six months maybe! My goodness! I'll be ten years older in six months. SIX MONTHS LATER... "We've stopped performing the comedy and are doing instead a great tragedy in which I'm wonderful. As I exclaim "To La Rochelle!", everyone stands up. " - Everyone? - Yes, it's the end of the play. - Right. - Mrs Grandier sure isn't modest. And... - What about Miquette? - Poor Miquette. She hasn't changed a bit. She asks after the postman and her dog. Does she ask after me by any chance? I told her you were getting married in a week. - Ouch! - Did you hurt yourself? - I peeled my thumb. - My goodness. It's nothing. Who would have thought our Miquette would become a star? - I knew it. - You, of course. You should think about something else. What's done is done. It's done, yes. I never think about it, Perrine. I only talk about it when I see you. Right... Come help me. Let's put the flags on the map. It's next week's programme. - Monday in Gex. - She loves me not. - Tuesday in Nantua. - She loves me. Wednesday in Annemasse. She loves me not. Thursday in Thonon. She loves me. Friday in Saint-R?my. She loves me not... - It's not raining? - Why should it be raining? A spa town needs water! Marquis! Marquis! - I'm here. - Where's my parasol? With the rapier. - And my waterproof? - It's in the hat-box. Ladies. Labrissi?re, you'll keep an eye on the swords. Panouillard, you'll take care of the baskets. Excuse me, excuse me. Good evening, Duke. Dear Duke, I don't think we've met but let me give you one piece of selfless advice. Don't miss tonight's performance at the Sylvan theatre. "Olivier de M?dan or the Outcast's revenge". With your very own Monchablon and our rising star Miquette Grandier. Don't thank me, it's a performance no one should miss. Let me give you my card. American advertising... Hello my friend. I hoped you reserved your best rooms for us. The best ones within your price range, sir. - Is the sixth floor ready? - Yes, sir. This place looks really chic, it's very classy. - Excuse me, madam. - Isn't he cute! Please, Mrs Grandier. - The owner looks like a club-man. - Mother, please! - Do you like it, Miquette? - I like it anywhere. It doesn't look like it, you look unwell. I'm well... Actually no. Excuse me. Thank you. - How's your room, Miquette? - I don't know. "I don't know"! She'll end up with the best room, as usual. Her Aldebert does things right. Don't be pointlessly mean, ladies. You know very well she doesn't take the Marquis' money and doesn't do him any favours. Well I don't think she's any different than us. Not everyone is like you. Did you receive flowers again? - Yes. - Is it still your stranger? A man that loves you is never a stranger. I think it's the third-row cutie from Beauvais. I don't know. In every town, I get flowers and a letter signed "Pierre Marie Auguste Brion". That's all. It sounds like a vet's name. Then it could be the tall one from Moudon. There are plenty of vets there. I'm not trying to guess, I'll just wait. My poor darling, you really don't have a romantic disposition. Here comes the Marquis. Did you get my mail, Marquis? - Nothing for you. - Excuse me? I can't believe I didn't receive anything. All of your admirers have forgotten you. Stop it, you monster! I'll start to think that you're intercepting my mail. - Excuse me? - I forgive you. Miquette, darling, I'll go change. See you later. Goodbye, goodbye! I know some English now. TONIGHT, THE SYLVAN THEATRE IS CONSUMED BY WORRY... HAS MRS GRANDIER BEEN SWALLOWED UP BY THE WHIRLWIND OF PLEASURE? Mrs Grandier? Mrs Grandier? - And? - She isn't at the hotel. I'll look in the audience. "My dear child, we're reaching the end of our misfortune. Oh Father! How can you still hope to triumph over the powerful Duke? I believe in justice! I'm surprised the bandit hasn't tried to ambush me yet. Help! Help! Three men against one! The cowards! Hang on, I'm coming! Here comes my artful thrust! I'm dead! I got one!" - And Mrs Grandier? - Nowhere to be found. Damn her! - "Let's get the others. - They ran away. Sir, please allow me to be your friend. I could mention you to my uncle. Who's your uncle? Cardinal Richelieu! Before you compromise yourself, do you know who I am? - Who are you? - I'm Olivier de M?dan. The outcast? Can the dead come out of the grave? Sometimes, they can in order to seek revenge. " - Marquis? - Shush! Marquis! One minute, you're distracting me from clapping. - I'm so worried. - Not as much as I am. Well? Miquette's mum has been missing since 6 pm. My goodness! It's unbelievable, she won't have time to get ready. If she misses her entrance, I sure won't miss her! - Boss! - Is it her? No, these two gentlemen are writers from Paris. They'd like to speak with you. Are they finally going to do me justice? I'm coming. You don't look well tonight. You should get some rest. Do you like your Miquette? Do I like you? You're my pride and joy! Isn't it something? It's you! No, well yes... I mean... - You have some nerve! - I do have a nerve. Please, get out. Don't worry about me. I mean, I don't mind. What were you doing in my dressing room? Madam, I came here to complete an important mission that I've given myself and agreed to complete... Anyway. Anyway! What do you want? My uncle sent me a telegram saying he wasn't coming to my wedding because... well he said he had acute rheumatism. My fianc?e's family, who's very smart... - Your fianc?e? - No, her family. They understood that you were his rheumatism. How nice! I have to bring my uncle back. My future is at stake! The wedding will be cancelled without him. That's why I'm very emotional. Very emotional indeed. Come on in. Thank you, madam. Listen to me carefully, sir. I cannot give your uncle, his freedom back since I never took it in the first place. - Don't you believe me? - I do! - So easily? - Yes. Why? - Because I trust you. - Really? Miquette? Miquette, can I come in? No! I'm naked! Any news from your mother? None. I'll be in the audience if you need me. Thank you. Is Mrs Grandier sick? No, she's just late. That's why I'm rather emotional too. Very emotional indeed. I will not stand in the way of your plans, quite the contrary. Thank you, madam. I'm glad. You've welcomed my visit with such composure. Just like me really! Miquette, we're starting. - I'm coming! - Don't forget the letter. I have it! - Hold this, it's important. - Important? I'm glad to see that our brief history together has left no trace. None at all. I've forgotten it all. Me too, I forgot all about the tons of tobacco. I forgot about the postcards. I forgot about the daisies. Well then, you see. - We've forgotten it all. - All of it. - Monchablon! - What? - The goatee! - What goatee? I can't find the Cardinal's goatee. Well never mind then! Here you are at last! - If you only knew! - What happened? - I did something terrible. - Later, go get dressed. What! I won't be good without my goatee! - I'll be inferior to myself. - It's not even possible. Richelieu without a goatee... What about the facts? That's enough! - Are you happy then? - Very happy. - Can't you tell? - Of course. You have your plays and celebrity. All that doesn't matter. What matters is to love and to be loved. I thought my uncle was only a friend. It's not your uncle. - Are you in love? - It's my right. And he loves you back? Madly! - Who is he? - My lover. "Countess, is this your spectre, the terrifying Maupouille? He just asked me out to dinner. Don't think of it! Don't you know of this libertine's reputation and all his debauchery?" I was losing with the reds so I chose black. My goodness... Did you lose then? Of course. "Thirty Years of a Gambler's Life", I was very good in it. I gambled more to make up for my losses. How much did you lose then? - 40,000... - Did you have 40,000 francs? No, I didn't. Monchablon, I'm so sorry! I'm begging you, Monchablon, tell me you forgive me. - Did you take it from our till? - Yes. Dear God! "Hide the knife, this blade never gave in. And I won't give in either. Beautiful knife, if I were to disgrace you, let us then be united in blood. " Are you still here? I wasn't going to leave like that. - You have a lover! - Yes, sir. He's a real man, he sends me flowers and letters. I keep his letters close to my heart. I challenge you to tell me his name. Is that so? His name is Pierre Marie Auguste Brion and I'm his mistress! Do you hear me? - It can't be. - Why? Because I'm Pierre Marie Auguste Brion. It's me. "It's me, Captain of Soissons!" So what's in this letter? It says: "Miss, I love you. " I have the draft right here. - It was you! - Yes. - What about your wedding? - Well, the thing is... Well, I'm very shy. I'd always thought that something good would happen, that my fianc?e would break a leg or my father-in-law would get arrested, but nothing. Oh, dear... Careful! If this is being respectable... I don't know what happened to me, a dizzy spell maybe. What is it? It was my mum but I don't want to see anyone but you. I'll send you to the judge! I'll kill myself first... right after my scene! That's a true artist! "What did I just hear? You let the dove defy the tiger in its den? It's an affair of state, madam. Cardinal. All of my subjects must sacrifice their blood to the kingdom. I can see you're upset. " It's just the... here! "I'm here incognito! My lord, if my child succeeds, you'll have the proof you asked for in a few minutes. If this is true, I'll give you back your possessions. But if you lied, my vengeance shall be terrible!" - I've always loved you. - Really? I ran off because I thought you were engaged. I just wanted to hurt you. It's a proof of love. I agreed to this marriage to get back at you. It's also a proof of love. Proofs of love are always meant to hurt the people we love. Indeed. Miquette, we'll be so happy together. Yes. We'll get married and have many children. Yes, all the time! But what about my uncle? And my plays. - I have to go on stage. - Not so fast. One thing first... "She said she'd be here as the clock chimes midnight. Listen to Saint-Germain I'Auxerrois' bell. " I'm late, wait for me here. "Nine. Ten. Eleven. Here she comes! Here comes our dear Ang?lique. Thirteen. And a quarter. - She's always on time. - The clock might be fast. " Shut up, No?mie! "She must be coming up the stairs. I'm worried, I'll go get her. Hurray! I'm right on time. Come give me a hug, my brave child. " - You owe me a fine. - I don't care, I'm happy. "We'll get him this time! Thanks to her, the evil Mr Maupouille will be executed. The letter you managed to steal will cost him the favour of the Cardinal. " The letter. The letter! I don't know where it is. "We will have a good laugh, Mr Maupouille! Well, my sweet girl?" Where could it be? "Isn't the precious missive here, on your breast? Yes, of course! What was I thinking? "To my lord, the Duke of York, Captain of the English fleet on the ?le de R?. " Traitor! What does he say to his lord, the Duke of York? "Miss, I love you. " It must be some secret code but we'll see through it. " - Prompt it to me. - I don't know it. Prompt it to me. "My dear Captain de Soissons. Please decipher this letter for us. Alas, my lord. I'm but a mere soldier and I can't read. - But... - Me neither! But after all... The Cardinal here is the interested party in this matter. " Bastard! What's wrong with you? - I'm in love! - That's all we needed! - I'm getting married. - You're mad. "What do you think, Cardinal? My eyesight is rather bad and I forgot my glasses. Whatever, here's the confession. I got the general meaning of it. The English want to take advantage of the siege in La Rochelle in order to kill me. Let us ride to La Rochelle and ambush them! Let us ambush them! Our dear Olivier will go first. You'll sneak among our enemies and find out their intentions. - I'll go with you, Father. - Come, my dear child. For God, the king and the nation! Here they go on their horses. " - You are in love then. - Yes, I'm in love. You used to tell me I couldn't say it properly. Now I can say it right: I'm in love. I'm in love! - I'm in love! - You fool! An actress can't have a heart before 40 or she's done for. I don't care. You're lucky I'm here, I won't let you start an affair. I told you it's no affair, it's a marriage. A beautiful and a real one. Agreeing to a marriage with your talent! Here's a woman who could have a normal life and she wants to get married. Us actors aren't made for marriage. Actors can't get married. Look at Moli?re... and me! - I'll leave your company. - What are you saying? Would you give up your career? - Happily. - Don't be silly. I must tell you that earlier, two men asked to see me, two writers from Paris. They didn't want to hire me but you. You could start in Paris in three months if you wanted. - I don't care. - Would you rather waste your life? - I won't waste it. - Well your husband's then? What? Come on in. It's no longer the old actor talking, honey. The talentless old actor. I have no talent, or maybe I have too much. The audience can't see the difference. I'll talk to you as a man who cares about you. Don't do it! You'd stop acting but your husband would remain married to an actress. People would turn their backs on him, they'd mock him and all of Paris would call him "Mr Miquette". Mr Miquette... that's awful! People will also say terrible things about the Marquis. That's terrible! You're too proud to have as your dowry the mocking of the audience and your mother's debts. What? She went to the casino. She gambled and lost the company's money, the comrades' money! 40,000 francs! Will you ask your fianc? for it? No, I'd never do such a thing. Dear God, what will I do? Go get changed, honey. The storm is coming. Start the rain. Panouillard? Panouillard! Yes? I need you, Panouillard. Wait, just one more... I'm all yours. The Marquis is in the audience. - Go get him. - Is it urgent? Very. Wait a minute... Someone is waiting for me by the little bridge. A young man? Give him this letter. It's your turn. Being young and in love, how beautiful! Do this for me, please. Prosper! Where are you going? - I've had enough, I'm off home. - Come and sit down. Don't protest. The girl is great in the next scene. She might be great but you won't get to enjoy it. - What are you saying? - The truth, pal. People say you think you're after Miquette, although you're clearly after her mother. These people are idiots! Right, I agree with them nonetheless. Then you're an idiot too. Do you think I'm too old for this? Couldn't I be loved and cheated on still? - Yes. - Do you think I'm like you? A decrepit old coot? A cracked ruin? A pale memory? - That's enough. - Here you go! If you want to know my thoughts, I think you're fat and disgusting. Get lost or I'll say nasty things to you. I'm leaving. I just have one last word for you: You're mean! What a rude man! Will you let me go? Let me go! What's wrong with you? I'm really sorry. If you knew what's in there. I don't want to know. I'm tired of doing Miquette favours. Don't leave me alone. All I can do is die now. Go ahead! Let's go! To the monastery, now! Hurry up! You wanted to see me. Yes. Aldebert... What did you just say? I said... - Yes, Aldebert. - It can't be true. Did you forget what it means? It means... It means Aldebert! I didn't forget. Well then, that makes me so happy. Lovely Miquette, you called me Aldebert so nicely and simply. After six months. I'm so happy! Are you happy too, Miquette? - Yes. - Yes! Well... It's neither nice nor pretty what I was about to do here. I'm very sorry, Miquette. Sorry? I'm sorry for being an old coot. You're not old. Well I'm a coot and the thing is... I thought I was a bon vivant and a prankster. But it's not true and it makes me blush. I'm a good man. Kiss me. Yes... With all my heart. "You shouldn't have come. Please go away. Forget about me. Don't try to see me again, I'm a bad person, a monster without scruples who breaks men's hearts with her laugh. Adieu. I don't love you. " Me neither. What a mean girl. Tell me the truth. Why did you start calling me Aldebert? Well the truth is... Please, don't get mad. My mum lost all of the company's money at the roulette. It's terrible. Not at all, it's endearing! Isn't your mother charming? The dizzy spender... She's the complete opposite to you. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. "Don't try to hide in the dark, you nasty Brit! My sword will find its way to your throat. " The body, Miquette. - The body! - Right, the body. "Die, you traitor! The beast will bite no more. " Well then, are you completely happy now? Completely. Miquette? Is there something else? Yes. But it's personal. Don't say a word, I understand. It's a heartache, isn't it? Of course, it's obvious. It's normal at your age, I should have known. - You seem upset. - Why would I be upset? - Why should I care? - You seem mad. You're right, I'm furious. I can't believe you're in love. Don't worry, I told him goodbye. I won't see him again. Do you think I would allow it? I don't want to marry him and you'd agree if you knew. Who is he? - Your nephew. - Urbain? - My goodness. - See? - My goodness, I'm so happy. - Excuse me? The idiot! It's still my name and my ch?teau. It's like you're marrying me, I'm so happy! You're always happy! It's horrible! Careful, Miquette! "At the foot of this wall, the sea is dark and deep. It takes good care of the secrets that we entrust it with. Tell me, Abbess, is the bag strongly tied? I weighted it with a heavy chain. Shall it drag him to the bottom of hell. Go tell your brothers that we're waiting for them! Look out, my friends! English boats are accosting. The battle will rage soon. I'll assemble my men. My brave and courageous child... " Sir, I won't greet you. What are you doing here? I've been thinking. I might be fat but not enough to digest your insult. - Here's my card. - Don't be so sharp. You can't be sharp and never will be. I want to apologise. - It's a crying shame. - I got carried away, it was silly. - That's very true. - Let us shake hands. - With all my heart! - There. I was the one in the wrong. It's obvious that Miquette is your mistress. Congratulations, she's exquisite. Do you really think that I'm this girl's lover? I have no doubts about it. Well, you're a pig! "Look out!" But... Do you believe that I'm as evil as you are? "Long live the king!" Such vengeful feelings! That's no apology! Exactly and I'm happy to say it to your face: - You're a lout! - Aldebert! You're a puppet and a dirty man. Aldebert! I've seen enough of you, get lost! "I'm going home. " Get lost! I've got one thing left to say: don't try to apologise again, I won't suffer it. "They're beating a retreat. But... Isn't that boat coming towards us?" - Did you think about it? - It's a no. I don't want Urbain to be mocked. What? "They're loading the cannons and firing at us. " I want you to marry him. Never! I have stunning willpower. That's my line! I'll convince you! I dare you to. She dares me... I'll show the girl! I'll change her mind. No one ever defied me in vain. Mrs Grandier, I've never been defied in vain. You scared me! You almost caught me naked. - That's not the issue. - Please! It's been such an emotional day, my heart is all worked up. It's not about your heart, it's about... Turn around. Go over there, you're all the same. Don't dare look. For God's sake, let me talk. Urbain is here. Miquette won't marry him, what do you have to say? I don't know, I feel dizzy all of a sudden. Come on. Come back to your senses, we're in a hurry. My smelling salts. She has no self-control but what beautiful... arms. Beautiful... arms... The salts! Feeling better? - Where am I? - Right here. Help me, my dear friend, or I'll miss my entrance. Will you do something? Yes, but be gentle, very gentle. If Miquette refuses... Then she's silly. If you were in her shoes, you wouldn't refuse to marry my nephew, would you? Of course I would, I'm too old for him. That's not what I mean. To make it simpler, let's pretend you're Miquette and I'm Urbain. You're Miquette and I'm Urbain. She really doesn't get it! Let's make it even simpler. Let's imagine that it's about you and me. If I were to tell you: "Mrs Grandier, I like you very much and you like me a lot. Will you marry me? We'll be very happy together and have no children. " What would you say? I... I'd say no. Why on earth would you say no? You're a noble woman, good enough for us. My mother-in-law was a Pichon. Pichon! How marvellous! And you have beautiful arms too! Marquis! You'd be perfect at la Tour-Mirande in that dress. I want you to be my wife, Mrs Grandier. I must be dreaming! Come on, madam! Are you sleeping in here? - Coming! - You're on next. "The British fleet is on fire!" - The British fleet is on fire! - I know! It's on fire! "Hurray to Count Soissons' soldiers! It burns! It burns!" Say yes, Hermine! Hermine! You've given me back my name after 15 years. You've given me so much more. What then? Yesterday, I was too young. Ten minutes ago I was too old. Now, I'm finally my age. - My dear friend. - Hermine, please call me Aldebert. Give me a kiss. Aldebert! My lord! I'm dazzled and my brain is fuzzy. You're getting used to your rank, Marquise! "Blessed be our lord, here come the musketeers. Hurray!" You let the Marquis kiss you now? - He's my fianc?. - My goodness! "I'm on my way to meet our heroes. Keep walking, rascal. To the ground, boor. I'm a Duke and an ally of France! You'll explain yourself to the Cardinal. I'll do whatever I want! It seems like they've made a high-ranking prisoner. Victory! Victory!" Why won't you marry Urbain? - Because of the Marquis. - We're engaged now. "Uncle, I'm handing this wretch over to you! You're finished! Would you take with you to the grave the secret of her birth? You asked for it, Olivier de M?dan! Ang?lique, you're my daughter. Good heavens! In that case, you're my mother! - This is your aunt. - You're all so naive. Justice has been done. My dear nephew, here is the reward for your feat. I join you in wedlock, my sweet children. Let us thank the Lord, the road to La Rochelle is open! To La Rochelle! To La Rochelle! To La Rochelle. " You'll get married then. I wrote to Urbain... To tell him you love him? He'll be here tomorrow. - No, that I don't love him. - He'll be here tonight. I won't see him again. He's there! Bravo, Miquette, bravo! - Careful! - Bravo! - Miss... - Later, later! I think there's no need to insist, gentlemen. - Urbain! - Miquette! I might be too zealous. You're beautiful! Miquette? These are the two writers from Paris that I told you about. Mr Robert de Flers and Mr de Caillavet. - We were hoping to hire you. - Too late, gentlemen. I'm not acting anymore. - She's a countess now. - We figured. - If not our star... - You could be our heroine. We could write a comedy about your life and call it... - "Miquette gets married". - Alright. - I'm against it. - But madam! Unless you call it "Miquette and her mother"! That's a true artist!
