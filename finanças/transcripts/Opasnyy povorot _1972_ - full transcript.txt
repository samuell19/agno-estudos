MOSFILM Creative Association TELEFILM John Boynton Priestley DANGEROUS CORNER Oh, what a fool I was. - You? - Yes, of course. I ought to have gone straight to Martin and told him what Stanton had told me. If this is true, then the person really responsible is Stanton. - Yes. - Rubbish! It isn't. Don't you see what you did? No, because I don't believe it. Because you don?t choose to, that?s all. Oh, talk sense. Can't you see Martin had his own reasons? No. What drove Martin to suicide was my stupidity and your damned lying, Stanton. Be calm! Pray, be calm, Betty! Don't worry. But this has got to be settled, once and for all. You're none of you in a state to settle anything. - Listen to me, Stanton! - Oh, drop it, man. You've got to answer. I'll never forgive you for telling Martin what you did - by God I won't! You've got it all wrong. They haven't, you rotten liar! Oh, get out! You made Martin shoot himself. Wait! Wait a minute. Martin didn't shoot himself. John Boynton Priestley DANGEROUS CORNER Part Three Martin didn't..? Of course he didn't. I shot him. Olwen... That's ridiculous... Olwen, you couldn't have done. Is... is this your idea of a joke? I wish it was. She... must... must... be... hysterical or something. I believe people often confess to all sorts of mad things in that state; things they could not possibly have done. Never... Olwen's not hysterical. She means it. But she can't mean - she murdered him. Can she? You might... as well tell us exactly what happened now, Olwen, if you can stand it. And I might as well tell you - before you begin - that I'm not at all surprised. I suspected it was you at the first. You suspected I'd done it? But why? For three reasons. The first was that I couldn't understand why Martin should shoot himself. You see, I knew he hadn't taken the money, and though he was in every kind of mess, he didn?t seem to me the sort of chap who?d get out of it that way. Then I knew you'd been with him quite late, because - as I said before - I'd been told you'd gone that way. And the third reason... Well, that'll keep... You'd better tell us what happened, now. It was an accident, wasn't it? Yes, it was really an accident. I'll tell you what happened... I think we?d all better... tell everything we know now, really speak our minds. I agree. - Will you have a drink before you begin? - I'll just have a little soda-water... - Sit here, Olwen. - Thank you. I'll sit by the fire. I went to see Martin that Saturday night, as you know, to talk to him about the missing money. Mr Whitehouse had told me about it. He thought that either Martin or Robert must have taken it. I didn't like Martin and he knew it, but he knew, too, what I felt about Robert, He believed that Robert had taken the money and he wasn't a bit worried about it. I'm sorry, Robert, but he wasn't. He was rather maliciously amused. The good brother fallen at last. I can believe that. I hate to, but I know he could be like that sometimes. You found that too, that day? Yes, he was in one of his worst moods. He could be cruel - torturing - sometimes. I've never seen him as bad as he was that night. He wasn't really sane. - Olwen. I'm sorry, Robert. I didn't want you to know all this, but there's no help for it now. You see, Martin had been taking some sort of drug... Drug! Do you mean dope stuff? Yes. He'd had a lot of it. Are you sure? It's true, Caplan. I knew it. So did I. He made me try some once, but I didn't like it. It just made me feel rather sick. He liked it... and took more and more of it. But where did he get it? Through some man he knew in town. When he couldn't get it, he was... I... Not so bad as those dope fiends one reads about... but nevertheless, pretty rotten. But didn't you try to stop him? Of course - but he only laughed. I don't blame him really. We knew nothing of it... None of you can understand what life was like to Martin - he was so sensitive and nervy. He... He was one of those people... who are meant to he happy. We're all those people who are meant to be happy. Martin's no exception. Yes, that's true. You are right, Stanton, but I know what Gordon means. You couldn't help knowing what he means, if you knew Martin. There was no sort of middle state, no easy jog-trot with him. Either he had to be gay, he was gayer than anybody else in the world or he was intensely miserable. I'm like that. Everybody is - aren't they? - except old and stuffy people. But what about this drug, Olwen? He took some... while I was there. It was in little... white tablets... and it had a horrible effect on him. It gave him a sort of devilish gaiety. I can see him now. His eyes were queer. Oh - he really wasn't sane. What happened? It's horrible to talk about. I've tried not to think... ...about it. He knew... I disliked him, but he couldn't believe I really disliked him. He was frightfully conceited about himself. He seemed to think that everybody ought to be falling in love with him. Yes, he did. And he'd every reason to. He began taunting me. He thought of me as a priggish spinster full of repressions, who?d never really lived. He spoke at length on this subject. I ought to have run out and left him, but I felt I couldn't while he was in that state. In a way I was sorry for him, because really he was ill, sick in mind and body. I might dislike him, but after all he wasn't a stranger. He was one of our own set, mixed up with most of the people I liked best in the world. But everything I said seemed to make him worse. And then he tried to show me... some beastly foul drawings he had. - Oh, my God! Oh, Freda, Freda, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. I'm so sorry... - Martin! Martin! - Don?t listen to any more. I?ll stop if you like. - Oh, no... - Or go and lie down. I couldn't. If you'd known him as I'd known him - before. I know that. We all do. He was different. He was ill. Go on, Olwen. Yes, Olwen. You can't stop now. Go on. There isn't a lot to tell now. When I pushed... his beastly drawings away... and was rather indignant about them, he got still more excited, completely unbalanced. He tried to tear my clothes. I was running for the door. But then he stood between me and the door. And he had a revolver in his hand and was shouting something about danger and terror and love. He was just waving it about - being dramatic. I didn?t even believe it was loaded. I told him to get out of the way. When he wouldn?t, I tried to push him out of the way. And then we had a struggle. It was horrible. He wasn?t any stronger than I was. I?d grabbed the hand... I?d turned... the revolver... towards him. His finger must have been on the trigger. I must have given it a jerk. The revolver went off. I?ve tried and tried to forget that. If he?d just been wounded, I?m sure I would have stopped with him. But he was dead. You needn't tell us. When I realized what had happened, I rushed out and sat in my car outside for I don?t know how long. I couldn?t move a finger. And it was so quiet in the cottage, so horribly quiet. You know how lonely that cottage was. I just sat on and on in the car, shivering. I?ve gone through that over and over again. God! You can't be blamed, Olwen. Of course she can't be blamed. And there must never be a word spoken about this - not to anybody. We must all promise that. It's a pity we can't all be as cool and business-like about this as you are, Stanton. I don't feel very cool and business-like about it. But you see, it's not as big a surprise to me as it is to you people. I guessed long ago that something like this had happened. But it looked so much like suicide that nobody bothered to suggest it wasn't. I can?t think how you could have guessed even though you knew Olwen had been there. I told you I had a third reason. I was over fairly early next morning - the postmistress rang me up - and I was there before anybody but the village constable and the doctor. And I spotted something on the floor that the village bobby had missed, and I picked it up. I?ve kept it in my pocket-book ever since. I?m rather observant about such things. Let me see. Yes, that's a piece of the dress I was wearing. So that's how you knew? That's how I knew. But why didn't you say anything? I can tell you that. Because he wanted everybody to think that Martin had shot himself. That meant that Martin must have taken the money. That?s about it, I suppose. It falls into line with everything we?ve heard from him tonight. No, there happened to be another reason, much more important. I knew that if Olwen had had a hand in Martin's death, then something like that must have happened... So Olwen couldn?t be blamed. I knew her better than any of you. I understood her better... or I felt I did. And I trusted her. She?s about the only person I would trust. She knows all about that. I?ve told her often enough. She's not interested, but there it is. And you never even hinted to me that you knew. Surprising, isn't it? What a chance I missed to capture your interest for a few minutes. I suppose even nowadays, when we?re all so damned tough, there has got to be one person that you behave to always as if you were Sir Roger de Coverly, and with me you?ve been that person for a long time now. And I knew all along that you were saying nothing because you thought Robert here had taken the money, and that he was safe after everybody put it down to Martin. And that didn?t always make it any easier for me. But what a fine romantic character you are, aren't you? Steady, Betty. You don't understand. How could she? Why do you say that - in that tone of voice? Why does one say anything - in any tone of voice? You know, I nearly did take you into my confidence. And that might have made a difference. But I chose a bad moment. Why? When was this? Tell me. I told you I sat in my car for some time not able to do anything... But then, when I felt a little better, I felt I had to tell somebody, to tell somebody about all, and you were the nearest person. - But you didn't go there that night? Yes, I did. I drove over to your cottage and I got there about eleven o?clock. I left my car and walked up to your cottage. And then - I walked back again. You walked up to the cottage? I walked right up to your cottage and saw enough to set me walking straight back again. So that's when you came. After that, it was hopeless, I suppose? Quite hopeless. I think that added the last touch to that night. I don?t think I?ve ever felt the same about people not just here, but everybody... And you must all have noticed that I?ve been completely off country cottages. Yes, even Betty's noticed that. Why? Why, what's the matter, Betty? What's the matter, Betty? Betty? What's the matter? What a... You... What a little liar you are, Betty. Haven't we all been liars? But you... But you haven't, Betty. Oh, don't be a fool, Robert. Of course she has. She's lied like fury. What about? Why don't you ask her? Oh, what does it matter? Leave the child alone. I'm not a child. That's the mistake you've all made. Not you - and Stanton? Is that what they mean? Why don't you tell them it's ridiculous? How can she, Robert? Don't be absurd. You see, Robert, I saw them both in Stanton's cottage that night. I'm sorry, Olwen, but I won't take even your word for this. Besides, there are other possible explanations. Oh, drop this, Caplan. We've had too much of it already. I'm going. You're not going. Don't be a fool. It's no business of yours. That's where you're wrong, Stanton. This is where Robert's business really begins. I'm waiting for an answer, Betty. What do you want me to say? Were you with Stanton at his cottage? Yes. Were you his mistress? Yes. How could you, Betty? But why - in God?s name - why? How could you? How could you? How could I? Because I'm not a child, and I'm not a little stuffed doll. You would drag all this out and now you can damned well have it. Yes, I stayed with Stanton that night, and I've stayed with him other nights. And he's not in love with me and I'm not in love with him. I wouldn't marry him if I could But I'd got to make something happen. Gordon was driving me mad. If you want to call someone a child, then call him one. Betty darling and Gordon darling. It?s just nothing - pretence, pretence, pretence. He... He... And the very sight of him makes me want to scream. - Betty, you mustn't go... It's not my fault. I was in love with him when we were married and I thought everything was going to be marvellous. He can't even talk to me. For God's sake, shut up, Betty. I won't shut up. They want to know the truth and they can have it. I don't care. I've had nothing out of my marriage but shame and misery. Betty, that's simply nonsense. If I were the nice little doll you all thought me, perhaps it wouldn't have mattered. But I'm not. I'm not a child either. And Stanton was the one person who guessed what was happening. I wouldn?t have blamed you if you?d gone and fallen in love, but this was just a low sordid intrigue, a dirty little affair, not worth all your silly lies. I suppose Stanton was the rich uncle in America who kept giving you all those fine presents? Yes, he was. You couldn't even be generous. I knew Stanton didn't really care for me, so I got what I could out of him. It served you right. Men who say they?re in love with one woman and keep spending their weekends with another deserve all they get. Is that why you suddenly found yourself so short of money, Stanton? Yes. Queer how it works out... Then Betty is responsible for everything... You see! For Martin. Always Martin. Always Martin! If I was responsible for all that, then it?s your fault really Because you're responsible for everything that happened to me. You ought never to have married me. It was a mistake. We seem to make that kind of mistake in our family. I ought to have left you long before this. That was my mistake - trying to make the best of it. pretending to be married to somebody who wasn?t there. Yes, I think I am dead. I think I died last summer. Olwen shot me. Gordon, I think that?s unfair... and also rather stupid and affected. It may have sounded like that, but it wasn't. I meant it. I began this. Well, I?ll finish it. I'll say something now. Betty, I worshipped you. I suppose you knew that? If she didn't, she must have been very dense. I'm talking to Betty now. You might leave us alone for a minute, Freda. Did you realize that I felt like that, Betty? Yes. But I didn't care very much. No, why should you? No, it isn't that. But I knew you weren't in love with me. You were only worshipping somebody you?d invented. And that?s not the same thing at all. I thought that you and Gordon were reasonably happy together. Yes, we put up a good show, didn't we? You did. Yes, we did. What would have happened if we'd gone on pretending like hell to be happy together? Nothing. No. If we?d gone on pretending long enough, we might have been happy together. It often works out like that. Never. Yes it does. That's why all this is so wrong really. The real truth is something so deep... you can't get at it this way, and all this half-truth... does is to blow everything up. It isn't civilized. I agree. You agree. You'll get no sympathy from me, Robert. Sympathy from you. I never want to set eyes on you again, Stanton. You're a thief, a cheat, a liar, and a dirty, cheap seducer. And you're a fool, Caplan. You look solid, but you're not. You?ve a good deal in common with that cracked brother of yours. You won?t face up to real things. You?ve been living in a fool?s paradise, and now, having got yourself out of it by tonight?s efforts - all your doing - you?re busy building yourself a fool?s hell to live in. I think this was your glass. Your glass? And now take yourself after it. Get out. Get out. Good night. I'm sorry, Olwen, about all this - So am I. Good night. Good night, Freda. Good night. I suppose you're coming along? Gordon? Not with you, I'm afraid. And don't forget, Stanton, you owe the firm five hundred pounds and a resignation. Oh, you're going to take it that way, are you? Yes, I'm going to take it that way. You'll regret it. Don?t be too hasty, Gordon. Whatever his faults, Stanton?s a first-class man at his job. If he goes, the firm will suffer. I can't help it. I couldn't work with him after this. The firm will have to suffer, that?s all. That?s all. Don't worry. The firm?s smashed to hell now. Nonsense. Is it? I don't think so. No, don't trouble. I can find my way out. Good night. Well, Betty darling, my sweetie. I think we'd better return to our happy little home, our dear little nest... Oh, don't, Gordon. I'll let you out. Why do you look like that? I am not looking at you. I don't know you. I'm not saying goodbye to you. I'm saying goodbye... ...to this. That's all. The elegantly packaged filth. Robert, please don't drink any more tonight. I know how you feel, but it'll only make you worse. What does it matter? I'm through, anyway. Robert, I can't bear seeing you like this. You don't know how it hurts me. I'm sorry, Olwen, I really am sorry. You're the only one who's really come out of this. Strange, isn't it - that you should have been feeling like that about me all the time? Yes, all the time. - I'm sorry, Olwen. - I'm not. I mean about myself. I suppose I ought to be, but I?m not. It?s hurt like anything sometimes, but it's kept me going too. I know. Now I?ve stopped going. Something's broken - inside. It never does. It won?t seem bad tomorrow. It's always been the case. All this isn?t going to seem any better tomorrow, Olwen Freda will help too. After all, Robert, she's fond of you. No, not really. It isn?t that she dislikes me steadily, but every now and then she hates me - and now I see why, of course. Because I?m Robert Caplan and not Martin, because he?s dead and I?m alive. She may feel differently - after tonight. She may. I doubt it. She doesn't change easily - that's the trouble. And then again, I don?t care any more. Whether she changes or doesn't change I don't care now. And you know there?s nothing I wouldn?t do, Robert. I?ll run away this very minute with you if you like. I'm terribly grateful, Olwen. But nothing happens here - inside. Nothing happens. All hollow, empty. I'm sure it's not at all the proper thing to say at such a moment, the fact remains that I feel rather hungry. What about you, Olwen? You, Robert? Or have you been drinking too much? Yes, I've been drinking too much. Drinking too much... Well, it's very silly of you. Yes. Very silly... And you did ask for all this. I asked for it. And I got it. Though I doubt if you minded very much until it came to Betty. That's not true. But I can understand your thinking so. You see, as more and more of this rotten stuff came out, so more and more I came to depend on my secret thoughts of Betty - as someone who seemed to me to represent some lovely quality of life. I've known some time that you were getting very sentimental and noble about her. And I've known some time, too, all about Betty, and I've often thought of telling you. I'm not sorry you didn't. You ought to be. - Why? - That kind of self-deception's rather stupid. What about you and Martin? I didn't deceive myself. I knew everything - or nearly everything - about him. I wasn't in love with somebody who really wasn't there, somebody I'd made up. I think you were. Probably we always are. Then it?s not so bad then. You can always build up another image for yourself to fall in love with. No, you can't. That's the trouble. You lose the capacity for building. You run short of the stuff that creates beautiful illusions. Then you have to learn to live without illusions. Can't be done. Not for us. We started life too early for that. Possibly they're breeding people now who can live without illusions. I hope so. But I can't do it. I've lived among illusions. You have. Well, what if I have? They've given me hope and courage. They've helped me to live. I suppose we ought to get all that from faith in life. But I haven't got any. No religion or anything. Just... this... damned farmyard to live in. That's all. Then why didn?t you leave them alone, instead of clamouring for the truth all night... ...like a fool? Because I am a fool. Stanton was right. That's the only answer. I began this evening with something... with something... something... to keep me going. Martin... I?d good memories of Martin. I?d a wife... who didn?t love me but at least seemed too good for me. I?d two partners I liked and respected. There was a girl I could idealize. And now... - No, Robert - please. We know. But you don't know, you can't know - not as I know - or you wouldn't stand there like that, as if we?d only just had some damned... silly little... squabble about a hand at bridge. - Robert, please... Don't you see, we're not living in the same world now. Everything's gone. My brother was an obscene lunatic... - Stop that! And my wife doted on him and pestered him. of my partners is a liar and a cheat and a thief. The other... God knows what he is - some sort of hysterical young pervert. And the girl?s... a greedy little cat on the tiles. - No, Robert, no. This is horrible! Please, please don't go on. It won't seem like this tomorrow. Tomorrow? Tomorrow... There can't be a tomorrow. He?s got a revolver there. Stop! Stop, Robert! It can't happen! It can't happen... And that's that. I hope it didn't bore you, Miss Mockridge? Not in the least. How many scenes did we miss? Five, I think. I suppose they must have been telling a lot of lies in those scenes. That's why that man was so angry - the husband, I mean. Listen to the men. They're probably laughing at something very improper. No, just gossip. Men gossip like anything. They've got a marvellous excuse now that they're all three directors of the firm. What a snug little group you are. Snug little group... How awful! Enchanting. I hate to leave it. I should think you do. must be so comforting to be all so settled. Pretty good. But I suppose you all miss your brother-in-law. He used to be down here with you too, didn't he? You mean Robert's brother, Martin? Oh, have I dropped a brick? I always am dropping bricks. No, not at all. It was distressing for us at the time, but it's all right now. Martin shot himself. Oh yes - dreadful business, of course. He was very handsome, wasn't he? Yes, very handsome. Who's very handsome? Not you, Charles. They were talking about me. Betty, my girl, why do you allow them all to talk about your husband in this fulsome fashion? Darling, I'm sure you've had too much manly gossip and old brandy. Sorry to be so late, Freda - but it's that wretched puppy of yours. Oh, what's it been doing now? It was eating the script of Sonia William's new novel, and I thought it might make him sick. You see, how we talk of you novelists. Yes, I heard you. I've just been saying what a charming cosy little group you've made here. I think you've been lucky. It's not all luck, Miss Mockridge. You see, we all happen to be nice easy-going people. Except Betty - she's terribly wild. That's only because Gordon doesn't beat her often enough - yet. You see, Miss Peel, Mr. Stanton is still the cynical bachelor. I'm afraid he rather spoils the picture. Well... What's disturbing the ether tonight? Anybody know? Oh, Gordon, don't start it again. We've only just turned it off. What did you hear? The last half of a play. It was called 'The Sleeping Dog'. Why? We're not sure - something to do with lies, and a gentleman shooting himself. What fun they have at the BBC. Yes, don't they? Shots and things. You know, I believe I understand that play now. The sleeping dog was the truth, and that man - the husband - insisted upon disturbing it. He was quite right to disturb it. I think telling the truth... ...telling the truth is about as healthy as skidding round a corner at sixty. And life's got a lot of dangerous corners - hasn't it, Charles? It can have - if you don't choose your route well. Let's talk about something more amusing. Drinks, Robert. And cigarettes. There aren't any here. There are some in this one. Oh, I remember that box. It plays a tune at you, doesn't it ? I remember the tune. Yes, it's the Wedding March, isn't it? Wait a minute. Listen to this. Oh, I adore that tune. What is it? It's a foxtrot. What? It's a foxtrot... Miss Mockridge? When autumn lives to see the falling snow Like humans live to see the wrinkled face, Just wrap yourself in plaid, relax And lay a fire in the fire-place. Then fill your pipe, breathe deeply in To fill the darkness with the smoke of blue And take my word, the word of gentleman, The world will seem quite different to you. The world will seem quite different to you. The window now has melted, and your glass Is now as good as empty, and your soul And heart may not be warm enough, alas, But you can warm your body, after all. To while away the winter time with ease And keep yourself from cold and chills and gloom Provide yourself with candles for the night And lay a fire in the sitting room, And lay a fire in the sitting room. The winter winds are blowing now The smoky fog is rising now With heavy sticky snow We?ve got the storm all night again But we?ll forget before too long All our grieves when we go wrong And we will be able To understand each other?s pain.
