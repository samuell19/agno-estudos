A newly-printed banknote is put into circulation after leaving the factory. After some time, it will become used and old. A 1,000-dollar note has a longer lifespan because people cherish it more. Usually, it lasts as long as 18 months. A 100-dollar note doesn't last that long. Its usual lifespan is 12 months. You stepped on me! You jerk! -Get it, it's cheap! -Thank you. Here. A 10-dollar note has an even shorter lifespan. It usually lasts for eight months. 10 DOLLARS EACH But for him, it has surpassed its limit. STANDARD CHARTERED BANK The bank collects the old banknotes. After tallying up the amount using high-accuracy counters, the notes are then shredded. The pieces are then sent to the garbage incineration center to be burned like other trash. For you. No wonder my mom complains that money is worthless. What happens next? -I don't understand, sorry. -Let me talk. We treat it like trash and send it off to be burned. How many months per incineration? Not how many months, but every week. Sometimes, even every day. Yes. Right, let's take a look at the incineration process. It's just like burning trash. Hey, hurry up. The boss wants to watch himself on TV. It's airing soon. Let me know when I'm on. Okay. Get back to work. The plug doesn't fit. What a dimwit. Go away! Let me do it. It should be the other cable. I see you, Helen. What? Really? -It has started. -Come. -Come and watch. -I'm coming. -That's me. -Boss, you're on TV. -Look. -Hey, really. Boss, something is wrong with the machine. -What's going on? -What's going on? The machine is acting weird! -I know, I'm trying to fix it! -Shut up. Let him do it. -It's playing. -Okay. Something is not right! What about the banknotes? -Just leave them and burn them later. -Leave them. Come and watch. Thirty million dollars? Quiet, everybody. -Look. -You look fat on TV. I'm getting famous. Wow, you have personality. Come on. Boss. Here. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED AREA NO ENTRY WITHOUT PERMISSION Fatty, why are you so late today? We need to get off work. The plant closes at 1 p.m. We work according to rules. Today is a weekend. We shut the machine at a quarter to 12. Then, we wash our hands, shower and put on clean clothes. It will be 1 p.m. sharp when we leave the door. What if you aren't done burning them? Lock it up and continue next Monday. Sir, next Monday is a public holiday. Tuesday then. Mr. Thomson, a call for you. SAY NO TO OVERTIME Right on time. No luck for you, Fatty. Come back on Tuesday. We have rules. Come earlier next time. Fatty. You've been holding air and standing like that for a while. -Anything wrong? -No. I was feeling proud. I managed to build up a career with my own hands. And I love Hong Kong. When the opportunity arises, it's hard not to prosper. A car shows up when I put my hand out. Not my personal ride, but that's okay. Don't even think about emigrating because most of us can't leave anyway. Let's make Hong Kong better together. Bye! A lunatic. That guy is made from Hong Kong. HAVE YOU LATCHED THE DOOR? -Sorry. -What are you doing? Pick it up. Okay. -I'm sorry. -Mark. Sorry. Mark, there's money to be picked up. I'm working. -Forget that. Leave. -Don't bother me. It's 30 million dollars. -Thirty million? -Hey, get to work. Hey, go and bring Tomboy. Her dad is scary. Why do you ask me? -Just go. -No, you go. Guess the number in my head. From one to ten. Three. It's seven. Go ahead. How could I guess that? Hey, buddy. Tomboy, quit slacking. Who kicked me? Damn, I'm dead. -Cover me. -Did you kick me, Fatty? It's not me, sir. Damn Tomboy, are you trying to kill me? Get out of here. My dad's going to kill you. Bye! -My car. -Let's get out of here. Don't go! I'm talking about 30 million dollars. We'll swim in cash. Hey. Stop eating and help think of a plan. I already have one. Bring three bags of paper to swap with the real thing. That doesn't work. How about you? Thirty million dollars. It's my first time hearing that figure. We'll be rich. It's been approved to be burned. Might as well let us have it. And disrupt the economy? You'd get shot for that in some places. Don't be stupid. Do you know how much money is being circulated? -Over 20 billion dollars. -Exactly. 30 million is nothing. That doesn't work. Why not? Do you think it's easy to steal? Have you done it before? It's not that straightforward. Let me demonstrate it to you. Watch. What are you doing? Take it out! I got caught. See you at the police station. Hey, we should get some help. It will be burned on Tuesday. We only have three days. Where can we find help? Hey, does anyone in your family steal? -Your dad. You always call him a thief. -Your dad. You always call him a thief. Eat. Where can I find a thief? I change my mind. What's up? The prison scares me. I feel like it's made for me. -Come on, someone is coming out. -Don't leave. That's him. Feel his aura. Remember. You're dealing with a big shot now. Show him what you've got. Yes, sir. Let's go. Dude, we need your help with something. Do you have what it takes? What is it? Do you have the chops? Morning, warden. Warden? I'm fainting. So what is it? It's nothing. We were planning to clean up all the beaches in Hong Kong. It's voluntary work. For the good of everyone. We wonder if you could help out. You must have no time for it. Why not introduce some guys to us? Anyway, how many prisoners are set free today? -One. -Thank you. Let's go. Look at him. He's bald. He must have spent a long time in there. He looks like a small-time gangster. He might drag us down. Mark, go check him out. Save it. We have no other choice. Better than nothing. Fatty. Let's go talk to him. Come. What is it, countryman? You still have your accent. That's a dead giveaway. Did you smuggle? You can't make it big without proper identification. Make it big? We would like to share something good with you. -Yes. -No, thanks. I'm finally out, breathing in freedom. Fresh air. I'm reformed. Let's go. We've wasted our time. -And him? -Look for another. The damned Baldy. Shit, it's Big Mouth. Hey, what are you doing? I thought about it. I need to get rich first before I can be clean. Let's get moving. Why are you so scared of the tangerine car? Orange. -Tangerine. -Orange. -Tangerine. -Orange. -It's tangerine. -Who cares what it is. -Orange. -Orange or tangerine, whatever. Stop arguing. We're going to be in trouble! All of us! Who is he? He's an inspector. Shit, he's an inspector. Drive! Miss, you're quite the driver. Did you steal this car? Smart. I did steal the car. I told you to borrow one, not steal one. You said you needed a flashy one. It was a rushed job. Don't go up the slope. Too late. We're already on it. You'll run out of gas. How do you know? Take a look. It's really empty. This will be my new record for being thrown back in jail after being released. -Hey. -It's rolling back. -Pull the hand brake. -Don't! -We're dead this time. -We're dead. I got arrested last time because I stole a car. It ran out of gas, rolled backward and the hand brake failed. Watch out! No, stop! No! Damn you, Baldy! Don't look. Run! Let's go! A car. Mom! -What is it? -Snakes. -I'm afraid of snakes. -Hey, get in. -Get in. -I'll never get in. No! You guys are wimps. Who steals such a junk? -Right. -You should steal a better one. Like that one. I know. We'll lie down on the road. Block the road and stop the car. Then, we'll steal it. Fatty, you go. Otherwise, you'll sit with the snakes. -You go too. -How about you? -I'm going too. -Okay. Miss, you too. -Lie down. -Everyone, lie down. -Lie down. -I will. All together. -Come on. -Come on, lie down. I should be safe here. Get up. -Are you okay? -Are you okay? -Where's the car? -It went past. My legs are numb. Who cares? Get up. You are heartless. -A car's coming. -Get in the van. Just take that piece of junk. Does it run? Hey. You're laughing? What's so funny? Are you guys done laughing? What's the good stuff you're sharing? We don't even know your name. It's too soon to tell you. I was born in a Guan Yu temple. Guan Yu is my godfather, so my surname is Guan. Bullshit. Now you know my name. That's my introduction. You can tell me the secret now. He doesn't look trustworthy. No way, don't tell him. For sure. Unless you can swear in front of your godfather, Guan Yu. It's no use. I don't believe in him. I am actually a Catholic. Okay, I'll give you a chance. Stop when you see a church. I'm done for. What? Are you scared? Get moving. Go! Go on. Hey, look at the sincerity on my face. If I dare lie to you guys, I'll be knocked down dead by a car. Okay? Or I'll choke on a bone and die. I'll get woken up by a ghost. I'll be poisoned by my wife if I get married. If I have kids, my in-laws will kill me. I'll have tumors on my head and sores on my feet. I'll sleep in a coffin while alive and die without a burial ground. I will not get rich before 90 years old. Does that work? Nobody's going to survive that. Now you have to tell me, or else you're going to hell. What's the good stuff about? It concerns three bags of money that are supposed to be burned. Yes, they're at the incinerator. How much? -Thirty million dollars. -Say that again. Thirty million dollars! -Which incinerator? -Tsing Yi Incinerator Station. -Where is the location? -Inside the iron cage on the first floor. Anything else you're not telling me? -No. -No. It's too bad. I'm already reformed. You can't say no now. I need money to do that though. What does that mean? Okay, count me in. Hey, where are you going? To see my lover whom I've not seen in six months. What should I gift her? Money. -Don't be stupid. -Diamond. You're crazy. -Roses. -That's right. Smart girl. I can't wait. Awesome. Hurry up. Hey, I'm not in the car yet. -Maria, look what you've done. -I'm sorry. -What am I going to do? -I'm in a hurry. I have to catch those foxes! Sister Maria. Maria. Maria, perfect timing. This bastard. -He hardly gives me money. Shut up! -I did. He complains that I don't look after the kids. I want a divorce but he said God wouldn't agree. -What now? -I never said anything. -Shut up. I'm talking to her. -Hey. I, Maria, now permit you two to get a divorce. -Effective from tomorrow. -Maria. -Maria! -I'm free! You wish! -Hey. -Hey! Hey! What about us? You can either wait, or else it's a final goodbye. Hey! It's your fault for picking such a guy. Who pricked my back? -Him. -Him. It's okay. I'm used to it. Let's just be honest with one another. You two, go and get the incinerator's blueprint. Once you get it, wait for me at Yao Gei Shipyard at the port. -Sounds good. -That's not possible. Miss, with 30 million dollars, -you can even get a sex reassignment. -That's right. -Okay, no problem. -Really? Fatty, you're in charge of taking me to the incinerator. I want to see if the money is really there. Also, we're going to split the money by 70 percent and 30 percent. You guys get 30 percent and I get 70 percent. Because I'm a professional and you guys are amateurs. Even in football, you'd only be entitled to some travel allowance. I can't believe it. It's true. I only got a travel allowance when I played football. -Go to hell. -Go to hell. Do you want to fight? Come and get it! Fight me! -Baldy, long time no see. Where were you? -I was out at sea. You're back? Baldy, I-- Don't say anything. I already know. -Do you really know? -Yes. I know what to do. -Wait for a while then. -Sure, hurry up. I've been waiting a long time. Baldy. There you are. Come on. Let's do it. What time is it? -Have you been released? -What? I was out at sea. I don't care who you are. Get dressed and scram. -Come on, honey! -I live here. What the hell? Did you move in? I won't hold you to it. You can go out and have a cup of coffee for now. Honey, come on. I'll be done in a minute. -Come on. -Baldy. We've been married for three months. That's right. You lucky bastard. You deserve praise. Baldy. Bye. Are you going out to sea again? Shut up! KINGDOM OF SNAKES That was really quick. A fast shooter! Of course. I'm a professional. Right, no time wasted. -No harm to health. -What? Nothing, I got an idea. Throw the snakes in and pretend to be an animal wrangler, so you'll get to see everything inside. Don't be ridiculous. Sir, how careless you are. Did you crash your car? Mind your own business. Where's Baldy? Over there. Let's get him. Wait, he looks like he's up to something. We'll follow him. I'll drive. Sir, last time you got a girl to look messed up with her clothes. You got Baldy arrested for attempted rape and he was jailed six months. You got your revenge. That bastard cheated my godsister of a diamond ring. I made a vow to arrest him every chance I get. I'll never let him off. Watch and learn. Fatty, drive the car there and wait. Keep the engine running. I told you your stupid idea won't work. -It's too risky. -Fine, just go. FOLLOW THE RULES, DO NOT IGNORE EMPLOYEE'S BENEFITS MONG KOK Back up. He saw us. Stay in the car. I'll check it out. Okay. Still running? Hello. -I recognize you. You're the fox. -Stop! Damn you! Peace be with you. Stop right there, asshole! Get ready to drive! -I'm coming. -Stop! Open the door! Hey! I haven't got in yet! KINGDOM OF SNAKES Don't run! Drive! Stop! I got you. So you've seen the bags of money. It's easy, right? Mom! Snakes! Leave me alone! No! Help me! Somebody, help! Sister, help! Stay calm. I'll save you. Please save me, God! I don't want to die. Snake! That burns! Go away! I don't want God. Let me be. Damn! Swerve! Snakes! Help! Hold me! I can't breathe. I'm about to suffocate. Help! I can't swim. Don't panic. I'll teach you. It's not too late to learn. I'm sinking. Of course you are. You're not doing it right. Who are you? I should be asking you. Why are you in my car? I wonder why too. Get off. What? I'm the police. I'm being chased. Drive. What are you looking at? Drive. Fine. Sit tight. Miss, you're a pretty good driver. Save it. Damn you! You'll have to pay me for the windscreen. You jerk! -You dare scold me? I'll have you-- -Don't run! Don't run if you dare. I'll get you. Damn! Don't fall! Baldy! I'm not Baldy! Stupid afro. Don't let me see you again. It's you again. You again. We're even now. Stop right there. What? You're actually bald. "What? You're actually bald?" Damn you. Stop hitting me. I can't stand people hitting my head. There you go. Thief! -Thief! -What? No, it's nothing. I'll finish you off if you make any more noise. Thief! Baldy. Going in just like that? You're surrounded with bad luck. Get over here. Stand here. I'll dispel all the bad luck. Next time, you'll run faster than they can chase. Hey! There are a few men waiting for you. What's up? Don't ask. You don't have to know. I'll give you a share. What a joke. You've never kept your promise all these years. This is the real deal. -Really? -I just have to move some trash. All ready. Sit. -What now? -All ready. It's a piece of cake. Sit here. Take a look at the blueprint. The best way to get in is through the water pipe. There's a house behind the incinerator. The entrance to the pipe is in the garden. How do you know it's connected? I made this blueprint. How do you know the pipe is clear? My job is to keep the pipes clear. The owner of the house is a designer named Fung. If you want access to the pipes, you'll have to deal with her first. But she's known to be a tough nut to crack. You'll have to put in work. Cigar. Hey, I can smell cigar. Why is there only you? Were you expecting the whole village? What happened to you? Gather around. I kissed a lioness at the zoo. -Nonsense. -Bullshit. Who are they? They're engineers. He took part in the design. Thank you so much. You can leave now. -Leave? What do you mean? -You asked for help. Who's this man? Him? -He drains the pipes. -Go home and sleep. And me? Don't tell me this blind man is leading the way. -No. -No, he heard everything we said. He kept following us. We couldn't ditch him. Great, so we're spreading the money thin. Everybody gets a cut then. Is she here to bring us to heaven? She's my savior. Tell them. The Lord said the three of us are lambs and he's the fox. How dare you badmouth me? God will not forgive you for hitting others. Sister, be mindful of the Lord. Sorry. This is getting too complicated. I'm pulling out. Great! The Lord said we won't go to heaven if we steal. Fatty wants to go to heaven. It's a no go. Do you guys want to go to heaven? Sister, I think I won't go either. Why, Fatty? I don't have friends there. Well then, I'll have to call the police. Thank you, sister. You've shown me the path to righteousness. I thought about what I've done. I'll be honest. I'll repent. Being in prison is tough. Thank you, sister. Have you been in prison? I have. You can touch my butt and feel the scars. Not you. Girl, you can touch. No, thanks. Fine, let's disperse then. Go ahead. We don't need you. Sister, I-- How about you three? I'm destined for poverty. -Let's go. -Don't wait around for the police. Where are you going? Don't be so rough. I'm not worried about those three lambs. As for you, you'll stay within my sight for three days. I'll follow you wherever you go. -You! No! -You dare? Hey, good job. That was pretty smart. Where did you find a nun to control Baldy? What's wrong with Baldy? We'll handle it ourselves. Handle what? Let's get the blueprint. What's the blueprint for? Baldy. When did you accept Lord Jesus? Sister, let me talk to my friend here. I'm still within your sight. -You don't have to follow me. -Okay. Remember what you told me to do when someone is blocking you to your road to riches? Get rid of them. Help me get rid of her then. Don't be stupid. I don't hit women. What if there's 30 million dollars to be split between the both of us? -How much? -Thirty million dollars. Hold me. I feel dizzy. -Must I hit her? -No. Just lock her up for three days. It's like taking care of a cat. It's easy. Sister, do you like fish? No, I don't like bones. Get her lots of fish and let her choke. -How much is it again? -Thirty million dollars. -Let's run! -Hey, you! Here. -Got her. -Let's go. All done. Where's Baldy? My goodness. What happened? My goodness. Help me. This is not good for my bones. Let go. Fine, I will. You're such an idiot. Why did you tell her to let go? Quick, put me down. Gently. Come on. This will work. Use this. She's incredible. -Take this. -What? Attack her. No, I don't hit women in front of Guan Yu. She's not a woman. She's a nun. -A nun is untouchable. -Okay. Don't take me as a nun. Come on. Come. Damn woman. How dare you provoke me? I'll show you. Leung, show her your Hammer Punch. Use that. Go. Hey. That was amazing. The 30 million dollars is more amazing. You're right. It's okay to be maimed for that fortune. Get her! How embarrassing. I wasn't ready. Hey, you can't leave yet. Get him. My back. Hey, don't die on me yet. Don't faint either. Tell me. Tell me where the money is. Tell me! I'll tell you if you beat her. Go to hell. -Light this. -Remove the cigar. Where's the money? The cigar got lighted. How could you be so brutal? Are you really a nun? I think you're better off as a garbage lady. You'll forever be a spinster. I dare you to curse some more. I'll electrocute you. You dare? I'll electrocute you to death. I won't do it again. -Stop. -Die. I won't do it again. It feels so nice, dumb old woman. Someone is running away. You kicked me twice. So what? You're dead meat. He hit a woman. I did not. My back. I'll kill you both. Damned Baldy, keep me out of your shit. Hey. I'll show you! My head. Damn! There are so many stars. Where? Look at how big and beautiful Hong Kong is. And yet, not an inch belongs to me. What do you think, sister? God is fair and just. Heaven is even bigger and more beautiful. Stop, I'm not ready to go there. Save your breath. Okay, let's do it on our own. -Cheers! -Cheers! Wait a minute. I don't want to be labeled a traitor. Don't be stupid. We can just give them their share when it's done. Right, that shows our gratitude. How much should we give them? Ten thousand each. -Are you sure? -What? Are you rich now? If not, how much? Ten thousand for all of them. That satisfies my conscience too. -Come on! -Here, let's drink. So cold. What's the matter? It was really cold last night. I didn't want you to catch a cold. You're too nice. Thank you. Praise and glory to God. But something doesn't feel right. Sister. I've thought about it. I'm not going to do it. But my friends know what's up. I want to try to stop them. Will you come along? Of course. But I can't, with the suit I'm wearing. Give me some money, so I can get a better outfit. How about your gold watch and necklace? They're all fake. Come on. All right. YAO GEI SHIPYARD Wait for me. SAN HING PAWNSHOP My late wife. I wish to print a few more as souvenirs. Wait for me. PHOTOCOPY, LAMINATING SUDDENLY... -Want to copy? -Two dozen, please. -I'll get them later. -Okay. Hello. Looking to have a good time? I have rooms too. Hey Pimp Tak, this is Baldy. -Wrong number. -Hey! Don't hang up! I'm not asking to borrow money. I have a pretty lady to sell to you. How is the market? You were never in this business. How do you get such good stuff? I've changed. After spending six months in jail, I've come up with a new idea. You'll be amazed by this breakthrough. What kind of breakthrough? It's good stuff. The world is all about looks and packaging. I'll wrap her nicely from head to toe. Is she pretty? Prettier than Brigitte Lin. Are you sure? Does she have a nice figure? Hello? Incredible, just like an ape. What? Don't worry about it. Just get your regular customers to come and check it out. -That's all then. -Don't be late. Coming. What took you so long? So many people. The more people, the more money. -Be careful. -I know what to do. Gentlemen, I know you all need me. -Yes, we do. -Wait, hang on. -Take a seat. -I'll talk to them first. Why don't you wait inside? -Okay. -Take her inside. -Hey. -No need to rush. Come in and get ready. One thousand dollars. Girls, I'm calling the police. They're shooting pornography upstairs. Let's go. Hello, police? I'm getting a ticket. -Did you assault the police? -No! I'm calling the police. People are shooting pornography upstairs. A nun is being victimized. It's at Lok Yuen Villa. She's being harassed by two policemen. -What are you saying? -You guys can explain it better. Do it. -Watch what you're saying. -Hey, stop! -Stop right there! -I'm not leaving. I'll wait in the car. Who is it? Coming. It's you. Fung, open the door. I bring you good fortune. -What? -Come in. Come in if you dare. This was an expensive vase. This is expensive too. -This is more expensive. -I don't care. Catch it. -Catch this too. -Don't! -You're so slow. -Damn you. I'm calling the police. This is for the broken windscreen. One thousand dollars. I spent the whole night to earn this. I hope you'll accept it and forget it. How despicable I am. Since meeting you, I've been thinking about you. I yearn to be with you. I sincerely wish to know you better. Get into your room and do what I wish to do. Once you get a taste of me, you'll be on cloud nine. How clumsy of me. Where did I get these photos? Almost. Here it is. "Cloud nine"? I kick it. I kick it. Headbutt. You're incredible. Stop throwing things. Hear me out first. There's 30 million to be made. We'll split the bounty. You get one million. How about it? Do I get that little? To hell with you. I'm dying. Don't die yet. -I'm dying. -Are you okay? You should've said so sooner. Anything can be discussed with 30 million dollars. I didn't expect you to be so tough. I wouldn't have to share if I get rid of you. What? It's here. -Hey, go in. -Sure. Hey. Make sure we deal with that woman properly. Sure. Look. If she's of the right mind, I'll handle it. If she's crazy, Fatty will do it. If she prefers women, Tomboy can do it. Where's Tomboy? -Hey. -Let it go. This concerns 30 million. I know you're not interested in girls. But for the 30 million dollars, you have to do it. -Come on. -Come on. That's better. Just go with the plan. -Baldy is here too. -Baldy is here too. Remember to have these things ready. How much do I get? -How much did I say just now? -Ten million dollars. -Did I say that? -Yes. Fine, whatever. Make me some coffee. Deal. -I want it with milk and sugar. -Okay. Ten million dollars, I'm rich. I'm getting it this time. Finally, things are looking up. I feel good. So good. Why did you undress? I want to undress you too. Come on. What? Just come over here and you'll know what I'm going to do. You have one minute to put your clothes back on. Or I'm getting someone to castrate you. Damn. Keep quiet. No, it's all over. Forget it. He got her. He's getting dressed already. Shut up. I'm thinking of what to do. Aren't we friends? Fine, sorry. It's Big Mouth. Hey, Baldy! Run, quick! The inspector is here. I'm going. Hurry up. Bye! Hey, what is going on? Hey! What are you doing? Get in. You three bastards again. What did you do this time? Did you rob a gold shop? -No. -Then what? We were busted for attempting to use dirty money to buy sex. -What does that mean? -Just be straight and say you paid for prostitution. Hey, are you the inspector? Yes, sister. No need to be so rude. It's required for the job. Sir, we haven't found Baldy. Let me out! Let me out! Where am I? Hey! Over here. Okay. Hey, no! -Stay inside. -Close the door. There you go. Sorry for the trouble. Stay there for one night. We'll handle it ourselves. We'd rather not have you mess it up. After we succeed, we'll give you a share. We won't save it all for ourselves like you. -He can't hear us. -Right. -You speak, you act it out. -Okay. Sorry for locking you up. We didn't want to do it. You were going to ditch us. You have no loyalty. You made this matter... Jump. More complicated than it has to be. You jerks! I want to beat you to death. Don't run! Look. What's happening? Damn! I can't open it. -It won't open? -It's turning. Yes, it is. There's water and it's turning. He'll die in it! How long is this going to be? -Five minutes for a dishcloth. -He's so dirty. Would it take at least a week? -What now? Baldy. -This is bad. It won't stop turning. He is going to die. -It stopped. -It stopped. No, it's going the other way. -It's going! -He is going to die. Are you okay, Baldy? -What to do now? -Poor Baldy. This is bad. Do something. I'll take a chance. -It stopped! -It stopped. Careful. Help him to sit there. No, it's okay. You don't have to hold me. Wait, the whole place is turning. -It's turning. -Hey. You better sit down. I'm so sorry, Baldy. -We didn't mean to. -Go away. -Leave me alone. -Hey. You got your brain washed in there, so you know you did wrong. You shouldn't have been so cunning. Cunning? Why is it cunning to go after my dream? Don't you have dreams? Which school did you graduate from? I have a dream. Look. -What's that? -What's that? It's Hawaii. I'm not asking for much. When I was 20 years old, I decided to make enough money to go to Hawaii and enjoy life. -That doesn't mean you can hog the money. -What? Do you call the First Soldier greedy? -What's First Soldier? -What's First Soldier? -It means-- -You don't even know that? Did you even go to school? Listen up. You are the future of the country and the pillar of society. You shouldn't be stealing. Leave the stealing to people like me. Did I say that I wouldn't split the money with you? -You did. -I'm not talking to you. Miss, you're understanding. You tell them, did I say it? -You did. -What a bitch. You say it. Yes or no? Did I say I wouldn't give you guys your share? I will break your neck if you say yes. -Did I? -No. See? I told you I never said it. Good boy. Wait, the gold on my chain has faded. The glass has cracked. The jade is gone. Are you happy now? Damn. Even the watch dial is gone. Hey, I'll help you look for it. Your clothes have shrunk. Your clothes are wet. I hope you don't catch a cold. Such a thoughtful girl. Hey, help me search. What are you looking at? Do you think he'll slip away? What? Trying to hog everything by himself. Don't be so skeptical. Men are kind by nature. Him? Kind by nature? People will change, right? Hey, come over here. -See? -He's a good guy. Come, let me show you something. -Your watch dial. -Thanks. So sorry, Baldy. -It's okay. -Baldy. I'm sorry too. Don't mention it. -What's in here? -It's in there. Go in. -Yes. -There's nothing. -Hey. -What are you doing? Spend the night here, kids. Don't mess with my plan. Cunning bastard! -Jerk! -Rogue! -Villain! -Crook! -Maka! -Who's Maka? Whatever. You guys are too naive. Nobody is a saint. There are only big crooks, small crooks, serious crimes, petty crimes. I had no choice but to be a crook. I didn't get fed as a kid, so I found milk from elsewhere. In school, the teacher wanted me expelled. So I forced him to join the underworld. When someone gets in my way, I'll take everything they have. Where's the other guy? -Please continue. -Right. Talking about being cunning, I'm not cunning at all. You don't win by being cunning, you need to be ruthless! Not just a little bit. A whole lot of ruthlessness! As they say, a bit of wicked rules the country. Wicked ruthlessness conquers the world! Sometimes, being ruthless doesn't work. Let me get you guys out. I don't have the key. -Shit! -Baldy. Hey, don't close the grilles! -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Hey, don't just say bye. You have no humor. I was just joking. Shit. Wait. We'll grab the things. Fatty, you be the diversion. -I'm dealing with her dad? -Yes. He hates you the most. You have to do it. Go on. Get on with it. You'll be fine. Jerk. Douchebag. I'll kick you as I like. Come and get me if you dare. Who are you? Why did you kick me? Sorry, wrong person. Stop! Are these things worth a couple of thousands of dollars? Of course, but you need to give my dad ten percent. What? -Ten percent of 30 million dollars is-- -Three million dollars! Will you give him? If not, I'm taking these back. Fine, okay. He'll get a share. Let's go. Dad! We'll save three million for you. What? Give me three million dollars? Three million dollars? Hey. No. She's blocking the entrance. We can't get down. Hey! Get her attention. -What? Me again? -You can do it. It's for 30 million dollars. -Thirty million dollars, right? -Go on. Who is it? It's Baldy. I'm going to be rich. Hello, how are you? Red bean is cold, green bean is cold Eat them all and your butt becomes cold -Security. -Hello, Mr. Wong? I'm not Wong. I'm Cheung. Doesn't matter. I saw something strange just now. Hurry up. We'll be exposed when she's done with the call. She will need some time to explain. Hey, she has them too? You're right. I never noticed. She looks more womanly now. -What? -Let me look some more. Hurry up! It concerns 30 million dollars! Right, that's more important. We'll get better ones. Yes, it sure sounds unbelievable. Never mind. You won't believe me anyway. Just do it. It's not wet. Hey. You scared me. Come inside. I saw something strange just now. Listen. Forget it. You won't believe it. So what's the plan? Save the talk. We'll move out right away. -You prepared everything? -All done. Good job. Let me give you a kiss. No way. Not before getting the money. -What's that? -We're thieves, right? -In that outfit? -Yes, I designed it myself. You're crazy. No! I bet they're up to no good. Do something. Sister, let's put an end to this matter. What? You've done your best to help those lambs. Let me do the rest of the work. No, I need to finish the job. -This is the duty of the police. -No. This the duty of God. PLEASE SHOW SOLICITUDE FOR THE EMPLOYEE Hey, Wong.

It adds up. Yes, I'm pregnant. -Tell them. -What? -She's carrying our baby too. -She has my baby. Go to hell! No need to ruin our friendship over this much money. Right, you guys will be on the losing end. No need to be shy. Yes, you can decide. -You're the boss. -Yes. We were just following orders. Good. That's the way it should be. Hey, there's another man. Another parasite? -Long time no see. -Hey, what a coincidence. -They're stealing stuff. -Give it to me. You dare to leave me out of such a big deal? Thankfully, Sister Maria tipped me off. If not, you guys would've hit the jackpot for no reason. Hey, who's that? No idea. I told him. I didn't want you three innocent lambs to be deceived by the fox. You sold me off! Damn fox! -Stop. -Do you want to fight? -Stop it. -Jerk! Maria. I don't want you guys to become criminals like him. It's up to you now. Be the voice of reason. Go on. He's the bad guy. He wants to take everything. Do you want to die? You jerk. You threw me under the bus. Hey, stay here. I'll call for backup. -Okay. -No. He'll kill me if you leave. No, stop! -Shut up. -I won't shut up. I told you he's the bad guy. I'll shoot you if you guys won't cooperate. Go on. I've dedicated myself to the Lord. I am prepared to die. You don't scare me. Shoot. If you dare. We'll jump on you if you shoot. We can overpower you. Yes, he's a big man. He can take all six bullets. Yes, we're not scared of you. I didn't say anything. Is that against the law? Bewitch him. Hey, who is he? -An inspector. -Hello, sir. There are six bags of money. There's more than enough for us. You can choose any three bags. They might contain the real stuff. Shut up, pretty woman. "Pretty woman"? -See? He called me pretty. -He's blind. Hurry. Don't move. If you don't bring the money here, I'm going to shoot him in the head. No, please don't. Don't do it. I'm dead. Let's watch a bit longer. Yes, let's watch him fall. He deserves it for lying to us. I'm counting to three. One. Two. Hey, I'm coming out. Stop hitting him. And the other three? Three! -Wait! -Fine, we'll come. Let's go. Open the bags! -I said, open them! -Wait. No need to shout. I'll do it. Open it. Why? Damn you! You tricked me again. Not me. Him. It's your fault. -You dare trick me? -Help! -Help! -All this trouble. -Don't hit him. -I'll kill you! Stop it. Thank the Lord. It's all a misunderstanding. Nobody here did anything wrong. The road ahead is still bright and clear. Why don't you all leave this evil place with me? -Yes, sure. -Yes, sure. Not so fast, Fatty! -Did the 30 million actually exist? -Yes or no? -It does, really. -Where is it? -Tell us. -Spit it out. -Let me go, everyone. -Since you're not sinners... I swear. If I lie to you, my whole family... -Say it. -Say it. Will have AIDS. Get up. -Who took it? -Who took it? You people are hopeless. I know what happened. -Who did it? What? -Who? Bye, poverty.
