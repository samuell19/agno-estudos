This story is fiction based on a true story. Directed by Yôichi Sai WHERE IS THE MOON? Company Precept: "Think and come up with ideas." "If you can't think, work till you sweat." “If you can't think or work, piss off. “ - By Yoichi Kaneda. - No. Seichi. Listen. Take your work seriously. Yes, sir. - Throw away your pride. - Yes. Let your mind go blank. - Understand? - Yes. Hey! Are you new? I am honoured to join you. My name is Mitsuru Anbo. Pleased to meet you. When does the Defence Force start its New Year? - Pardon? - Like yakuza, you know. They celebrate it on 13 December. I'm afraid I know little about gangsters. Hopeless. No good. When I won a gold medal in the bantam class The guy who I KO'd died four days later in the hospital. That's when I gave up on becoming a pro. He tells me in my dreams I should go for the world. Then go for the world. Can you lend me some money, Chun? Good morning. Hachi! Me not Hachi. Me Hassan. - Have you taken my money? - No. I counted and counted. I'm short. It's unfair of you to suspect Hassan. Siding with him, eh? We shouldn't discriminate against someone of a different race. Japan's becoming a multiracial country... Did you read that in your porn magazine? Let's go, Kanda. Idiot. Shut up! Give me a cigarette. Watch your manners. We're just old classmates today. The bride and groom! Give them a warm welcome. We're young. North-South isn't our problem, is it? - Meaning? - Was your school near Fuji TV? - The Korean School? - I often go there for work. Are you in the industry? Well... yes. I suppose I am. - I go to Asia University. - I'm impressed! Banks won't give the nod in this climate. Anyway, any profit goes to the Japanese. Our People's Finance Group can't even stand on its own. They'd sell their school... and pocket the money. Our country can't be united without mutual understanding. The scent of your hair turns me on. You're not asking for sex by any chance, are you? You're blunt, aren't you? Did you think you had a chance? I don't think I'm far off target. Go buy a whore somewhere. I'll pay. These gentlemen played baseball together in their days at the Tokyo Korean High School. Your attention, please. In this group behind me there are two bachelors. That ex-junkman tried to get into the golf business. But he's got a good business selling discount skis. You don't understand, Sell. He wanted status, you see. "The Happiest People Alive"... More applause, please. The sky is blue, our hearts are gay. Play your accordions. We are proud of our country where people live in harmony. Our great leader Kim II-Sung... Why only North Korean songs? It's an order from above. Why not ask our group leader to sing a song? There's no time. - You won't let him sing? - It's not that. We won't accept this. You're discriminating against South Korea. His money dried up after 18 holes. He can barely pay the interest. 30 our boss stepped in. How can Koreans work with the right-wingers? It's give-and-take. Money can bend principles. When we're in trouble, Japan's behind us. I can only borrow 600-700 million on my land. It's a bargain. A golf course for 2. 5 billion... This is your chance to seize destiny. Destiny... The boss will take care of that guy and we'll combine your brains and our power. What about the money? Why do you think I'm in finance? We can't talk on the phone. Let's sit down. My conviction is that the couple makes the family, the family makes the nation and the nation creates the age. Let me sing. Come on, let him sing. But, sir... Do they teach sex at the North School? Don't the students demand it? I want to be a student. Go back to primary school. The leader of the Nakaya South Korean community, Mr Son Chul-Yu, will sing for the couple. A famous South Korean song 'Willow Trees along the River... Let's enjoy it. Hello, Tadao. How's business? When I ask "How's business?" you say "It's so-so." It's so-so. Good morning. Good morning, Mama. Look at this big boy getting pocket money from his mum. It's called appreciation, a Japanese custom. You Filipinos wouldn't understand. Who's that? Connie. Her Japanese is good so I hired her to assist me. But she's such a tart! Bye. Sorry, I won again. I've won more than I want. Your luck's run out. Look, I've got the whole lot! - You plucked my last feather. - Grow it back. Can you grow it back? Hello. Kaneda Taxis. Oh, it's you. Where am I, sir? Mr Anbo, where is the moon? It's in the east... or in the west... or the south... or maybe the north. Mr Anbo, just drive towards the moon. Good evening. - Why aren't you up? - I have a headache. - Don't use my futon. - Mine's dirty. You bastard. - Doesn't that hurt your eye? - My head's pounding. When I dream, I feel so sad that I can't move my body. I don't know why. Do you, Chun? Stop complaining and go to hospital. You know I've no money. And it makes no difference where I am. - I'm tired of hearing that. - Chun... Give me a cigarette. I like you, Chun. But I hate Koreans. I'm tired of that too. Koreans are cunning, dirty and uncultured. You're just like a Korean yourself. No way! I'm pure Japanese. - Chun... - What? Can you lend me some money? I'm the madam's son. - How's business? - It's so-so. Be quiet! Sir... Just between you and me, this place is a rip-off. You know, Connie... my heart is full of sadness. I want someone... to heal my heart. Do you want a drink? Sol drown my loneliness in drink again. By the end of the month? Well, I'm not sure. Do they need cash? I check the tachograph every day. It can't be wrong. Anyone can make a mistake. I don't make three mistakes in a row. Never mind. I know it's a chance for a bargain. Listen, Mr Ono. Why do tachographs record time, distance and speed? For the safety of the drivers. If they're not overworked or driving too fast... If they're not being lazy or embezzling the takings... In other words, tachographs are there to tie us down. Hey, lend me some money? Don't, Anbo. You'd be throwing it down the drain. I'll repay it straight away. - Aren't you ashamed? - Of what? - Of sponging off a junior. - Don't talk, you crook. I work harder than you. You always cause trouble. Don't talk, you drain. I'm not a drain. Are you picking a fight? Will you two quarrel outside? Excuse me, sirs. Your hair's a mess. Work hard, all right? The Korean School spirit, eh? You know I trust you. Bye. Will you at least work your quota? 200 km a day is nothing compared to other companies. Moving 100 million yen with one phone call isn't like making 400,000 yen driving a taxi. Chun... A taxi driver earns from mileage. Stop whining and do your job. Run, Hoso, or you'll be in trouble. How's this, sir'? Happy now? Irene... When you finish with clients, you must come back at once. Translate, Connie. Irene, pull your socks up. Use your brains. You're in Japan, so adapt to Japanese ways. Translate. Follow their system. Why? I'm a Filipina. Not a bow-legged Jap. Lolita... Don't waste your time chatting. Make sure you offer drinks. Japanese men will always order drinks if you ask. Japan is a country of gentlemen. We make our money on drinks. The more we make, the more your salary goes up. Money is everything. Understand? Translate, Connie. I'm not an interpreter, Mama. Money buys a house back home and makes your family happy. Well, Connie? So don't make a fuss if a client touches you. I get paid for singing songs and pouring drinks but I don't get paid for anything else. Who do you think made you a manageress? I don't have to sell my body like others do. I came to Japan when I was 15. I came to Japan when I was 10! You can't fool me. Don't you think you should open the hen? While you're lecturing us you're losing customers. I've gone through everything you've gone through. You should look up to me as a role model. If you do as I say, you'll never go wrong. Translate, Connie. She made lots of mistakes. That's how she learned. I think in Japan people like you aren't treated fairly. You're discriminated against. I think I can understand you very well. - Are you coming on to me? - No, Connie. I'm a very serious man... so serious as to be idiotic. Idiotic? - Pure. - Pure? Pure, eh? A long time ago, there was a big war. People of my country were enslaved like cattle. My mother, like you now, came to Japan to earn a living for the family. She crossed the wild seas... Did she swim? In a boat. I don't know how she was before, but now she's rich. She's gone through a lot. My father was killed by the Japanese Army and all my brothers died. How? From malnutrition. Only I survived. My mother worked like a dog. As for me... I had to spend my nights alone at home. It's embarrassing for a man of over 30 to say this... but I'm starving for love. Good night. Connie... What? Platonic love is lonely, isn't it? I only screw men I love. Be honest with yourself. Does being honest mean I have to screw you? I love you, Connie. I love you. I love you. I felt your tongue. Oh, well... why not? What? A kiss. Come off it. One night, that was all. - Shit! I forgot something. - We're already late. Give me the key. Welcome home. I've run you a bath. What's this? My stuff. I'm unpacking it. Get out! Go and have a bath, then we'll talk. - Talk about what? - Don't get mad. - I'll call the police. - What will you say? "Do you know him?" "He's my boss's son." "Have you lost anything?" "I have more stuff now." Stop this nonsense. Connie... Why are you doing this? I need you. Connie... I don't need you. Have a bath while it's hot. It's my bath! The pitcher's first ball... The batter hits it. It's big... Big... Connie! Look, Connie. It's big... - Hello. - Good morning! God be with me. Hello. Yes, that's right. - Chun's there, isn't he? - Chun? Tadao Kanda. You know, Chun for short. - Hello. - It's me. - Hello, Hoso. - I always wanted to ask... Why are you Korean? Why is your Japanese better than mine? Hoso, this isn't a kids' counselling service. Pervert. - Hello. - Is Chun there? What? I don't like Koreans, but I like you. - So? - Lend me some money. Connie, darling... Get me Chun. For you. - What do you want? - Don't leave me! - Are you stupid? - I told you I like you. How many times do I have to tell you? Hoso... Don't call me again. Connie... The fire's out. Stop this shit, Hoso! Tadao? What are you doing there, Tadao? - Is Sell in? - Mr Arai... - Kang Su... - Hello. Chun Nam. Hey... won't you work for me? I'll pay you a good salary. I don't like money-lenders. We Koreans in Japan... have to make money for as long as we're here. We must all get stronger and pull together. Don't lecture me. Koreans just don't have a spirit of self-sacrifice. What I want is to use the money I make from lending for the unification of Korea. The money I make belongs not to me but to society. Koreans only think about themselves and their relatives. That's the bad side of capitalism. To end our people's tragedy and build a unified nation I'm prepared to lose all my money. Believe me! So says the guy who got VD from a whore. "“Oh, my dick hurts..." You betrayer of the nation. After the golf course, I'd like a hotel. To accommodate 2000 people. It's good to plan ahead. That old fool couldn't see beyond a pinball parlour. We're a new generation of Korean businessmen in Japan. We're the children of capitalism. Damn unification! - Mr Arai... - I'm sorry. That was a private matter. When you deal with Mr Konno, talk to me first, okay? I know. I ask for your generous assistance. Let's have a meal with our president again. We learn so much from him, you know. Hey! Wake up. To Ikebukuro. Come on, wake up. Open the door, you bastard. - I want to fuck her. - It's not for hire. No. No... Go on, get him. Kick him! I don't like scolding. It's not my style. But how can a taxi driver raise his hand to customers? Some customers they were. They're demanding compensation. They stink, you know. The authorities will come down on us if we refuse customers. You can't drive a taxi and be scared of the authorities. Don't you know that drivers can't argue back? They provoked me. Osamu... If you hit them, you lose. Endure all the blows, and you'll win. They were savages. Don't be racist. Say "white native South Americans". Savages are savages. Hello. Kaneda Taxis. It's Anbo here, sir. Where am I? What do you see around you, Mr Anbo? I see a golden object that looks like a turd. Turn right at the turd and drive straight. You can all bloody well... Good morning. What's happened? My wife's run away. Mr Senba, I'm taking a few days off. What are you saying? - Who is it? - It's me. I know Chun's there. He's mad. Let me in, Chun. I'm not here. - He's not here. - Liar! I saw him go in. - The neighbours will be angry. - He'll give up. Let me in, Chun! - Who are you? - Shut up! What have you got to do with my man? I look after Chun. - Chun! - What do you want? - Are you jealous? - You're a lunatic. I came to see Chun. You get out of my way. Hello. Go home, will you? Are you angry with me, Chun? I don't like Koreans... but I like you. Hoso... Tell him to go home. He's not a bad guy. - Shall I kick you both out? - Go home! I slept in Chun's bed. What are you saying, you idiot? We're tied together by a strong friendship. Don't worry, Connie. Get out! What's your name? You're dark, aren't you? Mum... Stop sulking. You're like a child. I borrowed this video for you. I always think of you more than anyone else. Whenever you're being sweet, there's always something... - Shall we pack the video too? - Don't be stupid. I'd gladly send you to the North. How are my brothers? Some brother you are! I think I want to live in a warm climate. Could you face your brothers without shame? Yes. You can have fun with Connie. But if you tell me you want to marry her I'll disown you. No Japanese girls... no Filipinas... no Cheju Islanders... no Southern girls... Who can I marry, then? Heaven help me! Done. Pack them. People's Democratic Republic of Korea in the light of factors of an economic nature or a political nature or the benefits provided By the Japanese economy. But at the moment many of these conditions can hardly be improved upon. And yet we can see so much hardship. And in these circumstances it's very hard to maintain our faith in religion. I wonder how people see us. Two young lovers. - You'd be the pimp. - Are you picking a fight? I have an eye for men. - I do love you. - You're so shameless! I love you. - How do you know that? - I'm learning. What else? Let's fuck. You'll be punished one day. Let's go to hell together. Get out. Come on, get out. Show me your ID and licence. He broke my tooth! Quick, the handcuffs! See how he returned my kindness? There are plenty of other Iranians. I agree, sir. Out with all rogue foreigners! - I agree, sir. - They should go home. I agree... Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to interrupt, but the bank rang. Mr Arai has passed a dud cheque and gone on the run. The bloody idiot! Where's our pay? I'm going to quit. For my little angel's sake, I'll quit driving. Our president is trying hard to raise some money. I won't work until you pay me. I won't work for nothing. I'll quit... definitely. We will pay you. By the way... What happened to our recreation trip? Haven't we saved for it? We're hard up now. We're supposed to have lots of fun with geisha girls. That's right. I remember. Can't we still go, and make it Tada's farewell? Sure. Let's go. Here are the keys to your cars, sir. Fine. 305,000 yen received, sir. Please wait. How was the spa? Was it good? The geisha girls were so old we got a shock. The bill shows you had fun. I wouldn't mind staying another night. Now that you've had your fun, we must help each other to get through this crisis. Can we stop for some milk on the way? Hey! Aren't you aware of the state our company is in? It's been a good trip, hasn't it? We'll be back! Thanks a lot. We Koreans should help each other. What for? I'm only your employee. You're all fired! Now is the time for us to work together across national and racial borders. We must look to the future and work as hard as we can. Effort in business! Only effort in business will save the world. We're like a family. Think of me as your real mother and work harder. But we're only humble guest workers. That's what's wrong with South-East Asian women. Filipino, Thai, Malaysian, Taiwanese, Chinese... Chinese are the least trustworthy. Isn't Korea in South-East Asia? It's in East Asia! Oh well, too bad... Why don't the two of us pool our efforts tonight? Mama too can devote herself to saving the world. Whether you're on a short date or an overnight stay I'll keep shop for you. Don't you know how hard I work for you? Stop it, Mother. You're an embarrassment So what? The reason I have this place and all is because I've done embarrassing things. I can see that, Mama. Shut up! You've brought nothing but trouble. - Don't blame me. - It's not her fault, Mother. Don't you ever sympathise with your poor mother? You should be on my side. Come on, cut it out. Why shouldn't I rely on my own son? You know, I'm going to quit that rotten company. I want to become an independent cab driver. You got a ticket for speeding the other day. You have to have a clean record for 10 years. - Have I ever had an accident? - I'm talking about offences. I can become independent any time I like. And... I'll bring my mother out from Niigata. My son, too. I'll start a new life with my ex-wife. - You should quit driving taxis. - I'll build a house. I'll get my family together. My ex-wife's working at a club in Ginza. She rang me the other day and said she wanted to come back to me. - Where did she ring you? - In my apartment. Will you lend me money, Chun? Let's go and see her. - Where's the club? - Somewhere around here. Perhaps I got it wrong. It may be in Tachikawa, not Ginza. How can you mix up Gina They're similar, aren't they? Hoso... Slow down. Don't worry. I can easily handle 100 or 200 kph. I know your left eye is rather weak. And so is my right ear. My head is aching badly. It feels like it's burning inside. I'll do it, damn it. I'll stake my life. Why should I be knocked down? I'll knock him down. Damn it... Let's go home. We both have to work tomorrow. You think I'm telling you a lie, don't you? - That's not true. - Yes. You think I'm lying. You look down on me. I don't like that. Let's cool ourselves down. I don't like Koreans looking down on me. - Let's go home. - Shut up! I'm going to see my ex-wife. She rang me. You don't have a phone. She wanted to see me. She was crying. She wants our family together. I understand. Get out. I hate Koreans. Yes. Thank you very much, sir. - Any radio message yet? - They're trying to call him. Wouldn't it be quicker to call the police? Body temperature... Someone's life is at risk, you know. Same here. He may have been killed. He's stupid. He should at least contact us. He couldn't call us from the bottom of a dam. Are you enjoying this? I'm worried. - He may be asleep. - Then someone would see him! Please don't shout. What if my angel has a fit? Weren't you going to quit for your angel's sake? I'm here until I find another job. You were with him last, weren't you? I'll report it to the police. I can't take responsibility. Who cares about responsibility now in this company? Hello. Kaneda Taxis. This is Anbo, sir. Where am I... Look, Connie. It's a little far from here... Make it strong. But it's a very nice club. How far is it? - Shiojiri in Nagano. - Nagano? My friend owns it. I told him about you and he's very keen. Eat some, Tadao, before it dries up. The manager's young and energetic. I left the tuna belly for you. You can see snow there. Cut it out. I don't want to see snow. Filipinos hate snow. Are you so keen to separate us? You don't have to take the job. Enough is enough. Let's go to the Philippines, Tadao. What's this about? We're going to live together in the Philippines. He wouldn't go and leave me behind. He said he was sick of you. There's a Japanese saying, "Blood is thicker than water." Isn't it "Money's thicker than water"? Don't, Connie. Tadao, you have to choose. Me or this old bitch. You little tart! Go back to the Philippines. - Does it hurt? - I'm not a nut case. I've got a headache, that's all. The cops are threatening to send me to the hospital. They say I might not come out. I just wanted to see Mother. I didn't know she was dead. It was my fault that I didn't know but I wanted to see her, that's all. I'm not a lunatic, am I, Chun? No. You won't put me in the hospital, will you? I couldn't put you in the hospital. So don't worry. I like you, though I don't like Koreans. I know. You'll come to see me again? Yes. I'll come again. I'm a poor man. It makes no difference where I live. Chun... Can you lend me some money? You have some forms to fill in. Where are you going? Cigarettes. In the drawer. So we still have some... Here they are. - I want some beer. - Shall I go and buy some? It's in the fridge. What's that for? You're really disgusting. What have I done? Lies, lies! Always telling lies. Have I lied to you? Your father was killed by the Japanese and your brothers died of malnutrition? What a story! There were people like that. Stop it! Stop it, Connie. Don't waste food. You'll never find a woman as lovable as me. You're so modest. - I wish you'd drop dead! - Life's hard enough. Bastard! Stop it. Idiot! - You sex maniac. - Suck her sagging tits! After all I've done for you! - When did you do what? - I worried so much over you. - Come to the Philippines. - No, I won't. - Don't come, then. - I said I won't. Come! I've had enough of you. Come to the Philippines! Hey, I know that character. It's in the word "ginger". Is your name pronounced "Ga"? It's Kang, sir. - Are you from China? - I'm Korean. So, you're a South Korean immigrant in Japan, right? I have lots of Korean friends like you. They live in a ghetto... A place where there are many Korean immigrants. I can't remember my friend's name. - Isn't he Mr Kim? - Like the one on TV? I visited him once. Their apple tasted like their pickles. Everything they had smelt of pickles. Do you still hate our pickles? I absolutely love them. I buy jars of them. I'm fussy about Korean barbecue. Their grandmother kept talking to us in Korean but my poor friend couldn't speak the language. She should speak in Japanese if she's in Japan. - Do you think so, too? - Of course. You know... the Korean comfort women issue is a bit odd, isn't it? "What's the “comfort women" issue? Weren't they prostitutes? And it was during the war. It was before we were born. We don't care, do we? I was born after the war, too. But we say "after the liberation". I've been following Korean issues. That riot in I. was incredible. They just shoot, don't they? It's scary, isn't it? You know what they call “Korean power“... I wish I had some of their power. Me too. Maybe I should go to Seoul. I'd like to come with you. You could show me around. Oh... I'm short of money. Would you mind waiting? It's just there. I won't be long. I'll be back. Police! You bastard! I'll call the police! I'm sorry. Forgive me. Don't hit me, Mr Ga! - Kang is my name. - I won't do it again, Mr Ga! I said my name was Kang. I'm sorry, Mr Kang. - Pay your fare. - Yes! - It was a joke. - The money! I really didn't mean it. Your change of 1390 yen, sir. Thank you very much, sir. At the present moment many of us cannot escape from our own beliefs. There are times when we see the ills in God's world and want to change direction... Connie... I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hit you. Not now. I want to say this to you before God. Can't you be quiet? I love you, Connie. Go to hell. The sunset over Manila Bay viewed from Rizal Park... must be very beautiful. Will you run a karaoke bar for me? Then... we'll build a house... and live with my family. Will you live in the Philippines until you die? Your lies... have affected me a bit this time. I'm not lying. I can't take it any more. I love you, Connie. I'm sick and tired of hearing that. There's nothing we can do. We can't escape. They won't kill us but we'll be their slaves. But times will change for us. After all, capitalism is all about money. Until then, imagine you're in the North and work hard. What happened to our Japanese support? We've been betrayed. I didn't realise they were so racist. I did try hard, though. You played a dirty trick on me! Just pretend you're dead. Why should I clean up your mess? Let's talk quietly, Mr Kaneda. Loan Agreement We must do this... or we'll both be in deep shit. 1. 5 billion yen He'll never come out of this. They're yakuza, aren't they? Real ones, too. Guess who's here. It's Mr Arai, the financial king of the Korean immigrants. What are you doing here? You're needed to unify our homeland. You'd better hurry off in your Mercedes. Watch your tongue, you loser. Why don't you wind up the business? It's only a tiny taxi company, no big deal. Would you mind leaving us alone? We're talking as ex-classmates. Please ignore us. I suggest you act at once. You're not bound by Japanese law-. Shut up, you idiot! This is none of your business! Shall we come back another day? You guys seem to get easily excited. Keep well, Tadao. You too. Why don't you say a gentle word or two? Idiot! Can't you even tell a lie? I could shed some tears then. Damn you. How's business? It's so-so. How's business? How's business? It's so-so... Work's been very intense. Our boss is working a lot harder. The trouble is the loan from the yakuza. Working flat out, we can just pay the interest. Nothing can surprise me now. What's that for? Why do you hit an old man like me? My wheel came off on the expressway! You changed it this morning. No violence, please! Stop it, Anbo. Who'll pay for his funeral if you kill him? - The company can't. - I'll see to my own affairs. How will you do that? That's enough! He says he'll kill himself. Hello. You know... I wanted to own a golf course. I had to have it. You should have been satisfied with a pinball parlour. You'd have owned a building if it had been successful. I'm sorry. It was an accident. For both yakuza and Koreans... there'll be a lot of work to do. It's not a big deal. May I? Thank you. Another one, please. A different pose. Now, now. There's a good baby... Fire! Fire! Bring water! The hose, quick! Sell! Put it out, quick, you bastards! You fucking... The fire! I want a Filipina called Connie. Found her at last! I caught a bad disease from that rotten woman. I'm coming for her now. Tell her to wait for me right there. You bastard! I hope you rot in hell. What a coincidence! Where are you going? Want a ride? So it was you, eh? - I've missed you, Connie. - You make me sick. Connie... I'm the only one who can understand you. Listen, Connie. Once there was a big war. I've had enough of your bloody stories. - Where to, Miss? - Manila, the Philippines. Thank you for riding with us. I'm your driver. My name... is Ga.
