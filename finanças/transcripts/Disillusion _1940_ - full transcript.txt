THE PANNIER OF PAPA MARTIN No, not like that! You got the muscles but not the touch. This is how you do it. Heave! See how easy it is? - Thank you, Papa Martin. Martin! Hello, Papa Martin, we've been expecting you. "We?" Aren't you by yourself? Me and this guy! It's 100 year old port. I bought it in Lisbon for you. We'll drink it with Armand. - Is he here? No, he's in Paris but he comes tonight. To celebrate his papa, eh? How many years will it be? So few it's not worth counting. I'm really happy to see Armand again. The Lawyer Armand Martin. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37? You're better than a pastry chef! Are there 60 candles? - 60. He's old, poor Papa Martin. - And you're a coquette! You celebrate your name day, but not a word about your birthday. No sweets and no candles. Nobody knows Mama Rosa's age. It's best. There'd be too many and not even a grandmother yet. My Armand must decide soon or I won't get there in time. Mrs Bernard must have arrived with that terror of a son. Get down! Don't start! I want the fruit! - Get down! His climbing drives me crazy. - He'll be a great mountaineer. Rather, Am?lie, go to those people. Should they say we left them alone? But Mrs Rouger will play the hostess. Sit down, Mrs Bernard. Mrs Rosa and Miss Am?lie will be here soon. - Thanks. I want the fruit! - No! Your head's always in the clouds. Heavens, everybody knew! It's not like you just met Martin. You know, dear, I don't meddle in other people's business. I really thought Am?lie and Armand were brother and sister. - How? In fact, I believe Martin dreams of a wedding between the two. Very well. But who knows what Armand thinks. - Why? He'll return from Paris with a law degree. Am?lie's a fine girl but she's nobody's child. Oh, Papa Martin! Happy birthday! - Thank you, Ma'am. Happy birthday. - Thank you, all. Thank you. Captain. - And Armand? Isn't he here yet? I hope I didn't miss him. So many people at the station. There'll be another train arriving. - Yes, the 8:30. He'll come on that. One can't take you anywhere! Will you stop it, eh? What do you want? This? - Yes. Ah, yes! But to carry that, you need muscles, you know? You must be big and strong. Wait right there. Want to see what we'll do? Come here, dear. For you. Climb up! - Oh, Mr Martin! Just like that. And now? 1, 2? - And 3! And 3! Bravo! Oh, Mr Martin! He's too heavy. Eh, I've loaded many other weights, dear lady. For 40 years, I've been carrying this on my back! And it has brought you fortune. By dint of sweat, old friend. I used to earn 4: 2 for my Rosa, and 2 in the bank book. That's Armand. - Excuse me. No, Mama, I want to stay there! You carry me. Will you stop? Else, you're going home. Got it? Oh! Morison. Happy birthday, Papa Martin. - Thank you. Look who's here. What do you think? He just came from Paris. A lawyer? - No architect. Ah, excuse me. Thinking of Armand, I fancy there all lawyers. Excuse me. - No need, Papa Martin. Mr Morin! - Hello. Ah, you're there too, Captain. Yes, Papa Martin invited me. - He did right. Wonderful! - Did you make it? Well done! - You're quite the pastry chef. My compliments, Miss Am?lie. Didn't you see Armand? You would've been traveling on the same train. I never met him in Paris either. Well, it makes sense. Lawyers and architects follow different paths. They never do meet! Mr Morison! My son. How do you find him? See the advantage of being old? In order to be able to place 60 candles, you need a very big cake. At 80, it must be even bigger. - And at 100, this big! Let's hope we get there. The spirit's willing. Now, you must blow them all out. - One moment! For the party to be complete, we must wait for Armand. But you'll all be hungry. - No, please! Of course not. - We'll wait for him. Yes, let's wait for Armand. Architect! Tell us something about Paris. - Excuse me. What a handsome boy. Remember when he used to play with Armand? They were just kids and now? Children are a great labor but sometimes, they give great satisfaction. Now, I'll have him build me a house and I want to live there, on the top floor. To show everyone how sure you are of your son. That's Armand! - Armand! Papa Martin? A telegram for you. Will you sign? Here you go. Good day, Papa Martin. A telegram. - Armand? Where are my glasses? - Give it here! But you can't read. You open it. "Must prepare for exams. Impossible to leave Paris. All my best wishes. Kisses, Armand." He could've came for one day. Shut up, you know nothing! 24 hours isn't nothing? to a student who must prepare for graduation. Do you think studying is easy? As easy as carrying a pannier on your back? His brain must be at it day and night! And we mustn't be selfish. We rather should be happy he's studying. So smile! In a few months we'll have him here among us, in his studio, with tons of clients. And on the door there'll be a beautiful plaque written on it: Counselor Armand Martin. What about that, old lady? That has been the dream of my whole life. And then? And then Papa Martin finally will be? Grandpa Martin. And now, let's go to lunch. Ladies and gentlemen, Armand cannot come! He has to study. But we'll drink his health all the same! With pleasure! The child has something to say. Let's hear it. "Long live, long live, another hundred years, without any pain and without any fears. Between affection and friendship, a life without hardship, a life that is best. All of us wish so, from the oldest to the youngest. With our wishes, we hope to hearten our Mr Papa Martin." Well done! - Well done! I am the banner of the barracks! I don't have stripes but all are at my orders. Hey! To these smiles, to these amorous glances, the corporal and the sergeant stand at attention! Trumpet player, play your best. Play louder, I want to know if the general is almost here. If that's the case, my dress will be even sweeter for him, you know, it's my duty. To these smiles, to these amorous glances, the corporal and the sergeant stand at attention. Hey! I am the banner of the barracks. I don't have stripes or breeches. What to do? Forward, march! Let's go up again and try a higher number. Tonight, you're gonna lose. But we bet on everything: love, game, women. Everything. Mr Martin? Put this champagne on my bill. - Very well, Mr Martin. 52? 7 and 5 makes 12? 275 and 50. 34, red, even, passe! Give me a louis. I only have two. - Give it here and I'll double it. Didn't you lose yesterday? - Some change. What Papa sent me to go to Le Havre. I telegraphed him for more. - Then, take it. Sometimes, you lose one night, but the next you win. The bets have ended! 17, black, odd, manque! - You see? This is my lucky charm. How many times has it landed on 17? Twice, Ma'am. Here, ladies and gentlemen. The bets have ended! 17, black, odd, manque! Amazing! - Did you win? - Two plein. Your handkerchief brought me even more luck. And I came to get it back. - No! I'm kidnapping both of you! It's 17 again! Well done! Place your bets. Who is that young man over there next to Olympia? He's been here a few nights. He's a certain Mr Martin from Le Havre. Martin? - Yes, the son of a shipowner. Rich? He's the best friend of Count Lucien de Lagard?re. And you know Count Lucien lives only with rich friends. Very good. The new secretary is waiting for you in your office. You always keep your word, eh? I work in your house and I try to do my best. Well done. Ah, very good. Please, sit down. Miss? Miss? - Margot. Margot. Do you live in Paris? - No, I arrived yesterday. Very good. And where were you born? - Perpignan. Ah, Perpignan! Spanish blood, eh? And how old are you? - 21. Since when? - About a month. Then you're an adult, eh? And your parents? - Papa is dead. Excellent. And mama? I don't know anything about her. - Perfect. Stand up a bit. Turn around. Excellent. Sit down. Have you ever worked? - Yes, in my town. I kept accounts and correspo? - I don't care about that. I speak Spanish and I even speak English. That is much more useful. My clientele is cosmopolitan. The more, the better. Working here for me means absolute peace for you, Miss. Absolute. You can even save up money. The only thing I require is that you be free from all ties. Sentimental ones too. - But? From this moment on, you mustn't think about your past or your future. It's the present that matters. This is a mutual deal we're negotiating on and I don't want to waste my time or my money. Yes, Sir. - Well then, I'll make you a one-year contract. - A year? Yes, for now, but I'm sure we'll renew it. Thank you. And say, do just have this one dress? No, I've another that's much nicer: it's black. But I didn't make it. A seamstress made it for me. At Perpignan? - Yes. Yeah, but this is Paris. And one needs to be a Parisian from top to bottom. But that won't be a problem for you. I'm sure you'll be a success. When do I work? Because? I'd like to get a room nearby to be on time in the morning. We'll come to an agreement on that. And the wages? To start out, I'll give you 60 francs a month. 60 francs? 60 francs! Life in Paris is much more expensive than in Perpignan, my little Margot. Here. Tomorrow, after breakfast, you'll go see this lady. She's a Parisian 100%. "Olympia, Rue Richelieu, 37." What is it? What's going on? For heaven's sake! I bet those louis, you swindler! Cheat! Scoundrel! Gentlemen, please! Be calm, gentlemen! What's going on? - Come on, gentlemen! Calm down! I had bet three louis on 17! - A lie! My friend has bet on 17 all night. Am I right? - It's true. Fine. In any case, I want no scandal in my house. Pay out both bets. - Very well. As for you, young man, please don't set foot here again. This is not a gambling den but a gentlemen's club. - But I? You'll be paid and I advise you to keep quiet because? Because? Because we understand each other. Gentlemen, place your bets! Please excuse me, Mr Martin. May I? Charan?on. A pleasure. Very good. Consider yourself at home here. You are a bit disheveled. Miss Olympia, be kind and offer your dressing room to Mr Martin. Of course, with pleasure. Would you like to? - Thanks. Help yourself. The betting has ended! May I? - Yes. But haven't you drunk enough? Never enough! Such a boy. Why do you drink so much? It's all your fault. That's why I'm here every night. I drink, play but deep down I don't care about the wine. Nor gambling. Say no more. And above all, no confessions. Tomorrow, you might repent it. Why? I know perfectly well what I'm saying. Besides, it doesn't take much to understand. If I come here, it's only because of you. To hear you, to see you, to be close to you. Look in the mirror. How rebellious they are. Wait. No, not like that. I look like a customs worker. - How then? The parting on the side. Sorry, the little lord doesn't want to look like a daddy's boy. Olympia! Like this? Now you're presentable. What's your name? - Martin. Yes, I know. Your first name? - Armand. Ah, you have a romantic name. Do you live in Paris? Yes, in a nice flat that waits only for you. To introduce me to your parents? - No. Papa and mama aren't with me. They live in Le Havre. And the nice papa fills your pockets with dough? Of course. He has it and I spend it. That's what fathers are for. Those that can. Armand, come here. There. Now, you're perfect. - Olympia! Rebel! I love you! No, no, Armand. Someone might come in. Oh, no, Armand, are you mad? Come in. Am I intruding? There we go. You look much better like that. I wanted to apologize for that incident a little while ago And I beg you not to stand on ceremony with me. I want to be to you like an old friend. And if you need anything? - Thank you. I just meant that? if you lost at play, I'm here to do what I can. I didn't lose. Then a piece of advice: go to bed. Play is like an abyss which can engulf you, if you don't stop in time. Not long ago, a wretch was about to fall in. To save him, I bought from him something that he could sell for little money and I paid him out 100%. But it was all in vain. Because play had emptied his pockets. Watch out. How beautiful! Will you sell it to me, Charan?on? I'm sorry, Miss Olympia, but I think that this would be beyond your means. I believe, Mr Charan?on, that your indiscretion borders on impertinence. Pardon. I really don't want to be a bother. I hope to see you soon, Mr Martin. Is that guy your lover? - What's wrong with you? Is it the champagne or have you lost your mind? Neither. I just need to know. He's just my manager. And now, go to sleep, like a good boy. No dreams and no nightmares and tomorrow it'll all be better. I don't want to sleep! And I don't want you to treat me like a kid! I'm not a boy and I want to prove it! Whether you like it or not, I'll prove it! Good night. Papa Martin! Papa Martin. What is it? - Guess. Guess what I have for you. - For me? Yes, for you. And also a little for me. A letter from Armand. Let's read it. The children are waiting for me at school. We must first let Mama Rosa know. Rosa! Rosa! A letter from Armand. Come! - What does it say? And now let's hear it. "Dear papa and dear mama, don't expect big news from me. Life here is rather monotonous. All I do is work and study. Work and study. I attend the courses from morning to evening, and at night I prepare for the coming exams." Poor boy! But he's a man. He needs to work. How severe, my girl! No, I just want him to become someone. He's so talented. Sure, he has it in spades. Especially with the means you send him to study with. Don't exaggerate. I just send what he needs, nothing more. "Sometimes I would like to have some fun, but life is terribly expensive in Paris and with the last check you sent me, I had to buy some books. I hope all of you are well. Kisses, dear papa and beloved mama, with all my tenderness. Armand." Oh, but? you'll see that there'll be another, separate letter. Keep talking. Say something. You see, my girl, I can feel him thinking of you. Look into my eyes. Be strong. You know, when one is young, sometimes one is selfish. And when one is in love? You know what I mean. A bit of patience. You're very kind, Papa Martin. What do you expect? When you have an only son, you only think about his happiness. Of course. Armand must be happy. It's late. I'm going to the school. Goodbye, Papa Martin. But this is madness. - No, it's a gift. Do you like it? - Yes, but? There are no "buts." It's what you desired. How did you get it? That's a secret. I found it. I would've found it even if I had to go to the ends of the earth. Armand! Olympia? Let's leave! I don't know why? but I still feel you're far away. I want you all to myself. For me alone. Let's go away, Olympia. Let's leave. It can't be done. I have my job. How annoying. Always that job! It's the only way to be independent. In fact, tell the driver to hurry, we've been too late. Come on, hurry! Is she new? Where is she from? She's the boss's latest discovery. A glass of champagne? - No thanks. Don't you drink? - I don't know, Sir. Then let's dance! No, you can't come in. I need to change. It's late. - You always manage to disappear. Tonight, I'll sing a new song for you. Now go. You're late. Where have you been? I don't like these? nightly excursions of yours. It's bad for your health. You can afford the hospital if I get sick. - But? It's impossible! It's already done? Ah, you're so naughty! You had news to tell me and you kept it secret. Well done. You got class. Take it and go away. I said go away. I want to be alone. - What a woman! Sometimes I forget. You'll have your check. I want it tonight. Don't trust your old friend? I said tonight. I've always paid on time. As you can see, it was ready. If he could recognize which is fake and which is real, that young man could change his profession. Wait? one moment. I might not be able to tell either. And don't forget to put it on. Fine. Now get out. No? Let me tell you I love you? - Will you go? ?that I adore you, that I'm mad about you. - Oscar, if you really don't want me to say something unpleasant, go away! Gentlemen, place your bets! The betting has ended! 32, red, even, passe! Mr Martin, come to my office, please. That boy was unlucky. Well done. You're as light as a feather and sensitive to the dance's rhythm. You'll be famous. I know what I'm talking about. Antonio! Demi-Sec. You forgot that tonight? I had to give you the IOUs signed by my father? - Right. But I was hoping to give you the same sum in cash. Hoping? How? By play? You're an optimist. - Oh, no! I have a friend who owes me? - Count Lucien de Lagard?re? A nice young man. A fine name. But I prefer your father's. I'm not here to listen to your compliments. And I'm not here to waste my time. I don't live on hope, my boy. I'm not that young and? I have no more illusions. Therefore, if you don't have the bills as agreed upon, I'll be forced to go in there, to Miss Olympia and take back the jewelry. You can imagine the scene. You won't do that? I'm truly sorry but I've no choice. You don't know the Charan?on management. Here are the bills. Very good. Everything in order. Would this be your father's signature? No, but after all, it's just a simple formality. Evidently. Exactly. Like a dream, the short illusion of your love has passed me by. But a great passion has remained in my heart and forever it will stay with me. When alone, I will say your name, when it still seems I am yours. From that dream and that illusion, my mind will draw comfort. And if one day far away, returning to the remembrance of my heart which never forgot, you will find love again. Like a dream, the short illusion of your love has passed me by. And if one day far away, returning to the remembrance of my heart which never forgot, you will find love again. I gave him the bills signed by me and? you know who. - So? I did all that because you guaranteed me. - Sure. My uncle wasn't home tonight but he'll give me the money tomorrow. The first due date is Saturday. That's 48 hours. Then it's as good as done. Tomorrow, you can get it back. Are you sure? - As sure as I stand here. Well done. You were delightful. You didn't even see me. All you did was talk. Thanks. - Miss Olympia! Would you like to come by to the office for a moment? I'm coming. Did you spend all the 10,000 francs I gave you? Almost. Give me the louis. - You still want to play? You're not up to it. Let it go. I need 5 minutes of luck and I'll get back those IOUs. Since I don't see your uncle's money? Don't worry. Please give me those louis. Be careful. The signature is nicely imitated. And I fell for it. This boy will rise. You really want to ruin him, eh? It's ignoble. So many scruples! It's a bit late to start playing the moralist. We have too many sins to atone for together. And you take advantage of it. I take advantage of everything. It's my weakness. And then you exasperated me with that boy! But what intentions do you have? Careful, when I want to I can be bad. Very bad. You don't know how to do anything else. You're rotten through and through. If within 48 hours, you haven't provided for? Then today is the first one due? I begged Charan?on to wait two more days. Go home. It's better to throw yourself on your knees before your papa. You who can still do that. Go. Do as I say. Miss, a boy came and begged me to tell you that Signor Armand is here. Armand! Papa. By the way, since you've been in Paris, one needs a notarized letter to see you. Why didn't you get off? - No, Papa, see? Yes, I understand. You're tired: The journey, the train? But you'll see it's worth it to come home every now and then. Nowhere in the world, can you sleep as well than in your own bed. Of course. Come, I want you to try some port Captain Dubourg gave me. Is he here? - Yes, he arrived from Portugal. Is he leaving again soon? - I think so. Listen, Papa, I must tell you something. You can tell me later at breakfast. This way Mama Rosa and Am?lie? Speaking about Am?lie? It's a very delicate thing. But in short? you must realize that? - How is Am?lie? Ah, well. Very well. She has become a young lady. Graceful, beautiful? - Ah, good. Wouldn't you be glad to see her again? - I would. Very much. - Thank heavens. There must be no secrets with papa. I know all. Show me what you brought her from Paris. - From Paris? Yes, a souvenir. You didn't forget, eh? Well, I understand: your studies, the exams? We'll fix that right now. Luckily, the shops are still open. I'll be back in 15 minutes. But? don't say a word to Am?lie, eh? Hello, Am?lie. Hello, Armand. Are you going out? - Yes. No. No, I'll go out later. But it wouldn't be I who? No, it's not you. How are you, Armand? - Fine. And you? I'm fine too. Did you work a lot in Paris? - Yes, a lot. You'll have your graduation exams soon, right? If nothing prevents me. What? Aren't you sure? - Of course! Of course! Why are you looking at me like that? I told you everything's fine! Isn't that enough? Armand! I ask your forgiveness. Oh, good! Do me a favor, dear. Bring this antipasto over there. Did Armand come down? - Yes. You must understand me, Am?lie. I do. It isn't like that. We haven't seen each other for ages. A year is a long time. Maybe, even too much. No, I swear I've always thought about you. Do you believe me? I believe you. What? Are you already home? - Yes. But doesn't school finish at one? Yes, but the principal wanted to? - Ah, that's it. Fine, then we'll just have to tell Mama Rosa that I'm back and go to the table. I'm hungry like a wolf. Go on. Am?lie! Excuse me, I wanted to give you this little souvenir I brought. You see it's quite modest. How lovely! But it's too much. Thank you, Armand. It's wonderful. A little thing of no value. What do you mean no value? My Armand is full of good taste! My God, this chain isn't that great but? but it must've cost you! Right, Armand? Why this? this is 18 carat gold. Let me see. Let me see! Look, Mama Rosa, what Armand gave me. How fine! From Paris, eh? Yes, Paris. My dear only son! - Knock off that smothering! For you, Armand, here. Am?lie, this is your place. So selfish! Who knows how many kisses you gave him while I was working in the kitchen? Here! - Oh, no! The lawyer first! Come in. I brought you coffee. Thank you, dear. And Mama Rosa? She went out early. It's market day. Poor thing, you must work even this Thursday, when the school is on vacation. You need anything? I'll get the milk. Mama Rosa forgot it. It's natural. Her Armand comes and she loses her head. But you didn't lose yours, eh? Is he still asleep? - Armand? Yes. Ah, let him sleep. Somebody rang. - I'll go see. May I help you? Does Signor Martin live here? Papa Martin? Yes, Armand's father. - Please, come in. But? excuse me, is this really the house of Armand's father? Yes. Why? Oh, nothing. Just wondering. I was wondering? And you're Armand's sister? - No, Sir. That's why there was no resemblance. You're quite pretty though. Papa Martin! What is it? Mr? Whom do I owe this pleasure? - Charan?on. A friend of Armand's. I'm delighted to meet you. Take a seat, Sir, please. Ah, no! You'll be more comfortable here. I'm sorry Armand is still in bed at this hour. I'll go wake him up. He's a bit of a lazybones. He's studied so much, poor boy. It's better to overlook it. Very good. A little paternal weakness, eh? I ask for nothing better than to be a little weak. Besides, that's the papa's role. I'll go call him. No! Wait, let him sleep. Not at all! Armand will be glad to see his old friend from Paris. And then you took the trouble to come here. No. I beg you. It's better that Armand stay where he is. But? Papa Martin, I'll go buy the milk. Yes, dear, you may go. My goddaughter. So pretty. Do you have money? - Yes, I have enough. Go on. When ones sees such a delightful creature, we Parisians must admit that our tastes have been corrupted. This is where true grace is, true purity. Here in the province. Ah, yes. It's only human? to prefer what you don't have. Have a seat. You must take something. - No. Yes, drink something. Would you like a glass of port? No, I never take anything in the morning. Thank you. Well, I notice you have simple tastes, Mr Martin. Everyone has their own habits. Since you are my son's friend, no more "Mr." Hell, I'm Papa Martin to everyone here. And I want to be to you too! Very well, Papa Martin. You're a curious man. You love modest things. You just need to watch the port where they load and unload your steamships. My steamships? - Certainly. I have no steamships. You don't anymore now? Oh, no! I've worked much in the port, that is true, but I've never even owned a boat. The secret of happiness is to be in a good humor. And I see you don't lack that, my dear Papa Martin. You know how to juggle well. Which means? It means you're clever. You've raked in money as a shipowner? and you prefer that nobody knows. Bravo! I knew that Armand was a joker, but that he came to tell you that I? But not that! Perhaps you'll deny that you prefer to stay in Le Havre? How does one say it? Because of gratitude, or nostalgia for the past? First of all, it's not true that I've raked in a lot of money. And then it's not for nostalgia? that I remained in Le Havre. I've stayed here because I couldn't live anywhere else. I put aside a little bit of money, working as a porter? because I kept faith with one of my maxims: Two francs in wages, one to my old Rosa for the home, and the other in the bank. And I predict my Armand will do the same thing. Interesting. Let's not exaggerate. One must learn how to impose privations. You must ask sacrifices of yourself and others. But at least, you'll have a peaceful old age. I'm sorry, Mr Martin. Sorry? Why? On your behalf. Maybe you think I haven't managed my life well. I understand. You Parisians have other habits. - That's no concern of yours. Excuse me. Maybe I was a bit gabby. No, on the contrary, you've done well to speak. Well, I'll go wake Armand. - No, it's pointless. I've listened to you up to now to see how far your complicity went. Complicity? Or thoughtlessness. I don't know yet. What are you trying to say? I don't understand. Look here. You certainly haven't forgotten these? On each of these is my name and your signature. When you signed, you surely read them. But I've never? Then this thing? becomes more serious, a matter for the Penal Code. How? Don't you see? The court, the police, the prison! You wouldn't want to send my son to prison? Well? Oh, but? but it's not possible! And yet? it is. Yes? I was the one who signed those promissory notes. So I'm responsible. I wasn't thinking? Old age. It was me! Very well. My apologies. - Why? Could you doubt for one moment that signature wasn't mine? Could Armand have done such a thing? A boy who plays like a madman, who loses his head over a dancer, who buys jewels, signs bills and then signs them? - No more! You live in a dream world. Perhaps? But what is certain? is that you are scum! I have a piece of advice for you: There's the door! Very well. Before I leave, however, I need to tell you? that I don't want to hurt anyone. The only thing I want is my money. Nothing else. How much? 60,000 francs. My train leaves tonight. I'll spend the day at the hotel where I'll wait for you to come. But? please don't come too late. Otherwise, if you have something to tell me in Paris, here is my address. Charan?on, Rue Royale, 134. Understood? I'm an honest man, Mr. Charan?on. - I have no doubt about it. Rest assured that everything will be settled. I just need to ask you for time. Unfortunately, I'm no trader. I don't do long-term business. I'd pay you interest. I'm not a banker either. However? Listen well, it's better to get it settled quickly. Better for you and for me. Don't you think so? See you soon, Mr Martin. Well, I'm going. Miss. Until we meet again. Papa Martin. What is it? What's the matter with you? Nothing. Did you go get the milk? Well, go! Go and boil it. That's all I was able to get from the bank. For the rest of the sum, I brought you these articles? which I hope you'll accept. I didn't even know what this stuff was. Well, there's no need for them now. But there is. These are also signed by you, right? So? - But there's also my son's signature. So much the better. - Oh, no! I wouldn't? Give me those bills! - For now, I'll grant you? a provisional receipt. After the full payment of the total, you'll get these bills back. Usurer! Careful or you'll compromise your son. My respects, Mr Martin. And Papa Martin? - He's out. I'd like to know where he's always going to. And Armand? - I was going to wake him up. Go on. Papa Martin! Captain. - We leave at noon. Bon voyage, Captain. Where are you going? - China. So far away? - A year of travel isn't much. For who goes. But for who stays behind? Is the crew already full? If you're referring to yourself, there's always a cabin. Ah, me? When I was young I wanted to be a sailor. But now? - It's never too late. We'll play some fine games and then in China, there are beautiful girls. Yellow, but pretty. No? seriously, Dubourg, would you take Armand with you? Armand? But isn't he studying in Paris? He can no longer study. He has to work. Right away. But it'd be a punishment. Did he commit any foolishness? - It's not a punishment. Armand? must help me. I leave at noon. Time enough to go to the bank to take care of something? and then I'll return here with Armand. I'll wait for you. Thank you, Captain. Stop it! That beast got on my nerves! - Armand, what's the matter? - Nothing! What should be? While you were sleeping, someone came from Paris. Who? - A friend of yours. Lucien! And why didn't you call me? I don't remember if his name were Lucien. His last name was Charan?on. He wanted to talk to your father. I wonder why. What did you do, Armand? I needed money to be worthy of her, her life of luxury. Now I understand everything. Don't leave. If you leave me too, I'll have no one in my life. You forget your father, Armand. Forgive me. I don't know what I'm saying. But stay, Am?lie. I beg you. Am?lie! Armand? Aren't you coming down? - We're coming, Mama! Oh, finally! What's the matter with you? You're pale. Aren't you feeling well? It's nothing. But why won't you talk? Your face looks upset. Don't you think I don't know that something has happened? No, dear, don't worry. How can I not worry when you're hiding something? A secret? And this is the first time because you've never hidden anything. Never! No, you can't fool me. You can't keep silent. Even if you don't speak, I see. I've lived by your side for 35 years. I know you more than myself. So speak. What's the matter? I know, Mama. - You be silent! Don't get mixed up in things that don't concern you. But what has happened, in the name of God? What has happened? If you really want to know, I'll tell you. You know? Morison? - Well then? You know he was my best friend. A misfortune? Is he dead? Much worse. He's ruined himself. - What? He had managed to secure a peaceful old age? and then? who knows how? unclean business, speculation? He lost everything. But the last time he came here with his son, he was even talking about having a house built. He had lost his head. - And his son? It was about him? that I was busy with this morning. There are times when you need to know how to take action. And since Morison? wasn't capable due to fear or cowardice to take any, I made decisions for him. His son will embark with Dubourg? and leave at noon for China. And so that poor boy will have to sacrifice himself for his father? Right. He must sacrifice himself for his father. Now it'll be his turn to work. Just imagine his mama's sorrow. She'll wait for his return. But to leave so suddenly? With only the clothes on his back. We'll give him something of Armand's. He has lots of stuff. I'll take care of it. Come, Am?lie. Come, help me. Papa? I don't know how you? The only thing that matters is that your mother never knows. Papa. I give you my word. Yeah, it's useless. You can't believe me anymore. I can no longer give my word. Let's not talk about it. At least, let me say that I'll do all that I can to clear my mistakes and make you forget all the damage I've done. That's what I want. What pains me most? is that you have betrayed my trust. No, Papa! - Yes! Money doesn't matter. You gain it, you lose it. But what is inside takes shape? and remains. If you don't become a lawyer, oh well, one can live without being a lawyer. Maybe it was a dream. Maybe after all, it was my fault. No, Papa! - Yes. Now I realize it. When does the ship leave? In an hour. Thank you, Papa. Here's the packet. Take it to that boy right away and give him a kiss for me. Tell Dubourg to treat him like his own son. Mama! Wait for me, Am?lie. I'll wait for you. What is it? Am?lie! Armand? I'm afraid. I'm afraid? Oh, Papa Martin, do you have a match? Is there any work in the port? - Eh, what we can settle for. I'll return to my place. With the pannier on my back again. Nostalgic? Right. And then everyone has their set destiny. There are those who are born to do nothing all their life, and then there are those who must always work. Until the end. Are you still here? Today there's no cargo or passengers. It's beastly cold. It's snowing and it's like Siberia. I heard from the grocer that Marcel's leaving next week for America. Good, we'll earn money. - Let's hope so. With what things are costing. Look. A kilo of carrots. A kilo of carrots is nothing, right? Fine. Do you know how much they cost? Three sous. And the cauliflower, the eggs, the milk? Let's not even talk about meat, which we can do without. I understand. Ask for money. If you don't want me to wait for he who left to earn on your behalf, that poor son of mine? It's useless to shrug your shoulders. I will never forgive you. You could've ruined yourself even more, selling those few rags, even left us with no food, but to make that poor boy leave? Ah, no! And then to lie? Mama Rosa! Mama Rosa! A letter from Armand. I met the postman on my way here. - How lucky! You're always bumping into the postman. A good sign. Yes. Well? "Dear papa and beloved mama, here I am in Ceylon in the East, the triangle of a wondrous world." You see how he likes to travel? - My poor boy. "I've seen little of the city, we're almost always on board working. And though Captain Dubourg treats me like everyone else, I realize that I have earned his complete respect. Next week we will drop anchor and head for China." China? Yes, China. A wonderful country. One moment. Look, there's more. More? "I can't send you more, but accept it from the heart. Armand." Ah! This I will hold onto. You're capable of making some more ill-chosen speculations. I've told you a hundred times! Write the letters as long as you want, but no money! Poor Mama Rosa, she was so happy. And no news from Armand? - No. I've been to the shipping office. They know nothing about him. Cholera. Raise the yellow flag. It's hard to have to croak like this. Long live the face of a beautiful storm, a wave that sweeps you away and no more is said about it. And who knows how long we'll have to stay here. Until we're all dead. And to disinfect it, they must burn the ship. I want to write to your father? that you are a brave boy. And then I also want to write? to the management of the company. They must? reward you. Give you a position. I wanted to do all that upon my return but? I feel that now? it's over. You are young, strong? you will certainly be able? to save yourself from this sickness? which spares no one. You'll come back too. I am sure of it. You only need to have the will. Captain, the helmsman? Him too. Martin? What is it? - Am?lie? Is she alright? - She left for Paris. Don't joke! - I wish it were a joke. This morning, they came to confiscate our furniture. Charan?on? - Yes. Am?lie managed to stop it. She went to beg him not to ruin us. You shouldn't have let her go! - She wanted to go at any cost! She said she will be able to persuade him. Am?lie with that scum? I would've preferred to beg. Hey, Martin! It's getting late. We need to load up. Go on. Who is disturbing me? When I give orders not to disturb, I don't want to be disturbed! Look who's here! You here in Paris? Ah, then this means? Papa Martin's goddaughter, right? Have a seat, please. Sit down. Miss? Miss? Am?lie. - Ah, right. Am?lie. But what an ugly name. We'll have to change it. Tatiana! You even look a bit Russian. Tatiana would suit you perfectly. That's not why I came here, Mr Charan?on. Of course, I can imagine. What can I do for you? Please, tell me. You ruined a man who took responsibility for things he didn't do. I ask you, therefore, some mercy for him. Very well. Your little friend should be envious. You would've made a better lawyer than he. First of all, the youth you refer to is not my little friend. And I don't think? - Listen, young lady, if you came to give me a lecture, you're wasting your time. No, I have no such intention. I only ask you to have mercy on a poor old man. Nothing but mercy. My dear young lady, you're fighting a lost cause. After all, it's not the old man you care about but his son. That young man deserves no mercy. He has betrayed everyone, including yourself. Nevertheless, Mr Charan?on, please remove the confiscation. Papa Martin would die of grief. I'll go even further: I'll take care of you myself. In the meantime, I'll start off with some advice. Give up that miserable provincial life. You're so young, so pretty, you have no right to bury yourself in that indifference, seasoned with boredom and melancholy. What do you want me to do? First of all, you must send those tears away. Eyes as beautiful as yours should not cry, but smile. That's it. And then you must feel at ease. A new world awaits you, the world of Tatiana! Here in Paris. Paris? - Yes, I'll take you with me. You'll become my secretary. What do you want here? - I must speak to you. I don't have time! I must speak to you, Mr Charan?on. In this office, one can't get a moment of peace. Pardon. Let's go. What do you want here? Didn't I tell you not to bother me? I have no one else. I've done everything you asked. - And that's why I feed you. Now stop it! - You hurt me so much, but I can't do without you. Go away! Get out! Sorry, now I can attend you. Now, what were we saying? The confiscation. - The confiscation? Ah, yes, we'll fix everything. We shall. Where do you live now? The Hotel du Soleil. - For God's sake! I'll have your bags brought to Rue Richelieu. I don't have any bags. - Good, we'll make new ones. And this very day, I'll bring you to Miss Olympia. Olympia? - You don't know Olympia? She's the lady of the day! A superior woman, 100% Parisian. And a faithful friend. She will give you invaluable advice. How old are you? - 22. Excellent! You're an orphan, if I'm not mistaken? But why did you let her go? That's what I want to know! To fix the trouble you made! Because of you, we lost our son, Am?lie, everything! Martin, we're two poor old people who no longer know what they're saying. You are good, Martin. And I love you. I'd throw myself into the fire just to make you happy. Believe me. I know, dear. I do know. Indeed, I beg your pardon, if sometimes, I raise my voice. There's a young lady waiting. Good day, Ma'am. Good day. Did Mr Charan?on send you? - Yes. I'm sorry but it's late. - But I've waited for 3 hours. Let's hurry then. I've no time to lose. I'm already late and I have tons of things to do. Sit down. - Thank you. Are you experienced? Experienced? - I mean have you worked in Paris. Never. Where are you from? - Le Havre. Le Havre? Mr Charan?on, when he came to Le Havre, told me to come and see him. Wretch! And I came to Paris. On the other hand, if you have a good reason, you can do anything in life. And where is he? now? Who? Armand. He boarded a sailing ship. And we never heard anything more. I came here, because I couldn't let Papa Martin be kicked out of his house. I couldn't. - Why? Then it was Charan?on, right? He has bills from Papa Martin but there isn't much work in the port and he doesn't earn everyday. So, it'd be best for me to find work. Charan?on promised this morning that he'll stop the confiscation. Really? He promised you this morning? Then we'll try to hold him to his word. Tonight you'll come with me, you'll see my number and then we'll go together to talk to him. I have much faith in you. Antonietta? And when Armand comes back, you'll tell him that I? I'm not so bad. Thank you, Ma'am. Ma'am? - Bring me the green toilette. And if it's a bit long, you can trim it. It's for you. - For me? You told me you have faith. Well then? Is it possible you couldn't find any? It was already late, Sir. I've been to many florists but not one rose. Besides, carnations are beautiful. - A pity. But you see, every woman needs her flowers. And tonight we needed roses. Like a dream, the short illusion of your love has passed me by. But a great passion has remained in my heart and forever it will stay with me. When alone, I will say your name, when it still seems I am yours. Mr Charan?on? awaits you in the office. He has to talk to you. From that dream and that illusion, my mind will draw comfort. And if one day far away, I want to hear more of this song. You love music, eh? I'll come and get you later. of my heart which never forgot, you will find love again. Like a dream, the short illusion of your love has passed me by. And if one day far away, returning to the remembrance of my heart which never forgot, you will find love again. Ah, it's you, eh? Always you! Always me. And it's you who wanted that. But don't you see you annoy me? That you shouldn't come in here? I am the master! You got that? And I don't want to see you again! I'll throw you out into the street! That's what you deserve! You'll end up on the street! And now you may go to Monsieur Charan?on. Charan?on? Charan?on? He was murdered! Charan?on! The betting has ended! Charan?on was killed! - The killer left a revolver and a purse. But who was it? - Definitely a woman. Are you playing or not? THE MURDER OF AN ADVENTURER We're here, eh? A fine miracle. - I was sure of it. Let's go right to the manager and tell him we're not dead. Hurry up! Who the hell invented porters? They move like snails! Don't worry, Ma'am, we still have time. Yeah, you always have time! Why don't have a seat? What are you doing now? Oh, God! Not that luggage! I told you it was fragile! Everything is broken! Captain! Don't act like a boy. Run to embrace him. Nothing is broken, Ma'am. Excuse me. I don't know how it happened. If you're old, why are you a porter? I'm not so old, Ma'am? - Then make it snappy! Thank you. Papa! Armand! This is the limit! You must be kidding me. Porter! Porter! Take my bags! Hurry up! Don't worry, Ma'am. - If I may, Papa Martin? Tell me not to worry! Yes, go ahead and take it. Sorry, Ma'am, he's my son. Like I care! You want to make me lose my steamer! Let's go! At least, hurry up! Martin! Captain! What do you think of him, eh? - He looks well. He's sturdy. - And smart. I'm truly happy. Let's go home. - Just imagine Mama Rosa. Fainting is guaranteed. - Well, I'll leave you. No, you must come with us. I'll make you a fine soup. - Don't tempt me, Martin. We've eaten lots of cold food. Right, Armand? Then it's agreed. We'll expect you. It'll be ready in a half hour. - Yes, I'll come. I'll go to the office to take care of something and be back. Bye Martin. - Captain. And Am?lie? Am?lie isn't there. What? She went to Paris to see that scum. - Charan?on? Yes. He wanted to ruin us. - Because of me. I'm still making you suffer. No, Armand, don't talk like that. But now that I'm here, I'll go to Paris. Sure. But please, don't say a word to Mama. She's old, poor thing. I owe my life to him. And it's thanks to him the cargo's at port. And we're all grateful. He'll be awarded a prize. - He's a good employee. And I assure you that it'll be you who's getting a bargain. He's an honest young man, full of talent, and above all endowed with a great will. He wants to become someone. And he has that right. Let's get cracking, Mama Rosa! - Give me a moment's peace! Squeezing him for a half hour! What is a half an hour after a year of waiting? But now he won't be leaving us, you got time! Go, Captain Dubourg is coming and the soup won't be ready! There! Happy now? - Alright! Armand, you open the door. - Yes, Mama. Did he ask about Am?lie? I told him she went walking with the principal. Good. - I'm going to change. Am?lie! Armand! I am so tired. May I come in? Papa Martin. - Ah, good! I found the door open and came inside. And Armand? - I haven't seen him. Rosa! Rosa! Is Armand with you? - No. Good day, Mama Rosa. - Good day. But where did he go? Has he left? Am?lie! What did you do in Paris? Charan?on? He will never hurt us again. Forgive me, Am?lie. I love you. Am?lie, we'll be so happy. Rosa! Will you promise not to faint? Spit it out! Armand? is upstairs with Am?lie. Oh, God! - Huh? What's so strange about that? It's natural. Where should he be? Of course. It's natural. But what are they saying? I didn't quite understand? but I have the impression? that they will come to an agreement. English subs by sineintegral@KG
