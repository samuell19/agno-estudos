Ah, it's not like what you think. I'm just a bit emotionally unstable lately. Ah, sorry to make you look cruel. See you again at the practice, okay? Since I've bought a new bow, my violin will sound so good. Be prepared for that. Be prepared, she said. - By the way... - Part-time job now. Wait. You know, right? About you, I... Don't finish what you're saying. - What? - Sorry. Wait! Why did I act foolishly like that? I'm an adult. "Tami Mock Exam, Dinner Cruise at 6 PM" Tami, should I put some ice in your flask? Don't do that. It will be bad if my stomach gets cold. The dinner cruise will depart at 6 PM. Don't be late. It's at Shiosai Pier. Geez, why do you have to go to work today? It's consecutive holiday, right? There's no Reiwa or 10-days holiday in Indonesia. Tami, good luck on your mock exam. We'll have a buffet at a cruise ship later. - Okay~. - Good morning. A buffet on a ship... how complicated. - Hmm? - Are you going to work today? Yeah. See you later at 6. Huh? Ah, ah, is there any parking lot at Shiosai Pier? Ah... Mom, I'll be off to escort Tami now. Please eat your breakfast. Come on, it's time to go. Here's your lunch. - Tami-chan, good luck on your test. - Thanks~ Today will be cold, right? My pink coat... has it been returned from the laundry? - Ah, I'll look for it when I'm back later. - Okay. Well... since the ship will be departed at 6, I have to pick up Tami before that. I guess we should get changed and leave from home at 4.30. Ah, with Mom too. By the way, is there any parking lot at Shiosai Pier? Hmm? This isn't my cup, isn't it? "Kitagawa Tami - Exam Admission Ticket" It's already 5.30 now. We are on our way there! Today I forgot to bring Tami's exam admission ticket. - Ah, yeah. - I've got enough! - Huh? - I don't want to ride on the ship! Don't say such thing. Your father is waiting, you know. It's okay about the test. Though you were late, you still could do it, right? I was told that my grade was falling. I'll be in B class now. I can't enter Higano All-Girls School with that! Regardless your grade, you can take exams for any school you want to enter, right? Come on, we have to hurry! The ship will depart in 20 minutes. Mom, you too. It's impossible. I can't walk any faster. Let's just go home! You both should work harder! We've paid 28,000 yen for this! Let's eat crab and roast beef! Ah, ah... we made it! We made it! - Is it this one? That one. - Geez... You should have parked the car over there. What? - Geez, why don't you tell me earlier!? - What? Ah, ah, it's so cold. Ah, they have something like a chocolate fountain up there. You like sweets, right? It's cold! Physiotherapy Department - 3rd Year Clinical Training Guidance You need to pass the health care industry communication and practical skill simulation test. Otherwise, you can't take clinical training. At the clinical training, the real physiotherapist will teach you... Rihito was sent home from the hospital during his short-term training last year. A patient complained that he was scary. I remember that. But, by the way... ...don't you think he changed a bit after he started doing that? He's so good in it now, right? - Violin? - Yeah. Not at all. He's still at earplug level. Since he learned violin with that teacher as his aim... ...I thought he would get tired of it quickly. But because Rihito works so hard on that... - ...I'll work so hard to support him as well. - I see. - Sorry. - Yukie-san, are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just a slight cold. I'm sorry that I can't come to the practice. Come to think of it, Tami-chan will have exam since she's in 6th grade now. It's not the time for her to play the accompaniment for our concert. Ah, she's happy with that so it's okay. She's feeling down now, so I want to cheer her up. Ah, it's okay if you can't come. Please comfort Tami-chan instead. Ah, and you too, Yukie-san, take care of your health. Ah, thank you. Well then... Sorry for coming late. What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell too? No, no, no. My practical skill test is coming up so I have lots to memorize. - Ooh, hey, are you okay? - Ah. I'm sorry. Wow, it's amazing. Is it in summer? You said you'd have training. Ah, yeah, for 3 weeks. I guess we should postpone our three-con. Huh? Well, somehow... It's a crucial time for Yukie-san and Tami-chan now. And Rihito-kun too. You have no time to play violin now, right? But if we both are busy, you'll feel down again, right? Well, you're right. Before, I would feel so. Hmm? But it's different now. Well... if I think both of you are working hard... ...it will make me think that I should work hard too. - Hmm? - Nothing. But if I don't play violin, I won't improve much. I will stay at earplug level forever. Earplug level? Ah, well... someone told me that. Ah, what a good way of saying that. I guess that's right. - Huh? - Well, you know... ...it's true that we're still in such level, right? Earplug level. Let's use it as a band name, shall we? I like playing violin together with you and Yukie-san. But if I force you both to do it together now... ...I will just become attached... ...to you and Yukie-san, right? What about you, then, Yaeko-san? What will you do? Me? Well... I will practice violin so hard on your behalf too. I've bought new bow anyway. It reduced my savings by 50 thousands, though. It was so bold of you, huh? Hey, pick your words carefully. Well, it's true that a part of me think that I'm a bit foolish. - Insensitive, you mean? - Hey, you use the wrong word. - You're correcting me, huh? - Of course! It's an important part. Moreover, it was intentional, right? It's beeping. Hmm? Really? - Huh? - What? I... get a job. English subtitle by: aoihachi G Senjou no Anata to Watashi Episode 7. When You've Become Adult Everyone, let me introduce your new colleague. Well... My name is Kogure Yaeko. Until last year, I worked at the sales dept. of a built-in kitchen company. Now, while learning about the apartment renovation management... ...I will also learn from the site directly. I'm looking forward to work with you. Kogure-san, sorry if this is too sudden. Here is the store remodeling plan for Tajima Foods which we will handle together. We will have a presentation next week. Can you learn about that? Okay, I will do it. Sorry, I'll put it on silent mode. "They were born safely!!" Ah... they're so cute! Are you okay? Yeah. - I'll help you to stand up. - Okay. 1, 2, 3. Okay. Don't rush yourself. Let's do this slowly. Scary, scary. Your eyes are so scary. - 1, 2, 3. - Rihito, you're scary. Ah, I have to read the plan. - Are you okay? - Welcome home. - Let's do it once again. - Huh? Hmm, are you okay? Are you... Are you okay? By the way... I've got no chance to meet them both recently. Ah, the bow... "You've promised to give me your bow, right?" She must be sleeping. 3 months later How much is it different from the previous estimation? Well, if we use this forest hard... ...for the entire floor surface... ...it will be 170 thousands yen cheaper than the previous estimate. So, no symptoms occur in these past 2 weeks, right? - Yes. - Perhaps that's the result of the botulinum therapy. But since it will last around half a year only... ...let's adjust the dose while monitoring your condition. Okay. Then, I have something I want to discuss with you, Sensei. Ah... Ah... I see. So the symptoms are subsiding. Yeah, somehow I can feel it. It feels different from before. It's getting better. - Glad to hear that. - Thank you. And actually... ...a senior in my university before invited me for a concert. What? Are you going to perform there? Since the medical treatment finally shows some result... ...I guess I'll try it. - Ah, then, I will surely come to watch... - Ah, no! Don't! You can't come to watch. Because being nervous will be very bad for this disease. Mao-san, you won't be nervous even though I come, right? Of course I will! Well then, I have to go now. Um, if there's anything... Well, I still can't give you proper advice though. But if you have any worries about your hand or else, you can tell me. I think it will be easier for you to discuss about that with someone... ...who technically understands. I really wish it can be cured. As someone who has known you for a quite long time. Thank you. What is it? Somehow, you suddenly become an adult. Not at all. "Kogure Yaeko" "I want to give the bow to you." "Can you come to the practice just for a while?" "Sorry. I still have classes today. Next week?" "Okay then, next Monday. I guess I'm free at 6 PM." "Okay." Ah, it's hot. Hmm, I'm hungry. I wonder what will he eat? He eats deep-fried food all the time, right? "Sorry but my training is suddenly extended." "I can go there around 7 PM. You'll have lesson after this, right?" "Well, let's meet up next week, then." What the heck... "Sorry for this last-minute cancellation." "Since you have no bow, you can't practice at all, right?" "It's okay. Even though I have a bow..." "...perhaps I can't practice at all too." What the heck... Ah, this is tough. My hips hurt. For me, it's my hand. It's trembling. You can't play violin then. It's okay. I don't play violin recently. You quit playing violin? I liked your violin, you know. I mean... ...I like you, Rihito. I... ...can't answer your feeling, Shimizu. I'm sorry. That's why, you don't need to force yourself saying that you like violin. No. What I endured wasn't your violin... ...but the time you spent for the violin. I just thought... ...if you could spend those time for me instead. That's why, I pretended to have interest about that and waited. You should spend your time with someone else, not me. That way, I'm sure you'll be happy. Before, someone told me so. I can understand because in reality, that's true. Sorry. Thank you for today. - Excuse me. - Yes? - I forgot something. - Sorry, I don't realize that. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Were you practicing? Yes. Next time, I'll be performing in front of people. Can I listen to it a little bit? Rihito-kun. Rihito-kun~ Rihito-kun! She's coming again. It's for you, Rihito-kun. What is it? - Kogure Yae... ko. - Give it to me. It's amazing! As I thought, Mao-sensei's violin... ...is somehow so good. It's very charming. Thank you very much. You always praise me a lot, Kogure-san. I'm happy. Really? Glad to know that you got a job. Well, it took me a year and a half. But during that time, you played violin a lot. Yeah, it's true. Surprisingly, it was perhaps an essential time for me. Kogure-san, please continue playing violin. - Even though you will be busy after this. - I will continue it. Well, Rihito-kun and Yukie-san can't attend lesson anymore though. It will be great if the three of you can play together again. You get along very well. Well, sort of. I was a bit jealous. To you all. Huh? You don't know anything about each other. You have no particular bond too. You just incidentally met up here. But starting from that, you can get along so well. I'm really jealous. I wonder if it would be different... ...if we met that way too... Ah. - That's... - It's unfair. I know... that. It must be... ...'that', right? "Kase Rihito" Huh? Rihito-kun? - Hello. - Is your lesson ended already? Yeah. I'm about to go home now. What's wrong? You even phone me like this. You sent me the bow. - Oh, have you received it? - The packaging was too much. I want to make sure it won't be broken when you receive it. If so, you should have given it to me directly. You seem to be busy recently. I thought it'd be bad to call you out just for that. So you won't come in time like this. Huh? What's that, huh? Sending the bow just like that. Can we meet now? Ah, well... I have to be early tomorrow. Thank you so much for the bow. Huh? Huh? Nothing. Bye then. Bye. Why don't you reply immediately? I was scared, you know. If only I replied... ...0.5 seconds faster. My 28-years-old summer is ended. - Hello. - Dad, are you free to talk now? A month and a half later - Yeah. - It's about Tami. She's back to A class in her cram school. Just now, the test result is... ah! What's that? Mom, are you okay? Huh? Did you just fall? Ah, I'm okay, I'm okay... I stepped on Tami's skirt. It's time for your cram school, right? I'll escort you. You don't need to! How annoying! - Huh? - I can put my own clothes into the washing machine. And I can go to the cram school by bus. You always say, "It's okay, it's okay"... ...but you're actually not okay at all, right? Even when you had a fever, you pretended to be okay. I can do things by myself. If you got hurt, just go to the hospital! Tami... It's true. You always make a face as if you've sacrificed everything for your family's sake. We are tired of that, you know. Huh? You should just do things you like too. Ah, ouch, ouch, ouch... Hello? Hello? Hey, what happened? Hello! - Tami, let's take a photo. - Ah, that's a good idea. Come on. Okay. Cheese. That's good. Yukie, take a picture of us. Okay, okay. Come on. Pose together with Dad, okay? - How was it? - It's good. She has grown up now. So I don't have to pick you up later? Yeah. Yasuko-san will drive me home with her car. - Right? - Yeah. Sorry to trouble you. Thank you very much. - Let's buy T-shirts, shall we? - Let's take a look. I wonder if he will sing the Nagasaki song today? "Kitagawa Tami" "I'll go home with Sayumi-chan and my friends. You don't need to pick me up." Huh? Somehow, I'm free now. Ah, what should I do? Huh? Wow~ Mao-sensei! Huh? When is it? It's today, right? Wow, where is it? "Free admission" Where? Huh? Ah. What? Mao-sensei's violin? Yes. You want to hand it over to me? Kogure-san, you've bought such a good bow already. So if you'd like, you can have this. Ah, no, no, no, but... I mean... your violin is incredibly good, Mao-sensei. So I'm a bit afraid of playing it. I mean, it's a very good one, right? - It's expensive, right? - No, no, it's not like that. I can make it cheaper for you. But why? Actually, I want to work hard once again... ...as a performing musician. I gained confidence a little bit after the concert yesterday. So I want to buy a new violin. Ah, that's good. "Violin Three Musketeers" "It's about Mao-sensei, though..." Ah, Hiro-kun. What is it? My class has just ended. It's tough, you know. Mao came to our house just now. Huh? Why? She must have come to see you, right? - Huh? - Something might have happened. She even came to our house. It must be serious, right? But if it's something about her hand, she said she'd tell me through e-mail or phone call. That's why, it's weird that she even came here. Can you meet her and try talking to her? Rihito, please. I... If there's something I can do for her... ...I honestly think I'd go to meet her. But... Sorry, Brother. I'm different now. Huh? - Are you stupid? - Huh? I'm different now. - Here. - Okay. - By the way, Mom. - Hmm? Do you have a secret which you don't tell Dad? Well, I have 1, 2, or around 5 of that. But I guess he also keeps secrets from me. Huh? What did you say? Nothing at all~ Is it something about Yuto which makes you worried? No, it's not like that. Actually, I already knew about the secret... ...Yu-chan tried so hard to keep from me. Yu-chan don't know about that. I just wonder what should I do about that? Hmm? You always say nothing... ...and keep smiling all the time. I think it's so great of you. I love that kind of Fumi-chan~ Thank you, Mom! Yay~ What? Yukie-san! What? What? You came here for the lesson? Tami's rebellious phase is finally coming! - Sorry? - She said it's better if I'm not around. And my mother-in-law said that she's tired of me. Why can you say such things with a happy face? Ah, but I'm so happy! Why don't you tell me earlier? Of course it's to see your surprised face, Yaeko-chan! Geez, you've seen it, right? Right? Like this. Like this. Um, excuse me. There's something I'd like to ask you both. - Yes? - Yes? Actually last week, Kuzumi-sensei called... ...and said that she wanted to stop teaching here. She has asked a replacement teacher to come this month... ...to take over her classes. After that... ...I can't get a hold of her at all. - Rihito-kun. - Hello. Long time no see. When was our last meeting before? I can't remember. Long time no see. So... Did Mao-san tell you that she wanted to stop teaching before? No. She said she wanted to work hard as performing musician. She said that after the concert, she gained confidence somehow. Huh? It's not like that. Mao-sensei... ...couldn't perform at all. What? I went to watch her by chance. At that concert. Sensei stopped playing in the middle. The other musicians and the audience were wondering what happened to her. Ah... Could it be that she has some kind of disease with her hand? Yes, since she was studying abroad until now. Because of that, she stopped and went back here. Seems like it's recurring. - I didn't know about that... - But her treatment seems to go well. Thanks to that, she seems to be hopeful recently. - Ah. - What? Mao-sensei... ...wanted to hand over her violin to me. - What? - What does it mean? She said that she let go of it... ...because she wanted to buy a new one. But... ...it's because she quits playing violin. Anyway, let's go now. Rihito-kun, you know where her house is, right? Ah, yes. That bus stop. What should we do? Should we try to call her first? But Shono-san couldn't reach her by phone. - That's what he told you both, right? - You're right. Well, for now, let's go there. Let's go to her house and try talking with her there. Wait. If the three of us go to her place... ...I wonder how her face would be. Huh? Perhaps, what she needs now... ...is someone who understands... ...all about her past and present after she lost everything... ...but still can accept her despite of that. I think it's you. It's no one but you. That's why, now... ...I think you should go there alone, Rihito-kun. Huh? But if I go to Mao-san's place alone now... ...it will just create another impression. It's not like that. I... - Now, about you... - It's all... ...universal love. What? It's not always love or romantic feeling. The thing we have among us. 'We' doesn't mean only the three of us. Mao-sensei is included too. We are... ...connected by the universal love. Love song might still be a love song... ...but it means 'love for people' instead. Right? We have this thing called love among us, right? We have a very passionate feeling right here, right? We do. But Yaeko-chan... See? That's great. This kind of relationship is really the best. Yeah. 'Love and peace', right? Don't be kidding in such timing! - I... - I hate that. She's someone... ...you kept thinking about for at least... ...a quarter of your life, right? I hate it if you won't go to comfort her... ...while knowing that she's now... ...having her hardest time. Moreover... ...if you don't go now... ...and you can't meet Mao-sensei again after this... ...I'm sure that... ...you'll regret it for the rest of your life, Rihito-kun. It will be tough, perhaps. I like Mao-sensei's violin... ...and Mao-sensei's violin has saved me. Now, the one who is drowning and unable to breathe... ...is Mao-sensei. That's why... ...I want you to go there and save her. By the way, Yaeko-chan. If... Only if, okay? Yes. If Rihito-kun asks you to go out with him, what will you do? - I'll do it. - What an immediate reply. Because I don't know anymore if after this... ...anyone would ask me to go out, right? Moreover, for someone who's nearly 30 like me, having a charming guy 8 years younger... ...asking to go out with me like that... ...would be a completely delusional, fantasy-like story, right? - Ah, yeah. - But if in reality... ...such thing really happens, I can't possibly ignore it, right? Even though God would announce that we'd break up in 3 days... ...I will still go out with him. Then why? Why did you tell Rihito-kun to go to Mao-sensei's place just now? He is... ...a gloomy person. He isn't honest. He has sharp tongue, and despite of being outspoken, he's good for nothing. His words and deeds are too youthful... ...that seeing him always makes me goes like, "What a pain". But... But... ...even though it's unbearable for him, he watches over other people. He's very kind. He's someone who can't ignore... ...people who are in trouble. Yeah. I don't want him... ...to lose that part of himself. Mao-san. Mao-san, are you okay? It hurts. What's wrong? My chest... ...hurts. What? Yukie-san, what on earth is this? I'm still 28, but am I getting a heart attack? - That's bad, right? - What are you saying? What's wrong? It hurts... What the... um, Yaeko-chan? Seriously, is there something wrong... Yukie-san, it hurts. What is this? What on earth is this? It's weird. What is this? I hate this, really. It's painful... I... ...can't breathe... I've told you, right? You're such a fool, Yaeko-chan. Yukie-san... Perhaps this is how it feels to cling to someone in tears. All the cells in my body... ...actually said, "Don't go". Mao-san.
