LA GOMERA, CANARY ISLANDS What's wrong? Someone's hauling ass down the road. Where are they going? - Do you want to ask them? - I do. Perfect. Where the hell are they? There. Son of a bitch! Faster. Drive faster. Vehicle, red BMW. License plate... Seven... No, not seven. One... Fuck! Don't worry, you'll make it home to your daughters. Anglada, don't go in there. No, wait. No, no! No, no, no! Anglada, stop! Anglada, for God's sake, stop! Stop, that's an order! Brezo 10, this is Brezo 12. Do you copy? Yeah, we lost the BMW at Laguna Grande. BASED ON THE NOVEL "MIST AND THE MAIDEN" BY LORENZO SILVA MIST AND THE MAIDEN Civil Guard, La Gomera. Yes. Go ahead. ANONYMOUS WITNESS: SAW MALE DRIVER ABANDON RED BMW AT 2 A.M. ON ROAD TO CEMETERY AND MANIPULATE LOCK... CGO to Brezo 12. 1791... Bravo, Echo, Hotel. Can you check who owns a car for me? Here's the license plate: B- E-H. Siso! The car belongs to Gomez-Padilla. Siso. Gomez-Padilla, the councilman. His blood? Call Nava. We'll keep you posted. Thank you, Mr. Padilla. - Can you close the gate? - Yes. Should we ask around to see if anyone saw the councilman passed out drunk? No. Before accusing Padilla, we need to find out whose blood it is. Understand? I'll confirm that he took his wife's car to the party dinner and had too much to drink. Okay, go on. - Hi. - Hi. Over here! Dad, dad! Dad, I'm sorry. Dad... Dad... Dad, I'm sorry! Dad! Dad! You son of a bitch! Go to hell! Dad... THREE YEARS LATER The case has been dead for over three years. Still nobody guilty? There was, but he was acquitted. Well, they want someone to pay for it. The orders are to investigate again. The island company? No, Central Ops. They say La Gomera screwed it up. So we have to be at their disposal. No, not you. Her. Why do they want you, Anglada? I don't know, sir. I'm one of the people who "screwed it up. " You'll report to Sergeant Bevilacqua - and Corporal Chamorro. - Virginia Chamorro? Yes, does that matter? No, we were at the Academy together. They arrive tomorrow. Go catch up. Yes, sir. Hi. Good morning. Here. This is Ivan Lopez Von Amsberg. That's our Victim? He's going to town on her. I feel like missing the flight. The Incredible Hulk strikes again. Nothing I can't handle. He's jealous of us going to the Canary Islands. - How many days? - Ten. Guys with superpowers... The bigger the jerk, the higher the maintenance. True. Don't call him the Incredible Hulk. It's insulting. Can you get me one like yours? TENERIFE, CANARY ISLANDS That's her. What's up? Virgig Virgi, baby, long time no see. - Ruth. - How are you? Sergeant Bevilacqua, Corporal Anglada. - Sir. - Corporal. Thanks for picking us up. You're welcome. Careful. First we need to know if you really want to help us. Why wouldn't I? Everything's easier with a real volunteer. I know how to say no, sir. Perfect. You look beautiful. - Did you lighten your hair? - No. Ivan was like lots of kids here who stay on the island after high school because they're not smart or brave enough to leave. Even to get in trouble somewhere else. What kind of trouble? Pot, pills, coke... - And minors. - Were there other minors? None that we heard about. - Well, one would be enough. - What? You saw the video. It's a good reason to kill him. Yeah, if someone did that to my daughter, I might start slitting throats too. I don't think you'd let someone like that near your daughter. That's what a dad is for, right? In fact, Padilla's lawyer had no trouble convincing the jury that Ivan was a junkie and a rapist. What do you think, Sergeant? Is Padilla guilty or innocent? I don't know. I only ask questions. We use the answers to compose a story... You set him off. That might end up telling us who and why. Then others decide the punishment. I don't like to punish. I like my job. I won't waste it dispensing justice. Great. But you must have an opinion. Yeah, the councilman had the right lawyer. - He's not a councilman anymore. - No? Now he's Vice President. He got promoted. Pick a spot and stare at it. And breathe. Thanks. Can I ask why you picked me? Why not someone on the island? I didn't pick you. You didn't? The victim's mother asked for you. - Another one? - For La Gomera, Sergeant. Damn. Vila. - What? - Call me Vila. Vila. Vila, should people know we're coming? Well, our people know. I don't mean our people. One of them you already know. She was in the car when they arrested you. But don't worry, it's good for us that she's here. - They can't do anything to me? - No. Vice President. Julia says I shouldn't be worried. That I can't stand trial twice for the same crime. - That's true. - I can, however, sue the Civil Guard for harassment. That's an option. Do what you must, but we're here to find out who killed Ivan and that would prove your innocence. My innocence was proven at the trial. No. You were declared not guilty. It's not the same. - This is better for you. - Are you saying - I'm no longer a suspect? - No. How can I convince you otherwise? By telling us where you were between 12 and 4 that night. Passed out drunk in an abandoned lot. I look at you and it's hard to imagine. Because you think highly of me. Does anyone here not? Lots of people. Twenty years in politics. Anyone unhappy about your promotion? I know who my enemies are and none of them are capable of something like this. Vice President, sir, we need to talk to your daughter. What for? - Obviously... - What do you think? You didn't let us question her. She was a minor. We were protecting her. That's right, poor thing. Or are you protecting yourselves? - What the fuck are you insinuating? - Her statement can help you. If the boy had her consent... Consent? She was 14 years old! - Juan Luis... - You're right. You're right. - But it's important that we speak to her. - No. - What if I say please? - No. Three years, the same insinuations, the same questions, and I'll have to settle for being not guilty. - Gentlemen. - Have a good day. Anglada. Not like that. Got it? - What's up? - Hello. - Bad boy! - Hey, beautiful. What's up? How are you? Anglada. How's my favorite... Sergeant? - What's up? - It's great to see you. The Academy made a woman out of you! Yeah, and worse things. How was your trip? We just got chewed out at City Hall. - Padilla's love keeps us busy. - Welcome, Ruth. How are you? Fucking awesome, sir. Nice manners they taught her at the Academy. Good for her. Bevilacqua? You're Bevilacqua? Well? What did we miss 3 years ago? The phone tip on Padilla's BMW. Anything odd about it? He whispered. I insisted he identify himself, especially when he said they were simulating a robbery, but he hung up. We found the cell phone he used, but it belonged to a tourist who had lost it. Thank you. Do you remember his accent? From here. Not too strong, but from here. The day Padilla was arrested, those present were Lieutenant Nava, Corporal Berto and privates Sanchez and Crespo. - Sanchez? - Crespo's in Madrid. With the Digital Crime Unit. And you showed Padilla the video of his daughter. The judge. To explain why we were arresting him. How did he react? Very badly. Like it was the first time he'd seen it? Probably. Why else would he leave it there to incriminate him? Do you think he recognized Ivan? Here in La Gomera, he'd be hard to miss. If he didn't know, someone would tell him. It looks like a strong case. Ivan's blood was in Padilla's car, no alibi, and Ivan's relationship with his daughter was a motive to kill him. It's too bad they never found the informant. Or the weapon, or his belongings, or where he was killed. The case wasn't ready for trial. And none of her friends contradicted the version that Ivan raped her? When we arrested Padilla, all the locals refused to let us question their daughters. Did you consider other possibilities? Anglada said he took drugs. You think he got killed over two joints and they used the councilman to cover it up? No, sir. I thought that if Padilla was a dead end, you might have looked elsewhere. Look, there might be a thousand ways in Madrid to solve a crime, but here in La Gomera, there's only one. In my opinion, Padilla killed the kid, period. You're right, sir. There's only one way: the right way. Here and in Madrid. Believe me. That's why it's so hard. Give me a break. You're here because we did a bad job. Yes or no? No. We're here because the victim's uncle is a deputy in the European parliament and pressured our superiors to reopen the case. Okay, that clarifies everything. We put on a show for the mother. Let's get to work. When they send us, the orders are to solve the case. To try. You keep doing it. - Doing what? - Defending me. If I disrespect him, let him come after me. - You didn't disrespect him. - Yes, I did. And remember, I'm not an officer or a man. What's that got to do with it? Give me a break. I have to explain the rules of the game to you? Fine, if that helps... Yes, Sergeant Vila. I think they told you we were coming. No, they said Sergeant Bevilacqua. Yes, it's the same person. Why don't you call him by his name? Who are you? Like I said before, Corporal Chamorro. What if Padilla didn't kill Ivan? I think he didn't know him or what he was doing with his daughter. Why do you think that? The autopsy said the cut came from behind. A precise cut from left to right. That takes cold blood. One, if you're fucking a girl, you don't let her dad get that close. And two, knowing Padilla, I don't think he could be that cold-blooded. What if he went crazy and attacked him by surprise? Yeah, probably. But as long as we're here, let's look where the others didn't. I'd rather you didn't come, Corporal. Why, sir? The mother said you were the only one who worried about her and her son. - I'd rather we see her alone, all right? - Okay. You're three years late. You're absolutely right. Were there more girls? No, only her. Are you sure? Ivan could bring anyone home he wanted. They're in his room. Why Desiree? Because she's pretty, has a nice ass... - Ivan didn't tell me. - In your opinion? - She wasn't a little girl. - She was 14. How old were you when you lost your virginity? I was 13. Ivan wasn't her first man. I'm not stupid. Ivan isn't perfect, but he's not a monster or a rapist. Ivan had disappeared for three days. Why didn't you report him missing? - He had his own life. - Who did you think he was with? With Udo, working, with his friends... I'm going to need their names. Excuse me. Could I see his room? Yes. It's the second door - on the left. - Thank you. - Who is Udo? - Udo is a friend. He organizes excursions around the island. Ivan worked with him. WHY RECORD IT ON HER PHONE? I'm sorry, I only wanted to see if it worked. Did you give it to him? I paid for part of it, Ivan the rest with his savings. Did you notice if Ivan had more money than normal before he was killed? No, I didn't notice anything. Look, I'm not judging if Ivan was good or bad. Since I was assigned the case, I'm on his side. Really. Where do you think he got the money? I already answered you. If you don't believe me, that's your problem. Hi. Thank you. Thank you for coming back. You're welcome. Look, I was spoiled as a child and I spoiled my son. I could have raised him better, set limits... You didn't fail your son. Somebody came along and killed him. That's it. After all this time, who do you think did it? I thought Padilla, but I don't know anymore. I've been trying to find out for 3 years, but no one will talk to me. My whole life here, I'm still the German to them. For me they're all guilty, but only one of them killed him. And you've come here to find him. Please, do it. Anglada. Could you follow orders from now on? The Yamaha is worth 24,000 euros. I'd like to confirm that the mother gave him the money. Okay. If not, where did it come from? Drugs? There are a couple of dealers on the list she gave you. I can ask Bam Bam about it. Who? He's a police informant. Want me to ask headquarters if he's still active? And ask for help locating Ivan's friends. Which of the two do you think told someone? - I think he did. - Because he was behind her? - No, because he was fucking a 14 year old. - Exactly, it was her. She was fucking a 20 year old and recorded it. Why is this important? Because the murderer must have known about the video. He used it to implicate Padilla. If it was her, we need to ask her who she told. - When the VP lets us. - Okay, meanwhile let's find out who knew about the video - and see where Ivan's money leads. - Okay. Wait. It being recorded on her phone doesn't mean he didn't tell anyone about it. She might have sent him a copy. I'll go to headquarters before the others leave. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. See you tomorrow, Virgi. Are we going to have a problem? Good question. Are we? It's been over three years. We probably won't find anything. It won't be easy, that's for sure. Go ahead. Yes? Wait. Have you thought that finding the murderer might not be the best thing we can do for Margarethe? She won't leave until we do. Right. Yeah. No, I was busy. Yeah, it's fine. He's asleep, Ruben. Yeah. Should I call him tomorrow at 8? No, he has school tomorrow. Oh, that's right. How about in the evening? Yeah, here at home. Then I'll call him in the evening. Okay, I'll tell him. - Goodbye. - Bye. Come in. We need you to locate these people. Is Bam Bam still working for you? The Sergeant thinks it wasn't Padilla. We're going to suppose it wasn't and the killer used the video to incriminate him. - And the drugs? - Ivan had a lot of money. That could be the source. Very well. Bam Bam's in El Risco. We'll find the others for you. Sit down. Tell me. How's it going? How are you? Again? Fucking awesome. Don't bullshit me, I know you. I don't believe you. Didn't take you long to tell Carmen I was coming. As soon as you set foot on the island. And you put her at the door to keep an eye on me. No, we had an appointment for an ultrasound. - It's a boy. - Congratulations. But do me a favor. Tell your wife I didn't come back to fuck her husband. What about Vila? Are you going to fuck him? Is that an order, Lieutenant? H ey- What? What are you going to do? Get to work. Hello, good morning. Udo? Yes. Margarethe asked us for money to buy the house in La Gomera. I don't think she could afford such an expensive motorcycle. I talked to her, she liked you. I got the impression she can't take it much longer. I think she'd be better off with her family. Ivan is her family. And I'd like you to bring them back to Germany. Ivan worked with Udo the morning of the day he was killed, preparing for a dive. He left around 10:30 and he didn't see him again. Did he pay him well? 100 euros per dive plus tips, it wouldn't cover the motorcycle. His mom's money wouldn't either. - Did Udo know about the video? - No. He didn't even know Ivan was seeing the girl. They didn't get along well. Ivan was a mess. He smoked joints at work. He almost killed a customer once - by not checking a respirator. - Damn. He probably put up with him because Margarethe and Udo were lovers. Okay, Udo and the kid didn't get along. - Does killing him make sense? - No. No. Any news from Germany? Well, Margarethe liked me. Where can we find Desiree's friends? Right now? At the high school. Let's talk to them, see if we find out anything. Without their parents' permission? Excuse me. Can I have a stogie? - A what? - A cigarette. Sure, I didn't understand your slang. Thanks. Who are you? Virginia, and you? Me? Yumara. Yumara's a pretty name. You're not a lesbian, are you? No. I'm a scout for Real Madrid. - Yeah, right. - Sure. What's the left center's name? Who? The one in the blue shorts. That's Tomas Trujillo. Is he good? He's handsome. Is he your boyfriend? No, he's a fucking kid. You're right, he's not your type. Damn, Ruth! - We missed you. - Here I am. - You're skinnier. - You too, bastard. Ivan bought garbage for the price of gold. Thanks, bro. - But he wasn't loaded. - Thanks. You're welcome. We already know he was using. Why didn't you tell me he was dealing? Dealing? Ivan wasn't dealing. Then who did he steal all that money from? Nobody I know of. Then he didn't make it dealing. Not as far as I know. I think you're ashamed to tell me. Me, ashamed? You know I can't lie, my old lady will wash out my mouth with soap. Don't bring up your mother while talking about drugs. Damn it, Ruth. You know people here sell pot, hash... For stronger stuff, they go to Tenerife. And Ivan never did. Well, then? Maybe he got it from a friend. That's all I know, I can lie if you want. No, we don't want to upset your mother. - Hey, this is tasty. - Thanks. Does she make it? She passed away, Sergeant. Wow, I'm sorry. - And you aren't scared? - Scared? Scared of what? That Ivan's murderer will find out you know more than you're saying and come looking for you. Hell yes, Sergeant. I don't even know who it is. Then I think you'd better tell us who got Ivan the drugs. Anyone on this list? Zoilo and Cristo. No time to eat. - Want some? - No, you eat it. Desiree didn't show her friends the video. They knew she was fucking him, but not that they'd recorded it. - You think Ivan told someone? - I don't know. But when he was killed, they'd already broken up. Which makes no sense, because they made the video only days before he died. Did she tell her friends why they broke up? Only that she dumped him. Do any of them still hang out with her? No, they lost touch when her dad moved her off the island. Cristo, you bought drugs for Ivan, right? Yeah, sometimes I bought for friends in Tenerife and brought it back on weekends. But everyone paid their share, including Ivan. I didn't make a profit. Did Ivan tell you where he got the money for drugs? I imagine from his mom. - How is she? - Bad. His mom is bad. - Go and see her sometime. - Yeah. Yeah, I should. What did Ivan say about Padilla's daughter? Nothing to me. I found out after - he was killed. - Then who did he tell? Antonio Mainou is in Hermigua, Lucas Barate is in Las Hayas. Where should we start? Take your pick. They're both the same distance. The road with the least curves. Why did you join the Civil Guard? Nothing original. I decided to go into the family business. My dad's an officer. And what does he think of his daughter's vocation? He's not fucking amused at all. We don't get along very well. Because first I studied physiotherapy and then I joined the Civil Guard, and he didn't like it. So he started making my life impossible. Then when I finished at the Academy, I requested Afghanistan just to piss him off. You can imagine how he took it. No wonder. Afghanistan is a fucked up destination. You served there? For a while. I didn't go in the end. So I ended up in Orense, in Civilian Safety, for two years. Totally fucking boring. Then I joined Narcotics, in the Costa da Morte, with Nava. I didn't know you'd worked together. Yeah, that was... tough, very dangerous, but it was awesome. Then one day Navas asked for a transfer to the Canary Islands and later on we coincided here. You? That motorcycle's been following us since we left the hotel. Follow him. - Watch out. - Fuck! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Son of a bitch! Stop! Civil Guard! Stop! Vila! Vila! Don't move. Show me your hands! - I didn't do anything! - Vila! Turn around and take off your helmet. Slowly. Slowly! - Slowly. - You ran into me, damn it. Are you okay? - Yeah. - What's your name? Yerai. Why are you following us, Yerai? I wasn't following anyone. From the hotel. Why? If I tell you, I'll lose money. Then you'll lose it. Why? - My aunt asked me to. - Who's your aunt? - Rosa. - Rosa who? Rosa Chinea. Zoilo's sister. Chamorro's with him. Mr. Chinea? Mr. Chinea! I asked around and nobody's seen them today. Bingo. Yeah. Wait. Hold this. One... There... Three... And another one, here's another one. The number you're calling is either turned off or out of range. She was supposed to call me. Then she'll call you. Tell me what you had to do. Tell her what you did, who you went to see and all that. Did she mention anyone in particular? No. If I'd known you were cops, I would have said no. Not cops, grunts. It's not the same thing. - What's in it for you? - 500 bucks to fix up my bike. Damn, you're out of luck. Sorry. Don't worry, Candelaria. Take the boy home - and go easy on him. - Thanks. - Are you finished? - Yeah. Come and give your mom a hug, you son of a bitch. Miguel said this is about the German lady's kid. - Yeah, he was friends with Zoilo. - Yeah, but more with Rosa. He was always at her house. If he was in business, it was with her. When you find my cousin, tell her if she goes near my son I'll kill her. You hungry? - Yeah. - Let's go. I don't know. Maybe Ivan pissed them off with his flashy bike - or using the product. - But nobody knew he was selling, not even you. That's true. Let's say Ivan's murder was related to the Chinea's drugs. Why go after Padilla? Well, drug money has to be laundered by a legal business. Padilla was a politician, he had power. Maybe he didn't play ball. - Any threats on record? - No. But even if there had been, the Chineas wouldn't be scared because it wasn't their money, - it was their bosses'. - And who are they? If they work with Tenerife, the Russian mafia or the Lebanese. We'd have to ask Narcotics on the island. Hi. Okay, the Chineas took the ferry yesterday to Tenerife, then flew to Manchester. They're your fugitives for drug smuggling. I need you to let me look for them for Ivan's death too. Of course. - Why leave the drugs behind? - So everyone knows where it is. It's easier to deal with us than explain it to their bosses while getting beaten with a hammer. By the way, Vila. You're bleeding. - What? - Your back. Damn, you are. Vila. If it's okay with you, I'm going to Madrid to tell our people at Europol about the Chineas. I can be back tomorrow night or the next day. O K3)'- Not long enough to calm the Hulk, but it's up to you. Why don't you come too? Andres will be happy to see you. No, I'm going to stay. I don't know. We haven't answered a single question we had at the beginning. Maybe they weren't the right questions. Maybe. But if I have to tell Margarethe her son was killed because he was a dealer and an idiot, I want to be sure. We can have breakfast at Casa Pano and then shop for baby clothes. Okay, it's a date. - Perfect. - How many are we? - There are nine of us. - Nine, right? Yeah. If you don't mind, I'm going to fondle my wife. Go ahead, she looks so pretty even I would. Look who scored. And your daughter has good taste. Lettuce. Lettuce for Spiderman? No, that's Federico's. No lettuce for Spiderman? No, Spiderman doesn't eat, he only fights. Spiderman only fights? Then the salad for the other one. What's his name? Francisco? Of course I know the kid has a schedule. - I'm not on vacation here. - I know. But he asks me and I tell him. Fine, Gabriela. Fine. Goodbye. All right, goodbye. You want one? Thanks. Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop. My son's mother. We've been separated four years. I think she still likes to bust my balls. She tells Andres about my cases, about murders. - She does? - I don't like it. My dad used to tell me about his. With all the gory details. But I loved it. - It didn't give you nightmares? - Yeah. What did your father tell you? Not much. I remember watching him paint toy Soldiers for hours. They were for me. In silence. Toy Soldiers? Listen to Carmen, study Engineering. I want to be a Civil Guard - like Uncle Miguel. - Not again! Not like me, like your father. No way. She knows her stuff. An officer. - Right, sweetie? - Keep it up. You can do both. You join the Civil Guard and meanwhile you get a degree. There's time, if you're organized. - What did you study? - Psychology. Must be useful to understand the bad guys. Yeah, sometimes. What sucks is when you realize everyone's disturbed. Yeah? You too? More than you know. What about me? I still don't know how much, Corporal Anglada. That's bull. If you studied, why are you only a Sergeant? - You can't fool her! - She's gorgeous. - That's mine. Thanks. - Thank you. What if I buy you a drink? One more drink and I'll fall asleep standing up. It's too bad you're so decent, Sergeant. No, it's too bad I'm your sergeant. So, you're a college boy, a psychologist, which means you're smart at least... At times. But you joined the Civil Guard, which is strange. You served in Afghanistan and now at Central Operations. I don't get it. Why do you think? That you like it rough. That you like being near the action. Not a bad profile at all. Look, I'm a Sergeant because I'm great at following orders. You've got this teacher's pet thing going... It's hilarious. But I'm good at getting others to follow orders too. Ch, yeah? - You know what I think? - What? That you're very formal on the outside, but down deep, there's something very dark. I'm Sergeant Dark? I'm a Sergeant because I think what matters happens in the street. That's where you can make a difference, not in an office. What? I also think you're a good person. And you? Are you a good person? "Spiderman doesn't eat, he only fights. " Vila. What's going on? Sorry, I woke you. Yeah. It's just... It's something Nava's daughter said. What? Look. Since you only see Spiderman fighfing, you can't imagine him eating too, but of course he does. - Yeah. - He has to. Okay, what do you see? An adult man fucking a young girl. It even looks like he's raping her, that's what we see. But imagine you're Desiree and you know that no one will see it but you - and your boyfriend. - Yeah. Then what is this? Nothing but a girl giving herself to the man she loves. There's nothing dark about it. Even if he grabs her hair, the position... We can't see love but that doesn't mean it's not there. Hold on. Desiree's friends said - she dumped him. - Okay. What if she cared about him and lied to them to protect that? It wasn't a secret. The murderer knew it. I think he didn't know. He was lucky you found it and it was perfect to implicate Padilla, but he didn't know. I lied to Margarethe. I was never on Ivan's side. I never saw him the way Desiree or she did. When Ivan was born and they put him on my breast, I knew there would never be another man in my life. He was so tiny, so perfect. One day we were planting flowers and he was six years old. He took my hand all serious and said that I was a better than average mother. That he'd always love me. I don't know where he heard that, but he kept his word every day of his life. That painting? He gave it to me. He was very handsome. Yeah, gorgeous. You didn't give him the money. He paid for the motorcycle himself. Why did you lie to me? Where did he get the money? The painting at the hotel. You sold it so you could stay here, right? He was supporting you, not the other way around. He was a good son. Margarethe, where did he get the money? Did he mention Rosa Chinea? He never told me their names. Never. Their names? What names? I could have done something, but I didn't know. Margarethe, look at me. I did everything wrong! If you don't tell me, I can't find the murderer. Look at me. It's my fault they killed him, I didn't make him stop. Make him stop what? Margarethe, stop what? My son supported me letting people fuck him. Is that what you need to know? Good evening. Hey! Please, don't... Don't screw me. Hello? Damn it, Carlos... Let's go, come on out. Efi, Carlos... I don't know who Ivan fucked. Ivan arranged the day and time. I only came when he and his customer were already aboard. When they were done, Ivan would ask me to return to port. I'd go and then they'd leave after me. He never told you anything? I never asked. That's how the business worked. But you told his mom what her son was doing. Yeah, to help her. Was Ivan going out the night he was killed? Ivan hadn't done business here for months. Then why did he come? He wanted to know if the boat was occupied. Yes. Did Ivan know who you'd rented it to? He didn't tell me. Since the system hadn't changed, you didn't know who had hired him. This is all legal, they only pay me to rent the boat. I want your ship's log. Look, here it is. December 3rd, left at 1:46, returned at 3:12. This would take apart Padilla's alibi. But it's only one trip. Let's look for more. Look. Padilla attended a meeting in Agulo on November 4th, 2009. There's a trip from 12 to 2. January 20th, 2010. On January 20th Udo was out from 10 until 11:15, a little over an hour. Who could he have been with? I don't know. You're not jealous of the VP? I am. Vice President, sir. - What can I do for you? - Nothing. I came to say I've proven your innocence. - Great, I'm glad. - Me too. - And I need to talk to your daughter. - That's not going to happen. Sorry, let me clarify. You didn't kill Ivan. You were on a cruise. How do you want to do this, sir? His daughter is studying in Tenerife. There's a flight from Madrid in 3 hours. If you catch it, you'll arrive a little before us. If you can make it today. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah? How did you convince Padilla? I told him I found out he was more into boats than lots. - I'll tell you later. - Okay, bye. I'll see you soon. Bye. - I have a favor to ask. - Go ahead. When we're on duty, let's pretend this didn't happen. Don't worry, I wasn't going to say anything. Has Virginia told you why she's angry with me? No. Because I got in her bed. At the Academy. I liked her a lot, but she didn't like me. And she kicked me out. I don't think I should go to Tenerife. She'll realize. O K3)'- O K3)'- And I need... I need to stop wanting to fuck you... Sergeant. You can tell her that you need to see the girl with new eyes. Right? Everything okay in Madrid? Now that I broke up with him, yes. I don't know. He's a big guy, SÍFOn9... He's green... You sure he isn't the man of your dreams? You want me to question Desiree or do you want to? You do it. Wait there, I'll bring her out. O K3)'- I met him in a nightclub. He was tall, handsome and generous. I liked him and we fucked. What do you mean by generous? If he had money, he paid and if he had drugs, he shared. - Did he say where he got it? - Don't answer that. - Did he ever take you on the boat? - No. Ivan didn't want to. He said that was work and with me it was different. Why? Because at work you do as you're told, and with me he could do what he wanted. Did Ivan ever say - who he worked with? - Don't you dare. Maybe I should ask you. Only about my client's relationship with Ivan. Desiree. You and Ivan had plans the day he was killed, right'? We had plans. Why? If you'd broken up. Because he was going to leave the island and... we wanted to say goodbye. Why wasn't he taking you with him? Because I didn't want to go. I was just a kid, you know. But I knew he wouldn't come. I saw him on his motorcycle with another girl. And it wasn't me. Would you recognize the other girl if you saw her? She was wearing a helmet. What time was it? - In the afternoon, after school. - Could it be Rosa Chinea? That's enough. One more question. Why did you make the video? I wanted him to have something to remember me by. But you never sent it to him. No. You recorded it with yours, it was for him... Why did it stay on your phone? I wouldn't want it on his, with all the other women. Where have you got the Chinea stuff? You don't know? - The Chinea stuff, where? - Downstairs. She doesn't remember her. And she doesn't think she was one of his clients. - And the one on his bike? - Not her either. She says the one on his bike wasn't such a cow. Then what are you going to do? Vila. One second. - Yes. - Really? Wow, Padilla just gave us permission to take Desiree to La Gomera. We'll see if she recognizes anyone who was on Ivan's phone. Not the most brilliant plan in the world, but it's a start. When are you coming? On tomorrow's first ferry. Ask Nava to send someone to pick us up. Desiree's scared and her parents - must be terrified. - Yeah, sure. Vila, I'm scared too. Why? I miss you. Sorry, it slipped out. See you tomorrow, okay? Bye. Perfect, bye. Yes? Carmen, it's Anglada. Can you get Nava, please? He can't talk right now. Okay, please tell him that Sergeant Bevilacqua's coming tomorrow with Padilla's daughter and they'll need an escort for protection, okay? Hold on, I'll put him on. Yes? They killed Anglada, Sergeant. They killed her. Where is she? The judge had the body taken away. What happened? It looks like a car hit her, broke both her legs, she tried to crawl away, and once she got there, the car ran her over again. Do you know what she was doing here? - Excuse me? - What was she doing here? She called me to prepare an escort for Padilla's daughter, then she went to the hotel. Why the fuck did they kill her? Why? Someone didn't want to be identified by the girl. Or retaliation for the drugs. She might have found out something while we were in Tenerife. I don't know. I have no idea who might have killed her. You can't think of anything? I can't even imagine it. Look at me. Bam Bam, look at me. Look at me. I know that you know a lot of things. Just give me something to solve Anglada's murder. - I don't want to join her. - I know. Of course not. I'm asking you, please. Why did they kill Ruth? Remember the girl on the motorcycle? How could we forget? She was out of this world. Tight jeans, perfect ass, and those boots... Ivan was no fool, man. And her tits... Okay, great body. Did he say who she was? No. Did he tell you? No, I didn't know he was seeing anyone. No. - But he must have liked her. - Why? - She was driving his bike. - Yeah, that's right. Ivan never let anyone touch his bike. Or even look at it. He was nuts about her. He must have really been into her to let her drive, otherwise... - You think? - Of course. Sergeant Bevilacqua. Put on gloves. I think there was another reason he let her drive. - Will I get in trouble? - No. Well, yeah, if you don't tell me. - They killed Ivan. - Because of her? He let her drive because - she was helping him leave. - Were they leaving together? She was going to give him the money. How is that related to his death? Ivan said she was the Mambo King's girl. Who? The guy who gave Ivan all the awesome drugs he shared. Does this king have a name? The Mambo King? What do you know about him? That he must be a nasty son of a bitch. Vila. I know who killed her. Why? So what? You killed her because of this garbage? This fucking crap? She came here to tell me Ivan was dead. - She killed him and hugged me. - How do you know? - This only proves she slept with him. - I asked her and she lied. How do you know? You don't know! Who sent you the video? She murdered him and hugged me. Margarethe, who sent you the video? I have nothing more to say. Take her away. Turn around. Come with me. The video was sent from a stolen cell phone. Who might have it? If Anglada was the Mambo King's girl, maybe him? It's possible. They hand us Ivan's murderer so we'll stop looking for him. Anglada served with you. Do you think she was capable of murder? She could do anything. But murder... I don't know what to think. I need the numbers Anglada called. And those that called her. - Since we got here. - I'll request them. I'll see you at the hotel. Bam Bam, this will be easy. Your mom won't be angry. Anglada told you we were coming. What did she tell you to say? Nothing, just to pick a name on the list. Zoilo Chinea. And why Cristo? That was me, to make it more real. More real? She called you and the number in red. - It's a local. - Civil Guard headquarters. It all fits. The anonymous informant, Anglada being present for the pursuit... Even framing Padilla. I just don't know how to prove it. Call Madrid. Tell them not to go home. Fine, I'm stuck with the mess. What are we looking for? Why the Mambo King left the Costa da Morte to come to La Gomera. Corporal Chamorro. Here. It's dirty, but it's the only way to get to him. - Then I'll handle it. - No, I'll do it. I need to get off this island. I'll look for Siso at headquarters. How will you convince him? They lied to us for a few days, they lied to him for 3 years. I'll think of something. - Want to go to the bathroom? - Yes. Come on. Are you taking Luis? - Yes. - Okay. We'll be right back. - May I? - Sure. What the fuck are you doing here? I need to close out a few details. Anyway, thank you. You helped us get this far. These are your merits in the Costa da Morte. Three years heading Narcotics, over 50 successful operations... Impressive. But if you look closely, you see nothing against one mafia boss. So I wonder, what was La Gomera? They paid you off for services rendered? Careful, darling. You fooled us since we set foot on the island. Then Anglada kept us busy with the Chineas, the drugs, Bam Bam... Whatever it took. And she was convincing. Anglada was amazing, you know that. In love with her commanding officer. She'd have done anything you asked. But despite Carmen, you kept fucking her. That was your mistake. Because this is an island, and Ivan found out. And he used it to blackmail you. What did he do? Ask for money to not tell your wife? He went too far, he fucked with the Mambo King. What exactly do you want to know? I want to know who killed Ivan. You saw the video and you're still trying to save her? That they slept together doesn't prove anything. Not that she killed him. You explained it perfectly. To slit someone's throat, you have to get very close to them. You're the one he threatened. It was your money he wanted. Right? It was you driving Ivan's body. Does it suck getting replaced by someone younger? Anglada killed him. What surprises me is you've solved both crimes and you're still going around in circles. You're married to a Civil Guard. You know how this works. Anything we find about Ivan, Anglada and your husband could put you in jail. Think about your own interest. Think of Lola and your unborn baby. Did you order her to do it? Don't be stupid, I didn't order anything. Then why? Why did she kill him? Because she lost it. The kid did something he shouldn't have, she lost it and killed him. Too fucking bad. And you hand her to his mother. She kills for you, and you hand her to his mother. You've got nothing on me. You can't prove anything. How will you arrest me? How? Tell me you didn't talk to them. Tell me you didn't. They have nothing! They can take Lola away. I found the cell phone with the video. I realized Anglada was involved in Ivan's death. And that my husband knew. That he was covering it up. I was afraid to report it, so I sent the video to Margarethe. She was his mother, she had a right to know. I never imagined that she would kill her. You must have expected a drastic response. You know this little story very well. But I don't believe it. You don't flee with your daughter and the husband you're so afraid to report. I'm due in two weeks and I was going to my parents' to have my baby. You want to know what happened? Now you know. No. I don't. I know nothing. Let's start over. Why did you give Margarethe the video? You have a son. You should understand. I knew Anglada would never go away. When did you realize that? Remember the lunch at home? She wouldn't stop looking at him. She didn't care about anything. Lola, the baby, nothing. I'm the mother of his children. And she's the girl of his dreams. You couldn't bear it. And you gave her to Margarethe. My husband was the man of hers. My husband. She came back to the island for him. She killed for him. What could I do? If Nava confirms her story, Carmen will get off. Then let her get off. Let the Mambo King pay for his family. Why did Anglada go to meet the mother? She wanted to say goodbye to her son. In the middle of nowhere? Yeah, Margarethe showed us a photo of her there with him. It must have been a special place for them. Anglada should have known it was a trap. H ey- Are you and I going to be okay? Right now I could kill you. But yes. We'll be okay. Sir. I'm sorry. You'll hear terrible things about your daughter, but while under my command, she always did her duty. She was an excellent Civil Guard. Who cares? If you'd done your job right, Sergeant, my daughter would be alive. Thank you. Yeah, I'll put him on. Andres, your father. Dad, did you catch the murderer? - Yes, I did. - What are you bringing me? What am I bringing you? A samurai. I had to do a summary of "The Jungle Book. " You know what it's about? I don't remember. What's it about? A boy gets caught by wolves. Some of them want to keep him, others don't. But if they don't, he'll die. So they do. Now he has wolf brothers because he has no parents. Well, now he has the mother of the baby wolves. Then he makes friends with a bear who helps him against those who want to kill him because he's a boy and a human. The bad guys are a tiger and a snake.
