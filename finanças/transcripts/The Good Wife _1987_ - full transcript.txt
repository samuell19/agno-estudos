Mrs. Hills! Greta? Mrs. Day says to come quickly. I won't be a moment, love. Ready? How are you, Greta? Good. Don't hold onto it. - Hello, Gerry. - Thanks for coming. Hello, Sal. Mrs. Carmichael. - You all right? - Yeah. You'll be all right. Mrs. Carmichael, I'll need a sheet and clean towel, please. It's not good enough for me to deliver me own grandchildren. Now... Good. It won't be much longer now. When you start to feel the pain again, brace yourself against the bed... ...and hold the sheets like reins and push. Okay. Okay. Push. Push, Sal. Push. Okay, good. Just relax. Just wait. Come on, Sugar. Bit more axe in there. Come on, mate, get into it. You'd better not take all day, mate. Timber! Come on. It's lunch time. He's hit Ned. You all right, mate? Jesus Christ! You didn't warn him. He's all right. By the living Jesus, I'll kill the little bastard! You're lucky. You bloody little mongrel! Don't try to stand up for him. You saw what happened. I'm going to give this bastard the lesson of his life. Come on, it was just an accident. The old turd wasn't hurt. Were you? Shut up. Tell him you're sorry and you won't do anything so stupid again. Piss off! He's sorry, Ned. You can take my word for it. If its all the same, I'll handle it myself. It's not the same. I said this was the end of it. That better be enough for you. You're not doing him any favours by pampering him. You're not doing yourself any, either. You listen to me. You're damn lucky to have this job. There's 100 blokes out there that'll take it if you don't shape up. - Learn the rules and stick to them. - Bullshit! Stop pushing me around like that. If I hadn't, do you think Ned would've let it drop? Have a sandwich. I don't want none. I talked to Marge about you coming over for dinner tonight. He's just beautiful, Sal. He's got the hiccups. Congratulations. You can come in now. You okay'? It's a boy, Gerry. I think he looks like you. He looks a bit like your father, too. Around the mouth. Here, you have a hold. Bye. - His mother probably poisoned him. - I wouldn't blame her. Sal Day had a boy. Good on her. She likes the young blokes. - Yeah'? - Yeah. Years ago she knocked them-- Good tucker, love. You going down to congratulate Gerry? I think so. Wet the baby's head. I want to come, too. Just mind you don't make too much noise. Sal needs a rest. - Don't you ever get tired of playing games? - Watch it! Look what you've done. Give it to me, Sugar. Costs money. When can I come and live here full time? When would I get any peace if you lived here full time? I'd settle down. Pigs might fly. What stories are in there this week'? All sorts of interesting things. - Interesting things happen to you, too. - No, they don't. I stand by and watch them happen to others. I only help. No one would want to know me if I didn't. What a lot of rot. People around here wouldn't know what to do without you. It's getting late. Come on. Don't I get a kiss? Yeah, give her a kiss, Sugar. We won't be late. Okay- - See you, Marge. - See you, Sugar. Take some jam for Sal. All right. I can't stop thinking of Sal Day's baby. Is that what's given you the blues? I wish I had one. I wonder if it'd make any difference. What are you talking about? Sometimes it seems as if nothing exciting will ever happen to me. What do you want to have happen? I don't know. When you find out what it is, I'll get it for you. Hello, Archie. Hello, Marge. You look good enough to eat. Mum? Aren't you up yet? This dreadful head. Look what I bought you. Happy birthday, mum. It's lovely. Not that I need reminding. How's Sonny? Fine. What have you been up to'? Nothing much. Sal Day had a dear little boy. Which you delivered, of course. - Daisy. - I keep telling her... ...running around town slaving for everyone isn't going to get her anywhere. I don't do things for that reason. They're never going to forget that I'm your mother. A dreadful head, and an even worse temper. Not so bad that you didn't get what you want out of me. - And who got what out of who? - Liar. I am no liar, as well you know. Why don't you let me tidy up for you? Won't take me a jiffy. You will not. I never brought you up to be anybody's slave, certainly not my own. She just doesn't deserve you, love. I've still got some shopping to do. Ta-ta, mum. Archie. G'day, ROY- G'day, mate. How are you going? If you don't want to keep the room on, I can easily let it. No. I want to keep it on for a couple of weeks at least. There'll be more company for you up there. Of course, it'll mean a lot more work for Marge. She don't mind. Thanks. Have a good time. He'll be all right here. He'll have to be. What's the matter? Never seen a man and woman doing it before? Don't. About time you got a bit of experience yourself. Big suitcase. - It's the only one I got. - High hopes? One, two, three, four. - Cheater. - You're no good. Leave my little brother alone! Let's hide from him. Boo! What are you two up to'? Nothing. Can't trust you for a second, can I? - I got my feet all wet. - Here we go. Don't do that. Down you go. Come on, under. Why can't we do what you and Sonny do'? - Because we're not married, that's why. - Sonny might let us. Ask him. Would you like to do it? I suppose one man's much the same as another. You are. You only think you're different. Would you like to do it? Ask Sonny. You ask him. No. You're his pet. Are you ashamed to'? No. We're all like the one, aren't we'? Getting near your bedtime, isn't it? He says he wants to spend the night with me. And what did you say'? Nothing. No, you didn't. You said one man's the same as another. That's what you think, is it? - You want to find out. - Would you let me? You cheeky little bugger. It's up to you. Go on, then. Not so fast, Sugar. Wait. I'm still your bloke, am I? You'll always be my bloke. What do you want with the other fellow? Will you give him his walking papers, then? Why, you tired of him already? I thought, while he was interested, it wouldn't be as lonely. So you're lonely with me? I love you more than anyone in my life. You know that. Yeah, I believe you. Thousands wouldn't. That'll do. Did you enjoy it last night? Yeah, it was good. You're lucky, son. - Afternoon. - Hello. - Hello, Sarah. - Hello, Marge. - Hello, Ron. - Afternoon. - Has my parcel arrived yet? - I'll take a look. I believe we're expecting you. - Neville Gifford. - Ron Davis. Service in the pubs will pick up now. This is the new barman. Hello. The pub's down the main street. I'll send your bags on in the van. Marge will show you the way. Okay? Thank you. You'll find it a bit quiet here after the city. Nothing much to do. I'll think of something. You'll get a few funny looks in those smart clothes of yours. What's your hurry? What do you find to do'? I've a husband to take care of. All the best-looking girls do. Anyone ever tell you... ...you've got beautiful eyes? Then what are you teasing for? You look to me as if you know what it's all about. I'm a married woman. Give me a break. It's like I've been on the train for a month. Please, don't. The minute I saw you, I knew we were the same type. Both looking for the same thing. Am I right? Please, don't. You want me as much as I want you. Hey, listen. How about I find my room at the hotel? I'll collect you from the backsteps, okay? No! Are you Mr. Gifford'? Mrs. Jackson. How do you do'? Sorry I missed you. Where's your luggage'? They're sending the rest of it along in the van. Hello, Marge. You only get one chance with me, sweetheart. - That wiper's useless. - Yeah, it's too small. Yeah. - It's really pouring down, isn't it? - It was mud all the way from the camp. - Let's go out and eat tonight. - In the rain'? Where'? Hotel? Sit up there like dummies? I've got a real yen to go out. Once we're there, the rain won't matter. All right. I wouldn't worry, love. You'll be the best-looking woman there. Well, Mrs. Jackson, I never like to wear out a friendship. Excuse me, Mrs. Jackson. Ready for dessert, Mr. Gifford'? Yes, please. ...delayed us about three days. Never staying there again. How was that? Good, thanks. Thanks, Rosie. Got any apple pie? I'll have a look out back for you, okay? What are you looking at? Nothing. Ladies and gentlemen. Could I have your attention, please? Thank you. I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce Mr. Neville Gifford... ...who arrived today to take over the bar. He's a man of considerable experience... ...and we're very lucky to have him. I hope you will do all you can to make him feel welcome. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Jackson, that sounds like a very warm welcome indeed. I've already seen how pretty the women are... ...and tomorrow I start to see if the men are strong enough to hold their liquor. And by the looks of some of the faces, I'd say there's a strong chance they can. He's rather nice, isn't he? Excuse me. Don't smirk at the fellow, darling. I'd like one, please. - When did you start drinking? - Tonight. I just feel like it. Don't drink too much, you won't like it. I thought you weren't going to come. Silly girl. We'll see you in the morning. Look, all the rain's gone. Aren't the stars bright? They're the same as they always are. You're drunk. Yes, I might be. I've had a terrific night. So have I. I want to be with you tonight. Please don't. I thought you said everything was all right. - It is, but I just can't. - But you don't want me. - I just don't want you to spoil things. - Spoil things? I didn't mean it. Please, I didn't mean it. It's all right. Well? It suits you, Marge. Really does. What do you think? Come on, I need a man's opinion. It's all right. What's wrong with it? Makes your bum look bigger. I'll try something else. You going to be much longer? I wish I hadn't brought you. A bit small. There's something here l liked. This one. What about this one? This? Buy what you like, I don't know anything about dresses. I just want to be sure I look nice. You look nice to me without anything on. I said I was bloody sorry, all right? Good day, Sugar. Good day. How are things going out at Sonny's'? Good. Have a look at this hat I got. What's the matter with Marge? What's wrong'? It's something I said. I told her I was sorry. What did he say'? It doesn't matter. I'm disappointed I didn't see anything I liked. - I want to know what he said. -lt just slipped out. He gave someone the impression that he saw me without my clothes on. You mongrel, if I hear you talking like that again... ...I'll knock you to kingdom come! Don't fight about it! He won't say anything like that again! My oath, he won't! Once is enough. It's probably all over town. All right, but it's done! Maybe if you go back to Mrs. Gibson's. I'm not going back to Mrs. Gibson's. lf l can't stay here, I'll go somewhere else. - Where'? - To the city. - Don't talk stupid. - Bet I can have a lot of fun there. Don't take any notice of him. - Okay, ta-ta. - Don't "ta-ta" me. I'll go back to Mrs. Gibson's and pack the rest of me things. I can get a train out tonight. You're not going anywhere! Get in there! Okay, I'll go tomorrow. Grow up. I can go where l like! You'll only get into trouble if you go to the city. - And who's going to get you out of it? - I can take care of myself. Where will you go when you get there? Who do you know'? Just ignore him. If Marge doesn't want you to live here, then you can't. But if you behave yourself, you can stay for another couple of weeks. Are you going to let him blackmail you like that? I'm responsible for him. And what about your responsibility to me? You started this thing. Did I? Did I start it? Give us a beer, mate. Give us a fucking beer. Come on, give me a fucking beer. You take my advice. If you want to be considered a gentleman... ...you always follow a "fuck" with a "thank you." Where you from? Give us another fucking beer. Smart bastard. You clean up your mess and get out. I'll clean you "P. mate. He's doing your job. Give us a hand, boy. That was bloody brave of you. Thank you, Sergeant. - Neville Gifford. - Sugar Hills. It's on the house. Come on, gents. 6:00, closing time. See you tomorrow, Nev. What have you got planned for tonight, Sugar? Tonight? Nothing. Good, good. I've got another little... ...spot of trouble you might be able to give me a hand with. What's that? Why don't you go home, get spruced up and come back in an hour. It's nothing a bloke like you can't handle. Sit down, Sylvia. - What's she doing here? - What's she doing here? You needn't think I'll go for that sort of thing. Me either. Hi, girls. Nice night. Rosie, this is Sugar. Good day. Give us a swig then. Go on, off you go. Come on then. Where have you been? - Out. - Out where? Had a few drinks with Neville. Did you') Is there anything to eat? Probably not. Needn't think you can stroll in and get food when you feel like it. What else did you get up to with this barman'? We went up to his room. I met a couple of his girlfriends. 'Morning. 'Morning. Neville's got this big double bed in his room. Has he, now? He arranged to go out with these two girls on the one night. - He even got them-- - These stories are for the bar. Leave them. It's true. I was with him. We're not interested in the bloody barman. Shut up and eat. - They say he's a bit of a Romeo. - More than a bit. A lot of men run around before they settle down. Who said anything about him settling down? He didn't mention it to me. - You're an authority on this bloke? - Yes, he's my mate. I say stay away from the pub and the barman. You'll make a fool of yourself. - Says who? - Says me. I'll tell you something else, he isn't going to last long here. Why not? Because one day, he'll have a go at the wrong woman. When he does, he'll be thrown out like a can of shit for the dunny carter. Any fool can see that, any fool but you and him. Its lovely, isn't it? - How much? - Fourteen shillings a yard. Oh, dear. I can't leave the shop. I've got a customer. I'll see you later. This is silk, too, but it's cheaper. I like the colour of this one better. Cut me four and a half yards. I'll be back for it in a moment. 'Morning, Pierce. - There you are, Mr. Gifford. - Thank you. Taking up smoking? For my husband. Oh, yeah. Which one? Later, sweetheart. Please, I'm sorry for what happened that day. Excuse me. And you made out you were something special. It's always the way. I think I'm in love with a woman and then... ...and then suddenly I'm not. Might be something she'll say... ...or I'll hear by her voice that she might become a whiner... ...or worse still, a bloody nagger. Or she'll move her body in a certain way and I'll think: "Those tits are going to drop about a month after the honeymoon." When that happens, any woman walking down the street looks better. And I've simply got to follow her. You aren't... ...still sleeping with your sister-in-law, are you? No. I was just filling in time. Make sure she doesn't get her claws into you. She's got that look in her eye. What look? Like she's dying to give you everything she's got. The first thing she'll give you is a pair of bloody handcuffs. She scares the hell out of me. How come you know so much about her'? She's been following me all over town. It's all right, there's no harm in it. I feel sorry for the poor bitch. You're late. I have to talk to you. You been out with the barman again? It's about Marge and Neville. Get over here. There we are, darl. ...start feeling a bit secure and then they want to move in. - Come on, you encourage it. - I do not. I'm not wife material. I don't want to go on cooking and cleaning. What are you doing here? I wasn't feeling too well. - I came in for a brandy. - I thought you didn't drink at all. You remember Rita? Yes. Why don't you join us? I'm all right here, thanks. What's wrong with you? Nothing. - She doesn't look too happy. - No, she doesn't. She's all dolled up, too. It's not like her. Yes, she is, isn't she? You have to attract the barman's attention. Through the hatch. ...the salesman goes up, knocks on the door... ...and a little boy answers. He says to the boy: "ls your dad home?" The little boy says: "Mommy and Daddy are out..." Neville, girl needs a brandy. Yeah, right. There you are. It's him you came to see, isn't it? Thank you. They say he's doing it with Rosie Gibbs. It's a fine thing when a person has to come to a hotel to have a word with you. Barman. Another brandy here. I told you. She's probably gone looking for him. Girl wants another brandy here. This is a pub, isn't it? I want another drink. Don't be a mongrel. Give her another drink. Give her one to shut her up. Listen, sweetheart... ...nobody's going to tell Mrs. Jackson. Gladys, Neville's being a naughty boy and giving Marge another drink. She one of your girlfriends? Tell me who bloody isn't. Except me. What's wrong with me? That's what I want to know. Come here and give us a look, we'll tell you. What's bloody wrong with me? I told you to go home half an hour ago. Aren't you tired of making a spectacle of yourself? You might like to know, I've sent for your husband. And if you take my advice, you'll be on your way before he gets here. You just tell your barman to serve me another drink. - That's all the advice I want from you. - You've had enough to drink. Quite enough of everything, if you ask me. Aren't two men enough for you that you have to go chasing a third? I believe the gentleman... ...has made it quite clear that he is not interested in you. You don't know anything! You leave my girl alone. Daisy. Get out of this, Sonny. Go away. Get out of here! And don't ever come back! Can't she hold her grog? She can't take her alcohol. She's a tart. Wasn't it you who tried to make her one? Don't pick on me just because you don't know what to do. It's just a silly fancy that's got hold of her. Don't worry about Neville, because he can't stand the sight of her. That sums him up, doesn't it? You really don't know what to do, do you? You don't think I'm going to stand for this, do you? No. It's just something that's happened. I don't know why. He's not to blame. He hasn't done anything. He's only said a few words to me. Just a few words. Is he what you've been missing all this time? It doesn't change how I feel about you, son. I'm sorry. She's proud of herself, is she? She's turned me into a bloody laughingstock. I'd knock her off if I thought that would shut her up, but it wouldn't. Bitch is after me for keeps. Couldn't you get her interested in you again? Of course not, she belongs with Sonny. What's the matter with your brother? Can't he control her'? She's his wife, isn't she? Anyway... ...couldn't have come at a worse moment. Someone I'm very interested in is bound to find out about it. - Who? - Never you mind. Come on, I've never blabbed before, have I? Mrs. Fielding. Yeah'? I wouldn't mind throwing a leg over a woman like that. What's the matter? What's so bloody funny'? I don't think you're quite in her league yet, old boy. Come on. They're all the same in bed, aren't they? You have got a lot to learn. What's that supposed to mean? It means you lack the necessary finesse. Piss off. I'm not going to work today. I heard the window and thought Sugar must be back. I'll be staying here for a while if it's all right. If it's all right with Sugar, he's paying the rent. He won't mind. I'm sorry, Marge. I have to say this. There's no drinking allowed, you know, and no visitors at night. I understand. But if there's anything I can do... Thanks, Mrs. Gibson. Mr. Fielding. - Can I speak to you? - We'll be open in 10 minutes. It's not about money. Unlock that door and go in there, Sonny. You take her home with you. What will I do when we get there, Mrs. Gisbon? Tie her to the bedpost? She isn't responsible for what she's doing. You've got to take her in hand. I won't do anything that will make her hate me. This is some silly fancy. What else could it be? She'll get over it, won't she? Will you look after her for me, Mrs. Gibson? Anxious to be away, Nev? Fielding left this afternoon. Ta-ta. You said he was going for a couple of weeks, didn't you? I don't expect you'll be seeing too much of me. We'll see. I never make plans where women are concerned. Things seldom turn out the way you expect them to. Now, this one could be the sort I've been looking for all my life. Or we might finish with each other in a couple of hours. There's always the possibility she'll show me a couple of tricks I don't already know. It's more likely I'll deal her the same hand I've been dealing them since I was a kid. To tell you the truth... ...this is the moment 1 dread. The moment before it starts. When anything can happen. But probably nothing will. Still, that doesn't stop me. I go on searching. Where is this bloody woman We always been looking for? Does she exist at all? Is it someone I've overlooked? Who knows? Could be that pathetic sister-in-law of yours spying on me from her window. I don't know. I'm certainly not taking any bets that this one will be the right one. I don't count my chickens. And don't you count them for me. It's me, Marge. I've brought you a cup of tea. No, thanks, Mrs. Gibson. - Thanks all the same. - I won't take no for an answer. I'm coming in with it, whether you want me to or not. Out of the way, please. You know I'm not one to poke my nose in other people's business. But this has gone far enough. Try some soup. No, thanks. I couldn't keep it down, Mrs Gibson. This is all over that barman, isn't it? That no-good bit of rubbish. And Sonny Hills is such a good bloke. He could love me if he tried. He must be able to love me. Or what would be the point in my feeling like this? It wouldn't make sense. I'll be wanting my room back in the morning. It's my room. I'm paying for it. I want it back. He's right, Marge. Go home, my dear. Please, go home. Besides, you won't be needing it after tonight. That's Mr. Fielding's car down there, isn't it? Is she in there with him? What have you been up to, you little devil? Listen to me. Mr. Fielding's on his way up here. If you've got Mrs. Fielding in there, get her out quickly. Charles. Ride quick and tell Sonny Hills I want to see him. I want him here. Quick, now. Yes, Mrs. Gibson. What are you doing in my hotel, Mrs. Hills'? I thought I made it quite clear you are not welcome here. Are you in there, Mr. Gifford'? Open the door, Mrs. Jackson. Yes? Get your bags packed. You're leaving tonight on the 9:00 train. Am n I'm sorry, Neville. I can't keep you on. This is going too far. Do as Mr. Fielding tells you. Pack your bags. - Do you think I'll ever forgive you for this? - Go downstairs and wait in the car. Button me up then. Thank you. It was wonderful. It was my pleasure. Mr. Fielding! I don't want blood on my sheets! The man's leaving town. Isn't that enough'? It's all right, Sergeant. If you're still here tomorrow morning, I'll start on you. You silly boy. Somebody put you in. Yeah, and I know who. You're a real sport, Gladys. I'm like all the girls in town, Neville. I'm a little bit sweet on you myself. Marge, where do you think you're going? We're going away together on the train. Goodbye, Mrs. Gibson. Sonny, she's left. She's gone to the station. Where's the barman'? She wasn't supposed to go with him. Get in the truck. Give me a ticket to Sydney, Ron. No time for jokes. Just sell me the bloody ticket. All aboard, please. What in Christ's name are you doing here? I'm coming with you. Will you leave me alone? Don't you know I don't want you? That I'm never going to want you? I won't interfere. You can keep your lady friends. You'll be needing someone to look after you, won't you'? Now, listen to me. I put the hard word on you that day... ...because I didn't know if I'd find anyone else in town. That's all there was to it. You understand me? That's all there's ever going to be between us. I don't care. You're not coming with me. Come on. No. I'm coming with you. Please. Stupid bitch! - You're getting off. - Please. - Jump. - No, please. Let go. - Love me. - Let go. Love me. Love me. Stop it, you'll kill me! Get away. Get away. You go where you like now. I never want to lay eyes on you again. As long as I live. Mick found her alongside the railway line. About a mile from the station. She looks pretty crook. I don't think we should move her. No, I'll take her. I'll get Dr. Lucas. Get that blanket, will you? You've had an accident. It's all right. You're home. Not here, I don't belong here anymore. You've got nowhere else to go. Son, I'm so ashamed. Don't look at me. Where else would you go to'? My darling. Would you go looking for him? You'll never find him. Will you look for someone else? No one else will love you as much as I do. I don't deserve your love. Who else have I got to give it to?
