Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Say what? You want to fight Dhabla in court? You'll fight me? - No! No, Dhabla! Mercy! Forgive me! I will never fight cases I have small kids. Forgive me...! No! The gun. You will teach Dhabla the reins of business? I keep rates fixed. Collect the merchandise at the usual price If not, pack up and vanish. Go! Just kidding. Why get worked up? I want to work with you only. There you are. Just buy the stuff and take this Chugani used to say" "Never retract, never mind if the path is crooked." Get it? One must make sure the path is straight. Even God has given man the sense of thinking critically. Welcome, Shirke. I was about to send your fare Good you came. Sit. I hear the lawyer's wife is creating a ruckus. Don't worry about that. Let me deal with it. Inspector, you are a smart one. What does the government pay you? If your likes were to work for us, the practice of bribes would end. Law and Crime share a longstanding relationship. Both cannot survive without each other. Yes, I sent his corpse to the morgue. And termed it an accident and closed the case Like Dinesh Gupta's. Whom Kali had pushed from the roof. But worse things happen when a common man Who will dare raise his voice against Dhabla, This evening I am going with my friends to a birthday party. I'll call you up tomorrow morning. - Make sure you get home safe. My love, my sweetheart... who was that dude? - Why must you care? We don't like an outsider wooing a girl from our college. You mean, only we have the right to them? Give me a try, love. I'm smart too. You mustn't talk rash. She is the daughter of the principal You must not act fresh with her. - Kali! What impudence is this? - Nothing sir. I was just explaining to her the college rules I heard it. Meet me in the office. Right away! Looks like the Principal wants to give him a thrashing Last warning. Stop your activities if you want to stay in this college. Else, I will be compelled to take drastic action. What will you do? Tell me, what will you do? Will you expel me? Will you rusticate Kali, the son Dhabla? I very well know you are the son of Dhabla... who has established an empire of crime in this town But don't you forget, this is a college. And... I can't let you have your own way. - Hey, don't talk so loud. You cannot expel me. Have you forgotten? Dinesh Gupta's demise? Have you forgotten the statement you gave at his funeral? My father's name sends a chill down your spine. Have some water. Drink it up. Daughter-in-law Yes? - Can someone tell me where Pooja is? It's late. Why isn't she back as yet? - She is with her friends at a birthday party. I've sent Vijay to fetch her. They should be back any moment. Insolence! Not insolence, it's my style. Style! Just get out of my way! I won't. What will you do? You're crossing all limits. Get out of my way, Else what? Threatening me? And you have fun with that dude? Let go! Brother! Get lost! Dare not step forward! Get lost! Move it! No! No! Don't hit me! Don't! What was the need to party at night? The friends you move around with, them and their lifestyle, doesn't suit us. You will surely land us in trouble if you don't change. Father, they forced me. Forced? Don't you have brains to think of your own well-being? Girls from decent families don't stay away late Bhabhi! (Sister-in-law) - Calm down. Stop it now. She hasn't done anything rash, has she? Enjoying a bit on an occasion is not a crime, is it? Don't you defend her. At this age one should tread carefully. Enough, father. Why are you scolding her? You haven't said a word about that chap... Why do we bow instead of standing up to bullies We curb our womenfolk to get back home early. But to restrain people like Kali, are we doing anything at all? Like terrified rats, we scamper to the back of the house. Brother, this is no decency. This is cowardice. Forgive me, brother. Because of me you got an earful. I won't commit this mistake again. - Why bother? His anger is limited to us. He's like a meek rat in front of father. By the way, where is she? Haven't seen her in a while. Babulal, get me some tea. I have a headache. The long queues for the bus! Add to it the traffic! ls the boss all heated up? - Yes. Go on. Quick. Madam, have you cooked up a story to tell him? Be on time, at least someday. - It's because of you I wake up late. |...? - Yes. You trouble me in my dreams. Those dreams drive my sleep away. And when I wake up it is morning. Get it? - Sure, I do. Time to get in there. The boss is waiting. You are already in. ls this any time to come to the office? Sir, actually the cab... I mean, the bus... A new excuse! But learn to be in time. Understand? Sir, according to the chart... - Relax. Sit. According to the chart, this plot is ours. But Dhabla is not giving us. I don't want to mess with Dhabla. God has given us so much already Why fight over a bit of land? - A bit of land, but it's our land! He has made a liquor den out of it. Tomorrow he might turn it into a club and a casino. He may turn it into anything. What can be done against Dhabla? We did sent him official letters. It was of no use. You know the state of the police around here. To let Dhabla have the plot means to bow before a petty criminal. We should give him a sound reply. - I've tried doing everything I can. If you have any way out, go ahead. Hey! Who are you? Why don't you speak? Are you mute? You have got the notice to shift this place, I've burnt countless such notices in this furnace right here. Whose man are you? Khanna's? Or the governments? He is an engineer. Whoever you are, you won't escape alive out of here. I want this place vacated by tomorrow. Get it? Else, this fireplace will burn your bones to smithereens. Tell this to your Dhabla! And yes... You wanted to know my name, didn't you? Vijay Saxena. Hear that? What was his name? Yes, Vijay. His elder brother is a lawyer. Father, a college principal. And he is an engineer. So many educated ones in a family. Do you see? If you say, shall I cut him in two? - No! Chugani used to say... "Deal carefully with the educated". Understand? But I fail to understand one thing in the case of Dinesh Gupta, the one whom Kali assaulted, knows what I am. But how come his son doesn't? Uncle, he had once before messed with Kali. You son of a gun! Why haven't you told me that he hit you before? Pop, I thought... - Shut up! Not Pop. Don't you call me Pop. Of what use is that hair which grows on his head & face? He thinks he is a tiger. Scoundrel! He has tarnished my name. Get the car. Let me settle scores with that idiot. Mr Khanna, are you fed up with life? Say what? It happens. When a man is all alone, the heart starts yearning. But you have a little son. Where does he study? Look, Dhabla, I... Don't you show anything to me. Just listen. Got it? Just listen to what I say. Interruption makes me forgetful. What was I saying...? Yes, about your son. He studies in Ooty? I apologise for what happened. Actually, it was my fault. I should've held Vijay back. - Look Khanna... I opened a liquor den on your plot. I agree, I didn't ask for permission. But you too never complained to me. Did you? Then what's this all about police, court and notices? What's going on? But did I ever complain about anything? I never said a word. Buddy, you do your job & I'll do mine. Had I wished to grab that land, I could've taken your signature in the legal documents. I can do it, don't you agree? But did I do that? Did l? Chugani used to say... "Never enter into an agreement with educated people." You and I were going along just fine. Like the government. Where did that cheapskate appear from? Come in. So you are Vijay? So, it was you who destroyed my liquor den? Yes. Because the plot which you used to deal in belongs to Khanna constructions. How are you related to Khanna? ...Khanna, have you married into his family? I'm an engineer in this company. - Don't mess up again Else, Khanna will have to bear the cost of your mistakes. Dhabla, I feel you have a terrible misconception about yourself. The first thing you should do is to change the look on your face. Such heat in the principal's blood! Let me once lay my hands on you. I'll squeeze like a tomato. You'll squeeze me...? - Vijay! You need not interfere. Mind your own business. The world is bereft of any decency. Everyone becomes weak around thugs. Why are you upset if Mr Khanna doesn't want to rock the boat? It's a question of values. We bow, and it raises heads like Dhabla. Just yesterday, Kali tried to act fresh with Pooja. I gave him a reply. But it wasn't harsh. Scoundrels like him ought to be hacked to pieces. Vijay, your anger scares me. Won't you smile? Smile. Please. I was so nervous meeting your brother. One look at him scared the hell out of me! How am I to face the rest of your family?! Worry not. My folks are very kind. They'll be very happy to meet you. Agreed. But what am I to talk? What type of a person is your father? The first time I heard your name, I thought you would be very loud and talkative. But you are a real shy guy. - Not really. I speak a lot, but... - Now you've run out of stories for us! That's the aura of the girl's house. - What's the matter? Vikas hasn't called yet? - He called, has some urgent business Look Raja, you have the liberty to go stingy on words, but not on food In this matter I won't give you a chance to You have some more, sir. Priya, you will scald your hands. Let me do it. I'll do it. - Let her do it. You'll go away from this house. Then she will be the one to look after everything Go and give these puris. - No. I won't go. Go, I say. Go. Raja, it was nice meeting you. I like my daughters choice. She has got me out of a big quandary. - Not her. What? Why do you want to take the credit? Because I initiated it. Right? And I was dead scared to see you. I wondered whether you had come with a proposal or to carry me out. We were really worried about Pooja. Now she and you will get married at the sane time. Pinky, how do you like this Aunty? - Nice. But she doesn't laugh. Priya, that's enough. You've got to go home. Looks like it's going to pour. You must leave. Yes, Bhabhi? - Drop Priya home. All right. If you say so. - Oh really? I'll hit you Go and drop her. - Bye Bhabhi. Let's get down to work. Good girl. What's wrong? I ask you, aren't the law and police made to serve us? It's been six months, and you haven't yet found my sons killers. Despite my telling you that Kali is the murderer. Old man, are you out of your senses? Your son was doped when he fell to his death from the hilltop. Don't waste our time. If you have any evidence then bring it to us. From where do I bring evidence? He has bought everyone including you. Pandey! Doshi! Throw this old man out! What else can a corrupt police official do? Move it, oldie! - Sure. ls there no one to hear my woes? It's the criminals, who buy scoundrels like you for their benefits. Move it! I hope you aren't hurt? Be careful. Principal sahib? The ones who are careful are given the run-around. They haven't yet arrested my son's murderer due to lack of evidence. Tell me, where do I bring the evidence from? Help me sir. Aren't you the principal of that college? You very well know that Kali is the one who killed my son. Please testify, sir. Please! Look, I can't help you in this matter. Since I don't know anything about it. So you talk like them? Your name is Satyaprakash. "The one who brings to light the truth". If you resort to lies, your students will never learn from you. They will be called hooligans. And men like Dabla the edifice of this nation, will give them their strength. My son died. Good. Were he alive, I would've killed him myself. Because he was your student. Try... try to understand. I do. I understand everything. You are the confused one. Because it's my son who was killed, not yours. The support of my old age has been snatched, not yours. When an incident in your family when your offsprings suffer to death right in front of you will give you the true sense of the name bestowed upon you Mr. Saxena! And then you will realise the trauma of a father in pain. Munna, there comes my prey. Veil! - Let go of my veil. Shall l? Munna... Yes? - Shall I let go her veil? Let go. Else, the world will malign the poor girl. Let go, I say! Else, you'll repent it. Why get red hot for no reasons? You have stolen my heart. So I took your veil. The score is settled. Right? What say, Munna? The principal will know about this. - Principal? What will he do? He'll teach me some discipline? Enough! No more. You can't keep misbehaving and hiding behind your fathers name. If you care for the best, just get out of the college's grounds. You raised your hand on Kali. On Dhabla's son! I'll show you! He drove me out?! Swine! He drives me out?! He slapped me?! There's some strength in his bones! In those old mans hands. I'm going to ruin his life! Let's bump off that swine after college No Munna. No. Why him? What use killing him? He humiliated me before everyone. Now let me make a show of honour. I'll dishonour his daughter! It'll be difficult for the principal to show his face after that. "Save me! I'm an educated man. Give me respect." Then he'll realise the consequences of insulting me. Help! Help! - Take her up. Let go! Help! Scream! Call the principal. Come on. Let's make it upstairs. The principal is upstairs. Come on. Stupid. Run more. Please forgive me. Run OK lets play. Your're my sweetheart. I'm your beloved. Inspector, he killed her. Kali killed my Pooja! He killed my Pooja! Do something, sir! This slap is not because you bumped off that chick. It happens in our trade. But because you didn't do it using your brain. Couldn't you have taken her to our workshop? Forgive me. My mistake, Pop. - Don't you call me Pop. Even I had opened several shells when I was younger. But the police never got a hint. Shirke has a wide mouth. Wonder how much I must shell out this time to sort this. Why are you screaming at him? - There he comes upon hearing his name. Come, Shirke. What have you done with that girls body? It's happening. Everything will be done as we desire. Kali is like my son. Really? His second father? Well, the secret is out. Chugani used to say, "Be a neighbour to a punk, but don't be a punk for the police." Perhaps Chugani was unaware of a simple fact. No body wants to be a in a policeman's pocket, but bad times force it upon you. Right. You said it right. Now tell me how much to shut the law's mouth? - This case is of murder. Matter of someone's life. - Life? That girls life? Not her's. Kali's life. It's a case of murder, you see. For the noose don't we need a neck? I guess you got it? I got it. - The deal is going to be bit costly. Girl's name? Age? - Twenty. Do you suspect someone? - No. Ever fled home? - No. Did she have an affair...? - Are you out of your mind? Don't son. Don't. If you don't help us, how are we going to help you? I understand. And I very well know what this little act of yours is. Instead of finding my daughter's murderer, you are here to insult us No need for this mockery. In the name of decency Just hand over my daughter's dead body to me. Sir... The murderer is nabbed. Scumbag, just admit it. You misbehaved with Pooja And she died at your hands. Admit it scumbag! No! No! I have told you many times, I didn't murder Pooja, Kali did! I tried to save her, Inspector. I wanted to save her. The swine doesn't agree for now. But he will agree. Vijay, I didn't kill Pooja. I didn't. I'm innocent, Vijay. I'm innocent. Kali and his men tried to rape Pooja...! And then they killed her. This inspector doesn't listen to me. I'm innocent. Save me, Vijay. Shut up! Why are you maligning a decent boy? Wonderful! You are delivering your duty very well! So this is how you show loyalty towards Dhabla? What did you say? Mind your tongue. This is a police station. I know it. I even know that... the files here contain photographs of the innocent and the poor. And the lock-ups here bear the weak. This place is worse than a brothel. Shame on you You! More of this crap and I'll cut your tongue. Are you showing your masculinity on him, instead of on my sister killers? Dhabla's dog! Lock this swine up! - I won't spare you, Even you'll have to pay for my sister's murder! You'll have to pay! Get it? - Lock him up! Very wise of you. Now you are caught in the vice of the law. What's happening?! Pooja's funeral pyre hasn't even stopped smoking And Vijay... - He bashed up the inspector. The matter has become serious. - Tell me what now? Try out the senior officers. I shall meet the commissioner tomorrow. Let's see what happens. I wonder what move Inspector Shirke will make. He has tough skin. He needs to be tortured. You know what I mean? Dispatched to the heavens. - No inspector! True, dear. True. Headline for tomorrow. A rapist commits suicide in police lock-up. You won't do it, Inspector. You can't do this. Why not? The chap keeps screaming that the girl was his whole life. When his "life" is no more, then surely there's no reason for him to live. No! Come to your senses. This murder will prove you're corrupt. Help! No! Spare him! Swine! You killed him! His testimony could've brought the book to my sisters killers. Merciless! You have disgraced my families house. Take him away! - You swine! I won't spare you! - Lock him up! If I wish I can write you off at this very moment. But two suicides in one night in a police station is too much. It won't be wise. There will be an uproar. I can see the dirty colour of sin in your eyes. This colour is death's invitation. The end of not only you, but every sinner just like you. No! Help! - What happened? Help! Help me! Inspector, help me! He'll kill me! - Swine! I won't spare you! I'll kill you! No! Help! Help! You son of a gun! Who bashed you up this time? Bashed me up?! What crap! You know, this time I entered the police station to see Vijay getting.. Thank his stars that my eyes opened at the right moment. Else, I would've killed him, Pop. Don't you call me Pop. I feel as if someone spat on my face. You always complain. What else do I call my Pop, if not Pop? Shut up! I doubt if you are my son, or...! You are scared of that engineer, are you? I'm going to see him stuck to the prison walls Pop! Hello Dhabla. What have you done to the police station? Looks like a battlefield. Chugani would've said, "it looks like a desolate island." In which police station are you going to pursue my actions? Worry not. Trust me. He is in for a long stretch. Shut your mouth. And don't venture out of the police station. The eunuchs might take you along. You know them, Say what? Nice. It's nice to see this vandalised building. But, what use? You had to wear the officials full force. What had you told me? To change the mirror in my house? Sonny, Dhabla rules here. And in Dhabla's court everyone's account is double-checked. Start writing your criminal accounts, Dhabla. Because, once I am out I'm going to uproot your whole life. Look, the jackal voices before the tiger! Till date you've been encountered by cowards. The day you face this man, you'll be rid of this thought that you're a lion. The ones who try to touch me, I bury them six foot holes in the ground. Start digging your grave, and your son's too. Perhaps you won't get the opportunity once I'm out. Real hot blood! What did you say? How long will he be sentenced? As of now, for six months. But I'll try and get him a year. Can't make it for 3 years? - Possible under a different charge. 7 years...? - Section 307. Attempt to murder. How about 14 years...? - Murder. I see. Only if he murders someone? Else, no? Dhabla! What have you done? I did? - Yes. I didn't do it. He did it. Not I. He attacked the constable, and killed him. Then tried attacking you. Now tell me. Tell me, what's his sentence? Wonderful! What a criminal-mind! What sense of brilliance. He will go directly to the gallows. Not the gallows! No! Had I wished, I could've driven this through you instead. But, no. I want to keep you alive. In prison. For 14 years. Rot for 14 years in this cell, and keep chanting Dhabla's name. Forget 14 years, even if I have to wait for 14 lifetimes I'll wait to eliminate you sinners. You can't run away from death! You can't escape your fate! What has happened to you, child? Look what you've done to yourself. Would Vijay come back if you stop eating? Aunt, this is all a lie. Vijay has done nothing. He is innocent. He is being framed. Calm down, dear. Losing courage won't make a difference. Even his folks at home might be grieving. Who will comfort them? Have faith in God. He will make everything fine. And why do you worry? His brother will surely do something. Vijay my son, what has happened to you? Say something. What is it? Why are you screaming? What else can a common man do? - What is the need to do anything? To do, and have it done, is our job. - Is this your job? To tie up and beat an innocent? If you are a man then catch the real criminals. and lock them up. Can you do it? Can you catch Dhabla's crew? Satyaprakash! Mind you tongue oldie! No shackle can bind the truth. You will tire yourself. But you can never leash those that deserve it. Because you are a sinner worse than those criminals. In the name of a government badge you trade lives for money. I pity the future of the nation whose ideals have stooped down to dirty tricks. But don't you forget for one second; The waves of rebellion destroys the rocks of complacency. Father... At this hour of night? What else can a helpless father do but try? And... - Be brave, father. This problem is not limited to us. There must be hundreds of people in this city facing such nuisance. We too must face it. We must find a way. What way? Every step leads to the muck of crime! Where will you find a way? I see no ray of light in this absolute dark. Forgive me, sir! -You mean our nighclub? -That's the one the police raided. They also arrested 3 of our men. Where the hell did this Kulkarni appear from?! Call up Shirke. Let's find out his records of achievement. Wonder how many millions I will have to shell out to shut this guys mouth. Hello. Kothwadi police station. Dhabla? Yes, I found out. No. Whatever has happened has happened. Nothing can change that fact. Let's meet. Sir, the assistant commissioner has called you into his office. Why do the seniors do this mischief? Everything was going so well. Why did they have to transfer this man here? It's going to be trouble. - Trouble is for sure. Sir... you?! There sure will be trouble if the guardians of society are tainted. No sir. We are up to the mark. I know how well you execute your duties around here. All the illegal activities which should've been closed under your watch have been literally carrying on right in front of everyone. And you say you are up to the mark? - Sir, Shirke, you haven't yet realised the importance of this uniform. You are such a pest. You have made the walls of this police station so weak that even a little boy topples it down. In future, if you try to shelter a lawbreaker... you will never see this uniform being worn by you again. Understand? And yes, have Vijay Saxena transferred to my custody. I'll personally investigate the truth behind this case. Look... Whatever has been done to you, fair or unfair, is done. But if you try this escapade again, you will put youself into difficulty. Get it? Get that boy's case file. I'm Vikas Saxena. Vijay's elder brother. Yes, Mr Vikas? I want to tell you that my brother is innocent. He hasn't committed this murder. He is being framed. Every criminal's relatives say that their man is innocent. Have you ever led your father, son or brother to say that he is a criminal, lock him up? No, right? But sir, Vijay is... - Look Mr Vikas... Every case which involves the police is based on truths & untruths. There's no question of a case without lies. Leave the rest to me. I've sent for the case files. Sir, I expect justice from you. I'll try. Has he eaten? - No sir. So you plan to die in the lock-up? No use refusing food. We will land in trouble if anything happens to you. Are you listening? - Quite stubborn. He won't budge. I feel scared to go in. Don't you know what those men mean to me? At this rate I'll go bankrupt. Do something. Before they face the court, lose all the files. 35 men watch the place. Kulkarni has carefully chosen each guy on his team. It's not an easy task. Offer each one of them a thousand bucks and get the cases thrown out. I can't even gulp down whisky. And you are laughing? I remember your Chugani. What did he say...? Yes, "if you take a snake for a pet then give it milk" "But if you take a cop for a pet make sure never to feed them alcohol." Shirke, you haven't realised what I am. I know how to squeeze the one whom I give alcohol to and let grow. It's not wise to play with the law. What law? Solicitors like you have made it worse. Don't you scream! Since your father has taken the reins you've grown in stature. Tell me if you can't do the job. I'll deal with it myself. Now get out of here. Get lost! Hello sir. I'm Sharafat. Dhabla sends me. Black Label. It's genuine stuff. And this is a token of our appreciation. About the rest, he'll personally come and speak to you personally. What's your name you said? - Sharafat. This is my job, to take care of officers like you. Genuine stuff. Yes, it is. Scoundrel! Sharafat! I know how to deal with your kind of ilk. Tell me, is it genuine or spurious?! Tell me! Genuine or spurious? Swine! Dhabla's dog tries to bribe a policeman! I could've locked him in for 6 months... for drinking and creating a scene at the police station. You guzzled the black label that cost me 800? You went to him drunk? - No. He forced me to drink it all. What nonsense! You mean to say he...? Moron! Move it! - Why do you scream at me? What keeps you standing, sir? Please sit. I haven't come here to chat with you, Dhabla. I am here to say that, as soon as possible... shut the rest of your casinos, liquor dens and brothels quickly. They will be shut. Everything. No big deal. When the police were hungry, all the activities were open. Now that they are stuffed, everything will close But what do I call this? Hooliganism of the police? You haven't yet realised the true identity of the police. The ones who lived off your bones were not from the police. They must surely be the canine community. Chugani used to say... "When a person is heated up the other should stay cool." I know the style of officers like you. At first they show big eyes, then they switch to big puppy eyes. How would you like to go about it? lnstallments on a monthly..? First tell me, can you even carry on for a month living in this town? If your don't wind up, everything here will go to the auctioneers. And you will be locked up with your men. Gosh! Such men in the police! Open. Your charge sheet is sent. We'll know the date of your trial. I guess the verdict will be given on the first of the month. If not the gallows, you will be surely sentenced to life. I've gone through your case file. It's quite weak. I don't think any lawyer can save you. What you did, I don't think it was unjust. Because when you saw your sister's murderer, you saw red and you killed him. But you are carrying a misconception about Raja. That he killed her while trying to rape her. Pooja was Raja's fiancee. They were soon to get married. ls it true? But it is also true that Raja killed Pooja. Why did Raja kill Pooja? Why did he kill his fiancee? The one who loved Pooja immensely turned into her nightmare. Any other man in place of Raja would have done the same. Because no man would bear his fiancee's illicit affair. Mr Vijay Saxena, your sister was a wanton woman! Say another word against my sister, and you will regret it. My sister wasn't wanton. Nor Raja killed her. He was a witness, who was mercilessly killed in the police lock-up. And when I tried to save him, they... - I'm investigating this whole incident. I believe you are saying the truth. But your statement won't prove anything in a court of law. You need evidence. And I'll get it pretty soon. Forgive me. To break your silence I had to use these tactics. Trust me. You will get justice. But don't take any wrong steps that may jeopardise this. ls Mr Kamat in? - Yes. Can I speak to him? - Yes. Call for you. Savitri here. - Tell me, Savitri. Meena hasn't reached home as yet. I am worried. Must have gone to see her friend. Don't worry, I'll find her. Found her? I searched everywhere. Colleges and also her friends houses. They said she left college at 4. A policeman, are you? Your daughter goes missing and you can't find her? Has she a police label on her? God knows where she went. Mother! - My child! What happened to you? Where had you been? You know the plight of a young girl's parents when their child is out all night? Tell me. Where had you been? I'll tell you. Had I not reached on time... your daughter would've faced the same fate as my sister. -What? - You heard it right. What is the plight of a young girl's parents when their child is missing? Imagine the plight of a father whose daughter was raped and murdered and her lover is accused. Imagine the plight of the father... whose young son is implicated in the murder of another Imagine the plight of a brother, who on one hand lights the funeral pyre and on the other finds that a noose hangs over his head. Kamat, my sister studied in the same college as your daughter. Your department had her reputation disgraced and laying in tatters. No, father. Raja and Pooja loved each other. Why would he kill her? Meena, he very well knows that Raja did not kill Pooja. But bribes have shut his mouth. I agree. But what can I do all alone? I used to be proud of you. Because you were a police officer. But today I feel ashamed to call you my father. Enough, dear. I was helpless. But Mr Vikas, you've saved me from the muck of corruption. I'll tell Mr Kulkarni the truth. Kamat, run! Kamat, run! - No. Don't worry about me. Run! - No. Where were you running to? Are you in a hurry? Where you going to? To the assistant commissioner? To confess? I know everything. A righteous spirit has taken hold of you. I'll let your soul meet the supersoul. No! Look son! Look what has happened, son! How is bhabhi? - She is in a bad shape. She is not able to face this situation. I can't take this anymore! I can't! Untie him. Listen. Today is the hearing of Vijay Saxena, Damodar Thakur, Arun Shinde and Deshpande. I want you to take them to court. With utmost care. I'll meet you there. Mind you, all of them are notorious criminals. Make sure you keep your wits about you. Give orders to release Vijay Saxena. Quick! Release Vijay. Drop the gun. Let's go, Priya. Come on. Son, where are you? How are you? I'm perfectly all right, father. And, nothing has happened. Yes son. But.. but I am feeling uneasy. Your bhabhi... we are all...! I understand. But I can't bear to see my Bhabi in this state. But son, take care of yourself. Don't worry about me. Till I ruin the likes of Dhabla, not even Death can stop me. Father, take care of yourself. Vijay, you said it right. Someone has to kill an animal like Dhabla. The prayers of this city's aggrieved and poor are standing with you. Remember me when you need me. Let him go. Gupte... Shinde, this chap is after my life! Handle him. Shoot him if he comes in. Lock me. Swine! Today I won't spare you! Gupte, what are you watching? Shoot him! Lock me in. How will you kill me now? Move it! Why did you stop? Shoot him down. No one dare moves! I'll blow his brains out. Say what? How do you feel when death hovers over you? It is terrifying, isn't it? - Yes! What are you listening to his crap for? Shoot him! All the while you have been a "yes man" to him. sitting on this chair, has been a slave to Dhabla. I ask you, what oath had taken before you put on this uniform I ask you! Why don't you tell me? Why don't you tell me? Speak up! You tell me. You are a sub-inspector. You are their senior What is the duty of the police? Tell me! To protect. Protect what? - The law. And? - Life and property. And? - To protect the nation. So you are guardians, are you? Are you? Do you understand the value of this place? A common man comes here with hope. He holds you in a high status. He comes seeking justice. But you dash his hopes. If I wish I can riddle him with bullets. But I won't. I give you an opportunity to atone your sins. He made you partners in crime. Tell me, hasn't he? He has compelled you to go against your duty. And you traded your conscience to him! You have an opportunity. Wipe out the slur this police station. Dhabla did not kill Salvi. He is the real killer. Pick it up! You are on duty. And you don't listen to your superior? Are you heeding him? He is insane. But you are in your senses. Gupte, come to your senses. Blow him up! We have come to our senses, Shirke? You made an eunuch out of us, like you. No! Whatever happened is embarrassing. This incident brings shame to our department. Policemen gun down their fellowman right inside the cell? But sir, law and life were never guarded in that place. It sheltered deceit. Truth used to be murdered. We did not kill a police officer. Shirke wasn't a policeman. Under the garb of a policeman he was a henchman of Dhabla. He also had us assist him. We were mute spectators to his game of sin. That night... That night he mercilessly shot down constable Kamat. Because Kamat was about to reveal Shirke's true colours. After all this you say that we are at fault? We don't regret what we did. Sack us if you so desire. You can do anything with us. But we will surely know that by killing Shirke we have done a noble deed. I agree that Shirke misused his profession. His crime was an heinous one, worse than a petty criminal because he was a man of the law. And whatever happened was right. But if every man of the law begins to take the law into their own hands then the foundation of the law will no more exist. I'll try to get you least possible punishment. And I don't want you to be regarded as a scapegoat. Kali, who? - Kali, who?! Strange! Don't you know Dhabla's son Kali? Sir, your father called from Delhi. - From Dehli? Yes. He asked you to remain at your beach-house in Goa until he's back. And that Vijay... - Hush. And Vijay...? Don't waste time. Speak up! - He bumped off Inspector Shirke. Now he is after you. Are you scaring me? Perhaps Vijay does not know whose son I am. I'm Dhabla's son! By count, my father must've killed more men than that Vijay has lived. -You are right sir. My Pop will return, won't he? - Yes. As of now he is concerned about you. Tomorrow morning you must reach the check-post using a cab. In a cab? - Vijay recognises all your cars. Now let's get out of here. Hello. May I speak to Vijay? - Yes. Hold on. Yes Priya? - I found out about Kali. He is off to Goa with his men, tomorrow. Kali will certainly leave this city. But I'll decide where he goes. Faster. Quick! Faster! Help! Save me, Lord! No! No! Don't! No! Don't kill me! I haven't done anything. I haven't! Don't kill me! I'm officer Kulkarni. I need to meet Priya. What is the matter, Aunt? - I came to meet you. Yes? - I want to know where Vijay is. And I know very well that you know it. Of course, I know. He resides in the hearts of the poor, needy & destitute. He lives in their prayers. - Prayers decide hope & dreams. Not Law. Perhaps you are unaware that the deadly game which he plays, aided by you, leads him straight to the noose. He can't escape the law. - Law?! I know you and your law in and out. Today Dhabla's life is in trouble And to save him, you take the help of law to nab Vijay? Where was the law when his sister was raped? Where was your law when his brother was killed in the middle of the road? And where was your law when he was falsely accused? What is my Vijay's fault? Just that he is an honest man? And he never relents to hooliganism? Look Priya, we have collected all the evidence we need. It's not late as yet. Tell Vijay to stop this madness and hand himself in. Else, I won't be able to do anything later. One moment. I'm sure the call was made from a public booth. Find out booths where road drillings are taking place. What happened? Did he say anything? No sir. He is not willing to say anything. Oh come on. I said I know nothing. Look, it's important to nab him. Just tell us anything you know. Didn't I tell you? I know nothing. Why do you keep wasting my time? Sir, he won't listen. Let me break his legs! Here! Break it. Break this one too! Perhaps you will be content to deliver your message by making an handicap more helpless. Break this other leg too! Perhaps the government will present you a medal. I have lost this leg for the sake of decency. I had flatly refused Dhabla in abetting crime. And in return, he mercilessly broke my leg...! And officers like you never even dare to touch criminals like him. You just pursue warriors who desire to give Dhabla everything he deserves. But he won't come into your hands. Till he sees the end of Dhabla, he won't come up. You have the power of guns. But he... He has the prayers of poor and helpless people like me. Sir...! - No! To trouble him more will show us our corruption. Meeting him has shown me the extent of people's desperation. I knew it! You were forever in a hurry. 7 months into his mother's womb, he started to kick his way out. He was in a hurry. I'll perform his last rites. l, his father, will perform his last rites! I'll burn him! I'll watch him burning! No! I won't wait to watch my son's pyre go up in smoke, no! There are more waiting to die... those who won't have anyone to give them their last rites. Blood! Hurts, isn't it? Where had you been? To the temple? To pray for the life of your brother-in-law? He will die. Like your husband. One has to face the consequences of taking on Dhabla, right? Take care, Dhabla. Because, wherever he is... Vijay is piling up wood for your pyre! Certainly, Goddess! Not for him, but for his own funeral. Now the moron will come. No! Drive, Priya. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
