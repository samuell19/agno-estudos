How did this all happen? I've played this over and over again in my head. If I'd done something or said something, none of this would've happened. I just wanted to hang out with the popular girls at school so I became a groupie and just played along. How I wish I could turn the clock back. Mom? Mom? What, Carmen, what? Have you seen my purse? I don't know, it's around somewhere. Mom, it's Shea's biggest concert of the year and I'm already late. Life of teenagers. Ha! Ha! Hey Carmen, come and get it. Hey! Hey! Give me that. Hey, let go. Let go. Let go. Okay, bye mom. Be careful. I will. We want Shea! We want Shea! We want Shea! We want Shea! We want Shea! So, Shea, are we going to the after-party? That would be so cool. Are you kidding me? This is the after-party. Yeah. Shea, what the hell are you doing? Hey, Scott! We gotta get out of here now! Oh heck no, I'm having fun. So should you, douche bag. Shea, not again. Oh fuck off, Bill. Just get the double. No, it's too late for that now. Would you guys get out of here now? Now! Hey, don't be that way. Be nice to my groupie friends. I've got a problem here. I need makeup, I need coffee, I need it... black and strong. Hey, leave me alone. I just wanna go to sleep. Hey, easy man. You wanna choke me? I think I'm good now. Not quite. Makeup. I need... Would you sit up? Hey, don't tell me what to do. Well then sit up! I need a miracle right now. What a waste of my time. I don't need this shit all over my face. Hey, Wendy, you should be paying to touch me. Is he ready yet? I was born ready. I'm so sorry. Are you gonna be okay on your own, dear? You'll be all right. Don't worry mom, I'll be fine. Just have fun in Africa. Yeah, the African Safari, the sounds of the African Drums. I think I'll bring my own drum too. Honey. Honey, they have plenty of drums in Africa. Oh, all right. Hey, did you pack my underwear? Of course I did. Do I have my passport? Yes, you do now. Oh, my poor baby. Bad idea, mom, I don't want you to catch anything. Maybe call Dr. Richards, maybe he can come over. I will. And you can call us anytime. No, no phone calls. Just enjoy your vacation. Don't worry, I'll be okay, mom. We love you, Jamie. I love you too. Bye, mom. Bye, Jamie. Bye, soldier. Bye, dad. Let's get this party started. Oh, I see you buddy. Do your thing, do your thing. Don't leave me hanging. Woo! Hey, Jenn, take a hit of this. No thanks. You don't fool me. I know what you're trying to do. What do you mean? Small town girl who moves to a new school, wants to hang out with all the cool girls. I feel you. Stop. What's this fans of Shea shit. I know you don't give a flying fuck about him. You don't know me, Rocky. All right then, prove it. Prove it, prove it, prove it. Rocky, leave her alone. You are stoned out of her mind. What do we have here? It's good. See that's why she's my girl. Is everybody having a good time? Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! Wasted! What the? Did I die and go to hell? Hey, Jenn, wake up. Jenn, wake up. Oh my God, look at this mess. Ow. Damn it. Ladies, wake up. We've gotta clean this mess. Go away. Rocky? Oh my God. Rocky? Hey, Rocky! Where is everyone? Dude, it's like the morning after the party. Where's my shirt? Who's Brandi? Man, Dawn's gonna be pissed. Where's my wallet and my phone? Oh fuck, I was robbed. Oh, here it is, here's your phone. You should call someone. Call your mom or someone. All right. Hey, yeah, mom. It happened again. Okay. Can you come pick me up? All right. Fuck off. They stole my pants. Oh, Rocky. We've gotta clean up this mess. Jamie? Jamie? Jamie, what're you doing? Put that thing away! Okay, it's fine. I'm just messing around. It's fine. Don't you ever do that to me again. You scared me. It was just a joke. Where's you even get that? My dad's. Carmen, do you ever feel that your life is meaningless? That you're only existing and not really living. Don't be silly, Jamie, you have such a wonderful life. You're the most popular girl at school. If I were to drop dead today, right now, the world would still carry on. Nobody cares. Nobody gives a shit. Jamie, that's not true. I wanna do something exciting with my life. Something that would actually mean something. Let's get breakfast, I'm starving. Shea could be here with us, right now. Oh my God, I would die. Right? Like, how crazy? Honestly, that's such a dumb idea. How would that even work? It is impossible. But I love it, it's awesome. I knew you would go for it. Don't be stupid. Hey, it's not stupid. I have Shea's schedule for the next three weeks. Sick, I'm loving this already. My parents are gone for two weeks, so it's literally perfect timing. What's the point of this? We'll bring him to the cabin and convince him to make us part of his music entourage. That's so cool. Be his backup dancers. Concerts all over the world. Oh, what about Rocky? Rocky? Rocky who? Seriously? Kidnapping? It's not that big of a deal. It's just for a day or two. It's still too dangerous. I'm sure we will be fine. Jamie, how long were you planning this? Long enough to know we can pull it off. Jenn, are you with us or not? This is insane. I said, are you with us or not? Jenn. Sure, I'm in. Yay! We can't tell anyone. Seriously, no one can know about this, all right? To Fans of Shea? Fans of Shea! Here with me tonight is the music sensation, Shea Bowman. Thank you, Kay. So, Shea, how does it feel to have the world at your feet? To have thousands of fans screaming and passing out? Looks like the fans cannot get enough of Shea Bowman. Kay, I love and respect my fans because my fans are smart and intelligent enough to recognize true talent. Amazing. So tell us, what do you have next for your fans? As I was saying, there are so many copycats and wannabes out there but there's only one, and I repeat, one Shea Bowman. Mark my... Shea, it must feel great to have such a huge fan base. Kay, you just cut me off. Can you let me finish? As I was saying, there are so fakes in this industry trying to be me, trying to copy my style. Shea, tell us about your motivating factor. What is it that motivates you? I'm sure your fans would love to know. What is it that keeps you spinning hit after hit? Kay, you keep cutting me off. Look, I'm done with this interview, okay? I'm out of here. Fuck this! It's getting pretty late. I think we should do it two days from now, on March 15th. Great, the Ides of March. Shea's scheduled for a barber's appointment at Barry's in Ridge park. They usually drop him off and pick him up an hour later. How about his body guards? I checked. When he goes through Ridge Park, he goes alone. Homeboy feels safe in his hood. So this is how it's gonna roll. I was able to login to the company's dispatch system and his usual preference is a black SUV. So once we log into the system, we'll just switch it to a two hour pickup. Nice. When he's done at Barry's, we'll pick him up in out own black SUV. But how're you gonna get that? Don't worry about it. I still think this isn't a good idea. Anything could go wrong. What could possibly go wrong? Yeah, Jamie nailed it down pretty much. Yeah, it's gonna be so easy, I promise. Shea, what is wrong with you? What the hell was that? Why are you making such a big deal out of nothing? No, this is a big deal. It's gonna hurt your career. I was trying to make a point. She kept cutting me off. I picked you out of the streets, Shea. Don't you forget that. Mr. Superstar. Oh stop it, Scott. That's so cliche. Why are you hellbent on destroying yourself? We're just trying to help you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. The Fans are going crazy and Shea's ratings have gone through the roof. What is it about Shea Bowman? Now listen to that. Do you think he's gonna be around for a long time or do think he'll be gone in a flash? I mean, he's been around for a long time already. I'm sure he'll be around for a little while longer. What's your favorite thing about him? His hair? His music? His voice? His voice. His voice, yeah? Do you think he's cute? On a scale of one to ten, how cute do you think Shea is? Ten! Aw, that's so sweet of you. Would you think you're his number one fan? Yes. He's a commodity, let's just say. Commodity? Thank you very much. Wow, let's celebrate and pop some champagne! Just looking out for you, kid. Look, I don't need anyone looking out for me. I'm a grown man. Scott, don't act like we're family because we're not, okay? Don't have none, don't need none. No, no, Shea. Please! It's all there. Here's your key. Thanks. Ditch them when you're done. Yeah, of course. Shea, wait, wait. I'm sorry I came down so hard on you. Why don't we have lunch today? Just the two of us. Scott, I know all you care about is the greens. I care about you, Shea. Believe me, I care. Come on, man, I was just kidding. You and I have come a long way. Indeed we have. Look, I can't do lunch today. I have to run to Barry's but dinner's fine, so book it. Why do you keep going to the barber shop in Ridge Park? You shouldn't even bee seen there. It's hard to leave some things behind. Cut the nostalgia. They can't do a thing for you, Shea. All they can do is take from you. Scott, you wouldn't understand. Hey, Scott. I don't mean half the things I say to you, okay? It's all good, Shea. It's all good. You okay? I'm not really hungry. You've gotta eat something. I'm gonna be late anyways. Bye Dillon, be a good boy, okay? Listen to everything mom says. Carmen, you're crying. No, I just have something in my eye. I'm gonna be working on a project with Jamie tonight. So I'll be there. Okay. See you later. Bye Carmen. Bye Dillon. I just sent you a text with the login instructions for Executive Limousine, so exactly 2:15, login switch pickup time to 4:15. Okay, got it. Whoa. I don't have to use it, do I? No, it's not even loaded. It's just to scare him. So when he gets in the car you're just gonna point at him and tell him to be quiet. Are you good with that? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Don't move! Showtime, ladies. See you in an hour and don't be late. Shea! It's good to see you. How are you my man, Barry? How're you doing? You've been on the news a lot. Yeah. So listen, we want a quick trim? Yeah, just a little bit off. Ha! Yeah right. Just a little. I'm gonna make this quick. Dino wants to talk to you. He says it's really important. Let him wait. What does he want? You'll find out. I can't log in. Try again. We have to call Jamie. Hello? Hey, Jamie, we have to abort. Login failed. What? Try again. Repeat, we have to abort. Login failed. Carmen, calm down. Just try it one more time. It's not working, Jamie. We have to abort right now. Just give me it. Jamie, let me try. It's not working even for her. Okay, they must've changed it. I just need a couple of hours to log back into their system. We don't have a couple of hours. Hold on a second, the Caps Lock is on. Jamie, we're in. Great, let's proceed as planned. All right, bye. Is that good? Awesome, thank you so much. Hey. You're a good kid. Thanks. Hey. Good luck. See you around soon, okay? Yeah. See you, kid. Superstar is here. You wanted to see me? You're late. I hear the press has been rough on you. It's all good. It worked out well in the end. Now let's talk business. You have a Canadian tour in a week, huh? What's that got to do with you? They love you over there, I heard. Fans go crazy. Bring in the candy. Don't even think about it, Dino. Really, across the Canadian border? It's like a fucking drive through. You'll be all right. Just stop, I don't care! I'm not doing it! Dino, no, no and no! After this run, kid, you can vacation in Africa and finish your orphanage project. How do you know about that? Dino knows everything. In fact, I know this loudmouth punk kid shit you got going on is just a show for your fans. Do me this favor and I'll never bother you again. I'm sorry, Dino, I can't. After all I've done for you, this is how you pay me back? Yeah. I know you took me in when momma overdosed but I'm done with that life now and I'm never going back. Ah, yes. Marie. Lovely woman. It's a shame. She would have been better off if she had overdosed. What're you saying? Your momma is still alive but her brain is fried as hell. Tell me the truth, is Momma still alive? Goggles, I know you wouldn't lie to me. Tell me the truth, is Momma still alive? Dino figured you didn't need anymore problems. Yeah, she's alive. You owe me, kid. I've always had your back and you need to appreciate it. Why didn't you tell me? No, I wanted to tell you. But you became a superstar. Then I thought, I couldn't do that to you. I have to help her, I have to see her. That's where you're going. To Canada. You just need to deliver a little package for me. Why Canada? I thought to keep her away from the paparazzi. Also, those folks in Canada, they mind their own damn business. That'll be a sweet reunion, kid. When can I see her? You made the right decision, kid. Ouch, easy, you're gonna break my back. You're a strong lad, you'll be all right. When you cross into Canada, my contact will pick up the goods from you and tell you where she is. This is probably the last time I'm gonna see you guys. Shea, I finally got chartered. 10 long years it took me, so I'm retiring after this. Congratulations, Goggles. Hey, stay still. Jamie, I'm really freaking out right now. Okay, calm down, it's gonna be fine. Okay. I have to carry my own damn shit and open my own damn door? Fuck. Crappy service. Shut up. Don't move. Who the fuck are you? Don't move. What happened? Oh my God, it's Shea! I'm freaking out right now. You guys, this is not the time for this. Let's get this dude inside now. Is he okay? Is he dead? No, he's fine. I just had to whack him a little bit. He was getting out of control. Aw, poor baby. You'll be all right. He's bleeding, maybe we should take him to a hospital. No, we can't, he'll be fine. Let's just get him inside. Carmen, get a hold of yourself! Get the guitar. Why is it so heavy? So he wasn't at the barber shop? No, I didn't know the times had changed. Okay, thanks. Bye. That was the limo driver. Got to the barber shop and Shea wasn't there. That's odd. He's fine, he's not a kid anymore. No, we were planning to have dinner at the Riviera tonight. He would've called if he was gonna be late. Probably still mad at you. You know, I can't figure that kid out. One moment, the sweetest kid in the world. Next, he's just a fucking diva. You let him get away with everything. Maybe I shoulda book therapy sessions. You've been saying that for ages. Our concerts and tours are back-to-back for the next couple of years anyway, so I wouldn't worry about it. Well, it looks like I'm gonna have dinner by myself. Reservations are booked. You wanna join me? You go ahead, Scott, I've got some things to finish up. Okay. You'll call me if you hear from him? Will do. Enjoy your dinner. Who are you? Where is my guitar? Where is it? What is the big deal about this guitar? You have no idea what you're getting yourselves into. I said where is my guitar? Wow, this thing is so heavy. What's in it, rocks? If this is about money, you can call my manager, Scott. He'll give you whatever you want. Oh, we don't wanna hurt you. We're fans. We go to all your concerts. We follow you everywhere. Yeah, we like to call ourselves... Fans of Shea. Crazy groupies, that's what I need. Is this some kind of sick joke? We wanna tour the world with you. We wanna be your backup singers. Stop, you think kidnapping me at gunpoint was gonna make that happen? You're all a bunch of psychos. Can you even sing? Yes. We took singing lessons. Do you wanna hear something? Yeah, go ahead. Let me hear "Cinderella." Okay, let's show him what we got. ♪ Be my Cinderella ♪ A princess way past midnight Oh my God, you guys are awful! You're hurting my ears! You guys suck! You wanna be part of my team? Look, that's a joke. We can do something different if you like. I hate to tell you this, but there's no sugar-coding here. You can't threaten you way to stardom. Why are you so mean to us? I'm sorry, honeybunch, but you know me, I don't believe in bullshit. You just don't have what it takes to be a superstar. Hey, you. You seem to be the leader. Stop this right now and let me go. Shut up! And if I don't? I'm gonna shut you up. Hey, be careful with that. And stop pointing that fake gun at me. You think it's fake? You don't scare me. You're fucking crazy! You know it's real. If you wanna stay alive, keep your mouth shut and don't piss me off. Ladies, let's see what's so special about this guitar. Hey, you don't wanna mess with that! Jen, get over here. What's that? Cocaine. That shit belongs to some really bad guys that could do some damage. Oh, I'm sure. Would you have any idea how long you get for kidnapping? You get 14 years in prison. 14 years? Yeah, 14 years in prison. Jamie, is this true? Don't listen to him he's a liar. You're all going to jail unless the bad guys kill you first. I don't wanna do this anymore. I wanna go home. Jamie, maybe we should rethink this. Maybe we should just let him go. Finally, a voice of reason. You shut up! Ladies, let's go to the next room and talk. This changes everything. Hey, you come back here! You let me out of here, okay?! I don't think he likes us. Called us crazy groupies. We're screwed. I say we go to the police and turn ourselves in. No. They will put us in jail. You guys, calm down. I got this. I have an idea. Say we ask for ransom. What? You can't be serious. Say we ask for 500 thousand dollars and split it evenly. That's a lot of money. Yeah, he's worth millions to them. Sure hope you know what you're doing. Come on, guys, this is taking it to a whole new level. This wasn't part of the plan. Guys, I got this, okay? Just go home tonight, get some rest, I'll watch him tonight and we'll meet up tomorrow. Okay. Okay? Yeah. Goodnight. Will Shea be okay? Yes. Goodnight. Goodnight. Okay, bye. See you tomorrow. What're you doing? You're insane. Stop. Ow! Son of a bitch. Hey. I've seen you somewhere before. I guess you have all night to figure that out, don't you? Don't try anything stupid. For God sake, who is that? I gotta get it. It could be Shea. Is it authentic? Yeah, I'm on my way in. Where you going? I'll let you know when I get back. 500 thousand dollars. Hey Bill. I'm glad you could make it here so quick, Scott. Scott, Joe Schneider, private investigator. Nice to meet you, Scott. Joe was with LAPD for 15 years, so he's got some experience with this kind of stuff. Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of everything. Okay, where's the ransom note? "I've been instructed to write this "by my captors. "They'll let me go if you abide "by the following instructions. "Go to two of my banks and ask for 500 thousand in cash. "Take the money to Lake Wilcox Park. "There is a phone booth there. "At exactly 12:30PM the phone will ring "and you will be given further instructions." Yeah. That's Shea's handwriting, all right. We've got the Canadian tour in two days. Back-to-back concerts that have been pre-booked for over a year. This is messed up. I will try my best to wrap this up for us. Are you sure we shouldn't call the police? Too dangerous. You read the note, there's nothing we can do. How the hell did he get himself kidnapped? Thanks but I could use a scotch. I'm gonna ask a few routine questions here. Sure, go ahead. When was he last seen? He was heading to his Barber in Ridge Park. No one's spoken to hin since. Know anything about the barber shop? Same barber he's used for years. Since he's been a kid. Old Italian guy, his name is Barry, treats him like he's his kid. Anyone been up there yet? Yeah, Bill was, but all he knows is that he was dropped off and picked up by a black SUV. Okay, here's what I want you to do. Go to the bank, take the money out and just play along. Joe, are you sure? We're gonna be watch their every move. We're gonna apprehend those bastards just like that. I knew I could count on you. You can be rest assured, your money is safe. I don't care about the money! I care that the kid is safe! Don't worry. We're gonna have him home quickly. Okay. Thanks, Joe. Hello, Scott. How do you know my name? I know who you are and I'm watching you. Let's see, you're wearing an old black suit, tacky brown shoes. Your point? Follow the instructions and it'll be over quickly. Understood. There's a cellphone behind the phone booth. See it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it. Good. Now hang up the pay phone. Are you with me, Scott? Why are you doing this? Don't ask stupid questions. Look for the garbage can. No, to the right! Do you see a red backpack? Good job, Scott. Now transfer the money into the backpack and do it quickly! Okay, I'm done. Now take the backpack and walk across the bridge. When was the last time you took a walk in the park? That's none of your damn business. For you executives it's all about money, money and more money. Business a usual. Can you just get to the point? I said, keep walking! Okay, I'm walking. I'm walking. Do you see the backpacks? No, I don't see anything. To the left, you idiot! Yeah, I see them. Drop the cellphone inside the backpack and drop off the backpack with the rest. Then go home. What? You will receive further instructions. Where's Shea? I said go home! We'll contact you. I'm watching. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Now let's see what happens. No kidding. What the fuck?! Which backpack has the money?! Hey kid, what's your name? Justice. Justice, that's a nice name, I like it. I think you have the wrong bag, though. Thank you. Oh no, thank you. All right kids, let's go. All right kids, time to go. Teacher, the new bus driver is really cool. So what're you trying to tell me? A bunch of kids disappeared with 500 thousand dollars? I'm sorry, Scott. This is a highly sophisticated operation. We could be talking terrorists. Now what? Now we know what we're up against. We're going to catch those motherfuckers, don't you worry. No. I'm calling the police. You know what, this is way over your head. I don't think you know what the hell you are doing. Scott, let's stop and think about this for a minute. So we lost 500 grand? We make that in less than a week. If the press gets a hold of this and they find out about the double, we are screwed. There will be lawsuits and it won't be pretty. Joe, how many cases have you solved? This is actually my first case. But you were with the LAPD for 15 years. I was a janitor for 15 years. I worked nights and I studied case files. I know how these people operate. Let me handle this. This is a joke, right? I'm sorry, Scott. I did not know. I know, Bill, I'm worried about the kid's safety. For once, I'm gonna do the right thing. Which is? There's been a kidnapping. Oh, God. Thanks for coming on short notice. Hey, no sweat, no sweat. Glad I could help. Hey, this place is chill. Respect man, I love it. Thank you. This is cool. Hey, check out my new move. Ready? Yeah. Hey, check out my new song. I wrote it myself. You know what I'm saying? I don't wait around for people to write shit for me like Shea. You get what I'm saying. No, just hear it out. You're not Shea and you're never gonna be Shea. Okay, listen, just stick to the script and don't screw this up. I got it. Okay, I got it. I got it. No shaking, no shaking. I think you should let me go. That would be the smart thing to do. I'm sorry, I can't. You seem like a nice girl. I'd hate to see you go to jail. Stop, Shea, I don't wanna listen. I can tell you're different from the rest. How can you tell? I can tell. Let's talk about you, I'm curious. Why did you get involved in drugs? Well, I never really knew my dad and my mom was a dope addict. So the choice was pretty well made for me. Everyone has a choice. My dad left when I was only seven and my mom just gave up on life. She would just sit at home all day and smoke. I'd steal groceries and bring them home to mom. Hi, momma. Here are the groceries. Thanks, hun. Just put them in on the counter. Thanks, sugar. Maria, you need to get off your fucking lazy ass and get yourself a decent job! You need to take care of that boy! Boy's fine. No, he isn't. He's out there stealing and selling drugs. He's gonna get himself killed or child services is gonna come take him. Is that what you want? No! You better clean yourself up. You look like hell. Eva! Eva! No one's gonna take my boy! No one's gonna take my son! Eva, help Eva. No one's taking my boy. All right, listen, I'm gonna help you get a job, okay? That's what families are for. Sherman, what're you doing? Are you waiting for me? You should be in bed. I think I got me a new job. I'm so excited. I'm a bit nervous. It's my first day. It's gonna be fine. You'll be fine and you look so pretty, momma. Aw. Thanks. That must be your Aunt Eva. Okay, up to bed? Don't answer the door to anybody. I'll be home in a bit. Okay? Love you. So here? Uh huh. Here he comes. My freaky Friday John. I call him Fred. All right, well I'm out of here, girl. Okay. Good luck. Hey, rookie bitch. You talking to me? What're you doing in my territory? You got a problem? No, fuck you! Later, girl. Hey, baby. Want some action? Okay. Oh my God. She started selling herself to support dope habit. Help me! Help me! Help me! What do you want? Max! Max, please, I need some stuff. Get the fuck away from here! No! No! I'll pay you back. Doc? Doc? Doc? You again? Please, I need some. Listen. There's no credit here, you gotta go. Here, here, here. No, you're not getting anything. You're no getting no more. You owe me too much money already. I'll do anything. Look, you want some of this? Go get some money. Come back and you can have all you want. I'll pay you back. There's no more credit. Get her out, Max! Get the fuck out of here, you crack head. You wanna buy a dog? Bugger off. Get out of here and don't come back, okay? Please! Please! No, get away! I'm sorry, Sherman. I'm so sorry. I love you, momma. I love you. Shortly after that she overdosed and Dino let me in. I thought she overdosed. Three years ago there was this talent show at Ridge Park and Scott was there. After Scott saw me perform, he signed me right away and we left. Why did you go back to doing drugs? I didn't. I mostly go to Ridge Park from time-to-time to see Barry. He was like the dad I never had. Somehow going back there made me feel connected to mom. When Dino told me she was still alive, I had no choice. She's still alive? Yes she is, Carmen. He told me to move the drugs to Canada and he'll tell me where to find her. Now I'll never see her again. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize you had all this shit to deal with. Yeah, well we all got shit. Yeah. I've never told anybody this, but I wasn't always the spoiled rich girl who grew up in the suburbs. My dad was a high school teacher. He killed himself when he lost the job he had for the past 18 years. Before we knew it, the debts piled up and he just couldn't deal anymore. He drove his car over a bridge. It was ruled an accident and my mom got this huge insurance settlement and that's how we were able to afford to move here. He gave up his own life so we could have a better one. I didn't cry at his funeral. I hated him. He had no right to take his own life if he truly loved me. The problem is, Shea, I really miss him. I think about him every single day and the fact of the matter is he's never coming back. I shouldn't have done that. I'm sure the DA can cut you a deal. You can still walk away from this. I don't know, Shea. What if this is some made up sob story about Dino and your mom? What if it's all just a lie? Carmen, you have to believe me. I don't trust you, Shea. I wouldn't lie to you. I'll be outside. Carmen! I'm Detective Steve Callahan, this is my partner, Wayne. This is Bill, the assistant manager, and Joe, the private investigator whose been working on the case. All right, I'm gonna need a list of all of Shea's friends and anyone else he hangs out with. That'll be pretty easy. He spends most of his time with us. No girlfriends? The odd groupie, nothing serious. Do you know anyone who may be behind this? Not a clue. I'm gonna need recent footage of all of his concerts and I'm gonna need to know more about that school bus trip as well. Like taking candy from a kid? Five hundred grand. How the hell did that happen? We're close to solving this case. My men are on it. Is that right? Do you have any suspects? Any persons of interest? We're looking at everything. Terrorists, alien abductions, Voodoo. We're gonna get those bastards. Those motherfuckers are going down! I just need a couple more days to wrap things up. 15 years with the LAPD, huh? Oh my God. Scott, just sit tight, we're on it. Bye the way, Joe, you're officially retired from this case. I'm really sorry about all of this, Shea. You'll be home soon, I promise. It's okay. Do you want some? Sure. You're so cool, I can't believe I'm standing next to you. Thank you, Jenn. You're very pretty, Jenn. Thanks. I like your eyes. They're really bright and sincere. I can see right through your heart. Really? Do you have a boyfriend? No, we broke up. Well some day you're gonna make some lucky guy very happy. I sure hope so. Um, Jenn, I need to go to the bathroom. Can you untie these ropes? It'll only be a few minutes. I should ask Jamie. No, wait! I want you to take me. I'll ask Jamie, it'll only take a second. No, wait! There's nothing to eat here. Oh, that's cute. Jamie, Shea has to go pee. Okay. Wait, what about this one? I like this color too. Go! Anyway. Sorry about the gun. Jamie told me I had to. Now the other one. Okay, let's go. Up the stairs. Go. Are you gonna come in and watch me and my business? I guess I'll wait outside. Shea? Shea, are you okay? Shea? Oh shit! Jamie! Jamie! Shea got away! What?! How? Where is he? He ran out back. Jesus fuck! Stay here! Come on, let's go! I'm sorry! He couldn't have gone too far. Let's just split up. Shea! Where the fuck are you? Split up. Shea?! Shea, where are you? Shea, I don't have time for this. Shea?! Shea! Shea! Shea?! Hello, superstar. I oughta shoot you. Move! Come on you guys. Chain him up, ladies. Sit down. I just need a minute. Why don't you guys go home? Jenn and I will watch him tonight. Okay. Okay, good night. Jenn almost got away because of your stupidity. This has nothing to do with her. That's not exactly true. Jenn's been a bad girl and now she's gonna have to pay. Leave her alone, this is all my fault! I'm really sorry, Jamie. Hey, it's okay. I bet he used his rockstar charms on you, huh? I guess I just didn't know what I was thinking. Have you told anyone about Shea? No, I would never do that. Good. I know I can trust you. Why don't I give you a ride home? No, I think I can manage. You sure? Yeah. All right. I guess I'll see you tomorrow. All right, bye Jamie. Bye. Steve? Yeah? Here's the list of the people front row seats at seven out of ten of Shea's pervious shows. Any of them look suspicious? No, they look all pretty normal to me. You a big Shea fan? No. I'm too old for that kind of music. But my niece, she's crazy about Shea. If she knew what was going on right now, she'd be crying her eyes out. I bet. So these girls are so into it that they get tickets to almost every one of this guy's concerts? Mhmm. How much do those front row seats cost again? I don't know but it's gotta cost a fortune. Must be a bunch of rich kids. You got that right. Sorry to interrupt. Yeah, come on in. I pulled a picture from security cam feed of the barber shop. Jamie, senior at Richmond Falls High. She was adopted at age nine by Annie and Ron Feldman. She grew up in the same neighborhood as Shea and not too far from the barber shop. Great, thank you. Holy shit. There's gotta be some sort of connection there. That's what I'm thinking. You know what, just keep digging. See what you can find. I got it. Jamie Feldman. Hey, man. Hey. Yeah, Dino sits over there. Bling. This is all they have. Have you looked through it yet? Nope According to our guy, the cops say the girls in this photo are in connection with the kidnapping. Shit. It's Stone. Shit. Bling. Now this makes sense. This was from the school camera from the box's exchange. Looks like your kidnappers got away with a cool half mill and they still haven't gotten your boy back. This sounds like a job only Stone could pull off. Now this makes a lot of sense. She must've known about the Canadian runs. I want you and Goggles to find Stone and find her quick. I want my merchandise back. Do whatever you need to do. And I thought I was gonna retire quietly. Just find her! Come in. Steve? Yeah? A Miss Duncan is here to see you. Send her in. Thank you. Hi, I'm Detective Steve Callahan. Donna Duncan. My daughter is missing. Have a seat. How long has your daughter been missing? Almost two days. Did she call? It's so unusual for her. Who are her closest friends? Well, she's been hanging out with this girl from school lately. Can you identify any of these girls in the picture? That's Jamie and Dawn and the new girl from the east coast. Carmen. And that's my daughter. Can you tell me anything about her recent activities or any odd behavior? Is she in trouble? Is she okay? We don't know all the details yet. But I promise I'll do my best to find her. So please, call me if you hear anything from her. You have to find her, detective. She's my little girl. I promise I'll do my best, Mrs. Duncan. I'll find her. Okay? Thank you for coming in. Thank you, detective. Wow, this guy is so annoying. What do you want? We have to get out of here right now. Why? Jamie's dangerous, she's gonna kill us. She killed Jenn! Now I know you're acting crazy. Why would she kill Jenn? I swear I heard the gunshots. No. Jenn ran away. Listen, I care about you. This may be the only chance we have to get out alive. Can I really trust you, Shea? I have feelings for you. I know you feel it too. I can see it in your eyes. That night in the woods. Why? I don't know. Yes you do. This is crazy. Hey Carmen. We got it. Hey, Rocky and I can take it from here. So I guess we'll take care of Shea tonight and Jamie said we could. So you can go home with your family. Oh, okay. Later, Rocky. Chains and gags, Carmen? She's crazy. I got groupies too. Okay, stop. Dawn, come here. Dawn, we have to get out of here. Jamie is dangerous, she's gonna kill us. If we do not get out of here right now, we're gonna die! - Shut up! - We're going to die! Dawn, look what I found. What now? A guitar. I'm gonna sing him my song. Please, help me. He's gonna sign me to his record label. Hey, buddy. Whoa. What conditioner do you use, man? Some of that lady stuff? All right. I'm gonna take a selfie with you. All the chicks are gonna be digging it. All right. One, two, three. Groupies! Rocky, please carry this, it's heavy. Grab the money, let's go. What about your groupie pals? Hurry up. Don't worry about them. Let's go. Rock on, buddy. Can't wait till your next album comes out. All right, we're gonna go to Delaware, but first I need to buy some weed, all right. You guys going somewhere? Oops. Drop something? Oh, Shea. Jamie, just give me my cut and I'll leave. You got the gun. Just take it all. Really? Who the hell is this guy? Shut up, Rocky. How do I put this? I'm her partner in crime. Amongst other things. She did. So, Dawn, you broke the code of secrecy, huh? Look, Jamie, I just told Rocky. He won't tell anyone. You broke the code, Dawn. Jamie, don't do anything stupid. Yeah, you got the money. Come on. Let's just go for a walk. You're not gonna get away from this. Move! We're all fans of Shea. We're friends, you know. We smoke weed together. Oh no! God! Shea! We have to get out of here! Jamie's going crazy. She's killing everybody! We have to leave now! Let's go. Hello, Shea. Dino? Where's my merchandise? Jamie's got it but we have to get out of here right now. How the fuck did you get entangled with a bunch of crazy groupies putting my business at risk? We can talk about all of this later, but right now we really have to get out of here! Listen, Jamie, as you call her, or Stone, is a cold-hearted assassin. You should know her. Stone's from Ridge Park, just like you. Stone? Can't be. It is. That overweight little kid was adopted by some wealthy folks right after her parents were murdered. She shows up one day and asks me for work. I think we should get out of here before she gets back. Stone took out my boy, Bling. He was my trusted friend, my bodyguard and friend for more than 20 years. She has to pay! Listen, I'm sorry but this has gone way to messy and bloody. What're you doing? Come on, Dino, don't do this. Stone would've killed you both. So it makes no difference. Sorry, Shea. But like they say in the business, it's just a bunch of loose ends that need to be brunt off. Stone. Damn you, crazy bitch! I should've done this a long time ago. Recruiting kids into your dope squad? Most of them dead before they hit 16. Any last words? Stone. Did you kill your parents? What do you think? Am I missing something here? Enjoy the romance while it lasts but I have a plane to catch. I'm sure you know who I am by now, Shea. Stone? You look different. So you do remember me. I'm so sorry, Jamie. You knew her? Yeah, Shea. Go ahead. Show her your ugly side. Show you how you turned my childhood into a nightmare. How I wanted to kill myself because of you. Hey guys. Yeah? Wanna go pick on fatso over there? Yeah, let's go. How's it going, fatso? Hey there, weirdo. Hey there, stone face, stone, stone. You gave me that name, "Stone." We were just kids having fun. Bullying is fun, isn't it, Sherman? Isn't that exciting to see the look on those kids faces? That kid's messed up for life. Okay, guys. We go in, we grab the stuff and we run. Is that Stone behind us? She's kinda spooking me out. Yeah, I think she likes you, Shea. Shea, tell your girlfriend to stop stalking us. Okay, she's not my girlfriend. Leave us alone, Stone! And stop following us, you freak. Stop, what's that in your hand? They're getting married. I know, right. I don't even like her! Let's go. She's so weird. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I was stupid. It's too late to be sorry. Jamie, did you really kill your parents? Always creeping up on people. Fuck, beat it, fatty! Amber, is that you? What the fuck? Mrs Watkins, help, help! My parents have been shot! Oh my God. I saw him shoot them. I'll call 911. Come on in! Damn dope dealers. They didn't give a shit about me. I put them out of their misery. Then I was adopted by the Feldman's. Started a new life in the suburbs hanging out with all the rich kids. That got boring real fast. So I went back to Ridge Park and started working for Dino. I worked with him until last month. You used us. That was the easy part. You're all so dumb and naive. A bunch of spoiled rich kids. Jamie, you need help, let me help you. Just put the gun down, okay? This is for all those times in Ridge Park. I wanna hear you say it again. Come on, say it. Fatso. Ugly Duckling? Stone Face? Weirdo, loser? Fucking say it! I'm sorry, Jamie! I said I'm sorry! I was young and foolish! Look, Jamie. Just put the gun down. I know you don't wanna do this. Shea, don't come any closer or I'll kill you. I know you're hurting. Okay but that's in the past now. You can still make this right. Shea, I'm sorry but I can't go to jail. They have doctors that will make you well again. Jamie. Jamie, look at me. Jamie. Okay? Well, well, well. Darling, wasn't that a trip down memory lane. Bill, you're involved in this? Hello, superstar. You know, that was really good. You almost had her. No hard feelings, Shea. Bill, wait. Let's just talk about this. What is there to talk about? I can't fucking think straight right now! You can't fucking think straight because he's messing with your mind! Don't move or I'm gonna shoot your girlfriend. You think I care? Go ahead, shoot her. Why, Bill? Because I am sick of listening to your wining and your bullshit! Babysitting your grown ass while Scott lets you disrespect me? And poor Scott. Poor Scott, he's never gonna know anything. Bill, you can't be serious right now. Now put the gun down or go ahead and just shoot her already. You know he's not gonna kill me. Just let them go. Get out! Just go! Come on, Bill. Let's just go. We have new identities, we have the money, let's just go! Now you're having regrets? This is not you, Stone. No killings, Bill. Shea, go! Stay right there! Don't you know the rules? I'm so sorry. I just couldn't do it anymore. Just go. Get out of here. This time for real, Carmen. Jamie, no! I'm sorry, Jamie, for all the pain I caused you. Goodbye, Jamie. It didn't have to be this way. Hey. You kids okay? Yeah, we're okay. Mom? Sherman? Sherman, is that you? Oh. I failed you. I failed you, my boy. No you didn't. My poor sweet boy. I'm now a rockstar, mom, and I've come to take care of you. No. Shea, I am so sorry. I've let you down. It's okay. Who's this? This is Carmen. She's a very special friend. Hi, Maria. We've come to take you home. I will always miss my friends, Dawn, Jenn and Jamie. A part of me died that night. I lost them but I found love. I guess being the wife of a rockstar is not too bad. I still go to Shea's concerts, so I guess I'm still a groupie. Well, sort of. How are you doing today, Mrs. Bowman? I'm doing well, James. Thanks.
