IT IS SOWN IN CORRUPTION, IT IS RAISED IN INCORRUPTION. IT IS SOWN IN DISHONOR, IT IS RAISED IN GLORY. IT IS SOWN IN WEAKNESS, IT IS RAISED IN POWER. IT IS SOWN A NATURAL BODY, IT IS RAISED A SPIRITUAL BODY. - DADDY, WHAT DOES "EVICTED" MEAN? - HEH. WELL, THAT'S, UH...

WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, MY MAMA COULDN'T HARDLY GET ME TO COME IN AND GO TO BED AT NIGHT. I USED TO TELL HER I WANTED TO BE OUT WHERE GOD COULD SEE ME AND KNOW THAT EVERYTHING WAS OKAY. - YOU DESERVE BETTER, MAMA. - I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY I'VE WORKED SO HARD TO MAKE THINGS ALL RIGHT WITH YOU BOYS. - YEAH, BUT EVERYTHING AIN'T ALL RIGHT. - IT'S THE BEST IT'S BEEN IN A WHILE, SON. YOU BOYS AREN'T SCATTERED OUT AMONG RELATIVES OR SLEEPING IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. YOU'VE GOT A ROOF. AND EVERYBODY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. - YEAH, AND WAYNE STILL AIN'T COME BACK FROM TOWN.

WE NEED THE MONEY. - I'LL NOT HAVE YOU QUITTING SCHOOL, YOUNG MAN. WHAT I LIVE FOR IS KEEPING US ALL TOGETHER AND SEEING YOU BOYS GET AN EDUCATION. 'CAUSE IF ANYTHING WAS TO HAPPEN TO ME, I DON'T-- - AIN'T NOTHIN' EVER GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU, MAMA. - BUT IF IT DID... THE THING THAT I WOULD WANT MOST... IS FOR YOU BOYS TO STICK TOGETHER. AND I THINK THAT'D BE UP TO YOU, SON. I DON'T THINK YOU COULD COUNT MUCH ON YOUR DADDY. NOW, YOU PROMISE ME. YOU'LL KEEP 'EM TOGETHER. - I PROMISE, MAMA.

I'M GONE ALL THE TIME. - I PROMISED MAMA... THAT I'D KEEP US TOGETHER, WAYNE. - WELL, THAT'S JUST FINE, TERRY. BUT THERE AIN'T NO WAY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THAT'S A PROMISE YOU JUST CAN'T KEEP. - TERRY, YOU AND TOMMY CAN COME AND STAY WITH ME, AND YOUR AUNTIE SNUGS OVER IN BRAZELTON, THEY TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEIR RANCH. THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE IN A PINCH. - BUT, PAW PAW, THEY ALL WORK, AND THEY ALL GOT FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN. AND THE BOYS AIN'T GONNA GET NO SUPERVISION, PAW PAW. IT'S BEST THEY'RE WITH ME. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THEY'LL BE SKIPPING SCHOOL AND TAKING DRUGS. - TERRY, YOUR AUNT AND I WILL DO THE BEST WE CAN WITH CHARLES AND DAVID. LORD KNOWS THEY'RE A HANDFUL. - UH, EITHER THAT OR LET THE COUNTY TAKE THEM IN FOSTER CARE. - NO! NO, PAW PAW, THERE'S ANOTHER WAY. - WELL, YOU DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN COME OVER-- - PAW PAW, WE CAN STAY IN YOUR TRAILER. I'LL WATCH OUT FOR 'EM. WE WON'T CAUSE YOU NO TROUBLE. PLEASE, PAW PAW? I PROMISED MAMA. I'LL WATCH OUT FOR 'EM. WE WON'T BE NO TROUBLE. COME ON, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, BOYS? - WE WANT TO STAY TOGETHER. - AS LONG AS YOU WON'T BOSS US AROUND. - WHO'S GONNA COOK? - YEAH, WHO'S GONNA COOK? - WE'LL ALL COOK. - UGH. - DADDY, YOU'RE CRAZY IF YOU DO THIS. - HEY, DADDY, JUST GO DRIVE YOUR TRUCK. - CECIL, LUELLA WILL HAVE A CONNIPTION. - PLEASE, PAW PAW. - CECIL, YOU ABOUT READY TO GO? - COME ON.

YOU CRAZY, CECIL? - I'M JUST TRYING TO DO THE BEST I CAN. - WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T YOU CALL THAT NO-ACCOUNT SON OF YOURS AND ASK HIM TO COME HERE SOMETIME AND HELP! - LISTEN, PAW PAW, WHAT YOU CAN GET FOR THAT OLD TRAILER WON'T BE NEARLY ENOUGH. - I DON'T WANT YOU WORKING FULL TIME. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH STOCK YOUR MAMA SET BY YOUR EDUCATION. - YOU CAN'T DO IT BY YOURSELF, PAW PAW. AND, BESIDES, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO MY MOM WAS US BOYS STAYING TOGETHER. AND IF I GOTTA WORK FIVE JOBS, I AIN'T FARMIN' NONE OF MY BROTHERS OUT TO RELATIVES. - WELL... - HEY, SONNY BOY. IT'S GETTING COLD OUT HERE. CAN'T HAVE YOU CATCHING A COLD NOW, CAN WE? ANYTHING WRONG? - I MISS MAMA. - OF COURSE YOU DO. WE ALL MISS MAMA. THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' WRONG WITH THAT.

SONNY BELL JUST CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON CONTRACTING WITH SOMEBODY LIKE THAT. - YEAH, BUT, LEE... HE AIN'T GONNA HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM COOPS.

CAN YOU HELP ME? - IT'S ALL THERE, TERRY. YOUR GRANDFATHER NAMED YOUR FATHER EXECUTOR OF THE STATE. - YEAH, BUT PAW PAW WANTED ME AND MY BROTHERS TO OWN THE FARM, JUDGE. HE TOLD ME AND WAYNE THAT WHEN HE WAS DYING. - MAYBE SO, BUT HE NEVER CHANGED HIS WILL. THE WAY THIS READS, IT'S UP TO YOUR FATHER TO HANDLE THINGS. - YEAH, BUT HE'S GONNA THROW IT ALL AWAY. YOU SEE, PAW PAW LEFT ME A LITTLE MONEY IN THE BANK AND A GOOD FARM TO WORK. BUT NOW THE MONEY'S GONE, AND THE FARM'S GONNA BE NEXT, JUDGE, UNLESS YOU CAN STOP HIM. - WHAT YOU GOT HERE, TERRY, IS A FAMILY PROBLEM. NOW, THEY'RE THE TOUGHEST KIND. FAMILIES CAN GET ALL CROSSED UP, AND NOBODY WINS. THE ONLY THING I CAN SUGGEST IS THAT YOU HIRE A LAWYER. GO THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM. - "THE SYSTEM." JUDGE, BY THE TIME "THE SYSTEM" GETS OFF ITS REAR END AND DOES SOMETHING, THERE'LL BE NOTHING LEFT. THERE'LL BE NO FAMILY, THERE'LL BE NO FARM. IT'S NOT FAIR. - CHECK IT OUT. DADDY GOT HIMSELF SOME NEW WHEELS. - I DON'T BELIEVE HIM. - DADDY GOT A NEW CAR, TERRY! - BE CAREFUL WITH THEM BREWS THERE. YOU'RE GONNA SPOIL THE PARTY. - HEY, LISTEN, WAYNE, YOU GOT NO RIGHT TO DO THAT. - I GOT EVERY RIGHT, BOY. - YOU'VE THROWN AWAY EVERYTHING PAW PAW'S WORKED FOR, WAYNE. AND FOR WHAT? A NEW CAR TO SHOW YOUR WOMAN? - HEY, WATCH IT, BOY. [both grunting] - HEY, YOU AIN'T GONNA-- - THAT'S IT FOR YOU! THAT'S IT FOR YOU, BOY! [chatter and truck engines rumbling] BRING 'EM OVER HERE NOW. - SEAL 'EM ALL OVER HERE. I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND. [indistinct chatter] [Terry shaking container] - GETTING YOUR SHOPPING DONE, MR.

HEY, COME ON DOWN-- I'LL FIX YOU UP WITH A NEW REFRIGERATOR, DOES EVERYTHING EXCEPT WHISTLE DIXIE. - YEAH, THAT'S JUST WHAT I NEED. YOU HAVING A PARTY? - OH, HEADING UP TO THE CABIN. HEY, WANNA COME? - NAH, I GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW TO BAKE A CAKE FOR MY BROTHER. IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY. - MAN, YOU NEED TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME OFF. GET A BURGER, GO TO A MOVIE.

OR MAYBE EVEN TOAST. - IF YOU WANT SOME MEAT, WHY DON'T YOU CATCH SOME OF THEM BED BUGS AND STIR 'EM UP FOR BREAKFAST? - WE GOT WET SHEETS AGAIN. - WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SONNY BOY. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GUY, I WET MY BED A FEW TIMES TOO. - YOU DID? - SURE. IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY. I REMEMBER WHEN OL' JEFF THERE USED TO WET HIS BED, DIDN'T YOU? ALL RIGHT, NOW, EAT YOUR EGGS. YOU GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL ON A FULL STOMACH, SO YOU CAN LEARN SOMETHING. BUS WILL BE HERE IN 20 MINUTES. EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR HOMEWORK? - MM-HMM. - CHARLES? - MOST EVERYTHING. - OH, YEAH? WHAT DIDN'T YOU DO? - BOOK REPORT. SOME STUPID OLD HISTORY. AND I DON'T SEE WHY I CAN'T GET ON FULL-TIME AT THE HATCHERY, LIKE TOMMY DID. - BECAUSE THAT'S JUST TEMPORARY, TILL WE GET SOME OF THESE BILLS PAID AND GET A LITTLE BIT AHEAD. NOW, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT MOM TOLD YOU ABOUT SCHOOL? - I'M BETTER OFF AT THE HATCHERY. ME AND OL' MR. HISTORY NEVER DID GET ALONG. - YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU THERE. - OH, YEAH, RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I NEED. YOU KEEP AN EYE ON ME. - ALL RIGHT, HERE'S SOME LUNCH MONEY. Y'ALL HAVE A GOOD DAY AT SCHOOL. - MOM USED TO MAKE GOOD LUNCHES. - YEAH, MAMA WAS A GOOD COOK, WASN'T SHE? - YEP. - Y'ALL SAYING YOUR PRAYERS FOR HER, RIGHT? - UH-HUH. - YEAH. - ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU RENEGADES LISTEN UP. WHEN YOU GET HOME FROM SCHOOL, I WANT THEM CHORES DONE IMMEDIATELY. AND--AND, JEFF, NO SNEAKING OFF. AND, MICHAEL, YOU STAY AWAY FROM THE CREEK. - ALL RIGHT, IT'S TOO COLD TO FISH ANYHOW. - AND, JASON AND DAVID, YOU DO SOME OF THIS LAUNDRY, ALL RIGHT, HEAR? THIS PLACE IS A PIGSTY. - THAT BOY'S GONNA WIND HIMSELF UP SO TIGHT, HE'S GONNA BUST ONE OF THESE DAYS. - YEAH, OR BUST US. [typing] [adding machine clacking] - THAT'S NEARLY $30,000 WORTH OF BILLS, TERRY. - YES, MA'AM, THOSE ARE BILLS FOR MY MAMA'S AND PAPA'S FUNERAL, HOSPITAL. SOME BILLS MY DADDY RUN UP. I BEEN PAYING ON 'EM ALL ALONG AS MUCH AS I COULD, AND KEPT THE BOYS FED AND CLOTHED. - ABOUT YOUR FATHER... - HE'S ON THE ROAD A LOT. HE DRIVES A TRUCK. SEE, THAT'S WHY I CAME IN ABOUT THESE FOOD STAMPS. JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE, IT WOULD HELP OUT. - I'M SORRY, TERRY. BUT ACCORDING TO THESE FIGURES, YOU AND TOMMY TOGETHER MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY TO QUALIFY. - TOO MUCH MONEY? WELL... HOW ABOUT WITH SEVEN BOYS, AND I GOT ALL THEM BILLS TO PAY. - THE COUNTY CAN'T TAKE BILLS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN INCOME EXCEEDS THE ALLOWED AMOUNT. I'M SORRY, TERRY. BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO, PLEASE CALL ME, OKAY? - IT DOESN'T MAKE NO SENSE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. - CHARLES CAME TO SCHOOL FOR THE FOURTH STRAIGHT DAY WITHOUT HIS BOOK REPORT. - CHARLES IS GONNA STAND UP IN FRONT OF HIS CLASS AND APOLOGIZE TO HIS TEACHER. RIGHT--RIGHT THIS MINUTE. AREN'T YOU, CHARLES? CHARLES, AREN'T YOU? - YEAH, I RECKON. - AND THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, WILL IT, CHARLES? - NO. - TELL THAT TO MR. ROBERTSON. - IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. - IT BETTER NOT, CHARLES. I'M GETTING TIRED OF SEEING YOU IN HERE. - STUPID DUMMY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU KEEP DOING THIS, CHARLES? FOSTER HOMES! AND I AIN'T GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN, YOU UNDERSTAND ME? - YEAH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT! NOW LET ME GO! - [groans] - TERRY, YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH. JUST MY DAMN STOMACH ACTING UP AGAIN.

AND I DON'T WANT NONE OF US TURNING OUT LIKE DADDY. - TERRY, I... - WANT TO KNOW WHY I'M SO HARD ON YOU, CHARLES? IT'S BECAUSE, CHARLES, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOT A CHANCE TO MAKE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES. YOU GOT GRADES TO GO TO COLLEGE. YOU CAN BE SOMEBODY, YOU UNDERSTAND? - YEAH.

WELL, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT A CHICKEN BRAIN IS. IT'S SOMEBODY THAT FIGHTS FOR NO REASON, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. - BUT YOU FOUGHT WITH DADDY. - WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH YOU, DAVID? YOU BACKTALK EVERYTHING I SAY. I'M TIRED OF YOUR MOUTH. [sighs] WE'RE UP AGAINST IT, GUYS. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, TERRY? WE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT. - ALL RIGHT? DOES THIS LOOK ALL RIGHT TO YOU? EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY! EVERYTHING IS EMPTY, AND I'VE RUN OUT OF CREDIT AT THE STORE! - WE'D ALL BE ALL FINE IF YOU HADN'T RUN DADDY OFF. - NO, IT WOULDN'T!

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? - I'M GONNA BE 18 IN JUNE. I GOT MY OWN CAR, AND NOW I'M GONNA HAVE MY OWN PLACE. - LISTEN, I NEED YOU HERE. - NOW, WHAT YOU NEED IS TO LET GO A LITTLE, OR ELSE YOU'RE GONNA RUN THE REST OF 'EM OFF TOO. I JUST GOTTA HAVE SOME BREATHING ROOM, MAN. YOU'RE SMOTHERING US. - YEAH, GO AHEAD, TOMMY. THROW IT ALL AWAY. YOU ALREADY SPENT YOUR MONEY ON A CAR, WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAVING IT FOR SCHOOL! - IF YOU WANT TO SINK YOUR MONEY INTO CHICKENS, GO AHEAD! I'M SICK OF CHICKENS! SICK OF PEOPLE CALLING ME "CHICKEN BRAINS"! I GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO! - COME ON, TERRY. TERRY, COME ON. IT'S SUPPERTIME. - NOT NOW, NOT NOW. GIVE ME A BOARD. - YOU JUST NEVER QUIT, DO YOU? - YEAH, LIKE I CAN QUIT. I GOTTA THINK ABOUT TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTER THAT AND THE NEXT YEAR. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU BETTER START DOING TOO. AND PRETTY DARN SOON. - I AM, TERRY, I AM. ABOUT NEXT YEAR, I-- I PLAN TO-- - WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE? YOU GO TOOTIN' OFF LIKE TOMMY? - COLLEGE, MAYBE. YOU KNOW, IF THE MONEY'S THERE AND I-- - THE MONEY WILL BE THERE. NOTHING WILL MAKE MAMA PROUDER. - I KNOW. I KNOW, TERRY. LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. - OH, NO. NO. NOT AGAIN. [fire roaring] NO! - OH! - OH, NO! NOT AGAIN, NOT AGAIN! [all shouting] GET BACK, GET BACK! - TERRY! - NO, GET BACK! I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. WHY? WHY? - [crying] TERRY, WHAT WENT WRONG? PLEASE, STOP! PLEASE. - IT'S ALL OVER. IT'S GONE. IT'S RUINED. OHH. [fire roaring] I DON'T BELIEVE IT. - TALKED TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY THIS MORNING. THEY'RE GONNA SEND AN ADJUSTOR OUT LATER IN THE DAY. BUT YOUR INSURANCE JUST COVERS THE HOUSES THEMSELVES, NOT YOUR IMPROVEMENTS. - ALL THAT WORK. $8,000 WORTH OF MONEY FROM THE TRUST FUND, JUST UP IN SMOKE. - COULDN'T HAVE COME AT A WORSE TIME, EITHER, WITH THE HEARING IN LESS THAN A MONTH. - IF YOU WANT TO POSTPONE IT, TERRY, I'M SURE HE'D UNDERSTAND. - I CAN'T THINK ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE, DOROTHY, BUT HOW I WANT THEM TO BE. I WANT MY FAMILY BACK. I GOTTA FIND TOMMY. - WHERE'S TOMMY? - HE TOOK OFF. HE'S GONE. HE'S GETTING HIS OWN PLACE. HE SAYS HE'S 18, AND I'M SMOTHERING HIM. - I GOTTA GET HIM BACK HERE. - WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? - TOMMY DIDN'T GET HERE YET. - HMM. [man coughing] - [sighs] [child coughing] [horn honking outside] [door bursts open] - [whispering] YOU FOUND HIM. - [whispering] OH, YEAH. I SURE DID. - ALL RISE. THIS COURT IS NOW IN SESSION. THE HONORABLE JUDGE MCLAUREN PRESIDING. [pounds gavel] - COURT'S IN SESSION. WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE HERE. TERRY, YOU'VE HAD QUITE A SETBACK OUT HERE. SECOND FIRE IN TWO YEARS. - YES, SIR. BUT I'M GONNA GET THAT CHICKEN COOP REBUILT, SIR. WE STILL GOT OUR HOUSE, AND I GOT ME A NEW JOB. - WHAT KIND OF JOB? - I'M DRIVING A TRUCK AT THE HATCHERY, SIR. - ALL RIGHT. MS. WYLIE, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT FOR THE COURT? - YOUR HONOR, TERRY HAS TRIED HIS BEST, BUT NO LONGER HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO COMPLY WITH YOUR ORDER. THE BOY'S FATHER WANTS HIM IN FOSTER CARE. - I SEE. - YOUR HONOR... - YES? - I'D LIKE TO RECOMMEND TO THE COURT JUST THE OPPOSITE. GIVE TERRY CUSTODY OF ALL THE BOYS. HE'S MET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR EARLIER ORDER. FOOD, SHELTER, DISCIPLINE, EDUCATION. - THE FATHER IS CONCERNED AS TO HOW TERRY WILL FINANCIALLY CARE FOR THE BOYS. - I'M GETTING TO THAT. NOW, I HAVE SUPPLIED YOU ALL WITH COPIES OF THIS TRUST AGREEMENT FROM THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK. THEY'RE ACCEPTING THE FUND FOR THE BOYS THAT WAS SET UP BY THE FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH. THE BANK WILL INVEST THE MONEY AND PAY OUT $200 A MONTH FOR EACH MINOR CHILD. - THE FATHER WAS NOT A PARTY TO THAT TRUST AGREEMENT. - WELL, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE! HE'S ALREADY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ALLOWING THE FUND TO BE MAINTAINED FOR THE BOYS. DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THE CHURCH DOES IT OR SOME OTHER RESPONSIBLE ENTITY. - BUT, YOUR HONOR-- - PLEASE. JUST A MINUTE. MS. DONALDSON, WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND? - YOUR HONOR, THEY'VE GOT FREE HOUSING. AND WITH THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENTS THAT THE BANK'LL MAKE, THEY CAN MEET THEIR OTHER EXPENSES. AS GUARDIAN AD LITEM, I RECOMMEND THE BOYS BE TOGETHER. - THANK YOU. TERRY, I THINK YOU'VE, UH, DONE AWFULLY WELL WITH WHAT YOU'VE HAD TO FACE. UNFORTUNATELY, UH... I'VE NEVER AWARDED CUSTODY TO SOMEONE AS YOUNG AS YOU ARE. - JUDGE MCLAUREN, I'VE BEEN TRYING REAL HARD AND FOR A LONG TIME TO KEEP THE PROMISE I MADE MY MAMA BEFORE SHE DIED. LORD KNOWS I HAVEN'T DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT, SIR. BUT I'VE GROWN. AND THEY'RE MY BROTHERS, JUDGE, AND I LOVE 'EM. AND I WANT 'EM BACK. I CAN HANDLE IT. I PROMISE. - THIS HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TO MAKE. BUT I'M GONNA RULE IN YOUR FAVOR. CUSTODY GRANTED. [pounds gavel] DISMISSED! [kids cheering] [overlapping chatter] - OH, CONGRATULATIONS. - SARAH, THANK YOU. MR. KINCAID. - OH, YOU DID IT. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. [overlapping chatter and laughter] - HEY, WHERE'S MY LUG-- HEY, GIVE ME BACK MY LUG NUTS, JEFF AND DAVID. - COME AND GET IT. - HEY. - YOU AIN'T THE BOSS, TERRY. - HEY, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IF I WERE YOU. - YOU GUYS ARE GETTING TOO BIG FOR YOUR BRITCHES. COME ON. - I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IF I WERE YOU, BUDDY. - HEY, TERRY! [playful grunting and laughter] TOMMY! GUYS, IT'S TOMMY! [indistinct chatter] - CAN I GO FOR A RIDE? - WELL, SURE. EVERYBODY GETS A RIDE. - WOW, IT'S SO SHINY. - STICK YOU RIGHT HERE IN THE SADDLE BAGS. - WHERE'S YOUR CAR, TOMMY? - WELL, UH... A TREE RAN INTO ME. [laughter] WELL, I GUESS I THOUGHT I WAS RICHARD PETTY. - HOW FAST DOES IT GO? - WOW. - IT'S SO SHINY! - LOOK AT THE COLOR. - WOW! - GOSH, IT'S NEAT. - IT'S COOL. - YOU JUST VISITING? - WELL, I THOUGHT I MIGHT STAY FOR A WHILE, IF THAT'S OKAY.
