God. Shit! Who are you and why did you bring me here? Fuck. Bring you here? Lady, I just woke up. Look. Look. I was drugged. Some arsehole stuck me last night. Come on. See, please. Come on. Is that where you woke up? Yeah. You? Next door. A bunch of rooms out there. Is it just us? The first door I tried. What's the last thing you remember? Gorgeous brunette at the end of the bar. - Ah. - What? Just because I'm Irish, you think I'm a drunk? I was having a fuckin' ginger ale. What about you? I, uh, don't exactly remember. Don't remember? Well, forgive me if that doesn't do it for me. Because when it comes to a syringe in my neck, I tend to be specific. Now you're my new best friend. Oh, we're not friends. Come on, give us a chance, yeah? We'll be as thick as thieves in no time. I'm holding you responsible for whoever's going down with you. Hmm? Right then. After you. Stop. Relax. We're locked in here too. I don't believe you. You got one of these? I said stop. If you're trying to cut through, it won't work. - No shit. - That thing burns hotter than lava. You'll start melting the metal, and you'll be burning the whole place down. How do you know? My father's in the trade. What trade? Contracting. Just coming over here. What's on the other side of this door? A way out I was hoping. You. What's your name? Kate. I'm Rowan, if anyone gives a shit. We're here for a reason. What is that? A reason. They're plans to a vault inside the Matheson Museum. - The what? - It's... It's in Cleveland. Are we supposed to go to Cleveland? Wait... are we in Cleveland? What in the name of Jesus are we doing in Cleveland? - Where were you last? - New York. Arizona. You? Toronto. Vacation. Someone went to a lot of trouble to bring us here. So, whatever the score is, it's gotta be worth it. Score, huh? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a law-abiding citizen. Contracting, right? That's the one. But if this were a score, - what would it be? - I don't know. Great. Reality TV. Kiss my bollocks, big brother! High explosive. Semtex, maybe. Christ, it's enough to take down the whole building. Where the hell is it? I guess we're supposed to figure that out. Why the hell do you keep running toward all the scary shit? - Who the hell is this guy? - Hey. Hey! You wanna tell us what you're doing here? Same thing you're doing I'd imagine. Trying to get out of here alive. You tried to escape. Gerry, you're late. And I have a schedule to keep. You're cutting it awfully close. You've had months. Have you ever known me to let you down? This isn't exactly the plan we signed up for. Why you here, Gerry? Because they're worried. Because it's tonight, and because I wanna make damn sure our investment is safe. Is it? Look for yourself. You know, I've been doing this a long time and if there's one thing I've learned it's that people are who they are. I look at this, and I wonder what makes you think that they're going to do what you want them to do? Well, because they have no choice. Because they are... who they are. What's this? I'm not the one who's going to have to pay if this doesn't work out. Always nice to chat, Theo. Lovely to see you too, Gerry. No, thank you. Anybody mind? I was out in the hallway, I was looking for a way out, all hell broke loose. You didn't feel like coming out to say hello? Oh... let's just say I'm a bit shy by nature, and I wanted to know who I was dealing with first. You satisfied? Entirely. What's so funny? Well, you have to admire the humor of this situation. I mean, four thieves locked up and we haven't even committed a crime yet. Thieves? You know, I'll have you know I'm a contractor. Of course, you are, my dear. Now, listen up, kids... if you wanna know what's going on, take a good look around you. We're all players. - Experts in our field. - Get to the point. You wanna know the point, big guy? The point is, we're all career criminals... and this is a four-man crew. The mechanic. Rough, brawny. And you, dear lady, graceful, nimble. You're the B&E specialist. We called them cat burglars back in my day. And that leaves you. You slick-fingered devil. The safe cracker. What does that make you, smart guy? I guess that makes me the smart guy. So... anybody figure out what we're supposed to steal yet? You pricks did your homework. Who are you? Well, I'll start with the more infamous first. Boston Museum, 18th of March, 1990. - Nah. - Oh, yes. The frames of the pictures are still hanging on the wall. No way that was you. Grayson Bishop. And it most certainly was. In fact, I still have one of the Van Goghs hidden in a basement somewhere to prove it. So, an old-school master thief, huh? Maybe you're the one behind this? Teach yourself a few new tricks. I seriously doubt there is anything you can teach me. Besides, do you think I would try to blow myself up? This doesn't make any sense. Why us? Well, I'm the very best at what I do and I'm assuming you are as well. Otherwise I would be completely insulted. It would be easier to hire us, no? Maybe. Or maybe it's someone who knows that we would never work for them. Or better yet, maybe it's someone that wanted us fucked over. Like who? Do you got any enemies, kid? Because believe me, I have a long list. Don't call me kid, you old fogy. You make me glad I'm an orphan. And an angry one at that. So what are we gonna do? We live or we die. Doesn't sound like much of a choice to me. Excellent conclusion, dear. Harris. It's so good to see you. What's this? Our border guy, he's reliable, right? He is. We've used him before. You paid top dollar. He was instructed to turn off the cameras, was he not? Yes, sir. By you? Yes, I told him. I'll fix it. There is no fixing it, Harris. I'll... I'll figure it out. I'll talk... I'll talk to him. You weigh... about 75 kilograms, Is that right? Yeah. Shouldn't take too long. And please, just don't fight it. It's easier that way. See, Harris, every piece has a purpose. And every move has a meaning. And if you can't follow the rules... everyone loses. You're in charge now, and be careful decontaminating. We have to gain access though the main elevator. Then, we have to open a security door with an electronic lock. Next, we navigate a tunnel secured by motion sensors. Then, unbreakable tempered glass. Once through, it's the vault room which brings us to the custom 1970s Mosler. Even if you could do all that, which you can't... What's your exit plan? I was thinking I'd just walk out the front door. It's kinda the point of not setting off any alarms. That much security, what's in the vault? Gold. Bonds? It's diamonds. - What? - It's diamonds. And it all started right here. John D. Rockefeller. Son of a con artist. Became one of the wealthiest men in America. So, he had diamonds... a lot of diamonds. Hidden assets from the government I assume. Anyway, they're all stored right here in the museum. At least for now. I mean, they move 'em around from time to time. It was last rumored that they were in Italy. Florence to be exact. How do you know? It's about the Mosler. You see, it's a bit of a legend in certain rarefied circles. It's never been cracked yet... though it has been tried. Sounds like a bunch of bullshit. Could be. But our captor believes it's true. So then, what do they want us to do? Draw them a map? They've already got the blueprints. - They want us to steal it. - No. They want us to pretend to. How's that for a slice of humble pie? It's right this way, guys. And why should I trust you, pops? Maybe you're walking us to an early grave. This whole place is a grave. You shouldn't trust me. I don't trust you. I mean, after all, we are criminals. You're a real ray of sunshine, you know that? And you're a shoe size passing for an IQ, dear boy. There it is. Would you look at that. Just like in the blueprints. They built a replica of the museum? They want us to practice the heist. They're gonna watch our every move, and when we're done... Boom. And then? and then, someone else follows in our footsteps. And we are all okay with this? Do you have any other options? Shit. Well, I thought you were the safe cracker. This isn't a safe. It's... a computer. No, it's not. It's a puzzle. It's a Henderson digital lock. It releases. The way it works, it has four bolts from the door to the frame. - Then we can use a gun. - That's unnecessary. Oh, yeah, why is that? Because this particular lock depends on a person. A person who comes up with a four-digit pin. Yeah, well, that's like... a million different combinations. Permutations. And it's 9,999, give or take a fraction or two. But you see, our advantage is that Henderson keypads use silicone with positive printing. What the hell does that mean? What that means is that the surface clings to the oil from our fingertips. Move over, kid. You're blocking the view. All right. Ah, this should be easy. Twenty-four permutations. Voila. There it is. How did you know the combo? I don't know the combo. I know people, and I know my keypads. Yeah, but the keypad at the museum is not gonna be the same code. This is just a replica. Well, then it's a good thing we'll all be dead, and it won't be us actually the heist then, isn't it? I'm assuming the real security system won't have an off switch. That's where it is. That's where they hid the bomb. They found the replica. They're behind. What about Grayson? Played out just like you said it would. He got everyone on task, and he cracked the security code quick. And now... it's showtime. I don't know why you brought the whole tool shed. There's nothing in there to protect from lightsabers. What's she on about? I can do this. Do what? We need to redirect the laser. Did you bring the mirror? And see? Now it's in front of me. Your turn. Shouldn't we be motivating the others? I was just... looking for a weak spot. It's hard work leading a crew. I'm not leading anything. See, it's not just about skills. It's about personalities. You know Mag, she's strong and silent. Bruised... but very reliable. And Rowan, he's a joker but he knows his shite. And me... I'm the wiseass wise man. What about you, Kate? What are you gonna bring to the party that's gonna take us to the promised land? I'm not taking you anywhere. I don't know you. I know you. Should we cut the crap? Excuse me? Your Bingham Paxton's granddaughter. Corsica Cabal. You don't know what you're talking about. Spoken like a career criminal. There's no point in us lying to each other. We're all in this together. You mind me asking, how did he get pinched? Your grandfather was a brilliant man, and I was an admirer. It was a job. Italy. I was trying to crack a vault and I took too long. Police were supposed to be diverted, but... I escaped with the rest of the crew, my grandfather took the fall. What kind of vault? What kind of vault, Kate? It's important. - A Mosler. - A Mosler. This was your grandfather's final score. He died in prison, didn't he? And it's all your fault. You think you have the answers to everything. Listen to me, we do not have to do what they want us to do. You and I could figure something out. We don't have to play their game. I don't have to play your game either. I don't think you understand the variables here. We're pawns. We're pawns in something much bigger. Hey. We're ready. Rowan's got an idea for the glass. All right. Here's the news. Prorated 10-hour tempered glass. Steel can be cut, stone can be broken... but this... This some new age super-human shit. It's the kind insurance companies love to see. Now the vibration might be able to undermine the strength of the glass. You said it would break. - There's not even a dent. - No. What I said was, we might be able to weaken it. We need a minute. Hell with this. I'll join you. I thought you were supposed to be some kind of an expert. Christ, will you back off? Are all girls in Arizona this mean, or is it just you? I'm from Mexico. Oh, lemme guess, Cancun, Acapulco? Hone your skills breaking into rich tourist hotel rooms? - Sinaloa. - Oh, cartel country. No wonder you're so friendly. But I was raised in the Magical Crew. So, all my friends are dead. Fair enough. This is not about me. This is about Kate. I overheard her talking to Grayson. She's Cabal. You don't say. - Granddaughter of the great Bingham himself. - Hmm. - And I do not trust her. - Well... trust is hard to come by these days. I think that maybe we should keep an eye on her. Well, I'm keeping an eye on everyone. You're an idiot... if you are not scared of them. You should be. They could be behind this, and we have the cub in our den. And what exactly do you want me to do about it? I wanna show them that we are serious. Come up with anything? Pass me the, uh, splicer there. So, what did you and Grayson talk about? A score... you know, what else. Play poker? - No. - Well, you should. - You're a great liar. - What? Quick! What the hell? You're working with them. - Who? - The Cabal. I don't know what you're talking about. I overheard you talking to Grayson. You're Cabal, and they are behind this. Why would they do that? They are the only ones with the resources for this, no? You're making a mistake. We need each other if we're gonna get outta here. I think... that maybe you need us. And they need you in one piece. And maybe, if they're worried about you, they'll pop open the door. Only if they know that we are serious. What the hell is going on here? Nothing important. Just a small hiccup in group trust. - Don't be absurd. - What are you doing? Take it easy, old boy. - We need her. - She's Cabal. So what? She was Cabal. She's not anymore. Believe me when I tell you this. She is not the one responsible for all this. How do you know? She would never we caught dead working for scum. The likes of Theodore Thurlo III. Who the hell is Theodore Thurlo III? I mean, did we get kidnapped by a knight of the Round Table? He's the man behind this current predicament. And believe me, indirectly he has a deep connection to you. Bollocks, mate. You were born in Dublin, weren't ya? Yeah, I was. Theo had some crews there back in the day. You see, the one thing you have to know about our boy, he doesn't like to leave witnesses. Even crew. I understand there were a lot of bodies left behind in Dublin when he pulled out. You did say you were an orphan, didn't you? And you, my dear... you were part of the Magical Crew. Well, of course, you don't have crew anymore. They all went the way of the bullet except you. That's a terrible shame, now isn't it? A street kid like you raised in the gutter. I understand that Theo used to recruit all the urchins on the streets of Mexico. Only he didn't treat 'em so good. You don't know what you're talking about. Oh, I think I do. In fact, I think Dickens wrote a book about it. Scooped up... taught to steal... taught to kill... turned into something that you absolutely despised. And then betrayed, and left for dead. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. It's okay. Well, that's a hell of a punch you got there. How do you know Theo? What did he do to you? Well... it's more like what I did to him. The paintings. Boston Museum, you screwed him over. No, I did not screw him over. Let's just say I got the first punch in and won the day. And now he's taking his revenge. It's all bullshit. You know that, right? You don't know shit about us. Well, then, let's just say I came up with a good cover story for you. You better listen up, and listen to me real good, people. You're gonna have to be a lot smarter about what you're doing if you plan on getting out of here alive. Time to start phase two. What are you doing? What we should all be doing. Trying to find a way out. You're wasting your time. You're wasting our time. What, you think they'd just leave this open so you can climb up? What do you know? I know that someone has their finger on a trigger, not much else I need to know. Look, you don't like me. - Fine. I get it. - No. No, you don't get it. You don't get a fucking thing. You're Cabal. With all your rituals and your rules, and your lines of succession, all of that shit... You're just a bunch of spoiled, entitled, aristocrats playing pirate. You don't know what you're talking about. Everything that I know I learned myself. I didn't have no private lessons in some European castle. You know, I fought and I bled... and I'm gonna do the same thing to get out of here. This won't end the way you think it will. Not if we don't work together. - Ladies? - What? What did you do? Nothing. Bullshit you did nothing! Because I know I did nothing and youse two are... Wait. What are youse doing? Not running around like rats in a maze. Oh, Jesus. You sound like Grayson. Can one of youse explain to me - why we only have two hours left, huh? - What? That's not right. We should have a little under three. Well, you must have pissed somebody off then. - Now, can we get back to work please? - Why? - This whole thing is obviously rigged. - Maybe... but Rowan's right, and we need your help. There is no "we" here, okay? There is today. What the hell was that? I smell smoke. Where's Grayson? Having a sniff the last time we checked. - What the hell? - It's the blueprints. What's he playing at? Forgive the chicanery, my friends. - Damn it! - Prick! Fuck that bastard. Do you know how to fix this? Uh, gimme a minute, will ya? You always did have a big laugh at me, didn't you, big guy? Well, it's nice to know that today is gonna be more of the same. I know you can hear me, you treacherous prick. So, grab a handful, asshole, and pucker those lips and start smooching. He's probably looking for a way out. We are too, you prick. 16,000 degrees of separation, and I spit my last breath in your face. He's gonna burn the whole place down. Shit. He might actually get though. - Arm it. - You sure? Arm it! Shit. - Hurry! - Shut up, will ya. Why couldn't it be his own bollocks? He's gonna get us all killed. Now! You sure? Wait. I'll do it. Son of a bitch. Hey. Hey. - What took you so long? - Shh. What the hell were you thinking? Oh, just thought that I'd give you guys a head start. You wanted to see, so to speak. I'm afraid it's up to you to take 'em to the promised land. Shh. Just... Just stay still. See it through. Go back. I wanna know what he told her. - Can't make it out. - Well, try harder. - I can't. - Kei, try harder! Grayson never was a team player. - I just meant he... - The man was an artist. He pulled off the greatest art heist in history. Show some goddamn respect. Gerry. Please don't try to tell me that this was part of the plan. It wasn't entirely unexpected. I have no idea what that means. What it means, Gerry, is that he fulfilled his role. And sometimes you have to trade a pawn to put your pieces in the right position. Just remember who you're playing with. No more sacrifices. Get me those diamonds. Grayson went at it alone and look wat happened to him. I'm not... We're not gonna make the same mistake. If we're gonna win this, we need to get through it. You have a choice to make. I've made mine. We either die in here, or we get out together. Try it again. Anything we can use? It's shite, garbage and junk. Come on, there's gotta be something. Cut it sharper. Again. Okay, try again. All right. - Bring me the drone. - Why? The camera's got a memory card. Again. Higher. Try again. We're not gonna have time to make these adjustments. Well done. - Why'd you do it? - Do what? Rob those banks. Was it for yourself, or for someone else? Let's just say the Irish system for young lads without a family isn't all that great. I'm sorry. Pretty soon, you'll find your family on the inside is worth a hell of a lot more than whatever fucked up situation you have on the outside. Right... got it. A1 Charlie Swan. Steel. Steel. Tungsten carbide. Cobalt... bollocks. Nothing? It's got an extremely high surface compression stress resistance. - At least a nine on the Mohs scale. - What's that? Means it's hard as hell. Can anything cut though it? Diamonds. But unless you got yourself engaged lately you're on the wrong end of the vault for that. Well, anything else? Corundum, ceramic... Where are you going? Playin' wagon. What about this? What am I looking at here? Spark plug. Ceramic tip. - How did you know that? - My grandfather. Excuse me. You have something to hold this with? Yeah... here. Here we go. Okay. Wait. See? A dent. Smart. Very good start. Ceramic tip. Thank you. Excuse me, ladies. Would you look at that. Come on. Now, let's see what you can do. You sure she can do it? I'm sure. How you know? Because she hates me too much to fail. They all do. How much time do you need? How much time we got? Thirty-three minutes. Is it possible? It'll have to be. I'm sorry. Sorry was three hours ago. We're running outta time. She needs our help. She needs to focus. Just leave her alone. Alone? We're a team. One of us goes down, we all do. Look, I... I know you don't play well with others. You got the whole lone wolf act down. I get that. But you can't go through life on your own. I've gotten by so far, so thank you very much. Have ya? 'Cause it seems to me like you need a hand up from time to time. When you're on the ground, in a gutter, - you know who reaches for you? - Who? People who wanna use you, take advantage of you, who act like you owe them your life! Whatever happened to you, I'm sorry. But we need you, and I'm pretty sure you need us as well. All right. What about the liquid nitrogen? Could we freeze the lock? Maybe. It's a long shot, but it's worth a try. Look, we have an idea... liquid nitrogen. No, it... It won't work. There's a pressure loaded firing pin. It'll trigger the re-lock and we'll never get it open. How much time do we have? Twenty-one minutes. You can do it. Forty-five. Sixty-three. - What the hell? - What's wrong? I don't know. It won't... It's not... Come on! It should have opened! I let you down. Isn't that splendid? - You sure they cannot see us? - Looped the feed with the drone's memory cam. All that prick's looking at is Kate sweating over and over again. Do your thing. Let's pack it up. We're on the move. The police? Every cop for 10 miles is headed to the warehouse. This is our window. How's our team? En route. You have a job to do. I'll take care of it. Let's try another garage, shall we? We're not the bleeding A-Team. We don't have time. Well, let's get going then. I was just trying to make it more dramatic. Let's go. We have some shopping to do. You didn't buy anything? Didn't buy nothing. Better get going. Hey. We don't know how many there are. - If you find Theo's crew... - When... I find Theo's crew. I'll take care of them all. You just worry about the vault. You remember what I showed you, yeah? You sure you wanna do this? He threw us in a hole and left us for dead. I'm not gonna let him get away with it. Are you? Or it could be a trap. He thinks we're dead. He's never gonna see us coming. Not till the diamonds are long gone. - He's here. - Who? Theo. Hold on. We might have a problem. Kate. You look well. Try it. It's Mortlach, 1935. Your grandfather's favorite. I'm not here for a drink. I'm here for the diamonds. Aren't we all, darling. Tell me something. What do you see? Wealth and privilege. You know what I see? I see the lies they tell in the morning. These people... they're here to impress. To make a mark. - To be seen. - I'm not. What? Here to be seen. Dressed like that? They think it's an end to itself, but I just don't have time for that. So what then? Hmm? What do you have time for? Well, I like to enjoy the finer things. But the acquisition of those things... that's for them. I'm addicted to savoring the subtleties, Kate. I love the game. Just don't much care for the prize. You really should try it. The king-pawn endgame, it's a difficult position. Tell me something, Kate. Will you become a queen? I guess we'll find out. Well, game on. Oh, excuse me. No, my fault. Enjoy your evening. Hmm. I'm here. Elevator is on its way. Left you a present inside. Mag, you there? I cannot find Theo's crew. Keep looking. Rowan, I'm out. You ready to go? Ah. Mag, is that you? Who the fuck... Rowan, what the hell are you doing? Rowan? Mag, can you hear me? Get in. Give me the diamonds, Kate. Oh, I don't have them on me. You never leave the scene with a score. My grandfather taught me that much. I'm not holding a carrot. If you kill me, your diamonds will be gone. I promise you that. So you don't care about your own life. What about Rowan's? I just met Rowan today. What makes you think I care? Because I know you, Kate. It's why I picked you. It's why I picked all of you. It's why I allowed you to escape. - You knew we'd escape. - Of course. - But you tried to kill us. - That was motivation. - But the other team... - There is no other team, Kate. Just you. Every move you made, every action you took, you did it because I planned it and I wanted it that way. You were pawns in... Is this another chess thing again, because I should mention I'm more of a Monopoly girl. - Thimble? - Top hat. I want the diamonds, Kate. You kill me, you have nothing. I have Rowan, and we can make him talk eventually. But Rowan doesn't know where the diamonds are. It's just me. And if I die, your diamonds are gone. That would be a mistake. For you. See, there's no way that you financed this whole thing yourself. So, I'm betting you had a buyer. A buyer who fronted you enough for this whole operation, the replica and all. And I'm gonna bet that this buyer isn't the type to just write this off if you don't deliver. So... am I close? The diamonds, Kate. If I don't tell you where they are, no matter what happens to me, they'll come for you. Are there dice in Chess? Oh, very well. Kei, call Vince. Let's give Kate a little taste of what's about to come. Is there a problem, Kei? Oh, Jesus Christ. Mag, are you there? Mag, can you hear me? I'm heading to the rendezvous point. - Mag? - What happened? Yeah, we gotta go. Let's go. Mag, what the hell are you doing? I'm sorry, Kate. You don't have to do this. It's not too late. It is for me. How much is he paying you? I didn't pay her. I raised her. Kate, let's just stop this, all right. Make it easy on ourselves, and just tell me where the diamonds are. The diamonds are the only thing keeping me alive. The diamonds are gonna get you killed. And is it worth it? No. But making you fail, that's something I would die for. - Shoot her. - We should just take her and go. She'll talk... eventually. You know, I don't think she will. We need to reassess, and we need to clear the board. I don't want any loose ends. Shoot her. No, we need to get out of here now. This is not the time or the place for this. What did you say? I'm just saying that I think that there is... - I'm sorry. - For what? Don't listen to her. For what he did to you. For what he made you become. Magdalena... do it. Do it. Do it! I love you like a daughter, you know that. Like a daughter. I'm sorry. Okay, last chance. What did you do to her? What did I do to her? I saved her. Okay. Her family dead, she was on the streets and I gave her everything. What do you care? You turned her into a weapon. I saved her from becoming a corpse, and you made me shoot her! I really didn't want it to end this way, Kate. I'm okay. I come in here and save your arses again, huh? Take a seat there. You left 'em in a bleedin' bush? - Thought you were smarter than that. - Yeah? I was hoping Theo would too. You all right? I take no chances anymore. It's twist after twist with you, huh? It's like screwing on a bottle cap. Ow, it hurts to laugh. Here, gimme a look at those. You took a chance on me. You didn't have to. It wasn't a chance, it was a choice. You made one too. Don't worry, we're good. That was beautiful, just gorgeous, but, uh, Mag's just been shot, I'm bleeding outside a church, and you're holding a bag of diamonds. - So... I think we better skedaddle. - Yeah. There's a couple of things I wanna take care of. Surprised to see me? Kiss my bollocks, you baldy prick. Game over. - To Grayson. - That cocky bastard. Wasn't too hard to find the painting? Oh, I slipped through. Thank you. You got something for me? - Done. - That's it? That's it. Thanks for saving me a step. Never liked that guy. I'll be in touch. So... what's next? We all betray each other, Kate turns out to be Grayson's daughter. We'll whip off the mask, and it's Scooby Doo? Maybe. But first... you ever been to Italy? How's that? I think just a little bit... All about the angles. It's good? Just a little... Just a little bit to the right. Oh, a touch... There. I think it suits the place. It's like having a painting of your face. Where are we going next? Italy. We already decided in the last meet. Remember?
