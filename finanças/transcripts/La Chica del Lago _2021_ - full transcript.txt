waters of the enchanted lake a small boat port sail with several fishermen on board in the middle of the lake they launched their nets and they waited for several minutes hours passed and there were no traces of a single fish they say it was the day the fishes hide darkness surrounded the boat it wasn't just any darkness it was a cursed darkness of death until they finally saw a mysterious creature emerge it sank the boat with all the men on board the only survivor told the tragedy Then his parents told it and his grandparents told it again July 7 every 100 years at the Enchanted Lake that creature returns to do justice among the fishermen The girl from the Lake Come on, slowly slowly what the fuck happens with the fishes where they go hidden they are hidden Toño they won't come

don't want you to help me when you are older you can do it but not for now for now, I don't want you to go near the lake but Dad you promise me promise your dad fine look, son I'm going to tell you a story that my grandfather tell me it is a group of fishermen that one night very dark with the starry sky where the wind where the wind whistled like a wolf where the moon very little was seen suddenly a song was heard it was the song of a woman between sweet and sad it was a melody that it looked like it was crying and that hypnotized everything the whole town and whose song was that that song that song was from the mermaids half women and half fish your grandfather saw a mermaid the mermaids mermaids don't exist and you dad have you seen them have you seen a mermaid no mijo there are no mermaids mermaids don't exist only in stories only in stories it's time to sleep Let me see that very well very well here's your whiskey darling, thank you, my love good figures and you already counted your share of the money calm Edgar don't worry about the money I thank you in advance but I am interested in talking more with you and I'm not going to receive anything darling, you will always receive something but let me finish with Álvaro yes OK my love and how many boats you revoked today revoked not one I paid a visit to 6 fishermen and everyone had their documents in order there is no reason to send them from here And I tell you something they have the same rights that you have I can't believe you couldn't invent something for yourself these people are naive they believe everything they should disappear and leave us alone invent something Never you hired me so that I can review the documentation and that it is in order not to lend me to any of your games and I warn you Edgar I will not allow that you hurt the fishermen do not worry brother nobody here is going to hurt the fishermen on the contrary, we want their well-being truth that's right but out of the lake our lake is clean and soon it will be ours totally so Cheers for that Cheers Cheers how naive people are they make me laugh answer me the call, please who do you mean Antonio of course, who else you know that he think he has not paid me the last part of the boat and he did it a long time ago I have him convinced that he has to pay me insurance for each boat and because he can't be able to pay he has to give me back the boat what do you think look Antonio has a family you can't hurt them look Álvaro the very asshole has to pay me up to the last installment that I'm asking for or Tomorrow I pay a conjugal visit to his wife it was not a very important call and those faces what is happening I'm telling him to come with me to confiscate the boats and he does not want to accompany me but that should have been done a long time ago that's exactly why those stinky fishermen keep wandering around calm honey, do not eat cravings I am sure that Alvarito will accompany me tomorrow Right not so Edgar my dear Rafaelita I retire for purely personal matters and I also retire from the company so tomorrow I come to finalize the last matters that I have here pending so Edgar and Rafaela if you
