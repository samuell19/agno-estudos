NOT SO MUCH THE CLASSES, JUST OTHER THINGS. WHAT KIND OF OTHER THINGS? WELL, JUST KIDS' STUFF. KIDS' STUFF? LIKE WHAT? WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, MAYBE A LITTLE OLDER, I WENT TO SCHOOL IN ARIZONA THAT WAS MOSTLY INDIAN KIDS FROM THE RESERVATION. THERE WAS ONE BIG INDIAN KID WHO DIDN'T LIKE ME, SO HE'D CHASE ME HOME. WHAT DID YOU DO? THERE WAS THIS MAN WHO WORKED IN THIS GAS STATION THAT I HAD TO RUN BY, AND HE'D WATCH ME BEING CHASED EVERY DAY. FINALLY, I GUESS HE COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, AND ONE DAY, HE MAKES ME FACE THIS KID. HE SAID THAT RUNNING FROM YOUR FEAR IS MORE PAINFUL THAN FACING IT. YOU KNOW, HE WAS RIGHT, AND I'VE NEVER RUN SINCE. TIMMY, IT WASN'T SO MUCH THAT THIS KID DIDN'T LIKE ME. HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ME. IT WAS THE FACT THAT MY HAIR WAS TOO LIGHT, MY EYES WEREN'T DARK ENOUGH, MY SKIN WAS TOO PALE. IT WAS THE DIFFERENCES HE DIDN'T LIKE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY? YEAH... BUT WHAT IF THE KID IS REALLY BIG? THIS BIG? THIS BIG? HELP ME WITH THIS TABLE. GRAB DOWN THERE. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE THINGS THAT MAY HELP. MOST PEOPLE ARE RIGHT-HANDED, SO THEY TRY TO SWING THEIR BEST HAND. NOW, IF YOU FACE THE PERSON STRAIGHT ON, THERE'S TOO MANY AREAS TO STRIKE, SO YOU'RE GOING TO TURN SIDEWAYS. PUT YOUR LEFT FOOT OUT, TURN YOUR RIGHT FOOT. NOW YOUR HANDS COME UP. RIGHT HERE, KEEPING THEM RELAXED. THIS IS YOUR BLOCKING HAND. IF I THROW THAT RIGHT HAND, YOU COME ACROSS, BLOCKING IT. HERE.

I DIDN'T THINK YOU LIKED NICE BOYS, JUST BIG ONES. HMM. MARCO WANTS YOU TO GO TO VANCOUVER AND SEE LACOMBE. WHAT CHANGED HIS MIND? TWO PICKUP MEN, A LOT OF MONEY... IRANIANS... AND YOU. WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL? OR DID YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD? YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE, AND YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE FOR SAYING THAT. IS THAT A PROFESSIONAL OPINION? DOES MY OPINION MATTER? NOT REALLY. I'VE JEOPARDIZED MY POSITION WITH MARCO BY HAVING THIS RELATIONSHIP, AND YOU TREAT ME LIKE SHIT. THEN STOP BRINGING YOUR ASS OVER HERE. YOU SON OF A BITCH! [HORN HONKS] AH, MONSIEUR GROGAN, I'M SIMON NANTEL. MONSIEUR LACOMBE IS EXPECTING YOU. AH. MAY I? SURE. WHY NOT? PLEASE COME WITH ME. MONSIEUR GROGAN, IS IT? THAT'S RIGHT. REPRESENTING MONSIEUR LUGANNI. THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, SIMON, I DON'T CATCH THE ODOR OF OREGANO WE EXPECTED. COULD IT BE, MONSIEUR GROGAN, THAT YOU'VE REACHED A HIGHER SCALE THAN THE OILY ANTHROPOID YOU SERVE? MARCO'S BEEN CALLED A LOT OF THINGS, NEVER THAT. BUT I'M NOT HERE TO DISCUSS EVOLUTION. OH, I SEE. YOU AND MARCO ARE WASTING VALUABLE RESOURCES FIGHTING EACH OTHER. AN ALLIANCE WOULD BE MORE PROFITABLE. OH, AN ECONOMIST. HOW NICE. POOLING YOUR FAR EASTERN SUPPLIERS IS THE BEGINNING. MARCO WILL MEET YOU IN VANCOUVER IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. I'M NOT. ANOTHER FACTOR, THEN. AN IRANIAN GROUP IS MOVING INTO SEATTLE. AN ALLIANCE-- THAT'S LUGANNI'S PROBLEM. THEY WILL MOVE NORTH. THAT DOESN'T CONCERN ME. WHY DID YOU AGREE TO SEE ME? SO YOU COULD CARRY A PERSONAL MESSAGE BACK TO THAT GARLIC-BREATHED PIG. I HAVE MOVED SOUTH, AND I WILL STAY SOUTH! LUGANNI'S TOO WEAK TO PUSH ME OUT, AND SHOULD HE, YOU, OR THESE IRANIANS EVER DECIDE TO COME INTO VANCOUVER, I WILL PERSONALLY WRITE ANDRE LACOMBE'S NAME ON ALL YOUR SNOWY GRAVES... WITH PISS. GOOD-BYE, MONSIEUR GROGAN. YOU MISSED ONE. IT MAY BE YOUR HANDWRITING, BUT IT WILL HAVE TO BE HIS DICK. HOW DID YOUR MEETING GO WITH LACOMBE? I WOULDN'T CALL IT A MEETING. WHY? WHAT HAPPENED? WOULD YOU LIKE A MENU? NO, THANKS. TELL ME IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND. SURE. WELL, WHAT HAPPENED? HE JUST SAID AND DID THE WRONG THING. WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN? I'LL HAVE TO TEACH MR. LACOMBE A LESSON. BY LESSON I HOPE YOU DON'T MEAN MORE DEAD BODIES. MAYBE. WHAT WILL YOU DO? YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IT. [MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC PLAYING] WHO ARE YOU? THAT DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT DOES MATTER... [DING DING] IS MONSIEUR LACOMBE SENT ME TO GIVE YOU ADVICE. JUST YOU? I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE AROUND. MR. LACOMBE SAID FOR ME TO TELL... YOU, UM... CAMEL JOCKEYS THAT IF YOU FUCK WITH HIM, HE'LL CUT OFF YOUR BALLS AND STICK THEM UP YOUR ASS. YOU GUYS EAT THIS SHIT? YOU'RE A DEAD MAN. I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE. ARE YOU? NO. ALLAH PROTECTS US. WELL, THEN, THIS SHOULDN'T HURT. OR THIS. UHH! [CLANG] [SNAP] AAH! THIS IS JUST A WARNING FROM MR. LACOMBE. YOU ARE FUCKING DEAD. YOU ALREADY SAID THAT. UHH! YOU! FUCK! MOTHERFUCK! AAH! DROP DEAD. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] BONJOUR. MADAME LACOMBE, SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. SIMON, ANDRE NEVER DISCUSSES HIS BUSINESS WITH ME. I KNOW YOU CAN'T, EITHER, BUT... SOMETHING IS WRONG OR GOING WRONG. HE SEEMS SO DISTANT. EVEN WITH THE GIRLS. IT'S JUST NOT LIKE HIM. WELL, BEING HERE AT THE COUNTRY RETREAT, WHERE HE FEELS SAFE, AND NOW YOU'RE HERE, HE'LL BE FINE. AH! THANK GOD THE WEEKEND HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN. I THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER ARRIVE. MMM. OH, ANDRE, YOU LOOK TIRED, AND YOU PROMISED TO TAKE US ALL SHOPPING. IN A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS. THE SHOPPING COULD WAIT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, IT'S FINE WITH ME, BUT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEM. OH, WELL, I'M DOOMED. WELL, GO AHEAD, THEN. I'LL BE BACK SHORTLY. I HAVE TO DO THIS WHILE I'M INSPIRED. COME ON, GIRLS. SIMON, FOR NOW, I NEED A BIT OF SOLITUDE. INFORM MY ESCORTS OF THAT. GIVE HIM SOME ROOM, BUT KEEP HIM IN SIGHT. JACQUES, ARE YOU THERE? VOYONS. AAH! AAH! AAH! MONSIEUR LACOMBE! WHAT IS IT? AAH! MR. LACOMBE. MR. LACOMBE. LOOK UP, MR. LACOMBE. YOU SEE? YOU SEE? OH, NO! PLEASE! PLEASE! [SOBBING] ANYTHING! PLEASE! THIS IS ONLY A WARNING, MR. LACOMBE. AAH! OH! SIMON! SIMON! MONSIEUR LACOMBE! MY GOD! WHAT HAS HAPPENED? CALL SEATTLE. GET LUGANNI. ARE YOU GOING TO HIDE BEHIND HIM, YOU CHICKEN? ALL RIGHT, BO. SKIN THAT COONSHIT! WHATEVER YOU DECIDE, IT'S O.K. WITH ME. ALL RIGHT, BO. GET UP! GOD DAMN IT, BO! KICK HIS ASS! GET UP! SO I SLIPPED. NOW I'LL REALLY KICK YOUR ASS. OH! O.K. O.K. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. THERE YOU GO.

SHE'LL KNOW BETTER FOR NEXT TIME. COME ON. LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. I'M STARVING. HEY, MR. GROGAN, YOU HOME? MOVE THAT TARP. RIGHT. GROGAN, LIFE'S JUST FULL OF SURPRISES, HUH? EASY, PAL. I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THAT LITTLE RED DOT OVER HIS HEART AND LOOK AT MY IRANIAN FRIEND ON THE ROOFTOP. HE CAN'T MISS. SWEET, HUH? THEY WORK FOR ME. AND YOUR BOSS-- MARCO... WE WORK TOGETHER. HE'S GOT A MEETING COMING UP WITH LACOMBE. THEN WE HAVE PLANS FOR LACOMBE. YOU HAD MARCO FOOLED, PAL. YOU NOTICE I SAID "HAD." HE WANTED TO BLOW YOU AWAY RIGHT NOW, BUT I SAID NO. I TALKED HIM OUT OF IT. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE A COMPASSIONATE GUY. YEAH, SURE. NO, NO. I'M NOT LIKE YOU, CLIFFY BOY. I THOUGHT I OWED YOU ONE FROM THREE YEARS AGO. IT WAS NOTHING PERSONAL. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND IF I TAKE IT PERSONAL. LISTEN, YOU CAN TAKE IT ANY FUCKING WAY YOU LIKE, JACKOFF. THAT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE. I ALSO ASKED MARCO TO GIVE YOU 12 HOURS TO GET OUT OF TOWN, BUT AFTER 12 HOURS, YOUR ASS IS MINE. YOU GOT THAT? WELL, KID... YOU WERE JUST IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. THE LITTLE SPEARCHUCKER PISSED HIS DRAWERS. YOU FEEL THAT COMING UP AGAIN, JUST SQUEEZE THEM CHEEKS REAL TIGHT. [SIGH] O.K., ASSHOLE, LET'S BLOW THIS POP STAND. O.K., CLIFFY. YOU GOT 12 HOURS. WHAT'S THAT? HA HA! THAT MY WORK? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE LUCKIEST SON OF A BITCH I'VE EVER KNOWN. PICK IT UP HIGHER. HEY! YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN LUCKY, CLIFFY, ME BOY. HEY! OH! HEY!

YOU KNEW DELANEY WAS HERE. YEAH, WE KNEW. AND THAT HE WAS MIXED UP WITH THE IRANIANS. YEAH, WE KNEW THAT, TOO. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? YOU WOULD HAVE MADE IT PERSONAL AND LOST FOCUS ON WHAT YOUR JOB IS. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING. IT IS PERSONAL. STAY OUT OF MY WAY BEFORE YOU BECOME THE ENEMY. I'LL TREAT YOU THE SAME AS THEM. UM, NO. NO, THE DOCTOR'S NOT HERE YET. FINE. LET ME PULL THAT FOR YOU. EXCUSE ME. TIM MURPHY'S ROOM? I'M SO SORRY, TIM. I'M SO SORRY I DIDN'T SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU. IT'S ALL RIGHT... MAMA. I THOUGHT... [SNIFF] I THOUGHT THE HARDER I WORKED, THE BETTER I COULD MAKE THINGS FOR US. I'M SO AFRAID. THE HOSPITAL BILLS. WE'LL BE O.K., MAMA. I LEARNED TO FACE MY FEARS, AND... I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID. [FOGHORN BLOWS] HA HA HA! WE SHOULD HAVE SOME WINE TO CELEBRATE SUCH AN OCCASION. CHIANTI, I'M SURE, WOULD BE YOUR PREFERENCE, MR. LUGANNI. NO. NO. NO. NO, SIGNORE LACOMBE. I ACTUALLY PREFER FRENCH CHAMPAGNE. OH, SURPRISING. HA HA! OH. YOU'VE DEVELOPED A SENSE OF HUMOR SINCE WE LAST MET. HOW ABOUT SELF-CONTROL? WHEN NECESSARY. I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THAT I DID NOT LOOK FORWARD TO THIS MEETING. WE DON'T HAVE TO DRINK TOGETHER. WE JUST GOT TO WORK TOGETHER. HA HA! YES, YES. AND TO THAT END, I'M PREPARED TO MERGE OUR RESPECTIVE FAR-EASTERN SUPPLIERS AND WORK TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE THE IRANIAN INTERFERENCE. AGREED. YOU'VE GOT MY WORD ON THAT. WE'LL LET OUR PEOPLE WORK OUT THE DETAILS, HUH? AND, ANDRE--I, UH, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MEETING. WE SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT MORE MEN. SOMETHING'S WRONG. HE WON'T DO ANYTHING.
