Begin - Israeli PM, 1982 We'll may have peace for historic period of time. for which we look, since our state was recreated. so... And the land rested for forty years. As it's written in the Bible Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to introduce Layla. Enjoy Layla. Wishing everyone a Happy New Year. a peaceful year between Israel and Lebanon Applause for Layla. Our special guest of honor Samir Farhat. Wish him a year with lot of money, happy new year. Wherever there's war, there's money. Because wherever there’s war. the law... the law is asleep. Asleep, so... You always make money when you work against the law. or when you work illegally. or when you work in an illegal system. I don't want to say that I was doing something illegal I want to say that I was a working in an illegal system.' Good luck. -Thank you. The CD player's on top the cassette player's on the bottom. Write it down, write it down. Did you write that one down for me? -Yes. You wrote this one and this one... And this and this.. -What else? I already took one of these. It's great. -You took two. I took two. you know how I work. First I try it out. if it's good. I go for it. big time. With you. Shmuel. I swear. I feel like part of the family. I ﻿swear. Shmuel. I'm not sweet-talking you. Two days after the war broke out. four or five merchants came with suitcases full of money, I was in the state of war, but business continued as usual And we did a lot of business with them. So I'm the only one that has a moral problem when it comes to war and money? -War and money go together. People get rich from wars. and they always will. There's $6,360 here for 50 boxes of Chivas. We made a lot of money during the past 18 years. because we didn't pay customs and we'd sell at a price a bit less than it would cost if we had paid customs. Every other person is a merchant in Lebanon. Every group has its own merchant that buys goods for them... I think I'm the only one who has never had a partner. I thought your wife is the partner. She's the boss. You better not mess it up. I'm not a Jew... I'm Israeli. Go. go to Lebanon! There, they'll cut your head off. I'm trying all the time not to be alone. maybe because I feel that I'm always alone. I try all the time not to be alone. Meaning I don’t like to gamble but I must. for me, to be with my budies, just not to be alone. This is my building (in Lebanon), it’s not finished yet. It’ll be completely finished in one month. You see, it's a palace, a real palace. It has 4 stories, the penthouse on top is really cool. Over 4 million dollars worth of merchandise is in my warehouse. Our eldest son was born in the city of Sidon in Lebanon, Our second son was born in Nakura. now one is 14 and the other is 12. The way this business works. the wife is in charge of sales and I'm in charge of import. Officers of the Israeli Defense Force were at my house.that day, to Beirut on their own for a few months. So I said: We have to, we have no choice, you either want to make money or you don't. If I make money, I can give them a good life, and if I don't make money I can let them live.. a simple life, like everyone else. The way my wife smells today is driving me crazy... Hello, hello. Sit down, sit down. Come and take me to the border. We now go to a report from South Lebanon radio: Missiles hit northern Israel and landed in the border town of Kiryat Shmona. Three people were... Get into the shelters! Get down! Get down! Get into the shelters! I said get down Into the shelters! Come on! Quick! Don't cry, don't cry. Don't cry... Where are you going? Come on! Go! go! We're used to it. It's no big deal for me. You get scared just by the sound of a missile, For us. missiles are as common as drinking a glass of water. God! What did you do? Congratulations To the bride and groom It all began in '93. Samir was a merchant that came to northern Israel. to buy bomber jackets. He that watches over Israel will never slumber nor sleep... At a later stage, we became such close friends. that we started sharing an apartment together in Israel, I was not.only a bachelor. but a desirable bachelor, And he was a merchant that wanted to have a good time, and that combination, that puzzle. worked out well for both of us. This song is dedicated to the Lebanese. A year passed, came love You have no day, no night. You bring everything and not enough. When I introduced Samir to Sigal, my wife. Samir said: "Eitan, this is the woman." My wife now also has a close relationship with his wife. After all, his wife, Ma’a. was happy that I settled down. because that made his partying simmer down. My wife and I always say: Soon we'll retire. with the money we have we can start living it up. What we didn't do when we were young, We can do when we're 45.. And now. for today's headlines- IDF fighter planes shelled Hizbullah targets in in south Lebanon. According to Lebanese sources. 3 Hizbullah soldiers were killed. PM Barak reiterated that Israel will unilaterally withdraw, from Lebanon. How are you all doing Soon you will ask, "How are we all doing?" Everything will be OK. Sony and JVC T.V.'s, Cordon Rouge Champagne, Winston Cigarettes it's a shipment worth 77,000 Dollars. and I really hope I won't lose. but if it does happen... Beneath my building, where the warehouse is Nearby is the UN headquarters in south Lebanon. My wife is going to stay there I'm moving here, to Israel. I think the Lebanese government and army and the police and the customs officers won't make it there. The border will remain open, that's for sure. You'll have to deal a lot more with the UN forces. They’ll let us do business. Everything will be OK, it'll be OK. People weren't hard up in south Lebanon. Despite the war and everything, people live well in south Lebanon. You can live well in a state of war for 20 years? In a state like this? -Yes. We could do it for another 50 years too. They live well. Can’t you see I'm shaking?. I have a two year old baby. why must he suffer like this? Why? Is he still alive? Yes, and he has many years he needs that part down there.. Come on Eli... -You have good friends. I want to tell you. he used to get that pain once every two months, -A day! -A day. Well treat him and hope everything will be OK. I’m leaving you for a few minutes, OK? -OK. You know, all this.. This is all nerves. all these cramps, it’s nerves, yes. You must be used to it. Eli... -You're under pressure... 17 people were wounded in northern Israel. I heard there were 14 or 15... Don't you think we should leave him alone, to relax a little? him alone, to relax a little? Because he's shaking. Right here? -Right there, yes. He used to be a big drinker. He hasn't been drinking for 3 years. -Great, That's a real achievement. Not really... In Lebanon, If you don't drink or smoke or... Yes, then what? With four women then you have no life. -No life. I wake up in the morning and count the cash I have to send to the bank. -Yes. I count 5.000, 6.000, even 10.000 dollars. When I finish counting, after 10 minutes. I get an attack. I think it's from.. -Let him count the money. Let him get the attack. -I keep telling-him... When the pain begins, it makes.your blood vessels shrink. as well as your muscles... In the sauna... -You feel good. but as soon as you're outside, you get a headache. -Yes. Why? Samir. you have to start thinking less about the pain and more about other things. So you're saying he needs to see a psychologist. No, not a psychologist... No, what are you talking about, a psychologist... Eli, that has nothing to do with it, come on. I go dancing. I relax. I go to the casino, I play, relax, have fun and get an attack. You don't relax in the casino... But I just want to know, will I have to live with this? Look.. I'm a doctor, not a prophet. -OK... -Let’s wait and see. This suitcase has been ready for two months now... -What's in it? for two months now... -What’s in it? Provisions for fleeing. I don't waste any, time, I grab the bag with all my clothes... Where are you going now? Anywhere, as long as we can flee from this city, from death. Now let’s sit down and have a nice, quiet cup of coffee... Ma'a, we've heard that missiles were shot on our village, somebody told us. Faris didn't come to you? And Abu farach? and Yussef? Call them to help you. Ask for Avi's telephone number, urgent. -South Lebanon - - symbol of nationality- This is a war for the Security Zone, from which its sons drank the milk of pride and honor, and they were consumed with patriotism, till death. They are the ones who created tomorrow's honor for us. We are all indebted to the soldiers of the South Lebanon Arm . We'll eternally remember you for your courage. This has become the memorial day for our fallen heroes. the Security Zone and its inhabitants. We'd like to thank the SLA Commander. General Lahad. who made this ceremony possible. Israel's Northern Commander. Major-General Gabi Ashkenazi. I'd like to thank General Lahad for their daily fighting. They never stop, not even now. I'd like to thank the handicapped and wounded No matter where the future takes us, we will not forget, we will not abandon, we will not forsake. I have connections with very high-ranking officers, that I'm an important person too, - Israeli-Lebanese Border - What happened last night... 8 Hizbullah men were killed. In situations like this. I always wear a uniform. For us. it’s a way of life. Samir, speak first. I have Spanish pressure cookers and vodka with Hebrew labels on them, as well as cigarettes... All three containers... I have the... -Wait.a minute. All three containers, to transit... -Overseas. -Overseas. We are asking of you. not to sell the goods into Israel. the border will not be closed under any circumstances. We want to help you to get the goods through the border! One by one. the State of Israel is our partner, there's no border between us. All of our children would be willing to cut through the fence For over 3 hours they've been launching missiles... like crazy. but we hope things don't carry on like this. Explain what is going to happen to us. We're not asking that Israel will stay in Lebanon. We're worried that the State of Israel will be the one to bring us down, that's all. We're hanging in there and want to go on. The Israelis are comparing what’s happening to the Israeli army in Lebanon to what happened' to the Americans in Vietnam. It’s ridiculous to see an Israeli soldier leaving Lebanon and kissing the ground upon returning to Israel. It didn't happen?! I don’t know what will happen. their future is uncertain! You never saw me on uniform I want to give a good feeling to the soldiers who say: I'm a simple man too, like every other soldier and I can fight against the Hizbullah. To all our wounded We wish you a speedy recovery We love you! I haven't slept at all. I've been on my feet for 48 hours. I couldn't fall asleep. My thoughts... are with my wife. You're interfering with my work! -Step aside. Get your hand off of me It works according the "Las Vegas treaty". Move aside! We've been filming in Lebanon for the past ten years. And we don't have the last picture. Now they brought in the Military Police in here. Turn around, look Just look at that! "We screwed the journalists, they won't film at the northern border." Hello? It's ringing, but she's not answering, because it’s connected at the border. I want to try talking to her on an international phone line. I'll try, maybe I’ll get through.. Everything's OK. I said everything's OK. How are you, Mom? You can stop worrying now. All right then... Bye, Mom. Hi, Mom. Fine. I'm home. I got through. Hello... how are you? my love. Is everything OK? Are you O.K... OK. She's sitting outside, having coffee at the neighbor’s with her brothers, there's no trouble, no nothing. No one will touch her. She told me: You take care of yourself. "I don't want to lose the house and the merchandise." She have over 4 million dollars worth of merchandise in the warehouse. So she's right and I hope she makes it. if we're lucky... All civilians are ordered to enter the bomb shelters. I'm staying at the Carlton Hotel tonight because I have friends here and I want to at least let off... some of the smoke from the dynamite. See this tag... we all have one of these tags mow. I don't want to say that we’ve become dogs. but we’re not far from it. This afternoon, some Hizbullah men went into my warehouse with someone from the Lebanese security personnel. The warehouse was closed, but they knocked on the door and she was inside, organizing which things to pack, getting things together, making lists and so forth. Hello, ma'am. So they asked her: Where's the boss? She said: "He's in Beirut. In the opposite direction. So they said: "Oh. really? OK. “Would you mind if we searched the place? "We're just looking for weapons, nothing else." Because they saw all that merchandise, so... "If you mind, then we won't search." She said: "No, go ahead." Because... she cleared everything out yesterday. In other words, so far she’s fine, she's fine. she seems to be in a good mood. which means her parents are cheering her up and her brothers came to stay with her, from Beirut. One brother is the director of the Lebanese airline’s office in south Lebanon. I hope she’ll manage, it'll do us a lot of good. Me and her.. we have no problem. Move back! What’s wrong with you? Have you gone crazy? Lebanon is dead. I want to wish you good luck... -Thank you very much. I hope we find a solution. -We made it... Good luck... -We made it, after twenty... Good luck... -After 25 years... Thank you all very much. We do feel at home, really. but after 25 years of peace between South Lebanon and the State of Israel, to achieve peace, you open it! You're absolutely right. I can't cry. It's hard for me*. I'm dying to cry. and Um not a kid anymore. Um .42 years old now, and I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack, and if I do, they can't even take me back there to be buried. It's very hard... and God is Almighty... God is Almighty... Come forward. Dad? You have no idea what's going oh here! War! He's gone, don’t shoot. Be sure the sniper... In the middle In the middle Oh... a woman. She's wounded Slowly, after me, I want to see you jumping, don't run ahead, follow my instructions. Morris, get,your face in that direction, don’t piss me off! You don't want to get shot, do you? Stop.-., stop... If I clear a target I take the shot. Follow the people. See that white battery over there near the road? Try to fire on the right side of the battery, can you do that? The white, not on the people. the white, before the people get there. Go ahead No, buddy, no filming. We made Israel flee from all of south Lebanon. I feel like I'm starting all over again, from zero. I have to build and worry and work all over again... From where we are right now, in northern Israel, my wife is only... a two-minute drive away. She's only 4 kilometers away. And I can't see her. I’m here and the wife's there. We'll collect the honey of Lebanon and rain will fall all across Lebanon. Praise the Prophet who has never let us down. I told the Hizbullah soldiers - If you find out that I was a traitor. you can cut me up with a sword and I won't be angry. They, the Hizbullah, told me they'd cheek it out. I was a cook in, the South Lebanon Army for 3 years and left? I've owned a cafe and restaurant for ten years now. Hizbullah men came to my house and took me away. I was a soldier in the South Lebanon Arm And now you turned yourself in? I turned myself in yesterday. I'm wounded and cannot walk. I have a fractured thigh and leg. Death to Israel! War! War! War! God is great! God is great! You Israelis. don't understand without guns. Our leader Nasaralla promised us we will come here-and we come here. He promised us we will go Will someone tell me Oh. "crazy". I'm crazy Oh. "crazy". I'm sure you have, but you'll loose him here. You'll be destroy forever. To stand on the fence of the north border. looking to the other side and to see who are those people who are standing on the other side of the border, Those are the same people that we used to sit with, eat with. You raise your eyes, and they lower their faces Wild beasts! You have to settle your affairs. and get your wife out of there! How can you sleep at night with your wife alone there? I'll get her out. -What? -﻿I'll get her out. -What? Soon. Hello? Hello, Gabi, I can’t hear you. It’s Samir, Samir. OK. I understands I'm turning to you, I want to ask you for something, Gabi. I want to inform you that my wife was taken away on Friday for interrogation in Sidon and from there she's being taken to the [Defense Ministry in Beirut. the country like everyone else. but Israeli citizenship. Besides being a merchant. I personally did a lot of work for nothing in return?. I'm ﻿not asking for any money., I asked for the minimum of minimum Israeli citizenship. I'm asking you to help me out with that. Thanks, thanks. Thanks. Don't forget this is the General telling me to be in touch. Where do I buy a ticket? Here? There? I expected to be helped. finally I understood that I don't deserve it. One ticket to Nahariya. -A reserved seat? I want a good seat, yeah. I can say my wife was in jail for 22 days. but I've been in jail here, for 3 months now Platform .#1. It’s a jail, but it’s a big jail. that I have lost it. I've lost my family, my business, And I’m like a dog. I was only a merchant...
