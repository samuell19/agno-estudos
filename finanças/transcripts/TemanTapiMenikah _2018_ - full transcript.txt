Hey, To. I'm sorry. Have you been waiting long? I'm so sorry, the shooting took longer than I was expected. The new director is so idealistic, and that's why it took so long. I'm starving. - Have you ordered? - I just ordered coffee. So what's so urgent that you want to see me today? But what a coincidence! I need to tell you something too. Or do you think we should flip a coin to decide who go first? Well? - It's okay, you go first. - Okay... - To, I have big news. - What? While I was on the set, Rifnu asked me to marry him. Can you imagine that? - Really? You're lying, aren't you? - I'm serious. Excuse me. It's from Rifnu. Just a moment. Hello? Hi, I'm with Ditto. Where are you now? Are we still going to meet later? When your best friend is telling you that she's getting married... ... you should be happy for her. But this is different. She's different. The first time I knew Ayu was from TV. Since then, I've never missed an episode of her soap operas. I really had a crush on her. Don't sit too close to the TV, Dear. - Happy Birthday! - Thank you! She was like an angel to me. An angel that lived in my TV. - Get back. - Ow, ow, ow! But even with my eyes glued to the TV, we were living in two different worlds. What do you call a stupid fish? Do you know it? It's puffer fish. They keep playing in the water even after they know they are bloating. And I found out that she was not an angel. She was a real person. Hello, is this seat taken? I'm Ayu. I'm Ditto. My closest friends usually call me Ucha... ... but you can call me whatever you want. Of course, I didn't want to be one of her regular friends. I wanted to be one of her best friends who calls her... ... Ucha! - You forgot your pen. - Thanks. And apparently, like me, she too loves music. So I asked her to join our band in junior high... ... as my justification of why I was always around her. And when I was little I could only see her on TV. Now I can watch her acting on the set. Live. You look so cool. I wonder what you can't do. I'm still wondering about that too. You're getting cocky. Stop it! Stay away from me! Ditto. You're acting like kids. Here's some snacks. Thanks, Auntie. I don't like you making Ditto skip classes. It's near the finals. You need to be more dilligent in your studies. That's not true, Auntie. I've never made him skip class... ... he likes to follow me to the set. Are you going to join the band in high school too? I don't think so. I want to focus on acting more. - Of course, because she can't sing. - Shut up! I've heard that you're going to the same high school. Yes, Auntie. So fed up. Did you two do that on purpose? Why does this feel like an interrogation, mom? Because you look like you're dating each other... ... always hanging around each other. Mom, stop it! That's absurd. His type of girl is like a princess. Of course! Not a dirty girl like you. We'll see. Watch it. If you ever fall for me,... ... I'm going to hate you for the rest of my life. Sorry to keep you waiting. Rifnu and I are planning to introduce our families. You don't look happy. Yeah, sorry about that. First love is not easy to forget. Especially when it involves your best friend. Believe me, I've tried every possible ways. You don't have to be so crazy all the time. It's one of the downside to have a cool friend like me. You're so full of yourself. You don't have to be so jealous. Who are you calling jealous? Come here you! Jerk! Oh my god, he's so handsome! Who, Ditto? Are you sure? You should check your eyes. By the way, can you introduce us? - I know he's your best friend. - Why don't you introduce yourself?. I'm too shy. Please? Okay... Thank you, Yu! Two siomay... One chocolate... To, there's someone who wants to meet you! Sorry. - Mili. - Ditto. Now you're officially met. I'm going away. Bye! - Ucha! - What? I can't hear you! - Why did you introduce me to Mili? - Because she forced me to. I didn't want to be a pain, so I introduced her to you. But isn't it your goal to act all cool and get a girlfriend, right? You've accomplished that goal. Aren't you happy? Are you okay with this? What was that? Good, To. Teach her instead of, letting her copy your homework. - She thinks it's okay to do that. - It is okay to do that. It's not. Don't let her copy your homework again. Yes, Auntie. So you're okay if I'm dating Mili? Don't bring it up anymore, To. Instead of thinking about that all the time,... ... why don't you start helping me with my homework, okay? Pretty please. Come on. Okay... Someone's close with a senior, huh? Why are you so curious about my private life? Don't get too excited, and your nostrils are twitching. Ditto, don't start. I think you'd better pay closer attention to Mili than my nose. Where is she anyway? She went to me again this morning. What did you do to her? I didn't do anything to her. She poured everything to me about you getting close to her,... ... but you didn't even ask her out yet. If you don't like her, just be honest. - Why did she tell you that? - How should I know? You handle it. It's tiring me out, you know. Tell her how you honestly feel. Hurry up. Mili, can we talk? We're going to get some food. - Of course. What is it about? - What did you tell Ayu? - I didn't tell her much. - Are you sure? You didn't tell her about us? Okay, I did. But only because I thought she's your best friend. I can't tell her about us? Do you have any idea, you are making her... Making her upset. What do you want? To officially be your girlfriend? Huh? - Okay. - Really? Congrats! Look at this new couple. Check this out, look at the new couple. Are you going home together? You look so cute together. Bye! Do you want to go out for a date tonight? Maybe watch a movie? Dit... - Ditto! Are you listening to me? - I did! I forgot to do my homework. I'd better go now. Bye! After that, you should run a lap around the field. Nude. Go back. Hey... Looks like somebody is officially dating with somebody. I bet Darma conffesed his love for you by singing, right? I know some tricks of how boys from a band to get a girl. So boring, you know. Have you do your homework? Can I copy it? - Lend it to me. - No. Never. - Lend it to me! - Ask your new boyfriend! Shut up, Ditto. Give me your homework. - No. - You're being stingy right now. That's right... Thank you. By the way, his song is so cheesy. He's lucky 'cause he's hot, it saved him. I knew it. But I have to admit, he's good at playing the guitar. Very skilled. Ditto... Ditto! Dit, why are you doing that? Always leaving me behind. We never walk together. At least pick me up from my class. You've got to be kidding me. You want me to pick you up just for going to the canteen? What am I, a driver? You don't care about me. Alright, tommorow I'll pick you up at your class before we go to the canteen. Satisfied? Happy? Thrilled? I'm happy! That's more like it. Now that's what I call a good boyfriend. [ School Band Audition - Be The Star ] - You're so kind. Dit... Ditto...? Ditto! - Is he really in the first year? - Really? He has my vote. - He's good. - What do you think? - I like it. I think it's okay. Yeah it's alright, but you should practice more. Ditto! - Ditto. - Huh? Am I your girlfriend or just an accessory to you? I'm not just a ride on some amusement park that you ride only if you feel like it. Huh? I want to break up with you. - I don't feel like we're dating, anyway. - Oh, okay. Ditto! I am breaking up with you. Yeah, so? I can't tell her that I'm bored of her. I kind of feel sorry for her. Whatever. You can date as many girls as you like now. That way when it's time to get married, you'd settle with just one girl. You know? Get married? You're thinking about getting married now? I know why. I bet it's because you're so in love now,... ... everything seems like a dream... Did he startled you? I've got to go. Bye! Mom, Dad,... ... I think it will be more efficient for me if you let me drive a car. Just be honest and say you want us to buy you a car. You're so smart, Mom. You can read my mind. It will be more efficient if you buy your own car. - Shut up. - Eat your dinner. Hello? What is it, Cha? Can I ask you a favor? Please? It's urgent, I need your help. Okay, I'll be right there. To! Thank you so much. You're so kind. Thank you so much. I need the dress for a scene continuity and I forgot to bring it to the set. The crew would kill me. But why did you make me your delivery boy? - Where's your boyfriend? - I don't know where he is. I can't contact him when I needed him the most. - You don't like helping your friend? - Where did you get that idea? Even now I'm still doing your homework. - You're still on the set this late? - I know, right? And I'm exhausted. Do you want to leave? It's okay if you want to leave. It's okay, I'll stay until you're done. That's the way... Cha. I want to buy a car. But my Dad said I should buy it with my own money. Then get a job, like me. Acting in soaps like you? No way! No, that's not what I mean. Get a job that you love. I like acting, hence I'm an actress. What's your passion? Music. Percussion. You can start from that, and save the money to buy a car. Plain and simple. Or what if I can buy a scooter instead. It's a lot cheaper and easier to get. Fine, as long as I'm the first person that you'll give a ride to. Deal! I don't know what charm she has, but whatever she said... ... seems to motivate me. More than world class motivators. I love your performance. I can't believe you did it! Thanks. And thanks for coming to see my gig. Of course, silly. I want to come, this is your first gig after all. - But don't forget, save the money. - Of course, I'll save the money. - Good job. - But wait, this is my first gig. Why don't I buy you dinner with the money instead? Stop acting like you're loaded. This is your first income, don't waste it. Take it as a celebration of my first income. Okay? Fine. - What do you want to order? - Sorry I'm late. You just missed his awesome performance. It's a shame. - Really? - Yeah. And he's going to pay for our dinner with his first salary. - Aren't you, Ditto? - That will be great. Yeah, but... I've changed my mind. I just realized... that you were right. I'd better save the money, for my future. Okay. Ditto! Ditto... Are you thirsty, Ditto? - Here. - Thanks. Thanks for the water. Ditto, you can thank me by exchanging numbers? One sparkling water, and can you make it fast? Of course, wait a moment. When did you start dating? Around 2 weeks ago? Is that so? Yeah, around that time. - But we never made it official. - Yeah. All of a sudden, we just hang out more often... ... and talk, and... love grew. Slowly but surely, just like a snail. Your water, Miss. Excuse me, this is not sparkling water. Do you understand what sparkling water is? - Replace it now. - Yes, right away. I'm sorry, Miss. Isn't it annoying if they didn't bring you the correct order? And you still have to pay for their mistake. Yeah, but I usually don't make it a big problem. I don't want to make too much of a fuss. - But you've never ordered anything. - What do you mean? - You only eat soto, siomay, or satai. - Of course! Long live Pak Mamat! You're right, long live Pak Mamat! - What is Pak Mamat? - The food stall accross the school. I think you love Pak Mamat more than you love me. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do! - What? That's absurd. - I know you do. What do you always say if Pak Mamat's not open? - What? - "Where's Pak Mamat?" "Why is he not open today?" "Is he sick? He won't reply my texts!" I've never texted Pak Mamat! - You texted him a lot! - You're making things up. - Admit it. You're just making that up! I've never eat street food. I can't comment on that. That's unfortunate. You're missing out a lot. - Why? - His soto is so good! Totally! Your water, Miss. Why isn't it chilled?! I have to go home. Bye! - Dump her. - What? She's so fake! I hate her. And who's forcing you to date Acha? I'm serious, she's not good for you. Trust me on this. What's the problem? We don't have to like each others' boyfriends and girlfriends, okay. But you like Darma. - You really think that? That conceited guy? - He has never been conceited to you. You're the one that's been competitive with him. Admit it. You're the one that's being competitive, with his phone. Have you even noticed it? Everytime we hang out,... ... he's busy with his phone. - Maybe he's texting another girl? - Don't accuse him of cheating all of a sudden. I know a cheater when I see one. He's showing all the signs. He got bored with you, and he'll dump you soon. Are you asking me to punch you? Huh? And you always act so sweet and cute around him. Do you realize that you're not being yourself around him? Why not? If he likes me that way, then what's the problem? It's none of your business anyway. I have to go to the bathroom. Hello, Cha. Hello. What is it, Cha? - You were right, To. - What? Your voice is too soft. Talk louder. You were right all along. He's cheating on me. What? I can't hear you. It's too noisy. I'll call you back. Bye! Ucha! To! Cha! Scream it, Cha! - Darma is a jerk! - What? - You're a dogflea, Darma! - That's not even rude! You're a bag of crap, Darma! One of your dreams finally came true. I'm so proud of you. I should thank you for that. Cha... Dump Darma, and be my girlfriend. To... To. Hey! Seriously, I thought you got possessed. Sorry, I got too immersed in your sadness Jerk. Cha, don't be sad. Don't waste your time crying over that cheater. I know that,... ... but it still hurts. I wish I gave him more attention, so he wouldn't cheat on me. Well... ... I don't know about that. But you shouldn't be this stupid, either. Forget him. There are still many boys who likes you. But I still love him. You should be more selective next time. Aren't you tired of getting hurt? Do you really believe that you can choose who you're going to give your love to? That's not possible, is it? Somebody told me that love... ... is like waiting for a bus in a shelter. I know. If you missed your bus, you're screwed. Is that what you meant? But it's not just that. There are plenty of buses stopping on the shelter. But you have to take the one that will carry you to your chosen destination. Do you mean I have to wait until my bus arrives on the shelter? That's too deep. And... You should know which bus you should take. Don't tell me you already know which bus you should take. - I do. - Which one? I won't tell you. Just that I can't ride that bus yet because I don't have enough money. But you're already on Acha's bus. Are you saying that you want to ride two buses at once? You're no better than Darma! No way. I'm like that. There, there. Stop being sad. It's always Ayu and Ayu again. Fine, I know you are besties. But why did you let her ride your scooter before me? - Cha. - It's over, Ditto. I can't take it anymore. I'm breaking up with you. - I won't cry. I won't be upset. - That's great, Cha. It will make me stronger someday. In that very moment, I feel it was the time to prove... ... that I'm the one that will never make her cry. I will prove to her that I will always be there for her. That I can be the guy she can be proud of. [ Science Class ] [ No. 19, M. Pradana Budiarto (Ditto) ] [ Social Class ] [ No. 4, Ayudia Chaerani ] Hello, Auntie. What happened? All right, I'll tell Ditto. Okay, Auntie. Hello? I can't hear you. Hold on. - I've got to take this call. - Okay. Hello, Cha? Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. What is it? - Are you crazy? - What are you talking about, doc? You haven't examined me yet and you've already diagnosed me as crazy? What is it? Do you really want to switch your class from Science to Social? Oh, that. Your Mom called me, you know. You're not making any sense at all. Cha, I'm a busy person. I have football practice, rehearsing for the band. And I'm running for the student council president. - I don't have time to study. - That's not a valid reason. I know you, you're not good at memorizing things. And you think you can survive Social? You think you know everything, don't you? They have accounting class and that counts as math too! Everybody wants to be put in Science class... ... and you switched to Social class instead. - I hope it's not because of a girl. - No way! I don't want to become a doctor, I don't need to go into Science. It's unnecessary. Alright. Just explain it to your Mom, okay? - Explain it honestly and clearly. - Okay. If you vote for me as the president this year,... ... I will do whatever it takes to end school brawls in our school. We should channel our energy into positive activities,... ... such as art competitions and sports. I want to make our soccer and basketball team to be even better. We can achieve all of that, but only if you vote for me. Thank you. Ditto... - Ditto. - Hi. - Hi. - Easy, loverboy. You can stop flirting with girls once in a while. You'd know if you've found the right girl. The one I'm looking for is still far from my grasp. - Like you've already found her. - I did. Who? Ay... ...ngelina Jolie! Idiot. - Excuse me, Mom. - What? - Where's the remote? - But I'm watching TV. - Are you on TV tonight? - Wait. - There! That's Ditto, Mom! - Oh my God. Ditto's on TV? He's awesome! Oh my God. He's so awesome, Mom. - Cha, are you watching TV right now? - I'm watching him right now, Auntie. I still can't believe he's on TV. And he looks so weird! I know, I think he was born that way. Okay, I'm going to continue watching. Okay, Auntie. Bye! - To! - Hey! You were amazing last night! That was so cool! - I know, right? - How did you do that? I can do anything, it's me after all. Okay, calm down. You can take my picture later. - Sorry, I'm busy now. - You're so full of yourself. But, seriously, you were awesome. I'm so proud of you. I know it's awesome. Ditto, you know! I mean seriously, that's how yesterday was a huge one. - You didn't feel nervous at all? - Nope, it's all good. I always go into trance when I'm playing percussion. You should feel flattered. Me, a popular actress, giving you a sincere compliment. - A newcomer musician like you. - There you go again. Don't forget, I often appear on TV too. You're not the only one. - I'm a celebrity now. - You're getting cocky now. You bet I am! But don't forget, always save some of your money. Everyone can be humble if they don't have any money. But I can't say the same for rich people. Don't ever forget that. Don't worry, I'm saving my money. I still owe you a promise, right? But if it's about humble... Well, let me think about that. Okay? And you have to call me Ditto "Percushion". Mr. Ditto "Percushion". It's percussion, idiot. Mister? Cha... - Will you be my date to the prom? - I don't know... I can't go to the prom with a newcomer musician. But I do want to go to the prom with my best friend! - Drama queen. - Of course, I'm an actress! Where have you been? What took you so long? I'm sorry, Auntie. I was on my way here.... ... but I realized I was still wearing sandals. Alright, now, both of you sit on the scooter. I'm going to take a picture. Let's go. Alright, let's take a picture. One, two... Okay. One, two, three! You sure you're okay riding the scooter wearing that gown? Yeah, no problem. - Drive carefully, To. - I will, Auntie. My makeup is ruined. What's the big deal? As if they won't recognize you. I promise, when I get my car, even makeup on your toes will stay on. Because my big toes need makeup too. So that your face isn't the only pretty one. Are you saying that I'm pretty? Congrats. You won't hear that often from me. Send me the certificate. Cha. Do you realize that we're about to go to college? I know, time flies by so quickly. I'm going to miss this school. Just the school? You're not going to miss anything else? What do you mean? No, nevermind. Cha, I... You what? Actually,... Actually, I... That's my song! Hold my cup! Time passes by. And before we realize it high school life is almost over. [ Sound Solution - Rainbow Cake ] That night, I've made up my mind to tell her how I feel. [ State University Admission ] [ Test Result ] 10-14-80696. Your number's not here. It's alright, Dear. It doesn't matter if you are studying... ... in a state university or in a private university. They're all the same. Don't get too upset. And even if you're not accepted to a state university,... ... that doesn't mean that your're stupid. - That's not why I'm upset, Cha. - Then what, Ditto? - I have to go to Bandung. - It's only Bandung, it's not that far. But we won't be in the same city. - You can always call me. - It's far away. Then, drive a car, don't walk to Bandung. Bandung is so close anyway. Why are you being dramatic? What makes it so hard for you to leave? All my gigs are in Jakarta. And I live in Bandung. - It's way too far. - I know you'll find a way. It just depends on how you manage your time. I know you can do it, okay? So it's okay if I go to Bandung? Of course, don't be an idiot. Wait, I know that car! Are you going out with Darma? - But you're not back with him, are you? - Shush, I'm not in the mood for a lecture. He already said that he's sorry, and he admitted that he's wrong. So stop complaining, okay? Bye! The truth is, I was ready not to go to college in Bandung for Ucha's sake. So that I wouldn't be far away from her. But I think all the roads to win her have all been closed for me. Maybe it's not my destiny to have her. And maybe going to Bandung is the best for both of us. Are you sure you're not coming with us to Bandung? I actually want to go with you,... ... but I'm scheduled for a shooting after this. I understand. - Take care, Cha. - Come home often, will you? - Bye... - To. My days will be lonely without you. Cha... The first person to cry has to buy us a meal! - Why do I have to cry for you? - You're going to miss me. - It's the other way around. - No, it's you. No, you. See, I can see tears gathering in your eyes. No, I won't. You're the one that's going to cry because you're a crybaby. This is my way of escaping. Escaping for the sake of our friendship. Escaping to protect our feelings. Bye. Maybe... this is what's best for me. Dear... Maybe this way, I can get over my feelings for her. My life will be lonely without her. Okay, I just left campus. I'm on my way. Okay. The crowd in Bandung is so much fun. The girls here are just like you. They love to scream and jump around. It's awesome. - How are you doing these days? - I broke up again with Darma. Alhamdulillah! Finally you've broken up with that guy! Congratulations! Thanks. How many 'neng geulis' have you been dating there? A lot? Nope. I'm not focusing on that, only on getting good grades. Amazing, in just a few months and you've repented. Even a playboy needs a break. Are you saying that you're saving energy for the finish line? When are you going to get back? I want you to bring me Siomay Bandung. Please come home. Even living in Bandung can't stop you from making me your delivery man. Of course. Finally! Finally I'm here? Or finally you can eat? Both. So you like me only about as much as you like siomay? Thank you, they look so delicious. - You're welcome. - Have a bite. Sorry. - Are you majoring in philosophy? - No. I'm majoring in management. Why are you reading philosophy book then? I'm just curious. I think if you want to manage people, you have to know their mindset. Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm too serious? No, not that. On the contrary, I think it's so cool that you've thought that far ahead. By the way, I'm Dila. Ditto. Ditto! - Hi, babe. - Hi. - I've got these for you! - Okay, I'll go get my bag first. Okay. - You're tired, aren't you? - Yeah. Are you done? Here. To... Valentine's Day is coming. Aren't we going to plan something? Let's do something. - Happy Valentine's Day. - Thank you. - Dila. - Yes. If you got bored waiting for me playing on the stage,... ... it's okay to stay home next time. Who said I got bored? No one, but I saw you busy with your phone. Oh my God, Ditto. I was just on my phone a few times. You're too sensitive. Hey, please don't get upset. Today is Valentine's Day. Don't you want to take me to dinner or do romantic stuff together. - Dinner? - Yeah. Thank you, Nu. It's the best Valentine's Day ever. You're welcome. Ditto! This is romantic, you know? We're eating on a sidewalk, and it's raining. And I'm spoon feeding you. Isn't it romantic? We're eating batagor, because we're anti-mainstream. Oh my God. Whose car did you borrow? Hey, watch it! Isn't it cool? Somebody told me that if I wanted a car,... ... I should work hard to buy one. Are you serious, this is really your car? Gosh, you've finally got your car. You're so amazing! Okay, let's go. Let's drive around. Wait a moment. Where are you going? You don't need to change. I need to put makeup on my toes first, remember? Just get in the car. So this is what you get for three years of saving money. Are you proud of me? I'm so proud of you. You're so amazing. I might play around with girls. But I don't play around with my promise. - Look who's bragging about himself. - You bet I am! Okay, fine. Just for tonight, you're allowed to brag. - Are you sure? - I won't complain. Go ahead. You have to call me Ditto "The Great- The Percussion Master... ... The Cool-And The Handsome". Damn it! What? I can't hear you! It's been so long since the last time I ate here. The last time I ate here was with you. Remember? - When was that? Was it in 11th grade? - Yeah it was in 11th grade. - This looks so delicious. - Thank you. Was your girlfriend excited when she saw your new car? She doesn't know yet. I drove this car here the moment I paid for it. Gosh, I'm that special to you. I think being your best friend is better than being your girlfriend. It's obvious, you know. I believe in 'bros before hoes'. Oh, yeah? What's that? Huh? It's like, girlfriend is here. Bestfriend is up here. It's different. That's how I'll explain it. Your English is getting better. - Yes. - Good for you. - Yes, of course. I go to college, you know. - Idiot. Cha... A scooter, check. A car, check. - What's next? - The next thing is... ... graduate from college, get married, buy a house... ... and have children. So that's all life is about, is it? If you want to discuss about the meaning of life,... ... I need more than just satay. How's that? - That's just you still hungry. - How did you know that? We should have a double date. I'll bring Rifnu, and you bring Dila. What do you think? Okay. But I have to check my schedule. Because starting from next weekend, I will be fully booked until next month. - You're a super busy girl. - Of course! Actress! I swear, Pak Mamat was like this... - Right? - Totally. He was like... You look so ugly. So crazy. Sorry, it's an old story. Let me tell you something, in high school Ditto was... - Ucha, shut up! - What are you doing? - Don't gossip about me. - Who is Pak Mamat? You don't want to know. You'd be sorry you asked. I know you're curious. So, Pak Mamat was... Don't start! Shut up! Ditto, stop it! Is wet, you jerk. I can see why you two are friends. You both are pranksters. Of course, because Ucha is my... - What's the word? - What do you want to say? I'm looking for the term for... Okay, Ucha is my cleavage! - He means I'm his soulsister. - Okay... Then what is Dila to you? That's where you're wrong. She's my soulmate, right? Right? Nice move, man. Okay, let's change topic. Where did you two met? - I'm going to let Ayu tell you. - You tell them. - No, you tell them. - You. - No, you. - But I'm embarrased. - You tell them, please. - Okay. All right. We have a mutual friend, and she introduced us. Then we exchanged numbers, and one thing leads to another. You've been besties for 9 years, but you've never dated her? Never. Oh boy. When a girl makes that sound, it's usually trouble. It's just that... I find it strange. And a bit doubtful. A boy and a girl, being besties without having feelings for each other? I do have feelings for her. But feelings like a best friend. - I'm serious, Ditto. - So am I. Have you ever been in love with her? We're just friends, that's it. How often are you contacting each other? Not often. She's busy with her life too. She has classes to attend, shooting schedules, and her boyfriend. Do you have any goals after graduation? Get a job maybe? And playing percussion. You don't have any other goals? Nope. Why do you ask? Goals like build a family, or get married, maybe? My goal is to get married early. It will be nice to have a small family, with cute babies... I wonder who the baby will look like. Me or you? Look, so cute! And our age gap to our children won't be too wide. When they graduate from college, we won't have grey hair yet. And I think our relationship is getting serious. And in terms of income, we're qualifed for a mortgage, right? I think we're ready to take our relationship to the next level,... ... don't you think so? Can I rehearse for a minute? Of course you can. I was only wondering aloud. - Okay. - I'll start rehearsing, Ok? - Get fired up. Bye. Ditto! Dit... Dit... Ditto! I've been screaming your name, didn't you hear me? - Really? I didn't hear you at all. - I want to show you something. Look at this. It's cute, isn't it? What is that? This baby picture is the fusion image of our faces. So our baby would probably look like this. It's so cute. It has your eyes and your lips too. What? You want to break up with Dila? - You're crazy. Come on! - I don't know what else to do. She keeps talking about getting married. She has given you 4 years of her life! But you've never thought about proposing to her at all? I love Dila, I swear. I love her so much. But I can't picture my future with her. Ditto, you're not a teenager anymore. If you still don't know what commitment is,... ... then you shouldn't have a girlfriend. I know you think I'm a jerk. But I'm going to prove it to you. if I get married, I will totally commit to her for the rest of my life. Commitment and faithfulness takes time and effort. There is no instant formula. Okay? Bye. That was a long call. Who was it? Ditto told me he wants to break up with Dila. - Ditto? - I think he's going crazy. What's the point of dating her for 4 years... ... when he doesn't really love her? Why bother, right? I can understand it when he was a teenager he wanted to have... ... as many girlfriends as he could. And when he gets older, he's ready for a commitment. - But at his age now? - Can we talk about Ditto later? Okay, but I just don't get it. How is it possible... It is. Anyone who wants to split up, can. A married couple of 30 years can still get divorced. It's all about choices. Like me who chose to eat alone for half an hour... ... while you were on the phone with another man. Was it that long? I'm so sorry. And he chose... to forgive his girlfriend. Because he loves her so much. You're so sweet. Can you forgive me? Now eat, your food is getting cold. Taste this. - Are you serious? - Yeah, that's okay. All right. I hope we can still this romantic until we're old and gray. How come you never answer my questions about us. But I think I know the answer. Ayu. Why are we talking about her? To... You pour yourself into percussion because she told you to, am I right? You saved your money to buy a car... ... also because of your promise to her. All of your accomplishments... ... and all your hard work. You did them for Ayu, didn't you? We've been dating for 4 years. I've been separating you for 4 years, and I'm still in her shadow. I should've broken up with you long ago, but I was too stubborn. I wanted to be the number 1 person in your life. I thought I could compete with your Ucha, I was so confident. But... no matter how hard I try... I can never beat her. I give up. I've been keeping my feelings inside, because I was afraid. You can't stay silent. Do you think love is easy? Suddenly it's there, and suddenly everything is beautiful? If you don't run after her, you won't ever catch her. You can keep your feelings inside yourself. But don't expect her to know if you don't show her. On that very moment, I've made up my mind. Whatever happens, I have to tell her how I feel. Sorry for keeping you waiting. Rifnu and I are planning to introduce our families. You don't look happy. What's wrong? I'm getting married, it's big news. Can your face be a bit more expressive? Yeah, I'm sorry, Cha. I'm still processing that. I can't believe there's a man who actually wants to marry you. I'm kidding, Cha. - Congrats. - Thanks, Ditto. - I'm happy for you. - Thanks. Let me tell you something. I didn't expect this... ... So I was on the set and Rifnu proposed over the phone. I didn't know what to say, but I'm so in love with him. - Where did you park your car? - Over there. - Okay, I'll walk you to your car. - Okay... I thought you have something urgent to tell me. I'm sorry, it was because I was so busy talking about Rifnu. I forgot to ask you. What did you want to tell me? - Nah, it's not that urgent. - I don't believe it. You've come all the way from Bandung. - Just forget about it, it's nothing. - Come on, I can see it in your face... Dila broke up with me. I'm so sorry, and I was talking about me all the time. Are you okay? But I don't understand, why? It's... Because she found out I don't really love her. It's always the same old problem. You're not a teenager anymore, To. You have to change. Yeah, it's always the same old problem. I've never changed. I thought I have, but apparently I have not. Maybe it's because I'm already in love with someone since 12 years ago. I have to tell her tonight. I can't hold my feelings any longer. If I don't tell her tonight, she won't know how I truly feel about her. Wait, those lines seems familiar. Where did I hear them before? I stole them from your soap. Okay. Well, go on. I know this isn't the right time. But I'm in love with you. You're kidding, right? Do you mean the girl that you love for 12 years is me? Are you out of your mind? You are so messed up. I have to leave. I'm meeting Rifnu tonight. Cha... Yu... Are you okay? I met Ditto last night. He told me that he loves me. Is he out of his mind? He said he's been in love with me for 12 years! Can you imagine that? And I thought our relationship is strictly about friendship. But, it turns out he feels differently. I was so disgusted. I told him everything. I mean, everything. And how dare him telling me that, after I told him we're getting married. He's out of his mind. I feel so betrayed. If the feeling is not mutual, you won't be this stressed out about it. That's not it. You don't realize it, but you talk so much about Ditto. He did a gig here, a gig there, or he was on TV. And you tell him everything first. When you signed up for a new series, you told him first. I feel like I'm dating both you and Ditto. And sometimes it feels like I'm just the third wheel. I know he's important to you. When I asked you to marry me, I was prepared that... ... we're going to talk about Ditto for the rest of our lives. - But this kind of discussion... - No, I promise you. I won't ever mention his name again. I will never contact him again. And we won't hang out with him ever again. I promise. You don't have to promise me anything. Think about it first. I won't go anywhere. Okay, today I want to discuss about love. But first, I want to ask the audience. Is there any of you that have fallen in love with your best friend? - No. - Nobody? Are you sure? Oh my God, that's so sad. Then you have no good looking best friend. Okay, then, I'll just ask Ditto. Have you ever been in love with your best friend? Well... The look on your face tells me that you have. - Well, I have. - Tell me about it. But I'm embarrased. Don't be so embarassed. You are paid to be my victim anyway. Spill it. They're waiting. Okay, it's like this... Well, we've been besties since junior high. I watched all her shows on TV, she's an actress, by the way. I fell in love with her very much, but I didn't have the courage to tell her. Because I was afraid. Then, we went to the same high school. And I still couldn't muster enough courage to tell her. And I was still too afraid to say anything. I'm a shamed of myself. Because I felt like I need to be a guy she could be proud of. I want to have a successful career first. I even tried to compete with her boyfriend. You went that far? I thought that I have to prepare so when it's time to confess to her... ... I'm already a sucessful person. - But did you finally tell her? - I did. - And then? - She said no. I'm so sorry for you, Ditto. Did you crawl up inside your percussion? Did you regret that you told her and she said no? I didn't regret it one bit. Because I really love her. And she needs to know how I feel. The only regret is that now I feel that I've lost her. Yu, why do I keep hearing Ditto's voice? Maybe you miss him. You keep talking about him all day. - Take a bath. It's already noon. - Okay. But when I finally told you, what did you do? You want to leave me, isn't it? You can hate me. You can cast me away from your life. But my feelings for you will never change. And if you choose to leave, I understand. But mark my words, one day you'll realize... ... no one can ever love you as much as I love you. Yu, your line. It's your turn. So presumptuous of you to say that no one can love me... ... as much as you love me? Do you think you're the only one in this world that loves me? Cut! Ayu, is that a line from another soap opera? Oh my God. I'm so sorry. This must be soaps overdose. - Hey, Ucha. - Is Ditto home? He just left. He said he has to do a tour in Bali for a week. Thank you. To... - Can you hold my phone? - Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4. Ditto! To! Ditto! Excuse me! - Have you seen Daniel? - No. Iqbaal! Iqbaal! Excuse me. Sorry, Miss. You need to have a backstage pass to enter. - But how come you let them enter. - They're from Iqbaal's fan club. Hello? Iqbaal! - Have you seen Daniel? - No. I told you, this is a resctricted area. It's okay. She's a friend of mine. Well, Miss... ... you need a backstage pass to get in here? Is that so? Don't you know who I am? Who are you anyway? I'm besties with the percussion guy, Ditto what's his name. Cocky aren't you? I have a lot of fans, you know. Those girls you saw screaming Iqbaal's name? - They were actually my fans. - I don't buy that one bit. There's one fan right here. She went all the way from Jakarta just to see me. - You miss me, don't you? - Don't get cocky. She touched me! You want me that bad already? You're the one that wants me for the past 12 years. And you told everybody on national television! And you think I wouldn't know? Where have you been? I thought you went back to Jakarta without me. What? Are you regretting you said you love me? Why are you acting so weird? I didn't expect it to be this soon. Will you, in this one lifetime of yours, be me wife? Wait. Are you sure you're proposing me with an empty box? It's not empty. Sorry. Will you take me as your husband, Cha? So that you can marry your best friend. You will? You're out of your mind. I've never thought you'd propose this quickly. Quick for you, but for me it's been 12 years waiting. Not now! I didn't lean in to kiss you. I just wanted to check your breath. Idiot. I've been waiting 12 years for this moment. 12 years filled with struggles. But her love is worth the effort. Let's just do that later. Stand back, you're creeping me out. I accept Ayudia Chaerani binti Firmansyah... ... to be my lawfully wedded wife with the dowry as mentioned. - Witnesses, are they officially married? - Yes, they are! Every step we take, both the right and the wrong ones... ... have lead us to this day. Ayu is my past, my present, and will always be my future. It's true what they said... ... first love isn't something you can easily forget. Especially if your first love is also your best friend. And that's why I married my best friend.
