[ Train Whistle Blowing ] [ Gasping ] [ Train Whistle Blowing ] You see? You see the symbolism of it? Capital and Labor destroy each other. lt teaches a moral lesson. lt has social significance. Who wants to see that kind of stuff? lt gives me the creeps. - Tell him how long it played in the Music Hall. - lt was held over a fifth week. Who goes to the Music Hall? Communists! Communists? This picture's an answer to Communists! lt shows we're awake and not dunking our heads in the sand like a bunch of ostriches! l want this picture to be a commentary on modern conditions. Stark realism─ the problems that confront the average man. - But with a little sex. - A little, but l don't want to stress it. l want this picture to be a document. l want to hold a mirror up to life. l want this to be a picture of dignity. . . a true canvas of the suffering of humanity. - But with a little sex. - With a little sex in it. - How about a nice musical? - How can you talk about musicals at a time like this. . . with the world committing suicide? With corpses piling up in the street. With grim Death gargling at you from every corner. - With people slaughtered like sheep! - Maybe they'd like to forget that. Why did they hold this over for a fifth week at the Music Hall─ for the ushers? - lt died in Pittsburgh. - Like a dog. - What do they know in Pittsburgh? - They know what they like. lf they knew what they liked, they wouldn't live in Pittsburgh. That's no argument. lf you pandered to the public, you'd still be in the horse age. - You think we're not? Look at Hopalong Cassidy. - You look at him. We'd still be making Keystone chases, bathing beauties, custard pie operas. - And a fortune. - A fortune. Of course, I'm just a minor employee here, Mr. LeBrand. He's starting that one again. l wanted to make you something outstanding─ something you could be proud of. . . something that would realize the potentialities of film. . . as the sociological and artistic medium that it is. - [ Murmurs ] - With a little sex in it. Something like─ - Something like Capra. l know. - What's the matter with Capra? - Look, you want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou? - Yes. - Now, wait a minute! - Then go ahead and make it! For what you're getting, l can't afford to argue with you. That's a fine way to start a man out on a million-dollar production. You want it, you've got it! l can take it on the chin. I've taken it before. - Not from me you haven't. - Not from you, Sully, that's true. Not with pictures like So Long Sarong... Hey, Hey, in the Hayloft, Ants in Your Plants of 1 939. But they weren't about tramps, lockouts, sweatshops. . . people eating garbage in alleys and living in piano boxes and ash cans and─ - And phooey! - They're about nice, clean young people. . . who fell in love─ with laughter and music and legs. - Take that scene in Hey, Hey, in the Hayloft— - But conditions have changed. There isn't any work. There isn't any food. - These are troublous times. - What do you know about trouble? - What do l know about trouble? - Yes, what do you know about trouble? - What do you mean what do l know about trouble? - Just what I'm saying. You want to make a picture about garbage cans. What do you know about garbage cans? When did you eat your last meal out of one? - What's that got to do with it? - He's asking you. You want to make an epic about misery, show hungry people sleeping in doorways. - With newspapers around them. - You want to grind 1 0,000 feet of hard luck. - All I'm asking you is, what do you know about hard luck? - Yes! - What do l know about hard luck? Don't you think I've─ - No. - What? - You have not. l sold newspapers till l was 20. Then l worked in a shoe store and put myself through law school at night. - Where were you at 20? - l was in college. When l was 1 3, l supported three sisters, two brothers and a widowed mother. - Where were you at 1 3? - l was in boarding school. - I'm sorry. - You don't have to be ashamed of it, Sully. That's the reason your pictures have been so light, so cheerful, so inspiring. They don't stink with messages. That's why I paid you 500 a week when you were 24. - 750 when you were 25. - 1 ,000 when you were 26. - When l was 26, l was getting 1 8. - 2,000 when you were 27. - l was getting 25 then. - I'd just opened─ 3,000 after Thanks for Yesterday. 4 ,000 after Ants in Your Plants. l suppose you're trying to tell me l don't know what trouble is. - Yes! - ln a nice way, Sully. You're absolutely right. l haven't any idea what it is. People always like what they don't know anything about. l certainly had a lot of nerve wanting to make a picture about human suffering. You're a gentleman to admit it, Sully. But then, you are anyway. How about making Ants in Your Plants of 1 941 ? - You can have Bob Hope, Mary Martin─ - Maybe Bing Crosby. - The Abbott Dancers. - Maybe Jack Benny and Rochester. - A big-name band. - What? Oh, no. l want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou? But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do first. I'm going down to Wardrobe and get some old clothes, some old shoes. - Huh? - I'm gonna start out with 1 0 cents in my pocket. - What? - l don't know where I'm going, but I'm not coming back till I know what trouble is. - What? - Don't worry. You can take me off salary. Who's talking about taking you off salary? - So long. And thanks for the idea. - Wait a minute! Don't be so impulsive. - How soon will you be back? - Maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe a year. Don't worry about me. And thanks, Dracula. - You gave me a great idea. - l gave you─ - Now look what you've done. - What I've done? With your lies about selling newspapers! l sold as many newspapers as you supported a family at 1 3. - l opened a shooting gallery. - With money you borrowed from your uncle. - We better insure him for a million. - He's worth more. - The bonehead. - Yes, but what a genius. Get me a copy of that O Brother, Where Art Thou? l guess I'll have to read it now. Make that two copies. Why should I suffer alone? - How's this? - Isn't that overdoing it a bit, sir? Why break their hearts? All right. Let's try that one again. l think this one's sufficiently seedy, sir. There's no use overplaying it, is there, sir? [ Telephone Rings ] Yes? - Your wife is on one, sir. - What does she want? l was talking to Burrows, but I suspect it has something to do with today being the 1 5th. Payday. All right, put her on. You may connect Mrs. Sullivan. Yes? You don't happen to remember what day this is, do you, dear? Yes, I happen to remember what day it is. No, l haven't forgotten anything. Have you? Perhaps l could be a little bit more polite, Mrs. Sullivan. But somehow when I talk to you, l don't feel polite. l regret it, but that's the way it is. l don't know whether I signed it or not. l always close my eyes when I sign your check. Maybe I signed the blotter. [ Button Clicking ] Have you made out the Panther Woman's check yet? You better get it to her before she comes here with the sheriff. She has a very peculiar sense of humor. Good morning, sir. Good morning, Burrows. How do you like it? l don't like it at all, sir. Fancy dress, l take it? What's the matter with it? l have never been sympathetic to the caricaturing of the poor and needy. - Who's caricaturing? - Burrows doesn't know about the expedition, sir. I'm going out on the road to find out what it's like to be poor and needy. Then I'm going to make a picture about it. If you'll permit me to say so, the subject is not an interesting one. The poor know all about poverty. Only the morbid rich would find the topic glamorous. - But I'm doing it for the poor. - l doubt if they would appreciate it, sir. They rather resent the invasion of their privacy. l believe quite properly so. Also, such excursions can be extremely dangerous, sir. l worked for a gentleman once who likewise, with two friends. . . accoutred themselves as you have, sir, and then went out for a lark. They have not been heard from since. - That was some time ago? - 1 91 2, sir. Uh-huh. You see, sir. . . rich people and theorists─ who are usually rich people─ think of poverty in the negative, as the lack of riches. . . as disease might be called the lack of health. But it isn't, sir. Poverty is not the lack of anything. . . but a positive plague─ virulent in itself. . . contagious as cholera, with filth, criminality. . . vice and despair as only a few of its symptoms. lt is to be stayed away from even for purposes of study. lt is to be shunned. You seem to have made quite a study of it. Quite unwillingly, sir. Will that be all, sir? - Thanks. - Very good, sir. He gets a little bit gruesome every once in a while. Always reading books, sir. - Oh. - As a matter of fact, sir. . . l don't like the idea of a gentleman of your inexperience. . . leaving with only 1 0 cents in his pockets. . . so l took the extreme liberty, sir. . . of having a studio identification card. . . sewed into the sole of each of your boots. You'd think l was a child. The whole purpose of this expedition─ - [ Chattering ] - l brought Casalsis and Mr. Jones─ All right, all right. But before you all get started, I want to tell you one thing. - My mind is made up. - Nobody's here to argue with you. - You know that your slightest wish─ - We talked it all over. - There's something to the idea. - There's a great deal to it. - lt's a pip. - Stupendous. Cassy has it all worked out. It's safe as a church, big as a cathedral. Bigger! It's the story of the year. It'll make the front page of every newspaper in the country. - I'm sending five of my boys─ - With me in charge. An advance agent in front and a follow-up behind. - A cook and a still man. - l want lots of 8-by-1 0's. - Now, listen─ - I'm revamping that lovely land yacht. . . that DeMille used in Northwest Mounted. lt follows you at a discreet distance. Hot coffee, sandwiches, a little bar in back. lt's connected to the studio by shortwave. lt also carries─ - A hot shower and a secretary. - And a physician. Look, I'm trying to find trouble. . . but l won't find it with six acts of vaudeville on my tail. . . at least not the kind I'm looking for. - Be reasonable, Sully. - I'm reupholstering it from stem to stern. - Wait till you see. - l tell you I've made up my mind. - Definitely? - Definitely. - ln that case, there's nothing else to do─ - You said it. but serve you with this summons to appear and show cause. . . why you should not be restrained from jeopardizing your unique and extraordinary services. . . - by willfully, recklessly and unnecessarily— - Will you please wait a minute! We have all day, Sully. But you must realize we also have minds, also made up. Thus begins this remarkable expedition. . . - into the valley of the shadow of adversity. - The shadow of the what? The valley of the shadow of adversity. - lt's what you call a paraphrase. - Alone and unattended─ - With eight stooges. - I'll write the story, if it's just the same to you. Prey to passing prowlers, poverty and policemen─ - How poetic. - with only 1 0 cents in his pocket— l wish l had what he's got in the bank. John Lloyd Sullivan, the Caliph of Comedy— - Departed Hollywood at 4:00 this morning. - You said it. - Can l sell you another stack, Doctor? - Get me some bicarbonate of soda. - And don't call me "Doctor." - He was talking to me, l think. No, thank you. - You say you don't want no bicarbonate of soda, Doctor? - Don't call me "Doctor"! - No, l don't want any bicarbonate of soda. - l thought you say you did. Well, he don't! - This pace is very depressing. - So was the breakfast. Why doesn't he read a book if he wants to learn something? - Who, the cook? He could learn plenty. - No. Sullivan. - Maybe he don't know how to read. - The cook? No, the─ This is gonna be a great trip. Sorry. l must have the wrong number.

A whippet tank can go anywhere. Hang on!

What were you chasing, a jackrabbit? - Felt more like a kangaroo. - There he is! Well, how'd you like it? That was a dirty trick, boss. That was just a rough idea unless you play ball with me. You know l can't do what I started out to do with you guys chasing me around. . . so I'll make you a fair proposition. You go wherever you like and take it easy for a couple of weeks. I'll join you then or sooner. lf the boss wants to talk to me. . .

Everything, Doctor. It's an education. All right. I'll meet you in Las Vegas on or about the first. And thanks, kids. Thanks sincerely. [ Rooster Crows ] Yoo-hoo. - Yes, ma'am? - Don't get too tired. Yes, ma'am. First day's work. You don't suppose you're overworking him, do you? Oh, but l doubt it. He seems very strong. Did you notice his torso? - l notice that you noticed it. - Don't be vindictive, dear. Some people are just naturally more sensitive to some things in life than some people. Some are blind to beauty, while others─ Even as a little girl, you were more of the acid type, dear. While l, if you will remember— - l remember better than you do. - Well, forget it.

Don't you think with the world in its present condition... with Death snarling at you from every street corner... that people are a little allergic to comedies? - No. - Perhaps l didn't make myself clear. Say, how come you know a picture director well enough to borrow his car? Well, as a matter of fact, l used to know most of those boys... but naturally I don't like to mention it in a suit like this. As a matter of fact, l used to be a picture director. - Why, you poor kid. - Don't get emotional. I'll be all right. What kind of pictures did you make? - More along educational lines. - Oh, no wonder. There's nothing like a deep-dish movie to drive you out in the open. What are you talking about? Film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known. - You take a picture like Hold Back Tomorrow. - You hold it. - Did you ever meet Lubitsch? - Yes. Gee, I bet he wouldn't even speak to you now, huh? - He spoke to me day before yesterday. - Isn't that swell? Funny, isn't it— to meet your first picture director... on the day you're leaving Hollywood, all washed-up. Even a washed-up picture director. Don't get sympathetic. l might make a comeback, you know. That's what they all say. Man that had the room ahead of me... he was always going to make a comeback. He was a picture director too. Then one day he shot himself instead. They had to re-paper the room. You wouldn't ever do anything like that, would you, big boy? Not on your wallpaper. [ Siren Wailing ] What do you suppose that is?

Let the girl out too. She's getting bored in there. How does a girl fit in this picture? There's always a girl in the picture. Haven't you ever been to the movies? Where's he taking us now? Whose car is this? - The same guy— Sullivan. - Where's he taking us? Down to the depot to buy you a ticket and send you home. Stop fooling around. - Who's buying me a ticket? - Sullivan. - What did I ever do for him? - You bought him some eggs. Oh. So you're the washed-up director. l'm afraid l exaggerated that part of it a little bit. What are you doing in those clothes? - l just pulled that one down at the police station. - Huh? l made up a joke. Look, I'm not sore at you. I'm sore at those cops for dragging me all the way back here. No matter where l start out for, l always end up right back here in Hollywood. You're a very nice girl, as a matter of fact, and I'm glad to have met you. If there's ever anything I can do for you, I'd be delighted. Honestly. - You mean that? - Sincerely. Then buy me some ham and eggs before I bite you. Home. Where's the swimming pool? You must have a swimming pool. Right out here. Outside dining room. Barbecue. Hmm. - Pretty, isn't it? - Yeah. There's the tennis court up there. Grape arbor there and a grove there. l guess that's about all. - What are you looking at me that way for? - Oh! - Hey, you big fathead! - What's the big idea? That's for your swimming pools and your tennis courts... and your limousines and your barbecues. That's for making fun of a poor girl who only tried to help you. - You big faker. - Who made fun of you? You did, with your stories of being a washed-up director, you big clunk. - Oh, I did, did l? - [ Screaming ] [ Laughing ] Breakfast is served, sir. - You might have shaved. - l need these whiskers for my experiment. - Oh, yes, the noble experiment. - You don't have to make any cracks. l don't suffer and starve because l like it, you know.

As a matter of fact, l had kind of a yen for you. - You have? - Not in that thing. l liked you better as a tramp. [ Sullivan ] l can't help what kind of people you like. It's funny. l suppose l ought to be very happy for you... as if you'd just struck oil or something. - Instead of that, I'm sore. - Don't frown. You're making lines in your face. You've taken all the joy out of life. l was all through with this kind of stuff. l knew I'd never have it, but there was no envy in my heart. I'd found a friend who'd swiped a car to take me home. Now I'm right back where l started─ just an extra girl having breakfast with a director. Only I didn't use to have breakfast with them. - Maybe that was my trouble. - Did they ever ask you to? - No. - Then don't pat yourself on the back. - Take me with you. - What? On your experiment. l don't want to be sent home. Don't be childish. I'll tell you what I'll do. You can stay here for a couple weeks like I told you. When l get back, I'll see what I can do for you. l don't want to start all that stuff again. Take me with you. When you get as far as you're going, we can say good-bye. I'll go the rest of the way alone. It'll make a nice ending, and we'll finish what we started this morning. That's absolutely out of the question. Please. You don't know anything about anything. You don't know how to get a meal, how to keep a secret. - You can't even stay out of town. - Thanks. l know 50 times as much about trouble as you ever will. Besides, you owe it to me. You sort of belong to me. When you were a hobo, I found you. - Piffle. - Please. - It's absolutely out of the question. - I'll throw you in the water. You'd take my mind off my work. [ Laughs ] The big director that has all the girls panting for him. - l tell you─ - I'll follow you. I'll tell everybody who you are, like a kid sister. You'll follow me? Yes, I'll follow you, and I'll holler, "This guy's a phony, ladies and gentlemen. This is Sullivan, the big director from Hollywood. A Phonus balonus, a faker, a heel"— lf l may join in the controversy, sir... l think the young lady's suggestion an excellent one. - You may not join in the controversy. - l will, l will, l will! - I'm going with you! - You'll do nothing of the kind. Would you get me some tramp clothes, Mr. Burrows? - Certainly, miss. Certainly. - Go down to the station and get me a ticket to─ - Where do you live? - I won't tell you. l won't be sent home on the rattler. You stop that! Now stop that! Grab her feet! Oh! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. - Now, miss─ Now, miss─ Stop it, please, miss! - l won't be sent home! - Let go of me! - Oh, my! Oh! Mr. Burrows. This way, Mr. Burrows. There we are. Now─ Now one, two, three. Pull hard! Hello, Information? Have you any freight trains going east this afternoon or early this evening? 5:48. Thank you very much indeed, sir. Oh, and could you tell me, does that train carry tramps? And if so, where do they get on? What? lt's on page two. - What did you say? - Tramps. How would you like to take a flying─ Wise guy. Yes, sir? What was that again? l said l wonder if you'd be kind enough to settle a bet for us. Just a few of us here at the club. lf a tramp were to board your 5:48 this afternoon... from where would he board it? l see. l see, yes. But not within the yard limits. l think that gives me the complete picture. Thank you very much for your trouble. Oh, and by the way, I win. [ Laughs ] Good day. A different approach to the same problem. [ Steam Hissing ] [ Bell Clanging ] [ Train Whistle Blows ] l think this is it, sir. - [ Clanging Continues ] - [ Train Whistle Blows ] Why don't you go back with the car? You look about as much like a boy as Mae West. All right, they'll think I'm your frail. l believe it's called a beazle, miss, if memory serves. - Good-bye, Burrows. See you in a couple of weeks. - Good-bye, sir. May l close, sir, by warning you against the entire expedition... which l envision with deep apprehension... and gloomy foreboding. Thanks. Same to you. Come on. - [ Bell Clanging ] - [ Train Engine Chugging ] [ Train Whistle Blowing ] - [ Bell Clanging ] - [ Whistle Blows ] [ Chattering, Shouting ] [ Man ] Don't let it run over ya! - Jump! - [ Grunts ] [ Girl ] Come on. Here. I'll help you. - Let me up! - I've got you! - We made it! - Yeah. Amateurs. Whew! Oh. How do you do? - Beautiful weather. - lf it doesn't rain. How do you feel about the labor situation? Where are you going? l hope we didn't disturb you. - Very interesting couple. - Yeah. [ Sniffing ] - Do you smell anything? - l certainly do. - What does it smell like to you? - Hogs. - That's what I was afraid of. - I'm getting hungry. How can you possibly be hungry when you just ate? I'm not a scientist. All l know is I'm hungry. [ Sneezes ] You'd better tell the porter to close the window. l didn't ask you to come along in the first place. Now that you're─ [ Sneezes ] [ Stuffed Nose ] Don't start "baking" wisecracks. - "Dough," sir. - Blasted draft in here at that. - Where is this train going? - l don't know. - How long does it take to get there? - l didn't ask you to come along. l think that's a perfectly reasonable question. Haven't you got enough imagination to pretend we're broke... hungry, homeless, drifting in despair? Let's just sit here and try to feel like a couple of tramps. - Cold? - I'll be all right. - lt's the desert. - [ Yawning ] I'll be all right. As soon as this blasted thing comes to a town someplace... I'll send for a car and have you taken home. This is a lot of hokey-palokey. This is a terrible way to travel, with a girl. lt's better with a girl than without one. You would have frozen to death. lf l go back, will you go back with me? - Nonsense! - Then I won't go back either. You're so simple you're apt to get into a lot of trouble. What do you think I'm out here for? Gee, l like that about you. You're like those knights of old... who used to ride around looking for trouble. - Who was it that rode on a pure white horse? - Lady Godiba. She must have been a nut. l bet her husband was sore. Are you jealous? Why don't you shut up and try to get some sleep? - Will you go to sleep too? - I'll try. Why don't you try counting the hogs jumping over a hedge? Listen, short britches─ [ Sniffles ] [ Sullivan Groans ] [ Whistle Blowing ] - [ Sneezes ] - What's that? - Nothing. Just me. - What? - l sneezed. - You what? l─ [ Sneezes ] - l sneezed. - Oh, you poor darling. - Have you got hay fever? - l think it's hog fever. [ Coughing ] Oh, you poor lamb. I'll be all right as soon as the sun gets a little warber. Are you huggry? [ Giggles ] You got me doing it. - Have we got any eating money? - Ten cents. Can we spend it for breakfast, or are you saving it for something? I've already told you. I'll send for a car for you─ l can't help it if I'm good-natured. l like to be with you, and it puts me in a good humor. You take lots of girls and made them sleep in a hog sty all night... then didn't tell them where their breakfast was coming from the next morning... they wouldn't take it lying down. We'll find some breakfast somewhere. - ln some swill pail, l suppose. - What do the other bums do? They steal chiggins─ chickens. And they roast them over campfires... with baked potatoes and green corn on the cob... - with melted butter─ - Shut ub! - Where do they get butter? - They steal it. Well, they don't. lt isn't as easy as all that. There's a lot of suffering in this world... that ordinary people don't know anything about. - [ Sniffles ] - Now what's the matter? - I'm hungry. - Well─ [ Sneezes ] [ Train Whistle Blowing ] There's a town up ahead. Let's get off and see what happens. - What town is it? - l don't know. l suppose it's Hollywood. Look. There's a lunch stand. Come on. Well, come on. l can't keep running along here all day. Here l come. Just a minute. Well, come on. Did I hurt you any? Well, you didn't do me any good. [ Gasping ] Come on. [ Sneezes ] [ Horn Honks ] [ Train Whistle Blowing ] Cup of coffee and sinker for one. l never eat till noon. lt gives me indigestion. - Just make that two coffees. - That'll be 1 0 cents. That's all right. It's right here someplace. - Holy Moses. - What's the matter? l must have spent it in that owl wagon. - I'll never get rich. - Oh, gee. You're a little richer than you were. Hundreds of miles from everything, cut off from the world... a taste of human kindness. I'll never forget it as long as l live. What town is this? - Las Vegas, Nevada. - Las Vegas, Nevada, and this is the Busy Bee. Las Vegas? You mean Las Vegas? - What about it? - ls there a land yacht waiting here? Land yacht? You mean that thing? That's perfectly wonderful, Mr. Sullivan. l rejoice in your experience. And where does this gentleman live? Just up there by the tracks. Give him a hundred dollars, never mind who from. - That's swell. - A great human-interest story. It'll probably ruin him. He'll give turkey dinners to every slug that comes in and never hit the jackpot again. All right, all right. Buy the kid here a few clothes... and meet me in Kansas City— someplace near the station. l'm going the hard way. So long, gang. - Oh─ - Just a minute, please. Sit down. But listen, Doc— You listen! lt's three days in bed minimum. This is just a cold shot. You won't even feel it. [ Shouts ] - l haven't time to spend three days in bed! - You'll take the time. You'll get to Kansas City just as soon... and you can imagine that you went there on your cow-snatcher... - or whatever you use. - [ Gasping ] - What have you got an imagination─ - [ Sneezes ] - Here's something for you. - What's that? It's Christmas. So long! [ Knocking ] - Come in. - Here's a wrapper for you and some slippers. - What? - A wrapper. Oh. Thanks. There's some makeup in the medicine cabinet. - Oh, thanks. l can use it. - You sure can. Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand. He's right here in the next room taking a little snooze. He looks great. This whole thing is doing him a power of good. [ Coughing ] [ Spritzing ] [ Sniffs ] [ Spritzing ] [ Knocking ] Come in. - Hello. Feel better? - No. I'm sore. There's nothing the matter with me but a little fever. Even if I did get sick, they could've sent me to some free hospital or something. Wherever they send you. lt would have been very interesting. They give you a nice free burial, too, in Potter's Field. Free burial? Why does everybody exaggerate everything so much? I've got a little cold in my head. You take a dose of salts, there you are. - It's because you're a very valuable man. - Bushwa. - You make very lovely pictures. - Phooey. - Well, you do. - It's a funny thing... how everything keeps shoving me back to Hollywood or Beverly Hills─ [ Coughs ] or this monstrosity we're riding in. Almost like─ like gravity... as if some force were saying, "Get back where you belong. You don't belong out here in real life, you phony, you." You're a little feverish. Maybe there's a universal law that says, "Stay put. As you are, so shall you remain." Maybe that's why tramps are always in trouble. They don't vote. They don't pay taxes. They violate the law of nature. You look very pretty in that outfit. Maybe that's why they don't want trailer colonies. Or am I getting a bit profound? You're getting a bit hot. Your hand is very cool. But nothing is going to stop me. I'm going to find out how it feels to be in trouble... without friends, without credit... without checkbook, without name. - Alone. - And I'll go with you. How can l be alone if you're with me? [ No Audible Dialogue ] ♪♪ [ Hymn ] [ No Audible Laughter ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ No Audio ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand.

He's all washed up, except tonight he's just going through for a quick tour. He's taking a thousand dollars in five-dollar bills... and he's going to hand them out to these tramps... in gratitude for what they done for him. Now, is that a story? Does that give you a lump in your throat... or does that give you a lump in your throat? [ Snoring ] [ Snorts ] - [ Sighs ] Hello. - Hello. Tired? No, no. l was just... thinking. Well, here we are at the end of the adventure. I'll go down tonight and give them a little money, and that winds it up. Now what do you want to do? Do you want to go home, or do you want to take another crack at Hollywood? - Well, l'd─ - With a nice, fat letter to Lubitsch. I'd sort of like to go where you go. l mean, I'd sort of hoped that you'd─ Well, I mean, that you'd want us to go on together a little longer... now that we kind of got used to each other. Of course I would, if I wasn't married. - Who's married? - Well, didn't you know that? - l thought everyone had heard of my misfortune. - Of course I didn't. What do you mean, "Of course I didn't," as if I'd snatched you away... - from your loving grandmother or something? - Are you in love with her? - That vulture? - Then why did you marry her? - Income tax. - Income tax? lt was supposed to save me $24,000 a year. It's what's called a joint return. lt's a California law. Each one pays half, and the total's less than the aggregate surtax... or the surtax is less than the something or other. lt was an idea of my business manager's. - Well, l think it's disgusting. - lt wasn't supposed to be romantic. lt was supposed to save me $1 2,000 a year. - [ Scoffs ] - But it didn't. - Turned out she couldn't live on 1 2,000 a year. - Good. - Lovely. She had to have 24,000 to live on. - Good. Don't keep saying "good" all the time, or I'll poke you in the nose. - Good. - Now listen. So l demanded the divorce she'd promised me. And she told you to go fry an egg. She said it would break her mother's heart. Some fine advice your business manager gave you. Yeah, I found out why. He was getting half. And you really can't get a divorce ever? Never. You can't get a divorce without collusion, and she won't collude. Well, l guess l ought to go home then. You could still have that letter to Lubitsch. Could I still come and push you in the pool sometimes? - Of course you could. - [ Sniffles ] l guess that's better than nothing. There, there, there. My gracious. Here are the five-dollar bills, Mr. Sullivan. Hello, Johnnie. - And get me two tickets on the midnight plane. - Two tickets? [ Chuckling ] Oh, two tickets. Oh, yes indeed, Mr. Sullivan. - They're pretty, aren't they? - Uh-huh. - You want one? - Yes. Here. You can have two of them.

Sure. l guess that's all you can do. - Anyway, he didn't have an accident. - [ Phone Rings ] Hello? He isn't, huh? Val has covered the police stations. - Okay. - l guess you can come back now. So long. l should have gone with him. l knew he'd get into trouble without me. - l told him─ - I'm gonna give him just 1 2 minutes more. Then I'm gonna lay it in LeBrand's lap and let him figure it out. Sully will be awful sore if you raise a big holler— Let him be sore! l got a job too, you know. - lf LeBrand ever found out— - He came back the last time. He didn't have reservations on the plane or people waiting for him. - You don't know him like I know him. - ls that so? - l guess l know him better than─ - [ Rings ] Yeah? Say, I'm down here to the morgue. They got a guy in a basket. You can't tell who he is. Did the boss have any ident-identification? Did he have any identification that you know of?

What identification did he have? ln the soles of his shoes. l think there was a─ a card between the soles of his shoes. Look in the soles of his shoes, between the leather.
