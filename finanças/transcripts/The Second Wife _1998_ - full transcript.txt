I bet you'd love to be in the bride's place tonight, huh? No, I didn't even like it the first time! Long live the happy couple! We always said Fosco had women in Sicily, too We thought she was one of the many He married her, though I'm so glad Handsome! I got lipstick on you He must be in love Why else would be have married a single mother? Eliana, you lost out At least the little girl will have a real family now She'll be fine with Fosco Some women settle for such misfits just to get married He made a pretty good choice He sure did He wore the first one out, but this time it'll be him No, he'll make it I'll take care of it Santina, if you're staying at Aunt Fernanda's for a week We'll have to get to know each other She said she's going to be good, right? Where I live there's a puppy bunny rabbits And Uncle Moreno will imitate all kinds of animals for you Moreno, do a turtle for her Fernanda, you're going to have to play Mommy this time I don't mind I would've had ten kids if I had my way He's the one who can't do the job My darling little plucked chicken! He has other good points, though Fosco, are we going to take this picture? She certainly is pretty But she's annoying when she talks like all Sicilians are She doesn't have to stump anybody when she's in bed Focus in on them good Now a picture with Livio. Come here Come on, move it Let's play the happy family Why are you wearing those glasses? The sun Bothers me You look blind You see, Anna, he's not happy if he isn't original Come on, a group picture Make sure they're good, Sirio or I'm not paying Get down, ladies That's it, good. Like a soccer team Look how cute. It looks like they're taking a whiz We'll be in Florence by 10:00 Then tomorrow morning we'll take the train and off to Paris! With my darling in Paris! Fosco! Who's that pain in the neck? What is it? Come down Now? We're about to leave J ust come take a look, then leave Coming Ten, twenty minutes and I'll be back Wait for me I'll tell you everything later I'm stupider than you are We worked on it two nights At least get some satisfaction I'll go get the car No, sit on the bar I'll play the girlfriend Hang on Go slow Watch the holes. You'll clobber my balls Not to worry, I'll lend you mine That way I'll get to try out your new bride You haven't any left? No, he got called away They're waiting for me I have to get changed Go on, don't worry What do you want us to bring you from Paris? Brigitte Bardot Red Well? Well, my ass. It's empty! We even left the reception early! To hell with you and your graves! I'm coming down We got the raw deal again this time, too! Damn it all! Watch it, you'll ruin your suit Hold on Come on, baby Dad! What did you find? Quiet! Put that light out What do they want? The carabinieri! Carabinieri! Come on out! We're done for if they catch us Run, Duilio! They knew There were waiting! I'll never make it! I've always said the old should stay home Got'em Both of them We're going to end up staying here all night What are you laughing about? Where did you book? At the Excelsior? What a honeymoon! You mean a "crappymoon"! Me and these four idiots up to our knees in water Wake up Come on, wake up What time is it? It's late I don't know, but it's late I'm sorry I got held up We'll leave in the morning What are you doing? What am I doing? Why don't we play doctor? What do you say? What do you think I'll do? I'll undress you I'll do it Why? I like undressing you What have you been up to? Up to? Nothing Stay still. Be good Where are they? Here they are I don't like these. They're too ladylike Put them down We'll buy some nicer things in Paris No, wait I'm all sweaty Look at the state I'm in Plus I like it... - a little smell Sweetheart Giuliano, did you get picked for Double or nothing? Not yet, but I'm learning! I'm up to Count Ugolino! He lifted his mouth from his proud plate... - Last one in is a foggot! That doesn't count! Let's go eat Livio, Stella left you another love letter I'll read it Come on, Trepeli Here we go. "My darling I saw you last night at the rec room" She spelled it with a "K" What a jackass You were gorgeous I'd take her for a spin if I were you Come on, get on. She's a little thick but... - Put some corks in her mouth At least she won't talk So upon reaching his father's house Cronus, overcome with rage took the dagger and castrated him Then he hurted the male attribute into the sea Which immediately became covered in form This is how Aphrodite, the most beautiful of all women, was born Or Venus, which is the same thing See? Even in mythology, like in the Bible You women are always born from a little piece of us men You know, Gedeone, without that thing you can't do a thing! We always have to hear these ancient stories Tell us about a movie A nice love story with feeling With him, her, and the other, the one who comes back We women like to suffer a little We like to cry There's a customer at the gas pump I'm coming! Kids, enough of that chalk! With the national bike race on they're always in the way Santina, why don't you go play with the kids? Men and Women are allowed to mingle around here We're not in the south anymore She's just joking. Don't mind her Look at that beauty. It'd take Fosco's aim to move it He's got other things on his mind I bet he's going all out in Paris I bet he goes on duty at night and stops in the morning With a woman like that, just imagine the sweat Fosco is working up Not a chance. He'll even do overtime in the afternoon! You'd think he'd get a bonus I think life starts on some star up there in the sky Awesome. All those dinosaurs in line humping with a schlong like this Is that all you think about? Are we going to play? Wake up, Livio. Come on Remember when he locked himself in the hotel with that blonde from Pordenone? He went to the front desk when he got downstairs and said Take an ice pack up to the missus! He wore her right out! The poor thing was bowlegged for three days Wait, Santina, don't run! Mommy! Mommy's little angel I missed you so much Let me see how pretty you've gotten Now that Mommy's back, you don't even look at me You're choking me. I can't breathe Your poor aunt. Bad girl You're still sucking your thumb? The other hand's on the boobs She tried that on me, too but there's no satisfaction in my boobs you know How was she? A darling We always slept in the same bed didn't we? It was like having a doll It's so hot It's been two or three days now that this heat broke out It takes your breath away Take off your stockings How can you wear those stocking? This is for you Thank you It's too much Fosco picked it It looks terribly expensive What a silly man Tell me something How did it go with Fosco? Fine What about his personality? There are still some things I don't understand him He's weird, just like all men He's got a certain flair I just know he'll make you happy won't he? We're back. At least come and say hello I didn't hear you When are you going to cut this girly hair? Here A little gift from Paris I'm convinced women like it just as much as we men do No, but nature, women get into it more If you promise a woman not to tell anyone... - On the average, how long do you think a man can... - with a woman? It depends Twenty, thirty minutes. It depends With a woman like that, even an hour and a half Out of 20 minutes, you'd have 18 left over Livio! Here comes Gea Your father wants you! The demijohns have to be filled up At your age, I always hung around older guys You're always with younger guys though It must mean something Pass 'em here Anna, tell us about Paris. I beg you had such a good time Did Fosco show you around the Eiffel Tower? Or did you stay locked up in the hotel all day? Matella, what kind of question is that? We came up for air every once in a while Did you go to any nightclubs? Yes, we even went to see striptease The whole works? Yup Paris Men dressed up like women? Coccunelle! No They say it's a man, but it's all for show She's all woman to the bone He's got a pecker. It might only be this little but it's still there Nature's phenomena It's the spice of life Did you think it works? It must do something At least a good ticket J ust right to start with for you There are kids here! We're taking a trip next year to Paris with our priest It's time for a smoke now Then we'll take them down and start over again Why? Why? Because you did it wrong Me? Which did you pass me when I told you to pass me the demijohns? The ones that were here You got it wrong. You should've passed me the big ones first then the little ones I know you. You didn't want to start with the heavy ones so you passed me the small ones You see now? They don't fit What? They've got to be taken down Do you need a hand? It takes brains even to load up a truck Why didn't you tell me before? Because you have to learn! Wouldn't I have learned just the same if you told me? You have to run into things to get them right We've only played around so far Let's try to get it right now I don't want some guy like your dead-weight uncle in my house Your mother was enough for me Hand them to me! Take it easy. You'll break it It's oil. It's bad luck You want me to kill myself in the truck? You could have told him the same thing with more respect He's used to it. He doesn't even notice He must learn to defend himself That's not easy with you I can't do this hand You cut them for me You humiliated him in front of all those women Livio is a sensitive boy Are you his lawyer, his mother, what? You already have a daughter Isn't that enough? You're mad Look at my Sicilian. J ust arrived and already criticizing Poor Fosco I'll end up having a butch for a wife What's a butch? A woman who busts a man's balls 'cause she has more than he does You're right Come here! My pretty darling! You want to feel another sensitive guy? Knock it off, Fosco! I'm away for three days You're in for it tonight Sensitive Bye, sweetheart! Watch out, don't let the Sicilian take the chair out from under you What's yours, stays yours Oh, Sicilian, insolent, voluptuos matron... - What does he do? Act! ...- at the breezy windows of the seaside village You're spitting all over yourself like a baby You're supposed to take your nerve medicine before you eat Classical Mediterranean Woman of the Sea Has marriage done your dad good? Sort of I get it. He still gets on your back No, I've learned how to defend myself That's not enough What do I do, kill him? It's not easy with Fosco It was covered with dirt It doesn't matter There's darkness and silence in the body Santina and I waited for you to eat I ate at my uncle's house Maybe if you had told me... - I'm sorry I'm going to my room They're up to no good If someone shows you disrespect just tell Fosco, and he'll take care of it Santina, a storm is brewing! Look at those billows! See how the ship sways? Help! A waterspout! Watch out, Pluto! He fell overboard, poor Pluto We'll never see him again I'll throw a rope down for him Why aren't you in your room? Livio is reading me Mickey Mouse It's time for bed Go on, Santina. No, finish first Come here with us J ust for a minute Holy mackerel. What's going on Captain? We're in the Sea of Ghosts Here comes the flying Dutchman's ship See all those torn sails? Look how the helm is spinning around I like having a big brother like Livio Look how Pluto is staring at that mean crocodile What's he going to do to Pluto rip off his tail or his arm? It's Fosco He said he'd be back tonight He's got a young wife, you know It seems to me you've put a spell on him Look at this dust! Howdy, girls. It's Wanda at your service You look like a gypsy I even put some lace underwear on I can't show you them, though You'd be shocked I wouldn't! I never say no when there's something big to see You see her? That's Antonella She sings in the choir with Livio. I think they like each other She looks like a nice girl Yes But her father is a real piece of shit When I was a partisan struggling to drive out the Fascists and Germans he was running the black market ripping people of I wouldn't want to end up with that asshole as a father-in-law Piece of shit Beautiful lady I like this song It give me the blues 2:00 No, 3:00 Okay, sulky There, 3:00 Let's go outside for a while Do you read these stories often? Every once in a while Do you like them? Yes, they're amusing They're kind of ridiculous, though Yes, you're right. They're a bit idle In real life people probably don't have time for all these complicated love stories But like them because they're romantic But love isn't complicated in Romanticism It's pain Pain? Pain is what puts feelings on a pedestal and turns them into poetry It's internal pain Pain is in the soul That means Romanticism is even more exaggerated than picture stories! Go on, get down Tell me something Is there ever real love in picture stories or Romanticism? Is there ever a man who says to a woman, "Eat me?" Eat me? Eat me Santina, I said "eat" It's what you do with food Come, let me spin you around Livio used to cry when I did it to him He was scared I'd drop him Come on, get dressed We're off to the races Are you coming with us? No, I'll watch them from uncle's terrace I see He's going to watch them from above The Miss is here Look how he parades her around Your dad wants everyone to envy him He had her dress like that so all his friends can see That's the kind of bullshit kids or older farts do Livio! Come on down! Moroccan! I'm going down with them Go on All right, then I'm going to stand here and gossip a little too Goodness, what roses Pretty, hun? She walks too straight, though She's the kind that doesn't move her ass Neck yes, ass no It's an art You don't learn those things I'd give her the once-over if I were a man Look at that stack Fosco outdid himself but underneath it all, she's just a little girl Looking for love like all of us Ready? Go! Give it to me, Fosco! Give it to me! Quiet, guys Let me see it What a beauty! Guys, there's even gold! Look, he's singing a lullaby "Off to sleep you go my little chickades" This is worth a few million We'll only sell it good abroad I have to go to Milan on Thursday I'll give the Swiss guy a call What does the Swiss man say? Guten Tag That queer always said, "Call me if you find any human or animal figures I pay more than everybody." A new TV and fridge is a drop in the bucket with this You can even buy a new wife! I have to think about a college for my son He's only ten years old! I plan ahead Money is what you need to survive It takes more than that to live You think like a rich man You're just jealous Remember when we came here As partisans They're taking the piss out of me The kids want to see the gold statues Who told her? I don't know Maybe she overheard me talking to Fernanda Good job. Well done, really Couldn't you have kept quiet? We weren't talking loud So I see I thought you were taught to be quiet in the south Everybody knows about it anyway Speak up Everybody knows you found something valuable Why don't we go to the radio, then television put it in the paper? What are you afraid of? Robbing graves is like a second job around here Lots of you do it. It's a conspiracy of silence You don't approve, do you? I just think it's odd Why? You, Duilio, and Cicala raised such a stink as partisans, and then... - Stink? What do you mean? All those sacrifices, ideals We did our part! We did what we had to do! We had to drive the enemy out and we did! We risked our lives for your sake, too! Got it? To give you a better life! Who said you didn't? Who's doubting it? You've been saying the same thing for ages! I even know it by heart Then what's so odd about it? Let's hear it. Speak up Let's hear your squeaky little voice All your principles, lectures Then you go sell what's everyone's to the first asshole who pays for it He might even be an enemy who shot at you! It's odd. Admit it You're right We're a bunch of jerks Me, Duilio, Cicala We're plain pitiful We thought we did something good but instead we're traitors I needed someone like you to open my eyes Our little teacher has taught us a good lesson Can we change the subject? Santina, give me a tug on the ear The teacher said I'm bad Tug hard! Harder! It's useless If you don't like something you act like an ass Ass? Don't you dare call me that I just might forget you're a boy and punch your face in Got it? You stupid little puissant He's read three books and now he thinks he can judge the world the idiot Take him something to eat Go Here, eat something You catch the fireflies we'll put them under here And tomorrow morning there'll be money instead of fireflies That means I can get a perm A perm! At six years old? You're on the right track Are you coming to catch fireflies with us? Go on, run along Careful, don't go in the road! Look at the fireflies this year Yes, they're all over What's wrong? Nothing I don't feel like traveling anymore After all, I've found the one who's going to tame me Firefly, firefly, come over here The king says, "Have no fear" "Fear not" say the king and queen I haven't figured you out yet I'm peeling all over with this sun Don't change the subject You like it, you don't like it... - Sometimes you intimidate me Really? It doesn't seem that way to me Take him with you Who? Livio Talk to him Be a father I wanted to get up to no good, but no you have to go and get serious Promise? There's no way I can this time Last one out pays for drinks! I dreamt I became a priest last night They wanted to send me to a seminary to study. Yeah, right here Instead of the church benches there were mattresses with women on top and they all had a towel over their face Like this, look They were all saying, "Come, come!" Look, I'm getting hard I didn't know which to pick, so in the end I picked any old one I took the tower off her face and you know who it was? Brigitte Bardot! It was my sister! It was too late by then though If I had a sister like yours, I'd go for it in a minute Nothing compares to a lay with your sister in the hays! I'd even go for an aunt, a niece a grandmother! You don't have those problems, do you? With a girl like Anna at home You can tell us We won't tell anybody We understand you It's Stella! Take a good look, Stella! What are you doing up there? You want to come up? I can't When there's nothing under my feet... - I always have to have my feet on the ground It was so hot today At least you can breathe up here Did you read about Venice? Fifteen people died This is the kind of summer you remember when you're old Remember how hot it was in the summer of '57? It'll end, it'll end Darn mosquitoes How do you... - see me? What do you mean? As a relative or a friend? As Fosco's son I know that But if you had to make a comparison... - I don't know a brother? I haven't talked to my brother in ages A cousin Yes My cousin Antonio What's he like? Older He used to stop and visit once in a while on Sunday He was so gorgeous He didn't even notice me I always wrote about him in my school compositions All my classmates used to tease me Then he moved to Australia Who knows what he's like now? I get it You were slightly in love What? In love? Good night, Tarzan. In love! I'll drown you! Sorry! You want a war? I still have some water I'll throw it at you Sorry, I didn't mean to! Stop it, Livio! Let's go, Arduina We'll catch pneumonia Help! It's check up time! Come on, girls let's give Livio a checkup! He'll show us his pecker He'll show us all! You'll hurt him Stop! I give in! Come here, it's time for a nap Come here, you bullfighter Let's go, my little bullfighter I'm going to get you! Careful. You'll knock them over I'm marrying Livio when I grow up You're going to marry him? When you're grown up Livio will be an old man Fosco is old, too but you still married him He's your brother! No, because you're not Livio's mother and I'm not Fosco's daughter You still can't marry him, though I'm going to run away with Livio when I'm grown up and make him kidnap me You're going to be kidnapped? Listen to her! Fosco's been arrested Don't worry, you'll see Fosco will be home tomorrow You'll see Who said I found it in a grave? It's been at home for ages Who brought it? Our grandpa, our great-great grandpa I don't know Who says he didn't? I'll fool them. I'll just say I thought it was an old crock I only had it with me to prop up the demijohns Sit down This guy is really on my back I've got the perfect excuse They won't keep me in here long How are you doing? How do you think I'm doing? Fine I'm clean. How can they say I traffic in works of art? They don't have any proof. Three, four days and I'll be home Don't worry, I'll fool them I'd talk to a lawyer When the time comes, if I need to... - Maybe I could talk to Uncle Umberto There's a good one Well? Yes, sit down Maybe just for some advice I said no! Say it again and I'll really get pissed! Don't worry, honey Do I go for the big point? Let's hope so. Try I say you can't do it Not this time When you're done playing we'd like to talk to you That is, if we're not disturbing I think about him all the time I can't even sleep at night Nobody can sleep in this heat Then you tell us what we're supposed to do Go bug some big-shot politician in the party! We can't involve people from the party for something like this They wanted to give him a gold medal before He just needs some help now Give me a drag You're making me start smoking again The party can't go out on a limb We'll all get a bad rap Sure, it's doing Fosco a lot of good to be in jail Let's go Here, you smoke it I haven't smoked in two years The marshal She's asking us. We're just a bother Who's going to listen to us? What happened? Nothing I did it myself, like an idiot I was mending a sock and... - I hit myself right in the eye I could've come up with a better one Have a seat I got in an argument and hit a guard I just can't bite my tongues Tell me about you How are you? Isn't there a doctor here? Did you have it looked at? Let's get things straight! If you have to play the pain-stricken Sicilian lady, stay home I won't put up with it I want you to give me some happiness Like you give me cigarettes, like you give me chocolate I want you to give me a smile Come dressed nice. At least at night I'll dream of you and get off on it What's that face for? You come here with a long face and leave the same way Thank goodness I'm not dead yet I don't want to die A man who can break me has yet to be born There you go Start crying now That'll make things better Are you coming dancing with us? It's Livio's birthday today No, honey, you go Aren't you even going to ask me how your father is How nice of you How's my brother doing? What did he tell you? Did you have to have a party while Fosco is in jail? Yes, our boy is having a birthday And I care about my nephews We're not cry-babies around here You either sink or swim! Sicilians! You wanted her, now you've got her Excuse me I wanted to say... - Don't worry, we'll clean everything up when we're done Go on, go I have to get changed Wait, I'll help you We didn't make too much noise I came by to wish you happy birthday Close your fly in the front I never sleep. I just can't I get so restless in bed You know what I'm gonna do? I'll go to the cemetery and take some flowers to your poor mother I locked Renata out in the terrace! I'm leaving her there all night! He's just kidding Sometimes the things he says just don't make sense He keeps insisting he was the one who sent Fosco to jail He says he called the IRS He says he did it for you Can you imagine if he tells the Sicilian or Fernanda that? What did Red want? He came to say they found someone who's going to help Fosco Someone important He'll be back soon, you'll see Good At least I had some breathing room What? Red isn't someone with a lot of scruples After Fosco, he's the biggest Don J uan around What are you saying? I just said it so you'd know Here. No, I want it off like this! It has to come off this way! Stop it! Aren't you ashamed? It didn't last as long as it usual does this time Unfortunately that's the way this disease is One relapse, then another, and it's off to the insane asylum The same thing happened to his grandfather. Remember? When there's insanity in your blood that's the way it is It's almost 2:00 Why don't you go to bed? It's useless I just pretend to be like everybody else Fosco is right We're just alike What are you saying? What's gotten into you? I'm scared Hold me, please I always get stuck with the dirty work You're used to it They're queens and I'm the mule Gedeone, can't you hear somebody's coming? Here I come We put enough salt in, don't you think? It'll be too salty if we add any more right? Anna, I don't think there are enough bottles Will you go get some clean ones in the kitchen? Santina, come fill the bottles up I'll show you how Climb up here Be careful with her What are you doing? There's something in my eye I'll take care of it Let me see All gone What's wrong? I think I have a fever Well, what about the bottles? What do you want? Nothing There was a ladybug in your hair It's good luck Let me by At least let's talk about it What's there to talk about? Nothing happened I have other things on my mind You're driving the three-wheeler this morning? Yes, and I want to learn how to drive the truck, too That's the spirit You women can't just sit around doing needlework and petting yourselves I'm coming to pick you up later tonight Later and later! I think you're cheating on me! Get up and get out of here You have to leave me alone Don't try anything on me again I fell asleep You can't harass me like this You have to leave me alone I didn't realize Don't ever do it again Livio said he's taking us to the movies tonight No, we can't go tonight Take her, go on At least you'll have some fun She's right Livio, talk her into it It's not easy If your mom doesn't want to... - You know what we'll do? We'll be quiet as mice And then we'll try asking her later I said no. When I say no, it's no! Come here, now! Look what a mess. You're all sweaty You lost out this time You meanie! I want to sleep at your house tonight Okay, but don't cry And apologize to your mom Don't ever turn Santina against me again Don't even try it. Look at me! You're going to Fernanda's tomorrow You can't come here until your father's back Either you go alone, or I'll drag you there by the hair You can't stay here anymore That means you're in love, too That doesn't count. Take it easy! Mind the rules. I'm a flyweight You mean a weenie weight Here comes the scooters! Get out of here with that junk And you said you souped up the carburettor It's not the scooter, it's the driver It was his fault. He cut me of twice I won The drinks are on me Where? The rec room is closed at this hour What are you doing? You guys stink! How much do you bet I can do 50 of these? Eleven, twelve thirteen, fourteen fifteen Come here, Moroccan Go call Stella! Come join us Come on! Don't! Livio's there Are you still remembering? What are you remembering? A ship is on its way loaded with... - No, Stella, no Go away Take it easy. Don't be scared Don't worry, I'm leaving right now Immediately Wait Come here Let me take a look Stop it What did you do to yourself? I'll get a few things and leave I'm going to Renata's because that's where I belong We've got the same brain My uncle and I are just alike We're both the same... we're crazy We've got the same screwed-up brain I'll get changed and leave I'm leaving right now What am I supposed to do now? I'm calling Fernanda Call her! Who cares? Call whoever you want Tell me what I'm supposed to do I have nothing else to lose Leave it alone I'll do it Let me have a look I didn't come looking for you You're the one who came here What am I supposed to do? Look what you did to yourself I love you What can I do if I love you? I don't want to hear it I can't do it I'm hurting I don't care Please Be quiet Once... - just once and that's it Then I'll leave I'll go away and never come back You won't see me again Just once Let me... - catch my breath Then I'll leave I'll leave At least one of us will have some peace and quiet I give up I'll leave you alone Even if you go, what difference will it make? We're in the same boat for once It's useless to fight it Follow me, ma'am Come on, little guys Help me impress her I picked them in the courtyard They grow on the walls I saw them and... - You kind of go back to being young in here What's wrong? If you feel like crying, cry I won't get mad, I promise Outsides it's... - It's August J ust yesterday I was thinking About when Livio was born and as usual I wasn't there It's the first time I thought about it It must mean I miss him I miss you all, but Livio... I must say I miss him I guess I've got the blues How do I look gray? I'm more interesting Right? Got you! Sorry about that Pay up What are you doing here? She didn't see anything I checked to make sure. I closed myself in the closet and all you can see through the keyhole are legs Thank goodness She saw us She's nuts, though Even if she tells somebody who'd believe her? What now? What do we do? What do we do? We'll become invisible We'll go back to being kids together We'll be born ten years later That's better We'll stop the whole world and it'll just be you and me all alone We could even die together if you want What wind! Goodness gracious! I'm flying! It'd be a miracle if you could fly! A little fresh air will do your beavers good It'll get the cobwebs out! Wind, wind Take me away with you We'll go to the heavens together Without any regrets Forgetting our betrayal Wind, wind I'm going to close the windows with this wind I was coming up to close them There's such a draft What's wrong? Fosco is coming home tomorrow My little Fosco! And what are you doing, jumping out the window for joy? Help me I don't know what to do Why are you telling me this garbage?
