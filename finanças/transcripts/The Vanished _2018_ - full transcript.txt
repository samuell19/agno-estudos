Kim Sang-kyung Kim Kang-woo Kim Hee-ae Directed by Lee Chang-hee THE VANISHED Jin-han, Don't think about it too much You should take a rest I've been thinking about you, Are you alright? I'm thirsty Can you get me a drink? Hey, What is he doing? Probably shopping online. Ok, I've finished the report. - I did that. - Thank you. I think we should bring the witness to the hospital. We can report it later. The captain is on the way here, Wait a moment. His phone is off, forget it. He can't do anything anyway. I think we can solve this case. But this is a big case. We can't take it lightly. His job now is just to entertain. But I've heard, the captain's a legend in the police force. He solved the Gansha case. A real legend, that's what i've heard. No one's seen it. I saw it, it's on the news. He even got a medal from the president. The president will ask him to return the medal. Try to think, Why was he posted here? Wasn't it an order from the top? Because of his performance. What do you mean? No one's ordered him. Even though he likes a drink, he's still a great police officer. If you've got a problem with that, don't invite us. Don't you remember that incident, a month ago? What's that? Isn't that the captain's car? What a 'Super Cop'. Oh, my stomach hurts. Sir! Your car's bumper broken? Forget it. I'm planning to change my car next year. You've been saying that. Why was your phone off? The battery - When I tried to answer your call, it died. You should change your phone rather than your car. Go and buy a new phone. Replace the car, you can use it straightaway... but if I replace my phone, I need to set up this and that data... It's too much trouble! Moreover, these new mobiles are complicated. You said there was something important? I want to go to the funeral. Huan's mother's funeral. Who's that? You don't know him. Hey! Set your alarm for 12 p.m. What for? I need to go to the funeral. The investigation is on-going. He received a blow to the back of the head. Did he faint? Does he work here? Yes, he's been working here four years, but he doesn't remember anything else before he fainted. The guards are always scared... when a phone rings in the middle of the night. I think he was scared. But, he said he saw a ghost. - Ghost? - Yes, it sounds ridiculous. Do you want to see one? See what? A ghost? Cut the crap. So what now? He seems a bit calmer now. Seriously, not that.. Ah, of course... He doesn't have an alibi, but he's got no motive either. It's not like him. Yeah... he doesn't look the type to do that. Let's not be the bad guys, Let him go. Alright.. How did the CCTV get broken? Not broken, Not functioning because the power was off. I haven't been able to get into the control room yet. - Why? - The door's locked. Who's responsible? The guys from repair and maintenance. The door's locked because of the power cut. It can only be opened with a password. Great, one problem after another. Tell them to unlock it, quickly! Yes, got it. Any signs... of a break in? Everything's locked up, nothing can get in or out. In your opinion? We don't have any evidence yet. Yoon Seol-hee, 45 years, President & Director; Barron Pharmacy. The daughter of a big Corporation owner; Chaebol Group. Husbands Name: Professor Park Ji-han. He also works for the company. They're a power couple; elites. They had an extravagant wedding ceremony. Initial investigation shows the cause of death was Myocardial Infarction. Her body was stored here post mortem. That's all the information we have right now. Suk-won. Yes? Where did you get the cover? On the internet. Please get me one, the cover's great. It's clear, the body disappeared from here. I've simplified it for the reporters. But I'm sure they'll be back tomorrow. For what, the stolen corpse? I've heard of traditions that treat a corpse in specific ways. Even so, it doesn't make sense. Yoon Seol-hee. Baptismal name: Veronica. What's the connection? Hey, What are you doing... have you contacted the husband? Husband? He's hard to reach. Damned kid, are you fooling with me? He means... His wife just passed away. His mood is probably not that great. D'you think I'm in the mood to work today? Contact the husband, quickly! How does it feel? It's only been six weeks. It's the seventh week, are you sure there's nothing? Some women feel it around now. Hye-jin. Hello? What… What do you mean; the body is missing? I'm... I'm coming over now. Who was that? Jin-han! The police… There's a problem. Her body's missing? How's that possible? I'm going to take a look. Can't you get someone... to represent you? No, people may misunderstand. Don't worry. Don't eat too late. We just ate together right. Do you have any headache medication? It's in the drawer... What's it for? I'll call you. [Parking Violation Ticket] What was that? I just dropped something. Don't worry. Did I tell you to wear that shirt? No? It doesn't suit you. You look like a school boy. Change your tie. Ok. I will. How was your business trip? Boring. Nothing interesting. You need to rest after a long journey. Don't drink too much, even though you like it It's not good for your health. Have a drink with me. I have to go. I have an important meeting and teaching assignments. Secretary Kim will report on the meeting. Secretary Kim won't be there today. What? I'm not satisfied with his work. He can't overcome small matters. He makes mistakes. A few days ago I was visiting my mother. She's still weak after the operation. I asked for his help... You were busy, but still found time to visit her. Your mother wants you... to stay away from me. I just wanted to see her... and he said he wouldn't tell you. No, I ordered him to tell me everything. Why do you always have to be in control? You don't think of me. Because this is my business. Fine. It's my fault. Finish your drink and take some rest I really like this. Let's go for a walk. Don't work today. You think... my work isn't important. Cute. You're so cute when you're angry. Sorry to call you this late, Please come in. We apologize once again, for calling you tonight According to the security report, around 8:10pm last night... The guard heard a suspicious sound from inside the morgue... and found Yoon Seol-hee's corpse missing. However, the guard's statement can't be fully relied upon. He was in shock. His statement keeps changing. [Hye-jin] Please continue. Yes. As per what the security guard reported... [Hye-jin: There is an unknown number calling me] Please... Like I said, we don't accept this explanation. I'm sorry, can we get to the point? It looks like someone stole your wife's body. You can't smoke here. Let it be, it's ok. It was stolen from a government building... as if it's a corner store. It's not that. I think you misunderstood me. Then who do I have to talk to? Your boss? Can I talk to your boss? We are here to find your wife's body. Find? We are sorry. We need your statement. I'll try to help. Okay. Can you think of anyone who wasn't happy with or had a problem with your wife? I can't. Is there a business rival or someone... There's no one. How about you? You're accusing me of stealing it? Oh, it's not like that. I mean... Is there someone with a grudge against you, who might retaliate by transferring it to your wife? No one. What about other corpses? Only my wife's corpse is missing? The suspect... doesn't seem to be interested in the others. The suspect didn't touch any of the other corpses. Name: Yoon Seol-hee All the zippers on the other body bags are intact. All zipped up and in place. It they had been opened, it would be obvious. Therefore the perpetrator didn't touch the other corpses. So the suspect only targeted Yoon Seol-hee's corpse. But, who would take her corpse? Oh, there's something else. This door opens inward... and closes by itself. However there's something weird. The floor near the door. There are marks on it. Does it matter if there were two perpetrators? Yes, because someone wedged the door open... and I think... that's what was used. Something heavy wedged the door, so the corpse could be removed. Professor Park... May I have a cigarette? Captain. Captain? Doctor Cha is here. She would like to ask you some questions Mr Park. Your wife flew back from the US this morning... despite her phobia about flying. The initial examination indicated symptoms of stress. But let me ask, did President Yoon... have a history of mental disorders ? You mean... My wife is not sane? No, but there's a medical record from a psychiatrist. Although the details are obviously confidential. Please check them carefully. However, as her husband you should have known. I'm sorry... What... is this about? I have an alternative theory. Have you ever heard of suspended animation? What was that? What do you mean? Are you suggesting my wife's not dead? Doctor Cha. What's the meaning of this? A dead person coming back to life? It is just possible. I recall a case of misidentification of death, although the funeral took place soon after. It's not possible, if she's aware she would seek help. Try to think this over. It may not make any sense, but there is a remote possibility. That's enough of your theory. This is the National Science Centre. This is a case of theft, don't complicate it unnecessarily. Then who stole it? What about this myocardoal infarction? I'm not the one who examined her, but it's 99% certain. 1%! Forensic principle. Death is caused by murder. The post-mortem later determines the details. Without a corpse, the post-mortem can't be done. The evidence is gone. If Yoon was murdered? Who is the perpetrator? Who'll benefit most from her death? Hei Sun-wok, Him! He stinks. No, perhaps not. Sorry. Captain, I was thinking. Professor Park identified the corpse himself. That's true, but you can't automatically suspect him. The death certificate will be released soon... although he could inherit all of Yoon's assets. You sound like... you're starting to think like him. He's from an elite family. We forgot the first hypothesis, I want to ask another question. You said that your wife had no enemies. Do you know anyone who is close to her? Her niece, She doesn't have many friends. Did you...ever suspect your wife of having an affair? Or perhaps it's you... having an affair with another woman? You mean I'm cheating? Yes. You know what i mean? No. - How do you know? - Which one ? Are you sure she didn't know... that you were having an affair? She's my wife, of course I knew. Mr Park Jin-han, where were you around 9-10pm tonight? Why do you ask? We called your home, looks like you weren't there. Is that a problem? Can you clarify where you were? I went to the pharmacy to buy some medication. I got your phone call there. You came straight away after receiving the call? Yes. May I see, what medication you bought? Detective, do you suspect me? From your car's windscreen. It looks like a parking ticket. You spent a long time at the pharmacy. Whats the meaning of this? You lost a body. So why are you asking me this? Professor, it wasn't us.. - It's our job to investigate. - Investigate! I've never heard of investigations like this. Of course, this is a first for you. Exactly. I would like to contact my lawyer. Please do, of course. - Captain - Yes? It's 12 now you were supposed to go to a funeral. It's cancelled. Cancelled ? A funeral cancelled ? Lawyer, can we discuss? Why are you excited all of a sudden? Captain, you're not being objective. Actually, I'm a very subjective person. However, if your wife is alive... You should feel relieved? Some people react like that, but if it's too shocking, they can react differently. But that's not normal. There's something suspicious. You're not the victim, it wasn't your love who died. The trauma... Yes, the trauma. This disease... I'm sorry. I'm getting older, I get insensitive No. The Doctor Cha I know isn't someone like that. Thats a long time ago, forget it. You should know, I really care about you. Get more exercise and eat healthily. Don't drink too much. Don't do this to yourself. Then how can I redeem myself. Why do you always... What's happening? It was developed as an anaesthetic, but not for public use. It needs only 0.5ml for a reaction. It dissolves in water, and is odourless. But it's deadly. Within eight hours of injection... The body is paralysed and you slowly lose consciousness. Then death! But do you know what's worse than that? Worse? Worse than death?? No trace. No trace is left in the victim. Even a post-mortem can't detect the cause of death. Beneficial for those with evil thoughts. This sort of thing... should be destroyed. No. This could be very useful. Cause of death, Rain? Turn on the main switch. Mr. Park Jin-Han, What're you doing? I...heard a sound from in here. Why is this item here? It belongs to my wife. You kept it? Check the list of items. The phone isn't here. Can I see your pockets. What? Please empty your pockets, onto the table. Do you think I took her phone? - Just take it out. - What? I just saw you. You have no right to spy on me. I'm asking you one more time, please take it out! How can a policeman be so rude? What are you doing? Take it out, quickly! What is this? I've got no idea. I am the victim's family. You can't do this. Do you know what this is? It's not from here. - Can the contents be examined? - Yes. I do not know anything. Please contact my lawyer. Mr. Park Jin-han, you still don't understand? You need to stay here until the analysis is complete. You think I don't know! Likewise with us! So you stay here until everything is clear! Yes, Sir. - Hey, I want to know... - who are you investigating now. Park? Yes, I'm already on it. - Are you crazy? How dare you! - Let him go now. Yes, I'm sorry. I'll be finished very soon... - Finished? Do it or you'll be finished first! - Give me your word you're not going to screw this up. - Why do you have to cause me so much trouble? It's not that... but Professor Park is in possession of the suspected murder weapon. - What? Murder? - You're killing me! - I don't care about that, stop it immediately. Yes. Ok? Can I go now ? Please inspect the contents of the medication now. And you, Professor. Please remain here. Didn't you hear your superior? Damn it! This phone is getting worse. The speaker's like a megaphone. Get someone to watch over Mr. Park. Stay on top of everything. Yes. This is the basement with the control room, unlike the floor above. Do you see? The difference is here. Try checking if there's a connecting tunnel. I've marked the location. - Now ? - Get it done. Is it true that Yoon's lawyer is his family? Yes. - Have you contacted them? - Yes, I made an appointment. Please ask about their joint properties. Ok. Damn, this is a new pair of shoes. What are we doing in this weather? The professor is weird. That medication is suspicious. It's not that, The captain is even stranger. It's unusual he's that serious. You are also overreacting. I hope this case is settled fast. I need to pee. Sir! Over there. Okay. - Hey, you see that? - Yes, I see it. Seriously, do you see it? Yes, it looks very small. Hey...hey. What's this? Shall we go in? No, I'm not going in. Ah, it looks like my life... Messy! Are we really going to get overtime pay? Counting what's broken. I haven't touched anything yet. You surprised me! - Hello. - Yes, yes. How did you get in? The size is 70x65cm... ..and it's heading out. It's about 30 metres long. In my opinion, this could be the perpetrator's way in. Well done. Good work. So, if the electricity goes out, the door can't be opened? It's not that, it's because the password was changed. Who changed it? I don't know. Not us. So then, how was the monitor damaged? The cable's burnt. There's a broken cable that got exposed to the rain. So it shorted. This is so strange. Such things shouldn't happen. You mean someone deliberately damaged it ? Yes, I believe so. Why is this on? This camera is facing the road. This is operated by the government, right? Yes, this one is different, it's not on our network. Really? Does that mean there's a recording? There should be. Sorry, it's taken this long to call you. Let's eat later. Where's the toilet? Oh. Over there. - Jin-han For the time being don't contact me. I don't want you involved. But I'm worried. Who was it called? - I don't know. I don't dare answer. Then, what did the police say? Someone stole her body. That's impossible. Who? I don't know. I think it's odd as well. I saw...TH-16 among her remains. Hasn't everything been destroyed? Yes, I'm sure I've destroyed it. Did you tell someone else? Are you crazy? I wouldn't do that. - It's possible... it's someone she fired. No, that can't be. Nobody knows about TH-16. [For Professor Han. My love.] Professor Han! Hye-jin! What's happened? What did the doctor say ? Stay calm, I'm fine. Baby? The baby's alright? The baby is fine, I just fell and hurt my hands. Really? Nothing serious? Did anyone record it on their phone ? How about a CCTV recording? The police have checked it, but there's nothing. Do you remember the car? I was scared... I only remember it was black. Don't you have an appointment today? Thank God you're okay. You're home. Sorry, I had a lot of work. You didn't answer my call. I was in a meeting. You weren't in the research room. I was meeting people who want to invest in our project. That new drug development project is too time consuming. Then what, do you want to stop? We've gone this far. What about the employees? Director Wen will handle that. Director Wen knows about this ? In your current situation, do you think you can refuse? Sorry. I will not forget that. Have you forgotten the more important things? That's my fault. I'll check my schedule and we'll go together. Do you still love me? Of course. Why are you asking that? We go to the US for a year? Ok, I'll consider that. Do you need something? A new car? No, I don't. You bought me one yesterday. You know you can't leave me. But it's complicated... It's complicated to be with you. - Hello? Jin-han? Someone knows about our relationship. Professor? The captain is looking for you. That means... She was murdered? You know how the forensic doctor works. To determine cause of death... What have you shown them? The agreement. What is necessary? That... Agreement? Oh...this is terrible. Can I bring this up? Lawyer Yoon? This is the main door's CCTV. It recorded a vehicle passing by at the time of the incident. Look at this. That's your car Mr. Park... and that's my car. My staff's car... and an ambulance. What does that mean? Besides... there are no other vehicles. Very likely, the perpetrator didn't come in a vehicle. That means... he walked up the hill. But how? Walking down a hill while carrying a body... Is very, very difficult. So how did he do it? Her body must still be around here. I will look for it, You can't go yet. 20th July, 2007? Is this broken? Boss calling Come on. Suk-won calling Do you have something? We're heading to Yoon Seol-hee's office. What for? - It's hard to explain over the phone, - but there's something odd... What's odd? Someone sent a message to Yoon's lawyer. - I'm at the office. The sender is Yoon Seol-hee. - What? - it could be a practical joke... - so we'll go and make sure. Okay, keep me informed. What? Captain, we found foot prints. What? Footprints? Yes, but this is really weird. Women's footprints. - Size 23.5 All right. Proceed. What's wrong? - Come here - What's all this? I'm not sure what's going on. It's better over here. What happened? What else? - Jin-han Do you remember the number that called you earlier? 4104. Do you recognise it? Thats... Seol-hee's number. What ? Hye-jin. Stay there and don't go anywhere. Lock the door. Don't worry. - Jin-han, you're scaring me. - Jin-han, can you hear me? - Jin-han? Seol-hee is alive! What was that? Yoon Seol-hee. She was here. - What do you mean? 20th July. Only Seol-hee and I know. She did it.... and made the police suspect me. Do they... know about that? That's not the problem. I'm innocent. There's no evidence. You said she was dead... - how can that be? Maybe TH-16 had no effect on her nervous system. That. Due to drugs. Drugs could have affected her nervous system... - preventing the infection. What does that mean? Was that woman a drug user? No. She seems to have known from the start. Seol-hee won't die that easily. Do you think... she'll come back for revenge? Hello? Hye-jin? Hello? Hello? Sure enough. Impossible. This is a work of a troublemaker. Can I trace the person... who sent this message? Ah...yes, but the procedure is complicated. [Sender: Yoon Seol-hee] [Receiver: Ms.Yoon Seol-hee. President. Barron Pharmacy] Sending a letter to yourself? This was found in the toilet. Someone discarded a cigarette butt. That caused the fire and activated the sprinklers. This looks like one of Mr Park's cigarettes. Captain! Have you analysed those contents? It's similar to a central nervous system destroyer. It behaves just like a poison. A poison? Can I see the report? I'll need some time to complete it. Is there any chance it's deliberate? That's why her body was stolen. - Work on that. - Yes. [Boss] Here it is. - Joong-Sik, where are you? The National Science Centre. - You're still handling that case... - Didn't I tell you to stop? Boss, please send more men here. - What? Are you crazy? That drug has been confirmed as a killer poison... - Joong-sik. Look at the situation. - His wife died today. - What do you do? - You should be familiar with this situation. - He'll be annoyed... - with how you're treating him. Stop it. - I'm coming over right now. - Do nothing more. Understand? Please hear me out, Boss... Dammit. You'd understand this situation. Ji-young, Where are you? I'm sorry. [Ji-young's parents.] I've put it on the calendar. - It's okay, you're busy. We'll go another day. Where are you now? - We're heading home. How are you getting back? There are plenty of buses here. - It's out of town. - My leg hurts - I'll be finished soon. Shall I pick you up? - No need to. - We won't be long. - Sir, please check this. We'll be back soon. We'll be home shortly. Don't worry. You're cute when you panic. [Yoon Seol-hee] Hello? Who is this? Hello? Hello? [Yoon Seol-hee. Missed calls.] - The number you dialed cannot be reached... [I'm waiting for you at our secret place. 20th July 2007] - Please leave a message after the tone. Hye-jin. My phone is dead. Please call this number. No, I'll call you... So pick up immediately. Why don't you ever listen? Damn. Where's Professor Park? The suspect Park Jin-han is inside. Suspect? Where's the proof? Take him, Take him away. I will show you the proof. You know, you need to have proof before you detain someone. Why must you make me do this in the middle of the night? That man needs to be arrested! We need a lot of people, searching... for two or three hours. As soon as we find the body, it's finished. What does that mean? Don't just stand there! Boss, Please hear me out... You want to die? You dare touch me? Detective, let's talk this over. You're laughing? Ok, fighting and obstructing the work of police officers. Ok, ok. Release me. I know, I know. Just wait a minute... Catch him...hold him! Let go! What now? This is him, Boss. Sir, can you and I have a talk? Mr. Park, there are still matters to discuss. Please, take a seat. It's true, Professor. The situation... isn't that good. Sorry for causing a problem. - Get it done now. - Yes. - Sir... - Have a seat first. Over here. Are you pretending? Come on. What do you want now? Professor Park Jin-han. When was the last time you saw Yoon Seol-hee? Did you find the body? No, but we have something else. [Prenuptual Agreement] Professor. Yoon's nephew is the lawyer. It is surprising... that there was a prenuptial agreement. 'If either party A or B has an affair, Party A can file for divorce. Party B will have no claims on the estate.' Then, why? Hear me out first, this is interesting. Yoon Seol-hee... arranged all this. JJC... Private Detective. In short. This private detective was assigned to watch you, Mr. Park... And they have the evidence. You were caught red handed, so you had to kill Seol-hee. Let's listen to this recording. - It's all done. - I'll do it after Seol-hee returns. - I'll make it to look like a result of her flying phobia. This recording was made, the day before her death. The detective gave this recording to Seol-hee, but she couldn't confirm it. So she kept it. And now she can't confirm it... because she's dead. Killed by you! He confessed? - Joong-sik - Yes. Have you got a confession? Just a bit more, give me time... - You need time ? - Yes I'm giving you an hour. To get the confession or find me the body... Who's this ? Ah...just as I thought. Look! You should be thankful. I'm waiting for the good news. Understand? Yes. Hello ? Yes, it's not like that.... [I'm waiting for you at our secret place] Hye-jin. Where are you? I'm at home, Are you okay? What's wrong with your phone? - I can't reach you. Hye-jin. Listen to me. - I'm listening. - Please don't worry. The door... What ? - Did you lock the door? Yes. Don't put down the phone. Walk...towards the door. - What's going on? Please don't ask. Just do what I say. Listen... I think someone's watching our home. What do you mean by someone? Move away... and behave like it's nothing. Ok. - Hye-jin. Are you there? Jin-han… - that woman... Hye-jin ! Hye-jin ! Hye-jin ! [I'm waiting for you at our secret place] Let go! What do you want? What is this ? Hye-jin... Hye-jin will be killed! Who? Hye-jin? Let me go! Seol-hee is goin to kill Hye-jin! Professor Park. Your wife is dead. Go back inside. She's not dead. Ah..my back! Seriously... this is troublesome. We've sent officers to her address. Now you can tell me everything? Hye-jin? You can start with her. Not long after the drug development began. I refocused on teaching... and concentrated on my classes. In the research and development of a medical product, what is the most important factor? Yes. The number of lives that can be saved. Maybe...that's the point. What medication are we talking about here? That's when I first saw her. She wasn't a student from my class, but seemed very curious. She always met me after each lesson... and asked a lot of questions. Why isn't this revealed? The risks and costs are great. It requires a lot of research, costs, time, and... Why do you want to know? This isn't your course. I'm always serious about learning. What are your goals in life? What do you want to be? What's become of my dream is... Hey... I'm not asking you to dream. I also want to love someone... I'm not asking about that. At your age, you know nothing, but having fun and being unreliable. I'm not interested in that. And it happened all of a sudden. I didn't think it would be a problem. Wow...Professor. What's your desire? Why not try it again? You're a smart man. Dreams... sometimes we have to face reality instead. Oh, do you say that to your students? I'm just a trophy for Seol-hee. The woman must get what she wants. And she doesn't care about what I want. I'll try again. Shall I pull your hair back? Professor, you're a strong person. - Me? - Yes. A very interesting man. It was early on... And then Seol-hee... became suspicious. From now on, you have to go to the office every day. I have classes. What's more important? I'm ordering you. Just do it. [Hye-jin calling.] Based on the results of the analysis It's safe enough to proceed. I wanted to stop it. Because I knew what Seol-hee was like. But it wasn't easy. Hye-jin. We must forgo our dreams and accept the situation. Being with Hye-jin... made me happy. She understood me. Then she became pregnant. [Seol-hee] I decided to stay with Hye-jin, - but Seol-hee... - [the number you called...] already knew everything. If it was only about the money, she would have released me, but she will never let me go. She knows my weaknesses. Hello, What's the latest? So you killed her ? No. She made it look like this was my doing. That means you planned everything. As soon as you poisoned Seol-hee, you stole her body... So a post-mortem couldn't be done, and there wouldn't be any proof. You can do it, because you examined the corpse. No. Seol-hee is still alive. She's pretending to be dead. What do you mean? It's possible that... when were researching and developing the new drug, She could have taken it. It reduces lung and heart functions to almost nothing. No heartbeat and no breathing. The body looks like it's dead, but it's only temporary. She got out of here on her own. She can get down the hill easily. So Yoon Seol-hee killed herself, then rose again? She is capable of that. That sort of thing wouldn't be difficult for her. The footprints were hers as well. If that's the case, what about the chaos here? Maybe it's Seol-hee's men. She needed someone to wake her up. She can administer the drug herself. Stop your nonsense! The home address you provided Is registered in your name. I bought the house for her. But no one's there Hey? What's the latest? There's no one here. What? - No one? Yes. There's no sign this house has ever been occupied. It must be Seol-hee's doing. We also checked the university where you teach. Jin Hye-jin? There's no student by that name. Is that Seol-hee's doing as well? We're all being played by that woman. She's been watching us the entire time. She's been planning to kill Hye-jin for a long time. You killed Seol-hee, There is no Hye-jin. I need to go...I need to go... - You'd better confess! - You don't know Seol-hee! Where is her body? I have to go, I need to leave. Are you mad! Are you trying to fool with us? Hye-jin...she could die. Please. Captain... The boss wants to talk to you. Please give me more time. We're here to collect Professor Park. Release him. We've got proof of infidelity: Park Jin-han's mistress. What do you think you're you doing? How's proof of infidelity going to benefit us? Release him. We can't let him go. He's clearly hiding something. Then what are you going to do now? We need proof? We tried. We looked for it in the forest like you said... and found nothing yet. Joong-jik. Release Professor Park, then go home. Professor, are you alright? Professor! This Park Jin-han is difficult. Where's the key, I'll drive. It looks like I left it inside. I'll get it. Where is the room key... [I'm waiting for you at our secret place.] [Boss] How did you...? So you... hid the body here? Imbecile. You should have said so from the beginning. Why did you choose a place like this? It's unexpected. You hid it here? I told you it's not me. It's Seol-hee. She's alive! Are you still saying that? Well, I know it's hard to believe, but I too, had a woman I wanted to marry. Song Ji-young. My lover's name. Look. Isn't she pretty? It was on the anniversary of her parents death. We planned to go together. He was supposed to accompany me, but he's busy. Should I continue? Well... he's a nice person. Who are you talking to? If you were getting married, would you be sad? Of course not. No says you ? Are you going to answer or not? Ji-young, you're getting married, why are you sad? What ? You are so heavy! Really... Does your leg still hurt? Yes, it still hurts. Little liar. Where does it hurts? Tell me. My leg is red and swollen! Your feet are sore. We'll be back soon. Just a while more, don't worry. Whatever it is. Tell me. Anything, please tell me. Hwa-young ! It was a hit and run. The only witness... didn't recall a thing. And in the end, It was all forgotten. What's your address? - Then one day... - the address? I met Hwa-young again. Grandma says you're doing well, and studying diligently. Why are you here? [Not to be taken home.] [Barron Pharmacy Co.Ltd.] It turns out that Hwa-young... never forgot. Baron Pharmacy logo sticker and a black car. And there were also car service logs for Park Jin-han. On that day. 20th July 2007. What do you remember? Where is the body? Where did you bury the body? Here? Where did you bury Ji-young! [20th July 2007.] I must... No one saw it. Maybe... We can overcome this, ok? Who are you calling? Wake up! Think about your future! You were driving drunk!! What should I do now? What else? Let's settle this first. It's nothing Just do what I say. Haven't you realised yet? We are much alike. I thought she was alive as well, because the body was never found. And you think... that Seol-hee is alive ? You... brought Seol-hee... Besides us, there are no other vehicles. The body must be around here. Do you think I'm fooling you? What actually happened? Humans usually only see what they want to see. Have you heard of suspended animation? The guard says he saw a ghost. Who's this? You believe that. Your body will begin to feel stiff. My body… True... Like you did to Yoon Seol-hee. Help me... I'm begging you. If you want to live. Where is she? Hye-jin... Who? Hye-jin... it's not her fault. Please.. Please dont arrest her. It's all my fault. I'm begging. Who's that? Is it true Hye-jin is pregnant with your child? How do you think I found you? She is Song Hwa-young, Song Ji-Young's sister. She would have been an ordinary student, if not for you. Why are you telling me? I have to do this. Can't I just shut up and watch? Sometimes life... doesn't match up to our dreams. It was very hard for us to fight you. Hiding evidence for two years. Very lucky. Do you think they'll admit everything? Then, what? We can't sue them, and we can't find Ji-young. Just kill them! I forgot. This wasn't only my problem. Because I died... a long time ago. Let's hope ... We don't meet in Hell. Don't This could be useful. Can you get me a drink? I've never told anybody... that actually… It's nothing. Are you okay? Park Jin-han, Wake up. Park Jin-han. You're under arrest for murdering Yoon Seol-hee and... stealing her body. We'll take your statement at the police station. Come on. Why? What's this? - What are you doing? - Making a report? Yes. Ok, it's done. - Look at this - Detectives. Yes? We found this in his room. Look. What is it? Ketamin? It's drugs? Yes, it seems like he uses it. We found needle marks on Park Jin-han's arm. So the Professor turned out to be an addict. Not suprisingly. This was very strange from the start. Have you contacted the captain? Didn't you tell me not to care about him? When did I say that? Last night. Oh...I don't think I said that. But, what the captain did was amazing. Yeah, he's incredible. [Suk-Won]
