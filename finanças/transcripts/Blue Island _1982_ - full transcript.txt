BLUE ISLAND - SALT ON BARE SKIN Excuse me. I didn't want this. First call for TWA Flight 734 to Sydney. Gate A. Departure for Sydney, Gate A. We have just been informed that last night... an airplane has crashed. The aircraft which was en route from Rome to Sydney disappeared over the Indian Ocean. At this moment there is no information on the cause of this accident. The aircraft was carrying 180 passengers and 10 crew. As we have no heard anything more... we are assuming there are no survivors. And next, the latest sports news. Hey! You there! Can you see me? Help me! What's your name? Billy, why? Billy. And where are you from, Billy? - Heaven. Are you an angel? - I think you'd like that. Aren't you the guy who spilled all over his shirt at the airport? Yes. And you dropped your magazines. Well, get in. Do you have any water? - I already drank it all. We'll die of thirst. - No. Still, we are going to die. Don't think of that. We'll make it through this. It's water. Wake up! It's raining, we're saved! What is it? - It's raining. It's raining! It's raining! Thank God! A miracle. We're going to live! We're going to live! Yes, we're saved! Hey, Bonnie! - What is it? An island. Let's try to get there. You slept for ages. - I was dreaming. What were you dreaming about? - A blue lagoon. Do you know the movie, The Blue Lagoon? - No, why? What does that have to do with us? It's hard to explain. - Why? You know, this whole situation. The two of us, here. It's just like in the movie. It's a story about two children... who manage to survive alone on an island after they got ship wrecked. Tell me more. - Well, they get stranded on this island... Hey, don't stop now! - I'll be right back. That trunk is holding us back, why don't we cut it loose? No, that saved my life. They might bring us good luck. - As you wish. Do you always dream with your eyes open? Usually, yes. - Me too. Like on the bus, when I'm going to school. Or during practice. Now I'm not so sure anymore. - Not sure? What do you mean? Do you think you're dreaming? Yes. Maybe that island doesn't really exist. If you were really dreaming, what would that mean for us? I don't know. But everything about this reminds me of that movie. Well, go on then. What happens next? Do they survive? - They do. They build a large shelter, and... - And? They fall in love. - Oh that. I'm hungry. Great Madness! Billy! Billy! - Madness! Wait for me, Billy! Where are you going? Can you tell me what's wrong? It's true. I really am dreaming. I'm dreaming. - And I'm starving here. When you're hungry all you have to do... is reach out your hands and eat. - Eat what? Look around you. There's fresh fruit everywhere. Coconut, banana, mango. You can have whatever you want. I want a Cheeseburger with French fries. And then a large scoop of vanilla icecream and whipped cream. Vanilla. - It's my favorite. The fruit will do for me. I think you can forget about that ice cream. You may be right about that. Tastes fine, doesn't it? I have an idea. Where are you going? - The beach. I want to see what's in that trunk. Wait for me! I want to come with you. Can you get it open? - You think I can't open a stupid trunk? I can ask, can't I. Would you look at that! I wonder who this belongs to. I didn't know feet could get that big. - Must have been a giant. Well, you still think that you're dreaming. But these shoes are real. - Maybe a clown. I don't think so. - A giant? There's no such thing. I know that. But look at these shirts. I've never seen anything like them. I'll try one on. - Pick one. Well, do you like it? - Looks like it was made just for you. The trunk is full of this stuff. - Shirts, pants, shoes. Maybe we can use some of it. Look at this. A giant pacifier. What are you doing? A knife. That will be useful. Guess what I found. Do you want to dance? - No, I can't dance. Bonnie, look at this giant mattress. Bonnie! What is it? You were going to help me. Now I've done it all by myself. - Just leave me alone. What is it? The sun is going down awfully fast, isn't it? It will be dark soon. What are you thinking of? - Home. When I found that trunk... my first thought was 'I'm going to survive this'. Somehow I'll make it. And then I thought of home. Are you worried about your family? They're probably more worried about me. And you? - They probably think I'm dead. They'll find us. I hope so. Do you have any brothers or sisters? There were 8 of us. 2 girls and 6 boys. That many? Maybe they don't know yet that we're missing. Ah, dear, innocent, sweet Billy. I don't want to upset you. You know, I'm the only girl out of 7 children. Ah, that explains the vanilla ice cream. You've been spoiled, haven't you? With us, you could never say you didn't like something. Before you know it, your plate would be empty. We were always hungry. I wasn't spoiled either. Let's get some sleep. Good idea. Sleep well, Bonnie. - You too. ♪ Bonnie's hungry! Bonnie's hungry! ♪ And Billy can't catch a fish. ♪ Billy is stupid. - Knock it off already! ♪ Bonnie's hungry! Bonnie's hungry! ♪ Billy is stupid. I must be doing something wrong. I've had enough of this. That's not very smart. - Let's see you get your fish now. It was your idea to go fishing. Don't be in such a bad mood. You know, I'll try again later. Ah, and you think you'll do better? Come on Billy. I don't want to argue with you over some stupid fish. Let's do something useful. Like what? - Get to know the island. What? - This could be a very remote island, but there could be a town a few miles from here, with lots of people. - And vanilla ice cream. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to get out of here? I see, I don't want to get leave, I'm in a bad mood. Bonnie, try to understand that... we're on a deserted island. But we have to do something. We can't just sit around and go fishing all day. Maybe there's other people here. No. - And how would you know that? You really want to argue, don't you? - No, I don't. I can understand this place is getting on your nerves. It's not. I just want to do something. Bonnie. We're all alone here. We should really try to get along. You're right, Billy. We should be glad we got out of the airplane alive and well. It's not you. It's probably just... I haven't completely accepted this yet. Try to understand me, Billy. I need some time on my own. Bonnie, that's not possible. Bonnie! It's too dangerous! We should stay together. Billy, just for a little while. - Just stay close will you. Are you going to be standing over my shoulder when I go pee too? Fine. Sometimes I'm a little slow. I'm going fishing again. - Finally. I got one. I got one! Bonnie! I caught a fish! Billy, how did you do that? How did you get the fire going? Glasses. - Glasses? How did you get glasses here? - They were in the trunk. You're right. It was a good idea to bring the trunk with us. How is it? - I've had better. A bit burned. Do you like fish? - Not especially. You? We had fish a lot back home. Then why aren't you eating? - You were so hungry. You're not? - I'll catch another one later. I think I've got it now. I'll catch us a dozen fish every day. Until we get sick of it. We'll think of something. The only question now is, where do we get vanilla ice cream? Come on! - Wait for me! For what? - Wait for me! It's beautiful. You took your shirt off. - What? Did you think I'd go swimming with my shirt on? No, I just... I mean, I didn't expect.... What? - Well, seeing you like this. How would you see me then? This isn't anything special. You're very beautiful. - Thank you. Tell me, you've never seen a naked woman before? No, coach won't let us... - What won't he let you? Well, he won't let us think of girls. He thinks we should only be thinking of our training. And you listened to him? You can't be serious. Bonnie! Bonnie, where are you? Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie! Wait for me! - Just try an catch me! Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Just stand still for a moment. Stop running away! But I didn't run away from you. Get over here. What is it then? - Can you hear that? It's just the wind. You're right. That might be water. - Let's go take a look. Water! We found water! Finally. I'm getting sick and tired of that coconut milk. Let's go in. It's freezing. What did you say? - I said it's freezing. Well, what do you think? - It's not exactly comfortable... but we could use it as a shelter. Then we have a house. Billy, do you have a girlfriend? - A girlfriend? No, no girlfriend. I told you already, coach wouldn't let us think of that. And you listened to him. I don't have a boyfriend either. You don't? Have you ever kissed anyone? - Kissed? Once. - What was it like? - Awful. It took me 3 months to get rid of him. I don't get it. - I was just using him for kissing. I really liked this other guy. I didn't want him to know... I'd never kissed anyone before. Wake up. Breakfast is ready. Smells great. - I put all the herbs in... that I could find. I hope it testes good. Not bad. What's that? - I read it in a book once. I think it's called a breadfruit. Go on, try it. How is it? - Pretty awful. The first time I cook for you and you don't like it. Bonnie, I was kidding. I know you tried really hard. Bonnie, it was great! - Leave me alone! Ungrateful prick. - Please don't go. It was really great. Wait up! You ripped my shirt. Are you happy now? I'll never cook for you again. I'm sorry. - Alright. But you can finish that alone. Go on. Why don't you just tell me that you're in love with me? I can tell. - It's not true! Not true! Not true! No, I don't love you. It's not true. I'm not in love with you. Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie! Billy! Billy, what is that? - I found it. All we need now is a sail. - Where did you find it? It washed ashore. - Great. Look. Let's go there. - Sure. Are you asleep? - No. I can't. Do you want to go for a swim? - What, now? Hey! Hey! - What are you scared of? I like watching them fly around. Do you know what kind they are? - No. I can climb up and take a look around. It's too dangerous. - It's nothing. There's a good spot over there. Watch it. Don't slip! - This is easy. Just don't look down. Billy, don't go any higher. I'm scared. I've never seen anything like this before. Come back down, Billy! They just hatched. - Don't hurt them! Let them go! There's eggs here too. Tonight we're having omelette. There's a lot of caves here. We should go see some. Maybe later. What's up - Nothing. I'm not sure. I don't know what's wrong. I just miss my family. And my friends. And I should be happy. We survived an airplane crash. And we have a good thing here. But sometimes I just want to be with other people too. I just miss people. It's like time's standing still here. Every day we hope that they'll find us. But nothing happens. I feel... Got one! - You're kidding. I don't believe you. I'm serious. - Come, show me. Here it is! Where did you learn to set traps? Don't laugh. I was a boy scout. You're great. Did you hear that? An aircraft! To the beach, hurry! We must get to the beach. - Yes. What should I do with this? - Put it in the trunk. Hurry. The beach. Hey! Hey! - Hey! Hey! We're here! Over here! We're here! Don't go! Can't you hear us? Help!? - Hey! Help! Over there, get the cloth. - Yes. They can't miss this. Help us! Help! Can't you hear us? - Help! We're over here! Help! Hey! Hello! - Help! Help! It's gone. - He'll be back. he's got to. I don't think so. Maybe he just couldn't land. No, he would have let us know. I'm sorry, Bonnie. He didn't see us. He would have come back around otherwise. I'm hungry. You? - A little. Today, we're having rabbit. - That's right. Good, think about that. I'm going to get some water. Don't look at me like that. Why did you have to walk into that trap? Did you do it? - Almost. You haven't killed it yet? - Not yet. I'll be right there. - This requires stamina. Go! Get lost. Get out of here! Bonnie? He bit my finger, I had to let go. And now he's gone. Don't lie to me. You let him go. Billy, I like you. Let's get some wood up on that hill and start a fire. Maybe the plane will come back. - Good idea. When he gets back, he's sure to see us. Are you sure? - I'll be sending smoke signals. That's how the indians did it. Ah yes, the boy scout. We've never been here before. Where are you going? I want to see what's over there. Stay here, I'll be right back. It's exactly like ours. How did it get here? Quick, let's get out of here. What's wrong? - Nothing. I just want to go. But you look like... - I don't like this place. Hey, what is it? Is it anything I did? No, why? Why are you looking at me like that? I told you, it's nothing. Bonnie, where are you going? Bonnie, tell me! Hey, wait for me. Hey! Bonnie! Wait up! Bonnie! Bonnie, where are you? Bonnie! Funny. Now stop it. Did I scare you? Were you afraid? Afraid? Me? You should have seen your face. Where did you find that? - Over there in the bushes. Come, let's go. - Don't be so rude. Are you angry with me? - Of course I am. What difference does it make? You haven't said a word in three days. You know, I think whoever owns those shoes is also on the island. You're making fun of me. You want to frighten me. You're just making up something so you won't have to sleep with me. You don't like me anymore. - That's nonsense, Bonnie. We could be in danger. I worry about us. I'm sorry... I didn't want to worry you, but I found footprints in the sand. I'm not a little kid anymore. Why didn't you just tell me... instead of making those faces for the past three days? I told you. I didn't wanna frighten you. Where did you see them? Over there, on the other side of the mountain. And you think he's there? Maybe. Oh Billy, I'm scared. We need to find a safe place for the night. The ridge. - Yes, great idea. We can see the entire island from there. Let's hurry. We need to get some supplies. Is that everything? - I think so, yes. The jacket. Bonnie! - I'm coming. See those dolphins. Look how they're jumping around. Did you see that? When I was a kid I was afraid of everything. Especially water. When I was in bed and they turned off the lights... I always got so scared. I always hid under my blankets. I thought no one could see me there. Are you still scared? Not when I'm with you. I feel safe. You know, after the first time we slept together, I thought you didn't like me anymore. Why? - I don't know. You seemed so distant. It was my fault. I was so anxious. And then I cramped up. It was weird. But I didn't understand it. I can't even tell you if I liked it or not. Do you know what I mean? Maybe that's normal for the first time. Are you even listening to me? - Of course I am. Go on. - I'm done. But... I feel like trying again. More relaxed this time. I'm going to try to enjoy it more. I want to know if it's all it's cranked up to be. Do you want to try again? - No. I'm tired. And cold. Try to get some sleep, Bonnie. I'll stay awake and watch. OK, I'm going to get some sleep. But wake me up and I'll take over. Don't worry. Just sleep. I can see the entire beach from here. I'm incredibly thirsty. Get the fruit ready. I'll get some water. Run, Bonnie! Hey! Let him go! Het him go! Billy, Billy, run! Go on, Billy, Run! God, Billy! Just go! Let him go, you gorilla! Let him go! Let him go!! - Stop that! Don't do that again. I've had enough of this! Run, Billy! - Easier said than done. How do you like that? Stop it, you beast! Wait! You think that tooth pick is going to help you? Come here, you gnat! Bonnie, Run! Run! Into the water! Quickly! Come on, Bonnie! Hurry up! Get over here! Did he hurt you? - I'll be fine. We have to get out of here. I've never seen anyone that big. Me neither. What do we do now? - I don't know. We can fight him, he's too strong. But we can't stay in the water forever. Do you think we could reason with him? We can try. But for now, I've had enough. Why isn't he coming after us? Maybe he can't swim. - Maybe. If he really can't swim, we definitely have the advantage. We need to find out. I'll try to provoke him. No, I will - Bonnie, are you crazy? He's dangerous. Get back here! Bonnie, stop it already! Come back here, Bonnie. Please. Let's just get out of here. - Whatever. You're completely insane. - Maybe. At least now we know that he can't swim. What do you mean, Billy? What do we do now? We'll leave him be for a while. It looks like he's leaving. I hope so. I can't go on much longer. Look at what he did to our hut. Unbelievable. - He took everything. He even drank all the water. We have to get to the spring as soon as possible. We'll get through this. Come here! - Let go! Let me go! Let her go! Let her go, you hear me! Help! Help, Billy! Let me go, you ape! Let me go! Come on, come on! Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. Relax. I already said I wouldn't hurt you. I'm not going to hurt you. Are you hungry? Here, take it! Eat. Why are you afraid. Trust me. I don't want you to be afraid. I'm all alone here. I'm lonely. I'm so glad I found you. Don't hide. I saw you. Come out, Billy. That's Billy. - And that's Bonnie. My name is Shanghai. - You can have dinner with us. That's a good idea. - Are you hungry, Shanghai? The mattress is mine and I want to sleep now. Sure. If you want. One moment, Shanghai. We need to clean up first. We didn't know it was your mattress. So. Done. - Why do you carry a mattress around? I can never find a bed that's big enough for me. That makes sense. I never considered that. Good night. - Good night, Shanghai. I think that if you don't argue with him, he's quite harmless. And what do we do now? Nothing. We just have to be careful. We'll think of something. What are you thinking? - I don't know. We could go to another island. There's plenty of them around. I'd rather be alone with you. I don't want him around all the time. I'd feel sorry for him if we leave him alone here. You heard him. he's lonely. I don't think he has anyone. Come on, he's not a kid anymore. He's used to being alone. Do you want to go for a swim? Of course. I'm just afraid he'll wake up and come looking for us. I'm cold. Hold me. Kiss me. - I love you. Have you ever seen one that big - It's huge. Hey, Shanghai, what are you doing? What is the meaning! Don't do that! Shanghai, why did you do that? Come, let's fight. - Hold up, Shanghai. So, how do you like that? - I know you're stronger. I've had enough of being alone here on this island. We could build a raft. - That's impossible. Nothing's impossible. I'm building a raft. And then we'll leave here. Don't think of it so lightly. - Shanghai is strong enough. Why wouldn't we do it? We just have to believe we can. Do you know how to do this? have you ever built a raft before? We'll get it done. The thing is to get some big logs and tie them together. The sea can be treacherous. Get down there! Do you want to break it? That's refreshing. The wind is right. Are you done? - Shanghai thinks the wind is right. It will have to be. I'm done picking fruit. I'll do it. Jeez, Shanghai, I'm just trying to help. You're coming with me! - Knock it off, Shanghai? Let me go! Hey, Shanghai, stop fooling around! - Knock it off! Listen up! Damnit! - What's the meaning of this? Shanghai, stop it! Leave us alone! That's enough! Wait! Come her! Time to go under! How do you like that? Hey! What are you doing? Listen! I can't swim! No, really. I'm scared! There's currents here! Please! No! It's too deep! No! No! Help! Help! Ciao! Best wishes, Shanghai! Good bye! Bonnie? I'm happy it's just the two of us again. Me too. I'm glad to be rid of him. I really, really love you. - I love you too, Billy. Just kidding! I don't love you at all. - Oh really? I was just kidding! Say that again if you dare. - I was just kidding! I don't love you at all! - Wait a moment! Stop! I want to know if it's true what you just said. Hey, wait! Ciao! You're crazy! Don't do that to me again, you hear me? What was that? I'm cold, Billy. Gold me. Hold me. Hold me tight, Billy. What's wrong with us, Billy? Are we going to die? The raft was a good idea, right? I got caught in a thunderstorm, and some fishermen saved my life. The raft was already falling apart by the time they found me. And then you came back to me. I didn't want to leave my friends behind. I'm not who you think I am. I was just having some fun.
