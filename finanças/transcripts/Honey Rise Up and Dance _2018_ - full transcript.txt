Skyler! I didn't hear you. Girl, I could bang pots and pans outside your door until my blood pressure got the best of me, and you still wouldn't have answered. Sorry. I was dancing. Is that what that's called? Looked more to me like you was possessed by a chicken havin' a spaz attack. - What's up, Ma? - What's up is I'm headin' to work. Oh! Don't forget to fill out that application for the program. Okay? I haven't made up my mind yet. Made up your mind? Look, now that you're done with Greenpeace and finding yourself, you're either getting a full-time job or we agreed you'd sign up for the program. I don't think takin' blood is what I wanna do for the rest of my life. The course is only for three months. You'll have your certificate. Maggie makes $17 an hour. That's good money. I know, but I just don't even like blood. I don't like cleaning hotel rooms either, but I do it so that you girls can have a better life than I had. Listen, I wouldn't be pushing you so hard, but Maggie's pulling a lot of strings to get you a job at the clinic. She's not gonna be there for much longer, so it's kind of now or never. I hear ya, Mom. Why does Tosha get to do what she wants? Baby, you just spent a whole year abroad doing your thing, so don't act like now I'm the Wicked Witch of the West. Well, it's just not fair. Skyler, you're better suited for working with your head. Now, Tosha, on the other hand, she's a natural at dancing, entertaining. - That's her gift. - Right. Your sister barely graduated. Thank God for her gift. Thank God for that. - Love you. - Love you too. What you starin' at, Sis? - Did you see this? - What is that? First prize is a full college scholarship. I did see that. But did you also see the words, "USA Dance World?" They are the best of the best, girl. But you say Pulsar is number one. - In the city. - Why not the country? No, you're right. I mean, why not think big? Especially if we have a dope crew this year, Sky. Who knows? You don't know who's gonna make the crew? Miss J makes everybody audition, even if they were on the team last year. So, you don't even know if you're gonna make the crew, huh? Girl, no, no. I'll make the crew. But she gonna make everybody try out just to keep us humble, girl. - You know her. - Hey, Skyler. - Hey. What's up, y'all? - What's up? You thinkin' of tryin' out? - Have you seen her dance? - Wow. Thanks a lot. No, no, no. I'm just sayin'. - If she wants to try out, let her try out. - Yeah. Why not? 'Cause Pulsar is not for beginners. Thank you, Bryce. Okay, come on. Anyway, I stopped by because you left your phone on the kitchen counter, airhead. - I did? - Yes. - Ooh. - Look, I gotta go. I gotta get to work. So I'm-a see y'all later. - All right. Bye. - Peace. Later, Sky. - Hey, I won't forget what you said. - Okay, don't be... All right, ladies. Now make it sexy. Here we go. Startin' on the left. Five, six, seven, go. Other side. Yes.

I'm tryin' to teach the whole class a routine. This is not the Maya Show. If your head gets any bigger, I'm gonna have to widen the doors. - I was just feelin' it. - Yeah. I didn't mean for it to turn into no battle. Well, that's good, because if it was a real battle, I would've stepped in and crushed you. I'm sorry, Miss J. Won't happen again. Oh, I know it won't. All right, what's everybody starin' at? Class is over. Don't forget, Pulsar tryouts are right around the corner. From what I saw today, some of y'all need some work. Jada's just mad 'cause you're a better dancer then she ever was. - You killed it. - Thanks, girl. You're welcome. Yeah? - Hey, Miss J. - Hey. I was hoping if we have time next class, you could take us through that last combination again. Maya kind of took things off track. Yeah. Maya has a habit of doin' that. - You know what I think her problem is? - What's that, Nia? She thinks she's better than everybody else. Well, to be fair, she is our best dancer. Yeah. When she's saying she's a better dancer than you ever even were, I think that's just straight disrespectful. - She said that? - I shouldn't have said anything. Gotta learn to keep my mouth shut. I'll see you Tuesday. Yo, I'll take one of those, one of those, one of those, and... mm-mm-mm... definitely one of those. - You are so not funny. - I thought you were supposed to be off. - Nope, I got another ten. - Yeah? You tryin' to get me fired? Come on. Give me a little one. You are something else. All right. You be like that. I'm gonna be right over there, countin' the seconds. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm! Girl, your man is a trip. Whoo! I don't know what I see in him. Well, I see exactly what you see in him. Hey, that ass is mine. I'm just sayin', that's all. But lucky for you, I got my man over there on the skates. Hey, baby! Hey, baby. Hey, baby! You know, I really don't like you. You know, I really don't like you. ♪ Hold me And take me off the ground ♪ ♪ Can't take my crown ♪ What happened to the uniform? - I can put it back on if that's what you like. - Nah. I just got a thing for women in uniform. You know your jokes are corny, right? - So you want me to change now, huh? - No. I like corny. What was that? I don't know. But that's on the house. These wings or that kiss? Look. - What's that? - A dance competition. And the first prize is a full four-year scholarship. They're going to enter the Pulsar. - That crew that your sister dances for? - Yes. So, why you showin' me? 'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout joinin' the crew. The Pulsar? You think you're just gonna show up and join? No, but they have open tryouts in two weeks. Yeah, babe, so do the Falcons, but if I tried to walk on there, I'd get slaughtered. You think I'll get slaughtered? No, I don't think you'll get slaughtered. - I think I'm good enough. - Okay. Where's the sudden interest in dancing? That's all I'm asking. What are you talking about? I'm always dancin'. I rap every morning in the shower. - That don't make me Eminem. - Wow! Do not compare my dancing to your rapping. Okay. Okay. Bad comparison. I'm just saying, your sister goes to school for dance. You just dance for fun. Look, this is my chance at potentially gettin' a scholarship. And that too. You never even talked about going to college before. I didn't even think that was an option. I don't have the money for that. That's why you should be happy that your mom's trying to hook you up. You make it sound like she's sending me to Harvard or something. It is a three-month course on collectin' blood and collectin' urine samples. Seriously. And I'm supposed to just thank her for that? Look, if you have a chance to make the Pulsar, go for it. - Are you just sayin' that? - No. Now, you slide over to my place tonight when you get off. Look, I appreciate the proposition and all, but I gotta practice. I gotta get up on my game if I'm serious about joining this crew. The manager said I could stay back and dance after we close, so that's even more lit.

If you're fine with that, who am I to judge? - First off, I'm not her bitch. - So prove it. Here's your chance. Okay, people. Tryouts start in 15. When I call your name, you will have one minute-30 to show me what you got, all right? - Where you goin'? - To the mall. Didn't you just hear me say tryouts start in 15? Well, you can text me and let me know who's gonna be on the crew. Okay. My office. - What? - Now! What the hell were you tryin' to prove out there? You know my rules. Every season it's a new crew. Anybody who wants in tries out, even if they been on the team for three years. Look, it's not fair to the other dancers who work hard all year to improve their skills only to find that they didn't have a shot. I don't know what's gotten into your head lately, but you better start showing me some respect. Now, if you wanna be a part of the Pulsar, you will get back out there and try out like everybody else. - Tosha. - Hmm? - Check it out. - Oh, my gosh. She came. - That girl is my biggest fan. - Oh, you mean besides your mom? Ooh, I stand corrected. That is true. Sis! - What's up? - Look, listen. I appreciate the support. I promise you, I do. But you did not have to come all this way to watch me audition. - It is not that serious. - I know. - But I didn't come to watch you. - Okay. What... Did something happen to Mom? No. She's fine. Oh. - So, what you doin' here? - I'm about to try out for Pulsar. - Yeah. - What? You're trying out for this team? Yeah. Okay, that was good. You got me. 'Cause that was a joke, right? No. I'm not playin'. - Yeah, you go, girl. - Why are you... - Jamaica, go back! Go back. - Sorry. I mean, what do I have to lose? Skyler, we talked about this. Pulsar is not for beginners. And I don't wanna see you get up there and embarrass yourself or hurt yourself or do anything like that. - Embarrass myself? - Yes, Skyler. I really think you might be nervous that I might make the team. - I'm nervous? - Yeah. I'm just lookin' out for you, Sky. That's it. Well, okay, good, 'cause I'm gonna need you to be cheering for me. Cheer for you... Skyler! All right, everybody. Let's get this show on the road. Start with the fellas. Guys, you're up.

Shouldn't we go look? We just don't wanna look desperate. See, that's fine with me. I was the last name on the list last year. - Come on. Let's go be desperate together. - Okay. Let's go. I made it. I made it. - How did that happen? - Yeah, how did that happen, Jamaica? - Seriously, dude? - No, I'm just kidding. Jamaica, you know we got your back, bro. - Hey, I made it though. - Hey, yo! At least you tried. I'm sorry, Sky. You did well. Come on. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Congratulations. You are all Pulsar now. Hey! All right, all right. For our dancers who are new to the crew, I expect you to learn fast and live up to the crew's reputation. And for those members who are returning, I expect you to raise your game, so don't think you can rely on what you did last year, okay? - Don't forget about Angelique. - Ah. We do have one minor hiccup. As you may have noticed, Angelique is not here. She had to withdraw because her family is moving back to West Virginia. So, her spot will be going to our alternate, Skyler. - What? - Who? Skyler. And since she's your sister, I will let you have the honor of giving her the good news. Oh, okay. Well, she'll be surprised for sure. All right. Let's spread out and stretch. - Hello? - Hey, girl. - Hey. - I got some good news. It actually looks like you made Pulsar. What? Nah, you lyin'. But, listen, we're rehearsing right now, and I know you're busy, so if you can't make it... No, no. No, I'm on my way.

What are you doing here so early? - Just checkin' to see if you're okay. - Why wouldn't I be? Oh, I've been callin' you all night. Oh, damn. My battery died yesterday, and by the time we got home, I done forgot to put it on the charger, I was so tired. Oh, no, babe, that's fine.

I wasn't tryin' to show off, Miss J. I really wasn't. Well, where'd you learn those moves? Or did they just come to you? No, I've been working with a friend. He's been showin' me some of his moves. Yeah, well, I saw you on the security cam. Looked like he was showin' you more than just moves. It's not what it looked like. Honestly. Look, Skyler, I don't want you messin' with the likes of that boy. He's trouble. I know he look a little rough, but he's really not like that. I think I have a pretty good idea of what he's like. He's my son. - What? - Look, I don't want you to take this wrong because you are a beautiful young woman, but the reason Tyrell is involved with you is to get back at me. But I don't... I don't understand. We haven't spoken in the past two years. Messing with one of my dancers is another of his games. So if you don't want to be played, stay away from him. But what happened? I've said more than I want to. - But I just... - I'll see you in rehearsal tomorrow. Babe, what's goin' on? Nothin's up. I'm just... not in the mood. - What's on your mind? - Too much. I'm just, like... Everything is just so stressful with work and... Rehearsals with Pulsar, and my mom is still on my back about this medical assistant's course. It's just annoying. I'm over it. Come here, baby. Come here. Just take it one day at a time, and everything will be okay. - I guess. - You worry too much. You know that? As long as everything's okay with you and me, it's all good. - Yeah? - Yeah. I do think you should listen to your mom about that medical assistant job though. It pays more than minimum wage. It's a great job. Damn, Luke! - What, baby? - It was just gettin' good! What? Sk... Sky, where you goin'? Hey. Hey! - What? - You don't answer my phone calls. Why all the shade, Sky? The shade is that I spoke to your mother. - You didn't think I would find out? - I wasn't hiding anything. Look, it's gettin' busy in here, so you want somethin' or not? How 'bout you just come to the studio after you're done and let me explain everything, please. Look, I'll come by to your studio, but you better not be wasting my time. ♪ I just wanna Switch locations ♪ ♪ She said to me ♪ ♪ Come now, come now, baby ♪ ♪ Finish that drink ♪ ♪ She don't want No conversation ♪ ♪ Only want one thing ♪ ♪ And that's What's frustrating ♪ ♪ Heavy and deep ♪ ♪ She said she want to know She said she want to know ♪ ♪ Hey, hey ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ Since I can remember, my mom resented me for a bunch of reasons. I still don't know why. Maybe it's because when she threw my father out the house, she was forced to raise me alone. That didn't help her chances of becoming a dancer. We used to always fight. When I was 16 years old, I decided to quit school and get involved into the underground club scene. So, she decided to do tough love and said if I got kicked outta school, if I ever quit, I had to move out. So I did. Maybe I'm as stubborn as she is. I don't know if any of this is makin' sense. Trust me. I definitely feel where you coming from. The only hope in life my mom sees for me is drawing blood. And waste all your talent? That's crazy. Your mom said that you were using me to get back at her. She would say that. So when I told you I was with Pulsar, why didn't you just tell me then? I wanted you to get to know me first. I would've told you I was Jada's son, you would've looked at me differently. I guess. Whatever my mom tell you, know I'm not playin' games with you. I'm not lyin'. I'd like more, but as long as we can dance together, I'm good. Girl, you made Maya work for that one. I was just trying to keep up with her. I would not let it go to your head. And you know I was bein' easy on all y'all. I just don't want Miss J all up in my face. Okay. Anyways, some of us are goin' to the club tonight. You gonna come? Oh, my God. Y'all always goin' to the club. - Yeah. - Yeah, girl. All right. I'm in. - Hey, Tyrell. - Hey. Tyrell, this is my boyfriend Luke. Luke, Tyrell. - Nice meetin' you. - How do you know Skyler? Tyrell's her private dance teacher. I didn't know that you were taking private dance lessons. How you think she got this good? Obviously, I need to be over there taking lessons. Anytime. I just came over to say you look good on the dance floor tonight. Those dance lessons payin' off. Nice meetin' you. So, how long you been taking private lessons with this guy? - A few weeks. - Why wouldn't you tell me anything about that? Do I have to tell you everything that I'm doing? No, but if we're gonna have trust... You don't even want me dancin', so why do you care about what lessons I'm takin'? - Uh, Sis. - What? - The competition just got here. - Who are they? That's the crew we supposed to be goin' up against in Ultimate Dance World. - Wait, I know her. - You know who? Remember when I told you I got my ass whupped in that dance battle? - Yes, I do. - That's her. - You went up against Eva, Sky? - Yes. That's Atmasphere's best dancer. Well, well, well. - Hey, Eva. - Hey, girl. So, you didn't come to check out the competition? I mean, if we were, I guess we'd have to go home early, 'cause looks like I don't see any here. Yo, she funny. - Super funny. - I guess you ain't lost your sense of humor after we beat you for a... third time in a row. If you keep living in the past, the future's gonna sneak up and bite you in your little ass. Oh, this big ass right here? Your little... I don't see anything. - No, you see it.

I would've came earlier, but of course I had to listen to Mom's lecture. I think she tryin' to help. I don't think she's tryin' to hurt you. Yeah, whatever. She don't even think we gonna win now that we lost Maya. Girl, I hope she's not right. - Not you too. Come on. - I know. I'm just sayin'. Maya was the best dancer we had on this crew. I watched y'all go head-to-head, toe-to-toe. You can hold your own. - Hold my own like I could run this crew? - Yeah. And you don't have your eye on being Jada's number one? Look, I already told you. I'm cool with just being down with the crew. Bitch, you lyin'. All right, maybe it might've... it might've ran through my mind couple times. But I mean, who wouldn't want to do a solo? Shoot, I wanna do the solo, obviously. Yeah, obviously. but if you wanna do that solo, you gonna need to get that right. I'm not even gonna hold you up. Your hip was just going way too far forward. Okay, so you giving me tips? You know, I do what I can. Man, y'all are making us look bad, always showing up early. Like seriously, stop, okay? That's how they make you look bad. Oh, God. Man, whatever, Randy. You better watch your back, okay, bro? Ha. Hey. What's up with your sister? She's in some kind of mood today. Yeah, well, with the competition coming and no Maya, I think we're all a little stressed. - Right? - Maya was and is overrated. We can still win this, okay? - As long as Jada picks the right person for the solo. - You mean you? Why not? Although I hear somebody's been taking private lessons with Jada's son. He's just been showin' me some dance moves. Good for you. Men have been getting some on the side forever. I'm not getting anything on the side. - Seriously, I'm not. - Okay. Enough talk. Let's get to work, people. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. We're going again. Yeah, give me that attitude. Let me see it in your face. Yes! Hit this hard. Hit it hard. Up, down. Yes. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Not bad. It's not bad. Uh, why y'all all sucking wind like you about to take your last breath? Dance World is in two weeks, people. I don't want to see any gasping onstage. Tomorrow I am going to decide on who gets the solo. So come in prepared to show me what you got. All right, that's it. Get your lazy bones out of my studio. Is it just me, or is Miss J gettin' hard on us? Girl, it is not just you. She always gets like this when competition comes around. Girl, she is tryin' to win. We all just tryin' to win. Oh, I meant to tell you. I'm going to this underground battle at Lifted with Tyrell. You want to come? Is this another one of your, um, your not-a-date dates? - Forget I asked, Tosha. - Wait, I'm just playin'. You know I can't come. That dude I was telling you about who's always hooking me up with clothes? I gotta go Netflix and chill with him, act like I like his black ass. - -But first I'm hitting Zesto's with the crew, so... Well, have fun. Thank you. I love you. Love you too. Mmm, this shake is everything! Yeah, and this is coming from the guy who literally eats everything. - So, what's up, Tosh? - What? You, uh... You gonna let me get some clothes from your "friend" tonight? - From my "friend"? - Yeah, your friend. I don't think he will be cool with me getting another guy clothes, but if you need a crop top, sir, I'm your girl. Hey, Randy, that might be a good look for you. - Like for real. No shade. - I agree. - Hey, Tosha. What's up, guys? - Hey, Luke. - What's up? - What are y'all up to? - Chillin'. - French fries. - No practice today? - Eatin'. We finished practice about an hour ago. Oh. Where's Sky? Isn't she part of the crew now? That she is. But she's getting ready to go to that underground club thing tonight. Oh. She didn't mention anything to me. She said she was gonna ask you to go, but that's not really your scene, she says. Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true. I think she just decided to go with Tyrell instead. So they gonna go and try to see what's hot, check out some moves. Just her and Tyrell? I mean, we were all too tired from practice to go, but you know Sky. She gonna take this dance thing to the next level. Yeah, I know Sky. Um, you don't happen to know where that club's at, do you? Yeah, actually, I do. - You know, it's Lifted. - Mmm. Yeah, it's 409 Eighth Street. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Okay, cool. I'll catch up with you guys later then. - Yeah, sure. -Later, man. - Peace, man. Tell her I said not to come home too late, please? - Okay, I will. - Thank you. - See you, guys. - See you, man. - You threw that? - Threw what? - So you don't want the crop top then? - All right. ♪ Girl, your body movin' Like this your favorite song Whoo ♪ ♪ Know you with your girls But I can't leave you alone ♪ ♪ I don't know What's in your cup ♪ ♪ But you probably Need some more ♪ ♪ The way your body move I imagine what you do At home ♪ ♪ You got the juice, juice ♪ ♪ I tell the truth, truth ♪ ♪ You got the juice, juice ♪ ♪ I'm tryin' to, uh, uh ♪ ♪ You got the juice, juice I tell the truth, truth ♪ ♪ You got the juice, juice ♪ ♪ I wanna, uh, uh ♪ ♪ I can tell you liked it too ♪ ♪ Girl, it's not your fault How you carry it, uh ♪ ♪ How you manage that 'Cause the crowd goin' crazy ♪ ♪ Uh, lookin' as you like As want to be my lady ♪ ♪ Feel like Brady ♪ ♪ Feel like Jay-Z ♪ ♪ Stuff is runnin' Through my mind ♪ ♪ I'm goin' crazy ♪ ♪ You're the type of girl That my mama warned me 'bout ♪ ♪ But she don't understand ♪ ♪ When I bring you To the house ♪ ♪ Girl, your body movin' Like this your favorite song Whoo ♪ ♪ Know you with your girls But I can't leave you alone ♪ ♪ I don't know What's in your cup ♪ ♪ But you probably Need some more, whoo ♪ ♪ The way your body move I imagine what you do At home ♪ ♪ You got the juice, juice ♪ ♪ I tell the truth, truth ♪ ♪ You got the juice, juice ♪ ♪ I wanna, uh, uh ♪ ♪ I can tell that you a star ♪ ♪ Girl, you're shinin' bright Yeah ♪ ♪ You're the type of girl That make me hang it up And wait ♪ ♪ You and your money, girl ♪ ♪ I know you worth it ♪ ♪ Juice, Juice Trippin', trippin' ♪ ♪ Zippin', zippin' ♪ ♪ Got your own money, money ♪ ♪ Girl, you some kisser ♪ ♪ You got it, you got it You know you can dance ♪ ♪ Tell me what you think about This what I dreamed about ♪ ♪ Girl, your body movin' Like this your favorite song ♪ ♪ Know you with your girls But I can't leave you alone ♪ ♪ I don't know What's in your cup ♪ ♪ But you probably Need some more ♪ ♪ The way your body move I imagine what you do At home ♪ - ♪ I can't ♪ - ♪ You got the juice ♪ - Yo, that was so dope! - Great. - You're amazing. - What do you think you're doing? - Yo, you need to chill out, man. - Am I talking to you?

She's her own woman, and from the looks of it, she don't want you. - Just get outta here. - Let me tell ya something, you little broke-ass punk. I don't dance, but if you wanna step outside, I'll show you what a real battle is. All right, that's enough. - -You know what? That is enough. Come on. Let's go. - Are you coming or what? - You can't come up in here and drag me out like you own me. Know what, Sky? Enjoy your new life. Buh-bye! Look, I'm sorry about what happened at the club tonight, Sky. It's not your fault. So we cool? Yeah, we cool. - Damn! - What? Skyler, where have you been hiding these moves? - I gotta give it up to you. That's just dope. - What are you guys talking about? - Yeah. - You got it, flaunt it. Damn, you blowin' up all over the Web. Come on. 20,000 hits in two hours, Sky. - Who does that? - This is crazy. - Who posted it though? - Like, half the kids in the club. That was ill. - I was just following Tyrell. - Come on, girl. You schooled that boy. He's got nothing on you. Looks to me like Jada has her new soloist. I wouldn't be so sure. When she sees this video, she won't have a choice. Yeah, she's also gonna see I'm dancing with Tyrell. Miss J wants to win just as much as the rest of us. She's gonna come around fast enough. - Oh... - Did you see this? Oh, I knew y'all would be here celebrating. I'm not celebrating though. - I'd be if I were you. - It was just a dance battle. Your sister is dope. We all think she be dancing the solo. Y'all think Miss J gonna have somethin' to say about it? What are you gonna major in? Uh... Shit, I don't know. Politics, maybe? Politics? What do you know about politics? Hey, down there. Chill out. What about you? What are you gonna study? Uh, I always wanted to be an animal doctor. - "Animal doctor"? You mean, uh, a vet? - Yeah. - He means a vet. - Yes, a vet. Why not just be a human doctor? Probably takes just as long. I like animals better. That explains a lot. Right? Okay, whoa, man. I'm keeping this. - Hey, guys. - Good color. - Hey, what's up? - Hey, what's up? We were just talking about what we're gonna do when we win that scholarship. - 'Sup? - Okay. You all feel like we about to win this, huh? If you think about it and seen Skyler was goin' dong stupid in the club the other night. - I think we got a good chance. - I hope so. 'Cause I just want to be able to say that I'm a college graduate, you know? Okay, so what we doing here? We having a slumber party or dance rehearsal? What's goin'... We're just talking about winning that scholarship. Oh, well, I'm happy to see everybody's feeling so confident. Yeah, well, with Skyler doing the solo, we can't lose. What makes you think Skyler's doing the solo? - Didn't you see the video of her dancing? - As a matter of fact, I did. Which is why I am not putting her in the solo. Sorry, Skyler. You can't be serious though, right? It's my decision to make. So, yes, I am serious. I'm not trying to do the solo for me. Everybody who's seen the video of me dancin' says that I could beat Maya. I also saw the video, which is why I'm not giving you the solo. Wait. I'm... I'm confused. Okay, well, just because you can shake your booty you think you're a real dancer. But the kind of dance you do does not represent the style of dance that Honey Studio stands for. Okay. It's called hip-hop, and that's what I was doing. Okay. You can call what you do whatever you want. But I call it cheap exhibitionism, and your teammates will see that too once they have time to compare that to what we do here. - But I... - Ah. Dante, let's warm everybody up, huh? All right, guys. Spread out. - Sorry, Sky. - Miss J. - You just trying to get back at your son. - What? You don't want him to get any credit for everything he's been teaching me that you've never seen before. Let's leave Tyrell out of this. Right, 'cause leaving Tyrell out is easy for you, huh? What's that supposed to mean? It's supposed to mean putting your son out in the streets because he dropped out of school? - That's cold. - Whoa, Tyrell didn't drop out of school. He was kicked out for fighting and dealing drugs. And I didn't throw him on the street. The judge put him in a group home, and when he was released, he chose not to come back home. Not that I was in a hurry to have him back. You forgot your water... bottle. Has everything you told me been a lie? I want you to get to know me, Sky. Dealin' drugs? It was stupid. I got caught. I haven't done it in two years. You can't build a relationship based off of lies, Tyrell. Do you know what it's like to have nobody believe in you? That's been me my whole life. Do you know how badly I want somebody in my life to believe in me? Support my ambition? I believe in you. Look. I want somebody that I can trust.

Me and Skyler had something real. - But then you had to mess it up like always? - No. You did that to yourself by lying to her. - Why you hate me? - Is that what you really believe? Tyrell, I brought you into this world. I worked hard, passed on opportunities, to provide for you. So why don't you add that you resent me because of that? That's not true. And why you was never there to be a mom. Is it because I look like Pops? I bet when you wanted to throw him out, you wanted to throw me out too. When I met your father, I thought he was a good man. He had ambition and dreams. But when things didn't go his way, he started using drugs. When he couldn't afford those drugs, he started dealing. So, no, I was not gonna let my son be put in danger because of his choices. That's why I tossed him out. To protect you. But how was I supposed to know you was gonna end up in the same patch as your father? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Nah, you just tellin' me what I need to hear.

Please come on in. Thank you. I am sorry for stopping by unannounced. Oh, don't be silly. You're always welcome here. I'm sorry to say that Tosha's not here at the moment. You know, actually, I was hoping to talk to Skyler. Oh. Sure. She's in her room. I'll get her. - Skyler? - I heard the doorbell. Hi. What's goin' on? Well... Tyrell was right. I shouldn't punish you for what's going on between us. - He said that? - Yeah. He did. That's actually why I'm here. I want you to do the one-on-one battle. But-But I thought... Never mind what I said. I... I was wrong. So I'm asking you, will you be our soloist? I... The answer is no. Skyler's already applied to school so she could get her medical assistant's certificate and get a good-paying job. Wow, that was fast. Do you even have an interest in medicine, or is... Hey, Miss J. Hi, Tosha. Just stopped by to talk to Skyler. - What's goin' on? - She wants Skyler to dance the solo. Congratulations. I know I was harsh the other day, but... I've come to my senses. And so has Skyler. Are you sure about this? I promised her I would do it. I'm sorry you came all this way just to get an answer you weren't looking for, but I know my Skyler. And when she's made up her mind, that's that. Right, honey? Understood. Well, then I should be leaving. We are gonna miss you. If you change your mind, I have to decide on who's doing the solo by tomorrow. Sounds like she's already made up her mind. It was nice seeing you again, April. You have two very talented daughters. Thank you. Two. Well, that was mature of you. What was, Tosha? Turning down Miss J so you could do something practical. Yeah, that's me, Miss Practical. Well, it might've been a good decision, because I think she was coming over here because she felt guilty about what happened with Tyrell. Or maybe one of the reasons why she came over here is she felt like I was the better person for the solo. - You have to stop trying to compete with your sister. - Maybe so. I... Compete? Ain't no competition. You've clearly already picked the winner from jump. - What's that supposed to mean? - Look around here. You notice anything? How many pictures on the wall does Mom have of you? - I don't know. - Twenty. You wanna know how many of me? Three. And two of 'em, you're in. - Why are we doing this? - That's just nonsense. Nonsense? Really? Okay. I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm not here. Oh, and this one right here? I was actually standing right next to her, but for some reason, I didn't make the picture. Okay, now here we go with the dramatics. And that chip on your shoulder. You just really don't get it. Sky, Mom has worked hard all this time for both of us. It hasn't just been for me. It's always been easy for you, because you get the better end of the deal every single time. Don't blame me because I have talent, Sky. Wow. You've really got her brainwashed. You really got her brainwashed. And you really think I don't have talent. I didn't mean that, but... I know what you meant. Why share the limelight with your sister if you don't have to? - Okay. You know what? Stop. - That has... Stop. I'm not listening to anymore of this. You don't have to. 'Cause I made my decision. You answered Miss J, not me. What are you doing? Don't tear that up. You are throwing everything away. Cool. And where are you going now? To let Jada know that she has a solo dancer. How can you let that backstreet neophyte nobody represent us at Dance World? Girl, you better back it up. You are shouting in my face. I'm sorry. I just think you're making a mistake. Really? With Maya gone, we need our strongest dancer to go head-to-head with her in the battle, and that is not Skyler. So just who do you think it is, Nia? I'm not saying this for my sake, but for the whole team. It should be me. There's no doubt you are one of my best dancers, but Skyler brings something fresh, and we need that going up against Maya in the battle. She knows all our moves. It's your call. Well, good. I'm glad we at least agree on that. - I didn't mean for it to sound like that. - Uh-huh. If it's any consolation, I have added something to the routine that's gonna feature you and Tosha. - Really? - Yes, really. Huh. - Atmasphere, bring it in, bring it in. Bring it in. - Yes! That was dope. We are so close to winning Dance World. If you all can bring it like you did today, it's ours. Eva, the helicopter was fire. I want you to rock that in the solo. Yeah? - All right. I got you, Coach. - All right. Everybody, take five. When we get back, running the opening piece. Yeah? - Hey, Derrick, can I talk to you for a second? - Cool? - Yeah, yeah, of course. - Okay. So, you told Eva to do the helicopter in the solo. Oh, yeah. I think the helicopter works. I know it does. I'm the one who came up with the move. And you told me I was doin' the solo. What's up with that? I didn't mean for it to come out like that, okay? - I changed my mind, and I was gonna tell you... - Really? When? When it was too late for me to change my mind and go back to Pulsar? Why would you do that? We got a winning crew. The only reason why you have a chance of beating Pulsar is because I'm not on the team. Damn. That's the only reason why you recruited me, isn't it? What are you talking about? You never planned on giving me the solo. You just didn't want to have Eva have to go up against me. I would never do something like that. - I'm only doing what I think is best for this crew. - Really? I'm gonna do the same. I'm out of here, Derrick. Ladies. Fellas. Well, what a surprise. I got played. Really? Everybody, take five. Got played, huh? I should've never allowed Nia to talk me into going over to Atmasphere in the first place. It was her idea. Nia told me she begged you to stay. Begged? Are you kidding me? She's been on my case. On my case about how you be disrespecting me, telling me I need to man up and speak my mind, how I need to not hold my tongue. Well, damn, that sounds like the exact line she's been feeding me. It looks like we both got played. Clearly. So... does this mean that I'm back on the team? Eh. Miss J. - Of course. - Okay, yay. - But now, I have given the solo to Skyler. - No, no, it's totally fine. I just want to dance. For Pulsar. Come here. - Welcome back. - Thanks. Feels good to be home. Everybody, listen up. I am happy to announce that Maya is back on the team. Thank God. We missed you. - Does this mean she's doing the solo? - No. No, Skyler's still doing the solo, but I have made a slight change. I'm going to have Maya and Tosha do the breakout routine. - But that's my part. - Not anymore. - How can you do that? She wasn't even here... - Nia, don't. You have caused enough trouble for a lifetime, and if you think I haven't figured out that you've been playing us, then you're an even bigger fool than I was. Now step back in that line before I change my mind and give you what you really deserve. Mmm. Everybody, places from the top. Coming to you live from Atlanta for the 10th Annual USA Dance World Competition. Now, in just a few moments, this place will be overflowing with thousands of fans from far and wide for the competition. I see you ran back to your little crew. - More like I came home. - Mmm. I really hope I get to go up against you in that solo battle. Keep wishing. I'm not even doing a solo. Then who is? She is. I remember you. I whupped that ass in the club. And Jada wants you to go up against me? Is she tryin' to lose? - Bye, Eva. - Oh. - Good night. - Round two? See you later? - Bye. - You want it again? - Isn't camouflage a little last year? - I think that red isn't in. Nice outfits. Can't stand that bitch. Hey, don't let her get inside your head. We're good. We're good. Forget about them. Seriously. You know, it's not too late to back out now. - What is your problem? - Nia, go stretch. Seriously? Okay, people, hundreds of crews have competed for spots, but only 20 teams were chosen to compete in the sickest dance competition in the country. Y'all ready to battle? Let's go!
