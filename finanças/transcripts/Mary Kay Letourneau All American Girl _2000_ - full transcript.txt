(intense music) - My name is Cha Cha, I molested my five year old daughter. - Kenya Rogers, I hurt my kids. - What did you do to them? Say it. - I burned them with cigarettes and I penetrated them with objects. - [Narrator] Around, around, around we go. The past few days, that's all anybody wants to talk about is Mary Kay Letourneau. The phone lines are blazing off the hook, ladies and gentleman let's go to line one. Jessica, first up in the Q. Jessica, your opinion on this bizarre story of obsessive love. - [Jessica] This obsession of hers cost her her job, her marriage, her children. - [Narrator] All right, let's go to Joel and his car phone. Joel, if you've been following this story of this sixth grade teacher doing the nasty. - [Mom] A girl is never fully put together without lipstick and polish on her toes. - [Joel] That's every little guys dream in this world. What are you kidding me? Any, any guy, any guy out there would love that. - [Narrator] What about your son? What about if that were your son? - [Woman] She has a Jones with this one kid and they love her up. You know what? Eventually she's gonna get out and when she gets out she needs serious psychiatric counseling. - [Narrator] All right, let's go with Steve on line three. He so hard to trust. Steve, you're calling from a paid telephone? - [Steve] Yeah. And this teacher, she's already got three or four kids. She knows what it's all about. - [Narrator] I'd love to have the bird and the bees talk to me and have the experience of an older woman. - [Woman] As a teacher, I think it's absolutely outrageous. I cannot believe that she has had an affair and their two children with this student. I am appalled, I am absolutely appalled Chris. - [Jane] Tell it to me like a story. - No one understands. - [Jane] Make me understand. - October 10, 1995. - [Jane] What about it? - I died on that day. ♪ Oh happy day ♪ Oh happy day - Hello? Oh, hey grandma. How you doing? Mom, the phone's for you. Mom, it's Grandma Schmitz. - Hello? - [Grandma] I'm afraid that it's bad news. ♪ Oh happy day (razor buzzing) - What? - My father has prostate cancer. - Oh, people live a long time with that. - They gave him three months to two years. Steve? - What do you want me to do about it? - [Mary] I hear the sound of keys. Are they coming? I hate the sound of keys. - How did you feel when he said that? - He was just being his usual absent self. But something in me just let go and I knew there was no hope. - She's an unrepentant pedophile, Charles. We're going for the maximum sentence. - Mary was my neighbor, I know her. She's a good mom, she was a great teacher. Parents used to fight to get their kids into her class. - Then she had sex for eight months with a 13 year old boy resulting in a baby. - Susan, she needs help. - Mary Letourneau doesn't think she's done anything wrong. - Well, not in her present condition. But I was thinking, if we could get her onto this medication. - She refuses to participate in any sex offender programs. - I think she would, if we could just get her onto this medication. - [Susan] With all due respect Dr. Newhall, until she admits she's committed a crime I'm immovable. - Look, I think Mary is bipolar. I think she's got manic depressive tendencies. If we could get her onto this medication, Depakote, it would even out the highs and lows. It would stabilize her and bring her into her more reasonable self. - Right, jail won't medicate her. I mean, let's get this woman the help she needs. It's what we all want, for her to admit wrong doing and to get better, right? Susan, you're not trying to crucify her are you? (subtle piano music) - Thank you. (subtle piano music) (subtle piano music) (baby crying) - [Cha Cha] Letourneau come on what did you do? Girls or boys? - [Kenya] She raped a sixth grader. - It was not rape. - What would you call it? What did you do to your victim? - He's not my victim. - He is your victim. - Did you tell your kids yet that their mommy's a child molester? And that she may do them. Oh, I'm sorry didn't they mention that you had to tell them that? - [Cha Cha] Just a little boy with that smooth baby skin. Welcome to the program Mary Poppins. - I am not going back there. They're telling me that I have to tell my own children that I am a child molester and that I might be a danger to them. I am not a child molester. - [Jane] Legally, you are. Regardless of how he looks, regardless of how he sounds, Vili is 13 and the law doesn't care that it was consensual. - Okay, so if you find something mentally wrong with me does that excuse me from that group? - I'm sorry, no. You plead guilty and even if you get probation, you still gotta do that group for three years. - I should never have plead guilty. Those women hurt little children, their own little girls. - I know. - I'm not like them! - I know. - They're telling me that I will never be a mother again. - Okay, okay, okay, take a breath. You hear that your father has cancer. - I don't feel like talking anymore. - Okay. - I was losing my dad, I had a miscarriage, my marriage was a disaster. It was a very difficult time. (bell ringing) - [Jan] Hey Mary, morning. - Morning. - [Mary] Choose a painting that you like and try to imitate it as best that you can. Try to see what the artist was imagining when he or she was painting the original. Vili, will you please stop bothering her? - Why do you dress like that Mrs. Letourneau? - Excuse me? - You're so beautiful, you should try to dress a little sharper. - All right, Vili just concentrate on your work. - I'm done. - Well this is very good. Um, so does anyone know who the original artist was? - Joe Joe Keith. - That's right Christine. - Kinda got a double meaning don't it? - Vili, you're going to Mr. Jordan's office right now. Come on, let's go. Uh class please continue with your paintings and I will be right back. - I don't know where you buy your clothes. - What is wrong with my clothes? - Well they're pink for starters. Hey, I'm sorry I didn't mean, - You know you can't keep doing this Vili. Don't you understand that you're in trouble? - Your clothes are not that bad. - Just come to the office right now. - What's the matter? Breathe. - My father's dying. - I'm sorry. - [Mary] Goodnight, I love you. - I love you too. Goodnight mommy. - Sleep well. Hey little boy, hey sweet pea. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes Jesus loves me. Yes Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so. Night angel. I love you. (upbeat music) - [Boy] Hey Buddha, what's up with the slash on your tag? - Some girl getting the high heart. - [Boy] Buddha always gets the girl. (police siren) - [Police] All right guys, party's over. All right, what's going on? Who's responsible for this? - I was just lighting a cigarette and I threw the match down and, - [Police] And what? Come on. - Don't arrest me, my mom will kill me. - [Police] You gonna make the call? - [Police] Yeah, yeah, I'll call it in. - Buddha, you gotta get in earlier, it's a school night. Wouldn't it son? (subtle music) (subtle music) (birds chirping) - Look, have you seen that before? - [Vili] Where does the road go Mrs. Letourneau? - [Mary] I think it dead ends up ahead. - No, not this road. Our road. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) What are you doing up? - [Mary] I should be asking you that. I never go to sleep this early. - Yeah, me neither. - [Mary] My father is a brilliant, wise man with a huge heart. You know, he ran for President. - Of what? - United States, silly. - No way. - He was in Congress. He and I are a lot alike. Where's your father? - In prison. For putting some guy in a coma with his bare hands. I don't really know him, except he's a fighter. He and I are a lot alike too. - [Jan] Vili, shouldn't you be asleep right now? Go on back to your tent. Hey. - He has the most haunting eyes. - You're kidding right? - [Mary] He sees right into me. Like he knows all my thoughts and feelings. Like he knows everything I have ever thought. - Tell me a little bit about your father. He ran for President? - 72 election. - [Jane] That was um, Nixon and McGovern. - Hm. - And George Wallace. - [Mary] The American Independent party. After George Wallace was shot, my dad took his place. He got over a million votes. I worked on all his campaigns. - Well, I actually don't mind Mr. Nixon going to Red China, I just don't want him coming back. Well I uh, I didn't too badly for a Catholic John Burcher in front of a sea of Jewish arguably female faces, did I? Thank you! Thank you. - Mable, Mable strong and able, get your elbows off the table. - [John] Well I'm about finished. More Birdie Wine? Why is it called Birdie Wine? - [Kids] Because it's cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap. - [John] Okay boys, Red China go. - [Boy] Nixon's trip to Peking will stand as one of the great betrayals of history. - Sending soldiers to Vietnam while trading with China was killing them is, - Is a profound hypocrisy. The man's a strange creature, prone to making exceptions for himself. But he knows that there's a higher moral law. - Communists don't believe in God. - Sh. - [Petitioners] Racist Schmitz! Racist Schmitz! Racist Schmitz! Racist Schmitz! (patriotic music) Racist Schmitz! Racist Schmitz! - Cupcake, you're tougher than you look. - [Mary] My father was always the man in my life. - Nobody ever challenged him? Your husband, never? - No, no, never. Uh, not even close. No one could ever live up to my dad. Until Vili. (upbeat music) - I'm gonna get that teacher. - [Mary] That's for their doubting too. If you can wait and not be, - Everybody wants her, are you kidding me? - Every girl I asked never said no. - That's true man, but she's a teacher. - [Vili] I'll put 20 bucks on it. - All right. - All right. I'm gonna get her. (upbeat music) - [Announcer] We have an extra special guest today, Vili, Mr. Cock of the Watsu lab was sitting across from me. Child lover of the beautiful Mary Kay Letourneau, every boy's wet dream of a sixth grade teacher. Hey man. - [Vili] Hey. - [Announcer] Vili, one question. How'd she smell? - [Vili] Uh. - [Announcer] Did you do it for love? Did you get over one of those desks? - [Vili] Once when no one kids were around. - [Announcer] Beautiful. - He just says what people wanna hear, he makes up things, he's an artist. You have to understand that Vili is different. In second grade, I knew I had a prodigy. The only problem I had was to keep him focused. Okay everyone, science projects on your desk please. (bell rings) Okay have a great holiday! Goodbye! Merry Christmas, bye bye. See you when you get back! No science project? Where are you Vili? - The dark zone. - Remember in second grade how we used to get you out of that dark place? (upbeat piano music) - You have a piano at your house? - Yes. - Maybe I can come over some time, learn more songs. - I can teach you here. You have to finish your science project or you're gonna get an F. Finish this one thing, it's so important. You have so much potential, I see it so clearly. But you have to complete things. - [Jane] Were you aware of an attraction to him at this point? - Come on. Do you have any lip balm? - Yeah. - Thanks. They won't let me have lip balm in here for some reason. May I take a little for later? No, I wasn't attracted to him as anything other than a very talented student. I was proud of him, proud to help him. Thank you. - So he wasn't the man in your life yet? - Are you patronizing me? - No. Absolutely not. Let's talk about your school years. What kinds of schools did you go to? - Well, I went to about nine schools in 12 years. - [Mom] All right everyone, can you sit up please? All Catholic. - [Mom] We're going to say grace. Let's put our hands together please and bow your heads. - [Mary] There was no continuity in schools or friends, it was all family, only family. - We're going to move you to a different school after Easter break. - Why? - Pass the carrots please. - Why mom? - Sweetie, can you just trust that we know what's best for you? - [John] Why is there an epidemic of teenage pregnancies? Sex education. Ever since the implementation, - That's why we're transferring. They're starting sex education at our school. (intense music) - [Mary] It was no big deal, just unsupervised kids exploring. Eventually I said no and it stopped. - [Jane] After how long? - I don't know, maybe six or nine months. It had no effect on me. - [Jane] Did you tell your parents? - No, are you kidding? - [Jane] Did you tell anyone? - No. - Mary, I have to ask you this. Did you make this up to help your case? - How dare you? (knocking) She can't come in here. - She can if I say she can. - I don't have to talk to you. - It's true, you're paying me so you can talk or not talk. Whatever you feel like doing. - Yeah. Well no one wants to talk about what this is really about. - Which is? - Vili and I love each other. We are soulmates. He's ageless and so am I. God brought us together for a reason and nothing can keep us apart. - [Jane] Do you ever see yourself as sort of a rebel angel? - I pay you so I can fire you. - All right, okay. (sighs) Let me just ask you to think about something. Can you only enjoy sex when it's elicit? (whimsical music) - I got a question for you. How do you know if you're good? - Vili, that's not the right question. The question should be are you in love? If you're in love then it will be good and right and natural. - What do you think about an older woman being with a younger man? - What do you mean? - You feel right and natural to me. Why is that? Why do I feel like I know every little thing about you? - You know, I have the weirdest feeling like you're gonna be in my life for a very long time. Maybe you'll marry my daughter. - You're a runner aren't you? - Oh, I used to be. - Me too. - Really? - I'll race you to that tree. - Oh no, no. - Come on, come on. - Oh God! (whimsical music) (shouting) Oh my gosh! Ow, ow. (intense music) (intense piano music) (baby crying) (baby crying) (subtle piano music) (baby crying) (baby crying) (subtle piano music) - Hi. Hello. Mommy's here. (intense piano music) - Time's up Mr. Dunphy. - Okay. Mary, it's time. (subtle piano music) - Don't worry, I'll bring her back. - It's gonna be okay Mary. (subtle piano music) - [Soona] Okay, it's time for your bath little girl. Oh. (baby crying) - [Mary] Who has the moral right to separate me from my child? My children. - I'm sorry, there's no touching. - [John] Well women are above men, and they should be honored. The equal rights amendment will take away privileges, bringing them down to the level of men. My wife told me to say that. - [Man] Today, Mrs. Schmitz for the debate of the feminine position. - I disagree with everything you've just said. Women build power by using their womanhood, not by denying it. - [Woman] And are you telling me the majority of women, - You look strong. - Hm. - [Jane] So your mother is a rather un-emotional woman? - Does that thing always have to be on? - Let's ignore it. - She considers emotions a weakness. - [Jane] So how did she react when your little brother died? (subtle piano music) (water splashing) - [Mary] My brothers and I were playing in the pool. (intense music) All of a sudden, I heard my mother scream. (screaming) She found him at the bottom of the pool. I guess I always kind of blamed myself. But my father held me and said it wasn't my fault. When I was 19, my father had me represent him in a Ronald Reagan fundraiser in Los Angeles. I attended the private reception with just a few people and the Reagan's. I was having a remarkable life. I had decided to transfer from my party school to the University of Maryland. I finally knew exactly what I wanted and where I wanted to be. Washington DC, here I come. But I got pregnant by Steve Letourneau instead. I just don't love him! - Then how did you end up like this? - This boy is going to marry you. - Please no. - She can give it up for adoption. - I'll have the baby and then we'll see if it'll work out between me and Steve. - [John] There will be no crying baby in the vestibule at your wedding. - Daddy. - No Mary! We take responsibility for our actions in this family. - [Mary] I thought he was right, guiding me onto my life path. I knew I was sacrificing the kind of marriage we all look forward to. I tried to get an annulment but it's a lot harder than you think. Steve had a girlfriend and I was mostly sleeping on the couch. - And that was okay with you? You had no objection to that? - No, the couch was fine. - I mean the girlfriend? - No, I had emotionally separated from the marriage long before. And he didn't bug me for sex as often. Vili, I could sure use your help with the yearbook. - Working with you right? - Mrs. Letourneau, how's this? - Oh, it's wonderful. Thanks Christine. (intense music) - I think I'm in love with somebody. - Do I know her? - Yep. - Does she know you love her? - I think so. - Is she with someone else? - She's not happy with him. - Does she love you? - You tell me. She makes me feel good and right and natural. - I shouldn't have said what I said next. He had a way of crossing boundaries. I knew he would grow up, I would be out of my marriage. Can you hold onto that feeling for a very long time? - Good night Mrs. Letourneau. - Good night Vili. - Good night. That boy is so in love with you. - Oh, don't be silly Jan. - Night. Your books. - Thank you. (phone ringing) Hello? (subtle guitar music) - You hear that? - Yes. (subtle guitar music) - I'm holding onto that feeling. (subtle guitar music) - That looks good too huh? Okay, I'm gonna go get some more. Hey. You feeling all right hun? - Yeah. - Excuse me Mrs. Letourneau? It's time to go. - Oh please, we're on a yearbook deadline, it's very important. - Sorry, it's after 6:00. - All right, okay I guess I'll take this home with me. If any of you can come over this weekend to help me finish it, that would be great. - I can. - Oh, thank you Vili. - [Vili] So when he's making Faith, Lucifer cuts in and she doesn't get a full set of wings. She's missing a wing, so the boy, Cupid a warrior, has to fight the war to get her wing back and help put heaven in it's rightful place. - So Faith inspires Cupid, gives him courage? - Yeah. He needs her. - She needs him. - What's this? Are you missing a little something? - What? - Where is your wing? (intense piano music) You're so sexy when you're happy. I'm gonna miss you over the summer. - Oh. - Take this class with me. - No, this is for you. - You know what I want, I'm gonna make you all, - Hey, no you can't talk to me like that. - Why? Nobody can hear me but you. I don't wanna see no naked guys strip and I have to draw his penis. - It's fine, it's just a body. - [Vili] You gotta sign up, it'll be fun. You're an artist too you know? Come on Mary, do something wild for a change. - Okay, I'll be right back. - Aw man. So maybe next week I could draw you huh? You don't eat that. Here, like this. - You're getting it on your mouth. - How did I get it on my mouth? - This is part of your seduction plan right? - So, I get my kiss later? What would happen if I came over there and kissed you right now? - If I were you I would just do it. (intense music) (intense music) - Hi. - Hello. - Your sister told me where to find you. I'm sorry, but I need to talk to you. - You're always welcome here Mr. Dunphy. - Oh, thank you. Soona, we both know what Mary did was wrong, but do we think she deserves seven and a half years in prison for it? Do you think you could find it in your heart to say you believe she should be released? - Then I'd have to give you up. Hm. She never said she was sorry for what she done to my family. - No, uh I know that but she needs your help Soona. - She never said she was sorry. - We were best friends, always together. The sex wasn't that important. If you could see us together you would know that. - [Jane] What were you hoping or fearing would happen after the first kiss? - I thought we could be strong and wait. - Buddha! Buddha! (upbeat music) Buddha, get your ass out here. What's up with that? That's a teacher. - We're just kissing. Promise me man, don't say anything. Mom will kill me. - Hi Mary. - Hi. - How's Buddha's art class? - Oh, it's going really well. Do you need any help? - Oh, I got it thanks. Oh thanks son. - [Vili] Ma, I'm spending the night at Mrs. Letourneau's hanging out with Steven. - Oh Buddha, you bothered Mrs. Letourneau enough. - It's okay, right Mrs. Letourneau? - Oh sure. Steven's expecting him. - You're too good Mary. Thank you. - I don't understand. Did you call the phone company? - Yes, I called the phone company. - All right, well what did they say? - I told them that I ain't got no money, which is a fact we are broke. I said, "You can't get blood from a turnip." - That's what you said? - [Steve] Yes, that is what I said. We're broke, it's plain English. What are you talking about? - That's so dumb. You ask for an installment to pay for an installment. - Oh, give me a break! We are having a discussion here. Do not talk to me like I'm one of your students, okay? You know, I'm sick of this! I am so sick of this! (gasps) - You're the one that's having an affair! - Yeah, well who's fault is that? - Get away from me, you get away from me. - Who's fault is that? You've been asking me questions, I'm gonna ask you a few. Who's been too good to clean my house? Too good to sleep with me? (subtle music) (subtle music) (knocking) - Hi. That's my favorite kind. - I know. (intense music) - [Mary] Let's go. (upbeat music) - [Vili] When do you think you're gonna die? - I don't know. My grandmother lived till she was 102. Maybe I'll die at 102. - Then I'm gonna die at 81. - Oh Vili. - 'Cause I don't wanna live another day without you. (upbeat music) - Oh my god! (upbeat music) - Excuse me ma'am? Can you step out of there for a minute? Is there someone in there with you? - A friend of mine. - How old is he? - 18. - You're how old? - 13. - [Police] Yeah, hold on. - Soona. - Mary? What's wrong? - I had a fight with my husband and I uh, had to get out of the house. Vili came with me and, - Who's this lady to you? - My teacher. - Uh, I was driving around. I didn't know where to go, he fell asleep in the back seat and I parked the car and the police came and um, I'm gonna hand you back to the officer. - Okay. - Thank you. - Mrs. Letourneau is our friend. She's been very helpful in taking care of my son. - How do we write this out? (subtle music) (subtle music) ♪ I just can't fake ♪ To stay at home all by myself ♪ - What's the matter? Come over here. Come on, come on. - No Vili. - They're asleep. - I can't Vili. - Come on. - Vili, please. - Come on. - No. - Come on, I can't wait anymore. - Vili please. - I have to be with you. - Stop it. - [Vili] Why are you afraid? You think I'm gonna get you pregnant? - No, that's not it I can't have anymore kids. It's you, you're just barely, - You think I haven't done this before? Come on baby. You're so pretty, come on. I love you. - [Mary] Vili didn't force me. Up to a second before, I didn't think it would happen. - What triggered it then? - [Mary] I needed the relationship. So did he. - I need you. - [Jane] Did you ever have any sense that as the adult, you were in control? - No. Vili pursued me as a man pursues a woman. He has the dominant sexual urges and I gave into his needs. (bell ringing) Outside. This isn't your school anymore, you can't be here. - I can be anywhere I want, I wanna be with you. - You need to go to middle school and see what that's all about. I've gotta get out of this marriage the right way first and you need to experience being a teenager, have girlfriends your own age, you need to go play. - Listen to me, recess is over. - Mary, is everything okay? - Yes. - What's going on? - Nothing. - That kid is gonna be trouble for you. - Oh, you don't understand. - I think you're gonna have to do something about him. - Oh you know, he's so talented I just wanna help him. I don't wanna abandon him like everyone else in his life. - [Jan] Okay, just be careful okay? - [Mary] Okay, gotta get to class. - [Son] Mom! Mom! - [Vili] Pregnant? - Be right there! - [Vili] I don't get it, what do you mean pregnant? I thought you couldn't have any more kids. - I thought so. Which is why this is even more of a miracle. I'm making you a baby. - What about abortion? - I couldn't. This is you and me. - Oh man. Mary, Mary, Mary. Mary. - We're linked forever in this child. I'm not taking these. - For God's sake Mary, you're only way out of this is for something to be wrong with you. You plead guilty. - You made me plead guilty. - [Dunphy] The prosecution has left letters, they have a statement from Vili, a confession from you, they have a child with Vili's DNA and you wanna plead innocent? - [Jane] Mary, this little pill is a test, it's just a test. Let's see how you respond. - [Dunphy] It shows good faith with the court that you admit there's a problem and you're trying to fix it. - I am not bipolar. - [Dunphy] It's your only hope for probation and to see your kids again. - If I see my children again, I have to tell them I'm a sex offender. That's what pleading guilty has gotten me into. - [Dunphy] I'm gonna get you out of this and this is the only way. Now, I want you to make a statement to the judge apologizing. - Apologizing for what? Vili said I should have sex one more time with Steve to cover. - How long did that work? - A little while. - [Jane] Mary? - That was fun huh? - Yeah! Mommy, what happened? - You think I'm stupid? That I might think this baby is mine? - No. Hey kids, you wanna know what mommy's been doing with Vili? Huh, she's been playing house, it's right here in black and white! (shouting) (grunting) - Hello? Hello? We need help. (knocking) - Stop seeing her or I call the police and tell your mom. - Is that so? - She's my wife. - [Man] Buddha, it's for you! - She's mine forever, you get it? - I don't think so. - Buddha, come inside. - You better think again punk. - That was your teacher on the phone. She's on her way to the hospital. - I fractured my tailbone. But the baby's okay. I need a life and death promise from you. Not to ever, ever, no matter how someone questions you tell them about us, not even a kiss can be told. - I wouldn't. My spirit knows you Mary. The cross is where we meet and here's the blood we created, our baby. The heart is marriage and the thorns will turn to flowers and the light will be our life in heaven. - My brilliant boy. - [Man] A school teacher pregnant by a 13 year old. Hm. - I just wanna ask you a few questions. This won't take very long, I promise. You comfortable, do you need anything? You sure? What kind of relationship did you have with Mrs. Letourneau, Vili? It's okay, you won't get in any trouble. The boyfriend girlfriend type relationship? We already know Vili, we've got proof. - Of what? - A girlfriend boyfriend relationship. Has it gone any further than that? - Like what? - Did you have sex? It's all over Vili whether you talk or not. Just answer the question. Did you have sex with Mrs. Letourneau? - [Vili] Yeah. - Oh, hi Mr. Fletcher, you wanna see me? - Mrs. Mary Letourneau? - Yes. - I'm Detective Lynn Coughlin, King County Police. You're under arrest for rape of a child. (intense music) Come on. - I have children at home I have to call. - You can call from the precinct. - What about my job, can I work tomorrow? - I don't think so. I have information that you've been having sexual relations with Vili Fualaau. That the child you're carrying may be his. - What did Vili tell you? - How many times did you have sex with Mrs. Letourneau? - I wanna hear what you have to say. - What did Vili say? - Five, six. - When was the last time? - Last Friday night. - I understand there are written documents in your husband's possession implicating you had a relationship with Vili. Is the child you're carrying Vili's? - I think so. - And when was the first time? - Last summer. I kind of forced, she said no but we did it anyways. Did what? - Boyfriend and girlfriend thing. Had sex. - Now what do you mean, had sex? - A 13 year old child's baby? What's wrong with you? - Do you even know what that is? - You're a teacher who took an oath to protect children, to help them. How could you have sex with this student? - A penis going into a vagina? - Yeah, that's what that was. - I have two boys, one of them is starting school next year. Am I supposed to worry about him being molested by his elementary school teachers? Is that what you're telling me? - No! - Are you having sex with other students? Have you done this before? - No! No, no! Vili's different. He's special. I was helping, I was helping him with art and with school. And we became close. - How you feeling? - Nervous. - Do you wanna give a written statement? - I wanna do the right thing. I wanna do what's right for Vili. - She's my soulmate. - Soulmate? - I can't tell you what the right thing is. If you give a statement, it can be used against you in court. - I think I need a lawyer. - [Soona] That's what they said Buddha. Rape, a school teacher Buddha. Rape, hm? Did she rape you? Hm? Tell me! What have you been doing? Did she rape you Buddha? Did she rape you? What have you been doing? (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) Tell me Buddha! Tell me, rape! - Ma no! - Mary Catherine Letourneau, you are charged with rape of a child. Arraignment is set for August the seventh. You are not allowed contact with the victim or his family. You are not allowed unsupervised contact with minors, including your own children. - My children have nothing to do with this. - [Judge] You're further not allowed to reside with any children, including your own. - That's not possible. - [Judge] Should we lock you up, Mrs. Letourneau? - No your honor. She will comply. (intense music) - Come here sweetness. I want you to know that I love Vili and he loves me. I know some things I did are considered wrong. No please, you have to stay. I can't be alone with my children. (screaming) - I wanna kill that little bitch, Steven Letourneau for turning her in! Ass! And that cop calling me a child! And do I know what sex means, I'll give you a child bitch! She didn't rape me! If they wanna arrest somebody, they should arrest me! (screaming) I'm gonna kill myself for turning her in. - Don't say that. Don't say that. Everybody's gonna be okay. God will take care of all of us. (sobbing) (phone ringing) - Hello? Oh hi. Okay, when? I'll meet you there, bye. (subtle music) - I got one question Mary. Why? - I don't know, it just happened. I wish I could say. - You broke trust. (speaking Spanish) Mother to mother. You got kids, you know what I mean. I placed my son in your hands, you take care of him like you would your own son. You broke trust with me. What have you done to my family? - Mary, I never called the police. - You're a liar. - It was my cousin. - So if I sleep in the van, then I'm not residing with my children right? (subtle music) (subtle music) - If you could go back to the moment when things changed with Vili, would you take a different course? Would you do anything differently? - If I had turned away from Vili, I would die. Then what good would I be to my children? They need me. I know what it's like to need a parent. My father's love got me through my childhood. - [Man] Ex-representative John Schmitz is back in the news. It was revealed today that the far right politician, fathered two children outside of his marriage, with one of his students at Santa Anna college. The 30 year old student, - [Mary] I thought it was God's plan, that he changed my destiny, that I'd have to help raise those kids. - You accepted his behavior? - I understood it. - [Jane] Did he accept your situation with Vili? - Do you love him? Hm, hm. Does he love you? - Yes. - Well then everything is all right. If nothing else, or else you could do it politically. - Thank you daddy. - [John] Hello. - Look at this. Mary Kay, hire a cleaning lady if you don't have time to do this. They're not expensive. The two of you are quite a pair. May God in heaven have mercy on you. - Where are the kids? - [Mom] What you have done in God's eyes requires repentance and we think that you need to spend time alone to reflect on that. - Alone? What are you talking about? Wait, where are the kids? - We've talked to Steve and we've worked it out. - Wait. - That if you have this child and you give it up for adoption, that Steve will allow you to see these children again. - Allow me to see the children? He can't take my children. He can't steal my children! Where are they? Daddy. - Steve has taken them out of school. - What? - [Mom] And they're on a plane right now. We think it's better for them if they spend the time with us. - No, no daddy. Please daddy. - It's the only way sweetheart. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Look what I have for you. This is our daughter. Say hello, say hello to your daddy, Audrey. Say hello. Yes. Say hello. (subtle piano music) - [Vili] She's pretty huh mama? - [Soona] Aw, she's beautiful son. Will they let you keep her? - Child protective services will take her in 48 hours. - Not my first granddaughter. (phone ringing) Am I an acceptable guardian? (phone ringing) - [John] Hello? - Daddy hi. - [John] Mary. - Yeah, um I've been trying to call the kids for days. Why won't anyone answer the phone? - [John] Honey, Steve's taking them to Anchorage and your mother and I, - Yes, I know, I know you're not supposed to give out this information but my husband does work for the airline and they are my children. - Mommy! - Mommy! - I knew you would find us. - Oh, look at you. - Why can't you come with us? - Oh honey. I love you, I love you. Oh Jackie, hi my sweetie. Oh come here precious girl. Will you sing our song to Jackie? - I will mommy. - You will? - I love you. - I love you too so much. You be a good girl. You now I love Vili, but guess what? I love you more. - Really? - Really. - I'll miss you. - I'll miss you too so much. - [Jane] We're gonna ask you here if you think you did anything wrong. - The extra marital part was wrong. This person everyone calls a boy is more of a man than most men twice his age. If people knew the truth, if they knew how much we love each other. - [Dunphy] Yes, well unfortunately there's no exception to the statute that says it's okay to uh, rape children even if you love them. - [Mary] I never had a pager before. 911, I miss you desperately. - 104, I love you. - 187. - I wanna be with you. - [Jane] How do you think you will have affected Vili's life in the long run? - I hope he's learned from me that sex is best in the context of a loving relationship. - Your mother is here to see you. - I, I, I brought you a skirt and sweater. A good blue. - Where's daddy, why didn't he come? Is he all right? - He's all right. Don't get weepy. Your eyes will be red and swollen tomorrow. - What if I don't get probation? - Well that's why you have to look perfect. - Have you talked to the kids? - You need to do penance for your children, give up this latest child for adoption and you will be redeemed. - I can't. - Your hair is a problem. They wouldn't let me bring in rollers, so I had an idea. - Thank you. - [Rikki] This August, 35 year old Mary Kay Letourneau plead guilty to second degree child rape. - [Mom] A girl is never fully put together without lipstick and polish on her toes. - Do you have any lipstick I could borrow? - The victim, her former student is 13 years old. Well today, Mary Kay receives her sentence in King County Court in Washington state. Judge Linda Lau has two options, to force Letourneau into counseling or to send her to prison for up to seven years. - Mary Letourneau is an adult who sexually abused a boy, a sixth grade child. - She's on medication, she's more realistic now, she gets it your honor. - Your honor, Mary Letourneau inherited a gene for a condition known as bipolar disorder which is a biochemical imbalance, generally triggered by trauma. Postpartum depression is a particularly devastating time for women who suffer bipolarity and she sought her way out of this really unendurable despair in her relationship with this boy. She saw him as a man. She saw him as a hero, a savior, and she rocketed from depression to a state of a kind of exaltation where she felt invincible and able, in fact compelled, to take extraordinary risks, emotional risks, and sexual risks. - [Soona] Mary is not a bad person, she's just a human being that made a terrible mistake. I do not feel that there is a crime, my son does not feel victimized. Rape is when someone is forced. My son was not forced. He is not a victim. So I plead here today on behalf of Mary and the six minor children affected by this, including my granddaughter and my son, who feels unbearable guilt. Please, send Mary to treatment. I ask you to look deep into your hearts, jail will not benefit anyone and as God has forgiven me, it has as a society forgive Mary also, thank you. (intense music) - Your honor, I did something that I had no right to do morally or legally. It was wrong and I am sorry. I give you my word that it will not happen again. Please, please help me. Help me, help us all. - [Susan] We urge the court not to be side tracked by the bipolar smoke screen designed to confuse and obscure the real question. Can Mrs. Letourneau be trusted on probation when she has so abused the trust placed in her as a teacher, as a wife, as a mother, as an adult? - I am persuaded by the expert's opinions and the expressed wishes of the victim and his family that community based treatment is appropriate. Mrs. Letourneau, whether you stay out of prison now is completely in your hands. You shall serve six months in King County Jail with credit for time served, serve community placement for the maximum term, enroll in a three year sex offender's treatment program, continue psychiatric treatment including all medications prescribed, undergo periodic psychological evaluations and lie detection tests. You will have no contact with the victim. I caution you now, Mrs. Letourneau, violation in any degree will result in immediate reification of the suspended sentence and you will be remanded to the department of corrections for 89 months. (pager beeping) (intense music) (pager beeping) - Who's that? What do you need a pager for anyway? - So Soona can reach me about the baby. - Okay, let's not say anything to them all right? (overlapping conversation) - Honestly, I don't know how you could stand all this. - I don't mind, I can handle it. I grew up in the spotlight. - You like the spotlight? (subtle music) (phone ringing) - Steve, hi it's Mary. Are you there? Please pick up the phone. Kids, it's mommy please pick up. Are you there? Nikki, Mary Claire, Steven honey. Steve, tell the kids I love them. I love you all, I miss, (pager beeping) (whimsical music) (whimsical music) - I got you a present. - You look different. Tiny little wrinkles weren't there before. What? - Nothing. - I can't hack this. I need you with me. - We can't. Not yet. Don't forget your present. - [Vili] Let's go to Spain now. I'll take the baby, meet you there and we're gone before anybody has a clue. - Four other children need me, we can't run. We have to take responsibility. - I'm sick of responsibility. Let's go. - [Mary] Don't talk like this now. We have to stay on the upside, have an up life, okay? You're a father now, be a man. - Hey kiddo, why aren't you dressed yet? - Can I call my mom? - Uh no. Come on, let's get going. - Daddy. - [John] Statutory rape was a man's crime until Washington state passed it's ERA, which was rejected by the US making this a very political case. I was the leading opponent of the ERA, so I have to wonder if you're not getting payback from a liberal feminist judge, prosecutor, detective. - I'm gonna get custody of my kids. They have a sister and they're gonna know her. - Okay, I gotta go to work. He's gotta take care of his child. - [John] You're gonna have to prove rehabilitation. Get a job, find your own place, show yourself can be trustworthy again. You can do it. I know something about you, you're tougher than you look. - I wonder where I get that from. Are you Mary Kay Letourneau? And I said, "Excuse me, who?" And he said, "I'm sorry, nevermind." - Do you think it'll be a problem getting a job if people recognize you? - I don't think people will. My 15 minutes are over. (phone ringing) - Hello? Just a minute. - Who is it? Is it about my dad? - I don't think you should take this call. Vili, you can't call here. I'm sorry. - What did he say? - He said it was an emergency, that he'd been kicked out of school. I couldn't tell if he was exaggerating or not. - I'm going to the store. You need anything? - No thanks. (crickets chirping) (intense music) (knocking) - [Judge Lau] This case is not about a flawed system it is about an opportunity that you foolishly squandered. Your violations are extraordinarily outrageous and profoundly disturbing. The suspended sentence is hereby revoked and the original sentence that I imposed not long ago of 89 months is imposed. (baby crying) - See you later ma. - Bye son. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Steven? - Mom? - [Mary] Steven? - [Man] Well, I heard you talking about this thing with this teacher and man I, you know, I can't believe that there are people that are saying that the thing is right. - [Woman] Well as a teacher, I think it's absolutely outrageous. - [Man] Well how about your plan? The tying of tubes, preventing her from being pregnant again I mean, already two children she'll be delivering as a result of this. - [Woman] Well I agree, it's really bizarre and this poor woman, I think she is in desperate need. - [Man] This kid, what is he 13? And now he's got a kid, a baby that he's supposed to be helping take care of? - [Woman] I really feel that he will be terribly un compassionate towards this woman who's obviously in love. - [Man] Sort of consensual, I mean when you were a young guy didn't you sort of fantasize getting it on with your teacher? - [Man] That's every kid's dream, that's every little guy's dream in this world. What are you kidding me? - [Man] And then having sex with her. - [Man] This kid initiated the sexual relationship, they both said they were in love. This is not a victim aggressor relationship that you would normally associate with rape.
