I'd like to explain my odd behavior just now. - "Odd"? - When a man sits next to a strange woman in the cinema, who gives him her hand, on the shoulder, without discouraging him, and invites him home, the man imagines he has made an easy conquest. You won't believe me if I say it's the first time. I was very unhappy. It did me some good. Wait. You're a very unusual woman. I'm always a little afraid in the courtyard at night. The maid is with her family. For Christmas. All these books, wonder what they're for? "Books"? My husband is one of the finest printers in Paris. You're Italian? Yes. I look it? No. You sound it. It wasn't easy. What? My hand, in the cinema. I needed it. We both did. I like your accent. You live nearby? Yes. But I was away for a long time: 7 years I'm going back tonight. No? Yes.

There were complications. I had to stay away. Until tonight? Yes. And your employer's wife? She's dead too. What was her name? Why do you ask? Her name was Anna. Talk about festivities! No fun being a fireman. What's wrong? Can't you laugh? Where can we have a drink? Anywhere. What? You can't laugh either. My husband is cheating on me. He's with his mistress tonight.

Have you some water to rinse it? You insist? Yes. I insist. There's electricity, But no water. Is there a cafe nearby? I don't want to leave these. It's no big deal. Yes.

Not at all. I've had a nice evening. Merry Christmas. Robert. Please, come upstairs with me. Are you kidding me? No. Not at all. First, you don't want to, And now you do. What do you take me for? I'm asking you, come up. Christmas comes once a year. I don't want to spoil it. Watch your step. Oh sorry. No, no. She's asleep. She's a heavy sleeper. J?r?me, are you here? J?r?me?

I killed my employer's wife. So what? So I served 7 years. I got out yesterday. I'm not allowed in this area. They will never believe a suicide. He is your husband? Go away. Go away. - I tell you I saw you. You all set? The phone. I saw you. It's not l'?lys?e-Montmartre. No booth? No. I said I saw you. Where'd you see me? I saw you! I wasn't there! I saw your motorbike outside the door. Outside whose door? If your wife wan't there, I would have told you. You were talking on the sidewalk. - Let him talk! For God's sake, whose door? - You shut up! It's Christmas! Marthe, it's Robert. *Yes. Did you call them? *Leave me alone. Listen. I forgot to tell you: Don't touch anything. Do you hear me?

Nicole. - "Nicole" what? I don't know. "I don't know" She doesn't know her last name. My kids at her age, they would know. let's take her to Clichy. There might be some place closer. She's coming to. You gave us a scare. Nobody ever faints during Midnight Mass. Don't you want to see the doctor on duty? No. I'm alright now I just want to go home. Then tell me where you live. Better? Can you walk? Wait, I'll help you. Well, you're doing quite well. Really better? Oh yes. You've been very kind. Thank you. Men are useful, especially Will you have a drink? Really? I would like it.

If he sees you, he'll go away. Alright? How cute. Such a nice girl. Open the door. What a charming place. What will you have? Cognac, Chartreuse? Something strong. How about cognac? Yes. And you? Cognac. There. Thanks. I am Adolphe Ferry, car dealer in Levallois. Do you know it? Porte de Champerret. No. I deal in American cars. Give me a moment? The child. Quite a dish, eh? Her husband isn't around? I bet she's Italian. They talk about French girls, But the Italians aren't bad! 2 years ago, I vacationed in Italy. Well Not your type? I support the Common Market. The Treaty of Rome, I'm for that. What do you do? I was in Algeria. I see, and you've come back. She's not pregnant I suppose? Who? Well, fainting like that in the church... It's not easy to ask. Of course. A question of tact, in your line you need it Ladies like her, I see them everyday. American cars are quite easy to drive, In case of an accident, somebody else takes care of it. Nice line of work. Don't think it's all pleasure. Sometimes, the merchant gets taken for a ride. They're awful. They want everything for nothing. When I was a scrap-dealer in Aurillac You could sell those hicks any piece of junk. But in Paris, you can't get away with that. Some want to know if the paint-job is original. Outside Paris, it's easier. Quite true. Basically. Something wrong? No. Nothing. It's pretty. Ah, at Christmas, my son loved mechanical cars. 4 years ago, I gave him a nice one. I'm divorced. That's tough on the children. Is she asleep? No need to rock her? I could tell, She barely stood up. My purse. What? I left it in the church. Any money in it? Everything was in it. What a drag! We've got to go back there. I wouldn't want to I'll make it easy. Nobody is expecting me. And it was asked nicely. It's kind. Midnight Mass is long, They're all leaving at once now. Do you live nearby? Yes. Across the bridge. That's my route. Let's go. I won't ask you to come along. There. So long, Mr Herbin. If you're in need of a car, Think American. I'll get you a deal. Here is my card. Say, Look at that. Good night Give me a kiss! No. - To say goodbye, It's better. Leave me be. Wait. Come up for a drink? Good idea. We don't need champagne. Wait, I'll close the car door, and shut it off... Here, the door. There, it's closed. What a great idea to come up for a drink, because that champagne we just had, it wasn't very festive. Don't you think? If you say so. I'll tell you, champagne's nothing to me. I can't believe how dark it is in there. If Madame does not mind. - J?r?me? J?r?me, are you there? - Don't touch anything! Is it your husband? Hello? Hello? Damn it! Hello? Police? There's a dead man. Yes, dead! Yes. Impasse des Glycines, in Courbevoie. Mme Marthe, Mme Marthe. Please, what's the number here? Yes. Thanks. 7b, impasse des Glycines, in Courbevoie. How's that? Yes. A suicide. Really? Alright. We're in luck. The had a car on the bridge. They'll be here in a minute. - Have a guard at the gate. - Yes, sir. - You've got flashlights? Yes. - Find the light-switch. - Mme Dravet, Don't look at him like that. Don't look at him like that. - This way sir. This way. Go ahead. - He's in the living room. - When was he found? 5 minutes ago. - Were you with the lady? She was in bad shape. Dupuis, help the lady. - Mr. Ferry. Adolphe Ferry. I'm a car dealer. - Goodbye. Marthe! I want to die, I want to die I want to die, I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. I furnished this room just like the other one. The hardest part was to keep it from my husband. But he was never here. I hid the key. He never asked me for it. Yesterday at noon, I gave him a sleeping pill. Phenobarbital. It can't be traced. I watched him sleep all afternoon He looked so innocent, like he'd done nothing wrong. Later, I went out looking for someone. Me? You. No. It wasn't by chance. I had everything planned. Even the movie theater? Yes. That too. And then And then what? I removed the fuse from the light-timer. So you'd not notice which floor we went to. We came up here. Down below, he was sleeping. I gave you a drink. Down below as well. Yes. The music covered the gun-shot. Yes. When I later saw the blood stains, I just lost it. Hold on. And when you played the record? I went to put the kid to bed. I took the revolver and put it in J?r?me's hand. And I pulled the trigger. You heard nothing. No. You didn't notice we went up 2 floors instead of 3? No. You were kissing me. On purpose. I happened upon the only man who could not help me. So you went out looking for someone else. I had to. Ferry. Yes. Why did you stay outside for so long? Why? So it would be hard to determine time of death. La police arrived and found the body. The medical examiner. Will not find a thing. Nice work. What will you do now? What will you do now? How about you? I have to burn this furniture in the factory furnace. The police are coming back at 10 o'clock. What's the time now? 6:30. How are you going to burn the furniture? I'll break it down with an axe. Marthe. Marthe! Wake up, Marthe! My God Robert You really scared me. I fell asleep. I'm so exhausted. It's done. All finished. I even burned the axe handle. There is still the couch. What will we do? I'm not forcing you, Robert You understand? I didn't want you involved. You coudn't have done it alone. I'd have managed. Why did you kill him? He hurt me so much. He hated the little girl. I had her before we were married. He beat her. You've noticed how she almost never speaks? Sorry I slept. Alright. Now to the couch. I've got slipcovers. Give me a hand. There are hooks in back. Later, we'll push it into a corner. Goodbye, Marthe. Why did you do all this? 'Cause Italy's beautiful. Hello, Herbin. You alright? You've come back. What for? I've done nothing. You know a Mr. Ferry? He told me you were here. Let's go up and have drink. Your keys. Hello? *- Hello, Madame Dravet? It's Ferry. What? *You know, Ferry. I was with you last night. Yes. *The cops came looking for my auto registration? *- Auto registration? That is to say.... *Well? The first time I came over with the other guy... I slipped my wallet between the couch cushions, While he wasn't looking. Not very clever, But it was a reason to see you again. And I forgot to take it back. I couldn't have known. I need my registration before noon. Can you take a look? Yes. It's a black wallet. Hold on. It's here. So can I stop by? Yes. But not right now. In an hour. I was going out. Alright then. My sincere condolences, Madame. Thank you. You couldn't avoid committing this idiocy. What "idiocy"? Being helpful. Madame Dravet's husband committed suicide. So? There'll be an investigation. So, you're a witness. Since you broke parole, I've got to toss you in jail. It's Christmas. I haven't been back since my mother's death. It's your tough luck. When you're guilty, Don't pretend you're innocent. Let's see your papers. Your name's Ferry now? What? Adolphe Ferry, born 26 april 1919, in Perreux. That's you? I've never seen that. I didn't take it! I'll tell you why you wouldn't have taken it. Know what Ferry told us? His wallet, He stashed it in the couch, So he'd have to go back there. And now you've got it. It's not true! Shut up! You came back to the apartment. No. Oh yes. Oh yes. No. You went back. The situation was irresistable, an empty apartment. But it wasn't empty. Mr. Dravet came home. He surprised you. And you killed him. Not me. You put the revolver in his hand. Not me! No! - Robert. Robert. The wallet. Robert? In the couch, it was there. A wallet. Come in, Madame Dravet. As I undertand it, you have a lot of explaining to do. English translation by mackjay
