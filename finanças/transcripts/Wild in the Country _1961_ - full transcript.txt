Come on, Glenn. It don't hurt, does it? Come on, get up, man. Fight back! Get up, Glenn. Come on, boy. Come on, get up. Get up, Glenn. Most fortunate that the brother was not killed. Most fortunate. But there was intention on the prisoner's part. Deliberate and malicious intention. What happened, Tyler? Oversleep? Well, I weren't sure that today was the day, judge. I weren't sure. The parole board here... ...is coming to a decision about this boy of Yours. your wife's cousin, Braxton here, says he'll take him in and set him straight. - you got any opinion about that? - It won't help none. I've seen a might of trouble with him. He's as mean as they come. - He'll drink, fish and read books... - Comics? - I beg your pardon. - Does he read comic books? Books, but there never was a hoe or a plow that would fit his hand. - you're a damn liar. - I suggest you don't say much. Your record's not good enough for these remarks. Stole a car once, got picked up twice on a drunk charge. I don't care. He's still lying! I know why him and Hank raise that corn too. They drank my ma into an early grave with that corn. - Glenn, how old were you when she died? - Ma'am? She asked how old you were when your ma died. - Almost nine. - Well, let's get on with this. What's your recommendation, Phil? - I'd give him another chance, Tom. - So would I, judge. On parole, of course. Have him report once a week. I'll see to it that he stay at work with a living wage and board. I owe his ma, my own cousin, that much. He'll never do it, Rolfe. What he needs is correction. Mr. Tyler, what needs improving in your son? Well, begging your pardon, ma'am, what do you think don't? your picture's a mighty black one, Sam. There was nothing wrong with this boy back away. There was never a week that this boy and his mother didn't attend church. Now, Glenn, I want you to tell Judge Parker and the parole board... ...what was the master's cry from the cross? Eli, Eli, Lama sabachthani. And where in scripture, Glenn, is that noted? In Mathew 27:46, and sort of turned around in Mark 15:34. And what does ''Eli, Eli, Lama sabachthani'' mean? It means "My God! My God! Why hast thou forsaken me?" - Well, good luck, Glenn. - Thank you, sir. Hello, Rosie. I'm glad the boy was paroled into his uncle's custody. He'll have a chance. Tell me, was your sympathy for him real? - you're the expert. you tell me. - I know you share the same background. I identified with him. Isn't that the word? If you're not in a hurry, I'll buy you a drink. Not today, Phil. - Irene, is it really never again? - Now, we both agreed to that. No, you agreed. I merely went along. I'm sorry I did. There aren't many times a man is given distinction. - Back to your law office, Mr. Macy. - All right, Mrs. Sperry. Well, here we are. It don't look like much, but we serve a community need. Here's your new home, boy. Got these bottles all ready for labeling. Here's one that's a little short. Now, watch this, boy. That's good stuff. Got to give them all a square measure. Now, they're all set to go. Now suppose it's, well, Johnson and Terry. They order under their own label. That's Shenandoah Elixir. This one. Now, mine's Old Seminole Tonic, sold in every state in Dixie. Salem Drugs will order under their own label too. - And it's all the same stuff? - Except for the labels and the color. 87% aqua pura, 13% grain alcohol. Some folks won't want no label at all. They walk in off the street and buy a few at a time. Well, that's it, boy, from A to Z. - Are these the ones to be shipped? - Yep, here's the keys to the truck. you'll be comfortable in here, Glenn. I had it fixed up for you. It's clean, it's dry, it's healthy. Even got your own private entrance. More than I had when I was your age. I plan to put you in a shower too, right over Yonder. I do love the smell of this place. Dry cardboard, alcohol and herbs. Also money, it just rolls in. That's a good smell too, boy. - About my pay, is it okay to ask? - Pa, supper's ready. Fine, Nory. Hope you made plenty. Got an appetite in the house now. Come and get it, Glenn. Before she throws it out. Excuse me. Mighty nice chandelier. Set me back a pretty penny. Cheap at the price. - Sit down, Glenn. - All right. Yeah, nice chandelier. I bought it off the Johnson place. - It's Baroque Renaissance style. Yeah, it's mighty nice. Always spend money with a purpose. you'll find my advice is worth heeding. you know, you got good Braxton blood in you. I aim to see you get ahead. About my pay, Uncle Rolfe... For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly grateful. - My pay? - your pay? 1 o a week and keeps. Did I say 10$, 2.50 is more like it. I want you happy, boy. We got a pleasant little family here, and I want to keep it that way. Yess. Glenn? Glenn? - Betty Lee. - Hello. - Didn't expect to see you around. - I drove in with Ma for a meeting. - We hoped you'd be up for supper. - your kin don't like me. - Not true. Ma thinks you're nice. - It's your pa. - Is that Nory's baby? - It isn't a cat. - Did you see him? What's he like? - What's a baby like, Betty Lee? - Glenn, don't be mean. - Why are you asking so many questions? - I'm sorry, I hadn't thought. - They got me on parole. I got to go see this parole officer once a week in the courthouse. I got to get examined by Miss Sperry, caseworker, psychiatrist, whatever. - She thinks I'm a lunatic. - Irene Sperry? - She spoke at school about her work? - That's the one. - Her mother left her that house. - She thinks I'm dumb. you know what I think? She looks like a walnut... - ...and she'll get cracked. - My mother thinks she's nice. - Dig that. your ma thinks she's nice. - Yes, Glenn, don't look for trouble. - Ma thinks you're nice too. - you didn't show her my letters? - No. - And the other stuff? - Why? - I want that junk back, maybe burn it. Sometimes I think you're touched myself. Don't you trust anybody? She's pretty. Pretty and sad. When's her husband coming back? They don't know. He's in government work overseas, so Rolfe says. When did she marry him? No one in town seems to know. - They don't say, and I don't ask. - Yes, but... Don't worry your heart, Betty Lee. Just let it be. - Don't worry, she won't bite. - She's the only one that won't. Come on. - Where would you want me? - In here, please. - Any place you want me to sit? - Anywhere you like. What about right there? All right, now what? I think we should get one thing straight. I'm not a policeman. you were just appointed by the court to find out if I'm touched or not. - Where'd you pick up that impression? - The hearing. you were taking all those notes, counting every flea on me. Those might have been about your father, mother... - You don't know about my ma. - I'd like to if you'll tell me. I don't care to tell you, and that's that. - She meant a great deal to you. - You heard me, didn't you? You can leave. There are no bars on these windows. - You smoke? - No. This routine of Yours would stagger a billy goat. What's funny? - What you said. - It wasn't meant to be. you want to find out what makes me tick, don't you? No. you're a complicated human being, not a cheap tin clock. Now, you can stay or leave as you choose. Well? - You invited me to leave. - Right. If you keep pretending you're slow-witted, I'll put you out. - You're pretty tough, huh? - Well, I can be. Why don't we get down to business? I might be able to help you. Well, I'm not exactly drowning. What kind of help? How do I know? All I know about you is what I have in this report. - No, that's mine. - Can I see it? No. What it says... ...would stagger a billy goat. I see you can smile too. I'd like to apologize, ma'am, for being so hostile. - That's the word, isn't it? - You didn't invent hostility. - What do you want me to talk about? - Anything at all, just talk. It'll never leave this room. Do you believe me? I think I do. Yes, ma'am. I'm always walking around with a full cup of anger, trying not to spill it. When somebody hurts me, I want to hurt them right back. I've laid awake nights wishing my pa and my brother was dead. Hank didn't die, but I tried to kill him. I got the mark of Cain on me, ma'am. I know where I'll end up, and not you or anyone else can stop it. What are you thinking, Glenn? About the dreams I used to have. Money... ...fame. Is that what you want? I could have bought my ma her freedom with money and fame. Bought? I don't quite follow that. Listen, ma'am, my ma was enslaved on our farm. And I do mean enslaved. Many times I've seen her out in the hot sun chopping cotton... ...while them two men laid up drunk and wasted. She done meals, she done the chores that Hank wouldn't do and I couldn't. Then that lady... ...and she was a lady, ma'am... ...she'd soak her old stockings in buttermilk... ...and put them on her arms, not to burn, and go work in the sun... ...while Pa's fishing the river with a jug by his rump. Now, my point, ma'am... My point is... ...I'd have bought Ma away from there if I'd had the cash. I'd have brought her into town. And give her a house like this on a quiet street. And set her on the porch in a rocking chair... ...and let her watch the seasons come and go. From springtime till snow, she could relish it all. White lilacs... ...early rhubarb... That's the quiet sort of thing she liked. She could read too. She could read fine books. But there was never the time. "This is undone, and that's undone." And, "Glenn, where's my mind going nowadays?" She said I'd go to college too. Now, there's a laugh. She was bugged on learning, ma'am. And then... ...just before my 9th birthday... ...she died and left me. Death... ...he's a quick one, isn't he? Did you want to go to college, Glenn? If you don't mind, ma'am, my heart's out of it, and I'll leave. - Could I come back another time? - Well, of course. Monday around noon? Yes, ma'am. It's quitting time, Glenn. Saturday night. Here's your pay. There you are. Well, what's on your mind? High junks? Too tired, unseasonable weather. - When are you going to put that shower? - Until I do, use the bath upstairs. - Could I? - I should say you can. Any boy works the way you do deserves the best. you know, Glenn, I knew you wasn't lazy. There's too much snap in the eyes, huh? - What's to eat? - Fried chicken. I do aim to please. One day you'll find a man, and he'll say, ''your pa trained you right. " Yeah. - Glenn, now what's this? - I told Glenn to use the tub. Does he get to use my toothbrush too? Don't leave no rings around that tub. I got enough chores to do. What's eating on you? you asking to be chastised? - Stop picking on me. - Don't you see he's a godsend? - He's a decent boy. - A decent Tyler? - Never seen you with his folks. - He's a good, decent boy- That good, decent boy has been hay-lofting with Betty Lee Parsons. - So people say. - you going to listen to me! Lay off! I'll be gone like my ma if you don't quit. That is an eventuality which will not eventuate, Nory. you aren't got the guts. you just wait and see. This beer's good. - Enough hot water in there, Glenn? - Yeah, thanks, Uncle Rolfe. - Now, there's a boy full of thanks. - Pa? - Stupid and full of thanks. - Only I'm not stupid. No, you're a Braxton. you're not. - Stop biting your nails. - I wasn't. What time is it, Pa? - Time? 9:50. - No need to fret. He'll be here. There he is. - Got a truck, huh? - More than you had at his age. Now listen... - Evening. - Evening, I'm sorry I'm late. I couldn't get shed of Uncle Rolfe. I almost went to bed. Too late for the movie. - They'll be open at High Tension Grove. - You two fight it out or just sit. Love's a surrounding and entertainment all by itself. - BY the way, it is love, isn't it? - Mother! Well, don't just sit! We'll never get away. - Don't be mad, Betty Lee. -1 o:oo. Do you want to hear some music? you're going to hear it whether you like it or not. Look, I told you Uncle Rolfe wanted me to take Nory to the picture. I was embarrassed. Then I had to ask him to lend me this truck. - It was all for... - There's no reason to shout. I look at you and wham I'm head over heels I guess that love is a banana peel I feel so bad and yet I'm feeling so well I slipped, I stumbled, I fell One crazy kiss and bam I head for the skies I guess that love is like a cake of ice you skate along But then you never can tell I slipped, I stumbled, I fell I never thought I'd get kicked By your sweet talk and lies you got a bag of tricks And when you got busy I got dazzled and dizzy I felt like a ton of bricks My knees are weak My head is spinning around I guess that love Has turned me upside down Thought I'd get hurt But gee, it's turning out swell I slipped, I stumbled, I fell - I don't like this place, Cliff. - It's the only place open this late. Dace, go ask him to join us for a drink. Betty Lee, Cliff Macy wants you and Glenn to have a drink with him. Tell him we got a drink. I've always hated Cliff Macy after what he did to you. Hate's like a snake biting its own tail. - What's he got against you? - You, for one. It seems his father's money couldn't help him there. I never thought he'd go so far as to lend a car, and then say I stole it. But it figures. I feel sorry for him sometimes. - I won't waste any sympathy on him. - Maybe sympathy's never wasted. One way or another, you get it back. Or so it says in the Book. - That's something I can't understand. - What's that? The way it says we ought to be, and the way we are in fact. Turn this cheek, that cheek. Don't cast the first stone. That's for tall angels, not for men. - No, I don't see any wings on you. - Now, that is a fact. Hello, Betty Lee, Glenn Tyler, how you all doing? We were doing fine till you crawled in. - Crawled, dear boy? - Yeah, crawled, as an insect. - Don't you go calling us no insect. - Shut up, Dace. Tyler, I invited you and your lady companion for a drink. My date, Monica George, expressed desire to meet you. - you're stoned out of your mind. - Don't. you're supposed to be on- Lady's reminding you you're on parole... ...and my distinguished father is a member of that board. Let's all calm down and have a drink. Set them up. Don't think I'm forgetting Christmas night. Let's go. - Wait. - Take your hands off. One side, ladies. I want to continue my conversation with Tyler, the auto thief. You put a black mark on me I didn't deserve. The next time you and Dace come for me, I'll crack both your heads. Glenn, come on! We going to have to mess him up. Mess him up good. Hey, Tyler! How's your cousin Nory and her family increase? Hey, Tyler! Thank you, Sarah. So go on. He Yelled something at me as I was leaving, but I didn't pay attention. What's wrong with him? He likes to tell the world he's had his tail kicked. Nobody wants him, I guess. Maybe his folks done it to him. - But the Macy's are well-off. - Yes, I know. Money's no guarantee of a normal childhood. - Tell someone else that, Miss Sperry. - Mrs. Sperry. - Excuse me. - I'm telling it to you. Think the two of you might have something in common? Not as I can see. Well, you've kind of had your tail kicked too. I'll have to chew on that a while. you know... ...a couple of Years back I decided to keep a diary. - Just like a girl or something. - Diaries can be very productive. Did you ever think of writing in a serious way? What makes you ask that, ma'am? you turn a phrase a certain way, an image. - You could write, you know? - I'd rather read. What do you read? Comics! I almost passed out when you asked my pa if I read comics. I got so mad, I could've thrown you through the door. They could've put me in jail. "Who's he?" "Nobody, he reads comics and sucks a jug." you're not being fair. I didn't know you then. Well, you made me small that day. - Do you read very much? - Some. - Don't you want to talk about it? - It makes me nervous to talk about it. You see, I was helping at home, and I was late getting out of high school. So being a Year behind and a head taller didn't help any either. Every once in a while, I'd mention about how I wanted to write. you'd think I set a blowtorch to the American flag. What's a man for if he can't aim high? - But... - But you gave up. I guess. Well, I guess I better be on my way. I got some more deliveries to make. Glenn, what do you think of this idea? The thing that happened at High Tension Grove... ...write it all down in your own words just as you told it to me. - I can try it. - Yes. - Is there a certain time you want it? - No, whenever it's finished. I have to thank you, ma'am, for an awful lot. No, you don't, Glenn. Not Yet. Rose! Come on, girl. Time for your walk. - Hello, Flossie. - Hello, Mrs. Sperry. - Admiring your handiwork, are you? - No, something new and very nice. - A pleasure to see you, Mrs. Sperry. - Thank you, Davis, it's mutual. - Have you taken your bar exam Yet? - No, not until the fall. Come more often. I've been noticing Mr. Macy works too hard. you notice too much, Davis. I think he's right. I do work too hard. Let's relax. - I'll try a martini. - I'll try one too. I don't think I ever make a martini without thinking about us. Did you ask me here to discuss us? No, but make hay while the sun shines. That's what my old dad used to say. - Very dry. - Very dry. Irene, I think you're just as lonely as you ever were. I know I am. Here's to loneliness. If I let my wife divorce me, I'd lose all this. I'm just the steward of the plants and mills her father left her. But I'd gladly give it all up if you'll marry me. Not that we'd starve, you understand. Do you realize what you're saying? Of course. I'll get a divorce if you'll marry me. I can't be any clearer. you're saying if I decide, you'll get a divorce. You won't decide. You'll leave it up to me. That's not right. It's as though you were using me. Using you? That's what it boils down to. To pry Yourself out of an impossible situation. You're not being honest with yourself. You're just afraid. Your first marriage... I don't want to discuss that. Well, think about it, will you? Bring that fine analytical mind of yours to bear on your own problems. - Physician heal thyself? - That's the general idea. You're asking the impossible. Phil, why did you invite me here? I wanted to talk about my son, Cliff. - May we discuss him for a moment? - Of course. It's his mother. you know she's as loose-footed as ever. She's spoiled the boy. She's got him heading down the same road as herself. Only in his case, it might be a fatal road. Fatal? How? No one knows this but his mother and me. Cliff has what's known as an athletic heart. Too much of everything too fast. I've taken him twice to specialists. But in spite of it, he's drinking like a fish. Running wild, in fact. - Would you try to straighten him out? - That wouldn't be wise. - Because of us, you mean? - Exactly. I'd have to talk about his mother and his father. How objective and honest do you think I could be? Not very, I guess. I will look into it and see if I can find someone good. Thanks. I suppose I'm just looking for some way to try to bring us together again. I'm sorry, Phil. I really am. That's about the size of it. you know, I snapped my fingers and up goes a new factory. And it doesn't mean a thing. Goodbye, Irene. Bye. Where's it been this late? It took Uncle Rolfe to the bowling alley. Friends driving him back? Old Seminole. Your pa's going to whip your tail. That stuff would pickle a snake. What ever happened to that old Mexican guitar your mother had? It's been a long time since she gave us both lessons. She was a good singer. Hank stepped on that guitar on purpose. He's a mean one, almost as mean as you are. All you think about is Yourself. I like to mind my own business. Well, then go on, go to bed and mind your own business. Move your little fat legs. I wish your pa'd put that shower in. It's hot. - He won't put that shower in. - Why won't he? Pa hopes to catch us one of these nights. you and me, together in sin. That's his plans. Then you'll have to marry me. What about your husband, Nory? you are stupid. Cost Pa 2 bucks, that did. I may not be here tomorrow But I'm close beside you today So lie to me a little Say you love me a lot And I'll be true to you In my way Love never goes on forever At least, that's what wise men all say So smile when you kiss me Tomorrow you may cry But I'll be true to you In my way Yes, I'll be true to you In my way - I'm going to bed. - Don't go. Pa won't be back till 1:00. - Don't bait me. you'll get in trouble. - I won't tell a word, I promise. I want to get out of here. I want to have a good time. - Then do it. Run away. - It needs a man to go to hell with. That's what I want, hours and hours of heaven... ...that slides down to hell, and we don't care how or when it ends. you're wild, Glenn, just like me. Unhappy wild. Pa's got some money stashed around. He hides it like a squirrel. We could take some and run away. Nobody would know. I can't run away. I got plans. - Mrs. Sperry... - I want you, Glenn. And I mean want. Since we waded in Felcher's Creek. - I was only 12... - You waded a lot since then. I wanted you even then. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. Just ask and see. That why you treated me like dirt all these Years? You think I'm no good, don't you? No, honey. - Who's that? - Dace. Turn those lights off. State liquor store's closed. Cliff wants to get some of Braxton's stuff. Sell it to them. Pa usually does. Why don't your boss-man come get it himself? I'm right here, Tyler. Sorry to interrupt such a charming domestic scene. Two bottles, dear boy. When you coming out of deep freeze, Nory? Why, I'm a married lady now. Call me Mrs. Martin. Bless your black little heart! Don't married folks get lonely too? you offend old friends by your protracted absence. Don't rusticate too long, my dear. - I can't make change. - You keep Yourself that change. Maybe you'll buy yourself some cuff links or such. Someday you may even own a shirt. Someday I may stuff it down your throat, dear boy. Give that to your pa. Good night... ...Mrs. Martin. Good night. Ma'am? Well. - The grammar and spelling are bad. - Pretty bad. - Are the characters here real people? - Yes, ma'am. I do kind of mix them up, though, don't I? I guess you should know right away... ...if people belong up with the angels or down in the fire and brimstone. Should you? Take, for instance, Betty Lee. At times I look at her and I think she's flat, dried-up and selfish. And then again, I think she's warm and full and unselfish. What about this character, Nory? She wasn't at the Grove, I wrote her in. That's a writer's privilege. I even get mixed up about Nory too. She says that she'll have me any way. Plain, fried or scrambled. And I am tempted at times... ...like at night when Uncle Rolfe's at the poker games. I don't know about Nory. In fact... ...proper folks would say she's just downright no good. What would you say? Well, you know me, ma'am. I'm not proper folks. Nory never had a chance. Her ma ran out on Uncle Rolfe... ...five or six Years ago, and he's taken it out on Nory ever since. But she got around him. One time she got lost over the weekend with this New York-type salesman. He came through in this big, new, shiny car. I pretend like I don't know, but I know. That baby's father has a big, green convertible. And that's the way it is. I don't like to sound like I'm bragging. But it's like I have two girls with two roads to go. you know what I mean? Yes, I know what you mean. Have you ever thought there might be a third road? What's that, ma'am? What your mother wanted for you. College. - What makes you say that? - This does. your story. Have you any idea how good this is? How much promise it shows? Do you mean that? you said the grammar and the spelling was bad. Spelling and grammar, that can be taught... ...but this has something that can't be taught. It has such beauty and power and excitement it jumps off the page! All you need is discipline, formal education. No matter how, you've got to go to college. - It takes money to go to college. - There's such things as scholarships. Look, let me make a suggestion. Take this home and rewrite it. Polish it up. I'll show it to a friend at the university... Let a lot of people read it? Strangers? Well, of course. I didn't write that for anybody else to read. Just you and me. Then you want to be an errand boy all your life? Or slop hogs on some farm? you said you wanted to be a writer. Be one. - Suppose you're wrong and they laugh? - You take that chance. Where are your guts? - I'm an ignorant country boy. - Stop boasting. I don't know about all this, being a writer and going to college! - What are you trying to do to me? - Wake you up! On the parole board's orders? you were supposed to help me, not rile me up like a muddy creek! Twist my life into something you want. Not me, ma'am, not me! It seems to me you're overstepping. - I had no idea... - I'm sorry, ma'am. I had no right to put harsh words on you. Will you at least consider what I've said until we meet next Friday? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Something's burning. Smells. I hope that girl's watching dinner! - You ever want to fly? - No. Kind of breezy up there. Yes. Here, hold this. Feel that pull! - Whoop! - Whoop! you like me? L- O-V-E you. Back to the house. Get off this property, kite and all! - Don't be mad. - I'm sorry if you think... I'm not concerned what you think. Get back to your folks. - You're all a lot of pigs. - Daddy, stop! Don't answer back! you didn't come to church! Go and help your ma! No child of mine gets taught ungodly things on the Sabbath! you could find more godliness here in the sun than in your church! Don't you come here again! I'll not have it. Where is God? I don't know. He takes a boy like my son off in the war... ...and leaves a loafer and braggart like you alive. Glenn. Glenn! You been touching my stock in any shape or way? - You think I need a tonic? - Think it's Glenn? I don't know. - How are things between you and him? - It takes two to waltz. Besides, he don't mean dust to me. - Did you get it fixed? - No, I gave up. - You were going to fix it... - I gave it up. According to my count, there's considerable stock missing. Know anything of its whereabouts? No, except for the two bottles Cliff Macy bought. - Suppose Nory's been tippling? - I wouldn't know, Uncle Rolfe. - Well, I'm on my way. - Why do you leave the safe door open? So if anyone wants to thieve, he'll see there's nothing to be thieved! Cute, am not I? I'll be home around 1 or 2. Poker night. Lock me up, son. Thanks for not telling Pa. What's in that stuff that makes it smell like that? Banana oil. That's a joke. It's no joke. Banana oil. - Is there enough hot water? - Mm-hm. Will you shut that door? I want it open. I said, I want that door shut! - I'm sorry. - Turn off the light. Oh, Mrs. Sperry! Mrs. Sperry! I want my story back, please. Mrs. Sperry! Didn't that light go off? I did see a light, didn't I? No, you dreamed it, hon. - No, I didn't dreamed it, hon. - You did. Well, I want it back. I want my story back, Mrs. Sperry! - It's that Tyler boy, stoned. - Stoned is an understatement. Mrs. Sperry? Mrs. Sperry! Well, what do you know? - I want you to meet Mrs. Sperry. - I don't want to meet Mrs. Sperry. We're going to wake up the whole neighborhood! It's too hot, anyway. - Is it too hot? - Yes. Well, we'll cool it off a little bit. What are you doing, Glenn? I'm going to hose away the heat. Mrs. Sperry! What about it, Irene Sperry? Gimme the hose. I wonder if this porch stuff is rainproof. Come on, let's go. Let her sleep. What's he doing now? Hosing down the porch. - Come on! - All right. I have no desire to monopolize your time, ma'am. She don't give a damn about me, anyway. Let her snooze her life away, I don't care. - Come on. - Goodbye, Mrs. Sperry. - Come on. - No, wait. I want to cool off. Wait a minute. This is cool. - Give me some. - Sure. No, no, no! Oh, you! Glenn! Hello, Glenn. Ma'am. Have you been working hard? What does it look like? You said you wanted your story back. Here it is. I'm sorry about last night, ma'am. But I don't want to come to those meetings anymore. Well, that's your privilege, but I'd like to know why. Let's just say I'm not worth it. I'm not worth it! - I disagree with you. - What am I talking to, the door? Everything goes in one ear and out the other. you mean there's no brain in your head to stop it? Surely you realize you're gifted. I don't care to be gifted. It's too much work. Gifted people get knocked around. I been knocked around enough. If we were all afraid, there would be no great men. We would have no scholars, scientists, artists or movers and shakers! Get this. This ought to be good. What's that ''movers and shakers'' routine, ma'am? Those who overcome handicaps, who live to move and shake the world. Shake it out of its alligator sleep and move people out of the swamps. - She means like Jesus, Glenn. - Yes! I mean like Jesus, Glenn. Flings them words around like hash. - Why did she come here? - Where's your ears? I don't need ears to know what she wants from you. - Get your mind out of the gutter. - It just goes right back down again. It's sure a beauty. Least a man can do for his only child on her birthday. - Glenn... - Nory, you look pretty as a bride. Well, thank you, Pa. Since Pa got me a new guitar, I'm giving you my old one. Come on, you kids. It's a big night, and it's all on me. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. Folks born in July, they're home-loving, they say. Come on, now. - I'm glad to see you, Mr. Braxton. - Evening, Reverend. - A dollar's worth for me. - A dollar? Thank you very much. You go enjoy Yourselves. I'll catch up. Step up, boy! Oh, too bad. Don't go away mad! Two for a nickel. - How you doing? - Thank you. All right, let's see. - Supposed to knock them off. - Next time. Stick around. - Too bad, let's go. - Oh, no. - You win a big doll here! - Thank you! Step right up, folks! How about you? Just one more! - Can I, please? - Sure. Lord is good to give us a night like this. - Evening, Mr. Baker. - Evening. Well, there's a thing. He saves used postage stamps, all the way back to Confederate days. - A couple of grape drinks, please. - Yes, sir. Poor kid. Being her birthday, I've been holding it back all day. - I don't know how to break it to her. - Holding back what? News about Nory's husband passing away. What's your plans, Glenn? If you don't mind my saying so, you're jumping like a cricket. No, I'm as continuous as beads on a string. Now, if you and Nory came together, I'd make you a partner in my place. you know the business. I'd give this thing a decent time of grief. That's a point. If I could soften the blow, which it's sure to be to Nory... ...by telling her you got matrimony on your mind. How did he die? That's the funny part. The telegram don't say. - All that hush-hush government stuff. - Yeah, I've seen a lot of it on TV. - Are you hinting that this is fiction? - I'm saying don't box me in. you listen to me! you are boxed in, that's gospel, but not by me. You took Nory like a stamp. Licked, smacked and canceled her all over. - you deny it? - I wasn't exactly alone. - Are you saying you...? - you had this in your mind all along. - you ratty liar! - Don't say that! Wait till the parole board hears about this! Where's that boy? Get him! - What happened? - He pushed me down! Call the police. Are you hurt, Mr. Braxton? I ache bad. I ache very bad! I came because I had a fight with my uncle. Broke parole. He'll say I stole his truck. They'll take his word... ...and I'll go to jail for 2 or 3 Years. All I can do now is run, get out of the state. I'd just as soon get out of the world too. I'm that anguished. Take a trip to the moon or hang Yourself? Which? How you exaggerate things! Don't you get it? I need sympathy, not sermons. You can't build on sympathy, it has no bones. Now, instead of spluttering like a wet firecracker, what do you want from me? Betty Lee, I don't have the right to ask. It's Nory. It's a trick. Her pa says I must marry... I don't want to hear it. Be honest another time. I'm sorry for Nory. For you too. I'm sorry for myself that I love you, Glenn. It won't stop. And you're wild and unsettled, like a porcupine that can't be held. That's right. I'll never make a pet. - Can you scrape up $20 to help me? - Yes, but they'll get you. That's my risk. I won't hurt or bother you again. - I never said you hurt me. - Will you get me the money? Don't you think it might be better to stay and fight for your rights? How? - Come in and we'll phone. - Who? Mrs. Sperry for a start. Come on. Myself and two others on the board feel you're being harsh with the boy. - Dr. Underwood and... - Yeah? Who's the other? - Mrs. Sperry's working with Glenn. - That's neither here nor there. His morals make my blood run cold. And he stole my truck. - And I need x-rays! - Then you mean to press charges? - I do. - I'd rather you didn't, Mr. Braxton. you look here. Don't come in here trying to blackmail me! Blackmail is an ugly word. But let's explore the possibilities. A recently widowed client of mine, I advised her to drop the case. you sold her hundreds of dollars' worth of tobacco juice called Bermuda Balm. You claimed it was a cure for cancer. you can't prove that. Can't I? Crooked transactions should always be in cash. She's got her canceled checks and a witness, her cook. Life's got shadows enough, Braxton. Live and let live. Your truck will be returned tomorrow. I'm glad you got beat, Pa. You don't peddle me like your no-account belly wash. Glenn! I was just typing up the bills, Mr. Longstreet. Grease me up. I'm going to the Athens for a bite. Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't see you. I brought your guitar. - Is your pa still mad at me? - Mad's a kind word for what he feels. - You don't hold it against me, do you? - Of course not, Nory. You warned me. - you always told me the truth. - I can't lie to you, can't pretend. Glenn, I've missed you something awful. Don't I get to see you anymore? I don't think it would do either of us any good. Do me good, for sure. you remember what you said about us being wild? Unhappy wild? you need somebody who's more settled. Someone with their feet on the ground. Me, I don't know what I need. - But- - But it isn't me! - I didn't say that, Nory. - I can get along not being needed. I just need you, Glenn. - I don't mean marriage. I'm not good- - That's your pa's words! - That's not his words! - Don't let him beat your wings down! you aim to fly way up above me. But if you ever come tumbling down... ...I can wait. goodbye, Glenn. - Is Mrs. Sperry home? - She'll be here in a minute. you can sit and wait if you like. Not in there, in the living room. I'm waxing the study floor. Don't break anything. Hello, Mrs. Sperry. Glenn. - How nice to see you. - Thank you. - Been out to the penitentiary again? - Yes. It's been one of those long mornings. - How's your new job working out? - Just fine. - I wrote Mr. Macy to thank him. - Oh, good. - Lunch? - I had it, thanks. - Sarah doesn't approve of you. - Yeah, I know. She likes to hose down the porch herself. What's this? It's the story, ma'am. I rewrote it like you asked me to. Oh, I'm very pleased. All these things that are Yours... I can see a whole life in them. - You read French, ma'am? - Yes, I read French. And what are these, your father's old medical books? Do you think this is art? Yes, I think that's art. If you say so. This play program... Who is Paul Sperry, ma'am? He was my husband. Was? He died. Well, I'm sorry. You've never spoken about him, ma'am. No, I never do. Is that good? I mean, keeping something inside that should be let out in the air? You learn very fast, don't you, Glenn? you don't need books to understand you should never lock up a heart. I'd like to have known him, the kind of man you'd marry. Well, he was just a boy. Very talented... ...very emotional. Like you. Were you happy? Well, you'll learn, in spite of the fairy tales, there are other things... ...besides living happily ever after. Like what? Like work. One's self-respect. I guess everyone that knows you respects you. Well, thank you, Glenn. - Come back on Friday, like we used to? - Yes, of course. We're almost there. you excited? - A little. And you? - Yes. Come on, Glenn. - American literature. - All this?! Yes, three stacks over. There's Hemingway, Twain, Melville. you take your pick. After my class, I'll be in Professor Larsen's office around the corner. - Glenn, are you listening to me? - Oh, Yeah. Right around the corner. ''Dace sniffs in twos. Sniff, sniff. But sometimes sniffs in threes and fours. Sniff, sniff, sniff! Walking, wet or dry, head cocked like a spaniel, aiming to please... ...little Dace sniffs. Does a rabbit know about its twitchy nose? Does the cricket hear its chirp? Like that, Dace doesn't know he sniffs. Dace is dead. He's brown and leather dead like the pork meat from the smokehouse. Sniffs, worms, smoke and all... ...may God hang him high like a flitch of bacon in the winter wind." I wish I'd written that. You've got a real natural on your hands. - Then you agree with me. - Oh, I'd say! Given time and seasoning, anything might happen. His contact with paper is immediate and instant. He writes as he feels. I'll try and work a scholarship for him. Send him in. Glenn? - You'll never regret this, Joe. - I hope not. But don't get too involved. Great expectations, great disappointments. This is Professor Larsen. Glenn Tyler. - How do you do, sir? - How do you do? I want to say just one thing, Mr. Tyler. May I? Yes, sir. For man to discover fire was nothing. To learn to use and control it was everything. Will you think about that and what it means? Yes, sir. I will. If you were taking my course... ...I would be tempted to give this piece of Yours an A. That's all. Run along now. I have to bone up on a lecture. Thank you so much, Joe. Good to see you. Bye-bye. Goodbye. We're marching across the green grass Green grass, green grass We're marching across the green grass In a husky, dusty day We're marching off to get married Married, married We're marching off to get married This husky, dusty day You're awful dirty and ragged Ragged, ragged you're awful dirty and ragged This husky, dusty day I'm just as good as you are you are, you are I'm just as good as you are This husky, dusty day I'll climb through your window Window, window I'll climb through your window This husky, dusty day I'll lock and bar the window Window, window - I'll lock and bar the window - I think you're off the key now I know and I just can 't help it you need some new tires, Mrs. Sperry. You're riding on your nerves now. - Maybe I should take it for a while. - All right. - Want to stop until it blows over? - That's a good idea. - Well, where did you folks come from? - We dropped out of the sky. - Got any coffee? - No, never touch the stuff. What have you got? Well, I got lemon and cherry pop and ice cream on a stick. - I'll have cherry pop, please. - Yeah, me too. - Do you think this rain will last? - Lady, where's your ears? It's coming down mighty steady. Looks to me like it's going to rain all night. There you are. - Thanks. - Thank you very much. He's probably right. Want to wait in the office? - It'll be warmer. - Let's. - You two want a room? - No, thanks. - Got anything good to read? - Zane Grey. Can't none of them beat Zane. He came here once, after... ...the first World War. Autographed me two of his books. Why don't we take rooms until the rain stops? I'm tired and jumpy. Sure, ma'am. If you like. - You register right here, ma'am. - Shall I sign for you, Glenn? - If you don't mind. - Two rooms. - Two rooms. - Are the rooms heated? Yes, ma'am. Heater in every room. 15 and 16 adjoining. This way. - Okay to take these? - Yes. Just help Yourself. This way, ma'am. - For the lady. - Thank you. Okay. I'll see you when the rain's over, Mrs. Sperry. Here you are. - How much you get for this? - $6.00 single. - You mean for one night each? - What's wrong with that? - In summer you pay $8.00. - I'll sleep in the car. Hold it. What did you figure to pay? - Three or four. - Then why don't you do it now? - You'll do it later. - What? - Double up for $8.00. - Wait! All right, two singles for $8.00. Glenn? Come in. Glenn, I think we ought to try to drive home. It's not a good idea on those tires. Wouldn't be safe even in daylight. Something wrong? It's just the rain. I haven't been able to sleep. Any of these any good? The Gideon Bible, it's always good. Try Genesis, seventh chapter. What's that? And it came to pass after seven days... ...the waters of the flood were upon the earth. Well, maybe we should build ourselves an ark. I'll wait for you here. Don't worry, Mrs. Smith, they know me. Everything with a kiss. Oh! Well, Mr. Smith, it's nice to see you again, sir. - Got a room? - Yes, sir. Hey, now. I see you got a couple of other customers tonight, huh? Yes, we have. Number 11, your old room. For luck. Thanks. - What's so funny? - It's a small world. Yes, indeed. A very small world. I'll borrow this, if I may. - Good night. - Good night. Ma'am? It wasn't the rain that kept me awake, it was you. These walls are thin, you know. - I'll try to be more quiet. - No, it's not that. I guess you know what's happening to me. Glenn, in a relationship like ours... ...well, this kind of thing often happens. - Psychiatry calls it transference. - That's book talk. I don't mean to be disrespectful to you, but I'm in love with you. Irene... I'm in love with you. Do you want me to leave? Please. Well, no matter how many times- Well, I can't help it if she's not home when you call. The Tyler boy. All right. Will you tell her again, please? I've got to see her. It's very important. Yes, I'll leave the message. Miss Irene, that boy sounds very troubled. It's the third time he's called. Here's to us. I'm assuming your wife is still willing to give you a divorce. Honey, don't worry. you know she'd jump at the chance. In one stroke, you've given my life real meaning. - I have to say something else. - What else is there? You're going to marry me. I don't... I don't quite know how to put this... I'm marrYing you for mixed reasons. Well... We're neither of us school kids. I'm running away from something... ...something I'm afraid of. Another man. - Anyone I know? - That's unimportant. It's just that I wanted you to know... ...and I've been terribly frightened. I've felt myself on the brink. Darling, everything you're saying is unimportant. I know you'll be a wonderful wife. We'll be happy. We'll be happy, I guarantee it. We'll have to celebrate at dinner tonight. Mr. Lewis again, calling from Chicago. It's urgent. I'll take it. I'll make you a martini. Yes, speaking. Oh, very dry. No, no. Not you, Mr. Lewis. I'm sorry. - Afternoon, Mr. Longstreet. - Hello, Mr. Braxton. Young Tyler around? I just sent him over to the hardware store. - Is there something you wanted? - He stole my Nory's guitar. He don't impress me at all as a boy with itchy fingers. From what I heard, I'd check him elsewhere along the line. What's that supposed to mean? - Who told you that? - My nephew, Willy Dace. A laugh! It's half past 7. How long will he be? I don't know. I'd like to go home myself. Nice to see you, son. Ma'am. you can go in now, Cliff. Good evening, Dad. Craving a boon, I wonder if you're in a good mood or bad. - Where were you Friday night? - Friday night? - Stopped somewhere in the rain. Why? - you and Willy spreading a story... ...about Mrs. Sperry up at some motel? I told a friend or two... - Do you realize what you've done? - What have I done? They were there together, all night! Don't get excited. Sure, you're hot for the lady Yourself. You'd throw my mother away to marry her. It's time you knew you're not the only one who carries a key to that door. Can I see Mrs. Sperry? Or is her car home, and she isn't? - She's home and expecting somebody. - Never mind. Ask him to come in. Won't you sit down? I'm sorry, I was planning to call you tomorrow. - I know I owe you an explanation. - I haven't slept for two nights. I've put it off because it's been complicated. - I love you. - It isn't that simple! - you worried about what people say? - No, it's not that. - I don't care what people say. - Would you listen? Sit down. All right, I'll listen. You're at the start of a brilliant career. You mustn't get tied down. You've got to have your hands... - ...mind and emotions free. - What's that got to do with us? You're simply not ready for a marriage. This is all about me. What about you, Irene? It wouldn't work for me either. For once, what about your life? I love you. I got the idea that you love me too. Can we talk about that? Let's talk about that. I know a lot about love. I married for love. Do you know how it ended? It ended by my husband getting in the car one rainy night... ...and hitting a curb at 90 miles an hour. And do you know what killed him? Love! - I don't understand. - A marriage he wasn't ready for. - you blame yourself? - Yes! I should've known he couldn't carry the responsibility. Glenn, do you see I'm letting the same thing happen all over again? I wanted so much for you, and now I've nearly ruined it. I let my hopes get mixed in something that doesn't belong... - ...that doesn't belong at all. - It could if you let it. - It could! - Oh, Glenn, please! Irene. Are you telling me you don't love me? Answer me. Answer me, please, Irene. His uncle says you spent Friday together in a motel. - Who says? - Is it true? - Who told him that? - My son. - He's an expert in shady motels. - In lies. I'm not so sure about that now. Is he what you're running away from? - you got no right to talk like that. - Haven't I? Mrs. Sperry has said she will be my wife. Phil, don't! Irene, my son, what he said, is it true? If I find him... If he's shipped home in a box, don't say I didn't warn you. you were right, ma'am. I don't ever want to see you again. Glenn! Glenn! Irene, I have to know. Is it true? No. Are you in love with this boy? Yes. Now maybe I've destroyed him. Nory. - What are you doing here? - Where's your pa? - He went bowling tonight. - Do you want to shake this town? you wouldn't fool around with me, would you? Where's the money your pa's got stashed away? Here it is. It's got a fake bottom. Just bust it open. - Get packed, and get your baby. - I'll be ready in a shake. Well, how do I look? Kind of frisky for a widow. Glenn, it's a dream. It's a real dream. Maybe it's a nightmare. How do you know? We better take the back roads. They'll be after us. - They won't. Pa can't do a thing. - What do you mean? - That's all tax-dodge money we took! - It is? I would give my eyeteeth to see his face when he reads that note! - What are we stopping here for? - I'll be back in a minute. Hang on. - you seen Cliff Macy? - He's inside. If it isn't Tyler, the great lover. - Is that Lady Sperry? - Don't talk about her. Don't talk about her! She's a pushover. Ask my father, ask anybody! - Is he drunk? - Get water, will you? Quick! It was a fight. What did Cliff Macy do? It doesn't matter anymore. It's all over now. State police. Your pa called them after all. - You Glenn Tyler? - Yes. I'm taking you in for manslaughter. Look at them, crowding in for the free show. You'd think it was a circus... ...not a coroner's inquest. What was a boy like that doing with a $500 watch? you have nothing to blame Yourself for, Mr. Macy. A 20-Year-old boy? Mr. Macy, it's nearly 2:00. Phil? Phil, can I speak to you for a moment? Go home and pull down your blinds. you must listen. Glenn had no intention to... Get him a good lawyer, because my intention is to hang him if I can. Phil? Mrs. Sperry? I'm Hank Tyler, Glenn's brother. We was wondering if... We got a jug in the car. If you know a good motel... ...we figured we might all get together. There she is. - Any more questions? - Was there any sort of weapon? Might have been. It was getting dark. There was no medical evidence of that. Thank you. you can go. Quiet, please. Quiet. It's been suggested, and she's agreed. Will Mrs. Sperry come forward to testify? - She's got a lot of nerve! - We must have quiet here. Quiet! Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - State your name, please. - Irene Sperry. - Mrs. Sperry... ...we're simply trying to determine if there are grounds for prosecution. MAN 1: Kills the boy, and wonders if there's grounds for prosecution! I wish to remind everyone here that this is an inquest... ...and not a murder trial! Was Tyler present at your house on Thursday night around 8:00? He was. - What was he doing there? - Social work! - Was Phil Macy present? - He was. Did Tyler at that time... ...utter some kind of threat against Mr. Macy's son? - Well, he... - What did he say? I don't remember the exact words, Dr. Creston. Was his remark something along the line: "He would send Young Macy home in a box"? - Yes, Mrs. Sperry? - He had every reason to be angry. There was a slander being spread, a lie. - True! - You denying it? - Some lie! - Yes, a lie! Glenn did nothing to be ashamed of. If anyone's to blame, it's me. I lost sight of certain realities... ...and I forgot my responsibilities. Oh, Glenn, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Mrs. Sperry, this is off the point. We're merely trying to determine if there's been felony committed here. What I'm trying to say is that there was no felony committed. - Cliff Macy's death was an accident. - What do you mean? Order! Order! Glenn was angry over what had been said, and he hit him. He didn't intend to kill him. - He didn't know Cliff had a bad heart. - A bad heart, Mrs. Sperry? Yes. Isn't that in the autopsy report? There was postmortem evidence that he'd suffered a coronary. We assumed it was caused by the blow. Are you saying the boy had a chronic heart condition? Well, if so, the family physician, Dr. McLaws, knew nothing about it. Well, ask his father, Mr. Macy. He told me about Cliff's heart weeks ago. Well, Phil... ...do you wish to make a statement? you needn't. We realize it's painful for you, but... There was nothing wrong with my son's heart. He was in perfect health. We will hear the next witness, Hank Tyler. Raise your right hand. you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth... - ...so help you God? - I do. - State your name. HA-K: Hank Tyler. - Sarah. - Yes, Miss Irene? Here it is. Make sure it goes first class, special delivery. I hope they don't get too drastic with that boy. Do I take the car? Car? Just down to the post office? Sarah, you'll grow fat. I suppose. No, Rosie. No walk today. Were you present at Mrs. Sperry's home... ...when Tyler is alleged to have made a threat against your son? - I was. - Can you repeat what he said? He said: "If I find your son... If he's shipped home in a box, don't say I didn't warn you." - No! - We'd better adjourn now. No, wait. Give me a minute, please. I want to, God help me, correct a statement of mine. - What happened? - I lied to you about Cliff's heart. It was bad, very bad. It wasn't Tyler's fault at all. I struck Cliff myself the same night for the same reason. Let him go! Let him go! Irene. You can switch over. - Irene? - That's the idea. Keep breathing. Breathe deep. Irene, there's nothing to be afraid of anymore. Mr. Macy told them the truth. I'm free. But I need you, Irene. Don't leave me. Don't you leave me too. I'm so ashamed. Don't be ashamed. I'll help you. I'll take care of you. I won't let anything hurt you again. - Well, Glenn- - I'm not saying goodbye. I know, but find out first. Be sure. That's what college is for, is to find out. Will you write? All aboard! Subtitles by SD? Media Group [ENGL?SH SDH]
