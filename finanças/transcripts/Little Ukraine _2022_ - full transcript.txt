Look at me. When we go inside, you just listen to your cousin. Mm-hmm. 'Cause you'll be the boss one day. What's wrong? Those people? Those people are waiting for us. For what? We'll clean up the neighborhood. - All of this? - Yup. But not like janitors, more like Superman. - Dad. - Like Batman. Like- Like the Guardian Angels. Yeah, like Guardian Angels. 'Cause there are two things, best things for a man: provide and protect. And I'll protect you. Always. Pavel. Vlad. The people outside. Hello Uncle. Speak English now, Pavel. - Where they speak English? - American. He forget all of his Russian. - American. - American. It's always the same. How long you gonna keep this shit up? Maxim, show Daniel closing rounds, hmm? Now Pavel, what is this? What is what? That ugly thing. It's new sign. - That's not a sign. - This is Yuri. He cooks and shit. Sometimes all at once. English, shithead. Daniel, meet the animals. You wanna get your fat ass kicked again? Pick that up. Ooh, I'm telling. Still short! Let's go. Let's go. Muah. Yes, baby. Come on. Suka. Suka. - Yes. Vlad, be quick with that shit. Yes, yes. Quick, okay. Okay, okay. Time to go. What I have said? Let's go. Come on, come on. Okay, come on. C'mon. Why are we here? But we paid on time, right? Yes. Checking up on Amerikashka. Your uncle make good money with us. Good? For peasants. I'm here to make great. But we made our payments, right? And then what is your concern beyond that? Vlad, Vlad. Maybe Mr. Ivan have good idea. Nostrovya. Pull up your drawers, boys and girls. Five minutes. You ready? Okay. I was born ready. The line is: "I was born ready." Geesh. Hey, what's the opposite of fun? You mean the antonym? It's Daniel. Yay, Danetchka. Your new name is Auntie Nim. Daniel-san. Yes, a crane technique if do write. No can defense. - Nostrovya. - Nostrovya. Tomorrow, I throw party here. What party? After hours. $700, your cut. Bullshit. Who keep junkies and Italians from shake you down, huh? We are partners. We're nothing. Ah, Maxim. You check everything? Oh, we have a visitor. Come here. Come. Looks just like you, Pavel. A gift for my partner's son. Please open it. Open it. Go ahead. Put it in your hand. Feel the weight. Knife was used. Sorry, I clean. Like new. Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Daniel! Daniel. Daniel. Get the car. Shut the fuck up. Get the car. You know, funding should be a portion according to the needs of the district, right? Now we need affordable housing in my district this cycle. If we go into that room sounding like Karl Marx's cliff notes, then we're gonna need new jobs in November. Now you all know Mr. Dan Reznick Esquire from the Newark Works employment outreach in my district? Hammer of the gods. I'm sorry? Well you're 3/5 of the city council. You have Mayor Apple gate at your mercy. Okay, so how's that gonna help to get affordable housing in my district? Well respectfully, this is already one of the most affordable communities in the county. Right. So then why do I have four overflown shelters in my district? Many of the people in those shelters were my clients. Hmm, I get it. So you'll agree then? We just need to stick our heels in the dirt, build affordable homes while there's still HUD money. Our friends at those shelters wouldn't have a problem finding affordable homes if we could fix their problem finding employment. I like where you're goin'. Bras tacks. Brass tacks? You form a voting block on the HUD allocation. Promise Mayor Apple gate smooth sailing on the downtown development if and only if you control the resident employment allocations. Mm-hmm, see? Trade votes for higher paying jobs in our districts. How many jobs? Well fast and dirty? With a maintenance contract guarantee tacked on, I'd say at least 300 jobs in the first six months. Hire them right outta the shelter. I took the liberty to begin drafting a bid and the hiring practices guidelines for your review of course. Counselor, flip me your card. I have a few good constituents that could use help staying in their homes. I'm not practicing at the moment. Oh, well I expect we'll see a lot of you. Keep up the fight. Yeah. Thanks. Yes? They're comin'. When? 24 to 42 hours from now. But I told 'em that I would go to them. I know, but they don't want that. So what do they want? They wanna make an example of you in your home. Am I just supposed to take that? Listen to me. Get your wife and your family outta your house now. I'm sorry. How are you? Good see you tonight. Me? Fucking great. Good week. Pretty, pretty good. You know, my offer still stands. Crazy we still do this. I work this week. You work next. Either one of us own only half business. At least sit down with me. I make you fair offer: buy out your half of the business. Until next week. Yo, what the fuck you doin' out here, white boy? Nice rims. I could sneak up on Snowden in this shit. Oh yeah. Yeah, definitely. Conflict minerals sure are stealthy in that. Fuck I tell you about this shit? I do need that bread, man. Three months. Um. Fuck you, man. Fuck you. Ah come on, man. Yo, the council boy's doin' you all right down the way? Yeah, I don't have the formal approval yet. But I'm tellin' you I got these guys right- Listen, listen, listen. I told you you supposed to call me, all right? I told you call me. C'mon, let's go. I knew all about your little meeting. No coincidences, huh? Shit. This is my town. It was a no-brainer for them. I did all the work. I wrote the proposal. I drew up the playbook. Did you tell the councilwoman that you got disbarred? No. No, I was suspended. Not disbarred. Same thing. Shit came up anyway. When? Right after you left. I just got the play by play. Well you know, it's a matter of public record. It looks like a reason for them to shift this grant money in another direction. You mean all this work for nothin'? No. They'll use your playbook but probably without you. Yeah. And if I raise the stake, they just tossed the whole thing and nothing good comes out of it. Catchin' on quick, son. Fuck, man. They'd be walkin' to City Hall with their tail between their legs if it weren't for me. You're right. Listen, I told you, all right? You ain't from around here. Your shit wasn't gonna go any farther than what you could already finance on your own unless you had a born and bred on board. Born and bred? Like who? Me, for one. You? You wanna be in the job placement business? No. I wanna be in the Daniel Reznick business, son. Fuck outta here. Listen. People in this community, they love you. They love you in this neighborhood. You've been helpin' people for years and years for no other reason but just because they need it. Shit. And I know that a nice little Jewish boy like you don't mess up no bill payments. So you got to be fucked up if I'm sittin' here waitin' on three months rent. I told you I was gonna take care of that this weekend. I know, I know. You can go home and run to your pops and get that. But what I'm saying- - Really? - Listen, what I'm sayin'. What I'm offering is a chance for you to get out on your own. Get you some of that grant money. Get you a nice little six-figure salary, your little office and your rent paid for, electricity paid for. What's in it for you? My name already ring out in the streets. A restaurateur or producer, real estate magnate. But with you? I am going to be Newark's homegrown savior of District 6. I'm in charge. That's fine. Listen, I just wanna make a few calls and give you a big enough lane to run right through. So? Make your calls. My man, my man. Yeah, just listen. You're just gonna godfather this thing through, right? I don't do well with partnerships. Oh, this ain't no partnership, see? We gon' Batman and Robin this motherfucker. Go home, D. 10 minutes and I'm out. It's gonna be too big. Oh. This I like. Think so? Absolutely. Thank you. You look good to me. It's beautiful. Can't take your eyes off? Really will match perfectly with the living room set in our new house in the country. Bid 95. Thank you. Are you familiar with von Ostrowski or Serrano? It's very important. Yes, I remember. Von Ostrowski worked in fecal matter. Like Ofili, right? Right, but he also worked in ejaculate. Sorry? He use it as a glaze in some of his painting. Oh. Actually the influence runs throughout this show. Maybe we should- It'll change color as it ages. Yes, with a wonderful organic patina. That might not work. We're gonna take a look at a few other pieces before we decide. Sure. Take your time. Not a word, Maxim. 15K. That's some money shot. Egg whites. Liar, liar. I only told them influence. Expensive pomposity, cousin. Nate Dogg, you catch that? I'll need five minutes alone with him. You just love rejection. That old Jack is ready to sell. This time it's real. He's meeting me tomorrow. I need 3 maybe 4 million from Nathan, tops. Oh, that's all? Fuck. And when you figure they'll be finished over there? First part of the Market Line, 2019. That soon, huh? The high line meets Italy via Brooklyn Fleet but more upscale. And at the base of a couple hundred thousand square feet of the hottest condos in town. Okay and our targets, where are the current rents at now? It's in the gutter. I'll work these buildings like a maniac. I'll evict the non-payees, the non-B&Bers and relocate the stragglers. That's a tall order. I'm gonna make 'em an offer they can't refuse. Can we do that? I've worked this with a few of Mr. W's buildings. I know the tenants. I know who's a deadbeat, who's a drug dealer, which little old lady's ready to move to Florida. All right, so how long 'til we can clear them all out? A year, 18 months tops. What's the catch? You're getting an amazing price. The pricing is the by-product of a decade of indentured servitude. All right. I need a quick answer for the old man before he has time to reconsider. Do I have a partner? 15 million? When can you get a copy of the PPM to my attorney? Next week. Not a problem. Come by, we'll have a drink. This guy. Don't scare me like that. I'm sorry. Look, Vlad. One, two, three, four. Four place settings. - Right. - I just set the table. Right. I'll be back at 2:00. Da, da. You're a good boy. Always happy. I try my best. Those three walk ups on Delancey, you got your price? 12. 12 million is a gift for those three buildings. Of course, keep it in the family. Boychik, I gotta know you got the money, hmm? Two weeks, I got 100 brokers chasing me down the street. I'll get you proof of funds by tomorrow. Good. Now go hump something young tonight, hmm? My dick hasn't worked since the 1980s and you're not getting any younger yourself. Moshe! Yeah, you. Bring my shoes. Unc, everything all right? Yeah. I got the TV for her room. She'll be real comfortable. Look. I'm usually in the old neighborhood in the mornings, so I can pop in on Pavel and check in on things. Sasha, just make sure she takes her pills every day. Sasha. I was just thinking. I know you don't like me there, but Pavel needs someone checkin' on him. No, no, no. Police! Put your hands up! Put your hands up! I'm teachin' at Rutgers again this semester. Yeah. With Amtrak, it's really easy. So I promise we'll make it happen this time. Hit one of those Rodezio spots on me. Where's his head? He's good. You know, considering, right? What're we lookin' at? Daniel, you know I can't. Okay. Thanks. You got it. Mr. Reznick. Look, don't talk details. He's been in solitary the last three days, so just be together. 'Kay. Just one? 15 minutes. You look good. Yeah. Yeah, you too. And you're going to see your mother tonight. Yeah. Good. That's great. Dad- Yeah, just tell her that I'm strong. I'm good. Everything is fine. And you'll take care of her while I'm here, right? Of course. Your Uncle Sasha will be there for a week. Dad, what happened? I'd like to ask you. What happened with you? I didn't know. I was in Newark. I'm helping someone. Well you're in Newark. You're always in Newark with those junkies running like crazy. They're not and I'm fine. What happened this time? A little boy almost died. Oh, sorry. So you're a doctor now? No, they need my help. Can you help? - Yes. - Like an attorney. Well not in this instance, no. But you are an attorney. Well uh, the thing I wanted to- I can't hear you, Daniel. I got suspended. You got suspended. My license to practice law. For how long? Three years. For how long didn't you tell me? Let me walk the streets like an idiot. Dad, I was gonna tell you. I tried to so many times. How long did you? - Six months. - How come? I was doin' the right thing. You're not an attorney anymore. Not for three years. I was thinking this is the time when I need my son, the big shot lawyer to help me, to protect me. And instead, you're helping those people. Dad, those people needed me. I needed you. What happened? Doesn't matter. Telly will take care of this. - I can help. - No. - That's why I'm here. - No, Daniel. Listen, all I want you is to take care of your mother. I can help. And Maxim will take care of my week at the banya. - Maxim? - Yes. Why Maxim? I'm your son. And you have to see Anielka. - Ani? - Yes, Ani. Ani, she's been taking care of your mother. If you want me to look at your account- No. 'Kay, just gimme five more minutes. Come on! Kid. You all right? Yeah. Oh, Prince Danetchka! Sit, sit, sit. We miss you so much. Law degree like 100,000. He practice seven years. Shit, that's like 300% return on investment before they revoke license. Dad, enough. What? Just like when I get credit card, buy thousands worth of stuff, hmm? Throw card away, report stolen. Can't keep forever. What? Hit up the Koreans last week in Coney. Hey Kostya, where you been? - At the Sweet Shop? - What happened? What happened to the inspector? Hey. The sidewalk may crumble under foot. Ani? She's all grows up and she's all grows up. The most overrated movie ever. I can't believe it. You were just- 14. Right. - Yeah. Drink, stranger. You look great. Not as good as he did at your eighth grade prom. Shut up. Max. What? I wanted to take Nana to the prom, but she dissed me. I'm good. My father asked me to come see you. He looks good? Yeah. Well. Yeah. Bunch of shite's what it is. We'll have him home in no time. So Newark, huh? Yup. Daniel hated makin' bank. Not true. I was rooting that he would leave this white shit behind. Well they didn't need me in that world anymore. We all have to find where we are needed. Speaking of where we're needed, excuse me. Are you going to stick around this time? No, I'm just here for a few days. I have responsibilities in Newark. And whose responsibility is that? He's a good egg, but he will really benefit from a steady-level head like yours around here. My father doesn't want me involved. Your father listens to me. Ani. I don't think I should be here. You haven't been here a lot, not since I was a girl. But for some reason, this place seems complete when you're around. I'll come back more often. I promise. Keep this one off the floor. You will slip. And we need this head of yours in one piece. They rob us! Damn shakedown! Rob us? They can shut us down. What, your hand's broke? You can't make call? Only numbers you know are for bookie, OTB and loan shark for when you lose to bookie and OTB. You're going to bankrupt us with this shit, fuckin' suka! - Suka? - Suka! Come here, I bend you over! Make you my suka! Stop! Three days! Three days, my father's gone. This place is already- Danny. Get your father upstairs! Come on. Hurts more than you think, you know? I mean all that stuff you see in the movies about people gettin' cut and people gettin' stabbed, you wouldn't think it hurt as much, but it does. You know I gotta get an eye patch? Yeah, I'm gonna be like Snake Plissken. What's he say? "I don't give a fudge about your war or your president." "Escape from New York". Daniel? Daniel. Come on, Daniel. Any sound in there? Danetchka. Daniel. They're gonna be fine. Just make sure they both take their full course of antibiotics. - Thank you very much, Doctor. - That's it? I'm done? Yeah. Hey, hey. Don't play with that. You'll be back in a couple days to see the plastic surgeon, Max. So just relax. The name's Plissken. - Excuse me? - And I don't give a fudge about your war or your president. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. "Escape from New York". - Thank you. - Take care, gentlemen. Hey, look what somebody brought for you. Whoa. How 'bout that? Young Guardian Angels. Let's go home now. Let's go. Mametchka had cooked some lamb for you. Let's go. Just be careful, yeah? That everything? Speak English here. Collect 50% from that asshole selling coke. Make an example of him if he says anything, okay? My pleasure. Be back at 11:00. Daniel. Daniel. Nyet. Katya. Katya! Hey Robert, Robert, Robert. How 'bout another coffee? Katya. Robert. It's a dangerous neighborhood. I think I'll be okay. Whoa. Robert here thinks that the Russian mafia is after us. I'm not on the clock. No? Were you on the clock when we're having coffee inside. That could've gone wrong in 100 different ways. Thank you. This only gets worse. By the way, we can take care of our own. What are you? I'm Julia Shields. I'm from the firm, Mr. Reznick. Where is Telly? I'm very familiar with your case. Telly brought me up to speed. Where is he? He's been indicted in connection to the case. I suggest we don't waste any time. Racketeering, murdering? This has nothing to do with me. RICO, conspiracy. They're grabbing everyone. And how long is this going to take? It could be a couple of years. What about bail? Maybe 500. 500,000? Possibly. Plus the legal fees? No, I can shift costs and billable. You shift nothing. I'm not a charity case. I'll pay it. It is going to be a fight getting your private accounts unfrozen. We got joint accounts. Yes and I've been through all of it. And if we don't get you out soon, Kat's going to be in trouble. Go to the banya and find Anielka, ask her to go to the Albanian. She'll get you paid. Okay? Ruslan Arshavsky, Alexei Shapiro, Aaron Abromovitz. 43 co-conspirators, I know only two of them. Verkovsky, you lent him money. Yes, for his Internet cafe. How the fuck does this make me a murderer? Verkovsky gave cover to Arshavsky and Shapiro's group of Internet scammers. Because they're his tenants. They traded cryptocurrency for stolen credit card numbers. So? And they were infiltrated by an FBI informant named Ilsa Sokolov who was found dead three weeks ago. More than 40 stab wounds inflicted by a paring knife from a cutlery set bought in bulk with Abromovitz's stolen credit cards. What do they want from me? Evidence. I don't know these people. You know Verkovsky. And if you can help them paint him into a corner, then they can turn the heat up on the next guy up the ladder. What's going on? One of your client's buddies just got got in the shower. You listen to me. I will work. Hey, hey! I will work this out. Keep to yourself. Listen, go to Anielka. Tell her to feel the Albanian. I will need a new partner. Please. Okay. What? You keep texting me about getting comped bottle service at the club. You're my hookup. I am outta the club scene. 100%? 100%. Out. Thought you were just playin'. Mm-hmm. How's Uncle Vlad? Under the circumstances, he's fine. And you? I'm okay. We're gonna get through this together. You're here for the monthly. Um, not exactly. He asked me if you can do half. Half? Your balance. I don't have that here. No, of course not. But tomorrow, I'll make it happen. Thanks. I'm sorry. Don't say my name. How did? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Did you get my message? I'm with her. The balance, the number that I sent you, that's her balance. Get half of it. I understand. Collect the rest from all the others. We need all of it. 'Kay. Are you safe? I'm okay. I just need to get out of here as soon as possible. I will. V, baby! I am sorry I missed the grand opening. Zim, we missed you. Next one. Yeah, next one. Vince at the club sends his love. Aww. And Jojo at Withdrawl asked me to give you her cell. I'd love to see Jojo. I tell 'em, "She's off chasin' her dreams. Hit her up on the 'grams. She got 90,000 followers." 120,000. 120,000 followers. Watch and learn, boys and girls. I mean shit, I own six nightclubs. Your family owns them. Six nightclubs, four restaurants, one hotel and I barely get 15,000 followers. We're gonna go grab a bite with Chuck and Agron. Wanna join? Two cafes and tattoo parlor? No partners. Wow. Long hours, but you know. I know, don't I? Hey, V ever tell you how we met each other? V and I dated college year in freshmen upstate. After we broke up, she still needed me for weed and rides back home from school. So we made an arrangement. Okay, that's enough. A dime bag meant a hand job. Coke was a blow job. And a ride home, that meant I was gettin' that sweet, sweet ass. No strings attached. You're an asshole. Her dad disappeared on her and her mom could barely pay her rent, so I guess I get a scholarship. Get out. Now I don't even get a return call. I told you I am done. Done? Yeah, done. Bull. Hey, hey! Nobody tells me shit since I'm 14 years old, bitch. Stay down, Zim. I'll get ice. Russian deadbeat dad. Vetone! The fuck happened? Hi. This is our first time. Oh, wow. First time. Fuck your mother with a chainsaw! Uncle Kos! Sorry, Katya. Sorry. I have excellent idea for shark tank. What does that mean? Kostya: king of all losers. Hi banya? No. No, you didn't leave. No nothing in lost and found, no bathing suit. Don't call bookie this time. Bet with me on next race. The seventh? How much you down today? 500. I got like 10 bucks left. Shit. Okay, I give you 50 to one odds. Any horse you want. I take the favorite, number nine. You could take Moses riding unicorn with rocket up its ass, you'd still lose. - Vetone. - Hey. Daniel. Daniel, Vetone. My pleasure. Same. Boxes. Yo, we good? They behavin'? Yeah, yeah. They're fine. I gotta talk to you about the bills, man. I don't know how this place survives. I don't get it. There's a guy named Nathan comin' by tonight. Somethin' I need to worry about? Nah. Remember Fat Jack's buildings? I'm buyin' 'em. 12 mil. I gave him a higher number, improvements and whatnot. How much? 15. They don't know you're flippin' the contracts. That's why I'm gettin' 3 mil in a month. Shit. Oh, sorry. It's my fault. Hey, who's Vetone? Family friend. She's here to help. How? She owns your father. I don't think I wanna know then. I helped her to fund a coffee shop, a tattoo parlor and an online art auction. Not everyone can walk into the bank for a business loan. All right, I know. I know. Pillar of the community and all that. I get it. What do you think of your father? I think he's running this place like it's 1978 and I don't know how he has enough money. It's enough money to take care of your mom for another month or two and the rest to pay your father's bail. Yeah, then what? Can I count on you to stick around? Yeah, of course. Just need to go and make a few deposits. Well I'll go with you. I'm black belt and kung fu, jujutsu and the art of seduction. All Russian women are. Paulius? Bank is further down. Leave the money here and get out. What? Do it now. You fucking kidding me? Your hand will heal. If your old man is gone for good, I've got nothing. Take a cab. Get out. Moshe, rub some on my feet. Valuables in the box. Is Maxim or Anielka here? Nathan? Yeah. Oh great. Yeah, please have a seat. He'll be right back. Hey Uncle Kos, can you grab me some change? What, you don't want my help, Danetchka? I thought it was your week off. I didn't wanna bother you. After this race. Hey mom, I'm goin' to the back. I'll be right back. Just stay here, 'kay? Uncle Kos, keep an eye on her please. Hey, you should try it. I don't have any mud. Why are we hiding up here like we're skipping home ec? 'Cause I don't wanna share my best shit with everybody. You good? One more. What's in there? Treatment room. I've known Anielka for years, yet this is my first time here. Sure, it's the secret to a wonderful life, boychik. What's your game? - They're closing in, bitch. Art dealer primarily. But I'm about to buy property in the neighborhood. No! - Where? - Yes, yes, yes! Mother fuck! Down the way on Delancey. Really? How much? What happened? I just fall and twisted it. Come, sit down. Can you get her some ice please? Lemme see. Are you all right? Are you okay? We should get her to a hospital. Yeah, good idea. Can you get her a car? Yeah. Lemme see this. I just twisted it. Paulius? Paulius did this to you? Just say the word and I'll get your money back, baby. He robbed you? My father's bail money. V? Yeah, baby. Okay. I'm comin' with you. Are you sure you wanna do that? We're gonna give her a few minutes. When she drops her key card, that's the signal. What this guy do? Cheated on my girl. Wait. Do you like fucking with people that are weaker than you? Poor baby. So powerless. And you have a gun in your hand. But I still win. What the fuck? He doesn't have the money with him. He's gonna lead us to it. Boom! Prince Danetchka, this is from Maxim, me and your aunt. Say spasíba. Spasíba. Aww, sorry Maxim couldn't be here. He's still on antibiotics and needs to rest, hmm? I know. Come. I think I may have way out. What do you mean? - Kostya! - Hey! Where's the birthday boy? How you doing, buddy? - Good. - Yeah? It's good birthday? Just so many adults here, right? And nobody is interested in the same things you are interested in, right? Yeah. Right. Okay. So I think I have the cure. An Apple lie Plus? Awesome! Can I plug it in? You plug it in when you get home and with your father, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Danetchka. Happy birthday, big boy. Kostya. Kotya, that's too much. We can't. What? I had a good year. Come on. I thought you said market was down. Up, down. Does it matter? Just need to be on the right side of trade. How's Maxim? Oh, you know kids. Resilient. He'll be okay. But those bastards from Brighton beach, can't get them off our backs. What did you guys do? We borrowed some money. Are you behind them payments? No. No, no. It's just now they think that they're our partners because we owe them the money. How much is the note for? It's for $100,000 plus the deed to the banya. How much is the bank loan? No, there's no bank loan. It's just them. 100,000. Yes. What percentage of this business you give me today if I pay it off? What? You gonna pay $100,000 today? Yes. This is very early, gentlemen. We wanted to thank you for your generosity. The business is doing great and we wanted to pay off the loan, make you full. Um no. Um, make you whole. Full, what the fuck? This loan should've taken 10 years to pay off. We calculated your lost interest and paid you for five years. I can't help but think that this is due to my nephew's ambitious techniques. He told me what happened with the boys and that it was accident. Your generation, the necessary risk you take. Wait. We wanted to pay you while we had the money. In any event, we look forward to doing business with you again in near future. Receipts. I be right back, okay? Oh. Dad? Yeah? Are we safe now? Yes, we're safe. Uncle Kostya said those men won't come back. No, they won't. We're cleaning up the neighborhood, remember? Next time, mind your fuckin' business. Pick him up. - Get up. Yeah, I know but. Katya. I miss you. Ma, who're you talkin' to? Hello? Don't say my name. Just listen. I might not be able to talk to you again. Daniel. I'm very proud of you. I just can't believe we managed to raise such beautiful person. Dad, I love you. I love you too, son. - Yeah. - I'll see you soon, 'kay? Did you think about what I asked you last night? The loan. It's just for a few days. You know I can't access that kinda money without it raisin' a red flag. Hey, come on. It's gonna be okay. Let's talk about this room full of amazing work you won't let anyone see. I'm not ready. So you say. Are you just changing the subject? You should at least let me get you up in another gallery. When I'm ready. And when's that gonna be? When I am. It's a shame. So when is your divorce happening? Timing is bad. Timing's been bad for two years. I can say the same about your work. Hey. I have to make a breakfast meeting. Tell Maxim he owes me a call. Hello Vetone? Yeah, it's Anielka. We have a problem. What? Can you get something for me from the outside? Yeah, size? It's a SIM card. Yeah, got fresh papers? It'll cost you double. - No problem. - 10th Street, right? Goddamn, man. - What? You drink too much fuckin' coffee. What do you mean? This tastes like shit. Oh, literally? Yeah, literally. What the fuck you lookin' at? Break it up! Break it up! All right, let's see how you two shit bags like a night in the hole. How the fuck did you find me? I stopped by your cafe. Caught someone that didn't recognize you? Yeah, I suppose. What are you doing here? Is this how you greet your father? You are nothing to me. I've thought about you every day for the last 15 years. Not enough to cut your bullshit when I needed you most. I've come to tell you I'm sorry. And I'm in the middle of something. So if you wanna play your imaginary reconciliation, it's gonna have to wait. I was selfish, but you're goin' to need me now more than ever. Need you? I never needed you. Not even after what you did yesterday? A mutual friend brought your name up in connection to a missing Albanian club owner. I don't know what you mean. Don't lie to me, Vetone. I am the only one who can help you now. Huh? You do everything I tell you to do. And why would I do that? Because I can still save you, even though I haven't been a father to you. And if I don't? You will lose everything and I will lose the only thing that ever mattered. Wait. I will need you. So what did I miss? Miss? I'm just getting warmed up, Junior. So how we doin'? Are you ready to turn over the files this week? Boychik, I gotta hand it to you. You outdid yourself. With what? 15 million is a great price. - Huh? - What price? My buildings on Delancey. 15 mil, what are you talkin' about? The deal's for 12. No, no, no. That's when you were with Vlad. But you brought in Nathan for 15, he told me. You and Vlad? You and Vlad? Ah, take it easy, Pavel. No, that cocksucker won't talk to me for 15 years and you are buying property with him? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Maxim brokered the deal. Kiddo, I'm going to pay you a commission. Don't worry. Let's say um, 30,000. 30,000? "Hey, thank you, Moshe." Who the fuck do you think you are? Hey. Come back, you bastard. Come back here. I'm going to kiss you. Hey. Hey. Kostya, right? Yeah. What you up to, Uncle Kos? Nothing. We're headin' over to the Baths. Oh, maybe I meet you later. Okay. We're gonna chip in in the first at Belmont. Are you in? My uncle, he's a trainer. Six to one. It's a lock. I won 20 grand last time. Going for 40 today. Okay, maybe one race. Attaboy. - All right. - Oh yeah. Let's go. What the fucks are you doing? Get the fuck out of here. Baby, what's wrong? What's wrong? Have fun. Hi Maxim. V, got a sec? Is she good? Nah. No, maybe we should hang out later. Give it another shot. Are you coked up? No, I'm fine. Where you goin'? Bathroom. My meds. Leave the bag. We'll watch it. I have to change. Come on. Hey. I really need to lay down. Sure. Hey. Thanks for doin' this. I mean I feel as if she were my own mom. Yeah. You look like you haven't slept in a week. Are you okay? Yeah. I really like this one. Nathan and V are always trying to get me to exhibit. Whenever you're ready. Yes. What's this? This is my signature. It's beautiful. 14 years in the making. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I should go. Sure, sure. But just let me know when Vetone gets back to you and I think we just need to get him out today. 'Course. I'm gonna make it happen. Hey, come on. The race starts in 10 minutes. Let's get some quick heat in. All right. Oh, I gotta make a phone call. I'll be right down. Just you and me, old man. Hey. Who we like in the first race? C'mon. You gotta have a tip. You're not gonna tell me who we have? What do you got? Come on. Open it. Open it. You got three options. One, I tell Vlad everything. Maybe he takes some pity on you, but I wouldn't count on it. Two, we drive you to the middle of the woods and you disappear. My personal favorite. You sell your piece of the Baths to me and our secret stays a secret. The drugs are yours. Should net you enough money to pay off your bookies. Hey. D, come sit. We good? We're good. Relax. Then what? We stopped by his apartment this morning. He must've forgot it there. Kostya, tell him about the other thing. I'm gonna retire and V's gonna buy my piece of the business. Excuse us a second. C'mon. Let's talk. Get the fuck over here. Why? Danetchka. My father's life for what? For what? Answer me! How could you? You're pathetic. Get the fuck outta here. Don't ever come back here again. I don't know you anymore. Daniel. Yeah. Lawyer. Everything okay? Yeah, I'm on my way. Thanks. Danetchka. You got it, Pop. Thank you. Yeah. - Thank you. - You got it. You got it. You okay? - Yeah. - You all right? Dad, you don't have to thank me. Nah, I never intended for this to happen. My problems to become your problems. Oh no, no, no. Take that. Take that and take care of the people in Newark. No, it's okay. I'm here with you guys. Daniel, it's not okay. I was supposed to take care of you, not the other way around. Listen. Hey, I'll be fine. Just go to Newark. Katya. Katyusha. Oh my god, thank you. Welcome back home. Thank you. Daniel, go. Go! Seriously, go. Do you have to go? Yeah, just a couple hours. Maybe just stick around here. We could have something to eat. Yeah. Listen, how well do you know Vetone? Why? You know what? Never mind. Another time. Tonight we have dinner, yeah? Sure. I'll be back soon. Ivan. Welcome home. Thank you. Ooh. To family. Mmm. Hey dad, one more thing I wanted to- Danetchka? Prince Danetchka. How long has it been? Long enough. Ivan is a friend now, Daniel. I come in peace. I'll explain it to you. Danetchka, you look like ghost. Oh. - Pavel. Nice to see you. - You too. - Mr. Ivan. Nostrovya. Nostrovya. Is Ivan here? I am Ivan. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, hey, hey. - What're you doin'? You wanna hear a funny story? Sure. My young brother Zim goes missing after he goes chasing some hooker he used to fuck. We don't know shit. All of a sudden I get a phone call from you tellin' me you know where he is. That's right. So where is he? I can tell you where his body is. His body? Bergen field Park, New Jersey. You drive exactly 1.2 miles into the park, then you go into the woods on your left. You'll see a large pine with your brother's tongue nailed to it. That's where he's buried. How do you know he's buried there? I'm the one who put him there. Can we talk? - Shut the fuck up! - No, no, no, no. It's okay. - Just talk. - It's okay. I'm the one who killed him. Ivan. No one else here had anything to do with it. Ivan. No witnesses. Daniel. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
