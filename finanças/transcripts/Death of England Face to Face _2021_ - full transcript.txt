Fight or flight. Stay down! – What you gonna do? – Don't think about having a Brown kid. ...Fucking get to say that! – This is my country too! – Low on fucking Englishness. I was outraged. – I was outraged. – She was livid. - – As for her mum... - She'd be outraged. But that's kinda standard Carly behaviour, right? – Yeah. – I think she finds it entertaining. There's a bit of her that finds it fun. She gives it all the morality shit. It's a fucking giggle for her, helps her sleep at night, it does. Oh, shut the fuck. Like you're so different. Er, did I say that? Did I say I was different? – It's morning, noon and night with you. – What? Chief, I'm with her, ain't I? I'm still with her, after all the shit she laid on me, at my door. I must like it, agree with it. You fuckin' love it. Do you mind? Mouth closed. Grown-up talking. Obviously, I must get buzzed up by it, by her, or... ...this little sleeping bundle of mischief wouldn't be laying in my front room, now, would she? – Guess not, no. – No. Thank you. Not that her laying here is a given piece of joy. It's more a stolen moment, hoisted on a sea of change, shame and... Regret. – Yeah. – Yeah. Even though it's still burning me, that he, Delroy, gave me such a rinsing. Even though I know now it was wrong, I mean, to be honest, like, mate, you levelled some high-grade, new-wave, blackety-black-lens shit on me, that even though I've been your mate, your brer, since I sprouted pubic hair, it's like I just met ya. – – You see that? What he just did there, that. There, where he's now the victim. He's now my victim. When he clearly started with, 'Even though I know I was wrong, ' it's ended up with me somehow hiding some shit from him. – You was fucking wrong. – Yeah. – But... – But what? Just because your 'lens' is different, don't make it right, does it? You just said to them, to me, you was wrong. Yeah, but there's wrong and wrong though, ain't there? – Is there? – Ask 'em. Tell 'em, ask 'em, see what they say. – This guy... – I'll bet you it's... This guy, you... Listen, you just said, you just admitted it. You can't even hold your own point of view for three minutes, can you? I was under the impression that you'd seen the benefits even if I was... – What? – What? How do you mean what? Say it, say wrong? It's like we're in court and he's reading out the charges. Check this out, right? Delroy here dates my sister. Now... Anyone with a sister knows technically that is a red-card offence right there. My sister, you know? Troubling my blood with his tings. See, I can't even, all now, see straight when I say that, even though I know he's good for her, even if I have pushed them together at points, it's still a thing – it is! So... Familial sexist BS aside, he's dating my sister. They've been keeping it on the downlow, 'cause as you may or may not know, my dad had... tendencies. 'Tendencies'? He was of a certain generation. He's low on fuckin' Englishness. He means racist generation. – You could say that. – Yeah, I did. I just said that. Yeah. And they, him and my sister, had to keep it secret because of the racist generation. Hold up. Hold up. Stop. – Pull up two secs. – What? What you just said there, – about generation... – Yeah? We saying everyone? Like, his whole generation was racist? – Well, it's... – What? – Likely. – Really? What, everyone? Really? No, you can't label all Brits with that, 'cause that ain't true. That's like to say all them people who marched for Mandela, of your dad's generation, that mob from Rock Against Racism in the '70s, racist? – That lot was all right. – I get your point. It was your dad's lot! – Even if I did like him... – Go on, Delroy! Sometimes. It weren't everyone, was it? – – He's dead, mate. Yeah, I know. My dad's dead. Look, can we just... What? What, lie? Sure. Sorry, I just... Well, yeah. So, the rest weren't full-on rac... You know, like my dad. But they were fucking solid-gold bystanders, right? Prize colluders. Nobody told him shit. They were like, 'It's an opinion, racism is an opinion.' Still like it now, man, so let's just fucking lay off him a bit. Yeah, I hear ya. I was... Lost what I was trying to say now. You was telling them about how you weren't wrong. Yeah, right, well... He's dating my sister. And, well, he manages to get himself arrested. Hence the tag he's so beautifully sporting. – Thanks. – And he's held in a holding cell, while my sister is giving birth to his kid. – It's a bit more complicated than that. – Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Innocent, racist police, Black Lives Matter, not the point I was trying to make. If they haven't heard you banging on about it, I'm sure you'll be giving them another opportunity later. So, anyway, he's fallen out with my sister, missed the birth of his kid, on a tag, in fucking lockdown. Yeah, that's my Delroy, typical Delroy. In fact, on your gravestone, it should just say the word, 'Typical.' Yeah, and on yours, it should just say 'cunt'. And in the middle of this debacle, when he did finally get to the hospital, he tore so many strips off me, I left there looking like a human zebra. Where were you? How you gonna make amends? – Well, I... – And a lot of it was justified. So, months later now, today, earlier today, in fact, I've gone to see Carly. I'm standing outside the door just about to put me mask on, but it's looking pretty manky, the white side of it has gone all furry like the top of an out-of-date jar of jam, and my breath had made it stink like a homeless man's boxer shorts, - – when... - – What are you doing here? Was squeezed through the now-ajar door by my PPE'd-up mum. Mum, you don't need to wear all that if you ain't going out. You sorted that money? Her blue eyes looking more piercing and dangerous from behind her masked face. I said I'd sort it, didn't I? We are depending on you to get that money. I know it's not gonna be easy. Don't fuck this up, Michael. It's not... 'I won't, ' I replied with the demeanour of someone about to well and truly fuck this up. Good. Now, what do you want? You ain't coming in here with that toss rag round your face. I came to see Carly, Mum. What's up with you today? If you haven't noticed, we're on lockdown. I'm not looking to catch any germs off you and nor is Carly. She's still poorly from the C-section and vulnerable. I pushed up against the door trying not to annoy her, but to make my desires known and felt. Mum, don't be so para. Move. She didn't move a millimetre. Come on now, Mum. She just stared at me like a K9 sizing up an intruder. I want you out the front room by the time the news... - Starts? - Finishes. I don't wanna see or hear any more from that walking dildo Johnson today. 'Will do, ' I replied with a pubescent shrill, - as she scuttled up the stairs, shouting... - And wash your bloody hands! Try and replace... Now... ...to be honest, I've had little contact with babies. Not sure why, but I've got more skills managing a Staffordshire bull terrier than a human baby, which is maybe not the best admission. As for Carly, babies were seen as not so much an interruption to her lifestyle as akin to being mauled by hyenas, by choice. So... for me to walk into Carly's room and see her glowing and smiling from cheek to cheek would have had to have been a lie. And a fucking lie it is, mate. I turn the corner to witness a flush-faced, greasy-haired Carly, with a milk pump stuck, almost violently, to her left, inflated breast, and her eyes laser burning into my prefrontal cortex the words, 'Help me.' She was sitting remiss of any previously-held dignity, in a dingy looking kinda T-shirt nightie thing, stained tracky bottoms. They ain't working, me tits, me tits ain't working. I can't get anything out of 'em, Michael, and she won't stop crying. - Mum? - Mum? She's no help. She just keeps telling me to stick a little bit of brandy in the fucking formula milk 'cause her mum did it to her. 'And I turned out all right, ' she says, holding her third vodka tonic of the afternoon. Now, I hadn't seen my sister's boobs since Year 7. I walked into the bathroom to see her staring at herself in the mirror topless, like she'd lost something important. And it was just as awkward-making and just plain wrong then as this felt now. - Cover yerself up a bit, will ya? - Look at that! She yelped, exposing a raw, red nipple. I reeled backwards with such shock, I left my body and literally could see us both in the room. But my callousness was an unexpected winner, as in complete Carly fashion, she just burst out laughing at me. – – Men! Bloody hell! You've been sucking on these since adulthood. Now you see what they are actually for, you come in like Priti Patel at a Snoop Dogg gig. Yeah. She had me there. And we laughed. And laughed the kind of laugh only a brother and sister can. I went in for an illegal hug, and luckily, she retrieved said boob, and hugged me tight. I couldn't believe it. It's not that we weren't close, it's just she doesn't cry. I mean, she just don't. So it was there and then that I knew this baby and Delroy had really broken her. I take it you still ain't spoken to Delroy. Oh, we've spoken a few times now. Signal went on us today, though. She said, like a politician talking about Brexshit! And? Tell me the whole truth. Don't leave me hanging here. We're gonna work it out, I think. Twat's come to his senses. Her eyes now twinkling with irony, as she pulled herself together forming that hard shell around herself that I'd grown to love and hate in equal measure. Great stuff. Good for you guys. So, what you gonna call her? I can't name her till he's seen her, can I? Can't get there 'cause of COVID and we can't register her even if we wanted to. And he can't because of his tag and COVID. - The romance here is just so, so beautiful. - Fuck off, dick breath! There it was. Like angels singing, she was back. My sister, Carly Nicola Fletcher. Fully-loaded and dangerous. Well, her mouth was anyway, 'cause she was still moving about like Robbie Coltrane. That was when her nameless baby started wailing. – – Blimey! She could play Wembley Stadium with those lungs. - She's got more life than an Amazon Echo! - I can't take it any more! Just take her out for a walk in the buggy, will ya? - Where can I take...? - Take her anywhere! Just give me an hour off from it, please, Michael. Please, please, please, please! OK, sure. Sure. Sure. It was on that third 'sure' that the idea popped into my head like the first draw on a skunk weed spliff. Delroy's in lockdown, can't see his kid. The sprog is here, right here in my hands. Little sis needs a break. See where I'm going here? You know, it's shocking how much I amaze myself. I'm always thinking. I'm in full bring-the-mountain-to-Mohammed mode. Delroy is gonna love me up when he sees his first born for the first time, no choice. I mean, I know he comes at it all the hard, Black-man vibe, but I know his mellow side. I know all about it, unless there's another Delroy I grew up with, crying like a new-born at the end of Toy Story when we snuck into the Odeon that time, on half term once. Getting all coy, flexing his shoulders up and down, telling me it was a mistake, wrong cinema. It was Mel Gibson giving it large in Braveheart he wanted to see. Truth is, it was Buzz Lightyear he had the melt for. William Wallace my arse. I knew it, he knew it. Just like I know how he is gonna melt when he sees his kid. Carly needed a break, she didn't have to know. Delroy wanted to see his little girl. I didn't see a problem there. So, after a curious journey filled with straight faces, double takes, and what felt like an avalanche of rage and confusion from so-called 'tolerant' Londoners, I arrived at Delroy's. Now, I feel like a cross between Father Christmas and that bird that delivers babies, a heron. Or is it a stork? Can't remember. But I know it has something to do with birds taking nine months to fly from Europe to Africa on their annual migration, only to return exactly nine months later. Yeah, man, that was me flying in from Leyton to Hackney. Not as mythical or strenuous perhaps, but just as romantic, only to be met with... Do you not see a problem here, Michael? From a shocked, static Delroy. Is that all you can say? As opposed to what, please tell me? – Well, have a look. – I'm looking. – It's your little girl, bruv. – Don't call me that. 'All right, mate, ' I said, hearing my self-belief drain away like the last dregs of water from a kitchen sink. I'm still all right to call you mate or is that gonna start a couple of wars here? – Mate is fine. – Good. – Now, see she deh? – I ain't blind. Glad to hear it, then crack a smile, fer fuck! But still nothing back from Mr Ungrateful Clogs over there. My original question holds, Michael. I know that. I ain't stupid. I know your original question holds. Cha rass. What was the original question? – The kid. Why have you brought her here? – Your kid? He said, kneeling down to her level so slowly I wasn't sure he was moving at all. Er, 'cause you are her dad? I thought it might be nice, that kind of thing. – We are in lockdown, Michael. – Is there a point coming here, Del? Understanding his point, but smiling with indifference to it. Does Carly know? – What do you think? – I'm thinking no, 'cause she ain't that stupid. He said, picking her up tenderly. That is a fine way to talk about your woman. She ain't my woman. She don't belong to me. From the minute she met you, she's been reeling you in. You know it, I know it, the whole of East knows it. I watched him, slightly in awe, as he enveloped her into his now concave chest. – Do you wanna see your kid or not? – Course I want to see her. – She's all I've been thinking about. – Well, you got her. – I know. – Well, crack a smile, you cunt. I got him, there and then. Nailed him to the wall of Michaeldom. And what a sight it was – the broadest, unabashed gleeful smile ever. Lockdown, Michael. He said, his eyes glistening in wonder at my audacity. I know you've always been shit at maths, but even you can put this together. – I thought it was worth the risk. – A risk for who? I mean, what are you playing at here, mate, what's the game here? Why are you looking at me like that? He called me mate. You called me mate. Yeah, all right. Don't cream yerself. Who's creaming? Not I. You endangered her, you plank. You didn't even wear a mask. Don't have to wear one out on the street. You didn't need to bring her at all, you rass. – Well, should I take her back? – Take her back? Who are you? DHL? Is that a no, then? It had been a while since I saw her gorgeous, to-die-for little face on my phone screen. And now, there she was, in the flesh. And I hadn't seen him since our encounter at the hospital, where it was everything in me not to lay him out. And now look at him sitting there. I still wanted to lay him out. That's a funny thing about our friendship. I've known this twat since, God knows, 11 or such? And I don't think there's ever been a time, day or place where I haven't wanted to batter the living out of him. My best friend, who I love as a brother. Yes, I said love – let's just park that, shall we? My brother, who I know would lay down in traffic for me. Who even has, once or twice. I'm talking literally, yeah, not hyperbole. Him, lying down in traffic, Michael Fletcher, laying down in front of traffic for me, trust me on that. The upshot is, he's part of me. I'm part of him. Hm! Of course I wanted to see my child. I've thought about nothing else ever since Carly last called me. I wanted to see her face, I needed to, but I wanted to be sure about something. 'Cause when I saw her on the phone screen, I could have sworn I saw, in that beautiful face of hers, the mouth, the exact same mouth as her illustrious granddad – Alan 'Britain first, come on, you long streak of piss' Fletcher. Oi! You long streak of piss. Now, part of me didn't care. But another part, the noisy part of my brain needed to know, yeah? Needed to be sure. And there she was. And there he was. Alan Fletcher, with his twisted lip, on the face of my beautiful child. It was not a dream. I was not imagining things. He was there, he was back, living on in her. – – It's OK. It's all right. Ssh. What would he have said about that, eh? Well, that's a rhetorical question. Yeah, I know exactly what he'd say. He didn't exactly make it a secret on his views on people like us. In fact, his views on us were long and vivid. Low on fuckin' Englishness. Straight off, from looking at my little girl's face, it took me back. All those years of making my life, making Carly's life hell. And Michael's, if he ever had the courage to admit it. Carly had to hide me under her bed one time when Alan came home early from work. Don't ever think about having a brown kid. That's what I was thinking when I saw my little girl. But I had to keep telling myself, yeah, had to remind myself, - – it's not her fault where she come from. - – I tried to think of all the good things that Alan Fletcher said and there was, it must be said, a few good times. When it was a good day and he was on a roll and the rest of them crazy Fletchers, they could be a really good craic. I mean, Alan Fletcher shouted at me good and proper when I missed that penalty against St Paul's. Yeah, and he was the one screaming his lungs out at me... – Keep yer guard up! – ..when I was on the ropes during the fourth round in my fight with Danny Meehan. Oi, Delroy, Delroy! Get yer guard up! And he was the first one to give me an almighty bear hug when I ended up beating him on points. The jokes and the banter we all had in the back of his van, as we drove back across the river. Saveloy and chips all round, stuffing our faces. Here you go, son, chips and saveloy. That's what I needed to remember. That's what I needed to keep in my brain whenever I saw my little girl, which, let's face it, is gonna be every single day of every single moment, if I have anything to do with it. That little girl... is a fact. Yeah, she's my fact. She's my number one. Carly as good as said so herself, which brought me right back to this total waster Carly has the misfortune to call her brother. – Push off! – What you gonna do, Michael? What's the game here, Michael? Game? What bleeding game? You telling me you are only here, you brought her here to me, because you wanted me to see my baby? Duh, yeah! So, there's nothing else you wanna tell me? No, you sap, nothing at all. Mistake number one. There was a bang on the ceiling and I remember trying not to take it in, let it in. I tried not to let it fester. He can't be...? I mean, he just can't be. I said calmly, but clear. What? No worries. Just pass me the nappies. I said, parking the banging, though I knew it had triggered me. Yeah, hold on, just a sec. Michael, tell me you brought the nappies. I wasn't thinking of this as a long ting. Now, at this point, he had a lightness about him which was fucking annoying, but strangely comforting, as I know him to act the arse. Look at the size of her! How long do you think it takes food - to get from there to there? - No worries. Jack's will be open. Did you say Jack's? As in, 'I sell you a single' Jack's? Yes. Shit, man! She won't stop crying. Did you know babies' cries are biologically meant to wind you up? They're meant to vex you – it's a scientific fact – so you help 'em. Now, that doesn't in any way undermine what was coming to pass. In no way whatsoever. But, I guess it's useful to underwrite it with that fact. Anyway, I'd taken to humming Redemption Song by Bob Marley to calm her down, but it's going down about as well as a keynote speech by Prince Andrew at a Time's Up convention. We was kids, man, 'bout he's selling us singles. She's got herself in a right state. That's bang out of order, that though, really. Mate, we need to get her to stop crying. I ain't going in there, man. - What? - Jack's. - She needs a nappy! - We was kids! Yeah, but we couldn't afford a pack of 20. – Kids. – You used to beg him to sell us some. And then, you'd nick a Curly Wurly on the way out. – Kids! – We need a nappy, yeah? I ain't wrapping her in a pillowcase and having Carly cuss me morning, noon and night. – Rock her, then. – It just makes her worse. Now, I wasn't sure as to which type of baffling, cheesy, foot-smelling sheggery I was inhaling was vexing me more. My daughter screaming in my rhaatid ears, this breadfruit eediat man upstairs, or Michael looking at me, a Black man brought up in East London, like he was a victim of serious abuse, when he clearly chooses to illegally buy and smoke fags that we knew we weren't meant to. – – But somehow, in all of that, this guy upstairs was the newer, more toxic and visceral strain of shit. – So, he got my attention. – He's banging because she's crying, ain't he? I ain't having that. Fuck off! I said, with the righteous anger of a 13-year-old and the volume of a deaf 90-year-old, which, of course, was making her more upset. 'Low it, man. 'Low it. He'll stop in a minute. I'd over-reacted. I could tell by the 'What the fuck?' look on his face. Fuck it. I'll go Jack's. I said, trying to regain some pride. No, I'll go. I'll go. It's just... Walking here with her got me thinking about stuff, you know? I blinked wildly at him, but he didn't get the hint. Our adults, our elders, in fact, fucked us, royally fucked us over. I guess every generation says that. But he knew fags were shit for us and we didn't know any better. And still, to make extra fucking pennies, he sold it to us, knowing we'd get hooked and buy more and more, until we could afford a pack of 20. Yes, mate. Consumerism is a bitch. I'm saying... Just be sure to bawl him out about that after you've bought the nappies, capeesh? Then he smiled one of his 'Michael' smiles that made his face crease like only white peoples' faces do. I'd say crow's feet, but that makes them sound bad, 'cause... I loved the way his face did that, made them lines. I loved the honesty in them, the life experience they showed, the singularity of them on the face of my best mate, who had brought my child around to see me. Breaking all kinds of 'effing lockdown laws. So, what could I do? I had no choice. So... I smiled back. Yeah, I hear ya, mate. I hear ya. She's stopped. Look at that. She's sleeping. Ah, well done, mate. I'm just glad she ain't a boy. I've been quiet, ain't I? I've listened as he's mashed me up, but kinda truthfully, admittedly, but here what... when he said that there ting about being glad she wasn't a boy, I gotta say, I've never heard him... Heard you, seen you like that before. Not even at her birth at the hospital? What you gonna do, Michael? How you gonna make amends? Michael, what you gonna do? Yeah, I guess I got a glimpse. So, I can hear you banging on, but I can only feel my pain, my hurt, my confusion, my anger. But when you quietly said, 'I'm glad she ain't a boy.' Brown... Boy! Why wouldn't you want a boy? Not that there's anything wrong with her, she's perfect, mate, but... You say it like it's a saving grace, like you've been... I don't know, like you've been... I don't know if it's all right to ask, or how to phrase what I want to ask. – Spared. – Yeah. Fortunately, I hadn't pissed him off again, 'cause Delroy's as sensitive as water. I have been spared. I have. The one thing you want for your kids is to have a better life than you. My dad, God rest his soul, always said that to me. With all the fucking bullshit in this country, all the jealousy, the back-stabbing, the apathy, the poverty, the hatred, the Black COVID death situation, that fat orange bastard in the White House, nah, fuck that! I'm chuffed she ain't a Black boy like me. That she didn't come out Black. 'Cause when you're big and Black... Nah, man... All the shit I've had to deal with. Blokes wanted to fight me all the time. All the shit with the police, women crossing the street from ya. The media, employers mugging you off on the regular. Nah, ain't no kinda life for no-one. I'll tell you what... I'm well chuffed. It was then I got it. Of course, George Floyd and seeing Black people triggered out of their skin this year has made me rethink. All the white guilt I've seen and felt has changed me. It has. I fucking hope it has. But, mate... To hear you say... ...you're glad... that you've not made a little you, a little Delroy. To see this great creation you've made with my sister as just some kind of piecemeal that nature, God, life has offered you. Bruv... It's made me understand ya. Overstand... how England has fucked you. – – Hard. - – For a long time. - – – What you gonna do? – This is my country, too. Don't ever think about having a brown kid. How you gonna make amends? – – You long streak of piss. Delroy, I love you like a brother, but you might sound like us, you may act like us, but you'll never be one of us. Anyways, er... Michael's gone Jack's. And... ...I'm home, trying to stem the evacuation. – – It's OK. Come on, it's OK, it's OK. Speak to Da... Yeah, yeah, er... Er... - OK, here... - I see. What's she been feeding you, eh? I says to her, paternal instincts brimming from me like cheese through a grater. No, no, no, like tiny flowers on a dandelion. What? I'm loved-up, bredren. It's all right. OK. Ssh, ssh. I thought, 'Was this brer for real?' I couldn't help myself. Right. That's it. Where was I going, eh? – – Oh, no. It's all right. It's OK. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here. I was gonna rinse out that eediat man upstairs, that's all. - – That's all. - – You see that with him? Michael? Nah, it's cool, it's cool. I guess it's, well, he got there, huh? Well, he thinks he reach anyway. I'm not sure that's a good thing. But maybe I'm to blame, too. Maybe I was a... I don't know. Maybe, maybe I was a coward, too. I mean, right from the off, when he, we were kids. But that's what this country does to ya, don't it? Our Great Britain. Makes you a coward, makes you weak. 'Cause it takes away your... your autonomy. And the little control it leaves ya, you ain't even sure how to use. I mean, he called my mum, when we were kids, he called my mum a 'Black bitch' in front of me, and I did nothing. Well, saying that, Mum didn't leave me any room to at the time. She marched him to his dad, Alan, marched him right up to his flower store to cuss him, and Alan for bringing up a son who could say such a thing. But I don't think we even spoke about what he said. The amount of shits that big elephant took in the room, and continues to take, and we say nothing. So, how could he fucking understand me if I didn't talk about it? Say it, be it. Me, that is. If I wasn't being authentic. How? - And now, look. - Look, he... He says he gets me. Funny what eight minutes 46 seconds can do. Yeah, what the internet can do. George 'I can't breathe' Floyd can do. Shit. I don't know shit any more. In lockup, like this. – – – My head ain't right. No... – - My head... My head... - My head... Ah! My head ain't right. I feel like I'm losing my centre. And the bad thoughts are... No, you don't wanna hear this stuff. You don't wanna come near. More like, I can't tell you this stuff because you'll think... Oh! I don't know what you'll think. But since this lockdown, yeah, I feel on the brink of something bad! All this not having time to be me, yeah? Do me – shop, go to bars, hang with mates, go to bars, pubs, the Orient. I mean, that's why we put up with being a work horse for this country, right? For these freedoms, these... these luxuries. I know they're luxuries. I watch Al Jazeera News. Sometimes. All right, not often, but I flick past it on the occasion. And I see the rest of the world grappling, fighting, squeezing the last drops out of our leftovers, relying on our laughable, trickle-down policies! But these are my rights, no? These pleasures. Our rights! Hands on top of your head. Hands on top of your head. Fuck, you know what I sound like? I sound like a fucking COVID denier. Oh, I just miss people, I think. Just fucking people, you know? Staring, looking at people. I never thought I'd miss people. Sharing stuff with people, ones I don't even like. Just fucking people. And I don't mean like I feel like I'm missing out, like when I was a kid, but I'm just missing staring at people. I'm a Londoner, innit? That's what's great about London, going to places where people congregate at, yeah? And I never knew I loved it, needed it. And my thoughts are just getting darker and weirder. Like, there's always another side, yeah, but you keep it in check, stay with the standard morality, the good side. But as my mum would say, there's a bad-minded side. And that side, the bad mind, just keeps getting into my view. So, check this, yeah? You know how if someone's not wearing a mask, and they're old, yeah, we should avoid them, right? Of course! Find them a mask, tell them to mask-up. Standard morality stuff. But... What if it's just meant to be? I know, I know, I know! Bad-minded! But what, who's to say this ain't nature's response to our bullshit? And it's just gone, 'Ere what, all the cancer, heart disease, 'leukaemia, dementia, tuberculosis, cirrhosis, it not working. 'These vain, ego-driven, fantasists, need a damn good culling. Hey! 'Bring out the COVID.' Pure bad-mindedness, but you feel me, right? I mean, 11 war zones have declared a ceasefire since corona. Emissions have dropped massively. Birds singing again. We can't say humanity don't deserve it. And as for the Black race, even though we know there's only one race, the human bloodclaat race, but when I look at the figures, I go, 'Shit man, God, nature must really hate the Black race, man.' I mean, what is it the news always says, oh, yeah, 'Disproportionately affected, ' like we ain't disproportionately affected in all the illness, all the hardships, all the poverty, with an education system holding all kinds of biases, police brutality? So we know who get licked the hardest when we come out of this pandemic. Sitting here with my daughter, knowing what's out there for her, even if she's not a Black boy like me. That's how I felt when it all went mental. When Michael left to go get the nappies. Yeah, this ain't getting any better. I ain't getting used to this shit! Even after what happened, 'cause this fucking COVID shit is going on forever. And when Michael left... Ugh! ..I started thinking like this. It all just got on top. Blood started boiling. I was like... Aaaagggghhhhh! Does God just fucking hate us? Just fucking hate Black people or something? Why is it always us? And then... She started to cry. That's it. That is fucking it. This brer is cruising for a bruising. Mi nuh joke! Come on, come on. – – And I... just stormed out of the flat. – – Full of rage. – ♪ La-da-da-ha ♪ La-da-da-ha ♪ La-da-da-ha ♪ Ha-ha... ♪ I feel like some Twitter millennial, cancel culture, outrage cockerel. You know the type, they's never been in a real fight, never had the real threat on their person, but has the anger, in however many characters allowed on Twitter, as a Palestinian suicide bomber. I kinda feel like them now. I just wanna shout expletive after expletive and bloodclaat expletive! – What happened? – What do you mean what happened? What? I'll explain myself more clearly, shall I? What the fuck happened? What ensued as a result of the action that took fucking place earlier on? – Is that clear enough for ya? – You tell me. Michael... Yeah. OK. I'll tell you what happened. I'm sure they'll be interested, too. Yeah, fuck it, let's get it out there, shall we? I've gone to Jack's. And you know I haven't been in there for like, well, since becoming an adult. And it feels like... feels like I've walked into Smurf world, – where everything's shrunk, – and a few shades away from grey. And sexy, it ain't. But it smells the exact same as it did when we come back from footy with Chris Driscoll and Brian Nichols, back in the day. Except it's empty. No-one's around until, well... You ever played hide and seek with a three-year-old and because they can't see you, they think you can't see them and the side of their body is blatantly in full view? – No. – Chief. Well, that there is how Jack looked behind the till. But, mate, he looked older than Methuselah. Like, face had more wrinkles than crushed silk, hair whiter than a dentist's coat and I don't know where his kids were, but he was just begging to get robbed blinder than The Blind Boys of Alabama. Must be the COVID restrictions or something. - – But, anyway... - – All my thoughts of cussing him evaporated when he poked his head around the till and said, 'Haven't seen you in a long while Michael. Would you like a Curly Wurly?' And winked a wink so devilish, Jack Nicholson would have bowed to it. He fucking remembered me! And all this time, he knew my fucking name. And what's more, knew I'd been nicking a Curly Wurly every time I went in there and never said nothing. Hey. Rites of passage. I couldn't speak. I went to the nappies, paid him, shaking my head in shame and disbelief. Then lifted my hands to shake his, to then remember my distance and just... ...wave at him instead. Like I'd seen an old flame on the bus driving past me. As soon as I get in downstairs, behind the fitty that lives on the third floor, I hear him popping off like a dud firework. Unpredictable and dangerous, dropping his best road-man bravura he was, though he's gotta work on his register a bit. Listen, blud. No budda mek enemy out of me. Then higher still for... Don't make me unload! Now, I know he's got a juvenile temper and a government-issued ankle chain making him look hot in the wrong way. So, I leg it up the stairs, making sure Miss Fit Ting sees me being athletic and get a post ♪MeToo unobserved ogle at her highly-toned posterior. As soon as I get on the landing... Straight off, I can see that it's on. You're on. It's about to go off with what can only be described as the kind of Brit even in the beginnings of Australia, Australians would've refused entry to. Even they would've sent him back on the boat, all the way around the Earth back to Britain, citing some new law preventing anyone as cunty-looking as that from getting in. So I think, 'Better calm this, now.' I go in all Martin Luther King, don't I? I gave it in a low, calm register. Brexit, COVID, everyone's skint and vexed. Delroy, check yourself, 'low it, man. Nah, man. Mans must be dizzy, blud. It's too late for dat now. Remember what Mrs Gupta used to say to us at school? 'The time is always right to do what's right.' I said, like some peacekeeping envoy. All I'm telling you is, keep both your bitches quiet. It wormed its way out of his thin reptilian lips like tear gas, which was the moment you went. I saw it in your eyes. I'd seen that look in your eyes before, at Orient, mainly. It was mainly saved for opposition fans or a shit referee. I'd only really seen that look when you knew it was kinda safe to let it all hang out. It was saved for then, weren't it? Saved for when you couldn't do much damage with it. Now, I don't know if you saved it all up week to week or if it was always in ya, but whoever was on the receiving end of it knew that anger would be unforgivable, unrenouncable and bloody deadly. He's right. He's fucking right. He's right. He's fucking right. What is it? In me? In men... No. Humans, in us. Why can anger rise so fully formed and indignant? And don't tell me about no evolution bullshit, 'bout when we had to kill to survive and that, 'cause we ain't had to do that from time. We're so comfortable, yet we're ready to bruk into war if we can't get sugar in our frigging tea. What is that? Why do we think rage is acceptable? How come we can't lodge that shit? I wanted to hurt him, but it wasn't just him. It was all the people who slighted me, all the fuckers who slight me on a day-to-day, week-to-week, year-to-year basis. Yeah, I found an outlet. He was my outlet. Like being at the Orient every time they give away a fucking two-goal lead. I wanted to hurt him because I'd lost words. I didn't have any more words, I was... I was bankrupt of words. We just didn't have the language. We lost words. So, I had a fit of anger that missed myself, missed me, went past me, who I want to be. See, I've grown where violence is the only way out of this kind of encounter. So... I went for him. And he swerved you and got a dig in. Your head snapped back and then he plaps, you jawed him. But he weren't for going down, was he? Fuck, no. So I jumps in, don't I? To stop it. You and I both know, many a time, I would have just laid into him as well, but I didn't, did I? I tried. I fucking tried. Guys, guys, you're neighbours! You don't need this kind of fuckeries. Come on, guys, stop, for fuck's sake! Like wrestling two hairless bears it was, but I did it, and felt good about it. You was breathing heavy, you were bringing up phlegm from the bottom of your lungs and that vein in the middle of your forehead was desperate to see air. I pulled him back from the guy who stood there like he should've been on a trophy. Got Delroy just out of earshot, but I wasn't far away enough. I was in earshot. I heard it, what he said about my niece, my flesh and blood. And after walking with her for just that short period of time, she'd become my responsibility, I weren't having it. He weren't saying that about my mate's kid, my sister's child. – My niece. – What did he say? Doesn't matter. What did he say? I've heard it before. Fuck, I might've even said it before. But I wasn't having it said now, or ever again. Not by him or no-one. So, I turned and went Goodfellas on his arse. I didn't even know I had that in me. I couldn't stop. Tears rolling down my face, fist crunching his jaw. Don't... You don't... Don't! Feet stamping on his fucking head! You don't fucking get to say that! You don't fucking say that! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't fucking say that! You don't fucking say that! And I watched you. Yeah. I let you. I stood and viewed you. And I felt fear, overwhelming fear. But not of what I might do, but what you might do. And I just seemed to root myself, stuck I was, rooted like a fucking tree! Filled with fear, fear like them soldiers on the beach at World War II the English never talk about. The ones laying on the floor in the foetal position, riddled with fear, waiting for the Sergeant Major to pull 'em out of the malaise. True talk. Never talk about that. Men filled with fucking fear. Never see that on Black Hawk Down or Dunkirk. Why couldn't I have met him with love? Answered his banging with some understanding? A smidgen of rahtid empathy. Why is it always anger? Why? Why not love? What are we teaching her? All this anger? What are we gonna pass on? I thought you changed your shit, sorted yourself out, with your... your yoga bird. Yeah, I was in AA and everything. - – But I split with her. - – Surprise, surprise. Yeah, it was all performative shit. I should've just bought a Benz, got a Rolex, and just tried to buy my adulthood instead. Would've been more me, huh? You know me, 'this' me. I ain't proud of it, man, but I smashed him up for you. I thought you'd be happy, maybe even a tad proud, maybe even a tad grateful. – Grateful? – Yeah. – Grateful? – Yeah, but you give me this, that look. What do you want from me? I'm not no... That's not what I want you to do for me. – But... – I don't wanna be saved. Do I look like I wanna be saved? Saved by you? I want you to stand with me, not for me! What the hell was that? We're supposed to be adults. – But he called her... – What? Oh... I don't wanna say it. – Don't let me say it. – Why? – I don't wanna own that word. – Why? 'Cause it makes me... Like, powerful? And I don't wanna feel powerful. You only care if there's some personal gain – literally, skin in the game. – Oh, come on, Delroy. – So fucking hypocritical. You don't really care. Now she's related, you care. – That's not true, mate. – Really? No. I was trying to save you from hearing that again. – I can't be saved by you, Michael. – I know. – We're not in some Harper Lee novel. – I know, but... That's like taking your rapist to court, and convicting him, and then having to suck him off on the way out to say thank you for admitting it. – I know. – You do? – Yes! – Fuck off, do you? All right. I weren't doing it for you! I was doing it for me. I needed to, Delroy. I was doing it for my own salvation, so I can sleep at night, so I can look myself in the eye. It's selfish, yes, but I can admit that. I know I can't save you or her but I can save myself. So I can die knowing I'm not like those muppets, or one of those deep-thinking, cashmere-wearing Liberals who, on the quiet, quite likes the setup 'cause they get the best seat in the restaurant, the best lamb cutlet. Or the fucker who thinks you got a bigger dick 'cause his favourite porn star loves the BBC and he hates the comparison, the competition. The type who thinks having a Black man as a boss in akin to being cuckolded. I know them, mate. I might've been one of them if you weren't my mate. So, yeah, I took advantage of the situation. Yeah, I wanted the race trophy. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you want to separate yourself from that? You see, you think we're all racist at heart. No, mate, it's worse than that. Most of us don't care. Not because you're Black, we just don't fucking care. And I wanna care. COVID has made me just wanna care, I think. Fuck, I don't know. Or... Michael, you just want to be the hero. Not for any other reason, not for me, not for the past, not to separate yourself, just so you can feel superior. Like some Trump supporter who fools himself that he's doing it for the flag or some Tory who's doing it for law and order. Tory? Back off! You voted for those cunts. You just want to be the hero of my story and yours. Real heroes go unseen. They go unannounced. – Yeah? Unsung. – Mate... It was my fight. Yeah? My honour to gain. My pride to boost. It was mine. Fuck, Delroy. I could hear her crying in the background. Wailing. – – Who are we? And that... with him upstairs, was just the beginning, because it was then that we met the Hackney Phantoms. – That's when tings got really real. – Yeah, tings went biblical on us. – The Hackney Phantoms! – Never in your life... Or our lives. ...have you have seen a more dangerous, angry, muscular, bruising or downright ugly bunch of fucking brers. – And they were coming. – They were coming for us. Fuck knows why. Why? We know why. 'Cause of him upstairs. Yeah, Trump. We called him Trump, 'cause he bleedin' well behaves like the cunt. Turns out he's the captain of their football team. – The Hackney Phantoms. – Yeah, you said that, Michael. Yeah, all right. Just making sure. Don't have a period! After the little slap he got from us, he must have gone crying to them. Weeping, more like. I'll bet you he was giving it... Boys, I need yer. I just got jumped by a couple of knife-carrying, liberal. Woolly, Antifa-loving, queer-fucking, cross-dressing, trans-loving, Corbyn-worshiping, Britain-hating, animal-loving, veggie-eating, fake news, woke-loving brers! You gonna let 'em get away with it? Who's with me? Follow me. I'm right behind yer. Whatever it was he said, he rattled their cage good. It was like hearing a herd of elephants coming up them stairs. They knocked on the door first, which I thought was kinda decent of them, – if not entirely pointless. – They didn't bang on the door for long. They must have had a hard-on this big to want to get to us. And they wanted us, no doubt about it. Yeah, it was white-boy day for them. And every single one of them boys, the Hackney Phantoms, was white. In case I didn't make that clear, yeah? Big and white. – How is that relevant? – I will tell you. Now, I can handle the regular type of white boys, you know, the leery, town centre, Ben Sherman types, who snort one line of Charlie, mixed kebab too many and a couple of Cobra beers, and who would, I swear to God, try and have it with a lamppost. - But, yeah, you know about that already. - My evidence? Here, exhibit A. I've never tried it with a lamppost. What do you take? Them type of white boys I can handle. I fight them. I can handle them, wipe the floor with them, but these boys, the brers were hardcore. And it's not just that they believe all that right wing, QAnon fake news conspiracy shit they read on Twitter, they're the ones who write that shit, 'cause they wanna believe it. It's not just their country they wanna take back or make 'great', it is they themselves that wanna believe it, be it. So, whatever gumpf neighbour Trump upstairs was giving them about us, they must have known it was bollocks, but they ain't interested in that. They ain't interested in nothing but taking us the fuck out. There you have it. They were in, and, Lord Jesus, fuck, they were big. Stop! What the fuck! All them moves I learned in boxing come into full use then. – Yeah. – Duck, duck, duck! No room for any jabs. I couldn't see an opening, they were so big, but I ducked all the same. They had nothing to say, just full-on rage. – I mean, fuck... – I mean, shit. It was getting silly. I mean, if you are gonna fight... What, you call that a fight? It was a massacre, carnage! I couldn't help but laugh, though. You were laughing? You were laughing at me? – Hear me out. – Chief! You with your jabs, trying to lay a glove on 'em. – What's your problem with that? – I don't have a problem with it. I'm just saying it was funny. There you were, all five foot 7 of ya. I'm five foot 9! A middleweight having it with a heavyweight! – I got that from Star Trek. – Come again? You heard me, I got that from Star Trek. – I think you'd better explain yourself. – I will. There's this one episode, yeah? Captain Kirk is on the bridge of the Enterprise. There's a Klingon Bird of Prey on the attack. Now, instead of trying to reason with it, as per his training, Kirk tells Scotty to fire torpedoes on his arse first. – And? – Don't you get what I'm saying? No, I don't. You are scaring me, however. Look, Kirk knew all about the Klingons. Knew what, Delroy? Where are you going with? The Klingons want a ruck 24/7. If you want to get their attention, give them a slap, a good one, enough to make them stop for a second and say, 'Is who diss?' Outta respect. So, you were Captain Kirk and the Hackney Phantoms where the Klingons? Capeesh. – Oi! Fucking hell! Fuck! Fucking hell! - – Fuck off! - No, you fuck off! Fuck off! Oi! Hey! Hey, back off! All right! Do you guys wanna stop a second? Come on, bruv. What is this? Do you even know why you're fighting us? – Turning my flat inside out? – You don't know me. Yeah? Don't you wanna know? You want to make up noise for the rest of your life? Never knowing? Never feeling? Unless you do, and judging by the arse-whipping you're trying to give us, you certainly do have beef. So, what is it? Huh? What? What'd he tell ya? What? White man losing his country? Hey, don't you dare! Don't you fucking dare! Don't you dare! If you're losing it, who's winning it? 'Cause it ain't us, yeah? So what is it? What? Rest of Europe? We're out of Europe now. You voted leave, I guess? Yeah, I voted leave. So we got what we wanted. We should be happy. If it's not that, then what? What'd he tell ya? Huh? Your mate? Your leader. – You ironed 'im out good and proper. – But that's between me and him. And me and Michael, the two of us, that's it. That's it. We didn't pile in there together or nothing. Is that what he told ya? 'Cause we didn't. Yeah? It don't need the whole team, does it? – Judging by your tops, team, right? – That's right, yeah. Hackney Phantoms. – He's our captain. – Oh. – Oh, come on, mate. Come on, where does this end? We get our boys involved? We can find you, easy. You can't hide. My baby was crying. Did he tell you that? And he got the arsehole because of that. 'Cause in his world, babies are not allowed to cry if it's in his earshot. That make sense? Or is it Black and brown babies are not allowed to cry? Which makes even less sense. They cry, they laugh, they shit. – Come on! – Come on, bruv! Let's not do this! Let's not do this. Let's think! For a minute, yeah? Just for a minute. Now, look at your mate's face over there. Look at him. Now, see his nose? I just did that for him and I will do it again. I will take out as many of you as possible. - – So will I! - – – You better believe! – I know there's more of you. But I will take out as many of you before you put me down. Do you want that to be you or are you gonna listen? Yeah? – – Now... Look. Look, look, look... I want you to just try and entertain the fact, try and entertain the possibility that you and me are the same underneath. And I don't mean ebony and ivory bullshit. I just mean that we think the same things. Yeah? We dream the same dreams. We have the same mistakes. I assume you like gals. You lot! You go on like you own the fucking place. This is my country, too. Hey! Hey! Hey! I was born in Hackney, for fucks! I've been here as long as you have. Anyway, where is he, then? Where is he? Why ain't he here? Backing you up, supporting you. Are you sure he's your mate, or someone who's just saying what you wanna hear? Making you feel what you've always wanted to feel just so you do shit for him? Come on. Be honest, 'cause look, er, he ain't here. Did he say he would be? Bruv, if the feds come, it's on you. - – Fuck it. - Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. – Bumbarass! Yeah, he, he thinks you're stupid. He thinks you're shit. He thinks he knows you. Does he know you? Huh? Look, yeah? If this is about the colour of my skin... say that. Own that, all of you! Is that what you think, deep down? Look, my baby was crying! Not a Black baby, not a white baby, a baby! Now ask yourself, would I be smashing up your yard if that was your kid crying? He's our captain. It's about fucking loyalty! He called my niece... his daughter, a baby, such... He called her... He used such language, right, such words I had to. I had to smack him. I fucking had to. Had to. If beating the granny out of us is gonna give you what you want, then do it. But deep down, I think you know it won't help. It just won't, yeah? It won't make you feel more powerful. It won't make your kids like you more. Better employment, better education chances, it won't. You'll finish beating us, and you'll realise you're in the same shit as when you started, yeah? Same as me. Same as we. But if that's what you really want... ...then take it, yeah? Bring it on. Do your worst. - – So, that's your little girl? - Yeah. Mine. Mine. My daughter. My baby. She screams like a pro. – Why? You got kids? – Mm. Yeah, I thought as much. – They good? – Mm. What, boy? Girl? Yeah, they're all right, innit? Kids? So, are we gonna do this or not? ♪ Never failing ♪ Love for you ♪ Oh, I forgot... Uncle Michael to the rescue. Pass me a spoon. And stop looking so damn smug. Oh, it's Carly. Answer it. Yeah. What? 'Kidnapping'? What're you...? 'Course she's all right, sis. She's with her favourite uncle, ain't she? What's the emergency? Yeah, well, she's my niece, ain't she? You told me to take her. I thought you could use the break. - – She's sleeping. - – Yeah, you wish. You ain't called the feds, have ya? All right... All right, don't explode. I'm only asking. What you talking about? It's not that late. Yeah. It ain't that cold. Wh... Look... Fear not, I will have her back in your loving arms before dark. Just chillax, will ya? Oh, you need to wash your mouth out, sis. Good and proper, sis. There's no need for that, is there? Yeah, when I'm done. Soon. I'll have her back soon. Five minutes. No, you stupid mare, I will leave in five minutes. I will not be back with you in five minutes. I will talk to you when I'm back on the road. When I'm on the road! Well, I will if you let me. All right, I'm going, now. Bye. Bye. Fucking hell, talking to her is like chewing on tinfoil, I swear. You have gotta go. In five minutes. I have my orders. - – She's well pissed-off. - – Is she? It's Carly. By the way, er... – We're working things out. – Sorry, mate? – We're working things out. – Ahh. That is good news. I hope you know it's on account of your beautiful, gorgeous, screaming kid why we're still alive, not 'cause of any of that bullshit you were spewing out. – Star fucking Trek. – What? I helped things a step. But, yeah, my little one helped. She's my kid, all right. – She is a Tomlin. – And a Fletcher. Yeah, plain as day. – Taken a good look at her? – 'Course! – Look again. – Why? I think you should. Look. Fuck off! Easy with the language. We got a kid here now. – That is Dad. – Yeah, I know. – That is bleedin' Dad. – So good you said it twice. – His mouth, she looks just like him. – I wouldn't go that far. How do you feel about that, mate? She's my daughter! Help me with this. I've got nothing but love and pride for her. – Stood? – Oh, yeah, mate. Good. 'Cause I don't want her learning any of your bad habits. – Scout's honour, mate. – They kicked you out of the Scouts. Mind my grief! – That was a distressing time for me. – You're not funny, Michael. – A little funny. – No, not funny. You used to laugh something rotten at my jokes. – Not any more. – Come on! Chin up, rude bwoi! – Stop it. – Stop what? – Just stop it. – What, making you laugh? – 'Cause you know I can. – Bwoi love himself. Oh, come on, Delroy. – Come on, what? – It's you and me, blud. – Don't call me that. – Always has been. – Whatever. – So, you know, you know that's true. – Nah, I'm just saying, whatever. – To what? – To the situation. – What situation? Oh, Jesus. This situation. You and me. – So you admit it. – Fucking hell. There is a you and me, always has. – All right. – All right, what? You and me. Always been a you and me, always will be a you and me. Shut yer damn mout'! And stop talking. If you were a sort, I'd marry you, mate. I don't need that image running through my head. – Yeah? Mind that thing. I am sorry, mate. – For what? – You know what. No, remind me. – Calling you out at Dad's funeral. – Cussing me, 'cause I voted Brexit? – Yeah, that. – Yeah. Telling me, a Black man, that I didn't belong? – Can we just park that? – No, I ain't parking shit. That car is staying running. You broke my heart, Michael. I know, and I'm sorry. I will never stop saying sorry. So now we got over that, we can start. Eh? That's a start. Something, innit? – Yeah, yeah. I suppose. – My man. Wait, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. – What do you mean by 'We can start'? – Our friendship, of course. We already have a friendship, as fucked up as it is. – I know. – So why say 'We can start'? – Nothing. – What do you mean by that? Start of what? – Don't matter. – Nah, it does matter. You're gonna tell me sooner or later. Come on. Let's have it. No, no, it's nothing. It's nothing. I know there's something else going on. Well, coming to think about it... I knew it. I knew there was something else going down. – All right, Columbo, power down! – So, you gonna tell me? – Money. – What? I need some money. – Come again? – Money, Delroy. Pieces of paper with the Queen's face on 'em. – Are you shaking me down? – Well... Is that what this is? A fucking shakedown? – That is one way of putting it. – So, you bring my kid over... – Bring no end of grief. – Del... Just so you can fleece a few quid off me? Del... – – Where's my wallet? How much? How much this time, you liberty-taking, fool-arse wretch? – How much? – 90 grand should do it. What in the name of Leyton fucking Orient have you been smoking? – Let me explain. – 90 grand? You're winding me up. I'm waiting. What is the one thing my dad always dreamed about? Rights for whites. I'm sorry. – Aside from that. – I don't blasted know. – Yes, you do. – He was your dad. The best flower seller in the whole of the East End. – If you say. – I do say. And? I just gave you the mother of all clues, Delroy. What, his own shop? Be a proper florist? That's it, Del, my boy. – But he's dead now, so what's it matter? – It matters to me. Well, go and buy one then, gwan. What do you think I'm asking you for 90 grand for, you sap? Get the fuck out of here. – Hear me out. – No, I won't. Get the fuck. Riz is getting out the property business. – Who the fuck is Riz? – My friend. Dad's friend. – Your dad? – There's more. Riz sounds Asian. You telling me your dad was friends with an Asian? I couldn't believe it, either. – You said there was more. – Anyhow, this Riz owns a couple of shops – next door to each other on Hermit Road. – Where your dad's stall was. Yeah, Riz owned the plot. I never bleeding knew. – But you do now. – Yeah. Walking up there with her... ...got me thinking. About legacy and that. Now, I ain't got kids, mate. – I can't see it now, and... – And? All right. She's... I only... When I die, it's hers. Whatever is mine is hers, mate, innit? – I don't... – It's hers. Riz wants to sell up. This lockdown's killing him. Fucking him left and right, truth be told. And here it comes. He's letting me have the properties at a discount, a fucking big one, mate. – So you need 90 grand? – 330, as a matter. But Riz ain't the only one having it on his toes. Mum's off to Majorca as soon as she's allowed. She's selling the house and will give us the money to buy the florist. – Well, nearly all the money. – I see. It's what he always wanted, Del. – Is that violins I can hear? – Another 90 I need, and it's mine. - – Ours, if you want it. - – It's what we always talked about. – Did we now? – Well, yeah. – A couple of questions here. Bear with. – Sure. Right. First... On what planet do you think I've got 90 grand lying around? – Your mum does. – You want me to give my mum a shake? No harm in ask. So you can buy a shop in memory of your racist dad? Mum has a wicked sense of humour, Michael, but she don't need a laugh that bad. Come out. You said once that she had some money lined up for you, insurance, held back from when your dad died. But she can get it now, if she wanted, or... she had a few bob in the house that could... Why would she? Which brings me to question number two. – What's question number two? – Why would she? Because you asked her to. – Why would I? – A couple of questions, you said. Now is not the time to get renk with me, Michael, believe that. 'Cause I can't think of anything better, Delroy. Me in my shop, selling flowers. You in yours, next door, but on the same plot. Us, together. It could be a caff, selling your mum's hot Jamaican patties. Imagine it. You and me, side by side, in business, together. Shouldn't be happening. But it is happening. - – Look at her. - – We're tied now, forever. Your history is our history. - – Exactly. - – Oh... This little one... ...is our future now. The future of both our families. What a legacy we can give her. – She's the perfect sign. – Sign? Vision. Future. Legacy. For fuck... She's the future. Our future. – – Oh. Come out of my yard, is what I should be saying. – But you're not, are you, Del? – This is nuts! – Del. – It's stupid. It's off the charts! Maybe, but you ain't saying no. There's gotta be a part of you that wants this. Your mum always wanted a caff. This is her chance. Your chance, my chance, Carly's chance, the baby's chance. We can put it all behind. Level playing field. It's what you want, it's what I want. It should be what the whole bleeding country wants. Say something, mate. Say anything, except no. Is that a yes? Hm. Hold your horses. Come on, yeah... Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah... I need to run it past Mum. And Carly, your sister, in case you've forgotten. – Does she know about this? – Not a jot. Yes. So? So... We'll see. Beautiful. That is what you will see, Delroy. – Beauty. – Yeah. We'll get out of this fucking pandemic, and you'll see what a beautiful thing this is – beautiful, Delroy, I'm telling you. – We'll talk. – I love you, Del. – You know that, right? – Don't you dare try and kiss me. You love me, too. You know that. You got the melt for me, good and proper. Fuck off! Don't make me hurt ya. - – Go halves on the refurb, yeah? - – – – – Oh, this girl! – She's your sister. Yes, Carly, leaving now. Right out the door as I speak. Well, no, not immediately right now, on account of I had to stop and talk to you. Now. Leaving. Now. Right now. Right now. Just get her home, will ya? I'm on it, Chief. Dad's mouth. Can't believe. So, you'll talk to your mum? Her people will talk to my people? – My people will talk to her people... – Michael, we'll talk. And... thank you. For bringing her. It's all good, mate. We can do this. Carly? Yeah, you got my text, then? Well, she's gorgeous. Er, well, yeah, it's been, er... It's been hell of a day. Yeah, I'll let Michael tell ya. No, no, he just left. Yeah, look, he asked me. Yeah. Yeah, he went all around the block like you said he would, but... He asked me. Yeah, I should've strung him along a bit, but he was so pathetic going on about legacy and shit that I couldn't bring myself. Listen, are you sure about this? With the shop. You, me, Mum, him. Yeah, I am, if you are. No, it's all good. It's all... Babe, it's all good, yeah? We can do this. We're gonna do this. Yeah. So, er... What are we gonna call her?
