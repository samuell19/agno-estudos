Oh, please, Mr. Wiz, you just gotta help me get back to Kansas. I don't gotta do anything. The great Wiz does as he pleases and nothing more! Oh, no, sir! You don't gotta do nothing at all. But would you? Tell me, where did you get such a marvelous pair of silver pumps? I can do this. I can do this. - What's going on? - I can't do this, Mr. Gribble. - What are you talking about? - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, everybody. I let you all down. Marc, forget about those people, they're chorus. Just tell me, what's the matter, buddy? - Okay. Okay. - Breathe. I know you said to try to tie it to a balloon and let it go, but... Okay, breathe. First of all... Hello? It's okay. It's okay. Breathe. Tickle the esophagus. - Come on. Come on. Center up. - I'm trying. I can't do it. - Marc! Marc! You can. Yes, you can. - I can't. And do you know why? Listen to me. Do you know how I know? Because you've got this. A great costume? No! Heart. Tin Man didn't have one. But you do. A big one. It's the reason I gave you this part. Okay? - It is? - Yes! Come on, you're Marc Pease. You're the most dependable performer I've got. You're a leader. You set the bar so the other kids can go beyond it. - I do? - Yeah. And, by the way, you happen to be the founder of Meridian 8. Only the hottest high school a cappella group ever! - Really? - Yeah. Really. And when you make your first album I would love to have the opportunity at a shot at producing it. - Really? - Please? - Okay. - Okay. Good. Now you get out there and you sing the crap out of that song, just like you did in rehearsal. Okay? All right? All this stuff you're feeling, all that terror and fear and that weird thing underneath your stomach above your pelvis, that's show business. Okay? All right? That's what we're all about, guys like you and I. That's what's running through our veins. What is? Pizzazz! Tin Man, do you know anything or not? Hey! Marc! - Who was that? - That was the Tin Man? You dropped your ax, buddy! Marc! Marc! You can still make it back for the winged monkeys! Hello? Hello? Is this it? Okay. Yeah, no, no, I like it. Good morning, students of New Ashby High School. This is the all-powerful Gribble speaking. I've taken over these morning announcements to deliver a very important reminder. It is opening night. This very evening, New Ashby High's prestigious Drama Club presents The Wiz! Directed by, that's right, yours truly. I feel like I should have been Dorothy, you know, like... I have a better voice than her, don't I? Yeah! Thank you! She's just loud. Like, we can hear you. Great. I can scream, too. Right? Like, thanks, Celine. No, I'm totally, like, totally, totally quitting singing. No, wait until I tell Marc. Maybe his ponytail will burst into flames. Very few tickets remain, so I would advise you to skip first period and rush on down to the box office where the one and lonely Robby Bender is sitting there twiddling his thumbs, waiting for you to buy a ticket from him. Isn't that right, Robby? Thank you! Thank you! Yes! All right, this next song goes out to my beautiful girlfriend, Meg Brickman, a little shiny diamond... Hi, hi, hi. No, no, I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. No, I have an airport run and then I'm picking up my lady. So what's the news? They make an offer? I think this is a day for the entire community to be proud of. Even you, computer lab support team who have no personalities. Joan! You are the greatest realtor in the universe. I'm meeting with the group this morning. They're gonna freak out when I tell them the big news. Yes! Okay, I'll be here by noon. All right. Okay, bye. You guys, we're doing it. So, if you're walking in the halls and you see someone you know who's involved in the play tonight, give them a pat on the backpack. Or a high five. Or just say hi. Even if it's a stagehand or an usher, make them feel like they're important. - Marc's here! - Okay. - Sorry I'm late. - Why are you driving this? Client's flight was delayed. No time to switch cars. Wow! What a morning! It's gonna be a very special show. Quite possibly, the greatest high school production of The Wiz ever staged. Let's do this thing! I will destroy you! Nice cap. Focus. Focus. - So, Meg. - Yeah? - I think you better buckle your seat belt. - Why? - Because I've got huge news. - What? I'm finally getting the group into the recording studio. - Somebody's buying the condo? - Yes. Yes! Joan's bringing the buyers over today to take a final look. Okay, this is gonna bring in all the cash we need to make a kick-ass demo. Yeah, but, Marc, what's the point? There's only, like, four of you left. It's stupid. - How can you say that? - I'm sorry. Forgiven. - That's really exciting. - Yeah. - I love you so much. - Me, too. Bye. - What are you doing? - I have to run inside and talk to Gribble. - Why? - To tell him the big news. No one even knows I put the condo on the market yet. I'll tell him. - No, no, no, no. - Marc, come on. Hey, I'll just be five, all right, Pascal? - Take your time, Marc. - Okay. I can't believe I have to take these stupid Milford kids to their prom tonight. - And what if I'm late for your show? - It's okay. Bye. What are you typing on your computer? Where have you been hiding? It's been months. I'm a busy guy. I heard Rob Gentry quit the group. Doesn't matter. I'm working on something now that will keep Meridian 8 together forever. - Is Gribble around? - No. It's opening night. What did you expect? I need that. Don't steal it. I will. Yes, this is Debbie. Yes. Vice Principal Yonka, that's correct. 2:45 is fine. He's gonna be so psyched. Why don't you call me back when you know when you're available? Bye, Debbie. Perfect. Hey. Oh, hey. Cory. How's your sister? Meg. Can you give me a hand with this, please? Thanks. So I heard you lost another member of Meridian 8. Yeah. So what are you guys now? Meridian 5? Four, actually. Don't you think you should change the name of the group? What? Never. Cory! Do you want help? Not a word of this. Here and now, it's time for celebration - I finally figured out - Yeah, yeah That all my dreams have no limitations - That's what it's all about - Come on, now! Everyone is special in their own way - We make each other strong - We make each other strong - We're not the same - We're different in a good way Together's where we belong Sell it! We're all in this together Once we know that we are We're all stars and we see that I ain't buying it. Come on. I need more, tenors! We're all in this together Good! And the clap! And it shows when we stand hand in hand Make our dreams come true Big finish! Together! All right! Good. Good. Much better. Sopranos, measure 38, still getting that F sharp sort of sneaking up on you like... It's not a surprise. It's gonna be there, right? Let me hear that. Support it. Come through here, through the mask. Okay? I can't do it, but you can. Okay. Kenny! Was I imagining it, or were you actually singing with us today? Your lips were moving and sound was coming out. Glad to hear your voice. It's a welcome addition. Okay, for those of you performing in tonight's show, please, I implore you, warm up your voices. Do the Circle of Fire, do The Escalator. You're going to be kicking yourselves if you don't. Okay? And I'm gonna be sitting in the cheap seats, so each and every one of you needs to make sure that I hear your voice. That goes for you, Hazel. You, Brendan. You, Meg. Everybody's got to remember that tonight is for reals. Stakes couldn't be higher. So if you get out there on stage and you feel a little jittery, like maybe you want to pass out, it happens, don't panic. It's no secret that the last time we did The Wiz, my Tin Man, who shall remain nameless, broke down crying in the middle of his big song. And that was it. Don't let what happened to Marc Pease happen to you. Say you do remember dancing in September? Never was a cloudy day! All right! Thank you! Thank you! This next song goes out to the truly brilliant Jon Gribble. The greatest man I've ever known. Butter, butter, butter, butter, butter, butter, butter, butter! Clear crumbs, clear crumbs. Crumbs, be gone! - Hey! Mr. Pharmaceutical Salesman. - You're late. - Sorry. - I let two buses go by. I owe you 10 minutes of your life back. Today's insane. I had a 5:00 a.m. airport pick-up, and the flight was an hour late. Meg almost missed first bell. - My boss! - You're not gonna answer it? No way. Let's go! I'm going back over to Meg's later, and making her dad help me move that piano into her bedroom. The acoustics will be way better in there. Exactly. So they've asked for a '70s medley. - Cool! - Yeah. I'm gonna slip in the Tin Man song, too, in honor of Meg's opening night. - Really? - Sure, why not? - Marc... - What? - The Tin Man song? - Yeah! That song kind of has a lot of baggage. Baggage is meant to be unpacked, my friend. Do you remember the lyrics? Gerry, it's The Wiz. I know every single line in that show. - Go ahead, test me. - Hey, Marc. But, Marc, why even put yourself in that position? What? You think I'm going to start crying and run off stage like I'm still in high school? Well, I won't! - Lazy day, lazy day. - There he is. Right! - Marc Pease was here? - Yeah, he tried to steal my pen. Did he cry when you took it back? Give the kid a little friendly encouragement when he's 16, and he never leaves you alone. I mean, I never return his calls. And when I do, I use my curt voice, but he just keeps coming back, like a bad case of mono. You can only get that once. - Okay, herpes or whatever. - Lyme disease. So what does he want with you now? He wants me to produce a demo tape for his a cappella singing group. He brought it up a few months ago, when he waited by my car for me for two hours after school, in the faculty lot, in the pouring rain. Excuse me. What was that? What was that? I switched up to the 7th. That was Rob's part. - I said I'd cover us there. - I keep forgetting to stay on the alto part. Then maybe we should rework the arrangement. No way, man. We don't just start tinkering. Right? So I can't even believe this is our first gig in nine weeks. Are you guys psyched or what? I don't know. You don't know? What do you mean you don't know? Well, I've been feeling a little bit lately like we've kind of lost some of our luster. - Lost our luster? - I basically agree. What is this? Am I the only one that cares about this group anymore? - What? - Come on, Marc. Come on. No, you come on, Gerry. I mean, it's a very simple question. Are the rest of you wholeheartedly committed to a cappella vocal music? Yes. - Yes what? - Yes, we care. I know you do, Mizz Thang. And you should, because we are world-class, you guys. Am I right? Isn't that why Gribble brought us together in the first place? Did he not say that we were the best? - In high school! - He says it to everyone, probably. Not true. - Marc, what is your point here? - My point is... Okay. Enough. I was gonna tell you later, but you're forcing my hand. About what? It was supposed to be a big surprise. What is it? We're going into the recording studio. - No! - Can you believe it? With what money? - What money? - I'm selling my condo. That is astounding! - Gribble will be our producer, of course. - Yes! He'll see us through the whole process... - Gribble! ...the vocal arrangements, everything. His friend Jimmy Zapparini over at Isle of Sound? Best sound engineer in the business. He'll be recording us. This is real. - Is Gribble psyched? - Of course he is! You guys, this is it, okay? This is what we've been working so hard for! - I don't believe this. - It doesn't seem real! So now do you guys want to talk about today's gig or what? - Yeah. - Yeah! Scarecrow is a bigger part, but Gribble wanted me to play the Wiz because of the final number. Said he needed someone he could trust to bring it home. What drew you to Marc Pease? - What do you mean? - Was it his ponytail? - I'm serious. What was it? - I don't know. I think it was fate. 'Cause he says that the first time he ever saw me he, like, knew that I had this beautiful singing voice. Like, somehow he sensed it. And then when I did sing for him, he was, like, totally blown away. What a sweetie. But lately he's, like, obsessed with his group and he doesn't pay any attention to my singing at all. He's just a big dork. Bring up dimmer 32. Okay. Big day. How goes it? Am I going to have to have my name taken off the program? The winkies are magenta. Where is Derek Schmidlin? There was an emergency at home. - There was an emergency at home? - Yeah. Hey! - No, no, no, no! What are you doing? - Painting. You're dripping all over the turntable. You're splattering the turntable. Sorry. Don't be sorry. Be mindful. If you're gonna open a can of paint, put a drop cloth underneath it. All right? If you're gonna hang a Leko, you attach the proper safety cord. You see a glue gun lying on the stage. What do you do? Pick it up. You have got to have respect for the theater. It all starts here. It all starts with that vacuum cleaner. I don't know if anybody heard, but Derek Schmidlin went home because he had an "emergency." In my experience, the kind of person that goes and leaves a vacuum cleaner unattended in the aisle is not the person we see at the Tony Awards in 15 years. You've all worked so hard to get to this point. Right there. Let's not let it go to waste, okay? I have a private. Try to pick up the pace a little. Okay. - You don't want to eat lunch with me? - I have to sing. Not that there's much point. I mean, I'm 18 years old, this is my fifth straight show in the chorus. Well, imagine where you'd be without the lessons. Okay. Here we go again. Into her bedroom. No. I think we're gonna need a new approach here, Mr. Brickman. Yeah, I know. There, you've got it moving there. Good luck finding any room in there. What a disaster. Shoulders back, big, deep breath. Ningee. Good. Drop the jaw. Nay-yay. That's right. Good. Poobah. You've got to drop your jaw and open your mouth, all right? Open your mouth. Relax. Just take a big deep breath. Shake it out. Wah-bo. Okay, Meg, I am pleased to report that you have got the gift. But without practice, you got the gab. I know. I know. - I like to talk. - Okay! This is dirty. This is dirty. March, April, May. Smooth the pillow. And you sleep here. And we tuck it. Thank you. How you feeling about tonight? What's this? I don't know. Come on, I'm the one who should be nervous. My reputation is in the hands of a bunch of flakes. What? You think a guy like me doesn't get nervous? Huh? I don't know. Hang on a second. I want to show you something. Hey, Jon Gribble. It's Marc "The Man With The Big News" Pease calling. I know you're just finishing up with Meg. You must have turned your cell off. She better not have spilled the beans. Anyway. I didn't want to have to tell you this in a message, but... You know what? Just call me back, I'll tell you later. All right. Okay. Bye. Love like a road that never ends How it leads me back again to heartache I'll never understand Darling, I put my heart upon a shelf till the moment was right and I told myself Next time I fall in love I'll know better what to do Next time I fall in love The next time I fall in love The next time I fall in love Is this you? Pretty hot, huh? You look really young. Is that so hard to believe? Hey, Meg, you have an absolutely beautiful singing voice. You realize that, right? Thanks. Why are we laughing? - Just... I don't know. - I don't know. It's, like, so funny. I mean, every time you sing for me, I just... I thought you said we couldn't anymore. Did I? Next time I fall in love The next time I fall in love The next time I fall in love It will be with you Okay. That was beautiful. Thank you. You are beautiful. - Thanks, Jon. - You're welcome, Meg. Why are we laughing? Because we shouldn't be doing this? Meg, Meg. Meg. Oh, Meg! Oh, God! Oh, God, Meg, you taste like marshmallow. - Is that a good thing? - That's a very good thing. Okay. - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My watch. - No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. Oh, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg. - You got it. - There? Oh, yeah, right there. - Yeah. Oh, right there. - Like that? Just like that. Here I am! Here I am! - Ever want to ride a kangaroo? - Make kanga juice, too? Stand up and holla when you cuddle a koala? Get the lowdown and walk upside down? - It's nice, isn't it? - Well, matey... Fourth bell. You missed fourth bell. - That's okay. Here you go. - Thanks. My pleasure. Okay. Hey, Meg, you know I think you're terrific, right? I mean, I'm such a big fan. You know that, right? I mean, it's just, we can't... We can't do this again. I mean... You forgot to even sign this. Bottom right. Sorry. I missed fifth period, Ancient Civilizations. I saw Marc this morning. He's so much fun. Do you think I'm a good singer? I've never heard you sing. Yeah, because I'm always in the chorus. And everybody keeps saying that that doesn't mean anything, but it does mean something, right? It means that I'm not that good. Well, do you like singing? - What do you mean? - Do you enjoy doing it? Do I enjoy doing it? Hello, Marc. You remember Rick. And this is his father, Benny. We've come to show him the condo. Okay. - Okay. - Come on. - I just love the feel of this place. - This was Grandma's room. You have to see the closet. It's a big closet. This window faces east. Casts a nice morning light. And this is where I've slept every night for the past 21 years. Are the neighbors quiet? Oh, yeah. Most of them are very, very old. - This from high school? - Yeah. You've had that ponytail a long time. You've reached Marc Pease Limited, offering professional limousine services and the Meridian 8 experience. Leave a message and I'll get back to you in 4/4 time. Hey, Marc. Jon Gribble returning. I'll try you back next week. Okay? Bye-bye. Stick that. Stick it. Yeah. This going inside? Good. Yeah, all right!

Back to work! Marc, I think it's going really well. - Grandma took me in, Joan. - Yes, I know. I know. Now I'm supposed to just sell the place right out from under her? Well, I think she'd want you to move on. Don't you? Who said anything about moving on? I just want to make a demo with my group, that's all, before anyone else leaves, you know? Why is that so hard? He loves it. - That's terrific. - That's very fast, right? How much time do you need to get out of here? - Well, I'm not sure... - I think Marc is planning on renting, so it shouldn't take much more than a month, isn't that right? - I've got to get to my gig. - Gig? - Marc's a singer. - Yeah, I sing. Oh, crap! Marc! "The mud on my sneakers dries up like fecund grout "and I can clear the treads with a twig. "Then I smile to myself because I am living." Beautiful, Jeff. Very strong sense of the physical world. Thanks, Mr. Edwards. Okay. Does anybody else want to read their in-class exercise? Meg Brickman. Great. "The brown-eyed baker frosts me cold with his icing. "I am his strawberry shortcake. "I lick the sweetness on my lips. "My eyes spit fire! "He slices through me with his sharp knife, "and I tear the skin off his face, laughing blood." This lotion has changed my life. Why does Marc insist on doing the Tin Man song today of all days? He'll be fine. He's a rock now. Every time I think of that night, I get the shivers. Yeah. Gives me diarrhea. - Gross! - Don't be so squeamish. - Speak of the Pease. - Here I am. - Let's do it! - Do it! - Do it! - Do it! - Do it! - Do it! - Do it! - Do it! Do it! So, what was that guy's name over at Isle of Sound? Jimmy Zapparini. Zapparini! Does he know about us yet? So when do we start prepping with Gribble? - You know what? I'm not sure. - Soon, I hope. - He must be so proud of us. - Yeah. - Did you get the keys to the Taurus? - No, I didn't. - Hey, is everything okay? - Yep. Come on, let's bust a move, guys. Come on. Circle of Fire. Bring it in. Where are you? Okay. Let's have a good show. I first heard these young people last year at the opening of the Fifth/Third Bank downtown. I know you're going to enjoy them. Meridian 8! We are Meridian 8! - One! - Two! - Three! - Four! Do you remember the 21st night of September? Love was changing the minds of pretenders While chasing the clouds away Say do you remember dancing in September? Never was a cloudy day I was born in the wagon of a traveling show My mama used to dance for the money they'd throw Papa would do whatever he could - Preach a little gospel - A little gospel Sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good Gypsies, tramps and thieves We'd hear it from the people of the town, they'd call us Gypsies, tramps, and thieves And every night all the men would come around and lay their money down What would I do if I could suddenly feel And know once again that what I feel is real? - I could cry - Cry - I could smile - Smile - I might lay back for a while - While - Oh, tell me what - What would I do If I could feel? What would I do If I could reach inside of me And know how it feels To say I like what I see? You're a rich girl but you've gone too far 'Cause you know it don't matter anyway You can rely on the old man's money You can rely on the old man's money It's a bitch, girl But it's gone too far 'Cause you know it don't matter anyway Say money, but it won't get you too far, get you too far Don't you know Hey, you. Just stay focused on the big picture, right? - You know what that is? - The recording studio? - That's right! - Yay. We're so ready for this. All right, come on, let's go. Demo! - Marc? - Okay! You were right. Okay? I shouldn't have done it. It's all right. I know, it's just a song. It's a stupid song. Maybe you should just never sing it again. I've really got to jam, Ger. Will you at least tell me what Gribble's plan is? - Gribble. - Yeah. What about him? Well, does he really think we can pull it off? - Absolutely. - Tell me what he thinks. Well... Well what? Well, I haven't exactly made contact with him yet. - What? - Not yet. Not yet. So he doesn't even know about the condo? No. But we've talked about the demo, like, a gazillion times. - He's the one that gave me the budget. - Jesus. Everything's all right, Gerry. I promise. - Marc, we can't do this without Gribble. - I know that! I'm going to talk to him tonight. Face to face about this. I swear to you, when I tell him that we're ready, he's going to jump at the chance. - And if he doesn't? - He will. Because I'll do whatever it takes. I will not let this group down, Gerry. I promise you, I'll pay him $50,000 if I have to. I'll sell my voice to the Devil. - But... - Don't worry about Gribble, Gerry! I will take care of him tonight, okay? This next song goes out to... Yeah. I'll be all over the place, as you can imagine. But don't worry, you shall not be neglected. I know it's no picnic being the director's date. So, yeah, give me a call if you think you might be able to make it. I'll just reserve you a seat right next to mine, and instruct the usher to let you slip in any time. I'm really looking forward to meeting you, Joyce. Bye. Good evening, madame. Is Mr. Craig Lipscomb present? Craig! Limo's here! My name is Marc, and I'll be your chauffeur this evening. And what is the name of the young lady who will be joining us? - Jen. - Jen. Fantastic. Those are from Marc. - Be careful. - Don't tell me what to do. Just slow down. There are like forty thousand crows behind you. - Hurry up. - All right! I'm going as fast as I can! God! Whoa there, tornado dancer. I'm only doing this because of Marc. He's the one who says I'm a singer. But he doesn't know. He doesn't know who I really am. Who are you? I don't know. Neither does he. Done. Move it. You forgot my shimmer lipstick. - Nice. - So cute! You guys look great. Really nice. How about one of the driver bowing to me? - Let's get a picture of that. - All right, all right, I will. - That's good. Nice, Craig. - Oh, yes! Oh, my God. That is gonna be awesome. Okay. I'm gonna try to keep this short, folks, so we can all do what we need to be doing. So I'd appreciate your full attention. Bryce? Hello. Thank you. Okay, just some final thoughts before tonight. How's everybody feeling? - Good. - Good. Wiz. Where are you, bro? - Right here. - All right. On Y'all Got It? I need it funkier. Okay? "Y'all got it?" Really call it out. And you're calling it out to everybody. They're gonna come right back at you with the energy that you give to them. Then you lay it out, and then you go for it, and have fun. All right, everybody. Permission to have fun tonight. And that goes for all the Emerald City people. Okay? You guys, you've got to step up and have some fun. I know you've got it in you. I was at Janine's party, too. Addaperle, lose the second snap when you put down Dorothy, okay? Just give me one, boom! You put Dorothy down with that. That's right. Erica. Could you get me a Diet Coke, please? All right. Okay. Scarecrow. I need more straw coming out of your sleeves, Brendan. Right? More, more, more, more, more. Never enough straw. You think it's too much straw, it's not enough. Because that helps this so much. Good stuff. Yes, right, this is important. Cathy. Tania. Sorry. During the twister, don't just kick your feet up like you're slipping on some slippery ground, okay? This goes for all the tornado victims. You are in a class five, okay? This is for real. If the tornado dancers are twisting their ribbons and creating this wonderful illusion, and you're standing there like you're waiting for the cross-town bus or something, that's not gonna work. Okay? Remember we watched The Storm Chasers? This is what the research was about. You guys have to be caught up in that wind. Okay, what else? Bag? What bag? Okay. So, I have a little announcement. According to Stephanie, we're sold out. You're a hit already. Don't screw it up. Take a breath. Close your eyes. Think about what you're about to do. Put it all in a balloon. Let it go. Let it float up to the sky. It's okay. You know why? Y'all got it! Look at me, everybody. Yeah! Number one! Right here. Craig Central. Yes! It's all me! Hey, guys! Do you guys like Milford? It's all right. So what kind of shows you guys got going on over there? Teachers suck. Teachers suck over at Ashby, too! That's strong. There's this one guy over there, Jon Gribble. Have you ever heard of him? Watch this. What are you gonna do? Oh, my God, again? Now listen to me! I've had a very, very bad day! And if you pull my hair one more time, I might... I might crash this car into that gas station! Is that what you want? - Is that what you want? - No. Do you want to die with me in a giant gas explosion? No. Christ! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! Help! Comin' to get'cha Help! One, two, three. Comin' to get'cha Comin' to get'cha Get'cha Get'cha Get'cha Okay, here's my card. When you're ready to go, call that number. I'll swing around and toot. - Okay. - Have a great prom! - Say, girl, what's your name? - Dorothy. Where you headed for? To Emerald City. There's this great big, powerful Wiz and they say he can do miracles, so he's gonna get me back to Kansas. Hey, you know what? Of course not. I don't know anything.

I know how it is. Sometimes a parent can do everything right and still the kid ends up troubled. But he thinks the world of you. Well, that's because I pay him to say that. - No, he's a good kid. - He is. Hey, Mr. Carnegie-Mellon! Hey. - Hello. - Hey. - Hi, I'm Jon Gribble. - How are you? Hey! Gribble! Hey! I will see you guys. Okay? Gribble! Hey! Hey, Gribble, whoa, whoa, whoa. Marc Pease! There he is. I've been trying to reach you like crazy. - Have you? - Yes. Well, here I am. This looks familiar. Yeah. Hey, Marc, not the best time. What do you need? Well, I've been really thinking about something. Something kind of big, you know? About how in life, or whatever, - that there's this moment... - Yeah. ...right, and you don't know when it's gonna happen, but you've just gotta be ready for it. Ready to jump in. Take the plunge, you know? So... I'm doing it. - Which one? - What? Jumping or plunging? I'm kidding, Marc. I'm kidding. I've got to get inside. My show's opening right now. - I know. I'm sorry, I just... - And it's going really well, so... Okay? - But... - It's great. I'm very happy for you. Okay? - No, but there's more! - Yeah, I know, but I've got to... - I haven't... - I've got to get inside! But I haven't told you... Dude? What the freak? - What the freak? - What? - Haven't you talked to Gerry? - No. They've made him lead rosacea man. In Dayton. - He's moving? - He's quitting. He's out of the group. - Gerry. - You know what else? He said he called the Isle of Sound today and they told him Jimmy Zapparini hasn't worked there for six years. He was fired for stealing. Gribble lied to us. Oh, my God. What are we gonna do, Marc? Tracey's been crying all night. We're done. We'll talk after. So I snuck out for a clove and guess who I saw? - Who? - Marc Pease. Great. I hope he's happy. I'm making a complete fool of myself. Hey, Gerry. It's me, Marc. Gavin told me that you... That... What would I do If I could suddenly feel? And know once again that what I feel is real? God damn it! I could cry, I could smile And I might lay back for a while And there, maybe, after a while I might see a baby smile And I'd notice how she would grin After I had touched her chin And if a tear came to her eye - Marc! - We need to talk. - I'm watching the show. - It's urgent! Yeah, well, it will have to wait, okay? No! That's for Joyce! That seat's reserved. Marc! I'm waiting. Go away. - Maybe if you returned my calls... - Please be quiet. Bravo! We have to talk! - No, you shh! - Hey! Let's go. Stop it! So you wanted to meet the Wizard! Okay. Here we are. What is it? Come on, Marc. Come on! You brought me here, remember? I thought you might want to know that I'm selling my condo. That's great. Great. Great news. Aren't you gonna ask me why? I don't know, you're worried about the housing bubble? I was selling it to pay for Meridian 8 to go into the recording studio, - just like you always said we should. - Did I? You know you did! No, Marc, I said you could do it, not should. There's a big, big difference. No, no, you told me that if we ever went into the recording studio, that you would be our producer. You said all I had to do was get the money! - Okay, would you calm down? - No, you calm down! - Marc. - What? I never dreamed you'd come up with that kind of cash. Then why did you say it? It was my polite way of telling you you were being unrealistic. You were supposed to realize that on your own. You told us we were the best. - In high school! - You've said it since. - Marc. - What? Listen to me carefully. You are not in high school anymore. - You don't have to tell me that. - Don't I? Come on, Marc. You're hanging out here all the time. Tacking up your flyers, with your headphones on. Leaving me notes. Still singing with your old high school friends. Still... I mean, you're dating a teenager, Marc. Don't. Don't. Don't you give me that sad little boy look. Don't you do it. All right? God, I mean... What do you want from me, Marc? I'm not your teacher anymore. - I know. - Do you understand that? You want to make a demo album? Are you crazy? When are you gonna realize it? When are you gonna accept that you... You didn't make it? Okay? Open your eyes. It's no big deal. Happens all the time. We all get to that point in our life when we realize, "I'm not good enough." What, are you gonna cry now? Is that what this moment is? Is this the critical scene in the play, and now you're gonna ruin it? Enough, okay? Enough already! How dare you use that against me, knowing what you know. I mean, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten senior year? I told you I couldn't go onstage, remember? Remember? I said I'd break down if I had to get up there. Marc! Kids tell me that every night during production. On the worst day of their lives? - Marc. - Jon! She was your grandmother. The show must go on. I know about you and Meg. I don't know what you're talking about. - This look familiar? - No. No? Maybe we should play it. Maybe we should listen to it, huh? - All right. - In fact, in fact, maybe we should call Vice Principal Yonka... - Okay, give me that. ...in here and play it for her, too. Better yet, there's a whole audience out there. Why don't we play it for everyone, huh? - Give me that, Marc! Give me that! - No! No, no! Tell me, Jon, how many Megs have there been, huh? - Marc! - Five? Seven? And where do you keep their tapes? Are they all right here? - Stop that! Stop it! - Are they all right here? - What are you doing? - What's this? - What is this? What the hell is this? - None of your business! - What is this? Candy? - You're cleaning that up! - What are you doing? - What is all that stuff? No! Stop it! You know what? I'm not the one who's still in high school, Jon. You are! - What are you doing? - It's all the same! Same choreography! - Get off that piano! - Same blocking! - What are you doing? - It's the same show! - That's it! - No! You stop... That's not cool! Get off me! Give me the tape! Give me the tape! Give me the tape! I'm wet! My pants! That's why you never gave her a good part, isn't it? To get back at me! She doesn't emote. You know what? You're lucky. If it was just you on that tape, I'd play it for the whole school. And you'd never teach musical theater in this town again. Who Who do you think you are? Who told you Told you that you're the star? Gerry. Marc. So, congrats on that promotion, man. Dayton, huh? Outstanding! Listen, no hard feelings. Meridian 8's had a heck of a wild ride. And I just want to say... I love you, man. I love you. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? - Oh. Your hair. - I cut it. You look good. We need to break up. I'm breaking up with you. What? Just because I'm quitting singing? - That's so stupid, Marc. - I don't care if you quit singing. I mean, I do care, but that's not why we have to break up. Well, why then? Look at me. I'm just too old for you. This is great, you know? I can't believe I'm crying right now. This is... Thanks. Don't cry, Meg. Listen to me. You have an amazing voice. I just want you to find what makes you happy. Okay? Yeah? It's all supposed to be fun. Right? Tell me, my good fellow, do you still have the balloon that brought you here? Yes, I do. The ladies put it up in the park and made a national shrine out of it. Just as I thought. Now, the balloon brought you here from Nebraska, why can't it take Dorothy back to Kansas? Wiz, 30 seconds. Sorry, man. - Oh, shit! Oh, shit! - Are you all right? Oh, no. - What's wrong with you, man? - What's happening? - He ran into me with the corn! - Who hit you with the corn? I bet if you started all over again someplace else, you could do all of this, and even have some friends. Okay, let's try to get him up. Come on. - No. I can't move my leg. - Wiz? - Patrick, go get Mr. Gribble! Go! Go! - Wiz? Tell them I'm hurt. The Wiz isn't so bad, once you get to know him. Is he? I have to get back to Kansas. All right, everyone, move, out of the way, move, move, hold this. I'm sure he has a really good reason for not being here. He's a busy guy. Everything's gonna be okay. Give me your cape. Maybe we should go and find him, Tin Man. I think Scarecrow should do it. Listen, you guys, eight years from now, none of this is gonna matter. I've done it! - Wiz? - Yes! I got to leave, so I'll pack my bag And I'm going I've got a date, so don't you ask me to stay, 'cause I'm showing You were always ready for new wizardry You must have thought that miracles came easy to me Take what I give you and put it up on the shelf 'Cause now it's time for this here Wiz to wiz on himself And I'm wizing Why aren't you out onstage? Why? It doesn't make a difference. What? - I'm not good at anything. - Yes, you are. You're a great writer. - Really? - I've always been a big fan. Give me a reason why I should stay and I'll judge it My, my, my, my mind is made up So nothing you gonna say is gonna budge it I packed up my clothes and I packed up my power I'm leaving this place in less than one half hour If you look up in the sky You'll know who it is It's not a bird, it's not a plane It's just a little ole Wiz And guess who's on after that? What's he doing out there? He was the only one who knew the part. I knew the part! I packed up my clothes and I packed up my power I'm leaving this place in less than one half an hour If you look up in the sky You'll know who it is It's not a bird, it's not a plane It's just that funky ole Wiz And guess who's on after that? No. No, no, that's not true. I mean, you're wrong. I'm not a great writer. I don't have a gift. But I am a great singer. I mean, I can be. I will be. Because I love it, Mr. Edwards, I do. I really do. I love singing. - Great, Meg, that's... - I gotta get back onstage. - Oh, yeah! - Y'all got it! Y'all got it! Y'all got it! Y'all got it! Come on! Man, we love you! I'm back! Thank you! Thank you! Bye! Hey! Bye. I love you! Bye. This is great! This is great! Bye. Goodbye! I love you! Hey, Joseph? Mr. Gribble? Are you okay? Ten minutes of heat. Ten minutes of ice. Ten minutes heat, ten minutes ice. Straight through to half-hour tomorrow night. Stand by, five. Give me a hand. Wow. Wow. Wow. That was... I mean... My heart's pounding right now. Thank you. Who are you? I'm Marc Pease. This next song goes out to, well, to myself. This one's for you, Marc. Sometimes you start feeling so lost and lonely Then you'll find it's all been in your mind Sometimes you think someone is the one and only Can't you see it could be you and me? But if there's any doubt Then I think I'll leave it out Gonna tell you one thing You can't get what you want Till you know what you want You can't get what you want Till you know what you want Sometimes you can't see that all you need is one thing If it's right you could sleep at night But it can take some time But at least I'm here in line 'Cause tell you one thing You can't get what you want Till you know what you want You can't get what you want Till you know what you want Here we go!
