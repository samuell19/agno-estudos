Kick it! Well done! "But I... with my light, deepen the world's riddles, and as, with its white rays, the moon lessens not, but tremblingly deepens night's mystery, I, too, amplify the dark horizon with broad tremors of holy mystery and all that's unrevealed turns ever more unknowable under my gaze..." How are you? I'm fine. Ana? Yes. Say something! Is there anything left to be said? You already knew. Then go. Is there anything holding you back? Wait a sec. What for? You already have your things packed. You looked forward to leaving. It's not up to me. You don't know how to play football! - And you do? - We had a few good twists! Can we talk after class? - I'm going home. - Then I'll see you at Roxana's. I won't come. Will I have to hold your head again? I'll clean the mess! - So, can I count on you? - Of course you can. What do we bring? Nothing. My mom already prepared everything. Oh, we need a new rule! Geo is banned from saying jokes! I'll try, but I can't promise! I really understand you. You know how I felt when I broke up with Victor. In two months, you'll forget about Sorin. It's not the same thing. You could've still seen him. What would you do if you were me? I don't know... but I wouldn't let myself get affected by this tonight. I can't come. My mom won't let me. - I'll talk to her. - No way! Can't you understand that I can't stand seeing him? I can't stand seeing him anymore. - Ana, come on. - Bye. - I'm home. - Hi! How are you, Ana? How was school? Like usual. I asked you not to let your slippers in the middle of the room. - Are you leaving? - Yes, I've got a meeting. Again? Yes. Not everybody has your teacher schedule. Some have to work in this family. I washed the dishes. Sure. Two plates and one fork. Thank you so much! - Has the match started yet? - No, it yesterday's. Today is the doubles match, it starts later. How was school? It was fine. I'm going to a meeting. I won't stay long. I left you the food in the oven. Look, dad... some classmates of mine have a get-together at Roxana's. They'll listen to music, they'll talk. Can I go? We'll be there around three or four, I'll be home at eight. Sure, it's fine by me. But ask your mother as well. She won't let me go. Can't you talk to her? - She will. - She won't. If you tell her the way you told me, she will let you go. Pretty please, talk to her. - Are Roxana's parents there? - Yes... No, they are on a business trip. They'll be back tomorrow. We won't do anything wrong. Just a few classmates listening to music. Maybe we'll also watch the match. Please. Can I go? Fine, I'll talk to her. A generation who thinks and acts according to an honest impetus, according to a natural call to bring about that change... It is the immutable law of evolution. The law that is beyond the will of philosophers and heads of government. A law that, if fallen under the power of any political group... The Earth would lose one of its most priceless gifts, the pulsation of life. And as we're confronting this idea, of the major role that pop music started having in the modern world, mostly thanks to the Beatles, I remember a prediction of the English magazine, "Melody Maker". Maybe tomorrow, pop music... will turn out to be a political power. If the future belongs irreversibly to today's youth, whose sensitivity and thinking find not only a mere echo, but also an impetus and a guide in the pop music, in its turn, this art unfolds on the spur of the new generation. You won't go anywhere! - Yes I will. - This time you won't. If you want to meet with Roxana, you can tell her to come here. There's no need. Ana, I'm serious, you have your graduation exam. - So what? - "So what"? If you don't see me, it doesn't mean I don't study. - Yeah, sure. - Believe what you want. You're insolent. You're not going anywhere! And not another word. ...nowadays, the underground genre has also reached an advanced stage, becoming increasingly popular. We'll always respectfully come back to those who were... Ana, please stay home this time. Ana! Hello. Ana! - You said you were not coming. - I changed my mind. Come in. I spoke to Tudor. They'll also come earlier and bring up some vinyls. They'll be here any minute now. What are you doing? Gonna stay dressed like that? No, I'll borrow something from you. What are you gonna wear? The green pants and a shirt. What will you lend me? You like this one? Is it your size? It's a bit too large. Let's see in my mom's closet. - Want some brandy? - No. Who else is coming? Except our gang, Tibi and his new girlfriend, and Silviu. Silviu? Yes. Silviu is coming too. That's how you're gonna dance with Sorin. I love you, Ana! I love you. I can't live without you! Stop it! That's how I'm gonna dance with Tudor. And us two? Look at this one. It's OK. Or... This one. If you don't like this one either, I'll send you home. They're all nice. Or this one that my mom wears at funerals. And I'll also call a mourner for you. I'll try on this one. Want some stockings, too? - Here. - Let me see. Listen... What are you doing? You don't even smoke. I want to ask you something. You and Tudor, when you locked yourself in the room... Have you slept with him? You found out Sorin is leaving for Germany and decided you love him. I loved him before. If it wasn't leaving, now you would just stroll holding hands. That's how I am, the romantic type. But does it hurt a lot? Not a lot. Just... a bit. But you'll like it, believe me! - Hi! - Welcome! - How are you? - Fine. Come in. When did you have your last period? I don't remember. He won't marry you just because you're knocked up. - Those days are gone. - Chill, I'm not that naive. - Come on now! - I'm coming. Here. Thank you. Cheers! - Cheers! - Are you toasting without me? Come join us! Cheers! You don't get it. - I want to know if he loves me. - I'll set everything up for you. - Don't worry. - It's not about that. If you want to, I'll even guard the door. I must know if he loves me. Do you understand? So, we have Ceausescu on the stamps, right? Ceausescu goes on disguise to a postal office to see how the stamp sells. "It doesn't sell well", says the clerk. - "Why?" - "It doesn't stick." Ceausescu spits on one, he puts it on an envelope: "Why do you say it's not sticking? It sticks very well!" "Indeed but they all spit on the other side." Tell us another joke. I heard you from outside. A Romanian who got to the USA and wanted to settle down there was unpacking... - We lost the match, right? - 2-5. At one point, he takes out a picture of Ceausescu. His friend, intrigued, says: "Why do you carry that with you?" "Well, when I miss my country, I take a look at it and I stop missing it." Did you drink it all already? - Yes. - Do you want a refill? - I'm fine. - So, no refill? Fine, just a little bit. Thank you. - Cheers! - Cheers! Octav, here! Jimi Hendrix, "Foxy Lady". Wow! Chicago, "Saturday in the Park". I don't like that one. For me it's easy. Blood, Sweat and Tears. - Which song? - Any song. - Then write it down. - I'm writing down "any song". I want Jimi Hendrix as well. Dude, do you know only Jimi Hendrix? What's your problem? I'll draw one more heart. Everyone writes what each wants. - Who else and what else? - Me, Jimi Hendrix. - Very funny. - Fine, it's settled. So, recap. "Dear Cornel, we're a group of friends, senior high school classmates. First, we would like to thank you for the wonderful radio shows that you are broadcasting for the Romanian youth and that we listen to breathlessly. We are writing this letter together. Some of us have already written to you. But most of the time, our letters did not reach you. As you know, life has changed a lot since you've fled Romania. After a misleading opening to the West, we got back to the old habits. Finding books started to be harder and harder. Much less music. The communist propaganda has spread its tentacles over our lives. Even so, we try to hold on, to heroically make it in this grey and desolate world. We like the hippie trend we found out about thanks to you, the idea of peace, of love. "Make love, not war." Beautiful! "Here, unfortunately, it's unheard of. The Union of Communist Youth meetings have become springs of propaganda. At school, we're presented with the danger that is Radio Free Europe. This invisible enemy of the people. We are grateful for everything you do for us and for our generation. So, we use this opportunity to ask you to play the following musical requests..." - Cheers. - Cheers. Come on! METRONOM '72. Hosted by Cornel Chiriac. Dear friends, today I'll bring a tribute to the memory of Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, who passed away in Paris, because of a heart attack. Perhaps the most iconic song of the band is still "Light My Fire", their first international success. The dear departed Jim Morrison, was an icon himself for the American Youth, for the new generation... Maybe you my Romanian friends, are not so aware of him being an icon. I myself also perceived him only partially as such, at the Isle of Wight Festival. Jim Morrison had utterly changed, when I got to see him performing live." Don't worry, he'll come. How do you know? Tudor told me. - Told you what? - Sorin will deliver the letter. What? You didn't know? He's going to meet a foreign reporter at the stadium. What reporter? A French one. He didn't tell me anything. Some guy, friend of his dad's. Why does he have to take the letter? He knows a foreign reporter. Everything is set. They meet and that guy takes the letter out of the country. So they convened. Come on! Don't say a thing, this stays between us. How are you? Sorin didn't come? He will. Three sets, right? Yes, 6-2, 6-0, 6-3. We were deplorable defeated. The whole nation will be in mourning tomorrow! What are you doing? What are you doing here? I came. You said you wouldn't. Why wouldn't I? I'll take you home. No, I want to stay here. What's with you? I'm taking you home. What's wrong with you? Please! We'll talk later. Why are you acting like this? If I knew you're coming, it would have been different. What's happening to us is not my fault. I know. I'm sorry. I love you. I love you. Let's go. Where? What are you doing? What are you doing? Where are you going? All right. Sign here... and here. - Good evening. - Good evening. Where to? I'm going to Paraschiv family. - What's your name? - Stefan Ana. I'll come back. Go in, please. Go in. Comrade Captain, I found someone else. - Get over there with the others! - Get over there! Ispas? Check the other rooms. Look at this, Ispas, Led Zeppelin! Not something you've heard of. - Dan. - At your order! Take a photograph of this. At a tea party, one drinks only tea. Roxana, tell me what's going on. Why are they here? We're intellectuals... We have higher preoccupations! Who's the host? The one who just walked in... Do we have any ID? I'll bring it right away. Everybody get ready to go quietly. Come on. I said get ready to go! Can you tell us what we did? Just get in there! Give me the ID. Miss Host, stay with us for a bit. Come on. Get in. Come on. Get in! What are you looking at? Get in. Keep it down, will you? Hurry up! Come on, hurry up! You'll write a little statement. "I, the undersigned", name, surname, date of birth, parents' name, home address. Then write an essay, like at school. Born on... You have arrived at the home of the said Roxana Paraschiv. You've got together there with multiple friends, classmates, in order to listen to the Metronom show, on Radio Free Europe. The following have also attended this clandestine get-together... Here you mention the name and surname of everyone who was there. I'm interested in what you have discussed, the plans you've made, absolutely everything. Understood? Could you call my mother? She'll be very worried. She works at Lido, she's on the night shift. You want me to call your mom? Yes. He wants to call his mom. Thank you. Let's call her! Thank you. You wanna call your mom? - You wanna call your mum? - Yes. Come on, up! Up! You brag about your connections? Get the fuck out! Out! Today's date, October 14th. What's this? Go on, keep writing. Today's date. What's unclear? Are you mocking us? Tell me, are you mocking us? Write or I'll smack the hell out of you! Take her to the other room. Those dammed Americans! The umpires cheated for them. Right, Ispas? What do you think? You're right, comrade Colonel. We have another patient. Take a seat, please. Colonel Biris Nicolae. What's this? I asked you something. The statement. Please. Write a statement that details who are the real offenders, who wrote the letter, how you were planning to send it to Radio Free Europe. Describe the facts exactly as they occurred. I don't want to hurt anyone. The damage is already done, miss. I don't understand. I'm not debating, OK? Your statement is incomplete. What did we do so wrong? Allow me to quote you from law 23/1971. It's October '72, the law has been in effect for a year now. "The Romanians can't have any ties to foreign radio or TV stations or foreign press corps, which, through their actions, conduct a smear campaign or one against the interests of the Romanian state." Failure to comply with legal provisions constitutes an unlawful conduct and is punishable. Do you understand? I didn't do any of these. What are you accusing me of exactly? Miss Stefan, please gather your thoughts. Take a deep breath and let's focus on the statement. You don't understand how things work around here. We ask the questions. You just answer. When I ask "where", I want to hear a place. When I ask "who", you tell me a name and so forth. Understand? Come on, please. You haven't been here before. First time, right? Yes. We just want to identify the culprits and go home. We didn't do anything. You've held clandestine meetings, wrote letters, contacted foreign citizens to take the letters to Radio Free Europe. Should I continue? I didn't do anything. I thought you were an honest young woman. "The hostile propaganda campaign against the socialist order is punishable with six years of prison and four years of deprivation of all rights laid down in Article 64, points A and B of the Criminal Code." You understand what you did? Come on, please. With name, surname, date of birth... Exactly as my colleagues have instructed you. I wrote it all down. I have nothing else to declare. Send in the next one. You gather in apartments, write letters, and then you come here and stare at me like some innocent doe. But guess what? You're toast, done! I'll take care of this. What if I send you downstairs with a few comrades? We'll see then what else you have to say. Speak! Now you keep your head down? You think that you're special, that you stand out? Do you want me to deem you accessory to conspiracy as moral and material aid? Answer! We're talking about prison, years of hard time incarceration. You dislike us giving you an education, free school, on a platter. You're an adult, from now on you'll answer for your deeds. I feel pity for your parents. You'll kill them, you idiot. Get over here. You have five minutes. Forgive me! There, there. Ana, listen, we don't have time. I managed to convince them to give you another chance. But you have to tell the truth. - Okay? - I did that. Hold on, sit here. Listen to me. From the statements of the others, it turns out that you had nothing to do with the letter. What do you want to prove? You're not proving anything. We're talking about prison, Ana. Do you understand? - I know, I've been told. - And? What? You have to tell them about the letter and you have to write down all the names of the ones who were there. Okay? Ana, you want to destroy us? Believe me, tomorrow you'll see things completely different. It wasn't easy for me to get here. You have been followed for months now. You did something stupid. It's this new law. They can't wait to make an example out of you. Do you understand? - I'm sorry. - I know. And if it wasn't for Biris, you'd be in trouble. So, please, do as I say. - And send my friends to prison? - No, Ana. We'll talk, I'll make some phone calls. You've made enough calls. - It's a criminal case. - So what? Ana, listen to me, look at me! Look at me! Everyone wrote the statement. Everyone. - They are my friends. - I know they are your friends. But you don't see the seriousness of the situation. You want to destroy your future for something you didn't do? Ana, why are you acting like this? - Why are you taking this out on us? - I'm not! Good God! What have we done for you to punish us like this? Ana... I have nothing to declare. I don't care. Ana, what's with you, honey? I neither asked you to come here, nor to make calls for me. Who are you protecting, Ana? Do you know what your Sorin did? He invented a story about foreign reporters and you believed him. He gave the letter to them, that's what he did. He was ordered. That's not true. How do you think they knew everything you were doing? - Liar! - They knew everything. No, shut up! Don't say that! They knew about Radio Free Europe and the letters. They knew everything. Do you think they knew it out of the blue? Don't you understand that they knew when you met, who you talked to, where you met. This boy had a deal with them - so he can go to his father. - It's not true! Liar! Please, I beg you! I'm not lying. I'm not lying, believe me, I'm not! Ana, there's nothing we can do. Listen to me, facts are facts. We can't change anything. Do you want to be jailed? To make you an accessory? It's six years. Is that what you want? You're just like them! They've instructed and manipulated you. The truth hurts, I know. Let me have a look. "I, the undersigned Ana Stefan, residing in Bucharest, declare the following. On the evening of October 14th 1972, I have met at the home of the Paraschiv family: Manea Nicoleta, Grigoriu Laura... " OK, and here you mentioned everyone present. "The main purpose of this get-together was to write a letter to the Radio Free Europe station, addressed to Cornel Chiriac, host of the Metronom show, broadcasted on the Romanian section of this radio station. I admit and regret the deeds, I believe I have profoundly mistaken. The fact that I ended up in front of the State Security organs has given me a lot to ponder. I have been made aware of the danger this radio station represents and I admit to breaking the laws of our state when I proceeded to write the letter. Even though the content does not belong to me, the deed remains, and in the future, I must revise my attitude towards society, school and family, to redress and focus my working capacity towards things useful to our society." Very good. Now start a new paragraph... "This is my given statement. I warrant to what I have declared... ... and I sign." And you sign down there, to the right. That's it. Things parents do for their children. What college are you thinking of? I haven't decided yet. Aren't you gonna follow your dad's footsteps? He's a very good teacher. My father finished law school. I don't like it. Maybe, although you'd have some support. Your father has tenure, right? He's still a teacher. He enjoyed the university environment, writing, publishing. Do you want a glass of water, a coffee? You had a long day. No, thank you. Please bring us a glass of water and a coffee. Thank you. How's the competition in law school? When my daughter applied, there were 20 candidates on one position. But nowadays it's though everywhere. But law and medical schools are the toughest. Forgive me, please. We're digressing. Your father is desperate. He begged me to help you. And I want to help him. I promised him I'd do everything in my power. Your statement will reflect well on the file. I'll add a note here and there to reinforce the idea that you didn't partake to the letter, that you were not aware of the plan, that you opposed it. After the dust settles we'll talk and see how we can help you so you may have a normal life. I'll try helping you not to end up in the prosecutor's hands. It was a moment of confusion. Am I right? You'll see that the college years are the most beautiful. You'll see. You'll make new acquaintances, new friends. I'll make sure that you go to the college of your choice. You don't want law school, so be it, there are others. But every college is tough or very tough to get into. You, though, you'll get into any college you want to. I give you my word. It's just that, we need to make sure you're trustworthy, that you're not bullshitting us. Yes. Set them on the coffee table, please. Do you need anything else, comrade colonel? - You don't want coffee? - No, thank you. That would be all, thank you. Let's go to the coffee table. Have a seat on the armchair. Zefir, menthols. No, thank you. A formality to make sure you understood what you need to do. From now on, you'll be much more responsible and careful about what's going on around you. And we'll make sure that you'll get into college, and that you'll pass your exams, for you not to be assigned to Nowheresville or who knows where Understand? A written confirmation to what we've discussed. Name, surname, date of birth, sign on the right, and it's done, you go home. Your father is waiting for you to go home. Poor man. Thank God you've come to your senses. I'm also a parent. My daughter is a few years older than you. Next year she'll graduate law school. You've had an amazing chance. You should be thankful. Think of your future. Your father pleaded on his knees. He begged me not to leave you to the prosecutors. He gave his word for you. He said that you're sorry, that you'll straighten out, to give you one more chance. I took pity seeing him like that. But if you're playing me... I'll destroy both of you. If you want to sign, fine. If you don't, goodbye. But don't make me waste my time. I thought you were a smart girl. Your choice... If you want to destroy your future, your folks, do it. I won't stand in your way. You think I'm going to beg? Fuck off, out of my sight! Send Ispas to me. I'm done here. Take her next-door and send her father home. I'm sorry. You said something and I missed it? I'm sorry! I would like to have one more chance. Here's the deal, let's not drag this any longer. You're tired Ana, you had a long day. I'll give you one more chance. You don't have to sign anything now. I'll let you think about it for a few days. I'm not forcing you to sign anything. Don't make this decision under pressure. If you want to do this together, I want your full commitment. I want you to come to me and convince me that you deserve this chance. Not everyone gets this chance. Do you understand? Come on... Go home, rest, and we'll see you in a few days. Okay? I'm sure you're a smart girl and you'll make a wise choice. And don't forget. What we discussed here is... ... our little secret. Okay? Go on now... Go home. We'll contact you, okay? Come on, go. Come on, everyone to bed. The important thing is to pass the baccalaureate exam... Yes, thank you. I'd be very much obliged if you can help us. Sure. Sure, thank you so much. Okay, sure, I'll wait. Yes, I'll wait. Thank you. - Can I make a call? - No. Why not? Not now. - Why not? - Ana! Why can't I make a call? We're waiting for a call. Go to your room! The security council will be reunited at 19 hours Greenwich, in an hour and a quarter, respectively, to examine the request of Qatar's acceptance among the UN member countries. On the Council's table was put the letter addressed by the spokesperson of Jordan to the UN in which it is requested to convening... Good afternoon. Hello, Ana. - Sorin is not home. - When are you leaving? Come in. Sorin is about to arrive. He went to get the train tickets. If all goes well, we'll leave tomorrow. It surely will. You don't need to take off your shoes. A glass of water or a cup of tea? No, thank you. Mom, I'm home. It took some time, but I did it. - Hi... - Did you get the tickets? Yes. Bravo! When did you get here? Not too long ago. I was waiting for you. Come to my room. I don't want to justify myself... ... or explain anything. I know everything. Yes. It's me who gave the letter to the State Security. But you knew it would hurt us. Yes. Otherwise they wouldn't have let us go. But you were not supposed to be at Roxana's. It doesn't matter. You betrayed us all. Ana, I love you. You're lying! I'm leaving. I walk you out? What's this? I want to send it. Are you insane? Is that what's burning you now? We don't know if we'll take the exam and you're writing letters? You think that he stays there, in Germany, and listens to Radio Free Europe? - You're delusional. - It's not about that. - Can't you see what I wrote? - Precisely. Ana, what's wrong with you? You're writing letters now? I don't get you. It's important for me. That's why you called me here? Did they tell you if they'll call you there again? No. What should I do there? You? Me neither. But I heard it's not over. From whom? What does your dad say? He doesn't know anything. - Will they call us again? - I don't know. He has no clue either. How would he know? You definitely know something. Tell me, will this go on any longer? - Can I clear the table? - Yes. Thank you. Will they let us take the baccalaureate? How should I know? You really don't care. I do, I care. Of course I care. I want this as well. This is all that matters now. Me, me! - Here! Geo, here! - Back! - I'm going to get a B. - Me, a B plus. - I'm getting an A. - I'm between A and B. Since when are you an A student? - A clean A. - I'm also getting an A. I've written ten pages in one and a half hour. - Did you mention that Ana dies? - She dies hanged. And her child dies. Petrica. From a disease. Who was the beautiful one? Ana or Florica? One was rich and beautiful. - Florica was ugly. - She was beautiful! One was beautiful and poor, and the other was ugly and rich. I got them the other way around. Florica is the beautiful and poor one...
