[♪♪♪] CATHY GUISEWITE: My favorite memory of comics is Sunday morning. You know, the comics wrap the paper, and you'd grab the Sunday paper that had the comic strip you loved best on it. And then the classic family breakfast was sitting with the comic page open and reading it. And that's how you started your day. And I'd like to read the comics with my dad. I'd like to sit in a big chair with him with his arm around me and we'd read the comics. And when I visited my grandparents, same thing- sit in a big chair with grandpa, put his arm around me and read the comics. It's so sad to me to see newspapers close and to hear people talk about them going away is sad, really sad. In my fantasy world, everybody will get sick of the internet. [LAUGHS] People will so long for something tangible that newspapers will come back. [♪♪♪] JOHN GEDDES: What truly is unique about comic strips in particular is they provide a quick respite from what's going on in your daily life. So, it's allowing that inner kid inside you to come out. I'll read a comic strip a day just to keep myself sane. JERRY HOLKINS: Comics are tasty in the way that you can just pop it in your mouth. It's so concise. MIKE KRAHULIK: There's nothing extra on them. They're just exactly what they need to be. JERRY HOLKINS: Just a lozenge of an idea. BILL WATTERSON: All the clutter has to be eliminated, and as a result, the few lines and the few words that remain are concentrated. I think that cuts through to the essence of things. In the right hands, a comic strip attains a beauty and an elegance that really I'd put against any other art. PATRICK MCDONNELL: I feel like words and pictures are just magical, been around forever, just a great, you know, a great marriage. [BIRD CHIRPING] [PENCIL SCRIBBLING] - I was reading comic strips before I could even read comic strips. - Popeye... - Little Lulu... - Steve Canyon... - Pogo... - Beetle Bailey... - Peanuts... - Garfield... - Hagar the Horrible... - The Far Side... - Doonesbury... [VOICES CLATTERING TOGETHER] - Bloom County... - Mutt & Jeff... - Little Lulu - Ricochet - Smitty - For Better or For Worse - My father loved Moon Mullins and on Sunday morning he'd say, "Go down and get the paper." And I'd bring it back, I'd lie in bed next to him, and he'd read Moon Mullins. And he would laugh so hard, the tears would come down his cheeks. And I'd lay there just giggling and lovin' and thinkin', "Oh boy, I'd love to do that to people." - I must have been five. I couldn't read and... but I'd follow Henry, pantomime strip, bald-headed kid. And I probably gained a great appreciation for physical humor as a result of being an avid comics fan before I could read. - My first memories of cartoons were really about the pictures. - I was fascinated not so much with the pictures as with the balloons, because I could read. - The moment I read for the first time was a little copy of one of those Peanuts Fawcett paperbacks. - Peanuts. - Peanuts. - Peanuts. - Peanuts. - Peanuts books. RICHARD THOMPSON: I remember when I was in, like, third or fourth grade, the Peanuts books would come out and we would read them, and with my friends we'd act them out. Some girl would be Lucy, some girl would be Violet maybe; and it was Schroeder standing up on his piano, declaiming in German, I had to read that and I didn't know what it was saying but it was like a little script for us. PATRICK McDONNELL: More than any strip almost, the Peanuts characters were just alive to everybody. And they were drawn with so much joy; he called it 'warmth.' I mean, they just radiate warmth. INTERVIEWER: What is your first memory of reading comics, - I think Garfield was the first one I read. - The little Garfield books. SCOTT KURTZ: My mom bought me the first collection of Garfield. In that first strip Jon was a cartoonist. So, in my first look at a person's studio was that first panel, was like, "Hi, my name's Jon. I'm a cartoonist. This is my cat Garfield. - I discovered Calvin and Hobbes at the Scholastic Book Fair once. And then I had to go and find all of the rest. - I remember when Calvin came in, it literally took my breath away. I mean I hadn't seen anything like it. KRIS STRAUB: It would have been the first Calvin and Hobbes collection with the wagon, where they're jumping into the river. INTERVIEWER: Why does that one stick with you? - 'Cause he had a friend. [LAUGHING] He had a buddy. KRIS STRAUB: No, I think that had a lot to do with it, because I had an imaginary friends, and here it was codified-- like here's a kid who had an imaginary friend and it's not dumb, like, and he had a cool friend. [LAUGHS] - I started reading Bloom County and there was a little boy in that comic strip who was-- I think his name was Oliver. So, here was a little character of color allowed in the newspaper. And I started to think, "Wow, maybe I could do this." - When I was little I became a big fan of Foxtrot. Page would daydream about some dreamy French man. And they were my favorite. - I read Nancy, kind of the way everybody does. Just to make sure that it was still incredibly simple and dumb. Because if Sluggo says something clever, maybe I shouldn't leave the house. Maybe that's like an omen. - Pogo was a strip that I used to love even though I never understood one word of it. - I sort of felt like the rest of the newspaper was for my parents, and the comics page was for me. - My dad would unfold the newspaper, chuck out the comics page to me. - You could have one sheet and someone would have another and like, you'd trade them off. - Reading the Sunday paper as a kid, it was bigger than me. So, you know, I'd have it spread out on the floor. - Spread out on the floor you know, trying to copy the pictures. And that was it! I mean, I was hooked. - My first memory of reading comic strips, you know, my parents took the Herald Examiner in Los Angeles, which is now defunct, and I remember this magnificent spread when they used to run 'em this big, and I just was so drawn into this amazing world that these guys could create in this little rectangle. I was so enchanted by the idea that one person could create such a compelling world every day. [CITY SOUNDS] [PENCIL SCRIBBLING] [OLD-TIME MUSIC] - A great many of you are under the impression that to be a comic artist, you have to be crazy. That is not true. But it is a big help. - Cartoonists were more of a public figure than they are today. - I remember walking into a restaurant with Milton Caniff and all the heads would turn around and say, "There's Milton Caniff, there's Milton Caniff!" 1950'S INTERVIEWER: Milton, how would you explain the popularity of the Steve Canyon helmet? - Well, it was a carefully planned promotion every step of the way. - Everybody knew all about Rube Goldberg and his inventions. - Well folks, there she is. The Rube Goldberg Door-Opener-Upper. - They were famous, you know. That's what I wanted to be. 1930'S NARRATOR VOICE: Windsor McCay and Little Nemo provide the nation with some of its most innocent nonsense. - And there were pictures and there were stories about them were in the paper all the time. - Well, let's let everybody at home know exactly what your line is, shall we? - They were major celebrities. - Do you have a strip that is syndicated? - Yes, I hope. - I know you're not Al Capp. [LAUGHING] - Both Milton and Al Capp made the cover of Life magazine. And they were great guests on talk shows. - Mr. Al Capp. [APPLAUSE] - So I thought this is a career that has everything. It, you know, offers even, dignity. Two things I wanted in the world: celebrity and dignity. And money. That's three things. - Once the continuity comic strip became popular this would be the 30s and the 40s, and the 50s, they were huge. People would run out to get the next installment and find out what happened to that character. - I know what's going to happen for the next two days... [LAUGHING] ...In "Dick Tracy" ...and I'm sworn to secrecy and you couldn't get it out of me even with torture. JEAN SCHULZ: That's what's hard for people to realize today is how important the comics were back then. - Even labor strikes has its lighter moments. - Here's Dick Tracy! - Mayor F.H. LaGuardia reads the comics. - And she says, "When are you going to let me out of here?" - Have you seen a movie called How to Kill Your Wife? The interesting thing about it-- this guy does an adventure comic strip. And he's living in this beautiful brownstone house in New York. - ...with a manservant. - This would not seem odd at the time, that this cartoonist would be so rich. [SHOUTING] - 70s and 80s, and 90s, you know, comics were huge. - Merry Christmas Charlie Brown! FEMALE VOICE: ♪ Eep, opp, orp, ah AHH! ♪ - I carry the American Express card, and wherever I go, folks treat me like a fat cat. JOHNNY CARSON: You think men or women are even supposed to understand each other? - Well, it's always the man's fault. - Oh, I see. I see. - For Lynn Johnson, life is more for better than for worse. - I can't imagine a cartoonist Hall of Fame without you in it. - Murder She Wrote. Yeah. - Mrs. Fletcher, this is Mel Lazarus. - What a pleasure, Mr. Lazarus. - How do you do, Mrs. Fletcher? BILL WATTERSON: A comic strip takes just a few seconds to read but over the years, it creates this surprisingly deep connection with readers. The daily deadlines are brutal for the creator, but there's a real payoff to that daily contact. Seeing the strip every day is a-- it's a fun little ritual. And people feel connected to what you've created. Even in a few panels, you can develop characters and express an outlook on life as the months go by. And before you know it, readers are seriously invested in the world that you've created. So I think that incremental aspect, the unpretentious daily-ness of comics is a surprising source of power. Readers do form an emotional bond with your strip. [PLAYGROUND SOUNDS] [PENCIL SCRIBBLING] - I remember drawing as early as 2 and 3 years old. I was a fanatical drawer. - I learned how to cartoon when I was eight. 'Cause, you know, I actually made comic strips when I was eight. I never stopped doing it since them. - My first memories of drawing comics, it was just copying a lot of Garfield imagery. His work was slick. At the time, it was kinda like looking at cartoons on the page. - I was asthmatic. Severely asthmatic, as a child. And I had to spend a lot of time in bed. - I had bronchitis every winter. So, I'd miss about a month of school. - To entertain me, mom would give me pencil and paper. - She gave me one of those portable desks, you know, there's bean bags in the bottom of it. - So, I spent a lot of time with my own imagination. - And I would sit in bed and draw. She said that's when I started drawing. - You know, while asthma worked for me. I wouldn't recommend it to all hopeful cartoonists, but... [LAUGHING] - When I was really young, I wanted to be an animator, and I drew every day. There's boxes of it under my bed that I wouldn't let anybody see. Secret boxes of drawings that were just terrible. That's why no one was allowed to see them. - We had no money, so we had no money for paper. But the Christmas cards at the time, you'd open them up and you'd get four squares. So, I would draw stories in-- you know, starting in the four squares, never thinking that I was actually mimicking the comics page. - I submitted a cartoon to Child Life or something like that, and I won a dollar. And I thought, "Boy, that's where the money is!" I dropped out of school. They couldn't get me to go back. I began sending cartoons around to magazines. I began selling them. I think by the time I was 12, I'd sold over 100 cartoons. - I wanted to find out which magazine paid the most money. I was a real entrepreneur even at 11. So, I did all this research and I found out there was one magazine that stood heads and shoulders above all the others in terms of payment. So, I went home, and at age 11, and started drawing cartoons for Playboy. SCOTT KURTZ: I've always wanted to be a cartoonist since, like, fourth grade. I know I decided in fourth grade, because I know that my fourth grade teacher was really supportive of it. - Teacher in sixth grade gave us a list of vocabulary words and she let me draw a definition to fit each word. - When we were assigned a book report to do, I did a parody of Animal Farm . And my teacher went nuts, my English teacher loved it. He wrote, "You captured the essence of the Animal Farm perfectly, but more importantly, you should be doing a syndicated cartoon strip." And that was the first time I ever heard, "syndicated comic strip." - I was drawing this cowboy in high school and all the girls wanted it in their lockers. - I definitely drew in high school for the newspaper. - You have to find your clique at a certain point, and mine was the high school paper. - I drew for the high school paper, mostly to meet girls. - Jimmy Carter was elected, and I drew a White House with a big smile where the pillars were, and I seen that MacNelly did the same thing, and I thought, "Hey, maybe I know how to do this." - When I was 16 there was -- during the war, World War II. I had three years of high school, and I thought I'd quit because I knew at the end of the year, I'd be going into the service. And I didn't want to waste that time. I wanted to get my career going, you know? I wanted to sell something. And I did. I sold a couple of gag cartoons. That was very exciting, and it was the easiest three dollars I ever earned in my life. INTERVIEWER: Which was probably not bad money though, in '40, what? '42, '43? - It was bad. INTERVIEWER: It was bad? [LAUGHS] - So, I always drew cartoons for fun when I was little, but I never thought, "This is something I'm gonna do professionally." - My parents didn't really understand me, I don't think, that I saw a career and a future in cartooning. They just didn't get that. And so I don't think I felt it a hundred percent myself. - I'm pretty sure I remember my father actually saying, "Oh no no no... These people, these cartoonists, they do it for fun. They don't actually get paid for it." So, I was like, "Oh, cool, maybe I could do that on the side, and I could like, be a teacher or something." - Well, no one ever told me that I could do comic strips or whatever as a living. - I'm sure if you asked me in High School, "So, do you want to do this professionally?" I would have been like, "Ha, ha, you can't make a living doing this!" [♪♪♪] - Last time, we showed how cartoonists lead rich and varied social lives. This week, we show how they turn their doodles into oodles of "Do-Re-Mi." That's right, kids, you can get paid for this. - Mr. Spokesman, you mean the newspapers would pay me for my funny pictures? Not the newspapers, Billy, a syndicate. - A syndicate? - What we do every day at the syndicate is we take something that a cartoonist gives us and we get it into the newspaper. MR. SPOKESMAN: You see, and artist draws a fresh strip every day and sends it off to their syndicate. LITTLE BILLY: Gosh! Every day? MR. SPOKESMAN: Then the syndicate salesmen drive across the country, selling the strip everywhere from Cleveland to Columbus. - They literally have ties and tweed jackets. They go out and pound the pavement to sell the stuff to newspaper editors. MR. SPOKESMAN: Every paper they sell your strip to means more money for you! Of course, they do take a tiny slice of the money. Just 50 percent. - Wow! That's almost nothing! - They're constantly out there with salesmen on the road, selling your strip, doing the billing, sending your strip to the paper... - They do all the legal stuff, they try to get it into books... - So I can understand why they need a bigger chunk. - Now you're on the trolley! And in no time at all, you'll be living in the lap of luxury. - But couldn't I just sells my strips to the newspaper myself? - I could never reach out to all the newspapers that are in the country. I mean, there are guys who self-syndicate, but the difficult thing is then you've got to maintain that, you've got to send them bills and do all that. - And you see, that's why it would be crazy not to use a syndicate. - And un-American! - That's right Billy. "Comics - They're Drawing America's Tomorrow...Today!" - Syndicates are very discriminating. - You know, what it boils down to is it's a very small group of comics that we're capable of doing anything with. But we still receive about 5,000 submissions a year DARRIN BELL: And they launch two features. BILL AMEND: If I'd actually known how unlikely it was that I would be syndicated, I might have just chickened out and not gone to the trouble of mailing stuff off. - In the 90s, when I was first submitting to syndicates, some of the rejection letters told me that if I made my characters either white, animals, or children, it would sell better. - Once I started doing this and I started getting the rejection letters back, I just sort of-- you know, there were times that I would just give up, and I wouldn't do it, or I wouldn't send anything for a while. And then a month or two later, I'd-- "Eh, I'll draw some more and send some more, and give it another try." - I was so frustrated that I actually had-- I remember this, I finished my submission packet and sent it off of Luann. And then I boxed up my pens and my paper and stuff and I put it up on a shelf in the closet. It was like, that's it! I'm done. But, I-- you know, I knew that Luann was probably going to get a nibble. - I got a letter from Lee Salem's secretary, saying, "Lee would like to see another two weeks of strips." And that's all the letter said. And so, that was a world apart from the form letters I'd been getting. I suddenly get this one sentence letter, wow! INTERVIEWER: The day that you found Luann was going to be syndicated, what was that day like? - Have you ever seen someone actually walk on the ceiling? ♪ Hallelujah! ♪ - I was jumping up and down. I was thrilled. I felt like I won the lottery. - I jumped up and down, I picked up my daughter and we jumped around. She had no idea what was happening. I was just so excited, so thrilled. - You hear, "No, no, no, no, no," all throughout your life. And then you get this critical, "Yes." - Probably one of the best moments of my life. - And of course, in no time at all, I realized that there was no money in it. [LAUGHING] You only get-- you only get paid for the newspapers that actually buy your comics. And I think by the time my comic launched, it was about maybe seven papers on opening day. INTERVIEWER: Right. - And it was years and years and years before I had enough papers to quit my day job. - The strip was launched in January of 2002. I was still a lawyer. Eight months later, in August of 2002, I quit. And that was a scary moment for sure. I mean, the partner I told, I remember, looked at me like he felt sorry for me. Like I got a tattoo of an odd-looking bird on my face or something. You know like, "God, you really want to do that?" - It was like a lot of people who knew I'm funny and stuff, and they'll say like, "Hey! What are you working on now?" And I'll say like, "Oh, I'm doing a daily comic strip." And they'll look at me like I just said I had a mental breakdown, and I'm in my basement, and I'm working on model trains. You know, it's like, "Oh, that's so sad." [LAUGHING] LEE SALEM: One of the great Cinderella stories in the business-- Cathy was an unusual strip in that we had a contract out to her the same day her submission came in. INTERVIEWER: Wow! - After college, I was working in the advertising business as a writer. And I had gained about 45 pounds in college. I had this great career going but a miserable love life and very low self-esteem, and I used to write in my diary every night. And one day just instead of writing about my troubles, I drew a picture of what I looked like sitting there waiting for Mr. Wrong to call, you know. Eating everything in the kitchen and lamenting my great career. And I sent the drawing home to my mom, to let her know that I was coping. And it made me feel so good to see my kind of disaster of the day in picture form, that I started doing that a lot and sending the drawings home. So my mom went to the library to research comic strip syndicates. Gave me a list of who to send my work to in the order I should send it. And I sent it just to get her off my back. I sent these scribble drawings to Universal Press Syndicate. - It just happened to end up on the top of my inbox. I just happened to look at it, wrote a note to Jim Andrews, who was my boss, I said, "You know, the art needs some work but I love this writing." And it just happened to go out, and it happened to end up on the top of his inbox, he happened to look it up, and he sent me a note back that said, "I agree, let's get a contract out to her." And we literally mailed her a contract the same day we got it. That doesn't happen much. INTERVIEWER: God, yeah, I'd imagine so. - It was immediate. It was...shocking. They said they had specifically been hoping to find a strip that dealt with a changing world for women. All the submissions they had gotten up to mine were written by men. [♪♪♪] And then I just basically stayed up all night for three months, because I would do my advertising job in the daytime. And I told nobody I was working on a comic strip 'cause I had fought, worked so hard to establish myself as an important advertising person, you know, at a time when women working was new. For anybody to know about this comic strip that I was creating which was sort of showing my most vulnerable side and my most wimpy, you know? INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah. - The day the first strip ran, I hid in the ladies room at the advertising agency and just prayed that nobody would open the paper that day. Everybody saw it. In fact, the Detroit Free Press where I lived at the time did a whole little thing about it starting, and so... It was pretty embarrassing. - One of the things about syndicates is they want to know, can you produce under pressure? Can you produce fast, are you responsible? Are you reliable, are you that creative that you can just keep on producing? And so, they put you under a lot of pressure right at the beginning. So, they want it now! "We want 21 pieces of art, like, in two weeks." And then, whaa! - I went from unemployed and thinking I had a year of doing roughs to being on this treadmill going full speed. You know, and it was a long-term contract that I signed. And so, I effectively went 19 years with not much of a break. - I think the least joyful part of it is that, you know, it is that it's a daily strip with no vacation. You know? And every once in a while, it'd be nice to take a month off and reflect on it. There's no reflection. - To a person, they are workaholics. And there's no break. The mind is always going. I can get away from my desk and go home and do whatever I want to do, and I just don't sense that on the part of cartoonists. - I don't even think of that as work. - No. When you first said it, I was like, "Well, I'm not a workaholic." But then when you went on, I was, "Well, I'm always thinking about comics, and making--" - You know what I mean? Like, it's just sort of these things you don't realize it because it's such an ingrained part of your life too. I'm not an alcoholic, I just need to have alcohol, I just need alcohol to live! BILL WATTERSON: I certainly found drawing a comic strip to be all consuming work. I had virtually no life beyond the drawing board. But I'm...you know, I wasn't looking for a balanced life in those days. My comic strip was the way that I explored the world and my own perceptions and thoughts. So, to switch off the job, I would have had to switch off my head. So, yes, the work was insanely intense, but that was the whole point of doing it. - When you start doing it every day for your vocation, doing seven a week, you have to build up to that. It's like a muscle. - This isn't just a couple of days, or a couple of weeks gig. This is gonna hopefully go 'til the day you die. That's a lot of material. - The first thing that made me nervous earlier in my career was just the idea of having to have a joke a day for the rest of my life, for X number of years. And just to think of that whole thing all at once, to think of all those years and days and jokes just made my head cave in. So, I'd just would, you know, you just have to take it a day at a time. - Sparky -- Charles Shultz -- said, "It's a job where you're doing the same thing over and over, and never repeating yourself." - It's so deceptively difficult. I mean, you'd think, you know, four panels, word balloons at the top, some illustrations underneath, and how hard could that be? - It's a tough job to draw these cartoons. Make 'em funny every day, and to create characters and personalities, and to keep it up. - I would wake up every day of my life with the countdown in my brain. That was always my first thought was the countdown of how many more days until the deadline. How many more strips did I have to do. - The worst feeling is when there are weeks were you just don't feel funny and ideas are illusive, and the deadline doesn't care. And those are the weeks that I just hate. - It's like, "It's going nowhere, it's time to quit, I'm gonna start drinking. I don't know what to do with my life, I failed, everything's a failure." - One of my favorite lines is from this artist Bill Woodman. And he talked about that sheet of paper, he called it "the blazing island of white." - You use that blank, you know, the yawning maw of emptiness. Like, waiting to suck you in and plunge into it. You know, the panic kicks in, the adrenaline kicks in. I pace, I walk around, I'll draw dumb little doodles and... frantically hope something funny comes out. - The worst is when you sit there for four hours, not letting go of one idea. And even though you should, and you hang on, and you have nothing to show at the end of it. - When you're a cartoonist, you're not allowed to have writers' block. HILARY B. PRICE: I used to think that creativity, you know, visited you. And now I realize in the marathon terms, you visit creativity. If this is something that you do seven days a week, you can't wait for the muse to come circling over. You have to shoot her down. [GUNSHOT] [LAUGHING] - It's all about changing gears. If you're stuck on one crappy idea, or you've got no ideas, take your mind somewhere else for a little while. To really do it, you can't be like, "Okay, I'm gonna think about something else." You have to actually get up and walk around or play guitar for a little while or do something to just get over that bump. - It's like what Michelangelo said: The statue is already there, you just have to chip away the extra stuff. I think the script is already there and I just have to bang it out. - You can be a good cartoonist and a bad writer, and you'll never make it. But if you're a good writer and a bad cartoonist, you can make it. I think of gags all the time - I've got a little book that I carry with me - and I write down the ideas as they come to me. - I keep sketch books. I'm now up to number 101. - Because you're on a deadline, you have a routine. And you know you need work, the only way to get work is to think it up, you go sit down, and you start to get into the zone. - Well, I've got a legal pad I pull out with a pen and drink a lot of coffee and start brainstorming by myself. I seem to only be able to write my strip when I'm sitting down at my desk telling myself, "Now it's time to write my strip." So, if I'm at a cocktail party, I'm not thinking of good jokes. - If I find I'm having trouble writing, I can usually trace it to not having read enough. - Just read and read and read, and think, and hope to God that something good will come out of it. - Yeah, if I have a week where I read a book a day, I will never have trouble writing. - I call it "brain farming," where if you think about it, you're kind of planting these little seeds which are totally worthless. You can't eat a seed. And then they sort of grow and your little brain flowers explode out and then you've got an idea a little later. - If you work for a whole day and never came up with one single idea, it wasn't a waste of your time because the next day, you could write two weeks just like that. - I wanted to challenge myself the other week, so I did a bunch of research on the Meech Lake Accord. This was a failed diplomatic process in the early 90s in Canada that led to the Quebec Referendum. And everybody thinks that's hilarious. It didn't work out too well. [LAUGHING] Sometimes it's just like I make a point of doing something that I never heard of before or something that I'm very familiar with, or if it's been a lot of history stuff to do like a superhero, or something autobiographical, or something after that. GREG EVANS: The best writing comes from your heart. You need some spark of inspiration. Something in your own life or something you've experienced that propels it. - Usually, yeah, the words do come first. Usually it's like hearing voices. Especially if it's a specific character then I start hearing voices. Which seems to be, kind of a common thing which I would worry about if this was not a creative process, so-- [LAUGHING] - Characters do have a way of telling you where they're gonna go, or where they need to go, or what needs to happen. LALO ALCARAZ: I'll tell you what I do, is there's a moment I'm sitting there and I'm just tired, or there's a little haze, and I go talk to my muse. She's in the bathroom. Her name is Porcelina. [LAUGHING] I go, I swear to God, this sounds ridiculous, we might as well get it on tape. I go to the bathroom, and I will sit down and like a lightning bolt goes through the top of my head, and just everything's clear. - I have this one incense that's supposed to stimulate creativity. It's probably bullshit. But when I have writer's block, I'll light it up and even though it's probably a placebo, that usually works. - I'll listen to depressing music through headphones that block out any happy thoughts I could have. Because there's this point in depression where your humor kicks in to save you from being depressed, I think. - I'm the only person I know who writes, not draws, but writes to exceptionally loud music, always. [HARD ROCK MUSIC] Like in school, if you're doing really bad, you can sort of like, grit your teeth and force your way to study harder. But creativity is more akin to floating, or balance. Like, if you grit your teeth, you're gonna sink. So, when I listen to the music really loud I sort of go there and I relax, you know what I mean? I try not to think. You can't think through funny. I want that logical brain to just get squished into nonexistence. [LAUGHS] - This was almost like a meditation type thing where you could just zone out and go to that world and just be totally in touch with yourself through the page. That almost Zen Buddhist spark. STEPHAN PASTIS: When it comes out of my pencil on the notebook, when it's being written and I'm watching it, and I laugh like, "Wow, that's good. I'm glad I was here to see it." And I'm not complementing myself. I don't feel like I have... I watched it like you did. I know that sounds odd, but I swear that's the way they're written when they're written well. MORT WALKER: I love thinking of ideas. There you are sitting here with a blank piece of paper and this idea comes, you write it down. And I think, "Ten minutes ago, that idea didn't even exist. Now it's gonna go into the comic strip, and then it's gonna end up in books, and people are gonna be reading that idea for the next 20, 30, 40 years." INTERVIEWER: What's the absolute best moment in your cartooning? - My happiest moment was when I found a joke and when I thought that I'd said something in a way that was unique, but that everybody else probably had felt the same thing but wouldn't put it that way. - I love that I am master of my universe. - I'm sort of a control freak. And so I can make all the decisions myself, and sometimes they're good decisions, and sometimes they're bad decisions. - You have final cut. In what other media do you have final cut on your product? - In comics, you get to do everything, right? You get to act all the parts-- - You're designing clothes, the environments-- - And you get to move the camera, and you get to drive the narrative voice-- - You want total control, you know? And I see a lot of guys in animation who are dying to do comics because they feel like a cog in the machine. So, they want that control back of their story. - I mean, there's nothing wrong with thinking, "I was a part of this." But it's really cool to be able to think, "I did all of this." - Again, Schulz said something about the only place in the entire world he feels comfortable and in charge, and where he feels like he knows what he's doing is at the drawing board. Everywhere else, social situations, he feels like a clumsy klutz, you know? He's totally inept. And I feel like, I know what he's talking about. [STRING SECTION TUNING] [BEETHOVEN - SYMPHONY No. 9] - Drawing is magic and people love watching, seeing a line, and then another line, and then something appears. Sparky would say, "When I... at the moment of drawing the character, I want to be feeling what I'm drawing. And I want it to be spontaneous. So if I'm drawing a mad Lucy, I'm thinking a mad Lucy. And if I'm drawing Snoopy dancing, I'm thinking a happy dance." - You know, a lot of times I write right where I work, and in the summer I have a hammock I like to write in. INTERVIEWER: Oh, that's good livin'! Seems like most cartoonists-- it's something your born to do. I mean, I felt like I wanted to be a cartoonist since reading Pogo and Peanuts. The nice thing about making art is you really lose yourself, you know? To me, it's like prayers and meditation, it's like you just lose yourself, the art comes, there's always a peaceful feeling about it. Even with a deadline. It's usually the drawing that gets the ideas going. Could I put them someplace different, you know? INTERVIEWER: Yeah. - That type of thing. I'm definitely more of a sketcher first than a writer. Doing the sketches is the toughest part and the most entertaining part. Trying to amuse yourself with ideas and-- I kind of do batches of three weeks at a time. So, I sit down with the sketch book, and when I have three weeks worth of jokes, I stop. [LAUGHING] Then it's time to get to real work. I always feel like cartoonists are part dogs, I mean, we have definite routine, we like our little favorite spots. INTERVIEWER: Yeah. - You know, so I think that's part of doing a daily comic strip, you definitely have to enjoy the routine. INTERVIEWER: Are you very specific in your choice of quills? - Yeah, I've been using the same pen here, you can see it, this one's gonna fall ap---, I shouldn't jinx it, but... It's a fountain pen that they don't make anymore. I only have two left. So, that's when I'm probably gonna retire. The day I started the comic strip is the day I really felt like I was home, that I was doing what I was supposed to be doing. And this just opened up my life in so many different ways. So, it was definitely the right move. INTERVIEWER: How does music inform your cartooning and vice versa? - Well, I'm a drummer. So, I think it's rhythm. You know, comics are all about rhythm and telling a gag, and how do you time it. It's all timing. And improvising, too, especially when you're doing a daily comic strip, you kind of have the same themes but it's all about how do you improvise on those themes. I feel like cartooning is a lot like being a jazz saxophone player. I mean, you know, the standard song you're gonna play, but each performance, your solo has to be a little different. Doing this for 17 years, a lot of it has to do with faith. You just have a faith in the creative process. I really do believe it's about getting out of the way. If you can get out of the way, you know, the ideas are out there in the world, the universe is filled with ideas, and you just have to get out of the way and let them come. The moment of creation when the idea comes and God, if you can make yourself laugh, I mean, that doesn't happen that often but when it does, that's always... that's always interesting. INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah. - That's the wonder of all art. You don't really know what's gonna happen, so I think there's a lot of happy accidents. I've always felt comics were a spiritual place- a place to find some comfort and healing. I think it really is close to poetry where you say so much with so little that the reader himself can put more of himself into it. - My father's generation thought of themselves more as entertainers, you know. Their job was to help sell newspapers. INTERVIEWER: Right. - And so if you talked to Milton Caniff, or you talked to Rube Goldberg, or Walt Kelly, or Mort Walker, or even Charles Schulz... for them it's just business. "This is what we do. We're creative artists, but our job is to entertain our readers and sell newspapers for the publishers." - And as long as newspapers are in business, there'll be a place for syndicated comic strips. - It is a dark day for the newspaper industry. The Rocky Mountain News, the oldest paper in Colorado, printed its last issue today after failing to find a buyer. And other papers could suffer the same fate. - After 86 years, the Albuquerque Tribune presses rolled for one last time Saturday morning. - This is an extremely sad day. And a big loss for the city. - I think all of us sort of feel like we're living under the proverbial piano on a rope. At some point, that rope's gonna snap and the piano's gonna fall on your head. - The newspaper cartoons are... may have very well seen their day. STEPHAN PASTIS: Imagine if you're us. I made it in syndication. I did something that is a one in a 36,000 shot. INTERVIEWER: You got in the NBA. - I got in the NBA. All of a sudden, the stadium is collapsing. - You know the newspaper industry is... Well, we all know they're having a hard time. It's difficult to gauge what exactly is going on. - Without that mass medium of support like newspapers, it'd be very difficult to have something as culturally significant as things like Garfield and Peanuts were in their day. - As the mass market crumbles, the newspaper comics are losing the huge audiences they used to have. And with that they're losing the huge revenues and salaries they once generated. And most sadly, I think, the comics are losing the widespread cultural impact they enjoyed for the last century. - I'm sorry for anyone though who has the passion that I had that wants to do a newspaper comic strip. And it just seems to be a dwindling business. I can't say it's dying, but it's a lot harder to get in. - We used to do three strips a year, routinely and now we do maybe three every two years. - When you're syndicated, you get a lot of guys asking you to look at their work because they want to be syndicated. And I've noticed a change in the tone of my response. So, I know that's how I think. I cannot with a straight face encourage them. It's going to be very hard, and there's one basic, specific reason, and that is the two-paper towns have gone away. - It used to be every big city had at least two competing newspapers, the morning paper and the evening paper. And the salesman would come into town with the new strip, and if he couldn't sell it to this paper, he'd sell it to that paper. And it was easy to launch a strip with 100 papers, and grow from there. That's no more. - The competitive newspaper market is gone. And so then is the business model that sustains syndicates for so many years. - Number two, the comics pages have cut whole pages out from Baltimore to Detroit to Houston, they have cut a full page. And they've by and large hit the young guys. I guess some of the older guys would dispute that. But they've hit the young guys. And that's a killer. - I could really empathize with any cartoonist who's trying to sell a strip to a syndicate. Newspapers are just clogged up with Garfield, and Beetle Bailey, and Hagar, and Blondie, and all these strips have been around for decades. There's no room for new talent there. - I think in a way it's hurt the creative community because things that we used to take a risk on we're probably less likely to today. - I don't know what newspapers are going to do, what the solution is. If I knew that, then I'd be so wealthy. I wouldn't even be doing this. - I think a lot of cartoonists are facing, like so many businesses, a whole new reality. A whole new financial business model. And it's a little scary for us because we're cartoonists. We don't know...you know, we're not financiers, and we're not entrepreneurs generally. Except Jim Davis. But the rest of us aren't. - This is a frightening time. Nobody knows what's going to happen. But it's certainly not the death of comics. They will survive. It just remains to be seen in what form. BILL BARNES: It was all about putting in the newspaper. It was all about getting syndicated. - It was initially. SCOTT KURTZ: The whole point of putting my comic on the web was so that when I submitted this to the syndicate, they'd be like, "Oh, yeah. There's that young, chipper, talented upstart from..." KRIS STRAUB: "That go-getter" SCOTT KURTZ: Yeah, from the "Cartoonist At Large" website. BRAD GUIGAR: Well, I had done a couple of syndicate submissions, and of course got rejected, rejected, rejected, and so I was taking a look at this nine weeks I had, and I thought, "I'm gonna put it on the web." RYAN NORTH: And the comic started out with like me and my mom reading it. And then my mom kind of stopped reading it, so it was just me. - I had, with my previous strip, been putting it up on a segment of my family website. And so I was like, "Okay, I'll put one of these up every day and at least my 40 friends and family will complain if I don't get it done." KATE BEATON: So I was like, "Well, I'll just put my comics on Facebook albums because then it...you know, my friends can see it." MIKE KRAHULIK: We had enough basic HTML knowledge that we could "Insert Image"-- like, we could make a little website. - So we did, - ...and we did so. - So, I made a website, and a Live Journal at the same time. - It was a Geocities account, and then you were updating manually, you were archiving manually, every night, because you loved to do it. - I thought I can either get a real job or be a cartoonist. - There was a part of my head that said "People are gonna see this online and then send me money." - We got those banners that you can put on your site and you can click yourself. - So, we'd just sit there and click on our banners all day, and make like a hundred bucks. - I made up stickers and was selling them, like five stickers for two bucks or something. And the first order I was so excited. My first order I gave her 20 stickers and shipped the envelope off and I wrote her, "Oh my God, I'm so excited! Thank you for the encouragement." And she was like, "Yeah, I like the comic." She likes the comic. [LAUGHING] Someone likes the comic. [VIDEO GAME MUSIC] - It seems like nobody knew who I was and then like it just kept getting bigger and bigger very fast. - We went from 40 readers to a thousand readers literally overnight. And 3,000 readers by the end of that week. - It grew really quickly. Six thousand pretty much every day very shortly after I started. - I remember going out with my wife at the end of that week, and going, "Well, things have changed and this is gonna be more real." - It started to feel to me like the early days of television. And you felt like, gee, being on the ground floor of something like this is almost like being Bob Hope, making the transition from radio to television. - Television, well, they finally got me. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] - All my nerdy friends said, "Hey, you should look at this new web comics thing that's going on." Like so many people, I looked at the early web comics and said, "I can do that!" - So, I saw PVP and I was like, "Oh man, that's exactly what I want to do." I should just do it. Just for fun, you know? - I'm gonna pitch it to small publishers but then I was like, "Maybe I'll do web comics if that doesn't work out." - I think we're at a point now where anything goes. As long as you pay for the web-hosting fees, you get to do whatever you want! If you can do something and people like it, welcome to the show. - I don't think that web comics are the answer. GREG EVANS: As soon as you move something from a piece of printed paper over to some sort of a screen or tablet in digital form, all the money sort of seems to flow away. The syndication business model is a jewel. It's so brilliant in its simplicity. BRENDAN BURFORD: It's a long-term partnership. You can't find these solutions very easily in multiple places, let alone one place. - It works so well. If we leave that behind-- that's dollars, the web is pennies. - Obviously they are mad because people aren't buying horse and buggies anymore. It's the same argument I imagine that "horses are so much better. What's with these cars?" This is how people consume things. That's how they do it. They don't read newspapers anymore. Is that unfortunate for you? Absolutely. Will being mad about it change it? No. DAVID MALKI: This book is a Harpers Popular Monthly Collection from 1875. And in the 1860s of Post-Civil War era, it's right where you see the explosion of popular media. And a lot of these books had illustrations in them. Here's one from 1859. And when you compare this with just 20 years later, you can see how this art form is evolving. People just getting better at it. And then what happens, 1892 or so, now you have photographs. Once you have photographs, the demand for engravings just goes through the floor. Between say 1890 and 1900, you had an entire class of craftsman, tremendously skilled craftsman, finding themselves without a market for their work. Because technology just passed them by. It's sad when that happens, but it does happen. And it did happen. And the best of them found a new thing to do with their skills. This is the birth of cartooning. These same illustrators in many cases who have the craft of working in this engraving tradition, they're all out of a job. And so they have to adapt. The ones that do find a new lease on life in cartooning. - Profound changes of technology don't just improve on the previous one, it makes the previous one seem barbaric. Right? By comparison. And I think in some ways the deeper I got into some of the possibilities for digital comics, the more barbaric it seemed in print. Like, why? Why shouldn't I be able to just pick the right number of moments for this scene, and let everything just reflow. Well, you can if it's just one long thing. JEFF SMITH: I was at The Festival of Cartoon Art at Ohio State in 1989 when Bill Watterson gave this famous speech called, "The Cheapening of the Comics," which was really about how comics in their glory days were full page sheets. A Krazy Kat ran at the size of a whole newspaper page. KAZU KIBUISHI: I was a big Bill Watterson fan, when I saw that, I was like, "Oh, yeah." Well, the web provides the ability to do whatever you want. And I was really inspired by a lot of Little Nemo in Slumberland, Slumber Land, all the Winston McCay stuff. And so, I made a conscious effort to try to bring back the Sunday strip using the infinite canvass... ...on the web. - Your panels are now the size of your screen. You can either have four in a row, or as many as you like, or tiny thumbnails, but you can blow those panels up to the size that they should be. And you can walk right into it and go for a ride. - There's no question that right now, we're seeing just a sea change in the relationship between artists and their audience. - When you are in the world of print comics, your role is to make the best print comics you can. When your job is primarily to be an interesting person with an interesting website, then you kind of have more options. - A person is invested not just in the strip, they're invested in you. - They feel a connection to you as an author. It's almost a camaraderie because when you update your website, you often talk to your readers underneath it. You're like, "Hey guys." There's a lot of great things that come with that. - Get up in the morning and there's usually one, two, three, four, five emails in your inbox from strangers telling you that they love your work, and therefore you. That's very easy to wake up to. - It's a weird kind of dance because you want them to be invested. You want them to be fully part of what you're doing. And at the same time there's only so far you can go. - People really do want to know everything about everything online. - They read your comics, they're like, and "That's good." And they might Google your picture right away and be like, "That's who it is." And look up you on Facebook and try to become your friend INTERVIEWER: And then it gets creepy... - And that sort of thing Don't do that. [LAUGHING] - There's this tremendous curiosity about, you know, what makes creative people tick and everything behind that. - I would love to be able to fade into the wings. That'd be a great thing. But you can't, you can't and be relevant. - I'm not as funny as Garfield , I'm not as interesting as Garfield, I created Garfield to really be entertaining, you know. So, I wouldn't have to. - Quite honestly, I tried to forget that there was an audience. I wanted to keep the strip feeling small and intimate as I did it, so my goal was just to make my wife laugh. After that, I put it out, and the public could take it or leave it. - I think that a lot of people we're seeing succeed now, it's because they have brought in a segment of the population who hasn't read web comics or is not present yet. And now they are here. - You have to appeal to the 80-year-old woman who's reading the comics page, and the 5-year-old kid who's reading the comics page. We don't have to do that on the web. - There's such a low bar to entry for cartoons. Obviously, it does let a lot of crappy comics in, but it also lets a lot of brilliant comics that wouldn't make it anywhere else. - Kate Beaton's a perfect example of that, right? She loves history. How fucking boring is that? If you told me there was a comic about books and history, I would flip you off. But I read it all the time. 'Cause she loves it! And you can't help but love it too. SCOTT McCLOUD: These people, they're their own nations. There's no longer the single global village or whatever of comics. But I like that, that's good. That's true of movies, that's true of prose, that's true of any art form worth its salt has different communities that don't talk to each other necessarily. - I'm really big into the idea that web comics are helping people discover comics as a medium. The average person in America, who doesn't read comic books, knows comics through three channels. They know about Archie comics from the supermarket, they know about Batman and Superman through general cultural diffusion, and they might know about newspaper strips if they read in the paper. Nothing against those three forms of comics, but each of these is a very particular genre. If you don't like Batman, you don't like Archie, you don't like newspaper strips, you might just say, "I don't like comics. Comics are for kids, comics are stupid, and they're not for me." I always have the analogy of a movie theatre in town that only ever shows three kinds of movies. And this guy who's lived in this town all his life and goes to a movie theater there again and again and keeps seeing romantic comedies, walks out after his 1,000th romantic comedy, you wouldn't forgive him for saying, "Man, I guess I just don't like movies." And web comics, 'cause they're free and accessible and online, someone can like one of your comics and just shoot a link to their buddy and say, "Hey, catch this out. I think it's funny." And I get emails from people saying, "I don't like comics, but I like yours." And I write back saying, "Surprise! You like comics. It's all comics." - There's lots of web strips. I don't know how these kids, and to me they're kids, I'm sorry if they're not kids, but how you make money. [VIDEO GAME MUSIC] ROBOT VOICE: Cartoonist needs food badly. CHRIS HASTINGS: What I do is I take a comic and I put it online for free. - It's very, very short. It's very entertaining. It's usually a series. So, you're gonna keep following it because you get addicted to it. - Because the comic is for free, I get a very large number of readers. - People always ask me, "What is your trick for getting lots of traffic from social media?" The disappointing answer I always have for them is just make things that people like. If you're in the right space, it'll get picked up. And if it's likeable on its own merit it will get on the front page of somewhere like Reddit, and people will read it. MATT INMAN: I sort of feel like the strip being free is my way of building an audience who likes me and wants to support me. And then eventually, will hopefully maybe, buy something from me, and support me in that regard. - I usually talk about the business model behind Saturday morning cartoons. It is a commercial for the merchandise. - 80 percent of my living comes from merchandise. HOWARD TAYLER: Once the audience is large enough, I could use the broadcast television model. - You have the commercials in between the TV shows. So it is the same as having, you know, the advertisers on every side of your website, whether you like it or not. - About 20 percent of my living comes from advertising. - All I've done is I've eliminated all the middlemen between me and the people who actually command my fee. - Right. [LAUGHTER] - And it's enough to actually make a living from it. - The future is wearing 20,000 different hats. - To be famous now, so to speak, is to be-- you can't be famous like this anymore. You've gotta be famous in a lot of little piles all around. A little Twitter, little blog, little Facebook, little in person, little through traditional book channels. - I think cartoonists becoming businessmen is rarely a natural step. - I wouldn't want to do all the business things. That would bring me down. - I think it's usually a necessary step. - Those who resist completely do so at their own peril. - I think that most of us do it with some reluctance. - I just want to wake up with like a big bag of money next to me and not have to ever really figure out how it happened. - And some of us, like me, do it badly. - I just can't stand that stuff. That's why I became an artist. All of it seems like math homework to me. - But it's healthy. It's just-- we just have to do it. We have to be adults and figure this stuff out. - I have a lot of respect for a lot of the web cartoonists how much you guys have to hustle. I mean, it's a lot of work. - I compare it a lot to hip hop. You know, rappers selling their CDs out of trunks and stuff like that. To me, it's sort of like syndicated comics are McDonalds, and web comics are the guy on the corner with the hotdog stand. McDonalds is always gonna be there. But those hotdogs better be damn good or he won't be there next week. - But you've self-selected your audience, because people who read your comic read it because they like your comic. I know Rich Stevens described it as how he can't be fired. Someone can fire him by not reading his comic, but he needs to be fired by 200,000 people. - You're taking on that burden so that you steer it, and you own it, and you have something beyond just 30 years of work that you have nothing at the end for. - You can, to the truest meaning of the word, be a self-publisher. - The only alternative really is-- meet the new boss, same as the old boss. We don't want that. INTERVIEWER: Right, right, right. - We've all heard horror stories of creators, particularly in comics, who've depended on somebody else to do all of that for them. And so many of those people have been taken advantage of. And I never want to be one of those people. I always want to know what goes into making that stuff happen. - We are Penny Arcade. Our subject matter is us. [LAUGHS] It's not video games. - They're about video games because that's what we like. But they're not always about video games, it's about us. - We tried to make so many comic books, but we couldn't do it. - Because they were comic books. We had not settled on the tasty shape. - Also, instead of working on a comic book, we would just play video games. - It did not occur to us that there was actually a middle way. - That's when the sort of bubble, the dotcom thing happened, right? That's when the whole eFront thing happened where we got purchased. They had tried to steal it from us. Somebody before the company went under released all of their internal chat logs. And I can read the conversations they're having about me. Like, "Alright, we're gonna fire Mike. We're gonna fire Jerry. We've got a new artist, he's already got two comics done." It's like watching villains in a movie plot your death. - Wring their hands together. - It's insane! And watching that I was like, "You sons of bitches. This is mine, I made this." And I think that, at least for me, made me realize how much I loved it. After eFront crumbled, we were like, "Okay, well, we quit our jobs. We have no money coming in. Before we go try to get our jobs back, let's just see if our readers will give us enough money to live." And we said, "We need a couple grand a month. If you pay us that, you'll keep getting Penny Arcade." - They paid us 10,000 dollars the first day. - ...the first day. - It worked. It kept working. But it was not reliable. - We never knew how much they would pay us. So the donation thing was cool, but you couldn't bet on it. You couldn't plan on it. We ran the site for a year that way. And that's when we met Robert. - I was a big fan of Penny Arcade, and I was a hardcore gamer myself, and I just loved what they were doing in terms of content. - And he came to us because Penny Arcade at that point was huge, right? - We didn't know. - We didn't know. But it was huge. And what he saw was a way to actually turn into a company and really make money. - Well, he saw a company. But it was not a good company. - In my mind I thought that these guys should be millionaires. - There's people who make things, there's artists, right? And then the people who know how to make money off of that stuff, right? And that's what the syndicate's were. For us, Robert knows how to make money off the stuff we make. ROBERT KHOO: Penny Arcade's model is not done evolving. I think that we've done some really smart things. And I'm sure that some of the things we've done people can learn from. But by no means is this the end game. - The reality is that this happened because we were just too stubborn to quit. Any rational person would have stopped. I'm so happy with where we are right now that I would not change a minute of it. INTERVIEWER: What makes you pessimistic about the future of cartooning? - I'm not pessimistic about the future of cartooning. I just don't know where it's gonna go. DARRIN BELL: Well, the paper's gonna go. MELL LAZARUS: I think newspapers are gonna come back, even if you have to print them off a computer. STEPHAN PASTIS: When people say "dead" or "dying," it's too big of a statement. Has it taken a huge hit? No doubt. - I think for a while anyway that newspapers are still gonna be here. - I don't think we're looking at any kind of death. I think that we're looking at a change. STEPHAN PASTIS: We're not gonna have major towns without newspapers. I don't think it's gonna happen. Now, might it be all digital? Yes. And you have to pay for it? Yes. I'm making a good living from this. Now, maybe in 10 years I'm entirely done, whether I want to be or not. But I suspect not. DAN PIRARO: When's the last time an entire industry of entertainment just went under because people have moved on to some other technology? You know, radio never died because of film and television. - I read interviews in the 1920s where artists and syndicate people were talking about radio. And they're saying, "Oh, radio is no challenge to us." And you could sense the nervousness in their voice. 1940s VOICE ON RADIO: For years, the point has been argued, will radio eventually supplant newspapers? BILL GRIFFITH: I don't think we're looking at a future without print, just as I don't think we're looking at a future without books. It doesn't mean the medium that's coming along kills the previous medium. They find their place side by side. - If the newspaper died tomorrow, comics would not die. They have survived for hundreds of years through different technology, different means of distribution. This is a painful one. It's painful for those of us that are involved in it and that love the old format. But there will always be cartoons. There will always be comics. - The way technology is advancing now, it's just crazy 'cause stuff just flips every two or three years, you know? Suddenly, you're just on to something else. - Twenty-five years, who knows how you're gonna be reading comics. BRIAN WALKER: Cartoonists are compulsively creative, inventive people that will come up with all kinds of new solutions. And I can see it happening. They can adapt to new technology, they can find new audiences, they can reinvent themselves. I've seen it happen over and over and over, throughout the history of comics. JEFF SMITH: Every five years, comics are doomed. Every five years. And they never are. - I think it's one of those mediums where it will always find a way. - People are going to want to read comics. Words and pictures, I don't think they're going way. How do we get it to the public? I don't know, I don't worry about that. - As long as there are people, cartooning will be here. - Well, if anything, I feel like we're in a rebirth of comics right now. - They're not dead, if anything I think they're gaining momentum. I think they're just changing into a digital space. - Cartooning is experiencing a kind of renaissance. - I think comics today have never been better. And I think it's because everyone has raised the bar, because they had to, because there's more out there. - I think there's never been a better time to be a cartoonist. - You know, it seems like once a week, I find a new comic that I want to start reading. - 50 years from now, 25 years from now, people will look at what is happening and will be able to say, "These are the best comics ever created." - They're great for our time. They're great attention span. They fit it perfectly. Got 20 seconds. - Where it's going is-- it's so exciting and I'm looking forward to it the way a kid looks forward to Christmas. Because I don't know what's out there and there's so many wonderful minds all working at once. - There is a whole generation of great cartoonists. Don't think the established cartoonists aren't looking over their shoulders, because that's what we talk about when we get together. - More people are interested in drawing comics right now than at any other point in history. - There is so much exciting work being done now. There are so many talented people who are unbound doing work that they love. They don't know what's right or wrong. It's like the young indie film makers, you know? And you get this stuff that no one's seen before, and it's amazing to me. And it's like, I think that's pure cartooning. - The platform might at this point be called web comics, but you may as well call them comic strips. I mean, that's what they're creating. They're creating comic strips no different from what Jim Davis was creating back in 1978 or what Bill Watterson was creating in '85. - I have a great faith in the versatility of the art form. I don't worry at all about the comics ability to stay lively and relevant. Comics are such a natural way to express yourself that one way or another I'm guessing they'll be around for a good while yet. - If you really love this, and this is what you want to do, just keep doing it. - The great news is that the more you do it, the better you're gonna get. No one starts drawing and gets worse. Everyone gets better. - Make something, put it on the web, it's easy, anyone can do it. Iterate, see what people like, if they think it's fun, keep doing it, if not, change it. - My advice has always been to just draw cartoons for the love of it, and concentrate on the quality and be true to yourself. Also, try to remember that people have better things to do than read your work. So, for heaven's sake try to entice them with some beauty and fun. - It's a wonderful job. - It's an amazing job. - It's the greatest job on earth, man. - My day-to-day job is to be a cartoonist. And for me, it's the only job I ever wanted. - This is a rare and wonderful occupation, and I feel so lucky and so fulfilled and fortunate that I'm allowed to do this. ♪ Pictures have been telling Stories for a long long time ♪ ♪ So I'm gonna tell you All about it with this rhyme ♪ ♪ Here we go ♪ ♪ If you go to Lascaux France ♪ ♪ You'd see paintings In a cave ♪ ♪ Next came Egyptian Hieroglyphics ♪ ♪ That Egyptians did engrave ♪ ♪ The Parthenon has marble ♪ ♪ That's carved to look Like dudes ♪ ♪ Okay I might be blushing ♪ ♪ 'Cause some of them Are nude ♪ ♪ Then came a column That was Trajan ♪ ♪ Looks like something big That's also ragin' ♪ Come on, get your mind out of the gutter: These pictures are ragin'. ♪ Because pictures Have been telling stories ♪ ♪ For a long long time ♪ ♪ Okay to clear your mind ♪ ♪ Next came stations Of the cross ♪ ♪ They star a guy named Jesus He's related to the boss ♪ ♪ Then Japanese stories scrolls Featuring a crane ♪ ♪ Then Bayeux tapestries that Will kind of blow your brain ♪ ♪ Then came stain-glass Windows ♪ ♪ Religious.
