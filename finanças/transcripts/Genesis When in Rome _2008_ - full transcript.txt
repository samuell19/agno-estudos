Especially Signor Tony Banks! Mr. Banks is here tonight, what a coincidence. And Mr. Mike Rutherford is here too! And we’ve got Daryl over there, Daryl! Chester up there. Okay, so let’s go. Well, the key to my survival was never in much doubt The question was how I could keep sane Tryin’ to find a way out Things were never easy for me Peace of mind was hard to find And I needed a place where I could hide Somewhere I could call mine I didn’t think much about it ’till it started happening all the time Soon I was living with the fear every day of what might happen that night I couldn’t stand to hear the crying of my mother, and I remember when I swore that that would be the last they’d see of me and I never went home again But they say that time is a healer and now my wounds are not the same I rang that bell with my heart in my mouth I had to hear what he’d say He sat me down to talk to me He looked me straight in the eyes and he said, "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine No, you’re no son, you’re no son of mine You walked out, you left us behind And you’re no son, you’re no son of mine" Oh, these words, how they hurt me I’ll never forget it And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine" But where I should go? Please, tell me what should I do? "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine, no" I came here for help and I was looking for you Well, the years, they passed so slowly I thought about him every day What would I do if we passed on the street? Would I keep runnin’ away? In and out of hidin’ places Soon I’d have to face the fact that we’d have to sit down and talk it over But that would mean goin’ back But they say that time is a healer and now my wounds are not the same But I rang that bell with my heart in my mouth I had to hear what he’d say Well, he sat me down to talk to me He looked me straight in the eyes, and he said, "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine No, you’re no son, you’re no son of mine You walked out, you left us behind and you’re no son, you’re no son of mine" Oh, his words, how they hurt me I’ll never forget it And as the time, it went by I lived to regret it "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine" But where should I go? Please tell me what should I do? "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine, no" But I came here for help and I was lookin’ for you "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine No, no! You’re no son" Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, yeah "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine, no" Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine, oh, no You’re no son, no son, no son, no son, no son of mine You’re no son, oh, yeah" Oh Oh "You’re no son, you’re no son of mine, no No son, no son, no son, no son of mine No son" Oh Oh Oh "No son, no No son, no" Oh "You’re no son You’re no son of mine, no No son, no son" Well, I must have dreamed a thousand dreams I’ve been haunted by a million screams Oh, but I can hear the marching feet They’ll be moving into the street Now did you read the news today? They say the danger’s gone away Oh, but I can see the fire’s still alight And they’re burnin’ into the night Well there’s too many men Too many people Makin’ too many problems And there’s not much love to go around Can’t you see, this is a land of confusion? Now this is the world we live in Whoa-oh-oh These are the hands we’re given Whoa-oh Use them and let’s start trying Whoa-oh-oh to make this a place worth living in Ah, Superman, where are you now? It seems everything’s gone wrong somehow All the men of steel and the men of power It seems we’re losing control by the hour This is our time This is our place where we look for the future And there’s not much love to go around Just tell me why this is a land of confusion Now this is the world we live in Whoa-oh-oh These are the hands we’re given Whoa-oh Use them and let’s start tryin’ Whoa-oh To make this a place worth livin’ in Well, I remember long ago Yes, when the sun was shining and the stars were bright all through the night And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight So long ago Oh Oh Oh Oh I won’t be comin’ home tonight ’cause my g-generation will put it right And we’re not just makin’ promises Oh, well, you know that we’ll never keep ’Cause there’s too many men There’s too many people makin’ too many problems And there’s not much love to go around Tell me why this is a land of confusion Now this is the world we live in Whoa-oh-oh These are the hands we’re given Whoa-oh Use them and let’s start showin’ Whoa-oh-oh Make this a place worth fightin’ for Yes, this is the world we live in Whoa-oh-oh These are the names we’re given Whoa-oh Stand up and let’s start showin’ Whoa-oh-oh Oh, just where our lives are goin’ to Oh Thank you very much! Okay. Because now we play... I got sunshine in my stomach Like I just rocked my baby to sleep I got sunshine in my stomach But I can’t keep me from creeping sleep Sleep, deep in the deep Rockface moves to press my skin White liquid turn sour within Turn fast - turn sour Turn sweat - turn sour. Must tell myself that I’m not here I’m drowning in this liquid fear Bottled in a strong compression My distortion shows obsession In this cave Oh Get me out of this cave Oh But if I keep self-control I’ll be safe in my soul And the childhood belief brings a moment’s relief But my cynic soon returns and the lifeboat burns My spirit just, just, just never learns Stalactites stalagmites Well, they lock me in and they held me tight Lips are dry Throat is dry Feel like burning, my stomach’s churning Well, I’m dressed up in this white costume Padding out leftover room Body stretching, feel the retching In this cage Oh Get me out of this cage Oh Caught in the glare of a light I see a strange kind of sight of cages joined to form a star Each person can’t go very far All tied to their things They’re netted by their strings Free to flutter In memories of their wasted wings Their wasted wings Outside the cage I see my brother John He turns his head so slowly around I cry out, "Help!" before he can be gone And he looks at me without a sound So I shout out, "John please help me!" But he does not even want to try to speak I’m helpless in my violent rage And a silent tear of blood trickles down his cheek And I watch him turn again and leave the cage My little runaway Raindrops keep falling on my head keep fallin’ on my... Raindrops keep fallin’ on my head keep fallin’ on my... Raindrops keep fallin’ on my head They keep fallin’ on my... Raindrops keep fallin’ on my... They keep fallin’ on my head If I feel a strap , dressed to kill Chances narrow that I’ll make it in this cushioned straightjacket Just like 22nd Street where you know they got me by my neck and feet Pressure’s building I can’t take more My headaches charge and my earaches roar In this pain Oh Get me out of this pain Oh But if I could turn to liquid I could fill the cracks up in the rock Know that I am a solid and I am my own bad luck Outside John disappears and this cage dissolves Without any reason my body revolves Keep on turnin’ Keep on turnin’ Keep on turnin’ Keep on turnin’ around Oh Keep on turnin’ around Oh Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Around Oh, somebody Somebody get me out of this cage Oh Get me out of this cage Oh Get me out of this cage Like the dust that settles all around me I must find a new home The ways and holes that used to give me shelter They’re all as one to me now Oh, but, I, I would search everywhere just to hear your call and walk upon stranger roads than this one in a world I used to know before I miss you more Oh, oh than the sun reflecting off my pillow Bringing the warmth of new life Oh, oh, oh And the sounds that echoed all around me I caught a glimpse of in the night Oh, but now, now I’ve lost everything I give to you I give to you my soul And the meaning of all that I believed before escapes me in this world of none with nothing, no one Oh, but, I would search everywhere just to hear your call and walk upon stranger roads than this one in a world I used to know before Oh, but, now, now, now, now, I’ve lost everything I give to you I give to you my soul and the meaning of all that I believed before escapes me in this world of none ’Cause I miss you more You know I miss you more, oh It’s 1:00 and time for lunch Hum-dee-dum-dee-dum When the sun beats down and I lie on me bench I can always hear them talk There’s always been Ethel Now, Jacob, wake up, you gotta tidy your room now And then Mr. Lewis Well, isn’t it time that he was out on his own Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds Cuckoo to you Keep them mowing blades sharp And I know what I like And I like what I know It’s getting better in your wardrobe Stepping one beyond your show Your show Your show Sunday night, Mr. Farmer called, He said "Listen, son, you’re wasting time" "There’s a future for you in the fire escape trade" "Come up to town" But I remembered a voice from my past "Gambling only pays if you’re winning" I had to thank old Ms. Mort for schooling a failure Keep them mowing blades sharp -and I know what I like -Yes, I know what I like -And I like what I know -Well, I like what I know You know, it’s getting better in your wardrobe Stepping one beyond your show -You know I know -I know what I like And I know what I like And I like, I like what I know Oh, it’s getting better in your wardrobe Stepping one beyond your show Your show You know that it’s your show You know that it’s your show Oh my, you know that it’s your show Your show Oh, when the sun beats down and I lie on the bench, I can always hear them talk.

Blood on the windows Millions of ordinary people are there They gaze at the scenery They act as if it is perfectly clear Take a look at the mountains Take a look at that beautiful river of blood The
