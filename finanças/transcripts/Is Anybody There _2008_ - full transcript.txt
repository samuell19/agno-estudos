I wouldn't mind being alone with that one in a one in a long dark railway tunnel. Can I get my wages, Kath? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Mum, it's very important. It's about recording ghosts. It's a ghost-hunter saying what he does when he wants to hunt them. Steve, come here. I think you want to say is, "darling, would you mind Coming here if you're not too busy." That's what I said. Why can't you watch the TV upstairs? No, you ordered me to come in there. The TV upstairs is haunted. Why don't you do it then? Please, darling. Because I came in there last time, dearest. Doesn't matter. And you didn't come over here last time. - Yes I did. - Why don't you listen? Sorry, love. Will you sort out the TV for him? Ena, you've just pitched all these knives and forks again!

We'll have to cheer this place up a bit. I'm very sorry for smacking you. You all right? Come here. You're very fortunate, you know. I never met my grandparents. And my mummy and daddy Are too far away for us to see them much. You've got all these old people around with all these amazing stories. It's a privilege. At least I think it is. Do you? Mmm.

Now, for those of you who have never before sat in a séance, there is absolutely nothing to be fearful of. Ghosts are very friendly sorts. They like a nice chin wag. But they're very scared of loud noises and sudden movements. Which is the reason why they are very rarely to be sighted in discos and wrestling matches, for example. You shouldn't joke. It'll make them vengeful. Spirits, please accept my mortal apologies. Now... Who are we hoping to contact tonight? Anyone. Okay, we'll try for anyone. Is there anybody there?

So you'll just have to settle for Mr. Knobhead here. Why'd you have to go and say that? - He'll find out sooner or later. - Let me go! Eddie. Some people don't die just like that. Not like Lilian. Some people, they take a bit longer. - They fade. - I know what senile is! There's still daddy and me, love. - We are not going to fade away. - Yes, you are! - Yes, you are! - Look, they're just clients. - You shouldn't get so involved. - What about you? - What? - Getting involved. Oh, Christ, Tanya. Don't go to university. If you stay here we could date. - Whoa, what? - Do you think I'm attractive? Hold your horses, Stevie. I'm 18 years old. - I know, it's fantastic. - Yeah, and what are you, like 45? No, I'm 39. Going on bloody geriatric. You don't want to have an affair with me, Steve. I can't support my family. I'm a rotten bloody father and terrible husband and nobody but you has a single bloody second for me. You're like a breath of fresh air, Tanya. I think I love you. I do. ( tape stops ) Dad: Yeah well, what about you, eh? Maybe if you paid me a bit of attention every now and again. Mum: What's the bloody problem with getting your head down And just getting on with it for a few months? Do you not see beyond the next nice pair of tits? I have never been unfaithful to you. Not in 15 years. You just undermine me, Steve. All the time you never do anything other than complain. It's exhausting. Why don't you just go? - Oh, come on. - I'm sick of it. Go on. ( car starts ) There. Oh. You look nice in that tie, Reggie. Thank you. But you never have it quite straight, do you? No no. We've got to straighten you out a bit in general, haven't we? Yes yes. I suppose so, yes. Come along. ( Knocks ) It's half eight, love. Come on, get up. I want to talk. Edward. Eddie? Barry: On Sunday, went to Edward's birthday party. There were a wizard who cut an old man's finger off. It were extremely wicked. An old person and a young person, please. 1.80. - That's a lot of ready cash. - He's my granddad. - Oh, are you? - Well, possibly. There have been many women. ( Honks ) When are we going home? Come on. I want to be where my stuff is. Come here. Oi, come here. Come here. That was a cheap bloody trick. Pull the red whatchamacallit. Too late, we're going. Pull the whatchamacallit. I'll pull it if you tell me what it's called. Well, I know it's red. What's a divorce like? - What? - A divorce. A bit tricky, I should think. Come on. Is it still there? What? - Is it? - What's the matter? Is the... Is the ground still there? Look, ground, sky. Ground. Ow! - Oi! - Concentrate! Any danger of a cup of tea and a pork pie? Did I already ask that? Thank you. Stay here. My name is Clarence Parkinson. And England is my nation. My teacher's name is Mrs. Scott. And Christ is my salvation. Clarence! Come here! That's the same name as my missus. I know. Oh no. Oh God. Oh, sod off. Sod off. ( Sobs ) Oh, sod off. Sod off. Put 'em down then. Put 'em down. Get it off your... Don't. Don't. You've spoiled them. Yeah. I've spoiled all these nice flowers, haven't I? It's all right. You know what it's going to say on my gravestone? "Here lies Clarence B. Parkinson. He was born. He F***'ed it up. And then he died. What's your name? - Eh? - Edward. Edward, Things aren't exactly as they ought to be. Have you any idea what it is? There's something the matter. The name on that gravestone is the same name as my wife. Leave it. I'm gonna go call my mum. You know, today's the first time we've spent more than half an hour with each other without a bloody fogey or shitty ass or liquidized bloody carrots getting in the way for a year. Because our kid's run off because he hates us so much because of what we do. No, it's... What we do is good. We didn't go to university, Steve. You asked me to marry you. We had a baby. Do you remember how much... Do you remember how hard we tried for him? Yeah. That was the journey we decided to make. And there might be a few less dates and I might end up looking like my mother, but... Sorry. It's not that way, love. It's just over here. - I thought I was outside. - Come on. You come with me. That's it. I mean, you argue with your mates sometimes, right? And obviously your mum and me sometimes... ( sighs ) I can be a grumpy bum. It's no fault of yours, love. It's just... are you not going to live at home? I don't know. But you must never think ever that you're not absolutely The most important thing in the world to your mum and me. Do you understand? When's he going to die? Look after him. Just let me look after everybody. I'm a little bit bored with you men and your problems at the moment, Edward. Sometimes you just have to learn to let things go. I know. Eve, where've you been? - Go back to sleep. - I've been looking for you - All over the damn place. - Oh God help us. There's another one here, another wild and woolly one who can't cope with himself. Annie, I'm sorry. That's all I wanted to say, to just tell you That I'm sorry... I got distracted. If I had my time over again... - If I had it again... - Shh shh shh. - Annie... - I forgive you. ( Softly ) I forgive you. Doc Brown: You know, Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really made a difference in my life. You've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing that I'm gonna be around to see 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this, that I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time... It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years Before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Marty: I'm really gonna miss you. Ace one, wasn't it? That one was magic. Hey, did you like the bit with the skateboard? I was there too. Oh no. You sure? Yeah. You coming in? A couple of minutes can't hurt. Hey, you did like it, didn't you? It was good, Dad. Can I have a word? Most assuredly. With him. Getting to be a bit Spring outside again, isn't it? It's October. The leaves are looking very nice on the, uh... The large plants you get in the garden. Trees. You're not doing that trick right. You've got to give it some patter. Words. - Why don't you just... - What do you call a man with a paper bag on his head? Russell. What do you call a man with a license plate on his head? Reg. What do you call a man with car on his head? Seatbelt? Good lad. - Can I have my fiver now? - Your what? You said you'd give me a fiver - If I got it right. - What a load of bollocks. ( Knocks on door ) Come in. - We have to be off. - Where are we going? Pictures. Tata for now. I was wondering whether you wanted to move back into your old room. I'm okay where I am. He was some magician, wasn't he? Wicked. ( laughs ) Oh yeah. He shoots, he scores! Come on then. Pass it! One out! ( laughs ) - Come on then! - ( groans ) Nice one, old man. ( Growls ) - Come on, magic man! - One out! Oh, look. Abracadabra. Oh. Edward: Where are you going? Out. That's all. You never go out. Well... Things are different now, aren't they? Why'd you have to put make-up on? Because... Oh, I don't know. It makes you feel a bit more human. You look like a vampire. ( Doorbell buzzes ) Cheers, big ears. You look nice. - You ready? - Yeah.
