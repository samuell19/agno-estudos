He's coming Let's do it Look at me, Paul. Stand tall. Brittle, edgy... A matador understands death... terror. A little anxiety... Clara, look down, be a bit submissive Not too much! A bit submissive to the man... At three, you look at me. It's all in the look At three, rise up, on your toes, and look at me One... Two... Three! Excellent! You think this is easy for me? You think I enjoy seeing you unhappy? I told you, I'm always like this With other girls it lasted a week, then for six months we did nothing Really? With you, it's lasted three months It's all we've done, night and day... Don't overdo it We never did it all night Come on... We made love over and over I don't think so In fact... We never made love at all Anyway... I can cheat on you. But you can't No getting a hard-on for another girl, if you don't for me Have you cheated on me? No You're lucky. You won't make me give up sex I haven't cheated on you, but I should have What does that mean? Look at me! Have you ever? Absolutely not! That's how stupid I am! You don't deserve my loyalty You know why you drink? So you can pass out whenever we get to bed You only love me when there's a table between us Since we met, we've been together every night You sit opposite me every night. And I'm never bored Like I said, you like me when there's a table between us It's insane! I sleep with a guy who doesn't touch me! You never touch me! - We talked about that - You promised you'd do something! - Just wait! - Until the end of the world? You have to wait! Maybe three more months! There's more to life than that! What are you doing? You going? No It doesn't matter Yes, it does An invisible weight, heavy, leaden, descends on me A constant nagging... Take off your T-shirt I don't want to sleep with a sack of cotton, I hate cotton No. Get undressed and come to bed Why won't you take it off? You know I hate it. Why rub my face in it? I'll take the shirt off, but not my shorts They keep my balls warm It's nothing to do with you I never thought we'd be together every night That's how it is It's my fault too I thought you'd have other things to do than see me every night We'd be apart for two weeks... a month... You'd let me disappear No Not without staying in touch... Not if you're in Paris when I am You don't trust me? I'll go If you want, I'll leave You'll never see me again See what I mean? We can't even talk Come to bed Take it off I said it's nothing to do with you I've always slept like this It's everything to do with me! It's because I disgust you Don't! I told you never to try that. You'll only make things worse But you're hard! Stop it, or we're finished It means you can I'm not interested Be nice. What's wrong with you? If you couldn't get it up, I'd understand You've decided to stop making love, just when I... Watch out! You want me to kill myself? I've never done this with anyone. I never touched them! Never! It must be important to you. You never shut up about it So you don't want to, you can't? I don't get it Touch me. If you can't get any pleasure, give me some! Women can come more often than men If I did that, I'd despise you. I couldn't love you any more You despise me because I'm a woman You don't love me at all! I disgust you, I make you sick You think I'm the dirtiest Stop it Come here Why can I only love him or hate him? Why can't I feel indifferent? But my head is clear A man who can't love me physically is a pit of misfortune, an abyss of suffering They say that a man who screws a woman, honours her The expression is worth noting: it's true Paul insults me Do you mind? Not at all Here for a nightcap? I just got up It's true. I just got dressed I can't stand sleeping, so I got up I don't give a damn about time, I'm never tired I hate people who fake tiredness, to make endless excuses You agree? It's because they lack passion You live alone? No, I'm married I told him I had a husband... So he'd know I wasn't free Because I'm not free He has to understand it's adultery He's asleep. Sleeping doesn't bother him at all! He has to get up early tomorrow A business appointment in Deauville at noon And you? You've got a girlfriend? She died in a car crash I haven't made love in four months Maybe all men are like that My husband's nice, but he's not interested in sex The first moves are what I like best It's delicious I can never stop myself yielding It surprises me each time I watch myself giving in as if it wasn't me It's true... I wanted another taste of the miracle: a stranger making love to you It's a childish longing... a pure desire... Suck me No. Not now Maybe later, or tomorrow Give me your phone number You don't want to? To blow you? Not really It's not my speciality I don't like to start with that, I'd rather start again that way, if you see what I mean But going to a hotel, I'm dying to do that Now I have to go, right away - You don't want to go to a hotel? - Of course, but I'm working And I have to return the car It's not mine You'll call me? Sorry I'm late Don't worry. I took the register Good morning Take out your grammar books, and write today's date Last week, we did the present tense of the verb "to be" "I am, you are, he is, "we are, you are, they are" Today, we'll do "to have" "To have" isn't like "to be" One can "be" without "having" And one can "have" without "being" I've been had I've really been had... I wish you were pregnant No chance of that! Why? It could happen How? By the Holy Ghost? You're kidding! There's been no chance, ever since I came off the pill I know you hate details, but dates matter If you hardly ever do it, and never on the right days, it won't happen That's what depresses me That's different If you say it's a duty call, no problem - Really? - Yes That would change everything If we had a child, it would make sense to be together It's because you've lost faith It'll come back It's like the Circean myth You want to know what lies ahead, what lies behind You won't allow the present to unfold You force things... You've lost faith, and everything collapses What if I left? And didn't phone for two weeks or a month? Six months? Would we be through? That depends... If you went to the North Pole, or to a desert, maybe... But if every time you see a phone and say "I won't call that dumb bitch", and hang out in every bar in my neighborhood, I'd say we'd have broken up I talk of freedom, you talk of bars It's statistics A guy needs to remake the world with his pals in a bar, or he dies You know I don't cheat on you Maybe I'd rather you did, and also screwed me Anyway, I can cheat on you, but you can't on me You've already done it? You talk about it a lot No But you deserve to think I have OK Tomorrow night, I'm eating with Ashley You can come, but you know what I'd prefer That I didn't come I know I should give him space But I need to cling to him like a leech Because I'm madly in love with him What he calls breathing suffocates me I never asked to be free And I don't want him to be I insist on absolutes And I think I'm right But when I apply them to life, I fall to pieces. Schizo He dances because he wants to seduce He wants to seduce because he wants to conquer He wants to conquer because he's a man What is it now? You pull this shit because I dance with some girl? Not some girl, a slut! Who gives a fuck about her? Then don't give a fuck! I won't have a kid with anyone else I really have to wear one? I haven't screwed in six months, I don't have AIDS You're getting better You seem to enjoy it You're almost triumphant! You want me to watch you slip on your condom At first you hid - Think so? - I do... I didn't dare look. I don't like looking at cocks Once they've been used, they're revolting Not very pretty They are rather disgusting It's like a Tampax. To screw, you take it out discretely, hide it under the bed so the guy's not turned off Guys are easily disgusted Later, you have to get it back I quite like disgusting things Know why most guys can't use a condom? Their cocks aren't hard enough It's as if, the rubber... rubs them out! I wouldn't know. I don't sleep with guys It's true. They go limp all the time Because... they're not really horny Just like in porn films Girls stuff limp cocks into their mouths They have to give blow jobs because they're not really desired A guy should take you without a word but he shouldn't burden you with his inadequacy Sometimes a blow job is fine It's OK When the guy could fuck you, but won't It's the torture of Tantalus It forces you to admit you can do that... or even worse... as long as he ends up fucking you Most guys have cocks that are short, thin, pointed Pointed? Like a dog's cock I hate that. Length isn't everything Width matters more A thin cock's ignoble You want it up the ass? Not yet Screw me some more, I haven't had enough My boyfriend doesn't fuck me How can you love a guy who doesn't fuck you? I don't love the guys who screw me. I hate them I don't want to see the men who screw me Or look at them I want to be a hole, a pit The more it gapes, the more obscene it is, the more it's me, my intimate part, the more I surrender It's metaphysical I disappear in proportion to the cock taking me I hollow myself That's my purity You like your back being tickled? No, I don't like tenderness Or to be kissed on the mouth. I couldn't stand that I don't care who fills my cunt But I can't kiss someone I don't love It's too intimate But I kissed Paolo, I felt like it When I kissed him, I stopped thinking about Paul So I decided to stop seeing him It was a question of integrity What are you doing? Nothing. I have a class You like my cock? I like its smell You're disgusting No, it smells good I like it that it's not too big It fits in my hand, and fits in my mouth Why do you like it? It's mine I don't know It's like a bird Feels like I've got a bird in my hand You see, when you move like that, it's as if it wanted to fly away But it doesn't. That's touching You mind that we don't go all the way? What I mind is you won't let me touch you I really resent that I do let you touch me. But not all the way Don't worry, I don't come either! Dictation "Winter Months" "Everyone had "settled for "a life that was dull "and orderly." Full stop "Then "suddenly," Comma "light "burst forth "once again" Full stop "Spring "had come!" Exclamation mark I know, my spelling is awful How did I pass my teaching exams? Or get my driver's license? I can't parallel park That's not so serious You're not behind me when I'm double-parked! I think I'm dis... lex... dis... lexic It's like with maths, my reasoning was fine, but I couldn't learn multiplication tables That's a problem Nice place! Surprises you? It's small, but there's nothing missing Women want to see what they've seen on TV Sliding Japanese screens are in, so that's what I have Jacuzzis are in, so I've got one For a small place, it has everything: like a theatre It's like a stage where I can rehearse I'm a classy bum who's not handsome, yet I've had over 10,000 women Why me? Because you have to talk to them Nobody bothers to talk to women anymore I talk, they listen, they're in the palm of my hand Then I put my hand in the right place... without asking... So it goes Somebody has to get things going The only way to be loved by women... is through rape Women yield easily to a stranger, but play hard-to-get with a wretch who loves them, who'd die for them, and swears he respects them So it goes But do they want to be respected? In a sense, yes But respect is in the nature of things: since they're up for grabs, they want to be taken I've had 10,000 women, I don't remember them all, but I kept their names, their age and the circumstances Women's cunts... No two are alike They're as memorable as faces. But take ten men, cut off their cocks, put them in a basket: no one can tell his own! I was on the radio They wanted proof of my statistics Yes, indeed They counted them Dr. Weil, a psychiatrist and sexologist, knows a true Casanova, a super Don Juan, a prince among seducers... Why does she call me a prince of seducers? It's absurd I never seduced anyone, any woman I know I'm not very handsome, I may even be revolting, but the fact is, I've had 10,000 women, several per day I've been a seducer in the sense of se aductere: to draw to one's self. To seduce Se aductere: to draw to one's self We checked him out He kept a record of his conquests... I've got something that will interest you I bought it, knowing some day I'd make you read it Here it is Read me this sentence One shouldn't lend books: women should read to us, so we know they've paid attention I hate reading Read it. Women must read to us "As the Mother begets the Son, the Son begets the Mother "His act is the creative counterpoint of the whole process "In begetting the Mother, he purifies her "He purifies her and himself, uno acto "He turns the Whore of Babylon into a Virgin" You're making me shy. What's come over me? Yet you're the one who... No. I'm fine You see? I don't see anything You're play-acting I'm being myself This kind of embarrassment... Completely natural ...is really desire It's part of the game... to forget words when they start to act otherwise it's too easy to tell them: "Hands off!" That's what this is, a trivial relationship, a very shameful one Why do men who disgust us understand us better than the ones we love? There's a hole in your education yet you're a teacher Yes, a hole There You're amazed that I'm fingering your pussy but it's me doing it I'm not aroused yet, but you are: you're amazed it's me So it goes Beautiful women are taken by ugly men That's a well-kept secret There has to be action, and the action isn't between man and woman, that's too simple It's between beauty and ugliness Beauty feeds on degradation, communes with it That's where I come in. I feast on it So it goes Don't blame me You'd like me to dominate you? Open your eyes Shall I gag you? It implies going further than it's reasonable for a woman to accept She may have to go beyond what she agreed to You don't yearn for what you can't accept Physical love... is the trivial clashing with the divine It's strange Obscenity doesn't bother women Does it hurt? Take it off I can't stand it... I didn't realize... You should've told me. I thought we could go a long way I can tie you up less severely Or we can make love normally I'm OK It's me... The problem is... You know Nobody ever tied me up before I've never done it Really? Never? I always wanted to We'll resume. I won't tie you so tightly No It's fine There's no other way Really? Was it good for you too? For me it was very beautiful, truly beautiful I want to give you pleasure. When you cry, I panic I feel I've done something wrong No, it's fine At first... you feel your hands going numb... you think you can stand it... then suddenly it's unbearable... A way of dying... a galloping death... You think your hands will fall off... you turn slowly into dead flesh... and then it has to stop at once, it can't last a second more I was afraid you couldn't hear because of the gag It's really strange But you liked the gag? I don't like having to say things... When I got home, Paul wasn't there That caused my world to fall apart It has nothing to do with what I did What's done is done. It's behind me My head is very clear It's all I can count on My head My body feels like it doesn't belong to me It's an appendage, anonymous In my head, there's Paul He could have reconciled me with my body But he didn't want to do that Because I didn't like my body I was easy prey A victim Women are the victims men sacrifice in expiation I always masturbate with my legs closed, I rarely part them I can offer myself to myself, rape myself It's mildly satisfying, a bit nauseating, but it's proof I don't need a man if I have to resort to this It was painful for me to be on his bed I felt like a piece of lost luggage The more time went by, the less I could bear it I had to cast myself out on the streets like a wreck Like a wreck, belonging to anyone The only thing I told myself, like a two-bit equation, was that if I'd cheated on him, and still only loved him, it didn't much matter if he'd cheated on me But he hadn't It was worse He was thrilled to be alone Love between men and women, I'll say it again, is a devious conflict There If I get home after him, I've won I know it. I'll have the edge A tenner, just to eat you That's my dream To know that for some guy, I'm just a pussy he wants to stuff No sentimental bullshit Just raw desire To be taken by a guy, anyone A nobody, a bum with whom you wallow for the joy of wallowing, for the dishonour, the shame That's pleasure for a girl - Turn over. Show me your ass - Pay me! You've got no choice, bitch! You like me? Slut! Whore! Bitch! I reamed you good! I'm not ashamed, asshole! Is nymphomania destroying yourself because you choose the man who doesn't love you? I don't want to sleep with men I want to be opened up all the way. When you can see that the mystique is nothing but raw meat, the woman is dead! Maybe I really want to meet Jack the Ripper He'd certainly dissect a woman like me! Once again I hung around for an hour so I'd get home after him Proof that women are capable of greater love than men Much greater love He's waiting for me, too When I get home after him, it's not as easy The little guy's edgy - I just got home - Me too So I see But I just got home too Sure... You wouldn't watch crap TV for an hour "A Love Affair deals with an older man's obsession with a young prostitute" So he won't screw me... "Maybe due to his education, "women always seemed alien to him "He preferred the company of his friends "Women were from another world, "somehow superior..." My cunt is swollen, moist: I can hold out forever He won't beat me down this way When he wants an evening without me, I make the most of it I get tied up It's his fault Shall I dominate you? Want to tie me up? Today you choose I don't want to do anything You like being tied up? Yes, but not my elbows Last time, my hands were numb for two weeks A month ago, one elbow still felt weird That's not normal. You've got bad circulation One day in Cannes, I picked up Grace Delly If I'd known it was her, I wouldn't have dared But she liked me and made a date to meet at my place She rings, blonde, impeccable hairdo, in a dog's tooth suit. A bitch for a hound dog! I screw her, love in the afternoon, she leaves in fine spirits Next day I see her, I was with a friend I tell him, "I screwed that woman" He says, "You screwed Grace Delly?" I just looked at him. I didn't know See? I'm not handsome or wealthy or even attractive, but I screwed her Later, I go over to her, we have a drink, and I ask her: "Why?" "Why didn't you say you were Grace Delly?" She replied, "Would you have behaved like you did?" I guess not You don't act like that with Grace Delly You wear kid gloves! It's a pity! That was nice Wait... This doesn't hurt Too bad, I don't have two It doesn't matter I'll do it this way Raise your ass I'll pull up your skirt Like that I'll spread your legs, OK? I think you like it when I spread your legs Wait I love it There That's nice Now I'll put this on Wait... Help me! That's beautiful! You're lovely like that You're very beautiful Now I'll gag you I enjoyed it so much, I grew fond of Robert Tying me up without tying me down, was the secret of his ritual After our sessions I was never depressed. We giggled We went out, ate too much ...the guy was flat broke, so she said to him... You want more caviar? More caviar? Waiter, please! More caviar! And vodka! I love to drink But I never get drunk, or what they call drunk Can we have some more vodka? You seem fine You see your pals. I see my girlfriends I bet you badmouth us! We badmouth you, we do, we don't... Help me? Touch me I can't. You kept them on If that's all it takes... Love is a bitch It's just a power trip A guy you're faithful to, won't fuck you Cheat on him, and he screws you They don't guess you're cheating, they sense you're getting away My hands are dead. I can't do a thing Now what? What are you playing at? Why can't you see I only do this with you? I've never touched anyone else's cock Then why won't you leave me alone? Because you do nothing Now you be me You be the woman I'll be your guy, I'll screw you Can you believe it? That's how that selfish bastard got me pregnant! Nobody came, not even him He pulled a Virgin Mary on me, with a drop of seminal fluid Spread your legs. Relax. There... The neck is closed. Good. The uterus is... It's been eight weeks Your turn That's how I became a case study for spotty interns A slab of meat Once you're pregnant, they spread your legs and peer all the way up your vagina Strangely I took a bitter liking to it As I'd made a truce with Robert while I was pregnant, nobody else touched me My monthly visits were the only sex I had I'm uneasy on an exam table, I resent spreading my legs That's why it upsets me: I'm a bit of an ice-maiden I see why the Chinese used an ivory dildo to probe you Though even that's distasteful Porn movies, too, protect your libido. You watch a surrogate image But what you can't tolerate in life, you can't tolerate in images either An image is just as compromising, since it stands for you Very good Paul is right You can't love a face when a cunt tags along Cunts and faces don't mix I fantasize about a brothel, where heads are separated from bodies, by a machine like a guillotine before the blade comes down Of course, there's no blade I wear a silky red skirt that billows up and rustles And those silly trappings that give men a hard-on It's proof a hard-on doesn't mean they love us Paul is right, being a woman has a fatal flaw If she gets you hard, you want to screw her Wanting to screw her is to despise her Love between men and women is impossible Men you can't see, you imagine coarse and ape-like Aziz, look at my cock! As if crudeness is all one can expect There we see the head That was the spine The femur Want to know what it is? It's a boy Fabulous You want me to marry you? Yes That night, Paul made love to me for the first time in ages And for the last time From then on he dragged me around like a ball and chain, a duty he had to endure We went out every night with his sister and brother-in-law Now that I was the mother of his son, I'd met his whole family You OK? Two whiskies! - You OK? - Fine Want another drink? Later Please don't make a scene Don't worry I felt like dancing, so I grabbed a girl I almost kissed her, she was so hot for me Then I dumped her where I picked her up She never knew what happened You can't complain I didn't But you wanted to A whisky, please! You two fallen out of love? You look like a couple of squares! Sit down Feeling tired? I'm fine She's my sister, but I'll tell her A man likes a challenge He hates being followed around He needs to fear he may lose her. Then he chases her Or chases someone else A man's always chasing You agree? You and your chasing's a bore The bastard! He leaves me alone with the fear that soon my vagina will open and spit out the baby Wake up! I'm sick of your boozing! You slob! You stupid tart! Coming down What's going on? You'll like it Get on the table. Wait for the contraction to pass Breathe deeply Breathe. Once it's over, get on the table - The father can't stay - Yes, he can! Don't I get an epidural? It's too late, your baby's being born Ready? We're going to push the baby out. Breathe in! Breath in! Hold your breath, grab the bar Push hard! Again! As hard as you can. Hold your breath. Again! It's incredible to create life Breathe in! Hold your breath and push Go on! They say a woman isn't a woman until she's a mother. It's true Nothing that happened before really matters For Christine Pascal I gave my son his father's name If someone up there's counting souls, then we're even Subtitles: Gorse Processed by C.M.C.
