It's my house and it's my rules. He's got to learn. Now... ..I won't have some nancy boy embarrass this family again, you hear me? You need to toughen up. (Repeated blows) Are you not ready yet? - Mm. - Zip me up? Only because we're running late. You're still a beautiful woman. Maybe we should stay in. I'm worried about Richard. I checked on him. He's fine. Don't you want to have fun anymore? Let's go. That's my girl. I'll go get the car. (Door shuts) (Door opens) You take those off. This is not what boys do. Do you understand? - Ev! Hurry up. It's disgusting. Ev! (Starts engine) (Door shuts) Maggie Tabberer, Model of the Year. Divorced with two kids. - Are you Richard Byron? - Yes. Pleased to meet you, sir. Now there's one I haven't been called before. My name is Christopher. This is my favourite department store. It's very glamorous. The window displays are beautiful. Thank you. You know, I designed them. Truly? My mother says they look like postcards. And this is the airless shoebox where we create the magic. Welcome to the scenic department, lovey. This is Danny, although she prefers 'Ava.' You have to start with a good base. Then you add colour to accentuate the features. Mm. You're a natural. Ava? Get your bum over here. I need inspiration for the spring windows. What do you think about a European-postcard thing? He's bossy. You get used to it. When he calls you Ava... Ava's the woman I am when I dress in drag. So, you wear ladies' clothes? And look fabulous. - Where's my First Lady? - Here! OK. Like that. Suck it in. Mm-hm. Hold tight, hold tight. I don't need adjusting. - How tight do you like it? - Tight. What do you think, Richard? Richard? Not going to tell us about your first day? You've forgotten your manners again. So, how was it? I got to help with the window displays. Well! Lucky you. I told them you said they look like postcards. Did you? So they're going to do a postcard theme for spring. And I saw Maggie Tabberer. What was she like? She was so beautiful, Mum. Everybody was watching her, and she was practising her walk. What's it like? Show me. - The walk? - Yes. It was like... Sometimes I wonder where all this talent comes from. My mother was all sensible shoes and Hail Marys. She's still waiting for the Good Lord to strike me down. That's a really beautiful coat. Want to try it on? No. Well, keep watch. Miss Monroe's got nothing on me. You sure you don't want to try it on? No, I'm not like you. Oh, lovey. You just want to be normal. I am. I can see who you are. Come on, I want to show you something. Oh. It's all about the eyes. That's what they want. Remember that? It's what every man looks at. It's what they want to see. How do you find shoes that fit? We work in a department store, lovey. You look really good. Your turn. Honey, I'm home! Ssh! Richard's in there. Stop the presses. He's going through the change. Oh! Carol - How much longer do we give him? - As long as he needs. He's probably torn between the soft silk and the taffeta. Yeah, that'd be it. Do I look OK? You, my darling, are beautiful. Don't you dare cry, Richard, you'll ruin my make-up. This person cannot be called 'Richard.' She... ..needs a name. ♪..no matter what you do ♪ Oh! Carol. ♪ Carol! That's a name. We are taking Carol out. Big step! Three G & Ts, please. She's so beautiful. Yes, he is. They're so confident. That's what drag is, lovey- hiding in the spotlight. - When are you going to get up there? - In good time. Promises, promises. Here we go. Hi, I'm Mick. I don't suppose you'd like to dance? - We were just about to have a drink. - She'd love to. What's your name? Um, Carol. Carol. Let me have a look at you. You're a knock-out. Um... No, I... Come on. Come on, let me feel it. - I know where you're going. - Hey, stop! Stop it! Carol? Carol, what happened? He touched me. What do you think he wanted to do, play Scrabble? Well, it's not right. I'm not a poofter. What time do you call this? - We just went dancing. - We? You and your fancy new friends? What is this? You've been wearing make-up. Outside the house? You think it's funny? Because it's not. It's not natural. Well, maybe it is for me. You need to stop this rubbish. You are a young man now. What are people going to say? You're a crap mother. Richard? You have no idea what I gave up for you. What was that? I married Ted to give you every opportunity. You married that bastard because nobody else would have you. Oh, darling. They all wanted me. They didn't want you. Is that why you left me with the neighbours for ten years? Go to bed. You should have just left me there. You stop this filthy business or get out of my house. I won't have you do this to me again. I won't. - Oh, my records! - There's no time. Thunderclouds approaching. Oh, dear. Hello, love. What do you think you're doing? Tell her, Richard. Moving out. Get inside. - We should go. - You get inside, now. Let him go, Ev. We're better off without him. Do you really want to go off with these people? - They're my friends. - How dare you upset your mother? If you want to go, go, but don't ever come back! We'll take good care of him. What would you know about taking care of him? More than you. Come on, let's go. Get in the car. You alright? Never better. Sammy? I've been working on a few of my routines, and I think if you give me a chance to show you... Brunettes are bad for business. But Sammy, Mr Lee... You got no va-va-voom, kid. Sammy, Ava's done her ankle. She can't go on. Since when? Twinkletoes got her heels caught in her pantyhose. Ah, shit.

You're much more elegant when you keep your mouth shut. God, Sammy's going to throttle me for insulting customers. - Is that right? - How was that... ..enough va-va-voom for you? Sammy, we hear you're opening a new club. Les Girls. Yes, and we want to audition. So do all the other camps in the Cross. Yes, but they don't already work for you. We know you. We know you expect the best. And we'll do it cheap. - You won't be paid until you get in. - You won't be disappointed. You'd better show me something special too, like those clubs in Paris. Oh, we will. We're going to knock you on your arse. Your bum. Don't thank me yet. You haven't met Sheila Cruz. Ready, ladies? A five, six, here we go. A one, two, three, four. Shoo the ducks, shoo the ducks. Kick to Kellett Street. Next group. And a one, two, three, four. Shoo the ducks, shoo the ducks. Good. And like a gazelle. Light and graceful. Gazelle, dear. Gazelle, not hippo. Oh, never mind. Next one. Oh, my God. She hates me. Here we go. Ah, now. This is a gazelle. Gazelle? More like a baby giraffe. That's little Miss Peggy Perfect. And OK, into the grapevine. Come on! Starting slow. And a one. And two. And one. And two. Her, pass for a girl? Wouldn't have thought so. She's a country kid in a bad panto wig. Stop! - Problem? - No, Miss Cruz. No problem. We were just helping... - ..Peggy. - Peggy. Five, six, seven, eight. Loosen the shoulder without losing the line. Where'd you dig up the big-mouth brunette? I know- moment of weakness. You're shifting your weight too early. It's on four. Shoo the ducks, shoo the ducks. One, two, three. Four. Have you got it in for me? Oh, you think I was too hard on you. - You know why? - 'Cause I'm a hippo? No, because your attitude stinks. Picking on another girl? Whew! You wouldn't do that if you weren't scared. What are you scared of? I really want this, Miss Cruz. - Why? - Because I want to dance. No. You want them to love you! Hm? The stage is our boudoir. The audience, our lover. Do it right, and it will be the most enduring love affair. What if I'm not good enough? If you give them everything - your imagination, your body, your beautiful face... ..you can be anything you want up here, hm? But lose the smart mouth at rehearsals. Yes, Miss. And do something about that voice. Yes, Miss Cruz. Sheila. He has asked me to stay again tonight. I think he's the one. - You be careful with that one. - I'll be alright. You're writing to your mother again. Mm-hm. We could go and visit her. I'll go with you. It's a bit late for that. I know you miss her. OK, you go have a lovely night. - Love you. - Miss you. Mean it'. Legs. Angelo. Hello? Mum? It's me. Richard? I wanted to let you know I'm OK. Mum? In two years, all I get is a handful of postcards, now you want to talk. I called because I want to let you know I'm going to be in a show. It's a cabaret. It's not definite, but... I thought, if I get it, you might like to come. What's that? I can barely hear you. Are you having a party? You know Ted. Look, now's not the best time. How about tomorrow, then - lunch, my shout? Maybe next week. I'll let you know. Lovely dress. Thank you. I made it myself. Richard? Mum. - I have to go. - Mum, come on. - Let me go, Richard. - Please, let me explain. - Mum? - Don't you dare'. Don't you dare call me that. You're not my son, not like this. You need help. - I didn't come here to fight. - Didn't you? No, I came here to show you who I really am. Mum, this is who I've always been on the inside. You know I was never like the other boys. This is not my fault. I'm not blaming you. We play the hand we're dealt, Richard. Yes, that's right, and Richard wasn't me. This is me. This is right. My name is Carol. I don't want this for you. No, you don't want this for you. You play dress-ups and make-believe all you like... ..but you'll never be a real woman. It's not polite to stare. You can talk. It is strictly look but don't touch. I was hoping he wasn't one of yours. 'Cause yours is so different than mine? I like the manly type. He's a gold-digger, Carol. Even if he did like boys, you couldn't afford him, darling.

We wanted to meet you. You are too sweet. You like Natalie Wood too, non? Such elegance, she has. Is it true, about the operation? You want to see my foufoune? - You'll show us? - Of course. I am French. Did you see how real it looked? It was like she was born with it. No-one would know she wasn't the real thing. Imagine Angelo if you came home with a foufoune like that. - Lovey! - What? You're not actually thinking of having the op? - I would'. - You heard what happened to Sheena. She died on the table in Cairo. But it is something to start thinking about if they ever start doing it here. Not me. No way. I'd have the hormones over the op. It's less risky. ♪ You're sitting there wondering what it's all about... ♪ - Run, run'. Go'. You, with me. I have some questions. Get away from me'. She's new. Let her go. Take me.

How do you plead? Not guilty, Your Worship. I beg your pardon? Not guilty, Your Worship. Which part of the charge do you not understand? Any of it. You do understand that a custodial sentence would not be a pleasant experience for someone like you? How is you, sitting up there in your wig and robe, any different to us, sitting here in ours? Charges dismissed. You're free to go... ..Miss Byron. Here it is. What a dive. When they start handing out hormones at The Sebel, no questions asked, we'll go there. - Now come on, we're late. - Stop pressuring me'. You can buy tits and all the make-up you want, but we're still going to be... ..us. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... Lovey, I just don't want us to rush into anything. I thought you wanted a knock-out pair of boobs? Listen to me- we can start making the outside match how we feel on the inside. I just don't know if I can go through with it all- the hormones, the operation. Darling, if you can't do it, no-one can. Now, come on. I promise mine won't be bigger than yours. Here we go. And right, two, three, four, five, six. Again. One, two, three, four, five. Forward and present. And smile. Only a few days to go. Let's get it right. Gazelle. And gazelle. Alright.

I'm going to the bar. So, when is the big day? My invitation must have got lost in the mail. We had fun, Carlotta. Let's not pretend it was ever going to be more than that. Fun, fun, fun. That's me. Mary doesn't know about us, so... Don't worry. I won't tell her what a lying, cheating gold-digger you really are. She looks smart. She'll probably figure that out herself. They're much more interested in, you know, my going to bed with someone or my having VD or my getting a divorce than they are in the actual issues which I've come here to... Bra burners. He married her, you know. What, Germaine Greer got married? No, Ted and his floozy. Do we have to talk about bloody Ted again? He was good to us. No, not to me, he wasn't. He was a prick. A bit of discipline never hurt anyone. So, did you... ..did you see they might start doing the op at the Prince of Wales? This one's got no idea. Well, I fancy the convict story. I was thinking about having it, the change. How do they get on these game shows? That's what I want to know. Now I won't know who won. You heard what I said. I don't understand why you'd butcher yourself like that. Everything about me is female... ..everything except... OK, you can get dressed. The electrodes measure genital reaction to stimuli. Could you put these on, please? We need to know how you'll adapt post-surgery. You know what I do for a living. How was that? Womanly enough for you? He dumped me. It'll be Sammy, calling to sack me.

I'm sure it's a jewel, Carol. It is so worth it. Darling, it's going to be exactly the same for you. What's wrong, have those hormone pills got you off-colour again? No, I stopped taking them. It just wasn't for me. Well, you can't chicken out now. It's not what I want. You want people to see you as a freak for the rest of your life? - Because that's how they're going to... - Carol. - Oh, my God. - Pegs'. You are even more famous. What? 'Balmain boy becomes beauty.' I said, no press. - Photographers. - Oh, hello (!) Nurse, can we get someone in here, please? Bye-bye, boys. Nurse'. Smile, love! You can't hide forever. Watch me. You sound like you're premenstrual, Carol. - Where's Ava? - Probably sleeping one off. You can't tell me you haven't noticed the bender she's been on. She enjoys a martini. We all do. No, let me get it. What's really going on with Ava? Angelo has shacked up with some stripper from The Pink Pussycat. God, he's a prick. Who is it? I had to read about it in the paper. It happened quite suddenly, in the end. They said it takes over a year, what with all the testing. Yes. Well, I did try to tell you. All the neighbours are talking about it. How do you think that makes me feel? Oh. Like it's the end of the world. We are who we are, Richard. People don't change. Don't know about that. If you're so proud of yourself, why are you cooped up in here? Don't worry, I'll keep your cheques coming. You don't know what it's like, everyone knowing my business. Now you're worried about what people think'. I thought you'd like it - your name in the paper, everyone talking about you. No, I don't. Not like this, no.

How are you going? You have to play with me. I guess he has to, then. - Moselle, Carol? - Yes, thank you. Peter tells me you're a dancer. Anything I would have seen you in? - No. It's just chorus stuff, mainly. - Oh, nice. Aunt Carol, you have to come and play. What are we playing? Monopoly. You two would make beautiful kids. Mum'. Stop it. I'm allowed'. Come on. Are you serious? Mum, don't scare her off. Leave her alone. It's so nice to meet you at last. It's lovely to meet you too. Cheers. Well, it's happened.

Some old photos. - Give me a look. - No. - Hey'. - Come on'. - Peter! - Let me... Don't be an arsehole'. Hey'. - Carol... - No! It's OK. I don't want you looking at that, please. Is that you? I was being serious when I said I don't want you looking at that. It's disgusting. Hey. Hey'. - It's OK. - Thank you. It's OK. I don't want to remember that anymore. Carol? - What? - Listen to me. What? Marry me. Don't be stupid. Come on, be my wife. You know it's not even legal. - It wouldn't mean anything. - It would to me. You realise we'd be lying to everybody we know - your mother, everyone? Hey'. Be my wife. My God, you're being serious, aren't you? Can you ask me again? Marry me. I know you didn't want a fuss, but since your mum couldn't be here, my mother gave me this on my wedding day. Oh, no, Faye. I can't. It's too much. And I said it was too much. And one day you'll pass it down to your daughter... ..or daughter-in-law... ..and she'll say it's too much, and you will say, 'You're my daughter... ..and I love you.' Thank you. Something old. It's beautiful. Do you take this man to be your husband? I do. And do you take this beautiful woman to be your wife? Yes. I do take this beautiful woman to be my wife. ♪ Jingle Bell Rock Come here. I want to dance with my beautiful wife. Do you miss it? No. Would going back to work make you happy? You make me happy. Is it enough? ♪ What a bright time It's the right time ♪ To rock the night away... ♪ I told you, I don't want it'. Fine. Die of bloody heatstroke, then. See if I care. Don't be melodramatic. Nothing is ever good enough for you, is it? You love putting me down. Because you're a show-off'. I'm a show-off? Ever since you started with your little-wife routine. Now you drag that thing in here for all the neighbours to see how well you've done for yourself. You're jealous'. You are. When have you ever stood up for me about anything, ever? Not once. Not once. You've never been on my side about anything. Wow. You actually let me believe it was my fault you couldn't love me. Pegs, I'm so sorry I left you in the lurch like that. Mm. I could have stuck pins in your eyes. Maybe that tour wasn't meant to be, eh? What about you? You got yourself a bloke now, or... But I'm happy. You? Yeah. Carol... I don't know, Pegs. I just don't know where I fit in. Well, if you want to come back, I have a tour of New Zealand coming up, and I'm a girl short. Come on. They miss you, Carol. You'll still pack them in. I should go, but it was really good to see you. Offer stands. Bye. Alright, guys, come on. Let's lunch. Let's do it. Come on. Having kids is the most wonderful thing you can do, isn't it, Jane? Yeah, but there are days I could just strangle the precious little darlings. Don't let them hassle you about Easter. We don't know what we're doing yet. Actually, we were just discussing what's taking you two so long to make me a grandmother again. - There's plenty of time for that. - Bunkum. I know there's something going on. I see it in Carol's face every time the kids come over. It's me. I don't want them. You can't wait to have children'. You told me so when you met Carol. Yeah, well, I've changed my mind. There's more to life than screaming babies and dirty nappies. I'm just going to finish up the salads. If there's a problem with your plumbing, there are so many things they can do nowadays. Mum, stop it'. Mum, it's none of our business, really. OK? - It's not your career, is it, Carol? - No. Not having kids is not about my career, Faye. You don't know the half of it. Carol, don't. Don't what, Peter? I can't have kids because I don't have the plumbing. Because I was born a boy. That wasn't fair. Every day. Every day, do you know what I'm surrounded by? Mothers. Mothers and their kids. My whole life is screaming at me, 'You're not a real woman.' And you don't know what that feels like. You're a real woman to me. No, that's who you should be with. That's the thing. You should be with a real woman with real ovaries and real bits. - I chose you. - It's not enough. It's not enough anyway, this whole happy-families routine. I can't do it anymore. I don't believe that. Come on, what did you think was going to happen? We'd end up happily ever after? That doesn't happen for girls like me. I thought that you'd have the guts to see it through the hard times. Well, maybe you don't know me as well as you think you do. Right. So that's it, you just walk off? That's it? Look at me. I love you. I know you love me too. I really want you to go be happy. Hi, this is Carol. Leave a message. Hi. Carol. It's Jane. I thought you'd want to know. It's about Peter. I christen you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Carol. Your baby's really beautiful. She must take after your wife. You still wear it. This... ..this is for your wife and her daughter, and I think it's better if they never know about me. It's good to see you. You too. And now. ladies and gentlemen. after three years touring the world. Les Girls is proud to present the return of a truly great star. the beautiful, the talented, the unforgettable Carlotta. Ready? No sign of Evelyn. I didn't bring my chequebook, of course not. I am so proud of you. We all are. - Go get 'em. - OK. Hello, darlings'. Alright, alright. Pipe down. We'll be here all bloody night. Oh, hello, handsome. You're a good sort, aren't you? What's your name, sweetheart? It's George. How old are you, George, 22? Why do I suddenly feel ancient? You're only as old as the Adonis you feel, right? Auntie Carlotta will take care of the jokes, thank you, Gorgeous George. I'll tell you what, it's funny what coming home does to you. It really makes you think about how and why you got started in the first place. For me, I think it's really always been about love and acceptance. It's always been about love. - We love you, Carlotta. - Oh, thank you, darling. I love you too. When it's all said and done, the only person whose love really matters is mine. And if someone else chooses to love you, well, that's a bonus. ♪ Sometimes when I feel afraid ♪ I think of what a mess I've made of my life ♪ Crying over my mistakes ♪ Forgetting all the breaks I've had in my life ♪ I was put on earth to be ♪ A part of this great world is me ♪ And my life ♪ I guess I'll just add up the score ♪ And count the things I am grateful for in my life ♪ This is my life ♪ Today, tomorrow love will come and find me ♪ But that's the way that I was born to be ♪ This is me ♪ This is me ♪ This is my life ♪ And I don't give a damn for lost emotion ♪ I've such a lot of love I've got to give ♪ Let me live ♪ Let me live ♪ This is my life ♪ This is my life ♪ This is my life. ♪ Captions by CSI Australia :: Re-synchronisation ferneiva ::
