You're wasting your time, pal. He put aside his instrument long ago. ls that his? - He hasn't touched it for 20 years. Why are you looking for him? - l have to give him something. Hand it to me, l'll make sure he gets it. l have to give it to him personally. l don't think he'll want to talk to you. What's the deal with him? What did you say your name was? - Amram. Listen carefully, Amram. He is a loner, doesn't mingle with the crowd. He comes here twice a week to take these groceries. ls he an alcoholic? - Who? -Tawilla. Of course not. He drinks normally. lt doesn't affect him, either. - What do you mean? His body doesn't absorb it. He can drink as much as he wants. Doesn't he get drunk? - No, he doesn't. l've never seen anything like it. Someone's here to see you. He came from far away. What does he want? - l don't know. Leave me alone, l'm not up for it. l'm not in the mood for anyone. Just talk to him. l'm sorry. What do l do? You wait. Be patient. Can l play some music? - Go ahead. Do you have a Synthie? - A what? A Synthesizer. - You kidding? We don't use plastic here. How do you know this tune? l know it since childhood. l know only one person who could play like that. Who was your teacher? Who are you? - Amram. Amram? Are you Avram Mufradi's student? l'm his son. His son. How is he? - Not well. What's wrong with him? He got the disease in his lungs. How's he doing? You could say he's near the end. l'm sorry. "The Ballad of the Weeping Spring" They used to do 15 shows a month. Did they have an audience? - And how! You couldn't get tickets. The famous "Turquoise Ensemble". Give me the case. Get me the kamancheh. We're driving to Margaret. lt's nice. Enough already! You're giving me a headache. Here, eat something. You played nicely. - Thanks. Why not play some more? Come back some other time. Finish up, and leave some for Nahum. Great musician, shitty character. Who played before? - The one with the mustache. Amram... Take it. lt's your dad's. He can't play it anymore. Then play it yourself. l don't play this type of instruments. What did you do yesterday? Yesterday? l played it for fun. - So just play it for fun. How much did you collect? Not much. What is this? - Yehezkel, it was a slow day. That's all l got. Come on. The day is out and we didn't make a penny. Who's Margaret? A good friend. She was the singer in "Turquoise Ensemble". That's right. What do we have to do by her? l have to talk with her about something. What style of music do you play? l play rock-n'-roll, blues... l play my own material, but not on acoustic instruments. Playing an acoustic instrument connects you to your soul. You sound like my dad. While the other kids were playing outside, l had to play the kamancheh. l hated it so much. Your father is a great musician. l bet he taught you a thing or two. Yes, but you guys are from another generation. You're old-school. Today everything is electric. What are you doing here? Hello, Yechiel. - You didn't keep your promise. l'm sorry, l didn't... l didn't mean to come back. - What do you want? l need to talk to Margaret. - Yechiel, who is it? Nobody. Yosef? Hello, Margaret. Come on in. This is Amram. Mufradi's son. Mufradi's son? Welcome. Have a seat. What would you like to drink? Some tea? lf it's no trouble... Yechiel, make some herbal tea, please. Do you still sculpt? Not anymore. - Did you sculpt that? You like it? There are many more in the garden, you can go look. Yosef, why did you come here? Mufradi is at the end of the road. He caught it in his lungs. He sent this. You play really well. Who are you? l'm Amram. What are you doing here? l'm here with someone who came to see Margaret. Mind if l sit down? No. lt's really pretty. ls it an Egyptian Oud? No. lt's a Persian Oud. Thanks. l've never seen an Oud like this. lt was actually made for my mom. lt's smaller. "The Ballad of the Weeping Spring" What do l do with this, Margaret? You have to keep your promise, Yosef. Many years have passed. We were kids back then. Mufradi would do it for you. l'm sorry. l'm sorry for everything. That's Tamara. Tamara? She sings well. Why did you come here? Yechiel, calm down. - To stir things up? Yechi... l apologize. She's not going with him. lf she isn't going then l am. - You can't. You leave me no choice. - How can you say that? After all he's done to you?! Mufradi wants us to honor the deal. l'm doing this for my friends. Yosef is just as obligated as l am. So don't be mad at him. Help him. He's punished himself enough. Let Tamara go. She needs this, Yechiel. You have a beautiful voice. Thanks. Say, do you know any "Turquoise Ensemble" tunes? My dad was a member. Your dad? What's his name? Avram. Avram Mufradi. Avram Mufradi is your dad?! You know how much l've heard about him from my mom? ls he here? No, l came here with Yosef Tawilla. Yosef Tawilla? Tamara knows who you are. She heard many stories about you as a child. Yosef, take Tamara with you. You won't find anyone as good. She doesn't even know me. Yosef... Perhaps it's time. l have to have a word with Yechiel. Yechiel? l didn't want to come here. But l had no choice. l couldn't say no to a dying man. l need your help. l took care of this family while you were in jail. This is your family, Yechiel. l'm out of the picture. What do you need? l need Tamara. Alright. And l need a few more good musicians, maybe you can help me. What you're looking for is very hard to find. That generation is slowly dying out. There's an Oud player in Birdtown. David Farid. They say he's the best in the area. David Farid? -He has Farid El Atrash tattooed on his arm. That's his trademark. Thank you, Yechiel. Thank you. We have to go. Hello. l'm Tamara. l'm Yosef. Yosef, Yosef Tawilla. - l know who you are. l love your music. l liked your singing. You have a nice voice. - Thank you. Are you playing again? No, not yet. Amram, send my love to your father. Thank you very much, l will. Good luck. Tamara, my life... Go. And have no fear. You can do this. l'll see you soon. Good luck. - Thank you. Tamara... Here, read it. That's the song. You mind telling me what's going on? We're going to play this piece for your father. "Oud, Violin, Flute... "kamanche, Cello"? l can play this entire ensemble on a Synthesizer. We're arranging an acoustic ensemble. There's not enough time. He's dying. Your father and l wrote this piece and it was never played. But if we don't get there in time, there'll be no one to play it to. lt was written for these instruments and that's how it'll be played. Where will you find these musicians? l'll look around. Where? ln Birdtown there's an Oud player named David Farid. You know him? - No. We're looking for a man with a Farid El Atrash tattoo on his arm. Good evening. He doesn't see very well, he doesn't talk very much, but there's no one else like him. Please welcome Haim "The Bat"! Hey there. Still making a living? Yes, thank God. Excuse me. You there... Are you David Farid? What do you want? l need you. "Turquoise Ensemble". lt's my birthday. - Congratulations. Yosef Tawilla. Can we talk? - My pleasure. Listen, l want you to come and perform with us. We have a concert in Givat Hillel. lt's only for two days. Two days? - Two days. No problem. l'll come with you. l can play any instrument you like. But first thing's first: A bottle of Arak. Then we'll cut a deal. Arak? You're already drunk like a fish. Don't worry. Go get it. Stay with him, l'll be right back. Go. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. Go, collect the money. Hello, sir. What can l get you? - A glass. He's a totally wasted. What do we do with him? l want to talk with the guy on stage. l have to call home. ls there a phone here? Yes, in the corner. Tell your uncle Eliyahu to prepare what is needed. To prepare what? - He knows. Move it! Hello. l'm Yosef Tawilla. l know you. l knew that you were familiar. "Turquoise Ensemble". May l sit down? lt would be an honor to have a great musician as yourself join us. Thank you. l liked how you played. l've been waiting a long time to play with them. lt's an honor for us to play with you. How about you? l don't drink. But here's to music. Cheers! Can l buy you a glass of Arak? Arak? Yes. Excuse me? - Yes? Could l have two glasses of Arak? Sure. - Thanks. Thanks. Cheers, Amram. Cheers. You're crazy. Doesn't it burn? l like the taste. What taste? lt's hard Liquor. So what? That was great, what you just did. Where did you learn to do that? By myself. Can you do other sounds? How can l help you? - l need a few musicians. lt's not a money issue, it's just that l have a family, l can't leave them. lt's only for two days. l have obligations. Sorry. lt's okay. l understand. Good luck. Good luck, everyone. Take care. You too. Listen. We have a band. We thought... perhaps you'd like to join us. We could do a great show, featuring your imitations. Really? - Make a load of money. Come with us to the "Four Winds" inn. l can't, l'm going with Yosef Tawilla. Don't you have anything better to do? - You know him? l've heard about him. He killed two of his friends. You're kidding. Not at all. Let's take him. Wait, my Arak! Get up. He'll give it to you. Don't worry. lt'll be alright. Where are you taking him? We're taking him home. Leave him here, l'll take him home. The things he can do with his mouth... Do you have a handkerchief? lf he hadn't shown up, we could have taken him. Had you kept out of this,. we could have taken him. Good night. - Good night. Excuse me. What happened to him? He got hit on the head. He's bleeding. Come with me. Thanks. You can seat him here. Easy now... easy. Are you his relative? No, he has no one. Sit down. We'll bring out some food. What happened? - He was hit in the head. lt's a good thing they brought him in.

Avram Mufradi. The show is for Avram Mufradi? - Yes. This is his son Amram. Nice to meet you. l'm sorry to hear about your father. He's a great musician. l didn't know it's for Mufradi. l thought it was a gig, to make money. lt's okay. l'll have a word with my wife. Go sit in the kitchen, l'll make you something to eat. Stay here for the night. - No, we don't want to impose. You're not imposing. Make yourselves at home. Thank you. Let's sit down. l keep telling him not to drink. l have to leave for two days. You said you wouldn't leave the house. We're going to play for that guy's dad. He's on his deathbed. Who's his father? - Avram Mufradi. From "Turquoise Ensemble"? You want to start drinking again? l promise l won't drink. How many years ago did you stop playing? Many. Many years ago. Does your mom still sing? Yes, when she's in the mood. You know, there were times when she sang... l'd get all teary-eyed. l understand you. What did your mom teach you? Everything. To play instruments, to read music, gave me voice lessons, taught me proper diction. She taught me everything. ls there anything special that your mom taught you? She taught me the secrets of the trill. You know the secrets of the trill, Tamara? -Yes. She never hit a wrong note. Here, eat up. Thanks. Give Daddy a kiss. Give me a kiss. Hold her hand. Be careful. l'll go prepare your bag. - Yes. Pack up my favorite suit. Good morning. - Morning. What instruments are we talking about? l need a Ney-flute. You know any Ney-flutists? There's Haim "The Bat", he has his own unique sound, but it will be a problem to get him there. ls that the shitty character? - He's not a shitty character, he's cool. l don't want to work with people like him. Whatever you say. What about Mufradi's son? Amram? Amram inherited his father's talent, but... l don't think he's interested. What about the drummers, Yoel and Shaul? They're the best. Yes, l want them on board. Good morning. Good morning. Did you put in salt? No, it's sugar. - No, it's salt. That's all they had. This is sugar. - This is mine. This used to be yours. - No, it's mine. We also need a cellist. Anyone in mind? Cello? Yes. There's one guy, "Bad-Luck" Shimon. A great musician. He lives in kefar Mashkimim. We can pick him up. You know him well? We used to do music together. Can l trust him? - He's a good guy. Sometimes he gets into trouble doing stupid things. What kind of stupid things? Nothing on purpose. He's always caught. But if we watch out for him, it'll be worth it. What's going on? There's someone in that house. See those people there? They're waiting for him to come out. What did he do? He ran away in the middle of their wedding. What tune are they playing? - The Vengeance tune. She has to make him bleed. Make him bleed? Why? He humiliated her. Where does "Bad Luck" Shimon live? He's the one hiding. He's the groom. He's the groom? - Yes. Perhaps we can make some sort of deal with them. What deal? Look at the knife she's holding. Yosef, what are you doing here? l need the man... who's in the house. That bastard? He left our sister Rivka in the middle of the wedding. Who's this? This is Yosef Tawilla. We know each other since we were bouncers at the clubs. Those were good times. Right, Yosef? Nice to meet you. l'm sorry, but l can't let him go. He humiliated me in front of everybody. May l have a moment? Look, l need him to... play for a friend. lt's his dying wish. Who's that? Mufradi. Avram Mufradi? Yes. - What happened to him? He caught the disease. Can you talk to her? He disrespected her. She won't let him get away with. Yosef, let's get them married. Then we'll take care of his needs. He has no choice. She's going to cut him up. Can l talk to him? Go ahead, Yosef. Get us out of this mess. Let's try to go in there and talk to him. Shimon! Shimon! Who's there? - David. David Farid. Open up. David?! What are you doing here? l need you. open up. Who's there with you? - Friends. Open up, we can solve your problem. Are you sure? - 100%. Everything's okay, calm down. They're out of their mind. They're playing the Vengeance tune. l'm Yosef. Yosef Tawilla. You're from "Turquoise Ensemble", aren't you? -That's right. What are you doing here? Have a sit. You ran away in the middle of the wedding? They drove me nuts, David. Don't you like her? l saw her face. She's not so bad. lt's not her, it's her brothers. What's wrong about her brothers? They're good guys, l know them. Right. With this family behind you, you'll be untouchable. Don't give up on that so quickly. -That's true. lt's better to be with them than against them. Besides, you don't leave a loving woman. She won't let me play music. - Why not? Her brothers want me to leave music and come work for them. l have no time to hit people. My whole day is... My whole life is about music, l don't have the time. We'll take care of that. Yosef will talk with them. Does anything else bother you? She... smothers me. What do you mean? When she kisses me she slips her tongue down my throat until l choke. We'll take care of that. Don't worry. Go get the Cello, some clothes, and let's go play music. Look, if you want him, you must promise two things: One: let him play. lt's his whole life, it's in his blood, Ovadya. Okay. He can play all he wants. What's the second thing? The second thing is that you have to tell your sister to give shorter kisses. l don't know if it will help. Shimon! You know she loves you, right? - Yes, and l love her. l do, sweetie. l also love you guys. You're great brothers-in-law. So come kiss the bride. You really are nice brothers-in-law. l really love you. What are you scared of? Come here. Come here. Congratulations! Rivka... Rivka, let him breathe. He's going to faint. Enough! - Rivka, stop! l'm mad about him! l need some water. Water. Yosef... - Water... You did a good deed. Come take him from Givat Hillel in two days, okay? Come, let's go. Congratulations. Congratulations! Congratulations! You're responsible for him coming back, right? Don't worry. He'll be under surveillance. They put my house under siege. l had no food and was getting hungry. They played the Vengeance tune for three days! Why didn't you climb out the window? Did you see my brothers-in-law? Each has a head this big. This big, Shaul. Where are you planning to do the concert? There's this cave... A cave? Yes. The one with the tombs? You know it? My dad used to take me there when l was a kid. Who's buried there? Two of our friends. That's where you'll do the concert? The concert and the burial will be there. You're going to bury my dad in a cave? That's what he wants. Give me an elegant look, comb it from on top. Elegant. Make it look... - lt's all frizzy. What's with you guys and this cave? We used to love playing in it. That's where we wrote "The Weeping Springtime Ballad". Okay, but why be buried there? We were innocent. We all swore we'd be buried there. Whichever band member dies - the rest will play the song. lt was sort of our will. You're all crazy. l know. But nobody thought your father would actually want to do it. Vivo? -Hey, "Bad luck". - What are you doing here? We're having a bonfire. - Are coming to play? Not now, maybe later. You've been here before. l used to play here back when your father of blessed memory was still alive. ln the good old days. - Yes, things were different. Tell me, which one here is the best violinist? Darwish. But he doesn't do ensembles. Doesn't do ensembles... What about the others? Not as good as him. - Bruria, give me a beer. That's a nice tattoo. Who's the tattoo artist? A friend of mine. Look. They did a nice job. You can join us, if you like. - Thanks, but l'm here with friends. Fine. You have many imposters. Hey, Bruria. - Hey, Shimon. How are you? Sorry, Bruria, l'm married. Congratulations. Get me a bottle of Arak and five glasses. Who's the fifth glass for? Tamara asked for one. Take one glass out. l don't want her to drink. Do you like? No. No? No. What are you going to do about it? l'll tear you apart. Arak, at last. What about me? Here. No, Tawilla said no. Sorry, l didn't know. What business is it of his? - l don't know... Cheers! - Cheers. To my brothers-in-law's heads getting even bigger! Good evening. Sorry for interrupting. You're not. That's a pretty violin. Thanks, l don't drink. Cheers. Who built it for you? lt's from the Gambari family. Why do you ask? We need a violinist for a concert we're doing. l heard you're the best. l don't play in ensembles. What's the problem? - There isn't a problem. ls it final? Sorry. What are you hyped up about? You're making trouble. What trouble? Amram... Don't let her drink. Don't worry, she doesn't get drunk. What do you mean? l don't know much about it, but... lt doesn't go to her head. lt doesn't? That's what she says. Sit here and don't move. l'm going to the bathroom. What did he say? That he's not interested. He doesn't play in ensembles. A solo artist, huh? - Probably. l didn't know "The Bat" can play. l told you he's great. l thought it was the other guy. - What other guy? "Goliath". He doesn't play any instrument. lt's a good flute. lt was my late grandfather's. Take it. - l couldn't. Take it, l'm giving it to you. A musician like yourself deserves the best instrument. This is yours. When you play it, my soul reaches the sky. Come, we have to go. l told you to play only when l tell you to, didn't l? Where are you taking him? What do you want from him? What do l want from him? We have some unfinished business. Such as? - He owes me money. He works for me until his debt is paid off. Do you owe him money? - No. -You bastard! You can impress them, not me. l know exactly who you are. We'll talk. Let's go. - You're going. He stays here. You're with us, Haim. Thanks for your help, Darwish. ls he with you guys? - Looks like it. Look, l can come with you, but you'll have to talk to my people first. Who do l talk to? Yakov "The Shark". Yakov "The Shark"? Who's that? He's the boss. -ls he far from here? - No, he lives close by. Where? - Wheat's Gates. We'll take care of it. Here. Drink it. l don't drink. l saw you drink before. - lt was make-believe. And it never goes to my head anyway. Do you drink a lot? l can hold my liquor. You don't have to worry. l'm responsible for you. lt's a little late for that, isn't it? l'm sorry about that. lt's okay. l have a father. Yechiel is my father. l'm not mad at you. There are things l want to know. Such as? How come you never came to visit me? Weren't you curious to know who l was? Who l'd grown up to be? You have to understand. l was a dead man walking and someone had to take care of you and your mom. And Yechiel was willing to do so. lt was the best thing for you. So you punished me? l punished myself. l killed two of my friends. l put your mother in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. Were you the driver? Yes. Were you drunk? l don't get drunk. lt was a dark night. We were driving back from a concert. Everyone was tired, they fell asleep. l closed my eyes for a moment and when l opened them l found myself rolling down into a ravine. l killed everyone's dreams. For those who died and those who stayed alive. And l'm sorry it ended this way. My heart goes out To my darling Do my eyes send love The springtime will come now I will embrace those who love it And who waited all year Yearning Is flooding the world and life Yearning Keeps the world together And the days Yearning Is flooding the world and life Yearning Keeps the world together And the days Keeps life together. My eyes send regards Only to him My eyes send love The springtime will come now It will wash away the winter clouds In the middle of the year Yearning Is flooding the world and life Yearning... What were you doing with him? He gave my mother some money. Told her he was giving me a job. lt's been like this for three years now. Why didn't you leave him? He claims l still owe him a quarter of the loan. Still owe him a quarter of it... Yearning Is flooding the world and life Yearning Keeps the world together And the days... l looked everywhere. He's gone. Maybe it was too much for him. - l don't think so. People say they saw him go off with the flutist. The flulist? - Yes. What do you want to do? l must move on. Anybody with me? l can't force anybody. l'll leave a message with Bruria. We're coming. Let's go. - Okay, let's go. Bruria. Do you think he left because of me? l don't think so. l think it was all too much for him. lt's been weighing on me for years. l had to tell him. l think l hurt him. You spoke your feelings. Either way, he's your father. My father... l know him only from photographs. Good evening. - A great evening. Tell me, isn't there anything more interesting than this old thing? That's what l have at the bar. lf you need anything... No problem. - Thanks. ls something wrong? No. Nothing's wrong. Have you seen the folks l came here with?

Upon my soul comes the darkness of winter Like a bell The narrow bridge Between yesterday and tomorrow The evening glides and floats. My home is not far You are also going away I willpaint my yearning to you For I have no strength to speak We willmeet In our beloved country For you are a foreigner In a grieving country. The sound of your torn string I will yearn for its distant sound The night is bright with craziness The smell of spring like a planted tree My home is not far You are also going away. I willpaint my yearning to you For I have no strength to speak. We willmeet In our beloved country For you are a foreigner In a grieving country. English: Hagit Harel Subtitles: Cinematyp Studios Ltd.
