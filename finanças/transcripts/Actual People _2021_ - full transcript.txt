So are we going to Manhattan tonight? OK, so, there's this cute guy I met on a shoot who I'm kind of trying to fuck... He is either fucking dumb as hell or he fucking blew his brains out on acid. Either way it does not matter because he invited me to a party in Bed Stuy tonight and we're going. Last time we went to one of your fancy fashion parties - I got my fake taken. - Well, they're not going to card, so… That's what you said last time! Besides, I told you Fred's here for that art opening tonight. I thought that was a joke. Wait, what are you talking about? So there's this really cute guy in my life drawing class and he's going to this gallery's opening tonight. A bunch of people from his studio are going and he was like, "We should totally get together later." We should totally get together and fuck on the Chinatown bus back. Ew! I would never do that. I feel like you'd do it if he asked, like, maybe once. And really nicely. Fuck you! Well, I'm not going to Manhattan, anyway. Are you serious? - None of the trains are working. - Wait... I do know of one party. It's not going to be amazing but it is, like, a grad party. There will be alcohol. - Let's call Fred and go. - Okay. - Hey you! - Hey Anderson! Wait, come hang with us, please. - Anderson, let's party. - We wanna braid your hair. Guys, stop. He's thirty years old, like, get over it, bro. Whatever. He's being a baby. - He sucks. - Like I just wanna hang out. Stop it. Fucking stop it! He doesn't know that. So, is that them? Yeah. That one's Fred. He's the one with the glasses. - Hey. - What's up? - Michaela? - Oh, my bad. This is Fred. This is Gabby, Riley. We went to high school together. Hey what's up. We didn't want to go inside before you guys got here. Oh, yeah, that's cool. I don't know them either. Riley does. Yeah, they're just some random people from school. - Can I bum a cig? - Yeah for sure. - You want one? - No, I'm good. Riley doesn't smoke. Word. That's very commendable. I shouldn't smoke either. Smoking is bad for you. Yeah, obviously. - Wait, so you're from Philly too? - Yeah. I'm just going to school here, studying Philosophy. - That's cool. - She's also super smart. It's crazy. - It's crazy. - I'm really not, no. It's super cool you go to school here. I'm super jealous. It's cool, yeah. It's been a good experience so far. Can I have a sip of that? Do you have more? Okay, cool. Thank you. So are you also a sophomore? No, Riley's really old. Ugh, yeah. I'm about to graduate in like, a week, actually. - Holy shit. - Yeah. Are you scared? Absolutely terrified. So you're not from Philly? No. I'm from Lancaster? I know where it is. Riley and I went there and we dressed up in these like, colonial dresses and took pictures churning butter. It was hilarious. - Oh, yeah? - Are you Amish? Because I don't think you're allowed to have sex if you're Amish. Katie, stop it! I'm so sorry. I'm not Amish. Obviously. Have you ever seen an Amish Asian? - Asian Amish? - I don't know! Okay, I'm gonna get another beer. - Do you want anything? - No. I'm good. Okay. Katie? Yeah, okay. Yo. I came. - Oh yeah. What's up? - I just need to get in here. I just saw some friends of yours a second ago. Oh, yeah? Yeah. They're pretty funny. They showed me this dance you came up with in high school. Uh huh... Oh my God, stop. No. They're so ridiculous. So, who is that guy you're with? His name is Leo. He's from Philly. Are you, like, dating? Um, I don't know. I mean I just met him... But, he's really cool. Thanks. - Are you okay? - Mhmm... yeah. I just realized something. What? Everyone in movies dies the same way. They're like… But in real life they're just still. They just die. Do you want to, like...? Yeah, sure. I just... I could, like... use my tongue? I mean, I could use my mouth... like I could give you a blowjob. - Um, you don't have to... - No, no, no It's cool. I want to. Oh, I'm on the pill, so... Yeah, but... I just want to be safe, you know? Okay. So what are you going to do after? I don't know. I was going to move to Seattle but that isn't happening anymore. And I haven't thought of anything cooler to do. Why Seattle? My ex is from there and his parents are there and he wanted to be close to them. How long were you guys together? Since freshman year... so like, more than three years. That's so unimaginable to me. What? How long we were together for? Yeah. I had a boyfriend for most of high school too, so. I guess I'm very relationship-y. I don't know, that sounds so intense to me. Yeah I don't know. It's better than what I'm doing now... which is... like, not much of anything. What happened to you guys? I cheated on him... with this, like, really hot male model... who... What? No. I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. No, the truth is that actually he cheated on me. He, like, left me. Is this weird to talk about? No. I mean, I don't care. Well, okay. I mean I can tell you what happened. So, we were in our senior year, first semester. And he took this finance class. I guess he wanted to do something practical because he was a Comparative Literature major. At the beginning it was just this weird inside joke we had, that he was turning into this alt-right frat guy. I don't know, he starts getting really into it. He's talking about the stocks and the Dow and he's going to these lectures and meetings and I don't know. It was so weird because I never saw him hanging out in this world. And then he started hanging out more and more with this one girl. And I don't know. Maybe in retrospect I felt uncomfortable but in the moment I don't remember feeling anything but fine. And then one day he's like, “Riley, I just..." "I don't..." You don't have to talk about it. No no no, the thing is I do. Because it's like this story that's still interesting to me because I can't quite make sense of it. But he said, "Riley, I met this other girl and I swear to you that nothing has happened yet but I think something will, and I think I need to pursue it." I mean what do you say to that? And that was it.. What an asshole. I mean, yeah, duh. But I don't even completely blame him. Because this girl is going to make so much fucking money. And she goes on runs and plants trees for the community and... I have nothing going on post-grad. I'm even getting kicked out of this fucking apartment. I don't know. Now I'm thinking I just need to get out of here. Maybe I'll be lame and move back to Philly. That would be cool. Yeah? It feels so sad to move back home though. You could get your own apartment. That's true. I guess I hadn't thought about that. I mean, it's no New York, but there's a lot of cool shit going on. Yeah, that's true. And my family's there... and Gabby and Michaela... and you. That's true. I'll be there. Sorry I had to dip early. I had to catch a bus back. No worries. When are you going to be back in NYC? Lol. I don't know. Probably not for a while. I've got mad work. Okay, do you see that? Yeah? That, like, V-shape her stomach is making? That's because she got her ribs removed. I mean… It's, like, what everyone's doing right now. I feel like she might just work out a lot. No, I'm telling you, it's physically impossible to have a body like that. Riley, do you know Tasha? Yeah, I met her once at a party. Oh my God, she's so pretty... Wei? Mama? Hi. Yeah. Okay, so... yeah. I have that yeast infection again. It just came back. Yeah, it's really bad. I don't know, because I'm stressed or something? I don't know. Yeah, I tried to get an appointment but they're really full. Can you write me a prescription for that cream, that steroid cream, again? No, I know, okay? Please, can you just do it? It's really bad. Yeah, for the pharmacy at the university hospital. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Alright. Bye. Hello! Hello! - Hi! - Sorry I'm late. What's up? Um... I somehow have the world's worst yeast infection? Yeah, I can smell it from here.. Fuck you! It's because you eat too much bread. Literally what? All that yeast. Okay, I know what you're thinking - and it's not the same kind of yeast. - Yes it is! There's a woman at MIT who is literally making yogurt with her vagina yeast. Okay, I read that same article and it's not the yeast, it's the cultures or whatever. Would you eat it? Vagina yogurt? I don't know. Maybe if you didn't tell me beforehand. What? I don't know actually... because it's just like the cultures, right? Like, how big are they? I think they're, like, really small. Like, they're pretty much unseeable. I saw David today. - Did you say anything? - No We just ignored each other. Or maybe I saw him and he didn't see me. - Are you okay? - Yeah! Yeah. I'm fine. It's, like, what you expect, right? Sorry. Someone's texting me. - What's up? - Hm? Who are you texting? Just this guy Tom Wachowski? He's in my Philosophy cohort. Do you know him? - Wachowski? - Yeah. He kind of wants to hang out if you're down. Depends. Where? Bed Stuy? - No. That's too far. - Okay. Yeah. You're right. You right. Well, I'm starting to get kind of hungry... What if we just met up in the middle? Why does everyone always say that? It's more inconvenient for both people. No, okay, you're right. So... where do you want to get food? I don't know. The bar he's at has food. Riley. Who even tries to fuck someone at the end of their last semester? That is like, beyond... - Desperate? - Desperate? Yeah. I don't know. I guess we're both just really bored or something. I don't know... Hey! So what you're saying is Asians shouldn't be considered for affirmative action? I mean, I guess I've been skirting around it a little bit... Skirting around it? I'm just saying that I think they've been afforded a lot of opportunities already... Opportunities? To do what? Be in internment camps and build railroads? Oh, don't bring up stuff that happened - like a hundred years ago to a tiny subset... - Don't bring up literal history and generational trauma? You know what I mean! No I don't. So why don't you tell me? - In our society... - Okay, so if an immigrant comes here and has to work super hard at like, a fast food restaurant and their kid has to learn English they should be denied the benefit of affirmative action? Like, they haven't already been given enough? That's such a niche example. It happens all the time! Yeah, but there are white people, poor white people, in literally the exact same - socioeconomic situation. - Everyone - always wants to bring up white people! - That have to work hard too to overcome... yeah because if you do it weakens your argument whereas if you don't it lacks inclusivity. White people are already included! Oh shit. You okay? Hey, do you want to go home? I can take her home. No, no, guys. It's, like, totally chill. I'm just going to use the bathroom really quick... if you want to scooch out. I'm just going to use the bathroom and I'll be right back. Seriously. Yeah. Hey. Where's Tom? - I told him to go home. - What, why? Because you need to go home. I need to go home. We need to go home. I still have to pay though. I already did. What? Katie! - I'll request you tomorrow. - Thank you! You are the best! I know. I know... - Hey! - Yo! - How's it going? - I'm, like, so fucking hungover. - How are you? - I finally finished. - Wait, what's today's date? - The fourth. Give me that. What did you write about? I wrote about the principle of bivalence, comparing it to... And you picked the hardest prompt. - Fuck you, man! - Hey! It's not the hardest prompt. It does have the most sources. Oh my God! What the fuck is wrong with me? - Seriously! I'm so screwed. - Hey! You've still got a few hours. Yeah, so? I have my intro and conclusion done. You've still got time! I heard you the first time! So...? Have you heard of this really cool thing called Adderall? Hey. Can you Venmo me when you get the chance?? Also I accidentally gave you a 25 milligram pill, so it might be a little strong. Just FYI. - Hey Riley. - Oh my God. Hi! - What's up? - How are you? - Good. How are you? - Fine. I was sort of hoping you'd come by. - Oh, yeah? - Do you have a minute to chat? Oh, yeah, sure. Do you want to go to my office? Oh, okay. Yeah. Have a seat wherever. Do you want water or anything? A gross Keurig coffee? - No, I'm good, thanks. - Are you sure? - It's no trouble. - No, I'm really good. Thanks. I don't know why it's still so hot in here all the time, it makes me feel like I'm having heat flashes twenty-four-seven. - That sucks. - Yeah... OK... well... so I just... this is sort of difficult to talk about. But, I'm a little worried. I just read your last paper, and because it was late, and because of the quality, I had to give you a failing grade. Oh. I guess I didn't think my argument was amazing, but- Well, I have to be honest, it seemed like you used more of the Sparknotes instead of finding the actual nuances of the essays. - Oh, I read the essays. - Okay. I definitely wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. I believe you. And I know, I know you've had a tough semester. But, at the moment, you're barely passing. I'm worried. What will happen if I don't pass? You'll have to repeat the course for credit over the summer, which I teach at the Brooklyn campus. - Can I still walk? - Excuse me? Like, will I be able to walk at graduation? My parents are going to be really upset if I can't do that. I think that's something to discuss with your academic advisor. But what I'm more concerned about is the fact that you don't seem passionate about this material. I remember you as a freshman. You were so vibrant and talkative and... I just would hate to see this stupid adult stuff beat you down. I'm not beaten down. Right, of course, that was a poor choice of words. - What I mean is... - Sorry. I just turned in my essay, right? And I think it's pretty good. I mean, maybe not great. But I think it's good enough to pass. Okay. I look forward to reading it, then. So, to change the subject... What's post-grad looking like? - Oh, ha. - What? I don't know. I guess just the way you were talking about it made it seem, like, this exciting prospect. Well, did you apply to any of the fellowships or the post-grad programs I put on the listserv? Remember we were talking about you applying to that fellowship in Denver? Yeah... I was going to apply... but then... short answer for all of that: I didn't. I was going to apply. But I did not. There's always next year. Yeah, totally... So I actually have a seminar starting, like, right now. So I have to get going. I'm sorry. I'm just in a rush. Can we continue this discussion some time, Riley? When you have more time? Yeah, yeah. For sure. Thank you for letting me know. I'll see you in class. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. I loved that painting you posted. It's super cool. Sorry, I just saw this. Thanks. It turned out super cool. Yeah. It's awesome. How are you doing? So we don't handle graduation tickets, that's this guy Marty Doyer. D as in dog, O, Y, E, R. Yeah, exactly. So you need to email him about getting more tickets. His e-mail is m.doyer... not a problem. You as well. Bye bye! - "Bye bye!" - You're so dumb. I am so bored. Same. I will do any job after I graduate as long as it doesn't involve looking at Gmail for the entire day. That's any job we're ever going to get. Do you wanna get boba after work? I mean, sure. Since when do you like boba? I don't really know if I do. But I see every other Asian person on campus drinking it and I feel excluded. It's really bad for you. How is that even possible? I had a dentist who was Chinese and he could literally tell when one of his patients had too much bubble tea because it would literally, like, rip out their molars. That sticky stuff. - What, the tapioca? - Yeah. Maybe not then. I just remembered. My brother and I used to call him "Doctor Wonton." What? My brother and I used to call that dentist Doctor Wonton. I was trying to remember his real name and I couldn't... Why do you think you called him that? I dunno... I guess 'cause he was Chinese. - Hey. - Hey. I didn't know you were home today. Yeah... My boss is letting me edit from here. Our side of the office is getting a new coat of paint today. Hell yeah for telecommuting. Oh, yeah. Are you still working on that thing about the cult in Bushwick? No, we just got picture lock on that. We're moving onto the future of weed lubes. - Nice. - Yeah. Hey, I think we should talk. Yeah? What's up? I've been trying to think about the right way to bring this up, but... Yeah. What's going on? I just need to come out and say it. Okay, so say it. Okay. I'd appreciate it if you weren't just around in your underwear anymore. Wait, what? I know we said that nothing should change after we... you know... - Had sex? - Yeah. - Yeah?! - But... I guess it's kind of confusing for me now because I... I don't know. It's just confusing. It feels like maybe you want to have something happen again. What about me, like, slumped over after not showering, equals I'm trying to fuck you again? Not necessarily- Like, I didn't even know you were home today, right? Yeah. I'm not talking about right now. It's other times. - What other times? - Like, all the time! Like when you're going to the bathroom... Okay, why are you looking at me like that then? I don't want to make this a big deal. I was just thinking to myself... what if I brought a girl over and she sees you all around the apartment in your underwear. It's not the most ideal image. What girl? A hypothetical girl. A woman. Sure. Think about it. She just sees you, like, laying around in your underwear and you're all cool and casual about it like, "Hey, I'm Riley. I'm Anderson's roommate!" She'd probably be like, "Who's that girl?” You know? Yeah. I guess. Is that cool? Yeah sure. So, you want me to put pants on, like, this instant? That would be preferable. Excuse me. You must, like, really think a lot about yourself. Excuse me? You think that because we had sex one time that I'm now in love with you and everything I do is an attempt to like, woo you I don't think that. You obviously think you're hot shit if you see me in my two-year-old sagging granny panties that my grandpa literally sent me from China and you're like, "Wow, Riley is so horny for me." I literally didn't say any of that. But that's what you're implying! You're really blowing this out of proportion. No. I'm not! God! I knew you wanted to sleep with me before David and I even broke up and I was just like, doing some fucked up wish fulfillment for you and now you're, like, actually delusional. - Actually delusional. - You're really... That's really... You're such a... Such a what? This is your last month! - Wait, what? - You heard me. You gotta move out. I... I can't live with you anymore. You're such a... millennial! You're kicking me out because I'm a millennial? No. I'm kicking you out because of your energy and your constant partying and thinking nothing, like, has any consequences. You treat everything as if it's disposable. You make me feel disposable. No, I mean, I obviously don't think you're disposable. I'm sorry. - I just said that out of anger. - Yeah. But that's the problem. You just lashed out at me. And honestly, like, I let you live here because of David, and his brother and I don't work together anymore and you two aren't even friends so... I don't have any loyalty to you. Okay. Fine. Look, I'm sorry it had to be like this... but... - But what?! - I don't know. I don't know how to finish that sentence. I just started it because it sounds like something people say. I'm going to go put some pants on. Fuck! Shit! - Oh my God. - Sorry. No, no, you're cool. You just spooked the fuck out of me. That was supposed to be a little smoother. No, I'm good. I'm just, like, skittish. Hey, what's up? Hi. I haven't seen you in forever. What are you listening to? No, don't! Stop! It's so embarrassing. That's so degrading. Well, don't listen to it if it offends you! It should offend you. I guess I don't mind being offended. - Do you want one? - Nah, I'm good. I always forget that. You don't smoke. What are you doing out here then? You shouldn't have to smoke to take a break outside. You have any big summer plans after graduation? You going anywhere? No, I'm just moving. So, packing, etc. - Moving sucks. - Yeah. My roommate like, freaked out because I didn't become obsessed with him after we had sex one time and he was like, “Get out. I can't take your energy.” - Damn! - I know. What are you going to do? I don't know... squat at Katie's parents's place on the Upper West Side? Or move to Philly for a bit. I don't fucking know. Didn't someone tell me you were going to Seattle? Yeah... that was when David and I were still together - because his parents are from there so... - Shit. - My bad. - What? It's fine. Don't worry about it. No, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up. No, seriously. It's no big deal. I don't care at all. - Sorry. - Stop apologizing. - Sorry, I mean... - I'm still going to move though. - Yeah? - Yeah. Because if I don't I'm just standing around waiting for real life to begin. This isn't real life? I hope it's not. Anyways, I'm going to go finish my paper. But I'll text you. - Let's get coffee or something? - Yeah, for sure - Okay. Bye. - See you. I guess it just feels like every person I talk to is like, "Oh, I'm going to grad school post-grad" Or, like, "I'm going to work at this online magazine Or this start-up" and I'm just doing absolutely nothing. Do you have any goals post-grad? I know you're feeling overwhelmed But sometimes it's been helpful for people graduating to look a few years out instead of the immediate future, but a few years out. - How old are you? - I'm twenty-two. Okay, so maybe we could think about when you're 25. Do you see yourself in grad school, or maybe traveling? Traveling could be cool, maybe. Yeah. Okay. What about your interpersonal relationships? Do you see yourself fostering new friendships, or maybe getting closer to your family since you've been away for such a long time? I mean, all that sounds good to me... Okay. So I know we've talked about your relationships, how you're always in really long relationships. Do you think that's something you want again, that type of stability and support? Maybe... Is that something I can, like, ask the universe for though? I don't know about the universe. But if you want to, you can ask it for yourself. If you think you deserve it then sure, make it a goal. Okay. Are you still interested in that boy you met? Leo? Yeah, I am I don't really know what he thinks of me, though. We talk and then... I don't know. It's like, I'm here, you know? - What is it about him? - Hm? What is it about him that makes him different? You've had a lot of different experiences and partners over the year. But nobody has seemed to have made the same type of impression as he has. Do you have any feelings as to why? I don't know if this is weird to say, but I think it's because he's also half-Asian. I've never been with anyone who was half-Asian before and I guess there's just this sense of belonging. Like, I feel like I go through a lot of weird bullshit because I'm half. And it's nice being with someone who I assume shares those same feelings and experiences. That's actually really great. And it makes a lot of sense. Alright. Well, our time is up. So, it's been really great working with you. And good luck with graduation. Wait, what? This is your eighth session. Wait, I thought I had one left. Hm. Let me check. So you can see here you've had all eight of your allotted sessions. Oh. Okay. I'm sorry. I know, it goes so fast but you really have come far. I really don't feel like that at all. Can I just like, text or call you maybe once or twice before graduation? Just for a few minutes to check in? Unfortunately, Riley, that's not allowed. Is there a ten, fifteen-minute time block I could take? Like, at any time. I'll take it. Unfortunately, all the slots have been filled. We have a lot of people to see. Yeah, I know. It's just that you've gotten to know me and my situation really well and... And I've really enjoyed that. A lot of my friends text their therapists. But I'm not your therapist anymore. Hey. I just thought I'd call you because you said that you were going to be free around now. So I just thought I'd call. I'm just going to be home working on stuff. Um, yeah. I found your chain as well when I was cleaning my room so if you were wondering where that was, it's here. I have it. Okay, cool. Give me a call back. Bye. - Hey. - Hey. Did you go out tonight? Yeah. I just went to this bar, like, down the way. I don't think it's lame to go to a bar by yourself. Do you? No. I failed. What? My final paper. It sucked. I have to take a summer class. Oh. Shit. Yeah. Shiiiiiit. I don't know how I'm going to tell my parents. You'll figure it out. They're nice. I mean, they seemed nice when you moved in. I'm going to ask you something. Shoot. Why do guys, like, ignore girls after they sleep with them? Maybe because they realize they're not what they're looking for? I don't know. But what if they are? How would you know that? Because, they had a mutual connection. Like, they had a mutually good time. Yeah. Or he's just a dick who just manipulates girls into thinking he's nice when he really just wants to fuck. Were you ever like that? Probably more so in college. But that seems a little heartless now, don't you think? I don't think he's heartless. I think something else is going on. The answer is probably simpler than you realize. That he's... madly in love with me and everything he's doing is to hide the intensity of his emotions? Yeah. For sure. That's it. I'm like, really sorry about the way I treated you, Anderson. That really wasn't right of me. It's cool. No, it's not. You were like, such an amazing... Seriously, you were the best roommate I've ever had. Well, thank you. You're welcome. Stop, come on. No, Riley. This is fucked up. Alright? You're leaving at the end of the month. Like, that is final. And I already found another roommate so... I don't know. Go figure your shit out. Good night. And drink some fucking water. Yeah. Hey. I just wanted to let you know I found like, the most perfect apartment in Philly. - Cute! - Yeah, it's on Passyunk. It's right by that place we used - to do karaoke every Wednesday. - So cute! Wait. Come back this weekend for a party. Yeah. That sounds cool. And you know, Leo is definitely supposed to be there. Yeah. I'm totally down. Okay, cool. I'm pregaming before with these girls from my class but they're really cool - if you want to come. - Yeah. - Can you text me the details? - Yeah. I'll talk to you later. - You good? - I'm just about to go on the subway. - Okay. Bye. - Bye! Ah, fuck! I thought that was you. It's the hair. I thought you didn't have class on this campus anymore. I don't. I was here visiting an old professor. How's everything going? Fine. I guess. I saw that same guy on the Q train. The one we saw drop the baby. He was with his wife on the train with the baby and I think he recognized me and I was just staring at him and I couldn't stop laughing. It was really funny. Did the baby look okay? Mm, his head was definitely a little squashed looking... but still cute. Oh my God. I heard you're moving out of Anderson's. Yeah. We slept together. I heard. What was your reaction? I don't know. It was kind of weird to hear. But, I always sensed a vibe with you guys, so, you know, I wasn't shocked. There wasn't a vibe. Okay. It just happened. Okay. Listen, I wanted to tell you that I'm not going to be moving to Seattle anymore. What, why? Jess got a job here. Jess? Jessica. Yeah. She got a job in the city so we're going to be staying in the city. Why does this concern me? I don't know. I thought it'd be kind of weird if we bumped into each other on the street and you'd thought that I'd moved and I hadn't moved. And I just thought I should let you know. Well, I'm not staying here, so... Where are you moving? I'm going back to Philly. I'm, like, getting my own apartment. - That's cool. - Yeah. I'm kind of seeing this guy there. He doesn't want to do the distance anymore. Well, that will be good for you guys to be closer together. That will be nice. So as usual you're making a really big deal out of nothing. I mean, if you feel that way... Like, are you trying to rub it in my face? No, Riley. I would never do that. I swear. That's not what this is. Then what are you doing? I don't know. I still care about you. I still feel love for you. - I just wanted to be honest with you. - Don't say that. Say what? That hippy-dippy bullshit. Don't say you feel love for me. That's like some weird fucked-up consolation prize. Because you have it in your head that if you loved me you wouldn't have cheated and since you only feel love for me you're still a good person. Riley, we've talked about this a million times. I swear, nothing happened when you and I were together with Jessica. Whatever! Emotional cheating! All those nights when you were, like, late to come home or you wouldn't text me till morning and you were always like, “Jessica and I went on a run,” and “Jessica and I did this,” and “Jessica says I should eat more fermented foods” and oh my God! Fuck you! Seriously! I can't believe I am out here yet again letting you waste my time! And honestly, even if we did see each other in the city I'd probably walk right past you and say to whoever I was with: "There's the asshole that cheated on me and the stupid bitch he's with now." Okay. Please don't talk about her like that. - It's got nothing to do with her. - Okay! Listen, I just think if we kept talking we could be friends. And I do miss your friendship. I miss you as a person. I don't. I don't miss your constant whining and complaining and talking about how smelly the city is and how you like, literally root through my garbage to find the recycling like some fucking weird psychopath, - like who even fucking does that? - So sue me for thinking recycling's important. - Fuck you. - What are you doing? Riley! Stop it! Oh my God, are you okay? Do you need me to call somebody? - Call somebody? She's... - Am I talking to you? Seriously, I can walk you somewhere. I can get you a cab Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah. No we're... We're really good. I'm sorry. I'm good. Thank you. - Okay. - Seriously, thank you. Riley, what the fuck was that? I can't believe... she thought... I, like, needed back up! Hey. Are you going to that party in center? I was thinking about it. Why? What's up? I think I'll be there. We should meet up. Actually, yeah, I'll definitely be there. When do you think you'll be there? Hi! Hi! I'm glad you came. - This is fucking crazy! - I know, right? - Come on. Let's go. - Okay! Sorry, excuse me. - Where are we? - I don't know. - So I saw that Fred was here. - Yeah. How is everything? It's good. Really good. Yeah. You guys have…? Damn, how was it? It was very sexy. Shit. Fred? - Yeah. It was hot. - Damn! - Oh my God. - Yeah. Wait, is Leo here? Yeah, I think so. He's probably looking for you. - Yeah, maybe. - You should go find him. Oh, hey, what's up... Hey, what's up? Were you just watching me? What? No! What? I'm fucking with you. What's up? Oh. Hah. I just wanted to know where Leo went? Yeah, it was really crowded inside so we went to this pop-up shop. A pop-up shop? Yeah, they don't really card so we go there a lot. Just search "Kamihira." Sorry, sorry. Oh my God, Riley? Oh my God! Hey, Juliet. What's up? Aren't you supposed to be in New York? - Yeah, I am... - I haven't seen you since, like, high school. That's crazy. Is your life, like, a TV show now? Because I saw this picture of you at this party or something, and I was just like, oh my God, I knew that Riley was this cool, different, kind of quirky girl but you looked like a fucking celebrity. Like on that roof? Was that in Brooklyn? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. And I've just been, like, chugging away at Penn. I'm a Comcast intern. And I'm also head of my sorority, which I know is so like... I never thought I'd be the head bi-atch you know- Yeah, no, totally. Do you know this guy named Leo? Leo? Sophomore in studio art? Yeah. Do you know my brother, Peter? He's friends with him. They film skate videos together on this little camera they got from the thrift store! Which is so adorable. Why? We're kind of hooking up. No way. Are you serious? He is really cute. That's exciting. He's cute! Oh my God. So I'm going to go find him. Wait, tell me really quick: What are you doing after grad? I'm not doing much of anything. I'm just sort of having a mental breakdown. Same. Don't you love how now you can just be having a mental breakdown? Yeah. Totally. Okay, well, I'll see you later. Alright, well, take a shot with me later, okay? - Okay, I will. - Bye! Oh, shit! - Hey. - Whoa. Hey. What's up? I've been good, chilling, working in the studio every day on this painting. - Cool. - Yeah, it's been a time. - I'd love to see it when it's done... - Pussy! Yo, chill! What were you saying? No, yeah. I'd just love to see it when it's done. For sure. It's going to be another month, but... Yeah. In a month, then. Yeah, for sure. I'm going to go inside and grab a beer. - I'll see you around though, yeah? - For sure. Maybe tomorrow we could, like, grab dinner or something? I don't know... I got a shit ton of work that I should be doing right now, honestly. Okay, so do it in the morning, then. It's kind of like an all-day thing. Okay, yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, um... I don't know. I'm sorry. I just thought that because we slept together... I don't know. You'd think this is more special. But maybe that's my bad. No, I mean, it was special. It was super special, like, in the moment. I just feel like it wasn't significant. I just feel like those are two different things. I don't know. I saw you as a prospect? I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm super high and not really communicating properly. - I'm sorry. - No. It's cool, it's cool... You don't have to apologize. So I'm going to go. I'm going to go back to that party Fred was at. Yeah. That party was fun. I would really like to see you again. Yeah, just text me. I mean, I know I've been slow with the texts. I just have class all day and then I forget to respond. I just figured I'd see you when I'd see you. - Yeah totally. - Yeah, just text me. Okay, I'll text you. - Alright, bye. - See you. I'm going to be moving to Philly soon, so… Sweet. Bye. I don't know, it just feels like... He doesn't really know what I'm doing. I just feel like an idiot, right. Okay, thank you. I just feel like I really don't know what I'm doing because I'm, like, here. And he said that he really liked me. And I don't really understand... Okay, sorry. And I just don't understand like, why I wanted to be here. Yo. What the fuck are you doing here? Drinking! Do Mom and Dad know you're here? No. They think I'm sleeping over at Jenny's. They're so gullible. Don't talk about them that way. You act like you're so much smarter than them. But you're not. I promise you you're not. Why are you even here anyways? I'm moving here. Why? What am I going to do in New York? Um, get a job? But I have, like, no skills. What have you been doing in college for four years? Thinking, I guess. I have some coke. Do you want some coke? Where did you get it from? My friends gave it to me. Have you done it before? Yeah. It felt so good. - Yeah? - Yeah. It felt like every part of my body was exactly where it was supposed to be and doing exactly what it needed to do. So I hooked up with a really hot boy tonight. Oh yeah? What was his name? I think his name was Leo. He was mixed, also. Did you see him? No. I wasn't there for that long. Are you sure this party's going to be better? Yeah. Who the fuck makes a pop-up shop a destination? - Dude! - Get in the car. Hey, can you open the door? Thank you! Hey! Make a wish! Happy birthday! - It's melting! - Oh, shit! - Oh my God. - Hey, what's up? You brought your little sister! That is so responsible of you. - Did you see…? - No! We'll talk about it. - Is there more jungle juice? - Yeah, it's in the bathroom. Stop. I don't think you should drink any more. What, why? - You're too young. - Come on! I'm serious. If you keep doing that people will think you're this crazy slut or something. Are you serious? Okay. Maybe not, like, that. But people will take advantage of you. People will think you're a ditz. What's the matter with you? Oh my God. Nothing. I'm just trying to help you. Jesus. I'm going to go find my friends. Fuck it. - Oh hey. What's up? - Oh, shit, hey. How was the other party? Ugh, fucking sucked. Damn. - Is there any more in there? - Oh, yeah. There's, like, tons. Actually I'll come in with you and get some more. Whoa, okay. - So I did see Leo tonight. - Yeah? He's, like... kind of a huge asshole, isn't he? Why do you think that? I don't know. I just think he's kind of a huge asshole. He said you guys had a lot of fun. Probably because he, like, doesn't know how to have sex. Well, he said... you guys ugh... - I mean never mind. Whatever. - What? No. It's weird. Come on. Tell me. I won't, like, get offended. I, like, never get offended. Really? He said that you were pretty good in bed. - Yeah? - Yeah. What did you think when he said that? What do you mean? Like, is that what you expected? Yeah... I thought... I guess that made sense. Riley! Riley! - Hey, what's up? - I think your sister needs you. She's super wasted in the kitchen. I didn't know if I should call someone, - your parents... - Yeah, yeah, no you're right. - That's the right thing to do. - Everything okay? What's going on? Oh, nothing, we were just having a drink and talking for a sec. I'm gonna talk to Valerie, okay? One sec. Excuse me! Excuse me! Holy shit. Valerie. What's going on? Shit. Hey. The car was 25. Pay me when you can. Hope Val's okay. Riley? What are you doing here? I told you, I was sleeping over at Jenny's. I came home early - because I wasn't feeling well. - Stop lying! Then why you wearing those sorts of clothes? Don't lie to your mother! You were out! Mom, can you not speak Chinese right now? Please. Why? It's just difficult to process it right now. Because you're hungover? Riley, can you please just tell us the truth? I'd like to be left out of this. - Are you kidding? - No! You arrive here, unannounced, you have vomit all over you- I told you guys, I'm sorry I forgot to text you. I'm here to see that apartment. What apartment? What are you talking about? I'm moving here after graduation. Why? Why not? What are you going to do here? What am I going to do in New York? But why didn't you call us? It's not like you to just show up- None of this is making sense. Can someone please start telling me what is going on? Oh my God! I'm an adult! I'm allowed to come home whenever I want! Right? Isn't that what you guys said to me? Riley... Come with me. Come! Riley, what is going on with you? I don't know. What do you mean? Tell me. I can't believe I have to keep saying this. I'm. Here. To. See. An. Apartment. But why would you move here? You don't really have any friends left... and... I don't know. What about your friend Katie and all your other friends? I don't know! I guess I just want a change, okay? Why don't we talk about this after graduation? Okay... What? That's the other thing. I think I might have to take a summer class. What? Why? I don't know. I just think I do. I just didn't really have my shit together. Why do you keep saying that? What does that even mean? It means I messed up. And to get my diploma I need to take this class. And then you'll get it? And then you're done? - Yes. - How much? It's four credits. So however much that costs. Okay. I'll pay you back. I don't know. After I get a job or something I'll be able to pay you back. Let's do a deal. Okay? You tell me what happened last night with Valerie, and it's fine, I'll cover the costs. I just need to know what's going on with her. - What? - That's what I need. You know it'll help Valerie too. She's obviously going through something. Her rebellious stage. Mom, you're not serious. Valerie is always lying to me. She's always sneaking out. And she thinks we're dumb. She thinks she can get away with it. I just need to know. I can't help her if I don't know what she's doing. Okay... Last night... Are you kidding me? Drinking alcohol? Partying all night? Why are you doing this?! Why would you ever think of doing anything like this? - Aren't you ashamed? - Mom! You're grounded! I don't know for how long! Mom! Why are you doing this? What did I do wrong as a mother? - I'm so disappointed - Riley, I can't even look at you! You let this happen? I can't believe you told on me! They wouldn't pay for my summer class if I didn't, okay? - What summer class? - And I'm taking away your cell phone. I am taking away your cell phone. You greedy bitch! Valerie! Riley, what summer class? Aren't you graduating next week? So Riley just gets away with everything? - She did the same shit I did! - No. I'm taking away your credit card! Excuse me? Mom, you didn't say that. I don't know why you think you deserve that after what you did! You should be glad that's all! You're a terrible sister! I hate you! - You don't hate me! - Yes, I do! You're a bitch with no sense of loyalty and honestly? No sense of self! - Excuse me?! Fuck you! - Riley! Stop! What the hell's the matter with you? She's crazy! She's crazy! She's going out of her mind. You are insane! No wonder David left you! What! What did you say to me?! Riley! Calm down! Okay, calm down. Take some deep breaths. Get her a glass of water. - No, use the Brita. - It doesn't fucking matter. I don't know why you'd bring up David, Valerie, because you know how much he hurt me. We were together for three years and he just stopped, like, loving me. I don't even know how that happens. How does a person stop loving you? And now I just feel ugly all the time. And I feel like no boy wants to date me. And I don't know what to do anymore. I just know this can't be the rest of my life. It can't be. I just keep searching... in the dark for some kind of light or something to click and tell me that everything is going to be okay and what kind of person I'm supposed to be. And it just never happens. Riley, try to calm down, okay? I'm sorry, okay? Please don't be mad at Valerie. I should've stopped her. She's just a dumb kid and I should've stopped her. I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry. I'm just being so stupid, Valerie. I'm sorry. I'm just being so stupid. Okay... Group hug, okay? Come on. Group hug. Valerie. Group hug. Hey. Are you awake? Sort of. Mom made you these noodles. They're really good Cool. There's a lot of sesame oil on them. I just wanted to come say bye. I'm going back to New York in a sec. I thought you were touring an apartment here. No. I'm not. That was, like, so weird of me. - Okay. - Yeah. I actually have a meeting with a professor later because I failed her class. That sucks. Yeah. But I deserved it. Stop throwing yourself a pity party. How long are you going to be this sad for? I don't know. Because I'd be bored of it by now. Yeah. I think I've been bored of it for a while. - Are you still mad at me? - Yes. Alright. I'll leave you to it. - Bye. - Bye. Text me... oh wait. Fuck you. - Riley! - Sorry, sorry, sorry. - Bye. - Bye. - Riley!! - Sorry! Alright I'm going. Bye! I'd like to think that I'm not cold Pretend I'm not afraid of growing old Sadness hidden behind bad jokes I made it rain love letters They made their way into landfills I guess I learned my lesson So lucky heartbreaks can't kill I swear she was like, six years old. She was so little. I was pretty drunk. I mean, it's a graduation. It's a ceremony. It makes sense to be drunk. Hey. Hey, what's up? Gabby's not coming? No, I don't think so. She was like, “I need a little bit of a break,” so... Shit. No, yeah, it's cool. Like, I can't even think about it. Yeah. It's overwhelming. Yeah. Very overwhelming... I'm actually kind of sad. I can't believe it's the end. It's not the end. I won't let it be. You know that global warming is just a temporary thing. The Earth, when it reaches its breaking point, is going to reverse its charge, like a battery and then destroy everything and the world resets. Like back to its factory settings. But it's not instantaneous, you know? It takes a while. So we're definitely still going to have to deal with global warming and the O-zone being fucked up and there being no polar bears. Yeah, I mean, but I'm saying it doesn't matter because the Earth, like, knows what to do. It's going to happen way after we die, but it's going to happen. Okay, but that's like a really irresponsible way to think of your role as a conscious human being. But it's just what the science says. Where did you even read that? I read it in an article. - I think I saw that. - Yeah? Yeah. Okay, you guys. You can't believe everything you read in some article, anyway. Yeah. But you can't just live your life like the world's going to end. Holy shit. You need to stop scaring me, seriously. But that felt good though, right? - Um, maybe. - Here. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I see that. Can I kiss you? I don't think that's such a good idea. Yeah okay. I feel that. - Hey! - Hey! Don't. My dad's gonna kill you. No, he said I could finish it. We were working on it this morning together. Okay: Put on the line in quotes. Starting with “A.” It's six letters. It's in quotes, yeah. Air dry. Yes. I think that's it. Okay, do you wanna finish it with me? I feel like I'm so stuck on a few of these. I can't. I have to go. Oh my God! Good luck! I'm gonna be such a good artist's assistant... You're gonna be such a good artist's assistant... See you later! Bye, weirdo! - Have a good day. - Bye! Shit! Hi, this is Professor Hung's class, right? - Yeah, it is. - Cool. - What's your name? - Hi, I'm Riley. - I'm Charlie. - Nice to meet you Good to meet you. So why are you taking this class? Because I failed it last semester. So now I have to retake it to graduate. - Oh my God. That sucks. - Yeah, it's okay. I'm, like, very excited to be here. Are you, like, a senior? Or would you have been a senior? Like, I walked at graduation. So now this is the last step. Then I'm a real person. Then I'm an adult.
