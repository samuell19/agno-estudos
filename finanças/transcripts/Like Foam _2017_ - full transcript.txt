I think I'm falling in love with you. LIKE FOAM Sorry, I just wanted you to have fun. I did have fun. It was great when I fell on the step and when we got stuck for an hour and a half in the elevator. Yeah, OK, I messed up. We'll pick a better place next time. There won't be a next time. I don't fit in at gay clubs anymore. That's ridiculous. Ridiculous? Don't you see how they look at me? No, nobody's looking at you. You're paranoid. Whatever, I don't want to talk about it anymore. Milo! - That guy liked you. -Which one? In the club, the one you talked to with the beard. Yeah, that guy, the one who asked me how much my wheelchair cost because his mom wanted one for his 80-year-old grandma? You know people have weird pick-up lines. -Let's get breakfast. -I'm not hungry. I'll get sausage, since ours didn't see any action. It's not how they look at you, it's how you look at them. Nobody can get close, you scare them off with your I'm-miserable look. I am miserable. It's your birthday, you could take a break -from fighting the world. -I listened to you last night now I just want to sleep. All day. Fine, the night was shit, I admit it. I should be getting laid right now. -I'll make it up to you. -Leave me alone, dude! Milo, don't go to sleep. I swear on my mother. you're going to get laid. Pick up. You there? Need your help. Whatever you want, honey, I owe you. WHISKY POOL Sun's coming up, but not time to go home yet. Orgy and pool after-party at some friends' mansion. For all tastes. Come alone or with whoever you want. PASS IT ON! Gus! Is it here? You should know. What a house, huh? Should I ring? Are you sure? Sure about what? That you want to go in. Why not? Because I don't know what we're doing here... He recommended it, something different. Unpredictable. You and me, together. Yeah, but this isn't what I had in mind... What did you have in mind? Come on, tonight sucked... I don't want to go home. We have no idea what's in there... If we don't like it, we'll leave. What could go wrong? They aren't going to kidnap us. Oh, yeah? Maybe they will, we don't even know who sent the message. They might be organ smugglers. My friend Carla sent the message. Great. Where is she? I don't see her here. -At home, asleep. -See? Where we should be. Stay here if you want, I'm going in. No, I won't leave you on your own. Sorry, is this the orgy? The orgy? Yeah, it's here. You going in? What? Wanna watch? Whiskey, pool, whiskey, pool! Don't be so loud. Whiskey, pool, whiskey, pool What the hell are you doing? Who are all these people? Guests, for your birthday party. Who invited them? I sent a text to a friend. She owed me one. -Remember Camila? -No. She knows everyone and invited a few friends, and her friends are inviting theirs. I promise I'll keep it all under control. What kind of text? Dunno, a text for a fun party. Gus, kick everyone out. You hear? Excuse me, the bathroom? There are 13 in the house. One is enough. Not opening up, dude. Ring, damnit! Open up, assholes! You guys sure it's here? Yes, damnit. Look. -Blue dot. -Blue dot. -Blue dot. -Fucking blue dot, dude. -Hi. -Hi. -What's up? -Look at this house! About time, dude. Fuck me. ENOUGH TO BREAK THE ICE Guys, use this towel on the couch so it doesn't get stained. What's that? You have condoms, right? Use your heads, don't go too crazy, OK? Hurry up! What are you doing? Fitting in. Take your clothes off. What? I'm not getting naked. Jes√∫s, don't be a drag. What are you going to do? Don't know, improvise. It's... It's good to improvise sometimes. Like those sluts there? People are just having fun. Loosen up. What do you want from here? Something I don't know like the back of my hand. You want to fuck with someone else? Is that it? -See you at home. -No, no, no, no, let's go, please. We'll be unpredictable another day, but not here. You're not unpredictable. And you never will be. Marta! Marta! So? You see? You know you'll go broke taking care of this mess, right? Cannonball! I just wanted you to have a happy birthday. Should have gotten me a foam cannon. A foam cannon? Gus! Sweetheart! Hi, how are you? Hello. Hi. Um, fine. You must be Milo, such a pleasure. Gus told me so much about you. He never told me about you. He hardly listens when I talk to him. How's the party? It looks a little dead. I brought: this, a lot of this, and, this, just in case. Hello. Hi? Are you available? What? Are the chairs available? I guess so. You aren't taking any clothes off at all ? No, I don't know why I'm here. Why everyone else is. What else? Actually, I'm leaving now. Well, that's a shame. The best part starts now, it's all been foreplay up until now. This is disgusting. What were you expecting, crazy girl? I actually don't know what I was expecting. You don't like anything you see? At all? You've got it all, fat, bald, black... No. Oh, so you like munching carpet, right? Look, those two aren't bad. But I saw an old lady go by before - who was toothless, so... -Are you an idiot? And what's your deal with tits, so many fake boobs, -silicone really turns me off. -I'm leaving - because this isn't... -Yeah, leave, you don't want to keep all those friends waiting who aren't answering any of your texts, right? But look what time it is... What is your deal? You don't know me, it's none of your business. You're at an orgy, deal with it, chill out, and enjoy. You came for a reason, right? What about you? Why are you here? I'm looking for the love of my life. I've always known I'd find them at an orgy, sooner or later. Then start looking, and leave me alone. Calm down, nothing's wrong, OK? You can't rush at an orgy, you have to find the right time to join in. -Grab it. -Do it again. Almost! Your aim is fucking good. What the hell do you have inside there? Here's another. Isn't it incredible? What's up? Hey, how are you? -What are you doing? -What do you think? Fuck no, go away. -Leave. -Why? The three of us are cool together. This is private, go away. -What's she think? -Dude, leave. Isn't this an orgy? You're pretty selfish, aren't you? Hey, you! Looking for me? Hi. Hi. You know how much a polar bear weighs? Sorry? Enough to break the ice. Cool. Do you like anal or pussy sex more? Sorry, I'm with someone. Who? You were with someone but they left, I saw them. With him. -Where was it? -Not a clue. Please save me from this freak. Which one? Right now, it's all total chaos, finding their bodies and some flesh to put in their mouths, doesn't matter from where. In a while, all these people will find their place, thinking it's all under control but all of a sudden, bam! That's when I'll make my stellar appearance and shake it all up again. You look like an expert. It isn't complicated, or weird, it's what happens every day on the outside. People trying to fit in. Yeah, like Tetris. Exactly, like Tetris. You just have to know which piece you are. Which piece are you? The one you never know where to put, the tricky one. Like this. The one who always messes up the line. I'm the straight line, horizontal, vertical, whatever, I'm always good for something. You're a nutjob. You remind me of myself my first time like, I don't know why I'm here, this isn't my thing. How many have you been to? Orgies? Places like here? I don't keep track. From 18 to 24. But I can tell you that no two are the same. And the one today looks pretty amazing. Why? Because you're here. I already told you that I'm not joining in. But I can feel your energy in the ambiance. You're different, and that makes this one special. My energy's nothing special. That's what you think. My name is Jorge. OK. Your name's OK? Nice to meet you, OK. Elisa. A pleasure, Elisa. Hey! You! Get out of my room... Milo? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? This is my house. Your house? You live here? -Let's fuck, come on. -No. How long since we last saw each other? Ten years. And...? You doing well? -Come on, let's fucking do it. -Take a hike, dude. I'm doing just great. I have to go. No, no, no, no. Again? Godamnit! Come on. Sorry, no, excuse me. Good morning, do you rent out foam cannons? it says you do online. OK, thank you. Foam cannons? -It's a personal thing. -Fine with me. Are you..? Yeah, six months. You shouldn't be here. You should go home. Why? Because of the state you're in. You don't look like you're in a good state, yourself. You leave. I can't. I set this all up. You invited us all? Something like that. Well, it's getting a bit out of control. I know, but I'm trying to keep it under control. What good is control? That isn't whiskey, is it? Hi. I was told you were the dealer guy, well, dealer chick. Who would say something so vulgar? What are you looking for? In life? That's a broad question. Don't know, happiness, like everyone else, right? No, I mean here, at this house. Oh, here... To make friends. Don't you think this place is full of lifelong, solid friendships? You messing with me? What are you looking for? A full-fledged woman like you. Old, you mean... No, no, no, you're not old, you're perfect. I'm looking for something, or someone, I guess... Say no more. Your husband. No. I don't have one anymore... He left you. He died. Suicide. For real? I make men want to die. Don't I scare you? I'll kill you with pleasure in bed. We'll be even. I'm looking for someone else. If you want, I'll help you look for whoever you want. KISSING AND ORGIES What are you doing? Taking notes, statistical data... What for? Because I'm writing an essay. An essay? Yeah, a study on human behavior at orgies. You are definitely a nutjob. You think so? Look closely... Out of all of them, how many are kissing? On the mouth, I mean... Nobody, right now... And that's my thesis. Kissing is the least-common practice at orgies. So what's your conclusion? It's simple: kisses are real and deep down, they terrify us. What? Kissing take you to the next level or they kill your mood. When you kiss someone, you're taking a risk because that person will know if they really like you or not. If they're attracted or grossed out by you. Yeah, or if their spit creeps you out because some spit is really disgusting. Exactly. But that kind of sincerity isn't so common at an orgy. Kisses make you more naked than taking your clothes off. -You can't fool someone with... -You can't fool someone with... -a kiss. -a kiss. Where did you come from? Aren't I cool? -Selfie! -OK, fine. I'd kill for a cigarette. No, you can't smoke. Hello, good morning, do you rent foam cannons? Yeah, really? I'm on my way. I have to go, please tell me you'll behave yourself. I'll behave, but, when you get back, we're hooking up. I'm not into girls. Ever been with one? No. Then you don't know. Look, I thought I hated cauliflower for years and now I love it. You stick with your first impression, you don't do any more research. Whatever you say. I'll be back in a bit. Gus! You're an uncontrollable guy, don't you forget that. Who was the guy you came with? My husband. Where is he now? He left. Where to? Home, I guess. Everything OK? Obviously... not. My husband bores me, and it's even more boring to talk about him, so let's change the subject. I don't want to think. I want to have fun, and... Fuck someone else? Why not? Hi. Hello. The therapist said we're in a "dead marriage" phase, you know? No. Well...we're lacking liveliness... So you don't fuck, I get it. I mean, we fuck... Once per month, twice at the most. More or less. -You a fortune-teller? -Obviously. No, we're just in an apathetic phase. We don't share anything exciting. That's what the therapist said. Yeah. That's why you came here, to do something exciting. I didn't want to, but I guess so. Marta says I'm too predictable. Show her you're not. Right now, you and I are going to go take a little walk and we'll find something unpredictable for you to do. Like what? Because I had enough with that ping-pong ball chick. -I'd never seen anything like it. -I have, on TV. You a chick or a guy? Sweetheart, can't you see me? I'm all woman. Yeah, yeah, I can see that. But I mean... What do you mean? Between your legs. What? If you got an operation or if you've got a dong? My love, the question isn't what I have between my legs. The question is, what do you want me to have? Are you OK? Mario's here. Mario who? Mario. No way. What's he doing here? Dunno, your trannie friend must have brought him, like all the others. Gus, get these people out of my house. Please. It's too late for that, Milo. This is getting out of control. Where are you going? Out. Just for a moment. I'll explain later. You're leaving me here, with all these weirdos? No worries, I'll stay with you, right? -Hi, Gus. -Hello, Mario. What? It's breakfast time. How old are you? How old do you think? Thirteen? Shouldn't they ask for your ID at orgies? No, I'm almost twenty years old. Twenty very full years. I'm sure, but... you sure you like girls? Because you sure look like a Eurovision fan... Hey! I'm a man's man! With hair on my chest and everything. -Yeah, you'll fuck like a champ today. -Yeah, it's about time. -It's about time? -Are you a virgin? A little bit. A little bit virgin? -What do you mean? -Yeah, I'm a virgin. So? Marta will take your virginity. Yeah, sure... Don't you want to show your husband that there's no looking back? Yeah, show him! So...do you have goods or not? Goods, goods, yes, I've got goods. You mean this? Yeah. How much you asking? One kiss. What? It's yours if you give me a kiss. -Where? -Where else, sweetheart? OK, fine. OK. -That's it. -That's it? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure you can do much better. -Come on. -Yeah? Let's see, go slow, OK? Don't be rough. Be gentle, I'm a delicate girl. What? It's cool. Of course it's cool. Hey, you're in a fucking hurry, I'm not such an easy girl. You aren't leaving? I'm going to stay a bit more. -A bit more... -What? -Elegant and subtle. -OK. You're a teacher? Not everyone has to know. How old are your students? 12, 13. I would've loved to have a teacher like you! Oh, yeah? Why? Teacher during the week, orgy queen on the weekend... Queen? I'm nothing like a queen.. Show me his picture again. What the hell did you see in him? -It's a long story. -But why are you looking for him? Let's just say... he wasn't very sincere with me. We'll find him if he's here. Dumbass will get what's coming to him. -Don't push me, I can do it. -Fine, OK. Gus still hung up on you, huh? What? Dude, it was obvious. To all of us. In college... That's why he hated me. Gus hated you because... he knew what you did to me. And he's my friend. Nothing more. And he's helping me a lot now. So... what happened? OK, you don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about anything. Not with you. I'm sorry. It was an accident. When? Not that long ago. I'm sorry. It's fine. Life goes on, as they say. I'm also sorry about... us... you know. From ten years ago. You'll think it's dumb, but... I've thought a lot about you. Every time I went back to the places you and I discovered together. You're right. I do think that's really dumb. And suddenly, you're here, you know? Dude, as if this party wasn't weird enough. Where'd this house come from? It's my grandpa's. Roco? Shit! How is he? Dead. My cousins and I inherited it. I'm staying provisionally. Until I find an adapted house. Because my apartment's a beautiful, walk-up attic. But we're selling it right away, if these people don't wreck it first. Yeah. Want to go somewhere? Where? Let's get out of here, all I see are dicks. -Let's go. -Wait a minute, shit. Wait, we'll go in a minute. -What are you doing? -You've got to be unpredictable. -Yeah, but come on. -Let's see. we're here, let's watch. That's all. -No. -Yes. OK, no, wait. Jes√∫s. OK, fine. -No -¬°Jes√∫s! OK, come on, let's go. It's OK, that's it. UNCONTROLLABLE Today marks 34 days since my boyfriend left me. You know, I'm not surprised? It's like you're wearing a sign on your forehead. I don't know why, because I'm just fine. Right. The thing is... he said I don't know how to enjoy sex. But I do know how, I just don't know how to... be slutty or talk dirty. Yeah. I think I have a vocabulary problem. He asked me to say things like: "fuck me raw," or... ‚Äùeat my pussy," but it didn't come out right, it came out more like ‚Äúeat my vajayjay‚Äù, He lost his concentration... No, don't laugh. -Sorry. -I went to school with nuns. If you cussed there, Sister Magdalena washed your mouth out with soap. And now, wherever I am, I always see her there. Seriously? Sister Magdalena is here right now, watching all this? Dummy. And that's why you came to an orgy. To prove to yourself that you can be dirty. I went out with girlfriends last night, to go conquer the world... and everyone hooked up except for me, as usual. Because I'm a fake. I don't think you're a fake. You just need to let loose, because I'm sure, deep down, you're a really dirty girl. Thank you. You're welcome. What are you doing? Screwing up your thesis on kissing and orgies. Well... No silicone at all. I like you. You know what? No. You do remind me of myself a few years ago, when nothing was serious and it was all about just waiting for the right person. What's it about now? Healing as soon as possible. Almost all the time. But your heart's never been broken, am I right? You break it. I'll let you destroy it, if you want. I want my own scars, too. Too much responsibility. And these guys never stop fornicating... What's wrong? You said "fornicate‚Äù. And that, sounds a lot like Sister Magdalena. I don't want to be here. -Never seen anything like this? -No. Well, once. Where? It was porn, but an accident, OK? I put a video on and it popped up... -The porn? -Yeah. Yeah. -I guess you turned it off right away. -Yeah. Well, not right away, but I only watched a little bit. Just a part, then I turned it off. -A part and you turned it off. -Yeah, I turned it off. Well then, look close. Let's give the show a chance. Kiss him. I'm going to laugh. Quit horsing around, concentrate. Come on. Dude, open your mouth. -You a kissing virgin, too? -Well, almost... -Come on, try again. -OK, that's enough. What do you mean, that's enough? Aren't you serious? Serious about what? Oh, so you were bluffing about cheating on your husband. No. No, but now you're chickening out. Chickening out is rude. Well, I thought we were just screwing around. I'm not screwing around. Me, either. Yeah, like that. Fucking great. -All your clothes off. -Yes, sir! Condom. Don't have one. -Know how to put it on? -I think so. Get rid of that. -What are you doing? Put it on. -Yeah. Can I see? Wow, he's... No. No. OK, goodbye. Nobody has seen this guy. But we can keep looking. Nothing better to do, right? He'll be getting his today, you'll see. You didn't tell me your name. People call me Pato. Is that short for your real name? No, it means duck in Spanish. -Are you a duck? -No. Not so much. Quack. Come on, let's go up there. Nobody will bother us. No. Hey, I'm built, OK? I can handle you. No, it's a bad idea. Come on, man, today is a day for strong emotions. I've had enough already. Trust me. OK, better not ask that. But listen to me, I'll do whatever you ask after, I'll be your slave. I want nothing from you. You'll think of something. No. How are you going to stop me? Hey! Mario. Give me a hand. Let's go, this is a piece of cake. You're heavy! Damn, you're heavy, dude! But I can handle you! DRAMA QUEENS What am I? What are you sucking and licking? -It's good. -Am I an ice cream? I'm flying high. Is that so? Well... come back down to earth, sweetheart. What's up with you? You the little mermaid? You see a fish tail on me? You liked that, huh? Stop, stop, stop. Bet you didn't expect this? Wow, man. -Already? -Move over, come on. If you aren't with Gus, then with who? Do I look like I'm with someone? I don't know. You always were a heartbreaker. Yeah, until I got mine broken. Who? No, give me his address and I'll beat him up. I messed up, with you. We were drama queens. That's also true. It was rough. But I got over it, and then I had to worry about other things. This I've learned: things can always get worse. They can also get better, after getting worse. I don't know. Don't you want to know if I'm with anyone? I hope you're not with the one you kicked out of my bed. I'm pathetic, huh? We all are. We fit in here, today. Totally out of control, huh? Gus is an idiot. Gus set all this up? Something like that. He's dead-set on me getting laid on my birthday. Shit, it's your birthday! That's right, August 4th. I hate birthdays, especially this one. When did you start hating everything? So this whole mess is to get you laid. You could have just called me. Right. Happy Birthday... -Stop. Happy Birthday to you. -Stop. Happy Birthday, dear Milo, Happy Birthday to you... ..to me. I never felt the same with anyone after being with you. Now sing me the, For he's a jolly good fellow... For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow... Which nobody can deny. I think I'm falling in love with you. Where's your chair? Shit. Don't worry about it. I can handle you. Am I hurting you? Not anymore. That's it, oh. Thank you. You're welcome, man. I know, I'll find your wheelchair, but I'm taking a break, you're a little heavy. Besides, having you kidnapped is addictive. You can't get away from me. What if I rape you? You want to get out of here? Where to? What time is it? An afternoon snack? It will look like a date. When they ask us, I'm willing to lie about where we met. What should we say? At the movies? Yeah, watching an X-rated movie. On the subway, then. A library? In the sociology section, right? Perfect. They won't believe us, anyway. Touch higher or I can't feel it. Tell me you forgive me. Who shut the gate? -Hello! -Hey! Listen, little mermaid. I want to kiss you again. Oh, yeah? Fine, but you have to ask me out first. -OK. -Like boys do with girls. I'm asking. Sweetheart, you have to do it right. How? On your knees. Honey, like that. And now you can ask me. I really like you and I want you to go out with me. You really are so bland. What is that racket? My ears hurt. Hello, good morning. Good afternoon, now. THE CANNON Bravo, guys. -I have to go. -Right now, so soon? To look for my wife. Jes√∫s! Marta! That was pretty great, huh? Wow, it's great! Grab here. Be careful, it's a rental. Don't be shy, help us out. You look like you're falling asleep. Not asleep, you're high as a kite, look at your face, sweetie, as if this was the first time we did this. Careful. This cannon deserves respect. Selfie, guys! And here comes the selfie dude. Honey, I've been around the block a few times now. I can't get through. Hey, blondie, help me, honey. Look at those eyes! Are you Scandinavian? Oh, my prince! Thank you. Now, you see? That's what I meant. Little things like that make a girl feel like a woman. That's him, isn't it? Are you OK? Mario went to find my chair. It was in the pool, underwater. What's with the grin? What grin? Yeah, you almost smiled. He said he's never felt the same after me. That fate brought us together again for a reason. And a ton of other stuff. Yeah. -But... -What? He's said the right thing before. I don't buy it, I'm over that shit. What? Nothing to say? Don't know what to say. You're a mess. No, I'm not. And it's late. We're kicking everyone out, and Mario goes first. I liked seeing you grin, anyway. An illusion, Gus. Nothing wrong with illusions. It's OK to be happy sometimes. It's no crime. I can't be happy anymore. Go to the yard! I want you to see something. -Hi, Jorge. -Hi. Remember me? Yes, Susana. This is Pato. -Elisa. -Hello. We were just leaving. Going to do the same thing to her? What did he say? His theory on kissing at orgies? That he'll lie about how you met, right? He told me the same. But I never heard from him again after he said goodbye. No calls, no texts... Don't feel special. He does it with everyone. That's really messed up, dude. So? See? He's an idiot. I had fun, thanks. No need to thank me. Any plans for tonight? Why? I'm not tired, we could get a drink. Like a date? I think I have to work. You never told me your job. Guess. Security guard. Really? I look like a security guard? Security guard, a cop, something to do with making us all feel safe. I fuck for cash. Come on, seriously? Seriously. I'm a gigolo, a whore, whatever you want to call me. What? I'm here for work. There's always someone at these parties who gets left out and has no qualms paying so people think they scored. Orgy posing. That's how us whores call it. So now what? What do you mean? Are you going to send the bill to √Ålvaro and me, or...? Absolutely not. It was my pleasure. But maybe I can still find a customer, this is when people get desperate. Wow, you found it! Gus did, it was in the swimming pool. In the pool! What? You need to go. Why? It's my turn. You said you'd do whatever I asked, and I'm asking you to leave. I won't let you push me away. I'm not leaving. You have to kick everyone else out with me. I'll never forgive you. You can't just show up after 10 years and kiss me. Why not? Because it's irresponsible. Tell me you didn't feel what I felt upstairs in your room. I didn't feel what you felt. Liar. You're where you should be, like a painful memory to be forgotten. And you're staying there. I'm not a memory, I'm here. You left, Mario, you disappeared. You're just here by chance. Loving someone has nothing to do with chance. Fine, OK, I took off and really hurt you. I'm sorry, but I didn't know what I wanted. Milo, now I do know. I look at you, and feel like those 10 years led me here, to this moment, to this place. I don't want to be anywhere else. Gus, this is private. I want to show Milo something, in the yard. Honey, it's not a drum, - this isn't a drum circle. -OK. Let me, I know a thing or two about cannons. Wow. Stick your snout in there. Look, this is the water wrench, open the valve. Open. You just closed it. What did you do? -You break it? -I didn't break anything. Well, then, I just don't get it. See? It's dripping, after all that banging around. You can't be in charge of anything. I don't know if it's plugged in, did you plug it in? -This wire here. -It's charged. Just like you. What's this doing here? I brought it. My dad gave me a foam cannon when I turned 18. I know. I do listen when you talk. Turn it on. No way. Come on. No, Gus, I'm not flooding my yard with foam. Sweetheart, this doesn't work. That's impossible. I'm sure Milo knows how to turn it on! Turn it on! Turn it on! You didn't shut up about the foam cannon when - you turned 18. -That was another lifetime. Not so long ago. Elisa, Elisa please, Elisa. I'm leaving, OK? -I'm going with you. -No. Why not? I don't know why I'm here. It was stupid to come, and it's stupid to leave with you. Elisa, you have nothing to do with her. It doesn't matter. We met here, and no matter how hard I try, I'm never going to be... dirty. You're addicted to human behavior at orgies. I don't even know what that is. I just want a normal guy. Foam, foam! Foam, foam! Come on, your party is fizzling out. Can't you see it's broken? You try. You just have to press the "ON" button. But you have to want it. Yeah, but for real, you have butter fingers. You have to stick your finger in. -Stand back! -Look at all that smoke! Be careful how you feel here, this place is deceptive. It's like that bubble of foam, the bubble is going to burst in a little while. You'll go back home and you'll have to make decisions, all on your own. Always alone. Take care of yourself, Marta. You, too. WHEN PEOPLE GET DESPERATE Everything I said was true. Yeah, fine, but that means I'm your truth for this weekend. Isn't that all we've got? What we feel, what's truly here and now. I want to be your normal guy. I can be your normal guy, but... You might have to help me a little. You do deserve to get your heart broken. For it to really hurt. Like I said: you do it. I will, and you'll be screwed. Deal. If I see him again, I'll punch his face in. Forget it, I'm fine. That idiot. You know when you try so hard to find something and then you realize you were more obsessed with the search than what you wanted to find? No, no , no. Is that a metaphor? Something like that. Maybe you're right. I wasn't even really looking for him. You weren't? Maybe I was looking for you. But I've been here the whole time. Oh, OK, another metaphor. I'm not very good with metaphors, you know? Don't worry. No more metaphors. I'll be clear. That'd be better. Kiss me. Can I have your number? Or Instagram or Facebook, at least? You want me to go, too, don't you? I want Milo to be OK. And I'm not good for him, am I? It's been a long time, Mario. It was fucked up when you disappeared. You were there to comfort him, right? I learned to love him the right way. And how's that? How is it? Denying your feelings for him. Does that make you happy? Your happiness can't mow over everything else. Think about what makes him happy, it's not that complicated. So you throw him parties? To find his knight in shining armor? I hadn't seen him smile for a long time. What? Milo. In his room, earlier. I want to stay, Gus, in his life, forever. Help make him understand. How was your day? Hectic. Yours? Intense. There's no hope for us, is there? We'll be fine, you'll see. I promise I'll put the house back like it was. I'll pay for everything. I'm not angry. Not even a little? I kicked Mario out. Uh-huh. Uh-huh? What was I supposed to do? Go with it, I guess. It's good to lose control sometimes. I realized that today. Going with it only leads to regrets. But some regrets are better than others. I screwed up, didn't I? He hasn't left yet, I just saw him, walking through the foam. What? Run. Thanks for the foam, Gus, and the best birthday of my life. Want to be the woman of my life? See? That's better. Since you're here, ask me to marry you, too. Do you want to marry me? I thought you'd never ask! Yes. What about your wife? If you want to hang out someday, to talk about it, or whatever you want. As friends, I don't know. Maybe I would. Whenever you want. Thanks, man. You're welcome, unpredictable man. Fucked-up mess, huh? Never better said. You didn't get laid? No, I've been busy today. If you've got 120 bucks, we can fuck. You seen a pregnant girl around? She's right there. I think I'm out of control. About time. I'm leaving, OK? You don't have to kick me out again. What were you thinking about? How to love someone responsibly, or the right way. You drive me crazy with your weird concepts. I'm not like that, I don't know how. Wanna hear something irresponsible? Stay. But my life's complicated right now. As if mine isn't. I don't care. We'll figure it out, right? You don't know what you're saying. What's the worst that can happen? Chaos, tears, destruction. So? We're drama queens, nothing scares us. Should we go to the foam? Maybe I do need you to push me a little now. I'll bring you. Good. You turn me on, dirty girl. -Fuck me raw! -You're improving. This is going to be really sordid. I love sordid love stories. LIKE FOAM
