Either you eat your supper, or you go to bed. Come on. Quick… or I’ll take the kitchen spoon to you. Don’t get undressed! - Why? I’m hot. - Nonsense! Come on, hurry, and no television. You’re going to bed. - I haven’t finished watching television. - You’re going to bed. Milda, be a good boy. - What do you say? - Milda, a little fish for you. - It will swim about in your tummy, eh? - Just think clearly while playing. - Come on, what do you say? - Good night! - Bye bye! Now we’ll put you to bed and read you a fairytale. A really nice one, shall we? Once upon a time, there was a princess, and she was a very proud princess. - Surely that doesn’t hurt anymore? - Just a little. - And now? - Now it hurts a lot. It’s that ankle of yours again. We’ll have to watch it. It’s always when I do a somersault. That’s the jump-off leg. Tomorrow, you must really be careful on it. I’ll only wrap it lightly and overnight a warm wet wrap. And tomorrow I’ll have to do some exercises anyhow. Do you think that somersault was good? It was really bent and that doesn’t happen often. Bent? You mustn’t let up, then everything will be okay. - No, I’ve got no cards, nothing else. - Really incredible. How can you lead with a heart, when you know I’ve got no hearts! - Vera, what did you have in your hand? - Spades. - What about you Pepek? Jirka, that takes the biscuit. He does it on purpose, it’s impossible. I’m not going to play cards with you again. We’re going home! Alright, let’s stop. It always ends this way. Let’s go then. With you, every game ends like this. Where’s my purse? Here somewhere? Here it is. - Stop giggling will you! - Alright, alright, alright! Where’s my purse? I don’t know, somewhere in the bathroom maybe. - It’s not there. - When does the next bus or train leave, Dáda? My goodness it’s cold outside. - Are there no sandwiches left over? - No, I ate the last one. - I fancy a bite of something. - I’ll make you something if you like. Like what? - Scrambled eggs maybe. - Too heavy before bed. Well, there’s nothing else. I’m in here just now. Stop that for goodness sake. It’s terrible, I haven’t got anything to wear. You say that every day. What was it that I wanted…? Ow… What’d you want to do with that? Tomorrow Mrs Navrátil’s bringing the laundry over. I must set it for seven. I’ve already set it for six, didn’t you hear? I’ve got to get up then. At six? Mrs Navrátil can go to hell, if I don’t get any clean white shirts back. Anyhow, you said you were going to save. - What about it? - What about it? If it wasn’t for Mrs Navrátil, we could have bought a car by now. Well, if we’re saving, turn out the light. "This is a house. People live in this house. They feel great in this house." So, how is it going with the tiles? I told you I was going to just take a look. I still can’t walk on it. But just look at how dreadful they are. - Blow on it, if it’s hot. - No it isn’t. - Why aren’t you eating? It’s hot at the bottom, but cold on the surface. I made it without onions, just as you asked. Sit still. Keep your legs still under the table! And they were happy, and the whole family was happy, because all of them were truly happy. Eva, jump off. Hold it! No, that’s too soon! You’ve got to wait! Then onto your extended hands. Surely you can do an upstart? Once more! - My hands are burning. - Burning or not burning, it’s got to be done. You can do an upstart, so do a proper one. Wait just a moment more and then close with the arms in front. Hold it there. It was a bit better, but… Come on then. The start off isn’t enough. You have to be more like this to swing properly to stretch it and then you could really pull with your arms to get up. Come on, Eva, Let’s try all of it. Crawl out from under there! I am not going to crawl after you. Milda! Get out, now! My God, look at the carpet. You have to constantly be washing yourself. There was something I wanted… Stop ringing that bell, for goodness sake! Mummy, it keeps falling off every minute. Who allowed you to touch the vacuum cleaner? Now, look at that… - My goodness, you’ve broken it! - What have I broken? You broke this bit here. It could’ve only been you, it wasn’t like that before. - How I am supposed to do the carpets? - We’ve got another one. Milda, the brush! Let go of it this minute! I told you it was something you must never touch! My last brush, what should I do with it now? Milda? Come on. And now give me a kiss. What kind will it be, a raspberry one? And now we’ll promise to be really well-behaved today. No, dress me first… But this is not being good like we promised. Now this one, and the other one. You little rascal! You see, when you sleep well, you’re all happy and it is fun with you. Mummy, I’ll never do it again. Milda, please, this is dreadful. You don’t let me live! Come now, quickly. My purse. - You can surely hold out a few minutes. - No, I can’t! When we come back from doing the shopping, you’ll have a rest. Come on! Come here! Stop that! Look what you’re doing! Mum! I will tell daddy about everything! Off you go! I simply don’t know what to do with Milda. - I don’t have the strength for it. - Try, you can do it. You see, much better! It’s better now. I will try one more time then, right? Let’s leave it and try the other part. Here’s your soup and take it. At once! I’m not going to fight with you. You can see how hot it is. - Alright, cool it, blow on it! - No. Get on with it, Milda, hurry up! What’s wrong with it? Come, that’s no way to sit at a table. Sit nice and straight, your hands on the table. What’s this in it, what have you put in this soup? What do you think I’ve put in it? Cut this out. - Take it out for me. - I won’t take anything out. - Me neither. Jesus Christ, I am fed up with this. Here’s another one for you. - You’ll get such a box on the ear. - No mummy, it fell, it fell. What are you hitting me for? I’ll never pretend any more. - So where do we go from here? - Just a minute. Look Eva, the bars have been good from the start. It’s dynamic, you’ve got everything: steps, jumps, enough difficult elements. I feel like an image, a pose of some kind is missing. - Something static? - That’s right. A pose with an element of surprise. Turn around and stand. Try it now. Turn! Try to strike an attitude something like this and extend this arm... shoot it out, so that it has a gymnastic character. With the other leg, it’s an attitude we want and not an arabesque. Let’s see. No, that’s not it. You’re performing as if you were at the ballet barre again. Try to make a horizontal stance again. Raise this leg. Higher, higher! - Still more? - Still higher! - I can’t! - Of course you can. Alright, wait a second. Come on down. We’ll try it this way. Grab this leg with your hand. Stretch your leg out all the way. - I can’t. - Yes, you can. Higher, come on! Catch hold of it. Who do you think is going to hold it up for you? Now, let go of that hand, get your balance, shoulders down. - I’m not steady… - Hold it. We’re not pretending to fight cocks here. Get into the pose once more! The other side. And now extend it as before. Turn out your heel! Shoulders down. Don’t puff your chest out, we’re after the line! Arms up and keep the pose. Get your balance. - Holding it? - Yes. Right, that’s what we want. So now, come on up here, onto the beam. - I’ve got to do it up there? - Onto the beam. - Jump! - How am I to do it? You’ll go straight into the pose out of the turn. Turn. And quickly back down! Just a minute. Got it all right? Come on now. - And kick out from the turn! - How do you think I can kick it out? You can’t do it at the moment because you’re like a cyclist in the wind. This is the whole trick. You must turn and shoot out you leg straight from the turn and hold the pose. It must be a surprise, otherwise it’s no use. The pose is good, but the execution isn’t worth beans. Right… and full stop! And now join it up! That means long step. Your front leg should be fully extended. Stop. A handstand. Now get your balance. Above your head, Eva! No heavy-weight could support that! Up. Pull down your shoulders, slowly down. And hold it! Good. And what now? Hello Hasan! What do you say to that, Tarzan? I think it was good. You’re an excellent coach, but I think it could still do with a little polishing. And then, how to follow up the pose? - We’ll have a somersault, won’t we? - A cartwheel. That’s what’s missing! - An ordinary cartwheel? - It won’t be just an ordinary cartwheel. We’ll have to come up with a neat transition. - Come on, we’ll carry on for a bit. - Wait a minute, damn it, my shoe again. - Thank goodness, you turned up at last. - Now Vera! Your office called. I was afraid something had happened to you. You shouldn’t read at the table. Give it to me. What did I just tell you? Is this the way you’re bringing him up? He’s right. I wait for you the whole day, and then you come home and read the newspaper. I can’t even have a little peace at home? When am I supposed to read the paper? I haven’t had a spare minute the whole day. Don’t get excited. When your work’s finished, it’s finished. Mine’s never done. Mummy, come here! What is it now? Well, what is it? What’s wrong, when else am I supposed to read it? Come on down, let’s go on with it. There was something I wanted… But what was it? One, two, three, four… It’s alright, but the straddle isn’t striking enough. What are you going to do at the competition: somersault or straddle? - What about the long fly? - I think that would be the best. - I haven’t done that jump for ages. - But you can’t lose with it! Let’s try it, come on! What’s the matter? We can’t go on like this, Eva. So let’s practice the somersault. The somersault. Get going, get going! What’s happened? For goodness sake. What have you done? - I wanted to do a long fly. - Come and sit down. - Wait, leave me be! You can’t do that. When I say ‘I’m going to go a somersault’, I can’t suddenly change to a long fly. - Have you hurt your hand? - No, I’ve just winded myself. Are you crazy? You can’t do things like this. What am I supposed to make of all this? - Have you hurt yourself? - Leave me alone, it’s alright now. If there’s nothing wrong, then get on with it! Listen Eva, it’s really important that you do the jump after the fall. Go on! - I don’t know. - You’ll manage it this time alright. - I won’t make it. - You’ve got to! As if we’ve got time for this kind of thing today? Concentrate and you’ll pull it off okay. Are you afraid, or what is it? - I’m not doing it. - What’s this, ‘I’m not doing it.’ - I’ve had enough. - This really tops it off. I’m fed up with this whole business today. It was really unnecessary. I know, it was silly of me. But I simply can’t go on. No wonder really. You haven’t let up even for a little bit. What about taking the afternoon off? And what would we do? We could go to the cinema, and then to a concert or an art exhibition. Then we’ll go to the seaside and do some reading. Stop here a moment. I want to buy myself some new shoes. Wait for me, round the corner there. What are you buying again? What do you mean, again? - What am I buying? - Have a look. - Nope, they’re not here. - Look, there they are. - Where are they? - A whole pile of them. Come to think of it, maybe Ivan took them. You see! Before I can get down to reading anything, you’ve gone and lent the book to someone. What if it was Luboš? That would be too stupid. It would be stupid really, not to let him in. - Did he say he was coming by? - I don’t know, maybe. I don’t care. I don’t want to see anybody at the moment. What’s that? You must know what that is, this one’s ancient. Ah, I know now. Funny that it never occurred to me before. - It’s good, really. - What are you thinking about again? It would go wonderfully alongside my free exercises! I’m fed up with all this saving. I can’t afford to buy anything. There must be something wrong with my arm. No stockings, no nothing. I wonder if it’s rheumatism? And I must go for a face treatment! Such a strange tingling sensation. Right down to my fingertips. Like ants crawling. Your arm just got numb. No wonder, if you keep holding it up like that. Are you going to read? You’re not even going to tell me what’s new? That women can’t iron. Did she send it into the wringer or what? And this one’s quite yellow. It’s only a little scorched, it’ll wash out next time. So I’m supposed to wait for the next batch of washing, when I’ve only got a couple of these white shirts. Tomorrow I will buy myself two nylon shirts and that’s that. You can’t, you’ve got to save. - So the washing will be done at home. - Yeah, right. Do without Mrs Navrátil? You know we can’t do that. I haven’t a thing to wear either, and just because of that stupid car. I’m not going to work myself to death. I’d like to see how you’d be if you had to spend the whole day with Milda. They won’t take him at the nursery school, that’s dead certain. Why? I’m not a working woman and don’t look so surprised. - So you see. - See what? I see how hard they work on their coffees in the office across the way. I work a hundred times harder. And put your arm down. Are you taking in anything I’m saying at all? This needs to go to the cleaners. What’s new at the office? You never tell me anything at all. Look here! - Hey, look here! - Nice. - I’d love to get it. Pachman didn’t lose today. You are weird, Vera. And five goals to nil. What a bagful! The boys didn’t expect that! Adamec, right. Come on, one more minute, it’s already… It’s gonna end 5:0, clearly. What’s wrong? Where are you going? Good morning. Anyone calls? What about the little one? Last night, he asked for you. But right now he’s still asleep. - Do we have milk? - No, I haven’t had time to go for it. - Bye. - Thank you. Hi! Full steam ahead! It’s not possible to go at it like that. What do you think? - Make a leap at it, no hesitation. - I can’t, I suppose I’m afraid. Here’s a strong man standing, holding you. What more do you want? You must realize one thing: if you don’t do a proper jump now, everything’s lost. It’s no use. I’m not trying it anymore. Go and take up your position once more! Go on quickly! This will be my last contest and I would like to end my competitive career at home, in Czechoslovakia. We can all understand that, Eva, but tell me now what you consider the main factors in your success? Perhaps that my performance links up acrobatic, gymnastic and balletic elements, and that I actually began with ballet training and that I simply wanted to try a different kind of exercise. What message do you have, as an Honoured Master of Sport, for our young people? Some advice? Some advice? That young people should practice every day, and do all the prescribed training to win as many championships as possible in their youth and to understand that sport is not only for the good of your health… Eva, will you at least tell me what’s the matter with you? What’s the matter? What more do you want to know, I’ve been talking for half an hour. It’s all true what I said. Anyways… Let’s have a coffee. Will you also have a coffee? - If it’s no trouble. - Oh dear, I nearly forgot. Would you do a photo for me, for a form I have to fill in? Will you, Mr Bahenský? That wouldn’t really work very well. This is reportage photography. What you’d need is more a portrait. - Did you bake this yourself, Eva? - Oh no, it’s my mother’s baking. Do you think I can cook? I’ve never had time to learn. But maybe one day I shall. Photography must also be interesting work. Yes, it is. But of course if you’re doing it all the time you get fed up with it. I admire how much you all can withstand. That’s not quite it. It’s not as simple as it looks, you know. The other interests and plans I’ve had, I’ve had to give away. Hold it, Olda! Today to be at the top in sport means to sacrifice everything. Look into the lens! Come nearer, Olda, will you? I’ve no time for anything. Happier; happy, smile! I’m so tired. Always the same thing and sometimes I feel that I can’t go on. Well then, why don’t you give it up? You see, you can do it if you try. I’ll knock a tooth out! It happens sometimes, you must be careful. Bend deeper, more flexibility. Turn out your knees. On your toes. Heels forward. Sharper attack, accent on the up movement. Like a rubber. Up. Heels. Not so deep. Your weight on your little toes. Two, three, four… Turn around. Battement jeté. Better rond de jambe. Turn your knee out, heel forward. And développé bring it up. Bring it up, a little higher. And now grab your leg from the inside. It’s like on the beam, balance. Shoulders down. Turn your heel and stand. Kiss me. Kiss me! What do I get for it? What are you talking about? What will you give me for a kiss? Waiter, a shot of vodka! My God! Is it even possible for me to do this? I choose the direction, and then I start. I do two turns. Hands up. Turn the head. Good. Jirka! Jirka, wait, stop it! Jirka! Jirka! Now you need to do a proper pirouette. Nice and high… Okay? Twist. How many times have I told you? Hold your head. Take a direction. And then jump. Hold your head. Watch me. One-two, one-two. It should be like that. What are you doing tomorrow? Tomorrow I simply haven’t a minute. You always say the same thing. Before you used to manage it. So what do you think? To be here… you think it didn’t take any managing? I wouldn’t be here if I hadn’t. It’s terrible, I’m always managing something and it’s always the same. Only now I’ve got more work. Don’t get angry. Vera. I really love you. I’m not angry. I’m just sorry that I was mistaken about you. Sorry that we don’t understand each other. Tell me right now: are we going to train or loaf about? Don’t whine. You know, you’re not far from thirty, my girl. It doesn’t add to your suppleness. Stand up. Stretch it nicely to the other side. Nice and round. Stretch your vertebras. To the other side, even lower. Back parallel to the floor, we’ll flatten you out nicely like an ironing board. - Flat on your ear! - What are you doing with my hair? Jump. Long legs, up and jump! Good. Now we’ll do it without the safety belt. - Come on and let’s have a go at it! - Can I do another back handspring? You’ve done enough back handsprings in your life. Today we’re doing a salto. - Just one. - We’ve no time to waste. Get up. Get up! Legs like fiddle strings, jump! What are you doing again? It’s a salto we want, isn’t it? For goodness sake, just back off and go away. I need to be alone. Who’s going to look at this every day. You speak to her if she’s gonna be so… If I may say something to you both. I don’t know if she’s gonna jump, but you two’ll soon be jumping at each other. - Come and try it. - Alright, both of you, leave! A husband shouldn’t coach his wife! You have to manage to do this today, you simply have to do it. We’ve been practicing for it a half a year, and with a safety belt you do it perfectly. It only takes a little nerve. Get ready. And be perfectly calm. Now ready. Legs taut, up with it! Damnit, you’ve messed it up again! Stop with this “nerves” business, because you have no choice but to do it! - But I’m afraid. - What the devil are you afraid of? You can do a flying forward roll, without the safety belt perfectly, - and it’s a somersault, too. - Yes but it’s a front somersault. - So, what’s the difference? - A salto is a back somersault though. A salto is backwards… I can’t put eyes in the back of your head just for this! - But it’s like a leap in the dark. - Cut it out. Every sniveling kid in the circus does saltos on a daily basis, and if they didn’t, their Dad would take them out back and slap them. Go ahead, slap me then! It wouldn’t be such a bad idea. It’s not official teaching practice, but we could give it a go. - But you’d knock my head off. - Alright, agreed! - Agreed! It’s not my head that’s in danger. It depends on you. Come on. - You see. - Good lord, Eva, is it such a problem? There, you see. And one more to warm up. Is there anything in it? I’m really fed up. Right, go one more time! And the bet is on. Just go and stop thinking so much about it! Take off, focus on your direction. Right, go one more time! Don’t think about it, just go! Get ready. Concentrate. Come on. Sharp! Turn! Good girl! Now everything will go all right. Now let’s do it together. What now, an Arabian? Together, jump. And straddle jump. One more. Splendid. - A straddle jump. - Me? So I bust in my mouth? Just like it’s the circus… Our little Annie hasn’t a bone in her body, hurrah. Who is he? Do you know him? Me? No, where would I know him from? Let’s go! Why, I’m still thirsty. Let’s go! You think it’s fun to laugh at my fondness for you! You make me look silly in front of some idiot! If you only knew how silly you look! No lady would act that way, I can tell you that. And stop laughing. Stop laughing, Vera! You really have some nerve. I’m a married woman remember! I’m free to do as I like, understand? My only duty is towards my family. Vera! Vera! Vera! Well? It’s as if it you were rolling out the barrels, as if a wasp had stung you! It’s no use like that. One half hip circle, with the swing onto your feet, one front roll onto pointe, and if you can manage it, a run up and end up with a straddle leap. Good and join it up. Straddle leap and finish! - What on earth were you doing there? - A pirouette. This is not ballet school, but sports gymnastics. - Do you know what that looks like? - Don’t get excited! Now it’s a dynamic performance. Now ballet like in the National Theatre. And combined, the result is sport gymnastics. You think that? That’s crazy, you can’t do it like that. Once we’ve given it the character of an sports discipline, we must keep it up. For instance the straddle leap and straight into the jump. - Not bad. - Try it now. Down and back! Down and back! Down, and stay down! - What’s wrong now? - Your body orientation is bad. - I always do it like that. - That is why it’s so wrong. Now do the fouetté, but not like a dog at a corner stone! How am I to turn? You must turn not in relation to surrounding space, but in relation to your own body axis. - For the sake of esthetic effect. - Come and correct me. Now do the fouetté. But not like a dog at a corner-stone. Do a proper fouetté. Now pull back your left shoulder. Further back! And look over your shoulder. Don’t bend your head, or you’ll have a neck like a St. Bernard. Fully extended. Still more of a stretch, look this way. Press your hips forward and now reaching should reach out into space. That’s the idea. Now link it up with the leap. Jump… and pose. - Stop! - Hang on, what’s wrong now? - You’ve got to look at your pointe. You’re dancing as if it’s an old-fashioned barn dance. Come on, once more. Ready. Stop! Your arms are like a windmill. We saw how it should look. You have to combine them into one composition. Once more. Stop! The salto can’t be faked, it’s no use. - Once more. - I’m terrible tired. Let me rest a while. - Just a little while. - No, now you’re in practice mode. Get on with it! Up you get, Eva! Look what’s the use of sitting here. Get up! How did it come off? How does it look now? See how it goes uphill? Some speed, huh? The sausages you ordered. I’m not hungry. - You really don’t want anything? - I’m not hungry. - Red wine? - No, some coffee, thank you. What did you say is wrong with you again? It’s no fun with Mummy. What are you saying? You’ve no sense. Somebody might see us here. People can go to hell! A train’s just come in. Nobody will pay any attention to us there. The first display will be from Master of Sport, Eva Bosáková, of Czechoslovakia. I wanted to tell you before, Vera. Only I thought that it was something I’d get over. That it would solve itself. World champion on the bar and medal winner, Eva Bosáková. It’s simply a situation that has become intolerable. We must find a solution. You see things too bleakly. Don’t be afraid. I’ve already made up my mind. You know about Marta? Vera, I swear she didn’t really interest me. It was more chance. Coincidence. We were together and then we began to go on dates. Vera, you know, I was faithful to you all my life. But now I can’t break it off, and it can’t go on this way either. - We need to divorce. - No, it’s not true. It can’t be true, I hate you! No, you can’t do this to me! I’ll kill you…! I’ll ruin you! Leave me! I hate you! You can’t do this to us; to me, to him, to us both. No! I beg you! For his sake, your sake, I beg you. For God’s sake, no! Don’t think any more about it now. Be glad you’ve got it over with. At last, you’ll do what you want to. I know.
