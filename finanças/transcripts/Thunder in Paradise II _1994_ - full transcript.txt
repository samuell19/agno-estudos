Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment Man: I've had this dream at least a dozen times before. I'm walking in the desert. I'm walking in the desert and there's no sky above me. Imagine...no sky. And I think this dream is really about you. Or maybe it's about me. And I wonder if we're really ready for all of this. All this mystery. In retrospect, I'm not sure what all this time will be. Probably a long time ago. But we hang on to it. Maybe it just seems longer. Cause I've had this dream at least a dozen times before. I'm walking through the desert. I'm walking in the desert, and there's no sky above me. Imagine...no sky. And I think this dream is really about you. Or maybe...About me. And I wonder if you're really ready for all this. All this mystery. In retrospect, I'm not sure when all this started. Probably a long time ago. Or maybe not. Maybe it just seems longer. 'Cause I've had this dream at least a dozen times before. How much longer, trelawny? We're almost there, little one. Thank goodness for that. Come on. Ah, here it is, ladies. The dream hollow. Look at these flowers. Yes. And this is a trumpet vine. It's as strong as your soul, and twice as virtuous. Here, I'll make you a crown. Ah, the dream crown. You know, this is old as all of creation. Some say god put one upon his head, dreamed the universe, and here we stand. Here, Kelly. Put it on. Stand upon the rock. I don't know, trelawny. I don't even wear birthday hats because they feel so ridiculous. They're so silly, you know? Kelly daughter, were you not the one that wanted to have your dreams fulfilled? You came to me with tales of woe of your love life. Come on, Kelly. It'll be fun. I'll join you. Yes. Come. I'll make one for you, little one. Ok. Here. Climb the rock, put it on your head, and turn to face the west. Where the sun finds its slumber. I just wish dad and uncle bru were here. I'm sure they have some dreams that need to be fulfilled. Could you imagine your dad in one of these? [Both giggle] I didn't think so. Come now, come now. Face the sun. Look up. Close your eyes and let the dream take over. Come dream, come slumber. [Speaking in foreign dialect] Don't peek, Jessie. Come dream. Come slumber. [Speaking in foreign dialect] Dream... Come dream... [People scream] Thunder, activate remote guidance. Computer: Remote guidance activating. Let's go! This way, Princess. Strap yourself in. Computer: Battle shield activated. Cloaking. Shielding deployed. Fire! All hell's breaking loose out there. We're not out of the water yet, bro. They're giving US incoming from the east. Not for long. Computer, this is bru 1327. Interface aggressive tactical weaponry on forward view screen. Scanning. Don't like the way they're treating our scarab. I think it's time to give them a lesson in manners. Got it, bro. Fire! Fire! Warning! Warning! He's triangulating his targets. A few good shots, and we'll be roast duck, man. Don't get out the orange sauce just yet, I've almost got a lock on Elmer Fudd out there. Target locked. Let's revoke his hunting license. Load 3 sidewinders for locked target. Port two only operative. Damage to all other missile ports. Damn! That last blast took out all but one Maverick missile port. Fire! Show me lock and ready target for port one Maverick missile. Testing target. Computer override. Tactical modification. What are you doing? Aim for the gunner, not the ammo bunker. Modified target locked. You want to hit the sniper? We're running out of lucky shots. Well, don't look at me. Thunder's locked onto the ammunition bunker instead of the man with the fire power. I got only one silver bullet here, brother. I'm overriding. What? Manual launch. Override. Do it, man. Trust me. Manual launch override! Manual override. Re-targeting. Manual launch. 6 clicks right. Fire! Target neutralized. See, sometimes the old bruster knows best. Threat detection. New weapon locking on target. What the hell is that? Warning. target lock thunder. Where the hell did that come from? Oh, god. Oh, my god! Special tactics terminated. Destruction inevitable. Oh, my god! Daddy! [Running footsteps approaching] What is it, honey? Did you have a bad dream? No. I was just... Thirsty. I wanted some water. That was one heck of a holler for just a glass of water. Sure you don't want to talk about it? I told you, dad, it's nothing. You can go to bed. Ok? Where did this come from? Just something trelawny gave me. I should've known. I'm gonna have to have a little talk with trelawny first thing tomorrow. Now go back to bed and forget all this baloney, ok? I'll try. Just hope Kelly's sharing a dream tonight and not a nightmare. I love you. I love you, too, dad. Yo. Every man's soul knows perfect love. His life is a quest to find it. My quest has ended here. With you. And mine with you. [Bomb explodes] [Bomb explodes] [Bell rings] [Bomb explodes] Hurry. Father, what's happening? Mortador. [Women scream] You. What are you doing here? Leave US at once! I will not stand by-- you will stand by and watch your entire kingdom crumble! Unless you find a way to show me the respect I deserve! You're a barbarian! You cannot be trusted. Perhaps not. But he also possesses an arsenal of artillery cannons hidden somewhere in the desert. Cannons that he has proved, and all too dramatically, can destroy US in a matter of hours. Today's bombardment was only a warning. Son, your future as heir to my throne is at stake. What could be more important that it steals your attention? The answer. And where is this answer? In your white castle, father. On a beach. Here you go. Have a good day. You look like the dream crown gave you much to think about, sister. Perhaps you share a dream with a newfound soul mate? Just for a minute. Just when it started getting interesting, whoosh. It went away. You say the dream never finished? This is not good. Be careful. Truth takes some dangerous curves when it can't see its own tail. Ooh, baby. There is nothing wrong with this dream's tail. [Laughing] Watch out, trelawny. Storm's coming. Your hocus pocus dream stuff is history, trelawny. Got it? Jessica was up all night with nightmares. Whoa. Chill, my man. You know the dream crown is powerful medicine. If it bring nightmares, you should listen to their story. It scared her so much, she won't even talk about it. Every man's soul knows perfect love. His life is a quest to find it. My quest has ended here. With you. And mine with you. What's going on? My name is prince aramour, and in my country, a shared dream is as common as the sunrise. Kismet. Of all the corny... Hey, yo. Sheik dude! I've heard some lines in my time, but that one takes the moosaka. Ok, that's it! Flag on the play! Ooh, hello. No! No! Spence, bru, it's not what you think. It's not, huh? No. Well, when perfect strangers invade my beach with ginzu knives and hot tempers, I get a little testy. He is perfect, but he's not a stranger. I can't explain it, ok? I know how it would sound to you two. But you gotta let it go. Trust me. Please. They've shared a dream, me boys. It's as a told you, the dream crown is powerful medicine. ♪ I will try to understand ♪ ♪ how you came to rescue me ♪ ♪ a trip to never neverland ♪ ♪ on the wings of destiny ♪ ♪ to play as I'm dreamin' ♪ ♪ I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin' ♪ ♪ I found the place I want to stay ♪ ♪ don't wake me if I'm dreamin' ♪ ♪ I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin' ♪ ♪ if I die ♪ ♪ I'll dream away ♪ ♪ distant stars shine in your eyes ♪ ♪ distant stars shine in your eyes ♪ ♪ the burning flame of mystery ♪ ♪ and nothing can be denied ♪ ♪ nothing can be denied ♪ ♪ then ask for all eternity ♪ ♪ don't wake me if I'm dreamin' ♪ ♪ I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin' ♪ ♪ I found a place I want to stay... ♪ Is there anything wrong?

Hands that won't let me fall. It is customary in your country to invite one up for coffee. No disrespect to this beautiful land, but... Northern tandanasia coffee has the sweet taste of moonlight. Come with me, my darling. Tomorrow. Taste the moonlight. I just need a minute, ok? Of course. Come on, guys. I'm not going off to war. It's just an adventure. I'll be back. Your heart set on this? My heart. Yeah. Good choice of words. That's a communicator. Listen to me. If anything happens to you, you call US, and we'll be there. Ok? Ok. I'm gonna miss you. Thanks, bru. Think with your head not only your heart. You guys are such romantics, aren't you? Come here. Give me a hug. Come on, Jess. [Using adding machine] Jess, it's 2 in the morning. What are you doing? I figured it out. I've already slept 32,177 hours. So you see, dad, I've slept more than enough for one lifetime. You really don't want to have that dream again, do you? I'm just not tired anymore. Well, you may not be tired, but I am. Come on, champ. Alley oop. Good night, and I love you. Now go to sleep. What holiday is this? You. You are the holiday. They celebrate your arrival. They do this with all the girls you bring home to meet the folks? Actually, you are the first. So, I guess this is what they mean by the royal treatment. Daddy! Uncle bru! Daddy! Dad, I'm glad you're here. I'm so scared. Honey, what's wrong? My dream. It was like in Aladdin. Except for these were real, live people. You were both rescuing a woman. Racing over roof tops, jumping on roofs and flag Poles. And bru, he found a flying carpet with a tiger on it, and you jumped off a tower with it, and flew away. Dreams aren't for real, honey. And it doesn't sound like anything to be afraid of. It gets scarier. You got the woman on thunder, but uncle bru made a big mistake. Well, now we know it's not real because I don't make mistakes. Actually, I did make a mistake once. It was April of '73. I asked Linda tinto to be my Valentine. She was a second degree black belt, I was ambitious-- there was this big gun firing at you. And the computer wanted you to shoot at a building, but you only had one bullet left, so you changed what the computer wanted, and...and it made you blow up. Well, dream's all gone now. It's out in the open. So let's go back to bed. And if you close your eyes, uncle bru and I will stay here till you fall asleep and give you one of our super deluxe back scratches. And everything's gonna be ok. Oh, sorry. You really don't have to do that. Thanks. I'm really ok. You don't have to fan me. Thanks. [Knock on door] Come in. Oh. Prince aramour. Please. Accept this humble gift as a small token of appreciation of your visit. I love gifts. [Girls gasp] I--it's beautiful. I can't accept this. Oh, but you must. It's traditional. All the women in this country wear this kind of dress. On their wedding day. Boy, you princes waste no time, do you? That's because there is no time to waste. The destiny of my kingdom is hanging in the balance. Kelly... You and I, we... We shared a dream. And that dream gave me the answer to save my homeland. [Footsteps] Get out of my way! What is going on here? Who is he? This is most difficult. The pain in my heart strikes me deep like a dagger. But allow me to explain. In order to prove my allegiance to the war lord mortador, I must sacrifice my most valuable treasure. And what greater sacrifice can there be than to give up my dream. My treasure. My kismet. Hold on. I am nobody's treasure. I beg to differ. You will marry mortador. Tomorrow. This too is kismet. The hell it is. Bru! Spence! Help me, I'm in trouble! Give me that! Ow! [Snoring] [Sniffs] Oh! [Beeping] [Beeping continues] [Beeper] [Beeping] Thunder: Transmission received. Kelly: Bru, Spence, help me! I'm in trouble! Mortador: Give me that! That was Kelly. She's in trouble. Wake trelawny up. Tell her she's got to stay with Jess. Wait. If Kelly's in trouble, that means the woman in my dream was her, and if you go, you'll blow up in thunder. I know it. You can't go. I won't let you. It's ok, Jess. Don't worry. We have to help Kelly. What you had was a dream. And dreams change all the time. Bru: Trelawny will meet US at the beach in the morning. Hey, boys. Here. I made you some nourishment for your trip. It will give you strength and wisdom. Hey, trelawny, what's that? That's me hot sauce. It'll save you many a trouble. Ah, yeah. Well, I heard the food was plenty bland there. Wait, dad. I'm coming with you. Jess, you know you can't come with US. But I can help you. But you don't know about the water wheel or the nets, or you probably forgot all about the flying carpet with the tiger's face on it. Honey, look, tell US what else you saw in your dream, bru will remember it, and we'll watch out for it. Ok. Besides the flying carpet, you were trapped in a small room with sparks all around. Then you used trelawny's hot sauce on your food and there was a water wheel, and you ran across roof tops into a camel. You can't do this. I've got a life back home. You can't just take that away from me. What about our dream? This is the dream. It just ended suddenly. It ended with a barrage of artillery fire from mortador's army. It was then I realized that to give you up to him was to save my country. There's got to be another way. This is the only way. [Bell rings] My god. The dream crown. Dreams don't change. Prepare her for the ceremony. Don't touch me. Please! Guards! Unhand me! Kelly! [Screams] No! Ow! [Screams] [Continues screaming] No! As I said... Prepare her for the ceremony. Shielding deployed. I sure wish Kelly would've dreamed about a prince who lived a lot closer. Like clearwater beach, Florida. You're right bro, even at hyper speed, it's still gonna be another...2 hours. What's in the fridge? Food. Yeah. I'm in a creative mood. Let's see what I can whip up. Double meat whopper all the way with cheese, heavy on the onions sure would be nice. Spence, you gotta feed the body as well as the spirit. Ok, then I'll have fries with that. You know what, how about a nice filet mignon ala rosini, huh, huh? Or perhaps even au naturel with a little flambè for flair. And to get US in the mood for the northern tandanasian coast, fromage du goat. Bru... It's 8 A.M. in northern tandanasia. I think maybe a couple breakfast buddies would be more appropriate. Oh, man. What is it? I don't believe it. The inventory. Oh, man! One frozen burrito and a can of cream of mushroom soup. Sounds great. Add an ice cold squirt, and I'll be in hog heaven. Wait. Ah! Ha ha! Eh voila! Oh, wow. Trelawny's care package. What did she pack in there? You a leg or a breast man? That all depends on what it's attached to. A lot of hot sauce. Hit me with one of those chicken breasts. You ever tried this stuff before? Hold that stuff. Tried it one time. It took me two weeks to get my tongue back. Think I'll pass on it. Hey, Spence. About this Kelly, prince thing, you believe in love at first sight? Oh, yeah. Happened to me one time. Linda clurge. Body of a goddess. Hmm. Met her at the red onion in the valley. She was standing next to the taco bar. She had guacamole all over her face. It was love at first bite. Tell you what, best summer I ever had. Ever happen to you? Yeah. Sort of. Didn't turn out as good as yours. Wanda tricondanosis. Is that a girl or a foot disease? Now don't be cruel. Wanda tricondanosis. Very first girl I ever had a date with. An older woman. She was 8, I was 6. We went to the moon gate. Best Chinese in town. She had a Shirley temple, I had a Roy Rogers. Night was young. Anything was possible. Then the waiter put all the food in the middle of the table. My little arms were too short to reach it. Waiter had to come back every time I wanted another egg roll. Most humiliating moment of my life. Sad story, bru. Still haven't gotten over it. Warning! detecting oppressive tactical weaponry on sonar. Guidance trap door spider missile with a command destruct signal locked on our thrusters, brother. Impact in 11 seconds. Stop all engines. Rig systems for silent running. Lock on traces and straddle firing. Straddle firing lock engaged. 6 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2... Fire! Good shooting, man. Thunder, switch to deep sonar and scan for additional trap door missiles. Negative on image sighting. Agog penetration grid shows no data on additional launch flight coordinates. Oh, great! We're in the middle of a minefield, we don't even know where they are. No way northern tandanasia could deploy trap door technology. The Soviets could. 5 years ago. Exactly. During the conflict to protect tandanasian waters. The missiles are buried 20 feet beneath the ocean floor. They target engine vibration and unless they receive an abort code, they open their trap doors, and they launch, brother. Can we break the codes? Maybe in a day or two, but by then, Kelly could be doing the dance of the 7 veils. Well, we just can't sit here in silent running forever. Well, the only other way I can think of is for US to clear a safety corridor for ourselves. You don't mean US, you mean me. Hey, you got the easy job. All you gotta do is open the doors. I'm the one who's gotta shoot them down. [Chuckling] Hey, there's no blast until it's out of the water. They launch on compressed nitrogen. Ah! Spence. No dive gear. Vibrations. It's not my fault. I didn't put the missiles down there. Thunder, switch computer console to port controls. Ok, Spence sweep at full half-moon patterns. Launch sensors are about 10 feet from the trap doors themselves. Spence, pull back! You triggered one! [Alarm buzzing] And... Ha ha! Got one! Good teamwork, partner. Keep 'em comin'. Don't worry, bro. If they're down here, I'll flush 'em out for you. [Alarm buzzing] [Alarm buzzing] Hey, bro, I think we've just come up with a new action sport. [Alarm buzzing] All right, Spence, thunder calculates only one more missile before we reach the perimeter. Sorry to hear that. I'm gettin' real, real good at this. Spence! Spence, abort! The trap door isn't opening! The missile's gonna explode on impact! [Hydraulics on door whirring] Spence, get out of there! [Grunting] Spence! Spence! Spence, can you hear me? Spence! Computer: Diver in. You ok, man? Not really. Can't believe you didn't bring any of those leftover French fries with US. [Laughing] I tell you what. I'll mold up some soy meal and season it. You'll never know the difference. I will now. Good work. Good shooting. Ok, I'll admit it. Admit what? You had the tougher job. Let's go get Kelly. R.o.c. For hyper-speed? On my Mark. Hyper-speed routine of command activated. 4, 3, 2, 1. Mm-hmm. So that's what northern tandanasia looks like. What do you think, bro? By the water wheel's the best bet. Water wheel? Wasn't there something about a water wheel in Jess's dream? Coincidence. I'm gonna get the equipment together before we go ashore. Don't forget the ropes and the grappling gear. Got it. Whoa! Look at that, man! No! I wonder what that son of a bialy is doin' to her? Doesn't look much like kismet to me. More like a machine gun wedding. Let's boogie. You got it, bro. No! Let go of me! Ow! Let go of me! No! Agh! Aw, well, don't sweat it, guys. We're on the bride's side. Ow! Bru: Hey, hey, hey! Spence: Hey! Stop it! Inside now! Quickly! Quickly now! Be polite! [Guard shouting command] [Door locking] Hey! Hey, yo, sport! How about a phone ca--aah! Surprise! We do have electricity. [Laughing] Ohh. Bru! Bru! Bru! Oh, god. Bru! Bru! What, what, what, what? What? Ow! Bru, you ok? Ohh! Ok's not exactly the word I would use. How about 20,000 volts? Oh, man. Major headache. You got any aspirin? Tylenol. Spence, bru... God, where are you? I'm now going to read silently from the ceremonial book of northern tandanasia. What time is it? [Laughing] Spence, that's the third time you've done that to me, ok? The bit's getting a little bit old. [Yawn, sigh] Well, the good news is, these weddings, they can take hours. Everybody's got to sit around, listen to the officiate while he reads from the ceremonial book, bada yada. Kind of like a superstition or something, huh? Well, they figure the longer the ceremony lasts, the longer the wedding'll last, hmm? Ah! Mmm! Very nice. Hey, get away from there! Away, away! Hmm! Hey! Yo, sports fan! Sports fan? You sure you want to do that? I don't like noise when I eat. He doesn't like noise when he eats. Ok, hey, hey, it's none of our business. I imagine they've all been inoculated for tricondanosis anyways, wouldn't you think? Hmm. Makes sense in these neck of the woods. Yeah. Enjoy. Uh, what is this tricondano-- tri--what you said? Tricondanosis? Yeah. You've never heard-- you know what? I'll bet you they have a different name for it here. Yeah, it's pretty rare back home. Yeah. Tricondanosis is small, uh... Parasite? No, it's a animal, actually. It's an animal? It grows in hot, dry, Sandy places. Aha, yeah, especially around camels. Loves camels. Yeah, lays its eggs in certain foods. Lamb... Rice, uh, stuff like that. I don't think they need to worry, do they? No, I don't think it pertains to this area. Well, he's the expert. You know, his brother came down with a bout of it in Iran. Was a horrible story. What happened? Oh, I don't want to talk about it. Tell me! Tell me! He said he doesn't want to talk about it. Tell me! Oh, all right. Ok, the animal lays its eggs in the food, you eat the food, the food goes into your stomach, the eggs hatch in your stomach, and, uh... Ever seen the movie alien? Agh! Oh! Oh, oh, now, it's an awful shame to waste good food like that, especially when there's a simple test to see if there's anything in there. What test? Well, that's not my job description, now, is it? I'm a prisoner of war, not a health inspector. Tell me now, or you'll be missing in action! [Whispering] Ok. Ok. Stand back from the door! Ok, let's have a look-see. Uh... You're in my light. Psst. Psst, psst! Voilà. Ha ha ha! Trelawny's hot sauce. A lovely year. A dup dup doo... Voilà. Mm. Shall we? Ok, everything looks kosher. Have a nice lunch. Aah! Agh! [Coughing] After you. Thank you. Sorry, man. We're on a mission. Nothing's gonna stop US. Come on, bru. Let's save a friend. You got it, man. Let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Hurry up! Let the wedding begin. We are brought here together under the glorious eyes of the sun to witness... ...in order that he can place his hand... ...to show our allegiance to the great warrior, mortador, my son, prince aramour, has surrendered his greatest gift, the gift of the destiny of love. Today, I shall officiate at mortador's marriage to my son's love. [Women screaming] Drop it! Drop it now! I mean it! Ok! If there's anyone among US who feels that these two people should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak up now! Stay where you are. This is my battle! Cha! Aah! Aah! Bru: Get him, Spence! Come on, man! Aah! Oh! Agh! Ohh! Yah! Yah! Ohh! Spence: Oh, yeah! Surrender! Surrender or die! I surrender. Good choice. Hey, legs, how'd you like to go home? Boy, would I like that. Let's go, honey. No one has ever defeated mortador. He described your conflict as a battle, and as tradition dictates, if he surrenders in battle, he concedes power. The wedding is off! Meet our new warlord. [Shouting, firing weapons in the air] Wait a minute! And I can marry my dream. Now wait a minute! [Cocks weapon] [Cocking weapons] Now, wait a minute! [Musician playing stringed instrument] What a peaceful scuttlebutt. You know, Spence, I have renewed respect for you. I never thought you'd like fatwan. I'm hungry, and it's good. What is it? Baked bat lips. Not bad. Too much fennel. Don't see how we're gonna get Kelly past these guards. We'll work on it. [Musician stops playing] A toast. To our newfound friends. Father. There is no reward I can give you for the gift you have given me for defeating mortador... [Shouting] And bringing me back my dream wife. There's one. Let Kelly go. Impossible. Fate cannot be changed. She will remain here for the rest of he life. However, there is one thing I want to give you. My daughter, Fatima, shall become your wife. [Claps] Careful, Spence. I've seen this in movies. Daughters of kings invariably look like dick butkus. Maybe we can make this work. Spence, wake up and smell the tabouli. This is not an option. [Sniffing] And for you, the thin one-- hey! I have decided to make you our grand naforiny. You will be in charge of all the ladies in waiting. You will bathe them, sleep with them, rule over them. They will obey your every wish and command. You know, maybe we're being a little bit rash here. I mean, we have to think about our future. The food's great. I'll bet they have a fantastic...

[Shouting] Let's go the long way! Aah! [Shouting] [Gunfire] What's happening here? Get on the rooftops. That's the only way out! Go! I'll meet you on top! Ha-tah! Go up the ladder! Whoa! Ooh! Aah! I said, unh! Hyah! Dead end. Dead end! Grab a handful, legs! Aah! Aah! Aah! Kelly: Hurry, Spence! [Shouting] Bru, behind you! Aah! Come on! Oh, you're kidding! Well, now where do we go? Down! Spencer, no! Aah! Aah! Ohh! Yah! Aah! Get up the ladder! Whoa! Hey, hey! Watch it! Hey!, steady! Thank you very, very-- watch out! Whoa-ho! Give me your hand! Come on! Thank you--whoa! Hey! Ok, this is gettin' old! Uh! No! Oh! Guys! Guys, could you work this out on your own, please? Kelly: Bru! Get off there! Come on! Come on! Ah-suh! Whoa-oh! Who's talkin' anger now? Yeah, well, you weren't almost made a grand naforiny. Hey! Listen, if we can find something to make a hand-hold out of, I think we got a way out of here. Trelawny's voice: And this is a trumpet vine. It's as strong as your soul and twice as virtuous. Use this! For what, a corsage? Trust me, it'll work. [Straining] It's strong stuff. It'll work. Let's go! Go for it. Grab this. Wait a minute! I didn't know this was for me! And don't look down! Have a fun trip, legs! Aah! Ok. We're gonna have to find another way out. Yeah. Spence. Ah ha ha ha! Am I a genius, or what? Look, look! A tiger! Don't you remember? Jessica's dream. Everything she told US has come true so far. She said we were gonna escape on a flying carpet. Bru, you're about 50 bullets short of an assault rifle. You're trying to tell me we're gonna fly out of here on a magic carpet? What do I look, crazy? No, no! But there's a substantial updraft comin' off the street there. We use it like a hang glider. You ever tried this out before? Spence, who's got time? And this is definitely one of those things that you don't try at home. But we don't have a lot of options now, do we? What's the worst thing that could happen? We plummet 200 feet to our death. Oh, hell, if you put it that way. Let's do it. Ohh! Ohh! Aah! Aah! Oh, my god! You guys ok? That's the last time I listen to you! Well, the idea seemed structurally sound! Kelly: Come on, guys! Please, Kelly. Don't run. You're free now. Come with me. We can finally taste the moonlight. Taste this, you royal wimp! Ah! Oh! Thunder's activated. She's waitin'. Let's go! Let's go! My hand, Spence! My hand! [Gunfire] Kelly: Oh! Don't these guys ever give up? Oh! Get him, Spence! Ooh! Aah! Aah! Oh, no! Aah! Let's go! Computer: Battle shield activated. Cloaking. Fire! Strap yourself in, Kelly. I got it. Fire! All hell's breakin' loose out there. You ok, legs? I'm ok. Just get US out of here. Right! We're not out of the water yet. We've got incoming from the east. Not for long. Computer, this is bru 1327. Interface aggressive tactical weaponry on forward view screen. Fire! Scanning for enemy weaponry on tactical target. Weapons position locked. Showing two insurgency threats. Whoa, man! This is just like Jess's dream! Show me lock-in. Ready target for port one Maverick missile. Fire! Computer: Adjusting target, computer override. Technical modification. Bru: You're crazy! How could shooting out an ammo bunker take out an artillery Cannon half a mile away? I don't know, bru, but if you take out the hornets' nest, like in Jess's dream, we get aced! Don't you get started! All right, what would you do? Like I told Jess, you can change a dream. [Machine gun firing] Fire! Rrr! Gimme computer override! I'm doin' a manual launch! What?! Give me computer override! I'm gonna launch manually! Trust me, man! Computer: Manual override. Re-targeting. Manual lock on my Mark. 6 clicks right. Modified target locked. Fire! Fire! 3...2... Abort that! Abort that! Give me computer launch! Computer launch on my Mark! Fire when secured! Target locked. Ignition of underground fuel line. Aah! Aah! Total destruction of multiple weaponry. Get out! Get out! [Shouting] Computer: Targets neutralized. Yeah, ha ha! Yes! Yes, indeed! Yes, man! Indeed! Indeed! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Ooh-whee! Any way you guys could do hyper-speed? I can't wait to get home. Sounds good to me, mon frère. Starting r.O.C. For hyper-speed. Routine of command for hyper-speed activated. Turbo-thrusters at full load. Hyper-speed initiated. Little one, look, you're lost in the swamp. Now, if you'd been paying attention, you could have entered the rodeo at Cheyenne. I've still got lots of chances to make the national finals. Not as many as you think. Remember, we're playing championship rodeo, not monopoly. Jessie, pay attention. I am. What time is it? Much too late to be up. Daddy! Ha ha! Daddy, I was so worried. Well, dreams change, Jess, sometimes for the better. Especially thanks to your information. [Kissing] You mean, all that stuff I told you came true? You flew on a magic carpet? Well, we took a little trip on one. Trelawny: You look as if you've been on a bit of a trip yourself, sister. Well, it would have been a bigger crash if it wasn't for your dream crown. Ah, the dream crown. I told ya, strong medicine. Well, you look beautiful. Did you get married? No. What I got, though, was an education. Look, I know I caused you guys a lot of trouble, so tomorrow, scuttlebutt, drinks on me, for my heroes. Sounds great, legs, but, um, I'm gonna have to get a little sleep tonight. I've got boat-lag. Now, come on, Jess. Let's get down and see who's gonna win this here rodeo. Moo! Yee-ha! Hey, wait a minute. Give me a hug. Sweetie. Here we go. Here we go. All right, all right. Ooh, this should be just about enough money to put a new paint job on thunder. [Music playing, people chatting] Here ya go. Thanks. Ok. I don't blame the guys for not coming. I kind of really messed up. Kelly, don't fold your cards so quickly on your dreams, sister. They're foxy little devils. They'll sneak up on you from behind and pinch you when you least expect it. Hey, hey, ladies! Ladies, ladies, ladies! How about a bru special, heavy on the umbrellas. Use that fake, uh, goblet thing. If I can remember where I left it. 2 iced teas, and light on the sugar. Anything for my heroes. You guys. I guess it's kismet that you're here with US. I don't think it's kismet. I think it's paradise. I'll drink to that. Yo ho! A toast to the greatest set of gams on the beach. Good to have you back, honey. Hey!
