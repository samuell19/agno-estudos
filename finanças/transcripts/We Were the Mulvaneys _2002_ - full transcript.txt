What's the matter? Don't you recognize your older brother? You look sort of different. That's my intention. I brought what you wanted. So give it to me. What exactly are you gonna do? The less you know, the less you're involved. Did you bring those, uh... They go in this end, and they come out that end. I almost forgot. You having doubts? No. Look... whatever you want, I'll do it. If you want me to pull the trigger myself, I'll do it. Look... I'll meet you here when it's over. Patrick! It all happened so fast. I had become an accomplice to my brother Patrick's premeditated crime. I love you. I have to make an attempt to understand what happened. What brought me to take a gun from my father's cabinet? What brought Patrick, the brother I love more than god, to embark on kidnapping, grand theft, and murder? But this isn't a confession. Not at all. I've come to think of it as a family album. The kind my mother never kept. Absolute truth telling... The kind no one's mom keeps. But if you've been a child in any family, you've been keeping such an album in memory, in conjecture, and yearning. It's a life's work. And it may be the great and only work of your life. We were the mulvaneys of high point farm, storybook people in a storybook house. We were once the perfect dream. For a long time you envied US. Then you pitied US. Then you thought, "good. That's what they deserved." "Too direct, judd," my mother would say, wringing her hands in discomfort. But I believe in uttering the truth, even if it hurts. Particularly if it hurts. Baby. I had a call from from Marion madsen. She wanted to know if I had any antique clocks. I hope you told her we got a clock epidemic. Oh, yeah, that from somebody who's notoriously late. Muffin, captain mulvaney is always on time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good morning. Honey, sit down. Don't use too much of that syrup. It's pure maple. It's very expensive. I don't have time to eat. Ah! Breakfast is... The most important meal of the day. Have a little bit of orange juice. Tell me, muffin, why do you suppose a certain football hero here hasn't done his chores for over a week? Tell him, "I'm sorry, sir. I'm just a little behind. I got to get my jeans. Oh, you could take the bus. Hey, you take a shower. You're soaking wet. Your old man loves you, number four! See you later, suckers! Mike! Mike! Mike! Jerk! Memory blurs. That's the point. If memory didn't blur, we wouldn't have the fool's courage to do things again, again, and again that tear you apart like labor. My mother had four children. Marianne was the miracle baby. You only get one of them once if you're lucky. Mom said Jesus dwelled in marianne's heart since the day she was born. Who could argue with that? She not only was beautiful, she was absolutely radiant. She and my brother Patrick were bonded forever because they shared space in the womb. Boy, were they different. Marianne was one of the most popular girls in school, but Patrick was a self-declared loner. He disdained high school sports, clubs, and competition of popularity in whatever guise. His heroes were Galileo, Newton, Charles Darwin, and Albert Einstein. He couldn't imagine any of those people caring in the least about popularity. My dad was the disowned son of a working-class family in Pittsburgh. He set out at age 18 to make something of himself. He started mulvaney roofing out of nothing. He owned property, had money and influence, was known and liked and respected. My mom was the rock of Gibraltar, the eternal optimist. And having four kids was just part of the challenge somehow, like keeping an even course in a canoe on a wild, rushing river. We never let her rest. But when it came to business, dad called mom "a hopeless amateur." She sold antiques, but she only bought things she fell in love with. Naturally, things she fell in love with she couldn't bear to sell to strangers. Oh, that one! Oh, I'm... Gee, I'm awfully sorry. This has been requisitioned by a previous owner. I didn't tag it. Mikey, Jr., the oldest of the mulvaney kids, and my big brother. A real leader, a force, but stubborn. We called him "mule." Since I was the youngest, there had always been a kind of an alliance between US. In fact, I wanted to be just like him... A jock. Whoo! But I wasn't very athletic, so I picked a sport that didn't require too much talent. My true name is judson Andrew mulvaney. Judd for short. Dad liked to hint that I'd been named after a rich, eccentric relative of his... An Irish landowner, a lapsed catholic... But I guess that was some kind of joke. Dad hadn't any relatives at all in Ireland that he knew, nor any relatives in this country he'd acknowledge. Show me some teeth. We mulvaneys were a family in which everything that happened was precious. And everything that was precious was stored in memory, and everyone had a history. That is until the event when everything came apart for US. It was never again put back together in quite the same way. Amen. Amen. Amen. Tell them about your dress. Well, daddy took me to leanne's, this really neat shop in Rochester. We had so much fun. My mom's fun, too, but daddy has better taste. It's backless. Tell US! My mom nearly died. She doesn't think it's appropriate, of course, but thank god daddy always wins. Over a goose, for god's sake, in the middle of a goose pond! You're joking. No, I'm not kidding. I was walking with her around the lake... Oh, this was the summer I was a waitress in the adirondacks, and he was this gorgeous construction worker. All the girls were crazy about him. Will you let my tell this to Trish? We're walking along. There's this tremendous squawking noise, and we see a goose trapped in some fishing net. This one yells, "oh, look, that poor goose! We have to save it!" And she marches straight into that dirty brown water up to her waist to save the damn thing. There's geese and killer swans all over the place, and I followed her in in my good crepe-soled canvas shoes. That's how pretty she was. I always say... We fell in love over a goose. Anyway, the damn thing was flapping its wings like a deranged windmill. I finally get ahold of it, and "nature girl" here untangles that net just like unwrapping a gift on Christmas morning. And I'm looking at her, and I'm thinking, "now that girl is quick, and she's strong, and she's damn pretty." Oh, yeah. Don't believe him Trish. I was a fuzzy-haired, gawky, homely... Farm girl. Farm girl! Poor Trish comes over for dinner, and we stick here with out life story. I loved hearing it. It's even better the millionth time. Isn't that right, little muffin? Soon we'll be able to travel back in time and actually relive the goose story. Oh, don't listen to Mr. Einstein over there. Mike, where are you going? Got a date. Can't be late, right? 12:00 sharp, number four! Remember! Okay, okay, okay. Damn! Ohh! Ugh! Oh, turn it off. Turn it off. Oh, I'm wasted. Shhh! You're gonna wake up mom and dad. Come on, little buddy, let's piss the old man off, huh? "We mulvaneys must maintain our dignity. We are judged by different standards." Shh! You can't pull the wool over his eyes. You think it's easy, judd, huh? You think it's easy being Mike mulvaney, Jr.? Yeah, it must be real hard. Big man on campus. All the pretty girls cheering for you. Oh, god. I think I'm gonna puke. Please don't. Dad will have it bronzed. Wouldn't it be nice if we could just go home? Do I torture my family? Yes. Force them to eat like royalty at the country club? Honey, it's not the food. You know that. It's just those people. We are those people. Not those kind of people. We're not. Oh, come on, you like ray pringle. I do not. Well, he likes you. Maybe that's why he's recommending mulvaney roofing for the civic center job. Oh. Hi, dad. Ooh, the beef Wellington. Excellent. Hey, Zach, you're looking pretty spiffy there. Thank you. Mort, a big game coming up. Oh, nothing we can't handle. Michael, the roof's looking good. Maybe you could recommend a plumber. You know that leak downstairs... No problem, ray. I'll take care of it myself. A Jack-of-all-trades. Who are you taking to that dance anyway? Who knows? Gerry! How's Jeannette and the kids, judge? Everybody's well. Thank you, Michael. How are you, coralee? It's Corinne. I call her Mrs. Mulvaney. May I? Well, of course. ♪ Get away from it all oh, captain! Who do you think I am? Tell US your secret, Corinne. Oh, this man isn't my husband. We're just trying things out. Dr. Bethune's wife knows your name. She likes you. Everyone does. I don't know, captain. Then why did it take them five years to let US into their club? Well... Come on! We got them on the run! Get 'em, daddy! Oh, get it! Come on! Count to three. Okay. Here we go. Hut one, hut two, hut three, hike! Whoo! Way to go, button! Go, number four! Go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, number four, go! Touchdown! Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Let's go, guys. Don't you just love this? How did all this happen anyway? Oh, we're just lucky, sugar. And that one... I don't know. It's like god is trusting US with something we're probably not good enough to deserve. Hoo-hoo-hoo! Hike! We mulvaneys are joined at the heart. Catch it, Patrick! Hmm. Maybe we weren't perfect. Nothing is. But what we had was pretty damn good... A very solid foundation. No cracks, at least that we could see then. I'm gonna stick you. Where's the family photographer? Ranger, where are you? It's beautiful, Austin. My mother picked it up. Oh, it's wonderful. Ranger, where are you?! Come on, you guys. Let's not be late. Right here. Right in front of the fireplace. That's it. You look like a dream, darling. Daddy! Show me some teeth. Now one of you alone, button. Enough now! Come on, come on. Come on. You look beautiful in that dress. Peaches and cream. Picked it out myself, Austin. It's nice. You better believe it's nice.

Hey, I've got something here. Come on, try it. It's mild. Oh, I've tasted champagne before. I like it better than beer. You won't notice it. Oh. It's good. Really. Do you want to hear something? I can't get you out of my head. Come on, Zach. No, I'm serious. You don't think I can be serious. No one does. But there's the real me that somebody like you brings out. And then there's the other me... The jerk. You're not a jerk. It feels so good, you know, to be able to talk to somebody seriously. I feel so alone most of the time and depressed. Why? You have everything. God has truly blessed you, Zachary. Sometimes I wonder if god even exists, you know? Whether god gives a damn if we all live or die. Don't ever say that. There is a god, and he does care. Marianne... We got to leave. Oh. I have to be home... my curfew. Well, the party's not over. Well, I'm supposed to drop you off at Trish's. Yeah. No, I'll tell you what, Austin. It's on my way. I don't mind really. I don't know, Zachary. I mean... marianne? I can go with him if it's okay. Well, okay. Okay. Austin... I had a really nice time. Thank you so much. It's past his bedtime anyway. Don't worry. Don't be mean. I'm so dizzy. You're gonna be all right. Come on. Hey, Zach! Everything's going around Oh, wait. What? I don't feel good. Don't play games with me. I'm not playing games with you. I really don't feel so good. Come on. You like me, marianne, don't you? And I like you. Girls, come on down to breakfast! I'm not hungry! What happened last night? You just disappeared. Nothing. I mean, I don't really remember. I'm so tired. I looked for you everywhere. Austin weidman was wondering around like a chicken with his head cut off. Yeah, I know. Who brought you home? Hello? Mom, I'm sorry, but can someone come pick me up? Oh, sure, honey. Bye-bye. Pinch! Oh, honey, will you pick up marianne at the la portes? She needs a ride home. A morning drive to mt. Carman and back? Thanks, mom. That's just what I need. Take the Pontiac. Your dad's got the pickup. I got it. Suit yourself. It's fine. Okay, so what happened? Did Austin weidman spill punch on your new dress, and you're afraid to tell mom 'cause it cost 200 bucks? I got it. It's a boy-girl thing, right? Everything's about sex. It's the primary law of nature. There's nothing wrong. Oh, come on, marianne! You're incapable of deliberate deception. I know. Remember those chess lessons that one time? Pinch, please don't. I don't know why you're trying to hide it from me. I'm just gonna pick it up on twin radar. Ow! Marianne, look at me. I just have a headache, pinch. Just a headache. The harvest ball was a real bust, right? Right. I still haven't heard about our bid for the civic center. Well, as the condemned man said on the scaffold, "no noose is good noose." Mr. Pringle said he cleaned your clock in golf. Ray pringle? Give me a break. Let me tell you something. I can Bury ray pringle on the golf course anytime I want if I push hard. Zach, you're hurting me! Don't! Dill bread. Whistle, will you stop jumping up every five minutes? "A good equilibrium" in what sense? In the sense of friendship, pure and simple. Friendship with a person of ray pringle's quality means a hell of a lot more... It's sound business sense. Get with the program, pinch. Hmm, feathers... Who in this family had to set the table because the person who usually does didn't? I think it's cruel to keep that poor bird caged his entire life so that selfish human beings like US can be entertained. I think it's a sin! Button, feathers is a canary who was bred for generations for that cage. He loves that cage. He was born in it. It's a gorgeous cage... antique. It's still a cage. Marianne. Marianne! In a family, what isn't spoken is what you listen for. The noise of a family drowns it out. Because I was the last born of the mulvaney children, I was usually the last to know everything, good news or bad. And probably there were lots of things I never knew at all. We mulvaneys would have died for one another, but we had secrets from one another just the same. We still do. Corinne, hi! How are you? Well, I'm fine. Whoa, I'm busy. How come you make yourself so scarce at the club? We hardly see you? Priscilla says your daughter was really pretty at the harvest ball. Oh, yeah, she was. I hope you took photographs. Oh, yeah. How is your family? Well, the last time I looked they were fine. Oh, boy. I got to move it. Um, please, can I speak with you for a second? Let me tell you about your daughter. Yeah? What's the matter? Well, maybe it's none of my business, but I saw marianne at the 11:00 mass at the catholic church in bayberry. When? Today. No, that's impossible. She never misses a day of school. I know she left this morning... I saw her. And, well, I'd want to know if my daughter were, you know, skipping classes. Hmm. Well, thanks. Thanks, Lydia. That's really... I appreciate that. Bye. Secrets... It seemed like the world was crisscrossed with them like electromagnetic waves. Maybe even held together by them. And if you blunder into a secret, it's like you pushed open a door that you thought was just a wall. You can look through it, or if you're brave or reckless enough, you can step inside and take a chance that what you'll learn is worth what it costs. Button. Honey. It's just me, sweetheart. Let's go. Let's go. Boy, that was really some surprise to hear from Lydia bethune... I mean, I hardly know the woman... That you... that you'd skipped classes today and were hiding away at a catholic church of all places. Did you have a bad quarrel with a friend? Did something happen at the dance? Button? Don't you feel well, hmm? You want to see Dr. Oakley? No, mom. Well, what is it, honey? I just want to go home. I'm gonna be fine. Okay, we'll go home. Hey, I got some of that wonderful corn-chicken chowder that you love so much. Aaah! Honey! Aaaah! Aaaah! No! No! Stop, Zachary! Stop! Shut up! No, no, no! No, honey, it's okay. Stop, Zachary! Stop it! Damn it, marianne, you threw up in my dad's car! No! It's all right, sweetie! It's okay. It's okay. We didn't hit him. We didn't hit him. It's all right. It's okay. It's all right. Everybody's all right. No, no, no, no. Shh! Shh! Shh! It wasn't all his fault. I was... I was drinking. I'm sorry, mom. Uh-huh. Everything's so mixed up I don't remember anything. I think that he ripped my dress... But I might have fell. We were in his car, and he was hurting me. Oh, dear lord, you don't mean that he forced you... Corinne, she didn't say that. Were you listening? Did you hear what she said? I'm ready to be examined now, Dr. Oakley. Okay, dear. She's been hurt. There's evidence of forceful penetration. There are bruises and lacerations in and around the vaginal area. It appears your daughter has been raped. I'm, uh, prescribing some painkillers and, uh, something to help her sleep. She's a brave young woman, Corinne. But it may be that you and Michael need to listen to her... And not do anything rash. Hon... what the hell are you doing out here? Is something wrong? God, Corinne, what is it? It's marianne, darling. Marianne? Why? Where is she? She's all right now. She's up in her room. She's not ill. Michael, something's happened. Who did it? Mort lundt's boy... Zachary. No, honey... She's all right now. She's resting! She's been so brave! Hon... Button, I want you to come with me now. No, daddy. We're going to chautauqua falls. We'll wake up the district attorney. I can't do that. Yes, you can. But I can't... No. You tell them everything he did to you. I was drinking, daddy. I don't remember everything. But I'll be with you. No, I can't do that. I can't give testimony against him. Daddy, no... don't cry! Oh, my girl... I'm so ashamed! Dad, what is it? Michael... What's going on? Nothing. Hey, don't eat out of that carton. Go in the den, both of you. No one tells US what's going on in the house. I'm sick of this. Hey. How's it going, Michael? What the hell are you doing here? Corinne called and told me you might be headed here. You got a problem? Not me. It's those bastards. I'm not afraid to talk with him, officer. We can clear this up right... Zachary has been... Where is he? We've grounded him for six weeks. Where is he? He's not here. The hell he isn't! You little bastard, you get your ass down here! This is my house! You should be arresting that punk for abuse, assault... You bastard... What did you do to my daughter?! Ugh! No! Ugh! Michael! It's over. It's all right, son. It's all right. What did you do to my girl?! Several bruised ribs, and his nose was broken when you threw him down the stairs. I talked to mort lundt. If you don't file charges against the boy, then Zachary and his father won't bring charges against you. And even if you were to bring charges, you'd need marianne's testimony. Daddy, I am so sorry... But I can't bear false witness. I think we're done here. Do not worry, okay? He's gonna pay for this. Then how come you're so busy making yourself pretty like nothing ever happened? What did Zachary do? You don't need to know. Of course he needs to know. He's a member of the family! He does not need to know! I've got people waiting. I'm out of here. It's a fact that the most beautiful clock can always stop ticking, its slender black hands forever arrested on a mysterious, fatal moment. No one would be able to name what had happened. "Rape" was a word that came not to be spoken at high point farm, like "cancer" or "death." Really? Come on. Marianne! My god! Trish! You never called back. Hi, Mrs. Mulvaney. How are you? We missed you. So, um, what happened? We heard you were... Sick. Well, I-I have been, but, um, I'll be better soon. This'll help... chocolate. Feel better! Come on. So the rumors flew... The whispered jokes. What chance did marianne have against Zachary lundt? His friends would rally around him... Her word against theirs. How could she put on her cheerleading uniform or walk down those halls again? Here we go! Here we go! Hey, I think it's time we talked about my sister. And what about her? Huh? You know something I don't know? Hey, hey, hey! Let's go, mule. Come on. Get him, Zack! Go, 4! Stay on your man! Stay on your man! Get it! Get it! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Stay on your man! Go, rams! Yeah! Yeah! Go! Go! Go! Play together! Come on! Toss me the ball! Here! Here! Here! Here... here! Give him the ball! Give him the ball! He's over! I can't believe that! You're a jerk on the court and off! What crap! Did you see that little son... Your language! You jerk! Timeout! Ugh! What's with you two, huh? You tear each other down, you tear down the whole team! Don't make a scene. I'm just gonna go have a smoke. You're benched. Oh, i'm benched? Did you see what he d... i'm benched? Let's get back in there. Okay, guys. Let's go. Let's get back in the game. Come on, guys. Michael? Ray. I can't believe that little son of a bitch... I've been wanting to talk to you. I-I don't know how to say this. Uh, your bid on the civic center? Yeah? Well, they went with that outfit over at chautauqua. What, they... they came in lower than I did? I'm your friend, Michael. All I'm gonna say... Mort lundt carries a lot of weight in this town. Oh, ray, ray... Wait a sec... mort lundt... Be honest, Michael. Girls can drink and lose control of themselves, too. It's not just the boys who get aggressive. Are you saying... I gotta get back to the game. Ray? Ray! Why won't daddy talk to me? Why won't he even look at me? He just needs time, honey, you know... alone. We have to pray, button. We have to pray for the lord to help US through all of this. Come... Bless them that curse you... And pray for them which despitefully use you. And unto him that smiteth thee on one cheek, turn to him the other also. Mr. Larson says that mathematics is the only truth. Even the laws of nature are mathematical. I don't follow that at all. I don't understand that. I mean, what does mathematics say of life, of the evolutionary branchings of life through millions of years? How can the laws of nature be mathematical? I don't know. Ask Mr. Larson. Michael... I was never good at mathematics. But then, I was just a gawky, homely... farm girl. You want me to quit the team because that jerk's on it? Yeah, why not? You know, you guys made quite a spectacle out there. Mule mulvaney and Zachary lundt on the court... Teammates. You know what? You're her twin, right? A bond made in the womb? Huh? Why don't you do something about it? Where you going, mom? Oh, uh, I'll be right back, honey. And if I'm not, I'll call. Hey! How long has he been coming here, hawley? Just started seeing him again a few weeks ago. How bad is he? Sick drunk? Passed-out drunk? He got into kind of a disagreement with a local guy. He looks worse than he is. I put him to bed in one of the rooms. No shape to drive. You both can stay the night. No, thanks. I'll take him home. Do you hate it here that much? I'm sorry, honey. I don't know what the hell happened. One minute, I was okay... The next, I... It's not what happened, Michael. It's what you've done. No, I'll tell you what I've done. I went to the chautauqua county district attorney, and I demanded that son of a bitch talk to me in person... Bring charges against the little bastard. I lost my temper, and he threw me out. Oh, Michael. "Not a winnable case if the victim refuses to testify..." that's what he said. That punk has ruined US in this town. We're like lepers. No, don't say that, Michael. I wish to hell I could think of what else to do. My sweet girl... I... I-I could kill for her... My baby girl. Don't say such things, Michael. It's a sin to say such things! But i-I'm not strong enough. Corinne... What? I can't bear the sight of her any longer. I love her too much. I wish to god I never had to lay eyes on her again. Michael... God forgive me. I know, darling. I know. Hi, you guys! How'd the bio test go? Good. Oh, great. Look, I want to talk to you before we get to the house. Now, everything is okay. It's just that, uh, well, marianne, uh... Marianne went on a bus up to salamanca today. What for? She's just gonna stay with my cousin Ethel a while... Just till things calm down here, you know. Are you serious? She couldn't go back to school here, pinch. It was making her sick. And Ethel's very, very nice. She even let her take muffin with her. The cat was sitting on the bus, just looking out... This is absurd. Patrick, stop! Please don't say anything in front of your father. How could you agree to that, mom?! It was his idea, wasn't it? I hate him. Don't say that, Patrick. I hate him! Don't say that! You don't hate your father! Patrick... How could you do that? Why'd you send her away? What's going on? Nobody told you? That's typical. Why did you send her away?! None of your business. She didn't do anything wrong! What kind of father are you? Don't you talk to me that way. Now, you treat me with respect. Don't you have chores to do, Patrick? Dad, what's going on? Huh? I don't have the answer for it... Why my mother sent marianne away. Maybe she thought it would save dad, the family, the farm. Maybe dad was really her firstborn... Her first love. Or maybe it was like Patrick said... Our lives are not our own, but in the possession of others... Our parents... A genetic web, the ties of blood, the oldest curse... Older than god. "Am I loved? Am I wanted? Who would want me if my parents don't?" My genius brother Patrick set off a stink bomb during his own high school valedictory speech and escaped to Cornell on a prestigious scholarship. He would never live at high point farm again. To exorcise the memory of marianne, he had to exorcise himself from the memory's source. To him, the cobweb of our family had been broken. And once you see a web in such a way, it's too late. It's no longer a web. College wasn't in the cards for mule mulvaney, and that included sports. He quit after one semester and two d.U.I.S. What's it to you, huh? His life had become what you'd call "complicated," so he moved back to mt. Carman, went to work for my dad. But relations between father and son became strained... More than strained. Hello? It didn't help my dad that he didn't have to face marianne. He still had to face himself. Sorry, he's not here right... No... I'm sure he's on his way, though. Okay. Bye. He seemed to have forgotten marianne entirely. Instead, his excited focus was a small circle of men in mt. Carman who wronged him and continued to wrong him. Mr. Mulvaney! Hardly see you around here anymore. Can I get you the usual? What do you mean, "the usual"? Just get me a draft. Hello, ray. How's it going? Judge, how's the family? Mind if I, uh, join you gentlemen? Excuse me. Hey, hey, I pay my dues, don't I? What, do I smell bad? Don't embarrass yourself, Michael. No, this is strictly business. I want to talk to you about my court case. See, my buddy ray here and I, we have a handshake agreement... Michael, this is not the appropriate time... Appropriate, my ass! Was I talking to you? Judge, please... I just need... I'm sorry. It's not my habit to discuss court business in the club. You son of a bitch... Hey! Well, you know, my dad... My dad's a screw-up, right? He's on the front page of the paper, then the damn country club kicks him out. You know what happens? They send him back his dues in an envelope. And you know what my mom did with the check? What? She tears it up! Well, the doctor says she just has a broken collarbone. Oh, thank god! She's gonna be okay. I send you over to repair some barn roofs, and you nearly kill the farmer's daughter! The poor girl is in there. We've got to go talk to her parents. I'm sorry. I screwed up one time. One time? You can't get to work on time! Shh! Michael... Another screw-up, and I will break your ass. Yes, sir. Any questions? No, sir. You disappoint me, number 4. I wish dad were here. I don't know where he is. He wanted to be here. He must have gotten stuck on the job again. Yeah, sure he did. Thank you. I just thought he would like to see me turn my life around. You take care of yourself. God bless you. Hold up the fort, buddy boy. Yes, sir. My dad never knew about the time we went to see marianne. She hadn't come home, not even for Christmas. She dropped out of school and was living 100 miles away in some sort of co-op, a place none of US had ever seen. We only talked to her once in a while, and even then, mom was always hovering over me, saying in her mom voice, "keep the conversation short. This isn't a local call." Mama? Oh, mama! Oh! Judd, look at you! Come on, I'm gonna show you... I'll show you my room. Oh, muffin, do you remember me? Oh, he hasn't changed a bit, has he? You let his whiskers grow out. How is Molly-o and silky doing? The dogs and the barn cat? They're great. What about feathers? The cows, the sheep, all the animals... How are they doing? Everybody's f... What about daddy? Oh, your father's really working hard these days. So, do you like it here? Oh, it's wonderful. We're just like a family. Did you see our greenhouses? We have beautiful orchards. We're selling bread and preserves practically all over the state. That's because of abelove. He's the director. He's wonderful. And I have a roommate... Felix-Marie. And she's... Wonderful. You know, when I was a young mother, mealtimes at our house were wild. We had, what, three highchairs at the table, or was it four, marianne? Oh, well, marianne wouldn't know! She was one of the babies. Abelove! I'd like you to meet my mother, Corinne, and my brother judd. Welcome. Hello. We are so grateful for marianne and her tireless spirit of optimism. Good. Please, eat. Well, the green isle co-op, it's not a formally run organization. It's like a business... Except we pool our earnings... People helping each other out. From each, what he or she can give to each as he or she requires. Now, who said that? P.T. Barnum? Judd, are you ready to go, honey? One minute, mom. I'll get my stuff. You shouldn't. You're the guest. No, I want to help. Marianne, this is all wrong. You should be in college, like Patrick. Oh, come on. Patrick's the smart one. You're smart, too. I know myself now, baby. I'm fine. I'm... I'm not cut out for school... The competition and all that. You know what? I'm really happy here. I-I really am. Does dad ever... Say anything about me? Every time I call, he's not home. Doesn't he ever say my name? Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Well, we'd better get started. We have a long drive. Please accept this... You've been so generous to US... please. Marianne's family is a family of ours. Well, thanks. We can always use a donation. Judd, honey, let's go. One minute. I did want to ask you... Uh, Mrs. Mulvaney... Corinne. Uh, your daughter... I must confess, I wonder what makes her so sad. What? She frequently cries, and when I try to talk... I'm not in the habit of discussing my daughter with strangers, abelove... is that it? Mrs. Mulvaney, marianne is not a stranger to any of US. Well, you're a stranger to me, Mr... Whatever your silly made-up name is. Judd, please come on now! You'll stay over next time, right? You promise? Bye, baby. Oh... okay. Say hello to dad, and tell him... And Mike, too... Tell them I'm thinking about them all the time. Give a kiss and a hug to the animals for me. Mama... When can I come home? Soon, honey... soon. Your father's... Everything will be all right. Bye-bye. The things we didn't say, we three mulvaneys... Well, we painted about five years ago, I guess. Well, things fade. Everything's so rundown. It's gonna be a lot of work. Did I mention to you that this was a safe house for the underground railroad during the civil war? Oh, I did... I did. Yes. And the barns? Oh, well, the barns... The barn's are in very good shape, considering. We sold the horses, you know, at auction. It's expensive to keep horses. Just... just broke my heart. Well, we have debts to pay. My husband's taken out loans to pay loans, hiring lawyers to sue lawyers. We have to sell. This is the sale of a lifetime... Our lifetime. We wanted to take this down, but we haven't gotten to it yet. I was thinking of inviting you to share more responsibility with me, marianne, as associate director. It's a new post. Oh, no, abelove. I'd probably mess things up. Marianne mulvaney, when have you ever messed up? I have. I mean... You're the most capable person in the co-op. You've got US all organized. Everyone loves you. I mean, I know you've suffered. I can see it in your eyes. You can? Uh-oh. Marianne... Do you feel anything for me at all? Yes, I do. I do. I admire everything that you've done here. I was thinking of something else... Something more. I'm not what you think, abelove. And I have hurt people... My family, especially... My mom... My dad... You know, it doesn't matter what you did or do or think you did. I have to go. Felix-Marie is waiting for me. You... I mean, you do feel something for me, don't you? The way you look at me, I... I do. I do. But I don't... Deserve you. All right. Come on, please stop. Hey, marianne. Come here. So, after my b.A., I'll get in the ph.D. Program, maybe work with Dr. Maynard herring on this massive project which involves the development of new antibiotics. I j... I just... I'm so glad to be out of mt. Carman. Aren't you, marianne? Judd sent me some photos from back home. He's doing an article for a newspaper. Oh, and he said dad's got a new car... A Lincoln continental. I thought he was deep in debt with those legal payments. Well, it's a second-hand 1970. And, Patrick, listen... The other night, the phone was ringing, and I picked it up, and it was mom. We talked for 40 minutes, and before she hung up, she said that she thinks if dad was home, he would want to speak to me. She started crying, and I was crying, and it was wonderful. I think dad's almost ready... How can you call him "dad"? He's a blind, selfish man. He's cruel. I don't understand why you care about him. Let him go. Why are you so angry? Why aren't you? I don't allow myself to get angry. Marianne... Marianne, I did some research on rape... And they say it's common for a rape victim to avoid mirrors and all direct confrontations with all images of... Patrick... I know you're uncomfortable talking about Zachary lundt. But I think it's always there in your mind. I'm... I'm cold. Okay? Let's... let's just go. Judd, is anybody else on the line? No. No, dad's away on business in marsena. He's staying all night. And mom was packing, but now she's sleeping. Why, what's wrong? There's a lot of things wrong. Marianne's life is ruined. Zachary lundt is playing football on a scholarship. I need your help, judd. I had never heard more powerful words, and all I wanted was my brother to love me. What kind of help? Executing justice. Patrick and marianne had been brother and sister through all of their conscious lives. Each was more closely genetically related to the other than to their own parents. So, when marianne began to wander, Patrick lost his compass. Revenge consumed him. He said the Greeks knew how blood calls out for blood. He said it was inborn. In our genes. The instinct for justice. The need to restore balance. The state administers justice, but who is the state? That's just more people. I've given a lot of thought to this, judd. I'm not acting impulsively. Always at the back of my mind I see marianne abused, vilified, exiled by her family. Like we're some primitive tribe. Like she's our virgin sacrifice. It's ridiculous! It's intolerable. I won't tolerate it. Hey, judd, are... I'm sorry. Are you still there? I'm always here, Patrick. I'll demand... An admission of guilt from Zachary lundt. He's a liar and a rapist and he deserves to be punished. You'll bring the gun for me, won't you? And some ammunition. I can't be seen near mount carman. What are you gonna do? Hey, judd, if you want out of this, y-you go right ahead. I can do it alone. No. No, I'm in this. A hundred percent. It's the story of American farms and small towns in the latter half of the 20th century. One by one they went away. They left. And while Patrick's many months of planning were building to a fevered pitch, his advice to me was mind my own business, take care of mom, and as for dad, stay out of his way. Oh, thank goodness there's a basement... Even if there isn't a tree. I don't know how people can live without trees. Oh, I guess just as well that old feathers kicked the bucket. Yeah. I would like to get another canary, though, you know. Or a parrot! Yeah, somebody to talk to. How old was he? Feathers? In bird years? No, no. Mikey. In this picture. Oh, that was just about the time that he chewed through the toaster cord. Thank the lord it wasn't plugged in, huh? That kid, the minute he got teeth, he used them. Oh, well, he's grown up now. Marines made a man out of him. Yeah. Whistle? Yeah? You think he's ever coming back? Sure. I bet that when he does, he'll want to work with you again in the business. That's not gonna happen. Yes, it will. If you don't push him too hard. There is no business. You could start over I'm sucked dry! Look, Michael, I have seen you bounce back time and time again. We have together. If you believe... In what? Jesus? In US! My god, why don't you just say what you feel for once? I'm a failure! A loser! Go ahead. Say it! No, Michael! Say it! I didn't deserve you from the beginning! I'm not going to listen to this! Come on! I want you to give me the truth! Give me the truth, damn it! Give me the truth! You're drunk! Just leave her alone! Michael! Stop! You leave him alone! Aah! Judd, honey. Oh, you make me sick. Both of you, you hear me? You make me sick! Get a man in a trap. Rat in the trap! Head in a vise! Cage him in barbed wire! We just have to pray for him, that's all. We've passed prayer, mom. We passed prayer a long time ago. And just like that, he was gone... Never to return. There gets to be a point when life starts going fast, then faster and faster, and suddenly, Michael mulvaney was taken by surprise. His little boat was in rough, unfriendly waters, storm winds, heavy waves spinning him out of control. The same storm that was also spinning my brother Patrick out of control. Patrick... I don't know what to think. You're the most promising undergraduate in the department, but I read this... And your work. It's sloppy, undisciplined, unjustified. I don't know what to do about this. I do. So, how do you know where he is? Christmas break. I called his mother and pretended to be a friend. He's at the river inn. You have any trouble getting it? No, the key was right in the cabinet. Anybody see you with it? No, I came through the woods. What exactly are you gonna do? We'll see you later. Drive safe. We'll see you. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Get out! Please don't shoot! You can have my wallet... Shut up! Get in the Jeep! We can go to my parents' house. I got other plans for you, rapist. Rapist? You know exactly what I'm talking about! Drive! Keep your eyes on the road. Don't look at me. Don't shoot me... Shut up! Take this next turn out of town. Tell me what this is about. Please. See that dirt road? Turn now. Get out. Get out! Where are you taking me? Don't ignore me! Keep going! We're going down the hill. Please! Keep going! Oh, my arm! I think it's broken! Get up! Oh, please don't... Did it hurt? Tell me! Did it hurt?! I won't do anything, I swear! Please! Please! Walk, lundt! Leave me alone! What's wrong with your legs?! Come on! Why are you doing this? I don't even know you. You know me. You raped my sister! Raped?! Who?! Oh, there's been so many? Is that it, lundt? Ruining people's lives! You don't deserve to live! Please, no! Have mercy! Don't stumble like that. Keep going! Don't look at me! I'll blow your head off! Help me! Help me! Help yourself, rapist! Say it! Say "I'm a rapist." I'm a rapist! All right. Say "I deserve to be punished." I deserve to be punished! Say "I deserve to die." Keep going! Please, don't. Go. Don't whine. Get in there. Get in the water! I'm sorry! You arenot! You brought this all on yourself. Please! Help me! I beg you! Please! Let me live! I can't swim! You okay? What happened? I didn't even hurt him. I ought to let you die! Filth! Suffocate in filth! It's what you deserve! You rapist! You murderer! You may as well have killed her! Please! Help me! Damn it! Please. No! Please! No! Help me! Please! Help me! Please! All right. Hey, lundt, take hold. I'll let you live. I could have let you die, but I let you live. You remember that. I didn't even hurt him. I can't explain it, but it doesn't matter. Good. Now listen, judd, I won't be talking to you or mom for a while. Why not? I'm gonna be traveling across the country. What about school, Patrick? That's not important. But thank you. Hey, judd, don't worry. She's free. We're free. I love you, Patrick. Ugh! It's okay, muffin. Yes, it's gonna be okay. How old is he? His name is muffin. Mm-hmm. I don't know. He's been losing so much weight. He hasn't been eating. And then he just disappeared. I found him hiding in the woods behind the cabin where we were staying and... I know that he's over 12. Mm-hmm. But his fur is still healthy and clean and so soft. He's got clear eyes. I checked them... Actually, his eyes are turning yellow. Jaundice... No, his eyes are golden. I'm sorry. Please don't apologize. An animal knows when its time has come. That's probably why muffin has... Is there something that you can do? Because I have money saved. I can pay for whatever you have to do. Why don't you leave him here? Come back in a couple days. This, uh, cabin where you're staying... Actually, I'm in-between. Let me see what I can do. Maybe I can prolong it. Make him a little more comfortable. Yeah. There's a room at the back you can stay in if you like. I think muffin would like that. Having you close. Maybe this was a mistake. We've talked about this for four months. How things would be changed. How things would be a little better. You're right. Look, whit! Oh, there it is. Oh, my goodness. They got new horses. Oh! I don't see Molly-o. Oh, she's beautiful. Chestnut red. You're gonna love her. I-I can't do this. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. It's the right thing to do. It's as if I've been gone a hundred years... And just came back. Can I help you? Yes. Hi. The mulvaneys, please. Oh. They don't live here anymore. I've got to get the phone. They sold the house? I think they found a place closer to mount carman, and then I think they moved again. You're not dripping oil are you? We just put down new gravel. They never even told me. Maybe they didn't know where you were. Maybe they didn't try. Marianne. Marianne. The first time, whit... It's really hit me. I don't have a home. You have a home. I know that. Mother said it was nature's way to scatter, and both Patrick and marianne would be in touch with US soon. But then we moved again. The mulvaneys were all leading what my mom called "rag-quilt lives." Oh, hi, Marge. Welcome back. What about dad's clubs? Should we sell them? No! Put them in the basement. He might want them when he comes home. Homemade sign, huh? Big letters. I just can't come up with a name. How 'bout "Corinne's antiques"? Corinne is an antique. Huh! You know, I was thinking, that little room in the back upstairs, that would be nice for marianne and Patrick when they come home. Mom, we don't even know where they are. Yeah. Well, a good mother would know where her children are. Don't say that. No... I don't know. It just keeps running over and over and over in my mind. If I'd just handled things differently. Ah, nah, never mind. This is a new start, hmm? It's gonna be fine. Yeah. You're gonna meet a lot of your old friends through the store. You know, I've got a "to do" list, and "renewing old friendships" is number three. Son, you're looking at your father like he's some kind of dog. No, dad. Hell, it just that I have a hard time sometimes. The civilian world. It's not you. Really. Off you base, things seem to be coming apart. Nobody seems to know what the hell they're doing. You do. Yes, sir, I do. A marine fulfills his responsibility. Which is? His assignment. Whatever his superior officer tells him to do. I'll drink to that. I always knew I should have been a marine. I had what it takes. Hard ass. Harder head. But I got married instead. By the time I was your age, I was up to here in it. Well, dad, this is Vicky. My fiancée. I told you about her. Mighty pretty. Yes. Dad, mom moved back to mount carman... After you called, I started thinking about me and you... opened an antique store. About US forming a new company. Mulvaney and son... I have a career in the marines. Roofing. Do you want to hear about mom... Your wife? No, I'm on furlough from all that. She thinks about you all the time. All these years, she keeps track of you. She prays for you. I don't discuss my personal life with anyone. But this is ourfamily. And I love my family. Well? My father told me to get the hell out when I was young. "You're no son of mine. It's a boy's world in america, but only if you're a winner." And your mom... Oh, she was so good and so strong and she kept me from ending up in the gutter. And then look at me now, son, I'm ended up here anyway, haven't I? Didn't you want to... You wanted to leave... Didn't you want to, son? Where'd you want to go? Leave? Go where? Didn't you say, uh... Say what? Mmm... Terrific meal. We'll be back. Mikey... Remember that white horse you kids used to have a long time ago? Beautiful animal. Belonged to one of you boys. Hey... You remember? I don't remember the white horse. Oh, sure you do. Handsome fella. It was a white horse. No. Yes. A white... white mane. Yeah. Yeah, he... what was his name? Name me some names. Uh, I don't... It was... what was it? Here, let me. There was, uh... Crackerjack, my pony. There was junior Jones. And prince. No? There was big red. Clover. No, no. Marianne, she had Molly-o. Right? I don't remember the white horse. Dad... Will you promise me that you're gonna check yourself into a clinic? Will you do that for me? Huh? Yeah? Maybe. Maybe. If you'll promise me, when I die, you'll cremate my body and scatter my ashes at high point farm. The kindest thing you can do for me. Yes, sir. A-a-a-men. And uh... Keep the wind at your back, kid. 'Cause you're not gonna get a second chance. Yes, sir. I guess it's no surprise I ended up working on the campus newspaper in college. I was always the observer. Watching. Listening. Trying to find the truth, which I've learned never exists in any one form. And I guess it was no surprise when I got the news that morning. Good heavens, can you believe it? I mean, he just collapsed on the street. Cancer's been growing in him for years and years and nobody knew it. Dad is indigent. He hasn't had any care at all. H-He's been in the hospital in Rochester for a week. Nobody even had the decency to look through his things to see if he had any family. I'm still his wife. Hello? One moment, please. Marianne. Marianne? It's mom. I'm at the park medical center in Rochester, and your dad's, uh... Well, he's very ill. And he's requested to see you. Can you come? I'll leave right away. Hurry. All these years... Now he's dying. Come on. I'll help you get your stuff. All marianne ever cared about was dad. And now he wanted to see her. So she knew what it was, what it must be. "Hurry." after years of exile. "Hurry." Oh! Marianne. My god, how grown up you are. Look at you. You're so pretty. Isn't she, judd? Her hair... You must be exhausted. Oh, I'm sorry this is such a terrible surprise. Your father... You're not gonna recognize him. His cancer has just spread all through his liver and his brain, it's metasi... Metastasized. Metastasized. That's right. Go on in. Daddy, it's me... marianne. Where? Where? Where? I... I-i-i-i didn't want to... God... God help me. Wh... where... Daddy, rest. So tired... I know. You have to rest. So tired... I... I'll go find the nurses. The doctors are never available, but the nurses are so nice. He's been killing himself for years. Judd. Shh. Daddy, can you hear me? Uh... Uh... No, don't... don't. You have to rest. You have to rest. Ma... ma... I love you, daddy. I love you, dad. Daddy recognized me, didn't he? I'm not just imagining it. Of course he did. I think he said my name. Marianne. Did you hear it? Yeah, he called you marianne. And before, he was asking for you. You heard... right, mom? He didn't ask for the boys, but he asked for you. And he waited for you. He said your name. It's Patrick! He's here! He was working in Berkeley with autistic children. He said they lived in mysterious world. Maybe it was something like the mysterious world he had always lived in. Katya, this is my brother judd. Oh, judd, I've heard so much about you from Patrick. Really? Like what? Ah, go on. You tell him. Well, he said you're a good brother. The truth is, he loves you very much. Well, it's always good to tell the truth, right? Well, welcome to the family. Come on. So, finally, I knew that Patrick loved me, that what I had risked was worth it... Patrick. Which I still believe to this day. Hi. I'm whit. Patrick, how are you man?! I want you to meet my wife. This is Vicky. Who's this? This is Katya. She's my navigator. Hi. Mike. Nice to meet you. Hi. Mom. I didn't know you were coming. Yeah, I know. That's why it's a surprise. Yeah. People send over so much food. You and whit are gonna have to take some of it home with you because there's no way we can eat all of this. People are just so good. Marianne... You know, don't you, that your father believed right up until the end that he sent you away out of love? Yeah. Yeah, I know that. I mean, it's just a thing that happene you know? It's just that way in families sometimes. A thing goes wrong, and then somebody tries to fix it. And years pass. And no one knows how to fix it. What about you, mama? Well, it just made me feel so cold. I was to blame too. 'Cause I always put your father first, before all you children. I guess that was wrong, but I don't know, you know? I just loved him so much and... He was so wonderful, and he made me feel... I know how much you loved him. The sky was the limit for Michael mulvaney and he was taking you along for the ride. I shouldn't have sent you away. I regret every day of it. But you know, honey, I knew that you would be all right 'cause you have your faith, and I knew that that would hold you in good stead and it would make you strong. But your father, you know, he would have just disintegrated. Well... he did disintegrate anyway, didn't he? I wouldn't blame you if you hated me. I don't hate you, mama. You know, there were times I was so lonely out there. I carried your flannel shirt around with me just so I could breathe you in. The scent of my mother. I adored you, mama. I still do. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. No, no, no, no. Look, no. Whatever has happened, mama, I've arrived at the place I'm supposed to be. We were the mulvaneys of high point farm. Storybook people in a storybook house. This would have made your father so happy! All of you together again. We were once the perfect dream. Sometimes something happens to a family and everyone is blown up in the air and nobody knows where they're going to land. We all landed on our feet. The world was somehow back in balance. Hey, guys. I got a camera in the car. You want to take a picture? It was as if we had been like this, at such ease with each other, for all the years we lost. As dad said, "what doesn't break you can teach you, right?" Get together, you guys. We have ten seconds. Show me some teeth. That's a laugh... Every one of US showing teeth. There was Mike Jr. Rubbing Vicky's belly, mom holding back tears, marianne with her Dr. West, and Patrick had that same expression on his face he had when we were boys... when we were the mulvaneys.
