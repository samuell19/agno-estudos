#BELIEVE# Sorry, Ben Just be very careful. Let's go This was the ballroom. Before Brookover was a school, it was somebody's private house. The family lived here for generations until tragedy struck. As a matter of fact that tragedy is the reason the family left this house and it became a school. What happened, Ben? It was over one hundred years ago. Old man Brookover's daughter, Patricia, was to be married, in this very room, to the son of her father's business partner And when the big day finally arrived, all the guests were here. But he never showed up. He sent word that he'd run off to Europe and he didn't want to get married. Well Patricia went crazy She started screaming and yelling. She made everyone leave. And then she locked herself in here. A few minutes later they heard a terrible scream. Her father and some others broke down the door And when they did they found Patricia hanging from the chandelier After that her dad sold the place. And it became Brookover Academy. The funny thing is: they've never been able to use this room. Why? - Come on, Owen. You've heard the stories. You know why. Because she won't allow it. LOOK! It's her It's Patricia Brookover. No, no Wait! Come on, guys. You'll wake the teachers What is the meaning of this? Now, I want all of you Come here, boys Look Look at your uh ghost. Well, Mr. Stiles I would have thought that you're having been expelled from your previous school for this sort of thing you'd have taught you a lesson I uh - We'll discuss this in the morning. Now, all of you. Back to bed. This gives me no pleasure. I can assure you, Mr. Stiles. Your parents are fine people and it pains me deeply to upset them. Particularly, given the stresses of your father's position as a diplomat. Don't sweat it, Mr. Higgins. My dad's used to me causing him stress. I'm sure. It's a pity that a boy of your obvious abilities and leadership potential should waste it all on terrible practical jokes People like to be scared. - That's absurd. Utterly absurd. You might have seriously traumatized those boys. I didn't mean to - Of course you meant to. You're expelled from Brookover. You'll be leaving in the morning. So am I going to my parents? I spoke to your father this morning. Things at the embassy are a little tense at the moment. They felt it would be best if you would go and stay with your Grandfather Stiles. My grandfather Stiles? You've got to be kidding? I assure you I am not. I've only seen the guy twice in my whole life. My dad barely speaks to him. Frankly, Mr. Stiles, I'm not in the least bit interested in your interfamily relationships. If you want answers, you'll have to speak to your parents. A driver will take you to the airport in the morning. You can retrieve all of this at that time. Now you are dismissed. Could I uh? - That is all. But, Dad - But nothing, Ben. You brought this on yourself. Okay, okay. So I got expelled. But why do I have to go to the home of the unkown grandfather? Why can't I come to you and Mom? - Things are extremely delicate here right now, Ben. I'm meeting with government officials everyday for hours at a time, Now I was really counting on you to stand tough. Well, why can't I stay with Grandmother? - She's recovering from a hip surgery, Ben. Now, I guess I could send you to Miami to stay with Grandpa Willis. In the old folks home? No thanks. So you see? It's not like as if we had a lot of choice here. He can hardly speak English. And you don't even visit him. He speaks English perfectly well. And this will give me an excuse to visit him. We'll pick you up when we come through for the summer vacation, I'll be yeah I'll be able to talk with him there. And then maybe we can warm up our relationship a little bit. Now, Ben, we're running late and Mom wants to talk to you a minute. Now take care. Hello, Ben. - Hi, Mom. Look, we really don't have the time right now to go into this, but I have to tell you your father and I are vey disappointed in you I know. I'm sorry. - Yes, well we'll discuss an appropriate punishment later. Good night. I think you've already picked an appropriate punishment. You work for my grandfather long? Long enough. Long enough to know where all the bodies are buried. D'you know my dad? - Seen him. Twice. Never come around much. I don't think he and your grandfather get along. He was only two when my grandparents divorced. My grandmother raised him. - Yeah, well I guess she didn't get along with your grandfather either. I wonder if you'll get along with him? - Who knows? I haven't seen him since I was five. - Yeah I remember that. I took him to the airport. It seemed funny to me 'cause he never hardly goes anywhere. What's the house like? - Wickwire House? - Yeah Wickwire House is a mystery. Even to me. It's just a big old place full of secrets. I thought you knew where all the bodies were buried. Well, the bodies I know about. This is it, boy Wickwire House. Ben? I am Jason Stiles, your grandfather. Hi. I hope that dinner was adequate, hm? - Yeah, it was fine. I'd like to tell you that while I am glad that we will have time to get to know one another, I don't approve of you getting expelled from the school. The name of Stiles is quite known here and well respected. And I hope you won't be repeating any of your foolishness and attract the wrong attention to our name. I hope we understand each other? - Yes, Grandfather. Very good. We are very close to the end of the semester and I feel there's no point of enrolling you in the local school. But I have engaged a private instructor for you. He's arriving tomorrow. Otherwise, you are free to come and go as you wish. But I expect for dinner every night. And I expect you not to wander around the grounds after dark. Especially around that road. It's dangerous. The locals are driving much too fast. Well? It's getting very late. Aren't you tired? Yeah I guess I am. - Ben, we don't know each other very well. And I know you don't feel very comfortable here and I'm not very comfortable around young people either. But in the next few weeks, I'm sure we'll find some kind of understanding. I uh I'm sure you know exactly what I mean. Is there anything else you need? - No, sir. Well then I bid you goodnight - Goodnight. Well? So much for the warm and fuzzy reunion Well, this is your copy. Oh, there is Ben. Ben? I would like you to meet your tutor. Mr. Courtney Hartney. He'll be staying with us - Hello. Ben. - I hope you'll enjoy the peace and quiet Wickwire has to offer. As I explained to you over the phone, Mr. Stiles, the peace and quiet is exactly what I need. I plan to use the evenings to finish my novel. Well I'll leave you two to it. Thank you very much, Mr. Stiles. Ben English literature has always been my favorite course of study. Why don't we begin there? Oh, it's nearly dinner time. It's more than enough work for one day. Ben, your discipline problems not withstanding, you appear to be a good student. I see no reason why we can't keep you on track with your studies. - Great. See you in a few minutes. - Alright. Oh, man, what a nightmare? Who's that? I don't want to seem as if I'm always reprimanding you, Ben, but there are rules in this house we observe. I'm sorry, Grandfather, but there was some lady out on the terrace. It's all right, Margaret. These things happen. I thought we agreed you are not going to repeat your games in this house. It's not like that, Grandfather. I din't know who she was or whether Margaret is the only woman residing at Wickwire. If you saw somebody else, they were trespassing. You see them again, call the police. Yes, sir. Margaret. - Yes, Ben. You've seen the lady too, haven't you? I don't know what you're talking about. Who is she? I'm gonna find out anyway. Leave it alone, Ben. Leave her alone. Leave who alone? Who is she? Your grandfather is a very good employer. And I like my job and for that I'll follow his wishes. Now please excuse me. Hey, Perkins - What'd'you want? I saw someone tonight. A a woman. On the terrace. I didn't think it was anything but everyone else is acting like I've seen a UFO or something. Why is that? - I don't know nothin' about no woman. I think you do. I think you all do. She's a ghost, alright? That's all I know. I can get fired just for talking about it. Now leave me alone. A ghost. I get it, I get it. You're tricking me, you know. Trying to teach me a lesson. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't care. Just drop it. You're serious, aren't you? - Dead serious. Whatever. You stick around long enough, kid. You'll see her again. Okay, lady Not again Scared you. - No kidding! What's the matter with you? Anyone that follows ghosts into a graveyard ought to be able to handle a little scare. - Oh, yeah Wait a minute. You saw her too? Yeah Sometimes I see her at my house. Other times I see her coming from the Stiles' place. That's where she was tonight. I'm Ben Stiles. Wickwire's my grandfather's house. Katherine Winslowe. I live at White Day Farm, just back over there. Nobody would talk about her at the house. Except for the driver. But he's nuts. It's the same for me. My Uncle Ellicott thinks it's just my imagination. But when I hear her cry It's not my imagination. It's not a tree or a owl or a squeaky shutters. It's It's her It's a ghost. If I knew who she was, why she was here Maybe I could help her find some peace. Could I help? Sure Just don't tell anyone. Okay? - I don't even know anyone yet. Besides if my grandfather knew I was having fun, he'd put a stop to it right away and make me study or something. Well, It's getting pretty late. We should go. - Yeah. How about if I meet you after school at the library? Maybe 3 o'clock? Sounds good. - Okay. Is that you, Katherine? Yes, Uncle. I thought no more snacking at night. Well, I just couldn't resist. How is everything? - Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Looking good, Winslowe - Yeah, looking real good. Shut up. You two are the biggest geeks. You're the geek. - We make out with cool chicks all the time. The only kisses you two get are goodnight kisses from you mom and I bet she has to wear a blindfold. - Hey, at least we got moms. Yeah Orphan! Oh What's the matter? You're gonna cry? We own this town, Winslowe. You better start treating us with some respect. Come on, Frank. Hey! What's wrong? - Nothing. Come on. I can tell something's wrong - Look, just leave me alone! Please, Katherine. Talk to me My parents were killed in a car accident last year. That's why I live with my Great-Uncle Ellicott. I'm sorry - It's okay. It's fine. Really. I deal with it, you know? And my uncle, he's great. He really helps me. But then Then, what? Those jerks, you know. They always. They're just evil. They're calling me an orphan. - Those two guys who were leaving when I got there? Yeah. - Just tell me where I can find them? No, Ben - No. Nobody has the right to treat anyone like that. Just tell me where they hang out. - Look, you'll only make things worse. They don't fight fair. They cheat. They gang up on people. Everybody is afraid of the two Franks. The two Franks? - Yeah It's their names. It's kind of funny. It is, isn't it? I'm sorry about your parents. - Thank you. I don't get to see mine all that often. But I can't imagine just not Would you like to get even with them the two Franks? What d'you mean? - Would like to bring them down? I'd love to. So this is it? - Yeah. Every kid in town knows the Swiger house. They say old man Swiger's daughter haunts the place. Probably hung herself on her wedding day. That's right. How'd you know? - Lucky guess. It's perfect - Perfect for what? I'll explain later. We better get to the library. This is gonna take some time. D'you want to start wading through it or d'you want to look through the books? Nah, I'm into books. Knock yourself out. As you wish. Find anything? - I've something very interesting printing. It's amazing how much stuff you can find on ghosts and ghost hunting. Tell me about it. I've lost track on how many web pages there are. This is a very interesting lady. Professor Muriel Twyman. She's a professional paranormal investigator. A real ghost hunter. - Exactly. And you're not gonna believe this. She's gonna be the University on the 5th to give a lecture. That's only 30 miles from here. - You're right and we're going. If anyone can help. She can. So, you still haven't told me why you wanted to look at the Swiger's house. You told me all the kids think it's haunted, right? - Oh, yeah. And you wanted to get back at the two Franks? - Obviously Did I ever tell you how it was I was asked to leave the last couple of schools I attended? - No Mr. Harney tells me you are quite a good pupil. I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad you're glad. - He tells me also you went to the library this afternoon. Yeah - Excellent, excellent. Putting in the extra mile, improving yourself, hm? Perhaps that was the problem in your school. You were not sufficiently engaged. But here out in the country, you won't be disturbed by all the foolishness one encounters in the world. Concentrate. Apply yourself. Yes, sir. You're probably right. I'm sure of it. Are you absolutely, positively sure it'll work? - Positive. The biggest problem will be getting power to the Swiger house but I think I can do that with battery packs. What about the equipment? - I have everything we'll need. I don't know, Ben. If this doesn't work, it's not so bad for you. I mean, you're leaving in a few weeks. I'll be trapped here with them. When we're through they won't show their faces for years. And besides, it'll keep us busy until we can see Professor Twyman. Oh, all right. - Excellent. You won't be sorry. Believe me. It won't be long now. We'll help you. I promise. I'm so nervous. What if someone sees us? I'd hate to get arrested. - We won't. How can you be so sure? - Because my grandfather owns this place. You're kidding. How d'you know? Well, I went to the courthouse to look for anything on our young Miss Swiger. You know, to use for our little presentation. I found both the deed and the will for Swiger. When the old man died, my grandfather bought the place from his estate. I guess he's always bying up propreties around town. And what about her young Miss Swiger? I hate to break it to you. Mr. Swiger never had any kids. So there's no ghost? Well none that I know of. But there's gonna be. First, we'll sketch out a floor plan of the place, then we'll start with the modifications. Modifications? - What? Do you think we're just gonna put sheets on and yell " boo "? I don't know what we're doing. We're gonna haunt this house. It's perfect. Take this down. 2-9. That's not video tape? No, it's super 8 movie film. People used it for home movies before there was video. Uh why are you using it? - I have to mail it in to be developed. I'll show you when it gets back. Okay, ready? - Yeap. - Act scary. As the perfume's tinture of the roses hang on such thorns and play as wanted. When the summer's breath, their masked buds disclose for if I could write the beauty of your eyes and all of your Okay. Now wail. Come on. Remember. You're doomed to wander the earth for eternity. Okay. It's descent. From in there, we'll control everything. It's ready. How about you? Oh yeah I'm ready. Well if it isn't the little orphan girl. You think you're so tough picking on a girl. Who said you're a girl? - Yeah who said you're a girl? You guys are cowards as well as idiots. I don't want to hit a girl but just don't push it. You think you're so tough. - I don't have to think. I'm sure you don't. But isn't there anything you're afraid of. - Nothing in this world. Well I bet there is. I bet you wouldn't be able to handle one night in the Swiger house All night. - That's stupid. - Not for a tough guy like you. Hey, it's no problem. Okay? Tonight. Right, Frank? Frank? - Yeah, right. Sure. Tonight. Good. We'll have some witnesses for when you guys come out of there screaming when the ghost comes after you. Don't hold your breath. They took the bait. We're on. Tonight. Excellent. I'll be there as soon as I can - Okay. Bye. What're you doing here? - I'm a witness. I want proof. Yeah. Well, I hope you're ready to stay out here all night. Hey, get outta here! - Come on. I doubt I'll be here long. You bring a flashlight? - No. Did you? Do I have to think about everything? - You want I could go get one? No No way. Take a look. We're going in. We got no choice. So How we gonna get in? - The door, stupid. They're in. Over. - Roger that. I'll have to maintain radio silence now. Over. Well May as well take a look around. What's the matter with you? - Sorry, man. Just-just don't do it again, alright? - Sure. Let's check out the upstairs. What a dump - Yeah maybe we should go back downstairs. Yeah, maybe you're right; back downstairs. Frank. - I hear it. I- I-I'm outta here. - You're not going anywhere. That goofy chick is probably trying to scare us out of here and make us look bad and I you're playing right into Okay. Let's head back downstairs. Pull yourself together, Frank! - I'm getting out of here, man! - No, you aren't! There. It's over. Now we're gonna stick around. Let's get out of here. Come on. Open it. Get it open. - I can't. It's locked. It keeps locking. The chickens are about to leave the roost. - Roger that. We're never gonna get out! - Would you stop being a baby! Help! - Help. Come one! Come on! Help me! It's locked! It's open. You feel better? - I feel great. Maybe tomorrow night we could photograph our ghost. Sure. - We better go back and get our stuff. Alright. Ben May I see you a moment? Oh sure. It's a little late, isn't it? - Sorry, Grandfather. I must have lost track of time. - Where were you? I uh I was down in town. Hanging out with some other kids. Well I understand we don't have the typical relationship of grandfather and grandson and that perhaps you do not feel that I'm entitled to discipline you or ask things of you. But this is my house. I'd like you to respect that. I do, Grandfather. If you are going to be late next time, just call. And if you need to go to town, I have Perkins drive you. I just don't want you up and down traveling that road. I won't, Grandfather. Goodnight. God I know I don't thank you nearly enough but thanks for not letting my grandfather kill me and thanks for Katherine. Where did you get all this stuff? Christmas. Birthday. Miscellaneous missed holidays It's one of the benefits of absentee parents. Hey Katherine. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - No, no, it's not. I mean who am I to complain. Look, Ben My parents are gone and I have to get used to that. I can't expect the world to walk around on eggshells 'cause they might hurt my feelings. Besides I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. I really impressed with what you did. These two guys are finished in this town. I heard something. - What is it? There's something out there. Benjamin. - Oh, no. What on earth is going on here? We were uh - We? Who is " we "? My friend Catherine and I Hello, Mr. Stiles. - I had no idea Ben had a young lady friend. How do you do? - Grandfather, this is Katherine Winslowe. Of the Winslowes of White Day Farm? - Yes, sir. You probably know my uncle, Ellicott. Young lady. I'll thank you to keep away from my grandson Let's go, Ben. - Grandfather! - Now, Benjamin! I don't know what's wrong with him. I'll call you. Uncle Ellicott? - Yes Catherine. It was awful. - What' was awful? It was my friend Ben. His grandfather came and he got mad and said Ben and I couldn't hang around anymore. Why would he say something like that? Did you do something wrong? No, no. Of course not. - What's the boy's name? What's the grandfather's name? - Ben Stiles. I don't know his grandfather's name. What did you say? Ben Ben-Ben Stiles. I'm afraid I must agree with the boy's grandfather. You are not to see him again. Never! But I deserve to know why. I deserve to know the truth. Why? Just because you asked? You have no right to ask me for anything. I'm your family! I do have a right! I have a right too. I have a right to be obeyed in my own house. I expressely asked you to stay away from the area of that road and you disobeyed me. - I crossed the road to go to the cemetary. Same as I do to go to town. - Which I asked you not to do. I don't approve your staying at the cemetery. I find it's totally morbid. I forbid it. - You can't expect me just do what you say because you say it. You don't... - Go ahead. Finish. There are things in this family you don't understand. It's her. It's the ghost. You are absurd. Go to your room. Who is she? - I can't stand it any longer. Go. Go. Go. - Grandfather! I don't want to fight with you I just want to understand Yes? - Dad, it's me Ben? It's the middle of the night? What's wrong? Dad Do you know who the lady is in the portrait in Grandfather's room? I have no idea what you're talking about. Okay. Do you know why he hates the Winslows? Who are the Winslowes? - Uh they live next door. No, I do not. Now, Ben - Dad, this is very serious. I think he knows who the ghost is and I think... I really should have known. What is this? A plea for attention? What? This must stop. Now I know he may not be the best father or grandfather of the world but he does not deserve to be the butt of one of your jokes. It's not like that, Dad. I know I sound like the boy who cried wolf but - But nothing, Ben. Now, this needs to stop. Now. Hey! - Hey. I don't understand. What is their problem? - I don't know. But being out here in the open like this makes me a nervous wreck. - I know a place. So he wouldn't tell you anything? - Nothing. But it was more than that. I have never seen him so angry Same here. Especially after I saw the painting. You're positive it's her? - No question at all. Hm I just feel we're failing her. - Well don't. We're not giving up. We still have two weeks before my parents come home. It wouldn't matter if we had two years. They'll do anything to keep us apart. Look. We'll just have to deal with them. Now, tomorrow's Twyman's lecture. I have our transportation all lined up. You just need to be ready for 7:30. Can you do that? - Yeah I guess. What if we get caught. Please, Katherine. I've been to private school. I'm an expert at this. Yeah, but You also got kicked out of private school. True Just trust me. Okay? - Okay. It's not bad. Although, I may have issues with some of your conclusions. In general, it's not bad. - Great, great, great. Can we go now? Yeah, I suppose so. Mr. Stiles? We'll be leaving now. - Leaving? Yes. To attend the lecture at the university. - Oh, yes. Yes. Good-bye, Grandfather - Good-bye. Stop up here. - But why? - Just stop the car. What for? - I'm bringing a friend with us. - What'd'you mean? What friend? Courtney, this is Katherine. She loves literature too. - Hi, Courtney. Come on, Courtney. Let's go. We don't want to miss anything. This is the famous author? - Yes, she's very famous. Ben, she writes about the supernatural. Well 'yeah and she's the best in the field. Had I known that, I don't think I would've come. And I'm certain your grandfather wouldn't approve. - Then let's not tell him. Ladies and gentlemen, Professor Muriel Twyman. Good evening. Do you believe in ghosts? You should. And after tonight, you will. I've devoted my entire life to the study of the supernatural and tonight I'd like to share with you some of my findings. Would you lower the lights, please? These are some photos that I've taken of what I believe to be ghosts. The photos were taken in cemeteries in the Northeast. I've also on occasions, recorded spectral phenomena. I think you'll be quite amazed with the results. She could do a whole CD with our girl. In closing, let me say that I don't know that we can ever prove that ghosts do exist, but no one else yet can prove that they don't. Thank you and good evening. Alright, let's go. - Just wait a minute, Courtney. Wait a minute, shall we? Professor Twyman? - Yes. We've got a serious ghost situation. - Thank you. Ma'am? Ma'am? - Yes. - We're hoping that you could help. I'm sorry, dear. I'm in the middle of a book tour. I really can't spare the time. Thank you very much. - Come on. Let's get out of here. She's only in it for the money. - Excuse me for a moment. Excuse me. Young man? I'm sorry I was abrupt with you. Give me a few moments and we'll sit and talk. - Thanks. If what you're telling me is true, you have one special haunting. It is, Professor Twyman. I swear. So will you help us? I wish I could, Katherine. But I can't. Ben's right Right now, I really am in it for the money. Do you have any idea how hard it is to support one's self as a ghost hunter? Right now, I'm working like mad trying to promote this book. I'm speaking in fifteen colleges in ten states in the next two weeks. And I have to drive myself to every one of them. Professor If you only heard her. If you only knew how she suffers. I know. I've seen it before. Is there anything you can do? - Well, I can give you some advice. Why don't you find out everything you can about her? Try to ascertain exactly what it is that keeps her bound here. How? With a seance? - No. I would advise against that. It's not a good idea to call out to the spirits of the dead. You might invite a bad one in and that could be a problem. So, we shouldn't talk to her? - Well, that's different. You can go to where she is and try to talk to her. I'm not promising anything but you might be able to help her. Obvioulsy, she's a living spirit, not some echo of a past event. What d'you mean? - I believe there are two kinds of hauntings. One is a residual haunting. It kind of acts like a video tape. Something powerful happens in a place, like a battle, and somehow the echoes of the sights and sounds of that past replay, occurring exactly the way they were. Now, I believe in a second haunting and I think this is what you're experiencing is that of a spirit that hasn't moved on. That still thinks. and feels. - Ben! Really now it's time to go. Come on. - I really must go also. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. Here. Contact me. Let me know how it all turns out. We will and thank you, Professor. - Good luck. So, what'd you think, Courtney? - I thought it was utterly ridiculous. Mr. Harney, I don't approve of your behavior in this matter. It is utterly unprofessional. - I'm sorry you feel that way, sir. But under the circumstances I feel I must leave immediately This is ridiculous. - You are a grown man to believe such rubbish. I've lived in this house nearly all my life and I've seen no ghost. But I have. And it was terrifying. Sir, I cannot stay in this house another night. Don't you see, it's Ben. He's done these things before. - Ben was asleep. There is no way he could've done this. - You'd be surprised at the complexity of the tricks he's been able to pull. Don't you think I have considered all of that. I mean with what is at stake here, sir. My reputation? I even thought maybe it was a dream, especially after hearing that lecture he insisted I take them to. Them? Them, yes. Ben and his friend Katherine. Mr. Harney, I accept your resignation at once. Where is Ben now? He's gone into town to the library. Hey Lunch is only an hour. I have to be back by 12:30. I don't think an hour will be long enough. I've been checking tons of references on my family and still nothing. Should be another one on this reel somewhere. Right about here. It's her. - Mary Alice Stiles was my grandfather's sister. After my great-grandparents got to America, they had another child. A girl! - Benjamin? Go to the car! Now! Ben? Yes, sir. - I've spoken to your father. He and your mother are leaving Europe tonight. They'll be here tomorrow morning to take you home. What? Grandfather, that's crazy! I don't want to leave. - Normally that would please me to hear you say that. But since you refuse to obey me, I - I'll do everything you ask if if you'll just tell me why. Why don't you want me to know what happened to my great aunt? Stop it! - Why am I forbidden to see Katherine? What is she ever done to you? - That's enough. What are you hiding? Why does Mary Alice haunt his house? Don't you ever mention her name again. Ever! None of these things concern you. Nobody asked you to go digging into them. You're wrong, Grandfather. Someone did ask. Mary Alice did. My sister is dead. Let her rest. But she isn't at rest. Why? Why is that? You should want to help her, Grandfather. That's what families are for to help one another. Ben? What're you doing? I don't have time to explain. It has to be tonight. I'm sorry. I had to do that I didn't think if I'd get the chance again. It's okay. I didn't think you'd ever take the chance We better go. - Yeah. Katherine? - Yeah? - Over here. Did you find it? You? - Ellicott. I have no time to argue. I am here for my grandson. - Well, he's not here. And if you don't get off my proprety, I'm gonna have you arrested for trespassing. I'm sure you know how it disgusts me to set foot on your proprety and see your face. But I believe that my grandson and your niece might be in danger. It's preposterous. My niece is upstairs and she is in bed. Is she? Why don't you check? Mary Alice? Mary Alice, come to us. Talk to us. We want to help you. She's not there. And her window was wide open. She must have climbed out. For the sake of the children we must put away our differences and find them. It must not happen again, Ellicott. Mary Alice? Please. She's not coming, Katherine. She's got to. - You don't know that. Maybe Professor Twyman was wrong Maybe she's just a residual haunting. Just an echo and can't hear or see us - No, Ben. She can. I know she can. You have to believe. You have to. Do you feel that? Do you? Yeah - She's coming, Ben. I can feel that she's coming Blast it. We'll have to go on foot from here. Are you sure they're here? - I'm positive. Mary Alice? We're here for you. Mary Alice? Mary Alice, please? She's gone, Katherine. No, Ben. She's here. - You can feel it. She's not here. Why? Why would she just come and then leave? Mary Alice? Mary Alice? I thought - I know I know. I need to know there's more, Ben I just I need to know that my mom and dad are okay You just have to have faith that they are, Katherine. Why didn't they come back? Mary Alice could. They could. Why didn't they? Didn't they love me enough? Maybe they loved you too much. Maybe that's what it's all about. Knowing that. To move on. It's what's best for the people you love I just I miss them so much. Think about how they must miss you How it must pain them to see you hurt so much You owe it to them to live your life to the fullest, Katherine. 'Cause if you don't their lives won't have meant anything. Thank you. Hey What are boyfriends for? It's just my luck. You're leaving soon. Ellicott. She's here, Jason. - Who? Mary Alice. - Ellicott, you're hallucinating. I'm hurt. My leg might be broken. I need help. Didn't you hear her? You didn't see her? I see nothing. Mary Alice? Come back! Come back! Come back! Oh, man. Grandfather! Ben My cellular phone is somewhere down there. How are you, Uncle? You're okay? - Oh, yes. Yes. Thank God that tombstone broke the fall of this branch. It looks lot worse than it is. There's been an accident in the Wickwire Cemetery. - Always an optimist, aren't you? A tree fell on my grandfather and another man Thank you. They're on their way. Was it how you described the night you killed my sister? It looks worse than it is. - Jason No! The children want to know everything. How it all happened. Nothing is sacred. Let us talk about it, Ellicott. Let us talk. Tell your niece Tell her how you killed Mary Alice. Jason Please. Stop. Mary Alice! Stop hating, Jason. Please- Why? Why did you wait so long? Everyone else has seen you but me. Why? - You hardened your heart, Jason. You let no one in. Not even your wife and your child. You couldn't see me because you couldn't believe in the power of love. What about me? Mary Alice, what about me? I loved you more than life. Why didn't you come to me? You you were too blinded by hate and regret, Ellicott. I tried to make you see, but both your hearts were too hard and couldn't speak before the two of you were together again. He took you from me. - No! He did not take me from you. He did not take me from you. It was you, Jason. It was not my fault. - It was no one's fault Remember that day Ellicott and I wanted to elope. I was so happy. I couldn't wait to tell you, Jason. But when I did you became angry. We argued terribly. I had no objections to the marriage. I only wanted that father and mother come back from Europe and give their blessing. I was of age, Jason Ellicott was like a brother to you. We felt we needed no one's blessing but yours. I ran to the Winslowes to join him. At least he could've acted as a man and come and get you? You would not have been walking down that road He didn't even know I was coming, Jason. Because without your blessing he refused to elope. So it was your fault. - No. I was nearing the road when I stopped I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to wait another day to marry you, Ellicott. But I realized how much pain that could cause. So I decided to turn back. That's when I saw it. A deer out on the road A truck was coming. NO! It was terrified. Paralyzed. I had to try to save it. So you see it was no one's fault. It is within you both to give me the peace I crave Forgive one another I am sorry Ellicott. Thank you for believing. Thank you. Good-bye. Good-bye. Father? Father! Thad? I'm here. Father. Are you all right? I'm fine. Just fine. Oh, Ben. What have you done? Your grandfather could have been killed. On the contrary, Meredith If it weren't for Ben, I might not have lived. Ben do you have any idea the trouble that you have caused? There are more important things in this world than you There shouldn't be at least not in your world. I don't need your advice on raising my son, father. I'm sure you think you don't. - I don't think it. I know it. Thad I freely admit I was not a very good father. I apologize for that. I probably will apologize for that every day for the rest of my life, but I cannot undo what I did. I'd like to keep Ben here with me. Moreover, I'd like you to come home as well- To be a family. D'you honestly believe that after all these years and the neglect your absence that you can just snap your fingers and transform you and I into a normal family? No. - But I think that I can do it for you and Ben. Ben is a very fine young man. Perhaps high-spirited sometimes, but I'm very proud of him. I love him. And I love you too. I know it's maybe too late for you and me but it's not too late for you and Ben. We're very tired from the flight and the time change. We need to lie down and. We'll talk after dinner. Come on, honey. It's more words than I've heard you speak since I got here. Do you think you got through to him? Time will tell. I will not give up. I'm meeting Katherine. I'll be back for dinner. Will you ask her to join us? - I will. Grandfather Thanks. Thank you, Ben. Ellicott? This is Jason. Oh, I feel much better, much better Ben is asking Katherine here for dinner. Would you join us? I have a little something to give you. 7 o'clock. Wonderful See you then. Hey? - Hey Did you get any sleep? Not much I was keeping an eye on Uncle Ellicott. How are your parents? - Hm, they're still my parents. But I have high hopes for them. I was wondering maybe we could write to each other if you wanted to. Oh I don't know. I'm not much of a writer. Um okay. Whatever. And besides, you know, long distance relationships are just doomed to fail anyway. Right. - But none of that matter because if I want to see you I'll just walk over. What? - I'm not leaving. I'm staying at Wickwire. You, jerk. - Well, if you'd rather I'd leave - No, no no. Hey. Why don't we go back to my house? Okay. You know and I've been thinking: we're getting pretty gooc at this ghost hunting. Uh no. No way. I had enough with ghosts. Did you feel that? - Yeah, it was weird. It was like a cold breeze. Ben, are you trying to - No! I swear! Because if you are, it's not working.
