I have a priority package from the NATSAT printing room. Why don't you say it a little louder? We could open the window. You could shout it towards Moscow. Sorry. l.... It's not your fault you're stupid. - Just open the case and get out of here. - The case is chained to my wrist... and security dispatch has the key. Well, than leave the material, take the case, and wait outside. No can do, sir. The material is locked to the interior of the case. All right. Just give it to me. Get in the closet. Hi-Weather lV transmitted this stuff an hour ago. Beautiful close-ups! Miegs and Sline will drool. They're late again. Unusual for soldiers. They know what they're doing. - Gentlemen. - Here they are. - Are those the shots from the latest fly-by? - Over here, general. Wait. Is someone in this closet? - lgnore him. - He's just one of our couriers. Oh. Okay. Nice close-ups. Definitely approaching full-go hour. I greased the House Committee for covert appropriations. They think the funds are for more stealth bombers. We've selected two GLG-20s. They're the best men we have. The last two were the best men we had. Now they're the two best dead men we have. I'm convinced there's a security leak in your training program. - Well, we could bypass training. - No. They'll go through training. But with four other GLG-20s... two who are responsible for the project and two who are... disposable. Are you suggesting we assign this job to inferior personnel? No, no, I understand. Two teams. One to do the job, the other to be a diversion. - You mean decoys? Targets? - Exactly. GLG-20s don't exactly grow on trees. I'd hate to waste two of them as targets. I'm sure you can find a couple of men you won't mind wasting. ♪ I'LL BE ♪ WHEN? ♪ LOVIN' YOU ♪ ♪ CLOUDY DAYS OR SUNNY ♪ ♪ LOVIN' YOU ♪ ♪ ARE YOU SURE? ♪ ♪ THAT'S A PROMISE, HONEY ? ♪ WHEN YOUR KISS CAN NO LONGER PACK A THRILL ♪ NOTHIN'. ♪ I'LL STILL BE LOVIN' YOU ♪ ♪ I'LL BE HUGGIN' YOU ♪ ♪ HOW? ♪ ♪ LIKE A BABY PANDA, KISSIN' YOU ♪ ♪ WHERE? ♪ ♪ ON YOUR OLD VERANDA ♪ ♪ WHEN YOUR CHARM, DEAR, IS ABSOLUTELY NIL ♪ YEAH, I KNOW.

Look at these samples. All multiple choice. It's easy. Here. "If discovered appropriating classified documents at a foreign consulate reception... you should A, express concern. B, act surprised.

I was born into the trade. Besides, l've arranged for an intimate lunch with our supervisor. Fitz, you have to take that test. I'm very hurt that's why you invited me over here today. Oh, come on.

Was it fixed? Yeah, with new voice scramblers and everything. Huh. What about that red-Chinese radio chatter? It's done. - Here you go. - Done? It was a static-filled, triple-scrambled microwave transmission... between two soldiers talking in Mandarin Chinese. The Chinese were only using a simple polyphonetically grouped 20-digit key... transposed in boustrophendonic form with multiple nulls. I broke it with this. A Drogan's decoder wheel? They put these into cereal boxes for kids. Yeah, l found it in a box of... Lucky Charms. - Break it down again with the machines! - l already did. Well, then... clean up the desk! Good. That's much better. Oh, yeah. By the way, good luck on the test tomorrow. - Test. What test? - The Foreign Service Board exams. Good luck. Foreign Service Boards, tomorrow? I can't take that test tomorrow. I haven't studied. l'm not prepared. You were bumped up on the list. You're scheduled for tomorrow morning. I'm sure l told you. This is dated two weeks ago. You planned this. You want me to fail that test so you can keep me... down here in the center of the earth doing your work for you. You just watch your mouth, mister. This department's laying off civilians left and right. - Where you going? - Home. To study. Ha. One night studying for a grade-19 FSB exam? - Good luck. - Listen, captain. I'm going to pass that exam, and l'm going to get out of this hole... and do some really important work for national security. Yeah, sure. I was going to do your family a favor and hook up the Disney Channel... for free. Well, forget it. Ladies and gentlemen... as of this afternoon, the undersecretary for South American affairs... emphatically denies any and all intervention... in the current realignment of top positions of the Paraguayan Air Force. Thank you very much. What about the Paraguayan army's request for spraying subsidies? Are there any Paraguayans here? No? Of course. Their request for subsidies was not Paraguayan, as it were. The United States gover... would never... The president, our president, had not. As far as l know, that's how it'll always be. Is that clear? [TALKlNG OVER EACH OTHER] How can you say we aren't spending millions on spraying... when the International Wheat Board has reported... and l quote, "Extensive contamination in the grain fields of southern Argentina"?

[ALL CLAMORING] These examinations are qualifiers for positions... in the intelligence sections of our embassies overseas. The nature of your postings will be secret. Now, secret work can be very risky. I cite as an example what happened to to one of our greatest Americans... Not yet! - Oh. I'm sorry. - Excuse me. - I'm sorry. - My fault. [WOMAN CLEARS THROAT] Mm.... I'm sorry I'm late. I had to attend the reading of a will. I had to stay to the very end. I found out I received nothing. Broke my arm. [COUGHS] Oh, uh....

He's a repair supervisor in DlA's code-breaking arm at the Pentagon. Wiggled into supervisor's pay through an F-section. His last job before joining Defense was fixing office copiers. He's good with hardware, got some Russian. Want to see their test scores? What the hell for? They're a couple of absolutely self- involved bullshit artists... who got caught cheating on a departmental exam. They'll do anything to save their jobs. One's got basic diplomacy skills. The other's a code-breaker with language ability. I believe we've found our decoys. Uhn. Heart attack! Can l borrow your pen? All right, everybody, please stand back! l'm a trained cardiovascular respiratory emergency assist technician. I want all of you to stand back! This man needs air! In fact, all of you should leave the room... Well? So, what are we gonna get? Dismissal? Suspension? Censure? Departmental prosecution? What? Promotion. - What? - That's right. We like what we've seen in you two, guys. We're bucking you right up front to gathering. Level 20. Gathering, level 20? That's quite a step up in base pay. You mean, we're not in trouble? We're not recruiting for the Boy Scouts. We want people who are aggressive... who know how to go after that little edge that you need to survive. And we especially liked the way you two guys were working as a team in there. Now, if you feel you can work together, you're on your way up. We've got a very special assignment for you two. - Foreign service? - Yes. - Undercover work? - Yes. - Emmett Fitz-Hume. - Austin Millbarge. - When do we begin our training? - Right away. Boy! We're just hitching a ride with this guys. They won't make us jump. Jump? No chance. We won't have to jump. All right, Sky-troopers! Let's go! Let's go! Go? What does he mean, go? Come on, come on. You can't do this! What are you doing? Aaah! Fitz-Hume! Help! Help! Ooh! Help! Help! Help! Help! - Where are we? - l don't know. I wasn't watching. I lost everything at 7,000 feet. - You hear that? - Yeah. It's a dickfer. - What's a dickfer? - To pee with. Was that me? - We need a plan. - Let's play dead. - Come on, superspy, think of something. - You're the diplomat. Talk to them. All right. Stop right there, and l'll bring back the sun. Okay? This is my sister. You can all have her. I hear she's very good. - Just take another step, and l start swinging! - You heard that? He's threatening you! Let's get him! - For God's sake. Show some balls! - I think it's too late to try to impress them. That's enough. - Austin Millbarge? - Here, sir. Emmett Fitz-Hume. Hello. Sir. Colonel Rhombus, Special Projects Training. We've been expecting you. Excuse me, sir but what was all this...? That's how l welcome new trainees. What's wrong with a hot cup of coffee and a handshake? This is my job to get you prepared to go out into the field for combat. I must know right away what I've got to work with. I've made my decision. - What's it say? - Pussy. I don't think that's vary fair. All this guys had swords. What are we supposed to do? It depends on your particular arena of combat. Maybe this. Oh! I'll take you back to the base. Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! This is the obstacle course. It's the course familiar to armed service recruits. Except that here in Intelligence Operative Training... we do it a bit differently. We add the element of scorched earth. This is your standard bog negotiation trial. You'll be judged on survivability and time. Enter... now! Ow! Ow! Ow! - Heads down! - Hah! Oh! This will verify your ability to stay afloat at high speeds. We'll now begin with AFPSR... air force passive strain response. You are not required to exert yourself at all. Only to survive aggravated body temperature measurement. - Whoa! Ooh! - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Hot! Hot! Hot! We'll now determine your G-force threshold. Just relax, gentlemen. - l guess we just sit here? - Piece of cake. - You want some coffee? - That's a good idea. Huh. Colonel, we were just talking.... We've had loads of fun here. And, you know, we met new friends... and had a great lunch. Was it a great lunch, right? Yeah, the tuna and cream casserole was beautiful. Anyway, we were just talking and we'd like to go home now. So, thanks for the bruises, and you can keep the stool samples. Boys, it would be a shame to have to kill you now. - What did he mean by that? - Means we're OlO. What's that? Obligated Involuntary Officers. Gentlemen, begin radical vertical impact simulation... now. Come in. You wanted to see us, sir? Sit. Congratulations, men. You're about to enter the operational phase of your assignment. I'm not authorized to give you the full operational package... but l will tell you the location of your initial drop will be well inside the borders of Pakistan. - Pakistan? - Pakistan? Is one of these people our contact? Okay. Who led the American League in home runs in 1953? I'll handle this. - What's he doing? - That's just their way of saying hello. Hello. I'm Austin. Hi. Bud Schnelker, liaison office. U.S. consulate, Karachi. Rob Hodges. DIA, West Asian section. Welcome to Pakistan. Boy, you don't know how glad we are to see you guys. - When's lunch? - Come on, guys. Jeep's over here. I'm starving. What time you got? Hey, listen. Could we stop? - What's the matter? - l gotta take a leak. You should go too. What are you, my mother? Don't you think l'm capable of determining my own time to go to the bathroom? So, isn't now one of those times? No. You mean you don't feel a certain degree of urgent pressure on the inner wall of your bladder... now, right at this moment? - No. I'm fine. Wouldn't you feel more comfortable being fully relieved... of any excess fluids that might be building up, immediately, right now? I got to take a whiz? - Don't go away. - We'll be here. These guys are not our legitimate contacts. These guys are KGB special branch. - Come on. - Oh, don't tell me to come on. That was a Russian wristwatch. I know the country of origin of every timepiece in the world. That was a Russian copy of a 1969 Timex digital. What is this some kind of a hobby with you? Basic. Most common slip-up in espionage. We walked right into enemy hands. - Hi. - Just between us... if you do know your final objective... you'd be smart to tell us. We could probably work things out a lot quicker for you. Well, like he said, we still don't know. You know what they say about this type of operation: "Chem menshe znayesh, tem luchshe". (less you know, better for you) Da, da... da. (yes, yes... yes) - Feet. - Hat. Come on! Look out! - They sure had me fooled. - The Soviets obviously know we're here now. - Where to, boss? - First we have to check our gasoline supply. - Ok. How's our gasoline supply? - Eight 5-gallon cans. - That enough to get us to an airport? - l hope so. We'll do driving in shifts. One guy'll drive, the other'll sleep. Ok. I'll drive, you sleep. - Wake me up when you get tired. - Okay. - Good night. - Good night. - Sleep tight. - Thanks. - Don't let the bedbugs bite. - Okay. Night. Good morning. ls there an airport near here? Austin. Your turn to drive. These are the Yusufzai. They're Afghani freedom-fighters. They're our allies. Oh! We're Americans! Dr. Hadley! Oh, my God! What do you think you're doing? Sorry about this. They're very distrustful of outsiders. - No problem. - Get your men to cut them down. - Who are you? - Oh, sorry. Hadley, London College of Medicine. They only allow us here because we're helping with the wounded. - They didn't realize you were with the effort. - With who? The United Nations medical effort, of course. Aren't you Drs. Trowbridge and Greenberg? Doctors? Yeah, sure. That's us. Uh- huh. We're doctors. I'm Dr. Trowbridge. This is Dr.... - Greenbaum. - Berg. Greenbaumberg. We're doctors. Everybody looks fine here. What do you say, doctor? I say yes, doctor. Stick your tongue out, please. Everything's fine. I guess we'll be heading back to the old U.N. And of course we'll let them know what a good job you're doing here. The American sense of humor. Come on. The others are anxious to meet you. Have we received the last shipment of penicillin yet? - Not yet, no. - Possibly tomorrow. Two envoys are coming. Ah. Here we are. I'm Hadley, Internal Medicine. Dr. La Fong, Communicable Diseases. Dr. Boyer, Bacteriology. Doctors Stinson, Marston, and Gill of Northampton Trauma lnstitute. And Dr. lmhaus of the Zurich Relief Fund. These are our newly arrived surgeons, Trowbridge and Greenbaum. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. Doctor. - And, doctor. - Did we miss anyone? Why don't you gentlemen relax. The tribe's planning a raid on a Soviet tank division tomorrow. There will be plenty for us to do then. Doctors. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. - Doctor. We're not doctors. We've got to get out of this place, immediately, if not sooner. - No. Not until I've had... - Excuse me. Her. - Am I interrupting? - No! Not at all. He was just on his way out. What happens when the real Brownbridge and Greenbridge come? - Dr. Trowbridge. - Where? Oh! Right. - Make yourself comfortable. Sit down. - Thank you. What can I do for you? Dr. Trowbridge... May I call you Homer? - Why? - Well, that's your name. Oh! Right! Homer. Of course. What's your name? - Karen. - Karen. Dr. Trowbridge... Homer, when you walked into this tent... it was the most exciting moment of my life. Well, you just wait. You're a hero of mine. I've read all your papers. How did you get my papers? Oh, you mean my medical papers. Right. - Are you making fun of me? - Oh, Karen. Our first fight. You might think l'm silly to worship you the way l do... but in my estimation, you're a genius. "Genius" is a pretty strong word, but if you insist on using it... l can handle it. In fact, I hesitate to mention my problem. It's a task hardly worthy of your abilities. No. Go ahead and mention it, really. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. It's the khan's brother. He's been suffering from pain in the right lower abdomen. - Obviously an inflamed appendix. - Obviously. Dr. Hadley was going to remove it, but now that you're here... I mean, just to see you perform even the most simple surgery... would be one of the great thrills of my life. I'd really rather not. I don't have my instruments with me. Ahem. Use Dr. Hadley's. Please, Homer. The khan's brother is being prepped now. If you refuse to do this... the khan will lose faith in you, and us. The consequences could be severe. I see. Well... The truth is l am a great surgeon. But, alas, l recently suffered severe nerve damage in my left hand. Oh, my God! Look at that. No feeling at all. Dead. - How did that happen? - l was lifting a car off a child. It was a big car, a Cadillac. I'm so disappointed. And the khan, he'll be very suspicious. - My God. - Oh, there, there, there. You know. Actually, I could operate without my hands. Dr. Greenbaum could be my hands. I could tell him what to do, and he'd do it for me. - Then you'd get a chance see me in action. - That would be wonderful. Of course, after I guide Dr. Greenbaum through an operation, I get very depressed... because I couldn't do it myself. You know. It's a very bad time for me. Don't you worry. I'll be with you. Give me a break. About an hour? Fine. An hour. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. You're good with tools, aren't you? Devices, instruments? What? You kidding? You're talking to Millbarge here. You want something converted, built, repaired, modified. You're talking to Mr. Hands. Ah. Oh. Mind if I play through? Doctor. Doctor. Ha. Glad I'm not sick. If anything happens to him, my people will be angry. To die in battle is glorious. To die in a tent is disgrace. And with that, I give you Dr. Julius Greenbaum. Thank you, doctor. I'll just step out for a smoke. Perhaps I'll stay here. Heh- heh. Today we will be removing the patient's appendix. The first step in an operation of this particular type is... to shave the patient. Ah. Forget it, get on with it. We'll skip the shave and go directly to the operation. The second step in an operation of this type is... anesthetic. But can't you tell? He's already been given the required injection of Pentothal. Of course. He's already been given the required... injections. All right. Let us begin the operation. Thank you, doctor. And now, the first incision. Doctor. Isn't that incision a bit high for an appendix? Do you wanna do the operation? Fine. You come on up here, and you do it. - lmhaus. - He was cutting into his chest! Did you see me cut into his chest? Did I cut his chest? I was probing to determine muscle tone and skeletal girth. It's a new technique. - We mock what we don't understand. - Yeah. Go ahead, will you? I'm getting hungry. And now, the first incision. And now, l will incise. Cut the sucker. This man is dead. Whoa! Excuse us. Thank you. Whoa- oh! Ah! Let me do it! Emmett! Help me! Let go! Yaah! The drive-in is closed. We're with the Ace Tomato Company. All this cloak and dagger stuff. The military love it. Christ, will you look at this place? - Mr. Ruby. - Sir. Mr. Keyes. - Yes, sir. - Won't you gentlemen have a Pepsi? Two Pepsis to go. Now what? "Why don't you gentlemen have a Pepsi?" You do it. This way, gentlemen. Welcome to W.A.M.P. - General Sline, sir. - Yes, sergeant? It's a collect call from Pakistan for Mr. Ruby. - A Mr. Fitz-Hume. - Ah! What? Folks, sorry. We'll just be another minute. Thank you for your patience. It's person to person, sir, collect. They said their contacts tried to kill them and they don't know what to do. And they told you this over a public phone? No, sir, the AT&T operator told our operator. - They're insane. - And apparently roaming free. He's on line seven, sir. Get us the hell out of here! Everything's under control, Mr. Fitz-Hume. Hold on one moment. Look, the longer we keep them out in the field... the more heat we can draw away from the real team. I agree. Let's send them over the border. - How do they get there? - That's their problem. Hello, gentlemen. Listen, we are organizing a rescue operation for you. For after you've reached your final objective. What is our final objective? Information like that is given out on a need-to-know basis only. And at this particular time, you do not need to know. However, we can tell you to make immediately... for the Soviet Pamir District. Wait for your next contact on the road to Dushanbe. The road to Dushanbe? You practically told them the strike zone. Listen. Even if they make it there at all... they'll be plucked by Soviet motorized infantry. The road to Dushanbe is a heavily traveled military artery. I guess that takes care of that. We must make no mistakes this time. Our whole way of life hangs in the balance, gentlemen. Pamir? Dushanbe? - You're sure that's what he said? - Right. - Those places are in Russia, are they? - And how. No, thanks. I've already eaten. How can we get there? It must be 1000 miles from here. Actually, if this is the lower Kohistan district... we're only about 150 miles from the Soviet border. You would have to know that. Wait a minute. The Soviet border? How do we get across the Soviet border? We don't shave, sell the ambulance... sell our clothes, and go native. How far do we have to go on this bus? As far as it takes us. Hey, look! lt's Dr. Boyer! She's the last person we want to see. No, she's nice. - ls this the border? - No. Toll stop. Hopefully, there won't be any guard posts where we're gonna cross. Look. Dr. Boyer. Leave it alone. I left without saying goodbye. Can you ever forgive me? Where are you going? You can't deny what happened back there between us. Don't touch me. Come on. Hyah! "Don't touch me." Look at this. This is really neat. 00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:09,277 How do you like that? She lets a little thing like death get in away with romance. They couldn't have done any better with the khan's brother then we did. They aren't doctors. What do you mean? That metal case she was packing on her horse. - What about it? - lt's a Satscrambler terminal. Sophisticated system for sending, scrambling... receiving and unscrambling satellite messages. So she's a sophisticated woman. It's a highly classified piece of intelligence hardware. - So she's a high-class intelligent piece. - Come on, knock it off. Well, what are you saying? That they're spies like us? They're spies, but not necessarily on our side. I think it's our duty as American operatives... to follow her and find out what she's up to. - You just want to follow her. - No. You're thinking with your dick. They left their Land Rover here. They're probably headed right for the border at some secret point. It would save us a lot of trouble. They do seem to be headed in that general direction. - Maybe your dick's not so dumb. - Got me through high school. Do you think those men are following us? They're most likely Chitrali nomads. Not to worry. - Did you say sit? - l didn't say sit. - Did you say sit? - No, I didn't say sit. What... ? Now what? I guess we walk. Why do we have to carry all this stuff? The Dushanbe road runs across the top of the Pamir mountains, the roof of the world. It'll be sub-arctic temperatures up there, freezing. You'll thank me. "You'll thank me." That's it. The Dushanbe road... where we're supposed to meet our contacts. l hope. Only in so far as it serves to confirm the president's own beliefs. This is quite an exciting project you've got here, general. What was the cost of this Star Wars system? - Just under 60 billion. - Quite a bargain. Sir. Printout from Gravsat. Let's see. A transmission from the field, your GLG-20s. Well, wonderful. They confirm estimated arrival... at the strike site by 6 p.m. their time tomorrow. That's 9 a.m. here. Right on schedule. You can always count on our people. Well, this is it. Where are those contacts we heard so much about? Didn't exactly say where on the road, did they? No. Maybe we should start hitchhiking. We're inside the Soviet Union. - l wish we hadn't lost Boyer. - They were on horseback. We were on foot! [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] It's the Tadzhik highway patrol. [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] They were just sitting there in the dark. They heard our entire conversation. [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] What are they saying? He says we needn't bother whispering anymore. Come on, let's get out of here. - What do you mean. We try that, they'll cut us down. - We can't just go with them. What other choice do we have? If we give ourselves up, the state department can work out an exchange... to get us home. - Not me! [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] Hi! Just me. [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] [SHOUTS IN RUSSlAN] I was just looking for the Burt Reynolds Theater. [SHOUTS IN RUSSlAN] Don't l get a phone call? And who do you intend to call? Goddamn it. He gives himself up. - What's your objective? - My objective? I object to taking a girl out and buying her dinner and then she won't put out for you. - Why are you here? - Why am l here? Why are you here? Why is anybody here? I think it was Jean-Paul Sartre who said.... How do you spell Sartre? Ow! And let that be a lesson to you! Every minute you don't tell us why you're here... l cut off a finger. - Mine or yours? - Yours. Damn! Oh! Why are you still hitting me? He's gonna cut my fingers off. - You have 30 seconds. - You're not gonna start hum the Jeopardy theme? We start with the little one. All right. All right. I'm an American agent. And...? And, uh.... They sent me here to assassinate your premier. - l knew it! Pay up comrad. - Let's cut his fingers off anyway. No. Let's take him back to headquarters in Moscow. Good move. Good move. Headquarters. It shouldn't be much further now. We've made good time. We'll go on foot from here. [SHOUTS IN RUSSlAN] Oh. Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Goddamn it! Huh? Huh! Ah! Oh! Oh! Whoa! Hi. Heh-heh-heh. How you doing? Remember me? - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? They surprised us. Border troops. They got my partner. - Did they get you too? - l'm fine! No wonder neither of you could do that appendix operation. You're spies like us! - You mean you're... ? - Austin Millbarge. l'm a GLG-20. So... you two are the other GLG-20s. The decoys! - Decoys?! - Lower your voice. That's why they rushed us through training, why we were met by the KGB... why they sent us into enemy hands. - Right. I am extremely pissed off. My partner and l were set up. Forget it, that's behind us. Our first priority is to cover those bodies... establish a new base camp and complete this project. Project? Listen. Fitz-Hume is in the custody of the Tadzhik highway patrol because of you. The only project l have to complete is to get my partner out. Fitz-Hume! Fitz-Hume! Come on! Ah! Oh! - Look at this. Did you do that? - Yeah, I did that for you. [SHOUTS IN RUSSlAN] [SPEAKING IN RUSSlAN] You know, I must really like you because I don't like horses and l hate guns. [SHOUTING IN RUSSlAN] - What's this? - You don't want it! Duck! I'll get the horse. Let's go! Hi-yo, Silver! Away! Hah! [THE BAR-KAYS'"SOUL FlNGER" PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS] It's "Soul Finger" by the Bar-kays. They must be having trouble getting gigs. Wow. This is a Soviet ICBM site. That's an SS-50 long-range rocket and mobile launcher. They just moved it in here. Haven't even put up their locator beacon. Means they're not hooked in to Soviet defense chain. They are radio-isolated. Only three men. [SPEAKING IN RUSSlAN] And their mother. Oh! Let me see that. Come on! Honestly. You two are unbelievable. - Wait a minute. What are we doing here? - This is our final objective. Our project orders are to subdue the crew and seize control of this emplacement. Hold it, sister. We're not going near that thing. That missile is tipped with... a 40-megaton fishing fusion nuclear warhead. - Good night, everybody. - Where are you going? - Home. For once, l am in complete agreement with my friend here. We should all get up and leave this place immediately. You know what those things can do? Suck the paint off your house and give your family a permanent orange Afro. I don't care what you two do, but I'm fulfilling my obligation. I intend to go down there and seize control of that emplacement alone if I have to. Oh no, now, wait a minute. You know we'd do anything for you, but we can't go down there and seize that rocket. - We'd have to kill everybody down there. - And I'm not killing anybody. I'm not either. Gentlemen, l think you both should realize the gravity of this moment. I've spent the last two and a half years of my life preparing for this penetration. This afternoon l buried my partner, Jerry Hadley... perhaps the finest, most dedicated GLG-20 in the history of the service. He is now forever entombed in a snowy grave. And it's not going to be for nothing! We are here today to guarantee the personal freedom of every American. And we should never forget the words of President John F. Kennedy, who said: "Ask not what your country can do for you... but what you can do for your country." Will you marry me? Now.... These are high-compression tranquilizer pistols. We're not going to kill anybody... but you've got to get in close to use them. Hours, T-minus two until designated target apogee. Sir, all air traffic has been diverted from our response corridor. What's our present on-line power reading? Michigan reactor and Washington State atomic plants on-line, general. Lock us in, sergeant. W.A.M.P. secure, sir. All right. Let's go to response level Yellow. Initiating level Yellow. Run your full servo and arming. Servo on and armed. [SPEAKING IN RUSSlAN] "Soul Finger." [THE BAR- KAYS'"SOUL FlNGER" PLAYS] "Soul Finger." [SPEAKING IN RUSSlAN] What's she saying? Hair.... Hairbrush.... Headrest. Jesus, where'd you learn your Russian, J.C. Penney? [SPEAKING IN RUSSlAN] When she was a child in Lithuania, her uncle used to tell a story... about strange beings that came down from a disk and stole an ox... which the village had put aside for roasting. I told you it would work. Everybody knows about UFOs. Apparently the aliens from the silver disk dissected the ox... and kept the best pieces of meat for themselves. So what? So we owe them a cow. Where do we get one? [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] Do what I do. Satscram signal from the strike site. Your GLG-20s have penetrated successfully and are awaiting the go-code. Open and lock down ground deflectors. Ground deflectors opened and locked. - Okay, Dostoyevsky, what does it say? - lt says: "Approach SS-50... source programmable rocket." Easy. "Find control box at front of transporter." This is a snap. "For erector panel, push red button." "Depress red key switch. - Enter first numbered sequence." - Go. "Three- three-nine... dash two-five-nine... dash six. Acknowledge compliance on Satscram now." GLG-20s acknowledge programming and compliance. Bring all birds into final bounce mode. Bounce mode engaged. Send them the go-code. "Go with numbered sequence, seven-four... dash seven-four... dash eight-eight-three... dash five, dash three." [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] SAC-COM confirms an outbound blip from Soviet Central Asia. It's on its way. Override all SAC alerts with stand-down orders for 10 minutes. SAC override code, entered. Error. Stand down. I think we just started World War lIl. [SPEAKING IN RUSSlAN] She wants to know why we would do such a thing. Tell her so do we. [SPEAKING IN RUSSlAN] - What are they saying? - lt's 4:47 a.m. They're saying it'll be 28 minutes before the rocket detonates above its target... somewhere inside the continental United States. Let's see, 28 minutes. That's 18 until it's inside the U.S. radar cup. Figure two for our response, say 20 until total commitment. Figure 20, 22 until the first impact of our retaliatory strike. I figure we have 42 minutes until the end of civilization as we know it. - You want to go out with a bang? - l beg your pardon? Just an idea. You know, if we were sitting in a bar, I'd throw a drink right in your face. But under the circumstances... it's not such a bad idea. [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] Release full pulse. Three... two... one. Mark. Bounce pulse failed to connect with target, sir. - Just what are you saying, soldier? - We missed it, sir. - What? - We missed the rocket. lt didn't work. Didn't work? Where did the pulse go? Don't know, sir, but it definitely didn't connect with the inbound traffic. - Wow. - Excellent! - We'd better call the president. - We're not calling anyone. What do you mean, we're not calling anyone? The president must know that this attack was not initiated by the Soviet Union. We are prepared for this contingency. What in hell do you intend to do? You understand, sir... that we are responsible for launching a nuclear weapon against our own country! No one outside this command center has that information, gentlemen. When we commissioned the Schmectel Corporation to research... this precise event-sequence scenario, it was determined... that the continual stockpiling and development of our nuclear arsenal... was becoming self- defeating. A weapon unused is a useless weapon. SAC-COM confirms. All defense systems commitment ready. We have verification. The president is aboard the airborne command center now. I'm sure it will only be a matter of minutes before the president commits to total release. Jesus Christ. You see, we had to show that we had the technical capability... and were determined. History demonstrates conclusively that naive wishing for peace... is the surest possible way to encourage an aggressor. I demand you place me in immediate communication with the president! Relax, Mr. Ruby. This facility is more than adequately stocked... for a comfortable 17 months of below-ground existence. We'll be fine. By your actions, sir, you are risking the future of the human race! To guarantee the American way of life... l'm willing to take that risk. Hard to believe it's been only 15 minutes since l destroyed the world. In another 15 minutes, it'll all be over. Such a short time to destroy a world. And to think my high school guidance counselor said l'd never amount to anything. It just goes to show... Guidance? Source Programmable guidance! Fitz-Hume! Boyer! Get up! Get up! Come on! Come on! Fitz-Hume! Boyer! [SPEAKS IN RUSSlAN] Wait a minute. What's going on here? - You have a tent? - Bring me the Satscram dish. I think we can recall it. What do you mean recall it? You mean like a defective Pinto? [SPEAKING IN RUSSlAN] Take this up. Up. Climb! Uh... [SPEAKING IN RUSSlAN] Grab a rock! Grab a hammer! We can divert it! It's made to respond to in-flight commands through their sat-relay network. - Here's a rock. - Go to the Satscram terminal. - Now what? - Smash that thing. - lt's broken. - Bring it here. Not the rock. What's the use? It's probably all over anyway. No, no, no. All we have to do is switch sending boards. Boyer, start sending the launch sequence in reverse order. Yes, sir. Fitz-Hume, hold these together. I've got to make the splice. Hold it together. - Ow! l got a shock. - And you will. I don't care how painful it is, you've got to hold them together. You are the circuit bridge. - But, but, but... - l need.... Bigger than a bread box? - l need.... - The title of a movie? Animals in their natural habitats? Book title? Things that are round? Things that are square. Things that are being electrocuted? - Got it! - Ah! Miles: Five... zero... zero... - We did it! - We did? We did it! Can l borrow your tent? SAC-COM confirms destruction of the inbound at Zulu 3000 hours. - What about the rest of their inbounds? - There are none, sir. Both the U.S. and Soviet response chain on full recall. Damn. Recall. - Place them under arrest. All of them. - Wait! - We don't know these men. - Oh! We were kidnapped! - That's right! Kidnapped! - We were! We were at the drive-in! As the disarmament talks here continue through closed sessions... last night and on into this afternoon, a feeling of positive anticipation... is shared by everyone in the press corps. The doors to the conference room are opening. l see the chief United States delegate, Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume. - Mr. Fitz-Hume. - Hi, Ed. Everybody at home is most anxious to know how things are going in there. Well, Ed, right now we're at an extremely sensitive juncture. And of course, the slightest misperceived phrase or gesture... could upset everything we've achieved today. - Now, if you'll excuse me, Ed. - Thank you, Mr. Fitz-Hume. Thank you, Ed. Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume, chief state department negotiator... here at the disarmament talks, re-entering what he has called... the "delicately balanced negotiations." Comrade! Okay. "What Little Richard song was the title of a 1950s movie... starring Jayne Mansfield?" "Good Golly Miss Molly"? "Great Balls of Fire"? Wrong! lt was "The Girl Can't Help lt." - Sorry. You lose. - Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe.
