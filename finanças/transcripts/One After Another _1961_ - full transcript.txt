RANZO JEFFERSON WHERE THE LAW IS NOT ENOUGH AMATEUR SUBTITLES * pistolero * Relax, senior. Do not be afraid. What do you want; We will go from the pasture. No one will bother you. Sorry, senior. A little topic. We have arrived, senior. Oh, you arrived! Look at him! What kind of face are these? You should be glad to see me again, Jefferson. You did not recognize me! Espartero! You have a very good memory, Colonel. Did n't that time be unforgettable for you? Come on, Amigo, sit next to me. You get out of here. Do not stand up. Sit on the pillow. In the seat of His Excellency! Come on guys, don't bother us anymore. I have time to see my friend. Leave everyone. Miguel, you stay. Go on stage, Pedro. I will come when I can. You have not changed at all. Your years have been given. I confess I'm glad to see you again, Colonel! It's not appropriate to call me that now. - The old days are over. - No, don't say that. Amigo, once a colonel ... ... forever colonel. Once a traitor ... ... forever a traitor. You got your share. A respectable amount. Do not forget it. Oh yes! Exactly! You betrayed the fort ... ... and I killed your soldiers. When we got here to share the money you got the most ... ... and I the least. No, senior! There are still people who want to kill you for it. However, if there is a disagreement , I have his signature! Not so fast, senior. What are the terms? Miguel ... ... he explained. My nephew speaks well. Kosmakis sells his land and his cows to survive. Ε, και; The money is in your bank and we will get it from there. My God, I can not do that. I am someone for the world of the city! He's right, Miguel. Do not forget that the colonel is honest. - Such a whole person does not steal. - Yes, of course. But with his sincere guidance we will get the gold. Definitely, with joy it will help. Yes, of course he will. The day after the robbery ... ... and after Miguel tells me that you collaborated ... ... you will get the contract. It is impossible to take such a risk. I do not know how to help. Then wait for Espartero to reveal it ... ... and everyone will learn that you betrayed your own men. You will not lose anything anyway. You have insured the money. You will take back the contract and we will all be happy. JEFFERSON BANK Good morning, Mr. Jefferson. Good morning, Ross. Mr. Jefferson ... ... the other employees you asked for will be here tomorrow. Thank you, Miguel. Now go inside to clean. Mr. Jefferson, I have registered gold deposits. - Thank you, Ross. - You are welcome. - Hands up. - Still and take out the shit. Whoever moves is dead. We must hurry! Keep it. Listen to me, you will not be able to break it. - In a minute the place ... - Stop and go back. Come on, hurry up. Throw away your weapons, bromomexics. Immobile, otherwise I will shoot. Both of you, come here. Move on. Go get help, Mr. Jefferson. I will keep them here. Give me the Ross weapon and disarm them. Take it. Jefferson, are you crazy? I saw you shot him! Everyone come here! - Come on, move. - We got it all, Jefferson. Quickly! Let us disappear! - Let's kick her out of here. - OK let's go. Untie the horses. They pop it! Fast, on horses. You will die for it, traitor! The contract! Jefferson! Jefferson! Call a doctor! He is still alive. It's empty! They got all the gold! Everything! Oh, my God! What misfortune befell us friends! They stole all our gold! The Cursed Mexicans! They all want to be hanged! Just relax, Mr. Jefferson. Do not move. Better to ... Better get it out! - Everything will be fine. - Miguel! - Calm down, Mr. Jefferson. I have to make sure ... May you rot in hell! He was shaken by the whole scene. Halt. This is the place. Let's hurry. Let's share the gold, boss! What's up with you? The gold will remain hidden as we planned. Remember they will be looking for suspects, Jefferson said. We must not risk it. Move now. We have to bury the gold, get rid of the Mexican rags ... ... and go back to the city before anyone hears us. Okay, hide it. Place the dynamite at the entrance. We will block it, go. The wick. Quick, out. Get covered. Half a minute, stranger. - Who you are; - I'm looking for Bill Ross. Ross? Office funerals May the Lord show mercy. Have mercy, Father, accept the soul of your slave ... ... who just left this useless world! Oh, Lord, lead him to a place of light, to a place of green, to a place of recreation ... ... where there is no pain, sorrow and sighing. And on the terrible day of Judgment ... ... lift him up to Your justice ... ... to receive his body to glory again. Who did it; He was shot by a Mexican gang. Was he your friend? Whiskey. What are you waiting for; The customer pays in advance. I will drink first to trust you ... ... and then you will trust me. Take. Put another one. Are you deaf? Relax, stranger. I will give you a little advice ... ...for your own sake. I hear. Do not provoke your luck because you will make me angry. I will be angry enough to break your glasses. Make it fast with whiskey. Put it on him too. If it's to listen to him, I better get him drunk. Leave me. You like to tell jokes, huh? Ate, Glenn, break them on the floor or give them back. Without them, the fukaras sees nothing! Hey, look! You also have reserves! I will arrange them very soon. Go back. Dangerous to walk here. The place is full of warlike customers. Someone may be hurt. What's the problem, sir? He did not want to drink with me. Who is the owner; It belongs to me. Bringing another brand of whiskey is disgusting. Well, I offer to treat you to good. Come and have a drink together. Okay. Two whiskeys. - What do they call you, stranger? - Stan. First, let's talk about it. $ 10.0000 the notice fee . - Who pays? - Me. Why; - I am the president of the bank and I want to catch him. - Understood. When did it happen? On Tuesday. I want the whole Mexican gang to be cleared. There are nine of them. The safe was full of gold from the big sale of cattle. How did they know? I made the mistake of hiring a poor Mexican out of compassion. I hired him for a job ... ... and ended up doing another. He stabbed me ... ... and betrayed me. That's why I pay generously for this Mexican. You want him alive ... ... or dead? It depends on you. Something else I need to know? Espartero did the job. The Mexicans are his. They hide in the mountains, you will easily find them. They are all murderers. So do not get caught. You will not stay alive for more than a minute. Do you want me to prepare a room for you? Beds are available. Are your beds better than your whiskey? - Do you want the Mexican? - Oh, yes! - Okay, I'll catch him. Make the money. - Good luck to you! - I will find your man. You can find even more. Stop, Pedro! You have to leave - It's late. - Do not be silly. Espartero will be missing for hours. You know he will kill me if he finds out. He will not suspect anything, he is too busy to notice it. You do not love me! I do not care about anything. I saw you with Carla. You also told her that you love her. You should not be jealous. You chose to live with another man. It's your business. I did not say anything. You know how much I love you, isn't it Pedro? No, to me that means nothing. I want your body next to mine and now that's what counts! - Not please! - Dog! You betrayed Espartero and I will never forget it, I swear to you. You know no one touches my wives. - Crush from here! - Not please... I will make you pay for it. Come out, slut! This is your gratitude! Do not try to hide. I'm going to see you! Go to my tent and I will show you how to behave. Go! Gringos spy! Go with me to Esparter. Of course, Americans, of course. We will take you to Espartero personally. E, Jose? Pedro, is a guest of Espartero. Make him feel comfortable. Upright, senior. Let me introduce myself to you. - I will teach you ways - No, Pedro, do not kill him. It is more useful to us alive. On the stage of Espartero, Ramon. I want to tell him what the Gringos said in the saloon. Let's go. You have a guest, Espartero. - Who is; - A stranger. Bring him in. I will finish with you later. Who is he? Hunter of bidders sent by the Gringos. I found this on him. This is what he wants. You are a brave man. You are wasting your time. We are innocent. My men did not rob the bank. I know who did the job. Mexicans, the whole city saw them. Very well. You just said it. You look like a Mexican, like Miguel. Others did the job. I tell you, I have nothing to do with robbery. Do you understand that? If you did not do it, why not find the others who did it? I could find those who robbed the bank. If I do, I will kill them like dogs. I will be happy to kill the scum. But first I have to find out where they hid the gold, before I do anything. Then they will pay me. And you will come with you. I promise only you and me. Think again, amigo. Is this the man in the poster? Yes, Miguel. He is my nephew. And on the morning of the robbery, the alleged Mexicans wounded him in the head. Since that day he has lost his voice and his memory. If I die, make those men regret that they robbed the bank. Shred them. Now go, amigo. When you come back, be sure that the gold is hidden. Do you agree, amigo? I do not know. Maybe you are not telling me the whole truth. Truth is more important than anything else. Maybe I can help you. Tell me your terms. I'm here to take this man to town ... - ... dead or alive. - Are you crazy? Or someone else who looks like him. Yes! No, Espartero, no. Pedro! No, no! Here, senior. Now you have what you need. Take him to the Gringos. He was a dirty beast. But now he paid for it. But, you said alive or dead. Yes, but he does not look like Miguel. I will do it, I will do it. Leave it to me. Tina, get out of there. Get out of there. Just push him into the fire and let him burn. No, no! Now he will look like him. With that, who will say that it is not Miguel? I caught your man. What happened to him? He was standing near the fire when I shot him. He did not give me another choice. - I brought you a job. - Thank you. No one can say you spent time. I only spend time with my money. I caught you". Come in and let me give you the money. They can wait. I'm tired right now. We will meet at the bar in the evening. Bring the money too. Get rid of my horse. Who is he? Ah, you! Close the door and enjoy. If you want, you can keep me company. You can get closer if you want. I must have got the wrong key. You were not wrong. Come on, wash my back. Come on, don't be ashamed! What's up? Wondering why your photo is on the pendant? Bill Ross gave it to me before he was killed. That's why I know you. What did he say about me? Nothing specific. Just what was waiting for you. Please, can you give me the towel? Thank you. Did you know Bill very well? He was excited to come. For sure. For a while ... better forget who I am. - Do you trust me? - It should; You can find out for yourself. What exactly do you want, Jefferson? I think we should hire him. It's what we need. I do not think so. He is very smart to command him. In my humble opinion, Jefferson. He brought one Mexican and he will bring the rest. I filed a report with the insurance company and it will send a researcher. Boys... ... if he notices something I will find my trouble. - How easy is it to learn? - Enough. We will relax only with all the Mexicans ... ... dead and buried. - We can do it. - I did not doubt it for a moment. Rest assured that they will pay for it. Nobody here has to worry. Better not to call the stranger. I guess Frank can do the job for you. He's definitely smarter than that guy. How did you kill those people in the bank? Think a little. Which of them lived to speak? You only have Espartero around your neck. You're going to handle things my way, aren't you, Glenn? But Espartero ... - ... only he knows you, Jefferson. - But I was not alone. You remember that; I will tell him who the others were. Starting with you. - I would not do it. - Calm down. Tell me, Jefferson. How will you approach your friend? I will not go alone. Together we will decide to do it. - How will you do it? - Scattering rumors around. Sowing hatred for Mexicans. This is what we will do. - We will set up a committee together. - You mean against Espartero? And then what will we do? We will make the move to become a friend. Spreading poison seeds. The stranger will do it. He will find their hideout. It must go down wherever it is. Let's go. Hello, Stan. Come down. You do not want; Whiskey. Did you bring me the notice fee? Do you want to increase them, Stan ?. For what job this time? What do you have in mind? We set up a committee to get justice, Stan. Commission to punish those killers. Glad to hear. So what should I do? Someone has to kill those dogs. Stan, we ask you. And the pay? For a start you will get 10,000. And so much more after. Okay. Have them ready tomorrow night. Wait, Espartero has a lot of killers. We could all do it together, if we rely on a plan. The man who worked at the bank ... ... the dead man I brought ... ... was Espartero's nephew. I think he will look for his body. You heard! I told you he is the man who will do the work for us. Sir, can I talk to you? Please! If you came to take my measures for the coffin you came very early. No, I'm not here for that. In fact, I offer you my services. Look, we could make some kind of deal. Your job is to kill people's funerals and mine. So what; I will give you 15% of each funeral. How about 20%? You will get your profit immediately. Okay, we agree. - Prepare nine. - Nine coffins? - I see you will keep me busy. - Yes. Yes, very busy. Thank you. Thank you! Nine! God bless you! Try something and the whole city will gather here. Do you want to kill hundreds? Ate, he shot. - Pull the trigger. - I will do it. Gringo, you are an idiot, since you went with Jefferson, who betrayed Espartero. This is what you did not tell me! Traitor, as you said. It does not concern you, gringo. But why did you sell your soul to Jefferson? If you try to catch the fish without bait on the hook ... ... the fish burst. I will drop the appropriate bait to reveal it. Bait for your friend Jefferson. - Explain better. - Do you suspect Jefferson set up the job. You just told me. The situation will be clarified wherever it is. Let's make a deal. I will bring them to the gorge. - With Jefferson. - Glad to kill the dogs, personally. You will not kill anyone. I will pass a beautiful noose around their necks. But how do we catch them if it is not to kill them? This is the gorge. Send your men to put explosives, here ... ... and here. When Jefferson and his men were among the explosives, he detonated them. This way they will be trapped. Very clever. You and I could be great partners. It is enough to do what I told you. Forget the rest. Mexicans are here. We will leave Miguel's body here. We will watch from an advantageous point in the gorge. Purposes will give the signal. We have to kill them before they understand us. We will attack from behind. Really admirable design. It's worth $ 20,000. People here will want to make you a sheriff. Glenn, what do you say? The only thing I am interested in is money ... ...and nothing else. Tomorrow morning ... ... I suggest you come out with me. Brilliant minds go together. Everything was arranged. For tomorrow. The dawn. Talk to Pablo. He is one of Espartero's men. You are one of them. How can I trust you? Look what he did to me. I hate him. I want to see him dead. You can leave now. Bring Pablo. Use a little persuasion. Make him talk. It is true what they say is going to lead them into the gorge ... ... to kill Mexicans? A beautiful woman thinks she is smart enough ... ... to think such things. Stan, please! Whatever you are thinking of doing, do not do it. I ask you for your own good. Think about it. Am I that important to you? Stan, do not be an idiot. You're an idiot; Why do not you talk; Come on, talk! So, Pablo ... ... you're a spy for Espartero, eh? Did it break? He is tough like all Mexicans. I have good news for you, amigo. I will burn both your eyes, if necessary. Well; Okay, you chose that. You're not going to enjoy this. You are very beautiful! - Will you give up your plan, Stan? - No. - Not even for me? - Not even for you. Then you do not love me. You could not! Good luck, Stan. Pablo! What is this? Pablo! Take it to Esparter! Τίνα... Espartero, I'm Stan. They are the inhabitants of the city. Not your Mexican friends. Are you happy now? He is a traitor. It does not work for us. And the Mexicans are here, aren't they? Attack the village. Kill them all. Let's go. So you lost your temper, huh? No more jokes. At least give us a smile. So you set an ambush for us! You will pay for what you did. This way you will not see the fists coming from you, you will only hear them! Your turn. Now, I want to ask you one last thing before I kill you. Pick up my cigar. Άντε! Hey, look, he found it! He is not so blind without glasses. Come on, get up and give it to me. Hurry up! It pops! He is hurt. He will not succeed in his condition. I will calm down until I see him dead. Go with me to Espartero. I want to talk to him. No, gringo. You will not talk to anyone again. Why did you come? To make sure your friends did a good job? Look what your killers did. I will send your soul to hell. Stop it, Louis. It is the gringo who betrayed us, Espartero. You must let me kill the beast. Do not believe what he tells you. He wants to deceive us. Wait, I want him to look me in the eyes. Oh my god! How could you; You betrayed me and condemned people to die. I tried to warn you but it was too late. Look around you to see the misery. The men were tortured to death and our women were killed! Even the children were slaughtered. They showed no mercy. They discovered the plan. They arrived before me. But if you think I betrayed you for the money ... ... I was not paid that well. Come on, do it. Do it, if you want. If you think I're a traitor, kill me. Well; You are the one who betrayed me! This is the proof. I found it in Pablo's hands. He held it when he died. Jefferson tortured him until he was forced to speak. Whoever owns the jewelry is the one who informed Jefferson. Tina! Come here! Come here, I said! Explain, Tina. You made a mistake killing Pedro! I wanted to kill you. And you gringo. As you burned his face, I wanted you to suffer. You deserved to suffer! All the men were killed and our women are dead. Young brothers and innocent children. So you justify your thirst for revenge? No never! I never thought ... May your soul burn forever in hell! I was crazy! I knew nothing about the attack! I was deceived! Please forgive me! I forgive you, Tina! Get it from here. Wait. Lie down alone, not with others. Forgive me. Forgive me, Gringo, for believing you were in charge. You are not going anywhere. Get out of my way, Mexican! Well; The men searched the area but did not find him. With such a wound he would not go far. - He must be dead. - You are probably right. The horse has blood everywhere. He is badly injured. The boys even searched the river. If he is not dead, he will not come here. People hate him. They will plant bullets in his head. We should not worry about a corpse. Isn't that how you feel? Keep your eyes open until we find out . Sorry, Sevina. What's up baby? Are you sorry he is dead? Maybe. You chose the wrong man, Sevi. Maybe you are just an unlucky woman. You loved two men. Both are dead. You can have me whenever you want. I intend to live for many years. Do it again and I will kill you. Lower the knife girl. If you want it, come and get it. - You're crazy, bitch! - Maybe! I do not know any more! - Stan! - Quiet! My back hurts from the kicks. Be careful! Oh, Stan, I was scared you were dead! I promised you I would come back. You are a target, everyone hates you. I have to regain my strength. You have to leave, Stan. I will not leave the city. Do you understand? You will be killed if you stay here. Go away. I will follow you. We will go far together. I will kill them all. One after the other. Then I will take you wherever you want. They have to die, do you understand? Do not worry Baby. Everything will be fine. Passed, gringo. Do not trust him, Espartero. Is not what you have done killer enough? - Go away! - Why did you come? To see your nephew. Miguel? Do not delude yourself, my friend. He may not be able to speak, but his arms are still strong. Miguel, I'm your friend. Miguel, do not be afraid. I want to help you. Remember that morning, Miguel? Remember! Who was in the bank? - Come on! - What are you doing? He was shot in the head during the robbery. You know the boy lost his memory. Cut it out! Miguel! Think, Miguel! The man who shot you. Did you see him? Who was he? Ate, Miguel, try to remember! I know it's hard for you to talk, but try! Try to remember the day of the robbery when you were shot. Tell me, who shot you? Remember that morning, Miguel! Remember! Answer me! Enough! Enough, I said. Get out of there. Stop torturing my poor boy. I mean it. Isn't it enough what Miguel has gone through? - Who was - Stop! - Who was! - I warn you! Take the road! Take the road! You are a beast! I'll kill you! Stay where you are! Look at the gun! Look at the gun! I mark you on the head. Who was it, Miguel? Who? I'll kill you, Jefferson! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Miguel! Miguel, you spoke! Get some rest. You need it. A miracle happened! - How to thank you! - You will be my witness. Thank you for that. I used to think you were human, Stan! I do not know how to repay it! I will be indebted to you forever! Me too, Stan. - What do you want? - Weren't you glad you saw me? Better not try something ... I just want to ask you a few questions, Herb. Then I'll send you back to your friends. I do not know anything! Let me go! - For you, Melanie! - Hello! I have not seen you for an hour! Go, I'm busy. He may have been caught by the Mexicans. He would definitely be here if something happened to him. Mexicans are a conjecture. It could be someone else. Who do you mean? Stan can be alive. Since we did not find his body it is a possibility. Forgive me, gentlemen. Forgive me. I stuck! Because they do not make the doors more spacious. I'm lucky it's empty! For half a minute. Oh, I did it! Go and take this thing with you. It was not my idea, Glenn. Someone outside told me to go ... to see better ... To Hood! - To me; - Yes, to you! - Who sent you? - I do not know. I do not like all this. It will be funny. Who sent you? Tell me! Tell me who sent you, if you want to live! Ate speak ... Hood! What dirty bastard did he? Who shot him? Someone would see him! Let's go look outside. Ah, my dear! Rest in Peace! Trent, Frank, with me. Bart, over there. Σταν! You did it. No one is going to sleep. And it is just the begining. - I will not sleep alone this morning. - You better go. - They went out with guns in their hands. - I will cause more confusion. Wait for me near the ruins, outside the city. I will arrive in about half an hour. Go. Hey, you, wait. What do you want? Didn't you see anyone? Here I mean. No one is here. But, very strange things are happening tonight, in the city. What sort of things; The man with the glasses, do you remember him? He asked me for nine coffins, not many, and I made them for him. I saw him again! Tonight; I buried him in the afternoon, along with the sweet lady. His soul left and after I returned ... ... I saw that someone had passed by and left me the price for a coffin. Then came a Mexican. He told me to make a coffin and take it to that man. I do not know what is happening around here. - I just do not know. - Surely you have never seen him? No no! Oh my God, it's the price for another coffin. Hey, what is this? First Hood ... ... now Bart. Now they enter the coffins alone! Trend! Trend! Strangeness! Nonsense. You heard the old undertaker. She never saw him again. Yes, if we found his body we would feel safer. The wind hits her. Open it. It's Trent! She killed him! Jefferson, I found this out! - It's Trent! - Calm down! - I hope I am not the next! - Shut up! It will surprise us all! We must stop the maniac before he kills us like the others. I hope he is not dead. I will arrange it myself tonight and I will bring his corpse. Stan; Stan! Stan! Oh, you did it! Εσύ! So he is alive! - You were waiting for him with so much anxiety. - No, Glenn. You should have been smarter. Now you can use it as bait. You have finally arrived! We started to worry that you had not returned yet. - Take it. - Are you sure no one followed you? - Where is Stan? - Here I am. Stan... ..everyone in the city knows you are alive ... ... and you plan to start Jefferson and his men one by one. You still have time to be saved. Now they are holding Sevina as bait to kill you. They think you will do anything to save her. So this is it; Do not you understand? It is a trap. But it remains to be seen who will end up in the trap. - No sign, Glenn. - Nothing. - Maybe it's early. - Will not come. He is not so stupid. - He will not fall into the trap. - The girl is here, don't forget it. We will end up dead, tonight! Let's leave Jefferson and go get the gold. Are you crazy; Where to go? If we break up this is the end. Don't you think we are better off with Jefferson? I was with Jefferson in the robbery. Now things are different. Hood, Bart, Trent, they are all dead. Do you want to see the rest of us dead like the others? I can not stay. Anyone else who wants to kick her? Go, but I warn you. It is waiting for you in the mountains. He will not lose you. Rest assured. You will not be able to take a step and it will kill you all. Glenn is right. I will stay. It does not make sense for me to leave. Okay. There is work to be done. Look in the mountains. Go. But why is he not here? He is a dirty model. On the other hand, Stan may not come for her. We have to show him that we are not joking. I guess your boyfriend is not interested in you. He would find another girl, Sevi. Do not worry, it's playing on your nerves. You're just scared. What are you doing; Let's kill her, Jefferson. Send her her body. Maybe then he has the "nuts" to appear. Listen, Sevi, I will make you a suggestion. I will set you free, but you will promise me that he will not understand. Only under this condition will you leave. And promise that you will never come back. Why should I accept your views, Jefferson? Respect ... ... I try to be compassionate. I will make her work together. Leave me with her for a while, Jefferson. I will take her out crying. This is how we will get the coward out of his hiding place. I know very well that you are pretending. Because right now you two are scared, not me. Glenn! Jefferson! Come out fast! No! Burn them! Take it and burn it all! Didn't you hear, idiots? Go burn them. He sent six empty coffins! You understand what that means, don't you? It means that there is no hope! For both of us we may be given a chance. What are you waiting for? Do it quickly. Keep going! Put on the fire. Get them here! It makes no sense to stay here. We have to leave soon. - What do you think; - I do not know, Frank. Are you scared? So we do nothing. Let's go get the gold. We know where he is hidden. OK let's go. Go saddle the horses. Here it is hidden. At dawn we will cross the border. Come on, all we have to do is clear the entrance. Gold is waiting for us. Let's go, boy, let's go. - Jefferson deceived us! - You're right, let's go back. Have a nice trip, gentlemen! Hey, Louis! I need sleep. I am forcibly held by the barrel of the gun. I understand you. Jeff and Frank seemed smarter. They beat her. We had to go with them. I'm sorry. Not that I understood them when they left, I was sleeping. I go to wash, go in and undress. Hey, Pete, come here. - What's up; - Look in the trough. Frank and Jeff are dead. We are only four, Jefferson. I know. Better to leave, it makes no sense to stay here anymore. Where to go? When we leave he will be waiting for us. Get up. - Get up. - Leave Jefferson alone. You heard me. I said get up. Do not be stupid. Leave her. Lady is the reason she will keep us alive now. I do not agree with you. Your plan was stupid. I do not pay a penny for what you want. I will not wait here anymore. Did I get it? I will not wait here anymore. I'm with Jefferson. Let the girl go. If we do, maybe he will let us leave here. Do you think so? Forget it. It will kill you in pi and fi. I will not give up so easily. It does not matter what you want, Glenn. Sevi leaves, finally. Shake, Sevi. Get lost. Just a minute. We will make an agreement first. Tell him he will get whatever percentage he wants. There is a lot of gold that has not been distributed. You've got it; You tried to convince him with that. What are you talking about, Sevi? What is it? Give it to me. All the time I thought it was for gold. It's something more. You may be right, Jefferson. If he is Bill Ross's brother ... ... we must get out of here as soon as possible. Refill it. It 's cold. We have to make a plan. I think we's better to break up, so Stan will lose track of us. We will meet again after a few days in the cave to get the gold. - No, let's go get the gold right away. - Keep going, Jefferson. For now let's leave it hidden. As soon as it dawns we will go with the boys and hide in my house. For half a minute. The people in the city ... ... maybe he knows something now. Possible. Stopping there is stupid. Can anyone see us. You may be right. Go with him and come back. You know where the cave is, eh? When will the coffee come? Stupid cut! Hey, Pete? Come outside. What the hell is he doing? Stan did it! Must be here! It's here! - I do not want to die. - Louis, come here! Louis! Louis, do not pop it! It will catch you too! Are you going somewhere, Louis? It is not here. He must have left. I did the whole house up and down. - And where is it? - I do not know, maybe he followed Louis. At least we do not have his breath behind our necks. We must take advantage of it. There is something we need to do. Let's go get the gold. Louis! Quickly. Aid! Aid! Aid! Do not stand like that! Hurry up! Solve me! Go look and see what is going on. Is here. It will blow me up. Somebody help me! Please! Do not leave, help me! - What happened? - Glenn! Glenn! Help me, fast. Stan said he was going to kill me! - He will shoot me! - Stan is here! - Yes, he is here! What to say! This man keeps his word ! He told me: "I will find these men ... ... or I'll blow up the whole city. " Hey, wait. For half a minute! Go back! What a cowardly people living in the city! Let's get back to work. What is this; The price for another coffin. I hope he does not blow up the next one. It will take me a month to find his pieces. That's it. What 's going on here? Where did everyone go? - It is empty ... empty! - Calm down. Something must be happening here. Why is there such silence? I have a bad feeling. Be ready to shoot, Glenn. - Nobody is here. - You're wrong. I know he's here. From the other side. Come. - Hurry up! - This is also empty. We were trapped. Come out, Stan. Come out, if you have the "nuts". Δειλέ! He's playing with us, Glenn. Until he kills us. Jefferson, keep your eyes open. I'm going to find him. Stan! Stan! Where are you; I know you're here. Coward! Show yourself. Get out. Do you want to shoot us in the back, coward? Glenn, what are you doing? Are you out of your mind; Stan ... here it is. I keep it for you. I will leave you alone with Jefferson. He killed your brother. I have nothing to do. He did it. Aid! Stan, did you hear? Stan, you can also keep the gold. And to have your brother's killer. All you have to do is let me go. - You can not do this to me! - What I said is true, Stan. Let me! Stan, do you agree? - Answer! - Please! Hello. Motionless. I want to know what you said about Ross. It's all true. This is your brother's killer. She shot him in the back like a dog. What do you think; It's yours. - I will leave him now. - Then leave in front of me. Stay where you are. Do not shoot. I killed Bill because he had to. The bank robbers threatened me. Either his life, or mine. I will give you what you want. All the money I have. Everything. What are you doing; There is only one sphere in the chamber, Jefferson. And you can do nothing. I will take revenge on Bill Ross. Too bad ... it was not in the first. Maybe it's in the second. Come on, kill me, Stan! Do not keep me in suspense. If it's to be done, do it now . Calm down, it is not good for your health. How much do you bet the third will be the pharmacist, Jefferson? What do you say? Are you betting? Thanks for the help, Glenn. Now it's my turn. To see how you will enjoy the game. I would enjoy it ... ... but I'm in a hurry right now. I will find the sphere. It's all over. Come out everyone. Stan brought all the gold. Thank God you are alive. My love! It's all over now, Stan! Everything is over! You will be fine. Just let me hug you. From now on we will be together forever. You are wasting your time. The bastard is dead for good. A lot of money. The coffin is ready. I'm done for today. Everyone raises their hands. Thanks for everything. Thanks to you I found the gold. Goodbye. - Ate, do not let him take it. - Do you want us to shoot you? Miguel, hurry up. Let's go. Fast. Remember; You thought it was me who stole your gold. I know you got the money from insurance. Remember that. Goodbye, gunman. Many thanks. Goodbye, Amigos! Oh, Stan, when you get well, we will start a new life together. Are you sleeping; Stan ... my love! Hands up, gunman. - Surprise! - What's up; Why are you angry? You wanted to pop it and I caught you. - Get down. - Oh, my love! - Shut up. Throw your gun. Okay, Sevi. I never quarrel with a lady holding a carbine. What do you have there? Gold from robbery! But I thought ... Espartero ... Espartero took a sack full of stones. It belongs to me now. I do not believe your word. You have made many poppies. You came to take revenge on your brother. Brother? - Which brother? - Bill Ross. Wasn't he ... your brother? Professional partner, that was it. And friend. Wasn't he a friend? Dosilogos. Bill and I were planning to rob the bank. But Jefferson overtook us. - So that was it! - Respect ... - ... drop the gun. - Back off. Come on boy, you are more honest than him. Respect, did you go crazy? Go back. Think for a second. Gold is a fortune. What a shame! What a pity to give him back. You think I'm really stupid, aren't you? - Goodbye, gunman. - Goodbye, my love. What a pity! Do you really want gold? E, gunman? We will make an agreement and you will have it all. Gold ... and of course me. Do you think that with blackmail we will be together again? AMATEUR SUBTITLES * pistolero * end
