The Big O Dearest, we're back to review today's press. And we see some hot photos: it's a naked, gay, Romas Zabarauskas! It's written that on Friday, the filmmaker successfully funded his new film. He promised to send his naked pic to those who donated. Many wanted to see it and he collected $20,000! Though Romas's films aren't commercially successful, as DELFLIt reports. He could now easily change his line of work.... Bitch. Indré! Romas! Oh my God. Sorry, I'm coming here so unexpectedly. I'm sorry. No problem. I didn't give any notice. No, no. I just can't believe it. Well, come in. My goodness, I have so many questions for you. Do you want tea? Yes, please. Thank you. The red one is really good. I bought it in London. Try it out. I want chamomile. Chamomile is good too. Can you buy it in Moscow? It's very Lithuanian. I don't know. I don't drink it there. It is somewhat Lithuanian, isn't it? It isn't really Lithuanian. So how are you? Good. Very well. How was your premiere? Russian Pudding? Good. It went really well. He's a good director. Awesome. Mhm. How are you doing? Good, everything is really well. We showed We Will Riot here and there. But we didn't make a profit. I know I still owe you. Oh, you think that's why I came? I don't know. C'mon, I understand. How is your love life? Very good. I showed the film in Mexico and found a boyfriend. Really? Yes. Mexico, but it's so far away? Yeah, but he's here. Where? Here. You want me to call him? He's sleeping. Oh, here? No, don't call him now. What is it? What happened, Indré? I went.... I went.... No. No. I was noticed by the famous acting coach. Gina Caplan. She works with a lot of stars in Hollywood. She had a master class in Moscow a month ago. She noticed me from a thousand participants. I volunteered for an improvisation and she noticed me. Afterwards she proposed I take her courses. And I agreed. I decided to quit everything and go. But I need money. The courses cost $20,000, let alone living costs. I came to Lithuania to get my money. She owes me. When my parents divorced... ...my father left me half of the House she's living in now. It's clear. But my mom... She never gave me anything. She said, "If you want, come and live here." But mom... I don't even live in Lithuania. But maybe she doesn't have any money? She does. She married a successful businessman. She's just using me to get revenge on my father. She wants his attention. It's unfair! So, she promised me money. She promised to cover my LA expenses. We made a deal. She said, "Come. We'll go to the bank and fix everything." I came from Moscow. And it's same bullshit again. She will only give me half and I'm supposed to ask my father for the rest. It's unfair. She has to give me my share. My father dealt with her a long time ago. He even told me to take her to court. But how did you? I took the keys from the safe. The safe is under this ugly Sarfinas Sauka painting. I took it down. I opened the safe. And then she got in my way. I pushed her to the side of the safe. It was an accident. I really, really didn't intend to. Then she started screaming. And I hate her yelling. And I pushed her again. I pushed her two, three times total. Romas, I think I did something wrong. Nijolé Grubiené, the mother of the famous actress Indré Latinyté…, …was found dead in her home. The police suspect homicide. The police have not named suspects. The body of Nijolé Grubiené was found in her home. Police officers are at the scene. Anyone with relevant information should contact us as soon as possible. Who? Police officer Nerijus Dambrauskas briefed us at the scene. I don't know. Nijolé Grubiené was married to a… Give me the phone. …businessman, Audrius Grubys. Her daughter, Indré Latinyté works and Rives in Moscow. And what if? It will be fine. But if they? Really. Answer it. Who? Hello? Hey Romas, it's Diana, sorry to disturb. Did you hear the news? What news? The mother of your actress friend was found dead. Of who? Indré Latinyté. Did you know her mother? No, I didn't. Really? I'm at the scene now. Her stepfather and the police are here. It's a terrible event. I'm just thinking of who might know something. I don't know what to say. But maybe you know someone who might have some information? No, I don't. Well then. You can write that I think she has nothing to do with it. That's what I think. Thanks. Who was it? A DELFI journalist. I'm screwed. You can't go to the airport. Did you steal it? I didn't steal it. I took it. YOU CAN'T ESCAPE LITHUANIA Subtitle by Misterhutch We'll take a small road and cross the border to Poland. Or no, there aren't borders Now we're one European Union. Then Germany. We'll pass France, Spain, And finally get to Portugal. In Portugal, we'll rent you a place somewhere in the mountains. No questions asked. When things calm down, we'll come visit you. Stay here. Do you want anything? Give me the tablet. Here. Did you get any water? Get down. You had to tell me, but yes, I did. Where is Carlos? He went to smoke. We don't smoke. - Don't be stupid. - No stupid. - Come with me! - No. What the fuck? I don't understand nothing! What? You don't translate me nothing. Baby, I'm sorry. Look, your friend kill mother. No need help. Well, it's not that simple. My friend mother no good. They fight, mother dies. But she's my friend and I have to help her. Can we go now? If you go with me, you can fuck me tonight. They suspect me. The police named me as a suspect. What? Eight years to life. This punishment would await actress Indré Latinyté if convicted. Wait a sec. A life sentence? Why? Because she's your mother. What's the difference? There is a difference. But why? Why? Indré Latinyté is the main suspect in her mother's murder. Police are asking anyone who has seen the actress..., ...or who has related information to contact them without delay. Gay filmmaker, Romas Zabarauskas's exclusive interview on DELFI. "I don't think she could have done this." Look, maybe we can stop. I'm sick. Subtitle by Misterhutch Carlos! Carlos! Carlos, help Indré. - No. - Give me. No, no. I don't want to. Give me. No. What are you doing? Stop! Stop it! Damn it. Why? Mhm? I'm filming our last film. Every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Every story is a metaphor of life. We tell stories all the time. This is how we, people, communicate and relate to each other. Throughout history, people have told stories. In fact, history itself is a collection of stories. There are many theories on why people like stories so much. Psychoanalytical theory, based on Sigmund Freud, states... …that our narrative desire is motivated by both our sex and death drives. Our sex drive, Eras…, …makes us create…, t…o have sex, to have children…, …to have an impact on our society or humanity…, …to leave stories behind, to produce meaning. Our death drive, Thanatos..., ...is our secret wish to dissolve into nothingness that we once were. This drive makes us want to experience the end of the story. But the story has to have enough shifts and repetitions so we could believe that end. To conclude, we want same sexual texture..., ...and then death..., dissolution into nothingness. This is what we want from our lives..., ...and this is what we want from our stories as well. Mom. Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good. Are you driving? I can call you later. No, no need. Are you going somewhere? I'm.... We're going to the seaside with Carlos. Oh, really? You didn't say anything. We only thought of it this morning. Oh, OK. I read about Indré. Yes. You know about it? Yes. It's horrible. Horrible. And you are OK? Yes. Romas, are you really OK? I'm just very shocked. It's very strange and sad. I understand. Okay, Mom. We'll talk later, okay? Okay, okay. I have to go, bye. Bye-bye. What did she say? Nothing. Was she suspicious? No, don't worry. And she knows about Carlos and all? What do you mean? Well that you're together? Yes, my mom is very progressive. And your dad? My dad is very religious, they divorced and I'm not in touch with him. Sorry to keep asking. No, it's OK. My mom and her parents support me a lot. I just think sometimes that I don't feel enough. I don't feel enough for myself, my family, friends, Carlos. Should we speak in English? No need. It's not nice, no? I said, no need. Well but you're working with films, working with feelings. But you don't like my films! I don't like how I act in them. Well here, I'll tell you a story. A few months ago, I was at our class reunion. Everyone was talking about their news jobs, being married, not married, etc. Our teacher, who organized everything, showed us our theater plays from different years. She had recorded everything with a cheap camera. And I had a main role in all of them. Watching it, I realized I'm not a good actor. I was even a really bad actor. You were a child. No, wait a sec. I was thinking, again and again, and decided to invite her to dinner. We went to a restaurant. And I asked her why she let me act and why she gave me the main roles. At first she just laughed. But at the end she admitted that it was her way of thanking my parents... ...for supporting the theater financially. You're exaggerating. I'm not. My parents were always defending me..., ...and I felt like I never achieved anything on my own. But you achieved a lot. Yes, but only with the help of my parents. What are you doing? Romas! Wait! Wait! It's beautiful here. Another theory claims... ...that we wan': one thing from our heroes because of our common sense..., ...and another thing out of our narrative desire. For example, in a film, Titanic..., ...our common sense tells us... ...the best ending would be everyone staying alive and in love forever. But at the same time, we also want something tragic to happen to our heroes..., ...because we know it would make a better story. It is precisely this clash of conflicting desires that entertains us. Put the phone away. I'm making a film. Your film is boring. Give it to me! Give it! Carlos, come here. Question for you. Are you legal here? Here, in Lithuania, understand? What are you doing? It's interesting! No it's not. Visa till July. What, what? Say me again? Visa till July. Oh, I see. And then what? Everything is over? Why are you filming? I'm doing the film. Let's do it! So.... Your love story will end? Then I will go to Mexico. Wow! And then that's it, bye-bye Carlos? Well I'll go to Mexico. Or I'll get Carlos an artist's visa. Or, he'll stay here illegally. Give it back. A film needs some drama! Drama! We're making the film, aren't we? Yeah? Then tell me why you killed your mother. Stupid. You think it was for money? No, not for money. You don't have any tact. You killed her for something else. Wanna know why? Well, tell me. Tell me why, you piece of shit. Your grandpa is a famous writer, a well-known genius. He wrote a few bestsellers. Won awards, met our President. Your dad is also a genius writer..., ...a journalist. So what? They are the best of us. They are the voices of their generations and you always wanted to be like them. And what, is that bad? Well, no. But see, they are men and you are a woman. And you hate this. And you're a queer. In Lithuanian society, only men are considered geniuses. Men create. Women procreate. You hated all this. That's why you hated your mother. Your mother was avery simple woman. She didn't know anything about art. She only cared about you, loved you and irritated you. And you were afraid to become like her--a stereotypical woman. Shut up. You were convinced that the femininity you had from her prevented you... ...from reaching fame. Look, now really, shut it. You want to kill your femininity. You want to be a man. Shut up! It will hurt now. Aaa! Ouch! Take this. But you really are crazy. I am really very, very sorry. (ranting in foreign language) While discussing narrative from a psychoanalytical perspective..., it might be interesting to observe... ...that psychoanalysis is itself an exercise in narrative building. The psychoanalyst hears the stories, dreams, associations of his or her analysand... ...and then tries to incorporate them into a single, coherent narrative. It is this narrative, and the revealed repetitions in ones behavior..., ...that help a patient to better understand his or her life. I like the old tunes that no one listens to.... C'mon! At night I listen to metal. Guys! When all the neighbors sleep.... I like to live this way. Well, snob? And to be independent. To be my own boss. And to love the way I want! I like to live this way. And to be independent. To be my own boss. And to love the way I want! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Damn it. Where are you going? Toilet. We have a spare tire, but it won't get us to Portugal. Indré, run. What? I said, run! Hello. Hello. It's me. It's you. Carlos, I need to run, police is here. I go with you. Thank you so much officer. I couldn't have done it alone No problem, really. I was checking for speeders nearby..., ...saw that you're in trouble and thought I might be able to help. Not much to do around here. But you weren't alone? Not alone? I saw two people running to woods. Yes, it's true. They were hitchhikers. And they left you alone like this? They-- They'll cut through the woods. People these days. Let's stop. I can't anymore. Do you hate me? I hate. Look, I'm sorry. It's OK. How did you meet Romas? Mexico. Yes, but how? He show film. Did you like my acting? Yes. Thank you. Can I ask you, Why are you with Romas? I don't understand. OK, forget it. So, what do you do in life? Guess! I don't know, really. Guess! Well... Maybe you are a war veteran? You wok so tough. No, no war. Peace. Something with tourism? No. Well, I really don't know. I'm very bad at guessing. I'm an escort. Escort? What do you mean by that? Gay for pay. Oh really? Oh, I'm sorry. I guess it's none of my business. It's OK. Do you mean that Romas is paying you? Yes. How much? Four thousand euros per month. And how long have you been together? Four months. That's a big amount of money. I know! You are this gay filmmaker, Romas Zabarauskas! Yes. Oh man, awesome! What? Our boss, she's also, you know, the same. So she's always praising what you're doing. Unbelievable. Well, then... ...I'll go back to my speed checks. Thank you so much, officer. No problem, Romas. Good luck. Officer! Your jacket. Thank you, Romas. No problem. What is? Nothing, just... ...money. It's all about money. You know I play in those TV series and commercials in Russia. And I get paid. Get paid very well. But I don't like what I do. I'm selling out. I'm acting in all kinds of bullshit. And when I participate in interesting projects, something I believe in, I get never paid. Romas, for example, never paid me anything. Shhh, all is OK. I just think..., ...why am I doing this? For fame? For art? I just feel that I'm an escort myself, Carlos. Your heart is right. We got lost. Really? Yeah, can you imagine? We were running, and then we stopped..., ...looked around, and realized we don't know where we are. Did you look for us? No, I was afraid I'd get lost. And how did everything go? He was looking for speeders. He helped change the tire. What are you doing? We're going to my grandparents' summerhouse for the night. Subtitle by Misterhutch It's beautiful. But why is it so dusty? No one has been here in the last ten years. Why not? We stopped going here after my parents divorced. I told my mom that I was gay. She understood, but my dad didn't. He threw me out of the house. My mom saved me. She and my grandparents brought me here. They were bringing me food and taking me to school every day. Yes. Thrown out of my home. He gave me a thousand euros. One thousand litas. And told me to live on my own and then see who I think I am. My mom couldn't kick me out. When my dad discovered everything she'd done to help me, he was furious. They divorced and we've never seen him since. That's horrible. Yet, I keep thinking. What if I had taken that thousand and tried to live on my own? Maybe I wouldn't be so spoiled now? But then there wouldn't be those silly films. There wouldn't be Carlos. There wouldn't be Indré. Bedrooms are upstairs. Wait. I want to tell you something. I decided... Decided to go home. What? I want to go to the police and confess. Why? You were right. All my life I wanted to be like my dad or my grandpa. I wanted to be a genius and fought for it for a long time. But you can't fight for it. You either have it or you don't. And I don't. I think you do. Let's say I do. You really do. Let's say so. Let's say I do. But then I made a mistake. I was wrong, Romas. Why? Because I did something immoral. You did what you did. But do you want to spend your last days in prison? Don't you understand... ...that it's worse to live all my life knowing I killed my mother? It would be awful. Even my own freedom isn't worth it. I couldn't. I decided. I want to go to the police and tell them everything. My conscience will be cleared. It doesn't fit the plot. What plot? The film that we're doing. What film are you talking about? We'll talk tomorrow. Wait a sec. To hell with your film. What film are you talking about? That bullshit we shot with your phone? That "bullshit" has a really good plot and classical characters. What characters? We'll talk tomorrow morning. No, Romas, we'll delete everything. Carlos told me that you're paying him! What? Maybe you should pay me first before filming your bullshit, OK? I am a renowned filmmaker. And you're too incompetent to share your opinion at all! Romas, you have no talent. Wait. Stop! No, stop! [Emergency number] I'm sorry. For what? It's only acting. I know you're tired. But maybe let's film that final killing scene? Which scene? The final one. You're going to the police after all. So we need to film, to finish the film. OK. So give me the knife. Give me the phone. ONE YEAR LATER Hello! I'm sorry. Good evening, everyone. I'm happy that our gallery is presenting a new Lithuanian film today. This premiere is part of the Vilnius Film Forum and is expanding to new spaces. I don't think I need to introduce Romas Zabarauskas. But I'm happy to present his work in the contemporary art scene. Let's just welcome Romas Zabarauskas. Romas, I haven't seen the film yet, but I wanted to ask what inspired you? What inspired. I prepared a few things but wasn't ready for questions. Please, the stage is yours. Thank you. I'm very happy you came here. We can be sure that in this hall we are the new Lithuania. A Lithuania without racism, sexism, or homophobia! Please applaud! Thank you. When I write my scripts, I dance. I just dance. I put on some music and dance in my room with all my energy. I dance until I forget my body and stay with my thoughts, alone. But this time I didn't write a script. I turned the camera on myself and filmed myself dancing. I'm not a professional dancer. Is watching me dance interesting enough? You decide. But at least one day I can say that I danced. I danced. To dad Some theories say that the traditional film narrative, as we know it..., is in fact a historical practice..., ...feminists accuse this narrative of reinforcing patriarchal norms. Indeed, a story structure is often compared to an act of male orgasm. The climax of the story being an ejaculation. So these theorists claim... ...we should rather attempt to escape the patriarchal form of narratives... ...and do something more avant-garde and experimental instead. Three act structure, the climax and its' entertainment value... ...all of it can be seen as neoliberal form of art... ...made to create emotions and manipulate the viewer... ...in order to retain the existing social boundaries. Let's say for a moment that the story is a metaphor of life. Then, lets also say that the story I am telling has no meaning. Does that mean that life has no meaning? What if life doesn't have any meaning? Romas! Should we then cease telling stories altogether? Or maybe, in fact, we tell stories in order to pretend... - Should I turn it off? - No - ...that fife does have meaning. Maybe we are telling all these stories... ...neoliberal and avant-garde historical and psychoanalytical... only because.... Subtitle by Misterhutch Follow me on Wattpad: misterhutch
