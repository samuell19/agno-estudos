First and 10, Saints, on their own 45 yard line. Six. Two. Seventeen. Hut! Headline and a keeper, tackled by Walter Johnson and Jack Gregory. Two yard loss. Second down, 12 on the 43. Hey, hey, hey, all the way! One, 17, hut! What kind of football was that? What the hell's wrong with him? Catlan's pass intended for Abramowicz incomplete. Abramowicz was wide open. ...now on the 43... Schmidt, Brown left, 31, delay trap. Now! All right, Cat. Brown left, 31, delay trap. Motion green left, 71, on two! Ready? Break! Here we come, Daddy Cat. We're gonna kiss you good! - Set one, two, hut, hut! - Zebra, zebra, red, red. Catlan's pass intended for... Way to go, Daddy Cat. There goes your ball game! Screw off! ...tackled by Elijah Nevin. Looks like Catlan was hurt on the play. Looks like his leg again. Leroy Callahan, picked up five. Brought down by... How bad, Doc? I'll have to shoot it for sure. Go inside and get some ice on it. Two, 64, five... I'll get it. Charley Caraway carries... Kelly, get ready! Gain of two, third and three on the Cleveland's forty-five. Tackled by Mike Tillman. Get the play I sent in? I got it. You didn't call it. You got any idea how bad you look? When you think you're too good to do what I say you're gone! ...at this final pre-season game. Bill Hill's in trouble. Recovered by Fred Whittingham. Saints' ball on... Hey, Catlan! You're through! File for Medicare! A change in the Saints' line up. In at quarterback, number 19, Kelly Williams. Remember, next Sunday your New Orleans Saints open their regular season against the Dallas Cowboys here in the Sugar Bowl. Come out and cheer the Saints on to a championship! Seven, 3, 25! Hut! Hut! Pass to Abramowicz, covering 34 yards. Kid, get me a Coke. Saint's ball, first and 10 on the Browns 19, tackled by Kellerman. Set! Three, 15, hut! Hut! Pass, pass. First down safe. You're through! ...tackled by Barnes and Kellerman. Three, 35, hut! Hut! Ernie Wheelwright stopped by Frank Parker on the one foot line as the game ends. Once again the Saints' management thanks you. Drive carefully. Give me a hand. Forget it, we'll get them later. Keep ice on it, come in tomorrow and we'll take some x-rays. How's the knee? Dandy! It's gonna be a long season. This looked like one of the real rough ones, Jimmy? Yeah. Who do you think played well, Coach? Want to single anyone out? You saw the same game I did. Do you? On which team? Don't try to get any laughs around here, Woodward. The winners are across the way. You were on the one when the game ended. Would you say you were beaten by the clock? Another quarter, they might've beaten us a hundred points, the way we were going. Even with Kelly Williams playing the whole game? You gotta admit it, Jimmy, he moved the club. Kelly's a fine boy. We got another fine boy, name of Polanski. Someday one of them is gonna be our quarterback. Why not now? You guys kill me. Two free beers in the press box and you're bucking for coach of the year. Well, why not now, the way Catlan's been playing? Look, Cat's playing may not be as great as it used to be, but that was the best, maybe the best quarterback ever been played. His bad is still better than anyone else's great! Go on. I don't need this crap. What do you need, Coach? Sympathy? Yeah. And my wife's got it all poured and iced up at home. Give me a break, will you? See me tomorrow morning. Give me a ring. All right. All right, good night then. Good night. Hi honey, how are you doing? Hey, Kelly. Hi, Kelly. How's it going, Cal? Congratulations. Yeah, the 22nd wonder. You showed me more in 20 seconds than Catlan did all night. Please, Mr. Catlan. You got it, let's go. Hey, you Big Cat, come here. Come on, would you sign this for us right? No autographs. Oh, be a good sport. I don't sign autographs. Who do you think you are? You're not even worth the price of a ticket anymore, anyway! Look, get lost. Big shot. Too big to sign an autograph? Who do you think you are? Just who in the hell do you think you are? Go. Hello. Where in hell were you? The Look magazine people came in, remember? You left me hanging there with those two harpies. The plane was late. Don't Look magazine people ride in cabs? Ron, I couldn't ask them to do that. They flew all the way from New York. I don't give a damn if they flew all the way without an airplane! When I ask you to pick me up, I expect to be picked up on time. I don't want to stand around in parking lots being insulted by lunatics! I'm sorry, Ron, I really am. Drop me off at the restaurant. Ron, please, we've got the party. I'm not going to the party. Did you get hurt? I just don't feel like going to a party. Well, I can't blame you. A bunch of old hens cackling about fashion. Poor Felicia. She'll be crushed. Felicia who? Felicia Crane, the international editor. Big fan of yours. It's nice to know I've still got one. I'm sorry, Ron. Did you lose again? I'll see you later. Waitress. Would you please give this to Mr. Catlan? Thanks. That lady over there, she asked me to have you sign this. She looks like a real swinger. Did she tell you to say that, too? I tossed that in for free. Give it to one of the boys in the kitchen. Phone call for you, Mr. Catlan. - Yeah. - Dad. Hey, Richie, how's the boy? Pretty good. What happened to you guys out there? You should've won that game by a couple of touchdowns. Somebody forgot to tell the Browns. - Did you go? - I saw it. We're here now, having the wake. Why don't you come on over and join the mourners? I'm not in the mood. You and Julie haven't even seen my pad yet. Julie's not with me. I'm stuck here without a car. That's very beautiful. You wait exactly where you are for 20 minutes, man, and I will be over there to pick you up. Wait right outside. Mr. Catlan. I'm your chauffeur. Richie sent me. I'm Ann Marley. What happened to Richie? I volunteered. Why? Well, I thought it would be a good way for us to get acquainted. Are you shocked? Not really. Well, my intentions are strictly honorable. You see, I'm a sports enthusiast, and I think that you do what you do better than anyone else in the world. When's the last time you saw me play? Tonight. Richie's been holding out on me. He usually tells me when he's got a new girl. Richie's new girl is the last thing I'd care to be, Mr. Catlan. No, we're just friends. Tennis chums. I own a tennis shop. Here in town? 1126 St. Charles. Baseline. Come in and see me sometime, I'll give you a discount. Do you like it? It's hard to believe. Three years ago, when Richie quit catching my passes, he still thought the Cajun Motor Courts were about as classy as you could get. Aren't you going to say hello to Richie? He looks pretty busy. I'll catch him later. Hey, Cat, say hello to my mommy. Hello, Mother. No guts? I guess that must be it. Suppose this is Daddy? No, that's my date. Now, Richie's got a compulsive stripper, and I've got a lush. Would you like the grand tour? This is Richie's playground. Hell, maybe I should get into the car leasing business, at that. Everything works electrically. Contact. You are now witnessing the most revolutionary discovery in the long and glorious history of bed making. How do you come to know so much about the way this house works? I'm a friend of the owner. A tennis friend. Better? Fantastic. You know, you've got great legs. Did you ever think about having an affair with a quarterback? I told you my intentions were strictly honorable, Mr. Catlan. They seem to be having a ball out there. That's funny. I could've sworn I heard loneliness. Well, sure, everybody's lonely. Don't pay any attention to me. I'm a drag at freaky parties. You know, I'll never be able to understand what makes a girl do something like that. Off the cuff, I'd say that she's as inhibited as hell, and damned frigid. And if she didn't strip at parties, she'd probably end up throwing herself under a truck. Tell me, do you think you could slip out there and get us a drink? I'd get caught for sure. That'd ruin everything, wouldn't it? Yes, it would. Tell me about this tennis shop. You getting rich? Nothing sensational. It pays the rent. Pays for this. Gives me lots of free time to play tennis. How long have you had it? About a year. What did you do before that? Modeled. I hate models! Why? Well, they're skinny and they never smile. I was plump, and I smiled incessantly. Did you ever work for my wife? Once. I did a bathing suit show. Had to wear a bikini. God, was I embarrassed! Why didn't you tell her to go to hell? When you're young and eager, you don't tell Julie Millard to go to hell! Ditch the beer. Could I see your license? You look like a guy that might like football. I thought that was you. How'd you like two tickets to the Dallas game on the 50? Sure, but who can get 'em? You could. Just write down your name and address. Would you hold this for me? You'll have 'em in the mail by Wednesday. Like to see you guys win for a change. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? Try to keep it under 90, would you, honey? I'll do my best. So long, you crud. How do you like that guy? He never even said thank you. Where do we go from here? You go back to Julie and I go back to the party. What time is it? 2:30. Where were you? Richie's. He had a house-warming. Is it nice? It's a bloody mansion. That's Richie! Who was there? The football crowd. Anyone else? Some girl. She climbed up on the bar and took off all her clothes. Really? It's a wonder you came home. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. I know what a tough day you've had. Good night. You're through! That'd ruin everything, wouldn't it? I think that you do what you do better than anyone else in the world. Hello. Cat? Penny Farber. Well, what is it, Penny? I've been sitting on a hot rumor. I didn't want to ask you about it, but it blew up on me. Well, go on! Cat, I'm really sorry to hear the game's losing you. What the hell are you talking about? Cal Woodward's column in this morning's Times. You wanna hear it? "Talking with a Saint player after last night's sputtering farce, "this reporter learned that Ron Catlan is giving serious thought to retirement. "In this reporter's opinion, such a move would benefit not only the Saints, "but Catlan himself. "His performance during the exhibition season "has been nothing short of embarrassing. "Admittedly, the downfall of a champion is a tragic event. "But if the Big Cat is contemplating retirement, the time is now." Cat? Yeah? What's the story? Is it true? Why don't you ask the son-of-a-bitch who wrote it? Come on, Cat, a story can be written a lot of ways, you know that. Give it to me and I'll write it your way. If you want a press release, go to the club. God knows, they own you guys for a beer and a sandwich every Sunday. Oh, no! Dropped by Tony Warrick... ...by Chuck Walker and Bobby Williams. Fourth down. Tom McNeill to kick from his own 15. Johnny Rawlins returns to the Cardinals 25. Elijah Nevin and Les Kelly made the tackle. Catlan! Fumble recovered by Tom Barrington, tackled by Dave Baldwin. It's yours now. You're the man. Good luck! In his first National Football League appearance, Ron Catlan, sensational rookie from Notre Dame, now quarterback for the New Orleans Saints. Pass. Red, right. You were told to stay on the ground! The next mother opens his mouth in this huddle, I'll stick his helmet in it. Pass. Red, right, double flank, X, Y, Z, coordinate. On two. Ready? Let's play! Richard Crowley, 42 yards and Saints touchdown. And away, Catlan away! I know what it says. Cat, don't you think you should've come to me first? When I'm ready to retire, you won't have to read about it in the newspapers. He got it somewhere! Not from me. Well, I wonder which one of our boys he talked to? - Ask him. - I did. He's a smart-ass. Aren't they all? Cat, level with me. Do you really want to quit? If I did, I guess I would. What about Williams? Mr. Williams is a different story. I don't know, Coach. He's a very complex young man. IQ's okay. He won't learn as fast as Stevens, but he's bright enough to pick up your program. He wants to lead. Rate him high on leadership. Rate him extremely high. But here's the complexity again. He's suspicious, extremely suspicious. He'll need a lot of encouragement. If you keep him, you'll have to handle him with kid gloves. He's a puzzler, Coach. But I'll tell you one thing, he'll never be mediocre. With him, he'll either go straight to the top or right down to the bottom. Sorry, I didn't know you were busy. Hold it a minute, be right with you. Doc, you said this kid could stand up under pressure when the going really gets tough. I don't see why not. Cat! Making your cuts? - On the defense. - How many? Seventeen. Any veterans? Scooter Vear. Well, he's expecting his first kid next week. Can't you put him on a taxi squad or something? That's the game. Now listen, Cat, on the offense, Davis wants Williams, and I want Stevens. What do you think? Don't look at me. Ask that headshrinker you've got in there. I'm not gonna stick a knife in anyone's back! We'll do the knife-sticking. Just give us your opinion. You're asking about a couple of kids who are after my job. Williams thinks he can get it. The other one, Stevens, he doesn't. He's willing to wait till I quit. I think Williams wants to push me out right now. I guess maybe he scares me a little bit. The other boy doesn't worry me. Okay, Cat. Is this you? The Cal Woodward thing? The Cal Woodward thing. You know me better than that. I don't know anyone better than that. Time we got acquainted. Cat, this is just for the record, I talked to Cal Woodward last night, but I didn't even mention your name. Now, if you don't wanna believe me... I don't. Okay. You know, Kelly, you're really something. One forty-yard pass and you've arrived. No, you've departed. Cat, Graham couldn't beat the clock. Tittle couldn't beat the clock. Connely couldn't beat the clock, and, Daddy Cat, you can't beat the clock either. You're 40 years old, man. The party's over. The king is dead. I've seen better blocking in girls field hockey. You had five seconds. The player of the game, and the man who has just made the New Orleans Saints champions of the world, Ron, the "Big Cat" himself. Catlan. Okay, John. That's all for today, fellas. That was a real fine pass, Kelly, you did a good job for us. Coach. You keep telling me that. How come I don't play? You've been in. Five times, 10 downs, an average of 20 seconds a game! What're you bitching about? I haven't played that much in five years! I'm good enough now like he was good enough 10 years ago. Oh, come off of it, rookie! No, sweetheart. I think... More like this. Uh-uh, I want a cover-up. What's there to cover up? Well, look. The young look, see? Simple and shy. Sweetheart, they're featuring skin this year! They're featuring youth! Wilma, what do you think? Looks good to me. Bitch! Ron! Hi. What a wonderful surprise! Hi, hot lips. I thought they only let you out of your cage on Sunday afternoon. I chewed through the bars. - Hello, Wilma. - Hello, Mr. Catlan. How goes life among the wild animals? I thought we might have lunch. I'd like to, but I've got so much work to do on the show. Felt like talking. I can't, Ron. I'm free. How about me? Yeah, that'd be swell. Well, see you later. This is where it all starts. Right here, at the reader. These punch cards contain basic facts, numbers, letters, coded words. The specific information we've programmed for a particular job. This is the biggest reader we can make. It processes 1,200 cards per minute. We consider that slow. At that rate, we'd be wasting the computer's time. So instead of going directly from reader to computer, we take an intermediate step. We call these the storage drums. There's a huge revolving magnetic disc in there. It can absorb 256 million digits from the reader. I've always told you there was a job for you here. And it wasn't just party conversation. I meant every word I said. To tell you the truth, I don't see where I fit in. Management. I want you in the management of this corporation. Why? Well, number one, you have a math background. Fifteen years ago. Number two, you're accustomed to functioning under extreme pressure. Number three, you're a driving perfectionist. And, number four, you're probably the most dynamic leader of men I've ever met in my life. Set two, 17, 48, hut! What's your problem, man? See him, rookie? He's number one around here. You don't even breathe on him. You'll spend the next few years of your life with these machines. You'll get to know them probably better than the members of your own family. You'll learn the language of computers. Fortran, PL 1, Cobalt. You'll be on intimate terms with each and every one of our customers. If that means an occasional trip to the golf course that's so much the better. It isn't easy for you, is it? No. Nobody said it was supposed to be. Nothing is. Nothing worthwhile. What I'm offering is worthwhile, Ron, for both of us. I've been playing football for 25 years, ever since I was a kid in school. I understand. No, you don't. It's not just a game. It's not even the money. Hell, for the loot the league makes, they pay us like peons. It's pride. It's a lot of things. How old are you? Forty-three. Ron... Let me give you the facts of life. More than half the population of this country is under 25. And those kids are smart. So smart, it's frightening. And the corporations are buying it. They're buying youth. A lot of places won't even give a man of 40 the courtesy of an interview. I believe in you. I want you here. There's a future, but it's now. Right now! In six months, I might find some young genius with a long string of degrees. A year from now, I might not even be able to offer you a job driving the company truck! Hiya, Cat. How you doing, buddy? Who's your date? Oh, now, be nice to me, my friend, because I've got a wonderful idea for you and your boys next Sunday at the half-time show. Yeah, I know we all go out on the field in your cars. Oh, not only my cars, but my convertible cars. And the gimmick is that you and your boys will be topless! It'll never work, baby. With my build, I'm sure to get arrested. Hey, doll, will you bring the guys a drink? Will it be the same thing, fellas? How old are you, honey? Why? You're keeping me out of a job. What job is she keeping you out of? Any job at all. You name it. I'm offerin' you a job. Selling cars. Leasing cars! You know that! I lease them! I lease more cars than anybody else in this whole bloody state and you know that! You cold fish bastard! Now what's that supposed to mean? The year you make All-Pro End, you quit. You cut it cold, just like that. Well, that's the way it is, Dad. When you're ready, you're ready. It's just like smoking. You know something? I was 21 years old when I broke into that league. I'd play games on Sunday, and I'd hurt just until Tuesday. But when I retired at 34 years old, I would play on Sunday and then I would hurt all the way until Friday! With me, it's an even week. Well, that's 'cause you dig pain! I can live with it. Well, how about booing, babe, can you live with that? You asked for it, man. You asked for an opinion, so I gave it to you, that's all. Cold fish bastard! Hey. Hallelujah. He finally caught us after all these years of sin. I've been trying to call you for two hours. Don't look so dyspeptic. The husband always finds out last. The show was a smash, hon. A total, unmitigated smash. Look magazine flipped. They're gonna do a feature on me, little ol' Miss Julie of New Orleans. If you play your cards right, hot lips, I'll see you get honorable mention. Out! Ron, please. What's the matter with you? Did you lose a punt or something? Out! I see. When we've had a little too much to drink, we get nasty! We huff and puff and show everybody we're a big, mean, football player. Ron... My gosh. I hope that thrills you! Now that was hideous! He makes me puke! Everything's spoiled. Beautiful day. Perfect. Now it's all spoiled. How come you're never home? Huh? How come you're never home? Why should I be? 'Cause that's where it is! I'm not a maid! You don't seem to need much of anything else. What would you know about what I need? I tried. Bully for you! God knows I tried! What do you want, a gold star? Just a life, Ron! This? Yes, this! When's the last time you saw me play? When is the last time you asked me? You've got a lifetime ticket, baby! I'll bet there isn't a woman in America who knew more football, saw more games, read more books than I did! You're my wife! That's another thing. I even tried to get along with the wives, with their little card parties and tight, suburban, little minds! You never had it so good! I never had you! That's what I never had. The small world of Ron Catlan. Knock 'em down. Trample 'em under! Grind 'em to a pulp! Just like tonight! Poor hot lips. He's a very special human being. You can say that again! Most creative man you'll ever meet! The creative world of Julie Millard! You're so creative this mess is worthless! If you're so creative, why don't you try something basic for a change? Why not try creating a baby? You bastard! It's a laugh, isn't it, honey? Bastard! You're so damned creative you can't even create a damned baby! Get out. Get out! All right, you're hard to handle, huh? Six. Two. Thirteen. Hut! Two, 35, hut! Better! Much better! Good work, Kelly! Good! The first time's always the hardest. I guess that's because there's no guarantee of a second. Hey, I've seen you work on film. I think you can make it. Do you have any idea what my life will be like if I don't? Then don't blow it. You work till your ass drags. Take every hard shot they can give you. Pain is the name of the game in the pros. Use your brains. Idiots don't make it up here. Study. Take your play book to the can with you. Ask questions, here. Once you're in the game, it's too late. Wake up, Daddy Cat. It's a bright new day. Six, three, 21. Hut. How'd you like that one, baby? How'd you like that one, baby? Daddy Cat, you just blew your cool. You proud of yourself, Cat? You been behaving like you've been playing, like a damned fool! I'm gonna take $1,000 from you. You heard me! That was a dumb bush act out there today! And to go along with it, you've been very public about your drinking. Who says so? Friend of the owners. Saw you reeling around town with Richie Fowler. From a rookie I could understand it. Might cost a rookie 100 bucks. But you been with me 11 years. You're supposed to be the team leader. Set the example. I can't have that. I won't. Not from anyone. Especially not from you! I think I'm gonna quit, Jimmy. Are you that scared? Okay. I can understand that. It's happened before. What's happened before? Fear. Fear of being hurt. Fear of failure. It doesn't really have to be anything. Just fear. Knock it off, Jimmy. I've seen you play a rookie like a violin. Don't try it on me. I'm not playing any violins for you, Cat. If you're so uptight you wanna quit, then I don't want you quarterbacking my ball club. Okay. What's next? For me? I go with Polanski or I trade for an experienced quarterback. Kelly's not ready yet. For you, make your peace with the general manager. I think you owe him that. I don't owe him a damned thing. Not him, or you, or the club, or anybody. Don't work on me, Jimmy! This is the pros, remember? The pros, Coach! Where contract time's a regular love-in, and you sweet-talk the price down 'cause you know we've gotta play. We only have so many years. Then you've got us and out comes the bullwhip. Pretty soon a hot, young kid comes along and we're out on the street again. No tears, no loss, and nobody owes nobody nothing! I think you've got three solid years, Cat. Three good seasons. They're yours if you want 'em. Cat! Nelson! Roy Nelson! How are you? The body's all right. I can't complain. Glad to hear it. Come over to watch the action? Yeah. I'm gonna cut up a few touches with the old-timers. Not too many around anymore. That's right. Cat, can you lend me some money? Sure, how much do you need? I need a couple hundred. Things must really be bad. Couple hundred, is that a lot? Hell, no, 200. That's eating money. You must really be hurting. Yeah, it's been rough on me. It's been rough. What happened? Nothing, I just waited too long. Seven, eight seasons, not quite eight. You played more than that. No, taxi squad, semi-pros. What, are you interested in statistics? Here. That's all I've got with me. Thanks. Hey, Nelson. Yeah? How come you didn't quit? I mean, it wasn't like you had anything great going. You know how it is with the jockstrap. I mean, I been a jockstrap all my life. When I was a kid in school, I mean, I was the great man. I was it. And when I came up to pros, I held on pretty good. I mean, I pulled my own weight, didn't I? Sure. Well, you know, it's different being a lineman. There were five square yards on that field that belonged to me, on every play, and it's something you couldn't give up. When you're playing, you're too proud not to and too dumb to fight about the money. Why, they got us by the shorthair anyway. We only got so many years, and they know that, so we gotta play. That's why nobody holds out because that's a year gone. Oh, hell, when I look at it now, I wasn't good enough to make it big and I wasn't smart enough to quit. But you know something, Cat? I miss it. Surer than hell, well, I miss it. - Hi. - Hi. How was practice? Oh, same as ever. How come you never read your mail? I guess it must be one of my syndromes. Wanna buy a tennis racket? Any calls? Your mother. Darn, I was supposed to call her this afternoon. Maybe we can run over there after dinner? What are you doing? The plans for the cabin. What are you doing with them? I'd like to start building. I thought we were gonna wait until you retired. I think maybe it's about that time. My God, do you know what our phone bill is? $113.50. You're not interested in a damned thing I do! This is ridiculous. What's that for? Did you hurt your knee again? Honey, Ron, please. Listen to me. Honey, believe me, I do care. But the cabin's a dream we had when we were kids. Neither of us has time anymore. Life changes. Don't you hear one word I say to you? You're thinking about retiring. I've heard you say that for the last five years. You're supposed to be relaxing. That's the whole idea. I am. I may never get up again. Just as I thought, tight as a drum. If you stop I'll kill you. I love this music. A lot of people say it's a little too sentimental. What's wrong with the world? Sentiment's become a dirty word. Hey, I told you not to quit. It's really sad. If you try to show a little honest emotion, everybody thinks you're square. Tell me... How come you're not married? That's another thing. If you're over 25 and not married, everybody thinks you're queer. Come on down here. Brandy makes me talk. Some nut, huh? Yeah, some nut. Some special nut. I never thought you'd call. I never expected to see you again. Is that why you sent me that little fan letter? That was tricky of me, wasn't it? Nice to know I'm a preferred customer. Very preferred. You better get out of here. Why? You know why. I think it's too late. We'll both be sorry. I doubt it. Don't say you weren't warned. No fair going to sleep. I'm sorry. For what? Earlier. I mean it. I am, too. I slept with another woman tonight. No reaction? God, Ron. What do you want to do about it? We all know it's an occupational hazard, don't we? The surprise is I never expected to hear it from you. Do you wanna call it quits? Is that what you want? I guess it really depends on your present situation, doesn't it? Are you in love with... Whomever? No. I'm not in love with her. Just kicks? No! Just... Something. If you're saying I've let you down sexually, Ron, you can go to hell! All you ever had to do was reach across the bed! I reached! Half the time you weren't even there. I mean, let's get basic. If you moved into that damn shop of yours, I wouldn't even know you were gone. Maybe you like it that way! What's that supposed to mean? As long as I'm working, you can twist things any way you like. It's not what you did to my life, it's what I'm doing to yours. I'm the one. I built the wall! I spoiled everything! How convenient! You can even waltz your way through a little affair and come back feeling like a hero! That is crap! And you know it! Then how come you never asked me to quit? Not once did you ever ask me to quit. Figure it out, Ron. There must be a reason. All right. I'm asking you now. All right. I will if you will. God, you are a marvel of subtlety. I wasted half our marriage being subtle! What a pretty picture! I can see it, the two of us hand-in-hand in the unemployment line! But don't use money as an excuse. People have to eat! Richie Fowler's doing all right! Do you want me to sell cars? Is that what you want me to do? I didn't say that! Richie Fowler's the unhappiest son-of-a-bitch I know! That's his problem, not yours. He was always unhappy. You weren't. Ron. Sooner or later you've got to do it. Honey, you're 40. You haven't learned one damned thing about me, have you? That's me! Look! That is my life! It's all I care about! I do it better than anybody else in the world! - Do you? - Yes! Anymore? To be the best. Don't you know that? The best there is! When I'm out there and it's all working. It's something... Honey, listen to me. You've always been able to do anything you wanted. You can do this. You can! Success. What do you think of it? I'm impressed. It's about time you hauled yourself down here and took a look, you know. You really like it? Well, it's a lot of aggravation, and a lot of long hours, but I'm making a bloody fortune, babe. And I'll tell you something else. I do not miss football. What do you do exactly? Well, I smile a lot. And I travel out amongst the people, shaking hands, and then I try and convince them that they gotta be out of their minds to go out and buy a car when they can lease the car from Richie Fowler. You know something, Cat? Right now I've got over 1,000 units out on the road. You know what I'm gonna do five or six weeks from now? Open up an entire new division, and dedicate it just to trucks and tractors. And as soon as that gets really swinging, I'm going into real estate. There's a lot of money in that. Land development. Millions of dollars. Get the lead out now! Get those legs up. Get 'em up! Up! Down! Dig! Come on, get those heads up! Come on, let's go! Break it up! Everybody in. You all saw that horror movie of the Brown game. I don't have to tell you how pathetic we looked. If anybody threw a block out there, I couldn't find it. Sloppy tackling! Five fumbles! Add it all up, it's pretty disgusting! The exhibition season's over. We open up against Dallas, Sunday. That one counts! I want it bad. I want 120%. Any man who doesn't give it to me better be ready to travel! Better pack his bag! And I don't care how many press clippings you've got. If you're not ready to bleed, I don't want you! Did I make myself absolutely clear? Okay. Let's find out who wants to play football. Let's go! Man, I hope you've got something with a view. You guys are too damn much. Hey, Cat, here comes your new center. I'll see you guys later. Come hack here, man! You better don't forget this. Hey, Cat, how about some poker? What's bugging him? Same thing that was bugging him last week, and the week before that. And the week before that and the week before that. Let me have your attention. Deke, you wanna start? Outside of Cat, over here, I guess I'm about the oldest guy on the club. I've been in the league for 12 years now, and that's more than enough time to learn that my purpose in being here is to do more than just collect paychecks. We've got a good ball club. But if we expect to win any games this year, what we're gonna have to do is to dedicate ourselves. Put our hearts into it. And if some of you rookies don't learn this in a hurry, I'm gonna ship you out of here myself. I don't wanna be spilling any of this sweet red juice out there for nothing. A lot of you were here when we won the championship. Most of you were here last year when we finished second in our division. We won 10 ballgames. Beat Dallas in Dallas. Hell, fellas, they're no better than we are. It's time we started playing some football! There. There's just a couple of things I wanna say. First of all, I live in this town. I got my family here, and my kids go to school here. And I'm damned tired of them having to make excuses for me and this team. There's a lot more pride in this room than we've been showing out on that field. You know and I know the day's gonna come when we gotta quit playing this game. When we do, it's gonna be gone forever. So let's not let it down while we're here. Cat, you got anything you wanna add? No. Cat, you coming? I've had it, Deke. I think I'm gonna hang it up. But you're coming along. Even if it's just for the ride to the ball park. You gotta do that. You can do this. You can. And you'll spend the next few years of your life with these machines. You'll get to know them probably better than the members of your own family. I'm offering you a job leasing cars. Here. Take these. You quitting us? Well, whatever you wanna do, you go ahead and figure it out and do it. Don't listen to nobody but yourself. You hear what I'm saying? I mean, you don't owe the game, or us, or nobody a damn thing. What the hell, you paid your dues. I think you got three solid years, Cat. Three good seasons. Strap 'em up good, Bobby. I feel a big mean coming on! Where's the Cat? He was on the bus. Okay, men, let's have a good, quick, snappy warm-up. Let's go. Hey, let's go, Saints! Go get 'em, babe! Hello, Mr. Catlan. Down one. Hut! And go. Go. What's it gonna be, Cat? Okay. If you can't make it here, I'll fix it so you can try some place else. Don't trade me. I won't report. Then quit. You've got your release with all my blessings. You know something, Jimmy? You're a whore. Anybody ever tell you that? I produce, whores don't. I intend to produce with this team, whether you're part of it or not. Okay, men, everybody up. Okay, Tom. Our Gracious Father, we come to you as a team. Watch over us. Help us, Father. Each one of us might play a game that will never bring injury to either us or our opponents. Father, we just acknowledge you now, as a team, by repeating the prayer that you have taught us. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...
