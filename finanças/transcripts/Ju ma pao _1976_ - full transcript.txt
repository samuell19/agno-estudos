[dramatic music] [quiet dramatic music] [dramatic mystical music] [dramatic music] [waves roaring] - A very long time ago, there was an island in the South China Sea. It was known as Phoenix Island. The capital of the island was a magnificent place called Golden City. The emperor of the city was aided by his three loyal generals. They were Chao-Chien, Ma Tsen-Kung, and Pao Ta-Hsiung. They combined their talents to establish a new form of kung fu, Sung-chi. Even the most fearsome bandits were scared to cause trouble on Phoenix Island. The citizens lived their lives in peace. But one day- [dramatic music] [hooves thudding] [wind whistling] - Grand Master, now I have the dragon stick, you will soon rule Golden City. You will be the new master of Phoenix Island. [Grand Master laughing] [wind whistling] [bright music] [dramatic music] - Hyah! Hyah! [bright music] [suspenseful music] Hyah! Hyah! [horse whinnying] [dramatic suspenseful music] [wind whistling] [wind whistling] - Old man, you missed me. You're careless. [woman gasping] [blows thudding] [men grunting] [rings clinking] [wind whooshing] [man groaning] [dramatic music] - Master! [blows thudding] [men groaning] [suspenseful music] [blows thudding] [men groaning] - Master, Sung-chi is finished. We can attack the city. - Hm. Give the order. Attack the Golden City, now. [dramatic music] - Attack! [men groaning] [people shouting] [dramatic music] - We attack! [people screaming] [dramatic music] - Attack! [people shouting] [dramatic music] - The west is breached. It's falling. - Well, get reinforcements. [people groaning] [blows thudding] - We attack! [people shouting] [people screaming] - Go on! Go! Go! [people shouting] Go! [door creaking] [men groaning] [people shouting] - Ta-Hsiung. - Chien, what about the gates? - Two more have fallen. - Huh? - You go to the palace without stopping, or else we'll all be beaten. - What's that? You will stay? - Forget me. You go quickly. - Uh, yes. [people shouting] [swords clanging] - Go quickly, quickly. - My daughter! My daughter! [man screaming] [woman screaming] [blows thudding] [men groaning] [dramatic music] - Just go! [blows thudding] [men groaning] - My daughter! I left her inside! - Huh? I will go rescue her. - Oh, be quick! [blows thudding] [men groaning] - Help! Help! Please help me! [blows thudding] [men grunting] - Empress, you had better leave. - No, I will not leave you! [blows thudding] [blows thudding] - Empress, may god speed. - Tsen-Kung, you are the only one who can save us. [men grunting] [blows thudding] [swords clanging] [blows thudding] [men grunting] [people shouting] [man growling] [swords clanging] [men grunting] [thunder rumbling] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [man laughing] [man shouting] [man groaning] - Daughter! [blows thudding] [men grunting] Daughter! Daughter! Princess! - Princess, do not be afraid. I'll get you out of here. - Tsen-Kung! [dramatic music] - Darling! - Papa! - Dear, you must leave now. - What's that? Will you not help us both to get away? - Don't leave me. [sobbing] - But I have an important mission. - You may not really care about me, but surely, you must help your little girl. [sobs] [people shouting] [dramatic music] - But I have no choice. I can only take one person. - But she's your own daughter. - Well. - Tsen! Tsen-Kung. Tsen-Kung! [sobbing] - Daddy. - Tsen-Kung. - I am sorry. I have my duty. [woman sobbing] It's what's expected of me. [woman sobbing] - Tsen-Kung! [gentle music] [woman sobbing] - Hey, darling, [laughs] don't cry. I'm here now. - What are you trying to do? [man laughing] [woman sobbing] - Kill her. [woman screams] [blows thudding] [man yelling] [dramatic music] [bright music] - Father. [suspenseful music] - Where is she? - Search! - Sure! [suspenseful music] - Father, father, it is, it's terrible. The poor child. - I hurt her. - Why not save her? [woman whimpering] - Uncle. - Princess, don't be afraid. You're safe. [man gasping] [dramatic music] - Where's Chi-Pan Mountain? - This is Chi-Pan Hill. - Please, do me a favor. Take the child [groans] to Chien Chao Chin. - Uncle. [whimpering] [dramatic music] - I am Chien Chao Chin. - Listen carefully, you must find that child at all costs. Get on with it. - Yes, sir. - Quickly! [suspenseful music] [man gasping] - Listen, she's a princess of the Golden City. You, you must look after her. - Uncle. [crying] Uncle. - Don't go. - Master, Master, they're chasing us. - Hm. Hm. How dare they do that? [people moaning] [wind roaring] They will not be able to get through this fog. No one will be able to enter the mountain for the next 19 years. - Master, the princess will be fully grown in 19 years. - Hm. [dramatic music] [gentle music] [man grunts] - I am certain I can beat you. [men grunting] [blows thudding] [man laughs] [blows thudding] [men grunting] - You have proved that you fight well. Now you can join us. - Thank you. [dramatic music] - Tell me something. Why do you tie these knots each year at this time for the past 19 years? Huh? - I tie them for you. Only you can untie these knots. - Oh. Good. Then I'll untie them. [laughs] - His Majesty. [bright music] - I'll hide, Mother. - Your Majesty. - [laughs] Get up, get up. Where's my daughter? - Here I am, Father. - Huh? - Come on. - Ah! [people laughing] [blows thudding] [man groaning] - Huh? [people laughing] [blow thudding] [man groaning] [man laughing] [woman giggling] [man groaning] - You first. - [laughs] Your kung fu is pretty good. Come on, sit down and have a drink with me. - Uh, Your Majesty, I don't think I'll stay for that drink. - [groans] All right, then, if you don't want to give me face- - [giggles] Hm, I think I'll go for a walk while the weather's still dry. Majesty. [bright music] - Hey, take some guards. - No need. Mother, I'm going. [squealing] [man gasping] - Steamed buns. Get your buns here. Steamed buns, finest steamed buns. Come on, then. Get your steamed buns here. Hey, what are you doing? Money. - Huh? What's that? I don't have to pay. - Hm. - Hm. - Huh? [blows thudding] [man groaning] [people laughing] [man grunting] [blows thudding] [woman giggling] Now you must buy it. [blows thudding] [people grunting] [people laughing] - Oh my god. - Huh? - Huh? My steamed buns. Oh! Oh! [woman laughing] - Sorry, I must got now. - Wait. Wait, you must pay me 100 tails. - Really? Come to my house. - Not 100 tails, but one tail. - Oh. - My friend, one tail, all right? - Yes. Thank you. Thanks. [people chattering] Thanks. [quirky music] [people chattering] - Hm. [quirky music] - Hm. - Hm. - Sorry. I came late. - Oh, it's all right. Now tell me, where should we go for a walk? Where should we go then? - I cannot go. I'm on duty. - Huh. [dramatic suspenseful music] - You bastard. You're only able to make trouble and not business. You've no regrets. I must capture and punish you. - Hm. That sounds fair to me. But then, can you catch me? - Attack! [blows thudding] [men grunting] - Sire. [blows thudding] [men grunting] - I want to talk to you. - Let's go over there. - What's wrong with here? - Hey! [blows thudding] [men grunting] - Hey, get away! - Thanks. - Princess, why do you let him off? - Hm, and when will you ever learn to forgive and forget all the past? [gentle music] - You were the princess of Golden City. General Ma brought you here 19 years ago. He was killed after you safely arrived. General Black oppresses the people. He pleasures himself all day at their expensive. He doesn't care for the people. General Black's kung fu is very good. You alone could never beat him. - Well? - Only Generals Chao, Ma, and Pao could beat him. - Where are they? - They're already dead. - They have descendants. Let's find Ma, Cha, and Chien immediately. - But master, she's the black girl. - The black girl? - So she is. Now Ping, come here. - Mm-hmm. - Master! - Enter the palace invisibly and give this to Yen Chi. - Yes. - It has been exactly 19 years since the fog sealed off the mountain. It is time it was lifted. You may leave. - Yes. [laughs] Right. [mysterious music] [wind howling] - General Tao has lifted the fog today. The time is up. - Have you seen anything suspicious? - No. - [laughing] Good. Then we're safe. [laughing] Come along. What time is it? - Noon. - Emperor, I must meditate. - Hm. All right, then I must go. [laughs] Goodbye. [bright music] Ah, my little sweethearts. [laughs] - I'll get you more, sir. - Okay. My little sweethearts. Huh? Huh? I'm dreaming. - He's baked. [quirky music] - Why not, then? [laughs] [women giggling] I am drunk. [all laughing] [quirky music] [man humming] [woman gasping] - Shh. - You. Who are you? What are you doing here? - Uh, I am Ping, from Chi-Pao Mountain. - That will be all. You may go now. - Yes. - Get up. - Empress, don't be afraid. My master is Ching Chong Chin. He asked me to deliver this letter to you. Here, it's for you. Here, here. Here. [paper ripping] [gentle music] [woman sighs] - Well, I waited for this day for 19 years. Now it's arrived. - [laughs] What did he say, Empress? - He asked me to tell black girl the truth. - Mm-hmm. - And he wants her to find both Chao and Pao's descendants. And when she's done that, she must go to Chi-Pao Mountain. - Hm, hm, hm. But where is she? - His Majesty. - [gasps] I will find her. Don't you worry. Hide yourself. - Calm down. I know how to hide myself. [laughs] [quirky music] [dramatic music] [upbeat music] - Sung-chi kung fu will again be supreme on your arrival. Go now. - Yes, Master. - Be careful. That magician will always be watching you. [hooves tapping] [mysterious music] - There she is, the princess. Ask the general to quickly arrest all teenage girls. Don't let one of them go. - Sir. - No fish will slip through my feet. - He is not your father. He's your enemy. [dramatic music] - No! No! I can't believe you. You're just lying to me. You're lying! - Do you remember the 19 knots that I tied for you? [pensive music] I wanted you to know the hatred of being conquered. Will you believe me? - But I- - Your own mother, she was killed by these bandits 19 years ago. I saved you in the confusion. [thunder crashing] On your body is a sky horse. It will remind you that you are a descendant of one of the three generals. [gentle music] - We all have marks like that? - Yes. When you find others with similar marks on their bodies, they are also descendants of them. - [sobs] Mother! - Check the town. Now get going. - Sire! - Come on, don't stand there gaping. Go check anyone with skirts. - Sir, yes. - General, what do you think you're dong? You're disturbing the peace. - Ah, I am responsible. You shut up. Hey, I said only teenaged girls. Go on! [women sobbing] [man grunting] [people chattering] [fist thudding] [woman screaming] [man shouting] [people chattering] [woman screaming] [blows thudding] [men grunting] - Quickly, get up. There she is. Get after the princess. - Stop there. I will get her. - Sir. [footsteps shuffling] - Captain Kwan Shan Yu? - Who are you? - I'm Shao Yu. [dramatic music] - The day is here already. Princess. - Get down. - Princess, I'll cover you. You go. - No. You shouldn't expose yourself yet. - Get her! [suspenseful music] [blows thudding] [men grunting] - After her, quickly. - Sorry, I- [man yells] [drums thudding] [women screaming] - Where the hell are you taking him? It's obvious he's a man. - Princess, I'm terribly confused. I can't tell whether it's a man or a woman. [blows thudding] [men grunting] [wood clattering] [man groaning] [hand slapping] [man moaning] - Well? Hm. - Yes, yes. [woman laughs] [people shouting] - Hey, which way did she go? - She went that way. - Oh. [dramatic music] [woman screaming] [blow thudding] - Hey! Shao Yu! - Koa Ping! - Shoa, we better go that way. - Right. [upbeat music] - [laughs] Sorry! [dramatic music] [blows thudding] [men grunting] [man growls] [blows thudding] [men groaning] - Sire, you go. [gasping] [dramatic music] [blows thudding] [men groaning] - My god. Shao Yu must have been captured. - You, how do you know her name is Shao Yu? - Well, I know that Shao Yu is the princess. - Princess, you know no more. I'm sorry. Princess, I'm going. [woman grunting] [dramatic music] - Kwan Shan Yu, if I'm not mistaken, you're Chao-Chien's son. Am I right? - Will you kill me? - Hm. I won't. On my back, there's a mark. [triumphant music] [mysterious music] [mysterious music] [footsteps shuffling] [man sighs] [footsteps shuffling] - Dad, dinner. [Dad groans] Sorry, Father, it's not much. - Son, you're very good to care. - Anyone home? - Go and see who is that. - Right. [dramatic music] - Is your father called Pao Ta-Hsiung? - Don't bother me now. I was just eating. - Take off your clothes. I want to see your behind. - Huh? You want me to show you my backside? - I have to know whether you are one of us. [suspenseful music] [man grunts] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] Take me to Pao. - My father's ill. Why not go, before you die? [man sighs] [bright music] - Please, will you tell him we have found the princess? Tell him that Chao-Chien's only boy has been to visit him. [suspenseful music] - Chao-Chien! Come here. - Father, sit down here. - Sit down. I have something to tell you. Listen carefully. [dramatic music] - Come on. Come on. [dramatic music] - I'm sorry, Captain, but we've been ordered to kill you. - I have expected this all along. [blows thudding] [men grunting] - It's under control! [blows thudding] [men grunting] [dramatic music] [blows thudding] [men grunting] [footsteps shuffling] - Hm. [dramatic music] Watch the little bastard closely. You, make sure his feet don't touch the ground. - Sir. - Yeah. [man gasping] - Huh. I'll ask His Majesty when we can kill him. [suspenseful music] - Let him go. [blows thudding] [men grunting] [man screaming] [blows thudding] [men grunting] - Princess, you can't let him go. - Hey, I don't want to let him go. I want to kill him. - You can't kill him. He hasn't been questioned. - Oh. [blows thudding] [men grunting] [upbeat music] [blows thudding] - How can I escape with this thing on me? [screaming] [men laughing] [blows thudding] [dramatic music] - Stop laughing. Catch him. - [laughs] Bye! - Huh? No. He's escaped again. [groaning] [mysterious music] - I am certain that she is the princess. - Hm. You must kill her, and then we will be protected. [people laughing] - If you kill me, then I will rest in the knowledge that you will die. - Emperor, the man we captured has escaped. - Hm? [blow thuds] [man groans] [woman laughs] - We must get rid of her. Take her out and kill her. - Stop. - Wait. Emperor, we cannot kill her yet. - And why is that? - You must have a better plan. Hm. - Emperor, we must keep her here to get the others. When they come, we will kill them all. [dramatic music] - Good. [laughs] But what happens if she escapes? Then we will gain nothing. [suspenseful music] - Emperor, there is no need to worry, for I can put her in a place where no one can escape from unless they are dead. [dramatic music] [mysterious music] [man yelps] [man groaning] - Shao Yu, wait. You could have been killed in there. - But how's that? [water bubbling] - Look. That's melted by now. I don't think that anyone's ever gotten out of here alive. - What? No one's escaped? - Never, unless they are led by the magician. But I know someone who can come and go just as they want. - Just as they want? Who is that? - Hm. Me, Ma Chao Chien, the little black girl. Listen now. - Princess, please. - We'll leave. Come. - You may leave. - Yes. [pensive music] [woman gasping] - Mother I have saved the princess. - Ah. Princess. [suspenseful music] - Please, you have suffered enough for our kingdom. - For the good of such a noble cause, I am not afraid. He will be coming soon. Go to Chi Pan Mountain. - Yes. Ma, when I have gone, he will ask some questions. What shall we do about it? [foot tapping] [suspenseful music] - Hey, I have an idea. Why don't I take your place in disguise? - Good idea. - We'll change there. - Right. [upbeat music] [dramatic music] - I don't believe that she will betray me. But no one except her can get out there alive. [dramatic music] - Miss Ma, better get going. - [sighs] And you? - You be careful. We'll be all right staying here. Miss Ma, quick. [suspenseful music] - Goodbye, Mother and Princess. - Bye. - Help! The black girl's been captured. Help! Help! The black girl's been captured. [screaming] [blows thudding] [man yelling] - Attack. [blows thudding] [men yelling] - Well? Where's the black girl? - She was captured by them. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [blows thudding] [people grunting] [dramatic music] - Here [indistinct] are flying under the sun. They perform their best only during daylight. - I will remember. - This is demon-conquering battle line. Induce your enemy into this technique when you are in danger. I am hoping that one day you'll be able to master it. But you must practice carefully every day when without failing. [bright music] [blows thudding] Four three, forward four. General five, forward one. Forward six, conquer five. General five, conquer three. [bright music] You are given to an unusual disposition and challenge for kung fu. Only you can learn the way to defeat the emperor of the Golden City. [mysterious music] - It smells good. - Hey, give it here. - Look. Now there's none for anyone. - Why didn't you give it to me? - Stop arguing. The princess is waiting for us. Let's be quick. - All right. - I am sorry. - Get them! [eerie music] - Hey, hello. [dramatic music] - Hey, hey, hey, what's going on? - It's a chess battle. - Pawn three, move forward one. - [laughs] Chess, eh? Well, all right. Checkmate, five moves. [wind howling] Grasshopper jumping. Make fish of the sea. Dragonfly over the water. Pawn five, forward one place. Go forwards! [dramatic music] [man groaning] Knight to rook. [blows thudding] [men groaning] [dramatic music] [men grunting] [blows thudding] [men grunting] [man laughing] - Hey, hit him where it hurts. [blows thudding] [man laughing] - Now for check. [blows thudding] [man grunting] Now to win. [blows thudding] [men grunting] Damn, I've lost. I've lost. [blows thudding] [men grunting] - Retreat! Retreat! - Let them get away. [men gasping] - You old fool. You wait. [grunts] [bright music] - Grandfather. - I have come to destroy the magician's mirror. - His mirror? We can steal it. [both laughing] - Right. We'll all go. - We can't. It's too heavy. We can destroy it with this. All you do is put it opposite the magician's mirror, and it will explode within one hour. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] - What? - Nothing. You said the princess had disguised herself as a black girl. But then where is she? [people gasping] [suspenseful music] - Quick. [blows thudding] [men grunting] - What's wrong? - I think there's something wrong. - Be careful. - Huh? - We must get to that mirror. Kwan Shun, please let me do it. You won't regret it. - I can do it, invisibly. - All right, you go alone. - Right. - Wait. Be careful. - All right, I will. [suspenseful music] Out of my way. Stand back! [woman screaming] Sorry. [dramatic music] [blows thudding] [men grunting] - Now you're dead. Take him to prison. - Sir. [footsteps shuffling] [dramatic music] - Come. [woman whimpering] [blows thudding] [men grunting] - Hyah! [blows thudding] [people grunting] - Princess. Princess. Princess. You and Miss Ma are very alike. - Huh? But I am Ma Chan Chen. The princess? - Oh dear, she must be in danger. - Huh? - Damn. If she's hurt, I'll- - What? - I can't find Ta-Hsiung either. - I'll return back to the palace to see if they're there. - You can't go, not alone. Let us both go together. - No. - What then? - Well, if I'm in danger, I'll break some China. - Good. I will come when I hear that. - Hm. Then it's settled. - Good. [dramatic music] - Tell me who you are. [suspenseful music] - Maybe I was wrong. [bright music] No wine. What is it? Neither a cup nor a vase. Magician, take this with you and study it very carefully. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [woman gasping] - Leave it alone. - Sir. [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] - Don't worry, my dear. Nothing could happen to her. Her kung fu is excellent. Don't cry. Come on. You're being stupid. [suspenseful music] [man laughing] You're back, daughter. [laughing] - Yes, Your Majesty. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [mysterious music] [woman screaming] [blows thudding] [men grunting] - I'll rescue the princess. She's in the chamber. - All right, don't worry. [dramatic music] [blows thudding] [men grunting] - I'll help you, Father. [blows thudding] [people grunting] Pao Ta-Hsiung, get going. Quickly, get going. [blows thudding] [people grunting] - It's you, you treacherous bastard. Get him. - Sir! [blows thudding] [people grunting] Quickly, you must stop him. - Right. Okay. [blows thudding] [people grunting] [dramatic music] - Help me. [suspenseful music] Come on. Help me. [blows thudding] [people grunting] - Help her. [man screaming] - How's the princess? - They tortured her. [suspenseful music] - I'm sorry, princess. Come quickly. [princess whimpering] [suspenseful music] - Get them. [blows thudding] [people grunting] [horse neighing] - This way. - Come on, now! [men groaning] [suspenseful music] - They got away? [blows thudding] [people groaning] They got away, but you cannot. Take them away. Kill them. - Sir. - Great. - Please, Emperor, I have a plan. - What is it? [gentle music] - [whimpering] Thank you. - No, don't thank us. We arrived late, and you were tortured. - You're far too kind. It was nothing. For Phoenix, I would die. - Princess! - Princess, get some rest. You'll feel much better once Mr. Hun returns for the herds. - Shao Yun, lie down. [gentle music] - Go. [quiet tense music] [dramatic music] - I'm worried. Mr. Hun has been too long. - I'll search. - And me. - We had better wait a while, wait until tomorrow. - Hm. - Right. [dramatic suspenseful music] Right. [people grunting] [man moaning] [suspenseful music] [bright ringing music] [blows thudding] [people grunting] [man screaming] [blows thudding] [men grunting] [bell ringing] [people yelling] [blows thudding] [people grunting] [bell tolling] [man groaning] [quirky music] [man yelping] [dramatic music] - Daughter, where are you going? - Mother, Mr. Hun is kept in jail. I will release him. - You must be very careful. I think that they suspect you. - Mom, don't worry. [suspenseful music] Mr. Hun. [Mr. Hun groaning] Mr. Hun, get up. Please try. - Oh, Miss Ma. Miss Ma. - We'd better be quick. - Princesses. - Get on my back. [man laughing] [dramatic music] - My own daughter. [mysterious music] [dramatic music] [blows thudding] [people grunting] - Quick, Miss Ma, you can get away. [groaning] - Mr. Hun! [blows thudding] [Mr. Hun groaning] [water gurgling] [mysterious music] [suspenseful music] - Mother. Come on, quickly. - What's gone wrong? - Mother, now hold on. Quick, we must take them here. - Hold it. - Let's go. [footsteps shuffling] [blows thudding] [men grunting] - Stop. [suspenseful music] - Stop that. Tell them now. - Get lost. [woman screaming] [blows thudding] [people groaning] - [groaning] You bitch. - Mother, Mother, we'd better get out of here now. come quickly. - [gasping] For my nation, it is worthy to die. - No. - Better leave here immediately. - No! - Before they get you. Go on. Move quickly. [gentle music] [woman sobbing] - No, Mother. No. - There they are. Quickly! - Go on, after them. [dramatic music] - Stop. Kill her. [blows thudding] [people grunting] [dramatic music] [blows thudding] [people grunting] - Wait. You must both be very careful. This place is a volcano. - That's good. This is the place for revenge. - We cannot. It may blow up. - If we can't fight, then we are beaten. - Maybe not. - Ma, Princess. - What's wrong? - We can't pass. - Huh? But Master told us that if we threw the old magician's stick into the fire, at about noon then it may blow up. I'm sure of it. - You're right. Let's go. - Yeah. [mystical music] - Hey, the stick is inside that room. You get it. - Oh yeah. [wind whooshing] [mysterious music] - Come on. - First me. - Hey, take that, quick. [dramatic music] - Princess, do not move. - Right. - Haven't I treated you well over the past 19 years? - I can never forget the feeling of being conquered. [blows thudding] [people grunting] [dramatic music] [man shouting] [bright music] [suspenseful music] [dramatic suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] - You bastard. Give me the stick. [man groaning] [blow thudding] [bell ringing] [people groaning] [wind whooshing] - Hey! [blows thudding] [people groaning] [dramatic music] [blows thudding] [people grunting] - The stick will extinguish the volcano only at noon. [blows thudding] [bells ringing] [people grunting] [blows thudding] You must remember that the stick works only at noon. You must remember. - You can count on me. [blows thudding] [people grunting] - Ma. - Oh, Ping. [blows thudding] [people grunting] - Give it to me. - Give it to me. - Give it to me. [dramatic music] - Come on. - Give it here. - Give it to me. - Give it to me. - Come on. - Give it to me. - Give it to me! - Oh, Ping, give it to me. - Give it to me. - Give it to me. - Give it to me. - Oh, Ping, give it to me. - Give me.

The heavenly hawk. - The golden wheel. - Thunder in the sky. [all yelling] [mysterious music] [blows thudding] [people grunting] [triumphant music] - Let go. [gentle music] - Ta-Hsiung. [man gasps] Ta-Hsiung, Ta-Hsiung. [sobbing] - How brave he was. [pensive music] [dramatic music] [people grunting] [blows thudding] - Princess, find Kwan Chan Yu. [dramatic music] [horse neighing] - [scoffs] You can't frighten me like that. [bright music] [blows thudding] [people grunting] - Come on. - You stupid girl. [groaning] [man yelping] - Leaving is impossible. You won't escape, not now. Hm.
