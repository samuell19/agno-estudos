Produced by: DEJAN PETROVIC God has granted me a long life. I have seen and experienced much, but understood very little. Well, I guess it has to be that way. I dream of Belgrade, Cubura. That's where I was born. I can't remember when and how football came into our lives. It was all unplanned. We thought it was only a game, a boyish passion which would fade away with time. But that odd game changed our lives. Trailing its magic, we wandered to the far, unfamiliar world. Leaving our former lives and loves behind us and really believing that we will return soon, all together. Everything was new, except the old friend who joined us. Finally, we were all together. Full of boundless strength and illusions. Confident that we werejust going to play soccer. We didn't even notice how everything became different in some way. By facing trouble, challenges, and fear of death, The long journey passed by in a second. And when we arrived, we didn't know if it was the end orjust the beginning.

Ok, Brazilians are Brazilians. What can we do about it now? Let's have some fun, now that we're going home in a few days. I can't sleep anyway. The people here have a great respect for the church. Ijust hope FIFA is not in cahoots with the heavens So there will be no pressure from up there on the referees Mr Andrejevic...You know that a domestic field has its advantages. But this is an international competition, and we're doing everything to keep order. God almighty, how long do we have to wait here? C'mon guys, rapido, rapido What were you doing so long? The guy's crazy! Guys...The service is alright, but the comfort is a little problematic. Gentlemen, this won't come out in the press, don't worry.

I'm not the same man any longer. I can't even run any more. Real aces don't have to run Even the ball doesn't listen to me anymore And that's the only thing that ever did. I play ball for money, but I always owe money. Occasionally, I find a woman, but I'm alone. I've decided to stay. I'm not going back. I can't go back to the ship, I barely survived it. We didn't come here to stay, did we? Who knows why we came. Let's go Poopster, areyou free? What about a motorcycle ride? - For real? -For real. All Zivkovic had to do was cross the ocean, and look what happened... What should we do aboutjerseys? We don't have any. They can play naked like the old Greeks. -You'll find somejerseys. - Me? -A set. -I will find thejerseys for you Me. Where can I find them? -I didn't even askyou.What's your name? - Stanoje. -Stanoje. A long name for a small person. It's il contrario from mine. I am Paco. A short name but a big man. -Paco, can you make beans? -You mean butter beans? When I make beans, everyone licks their fingers and toes. Can you make some for my pals, to encourage them for the match? That's a good idea Poopster. Great idea. I'll earn some money and get the wine. Stop here, stop! -You won't clean shoes here, will you? - I will, why? -It's embarrassing, someone will see us It's not embarrassing. I earn my money honestly. There's no one to make money but me. And your pals, do they have any money? Them?They're as poor as church mice. You're all like church mice. I was smart to escape. -Are you going to help me or what? Hey. How do you play on this? Don't theyfeel sorry to step on this? What areyou looking for? You see, the poles are holding it up. Well, yes. Guys! Let's go, we have a lot of work. That means we'll talk now? We're not going to talk at all We're all talked out. What would you like to talkabout? About Brazil, for example. We don't have to talk about Brazil at all! Everything is clear. Ifwe could run away, I'd be the first one to run. Here, we'll do this differently now. We'll play on one goal Everyone to the left, come on. Now let's all go to the right. Come closer. Now everyone to the left, closer. Now to the right... And to the left.. everyone left. This is like our kolo dance. That's it! Like the kolo dance. We'll match their samba with our kolo -And us?

How did your grandfather command during the war? Follow me! That's what you'll do tomorrow! And me? You what? You have to score a goal, why did we bring you here... Come onTirke! Lead the kolo dance. C'mon. Go get them! Let's dance! Closer! Get closer. Closer. Good Everyone to the right! That's it! Everyone to the left! To the left again! Here's the Serbian bread.

Give me some, please Sir, there is some grilled fish for the gentlemen! I like simple things. Serve Oh, ok. Here. Do you have wine? Do you have... wait, here's the wine. What is with the wine, woman? That's it, sir, more wine here, please Here it is, Uruguyan trout with Serbian bread. -Tell me what we oweyou so we can pay. You'll pay it off to Brazil tomorrow. In that honor, some more wine. Poopster, where areyou going? -I'm going to the hotel. I'm tired. Why now? Eat some beans, I'll takeyou there later. I can't, really.Thankyou. You're a good man, Paco. -Me, a good man? -Yes, yes. See you. Poopster! Hasta luego Hasta luego. Paco's beans. These are Serbian beans Paco used to make butter beans. His beans were hot These are soft. This meal is with ribs. Would you like to try it?

Where are you? Ok. What are we doing tomorrow, coach? We're attacking. Who? Brazil. We'll attack Brazil. 14 JULY 1930 BRAZIL-YUGOSLAVIA What is it, you bums? Get lost. Cotton sheets, absorbs sweat, right? There's none better. Maybe the Brazilians will feel sorryfor us like this... They'll beat us senseless. -Wait guys, how can we play in this? You prefer our red jerseys, right? Yes, I'd play better Areyou some big shot? -We'd at least have a coat of arms. Just run.Why care about the color of the jerseys? Gentlemen, please! What difference does the jersey color make to you? You are not playing for yourselves, but foryour country Play soccer. It's no shame to lose from a team like Brazil. Remember that. Let's go, Haji. -You're really funny, I swear. I shat my pants Just don't look at the spectators. Tell me -What are all these rags? A smuggler, huh? Take him away! What areyou doing? You're making a mistake, boys. I'm afraid we'll get slammed. C'mon, warm up. Why are thejournalists going behind our goal? So they can photograph the goals Holy smoke, what's this? Jerseys! Jerseys!

France and Rumania finished competing, and they're going home. -Is that a problem? - It shouldn't be ifYugoslavia beats Bolivia. The honor of European football is in your hands. Are you aware of that? Pass it, go on. FIFA will have huge problems ifonly the local clubs are in the semi-finals. Without Europe in the semi-finals, mon dieu, we are... Let's stop defending ourselves and pass the ball! Pass it to me. He's not playing well! Can'tyou see I'm all alone! -It's good! -What's good, are you nuts? Ballerina! I don't understand him. Tirke, pass it to me, man Ivica! Pass it! Don't worry sir. I think we will win. I hope so. When ever did you pass it to me? When? You need to pass it to me, I'm the offence. People, bravo! Bravo! Excellent first half-time! Just please don't be so selfish, guys. Pass the ball a little. -I told Ballerina. -You again Ballerina, huh? It's ok, everything's alright. Let's go now, the second half. Let's give a goal as soon as possible. And then go back, let's keep even. This guy's crazy.That means I have to give at least two goals The coach is speaking. -I am sorry. - Let's go! Be smart. -...shoot at 16, whatever. It's iiiiiin... That's it, just kick it! -Why didn't you pass it, man? - Sorry, I have to give another goal. -Give it! Give it! -To me Ballerina! I'll do it! Move, I'll do it! -Are you sure? -I'm sure, go away, Prince! Prince! We're in the semi-finals. You're the only one who wasn't worried. - Now I am worried, Andrej. Guys, we didn't play like the coach told us to. No, we played much better. TheYugoslav national team has done more than any other Imperial power. They conquered Uruguay. Our boys, as real ambassadors of sport impress with their manners in meeting with thejet set of Montevideo. -Milovan! Milovan the great! -You're overdressed. Hey Ballerina... they'll take your pants off... What is this man doing with our players... We have, as our guest, the new star of the Mundial AleksandarTirnanic. How do you feel as a star?
