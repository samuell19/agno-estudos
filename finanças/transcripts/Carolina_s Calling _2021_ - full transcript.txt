Hey, Tomcat I'm on my way okay. I think I'm ready to give it a try. Listen, Tomcat don't do anything unless I am there. Got it? I'm too excited to wait. Look we've been on this project from day one so you're not doing anything unless I am with you. Okay, where are you? I'm stuck in traffic. How long before you'll be here? I don't know, we're not even moving. Come on, hurry. Tomcat? Hello? Impatient partner man. Screw him, it's just a quick test. Morning Haaz. This is Atlantic World Air, your package from South Africa has arrived. Great news, you know what? I can be there in about, less than an hour. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Thank you. Hey you guys it's finally here. Let's go get it. What's here boss? The superconductor. Someone actually made one for us? Yeah, remember I told you about the article I read about the gold mine in South Africa? Do you remember any of that? Not really. Alright. Here it goes. A miner found a never before discovered deposit of gold impregnated titanium. So I ordered a few ounces of it. Well, that's great, but what exactly does it do? Well at the right doping levels? The goal of that pregnant titanium will be used for our superconductor and the semiconductor is for the blue cube. Fantastic. That, that could work. That is going to work. And I'm going to go pick it up. So who's coming with me? I'm busy With what? Busy. And you? I've got to call my girlfriend. - What? - You don't have a girlfriend. Yeah, I do, I just got one. All right, I'm going to go get it. And I'll be back. You guys can chill out here okay? Who is she? You want to see her? Yeah. Check her out. She's right there. That's your girlfriend? Wait, when did you guys start dating? Oh, about five seconds after Martin asked us if we wanted to go with him. Nice. Hey how are you doing? Hi, how you doing? Hi there, I'm here to pick up a package. Yeah, no problem, can I see your ID please? There you go. Thank you very much. Do you have a routing number or a sender's name? Got it right here. It's claim number 7-4-3-2-9-7-8 and S as in Sam please. All right, got it right here. Give me a minute and I'll get your package for you. Thank you. All right, here's your package. Here you go sir. Thank you very much. Take Care. You have a nice day. Honey. Come on down for dinner. It's ready. What are we eating? Well, I got your corn, mashed potatoes and chicken, your favorite. I was craving some mac and cheese. That stuff is bad for you. So? Diabetes, high cholesterol, you ever heard of that? Yeah, I've heard it all before, the food you like will kill you. It will. Now look, I have some great news to tell you. What? You know, my blue cube Radiatron? Yeah. It's finally ready, and the final piece of the puzzle I already got it and we're gonna do great things for the planet and we're gonna be rich. That's what you always say. No, no, no, this time it's for real. I hope something finally works out cause you spent a lot of time and money on that special Blue Light Project. Now look honey, I know that things have been hard, especially since mom passed away but things are going to be different from this point on. I promise. And I'm going to make sure that you get everything you always wanted, okay? I know. I love you baby. I love you too. Okay, come on enjoy your dinner. Let me know what you think. Corn's good. See I told you. Not as good as the Mac and cheese but- - You could always have that, but home cooking like this, forget it. There you have it, gold impregnated titanium, and it's bendable, try it out. Sheer genius. See I'm planning on using this for the passage way of electrons and speeds will reach wavelength of about blue light. Once we do that we'll be able to power up any type of devices infinitely. Can you believe it? Sir, I've said this one is, and I'll say it again. This, this is going to change everything. Fossil fuels, climate change. We're going to end all of it. That's what I'm aiming for. Look, you guys are part of this. You've been with me from day one. You're very much part of this as I am. Right, you understand that? Do I have to be in the room when we test it? Freddie, really? This is safe, we've talked about this before. Yeah. Just trust him it's fine. Come on. Tomcat trusted you. Tomcat. Tomcat was impatient. He should've never tested it. It wasn't ready. We're not approaching it that way. We're doing it differently. We're not going to be in any danger. Tell him, please. Listen Freddie, Tomcat's cube had a lot of mistakes, but we fixed every single one. It's safe, it's going to work. Besides think of it this way. If it does we'll all be rich. Yeah rich or dead. Think about it this way, for the first time in the history of our planet we will be a clean planet. No more fossil fuel ever again, none of that. Endless energy, forever, because of us. I mean, it's just blowing my mind. Just thinking about all right? All right, it's blowing my mind a little bit too. I'm getting a little excited about it. Good, there you go. Let's get back to work, we got a big day tomorrow okay? Let's make this happen. Okay. Okay. Surf, sun, ocean breezes. Hundreds of golf courses. Come to South Carolina. While vacationing in South Carolina there are so many things to do. See all the attractions at Myrtle beach with over 60 miles of sandy beach off the sparkling Atlantic Ocean. Remember you need to come to South Carolina. Experience all the Southern hospitality. There's nothing like a relaxing day, basking in South Carolina's beauty. South Carolina again? That's crazy. Freddie you broke this again. You know what, real estate in South Carolina is pretty cheap. Who's cheap? Real estate homes are cheap and South Carolina. Somebody's moving to South Carolina? No, I'm just, I just put my coffee down, There's an article about homes is South Carolina and that happened to be cheap- Go back to work please. Tomorrow we will test the blue cube Radiatron, full capacity, okay? Is it- - It's safe Freddie. It's safe Freddie. Now, the superconductor and the semiconductor in place we'll be able to power up a 10,000 square foot home, with endless energy, you get that? Yeah. You boys ready? I'm ready boss. We're going to have to jump start, go for it. I'm going to hit it with about 777 microwatts of energy. Okay? Hopefully we won't take out the entire town. Okay. - Wait. It's working? - We're alive! It works? It works! Freddie come in here! - It works! - It works! I can't believe it, it freaking works! Bye bye global warming! Can't wait to tell Daisy! Who's Daisy? It works! It works! Well Ladies and gentlemen I would love to toast, because we've been through hell and back for 15 years. Cheers! Cheers! So, now what are you going to do with your magical blue light? That's a good question, honey. Well, next month we have the convention. We're going to be there with the cube and we're going to meet the big boys. Big energy companies and we're going to try to raise as much money as we can and we have one shot to do it and we're going to do it next month, right? Don't sell the farm okay? I don't really have much of a choice. I need to raise money, I need to keep my business going, you know we got to end this fossil fuel. The global warming has got to end and it's going to end because of us. That's what I like to hear, now you can make a difference. That'd be great, I'd love to see that Mr. Haaz. Thank you Michelle. Hey, to Mr. Haaz. Creator of the Blue Cube Radiatron. You're as much of a creator as much as I am about pal. Cheers! Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for coming out with us here tonight. We really appreciate it. We're about to show you something spectacular. Imagine providing and producing enough energy and power for your entire house. Yeah, that's right, you heard me right, your entire house. How building my cube, the size of a small microwave, you'll be able to produce enough energy for a small neighborhood. But why stop there? How about building it the size of a small car? And with that, you'll be able to produce enough energy to sustain a small city. Our lab, my lab, SPT labs, are the only one in the world to be able to build this new technology. And we have it here for you. Please turn down the lights and let's check it out, thank you. Dare to dream of a world transformed by sustainable, clean blue energy. Energy that will eliminate our reliance on costly archaic fossil fuels like gas, oil, and coal. The Blue Cube Radiatron produces an endless supply of continuous blue energy. Blue energy as expansive as the universe, vast as the sky and powerful as the ocean. Join SPT Labs on our journey to change the world. The future is blue. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming out and I hope you enjoyed our presentation. My team is here to give you all the information you need. Please take advantage of that and we do need your help. Thank you again. Thanks for the job Mr. Haaz, it's been great. Are we finished or is there anything else on the agenda? No. I think we're done. Thank you again and thank you all for coming. There's one thing left on my agenda though ladies. What is that? Your digits? Not today Freddie, you're a nice guy, just, just not my type. Or yours maybe? Sorry, I'm not interested. It's all right Freddie, Look at it this way, you still have Daisy and she can never say no to you. Very funny Benjamin, they weren't even my type anyway. Hey, what'd you guys think of that. I'm not sure about this. This could potentially put us all out of business. We're a small energy company. I can't compete against this. I'm not about to let this ruin everything I've worked for. I represent the natural gas industry. We've been around over a century. How do I tell 1.4 million employees that some little blue cube just took their job. We cannot allow this product to come to market, ever. We have 500 people and no check and no money at all. I don't understand, you were great up there boss. We have the greatest thing ever invented since fire. No one wants to give us a chance. You got that right. Maybe they think they'll explode or something or get blown up, you know? What is it with you and blowing things up huh? He's always afraid. That's it. They're afraid of us. They didn't believe in us. They don't believe in our product because they're scared. The cube is a threat to them. You know this oil and energy companies, they're always smothering the little guys, like us. Don't give up Mr. Haaz, we'll, we'll the funding somehow. Maybe so, but right now I got to go see my daughter and I gotta tell her that her father is a failure, again. Take it easy. Sorry boss. Honey, I got some bad news. How bad? Well, my blue cube works, but nobody wants to invest. I'm so sorry dad. You know how hard it is to ask these oil companies to invest. I'm just so mad that I let you down, again. I know I come down hard on you sometimes about the cube. Sometimes? How about all the time. I'll work on it. And as for the cube, you'll figure something out. You always do. How am I supposed to raise money for my company, without money? I mean, you can't do anything without money at all, period. I'm going to have to figure something out, you're right about that. Hey, sorry to change the subject. But have you been to South Carolina, Myrtle beach? You know, I saw a commercial earlier today and the beaches look sweet. It's funny you asked that because I never been there but I feel like the Carolina is calling me. What do you mean? How is it calling you? Well, I've been seeing this advertisement as well and I feel like we need to go there. South Carolina is like halfway around the world. No, it's on the east coast is about 3000 miles away. - Yeah. 3000 miles away. - Yeah. Well, I have no desire to go, so count me out. I'll stay here in sunny, Southern California. You know, both places have something in common. Like what? They both have beautiful beaches, and they both have the same initials, S-C. Very funny. Listen my technology is going to revolutionize the way we produce energy, you get that? Sorry, I can't help you. Come on, do you mean you can't help me, or you won't help me, which one is it? Martin, I can't sorry. Sorry I haven't called you back, it's my caller, my caller ID, forgive me. Martin, I know where you're going, it's not going to happen. Why not? I mean, just come to the office, come to my lab, see it for yourself. See, see what I'm trying to do here, give me a chance. I'd like to, but I got a large contract with another energy company, I can't jeopardize my relationship with them. I got to pass on this one buddy. Ah figures, thanks anyways. Good luck Mr. Haaz. Thanks pal. Same goes for me boss. Absolutely Freddie, thank you. This is a pretty nice guitar, I think you've got yourself a pretty good deal. I just bought a guitar. Hope to see you again. Don't play it in one shot. Hey Chango. What's up brother, how you doing? I'm good man, I got some stuff I want you to take a look, and just give me as much as you can. Okay, cool. Oh, this is beautiful stuff man, Thanks. You looking to pawn or looking to sell? No, I want to sell everything. Yeah? Whatever you can give me, I'll take it. To be honest brother, I think the most I could give you is probably 20 grand for all this. Okay, all right, I'll take it. You good with that? Yeah I'm good with that. Okay. Give me just a minute. You got it man. Here you go. Thank you my man. Hey, you're very welcome. Nice to see you man. You too, talk to you soon. Yep. Hey honey, come on downstairs, I got something to tell you. What's up? Come here. We are going on a trip. Oh where? The Mall? No, we're going to South Carolina. I was just kidding about that Myrtle Beach thing. It's not that. It's just that I've been having this feeling and it's calling me to go to South Carolina. You said that before, now it's getting weird dad. No, I've been seeing these advertisements everywhere and we have to go to South Carolina, that's it. Have a nice trip. It's only for a month or two okay? Do I have to go? I'm not leaving you here. But dad! But dad nothing, let's go. Come on dad, my friends are here, Michelle's here. Honey, you're 15 years old, I'm not leaving you here, you're coming and that's final. It's my life too. Look I have this feeling that we both have to go to South Carolina, okay? Well we can't go, you don't have money remember? Don't worry about that I'll make it work. Who wants to go to the Carolina's anyway, not me. Just start getting packed all right? Can I help you? Hi there, I'd like to know about your rates please. Look at this, we got our cactus, we're in Arizona. What is that called again? Sonora. Sonora, okay that's it, awesome. You know we're gonna need some gas soon and the next gas station is about 80 miles honey. Yeah we need some. It's so freaking hot. Who the hell would want to live here? You think, yeah feels like someone turned on the oven. What is it, like 110 degrees? Just about, you know it's a dry land. Right, dry or not, it's hot. I'm going to get something cold to drink. That'd be good, get me something too okay? Okay. Thanks. How long does this take? It's about 900 miles from east to west. El Paso to Louisiana about. Are we close to the next state? We're about 500 miles to go, something like that. Are you kidding me? I wish I was honey, I'm sorry. Hang in there okay? Look dad we're in Myrtle Beach. Three bedrooms, two full baths, a basement and large backyard. There's 2300 square foot home, must see to appreciate, favorable price, it says Sunnyside beach, so, just south of here, what do you think? Yeah, it sounds good to me. All right, I'll give him a call then, see what we got. Oh, hi there, my name is Martin, I'm calling regarding the house for rent. Yeah, we would love to come today, I'm with my daughter. Yeah, we, we can be on our way shortly. Okay, I appreciate it, thank you very much. Let's go see this house and then we'll have lunch afterwards. What do you think? Yeah, sounds good. Let's go. Glad we found something. This place looks nice, can we afford it? For awhile, let's check it out. Hi there, I'm Marty. How y'all doing, you're here for the rental? Yeah. We're here for the rental. Well come on in, follow me. And here we have the dining area and the living room with all this beautiful furniture. Would y'all like to see the kitchen? Sure. My dad loves to cook. Pearl does all the fixing and cooking around here. Best grits I've ever eaten. Look dad, you can slice, dice and chop your fingers off here. She's right about that. You're gonna chop your fingers off? No it's just a joke. I don't know nothing about no cutting board. Only know about eating. Follow me to the master bedroom and don't forget to see the master bath. Oh, I like this room. Yeah. Every room is very nice. Now do you have any questions? Well, you like it? Yeah. When can we move in? Did you bring your checkbook? I sure did. Here you go baby. Thanks. Do you see that hot blonde over there with that old man? Damn. Watch this. Good luck bud. Excuse me, hi there, my name's Zach, nice to meet you all, hi. I do not believe I've seen you around here before. We actually just arrived from Cali. Oh Cali, you're on vacay? Sort of. We're actually on a family trip. This is my daughter and there's nothing to see here, really. Come on dad, he's my age. He is, okay how old are you, what's your name? He ain't got a chance. I'm 17, my name is Zach sir. Zach, Zach nice to meet you. See, told you we're close in age. He's a little bit older than you though. Come on dad, mind if I talk to him and make a new friend.

Martin. What did I miss? Well I was just about to ask y'all to alien put put golf, y'all got that back in Cali? Alien put put golf? Yeah. Well me and my friends love put put golf, but alien put put golf would be a first for me. Cool. Cool. Me and my friends are going to be heading out. I was wondering if you'd be down. Dad can I go? You said alien put put golf? Yes, I actually have the address right here sir. Well honey, we have to go home and drop off our stuff, and I guess afterwards, sure why not. Sweet! All right, excellent. I will see you in an hour. Can't wait. Good to meet you kid. All right Zach, see you in an hour. That was quick. Yeah I see you smiling again. Wow this place is so cool! Yeah I mean the crew likes to hang out here once in a while. Let's play. All right, ladies first. Hey, that's what I'm talking about! Now that's what I call a hole in one. Pretty good, pretty good. Oh, looks tough. All right let's see what you've got. - Whoa! - Whoa! I wonder what those alien symbols really mean you know? It means, don't ever golf here again. Yeah, don't you forget that. Kids these days am I right, their strange. Isn't there like a height requirement to get in here? I'm on it. Ready? Hey thanks for letting me go today dad, I had a blast. I'm glad you had a good time. I think I'm starting to like it here in Carolina. I can see it growing on me, maybe. It had nothing to do with that boy you met? Who Zach? Mhm. Yeah I'm not gonna lie he's pretty cool. The place we went was super fun and I got to meet some of his friends too. I'm glad you had a good time right here in South Carolina. Not so bad coming out of here after all huh? Yeah, it's not bad. What the hell was that. Why am I here? May I help you find something sir? Oh I'm just, I'm just looking around, thank you. If you find anything, just give me a holler. Thank you miss. Are you following, following me? No sir, I'm just making myself available to my customers. What's up with the sir? Just being a respectful southerner, sir. Oh, well my name is Marty. Well had I known that from the beginning, I would have called you that from the start. Well, that's much better. Hm, you ain't one of those wise guys from New York are you? Me, no I'm, I'm an engineer from California. What brings you to the Carolina's? Well, that's a good question, cause I don't know, I have no idea. You don't know or you don't want to tell me? No, I, I would actually tell you if I knew, but I don't. Oh, okay. Well maybe it's the Southern hospitality? I can't explain why I'm here, it's just, I can't. Well, okay Marty, just feel free to look around and let me know if you need anything. All right. Hey Miss, I didn't quite get your name. That's cause I didn't give it. All right. Uh Marty, it's Mary Lou. Well nice to meet you, Mary Lou. You know, I have a feeling that I'm going to take this one right here. Okay. Now tell me Marty, are you on vacation? No, I'm not on vacation, I kind of feel like we were drawn out here. We? Yeah, me and my daughter, Jess, she's 15 years old. Oh, so is there a Mrs. Marty? No, she passed away 10 years ago, but, you know for somebody so standoffish you ask a lot of personal questions. I didn't mean to, it just happens, - I don't know, I'm sorry. - No, no. I'm sorry you lost your wife. No, don't mind me, I'm just kidding, I'm just, she was a wonderful person, I don't mind talking about it. Well, that's good to know. So is this for Jessie? Yeah, I wanted to do something special. Oh, that's so sweet Marty. Thank you, you know what else would be really sweet? Is if you would join me for lunch tomorrow. Talk about personal, I mean- - Hey you started it. Well as much as I appreciate the invite, I don't date my customers. Well, listen, it's not a date, okay? After all I'm just an engineer from what, California, Remember? I don't know, I- - Oh come on, I'll meet you at the diner tomorrow at noon and we'll have lunch, that's it. You know, you can be very persuasive, Marty. And since you're new in town, I'll take you up on your offer. - All right. - Sounds great. All right, how much do I leave for this? $40. - Well, there you go. - Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow then? Hi. Hi. How you doing? I'm good. Please. Just thought I'd get this table. This is amazing. What? You picked my favorite seat, how'd you do that? I did? Yes. Well you see, we have something in common already. Look at that. - Ms. Lee, good afternoon. - Hi. The usual? Yes, please and I'd like a sweet tea. Okay, perfect. And for you sir? Oh, don't call him sir. This is Mr. Marty. Yeah, yeah, I'll have a Club Med Sandwich, and a lemonade please. Okay, would that be all? Yeah, that'd be all thank you. No sweet tea? No, I'm a, I'm a lemonade type of guy. It's the best in town. It is? Yeah. I'm a little nervous you know. I haven't been in a date in along time. Okay so why don't you tell me what brought you 3000 miles to South Carolina. Well, where do I start? I've been building a machine, pretty cool one actually, it doesn't need any type of recharging. And I've been having visions and signs, everywhere I look it says, South Carolina, you got to go there. I even had like, you might call me crazy, but I've had like voices in my head, telling me to come here voice. Voices? Yeah. Wow. I know it sounded crazy, but yes, it's true. And, and what I did was, I packed up everything, I took my daughter with me, we traveled out here and she even met a kid by the name of Zach, and I call him, I call him the Carolina kid. Zach? Zach has been mowing my lawn since he was seven. You're kidding? He's a great kid, wow. Of course he has, that's right. Well tell me about you, what's going on in your life? Me? Yeah. All right. Well, I've been a Carolina girl my whole life. And I was married 10 years, divorced. Married a redneck, with a bad temper, I can't believe I did that. Started my own business 15 years ago in my late twenties. The rest is normal. That's nice, I mean, it looks like you've been doing pretty good for yourself, right? Thank you. You're welcome. I was thinking maybe, if it's all right with you, we could all hang out and you can meet my daughter Jessie and you can help me keep an eye on this Zach character. You know Marty, we just met. And I haven't dated in a long time, and I have this ex who literally just lurks around me all the time and he's not a good guy. And so I'm just, I'm not comfortable, you know, right now. You know it's not like I'm asking you to marry me or anything like that I'm just, spending some time together and get to know one another, I just have, I just have this feeling that- - Oh no, you have a feeling? You and your feelings. I have a feeling. And here you go, here you go. Thank you. Will there be anything else? No, we're good. We could, you know, hang out on Saturday, have a picnic, during the day, what do you say? Okay, Mr. Engineer. Yes! There you go. You know, you should've been a salesman. Right? Hey, is that your phone? Yeah. You want to take a picture so we know it's for real? Nice. Should I put my number? Oh yeah, absolutely, 100%. Assign the picture? Please. So! Who's your new money man? It's nobody. It's nobody Billy. Don't give me that nobody bullshit. I seen you talking to him. He's just a friend. He's a friend from California. Don't lie to me, you ain't got no friends. Hey, I'm talking to you, woman. You get back here and you listen to me. He's just a friend, okay? And we ain't married anymore, you don't own me. I should have never married you in the first place. Whether you like it or not, you belong to me. Can't nobody else ever have you. You better get away from me Billy, I mean it. Or what? Now look what you made me go and do. Don't you ever forget who you belong to. Oh, who's this? Oh , it's a friend. She's pretty. You think so? Yeah. Mary Lou, huh? Yup, that's her name. Very Southern. You should hear her accent. For your information dad, we're the ones with the accent here in South Carolina. Are you going to see her again? Yeah, I would love to, but you know, I haven't dated in such a long time and I don't even know how. It's like riding a bike, so they say. Who's they? All the cool magazines. Oh, the magazines. Well, I would love for you to meet her, maybe this Saturday and you know what she knows your friend Zach. Really? Cool. I though you said you forgot how to date? Well, it's not really a date, we're just going to get to know one another, okay? Okay pops, whatever you say. On a real note though, dad, you haven't dated since mom. It's okay for you to date again and be happy. I think you're ready. I know honey, it's been, it's been a long time. You know, mom would want you to be happy too you know. You know what honey I really appreciate your support. You wanna, you wanna head out and get a bite to eat? I actually have plans for dinner tonight already. Oh, with the Carolina kid. Who's the Carolina kid? Your boy Zach. Nice nickname. Yes, dinner with the Carolina kid. Sorry, I got to go. Have a good time baby. I love you dad. I love you too baby. Have a good time. So what do you think? You're gonna move in here? Yeah, we'll be here for awhile. Maybe a bit longer if my dad finds what he's looking for. Well, I sure hope he finds what he's looking for so you can stay. I hate to meet someone like you and then you just up and leave. You know plus I, I think you kind of like me. Oh, you think I kind of like you huh? what gives you that idea? A certain vibe, I guess. Hm, oh my dad met somebody named Mary Lou, says she knows you. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think he likes her. From the picture I saw of the two of them, I think she likes him too. Ah well Ms. Mary Lou is very nice. I've been mowing her lawn ever since I was a kid. Oh, the Carolina Kid mows lawns too. My dad calls you the Carolina kid. The Carolina kid, is that right? Yeah. It's got a nice ring to it. Wow, you look beautiful. Why thank you. This is my daughter, Jessie. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Do you want to sit in the front? Oh, okay. By the way, nice selfie on dad's phone. She saw our picture that he shot the other day so- - We were just having fun. Yeah it's a cute picture. Thank you. Are we ready to go? Come on. So Jesse, do you like Myrtle beach? Yeah, it's growing on me. I heard you met Zach. Oh yeah, we get along great, I think I kind of like him. What does your dad call him? Well, I call him the Carolina kid. Yeah, he's a hottie. Zach is a handsome boy, well I mean, young man. So what about you? Me? What about me? Do you like my dad? Honey come on. Well, we just met, but so far so good. You know, my dad hasn't dated anyone or had a girlfriend since mom passed. I think I got this. What? You probably have a little dust or rust from not dating for so long dad. So you go this huh? I hope so. Okay, well, you know what? I haven't dated for years. So I'm a little rusty myself. Well, you know what, to be honest, I do miss spending time with someone special too. You know what I miss, your home cooked meals. We've been eating out a lot since we arrived. Well, we can do something about that if you like. Oh, I have no idea. Maybe Mary Lou can come over tonight and I'll invite over Zach. Dad you can wow us with one of your gourmet meals. A real home cooked meal. And technically you guy's third date. Keeping track? Well good job there honey. Well, listen, Mary Lou, the ball's in your court, what do you want to do? I am not going to say no to a home cooked meal, come on now. All right well, dinner at eight and don't be late. Nice. All right. When are you going to open that up. Open her up right now. Now this box, is going to charge everything you see. Watch this all right. Oh my, can I touch it? Yeah, of course, go for it. It's not going to bite you. Wow, that is fascinating. You didn't do this. I sure did. So? Mm! Wow. This chicken is off the chain Mr. H. - I absolutely have to agree. - Good. It is delicious. What is it exactly? It's avocado chicken and pesto. Avocado what now? It's California Chicken. Yeah, it's, I blend the pesto and I grill the chicken and I do all the satay with the tomatoes and the- but the pesto is a secret, so I can't tell you what it is. It sounds like a lot of work. No, no work at all. He loves to cook, it's one of his passions. You know what makes me the happiest? Seeing you guys happy, my customers. Well you really outdid yourself dad. Mm, so good, thanks for the invite. My pleasure kiddo. Ah ahem, excuse me. What seems to be the problem Mrs. Haaz? Did you feed this young man? No, no, no, no. This looks familiar. This is weird. Howdy, been expecting you for some time now. You've been expecting me? Yeah boy, my name's Charlie. Come around back, I want to show you something. Come on, over here. Something else I want to show you. What is this place Charlie? Bob! Bob get out here, he's here. Holy Crap! Howdy Martin Haaz. He talks and he knows my name? Yup, we talk about you with my good buddy Charlie. Yup, I learnt him English. Hell, he talks gooder than me. Wait a second, you're an alien from another planet, you talk redneck English? Just somebody pinch me please. Ow! I was just kidding! What's kidding? It means not real Bobby. Joke maybe? Yeah, joke Bob. He's name is bob? Yup, named him myself. Hey Martin, you know what Bob spelled backwards is? It's B-O-B, Bob! Good thing right Martin Haaz? Yup he sleeps right here in this barn. He lives with you? Yup. Hey Martin do you want beer? A beer? Hell yeah, good stuff. You taught him how to drink beer? Oh yes, makes my head feel real good after about four. My head starts spinning, or maybe it's the room that's spinning, I'm not sure but I like it a lot. More than my space ship. Yeah you give ol' Bob a few beers, he'll sleep for hours, that way I get some sleep. Why do you want him to go to sleep? Well, he gets to yammering on about that alien space man crap and I just get a nasty headache. So, I give him a few beers, he really like it too. He came from another planet on a space ship? When did you come here? How long have you been here? That's a whole lot of questions. I need to get me another beer first. Okay. Bob loves beer. Oh, feels better. Martin, I'm not from this planet. He knows that Bob. I was on a mission of sorts. What kind of mission? I was searching for relief for my planet. Y'all's world was sending out so much information on them satellites. So much noise, it gave us all headaches. So I was sent out to find the problem and eliminate it. Orders from my boss. So you were detecting our satellites on your planet? So many messages, they never stop. No one could sleep on my planet, too much noise. And your boss sent you here on your space ship to seek and destroy our satellites. What's seek and destroy? Seek is to look for and destroy is- destroy. Yup, destroy. Seek satellites, stop noise, go back home. Why are you still here Bob? How many days ago Charlie? Five years Babo. Fives years your planet time, I was searching you all satellites, when all of a sudden, a strong blue beam hit my spaceship. The ship exploded and I fell from the sky and landed on Charlie's place. Can't go home, got no power, And I've been just trying to build my teleport circle up again. Yeah, he needs a lot of power to get moving. Following me so far Martin? Yeah Bob, keep talking. Bob needs your help Martin. So listen, you put that stuff in my head and the visions and the signs? Yes I did Martin, telepathic messages to the spot where the blue beam came from. Well you know what, that beam of light, that hit your spaceship, that wasn't from me, that was from my partner five years ago, from Tomcat. Well then he should come here and help me get home. Well Bob, he passed away in the explosion five years ago. So he won't be able to make it. And that's what happened, that blue beam of light destroyed your spaceship and that's how you landed here. You're here now, you can help me. Bob I don't have the slightest idea how to fix your ship, Your teleportation, I don't know. I'll send Pixel thoughts to your mind. I done read your mind a little bit already, I know you have the power source I need to get me home. Bob just needs your help Martin. I mean I like his company and all but it's been five years and he'd done drunk all my beer. And you should try feeding this giant, I mean, he eats a lot. But mostly Bob misses his family, wants to go home. All right Bob, I'll give it my best all right. I'll try to help you out. Thank you Martin. You got it Bob. Hey Ben, it's Marty, You're not going to believe what I just saw. What? What'd you see? Are you ready for this, here it goes. How long have you been an inventor? Oh, well inventor, scientist, well more like an engineer. When I was a little boy, I used to go to RadioShack, remember RadioShack? Oh my gosh, RadioShack? I used to go there, I used to buy, well, one of the things I bought there was a walkman, remember? Oh stop. Yeah, walkman, and I would buy fuses and cables and I would build this stuff, you know I just wanted to keep building and building. Most of the times I blew things up right in my parents' garage. Oh! I would blow them up over and over again until I was able to build something. And I became good, real good at it. And then finally I built the gem of all gems, my Blue Cube Radiatron, which I'm really proud of. What about you? I mean, is this your only marriage, you've been married before? Yes only one marriage, I did have a high school sweet heart. Yeah. I could have sworn he was the one. We were together seven years, 16 to 23. That's pretty good. Football jock, very fit, very handsome. Good. And then Billy, you know, the jealous, controlling bully. Do you know that I could not even go out with my girlfriends or take the dog on a walk without him accusing me of adultery somehow or I don't know. Anyway I got enough courage and strength to finally get a divorce but somehow he still manages to make my life miserable. I hate seeing live in fear. No one should live in fear, especially you. On a more positive note, please, - I loved meeting Jessie. - Aw thanks. She's so beautiful. Great sense of humor like her daddy. Well thank you, I'll take that as a compliment. Well you should, you're special. Well Mary Lou, you're a special woman. Thank you for dinner. It was my pleasure. But I gotta go. It's that time. You can stay. You don't think it's too soon for a sleepover? No. Promise? Promise. Come on. Well, well, well, don't we look happy this morning. Did you two? - Did we what? - What? Nothing, oh nothing. Oh no, you know it just got late, so we- - So we? You better what watch out there young lady, we, we nothing. Your dad is making his famous pancakes. Well Mary Lou you're in for a treat, my dad's pancakes are the bomb! As a matter of fact can you help us and set them on the table, thank you. How are you doing today? How do you think I'm doing? Really dad? You think you're actually gonna use that grill? I'm going to try. You know I've been stuck in a lab for 15 years, I though I might enjoy this beautiful day, Sunshine, have a barbecue. I know what it is. What? It's Mary Lou, she's got you all excited about life. Got that right. I'm thrilled to see you two together. You both seem so happy and that makes me happy. It's been a long time dad. I know, pretty sharp there kiddo. Get it from you and pops. Since you're here, I got something really important to tell you. Please have a seat. Cause you're not going to believe me okay. It's pretty, it's pretty crazy now. All right you know those signs that I've been having, the dreams and everything, right? Yeah, you told me. Okay I know what's going on, I really do. I went for a drive yesterday and I found the barn, the house that I've been seeing in my dreams. And I met a guy by the name of Charlie, okay? Charlie knew I was coming, it was crazy out of this world. What's so weird about that? That's just the beginning of the story, there's more to it. So Charlie introduced me to, okay, I'm about to tell you something crazy, please believe me. You're freaking me out. No, No! I'm serious. Okay. I promise. Okay. So Charlie introduced me to Bob, okay, Bob is an alien from another planet. I'm serious, his spaceship crashed about five years ago and he landed right on his barn. Believe me okay? Now, now Charlie's trying to build him a teleportation portal to send him back to his planet. And he needs me to help him. Now, there was a beam of light that destroyed his spaceship, That beam of light came from my lab. The same lab that exploded five years ago with Tom in it, Remember? That's a lot to digest. I know! So when do I get to meet this Bob and Charlie and see this tele portal thing? You really want to meet them? Yeah. We can leave in about five minutes, you can meet him if you like. Okay. All right, come on, let's go. You don't think I'm crazy. Well, that's pushing it. Come on. Hey Bob, Bob it's Marty, come out. Martin Haaz, you came back. Dad. Dad, a real alien. Whoa. Jessica Haaz, I meet you finally! I told you Bob, I'll bring my daughter. Jessica, this is Bob, Bob, this is my daughter, Jessica. Nice to meet you Bob. Happy to meet you too Jessie. Martin, shall we get started? All right, first of all I want to know where the heck do you come from? 14 light years away from here. So I got to go fast, real fast if I'm going to teleport back to my planet. How do you teleport in space? Well a teleportation machine is a transporter that will convert a human or an alien in this case into an energy pattern. Then they will be beamed up to a location and somehow reconverted back to themselves right? Yup. Yeah Martin Haaz, that's all we need to do. So how long does it take you to get home? Less than two minutes. Wow. So is anyone missing you back at home? Yeah, a lot of people. I've got a wife and two children, superiors and lots of friends. Wow you gotta get home. Dad, are you gonna help him? I am, I'm going to help him. Well! I thought I heard voices. Howdy Martin! Who's this young lady? Well, Charlie this is my daughter Jessie. Jessie, this is my good friend Charlie. Hi Charlie. Howdy do there daughter Jessie, nice to meet you. Jessie, you want a beer? I'd love one Bob. Well, she can't drink Bob, she's a teenager. What's a teenager and why don't they like beer? A teenager is a youngin' Bob. And youngins' don't drink beer. But that don't mean Charlie can't have one, toss that bad boy over here. Now let's get back to work people, and of course, alien over here. Yeah boy. Hey Charlie get me vice grip. Hold your damn horses, I ain't Speedy Gonzalez. Yeah what? Help me working. I'm working. Bob, Bob? Are you okay? Are you dead? Dad I think he's dead. No that's how he sleeps all the time. Don't worry, all he has to do is just bring him some beer put it next to his nostril, the one that looks like a nostril, and move it around, he'll wake up. Check it out. Hey Mary Lou. Oh! How are you doing? Good, how are you? So Good to see you. Good, it's good to see you- Let me see. Let me see please. The son of a bitch, I swear to God, come on! No, no. I'm going to kill this guy, I swear. It's all right, all right, it's okay. I don't want you in my mess. Your mess? This, your mess is my mess. I feel the same way about you, okay. Billy is a different kind of bad, okay, so please- - I got the perfect thing for the son of a bitch, I swear. No, no Martin please don't do nothing stupid, promise me, Please? Don't worry about me okay? Go put some ice on it okay? Come on! I can't do this! You know I don't have the right parts. I can't! Are you mad Martin? No I'm not mad, I'm just frustrated. I'm sorry Martin. I'm sorry Bob. Martin, you reckon we'll need this here part? I don't know whether to kiss you or to kick you. This is what I need! Well I don't think I want to be kissed or kicked by you Martin. This is what I've been looking for, this is the part that I need, thank you. You're welcome. Man! You know what I am going to need some help from you. What can I do you for Martin? I'm going to need a real favor from you if you don't mind. Anything you need Martin. You know what this needs a celebration. Oh beer! Yeah, you deserve it. You found the part, you're gonna help me out. Cheers! Cheers oh I love beer! Trying to enjoy my damn dinner. What can I do for you? Hello, Billy. Hey, you're that guy I saw hanging out with Mary Lou down at the boutique aren't you? That's right, I need you to pack all your crap and get out of town for good. Who's going to make me do that Martine? It's going to be me. You're going to pack your bags and leave South Carolina for good. If Mary Lou sent you down here, she's going to get hers, You can count on that, but as for you my friend- - I'm going to give it a last chance right here. I'm going to count to three and then you're going to pack your crap and get out of here. All right? No boy, that ain't how it's going to go. I'm going to count backwards from three on down to one, and then I'm going to smash your face in. Are you hearing me? I gave you the last chance here it goes. One, two, You should've listened to Martin! Now I'm gonna crush your head like a little beer can! No, No, please! Put me down! Please put me down! You know he sounds like a little weasel doesn't he? Should I suck the life from him now Martin? Should I let him suck the life out you punk? No! No please I'll move! I got a brother in Texas, I swear I'll go! Soon as this monster puts me down, I'll pack and I'm gone! I need you to do something for me, you're gonna leave Mary Lou for good. You're gonna pack your stuff and never see her again, you got it? Yes! I promise, I promise, I promise! I want you to call Mary Lou, and I want you to apologize for everything you ever done to her, you're also going to tell her that you will never come back to South Carolina ever again. You got that? Yeah, I got it! I got it! Bob put him down. That was great Bob! That was a lot of fun. You think we should get a nice ice cold beer? Hell yeah Martin, I love beer, it's so refreshing! You know what? I also think we should take a picture for Ben, he's going to love it. Here, look over here. Okay. Hi there. Hi. I need to talk to you about something. Mm hmm? So last night, Billy calls me and he starts telling me that he is sorry for everything he's ever done to me. And then he says, he's moving to Texas. To Texas? I mean who moves in the middle of the night? I guess Billy does. That's not all, he then mentions you and some eight foot alien named Bob. Eight foot alien named Bob? I mean he was talking so nutty and fast, I thought for sure he's drunk, right? Oh, right, right. Well, listen, I want to tell you something. No one will ever hurt you again. And I'm also going to tell you something really crazy but I want you to believe me. All right. All right, remember I told you I had that feeling. The reason why I'm here in South Carolina. I know what that feeling is. And I want you to see it. I can't really tell you about it because you won't believe me. So you have to see it with your own eyes. Oh Okay? So you have to come with me. Okay, where are we going? Well, come with me, let's go. Okay? Just trust me, baby, come on. All right. Come on Mary Lou. Come on. Come with me, I've got something to show you. What is this place Martin? This is the place. This is the barn that I was telling you about. Come on, come with me. Trust me. Mary Lou this is a teleportation circle for Bob. Okay? Wait. No. You got to trust me, believe me. What are you talking about? I know it sounds crazy but Bob is an alien from another planet. His spaceship crashed about five years ago and the only way he can get back home is by using teleportation. And this is it, right here. Where is here? What is this? This is the barn that belongs to Charlie. Who's Charlie? Charlie is Bob's best friend. I just want to go. Can we go? No, it's true. Hold on a sec. Hey Bob. It's Marty coming out. Mary Lou Lee it's nice to meet you! Bob, this is Mary Lou, Mary Lou, this is my friend Bob. Oh my gosh. Should we celebrate with a beer? Bob, no beer right now. Thank you though. You're not going to hurt me right Bob? Of course not! You're Martin's lady. So that makes you family Mary Lou Lee. Whoa, what do we have here? If this ain't the sun shining down on me like moonshine hitting my belly, Martin you have picked yourself the cream of the crop. Well, thank you, sir. Mary Lou this is my good friend Charlie and Charlie this is my girl Mary Lou. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance ma'am. And my dad add you about as pretty as a peach. Thank you. And I love what you did with the place. Well, it ain't much, but it's home. Okay. Good. Well, listen, you guys, we've been thinking that we've been working really hard and so maybe we could have a nice barbecue over our place this afternoon? - There you go. - Sound good. What's barbeque? It's a outdoor stove you cook on. Bob loves food! We'll be there. Hey, I'll bring the mountain oysters. Mountain oysters? You ever hear about taking the bull by the balls? Oh, you mean taking the bull by the horns? No, I mean taking the bull by the balls. You know what? We're good. We have enough food for everybody and we'll see you this afternoon. Okay you let me know if you change your mind! You got it. You got it. I'm thirsty. How about a beer. Bob loves beer. I might need two. Oh, we're running low. So you like our barbecue? Oh, I like it real good. So what's your favorite food? Pizza, Pop-Tarts, mostly beer. I'll be right back Bob. Here you go honey. You know what? That's right. Oh, I got a hot dog. You take a step back there buddy. Hey Bob, what you got there? Oh I got a hot dog. Oh is that your new favorite food here on earth? Oh I like hot dogs, but I love beer. I'm sure you do. Hey bud, you ever heard of a game called Frisbee we got here on earth? No I haven't. All right. Well, let's play some I'll teach you how you might want to put that plate down. You're going to be using both your hands for this. So I'm going to throw it to you like this and then you'll catch it like this. All right. Okay. So hands out. We'll try it. One, two, three. Well, that's all right. I got another one right here. We'll try it one more time. All right. You got it man! One, two, three. Bob loves Frisbee! Throw it back, I'll catch it now. You know, I'm glad Martin showed up and all, but once everything is fixed, and Bob goes home, well, I'm gonna be all alone again. I sure wish I could meet a pretty lady like you. Oh, that's sweet Charlie. Yeah, I'm not used to talking to pretty ladies. No ladies actually. I ain't to smart neither. No, you just got to get out more. There is someone for everybody. Hear me? Yeah. So, what'd you want to talk about? Well, Jesse, I really like you. I think you like me and we have fun and, and Bob's here and, and Mary Lou and your dad- - Did you ask me to be your girlfriend? I thought you'd never ask. Best be going now. The rewiring and sequencing is finished. As soon as I hook up the Radiatron to the motherboard, I know it's going to work. This works and I get home, I'll owe you my life. You and Charlie are my best earth friends Martin Haaz. Tomorrow, when I return home to my planet, I'll miss this here family. Well, you know what, Bob? It's not going to be the same without you, I'll tell you that much. Hello. Hi Bob, so are you married? Yes, but on my planet we call it kapau, which means ever in my world. I've got a wife and two children, but thanks to Martin I'm gonna see them again real soon. I'm reading your minds, this thing between you two is real good. I think it's going to be kapau everlasting. Hey, how about a toast. Bob, been five years, I'm gonna miss you buddy. Martin, if you hadn't shown up, none of this had been possible for old Bob. To friends, who I consider family now. And to always being there for each other, all right? To my earth family, tomorrow we say goodbye, but even being 14 light years apart you will remain in my heart. Martin do we drink the beer now? Yes, sir. Cheers! Yeah let's all drink! Hey there, Mr. Haaz, where do you want me to set this down? Oh yeah, just give them to Bob please, thank you. There you go. Thank young Zach. I'll tell you, this is looking pretty badass. Thanks. All right, here we go guys. All right Zach, I think it's best you take cover. I'll fire it up, okay? Nothing, no power, it ain't working Martin. Can you try one more time Martin? Bob I don't know what's going on, Let me try something else, I'm sorry. Check in one more time Martin. Nothing Bob. What are we going to do? I don't know. What's wrong? It won't start. The cube didn't work. Come on, there must be something you can do to fix it. Don't worry Bob, my dad will fix the cube and you'll get home okay? Listen, the cube is not powering the teleportation system somehow. Well fix it dammit! Dad back at the lab you guys could troubleshoot any problem. You're right, that's it honey. Yeah? Hey Ben, what's up my friend it's me. Nothing much, how about you? Look, I need your help. The Radiatron is not sending power to the teleportation system. And I spent the last few weeks rewiring, recoding everything, but when we try to power it up, we got nothing. Did you check all the connections to the cube? Yes, of course I did everything. Did you see if there was any frayed wiring, anything like that? Yes. Yes I did. Okay, I'm going to need to see the cube to see if there's anything wrong with all the connections, all that, okay? Okay, hang on, I'll facetime you now, okay? All right, got it. I'm going to turn the camera so you can see the machine. There you go. Move the phone to the left. Okay. Back to the right. How's that? Got it right there, perfect. Talk to me, what do you see? I see the problem, this is so simple, I can't believe you didn't figure it out. Tell him now. Oh, okay, all right, all right. You're missing a power converter, You'll need to plug directly into the teleporter's power source. Put the converter between the two power sources and turn it to at least 42,000 amps. Thanks man, we'll talk soon! All right Bob, we've used up all the marbles, okay? You ready? Ready. Here goes nothing. Holy shit, it's time to go! Wait, you're not leaving now? Not without saying goodbye. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! You fixed it now you done broke it! No, Charlie, I just turned it off. Why? To say my goodbyes. All right Bob, this is it. Martin! Send Mary Lou out here right now or you're all gonna die! All right Jessie, you take Mary Lou in the back. I got it, please, take her in the back now. Go, go in the back, hide. All right guys, Bob, we got this. We're gonna need your help okay? We'll go on out front, and then we'll call you. Come on guys. Mary Lou you better get over here right now, or everybody with you is going to get hurt real bad. You didn't listen to me the first time did you? You know what Martine? I ain't as stupid as everybody thinks. I've been thinking about it. I think that monster you brought to my house the other night was some kind of fancy Halloween costume or special effect. I know there ain't no such thing as aliens. We ain't scared of you, right boys! A bunch of Halloween bull crap is all it was. Trick or treating is over boy! That's right! I'm gonna tear you up! Mary Lou! Get over here, now! You better pack in get in your trucks and get out. Tell you what Martine, you're fixing to get hurt, real bad, I'm gonna show you good. We come for a fight! Here's your fight boys. That's great Bob. Bob? Is they dead? No, they're sleeping. Bob, can I have a hug? I was a true pleasure Bob. Y'all have given me the best gifts in the world. Your friendship, you're sending me home to my family. I'm going to miss all y'all. Bob, you brought us here to South Carolina, you mean the world to us, thank you. Bob, it's been a real trip mate. Now you four take care of each other, and keep an eye on Charlie. Oh, wait, talking about Charlie, Where is Charlie? Here I am, come on man, you didn't think I let you leave without your favorite stuff did you? Charlie! Get out of here you big lug. I'm gonna be right here. Yeah buddy. Hey Bob, my friend, we're gonna miss you. Do you Mary Lou Lee, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband. I do. And do you Martin Haaz, take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? I do. By the power vested in me. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your lovely bride. Oh yeah! Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. and Mrs. Haaz. Martin and Mary Lou came into my life a year ago, and they and them kids there, well they're family now.
