(music) - ANNOUNCER: Please welcome Sebastian Maniscalco. (cheering and applause) - SEBASTIAN: So good, so good to be here, man. What a year. God, if you should know anything about me, I got a problem... with people and... how they behave, you know? I kind of grew up with, like, a list of rules to kind of live by. My parents kind of gave me a book on how to live, and apparently nobody got the book. Went to Starbucks. Every day that's all I do, is I watch people and I get upset. I can't take it. I'm at the Starbucks. This woman ordered a scone, a muffin-- I don't know what the hell it was, but they gave it to her in a brown bag and then she was eating it-- she was, like, fingering the muffin out of the bag. (laughter) Take it out of the bag! Get a plate! What the...? (laughter) What, are you eating crumbs? I can't take-- everywhere I go there's a problem. You can't even go to the mall. I used to go to the mall all the time. It was a nice place to kind of unwind, but now they got these little-- these huts in the middle of the mall. These little kiosks-- what is this? I don't buy anything out of a hut. I don't even know if the hut's going to be there tomorrow if I have a problem with the product. These things are on wheels. They could be three miles down the road in no time. But we used to own that part of the mall. That's where we made decisions-- in the middle of the mall, right? Remember, you used to go with your family? You used to go, "Where you going?" "I'm going to Sears. Where you going?" "JCPenney. We meet back here in one hour." Now you can't do that because you, you see a hut. You'll be walking with your girl, you'll look up there, you're like, "Oh, come on, what do we got to put up with? What is this hut?" (laughter) 'Cause these people that work in the huts are aggressive. These sales techniques are very aggressive. You ever get attacked with cream? Man, you'll be walking, and out of nowhere... (in Middle Eastern accent): "You want to try cream? Try cream. Is good, is from Israel. It's good cream." It's hand lotion. They act like they've got something that we've never seen before. Who's trying the cream and going, "Oh, my God. I'm soft. What the hell is this stuff? You have bottles of this back there?" Weird stuff are happening in these huts. They're threading eyebrows. Have you seen this? A woman is laying down and someone is just... (laughter) There's eyebrow shrapnel flying everywhere. Landing in my Auntie Anne's. World is changing, man. After the mall, I went to Subway. Why is this a problem-- getting a sandwich? It's a sandwich. I got behind a lady-- it looked like it was her first time out ever. Just a look of confusion, bewilderment. Came up to the counter. (laughter) "How does this work here? What do you do?" It says "Step one: pick bread." You don't see that? (laughter) How do you make a sandwich at home? What, do you start throwing ham all over the table? (laughter) Pick the bread! Then she saw the condiments, her head almost popped off her body. She was sitting there, looking at the condiments, telling the guy, "Not that tomato, no, the third one underneath that one on the side. I want that tomato." It's not a puppy. Making up the-- there's rules at Subway you got to follow. This woman's like, "I don't want any of the cucumbers or olives, so double up on the turkey." It don't work that way. The sandwich is five dollars. There's a net profit of four cents on that. And you want double meat for no veg? And I feel for the guy working there. Got to sit there and listen to this all day. He's like... (in Hispanic accent): "I can't do it, I can't do it. They got cameras, they're looking at me, come on! What do you want?" I got no patience for this. Just keep it moving. When you're out, just, just keep... I don't hold it up. The guy asks me, "What, what do you want on your sandwich?" I told him, "Run it through the garden." (laughter) (applause and cheering) It's everywhere you go. Grocery store-- that's always a problem, right? Customer service-- they gave up. The grocery store gave up on us. They put in self express checkout lanes. They basically said, "You know what? You do it." Why am I working at the grocery store now? Do you ever look over there? Nobody knows what's going on. It's a bundle of confusion. Right, there's always a guy sitting there with, like, some artichokes going... (laughter) We weren't properly trained on this machine. Those people go through a three- week training on this computer, and we're just jumping in on it? Again, I never want to be the problem, okay? So my grocery store is open 24 hours a day. You know what I did? I went in at 3:00 a.m. Nobody there. I did a self-training on this machine. I got all the different screens down. I memorized some of my favorite items. 4162-- bananas. I know this stuff... so on a Saturday at 3:00 in the afternoon when it's packed, I'm cooking. I'm helping out other people. (laughter) But I was in the human line. I'm sitting there. My line ain't moving. Had a price check. You ever get this? They're sitting there, they scan the steak, price doesn't show up. Now they have to turn and ask Timmy the bagger... to go find out what the T-bone steak costs, and that person's always like, "Yes, Timmy, could you plea-- please go find out for me?" And now you hear the whole line just get deflated... and pissed off at this one person because they didn't pick out the right steak. I never want to be the problem. If they scan my steak and it doesn't show up, you know what I tell the cashier? "Forget it, I don't need it. Keep it going." You think I'm gonna wait for Timmy? Timmy don't even know he's working. This kid leaves here, he ain't coming back. Was there even an interview with this kid? I don't know, I'm looking at the bagger, he's got a rainbow Mohawk, right? Then he's got this-- I don't know what it is-- if it's an earring. You ever see this? It looked like somebody took a shotgun and blew a hole through his ear and then they put magnets in his earlobe. Do you know what would happen to me if I ever came home as a kid with magnets hanging out of my ear? My father would throw me against the refrigerator. (laughter) So I'm in line. I'm... I don't know-- trying to be green. It's hard, okay? I got plastic this time. Right? The whole line got upset. I could tell, the whole line got upset I'm getting the plastic bags. I go, "Yeah, I have plastic." And the whole line's, like, "Oh!" (laughter) "He's not green." 'Cause they all brought their bag. Made out of wheat. (laughter) You know what I do when I see that? "Double bag it." (laughter) It's hot. I get frustrated when I talk about this stuff. Right? You ever see somebody leave the grocery store, and the alarm go off? (laughter) That alarm'll constantly go off. People walk off, right, and all of a sudden, they hear... (imitates alarm): Boo, boo, boo. (laughter) And what do they always tell you? "You're good. (laughter) Go ahead. You're good." You can have nine steaks down your pants. "Go ahead, take off. Steal it." (laughter) So you get heated, man, when you're out. Got to stop off, maybe cool off. What's with...? This whole town's going nuts with yogurt. What's going on... with yogurt? (laughter) Everybody's dying for yogurt. They see, like, a... a Pinkberry. They're, like, "I want to go get some Pinkberry." (laughter) Oh, I'm not a yogurt guy, but I had to go look to see what the problem was. (laughter) I'm sitting in line. I'm watching people eat the yogurt. First of all, everybody had a sample before they got... What is with the sampling? I don't... I don't do samples. (laughter) Oh, these two women came up, so proud of themselves. They're, like, "Excuse me. Do you have some pomegra... Do you have the pomegranate? Could we try the pomegranate?" (laughter) They were so happy, they were gonna get a free lick. (laughter) Now the guy's got to turn around, he's got to fill up a little Dixie lick cup. (laughter) And he hands it out. Grown women, but they're like kids when they get it. They're, like... (high-pitched laughing) "This is good! I like this one." (laughter) I don't do any of this. I just got the green tea. If I don't like it, yeah, I fucked up. (laughter) (in high-pitched voice): "What?" (applause) You think I'm gonna hold up 12 people's day licking a...? (laughing) "Yeah..." (laughter) Driving-- that's another thing I can't do. You ever get behind someone, they're not moving? They're not moving, right? You're, like... (guttural grunting) (laughter) Right? You're, like... You change into an animal. (laughter) (grunting) (roaring) (laughter) Right, you're just looking for the pass lane. You're looking to pass them. And it seems like it's days. It takes days for this to happen. But you'll finally get it, right? You'll finally get it, but as you pass, you can't let this go. As you pass them, you have to turn and look to see who the hell is driving this way. (laughter) You can't go to bed at night without putting a face to that miles per hour. (laughter) And I don't know what happens to us. As we pass, we lose it. We're, like, "What the hell are you doing?!" (laughter) Sometimes you want to just slow up so they could see the face. You pull up, and you're, like, "Look at what you did to me! (laughter) I was happy a mile ago! Look at this transformation!" (laughter) And sometimes you got to go back to your house and regroup, right? I was sitting in my house a couple weeks ago, just relaxing. My doorbell rang. This is weird. It's a different feeling when your doorbell rings today, opposed to 20 years ago, right? 20 years ago, your doorbell rang-- that was a happy moment in your house. (laughter) It was called company. (laughter) You'd be sitting there on a Thursday night watching TV. Your doorbell rang, the whole family shot off the couch. "Oh, my God! Put the lights on. Somebody's here. We got people." (laughter) Right? The whole family went to the door. (laughter) The kids were in socks. They slid up to the door. (laughter) Nobody looked to see who it was. Right, you just opened up the door. You were, like, "Oh, my God, look at that." (laughter) "Look at who's here." And you're asking, "What the hell are you doing here?" And the person would be, like, "I was in the neighborhood. I thought I might stop by, see how the kids are doing." They're, like, "Oh, come on in. We're gonna have some cake." (laughter) Your mother had a little Entenmann's. Maybe some Sara Lee crumble cake just in case company came over. She made an announcement when she bought it. She's, like, "Listen, nobody touch this cake. This is for company only. Those crap muffins-- those are for you people. (laughter) You better hope to God somebody comes over so we can cut the cake." (laughter) She put her cake in the middle of the table, proud of it. Right, she put it right in the middle. "Cut yourself a slice. Want a cup of coffee? We're gonna do coff... Want some Sanka?" (laughter) Yeah, that's old school. Lot of the young kids are looking at me, like, "What is that, an iPhone app? (laughter) What the hell is Sanka?" Your mother had a tin, a brown and orange tin of Sanka ready to go just in case the company. She'd put a big pot on the table. "Go ahead." Nobody had a cell phone back then. If your cell... If your house phone did ring, your father stood up and said, "Nobody get that phone. We got company." (laughter) And you lost track of time. Two hours went by. You were, like, "We got to get out of here." "That's okay. Next time, we're gonna come by you." Be, like, "Yeah, my door's always open." Now your doorbell rings? (laughter) It's, like, "What the fuck?!" (laughter) (laughter continues) All right, your old mother's crawling across the kitchen floor. "Get down, Ma! Army crawl! Army crawl. Get in the closet. Go get the sword in the living room. Somebody get the sword underneath the couch in the living room. There's a sword." (laughter) Right, you have to turn and ask your family, "You invite anybody over? You invite anybody over?" (laughter) There's always that person upstairs that didn't hear the bell. They come walking down. "What the hell is going on?" "Get the hell down! Somebody's outside! They're at the door. I think they saw movement." (laughter) "Oh, God, I got to open it. I got no cake, I got no Sanka, I got nothing. I got nothing for these people." (laughter) You can't stop by anybody's house anymore. If you do, you have to call from the driveway. (laughter) You're, like, "I'm here. Can I approach? (laughter) It's me and three other people. We're gonna walk up through the side... Is that your mother with a sword? Why does she have a sword?" (laughter) It's all changing, man. And if you want to see a big change and see what's happening in the United States, get called in for jury duty. (laughter) Last week, I was at jury duty the whole week. Am I the only one going to this stuff? (laughter) I called my friends, "You going?" "Nah, we shred it." (laughter) "What?" (laughter) So I go-- 7:30 in the morning, right, 300 people. Right, you sit there in this little room, right, and I don't know, man, we're in trouble as a country. If you want to get a temperature gauge on what society is looking like, go to jury duty. They say it's a, uh... jury of your peers. The people there are one step away from being a defendant. Now, it's-- nobody knows how to... follow instruction. The guy's up there-- it's simple. "Name." "Okay, name," right? "Address." "Address." And people are like, "Wha...?" Then he opens it up for questions. "Any questions?" Worst thing you could do to the general public is start opening up a questions session. The hands that shot-- this woman's shoulder almost popped off. People love to hear themselves speak. "I have a medical condition." Nobody gives a shit. Fill out the form and go to the courtroom. The guy next to me, in broken English, asked me how to put his name tag into the laminate. And I'm like, "You're going to determine... ...whether somebody goes to prison? And you're having problems with the name badge?" You need a release, right? You need to go out, you need to do stuff like this. Friday night comes out. "Come on, we're going out, we're going to do stuff." Right? I went out last week to a nightclub. I can't do this anymore. I'm getting way too old for the nightclubs. You know you're old when you walk into a nightclub and you're like, "Is it loud in here?" (laughter and applause) "Why is my hair vibrating?" I can't dance anymore. I used to bounce around. I was able to dance. Used to go out in my early 20s. I had my Cavariccis on. Right, I had that belt that shot down. Used to ask girls to dance. That's what we did-- we went out dancing. All week long, we practiced at the house. (laughter) And then Friday night we tested it out. Guys would have confidence, man. Girls would be hanging out by the bar. Guy would have enough confidence to pick out the one he wanted, then ask her to dance. Real cool, we'd come up and be like, "Hey... how you doing? You want to dance with me?" And she'd turn around, she'd be like, "Yeah. I'll dance with you." She'd turn to her girlfriends. "Hold my purse, Joanne." And you'd go out to the dance floor. You wouldn't touch one another. Very respectful-- you'd just watch each other move. You'd be like, "Yeah." (laughter) Right, you have that stupid dance face. (laughter) You'd lean in. "You look fantastic." (laughter) Then you would go to the bar 'cause that song would come in that nobody could dance to, right? That song would always pop on. Like, "I can't dance to this. I can't dance to Whitesnake. Let's go get a drink at the bar." So you would go to the bar. This is where you would have to have a little personality, flirt with her, right? I grew up with a bunch of guys. We were all funny. That's all we do-- make fun, goof around with girls, make them laugh. Girls would be like, "Oh, you guys are funny." I'd be like, "Yeah, I know." You would go in for the kill, you would get the number like, "Why don't you write your number down on a napkin? I'll take you out for steak next week, huh?" And you would get the number on a napkin. It was kind of damp, right? The ink would bleed a little bit. Before you left the club, you got to ask her, "Excuse me, sweetheart, is this a seven? Did you write a seven?" You give your number out now, five minutes later you get a text message-- "What are you doing?" "What do you mean, what I'm do...? I just met you. Back off." It's weird now at these clubs. It's embarrassing. Men look like predators. They look like predators on the dance floor. They don't ask girls anymore. They just come right behind 'em. They're like... (laughter) (Sebastian laughs) This is flirting? Somebody want to call the authorities? Nightclubs. Go to the bathroom at a nightclub, it's a whole different subculture in the bathroom. They got a bathroom attendant in the bathroom. They put this guy in there about 15 years ago... and his sole job is to give you a towel after you're done washing your hands from here to your hands. Now, I don't know if that was a problem for people. I don't know if people were coming out of the bathroom wet. "What do I do?! I'm wet." So management said, you know, "Listen, they're not grasping the concept. They're coming out, they're drenched, they're soaked. We need to put a guy in there to distribute towels." And as soon as you walk in and you see him, you get pissed off that he's even there, right? You walk in, you see him, you're like, "Oh, God! They got a guy?" It's weird. Now you got to talk to him after you're done. You're like, "Yeah, it smells like crap in here, huh?" And you got to tip him a dollar for the towel for what? I could see if I took a crap in the sink. "There you go, man, sorry about that. Little screwed up tonight. You want to wash that out? Maybe light a match, some Febreze, a candle. Do something. I'll give you a dollar." It's weird, man, but the world's changing. I don't know what's wrong with people. Go to the club. They got-- everybody's got a tattoo now. Oh, my God, I can't believe it. All the guys will get one, right? They'll put one on their bicep. Now every shirt becomes a sleeveless. They got to billboard their tattoo. They got to show it off because there's like an emotional meaning behind it, right? Some idiot will come up. "Excuse me, hi, I'm sorry. What's the significance? Why do you have a cobra head on your bicep? What...?" Now the guy gets all emotional. He's like... "Thanks for asking. The reason I got the cobra is, five years ago my father got... Excuse me. My father got bit by a snake. So to remember him by, I put the snake head on my bi-- it's not done yet." It's never done, right? They always got to go back, get shading. "2019-- I'm going to have the whole cobra all over my body. For now it's just the head, but what's going to happen-- it's going to drape across my chest. It's going to cascade down my torso, the tail's going to wrap around my nut bag. Aw, don't laugh, it's for my dad, you know? It's going to creep around my back, the rattle's going to tickle my nipple. And on my nipple, it's going to say 'Dad. Rest in peace,' you know." What the hell are you doing to yourself? What, did you forget he died? What, do you look down in the shower...? "Oh, yeah!" (mouthing) People ask me all the time, "Sebastian, why don't you have-- why don't you get a tattoo?" I go, "I don't put bumper stickers on Ferraris." (applause) Right? (cheering) Whoo! That's what we do, we go out. As a society, that's all we do, is go out. Go out to dinner with your friends. That always gets weird... especially if you go out with a group and you go off to anything like a dinner, whatnot, and when the bill comes, it gets weird. 'Cause what normally happens is the bill will travel around the table. People will then begin to pitch in what they think they owe. The problem with this is, there's always somebody last to get the bill. A look of confusion and concern comes over their face. They're like... (mumbling) Now, people see this and they're like, "Oh, need a couple extra dollars or something like that?" And you're like, "Well, I'm $687 short. So the two bucks you're going to pitch in ain't even going to put a dent in this. So how about this? How about the bill take another lap, do another lap? I don't think my chicken tenders were $700." That's one way it might work, right? Sometimes you'll be out to the dinner and somebody picks up the bill at your table. Now, there's a game involved with this. If somebody's nice enough to pick up a bill, you just don't go, "Hey, thanks." No, there's a game. Somebody takes the bill off the table, you have to stand up and lunge-- lunge for the bill. You lunge but you don't touch it. 'Cause if you touch it, you might end up with it. You're like, "I never wanted it, I just wanted to act like I did." So you stop shy. "What?" And you act like you don't know-- you know exactly what's going on, but you have to act like you don't. You're like, "Come on, what are you doing with that? Come..." Now, the person will go, "Please, come on. I'm making a lot of money, you know that. I got this tonight, huh?" The person doesn't sit down. You have to come back with number two, right? Now you go fish for the money. You're like, "That's ridiculous. That's a lot of money. Hold on here, right?" And you go for the money, but the money's back here. You just shake a pocket... hoping they cut you off. If that person has any class, they're like, "Please, come on now, you're embarrassing yourself. I got this. Get it next time." You have to come back with number three. "At least let me leave that tip, now, come on, huh?" Now, the person will then say, "You're money's foreign. I got it all." Now, I've been in situations where I go, "L-Le-Let me leave the tip," and the person's like, "Sure, go ahead." I'm like, "You cheap bastard." (mouthing) You might go out with a group, you might go on a date. Some people go dating, right? It's what a lot of us are doing, right? Nice couple here, hugging her, snuggling, gripping onto her. "That's my girl." It's nice, it's what love's all about. The first date's the big date, though, right? You go on a first date, there's a lot of flags. Lot of red flags going off on that first date. I watch, I watch how a woman eats. This is a huge deal breaker for me, okay? Took a girl out a couple months ago for Italian. She ate everything on the plate. I got no problem with that. - WOMAN: Yeah! - SEBASTIAN: Yeah, but... (laughter) I got no problem. Do it all you want. The problem I had is, she then took a piece of bread and did a sponge job. (laughter) My father does that during the holidays. You might want to wait till we fall in love until you start mopping up sauce... with bread fragments. Another deal breaker-- when I go to the girl's house for the first time. Ladies, be prepared for the come-over, okay? Have some options for me. You come to my place, I'm ready for you. I have it. It's like a hotel. Soon as we walk in, I turn around. "Want a little Diet Coke, apple juice, wine? What do you want?" I got Orangina. Nobody's got Orangina. Throw that at a chick-- "You want a glass of Orangina?" "You have Orangina?" "Yeah, I got it. Sit down." This girl had nothing. We walked in, she turned around, she's like, "You want some water or something like that?" "Water? I'll get that out of the hose." (mouthing) Little things bother me, I don't know. Another girl-- she offered me some Scotch. I said, "Yeah, could you put that on the rocks?" So she brought it out. I went to go take a sip. (sniffs) I smelled the ice cubes. The ice cubes smelled like her freezer. I'm like, "What, what is this, Johnnie Walker and mixed vegetables? Change out your cubes!" Every three days, I'm breaking cubes at my house, fresh. That's what we do, though. Dating in the beginning is cute, though. God, everything's adorable, isn't it? Nobody can do any wrong. You guys been dating for a while? - MAN: About a year. - SEBASTIAN: Yeah, a year. It's cute, right? There's no arguments, everything's adorable. He walks in the kitchen, she's got, like, a little broccoli hanging off her head. It's the cutest thing he's ever seen. He comes in, he's still flirting. He's like, "Baby, you got a... You got a piece of broccoli hanging off of your head." She flirts right back. She's like, "Oh... sorry." (laughter) (mouthing) You get married, you have kids, that ain't funny anymore. Little things are pissing you off about that person. Never bothered you in the beginning, right? Now, little things-- just the way somebody brushes their teeth in the morning could set you off. You walk in, you look at 'em in the mirror, you're like, "Oh, look at this shit." (laughter) "I hate you." Right? You might get engaged. The next step. Now, most guys... I like a classic go to a knee-- that's what I think men should do. Drop to one knee. I think that's what about 90% of the guys do, right? As soon as the guy goes to the knee, as soon as he does this, the girl sees what's happening-- she gets excited. She's like, "Oh!" (laughter) Right? The guy will drop down, he'll get a little emotional, like, "Baby..." (sniffles) "We've been dating for 18 years, you know." (laughter) "I know you're 48, probably can't have kids anymore. I think I'm done clubbing. I think I should, maybe settle down, you know." And you put the ring on her finger and she's like, "Yes." Some guys get stupid with it, right? They'll be out at dinner, they'll be sitting there, and the guy will be like, "Look in the mashed potatoes." "Yes." (laughter) Now you've got to plan the wedding. I come from an Italian family. Italians do it a lot different than most people when it comes to weddings, okay? Italians don't register at Bed, Bath & Beyond. We don't bring a toaster to a wedding. Italians bring cash, okay? Yeah, we put it in an envelope. Sometimes there's not even a card. There's just cash with a post-it note. "Congrats." Now the bride and groom know they're getting cash. They're sitting there with a satin bag that says "Cash" and diamonds. And people walk in and, you know, they start making a deposit. Now some people don't give the cash right away. They hold on to it. They wait till dinner's served. Right? They go to dinner, they'll have the dinner, they're eating the chicken, right? They go, "Chicken's kind of dry. Take a hundred out of the envelope. The food stinks, take a hundred out." Then at the end of the wedding, the bride and groom they go up to the room, and before they do anything, they start opening up these envelopes. Now the groom takes out a black log book. And what they're going to do, they're going to log the amount and the name in of everybody that came to the wedding, right? So the guy will be, "What the Pantangeles leave?" She's like, "Ten dollars." He's like, "Cheap bastard. Ten dollars." The reason for this book is when the Pantangeles get married, you go back to the book and you look-- Pantangeles... "Put ten singles in that envelope and tell them to go screw themselves." (laughter) That's how I did it. My father-- cash, that's all he... he had a wad of cash growing up, no wallet. Just a wad, just a big knot with a broccoli band around the wad. We'd negotiate. My father would negotiate prices at Sears. It was embarrassing to go shopping with the guy. The salesman didn't know what the hell was going on. (laughter) The salesman's like, "The refrigerator's going to be about $1,200 here." My father would be like, "No, it's not. We're gonna pay cash." And the salesman was like, "Yeah, we accept cash, sir. $1,200." My dad's like, "Cash. What's the price going to be with cash?" It's not a flea market, we're at Sears. I didn't grow up in a huge family, right? I got a sister. But I don't know, I don't know if I want to have kids of my own. It's coming to a point now where my friends all have kids. They're always asking me, "Sebastian, when are you...?" And I go "I don't know if I want kids." They're like, "What? Oh, Se- no. Sebastian, kids are a miracle. It's an amazing thing. Once you have one of your own, it's not about you anymore. It's about them." Why the hell would I want to do that? (laughter and applause) And it's not the kids I got a problem with. It's the parents today. It's a different parent than how we grew up. First of all, is everybody's kid fantastic? (laughter) Why is everybody bragging about their kids? Don't we have any dumb kids anymore? (laughter) My parents were honest with people. They never bragged about me. We went to the aunts and the uncles. As soon as we walked in, my father was like, "Yeah, we don't know what the hell's wrong with him. I don't know, something's off with this kid. Something's loose. Look at how big his head is. Look at the head on this kid." Right, they put me in the base... "Go in the basement, play Pong." Right? Now I've got my friends always coming over with the kids bragging. "Sebastian, she's so advanced. She's reading at a fourth grade level, she's only in second grade. Show Sebastian the face-- show the face you make." I don't give a shit. (laughter) If your kid could fly from my backyard to the front yard, yeah, I might want to see that. "She's unbelievable! How's it happening?!" But whatever your kid does, nobody cares. They got their kid in every sport nowadays. Every activity. What are you doing? The kid's exhausted. Pick one thing for this kid to do. But no, the father, the mother can't fathom that the child just might not be good at something. It's never the kid's fault for lack of talent. It's the coach. You ever get this family? They got to complain to the coach. They come up the the coach, "Coach, want to come here? Yeah. Hi, we're the Gibsons. Just wondering why my child Tyler's not participating in the game with the rest of the kids." "'Cause he stinks. That's why we got a bench." (laughter) Not everybody's a winner. Not everybody gets a trophy. You know who got the trophy when I was growing up? First place got the trophy, right? (applause) Yeah, that's it. It inspires competition. Right? They don't even keep score in the games. I couldn't believe it. I came to my buddy's kid's game late. I said, "George, I'm sorry I'm late. What's the score?" He's like, "Shh. We don't-- we don't keep score out there. All those kids are winners out there." "Are you watching the same game I'm watching? Kid's running the wrong way." (laughter) I didn't grow up this way. My parents prepared me for life. Disappointment, failure. They put me in basketball. (laughter) They came to the first game at halftime. My father sprinted down from the stands, like, "Get the hell in the car! You suck!" He was apologizing to the coach. He's like, "I'm sorry you had to watch that. I don't know what the hell he was doing out there." Even I knew I was bad while I was doing it. I'm like... "I don't feel good! Get me off!" He pulled me right off the court. He's like, "Listen, you humiliated yourself, you embarrassed our entire family. People took off work to watch what you just did. Get in the trunk." Italians, we don't play basketball. When's the last time you put an NBA game on and said, "Take a shot, Nunzio." It doesn't happen. "Put in Carmine for the three." No. Italians, what do we do? Cement, nice cement driveway. Meatball sandwich. Give us a church, we'll paint the whole ceiling. I mean... Certain cultures do certain things well, right? Italians generally do not go into the medical field, right? Have you ever went to an emergency room, and like, this is your doctor-- Dr. Acualani? I'm like, "Wait a minute, you got a Ginsberg back there? A Lipowitz, a Folkenberg, somebody I knew that studied?" (laughter) Eh, come on. But it's culture based when it comes to raising kids. The culture that's got it down to a science, in my personal opinion, are these Japanese people. We got any Japanese tonight? (woman murmurs) Right. You're Japanese? Half. Half. I knew she wasn't 100% because Japanese people are... (whispers): ...quiet. (laughter) I never ask that question-- 100% Japanese? "Yeah, we're here!" It doesn't happen. That was her other half coming out. Japanese people-- well-mannered people. You ever look at their kids at a restaurant? They're trained. They sit there at a 90-degree angle. They're like soldiers, they don't move. They make one slight move, the father is like, (imitating Japanese speech) (laughter) You ever see the white kid at the restaurant? In half a diaper? Mother just sitting there, "Ha, ha, isn't he cute? Look." No, you know what's cute? The two-year-old Japanese kid in a suit eating with sticks. (laughter and applause) Huh? Asking for the check. Two years old in third grade. But you have a family, maybe. It's hard to stay married, peaks and valleys. A lot of men veer off the path of monogamy, right? Celebrities do it all the time. And the media focuses in on these celebrities. Mostly guys, right? Probably the biggest celebrity to ever veer off the path is Tiger Woods, right? And they put the guy in a sex addiction clinic. That's what they do nowadays. They put people in sex addiction clinics. There is no such thing as a sex addict, okay? How do you know you got a problem with sex? You hit a certain number? You're, like, "I need help." This whole thing is a scam. The only guys that are at the sex clinic are guys that are married and got caught. There's no single guys at the clinic. There's no single guys banging on the door. "What's the problem?" "I don't know. I'm having too much sex out here. Something's wrong with me. It's awful. My buddies are laughing at me. I don't know who's coming and going." Anytime any of this stuff happens, it ignites conversation in house between men and women, right? A lot of women sit there and watch it on ESPN or CNN. They're, like, "Could you believe what he's doing? Could you believe this?" A lot of guys have to sit there and act, "What?" "How many girlfriends does he have? 17? That's disgusting! Shut it off. I can't even watch." Some women, they take it a step further. They compare the celebrity relationship with their own. You can't do this. Two different worlds, right? Tiger Woods worth a billion dollars. And women were sitting there, "Would you do this? Would you do...? Look at me! Would you do this?" You can't ask your guy that. If you ask them, you'd have to, guys would have to say, "Listen, honey, the guy's worth a billion. If I was worth a billion, I wouldn't be with you. I'm working at Wal-Mart. This is the best I could do." Come on. Do you think the guy at Wal-Mart is dealing with the same temptations that Tiger Woods is dealing with? Do you think there's six-foot blonde Scandinavian models walking in the Wal-Mart asking the stock guy, "Hey... you want a little of that? Tell me where your towels are, this is all yours." It's getting weird, man. The world is changing, and I don't know if it's for the better. A lot of technologies out there. I'm not into it, right? Craigslist is a big, big web site. People go there. First of all, have you gone to the craigslist Web site? It looks like it came out when the Internet came out. Does anybody want to put up some flash? Looks like Braille. I don't know. But people sell stuff on this with no problem. I don't know. I can't do this. It's weird. This Craigslist, you don't know who's coming to your house, right? It's like an invitation to get murdered. Just put up the posting: "Area rug for sale. Come murder me and my family." You don't know what you're getting! We used to have a garage sale. That's how we did it. We just threw the garbage on a Saturday morning. We just threw it out on the driveway. We put some signs all over town with an arrow: "Come get our garbage." And the weirdest people would show up to your home. You would have, like, a table with a cash box and the garage open, but you would just watch people mill around your yard, right? They'd come out of their car. Someone would get a little too close to the house, you're, like, "Back up, back off. Back off. What do you want? Tell me right from there what you want." "Can we use your bathroom?" "Bathroom? Get the hell off my property. It's not Wal-Mart. It's a shit sale. Pick what you need and leave." And whatever we didn't sell, we threw it out. But we broke it before we threw it in the garbage. That's my father. He's, like, "If they're not gonna buy it at my sale, they're not gonna come by later on tonight and steal it out of my my garbage. Saw the couch in half." What? 12 years old, I'm sawing it. He's, like, "Burn all the lamps, burn all these lamps, pop the eyeballs out of the teddy bear, and then decapitate the head. You throw the head out on Tuesday and then the body out on Saturday. I know who was looking at this bear, and when they come back and find out there's no eyeballs or no body, they're not gonna want a head. It's a weird, weird culture out there, man. Like I said, technology is taking over. My father wants to get involved with it. Now, my father is an immigrant. Came here from Sicily when he was 15 years old This guy's been cutting hair his whole life. Not tech savvy whatsoever, right? Calls me up the other night, he lives in Chicago. I live out here in Los Angeles. Calls me up, he's, like, "Yeah, I want to learn Internets." Now, I don't know if anybody's ever taught anybody the Internet over the phone. It's virtually impossible. You cannot use Internet terms with someone who doesn't know a computer. And I found that out right from the get-go. I said, "Dad, you gotta open up your window." He's, like, "Why? I got two feet of snow outside. Is that for better reception? You get better reception that way, huh?" Reception? You got to dummy it down. You gotta explain exactly what they see. I said, "Dad, there's a blue e. Do you see a blue e with, like, a sphere? Do you see that?" I said, "You gotta click that twice." He's, like, "Why twice?" And I'm, like, "Yeah, why twice?" For years I've been doing two. One, you get nothing, two, it happens. I said, "Dad, I don't know. Just click it twice." He's, like, "Is that what the foot pedal's for?" Foot pedal? He had the mouse on the floor! "It's not a sewing machine! What are you doing?! Put the foot pedal on the desk! What the hell are you looking at, tell me." He's, like, "I think I broke it. I got pipes. I got pipes." How old is your computer that you still have the pipe screen saver? Is it beige? Is it a Presario? What do you got? I said, "Shake the foot pedal to get rid of the pipes." I said, "Dad, come on. On the top, do you see a white bar?" I was gonna say "cursor." He ain't gonna get that. "Is there a stick blinking in whiteness? Do you see this?" He's, like, yeah, "I see it." He types it in, presses return. He's, like, "I got no- I got nothing. You gotta call the Internets and tell them I got no Web site." I said, "Read it back. What is it?" He's, like, "I got it. www d-o-t..." "What? You spelled out 'dot'"? I'm trying to get the guy to e-mail, right? So I finally get him there. I said, "Dad, call me when you send it, right?" He called me back. He's, like, "Yeah, I sent it. I don't know when you're gonna get this, okay? It could be five, six days depending how busy Yahoo is. I don't know." I said, "Dad, I'm looking at it." So I open up the e-mail. The entire e-mail is in the subject heading. I'm, like, "What the...?" It's... it's scary, man, right? And the older I get the worse I get, right? I'm a huge hypochondriac. I constantly think I'm passing away. I constantly think I'm dying. I woke up one morning, my hands were dry. I'm, like, "Oh, come on. What, am I disintegrating? What's happening?" Now with this use of technology, anything medically related, I don't go to the doctor. You know what I do? I go right to Google. You will admit stuff to Google that you won't tell a soul. If Google ever comes out with a printout of what you been asking it, you're gonna have to leave California. I type in, "I got dry hands. What does that mean?" Now a bunch of stuff comes back with Google. Well, now, Google, I stay on page one. I never go to page two. I'm always on page one. I don't even know what's on page two. A horse is involved all the time, I don't know what it is. I'm always on page one, first three topics, right? I'm going to try and self-diagnose what I have based on other people's stories and anecdotes. This is the worst thing you could do to yourself, okay? The first story I read, the guy's like, "I had dry hands three months ago. Now I got no fingers." What?! So that's it, I think I'm dying. I don't eat, I don't sleep. Three and a half weeks, I lost 15 pounds. My friends were coming up to me going, "Sebastian, gee, you look fantastic. What the hell have you been doing?" And in my head, I'm like, "I think I'm dying." So I went to the hospital, right? Go to the hospital, go to the doctor. I walk in, I go, "Take a look. Look at this." He goes, "Ooh, hold on. Let me take a look at something." I go, "Where you going, Google? I was just there. It says I'm going to lose my fingers. What do you know?" He's like, "I'm going to write you a prescription to get some lotion." Now, this is always a problem-- going to your local pharmacy to get medication. I don't know why. You give your slip to the pharmacist, he always looks at it, he's like, "Ooh! It's going to be about another 25 minutes. If you want to walk around Walgreens... about another 25 minutes, okay?" And I'm like, "It's right there. It's right on the shelf." But you never question the pharmacist. You're always like, "Oh, okay." I didn't take the walk. I stood my ground. I go, "You got it, right?" He's like, "Yeah, we got it." I go, "Why I got to walk around?" He's like, "There's people ahead of you." I go, "No, they're not. I'm staring right at you. Where are they?" He's like, "They're walking around Walgreens." What? Nobody could tell me why I'm taking this walk. For years, I swear to God, I thought people were making medication in the back room. I thought there was some guy filling up little caplets, going, "Tell him to walk around! I can't get the damn things on. They're too small. I need another 25 minutes. I got 30 caplets." So I took the walk. I came back. There's a person in front of me, and there's a line-- I didn't see this the first time-- there's a line on the floor with two footprints. And it says on the floor, "For the privacy of the person in front of you, please stand behind the line." Now, the person is right here. I'm right here behind the line. You're telling me this much... I can't hear nothing? Right here... Right here, no idea what's happening. Right here, "He's got gonorrhea! Oh, my God!" Every time you come out of the pharmacy, there's always a... a homeless guy in there. I don't know why this is. I love to give to the homeless-- don't get me wrong-- but I get attacked nine, ten times a day for change. I don't have this type of change for the demand. So I give, but I give once a day, and now I base it on how they approach me. The guy today had an amazing approach, okay? Beautiful posture. Made direct eye contact. Came up, asked me very nicely. He's like, "Hey, you got a couple quarters? I'm down on my luck." I said, "There you go, man. Sorry to hear that." He walked his way. I walked mine. There was no problem. But sometimes they scare the crap out of you, right? They'll fall out of a bush. They got some screwed-up walk. Why am I going to give you anything? You took no time with your presentation. You got 24 hours a day, and this is the best you could come up with? I don't know what's wrong with people. It's all changing, man. But I'm glad you guys came out tonight to watch some live entertainment, because I don't even know what they're giving you on television. Right, American Idol. This is a huge, huge thing. Right, what is it? It's your neighbor. You turn it on, you're like, "Isn't this Kyle from Kinko's? What the hell is he doing on television?" No, I grew up with entertainment, man. Musicians that created something-- an image, a costume. When Michael Jackson first came out, I lost my mind. Oh, God. Yeah, he came on MTV, I stopped what I was doing. It was like an event. I'm like, "Ma, look at this. He's on. He's got one glove." Do you know the talent you have to have to come up with one... glove? Nobody gave him this outfit. The guy had to think of this. Sitting in his house after Off the Wall, he's like, "How am I going to top eight million sold? Go get me one glove." What? "Yeah, and go dip it in diamonds." What? Do you think he stopped with the glove? He's like, "You know what? Go do that with my socks." Then he looked at himself in the mirror. He's like, "They're not going to be able to see the socks. Hem the pants eight inches off the ground." What? And not only did he pull it off, the whole world was doing it. I was doing it. I had the red jacket with the zippers and the cheese graters on the top. I would put Michael Jackson moves into conversations. I'd came up to my mother. I go, "Ma, you think I could get a Popsicle?" (cheering and applause) We were all doing it. That's talent. Prince-- remember when this guy first came out? Huh? Four-foot-two? Four-foot-two with high heels. I didn't even question that. Purple Rain? The movie changed my life. Remember that motorcycle he had? Eight times too big for him. Remember when he pulled up to Lake Minnetonka? He's sitting on his bike with that black jumpsuit, that mane for a hairdo, that shit around the mouth, whatever the hell that was. His little boots. Size two boots. Apollonia-- Apollonia was this guy's girlfriend's name. Could you imagine meeting this couple at a party? Be like, "Hey, how you doing? My name's Prince. This is Apollonia. What's your name?" You're like, "Shit, I got to go change it." What do you come back with? "My name's John, this is Carol. What the hell are you? Are those mini boots? What do you ha...? Is that lace around your wrists? Who are you?" I wanted to be Prince. I'd walk around my house out of nowhere, "Dearly beloved..." "Dearly beloved..." My mother would be like, "What the hell did you just say?" "Mother, I said, 'Dearly beloved...'" Now what do we got? American Idol? Some idiot from Montana singing a song in his T-shirt with his entire family in the front row telling America to vote. "Vote! Vote for our child so we could all have a better life." Fuck your kid. He stinks. Put him in the trunk. Thank you, guys. You've been fantastic. Thank you so much. (cheering and applause) Thank you. (cheers and applause) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (music fades)
