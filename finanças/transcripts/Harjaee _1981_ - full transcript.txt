- Hello! - Rajnath! Yes! - I am calling from Safdar bazaar police station. Police station? Your son Ajay is here! What is Ajay doing at the police station? The traffic police have arrested him for rash driving! Be thankful that nobody was killed, sir! Sir, please explain to him. Otherwise someday something could happen to him too! He is your son. So I am just giving him a warning and leaving him. Had it been somebody else, then he would have been... ...in the lock up at least for one night! Okay! Thank you! It would have been good if he had spent a night or two in the cell! Whom are you talking about? - Your son! - My son! What has he done? Sharda, there was some dearth in your love! Otherwise today Ajay would have been rotting in the prison! What kind of a father are you! What kind of a father I am! You never say what kind of son you have! So what if he failed in the exams? He will pass the next year! He is still a child! If there are complains from the college... ...then children are bound to play mischief! If he indulges in fights then children do fight! Now when he is in the lock up then why are you getting worried? Children do go to prison! [WHISTLING] Come! Come! - In which car race have you participated? - I... I... Tell me! Are any parts of the car still intact... ...or did all of it become a victim of your rash driving! Oh ho. Will you just keep on scolding him? Or will you let him eat something too? Poor guy is hungry and thirsty since morning! Hungry and thirsty my foot! Disgusting! No manners! You have grown up still you don't know... ...how to sit on the dinner table! - What will you do in your life? - Please! Do you know anything besides loitering around? - Yes! - Who was in the car? - I... Who else was in the car with you? - Girls and boys! - Girls! All the time girls! Sharda, from tomorrow he won't go in the car! Fine! He won't go! And from today he won't get any pocket money! - Yes! No pocket money! - Till the time he doesn't act decently! - What happened? - He won't get a penny! - What happened? - What happened, son? - Ajay! - Ajay! - Ajay! What happened? - Ajay! - Water! Water! Shankar, get water! I will call the doctor! - Son! Son, drink water! - Water, mother! Drink water! Hello! Hello! Dr. Gupta! Fine! Fine! This is Rajnath speaking! Tell Dr. Gupta to immediately come home! Ajay is not fine! He is coughing continuously! Okay! There is nothing wrong with you! Absolutely perfect! - Punjabi! - Yes, sir! - Check Ajay's blood pressure. - Right! - We are waiting for you downstairs! - Okay, sir! Move! You know that I am fine! You fool! If I am caught, I will lose my job! I won't get my salary! I have not got my salary for the past 6 months! So what? Give fake certificate to students! And earn money! Keep quiet! It's a trade secret between you and me! You get worried so easily, Raj! Its just normal cough. Nothing else. He won't think anything while scolding him. If something happens to him then that's it! - Why not? He is the only son! Raj! - Yes! Send Ajay to the clinic tomorrow! I will take his test! Sister-in-law, won't you offer me tea? - Go and get tea! - Surely! Surely! Have a seat! Come! Come, Gupta! Have a seat! By the way... is Ajay fine? - Every person should get these tests done! - I see! They just have to spend some money. - But at least their health remains fine. - Yes! Yes! Come on, Ajay! Let's dance! - No! Today Ajay will dance with me! - No! With me! I will dance with everybody! Everybody! Come on! - Here comes, Ajay. - Hi Ajay. Hi. I am in the mood to dance today.

Who will dance with whom! Okay! You first! - Dance with me! - Darling, dance with me! What about me? I have found this evening's partner! - Ajay, please don't go! - Let him go! I am there! You shut up! - Hello! - Hello! May I have the pleasure of a dance please? No! I don't dance with a stranger! - Stranger? You mean you don't know me? - No! Then I will write my name and address on your lips! Damsel, you have yourself given your hand to me! I declare in the jamboree that I will never let go of this hand! I will never leave you! It's not a joke! And you are not worthy enough! Wow! Wow! Sorry! I will dance with the man whom I like. [AHEM] May I have the pleasure of a dance with you please? Thank you! She is in love with me!

Scoundrel! - Let's take him to the hospital! - Yes! Not hospital! Take him to a school! So that he can learn new tricks to entice girls! She is so egoistic! Ajay... you can't entice this girl! Not just this girl, I will even entice her father! No need to worry! This is what happens in the beginning! Dad, but there is a limit to it! All the guys in this college are goons! Since the day I have gone to college... ...everyday ragging, everyday mischief! They have made my life miserable! If not in college then where else will mischief be played? If you got scared of them then their mischief will increase. There is only one way! Face them! Face them! And instead of getting angry, use your brains! - Shyam! - Yes! Yesterday you played that drama because of Ajay! But I know that you are a nice guy! So I want to befriend you! Do you see this? Beauty and the beast! Hey, dark skinned! You are acting so smugly! Do you see their daring! You all are kids! So remain like kids! Got it? Otherwise I will break your bones! Come on! Let's go! Geeta and that foolish Bruce Lee!

I will teach him a lesson! Shyamu! Bruce Lee! You are acting smugly! - Ajay, lay off! - My dear brother-in-law! Why are you angry with your brother-in-law? I am just your sister's lover! Your sister! Just what are you trying to prove? Geeta likes me! She is in love with me! Wrestler, if you fell in love, then you will lose your muscles! - So? - Go to some wrestling ground! Fight and wrestle! - Come! You want to fight! - Shyam! Shyam, what are you doing? Come here, Shyam! Shyam, come here! Go! Wag your tail and go! Your mistress is calling you! Go! Ajay! The principal! Ajay! Come to my office! Okay! So what if he is my friend? He is the college Principal too! How long will he tolerate indiscipline? There is only cure for Ajay! Now he won't go to the college! If he won't go to college, then what will he do? You only used to say! He should at least do BA! I want that to happen! - But your son doesn't care for my hopes! - But... Nothing doing! Now he won't even venture out... ...of this house without my permission! And if he left, then he can never come back! This is my decision! We won't enjoy college's Kashmir trip without you! And that Shyam... he thinks he is Geeta's bodyguard... ...and he is going with her. - What! - Yes! - So we should teach Shyam a lesson! - Yes! So we shouldn't lose this opportunity! In Kashmir we will teach both of them such a lesson... ...that they will always remember it! But who will let me go to Kashmir? Daddy has even prohibited me from going out of the house! House arrest! Look at this! Look at this! Look at this! What are you thinking? - Do you see this? - What is this? The pill for going to Kashmir! What do you mean? I don't understand! I will explain! I will explain! I will explain everything! Every person has one heart! But my daddy has two hearts! One is wrathful! And the other is loving! If somebody tells daddy that I have a dangerous sickness... ...then his second heart will start functioning! Love for me will arouse in his heart! He will awaken! He will feel emotional! And he will do whatever I say! Your plan is nice! But what ailment will you fake? Anything! Anything dangerous! Some dangerous aliment! I have an idea! Paralysis! Fool! Forget Kashmir! You will stop my moving around in the house too! Think of some other ailment! Dangerous! Terrifying ailment! - Terrifying ailment! - TB! It's a very cheap ailment! Coughs! Think of a sophisticated ailment! Impressive! Terrifying! Dangerous! Cancer! ALL: Yes! And Dr. Punjabi will give the good news to daddy! - Yes. - Come on. I can't say such a big lie! No Dr. Punjabi! Why are you scared? I don't really have cancer! - You just have to fake it! - No, no! I have done a lot for you! You wanted holidays! I wrote fake certificates! And now faking such a grave illness! You only used to say... all is fair in love and war! All is fair in love and war! I am doing this for my love! - You are doing this for your love! - For my love? - You love me, don't you? - I do love her! Yes! Forgot? What all things I didn't do for your love? - I remember everything! - You remember it! - I hope you didn't tell anybody! - No! Now it's my turn! - What are you doing? - I am calling Mr. Rajnath! - What are you doing? Don't do it! - You tell him that... ...his son is ailing from cancer. - I am a very good doctor! I can't do it! - Rajnath! - What are you doing? - Rajnath! Dr. Punjabi! Tell me! About Ajay? I will just come! I am afraid of just one thing! If your father got suspicious that I am faking this... ...then my position as a doctor will be ruined! It has taken me 30 years to make my reputation! Uncle, why are you scared? Now see my acting! Go and receive daddy! Go and welcome him! Go! Go! Go! What's the matter, Dr. Punjabi? What happened to Ajay? - Sir... I am very sorry. The thing is that... - What's the matter? God wills this is not true! But Ajay has cancer! What rubbish! What are you saying? How is this possible? Never before... - Where is Ajay? - He is in the opposite room. - Ajay! - Daddy! - Son! - No, daddy! If you got dejected, then how will I live? - No, son! Don't say that! - Daddy! You wanted me to stay at home! Now I will never venture out of the house! Never! - Now only my corpse will leave the house! - No, no! Don't say that! Don't say that! Daddy! Daddy! Promise me! Promise me that you will never tell mummy! Son... no, son! Nothing will happen to you! Nothing will happen to you! I will consult doctors all over the world! Nothing can happen to my son! Nothing can happen to my son! - Mama! Mama! - Ajay! - Mama! Mama! - Let go! - Ajay... good that you returned home soon! - Why? I was afraid that if your daddy came before you then... ...today I wouldn't have been able to save you from his wrath! He would have scolded you so much... Yes! Yes! I have the ailment of scolding! Only you love him! I am not his father! I am his enemy! Then what? You always scold my son like an enemy! Mom is right, dad! Mom is right! Son, but what's my fault? It's my family profession to scold! - Family profession? - Yes! My great grandpa used to scold my grandpa a lot! And when my grandpa became a father, he decided! That he will vent out the revenge... ...of all the scolding on my daddy! So my daddy received my grandpa's... ...scolding till he breathed his last. Then came my turn! So my daddy showed his wealth of scolding on me! And now its democracy time! How can I keep so much wealth with me? So I am showering it on my son! Carry on, dad! Carry on! I too promise you! Raghu clan's custom has always been followed! I might die but I won't break my promise! I too will shower your wealth on my son! [LAUGHING] That's the spirit! Listen! This has never happened before! Father was laughing with son! It has made me suspicious! Is it... that you both are hiding something from me? - No, Sharda! This is not so! This is not so, Sharda! - Oh! Thank God! Today... today there is so much of happiness in this house! - Listen! - Yes! - Look at me! - I am reading! - I won't let you read! - What are you doing? I too am lying on the bed! - I know! - What do you know? You turn your back and lie down as soon as you come to sleep. So what shall I do? What you used to do before! We are not so old that you can't even talk to me! Sharda! Tell me what's the matter? Since evening I am feeling anxious! - Anxious! - Yes! - Don't you find this house forlorn? - So? Don't you feel that there should be happiness... ...liveliness and a small child in this house? Are you mad? Why? Don't people have children? At this age? People will laugh! - If not yours then think about Ajay! - Oh! [LAUGHING] You... you thought I was talking about you? An old tree gives only shade, not fruits! I was thinking about Ajay's marriage! Today seeing you both laughing... ...I remembered Ajay's childhood! When he was small... he would laugh with you so much! When he will have a son, he too will laugh like that! Am I right? What? Don't you want to become a grandpa! Search a girl for him! - No, Sharda! Don't talk about this! - Why? He has to still finish his studies! He has to handle his responsibility! Responsibility! Responsibility! When he will get married, he will handle it on his own! If you can't do it, then I will find an alliance! Hello! Dr. Punjabi! Rajnath here! Do you know when is Dr. Gupta going to return from America? Okay! How are you, son? Did you sleep well? Now I am going to sleep peacefully! Don't say that, son! You will get well! I will consult the most famous doctor! I will... No, dad! No! It's futile! There is no cure of this ailment! But, daddy! I don't want to choke and die in this house! I want to live my remaining days joyfully! I want to fulfil all my desires and wishes in these few days, daddy! After that I might die! I don't mind! Your mother is coming! Failing in the exams doesn't mean that you stop going to the college! You won't stay in the house anymore! Daddy, can I go to college? What do you mean? You will have to go! Till the time you don't pass BA! Got it? Mummy! Mummy, did you hear? Along with going to the college... ...daddy has also given me the permission to go to Kashmir! - Really! - Kashmir! You saw the effect. Oh no. - Will you do me a favour? - Tell me! Will you repair the punctured tyre? On one condition! Your bus's tyre has got punctured... ...and my heart has got punctured! You repair my heart! I will do your work! So shall we go to repair the puncture? Not even my shoes will go with you! "Listen, beautiful damsel." "You are a precious gem." "There is nobody like you." "So what happened?" "Listen, beautiful damsel." "You are a precious gem." "There is nobody like you." "So what happened?" "I too am the King of heart." "Come in my arms."

"Leave my hand." "You are crazy about them." "You are a vagabond." [CLAPPING] - Siddhu, look... - [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] Who is Mr. Ajay? - Me. - A message for you. Probably it is some girl's. Father has reached before us. Its good. I will get some money. - You guys go ahead. - Bye. Its a good thing. Father! Good morning, father. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hello, son. How are you? Top of the world, dad, top of the world. - Ajay, when did you come. - Mother. Mother, you have come too? Did you hear? Why? Why can't she come? She is my wife. She has come with me. No, no, I mean because mother didn't have a program of coming here. You crazy guy, its very difficult to live without a wife. You will realize it when you reach my age. Father, I have a lot of time before reaching your age. Yes, of course, I know. Come. Sit here. My worry about you has brought me here, you crazy. Is it? Why? Am I sick? Father, has anything happened to me? Nothing has happened to you. What will happen to you while I am here? - I am there! - That's great! Wow! I will take all your sorrows! - Mother, I have only one sorrow! - What? My pocket is morose! You won't give up this old habit! Tell me. How much do you want? Mother, give me as much as you want for my meals! - Wait! I will just get it! - Hurry up! Hurry up! "Every miracle in this world has been created by You." "What mosque and what temple?" "The religion of the heart is to love." "Meeratsam! Meeratsam! Meeratsam!" Hey, boatman! What does this song means? There is only one meaning of all our songs, ma'am! Love!

Love everybody! You and here? I am where you are! Love once and see... [GIRLS' LAUGHING] He took the guise of a boatman! Yes! For a second I too got fooled! - Were you alone? - Yes! Then Ajay must have made you his victim! What will he do? I pushed him in the water! Now he won't flirt anymore! You hate a guy like Ajay? It's not that! The thing is that I don't like his behaviour! His mischief... showing off in front of everybody! - It's okay if he does it when he is alone! - Get lost! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome, darling! Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! Springs, shower flowers! My beloved has come! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Clouds, make a noise! The ape too has come! What did you say? What did you say? - You called me an ape! - Not ape! I said sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Shyam, my bouquet! - Come on! Return her bouquet! - Shut up! I don't want to dishonour my love by returning my beloved's gift! But she loves me! And she has brought the bouquet for me! Because I am going to win in today motor boat race! The decision has been taken! Today motor race winner will get this bouquet! - Am I right, Geeta! - Yeah!

Why are you troubling your delicate feet? Come! Sit in the car! Look, Ajay! You saved Shyam's life! Thanks! But it's futile to follow me! It's not futile! Believe me! I love you! I hated you! I hate you! And I will always... Don't say anything more! I am sure! If not today then tomorrow... ...you too will fall in love with me for sure! All the best! In our jest the matter has become serious! But you won't be able to entice Geeta! Shut up! I didn't plan Kashmir's trip just like that! Such a holiday... Daddy has come! Run! Run! Everyone! You sit here! Ravi... the way I can't stop my breath. Similarly I can't stop loving her. Before being hanged every wish of the dead is fulfilled. In my last days... can't I even see Geeta's one smile? If she is in front of me... then my final days will be so lovely. [COUGHING] - Daddy, you? - What is going on? - Good morning, uncle! - Good morning! - Daddy, today is our pony race! - I see! So we were talking about that! Okay! I came just like that! - You have still not taken a bath! - I was just about to! Have a seat! Come, uncle! Sit! - Who is this Geeta? - Geeta! I don't know! I heard Ajay's conversation! Ajay loves Geeta? Yes, uncle! She... she lives here? She lives in the lake bungalow! Okay! Excuse me! Is there a girl named Geeta here? She is there! Thank you! - Geeta! - Yes! My name is Rajnath! My son studies with you in college! Ajay! Yes! But he... I want to talk to you urgently. It's important. Come with me. I have come to ask Ajay's happiness from you. - What? - That too just for a few days! - I don't understand! Dear... if a person is rich then he can buy anything in the world. But no wealth can give life to the dead. Ajay... Ajay is my only son! - And he... will die soon. - What are you saying? Yes! Yes, dear. Ajay has... cancer! What! No, no! This can't be true! I am sure you have been mistaken! How can Ajay have cancer? He always... Laughs! Plays mischief! Am I right, dear? - He is like that! Otherwise death... - Does he know? Yes! He knows! But he... doesn't want to wait for death lying on the hospital bed! Dear... I heard him talking about you to his friend. I don't know whether he has told you or not. But I feel... he... he loves you. He knows that this love is useless. It's just his desire. Its his last wish that maybe you... Dear... dear... ...he... he just wants friendship from you. He wants to share some joyful moments with you! If for a dying man you... Dear... Please! Dear... please! I... I will try! I will surely try! Thank you! Ajay! Geeta! You guys stay here! I will go! Ajay, listen! Ajay! Ajay, please stop! Ajay! [GROANING] Geeta! Geeta! Are you hurt? Where were you running away? - Didn't you receive my message? - Message? - Did you... did you really tell me to stop? - Yes! But why? I didn't follow you. Now I know that the game is over. I am thinking... of returning home! If I stayed here... I will see you and I will miss you! Geeta! Geeta, this is a lifelong ailment! This ailment will be with me till my death! No, Ajay! I am sorry for the way I behaved with you. I was just pretending to hate you. If possible... then remove this fake hatred from your heart. It will give me peace. Ajay... won't you ever forgive me? What's the use? If I forgave you... Will you start loving me? No! Geeta... I am not destined for love! No, Ajay! Ajay... what if people would never die? - There would have been a problem! - Why? People would have become God! And then in this world of many Gods... ...who would have cared for Geeta and Ajay? Geeta, nature has created everything mortal. It gets destroyed! It's created again! Again it's destroyed! The way a person dies! He is again born! Again he dies! Are you not afraid of death? Fear? What fear? Death is a long slumber! Just think! When a sleep of 7-8 hours is so nice! Then how lovely will death be! I am eagerly waiting for death! Ajay! Ajay, keep me with you forever. I can't live without you. I too cannot live without you. Papa! Papa! I love you. Very good! - Do you know? What does that mean? - No! - It means I love you! I need you! - Really? Yes! I love you! I need you! "When such moments will arrive in life." "We won't be able to live without each other." "I will again tell you lovingly." - "What? - I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" "When such moments will arrive in life." "We won't be able to live without each other." "I will again tell you lovingly." - "What? - I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" "We will surely unite." "Whether people want it or not." "How will we not find the destination?" "We will surely find the path of our heart." "I will again tell you lovingly." "I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" "Till yesterday you were a vagabond." "From today you are just mine." "Now I will not let you go anywhere." "I will again tell you lovingly." "I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" "I will steal you from yourself." "And I will take you far away from the world." "This is what my heart has asked for." "That I receive your love in all my lifetimes." "I will tell you lovingly in all the lifetimes." "I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" "When such moments will arrive in life." "We won't be able to live without each other." "I will again tell you lovingly." "I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" "I love you! I need you!" - The last wish of my life too has come true! - What? Before dying... I wanted to see you close to me and smiling. Don't say that, Ajay! What all things I didn't do to get your friendship! Just for friendship? Don't you love me? I wanted to befriend you because of love! Just friendship? Won't you marry me? Answer me, Ajay! Tell me! No, Geeta! I can't marry you! Don't ask me why I can't marry you! - You are under my oath, Ajay! - No, Geeta! Don't do that! I can't marry you! Why? Why? Why? Because... because I have cancer! No, Geeta! I am not so selfish that I will marry you and ruin your life! Ajay... you are so honest! You are so... The way you are living, nobody can live like that! Style of living is called life, Geeta! Some people spend their lives! But I want to live life! For me my each moment, my each breath is precious! And I want to amass maximum joy in minimum time! Congratulations! Ajay! Plan successful! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Ajay! - Good morning, dad! How are you? - Hello! Mama, she is Geeta! - Greetings! - God bless you! - Hello. - Geeta studies in my college! - Hello! - Have a seat! How are you? [COUGHING] - Have a seat! - Do you live in Delhi? Yes! Rajpat nagar! My friend too lives in Rajpat nagar! 4C! - That's our house! - Are you Shobraj's daughter? - Yes! - Very good! It has been a long time since I met that fool... I am sorry! He is your father! Geeta... you are the first girl whom Ajay has introduced to us! Why are sitting there and smiling? Go and order tea! Not here! Ring the bell! He is so lazy! Geeta, tell me the truth! Do you like Ajay? What? He is nice! He is very sweet! You too are really nice! Do you like Ajay? You sit! I will just come! This... She doesn't know anything! I didn't have the guts to tell her. We have only one son! What are you complaining about my son? Geeta, don't listen to him! He finds only flaws in my son! Is there anybody like my son in this world? - So jolly, so innocent! - This... So handsome! Dear, you have met me for the first time. Will I let my daughter-in-law return empty-handed? 'Geeta... you are the first girl whom Ajay has introduced to us!' 'Dear, you have met me for the first time.' 'Will I let my daughter-in-law return empty-handed?' 'Okay, Geeta, truly tell me how is Ajay?' 'You are also very good.'

It's a sin! Geeta, last night whatever happened... ...its neither your nor my fault. We both were helpless. If you still think that we have committed a sin... ...then come... let's atone for it. - Atone? - Yes! Let's get married! Married? I know what you are thinking! What's the use of marrying the man who is going to die soon? No, Geeta! I will live... for you! For myself! For our happiness! Ajay, I don't understand! The day you will understand it, you will go mad with joy! Your Ajay is fine! I am healthy! I don't have cancer! What! Yes, Geeta! I lied so that I could have you! - You lied to me that you have cancer! - No, Geeta! You played such a big ruse! No, Geeta! This is not a ruse! This is love! Don't take the name of love! I know you very well! Faking cancer to create sympathy... ...you have played with my heart, my emotions and my body! No, Geeta! Try to understand me! Geeta is dead! I have no relationship with you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Geeta! Geeta! Geeta, come in, dear. Sharda, look who has come? Geeta has come. - Come and sit. - I have not come to sit I have come to ask. If I had to be your own daughter, would you have deceived me like this? Don't try to feign ignorance! Ajay told me everything! For your son's lust a renowned man like you... ...can stoop so low, I could have never imagined! - Geeta! Didn't you even think that I too am somebody's daughter? What have I done? What else is left to do? Didn't you say that your son has cancer? He is dying! To give him some sympathy! What happened, Geeta? What's the matter? You all are liars! Liars! Liars! Listen, what did she say? Who has cancer? Why did she call you a liar? Tell me something! Operator! Give me lightening call to Delhi. 464431! Hello, Dr. Punjabi here! Dr. Punjabi, Rajnath here! Was Ajay's cancer report true or false? - I... I... - Answer me in yes or no! - I... I mean... - Punjabi! Damn fool! Does Ajay have cancer or not? No! Ajay doesn't have cancer! Thank God! Doctor said that Ajay has cancer. And you didn't even tell me. Such a serious matter... You didn't tell me! - Hand over that doctor to the police! - No, no! It's futile to blame the doctor, Sharda! Its all Ajay's doing! This is how he plays with our love! And all this happened because of you! You are responsible for this doing! God! What kind of joke is this! Good morning, dad! Good morning, mom! - What happened to mummy? - Sharda! Yes! It's all my fault! Had I heeded you then today I wouldn't have had to see this day! It would have been better if you hadn't been born! You are not my son! You are an enemy! Tell him to leave! To leave! Not to even show his face! - I don't want to see his face! - Keep quiet! - I don't want to! - Will you kill yourself for him? [SHARDA SOBBING] Mother! Mother! Forgive me, mother! Forgive me! Why should I forgive you? Tell me! Why? Why? Why? Why should I forgive you? This is how you have repaid my love? This is how you have rewarded us for your upbringing! God knows what all things that girl told him! And he... he just stood and listened! Why? Because of you! Because of you he was ashamed! O God! What kind of son are you! What kind of son are you! - Mother! - Leave me! Before saying such a big lie... You didn't even think... ...that your father loves you so much! If in your sorrow something had happened to him... ...then what would I have done? Tell me! What would I have done? No, mother! Forgive me! Forgive you? If you want forgiveness then ask it from him! Daddy! Daddy, forgive me! Forgive me! Son, good that you lied to your father. I had a strong heart. I endured it. If you had joked with your mother... ...then you would have seen the outcome. Forgive me, daddy! Forgive me! I will never lie again, daddy! Never! Geeta. Geeta, I would like to speak to you. Can't we forget the past? I have forgotten everything. I don't have any relation with you any more. Geeta. - Geeta is there! - Where? Come! - Geeta, what happened? - Nothing! Nothing! Since the time you have returned from Kashmir... ...you have stopped laughing. What's the matter? Tell me, Geeta! Did you have a fight with Ajay? I truly loved him. I truly loved him. But he... he turned out to be a heartless man! [SOBBING] Hi, Ajay! What's the matter, Ajay? What happened? Nothing! My joke ruined the matter! Geeta is not ready to hear anything! Why do you worry? Tonight she is coming for Suresh's party! You can talk to her there. [MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS PLAYING] After that when he went to Pune, he didn't return! What are you talking? Ajay! Geeta! - Geeta! - Don't touch me! Geeta, I want to tell you everything! I don't care for you or your talks! But I do care for you! Geeta... I really love you! What your love is... what you are... I know it very well! Geeta, give me a chance to justify myself! Coal doesn't become clean by washing it, Mr. Ajaynath! What you are... you will always remain that! - Geeta! - Don't shout!

Ajay's dizziness spell... fainting. It's not because of his mental or physical system being upset. Then? I went to America last month for this. For what? For the past one year I was suspicious. You know... I have done Ajay's blood, stool tests and x-ray. I was waiting for this attack. In America I confirmed this... That Ajay... has cancer. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] The joke... has come true! No, sir! Forgive me! My lie has come true! My lie has come true! Forgive me! Forgive me! Where is sister-in-law? No! No! No! [CRYING] Sharda! Come to your senses! Come to your senses! Sharda! Come to your senses! Do you want to kill your son? I... save my son! Save my son! Yes, Sharda! We both will try to do this! Come! Come! But... but you are leaving my son! No! Gupta, I want to take my son home! I don't want my son to know... That he has cancer! - I understand! - Thank you! Come! Let's wait outside! Come! Come! Come! [BIRDS' CHIRPING] Ajay! Get up! Shall I serve you tea? - Where is mummy? - She is in the kitchen! She is preparing breakfast for sir! Why don't you prepare breakfast? - Tell mummy to come up! - She won't come! Why? Why won't she come? Tell mummy that Ajay is calling her! He is not drinking his tea! Ma'am, Ajay sir is calling you! Sharda, go! Go! You... how long will you not go in front of him? Sharda, we will have to hide our pain! We have to be patient! No! Don't tell me to go in front of him! I... I won't be able to endure it! - God... why don't You take my life? - Mother! He will come down, Sharda. And that's not good for his health. - Please come up, Mother. - Go on, Sharda. - I... I. - Go. Go. Yes. Go. Listen, be careful. Okay. Go. - Mother! - What happened? - Come here! - Why are you yelling? Everybody commands me! If your father is not given breakfast on time... ...then he creates commotion! If I don't serve you tea for a day then won't you drink tea? - Come here! Come here! - Leave me! - What are you doing? - Mother, listen to me! I don't have time for useless talks! Not even for me? Mother... you don't even have time for your son? Son! Mother, last night too you loved me like this! - Last night? - In my dream! It was a strange dream! I was small... in your lap. You come to love me. And I start crying. I don't stop crying. You flung me up to stop my crying. - And I go up, up... in the sky, mother. - No! Sharda! What happened? No! No! I... I can't take it anymore! - Sharda, keep quiet! Keep quiet! - Why? Why did you send me to him? Why? Why? Why? - Sharda, don't lose hope! Everything will be fine! How? Why do you give me false hope? Is there any cure of cancer? [SOBBING] Sharda, for God's sake... For God's sake, keep quiet! I am enduring this grave sorrow. - And you are telling me to keep quiet! - Sharda! How can any mother be quite? Sharda, keep quiet! Keep quiet! [SOBBING] No! 'If I have to die, then why not today?' 'Till the time I am alive, my family will remain sad.' 'No! I should die! I should die!' [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] 'Death is a long slumber!' 'Just think! When a sleep of 7-8 hours is so nice!' 'Then how lovely will death be!' 'Style of living is called life, Geeta!' 'Some people spend their lives! But I want to live life!' 'For me my each moment, my each breath is precious!' 'And I want to amass maximum joy in minimum time!' 'Daddy, I don't want to choke and die in this house!' 'I want to live my remaining days joyfully!' 'I want to fulfil all my desires and wishes in these few days!' 'After that I might die! I don't mind!' 'I will live! I will live!' What is this, son? Slowly! Slowly! Slowly! Slowly! Slowly! Why slowly? Am I sick? - I am fine and fit! Am I right, daddy? - Of course! Of course! Son, are you going out? Mother, I was getting bored at home! Dad, shall I go to the club? Surely! But don't be late! Your mother gets worried. Mother, it's futile to worry. What God wills, that happens! What's the matter? Is there no college today too? No, papa! I don't feel like going to college! Did you have a fight with Ajay? Dear... when you love a person a lot... ...then in the beginning you fight a lot. But how can a person fight with a jolly man like Ajay? Daddy, you don't know him. He is a liar! Oh! But dear, at times a man has to lie to keep his girlfriend happy. You too are taking his side, papa? Why not? That poor guy too must be sad! Why will he be sad? He has so many friends. That's why I say to go and clear your misunderstanding. You shouldn't let your man remain free for long. I have not tied him, daddy. [CHUCKLES] When you will get tied to him, will you get upset like this? In a day or two I will go and... - ...talk to his father about the alliance! - Daddy! Now you have become sensible! You should solve your own problems. - You will get married soon. - Papa! You will go to your in-law's house. There too will you get angry for trivial matters? Go, dear. Go to college. When you will meet Ajay... You both will... ...automatically make peace. Papa! Then what happened? The next tale is very interesting! First hear Darjeeling's tale! Geeta is coming! Listen, today mollify her. We will leave now. Hi, Ajay! You are still angry? You get angry at your kin. Not strangers. Who is a stranger here? So what if my beloved is upset? I too know how to mollify him. You hated me! You didn't even want to see my face! That was then! But now I love you! I can't live without you! But I can live without you! Liar! It's your old habit to lie! And I love each of your traits! Go away, Geeta! Now we both share no bond! What do you get by harassing me like this? I love you, Ajay! I love you! It's futile to love the flowing water and fragrant breeze, Geeta! I don't love you! And I never loved you! No! I love girls for my own selfish reason! Even if I have to take fake oaths or play the charade of cancer! When I get what I want, I end the friendship. It was the past! Its over! You are happy like this. I am happy like this. No, Ajay! That's a lie! Say that this is a lie! This is not a lie! It's true! I am like the free breeze! I don't like to remain tied down! I flirt with every girl and then I go my way! Yesterday it was you. Today it's somebody else. Tomorrow it will be somebody else. Geeta, go away! I say go away! Go away! No, no, no! Don't tell me that! At such a young age! What has God done! We all are helpless in front of His will! What can be more bad luck than this? That I am waiting for my son's death. This marriage is not possible! No! My daughter won't marry the man who is going to die so soon! Your daughter has considered him as her husband, daddy! What do you mean? Do you know what will be the outcome? Each person's outcome is the same! Death! But dear, we all are alive! And we try to live! Daddy... without Ajay living for 100 years will be like spending time! If I live even 100 days with Ajay... ...I will feel as if I have lived my entire life span! When I truly fell in love at the time when he faked his illness... ...then now he is really sick, daddy! No! A dying man is not called sick! - Why do you want to become a widow? - Daddy! Dear, this marriage won't take place! This marriage won't take place! This marriage will surely take place! I love Ajay, aunt. I too have some right on him. No, dear! No! Already I don't know for which birth's sin we are paying for! And you... you want us to commit more sins? I want to earn good deeds. No matter for how many days I can keep Ajay happy... ...and be with him... And amass his love. This will be my only treasure! No, dear. This is not possible! Why? Don't you want Ajay to live his life fully? You have fulfilled your duty. You brought him in this world, you raised him. You provided him with education. Now his marriage, his family life! This is as much of a duty for me as it is for you! Why are you stopping me from fulfilling my duty? Don't think, daddy! Ajay doesn't have time! Accept me as your daughter-in-law! Bless me! Daddy! What are you doing? For your son's happiness, you want to ruin an innocent girl's life! You... you... know everything? Yes, daddy. I know everything. And I also know... that I won't live for long. Dad, in spite of knowing all this... No, Ajay! This is my desire. I want this. No, Geeta! I... for my selfishness I can't ruin your joy! And... and this marriage will be my suicide! This marriage is not possible! This marriage will take place! - And you will have to do it! - Geeta! This is the only way for me to escape humiliation. Yes, Ajay! I am pregnant! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Tomorrow night I will either get married or I will die. Why did you do this madness? Why? Love is madness. Listen! Now we are husband and wife! Come! Let's fill this bond with love! No, Geeta! No! This bond is very delicate. It will break. No! I won't let it break! My breath will hold it strong! No, Geeta! No! "I will give you the shelter of my eyelids." "I will tie flowers on my tresses." "When you will feel the heat, I will become the shade." "Come, beloved." "I will give you the shelter of my eyelids." "I will tie flowers on my tresses." "When you will feel the heat, I will become the shade." "Come, beloved." "I will give you the shelter of my eyelids." "The twilight is fragrant." "Everything is intoxicating." "My heart is swaying in coyness." "How do I say it?" "Come, beloved." "The twilight is fragrant." "Everything is intoxicating." "My heart is swaying in coyness." "How do I say it?" "Come, beloved." "I will give you the shelter of my eyelids." "It's a new world." "You are my sole family." "I will live the way you keep me happily." "Come, beloved." "It's a new world." "You are my sole family." "I will live the way you keep me happily." "Come, beloved." "Hey... I will give you the shelter of my eyelids." "My love is your victory." "My love is the best thing." "Beloved, I will cry for you. I will smile for you." "Come, beloved." "My love is your victory." "My love is the best thing." "Beloved, I will cry for you. I will smile for you." "Come, beloved." "Hey... I will give you the shelter of my eyelids." "I will tie flowers on my tresses." "When you will feel the heat, I will become the shade." "Come, beloved." "Hey I will give you the shelter of my eyelids." Fine! This is best for them! They should live happily like this. Gupta, I don't believe it! A girl can give such a big sacrifice. I don't believe this! A person smiles ignorantly in the face of death! [CHUCKLES] I feel like laughing at my helplessness! What is the use of my wealth? What is the use of your doctor's degree? [LAUGHING] Why are you laughing? What happened? Tell me! Tell me whose photo is this! Who else besides you can be shameless... ...enough to click this snap! You are wrong! This is not the shameless one! This is the shameless one's father! Your father-in-law! - Really? - Yes! Geeta! What are you doing? - Who took this photo from my room? - I... I... I am sure it's your mischief! Shameless! - Me? - Shameless! Why are you going on eating? Let daughter-in-law eat it! Mummy, I am helping her! She can't eat so much! - Again! - Slowly! Slowly! What's the hurry? Daddy, you know that I am in a hurry! What happened to her? You won't understand that! - Mummy! - Yes! When will Geeta have to go to the hospital? When doctor will give the date. When will doctor give the date? - When the time will come! - When will it be? I... you joke with me! Naughty one! Daddy, explain to mummy! It's all about time! Hello, darling! - Ups a daisy! - Where are you taking me? I will fall! What are you doing? O God! Please! We will fall down! O my God! Where... where are you taking me? Tell me! Come on! Come on! We will fall! Ouch! Where are you taking me? Tell me! Sit in the car quietly! Come on! Where are we going? Tell me! Carefully! Why are you looking at the watch? [OUCH] Ajay, please watch out. - Exactly 7 minutes! - What do you mean? Means... At the time of your delivery... ...we will reach the hospital from home... ...exactly in 7 minutes. If you will drive like this then the child... ...will be born in the car and not in the hospital. [LAUGHING] - What about this? - No! - Then this! - No! - Then this! - No! You don't like anyone! What kind of a child do you want? - Shall I tell you? - Yes! Just like you! Same eyes, same mischievous lips. And the same loving heart. Really! Darling, I love you! I love you! I love you! Come dear, let me take you for horse riding. Come on my horse! Hey... You pull the reigns! Fool! This is your father's mouth! Not a horse's! [COUGHING] With a lot of difficulty I have become a father, ask your mother. You have started crying? Be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet. - I say quiet! I will slap you! - Why are you scolding? Why shouldn't I scold? Scolding is our family trait. And in this trait I am one step ahead of my father. - What do you say, dad? - What is happening, son? That... what are you staring for? Go and get tea. Go! And grandfather, grandmother and the grandson will drink tea together. [LAUGHING] I don't want to die without seeing my child! Ajay! Nothing will happen to you, Ajay! You will live! Your son will play in your lap! Yes, Ajay! He will address you as papa! - Ajay... I will take your death! - Geeta! I don't want to live like a widow, Ajay! I will die as a married lady! I will die as a married lady, Ajay! Rajnath! No, Rajnath! No! Now I can't endure this, Gupta! I can't tolerate it! My son is dying in front of me! And I... I can't do anything, Gupta! I am so helpless! I am so helpless! I... can't do anything! Rajnath! Rajnath! [SOBBING] Geeta, when a person reads about love... ...then many pictures are formed in his heart. And when he sees somebody loving... ...then he too feels love in his heart. And when he himself falls in love... ...then all the pictures merge together and form one picture. In it he sees his entire world. And he can't see anything else besides that! Geeta... Geeta... I don't have any identity. I am lost in you. Ajay! Why do you love me so much? I don't know! I myself don't know! My heart just says that you should become my body. - And I should become your shadow! - No, Ajay! No! It will become difficult for me to live! How can I live without you? You will be with me! Yes, Geeta! You will always be with me! Till my last breath! We will never die! Love never dies! And... and our lives have just started! Geeta... life too is a co-incidence. Such a co-incidence... which doesn't end even at death. Even if death comes... I will get rid of it! I will say... I am busy loving. Go away! "At times there are tears in the eyes." "At times there are grievances on the lips." "But life, I still love you." "At times there are tears in the eyes." "At times there are grievances on the lips." "But life, I still love you."

"At times there are grievances on the lips." "But life, I still love you." [WIND GUSTING] "I see an unknown face in the ambience." "Whose footsteps do I hear on my silent path?" "Death, don't come now." "My heaven lies here." "At times there are tears in the eyes." "At times there are grievances on the lips." "But life, I still love you." Hi, honey! [SIGHS] O my God! Mother! Mother! What happened? You keep quiet! I will call mother. We have to go to the hospital. Why? Are you... Not me! Now anytime you might want... To hear my son's voice! Don't you know? Which month is this? Now you will have to stay in the hospital. No! I will stay at home! I won't allow you to stay here. Look, am I carrying the child or you? How many months have passed since we got married? Only 7 months! But did you forget... 2 months prior the wedding? Honey, nothing happened then! It happened after marriage. What! You... so you lied to me? My dear husband... If you can say such a big lie to get me... ...then can't I say a small lie to get you? No, Geeta! No! Why did you do this? Why did you do this? - Ajay! - No, Geeta! I have died so many times because of your lie! In the past 7 months I have fought death so many times! I defeated death all the time! Just... just in the hope... That I am going to see my child! But now... now 2 more months! No, Geeta! No! No, Geeta! No! [GROANING] Listen! Listen! You both harass me so much! Since morning neither you have eaten anything nor your son! Look! How it is kicking me! Look! Look! Look! Quickly! Quickly! Quickly! - He... he... he is dancing! - Just like his father! Why not? After all whose son is he! Very good, son! Very good! Very good! Let's have a dance competition... ...between father and son! Very good, son! Very good! What are you doing? Keep it up, boy! Keep it up! [MUSIC] [TENSE MUSIC] Ajay! What happened to you? Ajay, what happened? Ajay, what happened? - Nothing! - What is happening to you, Ajay? ...Nothing will happen to me, Geeta! Nothing will happen to me! Nothing will happen! - I will live! - Ajay! I will live, Geeta! I will live! I will live! I will live for my son, Geeta! I will live for my son! Now how do you feel? Have mummy and daddy returned from temple? No! They will be here soon! Ajay! [CUP CLATTERS] Send mummy and daddy to the hospital quickly! Geeta!
