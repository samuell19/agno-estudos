Finally, finally someone speaks English! I don't know, but for some reason, these maniacs captured me. My name is William McKnight. I'm an American tourist. Why did you parachute down to our village? I didn't. I was parasailing. The cable accidentally broke. What part of Turkey am I in now? You're not in Turkey. You are in Armenia. Armenia? Where the hell is Armenia? You mean like Glendale? Why did they tie me up? They think you are a Turkish spy. Me, a spy? Those are the guys who look like the Turks! Especially him. I don't like that old man. You tell him he's an asshole. And when I get back toAmerica, I'm gonna sue him. Will you please save me? I'm sorry. I don't... I don't wanna be with al-Qaeda. Tell him I'm not a spy! I told him, but he doesn't believe me. Well, we've been retained by Bill McKnight's family to see if we can't expedite the search for him. So we're here at the embassy, see if we can get somecooperation from the Turks and the Turkish government in the search for Bill. I am her Hakhan Takhim, reporting from Yalla TV. Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Yes, slippers Oh, yes. Shit. Hello. Where is the key? Yes! All right. Come on. No! Dumb. Why am I such an idiot. It's you, I live with you. So stupid! He said, come to Turkey. Ugh! Ow! Psst. Psst. Hey, hey, psst you! Hey. Are you alone? Yeah, what are you doing here? Shh! Keep it down. Is anybody here with you? No, but the entirevillage is looking for you. Oh, my god. You gotta help me get outta here. I swear I'm not a terrorist, or a spy, or whatever the hell they think I am. I know, I know. They showed you on Turkish TV. They did? Yes, and everyone knows who you are. So you saying they'rejust gonna let me go? Yes. Are you sure about this? Yes. Yes, I am sure, Bill. You know, I never even got your name. It's Ani. Nice to meet you, Itsani. No. No. No, it's not Itsani. Just Ani. Oh. It's a beautiful name. Thank you. What does your name mean? We used to have a city named "Ani." And it was also known as the city of 1,001 churches. Whoa. That's intense. What does your name mean, Bill? My dad says it was the first thing he thought of after he got thehospital bill when I was born. Oh. Makes sense. Would you like try an Armenian apricot? Well, don't you think you should wash it first? Don't be a baby. Just eat it. If we wanted to kill you, we would have killed you a long time ago. Is it organic? What is "organic"? You know, grown without, like, any pesticides or fillers. You know, basically somethingyou could buy at Whole Foods. Well, yeah, no. I mean, it is... It grows on the tree. Oh. I mean, I guess that will suffice. Wow. Wow. That is, like, the sweetestthing I've ever eaten. That is how Armenian apricots are. Sweet. Yes, sweet. Your mother doesn't want me here. I can leave. Where can you go? I don't know. I'll find somewhere to crash. A henhouse. Oh, boy. Why are you laughing? What's so funny? My life, the situation, what happened to me. I mean, no one would believe this. The whole thing is like a movie. It's crazy. It's... What kind of movie? Uh, it's a tragedy. But you're laughing. Yeah, well, it's a tragic comedy. So what is the title of your movie? Bill's Awfully Amazing Adventure. Oh, yeah. It's a very typical American title. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Oh, you don't like it? No. You got something better? Yes. OK, what is it? How about, um, "BigStar in a Small Village"? Oh. OK, that's, um, a little too Armenian. Oh, OK. How about "Lost." That's so dumb. Why? Because it is an American TV show. - Yeah, you're right. - Yes. It was good, though. Yes. You know, the 5th season is very confusing. Yeah, people say that. How about "Lost and Found." Why would it be called "Lost and Found"? Because this is astory about a guy who's lost, and during an adventure, hefinds what he's looking for. And you have foundwhat you are looking for? Not yet. So then why would it be titled "Lost and Found"? Because the story isn't finished. What the hell is his problem? What does he want from me? What is wrong with that guy? God, he's nothing. He's... - He's a psycho. - No, no, no. No, he's insane! No, no. He's such a sweet old man. He's harmless. Harmless my ass! Guy's a sadist. Jesus. Listen. I just... can I just stay here tonight? I mean, right here. I promise I won't bother you. I'll be gone before your mother gets up. OK. OK? OK. But we have to wake up early, because I would like to visit my father's grave site, OK? OK. OK. You mind if I tag along? Tag along? I mean, you mind if I come with you? Oh. No. OK. OK. Ani? Thanks. You're welcome. It was 1991. I was eight when my father diedduring the war with the Azeris. Him and my cousin Ashad. Ashad was 15. 28 people. 28 people died protecting our village. Grandpa Matsak lost both his sons in one day. - And two days later, - Alexan's brother was killed. Now I know why thepeople here are so enraged. We are not enraged. All our lives, we havefought with Muslim countries for our land. And we have paid for it with our blood, and no one can take it away from us. The Azeris are just on theother side of the mountain. Do you see the wire that extendsfrom mountain to mountain? We put them there to stop enemyplanes from flying too low. - And when the war started, - I was a little girl. At night, it was my responsibility to take... Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey, come back! Stop! Hey! Ugh! Oh... oh, my god! Psst. Stop! Get off of her or I will shoot. Stay down, or I will shoot! Stay back! Shut up! Stop! Wait, what? What's he saying? Uh, he is saying that you are very brave, and that we all respect you for what you did. Really? Yes. Tell him I said, thank you. You're a good man, Mr. Matsak. Thank you. War. War. War. OK, all right. All right, all right. Hi. Hi. This is a gift from our village. Thank you. Hi. This is my seat. Oh, thank you. Jesus. Right. I hate awkward silences. Me too. I wish I could just take youback to California with me. Show you we have a lot ofgreat historical sites too. Disneyland, Starbucks, El Pollo Loco. That's nice, but I can't. Why not? Because my everything is here. My mother, my village, my friends, my school. Everything is here. Ladies and gentlemen, now please fix the back of yourseats to the upright position and fasten your seat belts. OK, well, I guess this is it. I guess. Goodbye. Bye.
