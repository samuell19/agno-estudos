Where were you during Lauds? Why did you miss Lauds? She got out last night, and I had to find her. Took me all morning. - She got out again? - Yeah. Do you think she's getting through the gate? You think she could get through the gate? I should check the gates. Or maybe she got through the wall. How would she get through the wall, though? I don't know. Why do you care about the donkey so much? I don't. It just doesn't make any sense. Why are you wearing your black habit? It's spring. Because it was dark when I left, and it was the closest thing to me, so I grabbed it. I'm gonna change. Why are you asking me so many questions? Beautiful morning, Sisters. - Hey, don't fucking talk to us! - Fucking creep. - I told you to never talk to us,... - How dare you, fucker? - You piece of shit! Get the fuck out of here! - You fucking moron! Blessed art thou, O Lord. Teach me to know thy will. By these lips, let the awards thou makest ever be recorded. Blithely, as one that has found great possessions, I follow thy decrees. Bethinking me still of the charge thou givest, I will mark thy footsteps. Be thy covenant ever my delight, thy words kept in memory. Christ the Lord was tempted and suffered for us. Come, let us adore him. So, why weren't you at Lauds this morning? Because the donkey escaped in the woods, and I had to catch her. The donkey escaped again? Yeah. I think she got through the gate. She got through the gate. - All right. Well... - But I'll make sure it doesn't happen again. Okay, good. I'll tell Father Tommasso. What's going on with Sister Alessandra? She's been so out of it. I don't know. Her dad's probably visiting or something. Again? Yeah. She's fucking delusional. Yeah. She's so delusional. She's... pathetic. Like, just because your dad gives money to the convent, doesn't mean you're gonna get everything you want. Yeah. I walked in on her the other day, and she was literally just staring out the window for, like, 10 minutes, not moving. - Really? - She's probably, like,... daydreaming about some... guy that's gonna magically come and take her away from here. It's like, "Good luck." I know. So, what was Mother Marea saying to you earlier? Nothing. Mind your own fucking business. Okay. But I'll do that. Yeah. I can sweep it if you want me to. For some reason, it keeps getting unorganized, and I'm not really sure who's doing that. Okay, yes, maybe you could sweep the cellar, because that's very dusty, you know. That's the cellar and the altar. I can organize all the incense, because, for some reason, it keeps getting all messed up, and I'm not really sure who's doing that. But also, Mother, there's something else you should know. Yes? Last night, at dinner... - Mmm-hmm. - I saw Sister Latizia take two portions. I don't know. Maybe you're not counting, so... Maybe it doesn't matter. Just in case you are, it was Sister Latizia. I don't think you should be concerning yourself with the amount somebody is eating. We all require different amounts of food. I know that some days I need more food, some days less, so... watching me eat so carefully, that would make me uncomfortable. So, I don't think you should be bothering yourself with that. Yes, Mother. Hi, Dad. Hi, sweetheart. - How are you, my angel? - I'm good. - How are you? - I'm well. - You look beautiful. - Oh. - Thank you. - What I can make out. Yeah. You look terrific. Are they feeding you? Eh... They should be feeding you, for all the money we send them here. But you look, you look beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. How's Mom? Mom is good. Mom is... Everybody's well. Good. The merchant Ricardo, how's he? Merchant Ricardo? Uh, yes. Glad you brought it up. - He's good. - Has he asked about me? Sure. - You bet he has. - Hmm. You know, last time you and I spoke, I was hoping that we'd have the whole dowry situation locked up, and, um,... we're not there just yet. They're asking for a lot of money. And, uh,... you know, with the money we're sending here, and then to your sisters and their children, it's a... There's a lot of money going out, not that much coming in. - So... - But maybe if we... sent less money here to the convent, we could save it up, and... I could even come and live with you and Mom and... I don't think sending less money here is a good idea, because, uh, that would reflect badly on the family. But I know how eager you are to be married. My baby, I know. But maybe, it's... Maybe that's not... your calling. How's your embroidery going? - You still doing that? - Mmm-hmm. Good, 'cause you're so good. And maybe, that's your calling. You know? Some people, it's marriage and family and the warmth of a home, and maybe for you it's... It's the detailed embroidery. You know, keep... Please. Keep your... Keep your chin up. Give me... Give me a little sugar. Hey, hey, sweetie. All right. Daddy loves you. I love you. Okay. All right, you take care, and... You don't... Don't, don't you lose hope. The body of Christ. Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. Are you all right? The body of Christ. So, Sister Alessandra, how was your father's visit? Good. Good? Yes. It was good. Any potential suitors? That's not even what his visit was about. We didn't even talk about that. Then what was his visit about? Oh, my God! Hey, I told you not to fucking look at us, you creep. I'm sorry. I... Why are you making eye contact with us? Look at the ground, you fucking pervert! - I'm sorry. - What is this shit? This is a turnip. That's not a turnip! It's shit! Ouch! You expect us to eat shit? You're a piece of shit! Yeah, you are a piece of shit. You're disgusting! Yeah, you are a disgusting piece of shit! Think we can just eat any of this food? We're fucking starving! You can't do anything right! Look at this wall! Look at the stuff you build! It's horrible, You fucking imbecile! What do you even do here? - Please, please. - Think you can talk to us? - Please. - You think you can look at us? - You know who my father is? - Yes! - He deserves this! - He pays you good money... - to do nothing, you little rat! - You deserve this! You're a little fucking rat! What is this, maggot food? - We hate you! - Please, please. - Hoarding all the food, huh? - Please, please. Like a fucking Jew? Is that what you're doing? We're all starving! You know what you did! The person that we hate right now! - You go to hell! We curse you! - You deserve to die! You dirt... All right. - Almost ready? - Father Tommasso, yes. - Almost ready. - Oh, look at this! Isn't it beautiful? That's gorgeous. Who did that? Sister Alessandra. We have to make more of that. That'll go big in town. Tell Lurco to keep that garden gate closed, - because the deer are getting into it. - I will. All right. All right, my friend. Are you ready for a journey? Are you ready? "Know when the leaf parts from the ash "and the branches wizen in the treetop "for through the bark, "the sweet humor of the sap doesn't mount to them "and the birds have fallen silent from their warbling "because of the cold that grips them. "But in spite of this all, "I'm unshaken for I am rejuvenated and prosper "when all the other happiness is wasted. - Terrible... - "And if all my merriment is saddened "to the point of not boasting openly..." - This is... They're not all there to help. - "It hasn't however kept my praise - Let's not kidding ourselves. - "from gaining me..." - They're not good people. - Lurco... No. I'm leaving. The nuns... No. They spit on me. - Who spit on you? - They spit on me. Lurco, I, I have to leave. I'm about to leave to go to the - to the market to sell the fabrics. - Father, Father... - Please. - I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry. They spit on me. They called me a Jew. - They called me a Jew, Father Tommasso. - Lurco, please. - They called me a Jew. - Please. Please, just wait two days! I want to think we've had a nice life. I think I surround you in uh, a lifestyle... that is pleasant and luxurious. Enjoy this pheasant. Soon as Florence gets here,... we'll be eating chicken... like a bunch of fucking Croatians. I sent another messenger to Florence. Messenger came back. He's dealing with the Guelph soldiers. He's got Florence. He's got Arezzo. He doesn't have Pisa yet. But, he will. And then, he's coming for us. So, I sent a messenger to Arezzo. He's not in Arezzo. He's in Pisa. He's going... He's making a play for Pisa! He doesn't have Pisa yet, but he will. They're weak, like the Guelphs. You know what comes after Pisa? Lucca. He's coming for our silk trade. So, my dear,... enjoy this lavish lifestyle, your two dresses,... your pheasant, your lentils. Live it up. It's coming to an end. This, this Florentine conspiracy thing is getting to the point of, like, he talks about it so much, it's like a mental illness. - I'll be, I'll be fake sleeping. - Mmm-hmm. And he's still going on about it. - "We're gonna lose everything." - Yeah. And that's what... I'm like... At this point, I'm like, "You know what? I hope we do, just so you'll shut up." - Just shut up. - Mmm-hmm. He thinks that, that, that everything that happens is because of them. Yeah, he says a lot of things. He's just bah-lah... It's just... It's not... Even his tone is awful. Yeah? You act like I don't suffer through it, too. I'm right there with you. That sounded like him. - Hmm? - That sounded like him. No, no, that's not him. He's, he's always asleep. Just relax. You're so cute. - I felt like... I thought I heard um... - No, no. All right, we're gonna fuck again. That, that'll help you relax. No. That's him. - No! That's, that's, that is him. - Oh, shit! - Oh, shit. - That's him. Oh, shit. What have you done? Oh, what have I done? Oh, what's out there? Is it the Guelphs? Is it Florence? Are they coming? Go get them! I shall deal with you shortly. I'm petrified. Now I'll know who you are in the morning. We'll settle this in private. I'll tell you what happened, 100%. A demon came in here while we were sleeping and cut our hair. There's no way to prove it's not a demon, so... Which means that it was a demon. What else was it? A warlock? Hey, he's here. Good morning. My liege. You common-born dogs. One of you sluts... thinks he's quite the jester. What the fuck are you looking at? I'll fuck you where you breathe. What was that all about, huh? I saw Guelph men rush into town... Savage beasts,... tearing men from limb to limb. I saw a little boy's head crushed between um... a man's boot and, and a stone. His eyeballs came skittering across. I saw my beautiful... eight-year-old sister, Benicia, cleaved in half with one swipe of a sword... by the Guelphs. She was more beautifully developed as a woman than you are today. You see this copper in my hair? She had the most beautiful hair of this color all over her body. Shut up. Stop talking about this, not at the table, okay? No more eyeballs or squishing and all that kind of stuff. I don't want to hear about any more violence at the table, 'cause I'm eating, and I'm digesting, so stop it. Silence! How dare you? You are weak. I begin to suspect you have Guelph blood coursing through your veins. Oh, no. How did you find out? I will bring the Devil's goad... to your bedchamber this evening. And it will be freshly polished. No. We're not doing that anymore. You're not putting anything in there. Nothing's coming out. Nothing. We'll see about that. I'm not doing that anymore. - I need a refill. - Don't. - Oh. - Please, don't do this. I just need a quick little refill. - Come here. - No, no. Come here. You're insane. - You've been so sweet to me. - Stop, stop. Somebody's gonna catch us! - Mmm-mmm. - Look, look. - You're gonna get me fuckin' killed! - Uh-huh. If someone catches us what we're doing... Jesus, I don't want to hurt you! I don't want to hurt you! - Take your pants off, then. - No, get off! It's like, why are there so many folds in here? Jesus! Oh, shit. Oh, shit. - Bring me his goddamn balls. - Yes, boss. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. God dang it! Your twigs are all over the place. - Keeping up? - I'm coming. - You keeping up? - Just go without me! I'm going without you? I'll get there. Masseto, let's talk about this! Just stop! Stop! Masseto! Come on! Masseto, come on! No running! Masseto! Masseto! Arg! Urg, oh, oh, oh! No! Urg! Huh. Urg. Urg. Oh, no! No. Oh, huh... Father? You stay away! - No, hey, hey. - These are mine! - No, it just looks like you... - You stay away! - They're mine! - Hey, stop! Stop! - I'm just trying to help you! - If you're a bandit,... I will strike you! You can either lose all of your stuff, or you can trust me and let me help you! I was entrusted to take care of these things, and I've ruined this! The sisters made all these things, - and I've lost them in the water. - It's all right. It's all right. - And now I've fallen. - I'm gonna help. Are you, are you all right? I'm drunk! And I have fallen with my cart, and this animal went the wrong way. - Eh, yeah... - All right, all right, all right. Stay down, stay down. Please. Oh, there. - That's it. - All right. I wish there was something I could give you in repayment. - I have no money. But I have wine. - No, Father, I don't need any money. Or wine. That's, that's totally fine. - Yes. - Yeah. Are you sure there's nothing I can do to repay you? I don't know. If, if you maybe had uh, a place for me to stay tonight, I would, I would really appreciate it. - You have nowhere to stay? - Uh, no. Oh, you're coming with me. It was a total disaster. I never should have stopped to speak to Lurco. That's what's held me up. And then I was out at night. I had to drink the wine because I had no water. And then I just didn't realize how drunk I was getting, and I've lost everything! I'm sorry, Father. I wish there was more I could have done. How am I gonna explain that? No, no, it's all right. You've done... You've done a lot. - All right, here you are. - All right, thank you. - Fresh bread for you. - Hmm. Oh, careful. You're going... Take it, take it easy. - It's really, really good. - Yeah. Good, good. I'm... I'm sorry I was so... excited and upset before. I... That's, that's all right. Yeah. Would you like some wine? Bottom up. Up. Up! Uh-uh... Up! Uh-um. I didn't touch it. All right. This has been wonderful. - Too wonderful. - What a blessing! The best blessing... - I have ever experienced. - You saved me! You saved me! Are you kidding? I'm not kidding. I didn't save you. I couldn't even put it, the wheel of the donkey cart back on. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been... uh, years,... uh, many years since my last confession. - Hmm. - Here are my sins. I have slept with another man's wife. He's a nobleman, and he is my master. Well, that's adultery. - I know. - It's a very serious sin. Sometimes,... she would place her mouth around my sex. Mmm... Well, that's sodomy. Hmm. It's also a serious sin. Is it also considered sodomy if... if I placed my mouth on her sex while... she simultaneously had, had her mouth around mine? Why would you do that? Because, because she, she liked it. Hmm. Well, yes, that's also sodomy. I thought sodomy uh, was, was just when I would... when, when someone would penetrate um, the, the, the rear, the rear end. Yes, that's... that's also sodomy. That's the traditional... uh, form of sodomy. - Right. - Did you do that? I, I did. Yes, I, I... That, that also occurred. But you didn't spill your seed in the rear end? No, no, I did not. Good, good. I, I would spill my seed on her, um... on her back... or on her bosom. Um, but, but most of the time, she would uh, request that I spill my seed all over her face. Well... These are serious sins. And um... And do you regret doing these things? I've, I've learned my lesson. I really have. And I just... I don't want to be that person anymore. If I go back out on the road, they, they will catch me, and they will kill me. Well,... I'll give you your penance. - I want you to say 10 Hail Marys... - Yeah. - and 15 Our Fathers. - Yes. Now, as to the other situation... about you being pursued,... I think I may have a solution... that can be a blessing to both of us. Yes, thank you, Father. Thank you. - Good morning, Marea. - Good morning. - Is it a good time? - Yes. I'd like to introduce you to someone. This is Masseto. - He's a deaf-mute. - Oh. I met him on my trip and spoke to his family, and they explained to me that he's very good with gardening, light carpentry. I think he could help us repair the cloister and, and do all of the things that Lurco was doing. And I thought the fact that he's a deaf-mute,... there would be a lot less conflicts with the sisters. I can't believe you met a deaf-mute on your trip. How was your trip? Did you sell any fabrics? We should talk about it in private. But you said he was a deaf-mute. Right. Um... I was robbed. - Were you hurt? - No, no, no. I'm fine. I wasn't hurt. But, the bandits took everything. - Oh. - They took all the embroidery,... all of the silk, so I made no sale. I've come back empty-handed. I'm sorry. What can I say? I'm very embarrassed, but... It's gonna be fine. All right. Don't worry too much about it. I'll get him started. We go. We go. Hi. Who are you? I'm Sister Ginevra. What are you doing? You're digging a ditch? You're digging a ditch. All right. Since God is perfect, it's our job to live in unison... with His essence. But sometimes,... it's difficult to find that happiness. And things don't go our way. And... we feel like we're being punished, and it's not... Thank you, Sister Fernanda. Thank you. Of course. Um... But God... God is, is perfect. Fernanda! That's enough! - This is... - What? Viola, go inside and finish your reading. Stop it! Stop that! What are you doing? I said stop that! That is enough! What's gotten into you today? Nothing. I'm so sorry. You know what? I'll just go scoop some dung - or scrub the cellars and not bother you - I don't know where this is coming from. while you walk in... Did he just smile at you? - I don't know. - Why is he smiling? - Who is that? - I don't know. Wait, who the fuck are you? Who are you? - Who are you? - Fernanda, stop! He's an intruder. I don't know who the fuck he is! Let me get Mother Marea! Fine! Go! Tell me who you are. What? Say something! Where did you come from? What is that? What are you doing with your hands? What? What, you're hungry? What is that, a bird? You're praying? What the fuck are you saying to me? Fucking tell me who you are! Don't chop his head off! He is Masseto! He's a deaf-mute! He works for us! Father Tommasso hired him. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it. You're always complaining about how Lurco talks to you, and... Masseto doesn't talk. So, I would really like you to give him a chance. Please! All right. All right. And, Sister... I need to speak to you. Come. You can get up now! He can't hear you. Why are you defending him? Now! Father Tommasso was attacked by a group of bandits, and... - No. - He uh... Well, all the embroidery was stolen. So everything I've done, everything I've worked on is... gone? Yes, I'm afraid... that's what happened. - Right. - Are you all right? Yeah. It's... I know this is a lot to... to swallow. I'd be more than happy to get you... extra help for... the work, which will be doubled... to make up for... everything that was lost. Hello? Um... Hi. Um... I broke this. Can you um... fix... this, yes? You've... really kind eyes. Sorry to just spring this on you. It's only 'cause they just sprang it on me. You know, they just asked me to double production of my embroidery out of nowhere. And I'm basically doing it alone. They told me that they would give me help, and then they just stuck me with this... like, shriveled up, old, comatose woman. And, you know, I look at her, and I just... I see me. That's what I'm gonna become. I'm just gonna waste away here. This is not what I imagined for myself, you know. What are you doing? Why are you hiding in the weeds like an animal? I just saw Sister Alessandra go into the toolshed. But, I know he's not saving up money for merchant Ricardo. This is like... It's not even his fault. There's just no hope anywhere in the world. It's so sad and depressing. There's no hope for any of us. Yes, look at you. Look at you. You can't speak. You can't hear. It's not fair! You're just stuck here with all these bitches. And so am I! I just don't even know what to do! It's so unfair. What the fuck is she doing in there? I have no idea. Let us pray. Lord, give our bodies restful sleep... and let our work we have done today be sown for an eternal harvest... through Christ, our Lord. Amen. Lord, grant us a quiet night and a perfect end. Amen. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been three days since my last confession. And what is it you would like to confess? Yesterday, I walked by the garden, and I picked a turnip and I ate the whole thing, and I didn't share it with my sisters. Hmm, and you regret this? Yes, Father. Because it was greedy, wasn't it? - It was, Father. - Hmm. Anything else? Yes, Father. I've been having impure thoughts. Hmm. And have you acted on these thoughts? No, Father. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two days since my last confession. And what do you wish to confess? The other day, I found a turnip in the garden and I ate it all by myself, and I didn't share it with my sisters. - And it was so delicious... - Sister. Ginevra just told me the same story. Did you overhear her confession? No. Fine. Do you have anything else to confess? - No, I have nothing else to confess. - Well, you missed Lauds, Sister. - That's something. - Well, that's because... the donkey escaped in the woods, and I saved her. You should be thanking me, Father. Look,... I'm, I'm just gonna... I don't know what to do here. If you don't confess, - God can't forgive you, so... - I have nothing to confess. All right. Well, just go and think about what you've done. - Let's try it again next week. - Yes, Father. Oh. Oh. First day. First day. Thank you. - Thank you. - You survived. Mmm-hmm. How's it going? Yeah, no, all the work itself, it went really smoothly. And I, I, I did a lot of great work in the cloister, and... that was good. And I um... I, I met a few of the, the sisters, and they were... They were, they were, you know, very interesting. And, and just grateful... grateful to be here, so... These girls can be tough. I'm not gonna lie. - They can be very tough. - Really? - And violent. - Violence? I... Wow, I just, I find that, I find that so hard to believe. They were, they were so lovely. They physically... have attacked people. So, if anything happens,... just tell me. - Yes, I... - Whatever it is, I can fix it. But, you have to tell me. I mean, this deaf-mute thing is there to protect you. Exactly. And to keep the sisters away from you. 'Cause they can have a pack mentality. Ultimately, this is gonna be a very positive influence. Living ethically every day, serving God. It's really gonna fortify your soul. Yeah, you're right. I, I think I can learn a lot by... watching the sisters and everyone around, who, who seem very ethical and, yeah. Cheers. Mmm. Actually, I was gonna, I was gonna ask you. Is, is, is it, is it all right that we keep drinking the sacramental wine? Well... I blessed it. So... - You, you blessed it, so it's... - I mean,... don't mention it to anyone else, but... How could I? I'm, I'm deaf and mute, remember? - Hi. - Hi. You're not going to bed, are you? No. Do you have anything to drink? What do you want? Father Tommasso left the ambry unlocked. Hi. I'm Marta. She's my childhood friend. - Yeah, yeah, her childhood friend. - We grew up together. - Uh, this friend... - Are you drunk? No. - And um, get the broom... - Then you should have more. Your room's gorgeous. Yeah. My dad got it for me. Why is it so big? It's a lot bigger than your room. Is it? I've never been in your room. Yes, you have. No. Shh! Shh! Don't laugh. Shh, shh. What are you doing? Nothing. Go back to bed. - I can't sleep! You're too loud! - Get outta here! Let me. - Get the fuck in here! - What, what are you doing here? - Shut the fuck up. - What are you doing? - What? Who, who are you? - Shh! - Hi. - That's Marta. - I'm Marta. - Ah. You have an accent. Where are you from, the south? - Oh, my God. - Are you from Umbria? No. What's she talking about? - I sound just like you. - No. She's from here. - You're not from Gartagnana. - Yes, she is. You do not sound like you're from Gartagnana. - Maybe, you should drink... - Are you drinking the sacramental wine? - Yes. - No. - Father Tommasso drinks it all the time. - I'm gonna tell Mother Marea. I'm gonna tell Mother Marea. - Why are you always telling on people? - Why are you choking me? - Yeah, thanks. - Shut up. - Just drink it. - A little bit of it. - Sister Alessandra wants you to drink. - Ginevra, it's fine. Nothing matters in life. We're all gonna die. Terrible things are happening - all the time. - You're not allowed to have - visitors here. - Just enjoy - You're not allowed... - this moment. - We're all gonna die. - And just drink a little wine. Wine. - But we're not gonna get in trouble? - Do it. Do it. Whoo! Mmm. Oh. That tastes bad. That's bad. I think there was sand in it. ♪ Tee-tee-tee Tuu-tee-tee ♪ ♪ Tuu-tee-tee Tuu-tee ♪ ♪ Heh-ho Heh-ho ♪ ♪ Tee-tee-tee Tuu-tee-tee ♪ ♪ Tuu-tee-tee Tuu-tee ♪ ♪ La-la-la-la La ♪ ♪ No-no-no-no-no No ♪ ♪ No-no-no-no-no No ♪ ♪ No-no-no-no-no No ♪ ♪ No-no-no-no-no ♪ ♪ La-la-la-la La-la-la La-la-la ♪ ♪ - La-la-la-la La-la-la La-la-la ♪ ♪ - La-la-la La-la-la ♪ ♪ Da-ra-ra-ra ♪ Is it true that you've never... been touched by a man, or touched a man?

You have no idea. In fact, it's so good that I've heard of women... who make this potion out of this plant belladonna... just to seduce men. We can't do it. Because we would get locked up. - Hmm. - Yeah, it's a mortal sin. - We wouldn't get into Heaven. - No? It's a mortal sin. Yeah, then you probably shouldn't do it. Probably shouldn't do it.

Okay. Bye. Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth, peace to people of good will. We praise you. We bless you. We adore you. We glorify you. We give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God. Heavenly King, O God, Almighty Father... Last night was nice. Are you tired? Yeah. Yeah, me too. You feel okay? No, I don't feel good. - I had fun. - I said I don't feel good. Can you please stop talking? Well... Okay. Hi, ladies. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? Um... I was just in the neighborhood. - What? - I'm kidding. Uh, no, my veil... just got a little dirty, and I knew you girls were here,... and I thought I'd come visit, and... and wash it with you guys. You're gonna wash your own veil? Yeah. - Why not? - You never wash anything. Wasn't last night so fun? How'd your veil get so dirty? Um... Well earlier, I was in the garden, and the new handyman was there digging a ditch, and I just thought I'd help him out. You dug a ditch? It was actually, it was really fun. So, what do I do? Do I just dip it in the, in the water? It's so... Ooh, it's... it's really dirty over here. Well... First you put it in the water, and then... you bring it over to the bowl that has the ash, and you... put it in the bowl, and you put the ash on top of it, and then you let it sit for a day. So then tomorrow, you would come back and... take it out of the bowl, and then you... rinse it really well in the water, And then you wring it out, and then you hang it up on the line. Sounds like you are really good at this. So, maybe I'll just hmm... I'll leave it here with you. This is great, huh. Thank you. Bye, you guys. Bye. Guess I would have ended up washing this eventually. Here, finish this. I have to go tidy up the cellar. Here it is. Oh, yup. Yeah, there should be enough here. Sister Fernanda? Just have to remember not to get this in your mouth, okay? I know. Take off the nun thing. You'll get it all over it. Okay, you ready? Yeah. All right. Go for it. Just going to... make you look a little more... Presentable. Do exactly what I tell you to do. Uh-huh. Make sure he sees your eyes. Okay, kiss him. Give her... Come on. Hmm... Okay. Get closer. Careful with the knife. Take it all in. Okay. Get on top of him. Push your sex into his stomach. Do it now. All right. He'll do. What were you doing in there? Hi. Where'd you come from? I was just picking root vegetables. Are you really from Gartagnana? Yes, I'm really from Gartagnana. Why do you keep asking me? You've asked me, like, 25 times... You are the most annoying! Are you, are you ignoring me? No. I feel like you're ignoring me. I'm not. Can I ask you a question? Yes. Did last night mean anything to you? No. We were just drunk and having fun. Forget about it. All right. Masseto, Masseto, Masseto. Oh, I'm, I'm actually, I'm, I'm all right right now. Oh! All right. Yeah. How's it going? A good day. - Yeah, I um... - Okay. I don't know. I can, I can kind of... kind of picture myself maybe being here a while. Really? You think you could stay on? - If you'd, if you'd have me, yeah. - Oh. Are you kidding? That would solve a lot of problems. And how's it going with the sisters? That's all right? I think they're, I think they're kind of warming up to me. - Good. Good, good. - Yeah. - Not too much? - No. Definitely... Definitely not too much. It's the, the right amount, feels like. Ah, anyway, let's have a toast,... just a quick toast, and then... maybe head over to confession. - Yeah. - You know, like we do. I think I'm good tonight, just 'cause I'm gonna... Feeling a little tired. It's been a long day. All right. But, it's bad luck to put it back in the pitcher. So, let's, let's just have this one, and then... Here? Hello? Are you alone? - Of course. - I thought I heard someone. No, no, no. I was talking to myself. Let's take a little walk. Bishop Bartolomeo. - Hello. - Father Tommasso. - Muah. - Muah. - Good to see you. - Thank you. - Come in. Come in. Come in. - Hello. Here. Let me take this. You must be exhausted. - Very tired, very long trip. - So good to see you. So good to see you, too. Somewhat unexpected. - Looks great. - But... We'll, we'll... We'll get it together for you. Oh, yes. I'm sure you will. Oh, shit! ...little migated to wild force. Knock-knock. Nothing around here? - No one is disappeared... - Oh. And you know Alessandra, - Ilario's daughter? - Ilario's daughter, of course. Hi. His business is not doing very well at the moment. - Oh, that's terrible. - Sorry to say it, yeah. Yeah. I want one of those. We can get you one. Yes, it's yours, it's yours! - Thank you, Sister Alessandra. - - Thank you. - Nice to see you. - We appreciate your time. And we all went out to the field and worked on a single plot. Hmm. I see your point, but I'd like you to focus here. - No, don't. - This... I'm, I'm fine with March. In February, how did you sell textiles before they were sold? I like what you're saying, and if you... - Because... - No. But,... - this is March. I'm fine with March. - This is more... Mother Marea, I need to talk to you about Sister Fernanda. - Is she all right? - Well, she's acting very suspicious. And I've learned some things I think you'd want to know. You know how she's been saying that the donkey escaped? - It's not escaping. - Okay, this is not the right time. She's been lying about it the whole time. No, she's lying about it. You'll want to know about it. I'm so sorry about that. Have you seen these numbers? - Have you... Who...? - I, I supervise in general. add the numbers, but... There's something going on with Fernanda. - She said that she was completing... - Sister, please keep your voice down. - She was in... - She wasn't there! - She was clearly lying. - How many times do I have to... - She had a friend over, - How did you find out, she... - and she drank alcohol. - I've never seen her drunk. Did you try... She's staying up! I hear her up all night. What is going on? She's clearly lying about the donkey escaping. Why would she lie about the donkey? I don't know why she's lying, but I checked the walls, and I checked all of the gates. There's no way that donkey's escaping. I think, I think that donkey needs someone else to take care of her. I can take care of her. I will consider it. - Thank you, Mother. - We'll discuss this later. Isn't that amazing, Sisters? That Rose had the ability to predict the exact day of the death of Frederick II. I think we all have this ability to connect deeply with God. I share the story, because we don't always listen to God. Hey! What's going on? You can speak? No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. I heard you. I heard you! Tell me what's going on right now, or I'm gonna tell everyone here that you, you've been tricking us! All right, all right, all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not, I'm not supposed to talk to you. You're not supposed to talk to me? What does that, what does that even mean? Hello? - Hello? - Shh! - Get down. Get down. - Can you hear me? Can you, can you hear me? No, you can't hear me. Can you hear my thoughts? 'Cause I can hear your thoughts. I can hear your thoughts. Hi. Oh. This... This feels different. Hmm-hmm. I, I think I like sex with girls. I never told anyone. I have lots of secrets. I'm Jewish. Nobody knows, but now you know. Hmm, but you don't know, 'cause you can't... You see angels... Do you see the angels? I see the angels. Oh, oh, I hear 'em. I hear 'em. Oh, they know. They know I'm here. They know I'm here. Oh, oh, God. Okay. What are you doing here? I'm just looking through the hay. Shh! Shh!!! Fernanda! - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Fernanda! Why is there blood all over your face? Get out of my way! Fernanda? Fernanda? - Quiet, quiet. - What? Over there. Come on. They have the donkey. Oh, jeez. Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm gonna throw up. Okay, okay, okay. Let it out. I'm not gonna throw up. Okay, okay. Let's keep moving. We're gonna keep going. - Keep going. - I'm so hot. - Why am I so hot? - I don't know. Oh, I'm so thirsty. Gotta keep going. - What is the lights? - Shh! Shh! Shh! Look at the lights. Shh! What is it? I took some belladonna. - I took the belladonna. - What? She had it. She had, she had the sex. So I was gonna have the sex. So I did belladonna so I could have the sex. And then, and then, and then... Witches. They're witches! He's making a lot of noise. It's okay. He's a deaf-mute. Yeah, well, maybe we should gag him. There's no point. He can't talk. Shut up. Ginevra, no. Ginevra, come back here. Ginevra, get back here! Stop! For so it was placed when the goddess embraced. The horned lord, our god, who taught her the word. Which quickened the womb and conquered the tomb. The spear to the Cauldron. Lance to grail, spirit to flesh. Sun to moon. Forever your flame is the male. No, don't fucking kill me. No, don't, please. Don't fucking kill me! I'll do anything. - Please! - We cured him. - Please! - There's absolutely no way. - I'm telling you, he was a deaf-mute. - You know nothing. This is a fertility ritual. You know, I said, I told you to gag him. It'll be great if you just listen next time. Shh!!! Okay. What are you all looking at? Why are you looking at me? What is she doing here? What? Uh!!! Oh!!! Why are looking at me? Why are looking at me? What the fuck is going on? Ginevra! Calm down. Put the totem down. You do not belong here. - Give it to me. - You don't belong here! You don't be... - No, No. - You don't belong! - Oh, ouch! - You... Spirit to flesh. Sun to moon. - Arg!!! - Shh!! Quiet! Fernanda! Stop this! God, what are you doing here? I won't let you kill him! Stop it, Alessandra! I need to have sex with him! - Ouch! - Why are you... - Shit! - Why are you even here? You know the powers that belongs... Ow! You're a witch? This is crazy! And you were lying to us this whole time? Yes, explain yourself! All right, all right, all right. These, these, these people, they want to kill me, - and I, I went on the run, and... - This is my donkey! She's trying to take my donkey. We have to get her. She's out of control. - All right, all right, let's, let's... - Hey, enough with the knife already. Fine. Oh, shit. Oh. Hmm. Oh. Oh. That fucking bitch. You need to know what's going on! You need to know! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! You need to know what's going on! Just a minute. I'll be right there. What are you doing? - It's the middle of the night! - They're witches! They're witches! You need to know about the witches! They're out there in the woods! They're out there in the woods! - Put your clothes on. - Fernanda's a witch. - And her friend's a witch! - Calm down! They're all out there! Father Bartolomeo, you need to know. There are witches. She's a witch! She is a witch! - I am not a witch! - Stop! - You've been... - You're just jealous. No, I am not. Why are you wearing your winter habit? - I saw him first. - Why is the handyman here? What do you mean, you saw him first? You don't even like men! You're sexually attracted to women. I am sexually attracted to men. - What? - I had sex with him! - You are a bride of Christ! - You did not have sex with him. You were just writhing around on him. - You had sex with him, too. - Stop. How dare you? - Bishop, I did not have sex with him. - I'm telling the truth. - Why are you a tattletale, huh? - I know what you're doing with the donkey. And she's my donkey now! - Don't talk about my donkey. - I am on donkey duty now! I am on donkey duty. - What is wrong with her? - She is on drugs! She told me she took belladonna tonight, and she's been dancing around naked in the woods with witches. And she's a Jew! I am not a Jew! - Sister Marea! - I am not a Jew! - I am not a Jew! - Stop talking. - I am not a Jew! - Yes. Stop, stop. Sister Marea! Sister Marea! - I'm not a Jew. - Wake up! I'm not a Jew. I'm not a Jew. Come out here. Look at this. I was sleeping! - Complete chaos! - I'm sorry. - Everyone's awake. - What's on your face? It's the middle of the night. There's a donkey downstairs. Why do you have pants on your head? - Oh. - Okay, I just, please, stop! I can, I can explain everything, all right? - It, it, it's all my fault. - What? I thought you couldn't speak! - He can speak. - Yeah, he can talk. I thought you were a deaf-mute! It's a miracle. We're going to begin the tribunal. Sister Ginevra, these are your sins. Ingestion of drugs,... lying with a woman,... not being baptized. Not being baptized? That's what makes you what you are. You can't, you shouldn't even be coming through those doors! Being a busybody,... filthy conversation,... vain jangling,... drinking,... eating blood. Do you think I've ever written down "Eating blood" before? Where am I? Envy,... fornication,... homosexuality... That's the same as lying with a woman, but we separate those. Lustfulness,... reveling,... mischief in your heart. That's the longest list I've ever had... for sins. Please, have mercy on me. For your punishment,... I'm going to have you fast for one year. Okay. But, I didn't explain it yet. - So, it's not okay. - Okay. Because a human being can't live on not eating. No. I don't mean you're not gonna eat for a whole year. You just pick a meal in the day... and skip it. Okay. So, say, it's lunch. Every day, you've got to skip lunch. - Yes. - And what meal is that? Uh... Based on your suggestion, I'll, I'll skip lunch. It's not my suggestion. You have to feel the sin. I can feel lunch. Sister Alessandra. You know... I'm friends with your father. And now his daughter is doing this? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's embarrassing. For me, I'm embarrassed. How do you think he's gonna feel when he knows this? Please don't tell my father. - There's no need to tell my father. - He's a patron of the church. One of the biggest. And this place is completely in disrepair. It's falling apart. It looks like a barn in Filicaia. Have you been there? - It's disgusting. - It's disgusting! Please, please, please. - Please, don't say that. - I, I think I want to call this place - a Little Filicaia. - No, please. I, I might. Sister Fernanda! These are your sins. Apostasy,... heresy,... - abusive language,... - It's just the tone of my voice. homosexuality,... revelings,... witchcraft. Did you roll your eyes? No. You were rolling your eyes. Sister Marea, I don't know what to say. I am shocked. Fornication? Living in pleasure? You... Sister Marea, you. Loving the world? Why don't you just stay here? Why don't you stay in this world that you love so much? Isn't it fun? Do you have anything to say? I'm so sorry, Your Holiness. Do you care? It, it's just complete... lack of interest... Are you guys smiling at each other? Can you have a moment to not look at each other? You're both out of control. Father Tommasso. I don't even know where to begin. I ask your forgiveness... and I ask God's forgiveness... for failing as the shepherd of this flock. I only ask that you please not punish the sisters of this convent for my failings. Marea. I'm so sorry. He's taken away my priesthood. I have to go to San Biagio and become a monk. I'm so sorry for dragging you into this. You're a good woman. You're a good woman, Marea. - I should be... - What the hell are you doing? Get outta here! You were just crying in there? What's wrong with you? Was lying with Francesca worth it? I really don't want to talk about it. What about that bosom? Very ample. Super ample, plus... it's Bruno's wife. So it had to be so intense. Can you guys please stop talking? You heard what happened to her, right? No. How could I have heard? "At the end of the cold season, "when along the branch "surges the sap that revives the broom and heather. "When the peach trees blossom and the frog sings in the pool "and the willow and elder grow, "as I see the dry months come, "I concern myself with a large orchard "where there are beautiful saplings in many places. "The grafts are large, and the fruit fleshy "on those that should be the worst. "And the blossoms look like those of apples." "But when the fruit comes, "it is nothing but willow and elder. "And since the head is empty, the members at the ends are in pain." Did you finish cleaning the cellar? Yeah, all done. Isn't it so annoying? - So annoying. - I told you. I know. I'm, I'm... sorry I told on you. I'm sorry that I told Mother Marea every time I thought... something wasn't right or, or weird. I'm sorry I ruined your ritual. I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was a witch. But honestly, I... thought eventually, I could turn you all into witches, and you'd join my coven, but I know that sounds stupid. You really think I could be a witch? Yeah. Do you think they're gonna kill him? I don't know what's going on with Giovanni lately. Have you noticed that the carrots they're serving the soldiers are mushier? I was saying the same thing yesterday. I wouldn't even be okay if they were mushy on the outside and crispy on the inside. I don't need, like, a full crisp, but... It could be a little mushy. I'm fine with a little mush. 'Cause this is basically carrot pudding. Where is he? Welcome back. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I've been in Sarzana,... meeting with the family of my new bride. Beautiful young lady who seems like she might be up to fidelity. Imagine that. Once she hits puberty... I have to thank you for doing me an incredible favor. My wife, who had hidden her Guelph ancestry, turned out to be... quite the barren twat. And you've given me every reason to seal her up in a wall with a boar and a dog. I've got some good news... and some bad news. Which would you like first? I don't care. The good news is I'm going to keep you alive for as long as I can. It sounds cheery. The bad news is it's only so that I can inflict as much pain and degradation as I torture your flesh. I'm having a hard time determining... which of my favorite torture methods to start with upon you. Got the thumbscrew. I have a Catherine wheel. I have a rack out back, and it was taking up too much space in here, but, still fully functional. There's a new one called the rat box, just in from Sicily. The rat box, not to be confused with what I call my wife's private area, after you'd been to visit. It's a box of rats with one open side placed against your abdomen. I light a fire on the other side of the box, so that the rats, in their attempts to escape, burrow... through your guts. Anyway,... we'll have a lot of fun together in the coming days and maybe weeks, depending on how tough you are. Don't go anywhere. Shit. There was no... good news in that at all. Hey, um... I'd actually um, I'd, I'd really appreciate it if you guys let me out now. Oh, we can't. You can't do that to us. - Please. - It's a tough position. Hey, hey, we're friends. All right? You don't want to be here either. Just let, let me out. We'll make a run for it. I can't get through all that. He can't make a run for anything. If I die, that's, that's on your conscience. You don't want to live with that. Please. What's... Is there... - Okay. - Yeah? You're gonna have to move quick, - Yes. - especially around the moat. The guards out there have a real thirst for blood. Yes, of course. Thank you so much. - Okay, here I go. - Okay. I'm unlocking you. What are you... There's a turtle with a candle on it! Really? Wait, wait, wait, you guys! Don't, don't leave me! Hey, where are you going? Don't leave! Come on! Just... Please. Stop, you shits! - Let's see what he does. - Shit. What are you doing here? We're getting you out. Hi. Come on! Come on. Whoa, whoa. Come on! No, no, it's okay. I'm giving it to you. You can trust us. We're rescuing you! I embroidered this doll to put in your place. We brought you a lunar habit to hide you in the night. We want to bring you back to the convent. All right. All right, let's go. - I'm gonna need that back. - Put on the habit. Key. Oh, please! All right. Okay. All right. - All right? - Yeah. On your right. Let's go. Let's go, let's go. You think this has something to do with our hair being cut? Paolo, you think we should tell Bruno about that? He's got his hands full with the wife in the wall and everything. We just saw the wildest thing. You would not believe it. Well, it was a turtle... Whoa! Come on, come on. Hello. Tommasso. How are things at the convent? It's lonely. That monastery is so boring. All we do is pray. I mean, it's important, but... It's all men. It's so good to see your face. Someone's coming. Come on! Come on. They're gone. All right, come on.
