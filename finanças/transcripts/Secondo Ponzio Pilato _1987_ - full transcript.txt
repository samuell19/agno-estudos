We are doing very badly, Excellency. Also this year the Jews have not paid their taxes. But not out of rebellion or stinginess, as is commonly believed. What time is it? There is little to the sixth hour. It is almost noon. But as I was saying ... At this hour they will be crucifying him. Precisely. ... I told you that for Jews paying taxes to the state is like ... ... a blasphemy, an impiety. Because according to them man has no other owner than his god. And pay tithes to the emperor ... ... it would be like putting Tiberius in the place of the Lord. They started the road to Calvary at nine o'clock. - How long did it take? - Ah ...! What is it? It's a four-year-old Falerna wine , Excellency. The same one that Taliarco served Horacio in the sabine cup ... ... while the poet gazed into the distance contemplating the Soratte ... ... covered in white snow, and continued with the Carpe Diem speech. In other words, from the "we are pulling". What do I do? - Hail everyone! - Hail! How's that going? See how they come dressed. They look like Assyrians or Babylonians. Everything but Romans. Sight. Well ... we are at the edge of the empire, Excellency. In contact with the customs of the barbarians. They have become brutish. But are we going to be waiting our whole lives? The centurion would like to know what time he can come to pick up the lady. - To go where? - To Cesaria Marítima. He has asked for an armed escort because Jewish rebels infest the area. And what is my wife going to do in Cesaria Marítima? Then embark for Rome, Excellency. Boys! When you are on duty in front of the governor's house, wear your uniform. I don't tell you more times. Yes, centurion. - Look what I told you. - Shut. What are you going to do. Have you seen Valeriano? Claudia Prócula abandons me because ... ... I have had the prophet crucified. He says he knew it was going to end like this. That I knew. He had even dreamed that Socrates interceded for him. What are you going to do. Also Calpurnia, in the Ides of March, ... he dreamed that a tiger was walking through the streets ... ... and that some soldiers were hitting each other between the clouds, ... and that lightning, thunder and blood fell on the Capitol. Caesar, don't come out! - But what are you saying? - I mean ... women ... ... they have premonitions. The thing is... they are like animals. Let's say they are fond of witchcraft. Now oriental mysteries are in fashion . What we lacked among so many Chaldean Jew , Assyrian, Egyptian, Sicilian ... It is crystal clear. They follow the first one with crazy eyes. Everyone follows someone. - Yes And who do you follow? - I, you. I go to my wife's rooms and she is always naked. And who is going to look at it? I have seen everything, Excellency. But when I'm on duty I don't look. There she is, she's still asleep. - My warmest congratulations. - Because? No. I mean ... beautiful! That nude lifts your spirits. Already a little mature ... ... but tasty. That! And thank goodness you weren't looking. The sea ... across the Jordan ... we will be ... fishers of men. Yes... The ax... The ax...? ... the ax is the root of the trunk. - Ahhh! Good grief: the executioner. - Let's hear who it is. - Are you. The executioner of Jerusalem. - We started? I offered the Jewish people an alternative. I said: Christ or Barabbas. If they chose Barabbas, is it my fault? And for four criminals sent by the priests ... ... you have to punish a whole town? In any case, they have killed the prophet. But who is in charge of Jerusalem? Roma. But Rome has the utmost respect for subject peoples ... ... that's why he leaves the local laws inherited from his parents in force. Here there is the Mosaic Law, the Torah, as it is called. And on the basis of it Jesus Christ has been tried and condemned. Pilate, don't cheat. It is you who has condemned it. According to Roman law. Let's see how long this dispute will last. It will become one of the great enigmas of history. Then answer me: Who has crucified him? It is only the execution of a sentence, a formality. - Where is a towel? - I understand now. - Rome only executes the sentences - No: only Rome, executes the sentences. But also, I would like to know why you get so angry. With all the Jews we have crucified! We have planted more crosses in Palestine than trees on the Seven Hills. Thieves, murderers, rebels, zealots given to terrorism, magicians ... One more or one less ...! What was so special about this charlatan? - He was innocent. - Very well. But if there has been a mistake, a judicial error, ... ... the defect is there, ... ... in the device of the sentence. And it always falls, in any case, on who has condemned it. Precisely, Pilate. Be careful! But wasn't it noon? It's noon. Pilate, you are witnessing a wonder. In truth that man was a righteous man ! It doesn't concern me. I am still Jewish. The scripture passage that says: "The gods who have not made Heaven and Earth will perish." - But you weren't going to Rome? - After these wonders? Not anymore. Now I stay here. I want to see what is going to happen. "Why? What else is going to happen?" - Jesus made a promise. He said: "I now die but in three days I will return" - And I want to stay here. - To wait for him to come back. Yes and what? - And you believe it? - I didn't say believe it. - I just said I want to see it. - Is the same. A serious person... ... he is not saying it even as a joke and he does not want to see anything. How can you believe in a Jesus Christ born of a virgin mother ... ... who dies and after three days comes out of the tomb? Oh well! Where has something similar been seen? It had to be in a colony, ... ... on the edge of these lost deserts. Come on, if you count it in Rome ... - ... they laugh at you in the face. - And all this cataclysm that ... ... it just happened concurrently, how do you explain it to yourself, Excellency? An augur will have to be consulted. An omen? We are Romans. Do not forget. And to decipher ... ... mysterious facts we have always interpreted the flight of birds ... ... or the entrails of a dead animal. But people no longer settle for those answers. Tell him too, Valeriano. What beautiful eyes you have, ma'am. Come on, tell him too. I say that in Rome you have conquered the hearts of poets and praetors. Exaggerations. If anything, your head is prettier than ... ... a funerary monument from the Republican era. - Hey ... Valeriano ... - Hey, Pilate. Here's the water ... ... where you have symbolically washed your hands. Oh no! That was a mistake. Thunderstorm Jupiter has collapsed , ... ... even Mars has collapsed . But this lavatory has remained as it was. - How do you explain it? - How do you explain it? - Ah ... I don't know. Ask an augur. Meanwhile I am going home. If you allow, beautiful lady, I'll accompany you. Thanks, Valeriano. They say that the sarcophagi have been opened in the necropolis . The mummies of the prophets and patriarchs have come out. The worms have been shaken off the shroud and ... How do I explain it to myself? What are you doing? Do you surrender arms to him as when a sovereign passes? It was not us. The banners have been lowered themselves, Excellency. It was him. He is a magician. He has done a spell. Out of!. Come in again. Let's see if the spell is repeated. Watch out guys, huh? Because if the eagles bow down I call the executioner ... ... and I have you all cut your throats. Forward the prisoner! And laughs! Do you see how he laughs? Come here. Are you, perhaps, the king of the Jews? Are you the one who says it or have others told you? The Jewish nation, and the priests here Annas and Caiaphas ... ... they have brought you before me who unworthily represents Rome. Therefore, answer me and be careful what you say. An affirmative answer ... ... and you incur a crime of lese majesty ... ... which is punishable by death. So, it's in the name of Rome ... ... I ask you the question: Are you king or not? - Is he deaf? - Nerd. - Then why don't you answer? - He's superb, like a king. He says that he is king but that his kingdom is not of this world. Then it is out of the jurisdiction of Rome! The act does not constitute a crime. Look: it's already dried up ... this is a disaster. Ask him what he has come to do. What have you come to do? - Ask him. - But if you don't answer ... You insist. - What have you come to do? - I have come so that ... ... everyone who is in favor of the truth hears what I say. - And what do you say? - I speak the truth. That doesn't seem like a serious crime to me. - It has worse. - For instance? That of not respecting the law of our parents. Our law says that you have to ... ... rest on Saturdays. He does not. He does not rest. But each one rests when he feels like it. When you like it. The Romans, for example, ... ... we rest after eating. My eyes are closing. If I don't sleep for a while, I fall. Yes, really. Aisss. I can't take it. - Excellency: Esterina has come. - Hold on. Be patient. - What do you want? I'm working! - I have a message from your wife. - Give it to me. - No: it is out loud. - And what does it say? - He says: "Pilate, ... ... do no harm to that righteous man ... ... because today in a dream I have suffered a lot because of him ". - Very well. - Howling like a wolf, Excellency. - I already don't know? - Please tell the magician ... ... not to send you any more dire dreams. Then it gets weird ... - ... and she's nervous all day. - Very well. - Excellency, I am Roman. - And that? To me this Jesus ... - ... I like it very little. - And why do you get involved? It cannot be compared to Moses. High priests: you must accuse him of something more serious. - Heal the sick! - And is that a crime? He has healed a leper and the servant of the centurion of Capernaum. He has healed a paralyzed man and a lady who had been twelve years old ... ... with his things every day. - That too Aesculapius did. But Aesculapius healed by virtue of the sanitary art. He didn't. - And how does it heal? - With magic. Hold. By the way. If it is with the magic that you get into my wife's dreams ... ... I say ... if you can help it, I would be grateful. And with magic ... ... has raised a dead man. - Ah. He has restored sight to the blind of Jericho, ... ... has multiplied the loaves and fishes, ... ... has turned water into wine and walked on top ... In wine? - Thanks. - I ask the permission to talk. I am José de Arimatea, Excellency. Magistrate and priest, member of the Sanhedrin. - Speaks. - I say this: It is evident that this man performs miracles and wonders ... ... that no one had ever done. And then, if the miracles you do come from God, they remain. If they come from men or are witchcraft, they will not remain. - You speak very well. - José talks this way because ... ... has secretly become his disciple. This man has blasphemed! - When? He has not opened his mouth! He said he can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days ... ... when it is known that Solomon ... ... it took forty-six years to build. He was speaking figuratively. He was referring to the temple of his body. And it is also not blasphemous. It's boastful. But it is blasphemy as he says he can do it because he is king. - Yes, but from a kingdom that does not exist. - From the kingdom of heaven, he says. What kingdom is that? A kingdom that is entered only ... if one becomes small, and the smallest will be the largest of all. - And the last will be the first, and vice versa. He says so. Anarchy! - Look how it burns. - I think. - Excuse me. - Of course. This is not the Messiah expected by the people of Israel. - And who is it? - An impostor. No! Who is the Messiah? It is not necessarily a person. - It could also be a time. - A time? - A time. - A time? When swords become plowshares. And the people of Israel are gathered in this land ... ... that the lord has promised. Boys! I caught you there, huh? All Palestine is a Roman province. And your Lord cannot promise it to anyone. But what do they want? Get it back? Sure, because the Messiah is their deliverer. It will liberate the people of Israel from Roman rule. But it will also punish collaborative priests. That's why they want him dead. Because they fear that he is really the Messiah. It is not true. This man deserves death because by proclaiming himself a son of God ... ... asserts something false. - Agree. But with this sun ... ... it takes very little to go crazy and say one thing for another. Ay And also the desert ... - You wash your hands? - Huh? You have submerged your hands in the water. Oh no. Look: I have a pulse that beats like a drum. With all due respect: this weather is killing me. But it could be interpreted ... Interpret! But, What are you telling me? And now, speak. Say in the name of the living God: Tell us who you are. Tell us if you are the Christ, the son of the god of Israel. You said it. But I tell you: from today you will see the son of man ... ... sitting to the right of the father. He has blasphemed! You have all heard the blasphemy! He is not the Messiah. And it will come with the clouds of heaven. - Baruch Aba Adonai! - That? I have said: blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. ¡Baruj Aba! Excuse me if I bother, Excellency ... ... but I ran into your wife and she told me you were here. What do you want? Permission to remove the body of Jesus from the cross ... ... and to bury him. Tomorrow is Easter day and it is customary for corpses ... ... of the executed do not remain exposed in the days of the Lord. Do you know what the law says? Well no. The sun must not set on someone who has been executed. Very well. If he is dead there is no problem. Thank you very much, Excellency. I have no words. - Shalom and take care. - Shalom. Joseph! Only for curiosity. But in case he was ... Now this blood on who falls? About the Jewish people? Are you kidding? At worst it could just relapse ... about the High Priest who exposed himself in person. What did the people do? Here in Jerusalem, not even one percent of ... ... all the Hebrews scattered throughout the world ... ... who have never heard of Jesus. And furthermore, do you know what he said before he expired on the cross? No, I do not know. I was not there. He said: Father, forgive them ... ... because they don't know what they're doing. - Ah, well ... - So don't worry: - ... he has forgiven you. - Ah! - Me too? - He has forgiven everyone. - Then me too. - Calm down. But I am calm! He has forgiven me, the Governor of Rome! But who does he think he is? - What's up? - They are the Priests Annas and Caiaphas. After eating? This is a chase! - What are you doing? - I leave you alone. Among murderers you will find yourself better. - Sorry for the inconvenience. - Please...! What do I owe ...? It's about the carpenter again. - Why did you give his body to José? - Shouldn't I? - We preferred that he had stayed ... ... on the cross until the birds had eaten him. Well! The worms will eat him up! - Yes, but it's not the same, right? - No. Because the trickster promised that he would rise again ... ... three days after his death. You say it as if you believe it too. We do not. But now his disciples are going to steal his body ... ... and they will say to the people: look, he is risen. Well, let them say it. Please! Never mind! Never mind? The consequences would be incalculable. Try to think ... A man dies ... ... and after three days it comes back to life. What is it? What is it like? Something incredible. Exactly. Amazing. But suppose you believe. That you think a man was crucified, died ... ... and buried and on the third day rose from the dead. What he has said or preached is no longer so important . Only that event matters. Because for the first time, ... ... in history, a dead man has come back to life. Yes, of course, the ghosts: returning shadows of the dead. And who believes in them? Only the Etruscans. You have not understood, Excellency. He has said that he will return in the flesh ... - ... and it will be the first. - The first and the last. The first born from the dead. And it will come with the promise that ... ... after him, all will be resurrected. - In the flesh. - Are you beginning to understand? And then think that all those who attend ... ... to that prodigy they will be able to say: "I believe". Has there been a more complete revolution in the world than this? It was a crazy night, with the shepherds coming down from the mountain ... ... when it was nine o'clock. And the angels that came down from heaven ... ... and they made a ruckus around the barn singing Gloria in Excelsis. And thieves, murderers, schemers arrived, ... tax collectors, horse thieves ... - ... and whores. - Whores? Yes. Because he has not come for the righteous. He has come for sinners. He has said it. I was a simple legionnaire then. And I was fulfilling my obligation from Thebes to Memphis, on the other side ... ... from Sinai to the Persian Gulf. Then to Damascus ... ... the land of the two rivers. I've seen a lot of people. But ... the child ... has stuck with me. Some nights I dream about him. And once it appeared to me ... ... being awake. He looked at me sweetly and said: "I am the word" And what does it mean? I do not know. But do you think he really is the Messiah? These are the lands of the Lord. I have been fertile for thirty years ... ...Half Moon. But never in my whole life have I seen anyone ... ...resurrect. Therefore if resurrected, I will believe. - Ah ... Valeriano. - Hey, Valeriano. Alas, there it is. Get ready, we have to go. If resurrected, I will believe. ¡Alto! Put it down. Everything is in order, Excellency. - Who has verified the death? - Yo, sir. - What's your name? - Longinus, Excellency. I even stabbed the spear into his side. But it didn't move at all obvious sign of death. Unlike the two thieves. Those were alive. Alive and kicking. Heh And then we have broken their tibias with hammer blows. Come on ...! It's the crurifragio, Excellency. What is done to the crucified ... ... to help them die quickly. According to the regulation. I have seen some who were on the cross for weeks ... ... and to kill them they pounded their heads and not their lumps. Yes, but with him it was not necessary. He died in no time. And what the scriptures say was fulfilled : "And not even a bone in his body will be broken" Ah, so the writing says ... So he died in no time. Yes, but look at his constitution: he is graceful. In my opinion it was a brutality to kill him. So it would have died on its own. But Valeriano! Have you never seen a dead man? I was thinking that I saw him born. And those who cry, who are they? They are the Marías, Excellency. What does it mean? Nothing, the three are called Mary: Mary of Magdala, Mary of Cleophas, and the other is the Virgin Mary, the mother. José: When are you going to bury him? - What when do we bury it? - Yes. Right now, with your permission. Good very good. But do it quickly, eh? You, supervise the operation and stand guard here. - And so we will see if he resuscitates. - Go easy, Excellency. As long as we are on duty here, no one resurrects. Of course. With you on guard I would be afraid of that occurrence. And now where will they bury you , José ... ... since you have given your burial to Jesus. Why? Do I have to die? If tomorrow weren't a party , you'd already be dead. For now you stay in jail. Sunday morning... ... you will be tried for high treason. You can't do this to me. I am a member of the Sanhedrin! You can't ... And now that José is locked in there, it is highly unlikely that ... ... Jesus may resurrect. O ye stars in the sky, Apollo and Diana, lady of the woods! Hear the song that the sibyl orders up to the gods! To whom the seven sacred hills were very dear ! ¡Noble sol! In the shiny car always the same and always different ... ... you are born to bring the day! That while the light lasts ... ... nothing can you see bigger than Rome! - Precious, precious. - But what are you saying? That was Horacio: Carmen Seculare. Any! - It has disappeared. - He's gone. Why do you look for who is alive among the dead? Where are you going? But what has happened? What have we done? What have we done? We have killed the Lord. People are coming. They are the Marias who return. Poor girls. No. Poor us , now what do we say to Pilate? What does he do, where does he go? Are you crazy? Longinus! But where are you going? Come back, Longinus! It is no longer here. He is risen. Tell the apostles. Tell Peter that he precedes them in Galilee. Good! Bravo! Nice soldiers we have! Glad to hear it! We are in good hands. Longinos has deserted. The dead man has disappeared. This will delight my wife. "Claudia! The dead man has escaped from the grave!" You are happy? So you will stop dreaming about it. So is it true? He is risen! The priests were right. José de Arimatea has teased me. But if I catch him I send him to the galleys for twenty years: desecration of grave and concealment of corpse. - What corpse? - The corpse of the dead man, that ... ...it has disappeared! - No one has made him disappear. - We were all there. - He really must have been resurrected. - That? - That's what the angel said. Remove! - What angel? - There was an angel sitting on the grave. An angel from heaven? With curls, my lady. And he said to the Marys: tell my disciples that ... ... I precede them in Galilee. - Ah! Romans: long ago we had a reputation for being people with our feet on the ground. But now you see angels and she lives on dreams. - If they're not dreams ... - Please don't spread the word. Don't scare people with this nonsense. Angels do not exist and the dead do not go to Galilee. They are not going anywhere. Who have you told so far? To nobody. Only you know. He is risen! Hosanna! He has kept his promise! - And how do you know? - I heard it at the market. - A fruit vendor was commenting on it. - Good thing only I knew! - And how did the fruit bowl know? - And what do we know? Ah, what do we know ... Do you think we talk to fruit growers? - Then it was you! - Me? Let me go blind right now. I degrade them! I repatriate them! - I'm sending you to Rome! - Hopefully! Hopefully, you bastards? - You dreamed of the truth, my lady. - And you too. Do you remember the child who told you "I am the word"? - Now do you think? - Yes! Because coming this way ... ... I have met an old man all gray ... ... with a triangle on his head ... ... who told me: "I am the word". - The old man too? - Yes, but it was still him ... ...the child. And he explained it to me: "When you didn't believe, you saw me ... ... like a child and now that you think I'm old, and do you know why? - Because? Why? - Because you've become wise. No: because you've gone crazy. I'm on my way out. Don't wait for me for dinner. Order all the patrols to search for José de Arimatea. Do penance, Pilate. The kingdom of heaven is near. - Have you heard the news yet? - Just what we feared has happened. It was José de Arimatea. But I've sent patrols everywhere, they'll find it. - Nerd. - What do you mean not? They won't find it because it 's locked in there. As a precaution we kidnapped him last night ... ... therefore he cannot have been. - Then who was it? Neither did the disciples. Judas has committed suicide. And of the other eleven nothing is known. José is in here. Friend. - Yes Yes. But if it wasn't him, then ... ... who was it? It has disappeared! There are no windows or passageways. Any. The seal was intact. The door was locked from the outside and the key has always been kept by me. - Oh ... - What's wrong? No, nothing: a puncture. In short, the situation is as follows: Joseph of Arimathea has escaped through the walls ... ... while the dead rose from the grave ... ... and was going for a walk on his own. Up to here everything is normal. That seems perfect to me. And in fact we have found it. Who have you found? To the wall-piercer? No, the dead man. Or the dead-alive. And as you say I was going for a walk. - Like one of us. - Step by step. And he was walking on the road to Emmaus. But the funny thing is, it didn't look like him. - It looked like another. - That other? Mystery... Then two disciples approached him and one of them said to him: "Stay with us, Lord, because it is getting dark." And he stayed. And only then did it become known. - Don't tell me who it was. - It was himself, in person. In the flesh. You already said that! Oh my head... And why did the disciples ask him to stay ... ... if they hadn't recognized him? That is another mystery. Yeah right. A mystery within a mystery. And why did they tell him to stay because it was getting dark? Were they going to plot something in the dark? A plot to carry on ... ... under cover of the shadows? Or is this also another mystery? - The mystery of mysteries. - No: this one is easy. Oh, thank goodness. This one is easy. Of course: because when night falls the man is afraid. About what? Do you see the sun setting far in the desert? - And that? - Well ... it's the time when man ... ... is lost. In the power of the unknown. In fact, I also often wonder ... But who am I? - I also. - It's true. Who are we? Ah, I don't know. Who can we ask? We can ask Publio Virgilio Marón: "You are the masters of the world, the robed people, the Romans!" - But I don't recognize you. - Yes, but think about it for a moment, sir. If a living escapes through the walls ... ... then it is also possible that a dead ... ... get out of the grave and go for a walk on your own right? Well no. Not because when I've seen it ... ... the dead man was really dead. He was very dead. Unless, despite appearances ... ...- I am not Aesculapius -... ... these Bedouins, excluding those here present, it is understood ... ... be witches. A magic filter, some powders ... It doesn't take much, right? - We have to find the dead man. - No! We must find the live ... ... because it is the living person who was guarding the dead. And he is the end of the skein. We must find José de Arimatea. We have turned Jerusalem upside down. We have the gates guarded, and nothing. From José de Arimatea on the trail. Why are you laughing? Because you do like the one who was looking for the donkey and was riding it. - Mr jose! - I know you're looking for me. And you were on the donkey. So it was at my house. Dined here. Your mistress has insisted so much ... But now I must go. Forgive me. How did you escape from the cell? Who has opened you? - If I told you, you wouldn't believe it. - Try it anyway. Although I sure don't understand it well either. And what are you doing as a civilian? Have you been licensed? I have been in service for thirty years. It would be time No: I was only accompanying Mr. José. Where are you going to? I asked you a question: How did you manage to escape from the cell? Suddenly... ... the cell was filled with light. And I saw four angels raising the roof. And the sky seemed clear to me, as if it were daytime. Then... ... Jesus held out his hand and flew me home. In other words, I left the cell despite the doors ... ... locked. But I can't figure out how all of this ... - ... could have happened. - And me less. - Well, I do. - I imagine. And before leaving me, Jesus told me: ... I'm going to meet my brothers. - Don't tell me where. - In Galilee. I would have sworn it. But if you have decided to take me to the madhouse ... ... you are all very wrong! And don't yell that my head is exploding. But if you are the one who screams. Consider yourself stopped. And what have I done? I had first thought of charging you with concealment of a corpse. - Now I've changed my mind. - But... I formally accuse you: simulation of death and concealment. Because when you are found by everyone on the way to Galilee ... ... four days by camel from here he is not dead, he is alive! - But no one has said otherwise! - Ahhhh! - Jesus is alive! - You admit it! Yes! But before he was alive he was dead! I understand. Guards! No, you do not understand, Excellency. Dead and buried and on the third day he rose again from the dead ... ... because that is what he had promised and that is what he has delivered! And I have said that I have already understood. Guards! You too? You too, Valeriano? Go away. Outside are the horses. Mount and go quickly to Galilee. - Well! We also have the defector. - We must hurry... ... because the Lord has told Mary of Magdala that still ... ... has not gone to the father. Then it is very clear that you have to hurry. Go away, I'll take care of him. Yes. Go away. Go away. Daos prisa. They are already gone. And now you better kill me right away. Because as you put the gun down ... ... I call the executioner and order him to crucify you. Hopefully. As always, you have not understood anything. So help me understand. It may be better if you don't understand. Would it be useless? Maybe I love you precisely for that. Wow. Goodness. Guards! - Sight! - There is. That's the angel! Now you've seen it too. Do you remember what Jesus said when he was imprisoned? If I had to ask my father for help, he would send me twelve legions of angels. If we take the soldiers of a legion and multiply by twelve ... ... we get a total of eighty thousand nine hundred twelve Marcoantonians ... ... like that one, of which eight thousand seven hundred twelve go on horseback. - But what are you saying? - I'm just looking at that one. - But looking at who? - Don't you see it? - To who? - To the angel. To the angel? Do you see an angel? Well ... we see one. Why? You do not? I have gone blind anyway. Well, what do we do now? Shall we continue? No. They are too far ahead of us. Who knows where they will be. Let's go home. And let's walk away. It will be better. What a pair of beasts ...! ¡Claudia! Agla! Here everyone has disappeared. ¡Claudia! Where are you? - It's no use yelling. - Ah. Esterina! - He's gone. - And where did he go? What does it say? He says that Valeriano has also escaped. - He says they ran away together. - Where to? To Galilee. But what are they all going to do in Galilee? - They follow that Jesus. - Has he also left? Well, it is understood. Apparently he has preached and done miracles in Galilee. The people there love him very much. Instead here in Judea ... ... the priests have chained him. This is a cursed land, Excellency. They say that in Galilee he will found his kingdom. What is he going to do? Yes. But don't worry. Rest assured: he is not the prophet. - The prophet is Moses. - I know, you already told me. Let's go back to Rome, Excellency. This story will end badly. I have a black feeling. Wow, man. It had to happen precisely to me. So sorry for Brutus that in Philippi he met the ghost of Caesar. What should I do? I have to compete with one ... ... that he's not even a ghost. It is not known who he is. What is clear is that he is very smart. "My kingdom is not of this world" and meanwhile slyly ... ... intrigue, corrode, divide ... But what is he going to divide, if he's dead? Well. Let's see where I can find a towel now. ¡Claudia! - So, what can we do now? - You don't know. I am leaving. - And where you're going? - To Galilee. - You too? - Me too, yeah. Why? Is it that I can't go? On the contrary: I am the only one who should do it. Herod Antipas has invited me many times but I have never accepted. He will be a puppet of Rome but he still rules a third of Palestine. He is a tetrarch, a colleague. I'm going to pay him an official visit ... ... and thus I am distracted a bit. They say he has a very cheerful court, ... a woman who is a whore and a niece, Salomé, ... ... who does a dance called the seven veils. - And what is that? - That's what, ... ... while dancing ... ... she drops veil after veil and stands naked. - Ah, the crown. - And you to see a naked woman ... ... are you going to Galilee? They say it's very good. - Yeah, because I make you laugh. - But it's not about that. It's something else ... it's another world. You have not understand? I don't understand huh? But what do you have to do with it? You always have to meddle. Find me a bag to put all these clothes. How do I wear them? What do I care. Oh, my stomach is in my mouth. - Are you feeling bad, Excellency? - No. It's the camel pass. I 'm getting dizzy. I think I'm going to vomit. - Go walk. - Worse, I would fall for it. No, it is precisely the desert that kills me. Why have I come to die here? What wrong have I done? It's as if a one-eyed man had looked at me . Why don't I go home? At least in Rome one is entertained. Nothing, they don't even answer you. Nothing happens here. Everything is like the desert. Identical, same, monotonous. And wherever you look there is nothing, there is no one. Also, this silence drives me crazy. Any. You can't hear anything. No problem. They say that Herod Antipas, as soon as the word has spread ... ... that the crucified was going to Galilee, he has shut himself up in his house ... ... and no longer opens to anyone. And if it doesn't open it to anyone , what are we going to do there? - It got into his head. - Hey, but instead of going to Galilee ... ... why don't we go on and go to Rome? Hey! But do you want to shut them up? With so much cotorreo ... ... you are driving me crazy. You are a lot of charlatans. Blablabla, blablabla, blablabla. - What happens to the tetrarch? - The Nazarene has been seen ... ... around the Lake Tiberias area. Herod Antipas lives in terror. A caravan is approaching. Wow. Just now that I was going through the fourth veil. Salomé: You have made us see it a thousand times. Shut up! Make yourself known. Who are you? We escorted Ponzio Pilatos, the Governor of Palestine. Let me in before I die. Open to the Eagles of Rome. Let us embrace it as it should. Music! But I cannot start from the fourth veil. If you don't dance often, it doesn't work. It has no effect. - Well, it starts from the beginning. - Again? To be interrupted by the first jerk that comes along. Thanks for the compliment. In other times, with a similar reception ... ... the Romans would have sacked the city, ... ... set on fire, dear Tetrarch ... Be patient. Salomé is capricious. She really didn't want to: she 's a girl. Then it is the voice of innocence. - Because I really am an asshole. - How? My wife ran away with a centurion. - Claudia Procula ?! - The same. - I refuse to believe it. - Me too, but that's the way it is. - On the other hand, they are dies. - Heh And you tell me? As a young man I fell in love with Cleopatra. Yes. That was understood with Marco Antonio. He pushed him against Rome, against Octavian. You have no idea what a whore is capable of. But you have a faithful wife. Who? Herodias? No! She is my concubine! Yes, she is the wife of my brother Herod Filippo. She is also an adulteress. - Another whore. - It is that, on the other hand, they are women ... ...you said it. Please... But you, why are you looking for your wife in my kingdom? Why did you come here. But I starting tomorrow ... ... I'm going to search the whole country far and wide ... ... and I'm not going back to Judea until I find them. Right now everyone is coming to Galilee. - Who is everyone? - Well, also that other ... - What's it called? - Who? - The one I sent you and you sent me again. You do not remember? It seems to me, yes. He who says that he has risen - Yes, yes, yes, yes ... I have the name on the tip of my tongue. - Me too, yes, yes. Eh ... what's his name ...? - Esau. - Esau. No. It is not Esau. But it is a similar name. - Jesus. - Jesus! That's it! Bravo !: Jesus. Yes, Jesus. But why? Has he also come to Galilee? Of course not! And to everyone who meets he says: see you in Galilee. - He says ... - Sorry, but in your opinion ... - ... one who has died ... "you say?" - Precisely ... - All that makes me laugh. - Well, come on to me. Laugh, laugh. But while you die of fear. I was not the one who asked for Juan's head : it was my mother. He wanted to see him dead because he reproached him for his adultery. - It's not true: it was him. - And what happens? I am the Tetrarch of Galilee and I command him to cut off his head ... ... who do I think is clear? The Baptist was asked, "Who are you?" And answered: "I am not the Christ." "Are you Elias?" He said no. "So, are you the prophet?" He replied: "I am not the prophet." "But then who the hell are you?" He said: "I am the voice of one who cries out in the desert" And I said: "this is not the answer of a sane" These people are dangerous and I get them out of the way. I also always distrust people I don't understand. Because we are ancient. We have very clear ideas. Do we have them? Now he has locked himself at home for fear of revenge from ... ... the one who comes after the Baptist. But that precedes it because ... ... existed before him. Sorry, but I have not grasped the sense. This is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Shut up, asshole. You will not believe that I am afraid of a sorcerer. The son of an old man and a young girl. People highly criticized ... ... who to escape the opinions of the people fled to Egypt. They fled to Egypt to escape your father's persecution. Again with the story of the Massacre of the Innocents ?! The truth is that when I came to take office in Palestine ... - ... there was still talk of that. - Yes very good. But we could ... ... resize. Because if not here people hear say ... ... the massacre of the innocents and what do you imagine? - A butcher shop. And no! - Oh no? - But do you know how many inhabitants Bethlehem had among men, ... ... women, the elderly and children? - How many? No more than a thousand. And in proportion to that number ... ... how many children would there be, a hundred? Let's eliminate those over two years of age. Because from that age there was no reason to kill them. There are about twenty left. Remove the girls, because the presumed king was a boy. Let's say half and half? There are only ten left. Let's subtract some that managed to escape. Because the truth is that Jesus himself was saved. So how many did my dad cut their throats? Five? Six? Is that a massacre? Maybe she's a scoundrel. Perhaps a crime. But a slaughter, it is exaggeration. Well, sure ... seen like this ... I had never thought about it. The killings are yet to come. My dad's thing was nothing. Then you will find out. They will find out. You have the goodness ... My dad's thing will be nothing. Come on: let's start over. Ah, great. Do you want me to do a little dance for you? Yes, but quickly, I have to get up early tomorrow . And. Beware of the Nazarene. It could come at any moment. - Attentive. - If he comes ... ... we will receive it as it deserves. ¡Bravo! He has fallen asleep! Just now that I was missing a single veil! I can never finish! Ah, cruel fate... But where are we? This is the plain of Esdrelon. We are ten kilometers from Nazareth and a seven or eight day walk from ... ... Cesaria Marítima. - We're going to the mountains. - Because? - What do I know? At least there is something there. There is nothing here. Oh! The camel! How pleasant is the step of the camel! Oh, look how they burn me. Hey? No thanks: I have colitis. Go figure! But look at these morons ... Take it, son, take it. Ay. It's no use pretending you're coming after me. - I know who you're really after. - To who? Valeriano and I have also followed him. And you know it. Don't be fooled, Pilate. Here we are all looking for Jesus. Excellence! Come to see! Friend! Look: there are people at the foot of the mountain. There has to be a hidden meeting. They go on a clandestine date. Let's go,! Hurry up. - Excellency, hurry up! - Calm. - Cheer up! Don't burden me. If you're in a hurry, get out. Let's go! Fast! Fast! Let's go! Let's go! - Come on, cheer up! - Hey! That I already have an age! Hey? It was necessary that everything that is written be fulfilled ... ... in the law of Moses, in the prophets and in the psalms. Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and rise again ... ... from the dead on the third day and that his name ... ... penance and the remission of sins were to be announced ... ... to all people. And you are ... ... the witnesses to these things. And I send over you ... - But ... it's him. - And what did we tell you? - ... go into the world and preach ... - Relax, don't lose your head. - Calm down, don't lose your mind. "What about your wife? Have you seen her?" - Where is? - You will speak new languages ​​... ... you will catch snakes with your hand, and if you have lost ... There they are all: Valeriano, Longinos, José de Arimatea ... Ready to intervene. We'll catch them red-handed. In the act of what? Be still in the name of Rome! - You are all detained. - He followed us. Proceded. "Claudia! Where are you going?" - We are going to announce the kingdom of God. But... Oye:... ... look who has gone there. Poor Pilate, how much darkness. He is blind. "What's wrong? Has everyone left?" - Why didn't you go with them? But have you taken me for a tramp? A bastard? I am a serious person. Come on Luckily you stayed! If not, to see how it returned. No, I am the Governor and then ... Waiting! For! Come here! Come here, little animal! Come! Yes... No, I am the Governor and I have to go back to Jerusalem ... because when I'm absent, of course, those get in ... in every mess that I don't ... I ... What are you laughing at? I laugh because if you talk to me it means that you see me. Ah! Why? You also thought that I am blind. So you saw me the other time too? If you say so, I have seen worse houses. Just now, I've seen your boss flying. What things, huh? Ours fly too. Look at Mercury. You've seen? But they are tricks to impress people. I've already seen it all. And have you believed in what you have seen? - What insistence! - The Lord said to Tomas who doubted: "You have seen and believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and believed" Well, I have seen and I have not believed it. You see: one cannot believe everything. I already have mine you know? of course, that you will say: If you are a polytheist, what do you care about one more god or one less god ... Nerd. You cannot add the Lord to the pagan gods. - What does the writing say? - What does it say? There is no other god besides me. Ah. That says huh ?. Well look, I'll have to read ... - ... that writing one day. - You can't believe everyone. - But I don't believe in anyone! I am from a refined philosophical school: I am a platonist. You can exist or not exist. I do not care to. Are you good for anything? Not at all to me. But Angel: you who have confidence in him, tell your Lord Jesus ... ... that in Galilee he will not create his kingdom ... ... because the Eagles of Rome fly higher ... ... than his angels and higher than any heavenly father. Come on, beautiful! I want to get there before dark. What, are you listless? Well, you have to cheer up, man ... Do you understand, Angel? It will not succeed in dividing the peoples ... that Rome has united and will take the war nowhere ... because here Roman peace reigns. Hey, I got off because I understand what weight. But from there to pulling you or talking. I have a lot to do and they are waiting for me . And there is very little left. Come on, make an effort! Be good, be good! Good good. Well, there you stay. It is useless wasting time with donkeys. Come on, there is little left! ¡Eh! ¡Eh!¡Eh! Romans! ¡Eh! What has happened? Orders of Tiberius, Emperor of the Romans. All Jews living in Jerusalem and surrounding areas ... ... they will be scattered, ... enslaved by other peoples, expelled from Judea ... ... and sent wandering around the world, without peace. But why? They have done? They have forced Ponzio Pilatos to crucify a god named Jesus. - Esterina! - Fortunately you have returned. - What have they done to you? - I've been stabbed by the Romans. It's not possible. You have mistaken. They have punished me because I am Jewish. The Romans kill the Romans ... They say that I was the one who killed the Lord Jesus. How is it possible? Can you imagine it? I am not even capable of killing a fly. And there are many in here. Yes. I have eaten some that was in the soup. He wasn't doing it on purpose. They fell into the pot by themselves. The poor flies are suicidal, you know. But I have never killed anyone. Never. I swear. Are you the so-called Ponzio Pilatos, former governor of Phenicia and Palestine? How "ex"? I am the acting governor. No sir, not anymore. Tiberius has dismissed you. Now the prosecutor is Ventídio Cumano, in whose name I declare you arrested. - Do you recognize me? - Walk! Are you death? Am I that bad? Well, we are not. I am Barabbas. But hadn't he set you free? Yes. But I am a Zealot. So for participation in an armed gang and subversive association ... ... as soon as I left they caught me again immediately. Sorry. I did not know anything. There are too many things you have never known. Palestine is going to burn and you do n't even realize it. Do you know, at least, why the emperor has removed you ... ... and ordered retaliation? If you know, don't keep me in the dark. Tiberius suffers from an ulcer, he has fevers and nine types of leprosy. And am I to blame? Nerd. But they tell him that in these places ... ... there is a doctor who heals lepers only with the word. Then he rushes to Jerusalem. But as soon as he arrives they tell him that the doctor has been crucified for you ... ... under Jewish pressure. - Well... - Not exactly like that, huh? - But that's what they told you. And therefore, in the name of that ... ... who has preached religion ... ... of love and forgiveness, ... ... from today the time of revenge will begin , ... ... and a whole people will be persecuted ... ... forever and ever. - Nice paradox. - But I... I have done my duty. That will not prevent Tiberius from making you follow the same path of the Nazarene. Yes, laugh. No, you cannot understand it. You are a native. Indigenous. But when you first come to a colony ... ... and it comes from the center of the world, from culture ... ... I'm from Sutri, exactly, ... ... says: this is going to be a short time and I'll be right back home. And then time goes by, you find yourself involved ... ... in a kind of lethargy, and you lay flat. - I find you nice. - Thanks. ¡Ahhhhh! - If it hadn't been for you, I would be on Golgotha at this time ... ... in the place of Jesus. Well, it's not that you 're better here , huh? But if I am here again, it is not your fault. So I want to help you. You can offer Tiberius the cure ... ... in exchange for your life. - And who's going to heal him? - The Veronica. Who? Have you never heard of La Verónica? The woman who wiped Jesus' face on his way to Calvary ... ... and was left with the imprint of his face on the cloth? Yes. Only, this lady Veronica ... ...does not exist. It is a misunderstanding. Verónica means "vera icona": ... ... true picture. Here it is. The face of Jesus . I wiped it for him! You place it in front of Tiberius' face ... ... and heals it. And do you believe it? Of course! Because it is an image that can do everything: it is miraculous. But hey, let's see: - Do you believe in miracles? - If you didn't believe in miracles ... ... how revolutionary would he be? Move on! He had managed to find the right doctor , the great thaumaturge ... ... and that one goes and crucifies him! - It's true, but they too ... We have not killed him. Because we by law cannot kill anyone. All have collaborated in the execution of that messenger of truth ... despite the fact that his prophets, as well as our sibyls ... ... warned them not to. And you have not recognized him as king of the Jews. Herod Antipas was already chosen by Rome. We have not recognized it, it is true. But for us he was not the Messiah. Let the prisoner pass by! But what do you do? Do you incline them as at the passing of sovereigns? But if we have not. They have bowed themselves. It's true, Caesar. We have not been. And who was it? Curious! It happens exactly as with the magician. And these wicked priests said, "He has made a spell!" Watch out, Caesar: these are hypocrites. Yes, but then who was it? Do we repeat the entry? So we see if it happens again. Just say: "Forward the prisoner!" Boys: Eagles up! Forward the prisoner! You've seen? Weapons and banners ... ... bow only at the pace of kings. I've already passed through here, and they get up. And since I'm not going to go through here ... up! And who do they greet? To you? You never know. It is always the same: the one whom the priests present here did not want to recognize. To the Nazarene Jesus, whose face I have portrayed. Here is the cloth with which they wiped his face ... and Veronica left us. This is? Just looking at it may make a miracle happen. - How? - Allow me. The leprosy will disappear from your face and you will turn white and red ... ... like an apple. Hold. Well, an apple I don't know ... A prune! But you'll be better than now, huh? I have promised half my empire and the city of Rome ... ... to the one who knows how to free me from this disease. - I renew my promise. - I am satisfied with less. So, I save your life or I grant you whatever else you ask of me. - What you want? - Whatever you want. - Fiancé? - Caesar's word. - Start? - Whenever you want. Jesus! Have you understood who this Jesus was? Honestly, I hadn't realized it. But I am not understood ... I am a Roman. I have another concept. We only believe what we see. Well, if we take a serious look at it. we don't believe in anything. My wife, August César, she did understand. Because women have premonitions. Ah, Valeriano: here. Please be patient and take care of this. But they do not. They have not noticed. They who are the doctors and the priests and know the law ... ... and everything that the prophets have announced , they have not realized. On the contrary. You were so sure that you said: may his blood fall on us ... ... and about our children. And that is what has happened. No: it has fallen only on your children. I have seen them in the street beheaded by the Romans. And you are here, talking. Nothing has fallen on you. As almost always, the blood has fallen only on the people. Enough Pilate. All is well that ends well. And what ended well? I keep the promise that I have made to you in return. - I save your life. - And who asked you? Why? What have you asked me? The pact was life or whatever else I asked you to choose. And what else can you ask me but life? Is there something more precious than life for a man? Everyone else's life. The life of a town, for example. The life of the Jewish people. Are you asking me in exchange for yours? No, not that! No! No! Suspend your pursuit, Caesar. If not you will leave an ugly precedent on history. Do not make a furrow between the peoples. Between the Jews and everyone else. On the other hand, who was Jesus Christ? the Lord our God. But who was he really? He was a man. - And the rest of the data? - I do not know. Who was? You see You have already forgotten. He was a Jew. And who are the apostles? They are other Jews who go around the world to preach the law that ... ... Jesus Christ has completed but has not changed. It's the same. Remember this detail and let's push the matter to its proper limits. In the fifteenth year of your reign, divine Tiberius, ... ... in the fourth year of the twelfth Olympiad, ... ... on the eighth day of the calends of April, ... here in Jerusalem, in the place called Mount Calvary, ... ... has happened what happens in the world every day, ... ... and it will continue to happen forever and ever: an innocent man has been murdered. Here is the culprit of the crime. Do justice, Caesar, and settle the score. You have freed me from the snare of death. And you have promised. He could grant both: the life of Pilate, ... ... and stop the chase. - Can be done? - Well... No, Caesar. Since the world is world, blood wants blood. The culprit has to be punished. That is true, unfortunately. But Tiberius can be forgiving. No. If the account is not settled ... ... the first criminal to pass through history will believe he has the right to ... ... persecute the Jews. Stop future criminals, August Caesar ... ... and proclaims to the world the following: The so-called Ponzio Pilatos is the murderer of Jesus Christ, ... ... the one who, it seems, ... ... is the first born from the dead, ... ... the prince of the kings of the Earth. And as a consequence of this ... he is sentenced to death. Pilate... You have proclaimed our Lord. You have finally understood. So ... you believe. - Do you have a coin? - Huh? A óvolo, a drachma, a sestercio ... - So that? - To die the old-fashioned way. I have to pay for the journey of Charon's boat ... ... to cross the Styx lagoon. But then, you don't believe! That's not the point. Let me die like a Roman. I'm not ready for anything else. It would take a hundred years. Settle the bill, Caesar! Settle the bill. ¡No! Come on! Before I regret it. All generations will call you blessed ... ... because under your mandate things were accomplished ... ... announced by the prophets. And you yourself, as its witness, ... you will appear when I return to judge all those ... ... who have not recognized his name.
