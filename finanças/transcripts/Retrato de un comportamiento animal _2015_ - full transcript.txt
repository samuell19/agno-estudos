Hello, thank you very much. Oh, you saved my life, I've been waiting for hours. Martina, nice to meet you. - But... - Oh! It's so hot! I'm melting. - Listen to me... - I didn't bring any sunscreen... I'm so stupid, I've never hitchhiked in my life... - Sorry... - and I don't bring any sunscreen... Sorry, but I didn't stop to pick you up... - Didn't you? - I stopped to go to the Fruit Stand. Oh... This is the boss's car, if he finds out that I picked up someone... Oh, but how he can find out? Please, I can hide myself in my suitcase... Seriously, if the car was mine, I would... Oh, please... I'll hide in my suitcase... Who's going to find out? Come on! - What? No... - Please... Seriously, I can already be punished for letting you enter to the car. But I'm going to work in my thesis. Look... take this... No, seriously, I'm not joking... there will be no problem, because... I'm a nice person. Get out, put all your stuff back in your purse. Please, I'm asking you to get out... I can't take you with me! But take this for a second! But I'm telling you I can't! Get out! I asked nicely now I'm asking you to get out! - But...! - I told you the car isn't mine! Stop! Don't be rude, you're going to break all my things. Take this for a second, wait a second, I want to show you something... I don't want you to show me anything. You're making me nervous, I want to show you my student's certificate. Please. Get out! Put that back outside the car. I've stopped because I wanted to buy some fruit there. I have to go; I'm in a rush. - Ok, take this... - The car isn't mine, I'll open the door... - Ok! I'm getting out of the car... - ...and you get out. - Wait! - Unless you want me to throw your stuff out. Wait! You wait! the car isn't mine, I'm asking you to get out. Can you hold this? So I can put back in one thing at the time. Thanks. Hand me that... ...because It may brake. I'm a woman. - Give me that. - It's not my fault. I never hitchhiked in my life. This is the first time. Ok, It's not my fault... Give me that. I cannot take you with me, If I could... I don't know why you can't... I've already told you. What do you pretend? That I lose my job? I don't understand what's the problem... Who would find out? It's only 20 kilometres... If this was my car I would take you and your whole family. Damn! Nobody's going to pick me up! They told me it was easy! Someone will pick you up... with that attitude nobody is going to stop for you. No? Thanks. Yes, I've already told you... if the car was mine, I would take you... It's not my fault, the car isn't mine. This shitty car. Well, please get out of the car. Come on... Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out girl! Asshole! "Why humans tend to be hostile? Why is it so hard for man to be good? Not in vain, the famous ethologist Vitus B. Dr√∂scher, said: in the universe of feelings, we are rather below many animals Included in this, unfortunately, the section of love." "Portrait of an Animal Behavior" Take this, I'm sorry, I can't take you with me. But... I brought you some fruit. Well, good luck. Bye. Take off your hand. Asshole! I'll shove the bananas up your ass motherfucker! Do you mind if I make some questions and I record them? Come on. How would you eat an apple? With peel... Suppose we go to dinner and I give you a plate of peas... How would you eat them, with a spoon or with a fork one by one? A hypothetical situation: Imagine someone is going to crucify Jesus or your mother... Who would you save? Ok, imagine you are in Nazi Germany... and you have a bakery... and then Hitler comes in and orders three croissants... Would you sell him the croissants? Yes, we would. So you aren't Jewish? No, not for now... When you take a bath... What do you do first? "Day 2: Here I am, on route 66, This is for you... the one who told me that everyone would stop. It's cold... My feet hurt..." You dropped this, take it. - Thanks. - Poke it! Don't you want to puncture the wheel? Poke it. - No, thanks. - Come on. Poke it. - No, no. - But scratch it, I don't mind... - Poke it. - No, thanks, don't worry. I'm telling you to poke it. Poke it. - No, I don't want to... - Poke it, poke it on the wheel! - I don't want! - Nail it, nail it! Let my hand free! Ouch! Give me the scissors so I can scratch the car. Set me free, you're crazy! Scratch the car! come on... Leave me alone! Scratch it... Help! Help! - Shut up! - I'm in...! Shut up or the BOPE will come! I'm in danger! Shut your mouth! Matto... Martina... So... what did you tell me you do? I'm a marine biologist and... the NGO which was going to support us, decided not to... and now my boss told me I have to go back to Montevideo... and return the car. Oh! That sucks. But I'm already here so I'm going to make this trip. That's why when I saw you I thought we could travel together... ...and split up expenses. If that works for you, cause I don't know if you're going in this direction... I could leave you at the bus station or wherever you want... Ok, that's ok. If it's going to be cheaper to me... ...because I don't have much money. My plan was to hitchhike but... nobody stopped for me. Nobody? Well... yes, some guys stopped for me, but... What are you doing here? Where I want to go is Salvador de Bahia... Why? Do you like "capoeira"? I'm a big fan of a group of musicians that was formed there, in the sixties... the Tropicalia; Have you heard of it? Tropicalia? What's that? - No? - No Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso... Gilberto Gil, Brazil's Minister of Culture. And he's making music nowadays? He has always made music and now he's a politician. And what do they do? They mix Brazilian traditional music with rock. Remember the CD I showed you yesterday? The one you almost broke... No, whom is it from? This one. Who's that old ugly man? Old and ugly? That's it! It's my chance to see a sea turtle. If I see a tiger mollusk I'll be happy too. If everyone that said I was not going to get nowhere near the Chuy could see me now... "How you dare to quit your job Martina?" Are there any fishes?! "Matto always found animals more fascinating than humans. He inherited this from his father. When he was at school, instead of playing with his classmates, he would entertain himself investigating the whole ecosystem that exists beneath a fallen log or... in the depth of a rainwater poodle. He would hunt insects... and label them... all of this because an enormous encyclopedia, his father gave to him, who had also received it from his grandfather... and he had also received it from his great grandfather. Matto believes that man has evolved due to animal wisdom. Every step in human progress has it equal in the animal kingdom. We've invented tools trying to imitate certain animal abilities. We have built all kind of buildings imitating some animal's dens. Matto's dream is to discover a new kind of animal. That's why he always wanted to be a cryptozoologist. Cryptozoology is the study of undiscovered hidden animals. His passion is extends to all animals, no matter how common they are." What are you doing? I'm making a portrait of the animal behavior. I'm not an animal. Leave me! We are all animals. Well I'm a very special one. Behold this unique specimen: the long-neck ostrich... Look at her elegant walking style, her splendid neck, her subtle manners. She shows her teeth and she opens her mouth, making other animals run far away. She plays with her claws and continues her way to her natural habitat. She goes down to the beach where she'll find a male to mate and some animals to hunt. There we see her, vanishing between the horizon. - Another hypothetic scenario... - Yes? You live in Nazi Germany and you are the owner of a bakery... and then Hitler comes in and orders three croissants... - Aha... - Would you sell them to him? Does he pays for it? Sure. Then yes. Aren't you Jewish? Any business man would sell to him. Oh, but a Jewish man would never sell a biscuit to Hitler. You have to sell... especially to Hitler in Nazi Germany. The bakery could become the official bakery of the Third Reich. It's all marketing. All right... When you take a bath... - Aha. - What do you do first? I use the soap... I wash my hair... What are you doing? You're taking notes, show me. Get off. These are travel notes, leave me alone. You've already broke my purse. Now you want to break my notebook? What are you doing?! You'll make me crash. You're nuts. You had crumbs... Disgusting... What are you doing? What happened? Are you OK? I thought you were sleeping... No, but leave that... Leave that on. Martina! Leave it. The light remains on. - Are you afraid of the dark? - No, but this is my tent. Oh, you're afraid of the dark. The first day I can sleep, I can't sleep... Go back to the car. Shhh... Be quiet. Are you going to continue like that? I'm watching you... "During daytime, beavers sleep curled up next to each other, and by night they brush each other's fur... or they sit close together and talk for a while, using special contact sounds, whose tones and shades... can only be an expression of intimacy and love." What is he doing? Why is he looking at me like that? Why is she looking at me like that? What's wrong with her? Why is he so happy? Yesterday she touched me... or was it my fault? Oh no... I touched him last night... Oh no... Martina, what have you done?! My pheromones must have some kind of special power on her... What if he touched me? His score on the "Evil Test" was of 5.5... Oh Martina, you should tell someone that you're with this psycho! I have to say something... quickly... Oh, but he has a nice face... I don't know! Something witty... whatever comes to mind... Now! Yes, but he could be a sexual psychopath! Oh Martina! At any time you could be kidnapped and taken to Bahia! It wouldn't be so bad... Did you know that octopuses sexually reproduce? The male's penis is on the third tentacle, it is called hectocotylus. After mating he loses it, loses the member... He looks like a virgin... Yes. He must be a virgin. After a while it grows back... and the male is ready for the next stage of reproduction... What is he saying?! Yuck! She isn't interested... Did I mess it up? I don't want to hear about octopus's testicles! Everyone should be curious about the reproduction of other animals. What if I kiss him now? To shut his mouth... What if we have to move to another planet and start reproducing animals? Now! We would need to know what to do with the octopus! Come on Martina! Not right now! No! Aaaah Martina you screwed it up! "When two beings love each other... playing is essential for mutual approaching. Kids are right when they say that: "those who fight, love each other" and this is true for any species" Look at the web. Look at the prey the spider has. - Son of a bitch! - What are you doing?! Stop! Do you like being shook like this?! Leave me! It was a bug! - I was saving you! - Do you like being shook like this?! No! What are you doing?! Leave me! I'm going to look for the insect repellant. Martina? Martina?! Martina?! What are you doing Martina? Martina?! Are you OK Martina? Martina? I'm making a cake for grandma. What's the matter with you? Bring me sugar for the cake... Sugar? It's there... Martina?! "Martina is a sleepwalker. Yes, she inherited it from her grandma. It has nothing to do with genetics, no, no... but due to her force of will. She always wanted to be like her grandma. She was her idol. Martina remembers staying at her grandparent's house for the summer. She enjoyed staying awake by night, only to watch her grandma's strange behavior. But, she would never stop her, everyone knows that waking up a sleepwalker is the worst thing you can do. She would just pay attention and watch with curiosity the nightly occurrences of her grandma. One night, she cooked a chocolate cake, entirely asleep. Martina had to try a piece as a courtesy to her, and for fear of her grandma's sleepy wrath. She made a face denoting she liked it, and thought she saw her grandma smile without opening her eyes. Grandma had used salt, instead of sugar; all these slips are forgiven to sleepwalkers. Another night, grandma sewed up a dress. She filled up the dress with rivets, bad stitches, poorly glued buttons, yarn balls. Years later, Martina would be surprised by... finding out the same dress in an important designer's clothing store. Even sleepwalking, her grandma, was very chic. That's how Martina started, trying to imitate her grandma. At night, she would try to walk asleep down the hallway, mimicking the sleepwalker stereotype. Her persistence turned her into a spontaneous sleepwalker." I once saw a French documentary about a kid that killed his parents. What?! Was he incarcelated? Why do you think they'd do that? He was only eight years old. And why does that matter? He killed his parents. Well, yes, but he wasn't aware of what he was doing. The fact that they declared him innocent is absurd. If the boy killed his parents; Why does that matter? A fact is a fact. A sleepwalker is not conscious of what he is doing. Hidden desires are revealed in dreams. The kid, deep inside of him, wanted to kill his parents. First: dreams aren't hidden desires. They are desires or fears; there are resarches of sleepwalkers. It doesn't matter at all! It's absurd that he was declared innocent. A fact is a fact. Justice has to be objective about the fact. If everything were subjective, everyone would say is sleepwalking and would be considered innocent. No, not everyone can blame sleepwalking because there's people who study the sleepwalkers. They monitor the body during a certain period of time and that's how they determine what kind of sleepwalker you are. Because there are different types of sleepwalkers. They studied him... Not everyone can say is sleepwalking. So... I can kill you... They made you to focus and imagine you were swimming with dolphins... Dolphins have telepathic and telekinetic powers. What is telekinetic? They can control things with their minds. They have a very powerful mind. Their brain is as big as ours. They have culture, language and also a family sense. Due to the constant state of meditation that they have while floating all day, dolphins have developed a higher potential, than other animals. Their development of knowledge is improved. - Soon we'll be able to communicate... - ...with dolphins. That's why I want to go and see them, I want to prove this, I want to go and see if I can see them. "Martina asks herself: all the people that's traveling around the world... What are they looking for? Are they looking for something? Or is it a life option? Do they think about the future? Are they happy? Do they live day by day? And the ones who question them... Are they happy? What's their goal on working always at the same place? Which is the meaning of their lives? Do their lives make sense? Do they do what they want? Do they do what they think they want? Or they don't even know what they are doing? They think that life is only that? When someone wants to run away... what's the thing we are running away from? Are we running away from the ones we know? The ones who hit the road... do they enjoy more the little things? Why do people have a job? Why do we earn our salary? If we do it to feed ourselves, can't we do it without having a job? If we work in a job we don't like... we're wasting 3/4 parts of our life, What for? For whom? Wouldn't it be better to live twenty five years intensely and that's it?" - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Hello. Good afternoon. - Can I ask you a question? - You can. - Can I ask you a question? - Yes. Where can I see dolphins? - There are no dolphins in this time of the year. - No? Today the opportunity has passed. The best place to see them is "Saquinhos". There is a hill with a panoramic view. You can see dolphins in November or December. - And today? - Yes, today. - Are there any today? - Yes, by the end of the afternoon. Sometimes, when they find a shoal of fishes they pass by the bay. They always look for the fishes near the shore... so they have more possibilities to catch them in less deeper water. - Is safe there? - Yes, very quiet. But you shouldn't swim near. No? They also told me that... there's some fishermen who use them as fish's shepherds. They throw their fishing nets into the sea and then dolphins come... and chase the fishes until the fishermen catch them. - Ok, and where is that place? - It's 80 kilometres from here. At this moment there aren't dolphins. They work with the fishermen in order to have more opportunities to eat. Dolphins are good friends of fishermen. It isn't dangerous but it's scary. So it isn't dangerous? - Can I go? - Yes, you can. From here to the north... What's the name of the place? Come on! Oh, I don't remember... - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Is that OK? You're welcome! - Thanks! - Cause I had to talk with everyone... - Well... "We all know how important is hygiene in seduction. To be liked by someone you have to smell good and be as clean as possible." "Day 7: we arrived to Pantano. We are in a tiny but very cute house. Matto is taking a shower and I'm here waiting for my turn." "Sweetie: Happy birthday! I send you this picture so you can always carry it with you... I love you, Vale." You look pretty. Thanks. I like your earrings. They are new. They look like a mandala. I bought them here. And that shirt? Do you like it? Does it look good on me? Yes, it fits you. Does it? Don't you think it's too big for me? No, I don't. You shaved yourself. Do you like it? - Really? - Yes... Do you like it? It's a shark's teeth... from a white shark. Yes... What? Nothing... You look odd... but in a good way... Odd? Good? - What? - Nothing... Do you want to go for a walk? Sure... "Also wild pigs kiss each other on the mouth..." "And even bonobos make love looking at each other eyes..." Look! What? A bug... What is it? I caught it at the hill... It's a "heminopter". What? It's a "heminopter". "Hymenopter" But it isn't a "Hymenopter" - How come? - No... - Do you know the meaning of the word: hymenopter? - No... "Hymen" means membrane and "opter" means wings. Look... it doesn't have membranous wings. It's like "helicopter". I don't know what it is. What's this? What? This... The masks? Yes... - What are they? From carnival? - No... from theatre. From theatre? Are you a theatre actress? No. So? I know why you made it. Why? Because of an ex... No. Yes... Was he an actor? No. Is he famous? You don't know him... But did he act in something? Is that my toothbrush? Yes... "Darwin said that birds fall in love with each other; and that other superior animals share passions, affections and similar emotions." Look what I bought for you. "Although it is unnatural, city man walks among the crowds, as if he's walking among the trees of the forest. Consciously, we ignore everyone... pretending they don't exist. You could walk alongside someone who is lying on the street, and not even pay attention." I think it will fit you. "Everyone has their own tribe, the city is not an amorphous mass, is a large network of tribes. All of which are interlinked. Unfortunately, the modern citizen cannot always stay within it's own tribe, he must often go to a strange land, and in order to protect himself from the social pressures to which it is subjected, ignores everything around him." "The Human Zoo" - Bro, bro! - What?! Can I ask you a question?! Where can I see dolphins? Here in the bay? Can you see them here? Today you can't see dolphins because the sea is "ruin". "Ruin"? What? Bad? Not good! No, no. I don't do drugs. - You're going to have fun. - You've to do like this. Do I have to swallow the smoke? Smoke, smoke. Hold it! Don't worry bro! Oh man! It's strong! The best weed in all Brazil! The best "Maconha"... marijuana in all Brazil! Oh man! You're crazy! Dude! There is a girl in here. Is she your girlfriend? - What? - We're just friends. - He wants to know if we are dating. - No... Don't you have a boyfriend? Nice! Where are you going bro? Hey Bro! Are you from here? No, but I've lived here for fifteen years. We live there... on that beach. I come here every afternoon, I dive into the water and talk to the dolphins. A lot of pleasure... Do you mean "pleasure"? Yes, pleasure... "Beach, sun, diving into water, dolphins, girls and cold beer" Matto! What are you doing? What is it? Matto! You were eating a meat pie... Easy! You and that guy drugged me! You made me betray my own principles... What? You wanted to smoke... Calm down... it's ok... Shut up! It's not okay! I haven't eat meat for four years, it's a poor animal's life. It's ok... don't worry! It's not my fault if your parents didn't teach you well... if they didn't tell you that in life you have to have principles... No, my parents couldn't tell me because at that point they were gone... I grew up with my grandparents... I told you already! What? Yes, they weren't there... it's ok... Come on, come! Give me a kiss... Tell me a story. What? Yeah, a bedtime story... Well, I'll tell you a legend... Oh no... I don't like legends... But this legend has all the ingredients: drama, romance, action, adventure... it's a psychologic thriller... OK... tell me... Well, you'll be with your eyes closed? Yes... I want you to tell me a bedtime story... "The most dreaded, horrible, awful creature for the Amazonian tribes is the Guariara, the god of the rivers and the seas, the great protector of fishes... Martina? Are you asleep Martina? "Matto wanted to see dolphins but the wind from the south didn't let him. You can never see them if the sea is brave. Luckily Martina was with him, otherwise the disappointment would have been unbearable." "With divine tenderness, also comes the impulses of infernal possessiveness. There's a well known case of a female grizzly bear, who'd slept with her paw, resting on her male's shoulder; and when another female approached, a growl was enough to make her back off." Delicious! Yummy! What happened?! Where are you going?! I'm pissing...! Matto! What's up?! Hi... How are you? What's up? Long time no see you! Everything's Ok. You? - Fine. - What are you doing here? Oh! You brought the whole breakfast! What's this?! Do you want something? A little bit of guarana? - No, thanks! - I have grapes, mango... - No, I really don't. - Banana? No, I have to lose weight, I look like a cow... - Guarana? - No, no, really. - Cookies? - No, I'm telling you I'm on diet... I went for a walk to make some excersise. What are you doing here? Well, I took my exams... and then I came to my aunt's house to rest, to relax and go to the beach. Oh... your aunt...? - "Sara" - Sara! - Yes, Sara. - Is she OK? Yes... - Send greetings to her! - Ok, I'll send them, she always remembers you... - Yes? - Yes. -You're changed! You shaved your beard! Yes, a little... You are skinnier! Are you making exercises? I'm running a little... It's nice to see you! It's been a long time without seeing you. - Yes, it's been... - And to find you here! Did you see the dolphins? - I haven't seen them yet... - No? Tomorrow... They said you could see them here... Sometimes... The other day they appeared, but they were so far away I couldn't see them. Who are you with? I'm with... a friend that... went for a walk... Do I know her? - Do I know her? - Eh? - She's from our group of friends? - No, no... What are you going to do tonight? Eh? What are you going to do tonight? Eh... I think I'm going to stay in the house we're renting. I'm not in the mood to do something... C'mon! Lets go out for dinner! Let me ask my friend and... But the three of us could go... it's on me! - Lets meet tonight! - Ok... Bye! Bye! The water was great. - Wasn't a bit cold? - Eh? No, it was great. Did you run into someone you know? Yes... a friend from college. She invited me to do something tonight... maybe we could go to one of the restaurants on the shore. If you want to... We'll see... Is the water nice? Lets go! Lets go! I don't want to. C'mon. Lets go! Good night girl, may I help you with something? No, thanks. We have bikinis in all colors and sizes. Let see... This is very nice for you... We've all sizes. We've shorts for your lover boy! Look, this is very nice! Do you have a boyfriend? We also have "pareos". We have hats, we have Brazil's flag! Look, for you. This is to give you color. We've necklaces... - You can try them... - No, no, thanks. Don't worry. - Are you on holidays? - Yes, I am. - What do you do for a living? - I'm a pharmaceutical chemist. You are from Uruguay, aren't you? Yes, and you aren't from here either. Goodnight girls, how are you? You can take a look. We have hats, bikinis... Oh my friend! What a pig! I don't know what's happening to her, it's like she's having some sort of attack. You can try anything you like. Mmm... you know I've seen this necklace.. - How much does it costs? - 15 "reales", very nice. I didn't bring my wallet. Oh my friend, can you borrow me some money please? Because I love it and I didn't bring any money. Thanks a lot, you don't know how grateful I am. I love it and it combines with my green dress. Do you want me to wrap it as a present? No, no, thank you very much. Well, we leave it this way, don't you think so? Well, bye bye... Goodbye, thank you. Do you want something else? A short? A...? C'mon eat something. Do you like fish Martina? Ouch! Don't put lemon in here! No, no, no. Put a lot in here because I love it. But it's not as good as your aunt's "paella", Sara's "paella". Do you remember how we used to eat until we were about to explode? Yummy! How did she cook the shellfish? The shrimps! Like chipped with breadcrumbs, rye, honey... What else? - I think she also put a little bit of soy sauce. - And coconut milk? Did she add that too? Yummy! She had a secret ingredient she never told me. She never gave me the recipe. She was something! She was a bit crazy though, you should visit her. She is always asking about you. Besides, if she sees you now, all changed... I always wanted you to shave the beard. - Do you like it? - Yes - Really? - I love it! It looks great! And what's up with you two? We're travelling around... We went to Armacao, We only missed... what's the name? Ilha? Campeche Island. Campeche Island. It's beautiful, it's a paradise, you have to go there Matto. There are certain animals that steal your food. You have to be careful. You can't leave... They are monkeys! No, they aren't monkeys They are something else... Could it be "coaties"? Yes, "coaties". Do "coaties" exist? SURE they exist! You have to go Matto. Yes, we will. And what do you do for a living? I'm a pharmaceutical chemist. And you? I'm studying architecture. Oh, do you? - And you are about to graduate? - No No? - But how old are you? - I've done one year... I'm twenty-four. Do you work or what? I quit my job so I could do this trip. Wow! That's adventurous! To quit just like that without having studies or anything... However, It's great. Well, good luck. I need to go to the bathroom. I'll go with you. - Eh? - Yes... I don't feel very good. What are you talking about? Stay and when I come back you go. - Ok... - Stay. Listen to me! I don't know what kind of shit you've got in your brain! I don't care for the sluts Matto is hanging with! - Let me go. - We are no longer together! Let my hand free you asshole or I'll scream... You're sick... you're mentally ill, you've been following me. What's the matter with you?! - Give me the necklace, it's mine. - This necklace is mine. - Give me that necklace, is mine, I paid for it! - I'm not going to give it to you. Give it to me, I paid for it! Give it to me cause you're going to break it. Give me the necklace! Let me! Give it to me! Give me the necklace! I'm telling you, give me the necklace! Please, let my finger go. Hey! What's happening here?! Look... Are you OK? Yes. Sure? So?! So?! I don't know, I have no idea. And what are we going to do? I don't know, we have to take it somewhere. Look on the map. - Come on. - Ok! Turn it. Give me. Turn it. We are here... "Armacao" Well, it must be two kilometres from here, I'll walk. No, no. Wait, I'm not going to stay alone here on the road. What do you want to do? I don't know but I'm not staying here alone. Well, what do you want to do?! You go? Someone has to stay in the car! I'll go. Don't be rude! Take this and put it away. Don't break the map! Put it away! Hi... Joaquin? It's me... Are you there? Well... nothing... I called to say hello... to tell you I'm still on the road... I send you a big kiss... bye...

I think about you all the time... I miss you. Bye... - Good morning! - Good morning! How can I get a tow to bring a broken car from the road? You have to walk by this street, where you'll find a garage with a mechanic that is going to serve you well. How many streets from here? You have to take the second street and turn right. Great! Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Thank you very much. Bye. So? What did she say? Matto! Let's go to the beach or something. You must be happy deep inside you, confess it. Happy? Why? Because you knew me on the road. Do you think so? Say it! Even if it's not true. What do you want me to say? "I'm happy!" I'm happy. Me too. Me too. We are happy. We are happy. And now that we are happy... what should we do? We wait for the car's parts. Right... And if we bury ourselves? Was this useful for what? To exercise the muscles of your face. What would happen if the tide rises? It would drown us. I have to go back. Go back to where? To Montevideo. Eh? Yes. But... why? I don't understand. Sorry, you had a mosquito. Why? Because today I talked with my mom... and I asked her for money to fix the car... and she told me that my boss had been asking for me. He called the police. Why? What have you done? Vehicle theft. Did you steal the car? I'm with their car. Well! But tell me, I don't understand. I don't understand anything. What are you talking about? What's that you don't understand? I have their car and... Well, but haven't they given it to you for the job? But there isn't job since they cancelled the funds, and I should have returned the car. They have the right to... Well but... you're already here and you've continued with the investigation. Yes, but... without their consent, I have to return the car. Well, but... Tomorrow when it's ready I'll go back to Montevideo. I don't understand. What about the dolphins? What about our trip to Bahia? Are you serious? Yes! I could go to jail and you talk about some trip to Bahia. But why didn't you tell me? We'd been all day long talking about nothing. Because I didn't want to talk about it! Don't bother me! Why don't you become a little more aware of the situation? You tell me not to bother you? We were planning to go to Bahia for a long time. You should have told me today. Enough Martina! You have a mosquito. It no longer matters how amazing everything is here and in Bahia, I'm already disgusted and I want to go back. Disgusted of what? Of me too? I didn't say that. You said that you're disgusted of everything. I didn't say that. You suggested it. What did I suggested?! What do you want from me?! You said "I'm disgusted of everything and I wanted to go"! Do you want to go?! No! I have to go! Don't you listen? Don't you understand shit?! Think a little about me and stop thinking about you! Fuck you... Fuck you! If you want a driver ask the "actor"! What are you doing?! You had a mosquitoe... What did you say? That if you want a driver call anyone else! What does that matter? You are talking nonsense. So I talk nonsense?! What does "the actor" have to do with this? His name is Joaquin. He has to do with everything... I can't believe you didn't tell me something before. Shut up your mouth cause you're driving me crazy! Fuck you... Fuck you stupid! - Fuck off! What are you doing?! - Nothing... "That night... Martina had a nightmare. She didn't really know if it was a nightmare or if she was awake. She woke up in the middle of the night. She wanted to move but she couldn't. She wanted to talk but she couldn't. She wanted Matto to wake up and help her but he remained sleeping. She had to remain still and try to sleep." "Later... Matto also woke up. He wanted to say something to Martina but he didn't want to wake her up. He took the recorder and he locked himself up in the bathroom." Well... I wanted to say that... I love you... That... I'm sorry... That's it. Bye. "I leave you my lucky tiara, so you can see dolphins. I love you! Martina." "Chap, don't go out and get wet. City dressed in rain... put on your boots. Days that inspire art, on her neck, a necklace of raindrops. Falling water, hammering floor. Adventure becomes slippery, not only the sky cries, but also the tile. Fallen arms chap, your languid despair. Is not gravity who made them fall neither you wanting to be rain... It's the absence of a hug. Walking without music; think about her... two, three raindrops. Hear without thinking the incessant singing of rain. Chap... when the adventure is great and corner is surprise... don't care about getting soak."
