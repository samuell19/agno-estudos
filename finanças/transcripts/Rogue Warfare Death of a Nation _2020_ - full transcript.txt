They consider their respective countries to be the best of the best. What I am asking of you now is a challenge for you. This mission is strictly confidential. Nobody should know who you are and what we are up to. We're in this fight together, understand? We are not soldiers! Look around! Do you think they wouldn't do this to you? The plans will soon be put into action! The war is coming! Hold together! And do your job. Roger that? Yes, sir. Very good. Let's get it over with. Fuck! Man met! Forward! Man met. Let's go! Don't you understand? This is war! Go on! Just straight ahead! Over that hill! Are you sure? I've been away for two months and you're already doubting me? No, but we're in nowhere because you had a clue. The whole mission is based on a goddamn hunch. - Relax yourself! - I will not! This is my mission! My Team! Wake up finally! - What's the matter with that? - Let's not get upset. Visual contact! Here! Where are you, son of a bitch Ralph? James? People? People! Where are you? Visual contact! Spread out! Create distance between you! Roger that! - Hey, where are you? - Nearby. Can you hear me? Just over the hill. Stop! We have to stop them! Commander Brisco, please come sir! I think I lost her. Commander Brisco! Hello? Can you hear me? Does anyone hear me? Daniel! I'm waiting! Come out! Fuck! Commander! Two of our men are dead! Two men, sir! Hold on! Does anyone hear me? I repeat: does anyone hear me? The men Jacques and Xu! Both are dead here! You are a fighter, Daniel! I've always appreciated that about you. Show yourself! Come on! Come out of your shadow! Daniel! I'm here okay Look at me! Hold on! Do you hear me? Hold on! Fuck! Crap! Too late. You are our guide... You got me a little... Save your strength! I'll have it in a moment. Hold on, hold on! Fuck! - You can't save us! - Listen, I'll get you out of here. I save you, understand? You wanted to kill me, Daniel? Here I am! - I have been waiting for you. - Do not go! Don't go away, brother! I have to finish this. Gun down! Do you feel that too? The walls around you are collapsing! I stand here! I'm here! You all alone, Daniel! Your team is dead! Your mission has failed. But now you're still getting to your destination. Finally shoot! Finish it! Corpses are already piling up around you. Is my life worth your life Do you see? I am more than just a person! More than meat! I am an idea! And you can't kill an idea! Do you understand now, Daniel? Fuck. On three... Good morning, I'm Molly Turner. I am reporting live the latest news from this still unknown place here in the Middle East. Various sources indicate that the United States is planning an undercover operation. And that in this desert behind me. Details of this joint operation are top secret, but we know the United States have formed a special group together with Russia, China, France and Great Britain, to smash a new terrorist organization. This information was just as surprising to us, as well as for you, dear viewers. We also know that an American soldier who was recently kidnapped is free again. Details of the exemption are not yet known, but we are working hard to bring you information. Our leaders currently seem to be putting all current political crises aside, to fight together. As a unit. For all nations in this world. We will report as soon as we have new information. I am Molly Turner. And we're out. - Good work. - Thank you. What are you guys doing out there now? Put it on the table. The detonator. Secure it under the table. ACTIVATION PROTOCOL - Finished? Let's go. - Let's go! Forward! You look like shit. - How are you doing today, buddy? - Shit. I can't sleep and have to stay in bed for a few more days. Why so long? The hand is infected and I shouldn't exert myself. And your leg They did tests. The knife went through smoothly. Nothing serious I guess. Crap! Thank you. - I love you brother. - Me too, brother. - Thanks for the rescue. - At any time. Ladies, should I leave the room? Fuck you. Daniel, you shouldn't be walking around yet. The five minutes won't kill me. I also want to get out of this hellhole. How you mean. How are you daniel You are the twelfth person to ask me that. So apparently good again. In any case, I don't feel like using the reserve bank. Take it easy! Time to talk about our next surgery. Daniel, are you participating too? - How are you? - He's fine. I have understood. He's probably asked that by everyone. I am fine. Thank you, Jacques. We are just happy that you are back. Many thanks. These photos were found after your rescue mission. These tunnels are very special. In the individual photos you can see that the rocks of the tunnel walls are different. Our experts are currently researching their origins. Sir how are you going to do this? Our analysts can consult a database. - We should know the region soon. - That is good news. Not quite. We still don't know what they're up to. Daniel, I was hoping you could help us with this. You know your way around radiological weapons. Knowing? How many people do you know who successfully defused one? Their leader talked a lot about loyalty; he would use explosives to make himself heard. As far as I know, they are developing compact, powerful bombs that have a much larger impact. - Jesus. - Let's assume, that he made several radiological bombs. Making a statement is the ultimate goal for him. - What is he up to? - He wants to be an idea. - Are you ready? - Yes. Well. You will find the clues in the photos I left there and fall straight into my trap. An aid package. Especially for you. - How much time do we have left? - Not much. Roger that. Say “Hello” to my new friends! Scarface! Al Pacino? Got it! We all know the movie. - You two are humorless. - Get out of here! - And? What about daniel? - He wants to get back on the team. - Why not? - He's not ready. He will not accept a no. - My leader. - What's happening? - What's your decision? - Yes. I've created a destination list. Well. Get ready in 36 hours. The world will be a different place. Yes it will. - How is it looking? - We still have three possible locations. - And the origin? - I'm working on it, sir. Keep going! Wait! It needs to load just right. Watch me do this. Not so. But so. Not so. But so! Calm and careful. Do you see? Lock it up. Load them in the truck. But carefully. What are you working on? These little beauties are my fulfillment! Fulfillment? Yes. Have you ever "Who will be a million..." No, no offense. Each of these bad guys has a fuse. Right behind the pin! Do you know how a grenade works? - Okay. I'm trying to cut the fuse. The typical grenade has a lifespan of around five to seven seconds. I want to shorten it. For two to three seconds. What if it falls off? Bad luck. Dumbass. What are you saying? You are crazy! You also! - How are you today? - Not bad. I was with the team. That was good. Let me see Looks like it's healing very well. So i can go Wait another day! It was seriously infected. You have been through a lot. I know what I've been through But your mind is what worries me the most. It is... I just can't find peace when he's still out there. I understand that. But that's important. Take other people's words to heart! Thank you. - How is it looking? - Still nothing found. There are now only three locations left. But the pictures are still too similar. I see what you mean - Damn it. - Yes. - I keep searching. - Let me know, will you? - Galina? - Commander! Did she boss you around again? Don't start with that! - Do you have anything? - Nothing yet, sir. Then we only have one last option. Hey Galina. Finally someone who appreciates this. Here, take a look at this. You know how grenades work, don't you? Yes. So I take the fuse... and carefully make some small changes. - So that it explodes faster! - Damn it, Xu! I sit here for hours and spend my time... You have to stay tuned. It's good! War room people! In ten minutes. I'll make it short. We have problems figuring out which of the three positions might be the right one. We're running out of time, so I suggest you split up. - Who with whom? - Galina, Ralph, Xu. You go together. James and Jacques. You too! Daniel? - I'll stay here with you. - Very good. There are sure to be more missions. Get ready for anything. - We go at sunrise. - Yes, sir! I drive. - Okay. - Have a bad orientation. Oh god help us. We are on our way! Stay on the line! It should be up there! There is nothing here! Nobody has been here for years. Attention! There could be something here. I do not like it. Stay cool! We're just looking around here. Ok here! It must be here! Are you sure? I do not know. Are we lost? I think you are right. That was probably nothing, man. Let's go! You shouldn't be here. - What does he say? - You shouldn't be here! - No idea. - Get out of this place now. Do you speak English? Go! Leave this place now! I do not understand. Go! Leave this place! Let go! Calm, yes? Hey Chill out! We just want to look around here. May we? You all come! We are not... fight. OK. We don't want to harm you. We just want to look around. The tunnel must be here somewhere. Let's keep looking. There! Holy shit! Only one person in there sells something. What are you doing there? Take it easy. You have beautiful goods. - We do not have much time. - I just want to look around. Do you have something? He must have lived in the tent for a long time. The tunnel collapsed. Otherwise there is nothing here. Okay let's go We're leaving, okay? Thank you. Do you speak arabic? A little bit. I picked it up somewhere. Impressive. They were just scared. Yes, but not only that. Nice people. I wouldn't say nice. They have nothing but the fierce war around them. That's sad. - James, we're going back to base! - Roger that! We come! - How was it? - Except for those villagers... They weren't very happy with us. - And with you? - Nothing! Nobody has been out there for years. - Total waste of time. - Was reported to me. One location still remains. It has to be. My leader. The next few days will be crucial in our struggle for peace. Faith and Loyalty. A reason to fight and die for. Yes. We're on the last legs. Now everything is coming together. The West understands WHAT we are capable of. At last. I want his respect, on and off the battlefield. 16 years of war. Who now expects the enemy to lay down his weapons, and don't want to fight is a fool. As you predicted. It would be foolish to think they won the fight. After our mission the peoples of this land will be get up and fight. You are taking back what is ours! All the soldiers in the world couldn't stop us. You can see victory on the horizon. Have you checked the gas connections and detonators? Yes. Everything is slowly coming together. I will prepare everything for you. And the explosion will be huge. In a few days the world will wake up. - In a new reality. - Well. The first tests in the village failed, but after the new knowledge about the explosions you will not be disappointed this time. We can't make mistakes. We're too close to victory. The trucks are being loaded. Give us the target list and nothing will stand in the way of a successful mission. You should get the list. We erase them! We're going to bleed the world to death and the effects on it nobody can ignore it. - Excellent. - It will be a warning for them! And then the balance of a new world will come towards us. Report it to the soldiers! The time of war is almost up. We stand by them. Until the end, my guide. A quiet peace is on the horizon. Gentlemen! There was nothing in the two tunnels. I know what you are thinking. We have to stay aggressive. We'll get them soon! - I see that too. - The third tunnel. - I want a quick operation there. - Do we need to know anything else? - No, not so far. - Fast. In and out. Just like that. Go in! Find! Eliminate! - sir! - Dismiss! - Will this ever end? - They're like a nest full of ants. The more you kill, the more come after. We have a mission to complete. There it is! We'll kill them all and leave! Up there! It has to be! There! That's it! - The satellites are pointing at the mountains. - Roger that. We're approaching the tunnel, sir. We're almost there. The exit is up ahead. Take a look at that! Hey be quiet Otherwise we will be trapped. Okay let's go! Move out! Something is wrong here. Yes, I agree. Nobody is here. Did we miss it? Seems so. This is the wrong place. Everything Daniel said: the sarin, his army, his plan. - That makes no sense. - What do we do now? We have to be very sure. Do you really think a giant army is about to jump out from behind the rocks? - That is not the point! - They must have left something behind. Let's go! - are you there? - You're approaching. I hate waiting, I hate waiting, I... Tents. Always these shitty tents. On your mark. Secured! Take a look at that! Welcome! You and your cronies have been misled. This war is far from over. Again the war will begin to rage on both sides. Which side are you on? This land was once the cradle of mankind the center of humanity, and you trample on this earth as if it were nothing! These countries have been exposed to war for thousands of years. And became a death zone for your capitalist ideas! I assure you: our time has come. We will get up and take back our territories. Ralph, this is his final declaration of war. Otherwise there is nothing here. Second. What do you have? Out! God! The guy really pisses me off! I'm gonna kill that bastard! It's over! Let's go! Come on! Maybe we're being bugged. Commander, do you hear me? - Yes. - That was a trap! He knew in advance that we were coming. Another trap? He is always ahead of us. We are fine. So I'm not fine. He said something about a "dead zone... You mean that means something? I dont know. I can only find out with a computer. We should all get out of here quickly. Let's go! We are getting closer to the goal. Three more minutes. - Are you okay? - Everything okay. Hey What is her - A trap has been set for us. - Galina! Go to the doctor! You need medical assistance. I don't have time for medicine! He's playing with us! - Whatever he's up to, happens now. - I want you to see a doctor first. - But I have to... - I see. But you need to be examined first! Then you can do what you want. Come on! Fine Take it easy. Man! It only has one goal. - If she wants something, nothing can stop her. - She is Russian. - And? - Yes, sir. Just small scratches. They really meant it. We are in the shooting line. Don't make mistakes! Our people have confirmed it: your trap has snapped shut. - are you dead? - We don't have any evidence yet. Then find out. I want you dead! Yes, Supreme Leader! Go now. Do you have files on the death zone? A list of old base camps left behind after the war? Let me see. There aren't many. Most of the camps will be destroyed as soon as we leave them. But not all of them. Do you see? This is a folder that someone has called the "death zone". Why should you leave an old warehouse behind? Money. It costs more to tear it down than to leave it. It was probably not the most pleasant place because everyone was leaving the building in a hurry. We no longer have a lot of data from the warehouse. - That's perfect. - That's what? Perfect for hiding. Right under our noses. I want everything to be ready as soon as we get our orders. My leader! - Are we ready? - Yeah, this way. Do you have anything? - The death zone. - A zone during the war. It's not just that. It's the name of a camp that was still active during the war. They use them as a base of operations. - How do you know? - He mentioned it once in the video. If he really settled there it would be very condescending and arrogant. He would be right under our noses just because he can. - Show me! - In the middle of nowhere. A lot of space. Who thinks of looking in their own backyard? - The perfect place to hide. - Certainly? Sir, it's supposed to be there. I am sure. Marina, send a camera over this area. Monitoring it is not going to help us. He is always a step ahead of us. Time to turn the tables. We have to go there immediately! No, we can't keep wandering the desert hoping to find something. - Sir... - I believe you but i want to see it again I need Jacques and Xu! Yes, sir. The commander wants to see you both. Now! Great. What have I done wrong again now? - So what's going on? - It's good that you are here. Galina just found an old base of operations. - You will examine them. - What do you mean investigate? Exactly! Go there and get an impression. - Roger that. - Perfect. Yes, sir. Let's go! We're right at the location. It's over there! We should be able to see them in a moment. Remember: calm down! Visual contact! Galina was right. - Good work. - Thank you. Did you find anything? - Is the drone already active? - Come on, sir. This is not possible! Let's go! These boxes are loaded into the trucks. He'll be leaving soon. - How was it out there? - hot. - Damn hot! - You're in a hurry. And drive soon! Galina was right. The guys don't hesitate long. My leader! We are ready. Well. The list has been processed. The men have their orders. The trucks leave the base tomorrow at sunset and are on the way. Excellent. My leader. I remember the beginning of our mission very often. We have come this far together. Two soldiers lie in the sand and die. Both with the scars of war. Together we found the courage to rebel against everything that has been forced upon our peoples. The others have had way too long Giving orders, robbing us and destroying our culture! Yes, the west will never understand our world. They see us as a group of terrorists. You can't see behind the masks. They don't realize that two soldiers are serving their country. Two fathers... who have lost their wives and children. You look at us and see a group of men in masks. With a gun in hand. History will never weigh us. No, but history has a place for those who stand up and fight for their rights. Whatever it costs them. No matter what the reason. You've always been loyal about that. From beginning to. You have led us strongly. No matter how the next fights develop, You know our attitude. You know what we're going to fight for. We stand by you. Until the end. The final step will be broadcast live. How? Live? Yes, I want people to see it in all countries. But the team, they will... We are almost on the last legs of the war. The team can't stop us. One last step. Our peoples need to understand the work being done. You will hear and see what we have accomplished. Your words will give them strength. You will fight without fear. Like us. This mission taught me a lot. Above all, to resist. You rebelled! From the forgotten depths of our desert. They formed a coalition and your ideas have met with approval in these countries. Our peoples owe you. - For your guidance! - Fault? That's not what I want to trigger. Our peoples need an idea. A reason! And they need a loud voice. A sword! A sword, your gift and sharpened with your blood. Without your leadership, these countries would be lost. And groups of soldiers scattered all over the country. Without a chance to fight back. They gave them this chance and the faith back. If you see them now, then they stand together. Behind a mask. And for an idea. Don't believe in me! Believe in an idea! She is much stronger than a man with a gun. - Or a country with its military. - Yes, we believe in you. We are all soldiers. And fight together at the end of the day. We stand by you. Until the end. Right now the team is looking for us. You give everything for this war. But without true conviction, they won't be able to conquer us. It will be too late. Your mission becomes a total failure. We have come too far to make wrong assumptions. We will not accept failure either. They can come but they hit more firearms than you could ever have imagined. I want soldiers around the base. Around the clock. Yes my Leader. Well. Now the sun is going down, my friend. It's a beautiful sunset. - As a matter of fact. - Perhaps our idea will soon be understood. Yes, soon, guide, soon. - Get the men! - Yes. I want to address our countries one last time. And finish what we started We look forward to your presence, Supreme Leader. No mistakes! This war ends now. Naturally. - Are you okay? - All right. Ready to go, sir. To your team! We are ready. It starts at sunrise. Do you have so many disturbances too? There is a lot of traffic here. - It'll go live in a minute. - Get Commander Brisco! Ready? - Smith? - Sir? - What's happening? - You'll want to see that. LIVE BROADCAST - Get the team here! - Yes, sir. What's this? LIVE STREAM ONLINE He can be seen live on the net soon. Show it! Western world! I say this out of my belief and deepest conviction, that we want to bring balance to the world. You have taken our wealth our men and our oil. Soon you will understand what I am fighting for. It's over now! We have to end it for good. If we don't do this, everything will be for nothing. The world is watching us. You know what's at stake. Be aware that we are going to make sacrifices. Who is there? - There. - Me too! I'm there too. Me too. You can't do it without me anyway. Count me in. Well. To the preparations. Commander Brisco? Yes, I want to speak to the president. We're moving out at any moment. That is good news. He's coming right away. Commander, there I am. Yes, sir. Do you have any news? All indications point to an old base of operations, which was abandoned in the death zone after the war. The dead zone? The old warehouse was never demolished and is now used by them as a base of operations. Right under our noses. The tunnels should only distract us. What about the sarin bombs? I know he has some. Then secure the site so that nothing is stolen. I'm sure my men can handle the situation, sir. - Failure is not an option, Commander. - We won't. Well. I'm sending Predator drones across the site and if something gets out of hand we put some missiles on him. Sir, my men will be down there. I understand that. My decision, and I'll have to live with it. The lives of the few for the lives of the many, but... let's hope it doesn't come to that. We make it. Yes I hope. Get to work! Yes, sir! NO SIGNAL Let's finish it! I'm just sharpening it. Thank you. - How is it looking? - We are ready, sir. I don't have to tell you what's at stake. Many lives are in danger if we get the bombs. Got it, it's all or nothing. Hurry up and finish it! Understood sir. A few more hours until sunrise. Good luck! - sir! - Resign! We'll reach the goal in a moment. Happy hunting! Back there! North northeast. That's it! Okay, we have to go! Arms ready. Be quick and accurate and don't waste any shots! You're just the same again! The satellite images show high activity. We'll have lots of company in a moment. - Well then go! - Okay. Forward, forward! There's a lot going on there! How is it looking? A guard hut at the entrance. You have towers on every corner. Silent penetration will be difficult. We need someone in there. Xu, you do that! Roger that. I am at the base. You have a free run. - How is it looking? - Well, you're in position! Satellite image stable. - drone status? - A few minutes. The weapon system will be activated when she is there. - Let's keep the plan in hand. - Understood, sir. A guard moves to the other side. You have a free run. Xu, on my command. Three, two one. Okay, now go on! Go to the main entrance! He's in. I hope it works. - Yes it will. - Guard on tower two. Tower two secured. Xu, go to the hut and give us some cover! As soon as the way is clear, it starts! Jacques, you go with me! - Roger that. - Cover the wall! Ralph, James, we're going through the main entrance. Daniel, can you do it too? Forward! Well then go! Why are you coming so late Main entrance secured. Come in! Xu, find the bomb! We are on the tower! Jacques, keep an eye on the main gate! Be ready! There are dozens of guards here. Eliminate one at a time. Nothing may be smuggled out. Galina, get ready! Don't fire yet! I'm waiting. Shit, the van is pulling up. Xu, what's your status? Xu do you hear me? Your status! I see the bombs in front of me! They have not yet been activated. But they will be shipped soon. Xu! You! What are you doing here? You are here! I want them to go away. I want her dead! And don't disappoint me! Crap! There he is! Up there! Grab it! We have company! Open fire! Come on afterwards. Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! Daniel, we have to move forward! Daniel! What is? Come to you! Hey hey Daniel! Now get up! And kill the pigs! We're screwed! That was a fucking idea! OK? - You can do it! - Daniel, we have to go! Cover me! I'm going in! - Galina, buy me some time! - I'll try it! There are too many! - Merci! - Come on, to the bomb! Shoot the way! Jacques, come on, to the bomb! - I have it! - Can you defuse it? I'm already doing it! OK! Okay, red, blue. Forward! - She's defused! - Let's go! Good job, good job! Come on! - hold fire! And off! - Is that it ?! Are we done We come to you now! Do not shoot! It's me! Xu! Xu, what's the fuck, man ?! Take off the mask! - Let's get out of here! - We come! - I am behind you! - Come on! Further! They are up there! Attention! No ammo! Change! Stop the truck! Come on! We have to stop him! - Blow up the gate! - I'll try it. Roger! Running! My guide, you have to get off the base. My leader! My leader! We have to get out of here quickly! Without you there is no mission. Let's go! There he is! Cover me! Kill her! Go Go go! Crap! Kill her! I assure you that we will not fail. See you soon my friend. Further! Cover me! Met someone All good? - Nothing happens! - He is not here. Daniel! He's in the lab. Roger that! - Finish it now! - Yes, sir! - All right. - Can you do it? Come on! I said, Daniel: Either way! It all ends the way I want it to! - It's not over. - You still don't get it. Ideas are much stronger than any bomb or war! It doesn't matter if I win today or you. Tomorrow someone will pick up where I left off. What if I stop you today and don't care tomorrow? Stop them! I will! Go on! Forward! You can't be everywhere! Was that close enough? I miss our conversations. We're not all that different. We feel obliged to our homeland, -have both lost someone. - I am not like you! - Further! - Follow me! You have your dignity, I have mine. You have your loyalty, I have mine You have your mission. And I have mine You are weak. And went crazy! Throw them away! The rifle too! Stand up! You seem to be in this situation a lot. - Only with you. - Daniel, I'm touched. Stand up! Run! Come! Hurry up! Do you hear the? Your team is in trouble. My weapons are being moved from here. Nothing has been moved yet. Maybe. Maybe not. My men are ready to die today. Yours too? Roger! Running! Soon my bombs will be scattered all over Europe. Ready to be ignited. I've got enough sarin bombs to wipe out entire cities! And any second my men will slip away and continue my mission. And don't forget: you and your team failed! I'm going in! No! This is for you! It's not over! It's not over! Drive out the truck now! Go with him! The truck! Fuck! - Catch the drone! - Yes, sir. Target captured! Two minutes! This is not the end. For you already! - Target aimed. - Permission granted. - Target captured. - Fire! Sir, we are healthy and unharmed. I'll send you a car right away! You come here! Welcome back brother! Everything OK? Yes. It's over. - Let's go home. - Yes. Good work! The fight is not over yet. Only the dead saw the end of the war. I will not miss it here. What do you think will become of this place? The politicians do that. In the night of the future we found a little peace. Peace with the brothers who gave their lives so that this mission will be a success. Amen, brother. Let's get out of here. - I'm getting used to you guys. - At last. After three months. Hey Xu, we all like your new outfit. But you dropped that. Seriously, you look great! Gentlemen. I have to give you one thing. Conditions were tough, but you did it. Thank you, Commander. The past few months have been terrible for all of us. I want to tell you that you are the toughest, bravest soldiers that I know. And if you ever have to fight again, I'll be there. Resign! Sir Hey, are you packing already? You know how it is. Back to the States. See that money comes in. Yes I know what you mean. What is me you I think I'm taking a break. This mission was very different. The environment and the people. So now it's my fault. Nonsense! Never, man. Hey, you were good out there. We were good. And don't mess around so much next time! This is not like you. We were lucky, Mr. President. Very good, Commander. I never doubted the team. - Everything went well. - You earned your vacation. No, I hate holidays. Give the team my regards and gratitude. I will sir. NO SIGNAL How are you doing? - I'll go on tour. - Yet again? I drum the band back together. - The snakeheads. - Well! Punk rock. I'll be lying around on the beach getting a tan take a drink... Be careful. I can't take care of you all the time. That was really an adventure! I will miss you the most. You are still crazy! Everything okay? Will you miss it No. You could always count on me. - We are brothers. - Yes. Oh this mission... Yeah, totally crazy. Come on now! Actually, humanity owes you something. Now get out of here before anything else happens. - Yes, sir! - Get out of here! The best damn team in the world.
