Andrei Ilich, the machinist - Nikolai Ekk You've grown so much! Haven't seen you for three years. And what is that thing on your neck? I'm decorating a tree, wanna see? Let's go! - Wait, wait let me... - Let's go! There! Now that's what I call a tree. Well done, Grunya. Kornachikha, Grunya's mother - Z. Kashkareva Grunya! Mom is back from church! Hide, hide! - Where? - There, there. Everything ready? Everything ready. And your present too. Ah, you fidget! Come, come with me. There. And where's the present? And whose suitcase is it? Well, we have a guest! Alyosha! Son! - Nah. - Who then? I won't say, I won't say! Andrey! My dear! Long time no see, huh? Well, let me look at you. What a moustache! How's my Alyosha doing? - Alyosha? - Yes! Alive, well, sends his regards. Is he coming? Aunt Masha, you know very well Alexei can't come. Again in prison? No. He's free. He's also sent presents for everyone! - Presents, presents, presents! - And... where's father? Dad's gonna come soon, he's on a night shift. On the same evening far away in St. Petersburg... (dance commands in french) Nikolai Pavlovich Luznetsov - Vladimir Batalov Nicola, my dear, why are you so gloomy? Still no telegram. Always about business. What telegram? Well, this... ...is not for woman's brains. (french) You're charming as ever, my dear. My love, what a wonderful ball! The night shift was working among the suffocating clouds of porcelain dust, carrying out an urgent Christmas order. In the adjacent empty workshop Grunya's father was on a watch. Pyotr Kornakov, the watchman - Ivan Lavrov Luznetsov's factory administrator couldn't sleep. Modest Petrovich Navostyanov - Mikhail Doronin A present for Grunya from him... You little rascal! - What a beauty. - New dress, I'll make a new dress! Try it on. And a present to father from Alexei... What? Come on! What a swell tobacco box! Dad's gonna be so happy! Mom! There's fire! The factory's on fire! The pump doesn't work! Grab the buckets! Pass them! Porcelain Factory Help! Help! (mouthing) Daddy... 'congratulations on a merry christmas day' Bravo! Bravo! My dear! Are you pleased? Like in Paris, ma petite! 'report sudden disaster factory wooden housing burnt by fire awaiting instructions. Navostyanov.' My God! Nicolas! How horrible. Merry Christmas! Eagle-wings! When I do business, I get help... from our Lord... from the russian wit... ...and Luznetsov's cunning! A great woe has befallen us all. Today, instead of rejoicing, instead of celebrating the great day of Christmas, we mourn. We mourn for the dead together with you. As for Pyotr Kornakov, the heroic guard who was saving our goods, everyone's goods, as if they were his own, who had sacrificed his life, we'll pay to his family a compensation, 250 rubles. Amen. Thirty-nine coffins. Daddy! (singing 'Memory Eternal') Over the stream Between the leaves A stray nightingale sings. And his stray song Between the pines Sounds like golden chimes. Sweetest nightingale, The Foreman - A. Korsakov Little troubadour, Sing your little tale, Chase away my woe. Sing your little tale... Well... Do I hear singing? Are you working or singing? Artamon Potapych! Please, have mercy, find us a place in the workshop. In the workshop? Both of you? Or only for her? At least for her! We're in dire straits. In dire straits, huh? If you need a favor, learn how to grease the palm. But we have no grease, Artamon Potapych! Not with what they're paying us here! Well... ...all right. You can pay in kind. Send your daughter to me on holidays. She can mop the floor and do the laundry. We'll get along just fine. So how were you singing? Sweetest nightingale... Wrong! They sing like that in churches! Well, how then? Sweetest nightingale... Little troubadour... So, nightingale... ...let's go then. - Mom! - Go, dear, go. Frosya - Valentina Lopatina Frosya! Look, you've coughed up the plate. Varvara - Alexandra Vasilieva It chokes me, the devil. Especially at night. I lie on the bed, and it just starts gnawing me, like a dog... ...and keeps gnawing. You need to understand, Frosya. You... do aerography, our workshop is for hectics. And my rose is made of lead. A deathly rose. Fenka - A. Ignatyeva Hey girls, listen! Artamon Potapych, that old rake, is messing around again. He grabbed me yesterday and tried to feel me up. His ulcer must be eating him, that's why he's so touchy! - Hmpf! - There's no crime grabbing a girl! That old lecher! And here, Grunya... ...they put the dishes for burning. Tanka - Elena Maksimova - Miheich! - What? - Look. Whenever a new girl comes, he's all over her in a second. The hell do you want? You mutt! Artamon Potapych! But what did I do?! Look who's talking now! Tyapchikha - S. Shepanovskaya Whispering lady - Liudmila Tisse So he kicked it... All the dishes broke. God damn him! Now I'll be up to my neck with fines! Be grateful you're still working. When he's in hot blood, you better keep out of his sight. - It's just how he is! - That's right. Girls, it's something else. He's like that because... because there's a... ...rumour going round. That the fire, they say, wasn't an accident, but... ...an arson! And that the director, Modest Petrovich... So who's saying all that garbage? Who's talking crap? Who wants his tongue pulled out? Are you, my dear, tired of having a job? Did the insurance company pay the money? It did! It sure did. - So everything's fine? - Sure is! And you've got a long tongue, woman! I'll shorten it for you! Grunya! Come here. Piece of trash. Get over here, I said! Now gimme this! And stand over there! You're working here now. What did I tell you, scum? - Artamon Potapych... - I'll make your tongue short! Well? Do you want to say something too? You're working here, I said! ...for the celebration of the opening of new stone housings give 7 meters of silk from the factory shop to the workers, at their expense, withheld from their salaries... And sew some new coats for the choir singing praise to the owner, at the factory's expense. Factory manager, Navostyanov. Schadrikha - M. Skavronskaya Everything looks so fancy! - So many dresses! - Tsar and Tsarina portraits! Too bad for Modest Petrovich... - Yes, too bad... - What happened to him? - He had a stroke last night! - No way. - He almost died. Too bad, there'd be one more reason to celebrate. - What's that? - What? - You mutt! What did I order you? Everyone to wear silk. And what is this? A cotton dress? - Artamon Potapych... - Get your ass to the back row! Stand here. We'll have a talk later! Mutt. Well, Grunya! Do you remember what to say? - Of course I do, Artamon Potapych! - Say it then. - Alright. 'We, the workers of our factory...' - Stop! - 'Your factory'. - '...your factory'. 'We, the workers of your factory, are asking us to receive from you...' - 'Asking you - from us!' - 'Asking you to receive from us... ...this gift as a sign of our love and respect'. - Now correct. - Good job! Bring the vase! - Hold it. Here. - Got it. - Hold it, hold it, careful. - Shh, be careful! Now that's a vase! The top! Where's the top? The top! Find the top! ...a sign of our love and respect... ...a sign of our love and respect... - Quit nodding, you look like a turkey! - Okay. 'Okay'! Three hours of my work wasted! Look at you, now you're all shaggy! - And the pin has to be... - A-ah! - Hold it! - Hold it tight! - Okay. - Hold it tight, hold it tight... - And be careful with my dress! I got married in it. - ...married in it, married in it. What're you mumbling about? Don't tear the skirt, you! - And the sleeves... - Attention! It's them! They're coming! Glory to our owner! Glory to our owner! Glory! Glory! Glory in the highest heaven! Glory! Glory! Glory in the highest heaven! Glory! Glory! Well... I'm pleased. The housing look swell. - With the help of you blessing... - Yeah, yeah. How did you smooth things out? Good job. - Your humble servant till the end! - Thank you. God bless. Greetings, everyone! 'We, the workers of your factory, are asking you to receive from us...' Yes! Got it right! Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory to Nikolay Pavlovich! Glory to his spouse, Olga Egorovna! Glory! Glory! Glory! - (in french) What a beautiful girl. - Wha? What a beautiful girl. Yeah. The girl is cute. Well... 'We, the... ...say it. So, we all... And me, too... So, to you... ...this vase here. Phew. Okay. Phew. 'To our beloved owner from loving workers.' What an excellent porcelain! That's right! Our quality! - (french) This is adorable, my friend. - Yes, madam. They worked voluntarily extra hours... - ...to get this vase done. - (french) Thank you very much. Yes, yes. Thank you for your present. Thanks. - Oh! - Oh. Well... I am pleased. Are you? Or do you have complaints? We have a plea... We, the fire widows, beg Your Worship for a pension. Our husbands are dead, and we are in need. (french) Nicolas! What does 'fire widows' mean? The wives of fire victims. Give the fire widows a benefit! Three rubles! - Is everyone happy now? - Everyone! - No complaints? - No complaints at all! You're all we need, Nikolay Pavlovich. And about... About grub... About the grub? What about it? Nicolas, what does "grub" mean? I'm asking you: What's wrong with the grub? She says, the grub could be better. And you? - Do you like everything? - She does, she does! No complaints? My daddy died in the fire, and my mom still hasn't got her pension! - What's your name? - Grunya Kornakova. - Artamon Potapych! - What? - What's the matter? - I, uh... What? I gave you orders! What's that?.. I see. Tell me, my dear. That old man Kornakov, was he your father - ...who died in the fire? - That's right. And does your mother - ...work at my factory? - Mom works here, yes. And your brother, Alexey Kornakov, what is he doing these days, eh? - Sitting in prison. - In prison! Do you know, for what? You don't. For stirring people up! Yes, yes, yes! He went against our tsar! The bastard! Please don't be upset. We can make ten of those. The workers will do anything for you. And the Kornakovs - There won't be even a smell of Kornakov at this factory! Is anybody else unhappy in here? Well? (french) Nicolas, everything's fine! Everybody is silent. So everyone's happy. (french) Let's go, Nicolas. (french) Well, let's leave. By the owner's orders the Kornakov family has been evicted from the factory's cabin... Hey, old woman, if it weren't for me, Grunya would be leaving with you. Everything nailed down, Artamon Potapych. Well... may Jesus save us. Don't bear a grudge, everyone, forgive me, if I did you wrong. Serves 'em right. That wretched scum! Schedrikha, you rotten swine. I wish I'd see you thrown out from your home. Artamon Potapych, now she has no father, nor mother. Look after her. Be like a father to her! I'll set her up in the women's barracks. Now... farewell, my darling. Mom... - Farewell, my dear! - Mom! Crying now? No wonder, when your son is a striker! I wonder, why did they let that broad keep her job? Shut up! None of your business. Mommy! Mom... ...how will I manage all alone? Mom! I wonder, will you approve of of my actions, Alexei? There's nobody to advise with around here. Having all the facts in hands, I've decided to act at my own risk. I must show the women the truth. Woe is dancing, woe is jumping, woe is singing songs. Over the stream Between the leaves A stray nightingale sings. And his stray song Between the pines Sounds like golden chimes. Sweetest nightingale, Little troubadour, Sing your little tale, Chase away my woe. Sing your little tale, Chase away my woe. Chase away my woe. Near the stream on the mead Sits a wailful lad. A lonely boy who can't forget A lassie he has met. Sweetest nightingale, Little troubadour, Sing your little tale, Chase away my woe. Sing your little tale, Chase away my woe. What a voice. And the song is good too. You... Why didn't you... ...come to mop the floor? Didn't you hear the order?! Artamon Potapych! Artamon Potapych! Let's have some fun! Shut up! If you don't come, I'll fire you from the factory. Grunya has left to mop the floors to allay all suspicions of spreading the leaflets. Women! Time to go to church! Get up! Women! Hurry up! Hurry up! Move, damn it! (indistinct chatter) Comrades! Hear the harsh truth. Do you, widows, know that the new housings were built on your tears? Widows and orphans, do you know that the fire... which destroyed the previous housing, happened because someone... had given the order to put twice as much fuel into the furnace... Widows and orphans, do you know why? Insured by "Russia" company For it was not an accident, it was... an arson! The wooden housing was burned by the factory manager Modest Petrovich Sevostyanov! To build new stone housings for the owner. New... stone... housings. Women... So it was an arson. - So it was true. - Arson! Women! It was an arson, not an accident! Nonsense! What arson? (indistinct shouts) Women, wait! - Wait there. Women! - Arson, arson! We're gonna have a talk with him. To the manager! Let's go, women! To the manager! Put the shawl on. If the broads recognize you, they'll kill you! What are you doing here, you hag? I was just looking for Modest Petrovich... and he's not here, it seems. Tell me, where is the manager? I... I couldn't find him! He must've slept at his woman's house. You'll find him there! - Liar. - Liar! Liar! I swear! Cross my heart! Women! I bet he's not at his mistress' but at the foreman's house! - Artamon Potapych! - Grunya... Artamon Pota... An arson! to build new housings for the owner Who wrote this? I don't know. It must be your brother! Could be him. He did this! He did! And you're with him? I'm with him! - You fucking wench! - You old fart! Women! Hit him with all you've got! My dear! The women have read some kind of satanic paper! - About an arson! - And gone insane! Stop talking rubbish! Say it clearly, where are they? The women? They're on strike, locked themselves up in the workshop! Tanya and Grunya Kornakova are leading them! - The machinist stole the locomotive! - To get workers from the other factory! To get help! We'll show those women what's what. They'll remember! 'N.P. Luznetsov' factory founded in 1876 Women! Go! Women! Take cover! Take cover! Women... - What do we do? - We sit here. - And wait for help from the factory. - No, we can't wait. - Let's go straight... - Go where? Straight to what? Tanya... - Can I say something? - Go on. What if we surround them from all the sides and run and really, really throw the dishes at 'em! We are a thousand after all! - She's right! - We'll attack from all sides! And take them alive! I'll take the girls from the grinding, sneak past the engines and hide behind clay. I'll take the women from here and go through the mining! I'll go through graphics and attack from the bath! - And me? - And you stay here, Grunya. As soon as we surround them, you show us the sign. Wave your scarf from the dormant under the roof. Got it? I got it, Tanya! I'll wave a scarf from the dormant! Women! Follow me! Come out. Hurry! Go! Mom... Having learned about what happened at the factory, the governor sent a reinforced punitive dispatchment. Move the train, you bastard. Well?! Get on board, your honour. I'll take you there. Company - get on board! The hell are looking back at? Get off me! Come on! Attack! Attack! The punitive dispatchment! The Nightingale
