Hey, you. Can't give your brother a call? All right, sis. Don't be a stranger. Jenny hello? Oh. Listen, it's your Aunt Joan. I haven't been able to sleep. And I think you need to be here, honey. Okay. Hey Jenny, it's your father. Been calling you like crazy. I really would love to hear your voice. It's me again. Call me back, please. I'm at the house. Okay. Bye. Just a little bit. Yes. Yeah, I know, cause I did that for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, I've missed you, baby. I've missed you so much. I miss you too, Joan. Hey! - Guess what? - What? I made her cinnamon rolls. They're her favorite. You know that? Do you know how handsome you are? - Yeah. - Do you? Yes! Oh my goodness, I can't stand it. Come on in, it's so cold. Are you gonna say hi to Andrew? My Andrew has been gone for a long time. Now's not the time. I didn't come here to relive the past. I'm here for Victor. It's easy to be here when it's too late. And you had the nerve to name your kid after my son. Your own brother. Maybe you should get to know him. I think you'd like him. Jen. Hey, Dad. It's been so long. I've missed you, Dad. Still smoke? Not in a couple years. I'm so sorry, Dad. Lost both your boys. Yeah, I came here 'cause I wanted to celebrate Victor's life. He always found the light in any situation. What'd your mother have to say? Could you make me one? Mom... Was he drinking? Was he alone? He was with a friend. And his friend? Just a few scratches. Usually how it goes. Isn't it? Come here. How are you doing? I don't think we can stay. Just for two days. Till his car's ready? I want you to have it. I can't deal with that right now. Yeah, well. She's a mess. Why don't you stay with your dad? I'd be happy to drive you guys around until the car's ready. How about Victor's? Yeah. You could do that. It's raining from Auntie Jo Jo's eyes. Do you want to go for a ride? You want to go on an adventure? Let's do it, I gotta find my keys. Will you help me? I can't see through all the rain. Okay, come on in. Joining us now is small talk radio host and blogger Mark Lee, thank you so much for joining us. I'm happy to be here. We are now officially, almost anyway, post-bankruptcy, Detroit is, and when will we start to see major changes for the people who live in the city, and what will those changes be? - City's gotten a lot better, you know? Since the days when your mother would let you guys come stay with me. Were you and Vic still close? Oh yeah. He came to church with me every Sunday. He'd do the little things that would make people feel so special. Can you take me to Dad's tomorrow? Come to church with me in the morning and I'll I'll take you after. This is it? Yeah. Cool kid. Wow, you weren't kidding. Mommy, Mommy. In the room, I'll meet you in there. And you knew that was there because? It's where I would have put it. Your brother was such a great artist. You should get some sleep. I will. What the fuck! Who are you? Why do you think Mom still holds such a grudge against me? You're never around. So. You know... When your mom was little, all she ever talked about was having a family. She wanted... Two boys... And a girl. And she got it. She got it all at once. Come on. Let's go. You want some help? You got it, push. Watch your head. Hand-holding and... Welcome to Triumph Church. - Thank you. - Jenny? Beth Kwazinzki. Do you remember me? Farmington High? Class of 2010? Is your brother here with you? So good to see you. Yeah, we must be related. I can do that too. No you can't. Yours is more gross, though. Oh, here's Mommy. Focus here. But I can't... You have to be quiet now. You ready? Let's pray for your mother. Let us not boast on tomorrow. For we not know what the day might bring. Let another praise you. Not your own mouth. A stranger. Not your own lips. You want to know something? You came out first. You're the oldest. Even if it's just by a moment. That means you're the big sister. You have to protect your brothers. Why do I have to? You're all going to be so special. Look after them. You see... It will always be you. My sweet Jennifer. A stone is heavy. Sand is weighting. But a fool's provocation... Is heavier than both. Faithful are the wounds of a friend. Profuse... Are the kisses of an enemy. Hello? Hello? Who is... Is everything okay? That's not your phone. I'm sorry, I... I thought I'd hold onto it. Is this some kind of sick joke? I'm sorry. Who is this? - And why do you have- - It's Jenny, Victor's sister. I just saw it and I took it and I didn't... - Hey. - Hey. Thanks. So. Church with Joan. Feeling saved? Not much to save anymore. You were the easy one, Jen. Maybe when we were younger. You know, no one can blame you for leaving like that. You know that, right? See, this is why I don't come back. I'm tired of the sympathy. Everything will fall into place. You've been through a lot. I am proud. You know, from the moment you were born, it was clear. You're an old soul. When you came out ahead of your brothers, you barely made a sound. For a while your mother and I were concerned, but we quickly realized that you were in this world to forge your own path. And in a lot of ways, you helped us realize what it means to live our own lives. I just want you to see that you have your whole life ahead of you. And I know that you've always fought your brother's battles. I think it's time to put that aside. Do the things that make you happy. Okay. When mom comes back, we had no donuts, okay? There are no donuts. All right, calm, everything's cool. Here she comes. Shh. Shh. Be cool. You had enough sugar? I thought I'd give him some donuts. Hey. Why don't you get some rest? And I'll take the donut monster for the night. Thank you. You earned it, honey. It's the least I can do. Yeah! You're going to play with Auntie Jo Jo. Oh my god, what have I done? Yo, can I help you? Excuse me? No, I'm good. Tandra? Tanja, actually. Who is asking? I am. We're twins. I know where to look. So what took you so long? He told me a lot about you. He talked about me? He said he wanted to see you. I should have returned the effort. Life just- - Happens so fast. Yeah. That's a shame. That he never met his nephew. Yeah. Just wanted to help you. What else did he say? I don't know. He was good. Wasn't he? Looks just like Victor's work. It is. He's gonzo. Who's gonzo? Victor. Are you happy? Jenny? What do you mean? I mean are you happy up there? You know? He was... Worried about you. Why would he say that? He just wanted you to look back for a moment. Did you even realize everything you had here? I have a kid, and I have a husband... And that's just what it is.

I am all in. We've been at this for a long time. Trust me, I'm all in. But I still need to go get some sleep. Keep that shit recording, man. All right, man, look. Just don't steal my production credit, all right? Yeah, whatever. You see? Books everywhere. How many do you think there are? Oh my gosh, good counting. Oh my gosh, how many, how many? That's a lot. Hey. You want to see if you can count them over there? Yeah, go. You find what you're looking for? Yeah. I meant the phone. Yes I did. You know, Tanja's a good girl. She knew Victor a lot better than I ever did. Yeah. Well. He really cared about you. I can't believe you're still reading Agatha Christie. Yeah, it's the last one I haven't read. Did you know any of his other friends? Hang on. Hey Matt. Oh, super. Yeah, we'll be right there. Car is ready. This guy is the best. Hey, stinker. I'm coming for ya. Oh yes I am. I'm so happy you're taking it. You'll put it to good use, Jen. I'm really doing it for you. I mean, Mark lets me use his car whenever I want. Oh, I think you'll be glad you have it. I remember him saving up for it, looking for the right one. Think it was your father's old Deville boy who looked after it. Hey Matt. Joan! Hello, my dear. Hey. - Come with me. - Okay. Let's go. Go to a gas station and let them check out all the fluids in it, make sure everything is okay with it. Okay, all right. Every month, all right. Well, precious cargo. I'm so grateful that you did this. Anything about the car? Is it a good one? Car's a nice old solid car, it's good, frame is good. Body is strong, looked like a tank. Yeah. You're good to go. It's all yours. Get back safely. What are you... What are you doing here? Jenny. I can't believe you would do this in front of Andrew. I'm sorry. What do you want me to say, Jen? Leave. Now. This is my house. Get out! You're just like your mother. Just like my mother? How dare you say that fucking shit to me, after everything you've seen. I look after our son. I look after our home. I even have to look after your fucking affairs because you can't be a real man. You can't even be a father. You can't even look at me! Right, don't see nothing wrong with that, huh? Bro, ain't nothing wrong with it. Yo, I need to tell you. I'm really digging the way you take that sad boy rap and you mixing it with the hardcore shit, man. That is shit there right now. I appreciate that. - I appreciate that. - That shit is art. - I appreciate that. - Thank you, baby. Hey, your boyfriend is really talented. Really dope artist. I can't wait to work with y'all, man. This is gonna be crazy. T. Excuse me for a moment. Yo, T. T. Come on, let's talk. I don't want to talk to you. You're not driving, man. You're one to talk. Look. I know what you're going through. Do you? I do. Because I don't think you'd be over here galloping around it if you actually did. I'm not galloping around anything, T. He wanted this for me. He wanted this for us. He should be here! There's nothing we can do about that right now. You know that better than anybody. Huh? I don't know what you're talking about. Andrew. Andrew. Victor. You shouldn't be here. Mommy. We're here. What are you doing here? All right, well, I'm gonna clean up before heading out. Heading out? Where? A show. - I am so sorry. - It's okay. Come in. I'm glad you're back. Me too. You know... Coming back here, I... Well, it wasn't exactly on my own terms. Most of my life I've been in the passenger seat. It's just me and Andrew now. And you know what? That might not be such a bad thing. Come in here for a second, Jenny. You never took advantage of us being the same size. Aside from my boobs. Yeah, well, that's what happens when you have triplets. Where's the show at? One of Victor's spots. Let me find you something. I would never wear that. Maybe not now. Keep it. Mom. Enough with the dresses. Hey How much? - No thank you. - What? No thank you. Hello. What are you doing here? I didn't want to miss it. It felt right. It's good that you're here. Do you need any help? This is the last one. So now it's turn up time. All right, let's go have some fun, girl. Okay. Thank you. Cheers, babe. Oh. It's been a while. Here's to new beginnings. Can I speak with you? About? Please, Tanja? Be right back. What is she doing here? What? She shouldn't be here right now, T. This isn't good for anybody. I just... Miss him so much, you know? Everything he wanted to happen is happening, but without him. Kash? Sup? Um. I think you knew my brother. You're Jenny. Yeah. What are you drinking? That. Gotcha. - Thank you. - Uh-huh. Oh, well. Already a little tipsy, so... No. Sorry. You're just like I imagined. None said it'd be easy. We're all sad. And we're all hurting. But this is business. Oh, shit. You two were close. Brothers. But I would trade places with him if I could. How's everybody feeling? I said how's everybody feeling? That's better. It's my honor and my pleasure. Now it's time to go live the lie. To introduce you guys. The man of the hour. Let's hear it for Kash. Yo yo yo, what up though, what up though. Sad to say, but this might be our last little night. I know. 'cause y'all been mad supportive over the last couple of years. The love is for real. Somebody isn't here, though. Thank you for driving me. Yeah, no problem. Is your car gonna be okay there? Yeah, I'll just pick it up in the morning. Thanks. Really felt like he was there tonight. And what are you doing here? I'm all set Hmm. Are you coming in? So what'd you think of the show? I loved it. Man. Your brother. He had real... Raw talent. Yeah. You and him both. He pushed me. I like to think we pushed each other. I am so jealous of this life. An artist, a community. What was your favorite memory with him? Wow. - Now sir. - I'm sorry, officer. I'm sorry, officer, I'm sorry. I didn't do anything, officer. Hey. Hey. Yo, tell me what's up. What's going on? Bugging the fuck out, that's what's going on He was loitering outside. Loitering. Loitering outside his own house. - He lives here? - He lives here. God damn right I live here. Do you wanna file a complaint? Or you wanna let him go? Yeah, that's right. Officer Simmons. Watch it. Okay. How dare you be drunk and black at the same time? How dare you swoop in and be the white savior. It would have been tonight. I got signed tonight. We've been talking about this moment for... A very long time. I can't do this, Jenny. I understand. I'm come by tomorrow night. We'll celebrate for real. I swear it looks like one of Victor's paintings. Your brother found inspiration in every corner of this city. So you're going to Kash's thing tonight? What'd you just say? What? Yo, how do you know about that? He told me. When, Jenny, when did he tell you? He was at the loft already when you dropped me off. We didn't do anything, Tanja. What did he say? We just talked about Victor. He was lucky to have someone who had his back like that. Lucky. Right. Did I say something? Nope. Of course not. What is going on, Tanja? I shouldn't be saying this. All right, we'll meet y'all there. Yo, wait up, wait up. I'm gonna ride with Gonzo. I gotta talk to my mans. Your mans? Yes, my mans. Come on, T. Can you live without me for a moment, baby? Exactly. Can I live without you? You know what, I'm gonna be just fine, you know... Uh-uh. My man. You got the keys? No, you are not driving. Look. See? I'm good. Like a true professional. Come on, T, we'll beat 'em there. Yeah, in your dreams. What a show, baby. They found... Victor's body in the driver's seat. Maybe they stopped somewhere. Gonzo took the wheel. I don't know. Jenny, you shouldn't come tonight. You know, I don't want you getting dragged any further into this. Jenny. Are you even listening? - I thought you went up north. - Hmm. Yeah, didn't go as planned. Mark do something? Dad, what would you do if you found out someone hurt one of us. Are you okay? What did he do? Oh, not him. Dad, what would you do? - Jennifer, - - Dad! I would do whatever it takes. You're all I have now. I love you, Dad. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. You can't wait for someone to call you back? Yeah, are you with Jenny? No. Shit. Okay, I'll be there in a minute. You're leaving soon? Yeah, in a few, Ma. I'm so proud of you, baby. You're being so strong. I'm just... I'm just trying to make it work, Ma. It's all gonna be worth it in the end. Where's Helen? In the house. - What is it? - It's Jenny. She stopped by the house earlier. She didn't seem like herself. Something's off. She's fine. I haven't seen her this content in years. Helen, I'm really worried. Trust me. I know my daughter. This is where you're staying? Yeah, they put me up well. Bless us, Lord, and these gifts which we are about to receive. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. Thank you, that was really good waiting. Now you can eat. Well. You look nice. So why'd you want to see me? Would you mind driving? I just have these heals on. Yeah, of course. Pull over. You good? Yeah. Good. What do you think my brother would think of all this? All of what? You and me in this car. All of it. I think he'd be happy. You're getting a glimpse into his life. You think so? Yeah. What was that? It was Andrew's. My mom used to always tell me when I was little that I had to protect them. I had to look after them. 'Cause I'm the oldest. Even if it was just by a moment. Jenny, what... Take me to where it happened. What? Hello? Take me there! Okay. We're going. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Why do you even want to come back here, Jenny? What's this going to do for you? He was my... He was my brother. And you took him. Victor was your brother. Gonzo was mine. I'm more than willing to tell you all about him. What kind of cigarettes he smoked. What kind of paint he used. I need to know what happened. That's right. It's not about Victor. It's about you. No... It's about Victor. What are you gonna to do? Kill me? Because you ran away? Because you don't know how to confront yourself? I'm more than willing to let you in on his life. Look, I can rest in peace. I've confronted myself. I know who my mother is. I know who my brother is. Did you know your brother? Fuck you. You don't get to tell me about my mistakes. I know what I've done. I know what I haven't done. I need to know what happened. Shit. Shit, Gonzo. Gonzo. Gonzo. Shit, shit, shit, fuck, fuck, fuck, Gonzo. Gonzo. Gonzo. Shit. I know I deserve to be in his place. I should be dead. Shit. I was the one who was driving. Yeah, and you made a lot of decisions between now and then, Kash. And you don't think I've been carrying this guilt? Don't talk to me about guilt. I've been carrying the guilt of an entire family for seven years. You abandoned your family. And now you're about to abandon your son. For what? Or is this one big justification? If it took your brother dying for you to show up for him... Then that's no one's fault but your own. You know what? Fuck it. Do it. Because God knows and I know that I loved the shit out of your brother. And if this is how I pay my price. If that means dying right here, right now, then fuck it, do it. Just do it. Do it already. Just do it. Do it. Guess not today. You fucking... You fucking shot me. It's okay. It's okay It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Anyone home? Police. Is anyone home? If anyone's home, please open the door. Police. Open the door. open the door now.
