But, yes, this is the voicemail you said no one has ever left you. Three minutes of everything about someone you've just met. Enough to know whether or not it's worth it. Tara Reata. You know that's about the most beautiful name I've ever heard, even if it is fake. You're absolved. Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind meets Liz Taylor in Giant, right. Two great ranchers, Tara and Reata. Maybe you're more of a fantasist than I realised. So let a few dates in. I need you to know exactly where we are with that. Tom, he's worked in my office for three years. But I honestly had no idea he was in love with you. I have an insipid trophy wife, Lisa. We married on a whim when she saw the money. Biggest mistake of my life. I know I'm not 24 anymore, but she's got claws so far in my back, I'm surprised I haven't actually bled to death. Only she can tell you if we're together or separated, which is why I've called you now, which is why I'm telling you now. I'm ready for divorce. I know it's gonna cost me, but I think my sanity is a small price to pay. We have a daughter, Charlotte, who I barely see. She might be part of my equation in the future. I don't know. We have a nanny slash hired mother, who does her best to side with Lisa, and she has sisters who come and go with conflicting advice. Vicky, her eldest sister, is potentially more compassionate. Jan is the more troubled of the two. But I'll give you my horrible confession because I can only be honest now. I met Jan first. She introduced me to her sister, Lisa. And as a man with no soul left, I chose vanity. But Jan has too much dignity to ever raise this as an issue. And our mutual friend is Tom. My wife was the girl who ruined his life without thought of consequence. I don't know whether he told you that or not. I know what he does. I know Jules, his assistant. I know Becky and all the other models on his list. You see, Tom thinks we have no idea about his other profession. But there is something very rotten in this Denmark. So, Tara, that's my life. Let's take it slow because I reckon we might have something in a semi-something background. Take care. James. - I love you, baby. I love you so much.

I've gotta get this one. - Tomorrow. - I'm on a shoot tomorrow. - You can shoot me. No. We've done that. - Please, I want to be able to make things up to you. How? - Whatever it takes. I'm not sure what it would take. Now? - No, I mean in the day. I'm working. - More photography. - An agency. - Largely clothed women, the same. Sometimes they get naked. You know this. - To be honest with you, I think they probably just think I'm a bit of a prude. - That's what really what you want to do though, is it? It's just what gets you off. It does depress me sometimes. But then... I meet someone like you and I realise that the pictures are just that. Pictures. This girl this morning. She was pretty, perfectly formed, nice body, an angel face. But you know what? I didn't want her. I didn't love her. I could see that the pictures of her would be someone's fantasy. Not mine. Some other guys. I create fantasy. You know the answer to that. They're in the same place. I've not looked at 'em since I took them. No, that was my possessive streak. - Look, can you cope with me taking photos? I mean, it's a serious question. It's a bit of a deal breaker. Do you want them? - No, not really. - Not really isn't no. For god's sake, I can separate work from play. - Please. Let me come back. Just so we can see. - My parents' house. - Well, that's what you usually do when I'm working. - So, I can sleep. We can talk in the morning. I love you. - Yeah. I love you, too. Look, I'm on a shoot this afternoon. No. I'm sorry, you're not in the shoot. Jules is the assistant, you know that. - I like Jules. Yeah, I like Jules, too. Don't start. - Because we both know you've got your own problems. The wedding is next month. You are invited. We would both appreciate seeing you there. - A word of advice, James. If you can live with men in deceit, you'll have a happy marriage. If you can't, then don't marry a liar. That's all. I never realised you had such a high opinion of Lisa. But I take your advice. I'll see myself out. How are we lucky? I mean, I've worked for everything, haven't I? I mean, you're not with your sisters at the moment. But, the new house, is it too much? - No. It's perfect. It just seems so extravagant after what we last had. - Yeah, but wouldn't your dad like to see you now? - Yeah, well, my dad's not here to see it anymore, James. - He's still around in spirit. - It's just difficult, you know. - You've got family, Lisa. We've got great times ahead of us. - Yeah, I know. I just feel so guilty. I've got everything but nothing. - We don't have nothing, Lisa. Are you keeping up with that prescription? - No, I can't. It's just making me feel even worse. - Come on, you need to take taking them if you want them to work. Hey, look, how's Maria getting on with Charlotte? - We wouldn't even be living if she didn't look after her so well. She's more of a mother than I am. - Yeah, but, Lisa, you're her mother. Come on. Don't beat yourself up over this. I mean, we have been through so much in the past year. - That's why I'm saying, aren't we lucky. We've got all of this. All of these material things and at what price? - Your dad's gone, Lisa. I'm sorry. I don't know what I can do about it. - He's always been gone. - We go over this every night. - It's just so difficult. And you know why it's so difficult for me. I mean, what is so difficult? - You. You look like him. You dress like him, and you act like him. - I can't help that. - I know. I know you can't. I just, it's so difficult. I just, I look across the room, and I don't know whether I'm looking at my husband or my dad anymore. - I listen. I listen. And I listen. And then I realise, I just can't help you unless you're prepared to let go and tell me. - You've got to tell me what happened to him. I mean, the whole thing with your dad is just an excuse. Or at least it's become one. That daddy had me, is that what you think? - Maybe. I don't know. I honestly don't know. - Well, daddy didn't have me, James. Sorry to disappoint you if that idea got you off. - Stop it, Lisa. I think you're drunk. - All right. I'll tell you. Do you remember Tom? Yeah. Used to be in IT, moved to another department. A photographer now, I think. Where are you going with this, Lisa? I mean, have you had an affair? Is that what this is? Is that what this has all been about? - At the Christmas party, Tom came up to me and he said, he said. I was with this girl. And nothing happened, but we were really close friends. And then we had this five minute conversation that destroyed my life. - All right, I get it. And it was you he had the five minute conversation with? - Yeah, but the five minute conversation didn't happen then. - A few years ago when I was 16. - Not a day goes by when I don't think about what I said. - So what was this stupid conversation a few years ago about? - Not much. He just said if he was to look after me, it's because I needed looking after. Because he thought that my mom didn't treat me right. - So he liked you. So what? - Something else happened a week before then. It wasn't much, but I felt so stupid for letting it happen. I got drunk, and I got taken advantage of. - I thought we talked about everything we had to tell each other about our private lives. - Yeah, well, some things have to remain private. - So you're telling me this one bad. - And this bad first time was with Tom, right? - No. This prick wasn't Tom. It was somebody else. I can't remember his name. - So, come on, tell me. What has all this got to do with Tom? - I destroyed his life. - Do you remember that film we watched the other night? - I don't see the films you see. - There always on in the background. - But I'm not obsessed like you. You do. How does that work? - You know you are. - No, it's not that bad. - No, it's not that good, either. - Why is there always a barrier between us? - Because I don't hero worship the people you do. - You do. Every time you say something, all it is with you is did you see this? Did you see that? Do you remember this? I didn't. Period. Things are strained enough as they are already without you stretching things even further. - I'm trying to live here. What? What are you talking about? - It's been four months already. You think I'm not thinking about our little? Look, I can't do this right now. I've been out of the loop for a reason. - Maybe I am, too. - Because everything around here is dead or dying. You get me involved with you and drag me through all this shit for what? I should be with my friends finishing one part of my life and beginning the next. I could even finish my education if I want. But no, I hook myself up with you. For what? This tragedy and torment. You just sit there and watch the films. That's where you live. Movie land. And where do I fit in for you? I don't. Is that whole truth or what? You love me so much that you think that by forgetting me I'm going to forget about what has happened to us. But I'm not because I need you to help me. I need you to be here with me. And to do that, you have to invest your emotions in me. - I don't think I'm ready for this. I need to move on so badly from this, but I just don't think I can. - Then don't. - I've got to. I can't let this kill me. - Let it kill me then. - No, it has already. We have to find something that's going to help us. - We should never have got involved. - I don't care. We are involved, and we have to find something that is going to make this better. That is going to help us. - Maybe we should start from scratch then. - Relive everything that we've done up until four months ago. - I've been doing that every day in my head. Every time I'm watching those films, I'm not actually watching those films. I'm watching our life in exact, minute detail, and I see the happiness in your face turn to despair. My legs give way, but I know what's just happened. I hate that movie in my head. I wish I could erase it, but I can't. - Well, make a film about me then. - I can't. - You always said you would. - I can't. - Because I don't have the drive anymore. I can't even get out of bed any more. You know that. Do you not think I feel like that a little bit, too? Look at me. I can't live with myself, and I'm asking you to help me and help us. Look, you've got that stupid little video camera. Why don't you use it? And we can use it to-- - I bought that video camera for a reason. - I know. I know, to make a film. But that changed. It was going to be a film about someone entering this world, and it was going to be beautiful. But, as much as it hurts me to say this, that is never going to happen. - I couldn't. - I had a list and everything. - Okay, you had a list. What would you have named her? - Tara. - I don't like Tara. - Tara's important to me. - I know because you made it important to you. - Fine. What would you have named her then? - I don't know. Hi, Jan. This is James. - Hi James. So what's wrong with little fruitcake this time? Depressed, suicidal. Usual problems for a 19 year old girl who's lost her dad and was neglected by her mother for most of her life. - Fly away, James. We've all got problems. Lisa is ill, but she's making herself worse because she won't face up to her issues. Yourself, included. Oh, I don't know exactly what she blames you for. Daddy, possible. But you don't stop upsetting her whether she hears from you or not. - Mothers and daughters, James. Not fathers and sons. Look, we're not going to let this descend into an argument. - Try me. I want to come over for dinner on Sunday. - Can't. No, I can. But Sunday was always supposed to be family day. Lisa would never call it that. I don't care. But, all right, I just want a civilised meal. Can we manage that? Your sister hates me as much as you probably do at the moment. - My god. Little girl must be ill. Replacement daddy must have really pissed her off. So you think I really am that much like her father? - Unfortunately, you are. All right, tell me. What went wrong? - Mom never really did like him that much. He was too devoted to his job and not to me. But that's on me, isn't it? First kid at 16, last at 32. Look at me. I lived my life. I never wanted children, now I've got three. Me and my mom and Vicky, we forced our dad to walk away. Lisa was what, 10, when that happened. Her dad was there everyday of her life, not a day apart ever. And then he was gone. And now he really is dead. He won't be coming home. The whole time that he was alive, she had that hope. You can't replace that feeling of hope by looking like him and being like him. That's why Lisa's ill, James. Her dad's gone and her sisters know she was daddy's fucking girl. There. That's the most sincere conversation I've ever had with you. Well, Jan, I appreciate your honesty. - Sunday then.

You're right. I'm not entirely sure what you want me to say here. I supposed we could, um, start from the beginning. I've been drinking. I've been drinking a lot. Smoking, too, and I guess that's to do with the drinking. Don't feel like I'm 30. I feel like I'm 10 years old and I'm peddling home like a nutcase on my tiny little BMX because some bigger kid swatted me. I'm scared. I've no idea what I'm scared of. I don't want to go out in the big, wide world. Why? I just don't have the ability to do it. I can't cope. How are you then? Not as low. Are you on top then? - I think so. Maria and I took Charlotte out. Maria showed us some of the little things that she likes that I just can't do. You know, the lovely things. Are you happier with your daughter now? - No. Why not? - She looks like me. It's like having a miniature me running around everywhere. Doesn't she have any of me in her? - She shits and pukes. Is that enough? Is that a joke? - Sort of. I just look at the baby, and, no, I don't see you in her because I'm so wrapped up in seeing me in her. I just think, what's gonna happen when she grows up, and one day, she can't find daddy in the house? That's why I don't see you in her.

You know, you really pushed his life in a different direction. - Are you happy now you found out a little bit extra about me? That's why he's coming over on Sunday.

He works for you, I assume. - I think you met him before. You see, I'm his boss. But he used to be friends with Lisa here. Well, that was until she made an allegation against him. But I think they've sorted things out now. Right, Lisa? - You were at school then, weren't you, Lisa? I remember him. I went along with Lisa to keep her quiet. - You know, I can believe that now. - It was only four years ago, James. You make it sound like she's done something similar to you. - Time heals, apparently. - Yes. Yes, I do. Tom obviously can't make it. So, let's drink to the future. - The past is the past. To the future. - The future. - I'm leaving you, James. I want a divorce because I hate you. - I want your heart on a chopping block because you are deliberately making a scene, dear. We all know you're ill. - I'm not ill, James. I just realised that I hate you. - And I hate you, too. I mean, come on. What have you ever actually done for me? - You got to work all hours and just leave me by myself. It's the ugliest thing you've ever seen. She makes me sick every time I look at her. I hate it. - Lisa, get a grip. You just don't know the problem. He is the problem. - No, the problem is that you can't keep your legs shut. - No, no. You and I might not have had the best relationship, but I'm not stupid. Your husband might be, but your boyfriend certainly isn't. - James, go into the other room. Now. I want to talk to my sister. Or do you think you can mutter it? Do you want to know why you're hurting so much? Why you're so low? Why you can't appreciate this? - I don't know who her dad is. - Yes, you do. - I don't know what to do. - Divorce, dear, and custody will follow. - You haven't ruined it yet. You've upset a lot of people, but you haven't ruined it. James, come in here, will yoU? Lisa, Charlotte, and I will be staying at my house for a few weeks. She needs to see a few people at least. - I don't love you. I haven't loved you for so long. I'm sorry, this just isn't a life for me. - They didn't really say much. - No, not while I'm here. - No. - I don't know. You're absolutely beautiful. You're absolutely amazing. - Is this what you did when you divorced dad? - I didn't divorce your dad, Lisa. Our mother did. Except when he walked away from us, he was more than happy to keep his attention on you. - I can't tell you that. - Not before he destroyed me. - Why didn't you just tell me that a few years ago? - You couldn't listen. Do you remember when you were at school, you accused that man of nothing? - It wasn't nothing. - It was nothing, it was pathetic. You can never fool me, Lisa. You can deceive everybody else, but you were never a very good liar. - You neglected me for so long. - Yes, I did. Our father made you into this little brat. You had everything when you wanted it. You swallowed through life as if it was just you. When dad came around to visit, he was interested in you. Not me or Vicky, not your sisters. He wasn't even interested in being civil to mom. He was just interested in you, little baby Lisa. His darling. That's why you've picked these men who indulge you. That's all dad did, indulge you. Did he indulge me? No. Did he indulge Vicky? No. He ignored us. I ignored him because we went through the divorce as adults. We weren't the family. We were individuals. And you were just a little girl wondering why your daddy wasn't there anymore. We knew why daddy wasn't there anymore. We'd all driven him away because the only person who was important to him was you. There. Jealousy from your mother and your sisters. - So that gave you the right to ignore me every weekend? - We left you to your own devices because that's all you would do. If ever there was a feral child, it was you, my dear. What was I, some kind of animal? - Yes, you were sometimes. Do you not remember me picking up this lifeless wreck from the remains of 100 consecutive house party? Do you not remember the ambulances and the days in hospital having your stomach pumped? Think about your life, Lisa. You tried to kill yourself inconspicuously because you didn't want to have to admit that you actually had some problems. Yeah, mother dear may have caused them, but you exaggerated them. Look at you. You had everything, and you're throwing it away because you're a selfish bitch loathing in self pity, wanting to blame everyone except herself. There. Now that's a heart to heart for you. You're 19 with the experiences of someone 10 years older and I'm telling you to grow up and take on some responsibility. Or else you'll be dead in the gutter like you were when you were 16. You blame your life on stupid men who've been fool enough to look after you, but I feel sorry for all of them because you've cheated all of them. Now don't cry wolf to me or anyone else when you realise you've got real problems up there. - That is the first time I've ever been truly frank with you. We're apart because we can tear each other apart. But now's the moment to think about your future. Are you saying that I should just go back to James? - No. I'm saying the reason you're in this state is because you've never taken control of your life. You're acting like a 13 year old. For the sake of James, for the sake of Luke, be an adult. Don't be the little girl they've made you think you are. - That's the lawyer's problem. Does Luke know? - I don't even know. - Then leave the next move to them. Lisa, we've talked through all of this. These are your decisions now, not mine. Tom, it's James, your boss. Look, I don't really know you, but I feel I probably should. I mean, I feel you know more about my wife, Lisa, than I actually do. And you haven't spoken a word to that girl in years, right? Anyway, I pulled your file out earlier. Surprised me. What are you doing in this job, Tom? I mean, when it comes to politics, Christ. You've got more qualifications than me. - I don't know politics. Ah, but you know you do really. You're not a monkey campaign photographer. To me, you're more like an office mole. - Maybe I'm just in it to keep sane. Why? What else do you do? - It's a light paw. What do you mean? - Well, I meant it when I said photographer. So what have you been doing here for the past three years? - Trying to get legitimate. Trying to be legitimate, eh? It doesn't work, does it? - Not really. Not when there's the internet. Well, listen carefully. My wife now wants to divorce me. - Yeah. I hate your wife probably as much as you do right now. So, I suppose I could be your office mole. How? - You know, Luke, lover boy who brings us all the shit coffee? Yeah, I know that idiot who we still haven't promoted beyond office junior. - That's the one. I know him. - That's Lisa's boyfriend. For real? Oh, you're kidding me. - I'm afraid so. Well, thank you for the heads up. You know, we might actually have to have a beer after all this. - Yeah. I'll clear my diary. Yeah, I'll see you around. - See you at work sometime. - Oh, it was James from the campaign headquarters. - Oh, Jesus Christ. Will you get over it? We used to do this all the time before I got pregnant. You've got whole books of lover boy tapes somewhere, I'm sure. That was our thing. I wanted to do it, and I wanted you to do it because it turned me on. And now I leave that stupid machine recording for five minutes while you're sober enough to decide whether you want me to use me or not and it's the worst thing in the world. That is what is wrong with you. You're a hypocrite. You're an absolute hypocrite. So how do you want me then, huh? You want to fuck me? Or do you want to be selfish? I'll do whatever you want. That's all it is with you, isn't it? Emotion, guilt, blackmail. Getting so intense. Getting jealous that I might speak to someone that you don't like. Being myself. Look, what is this all about? It's not like we haven't done all this before. - Trust. Everything that we've been doing here is about building the trust that we used to have. - We can still do that. Look, this is just one little thing. It's not gonna ruin. I mean, what did you think I was gonna do? Sell the tape? - You might as well have been spying on me. - Oh, Jesus Christ. Will you get over it? It's just an excuse, your whole trust argument. You're embarrassed because it's the first time we've been so much as next to each other. - I'm not embarrassed. Then what are you? - I'm obviously not what you're looking for anymore. Don't be stupid. - Well, we don't want to be with each other. We don't want to have sex. We don't want to do nothing. The only thing keeping us together is Tara. - We never named the baby Tara. - Well, now that dead little baby Tara who you never let me see, touch, or be near because you cleverly manipulated the situation is gonna be called Tara. Tara Reata. You bastard. You want to name our daughter after some stupid bit in your stupid favourite film? How do you think I feel? Am I not just a little bit helpless, too? - You're not helpless. You're a manipulator. - Fuck off. All right, maybe I'm just a jealous, easily embarrassed, prudish, paranoid guy. But I'm like that for a reason. How can you blame me for what happened to our baby? - Because you didn't want her. You wanted the life that you have now, and you just let her go. And do you remember that one time that we actually did have something? And I said to you, you can do whatever you want. Do whatever you want as long as I don't know about it. And what was that one thing I told you not to do. There. That's betrayal. - Oh. So reaching ahead now, is it? - Yeah, babe. You've finally opened your eyes. - Maybe I have. Well, your baby isn't dead. Our baby isn't dead. Your baby isn't dead. Our baby isn't dead. Your baby isn't dead. Do you want to read it? - Well, now's a good time to remember who you slept with if you want a paternity test. - If he wants to know if he's the real dad, then he'll have a test done. - Wave goodbye to everything you have. - Nice, quickie divorce, I guess. - It says here that he wants access rights over Charlotte's as well. This is ridiculous. Why doesn't he just talk to me about it? We can sort something out. Why is he being so heavy handed? - He's not, Lisa. He's just respecting the situation and going through the formalities. When's the hearing? - Dunno. It just says that the application was made on the 11th of May. - Well, it'll be about November then. - I can't do this. - Lisa, be honest. Who's the father? - Yeah. Not you and me, though. - You know, there was only one time that actually had something with James. It was before Charlotte. Just, I thought that there was nothing that would keep us going. But, we went to bed, and he just took me slowly. But we were so, so close for those few minutes. I thought it would last forever. But it didn't. It just ruined it. He ruined the moment. And I don't think we've ever been able to get that back since. - But you've got that bloke. Can he support you, though? - I don't care if he can or can't. I just need that emotional support. And he has that at least. - You'd better agree to a test if they want one. Yes, no? Tell me. - Lisa, you're gonna have to work that out for yourself. Spend some time with your daughter. - I think now's good time for us to be straight with each other, don't you think? - I've always been straight with you. It was fun while it lasted. You had me like a dog, got me pregnant, convinced me to have the baby. But I didn't want it. How deep does that cut? I bet that cuts real deep. I didn't want it because with you as her father, she would've turned into a little dog, a little miniature me. Adored on and doted on, and where would I be? Ignored. I'd become the baby factory fucked every nine months to shit out your little bastards every other year. Whilst Tara Reata heads your brood and you live through her. That's your dream, isn't it? - Thanks. Thanks for telling me. So I know now that you didn't have a stillbirth. Is that how you convinced then nurse? Father didn't want nothing to do with it. Just fucked off. I said you were a manipulator. The facade of our relationship has just shattered. - And you were gonna live with this secret? - No. I was going to dump you first. That's why I came back. - I could kill you, I honestly could. - But you won't. - Because I still have the vital threads of information. I gave birth to a healthy baby, Vivien, on June the 18th, 2017. I cuddled her in my arms, named her, and they took her away. - I put her up for adoption. - I don't care. - No, I hated the sight of her. What I could see in her was you and me, what never has been and what never will be. - Vivien. No second name? Whose last name did she take? Mine or yours? - She's just Vivien Reata. - Because I never knew why Tara meant so fucking much to you. I know it's my name, but I'm not the Tara that's important to you, am I? Not the fact that you'd just given our baby away? Did that just slip your mind? Oh, my boyfriend, he wants to name the baby after his girlfriend and I have no idea why. Oh, well, just fucking give it up. How could you do that? - I wasn't thinking. - You were thinking. And then you disappeared for a month. How do you think I felt? I didn't know what was going on. All I knew, you were at your parents. Were you? - Yes, yes I was at my parents. - I don't even know what to think any more. When did you come back? - A few months ago. - About 11 in the morning. Has it been a reconciliation? Has it been what you expected? - I was expecting a continuation. - Oh, so you have motives then. - Let's be straight with each other. Motives, we both have them. I thought, I thought you were coming back to be with me. But now I know we just want something different. Tara, I'm not here to be with you. I'm here to conclude my life with you. - But you won't do that because you love me too much. - Yeah, I love you enough to know that this is not gonna work. This is not gonna happen. Last night I loved you and I adored you and I felt things I never felt before, but not it's just been stripped away. - Stop it. Stop, stop it, you bastard. You're just doing this to hurt me even more than you need to. I respected everything you said because I trusted you. You don't understand trust. You don't understand anything. I understand you enough to understand that I didn't want to be suffocated anymore. And all you ever did was ask to be suffocated. How did I? - You never took responsibility for anything that required an ounce of independent thought. - Well, it's really coming out now, isn't it? Well, what do you want? Me to start listing your faults? Oh, no, wait. I've done that already. Cuss at each other. Well, it's not gonna work. - Okay, just stop. What do you want? It's time to make a decision because I just can't hear you anymore. I wanted you. I wanted our baby. I wanted the life that we should have had, but it's, it's not gonna happen. There's no hope for us. Not now, not ever. I'm going to go back to work. You may not agree with it. It may make you jealous, but it pays the bills. And, you know, something may come from it. - Live on the sex. Okay, okay, I'll call up Jules. You can come on the new shoot. It's time to make some decisions, Lisa. - I don't think I can go on with Luke anymore. Not at the moment. Not with him. - Well, it's time you should know then. He resigned from James's company and office a few days ago. Why did he resign? - Well, let's just say he was pushed a bit. - This is so difficult. Why the sudden change of heart? - I had in my head that Luke was the father. And he's not. - Yeah, it's a problem. - James. James is the father. Do you love James? Yeah. - You want to get back with him, don't you? - Yes and no. - For the first time in my life, I'm going to make my own decisions on something. - For god's sake, kill the man with a little grace. I don't know what to say. I leave you for one day. You leave me for one day. - I leave you for one day. You can't say that. Do you remember when you left me for four weeks with Jan to go to Australia? Who's gonna talk to me then? No one. No one except maybe Luke. And the school for giving me free meal tokens. And they phoned social services about mom, but they couldn't do anything because I was 16. Everything that happened then has made me who I am now, and I hate it. I hate myself. I loathe myself. Well, aren't you gonna react to me? It's over with Luke. There's nothing left to say, is there? If that's what you want. To get back with James? - No, I've just realised something.

That's what you did. - We had everything, James. - Yeah. Yeah, we had everything. And now we have nothing. - I don't understand. What am I supposed to do? - Look, I need some help in what I do.
