Bornholmer Street The unbelievable, but true story of Lieutenant Colonel Harald Schaefer Duty Rosta November 9th, Thursday Did I forget my cookies here? I'll take one. Did you hear anything new about your stomach problems? Bowel, Uli. The examination is tomorrow. Do you have a cigarette? Thank You. Think about your smokers leg. I don't have a smokers leg. What is that? Can you focus on that? There! This...this is the border of the German Democratic Republic go...stay on your side. You better not... You better not. Halt! Stop! Peter? Harald? Unauthorized border crossing of a dog. Understood. Now we have a problem. Unsupervised dog on the border. Alarm guards. Your Cookies. Please undo those straps. And the chocolate box, I'd like to take a look in it. There is just bread rolls in there. Mom! A dog! Halt, you dog! Jens! Be ready! He is comming! Halt! Halt! Stay! Axel go...go I have him... I have him. Jens...Jens... come on...go [Everyone] Jens! Shit Man... [Both] Why didn't you... Is it a boy or a girl? Girl. A good girl you are. The boss. Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, border traspasser arrested. Thank you, comrades. Come here... Giver her to me Harald. The commanding officer really has different responsibilities. I'll take care of it, Uli. The Party Secretary really has different responsibilities. I should examine it... maybe it has spyware on its body, Harald. Yeah... maybe a nuke, Uli. Thank you, Comrades. Mission accomplished. Carry on. Now, get out everything. Everything. Apprehension of a dog. Name? Date of Birth? Address? Good girl. Here: "Animals in cross border traffic" The dog has to be examined. I am serious, Harald. I am doing just fine, Uli. Anything else? Breed? Maybe we should have asked Uli. He used to have a Pudel. The dog is an open investigation, Harald. I am responsible for that, that is just how it is. Comrade Lieutenant, make a report. information about the search object arrest protocol, medical report. You know the drill. Have fun with your "Investigation" That is my cookie. You know what my dad always said? "Communism is Collectivisim" Public welfare. Sharing. Heinz. See you later, Comrades. The dog stands on the enemy side. At the gate. Looking into the German Democratic Republic. And Offenbach looks at it and thinks: "It is not going to run across, is it?" And says: "Halt! Stop! No step further!" The dog looks back and starts running left, right, all across the compound. And they catch it after a while, and I bet he is putting it in the holding cell. And the dog is going to get tortured by Uli. Electroshocks, of course... of course. Until he confesses. "Shot while escaping." Good day. [Collective] Good day. Hey, Ilona. Can you give me one with cheese and a coffee? It is unusually quiet here today. Where is the dog? In the custody of the party. [TV] possible to leave through border checkpoints of the GDR [TV] What? Comrade, I was told that such information was already distributed [TV] today, you should have it. It says: "Private travel to other countries can be [TV] requested without giving information regarding reason for travel or family ties. [TV] The visa will be granted immediately by the local police offices without giving the [TV] previously required information." [Reporter] When will this take effect? [Schabowski] Thos goes into effect... from what I know... right now. Immediately What kind of mental bullshit is he saying?! [Schabowski] According to the press office the Ministry Council decided that until a law has been passed, this temporary rule is in effect. You just have to sign the report. Then I can put it to the files. [Schabowski] There has already been information put out concerning this. Operative Management Center, Colonel Kummer. Schaefer here, border crossing Bornholmer street. I am calling about the statement made by Schabowski during the press conference. You are calling because of that nonsense? Yeah... that is why I am calling. What is that about? You know that GDR citizen need a passport and a Visa, right? Yes, I know that. So what is the problem? Or... are there already people standing at the border? I can't see that from here. Then... before you overreact, assess the situation. Schafer? Yeah? Don't scare your men. Yeah... What were you thinking? Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, a calm front on the friendly side. Were there people here that wanted to leave without a visa? Without a visa? No, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. If any show up you send them home. Of course. Send them home, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. Closed. What are they doing? Rambold, Hoffmann. Always keep calm. Understood? Understood. What are they looking at? Comrade Kummer, the first people are closing in on the border. How many? Four. What are they doing? They are looking at us. Where are they? About 100 meters from the gate. Keep watching them. If they come to you, you send them away. Schabowski must have misunderstood something. Schaefer? Yes? Don't get nervous. Yeah... Don't get nervous, Harald. Don't get nervous. Yes? Harald, they keep coming. I am on my way. Sit. Sit. Sit. Good. I thought, I should take it for a walk before it causes problems, Harald. You should take Comrade Schabowski for a walk, Uli. Are you saying Comrade Schabowski is a dog? He is causing problems, Uli! Juergen! What is going on here?! Juergen, I am talking to you! The boss is on his way. Don't wet your pants, kiddo. Schabowski said some nonsense in a press conference earlier. On Tv. He said everyone can travel into the west now. What, everyone? I don't know. Schabowski said that goes into effect right now. What, right now? He said "Immediately". What do we do now? That is the question. Comrade Schaefer, what do we do now? We follow the old regulations. What is going on here? Schabowski said everyone can travel into the west now. What? I don't understand. There is nothing to understand. We are not going to let them provoke us. Good evening, Mister. Good evening. We would like to go to west berlin. And? What "and"? Your passport, please. Why do you need our passport? Did you not hear what Mr. Schabowski said on television? Yes, we did hear that. Can we go now, or what is the problem? If you have a visa. The Comrade said nothing about a visa. Or did you hear something about that? But Comrade Schabowski did not say that the laws of the GDR are out of effect. Schabowski said that goes into effect right now. He said: "Immediately" The party is always right, that is what we learned in school. You too, right? The embassy refugees were let out too. I am just going to say: "Prague" That was a generous gesture. How about you make a generous gesture? We adhere to the laws of the GDR. Opposed to the Polit Bureau? You don't have to argue with us. We'll come back, really. We have children here. When the new travel regulations are given to us we will inform you, but that is not going to happen tonight. And now I ask you to leave the border area, or else... Or else? You'll shoot? Don't shoot. Nobody will shoot here. Let's go. Come on, we are leaving. [Distant] Open it! Open it! We'll come back, you can count on that. What happend to our country? Yes? Werner! Do we have a cabel problem? No, joke aside. I thought you'd call back. Yeah... just the right time for jokes, Kummer. You know... I really don't want to pester you, but I don't know what to do. And we are having a part?! What am I supposed to tell my men? They expect orders from me. Dammit! We are working on a solution here! You have to wait and take on your responsibility. Yes... of course...Yes, Sir, Comrade General. Will you call me back? Werner, please. Hello? My ministry knows nothing about this. They say you all are responsible. We have silence too. The Ministry of State Security sees itself unable to give an order. That is the situation, Comrades. They can't leave us hanging. They won't leave us hanging. I don't understand it. If they all want to cross the border, we'll need at least two weeks of training. And we need completely new customs regulations, I don't know what to tell my boys. Have a little patience Comrades. Patience? He is talking about Patience. Have they ever left us hanging before? A single time? That wouldn't have happened with Mielke. With Honecker neither. Oh, really? And what about the Prague embassy? Huh? First they let them blackmail themselves and then they parade the people through the entire GDR, just so that it looks like they have everything under control. What are the Comrades supposed to do? When the people run away like there is no food here. That is a higher power! You always have an explanation, Uli. Huh? For everything, you have a political explanation. And I am so damn tired of it. You are right about that, Peter. And what is your explanation, Comrade?! [Everyone arguing over one another] (Uli is demanding an explanation) All of you get up. Get up! Hold hands. That is an order! We have to get through this together. Sit. And what do we do if the situation out there escalates? Harald? Could you stop smoking in here for once? It is making me sick. You know what makes me sick, Harald? The way you treat my cookies and that you are not saying anything. Are you not the commanding officer? Could you all come? Now tell us what we are supposed to do, Harald. Let's stay calm. Melitta what are you doing here? I was scared something would happen. I am on duty. You can't do anything stupid now. Axel, do you understand? Melitta. What are the Comrades supposed to think of me? The people are peaceful. Really, Axel. Go home. Please, Melitta. Definitely not. Problems? Huh? No. Everything alright. I already explained to her that she needs a visa. And? Do you have one, mam? Border area is prohibited are. You should know that. Anything else? Of course. This is a nonauthorized demonstration. The Comrades of the police are responsible for that. We are saved. Achim. Finally. So you know? Of course. I am so relieved. And? What "and"? What instructions do you all have? Why us? Well, we thought you all... No... we thought you all. I can't believe this is happening. Do they want to test us? Or was Schabowski just making a joke? Yeah, it is all just a joke. It's just that no one can laugh about it. Harald? What are you all going to do? Well. It is a demonstration, that is your responsibility. They are standing in front of your border. In your district. When your people up there mess up, we are supposed to take the blame for you all? Achim, we have to do something. But we can't without orders. Thank you, Achim. You really helped me. Harald! Dammit, Harald! Now you put the blame on me? Great! Excellent Comrade! What am I supposed to do, Comrade? Yeah, what are you supposed to do Comrade? and what am I supposed to do?! Dammit. Shit. Looks like we are in this together. I just pictured that. Achim. Yeah? We need an idea on how to get out of this. We could do this: I call my boss and say "We can't leave the Comrades at the border hanging". And I call my boss and say that we can't leave the Comrades of the police hanging they need our help. Achim. I am already feeling better. Me too, Harald. Wait a second. What was the idea? You get your orders. I get my orders and then... we'll see from there. Achim Harald Signature. Schaefer here from the Bornholmer street. Comrade Colonel, the Comrades of the police were here, they need our help. What do we care about the police? But they are responsible for us. Are you completely insane?! I am responsible for you. That's what I mean. They need orders, and we need orders too. that's how it is, right? Comrade Colonel? Please. I can't pull orders out of thin air, Schaefer. And what am I supposed to tell my men? Listen to your intuition. I can't tell you more. Harald. Could you sign the dog? The Veterinarian refuses to come here this late. Now, I don't know how to get the health certificate. Harald, can you call them? First... First the signature. Do you think I don't have better things to do? Are you completely insane? You are the boss here. Get rid of the dog. You are putting the dog away and then you are going down to the gate. I think it has diarrhea. No surprise with all this racket going on. Put it on the toilet, or somewhere, dammit. I don't want to see that thing here anymore. And then you come down to the gate. And then? Uli! Put up the dog! Alright. I am on my way. Put it in the holding cell. A signature. [Everyone] Open the gate! [Chant] Open the gate! Everything alright, Hoffmann? What is going to happen, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel? We will see Water throwers, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel? Possibly. Tanks? Come here. You can lay down and sleep a bit. Until Uli comes back. Down. That's good. You need to stay here. Good. Look. Like this Yeah. I have to do this sweetie. [Chant] Open the Gate! There is no point! Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. I am here like ordered. Get me a chair. Are you not feeling well, Harald? No. A table is better I want to talk to the people. What? You can't be serious. Do you have a better idea? You lock up the dog, but want to talk to them? What kind of nonsense is that? Get a table This is nonsense. [Chant] Open the gate! Good evening, Comrade Officer. Good evening. I would like to visit my daughter in West Berlin. Do you have a visa? It is just a visit. Please show me your visa. I'll come back. You don't want to understand me, do you? Is there a problem, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel? But the Comrade Schabowski said that... I know what the Comrade Schabowski said. Do you think I am stupid? No, I just wanted to visit my daughter. Did you not hear him? You are in the border area without permission. Unbelievable. Tries it by acting stupid. Shhh. Don't get nervous. [Everyone] Open the Gate! Let the woman to her daugher! Secure table. Citizen... Citizen of the German Democratic Republic. It is not possible [Crowd] Liar! to allow you to leave here and now. For that you need a permit from the responsible station of the German Peoples Police. They are open tomorrow. From eight on. Please leave the border area. Tomorrow will be another day. [Chant] Open the gate! Wiese. Hold [Chant] Open the gate! Can you come down here? Did something happen, Harald? On my way. I can't do it anymore. Thank you, Wolfgang. You know what my son said at breakfast recently? "Dad, we have a world view without having looked at the world" Of course,I put him in his place. but... ...now the party is saying it too. [Distant Chant] Open the gate! A lot has happend in the last months, don't you think? Yeah... a lot happend. But we never talk about it. Do you want me to take your confession? If they really open the border... That would be a lot of work. Do you really think that? Harald! I have helped to build all of this. The border is my life. Mine too, Harald. 40 years without war in europe, that is because of us. Yeah... but Socialism is right. It is not a hollow promise. No, Harald. Of course not. We stand on the right side. Yes, but did you think we would be in a situation like this? We have to talk about that, Harald! Hey! You! The news said that the border is open. Is that right? Can the East Germans come over now? Do you see any? We can here that there is something going on. Can you not hear it? As you can see everything is like always. You can go to bed. If they knew, huh, Harald? Wolfgang? Call from the other side. What happend? They don't know what to do. Operative Management Center. Comrade Colonel. I know that I don't have a right to, but I need to know what I am supposed to do. I really need a decision, Comrade Colonel. I am starting to get angry. I have said everything there is to say, Schaefer. The people can't be told off anymore. They are getting more aggressive. Then make them calm down, dammit. I tried to, but... How many are there anyway? I don't know how many, but there are very many, Comrade Colonel. Many?! What kind of stupid answer is that? You can do it. What? What are we supposed to do? What are you talking about? You wait for orders, and then you will execute it. It is that simpel, Schaefer. But there are no orders, Comrade Colonel. There are no orders! You are supposed to hold position. Hold position! Did you understand that? Did you understand that, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel? That is an order. Yes, Sir. Hold position. First, get an overview. And don't panic. Yes, Sir. Comrade Colonel. Get an overview. Yeah. How many are that, Harald? I don't know. A thousand? Or ten thousand? Probably the entire city. And how many men do we have? You know that. Sixteen. Sixteen... I have another two. Well, we are saved then. Eighteen... Eighteen. We need to prepare for the worst. Micha! I made some sandwiches for you all. Micha... What are you doing with the rifle? How can you think about food now? Can you not see what is going on? Customs is not a fighting force. But we have to prepare. Michael. You have a wife and children. Yes, that's right, and I am standing here for them. Can you not take care of your family problems at home? Someone that lives in the apartments for singles should stay out of this. We are just customs... Ilona, leave Micha alone! Mom. You are embarrassing me. I just made a few sandwiches. Two men at the gate, two to secure the Office buildings, two facing the enemy on the bridge, two on the roof. Hold up. Oh, really? Is this the playground? Or what? What do you think Micha? Well, that is an important question, Burkhard. We are not at war, Burkhard. The mob is standing outside! Thank you. Better than nothing. Thank you. So beautiful and so lonely? No boyfriend? Sadly he is on duty. Then he can't protect you. You have to protect him from himself. Peter. Can you order your student officers here? If I take them out of the gardens the entire area is without control. They are standing on our doorstep. Do you think someone will climb over the wall in the gardens? You can always just say what is not possible, Peter. It is noticeable. Yeah, you are really negative. I have noticed that for a long time. And I want that you say something about that. We are sitting in shit up to our necks, and you are making stupid comments?! Your blathering makes me want to throw up. I am the idiot here now? When the Comrades up there fuck up?! You are such a stupid asshole! Harald! Did you hear what he said? He said asshole! Did you hear that?! Just shut up, Uli! That is not what this is about right now! Ohh, really? Do you decide what this is about? You of all people. You who always hides behind his mother and the entirety of customs. Leave my mother out of this! Silence! Silence! Silence! Silence! Silence! It is too loud to think in here! Ohh! The boss is thinking! Yes, he is thinking. And when can we expect a result? Silence! Harald, you really have to. Silence, Uli. Silence. Uli, Silence. You have to make a decision. That is how it is. I have had enough. Now, Comrades. We can start. I don't know, Burkhard... Have I given you the order? This is the real thing, Harald. Two men with AK stand directly at the gate. And with the "Hot Lily." A single shot into the crowd. And we will have respect again immediately. You want to shoot at them?! Without warning? Burkhard! What are we here for? For the protection of our national borders! With everything we have! Have you forgotten that?! If we don't stand our ground now... we are done. Up to now not a single one has gotten into the border area. That means, we can't shoot! Wrong, Harald! We have to prevent that someone can get in! If we put AK marksmen at the gate we are provoking the people! We provoke?! Yes! We provoke?! Yeah! Do you even know where you stand?! Yes! We have helped to build all of this. Think about '61. Stop with '61. Turn around! That was a greate accomplishment. Harald, do you remember how they threw rocks at us, on Ebert street? With rocks. This big! And back then we swore to protect this border to the last drop of blood. To the last drop of blood. And now... I will bring Lily into position. Just in case, Harald. You... put that thing back into the safe. Understood? I hope you know what you are doing. Now, you assholes. What do we do now? I will protect you, my boy. Do you want me to turn the light off? Harald? Important. Diplomatic relations. Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, the ambassador of Mozambique. I told him he can't get through, but he doesn't want to leave. He wants to enter the GDR. [Inaudible] Mr. Ambassador, I am sorry, but I have to ask you to turn around. We can't get you through over there. These are special circumstances tonight. Diplomats all over the world can travel freely. No special circumstances. Yes. This is an unintended consequence of the press conference given by Comrade Schabowski. Who is Comrade Schabowski? He is making problems? Yeah... I mean. No! I...I...I mean. We don't want to cause you problems. I hope you understand. It is... How am I supposed to say this? It is caused something we cant influence. Can I please have your name and rank? And also of this Comrade Schabowski. You can not get through. Please understand. The road is blocked. Nothing can happen. Comrade Ambassador, I can't do anything about it. It is chaos down there! Chaos? I don't know chaos. In Maputo, the street is always congested. Sorry...Sorry. Still chaos? This is a dead end. No one can get through here. Closed Burkhard, this is your job. I'll take care of it. Harald, I'll take care of it. Let me through. Citizen of the German Democratic Republic. This is a diplomatic matter. In this car is a friend from Mozambique. You know how close we are with the black continent. That is not where we want to go. Please don't endanger our friendship with the peoples of Africa. What friendship? The ambassador has to enter the GDR. And we want to leave! Please clear the road. Ohh look! The state force! No one is listening to you anymore. Hey! Let's make some space. Please make way. 1st German TV, we have a few questions. No interviews A short interview, please. Why is the border still closed? What are you waiting for? Whas I not clear enough? [Everyone] No! It is really simple. We are waiting here forever... and they... Look at him! Look at him in his uniform! Like a father that locks up his kids. Grounded, huh, Dad? With 45 you are still treated like a child. I am over it. [Everyone Agrees] I am so tiered of it. Let us through! We will come back! Just an hour, we just want to take a look. What are we supposed to do in a huge city? Am I going to sleep on the street? Let me through. Hey! What is up? Are you scared of us? We are totally peaceful. [Somone from the Crowd] Let her go! Wiese, Hoffmann, Interviene. Get the man out of there. You, you, you too. The rest stays with me, secure border. [Inaudible screaming] It's toppling. It's toppling, Harald. It's toppling. Get it together. Burkhard! Harald! Let us bring Lily into position. Please. Operative Management Center Schaefer here again. Bornholmer Street. Is there any new information, Comrade Colonel? So you want information, and you think I have some, but am not passing it along? That is not what I mean. But I can't leave my men without instructions any longer. Yeah...listen to me carefully Schaefer. Our Comrade Erich Mielke who, as you know, is no longer... allowed to be in office called the Comrade Egon Krenz, half an hour ago. He told him about the situation at the border, but dear Mr. Krenz, General Secretary of our party, leader of our state, Chairmen of our nation....national defense comittee, knew about nothing. About nothing. So our Comrade Erich Mielke talked straight. You know he is, Schaefer. "Egon", he said. "You have to make a decision. Fast. The border is in trouble" [Imitating an answer] "A decision? What do you mean?" Dear Mr. Krenz saw himself unable to make a decision. More informaton Schaefer? You can have it! In the Bonn House of representatives the representatives stood up 15 minutes ago and sung the BRD national anthem. [Singing Mockingly] "Unity, and Justice, and freedom for the german fatherland?" They are celebrating their victory. And what are we supposed to do? Do you want cognac? Heinz! Get the others. Fast! I'll pour it through the telephone. Comrade Colonel. Humor is not your strong suit, huh, Schaefer? You take things like that with humor. We really need a decision. The people out there will overrun us, if we don't do anything soon! I am dying laughing! Are there orders to shoot? Are we supposed to shoot? What did Colonel Kummer say? I have to report Comrades. There are still no orders. I am making a decision now. I am calling all off-duty men here, right now. That is only allowed when there is an alarm, Harald. You don't have the authority to do that. I don't have the authority to do anything. Not even that. To secure the border with eighteen men and wait for orders like an idiot, that is what I am authorized to do! Do you want to take command? According to service regulations, only the officer in the Operative Management Center can call the men here. Harald, you know the rules. What does your service regulation say when a million people are standing at the border? What does it say then? What? What do you say to that Peter Arnt? I don't want to make a wrong impression. Aha. Micha? I am just customs. What am I supposed to write? [Sporadic demand to open the gate] [Chant] Open the gate! We will come back! Leave! Comrades. Sometimes you have to get over your fear. Kummer Comrade Colonel. I have ordered all available men here. You did what? I have ordered all... Without my orders? I know Comrade Colonel. I am not allowed to do that. That can have terrible consequences Schaefer. I know, Comrade Colonel. Stay on the phone. Yes, Sir. You shut your mouth, understood? Yes, Sir. Yes? Kummer here, Comrade General. The General! I just received a report from Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer. The commanding officer at the Guest-Bornholmer Strasse. The situation is starting to get serious. So he says. Can the Comrade even really asses that, Kummer? I think so, Werner. Maybe he is just scared. We can't allow mistakes right now. The man should calm down. Comrade General! Schafer here Guest-Bornholmer Street, listen to what is going on here! [Chant] Open the gate! We will come back! Hello? Comrade Colonel? They don't want to accept the reality. [Chant] Open the gate! We will come back! Comrade Colonel? Schaefer? I have orders. Orders? You will do the following: those that seem extremely provokative, you isolate from the crowd. You let them leave. You put a stamp on the picture. You don't let them back in. If others push through with them, then you don't put the stamp on the picture, but in the back. In the back. Do you understand? Those can get back in, the others can't, their citizenship is revoked. Isolate agitators and revoke citizenship. Let people that pushed through with them back in. That is correct. You'll see Schaefer. First, we let some pressure out of the kettle and then the steam will dissipate by itself. We'll make it. Keep your head up. Thank you. Comrade Colonel, thank you. [Both] We have orders! We have orders! [Chant] We have orders! [Chant] Open the gate! We will come back! I am sorry Erich. You find the agitators. You take them and bring them to the door. You escort them from the door to the passport check. And you put a stamp in the passport. But, Harald. How do I know who gets the stamp where? Burkhard. You tell Uli who the agitators are. Uli. You pass it along to Christoph. And you tell Juergen. No, Harald. I don't think that will work. Why not? Telephone Game. In the end you always understand something else than what was said in the beginning. Then we will do it differently. Everyone works for themselves. From emigration to the passport check. That's how we'll do it Comrades. Make way. [Everyone] Let us out. How long do you want us to stand around here? I have waited for 28 years. It is enough! Why are you yelling? [German version of "Itsy bitsy spider"] On the wall, On the lookout, sits a little bedbug on the wall, on the lookout, sits a little bedbug, It can really boogie, see the bedbug boogie. On the wall, on the lookout, sits a little bedbug. On the wall, on the lookout, sits a little bedbu On the wall, on the lookout sits a little bedbu It can really boog, see the bedbu boog. On the wall, on the lookout, sits a little bedbu Then come on. Follow me. Let's go, you can leave. [Background] And what about us? You can leave. Go! Follow me. I wan to leave too. And what about me? You stay where you are. Come Wait at the passport check. He, on the picture. She, in the back. Go left. That way Is this a dream? Excuse me, you are the first ones to cross the border this evening. Do you have family in West Berlin? No, we don't. We just want to take a look. What is going to be your first stop? Kuhdamm, probably. If we find it. Comrade Officer, please. Please, Comrade Officer. I haven't seen my daughter... I haven't seen my daughter in two years. I...I just want one day... one hour. Follow me. You two, follow me. [Woman continues pleading] Comrade Officer.... Here. Stand in line. This way. [TV] Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen. You have to be careful when using superlatives, they dull easily. But tonight we can risk using one. This 9th of November is a historical day. The GDR announced to the public that their borders are open for everyone. The gates in the wall are wide open. You would like that, wouln't you? [TV] East and West Germany.... Let us through. Make way. Will you take me with you? Stand back. Stand back! Who gets to leave, and who doesn't? Is this selection, or what? This is a border violation. I hope you know that. Stand back! I said stand back! Stand back! Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, the alarm group is assembled. We worked all these years for this. So that for every citizen there is two of us. And then you bring me ten men? The others did not make it through. So, Comrades. Our job is to protect this border with everything we have. Use of your firearm only for self defense. Is that clear? [Chant] Open the gate! We will come back! Get out of here! Do I know you? Dammit, Melitta! Do you even remember why you stand here, Axel? Because there are people like you! Comrade Hoffmann, go back into the guard booth. Go and man the gate opener. Stand back. [Chant] Open the gate! Open the gate! Open the gate! Stand back! How? Did you not understand me? I said stand back! You can see I can't you idiot. Don't touch me again! I am not gonna let you piss on me again. That time is over, when you took someone from the street because you didn't like us. I'll blow you away, you idiot! And put us in prison for nothing! Only blackmail and threaten. That is what you can do. You messed with me all this time! Jens! Jens! Comrade Sergeant. Go to reinforce the passport control immediately. He attacked me. Go! This is cowardice. This is an order! [Chant] No violence! They shoot at their own people! Hey! Citizen! Their own people! You can leave right now, through that door. Did you understand me? You can leave! Will you take me with you? Please take me with you! Close the line! That was close Hoffmann. Let them in. I can't. What do you mean? "I can't"? That is insubordination. That is my girlfriend. I can't also take care of your girlfriend! Harald. How many more are we supposed to let out? 300? 500? 1000? This is unbelievable! Open it! You can hear it yourself, they are all yelling. We can't let them all out. You know the orders, Uli. What are we doing? We are executing orders, Uli. We are tearing down what we build with our own hands... Dammit, Harald! This is our border! I don't have time for that. Open it! Please, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. Damn... This is going to have consequences, Hoffmann. You can be sure of that. Take your hands off of there. Are you reuniting with old friends? No... So you are just being given a nice welcome? Yeah... it is not valid. What?! Why is it not valid? Because I told you so. I want to know why! Don't argue with me! We were just taking a look! Here, completely offical. Here is the stamp. Our children are at home! You can enter again. Just not your husband. This can't be true! But we are together. We have our instructions. What kind of harassment his this? First they dont let you out... You! You want to sperate me from my husband? What kind of humans are you?! What is going on here? Jens is going crazy. He is not letting my husband back in! I am going to take a look at the situation. You passport please. What is there to take a look at? This is not a Zoo. Passport. What is going on? Please come with me. Secure. Let's go. And what about me? First, calm down. I understand you, but you have to understand us too. What am I supposed to understand?! My children don't even know that we are here. They are sleeping. Why did you leave then? Shit. But all of this was offical, with passport and everything. Why did you come to the border tonight? We just wanted to take a look and... suddenly your men took my husband with them. And then both of us were allowed to cross. I couldn't let him go by himself. You can go. You can enter again. My husband? Your husband too. Follow me, please. Let him in. This is against the principle, this is againt everything Let him in. No. No! You do what I tell you to do. You let that man in. You stand back! I'll crush you like a bedbug. Thank You. Jens! Will you come back? This is bullshit. This is... This is bull... Please Comrades, help me. I am at my wits' end. You have to make a decision now, Harald. And what am I supposed to decide, Mr. Security Officer, what? Dammit, say something! I could close the border completely. Stop the valve solution. I could order the student officers from the gardens and we secure the border at the gate. Unless the citizen provoke, or attack. And then I will open fire immediatley. If you order that, Harald. I will get Lily immediately. That is going to be a blood bath! What is happening to us? Harald? Do you have a cigarette for me? Everyone get down to the gate. Now! What? Go on! Get out of here! What are you going to do, Harald? I want to talk to the Mr. Officer. I finally want to be heard. Mr. Officer. Mr. Officer. I want to go to the other part of the city once. Where my daughter lives. I...I...I have been a teacher for 30 years. And educate the children in our country. And I can't explain to them anymore why they can't travel. While their friends leave the country through Hungary and Czechoslovakia. What are being punished for?! If we stay here, and we want to stay here. [Background] Exactly! What are we being punished for? Is this your kind of politics? For the people that go to work here everyday. And do something everyday so that things keep moving forward in our country. Let me to my daughter for one hour! Just one hour! One hour! Do you not have any children? Do you not have a heart? Comrade Lieutenant. Secure the investigation building and all other barracks. March. Alarm Group, follow me! Doubletime, march! Please. Open the gate. Open the gate. Open the gate. Step back, march! Come, please. Are you comming? Come, please. Come on. Wait here. [Chant] Open gate! Come. Is that what you wanted? I'll go and report, huh? Comrade Colonel. I have today, on the 9th of November 1989, without an order, opend the border. For 28 years I guarded it like my own child. Protected it from border violaters, agents, and agitators. When the party gave me its hand, I took it. I studied. And with scientific care, practiced the teachings of marxisim. Here, at this, our border. Even health problems did not stop me to justify the trust given to me everyday. But today... No, Comrades. I will not defend myself here. I acted like I had to. And now it you who has to judge what I did. It is you. I will call back. [Music] Only by fighting can you achive a lot, but if you hesitate far from the goal. [Music] laughing comes the next and wins the game. Get it together. [Music] Only on the minute it always depends, wether one can understand and comprehend it, [Music] one stands beside it and never understands, and the other come and sees and knows not how. Comrade, Colonel. Is that you? [Music] Only on the minute it always depends, sometimes the fate of a people depends on it. It is alright my boy. Write your report. [Music]So don't just think but act too, because on the minute it always depends [Musik] Just on the minute it always depends. Harald. The dog owner is here. What are we supposed to do? Let him go, Uli. But we don't have a health certificate yet, Harald. Ohh, Uli. Give it to me. Now. Run. Your owner is outside. Take care of it, Uli. I can't do it, Harald. Life goes on, Uli. I argued for a peaceful solution from the beginning. So that we could prove to the entire world, that peace is of the highest importance to us. You can believe me. It was not an easy decision.... Thank You! You are just a human too! What? The West stinks. Sissy. What are you going to do now? Celebrate! Dear viewers, as you can see, the people are pouring over the border without any hinderance. Apperantly the border... You did good. Whas easy, wasn't it? Seems like that was it. What do you mean? The GDR. Hello Hello, Lily. Morning Greta. You are pretty late today. [Radio] The Polit Bureau of the General Ministry of the SED published the following today: Did you forget the bowl examination? Hurry up, Harald. Greta? I opend the border last night. I opend the border last night. That is not something to joke about, Harald.
