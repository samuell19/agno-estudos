What do you call it? - A Cosmopolitan. Compliments of Big Harold over there. - Oh man, all these cute guys, I gotta get hit on, by that? - Sorry about that. - Hi, I'm Harold. - Hi Harold. - You look so uncomfortable. Don't worry, I just cameout of the closet myself. - Well, congratulationsHarold, good luck with that. You maybe should have stayed in, but look, thanks for the cosmotician, but I'm really with this guy here. This is my man, my boyfriend, my dude. Many years, together. Oh my God. - Tony?- Brian. - What are you doing here? - I'm having a drink, Imean I was passing by, and I was thirsty, so I ordered-- - Yeah, me too.- And he gave me this thing. I got this, I don't knowwhat the hell this is. - Not a beer. Wow, a lot of guys in here, huh? - I just noticed that. - Must be like a fraternity reunion. - I was just thinking that. - Yes. - Yes, fraternity, definitely. - Oh shit. - What? - What is she doing here?- Who? - I gotta find the bathroom. - It's right over there. - Okay. - I mean, I think it's over there. - [Sarah] Let's party girls. - Hi. - Hey, Brian.

Sorry. - Oh, okay. - What are you ladies doing here? - We're here for Steveand Michael's anniversary. Don't worry though, we won'ttell Tony we saw you here. - You won't have to. - [Sarah] What did you just say? - Nothing. - I don't see Steve or Michael. - Oh, that's strange. - I wonder where they are? - They're probably goingat it, like cats in heat. (rock music) - When are you gonna stopwith this ridiculous charade? Just admit, you're not readyfor a serious relationship. - It's not that. I can't explain it. Something, something happened to me. It's got nothing to do with you. - It has nothing to do with me. That's the problem. We have to go now, we are late. Our friends are waiting toshare our joyous occasion. - Fine. You're not wearing that are you? - You gave this to melast Valentine's Day. I'm wearing this for you,what's wrong with it? - It's too queen. - That's it, if you don't straighten, unstraighten yourself right now, pack your bags and get out. - Don't be such a heterophobe. Boy. - I'm really sorry, myfiance's out here and I just... - Let me guess, she doesn'tknow that you're gay. - Gay? Me? No. No, I mean I'm not gay, at least I wasn't. Look, I'm working it out okay. - I love newbies. - Oh my God she's coming in here. What are you doing in here? Get out of here. - Don't worry, she's fine. (Tony stuttering) - Stop, stop that. (women talking over each other) - Okay, okay, so just a fling. - Love's crossed. - My brother comes to this bar sometimes. - Honey, I'm not a big fan of surprises. - Really? I didn't know your brother was gay. - Me neither, till I foundhim in bed with my boyfriend. - Jesus, would you stop? - I think we're interrupting something. - Mellow out. - I'm curious, shh, shh, shh, shh. - Whoa, those are mine. Those are mine, those are mine. - Is that my brother? That might be my brother. - Okay, okay. She's gone, she's left the bathroom, so I'm gonna just do that too. - Don't worry, you're safe. They already left. - Thanks buddy. - What the hell was I thinking? Did I buy this? - Yes. - And this? - Yes. - The gayness of them overwhelms me. - We have to go. Just pick any fricking coat. - If you're gonna yell atme like some drama queen, maybe I just won't go. - You know what, fine. Don't go. - What are you doing? - Well, I can't go by myself. I will look like a total loser. (soft jazz music) - I totally dated those two guys, but they never kissed me like that. - I'll get us some shots. - Tequila. - Some guy offered todo it off of his butt. - Potty shot. - Hey wait, is that Tonycoming out of the bathroom? - I doubt it. Tony is completely and utterly homophobic. - Oh, he's afraid of houses? That's gotta be hard. - Oh there you are. Why did you run away so quickly? - Would you just give me-- - Tony. Did you just come out of the bathroom door with this guy? - No. - Yes. - Okay fine, what, a coupleof girls go into the bathroom, nobody says anything. But two guys, and it's a big problem. - What are you doing in a gay bar? - Ah sweetie, thank youfor letting me borrow him. - Nothing happened. Could you just please? If you just would give us a second? Sarah, he's lying. - Tony, what are you doing here? Are those Prada? - Yeah, would you look at that? You know I must have switchedshoes with Steve at work. - You take your shoes off at work? Forget it. What are you doing here? - Here? What am I doing here? Well, what are any of us doing here? That's really the questionthat you want to know, because, what are we all doing hurtling through spaceon this big blue rock. - No, no, no Tony, what are you doing here, in this bar? I came here tonight to celebratewith Steve and Michael, who I thought you couldn'tstand because they're gay, and here you are. Of course it's no wonder you think I'm prettier than Megan Fox, you can't tell the bloodydifference, can you? I'm as naive as Laura is. No offense Laura. - What? - Okay see, my therapist thinks that-- - When have you had a therapist? - I only went once, okay? And listen, Oprah seemed to think that everybody should be in therapy, because it's veryimportant for the human-- - Oh, Oprah. This is too much for me. Kathy, Laura, I'm leaving. - Okay I'm coming. I just want to say goodnight to Brian. - Laura, just give it up. - Hey, I know you haven't called, but I figured, you probably don't have a lot of minutes on your plan, so we can totally text. I have unlimited text. Or I could get a family plan. I mean, it's not like the come over and check for a ring, or anything, unless you don't want a family. Do you not want a family? That's like really important to me. But, you can let me know, okay? But I hope it's a yes. Okay, I have to go. My friend's having a hard night. Good to see you. Bye. Bye. Bye Tony. - Yeah. Cosmo. Could I get that drink? (upbeat techno music) (men talking over each other in alley) - Ah, what's up faggot? (men taunting and harassing Tony) - Hey, where you goin' gay boy? - Wanna suck on this? - Gay boy, where's the bar? - [Unknown Voiceover]Look at this queer, Ray. - Go queer. - Dude, that is the worstgame I've ever seen you play. You ran 'em through like a fag. What the hell's the matter with you? Hey, you all right? - No. Not really. Danny, you're my best man, right? - Yeah. - So I could tell you anything? - Yeah, man. What's up? Come on talk to me. Would you look at this? Everywhere I go. Filthy queers, man. What's up? - Nothin'. - I know, Tony and me. Sorry yes, Tony and I, we'll sort out our problems, I'm sure. But thank you. I've got to go. I'll see you tomorrow. Love you. - So, you haven't talkedto me in two days, not that I'm complaining about that but, not for nothin', why are you telling mymom about our problems? - How did you know I wastalking to your mother? - Well, I know that Lauradoesn't correct your English. - You're funny now. (soft jazz music) Are you sure you don't wantto give these to mister abs? - Nothing happened with that guy. - Well, what were youdoing in that bar, Tony? - I was doing what you told me to do, I was trying to be moreunderstanding of the gays. I was trying to get to know them. - Well, I didn't mean getting to know them in the biblical sense, in the restroom of a gay bar. - Look, I'm sorry but, nothing happened. Okay? Five years we're together. You don't think that you would know if I was a homosexual or not? - Well you must admit, it'sbeen a bit confusing of late. - You're telling me. Listen, tomorrow, Christmas day, my parents' house. Please, tell me that you're gonna be able to do this with me. - Of course I will. - Thanks.

Why does everybody wantto butcher the language? - Uh, Tony? Yo Tony. Hey kid. What exactly are you doing? - I thought I'd help with the dinner. - Who are you kidding? You can't even make toast. - Needs truffle oil. - Ah. - Actually, he made agourmet Chicken Marsala meal the other night. - Really? I didn't even know he could cook. - Turns out there's a few things that we both didn't know about Tony. - Like what? - I think I know my Tony pretty well. Hey, what happened the other night? - That's our business Mom. - Oh, what did my Tony do wrong, Sarah? - Yeah, give us all the dirt on Rambo. I'd ask if you caught himwatching internet porn, but we all know that Tonystill thinks that WWW means World Wrestling... - Yeah, good one. So why is it that they automatically assume this was my fault? - Well sweetie, it wasn't my fault I run into you at a gay bar. - Ran into you at a gay bar? - This is getting good. - You heard that? - I hear everything. - Oh my God. - So, Sarah, what were you doing at a gay bar? - Well, me and my friends-- - My friends and I. - Sorry, Mary you're correct. My friends and I, we went to celebrate with my friend Steve andhis boyfriend Michael, for their anniversary. - Oh well, at least somebody'scelebrating anniversaries. - More importantly,what were you doing at a place where they sing and wear chaps? - You know what Mom, thisturkey looks delicious. I think we should eat. We should definitely eat. - I did not raise my son tohang out with no fruit loops. - Any fruit loops, otherwiseit's a double negative. - Mary, what the hell are you doing? You just find out that yourson's hanging out in a gay bar, and you're worried about the floor? - Okay, this is how Ideal with things, okay? I clean. It's easier to clean a floor, than change my son's sexual orientation. - Ohhhhh, no no no no no no no no, no son of mine is gay. I mean, look at him. He was all-state in highschool for Chrissakes, and get that thing off ya. - Okay, honey, we loveyou, even if you are gay. - But, you aren't. - Well what if I was? - Uh uh uh, you know I don'tlike them theoreticals. - No, no, you know what Pop, you're gonna answer this one. What if I was gay? - Actually it's what if I were gay? Not was, the rule in English-- - [Tony and Sarah] Stop correcting us. - I'm an English teacher, it's what I do. - But, you are not gay. - Oh, maybe I am. - You're gonna standthere and argue with me? I mean, 'cause the last time I checked, this was my house, which makes me king, which means I make all the rules. And I say, that you arenot gay, and that's final. - Yeah, well maybe I should just go, king. - Well, maybe you should. - This is so going on Youtube. - Stephanie, please cut that out. - You would put your ownson out on Christmas? - I ain't the one throwing him out. It's his idea. - Don't use the wordain't, it's ludicrous. - Oh, what the hell's ludicrous mean? - It means ridiculous. - I am really proud of you. Not for being gay, but for knowing what ludicrous means. - Which you're being right now, Pop. Come on Sarah. Come on. - I'm sorry Mary. - You sit down.

I refuse to make the same mistake that Liza Minnelli, and her mother made. I'm not gonna marry a guythat's on the down low. I'm sorry, the wedding's off. - I'm sorry about the whole gift thing. I just forgot. - It's Christmas. You could have made some sort of effort. You look like a total slob. - Who cares? Nobody's here. - I'm here.

I'm sorry about what happened to you. You're not gonna start wearingmy dresses now, are you? - Get outta here. God, I know it's been along time since I've prayed. Actually, it's been about 10 years. Are you testing me? Am I being punished for something? Because I feel like you'retrying to teach me a lesson here, but I always thought thatit was wrong in your eyes, to be gay. Now whatever's going on with me, I just wish you couldmake me normal again. I'm sorry. I didn't mean normal, I just meant normal for me. Anyway, any help you couldsend my way would be, really welcome. Amen. (knocking on door) Really? - What? - Nothing, never mind just, what are you doing here? - I heard what happened. - Yeah, I got, mugged. - Yeah, I got mugged too. Same spot, a couple of years ago. - You know Steve, I reallyowe you an apology man, I've been a real asshole. I gotta tell you man, I am definitely not thesame man I used to be. - Well that's ironic, because neither am I. - How's that? - For one thing, I'm notwith Michael anymore. - Oh man, I'm sorry. He was a real catch. What happened? - Just not talking to him anymore. - Huh, wow, I mean there are a lot of really cute guys out there. - Yeah, that's not gonna work either. - What do mean? - Well Tony, it's obvious. You've been hiding yourfeelings for a really long time. - Actually-- - No no no no, just let me, you know you're finallydiscovering who you are and, well it turns out, I'm not who I thought I was. Tony, I'm straight. - Straight? So you mean like, straight. - Like, an arrow. - So what? You've been pretending tobe gay this whole time? - Just happened recently. - How recently? Don't worry, buddy. We're gonna fix this. - I hope so, 'cause for the first time I now know that I'm in love with Michael. I really am in love with him and, I miss him so much. - So, you haven't changed? - No, I did. I just love him anyway. And now there's nothing in the way, not even sexuality. I can't picture myselfbeing with anyone else for the rest of my life, man or woman. - Yeah, I know what you mean. So your folks, are they okay with you know, it? - My father hasn't talked tome for close to two years. He's the one who wantedme to play football. I hated it. Except for the locker room. No, I really wanted to play soccer. - Yeah, me too. My dad always said it was a pussy sport. I never told anybody that. - Are you breaking up with me? - We're not dating. - Brian, I think I finally understand. You're bisexual aren't you? - Yes Laura, I'm bisexual. I have sex with gay men, and straight men. - I knew it. - Oh, good, you're all here. Listen, something reallyweird is going on, and we're not sure what, but something happened,and well now I'm gay. - And now I'm straight. - I think I'm bulimic, I justkeep forgetting to throw up. - Guys, don't be ridiculous. - No, Sarah it's true. - Yeah right. - Yeah, what are you doing? - I'm just trying to proveto her that I'm straight. - Yeah well, could youmaybe prove it another way? - You never kissed melike that when we dated. Were you really flirting withme at the Christmas party? - Yeah, in fact that's when it started. I remember I felt a little different. - Yeah, you know I rememberfeeling a little different too, but I just thought that I drank too much. Wow, I was really a dick, huh? - [All] Yeah. - Yeah, you kept insulting me, and I remember I wished youwere gay to teach you a lesson. - Yeah, and I wishedthat you were straight. - That doesn't explain what happened. - Maybe all you have todo is wish it undone. - Come on Laura get real. - No, she's got a point. It's no harm in trying right? - Okay, I wish you were straight. No, I mean I wish you were straight, but like uncomfortable watchingOlympic wrestling straight. - Yeah yeah, exactly, andI wish that you were gay, but not just gay. I'm talking like super-gay,I mean like Village People, cheerleader, hairdresser, gay. Well let's test it out. Nothing, man we really have tofigure out how this happened. - Could have been the angelornament at the boss' house. - What are you talking about? - Well, at the party whenSteve wished that Tony was gay, Tony wished that Steve wasstraight, that angel lit up. It was pretty. - And you didn't tell us about this, why? - Oh, I thought you'dthink I was an idiot. - Well, if the shoe fits. - The angel. - The angel. (upbeat jazzy music) Boss, boss? - What's wrong? - Where's the angel? - Not that it's any of your business, but she stayed at her place tonight. Her parents are in town, and we-- - No no no no no, the Christmas angel. - Oh that. Oh well, Mister Vilanch wanted it back. Apparently someone accidentallythrew it in the dumpster, and it means a lot to him or something, because he gave me a hard time, and I took it right over tohis house yesterday morning. - Shit, we need that back. We gotta go over there,right now, come on. - Stop. Are you kids insane? It is 10:38. I can't have two of my employees, going over to my mostesteemed client's house and disturbing him in themiddle of the frickin' night. - All right, all right, no problem. I go see Bruce first thing in the morning, I get the angel back in plentyof time for the wedding. - Okay, but also, bring donuts, and make sure they're fresh. He could tell. And he also likes thedouble nonfat, mocha grande. And you, go to the backfreezer, grab a steak, put it on your face. Get to bed boys. Kids. - Well you'd better hurry up, because you haven't got much time, and we want you on our team. - Bruce, if you're Jewish, why do you have a magic Christmasangel in the first place? - If Bette Midler and Barbra Streisand, two bigger Jews than I, can put out Christmas CD's, I can have a Christmas angel. Besides, the magic menorahis impossible to find. - Thanks. - Really, I've looked. I've looked everywhere. They laughed me out ofVan Cleef and Arpel. - Good, please, tellme you have the angel. - Not exactly, but I know where it is. Just, we've gotta hurry. I'll explain it all on the way. - Okay, Sarah hand me my tux. I gotta go un-gay myself. - You better be back intime for the wedding. - I will, I promise. I know, I know. - It turns out BruceVilanch bought the angel, and a bunch of other crapat some school bazaar, but they sold the angel by mistake, and they made him give it back. I just hope we get there in time. - What do you mean, in time? - Bruce said that the angelwas rumored to be magical, which of course, hedidn't believe until us. He also went on to say, that once the angel isback on top of the tree, and in the hands of its rightful owner, at the school's NewYears Eve holiday show, which they're rehearsingfor right this second, all wishes will become irreversible. - Well, shut up and drive, butch. (tires squealing) Holy Mother of God, thisis my old Catholic school. - This is where the angel is. - I'm not going in there. - Hey, do you want toget married to Sarah, or do you want to toss guys' salads for the rest of your life? - Yeah. (playful orchestral music) Oh my God. It's Sister Betty. Why did it have to be her? She's the reason I was homophobic. - Okay, the angel, can we get it back? - Yeah, you know what, follow me. - Who are you? - Well, the Father thoughtthat we could come by and help you today. - Yes, I'm Sister Ann,and this Sister Tony, Tony with an I. - Father who? - Here, let me help youput that up on the tree. - No, I can manage it myself, thank you. - But Sister it's a longway up, and you look weary. - No, thank you, I've beendoing this myself for 30 years. No go away, just get out of here. - But we insist. - No, no. - Let go lady. I wish I was straight. - I wish I were gay. - Little Tony Parisi. I should have known. Now, why did you say youwished you were straight? There's nothing wrong with being gay. - What are you talking about? You said it was evil. You said I was going to hell. - Well, that was over20 years ago, my son. Get with the times. - All right, all right. Well, it's been reallynice seeing you Sis, but for the love of God,we gotta get out of here. I'm late. (playful rock music) Do you Feel any different? - I think so. I mean, I don't know.
