- Three years ago, Courtney met Chris, who lived in Turkey, online. - Oh, I'm in love with him. - Have you sent gifts? - I've sent maybe around a grand. - Courtney. - She only has one picture where he shows his face. Why is this guy cloaking his identity, not just from her, but from everyone? - Oh, my God, I have a message. - I can hear you. - What is happening? [dramatic musical sting] - All right, so let's text our girl. It's time to get to work. - Hey, guys, welcome back to my channel. We're gonna make some coffee. Watch out, Ayesha Curry.

He could just be hesitant about the long-distance relationship, right? - It's not impossible. - Maybe he just doesn't like FaceTiming. I don't know. - The good news is, her eyes are open enough to know that something's up. [computer chimes] Oh, hi. - Hey. - Hi, guys. - Are you freaked out? - Mm-hmm. - [laughs] Is it Nev? Be honest. - I mean, I've always wanted to meet him, just--I didn't--not like this. - [chuckles] Well, I'm flattered. And it's nice to meet you. Where are you in Ohio? - I'm in Canton. - You're a home health aide. What does that mean? - I take care of people in their homes that are developmentally disabled. - Wow. It's a very selfless job. Good for you. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Anyway, tell us about Chris. How did you guys meet? What is going on? - Okay. Well, I love telling this story because it's very strange. We met on Facebook but through roleplay. - Ooh, fun, okay. - I was on my roleplay account, and the person that my character was with sent Chris's character to try and kill my character, and it didn't happen. I ended up telling him that I had feelings for him. [soft dramatic music] And we ended up in a relationship. - Wow, all right. So when you met Chris, it was as his character. - Yes. - Eventually, he sent me a cosplay picture of himself. That was the only actual picture I've seen with his face in it. And the other picture I have, he's wearing a mask. - Well, wait a second. You have now been friends with his Facebook account, right? - Yeah. - Does he have more photos of himself on there? - No, it's mostly just his art. - In three years, you've only seen two pictures of him? - Mm-hmm. - You don't even really know what he looks like. - I know. - Oh, my God. - Can you show us the one picture you've seen of him? - I sure can. He said it was a werewolf cosplay. - What are you talking about? There's nothing werewolf about that. He's not even in a costume. - [chuckles] - Did you want to see the mask? - Sure, yeah. - That's a mask. - So, Courtney, do you really think Chris is the guy in that one picture? - I don't know. I would like it to be him because it is a very attractive person that he showed me. - Sure. - What do you know about him personally? - He lives in Izmit, Turkey, with his mom. He, to my knowledge, is jobless. He's an artist. He does portraits, anime characters, stuff like that. - How old is Chris? - 22. - Oh, so he's the same age. What do you like about him? - He's got amazing music taste. 90% of the bands I listen to now is because of him. Same with the animes that we watch. I didn't get into anime until he introduced me. Anything that I'm interested in now is because of him-- 90% of my personality basically. - What? - Wow. - He's in a completely different country, has a whole different set of interests, and, like, that's really cool, but what is it about him that attracts you? - It's really hard to explain that. I'd say it's just how he makes me feel. - I get it. The connection that you have is very meaningful. - Yeah. - Do you guys only talk via Facebook? - We eventually went to WhatsApp. - You talk on the phone? - I've only spoken to him on the phone once. - What was the vibe? - It felt like he didn't want to be on the phone. - Mm. - It sounded like he would rather be doing something else. It just didn't last long. - Was it, like, a distinct male voice? - To me, yeah, it sounded male. - And did he have an accent? - Yes. I've tried asking for more calls, and he said no. It's really disappointing. - How can Chris justify not video chatting you over the last three years? - He's just always busy, and he's given me excuses like his laptop's too old and the time difference. - How do you know he's even in Turkey? - I believe he is. He's shown me Turkish movies, shows, music. Did you know that black roses naturally grow there? - Oh, I didn't know that. You've really dove headfirst into the culture. - The horticulture. - [chuckles] Yeah, ever since I found out that he's from Turkey, I love Turkey. A lot of times, I would talk about wanting to go to Turkey to see him. So just the idea of, like, planning that is something that makes me happy, but I don't want to go if he's not real. - Right. - Have you sent him gifts or anything like that? - Back in 2018, I sent him an Odin bust. [upbeat music] - Wait. - It's a mini statue. - And did he ever say he got this--the bust? - Oh, yeah, he sent me a picture of it. - Oh. - So then--okay, so then it confirms that he is, in fact, in Turkey. - Promising. - Wow, okay, interesting. - And he sent me a gift. That very hoodie right there. - Is it a special hoodie? - It's his. - Oh, he sent you his hoodie. - He sent you his hoodie. - Yes, back in 2018. - And it came from Turkey? - Yes. - No money exchanges between the two of you? - I have sent money to his friend. - Why did you send money to his friend? - So that she could give it to him. - How much? - Over the course of three years, I've sent maybe around a grand. - Courtney... - [chuckles] - That's a lot of money. - Yeah. - Courtney, you see how this sounds? - [chuckles] - Who is his friend? Who is this girl? - It's Ece. - And do you ever talk to her? - I don't. - Does her Cash App profile have a photo? Could you pull it up for us? - I used to have it, but then it disappeared. - So she just wiped her page. - Completely. It doesn't exist anymore. I've tried looking for it. - Hmm. - Oh, Courtney. So after all this shadiness, you still have strong feelings? How do you feel about him? - Oh, I'm in love with him. He is actually my longest relationship. - Really? - Yes, we were engaged once. - When was that? - 2018. - What is that? - He sent me that picture. - So he sent you an anime picture of a guy proposing. - Yes. - So that was the engagement? - Yes. And I went, "Yes." And he went, "That was easy." [chuckles] - Wow. - [laughs] - I mean, look, he sounds really cool, okay? He's into cool stuff. He's an artist, and he lives in Turkey. But come on, the guy can video chat, and he's had excuses not to for the last three years. There has to be a reason for that. That, coupled with the fact that he's only ever sent you one photo and you only had one weird phone call, suggests to me that there's a very, very good likelihood he's not the guy in that photo. - I'm ready to get answers. - Mm-hmm. - I have to find out if it's actually him or not. I just want it to be real. - All right, so look, send us anything you've got. Let us do a little research, and we'll see if we can figure something out. - Thank you, guys. - Oh, boy. What do you think? - My biggest concern is that Chris doesn't really care about her that much. - Seems like he's a scammer or at least he's hiding something really big. But it concerns me that Courtney is so invested that she's literally changing her favorite things to be his favorite things. Her personality has now become the things that are his favorite things, and that is a slippery [bleep] slope. [dramatic music] [computer chimes] - Something's going on here. We need to help Courtney. Some classic catfish red flags with Chris. - Mm-hmm. - Won't video chat. Only talked on the phone once. Normally, I would say that he says he lives in Turkey is one of them, but that actually seems to be true. - I think that part is real. - He either directly asked for or hinted towards her sending him money, which she has done, but, of course, he doesn't have his own Cash App or Venmo or wire transfer. She has to send the money to his friend. - Always got to send the money to the friend. - Just shady. - My biggest concern is that, whether it's a guy or a girl behind this, their feelings do not match Courtney's feelings. Like, he sent her a meme of an engagement, and she took that as a real life engagement. - I know. - She needs to be kind of, like, brought down to Earth a little bit because it's just not giving what it's supposed to have been gave. - All right, well, let's do some research. Let's see if we got an email here. All right, here's what I've got for you. His name is Chris [bleep]. He's 22 and lives in Izmit, Turkey, with his family. Here's his phone number, his personal Facebook page. The girl I sent money to is named Ece. All I have on her is just her name. And then the two pictures. - Okay. - So let's go to his Facebook page. All right, so here it's Christoffer [bleep] or Narperist, which seems to be, like, the name he uses-- a sad artist. - One post. Or is his page locked up? - I don't know. Here's his art. [soft dramatic music] Pretty good artist. ♪ ♪ Wait, look. He has another page for his art. The Narperist. Courtney never mentioned he had an art page on Facebook. Oh, and here's his phone number, which is the same as the number she gave us. Here's an Instagram. She didn't mention that, but all this stuff is all kind of available to see on his artist account. He's got a story. Okay. I mean, there's a subtitle there that looks to be Turkish. - Yeah. ♪ ♪ He has a TikTok. I'll look it up. Found it. It says artist, he, him, age 22. - But there's no videos, obviously, right? - There's videos. ♪ ♪ Him drawing. - But is it just his hand? - Yeah. - All these social media profiles, and there still aren't any more pictures of him. It's all just the same art stuff. So that doesn't help. Now let's do a quick image search of that one picture where he shows his face just in case something comes up. ♪ ♪ No. And then here's the mask picture. ♪ ♪ No. What else do we have here? We have his phone number. I don't think we can run international phone numbers. There's nothing else to search. - Well, what about searching for Ece, the friend that Courtney has been sending the money to on Christoffer's friend list? - Okay. ♪ ♪ Negative. Maybe on his Instagram. ♪ ♪ Ece! - [gasps] Aha! - Who is this? Could this be our girl? ♪ ♪ Well, she's into video games and gaming. - Mm. - I just want to see if there's any of her with Christoffer. - Yeah, aren't they supposed to be, like, best friends? - Yeah, there are no pictures of them together. All right, well, let's message her. - What if Chris is Ece? - She definitely seems to have some of the same hobbies. - Yeah. - What if Ece's trying to explore her sexuality? I mean, it might be a tough thing to do in the Turkish culture. - Right. - Think about this: you cannot find a picture of him on the Internet. Why is this guy cloaking his identity, not just from her, but from everyone? - Well, how about the fact that they finally get on the phone once over the course of three years, and she admits that he sounded like he would rather be somewhere else? - Well, to me, that sounds like it was not him. He got somebody to be his voice for 30 minutes. - Or she got somebody. - Right. I think it's her. Ece is in love with Courtney but too afraid to admit it. - Courtney could be in for a big disappointment. - All right, let's get Courtney on the horn for an update on what we found. - If it's this this girl Ece that she paid the $1,000 to, this could turn ugly really fast. [computer chimes] - Hey, what's up, Courtney? Who you got there? - Oh, I have a unicorn. - Is that your therapy animal? - Mm-hmm. - Cute. - All right, well, look, we did some research. We're trying to see what we can find. So let me share my screen with you so you can see what we found. As you already knew, he has his Facebook page, his personal one and his art one. - Oh. - Does that surprise you? - I just didn't know. - Well, on that page, his phone number is the same that you have. He's got a TikTok. Did you know he has a TikTok? - No. - And the big thing we found on his art page is a link to his Instagram. Did you know he has an Instagram? - I did not. - The weird thing is, all of his social media accounts have the same content. They're all basically his work as an artist, but none of them have any photos of him. Whoever he is, he's doing a very good job of keeping his identity a secret. ♪ ♪ The fact that you even have a photo of him is remarkable because there's no photos of him on any of his many social media profiles. But at the same time, he's got his phone number and his email, and you can contact him very easily if you want to commission artwork, so he's not against putting himself out there. He just doesn't want anyone to know what he looks like. - Hmm. - And so then we were trying to find out who this Ece girl is, the person you sent the money to. So we went back to his Instagram. We went to see who he was following. We ended up seeing Ece. Yeah, that's--that's her. So nothing really with Chris, and they're supposed to be close. - Hmm. - We reached out to her. We haven't heard back. - Have you ever talked to her through social media? - No, not that I can remember. - So you've never communicated with her one on one at all? - No, I can't. He said she doesn't speak English. - Interesting. - So what if Chris is Ece? - That could explain not talking on the phone. - Right. - She definitely seems to have some of the same hobbies. She's into video games and gaming. ♪ ♪ - How would you feel about that? ♪ ♪ - I honestly don't know. ♪ ♪ That's not a deal breaker. - Ooh. - Oh. - Okay, that's good. - [chuckles] - Now you have a little crush on her. - I just think she's really pretty. - She is really pretty. I mean, if this is who you're talking to-- - I wouldn't be upset. - And obviously, you guys had a strong connection for years. - Have you dated girls also? - Yes. - Would you say that you identify as bisexual? - Yes. - Does Chris know that? - We have not talked about that, no. - Well, that's interesting. So maybe if it is Ece you've been talking to, she was afraid to come clean because she didn't think you'd be comfortable dating a girl. So I don't know what to do. I think, at this point, we're kind of out of options except to reach out to Christoffer. So what it's gonna, I think, come down to is, you're gonna need to be prepared to give him or her an ultimatum and say, "Hey, if we're gonna keep being in a relationship, "I need to talk to you. I need to know who you are. And if not, are you prepared to stop being in a relationship?" - I don't know. ♪ ♪ I'm sorry. I'm probably about to cry. - You just--you need to do what's best for you. - You're kind of losing yourself to morph into the interests of Chris. I just wish that it felt like he was making as much of an effort for you. - Yeah. - This has been three years of your life. It's okay to be emotional about that. It's okay to be emotional about the fact that you're giving, giving, giving to someone and having to accept whatever they give you in return, even though you know deep down inside, it's not enough. - Yeah. - You deserve to get what you want. So I think we should message him and just say, "Hey, we're helping Courtney. "I know you guys haven't been able to video chat in the past, "but I think now's the perfect time." And see what he says. - Okay. - "Hey, Christoffer. "This is Nev from the MTV show 'Catfish.' "We're helping your girlfriend Courtney, "hoping to help you guys connect via Zoom "and finally meet face-to-face. Looking forward to hearing back from you." How's that? - Sounds good. - Sent. Okay, cool. ♪ ♪ All right, so now let's see what happens. - How do you feel? How are your anxiety levels right now? - They're peaking. - Mm-hmm. - It's the middle of the night there. I don't know if he stays up late or not, but let's assume he's sleeping. Fingers crossed, in the morning, he gets the message, and we wake up to a message from him saying, "I'm available whenever you want." - I mean, I'm really nervous either way. - Courtney, you deserve more, so let's get that for you. - Thanks, guys. - All right, Courtney. Talk to you tomorrow. - All right. Talk to you guys tomorrow. - Bye. - I mean, Courtney is holding it together, but she is very emotional, and this is the longest relationship she's been in. If this doesn't go well and we find out that this person has just sort of been playing with her and using her for money, that is gonna be very, very bad. [dramatic music] [phone chimes] - Oh, my God. Okay. I have a DM from Courtney. "Sorry to bother you right now. "Chris messaged me, and he said "that he wouldn't video chat without talking to you guys first." Okay, that's not a problem. I know it's late Nev's time, but I'm happy to talk to him. Like, whatever it takes to get him to show up tomorrow is fine by me. If we have to do a little coercing... [sighs] Fine. [phone chimes] Ooh, I got something. I got something. I got something. Okay. "I was told to message you?" Question mark. Guess I just keep it friendly. What the [bleep] do I say? "Hey, my name is Kamie. I host the show with Nev." ♪ ♪ "Courtney told me you got our message and wanted to chat," smiley face. He said, "Yeah. I don't know about the show and don't want to know." Hmm. How would you feel about jumping on Zoom with us tomorrow and keeping your camera off? Once you're comfortable, you could turn it on. ♪ ♪ He said, "Ha. No. Stop pushing it." What? Not pushing, just making convo. ♪ ♪ "You're pushing. I don't like you very much." What the hell? This guy is just full of [bleep] and making excuses. But Courtney would be there. She's really cool, by the way. And she's very into you. ♪ ♪ "I'm not doing the show. Don't contact me again. Good night." [bleep]. I think I just [bleep] this up. ♪ ♪ - All right, let's see. What do we got? Oh, whoa. Wait a second. Yesterday night, "Hey, Nev, I just tried calling you. "If you could get a hold of me whenever you're able to, I'd really appreciate it. It's important." And then Kamie. Oh, boy. Some drama seems to have transpired overnight. [dramatic music] [computer chimes] What did I miss? - The tea is piping hot this morning. - What? - So last night, I had a DM from Courtney... - Mm-hmm. - Basically saying Chris says that he doesn't want to talk to us because he doesn't know us, and he doesn't want to talk to any strangers. - Sure. - And Chris was asking if he could talk to you or I because he just wants to be comfortable. But I just told her like, "Yeah, for sure. Have him message me." So he does. - Oh! Okay, wait. Let's get Courtney in the Zoom so you can fill us both in. So you and Chris have now been texting. - Mm-hmm. [computer chimes] Oh. - Hi. - Hey. - Hey. - What's up, guys? - There is a lot going on right now. - I'm just getting filled in on last night's events. - So Chris and I, we had a conversation, and I said, "Hi, my name is Kamie. I host the show with Nev. "How would you feel about jumping on Zoom with us tomorrow and keeping your camera off to start?" And he said, "Ha. No. Stop pushing it. I don't like you very much." And then he said, "I'm not doing the show. Don't contact me again. Good night." - Whoa. - I didn't know what to do at this point. But then, I'm in the bed, about to fall asleep, and lo and behold, I get a DM. He says, "I was told to message you to talk "a bit to get comfortable. I don't want to talk about the show." So I'm like, "Okay, cool. Let's talk about something else." And let me just say, it's an interesting ride. Let me scroll all the way to the top. - Oh, my God. Are you kidding me? - I said, "Let's talk about something else. I hear you're into anime. I know a few good ones." I lied. I don't know a few good ones. He said, "Yeah, anime, games, books, nerd stuff." Games, I know. We start talking about different games. We start talking about consoles. Like, clearly, we get into a full-ass convo. And that was when we started having a little vibe. When it seemed like we had gotten somewhere and I was like, "It was good talking to you." And he was like, "Oh, okay. Well, I'll talk to you later." And then this morning, he messages me, "Eh, hi." So now I don't know how to segue into this because whether I'm talking to Ece or Chris or someone else, when it comes to getting them on a Zoom, clearly, any mention of it is like, "No." - Whenever I go about talking about important things with him, I kind of, like, ease it onto him. - Courtney, no offense, but, like, the gentle tactics you've been using might have been effective in slowly making him more comfortable, but certainly hasn't been enough to get him to actually show his face yet. So at some point, we have to say, "Hey, so today is the day. "If you're not gonna do it, then fine, but if you are, it has to be, like, now." - Okay, let me try this. Real talk-- let's talk about Courtney, because that's no game. That's real life. - Nice. [phone chimes] - "Okay." That's good. That's a positive reaction to talking about the reality of his life. - I said, "I obviously know how she feels about you. How do you feel about her?" - Oh, okay. [dramatic music] - He said, "I like her a lot and all." - Aw. - "I'm just not really sure if I love, though." - He's not very open on the whole emotional stuff. - "But don't get me wrong, "it isn't just her, it's in general. "I don't think I'm capable of the feeling. But I do like her a lot, I guess." - I don't know what to say to that. - Could this just be Ece not being comfortable with her sexuality? That's what it sounds like to me. [phone chimes] "I'm not gonna be on camera." "Courtney is open-minded, "even if you're not the guy in the picture. Courtney's camera is on, and she looks really pretty." - You're so sweet. - Listen, we got to lure him in. Said, "Sure she does." - Aw. - Okay, send me the link. Send me the link, Nev. We're in a sweet spot. - All right, sent. - Copy, paste. Sent to Chris. Ha! ♪ ♪ - They said, "Okay." - They said, "Okay." - Let's see if they follow through. - Are you okay? - My anxiety is kind of up. ♪ ♪ [computer chimes] - [synthesized voice] Hi. - Hello? Can you hear us? If you can hear us, maybe you could-- - Oh. There he is. - Yes, I can hear you. I can hear everything. - What is happening? [uneasy music] [bright chime] - Oh. - [synthesized voice] Hi. - Hello? Can you hear us? If you can hear us, maybe you could-- - Oh. There he is. - Hi. Yes, I can hear you. I can hear everything. Sorry for being off camera. I'm not talking. I am not comfortable. - Okay. Well, hello. I'm Kamie, Nev, and Courtney. - Hi. - Hi, Courtney. - Please just talk without, like, robot sound. - I don't like my voice. - You have to say something, eventually. - This is the voice I'm comfortable with. - Ece, if that's you, it's okay. We're all open-minded here. And Courtney is okay with that. - I am not an imposter. I am not Ece. I am Chris. - Now that you're talking, your voice is great. - So, Chris, so you are in Turkey right now, right? - Yeah. - And are you also 22? Right, that's how old I think you said you were. - Yeah. - Courtney, why don't you explain to Chris why this is even happening? - Well, long story short, this is what Kamie and Nev do. They help people meet each other. They make it easier. - You've been asked for a call for three years, though. - Well, listen, even talking to us is a big step for you. It was just as much of a big step for Courtney after, you know, three years of you guys talking. It's been a long time. And all she's wanted is, like, literally this moment right now. - Yeah. The thing is, I don't like my voice and the way I look 'cause, even though I'm a guy, I have a condition, basically a hormonal imbalance, which is why I sound, like, softer than a normal guy would. And I have more, like, softer features. So that's one of the reasons why I didn't even want to call, 'cause even my friends sometimes, like, pick on me for this thing. - Yeah. But you know that Courtney is not one of those people. - Courtney is understanding and loving. - It's been, like, so long that even if I were comfortable enough to share myself with her, it would be just kind of awkward for me. - Also, what do you think? Do you just see her as like a cool friend that you talk about stuff that you guys both like together with? - Obviously, she's more than a friend. - Hmm. - Chris, I think, despite your insecurities, you already know that you're a likable person, even if you may not like yourself. But you and I both know what you have to do right now. It's time to come on screen to let Courtney see you. - I know this was gonna come. - Please. - Okay. [suspenseful music] Hold on. No, no. It's good. - You already know that you're a likable person, even if you may not like yourself. But it's time to come on screen to let Courtney see you. - Please. [suspenseful music] No, no. It's good. [quiet dramatic music] - Yay! - There you are. So the picture you sent her, that was you? - Well, Courtney, looking at Chris, I'm going to bet that you like what you see. - Yeah. I'm so happy. I see nothing but perfection right here. So--you're so perfect. - I mean, how does that feel, Chris? Like, this is the girl who you've been talking to for a long-ass time, and you guys are really cool. And she doesn't care about any of the things that you're the most insecure about. Like, she doesn't give a [bleep] about hormones. - I know. - It's okay to be nervous. - Chris, the question that I have now is, you know, normally someone in your situation, who is very private with their identity, we would assume that you weren't the person in that picture. Since that was a picture of you, why then didn't you at least feel comfortable sending other photos? That way, at least you could control the pictures that she sees of you that you like, that you feel good about. - Have you always felt like that? - Have you had a relationship, a girlfriend, in person in Turkey? So would it be fair to say that physical intimacy is not something you're super experienced with? - Yeah. - I asked because I know Courtney is probably ready to get on a plane tomorrow. Are you nervous about that? - Kind of. - You know, you say that, but I'm looking at Courtney, and it's--it's not adding up. - I only have two hands. I'm pointing at myself with all ten fingers. - I'm just saying I think that, for once, you could maybe give yourself permission to not think that someone doesn't like you, because she does. And you keep trying to tell her she doesn't. And she keeps trying to tell you that she does, so... - Hey, Chris, who is Ece? - Because Courtney mentioned that she would send money and that it would get sent to Ece. - Yeah. - Why didn't you just have Courtney send money to you? - But you did give Courtney some address. - So what was the money for? - Well, I think that they just don't understand you. But I know someone who does understand you. I do want for us to be able to give you guys an opportunity to talk without us. - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay, cool. - Hi. - [sighs] - I'm.... [pensive music] - All is forgiven now. So I wanted to know something, though. - Yeah. - You brought up the hormone imbalance. Why were you afraid to tell me? - You can trust me with anything. - I know. - So does this mean that we'll be able to talk more, like on phone, video chat? - All right, yay. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Well... - I'd like that. Would you be able to take me to go pick some black roses? - Yeah. - Yep. I knew about it 'cause I looked it up. - That sounds really nice. I'm just so excited. [computer chimes] Hi, Kamie. - Oh, hi. [computer chimes] - Clearly, you guys were into some kind of conversation. [Chris chuckles] - All right, so how was it for you guys just now? Did it feel good to chat and hang out? - It felt really great, actually. - Wow. Very cool. - That's amazing. You know, this is a good start. And I'm very proud of both of you for coming on here and doing what needed to be done. - Thanks. - It is refreshing to see that you guys can now talk to each other. Chris, I think, despite your insecurities, you have a lot going for you. And Courtney sees that. We see that. So hopefully, this experience can be the beginning of just starting to feel a little bit better about yourself and a little bit more confident. And I am excited for the two of you to continue talking, and, hopefully, a trip to Turkey will be on the horizon and you will finally meet in real life someday soon. - Yeah. - That's the goal. - All right. Great meeting you. And talk to you soon, Chris. - Bye. Thank you. - Good luck. - What do you think, Courtney? - I'm so happy. I had to suppress all of this. Like, but finally! - Always know that you deserve everything that you want. It will come from somebody. It could be him. It could not be him. And that's okay. - Either way, don't take anything less than what you deserve. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Thank you. Yeah, good luck, Courtney. - ♪ Can you blame my human nature ♪ ♪ My human nature ♪ ♪ My human nature ♪ - You're talking to someone who was on "Catfish" as the catfish. - Yes. - What?! - Wow.
