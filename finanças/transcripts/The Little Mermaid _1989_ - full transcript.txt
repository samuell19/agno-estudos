Hi, this is Ron Clements, I'm the co-writer, co-director of Little Mermaid. Hi, I'm John Musker, I'm the other guy, the other co-director, co-writer of The Little Mermaid. Hi, I'm Alan Menken, the composer of Little Mermaid. You're gonna hear a lot on this audio commentary about Howard Ashman, who I consider to be the greatest theatrical dramatic talent of our generation, as a writer. Howard passed away before Beauty and the Beast was released and after Little Mermaid came out. Coming up is an earlier interview that Howard and I did at the time of the release of the film, and it's great to hear his voice adding to ours. This is Ron again. We had a really tough time getting this to work right with the ship coming through the fog. This is John. This was generated by a computer but then painted in traditional ink and paint style. You really saw a change in perspective there, in a way that we couldn't have done with traditional animation. We tried to keep colour very low-key, it's kind of an overcast day, because we wanted to save the colour for when we went underwater... We shot this with traditional fog filters on the animation camera just to give it the feeling of a foggy day. This is Alan, and I remember how many times Howard and I took stabs at the top of the movie musically. We had a much longer song, originally, which told the whole story of Eric and the boat. The back story of the witch and Triton, there was a whole story created. And a lot of dancing and sweeping. It's a big, elaborate production number. And it actually got storyboarded. Roger Allers, the great story artist, storyboarded it, it exists. Ultimately, it seemed like it took a little too long and was too involved, so we went with a shorter, trimmer version. One thing we did want to do, though, was to start the movie on the water surface and save going below, 'cause we felt it was like going to Oz or something like that. So, it's almost like this is our black-and-white section going into colour now. Classic moment for me is when the fish jumps and hits the water and we go into this theme, and that's where the heart of the movie Just jumps out at you. I remember we demoed this SO many times. I can remember you and Howard Ashman were sitting there at the piano, and Howard would be like, "Alan, give me that musical figure, "something watery, something watery." That's right. And then Alan would come up with this thing. I'd never even heard the term "musical figure" before, and I'm like, "Well, that's what that is.” I'd create this little... It came off the top of my head, and it became this unmistakable stamp, now, of Little Mermaid. - Musical signature. - Anytime one hears it... And also, with any musical, and Howard would say this too, you have to establish right at the top what are the rules for this musical. If somebody is coming out and they're on a stage, and they're singing All That Jazz, you go, "Okay, I get what this is."” If somebody comes out and they're animated, and they're doing a sea shanty about the fable of The Little Mermaid, you go, "Okay, I get..." So long as you get what world you're in, you can accept it. Ron again. This first shot of King Triton's palace is a multiplane shot. After CAPS was developed, a shot like this would be easy, but at the time, if you wanted to move in on something and give some sense of dimension, you needed to use multiplane. I think this film was the first use of multiplane since... I think there might be a shot in Jungle Book, which was kind of reused in The Rescuers, [ think. Those trumpet fish were the first real explosion - of higher key colours. - Really bright colour. If you look, still-frame, as he passes in front of the camera, on the lower left corner of the screen, you can see Mickey, Donald and Goofy there in the audience, waltching. Will Ryan did the voice of the little seahorse. Speeded up a little bit. You hear the fanfare as Triton sweeps in, and then when Sebastian comes in, there's a little dinky fanfare, and that is actually me playing the kazoo. Listen to the last note particularly. We did have fun. Sam Wright and Ken Mars doing the voices of Sebastian the crab and King Triton. Sam Wright was wonderful to work with. He's been playing Mufasa in The Lion King on Broadway, but prior to that, he'd been the father in a musical called Tap Dance Kid. He was in the Fruit of the Loom commercials as a dancing raisin or something. A great, great comic actor and singer. He was one of the New York actors, both he and Jodi Benson were cast without John or I having ever met them in person, we just heard their voices on tape, 'cause they auditioned in New York, but we loved what they were doing. Ellen Woodbury did some of this animation here. - And Will Finn I think did some. - And Will Finn as well, yeah. In the lyrics coming up in this song, when you talk about the sisters, among the sisters, Atina is a musical I had written, actually, that Michael Bennett produced, called Atina: Evil Queen of the Galaxy, which was a big flopperoney. Arista, Attina Adella, Alana And Howard, in the lyrics, makes reference to Alana, and that was Howard's way of including me in the lyrics. One other bit, Andrina was actually my aerobics teacher at the time, - 1 was taking an aerobics class. - Is that right? We used to have more dialogue in this scene, we had a backstage scene that got cut out. It's like, "Where's Ariel? She's not here! What am I gonna do?" And then he's forced out onto the stage. We just liked the staging of the shells opening. It just seemed kind of fun and it's a little campy, I guess. But we liked it and Howard went along with it eventually, but we had to sell him on the idea. Howard always had very specific ideas of how he visualized the staging. This set-up shot of the sunken ship has cross-dissolving beams. Mike Peraza, our art director, did the layout for this. It really helps set a great mood for the rest of this sequence. We knew this movie would have more effects animation than any movie that had been done in along time. And virtually every scene underwater has effects in it, it has either bubbles, or light refractions or distortion. It added a huge amount of complexity, but it's just a really great motivator in getting the whole crew together, knowing that they were facing, in some sense... I think we presented it as almost an impossible challenge. People like impossible challenges, because it gets them excited, and I think the whole effects department was very excited about the challenge of this film. Alan had never written an underscore for any movie before, and he wanted to do it and we were interested in doing it, but he'd never done it before, So we said, "Let's use this as kind of a dry run, so to speak, “or a trial run, and let Alan get his fins wet on this one.” So, this was the first thing he wrote. I was terrified. It was an action cue, it wasn't just a romantic cue, it was something where you really had to hook into the... There's a big shark chase coming up and all that stuff, so Alan had to hit all these accents and beats and all that, So it was something different for Alan. And I also remember, when we scored the movie, this was the first cue that we recorded. I remember sitting next to the orchestrator, I listened to it, and I said, "Oh, my God, this is awful. "Oh, my God, this is just terrible.” And I see Howard and John and Ron conferring at the front, their heads are down and they're talking to each other. And I'm thinking, "Oh, my God, “they're trying to figure out how to fire me.” Then finally Howard gets up slowly and walks over to me behind the board. I said, "Yeah, I know it's terrible. We can work on..." He says, "No, in this one measure, “could you move this one beat forward?" I said, "Yes." He says, "That's great.” I made a choice to do this very much in the style of the earlier animated features, in which, instead of sound effects, you're basically using music for a fall, or music for an impact or for anything, almost like ballet. So, it's a very busy score. I learned how to get less busy after Little Mermaid. I might also mention that the shark here is animated by Matt O'Callaghan, who storyboarded this sequence as well, and that doesn't always happen. So, he really shaped it, both in terms of the storyboarding, and then he wound up animating the shark, as well as Louis, the chef, later on. The shark, his name is Glut, although his name is never brought up in the movie, he was originally going to return later in the movie, and Flounder was going to actually defeat him and Flounder would have his moment of glory, finally. But as we simplified the story, Glut never does return. When this sequence was first developed, there was Flounder, but Ariel also had another companion, a dolphin, which we called Breaker, but he left very quickly. We thought that there were too many characters with her along for the ride. So we gave some of Breaker's personality, which was a very energetic, gung-ho type, we moved that into Ariel, and that actually made her a more lively sort of character, to give her some of the dolphin's personality. If they would have given us more money, some of these scenes where Scuttle was walking on this rock, would've had more contact shadows, where you'd see his shadow cast on the rock, but that was a concession to the budget and the time restraints that we were under, that we didn't put those things in the film. Il miss them. Buddy Hackett. Buddy Hackett. There was a different voice for Scuttle, originally. Our boss, Jeffrey Katzenberyg, didn't like the other voice we had. He's like, "Guys, guys, get a comedian. That's what we did on Oliver. "Richard Mulligan, we got him and the character came alive. "Find a comedian.” We went through a list of comedians... Buddy improvised some here, which we encouraged, ll think that was fun. He also, when we first recorded Buddy, he had written a song for Scuttle. Have you heard the song that he wrote? No, but he actually sang it on The Tonight Show. Yeah, he did sing it on The Tonight Show. You'll never know what lonely is till you live by yourself on a rock Once we cast Buddy, we wrote it to sound like Buddy, and Buddy was saying, “Don't write for me, write for the part.” His very first takes, he was playing Scuttle with an artificial seagull voice that we kind of thought, “This is not the way to go.” We wanted him to just be himself and be natural, which he did, and he was great, but there was a little bit of tension just at the very beginning of his first session. Jason Marin, who did the voice for Flounder, his voice changed by the end of the movie, and we were trying to get Little Jason. He came in, "Yes, I'm here to do the finishing lines on Flounder.” We're like, "Jason, can you just..." ” He had to cheat it up a little bit. We like to give characters entrances, and so to give Ursula theatrics, we really wanted her to come out of shadow, even the sort of descent into the camera is all just meant to give her theatrics. She's a very theatrical character. The first time we screened this with an audience, and we see that she's an octopus for the first time, there was an audible reaction from the audience, just a little shudder. And that made it feel like, "Yeah, that's working for her intro." Seriously, 'cause originally, the witch wasn't conceived to be an octopus, she was a different fish, but not octopi, but it really went with the musical approach, in terms of the silky, tentacly, trying to wrap Ariel in and reel her in snakKily. The snake charmer thing in here, I think, worked well with Alan's music. On the witch, we actually took some live-action footage from a documentary, Disney Mysteries of the Deep, and Roy Disney was very versed and familiar with that, and worked on that and brought that to our attention. Rob Minkoff, the initial animator of Ursula, did a walk cycle literally on top of that. So her lower half was this octopus. We really were able to get real-life observed behaviour, combined with the character of this big, overweight, but exaggeratedly graceful vamp, villainess. And that really became the basis for all her movements later. Well, it was ruined! That's all! Completely destroyed! This concert was to be the pinnacle... Ed Gombert was one of the great storyboard artists that worked on the film, and he really came up with the recounting of the tale that Flounder does and the way it was played, and that's really pure Ed Gombert in there. Probably, you can see it, if you look at a still frame, Flounder actually transforms into Scuttle for a couple of frames there as he's talking about Scuttle, he physically transforms to Scuttle. But then this seagull came, and it was, "This is this, and that is that..." Most of these bubbles are hand-inked, which is a throwback to the old-school, most of this movie is done with the Xerox process, which is something that was done from 101 Dalmatians forward. Little Mermaid was actually the last film to use cels and Xerox. Right, the older films, Snow White and Pinocchio, were hand-inked. There was actually a person who traced the hand drawings of the animation onto cels. The Xerox process actually photographed them onto cels. However, to get the look of those older movies, we really wanted the bubbles to be inked, so, in fact, they were, but as a way of trying to do it on budget, those were actually inked in China. So, the problem for us was, when the Tiananmen Square incident was happening in China in 1989, it looked like there could be a civil war in China, and we weren't sure we were gonna get our cels back with the bubbles on them. Our bubbles were trapped in China. The bubbles were trapped in China. Tim Engel, who was really overseeing all that, said, “There's a possibility that we may not be seeing any more bubbles." And the movie was under the wire. We were praying for democracy in China. But also praying we got our bubbles back. That was very funny. Once again, we got our bubbles. They came. I don't know about democracy in China, but... The crab was animated by Duncan Marjoribanks. I'm always amused whenever I see it, 'cause I think of 6'56" Duncan Marjoribanks animating this teeny little thing. It's one of the great things about animation, that the animators don't have to look like the characters they portray. Also, Andreas Deja animated Triton, who, I think, he's always said he based on his father somewhat. Without the fins, yeah. A lot of these underwater scenes involve those little patterns of light there, those are live-action patterns, the way you see light playing under a swimming pool almost, and those were double exposed over the painted backgrounds we drew to give a watery effect. That's a technique we generally used, as well as filters over the film, to make this all seem like it was happening underwater. Mark Dindal, the head of effects, who later became the director of The Emperor's New Groove and Chicken Little, he came up with this effect. It's actually fairly simple and not that expensive to do, but it added a lot to the underwater scenes. Particularly, in the song, Part of Your World, it gives an extra magic to that, and was used more extensively there. As you can see, all the refractions of light where the light is hitting the underwater sections. This pan of the grotto, I think we made this too short. It moves too fast, I think. If we had to do this all over again, It would've let you see things Just a little bit more. But it's a nice shot. If only I could make him understand. I just don't see things the way he does. We should mention, in terms of this song, that one of the very early screenings we had for an audience, we brought in a class of school kids into the studio, this sequence was pretty much all black-and-white, it didn't have the effects and everything there, and in the very first screening, the kids squirmed a lot. That brought up the very controversial thing that there was some talk of either cutting this song or cutting it down, which, pretty much, Howard was horrified at the idea, we were horrified, Alan was horrified, Glen Keane, who was the lead animator on all this and responsible for a lot of it, was horrified. And even though there was a lot of discussion, it finally came to a point where we could leave it in the way it was for an additional screening now. And in this second screening, there was more colour. For whatever reason, however, it worked out, they didn't squirm. They were quiet through the whole number. Thank God. You know they almost cut Over the Rainbow from The Wizard of Oz. And that was one of our arguments with this song. Howard's contention was every musical needs a point at which its central character, the protagonist, sits down on a garbage palil, on a rock in the sea, and says, "This is what I dream of." And, of course, the rest of the story is all based on creating obstacles that this character has to overcome to achieve their dream. It sets Ariel's character, it sets her up, what she wants, what she needs, and so much of the rooting interest of the mermaid comes out of this song. And certainly, I think, we're all very glad this wasn't tampered with, 'cause it's such a signature of the movie. Also, the earlier lyrics to this song, I might mention, Howard generally resisted changes that we would suggest, and rightfully so, 'cause many of my own personal ideas were stupid, but one that he did actually slightly agree on, his earlier lyrics of this song, he talked about leather in China and things like that. And we said to Howard, "Well, her information is from this guy "who doesn't have his story straight, the seagull.” So Howard went back and readjusted the lyrics, So he put in the thingamabobs and the whatchamacallits. Those weren't in the first version of the song. 'Cause he agreed that, yeah, that actually was in character for her, to have these offbeat terms for things. That painting right there, Glen Keane picked out that painting 'cause he wanted a picture, an image of a fire underwater to go with the lyric. This shot where Ariel reaches out was the last shot done in the movie. We wanted to do that on the multiplane camera, and there were just too many problems and we ended up doing it optically. At the time, it was technically very difficult, and I think it was shot four or five times and didn't turn out right. The opticals didn't match right, it had seams... Her arm would not go outside the hole properly. And it got to a point that we were running out of time, literally, and we were on a budget and other restrictions, we had one last chance to get that shot to work or we had to use a compromise shot that was a shot that we developed as a last-minute resort, where she didn't reach out beyond the thing. And the very last time, it worked. Sebastian's presence as the witness of the song is partly there to mitigate the squirm factor. He's judgmental about it, and you have that extra dramatic tension. If it's just being done as a solo in one moment, it becomes a little eggy for an audience, a little bit cloying. Now, for the students of film, they can see some mistakes here. Watch this thimble on his foot, sometimes he's got it... Now, no thimble, it's gone magically. But now it's back. Who let that mistake through? This is your sequence. It's my sequence, yes. Ron directed some sequences and I directed some sequences. And this was Ron's sequence. It's a nice sequence. It's a beautiful sequence, I wish I had done It. We didn't have time to redo everything on this. We were aware of a lot of the mistakes. But there were severe budget and time restrictions, in terms of making this film, S0 we had to pick our spots carefully, in terms of what we could fix and what we had to leave. Dorse Lanpher, great effects animator, did the fireworks in that shot. It really helped. Thom Enriquez was the storyboard artist that storyboarded this sequence. Beautiful draftsmanship. Our story team on the film overall was really an amazing story team, many of which have gone on to be directors, art directors, production designers... In this scene, we see several of the staff, including the guy dancing, Rasoul Azadani, who was a layout artist on that, and who we've worked with pretty much in all the movies that we've done. This dog, Max, we added, didn't really exist in the fairytale, but we wanted to give the Prince a companion to bounce off of. He was coloured grey, he was a big Sheepdog. We did have a nightmare with the paint of this character, because a lot of times, that grey would just crawl on film. You can still see it, here and there, it's a tough colour to make work. Mark Henn animated these scenes of Ariel as she came up over the side, and I think he really did a great job of capturing her innocence and just her wide-eyedness at this whole new world that she's looking at, the Prince in particular. This is really the heart of the story here, obviously, her falling in love with the Prince. This is one of the pieces of music that I wrote first as a source piece for you to animate to. Right. I know you talked about Grieg. Although, I don't really know Grieg. Yeah, it's sort of a little bit of Hall of the Mountain King. And Grieg was Danish, so it all made sense somehow. One of the more difficult characters in this film was Prince Eric, and there's a tradition of Disney princes, that they hadn't worked very well. In Cinderella, I talked to Eric Larson, who animated on If, he said, "Yeah, he was Sftiff, I didn't really get it right.” Animating the prince has been called the most thankless job in animation, because it's probably harder to do than any other character... Even in the Andersen fairytale, you don't get much of a sense of the Prince, as much as you do of the Little Mermaid, and that's a challenge. The more realistic human characters are always the most difficult, but, still a character like Ariel is still more fun. Particularly, Ariel was a great heroine. She at least had the extra aspect that she was part fish, and she could swim underwater and she can move in ways that humans couldn't possibly move, and that's why his screen time tends to be more limited too, because it's just difficult. We had Matt O'Callaghan who animated the Prince, Mike Cedeno. Christopher Barnes did the voice on the Prince, and I think he did a really nice job of trying to get an engaging, likeable guy. The storm sequence coming up was actually one of the first sequences done on the movie, along with the Under the Sea sequence and the Louis sequence, those were actually the first things that we actually started animation on. Because it was almost like a musical sequence, in that it was so rich in production value, if we didn't do it early, we knew that we might not get it done, 'cause it would take longer and there'd be impulses to simplify it and cut it, and we'd be under the gun, So we knew it would be difficult, So the sooner we could get to it, the better. We called them "money shots." Which, I guess, means that we're gonna spend extra money on them. It was also because it was an action sequence, there were just so many aspects of it that could be done earlier on, whereas sequences that were primarily character-driven, we almost wanted to save until the animators had a little more time with the characters. This sequence certainly is a tour de force of effects animation, the fact that it was done first really gave us a chance to go all out. And Mark Dindal, who was the head of effects on the movie, did a great job on this sequence. The grey-green cast of the skies in all this was inspired by an N.C. Wyeth painting he had done, I think it's from Kidnapped, or one of these, where there's a shipwrecked figure in the foreground and a ship in the background. And that was the inspiration for the visual look of this sequence. I never had a successful solution for this scene, I directed this sequence, and I wanted to be able o see the statue before it sank, SO we cheated, So the statue was floating for a minute. It's a marble statue, it made no sense whatsoever, but I couldn't figure it out. "How do we show that before it goes away?" So, it was bizarre, but there it is. The water animation is beautifully done. And water is very difficult to animate convincingly, and Ted Kierscey did a lot of it, and a lot of the animators. It's funny, when you score a sequence like this, every hit becomes a source of stress for you. Leading up to the session, you want to make sure each hit is gonna work, so they're all imprinted indelibly on my brain. I like that jazzy horn figure for the action when he's running across the ship. I think that was cool. I remember this was very early scoring for me. I should point out that the orchestrations were done by Thomas Pasatlieri. He was a great help to me in learning the art of scoring. Animation was not, at that point, hip. I remember a film composer, It was difficult, I was asking his advice, and he said, "Look, man, “nobody takes a score from an animated film seriously.” He said, "Just take a powder." - He just meant like... - Phone it in. You think about how that must've turned on its ear within five years. And now we're into the reprise of Part of Your World. Here's a rare interview that Howard and I did at the time of the release of the film. Alan writes great ballads, I think that's one of Alan's real gifts, is Alan can bring a tear to your eye pretty quick. And ballads are really, really hard in a musical for the whole family, because kids aren't famous for liking love songs. So it's hard to write a song that moves, and has a little bit of rhythm, and also tugs at your heartstrings and is a soft number. And the challenge of this number was to do a ballad that also moved the plot forward, which is why the subject matter of being part of your world was so important. What is she really longing for? What is going to not just stop the action but keep everything moving? This is John here. Howard's lyrics on this, again, the original version was slightly different, in that Howard played the lyric of this as, kind of, that she was disappointed, and the original lyric on this was, “I'll never be part of that world."” And she was sad as she dove into the water. I remember we talked with Howard about it and said, just because of the shape of the story, she's gonna be kind of moony about the Prince and feeling up about it. We said we thought, actually, it would be better to play this as an up thing. And Howard, again, that was the only other thing we ever talked Howard into, and he agreed and he revised the lyrics So that it was much more of a positive statement than a statement of regret or sadness. Howard did mention to us early on there was an element of this that was like a handicapped girl wanting to walk. And I think that's what he drew on for the lyrics of the song, partly. Actually, the song itself should be titled Part of that World. And this is Part of Your World. - They've both taken on one title. - Yeah, that's true. Glen Keane animated much of Ariel in this part, a great animator, and he did this scene where she's on the rock, and I remember we shot this with Sherri Stoner, but Glen acted out this scene for her. And Glen is a burly, football-player-looking kind of a guy, and there he was, he's doing this action of just tentatively coming up over the rock, and I still emember Glen's physical performance, it had all the sensitivity that you see here in his drawn version, but picture a muscular Gene Kelly kind of a guy doing this. Here it is, a moment of determination. Every teenage girl's desire to be free of her parents. It's a major story moment. Everything up to that point is really set-up. Now the situation is really clear that we've got a mermaid who is in conflict with her father, who wants something that is forbidden in her world and will do whatever it takes to get it. Her daddy will love that. King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl... I might mention Kathy Zielinski animated the witch in this sequence. And there aren't a ton of women animators, but she's one of the best animators, period. But she did a great job with the witch there. Those fish in that opening shot were computer fish, which we thought we might use more of in the movie, but at this point, the computer animation was not quite at a point where we were totally happy with it. So we used the computer fish to a minimum, but they were in that one shot. And I do believe that this scene of Ariel was the first scene of Ariel animated in the entire movie. Mark Henn animated this scene. In the story reels, we had a longer version, and there were fish doing their hair and there were various things with the sisters that we took out. Howard and I were both huge fans of the earlier animated features. He felt that as the musical updated itself, the animated musical would also update itself. For us, Little Mermaid was the follow-up to Little Shop of Horrors. As different as they are, it really was. And there are people who joke and call Part of Your World, "Somewhere That's Wet." I haven't heard that. - The other thing I want to say about... - That's funny. That's a joke on Somewhere That's Green. And so, we did a pastiche of '50s and '60s rock and roll, Little Mermaid, we did really our own pastiche of Disney. When we started working on Sebastian, first you guys had Sebastian as a stuffy English... Clarence the crab. Reggae was very hip and Howard said, “Let's make him a Jamaican crab “or a Caribbean crab. Calypso." I think of Harry Belafonte, that kind of warmth. And so here are some thoughts from an earlier interview with myself and Howard Ashman. It's very hard to write contemporary sounding music in a fairytale context. You're dealing with long ago and far away. And you really still want to have a feeling that modern kids and adults can enjoy and start to move fto, because that's how you get energy. And it was sort of a trick. When I talked to John and Ron before the script was actually written, we had a long conference about that. Was there a way we could give the crab something in his personality that would make it possible to have a special kind of music that had some kind of rhythmic edge or contemporary feeling to it? And what we came up with was that there would be a Jamaican flavour to what he did in the music. And that was to get energy, to get a little bit of a pop feeling, and yet to have it be true to its fairytale roots. This song you guys finished in Burbank. We started out actually at my farm in Pennsylvania, and Howard said he always wanted a figure that just circled back on itself. That didn't end, so the song really started with the figure. And one of the things I always talk about is in the world of animation, they're so specific in their references, and you guys especially, SO as we made all these references, they animated the references. And then when we went back to scoring, you guys wanted every one of these things that you had animated caught with different orchestral colours. So you'll notice where there's all these different sea creatures, every single one is caught with a very specific scoring reference. And I remember when we were working on this, Alan was right next to us, and Robby Merkin, who was doing the arrangements was right down the hall. So they would go back and forth with the storyboard artists and with us and be seeing hits that we were suggesting or a different fish they could use. And they'd come back, "Which one was this again, that was doing this part?” It was the overdub session of all time. That's all I can say. Overdub means after you've recorded the basic track, then you add other parts. We did have to fight a bit with Jeffrey on this, in that we wanted to use colours as the song got progressively more joyous and that the colour changed to these oranges and these reds. And Jeffrey had a hard time. He's like, "Underwater is blue, guys.” And so we had to convince him it's okay. So in some scenes, we had to sneak a little blue in the corners to keep Jeffrey happy, but eventually, he went along with it. We felt the mood of the song, no one's gonna worry that it's not blue anymore. It's hot. Howard recorded the demo vocal on this one and he was just... A lot of the jokiness of Sam's reading. Sam did a great job, but Howard, his original demo was full of spice. Howard's vocals were definitely the blueprint for the final result. I think Sam's rendition of this song was one of the big things, in terms of getting cast for the role, because we heard a lot of actors sing that song and a lot of them were very good, and certainly Howard set the tone for it. But I think Sam just did an incredible job with this song. The interesting thing about Sam. Howard auditioned him in New York. And we cast him never having met Sam, but we heard a tape of Sam. And he was so great just on the tape that we said, "That's the guy to do it.” And then we really met Sam the first time when he came in to record it. We had never really met him before at all. The song that changed the Academy Awards. Alan won Oscars continuously... I think there were eight, but who's counting? Every Academy Award that Alan was involved in, he would win multiple Oscars. - Usually score and song. - Don't they come in pairs? Then at a certain point, the Academy changed the awards so that musical scores would be a separate category. We always looked at that, that that was the Alan Menken adjustment or whatever. But Alan was winning so many awards, and everyone else felt left out, So they had to change the awards So that other people would have a chance. Remember, I showed up for the Academy Awards, and they had me seated on the aisle, which I guess said something, because prior to that, I had been sitting in the middle of the aisle where I could never escape. And I said to my friend, Dean Pitchforq, who wrote Fame and Footloose, I said, "I don't know, what do you think's going to happen?” He says, "I don't know who's gonna win the Oscar, “but I looked backstage "and the Academy Award had scales on it." This sequence was very early in production, Ron directed this sequence. This was the first stuff done on the crab, it seemed like... Yeah, it was the first animation done on the crab. Duncan Marjoribanks did the crab in this and Andreas Deja did Triton. And Ed Gombert storyboarded this and it's pretty much... The water is just fantastic to look at there. But this was a little sample of the movie in a way that went first and as I say, Ed Gombert storyboarded it, and it pretty much is exactly the way he storyboarded it. And it is just a nice little bit between the two of them that we were very happy with the way it turned out. And it gave a nice sense of setting those two characters. But it's not a complicated scene from a directorial standpoint, except from the acting standpoint that it's really getting a certain kind of dynamic in contrast. It certainly is fun with the huge, imposing character, like the sea king and the little teeny character like the crab just kind of carrying on everyday conversation like they're not conscious at all of their size difference. We always thought Ariel's grotto was like a teenage qirl's bedroom, and she's got her poster of a rock star who was the Prince. And that was the person that she was infatuated with. And we were trying to draw the analogy with modern teenagers and their trouble with their fathers, obviously. Overprotective parents and kids that don't want to have to be tied down by their parents. If you notice, the statue gets madder and madder as the sequence progresses. - Is that right? - His expression just keeps getting... Was that an accident or was that deliberate? Not just the King, but the statue gets madder, too. I never noticed that. But, Dad, I... Is it true you rescued a human from drowning? The father-daughter relationship in this movie I find to be one of the most emotional. Possibly because I've had two teenage daughters and seen them grow up. Yeah, my daughter was born as we were making this, and now she's more this age, So I've seen it from both ends. We got a lot of letters in terms of this movie. And there's fan letters from people who liked the movie. But I'd say we got more serious letters from fathers and daughters and things that they were emotionally involved in. In some cases, aft least with one father in particular, that this kind of brought about a reconciliation with his daughter who he was estranged by. And that was nice to get letters like that. The only thing I find difficult is the idea that she's Triton's favourite daughter. The idea of having a favourite daughter seems... It's contrary to someone who's got more than one daughter. Our theory was that she's the most like him, and that that in effect was what created the conflict. To the extent that we said when Triton was a younger man, he had red hair. That they clashed because they're both strong willed and individualistic. The children's book illustrator, Chris Van Allsburg, did some drawings for us when we were trying to develop the look of the film, and he did one of Triton's palace with greens and golds, and he also did a study of the moonlit grotto that was one of the earliest visual representations of Ariel's grotto. Paddi Edwards did the voice of Flotsam and Jetsam, and this voice was treated a bit, but really, Paddi did have a very distinctive, raspy, great, unique voice that we thought was perfect for these two. And they're animated by Shawn Keller, who's a quirky, nice guy, but got a lot of sinister mileage out of these guys. What's very effective about them is the idea that they trade off their lines in a totally seamless way. But there is something. Howard was extremely specific about what he wanted. It was always a big concession for Howard to have me play any role, 'cause he frankly would like to have played every role. It carried over with the actors when Jodi was performing the number, Howard had so many specific things in his head and Jodi contributed a lot, but Howard had phrasing ideas and things that really were wrapped into his approach to it. And Pat Carroll, really, he helped steer her through it. Certain songs more than others. But the phrasing just was very, very specific. I know a few people who could have written Ursula, but nobody at the level of the way Howard wrote her. Howard had said that one of the things he always wanted to do was run a children's theatre. So you combine that with that West Broadway or West Village sensibility and you get a sense of who the man was. Tremendously emotional person and also so hip and so cutting edge, as far as the zeitgeist of our culture. And certainly here, it's in Ursula, but I remember Howard said our assignment was to write a score for an animated musical that could sit on the shelf alongside Cinderella and Dumbo and Peter Pan and Pinocchio and, of course, Snow White. That's what he always said. Right. No! No! She's a demon. She's a monster. Why don't you go tell my father? You're good at that. That was Ron's line, "Why don't you tell my father? You're good at that.” And I've always liked that line just because it's so teenage girlish. - Well it was John's line. - Believable. “Teenagers, they think they know everything. "You give them an inch and they swim all over you." This exterior, the witch's place, Mike Peraza, who is our art director, did that really cool layout of that sea creature and her actual shell, he designed that as well, and I always thought it was kind of Georgia O'Keeffe-esque. Those out-of-focus, dangling tendrils in the foreground, that was actually shot on a multiplane camera. The one done off the lot at Disney, 'cause the only one we could find that was up and working was actually done by a cameraman that Mark Dindal knew who shot stuff for Filmation. So that's one of two or three multiplane shots in the movie. A few of these first scenes of the witch were animated by Rob Minkoff, but then he left to do other things, and Ruben Aquino really did 98% of the witch and most of this song coming up, and this animation here is Ruben's animation. And he did a beautiful job, in terms of just getting her personality, as well as just the technical issue of keeping all these tentacles alive and moving, and I loved what he did. Of course, Rob had also done an early exploratory drawing that Howard had really liked and we had really liked of the witch, where Howard said, "This is great, she looks like a Miami Beach matron." And we got into a whole thing about Divine. Divine is a cross-dressing guy, George was... What was his real name? - His real name was Glen, but... - Glen, okay, yeah. Everyone knows Divine as Divine. People also know Divine, of course, as the original Edna Turnblad from the hit movie, Hairspray. He was from Baltimore, where Howard was from, I think. And so, some of the early development art that Rob was doing and others were doing was really trying to get some of Divine's big, campy, overweight diva, get that into the witch. And so there are still vestiges of it in the witch, although at one point, the witch even had a mohawk a la Pink Flamingos - and all that. - Also Divine. Also, Divine played that character, and Jeffrey thought that was a little too extreme. I don't think Jeffrey was aware that we were relating it to Divine, he just looked at us and he's like, "Guys, it's 10% too much.” I think he was right on that, as I remember, it was pretty extreme. Just want to point out the voice of Pat Carroll. We knew Pat Carroll from the Danny Thomas show. And we really had a hard time casting the witch, because Howard had done So great with the demos. It was hard to find anybody that could match Howard. And then Pat Carroll came in and she really did a great job. Nailed it. I know. She always talked about how it was a cross between Tallulah Bankhead and Maurice Evans, Shakespearean thing in this vampy, throaty Southern belle or something. And that's what she got in the performance. But on the whole I've been a saint To those poor unfortunate souls Now, here's the deal. I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days. Actually, this song was done in two separate sessions. We did it, and then we went back and did it again - just to get all the nuances. - Right. I think Jeffrey was pushing for that. She did a fantastic job. Gary Trousdale storyboarded this sequence. And he really tried to visualize all this deal making. And I thought he did a great job of really making it visual, so that we'd understand, even without the soundtrack, what's at stake here. Some thoughts from Howard Ashman again. We wanted to make songs that would tell the story, songs that would really move the story forward, really push the plot along and keep things driving ahead. So, it's not like you stop and sing a song. To my mind, this recalls what it feels like to write a successful musical for the stage. We were there at the genesis, and we saw it through every step of the way with our collaborators. Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? We perform when we write. You have fto. Howard is the actor. Pat Carroll is wonderful, but you haven't heard the witch's number until you've heard Howard perform it. And you never should. It's wonderful. I generally get to play things like Ariel. Just 'cause you're shorter. Everybody would rather write for Captain Hook than for Peter Pan. They're just more fun. I don't know why. And Ursula's an especially fun villain, not only 'cause she looks like an octopus, you have that great movement with her lower regions. But she's also very sophisticated as a character. She's much more verbal. Then as a lyricist, that was fun for me, because I got to make more rhymes and more puns and more sophisticated humour with her. I see her song as a comedy number, first of all, and a character number. And then, third, talk about things that are driving the plot forward. At the beginning of that song, Ariel doesn't even know who Ursula is practically. And by the end of that song, she's a human. So, a whole lot changes in that little three-minute sequence. I think we are thinking of something almost Kurt Weill-ish from The Threepenny Opera, for the basic feel of that number. And it's very seductive and Ursula's very seductive. And she's seducing Ariel into making this deal. I remember when we did this, Howard talked about the shape of this number, and I'd never really heard that term used, as far as music went. But he was talking about how, in terms of this last thing with the spell, that it almost was like a three-act play in itself or something. Well, it's a big musical scene. You have the basic body of the song. You break for the dialogue when she's outlining the terms of the contract. Then she comes back in full on the end of the song, - and then we transfer into the spell. - The spell section. One thing we haven't talked about, which is so great about you and Howard and the songs that you did, is the storytelling aspect. There are a lot of bad musicals, where sometimes you cut the songs out and sometimes it seems better. And the songs are so much a part of just telling this story. They're integral to the story and they advance things. We have to be good thieves. We always have to take from your script, and sometimes take the best aspects and incorporate it into our songs, and cover as much of the plot as we possibly can. This shot, I might mention, we always thought of it as our Sports lllustrated shot. But it was this backilit thing and a girl in the water, like a shampoo commercial or something. There was something picturesque we wanted to do about it. In the Andersen story, when the mermaid walks, she left bloody footprints and all. We didn't really want to do that, but we did want to make this transition where she got her legs feel a little bit painful, in an homage almost to the Andersen thing. That exterior of the palace, Rowland Wilson designed... He is a great draftsman. He designed the Prince's palace. He did a drawing that we loved that combined these Mediterranean elements. It made it a palace unlike any other Disney fairytale palace. And with the whitewashed stucco, it was really going for a warm Southern Mediterranean feel that he thought would be attractive to a mermaid who had been stuck all her life in the cold ocean. We had a challenge here to stage this, because technically, in between those legs and that upper body, she's really not wearing any clothes. So, we had to get her dressed and yet keep it discreet. So, it was staged in a way where she was underwater in this sequence. That helped us. There's such a feeling to this movie in scenes like this that is just infused with this fantastic innocence. And it always makes you feel just wonderful. I got it. It's your hairdo, right? You've been usin' the dinglehopper, right? No? No, huh? Well, let me see. New seashells? This scene right here, where the crab goes through this slight nervous breakdown, and then comes through and decides he's actually going to help Ariel, actually Howard wrote that. - That was added. - Wrote the dialogue for that. We had the basis of the scene, but we were struggling. And actually, Michael Eisner had felt that the crab needed a real turning point here. And we were really knee-deep in stuff and a little bit burned out. Howard wrote this scene, and it's a beautiful scene. - Is that right? - Yeah, he did. In terms of where the crab comes around and says, "You're going to be miserable for the rest of your life.” This is Howard's dialogue here. Because Michael Eisner felt like his change from being against Ariel to being her ally in this happened offstage in our earlier version that we showed him, and he said, "Unless you show that onstage, people aren't going to understand.” I think it was a good point. He was right. And Howard did a great job of comically putting this over. When he goes from, "I'm not going to help you. This is the worst thing ever.” To, "Okay, I'll help you." And he did a great job. Howard, of course, as a book writer on our musicals, he was an executive producer on this and on Beauty and the Beast. Actually, he moved out here and was living out here. But what a resource to have that kind of person offstage, so to speak. It says, "Additional dialogue by Howard Ashman," if you watch the end credits. There were two or three scenes where he did rewrite some of the dialogue. And this was the key one, really. We weren't sure when he came in, in terms of how that might work, and he didn't write for a while aside from the songs. He held back. Not that we would have had a problem with it. For whatever reason, he held back for a while. And he was involved with our writing and would make suggestions and would make things. But he didn't write himself until this point. And then Howard stepped in and wrote this, wrote two or three other bits that are all really memorable, great little moments in the movie. I never knew that. I'd love to know where they are. We'll tell you as we're going through. We were really going for a watercolour look with these backgrounds, where you see the highlights really almost showing through the paper, that was really a throwback to a Pinocchio painting style and that kind of a thing, in terms of the way this I00Ks. Glen Keane animated Ariel in this section. We did use live-action reference for both Ariel and Eric to help the animators to get a jumping off point. Sherri Stoner was an actress, a great improv comedian, and just brought a lot of spark to it and helped to inspire Glen Keane. The combination really worked into some very nice acting. You seem very familiar to me. Have we met? We have met. I knew it. You're the one, the one I've been looking for. Glen animated this scene here, where she's trying to do her pantomime thing 'cause she can't speak. And how can she put over what she did? And it's just a tour de force. Animation is great when you have to rely on pantomime to really put over the ideas. Certainly, early on in this movie, there was a lot of controversy over the idea that our leading character would not speak for a big portion of the movie. And certainly in story reels, it was a problem, because she seemed to disappear a lot in the scenes where she didn't speak. But we were kind of saying when she's animated, when the acting is there, it will be different. And Glen Keane and Mark Henn, who did a lot of this material where she doesn't speak. I think that was the case. Once the animation got in, she was alive and she kept alive. And it's a tribute to the art of animation, but that's animation acting at its best. Pantomime can be a tough sell, as we found out with the carpet in Aladdin, similar idea that... You have to say "Trust us” a lot. "Trust us. It will work."” One of the things that I guess also helps keep her alive without her voice is that music plays a role. - Yeah, absolutely. - It was key. The underscore becomes basically her voice. It does become her voice. Yeah. This sequence in the earlier version of the film, as we were working on it had been longer, and it was felt that this needed to be paced up a little bit. So, this whole section was trimmed down a little bit. These washerwomen had a longer rant that they talked about. All this got compressed and turned into one little set piece of mistreatment of the crab. There's also a bit with Max the dog chasing the crab around the castle, that got cut. We had trouble with that shot. Making it read, I think. We did it four or five times. Yeah. Just wasn't clear that those were stuffed crabs or something. Just something about it wasn't so clear. Here, again, for all you continuity fans, you can watch the knives and forks Jump around on the sides of the plate. And one scene they're there, one scene they're not. You got a napkin, you got no napkin. I don't know how we let all that through, but we did. This is one of my favourite scenes where she walks into the light. Mark Henn animated it. Just the staging of it and the layout, Dave Dunnet is our head of layout, I don't know if that was Dave's layout, but it's one of my favourite scenes. We always called this the Cinderella scene. She's coming out in her magic dress and everything. Let me help you, my dear. There we go. That's better. See, now, she had a napkin in that last scene and no napkin now. No plate, either. Grimsby is Ben Wright, who is a great character actor. And we cast him. We loved what he did in the reading, we cast him based on that, not realizing that he was actually the voice of Roger in 101 Dalmatians, and that he also did a voice in Jungle Book. But we didn't know that when we cast him. Yeah. Carlotta's voice is Edie McClurg, who's a great comic actress who's done a lot of work in film and television, and was on Pee-wee's Playhouse and various things, but a wonderful comedian. I know we tested a fair amount of actors for Louis. And there again, whenever Howard's done the demo, you feel like you got to find somebody that is at least where Howard is at and hopefully can bring something more to it. And that's not easy. I knew René Auberjonoils more as a dramatic actor, and I didn't know him so much doing comedy, but when he came in and read for the part and did this song, he really brought a lot of comedy to it. Of course, in different countries, they dub Louis differently. So, in France, I think he becomes an Italian chef. - Is that right? - Yeah. That's right. It's always somebody else. You look at Chef Louis and you go, "Would we get away with a song in an animated now “in which basically one of our characters “is literally describing how you're going to kill?" - Right. - They're tight. And all the imagery, knives and axes and all that. We loved it. And we did it as was constructed. But now, I think they would give us a hard time. Well, because people overthink things. Les Poissons is a very slight song. It's very French musical. It's very deliberately in that style. And it's mostly a comedy song. And this song as a song is a fairly compact, short song, which really completes itself with the chase sequence at the end. Originally, this was a longer thing, too. Howard had a whole, "Class, do this and class, do this.” It was just a little too long, So we had to tighten it up a bit. Gary Trousdale storyboarded it. Don Martin, Mad Magazine sort of drawing. Like many other sequences, I remember it was a lot of trial and error for the chase, for the music we used and the length of it. And it also had the demo love aspect in that I really did not want to use the cancan, Offenbach... I really wanted to use... And for whatever reason... Did we give you a hard time about that? I don't remember. ! just finally said, you know what, somehow the cancan, it really worked better for all of us. And I just went, "Okay." And I think I may have played with it, and in the end we said, "You know what, "we're trying to reinvent the wheel. Let's just go with the wheel."” And the association of the original cancan, which everyone knew, was so strong. It was a question in a Disney film how far you can go. And I think Howard found which was right. Had he gone a little further than this, it might've been too far, but I think it really works well. - Cruelty can be very funny. - Yes. And his sense of humour, of course, was... He loved to beat up his characters and just make merciless fun of them. Howard was so smart and had such a tough sensibility. - He was caustic. - Caustic, I think, is the word. Alan did something on this movie that we haven't done in any other movie. And he actually wrote, in effect, the silent film score, where he on a solo piano recorded a bunch of themes that we then put against the action. Again, many of which Alan recorded without having seen the action. There were ideas of skelches of tones and things like that. And we fitted to that in cases. Occasionally, it seems to me, he did it live. That is, you're just watching the picture and doing music, reacting to the picture and... There were times where we got so used to Alan's solo piano underscore that even when we heard the whole orchestra, there were a few spots where I missed the solo piano, and I actually said to the orchestra a little bit, I wasn't sure, "What if we just left those in as solo piano?” I was thinking specifically of the scene where Ariel is brushing her hair, and she's out on the balcony at night and there was a beautiful theme. It still is, the music that's there, but it was just the solo piano that had a wistfulness or something, S0 we got used to those things. - Well it's called demo love. - Yeah, right. Yes, we've had a lot of that, unfortunately. It's very tough when you get very used to things that are temporary, but they're there for maybe three years before they get replaced. And this was another scene that Howard rewrote our dialogue on. - Is that right? - Yeah. "Just pucker up your lips." ” These are Howard's dialogue. We talked about her bedroom, the design of it. Howard mentioned, “I think it should be very Laura Ashley.” And so, that was one of the things we were going for when we designed her bedroom. And the lighting on this was really nice. There again, we had to pick our spots, but this has a nice - warm feeling to it. - "You are hopeless, child.” And Duncan Marjoribanks did the pucker up scene. That's a beautiful scene of Sebastian. John directed that sequence, but the little bedroom scene is one of my favourite scenes in the movie. You are hopeless, child. You know that? Disney had gotten away from those kinds of lyrical scores that go along with the visuals and accent the visuals. You really brought that back, I think, which was good and we wanted that. I think people think just because something is retro, going back to the '30s and '40s, that the reference will mean nothing because our audience are Kids. And they don't realize how much in the subconscious of our culture can be accessed by artists. It's not just whatever is contemporary. There's a lot that's timeless in this. We wanted to keep the King alive and the story of the lonely King, where's his daughter at, 'cause the father-daughter story was so strong. Occasionally in these films, I get to write stand alone pieces of music. The Tour of the Kingdom IS one of them. Yeah, I love what Alan did on this. Again, we had a piano track version of this that we were animating to, originally. That was a very simple thing. You don't often get to, as a composer, write a continuous piece of music that lasts more than about 15 seconds. And I loved that Penny Lane horn in there. - That was neat. - That was very cool, I thought. Brenda Chapman storyboarded this sequence, and we struggled with this goofy puppet show, trying to make it read and yet be quick and funny. - Probably a little too quick. - Yeah, too quick, probably. Here are some thoughts from an eatrlier interview with myself and Howard Ashman. When I had been offered the opportunity to write the underscore for the entire picture, I was looking for, "How do you do this?" And there's nobody around who does this anymore, really, this kind of underscore. In a sense, you're choreographing like you would a ballet. You're choreographing the movie. Therefore, you're pulling from traditions that haven't been pulled from in years, in terms of underscore. In the old days, a lot of the music was written first before they animated a thing. Just even the background music was written first. And in some ways, we've gone back to some parts of that old tradition in deciding the songs as the story itself is getting developed. So there are lots of places where they have animated right to the music. If there's a little... They've animated to that. That... was in the little demo recording that we made. And it's been there for three years. And finally it becomes a little dance step. It's amazing to see. Now we come up to Kiss the Girl. If there was gonna be a single, it was gonna be Kiss the Girl. But that never really developed. When we wrote our original treatment, we had a little sequence, and Howard said, “I think there could be a serenade.” And so that evolved into this, Kiss the Girl. And the stakes in that song, they really help give a dramatic tension to this. And it has a plot point. We could never get Howard to just say, “I'm going to write a song for the pop market,” until Beauty and the Beast. We basically took the rock riff... Which is the standard riff you'd think of, in terms of Phil Spector or Billy Joel, and just turned it on its ear in a little bit of a Caribbean way with a... And just built up through all the animals into the various sounds, into a full arrangement. Those reeds that are coming up are reused from The Old Mill. The old 1937 Silly Symphony. We try not to steal things from other movies too often. Unless they're great. We all steal what we have to. I actually did a little corrected animation on that one scene of Ariel, jJust sort of looking over. Somebody adjusted the timing, So one of the few scenes I quasi had something to do with animating in the movie. It's strange, but I did. Howard Ashman again. Kiss the Girl has a little bit of a Caribbean or maybe even a little Latin feeling to it, and I'm a doo-wop person, So it's got just a little bit of... Thrown in there for spice and for fun. Sing with me now. It's a good time to talk about the voice of Jodi Benson, which we hear as the voice of Ariel and then it becomes the entire emotional impetus for Eric. Jodi is somebody who had worked with Howard in Smile. And I had known Jodi for years in New York. Very talented actress, singer, dancer, the whole deal. We had auditions here in L_A., we had auditions in New York that Howard supervised. And we heard her audition, not having been there, present at the audition, but she did such a great job. In most of the auditions, people would come in and sing Over the Rainbow or something like that. And then on call backs, I think they did Part of Your World. But I think Jodi was very comfortable with doing those slips between speaking some lines, singing some lines. There's a very real quality in Jodi's voice and she has the classic Menken voice, which I really like, someone who can give you a good Broadway belt but then mix into a soprano. One of the things we did totally differently than any other picture was we went directly from our demos and we had all of the vocal performances done to synthesizers. And then we wiped away the synth tracks and recorded orchestral parts - to replace them. - Which was the wrong way to do it. Occasionally, we got into some trouble on that. 'Cause the mistake that we made was, we animated to those tracks. Unfortunately then, those tracks all had to be replaced at the end, and they had to hit all these musical accents. So it made a nightmare for the musicians at the end of the line, trying to hit these on-stage musical hits that we had animated to. It was a slight nightmare when we were recording. But they were great synth tracks. And it gave the studio the comfort to move forward with the project without having to spend a fortune up front. Disney animation is always done in the warm-cool thing here, where you play off warm things against cool. So the little fireflies against the blue background. ! just like that play of colour. And it's our homage to Pirates of the Caribbean or something. - Really? - Yeah. We had originally written a longer scene between the Prince and Ariel, hadn't we, at the end of that, that we wound up doing away with... There was a whole scene that was gone. Where the Prince talked about his conflict, of he likes her, but there's this other girl that he's heard her voice, and rubbing it in a little bit, it was a Hans Christian Andersen-y scene. But we certainly had to cut things down a lot, in terms of the story, it got simpler as it went along and essentially, that didn't seem like it was necessary, that you got the Prince's conflict without him having to articulate it. So we took that whole scene out before we ever animated it. This idea coming up wasn't in the Andersen fairytale. The Prince was getting married to another girl, but it wasn't the witch. The witch was more prominent in our thing, in the idea of the witch actually using her voice and transforming into something to thwart Ariel from winning the Prince's heart. That was an idea that we added to the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale. Also one of the things that surprised me in our early screenings was that scene when the Prince looks in the window and you see Ariel combing her hair with a fork. It got a strong reaction, and it's something that you'd almost take for granted as you're working on the movie, and the fact that people really responded seemed to indicate like they were getting something here, they were really into that. Howard again. It's just amazing the way the animators enrich and bring to life and cause something inanimate to act. It's like having the greatest actors in the world performing your material. And it's just what we had in mind. And it is what we conceived, in terms of tone and in terms of content. There's just something about the Disney fairytale cartoons, going all the way back to Snow White and then to Pinocchio. I grew up on Pinocchio and Peter Pan. And the idea of doing one of those, it's like there's all these library books on the shelf. There's Snow White and there's Sleeping Beauty and there's Cinderella, there's Peter Pan, there's Pinocchio, and to try to make something that fits comfortably on the shelf with those, what a difficult thing to do, but what a great thing to try to do. It's a humbling experience, I'll tell you. But to try to do something that could actually be comfortable in that line of titles is pretty amazing. I think it does give you latitude to work in all kinds of musical styles and just to dream. And this is one of early CGl, computer-animated steps, was still the infancy of computer animation, but we used it. It generated a 2D drawing that then was painted, but the actual stairs were built in the computer and then painted by hand based on the drawings generated from that. Congratulations, my dear. Patty Disney, the wife of Roy Disney, I remember her talking after the preview. Where this scene coming up is one of Patty Disney's favourite scenes. Where she's hearing the news, and she does this little thing with her hands, and she's just kind of disturbed, and she always singled this out - as one of her favourite scenes. - That's Mark Henn. And Renee Holt, I think, did the cleanup on this. The cleanup on the movie Vera Lanpher supervised, and the cleanup staff did a great job. Yeah, and the cleanup animation is... The animators actually work rough and there are other artists that clean up their work. They take the scribblier drawings and make them tighter and more precise for painting later. In this case, we used black Xerox for the characters, but we wanted a delicacy to it So people actually used a mechanical pencil to give a very fine line, which almost gave an ink ook, in the sense that the lines were thin enough, they would pick up some of the colour around it. And it gave a delicacy to it. It was hard to do. But they did a great job on the cleanup. Roy Disney"s involvement in the film, certainly Roy had a nautical background, he was a yachtsman, he loved the sea, so there were various points in terms of terminology, he changed some of our dialogue to reflect the truer nauticalisms. I think he changed something we had to "a following sea.” I still don't know what a following sea ls, but we used that line based on Roy's suggestion. I think Jodi enjoyed also playing this sort of villainous character when Ursula has gained Jodi's voice, so to speak. She was sick of being sweet. Gave her a little angle to play with. The sea witch! Oh, no! She's gonna... l gotta... We first started to record the actors in 1987, and some of the recording continued till 1989. So it was about a two-year period from beginning to end, in terms of recording sessions. We actually recorded the entire movie. Everybody was out for a week where we recorded all the dialogue in the script, all the songs in terms of that week, and we started since we had all the actors, we did a reading of the entire script with the songs, everybody singing the songs and the actors doing their dialogue. And it was pretty exciting, except that when it was over, it turned out that nobody had pressed record. We hadn't recorded the entire reading. And we actually then went back and did it again. We did the second take of the entire film. I guess I blocked all of this out. You were there, Alan, but it's okay not to remember it. It was a horrifying thing for us, we felt responsible and we were. I think we were probably the ones who should have told someone to press record, but... It's like nobody said action, So they didn't roll the film and they blew up the fort. But at the same time, after it's going for an hour, it seemed like maybe someone might have wondered whether or not it was supposed to be recorded, but it didn't happen. 'Cause we had had table readings before that that affected the writing of the script and the casting of the characters a little bit. But at that point, I think we got a sense of the actors playing off of each other more so than anything. We were happy 'cause we usually hear the actors in isolation and don't hear them as much together in the same room. And we got a good sense of Ken Mars really feeling like he could be her father, and the difference in voice quality between the crab and Ken and all that. I think it came to life in the room, but I don't think that we really rewrote much based on that reading. No, I don't think we did a lot of rewriting. I know we were a little concerned at the time, because we may have been a little over-rehearsed at this point, which is the difference between Broadway and movies. In animation, normally, we don't rehearse a lot. The actor comes in kind of familiar, but there's a freshness to that. As they're just doing the dialogue spontaneously, that we realized that the actors had learned this like a stage play. But there's a certain slight sense of losing spontaneity that way, So that they almost had to work in the recording to try to get the spontaneity back. Usually, the way we did the recording of the actors, Ron would be out in the recording studio with the actor helping prompt them and give them specific on-site direction. I would be in the recording booth trying to hear it more the way an animator would hear it. I didn't almost look at the actor, and I would just listen to the tracks and try and just listen to the vocal performance. And Ron was doing that with Buddy, and Buddy didn't like having somebody breathing down his neck. So, he did mention to Ron, “I'd like to do this again. Alone." And I slumped out. We did a little sound trick on her voice there when it's this disembodied voice, we made it sound a little bit more ethereal, and then as it comes back into her throat, then we dissolved off that effect to give it more of Jodi's natural voice. In our first script, our first treatment even, it's very easy to write that she has the most beautiful singing voice anyone has ever heard. And now comes the point... Now, you've gotta find somebody who can live up to that. But I think Jodi was the girl. One thing I do remember is throughout the whole process, dreading the post-production in which we were going to have to thread that voice through, and orchestrate around it and somehow make it work. It's very complicated. I know that the earlier scene where Ariel loses her voice and it goes into the shell works beautifully. And it seemed like it might be problematic, but you really have the sense that she's singing, and yet suddenly, the voice is now in the shell and it's not in her anymore. And through the mixing and through the performance, everything, - that just really sold the idea. - Disney has great sound people. Great mixers. Mel Metcalfe was the music mixer on this. Terry Porter was the head mixer and Mel did the music mix. Terry Porter did all the dialogue mixing and made all the different recordings - to match perfectly with the rich vocals. - Fantastic guys. ...binding and completely unbreakable, even for you. I remember we had big meetings, long meetings, all about hair, Just about hair and how to handle hair. Underwater, things need to move. So, it made it a more complicated movie, in that we wanted the hair generally not to be at rest, just to keep alive the feeling that you are underwater. It added a lot of complexity, because the hair had to move at all times in the underwater sequences. Whereas in normal animation, characters go into holes, they rest. That gives the animator a rest, too. But in this case, there was a lot of extra work that the audience isn't really conscious of. But it adds a lot to the underwater scenes. We had a great story crew on this film, all the storyboard artists, Ed Gombert, who also did the Under the Sea sequence, and Roger Allers, who was a director on The Lion King, Gary Trousdale, who was a director on Beauty and the Beast. We just had a fantastic storyboard crew. Chuck Campbell, who did the sound effects on Roger Rabbit, his team, Lou Edemann and Rick Franklin particularly did a lot of the specific cutting for the film. They were the team that really helped create the sound for the movie, trying to get a unique underwater sound and a fuller effects track than had ever been done on an animated film to that point that we had been involved with, certainly. And they had to really try a lot of things to get variety in the underwater ambience. And there was a lot of work done with that. One thing I felt was good on Mermaid that we didn't have to deal with was we didn't have to really deal with comparisons, in the sense that nothing like this had been done before at all, really. And certainly nothing had been done like this for years. So, it was like, "This is a real musical! “This is fresh. These songs are so great and they tell the story." But then, say, like when Beauty and the Beast is done, you're now comparing music you're hearing for the first time with Mermaid, which is music that's become a part of you. So, I've always noticed on the reviews that when the next film comes out, there were early reviews of Beauty and the Beast that would say, "Well, this score is good, but it's not Mermaid." And then Aladdin would come out and it would say, "This score is good, "but it's not Beauty and the Beast." How can you compare something that you're just hearing for the first time? We had a different version of this earlier where the witch didn't grow huge, and Ariel stepped in the way of her bolt at the Prince and there was a whole different scenario here. And our boss, Jeffrey Katzenberg, felt like it wasn't a big enough climax. And at the time, the movie Die Hard had come out. And he's like, "Guys, I want more Die Hard." “How do we get Die Hard into The Little Mermaid?" So, we wound up with this giant witch, which wasn't in the earlier draft, and tried to make her more of a formidable obstacle, 'cause she didn't seem formidable enough in the earlier version. Also, I think it was always intended that she would be Killed, which is tricky. But by transforming her into this monstrous giant, maybe that made it more acceptable to do her in. Although she still is done in in a fairly violent way. These were all long sequences, and it was... You're just pulling the music out of you. "Okay, another 20 bars." Are we done yet? Another 20 bars of Sturm und Drang. Every time I see the end of this movie, the general feeling that I get inside is exhaustion, I remember. It was my first score. And I had come through about two-thirds of the way just fine. I get to the last third and it's... Or last quarter... And it's nonstop wall-to-wall action-adventure hits. And this was actually in slightly pre-computer days. So, it helps that you have, nowadays, in terms of synching cues and all that you didn't quite have then. Well it was a transitional time. It was getting into MIDI stuff and all of that. Right, we were just getting into it. I was, I think, one of the first people to work exclusively in MIDI. And it was an amazing help, because in the beginning of doing the score, I would write the score with the click track, and set up my measures and write the music. And then I said, “I want to see how it sounds." So then, I play it into my computer in MIDI and play it back. And at some point in the way, I said, “Duh! Why don't I just write it right onto the computer "and avoid this second step?” The mermaid on the rock was in the identical pose with the mermaid in Copenhagen. That was our homage to the iconic statue there in Copenhagen of Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid. And in terms of Howard's writing contributions, this one may be the biggest of all. This scene was originally played more pantomime. The same idea, but without words. And then Howard, as we were going through it, I think, feeling that, "There should be some spoken words here to put this over.” And Howard wrote this little scene with the King and the crab. And the great thing he did is that he put it in subtext. Obviously, the King is saying, “I'm going to change her into a human.” But without ever saying that, he just says, “There's one problem left. How much I'm going to miss her.” And that says everything. And that was Howard Ashman's line. I remember talking to Howard, when we were down in Florida when the film was done, and there was, I think, a parade or something where they played music from Mermaid in this parade. I remember Howard crying because he thought, “This movie is going to last beyond me.” And I think that was his first feeling that this actually might move into the culture, move into something, that was going to go beyond his own life. And so much of Mermaid ls Howard, I think, obviously. - He got teary about that, huh? - Yeah. But I think it was because he knew his days were numbered. - And that's for Howard. - He was so vulnerable. A man who was so tough. He could just tear you out of the room. You come in, you go, "Isn't this great?” And Howard would go, "Well." We did want to wrap up all the characters here. - Wedding bells and Louis. - So we brought Louis back. Again, Jeffrey felt like the crab needed to give Louis his comeuppance. And so, we storyboarded this rather late in the process and animated it. We had an earlier idea where Louis and the crab become friends. And shout, "Friends, schmiends!” I still wince slightly at this "yes” moment coming up on the crab, but... Teeth coming out. And to give Jeffrey his props, he wanted to add the line, “I love you, Daddy." Originally, we didn't have that in that scene. We just had an over-the-shoulder shot. And he was like, "Well, you can put that over the shot "just to cement the... And so, here, the first Disney chorus probably for quite a few years. At first, Howard wasn't so sure about using a Disney chorus. And he was like, “Is that too old-fashioned?" But eventually, I think he thought, “No. That actually aligns the movie "with these great Disney classics." We had to reflect back to the classic Disney score. Snow White and Pinocchio and all those things, and this was a chance to do it. This particular shot right here is actually the first CAPS shot, which is Computer Animated Production System. Yeah, rather than using cels in that shot, all the characters were painted in the computer, and that ship was all composited in the computer. Then that process later went on to be used completely from The Rescuers Down Under to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King. But that was its first test run. It didn't work particularly. We had a lot of problems with it just in that one scene. Every aspect of this production, you could say we definitely tested the waters - with The Little Mermaid. - Right. We were trying things that hadn't been done in a long time. And we didn't know how to do it necessarily. It was a stretch for all of us, I think. That was fun for us to challenge ourselves. But this established a new mould mandatory for every animated film after. It established the idea of an "I Want" song, which was not a formula idea within this, but... And it made the Disney choir okay again. And definitely break into song was okay again. And our attempt in all this was we wanted to make a film that reflected our sensibilities. And it wasn't a film that you just found like it came from 1940, and you open the vault and there it was. And I think it's a testament to the people, Howard and Alan and all of the artists, everyone involved in it, that they tried to put something of their own lives and their point of view into it. So, they brought themselves into the movie. And that spirit, I think, is what helped make it the success that it became. It was also the film that kind of re-established the idea that animated films could be watched and enjoyed by adults and young people even without children. It's hugely hip among theatre audiences. It became a date movie. I don't know that anyone expected that, It wasn't made with that in mind. But it was a film for audiences of all ages, and it lived up to that. I think that it works on different levels, So that a little kid watching it can waftch it in a certain way. And an older person can waftch it from a completely different perspective, but definitely get something out of it that's meaningful. That's what Sebastian's there for. A whole generation of kids are now interested in going into musical theatre, going into film, going into animation because of The Little Mermaid. And swimming. Swimming became popular. Sometimes I feel guilty. I hope that they can all make a living. Yeah. I think the music is central to the movie's longevity. And just the freshness of it, and the emotion that Alan and Howard got into this music. And the relatability of the father-daughter story, as well as the characters and the fantasy, and the entertainment values of it. I think musicals had sort of become out of fashion to some degree in film, and that this reminded people that there's something really wonderful when it's all mixed together - in a way that works. - Yeah. We were sort of regarded as heroes for making this movie, in a way, in that the movie musical was dead and buried - and eulogized and gone. - Right. It's still hard. Right now, it's hard to get the movie musical back on its feet again. But every generation has something that at least keeps the flame alive. And it's interesting how beloved this is. It trumps all the other projects. It was the one that everyone attached to emotionally. And when you think back, - how young and innocent we were. - Innocent is the word, I'd really say. More so, at the time, I think, we were sort of, "Gee, this is kind of edgy for a Disney movie. “This has some things that's never been done, "and Louis the chef and those things.” But you look at it again, and this is so sweet and so innocent. But not even just the film, I think the atmosphere in which it was made, there was an atmosphere of "We're behind the eight ball, gotta get the movie done." It's usually, "Go faster, you're behind schedule.” And yet, we didn't have the weight of Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, and all those other things, it was like, we wanted to do a fairytale, we had the weight of Disney fairytales behind us. We'd all like to do something that lives up to that legacy, and that was imposing, but there wasn't cynicism about, "We have to repeat this, or we have to avoid this.” It was just do what we felt seemed right for it. And you just went with your gut, and I think it was very innocent that way. And everybody was young. So this is John MuskKer, thanking you for joining us on this little trip down memory lane, and hope you enjoyed The Little Mermaid as much as we enjoyed making it. And this is Ron Clements, thanking you for listening to this and watching all this. And hoping that you learned a little more about the making of this film that's certainly very special to me and to all of us who worked on it. This is Alan Menken, and I want to tell you what a pleasure it's been for me to share this time with my collaborators here, and sharing memories about The Little Mermaid.
