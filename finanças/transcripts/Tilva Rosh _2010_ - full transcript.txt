Just to take a pic. Don't! Go away. Just put it on my head. Toda, wait for me. Why did you get so pissed off down there? I wasn't pissed off, I just didn't want you to take my pic. How come? Sometimes I don't want to. Ok, but these days I'll sneak a pic of you. Sneak a pic? Than listen to the words of the song Stefan and I are going to sing for you tonight at Karaoke. Move your leg, Toda. Ok, then I'll put it on the bed with my shoes on. Just move on How am I going to find this now? Steki, play some music. That's not plugged in yet. I need to unpack my stuff, man. What are you looking for? A disc for Steki. I must have taken it out so I can give it to you. I'll just have a look in the living room. It won't work I don't know how, anyway. This music sucks. Look at these butterflies, dude. Did you see these retarded figurines? Did you see these discs? Check out this one. Be my baby, Magic Road, Another Day... And you'll take music like this? Toda Come, come closer. We don't understand you She asks you about the perfume. Granny huh? Her French granny? I have no idea. We found it Steki. Here you are.

I don't know dude. Hard times, man. Fuck, and I don't feel like going at all, dude. You are all staying here... Dunja came back from France after ages... Oh man, Dunja again. You started getting on my nerves. You've been full of shit lately, dude. Yapping all the time about her. The girl is a pain and that's all. It doesn't look high at all. Well, everything looks smaller on the camera. It looked so high from up there. Nevermind, I figured some 10 more stunts we should do till I go to University. I got some needles I'll pierce my cheek, and you pierce whatever. After this karaoke tonight, you could do something with a grater? Grate my knee? That's cool. You could put a bucket on your head and I could hit it. We could take that Mekica's metal bucket. With a fist or with a bat? We'll figure it out. I could hit you in the stomach with a rubber ball. That's good. It's cool, we'll figure out some more stuff. So around ten stunts? - Hi. - Hi Marko. Bring me that notebook from the table, please. - There are two notebooks here - The brown one Uhuh. Did you find it? Give it to me. - Have your dinner. - Ok. What is it? Spaghetti? Wait, let me see... I need Mira. - Do you want to become a member? - A member of what? Of Herod Multilevel.

And I still need 18 more points. - It's these boxes, right? - Yeah, what do you say, Marko? C'mon, imagine me become a member? Why not, son? Imagine me going here and there, talking to people... No. Look. I'll explain it to you. What? Well, look. Look how it works. These are the points and these are branches, this is me, this is your father, you see... So what, they're spreading around like a sect or something? It's not, c'mon... - And when did you get that? - What, this? I fell down, but it's nothing. Now your hair won't grow there anymore. C'mon, it's just a small scar. I have something fantastic for that. Here, look. Herods heel cream. It's great for the scars and burns. So I would have to sell that heel cream? Here, nothings wrong with that. Here, smell it. It's completely natural. What? I have to rub that heel creme on my head? If it's called a heel cream then it's for heels. Your hair will grow again if you rub it. I came here to eat and now I'm not hungry anymore. - You can paste it on the bread. - You really can. Hair will grow on your heels too. You came, awesome... - Hold the camera. - Come on, hurry up. Hold the skateboard. Don't step on me dude. You're aways late dude It's not me who's late. When was I late when I was coming alone?

Awesome Mekica, you ok? Damn man we go! So wasted Kina boy! Here's your body. You're a retard. Why am I a retard? Ok, Marko, I'm your counselor while you're at the Employment Service. - You finished high school, right? - Yes. I am an electrical technician. - You were not fond of school, ha? - Well, that depends on how you look at it. Neither was I. I was also skipping lessons. I suppose you don't have working experience? No, no, I've never been employed so far. Do you have any idea what you can do? Well, I have... vaguely... Try to think about that. People who finish high school like yours have a trade. So, it's easier to get into the job market. You have to know something before that. You have to know... How to present myself? How to present yourself to the employer. And you do that through your CV. Do you know what a CV is? Well, I do... it's like a biography... All right. There are some small workshops. There is an instructor who teaches the unemployed and you can ask him everything you want to know. It's much easier than in high school because there are twelve hours in each group. I mean, twelve people... Are those workshops compulsory? They are compulsory if you want services of the Employment Service. I'll use this graph to explain to you now Herod Multilevel Marketing functions. Well, imagine yourself in this position here. You recruit new members, and for each new member you get 20 points. However. Marko, come here for a second... Just to drink some water. Excuse me, please. Do you remember my son? Hello. Hi Toda. What's up Mare. You were queuing at the bureau?

And this shit here is even more crazy. This is a mixer. Everything goes through it. One day even decks maybe - When Mare gets a paycheck huh? - Yeah - And this bro? That's a compressor, it's totally awesome. Huh? What do you think? One - two - one - two we're at Shorty's, me and you. My guest star is Toda. Where's our man Mare? Did he go to work? No, not yet, but he's shitting like a Turk. Man, how much does all this gear cost? - We bought it for 400 euro. - Where did you get the money from? I worked for Frikom ice creams, and Shorty also worked for some guy. - No way. - I work for lnterex now. Cool. Wanna come? Sure, just to finish this. You weren't at the party last night? Nope, I didn't feel like going out. I'm so bored, dude. And the stuff I was shooting with Stefan... Fuck, You'll get sacked again, I've just broken this. You know the stuff Stefan and I were taping? I dunno if wall finish it. He's leaving for Belgrade... and I have to go to that Employment shit every morning. What's this? Your turn to roll. Well, well, nollie... How's you mom? Yeah sure How's my mom? No really, she rocks. Last year we went together to that shitty employment stuff. Yeah You went there together I remember. She's dull. There's many more people now. The whole town is in the street, huh? Turn that thing down, I can't stand them anymore. There's no messing around with you guys, huh? Hey dad, here's that big truck... Dumper Dumper? You know, I saw it when I came to your work that day. I was walking next to it. It's huge. Do they use those trucks to bring you the ore to the smelter? No dumper is for excavation. They use a train to bring us the materials we use for the smelting mixture. -By train? -Yup. And wat's that mixture? It's a mixture of ore and some melters. Melters? Like quartz, it stimulates the melting of the ore. And then the wagon gets under this roller. What's a "roller" now? It's like two huge wheels between which the whole wagon can fit, And then the wheels flip the wagon, what was up, now is down... And the ore falls down to the bunker. Like a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Then the elevator brings the mixture up to the conveyor belt. There we add some more elements to the mixture Do you use the conveyor belt for running? We do, come, we could run together. I could lose some weight. Then the mixture goes to the reactor. And it gets fried in there. Fried? Yeah, the sulfur burns, we even pump in the air so it fries even better. And from that you get the fried ore. Fried ore? Wait, do you work in a smelter or in a kitchen? Fried ore, hah. Fried ore. It's better to work there than to sell creams. Who sells creams? I don't sell creams. I don't work in smelter either, I'm just registered there so I could get social insurance. Who told you about the creams? Your mum told me. What did she say? I told her that I'll sign up if she won't tell anyone. I just signed up just so that she could get some points I didn't sign up to sell the stupid creams. I know, come on. Yeah, but she told you, and she promised she won't! Hey! Easy! Easy boy! Where's "delete" here? Don't delete the photo, look at the face you made! This iPhone is bullshit. What are you talking about? Do you see how good the photos are... Wait, I have a message from Toda. Wow. Can you tell me why the fuck you are still pissed at me? Because of the bucket? - I wasn't pissed because of that. - No? Come on, think of some fucked up stunt for me and we're even, ok? I already did, man. I should have guessed. Hold on Toda, dog! Come on monkey! Toda! Toda! Hey, dog, you alive? He's fucking with us! This looks great. I almost fell here. It'll be even better when I edit it and with the music and all. A few days ago some chick contacted me She liked the trailer and she has something to do with MTV Adria. Ha, no way Hey, you! Shut up when elders are talking, you monkey. You have a monkey on your pants Listen, there's that bald fuck that beat you up, Toda. It is him, his car broke down, hah. Let's beat the crap out of him. Don't. Why should we beat him up? Are you serious? Really, are you fucking serious? I am, why should we beat him up? Man, he beat you up! He beat me up, so what? He jumped on all of us if he jumped on you. Man, we're a team, we're all gonna beat him. I won't. Hey, come here! What, we're gonna fight for you and you'll watch? I don't wanna have nothing to do with it! Dude, there's the guy... I can't fuckin' believe it! I'm gonna fuck him up. Hey baldy! Come here, motherfucker! You run away you pussy! Come here!

What's this about? - You should apologize to our friend! - To whom? You don't know whom, huh? Where's Toda? Toda! What's going on, Toda? I have no idea. Stefan's being a smartass again. He wants me to beat that guy up Toda come here! Wait, I'll go and see what they want. Ok, I'm here. - Now apologize to him. - Why? You wan! Me to show you why? Apologize to the guy. To apologize how? Easy, just say "I'm sorry". Ok, sorry. That's not good enough! - How come it's not? - Say it like you mean it! Ok, you want my mobile, what? Here, I'm sorry. Dude, is he fucking with us? Feel what you're saying, Say "Sorry, I was a retard", or something. Say it nicely. There's always the other solution, you know. Where are you going? Toda! Wait! You wait here, I'll be back. Wait! What's with this? "I'm Toda, the gentleman, I don't fight" Very nice, very nice, you're great. Toda jock. Always on the level... Fuckin' Dalai Lama! Watch out there's an ant, don't step on it! You're full of shit! I might be, but you are fuckin' Dalai Lama! Oh, look at Bruce Lee, you're so strong, dude! I can't hear you! Now I know why you didn't want to fight that guy... You'd kill him with one punch! Stop Toda! Stop, I didn't want to chase you. - Explain! - I won't. What you don't want? If you listened to me, you wouldn't go fight. Like when I say something to Mekica, for his own sake, that's why I said that to you... And that thing with Dunja in the woods, that was for my own sake? Look at the truck! Cheers for the boy on the police car! Hey kid, no ride in here! - Sorry? - No ride in here! Just to tape this ride. No taping! I'm taping, c'mom? Get the one with the camera. Over here, come, to the back door! Hey, guys, here's Mare! Hey, you lost your minds? - Open up! - Beat it you monkey! There he is! Get away You're screwed now No, my elbow, it hurts. I don't care. You know, you really pissed me off the other day. When you whacked Stefan in the head. I didn't hit him as I should have. And you cried! I saw you. It was wind. I got something in my eye. You were crying. You were sorry. Steki! Don't listen to her! What? Toda was crying the other day! He cried, he was sorry! Pussy. Hey, look what you did to me! You ripped out my player cord, fuck! Here you ave Here's your beer. First I'll take a leak and then drink the beer. - Watch where you go. - Get lost. Toda, did you see? Wherever's a protest there's a riot! Dunja stole 2 kilos of oranges for us dude. A hell of a thief! What now? As if it matters. Who's thief? You're so full of shit. And why are you pissing with the door open? So what if I piss? It's better to piss than steal. - Give it to me. That beer's cold. - That's why it's for me. Thief. Admit it, you stole the oranges. As if you never stole any fruit from your neighbors. I did, but it was my neighbors' fruit. You've been stealing Pez till recently. Ok, I stole but I admit it! So then, what's this trip, dude? As if it matters whose oranges they are. And stop hitting that against the table. As if I'd scratch it! Ok, I'll stop then! Like I didn't have the money to pay for them or what? I don't give a fuck about your money. What's your problem? It's not about that. I didn't steal them. I'm not a thief, you jerk! If I wanted to steal something I'd take something more expensive. You stole them. Just say you stole them. - Ok, drop it, will you? - Drop it? Why? - As if it matters. - It matters. So you care a lot about these oranges? I do. - Because she didn't pay for them? - Yes, exactly. Just say "I admit - I stole them" and that's it. I won't. I wasn't stealing. Just admit it. Such was the situation! No, it wasn't. It was, you're full of shit! Say it Dunja. Say "I did it!" I won't. Why? Because I won't. What's wrong with you? You're full of shit! I'm not! She won't admit it! She stole them! Does it matter? It does It doesn't. It does Doesn't. Why doesn't it? Why does it? Ok, if it doesn't, then bye. Who cares. At least, he left his beer. And the oranges too. - Hey, what do you think you're doing? - What now? You said it didn't matter whose things were. You said it yourself. And I then thought why not smash your car a bit then? You gonna smash my car? I'll smash you, you fuck? Poor throw... What do you think you're doing? What? Look what you did, you stupid monkey, look what you did! Hey dad So now you're up to smashing supermarkets, huh? Hey, dad, I thought you could do this better. How did you come out like that? What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you? That was better! Shut up you idiot! I will shut up, ok! Here you see? I saw a dumper at the protest today. TILVA ROS part four TILVA ROS part four So Toda Mladen. Mare So... Toda and me. And the two of them. Why? So that we can beat up each other Great That's it. Marko Todorovic is the champion of today's tournament. Here comes Marko Marko, you want to say something? Well, not really. Only that I'm the best. Ok, today we'll try to apply our skills we've gained in the workshops so far. Today you'll have an opportunity for the first time to see how it looks like to be in a real situation which we'll set up through a game. So, I'll pick up three of you who will be on the Board of a big company and who will decide if you'll get the job or not. So, their task is to go through your CVs, pick an applicant and interview him about his potentials, his knowledge and skills gained so far and his qualifications in general. So, Petrovic, Staletovic and Jankovic. Please bring your chairs here, And I'll... I'll put this chair here and I'll give them the CVs that you were writing these past several weeks. Here you go And the most important aspect of this game is to see all the advantages and disadvantages of a job interview which can be really stressful for an applicant and you can see how the Board works and decides about your competence and characteristics. Ok, that would be it. And now I'd like to ask the Board to start. First, I'd like to thank you for choosing us and second to congratulate my colleagues and directors for being... Shall we do it by this order? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Marko Todorovic. Please, sit down. Thank you. Ok, so Sir, before we look at your CV can I ask where did you get those bruises from? I was skating and I fell off. You're sure? It wasn't anyone's handwork. No, no, well, it was my own. Let's see how you did. Colleague? Consultant? Will you tell us why you submitted an empty paper? I forgot my pen. - That's your excuse? - Yes. Well, you see Mr. Todorovic, we don't know what to do. But since you're the first applicant, let's not be strict, let's be flexible. You want this job, you're all bruised, you submitted an empty paper... well give us some argument... why we should take you. What are your qualities? Tell us something to convince us you are the right one for this job. Perhaps I could convince you like this. Get out! Shame on you, get out! Well, I thought this could work. Have I convinced you? Ladies and gentlemen, this is how you won't get your job. I fucked it up, I parked the car near the protest... Some kids, hooligans. It happened last Wednesday... Listen, I have the glass. It's not for that model... Have you shot it already? Get a bit closer. Why are you standing like that? See ya Have a nice rip. Thanks So, come back next year, what can I say, we're here... Let's go. You found a place to live yet? I have. So, when are you leaving? Well... On Friday, my lectures start on Monday. This Friday you're leaving right? Nice... And when will you come back again? I dunno it, I have any free weekends But most probably, during the winter holiday. I'm thinking of us taping some stunts during the winter holiday. Great, great, great, great. We could have our faces dragged against the ice or something. I'll think of something. There's enough time. We'll think of something. What are you gonna do? Dunno, find a job, I guess. You? Don't make me laugh.
