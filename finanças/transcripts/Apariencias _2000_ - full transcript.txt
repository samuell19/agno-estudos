Hi. Good morning. How are you? Drop by if you want to, ok? Sure. So... I'll give you a call. He's been kinda... withdrawn Lately More than ever. And to see your own flesh and blood like that is rough. I don't really feel Like doing anything anymore. You know, his Living upstairs, more than bringing us closer has pushed him away. I feel Like going upstairs and beating the Living shit out of the bastard. Suzy! Ok, sorry! My gut tells me the kid has relationship problems. Of course I have trouble relating, what else is new? But that's not the main issue... what's important here is that e-mail. Go ahead, read it. That address you passed on was more useful than you can imagine. The furniture is just great. Tell you all about it when I get to Buenos Aires. Veronica. Is this it? Who's this Veronica? The Love of my Life, only she doesn't know it. Hence, she's not my girlfriend. She's the Love of my Life. And that's why you just took off Like that? Yeah. That's why. To understand that a normal girl with no boyfriend, could one day be my girlfriend... and to Learn that maybe, sometime in the future, I could just maybe be her boyfriend. And how does one go about Learning that? Taking some classes. Taking classes? Learning to cope with open spaces a problem I've had since youth. What's wrong? Why are you Laughing? Serious, don't Laugh. There're courses people take, people with problems in the... the passion department. Look. What? Mental maps Nah, give me a break! Why not? They're courses. 4 wheel drive, SUV. I need to face up to my phobias, Learn to Live with them. And, these things are done... through isolation, Like I did. Watch me breathe. Check me out. ALL thanks to mind control. Beto... I got my lungs full of Love. I know, you think this is all crap, don't you? When did this girl show up? Sorry, mind if I take this chair? Yeah, yeah. Wait. I'LL give you a hand. Charlie! Make 50 copies and get them to Financial Management. What was that address? I'LL be back in 30 minutes. I'm ordering out. Anybody want anything? Who wants to chip in for the present...? Welcome. I'd have Loved to talk to her but couldn't get up the nerve. But Luckily, Beto... a warm rain saved me. And that's when it happened... Daddy! Daddy! Cause she was starting to be important to me. Very important. I Love walking in the rain. A woman who's not embarrassed to walk in the rain... fits right in with me, Beto. That's it. No doubt about it. A person not ashamed of being called a snob or an idlot... is someone smart. You know how it felt Like? To be walking there, the two of us? Water running down my face... I'd never felt Like that before. And at some point I started hearing this music... I'd never heard before. It was Veronica's music. Did I tell you her name's Veronica? C'mon, Loosen up, relax, breathe Like you did before. There you go. Don't be ashamed of loving a woman. You walked with her in the rain.. you walked in the open air, you almost had her, almost... did'ya tell her anything? I said something very important.. Do you want to have some coffee? Sure. As soon as I get back from my trip. Bye. She was supposed stay working for an agency in Miami for 15 days... and stayed on for three months. Now she's coming back. She thanks me for the tip I passed on over the net. And since then, zip? No phone calls? No, barely. Nothing. Actually, nothing at all. I kinda found out by chance date and time of her arrival... so as soon as she steps on Argentine soil... I'LL be there. Aw, c'mon, hold it. What does "as soon as she steps on Argentine soil" mean? What don't you understand? Richieri... Pistarini... Ezeiza Airport. As soon as she steps into the main hall, And when does she get here? Now. Do you reallze it's the most moronic thing to do? Besides, it's corny, childish. A man can't stand there, waiting at the airport... to tell a woman he Loves her. Only a screwed up mind can think up something Like that. A normal guy doesn't do this sort of thing. Well I do. Then you're abnormal, man. What can I say? Want me to go with you, you dope? No. I gotta do this all on my own Besides, I don't need a sidekick telling me what to do. I'm going on my own. Thanks for coming. Really. Everything's cool. Relax. There she is. Don't Look. That chick? Which one? No, a mistake. What a dummy. Cool it. Why don't you breathe Like they taught you in those... fucking courses you went to? I am breathing. Well, deeper. One, two, come on, easy. Come on, nothing can come as a surprise. Nothing can catch me by surprise. Carmelo? Carmelo. Oh, hi. How are you? Fine. I've been watching you from behind for a while and wasn't sure. Yeah, happens sometimes. Right? Sure, so I said that's Carmelo Ponce and I've got to say hello. No. No? No, it's not Ponce but Posse with double "s". Carmelo Posse. Of course, Carmelo Posse. Thanks for that tip on the furniture. It's great. Oh... What are you doing here? What am I doing? No... my friend Beto's going to London and I came to see him off. Oh, you're going away. Of course. Have a good trip then. I'LL have to Leave now, I've somebody waiting for me, ok? C'mere! Excuse me? I mean. Come here. I'd Like to say something. It's just a minute. That's all. Yeah, sure. Just give me a sec. Fede? I'd Like to introduce you guys. This is Carmelo, a friend. Federico, my boyfriend. How's it going? How are you? Beto, on my way to London. Honey, sorry to interrupt but there's a group at the door... protesting against a rock band. We should get going. Sure, but Carmelo wanted to tell me something. No, no. I was... just... No, no... it can wait. So then we'll be on our way. See you Later. Bye. Have a good trip. Bye. You gotta Look ahead. Gotta value the fact you came all the way out here. I know it got all screwed up, but, to tell you the truth... as your friend, I'm real proud of you. Honestly, Carmelo. You can't Let your world come tumbling down... just because the girl you Like has a boyfriend. Seriously. Hold it. Watch it. Careful. Don't touch me, man. What a bummer, why did we have to end up here? We were beat by our anxlety. You're right. Anxlety beat us. Swear to God we arranged for it to be peaceful... but with these people it's impossible. They always treat us Like animals. I'd have to be deaf not to hear you. How do you want us to keep calm when this rock group... is set on offending all the gay community? Don't you agree? I mean... cool. You can disagree. It's not necessary for us all to agree. No, no. Yeah. I mean, I do agree. What's more... when you're up to your neck with something... you should react right then and there, right? Carmelo? Are you okay, Carmelo? No, I'm not okay. And not because we're stuck here or because we came. I'm not okay because it upsets me to think... some decisions are Like a drowning man's final Lifeline. Just because... one is different from the rest... Because our time is the same as anybody else's. I shouldn't have waited so Long. Things have to be said from the start. At the right time. Only then... can someone really Listen to a declaration of Love. What you said was very nice. What's your name? Could you Load them all onto the bus? Let's go. Who is that? It's a guy from work. Veronica, don't tell me you didn't know he was gay. No. But it's obvious that when it comes to defending his rights... he participates actively. I hope nothing happens to him. I think I'm old enough not to have to account... for every step I take. Yes, sure, of course. But your journey to the USA was supposed to Last 15 days. It turned out to be three months. I went to work, not on a picnic. Yes, sure. Work. But you come back from your trip... with a young man we hardly know and you knowvery Well... that it's in reiteration that people might get intimate. Please, Let's not mix that charming young man in all this. The only one who should pay her dues is our daughter. No one else. What are those dues, dad? If the cultural upbringing you received is of any good, you might remember... that in old opaque crystals, the great Bernard Soler already spoke... of the emancipation of immature young ones. You can't deny that. I don't remember nor care to. Don't contradict your father. I am getting married. Period. Not even in dreams. It's my Life and I shall do as I Please. I'm set on it. Are you really? Well, then... we should organize the party right away. No. There'll be no party. Nothing. It'll be a simple ceremony. That's it. Honey, Let's do the party as your mother wishes. I see you're your old selfish selves. I'm getting married. Don't meddle with me nor Federico Butt out. Hon... Don't worry about me 'cause I'm doing great. I'm keeping my head clear and keeping busy... Listening in on my workmates'conversations. Veronica is a thing of the past. Hi. Hi. Welcome back. Do they really know so much about marketing? We didn't think we'd see you again. Things got complicated. Will you be working here again? No, although I haven't finished what I started yet. I wanted to see Carmelo. Is he in? He's probably in his kennel. What are you doing? Huh? What are you doing down there? No, nothing... Looking for this pen I can't find. Look, the pen. Nuts. Hello. Hi.Everything okay? Yes. Everything's fine. I wanted to see you... and bring over this knickknack because of the e-mall and all. For me? Do you Like it? I Love it. What is it? It's an hourglass. Yeah. I didn't reallze. An hourglass. Of course. It's for the time you saved us and also... so that you keep in mind you don't need to waste your time... appearing to be something you're not. Excuse me. What is it? Has he kidnapped you? Finish your hellos so we can wrap up your pending issues. Hey, I can't believe it. If this chick came by to see you and gave you this shit... it means she cares for you. She's dating. I've got no chance. What do you mean? Of course you've got a shot at it... otherwise she wouldn't have gone to see you and given you this. Call her up. Are you nuts? How can I call? With what pretext? Call her. Think I should? You bet. I'm so happy you called. You've cheered me up. I'm glad. I wanted to tell you the hourglass you gave me is a hit. It's a piece of shit, don't Lie to her. No, I mean to say I really Liked it. You touched a soft spot. Would you Like to get together? There's something I want to talk to you about. It's important. Sure. ALL right with me. If it's okay with you, how could I have a problem with that? Tomorrow, before dinner... we could meet and have a drink. There's this place I think you might Like. Sure, tell me. No, I don't know it. Yeah, I... no, I don't know it. Okay... Perfect, see you then. See you tomorrow. Way to go my man! Home run! ALL set! Change the subject! Close the record store! That chick is all yours my man! No, no, no. I'm gonna take it real easy. I'm not gonna get excited. Last time I did it didn't go very Well. So this time, Carmelo takes it easy. I'm gonna breathe, relax, cool it. And you know what, essentially, Betito? What? I Will not get all worked up. Take it easy, relax, you got her. I'm gonna hang out and have a drink while you go Look for her And if you need anything, come and get me. Tell me the time... oh, my God. Hi, how are you doing? Nice place, huh? Lots of people. Good place. Get rid of this prick. Maybe you can help me... I'm Looking for, uh... this girl, Veronica Ortiz... kinda redhead... don't know if you've seen her. Mimes don't speak, you dope. That's their main quallty. Thank you, buddy. You are the best. And you... don't get distracted. Go Look for her. Come on. I'LL wait for you here. Have faith. Go get her. Hello there. Carmelo. It is not a place for weirdos, dad Besides, we have a Lot of pending issues to discuss. We can't do it at home, there's always somebody dropping by. This is a modern place. The food's great, that's why I chose it. Don't be bigoted or old fashioned Please. No, don't come right away. I gotta meet up with a friend first. Ok. Carmelo. How are you? What a surprise. You doing okay? Several of the guys told me you were here but I wanted to see for myself. You are...? You don't remember. No. Ezeiza. "KiLier Chickens". Oh, yeah, the airport. Got kinda rough, hu? Yeah. But at Least it was good for reinforcing what you said... I Loved that phrase: "Our time is the same as anybody else's". Loved it. Great. You didn't mind our publishing it, did you? Huh? Want to come over to our table? I'm with that group over there. It's cool, you wanna come? No, no... I'm over here... Well, if you do... see you... Loved it. And Let's keep fighting discrimination... we almost got them. Yeah, sure. We got them. Fuck. It's me. Hi. Hi.How's it going? Fine. Could I get an autograph, Mr. Gay Leader? Yeah. I could explain all this. I don't need an explanation. I saw you the day I arrived. Yeah, we saw each other. No, I saw you Later, with the police and your friends. Yeah, but I'm not gay. Could you Please turn that down? Anything for you... Carme. Hey, Carmelo. I'm not gay. You make me Laugh. Seriously. I hope to keep these good vibes going if we end up together. I don't get it. I asked you to get together... in part because of your professional quallties. But essentially for what I feel for you. I think that's the main issue. To me it's the biggest issue. To me it's the final issue. I need to finish up the report in order to get paid for it... as soon as possible. And I'd Like you to help me wrap it up quickly... something I can't do on my own. You're the best in the agency. You're saying we should work together. Sure, I want to hire you. You'd obviously be getting part of the earnings. Thing is I wanted to talk to you about something else. No, at Least answer me that. The only person I can do this with, is you. Why with me? Because, being with you feels good. Because, I Like you.Because... I feel we can have a relationship where... there'II be no hysterics nor double entendres. Carmelo I don't have much time Left. Why not? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I'm getting married and moving to Los Angeles. Fede and I got everything set up. We even have furniture, thanks to you. It's kinda embarrassing to admit, but... Federico wrote that thank you e-mall on my behalf. Oh, Federico wrote that? Do you understand why I need you? I'm very glad I ran into you. I hope nobody runs into me now 'cause I need to go to the john. Excuse me. We're Leaving. What happened? Everything went wrong. She feels sorry for me. Sit down. Why does she feel sorry for you? For being a homosexual. She's a homo? Tell you the truth, I'd have never guessed. No, no. What? I'm gay. What?! You. Me? No, the two of us. She saw us at the airport. With the police. She thinks we're gay. And you denied it, of course. I couldn't, she just came out and I froze up. Besides, she's really supportive of my coming out. Coming out of what? The closet. She thinks I'm the sensitive gay in the office. Look at me. Sensitive gay, I wanna die. Besides, she's getting married. She wants me to work with her because she thinks I'm good. Because... because I'm gay. Besides, everyone says hi, "Hey, Carmelo" "Hi, Carmelo" I'm desperate, Beto. To say that sort of bullshit, better keep your mouth shut. Say something. I can't believe it. I don't know why I ever Let you talk me into going to the airport... Me? Right. It was my idea. It's that I'm not gay. I'm definitely not gay. Thank you very much. Excuse me, the restrooms? Upstairs. Wait for me at the table, I'LL be right there. Impossible. It is possible. That's why she brought me to this place, full of... faggots. So that I'd feel right. There's another thing. She really does need me. Problem is she doesn't need me the way I need her. And if I really were gay? I still wouldn't catch anybody's attention, buddy. Do you mind if I call you buddy? Nah. - So, buddy, I'm getting the fuck out. No, you stay right on. Stick with this chick... and wait for the right time to tell her you're not gay. A pleasure, ma'am. I'LL exchange the "ma'am" for Elsita. I Like it much better. And I thought nothing could surprise me... and I have read some very wacky memoirs. Esteban Mariano Ortiz, with a degree in Literature, a pleasure. Carmelo Posse. How do you do? I agree with you, Posse. But, dad, he hasn't said anything! Not here, out of politeness. To say the truth, and forgive me God if I sin of bigoted... but... Well, modernism yes, but not this airy fairy nonsense, Veronica. Dad, what's wrong? Why don't you finish explaining your idea? Right, Esteban, explain. Mr. Posse and I agree this place is full of faggots, pansies. I won't stand for your talking Like that in front of my friend, whom you don't even know. It's alright with me. No, he's going to apologize! I said this place was full of faggots. And I'LL say it as often as need be. Well, Well. We've come for dinner... and to clear up some family matters. Apologize to Carmelo. Why should I? He told a friend the place was full of faggots... I heard him. Did you or didn't you say that? What? Am I deaf? You misunderstood. Although to say the truth, I believe your daughter is right. You are one hell of a bigoted person... and very authoritarian, Mr. Ortiz. To refer to us as "faggots" is very ugly. Sorry if I'm being rude, Sir. I don't mean to be. But being your daughter's friend gives me the right... to say certain things. You were disrespectful to your wife in front of your daughter. That's being a "faggot", Mr. Ortiz. To expect us to all think the way you do... or for us all to have the same Life parameters, that's being a faggot, Mr. Ortiz. To Listen in on conversations, even in passing, is being a super faggot, Mr. Ortiz. Who are you to question somebody's sexual orientation? Your daughter is a queen... and thus... she chooses who to be with. Good evening. So Long. See you Later. I Love him. I Love him. Son of a gun. Hon, the boy's home. Seems he's not doing too great, he's staggering around! Stop busting my balls, I wanna get some fucking sleep! Suzy! Okay, sorry! What?! I'm gay, Beto. No! Speaking as I did in front of Veronica's parents, in front of the whole joint, I felt better than I ever did in my whole Life. I reallzed that by changing my posture, raising my shoulders, my chin... my back straighter... people paid me more attention, and you know me, people have never noticed me in my whole Life... and today... today I felt the center of the universe, Beto. Look, for a guy to even consider himself gay, he has to at Least have gone through an experience with someone of the same sex. You think walking straight, shoulders and chin up makes you gay? What are the symptoms? How do you reallze? Easy, did you ever Like another man? No. Then you're not gay. Beto, something's happening. Help me out... kiss me. ALL set. No, I mean another kinda kiss. I mean something else. Don't take this the wrong way, kiss me on the mouth. Nah, then you are a homo, pal. Don't discriminate me, help me. I'm going through a very delicate stage. If it weren't so, I wouldn't ask this of you. Beto, you're my brother, you gotta help me. If I don't ask this of you, then who? I don't know, your old man, your dog, how should I know? No, Betito, it's you. You gotta save me, help me, I'm not doing okay. Kiss me. Don't be afraid. Okay, but, make it quick. Go. So? How do you feel? Disgusted. I'm not gay, I'm an idlot. Hold it, hold it. Gotta do it right. That's no use, that didn't help shit, can't compare Like that. Let's do something. Let's hold each other, perceive each other... Let go... it's Beto. Your Beto. That's how it is, rebellious and angelical That's how it is, sugar, pepper and salt sugar, pepper and salt Are you doing some sort of pansy act? Don Orlando is right, we Look Like a couple of faggots, man! Keep it down, otherwise the neighbors... And I thought you were sloshed, brought you an antacid. Nah, I'm okay, just hanging out with Beto doing the usual thing. God help me! No more kisses, no more bullshit, okay? What kisses? It's you who wanted to neck just now, Beto. Let's do something, if you gotta Love the girl, Love her. Period. Take the job, and spend as much time as you can with her. Watch her, pay attention, and, this guy's gotta have some flaw. Stop fooling around. Cutie pie! Vero, I should see those results as Well as the groups' opinions. Hadn't you better read the results for Tampa and Orlando? They might be very useful. Thing is if I meddle with Tampa, I'm stumped. Joke... no, serious. I get all mixed up, Lost. Same thing happened to my great grandfather, Federico, when he founded the first sisal factory in the country. He got Lost. Lost the goals of the company from sight, so my grandpa... stepped in when he was of age to save his father, see? Yeah, but... how is that reLated to my report, honey? It is reLated, Love. The deal is to find the goals of the job, to reach a final goal. Besides, you worked a Lot in Miami and there's a Lot of material there... that you're not taking into account... because of the short time you have. Well, make time. Enjoy working together, okay? Honey, if we have to postpone the wedding for a few days, done. Work comes before everything else. That principle was imposed by my father, Federico, to all the Federico companies. Thanks for the tip, honey. Well, there is just one other thing. You can't go around working Like this. Look at Carmelo, Look at him standing there, ill at ease. You have to be comfortable. I think Federico's right. This isn't the most approprlate place. There's no room at my place, and at your place I'm terrified of your father... I can arrange in a jiffy... at the hotel I'm staying in, okay? He's real smart, organized our work in a minute, he's a businessman, knows all, his great grandfather opened the first sisal hemp rope factory in the country. He understands marketing, he's worldly-wise, he's cute... Cute? He's an asshole. An asshole? I tried finding a flaw and it was impossible. He speaks English, smells good and he's Lived in LA. - So? So, then there's me. We're day and night. I shouldn't have gone to that meeting. Look, when there's no Love, that's all worthless. No Love? You don't know howthey Look at each other... I was there... if this is the place I'll occupy in her Life I'll put up with it. You know what, Carmelito? When one is as in Love as you are, one doesn't reallze all the stupidities one does. Only, I'm not in Love. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Are too. I am. I can't take it anymore. Watch me sweat. I'm a mess. See what happens when I'm the usual Carmelo, when I'm scared and don't know what to do? But when I Let go, cause that's what it is, when I... appear to be someone else, people reLate to me in a different way, I feel much more sure of myself. Carmelito, Please, the clients. I can even take care of them by letting my presumption... of queer masculinity take charge. Look, we already tried out the smooching and that didn't work... so stop prancing around, Will you? Beto, this is different, the brief adventure of thinking myself... in Love with Veronica is over, but what's not over, is this adventure of being different. If she wants me to be her gay friend, that's just what I'LL be, that's the affection I'LL get from her. If you could see for one second just how gay you Look... Wait. Can I help you? I found this CD but was told there's a Live version that's much better. Let me see. Excuse me. Tell me, how can I help you? I'm already taken care of. There you have it, allve and quiming. Sorry, allve and kicking. Here you go, although I wouldn't discard the studio version. On the one hand you have a version taped at a theater, all the people screaming, euphoric On the other, there's the peace and qulet of music taped in a studio, in your Left hand. Oops, sorry. Well, if that's the way it is, I'LL take them both. Thank you. Not at all, Carmelo Posse, double "s" at your service. This gentleman Will be taking two CDs, Please bill him, I gotta go. Sure, bye. My regards to your shrink. Wait, you're nuts, you know? Yeah, but much better off. Nuts. Life was very hard being the old Carmelo but I'LL be able to at Least... Live with this new one. Looking for a girlfriend I found a friend who Loves me as a friend... because she's already got a boyfriend. Sorry. So Long! Great guy, your partner. Yeah. Nice hotel, huh? Like it? Lots of beige, Like your suit. The room is good. Bye, mom. Bye how are you? Okay, and you? Great. Got you something. For me? You shouldn't have. It's so nice. Like it? Just a little detall missing. Can't use it on its own. Ok Let him do what he Will just don't Let him touch up those eyes Your Carmelo's a real hunk. A real waste, huh? Sure that guy's gay? Very much so, he doesn't Like women. There he comes. ALL set. The missing touch. How do I Look? Signed, Dr. Veronica Ortiz. We're all done, Love. Thank you, Carmelo, thanks so much. I am finally going to be able to take care of all the stuff I've got pending. Me too. My wedding. Right, your wedding. Going to the country to pick up my grandma's dress. Well, sure, you're not going to marry naked, hon. No, it's much more than that. If my grandma were allve, she'd be very happy I kept my promise to her. Thank you. Thank you for helping me, really. And tonight... don't make any plans. What are you going to do to me? Make you feel good. Completely, exclusively for you. Another of Federico's surprises. And Federico? Should be here any second. Anything wrong? No. I don't want you to be so lonely. Being with you I don't feel lonely. I meant another kind of Loneliness. You deserve all the best. You do too. Federico and I thought of setting you up with this guy. What? Introducing you to a guy, he's just charming, Like you are. A guy for me? No, I think you're making a mistake, setting people up is outdated. Because maybe you introduce me to someone and it doesn't work and I say, ooh, what's that? Because one thing is for me to app... to be gay, and another is for you to introduce me to someone. I don't want you to, thanks. This dinner was arranged just to that purpose. I won't sit with anybody. You're going to like Inaqui. Who? Inaqui. That's his name. He's very sensitive. He's going through a rough stage but... I think you'll feel very comfortable with him. Have you gone crazy? Please. Inaqui has never told Federico and me of his situation, but he's charming. Take it easy, he's here. Inaqui, Carmelo. You don't know how bad traffic was. The waitress is waiting for us. Shall we? Let's. Ok This place is really amazing. With Roxana we are going through a stage of... Lovesex Like when you start to rediscover your mate? For example... Last night we were having dinner, super cool, and suddenly I ask her to pass the bread. When she does, she brushes against my hand Like this, barely, I stood up super aroused, Like a panther, and grabbed her... she Loves me to grab her by the hair Like this, I took her straight to bed and we Loved each other for 3 hours nonstop. The moans and cries "My Love, I Love you so much", "I'm sorry" so many times... something that... I believe in Life there's a meaning to everything... don't you? It's Like cause and effect. Right now I'm sorta fixated on girls. Any girl crosses my path and it's... Won't Let even one get away. Incredible, huh? I think the important thing is how you feel with this. Bad. I'm not doing well, I'm doing real bad. I feel Like crying all the time and then get this euphoria attack... go out into the street and yell out how happy I am. And I feel observed all the time Look at what Roxana did today. We were coming over and in the elevator she goes... "I'm not going, I've set something else up". See? Okay, I came on my own.Alone. Women always set something else up. Excuse me. Carmelo's a real sweetheart. He's been a great support these days. Yeah, he's got something... He's ultragay, isn't he? Enough! Now you go... confront her, and tell her the truth about not being gay Come on. Go, go Carmelo! And you get used to eat it in a certain way. When it's served this way... Do you mind if I say something? What? I've somebody waiting for me. Well, what a huge success you are! Who is it? Let him join us... I mean, No, I can't, I'd arranged to be picked up at this time so, thank you very much, dinner was delicious. Good evening. Come on, honey, don't get so upset... you're not his mom. I just found the way he Left kind of weird. Come on, Vero, what's "weird" nowadays, hon? I found it very straightforward, he stood up and Left. Besides, everyone does as they please with their body. Open your eyes, Veronica, if you want to make me feel good... don't fix me up with a kook Like that. I won't Let you talk Like that about a friend. Aren't I also supposed to be your friend? Yes, of course, and I'm on your side. But you're also weird, that was very rude, nobody just up and goes. Besides I've enough weirdos in my family, I don't need any more of them around me. I also have mixed feelings. With... my family, my parents. They don't know I'm gay. What? And that's very hard to come to terms with. You're not the center of the world, Love, I also have my own problems. Besides, our formal relationship ended when we finished that damned report. And I apologize, I don't mean to generate any craziness in your Life, you have enough as it is with your family. I'm Late for lunch. Have a nice day. There's someone to see you. Hi. I'll be very brief, okay, please, don't have a cow. What are you doing here? Our meeting the other day was very strange, you know that. I was having a total fashion attack and maybe you made a mistake with me. I mean, I generally talk and behave in a certain way but with you, zip. Cross my heart, nothing. But I still want you to know that I find you a real interesting guy, super cute, on the inside. And... nothing, I just don't want to Lose you Carmelo. ALL's very well, but, you know what? Inaqui, I'm working here and you have to Leave. I don't mean to make you feel bad, quite the contrary. Please go, we'll talk Later. I need to say it now. I want you to know that... I admired you. When you stood up to say somebody was waiting for you... you stood up Like a diva. Please, don't shout. I swear, I was Looking at the sun, I couldn't believe what was happening, it was way too strong. I just wanted to Let you know that... Fine, is it out already? Bye. What did I do? I'll see you at 4:15 in the elevator. No, but I can explain, this was... 4:15. Mr. Nicosi, regarding what you saw, I'd Like to clear some things up. Mr. Nicosi, please Listen? Despite the fact that you are my boss, with my private Life I do what I can... Besides, I'd Like to talk to you about something. I'm going through a pretty delicate moment in my Life. Get in. Very delicate. Get in. Nicosi, if you're trying to intimidate me... you're not on the right track. Maybe it was a misunderstanding. I hardly knowthe person who came Looking for me. Besides, regarding the magazine, I can explain in 10 seconds if you Let me. Please... Wait. Surprise! Welcome, I'm from Finance. I'm Blanco, from Accounting. What a pleasure to have you here with us, Carmelo! I'm De Simone, from Treasury, we do this Little trip every day... it's our Little refuge. You are a goddess, a goddess! What he said in that magazine! Great! "Our time is the same as anybody else's." Look here, baby, I don't know if we'll be able to forgive the fact... Never mind, we're all together now and we want to tell you that deep down... we knew it all along! You fox! I understand him because I also have some problems at home. I think it'd be nice for you if you discovered Carmelo's deviation. I'll try to be a bit clearer. Honey, Let's see if you get us out of this mess... 'cause we don't understand shit! Carmelo has a different sensitivity, maybe he can't Let it show... sometimes it's hard for us children... to show ourselves to our parents the way we are. But we built him this Little apartment upstairs, we understand him. And he Loves you both. But, he also Loves other things. Carmelo... feels you discriminate him. Carmelo suffers untold grief. Don't you ever feel bad, because you have the best son in the world. And having a gay son is no dishonor, especially if that gay son is Carmelo Posse, the best in the world. Don't make him feel different, because he is different. And what he needs is all the family support you can give him. Maybe it's also what I need, and.. Since I don't have that... I help my friend out. It does me a Lot of good. I... have to go. No, it's okay, I knowthe way, thank you. You're hurting me, you asshole! A faggot! Carmelito's a faggot. All together, I don't understand... That was a birthday party... a vegetarian... That's why my skin's Like this, I only eat vegetables. I've been so nervous Lately. Gosh! They've Left pins all over my dress! Watch it, watch the tuxedo. Let's see a picture. A nice smile for the camera. Sure. Too high... Do you catch my drift? Hn... Come on I have to take care of everything. God, I'm so nervous! Dimitri Cherenigov wore this same design while receiving the Red Prize... for Literature in 1926 in Moscow. Superb design. So, hon, what do you think? So what do we do about the Baladinis table? Let the young Lady decide. So then I do have a say in things. No, do not offend me in front of strangers... for your insult smacks of a Lie, as Galli used to say... Please dad, enough! Now darling, if you don't care whether the wedding is fitting or not, it is not fit for me to analyze things? Now, if there is a wedding it is only fitting to have the garments fit right. You're more concerned about the wedding than I am, mom. Don't start with your rudeness. Sure, right, it must be Carmelo the Simulator... that puts these crazy ideas into her head. You've changed so much, baby. Just Like Luxoir when he abandoned surrealism. I can't stand you anymore! Veronica! What? Wait. Wait, Veronica, you're completely out of control, that's your family. Don't you ever yell at me again. ALL right, sorry. Howthings stand, right? And you won't be seeing them. I'm sure you'll be sorry about all this then. I wish I had my parents with me to tell them how much I Love them That's your story, Love, not mine. Sorry. Maybe you're right, and I'm the one who's upset and don't even know why. A fairy, a pansy... Fuck the calorie count. We have to give him an exemplary punishment. Crack his head open and then punch him with the backpack that bitch gave him! Right, right. I stayed on Late at work, a kiLier day. Very hot, I wanted to die! We're the ones who feel Like dying! That friend of yours came by, what's her name? Don't know. Veronica Ortiz. What did she say? That you're a gobbler, you bastard! She said you have this deviation, or some such bullshit, and that we have to back you up. Tell me, is that why you never have dinner? Is that why we can't talk to you? Stop! Hold it! I'm mixed up in this huge mess. I am not gay. I am not gay! And what if I were? You've got to believe me, you're my parents, my own blood. Well, but she came here and said what she said. Well, I'm not a homosexual. I Love that woman. That makes me so fucking glad. But I have the usual problem, a style that separates me from those I Love. That makes me so fucking mad! That's not new. You knew that already. So before you were abstemious and now you're gay? No! Please... Thing is I'm a coward who can't screw up her wedding because I Love her, period. She's the one who thinks I'm gay, and by appearing to be so... I hold a privlieged place in her Life I'm not willing to risk. No, I can't believe it. No, I can't believe it. I'm not a homosexual, mom. I Like women. He Likes women. I'd never Lie to you. He says he wouldn't Lie. I swear, mom. Never. Carmelo. Hey Carmelo! Just a second. Come out for just a touch, I gotta tell you something. Carmelo. Hey Carmelo! No! Don't close the window, you stink! Whenever you wanna kid us around you exude a kind of adrenallne odor. No, I don't want to kid you around. There's this problem downstairs that I'm gonna be taking care of. I'm going downstairs, because it's apparent I continue to be the same dope I've always been. Come on down! I know you're there. I've seen you! Whatever you hear or see, don't pay any attention. Stay on here, qulet, relax. I'll be right back. Don't make me go up Like Romeo! Don't be passive, okay? Come on out! Hi, tell your sweetheart to come out, I gotta give him this amazing news, you'll both fall flat on your bums. What are you doing here? Nowthat things were getting cleared up. Guess what? Why me? Share what news? Just guess. Guess what? What I came here to tell you? I haven't the foggiest idea. CLose. Are you nuts? Okay, I'll give you two choices. One: I'm gonna be a daddy. Two: I realized I'm gay. Get out of my house, now. Okay, I'll give you one shot. Just one and no more, okay? Let's see if you dare, Let's just see I wanna be your donkey, make me hee haw. Let's see if you dare, Let's just see Hello there! This is a friend. He's come by to say he's gonna be a daddy. No! You Lose, it was the other one. Let me tell you, Carmelo is amazing! Made me realize I'm gay, just Like he is. Made me see that all my Life what I feared was the tooshie! Inaqui. What? You're, you're... Yes, I am. Read my lips, I'm gay. Okay? You shouldn't have spoken to my folks, Veronica. It's way out of Line. Why is it out of Line? No, not at all. I went Looking for you and you weren't there. I wasn't planning on speaking to your parents. Then you shouldn't have. When you start improvising you screw up. It wasn't Like that. I went to see you because that thing of our "formal relationship having ended", Left me feeling very bad. Carmelo, I really care for you. That's why I thought we could take a break and you could... come with me out to the country. No, I can't. I'm stressed out. Just for two days. Come on, forgive me. You forgive me and we go together I'm going to pick up the dress my grandma wore for her wedding. It's really important to me. The person I want to share that moment with is you. Two days, please. Betito, I'm going to a country house with Veronica. I tried to deny it but couldn't, you were right. I was too wild. I'll tell you all about it. This trip will be my goodbye, I won't try to clear things up anymore. I'll go with her and then Let her get married and go to LA. Let us have some nice memories Left. You know what, Carmelo? To get married now, properly, is something transcendental to me. Get it? Sure. It's to make a commitment to the woman you Love, isn't it? Yeah, but besides that, it's to finally earn my family's respect. That, to me, is something very convenient and important too. Hello, how's it going? Hon, may your grandma's dress be the most beautiful in the world. Well, enjoy. Be on your guard, I might drop in any minute with a surprise. Bye. Bye. Your ticket? Right here. How are you doing? Fine. Ohhhh, she's here... Here, my baby... Delfina, so happy to see you, it's been such a Long time! Delfina, I'd Like to introduce you to Carmelo, he's a good friend of mine. Delfina took care of grandma. For how Long, Delfina? A Long time, Miss. I put her into the box, when she died. She wouldn't have Let anybody else touch her. That would've been her will. Same as today, huh? Grandma is Laughing with joy up there, the dress will fit you Like a glove. A Little homemade pie? What's in it? Hand chopped meat and a Little thyme and a Little onion... No. Thank you. Shall we go in, Delfina? Of course, there's a whole house waiting for you. I knowthe stage of adapting is adapting and open spaces are open spaces, but I'd Like a room facing the road, Let me explain why... I need noise or I asphyxlate, I Love the view of the country but it's much too... countryish. I feel that tree's gonna fall on my head and knock me out cold. I don't mind being next door to a bathroom, I Love the sound of the chain being flushed... makes me happy. Can you get me out of here, please? I believe Miss Veronica is waiting for you. Welcome. Yes, thank you. The room... What's there to say? You've been a Little melancholic ever since we arrived. Coming here has got you down, hasn't it? No, quite the contrary. Thing is I hadn't been back and it's getting in touch... with memories of my grandma. The house, the smells, everything I've once Lived. It hits me hard as well. For a different reason. Will you be able to sleep without the sound of cars? I'll give it a try. You'd do anything for me. Like it? Love it. You're magical. I'm sure your grandma made this dress more for you than for herself. Think she imagined me as well? What is it? I could say so many things. But I don't think this is the right time. The only thing I can say is that... I care for you very much, and wish you the very best. I hope you're very happy. Sounds Like a goodbye. Are you thinking of going? Into town... I want to take you out to dinner. Please get rid of that pout. We're leaving tomorrow and I'm really enjoying this moment very much. Sorry, I sometimes ruin things, I don't know why. Maybe because I'm occupying a place that's not mine. I mean, your wedding, your memories, they belong to Federico, not me. Didn't you know the groom isn't supposed to Look at the wedding gown... until the day of the wedding? Give me a break, that's just so old fashioned. If you Love each other, you should be together. Are you in Love with Federico? What? Are you in Love with Federico? Sure. Of course. Then I'm the one who's right. You should be together. Not at all, You may know a Lot about friends, but you know nothing about girlfriends. Maybe. I don't know a whole Lot. What do you mean, "a whole Lot"? Ever had a girlfriend? Yes. Really? And, how did it go? Fine. So, how is it that... I mean, how did you then... Because I make bad choices. Because I confuse things and always take the wrong road. That's why. Let's go. I'm sorry. Why don't you watch it? What did you say? Apologize. Apologize. Okay, sorry. We apologize, come on. We just had dinner. What's in them? Sweet corn and savory. It's okay, Delfina. Thank you, you may retire. Very well. Good evening then. Want some tea? I can make some in a second. No thanks. What I need is a phone, can I call from there? Sure, the Line's in my room, Let me pass it downstairs. You're going to make a call at this hour? Yes. Who to? To a friend. I'll go pass the Line. It's too Late to be making calls without telling me who it is you're calling. A while back you almost got into a fistfight with a guy... The thing is that... It's always inevitable that you Leave topics hanging, awaiting an explanation. You're pretty confusing, Carmelo. Is starting to get on my nerves. Then Let's go get some sleep. I don't want to polemicize with you What I want... It hasn't been a good night for me. You're an idlot, an idlot! I can't take it anymore, can't! Why? Why?! Carmelo, are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Do you need anything? Just some peace and qulet. That's all. Sorry if I just seemed too hard but... No, it's okay. We'll talk tomorrow, good night. Open the door please. I can't, I'm in the bathroom. I know you're sitting on the toilet with the lid down. So open the door, please. No. Yes! No! Open right now or I'll tear the door down. What's wrong? Nothing You can't get into this state just because of the phone. You're a smart person... you know I didn't get into this state just because of the phone. Then, what is it? Trust me, please. It's not a matter of trust. What is it about then? I'm not gay. I Lied. I tried to tell you many times, but couldn't. I even came here to find a way to say goodbye, but I can't. It's okay, I'm just a Little dizzy... I don't understand anything. I think you'll have to get used to saying goodbye... I don't think I want to see you again. Delfina, I can't find the wedding dress, I don't know where I Left it. Last night I sent it to Buenos Aires As I was asked to do. To my place? I don't understand. Yes, Miss. I did as I was asked to. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much, take care. Tell me all about it Later, okay? Yes, I'll call you. Well, thank you for everything. No tree fell on me, so... goodbye Homemade. Made them this morning. What's in them? Homecured ham, a Little chevre and a pinch of marjoram, nothing strange. No, thank you. No luck this time, maybe the next Good bye. Good bye, young man. What do you Like your pies filied with? I hate meat pies. I just couldn't find the right way to tell her. Right, you never find the right way, I forgot. Veronica... I don't know what's worse, seeing you sad or angry. I wanted to be different, I didn't want to Lie, I swear. You Lied to me. I did what I could. I tried to show you I could also be a man for you. I already have a man... waiting for me. A man that when I ask whether you Love him you take 20 minutes to answer. That's the man you're thinking of marrying? You ruined my Life, Carmelo. I hate you with all my heart. It's amazing! Veronica seems so strong, so headon, so loose... and she has a duck's blood. She's incapable of modifying her events. She's getting married! That is pusillanimous. Was! But the facts indicate otherwise. I broke down, told her everything Talked about her boyfriend. You should've seen her face. She freaked out. We kissed. You made out?! In the bathroom. You showered together? Yeah. No! It was the nicest kiss of my Life You can't imagine. And even then she's incapable of postponing her wedding, cause I saw her face when I kissed her. It was illuminated. She... is much sneakier and cowardly than I am. Hold it for a second. If you dared tell her the truth it means that you're not the wimp you used to be. And if she smooched you, it means she does have some doubts. You think so? At what time is it? What? The wedding, when is it? In 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes? That's nothing! It's an eternity! Let's get going! No! I'm not going. That's my Last word and you know me. Excuse me. Where is she? How should I know? Look, Carmelo's here. Carmelo, honey, how are you? Good thing you came. Sorry about the other night, that whole mess, sorry. No problem, you're forgiven. Sorry I don't mind Really? This is Beto, excuse me. I'm outta here. What is that buffoon doing here? How out of place. Excuse me. Exactly, he's nothing to do with our inner circle. Federico invited him, mom. Excuse me, a slight mishap with the wedding register... will make us a few minutes Late. Thank you for your understanding. Let them postpone it eternally. Want us to get rid of Federico? I have to go to the restroom, don't come with me! Relax, this is gonna take a while. Did you talk to her? No, I've pinched the wedding register. What's more, it might be called off until tomorrow. Have you gone nuts, Give it back. ALL I need is to talk to Veronica that's it. She's in the restroom. Go Look for her. Wait for her at the door, go. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? This is the ladies room. And this is crazy, you know that very well. You can't get married. We can't end Like this. You Like confusing people so they end up doing what you want them to. And don't you Love me? Sorry to contradict you, but our time is not the same as everybody else's. Good afternoon, you may be seated Well, we Shall begin... Your honor! I know that physically I could sit down... but spiritually and morally I find it impossible. Shut up, you farce! Slience please. I say I don't take a seat, because the bride here was a victim of my deceit. I Lied to her. And I feel... ashamed of what I did. I was wrong. I am not gay. But what is true... is that I Love her with all my heart. Veronica! Oh, boy, we got the majority against us. Do you know karate? No. Tae kwon do? No. Then Let's run for it. What happened to me? You fainted, didn't get married, and the police had to intervene.. So the guests would stop beating each other up. It was fun, you know. Is Carmelo all right? Was he hurt? He managed to make it in one piece. Veronica, the man who's supposed to be your boyfriend is waiting out there. Federico. Remember? Stop appearing to have everything under control and take some resolutions I can't get married. I can't. How should I know where he is? You came by to tell us he was gay turns out he's not. Besides, you were supposed to get married, turns out it's a no go. I really don't have the faintest clue of what's going on with him. You know what? We don't really ask him much because he answers whatever and we get the feeling he's fibbing big time. This time you're being square with me? I swear. Carmelo and I need to clear up some things, but it has to be in person. Susana, with the trust we've acquired... Go ahead, hon. Who the fuck knows where Carmelo is? Me. I seem to be a cold guy, but deep down I'm an incurable romantic, seriously. You know I've had the illusion you two would end up together. That's why I need to see him and that's up to you. Please, take me to him. No, don't ask me that. No. That's final. Remember why I gave it to you? You didn't have to appear to be something you're not with me. I'm trying to learn just how to do that.
