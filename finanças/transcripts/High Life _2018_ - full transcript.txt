Dad. It's okay? You are calm. Dad! I'm here, honey. What are you doing, Willow? What are you doing, Willow? One two Three. There you go. Here! A little pee. Like that. Visse it. Go. Everything is fine. Who is it? Never drink your piss, Willow. Never eat your shit. Even if it's recycled. Even if it does not look like to piss, to shit. Not at all. It's called a taboo. Your... Bo ... You weigh me, my little heart. Taboo. In any case, for me. But not for you ... Not for you. My little girl. If my old man saw me ... "Break the laws of nature ..." and you will pay the price, "little fucker." "Little fucker." Wait for me! Hold on! Come on! Wait for me! Willow Where are you hiding? In the speckled shade From the depths of the tree Spiders and centipedes Ramp on your hands Climb on your knees Willow ... The dog is hungry. Number 149, report. I removed the defective part external magnetic board. I replaced it with another that I made. To save electricity, I'm going to get rid of all the superfluity. I am aware of the consequences. The baby is healthy, and me too. My blood test is normal, my sight is stable. And even if you do not read me before a good century, I piss you off. Completed. Report saved. Valid. Extended survival system of 24 hours. End of the procedure. You're light, Mink! Barely there. Cryogenic cells deactivated. Stop, stop. So many tears in such a small body! Stop, I beg you, stop. Please, you will kill me. You will kill me, please! I'm scared, Willow. I could have drowned you, like a little cat. It would have been easy. First you, then me. These fucking images of the Earth. How can they still arriverjusqu'ici? After all this time. Looks like ... Viruses who are pursuing us. Like parasites. I hold on. I held it. I never flinch. I will hold on. She's mine. I'm hers. Shit. Since we left the solar system, it's radio silence. Nothing... Apart from these wandering images. Maybe even programmed to keep us on a leash. Make us believe to a possible return. We invented rituals. Hygiene first. Here. Kali Yuga, it is the last age of man. You know that there is always leopards behind my house? Professor, I'm surprised you accepted to come to such a cold country for a conference. Why have left your hills of Assam and answered this? Out of curiosity. You had a more serious motivation, is not it? Yes. Yes indeed. We have radical experiences in the space. Death row inmates are selected as guinea pigs. That's really how the West hope to manage his criminals? I highly doubt it. We did not tell them the truth ... What about? They will not come back. We can not even contact them. Their reports will take years to reach us. We will only be bone dust and they will darken again through space. It's almost there. Go. Standing! GREAT We were the scrap. Waste. The lie of society. Someone had the idea of ​​genius to recycle. Some had taken perpetration. Others were in the hall of death. The Agency made a proposal: To serve science And considering our ages, we had nothing to lose. At this point, we had left the solar system for three years. Still almost all alive. The acceleration creates an artificial gravitation and we are saving the discomfort of weightlessness. The body lives it better. No sedative. You are already putting too much in the water. You did not miss me, little pisser. We were lied to. And you knew it. You knew it. Doctor slut "second chance". When I met you, you were a dirty little cameo. Look now. A beautiful specimen. Dirty child killer. Finally, do you have a nervous system? Look at her! You're killing her, damn! Calm! You did not understand that nothing will ever grow in us? Wise! Kiss my ass. Dirty madam! It's dirty. Our first strawberry. Ready? Hold on. Hang on, my angel. Dr. Dibs was struggling to harvest viable fetuses. The guys just wanted their dose. And my little bonus? Awesome. Thank you. Why do you hang on to take their sperm? Even if you could inseminate a girl, the baby would die irradiated. Probabilities play against us, but when my job will have reached perfection ... So what? Are you going to fly? Except me. I kept my fluids to myself. She thought she was giving me a favor. One day... This kind of bitch. It does not seem to do you any good. More than you think. It's so degrading! You have a runny nose. I know I look like a witch. You call me all Vultura. You're good and you know it. But how can you still believe to your crappy mission? You have become the shaman of sperm. This is your new religion. It's because I am fully devoted to reproduction, Blessed monk. Are you going to seed your fields? Trike blocker. Like everyone else, I used the Box. But over time, I preferred abstinence from enjoyment. Chastity strengthened my shell. Mr. Burnes on fire. Your monk trip, it's cool. So pretentious! You surprise me. I like being here. It reminds me of the home. And the jail. It's like the army. I understand your abstinence. We can masturbate until we die. But the baisodrome, brothel, it's a bottomless pit. You use it. I made my wife promise to raise our son nicely. It makes me feel good to tell me he has a good life. Your son, he's old now. Maybe dead. This small garden teaches me to enjoy the present. There is nothing else that matters. Cherny, it's not your real name? No, a Russian instructor nicknamed me like that. I think it means "black". Why "Monte"? Your old ones are Italian? I was raised by my dog. I have plenty of paws to pace the space. Ship of shit. At 99% of the speed of light, the whole sky converged before our eyes. The impression to back off when we advance, to move away when we get closer, sometimes, I can not anymore. According to Dibs, commander is unable to handle stress. Bad genes ... His cells are eaten away by leukemia. His eyes are more sensitive radiation. All he sees is wrapped in a black halo. I have good genes. Well. Leave me alone! Watch out! We were halfway there, four years from our destination. We started the deceleration maneuver to tackle this black hole. One of the closest to our galaxy. A little. It was the purpose of the mission. Our suicide mission Class 1. Try to extract the rotational energy of the black hole. And become "heroes", we would have provided humanity unlimited resources. According to Penrose. I want to fuck you. That daube. The usual stench. It makes me hard. Tcherny went to sleep in the garden. I'm happy to be weak, to lose my blood. Shut up. Stop lying to you. One day, you will spend there. You're not as strong as you think, big ball. Who are you talking to? Its good. - You are so... - Shut your mouth! Do not tell me to shut up. You're really upset. Sometimes when I look at you, I want to smash your mouth. Your little mouth. Your silly smile. This voice! Stopped. You are going to hurt yourself. The enema is amateur work. It will still have to tie you? Go back to sleep. It's good. Fucking bitch! You are a bunch of shabby, small players. Only my crime is worthy of the name. Radiation alert Even in space, Blacks leave first. You're sick? Do you want to plug the pipe? It was his will. I forbid it. You're sick! That's what his god wants. Never do that again. Recedes. I fuck your baby mission. Your hormones are shit. It is our will that kills the fetuses. It's a stroke. Do not tell anyone. Shit, the report! He was screwed. Maybe we were too. The mission. And all the rest. Number 149, daily progress report. All systems are operational. The team submits to the experiences of the mission. Completed. Report saved. Valid. Extended survival system of 24 hours. End of the procedure. Fire extinction. Always alone Alone with my cockroach I have nobody With whom to share my black ideas Person who holds me Who is all mine I think I'll always be alone. There's nothing to be scared of. I promise you. Everything will be alright. Nobody helped me as I help you. No one will abrade my suffering. I remain alone with my remorse. What? Suck me. Please. Let go of me! What are you doing? Damn, let me go! Stopped! Help me! Leave her alone! Help! Let her go, dirty crazy! No, do not do that! Shut up! Stopped! Come on, detach me! He scared my nose! I'm going to kill him, this fucker. Get out! Come. Fucking. Fuck, walk! Do not you want to wear me? We do not go home so easily. My body obeys me. Everything is fine. I will never have children. I am sure. Breathe. Did you really kill your kids? You choked them? In their little bed? With their little pillow? And your husband? I stabbed him. I would have killed myself. I tried. They put you a plastic pussy. Dibs loaded the dose when she wanted us at her mercy. We fell like flies. Sleep for hours. Dors. I am the pilot. You can not fall asleep. Dors. You feel so good ... Perhaps this is because you never asked me anything. I have the right to take you now. Why do not you ever hold me in your arms? If I close my eyes, I know that I will feel you in me. I know it. I almost feel you. Yes. Fill me. Fill me, go up. Thank you. Here. Grow up, baby. Grow warm. Grow warm. My baby. They had me. They had me. My beautiful baby. Go. Go down from there. I hate my bed. Come on! Go back to your seat. Dispatch. You are too heavy now. Little crazy. You are too far. Shabby and misfits. That's what you were. I read all your files. You killed a girlfriend for a dog. Yes. My follette. It's a goodbye that I see in your eyes? You are a real pilot. None of us can go there. You made your choice. Why are you crying? I am touched. Leave me alone, now. Where are you going? In the garden. It's not Nansen. It's not Nansen! It's Boyse! Molecular cloud Whore! The child is your daughter. Out of your genes. She has a good constitution. Like his mother with a nice ball. For me, she embodies perfection. "I'd rather bury myself underground" after losing you rather than crying you "when you fulfill your mission." What are you talking about? That's what my wife told me. I did all this for her and for our son. To transform our humiliation in glory. She said that this mission was going back to bury him twice, that my idea of ​​glory was phony. He does not answer. It looks like ours. It is the same. The same ship. There is maybe... other people... On board. So what? What? They could help us. We do not need help. You are scared? No. It's certain? These are dogs? Yes. Did you take the little dog? I had to leave it. Why did not you take it? We could have kept it. No, we can not. I wanted so much for a dog! A little dog to cuddle. You know why. Recedes. It was dirty in there. I have to disinfect myself. He will die. It's cruel! What do you know about cruelty? You do not know. I have to wash myself. Disinfect me. Emerges. Go away from the door! Get out of there. You were right, dad. I beg your pardon. I have everything I need here. Go back, crazy. What are you doing? I pray. You know what god to pray? You pray what god? I saw it on images of the Earth. I wanted to know what it was doing. The dog is hungry. Number 149. Local day: 6750th. Earth day: 76,861th. It looks like a crocodile eye. Or a mouth that will swallow us. He is huge. We should try it. I feel it well. Do you feel it well? I thought we were vagrants. But he is so big! The density must be very low. I believe it this time. I'm sad that you erased the data. Even your criminal records. You may have been criminals, but you are my heroes. The wall of fire will destroy everything when the black hole will suck the ship. There is no wall of fire. I am sure. We will pass. You never answer my questions. I look like my mother? No. Look well. My eyes? No. My hair? Not at all. My nose? My mouth? You have rodent teeth. Like a little rat. Rats are animals very smart. Do not you think I'm pretty? You are special. So different. Like nobody. And I like it. Let's go? Yes. Subtitling:
