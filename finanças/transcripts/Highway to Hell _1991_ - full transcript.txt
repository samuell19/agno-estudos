♪ Hey, yeah ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ Well, yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ Mmm, yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Hey ♪ Hey ♪ Hey ♪ Hey ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah I thought it was the bride that... Shh! That cop is watching us. Don't point at him, Charlie. Relax. Why would he? Well, think about it. I mean, if your parents freaked out, they'd call the cops, right? I mean, what we're doing, it's... Technically, it's illegal. Don't worry about it. Nobody knows we're getting married, Charlie. It's okay. No one. Yeah. Except for my mother. You what? I'm sorry, I wrote her a note. I didn't want her to worry about me. We better get out of here. Come on. Sorry. Good dog. Well done. God, that cop is right behind us. Charlie, it's just a coincidence. Let's find out for sure. Okay, okay, okay, you were right. I was right.You know what? If your mom did blow the whistle, we'd be a lot safer takin' this back road to Vegas. I don't know, Charlie. It's just... It's dark. Rachel? What? Trust me. Come here. Mmm. Get in the car. Wait, Charlie. Charlie? Mmm? Not in a Ford Pinto. Just close your eyes and picture a Porsche. Look, I want this as much as you do, it just isn't right. Being in our own great big bed, no parents, no curfews, no frustrations. And no clothes. Uh, yes. Yes. Definitely no clothes. What do you need, son? Could you fill her up, please? Unleaded. Thanks. What do I owe ya? Gas is $8, and advice is free. You headin' for Las Vegas? Why do you ask? Well, it's an old road and needs a lot of repair. You'd be a lot safer on the Interstate. Well, we'll be all right. $8. Thank you. Back, Ben. Back. Uh-huh. Oh, Charlie. I got it. Oh, no. Thank you. I took shop in high school. Wrong car for this kind of road, honey. You always open this late? Don't sleep much at my age. It's a biological fact. Back when I had all those things in the world to do, I had to waste my time sleeping. Now, I got the hours and not much to fill 'em. You kids look pretty tired. I got a cabin out back, nice bed, clean sheets. Won't cost you a cent, and I'll guarantee your privacy. Oh, thank you, but we had our hearts set on getting there tonight, thanks. Well, listen, son, you keep your eye out for two Joshua Trees. If you get sleepy, don't pull over till you pass the second one! You hear? What was that about trees? Who knows? Guy was like really weird. He's just lonely. Yeah, well, we both know what that's like. Mmm-hmm. Navy brats see the world, but we lived like gypsies. I didn't mind that so much, till I met you. You make me feel really good about myself. Rachel? Oh, great! I pour my guts out to you, and you're asleep. What do you think, Ben? Ben? Okay, okay, okay. I'm driving through the middle of nowhere, and I'm talking to myself. Where the hell did he come from? Damn it! Jesus! What, uh, seems to be the problem, officer? What's he doing? Charlie? Charlie! Charlie! CHARLIE: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! What are you doing? What do you want? Let me go! No! Charlie! Ow! Help! Let go of me! Rachel? Rachel! Why didn't you want us going out on that road? What was that about trees? You wouldn't believe me if I told ya. What happened to your girlfriend? He took her! Who took her? Why don't you tell me? There's two roads down there. There's a road within a road. You can't see it. It's there, all right. I been there. Where? The highway to hell. The highway to hell? This is not a joke! I am not kidding! Okay, okay, okay. Okay, can you please just tell me where there's a phone? You can't phone hell, boy. You can drive there, but you can't phone hell. They're all young and every one of 'em pretty. They just didn't disappear. I know where they went. The Sergeant took 'em. Who is this Sergeant? The Hellcop. This was Clara. Pretty as the day is long. God rest her. She made me this. She could make any old piece of trash look like a work of art. This was a piece of hubcap. Way back, about 50 years ago, we drove out from Oklahoma. I was gonna find work so we could get married. She never made it. In the middle of the night, I fell asleep drivin' that God forsaken road. Did Clara die in the crash? No, she disappeared. I never did find Clara, but I've never given up hope. But you can do more than hope. You've got to catch him before he reaches Hell City. You'll need this. It's no ordinary gun. I'll get you some shells. I'm sorry I don't have any more of them. This highway to hell, how do I get there? You might get to hell in that Pinto, boy, but this one will get you back. It's beautiful. You better take this antifreeze. It's got to be hotter in hell down there. It's all right, Ben. You know, you're gonna have to pass through to the other side by sunrise. If you're not back in 24 hours, you're stuck there for eternity. You know, this whole thing is really my fault. She didn't even want to take that road. You just drive back and forth between them two trees. Believe. Really believe. That'll pass you through. Good luck, and Godspeed. Hey, I forgot! Son! There's somethin' in that car, somethin' special! Okay, okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Now, then what's the... Where is she, you son of a bitch? Oh, shit.Shit! I believe. I believe! I believe! I believe! I believe! What year did you say that car was? Jimmy? Come in, Jimmy? What year was it? Come in, Jimmy. Stay, Ben. Well, we're not in Kansas anymore. Who are you? Where are you taking me? Sergeant Bedlam. What a fine surprise. Hello. Perhaps I can interest you in an omelet. Okay, in a bit of a rush. I can understand that. I'll just cook you up a fine head cheese omelet. Hey, Hellcop. How ya doin', sweetheart? Hot enough for ya? Gonna be a real scorcher today. Oh, I remember when I was a little girl, it was so hot, my parakeet got stuck to the bars of its cage. Poor little fella. He just melted. We had to scrape him off with a spoon. Did I ever tell you about my third husband Klaus? He caught me in bed with another guy. We were going at it pretty hot and heavy. Just want a touch, that's all. And I says to my husband, I says, "Don't worry about this guy lying on top of me. "It's okay, he's a doctor!" To the rim, to the rim. That's a joke. A funny joke. Well, laugh, if it's funny, laugh! Coffee please, coffee. Well, honey, why didn't you say you wanted coffee? We got java, we got mocha java... Get out of the way. Mr. Hellcop, can you do this? Hey, there's something behind you. Boo-boo-boo-boo. I got his mud! Get out of my way! I got his mud! I got his mud! Who needs mesquite when you've got concrete? Please, tell me how to get out of here! Uh, I don't know. But I do know that this steak has your name on it. Ugh! What? Is it that you're a vegetarian? Because I'm telling you this tastes very similar to chicken. Oh, Hellcop. Hellcop, sir. You know that little blonde you came in with. She just took off. Just like that, she just flew out. See you later. That way. She went that way. I offered her my finest cut of beef, and she snubbed me! Vegetarian bitch! Where you goin'? Would you please help me? You've got to get me away from him. Okay, okay. But whatever he's gonna do, we're gonna do it twice as bad. Don't move. Anyway, where you gonna run to down here, huh? There's only one real way out. Would you please tell me how? He sends you back to do his work. Hmm? My old lady. What? Huh? Embarrassing, big guy, embarrassing! A girl from up there getting away from you on your own turf! I mean, if he ever found out, you'd be in big shit. Tell you what I'm gonna do, okay? I'll give her back, and I won't say how you messed up. But you owe me. Deal? Hmm? Well, I'll take that for a yes. Bastard! Down here, that's a compliment. Hi, need a passenger? That depends. Can you tell me the quickest way to hell? Sex, drugs, rock 'n roll. I've gotta catch a cop before he gets to Hell City. Oh, Hellcop. Huh! Yeah. Dream on, man. No way. You just better hope he doesn't get you. Well, I'll take my chances. He's got my girlfriend. So, you need me. Why do I need you? Because I know where Hellcop takes 'em. Oh, okay. All right, get in. Well, there's just one thing. Have you got room for two? You scream! We all scream! I'm gonna scoop your brains! Now you can scoop your own brains. Hey, how about a little hot java for the long trip? That's quite a little hand gesture. Prime, grade A beef here. Raw it might be, but we can cook it for ya. Hey, hey, please, let me go! Hellcop's getting away! What's going on? You know this guy's alive? So am I.Yeah, but he's different. He's after the Sergeant, so he's dead meat anyway. Hey, come on, he just left. I gotta catch him! Come on! What's your name? Charlie Sykes. Charlie Sykes! Charlie Sykes! Charlie! Charlie Sykes, you're after the Sergeant, Charlie? You're crazy! I like that, Charlie. Why are you chasing him? He's got my girlfriend. Oh. Hmm. Okay, Charlie, but you owe me. Whether you're dead the next time I see you or not, you owe me. Agreed? Agreed.Agreed? Agreed! Agreed? Agreed! Agreed. Let him go. Clara? Come back! All you can eat! No charge! Charlie! Help! CHARLIE: Stop the car! Pull over! God damn! Shoot him, Charlie! No, Rachel, I can't shoot him with you there! Come on! Let her go! Pull over! Hold on, Rachel! Hold on! Grab him, Rachel! Grab him! Rachel, grab his head! Rachel! Uh, hello? Yes, Motorist Aid. What seems to be the problem? Oh, well plenty. My car's out of oil and won't start. Really? Really. Do you think I could get some help down here, please? Now, you're saying it's all out of oil and the car won't start? Yeah. Sounds like you're walking, geek! Get those shoes on and start doing it! Walk! Walk! Walk! Walk! Hey, that's my car! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, this is my car! Hey, no harm intended. I've got a little salvage business up the road a piece. I usually keep what I find. But since you say it's your car, do you want me to haul it in and fix it up for you? Yeah, if you could just take a look, that would help me a lot. Didn't say I'd look at it. Said I'd fix it. Not doing you any good sitting out here like a big, dead white elephant, now is it? No. Hop in. He can ride in the back with Adam. There you go. What a great dog you have. Hey, fella. What's his name? It's Mr. Ben. Adam, right? Nice to meet you, Charlie. Beezle. There you go. It's all right, Ben. Stay put. After you. ♪ Hey, yeah ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ Well, yeah ♪ Yeah Hell of a car you got back there, Charlie. I haven't seen one like it in maybe 50 years. You couldn't be that old. Feel like it. It's hard to keep track of time down here. Hey, uh, could you speed it up? I'm kinda in a hurry here. I've been tempted, but the cops down here can get pretty tough. Tell me about it. There's nothing I'd rather reach for than a fire-brewed bottle of Styx Beer. Made from the filthiest waters from our own River Styx. Styx Beer is a third more toxic than any other regular beer. The worst beer, the filthiest beer, the deadliest beer. It's Styx Beer. And now we return to our feature presentation, Bowling for Leftovers. There you go, Charlie. Right as rain. How much do I owe you? Ah, don't worry about it. Go to hell to pay. I might go for a few beers. Want to come down and sink a few? Uh, hey, no thank you. Listen, I really appreciate this, but um, I'm in a real big hurry. Please yourself. Hey, Beezle, do you know the way to Hell City? Sure. All roads lead there. You ever heard of Hellcop? Sure I have. They call him The Collector. I don't know why, but he, uh, he took my girlfriend. Is she, uh... Have you two... You know what I mean. Of course, I mean, yeah. Oh, the only reason I say is that Hellcop usually only goes for beautiful, young, uh, virgins. Well, um, she's not a virgin. We, uh, did it in my Pinto. You'll be all right then. Thanks. Come on, Ben. I was only sleeping with my husband's boss to advance his career. Next. I was only trying to help. I thought he wanted me to pull the plug. Next. Sure, I let little Frances drink the bleach, but it's a lesson she had to learn for herself. Next case. We will soon be paving the way for those who come after you. Please form an orderly line. Please stay in line and keep your complaints to a minimum. Thank you for your help. Hi, Charlie. Oh, hi, Ben. Hey. What are you doing? I'm with you now. I'm your driving partner. No, you can't, you can't come with me. I can help you find your girlfriend. How? I know where Hellcop will take her. You do? Okay. Hey, listen, you just stay out of the way, all right? It's very dangerous. Okay? Okay. Keep your excuses to yourself. We don't care. I don't care. You don't care. No one cares. So, why care. Thank you. Hey, Adam, how did you end up in hell? I was too little to remember. But you remember Cleveland, right? Look, Adam, hey, you can trust me. It was a long time ago, and my daddy was driving a station wagon. I think I was sleeping, but when I woke up, Hellcop was there. And he killed everyone except me. Even my dog. How did Beezle get you? Hellcop brought me to him. What does... What does Beezle do down here? Fix stuff. He's teaching me to fix stuff, too. This is my girlfriend. Her name is Rachel. She's pretty, Charlie. We better hurry. Listen, as soon as I find her, we're gonna get the hell outta here. Do you want to go with us? Yeah, Charlie, I do! All right, it's a deal. Cross your heart? And hope to die. Let's give 'em hell. Hit it, Charlie! Go that way! Stay. Stay in the car, Adam. Okay. Mmm-hmm, I like that. Hoffa's. Nah, Jimmy ain't here. Oh, oh, oh! Rachel! Where've you been? Are you okay? Are you okay? No, I'm not! Ow! Stand back! Move! He's here, Charlie! Shoot him again! Move, Rachel. Move! No, Charlie! Let me go! Let me go! Hello, Adam. Hello, Beezle. Where have you been? I took a ride with Charlie and I was going to come back, Beezle. Charlie made me promise. Can we still keep it? We'll see. You're leaking more than oil this time, Charlie Sykes. But don't worry, I can fix anything. Cars, people, horse races. Is he going to be okay? That depends. You promise not to run away? Promise? I promise, Beezle. Give me your hand. Paging Idi Amin! Idi Amin, to the white courtesy telephone, please. Idi Amin. Idi Amin. Idi Amin, to the white courtesy telephone, please. Idi... He's not here, go away! Get away from here, you disgusting monkey! Don't get me wrong, I love undesirables. I have nothing against... Charlie! Nice to have you back. How are you feeling? I don't know. I can't believe I'm alive. Well, you might have been killed, only the bullet couldn't pierce your soul. You've got a big heart, kid. Hey, Jimmy? Come on, let's sit down. I'm not Hitler! We've heard that story before, haven't we? Once it's explained, the devil will look at me and I'll say, "Goodbye, devil" and he goes, "Goodbye, Bob!" Goddamn it, I'll never catch up. You've done all you can. Get back in your car, go back to where you came from. There must be a million girls out there just like Rachel. No, you're wrong. She's the only one for me. Where do you think you're going? After them. Maybe he stopped. Maybe they broke down. Maybe I still have a chance. I know a shortcut to Hell City. Where? Nearby. They call it the "Road to Nowhere." In fact I'm 19! Nineteen years old! I like to listen to heavy metal. I like to sit in my room and play air guitar. I like to dance around the room in my underwear! Would you just get over it and get therapy like I did? No, I'm not Hitler and I should not be sitting at the same table with the Flintstones! I can't deal with this. Do you have a blow dryer? Do I look like I have a blow dryer? Well, you kind of do with that hair. Charlie! Hey, buddy, come on. Let's go get Rachel. Adam's staying with me, Charlie. He's my apprentice. Hey, Adam, want a ride? Hey, I thought you said you wanted to come with me? Uh-uh, Charlie. Cross your heart? I have to stay, Charlie. Okay. I'll see you around, kid. Hey, thanks a lot. He's afraid. I was never afraid. Hey, you tell me you're gonna send this little boy back up? Royce, I've told you, it's not healthy to be so angry all the time. You don't care. Of course I care. But you always walk away. Every time, you walk away. I'm going back up. Going. The winds of change are howling my name, Beezle. Howling. Don't be foolish. Oh, God, the lost boys from hell. Clara? You're Clara. Sam is trying to find you. She doesn't have much time, Charlie. Yeah, I know. Don't take that road. It's a shortcut.I know it's the shortcut. But if you take the shortcut, Charlie, you're gonna have to choose. And if you choose wrong, you're gonna be lost. You and Rachel. What do you mean? I made a choice. I was just a stupid kid. I was a dumb kid who wanted to do something with my life. He tempted me and I took it. What about Sam? I thought I didn't need Sam. Yeah, well, Rachel needs me. Maybe she doesn't, Charlie. Maybe she does. Maybe she doesn't. Baby! Oh, God. Oh, Charlie, I'm so glad you're here. Where is he? I don't know. Make love to me, Charlie. If you make love to me, the devil won't want me anymore. I don't know. I don't know. Ouch! Charlie? Oh, Rachel. Make love to me, Charlie. I don't know. Make love to me.I think we should get out of here. Come to bed! Rachel? Come to bed. I want to give you your bracelet. Oh. Mmm. Make love to me. Rachel! Rachel, we should go now. It's really only skin deep, isn't it? What the... Come here, baby. I love you, Charlie. I love... Come to mama. Ooh, baby. Oh. Let's ring bells, Charlie. Come to mama. You know I love you. Be the devil's friend, Charlie. Come on! Come on! You wanna fight, come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, you wanna fight, you ugly bitch! Let's make the sheets sing. Oh, Charlie, I'm a lover, not a fighter. Oh... Sorry, just not my type. Let's get out of here, Ben. Rachel Clark... This could be your life. Choice number one doesn't look so hot. Barefoot. Pregnant. Up to your arms in pizza pies. You look like 10 pounds of shit in a five pound bag. But choice number two, you could have it all, Rachel. Fame. Fortune. Every note... Sublime! Just have faith in us, and forget about sorry old Charlie Sykes. Sorry old Charlie Sykes. Back to the car, Ben. Ben, what are you doing? I owe you one, buddy. Back to the car. What right have you to cross? I have no right. My girlfriend has been taken to hell, and I want to save her. It's too late. Only the dead may pass. She's not dead. Please. Please, just allow me to cross. Rules are meant to be broken. But once you have crossed, there is no way back. This is your place to leave. But remember, evil has many faces, some of which are sweet. Thank you. Hey, you! Stop! Charlie, I thought you were dead. Don't move. What are you doing? Oh. Oh, Charlie, what's wrong with you? I can't explain it. I can't explain it. Mmm. Are you okay? I think you left this along the way. Charlie. Oh, my God. Charlie Sykes. Your name is not in my book. Is there a black mark on your soul? I don't know what's happening here, but I'm taking Rachel back. Rachel, my sweet virgin child, you'll never keep her away from me. You've heard her play? She can be magnificent with my help. She can do anything she wants. It is Rachel's choice. She's going back. Maybe she doesn't want to. I want to go back. We're going to die some day anyway. It's too early now. We didn't do anything wrong. We haven't even eloped yet. Precisely why I like you, dear. We're still alive. Are you sure you're alive, Charlie Sykes? Stop it, I love him! I don't really need Charlie. He stinks. Perhaps I'll let him go. No, no. You let Rachel go and you can keep me. No. Then you're gonna have to kill me. Haven't you ever been in love? I am darkness made visible. I am the Prince of Princes. I once basked in the light of God's love. Then you must know how we feel. I know how everyone feels. And it is not love. It is fear and vanity. Very well. Go. On one condition. Remember, don't look back. Now, we'll have some fun. When we get out there, stick by me and run like the devil. Charlie, come on. Ow! You okay? Don't turn! Don't look back. I think I can open this. Rachel? Rachel? We've got company. You know, I figured this out. Charlie, hurry. Get in! No key!I'll hot-wire it. I don't know. This car wasn't made in Detroit, you know. Hurry up! Drive! Go on! We're turning back! No, Charlie, no! I know! I'm turning! There's no way out! It just looks that way, Charlie. Step on it! There no... Trust me! That ought to slow him down. Hellcop! Hellcop! Hellcop! Hellcop! Wait, wait, wait! No. Wait, wait... Where the hell did that come from? Adam? Adam? Beezle? Hello, Charlie. You've made it. You're a real player. I'm proud of you. And, Rachel, Charlie's found you. Do you think he can keep you? What are you talking about? You better hurry. Friendly Hellcop is on his way even as we speak. We're taking Adam with us. He doesn't belong here. He doesn't want to go. Adam? I promised I would stay, Charlie. And I promised I'd take you with me. Remember? You really meant it, Charlie? I'll go with you! Adam, I want you to stay with me. No, he's going with us. I may not be carrying a pitchfork, Charlie, but I think you know who I am. Don't make me lose my temper. Well, we just met the Devil. One of my many, many manifestations. But you helped me. You saved my life. People live, people die. They come down here. I've got infinite levels of hell for them. What you've seen is nothing. A mere kindergarten. It's so easy for me now. People have lost their willpower, their hope. They think the world is going to come to an end. Wishful thinking. The world will last a long, long, long, long time. But you, Charlie, you haven't lost your willpower. You've got guts. That's why I like you. But you can't have Adam. Adam is not a game. Neither was Attila, Napoleon, Adolf. Adam will go back when I send him. Adam wants to go back now. And I want to take him with us. What are your terms? We'll race the Hellcop. If we make it out of hell before he catches us, then we go free. If we don't, you can keep Adam. Not interested. Me. What did you say? And me. You'll come of your own free will? Yes. It's a deal. Have you met Royce? A great disappointment to me. He was once a part of my scheme of things. Like Adam, he is one of my adopted sons. I'd like a child with Rachel. I'd like a boy. I don't always get what I want. There's your exit point. If you make it, you're free. If not, you're mine. Say hello to Sam for me. Hey, Charlie, suppose I made you quarterback of the Rams, would you give me Rachel and Adam? You know, if you'd have said the Niners, I might've said yeah. But you didn't, so go to hell. Fasten your seatbelts! Beezle? Royce, what are you doing to Clara? She's not looking well. Don't change the subject. You're letting them go. They won't make it. But you're giving them a chance. When do I get to go back up? Don't hold your breath. You owe me a chance, Beezle! What have I been doing here? I'm better than those God-fearing, sex-starved, TV evangelists! I'm the guy! I'm the best! I'm the one! You're not. You were a great disappointment to me. Kill 'em! No way! Come on, let's get out of here. Come back! Come back! You owe me! Royce, face the truth. Eternity's ours. Well, eternity lasts too long. And if that boy's going back up, so am I! You owe me! To my legions! Uh-oh, it's Royce. He doesn't like me too much. Hey, Charlie. Stop the car! Stop the car, Charlie! Come on! Go! Stop the car, Charlie! You're dead, sonny boy. You lose! Give me the gun! Stop that, stop pulling away! You're not going anywhere! The kid's mine! Let them live! Come on! Charlie? I know, I know! Hold on, Adam! Come on, we're almost there! Do it! Go! Go! Go! Here! The gun, give me the gun! Did you get him? I think so. What's he doing? I don't know. Reload! Reload! Go! Charlie! CHARLIE: What do we do? Shoot him in the glasses, Charlie! What? If you break his glasses, it'll kill him. Why didn't you tell me that before? 'Cause now I'm on your side. Reload! There's only one bullet left! Give it to me! Here! It's on the floor, get it! I can't find it! You gonna have to, get it! God, help us. Come on, Rachel! It's not under the seat! Find it! Find it! It's now or never! What are you doing down there? I see a switch, I think I know what it is! Oh, my God! We made it! We're back! We made it! Yes! We're back! We made it! I made it! Get out of the goddamn car! Put your goddamn hands up, now! Come here! You are in a whole world of shit, boy! Want to tell me what's so goddamn funny? I'm sorry. I thought that you were someone. Uncuff me! Uncuff me! - Shut up! Shut up! I mean it. Shut up! You don't understand! You don't understand! I said shut up. That's the cop from hell! He'll kill us both, damn it! Come on, what kind of cop could do that? Look at him! Stop right there or I'll shoot. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.I found it. Yes, you did. Yes, you did. Yes, you did. ♪ You were shaken by your pride ♪ No one hears your confession ♪ Now that she's gone Now that you lied ♪ Maybe the next time You'll get what you want ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Maybe the next time She won't be that strong ♪ You may find that she'll cross that line ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Haunted by your promises ♪ Lost at your own game ♪ You don't need no honesty ♪ No answer, only a flame ♪ Maybe the next time You'll get what you want ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Maybe the next time She won't be that strong ♪ You may find that she'll cross that line ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Maybe the next time You'll get what you want ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Maybe the next time She won't be that strong ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Maybe the next time ♪ Hey ♪ Hey ♪ Hey ♪ Hey ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ Hey ♪ Hey ♪ Hey ♪ Hey ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah
