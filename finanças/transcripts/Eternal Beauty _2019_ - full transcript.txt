I fought them off with karate. What? What I'm about to say is gonna sound strange, because you've taken a bit of a hit to the head, but... it's true. Okay? I'm your mother. When I had you, the doctor said... I was ill. I wasn't ill. So my sister Alice, "your mother"... took you in and adopted you. I'm your mother. That's the truth. Honest, now, no lies involved. How do you feel about that, then? - Quite tired. - You're not tired. Yeah, I am. Are you ready to come with me and meet Daddy? Don't drink that. It's quite expensive. Even I don't know where I... am. - What happened to your head? What? - I was attacked. - Yeah, he was attacked. Don't ask. - Jane! You need to understand, you can't fucking do this... - Don't shout at her, she's not a child. - Yeah, tone it down, Tony. - Tell her to stop acting like one, then. - You're acting like one. Here we go. Taking sides with her family again. It's always the same! - In other news, Mom came around. She's ill. - She's not ill. She reckons she is, and she reckons you're jealous. Filling your head with bullshit. Tony will drive you home. I'll get a cab, it's fine. - Auntie Jane has a car. - No. No, I don't. I don't have a... He's playing silly buggers because he took a... to the head. Jack, if you continue to lie, your nose will grow really large, like... this fuckhead here, Tony, your dad. - Are we going, or...? - Yeah.

They are hard to spot because they look just like us, but they're not us. They are nasty. Don't be scared. I'm here to save you. I know what I needed to tell you. Say it with me, "cannibalism."

I wish they'd give me one of them. I don't have a place at the moment, another attractive quality. You look amazing. - Do you remember my band? - No. Yeah, we were quite shit, but... I had this plan to release a killer album and then die young, remain credible, but it's a... Anyway, I got the band back together about a year ago and... I'm doing a gig soon if you wanna come. Well, you could say I'm a... Well, I'm like a rock star now. Very inspirated by Nirvana, for example. The Truth. Very much inspirated by The Truth. You know... What time's your gig? This is for Jane. So? What'd you think? Well done. Very good. Don't drink the water Unless you want your life Well, what was your favorite bits? Well... The singing. We're the Truth Detectives And detecting truth is what we do And when you're least expecting us You better look out 'cause We'll be inspecting you You all right? So I've been thinking, maybe you're not ill. Maybe you're an experiment. Maybe we're all an experiment for something else, that what's going on. I'm not ill anymore. I'm fine. Yeah. Well, it's... It's the world that's sick, innit? The world is... You know? And we're all being controlled. Or even controlled into thinking that we're not controlled. The queen's a shape-shifter You think she's weak and feeble But she's got the strength of a weightlifter She's got the beak of a seagull They control everything. They control what we eat, what we watch. It's the same mind-numbing fucking shit. Amusing little plays. Me and the Detectives, we don't stand a fucking chance. Death, death No breath Same false advertisement for how wonderful the world is while they're keeping a needle in the population behind closed doors. And everything we're taught is a fictitious lie. I can't... I'm sorry. I can't believe you've seen me perform. - I feel like I should see you perform. - I don't sing. Yeah, I know, but it's like... Because you've seen, like, the deepest, darkest part of me, which is the truth, because I'm at my most exposed when I'm, well, serenading. I bet you could sing. I bet you could sing like a fucking bird. You could be in the band. I don't sing. First, I was afraid, I was terrified Thinking I could never live Without you by my side But I've been so many long Thinking how you did me wrong But now you're back From outer space I didn't bump into anyone... Oh, that was fucking beautiful. I don't sing. - Jane? - Yeah. I'm going to act on a feeling now, and I want you to tell me whether or not you agree. I agree. Oh, my... Jane, oh, Jane, you're my kind of cocaine You're my little chicken Little chicken jail mate You're my muse. Lovely. I think I love you. I definitely love you. Just keeps the kidneys strong. - You'll feel much better. - I was thinking of... Right. I've got an announcement to make, so everyone, shut the fuck up! I'm dying. That's a lie. I'm getting married. We're getting married. Of course you are. - What's that supposed to mean? - What's your name? - Lesley. - Lesley? Nice. - It means I'm happy for you. - Good, because Lesley's ecstatic. I'm in my oils. Never been happier. So, Mike, have you got a job? Negative. No. So how do you make money? Well, I used to work in a bread factory, making bread, but now, technically, I gig, but that's art, and I don't consider art as a job. But you get paid? Again, technically... - He's so good. - Shut up. I'll tell you what, Lesley, the old bag of nuts surprised me. They should know. Maybe I should...? They... They should know. Jane is going to be the second lead vocalist in my band. Why? Because she's fucking good. Sorry about the dirty word. Mike, he reckons I've got what it takes. Like Celine Dion. Better. Better. Mike reckons I'm better than Celine Dion. I mean, this could really take off, you know, especially with what she's got, and it's like a new angle. We could be looking at the next, I don't know, Dory Previn. - What do you mean "with what she's got"? - Talent. Talent. With her talent. I'm really going for it. Right. Well, let's make a toast. Never seen us all so happy. Tell them. To me, because I'm getting married. And to happiness. - And to Mike moving in with me. - Yes! - What? - Yeah. That's quick. Yeah, well, we like each other, so... That doesn't mean you have to move in with each other. - There's nothing wrong with it. - Oh, yeah, I'm just checking. Because it's a big thing to move in with someone, so I'm just checking. I wanna do what I want. You let me do what I want. I want Mike to move in with me. Treat me like a child. Becoming like Mom. There's something else. Jane... will you marry me? Where's the ring? Yes. Congratulations. No. Sorry, Mike... I just don't think this is a good idea. - What? - I just don't. Why can't you be happy for me? - I am. - No, you're not. - We're leaving. - No. Jane, sorry. I... You're just jealous because I've got someone that actually pays attention to me. He's cheating on you, and you can't even see it! Tell her. Go on, tell her, Tony. - Tell her the truth. Go on. - You need to start taking your medication. And you need to fuck right off. Not one of my kids has visited me. What does that say? That... Do they know I'm ill? Yeah, yeah. Alice doesn't believe you. Would you mind if I talk to my daughter alone? No. No. No, Mom, you... It's fine. You can say what you like in front of Mike. He's not gonna go. He's not... He's not gonna... go spreading stuff. He... - I'm not a snitch. - He's not a snitch. I'm very loyal. You're not marrying this fool. You can preach all you like to me, it's not happening. Why? Why? Give me your hand. - No, I'm not... - Shut up! - I don't want... - Give me your hand. - No, don't... Don't... - No... It's all right. I'm comfortable facing whatever's ahead of me. You don't know what she's gonna do. There's a devil inside you. Stay away from her, you fuckhead! Mom, stop it. We're put on this earth with a purpose. Do you want to know what your purpose is? No. You need to wake up. I'll wake up when I want to. I'll pay you back when the band get a deal. When do you think that will be? Soon? Any day now. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Jane? Jane. - What's wrong? - He's gone. Where is he? It's Lesley. He's dead. He's gone. He went peacefully. Did he? No, it's fine. We were married, so I'll be fine. Jane. Nicola? I think I'm like you. I keep hearing voices in the walls, and they won't go away. Can I stay with you till I get Lesley's money? How long do you think that will be, then? Probably a while. - Nicola. - Yeah? How long is "a while"? Do you ever wake up and think, "Something's not right"? You look older. Then you need Eternal Beauty. It's working. Taking you from faceless to flawless. Let's have one of those. - No. - Come on, I've got what you've got. They're mine. You can't. Anyway, I take...

Well, there's no such thing as happiness. Only moments of not being depressed. Where did you read that? Come on, repeat after me. I am in my oils. No. Say it. You say it. Take some classy photos of me. It's important people remember this, okay? Okay. How do I look? Nice. Nice, or... really nice? Really nice. Thank you. Some people say I'm "paranoid schizophrenic," which means I think you're out to kill me, as opposed to schizophrenic, where I'd be out to kill you. I'm not gonna kill you, though. Fine. How about you? I'm normal. Okay. That's boring.
