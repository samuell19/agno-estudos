Heavy, isn't it? Give me a piece. Delicious, isn't it? It's cooked in the Georgian way. I love it. Just a little bit. Give me a drink. What's the matter? Are you in pain? My stomach. It's my wound here. I got wounded. The bullet is still in there. The doctor told me to exercise. To do this... and l'll be OK. Can you hear? Look at them! Can you see it? Give it to me.

Two handkerchiefs? - Is that all? - Stop asking questions. - Why only two handkerchiefs? - I don't know. It's order number 248. Obey, or do it yourself. What manners! I work all day long. You can't do that to us. - Keep quiet. - Brother, l'm wounded. A soldier must obey orders. - But since l'm wounded... - Undress. I'm also wounded. Shall I cover myself with this? Do that, the rest doesn't matter. Where are you going? Go over there. You can only go there dressed. Come on. Get undressed. Nothing else works... ...only disinfectant. Are you a girl or a soldier? What are you doing? Close it. They're not ready, and the machine needs to cool down. Hurry up, boys! Look at those soldiers! They make you strip! Look! Napoleon! Is it ready? Patience, soldier! Hold on! Open it! You've ruined my uniform. Don't be fussy. Here... Let's go. Nice work. - Enough, soldier. - Yes, indeed. - Stop squealing! - You've ruined my uniform... - What's the matter? - It hurts. Something's hurting me... inside. Look... my tongue. Good. The Germans got me. The devil knows how, but I survived. And l'm OK, do you understand? The doctor said I need a good diet and exercise. Don't worry, l'll survive. Water, hot water. Come on, quickly. They are waiting for the milk. Kolya is ill. What are you saying? Hurry up! We've got a lot of wounded. Don't you understand? Kolya is ill. He didn't understand a word. - l've got documents. - I see. Go home. - l've got documents. - l'm Hungarian. Is there a doctor amongst you? No. Do you want some meat? Thank you. - Do you live here? - I do. - Is he ill? - He is. He got wounded, and now he's ill. - Is he Russian? - He is. What are you waiting for? Why don't you get lost? Some more meat? No, thanks. Let's go! Stop! Stop! Don't drink this. You're ill. - We have documents. - Go. Go. Hello, Comrade. Where are you heading? I've been near VoroneZh for two years. I worked there in a factory, you know. - I worked... - Go. Halt. Move on. Halt! We have documents. Step back. Turn away. He's alone. That's unusual. Don't show you're afraid. A doctor? Is there a doctor here? Doctor, yes? Come on. He's alone. Take his weapon. Be careful. He's loaded it. Let's go! - Let's go. - Don't let him do it! Stay calm. Probably someone is ill here. Move! Move, move! Move it! Wait here. Go back. Go! Go! Be careful by the tracks! I baked cakes for them, and meat, too. They were so nice, they didn't hurt us. I made strudel for them. They said, "Mama, let it be good!" I said, "You'll gobble it up!" Tovarish! There is room here! Come and sit down! Sit down. - Thank you. - You're Hungarian? - Yes. - In this uniform? I thought you were Russian. Here. Eat. So you are Hungarian? Well, well... We've already met, haven't we? I want to tell you something. Come! Take his gun. Look! Look! The scoundrels! Don't let them get you!
