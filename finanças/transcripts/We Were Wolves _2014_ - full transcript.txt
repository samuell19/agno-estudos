- There you go! - Why can't we come? - Hey, how you feeling? - I want to die. -: Hey, Mom! -: Dad? Dad, I'm talking to you! - One second! Where'd you guys go? - Oh, some club with a bunch of big, young idiots trying to bag themselves a cougar! - We hardly went this summer! - I know, but you wouldn't like it now. The lake's too cold. You want pancakes? - Hmm! Mm-mmm! - Are you bringing Grandpa? - Who wants the last one? I've got enough for one more! - Me! - Yeah, you? - Yeah! - Oh, sorry! She beat you, bud! - All set? - Yeah, almost. - If you waited a few weeks, I could take some time off. We could all go together. - I gotta close it up before the frost comes. Get the boat out of the water. - There's 2 different plastic ones. - It goes to the same place. - And the bigger one. You danced with young guys last night? - I didn't fuck anybody, Nick. That all ended when we got married. - We should go dancing. - You don't dance. - What do you need? - I got it. - Jesus, Jenny, let me-- - I got it! I'm just-- - I got it! I got it! Jenny-- - I got it! - For fuck's sake! Jesus! Fuck! - OK, sorry! - I got it! I got it! - I'm just trying to help! - I got it!- Fuck! I'm sorry! It's just a tough time. - I know. Mmm! : Nick! - Come on, we've got time. In the fucking garage? God, look at you. Sometimes, I don't even recognize that skinny face of yours. Call me when you get there! - All right! - Oh, Nick Blake! - How are you, Les? - Up for the weekend? - Hey, there's a car parked in our spot. Any idea who that is? - Here when I got in this morning. Must've showed up in the middle of the night. - Thanks! Oh, Jesus! Fuck! - Snickers! Oh my God! Look at you! You took that health kick to the next level! I gotta say, though, I'm gonna miss those tits. Those were some great tits! - Ah, get off me! - Oh, relax! Just saying you did good. I'm proud of you! Although, I do deserve some of the credit for calling you a fat turd all those years. I gave you the drive you needed to be chisel led and gay! - What are you doing here, Danny? - What do you mean? I came to see you! - Good! You bring the money you owe me? - Ah, man! Dad left you the Buick. Snickers, you lucky fucker! How's she running? - How'd you know where I was? - Mom told me you were coming out. I figured you could use a hand. Oh man! I must've taken about 5 wrong turns on the way out. : Can't believe they changed all the highways around! - They didn't. - Hey! Is Les still running the store? He must be like 100-and-fucking-8 by now! - Ah, come on, Nicky! I drove all night to see you. You're not happy to see me? - All right, I fucking screwed up, OK? Snickers, mea fucking culpa! - Stop fucking calling me that, all right? - OK! Trust me, Nicky. I wouldn't have been any use to you. - Yeah, well, as always, I took care of it. - See? Exactly! You've always been better at that stuff than me, ever since you were a chubby, little-- I didn't mean it! Ah! Look, I'm here now to help, OK? Come on, man! It's like the old Blake boys back together again! OK, well, for once. The Blake boys back together for once. Having all the good times that we fucking should've had, OK? Now, what do you say? Here! - Oh shit! - Jesus, is that-- - See, Danny, this is exactly why I didn't call you. You're about as helpful as a fucking hurricane. - Fuck, I'm sorry, Nicky! - Look, just go, OK? I don't want you here. - Fine. - What's that? - It's for Mika. His birthday's Tuesday, right? - Yeah. - OK, well, it's not much. The fucking card blew out the window when I was smoking a J on the way up, but I don't know, I think he'll like it. : Thanks! - All right, see you around, Nicky. Hey, is the gas station up the road or down the fucking road? - Start the boat. : Oh! We're gonna have so much fun, Snickers! - Drain it first! - I will! I will! Oh, and get some chips and smokes and beer and worms! Oh! And shit tickets! Last time I was here, I wiped with poison oak. I'm really glad we're doing this, Snickers! ♪♪ It's a pleasure... Hey, Snickers! Remember how Dad used to put you up in the bow when you were a little kid, way down in the boat, 'cause you were such a tub? ♪ Over my shoulders Hey, Snickers! - "Do you remember--" What? Jesus, Nick! We almost went over. It's not funny! ♪ Tied to a boat ♪ Bigger than me ♪ Whoa! It's not as big as I remember. - Hey! : Oh! Danny with the save! Jesus! The thing's all rotted! - Yeah, he never got around to that. - Fucking shocker. The place still has that aroma to it: shit and tobacco, the smell of Dad. - Hey, I only brought food for one. - That's all right. I don't eat much. I'll just lay off the weed. Oh! Dibs on the bird cage! - That's fine by me. - I gotta hand it you, man. He's not as hoarder-y as I was expecting. - Ah, I've been working hard at it. It's my third trip up. - Yeah, you always, uh... You always had that feminine touch, didn't you, Snickers? How is the lovely Jenny, by the way? - Jennifer is good. She's happy to be back at work - Oh, right! You guys had a second kid, didn't you? - Yes, Carrie. She's 5. - That's a hard age, 5, always being yelled at. Man, I can't believe that you actually fucking managed to bag Jenny "Wild Child" Warwick - Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't fucking do that in here. - Dad smokes in here all the time. - He quit 4 years ago when I did. - Well, leave all this shit. Let's go cast a few. Come on! - No, I'm gonna call Jen. I'm gonna get to work. : Oh my God! Did you ask him where he's been? - He's down at some shithole bar, I'd assume. - Wow, is he OK? - Is he OK? - Well, it must've taken him a lot to come there. - Jesus, Jenny! Why do you always stick up for him? - Nick, he's reaching out. Give him a chance. - Oh my fucking God! Holy shit! : Now, there's a capital idea! - You OK to put your worm on your hook, or you want me to get a little girl do it for you? : Oh, going after the older brother with a burn! I appreciate the effort, Snickers! Your kids fish? - Mika does. Carrie just likes the worms. - I bet they have some fun up here. - Yeah! He was begging to come out this morning. - What? You should've let him come up! I would've loved to see him! - Well, he's got this thing called school. You're that kind of dad! - Let's go over by the docks. The weeds here are too high. - Yeah, well, you don't need to move... Oh! ...if you know how to cast. Does Dad have a will? - OK! - Look, I'm not trying to be insensitive. I'm out of the loop! - Why do you think that is? - Will you go easy? I'm just asking you a question. - Of course, he had a will. - And? - And? - Did it just say "pull my finger," or was there something to it, Snickers? - I went through it 2 months ago with the lawyer. : And? - And you were nowhere to be found. - Well, you know what, I was on the road touring. - That's supposed to be an excuse? - No, it's supposed to be my fucking job. - A job pays you money. - Fuck this! I knew this was a mistake. See you around, fucker! - Look... Everything he had left was on this island. - Thank you! So, what's gonna happen to the cottage? - Well, I've got kids and a wife. - Yeah. - I live close by. But he left it to both of us. - The property must be worth some lot of money! - Oh, for fuck's sake! I'm fishing off the dock. - OK, Snickers, pl e-- Hey, Nick! Look, will you just stay and fish with me, please? I'm sorry! : Just at least until I get a bit before you, OK? - Not a chance! You should've seen the perch I was catching up here in the-- - Oh, got one! You see, Snickers, what you need to do is imagine that the fish are made out of peanuts and chewy nougat and salty caramel. We're gonna eat good tonight, Mr. I Only Brought Food for One! - Oh fuck! Lucky that didn't pull you in! - Go fuck yourself! It's gonna be delicious! - Mmm, no, I'm trying not to drink beer. Gluten. - Ah, fuck! Sorry, man. - Actually, you know what? Fuck it! It's OK. - Yeah! - Cheers! - Cheers! To blow jobs and anal in heaven. What are we looking for again? - Just toss the junk. Set any personal stuff of Dad's aside that you think we should keep. - He kept Mom's sketchbook. - Yeah, he kept everything. - Can I have it? - Sure! They spoke a few months ago, you know? - Yeah, I heard. He could barely string a sentence together. - It wasn't the booze. He went off his meds. - Oh yeah? His booze meds? - He was a good man in the end, Danny. Even Mom chose to forgive him. - No, she chose to forget a lot of things. My memory's just a little bit less selective. - He asked about you all the time. - Oh, if I was dead yet? - No, if you were in the city, playing music, doing well. - Well, I am, actually. I'm doing awesome! I'm about to record a new album. Some people think it could be the one. - Mom told me all about it. - She's my biggest fan. What? - Nothing. You two make a cute couple is all. Oh, hey, he, uh... He wanted you to have that. - Yeah, you can give it to Mika. - You sure you wanna sleep out here? - I lost my virginity twice in this little place here, Snickers. Good times all around, buddy. - Well, suit yourself. - Oh! Oh my God! Oh my-- This is freaking bullshit! : Fuck! - Oh, did the palace of the lost virginity lose its heat? - Oh fuck! Eat a cock, Snickers! How the fuck do we shower? - You don't remember? - Mmm, fuck! Jesus! - Whoo! Come on in, big brother! The water's fine. No, I forgot my chest wax. Crikey! Just look at this mother orangutan! She's really pregnant! Just look at her labia! Look how swollen they are. She's not gonna give birth for days. She's not gonna give birth in hours. She'll give birth in seconds. ♪♪ I woke today at sundown ♪ And the first thing through my head ♪ ♪ Is the twilight all around me ♪ ♪ Another day begins ♪ It would be lying not to tell you ♪ Hmm!

You're Jack's eldest, Danny. - Oh, oh, oh! Sorry, sorry! There! - Let me guess. You knew my father. - Yeah!- Mm-h mm! - You got any more pot? - You a cop? Am I a cop? No! You reek, jackass! Fork it over! - OK! I brought my own lighter and everything! Ooh! Merci beau coup! The name's Kathleen Harrington, by the way. - Harrington, as in Vic Harrington from across the lake? - I'm his second wife. - I didn't know he remarried. - Redivorced too. : Oh, I'm real fucking sorry to hear that. - Don't be. You're sitting on my settlement. Oh... - Do you know Nick? - Uh, just from a distance. Pretty wife, 2 kids. - Yeah! - Never seen you around here, though. - Yeah, I'm not much of the outdoorsy type. : Yeah! Oh, that's right! You're a big-city musician! Jack told me. - Did he now? What else did he tell you? Any expletives, any put-downs? - Are we talking about the same guy here? - I thought we were. - When was the last time you saw him? - I don't know. Nick's wedding, maybe. Oh, unless you count yesterday morning when I almost dropped his ashes off the fucking wharf. - Oh God! - So, what are you doing out here all alone? - I like the quiet. - Mm-h mm! Nice place to bring a young fellow for a romantic getaway. No one can hear the cries of pleasure. - You really are your father's son, aren't you? - Hmm! Them's fight in' words... ...miss y. - Ooh! This is such good weed. - Mm-h mm!- Holy crap! - Yup! Don't let me stop you, champ! - Where have you been? - We have company coming for dinner. - Who? - Kathleen, friend of Dad's. Old as fuck, man, but she's hot as balls. - Yeah, I know who she is. She screwed Vic over when they split. - She's bringing steak! - I have steak. - Oh, hey! I found moon meadow on my walk. A few trees down, but I recognized it. : Almost got down on all fours for old-time's sake. You really wanna keep this place, man? God, it's fucking ghosts everywhere, you know? - You say you're here to help. We barely put a dent in this. - Oh God! OK! Loosen up your fucking tampons! I'm just talking out loud. - There's more boxes upstairs. - Where's the light? - Same place it always was. - OK, all right! Fuck! - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fucking fine. Oh fuck! - Oh, Daddy's brushing his teeth. Are you brushing yours? Hmm? OK, there! -: Read me a story! - No, Mommy's gonna read you a story. - I miss you, Daddy. - I miss you too. Good night, sweetheart! : Hi! - I dread the day she's too old for that. - Start dreading. How's it going up there? Killed each other yet? - Well, there's always tomorrow. -: I love you. - I love you too. - Love you, Jenny baby! Aw! Wow, it smells good in here, man! - It's just boiling water. - Hmm! - Nice shirt. - Thank you! Is it new? - I haven't worn it yet, if that's what you mean. - Nah, it looks better on a man, anyways. Speaking of men... I know we never got Dad to do the real official blood test, but I'm pretty sure we're related, so it's just not gonna happen. - Give me those. - Here, take them. Oh! Sorry! Oh! I don't know what's happening. Why does it always do that? Strange! - Fuck off! Just give me them! Jesus! : Oh! - They're just in my bag from a trip to Niagara with Jen, all right? - You have to wrap it up with your fucking wife? What is the point of being married? - Look, 2 kids is enough for right now. - Yeah! You always wanted kids, didn't you? Fuck, I admire that about you. I always figured I'd fuck mine up. - Kids are pretty resilient. - Mm-h mm. Well, too bad condoms aren't. - Oh! Party time! - Hey! - Hi! I've always been jealous of your view. Danny's in the kitchen. - OK! - Oh, thank you! Is this Jack? - Yeah. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry! I haven't looked yet. Oh! Oh, well, he always did love boxes! : "And all the shit you could put in them." - So, pothead! Oh! Oh my God! Hi! Hey! How's the elbow? - Oh, wacked off 3 times. Right as rain! Oh, look at this! - Ah!- L'chaim! - L'chaim! I didn't have any mix, but there's usually tonic water here, so... - Is there? - Well, let's get marinating, huh? Hey, Snickers, why don't you try to put on a fire, OK? All right! : Will you chill the fuck out? Jesus! There was never any contest, see? I mean, look at Charlie. You'd never think Dad would be able to out drink him. Yeah, thank you! 'Cause Charlie had about fuckin' 25, 30 pounds on Dad. Dad was all muscle. See, I don't know if you noticed, Nicky, but Dad was a real sinewy fucker back in the day. I mean, if he hit you, it left a welt. That's for sure! There you go! - Thank you! - That, besides the fact that he never stopped pounding the booze, meant he could hold it better. - Charlie's his older brother, so there's no fucking way he's backing down, so he keeps pointing at his glass as he says... : "Fill it up! You fill up my fucking glass!" : Booze is, like, pouring down the fucking front of his shirt. He's a fucking disgrace, but Dad, I mean, Dad's just sitting there, back straight, he's as cool as a fucking cucumber. - Oh my God! Where was your poor mother? - Uh, Mom! Yeah, uh, I don't know where Mom was. Probably asleep or something. - Anyways, I was spying on them from the bird cage, and uh... - No, I'm fine. - Will you just take the fucking drink? So they're about this deep into the bottle of Ballantine's, right, and Charlie just starts slumping back in his chair, right? And he's swaying this way, and he's swaying that way, and Dad's given him all kinds of outs, right, but Charlie won't fucking hear it, "Fine, fuck it!" "You know what? "Double or nothing, rest of the bottle, 2 drinks." So Dad takes the rest of the booze, pours it out right up to the fucking brims, right? I mean, at this point, Charlie's barely holding it together. The glass was like a fucking cannonball in his hand, right? But Dad, I mean, Dad is just-- Right before he drinks, he looks and he sees me spying on him... - Oh! - And he just finds me, and he just fucking winks. Knocks her back all in one gulp like there was fucking nothing to it. But Charlie fucking-- Charlie has one sip, falls out of his fucking chair, hits the ground, fucking, like, out unconscious, didn't wake up for a fucking day and a half. : Oh no! : Fuck, Aunt Carol was losing her mind! Couldn't find him. No phone up here then, right, so probably thought he was fucking dead. Hmm... Charlie, yeah, he probably wished he was fucking dead. They bet the family cottage that night. After that, it was Dad's. - Wow! How old were you then? - Hmm, Jesus! I don't know. 6, 7? Nicky was just a baby. Don't remember that, do you, Nicky? The glory days, back before Dad started being a parent, 'cause he finally had something worth living for. - What do you mean? : Oh, Nicky over there was Dad's pride and joy. - I'm gonna get these going. - Holy fuck! We haven't eaten yet! - No, we have not! And I'm starting to feel this too. : Cheers! - Oh God! Hey! Hi! - Hey! Thanks! - Uh, no, thanks! That was his brand. Dad hated that story. Him and Charlie weren't the same after that. - Why didn't they just call it off? - Too proud? A deal's a deal. You been up here for long? - Oh, it gets a little longer each year. - Dad never mentioned you. - Well, maybe he had a few secrets. I mean, he spoke about you all the time. - All good, I hope. - Well, he told me about how you took care of him when your mom left. That must've been hard for a kid. - Yeah! I did what anyone would do. A shame your family couldn't come up. - Yeah, Jen's got work, kids have school. - How old are they now? - 12 and 5. - 12! Oh my God! You're kidding! You must be older than you look. - Nope! You guys thinking of selling? - Did Danny say that? - Oh, no! No, I just saw a bunch of boxes in the kitchen. - Those are for Dad's stuff. Make sure it doesn't get ruined. - Why? - Out of respect. Gee, he knew it was junk! I mean, if he couldn't let go of it, I'm sure he'd be happy if-- - Listen, not to be rude, but why is there tonic here? You know he's been sober for 12 years. - Yeah! Jack never drank. He kept it just for me. - He stopped taking his pills. Did he do that for you too? Sorry! I don't know you. You don't know me. Let's just-- We'll leave it there. - Fine by me. Now, what the fuck is that? Aha! The hunters have returned with their spoils! Ah-ah-ah! Not so fast. Come here. To new friends and the elusive son of a bitch that brought us all together. Down the hatch! - Could I have a drag of that? - Uh, yeah, of course. Thank you! - Good barbecuing, guys? - Mmm! - All right! Time to eat. - Ooh! : Oh! - Yeah, I mean, I don't even remember exactly how it fucking started. I mean, to tell you the truth-- Do you, Snickers? And there was this one night when Dad was shitfaced, so we snuck out to the meadow. : I think I stole one of his beers before. I mean, I had some balls on me, that's for sure. Anyways, we got to the meadow, and the moon was just insanely bright. You know, it was all full and fat, and it was lighting up everything, I mean, every leaf on the ground, every leaf on every tree, like every fucking pine needle, right? And Nicky just starts stripping down, all 350 pounds of him. I mean, he couldn't have been more than 5 or 6. Anyways, halfway up that fucking board right there-- See that molding? Look at that. - Yeah! And he's just down there, he's on the ground, he's barking, he's growling, and he's howling like this little feral wolf douche... He's having such a good time that I just.. I just joined in. So there we were. It was the dead of night, and we're naked... and we're down on all fours, and we're just howling up at the sky. You know, we were kids. It was perfect. - Hmm! Wow! It sounds so... It's, like, cathartic. - Hmm! Yeah, no, it sounds gay! But, yeah, that was something there. - It's beautiful. It is. It's really beautiful. I wish that I had, like, memories like that from my family. - Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, I guess, you know, we did have those-- Fuck, we had a few good moments, man! You know, Snickers? We missed all that shit, right? - You and I remember our childhoods a little differently. - Hmm, yeah. Mine was shit and yours wasn't. Yeah, I get it. - Oh gosh! Oh, I love this!

In-between drinks. Oh my God! : You're fucking smoking Dad's brand? - Hey, come on! How come you guys didn't see each other for so long? - Ah, well, you know, it's the age-old story, really. Nicky went off to be an astronaut, and I went to a monastery to find myself. Oh, bullshit! - Have you not heard a word I've said? I'm a fucking man of God! Clearly! - Danny left home the minute he turned 18. I barely saw him again. - Oh, OK! That's how it went down. - When I was younger, all I wanted to do was live in the city with Danny, play in his band, sleep with lots of girls... - So why didn't you? - He never asked me. - Hold the fuckin' phone! No, no, no! You fuckin' visited me once. - I didn't. - Yeah, you did. - I was playing at Rocky's, and you came to see my set. - Hmm, I don't remember that. - Oh, I remember that. I had to lie to get you in, and I bought you fucking beer all night, and you hung out with my band all night. Ah, it was wicked. Don't fucking lie to me. - What? Oh my God! He-- And you told that crazy fucking story of walking in on Dad trying to jerk off, but he couldn't, so he's fucking crying. Oh my God! My buddies thought you were fucking hilarious! Ah man! You were crazy. That was a great fucking night. Fuck it! If we're gonna salute him... - Mm-h mm! - ...then we will do it right. Danny, you have it wrong. - What? - You are wrong. - Uh, yeah, big fucking surprise, but-- - WRONG! - Wrong, OK! But what about, Snickers? Fuck! - He did not drink Uncle Charlie under the table. - Oh, fuck off! - He had a bowl of ice under the table on a chair, and he would put more ice in his glass than Charlie's, and he would wait for that ice to melt, and then he would drink. And he would drink more water, and Charlie would drink more booze with every drink. - What? - That's how our dad out drank Charlie, by being smart. - He fucking cheated! - Nope! No! He outsmarted him. That's why our dad hated this story. Because he outsmarted his brother... out of all this. Tortured his entire fucking life. - Nick? - Leave me alone! - Just come here and talk to me, OK? - Ow! Fuck! Ow! - What happened? - Nothing! I'm fine. Call out, so I can find you. - No, I'm fine! - Just call out! - N-- Here! - Again? - Here! - Again! - Here! - Again? - Here. Here. Ow! What was that? - A horrible, horrible burden. Will you excuse me? - Yeah, of course! : Oh God! - Hello, there! - Not going for the easy choice. - Why would you assume any choice would be easy? - So, what is this? You miss my dad? - People my age miss a lot of people. You look just like him, you know that? - You were always such a scary, fucking prick... but a prick nonetheless who just happened to be my father. So, fuck you once. And fuck you twice. You look great! - Why did you let me drink so much? - We have the same blood in our veins, baby brother. Mmm! You need some greasy breakfast. Ah, man! You would've been a lightweight during the glory days. Dad coming home, piss drunk, passed out on the couch, if I was lucky. There's the time when he mistaked the record player for a toilet. Up goes the lid, out comes the piss. Then, of course, there's all the times he would pitch our shit out into the lake: my bike, canned goods, photo albums... - Is that a Caesar? - Uh, yeah. Hair of the dog. - When did you get the tomato juice? - I watered down a can of sauce. Do you want one? - Mm-mmm. : No? Mmm! Oh, listen, Jenny called earlier. Mom, it's Dad! Hi! So, your mom called. - Yeah, what'd she want? - Besides the chance to judge my parenting skills, she just was checking up on you too. Wanted to make sure Danny gave you the gift she bought for Mika's birthday. - Yeah. Yeah, I got it. - Oh, and, OK, don't be mad, but I let the bunny out of the cage to run around, and he chewed through some cables. - Jesus, Jenny! - It's OK! I will get my brother to fix it. - No! Don't, don't, don't! I'll fix it when I'm back. - Everything OK out there? - Yeah, yeah! Uh, we could use another day, though. - Stay--stay as long as you need. I gotta go. - OK! Hey! : Oh! I thought we were out! - You hid a few in the toilet tank. : So I did! Thanks for that one, Pop! - You got a light? - Yup! - It's all weeds out there. You gotta cast more over by the dock. - Uh-huh. - You won't catch anything there, Danny. Fine! If you fish there, you can catch me another minnow. - For fuck's sakes! Sometimes, you're just like him, with the fucking criticism. I'm on my vacation. You're stressing me right the fuck out! - It's not a fucking vacation. - It doesn't feel like one now. - Hey, Mom called Jen, by the way. Wanted to know if I got that birthday gift she sent for Mika. - Oh fuck! Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I left that in the trunk. - You know, she wasn't a saint, either. - What the fuck are you talking about? - Mom. You're always telling stories about Dad, but she fucked up too. - I'm sure he told you lots of bullshit to defend himself. - She had an affair. Did you know that? - Why would I know that? - It's one of the reasons he quit drinking. - So fucking his kids up wasn't reason enough? - Dad didn't fuck me up. You did. She did. - What is that supposed to mean? - Maybe they could've fixed things if she hadn't fucked around. - That ship was sinking from the first toast at their wedding. - She was the unfaithful one. - Fuck you! She was a saint. - You never knew her, Danny. You just made her what you needed her to be. You used her to prove Dad wrong. But it's OK! You used her, she used you. Then things got tough, you took off, and she started fucking every guy with guitar and-- - Shut your fucking mouth! Don't you say a word about her! She's the only reason I didn't pack it in fucking years go! - Come on, hit me, hit me. - What the fuck? - Come on! - What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck? Oh my God! You fucked her! You fucked her! - What? - You fucked her? Holy fuck, that's what this is about! - No.- Holy shit! Oh my God! Nicky, listen, I know you're feeling like this is the end of the world, but it's really not. If you're thinking about coming clean, think again. Do not do it. It's never worth it. Just chalk it up to the booze and Dad and me. And the first one's free, right? - No. - In a couple days, it'll be fine! - No. - It will. You don't wanna fuck things up with Jenny. She's already borderline way too good for you. - No, I mean, it's not the first time. - What? Who? - What does it matter? - It doesn't. Just fucking why, man? - You're asking me that? You? Like you've never fucking cheated? - Of course I have, man. Tons of times. That's why I never got married, though. I never dreamed you-- Is it, like, a woman from work or something? - No. - It was a woman, though, right? - FUCK! - OK. - Fuck off! - Look, I'm sorry, man. I'm just fucking trying to help here! - No one, OK? They're just... They're just girls. A girl I met on line. A waitress. - Sorry, Nicky. I just-- Fuck, I never pegged you for the type, man. Hold on a second. Were you bringing one here? Holy fuck! Did you order a hooker? - A hooker? Fuck you! - That's why you never wanted me here! Holy fuck! Oh my God! And the fucking pills! And the condoms and that fucking shirt! I cock-blocked your ecstasy fuck-weekend, didn't I? Oh my God! Holy! What the fuck, Nicky? You're fucking married to Jenny, man! Jenny Warwick! I mean, why don't you just pop a few pills with her and have a fucking great time? She got into some scandalous shit when she was younger. - Yeah, well, not anymore. Not with me. - OK, well, you're having a dry spell, man. - Don't give me fucking marital advice, Danny! Jesus! - Trust me, man, I'm not giving anyone marital advice. I'm not judging you. Hey! It's just... I don't know, man. You know, maybe this is a sign. - What do you mean, a sign? - Well, maybe someone's trying to tell us something, you know? I mean, this isn't just ghosts anymore, Nicky. This is fucking real, tangible bad shit her. This place is cursed! - No, you're fucking with me. - Come on, now! You got your reasons. I got mine too. Let's be rid of it. Let's sell this fucking place. - I can't. My kids love it here. - Well, take the money. Take your half of the money and go buy 'em something new. You know, give them the memories that they... that we wanted, you know, before all the fucking baggage. You're a fucking great guy, man! And your whole life, you try to be stuff that you think other people need you to be, and you don't even fucking know who you are! Of course you fucking strayed. Jenny, Jesus, man! It's not like she's a saint. Maybe she never technically cheated on you, but she probably fucking did. - For fuck's sake! - OK! - Jesus! - All I'm saying is it's over, right? Yeah? So, you tasted the other fruit. You know, you tasted the other much older forbidden fruit. Sorry! - I took care of Dad. I took care of Jen. I did everything I was supposed to do. - I know, man. And I should've been there for you, and I wasn't, and I'm fucking sorry. Man, did you really want Jenny coming down here with a morning coffee, looking out over this lake and seeing that woman you fucked, everyday? Come on! You want Kathleen down here teaching young Carrie how to put her fucking makeup on? - You leave my kids out of this! - Jesus, fuck! I'm just trying to help! Will you stop doing that? - Sorry. Sorry. Ah, I'm such a fuck-up! - Yeah, well... join the fucking club, man. You're a Blake. This place, Nicky, this is... This is tainted. Just like it was when Dad stole it from fucking Uncle Charlie. It's time to bury the cross, little brother. Say adios. - All right, fuck! Come here, Nicky. Come here. It's gonna be OK. You got it?- Yeah. - All right. Jesus! What? Don't worry about it! Should've brought the beer down. - Could you pass me those bolts? - Yeah.- Thanks. Oh-ho-ho! - I'm not picking them up, you fucker. - You dropped them. - I can drop you in a second. Who the fuck is that? Jesus, fucking... - Hi! Daniel, right? - What the fuck are you doing here? We said 3:00. - Yeah, fucking next week, man! - Hey! Who are you? - Paul Garrety, Action Real Estate. I'm here for the appraisal. - What appraisal? - Oh, it's a few items I knew you wouldn't mind I sold. Right? A couple odds and ends. - The cottage and surrounding property as we discussed. - Oh, fuck you! - OK, Nick. Nick! Snickers! - Don't call me Snickers! - Look, I'm sorry! I was gonna say something! - That's why you're here? To sell? You saw the opportunity and you went right for it! - It's not fucking like that, OK? Look, everything this weekend, it was all real. It was like the best weekend ever for me. - Fellas! Sorry, can I interrupt? I know now might not seem like the best time, but I've dealt with many family estates, many in conflict, and it's an emotional time. It's charged, absolutely. But it's my job, OK? I'm here to help. I'm gonna make this as quick and painless as humanly possible. Whoa! Excuse me! - Do you know why this isn't the right time, Paul? Because you're a week fucking early! - I'm sorry! There's no need for violence! - One more word, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you as painfully as humanly possible! - You're insane, asshole! - Well, you're a fucking human! - You're one too. - How come I'm an asshole if he's a human? - You're both assholes! - Oh! I guess we really showed Paul, huh? - Don't fucking talk to me! - Come on, Nicky! Nick! Nick, would you just fucking hold on a second, man? Fuck! Nick, come on, man! Look... I'm fucking broke, Snickers! OK? I owe more than I've made in the last 3 fucking years, OK? Look, I'm not gonna blow it! I got this really good opportunity, Nicky! - Aw, you're full of shit! - I was at the folk festival at Dunne Lake last year. This big producer, he's a big deal, he saw me, and he thought I was really good. If I could get this one album done... - Then what? Then what? There'll be more of your records at garage sales and flea markets? - Yeah, there it is. Safe, old fucking Nick. You know, just go to work, come home to your perfect fucking wife and your perfect fucking kids, wail on those fucking pecks! Maybe I want more out of life! - How's that going for you? - Better than you! - Oh really? 'Cause I don't sleep in my fucking car! Look, I saw your shit in your back window. Your Gibson, your fucking record collection. Jesus Christ, Danny! You're still trying to be the bad boy. You know what the bad boy is when he's almost 40, huh? He's a fuck-up! He's a fucking waste! - Yeah, I sleep in my car! I slept with Jennifer too. - What did you just say? - Oh fuck! So, he didn't hear me. I fucked your gorgeous wife! - I'm not falling for your bullshit, Danny. - OK, 'cause she fucking did. Oh yeah! Hook, line and sinker, man. She was a freshman, I was a senior. Fuck, it was easy! You know what I loved about fucking her, man? When she's on top-- you know this-- and she's going down real fucking slow and coming up real fast like that with that high-pitched moan. Where do you think she picked that up, Snickers? Fucking Girl Guides? You're welcome! Yeah, I was her first! And her second and her third, and, fuck, I lost count after that. Oh, what the fuck do you care, Nicky? You've got Kathleen. You've got all those other nameless skanks! You're fucking knee-deep in pussy! Oh, but not Jenny's pussy. You know what? I might stop in on her on the way home. - OK, you fucking fuck-up! - Fucking Snickers! Still hits like a fat little fucking girl. - You don't even know what you did, huh? You left him with me. He couldn't dress himself. He couldn't wipe his own fucking ass! You left him with me! You and Mom fucking left him with me! Why did you do this, Danny? Why would you come back here and pretend to fucking like me? We're not brothers anymore. You don't have a niece or a nephew. I never wanna fucking see you again. - OK, OK! Nick, hey! Let go of me! Let go! Stop it! What's your problem? Hey! Nick, come back here! - OK! OK! Oh, Danny's not allowed to drive the fucking boat! No! He's not allowed! Fuck you, Snickers! What the fuck? Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck! I didn't drain the fucking engine! Oh fuck! : Oh my God! What do I do? Hey! Hey! Paul! Over here! It's Danny! Oh, come on! Where's your fucking humanity? -: Nick! - Fuck off! - You need to slow down. - Just leave me alone! - Nick! - He couldn't fuck you when he was on those pills? - Stop! - That's why he went off them? - Stop! - Was that worth it? - I didn't know. I--I wouldn't have let him if I knew. He was happy, OK? We both were happy. He knew what he was doing. It wouldn't have mattered what I said or what you did. I knew. I fucking knew! - Yeah, Jen was the first girl I ever kissed. I got her pregnant on our 3rd date. Now I just follow her around the house, picking up after her, sighing, throwing things on my back like I'm a martyr. It must drive her insane. - Maybe you should tell her that. - I don't know how. - Maybe you just don't think you deserve the things you really want. - I'm glad he had you. But I don't wanna end up like him. - You're not your father. You're Nick, you're brother's Danny. And your father was Jack. All fuck-ups in their own right. All good men. Maybe when you let him out of that box, you'll finally let yourselves out too. - Aw, fuck! - Let me guess! You didn't drain the engine. - Ha! Well, look who it is! Snickers in the fucking gloat boat! Where did you get that piece of shit? No, no, no! Please, please! I'm sorry! I'm fucking scared! Nick! Snickers! - Why'd you do it, Danny? - I fucking told you, OK. I'm broke. I haven't been to the dentist in 10 fucking years! My life's ridiculous. Are you happy? - Do I look happy? - I got a kid, man! - What? - He's 3. I didn't fucking know. Some girl I met on tour. - Jesus Christ! You expect me to believe that, Danny? - Aw, fuck you! You know what? Look! Huh? Do you believe me now? - Let me see it. - I'm gonna let you see it! - I can't see it from here! - Then come get me! - Nope! - Fuck! OK, fine. Oh, fucking good one, Snickers! - How long are you gonna keep this up? - Keep what up, man? - Do you really have a kid? - No. He's my buddy's kid. I almost had you though, didn't I? - Nope! No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. Aw, fuck! Come on, Nicky. Just get me back to the shore. - No way! - My life is already shit! Why are you torturing me? - Oh, let's see! You call me Snickers for 30 years. You fuck my fucking wife! - A whole bunch of people did! - Trying to sell the cottage out from under me! I don't know! I can't think of a reason! - That's funny, 'cause I could think of a few. - Jesus fucking Christ! - No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! - Look, you're not a bad guy, Danny. I know that. - Thank you. - You're not getting into this boat unless you swim to it. - You're a piece of shit! - It's time, OK? I know Dad threw you in the lake. I know that fucked you up, but enough is enough. Swim over here, stay over there. The choice is yours. - Look, it wasn't Dad, OK? It was fucking Mom! - It was Dad! - No! No! No, the reason why I hate the fucking water, OK? - Jesus! Enough of your bullshit, Danny! - Look, I saw Mom skinny-dipping with that fucker Vic! - What, with Kathleen's Vic? - Do you know any other fucking Vic, Snickers? Who else do you think she was having an affair with, you fucking idiot? Oh, Jesus! - I mean, I knew how to fucking swim! When Dad threw me in, just every time I touched that fucking lake, man, all I could see was her tits and his hands all over them and the fucking sounds they were making. Oh God! And Dad's face! I mean, I knew his wife was fucking around on him, Snickers, and I never told him, and now he's dead, and I never fucking will. I can't breathe over here, Nicky. - Look, you know why you didn't tell him? - 'Cause I'm a coward! - No, 'cause he would've gotten liquored up and beat the shit out of her. You were protecting her. - Then why the fuck wasn't she protecting me? Every supper time, she would send me up to that fucking boathouse to get him. I almost lost my fucking eye once! Do you know what the worst part of it all is? All I ever wanted to do was have a drink with the man! Nicky, get me off this boat! - All right. There's only one way off that boat. - I'm gonna fucking murder you! - I'm right here waiting. I won't even fight back. - You couldn't, you fucking pussy! Oh my fucking God! OK. Oh fuck! Why, fuck? OK. Oh, you are such a cunt! Oh my God! Oh, I fucking hate you so much! Snickers, you piece of shit! With your fucking perfect fucking wife and family. Oh my God! Oh my God! - Swim, swim! - Something touched my leg! - Oh Jesus! It's a shark! - What? - It's a fucking freshwater shark! Swim! Swim! It's OK, it's OK! I was shitting you. It's just an eel. - Eel! Jesus!- It's OK. Ah! Ah! That wasn't so bad, was it? - You're fucking dead to me. - Ah! A shark! Are you fucking serious? - I really thought there was! - You know, there's, like, 5 life jackets at the bottom of that boat, right? - Why couldn't I have had a sister? Oh God! - The kindling's soaked. - A real couple of boy scouts. - Come on. - So much shit to pack up. - It's nothing. Grab a box! - You know, I was thinking, maybe I could come to your place at Christmas and, you know, actually get to know the niece and nephew. - You're never going near my wife again. ♪♪ Steady woman, won't you come on down?♪ ♪ I need you right here on the ground♪ ♪ I've walked the outskirts of this town♪ ♪ Been terrorized by what I found♪ ♪ I saw a standing virgin bride♪ ♪ Where holy Dionysus died♪ ♪ She tore the heart out of his side♪ ♪ Then laid it there And there she cried♪ ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh♪ ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh♪ ♪ She said: "Hello, I'm a monster too♪ ♪ "What poisons me is what poisons you"♪ ♪ Into these animals, we grew ♪ ♪ But when we were young our eyes were blue♪ ♪ And I take my medicine on my knee♪ ♪ Twice a day but lately three♪ ♪ It keeps the devil from my door♪ ♪ And it makes me rich and it makes me poor♪ ♪ I'm a beggar in the morning♪ ♪ I'm a king at night♪ ♪ My belt is loose and my trigger's tight♪ ♪ It may come without warning at the speed of the light♪ ♪ Make it shine so pretty Make it shine so bright♪♪ Vision Globale
