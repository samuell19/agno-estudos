[♪♪♪] [MAN READS HEADLINES ALOUD] We must get this rocket-fuel formula for our country by hook or crook! Right! Without aircraft supremacy, Anemia could never conquer Urania. You and Klutz must visit this Professor Snead. Understand? Yes, Excellency. I will make the necessary preparations. I will make necessary preparations. [GULPING] [WHISTLES BLOWING AND HONKING] [CHUCKLES] Ah, by golly, that's good! Tastes like rotten eggs. Mm. Boys, we gotta be careful and make sure nobody followed us. Right! Shemp, that dame looked suspicious. You better follow her. Right! This is it. "Government of Urania, Department of Inferior." [TYPING TO "SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT"] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Come in. Operator Number 5. Six and seven-eighths. Ooh! Good, I've been expecting you. Make yourselves at home. Thank you. We will. Pardon me. Ha-ha-ha! Ready? Give. She said make yourself at home, not obnoxious! Oh, quit kiddin', toots. You know you loved it. Give me another kiss. [CRUNCH] Aah! Ow! Ew, what a kisser. Oh, glad you appreciate it. Yes, uh, let me see your hand. Certainly. Ooh, nice... Heh. [YELLING] Ooh! [WHIMPERING] Ooh, ooh. Hey, that was mean. Come on, be nice. Give me another kiss. Uh, sure, why not? Heh-heh. You pooch, and I'll pucker. [GASPS] Ruff! Ha-ha! Ready? And how. Aah! Ooh! Oh, isn't that fun? Ooh! Ow! Oh, you're breaking my heart. Larry! Larry, help me! Help. Larry, help me. Help me. Oh! Wait a minute. I'll get it. [WHIMPERING] Wait. Hold it still there. Ooh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Moe, it's out. Oh. Next time you'll remember you came here on serious business. Yes, sir. Ma'am. Now, you have been ordered to protect Professor Snead, the eminent scientist. You will work undercover. Yes, yes, we will work under covers. Neither he nor anyone else must know who you are. You will go to his new house and pretend you are carpet layers. Wait a minute. I can't lay carpet. Why not? I'm not that rugged. Get it? Carpets, rugged? [LAUGHING] Why, you... [HONKING] Ugh! Now, listen, you, we gotta find Shemp and get over to Professor Snead's. Number seven. Seven. Come on. Aah! Professor Snead's new house. I watched from here when he moved in yesterday. So we have him cornered at last. By now his super rocket fuel should be perfected. Yes, Roarke? Yes. I think we can persuade him to give us the formula. Ah, there he is now. There's no mistaking that magnificent head of hair. Hiya, professor. You got nothing to worry about. My men will have this job done in a couple of hours. SNEAD: Good. Whose men? Us men. That's better. Ooh! Come on, start cuttin'. [GRUNTS] [GULPS] [GAGGING] I swallowed the tacks. I'll-- I'll-- I'll be doggone. Oh, I'm sorry. Father, step into the laboratory. I've discovered something interesting. Just a moment, dear. I want you men to finish up as quickly as possible. My work, shall we say, is highly secret. Forget you ever came here. Is that clear? You betcha. We won't breathe a word. Good. Thank you, boys. [GIGGLES] [SCREAMING] MOE: My toes! They're gone! [WHIMPERING] Oh, there they are. MOE: So they are. [CLANGING] [CRUNCH] Oh! Ooh! [GROANING] [GRUNTS] [GROANING] Quit playin' around. We gotta measure this joint. Take this tape over to the other wall. Come on. How many feet you got? Two. You skillethead. Give me that tape! I'm sorry, Moe. You asked for it. You asked for it too, but we'll forget it. Get to nailin'. Yes, sir. Gladly. How did I get in the cellar here? When the professor comes out of the house, we'll capture him. You will take him to Anemia. Leon and I will remain at the embassy. Yes, colonel. Well, goodbye. STOOGES: Bye. Look. The professor has two assistants. Good. We'll take them too. MOE: We'll grab a bite of lunch and hurry back. We mustn't be gone too long. [WHISTLING] Where did those guys go that was here--? [GASPS] Oh! Let go. My leg. You're breaking it. Wait, whoa! Moe! Larry! [WHISTLE BLOWING] MAN: Here we are, gentlemen. What a joint. Reminds me of the reform school. Oh, did you stumble, professor? Aah! Anything wrong, professor? No, I'm all right. Guards. Follow this soldier, gentlemen. He will lead you to the laboratory. Say, I beg your pardon, do you have any idea what we're doin'? Now that you mention it, no. Why don't you tell the general he ain't Professor Snead? He couldn't invent rocket fuel in a million years. I beg your pardon. Wait a minute, you ignoramuses. If they find out we're undercover men, they'll go back and grab the real professor. We gotta make them think we're really mixing rocket fuel, or they'll shoot us. Now, we gotta fool them, savvy? You're right. It's our duty to posterior. I wonder what this will do. Pyrogallic acid. Say, that acts mighty powerful. Yeah, if they put that in an airplane, something's bound to happen. Get some more stuff. Okay, okay. How'd that mule get in here? [SCREAMS] You don't know my sleeve from a jug, you jughead! Hey. It's burnin' the wood! Put it out, somebody! Larry, Larry, put the fire out! Larry, come on! Hey, it's strong enough. Let's cork it. Here's the cork. Okay, kid. There. [MAN SCREAMS] Top of the morning to you, captain. And the rest of the day for myself. Ah, but there's good news today. Yes? You have the super rocket fuel? You said it. With that stuff, a plane can go 1400 miles an hour. In low gear. Splendid. Splendid. I congratulate you, professor. LARRY: Think nothing of it. CAPTAIN: You should give me the formula. Yes, the formula. Why, sure, sure. Tell him, professor. Oh, yea-- Tell him. Me? Well, uh, first you put in a half a pint of ectowhosis. Ectowhosis? No, no, ectowhatsis. Whatsits. Um, and 4 grams of alkabob. Ah, so. Then you pour in the shish kabob. Then you fold in the jigger of sastrophonia. Ah, sastrophonia. Say, did I give you carbolic acid? I'd love to. SHEMP: Put down a squirt of haratang. Spelled sidewards, it's, uh... Tahara... [CLICKING] How you spell this, uh...? [CLICKING] That's right. Put it down. Yeah. Hiya. [STOOGES GASP] [CLANGS] [LARRY GROANS] Colonel, what does this mean? It means you captured three impostors, you dunderhead. This is Professor Snead. Yes, and unless you give us that formula at once, you, your daughter, and your friends all will be shot. I am sorry, but I am afraid I can't help you. You see, general, my father has a very poor memory. I've got a little booklet here. "How to Train Your Memory in Five Easy Lessons." Pardon me. Quiet. Thank you. Don't point. Perhaps a night in the dungeon will refresh your memory. Take them away. March. March. What's the matter with you? Go ahead. All right, both hands were out that time. Beep! Beep! Beep! Heep-eep-eep-eep! I don't know what to do. How to get out of this. Look, boys, we gotta get the keys to the cell below from this guy and release the professor. Now, look, we'll straighten the whole thing out, right? Shemp, guard the door. Heep-eep-eep-eep. Routine number 6. Okay. I personally brought you your last meal, before you are shot. Heh-heh. Eat hearty. Pigs' feet smothered in lubricating oil, raw potatoes boiled in pure varnish, and headcheese garnished with nails. Rusty nails! [CAPTAIN LAUGHING] Ah-ah-ah-ah-- [SNEEZES] [GASPING] [CLANG] [CLANG] [CLANG] Shemp, come on. Let's get him in that trunk. Up you go. Now these are the keys to the cell below. We gotta get down there somehow. Yeah, but there's a guard outside. I got it. That rocket fuel we made, it burned a hole in the table. It'll burn a hole in the floor. Right! He's the most intelligent imbecile I ever saw. Hey. How about me? Oh, you're much smarter. You're just an imbecile. Here it is, fellas. Get busy and make that hole. We'll watch the door. Come on. [LARRY GROANS] [GASPS] Are you all right? [SHEMP SCREAMS] [SHEMP GRUNTS] Seize him! [GRUNTING] Whoa! [CREAKING] Moe! [SHEMP GRUNTING] Oh! [ALL GRUNTING] SHEMP [STRAINED]: My neck, my neck! You're killin' me! Wait! You're killin' me! I'll give up! Let go! [BOTH GROAN] Hang on! Whoa! Call the guards! Don't let 'em go! Call the guards! Come back here. Stop it. Stop, help! Halt! Help! Help! What's the guard's name? [BOTH GROAN] BOTH: Help! Help! Quick, get in the jeep! We'll make a dash for it. All right, start her up. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] MOE: It's empty. We're cooked. Oh, no, we ain't. I got the stuff. I got the stuff. Hey, wait a minute. That ain't gas. It may not be gas, but it packs an awful wallop. Ah! Stop them! Shoot! Whoa! Ah, come on. Come on. [ENGINE STARTS] [ALL SHOUTING] [♪♪♪]
