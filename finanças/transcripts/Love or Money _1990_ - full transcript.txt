Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Great, man, you're early. Listen, Reed, in six months this building is going to be a big pile of dirt, and you're going to be left holding the bag, pal. Now if you know what's good for you, buddy, you'll listen to me. Reed, you gotta get out. We're gonna get you out. Time waits for no... No. No, no, no. Mr. Reed, sir, look upon this as an opportunity to keep a couple of really good guys out of debtor's prison. We're able bodied, willing to work and we're going out of business, you know. Be a hero, sir. It's... It's not really charity, it's decency. Simple human decency. You want me to beg? [TOILET FLUSHING] I'd go with the second rap, man. Reed & Reed. Good morning. Well, I'm sorry. He's not in yet. I've give you a secretary. Hold on. Christopher Murdoch. I'll just check with his office. Go ahead. Why don't you have a seat? Okay. Yes. Mr. Murdoch. I wonder how old this thing is? Older than you, Mr. Entrepreneur. Oh, shit. What a pleasant surprise. Do you enjoy being out on your own? No question about it. The company is much better. I wonder, Murdoch. How do your clients react when you take them to lunch at McDonalds? Look, I've had it with you guys. You steal my clients, you jump on my deals, you give kickbacks... Murdoch, don't you see? We're about to financially crush you. BASKIN: Cripple you. And count on it, destroy you. Mr. Murdoch? Mr. Reed is expecting you. Go right in. Thank you. Stop that. Hello, Mr. Reed. I'm Christopher Murdoch. Hello, Chris. Good to meet you. Come in and sit down.Thanks. Hey, what the heck were these things like to play with anyway? Metal strings, wooden handles. You stayed out there too long, your arm fell off. Sort of like playing with a frying pan, huh? Sort of. Tell me about yourself, Chris. Well, my partner and I were with the number one firm in the city. When we left last year, we were their top producers and, now we're out on our own. You certainly come highly recommended. Well, great, I'm glad to hear that. Hopefully you'll be recommending us someday, too. Now, Mr. Reed, I understand that you have to vacate this building by the end of the year. Is that right?Yup. And I'm not too happy about signing a new lease at today's rents. Well, I can't blame you and that is exactly why we've come with this proposal. Now briefly, it's this. Rather than leaving everyone here in Manhattan, why not put your clerical operations in the suburbs where everything is much cheaper. Then you put your executive tier in a prestigious building here in Manhattan. You save a lot of money, and you're enhancing corporate image. Interesting concept. Are you sure you can handle a deal this large? Absolutely. Take a look at that. That should answer any questions you might have. I'm anxious to go over it with you as soon as possible. As you probably know, a deal has to be in place by Labor Day. That's no problem at all. Can I call you Monday?Monday is Memorial Day. Most of the world is taking a holiday. Make it Tuesday.Tuesday, that's great. Do you really play or was that just salesmanship? No. I play, a little. Ever play in the Hamptons? Yeah, as a matter of fact, my partner and I have a house out there. Well, if you're not busy this weekend, we're having a few people in for tennis. Sort of a family tournament. You'll find us just a little bit beyond the Harbor Club in the Springs. 2:00, Saturday, hmm? Bring your partner. William, why are my people still waiting outside? Hello, Arthur. Chris Murdoch. Chris, Arthur Reed. Chairman of the Board. Chris' company could be handling some of our real estate needs. He's come up with some very interesting ideas about our move. How do you do, sir? I told you to ask Baskin and Bradley about that. I'm seeing them next, Arthur. Well, Chris, thanks. See you Saturday. Saturday? At the house? Next, you'll be inviting the steno pool. You. Don't you think for one minute that you have this deal wrapped up. We're going to make our move on a competitive basis. It will be, Arthur. Thank you for your time, Chris. William, I'm not going to stand for you making up your mind without interviewing a firm that has an established reputation. Ladies and gentlemen, the hardest working man in show business. Wow. Jeff. We're saved. We're saved? We're personally liable for the rent here. Stop that. Konstanopolous, we're gonna end up working in his coffee shop. I said, stop that. You told me... You told me you read the lease. Leases? Lawyers read leases. He's breaking away. There's nobody on him. We couldn't afford a lawyer. You told me you'd take care of it. Why? You don't remember any of it?The shot. No good. Chris. How did it go? Perfect. Wonderful. Totally deluxe. We are on our way, pal. All thanks to our new best friend, Uncle Willy. He snags the ball from Simon. He's up. Stop it. Stop it. Talk to me. What happened? We did it. We are in the running for a 100,000-square-foot relocation. You figure it, pal. Well? Oh, my God. $1,100,000. What do you mean, "in the running"? Oh, just a few minor details. Like what kind of minor details? Like Baskin and Bradley details? Jeff. Jeff. Confidence. Listen, first we kick Bradley and Baskin's collective butts, second, we get the big commission. And third, we have got the edge because we are playing tennis at Uncle Willy's on the Island on Saturday. Look, Jeff. Ta-da! Visual aids. Sounds great, as long as the Nazi twins don't show up. Besides, if the deal isn't until Labor Day, where do we get $17,630 to stay in business until then? Aw, come on. We must still have some money from the Empire deal. You cannot let these minor setbacks get to you. Focus on the big picture. Excuse me. The shot. He makes it. The crowd goes wild. We win. Okay, pal, I'm outta here. I have to go meet Allison and let the tenants in. You coming? Chris, today is Thursday. I'm coming out tomorrow. Tenants. Oh, come on. Allison's your cousin. You can't consider her a tenant. These other guys, who knows? There'll be a house full of people, it'll make you feel better. Yeah, well, they're still tenants. About your therapy, I would ask for my money back. So you don't have any hot gossip for me? Come on. Well, Jeff and Susan broke up, again. This time I think it's really over. Personally, I could never understand the big attraction. She was such a wasp. You're one to talk. Besides, she wasn't that bad. "Be a dear and fetch me another cucumber sandwich, won't you?" [CHUCKLES] She was a bit Country Club, wasn't she? What about you? I don't know, nobody special. Me neither. But I am ready. [VEHICLE HONKING] Uh-oh, the new tenants. [HONKING] They're here. [CAR RADIO PLAYING] Hey, buddy. How the hell are you? Hey. Jesus. The traffic gets worse every year. Oh, man, you're still the biggest goddamned neurotic I ever met. I'm fine, Hank, and how are you? You're wearing such a dumb tie. Come on, take that crap off. Dumb tie? This happens to be...Oh, shut up. Come on, man. Let's go and hop over to Shangri-La. [WHOOPING] Hey, Allie. Hey, Jeff. Hank, this is my cousin, Allison. Allison, Hank Peterson. You're Hank? The infamous Hank? Somebody had to be me. I just got lucky. So, you're moving in?I'm trying. Let me give you a hand. Where the hell are your manners, Jeff? So, you gonna be around all summer? Sure looks that way.Good deal. Where's Chris?He's inside. The tenants insisted he go over house rules. Rules? What rules? This isn't a game show, you guys. This is the Hamptons. This is summer in the Hamptons. Get out there and party. Okay. Misbehave. Meet strange women. Drive at high rates of speed. HANK: Which should we do first? Hey, Hank Peterson. Our spiritual leader. Hey, guys, Hank Peterson. How the hell are you? Aw, man, I've been rode hard and put away wet. You guys got anything to eat around here? Huh? [REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ So ambitious ♪ You say you wanna be a star ♪ You're so ambitious ♪ But you really don't know where you are ♪ You told me everything was cool ♪ About you didn't need to go to school ♪ Knew everything right from the start ♪ Well, look at you now...

Do I have to remind you...Come on. Shh. Ready? CHRIS: Ready. What's this called? Frontal lobotomy. The bottle in front of it. Here's to a long, hot summer. Up yours, down mine.Bob's your uncle. Cassis, Kahlua, Midori, and Bromo-Seltzer. That's disgusting. All right. Vodka, Midori, slivovitz and grape Fizzies. Yours sounds a lot better. Well? Drinks on the real estate kings. [ALL EXCLAIMING] Right. Nice try, boys. I think I'll stick to beer. And Allison, you wanna dance? Who'd order one of these things? Great. Just what we need. Come on, Jenn, they look kind of cute. They're all yours, Molie. I'm gone. Hey, where you going?Home. What is that? A Frontal Lobotomy. Of course. See you tomorrow, Molie. Maybe she wants to try it. She could never get it. Get what? It's one of our missions in life. Every summer we try to guess the recipe. Looks like you're better off not knowing. Had any luck? Perfect record. Haven't guessed one. Doesn't look so hard to me. Oh, really? Well, I bet you can't do it. Bet the tab? Ah, Chris, if I could just interject... You're on. Hey, Zoo, can we have another Frontal Lobotomy over here, please? You got it. You still have time to back down. Nobody's backing down. She'll never do it. Give her a chance. Grand Marnier, Midori, champagne, Paul Masson Cabernet Blanc... Ew, Robitussin? [CLANGS BELL] You wanna dance?Okay. Did I just get hustled?Could be. Who'd order one of those anyway? Beats the hell out of me. Wait, wait. How about a rematch? We could try last year's drink. What stakes? If I win, I get you. Oh, and if I win, I get you? Yep. What's in it for me? Come on, I'll show you. Oops. I don't think so. Good night. Wait, wait. Does this mean we won't be spawning in the moonlight? I don't swim with sharks. Come on, get up. I found some more Tylenol. Can you please speak more quietly? Come on.Go away. Get ready.I am ready. You are not. I guess you are ready. [STRING QUARTET PLAYING] You look like I feel.Thanks a lot, pal. Oh, God, I hear cellos. You know what that means? Grown-ups. Welcome to WASP world. Well, let's do it. Hi, there. Nice to see you.Hello. We are never going to drink again. Hello.Hello. Would it be impolite if I threw up? BOTH: Hi.WOMAN: Hi. Oh, shit.Oh shit, what? Oh, shit. What are they doing here? This is not good. How should I know? Just relax. Keep smiling. Hi, there... Did you bring the hand grenades?I thought you had them. Why, hello. I'm Lu Ann Reed. Oh, hello, hi. I'm Chris Murdoch. Oh, yes. Jeff. Jeff Simon. Yes, well, Will's expecting you. Does he know you're here? I don't think so.Well, we'll fix that. Isn't it just a beautiful day. Oh, we got so lucky. Will? Will? Will. Yes. Oh, Chris. Glad you could make it. Excuse me, Pete. How are you, Mr. Reed? This is my partner, Jeff Simon. Jeff, William Reed.How do you do, Mr. Reed? I'll just let you boys chat. Excuse me.Thank you. Can I offer you a libation? Dimitri. What's your pleasure? Uh, Perrier's fine. Two.Thank you. Lot of people here for just a few people. JEFF: Chris? Well, you know, some family, some friends, some...Chris. Chris. ...some business associates. It adds up. It's a good way to start the summer. Mr. Reed, I wanted to ask you, that statue over here, is that made of stone? Jeff, what are you doing? Still looking to dance, Mr. Shark? It's Chris Murdoch. What are you doing here? Oh, slumming. Manage to fertilize any eggs in the sand? What? Spawning. I thought you were the expert. Look, last night was last night. I spent about an hour trying to take off my pants over my head so just gimme a break, okay? I'm trying to do some business here. What, more taste tests? No, commercial real estate. Well, that's certainly consistent. What an excellent occupation for a shark. Yeah? What do you do?Marine biology. Oh, how exciting. Well, maybe not quite as exciting as real estate. Actually, real estate can be very exciting. Oh, I'm sure it can be. Just like roller coaster rides, or guessing the contents of little drinks with teeny, tiny umbrellas... Look, it's been great talking with you and I'd really love to stay and chat... Oh, why not now? Because I'm with a major business prospect. If you'll excuse me... Jennifer. I see you've already met my daughter. Your daughter?My one and only. Jennifer's doing some research up the fish hatchery at Montauk Point.How fascinating. Unfortunately, she's only here until September. That's when the grant ends.Too bad. Well, at least this time, it isn't Bora Bora. Dad, it was Borneo. [CHUCKLES] Borneo? No kidding. You ready for some tennis, Chris?Sure, why not. Jennifer, this is Jeff Simon, Chris' partner. How do you do? And it's such a pleasure meeting you, Chris. For me, too.WILLIAM: Chris? [CHUCKLING] Will you look at that? The kid is 20 years younger and he moves like molasses. He does business the same way. Slow, with lots of errors. [LAUGHING] ARTHUR: I hope you all brought your winter clothes, because we may be waiting that long. [LAUGHING] We'll be lucky if we get on the court by Labor Day. Let's pick it up, Will, huh? What do you say? We're gonna be lucky to get on this court by Labor Day. Or maybe even Christmas. This is really bad tennis. Oh, pathetic. Arthur, please... Oh, Willie. I'm sorry. But just because you finally found someone that you can beat, doesn't mean you can take all day. [ALL LAUGHING] ARTHUR: Where did that come from? My God. I mean, what the hell was that? I'm sorry. Control problems. Control this. CHRIS: Hi, Jennifer. Nice fish. Goodbye, Jennifer. You got that? Yeah. As long as Reed knows we made the effort, we're fine. Provided we don't get lost, dehydrate and die. No shit. Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.What? Do you smell condos? I smell condominiums right here that we build. Don't you get it?Fine. We'll talk about it later. I'm dying and you're making deals. No way she does this every day. I think you're interested. Right, same way I'm interested in malaria. I know you. You're too defensive not to be interested. I am not.Are, too. Am not.Are, too. Am not.Are, too. Ass wipe.Douche bag. Dickhead.Butt face. You know, I really value the maturity of our relationship. Yeah, me, too. Dorksword.Meadow muffin. Skid mark.I know you are, but what am I? Steaming heap.Republican. JENNIFER: The lab will let us know tomorrow. With all the rain last night, we should probably check the oxygen levels. I'll check sodium too, okay? Yeah, thanks. Oh, no. He actually showed up. No problem. Just give them the five-minute tour. I think it's your turn, isn't it?Jennifer... Hi.Hi. Why didn't you take the road? You tell me. We just followed Jennifer's directions. The Children's Nature Trail? Nobody's done that in years. If you give me your keys, I'll get your car while Jennifer shows you around. Thanks. The children's Nature Trail? Oh, not wild about the big outdoors? Come on, I'll show you around inside. These are the freshwater clams I was telling you about. We're breeding them for seed. They're just little babies right now, but when they get a little bit older, we'll use them to replenish depleted beds. Why can't they do that themselves? Well, people keep eating them on the half shell a lot faster than they can reproduce. It's a fairly delicate system. We don't treat it all that well. Hey, Scooter. Got any lemon or butter around here? Please. You know, left to their own devices, lobsters can take up to seven years to reach a pound and a half. Here we've got it down to two. More food quicker. I'm all for that.Yeah, I'll bet. Come on, there's more stuff outside. Let me show you. Bye, Scooter. Can you two manage without me? I'd really like to go for a run. Oh, sure. Great. Thanks, Jennifer. See you back here in about half an hour. I hate to admit it, but this is actually very interesting. The station, I mean. So, what are these things called? Fish tanks. We're trying to recreate their natural habitat. It doesn't look so natural to me. Well, we try to duplicate their environment by pumping in seawater and so forth. I mean, you're right, it's not perfect, but it's about as close as we could get. You know, that's the first time you said I was right about anything. It's the first time you were right about anything. Thank you so much. You know, in a way this whole thing reminds me of gentlemen's tennis. [CHUCKLING] Really? How so? It's all a compromise, isn't it? I mean, this station is non-profit, right? Supported by grants.Right. Grants from huge corporations. Yes. Corporations that employ a lot of people who need places to live. Oh, I get it. Tract homes? Water you can't drink? Mini Malls? Okay, yes. Save the potato fields. Who needs houses? Equal rights for blowfish, is that it? You are deliberately missing the point. No, this is the point. You grew up in a beautiful house on the ocean. Where's the cutoff point? Your house? Mine? The next guy's? Yeah, what do you care, as long as there's money in it? Now you're missing the point. And what's wrong in making money. It's a creative thing, Jennifer. As a matter of fact, as far as I'm concerned, the definition of making money... Whoa! Oh, Lord. There's no way that guy was a doctor. Ow! I didn't see a single diploma. I didn't even see a golf bag. What did you want, pediatrics? Ow! If I wanted a second opinion, it wouldn't be yours, okay? Ooh, thank you. [EXCLAIMING IN PAIN] Hi.Hi. What are you doing here? Molie dropped me off. How're you feeling? Ducky. Nice robe, pal.Oh, it's William's. You know, you guys abandoned me with nothing but those sweaty running shorts. There was a horrible crisis. Help me out with Mr. Cranky, would you? Thank you. That settles it. I'm applying for a grant to live here. Don't start. I'm serious. I could really get used to this. WILLIAM: Good evening, everybody. Sorry, I seem to be running late. Hi, Daddy.Well, Mr. Reed, good game? Oh, frustrating. The Greens were fast, but the pace was slow. Shot an 83, not... What this? Uh... I slipped. Slipped up is more like it.WILLIAM: It isn't serious? Not nearly as serious as some of us thought. [CHUCKLING] Lu, forgive me, will you? I've really got so much work upstairs. But what about dinner?I'll send down for some sandwiches. Now, steady on, everybody. Thanks, Mr. Reed.You're welcome. Say, I like that robe. Wish I had one. Well... Croquet, anyone?Sure. Anyone else?I'd love to, but... [CHUCKLING] Oh... You'll call us when dinner's served? Sure. Well, alone at last. You know, even though that veterinarian you took me to today insisted that my ankle wasn't broken, you took care of me. Thanks. No problem. CHRIS: You know, if this deal goes through, I want to get a new car. An honest to God new car. Not a car with somebody else's 20, 30,000 miles on it. And you know what else? I want that new car smell. Why do they smell like that? I have no idea. Did you get a receipt on that? No. Actually, I've got a better idea. Let's buy the Hamptons. Sure. All of them? Seriously. Remember that cove by the fishing station? Yeah. Well, come on, man. Imagine what we could build there. Yeah, I can imagine Jennifer's picket line. Don't worry about that. If the deal goes through, Jennifer can have a fishing station as a private reserve. She'll count lobsters, we'll count money. Yeah, is this another one of your "sure things"? Yes. But seriously, what are your theories about that new car smell? I don't know from cars, what are you talking...Where does it go? Why does it go away? LU ANN: What time are you heading back to the city? JENNIFER: Couple of hours. I have a 4:30 appointment at Columbia. And then a date, sort of. Now what is a "sort of" date? I don't know. One that'll sort of never turn into a relationship, I guess. Sounds like one too many "sort of's" to me. Why don't you give it half a chance? Why? End of summer I'll be gone anyway. It just never works out. Oh, you never know. Men are like fish, once you've hooked 'em... Maybe. Speaking of which, this doesn't seem to be such a hot spot for catching fish. Well, who said anything about catching fish? Oh, my God, they just flop all over, get everything dirty and then you have to take them home and clean them. [EXCLAIMING] Dreadful. What are we doing here? Well, there's fishing, and then there's fishing. [MUSIC PLAYING] How many 100,000-square-foot locations do you show? Between 45th and 57th Street I show three 100 percent locations. Asking? $35 to $60 per square foot. Reed'll never go for the 60. What about the other two landlords? Shit, my screen went dead. Mine too. Power failure?I hope so. Let me check. We're nice guys. Why does stuff like this happen to us? You know all those notices from Con Ed? They weren't fooling. I'm interested in any solution you've got that doesn't involve money. Jeff... Jeff, you've got to have more faith in yourself. Now there are ways of dealing with these things. Just let me show you. Now, just watch me carefully. Calmly. It's really very easy. You're very nervous about it. That's the problem. Hello? Con Edison? Yes, this is account number 3231113. Murdoch and Simon. Right. I have an emergency here. A Dr. Albert Hindlegger insists on speaking with you. Hold on, please. I'm counting on you. WOMAN ON PHONE: Can you spell that, please? Hello? Hello?[IN GERMAN ACCENT] Hello. Yes. Yah, this is Dr. Albert Hindlegger. Hindlegger? Yah. All the people in this office are suffering from the same disease. It's an extreme emergency. They all need to be on on emergency defribulators. Yah. Numono Selecovil Caniasis. Also known as Konstanopolous Syndrome. Yeah, paranoiac seizures. Very, very contagious. [RASPING] [WOMAN LAUGHING] You think this is a joke? Well, I tell you something, you are personally liable. Health code. Page 83, paragraph 4. In an emergency situation you can have power back in one hour... One hour? [SPEAKS GERMAN] Sometimes I hate this city. It's all sealed up in cement. I don't know, it's so unnatural. You mean, it's not like the children's Nature Trail? Ooh. I thought we put that behind us. No, really, it's a complete ecological disaster. Jenn, tonight I don't want to hear words like "ecological." I want to hear words like, medium rare and al dente, and blackened red fish. You love fish.Yes, I do, but try eating one from the East River and live. You could, but you'd probably glow in the dark. [LAUGHING]Come on. This is New York. Show a New Yorker an eggplant growing and they'd think it was Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Here, you want fish? Here's some nice New York City fish, behind glass, packed in ice, convenient, sanitary... Jenn? Sir, this fish is under the legal limit. This man is breaking the law. See? Four and a half inches. Jenn, we'll call the FDA tomorrow, okay? This fish was not big enough to spawn. No babies, no new fish. Look, lady. Fish is smiling. I tell you it spawned. Give back fish, lady. No, I won't. I'm confiscating everything under the legal limit Citizen's Arrest.Jenn, give him back the fish. You nuts, lady. You no touch my fish. Oh, you got it all over my new dress. I'll use this if I have to. Ahhh! You come back here! Here, hold this. Cover them. This yours? [LAUGHING] You are some piece of work. Citizen's Arrest? I love a man who can hold his liquor. Chris. Help me get it in. Don't feed me straight lines like that. We should say goodnight. Goodnight. [DOORBELL RINGS] Who is it? This clashes with all my suits. Thanks. Goodnight. Goodnight? Goodnight. Where did you learn to do that? [CHUCKLES] [SNAPPING] Hey, pal. How's it going? MRS. KONSTANOPOLOUS ON PHONE: You know, in Greece my husband was professional wrestler. He don't like their hairstyle, he break their noses. Hello, Mrs. Konstanopolous. As I was just explaining to your husband, we're projecting tremendous revenues for the upcoming fiscal period. KONSTANOPOLOUS: Look, college boy. We come over and talk about my cash flow problem. Now. [DISCONNECTS CALL] Great, man, we had to rent space from a Greek tag team. Her mustache is thicker than his. Can we make the rent?What? Can we make the rent?Nope. Things don't seem to be going too well, boys. Oh, shit. See what happens when you leave food around. Rodents. Don't you think it's about time you boys came home? You can't afford us anymore. What would it take?Oh, your pictures on a milk carton. [CHUCKLES] Cute. So tell me, Christopher, is it true love with Arthur's niece, or just Daddy's money? Come here, asshole. Boys, we didn't come here to fight. In fact, with our help, we think you can bring in the Reed deal. And to sweeten the deal, we're offering you junior partnerships. Ooh. Junior partnership? That's right. What do you say?No. What?Not maybe, not even sort of. No. Now, if you'll excuse us, we have work to do. Look, little man, I'm warning you. We didn't get where we are today by tolerating little twits like you. And I promise you, you'll never get this deal. Why? Because you're big and established and have a wonderful reputation? No, because we cheat. [PHONE RINGING] JEFF: Murdoch and Simon. Hi. It's Jennifer. Oh, a personal call... Hi. It's Chris. Hi, Chris. I got your message. What's up? Not much, really. How's about you? Perfect. My lobsters had babies. The sun's out. Why not give the city a break and come on out? Oh, sure. I'll go cover Cityspire, you go have fun. You will? Hey, thanks, man, that's really nice of you. I know when your little head is thinking for your big head. What? He said that the office is really... [DOORBELL BUZZING]KONSTANOPOLOUS: Murdoch. Simon. Open this door! [BANGING ON DOOR]I gotta go. See you in a couple hours, okay? What's happening? Who is that? Nothing. Bye. KONSTANOPOLOUS: Murdoch! Simon! I know you're in there! MRS. KONSTANOPOLOUS: Boys, you come out, right now! So, your dad might have his company plane, but I've got an entire Air Force. What do you think, eh? Very impressive. Military man, huh?Oh, yes. Commander in Chief. Actually, I'm second generation. My dad used to bring my brother and me here every Friday night all summer long. We never got tired of it.You didn't? I bet your dad did. Who knows? My mom sent him out for bread and a quart of milk one night in 1968. Oh, no. Really? Yeah. He'd walked out before, but he'd always come back after a couple of weeks. My mom still thinks that he is going to walk through the door one night holding the milk and bread, complaining about the long checkout line. How's your mom doing? She's great. Worked for the phone company for 28 years. Now, she's retired and lives in a condo in Jupiter, Florida. Holidays. She hates the snow, so I have to go down there. It's okay for a couple of days, but how much bingo can you play? Know what I mean? Here, we go, pilot to copilot. [INAUDIBLE] Wait. Takes money, and I'm not paying for this... [BOTH GIGGLING] Hey, why don't you let me lend you a quick thousand. I've got plenty of cash. It's summertime. with me, no interest. Look, if Jeff and I go under, I'd rather stiff them than you. How about a suit for somebody who's past puberty? I could show her...No, no, that's okay. It's too complicated. I'll handle this. I've got some special suits downstairs, sweetheart. Be right back with your cash, Chris. Boo. You're out early. Must be nice. I'm studying a marine biologist. So I hear. What's up? Nothing. Normal credit card abuse. Uh... Hank just has to initial this. HANK: Here you go, sweetheart. Try these on. And try this one for me, will you? [CHUCKLING] Hey, Allison, I didn't know you were... How are you? Thanks, buddy.Anytime. Hey, don't forget to sign. Where are you running off to? Gonna check out some real estate and then check out Jennifer. Sounds good. Hey, don't forget the Wind Bake Clam thing. Clam surfing.All right. Saturday. Saturday.All right, buddy. Did you tell him? Nah... I was never much of a businessman. I don't know, I'll consider it an I.O.U. I think I'll take this one instead. Can you cut off the tags? Allow me. Let's stay in this bed forever, okay? We can order out for emergency champagne. I think the clam bake might send out a search party. You're right. I'm not sure I'm ready for this. [LAUGHING] You're ready. All right, shut up, you knuckleheads, listen up, or I'm going to pull your butts out of the water. Remember, keep your legs bent. Pull against the wind, don't fight it. The wind is your friend, okay? Ready to wind surf, you weenies? Yes. Yes.ALL: Yes Pull out that way. That way. That way. That way. [EXCLAIMING] Hey, here's a good one. Want it? No way. Not after three dozen clams. Oh, man, they damn sure died for a good cause. JEFF: You got that right. Whoa! DUDLEY: Can Clark and I have your attention, please? Oh, yes, I don't want to miss this. Go ahead, Dudley. Living with you guys has been so fabulous, we wanted to thank you in some small way for all the fun we've had. So we worked very hard and put together... The first annual bonfire talent show. A tribute to your era. A salute to the sixties. ♪ Kumbayah, my Lord ♪ Kumbayah ♪ Kumbayah, my Lord ♪ Kumbayah DUDLEY: Everybody. ♪ Kumbayah, my Lord ♪ Kumbayah ♪ Oh, Lord, Kumbayah [LAUGHING] How do you feel? I think even Clark and Dudley can't screw this up. They are so good. How's your deal with my dad going?Home stretch. The presentation is right before Labor Day. What about your competition? Oh, you know about the pit vipers? Yeah, I know that Uncle Arthur prefers them. Well, Uncle Artie don't know his can from third base. Besides, our deal is much better. You know who I'm rooting for. What are you going to do with the money? Set up some grants for some incredibly gifted young marine biologist? Ah, well, we have to see if there's any personal favors that come with that, then maybe...Right. How professional. Actually, I have a plan. Yeah, what is it? It's so perfect. Now, just keep an open mind on this, all right? Listen to the whole thing before you make up your mind, okay? Sure. I want to buy the cove, Jenn. It's available, and the great thing is, you can leave the fishing station right where it is. I'm waiting for the rest of the idea. Well, Jeff and I would do some building. Building? Like what? Condos? Homes. Nice ones. Nice ones? What are we talking about here? I'm talking about houses, you know, where people go after work. Don't patronize me.I'm not patronizing you... Do you have any idea what impact that would have on the cove? God, Chris, it's one of the last unspoiled areas we have around here. God, it'll be just like the rest of them. Row after row of simulated...No, no, no... Wait. Wait. I'm not talking about spoiling it. I'm talking about enhancing it. I'm talking about spending whatever amount of money it takes to do it beautifully... This is Jenn you're talking to here, Chris. Don't con me. Con you? Welcome to the rest of the world, Jenn. I'm just out there trying to make a living. I can't afford to be so goddamned noble. You son of a bitch. Thanks for hearing me out, Jenn. This one's for you, Chris. The real estate king. ♪ Only in America [VOCALIZING]♪ Can a guy from anywhere ♪ Go to bed a pauper ♪ And wake up a millionaire ♪ Only in America ♪ Can a kid without a cent... ♪ WILLIAM: Jenny? You haven't caught me sneaking in, in years. You haven't really been home in years. I guess not. Something wrong? Come on, kiddo. Nothing. Just everything. Chris wants to build a development around the fishing station. That's big money. The commission on your deal is big money. Well, he's a bit premature. That deal isn't his yet. If I had my way, it would never be. Do you really mean that? It would probably mean Chris and Jeff will be put out of business. I know, but if it's a choice between what's good for business and what's good for the environment... God, you know where I stand. I guess I do. Well, Arthur wants his people to handle the deal anyway. There's something about them, though. You're absolutely sure about this? Why don't you sleep on it? I can't. I'm sure. Good night, Daddy. Good night, Jenn. I love you, kiddo.I love you, too. This sucks.What is it with you? What do you think?Forget women. Oh, my God. If we don't make this deal, I'm going to forget what business we're going out of.Yeah, okay. Dial 911. Let's rock n' roll. [INAUDIBLE] [SNORING] [INAUDIBLE] JEFF: Come on.WOMAN: I have to go. JEFF: No. [WOMAN LAUGHING] Come on. No, no, no, no. You can stay for another five to 38 minutes. [LAUGHING] No. I'll see you in the morning. [CAMERA SNAPPING] What the hell is wrong with you? Are you out of your freaking mind? I didn't think you'd be back tonight. You lunatic. Be careful with Jennifer, Chris. You might blow our deal. Me? My little head is thinking for my big head? At least mine can still fucking count. It knows how much a million dollars is! Obviously, yours doesn't. Damn it! Well? I love her. Oh, shit. What about her? She'll never leave him. She loves him. I wish I knew what to say.There's nothing to say. I know I should stop it. I shouldn't see her, but then she calls. What does she say? She says I'm her summer love. Summer's almost over. For both of us, pal. You know, it's funny. For the first time in our lives, we're this close to really big money, and you're sleeping with the boss' daughter and I'm sleeping with his wife. You can't fault us for strategy. [LAUGHING] Listen, the presentation's tomorrow. We're gonna make this deal work if it kills us. In the words of Gary Gilmore... "Let's do it." William?Yes, Arthur? I've got Laura Baskin on the line. She's been trying to get through to you all day long. I want you to talk to her now. BASKIN: Hello? Hello? I don't want to talk to her.Why not? You told me you weren't gonna use Murdoch and Simon. What are they doing out there? I've got to let them make their presentation, it's only fair. Oh, come on, never mind fair, William. We're running out of time. Talk to Baskin. BASKIN: Hello? Hello? I said, "No, thank you."Oh, I see. Apparently, you're still suffering from some warped sense of responsibility to those two kids out there, with everything going on behind your back. Just talk to Baskin. Hello, Arthur? What are you talking about? I could tell you things about your daughter, about your wife, but I won't. Arthur, if I hear one more innuendo about Lu Ann or Jennifer, I'll have you out behind the barn. We'll settle things the way we used to. Not the way we used to, oh, no, no, no, Will. This time we'll use the tennis court. The tennis court?Mmm-hmm. Meaning what? Meaning tomorrow at the club. The Labor Day Doubles Tournament. So, we play a grudge match before the entire club? That's right.Arthur, you've gone too far this time. Too far? Oh, yes, I forgot, you always did have a weak backhand. What are we wagering on this match? That watch. The one the Old Man gave you. You've always loved it. Bet that. My watch? Against what? Any painting in my collection, except the Renoir. BASKIN: Hello, Arthur? Is this you? Hello? Hello? William? No. I'll bet the watch against your membership in the club. What?It's very simple. If I win, you're no longer a member. It would be so peaceful. Okay, you have got a bet. Look, William, do you want me to call back? If it'd be more convenient, I'd be happy to. Hello, is anyone... [DISCONNECTS CALL] Well, that's it, Mr. Reed. I think you'll agree that's everything we promised. You're right. It is a very thorough and detailed proposal. Great. Then we'll make the offer today. It might be better to wait a bit. With your time problems, we really ought to lock this up. Well, there are a few other proposals on the table. Other proposals? I see. Well, thanks for your time. Hello? Yeah, it's DeMartino. I got just what you want. Find out where Reed is this weekend, and I'll meet you there, okay? What else can I get? Jesus, I don't know what else these two can do. Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Mr. Bradley. I'll meet you there. CHRIS: Hey, man, at least we still have the house. Not for long. Konstanopolous and the IRS are going to share this place next summer. [SIGHING] It really burns my ass, though, that Bradley and Baskin are going to get our deal. Really, I still can't believe Reed dumped us like that. Ah, who else can it be. Shit, it's locked... Surprise. [ALL CHEERING] All right, Donald Trump Jr! Congratulations, you guys. Hey, come on in, have a beer. Relax. You guys did it. You did it. [TIRES SCREECHING] Well, I really think it's time we talked. Lady, are you crazy? I almost got killed. Put that away, will you? Not until we talk. Talk about what? About what you do and who you do it for. I can't do that, that's confidential. Then I'd like you to do something for me. When I ask you a question, I want you to just think of the answer. Say it in your mind. You got it? Now, how much are you getting paid? Lady...Uh-uh. Just think the answer. Add a zero. Now, who's that you're working for? Lady, I'm working for you. [POP MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, it's tough out there in the world of investment banking. What was it you said you did? Uh-huh. Uh, can I get you a drink? So you don't dance. You don't drink. What do you do? Look, I gotta get out of here. And miss all the fun? I just don't want it to be over. But I told you about the detective. What else can we do? I don't know. I don't care. Of course you do, Jeffrey. Think of all the people we could hurt. Now, you and I have just had a wonderful summer, but summer has to end. Why? We're so good together. You are a true romantic, Jeffrey. I love you. I know, darling, you're supposed to. [PHONE RINGING] Jennifer? Jenn? JEFF: Oh, God. What is this? Beirut? Western civilization is going to hell in a fakakta handcart? Jeffy is gonna have... Jeff, babe. How is it hanging? I really love your house, Dudley.Java. Thank you, sweetheart. Hi, you must be one of Dudley's tenants. Hiya, cherubs. Wake up. I've got something here to soak up the booze. Whoa. Hi, honey. See if you can find me some clean dishes, huh? Yeah. And, uh, bring some more coffee. I'll, I'll help.JEFF: This is horrible. You don't know the half of it, pal. You know, I am sick and tired of this goddamned soap opera. You know, it's quite simple. Get your ass over to Jennifer's, or quit complaining. I told you, it's too late. So? Get over there or you're a damned fool. He's right. Get off my back, would you? Oh, that's right, throw donuts. Here, have all of them. Spend the rest of your summer with Clark and Dudley. You are right. [LAUGHING]...grabs the umpire under the chair and pulls him back down to court. And swearing, oh... Hi, Dad. Jennifer. What time is your plane? Please sit. 5:20. Gotta get going pretty soon, though. And you'll be around for the match? I don't know, what match? Al, you know my daughter, Jennifer. Yes, of course. Good to see you. We are on 15 minutes, Will. You better suit up.Who are you playing? Ah, William, there you are. I've been looking for you. Now, listen. We're going to play tie breakers, if it gets to six-all in any of the sets. Not that I think you'll ever get that far. [LAUGHING] Hello, Jennifer. Whatever you say, Arthur. Have you told Al and Jennifer what we have wagered on this match? Look, Will ,this is supposed to be a friendly game. Relax, Al. This is between Arthur and myself. Oh, come on, Willy, don't, be so modest. I think everyone should know that I have bet my membership in this club against that damn watch of yours. Will, I'm starting to get a little uncomfortable about this. Wait, I don't like it either. Well, I love it. Have you got them? You got something for me? Of course. It better be good.Don't worry, Mr. Bradley. Those pictures, will change your life. Fine. Now, get out of here. Been a real pleasure, ma'am. No, really. He bet his watch? The one his daddy gave him? Yeah, can you believe it? Now what could Arthur have done to upset your daddy so? I don't know, and this wasn't one of their petty squabbles. This was serious. Poor Al McDonough... Al? Is he your daddy's partner? Yeah, and he had no idea that this was anything but a... Darling, sometimes when two dogs are fighting, you have to throw cold water on them. I think I have just the bucket. I'll be right back. Arthur? Best of luck.Ah! Thank you. Not that you'll need it. Perhaps after you've beaten him on the court, you'll want to show him these. You two amaze even me. Pretty hot, huh?What is this? I know Lu Ann jogs. So what? Jogs? Let me see those. That goddamned DeMartino, these were supposed to be... I know what they were supposed to be, but you two idiots blew it. Now, listen, I can deal with rats, but not with incompetent rats. Jeez, God...Arthur, I'm sure that I will be able to straighten this out. I mean, I certainly hope this doesn't affect my deal... Your deal?Deal? What deal? I wouldn't give either of you clowns the right time of day. Get out.Arthur... Oh, get out. Get the hell out of here. The two of you just get the hell out! Get out! Oh, Al? Al, could I see you for just a moment? Hello, Lu Ann. Uh, this match, I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Well, Al, dear, that's just fine because you're not going to play it. What do you mean I'm not going to play. Of course, I'm going to play it. Will's depending on me. I've got to play it. I see. Al? I believe that you know Janey Tupper, Henry's wife? Uh, yeah, uh, of course. I mean, uh, they're, you know, club members, aren't they? Well, rumor has it, reliable rumor in fact, that you're the one who's been putting slice in Janey's serve, if you know what I mean. Slice? Mr. Reed?Hello. Have you seen Jennifer? Well, she's certainly not in here. Will?Yeah, yeah. Come on in. Well, thank you anyway. Are you ready, partner?Excuse me. Will, my blood pressure is way up. My heart's pounding. I'm upset. This whole thing between you and Arthur... I mean, the stakes are too high. I'm bowing out. Calm down. Hey, wait a minute... Al, no, no, I need you. How am I going to win without you? Well, I'm afraid that I gotta just go somewhere and lie down. So, excuse me. I'm sorry. How about me, Will?Excuse me? I could take Al's place. Forgive me, Chris, but I've seen you play. Will, you've never seen me play. Yes, I have. What are you talking about? You let me win. You were buttering me up to get the deal. Chris, I thought better of you. Okay, maybe I was wrong. But give me a break. You killed something that was very good for your company because your daughter had a fight with her boyfriend. I suppose so. Well, if you choose Baskin and Bradley, you'll get exactly what you deserve. Right now, my concern is walking out onto that court in a few minutes, alone. Well, hey, I don't see anyone standing in line to take old Al's place. Neither do I. So, I'll play for the commission on your move. Run that by me again. It's very simple. If you and I win, Jeff and I will do your deal, and get the full commission. If we lose, we'll do your deal for nothing. What do you say? [SCOFFING] I say you're crazy. A million dollars? What do you say, Will? You could have called me and told me you needed this stuff... Just shut up and take your pants off. As if things weren't going bad enough... And while you're at it, I need a jock. And just when I'm trying to... What? I'm counting on you, Chris. I'm counting on me, too. What's going on? I thought you were going to stop it. I thought I did. And what on earth is Chris doing out there? Oh, ruining our business, destroying our lives. Arthur?Yes. Arthur, Al has had to withdraw, something about blood pressure. I'd like Chris as my partner. Well, that wasn't part of the bet. As a matter of fact, I have every right to have you forfeit this match. As a matter of fact, I ought to...I must intimidate him. Are you kidding? [CHUCKLING] I saw you play at the house. You stunk. Then how about this? In addition to our original wager, whoever wins, gets his choice of firm to handle the move. But if we lose, Chris will handle it anyway and forgo the commission. You're insane. And you've got a deal. Give me just a minute, okay? What are you doing here? I happened to be in the neighborhood. Well, I've got a plane to catch. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Actually, I came to find you.Why? [CLEARING THROAT] Because I love you. I don't really... I love you. You do? I do. You've got a helluva way of showing it. I'm serious, Jenn. Everything is going to be all right. Trust me. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce the players. On my left, Arthur Reed and Jimmy Lorenz. Their opponents on my right, William Reed, [PEOPLE CHEERING] and standing in for Al McDonough, Chris Murdoch. Mr. Murdoch won the toss and has elected to serve. You bastard. Players, are you ready? Play. Mine. [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] [LAUGHING] Hole in the racquet, Willie? Love, 15. Are you okay?Yeah, same damn ankle. [LAUGHING DERISIVELY] Great get. Love, 30. Come on. Come on. [GRUNTING] Just hit it to the cripple. Chris, I'm gonna default. No way. It's just not worth it. Oh, baby. [BOTH LAUGHING] Sure it is. Love, 40. God, why don't they just stop it? There's no stopping it now, darling. Easy as pie. Just hit it to the cripple. [GRUNTS] [GROANING] [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] Arthur? Arthur, are you all right? Arthur, please. Come on, Arthur. Arthur, will you get up, please? Arthur, please. I can't. Jesus! Injury. Winner by default, Reed and Murdoch. [WHOOPING] [PEOPLE APPLAUDING] You were all right. You've got yourself a job. [GROANING IN PAIN] What?He did that on purpose. You little shit. You did that on purpose. That's a terrible thing to say, Arthur. What would you expect from a non-member? [BOTH LAUGHING] Easy.How about that, huh? Congratulations. Thanks. You know, I'm not going to be building those condos. You're not? What happened, your conscience get the better of you? No, just bad business. I love you. You do?
