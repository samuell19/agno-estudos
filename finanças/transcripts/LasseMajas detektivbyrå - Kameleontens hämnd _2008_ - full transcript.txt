My children. Here. Careful. So. Go! During the highest place in the deepest darkness. -may my dear treasure rest. Woe to him who tries steal my apple! Then the earth will crumble and the the highest shall be the lowest! That is my curse. You bastard! I can see that you casting lustful glances at my treasure! -Your Grace, I assure you... -Ut! Hurry up! No one will be richer than me. Duke Valle of Valleby. -But Your Grace... -Ut! No one should be allowed to steal my treasure. Barricade the gate! Lasse? Lasse? What are you doing? -I'm busy. Come on. -Stop reading. There's something fishy going on. I've been watching the jewellery shop all morning. Ture Modig keeps on with some secret package. -and Muhammad Karat is super stressed. Muhammad Karat is heading towards the museum. -What's so weird about that? -He had a mysterious box with him. He may be pressed for money by a villain. Maja, you're chasing bad guys that don't exist. You say, looking for a fairy tale treasure. -Colla. The chief of police. -Where he's going... How is life with you then, Lasse and Maja? Your right sole creaks, Lasse. -Listen, I have an important errand. -What are you going to do? -It's a... -A surprise? Yes, you could say that. Something that every police officer needs. For both benefit and companionship. -Welcome to Valleby! -Thanks. Welcome to Valleby! Like I said. -Are you alone? -Yes, I am unmarried. It has never felt quite right before. Once it was close to the eye, but she didn't have a clean slate. Quite a tragic story, actually. I meant if you were the only cop here in Valleby. Yeah? Yes, I am. Now I went away a little here. Yes, but in the police force you have to be one step ahead. Quite right. I really hope that you will enjoy working with us, Katja Örn. A mystery woman? But what did she look like then? -Mystical? -No, she looked happy. -And the Chief of Police too. -The police chief has a fiancée! -She came with the boat! -A fiancée? The police chief? Does he have nothing to do but meet ladies on business? It is not certain that it's his fiancée. Bring something good to the police station and congratulate from me. -Hi. -Hi. -She said yes. -To you?! Yes, to me. -What? -Barbro has said yes. -Congratulations! -What fun! -We are getting married. -It was the mysterious box. We have to celebrate and make a cake! Uh! Finally, a wedding. Thank you. It's been so long here in Valleby. Sit down. Please sit. Here you go. Hi. Come on in. May I present Katja Örn - my new secretary. -Secretary? -This is Lasse and Maja. My helpers. They have saved my poor neck many times. -Can't police officers wear uniforms? -We are not policemen but detectives. Well, Valleby is a quiet, nice and nice city. It is. But there have been some strange events of a criminal nature. That has to be admitted. -A whole row of villains. -And scammers. -But now the crime wave has subsided. -After rain comes sun. -Everyone? -It was as true as it was said. Now Valleby so lovely Sleepy again. -Sad. -No, but it's fun too. Tomorrow, for example. Election Day. We celebrate it every year. In memory of Duke Valle. Valleby's founder. -He hid a great treasure. -Yeah, it's just a saying we have here. That's why nobody found it, because everyone thinks it's a fairy tale. "Now Valleby is so wonderfully sleepy again." How can he say that? "Woe to anyone who tries to steal my apple. Then the earth will crumble"- - "and the highest will be the lowest." "The highest shall be the lowest." What does that really mean? What's that? There is the entrance to the treasury and the golden apple. What makes that you become the richest man in the world? Exactly. Duke Valle didn't want someone would be richer than himself. So he locked himself in with the apple and all their money. Smart. Something has to happen soon. I'm rotting. Conny, it's time! You're a free man. Valleby residents! Friends! It's time to crown the winner in Vallebybladet's competition! Valleby's most popular person. The winner is none other than our own chief of police! Bravo! The justification reads: The police chief meets all three characteristics of the competition -of how a true Valleby resident should be. Humble, wise and... Yes, the third we have not quite figured out yet. What could it be? As chief of police, perhaps I should beat a battle not to steal. Good! Yes! Honest! I'll carve those words in my heart. Thank you! Yes! Wait a minute, Chief. After all you've done for Valleby we have another surprise. We have asked Ture Modig create a bust of you. A quadruple life for Chief! He lives! Hooray, hooray, hooray! -Fructuous! -Yes, it's a symbol of death. -Death? -Should it be seen as a threat? -What do you mean by that? -Do you have any enemies? Impossible. The chief of police is Valleby's most popular person. I've been doing this bust for several months. But who would want a bust by the Chief of Police? It must be personal. The question is why? And who? We can take the evidence and check for fingerprints. Well, except for yours, Chief. I'm sure it's just a prank. There are no bad guys left in Valleby. No, listen, now I have to in and help Katja. She's so fresh... New, I mean. New at work, I mean. It's been a long time since we saw each other, you and me, Chief. Are you ready for a little play? Thief and cop? Thief and cop! Did you hear that, Daddy's little darling? We're going to be rich soon, you and I. "Honest"? Should it be something to brag about it? We have big plans for you, The Chief of Police. We thought we'd kill two birds with one stone, you understand. We will find the treasure of Duke Valle. But first, my dear Chief Constable, we will take revenge on you. The chameleon is a fast reptile Catching flies with a smile The tongue as swift as the Indian's arrow It's the chameleon's style Still I am green Still I am red The tongue goes out and the fly is dead Good morning, Commissioner. -Good morning. -Good morning. But the Chief of Police, What are you wearing? -I couldn't find my uniform. -Yes, but pajamas? Yeah, I guess I'll have to sign myself up for disorderly conduct. Yes, I have one in reserve. Thank you. I slept so badly last night. I had a strange dream. It's a full moon and most sleep badly then. Well, is it a full moon? Well, that explains it. And then there's that awful the story of the skull. It was probably just a joke. In that case it was a very bad joke. What a nice... What a nice thing you've done here. Orderly and nice. You look nice too. In uniform, I mean, when you're wearing it... -So yes. -Nice. I've searched for police chief plus skull and crossbones. There is nothing. Try skull plus bust. No, nothing there either. That's something we're missing. The Chief of Police is not very helpful. He's supposed to be be with that Katja Mås. Örn. I don't understand how he can think that she's more important than the case. -He's probably in love. -How do you know? -What? -That he is in love. -He seems a bit unworldly. -Is that how you get? Yeah, you just think about that person all the time. You can get a stomach ache and you burps a little, and then you can't eat. Not eating? Help, I'm hungry, aren't you? No, or yes. -Take another one. -Thanks. -Mm. They are good. -They are a bit dry. -Well, it's been there for a while. -How long then? Yeah, I'm... A couple of months maybe. -Maybe more. -Maybe it might. "Under the highest place in the deepest darkness." What is loud? A skyscraper? No, that didn't exist in the Middle Ages. "The earth shall crumble and the highest will be the lowest." What is high and might fall apart? A mountain? No, a volcano! What's that? Gently. -It was me a little egg. -But what do you think it could be? I would guess a reticulated python. Or possibly a Caucasian possum. Hand over the keys, Krister. Let children find out who laid the eggs. No, the light is broken, we can't go in here then. -One poor time maybe. -Ash, come on. But what about you? No, I'm not afraid of the dark when it is light. You'll be fine on your own, won't you? Now I got a very important issue. Oh, yeah, or... Good night. Excuse me! Excuse me! You can't go ...walking around with such dusty shoes... -when you are accompanied by such a beautiful lady. Yeah? Now I don't really have company. You've got something going on, I see it in you. What? Love is a stimulus for the heart, but locally assesses the mind. -You're welcome! -What do you mean by that? Being in love is like losing mind, it may be worth it. -I haven't seen you before. -I'm passing through. Lo and behold. Now they are so shiny that you can see yourself in them. Yeah, it wasn't bad. What do I owe? What you owe me you can never pay it back. I'm sorry? It's free. Yes, it's free. -Thank you very much. -Good luck with love! Check it out, I know what it is! A brockesin egg! What? And a chameleon. A chameleon egg. "The chameleon changes appearance to hide from their enemies." And it lays eggs. "Before the female lays her eggs, she searches a suitable place to put them." A suitable place... In a skull? Chief! The Chief of Police! And chameleon? With feet like a parrot, trind tail, 5 toes. And a whiptail. But it can hardly carry off a bust of granite. -No, of course not. -Chameleon? Chameleon... Wait a minute. Now it's ringing a watch here. I have it now. The chameleon is a fast reptile Catching flies with a smile The tongue as swift as the Indian's arrow It's the chameleon's style It was a song that I sang as a child, I think. That childhood... Singing and playing, juice and cookies. I was suddenly so hungry on something sweet. Still I'm green, still I'm red The tongue flies out and the fly is dead Still I'm yellow, still I'm blue If I ever get like that - in love - then hit me on the head. Sure. With something hard. There. Now Daddy has to work. should strike a blow so as not to steal. As chief of police, perhaps I should beat a battle not to steal. in my heart. I'll carve those words in my heart. I'm the chief of police. here in Valleby. Humble, wise and honest. But hold on to your hats, Valleby residents. -because soon you will see on other bananas! When I'm done with you, then you be ready to lock me up! -Hi. -Hi. -So good that you came, children! -Has the ring been stolen? Not at all, on the contrary! Muhammad and I were wondering if you'd like help out at the wedding? -With security? -Security? We'll keep an eye on things to make sure they're running smoothly. We have spy nets. We want you to be a bride's maid. - And you should be beak. Quack, quack. What do you say, kids? We really need your help. -Okay. -Of course we'll do it. You're going to be so handsome. Just wait till you see your dress, Maja. It is I myself who designed it. Good day, Commissioner! No, but! Chief of Police? It was a short walk, The Chief of Police. The chief of police? I'm really a bad guy. Right. -Are you trying to poison me, human?! -What? I want you to pulls out a map for me. I need to investigate The Valleby sewerage system. The tunnels below, to be precise. Because it smells like shit throughout Valleby! Lasse! Maja! Hello! Hey, you guys... I don't know if I was dreaming or if it was for real. -but it was something with a long tail and claws. -A chameleon? -Any kind of lizard. -Something suspicious was there anyway. -What did it do? It just sat there and stared like this on me in bed. -How is the Chief of Police? -I'm fine. -Good. Fantastic. -So nice. I would really appreciate it if you solved the case as quickly as possible. Not that it's anything dangerous, deadly or terrible. -It would be good if you solved it. Okay? -See. Thank you. I don't know... Does it really smell like shit? -You can have it. -What a strange sound you make. Yes, I have a bit of a cold, a little rosy in the throat. -Get the map sometime. -See. I'll get it out. Katya, it can wait until tomorrow. No, but look there on the floor. A hundred bucks! -I can't find a hundred. -Dog call? -On the floor. -What? Well, better luck next time then. Mm. Goda! Have you thought about who you're going to have as the best man, Muhammad? -Best man? -Yes, it's an honorary mission. The groom lets his best man take care of the ring. -All your servants. -Found in the lake. It must be someone who the groom can absolutely rely on. -All your ladies. -Best man... Available in the lake. It's usually the groom's best friend. -Yes, or a dear colleague. -A man with style. -Sense of tradition. -All your tens. -World Swan. -Aware. Nice! Sure, a man on which the coat is glued on like glue. -Flooded. -Let's not fight, boys. A friend who is handsome and worldly? Then I know who to ask. Available in the lake. All your twos. -Good evening, Sally Solo. -Police Commissioner? -Yes, I am. -What are you doing here? I thought you might wanted to interview me. It's not every day you get elected to the most popular person in Valleby. Just ask. Paper! Pen! Why did you become a policeman, Chief? I want to make life miserable for other people. -It's nice to fight with a baton. -Cool? I like to meddle that I have nothing to do with. But best of all put innocent people in jail. I have big plans for Valleby. I've been a real bore. Searched for lost dogs and wallets. But now you will see on other bananas! Yeah? Valleby is too small for me, I have big plans. I'm already famous, now i want to be rich! It is not easy to be humble when you're as flawless as I am. "Valleby, it's me." "The bust they made of me should have been made of gold, those cheapskates." "It was not a day too late", says the Chief of Police. -referring to his new title - "Valleby's most popular person". -Did he really say that? -Listen to this then: "It's nice to fight with a baton." He must be joking. "I'm already famous. now I want to be rich." "It's nice to fight with a baton." "But best of all is to put innocent people in prison." Him you voted for as Valleby's most popular person. One should not actually believe on everything you read. The Commissioner would never say that. What was this like? Full roll cinnamon bun? Good morning, Commissioner, and goodbye! -Police Commissioner... -Yes, I am. Would you do me the honor and become mine... Be your what? Friend? Dog warden? Life coach? Hairdresser? Best man, in charge of the ring and is the groom's right hand. Hold on a second. Best man, no thanks. I'd rather eat fried harlots. Do you really trust on this woman? Do you know how often the bride regrets and run away with someone else? What kind of dystopia is that? - I'm not running away. Not even with me? Chief, you must not joke like this... Come on. Coffee and a sticky raspberry root. Write it down! Sign up? -What is this? -That's not me. -Aren't you? -Yeah, that's me. But it wasn't me. Lasse and Maja know for sure! He didn't go to sleep then? Thank you. Sally Solo said that every word what was in the newspaper was true. It can't be. The Commissioner may have suffered from hubris. Delusions of grandeur or hubris. It can affect many successful person. What? The chief of police? -Which way did you go? -The usual way. You must help me. Come on! Those kids, Masse and Laja, think they're detectives. Put the coffee on! Do I look like a coffee maker? Yes, actually. Where is my map? One day you're Valleby's most popular person. On the second day, the newspaper says that you are an idiot. I don't understand what has hurt Sally Solo too much. -Have a look at such nastiness. -I don't think she was making it up. Or I think she thought that what she wrote was true. -It wasn't, of course. -No. -It must have been someone else. -She said it was the Chief of Police. It wasn't me, I wasn't there. Who was it? Katya, we could move in together, you and me. I need some help at home. With dishes, vacuuming and stuff. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm dreaming or is awake longer. There's nothing wrong with you. You're probably just stressed. And pressured. It may feel heavy to be so successful? Successful? If you don't see your own smallness on earth, you're in trouble. We will solve this. Here we go. What have we got? Good day. Good day. Look there on the floor! There's a hundred. No, I'm not buying that old man. Thousands, I mean. A grand. There! Not a grand either. What? I don't understand why you think that you can find money on the floor. I don't accept this. First you're mean and say mean things things, then you pretend like nothing. Have I been bad? I speak French, German and Urdu fluency. I have no intention to start doing the dishes in your home. Dish? I do the dishes myself. I don't need any help. Just now it sounded like you needed help with a little bit of everything. -Diska. -I do the dishes myself, I have said. -Is it something I've done? -No, no. Is it the cold? -Do I have a cold? -Yes. It's something about the shell. As if someone has scratched it. Lasse? Lasse? I read about The curse of Duke Valle. I don't care about Duke Valle. I want to know what's going on in town. Who stole the bust and put there a skull with an egg in it. But above all I want to know why the Chief of Police is so strange. If love made him like this I have only one thing to say: Love should be banned. No, but? It's no big deal, it's something else, something written. -Do you see anything? -Wait a bit. They're numbers, write them down. What is this? -Could it be some kind of cipher? -Maybe a safe combination? -A phone number? -A bank account number? -A code? -A serial number? I don't hate anything. At least it's someone who wants to tell us something. Not us, The skull wasn't for you and me. It was to the Chief of Police. Sleeping pills? Yes, I can certainly need. I know who I am. I am the Chief of Police of Valleby and I have been for 24 years. I'm already famous and now I want to be rich. No! No, no, no! I'm Valleby's chief of police and I do my job. You betcha! No, but what am I saying? There is only one explanation, Someone's after the Chief of Police. Or maybe he's gone crazy. Tokig? The chief of police is our friend! It must be someone who.. -What? -Trying to drive him mad. Nine, one, one, one, one, one... ...zero, three, seven, one. -Curious! -The church bells now? What's going on? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Where's the Chief of Police? Where is the Chief of Police when you need him? Let's go! The chief of police? Chief, come out now! Help us, please! It was him! It was him! It was the Chief of Police! What have I done? What have I done? What have I done?! Katya! What's happening to me? Why am I doing this? -Com. -Why am I doing this? There was never a case, it was The chief of police all the time. It must have been him ...who stole the bust... -and wrote the numbers in the egg. Just a bunch of numbers that don't mean anything. County Police Commissioner Eva Ståhl. -Police Commissioner. -The badge and the gun, please. You are a danger to yourself and others. March. Lasse and Maja, this is from Barbro, best to try it right away. -Would you do me a favour? -Yes, sure. -Would you like to be my best man? -Gladly! Those two are way too crazy. It is a ring with a real diamond, guard it with your life. A thief and a cop. So it can be. I have to pee. Maja, are you ready soon? I'm done. Is it really are we supposed to look like this? -You're fine. -I look like a marzipan. Marzipan pancakes are good...for Christmas... dipped in chocolate. Uh, yeah... But you see certainly doesn't look like a pig. By the way, pigs are kind and clean. And you're nice and clean. Or, I mean, you're not a pig. But still nice and clean. -It might be back and front. -No, the zipper should be in the back. -One, nine, eight, eight. -What are you doing? 1988. One, one, one, one. Eleven eleven. Eleventh in the eleventh. November 11, 1988. Do you understand? -I just have to go to the bathroom. -Wait. One, seven, three, zero. It must be 5:30. -Half sex. It's a date! -Please, can I go to the bathroom? No, we don't have time. Let's go! 17.30 on the eleventh of November. I just have to go to... Look here, Vallebybladet on 11 November. -1988? 4988. Look. The Chief of Police! "Today the Chief of Police outsmarted in Valleby a thief"- - "after intensive reconnaissance work. The thief has long eluded our city." "By constantly dressing up this villain has been hard to catch." Dress up? "Right now we don't know more about this thief than that his name is Conny." Okay, here we go! What have we got? A skull, a chameleon's egg, ...a crazy police chief... -one date and a villain named Conny. -I just have to go to the bathroom. -Wait! -The police chief is just crazy sometimes. -As if he were two people? Conny is an expert at dressing up and changes appearance like a chameleon! Conny Kameleont. Look! Conny is sentenced to 20 years in prison. -20 years ago. -Then he is free now. But why does he want to come back here to Valleby? For revenge. Let's go! -I just have to go to the bathroom, Maja! -No! We need to talk to the Chief of Police! It's the County Commissioner who's in charge now. -We need to talk to her too. -She is blowing her nose. What are you running here for? We have solved the case! We know who the villain is. The chief of police... Come on. - We haven't found anything. -And who is the villain? -No, there is no villain. -Tell us what you found. -The police chief is not crazy. He's a raving lunatic and should be locked up for good! Come on, Maja. What's wrong with you, Lasse? What are you doing? She... the aunt... the one in there... -The County Commissioner? -Is a male! -Conny? -Conny Kameleont! -Maja, he's on his way. -Understood. Come. I'm so tired of those the brats. But they have no chance to stop me. When a fast train is coming towards the final station... No, but look at that! Mass and Laja! Did you think you could fool me? Conny Kameleont? Two stupid little kids? I wouldn't think so. Here you are. Five stars! Hey, if we never get home again... -Of course we do! -But if not, then... When all this is over, I'm going to help you look for the treasure. It does not exist, Duke Valle's treasure is just a fairy tale. Lasse, wake up! Lasse! There is an opening here! -We're trying to push it out. -Yes. Conny... Come. -What a beautiful girl you are! -You too! Where is Lasse? I haven't seen him or Maja. -Colla! -Busten! Church! "Under the highest place at the bottom of the deepest darkness." The Church is the highest place in Valleby. Duke Valle's treasure is under the church! Conny is after the treasure and the golden apple! -Lasse! Check where the entrance is! -Police House! Hi, I'm from FRIS - confused right in the community. My name is Günter Bär, I am a psychologist. -Can I help you with something? -The police chief needs my help. Good morning, Commissioner. -What should we do? -Let's check over there! How does it feel now to sit as a wing-clipped chicken in a cage? I don't know what to think. Ever since the day I was elected to the most popular person in Valleby. -it has only gone downhill. Katja says that after rain comes sun. But I must say that after the sun rain will indeed come. Check it out! -Katya? -I just wanted to say goodbye. Where are you going? I'm going home now, it was too much. Katya, you have stolen my heart. He's crazy. It is complete madness. It's possible I'm crazy. But I have loved you since I first saw you. He is not in the fullness of his senses. The best thing would be for you to go from here now. So! March in the pancake! The chief of police? The Chief of Police? What's the matter with you, Have you had glosoup? -Conny? -11 November 1988. Conny Kameleont! So far he is green, than he is... Eyes faster! We will sink! I had thought we would play a game, you and me. Thief and Police. I'll give you several clues: Chameleons, eggs, dates... But it doesn't ring a bell. Kling-klong kling-klong. -Now we switch! -Okay. Can you get it? Hurry up! Ös! Quick! Soon the treasure will be mine. Conny Kameleont - richest in the world, richest in the world! Where is everybody? -The wedding, we have to go there! -We don't have time. -But I'm the best man! -Come on! It's locked! Muhammad's ring. Go! Go away! Hi! Hey! He's on drugs, we'll have to do this ourselves! -It's all dark. -Here. Come on, then! Hang in there, we'll be back! -Where are Lasse and Maja? -Or wrestling? Slagerga? No, go on. It's so beautiful. What are you doing with this? Scratch your back or what? You came back! I didn't trust the psychologist, so I made some calls. There was no FRIS. organisation or some Günter Bear. What police work! -Stop! -What is it? -Someone is looking at me. -What? I feel like someone's staring at me. Check it out! Maja? We are gathered here in the name of love, for Muhammad to get his Barbro. And Barbro joins with his Muhammad... Maja? Maja? Maja? Lasse? Lasse here. Let's go! -I don't really know. Hi, my name is Lasse and my hobbies are stamps and treasure hunting. -but I think I'll stop it now. -Lasse! -Hi! Ow! You were right Lasse, it was no fairy tale. My dear beautiful apple that will make me so rich, so rich. -Richest in the world! -No! Don't do it! -What are you doing here?! -Don't touch the apple! The treasure is mine, the apple is mine! He who steals the apple will suffer the curse of Duke Valle. -I know. I've read the book. -Don't you understand? The earth will crumble and the highest be the lowest. The church collapses into the underground. We're being crushed! It's probably just a lie and cursed poem. The apple is of pure, solid gold and it's mine. No! As you can see: no curse bites on Conny Kameleont. In the presence of this congregation I ask you - Muhammad Karat: Do you take this Barbro Gunlög Ulla Asa Palm? -To love in sickness and in health... -Is your name Gunlög? Put the apple back! Do you take this Muhammed Mats-Olof Karat- -to love in sickness and in health ...until death do you part? Take this. Lasse, hurry up! -Hi. -Hi. Sorry we're late. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, then order was restored. Don't be so grumpy. Without your helpers, the treasure would have been mine. Children! It's like having a bowling alley in your head. Daddy's little darling! -What happens to the tax now? -It will probably end up in the museum. Then we must probably help guard it. Commissioner, I'd like to ask yourself one question... Then you can kiss each other!
