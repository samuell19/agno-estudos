[symphonic choral music playing] It's great to have the name on my record. But it wasn't no Larry Holmes, it was a legendary fighter. And if he was at his best, I couldn't stand a chance. And he's a great fighter. My father left home at my early age. And it was just my mother. My mother worked, she scuffled. She took every nickel and dime she could to clothe all of us. And remember, it was, like, 12 of us, 11 of us in the family. And we'd welfare, thrift plus, Salvation Armies and handouts or whatever you want, or hand me downs. That's the way we lived. And so I had something to fight for. I started my boxing career in an anti-poverty program, called the Job Corps. I entered the Job Corps to get a high school education, because I was a dropout at 16. Lyndon Johnson started this program for under-privileged kids. I went in, actually, to get another chance to play football. But it just so happened I found boxing. I went to college. I got tired of going to college. So I went home. My dad said, if you stay, you pay rent. So the next day, I joined the Marine Corps. And as a result, I played football in the Marine Corps for about-- for one season. And then they started taking people off the team. And they was starting sending-- sending them to Vietnam. So I looked around. The only thing that was left was boxing. And if you became good enough, you became more or less propaganda for the Marine Corps, and they wouldn't send you. I think boxing is the most outstanding game, sport-wise in the world. And I mean, kings and queens and rich and poor, and the robbers and everybody is in-- into the boxing. And boxing had made a living. They'd say, make money for everybody. So I have nothing bad to say about boxing, but love it. Just imagine, I had 112 amateur fights, all those pro fights you saw, and look at me. Look at my nose, in perfect shape, and lips, face. Now, I'm not boasting. And it's hard to be humble when you're as pretty as I am. [music playing] MUHAMMAD ALI: In 1954, [inaudible] and somebody stole my bike. There was a police officer downstairs, named Joe Martin, and he was training boxers, and told me to learn to fight, so if I find the boy who stole my bike I could beat him up. [music playing] I had medals, belts, titles, but no money. So I turned pro. [music playing] 1961, I made $3,000, and my mother paid off some bills. I kept a couple hundred. I liked that, and I kept fighting. I went down and saw Angelo Dundee and started from there. [music playing] And if this nigger thinks he can stir the niggers up, I will also inform him that the white men can be stirred up to defend what is rightfully theirs. [cheering] MUHAMMAD ALI: I'm only bold and cocky before and after fights. Let me see you close your mouth and just keep it closed. Well, you know that's impossible. No, no, now, keep it closed. You know that's impossible. I'm the greatest. And I'm knocking all the bums. And if you get too smart, I'll knock you out. Now, close your mouth. But just-- I want you to keep it closed for 10 seconds. Well, that's impossible. You know it's imposs-- Henry Cooper's nothing to me. If this bum go over five rounds, I won't return to the United States for 30 days. And that's final. Well, Cass, since you're not worried about this guy, Cooper, how about when you get through with him? What are your plans after that? Well, you're right. I'm not even worried about this big bum. Cooper will only be a warm up until I get to that Big Ugly Bear, Sonny Liston. Right, bodyguards? Right. Right. [bell rings] [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: Oh! And look, Cooper knocks Clay down. He's up in about three. MUHAMMAD ALI: I walked into London, England, I jumped off the airplane. Picture cameramen everywhere I go. You can look in the gym today. The TV, the cameramen, everybody follows me, I'm so great. [crowd cheering] The fifth round came. [grunts] I hit him. Yeah, I said, come on, sucker. [grunts] ANNOUNCER: Oh, there's a vicious cut over Cooper's eye. The referee is looking at it. He has to stop the fight. The man said to break it up. I said, there he is. There he is, and walked on out of the joint. ANNOUNCER: Clay wins by TKO. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Cassius Marcellus Clay. he's young. He's handsome. They know it. He's a poet, a prophet, and many people believe he'll be the next Heavyweight Champion of the world. I saw Sonny Liston a few days ago, Cassius. Ain't he ugly? [laughter] He's-- He's too ugly to be the world's champ. The world's champ should be pretty like me. Well, he told me to bet my life that you wouldn't go three rounds. Well, if you want to lose your money, then bet on Sonny. Oh, uh, may I ask you this-- Because I don't ever lose a fight. It's impossible. Tell him. It's impossible for me to be beat! Never lost a fight in your life! Ask any of my fans, when was the last time they lost? I'm too fast. -Champion from the crib. -I'm the king! -King of the ring. -Born the Born the champ from the crib! Ah! [bells rings] [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: And here in the sixth round, Clay has tightened, controlled the fight. Clay comes out to meet Liston. And Liston starts to retreat! If Liston goes back any further, he'll end up in the ringside seats. [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: Sonny Liston has never before faced this type of opponent. Liston's timing is upset by the young challenger's hit-and-run tactics. Clay swings with his left. Clay swings with his right. Look at young Cassius carry the fight. [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: Pandemonium has broken loose. Sonny Liston has not come out for round seven. Yes, for thou did not dream when they put down their money that they would see a total eclipse of the Sonny. Hi! I'm the king of the world! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! -I'm pretty! Hold it! You're not that pretty. I'm a bad man! Greatest thing out here. So great, I don't have a mark on my face. Yes. And I upset Sonny Liston. And I just turned 22 years old. I must be the greatest. I told the world! I talk to God every day! If God's with me, can't nobody be against me. And of Sonny-- I shook up the world! [music playing] I was moving like a sure shooter, a sharpshooter, a marksman. Everything that I went at, at that particular time, I made sure that it was on target. [music playing] I was the only guy in '64 that won a gold medal. Second Liston fight, it was luck. It was luck, they said. ANNOUNCER: Liston, in the black trunks. MUHAMMAD ALI: Clay came and beat Liston. So they came to me. I said, I've invented the Anchor Punch. And it's so fast, slow-motion cameras came to check the speed. ANNOUNCER: A short, chosen right to the jaw! Liston goes down. [crowd cheering] The champion refuses to go to a neutral corner! And referee, Joe Wilcox, tries to push Clay away! Liston still hasn't buried a number and doesn't have the slightest idea what the count is. I don't want to mess with your trainers. i just want you to know that from now on, you are the Rabbit. Floyd Patterson, the Hare, the Rabbit, George Chuvalo, the Washerwoman. And during the times we fought, I gave my opponents names. And I said, after retiring, there'll never be another one. And there hasn't been nobody since me. [music playing] I am the greatest. I'm pretty. Told you I'd-- I was cocky. So ringside I heard people saying, knock the nigger out. hit the nigger. These certain rednecks in the crowd. And black people themselves, they were humble. They didn't boast. So with me, all I amt he greatest, I say things they want to say, but they're frightened. They want to say what I was saying. They wanted to talk back to the white master. They want to take Vietnam. They want to be cocky. They want to be fearless. So they love me cause they saw that in me. And this is what made me so popular. [music playing] [crowd cheering] I never liked that word, killer instinct, cause my intention was to win, but never to kill, even when I knocked a man out. I was happy to see him come back to it. It's not the action that makes the thing right or wrong, but the purpose behind the action. My purpose was not to kill, just to win, look good, beat the guy. And only Allah, God, knows my intentions. Are you taking Zora Folley too lightly? Why would you say that? Because every indication has been that you're confident that you can beat Zora-- I'm confident I can whoop all of 'em. This ain't nothing new. My image has been confident. What you trying to make it look like something new for? I'm always confident. I whoop all of 'em. You're being extremely truculent. Whatever truculent mean, if that's good, I'm that. [bell rings] [music playing] [crowd cheers] ANNOUNCER: And there's Folley, down! [music playing] [music playing] [music playing] The question has been asked, what happens to a registrant who refuses to take the step forward at the induction ceremony? We believe in obeying the laws of the land. We are taught to obey the laws of the land as long as it don't conflict with our religious beliefs. Then he has returned to the ceremony room, given another opportunity to take the step forward which constitutes induction into the armed forces. Whatever the punishment, whatever the persecution is for standing up for my religious beliefs, even if it means facing machine gun fire that day, I will face it before denouncing Elijah Muhammad, and the religion of Islam, I'm ready to die. [music playing] REGGIE JACKSON: You were very largely responsible for the black community rallying after the death of Martin Luther King, to be a proud race. How do you feel about that comment, Kenny? Give up boxing for a while because of his religion. He was a man who believed in what he taught, what he said. REGGIE JACKSON: Mhm. And not many men would do that, make a statement and stand by it no matter what. REGGIE JACKSON: You respected that? I did. George, can I ask you what it meant to you, having a Muhammad Ali, a black leader, did that mean something to you? Limiting him as a boxer is injustice, because he inspired people in basketball, football, even actors, which see him and move up a notch. So this was probably one of greatest men of all time. As Kenny said, you don't find a lot of people who will give up anything. To give up what they worked so hard for, to-- just to lose it all to try to prove a point. I don't believe in, let's say, Muhammad's religious. That's his religion and if he believes it that's good. But I think if he had to go-- he didn't have to go to war. He didn't have to fight nobody. He didn't shoot nobody, I think he could represent the blacks as one of the greatest champions that ever lived, just going and waving his hands, yell hi. He didn't have to put a gun in his hand. Reggie, I can't take no more. [laughter] REGGIE JACKSON: You got to go-- you going to go after him? [music playing] LYNDON B. JOHNSON: Today we're able to announce that we will have open, and we believe operating this summer, coast to coast, some 2,000 child development centers serving as many as possibly half a million children. We called our program Project Head Start. GEORGE FOREMAN: I am a product of a compassionate America. I'm proof that when a country does not give up on its underprivileged, good things can happen. Probably it was the style to be compassionate during the '60s, when I got my push. Of course, things go in and out of style. And probably the last few years, it has not been in style to be compassionate. And of course, I think that things are leaning toward that way. And then when it does, everybody can comprehend people convincing the poor that they can't. Right now it's just not in style. [music playing] Probably the greatest thing that, when I look back on it, being a 19-year-old in the 1968 Olympics, you don't believe that you can do anything like that. They are putting that uniform on you, with the USA, and robe you down with a parade uniform. And it's like a dream. And it didn't end. Even now, to this day, it hasn't ended. Some kids grow up knowing that they're an America. I grew up out of the gutter, robbing and stealing, hiding from police. I was told at maybe 12 years old, one of my cousins caught me shooting hooky from school once. And I thought she was out of the house, but actually, she was still there. I thought she had gone to work. I sneaked in the window. My mother had given me the lunch. I'd ate my lunch, come back to sneak in the window, to go to sleep. I hated school. And my cousin told me-- when she caught me, I tried to make an excuse like a guilty person do. She said, don't worry about it. You're nothing. You're never going to be let nothing anyway. She said, go to sleep. She said, nobody from around here ever become anything but drunks. ANNOUNCER: That's it! Over to the corner! The technical term-- referee stops contest! [music playing] Generally we would bow to the audience or the judge to show our humbleness. This time, after I had won the match-- I actually had won-- I bowed to the judge. And I had the flag on my side. You forget about the complexion and all of this. You want everybody to know what country you're from. And everybody started cheering. So I started waving the flag. No demonstration or anti demonstration. It was just an emotional moment. I wanted everybody to know where-- that I was from the United States of America. MUHAMMAD ALI: We were named after our slave masters when we first was brought to America. We were robbed of all knowledge of ourselves. If I said, here comes Mr. Chang Chong, you'd picture a Chinaman. If I said, here comes Mr. Kruschev, you'd look for Russian. If I said, here comes Mr. Goldberg, you'd look for Jew. If I said, here comes Mr. White Cloud, you'd look for Indian. If I said, here come Mr. Castro, you'd look for Cuban. Here comes Mr. Lamumba, Mr. Kenyata, you look for African, a black man. Now, what's your last name? JOE FRAZIER: Whatever I get involved in, I wanted to be the best at it. And I want people to be satisfied. [crowd cheering] MAN: Let's go! Take him out! I would like to hear this from you! And I want the world and the cameras to hear it! Who's the heavyweight champion of the world? [crowd cheering] One more time, we don't want no excuses! They may say the film was bad or the camera was broke! One more time! Who's the champ of the world? [crowd cheering] JOE FRAZIER: I just look at a fight, at that particular time, like it was my job. And I feel if I can do a good job, well then I have to be good. And I have to study it and pay attention. [bell rings] [music playing] MUHAMMAD ALI: And we fought in all the wars! And we still fighting in 'em! And still a nigger! What do you mean, if I believe in separation? I've recognized the fact that you believe in it. That's what your people believe in. MAN: We don't believe in it. What do you mean, you don't believe in it? No, no, you just talking crazy. Every city I go to, I can find a black neighborhood and a white neighborhood. What you mean, don't believe in it? How many Negroes live-- how many Negroes live out here, just in this big old neighborhood? You can't blame a black man for wanted to leave all this mistreatment. You must be crazy. So what you mean, don't take white money? Only thing white about that money is the white pictures on it. What you mean, white money? If that's the case, I should take off these clothes. You made them too. I shouldn't fly in your airplanes. What am I going to do? Just do out and lay down somewhere and hide in the mud hole? [music playing] And after that, I would say, I think is wrong. But I see why at the time, the people that thought-- they did what they thought was right. I said, it's too bad they didn't recognize me doing what I thought was right. So it kept me out of the game awhile, made the comeback bigger. And most people recognized me mainly for my beliefs. I stood up for most of boxing. So I didn't believe in the war. And it was wrong. We shouldn't have been there. And I could see it. And later God made the word-- I turned out to be right. Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! [music playing] MUHAMMAD ALI: These boxing authorities, people who will rank Joe Frazier over me and rank him the champion when I've never been beat, I have the belt in my living room that John L. Sullivan had, Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marciano, Gene Tunney, Jack Johnson, traditionally I have the real belt. And for Joe Frazier to be a champion, he's got to beat me. See, those eliminations are only imitations. he's not the real champion. JOE FRAZIER: It had always been in my mind to face Muhammad. Because he was the guy that was always on television, running off at the lips and, you know, said what he can do. I said, you know, I don't believe that. Joe's going to come out smoking, and I ain't gonna be joking. I'll be pecking and a-poking, pouring water on his smoking. Then this might shock and amaze you, but I will destroy Joe Frazier. Is Joe Frazier your cousin? WOMAN: That's right. He sure is. And you think your cousin can whoop me? WOMAN: Uh-huh. -You really do? WOMAN: Uh-huh. Anybody on my-- [laughter] Anybody on your what? WOMAN: Anybody in my family, I think, could whoop you. Anybody in your family could whoop me? WOMAN: Yeah, except me. [laughter] I'm sorry Joe Frazier's your cousin. After I whoop Joe Frazier, are you still gonna come in here and buy Champ Burgers? WOMAN: Uh-huh. [laughter] WOMAN: Just say no. If I beat him, you're going to still buy Champ Burgers? WOMAN: Uh-huh. All right. WOMAN: But-- try not to. [laughter] Try not to. Try not to. Make a fist for the gentleman. [laughter] Boxers. Better watch out. Better not pout. Bring your hands up. Like that? To the side. Hold them like that? [laughter] Bring them down. Raise your left leg. Left leg. Left leg. And the other one. All right, let's see you exercise. I want you to do what I do. Bend down 20 times, touching your toes. As fast as you can. You do it 20 times. [laughter] You said, do what you do! [laughter] ANNOUNCER: No, I'm going to do that 20 times. He said, you do it 20 times. Fast, fast, come on. Let me have some action. Quick, [inaudible]. [laughter] MAN: [inaudible], My trunks don't-- [laughter] What happens if you're out there and the bell rings for the 11? Isn't there a danger that you having said it ain't gonna go more than 10, that-- So what you think I must do, turn around and jump out the ring, because the bell starts ringing? [laughter] MUHAMMAD ALI: I'll show you what a real champion is. I'll show you what a real champion is. Take that thing on down. I ain't that heavy. Move it on down, Commissioner. I'll take it all out. COMMISSIONER: 215 pounds. Come on. 215 pounds, you know he's-- ANNOUNCER: 215 pounds. I got to go now. MAN: Muhammad? Are we gonna go? Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Oh! Rumble, young man, rumble! Ah! [bell rings] [music playing] ANNOUNCER: Frazier's not the easy target he used to be. He's bobbing and weaving all the time. And he's dangerous. He just punched a left hook. Muhammad Ali just punched and jab, and a good combination. REFEREE: Break. ANNOUNCER: First clinch of the fight. [music playing] That was a hard left hook at Joe Frazier. [music playing] Frazier is more vulnerable in the first round, and Muhammad Ali knows that. [crowd cheering] Muhammad Ali, shakes his head. And is warned, for holding behind the neck. [music playing] Muhammad Ali has been missing. MUHAMMAD ALI: This is Joe Frazier, fighting me, punches around. See, this is Joe Frazier. He's trying to duck. What he's doing, he's catching them, see. [music playing] ANNOUNCER: And Frazier has gotten wild. He lost his good timing he had earlier, lost the rhythm. [crowd cheering] That was a good one. [crowd cheering] Muhammad Ali withdraws, he's holding on desperately. [music playing] 30 seconds to go in the round, 30 seconds. Muhammad Ali in real trouble. [music playing] Muhammad Ali, right in the ropes. And he almost goes down. [music playing] Muhammad Ali's going-- [music playing] And Frazier gets him to-- Break. ANNOUNCER: --the referee. [music playing] On a point there. [crowd cheering] Hey. MUHAMMAD ALI: Joe Frazier hit me, count four was up. I had never been knocked out, never really beat up. See, now what you can say-- you're going to say about Muhammad Ali, I never took no beating, never beat up. I never had been really knocked out more than any count of 10. [music playing] [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: Five seconds! We'll have an ending here, with the winner. And making him the winner. [bell rings] REPORTER: Muhammad, what about that 3-and-1/2-year layoff? Just filled 15 rounds with joy, hit him three times to his one. Just as strong as he, we were both tired in the end. I think he was a little tireder. Of course, he was enough to get me down like he did, with the beginning of the round, he should have finished me. If he was really strong, and had the strength, but I could see he wasn't. He was missing a lot of hooks. He was exhausted too. But he kept forcing them. But the 3-and-1/2 years, I think did a lot. But I still have enough to get away with things like that with Joe Frazier. I really think the guy's kind of sick in the head, really. [laughter] Because at some point in the fight, he rapped off and said, don't you know I'm God? [laughter] So he-- he keeps saying this. You know what I mean? Every time he'd throw a punch, you know, don't you know I'm God? [laughter] And I got on to some of the punches. And I said, well, God, you gonna get whooped tonight. [laughter] Was there conversation-- Yeah. --during the 14 rounds? Yeah. When we were in round 14, I would say, I'm crazy. I'm bad. He said, I'm crazy too. JOE FRAZIER: Don't you know I'm God? MUHAMMAD ALI: Well, I'm not God. I wouldn't tell you, don't you know I'm God. JOE FRAZIER: Yes, you said it. -I don't know. You heard-- JOE FRAZIER: You said it. You heard something wrong. JOE FRAZIER: Told me you were God. I hit you so hard, you didn't-- No, you weren't that hard. REGGIE JACKSON: Muhammad, during that fight that you lost, you said, you'd kiss his feet. I lied. [laughter] REGGIE JACKSON: You lied? [laughter] JOE FRAZIER: Too. Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. MUHAMMAD ALI: Oh, what worries me now is this belly I got. It just won't come off. usually when I was younger, I could run it and sweat it off. I'm exercising. I'm running. I'm training. And every day I look at my belly, It's the same size. [music playing] [crowd cheering] Ellis'll do what? Boy, if James Ellis dreams he beat me, better wake up and apologize. [laughter] ANNOUNCER: Muhammad Ali sustained attack is beginning to wear Ellis down, here in round 12. Ali, banging home short, accurate punches. Ellis, trying to defend against one of the fastest heavyweights of all time. [music playing] With James "Jimmy" Ellis, a fairly-beaten fighter, as the referee stops the contest! GEORGE FOREMAN: I mean, I was scared of Joe Frazier. Nobody could tell me anything weak about him, because I didn't-- I know there weren't any weaknesses. He hadn't even beat Muhammad Ali at this point. And my scheme, or my part of psychology from that point on, early in my career, I would stare the guy down. I started getting in their face, looking them dead in the eye. If they would drop their face, I knew then I had this edge. But when getting ready to fight Joe Frazier, I had to look him in the eye. But I was hoping he wouldn't look down, because my knees were uncontrollable. I couldn't stop them from shaking. JOE FRAZIER: I used to look at guys like Henry Armstrong, and watch how these guys throw punches, and Sugar Ray Robinson. And see, Henry Armstrong was a guy that never stopped. He-- he'd throw, like, 300 punches in a round in steady movements. So I said, if I could be like that, and I could do that and keep that pressure on him, he'd eventually break. [bell rings] [music playing] This time, I had watched Joe Frazier fight, followed his whole career by being on his under card. I remember seeing him fight Jerry Quarry. And I mean, Jerry Quarry was putting it to Joe Frazier like nothing. And after four or five rounds, Joe Frazier went in front of the camera, looked at his trainer, and said, ooh, as though he liked it. And I kept thinking, I want to become champion, but I hope Joe Frazier die first. ANNOUNCER: Foreman, having a very good round. Joe-- Frazier went down! Taking a mandatory-- it's Foreman, in complete charge of the fight. Frazier's fighting back gamely, but he's having trouble. Here's the countdown, 20 seconds to go. Frazier, down again! [crowd cheering] He's hobbling around, taking the mandatory eight count. The round is almost over. Foreman after him again. Frazier has never taken this kind of punishment. He goes down at the bell. The standard rules. Now he's taking the mandatory eight count at the bell, but he's-- GEORGE FOREMAN: I knew, with that bell ringing, I'm wondering, what am I going to do? He came out, and he threw this famous left hook. And it just barely missed me. And it sounded like a pistol. Shoo! No, like a rifle, a bullet just going past your head. And I knew then that if I didn't hurry up and get that fight over, that I stood not only a chance of losing the match, but really getting myself seriously hurt. [music playing] ANNOUNCER: Frazier is battered in Foreman's corner. Joe's about to go down again. He goes down again. Joe is desperately trying to get to his feet. He's on his feet, taking a mandatory eight count. 45 seconds to go in the round, Joe's been down four times. There goes Joe, down again. Joe, down for the count. Five times, he's been down. Foreman, at him again. It's hard to see how Frazier could win. [music playing] Frazier down six times. That Frazier [inaudible]. He's got to go to his corner. Frazier doesn't know where he is. The fight is over! The fight is over! The winner is George Foreman! George, I got to know about your plans for the future. Will you fight Frazier again? Or will you fight Muhammad Ali? Right now, that was my main goal, was to win the World Heavyweight Championship. You've got it now. I knew I could be beat Ali. In my mind, I told myself I could beat him. If I had not have done it, I would have put on such a good show. or I would have done so much, that I would have been seen and put in a position where I could do more and fight more. My purse would become bigger. ANNOUNCER: See the way he's leaning over there? You can't land a right hand. He just keeps leaning over, away from him. Plus the fact that when you're trying to land that left hand, that right hand-- KEN NORTON: Well, I can tell you, I'm making moves to make him make a move, until I capitalized. I didn't want to hurt anyone. I didn't want to get hurt. I just-- it was competition, one on one in the highest form. ANNOUNCER: --Ali puts the fans on their-- out of their seats in San Diego. ANNOUNCER: This is heating up, a good exchange of right hands. Ali, looking to counter his left jab, with a right hand open. ANNOUNCER: Oh, and it's right to the jaw. The ex-champion, Muhammad Ali. MUHAMMAD ALI: And I broke my jaw in round two. And we went ten more rounds. I didn't know it was broke. I just knew i was in burning pain. So I took my teeth and held my-- kept my teeth closed because it felt better. Little did I know, I was holding my-- I was actually holding the jaw in place. I find out, after the fact, it's broke. If I knew-- if I thought my jaw was broke, I would have stopped. INTERVIEWER: Why? You think I'm a fool? Me failing, a broken jaw, start hitting in my face hard punches, and my jaw already broken, a man hitting on it just might break it more. Man, that's a dumb question. ANNOUNCER: Norton wins! Norton wins-- Ali, in my mind, is the reason that there's so much money involved in sports today. Not only boxing, but football, basketball, it all started with Ali and his gift for gab and his showmanship, and his receiving large purses. Because after he-- before Ali, purses were very minimal. During Ali's time, they grew. After Ali, they just exploded. ANNOUNCER: --the closing seconds of this fight. It's coming to you from Los Angeles, and the near-capacity crowd has really enjoyed it, as we have. Less than 20 seconds now! And Norton, coming back here, pushing the former champion against the ropes, pulling everything he's got to do. ANNOUNCER: He knows he's doing it! He knows he's blown this last round, and he's blown the whole championship, because he gave away too much at the start of this fight. Less than 10 seconds remaining now, and will there not be a knock out. And he must go the distance, 12 rounds, a tremendous finish here, put on by the former champion, Muhammad Ali, as the bell sounds, ending the fight. Oh, a swift decision for Ali, for the former champion of the world. KEN NORTON: I like the man quite a bit. Well, I had-- I had an accident. My wife told me he was probably the third person to the hospital in LA. By the grace of God, I'm still living. Because I should have died. I was going on the freeway, in LA, on the Santa Monica freeway, and went to the top of the hill and something happened, went over the hill. Took about a 35-degree angle, and rolled over the side. And there was one tree. I found it. I had a skull fracture, broke my jaw, broke my leg, blood clots, you name it. I've always been very physical in my life. And to be-- to have waited so long and then all of a sudden, have everything turn, and then you're more or less, a cripple, you know, it's very traumatic. [music playing] MUHAMMAD ALI: I got to get back to my mountaintop retreat! We gonna shock the world again! I guess if you've been around this guy long enough, you know what I mean, somehow you could have a lot of hate in your heart, you know, when that bell rings. But otherwise, you look at him and laugh. There's something wrong with the guy. Oh, the second fight I was more prepared than any of the other fights. I forced the whole fight. And let's say, he did all the holding. He bugged me all night long. I'm glad I didn't have no money on me, because he probably would have take some from me. ANNOUNCER: Ali and Frazier visited our studios while preparing for their fight number two, and to analyze their fight number one. He didn't bring up-- he said-- Well, what the difference? Why'd you think I went to the hospital? Why do you think that I'm leaving? I went to the hospital for 10 minutes-- But why do you think that I'm ignorant? I went to the hospital for 10 minutes-- Why-- why you think I'm ignorant? Man, you know, sit down. Sit down. Sit down, Joe. JOE FRAZIER: Why you think I'm ignorant? MUHAMMAD ALI: Sit down, Joe. JOE FRAZIER: Huh? MUHAMMAD ALI: Sit down, quick. -Why you think I'm ignorant? MUHAMMAD ALI: Sit-- the brothers are here. -You in on this too? -Now, come on. MUHAMMAD ALI: Sit down, quick, Joe! ANNOUNCER: Well, we're having a scene, as you can see. It's hard to tell whether it's clowning or for real, between the two fighters. This kind of thing has been going on all along, in terms of promotion of the fight. And this time it seems to be for real, because John Frazier is really angry. I think that Ali is probably clowning. [bell rings] ANNOUNCER: Joe is hurt! Joe Frazier, in trouble, here in round two! Here, Referee, Tony Perez, unbelievably tells the fighters-- And some people think maybe the referee and somebody had some money bet on Frazier, and did that on purpose, and were thinking another round. And that's just-- ANNOUNCER: Ali, spurring it on, here at the end of round two. This is the 12th and final round. Frazier, looking for that knock out, here in round 12. Joe is going all out. Frazier, tearing in there with dynamite punches. [crowd cheering] A punishing left to the head, by Joe Frazier. [crowd cheering] Both men, pulling out all the stops, here in the 12th round. [bell rings] And there is the end of this sensational fight. Muhammad Ali, with a unanimous decisions in one of the great heavyweight fights of all time. For me, it wasn't a thing where I had to win. It was just a challenge for me to go in and take care of business and come out without getting hurt. There were three or four of my-- three or four of my fights that I hit the man and I paralyzed him right there with a good shot. And I saw that he was he was gone, he couldn't do anything else. So I walked away. Kenny Norton was a fearsome specimen to watch. He was a throwback to some of the old gladiators. So this man was really a-- you didn't want to-- I was forced to fight the number one contender. And that way I made up-- of course, I was matched with Kenny Norton. I didn't want that match. [laughter] [bell rings] [music playing] ANNOUNCER: Round two, [inaudible], the Heavyweight Championship of the World. Oh, a good-- good right hand, a left-hand side to the face from Norton. Norton, is a bit stunned, as Foreman is taking off. And it looks like Norton has really been staggered, as he went up against the ropes. The referee is giving this a count. Yes! He'll have to take the eight count. OK, it's 17, and here we go! And Norton's just banging on the second round-- Norton goes down again! A left hand on the side of the head. Norton goes back. He'll have to take another eight count. No, he didn't. He's [inaudible]. A right upper cut! A left hook! And all [inaudible]. He's up to five! And [inaudible]! But it looks like it may be all over. And it is all over! George Foreman retains the Heavyweight Championship. MUHAMMAD ALI: He hit Ken Norton just like he do all his opponents, caught him early. I mean, he is hard. But if a man can stay out of the way for five rounds, stick him, move, stay out of range, be in good shape, he'll retire George Foreman. This man depends on getting this man in the first one or two rounds. If he don't do that, he's frustrated. Stick him with left jabs and right crosses, tie him up and box him, and you will retire him. Now, Ali-- I know this man is going to whoop George Foreman, and I'm going to whoop him, of all places, in Africa, in the Congo, where the Lamumba Boys are. Now, Ali, now that you have your cool about you, and you're calmed down at this point, I want you to answer this question-- how could that man go 24 rounds with you and only two with the Heavyweight Champion of the World? Because George Foreman is not as good of a fighter, scientific, as I am. But I admit, he's stronger, and he hit harder. I'm not a hard puncher. I'm not known for being a hard puncher. I fought many men, like Floyd Patterson, Zora Folley, George Chuvalo, who were stronger than I am. Many I couldn't knock out, Sonny Liston. But I will tell you this, boxing ability, speed, whooping him on points for the distance, if necessary, then I'll whoop him. Well, a fight in your home territory, you couldn't be any happier, the way this is coming up in September. Why would you call Africa my home territory? You've been telling me that for 10 years. That's right. And if you come over there, talking like that, we'll cook you. George, tell me about the fight that you had with Kenny Norton. GEORGE FOREMAN: I really didn't want that fight. But I was put in a position where I had to take it, by the governing bodies. And I didn't want to fight Norton. But he was advised-- I figured, because he is so good-- and the word go around that George Foreman keeps his head straight up-- that he would try for a knock out. I think if the fight had gone fives rounds, he could have whipped me too. But he started throwing big hooks early. And we got into an exchange, and I got the better of him. And I kept thinking, I remember-- I knocked him down. I said, I better get him while he's down too. I even get him then. [laughter] I didn't want him to get up. KEN NORTON: Old-- old fart. [laughter] GEORGE FOREMAN: I didn't want him to get up. Because I knew if this guy get warmed up, this fight would never end. Did you try to go blow for blow? I was going to go out acting like I was going to go toe to toe, make him load it up, back off, and counter. REGGIE JACKSON: Mhm? And use my hook. But as you saw in the fight-- REGGIE JACKSON: When he loaded up-- --I backed up. And I kept backing, and kept backing. And I stumbled. [laughter] GEORGE FOREMAN: Of course, I had knocked out Joe Frazier and beat him conventionally, of course. Then I'd knocked out Kenny Norton, who was-- I figured-- the greatest physical specimen one could ever look at. And I was kind of afraid of Kenny Norton, but I did win the boxing match. I was able to eliminate guys pretty easily who had really given Muhammad Ali a whooping. So people were telling me, George, be careful. Don't kill Muhammad. He's old. Take it easy. The-- the adjectives used in the press has been beautiful. The more strong man they make this guy, the better I like it. 'Cause my fighter has got plenty to shoot for now. He's the underdog twice, going to shock the world and become the Heavyweight champ of the world again. I've always said, he's the greatest heavyweight of all time. He has to lick Foreman to make the press admit this. I've been working four months for this fight. My weight today is 214 pounds. That's fight weight. Already I'm way ahead of schedule. My timing, my accuracy, my reach'll be an inch-and-a-half longer. The man is slower. The man is flat footed! The man don't stand a chance! The stage has been set! This man is a poser! Annihilate me-- 10 years from Sonny Liston, I was supposed to be-- get it that time. I think it'd be fitting that I go out a boxer, just like I came in, shocking the world by beating a big bad ugly monster that nobody could beat. I got into Africa 15 days prior to the boxing match. 10 days prior to the boxing match, I suffered a cut. And they wouldn't let me out of Africa. I found out quickly that all the airlines flying in and out were controlled by the people and the President of Zaire, or whatever, and George Foreman could not leave town. [bell rings] [music playing] ANNOUNCER: One minute left in round number one. The Heavyweight Championship between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, live via satellite, direct from Zaire, Africa. That punch did no damage.that one did. Two, one on right hand, taken on the side of the head of Muhammad Ali. Ali, continues to try to tie his man up. Back late, separates them. Violent hand, vicious hook. There's a real strong right here just underneath the heart. And Muhammad Ali is taking some the punch now, about 25 seconds left in the round. Ali, faced left goes with the great right hand. That right-hand lead has George Foreman slightly confused. What a great left jab pulled by Foreman! And Foreman. Ali takes it back! He's a-- what a tremendous, tremendous hit in round number one, a hook to the body of Muhammad Ali. Zach Clayton, the referee, separates them. About eight seconds left in the round. Round one, Foreman and Ali, ending round one. MUHAMMAD ALI: If there are several rounds of this I'll be finished. So I realized that, so I stopped and let him run his energy while I lay on the ropes, doing the gimmick called the Rope-a-dope. ANNOUNCER: Foreman, setting him up against the ropes. Ali-- fast punches by Ali! Ali, definitely going with the hands in this fight. There's the jab. Ali Bomaye! And here's Ali, killing him with his [inaudible]. [music playing] Ali, making the hook. But that's a punch that is as it gets. Sticking it to the head of Muhammad Ali. But that punch was good. [crowd cheering] GEORGE FOREMAN: I hit him with a good shot. You know what he told me? Is that all you got in you? ANNOUNCER: --in the ear of of Foreman. Why he continued to taunt him-- Ali is super confident. Foreman looks unusually-- oh, with his hands. What a hit. All of a sudden, he opens up, four punches downstairs on Ali. Ali, of course, has protection around that area. He'll get hit tonight, Ali showing the ability to punch in the side against George Foreman. Now the fighters move across the ring. A right-hand lead by Foreman this time, another right hand. A good right hand, hanging on the left side of the cheek of the jaw of Muhammad Ali. The points are so far for George Foreman. I don't know if it started, but it did spin the head around of Muhammad Ali. I'd have to say the heaviest punch so far was definitely planted by Foreman in that exchange. Ali, trying to hang on. Might have been just done by that blow with his right hand. Eye on the gold, is Ali. Ali continues to start, continues to go. 30 seconds left in round number three. Foreman, looking for his opening to unload that left hand, underneath the heart of Ali, and dropped the right. There he goes with the right. But it just didn't land that time. Very even fight. 10 seconds left now, in round three. Ali, showing his-- the hands, it's left, right, left. He's hitting Foreman! Foreman, again. GEORGE FOREMAN: I remember hitting him so hard in his chest. And not only did it hurt him, it sort of took his-- dehumanized him. He looked at me as if to say, I'm not going to take that from you. And he came after me. He remembered the pain. And then he said, forget it. He covered up. A couple of my trainers, get off the ropes. Get off the ropes. Move, move. So I told them I'm going to fight my way. I'm gonna do it my way and shut up. [music playing] ANNOUNCER: Ali, hanging on, getting away with it. Getting away with it, the left hand taken to the side. And Ali gets the left hook again. I went to finish him off. Two rounds, I said, I'm going. I don't care about the five, six rounds. I'm gonna knock him out in two rounds. Third round, he was still there. I said, well who cares? I'm not going to pace myself. I'm going to knock him out. Finally, after five or six rounds, I was burnt out. This experienced great athlete withstood all of this pain-- because I hit him with some of the hardest shots I'd ever delivered on a man. It would knock him back and out. He would literally stand there and wake up again. ANNOUNCER: Very even fight. Ali, a sneaky right hand. Another sneaky right hand. This time he works over the floor with Foreman. There's Ali! [crowd cheering] GEORGE FOREMAN: I burned myself out and he caught me with a right hand just as I was walking and following him without any respect, just trying to get one shot in. Tricked me, moved off the rope with this lightning speed that he was not supposed to have at this age. One-two combination, caught me right on the chin. I said, I can't believe it. I hit the floor. Actually, I hit the floor again with my fist. I waited for my corner to tell me to get up. A boxer is not supposed to get up. He's supposed to wait until his corner say, get up. My manager told me to get up. He counted for me. When I jumped up, the fight was over. I had lost the Heavyweight Championship of the World to Muhammad Ali. And there he was, with his hands raised. And I had to eat crow feet. [music playing] ANNOUNCER: Ali has done it! The great man has done it! [music playing] MUHAMMAD ALI: So everybody stop talking now. Attention-- I told you, all of my critics, I told you all that I was the greatest of all time when I beat Sonny Liston! I told you today I'm still the greatest of all time! Never again, defeat me! Never again, say that I'm going to be defeated. Never again make me the underdog until I'm about 50 years old. Then you might get me. I told you, I'm the real champion! I told you, I'm the champion of the world! All of you bow! All of my critics crawl! All of you suckers who write "The Ring" Magazine! All of you suckers bow! All you who criticize Muhammad Ali, I want you to bow. Crawl! Crawl! Cause I'm back! Thought I was gone, thought I was old, washed up, thought I couldn't talk no more, thought I was through, then tell the whole world I'm back. And maybe the first black man to go to the moon. --Jimmy the Greek, come to Muhammad Ali. REGGIE JACKSON: Do you think, to this day, that the ropes were made loose that night on purpose? GEORGE FOREMAN: Everybody need an excuse. I couldn't live with myself without an excuse. So I blamed it on the rope. I blamed it on everything. [laughter] That devastated me. I was undefeated. I never had lost a boxing match. REGGIE JACKSON: You had a difficult time with him? And so I couldn't adjust to that. So you give me an excuse, I was picking them out of the air. REGGIE JACKSON: Really? Oh yeah. my shoes were too big. Anything. MUHAMMAD ALI: People want to see me and Joe Frazier! They still think Joe Frazier can beat me! And I got his conscience right here, to keep me on guard. See? See? Here's the way he looks when you hit him. [laughter] Come on, gorilla, this is a thrilla! REGGIE JACKSON: I think a lot of people thought-- and myself included-- that you didn't like it. And you used-- No, I didn't like it at all. REGGIE JACKSON: --you used it to get yourself fired up to-- MUHAMMAD ALI: You trying to start something? REGGIE JACKSON: No. [laughter] No, no. I'm just asking the question. No, no, I really didn't like it because number one, I know the fact that it wasn't the base of trying to get in with people-- let's say, butts in the seats, where we all had gangs in. I know that he was-- was out to get me and out to hurt me more than anything else. The words was-- were more hurting to me than, let's say, the punches. In the pre-fight commentary? That's right. The punches enough for me, you know? What were some of the things that bothered you? He called me a Tom. I know-- never know what Tom was. You know, I thought it was a guy that peeped through windows or something. You know? And I never peeped up no windows. [laughter] MUHAMMAD ALI: That's peeping Toms. REGGIE JACKSON: That's peeping Toms. You said that. You said that. you called me a Tom. I thought it was peeping Tom. ANNOUNCER: To the winner of our main event will go this handsome trophy, donated by-- [crowd cheering] MUHAMMAD ALI: People tell me-- and I think the boxers thought this also-- admit that the Frazier fight in Philippines was about the best-- I mean, action in round 1 and round 13, every minute, moving and punching. [bell rings] ANNOUNCER: Two minutes left in the round. [crowd cheering] But it was the same thing again. I was behind in that particular fight. INTERVIEWER: You were? I was. In points, I was behind in that fight. You know? INTERVIEWER: Right. And it was, like, maybe 125 or 130 degrees in that ring, or more. ANNOUNCER: Ali, warned-- Ali, warned by the referee for grabbing around the neck. And it's not really any disrespect after him, but I feel comfortable about it because we had three fights. And you look back now on the films today, and you watch him, and you know who won them all. [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: 10 seconds! [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: Frazier looks awful tired. There's puffs around both eyes now. [crowd cheering] [bell rings] Frazier is hurt! [crowd cheering] Frazier's badly hurt. [crowd cheering] JOE FRAZIER: There was just as many-- there were just as many blacks having these up close as white. You know, he didn't ignore it, because he didn't-- he didn't believe in, well, you are-- let's say, white or black. He was more into his religion. That's what it was, I think. If I wasn't a Muslim, you wouldn't have known. It was as bad as being white. You know what I mean? [crowd cheering] [bell rings] ANNOUNCER: Round! Frazier, was within a punch or two of going down! It's all over. [crowd cheering] I bet two-to-one for you. Although you don't need the money. MUHAMMAD ALI: Joe Frazier still wants to beat me today. Oh, that might be good, Joe. If you're watching this, after I come by for Kong, your son, I'll come back for you. So I'm not going to say nothing bad about Joe Frazier. Joe Frazier, I love you. We're brothers. You're my man, and I ain't going to let this man start another fight. [laughter] That's always someone-- there's always some-- always some white men trying to get two brothers to fight. And I ain't going to let these white men get me in trouble. [laughter] ANNOUNCER: And here comes Joe Frazier, a man who has brought nothing but decency and integrity, and indefatigable effort to his trade. And look what he's done! Look what Joe Frazier has done! He's shaved his head! [crowd cheering] Frazier, trying to fight back. Foreman, dominant. Round five! Foreman, got him. Good combo. And again, you saw that. Frazier's hurt! Frazier's hurt again! One right hurt Frazier. Frazier-- Frazier's down. Frazier is down from a right, a mandatory eight count. George Foreman, looking revived tonight. Frazier, getting the left. Frazier, getting the right. Frazier, taking it from George Foreman. Foreman, not-- Foreman again, with the right. Second knock down in the round. One more knock down, this fight is over. REFEREE: Five! ANNOUNCER: George Foreman, struggling to-- REFEREE: Six! Seven! Eight! ANNOUNCER: Joe Frazier, struggling to his feet. George Foreman, poised in the neutral corner. Look at him, in total command now. And-- and-- Harold Valen says the fight is over! George Foreman wins in the fifth round, by a technical knock out. GEORGE FOREMAN: Over 10 years ago I stopped boxing. At an age where everybody said, hey you shouldn't do it, I became a full-time evangelist. And I would read articles about George Foreman is a coward. He's scared. He's trying to make up am excuse. He's got a crutch. He's a coward. And now he's using the crutch as the Bible. The Bible is a crutch. I had to eat all that up. And I did eat it for 10 years. And I took on that challenge and was a full-time preacher and minister and took care of churches, and built them, travelled around the world giving my testimony, when a lot of people looked at me oddly. That was the true challenge. The true challenge was not the staring Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali down, but picking up a bible and going around the country, telling people that God loves you. I feel good. How I Look? I feel good. And when I walk, I walk about 12 miles in the morning, from here to [inaudible], about 12 miles. And some days I go to the gymnasium and work out 12, 13 rounds on the bag, jump rope. I don't no physical weakness or sickness. They say I have Parkinson's syndrome. But I don't shake. And people with Parkinson's-- that's what I supposed to-- and sometimes slurred speech. And I'm believing that I have something, though it's nothing critical. [laughter] [laughter] That's the only red I'm gonna see. MAN: I feel that um-- my main asset is going to be given by Ali, because of the fact that-- as I've stated before-- that he's going to stand there more now. he said he's not going to move as much. And he's going to walk to me more. So therefore, his head is going to be my main asset. [laughter] [bell rings] ANNOUNCER: On his toes! Norton still doesn't know how to solve the style! Norton's got to trap him on the ropes. Now grabs him-- I won one fight. And the second fight, he won by decision. Correct? Could have went either way. But the third fight, at Yankee Stadium, I thought I won. ANNOUNCER: --sliding along and punching all the time he's sliding, 55 seconds to go. Ali's won at least 2/3 of this round. Can he keep it up? Can Norton do something spectacular? The fight, more or less, was the turning point in Ali's career. If he had lost, it would have taken a lot out of the sport. So I wasn't just battling the man. It was the game. ANNOUNCER: --maybe out of Norton's grasp! Oh, he threw a hay maker but missed! Ali comes back with a flurry. Most not landing, but big-- another big right hand! Another big right hand by Norton! All he did was catch air with those right hands. He's desperate. He knows he's blowing the title. Another right hand! And that one connects! And he misses with a left and almost falls down, as Ali pushes him off of it yet! A good right hand catches Ali, as the crowd comes to its feet with less than 10 seconds. Ali, holding on. Norton is desperate! Six seconds, five-- the bell is about to ring to end this fight at Yankee Stadium. [bell rings] And we'll be back with the decision! Oh, Norton's screaming at him. [crowd cheering] Muhammad Ali, still Heavyweight Champion of the World. And in his corner, Norton is crushed! MUHAMMAD ALI: He had no name, no prestige, no threat. So I said, well, I'll beat this guy. So I didn't really train like I should. [bell rings] ANNOUNCER: Tremendous action by the champion here! Where has he been for the previous 14 rounds? We are at the 40 seconds. Now the desperation left, missed by the challenger. Ali, onward, but still pursuing [inaudible], praying that perhaps one of these punches will connect and the gallant challenger, Leon Spinks, will fall. 24, 23 seconds. ANNOUNCER: Spinks, dead tired. Dead tired, it looks like he was out, but he came right back. And now it's Ali who's showing the signs of where it is. He didn't-- that's really a shuffle forward. Now it's 13 seconds. Now, Leon, having him against the rope is throwing everything he can. It's eight seconds away or he's luck-- he's just here with Ali! Ali looks like he's in trouble! He's leaning against the ropes. It's two seconds. It's one, and that's the bell! [bell rings] A tremendous right hand. Look at Ali stagger back! MUHAMMAD ALI: People thought I would throw the fight-- some do-- with Spinks the first time, because I lost. I lost and came back and beat him to win the title three times. They think that was a setup, and it wasn't. If it was, I wouldn't have brought it up. [bell rings] ANNOUNCER: He's a fighter has been really hurt. There are no such-- and a great fight! With less than a minute, by Ali, but Spinks, coming back, going after the former champion, probably all in vain. 30 seconds to go. And unless Leon Spinks has got some super-human effort in him, he'll have to kiss his crown goodbye. Well, this right hand by Spinks, the old butterfly has done it again. Well, Bobby, there it is. 11 seconds. ANNOUNCER: 11 seconds. ANNOUNCER: There'll be no knock out. That's for sure. There never was going to be one. Eight, seven-- and that's about it, folks! [bell rings] He's done it! Ali is the World Heavyweight Champion for the third time! [music playing] [music playing] LARRY HOLMES: I fought Kenny in 1978. I was in good shape, but I had a problem. I had one arm. I pulled a muscle six days before the flight. And I didn't really want anyone to know it. And so I just did row work, and go in the gym and shadow box. And when it was Kenny Norton's time to work out, I'd go over and try to take his concentration away from him. Because I wanted to take away from the rumors that were going around, with me hurting my arm or something or other. [bell rings] ANNOUNCER: Really now, this is what he has to do. LARRY HOLMES: It meant something to me when I fought those guys. It meant something to me when I went in the ring with Kenny Norton and Muhammad Ali, and it was inspired by Joe Frazier. And when I walked into the room and George Foreman says, Larry Holmes, you know, it means something. ANNOUNCER: It's is a big round for Kenny Norton, I'm afraid. In the waning moments now, of the round-- I never was serious enough about boxing. I never really put myself into it to the point where it was that or nothing. ANNOUNCER: This has been a great boxing show, both fighters courageous, as Holmes comes back, scores a good shot. He's getting into trouble! Yes! he's going to follow up. Uppercut scores. Running out of time. [bell rings] And that's it! It's all over! Larry Holmes has done it! We have a new Heavyweight Champion! Well, I knew that I could beat Muhammad years before I fought him, a couple years before I fought him. Because I was his sparring partner. And being his sparring partner, I got the opportunity to watch him, to learn from him, and to be around him a great deal. [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: In the blue corner, the challenger, the three-time Heavyweight Champion of the World, Muhammad Ali. [crowd cheering] Fighting out of Easton, Pennsylvania, he is going for a record, eight-straight KO in the Heavyweight title defense. He is the WBC Heavyweight Champion of the World, Larry "The Easton Assassin" Holmes. [bell rings] ANNOUNCER: Whether it'll-- Ali can pressure Holmes early enough to get to him to cause him troubel-- he wants to prove he's got it over Ali. LARRY HOLMES: To me, he was a legend. He was a legend. He's still a legend. And you don't want to fight anybody like that, especially guys who helped you. ANNOUNCER: --yet. But Ali hasn't thrown any punches yet either. The timing was awful. You saw the punches, couldn't take it. They tell me that's old age, when you see it and you can't take it, see it coming and can't get away. That was age. [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: I think he popped him pretty good. [crowd cheering] I'm pleased that he's throwing that right. Coming into the closing seconds now, in round one. [bell rings] LARRY HOLMES: I didn't have no charisma, they will say. They didn't want me to have charisma. I had charisma but in my own way. I had the charisma-- I didn't want to go out and say, I am the greatest! See, Muhammad did that. That was his thing. And if I did that, they would say, you're still in the line from Muhammad Ali. And if I say, Muhammad Ali float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. But don't forget he met Larry. They would say, now you're writing poems, trying to be like Muhammad Ali. So you know, everything that I said and done, I was on the border. I was right on the edge. I could fall right off. And so therefore, I tried to stay away from the press as much as I could. Because any little thing that I said would hurt me. And I took the name Muhammad Ali, and people heard the name, Muhammad Ali, in America and chanted it, all the Egyptians says, Muhammad Ali's Muslim. All the Arabians, Indonesians, Pakistan, Africa, in Libya, all through Afghanistan, Morocco, Pakistan, they all say, Muhammad Ali, a Muslim, a world champ, that's the first time. That made me famous. [crowd yelling] ANNOUNCER: I think he's survived. I only started a fair fight. I trained too horrible to fight. I didn't make any excuse. I should have did better. I was more worried about my weight than really conditioning. [crowd cheering] ANNOUNCER: Larry just continues to tee off, the whole story of this fight. And Holmes draws punches, and Ali, doing nothing, just taking shots. MUHAMMAD ALI: And he didn't sweat, and something was wrong. MAN: Come on, that's it! Dig in! Dig in! Bring it up, big Jack! Go go! ANNOUNCER: He's taking his dues. But it's the time now-- ANNOUNCER: He could lay down as soon as he find out that his arms weren't working. He's going to-- MAN: Left hook! Left hook! Left hook! [bell rings] ANNOUNCER: Title is one thing. It's not like losing a job or losing your life or losing your wife. MAN: --you! No! Stop hitting him! No! MUHAMMAD ALI: One more! ANNOUNCER: He handled it with dignity. REFEREE: No! -Check him out. The whole game's over! I'm the chief's second. They stopped the fight! [music playing] The champion, the people's champion that I wanted to be while I was fighting, the guy who gave opportunities to fighters that wouldn't have got opportunities, a fighter who accomplished and set examples, the guy who, like, walked the road that he wanted to walk. GEORGE FOREMAN: I want them to have the record straight, that I was a good boxer, and that I did fight some of the top contenders, and that I did fight for the Championship of the World and won it fair and square. If I can be remembered and have my name called in the same fashion as, like I said, Jack Dempsey, Muhammad Ali, and Joe Frazier, I'll be a happy man. I'll be pretty contented with that. I don't want to be remembered as the greatest-- the greatest at all. I just want to be remembered as a good boxer.
