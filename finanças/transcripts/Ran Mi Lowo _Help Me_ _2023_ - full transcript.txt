[theme music] [clicks, whirring] [indistinct radio chatter] [♪] [♪] [ominous music] [in Yoruba] Hey! [giggles] You got scared. -Deola, how are you? -I'm okay. Why didn't you go to school today? I'm not going back to school. Huh? I'm not going back to school. You're not going back to school? Ah-ah. What happened? Why would you say you're not going back to school? Nothing happened, nothing happened. Deola, talk to me. I'm your friend. You just said you're not going back to school, just like that. And you say nothing happened. -Deola, talk to me. -I'm okay. I'm okay. Nothing happened. I'm okay. [tsks] You're kidding. -[girl] Yemisi. -[in English] Later. [in Yoruba and English] Let her be. She thinks she's better than us. [students chattering] [girl #2 in Yoruba] What I heard was she was raped. [girl #3 grunts] Look, if nothing is done quickly about this issue, you and I could be next. Ah-ah, God forbid. Hmm. But who could this person be? Who could be responsible for this? [grunts] [tsks] Look, only God can protect us in this school. Amen. -[dramatic music] -[singers vocalizing] [no audible dialogue] Hey! [shouting indistinctly] [in English] You know that our pass rate has moved up from 69% to 73%. I think that deserves a round of applause. It's a-- it's a lot of hard work. [in Yoruba] It's a lot of hard work. [in English and Yoruba] You know, you may think that has no meaning. -[in English] Four percent is a lot. -Mm. And this improvement came about because our students became more interested in mathematics. A 20% increase. See me after this meeting. [in Yoruba] See me after this meeting. [in English] We need to come together and strategize. [in Yoruba and English] Let us know what we can do for us to get to that 80%. [in English] And then we'll become the best school in the states. So think about this. My office is open to you all for suggestions. Okay, Mr. Bode. I think before we register any of the students for WAEC this year... [in Yoruba] let's have them take mock tests. [in English] So any student that fails any subject shouldn't be allowed to register for WAEC. It's just a suggestion. I like it. Thank you, Ma. -[knocking at door] -[in English] Come in. [door opens] Hello. Please. Sit. I just want to say a big thank you for the things you do for our students. That's the least that I could do to help the future leaders of our community. Well, come on. Thank you for your kindness since I've been here. [in Yoruba] We should be the one thanking you. [in English] You could have chosen to be with an IT firm, but instead you've chose us. Thank you, Ma. [in Yoruba] Come on, what's wrong with you? I have told you whenever we are together alone. [in English] Not all this Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma. [in Yoruba] Mmm? What's wrong with you? [in English] Thank you, Mrs. Adeniji. [in Yoruba] Mrs.? What's wrong with this boy? [laughing, tsks] [in English] Call me Lolade. Thank you, Lolade. [man in English] Stay away from drugs. Now, I don't care who gives you the drugs or who has introduced you to the drugs. Simply stay away from drugs. Drugs are not good for your physical and mental health. You don't let anyone influence you into taking drugs, into doing drugs. Some of you go into... -[in Yoruba] What happened? -Shade is in the hospital. They said she's acting like a crackhead. They said she uses hard drugs. [Gbemisola] Let's hear him. [in English] ...because drugs are not good for your health. Did you hear me? [ominous music] [background chatter] -[knocking at door] -[Lolade in English] Come in. -Good afternoon, Ma. -Yes. Uh... [stammering] Yes? [in Yoruba] I don't think Shade used hard drugs, Ma. What do you mean by that? If Shade didn't use hard drugs, why is she acting like a crackhead? I don't know, but... but I'm certain that she didn't use hard drugs, Ma. She didn't use hard drugs. Yes. Fine. -My child. -Ma. I know Shade is your close friend. And I know her current state makes you unhappy. But I want you to know that she will be fine. Don't cry. Stop crying. It's okay, don't cry again. Huh? Don't cry. She will get well, sooner or later. She will be back in our school. You hear? Sorry. Thank you, my child. -Mm? Don't cry anymore. -[sniffles] Now get up, get up, and go to your classroom. Thank you, Ma. -[sighs] -[door opens] [in Yoruba] Thank God, I'm glad I didn't say "yes" to that boy. This is how he could have given me drugs to abuse too. Mm. Did you turn him down? Or was he the one who dumped you and told you to go away? Hey, whether I say "yes" to him or not, it's all the same. -[girls agree] -I was not interest in him. Otherwise I would have snatched him away from that girl a long time ago. I'm Sholi, baby. I don't think Shade used hard drugs, though. I have a feeling that something else is making her behave that way. -[scoffs] -It's not hard drugs. So, our mother, if she didn't use hard drugs, what happened to her? -I don't know. -See, she has nothing to say. You'd just open your flat mouth to say "pa, pa, pa, pa, pa." "Cho, cho, cho, cho" everywhere. Not minding your business. Eh? It was you who said you want to become an investigative journalist. You want this and that. Eh? All the information you bring to us, we don't even know where you get it from. -I'm confused too. -[laughs, claps] Mother, now that you've said she didn't use hard drugs, go do a better investigation thoroughly and come back to tell us what happened and how she became a crackhead, Madam Investigative Journalist. -[girls snickering] -Come on, that was too much. Look at how she is-- "cho, cho, cho, cho." Parrot, is she the only one in this school? My friend, that's right. You're all hypocrites. Hypocrites. [mysterious music] [Bode in English] If I call your name, you stand up. Open your exercise book and pass it to your desk partner to call what you scored, okay? [students] Yes, sir. [Bode] Obafemi. Nine. [Bode] Shola. Sir. Seven. Gbemisola. I said you should pass the book. -Two. -[students laugh] [Bode] Two? Hmm? Two over ten. What happened? -Didn't you get any of the questions? -No, Uncle. I am not in class when you teach it. [students laugh] Just look at yourself. And you're expected to write WAEC in a few months. Wait, I'm sure you know English language is a very compulsory subject to pass. Huh? And you're here scoring two over ten? Well, thank God for the new screening procedures. We are going to be weeding out people like you because we can't have you soil the name of this prestigious institution. And you... what did you score? Mm-mm! Open it yourself. What's your score? Three. [students groan] [scoffs] Three. -Gbenga. -Sir. Obafemi. -What did you score? -Seven. -And you? -Nine. Instead of you looking for someone who scored seven or nine to sit with, you are here sitting with someone who scored three? You're an average of the five people you spend most of your time with. [exhales] But see, let me tell you this. Success rubs off. Likewise failure. Okay? [Gbemisola in Yoruba] He called me a failure! Me, Gbemisola! He treated me like an idiot in front of everyone. And they laughed at me. Ah! I must. I must pass the upcoming English exam. And then we'll see who the biggest dummy is between me and him. It's okay. -It's okay. -I have heard. -We'll find a solution. -It's fine, I have heard. [in Yoruba] I've fixed it. It should work properly now. Wow. -What did you do to it? -[man] Leave that for the expert. Aw, you won't tell me? [laughs] [in English] Thank you so much, Tunde. Thank you. I appreciate it. [in Yoruba] Look, if I had half of the IT skills you had... [laughs] I wouldn't be working here. You should be working for EFCC. You should be helping them hack different gadgets. And you should help them hack bank accounts of dirty politicians embezzling the country's money. [laughs] Look, there's one thing I want you to help me hack. My wife's phone. [in English] I suspect she's cheating. [in Yoruba] You know she should be the one asking for that. [laughing] You're not serious. Ha! I think this new policy we made for the students helped them a lot. They really impressed me with their last test. They eat it all up like pepper. [coughing] [in Yoruba] Wait, should I prepare food and save it for you? You can prepare it. But if you feel you can finish it, go ahead and finish it. -It's not a problem. -Mm-hmm. Even if I'm asleep, you can wake me up anytime so that I can serve you. I'll prepare the food. -I heard you. -I have missed you. I have missed you too. Thank you. Bye. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] [in Yoruba] You guys have finished everything. -I didn't think you'd want it. -Eh? Bro, sit down and ask for what you want. What did I miss? Look, guys, I want Abike to come serve me herself. Because all these girls with tiny legs, they don't know how to entertain customers. Let me go order what I want. Look, don't forget to ask for home delivery. What you just said, I'm the one who is meant to say that to you. Fine, I know you have a girl that you love, but... Kongi na bastard, oh Body no be firewood, oh Hardman, Hardman, Hardman. It will tell on your body. Extreme horniness will just kill you. You better go find a small girl, 18-plus to be smashing. You better find solutions to your problems. I didn't say you should rape her. You should seek her consent. [cackling] -Look, go place your order. -I'll be back. But, you see, some of us only eat from one source. Eh, I have 20 sources, right. -You're not serious. -[Dayo] Abike! This guy, he's not serious. [in English] I don't understand. [Dayo laughs] Abike, baby, baby, baby! -[in Yoruba] How are you? -Baby, are you okay? -Mmm... -I have really missed you. -Eh-heh. -Eh-heh. Look, I have been really busy. And also, my husband, I don't know what happened to him. He is clinging to me and not giving me space to breathe. -He should calm down. -[scoffs] So, when are we going to see each other? Didn't you hear what I just said? I said there's a lot work to do here. Make time for me too. I have missed you. Okay, Thursday. -The day after tomorrow? -No! -Thursday next week. -That's too long, now. -You're horny -That's too long. -Eh. -Hmm? All right, I'll be patient. But before I go, give me a kiss. No, my husband will hear about it. Your husband? Your husband is traveling. What is wrong with you? He's got eyes and ears around me. I don't know how he hears all the things I hear. There's nobody here right now. Come on, give me a kiss, just one. [giggles] Thank you, dear. -Yah! -What do you want to eat? Help me make pepper soup. I want a big fish. Ah-ah. You should already know. Come on, now. Come on, now. -[laughing] -Ah! Look at this beautiful woman! Thank you. [chuckles] [Bode in English] I'm sure we all know we are getting closer to your mock examinations, right? -[students] Yes, sir. -Good. My door is open to anyone who does not understand any topic. -Okay? -[students] Yes, sir. Or anyone who needs further explanation on anything. And I'm sure you know it is not my wish to be hard on anyone, right? -[students] Yes, sir. -[Bode] Good. But I have the responsibility of shaping you into becoming a better leader. Mind you, it is not all about passing your examination, but what you make with the character and knowledge you build from here. -Okay? -[students] Yes, sir. -[Bode] Shade, how are you? -I don't know. So nice to have you back. Make sure you see me in my office after this class, okay? Yes, and also the form I asked you all to fill last week, I need it now. I need to submit to the school administration unfailingly today. -Yes, now. Yes. -[Bode] Submit your form and go for break. Now, please. How are you? Make sure you prepare for your exams. If you need anything, come to my office. My door is open to anyone. Read your books. Thank you. Thank you. -How are you? -I'm fine. All right. [in Yoruba] Aw, Shade, I'm so happy to see you. Are you okay? Don't pay attention to him. [sighs] Shade, look. In case you need to talk to anybody, you can talk to me, you hear? I'm here for you anytime. And I'm thinking maybe some subjects you've missed and classes we've done, maybe I should put you through. Shade, I'm so happy to see you. [footsteps approaching] [in English] Ah-ah, Gbemisola. -Sha. -How are you? Fine, Sha. Uh, we want come your office... We-- we... [in Yoruba] Eh, Gbemisola, speak Yoruba. -Okay, Sha. -Mmm. Me and my friends want to come to your office. There is something we don't understand, and we want you to explain it to us, Sha. [in English] Mm, uh, okay. All right. Um, you know what? Can we do after class tomorrow? [in Yoruba] Mmm. And you should come alone. Okay, Sha. So, for your friends, if they don't understand any topic, they should tell me themselves. [in English] Is that okay? -See you tomorrow, then. -Yes, Sha. -All right. -Thank you. [indistinct chatter] [upbeat music] [in Yoruba] Ha! Bukky, Bukky. You're the one I'm seeing without getting a visa. Ah! Do you know how long I have been praying to get just one chance, just one chance to meet and talk to you? Bukky, look, I like you, I really do. I want us to be... [sucking noises] Mm-hmm. And you're sure you don't have another girl? Eh? Me? It's not like you just want to use me like the others. Me? I don't have anyone else! I don't have anybody. Look, let me tell you, if I had met you, if I had met you before I met my girlfriend, it is you I'd be with. How would I be with her? It would have been you. Ha, look, if you tell me now and say "let's go," with immediate effect, I'd break up with my girlfriend. -Eh... -Yes! Please come see me this weekend. Please, please, please. Ah-ah. Now, see how I look? You want me to come see you this weekend? Look at my hair now. I need to fix my hair. I have to fix my hair. I have to buy sexy undies, sexy undies I'd wear to see you. You are right. I also like to see when a woman gets her hair done, like patewo. Eh. Or a different hairstyle called "face the car," but you'd be facing me. You like facing me from behind. That is true. Those sexy undies you mentioned, there's one that looks like a butterfly. You know everything. Then there's a particular one that I want you to wear. I'd give you money. The one I want you to wear, that you'd buy and wear, is like a slingshot they use to kill a deer. -G-string. -[laughing] That's it, a G-string. Such a bad girl, Bukenzo. A G-string. I will give you money tomorrow. Come tomorrow and I will give it to you. Come on, come on, touch my body. Now, we have agreed on the weekend. I'll come this weekend. [exhales] We will do everything this weekend. -[sucking breath] -[blows kiss] [in English] You have to look beyond the surface. A good writer hides his message in between the lines. And it will take only a good reader to discover it. [Shade in Yoruba] Please. Please. -Please! -[Adunni] Shade! [panting] [in English] What is wrong with you? -What's the problem? -Nothing. Nothing? [in Yoruba] What do you mean by nothing? -Nothing. -Ah. Nothing? [panting] [Gbemisola] Sha. Sha. -Ah, Gbemisola. -Yes, Sha. -[in English] How are you? -Uh, you "shay" I, uh, should... [sighs] -You "shay"... -[in Yoruba] Gbemisola, speak Yoruba. Okay, you said I should come today, Sha. [in English] Oh, yes, that's true. [in Yoruba and English] But I have some things to attend to. [in Yoruba] I hope you don't mind meeting tomorrow. Okay, Sha. Can you come to our house, Sha? -[in English] Good morning, sir. -Good morning. -You know I'm not your home teacher. -[chuckles, sighs] [in Yoruba] Sha, I'll be a good girl to you. I also want to sit for the upcoming WAEC exams, Sha. -Mmm. -Yes, Sha. Take this, Sha. This is our address. Can you come around 4 p.m. in the afternoon? -4 p.m.? -Yes, Sha. I hope it wasn't your English notebook you tore like this. [laughs] No, Sha. -[in English] Are you sure? -[in Yoruba] No, Sha. I tore it out from my other notebook. Thank you, Sha. -[in English] All right, then. -[in Yoruba] Bye, Sha. [in English] Hi. Hi. [chuckles] What's your plan for the weekend? Uh, nothing. [in Yoruba] I don't have any plans. [in English] Would you like me to come up with one for us? What do you have in mind? I'll come to your house. You have any problem with that? No. Um... When would you like to come? On Saturday, 10 a.m. -Okay. -Okay. [in Yoruba] I'd like you to come with a "koroba" hairstyle. Hmm? Koroba? [in English] As in? Okay. [in Yoruba] If that is what you want... [in English] I'll do it. See you on Saturday. [wind whistling] [in Yoruba] This is 5,000. I hope it will be enough. [sighs] I need to buy a fragrance too. What is fragrance? Fragrance, the perfume I'll spray on my body. Don't you want me to smell nice for you? -I need to smell good. -[sniffing] I have been smelling you for a minute. The perfume you have on is okay for me. It's okay. Come on, add 2k. Why are you doing this now? I have given you my entire salary. Add 2k now! [giggling] I'll give you 1k. I'll give you 1k. 1k is all I have left. -[sighs] -I have given you all my money. Just give it. Look, look, look, I'll send you my address. Saturday morning. [in English] 8 a.m. on the dot. [in Yoruba] Without stress. -That's when you should come. -I hear you. Because morning sex is always the best. I understand, I understand. [laughing] [whispering] Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me. [in English] Calm down, ah-ah. [in Yoruba] Don't worry, I'm packaging everything for you. I'll give you it all on Saturday. -[laughs, exclaims] -[laughs] -[both kissing] -[sighs] Okay. [blows kiss] [upbeat music plays] -[in English] How far? -[chuckles] -[in Yoruba] Did it go well? -[in English] Trust me. [in Yoruba] How much did he give you? -5,000. -5k? This girl, you know the job. You now know the job better than me, your master. Money. Go on. Ah-ah, this is money. Here, take 1k... for the brain work you did. -Uh-huh, 1k. -That's your cut. -Out of 5k. -No. -No problem, I'll manage it. -No, don't manage it. I don't have an option. -Look, one more thing. -What is it? There's more where this money came from. I know that. Don't give him anything. Don't even open anything. Don't even let him touch anything. He can never touch anything. Just continue to give him hope that he will hit it, and we will be cashing in, you get me? -You understand. -But you're so smart. [in English] The human skeleton is the internal structure that serves as a framework for the body. This framework consists of many individual bones and cartilages. Now, there are also bands of fibrous connective tissues-- the ligaments and the tendons. [voice fading] Now this is the human skull, this is the frontal bone, and this is the eye socket. It houses your eyes. This is the nasal bone... [dramatic music] [Yemisi in Yoruba] Shade, you didn't go to school today. Is that good? I'm not going back. Eh? I'm not going back. You are not going back? Shade, what is wrong with you? Talk to me. I am your friend. [sighs] Shade, you can't just stop going to school, because me and you have plans. I said we both agreed that you'll be the lawyer and I'll be the investigative journalist. So if I'm exposing the bad people, you'll be sending them to jail. Now you are saying you're not going back to school. Is that good? Look, Shade, let me tell you, my uncle already said he will send me money so that when we are on break, instead of me just sitting at home while we wait for admission, I'd just go for a crash course on journalism. Now you're saying you're not going back to school. You must go back to school because I still have faith in our plan. You must go back to school. You can't say you won't. Why would you say you're not going back to school? -[Gbemisola and Bode laugh] -[Bode in Yoruba] Why do you laugh? I saw your age in the document you submitted. And I saw that you're 20 years old. [in English] Which means you can give consent, right? -[giggling] -Hmm? -You sure? -Mm-hmm. [in Yoruba] Then I want you to know this relationship is not a student-teacher relationship, and you know we are not in school. That's true. You're right. In this place that we are in... [in English] I'm not your teacher. And you're not my student. [Gbemisola chuckles] [in Yoruba] Ah, what are you doing? -I want to... -[both laugh] -Wow, all these young girls nowadays. -You should stand up. If you stand up, you'd enjoy it even better. -Eh? -Mm-hmm. -[laughs] -Okay. -There's no reason to waste time. -Mm-hmm. All these dogs have been barking all day long. They're worried about you because they know. It's the neighbor's dog. -Mm-hmm. -Yee! -Calm, calm down. -Don't let me calm down. There's no time. Calm down. [giggling] [door opens] Hey, God has caught you today. [woman laughing] Drop that pillow. I said drop that pillow! -Gbemisola. Gbemi-- -You... You think you can embarrass me in front of everyone in class. You made me look like a fool and a laughingstock. -Gbemi... -In front of everybody, right? -Kneel down right there. -What? I said you should kneel down and raise your hands! -Look at him. -[camera clicks] Now listen and open your ears attentively. I want to be the first. What did I just say? -You want to be the first. -Good. Now you see this-- my friend Ronke standing behind me will be the second. Do you understand? -I have heard you. -Say "Yes, Ma" to me! -Yes, Ma. -Look at him. Now get up and pick up your useless pants, and get the hell out of my face! -Shameless man. -Look at him, useless man. -[door slams] -[all laughing] -Ha, God caught him. -I am Gbemisola. [in Yoruba] I want to cook on Sunday, and I'd like you to come have lunch with me. Mm, I want to make pepper stew and put it in your mouth. You see, these pink lips of yours will turn to red. Uh, sorry, Ma. The door is open, so I didn't... [Lolade in English] Yes, so, um, we'll continue with... [in Yoruba] Come! What are you always looking for? Shade has dropped out, Ma. Yes. The doctor said she should take a break. She needs to rest because they want her brain to recover. The hard drugs she did was too much. Shade didn't do any hard drugs, Ma. There's something going on, and we don't know what because for the past two years, after we went on break, one female student refused to come back to school. But we are not on break. I know we are not on break, but for the past four years, a female student would slip into depression. After a few weeks, she would refuse to come back to school. Ma, there's something going on that we don't know, and it's not hard drugs. There's something deeper than we think. And we need you, Ma. We need you to do a proper investigation on what is going on. Look here-- [in English] Because for every girl who drops out, Ma, a dream dead. And our community is losing its potential female leaders. [in Yoruba] Come, what is wrong with you? Are you smarter than the doctors who diagnosed that she abused hard drugs? -[scoffs] -What-- what's all this? She's your friend, right? A very close friend, eh? Go advise her to see a doctor. You said she left school. She already dropped out from school. [in English] She's no longer my responsibility. I keep telling you girls, take responsibilities for your actions. [in Yoruba] Hard drugs are not good. Being a wayward girl is not good. This will serve as a lesson for you and your friends, so go back and warn them. Now leave. -[chatter] -[door closes] [chatter stops] [students in English] Morning, sir! [Bode] Good morning, everyone. How are you? [students] Fine, sir. Yeah, how are you? [students] Fine, sir. How are you doing? [students] Fine, sir. Well, starting from today, there's no reason standing up to greet me whenever I come into your class again, okay? -Wow. -Wow, really? Yes. So, you can now have your seat. Thank you, sir. All right, so-- Sha! [clears throat] -[Gbemisola] Hmm. -Yeah, what is it? [in broken English] Our exercise book. [stammering] Oh, yes, sure. Why not? -Um, class captain. -Yes, sir. Please come. Have this. Share this. Shola. Obafemi. Gbenga. Quima. Ronke. Gbemisola. -[Gbemisola] Sha. -[girls giggle] [Gbemisola clears throat] [in broken English] Make we say our mark? -[girls giggle] -All right, go on. [chuckles] Nine. [students shouting, murmuring] Make my neighbor say her own. All right, please go on. -[accented English] Eight. -[students shouting, murmuring] -[both giggling] -[murmuring continues] [mysterious music] [mysterious music continues] [knocking at door] -[Adunni in English] Hi. -Hi. You're beautiful. [in Yoruba] Hope it wasn't difficult to locate this place. Not really. Your neighbors are so nice. In fact, one of their kids brought me here. We still have some good people in our neighborhood. That's true. Um, thank you for the other day. [in English] My laptop is working very fine now, thank you. [chuckles] You're welcome. [sighs] [in Yoruba] I hope I didn't interrupt anything. No, no, not at all. I just finished. And I have something to talk to you about. I was thinking, it looks like you're underutilizing all the gifts God gave you. You're meant to be working in a big IT firm and getting good pay, not working in that type of school. [sniffs] [in English] It's, uh... It's an honor to help raise the Zuckerbergs and Jeff Bezos in Nigeria. [in Yoruba] And the school has promised me that they will open a computer lab, and I'll be the computer teacher. -Mmm. -Sit down. Thank you. [sighs] Well, you know... that is also good, because in the near future, those kids and their parents would be praying for you, because I know... [in English] they will be very good, you know, and they won't stop praying for you. [Adunni] Mmm... [slow music] Stop! -Stop it! Stop! -[in Yoruba] Let me finish. Finish? Finish what? Just get up! What nonsense. Go finish with the person in the picture. Idiot. [door opens, closes] [in Yoruba] Look, don't be mad that I didn't go over that night. My mother was sick. Look, we had to rush her to the hospital that Friday night. I came to school from the hospital, and I'm going back there after school. Please, I'm sorry. [tsks] Leave me alone. I have heard you. How is she feeling now? She's getting better. She's getting better. Look, Bukky, I won't lie to you. What you did really hurt me. -Aw. -[mocks] Ah. That night, what you did really hurt me. You couldn't even call me to say, "Baby, this is what happened," and you can't make it. I had taken herbal solutions. -I drank 22 combinations. -Oh. [tsks] -My anaconda didn't sleep all night. -Oh... My anaconda was up and didn't sleep all night. Aw, come to think of it, all the money you gave me the other day, we used all of it to pay the hospital bill. I didn't even have one naira to buy a recharge card to call you. And we still have some medicine we want to buy. Eh. [fake crying] I don't want my mommy to die. -[crying continues] -Stop crying. Stop crying. Your mommy can't die. My mommy... I don't want her to die. [crying continues] How much is left? About 8,000. Eh?! -Eight what-- 8,000? -It's 8,000. Where do you want me to get that kind of money? 8,000 naira, where do I get it? I don't have it. I don't have 8,000. If by any chance I pay the hospital bill, they will discharge my mommy today and I'd be able to sleep over at your place if you are not on night duty. Eh, forget about night duty. I'd lie to them. I already know what lie to tell them. If I can pay the bill... I don't have 8,000. -I don't have 8,000. -[tsks] Okay. So how much do you have? -This is all the money I have with me. -Eh... Oh, Mommy. [crying] 4,800 naira is what I have left. Find it. [tsks] If it weren't my mommy... [singing] -Take it. -Ah. Thank you, baby. Have you eaten? I haven't eaten. I have given you all my money. Okay, take this 300. Go find something to eat so that before night comes, you'll have energy for all the fun we'll have. Ah! Bukky Bukenzo, naughty girl. You can see I'm nice. [blowing kisses] 7 p.m. in the evening. That's no problem. I have told you I'll come. Let me get going. Come on, hug me. -Ah-ah, I will come at 7 p.m. -What is wrong with you? You want to refuse me after giving you all my money? Okay, fine. That's enough! 7 p.m.! [girls giggling] -What's up? How did it go? -[chuckles] He fell for it. -He fell for it? -Very well. -I said it. -I also knew. I knew he would fall for it. Did he give you money? Of course! This girl, you're too smart. 3k, 3,000. Take your cut. Ah-ah, as usual. -That's your share. -Thank you, dear. Anyways, how did you know he would give me money? What? How wouldn't I know he wouldn't give you money? Don't you know that when a man thinks with his penis, he can't think with his head? -Funke, Funke, you, this girl. -Eh? [giggling, chattering] [dramatic music] [in Yoruba] I thought he was being funny when he first said it. It was like a joke to me until I realized the reason he asked me to get this hairstyle. [scoffs] But this hair I'm seeing looks okay. Or don't you see it? [laughing] You are such a hypocrite. I loosened my hair. I dropped my wig to get this koroba, like a person going to war. Don't be mad, Tunde's wife. Aunty Adunni. We have your class now, Ma. Okay. You haven't left! Didn't you hear what I just said? Don't start taking it out on the poor girl. Whoever is the woman in that picture-- I don't know, and I didn't want to know. That was why I didn't ask him. What nonsense. It's okay, you hear? Don't take it out on students in the class, eh? Teacher's wife. -[snickers] -It's not your fault. I'm the one who went to you with my problem. -[tsking] -[laughing] Don't be mad. [door closes] [in Yoruba] Oluwadarasimi, my son. -Wow. -Daddy. Are you going to work on a Saturday? What is that supposed to mean? You started again. Wait a minute, is there anything a man does for his wife that I don't do for you? I give you food, I buy you clothes, I give you money. The landlord has never knocked on our door to ask for rent, so what is your problem? Who says I'm talking about the landlord knocking on our door? Or what am I even saying? I don't blame you. I blame the women you go to. If they didn't give you attention and they truly know you have a wife at home and responsibility, and didn't entertain you, you would sit at home and not go to them. -I should sit in the house? -Eh. [scoffs] With who? I should sit at home with you? You're not ashamed. You don't see what you look like. Look at yourself. Go pick up our wedding album. Yeah, go get it. To see yourself when I married you and see yourself now. This is me. I have been this way since we got married. I take care of myself. But because you gave birth, you allowed yourself to get really fat. Are you the first woman to ever have a child? You're telling me to sit at home with you. You should use your hands to cover your face. Look, I have a business meeting with Tunde. -Whatever. -What kind of meeting is that? Why would you say I got really fat, eh? It was when I gave birth. I just got a little fat. I am just fat. It's not like I killed someone. Also, those women you go to, if their husbands didn't do their duties and take good care of them, treat them like princesses, make them feel beautiful, would you go meet them? It's because their husbands take care of them. Why don't you do the same with me? You are now saying I'm fat. Madam who can talk... I would advise you, all this energy you are using to talk, you should save it. Take it to the gym to burn all this fat away. [solemn music] [woman crying] [in Yoruba] Look at my daughter. Look at what he did to my daughter. [crying] Whoever did this evil thing to my daughter must be arrested by the authorities and be brought to justice... because he is an animal, and an animal shouldn't be walking amongst men. Madam, don't worry. We will do our job. The medical report shows it was forceful entry, unfortunately. But please calm your mind. When she wakes up, I'll talk to her. So the information she gives us is what we will use to investigate and catch the criminal. But you just calm your mind. We will do our job. You have to catch him and bring him to justice. He has to be sentenced to prison. -[crowd in English] We want justice! -[man] What do we want? -[students] We want justice! -[man] Justice for who? Gbemisola! -[man] What do we want? -We want justice! -It's okay. It's-- I know! -[students] We want justice! -[man] Justice for who? -[students] Gbemisola! -[man] What do we want? -[students] We want justice! Can you keep-- I know. Just calm down. [chanting quiets] No, I know what you all want. I feel your pain and I'm feeling the same way myself. Just calm down. The police have promised us that the person responsible will be arrested... -[students] Yes. Yes. -...and face the law. Then the school management will not rest until Gbemisola gets justice. -[students] Yes! -So just calm down. You don't need all this drama, okay? Just calm down and go to your various classes. -[man] What do we want? -[students] We want justice! -[man] What do we want? -[students] We want justice! -[man] What do we want? -[students] We want justice! -[man] We want justice! -[students] We want justice! [crowd chanting] We want justice! We want justice! [chanting continues] [dramatic music] [door opens] [door closes] [in English] How are you? [in Yoruba] May I? [sniffles] Are you okay? Gbemi. Who did this to you? Tell me. I didn't see his face. Adeola refused to go back to school. We don't know why. But some people said somebody raped her. Shade started acting like a crackhead. They said she did hard drugs. She also refused to go back to school. Gbemi, here you are. Who will be next? Is it Bisola? Or Olamide? Even if I tell you... nobody would believe me. I'd believe you. I'd believe you. [crying] Yemisi... If I tell you, what would you do? Are you going to get the police to arrest the person? Even if they catch him, they can't do nothing to him. They can't do nothing to him because there's no proof. I'd end up a laughingstock. And I don't want my mom to die. Did he say he will hurt your mom? Okay, Gbemi, tell me. It will be between me and you, and I won't tell anyone. I'd just advise our friends to avoid the person. Gbemi, tell me. -Yemisi... -Eh? [sniffles] Can I trust you? You can trust me. Photo. [sobbing] [melancholy music] [keyboard clicking] [mysterious music] [in Yoruba] I was thinking, Gbemi should come back to school soon. She has been discharged from the hospital. [laughs] Like I already know-- nobody will talk about her, let alone demand justice for her. Look, everybody is already living their normal life. -Let me be frank with you-- life goes on. -Mm. Let's leave this topic and let's talk about us. -What are you talking about? -[murmuring] -Leave me alone. -Ah-ah. [no audible dialogue] Adunni. -Adunni. -Hmm? [in Yoruba] It would be nice if you talked to your friend. I don't know why he's moody. [scoffs] Haven't you noticed for some days now? Some people have been acting like snakes among us. We don't understand, but God knows best. [in Yoruba] It looks like she isn't ready to see anyone. That's why she didn't come out. I'd advise you to come back another day. Or... what do you think? Okay, I have heard you, Ma. But, Mommy, tell her Yemisi stopped by to see her. I'll tell her. -Yemisi? -Yes, Ma. -I'll tell her. -Thank you, Ma. -Thank you. -Bye, Ma. -I'm grateful. -Yes, Ma. -Bye. -Yes, Ma. [frantic music] [gasping] [cries out] [gasps, panting] [phone ringing] [sighs] -Gbemi... -[ringing continues] [in English] Hello. [phone beeps] [mumbles] [phone beeps] [mysterious music] [mysterious music continues] [no audible dialogue] [woman crying] [in English] Picture. Picture. Picture. [sighs] [in Yoruba] I spoke to Gbemi a few days ago. She said something about pictures. Did she ever mention? -[dramatic music] -[footsteps receding] [door opens] [in English] Just sit. Sit down. Can I have the result books for the class? Uh, sure. Why not? Thank you. Officers, arrest him. [dramatic music] Excuse me, Ma. I know nothing about this. -You know something about it. -I know nothing about this, Ma. I know nothing about this. I'm innocent, please. -Come, let's go. -Ma-- please, Ma, please! I know nothing about this! I am innocent. I know nothing about this. I know nothing about this. Ma, please! I know nothing about this! I'm innocent! [in Yoruba] Officer, please. [in English] I know nothing about this. -Let's go, let's go. -Miss Adunni, please! Miss Adunni! Miss Adunni, you know I know nothing about this. [in Yoruba] I'm innocent, Officer! [in English] Mr. Tunde! Please, I know nothing about this. [shouting indistinctly] [in English] Principal, please, I know nothing about this. [in Yoruba] Officer, please! Officer, please! -[engine starts, door slams] -[Bode continues shouting] [solemn music] [in English] The man is innocent. That is for the court to decide. Ours is to gather evidence and make arrests. The court will then prosecute and give justice. [scoffs] I have to go, please. [grunts] -[phone ringing] -Sir-- sir-- [Yemisi sighs] [tsks] Hello, Shade. Shade, you need to tell me who this person is. Shade, please, please, see. An innocent man has been arrested, and it doesn't make sense... [in Yoruba] that he's paying for someone else's crime. [in English] Shade, see, I promise you, once this murderer has been arrested, you are fine. There won't be any harm to you or any of your family members. [in Yoruba] Shade, please tell me. Please tell me. It doesn't make sense that this rapist is out there walking as a free man. Who is he going to harm next? Who is he going to rape next? Shade, you know-- [exhales] Shade. -[in English] Sir, is there-- -[phone chimes] Okay. "Okay. Thank you." Thank you, sir. -[mysterious music] -[birds chirping] [in Yoruba] I have been calling and you're not answering my call. Shade! Ah! Why is Shade behaving like this? [in English] Ah, good afternoon, Ma. -Good afternoon, my dear. -Sorry to disturb you, Ma. I've just been trying to call Shade. She's not picking her call. Please, is she at home? No, Shade is not at home. Okay, but is anybody at home? Maybe Mommy, or...? They have all gone to the mortuary. Shade committed suicide this morning. [sighs] [crying] -No. No. -It's okay, it's okay. -Ma, no, no. -It's okay. -No. No, Ma. -It's okay, it's okay. -It's okay. -I saw Shade yesterday. She did not commit suicide. No. I know! -Shade! [sobbing] -It's okay, it's okay! -[screaming] -It's okay, it's okay. -I know. [sobbing] -[screaming] [in English] She finally agreed to speak up, and then... she was found dead. You mean we have the wrong person and that Shade's death may be linked to Gbemisola's? Yes. The system has procedures, and we have to follow it before judgment can be passed. What? Lady Justice is blind. And, trust me, it is based on evidence, not emotions. So we will not, in the pursuit of justice, jail innocent people. The system still has procedures, and it is based on beyond all reasonable doubts. We will need more proof before we can prosecute the case. So if you have any information to help in this investigation, please do give me a call. All right? But not to worry. I'll reopen the case. That, I can guarantee. -Thank you, Ma. -Welcome.

[in Yoruba] Did you sleep well? [in English] I'm not going to hurt you. I'm sorry if I scared you. I'm sure your friend missed you. It's a such a pity a brilliant girl like you just stopped schooling and you can't even tell anybody why. [in Yoruba] Where are your parents? I didn't see any of them on my way here. [cell phone beeps] [in English] I can hear and see you... so don't say or do anything funny. Continue to be a good girl, and the promises I made still stand. [ominous music] [screaming, crying] [melancholy music] [knocking] -[upbeat music] -[Suleiman in Yoruba] Please, Bukky. I want to know what is going on. [in English] I want to-- are you playing hanky panky or what? What are you doing, eh? [in Yoruba] This is the fourth time you've told me that you're coming, and I never see you. Are you... [in English] trying to play me for a fool, or what you do? What are you doing, heh? [in Yoruba] And I want to know, how is it that every time you come through this gate, I never set my eyes on you? Eh? Answer me! I came here to tell you I'm not doing anything with you. Eh? Please, what have we done that you say you're not doing anymore? Have we done anything? Let me tell you, anytime, anywhere you see me, you better look away like you didn't see me. And if you want to try to use your position as gateman to threaten me, I'll tell everybody you raped me. [shouts] [giggles] Come to think of it, I still have our text messages, you know. And Mr. Bode is still at the police station. -I'm sure you know, so be wise. -[exclaiming] Please, Bukky, don't be angry. What have we done, what did I do to you, that you're talking about the police station or jail? -Eh, eh. -Bukky, me, me! With all the money you collected from me! With all the-- with all the money you collected from me. Try nonsense, and I'll show you how to have sense. Ha! Yee... [in English] Bukky scammed me! [mysterious music] [panting] [in English] Auntie Kemi. [moans] Auntie Kemi. Auntie Kemi. [in English] I'm so proud of you all. [book thuds] It's akamu. I had pap last night, so it probably poured on it. [Tunde] All right, see you guys next class. Bye! [mysterious music] [in English] Photograph. [knocking at door] -[in English] Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. It's good to see you. You're welcome. Thank you. -You still remember my address. -[laughs] [in Yoruba] Yes, I do. I came to visit someone in the neighborhood, and I thought it wouldn't be nice if I didn't visit you. [in English] Wow, that's so thoughtful of you. [in Yoruba] What can I offer you? [intense music] [belt buckle clinking] [in English] Fuck, where is it? [sighs] Where is it? What are you looking for? [in Yoruba] What are you looking for? It's nothing. [in English] It was the photograph you were looking for, wasn't it? [sighs] So, it's true. [scoffs] I can't believe this. [in Yoruba] Who the hell is in that photograph you're looking for? [in English] Dang! This is crazy! [solemn music] [indistinct chatter] -[Tunde in English] Morning, class. -[students] Morning, sir. Please... I'm looking for a photograph that is so dear to me. [sighs] If by any chance any of you find it in your books or anywhere around the school, just bring it to my office. Sir, how does it look? It's a beautiful woman standing. Sir, who is she? My aunt. My... My mom's younger sister. That's my only memory of her. Let's get back to... to the matter of the day. [students murmur] -[knocking at door] -[Tunde in Yoruba] Who is it? I saw this picture this morning. Get out. [tense music] [chatter] -Yemisi. -Hmm? [in Yoruba] I want to thank you for the part you took in the arrest of Mr. Bode. The court will sentence him next week. -Are you sure? -Yes, now. My dad works at the federal court in Ikeja. He said you'll make a wonderful investigative journalist in the future. -Okay, thank him. -You're welcome. [sighs] I have to do all I can to get to the truth of the matter... [in English] and get justice for all my friends and victims of this man. I have to. [mysterious music] [mouse clicking] -[mysterious music continues] -[crickets chirping] [mysterious music continues] [Tunde in English] So, let me explain this to you guys. Example one, divide 2x squared plus 4-- -[door closes] -[tense music] 2 + 3 + 8 + 19. x - 2 + x + 4 + 3 - 2... [tense music continues] [tense music continues] [door closes] [Yemisi in Yoruba] Good afternoon, sir. Um... there are some topics you've been teaching us lately that I don't understand. So, I wanted to ask you, if it's convenient for you, to put me through me, sir. Sir, I don't know if Saturday would be okay for you to come to our house around 11:00. Everybody will be at one of my aunties' wedding. What part don't you understand? Uh... algebra, sir. The Pythagorean theorem. Or I can come to school if that's what you want. Or I'll go anywhere you want me to go if that's convenient for you. [in English] Anywhere? Any, sir. Anywhere. [paper rips] Meet me there. Okay, sir. [door opens] [door closes] [mysterious music] [soft music] [soft music continues] [no audible dialogue] [tense music] [insects chirping] [mysterious music] [door opens, closes] [doorknob turns] [tense music] [tense music continues] [in English] Good aftern-- [tense music continues] [Tunde clears throat] [in English] Don't be scared. How old are you? Twenty. What would you like to drink? I could go get it downstairs. Why did you tell me to come here? Why did you come here dressed like that? [tense music continues] Her name is Kemi. I called her "Auntie Kemi." She's not my mother's younger sister. She was our house maid. At about nine, when everyone leaves the house, Auntie Kemi would take me into her room and do all sort of... things to me. And this continued until I was 13. She threatened me that she would kill me if I tell anybody and no one would believe me. [thuds] And she was right-- nobody believed me. Even our constitution didn't believe me, because... a woman cannot rape a man. [tense music continues] I tried to live a normal life. At about 20, at my first year in university... there's this girl I liked. She later became my girlfriend. When we were making out... I couldn't get hard. No other woman can arouse me. I told her to let me place this photo beside her... but she refused. I couldn't control it. I regretted my actions, but I can't let it out. So I threatened to kill her if she tell anybody what happened. It worked. She didn't tell anybody. And I did the same to more girls, and more girls, and more girls, until you told your friends to talk. Why are you telling me this now? Because you deserve the truth. And if that's the only last wish I could give you, why refuse it? [Yemisi huffs] Do you think I'm excited to kill them? Do you think I like this life that I'm living? Then why don't you just stop? I have. [screaming] [Yemisi whimpering] [Yemisi whimpering] [screaming] [choking] [solemn music] [mysterious music] [phone ringing] [ringing continues] [in English] Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? [tense music] [ominous music] [keyboard clicking] [Yemisi screaming] [Yemisi gasping] [Yemisi screaming] [tense music] [man laughs] Ah... -[in English] That's why I like you. -[Kemi laughs] [knocking at door] [ominous music] [ominous music intensifies] [ominous music] [upbeat music] [man singing in Yoruba] ♪ And I scream so loud ♪ ♪ No one to hear my voice ♪ ♪ And I scream so loud ♪ ♪ No one to hear me out ♪ [singing in Yoruba] ♪ Who can help me? ♪ ♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ ♪ Who can help me? ♪ ♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ ♪ Who can help me? ♪ [singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[vocalizing] ♪ Who can help me? ♪ ♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ ♪ Who can help me? ♪ [singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Who can help me? ♪ -[singing in Yoruba] -♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ -[vocalizing] ♪ Who can help me? ♪ ♪ Eh, eh, eh ♪ ♪ Who can help me? ♪ [singing in Yoruba] [♪]
