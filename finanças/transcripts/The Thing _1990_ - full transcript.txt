Starting with this, from this great heritage. The goal is to build. A thing, a thing. Which is bigger, and if you allow me the expression, even more beautiful. What freedom? who says that Occhetto is setting you free? What is there to be free, from who you want to be free. (indistinct dialect) (dialect) (dialect) What is going to change? Because we don't know yet what is going to change. What are we witnessing today? What does need to change? they don't tell us if the symbol is changing. They don't tell us if the name is changing. And they don't tell us what is going to be the name. I'm convinced that the old comrades, If we change... If we change and take a name that is connected to the communist party. So if it is a continuation, I think they'll stay. But if the name is going to change, I don't know. With something that has nothing to do with the working class, I think that we'll. The communist party will lose, we'll take a great defeat. And all the the old comrades will remember this. Including Napolitano, including Luciano Lama, including all the others. -Occhetto? -"Occhietto" we still don't know. We are not sure yet, "Occhietto" made a proposal. I'm not saying we are not for- We are for the opening, we are for the renewal of the party. To always keep going with modern times. But let's not forget our comrades that have died fighting for this "Hammer and Sickle". I think that is wrong to connect. This word and so the PCI's name (PCI = Italian Communist Party). To what is the storic experience. Of these 70-80 years or so. Of communist experiences across the world. We keep arguing about a possible change of the PCI's name. About the "hammer and the sickle" symbol. Or who knows what, I still don't know. Or even better, I believe we still call ourselves, comrades. Tomorrow we are not going to call ourselves brothers or. Or something, I don't know. In short, to the people who ask us: "What is going on?" What do we have to respond? I'm basically in total embarassment. Not here now, but in front of the people. The people that point us out. Ask me "what are you-" and they mock us. And they laugh about us. On one hand we must avoid thinking that the things we think. Reflect all the party's thoughts. I say these word because. I found these words, I want to say this quietly. In the things that comrade Silvestro said at the beginning. He seemed like he was talking on behalf of the whole party. Every comrade here, speaks for himself. There are comrades with different positions. Who are forced to choose. From the importance, the rilevance. Of this discussion we're having. It's ok, the party is dividing. Let's not make a drama about it. I've been registered- I joined in '45, after the liberation. But you must know. That I went in the mountains to sing the red flag. With the partisans. In the Marcarolo's huts. And I can say that I'm one of those escaped. From that slaughter you know very well. Because we managed to escape the dutch. With big style. I mean, I'm not mad with you. Comrade Regional Secretary, because you were late. If we were in conspiracy time, it would have been a big problem. Comrades risked to lose their lives back then, when they arrived 5 minutes late. I did not join the party yesterday, I've been registered to the party for years. I've never seen an argument so wide and serene. In the party, like there is in these days. At least that means that people must discuss. Start discussing, they must confront. They must say their point of view. I consider them lucky. Those comrades (male or female). Who have clear ideas. I admit that... I'm in a crisis. I was in a crisis, and I'm still in a crisis. The proposal. Made to the central committee. By Occhetto. It came to me like a punch in the face. But not in a way that is... Negative. But it shook me. And it opened in me... A new will that was... Sleeping. Or better, it was not only sleeping. I was leaving it to the party. My son at home. He's 23 years old. I've got an older one. But he's out. He told me "But-". Discussing like this. Commentig the facts that television gave news about. He said: "You know that in this moment it stimulates me to..." he said to me. "To register to the party?" I told him, "Are you going crazy?". He doesn't understand anything anymore. The moments from the "Years of Lead". In our factory we had the red brigades, unfortunately. We also had a partner that I knew well. I worked by his side both as a worker and as a trade unionist. He was killed by the red brigades, we lived moments. Of strategy, terror, threats. To the companion Guido Rossa, of the death and after the death. Of Guido Rossa which has been dramatic. How do I lower it? All right. Nothing uh... I am quite new to this type of discussion. Because I have not been registered for 40 years, let's say. - Lucky you - And not even 20. And so... I can't, even if I wanted. Talk about ... go backwards. Tell what I heard, this morning. I can't, and anyway I don't want to. Even if I could, I would not do it. It seems almost like... a flee, a... To escape in the past, to find some help. I would be glad to have it, but I don't. A certain consequentiality however comes to mind. A certain consequentiality from what's happening in the East. And what the Italian communist party should do. I've always seen it as an escape goat at every speech. To every relationship, ecc. And then a question comes to my mind. I ask myself a question, no? I ask myself and others have asked me. From other people, outside the communist party. The question is: If you said that anyway you weren't. Connected to them. Why do you care so much about the fact that Honecker is under house arrest?" Or the fact that the countries of real socialism failed in everything? And why do you always talk about it in your speeches? This is the question I've been asked, a question that I couldn't answer. I think there are two answers. There's an emoctional fact or anyway a link. Always felt by someone towards those countries. Or maybe it's true that we weren't so detached from them. In fact, at the party of unity at Genova, I asked myself. Why weren't those movements invited. The Alternative movements from the East, why wasn't "Neues Forum" invited? The party has lost contact with the masses. I'm not saying it today, I've seen for a couple of years a vertigistic party. A party where the masses count very little. So, changing the name, or changing... We need to change the way we do politics. Occhetto for me started with the wrong foot because now he retracts. Him and the others from the secretariat like Mussi, that seems to want to make. Both militants and members, make fun of us, They say: don't talk about the name. You talked about the name first, in a wrong way, or we misunderstood? But it's the name. That hit the comrades the most. But you can't start from the symbol and the name and then retract and say. That now it's important to make the change. With who? How? With what thing? I, comrades, want to understand what's this "thing". Because it can be everything or it can be nothing. What does it mean to be communist anymore? What did it mean? What was it? Wrong theories? Not doable. During the years? In the development of society as it came, or really just wrong? Badly applied? Are the man that badly applied them? Sincerely I make a lot of... I have a lot of confusion. Confusion, pain... A lot of questions, a lot of... But mostly this. What can it become now. What it will be, we will see. Who among us will have the... The will to remain, partecipate. There will be someone. But for me, I will stay and watch. I'll try to understand. And then if in the future I will agree with what this party will be, again. But for me the point is just this, what has been, those that have been these 40 years of history. In the countries of the East. Where the one with power were communists. And where almost everything turned out, to the detriment... Of the people, of the people, I mean. With whom we will work and fight, and why will we work and fight? In this moment, I don't think. I don't think I'll renew the registration at the communist party. But not because Occhetto said to change, but because the word communism. For me lost it's real meaning, The one that my father teached me. Since i come from the "Manifesto", I remember. Old discussions we had between comrades of the Manifesto, "Comrades". Manifesto's comrades, back then you weren't called comrades. Anyway the PCI's comrades. And we said. No there's nothing to do with DC, nothing to do- (DC= Christian Democracy) But no, there are good things there too. It's about taking them, knowing how to balance them. Pull on our side, because they are not all the same. In Italy, comrades, it's been years we've been discussing between DC and Catholics. DC is a thing, Catholics are another, but. The Catholics that somehow got away from the DC. In their politic and militant way, are very few. Vertical crisis, I don't call it Communist's crisis, I'll explain later why. Of the countries of the East, presenting it like an identification. That for me, for my cultural history, doesn't exist absolutely. It was enough to read a little, to know, to understand. That communism was no longer that thing, nowhere communism it's made by bureaucrats. Nowhere is communism made on the skin of those who work. This is what happened in that country, now we say quietly. Within the communist party too. Some time ago in a debate. Someone said... it make me laugh. Talking, ending a debate, someone said: "Well we're definitely not the Bolsheviks" Like saying "You want to offend us or something?". In Lavinia no? He said, we are not Bolsheviks, we are true democrats. I don't want that in some future debate, no? Someone will say: "It's not like we're communists". Then I joined myself too because we start from where I was born, no? I was born in '45 too. It's from the discovery of the communist party that I started to- Excuse me for this little summary. I started working that I was ten and a half, and I worked 15 hours a day. And I asked my mom just before the war, "But mom, why there are riches and poors? "Why do they exploit me like that?" Poor woman, she could not answer me then, no? And I met the communist party in a fly- I will always remember. In a flyer thrown out and I was in a village, in the woods. I read this and I say: "Damn, this is what I want." And then I met the communist party, then analyzing now, back then it was like that. But I don't even feel like changing anything. Because I want to have my ideals, look what we have built. A different party in Italy, just to raise this lighthouse. These ideals of socialism, this thing so beautiful. Who brought us here, with a party different from there, they didn't even started it. A symbol or another symbol, a name or another name. What matters is the substance of the politics we do. The interests we carry forward and these things. To think that removed the symbol, oh my god it is no longer the communist party. Or it's no longer a force that brings certain interests. Honestly I don't understand this... This attachment a little... rigid, let's say so. To those that are in fact aspects of appearance. That is, what image this party today manages to give to new generations? Last election out of 100 young people, 18-19 voted PCI. Even 15. Even 15... out of 100. So or we old man remain here. Sustaining and bringing this flag. Or instead, together, because this it's the bet. We make a further contribution. So that this type of politics can take a different characteristic. I think we're focusing too much on one series of issues, that others force on us. I say: Occhetto did well, did wrong, consulted or not. Because Togliatti, when he landed in Salerno, who did he consult to establish. That big fact that determined a radical change in Italy? When he says: "I don't care with whom I am, the important thing is to beat fascism." You tell me, who did Togliatti consult back then? Or Longo when it comes down from the plane, says in Czechoslovakia. "It's a mess so we have to take this position", did he consult you? In the meantime we have an internal problem here. I say that the Perestrojka must also pass inside the PCI. I'm tired of hearing executives that for 10 years study a problem, and then keep studying it. Like Ingrao, institutional problems, 10 years he is studying. Like Tortorella, who is Tortorella? But let me understand, in the last years, what contributions did Tortorella give. For a cultural elevation, mine and of the party? The proposals, but I mean for fuck sake, here someone said let's go around the world. But where can you find a world that it's better than Emilia Romagna? For everything. The most beatiful society on the face of the earth. And I don't have presumption, I've never been presumptuous. To make judgments about others societies or other states, but I've travelled, I saw. And therefore, I say how we live here, maybe this. Makes us not understand certain issues. but it's not a fairy tail. But the politics that we have to make, I say. In the other 19 regions, 18 regions, we would manage to create. That politic that we succeeded to create here in emilia. See, this is the most beatiful city we could manage to bring together. Today new means are needed, and a relationship between means and purposes. That starting from non-violence, it places us outside the traditional history. Of the communist party, and passes it forward. I have always been one of the promoters of battles. Until I can, I will always do battles. And if you change the name, I will stay inside. But I will form a current inside the party. The one that I never wanted, I have always wanted the unity of the party. The name issue for us communists is marginal. Because we are used to consider the substance of things, and not the appearance. However we are aware of living in the society of information and image. So if the name and symbol change can serve to strengthen in the world outside the party. The understanding of PC renewal, then this decision is welcome. I was also talking to some comrade before this. We do everything you say, we do the reforms, we join the Catholics. We make the widest left wing alternative. But certain rooted things, like the name and the symbol, cannot be changed. Certainly some comrades put this as the last thing to consider. But for others it's the most important. We communists should shake off any presumption. To become again the men capable of interacting with the masses. If not, then the workers like those of the FIAT. That see the shareholders of their company. Dividing an annual capital equal to the whole salary of their workers. Or the young unemployed that every year increase more and more. Or the women so distinct, and not "different" as the PC states. To be the last to be hired, and the first to be fired. And that still today they die for parsley influences. So if we don't, who would represent them anymore? I will put it like this. How much distance is there between my personal direct experience with suffering. -I'm talking because this theme it's important for me- And the socialist comrades, for example, towards the drama of drug addiction. This is the theme of comparison with the socialist party. I see a great horizon open here, I call this horizon, need of communism. Because I can not tell the difference between the favelas in Brazil. Or the faces of the boys from Soweto, in South Africa. Or the touched and joyful eyes of the boys from Berlin, that broke that wall. Or that hug, that I think was one of the most beautiful aspects of these weeks. Between that extraordinary square, full of young people. And Alexander Dubcek, after 20 years from the '68, in Prague. This seems to me the meaning of the battle we must lead. Coming out of schematism, from emotions of preconstituted sides. And opening up between us, a great debate. and I want to say one last thing, really. This work we are doing is more strenghtful. If we are able to speak, not only to the intellectual. But if we are able to speak also to the comrade who has voted us for 40 years. And he stays right here, around the corner. If we are able to build around this debate, a great mass debate. Capable of coming out of the sections and confront the society. With the true people, the heart of this society, which by the way, it's our people. If I'm here this morning among you, it's because I urgently need to understand. I want to understand why this name, this politic, this PCI. That later I will call Mister X for convenience, today we find it inadequate. I joined and militated in the Mister X party. Because it was and is, the party of the great pacifist and environmentalist battles. When I think about Mister X, or at least, when I thought about Mister X. I thought of it as a big elephant, with very long ears. And a long proboscide, that never ended. Intent, however, in a slow and boring path for who knows what forests or which lands. But excuse me, what you would say if suddenly this elephant started running. Well, I was stunned. Dear Mr. X, please do not change without making us understand where we are going. Dear Mister X, I loved you, you taught me to have the courage to be indignant. But today I feel I can't do it, the hit was hard. Then I feel inside me, like Andrea said, a big need for Communism. A new one, but anyway his name is still "Communism". What have you communists taught to the Italians? Comrade Togliatti answered with a sentence that I think it's very sharp, very penetrating. "We "learned" the peasants. The workers, not to take off their hats when the master passes." This is what Communism was in Italy. If we say that we, as a communist force, as they call us Stalinists. We haven't been that for several years, approximately... -It was a bad thing though. -We are, excuse me. -That was a bad thing. -And you don't emphasize it, but this was a bad thing. -I've been sitting there for 3 hours, sitting. -I arrived now, It's the first time I join a section of the communist party. -Especially in light of recent events.... -Oh, anyway... -You have to tell me why there still are these discussions.. -If you want to talk... -What's happening is more important than... -Of all the stupidities that... -If you want to intervene. -It's clear to me the fact that the communist party must not change the name. -Comrade, if you let me.... -I've been 50 years in the party -If you give me permission to talk. -The PCI have nothing to envy. -Come here. -It was not the Russians who invaded Italy. -It was the Americans, and the Italian Communist is an authentic one. We must not change, we are superior to the Poles, to everyone. To everybody who call themselves communist. We are another matter, another thing. And finally we begin to discuss of concrete things. I'm tired of getting beaten in this country. I worked for 20 years at FIAT, and I am 20 years that I always get beaten. And it was about time that we begin to discuss for the alternative of this country. It would be wrong then if in this process, We do not question ourselves. In short, if we want to make the alternative In the true sense of the word, we have to understand. That others must come with us, because alone we will never make it. Certainly with the socialist party, just as today, it's not possible. But I say there are contradictions also within the socialist party. They too must question themselves about this great proposal. That the communist party is doing. I entered the communist party ... Not as a kid, even if since when I was a little boy, in my town. I traveled from the oratory to the league, there we called it "The League" . On one side there was the socialist party section. They were all nice, but they were always at the bar. And the communists, who instead were studying. And they inspired me a little fear too, a certain... But I saw them in the evening when they were there, studying. There were those who taught history of Italy, economy, to make counts, etc. But when I became, I came to Turin, dazzled by the problem of consumerism. I was the one of those who Toninelli at the beginning called, social worker. I didn't get along with the Piedmontese because they spoke in dialect, I did not understand. Authoritarianism was not good for me, and I was always at home, in mutual. And then I was changing factory once every six months. Who convinced me that basically it was worth trying for an adventure. It was the communists, a group of revolutionary communists workers. Who at the age of 18 made the civil war in our country, the resistance. And for me they were fascinating, because it was people who... When the boss came by, they did not bow their heads. They said their opinion, and I wanted to imitate them. They gave me the impression that you could stay inside the fabric, in a country like this. Without being a sub-proletarian rebel as I was, throwing rocks. To those who did not strike, but ... Learn to read and write, and to make the accounts. I saw that there were workers who had a library at home. And I was attracted to these things. When the communists lose their sense ... The idea of revolution, they lose the meaning of adventure. Communists without the sense of adventure become boring people. And as we saw there, even dangerous people. Yes , the DC is 40 years that governs. But the PSI is from '63 that governs, so the other parties are governing. It's not only the DC that is governing. It is not true that in the DC there are no healthy forces, dear comrades. Because it's not- I am more convinced that the workers. The workers, the unemployed, certain people, they go more there. In the DC, especially in the south. and in the PSI. The comrade Liliana Omegna said: "A party like ours, in the situation in which it was. It could not be woken up and revitalized, with a kiss from Occhetto." This party needed a strong proposal, that could shock. And that opened a discussion, starting from this, there could be a discussion. Beyond the fact that the method it is such that. Today, the whole party, and not just the party, is discussing this question. Bear in mind that, this proposal. Not only opens the contradictions inside the parties we call traditional. It opens them, I said it before, in the social body. But opens them, if I think of the other party, if I think of Confindustria. If I think about Federmeccanica, well, there is a problem with this proposal. Because, until yesterday, they could say "They are the usual communists. And we can decide to marginalize them or not". Today it's not that simple anymore. My perplexity is that... I don't know if to be more relevant, we should then... Yeald some things that now basically... No one dreams anymore about doing the revolution, nobody ... We accepted all the rules of the Western World. But it's also true that, at least for me. I'm here in this party because I hope. In a fair society, I hope that... Not to have the terror to get sick. Because today we know how the situation is. I'm pissed off because. I pay the taxes up to the last one lire and I'm always . I always see people who pay a lot less. And I wouldn't like that then... Let's say there's the fear, and not just mine, I repeat. Is that... in the end, in the party ther's a certain... A certain percentage, that still tries to take. Tries to take all the cake, because I must say this too. So, I don't know, because. I don't know, if tomorrow. The communist party or how it will be called, could get the 40% of votes, but. It would argue instead like Craxi and Andreotti now. And Forlani, they will fight with Craxi. For the presidencies of the RAI, of IDI, of this and of this other. Then I.... I don't care if we get the votes and do certain things, but then later. In the end the workers will always be there. With the same problems. Even this name that, like I said, we happen to have. In my opinion, If on one side, made it easier to identify to many people. Those that in the end, were different from others who wanted the change. On the other side made life easier for those who were against us. But, in the electoral campaigns. To me it seems like this. The others didn't use many Arguments against us, against the PCI like they're doing now. Saying this program, these proposal are not good. Instead, they referred to us of the facts happening in other countries. To say the word "Communist" , to make this word enter. In the head of the italians, in a negative way, to say "Ah, the italian communists..." And we waste, we wasted a lot of our time. To explain them, look we're different from the Chinese, from the Vietnamese. We're different from those in Moscow, we're different from the East Dutch. We're different from Prague, and often we use our time saying that we are different. Is it a replacement of the ruling class? Or a change of political class? As we say. I have already expressed that opinion. That the priests told me about in my town, of transposition. That a piece of bread in hand to a common mortal. And is called "ostia", from my parts was called "particola". And instead in the hands of the priest it becomes body of christ. So what are you telling me? That is enough to. Put communists in place of the socialists? That then things will become body of christ? Or also things that I heard inside the party, just take out the notables, and there are many. And we put the youngsters of 30 or 40 years, and things will change. It's not that simple, I've been seeking for renewal for many years. And I've thrown a lot of rocks. And that big coward here, Annibaldi, says that the communists. Are a bunch of scumbags because they don't care about the factory production. If he said, Ok now Mr. Romiti, I want to come to Mirafiori. And we're still in time, for the constituent, Occhetto-Mirafiori. But not in front of the gates, like his poor predecessor, in times of misfortunes. But to clearly say this thing here, and it's not a provocation. That the 50% of a car, is made with the hands. The hands of those who when go to vote, they vote left. Then Occhetto, if he has in mind the change of the ruling class. The workers emancipation, not to replace a political class with another one. Then he must ask to go inside, and say: Doctor, what is that you are saying. That I don't think about the production of the factory? But we saved it in '43, '48. In the '70 we ruled that factory together. The communist party has educated millions of people, laborers. Son of peasants like me and you that didn't know anything about. Metals, the logic of production, the organization, etc. If we could give some suggestions, as we find ourselves. In the start of a discussion that is unprecedent for our party. It's not comparable to any moment, even important, like '56. Even that was a big, dramatic discussion, even inside the party, or the '68. This is something truly extraordinary. And that anyway, in front of these changes. A refundation of our core, must be done. I was in Venice, to see the cinema exhibition. After many films, one day they presented the film by Moretti. I went to see it, and me, that I'm a communist. For the 40th time this year I renew the party card. I was taken by a huge sadness, like taking a kick in the balls. It's a film that I liked and a film that I was sorry for. But that doesn't mean I didn't like it. And indeed, the situation we lived until a few days ago, It was a situation of... Managing the manageable. I'm not here only this evening, I went to some other Milan's sections. In these days, and I must admit that I felt a great exaltation. And the sections are full like here, all the sections. In about 15 days we will do it at the "Ortica" too. The main merit of this provocation. Was to get us back the joy of being communists. Probably I'll continue to stay in the party, even if we... Start this new aggregation, this th- this thing. I'll continue to be here so there will be the presence of us communists. We, here, eat and we are fat like cows. The 500 million who do not eat, it is because we also eat for them. In the countries of real socialism, they never took advantage of these situations. Then we can talk about internal problems, democracy issues, etc. I agree. I lived all my life in the socialist countries, I know the great difficulties. The big mistakes made, etc. But let me say this, this too is the end of the Utopia. The end of this dream, of all men equal. Of men who could achieve themselves as men, and not like... So don't let me say tomorrow, that in this thing. That even America (trosa?) The USA's comrades, they eat the 25% of the product of all the world. And the popolation is not the 25% of (du ses million?), for god's sake. And they eat the 25% of all the resources of the earth, (ferditi?) and they'll always be. The most vile thing that nature have created. In the, in the th- and someone in the streets unfortunately still thinks so. So I remain anchored to my story, I'll enter this thing. With this baggage of history and experience. With the struggles, with the sacrifices, with the batons on the (Firulle?). With the handcuffs in "San Vittore" , I'll still be. Extremely proud of this story that I carry inside. And the history of this glorious party in which I have served all my life, And this, my story, in this story, I am willing to play. All the cards of renewal, without refoundation. There's no need to refundate a thing that was born so well, in '21. And that we leave to live like this, trying to create something around it. Maybe something new, something more aggregating, something that satisfies everyone. Certainly giving up something, but don't let me give up my story. Because on this thing I will do a bloody battle, all right? First of all, this proposal was expressed in a completely wrong occasion. On the wave of tumultuous events that are shaking the Eastern Europe. So how can we trust those who wish for the failure of both real and possible socialism. So that in the future it will be possible to say that, how the Italian Communist Party. Arose for the repercussions of the bolscevic revolution. Thus it disappears due to the impact caused from the facts of the east. An observation that certainly does not make us honor. That is to say that socialism and revolutionary ideals that gave body to it. Have only been a moment in history, they only belong to the 20th century. The very fact of being here in this section. Of hearing an alarm for this party, in which we believed and we felt was our instrument. It makes us, makes me say, then it is true that we were different from the others. We grew up and they told us "you communists are-" "You -our bosses told us- we are a different party". And I believed it when I was a kid. And I still believe it, even if I'm no longer a kid. Because the spring that stimulates us is the spring of brotherhood, of solidarity. If these tools disappear then I'll just sign up for the social-democracy. I just want to say that... I don't know how to put it, sincerely I am very grateful to Occhetto. For the proposal he made. To rediscover ourselves deeply and also to re-establish ourselves. Because I believe it was necessary. An act at the same time of humilty, great humility. And also of great pride, but mostly of humility, of which we seemed to need. Of which I also need, and it was needed by the party and their militants. Because... The idea that in front of of the revolution which is underway in europe. And that in a few months, in a few weeks it did... What in other times turned out to be a world war. The idea that, in the end, this thing here. We said, "But anyway it's not about our communism." That they have not listened to us. I had a feeling of inadequacy first of all of the "feelings". The famous feelings that in these days, in these weeks everyone talks about. Like an inadequacy of the heart of the communists. Towards what's happening right now. And I'm sorry, but I'm glad that the party secretary. Would fill this inadequacy of the heart of the communists. Because in the meantime there is something to be ashamed of, even ourselves. It's not like we are not involved, those are lies. Beginning with the fact that, it is true we didn't... At the last second we didn't send a delegation to the congress. Of the Romanian fascists, but at the penultimate second, we sent it. I did not ... I had a clear sens- a lack of heart. There is a revolution going on, with millions of people who. Say certain things, all that we have to say is. No? Anyway we're not involved, something like "Mani Pulite" a little out of place. An act of humility to say that what is happening. It must make us re-discuss, it can also mean that maybe. At least say that maybe we were wrong. Maybe there's somethig to reconsider. At least say it, I had the feeling instead. In a reflex like to say, defensive, very strong, of the brain and not of the heart. Well, these three things. Compatible development, non violence. Including the verbal one, as far as I'm concerned. Of which I would prefer not to make use in any case towards. Political opponents or different politicians. Violence, non violence, also verbal, and democracy are not made in PCI. That's how it is, they are not made in PCI. Not only then, the communism of the others, the one that failed, the one that... But not even our communism. We can't always think that our task is to historicize others. [unclear] To historicize the others, we historicize ourselves only when things are done. I believe we must do a great act. Of humility, because the winning political and cultural operations. Start from humility, so the desire to see if. Not only what we did wrong, but also if we are doing wrong now. And then make a great act of pride. Without which I would not bear too much humility, I would rather go fishing. To do a new political lineup, in which what we built in these. Great years of history and hard work from everybody. Will not be lost. I would not accept to have worked so much like a mule. To see what I've done. I don't know if like, decline, but in short, marginalized, I would prefer... To spend it in something that has a chance. This re-foundation, this, this constituent. In my opinion, it would be necessary. First of all we have to maintain all the communist that there are now. No, because otherwise, I mean, if you start even with a little less. I don't know how all the others will be ready to clap their hands saying "See?". Let's try to get all there and all together, to this stage. That it's constituent because you can hear already, here and there. A certain "sectarianism" , I want to use this word. We can last another 30 years this way, comrades. At an election we'll have plus 1%, another election we'll have minus 2%. The socialist party will take plus 2%, it will take plus 1% the DC. And DC with the socialist party will continue to rule. Then maybe next friday there is the discussion about drugs. And we will be split in half because the others don't care. If we make a new party, or even stay like this. One condition is that we start to make politic again, comrades. Even to say our opinion, of course to say our opinion first of all, to criticize. But we must come back, but then if we fight about the name. And then go back to watch TV. We must continue to work, comrades. I repeat, we need everyone in San Casciano, too. And if next friday, when there will be the discussion about drugs. Instead of being 200, we'll be 60, something's wrong. I think, in my honest opinion. That this party is losing votes because is no longer left-wing. And to clarify, I didn't renew my registration the last two years. Because I don't agree with this party, with this politic. Soft, and I call it of "ruffling". But with who do we want to make this thing? Everybody ignore us. We had to put "Indipendente" mayor of Rome because no one wanted to be there. Then who's going to do politic with us? With who, the socialists? The demo-cristians? Because you think the DC will vote a union with the communists? If you allow me, I don't believe it. I don't believe in fairy tales, and this is a fairy tale for me. I'll tell a joke, criticize me if you want, earlier a comrade said: "Actually we are becoming a socialist-democratic party". Now regardless of wether we for some years have been connected. To the European Social Democratic party, we took them as our ambition and goal. We have been like this for 20 years, comrades. We have to discuss about this, comrades. Otherwise we'll remain attached with this name. That becomes almost a shield, behind which we hide our difficulties. And I don't want to discuss the name. So, if this is necessary, because. I have another fear. - Can I? I remember the time, comrade. - Yes, go on. That it was just a comedy, the one of the companions of the secretariat. Of course it was forced. Of course it was. My conscience makes me say that in certain times. Maybe some forcing is needed, or you can't go on. Comrade Berlinguer did some forcing, even if some "Berlinguerian", like me. Who here, before me, didn't agree, well, Berlinguer did it. He did it both on the "Historical Compromise", on the NATO. Even on- He forced it, he didn't consult the party. Neither he made a referendum, no? Maybe they were less bitter. This is just to remember the truth. The end of Communism. But has there ever been "Communism"? Has there ever been a society, of those in the East. In wich Communism has ever been made? I remember, I was a boy, I think it was the 22nd or the 23rd congress. The Soviet union presented this ideas in which they said. They had to overcome the socialism phase. To move to a Communist Society. But they didn't even reach the socialist phase. Not even a bit of socialist legality. They didn't reach it, they only achieved a state capitalism. And we decree in 70 years, little more than 70 years. The end of a utopia as it says here, a great utopia. I came here really happy, because I feel happy. Maybe I'll be a "White Fly". I finally heard new discussions. New proposals and a new road, finally. Instead I come here, I feel like, It seems to me, no offense to anyone. To hear the priests talking, we are idolaters. Because the comrades that have been, that died, with all the respect. The comrades that put time in this, like myself for 12 years. - Aging like priests in seclusion. - We have also earned something. - What? - We also earned something. Yes, of course, for me it was an experience. That made me grow, that brought me many things. It also took away some others. However let's say the net was positive. I came here, I heard the same speeches again. And they will be the same speeches, comrades, you'll make for another 40 years. Because in 2023, you'll still be talking about the socialists. About Craxi, about the DC. And about these things, nothing will be changed. Because this is the right proposal, revolutionary nowadays. That puts everything into motion, the Italian political system. That blows the Italian political system. I want to make an appeal to the comrades, who don't have to be resentful. We all are resentful, because the red flag makes everyone shudder. Including myself. But let's not stop there, let's see the political substance. What's the point of political substance? It's to create an alternative in Italy. Because the alternative is either social-democracy, or nothing. It's useless for you to say that the discussion still is. If we have to transform, like the comrade said, in a social-democratic party. Comrades, it was not Occhetto that woke up. You are showing me that you are waking up. From a dream, because it's been at least 20 years. That the communist party is not a communist party anymore. I affront this in a isolated way. Because basically nobody here has ideas like mine, in the commission. You know that I talked at the congresses about feminism, of self-awareness. Of certain things at an embryonic level, with the due cultural limits. But nobody ever answered me, so it's a big... Let's not say trauma, but let's say commitment, to come here. Because it means that I have to adapt to a kind of culture that is different, softer. Why don't we create a project? why don't we work on projects? I'm not interested in Craxi, I pity him. I pity him in the true sense of the word. I find him pathetic when he laughs, when we know there's nothing to laugh about. Our referent must not be a symbol or a party. Our referent must be all those people who are willing. To dedicate all their lives, understand? Without drama, without. Risking their lives. I had to separate from someone to be able to dedicate my life to... Because you can't do many things together, you lose your balance. I lost my balance for a while. Our referent must not be things said in advance. Our referent must be the people willing to work with us. To change this society, all of it. Including the dismembering of the Vatican. Which is the most hierarchical and monarchical society that there is in the world. These people must be the referent, with these people, they- We have to elaborate concrete facts and projects, not ideas. I want to do politics. I have an incredible desire to do politics but I don't do it anymore. I don't do it anymore because there's no point in coming here. But not because the comrades who are here are not worth a penny. They are very sweet people, but they never argue. It really chaps my ass, all my life. And I come here and this thing, it has no value. I keep it inside me and I live it on my own. So, in the workplace, that is the school. The misery that exists everywhere. And therefore knowing there is people like me. So being with you, knowing we are still many, I feel glad. I can bear Willy Bramdt because Willy Bramdt is a temporary thing. Because he has his own issues with the Nuclear Power Plants. With that choice that has been. The choice that these democracies did, I don't care about it. But it's a train I can take because it can do me good. But I don't care about his type of model of development. I am a communist and as an ideal I have the abolition of private property. But not because I want to take away -like the DC said- The house from the people, like I don't want to give them nothing. I want the means of production and of exchange to be collective. This is the focal point that distinguishes me from the others. From the social-democrats. They can say they tolerate private property. I dont fucking accept it. Hospital here could work if. If you hear what they say, the hospitals work badly. Because they are public. What is this? They work badly because they are abandoned. They must work good, and they must be public. This is the fondamental difference between me and the socialists. When I was a boy. And I fought in the streets, and Morricone knows. We thought about the proletarian dictactorship. But in a good way, we thought that the working class, the soviet would rule. Understand? This is the focal point, in a good way. Because the party is structured in a way that who is going in charge. Then governs like he wants. Got it? And then he's not free anymore. If we were ruled by Russia, or other east countries. They would have kicked our ass, me and you, and you and you. Why? Because we are pestering. Am I wrong? Then, then. Me too when someone talked bad about Eastern Countries, I was bothered. Because they are Communists too. Now I grew up. I know that the man is a man and he can be wrong. Then I want to create some assurance. The party must be structured differently from how it's structured now. Meaning that I must be able to talk, and I must be important. Not that somebody- Like when there was the Historical Compromise, and we didn't agree with it. And we fought in this section because of the Historical Compromise. Do you remember it Morric?? The comrades made the "conclusions" at the end. What the fuck did you conclude if we were all against it. Is it true? Am I wrong? He "concluded". Now I felt a boost, an incentive again. Who came here to discuss things that you didn't think? The drug-addicts, the gardens... The fact is that the new- It's the discussion about the new communist party programs. He made the 18 congress, he told you very clearly. The fact is, if you go forward, you lose a part of the party. If you go back, everybody will be against you. Thanks to all the people who made this film possible.
