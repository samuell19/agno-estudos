Get your Sunday morning paper. Paper. Get your Sunday morning paper. Get your Sunday morning paper here. Paper. Morning paper. Well, goodbye father. - It's wonderful having you back. - Sure is good to be back, let me tell you. I'm afraid it'll be a little tame for you after where you've been. Well, I guess I can stand it if the parish can. Well, good night father. Good night. Father, over here sir. Yes? Father, I got to talk to you. I'm a stranger here and I, I got to tell somebody about this thing while I can. - In case anything happens to me. - Happens to you, why? If you just listen to. - Sorry has to be here, in the church but... - You're not Catholic my boy? No, I'm not. You're father Logan, aren't you? The Jumping Padre, always the first one out of the plane? You don't know me but I've heard of you. See, I'm a paratrooper too, an ex-paratrooper. Well now, all the more reason for me to listen. - You know, I was just going to... - If you just hear me out sir. - I haven't much time. - Oh, what's the trouble my boy? - I'll not only hear you, I'll help you out. - No, you can't, not in this. See, by now the cops are after me, not that I've done anything wrong father but... it's a couple of pretty tough customers back who listen want to get their mitts on me. Probably grab me as soon as I show in the streets again. I can't work this out, I want somebody to know what happened. The sake of a friend of mine, to clear his name. Oh, what is his name? Johnny, is a pal of mine, he was a paratrooper too. See, it's like this sir. A few days ago they flew Johnny and me home from France in a stripped down bomber. Neither one of us have any idea why the Army suddenly ripped us out of a Paris hospital. We'd been under fancy treatment, me for my shoulder and Johnny for his punctured lung. See, only high priority cargo rides a bomb rack all by itself father but... why we rated it, nobody could or even wouldn't tell us. When we climbed out to La Guardia, field we find a welcoming committee... with a lieutenant colonel from Public Relations instead from the Medical Corps. He was in a large sweat because of the two hours late... due the heads winds over the Atlantic. Bolen Fields, Washington, DC was fog then... but he hoped maybe they'd hold the limited more than 10 minutes. All the way to the Penn station I tried to feel out the good desk colonel... but he'd only grin, they'd actually held the Limited for us. Somebody sure enough wanted us in Washington but now. By the time we rolled into Philly, I was feeling Ok. Houses with roofs on them and women with nylons kids that eat. Can't believe it. Say, when you get on again as a professor in some college... and I'm back running my cabs in St. Louis... send me up a problem in algebra once in a while, will you? - Blond or brunette? - Redhead in a sloppy-Joe sweater. I think you're a great guy too Rip, if that's what this conversation is about. - Even in the USA, this world. - Listen soldier, you don't have to... Maybe I'll be dropping at the St. Louis now for a drink. - Careful you don't swallow that pin. - Got to know nothing good ever really ends. You dreaming about that blond again. I was remembering how her low voice is, how bad her grammar was at first. - And how you taught her English. - Yeah. And my life is much simpler, I was just thinking about that girl we saw at the bar. - Want to blow? You don't even know her. - What difference is that make? - Beside, she looked sad. - Well, I'm the comforting type. Johnny, why don't you get rid of the grief you got for that blond whoever she is? Every mile we go you sweat worse with the same pain. Didn't I tell you all females are the same with their faces washed. Say brother, we're dynamite. Transportation priority 1A, that's how the big boy, the president himself travels. - How you get that? - Right out the silver leaf. You'll have us both before a general court pulling stuff like that. - At ease, sergeant. - Put them back Rip. What's eating you professor? What's wrong with a little reconnaissance? Confidential, this ought to tell us something. - Give me those. - Ok, colonel. Just a minute sergeant Drake, isn't that my blouse? Yeah, how come, sergeant? And where you get those papers? What goes on here? Come on, speak up sergeant. Sir, the papers felt, your blouse dropped. Oh, the captain said to hang it of the neck. What's the matter with your mouth? What's that? Top personal secret, never lets go of it. 6-2 and even, he swallows it, his senior sorority pin. I was having a peek at your papers, when the sergeant rescued them. You mean to say captain, you come and went through my papers? The war is over, we want to know where we going and why? We don't like secrets. Thank you sergeant. Well I, yes, I should've known better than try to hold back anything from... men who operated the way you have, back in the enemy lines. I just wanted to give General Steele... the pleasure of seen your faces when you heard it. - Steele, Cold Steele? - Yeah. Was largely his doing that your recommendation went through. - For Johnny to get the congressional? - The congressional? There were certain errors or omissions in your report of the incident captain. Well, don't tell me the guys in Washington refused to Ok? Those guys captain finally decided to award the Congressional Medal of honor to sergeant Drake... and the Distinguished Service Cross to the officer who was with him. Now, how's that bud? The congressional, with a baby blue ribbon. Won't you look pretty standing up there with the head man? Maybe he'll even let you sit on his piano. - With the newsreels grinding. - In Technicolor. What's the gripe? I'd say that's the best they've got, there isn't anymore. You shouldn't have done it Rip. Sometimes chum you go soft headed, I'd like to see any blond do that to me. - She's got you crazy, what's the gimmick? - Basic grammar. - I'll bet she talks beautifully by now. - Think so? I think you got a look like the first time you jumped. Oh no, look kid, if it's trouble what... - Yeah, we had some, didn't we? - Yeah. - Not like this though. - Ah, quit living inside there. - You can't tell me... - I can tell you. - I just don't want any medal. - Is that all you don't want? - Captain Murdock? - On the hoof son. The Camera boys like to get a couple of shots of you and sergeant Drake. Could you come out on the platform? It only stop here for 5 minutes. Such a city of brotherly love? That's what New Yorkers call it, they don't live here. I'm also love son. Come on hero. And that's an order. Say, Washington hasn't released a story, can you tell me what gives? Sergeant Drake's story. I'm not, you see Johnny here... Johnny? Johnny? Sergeant Drake... Johnny. I didn't like that salute. There was something final about it. And I got it alright why Johnny had taken a powder. He faked a birth certificate to enlist John Joseph Preston, eh? The Yale pin said so, all I needed was a telephone. Oh, sorry gorgeous, I didn't see what you look like. I'd let you have it, only it's long distance. Yale University. Oh hello Yale? Give me your top man there whatever you call him. What college? Yale, of course. Ok, so it's a university, how would I know? I just run a place of taxi cabs. Yeah, one of my men found some kind of a... pin with a name of a Yale man on it, class of 1940. I want his address so I can return it to him. Thanks, lovely. With all do respect General, if you won't authorize... me to go after him, I'm afraid I'll have to go anyway. Yes sir, yes sir, I have a pretty good idea where he is... But we don't want Intelligence messing around in this. I regret to say sir, yes. That's right sir, I refuse. The last address Yale had for John Joseph Preston... class of 1940, was a town I'd never heard of. Welcome to Gulf City Mr.Murdock. Murdock? Oh yes sir, there's a room already reserved for you. No, must be another Murdock, nobody knew I was coming. Warren Murdock, that was the name sir and from St. Louis. No, I don't get it but I'll take it. It's our best suite sir, the gentleman who telephoned insisted. - Oh? Oh, then it's for me alright. - Front boy. Geronimo, the paratroopers' jump call, it's Johnny alright. After what we've been through we could read each other's minds. He knew I'd want to help and trail and he'd seen me sneak... to look at the back of the scene his society pin. Will call later Johnny phone message said, that was 10 hours ago. How long is later? What to do in a hot wind, smelling of night blooming jasmine except wait and sweat? And prime the body to sweat some more, in the meantime a phone directory might help. I'd never heard of Johnny speak of any relatives... but I was ready to try anything, even a 3rd cousin. Prendergast, Prescott, Prestwood. Stalled again, like a jeep on synthetic gas. 48 hours since he called and still no word. I pitched the Cardinals into the pennant with my old high school curb... and set the Red Sox down 4 to 3 in the World Series. And suddenly Johnny service record came to me like a photograph on my eye lenses. He'd enlisted October 11, 1943. Whatever jam he got himself in must've been just before that. And might've made the local newspapers. There it was father, all over page one. September 3, 1943, only five weeks before Johnny enlisted under the name of Drake. The rest was what you'd expect father, nationwide search for a fugitive... A Grand Jury murder indictment, search for Johnny go limps. Story dribbling off until it fell out of the paper. The newspaper files gave me a lot of answers... but there were still three things I had to find out. How could Johnny possibly be a murderer? Why he come back here where he was even hotter than the weather? And why, why not another word from him since that first call? Listen honey child... Haven't you all got any local radio news programs in this fair city of yours? Because all I get is commercials and a lot of that apple pan-dowdy. Not until 12 o'clock. Well, thank you kindly ma'am. I thought I'd turned the juice off buddy, you know the way you do sometimes. But I only flipped the button to put it in the police call band. Car 42 reporting in. Car 42 reporting in. Broken safety railing on Tarpon Springs Turnpike was due to auto smash. There's a burned sedan in the ravine. Body in it, charred beyond identification. Been there two days, send morgue wagon. - Car 42 reporting, got it? - Ok 42, got it. Two days ago, that would be the night Johnny was to call me, maybe he? I was getting desperate, down a wild chance but it might be a lead. There were one place in town where I could find out for sure. Evening. I was wonder if I could take a look in your icebox? Looking for somebody special? A missing persons, thought I've to take his squint just start. - Who's missing? What's the name? - What's it to you? - Homicide Squad. - Lieutenant Kincaid. - Oh, I thought maybe you was a morgue buff. - Buff? A fan, a nut like those guys that chase fires. I didn't know Homicide men hang out in the morgue. - Just where you come from mister? - Out of town. - Frisco. - Now, how did you know? The accent, I can spot any accent. - What's the name? - Jet Wilson, Charlie Wilson, I met him on the train. He kept babbling about suicide but I thought I talked him of it. We would've dinner last night but he didn't show and no word since. - Yeah? I meant your name. - I gave all that to Missing Persons. - Ok mister. Ok, I'll handle this Willie. - Thanks Willie. - Fished this one out of the Gulf. - Pass. - Hit and run. - No, he's too old. - What did this Wilson looked like? - Medium. - Medium what? - Medium young, medium height, medium weight. Very illuminating. You can call him medium what's left of him, barracuda got the rest. - That's the lot. - All the rest empty? Yeah. You're not doing much business, are you? For the one cool spot in town. Fact is one just came in but it don't fit you boy. - How would you know? - You said suicide. I was guessing. Yeah, well this one came out of a car smash, you don't want to see him. - I might as well blanket the field. - He's own mother won't know him. - He's as crisp as bacon. - I can stand it if you can. Ok. He was like a lump of charcoal Johnny's build. It might be Johnny, it might not. No hardware on him? Wilson had a wristwatch. Not even a small change, he'd been cleaned as though somebody didn't want him identified. The only thing my boys picked up was a hunk of melted gold, like a tooth. Only it's too big for a tooth and it's got some black stuff on it. Black enamel and gold, Johnny's senior society pin. So Johnny is taken his last jump. - What's it look like to you? - Gold bullet? You kidding? Hey, it's an idea, the newspaper boys will go for that take. Once the electric fan in Kincaid's head... started turning, he'd check with Missing Persons and find out I'd... never been there but I wasn't worrying about that. I was thinking, now I won't have to say goodbye to Johnny. I remembered him in Berlin, crazy song he always sang. I used to say, you drive me nuts with it. Yeah. Why used to say to him... well, let's just say I remembered Johnny, laughing, tough and lonesome. Let's just say that. But I knew all at once I had a job. They don't give out the Congressional Medal to dead guys wanted for murder... but he was going to get it even if he got it on his grave. And I was going after whoever tried to gyp him out of it. Why should anybody kill Johnny? Because he knew too much? Because he hadn't shot Chandler and maybe knew who did? There was a photograph in the Gulf City Statesman. Louis Ord, a waiter at the Sanctuary Club. He was a witness at the Chandler inquest but reluctant when the papers set. Maybe he wouldn't help any, but you got to start somewhere. And he'd be fine. Mr. Louis Ord would be fine, just dandy. I felt like a fight father, I felt like a fight. How many sir? - You alone friend? I've a small table. - The bar is good enough, thanks. It looked like feeding time at the zoo. All you needed it was money to start with and bicarbonate of soda to finish with. - What will be sir? - Rye and water. - Plain water? - Yeah. Here you are sir. - Oh, come here sweetheart. - Yes sir? - Didn't you used to be a waiter here? - Why, yes sir Louis Ord, 45, single? I, I seem to know your face sir but the name... Remember a guy named Johnny? In this business you meet lots of Johnnies sir. You were a witness against this one once. He acted like a mine had gone off under his feet. I hadn't seen a guy look that scared since jump training. - Who are you? - The name is Murdock. - Captain Murdock? - How you know that? Johnny is told me about you captain.- Skip the captain, you know where Johnny is now? He's been holed up at my place, that is he was until 2 days ago. I ain't seen him since. - I'm worry. - Who else has he seen since he's been here? No one, that is, except her. - You mean the Chandler doll? - Yeah. What's she like? Oh, she's tops, not only with him, with everyone. - When he last see her? - Oh, I don't know that but... 2 nights ago, just before he left my place... he gave me a letter for you, in case you show up. What you waiting for? Give it to me. - Oh, come on, where is it? - Here. - Come on, hand it over, give it to me. - Go on and give it to him. Not here, tomorrow morning in your hotel. - I have that table for you now friend. - I said I didn't want a table. Sorry sir, my mistake. There was something about that big lug I didn't like, maybe his calling me friend. - Hello Louis. - Good evening Mrs. Chandler. - A Ramos gin fizz? - Nobody can make them the way you can. Thank you... very much. Cinderella, with a husky voice. Where we met? In another guy's dreams, you still sing that song. - Who are you? - Rip Murdock. Where is Johnny, you know? You haven't told me whether you still sing that song he liked... you remember it, don't you? Excuse me Mrs Chandler... the boss said to ask you as a special favor, will you sing that... song you made the big hit with when you were in the show here? - I couldn't, not possibly. - As a favor to him, he said. Yeah, I'd like to hear it. Alright but just that one. I'll take that table now friend, for two. I hated every part of her, but I couldn't figure her out yet. I wanted to see her the way Johnny had, I wanted to hear that song of her through Johnny's ears. Maybe she was all right and maybe Christmas comes in July. But I didn't believe it. - Have you seen Johnny since he got back? - Yes. But where is he now if you know? I've been frantic for two days. - He was frantic for three years. - Was he? In spite of the fact you testified against him. If you know Johnny then you must know he understands, I had to testify. - When you see him last? - Day before yesterday. He was to call and let me know if he'd made arrangements... to go to Mexico or South America so I could join him but he never called. And since staring at my phone... I've been out of my mind, finally I had to get out... and go someplace just to keep me going crazy. - I just saw him. - Tonight? - About 10 o'clock. - Where? Ladies and gentlemen, we've a special treat for you tonight. As a great favor, the little lady who not so long ago was our star attraction... and was a guest here tonight... has agreed to give us once again the song she made the sensation of the South. Ladies and gentlemen Mrs. Coral Chandler.

You and Johnny, you were together all the time, weren't you? We fought together, two men team. And spent all your leaves together, London Paris, Rome. Me with a gal always, him without one, just a picture of you in his eyes. Where is he now? Won't you tell me where did you see him? - Let's dance. - Please, I want to know. I wanted her in my arms when I told her. My right hand on her spine would feel the shock if there was any. She tested pure so far... but so did another girl I knew, One is right up to the dollar point. And wasn't 4 million either. - Still wear the same perfume, don't you? - Tell me where you saw him. - She wears jasmine, he said. - Please. Used to called you Dusty... was sort of a love name you had between the two of you, wasn't it? Tell me where you saw him. On a slab in the morgue, burned to a crisp. I think we'd better sit down. Her whole body had gone soft disgusted when I slugged her with it. But I kept thinking, she has to know something. Take a couple of deep drags. Thanks. I won't do that again. Tell me what happened, please tell me everything, I promise... - You not feeling ill Mrs. Chandler? - No, no, I feel fine, thanks. Isn't often we have the esthetic pleasure of seeing Mrs. Chandler dance. It's a pity you stopped. Mr. Murdock, this is Mr. Martinelli, who owns all this. Mr. Murdock is an old friend of mine from out of town. Any friend of Mrs. Chandler's is must welcome here. I'm afraid I don't sing. Perhaps you'd like to try a little roulette. It's probably less than wise for me to tell you... but the house is having a streak of bad luck this evening. Mrs. Chandler doesn't feel like gambling. Oh, I'm all right, really I am. I'd like to. You too sir? I'll just watch, roulette wheels have a way of running over me. I was walking into something father, We were going to gamble hot and cold, win or lose. He hadn't asked her to, he told her she had to, it was an order but why? And I didn't like the feeling I had about her. The way I wanted to put my hand on her arm. The way I kept smelling that jasmine in her hair. The way I kept hearing that song she'd sung. Yeah, I was walking into something alright. Oh, Krause, have fresh drinks brought upstairs for Mrs. Chandler and Mr. Murdock. And some of those pate de foie gras sandwiches that Pierre makes so well. Real pate from Paris, pre-Ar. Right away sir. Number 11, black. Two stacks please. Make your bets ladies and gentlemen. Make your bets, your bet. No more bets, no more. That way you'll get rid of it fast. - It's a system I use. - You ever try throwing it out the window? Number 13, black. Place your bets ladies and gentlemen. Place your bets. Place your bets. No more bets ladies and gentlemen, nore bets, no more. - Eleven then seven, what next? - I repeat, first one then the other. It won't work Dusty, you got the right numbers in the wrong game. Number 4, black. Nothing on 4. She lost fast and heavy. Maybe it was her way of easing off the pain of Johnny. But I suspected there was more to it, I decided to find out. - How much is Mrs. Chandler in the rim for? - Sixteen thousand. Let's see what I can do with the same numbers. - Did you ride in on the killing? - Her horse stumbled, give me the 7-11 dice. Mr. Murdock, they're all 7-11 dice, it depends only on the talent of the player. - Not the luck? - I was returning your compliment. You shoot honestly, we give you honest dice. Open up the table. You won't mind if I watch, I hope. Not at all, if you think you can take it. - What's the house limit? - For Mrs. Chandler, no limit. We shoot 2000. - Seven. - Seven the winner. - The 4000 rides. - Ad infinitum, if you wish. Eleven the winner. 7-11, your system Dusty, once more and we're even. - Better stop with what we have. - No, we'll get even. - The house will change the dice. - That's your privilege friend. There you are, that enough to squares you with the house. I trust you don't think there's anything wrong with the dice? I never think when I gamble Martinelli, I just feel and I feel snake eyes. Krause, give Mr. Murdock back the dice he had before. Now sir, I'd be delighted to have you roll for any part or all of the 16,000. Let's say all of it. - Four. - A difficult point Mr. Murdock. What man has done, Murdock can do. - Please Rip, I'm 16,000 ahead. - Bother you? No, a solid winning by a player... every now and then is the best advertising for any casino. - Can't we have a nightcap? - It's your money. We'll have it in my office. If it's all the same to you friend, I'd like that particular pair for a souvenir. Much obliged. With all that fall in money on you, I'd better see you home. Snake eyes again. I'm afraid Krause is a fool. Ever since me cutting him in on the profits was mistake. He's becoming greedy. You don't mind, I'll keep these to remind me never to stretch my luck. A judicious principle. I gather Mr. Murdock that you've been around, as the saying is. - East St. Louis is around enough. - Ah, St. Louis. In what business were you, may I ask? I owned a place of taxi cabs, but they got sunk at Pearl Harbor. Oh, then undoubtedly you know Al Baretto? How come you know Al? Were you ever in St. Louis? Many times, although my headquarters were in Detroit. I thought AI's Detroit friends were all mobsters. - Where's Mike? - Why... He mixed them sir but he got busy so I brought them up. - Ramos gin fizz madam. - Thank you. Our very best sir, Mr. Martinelli's private stock. - Louis. - Coming sir. I got it all right, something in the drink. Also my private stock, that's all. To the beauties of St. Louis. - You disapprove of the toast sir? - I'm trying to think of a better one. I was trying to think alright, if I didn't drink this, all Detroit... may fall in on Louis for tipping me off and if I did... But I kept remembering, Louis been Johnny's friend here, maybe his only friend. - I needed Louis alive. - We await your pleasure. Geronimo. A lovely word, with the added charm for me of being meaningless. - A St. Louis expression? - No, just one I picked up. Your expressions have the Baretto flavor, almost medieval, baroque. Mobster for instance, as applied to me, is more colorful than accurate. I've always had a preference for legitimate enterprises. - With a gambling racket on the side. - Oh, scarcely a racket Mr.Murdock. More for my own amusement than for profit, as you've some reason to know. Gambling is technically illegal to be sure... but the whole city is aware of it and approves. My house encourages tourists, pays large taxes... Coming out of it was like after being tapped on the button. Everything foggy, a fur on my throat, an anchor on my head and ringing in my ears. Rip, this is Coral, Dusty, what happened? - Oh, I don't know, don't you know? - I just woke up in my garage. It's a great place to wake up. Mr. Martinelli is a fine... - Remind me to put him to sleep sometime. - My head is splitting. Take a look in your bag and see if you still got your money. Just a minute. - Oh, murder. - What you say? I said murder, I just sat up. - The money is all here Rip. - It is? Then I can't understand why he slugged us both. - What's your phone number Dusty? - Surf 3181. I'll call you back, I got company. It was Louis. His neck was broken father, little by little my brain began to unscramble. Louis Johnny's letter, that was the joker. Then Martinelli was tied in to Johnny's death. He'd found out about Johnny's letter and figured it put... the finger on him so he'd silenced Louis too. And Louis' body was to block me out of the play with a murder rap. I had to get rid of Louis some way and fast before the cops around the following up... Martinelli's next play, an anonymous tip to pay me a call. It's locked, should I kick it in? No, it may have been a phoney tip. I don't know where it came from. - Oh, so it's you, the smart guy from Frisco. - You better than I thought were. - How you ever locate me? - Mind if we take a look around Mr. Murdock? Mind? Why should I mind? What's a little sleep? I'm not interrupting you trained thought... would you mind telling me what you looking for? Maybe we're looking for that guy you was looking for down the morgue Charlie Wilson. Mister, just what do you know about that burned corpse? Just as much as you do, nothing. You heard that squad car reporting about a car smashed. That's why the high class rent a shop with a police call-band. - You knew the guy had been taken for a ride. - You guys murder me. Just happens that's the only radio the shop had for rent. I'd bet. You know, if you'd stop playing smart, I might be able to help you. Where you get the head? Up the Sanctuary Club? If you're looking for Easter bunnies you're a day early. - And you had a row with Louis Ord up there. - Who's he? - What was you threaten him about? - Why don't you ask him? Don't think I won't. Tell me lieutenant, you don't object to my going back to bed, do you? I got a habit of sleeping late morning, very often right after 6. How long you known Coral Chandler? Sometimes I think all my life. Mighty a nice thing you did, getting her even. I always get even lieutenant. Snap the light off when you go out, I'll leave the door unlocked. - You can walk in any time. - Come on Casey. Say, if I had the boy pick up my laundry this morning, when can I expect it back? Wednesday, eh? When does the laundry pick it up? What time this afternoon? Oh, fine. Well, send the boy up at 8 and while you're on the wire, get me Surf 3181. Yeah, thanks. Oh, Hello Dusty, yeah. Yeah, my company is gone, I'm alone, I think. Tell me, what the world look like to you when you first opened your eyes? Head like a balloon, eh? With what? Oh, yeah. What kind of a taste you have? Sour molasses? Maybe the DDT. I don't know, I never drank any before. How's you stomach feel? What you mean am I checking up on you? Of course I am. I forgot to tell you, I don't trust anybody, especially women. Well look Dusty, I got a job for us. What time is the top rush hour for lunch in this hotel? It is? Alright, then park your car in the garage at exactly 1 o'clock and meet me in the lobby. You got it? Alright, see you then. Look honey, how soon can you get me Operator 19, St. Louis? That's my girl. Hi Al, this is Rip. Oh sure, I'm great. Did you get my phone message this morning? No, not yet, not for a while, I get a little unfinished business down here first. Somebody who used to be your Detroit competition, calls himself Martinelli. Yeah, in spades. Thank you, dig me up the name of a good man down here? McGee, 25 Palmetto Street. Ok pal, you're a pal. And I'll be seeing you. Yeah, when I got aces back to back, so long. Lieutenant Kincaid? Call for Lieutenant Kincaid. - Calling Lieutenant Kin... - Hey boy, Ok. - Lieutenant Kincaid? - Who wants me? Headquarters sir, on the phone. Hello lieutenant? Chief wants to talk to you, will you hold the wire? Well, at last. You said 1 o'clock, where were you? Where you going? The dining room is over there. Hello? Hello? What's the matter with you that can't you say a word? Sure hello. Might be easy to drive if I knew where we going. Oh, anyplace out of town where we can eat. Not to speak of why. You're an inquisitive little gal, aren't you? There's a place at Flamingo Beach but that's too far out, I have to be back at 3. Oh, stand him up, you're with me and after dark and then some. - Isn't a man, it's my hairdresser. - Oh, that makes it rugged. Oh Rip please, my hair is a mess after last night. But why won't you let it down, maybe I'll let mine down too. I can't understand why Martinelli put that stuff in our drinks. Is he thinks you're working for that St. Louis gangster? If he know Al Bareto he know I'm not one of the mob. Just a guy who own a place of taxi cabs and sat in on a stud game once in a while. Well, then I don't see why... You know the trouble with women is they ask too many questions. They should spend all their time just being beautiful. - And let the men do the worrying. - Yeah. You know, I'm thinking women ought to come capsule size, about four inches high. When a man goes out an evening he just puts her in his pocket... and take her along with him and that way he knows where she is. He gets to his favorite restaurant he... put her on the table and let her run around another coffee cup... so his swaps a few lies with his pal without danger of interrupt. And when it comes that time in the evening when he wants her full size and beautiful... just waves his hand and there she is, full size. Why, that's the most conceited statement I've ever heard. But if she starts to interrupt, he shrinks her back to pocket size and puts her away. I understand. What you're saying is, women are made to be loved. - Is that what I'm saying? - Is it, it's a confession... if a woman may drive you out of your mind, that you wouldn't trust her. Because you couldn't put her in your pocket, you get all mixed up. I don't understand what does it, what did it for Johnny? The trouble is Rip that it happened to Johnny, it didn't happen to me. At least not as intensely. - That's what he was afraid of. - I was going with him because... he was the nicest person I'd ever met. Because I'm lonely, you're right about women being made for love. But what happens Rip, when it never comes the way you want it? Like music that never reaches a pitch? What do you do? Go on singing songs and drinking Ramos gin fizzes? Yeah, I can see why Johnny loved you. - And why he couldn't reach you. - Oh, I loved him Rip, I don't know. It's just well, there's some people you feel you can talk to. They come along, sit beside you in your car. Only, the funny thing is, it's, it's never happened before. That's crazy to say to... - Looks like you're the one that's mixed up. - But I'm not. Get back in my pocket. Say, do me a favor, will you park over there for a while, I... - I kind of like to be alone with the lady. - Yes sir. Careful for what you say, I'm the marrying type. When you used to work for Martinelli, did he take a lot of stuff home with him at night? Briefcase, papers, stuff like that or did he leave them locked up in his office? I don't know, except he kept my contract in his office. Why? Well, last night, Louis the bar man had a letter for me that Johnny gave him. - A letter? - Yeah. What did it say? I don't know, I didn't get it Martinelli did. How do you know? When your phone call woke me up at 4 o'clock... in the morning, Louis was in my room, lying on the other bed, with a broken neck. - Oh, Rip. - Yeah. I'm a guy that likes to get his mail. Rip, if Martinelli does have it, he would've destroyed it by now. No, I don't think so, he'd want to read it first. Johnny would've written it in code, we have a Unit Code in out Company. Is my guess that Martinelli is still trying to figure it out. Anyway, I'm going after it. - Not back there? - Yeah. I just had my friend Baretto on the phone. He gave me the name of a safe expert here. He was so good at it, the law took a little slice out of his life. He's retired now, living right here in this town. - Oh, Rip but what good is? - I don't think Johnny killed your husband. - Why do you say that? - Because I knew him like my own birthmark. Rip... there, there's something I didn't tell the coroner because Johnny wouldn't let me. I was right there when it happened. Johnny was afraid they'd somehow and blame me, tie us both up, you know how they do. Ex-nightclub singer, young college professor's in love with her... then murder her husband, but... - that wasn't the way it was. - What way was it? Stuart had always been crazy jealous, that night, he was drunk too. When we got home, he started hitting me and jabbing a gun into me. He was mad enough to kill me and I was terrified and the suddenly... Johnny came into the room, he'd followed us home from the club. He took the gun from Stuart or was trying to, I don't know what happened... but it seemed to go off right in my ear. I passed out and when I came to... Johnny was kissing me. That was the last time I saw him until he came back, two days ago. I remember he said goodbye, I think he was crying. - You don't believe me, do you? - Yeah. Yeah, sure, I believe you but I still want that letter. And let's get out of this lobster trap, we both need some salt air. They say salt is antiseptic. - Rip, what's the matter? - Well, is something the matter? - Yesterday you called me Dusty, today... - Johnny used to call you that, didn't he? Yes, what would you like to call me? - I'll have to think about that. - Yes, you think of that Rip. I want you to. We'd better get back to town. I couldn't stand there looking at her, I had to keep moving. Her story about Johnny sounded real, I'd buy it for now, on approval, as the dolls say. Only maybe I was buying a lot more than that and didn't know it. McGee, 25 Palmetto Street. It was a nice little house, he'd probably paid 4, 5000 for it before houses went up. From all I hear, it would probably bring 15 Gs by now. And here was this guy McGee, all nicely reformed. Chances are, it's the first house he ever lived in his life. When this is over drop up and see him father, I think you two get along. But I had something else on my mind right then. What it be mister? Phone company, checking long distance calls... you get one from St Louis a little while ago? - Hiya Murdock? - Ok McGee. Step right in. - Oh, McGee, this is Mike. - Hiya Mike? I'm fine now. - What a nice little place you got here. - Well, it's kind of messed up right now. Joe, that's my kid, he brought this junk back from Japan. Joe took this off a Nip colonel. Ain't it a pip? Almost cut your head off, didn't I? Joe says these babies here are soft and low. - Those are German. - That's what Joe said, how you know? If I were you I'd turn them into Army ordinance, you start coughing to hard... with on those things in you hand, there'll be nothing left... but the gold in your teeth, ever done mouth. Holy smoke. That Joe, collecting stuff like that, it used to be just guns. - What sort of trick is it you got in mind? - Small wall type. My family bible. When you spot your job, holler. - There, Am I right? - That looks right. That one? It's a pipe, what's the layout? Martinelli's private office, the Sanctuary Club. I was willing to turn a trick for old time's sake because you're a friend of AI's. I'd cut it right up to here for Al but I ain't souping no safe for Martinelli's. I've built up a legitimate business here, with a positive future. Forget it, Murdock. Wash it out of your mind. No grease either, wouldn't do me any good with sand in my mouth. But if it's a pipe such a pipe, couldn't you show Mr. Murdock how to do it? How you like that? Murdock, you got something there. I have a letter I want to get, and she wants me to get it. Lady, there was a time I could've used you. I'll show you how in five minutes flat, come on. - Where next? - Where is Martinelli live? Crescent Beach, why? Now, suppose you drive around, show me the sights and wind up there after dark. You know, the letter wouldn't be at Crescent Beach. Maybe not but while I'm at the club, I want Martinelli at police headquarters with the cops sweating him. I don't see the connection. Oh, nobody can, without opening the back of your car. - The back? - The truck compartment. Louis Ord's body is back there. - How long you've been driving? - I didn't see the signal, not till too late. - It was my fault officer. - Let's see your driver's license. I just told her something that startled her. It must be here, I know it is. It better be, unless you want to come along to the station house. - It isn't here, it just isn't here. - Keep your head Mike. Well, I guess we're hooked, she must've left it in some other bag. That's the standard answer mister. On our way to the station house, you mind stopping by the mayor's office? - We got a date with His Honor. - Oh? He's your pal I'd suppose. Never saw him in my life. He told me on the phone if I got Mrs. Chandler there by 4 o'clock he'd marry us. That's what I'd just told her when we went through that stop signal. Yeah? - Is that a fact? - And I hardly know it. Ok, get along with you. Hey, wait a minute. - What did you say lady? - I said yes. That was close. That was a funny thing to say. What was the matter with it? He fell for it, didn't he? Yes, he found it easy to believe. Martinelli's beach house fronted on the Gulf, on of those big places... he probably built with hot priorities and cold dice. Alright, get out quick. They go for it? They said they'd send a police car up here right away to investigate. - What time you got? - 5 to 9. Hello? Hotel Southern? This is Mr. Murdock. Give me the manager, will you honey? Well, this was going to be it. If I got that letter, was all I needed. If everything rolls on rubber, I'll be at your place by 11. - Can't I wait for you down the road? - Not so, this is operation solo. I don't want you hurt. By the way, where is Surf 3181? The penthouse at The Gables. Rip, you won't take any fool chances, will you? Not any fooler than I'm taking now. Doing that. - Be careful. - Sure. It's funny how loud crickets sound and the way you feel. But it's funny too how a kiss stay on, the way you can still taste it. Martinelli was still up there, maybe the phone call hadn't worked. But it had, all I had to do was wait. He was right on schedule. I was thinking, go ahead sucker, beat it to your big beach home. This is the same gag you pulled on me last night, it's even the same corpse. Only thing is missing is a sledgehammer highball and a pair of snake eyes dice. There was one joker though, what if he left a goon around to watch his office? Here I was again, back to the scene of the TNT highball... with the pretty girl camouflaging the safe. Martinelli should've been in a hurry. He hadn't even turned the radio off. Not that I don't like music, but I work better in silence. I'm crazy about you sweetheart but move over. She moved over father, the safe was wide open. Martinelli really had hauled freight in a hurry. After all my trouble to get Martinelli out of here, this was going to be dandy. I kept thinking it had to be here somewhere. Up to now, everything had gone like grief. Sure he had the letter alright, he'd been working on it. But he hadn't gotten very far with his homework. Was doing research on that letter but good, the Leising Book of Codes. Here was the real merchandise, I recognized Johnny's writing. Martinelli Martinelli. Then suddenly, I got a whiff of jasmine, for a second I thought it might've been... It was like going out the jump door, I was falling through space. Count sucker and pull the ring. One thousand, two thousand, then lights. The ground batteries had picked me up, I tried to side slip the chute but I couldn't. The lights got brighter and brighter, they were blinding me. He's coming to. Go ahead and make with the music friend, we love it. What's the letter say friend? - Tell us about it friend. - Quiet Krause. As I haven't yet solved the code, I must ask you to repeat the message in the letter. Hadn't read it yet. I just started to when you sapped me. You place me in an extremely distasteful position Mr. Murdock. By nature I'm a gentleman, truly gentle. Brutality is always revolted me as a weapon of the witless. Like your friend Baretto. Yes and Krause here. Although I'd admit that Krause's inclinations are more psychopathic than intelligent. He suffered an injury to his brain once and ever since then... If you make me leave you to his quiet whims, I will never forgive you. Go take a flying jump for yourself. I'd formed a higher opinion of your ability to make decisions Mr. Murdock. The rest is to dance time friend. You like music friend? I like music. I love music. I like all kinds of music. Maybe he'll talk to you now I think. Prop him up in the chair facing the wall. I told you can't bear the sight of your handiwork. - And don't put that thing away, in case. - In case is more music? There he is, all tuned up for you. That's better. You're a stubborn man Mr. Murdock. Your whole attitude, I find thoroughly aggravating. What time is it? That seems a little beside the point. - It happens to be 10:45 or thereabouts. - You're licked Martinelli. Quarter to 11, manager, Hotel Southern... will phone me here. - Don't fall for that. - Shut up. Yes Mr. Murdock? Do go on, I'm must interested. He's just making with the mouth. Wrong, as usual. Yes? This is Mr. Martinelli. No Sanderson Mr.Murdock is not here, I haven't seen him tonight. That's the right answer, now you're really taken care of. - In what manner, if I may ask? - Sanderson is got a letter I wrote. If I'm not back at the hotel by 11:15 to collect it myself... he's to call the police department and turn it over to them. Are you going for that garbage? And just what does this fascinating letter contain Mr. Murdock? Evidence. Evidence that a couple of cheap guns named Martinelli and Krause... knocked off Johnny Preston on the Tarpon Springs Road. Correct me if I'm wrong. Take Mr. Murdock to the Hotel Southern. Walk arm in arm with him, like the best of friends... with your hand on the gun in your pocket. Go directly to the elevators, our bruised guest's hat roll down over his face. Mr .Murdock will call the manager and tell him to bring the letter up to his room. Station Mr. Murdock in the bathroom with the door open. He will call out to Sanderson to give you the letter. Bring the letter back here together with Mr. Murdock, is that clear? As glass. Of course, there wasn't any letter father. I was just kicking on the first down and praying for a break. Which it didn't look like there was any coming up. Hold there you two. You Murdock, I've been chasing you for six blocks. - Oh hello lieutenant. - What run over you? Shake hands with my friend Krause. Lt. Kincaid, of the Homicide Squad. Haven't I seen you around? Frisk him copper, he's got a gun. The other guy Murdock, follow him. But they didn't get me. Not yet anyway. - Then this man Martinelli, it's... - Yes Martinelli. But as I've been telling it to you, I've been thinking, I'm not so sure. I remember there was a whiff of jasmine just before I was knocked out. Maybe, maybe it was her. Suddenly I got a feeling I know it was. Jasmine. You're in a bad way my boy, let me get you something. - No, thanks anyway. - A bit of brandy, at least. I think if I ask father Donlin, he might find he has some right there in the rectory. Well for, for medicinal purposes of course, you understand. It won't take me a minute, I'll get it for you. Oh, before I see father Donlin, is just one little thing I'd like to ask you. Just how we going to handle this? The two of us, I mean. Of course my boy, you want me in this with you, don't you? Don't you? By all that's holy, he don't. Rip, what have they done to you? Come closer and you can see. Come on, closer. There, that's about right. Get me a drink. Tell me what happened darling. I heard of a girl once, kissed a guy and stabbed him in the back at the same time. Rip? And I heard of another girl, kissed a guy and blackjacked him. Had the smell of jasmine in her hair. In Martinelli's office, all around me and behind me, just before the lights went out. And when I woke up, they turned the radio on and played music. Mr. Krause likes music, you like music honey? Was the window open in Martinelli's office? Go ahead, why don't you tell me the story about... the guy with the dream stuck up with a young professor...? The smell of jasmine is very strong in Martinelli's office when the windows is open. Ends up with something about his friend. Night blooming jasmine grows all through this part of the country. You think fast, don't you sweetheart? I ought to hate you for thinking a thing like that. But I can't. You can say anything, do anything. Oh Rip, what is a girl have to do with you? - Turn inside out to make you see? - You know, you do awful good. I came here to... go ahead, put Christmas in you eye and keep your voice low. Tell me about paradise and all the things I'm missing. I haven't had a good laugh since before Johnny was murdered. I'm not the type that tears do anything to. I'm the brass knuckles in the teeth to dance time type. It's no use with you, is it? Maybe the trouble is my name isn't Johnny and I never... taught college anyone and I don't appreciate the finer things of life. Like looking at a doll cry and taking the rap for a murder she committed. Johnny didn't tell you that. Why shouldn't he? Told me everything else, didn't he? You think I fell for that fancy tripe you gave me? Let's have a new story baby. I, I... - You killed him, why lie? - Because... You must believe me Rip, it was exactly like I told you. Except for a few changes. The struggle and the gun the only difference. It was in your hands not Johnny's when it went off. Yes, as that's the way Rip, your way, any way you want. I'm tired. I can't go on anymore. For 3 years now nearly 4 I was been threatened by the police. For months now ever since I came the Stuart's money... hounded every day for more and more money. I can stand Martinelli, but when you turn against me... How did he cut himself in on this? I had to talk to somebody when Johnny ran away. I wanted to tell the police that wasn't murder, that I did it. But I was afraid of what they do to me because I hadn't said so before. So you picked the worst hoodlum in town. He's always been nice to me, he gave me a job when nobody else would. And he knows about courts, thing like that. He said they'd convict me. And offered to get rid of the gun because the mark... on the bullet would prove that is the one that killed Stuart. - Strike one, stay with it. - I felt safe when I gave him the gun. I never thought about the fingerprints might still be on it. High, fast and on the inside, strike two. You can't hurt me anymore Rip, I'm going to call the police. Then your Johnny will be cleared. You don't care what happens to me. Well, neither do I, not anymore. There's the telephone, I'll miss you Mike. Larry? May I have police headquarters please? The chief I guess, I'd better speak to the chief. Hello? This is Mrs... Yes, who is it? Hello? Who did you say you were? I had to make you prove it the hard way, to ever really know. A few minutes ago, I didn't dare do this. Now I can Mike, I'm doing it so that you know I can. I never thought it could happen, I've been waiting so long for things to be like this. Rip, I lived by the train tracks. I was a carhop in Texas, a cigarette girl in a guys getting fresh. And then I sang and when Stuart Chandler came along I thought... But money wasn't the answer either, the answer is... Well, every time I had a chance to find out what it is... somebody is pushed me, pulled the whole thing out from under me. Oh, it's a blue, sick world Rip. I'm tired of it, tired of being tired. I want to go away, with you. I don't know if it makes sense or this makes sense. I love you, is that make sense? I said a while ago, you do awfully good. I'll always do awfully good, if you let me. My bet is on you kid. I'm wrong about you this time, I'm dead. You're not wrong about me Rip, I'll be your girl, I'll be anything you want me to be. We'll go anyplace in the world you want, begin to live. Be the kind of people who live. Rip... Say, I'm going to call the doctor. Just isn't natural anyone sleeping like that for 36 hours. When a woman frets about a man like you've been doing Miss Coral... she don't need a doctor, she needs a preacher, you got it bad. - Yes, I've got it bad. - Have a surprise for you. - He shaved and had breakfast. - Oh, why didn't you tell me? Well, I went in to put in ice bags only he wasn't there. I had cold fingers up my back Miss Coral till I looked in the bathroom. And there he was, his face all over soap. I just gave him the biggest breakfast a man ever had. So you can stop worrying, get that look out of your eyes. Have I got that look in my eyes? - If you have, keep it there. - Oh Rip, you're all right. Thanks to the fancy (?) my kind, never had a better night's sleep. - Two nights and a day. - Oh, that's what I call real Southern hospitality. I've been packing, all the time you slept. For our trip. Oh yes, that little trip to paradise. I remember something about that just before I... Are there any stops we have to make on the way? Washington, D.C. After that... Rip, do they have taxicabs where we going? What kind of a question is that? Maybe we won't have to touch any of my money. It's been nothing but trouble and I thought taxicabs are already your business and... I'd like to start out fresh, with you. Mike, I may be a sucker for saying this but... but from here on, it's a deal. Anything you want, any way you want to go. The two of us. Darling, where you going? While you're breaking camp I got to see an old pal. - Here? Who? - A guy named McGee. McGee? Why? - Mable. - I'm going Miss Coral, I'm going. Take it easy Mr. Rip. - Who are you? - A friend of Murdock's. Rip, where in the world have you been? I was afraid you're never coming back, what on earth kept... What you doing here? What's happ? Where's Rip? Don't get excited Mike, he's climbing up the back stairs, I come up the elevator. He figured the cops was following him. And they'd pick him up carrying this... - He'd get 1 to 10 in the big house for sure. - - What is it? A persuader and a couple of things you may call coaxers. Don't touch them now Mike, Murdock says them don't need much to start coaxing. - What is he want with anything like that? - I'm sorry Mike, this is where I get off. Pleased to have met you. He's got it cozy here, I'll say that, real cozy. You sure nobody tailed me here? Not a chance chum, I had you spotted all the way. - Ok, thanks chum. - Don't mention it pal, it perked up my whole day. You almost set? Oh Rip at last, that man scared me half to dead. - Where your bags? - Mable put them in the car. - Good, where's McGee's junk? - He won't let me touch it. What is it Rip? What you going to do? You know, after a little call on Martinelli, we're hitting the highway to the... next stop on the main line. We'll catch the Midnight there. Please Rip, let's go away right now. Drive to New Orleans and get a train there. Martinelli won't ever know what happened to us. I don't care about anything except I just want to be with you. And leave your fingerprints behind us on that gun? Do it my way. I'll never ask you anything again, I promise. Don't you push me darling. Chucking your fingerprints in the gun will be my last pitch Mike. Martinelli won't ever give up that gun and this time you might be killed. - That would be awful, wouldn't it? - Darling... You know, my trouble is I never should've let you sing that song. Is there any other reason why I shouldn't see Martinelli again? Please Rip, don't start being suspicious again, I told you. Yeah. Well then I'll need your help, I wouldn't ask for if I could swing it along. But I'll need you to open the back door to Martinelli's office. - Please Rip? - How about it? Alright, what can I do? Well, you can start by crawling out of my pocket. Getting full-size, big girl. - Chief said there was a phone call on... - Stretch copper. Of course nobody asked me but I'd call this kind of a dumb play Murdock. - Nothing personal lieutenant. - Chief just wants to talk to you. I'm booked for tonight, open that closet door. Alright, that's far enough, the cigar. Here, cut off a hunk of that curtain cord. Ok, lieutenant, drop them, behind your back. Down on your belly. - Cradle or what? - Cradle will do. Tie him up Mike and tight. Wrists first and then ankles and a few loops hooking them together. No, not that tight Mike, you know, homicide man has blood in his veins. That's more I can say for you Murdock. You know, I'm really a sweet guy lieutenant, once I get clear of this beach... I'll write you a letter about that burned body in the morgue. - Then they'll make you a captain. - Yeah, me and your friend Charlie Wilson. - Will that do? - Yeah, Ok. Now get Mable. What do you weigh lieutenant? - You got a watch? - Yes sir. Alright, sit down here till 12:30. Then let him out and give him his gun back. Don't worry Mabel, no one will do anything to you. I never worried since my first husband. Come back and see us again, Gulf City won't be the same without you two. They goes nothing kid, Geronimo. - Good evening Mrs. Chandler. - Good evening Joe. Are you sure it can't it wait? He's got a awful grouch on. You don't think I enjoy coming here, do you? Ok, it's your funeral. No, you can't handle this from Detroit I got to know if Baretto is in with him, do as I say. Shut that door, didn't he tell you I didn't wish to be disturbed? It's important. Told her you were busy boss, she said it wouldn't hold. - Well, what is it? - Murdock is down at the bar. - He followed me up here. - Murdock? Why didn't you buzz me? - I didn't see him boss. - But go down, get him, bring him up here. I'll go out this way, I don't want to see him. You have to jerk the bolt, sticks a little, unfortunately I found it wiser... Get them up. Beat it Mike, keep the motor running and the headlights on. Geronimo, Rip. You got the gun that killed Chandler, I want it and quick. - Who told you that? Not Coral? - On the button. She couldn't have told you about the gun unless you blackmailed out of her. - She has the shrewdness of a primitive... - He ain't nowhere down... - Kick it shut and lock it. - Yeah, sure. Move over. Turn around. Keep your right hand up and reach for your gun with your left and slow. One quick move and you waltz this time friend. Drop it on the floor. Kick it over toward the window. Now, turn around. Come a little closer. One more step. There, that's about right. How's the tempo of the music friend? Suit you? Here's a little melody for you, one of my favorite tunes. Now, I'll take that gun. Get over to the safe or wherever you keep it. The safe? My dear sir, I'm bewildered. Coral knows it wasn't in my safe. She went through everything in it after blackjacking you. - Start moving. - Simple logic, she'll tell you. If she hadn't taken Johnny's letter and If I still had it... would I have asked you to repeat it from memory instead of reading it myself? - Never mind to keep talk, get that gun. - Maybe I ought to tell you, she's my wife. She was my wife when she married Chandler and never was a divorce/. You're a sharp boy on the angles, aren't you? Baretto warned me you could spend almost every cushing. For a minute I almost believed you. Are you in love with her? That hadn't occurred to me. Tell me, did she mention anything about it was a blue world? Did she tell you she was a carhop once in Texas? What else? She wasn't. That was the story she gave old man Chandler. She came from the slums of Detroit, she was my girl in Detroit. You don't want that gun Mr. Murdock... unless you want to send our beautiful little Carol to the electric chair. Maybe I'll wipe her fingerprints off and put yours on just... to make sure you pay for burning Johnny down. The weakness of your position Mr Murdock... is that if you shoot me, obviously you... destroy the possibility of finding out where the gun is. You worry about your position, I'll take care of mine. Up friend. My position is equally clear. Since I was in it with her, that gun could send both Carol and me to the chair. As a choice and particularly under these circumstances, I find a bullet relatively... As a good last gesture... just shoot straight and make it fast, will you? All mushy outside and hard at the core, eh? I counted on that too. These babies are out of Tojo, by Hitler. Creeping Jelly, our own men used to called. Because they crawl and where they crawl, they burn... not quick like the chair, but slow and to the bone. Are you crazy? Either I get that Chandler gun or the slow broiler for you, even if we all cook. Your insane, can't you see I'm telling the truth? Old Chandler was son anxious, he not only he offered her marriage... he told her he had a bad heart and in six months she'd come to all his money. On the level friend. Then after the marriage, I found out through the doctor that the old man might live to be 80. That night Johnny Preston had a quarrel with Chandler. The people heard it... that was all I needed, I followed the old man home and shot him, with Carol's gun. But Preston kid thought she did it took the rap. Listen to me, if you don't believe this... how do you suppose I knew Johnny had come back to Gulf City? From her obviously. - But you knocked Johnny off. - I didn't mean him to get killed. I only told Krause to shadow him, but Krause is an idiot as well as a coward. Would I admit all this if I were lying? Maybe, maybe not, it's a pretty story but I still want that gun. I haven't got it, I swear. - How would you like yourself? Medium-rare? - His desk. - In his desk. - Liar. I'm telling you, I'm telling you. - She took it. - No, no, no, there, the drawer. If you're right, it's your hard luck. Scratch one hoodlum, where in the desk? There, bottom drawer. - Unlock it. - It's unlocked, button. - Where? - There, under there. Beat it, we're going to headquarters. Move over baby. Why you shoot him Mike? In cold blood like that? I, I thought they'd killed you. That was decent of you but we'll pass that for the minute. I don't think the cops will squawk about Martinelli... not when we prove he knock off Johnny. What do you mean? Oh, we got to be all square with John Law Mike. We're going down to headquarters and lay it on the line, the whole story. We're going to headquarters? You tried to kill me just now. You expected me to be the first one out that room... you know that when I came out I know a lot more than when I went in. You know, you're right about that, you're going to fry, Dusty. Rip, can't we put this behind us? Can't you forget? The trouble is I can't forget that I might die tomorrow. Suppose you got sore at me some morning for leaving the tap off the toothpaste tube? Then there's Johnny. When a guy's pal is killed, he ought to do something about it. Don't you love me? That's the tough part of it. But it'll pass, those things do, in time. And then there's one other thing, I loved him more. - What you do with the gun? - Right here in my pocket. Give it to me. Is it a blue, sick world for you, isn't it? Yes, is like I said, somebody always pushes me, give me the gun. If you shoot baby, you'll smear us all over the highway. Rip, Rip, where is Rip? He's coming, he'll be right here. Never mind how you spelled, I'll get it from Krause himself when he comes to. - She wants you. - Any hope? She's lucky. Who? Captain? - Murdock, you got a call in from Washington. - Yeah. Since when was you a captain? No, you don't have to salute lieutenant, I'm out of uniform. Hello? General Steele? Yes sir. Mission all cleaned up sir. Well, as soon as I can get a plane. Oh, there's one thing general. The ceremony will have to be changed some. Sergeant Drake's Medal of Honor will have to be awarded posthumously. Yes sir. So am I sir. Goodbye sir. Hello kid. This is it for me Rip, isn't it? I wouldn't kid you Mike. Let me hang on to you. Your hand. I'm so scared. I wish you could put me in your pocket now. Everything slipping. Inside I'm falling. Like going out the jump door. Hold your breath and just let go Mike, don't fight it. Remember all the guys who've done it before you. You'll have plenty of company Mike. High class company. Geronimo Mike.
