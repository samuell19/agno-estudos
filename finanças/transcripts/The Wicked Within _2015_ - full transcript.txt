Stab wound to the chest, heavy blood loss, blood pressure dropping. Make sure we have uncrossed matched blood waiting. Five milligrams of morphine, IV. Is surgery prepping? This is simple, Maggie. All you have to do is tell the truth. It's the easiest thing to remember. Breathe. Try again. Slower. I was just leaving when she was dropping... She was... I'm sorry. Um, I was just dropping something off at her house. Who was at the house when you first got there? Hannah. It's in the kitchen next... on the counter. It's on the counter next to the stove. Excuse me. You're not gonna stop and say hello? I know you have family over, so I was just... you know. So... So you just... baked a beautiful cake... and were just gonna drop it off with some flowers and leave? I just... I want to let... I don't know. Pfft! I just want to let you know I was thinking of you, that's all. I... I really don't want to intrude. Are you kidding me? We have tons of food. You must join us. Are you sure? Yes. Thanks. Besides, I need your help. My mother is here. What time did you finish your work last night? 6:30. How do you know her? We worked at Pretty Pennies online store. She kind of took me under her wing. She's like that. Hey, everyone, look what I found in the yard. And there's her husband, of course, Michael. I hope you didn't let her in. Uh, I can always take my cake back... and eat it without you guys. Oh, no. If you brought us gifts, that's different. Come here. Oh, okay. Anyone else at that time? Luke. - Hey, baby, how's it going? - Good. - Long time. - I know. Long time no see. How are you? I'm great. Let me get these. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. - If it helps, just yell. - Okay. While you're at it, maybe get Hannah up dancing or something, because her ass is just too fine to be sitting on a chair all day. Bethany, I am going to slap your husband for being inappropriate. Ladies, ladies, I bear gifts. Where did you get those? They're beautiful. Is this a cake? Yes. Maggie's here, and she's joining us for dinner. Good. Jean, where do they keep their vases in here? I don't know. I can't find anything. So in your search, if you find a colander, give me a call. You know, in fact, you should give me a call... to let me know why my daughter doesn't call, because... This has nothing to do with him. Wait, whoa, whoa. What has nothing to do with me? What has nothing to do with me? You don't communicate, that's what the problem is. Mom, would you cook? Does this look like it's a problem? I don't see any grand babies, so obviously there's some problem with intercourse somewhere. We just got married. Stop it. Just stop. Don't. And I'm not talking about sex with my mother-in-law again. Oh. Well, you may not want to talk about it, but let me tell you, what were you doing during that six-year engagement? I am not talking sex with my mother-in-law. Get out. Out! Get out! Get me a glass of wine. Mom, seriously. You've had too many. No? Okay. Hannah, the house looks wonderful. You should banish me more often. That's funny, Jean. I was thinking the exact same thing. We didn't banish anyone. We just didn't want... you around. Well, if you wanted to be alone, you should have gone on a vacation... to a beach, with rum drinks and little umbrellas. Jean, have a glass of wine. I think you'll find that's called a "stay cation." - It's environmentally friendly. - It's basically a vacation but at home. Hmm? For a whole year? It wasn't a year, Mom. It felt like a year. And besides, a "stay cation"? I don't know. Sounds like something poor people do. Mom! Jean, that's awful. You're an awful snob. You are! I know that you're not poor, although... I don't exactly know how you make money with an online clothing store, because people can just order things, and they can wear them out... to, you know, a rave or whatever, and then... Don't laugh at me. And then they can just send it back and expect a full refund. That is something that you would do, Mom. Sorry. Hang on a minute, Jean. Are you telling me you go to raves? - Because, I have to say... - Frequently. Killer moves. Very, very sexy. Shut up. Yeah. No, most people are cool, you know. Sometimes we do get stuff back that smells kind of like fish food. But we have a special file for those guys, don't we? Yes, we do. "Fish food files." Very clever. Was that a compliment? Mm-hmm. You should just stop while you're ahead. I think it was. This looks delicious. Let's start. Thank you to the chef. Cheers. Cheers. Seriously, that's great. No, no. No, thank you. Ever since he found out Cabernet has calories, he's scared of it. - No. - I'm terrified. Hannah, sweetie, that's your third glass. I know that, Mom. My husband's an accountant. Bad girl. Yes, I'm just saying that you have to be careful about mixing alcohol and your meds. But it makes your teeth so pretty and pink. I'm fine, Mom. - No, you're not. - Mom! Why don't you pass Maggie the sauce? No one gives a shit about the sauce. You are an Olympic deflector. Why are we not really talking here? Hmm? Honesty is healthy. You guys are so desperate to be cheerful, and... we're acting like nothing happened. This is what happens when families are apart too long. Jean, you know, I think the important thing right now... is that we are all here. Only because we were allowed to be here. Yeah, and it means a lot that you came. I think that Emma would have really liked it. Yeah, it feels good to be together again, as a family. Yes, it does. Michael and Hannah, I love you both so much, and I just... I think that... the best thing we have to offer to the world is your combined gene pool. And I think the family should expand, and I want some grand babies to squeeze. If you don't need a therapist, why do you need those? Therapy is doing nothing but making me more depressed, Mom. Then change therapists. You think that you can just come in here... and start telling me what to do? I... Do you know what it's like to lose a child, Dr. Woods? No. Oh. It's like she's not where she's supposed to be. She's not in my arms. And I know she's gone, but that doesn't stop me from looking for her. So, they had Bethany come back and bought this feng shui CD. And it sounded so bad. It sounded like Japanese porn music. So I played it the next time we've done it. - TMI for a mother-in-law. - Sorry. Weird! I keep thinking she's still up in her room and we're gonna wake her up. - Beth. - I'm so sorry. It's okay. No. We're fine. Really. We're just glad you're here. Maggie, can you hurry up with that sugar rush... before my husband bores us to death with one of his speeches? Yeah, well, it looks terrific. Let's cut it. - One second, Jean. Um... - Oop, too late. Thank you for the introduction, sweetheart. Um, we just wanted to say... it's been a difficult year, but, um, in honor of her birthday... - To Emma. - To Emma. - To Emma. - To Emma. - To Emma. - To Emma. Now let's have some cake. Whoa. How did she do that? That is so weird. The knife just moved by itself. Whoa! That was weird. No, you're being silly. You just bumped the table. - What's in this coffee? - Here, you do it. Okay, as I remember, big pieces for the boys, yes? Excuse me. Beth? Honey... Now... Why don't you tell me... how the others died. Oh, my God. Jesus! Shit! You scared me. What is wrong with you? You look terrible. - Are you pregnant? - No. Can we just not have this conversation? What are you waiting for? Mom, now... It's just not fair to Hannah, you know? What's not fair to Hannah? I should have come before. But you couldn't. Well, no, I didn't... Tea? I didn't want to come here and make you feel bad, you know... I got a little overemotional... I've been such a mess that it doesn't even matter. Okay? Wait, wa... Wait. I'm sorry. You didn't invite me to come... to be with you, and yet you asked her? Is that right? And did you come? No. I bet you didn't even get an e-mail saying that she was too busy. Totally understandable. Mom, I invited Bethany to come... because she doesn't judge me... and Luke because he makes Michael laugh. But you didn't come, because of your precious emotions. You have always been a narcissist. Mom, that's not... Mm, mm, mm. She's right. No, she's not. I'm sorry. It gave me a chance, um... or just gave me a reason... not to clear out her room. I thought maybe you'd want to say good-bye. I'd like that. I know. I do it every day. Okay. Hannah. So is Beth okay? She'll be fine, hon. She's always had a flair for the dramatic. She just needs a minute. Cocktails, anyone? Mm-hmm. You know, I think I'll make some tea. Would anyone else like some tea? Uh, no, thanks, Mom. Hannah, should I go check on Bethany? She's fine. I... Well, I imagine being the world's first human magnet... would mess with your head a little. I'm sorry. Did that not just freak everyone the fuck out? There has to be a logical explanation to that. Well, the lodestone is indigenous to this area. You take, um, the ocean being nearby, full moon in the springtime, and it probably caused some kind of freak electromagnetic reaction. Really? And I just saw an Asian leprechaun... with an Afro... run by the front door. You've got too much time on your... Shh! What... - Did you guys just hear that? - What? - Did you hear something? - I didn't hear anything. - I thought I heard a screaming. - I'm gonna go check on Bethany. I'll be back in a minute. You didn't hear that? No, I didn't. You didn't just hear that? No. I'm sure it was Jean. Beth? Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. Are you sure? Yeah. I think I might have just passed out. Do you want me to call you a doctor? No. No, I... I'm just exhausted. I don't want to cause anymore fuss. Okay? Am I interrupting anything? Hey. No, not at all. Maybe you can come out here and talk some sense into your sister. I think she might need a little doctor. I don't need to see a doctor. I'll leave you guys alone. I'll see you in a bit. Okay. Hey, honey. Hey. Hey. You feeling okay? I feel horrible. Aw. What's the matter? Bethany, what are you doing? Ow! Cast me out... into the ungodly and turn me over into to the hands of the wicked. What are you saying? You're among the wicked, Hannah. Bethany, are you okay? You're among the wicked. Bethany, stop that. Ow! You're scaring me. Stop! I know your secret. Give me... Hey! I know your secret. - I know your secret! - Stop it, Bethany! This isn't fucking funny anymore. Let go of me! Stop it! Geez. Why glimpse through an abomination to the Lord? It says here your sister... was in a recovery center in 1996... for... exhaustion. Hmm. Interesting euphemism. What was she in recovery for? Uh... She was in rehab for, like, a week. But it was because she was having panic attacks. Mm-hmm. I guess she thought that pot smoking might help with that. These panic attacks, were they the result of her drug use, or was the psychosis a, um, preexisting condition? No, no, she... I mean-I mean, she wasn't a drug addict, and she wasn't mentally ill. She was just ranting like she was batshit crazy. Sweetheart, please. You know how she is. Don't let her rattle your cage so much. Yeah. - My family drives me nuts. - I know. Everybody's does, right? Yeah. Mmm. - Is that Bethany? - Hannah, wait, wait, wait. Was that Bethany? Beth! Beth! What the hell is going on? Sweetheart! Beth? Oh, my God. Honey! Do you have anything to calm her down? Hannah, go get the pills now. What pills? What? Please! We don't know what she's already taken. Okay, okay, okay. She could have been high already. Bethany? Oh! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! - Okay, let me in. - Bethany, breathe, honey. Shh! You got it? Slow down! I got her. Okay, okay. Let's drink this. Come on. Just breathe. Shh! Okay, just one breathe. Easy, easy, easy. Shh, shh, shh. Swallow it. Swallow it. Swallow... What? Is it supposed to work that fast? I don't think so. Luke! You still with us? Have you seen this? Oh, my God. Okay. Let's try this again, shall we? Did you write the message, Luke? If you think I'd write some fucked up message to my in-laws... about their dead daughter, then maybe you're the one who needs their head checked. Sweetheart... garbage disposals don't just turn themselves on. I'm not crazy, Michael. I tried to turn it off. I did. It wouldn't turn off. Guys... Do you think this could be Emma? Like Emma's spirit, maybe? No, no, no. Her ghost, maybe. - Please, let's not go there. - Her ghost? Why wouldn't she have just gone straight to heaven? I mean, Emma was only three years old, for Christ's sake. I know someone that can help us. I can get her to come over. Is she a doctor? She's someone that can tell us if it's really Emma or not. Worst-case scenario, we rule out any other sort of possibilities. So, you mean she's a psychic? The last thing we need is... some woo-woo, carny weirdo that... What kind of person comes to strangers' houses in the middle of the night? Hmm? Michael? Jean... If she's here, I want to know. Bethany wrote it. Bethany wrote it, Jean? Really? How? And how did she do that? If my wife is crazy, I wanna know. Hey, I wanna go to bed. Keep an eye on her tonight. Get her a doctor first thing in the morning. But right now she should rest. I feel terrible. Maggie. Call your friend. Do you think your wife was possessed? No. I don't know. I don't know anything. I don't even know how we ended up with a psychic. Samara, come in. Can I take your jacket or... your hat? Do you mind if we skip the pleasantries and I just take a look around? Yeah, do you mind if I come with? Yeah, I do, actually. Emma's room is upstairs to the left. Yeah, it is. That wasn't a question. Where are the others? In the dining room. Keep them there. Subtle. Hmm. Ow! Ow. All right, I get it. Well, congratulations. There is definitely a presence here. It's a pretty strong one. How old was Emma when she died? She was, um... Almost four. And how long have you been in this house? Shouldn't you know all this already? Almost five years. How did she die? She... It was an accident at home. I found her. Okay. I'm gonna need some candles. White ones preferably. I'm going to try to make contact... with this entity. Okay, so before we begin, I must warn you that this is serious shit. This is not a game. And if anybody needs to go to the bathroom, I suggest that you do so now, because people have been known to piss their pants. I'll be right back. That... That was Emma's. Please concentrate. Focus. I call upon the guiding spirits... to cloak each and every soul in this room tonight... in your glowing white light. I'd also like to invite the four archangels to be the gatekeepers. Michael to be the protector, Uriel to guard the circle, Gabriel to be the communicator and Raphael to be the healer. I ask that the masters keep this room bathed in white light, and may we always be acting for the highest good. Thank you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Abracadabra. Maggie, could you please change seats with Luke? - Any reason? - You're pretty. Oh. We're here tonight to try to make contact with Emma Anderson, the young girl who died in this house. Emma. Are you here with us? Emma, would you like to speak to us? Emma, is that you? I'm here. Are you the young girl Emma that died in this house? No, I'm not dead. Oh, my God. Where are you, Emma? Aunt Bethany's house. - How did you get in Bethany's house? - Mommy. Mommy took you to Bethany's house? What does she mean by Bethany's house? Are you mad at Mommy, Emma? - Mommy hurt... - Okay, this is bullshit! - Sit back down. - I'm done with this, okay? Enough! - Hannah, please. - Are you kidding me? Is it because Mommy didn't come with you? Are you just gonna just sit here and listen to this woman? Because Mommy couldn't come to where you are? It hurts. Oh. Did it hurt you when you died, Emma? Get this woman out of my house right now! Oh, I'll get the lights. Once invited into play, darkness does not go away. - Oh, my God. - Oh, there's no God here, lover. Not that that would bother you, Hannah. How one lives with herself, I'd really like to know. Please, who are you? "Please." I like that. What do you want with Beth? Oh, nothing that 53 men haven't done before you, Luke. Bethany is me. I am Bethany. We're the best of friends. - You stay away from my wife. - Or what? Exactly, you spineless worm. Besides... We like it here. I am home. Beth! Beth? Beth? So, what happened after the table shook... and Samara teleported... from one side of the room to the other? Dr. Woods... Don't you think our minds sometimes block things out for a reason? That's okay. You have to talk to me, Michael. You're gonna have to tell me things. I've been doing this for, oh, damn near 22 years. It's an unfair advantage. Most killers don't have that much experience. You got it? She's looking better. You okay, princess? Michael. Michael. Oh, Michael. Michael, come close. Oh, Michael. Mmm. You made me so wet. Oh, my God. I want you so much. Beth? Touch me. Mmm. Michael, I want you so much. Bethany. Come on, Michael. No secrets anymore. We both know you still think about me. - She doesn't know what she's saying. - She does. Ask Michael. Tell me she's wrong, Michael. Is she wrong, Michael? Come on, Michael. No secrets anymore. We both know you still think about sleeping with me. Tell me she's wrong. Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! No, no, no! - Stop it! Ow! - - Sorry, sorry. Fuck, just stop. Bastard! Oh, Hannah, you know you married a whore. And by the way, the sluttier you act, the more pathetic you look and the more you disgust him. Just stop it now, okay? Stop it, Bethany. Stop it! Hey, Hannah, I love you. - There's only you. - Liar! He's always wanted me more. How could you? Don't think she doesn't lie to you too, Michael. Tell him your secret, Hannah. What? Emma didn't just fall down the stairs all on her own, did she now? Hannah. Hannah? I'm asking you. What did you do to Emma? Hannah's favorite thing about working from the home... is the fact that she didn't have to drive. She could drink as much as she wanted. Hannah didn't find Emma at the bottom of the stairs. No. She put her there. You lie! Shut up... A toddler in one arm, a drink in the other. She lost her step. She dropped her child, but not the drink. No. She didn't spill a drop. Oh, God, no! - How do you know this? - Who are you? I'm Belial, Lord of the Flies. I can see into your soul, and you're the man who left his child in the care of a drunk. You condemned your child. She just carried out the sentence. I want my lawyer. Luke, you have two choices. You can stay and we can talk a little longer, or you can go wait in the cell for a few hours, and then we can talk a little longer. What do you want to know? You don't think your wife's condition... was a convenient distraction for what was really going on? I know my wife. She wasn't there. And I know if I called the police or a doctor, they would have pumped her full of lithium... and locked her in a padded cell with that thing inside her. Please come in. Father Patrick. We spoke earlier on the phone. Thanks for coming. So where's your wife now? She's... She's upstairs. Thanks. So come in. Have you called a psychiatrist? We thought about it. Father, are you able to perform exorcisms? Exorcisms went out in about the 1600s. No matter what you've seen in the movies, they are pretty much extinct. And psychology's taken over now, and mental illness is usually... account for most cases of peculiar activity. We stopped witch hunts too. What about miracles? Does the church have a scientific explanation for that? Miracles are real. I'm freezing. Luke? Luke? Who are you? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're mine. So you say this entity, or demon, if that's what it is, speaks to you? He said he was the light bringer, also known as morning star. He also said he was king of the flies, whatever that means. Well, Lucifer is a more common name for "light bringer," which translates into "morning star." Belial is the Lord of the Flies. I mean, all these are references to the devil. I mean, it being the devil itself, however, stretches the outer reaches of... likelihood and even possibility. Look, Father, my wife is in the other room... with something pretty unfriendly inside her. So I'm about ready to try anything you've got. All right. So what do you think may have attracted the devil to your wife? He means, "Is she a bad person?" - She's as good as gold. - If that's the case, it is possible that she was the victim of a poor environment. M-Morally speaking. My daughter was raised in a wonderful environment. And morally speaking, what you're doing is actually fanning the flames of superstition. What, are you recruiting by fear these days? Bethany doesn't need a priest. She doesn't need a psychic. She needs medical help. It is the middle of the night. I'm going home. But I will be back in the morning... with a professional in tow. Jean... Mom, I'll walk you out. Jean, thank you. The devil, my ass. I will be back tomorrow. So... you hold the fort, hmm? Okay. I'm sorry. Are you ready, Father? Okay. Beth! Bethany! Bethany! I guess this is how Christine felt when you left her on the side of the road. What? You didn't know her name? They're filthy liars, Father, but not me. No! No! Get off! You know, Father, if you wanna be screwed with, you should make a little effort, you know, maybe curl up that pretty hair of yours or something. Should keep her tied down, somewhere we can see her preferably. Come on. Normally no, but... Under these circumstances... I think it's best we wait before we attempt anything else. Dark powers are strongest in the late hours. Why don't you stay over, Father? We'd all feel safer with you around. Uh, no. I must go and pray and seek guidance from the church... if... I mean, how best to fight this. Please try and keep Bethany as comfortable as possible. Stay together. You're stronger that way. And I'll see you in the morning, Maggie. Beth. Luke, come here. Come here. Beth? Please, come here. Beth. Yes. Yes. What are you doing? I don't know. I thought I saw Bethany. Bethany's tied up downstairs in the living room. No. Yeah, she is. Are you okay? Yeah. So what was your wife's relationship with Michael? I understand they used to date? I think you're swimming up the wrong stream there, Dr. Woods. And what stream would that be, Luke? The one that says my wife's a whore. - Oh, I didn't say that. - We're done here. Okay, let's back it up. What was the reason... that you were spying on him in his room? I wasn't spying on him. I thought I saw her go up the stairs. So you were jealous. No. Yes. Look, I was downstairs. I went to the bathroom. I could have sworn I saw her go up the stairs. Okay. It's good to see you, Father. The, um... The bishop has given me permission to, uh... to monitor the situation in a more official capacity. Where is everybody? Inside. Come in. So, Father, what now? Well, for the church to allow me to perform an exorcism, I need to show a case of possession. What are we looking for? Uh... Several things. I mean, the church's list is rather lengthy... for this sort of approval. I mean, to begin with, speaking in a foreign tongue. What did she say? It's Latin, right? Are you kidding? Bethany don't speak Latin. It appears she does now. Yeah, you've proved your point, spirit. Yes. Let's do this. Your brother died poorly, Father. You were in attendance at his hour of death. I was. How did you know that? I know these things. Get used to it. Do you remember what he whispered to you? I do. The Catholics still believe suicide... to be an unforgivable sin. Yes. So, tell me, Father, why, when he asked you with his dying breath... if he would go to hell, did you tell him yes? No, I am bound by the truth. - And Jesus said that suicide... - You're nothing like him. Jesus was a carpenter. He was. Yeah, and you just nailed and screwed a lot, eh, Padre? The Lord will protect me and the others... and the girl that you've so wrongfully entered. Discard the girl's essence, hide behind insanity where they'll never find it. You've no control here. Oh, really? Father, do something! Help, help, help! Untie her! Please help. Please help. Shh, shh. It's okay. Bethany. Shh, shh. It's okay. You die, Father. Is it gonna stop that? It seems to be gathering strength. It's trying to create fear. Fear is our worst enemy. And then we must pray and wait for this demon to show its hand. An even better reason for us to take our time. Can't you just please do something? We can't take this anymore. Look, how will we know what it wants? Maybe... Maybe it's a test, like Job or something. Job? What the hell is Job? Satan challenged God by saying that Job only praised him... because of all the gifts that God has given him. So God told Satan... that he could test Job's faith in any way he wished, provided he didn't kill him. So the devil responds by, um, taking away Job's family, destroying his crops, slaying his cattle, turning his friends against him. But instead of turning away from the Lord, as the devil hoped, he asked for forgiveness of his sins. He not only prayed for his own sins... but for the sins of his sons, never once doubting his faith... and thus proving the devil wrong. Can God give permission to the devil to annihilate someone's life? That's fucked up. Yeah, this place has got some seriously bad energy. But something told me I should come back. Plus, I missed you guys. Hannah. Oh, I see you brought in the God squad. Greetings, Padre. Um, it's Father Patrick. Samara. The psychic. Uh, yes. - Interesting. - Thank you. I would have chosen "mysterious" and "beautiful," but "interesting's" good. So, how's our little demon doing today? Ha-ha. My puppet on a string. Are you flirting with me? Those voices you hear, your so-called guardian angels, do you know them very well? You can't tell the difference between them... and me. Why don't you go back to sticking your fingers down your throat? You can't save her and she's not worth dying for. Yeah, well, I'll be the judge of that. Because you can't be everywhere all at once, my sassy little spirit. And right now, may I remind you, you are cowering behind a lady, dude. Suck my dick, fatty. Whip it out, bitch. Sit on my lap. It's a waste of time. We should all be preparing. And then I'll show you. Mommy, I'm scared. I don't wanna be alone. Help me. Please. Come with me, Mommy. I'm too scared to be by myself. Hannah. Hannah. We all need to be here together... if we're to save your sister's soul. I just want her to forgive me. We must all ask for forgiveness. Each of us. Priests included. You also have a husband... who needs your love and prayers. Will that be enough? Don't underestimate yourself, Hannah. More candles, um, some matches... and most likely more duct tape. Well, I can get candles and matches. The duct tape is down in the basement. Where in the basement? I'll get it. Uh, it's on the shelves. There's a whole bunch of it. You shouldn't go alone. I should probably accompany you. Oh, that's sweet, Father. But I'm a big girl. I think I can manage. After you're done here, can you go check on her? Seriously, don't! What the hell is the matter with you? I almost had a freakin' heart attack. - You scared the shit out of me! - Is everything okay? Luke just scared the shit out of me. Are we gonna stand here all night or are we actually gonna do this? We're ready, as soon as Samara gets back with the duct tape... That's outside. Come on. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Come on. Let's get back. It's a party. How'd you like my little human piñata? Why did you do that to her? No, no, Maggie! No! "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." What do you want from us? Get away from her! Oh, my God, I don't wanna die. You're not gonna die. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Dumb bitch, she's my whore. "I exorcise thee and all unclean spirits..." in the name of God the Father Almighty, and in the name of Jesus Christ, his son, our Lord and judge, and in the power of the Holy Spirit, that thou depart from this creature of God, Bethany, that it may be made the temple of the living God, through the same Christ our Lord, "who shall come to judge the living and the dead and the world of fire." May God rise up and dissipate his enemies. May God rise up and dissipate his enemies. May God rise up and dissipate his enemies. May God rise up and dissipate his enemies. The power of Christ compels you! The power of Christ compels you! The power of Christ compels you! How about "let the power of Christ compelling"... comes after my head spins around and I masturbate with a crucifix? Now I've weakened you, demon, I can tell. I weakened you more, Father. Ah! Oh, God, no! No! What's the matter? Little naked man on a stick too hot for you? I'm sorry. Bethany, I'm so sorry. If you would only come out to stop this, I promise I will never lie to you again. Never lie? Well, I'll do a deal with you, Luke. Please tell Bethany. Tell her about Christine. Tell her about your little accident. I'll let her go. Don't listen, Luke. It's just trying to exhaust you. Shut up, choir boy! It won't let her go, no matter what you say. - Father! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Tell her the truth, Luke. I'll let her go. Come on, come on. And why is that interesting, demon? Because it'll condemn his spirit to hell. What'll it be, cowboy? Come on, come on, come on, come on. Tell Bethany. I'll let her go. Okay. Okay. I'll tell her. I'll tell her. What... Luke? Beth. Baby, please. Sweetheart. Why am I here? Baby. Wh... Wait. Tell me what? Tell me what? Sweetheart, you know how... Well, do you remember one night last year... I got home so late? Yeah. And I told you I hit something on the road? Yeah. Um, you-you hit a deer. Y... You hit a deer. Yeah? What did you do? Uh... Oh, baby. Baby, I-I-I-I gave up drinking, remember? And the reason why is because that night, I-I was drunk, and it was raining so, so heavily. Baby... I didn't hurt a deer. What did you do? What did you do? What did you do? What did you do? I can't do this. Please, God. Fail, loser. Boring. Luke didn't hit a deer. Luke hit a woman with his car. He was too much of a coward to help her... because her jaw was three feet from her face. No. Coward. Luke. Is it true? It was, uh... I don't... It's not the way... It was an accident. I didn't fucking mean it. I didn't fucking mean it! I didn't fucking mean it! Hannah, take Luke upstairs. I'll make a deal with you, Maggie. Tell us what you want, hmm? Ah. I'll let her go. Shut the fuck up. I bargain with no demon. I've done nothing wrong. You can't have him. He's not gonna leave God for you. I know what makes you tick. Ticktock. Ticktock. Maggie wants the padre's cock. Shut up! I'll kill you! Oh, my God. Just make sure she doesn't escape. I'm so sorry, Father. I was never going to do anything, I swear. Sometimes... God and the devil, they... they test our strength. And they come in many forms. I don't wanna be tested. I... I just want you. Please, please, leave this. Leave with me. They don't care. They don't deserve to be saved. Can't you see that? No. Jesus died for the forgiveness of sins. I can't turn my back on them. My faith won't allow it. God, what am I... Fuck! What am I saying? I can't believe I wanna abandon my friends. No, no. Maggie, Maggie, you've done nothing wrong. I am so afraid. Please help me. Please. I'm so sorry. I can't. I can't. I can't give in to temptation. I refuse to let the devil win. Father! Father! Help! Please, somebody help! Someone help me! Padre! Come on. Father. Father? He's dead, he's dead. He's dead! He's dead. God love him. He's dead. Really? He rejected you, Maggie. You should be thanking me. Good. You're all here. I like it when I can see the death in your faces. I'm calling the police now. With what? Two yogurt cups and a piece of string? It's not working. Why isn't it working? None of your phones work, you stupid bitch. Who are you gonna call, your mom? She won't answer. What do you want? I just wanna play. If you wanna kill us, please, just kill us now. That's no fun. I am done playing. Watch this. Oh, my God. Oh, God! Oh, God! Somebody help me! Oh, help me! - What do you think of that, Michael? - She deserves it. Just fucking stop. Stop! You're killing her! Michael, for God's sake! I know what you want. I'll do it. I'll give you my faith. Oh, Michael! I'll even kill her myself, if you want me to. Do it for me, Daddy. - Michael! Michael! - Michael, you don't want this! Yes, I do. Michael. Michael. - Move. - Please! Michael, please stop! Move. Move. Move. What's wrong with you? You got a kitten in your purse? Drop these losers! Michael, no! No. No! Bethany, listen to me. I know you can hear me. You have to save us. Bethany! Feels good. I hadn't stretched in a while. Hit me. I do so beg of you. Boo! Bethany, I need you. Stop it! Help me. Help me. Please. You can help me. Please, please. Shut up, bitch! Come back where you belong. I grew up with sinners. And not one of you would turn to God for help. Not one of you had faith. So here's your choice. Kill yourself... and save your sister. Sacrifice yourself for her, or she dies and you live. You lie. You lie! Oh, ye of little faith. How I adore thee. Please. Please. Please, God! Please! God? There's no God here. Now, what's your choice? Go on. Do the right thing. Do it. Do it, Hannah. Oh, please, God, I'm sorry. Please forgive me for what I've done. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come... You're wasting your time! Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us. Satan, I forgive you. Hannah. Hannah, I love you. Lead us not into temptation... but deliver us from evil. I was never here to take your soul. I was here to save it. Amen. Do you really think Bethany would have stabbed herself in the chest? Or do you think it's more likely Hannah would stab her sister... because she suspected her of sleeping with her husband? What do you think? Hannah came totally unhinged over Emma's death... and felt threatened. Once her family knew her secret, she would always be the woman whose neglect caused the death of her baby. Where was Hannah when her mother died? What? What are you talking about? Jean left. Didn't she? She couldn't let her mother leave the house. Jean knew her secret, and Hannah knew she'd never keep it to herself. Who made the drinks that night? She could have given Bethany any number of drugs. Drugs that made her as delusional... as Hannah needed her to be. Where was Hannah when Samara was killed? In Emma's room. Did you see her there? No. Then how do you know? I saw. I-I was there. I saw Bethany throw people across the room. And she knew things that no one could have told her. So what makes more sense? A hallucination... or the devil in the living room. Okay. This allows me to transcribe what we've talked about. Thank you for being so cooperative. After you sign that, you're free to go. Where are the others? Well, they're next door. I'm not finished with them. You're wrong about tonight, Doctor. The devil was there. You'll see. I can't wait to see the look on your face when you do. Go get some rest. Hey, did you get everything you needed from her? Oh, yeah. I didn't need her. She's been released. Listen. I think you need to talk to Luke one more time. He just mentioned something in the interrogation room about a hit-and-run last September. I don't know. I could barely understand him. I think we need you. Just clean up with a few more questions, and don't let them go until I tell you, okay? All right, no problem. Come get me if they give you a hard time. Oh. I'll take care of Hannah. All right? Yep. Oh, Neil, the look on your face. You think you've figured it out, don't you? If anyone can do it, I can. They'd call it a miracle. People don't question what Jesus did. Even if you can't understand, it doesn't mean it didn't happen. Close your mouth, Neil. It's not flattering. Much better. Come on. It's so easy. Think. Do I have to spell it out for you? It's a test, Neil. Like Job. Remember? The priest was a surprise. I didn't expect him to fall for man's oldest desire. But I was wrong. The psychic was a false prophet. She was always destined to be with me. The real game was the test for the others. Michael... a loving husband, but a better adulterer... his immorality led to his own self-destruction. Luke the murderer. Yes, he did confess in the end, but just not to God. Hannah I cannot take. She was the only one to turn to him, and one day her soul will be reunited with that of her daughter. God can have them both... Bethany too. But as for her unborn child, well, I can't tell you everything. I chose this family after watching them for a while. I mean, between murderers and adulterers, my odds were pretty high. It's more about watching people fail than just taking their souls. And you, Neil, pretending to be the protector of truth, but you forget only God can judge. You had all the evidence in front of you, and yet you've just condemned an innocent woman. Don't you see? You betrayed God. It's time to go, Neil. Your soul's mine. All of you meet me at least once. I take many forms. You can call me temptation, but I am Lucifer, the light bringer. I am Belial. I am the morning star. Closed-Captioned by Captions, Inc., Burbank, CA
