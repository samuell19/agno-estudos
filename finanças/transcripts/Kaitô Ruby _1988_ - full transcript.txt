Toru, get up! You're gonna be late again! You okay? Thanks! That goes over there! Hayashi, comin' in late again like you own the place? Can you check mine, too? I ordered something, so I was wondering if it arrived already. Rumi Kato, is it? Yup! C'mon in! I've been cleaning all day, y'know! - Um… Do you need some help? - That'd be great! - So you live on the second floor? - Yeah. - What's your name? - Hayashi. I've got a business card. - Toru Hayashi? - Yeah. What kinda company is "Aiwa Mail System"? - Uhh, that's… - You can keep that photo. Ah… Right. How should I put it? Well, our company takes care of addressing for ad agencies and such. - Oh I see. - Um… Is it fine here? Yeah. What do you do for a living, Miss Rumi? My friends call me Ruby, by the way. - Ah, that's cool. - I guess. I guess you could call what I do a stylist. But I also write copy for ads. Huh? You work alone, then? I used to work at an ad agency, actually. But I got into a fight with the boss so I quit. - I'm freelancing now. - I see… I needed a change of pace, so I moved. Hey, this goes over there. Kinda heavy, huh? Hayashi. What are you doing? Aw, thanks! You're so thoughtful. See you. Can't you come in for a sec? - Ah, well, my mom is… - Oh, she won't mind waiting a little. Actually she's waiting for me to start dinner… So then your mom never got remarried and ended up raising you on her own? It was a good thing she already had her license as a beautician. - Is she still doing that? - Yeah. She helps at a friend's salon whenever they're short on staff. We wouldn't be able to make rent on my income alone. Ah, what about your parents, Rumi? It's fine if you call me Ruby, y'know. Lotsa stars out tonight! You into constellations? I'm a Sagittarius, you? Ah, Pisces, but… That's not… - What about your bloodtype? - O… I'm B. They say B and O-types get along well. Right. Do you know what I am? - Sagittarius? - I mean my what I do for a living. Stylist, right? That's just what I want people to think. Huh? This is between you and me, okay? Okay… I'm a criminal. - A criminal? - Yeah. By criminal, do you mean… Like, someone who does bad things? You ever hear of a criminal who does good things? What kinda crime are we talking about… Murder? What do you take me for? Then what? Well, for the time being I'm a thief. A thief… Have you stolen anything yet? - Not yet. - Are you pulling my leg? Oh no joke! I fully intend to make it as a thief. But why? I wanna move to a better apartment. Visit other countries. - So, for money? - Yeah. But that's not all. I don't quite know what, but there's "something" out there. Will you help me? - Help you? - Team up with me. No way! I'm not capable of doing crimes! Oh, is that so? Yeah. So you've never stolen one of my things? - I'll give it back. - Nah, that's okay. I feel like you've got a talent. I've already got my eye on something, too. But before that I have to work something out. Like what? A plan. It's been on my mind ever since before I moved here. There's this little grocery shop. They deal in some good stuff there. The only employee there is the old guy who owns it. He doesn't employ anyone 'cause he's kind of a cheapskate. And cheapskates have this tendency to hoard cash, right? Their prices are pretty outrageous, so I expect he's saved up quite a bit. And that's our target. How? - That's what we gotta figure out. - What the… A good plan requires lots of preparation. That's where you come in. - Me? - Yup. You'll go to the shop, and observe the old man's behavior. Why? Because we need to plan this properly! No matter how small, we can't afford to miss a thing. Isn't it logical we investigate our target? When? Morning, noon, evening. We need data on all of these. I gotta go to work, though. The shop's close to where you work. You can go during lunch, or at the end of the day. - What will you do, Rumi? - I told you to call me Ruby. I will scout the surroundings. The surroundings? Boy, you are slow! "Is there a cop patrolling the area?" "Are there any crowded streets?" "Are there any dead ends?" There are a lot of things to take into account! Either way, observation is key. What are you spacing off for? What are you spacing off for? There's a pedestrian bridge here, and this place is one-way traffic. This is where the shop is, and over here is a police box. I'd like a floor plan of the shop, though. So get cracking! I don't know about this. - I'm scared. - What scared? You're just a customer coming in to browse, right? Is this that "something" you meant? Yeah! Don't you just love the sweet smell of crime? You're creeping me out! - It's not a dangerous job! - Even though… I just can't. Just… go! No way! Merci! Are you looking for something? Ah, no, I… Ah, there it is! This, please. That's 5300 Yen. (roughly USD 50) Five thou… He have a safe? Safe? What about a back entrance? Back entrance? What were you even doing in there? Hello, Aiwa Mail. Ah yes, just a second. Hayashi, it's for you. Hello? Come to my place when you're done. Big news. Huh? Yes. Okay. I will. I'll now report on my findings. The shop is out. The old man stores all of his money at the bank. And it's during that time we need to make our move. Here I have the same thing that he uses to transport his money to the bank. What do we do with it? Isn't it obvious? We swap it out! The old man goes to the bank every friday. He exits the store at 10AM, goes left on this street… makes a right turn at the place with the red bricks and arrives at this parking spot at 10:07AM. There's very few pedestrians here, so say you happen to pass by on your bike… crash into him, and here's the key part: Not too strong, but not too soft either. Just enough to send his bag flying. And then I just happen to pass by holding this bag swap it out with his, and we're in business! Got it? You got a bike? I'll lend you one. No problemo! Yes problemo! What? I… dunno how to ride a bike. - You'll learn! - I'll learn? I don't have the time! What about before work? No good. Too sleepy. We'll go to the park on Sunday! No good. It's embarrassing! Do it! No! What're you doing? I'm wearing it out. It has to look the part. Poor thing. - It's a bag. - No, I mean the geezer. He's so old. Did you not see his face? That's the face of a bad person. I'm sure he bullies people on the side. I wonder. Who knows, maybe he even cooks up weird drugs during the night? Tomorrow is the big day. I've got work! Just call in sick! I do feel kinda sick, yeah. When the job is done come to my place, okay? Yeah, if I don't end up in jail! Ouch! Look where you're going! A-are you okay? Don't you know how to ride a bike? I can't, actually. Then don't get on one! - Thank you. - Here… How'd we do? Look for yourself. 12,317 Yen. Got a lot on his savings account, though. No way to get it without him signing off on it, though. There's also a pension book, and some health insurance papers. Can you grab me that calculator? - Hey... - So, for the investigation… we bought 3540 yen worth of groceries. The bag was 9000 yen. Bike rental fees, 2000 yen. Ah, repair fees, too. About 1500 yen, I guess. Makes a total of… 16,040 yen. Those are our expenses. As for earnings… 12,317 yen. Which makes… - 3723 yen. - In the red. - Let's give it back. - Give it back? That's right, we're big time criminals. Chump change like this is below us! Gotta have some pride. Hey, the money for the caviar isn't in this. - Caviar? - 5300 yen. Anyway go and return the bag for now. Huh? I can't do that! Oh it's easy. Just say you mixed em up. No way! That won't work! Excuse me… This… When I crashed my bike I mistook it for my own. Thank you! Thank you! I was really worried there for a second! When I went to the bank the only thing in my bag were old magazines! Ah, thank you so much! You are an honest man! Me? I must repay you! Ah… That's okay. Please, you must accept. Would you like money? Goods? Ah, no, really it's okay. Actually, come to think of it… These are good! You want some? Nah, I bumpy food grosses me out. Yeah… Yes. Today's no good. Yeah, not really. That's what I said. Look, I just can't. I'll call you back, okay? Hey! I've done some reflecting. Our target can't be stuff like some cheapskate's bag. We have to aim for places that will definitely have a lot of money. What kinda place would that be? A bank, right? - A bank? - Yeah, we're gonna rob a bank. I've already got it planned. Already? Our target is the Hatazawa branch of the Central Bank. W… Wait just a second! That's "my" bank! What do you mean "my" bank? You own it? Well, no, but I have an account there. That's where my money is! - How much do you have? - Nothing worth talking about… That place isn't excessively large, which is ideal for my plan! But… But… Robbing a bank isn't easy, y'know! You see it in the movies a lot, those guys have guns… - and a getaway car… - Take it easy already! We aren't some gangster squad! It's really not that hard. Instead of a gun… you use this. "My partner is aiming a gun at you. Don't say a word and hand over the cash." "And don't try any funny stuff either if you value your life." How does this work? Just don't say a word and slide this over to them. Easy peasy! Most people value their life, so I don't expect any trouble. Remain quiet, get the money, leave without looking frantic. It's a cinch. - Who, me? - Yeah! This is a man's job, after all. But… It's my bank, so won't they recognize me? You go there often? Well, once a year. Who's gonna remember your face then? But if you're that worried you can wear a disguise. Disguise? What kind? I'll leave that up to you. Superman? I'll think of something. We also gotta investigate. - Again? - Yeah. Whether or not there's a cop, when they go on a smoke break, and so on. You know, if something's troubling you, you can talk to your mother. Whatever it is. Oh, I'm okay. Well I'm off. Have a good day! Did you bring the paper? Yeah, but… Can't we change the plan? Welcome! Number three looks like a pushover. Go for it! Just act cool. Cucumber style. - My heart can't handle this. - Don't worry. You're still young! Excuse me, sir. You dropped this. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ah… Um… Ah, yes? How can I help you? What's this? This is a joke, right? It's not! Sorry, but I don't have time for this. This… Please do as the paper says. Please don't waste my time, sir. You're really putting me on the spot here. I'm calling the guard, okay? - What went wrong? - I did exactly as you told me! Then why didn't it work?! I don't know! I handed over the paper like you said. But she just gave it right back to me. Lemme tell you, that lady was no pushover! W… What the hell? Read this! "Three bottles of milk One jar of yoghurt One pack of sour cream..." Ah, this is… Ah, I think this is… the note that my mother wrote for the milkman! I accidentally picked up the wrong one! - Haha, that's funny, hahaha… - I don't find this funny. I'm busy. We'll rent a car in Paris… and drive along the Riviera. What do you say? Or maybe if we drive to Italy via Switzerland? I'm thinking of using up all my vacation days. You're good whenever, right? Since you're working freelance. Don't just go deciding everything! I can take care of my own travel expenses! Just pay for your own airplane ticket and leave stuff like hotels and rental cars up to me. I'm need to arrange for those anyway. Welcome home. Oh my, are these for me? Something strange happened today. What? With the milkman. The milkman? Yeah, shortly after you left this morning I thought I heard him make a delivery. I figured it was him from the sound of the milk bottles. He walked up to the front door, and then I heard him scurry off like some kind of scared animal. So I go and look and he hadn't even left one bottle of milk! I don't know why, but for some reason he'd left money. - Money? - Yeah, 3300 yen. Hmm… Mom, you did leave a note for him, right? Don't I always? Aaah! What's wrong with you? Oh geez… Are you high? I'm fine, I'm fine. But I'm just gonna give this money back to the milkman. - Here you go. - Thanks. Here you go. Here you go. Hayashi, do you like movies? Yeah. I've got two discount tickets… You wanna go after work? What kinda movie? Does it matter? We can grab some dinner, too. Ah, that'd be nice. Well, later. Hello, Aiwa... Ah, yes. Yes. Um… T… Tonight? Tonight is a little… Ah, nothing in particular, but… Just now… Yes. Ah, no. Ah… Um… I'll be there… Have a good day. - I can't do tonight. - Huh? Why? I just remembered a prior engagement. Ah, I see. So you said you're coming afterwards, then? No mistakes this time. Don't you get it by now? I'm not cut out to be a criminal! Don't worry, this time'll be a breeze. Can't you just face reality and see I suck at this? Please just hear me out first, okay? It won't change a thing. It's a no from me. Weak! Yeah, fine, I'm weak. - So do it by yourself. - But I need a partner! This time more than ever! So then go find a partner who isn't weak! You already have one, don't you, Rumi? That guy's too serious. Hey, I'm serious, too! I get that. But I don't agree that a serious person can't be suited for crime. What matters is that you're serious "about" crime! So you're not going on a vacation? - I'm not. Why? - Oh, no reason… Does he know you're a criminal? I don't think so. I haven't mentioned it. You're the only one who I've told. Oh well, guess I'll ask him. - Ask what? - I thought you quit? Ah, well, I figured I'd at least ask… What's it matter if you're quitting? I was just curious about the job. Even though you didn't wanna hear me out earlier? I didn't say I wouldn't hear you out! Just that I wouldn't do the job, that's all. Same difference! - Is it? - It is. I'm calling him over, so go home. Wait! I… I wanna hear the plan first. Maybe I'll consider it if it's any good. You're talkin' mighty big for someone who's already screwed up an awful lot. Whatever happened before was outside of my control. I won't disappoint you this time. Oh? You won't disappoint me, you say? How much are these worth you think? Dunno? A lot? 2000 yen. Let's sell em for 500,000. How? A little game. All we gotta do is find a sucker. A sucker? When all's said and done the only shortcut to financial success is a good scam. No wasted efforts, no running around. - Now that's cool. - Cool? - Yeah! - So what do we do? I'll explain. Our sucker is a jeweller. Did you know there's a jeweller in Kamiizumi's first district? You'll go in there pretending to be the son of some wealthy big shot. A big shot? Why? It's the only way to get them to talk to you. Do I look like I could pass for a rich person? Not now you don't. You're gonna need some new clothes, and a business card. Oh, I already have a business card. Ah, did I not give you one? I mean a rich person's business card. One with a real swanky name on it. - Like? - Like for example… Mitsui or Koji something. Well, we'll decide on something later. Let's start with your entry. You're looking around for something expensive looking… then choose the right moment to grab one of the staff. It can't just be any old clerk. Gotta be someone important-looking. Then, you carefully take this out… And say: "This is a keepsake from my mother. I'd like to give it to my future wife, but…" That cheap thing? The price doesn't matter. It' a precious keepsake! To this rich guy it's invaluable. I see… So then you say: "I'm afraid that if I just carry this earring around… I might get careless and lose it somewhere." Then comes the most important part. You go: "If I managed to come across… a matching pair like it at your store… I'd give all the money in the world." No matter how much? Yeah, like 500 thousand, or even a million yen! You don't care, that's how rich you are. So then we wait a week. Then my part comes into play. I'll enter the store carrying this. "I found this on the street, and I was wondering what it would be worth?" is what I'll ask, and with that the seed is planted. Got it? I don't. God, you're slow. Just imagine you're the jeweller from a week earlier. His chance to score big has come. He's thinkin' to himself: "Banzai!" What do you think he does next? He's gonna try and buy my earring, duh! He'll probably make some cheap offer, like 1000 yen or something. Of course, I'll just laugh his offer off. This'll make him panic a little probably try and raise his offer three to five-fold. - We'll make a profit at 5000 yen! - No way. You already said you'd pay hundred times that! The basis of any good scam is exploiting the enemy's desires to their utmost limit. Well, this'll be your debut as a swindler, though. It's a little low, but lets set our price at 500,000 yen. So what do I do then? You act like your nose is bleeding. If the jeweller notices he's been had, it'll already be too late. Which one of us will take the rap when either of us slips up? We'll be fine. If the jeweller gets caught in a scam, he'll lose all credibility. More than anything he won't want people to know how greedy he really is. Okay, let's start preparing. First clothes, then a business card. - Lookin' spiffy! - Yeah, you found some good stuff! - That's a stylist for ya! - Here. "Mune Kirinokoji" Hey… Isn't this a bit much? We gotta go hard or go home! What happens if they call this number? They'll reach the Ugandan embassy. Look! That guy at the display case. Target acquired. Off you go! Looks like it went well! I think so! Dunno if I really looked like a rich guy, but… Our week of dreams and hopes begins now. Do we gotta week an entire week? If we move too quick it'll seem too good to be true. Hey, which one is Scorpius? I wonder if we can see it today… Do you see those three stars lined up there? - Where? - Over there. You see that stovepipe? If you draw a straight line upwards you'll see a star that shines brighter than the rest. That's Antares. How do you know these things? Spent many nights alone as a kid. So I got this book on constellations… Hello? No, I can't now. I said I can't… It's impossible, so don't. Huh? No one. I was thinking of stepping out for a sec. No, my sister's place. I do have a sister! Did I not tell you? She moved here from the countryside all of a sudden. Yeah, I'm from Tokyo, my sister's from the countryside. It's not so weird! I'll give you a call the day after tomorrow, okay? Your boyfriend? Everything cool? In this corner of my room rather than cry and moan In a sea of stardust I wanna swim all on my own I pluck an apple and bite it but it's actually kinda sour Just like my memories they can be bitter and dour If I look back on yesterday it's nothing but a faint mirage Every time I close my eyes a big blue sky opens up Way far off in the distance You might see an aurora glistening As you open up a map You'll always catch a dream Let's go to Niagara Maybe Napoli or Milan The sun is above us Dancin' in Rio de Janeiro With the world's reed pipe You can see every tone - One day I'm sure - One day I'm sure, one day I'm sure - I'll sail away - Sail away - And find love - Someone to hold and love - Until I find the place - Where we'll be able to meet Touch shoulders in Tahiti Link arms in Paris In vast Siberia Perhaps you and me In the far off desert we might find a rainbow What if you and I forever the two of us What if you and I forever the two of us Let's wait here for the right moment. You wanna eat something nice tonight? French food? Something else? Oh, I'm easy so long as the menu is. Excuse me, sir. Ah, how can I help you? I wanted to ask about this… Ah, what about it? Well, I found this, so… I thought I'd come in and check what if it's worth anything. Miss, apologize me asking, but… why would you think this is worth anything? Oh, it's not so much that I think it's worth a lot, but… I was just curious how much I could get for it. Well, I was gonna say… I think it might be worth about 2000 yen, but… that's if it was a complete set. Just one of these, hmm… Well if you'll allow me to speak frankly… I don't think it's worth anything as is. But you know, if you look at the craftmanship right here. I just thought to myself it looks quite well made. I mean, look at how bright it is. Well, if you would like me to, I could get it appraised for you. I see. Then, please. How'd it go? It cost me 2000 yen to get it appraised. - Did he bite? - Nope. - Wonder why… - Maybe he forgot? Maybe. Alright, time to shake the tree. Tree? Mister Kirinokoji, could you go in again tomorrow? "Still haven't found anything?" Just complain a little. Let's up the price, too. Say you're willing to pay two million yen. - You want me to go? - There's no point unless it's you. Hey. Remember me? Ah, yes, of course I do. Well, how about it? The earring. Did you find a matching pair? I really want you find one. I'd be willing to pay up to two million yen for it. As a matter of fact… Mister Kirinokoji. We wouldn't think about making an unreasonable profit off our clientele. The value of these earrings is far lower than what you're offering. However, in order to find these we've had to put in some time and effort… wich of course comes at a price. A small fee of 10,000 yen. 10,000 yen? I understand how you feel, but… We can't in good conscience accept a penny more. Looks like these are pretty common, huh? Shouldn't you know these things as a stylist? I'm just third-rate! Even so, 10,000 yen is a bit much, don't you think? He sized you up. Didn't you try and bargain? What, after offering two million? How could I? Let's see, we put in 2000 yen, another 2000 yen for the appraisal fee. - The third earring was… - 10,000 yen. Fee for renting the suit was another 10,000. Another 8000 for the tie and such. - What about the business cards? - 2000 yen. This is what we've got left. You can still use this, so I'll subtract it. Can't use the business cards, though. You can wear the earrings, though. They're kinda cheap, but sure. Kinda pricey for cheap things. Can you use all three? I only have two ears. You can have one. You home? You high again? Aiwa. I'm in a bad mood. What happened? One of my gigs got canceled. Nothing seems to be working out. Yeah, this weather is kind of a downer, huh? I mean, for me at least. There's no need to blame it all the rain. It's not like I was planning to go on a picnic. Can't you meet up with your guy? Nah, no way. You think I can face a man looking like this? But I'm a man. There's men and then there's men. Then what do you wanna do? I just wanna release some tension. How? I wanna make a big score. It's the only way. A big score? We need to stop wasting time! Don't you agree? Sure… So… What do you wanna do? You ever hear about this flat in Nogizaka called Xanadu? - No. - It's very luxurious. You can tell just by the name, right? Yeah. We'll pick out some rich bastard and sneak into their room when they're gone. - Then what? - Isn't it obvious? We grab their money or anything we can sell off. Isn't that just plain theft? Well, yeah. What's wrong? How is it different from what we've been doing? Speak for yourself! Oh? I thought we were partners. Yeah, I guess it just sorta ended up like that. So, why stop now? I dunno… I don't think it'll be easy to break into a fancy flat like that. Well, yeah. That's why we need a proper plan. I already have one, though. You do? There's a buzzer downstairs that you can press to be let in. So as soon as someones buzzes you in, the door unlocks. So there's no way to get in if no one's home? Pretty much. Then that means we can't steal anything, right? Phew, that's a relief! What are you talking about? You can get in if you have a key. How do we get a key? Let me explain. First we'll sneak in as someone else gets buzzed in. - Oh, easy. - Not really. Just following a person, it kinda feels like you're sneaking around, right? They'll soon notice and think you're suspicious. Plus there's a receptionist next to the entrance, too. They will think you're suspicious, as well. - Then… - However! There's a party every month at the Xanadu. Where a huge crowd gathers at this one apartment. The Ikegami place. It won't be strange if you just sorta flow in as one of the guests. But if they're having a party, they'll be home, right? That's 'cause our target is a different apartment. Just listen for a sec. I'm trying to explain this to you in the proper order. First we gotta get inside. Then, we get our hands on a key. How? Who else but the tenant would have a key? The concierge. -We're gonna pick it off the concierge? -Yeah. But if he notices it's gone he'll just change the locks, right? So we make an imprint of the key. While the concierge is around? The concierge at that place drinks beer every evening. There'll definitely be a moment where he goes to take a leak. That's our chance. Whose key? Good question. Once every week, during the evening there's someone who leaves their apartment. Yamanouchi. We need an imprint of their key. - Who'll go? - The both of us. Do we really both have to go? - Then you'll go alone? - Ah, no, let's go together! Once we get the key that'll be that, but we have to make sure that both Ikegami's party and Yamanouchi leaving the apartment fall on the exact same day. The party takes place every 15th and Yamanouchi leaves the apartment every Saturday. So, Saturday the 15th. Next month. Which means we have to make our first move on the 15th of this month. This is scary! Since we're gonna have to mingle at the party we better make a good impression. You wanna rent that same suit again? Mister Kirinokoji. - It's Fujita. - Come on in. Thanks. Yeah man, it was great! Ah, please, go ahead. - He's not drinking. - That's weird. I'll lure him out, the rest is up to you. Aaah, I'm stuck! Sorry, but I can't get it off. Oh my, how did that happen? Aah! You're gonna tear it! Please be careful. There, all good. You not havin' any beer tonight? Huh? Ah, no, doc told me I had to quit. - Why? - Bad liver. Oh my, that's no good. But, why… do you know I love beer? - Well, take care of yourself! - Thanks. This looks close, right? Ah, maybe this one? Don't you think this one's better? Well, this part's a little different. We're never gonna find an exact copy. We just gotta shave this part off. It's not just that part, look. - This part needs to go, too. - Ah, you're right, there's a dent. Well, we still have a month left. So let's take our time. With? Yes. Yeah. Right… Now? Okay. Then… Meet you at Satin Street? - You going out? - Just for a sec. It's showtime! - Iida. - Come in. Ah, go ahead. - My heart… - You're fine. "I'm still young," right? Hey. What? Ah, never mind. Hey! Hey! - What? - I need to go to the toilet. Oh come on, just hold it! I can't! I'm too nervous! Geez, alright already. I think it's over there. Hurry back! Hey! Miss Rumi? Rumi! Hush! Open up. Just undo the lock. There is no lock! Stop! Don't make any more noise! Now what? It won't budge. Don't you have anything there you can use? I'll go look for something. Where are you going? I'll be back soon. Hey? Rumi? You smokin' again? I always feel like a smoke when I drink. It's fine once in a while, right? That's whay you say, but I don't love it. You finally quit, too. The wine was good, huh? Yeah, expensive though. What was it called? A château or something, they said. Are those more expensive? Kinda, yeah. Well, as long as it's good. Three times as tasty, ten times as pricey. You want another drink? - Now? - Yeah. Or… Do you wanna do something else? You wanna do it? You? I'm kinda sleepy. What the...? This door's stuck again. Always the same shit! Isn't this place supposed to be top of the line? You should talk to the concierge. Can't you do it? It's under your name, after all. What's that matter? Just use the other bathroom tonight. Leave the door for tomorrow. Let's go to bed. Who is it? Don't you know what time it is? What's the meaning of this? Sorry for disturbing you so late, sir. The concierge asked me to come up. 'Cause you see, starting tomorrow we're gonna be very busy with construction work for the next 2 weeks. So we wouldn't be able to send anyone up for things like this in a while. That's why we're going around today, offering our services where necessary. If it's inconvenient - should I come back in two weeks? - Ah, no no. I can't wait two more weeks, so... Hey, where's the usual guy? - Something happen to the old guy? - Ah, you see… - Ah, well, he quit, actually. - Oh, I see. Seems he wanted to open a ramen shop! I see. - You wanna go some time? - Sure, if it's with you. - What're you doing? - Ah, yes yes, just a sec. Uh, well, just be quick about it, okay? - We were sleeping, so… - Yes yes, won't take long. You idiot! What're you doing? Let's get out of here. Those people are in the bedroom right now, but who knows when they might come and check. So hurry! You really screwed up this time, you idiot! Thanks for saving my ass again! At least we didn't come back empty-handed! It was already stolen goods, though. - Who is it? - It's me. What is it now? - I wanted to see you. - W-what should I do? - You don't have to go. - No, I do. Who's that? - Guy from the first floor. - What were you doing? Nothing. Then why'd he look like he just took a bath? - I dunno. - What was going on here? I told you already, nothing! And stop being so rude about it! Tonight? Okay. - That's Corona Borealis over there... - We had a fight. Oh? - Over you. - Why? He asked me what you are to me. Shoulda just told him I'm your partner in crime. He doesn't know I'm a criminal, though. Shouldn't you be able to confide in your lover? Could you confess to your lover you're a criminal? Aren't relationships built on honesty? That's the one thing they're not built on! You just don't understand. Yeah, I guess I don't. I wrote him a letter. I said I wrote a letter. What did you write? "I never wanna see you again." That's not all… but it's too harsh to say out loud. It'll be over as soon as he reads it. So it's a breakup letter? I kinda regret it, though. I feel like I don't want him to read it now. Maybe he already did? I sent it out this morning, though. The earliest it'll get delivered would be tomorrow morning, I think. That's good. So call him and tell him: "Please don't read that letter." If it was you and someone told you "Don't read that letter" Would you just leave it at that? Let's stop that letter from being delivered. How? We go there when it's about to be delivered and then steal it from his mailbox. That's a criminal offense! You don't wanna go up against the Postal Service! This is small time compared to what we've been doing. All I'm doing is retrieving my own letter. Oh, so you're going then? Cool. I'm no good! It has to be you! Why do I need to get involved? This is your fight. Please. No. No way. Let's figure out a way - to stop him from reading the letter. - Like how? Let's say that, before I sent out the letter I went to my friend who works at a pharmaceutical company to hang with her at the lab. While waiting for my friend I wanted to re-read the letter, so I took it out and knocked over a beaker that was sitting on the table. But the insides spilled all over the letter, and it dried almost instantly, so I paid it no mind and I put the letter back in the envelope. Then on my way home, I put it in the mail. However... After mailing out the letter, I told my friend about the beaker and her jaw dropped! Cause inside that beaker, you see, was a newly discovered virus, more deadly than AIDS. One touch is enough! You'll be dead as a doornail! Are you okay? You didn't touch it, did you?! I'm making this up, remember? Anyway, we'll just tell him "Please don't open that enevelope, and burn it." You think he'll buy it? - I did. - You sure did. Dunno about him, though. Was this the only thing that got delivered? Let's make sure we're there for the next delivery. It's sure to be in there. We're going back? I'm out. Hey, you live here? Who, me? Um… You were here yesterday, too. Me? You like letters, huh? Who, me? There were some letters stolen here yesterday. Any idea who might've done it? Me? I don't see anyone else here! What's that letter there? I… Uh… Ah, something I ordered, uh… Actually, my friend… Would you mind coming to the station with me? Me? Please, wait! Uh… I have my reasons! Everyone has their reasons. You're free to tell me about them at the station. No, you're wrong! This is serious! This letter, it's… It's infected! - What? - Infected! It's swarming with bacteria from a research lab! Really bad ones, too! So that's why I need to burn this right away! I see… Then how are you holding it in your hands? I'm immune. Why don't we see how much of that is true, shall we? My friend… She dropped a beaker on it. And then, uh… Um… Ah, she went to hang at this lab, at a pharmaceutical company. And… That's how the bacteria got on this letter. Which is why this letter has to be destroyd. Do you know the name of this virus? Ah, I don't. What happens if someone is infected? You'll definitely die! Well, we can't have that. I'm not seeing any symptoms. Well, for now we'd better get this letter examined. We have to burn this as soon as possible! I'll do it! I would like to examine it, though. It's my job, after all. You'll get infected! He was telling the truth. We found a terrifying virus on the letter. Ah, no, it's alright. You can't get infected from touching the envelope. The problem lies inside. I burned it, so you can relax. This fine young man managed to prevent an epidemic. Should we give him a commendation? Ah, no, I'm good. Can… Can I go home now? - It's fine, right? - Yeah, go ahead. What kinda bacteria was it? Well… I think it was a "Quaver's Lorrel"-type. "Quaver's Lorrel"... - I see… Okay, I'm going home. - Ah, wait. I would like to ask you… That letter, who sent it? Your sister? - Ah, no. - Girlfriend? Something like that. Someone important to you, huh? Ah… Yeah. You're… How do I put this? I don't know if you're a fool or just a plain good guy. Hey you won't believe this, but that letter was actually infected! What are you saying? That was just some nonsense story. But a medical expert at the police station examined it! He said he found a bacteria on the letter! Even called knew the name of the virus! - What was it? - I think… "Quaver's Lorrel". Weird name, huh? "Quaver's Lorrel"... Quaver's Lorrel… Oh I see, that doctor's pretty quick-witted, huh? I bet he read the letter and instantly knew what was going on. So he got rid of it. So you're saying he was lying? Swap the first letters of "Quaver's Lorrel" for me. Quaver's Lorrel... Lo… Lover's… Qua… Oh. Looks like there's some cops out there with a sense of humor, too. Did he say anything else? He said about me… that he couldn't tell whether I was a fool, or just a plain good guy. A fool? That's harsh! A fool, or a good guy… I see… Could you maybe not chew gum when we do this? Ah, I didn't realize. You know, you're pretty handsome. You just realized? Yeah. What if your boyfriend walks in on us? It's okay. I'll write him a letter. I won't steal it back this time. I won't ask. Let's quit. Crime doesn't pay, anyway. Let's do something else, together. Like what? Let's start by living together. You can teach me all about the stars. You wanna move in with me? - Or do you want me to move in with you? - Well, there's my mom, so… I'm thinking of buying you a ring. Thanks! But don't overdo it, okay? - Hey. - What? When you go buy a ring, they usually show you a bunch, right? What if I stick a piece of gum underneath the counter like so, buy one ring, and stick another one to the gum. Then I go in, and retrieve it, right? The one you buy should be cheap, then. And we stick an expensive one to the gum. Which jeweller should we go to? Probably a different one from last time. - Yeah, we should probably go to Ginza. - Ginza? I know the perfect jeweller on Miyuki Road. Which one? Translation by C. Vanstiphout
