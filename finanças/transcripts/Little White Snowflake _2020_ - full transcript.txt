Anyway, she's fucking wasted at this point, right? She's doing this shit, you know what I mean. Honestly, I'm not complaining. Nice. But dude, that was not even craziest part. Yo, Chris. What's going on? What's up? So anyway, I say to her, "How are you doing." Anyway, she said to me over this couch, she lays down. She's like about to pass out, right? And she's like, "Hey Chris, why don't you come like lay down with me?" - Whoa! - I know, I know. And I'm like, "I'm so high." Hey, what's going on, baby? - So here I am- - Hey, Chris. Thinking, hey... Thinking something's gonna come with this moment. And she turns over and just throws up all over me. It was like chunky and shit? Yes, it was chunky and shit. Fucking disgusting. I could have lived without that image, Chris. Oh my God. It was worse than- - Hey, hold up. Do you know what time Kyle and Hayden are gonna get here? I've no idea. I mean, they said earlier, they'd definitely be here, so... - Okay, so they will be here? - Yeah, for sure. Perfect. Just making sure. You think Kyle knows how fucked up Sawyer's already? Sawyer's always fucked up at a party like this. True. Whose house was it that one time when she got really drunk and then she like fell in the pool? Oh, oh shit. Was it like... I don't think Hayden was there for that one though. I don't think so. I think that was during the whole Tucker thing. Yeah. Was it Mark? It might've been Mark. It was definitely Mark. It was definitely Mark, without a doubt. Fuck Mark though. Are you tired? Huh? Are you tired, man? Yeah. I just haven't been out this late in awhile, you know. Yeah, for sure. Hey, I heard this party was gonna to be like a lot tamer than some of the other ones lately. I don't know if you're freaked out by that or anything. No, I'm good. You? I mean, you know, I'm not a big party person. Yeah. So yeah. I'm a little freaked out. Oh yeah, I got your back, bro. - Thanks, buddy. - No problem. God, I bet Donnie's already passed out somewhere. How do you think Chris is doing? I don't know. Hey, remember that one time that girl threw up on him? Oh fuck! Yeah. Honestly, I bet that didn't even happen though. Come on. We both know Chris never lies. Yeah, I guess that's true. Who do you think is the biggest liar? I don't fucking know. Hey, are you spending the night tonight? My mom just got back from the beach. I don't know. My dad's been like getting freaked out recently, with me like being out late and stuff. Yeah, for sure. I can ask though. Cool. Appreciate it. Kyle, yo, you made it. Oh my God. It's been like what? Like freshman year? How are you, Tori? How do I look? Very fucked up. Hey, this is Hayden. You're Tucker's younger brother, right? - Yeah. - Super cool guy. He was my chemistry tutor. Nice. I'm sorry for your- - Do you know where Chris and Donnie are? I think they're over by the bench. - Thanks, Tori. - Yeah. - Hey! - Oh, shit! - You guys decided to show up. - Good to see you too, Donnie. - What's going on, baby? - What's good. - What's up? - What's going on, Hayden? What you guys up to? Nothing, we're just chilling. Party got kinda much. Oh, a little bit much for Donnie? Hold up. Not too much for me, too much for Chris. Hey, hold on. Who's the one who dragged us over here? Shut the fuck up, man. Hey, you might wanna... Oh, fuck! Yeah! I'll go deal with that. I'll get back in a few minutes. Damn, pop another quickie? Hey, fuck you, all right? - Hey, Kyle. - Hey. Have you seen Sawyer? I think she's somewhere around here. Huh? Way to fucking help. Hey, do you want a drink or something? I'm good, don't worry. Are you all right? Hey, babe? Are you okay? You wanna go somewhere more quiet? Yeah. Come on. You're good. Come on. Okay. You all right? Yeah, no. I'm good. Tori said I'm okay to sleep over. Okay. Are any guys sleeping over? Yeah, I think just Jay and Matt and Ben? And Tom might sleep over too. It's fine. I'm not jealous of him. Oh, come on, babe. I'm serious. Look, just call me if you need anything, okay? I'm not gonna need anything. Why can't you just sleep over? Listen, Tori is like so cool with it. She wouldn't even care. You know I can't. Hayden might need somewhere to stay tonight. Yeah. How's he doing? He's good. He's good. He's doing a lot better. That's good. So do you wanna come over tomorrow night then? Sure. Okay. And listen, you don't even have to worry about Tom and me, 'cause like I'm literally falling asleep as we speak. I'm going. I'm sleeping. I'm sleeping right now. I'll see you tomorrow, okay. Fuck! Wait, Teller actually did that shit? Yo, like he was beating the absolute shit out of me. Like fucking me up. Like. That's the last time you take my rice crispies you son of a bitch- - Yeah. Yes, yes. Just like that shit, bro. Like fucking me up, dude. - Kinky. - No. Yeah. Can we keep it PG please? For sure. No, fuck that. Come on. Hold on, Kyle. Not in front of everybody. - Chill. - That's right, right. Oh yeah, like he was really fucking me up, dude. It was pretty- Yo, Chris. How's your video going? I think it's turning out pretty good so far, but like, dude, I have no idea what the plot should be. How the fuck are you making a movie with no plot? I mean, it's no fucking sense. Hey, dumb ass. It's called avant garde. Dude, he just made that fucking word up. Like, that does not exist. Nope, quit. No, buddy. No, quit while you're at it. What do you mean? Nah, it's for real. What? Donnie, Donnie, avant garde is like, it's like art that didn't have to make sense. Like abstract. You know what I mean? That sounds pretentious as fuck. You can have some shots of us skating. I mean, yeah. And it'd be a lot cooler if you clowns could actually land something. - Whoa! - Oh! - Slow it down. - Who are you calling a clown? I can do kick flips, so that's one up on you. No, Donnie, yo. A kick flip is not when you kick the board from its bottom to its top. You have to act it. But didn't I just say the word kick and flip in there? So I'm doing both just as- - Come on, Donnie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you have to like stay on the board the whole time. You can start and then- All these fucking made up ass rules means non skaters. I don't wanna hear that shit. You sound like a real fucking dumb ass right now. - You know that shit? - Fuck you, dude. Fucking dickheads. You guys wanna like get ice cream or something? I mean, sure. - Am I the only one hungry? - I just think like... No, sure. Yeah, that's fine. Morty's? Morty's? That closes at nine now actually. Fuck, what even is open right now? Cold's. Yeah, Cold's is open, so I would. Sweet. What time is it? 11:27. Fuck! So Kyle, what's up with you and Sawyer? You guys good? - Yeah. - Well, hold up. Did something happen? - Were you not here for that? - Oh yeah. I think you were like in the mountains for that. Shit, yeah. I was in the mountains. All right, so what happened? Okay, like basically, there's this guy, Tom. And like, I guess him and Sawyer kind of had a thing before Sawyer and I were dating, and I don't know. Sometimes I just get the vibe that he's like still trying to get with her. It's weird. Okay. So like what does he do? Well, like, there's like little things. Like there's just one face he makes where he's like... You'd have to see it to like understand it, but like... Okay, okay. I hear you, right? I respect where you're coming from. But are you telling me honestly, with your whole heart, that you think he's trying to steal your girlfriend because he looks at her? Okay. Fuck you. There's other stuff. Like there was this one time where, like they got really drunk and they went up to Tom's room and he like took his pants off in front of her. Okay. You could've definitely opened with that shit. I get it. It's a little fucked up. So, but like, were you there? Well, no. But like Mary told me about it. So like... So like, we don't know what happened? I mean, I feel like Mary wouldn't lie about something like that. And like given Tom and Sawyer's history, and that Tom is a major douchebag, I wouldn't put it past him to do something. Oh yeah. Tom is kind of a douche. So like, what happened between you guys? Are you guys good? I mean, you know, there was this time, like last week, at Hayley's house, when she went to a party and like got super drunk, and apparently Tom grabbed her thigh while they were there. And Mary told me about it and I asked Sawyer about it. And obviously she said it didn't happen. But then like, there's kind of a big thing. And then, I don't know. She says I'm just jealous 'cause they were a thing before we dated, and they're still friends, but like I just, I think it's weird that you'd still be friends with someone... No yeah, I think it's kind of really silly... I mean, I don't know. I'm still friends with Maddie. It's not that big of a deal. We're cool. I mean, that's kind of different though. - All right. - If you say so my guy. - It's not a big deal. - Sawyer and I are good now. So, it doesn't even matter. Okay. Well that's good. So Hayden, you still trying to get with Sarah Herman? Oh! It's like, its weird. Sweet! Yes, sir! Big dipper. Little dipper. How does that look like a dipper? Well, if you put a line through all the stars and made an outline of it, it looks like a dipper. Maybe I just don't know what dipper is then. It's like the thing you make mac and cheese in. Oh, like a pot? No. Not that. It's like something used for soup, like a ladle. Oh! What the fuck is... Hayden, you good? Yeah. Sorry, I'm just tired. Yeah, you're like never out this late. Nah, I should probably get home actually. My dad's probably pissed right now. Alright, fellas. Pack it up. Ugly, ugly, ugly. Hey, Chris. Come on. The stars will still be out when you get home. Oh, fuck it. Oh there's the dipper again. All right. Hey, you did a really good job tonight. Thanks. No, seriously. Like I know it's been a really rough couple of months and I'm really proud of you. Thanks for being there. Of course. You know, we all are if you... Do you wanna talk about it? Nah, it's... It's cool. - Another time. - Yeah. All right, well, goodnight. Yeah, sure. Are you free tomorrow? Yeah. Wanna hang? Sure. Got it. Goodnight, bud. Sweet. Where were you, Hayden? I was just out with some friends. Who? Kyle, Chris and Donnie. We just went to a party. Did you eat dinner? No, but there was some ice cream and snacks there. Was there any alcohol there? No. No. All right. Well, come with me. I was thinking that we'd see Tucker tomorrow. I had plans to see some friends tomorrow. Could I could do that too? Glad you know that you're gonna have to do both. Yeah. Okay. Is mom gonna come? No, I don't think so. Did you talk to her today? No, I didn't talk to her today. Anybody try to give you any alcohol at the party? No, dad. I already... I'm not stupid. I know how parties work. Nobody offered me alcohol. Well, would you take these leftovers up to mom? - Yeah. - I'm going to bed. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Mom, I have dinner for you. What is it? Pasta leftovers. Oh, gross. Your dad's pasta? Yeah, he offered it to me for lunch and I just told him I already ate. Why does he insist on putting fruit in the pasta? Like who thinks that red sauce and grapes taste good? I dunno. He says it's the healthiest. Hey, how was Tori's? It was okay. - It was a little much. - Yeah? Yeah. Sarah Herman was there though. That's the girl from space camp, right? No, that's Sarah Street. Which one is Sarah Herman again? I don't know if you've met her. I had her over like a month ago. Gotcha. I'm starting to remember her. You and her were trying to be a thing, right? Yeah, yeah. I wasn't really feeling it though. We talked and I just kinda decided I needed more time. Some more time? Yeah. Just more time to... Yeah. Yeah. How'd she take it? She was a little sad. The boys all say hi. Hi, boys. Oh also, Chris was asking if I could come with him on a beach trip. His parents will be there. That's a dad question. You already know he's gonna say no, though. Then I feel like you already have your answer. But mom, can you please... I really wanna go. Can you just bring it up to him? Buddy, the second your father decides to come up and talk to me, I will bring up the beach trip with Chris. Thank you. You sound tired. I'm a little tired. I'll probably go to bed soon.

I feel like most people don't even do it until the day before it's due anyway. That's what I do at least. I just straight up don't do it. Hey Kyle, are you excited for college? I mean, I guess. I still gotta pack all my shit, but like it's whatever. My roommate seems cool. What's his name? Like... Like Bryce or some shit like that? Like Zachariah. I mean, it's Zach, so close enough. But I mean he's bringing us TV so that's fun. Oh cool. So we're gonna be able to come over all the time? Will you be paying for three plane tickets to Arizona? I mean, what? It's just Arizona. It can't be that expensive. You know how far away Arizona is, right? Yeah, like, I think four hours give or take. - What? - No, buddy. Four hours? - What's up? - Four hours. Have you seen a map. Yeah, I've seen the fucking map. Have you seen the fucking map? Arizona is like a two-hour flight that costs 300 a piece. Okay, see this the response I want for my skating then. All right, dumb ass. Take that. We're fucking sorry that you're being dumb. If I start crying, will y'all call me a bitch? Being a man don't mean I can't cry. You know what I mean like... - Shut up. - You sound stupid. Don't be not here. Fuck you. When I get a fucking Ivy degree, I can't come back to y'all because y'all can't let me live my life. You know what I mean? Y'all won't look at me like the same person. Y'all are fucking assholes, man. I can't stand being around y'all. Sometimes I feel like shit around y'all. Like I'm getting emotional and shit. Good. I want you to. Now, come give me a kiss. I just wanna feel I get to, what? Hayden, you're getting in or what? No, man, I don't wanna get my hair wet. I'm seeing Tucker after this. - Here you go. - Gotcha. Thanks. Haven't had one of these in forever. Shit. Fuck. Damn. I would. I would do that. So, I gotta ask. Sarah Herman. What about it? Any second thoughts? Yeah, I get that. I get that. You know who you would like though? - Who? - Katrina Hall. Didn't Donnie like have sex with her in that parking lot or whatever? I'm pretty sure that was Anna Byers. I thought it was just a joke. Fuck, I didn't bring it up to him, but damn, Donnie. Wait, I heard my name. You got some shit? Yeah, we're talking about Anna Byers. Oh! Wait, who? What? Oh, oh, ew! Ew! Yeah. - Hey, Sawyer. - Hey guys. Where's Kyle? He's out there. Kyle, get that water out of your mouth. You don't know who's pissed in there. I'm gonna break these two up. Wish me luck, guys. Yo. Bro, chill. It's just water. But I'm all like wet now. Dude, it's only just water. It'll dry off in seconds. Yeah, but you didn't have to do that though. Huh? I'm fucking with you. I'm fine. Okay. What's up, bitch? All right, I'm going in. Take that shit. Do you have any words? Huh? Do you have any words you wanna say to your brother? Give me a hug. It's all right. I miss him too. He was a good kid. Yeah. I don't know why I did this, but I was thinking about stuff last night, and he... Remember that he told you that your principal was a vampire on your first day at school? Yeah. Well, he scared me into being a good kid. He was always doing stuff like that to try to be a good big brother. Do you remember when he beat up that one kid at the swimming hole? No, he beat up a kid at a swimming hole? Yeah, no. I must've been like eight. It was during swim practice. I was playing that imaginary game I used to always play. Hey, you guys were always playing superheroes. I remember you running around like crazy. Yeah. It was super Hayden. I was super Hayden and he was bad boy Tucker. Yeah, even though he was the bad guy, somehow from what I remember, he was always winning. Always. It was his way. So how are you playing that by yourself? He was at swim practice. Well, I was just talking to myself because he had... You were talking to yourself? Yeah, anyways, I was talking to myself- - I raised the weirdest, freaking kids. I was talking to myself and I was playing super Hayden. And this one kid. Do you remember Austin Grove? Yeah, I used to work with his dad. Austin Grove came up to me, I think with his friend, Sam, and they were laughing at me and I got really embarrassed. And anyways, Sam at one point or another pushed me down and I just remember seeing Austin, he came up, he started kicking me. And then out of nowhere, Tucker came over and he tackled Austin and it took down Sam as well. I don't know how he would've seen them, 'cause he should've been in swim practice. Wait, you gotta remember that he hated swim practice. He did? Yeah. He used to always get beat up by this kid, Jackson. Wait, what? How did no one see that? Well, I'm pretty sure that everybody saw it, but when mom and I went to go talk to the coaches about it, they said, "Boys will be boys." Is that why we moved neighborhoods? Yup. I never even knew that. Yeah, he was always trying to be a good, big older brother. And he was good at it too. Mom's got something in the fridge that I made her. Can you take it up to her? Why don't you take it to her? No, kid. I don't think that's such a good idea. Would you take it to her? - Got you something. - Please don't tell me it's more of that pasta leftovers. No, actually, I think this one's pretty good. Tell you what? I'll just have to take your word for it. What'd you do today? I went to the lake. Why? Huh? Why did you go to the lake? Oh, well, Donnie wanted to go. Plus it was free Popsicle day, so... Okay. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Make sure you take your meds, Hay. Okay. You can't do that. Hey, Hayden. How are you? I'm good, Ms. Janice. What are you boys doing up so late? Oh, sorry. I was... No, it's okay. You know you're always welcome here. It's okay. Mom, can you make us cookies? Kyle, I already made you some. You know that. Let me get them. I drew... Here you go. So Hayden, what's going on? Nothing much. I'm good, Ms. Janice. How are you? I mean, I'm a little sleepy but I'm good. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. No, it's okay, it's okay. Are you excited about senior year? Yeah, I'm just excited to get everything over with really. I heard it's the easiest year too. It definitely is. Are you excited to get him out of here? I've been waiting for all my life for this day. Mom! I'm just kidding. Hayden, how's your mom? Is she any better? Oh, she's good. She hasn't come out yet, but she's been talking to us. That's better. I mean, these things, they take time and everybody's different. I can't even imagine what I would be like in that situation. Well, tell her, when she does decide to come out that she needs to come over here and I have that bottle of Prosecco - waiting for her still, okay? - Yes, ma'am. I will. Okay, good. Are you gonna spend the night? No, I don't think I should. My dad would probably freak out if he saw me gone in the morning. Well, do you want me to call him and tell him you're with us? No, it's okay. Thank you though. I should probably be headin' out soon anyways, actually. So if you don't mind, I'll just wrap it up here with that. Come on. You've got the whole- - Sorry, I was waiting to use it for awhile. All right, well, Kyle, why don't you walk your friend outside? Let Kyle walk me outside. Walking outside. Thank you, Ms. Janice. Thank you very much. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. All right, man. I'll see you, bud. Hey, you gonna be okay? Huh? Well, I just wanted to check up with you after what happened earlier. Oh, what about it? Like the whole lake thing? No, it's fine. I don't care. Well, like Donnie was splashing you and I promise you, he was just doing it as a joke, but... Oh no, it's okay. I know how you get around water. So I wanted to make sure you were good. I'm good. Thank you. All right. Have a good night, buddy. See you, bro. Hey, Hayden. Hey, oh, thank you for the cookies. They're really good. Oh no, of course. I just wanted to say something. Okay. You know it's not your responsibility to hold your family together, right? I know. I mean, you don't have to be the strong one and be perfect all the time for your family. I mean, you need to mourn too, Hayden. My therapist had to drill that into my head when Kyle's dad left. I didn't know you saw a therapist. Oh yeah. I mean I still do sometimes and I really recommend it. Okay, Ms. Janice. I'll look into it. - Thank you. - Okay. All right. - Goodnight, Hayden. Take care. - Goodnight. Thank you, Ms. Janice. You too. All right, see you soon. Good morning. Come on. Come on. You know you wanna dance. Come on, do it. Yes! Come on! Don't you love this song? Come on. Do one twirl for me. - I wanna go back to bed. - One twirl. One twirl. That's right. Yes! Hey, I've been working out a lot more lately. You have? You're doing the workouts I gave you? No, a different one. Well, what? What is this work? I start with 10 pushups. And then 10 of the things where you put it above your head. Okay. Upper head press. Yeah. Okay, cool. 10 of those and then 10 squats and 10 curls. That is awesome. That's really good. Maybe you could add like some sit ups or something sometime. I was thinking about putting those in like next week. Yeah. Do we still have dad's pull up bar? Yeah. I think that's actually at your dad's apartment, I think. And I think that you, he would probably be happy to give that to you, I'm sure. So you can, you should call him and ask him. I think he'd love to hear from you, I'm sure. That would be great. I was thinking, do you think that Hayden like stresses about you at all? What do you mean? Well, I mean that you're gonna be leaving soon, and with everything that's happened with him, losing another, you know, I just, I don't know. I just wondered if you thought he might be stressed out about it. I mean... I think we're just friends. I mean, yeah. You think it's fine. Okay. I was just wondering. Hey, can I go to Sawyer's tonight? How late will you be? Like 10... Okay, you can go, but do not be late because I need help with my car in the morning before work, okay? Cool. Good. That's good. Just in time. Hey. I was just about to make a cake, but I need some help. Oh, I'm the help? Yes, listen. I know your mom likes to bake, so I figured there must be a baking gene somewhere in your body. So we need tools. Perfectly moist strawberry supreme. I don't have tools. Who the fuck is that? Ooh! Hi, Mikey? Don't have tools. Don't need them. Yes, thank you, Mike, for watching over us. Okay. Maybe we put the record down temporarily. - Can you find... - What am I looking for? I don't have tools. I think I have a stirrer in the drawer over there if you wanna look. Oh, here we go. Found it. Yes, yeah. Okay. So I think I have a cup in here, maybe? Yes. Okay. And, that is, that also works. - Thank you for the suggestion. - You're welcome. I don't have milk. What the fuck? How the fuck are you gonna make a cake and not have anything? Were you prepared for this at all? Listen, I do recall that I specifically said that you were the help here. What am I helping? Some milk. You're helping with milk.

Well, and I'm a fat ass, right? Look, do I need to call your parents? Shit, yeah. Go ahead. Call my dad. Okay. Hello, Mr... - McMillan. - Mr. McMillan. Mr. McMillan, I'm here with your son, Kyle. And he decided that he wanted to park in the handicap spot at my shop and he won't move his car. So I'm not gonna call the cops on him. But I think that maybe... I think that maybe it's time that you take care of this and teach your son some manners. Have a good day, sir. You guys are assholes. I should probably move my car. Y'all seen that one porno with that lady and the papas. - Yes. - The fuck. That's right, shit. Wait, actually? What the fuck? It's some ebony shit. You want anything, Kyle? Nah. I could cover you. Huh? If you don't have enough money, I could spot you some. No, you're good. I'm trying not to eat as much stuff for a bit. I'm trying to get more fit. Fuck you looking at? - See you, buddy. - All right, bro. Good to see you. - Donnie. - Peace. - What? - Come on. Uno! What? - Come on. - What? - Just like that. - This game sucks. Wait, were you just holding those cards back the whole time? Yeah. I just really wanted to get this game over with. Hey, okay, so you don't like me anymore? - Exactly. Exactly. - That makes sense. No, no, no. I should probably head home 'cause I gotta wake up early tomorrow. My sister's getting baptized, so I gotta get... I didn't know you had a sister. Yeah, she's turning four this September. - Oh. - So yeah. I don't wanna keep you out late. Hayden, how about you? I should probably be heading out soon too. Are you with your dad tonight? Yeah. Mom's gonna... Okay, no. I have a girls weekend. It's a divorced moms wine club. Okay, Kyle. That is not a divorce. It's not that, but my friend Char has a mountain place where we can go spend the night, have some super fun, it'll be good. Kyle, you told your dad that you're sleeping over tonight, right? - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Okay. All right, good. All right. Well, y'all be safe. - Okay. - Thank you. Guess I'm gonna go. I'll see you tomorrow? Right? Thanks you Ms. Janice. Goodnight. See you, Hayden. Hey. Hey. You all packed for your dad's? Yeah, I mean just for the weekend. I know. It's just that... I know. I know. You okay? Yeah, I guess. Hey, I was wondering. Maybe instead of going to dad's, I could spend the weekend at Sawyer's? I mean, look, your dad's gonna wanna see you at least part of this weekend. And I mean, you haven't seen him since graduation. I know, but I already called him and talked to him about it and he said it was fine. What? Yeah, he said he was really swamped this weekend or something. No. We went back and forth about days to switch, and this is the weekend that he picked. So he can't be like swamped, because, no. I don't know, mom. Okay. Okay. Are you okay with it? Am I okay with it? I mean, yeah, sure. Why not? That's fine. That's fine. Whatever. But you know what? Let me just call your dad real quick, because I just... Let me just... Yep, yep. Lance, I was calling just to make sure that you were not going to be seeing Kyle tonight or this weekend. He said he talked to you and that you said... Okay, no. I don't care if you're swamped. You haven't seen our son in months. Are you kidding? Are you kidding me? Yeah, I know he's about to leave for college and I know that he wants to spend time with his friends but you haven't seen him. And you can't make an argument about that because you don't care enough to see your kid anymore. Hey, ma. I'm gonna leave in a bit. Okay. All right, you know what? That sounds good, honey.

My man forgot towels existed. If I fucking put my feet in the water, will you guys be happy? - Sure. - Okay. Go for it. See? It's not that bad. Thanks, man. Goodnight. - Hey. - What's up? Were you okay today? Yeah. Why? Well, I don't know. I know you get weird around water and stuff and... No, it was fine. I just didn't wanna get wet. Yeah, for sure. It's just, my mom said something about how you might see me as like an older brother figure or something. And I just thought maybe I should act like it. Sorry. That's weird. Why is it weird? Well, I don't wanna like overstep. What? You know, like... I don't wanna take anything away from Tucker. No. - It's fine. - No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought him up. I should probably head out. My dad, he's gonna be... I've been outside for awhile. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. All right. Well, I'll see you. - See you, buddy. - Goodnight. You know what the craziest thing about Toby is? What? We actually went to preschool together and now he's doing all of this with my best friend. Wow, that is crazy. I know, right? Okay, listen. I can't find anything. What do you want? Oh, I'm good. You know, I don't think I've actually ever seen you drink before. Well, that's 'cause I don't really ever drink. What? I don't know. I thought I told you about this. I don't know. I just never thought of it. Well, I mean my... Okay, wait. Are you sure we haven't talked about this before? I am almost positive. Okay. Well, when I was like 12, my mom and dad were big drinkers and my mom decided she didn't wanna be an alcoholic. So she went off to rehab. And it was just me and my dad for awhile. And somehow he just drank more. I remember there was this girl that would always come over with him, and then they'd just drink and do shit. I don't know. It kinda fucked me up, I guess. My mom came back and heard about all the shit that my dad was doing and divorced him really quick. And then, I don't know. I don't think she ever forgave herself. She didn't forgive herself. Why? Why? For leaving me with him. For making me afraid of alcohol. Kyle, I don't think it's a bad thing to be afraid of alcohol. There's some days that I wish I could just be drunk instead of being so afraid of getting there. It's stupid. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. What? No, I'm at Sawyer's. What the fuck are you doing at the junkyard? Alright, whatever. I'll be there in like 10 minutes. What's up? See, I made those two rocks bounce off each other. Did you see that? Yeah. Was there like a reason you brought me out here or? I don't know. I just needed somebody to talk to. Okay, I mean, I get that, but like, it's the middle of the night. Teller tried to stab me. I guess threatened me or whatever, but, he actually hurt me this time. I can't do this anymore. What do you mean you can't take this anymore? I mean like I should just fucking run away, right? I mean, I should just fucking go. Nobody would give a shit if I left. Damn sure not my parents. They're not even around. And they're always just beatin' on me and Teller. I know Teller is not that much better. I know that. Yo, sometimes... Sometimes, and I know you don't mean to do it, but you act like him when you're around him. Why do you do that? Donnie, you do know like, I wasn't always the biggest kid. Actually, I used to be scrawny as fuck. I got beat up all the time for guys like your brother. I don't know. Maybe there's something about Teller. Maybe because he's older than me, but I don't know. Maybe that's why I try to be like an older brother for you and the guys. You know? Yeah. You know, I'm glad you're like that. You're like a big brother to all of us. Sometimes it kind of gets to be a lot. Especially with Hayden. I don't know what's best for him. Yeah. Fuck. Fuck, man. Hey, can I talk to you about something? Yeah. Promise not to like laugh or anything? Not too much. Okay. I'm really fucking jealous of Tom. I fucking knew it. I fucking knew it. Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait. Hear me out. Him and Sawyer have a history together. He's hot as fuck. I mean, come on. Yo, yo, listen, you fucking dumb ass. Sawyer loves you. Everyone knows it. It's so obvious. Who gives a shit if Tom works out? If she wanted a guy like Tom, she would be with Tom. She puts in a lot of effort to be with you, man. And that's the problem. Sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough for her. See, that's just more bullshit. Like, I get that you don't think you're shit, but like she thinks you're incredible. You mean the world to her, man? Yeah. I guess it's pretty stupid, huh? See? See how stupid it sounds when you say it out loud? Say it out loud. You fucking bozo. You fucking idiot. ♪ Ebony ♪ Hey man, we gotta get up. Gotta get up. Shit. Shit. Shit. It's cool, man. No, Kyle. If Teller finds out I snuck out, he's gonna tell my dad. All right, go. What the fuck? Mom and dad are not home. Make some breakfast. I don't know who the fuck you think you're pushing like that though. I don't know who the fuck... Hey, hey, chill. I'm gonna fuck you up. - Let's wait for the cops. - I'm big enough to fuck you up. Remember the doctor said I'll always be two inches bigger than you? He also said your dick was the proper size- - Hey, shut the fuck up, man. You still gotta make breakfast though. All right, give me a second. ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ Hey, Donnie. If you ain't part of this, I swear to God I'm gonna have sex with your mom. Dude, go ahead. She might like it more than what she gettin' now anyway. - Oh. - Yeah, what the fuck. Hey Donnie, if you're not gonna do it, can I have a turn up there? No, like, how should I even go about this? All right, stamp your foot down. Just bend your knees. Fuck it, I don't even wanna do it anymore. Awesome. Does that mean I get a turn up there? No. Shut up. Donnie, you realize how stupid you look on this? You're gonna be so embarrassed when you see how this video turns out. You can just edit this shit out though, right? No, I'm not gonna edit it out because you're being a bitch right now and you deserve it. Fuck you, bro. Fuck all y'all. You're some assholes. - Just fucking go. - Fuck you. Just do the fucking trick. - Oh, Donnie. - Damn. Are you good? I'm straight. - Are you sure? - I'm good. You need a hand? Hey, your elbow. Is your elbow okay? You don't want ice or anything? I'm cool. I'm straight, I'm clear. I'm cool. - You don't look good. - I'm good. Shit. Donnie ate shit. You want to have cookies? Wanna hit? No snitching this time. I don't even know why you like this shit so much. 'Cause you're a badass. What? 'Cause you're badass. You know dad got me into that shit, around about 16th birthday. There's a lot of shit he don't know he's doing wrong. What? Huh? Yo. Is that mom? Huh? Nah, nah, nah, nah. Just a friend. You still coming through tonight, right? Nah, it's just gonna be like 15 or so. Not a lot of people could come through. Fuck. I mean, it's up to you honestly. No shit. All right, I'll see you then. Okay, bye. Who was on the phone? Just my boy, Justin. We're gonna have a little get together later on tonight. It's gonna be at the house. Just don't tell mom. All right, cool, cool. So when's mom and dad coming home? Shit. Damn this bad. Open the window. Like fucking spray Fuck you. Some perfume or something, man. Shouldn't be with your friends right now? I think Kyle's with Sawyer, and Chris's at the dentist or some shit like that. What about Hayden? Me and Hayden aren't really the friends who could just hang out by themselves, you know? Is he doing all right though? What do you mean? Like the whole Tucker thing? Oh! Yeah, that's not really something we talk about, you know? So like, can we do something? You can go ahead and do something. I'm probably gonna stay around and clean up. Please, we never do anything. I'm a stay around the house and clean up. Donnie? Oh, shit. Hey Maddie. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. I'm great actually. You? I'm all right. Nice, nice. So yeah... How is that even possible? Don't ask me. I just... Because you just, oh my God. I miss talking to you, Donnie. Me too. So, I have this big get together at my house next week sometime. Do you think you guys could come? Oh, you mean like Hayden and Kyle and Chris? Yeah, yeah. I think it would be fun. What day is it? Yeah, it's next Friday. I think the 20th. Can I give you like a maybe? Okay. So how's your mom been? She's good. She's working a lot 'cause my dad got laid off- - Your dad got laid off? Yeah, but he's like, he's looking for new jobs and stuff. I'm sorry. We're good. I mean, it's kinda just both of us in the house by ourselves. But I'm not really home like that, so it's just... That's good though. It's not necessarily just because of Teller. I just don't like being home like that, you know? It's dirty as shit. Then clean it. I mean... - I guess I could clean it. - Dude. Dude, clean your house. It's your house. I know it's my house, but like I... It's not just on me. You know, I really did miss you. Yeah, I missed you too. We should hang out again, like, as friends. Yeah, of course. All right. Bye, Donnie. Bye, Maddie. Okay. Now one more. Wait, hold on. We do that one Okay. We have the weirdest humor out of everybody. I know. Wait, wait. Do it again but like, it's like say a famous quote or something. All right, all right. Cool, cool. Humanitarianism is the expression of stupidity and cowardice. What is that? Adolf Hitler. What? Yeah. How do you know that? Remember Ms. Rowan's literacy test, right? Yeah. The one at the end of the year? Well, I had the one we had to like write a speech on Hitler's impact through speech or whatever. And I got Hitler. You got Hitler? I got Gandhi, how'd you end up with Hitler? Dude, yo. I don't know. I just did. That is so funny. Hey, what's Teller doing downstairs? I think he's throwing a party or something. Can we go? I guess. I mean, we don't know anybody there. It's really just like his college friends or whatever. Okay, yeah. But it'll still be fun. Let's go. Come on. He's not even that cool. I'm gonna look for Teller and make sure nobody breaks anything. Yo, Teller. Yo. Oh, dog, you came. Hey, dad's drinking stock in the fridge and I've got some friends coming over with some more, so you have anything. All right, cool. What do you want? I'll just have whatever you have. See. This is what I'm talking about. Everybody already knows each other. It's awkward as shit. - I don't know, man. - It's still pretty fun. You wanna make a scene? Yeah. Hey, give me more of these. I'm gonna chug a shit ton of this. Don't do that. Hey yo, let's get this party... Yeah, bro. That was stupid as hell, man. Shut up. Shut up. How many did you have? Like 15. Damn. You know you're gonna feel it in the morning, right? - Hey, hold up. - Yo, who's this? Oh, shit. This is my little brother. I'm babysitting him. Is he like a fucking junior or something? - What's he doing here? - I don't know how the fuck... I don't know why he even came down. Get him the hell out of here, dude. Hey, bro. Go upstairs and play some video games or something. Fucking lightweight. He's such a lightweight. Whatever. Where's Chris? I don't know. Maybe he left. A lot of people downstairs are leaving now, so you should probably go see him off. Oh, so I can go downstairs now? - Hey man, I'm sorry. - That was fucked up, Teller. Why the fuck would you do that? But what would you have done? I would literally just claim I have a brother I like being around. Who the hell says I like being around you? Fuck you! - Answer me, dog. - Get off me. Yo. Yo, my bad, man. I really didn't mean that. Yo! Shit. Teller. Teller. Teller. What the fuck! Yo! Wake up, dude. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, what's up? I woulda woke you up earlier, but most stores were closed last night and I had to go out this morning. You're totally fine. It's cool. All right. Feeling all right? Yeah. Yeah. My head is just killing me. Yeah. Yo. What's up? I'm a be honest with you. I thought you like left. You thought I left? Like for good. Like I thought you thought you killed me and just ran away. No, man. You were definitely breathing. I just went out last night to get some stuff to help you out. It seems like somebody used up all the BAND-AIDs. Well, I got this. Oh, shit. Where did you get that from? Yeah, I fell off my skateboard. Yo. I'm a be real wit' you. You're one of the toughest people I know. You know that, right? For real? Yeah, man. Way tougher than any of your other friends. You know we had to grow up way tougher. You know, with like... With like dad and stuff, right? Yeah, man. That's what I was gonna say. Especially that boy, Hayden, you gotta get him out of his shell. You gotta be the one to push him into that vulnerable place. Everybody else is too pussy to do it. But you, you way tougher than them, man. For real. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm gonna get some rest, all right? All right, man. - You never get in, do you? - The water? No. How come? I just don't like it. You do know how to swim though, right? Like this one used to swim. Oh no, yeah. I was on the swim team in our old neighborhood. You know it's not even that cold in there. I just don't feel like it. I mean, I put my feet in. Donnie, what the hell. Come on. Donnie, what the fuck, man? What the fuck! Hayden, I'm so sorry. Fuck you, Donnie. No idea, I was just trying to help you out. - Fuck you. - Stop, stop, stop, stop. I thought that would be a good idea. Fuck you.

You're gonna still play with us? What are you doing? Give me a second. God! - Hunter, by the way. - Chris. Graham. What are you doing? You're filming us or something? Yeah. I'm filming you. I don't know. I try to get like cuts of people like having fun and stuff, like skateboard videos. It's kind of weird man, but I mean, all right, do whatever. You say you do skateboard videos. Yeah. Like bubble. I felt bad though, because the other day I went back and I realized that they're actually playing these songs. What's playing out? You want us to do a little right around? Yeah, I think like, can you do any tricks or anything? Like, I could probably like a couple like pop shovets. I can do the trade flips probably, you know, get some good in there. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, if you're gonna do all that, then just go around the outside. Okay. And then I'll just come up like right behind you. You might wanna stay back a little bit 'cause you know, it takes a lot of room to do these moves. Okay. Was that good? Yeah, sure. I thought you said that you like skated. I do. Okay, but like, I dunno. I thought it would be... I thought you were better than that. Like, no offense, man. You know what? Harder to do it in real life than on skate through. Okay, man? Oh! Okay. Yeah. I'm trying my hardest here, okay? Just make me look cool from close. Yeah, yeah. I will. I got you. I got it. You wanna hear the craziest part about the whole story? So she was sitting on me, right? Like just full on straddling and I'm so fucking high, I can't even get hard, like not even a little bit. So I tried to fuck her with a limp ass dick. Jesus Christ! What the fuck! And then there's this one time with... Oh, fuck what's her... Oh, Ms. Grayson. Wait, Ms. Sheena Grayson? Yeah. Sophomore year? Yeah, man. Wait. You're Kyle, Kyle, right? Shit, I thought I recognized you, man. Yeah. She was crazy. Crazy, but fine as hell. If I got the opportunity to just, that would've been so delicious. Maybe Ms. Carey, maybe. Oh shit. I had her sophomore year. - Really? - Yeah. Hey where'd you end up anyways? I got kicked out, man. Really? Yeah, I was selling weed and they just expelled me. How do I not remember this? I don't know. It was a pretty big deal when it happened. Anyways, I'm homeschooled now. And it's like the best thing that's ever happened to me. Plus I wasn't a big fan of school in the first place. Good thing we graduated then, huh? Shit. I'm not even going to college. I'm a start selling again. The money's just too good to not. - Really? - Oh yeah. I think you might like it. Never really been into that kind of stuff. I don't know, man. Wasting an opportunity for some good cash. By the way, didn't I used to like make fun of you a little bit back in school? Yeah. You used to call me tubs. Tub McThickums, that's right. Fuck! Oh God. Kinda miss those days. Still see you a little bit rocking it over there with it still. Excuse me. No, I mean you just, I mean, I'm just fucking with you. You don't have to get all... 'cause I'm fat? No, that's not... I'm just fucking with you. You're fine. It's all in the past. No worries. Shit. I gotta head out. Tori's throwing another party. - Yeah? - Yeah. You guys coming? Yeah, we'll think about it. Well, in that case, it's been fun while it has. See you, man. Been good to meet you too, man. - It's nice meeting you, bro. - See you, dog. Fuck that guy. Jesus! What an asshole. - Jesus Christ. - I hate that guy. Dude, he's so fucking bad at skating. That shit is not going in the movie, Dude, that shit he used to pull, like that shit sticks too. Like it was rough. Okay. You could kick his ass, dog. You can whoop him. Oh shit, it got dark. - Yeah. - Yeah, we'll find shit. How's the new camera? It's actually really good. Yeah, it's been good so far. Can I see it? Yeah, sure. Just be careful with it. Yeah, for sure. I was surprised by how good it was 'cause it's so old. I mean like we looked at some of the footage from it, but actually when we were looking at the bag, there was a USB in there with like a bunch of old footage of Hayden as like a seven-year old. No way! Wait, how do I see that? It's on my computer at home. I don't have it here, but yeah, it was cool. What was it called again? The little white snowflake. The fuck kinda name is that? Okay, it was a Christmas gift from my mom when we were like seven or some shit. She put it together. I don't know. Hey guys, I just had an idea. What if you show it to your mom? For what? Like, I don't know, it was just an idea. No, just like, what would that do? Well, like, I dunno, it might like show her that she still has another son to take over, to take care of, you know. Like Tucker is gone and that is the worst thing ever. But like I still have another son and a husband who need me and it's just not the same without me out. And, I don't know, maybe- No, yeah. I mean, that's a good idea. I mean, then I could edit it too so that a guy's music over it or something or we could like rearrange clip so it's cuter. I don't know anything about doing that. If you wanted to do that, that'd be awesome. - Yeah, I would. - Do your thing. Do you like wanna do that? Yeah, I mean, that sounds like a good idea to me. Okay. - Yeah, let's do it. - Okay, cool. All right. Let's do it. Yeah. It was a pretty good night. Yeah, it was. Hey, you know what? I think I'm gonna walk. I just wanna kinda like a breather. - Are you sure? - Yeah, man. - I'll be fine. - Okay. Hey, are you good? Yeah, I'm good. Just that, I wanna clear my head. - I love you, buddy. - I love you too, man. Stay safe, okay? You too, thanks. So, how's the movie? It's good. Does it still have no plot or? No, it's... What'd you call it? Like abstract or... Avant garde. Gotcha. Do you mind if I turn your music up? Yeah, for sure. Yup. Fuck. Are you gonna answer it? Donnie, you okay? Kyle, I fucked up, man. I'm so sorry. Hey, I don't really wanna go through this right now, but I'm not the person you should be apologizing to right now. Hayden won't answer my calls. Okay, sorry, I'm not with Hayden right now. And Chris? Yup. Say hi, Chris. Hey, Donnie. Could you tell Chris I need to hang out with him? Chris, Donnie really needs you to hang out with him. Well, I have a dentist appointment, so... I thought you had a dentist appointment tomorrow or yesterday. Wait, did he say he has an appointment? That's a lie, don't believe him. He said he couldn't hang out yesterday because he had some appointment. Okay, Chris. You don't have a dentist appointment. What's going on? Look, Donnie, to be honest, I don't really wanna hang out with you right now. I think we all just need a break from you, man. You made shit weird. - That's not fair. - Chris isn't being fair. Tell him he's not being fair. Hey, I'm not gonna fight all your fights for you, okay? Okay, but who breathes being everyone's older brother? Okay, I said that to you 'cause I feel like that. Not like I'm gonna solve all your fights for you. All I ask is that you fight for all our friendships then. You see where all this is going. I'm trying my hardest- - You're not trying shit. You know what, if you were really trying your hardest... Hey, watch the road, man. Watch the road. You would have come to the fucking skate park and apologized, okay? How was I supposed to know you were there? We're there every day. That's not even true. And what are you even thinking? I mean, you know how Hayden gets around water? I mean, what? Did you fucking forget about Tucker? It's always fucking Tucker. I hate to say it, I really do, but I'm tired of that shit. I was just trying to help him get over his fear of water or whatever, - like a good friend would. - No, no, no, no, no. A good friend doesn't push another friend into a fucking lake when they're afraid of water 'cause their fucking brother drowned in one. I mean, are you out of your goddamn mind? I mean, come on. Oh and usually, Tucker's an excuse- - Kyle, Kyle, watch the road, man. Look, if you wanna fix this, you're gonna find him on your own and you're gonna talk to them yourself. I'm not gonna be here forever, okay. Yo, eyes on the road. Eyes on the road. Are you kidding me? What, you can't look at me? - What now? - You can't even look at me? Look, Donnie... Hayden, just give me a chance explain myself. I'm driving myself fucking crazy right now. All right. What's up? All right. I really just wanted to help you. And how exactly was that gonna help? I don't know. I genuinely don't know, but I really was just trying. Listen, yo. I don't talk about him that much, Tucker, because it hurts. And I avoid water because I'm scared of it, and I know that's stupid, but- - No, no, no, no. That's not stupid at all. I don't know what I would do if I lost Teller. That's totally bad whatever you're feeling. Donnie, I wanna forgive you. It's just complicated, bro. And sometimes I just don't understand you. You don't understand me? Yeah, like the way you act around us, it's just like completely different when Teller's around, and I don't get that shit. All right. I'm scared too. I'm scared that if I act a certain way around you guys and a certain way around Teller, I'd lose Teller as a friend. Why do you think that? I don't know. It's just, it's been too long. Why did you push me, bro? Hayden, I don't know. No, Donnie, for real, why did you push me, yo? I really just wanted to help you. I thought maybe if I helped you in this way, then it would get you over your fear quicker. And I would be the one that helped you with that, you know. That was stupid. I know. I forgive you. What? I forgive you, Donnie. Look yo, you fucked up but you're still my best friend. So, I forgive you, I get it. Tucker's gone, and I know I can't do anything about that. I just wanna move on. I just wanna be okay. So what does that mean? I just wanna be good. I wanna swim. I wanna swim. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Let's swim. Let's do it. All right. So you're gonna get this to work or what? Yeah, sorry. I can. Is the DVD connected to the HDMI cable? What? Oh, there you go. The little white snowflake. Boom. Oh, how does Chris always win? He's probably cheating. Oh, he is so cheating. No, I'm not cheating. I'm not cheating. I'm just so skilled. That's not how that works. - It is how it works. - It's not a game of skill. It's a game of luck. I don't know what to tell you. I'm just so good. Talented shit. Yes, ma'am. Yes ma'am. These are always so good. Aren't they? I know. How do you make 'em? Well, I'll show you. It is... What? What? What? - It is. It's special. - Yo! - Hey, mom. - Yes. What? What? Are you kidding me? About? You're telling me it's been these store-bought cookies all this time? We thought it was some like family recipe. Chris and I have had long talks about this before. That's so awkward, I'm sorry. No, they've always been Betty Crocker. It's always the Betty Crocker. But they're good, right? They're good. They're good, huh? Where's Hayden? Shouldn't he be here? Oh yeah, he's actually doing something with his mom right now. What? He's showing her this project that we worked on together. Oh yeah, that's that thing you were talking about earlier, right? Yeah, yeah. Sick, nice. Well, I'll tell you what, when Chris is a famous director, he'll premiere it at our town theater. Yes. Hey guys, the car's all packed. You guys ready to go? Yeah. Yeah. Honey, listen. You be careful, okay? And you pick me up at the airport. Be careful, okay? Okay. All right, guys. Rock and roll. That was really cute, Hay. Thanks. Chris made it mostly anyways. Mom, you think you're ready to come out soon? Well, what? I think it's time. I'm about to leave for college. I reckon education. Okay, you guys ready? You guys ready? This is the grand premiere. Grand premiere. I worked really hard on this. - Right. - Okay. You were supposed to edit that out. Stamp your foot down, bend your knees. Do it. No, fuck y'all. I don't wanna do it anymore. - Bro, come on. - Okay, great. Does that mean I get a turn up there? No, shut up. - Oh, Donnie. - Oh, damn. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're good? I'm straight, I'm good. - Are you sure? - I'm good. Do you need a hand? Hey, your elbow. Is your elbow okay?
