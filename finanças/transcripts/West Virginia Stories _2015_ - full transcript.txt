Which makes me think there's some other not-so-nice people who will be wanting that money back. - Then that's all the more reason to go to the police. - Then what? - What do you mean, "then what?" - Then go to the police. Turn all this money in. And we're heroes for killing a couple of bad guys? What then? You think those people are going to be happy about losing that money? Huh?

No. And everybody, good and bad, is going to know just who the hell we are. - If we're in trouble, police won't use our names. - We're--we're in a town of 500 people, all right?

He's repaving the streets. Um... he won't even fix his truck. - You're giving him money for a truck? - Listen, I just... it's late. - For what? - Medical bills, okay? - What medical bills? - Bills that don't exist. Cancer. Lung cancer. He refuses to do anything about it, and it's driving me absolutely fucking insane. - Does he smoke? Is it from the mining? - Well, I think both. But he quit smoking. So we don't... but... My dad's dying. And he won't even try to fight it. And I don't really want to be around to watch it. - How long have you known about this? - I guess a little bit over a year. - That's why you've been avoiding me meeting him? - Hey, listen, he's going to be dead soon. I don't see a point in you two being best friends. - How soon? - A couple months. Maybe less. I didn't want to concern you with it. Why would I concern you with it? He was dying before we even met. - I could have been there for you, and... you should be spending time with him. - If he wanted to spend more time with me, he would try to fight it. Right? That's what my mom did. If he wanted to spend time with me, he would try to fight it. - You're being an asshole... - I didn't even know he was sick. The only reason I knew is because this town can't keep their mouths shut. He wants to up and die without telling anybody. And if he had his way, that's what would have happened. We wouldn't have even known about it. - Maybe that's what he wanted. - Well, if that's what he wants, then that's pretty fucking selfish to me. - Mitch.

It's their responsibility to maintain those at reasonable levels, so as not to contaminate the groundwater, or the drinking water, at any rate. But it ain't cheap to clean all that up. Much cheaper to pay someone off to falsify those reports, and then continue with business as usual. - Do you think they're doing that? - I don't know. I wouldn't put it past them.

What--what kind of car? - Black one. Here, I took some pictures. - Let me see. Whoa, that is cool. Super cool. Oh, that's very cool. It's crazy that somebody just left a car, a nice one like that, out there all alone. I bet somebody's going to come claim it, probably. - We should know soon. Mary's running the license plate. - Really? Hmm. What else did you do? - We fixed his truck. - Huh? - We fixed his truck. - Oh. I-- I forgot. I-- I got to--I got to go. I forgot, I got to do something. But I'm going to be out five, ten minutes. Anybody need anything? No? Okay. Here you go, sweetie. Thank you. I'll see you soon. - Thank you. - All right. Hey, I want to see that report when it's finished. - Okay. Bye, Joe. - The DEP called. - What'd they want? - Sending someone out to test the water tomorrow. - Huh! Guess the governor got on him, huh? - Never got through to the governor. - Well... whatever made them change their mind, I'll take it. You get through to the DMV about that car? - They had me on hold for over an hour. I'll call them tomorrow. Besides, been there all winter. One more day won't hurt. - Yeah. - Oh, Mitch stopped by. - When was that? - A couple hours ago. - Anything important? - Just to chitchat. I told him you were busy dealing with the water and the mine and whatnot. Get some sleep, Joe. - Hey, Dad. - Hey. Your mother see you? - Not yet. - Don't think she'd let you leave if she did. - How you been? - I'm good. Everything okay down by the camp? - I heard you found a car out in the woods. - Where you hear that? - Ryan. - And why would Ryan run down there and tell you that? - There's some things you need to know, Dad. ♪
