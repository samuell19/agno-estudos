My dear Nelly, in four days, you will marry our dear Vittorio. Say it in Italian. In Italian. She understands. It is with great emotion that I welcome the beauty, the intelligence and the youth, in our big family, that has always loved women as beautiful poetry, and lived the love as beautiful music. Long live the beautiful Nelly! Long live Vittorio! Long live love! Long live love. THE SAVAGE This is Radio Caracas, the voice of Venezuela. The other way! The other way! What? No, that way. I'm really sorry-- It's okay. Leave that. - I'll see you Wednesday. - We'll figure that out later. Here. Please. This is your room. That will be it. Thanks. That will be it! Hello? Please connect me to the 988792... I would like to speak with Mr. Fox, please. Hello? - Who is this? - Is this Nelly? Is that you, Karine? This is Nelly. - Everything good? - Well, in fact, no. Can I speak with Alex? What's that? - He's busy right now. - Well, go interrupt him. I need him! - Can he call you back? - No! - Why not? - I don't even know the number. I'm in a hotel, downtown. I've just left Vittorio. - When? - About half an hour ago. - So you're not getting married? - Of course I'm not! It's over! What happened? Hold on, I'll go get him. - Thanks. I'll wait. - Don't hang up. I'll wait. - Ah, Mr. Boratti. - Let's go! Let's go! You see, sir, when I saw her in that state, and at this hour, I thought, "Should I call him or not?" - Good, good. Where is she? - Room 324. Thank you. Sir, are you not taking the elevator? Nelly, it's me. Open up. Nelly, I know you're there. Open the door! What's with you? What did I do? You're not alone, is that it? - No! - Where is he? - Are you nuts? - Where is he? - What are you doing here? - I'm leaving! I'm sick of this! - Sick of what? - Of everything! Of you! - What about our wedding? - I don't want to get married! - You hear me? Leave me alone! - But you said yes! I was only scared, but I'm not scared anymore. You're not?! - I'll call the police! - The police? Not like that. - Take his legs. - Are you French? Yes. Come on. Up. All right, let's put him on the bed. - What's wrong with him? - What do you mean, what's wrong? "What's wrong with him?" Where are you going? - Who do you take me for? - Please, let me go. He's crazy. - He's going to kill me! - Nelly! Let me go! Help! It's okay. Just lie down. Lie down! Come on, you're covered in blood. What are you doing here? Where is she? - I'll explain-- - Where is she? All right, that's enough! Let me go. He's on his way! Wait! Stop the car! Nelly, stop the car! I don't want to stay here. I need to leave Venezuela. - Understand? - I understand. I don't walk around at night with millions in my pocket, darling. You know I wouldn't mind lending you the money. I'm not asking for a loan, Alex. I'm asking you to pay up. - How much? - What do you mean? You owe me $2,000. It's been a year. Didn't we say $400 a month? Exactly: September, October, November, and December counts double. Can't you count? Is it all I mean to you? Yes, that's all. - Thanks. - Turn around. - What? - Turn around. - I need that money, Alex. - Drop by tomorrow. - Not tomorrow, now! - I don't have that much! - See for yourself. - Put your hand in the till. So the cashier can see me? I can't. - She's my partner's wife. - I don't care! You know my partner. He's a Spaniard-- Alex, I want my money. Stop! It's here! Wait here! What work permit? I need it for my records. - I've never had one. - That's a problem, darling. You're a foreigner. I don't make the laws. That's enough. I'll call your wife. Give me that. Mr. Fox, there's a little problem. Could you come downstairs? - Don't you move. I'm on it. - What are you going to tell him? Don't you worry. - I'm certain. I'm certain she's here. - I've already told you she's not. Let go of me! Let go of me right now! - Don't you understand? - Let me through. Ah, Miguel. - Is this your car? - Yes. Bastard! Sorry, did I wake you? I wanted to ask. Do you like paintings? Because I have a good deal for you, but it's now or never. It's a Lautrec, as in Toulouse-Lautrec. Look, it says right here. Do you know how much it's worth? $50,000. At least. Do you know how much you can have it for? Say a number. $10,000. What? What's wrong? You think it's a fake? Okay, so what's this? - I don't know. - Its certificate of authenticity. If you don't have $10,000, I'll take $5,000. But I need it right now. Please. $5,000? I don't have that kind of money. - How much do you have? - I don't know. Look in the... - Why are you asking me? - Because you're my only friend. I can't explain now, but I have to catch a plane and I don't have any money. - Is that all you have? - Yes. - That's not enough. - If it's not enough, go beg in the room next-door, 'cause I'm getting up at 7:00 and I have to get some sleep. Otherwise-- - What's going on? - It's 7:00! No way. It is. - You're still here? - Of course I'm still here. So tell me, where do you intend to fly to? - France. - France? - That's a long flight. - That's why it's expensive. Okay, what I could do is drop you off at the airport. It's on my way. I know someone there. Well, he's a friend of mine. Can I borrow money from him? Money, certainly not. Not, but he might-- we'll see. Why don't you call in for coffee? No, let's go now. We'll have coffee over there. - What if there's no flight for France? - There's one every Tuesday. What are you doing in Venezuela? Truck farming. I'm into fruit and vegetable. You came all the way here to garden? Exactly. Where I used to live, the land wasn't great. - Hey, wait! - You again? What am I supposed to do? They're right here! - Step on it! Step on it! - I'm already stepping on it! - Nelly, stop. - Go faster! - Don't mind him. Keep driving. - Yeah, yeah, yeah... Get out of this car! You've done enough! - Who the hell is that? - Don't mind him either. - He's my old boss. - What does he want? I'm not sure. His painting, maybe. - Is that painting his? - Well... Just give it back. I can't drive around for weeks! I'll never give it back! He owes me a year's salary! And I'm not telling you everything-- the bastard! Look out! - Be careful! You're driving like a-- - That's enough! I give up. - Certainly not! - Will you stop?! - Stop the car! - What's wrong with you? Are you nuts? Look at that. They-- No, it looks fine. No, they did! They scraped it! That's the thing to do. I just bought it. - Whose is it? - It's mine. Here. - Grab this. - So you do the cooking? - I do. - Does it work on gas? Of course. Give me the end of the rope. With electric plates, you can't control the heat. They take hours to cool down. With gas, you can turn the heat up or down. - You can control it better. - Right. - So, can we go now? - Get in. I'll be a minute. I couldn't find any more excuses, so I said, "Okay, let's get married." I thought that would calm him down, but it became worse. - Towards the end, he beat me up. - Really? Well, I beat him up too. In the end, it was better with Alex, but with Alex, you're just another girl. And I can't take that. Alex is... the painting owner, right? - That's right. - Because I'm a little... He dragged me all the way here. I lived in London when we met. I owned some sort of club with a friend of mine. And what are you going to do in France? I have no idea. My dad might help me. So you never married? Never. What am I saying? Yes, did! Seven or eight years ago. I think. - What happened to the guy? - What guy? Your husband! Here he is. Wait for me. - Come this way. - So what did he say? It's all good. Passport? I'm saying she's here in the office, she arrived late. Call the Commander immediately. I'll take care of the ticket... - How am I going to pay? - You can pay later, in France. - How come? - I asked him. But you'd better pay him, Because I'm his guarantee. - We don't even know each other. - Shush! She's a passenger on flight 124. She's late. The plane has been notified. Goodbye. Have a good flight. Thanks so much. I'm leaving now, but I'll write to you. Let's go. - What's your address, by the way? - Write to the hotel. - Where is she? - She's gone. - Where to? - Paris. Could you move your car? Don't touch it! - Why is she going to Paris? - Why should I know? Ask her! She's in the plane over there. Wait up! Wait up! She's done for. I need to make a long-distance call. When do you think you'll get me a new battery? - By the end of the month. - Very good. - Hey, how about the bill? - Next time. Don't worry about it. Here, Vittorio. Eat. No, Mom. I can't. You can eat it even if you're not hungry. Come on, Vittorio. Drink something, at least. Hello, Miss. What?! She's asking me to pay for the call. With all they owe me already. Yes, okay. Put him on. Hello, Claudio. Yeah, everything's great. Wonderful. So? What?! But it can't be-- You didn't go-- Yes, yes. 124 Asa Road, yes. Right. Right. - She wasn't on the plane. - Oh, God. How are you? Remember me? What are you doing here? I thought you'd left. I couldn't. They tried to steal my painting as I was boarding the plane. They tried to what? - Who? - The customs. You can look at the signature. It's a copy. A friend of mine gave it to me and it's got emotional value. Look. I've only got one bag. That's the only thing I wanted to bring back with me. It's not cool of you. Of course, if you'd been there, you might have been able to-- When your friend told me you lived on an island, I was ready to swim there! Then he showed me where it was. What are you talking about? How did you pay him? - I gave him my plane ticket. - Your ticket for France? That's all I had. He was quite happy. - What do you want? - What was that? What do you want from me? I've just got in, I'm exhausted, I have a ton of work, and you're still here - with your crazy stories... - What stories? That's enough! I don't have time for this. I didn't spend two days at sea to come back to this! All you do is talk about you, you, you! You're not the center of the world! I know you're tired, and all I see you do is sleep! So when you're up, let me know and we'll talk. There's nothing to talk-- where are you going? I have a deal for you. This time, you're going to like it. Really? Would you mind taking me to Santo Domingo? - Santo Domingo? - On your boat. I know a guy there. Why did I not think of that? His wife lives for paintings. So I'm sure they'll buy my painting for a good price. - And with the money-- - Hold on, hold on. Do you know where Santo Domingo is? - North. - Indeed. And going north takes about a week! And this boat ain't no Chris-Craft, so I'm not-- I'm not asking for a favor. I'll pay for everything-- gasoline, the boat trip, the plane ticket. We'll be even. Then I'll be fine and you won't have to worry about me. So? Wait. Just give me your price. We can share the money. I mean-- one-third, two-thirds. Do you want me to go? How? I don't know. Are there not any boats, fishermen here? No. - Never? - No. Hold on. Put it down. It's not right. No, over here. Just push it in. A bit more. Good. Are you coming or what? Why do all the work? - There's a tractor right there. - It doesn't work. What's in there? Compost for my plot. What the-- what the-- Look at this. They messed everything up. - Who? - The animals-- - iguanas. - Are there many of them? - Did you plant everything here? - Yes, I did. - How much do you sell them for? - What? Your fruit and vegetable. All you talk about is money. Why don't you pick a couple of tomatoes? Isn't there anyone else on the island? No. Are these really tomatoes? - I've never seen any like these before! - Isn't that sad? Wait. Tomorrow, I could make you baked squash and zucchini. Is this house yours? - No, I'm renting it. - How much? Sorry. - Have you been here long? - Almost two years. I've signed a 99-year lease. Then I'll see. I'll keep you posted. Where did you use to live? In France? In France and other places. I've been-- - Around. - Exactly. - It's not good? - It's a little sharp. What? I made it myself. - What with? - Grapes. I found some vines in the back. I made six gallons of wine this year. It's not sharp at all. How are you doing, buddy? Let me look. Don't move. - Are you done? - Almost. I'm spent. Aren't you tired? - Get up, we're leaving. - Where to? - Hurry, the tide's going out. - What, now? - But you never mentioned that. - Wear something warm. - It gets cold at night on the boat. - But-- I'll be right out! You know what we'll do when we get to Santo Domingo? We'll have the best meal. On me! Listen, I can't take you to Santo Domingo. - So what are we doing? - I'm taking you back. - Where to? - To where you came from. Are you out of your mind? I didn't come this far to finally go back! And I didn't come this far to go to Santo Domingo! I don't do tourist rides. - Then I'm staying! - What, here? Yes, here. We're happy here. I'm happy here, and I'm happy because I'm by myself. Get it? So get on the boat, because you're wasting my time. Please let me stay. I have nowhere to go. - Come with me. - Why? Because. Come. Let me go! Bastard! No wonder you're all by yourself! Bastard! I want out of this shitty boat! Let me out! Open up! Open up! I want out! That's enough! Open up! What the-- Are you nuts? I want to know. Let me know. Fine. Fine, it's very simple. I'm reporting you. Reporting who? Reporting who? If she wasn't on the plane, why don't you report that? - Why are you bothering us with that? - "Bothering you", is that what you said? - What are you doing? - What is this about? Where is this woman? - Who is she? - What do you mean, who is she? You know who she is. You gave her tickets. - How did she pay? With what money? - Do you have the manifest... The flight to Paris. I saw it take off. Don't tell me you don't know. - Economy or first class? - We don't have the manifest. You'll have to go to the travel agency on Oganeta Avenue. And not today because they're repairing the plumbing. What the hell do I care about the plumbing? I'm calling the police. All right, sir. That's enough. I've told you that we don't know who this person is. So please leave right now. We are very busy here. Tonight you'll all be arrested! I'm going to complain to the Ministry of Communications! I'm hurt! - Where were you? - Something terrible happened. Hi. This is Ribeiro, from the airport. I'm busy right now. Call back at 1:15. No, I have to talk to you right now. A couple of days ago, he came by with a girl who needed a plane ticket. And now two guys were here and destroyed our office. I don't understand anything. He said the girl... - I'm completely lost. - Hold on, hold on. The girl? What girl? You had to call me right away. That's what I'm paying you for, right? Who is that girl? I asked him many times if there was a girl, he'd always tell me no. And now, all of a sudden, there is a girl. Get out of there! Do you hear me? Get out! Try that again, and I'll smash your head in! What are you doing here? "Martin Sanders. General delivery. La Guaira, Venezuela." FRENCH PERFUME GETS AN AWARD Damn it! You're gonna get it! Damn it! Look at that! Enough of this, okay? If you're hungry, let's eat! But don't steal. Just ask! All right, that's enough. Come back. Santo Domingo... I'll give you goddamn Santo Domingo. Open up! Open up! Open the door! Are you insane?! Give it a rest or I'll bust your stove. I can make noise too. By the way, who's the brunette on the picture? Your wife? How old is she? Tell me if I'm wrong. 46? 47? Oh, so you're in perfumes? I thought you were a gardener. So where's your store? Do you make a lot of money? Mademoiselle.. You'll be okay. What time is it? So where is it? - What? - Grasse. Above Cannes, in the hills. How come you did not know? I just didn't. The whole area is dedicated to perfume. When I was a kid, my brother and l were trainees at the distillery. We'd go pick violets every day. That did not sound too hard. Except we had to get up at 4:00 a.m. because they had to be picked before sunrise. And if there are no more violets? Then chemistry comes in. - For example, Solo-- - What's "Solo"? "Solo," as in solo. I came up with it 15 years ago. Never heard of it? How about College and Variance? - What's so funny? - I don't know. Your job. It's part of a big industry, you know? Didn't "College" come in an ink bottle? - It did. - I used to wear it in Spain. - What did you think of it? - It was expensive! That's not my department. I mean, it has nothing to do with me. What do you mean? I read in that article that you were a genius. What's the name of your company in New York? It was not my company. It was not my job. The brunette in your drawer, she was your wife? Is she American? - Oh, I see. - What do you see? She dragged you to the States. I don't know. I'm just saying. Did she love you? Thanks. "Sanders" is not your name. No, I changed it. When you start a new life, you do not want to be found? You take a new name. Did you love her? Are you working for the police, or what? All this didn't happen because of a woman. So what happened? What happened... I don't know. Everything was very-- I had good ideas for which I got paid. A lot? I'm the one who ended up paying a lot. Too much. So you just left, suddenly? What did you tell people? Nothing. To anyone? Are you crazy? What are you doing? It's for my raft. - I'm taking you to Santo Domingo. - On a raft? By "Santo Domingo," I mean-- this one won't do. - We'll get to the coast and then-- - What coast? The coast of Guaira is the closest, though it's already far. We might have to finish the trip using the sail. No kidding. From there, all you'll have to do is jump on a plane. Really? What will you do? I'll try to buy a new boat. Unless we can lift the old one up. - So we won't see each other again? - No, we won't. Well, you never know in life. Thankfully. There's coffee in the kitchen. Want some? You know what we'll do? You'll go to La Guaira and I'll wait for you here. You'll come back with a new boat. Then we'll both go to Santo Domingo. No. I want to stay with you. No. - You bastard. - What do you mean? Where is she going? Where are you going? Nelly! How's Paulie? Fine. Thanks. I wanted her to join me, but you know how she's scared of flying. - How are the kids? - You mean, the grandkids? They're in Geneva with their parents. - You know, we own them now. - Yes, I know. Coleman told me. - Still not suspecting anything? - No. - Are you sure? - Of course. We even bought out his island without his approval. So who does he pay rent to? To the old owners. Miss Mark made the arrangements. She's wonderful, you know? Don't you ever want to get him back? Surely not! He'd go even farther away, and that would cost us even more money. Are you sure he'll be back? What's he doing here? He's selling his fruits and vegetables. - To whom? - To us. I mean, he sells them at the market, and once he's left, Miss Mark steps in. What's the problem? Don't you agree? I don't. He's costing us money? So what? He's helped us make 100 times more and it's not over! He's irreplaceable! But you won't make him come back by buying him half the Atlantic! So go there with a gun, my dear. I don't need a gun, Mr. Delouis. I can just pick up the phone and call our lawyers. Do you know what this is? The 27 contracts he signed before disappearing. 27 lawsuits! Who will pay for those? You? The Japanese built four factories to make perfume that is still in Mr. Coutances' head. - Who will pay for those? You? - Well, I don't speak Japanese. You just don't know how much money we've lost over the past 18 months. I can tell you. $6,776,000 lost. - What about me? Wait up! - I'm not leaving. I'm just testing it. You are? So it's not finished yet? No, it took longer, Because I had the flu. - You had the flu? - Last week. But I'm better now. Here. Catch this. I dropped by on Wednesday. You were not at home. - What time? - Around 4:00 or 5:00. I went fishing at low tide. - Did you find the bottle? - What bottle? The Nuit Saint Georges. I left it on the table. Oh yeah. Thank you. So when are we going? - I don't know. Whenever. - Why not now? I'll get my stuff. - Wait. We can't just-- - What? I mean, we're in no hurry. Let's relax a bit. All right. Let's say tomorrow, then. - If you'd like. - 7:45? - Why 7:45? - Let's say 8:00 then. Great. See you then. Hold up. Don't you want to come up for a-- No, thanks. Who is it? - It's me! - Who, "me"? What do you mean, "Who, me"? It's me, Martin. What's this phone? The one they used to have. I made a new connection. If you'd done it earlier, we could have called for help. It only works between the two houses. Could you call me later? I can't talk right now. Or I'll call you back. What's your number? There are no numbers. It's mechanical. I wanted to tell you-- Fucking phone! Hello?! That's better. I wanted to ask you over for dinner. - When? - Tonight. It's your last night. I can't tonight. I have a lot to do. But thanks anyway. Let's talk soon. What am I saying? - Come on. We'll never see each other again. - What time? - Is 9:00 ok? - All right. - 9:00 it is. Please be on time, and I'm sorry to say this, but I'm cooking-- Hello? Hello? It's dead. Oh, my little darlings! - What's wrong? - Nothing. Why? What do you mean, why? Are you ill? No. Are you? - Are you taking me for a fool? - Exactly. I should throw a fit, but for some reason, I don't feel like it. Now it's raining. Well done! We're gonna get drenched. - Are we? - That's enough. Let's go and have dinner? And then we'd sleep together to celebrate my departure? - What's wrong? - What's wrong with you? What do you mean? I've prepared-- - I'm getting tired of this! - You're getting tired? - I've been tired of this since day one! - What? You never notice anything. You'd better get new glasses! Because it's too late now. - What's too late? - You should have done this earlier. - There's no point now! - What do you want, a declaration of love? - I would have loved that! - So I'll do it now! Too late! I don't care anymore! No, you're coming with me! Martin! - I just saw someone! - Who? Where? I don't know. A man, right there. Catch him! Catch him! Right here, quick! We've got him! Where is she? Where's Nelly? - Where is she? - In a shack. - Come on, get ready. - Where's Martin? Hurry! We're waiting for you. Martin took off to the mountains. What are you looking at? Tell the others we're coming. We are done here. It took me a while. I looked for you everywhere. I even called your father in France. That old bastard hung up on me. And then I placed an ad, offering a 10,000 Bolivar reward. - Smart, wasn't it? - Nobody knew I was here. The pilot did. He came to collect the money. - Which pilot? - The one who flew you here. So what's up, darling? You look good. Guys, do you have a cigarette? Get him! Get him! Run! Run! - Where's the painting? - In the back. Let's go. Watch your step. What did you do to the painting? - Leave her alone. - It's damaged. Look at it. What happened? - It fell in the water. - What do you mean? - Where? - In the ocean. - Leave her alone! - I won't! Look at the girl's eye. Here and here. Look at the nose! She's unrecognizable. She's not. You've never cared for art. Why would you now? I'll sue her! That's enough! You're breaking our balls with your fucking painting! This way. - Look, it's Vittorio. - Where are the others? - They're coming. Let's go, quickly. - Let's go. - Go onboard. Be careful. No, leave her. She will manage. Vittorio! Hey, my friend! I can't believe it! I'll be right there. I'm so glad to see you! How are you? - How's Nelly? - What do you mean? - Is she not with you? - No. I was told she dropped by here a couple of months ago, so I thought she went to look for you. - Didn't she? - She didn't. Because you know, we got married, but it didn't work out. It just didn't. And I'm not blaming her. We're no angels either. - Vittorio! - I'm coming, honey! Isn't she beautiful? She's got a mean streak, but... I might remarry. So whoever sees Nelly first, sends the other's regards, ok. But don't you know... where she could be? I think she spent some time in Mexico. You know how she is. Haven't heard from her since. Ciao, my friend! Come by for dinner sometime! Ciao! - Mr. Coutances? - Yes. Excuse me, but I think-- - Are you Mr. Sanders-Coutances? - I am. A lady left it for you, four or five months ago. THE SAVAGE
