Let's not jump to conclusions. He might be in the recreation ward. I sure as hell hope so. It's more likely to lose our boy in the halls. Sometimes for hours. Miss Collins? Yeah? We were wondering if you know- - William Grayham missed our appointment this morning. Do you know where we can find him? I haven't the faintest idea. I'm on my coffee break. Thanks. See what happens when you cut staff? - Well, it doesn't look like he's in here. No. I'll alert security. Why don't you talk to these people? Maybe they know where he is. - Yeah, listen, don't forget to check the bathrooms. Last week, we found one guy trying to take bath in the toilet. Have you seen William Grayham? - Ain't gonna get much off of this bunch. What about you? Locked. Would you go down to Dr. Brookheart, please, and get the key? Right away. Anybody in there? You in there, Grayham? What the hell are you doing here? Come on. Come on. - Hey, where do you think you're goin'?! I told you to sit in the fuckin' corner! Mark? Who is it? - You gonna come to the ice cream parlor after registration? - Nah, me and Doreen, here, we're gonna party hard. Is that all you's two can do? - Hey, what else do you go to college for? Hey, Johnny boy. Heard you had to take Sociology again. My stupid teacher got killed. What a pain in the ass. Hey, don't I know it? I wonder what this new teacher's gonna be like. Betcha she's gonna be a real pip. Excuse me. Can you tell me where Father Jensen's office is? I can't seem to find it. You're in the wrong hallway. You go down here and make a left and then it's the third office on your left. Okay, thank you. Hmm. Come in. Please, sit down. Margaret, we'll have to cancel the meeting for today. Reschedule it tomorrow at two o'clock. Yeah, two. How are you today, Miss Parker? Oh fine, thank you. Father Janson, I was wondering if you- - Yeah, Margaret, if she can't make it, you'll have to tell her to see Father Perkins personally. He'll straighten it out. Yes. Look, I can't talk right now, I have an appointment. I'll call you back later. Right, goodbye. I'll just be a minute. Okay. Let's see. You graduated Cum Laude. Transferred once, transferred three times. Well, I switched my major and decided to finish my undergraduate at NYU. - Is this your first teaching position? Mhmm. Nervous? A bit. - Well, after reviewing your application, I find that you have all the qualifications for the position and I'd like to welcome you to our staff. Oh, that's great. Thank you. - I'm sure you're going to find this position both challenging and rewarding for your career. Any questions? No, none at the moment. Okay. Maybe you could spend the rest of the day just sort of familiarizing yourself with the university. Oh, okay. Busy. Just a minute, Miss Parker. There's one more thing I think I should tell you about. You'll find out anyway, so I may as well tell you now. What is it? - You're not superstitious, are you? - Superstitious, no, of course not. - Well, apparently, several of the other applicants for the position were. They pulled out of the job at the last minute. Really? Why? - Well, there's a silly rumor going around, probably started by the students, that the classroom you'll be using is jinxed. Jinxed? Oh, that's silly. - I trust you heard of the tragedy last semester. No. Mmm, I thought not. Well, a young teacher, Janet Phillips, was attacked in the class you'll be using. It happened late one night and we're not sure how or why it happened. - Well, did they find out who did it? - No, unfortunately, her death remains a mystery. Death? You mean she was murdered? Yes. Now, we're certain that her death was an isolated incident and no one connected with the university was involved in any way. I hope this hasn't influenced your decision about accepting the position. No. Just a minute. Who is it? Who's there? Miss Parker? Oh, Mrs. Bloom. I didn't know who it was. Come on in. - I guess you didn't hear me knocking. Is everything all right? - Yeah, would you like some coffee? I'm sure there's still some hot on the stove. - Oh, no thanks, I can only stay for a minute. I just wanted to come to remind you to make sure that you lock the front entrance door when you come in at night. Some of the other tenants have been complaining it's being left open and you know, I really don't blame them with all the kooks running around killing people they don't even know. You know it seems to me if you're gonna kill someone you at least know them real well. You know, that's very strange. There was a woman killed in the school I'm teaching at. It happened a few months ago. Do you know anything about it? Yes. I saw pictures of her body in the newspapers. Blood all over the place. It was awful. Oh, I don't even wanna talk about it. Now, you take when Mrs. Crawley decided to do away with her husband. Mrs. Crawley, who's she? - Oh, she lived here a little over a year ago. Now, all she had to do was put some arsenic into Mr. Crawley's prune juice. Went just like that. Didn't feel a thing. That's a much nicer way, don't you think? Yeah. - Of course, it did take me a whole week to air the place out. - Is there anything else, Mrs. Bloom? - Oh, I guess you wanna finish your unpacking. I'll stop by later and we'll chat. Yeah, okay. Have a nice day now, ya hear? Bye bye, Mrs. Bloom. I got the beers. - About time, where the hell were you? I'm gonna get something to eat. You want something? - Yeah, can I have a Coke, please? Cut it out, Goddammit. You never howl at me like that. - I really shouldn't be drinking this, I'm on a diet. - Cut the shit, we all know you're an alky. Have some beer. I don't want any, thanks. You need a shave. That's why they call me Wolf. Thanks. Hey, how's it goin'? - Forget it, Jim, she's already got somebody. Yeah, who? Tom Scavelli from Pace. Tom Scavelli? You mean that asshole who knocked up Sue Ann McCarthy? Sue Ann McCarthy? Whoo. I remember her. No, that was Tommy Seville. How do you know? I was there. - You didn't tell me you went out with her. It was a year ago, Donna. Give me a break. You wanna know my whole life story? There's a lot of things I don't tell you. - Yeah, what else haven't you told me? - Here you go again, bustin' my chops. We can't go through one day without you havin' to start a fight? Me? You started it. Kiss my left cheek, Donna. I would if you'd shave it. Oh, gross. Goddammit. Buh bye. Cathy! You're an asshole. Christ, chick's on the rag, man. What's the matter, Cath? What's wrong? Ah, don't worry about him. He's just drunk. Nah, it's not him. It's something else. What? - I haven't had my period in over a month. Has that ever happened to you? Yeah, once. Thank God it wasn't what I thought. - I guess I should see a doctor about it, but I'm not sure if I wanna go. - Well, well don't worry about it 'til you're sure. - I guess I just wanna talk to someone. - I wouldn't fuck you with John's dick. - I bet you like a little foo foo, Jimmy baby. - Yeah, why don't you kiss my ass? Fuck you. Hey, where we goin'? We're gonna go to Tony's house and see if we can cop some shit off of him. No, thanks. I'm going. Hey Cathy, where you going? Back to the dorm. Okay, see ya later. Bye bye. That chick is definitely on the rag. Let's get the fuck outta here. Let's move it. - So, what are you sellin' this shit for? Six bucks for a nickel bag. What? - Yeah, if it's a nickel bag, why you charging six bucks? Inflation. - That's the last time I'm buyin' any shit from any business major. - Hey you's guys, how come you's are always hangin' out at the stairs? Ah. - So, are you's guys gonna come to the party tonight? - I wish I could, but Doreen's being a real pain in my ass and has to go home to do homework. Go to hell. "Go to hell." - Well, you know, Tony, I'm always free tonight. Yeah, she won't make you pay. - See if you can clear this up with the front office, okay? - All right, I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Are you free this evening? There's something I wanted to talk over with you. I'm tied up this evening. I wish you'd give me a little more advance notice if you want me to stay late. - Well, that's why I'm telling you now. # Run away, run away, run away, run away # Run away, run away # She's a fugitive kind # She's a fugitive kind # She's a fugitive kind # She's a fugitive kind It's Parker. Teacher. I thought she was some chick. Good morning. This is Intro to Sociology. I hope you're all in the right class. Okay, why don't I have you start by passing your class cards up front? Did anyone bring them? Okay. Well, then why don't you just bring them tomorrow? Oh, the requirements. The requirements for this course will be to show up occasionally, a final and a term paper. I'll try and be very lenient with your topics on your term paper as long as they somehow relate to the course. Father Perkins. Did you want to see me? - No, I think I'll sit in the back and observe. - Oh, would you like me to review what we were just talk- - No, don't pay any attention to me. Pretend I'm not here. Oh, okay, Well, as I was saying, what I'd like to do each week is to discuss current issues aside from the required reading so that we can hopefully tie the two together. Is there someone, all right, is there someone who would like to suggest something they feel strongly about? Is there someone who'd like to suggest something they don't feel strongly about? Yes. Hmm? Did you want to say something? About what? There must be something going on that you feel strongly about. I don't... What about the new bill to make abortion illegal again? Yeah, that's good. Well, that brings up the debate about the separation of church and state. Of course, this is a very controversial issue with many sides to the argument. Take it easy. This class eats shit. - If you think she's bad, you should've seen the one before. John, what's wrong with you? You shoulda never woken me up. What'd I do to her? Oh, thank you. Cathy. Bye. Just a minute, Miss Parker. Miss Parker. Yes? - I'd like you stop by Father Jensen's office this afternoon, please. Did I do something wrong? We'll discuss it later. # Run away, run away, run away, run away # Run away - I spoke with Father Perkins about what happened this afternoon and I am afraid I have to agree with him. - Well, I don't see what you're objecting to, Father. All I tried to do was to give the students an opportunity to discuss current issues aside from the required reading so that I could somehow tie it in with the material you gave me to teach with. - What you apparently don't understand Miss Parker, is that our curriculum has been carefully developed and tested over a period of years and found successful. - Well, there is room for improvement in any system. Granted. Now, I'm personally not adverse to the introduction of new materials or methods, but you'll have to discuss them with me first. Do we understand each other? Yes. - Are you having any disciplinary problems with some of your students? No, not really. It's too early to tell. - Well, if you do, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know. There are several whose conduct I find highly objectionable. Really? What did they do? Never mind. Look, Miss Parker, I don't want you to feel that you've been singled out because you're new here. Obviously, I wasn't present during the incident, so... Perhaps I've been too harsh on you. Now, if you're having any problems or misunderstandings with anyone, please just stop and see me. That's what I'm here for. Father, I didn't mean to stare. - It's nothing to be concerned about, my dear. It's just a muscle spasm. Have a good evening, Miss Parker. Goodnight, Father. It was great for a while, then it got to be a real hassle money-wise, so I had to take the first thing that was open. Here I am. How did you end up here, Cindy? About the same, except I started right after graduate school. I mean, it seemed like a good deal at first. The money wasn't bad. Now it's a dead end. Soon as something better opens up, I'm getting out. Well, keep your fingers crossed and maybe somebody'll die somewhere. - Right, I'll check the obituaries in tonight's paper. So, how did it go today? Don't ask. Perkins came in to observe. - Don't about it, it's your first day. Yeah, I know. Sure got off to a hell of a start. Oh, gross. What's the matter? There's a fingernail in my pie. Look, I'm gonna get my money back. Want anything while I'm there? No, thanks. Oh, Tony. Babe. Oh, Tony. Tony. Oh, Tony. Oh, Tony. Tony! What, what, what? I can't go through with this. What if Doreen comes back? She's not comin' back. She's got a class now. Are you sure? - I'm supposed to be in that class. All right. Tony. What now? - I have to know, do you have a thing? 'Course I got a thing. What do you think I am, a eunuch? I don't mean that thing. I mean a thing. - You mean like, a rubber band or a prophylactilator? Mhmm. - I had it on an hour ago when I waitin' to come here. All right. Oh Tony. Tony. Oh, Tony, Tony. No, Tony, Tony, I can't. What's the matter with you? Why not? - I have a feeling Doreen's gonna come. I swear to you. She's not coming. She's gonna be in class 'til six o'clock. Tony, what are you doing here? Homework. - What happened to you in class? - Oh man, that Parker bores me to tears. She's a stiff. And besides, I figured I had to surprise you here. Some surprise. - So, what do you girls wanna do tonight? - I thought we were supposed to study for the exams. Why study when I got the answers written right on the back of my wrist? - Yeah well, that doesn't help me any. - Hey, it's multiple choice. What's that? Hey guys. Let's party. Hey guys. Oh, shit. What the hell you doing? Who else the fuck is out there? Jesus Christ. Get With it. Good night, Julie. See you tomorrow. Oh, hello. I'm a little late. - That's quite all right, come in, come in. # Found the door and I got out # You didn't tell your mother # You didn't tell your friends # You didn't try to phone me # To get back in # You don't like that Hi. What's up, Tony, how you doin'? - Hey, how's it doin', four eyes? - Hey, what happened to you's guys? Genius, here, lost his license. Yeah? How'd you do that? - Hey man, some asshole judge took it away. I only had 37 tickets. - So how'd you's manage to get in here? I drove my mom's car. - Hey, Johnny boy, is that homework I see you doin'? Don't be an idiot! I'm makin' copies of the sociology midterm I took. Really? Lemme get one. - No way, I'm selling 'em for 10 bucks. Not givin' them away. What do you think I am, a communist? You cheap bastard. After all the dope I sold you? You ingrate. Yo, beer tender. - You kids got our IDs? Oh, tough guy. There you go. - You got an older brother? No, I'm adopted. Now let's get some beer action over here. Ooh, thanks a lot. # You don't like me # You don't like me at all - Hey Denise, you hear about Wolf and Donna? No, tell me, what happened? They broke up last night. Ooh, what happened? He pissed on her? Shut up. What about that new girl, Cathy? She still goin' outwith that Tom Scavelli? - Forget it, Jimbo, she's not for you. Yeah, she's a human being. Hey Jimbo, I got a couple bag ladies just love to go out with you. Yeah, kiss my ass. - Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you? - Doreen, you gonna go to the drive-in tonight? No, I gotta do my term paper. - Hey, I thought we were goin' out tonight. - I told ya I couldn't stay out late. You're a pain in my ass, Doreen. Look, I'm not gonna flunk out just to see some dumb movie. - Hey, who says we have to see a movie? I'm not in the mood. Hey Tony, I'll go outwith ya if you promise to be gentle. You guys are Pigs- I better get going. - You're bein' a real pain in my ass, you know that. Wolf was right about you. Go to hell. You go to hell! # You don't like me # You don't like me at all - Tony, you're being such a real asshole tonight, you know that? Why? What did I say? - Hey, your girlfriend's walking out on ya. Don't let her get away with that. Hey, I gotta finish my beer. Oh, shit. Come on, start. - That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Ain't shittin' you, man. They do it in their office all the time. I just seen 'em going in the other day. Hey John, did you hear that? What? - Jimbo says that Father Williams and Margaret are bumping away every night in his office. Who gives a shit? Let's get out of here. Hey, where we gonna go? - I'll get a couple six pack, we'll go over to the drive-in. Where the hell did Doreen go? Hey you guys, got the beers. Hey, give me one. Hey, give her a beer. Yo, Fuzzy, this beer sucks. You bought ginger ale. Don't you check the bag? Such a pig! You're an asshole. I'm sorry. Come in. Who is it? Looking for me? - Mark, just a minute, I have to lock up first. - You better hurry or we'll be late for dinner. - And what makes you think I'll go to dinner with you? Are you hungry Yeah, a bit. - Well that's a step in the right direction. Mark, can I ask you a question? Well sure. Do you know what happened to the woman who died last semester? You mean you really don't know? - No, nobody will talk to me about it. - Well that's because everyone feels it was someone on campus who did it. Who? - Could be someone who wasn't even aware he was doing it. Or she? That's right, or she. Did you know her? Janet Phillips? Mark? Not really. Miss Parker? Oh yes, Mrs. Bloom? I have some mail for you. Oh, okay. They left it to me by mistake. Wait a minute and I'll get it. Here it is. Oh, is all this stuff for me? It's addressed to you, isn't it? - Yeah but I never ordered any of it. I guess the school must've sent it over. Great, I'm probably on some idiot list now. I know what you mean. When Mr. Bloom died, Happy Valley Cemetery sent me all kinds of junk mail. Lists and prices of cemetery lots. Certainly not ready to move in there yet. Is that all, Mrs. Bloom? - Did you remember to lock the front entrance door? Yes, Mrs. Bloom. - Can never be too careful these days, you know. Goodnight, Mrs. Bloom. "Miracles of Christ." Hey, John! Do you have my term paper for me? I got the 15 bucks. Were those due today? - Yeah, don't tell me you forgot it. What's your name? Joy. - I knew there was something I had to do last night. Great, now I gotta cut class. Don't worry, I have an idea. What? Hi, Cathy. - Hi. I just wanted to tell you I won't be in class today. Oh really, why not? Well, something's come up. I have to go to the doctor. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. Are you coming tomorrow? I'm not sure yet. - Well, look, you take care of yourself, okay? Okay. Bye. Okay. What's I'd like to do today is to go over the term projects for those of you who might be having trouble with it. So if you'd just take out your topics, we can talk about how you're gonna approach them. - You didn't say they were due today. - Well, I'm sure I mentioned never times last week. - You said they were due at the end of the month. - Does anyone have their topics prepared? - I can't believe you got away with it. I told you it would work. - What's the teacher gonna do when she finds out? She'll cut class. - You know, the strangest thing happened to me in one of my classes today. I had the feeling they conspired against me. Has that ever happened to you? Not recently, Julie. Come on, I'm serious. I wasn't imagining it. - You know, I think that you've had a bad day. I think mine's been pretty shitty too. You wanna go do something? It'll make you feel better. Well, I might be busy tonight. Oh. Julie, it's none of my business but are you seeing Mark Hammond? Yeah, sort of, why? Just wondering. Oh boy. Professor Parker? Professor Parker? Oh, hi Cathy, you startled me. Did you go to the doctor today? Yeah. Well how're you feeling? - Not so good, that's why I wanted to talk to you. Well, sure, go ahead. Well, I mean privately. You're not gonna tell anybody, are you? No, of course not. Look, did you talk to Father Janson? Are you kidding? He'd throw me out of school. What about Tom? I'm afraid to. - You're gonna have tell him sooner or later. Don't you think it's something you both should discuss? I guess so but I'm just afraid he's not gonna speak to me again. It's mostly my fault. Now that's not true, Cathy. He is just as responsible as you are. What if my mother found out? She's so old fashioned. She'd make me get married or something. - Look, Cath, I can't make up your mind for you. But I do know some place you can go if it's a question of money. Come on. Hello? - Can I speak to Cathy, please? Hi. Can you turn that down? Look, I have to talk to you. What's the matter? No, I can't talk right now. - Well let's go to the drive-in. - No, I don't wanna go to the drive-in. Come on, why not? Because I'm not in the mood. Look, is anybody in your room? - Yeah, there's a bunch of people here. All right, I guess we have to. What's playing? - We could see "Eat Your Heart Out." No, I don't wanna see that. - What about "Maidens of Satan?" Come on, you can't beat that. What time are you gonna be here? - I'll pick you up in a half hour. See ya. Be ready. - Well I'm gonna have a scotch, what would you like? A little wine if you have any. Yeah, I think I can handle that. Sorry this place is such a mess. I wasn't expecting you to come over before the movie. - You wanna see a mess, come over to my place sometime. Is that a proposition? - Are we going back to your apartment? - Actually, no, I've got something I gotta take care of. I thought I might drop you off and then call you tomorrow night and we could maybe- Tomorrow night's bad for me. Well how about this weekend? We'll see. Okay. These movies any good? - Actually, the second one's not bad. Yeah but how come nobody's here? Because they suck. Hello. Two? Nine dollars, please. - Nine bucks, look, I don't wanna buy the movie, I just wanna see it. - Look, I don't set the prices, hun. Next time, come to the matinee. Very funny. Got your money, Cath? There you go, thank you. - Miss Lake, don't go in there! Don't go in there! Did you see that? - This is the most disgusting movie I've ever seen Well you don't have to look. Very funny. - Come on, Cathy, what the fuck's the matter?! I don't feel like it. Why not? You got your period? No, you've just gotta take me home. - I'm not taking you anywhere until you tell me what's the matter. - I went to see the doctor this morning. - Yeah, you sick or something, what? No, not in the way you think. What are you, knocked up? Cut it out! Come on, Cathy. Shit. Who the fuck is that? Son of a bitch. I bet it's Johnny. Where are you going? Just shut up and wait here. Listen, John, you fucking pervert! I'm gonna kick your ass in! Tom? Tom? Tom? Tom? If you think you're funny, you're- What was that? What, John? - I thought I heard somebody scream. - It's a horror movie, what do you expect? - I mean it, jar head, just don't let me catch you. Cathy? Shit. I couldn't find him, Cathy. So, what're you, mad at me or something? Come on, you coming back here or what? Okay, go ahead, see if I give a shit. I'll watch the movie. You and your fucking moods. Oh. Hello? Julie, where have you been? I've been trying to call you all night. Cindy? I'm killing some time. What do you want? Do you know it's 1:30 in the morning? - You know the girl in one of your classes, Cathy Hunter? Yeah, what about her? She's been killed. What? - They found her body at the movies a coupe of hours ago. - Mark and I were at the movies tonight. It was a the drive-in. - What happened, did they say? - I don't know, that's why I called you. I thought maybe you had heard something. Look, let me call you back. There's somebody I have to call first. - Wait a minute, who're you gonna call, Mark? Yeah. Forget it, Julie. He's not home. I've been trying for hours. Oh my God. Julie, are you there? - Cynthia, look, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Good morning, Miss Parker. Good morning, Mrs. Bloom. You look a little pale. You're not getting sick, are you? No, I had a rough night. - Oh, you know, I couldn't sleep either. Just before I went to bed I heard what happened at the drive-in theater. Imagine, right here in town. It's no wonder thinks like that happen. Them showing all those horror movies. Puts ideas in people's heads. I don't wanna talk about it. Yeah, neither do I. Good by, Mrs. Bloom. Have a nice day. You transferring out already? This is your first semester. - I transfer out every semester. - Hear what happened to Cathy last night? No, what? She got killed at the drive-in. No shit. What was playing? I'm sorry I'm late. I trust you all heard what happened to Cathy. Is there anyone who would like to say anything about it? Yeah. Are you going to postpone the papers or are they due today? - I can't tell you how deeply sorry I am about what happened, Mrs. Hunter. We're all quite shocked by the loss of Cathy. She was a fine student and I'm sure she'll be forgiven of all her sins in the next world. - If I knew she was having problems, maybe I could've helped her. That's why I wanted her to come here. I thought it might be a good influence on her. - I don't want you blaming yourself. Cathy feel a preyed to the many evils of this world. - Father, I want the service to be very simple. I've been under a great deal of stress and I don't know how long I can last. Of course, I understand. I'll do everything in my power to help you through this crisis. Hold it. I trust you heard what happened to the Hunter girl last night. The police will be here to question anyone who knew the girl. Since she was one of your students, I thought you could offer some assistance. - Look, Father, I really didn't know her that well. Oh, really? Well it's come to my attention that you two had a lengthy conversation yesterday. What did you discuss? It was something personal which I promised to keep confidential. - In light of what happened, do you think you'd tell me? No. I'm afraid I can't do that, Father. I see. Very well. I can't force you to. When the police question you later, I think it would be in your best interest to let them know what happened. - Okay, Gloria, I'll see you tomorrow night. - Father Williams, can I see you? Have a seat. What seems to be the problem? Well there's this guy, Tony, and his girlfriend just got killed and I figured maybe I could help him by trying to make him feel better. So he came over one night. Well, he put his head on my shoulder and I thought he as gonna cry but instead, he started to kiss it. And then he started down towards my breasts and then, then it happened. - Why don't you come to my office around eight o'clock tonight? We'll discuss it further. Will it make me feel better? Hi, Julie. Hi, Mark. I heard about what happened. It's a shame. - Mark, do you think it's someone from the school who killed her? I don't know. They're holding the guy she was with, but I don't think he did it. - You know, I have the strangest feeling about it. I hardly knew her but still. Will I see you tonight? No. Not tonight. How about this weekend? Help take your mind off things. We'll see. Come on, I'll walk you back. - Heard you were at the drive-in last night. Yeah. Beat scene, huh? - Yeah, chick was a bitch, she wouldn't give it up. Shit, I missed everything. - Anyway, she won't go back to the drive-in anymore. - So what're you gonna do, find another drive-in? No, find another girlfriend. I like the movies they play. Julie! My car is on the fritz again. I just had to have it towed. Can you please give me a lift home? Sure, come on, hop in. Great. It's open. - You wanna do me a favor tomorrow? What? - I need to go to the shopping mall. Can you give me a lift there too? I might be busy tomorrow. Mark again, yeah? Yeah. Hmmm. What's "hmmm" mean? Nothing, nothing. You brought it up. Well tell me. - Does he ever talk about Janet Phillips to you? - You mean the girl who was murdered here last semester? No, why should he? I don't even think he knew her. - Oh, Julie, he knew her all right. The night she was murdered everyone suspected he had something to do with it. Why would they think that? Because they hd something going and it just suddenly broke off. - Cynthia, do you have something against Mark? Not that I know of, Julie. I just thought you should be careful. Yeah. - Jesus Chris, watch where you're going! Okay. - Sergeant Miller commented that the killer apparently has no motive for his attacks. He sated that the killer is obviously a psychopath who can not be reasoned with. She was gorgeous. She's a social studies major, man. They're usually ugly but not this one. Anyway, I'm about to get down on her, right? I noticed she's got this thing on her lip, all sore and shit, man. I didn't now if it was a zit, I didn't now if it was herpes. It might have been leprosy. Leprosy? Hey, man, is that contagious? Okay, do I have everyone's? Okay, we're gonna end a little early today. We'll pick up where we left off tomorrow. Julie, what if he comes back? Nevermind. I need your help. You get my car, meet me outside in front. Aren't you coming? I have to lock up first. Here. What took you so long? - Don't ask, I'll tell you everything on the way. - Julie, how did you get his keys? - The girl who was murdered here last semester, he's awfully mysterious about that too. What if he comes back? He won't. - Suppose, just supposed that he does. Okay, this is it. He's on the second floor - I don't even know what you wanna find in there. - I don't know but it might be something that could implicate him in the murders. God, this is so crazy. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. Breaking and entering. We'll each get 10 years, Julie. - Cynthia, I only have 15 minutes to get in and out. Look, I gotta get going, okay? Julie! What? Be careful. Thanks. Hi. Oh. Hi. You looking for Mark? Yeah. - He's not here right now, he's working at the college. Oh yes, I know. - You want me to leave him a message? I'll tell him that you came by. No. See, I wanted it to be a surprise. A surprise? Thanks anyway, okay? Hey, do you want me to take your picture? No, no. - No, wait, I swear to God this is not a line. I have a photography class, I have to take pictures of people in their environments and it'll just take a second. Maybe some other time, okay? I'll see you around, bye bye. Yeah. Right. Come in. Yes? - Excuse me, has Julie been to see you yet? I can't seem to find her anywhere. No, why? - She mentioned she had an appointment with you. I thought I might find her here. Appointment. I have nothing written down but I could be mistaken. When you see her, just ask her to stop by the office, okay? Okay, sorry to disturb you. Mark? You remember the educational journal I loaned you several weeks ago? Oh yeah. Well if you're finished with it, I sorta like it back for my files. I completely forgot about it. I'm going home for lunch, I'll bring it back with me. Thank you. - Look, why don't we just ask Mark about all this? That's the only way we're gonna find out if he's really connected to these killings. - Great, if he thinks we're on to him, there's not telling what he might do. - Why don't we ask somebody who's impartial about it before we jump to conclusions like this. Yeah, like who? Father Perkins? - I don't even trust him with the lights on. What about Father Janson? I mean, he's known Mark longer than either of us. If anybody knows if we're on to something, he'll know. - I've already had several run ins with him. - Well then I'll talk to him, okay? I'll talk to him before he leaves tonight and I'll call you as soon as I get home. - All right, if you think it's the right thing to do. - Listen, you better get back to the school before Mark comes looking for you. Don't say that. I guess I'll give you a call later, okay? Okay, bye bye. - Hey guys, don't you have class now? - Our friggin' teacher never showed up. So, where is she? - I don't now, I seen her car in the paring lot with the lights on. Maybe she's stonnin'. Did you got to the front office? Heck no. It ain't my car. Smells like shit around here. Must be coming from the cafeteria. - They went to get someone with a key. Oh wait, I have a key. Here. Maybe we should wait. No, we'll get it. Oh. Julie! What's wrong? Hey, what's wrong? Julie? Miss Parker! Miss Parker! I've been looking for you. They told me I could find you here. How're you feeling? Look, Farther Janson, I only came to school today to tell you that I'm leaving tomorrow. What's troubling you, my dear? - I just don't feel safe here anymore. - Well I can understand that you're upset now but that's no reason to act rash. You're in no more danger here than I am. Father, I don't feel like I belong here. I never did. If I stay here anymore, I'm just gonna go crazy. - Is your decision to leave anything to do with your relationship with someone on the faculty? What're you talking about? It's not my business, of course, but are you letting your personal feelings interfere with your academic career? My best friend was killed! Oh, I wasn't thinking of that. Why don't you go home and get a good rest and we'll talk about it first thing in the morning, okay? - I'm sorry but my mind's been made up. - Won't you at least think it over? I mean, I understand you're upset and I can sympathize with your feeling but you have to understand my position as well. I have no one to replace you on such short notice. I'm sure you'll see things in a different light after a goodnight sleep. Now, if you change your mind at a today, please call me at any time. I'll be in to lock the building tonight. Okay? Goodbye. - John, what'd the police ask you about? Wanted to know if I saw anything when I was at the drive-in with Aki the other night. - Yeah, they're questioning everybody. Even Father Perkins and Margaret. Father Perkins? What the hell's a priest doing at the drive-in? - He's been humping her for a year. No shit. And I was gonna fuck her. - Miss Parker, what're you doing home? Didn't your school reopen today? Yeah but I'm not returning. Look, I only came by to tell you I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm paid up till the end of the month, so we should be okay. - Well this is rather sudden, isn't it? Don't you like it here? - Look, it just couldn't be helped. - Well, I guess I really should refund your money then. - No, you don't have to do that, forget it. Oh, I insist. I don't want you to think you're being cheated. I'll bring it to you in a little while. That's all right, thank you. Well, easy come, easy go. Tragedy struck at St. Trinity's College again today. Cynthia Lockheed, a sociology teacher was found brutally murdered in a storage closet. Police have shut down the school for the day while they continue their investigation. School official, Father Janson, commented that if this matter is not resolved within the week the school will suffer irreparable damage as a result. Many parents have already stated that they will not enroll their children next semester. This is the second murder on campus in the last two years. Janet Phillips, another sociology professor, was attacked in her classroom last fall. Authorities now believe there is a connection between these murders and the two students who were killed off campus this month. Anyone with any information is urged to call this hotline number. 309-7734. That's 309-7734. Hello? Hello, Tony? It's me, Denise. Denise? Denise who? I remember you. - What do you mean, you remember me? It's just a joke. - Tony, you have to come over right now. I have to speak to you. - You can't get enough of the old guy, huh? You tigress. It's what happened last night. Hey, it was beautiful. - Well, I spoke to Father Williams about it. You what? Why'd you do a thing like that? - I went to see him and it's what he did to me. - Look, I'll be right over, all right? Bye bye. Hello? Hello, Julie? This is Mark, listen. Yes? - Father Janson, thank God you're still in. I was just about to leave. What is it? I have to see you tonight. - Can't it wait till tomorrow morning? No, it can't. I think I know who killed Cynthia and Cathy. - Can you call me at my house in about an hour or so? I won't be here in an hour. - Well if it's that urgent, I'll stay a little while longer but you know you really shouldn't be here after the building is locked. I have to see you tonight. It's very important that I talk to you, please. - I'll leave the east wing side entrance unlocked. - Okay, look, I'll be over as soon as possible. Just a minute, Mrs. Bloom. I'm coming. Mark? - Julie, I tried calling you on the phone but you hung up on me. Let's straighten everything out. What are you doing here? Going somewhere? What's it to you? Now listen to me. You think you know something but you're wrong. Am I? - Come in, Miss Parker, I've been waiting for you. Father Jan- - Please. Close the door. Close the door? Yes. Please, sit down. - Father Janson, I thought I should tell you what I know before I leave. And if you don't believe me, you'll find out for yourself soon enough. What's troubling you, my dear? I think I know Who did it. Did What? Killed Cynthia and Cathy. It was Mark. Mark Hammond? Yes. How do you know this? Hello, is Father Janson there? This is Mark Hammond. I need to talk to him, this is an emergency. He's at the school? With Julie?! No, that's okay, I'll talk to him myself. - Miss Parker, I'm glad you came to see me tonight. I can see that you've let your imagination run away with you and I think I can help you. Then you don't believe me? It's not that simple. I asked you to come and see me many times when you had problems and had you done so, you could've saved yourself from the inevitable. What're you talking about? You really can't see what a terrible mistake you've made, can you? The same unfortunate mistake Cynthia made the other day. Mistake? He tried to kill me. - I know the torment you're going through. I suffered the same damnation before my accident. Before you accident? Yes. I know the temptations of the flesh and the women that arouse them. But I was punished for my sin with the loss of my limbs. It wasn't until after I repented that I regained my strength. I knew what God had chosen for me to do. Oh my God. Confess to me, allow your soul to be damned in hell like the others! No. Please. Is anybody in there? Julie! Oh no. Julie! Hail Mary, the grace of God. Your sins are forgiven. Hello? Hello? Give me the police. Yes, we've got an emergency here. I heard somebody scream. Somebody's trying to break in. Right. Yes, I'll be here, bye. What're you doing here? Did you break in? - Interesting case, Doctor, who is he? Calls himself Father Janson. A Priest? No. Real name's Daniel Grayham. Escaped from Bellevue several years ago. Disappeared from sight. He's been impersonating a priest for the last two years at Saint Trinity's. For two years, huh? That's really something. I wonder how he got away with it? Don't they check references at these schools? They will now. - I damned my soul by allowing these women to drain my precious fluids.
