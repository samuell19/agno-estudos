When the earth emerged out of chaos clear air rose up and becomes heaven foul air comes down and becomes earth Yang air floats and Yin air sinks This is heaven and earth in its early forms In ancient times, heaven and earth was divided into three worlds Gods dominate the world of heaven Humans and barbarians dominate the world of man And demons dominate the world of earth The worlds of heaven and earth check and balance each other Humans and barbarians keep having disputes Expel barbarians, protect our territory Expel barbarians, protect our territory Expel barbarians, protect our territory Expel barbarians, protect our territory Kill-- Barbarians invaded again Humans sent general Jiang Chen to the full-on battle Meanwhile, the ancient demon beast Hou scourged the world To save man from suffering, Nv Wa and Fu Hsi worked together to seal Hou After fighting for several days both sides were exhausted Hou retreated as he fought, with an eager need to survive In a moment of desperation he split his soul Jiang Chen led the troops to fight the barbarians for days on end In the end, the barbarians were outnumbered They fought until the whole army was wiped out His soul was divided into three threads One is sealed by Fu His in eight-diagram formation the other two seized the opportunity and got away Sun, moon and stars in circulation Jiang Chen's obsession with the battle runs deep It attracts one thread of Hou's soul Jiang Chen's obsession is assimilated by Hou's soul The once invincible general is not who he was anymore He loses all his senses Wherever he goes, there is a bloodbath Report General, there is a demon attack All soldiers-- Attack! I am working in a comics company My dream is to become a top-notch painter Though I do common work day in and day out I don't want to be a marksman, making quick money for the boss As a painter, every comic book is like a child of my own I should be responsible for them all the way However, I have a bunch of colleagues who are not so responsible Liu Qing, the receptionist, dresses showily everyday sits around and does nothing Her dream is to one day... date The charming general manager, Mr. Bai Dear Mr. Bai... would you like some coffee? No There is another girl who wants to date Mr. Bai Yan Mei from the Comics Team This is Mister Linfeng He sounds like a leading male actor but his brain is like an ordinary man He's Bai Ze's assistant Mr. Bai, how do you do? This is my best friend, Long Dingdang Feng Xue He's at the top of our company's food chain Leader of Legend of the God of Wind and the chief editor You two, tell me-- what are we highlighting in this comic? no exposed breasts or legs Did I tell you to do it like this? She made a fool of herself again Yes, she's a total joke Don't say bad things about others behind their back What did you hear? It doesn't matter what I heard The important thing is, I've heard that people who gossip... their fake breasts will burst You-- Their hyaluronic acid facials will be rotten She screwed up and other people suffered Why can't I make some comments? Besides, we didn't say anything about you Come back, you two Dingdang Feng Xue's mistakes get Mr. Bai in trouble Just let them say what they want Go away Mind your own business But this comic is about... I decide what the comics are about, not you I'm the one responsible to the shareholders, not you Now go back and add the things I wanted But... There is no but Either you change your style or I'll replace you Just go You're still working late Uncle Long, why is Dingdang not here with you? She said she had plans tonight She left first It's Legend of the God of Wind again I was criticized again today Come on, eat something Thank you, uncle Long What makes me so mad is that Bai Ze has the same attitude with Mr. Lu I don't know whether I should keep doing this Why does everyone want to use vulgar taste to cater to the readers? Regardless of the comics themselves, sometimes the things you love shouldn't be influenced by other people Besides, life isn't all about working, right? You are right, but... I'm shattered by these comics Now I have no thoughts, just a story Do you want to hear it? Sure I remember when I was little, I heard old people say after Nv Wa and Fu Hsi worked together sealing the ancient demon Hou one thread of Hou's soul escaped and possessed Jiang Chen The exhausted Nv Wa and Fu Hsi fought with Jiang Chen for days Just like thisâ€” fighting all day long In the end, Jiang Chen was finally sealed Who... Who's there? Beauty-- why are you here all alone? Heaven changes and the universes overlap The day of nine-star alignment is coming We respectfully await the Lord of Demons' revival Finally the day comes when I break the seal I will bring you with me to rule the three worlds Those who follow me... who submit to me... will have eternal life Wise lord, we will follow you for all our lives I need more, more pure male blood to help me break through the seal We will bring it to you Dingdang Daddy!

If you want to come there won't be a problem I will teach you myself I am busy now Talk to you later Mr. Lu came by He asked that... did you see Feng Xue's comics? They're crap No exposed breasts or legs Nobody would buy it Mr. Lu asked me to recommend this app to you It's supposed to be a hit, a love-training society He said... this is what he wants Pretty women, in good shape The settings are for men not to do anything The system will automatically match you with a beautiful girl for video chat Chat if you like her If not, just shake the phone, and a new girl will show up See? The next ones keep coming up Shake this... Fuck off By the way, Mr. Lu also said that you should see this comic Don't just bury your head in drawings you should know more about market demand Learn from it Bai Ze... you rascal Are you okay? I sprained myself It turns out Bai Ze likes this type It hurts Pass me the water Sit over there I can't move, help me It hurts Slow down Beauty, where are you? I'm tired of being an exorcist The men we save suck Where are you? They're good looking How could they have so little self-respect?

Clear my name Stop laughing Go away, go away We weren't thrown into the river and eaten by fish It's very lucky of us It's a good thing we didn't lose anything valuable Where is my jade pendant? Jade pendant Shut your jinxing mouth Just shut up It's strange-- Where did it go? Don't worry I know a master of divination His skill is remarkable Master A quarter to noon Childe enters the room from the south, sits toward the west, feet hanging over the floor Did you lose something? You are truly a master Yes Is the thing you lost an heirloom? Yes Master, you live up to your reputation I am impressed However... The divination symbol is not auspicious But there is still a gleam of hope Master, please show us how to get it back Yes Please tell us, show us the way Okay Go to Auspicious Hospital and take this to the person in charge I deserve death ten thousand times Master, I got careless I didn't expect the exorcist to come out half way and save these mortals My power is too weak to fight the exorcist I will give you two a chance to redeem this mistake Find it for me now The soul jade... Is it the man's jade pendant? The soul jade almost got us hurt I'm afraid The soul jade is made of extreme yin If a man with extreme yang wears it, it will have yang to expel demons As long as it leaves the body it won't have any effects Go now Yes Thank you Watch your steps Excuse me What medicine do you want? What medicine? Please take this to your master to the master Please wait There is a turnip on this child's head For Xue'er Strange signs appeared in the sky lately Demons appear frequently Last night I did a divination... the results were extremely ominous A disaster will fall upon Feng's family It will be a close escape Today I did the divination for this Childe The results are variable, and you are closely linked to it Maybe there is a gleam of hope The thing he lost is the soul jade It was something demons chase after The way to find it is very dangerous but this man is linked to your fate Do remember to keep him safe Feng Xue, Feng Xue Feng Xue, tie me up It's him Give me your turnip Don't move Lady... the thing you lost is linked to the safety of all people We must find it as soon as possible otherwise there will be a disaster Since the second I saw you, I knew my heart belonged to you Master said... We're destined, you and me You're the most important person in my life Do you have a crush on the girl? Uncle Long said the girl has strong powers Cut the crap The master also said you should keep me safe So I think we should... stick closely to each other It is the best It's not easy to be my man I have some requirements It's good to have requirements Look at me I'm handsome, in good shape, talented, knowledgeable... None of this matters What matters most is that I have money I am very rich don't run I would love to build a golden house for you By then, I can hide you in our love nest Relax Lady To be my man, there is only one requirement It is to be bold I am very bold I did everything my father told me not to do Okay Let's give it a try to see if you can stand it... or not Lady, can you get your hands off me first? Get your hands off me, and then we talk What can I do to get you on board with me? Help me find my heirloom Right on time I need two errand boys I talked for so long, you just need two errand boys Okay, just two boys I can find you 200 boys Go prepare Don't bother We have two boys right here Us Well... This is impossible I am Childe of Bai family If you don't want to do this, just go home Please leave What's the big deal? Childe Let's go Don't go She asked me to be his errand boy Mature men can adapt to circumstances I cannot bear it Think of it this way-- as long as we get the heirloom, your position can be switched It doesn't matter Okay I can be your errand boy But after, you help me find the heirloom Our contract will be terminated Okay As you wish What is this? The symbol of the errand boy A soundless bell When you are free, I'll take it back Can the leading male character be drawn in an uglier way? Yes This is my home Nice house It looks grand What grave did you dig this up from? Throw it out Be careful This is good Throw it, too Open the window, wait for a minute This is my bedroom-- nothing should be thrown out This room looks good I am requisitioning it You take my room, where am I supposed to sleep? Didn't you have rooms for servants? I... What's up? She said she'll sleep in my room Shut up You go sleep there I'll sleep in your room Damn it Well... What is happening? Both hands Hang a copper mirror on the top of door Scatter the beans in the yard Go Go By the way, Dingdang Where did you throw their clothes? I... I can't remember Well, let's decorate the room Okay What are you doing? I... I'm watching you work Watching me work... I bet you're not You know what? If I hadn't asked her for a favor, I'd beat her black and blue When I get back my jade pendant, I will humiliate her a hundred times worse than today How dare you? 999 little beans... You will pick them all up in half an hour Otherwise, You'll have to find the jade pendant yourself Picking... Bitch Wait for it Linbin Dou Zhe Jiezhenlie Qianxing Open Childe pour the water Okay Shut up Who are you bossing around? It is funny Pour the water Go now Childe Bai You've lived on the labor of others all your life Today, you should experience how normal people live I would like to eat something cooked by you How about this-- Childe Why are you still working on it? If you can do this, do it for me and do it now We cannot let previous work go wasted Look at me Well? Bringing tea and serving people I have done it all Now, even Dingdang can boss me around I-- When did I ever take orders from others? You tell me Just think of it as experiencing the hardships of the common people Okay Hardships of common people? Experience it all you want I don't care, I quit Hurry up Childe Childe Have you finished the comics? Bai Ze of The Legend of Demon Seal His plot is so miserable Good-looking men in this world... Why are they such playboys? You followed me So what? I don't want to waste my time arguing with you Who gets the soul jade first? We're not sure yet It's an eight-diagram mirror There's a demon What happened? The mirror changed If there is... really a demon here... No way Damn it There are demons Feng Xue Dingdang Where did you throw their clothes? Clothes... I threw the clothes on the path near the bamboo forest You two Who are you? You tell me Dingdang Damn it Childe Bai I found you the jade pendant Dingdang Look-- It's the lord's soul, desperately trying to get out Look, the soul and the lord are attracting each other When the nine stars align, it will break free You two, go take in more blood for me Okay Finally, this day comes You know some petty tricks, but became so arrogant You use tricks all the time Won't you get bored? What a pity some people don't even know how to use petty tricks Such a fool You think that I don't know you have a crush on that man yesterday? Bullshit I'm not No It doesn't matter that you don't admit it I'm going to tell the lord We were the shoulder armor of the lord By the grace of the lord, We can become what we are now I will never betray the lord Okay... we will see I've got a handle on this problem What do you mean, dad? Lord of Demons Jiang Chen and your heirloom It must... have something to do with waking the demon I know my heirloom is a powerful thing I see the power inside you was just released It could have been caused by the jade pendant Everything in the world mutually reinforces and neutralizes each other I know my Childe must be powerful Uncle Long Who is the Lord of Demons, Jiang Chen? After the ancient beast Hou was defeated by Nv Wa His remaining soul combined with Jiang Chen's resentment which became the Lord of Demons Xuanyuan Jiangchen Fu Hsi used all his power he could only seal Jiang Chen with an eight-diagram formation, but he cannot make it disappear Nv Wa's family became the guardians of the Eight-diagram Demon Seal Pool generation after generation All these years have passed... how can it still cause trouble? This is the responsibility of being the descendant of Nv Wa Let's go We should leave We go first Be careful Let's go Okay Good drawing The next project should be The Legend of Romance Okay Keep up the good work Hello Mr. Lu Mr. Lu Are we taking new projects lately? Feng Xue is busy with The Legend of Demon Seal How about... you let me take charge of The Legend of the God of Wind? How is The Legend of the God of Wind going? Did you add the factors I asked you to draw? We can talk later Umm... Time is fine But I think... my idea is more suitable Forget about being more suitable and as for the time, it will be done in two days draw it my way But... There is no but Draw if you can, If not, get lost Also-- don't do things irrelevant to work when at work But I... Dingdang asked you to go find her Are you still thirsty? Well... Mr. Lu I wanted to show you these pictures Go to my office Okay Lingfeng Feng Xue Dingdang Let her go Otherwise, I will show you no mercy Let her go I... want to the that man kills you with his bare hands You loser I have no interest Do you have a choice? Hurry up, or I may have second thoughts Feng Xue Don't mind me Leave now Feng Xue You can't trust her She is lying to you Don't believe her Feng Xue Okay Time's up I'll make your heroine die in the comics I'd like to see how you'll proceed What's happening? I will not continue working on The Legend of Demon Seal The account's been stolen Delete it, then Publish an announcement and redraw it There's no need I can save the story Didn't you say you'd finish her comics? Why is it not ended? I drew her into a severe injury Before I could upload it, others logged into the account Next time, I'll definitely make her die Good luck Let's go Get up Are you okay? It's been too long , what should we do? How is she doing? How is she doing? She loses too much blood I can only stop the bleeding right now Is there no other way? Barbarians have a magical cure It was made of the heart of Huanghe River Stegodon It was called the heart stone It can bring people back to life, but the place is hard to get to and it is full of danger Can Feng Xue wait for days? There's some old ginseng here It can extend her life a couple of days No matter how dangerous the journey is, I will try my best to find the cure Wait for me The tribe is in the front Be quiet, be quiet Let's go Now It was made of the heart of Huanghe River Stegodon It was called the heart stone it can bring people back to life Is it the heart stone? It's so smooth Will we be discovered? Shut your jinxing mouth Move, move Go now Go I'm sorry, I'm sorry It still hurts No Good Dingdang I'm sorry This time you almost got injured Our family line is cursed I'm born with bad luck Every time I say something, bad things happen and bad things I say always come true But Bai's family has good vibes So our two families made a deal Come on Feng Xue She wakes up Be quiet She's waking up Slow down Sorry for the trouble Thank god You finally woke up Thank you Never mind She still needs to rest for some time before she can move before she can move before she can move All right You should lie down Though the heart stone can bring people back to life, you're still severely injured Just lie on the bed and rest Lie down, be a good girl Don't worry Do you blame me? I raised the sword that day I didn't want to live at that moment My destiny is like this I still die, when the nine stars align When the Lord of Demons is born I'd better use my life to save Dingdang and Linfeng How come... Uncle Long said we still have a chance As long as there's a gleam of hope, I will go with you I don't want to go When I felt death coming, I was terrified I don't want this fate When I was young, uncle Long told me my mission was to seal the demon There will be a big crisis in my life I wait for that crisis every day I wish it would come early, so I can be freed sooner But... I'm afraid it really comes... Actually, I always felt... like I was lost I didn't know what I should do until I met you I finally know what my... true mission is I will go with you to defeat the Lord of Demons, okay? I just want to live now I don't want to be an exorcist I just want to be a common girl and live my life Uncle Long, The nine stars align The Lord of Demons will break through the seal Our clansmen are all exorcists This mission falls upon us Let Feng Xue rest and heal Uncle Long, don't worry No matter what happens, we will come with you Good, that's great Let's go My blood will awake my dead soldiers Quick, go that way It's not good Save the people first Dad Dad, are you okay? Uncle Long, are you okay? Stop him now Dad Hurry up Go, dad Go Go, dad Feng Xue, what happened to you? Right after I changed my password to the account for The Legend of Demon Seal It was hacked The person who hacked my computer changed my comics into a total mess Look at the pictures she drew the rubbish ratio the sick coloring I can't put up with it I know who she is Is it good? It's not bad Stop What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Both of you are sick You can't even pass the Level 2 computer test Tell me-- Where did you find the hacker? What are you talking about? Don't try to slander us Slander! What you did is much worse Yes I heard you in the washroom You two did the hacking So what? I admit, it was us Besides, we're doing this for your own good Look at yourself Busy with your private work and putting the important work aside It's fine you don't want to work but Bai Ze also gets criticized because of you so I helped you, to make you do your work Don't be such a hypocrite Who do you think you are? That's my own private work, it has nothing to do with my job You poke your nose into my private life, what else do you want to do? talking about Bai Ze, Bai Ze all day long Bai Ze has nothing to do with you You think that because you like Bai Ze, then Bai Ze is yours A woman like you? Even if Bai Ze was blind, he wouldn't like you That's right You... Forget it Psycho You think I don't know you like Bai Ze, too? Don't pretend you're somehow better I don't like you I hacked your computer An attractive crazy woman like you Bai Ze won't like you either Okay I'll tell you this-- I like Bai Ze And from this day on, I will woo him We'll just see who wins his heart Stop Shameless What is happening? When will my beloved Dingdang act like this? Make a claim that I was hers... the thought makes me so happy, but shy Come on, drink some water Thank you, uncle Long Uncle Long, I didn't know Feng Xue always liked Bai Ze I always thought she disliked him Mind your own business Right Yan Mei and Liu Qing did the wrong thing But why did I get punished? That's the office rule Do you know... as a person, the most important thing is to be happy Don't overthink it Eat your noodles You have a fair point When you read this letter I was gone As the descendant of a divination family I know my life is reaching its end I can't do any more divination I tried my best, but still don't know how to defeat the Lord of Demons but the diagram says there is a gleam of hope I'm ashamed As an old man, I lived over 50 years I thought I was indifferent to life and death but you-- I always worry about you You're used to doing whatever you want and I didn't want to impose our family's responsibilities on you So I let you be yourself But now I cannot be around you I regretted that after realizing I haven't really taught you anything I'm asking you to take this task But I believe you can do it well because you are my daughter You are the daughter of Long Qiu The rest of your life... I cannot be there for you But I believe that as long as you don't give in, nothing can defeat you Dad Dingdang it's okay, Feng Xue there are things I have to do as a member of Long family you too You have your mission Since we have to do it, Let's fight till the end Feng Xue I'm sorry I'm not good at divination and I'm not as good as my father I did think of a way that might help you I want to have a try Dingdang Dingdang You don't need to say anything Hear me out In your bloodline, there is a strand of Hou's soul If you choose to combine your soul with Hou's, you'll become a demon and lose your senses in the end It's the only way to defeat the Lord of Demons Feng Xue, come near me I will tell you how to draw out Hou's power Lingfeng I'm here, Dingdang Today's weather... is so good Dingdang Dingdang Dingdang Dingdang Well... I'm sorry for what happened just now How could you be sorry? This is a special situation It's good for you to know By the way, next time you should be careful yourself Stand in the back when watching the show Why? You are lucky this time I don't have any motives for you Next time, if you're swayed by people with motives If anything is done, you'll be taken advantage of Bai Ze Mr. Lu Taking so long... The work is like this I actually think she did a good job Where are the factors I wanted? Is this on purpose? Let her go if she can't do it By this time tomorrow, give me something presentable Otherwise, fuck off What? Without me, you're killed by the Lord of Demons already You shameless enchantress, get away from me How could you say such hurtful things? Stay back Stay back I told you to stay back! Chi is coming Just hide Quick Let's go catch people for our lord It seems his soul is incomplete He needs more human blood than ever Okay, let's go now Character's eyes, and mouth... am I drawing a dog's eyes, instead of a man's eyes? Draw it if you can Okay, I will Hurry up, hurry up, sit here You draw the eyes No, no, this is a man, then a woman, a woman... You two are so sweet together I envy you a lot. What do you envy? Envy... Dingdang, I need to tell you something Why do I feel... O-legs A-legs I'm back Do you feel surprised and happy? What? Why put on an unhappy face? She is gone Dingdang is gone Shut your jinxing mouth Don't talk nonsense Uncle Long... is gone, too it's my fault I'm the reason that they're dead In the past, I didn't want to face my family mission Uncle Long and Dingdang died because of me Now the Lord of Demons gets the soul jade and reclaims one piece of his soul His power will be stronger Dingdang used her own life to propel the forbidden divination of Long's family and finds out my body seals the ancient beast Hou A strand of his soul... this strand of soul is held by my family's blood Only at a place of extreme yin air, and inhaling the air into my body, I can awake this strand of soul in my body This way, I have a chance to defeat the Lord of Demons But drawing out Hou's soul might demonize me If one day I lose my senses, please remember to kill me And don't feel sorry for me This is an exorcist's mission Feng Xue Feng Xue, don't! What is all this? What a piece of crap Where are the highlights I asked for? Where are the market factors? Listen to me The comics market is distorted if you follow the trends blindly The company will fail sooner or later Who's in charge of this company? I pay your salary, so you do as I say You draw what I tell you to draw, do whatever I tell you to do Are you done? Besides cursing And shirking responsibilities, what else can you do? The click rate was so low last month all because you wanted to add sexy and violent scenes Good comics are changed into rubbish Pointing fingers when sales decline, always someone else's fault Without you, this team would have made a profit a long time ago Bai Ze, this is how your employees behave? Your name is Feng Xue, right? You're fired Fuck off Feng Xue works for me You have no right to fire her How dare you talk to me like this? You better believe I'll fire you right along with her Don't worry You don't need to fire me I quit! Bai Ze Bai Ze You and your employees are so unprofessional This is a critical time in the project and you're just leaving? Shut up I'm not done yet You know nothing about comics You don't understand what it means to me We want to present good work more than anyone, but you... you just tarnish our work with dirty ideas You are a vulgar man without any taste in appreciating art You... Stop clapping Stop clapping! Go get to work Go get to work I didn't know you had such a temper I didn't expect your temper to be worse than mine By the way, what are you going to do next? I don't know I should finish The Legend of Demon Seal first It's now at the top of the list And it truly is good work Thank you for your acknowledgement This is a great honor of mine Congratulations I want to ask you... When will it end? There's still one final battle left What's your opinion on how should it end? From my viewpoint... You bitch! Unexpectedly surviving... Feng Xue, you go seal the Lord of Demons Go now Go help Feng Xue I can take care of it Okay Childe Bitch, let me go! Kill us now Why can't I control the anti-demon sword? Look at yourself What's the difference between us? We're all Hou's souls now Why should we kill each other? You're already transforming into a demon How about you share the world with me? I am not a demon You're not a demon Then why can't you use the anti-demon sword? Even if I am demonized... even if I die today, I will reseal you into the eight diagrams formation Feng Xue, seal him now Linfeng Linfeng Linfeng Dingdang Linfeng Feng Xue Feng Xue Feng Xue, what are you doing? Feng Xue, it's me You are the descendant of Fu Hsi Bai Ze-- today I use the blood of Fu Hsi I will terminate my bloodline just to reseal you Feng Xue Feng Xue Feng Xue Feng Xue Feng Xue Feng Xue Feng Xue Feng Xue Feng Xue Why are you here alone? Where is Bai Ze? I don't know You know nothing, like a fool The boss invited me back, but Mr. Lu is fired Well... This is my new boss
