[CLICKING] Kansas City. Newark. Shreveport. Fargo. Congratulations, Colonel. You managed to spend more money settling lawsuits and repairing your team's property damage than you did on equipment, training, and overhead combined. That's got to be a first. On the other hand, you haven't actually killed anybody yet. Couldn't you try a little harder? All right. Sure, we've had two years of trouble one after the other. Do you want to know why? Because the... That's a rhetorical question. Do you mind? Personnel. Come on, Colonel. We've given you our best people. With all due respect, General, what you've given us are guys who are really great at following orders and going with the play book. The trouble is with this new stuff that Dr. Keegan has given us, there isn't any play book. It's like I said from day one. What we need are people who can think on their feet, not your standard military issue types. What is it you want, Colonel? I want one more chance with a crew I get to pick. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you kidding me? This whole project is a flop. It's a flop because you've micro managed it into the ground. Now we've proved this idea in the Gulf, smart use of smart weapons, sophisticated tracking intelligence systems, bombs with pinpoint accuracy. Now we can fight foreign enemies with 21st century weapons but when it comes to domestic situations we're still talking about cowboys and Indians. We can no longer afford the luxury of being stupid. We need a fast, strong, flexible way to deal with Cell 7. Oh, no. Cell 7 again. That's right. Dr. Galvin's Cell 7 wants to take over the country and with you in the opposition, he just might make it. You say Cell 7 wants to take over the country? You say they're armed with everything short of nuclear weapons? And you want to stop them with a bunch of toys? Excuse me. I've sent you over 200 pages of memo. Why don't you get someone to read them to you? What we should do is cut off the funding immediately. Pretend the whole thing never happened. Excuse me. EMERSON: Oh, that's right. Let's spend the money on cappuccino machines for yuppie bean counters like you. And pray the media never finds out about it. [WHISTLES] Yes, Dr. Keegan? You want to say something? I resent the characterization of my work as toys. Oh, really? What is it you have there? This uses compressed helium at 200 PSI for propellant. It fires mesh weaved sacks of polystyrene pellets. May I see that? You get a muzzle velocity of 400 FPS and an effective range of... This is a bean bag. It's not a bean bag. It is a mesh weave with polystyrene... It's a bean bag. Would you care to demonstrate how you're supposed to use a bean bag as a weapon? Certainly. [GRUNTS] Any further questions? Look, I don't know what you're so upset about. We got our funding. We got another three months. This is great. Never shoot a senior White House aid. He wanted a demonstration. That's not the... Look, just don't do it, okay? Go on back to your lab. I'm going to start recruiting a new team and don't demonstrate anything. All right? Gotcha. [LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [MEN CHATTERING] SOLDIER: Fall back! We got them over there! Get in there. Out of the way. In there. Bravo, nine, Charlie, over. Boss? Jack? Hey. Boss, I think we got a problem. Where's Vinnie? He's on break. You jerk! Let me out of here. I don't think so. MAN: Stand here or sit down. Maybe try to... Yeah? You know, this young lady's not really enjoying your company. I was wondering, sir, if you would mind leaving her alone? Do you want to make me? I'd rather not. Would you please sit someplace else? Say, "Pretty please." Pretty please. Sure. Thank you. Is this seat taken? Not anymore. Are you the bouncer? No, no. I'm just the owner. Really? You own the Thunder Club? Yeah, well, me and the bank. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Jack! What is it with guys like you? [MAN GRUNTS] How do you always know when I'm starting to have fun? [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] Be right back. Bye. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] How's it going, Jack? [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] Good shot. Somewhere we can talk? No. Now don't get hasty. I like being a civilian. You haven't exactly been a major success since you left the Army, Jack. This freak show packs them in every night, but you still manage to lose money. Your marriage is destroyed. Come on, Jack, face it, you're lost. At least I'm still alive. That's got to be a major plus. You'd lead a small elite force, answerable only to me. Who do you answer to? I don't think you really need to know that. Well, that sure builds my confidence, Colonel. I haven't told you the best part yet. Non-lethal weapons. Say what? A brand new way to deal with difficult situations. Now, look, take your basic hostage mess. The bad guys are on the inside. The good guys are on the outside. Up till now we've only had two choices. Either we sit around with our thumbs up our noses or we go in blasting, shooting everything in sight, including half the time each other. If this project works, we have a third choice. A small elite force, mobile, adaptable, flexible, using weapons that will disable the enemy without doing permanent damage. You've got to be joking, right? It's no joke, Jack. Think about it. Geez. Well, no. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got someone waiting for me that's much more attractive than you are. Jack, I think you better read this. What's that? A letter from the President? It's from the general accounting office. It's a bill. A bill? "AJ7 Abrams battle tank. You owe us 1.8 million dollars!" You didn't bring it back. I was on a mission! Well, you know that and I know that. If anyone asks me I'll deny it. As a matter of fact, I already have. Don't worry. They are willing to work out a payment plan. It's about $1,000 a week for the next 1,800 weeks. Come on, Colonel. Or you can serve a nice little term in federal prison. Colonel. Or you can come work for me. What's it going to be? Who else is on the team? Dr. Alex Keegan is designing all our equipment. But we are going to need a strategy and tactics man. My first choice would be Grey Toussaint. Go and get him. And we're going to need a systems and communications man. I've got a real good list. How about Lewis? Jack, anybody you want except that lunatic Lewis. No problem. [MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] [WRENCH CRANKING] Hey, buddy, I'm looking for a guy called Alex Keegan. [MUSIC STOPS] Well, I'm not your buddy, Keegan's not a guy. [EXHALING] You must be Jack. How are you? You're Alex? I'm Alex. You're an engineer? I'm an engineer. [CHUCKLES]PhD from MIT. So what are you building? Well, up to now, we've been mounting our gear on standard military vehicles and that sort of limits effectiveness. They don't exactly blend in at the mall. So now we're going to use commercially available models, customized to provide the special features we need. Civilian use Humvee. A primary attack vehicle, carrying heavy armor or heavy weapons here, here and here. Plus a 16 millimeter multi-use cannon here. Got some features common to all four, all glass tints to opaque for example. All windshields double as a heads-up display. This is my baby. A Dualie. For when we need power, of course. When I get done with this, you'll be able to tow a freight car up a 45 degree incline. Maybe even go for a two-foot cinder block wall. Thank you very much. Okay, for communications and intelligence, a Bronco, lightly armed but shielded against electromagnetic pulse. Carries a satellite dish and just slightly less tracking gear than an AWACS plane. Oh, and plus a new subcompact Cray super computer vacuumed sealed into the under carriage. Okay. Finally, command and control vehicle. Let's see, light weapons, medium armor, this car will roll 200 miles an hour on a good road. I bet it gets lousy gas mileage. No, actually it gets pretty good, 30 on the highway, 25 in the city. Actual mileage may vary. So what do you think? Swell. That's it? Swell? It's a lot of work here. Okay. Fine. So when do I meet the others? As soon as I hire them. The Crusades were the first great demonstration of the limits of technology in warfare. The peak of 12th century hi-tech was, boom, the ability to work iron to manufacture armor. Now, unfortunately, what was good for the forests of France and Germany was less well suited to the Middle East. Many knights of the First Crusade who rode across the desert in full armor were incapacitated by second degree burns before they... You busy? Absolutely not. That's exactly what I said, Grey. I'm almost through with my dissertation. I could land an associate professorship within a year. Not to mention I'm sort of engaged. Sort of? It's an understanding. We haven't set a date yet. Hey, would you like to be my best man? JACK: Weddings give me nightmares, you know that. You know, Grey, I'll tell you. You seem older. You haven't seen me in three years. Yeah, but much older, like, middle age or something. It's the tweed. It's part of it. What are you, like 28 now? Uh-huh. Yeah. You give off this waft that you're close to 50. Fifty? Yeah. Hey, you drinking a big glass of prune juice in the morning? Jack, I... Eating bran. You getting enough bran? What about Matlock? Why don't you just knock it off? What? This is like the war all over again! You let Emerson talk you into something stupid, and then you turn around and you try to talk me into it. It won't work. Yes, it will. Why? Why do you think I would agree to drop all of this for one of Emerson's fevered dreams? Okay. I'll give you three good reasons. Number one, it's the right thing to do, Grey. Uh-huh. I already saved the world once. That's my quota. Number two, you owe me. I don't owe you. Yeah, you owe me, big guy. I saved your life, remember? [SCOFFS] I saved yours twice. That puts me up one. Okay. All right. Let's move on to number three then, okay? How about you're bored? I'm not bored. No. You're bored. You're bored. I'm telling you I'm not bored. You're in a comatose. Okay, so I'm a little bored. Thank you. [CHUCKLES] Grey, look, think of this as a sabbatical, okay? Instead of teaching history you get to make some. Help me get the task force up and running. Then if you want, you can come back here and you and your fiancee can raise tweed if you want. Who else is on the team? The designer, Alex Keegan, you, me. All we need now is a communications guy. Now Emerson's told me I can hire anybody I want except for Lewis Duncan. So who are you going to get? No. You said I could have cart blanche picking anybody for the team. Except Lewis Duncan. I won't have that, that... Deranged, irresponsible maniac. Thank you. We need a software and communications guy, and he is the best, Colonel. I don't care. You're not going to have him. I don't get it. What is so bad about this guy? [DOOR OPENING] Hey! Hi, Colonel. No kiss? Historic silo 18. Only minutes from scenic Roswell, New Mexico. Watch out for the little green men at the end of the driveway. [LAUGHING] Hey, come on. It's our new base of are operations. What do you think? It's a missile silo. EMERSON: It's decommissioned. Radioactive? EMERSON: Hardly at all. It sucks. Can I just suggest... JACK: It's not going to work. EMERSON: Why not? Because it sucks. Can I just say... I have... It's in the middle of absolute nowhere. It's a missile silo. Does anyone else have a better idea? Yes, I have an idea if you guys would just... Yes! [LOUD UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Converted power plant. You'll have to fumigate it after the freaks leave. They're my customers and they stay. JACK: 5,000 square feet made to order. It's going to be living areas and workshops over here and here. And private sleeping areas there and there. What do you think? ALEX: This is great. I can put some grease racks over there. GREY: North wall would be great for an indoor climbing range. EMERSON: Now, now, hold on here. Just a second now. No, no, we can't do this. No? You know, you wanted me to be the team leader, right? Well, I'm team leader. So we do it my way. Well, as long as I don't have to listen to that noise. Soundproofing. It's doable. Doable. [CHUCKLES] Welcome to our happy home. ALEX: Hey this is anti-traction lube. Can't hurt you if they keep falling down, right? Here's a polymer gel and saturated suspension. Expose it to the air, the polymers link into long chain molecules. Then you get... GREY: Glue. ALEX: Very good. This is a multi-use gun. It will work with about 10 different gas and liquid agents. Cool. Here we have some webbing for when you want to hold somebody still, hopefully on the job. GREY: Tazer gun. ALEX: Very good. These darts can hit you anywhere. It zaps you with a low voltage wave. Exactly out of phase with the central nervous system. Knocks you out for about five, 10 minutes and you're great. I'll try this. What's this? This is some kind of advanced communication device, right? [CHUCKLES] No. That would be my CD player. Something like this work on engines? ALEX: That's a good question. Jack, hi. Oh, hi, Michelle. Oh, these are my friends. This is Alex. Hi, how are you? Grey, that's Lewis. You guys, this is Michelle. Hi. Cool stuff. Jack? What is she doing here? Visiting. You know what? Be really careful with that. Anyway, I guess you'd have to know the frequency and amplitude of the ignition system. I mean, if you had enough amps, you might be able to shut it down remotely maybe with microwaves. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [LEWIS EXCLAIMING] [THUDDING] I guess I fixed it. I guess you did. [LAUGHING] Should we check on him? JACK: You okay? Mom. As okay as it gets. Sorry about that. Ladies and gentlemen, let me present your new teammates. [CAR ENGINES REVVING] Raw power. Command and control. Communications and intelligence. Heavy weapons. MICHELLE: My God, you guys, these are really cool. What is she doing here? BOTH: Visiting. Hey, where's the radio in this thing? [SIREN WAILING LOUDLY] Found it. Sorry. GREY: Classic Army thinking. They put a million guys in Saudi Arabia, thousands of intelligence experts, and they pick me to cross into Iraq under cover like I'm going to blend in or something. Oh, yeah, I love it. Then they tell me who my partner is. Oh, no. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. That's what I said. Anyway, we do the job. We're on our way back. Yellow is a totally incompatible component with... Now Lewis, he's able to turn on a track and get a signal out, but I know that even if the Army finds us, they're not going to be able to do anything before the Iraqis put us up against a wall and boom, boom. Yeah, well, they obviously got you out. [ENGINE STARTING] Ooh. No, no, no, not exactly. See what happens is Jack hears about it. Sees that people aren't doing much of anything. He hot wires a tank. He hot wired a tank? Comes riding in like the cavalry to the rescue. ALEX: Is that true, Jack? No, I was much more heroic but I'm too modest to admit it. Oh, yes! It works. [WHOOPING] What works? Grey's idea. [CHUCKLES] Way to go, Grey. What exactly do you guys do anyway? It's a secret. I cannot tell. Really? I bet I can make you tell me. Really? Mmm-hmm. How? [GIGGLES] Oh, dear. Last one up buys. So did everything work tonight? Or am I crazy? GREY: Yes and yes. Glue gun was a little slow. It wasn't slow. It's because you didn't let it warm up. I let it warm up. You didn't let it warm up. Half the stuff is still prototype. You got to baby it. [BUZZING] [BUZZING] Looks like you buy again, Lewis. Maybe not. [EXCLAIMING] Very funny, Lewis. [BUZZING] Very funny rigging the box. That's really cute. Crazy kids. LEWIS: Band sounds great tonight. Watch your back. Aloha. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] I thought Alex was tabbing it. Cool it. Sooner or later Alex is going to kill you. She's crazy about me. [EXCLAIMS] Dreams. You are sadly delusional. GREY: He's doing it again. JACK: Oh, no. Dance? Yeah. Whatever. [LAUGHING] I used to think that he used some kind of subsonics or something. But they wouldn't work in here. I figure he sprays himself with pheromones, like that stuff they use on flypaper. That's not bad. Only works on blonds. Oh, look who's here. Good evening, Colonel. Can I get you a beer? Enough small talk. Let's go where there's a little less noise. [POOL BALLS CLACKING] Why is she always here? Well, she just sort of wandered in and never left. Like an iguana. And she's the only one around here that can make decent coffee. So what's up? Well, I just wanted to go over the details so you'd be in shape for tomorrow. You'll be proud of us. I'm not going to be there. Good. You abandoning us? Reynolds doesn't want me around to smooth things over when you screw up. So don't screw up. Salute the brass hats, show them the trucks, tell them how you're looking forward to the field trials. Don't shoot anybody, and don't bring her. Project Rolling Thunder has completed phase one of our training. We have met the equipment. It is ours, and we are now ready to move into some field maneuvers. Thank you. I think General McNeil has something to say. Meeting in executive sessions this morning, the committee has decided... That is to say they moved and voted on that since you have not yet demonstrated the practical utility on the project by the agreed upon date... Practical utility? That's the next phase. [SIGHING] Your project will be terminated immediately. I'm sorry. Terminated? General, we're just getting started. Well, can we keep these outfits, Sergeant? [VEHICLES APPROACHING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] I guess I could go back to Caltech. I think it was Caltech. I should be happy I get to go back home to Jenna. What about you, Alex? Maybe it was Yale. What are you going to do, Jack? First thing I'm going to do is order another round. Here, here. No, it was definitely Caltech 'cause there was some palm trees there. Well, I hope you're going to charge it to the project. Our funding will last for another four hours. What project? Four hours? GREY: At midnight the trucks officially turn back into pumpkins. Pumpkins? Pumpkins, babe. We have until midnight to prove the project works? GREY: Yeah. We have until midnight to prove the project works. So? [SCOFFS] Guys, come on. I think we should follow the example of Jack here. JACK: Pull up to the gate. ALEX: Right here. Right here. Whoa. Whoa. Good job. Okay, wait here. It was locked. So? Twenty million dollars worth of equipment, and they put it behind a pad lock? Gotta love government. Tie in to every alarm system within a 20-mile radius. If there is anything happening at all, you got to let us know first, okay? Yeah, I will. Let's go, Lewis. Let's go! [ENGINES STARTING] Bye, you guys. Good luck. Gosh. Where am I? [ROBBERS EXCLAIMING] ROBBER 1: Come on! Get in! Come on, man! [ROBBERS LAUGHING] Hey, you moron. You almost blew us all up. I had to put enough to blow 10 banks. How much did we get, man? Two million, brother, easy. There was a guard in there. So what? For six and a half bucks an hour, he takes his chances. ROBBER 1: Those cops? Shut up. Those aren't cops. Great. ROBBER 2: Let's get out of here. [TIRES SCREECHING] Do you see him? I don't know what the hell that was. What the hell... Get us out of here. Shoot him! [BULLETS RICOCHETING] Let's get out of here! Let's go! Let's go! ROBBER 1: Who are these guys, man? ROBBER 2: I don't know. They are everywhere. [TICKING] [BOTH LAUGHING] [BOTH EXCLAIMING] I think we lost them. Do you think we lost them? Yeah, I think we lost them. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] Here. Try a grenade. Here! [BOTH EXCLAIMING] You guys are so busted. [ROBBERS GRUNTING] You know what? You look like a million bucks. Oh, yeah. Insubordination, failure to obey a direct order, theft of government property, breaking and entering. I could put you and all of your Rolling Thunders away for 20 years. Yeah, but you won't because the project works. You know it. I know it, and now the committee knows it. What you're going to do is be a good little bureaucrat, pretend like the thing was your idea in the beginning and let us get on with our field testing. All right. Huh? You're right. Project works well. You're right, and I was wrong. And? And it works so well that I don't think any more field testing is called for. Your first official assignment. It's something I think you'll find particularly interesting. Since when did you get serious about Cell 7? Since the President told me to. He's taking Cell 7 very seriously these days. Which is why I'm sure he's going to know how well you do on this assignment. [ALL CHEERING] To funding. To Rolling Thunder. Yeah! Can I have a beer? JACK: Shut up. Enjoy yourselves. It's going to be your last ones for a while. What up, Sarge? Shut up, Lewis. [CHUCKLING] [COUGHING] So we did right? So we're back in business, right? You did great, really. You did great. In fact, you did so great, we are officially now out of the frying pan and into the blast furnace. Wow, is that a metaphor? Shut up, Lewis. It's a good thing. Let's go upstairs. To work! JACK: You should have seen us today, Colonel. Everything went like clockwork. EMERSON: The White House sends its regards. ALEX: Oh, socks too? LEWIS: Don't worry, Colonel. The ringing in your ears will be gone by morning. EMERSON: I wish you'd be gone by morning. LEWIS: Oh, excuse me, while I wipe away a tear. JACK: We've been approved to start field trials, right? EMERSON: No field trials. As of tonight, Rolling Thunder is fully operational. We're not ready. EMERSON: You just proved you are ready. A golden opportunity has presented itself. He's kind of cute when he gets all officious like that. I don't like him. Yeah, we don't either, but the computers are wild about him. EMERSON: Dr. Ian Galvin. Formerly the number one shrink at the Pentagon, top consultant for psyche warfare and neuro-chemical R and D. And now? Now he's in Paulette, Washington running a survivalist cult known as Cell 7. Would that be a heavily-armed survivalist cult? Is there any other kind? Galvin wants to change the country, but he doesn't mind killing people to do it, but we've got a source inside Cell 7. He's promised to give us all the info we need to shut them down completely if we get him out first. Okay. Who is he? All we have is a first name, Martin. But we do have his girlfriend, Brenda Miller... That's her? ...currently doing 12 to 20 for armed robbery. Martin wants to see her at the extraction. That's why he made sure she's the only one who can ID him. She helps us, they both get full pardons and witness relocation. She's being delivered in six hours. Your job is to get Martin out. Reynolds is giving you 48 hours to do it. GREY: Impossible. We got this job because they want us to fail. We're going to fool them. We get in. We get Martin. We get out. Get dead. Hey, this is exactly the operation this team was created for. It's sink or swim time. You going to do it or not? Okay. Sure. Yes. No. Not. Definitely not. What? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. What were you saying? No eating in this area! Oh. Are you afraid I'm going to get crumbs on your runway? Look, mister, I... Hey, look at that. A gorilla. So which one of you is Brenda? You don't look like a cop or a fed. Lucky me. Listen, can I interest you in an animal cracker? No? Well, perhaps something in a Milk Dud? What are you? Some kind of junk food addict? Look, I control the Duds. The Duds don't control me. All right? Are you always such a wise ass? Look, I'm sorry. [JACK CHUCKLES] You don't know Galvin, what he can do. We're going to get your guy out. Martin's going to be fine. We are going to shut down Cell 7. Hey. I hope you like flying. Why do we always have to fly like this? There's no soft seats, no drinks, obviously no frequent flyer miles. Yes, Jack. Are you humoring me? Yes, Jack. You don't have to humor me. Sure, I do. A couple days ago, Jenna's father asked me, "What do you do for a living?" Well, I say, "I listen to Jack Dickson complain." [LAUGHING] Well, excuse me, Mr. Ivy League, but I didn't learn how to repress my feelings like some people. Yes, Jack. So what's the story with you guys, anyway? You mean what's the story with Jack? No. Well... Are you serious? Hmm. Yeah? Well, Jack was a tank commander in Desert Storm. Actually they were all in the same unit. They rented Lewis from MIT and Grey was Army intelligence. Thanks. [BEEPING] What about you? Engineering. I specialize in non-lethal weapons. There wasn't much demand for them until I got invited to join the Hardy Boys. LEWIS: Alex? ALEX: Yes. Fold your toys up. Hi. Brenda, right? Hi, I'm Lewis. What? I'm just saying hi. Are we landing? Well, yes and no. No. No! No! [SCREAMING] Hey! You could have told me you were going to do that. I didn't want you to worry. Are you crazy? Crazy? At the university they said I was crazy because I dreamed of creating life. Everybody ready? Okay, gentlemen, start your engines. Alex? How are the trucks doing? Well, the systems I can check look okay. I just hope we didn't screw up a suspension. Well, that would get us off to a flying stop. Yeah. Lewis? Our approximate arrival time is 45 minutes, traveling on a bearing of west, southwest. The Cell 7 compound is located one mile north of Paulette, Washington, population 12,000, elevation 4,000 feet above sea level. Get to the important stuff. Okay, I'm sorry. One McDonald's, one Burger King and no Cuckoo Chicken. You know, when I was eight, I built one of them out of Lego. Miners lived in those barracks 50, 60 years ago. Jack, it's a good spot for a base camp. Gives us foliage coverage, clean view all the way around. It's kind of dusty. Make it so. Ma'am. There you go. So, how do we find our boy? Chanting? Smoke signals? Psychic friends network? There's an envelope waiting for us behind the jukebox at a place called Willy's Cafe. That will give us the when and the where for the extraction. So who's going in? I think we should all get a look at it. Somebody has to stay with her. Oh, she's right. That's really a good point. I'll stay. Down boy. Hey, I'm not going to take off. Of course, you won't. You guys. Come on. JACK OVER RADIO: Okay, we're heading now for our big Saturday night in Paulette, Washington. I'll be here if you need me. How is the equipment holding up? Everything is A-okay. Hey, what does the "A" stand for in A-okay, anyway? Concentrate on the job, will you, Jack? Call me if you need me. Roger Wilco, over and out. Hi. What are you doing here? Jack said I could crash. That okay? Aren't you supposed to be someplace? Like isn't it a school night or something? It's Saturday. Anyway, I dropped out of school. Young lady, how do you expect to make anything of your life if you don't even have a high school diploma? I graduated high school. I dropped out of law school. [COUGHING] [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING]Testing, testing, testing, testing. Don't do that. I'm sorry. So how does it look? Normal. Thirty even. I guess seven of them are staff. How's the food? GREY: Not hot enough. Meet you inside. All righty. Be there in a minute. GREY: All right. All right. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] Wow, when those kids leave, I'll check for the envelope. I'll do it. I'm really perfectly capable. Thank you. I'm sure you are, but I'll do it. What? You don't trust me enough to do that? You know, I think it's time that you and I had a little talk. Okay. Fine. I'll go first. I'm getting a little tired of feeling like the outsider with you guys. I mean, you got the history and all. That's great. But I just feel like I'm the 5th wheel that Emerson shoved down your throat. Wow. That's it? Wow? Yeah. You are so incredibly wrong, it's going to take 12 times of being right to just break even. Oh, God, you know what? Never mind. Sit down! Marital spat. MAN: Yeah. Look, nobody's shoving anybody down anyone's throat. Hell, you know we think you're a miracle worker. How could you not know that? How would I know that? Well... Because... It's a guy thing. Look, it's not like guys to say, "Oh, you're so great." You know, it's not something that we do, but I can tell you that Lewis, Grey, and myself, we all respect the hell out of you, and we really, really want to have you. Excuse me? As a member of the team. Okay. Have you as a member of the team. I think I'll go check behind the jukebox now. Yeah, I wish you'd do that. ♪♪ And you've given everything you've got to give ♪♪ I'll be there to give a little bit more ♪♪ Don't you know that you ♪♪ You can count on me ♪♪ Lewis, don't do it. Don't do what? That thing you do in bars. This is a very bad time to do it. [CHUCKLES] I'm not doing it. Oh, maybe a little bit. Is there anything on my face at all? Yeah, stupidity. Martin? I haven't seen you here before. That's funny because I'm new here. Never been here before really. [WHISPERING] Get rid of her, Lewis. Do you want to dance? No. Not really. I don't want to. Oh, what's the matter? Don't you like me? No. It's not that. It's just that... It's bigger than that. It's... Well, what do you mean by that? Look, I just don't go for this whole sleazy bar pick up thing, okay? Stupid jerk. I can't believe you. Hey, I was kidding. He's here. Where? Over there. Lewis and Grey? [WHOOPING] He's behind. They can take care of themselves. Come on, maybe we can save some time. Hey, buddy. Yeah? Don't we have a friend in common? No, I don't think so. Sure we do. You see, honey, this is why I hate asking for directions. Have we met? Yes. We don't like guys who ask questions. Really? Why not? How come? Let's go. Okay. Do something. On three. One, two, three. [BUZZING]You know, guys, I... Aloha. Hey, we ain't telling you nothing, man. Really? Did you try to beat them to bloody pulps? No. I didn't think of that. See, defenses up? Yes, Jack. LEWIS: So where do you hang out? Any luck? Hey, I'm trying to work here, you know. Excuse me. God knows what he's done to Martin. [BEEPING] Oh, this is perfect. Just perfect. What are you going to tell him? Good morning, Colonel. How are you on this bright, beautiful Sunday morning? Running low on time, Jack. I've got the FBI breathing down my neck. Uh-huh. That's really tough considering this end's totally screwed up. I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Oh, now pretend you didn't hear this. Galvin knew we were coming before we did. Look, here's your extraction plan. Galvin discovered Martin? Give us till tomorrow. See what we can come up with. You've got 18 hours, Jack. Eighteen hours. Pizza. Twenty-eight minutes. Didn't get it for free. They found Martin. LEWIS: Brenda spotted Martin's voice. I've got pulse and respiratory signatures locked. So if he stays on the surface, we can track it. Oh, that's dandy. All we have to do now is get him out. Can't mount a frontal attack. Can't go in by air. I'm open to suggestions, folks. I suggest we order chicken next time. Hey. Didn't you say miners used to live here? So? Doesn't the presence of miners suggest the presence of a mine? Get to go underground. Hey. Are you sure you guys don't want some? Go away. Check it out. Comm set. Hello, comm set. Why don't you go bother Alex? She told me to come bother you. I'm in a geosynchronous orbit 22,000 miles above the surface of the earth right now. I'm trying to hack into a secure channel used for federal data processing. Go away. Come on, it's good. Bye-bye. There's nothing wrong with... Man, they slammed the gate shut, but not fast enough for Lewis. That would be me. Let me dodge this. Lewis? Do we have a password? Yes, we do have a password. We don't. They threw a logic bomb at us. Algorithms fly through the air and slice my forehead, blood drips in my eyes, but I'm okay. That... That's it. I'm waiting outside. Wait, wait. Wait a sec. Wait a second. Wait a second. We're in, dude. United States bureau of mines official record archives. How many of us employed? What do you mean it's not there? It's been deleted last month. Cell 7 has some pretty good people. Yeah, they are pretty good. Not as good as me. I know where the original copy is. Where? I'm going to hate this, aren't I? Millions of bucks of electronic equipment, and I gotta pick a damn lock. Why don't you try sliding yourself under the door, Grey? [BURPS] Excuse me. You sure you cut the alarm? LEWIS: Yeah, of course, 100 percent. You know, I gotta tell you this is the worst pizza I've ever eaten in my life. I noticed you're still eating it. Well, that's because it technically is still pizza. Oh, man. You were right. We're in. Okay, Grey, I've got some good news and some bad news. What's the bad news? Well, the bad news is that alarm thing I told you about earlier... Turns out that I'm kind of wrong about it actually. What's the good news? On second thought, there really isn't any good news. Keep on going until we give you an abort, Grey. You know what? Hey. Patch into the cop house. I'm there. I'm there right now. There's no response. Oh, for crying out loud. What? It's like Fort Knox in here. I got a Chase 2,000. Two dials, six pins. Can't they find anything better to spend their money on? Can you get in? Before the cops show up? Not bloody likely. [BEEPING]They're running a circuit check. That's number one. Hold it, Grey. Stick your mike on the dial plate. What? Stick your mike on the dial plate. Just do it. [BEEPING]That's circuit check number two. Bring up the sound, way up. Grey, turn the left dial slowly. Can you mask that? [BEEPING]We just got our third circuit check. Okay, mask these frequencies. I'm trying. Come on. Just do it. Okay, that's it. That's it, Grey. Go to the other dial. [DRILLING] [BEEPING] GREY: Got it. [CHUCKLING] What do you want? A doggy biscuit? [SIRENS BLARING] Let's go, Grey. Presto fortissimo. Go. Guys looking for somebody? [BEEPS] Oops. Didn't there used to be two of those? You did what? JACK: We're doing the job. You committed like nine federal felonies. Excuse me, Colonel, but whatever happened to, "You're in charge, Jack. Do what you have to do, Jack." I mean, if we'd gone through the right channels we'd been waiting six months. When did you go in? Dawn. Emerson, shouldn't you be doing your Buns of Steel workout right now? Get off the line, Lewis! Is there anything else, Colonel, sir? They burglarized a federal documents repository. That was not in the plan. That's bad, right? [EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST] Hey? Grey? Hey, you awake, man? Grey, hey. You awake? Yeah. You think much about your childhood? Lewis, it's 3:00 a.m. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Otherwise I might have to get some sleep. Looking back at your childhood in retrospect, would you say that you had a happy childhood or not? Lewis, what I think is a guy who asks a question like that, what he really wants to do is talk about himself. Because I didn't have a happy childhood at all. Why was that, Lewis? I was really smart, you know? I was like freakishly smart. I remember when I was seven... Oh, God! And I was still in regular school, right? I remember noticing then that the kids that got made fun of the most were the really smart kids and the really dumb kids. Me and Bobby Lorenzo. This kid that wrote his S's backwards. We were like these designated targets, you know, like walking targets or something. Lewis, I'm very sorry. I sympathize. I empathize. I share your pain, but you got to put it behind you. At least tonight you do. Tomorrow's a big day and we kind of need to be awake during it. Right, yeah, yeah. You're right. Thanks for listening, man. Any time. Good night. Good night. Hey, Grey? What? You know the whole thing about putting it behind you and moving on, that doesn't fly for me. I can't do that. I have this curse with this total recall. I remember everything. Every H.R. Pufnstuf episode. Every log table. What Eddy Oz called me in first grade. Lewis, two things. First, you want to carry this around so you can drag it out and wallow in it, fine. Just don't do it out loud because it makes you sound like a real dope. All right. Yeah. Second, as much as I like you, and though it would cause me great personal anguish, I hear one more word out of you, and I'll have to come over there and batter you unconscious. Am I making myself clear? Yeah. Good night. Good night. Okay, Lewis, what was it? What was what? What Eddy Oz called you in the first grade? I can't remember. ALEX: I love this truck. Whatever happened to "good luck"? Break a leg. ALEX: We got you monitored. So we can track you all the way to the compound. The bad news is the roof could fall in any second. But the good news is there's no sign of rats. Do you plan on joining us? Sure. Yeah, while I'm still in my 30s. It's not so bad, huh? Come on, Jack. She's a little scared. Well, tell her the secret. The secret is you pretend you're not frightened and after a while you fool yourself. Right. And that works? No. Shall we proceed? ALEX: You know, I put a lot of work into this truck. Can't you clean it once in a while? I did. Hey. Are you attracted to me? You want an honest answer, or one you can live with? Hey, look. They're too deep for the signal. What about Martin? No, no. I got him... That's really weird. What? The Cell 7 guys, I just lost half of them. What are you talking about? They left the compound? No, because I would have seen them cross the perimeter. I don't think... Wait, wait, they just went down. They went down to the mines. What? Hairspray. It's a metal embrittlement agent. It's a trap. Get out. Do you hear me? I repeat. [RADIO DISTURBANCE] Come on. [HIGH-PITCHED DISTURBANCE] [GROANS]What? What? High frequency audio damper, and they're jamming the radio, and they're throwing out a heat blanket to mess with the thermals. I hate these guys. Great. No eyes. No ears. Damn. Okay. We're underneath the compound. So from here on, we make as little noise as possible. Okay? On the other hand, I guess it doesn't really matter. Martin? Baby, what are you doing here? My God! What are you doing here? GALVIN: You're late. I knew sooner or later they would send somebody to try and stop me. [CHUCKLES] But it's too late. The blood-dimmed tide is about to be loosed. Yeah, yeah. Yes. Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born. You know the poem? Hey, freshman lit, three times. Your name is Lieutenant James Joseph Dickson. You are 32 years old. You have spent 10 years in the Army, and your blood type is B positive. Did you get all that from my eyes? No, Lieutenant, I got all that from your fingerprints. And I got a lot of stuff that's not in your service record. I know about your miserable childhood, about your failed marriage, and I probably know the real reason you left the Army. So I was a bed wetter. Why don't you shoot me? You mind if I ask you a question, big boy? How come an underground group like yours has a logo? I mean, gee, is it for merchandising? You have got no idea what you wandered into. Nobody in Washington does. But they're about to find out. [BEEPING] Nothing. Nothing. I can't break the radio jam. We got to get in there. If we go in there without pinpointing exactly where Jack and Grey are, they might as well be dead. Okay, so how do we do that? I don't know. I don't know. Think of something. Wait a second. What audio frequencies are they blanketing? Full voice range 700 and up. Okay, you were monitoring them when they went in the tunnel, right? Yeah, right. No, no way. It will never work. Twenty bucks says it does. If Cell 7 is so great, why haven't you guys got a better name? Like Subversionanza. Lieutenant... Or the Revolution Boys! Lieutenant? Or even Cell 8. Your friend isn't doing nearly as well as you are. Nothing funny to say, Lieutenant? What about Grey? I'm going to give you a chance to save his life. A contest. You win, he leaves here with a list of our demands. You lose, he accompanies the same list. At least his head does. The man you'll be fighting is a interesting case, a Somalian irregular, blinded by a faulty grenade. But since then his senses have gotten increasingly sharp, and he's become more and more psychotic. Since he can't see, it's only fair that you be blindfolded. You try to take the blindfold off, your friend is dead. [CROWD CHEERING] May the best man live. [CROWD CHEERING] Yeah! Oh, we got 'em ! Pay me later. [GRUNTING] Strangle him! Strangle him! Kill him, kill him. Congratulations, Lieutenant. You may take your blindfold off now. Grey. Oh, my God, what have I done? [SOBBING] Oh, God. You're very good. Are you kidding? I was perfect. So when did you figure it out? Blind Somalian? Yeah, right. Kill him. Shoot through me if you have to. Ready, aim... I got Jack and Galvin. You get Grey and the others. LEWIS: Got you. What's the matter? You couldn't cut it any closer? ALEX: Get in. Let's go. Move back. You moved my seat. Get in the back. Take it... Take it easy. [BRENDA SCREAMING] It's just a flame thrower. Relax. [GROANS] Tell me when you do that. [DRONING] MAN: It's going to blow, run. This is not good. Did you guys kill all those people? No, we didn't kill anybody. Those were just concussion bombs. They are going to wake up with the gnarliest headaches in the world tomorrow morning. [BEEPING] Alex, you got three blimps in cold pursuit. Got it covered. The best laid plans of mice and loonies often go astray. Game's not over. The Bronco up ahead, how much armor does it carry? [RADIO JAMMING] We're being jammed. Of course, it's jammed. MAN ON RADIO: Target the green Bronco. The green Bronco. What are you doing? Quick, jump out. Grab me a rock. What? Just get out there and grab me a rock the size of a tennis ball. What? You think I'm going to drive off and leave you? Well, well, chivalry is not dead. Please do not speak to the driver when the vehicle is in motion. [YELLING] That's what I thought... I thought I saw... What just happened? I don't know. What do you think it was, Lewis? A helicopter with a missile aiming right at me, firing at us. Yeah. Yeah, and I think they're coming back for more. [CRASHING] I don't even want to know. ALEX: You guys are so lucky to have me. As a member of the team. Have me as a member of the team. Not too bad a job considering you didn't follow the plan. Well, sir, maybe you should have run it past Galvin. We'll meet again, Lieutenant. Excuse me. I'm off the clock. OFFICER: Come on, let's go. Jack. JACK: Oh, Emerson called. He said everyone in Washington wants to know how he did it. Last one up buys. So, Alex figured out they were jamming full voice range. And? Lewis got a signature off your stomach. It's only about 500 cycles below the jamming, and there you were. [BUZZER RINGING] JACK: Wait a second. Let me get this straight. LEWIS: Hey. Now do you mean to tell me that I owe my life to bad pizza? That is just so undignified. That's really funny. That's really funny. You put glue on the buzzer. Now come on. Help me down. Band sounds great tonight. You guys coming? Hey. This isn't funny. Sure. Who's buying? Last man down. Okay. That was really funny. Help me down. Aloha. Come on. This isn't funny. See you. LEWIS: You guys.
