[roaring] [ominous music] [engine pulsing] - Starboard-a-helm! Steady as you go. Wolf's fang rock ahead! [engine pulsing] - That'd be the last. - Aye. We should've laid off till the fog lifted. - There are things to do, Hamp. It's been left long enough. - Suppose you're right. There's the island. [boat creaking] We'll need this? - Aye. [gasping] [suspenseful music] Who is it? - Don't know. - Been dead long? - About a week. - Better get to the lighthouse. - Yeah. [suspenseful music] [door creaking] Dad! Dad, come quick! [gasping] The head, it's... [shouting] [suspenseful music] [light thudding] - Look upstairs. I'll try outside. [door snapping] [door creaking] [clothes swooshing] [suspenseful music] [groaning] [screaming] [groaning] [screaming] [thudding] [screaming] [thudding] - Is she always like this? - Yes, Superintendent. In a complete state of catatonic stupor. - What caused it? Was it the blow in the head she got from the fisherman? - No, no, it did no brain damage. The superficial contusions have healed now. No, this is psychological. Mental regression. - How long will it last? - That's impossible to say. What has probably happened is that her brain has become overloaded by the horror of what it has done or seen. So it's only recourse was to blow the fuse so to speak. - What, like a machine that short circuits? - That's roughly the analogy. What we have to do is find the fault and correct it. Otherwise, a fuse will blow again as soon as the machine restarts. - And how do you find it from this? - The injection please, nurse. What we do is to inject a drug that jolts the brain into activity for a short while, and we delve for the causation of the trauma. It takes a long time though. We'll have to be careful. Very careful. Perhaps you could remind me of the facts you have on this girl, Superintendent. - Well she's Penelope Read, age 18. She comes from Denver, Colorado. On the sixth of last month she arrived in this country with a friend, Miss Mae Harvey, same age, also from Denver. Object of visit to tour Europe. - Mae Harvey, she was the bloodied girl? - Yes. - And the two dead boys? - Also American, also on a vacation tour. The four of them went to a jazz festival in the west country. When the festival was ended they hired a boat set off for Snape Island. - What made them pick that island? - They wanted to go somewhere quiet and a boy they met at the festival told them of the disused lighthouse. - The window please, nurse. - That baffles me, Dr. Simpson. Why should a young girl suddenly run amok and butcher three friends in such a brutal manner? As well the fisherman John Gurney. - That's what I have to find out. Now, Superintendent, if you could stay behind the chair, and please don't make a sound. Not at any time. It could be extremely damaging. What were her friends Christian names? - Mae, Gary, and Des. - Mae, Gary, and Des. Here we go. The drug's taking effect. Penny, can you hear me, Penny? Penny? Can you hear me, Penny? You are on the island, Penny. You are on Snape Island. Penny? Can you hear me, Penny? Penny, you are on the island. You have just arrived on the island, Penny. With Mae and Des and Gary. Do you hear me, Penny? You are on the island with Mae and Des and Gary. - On the island. - [Dr. Simpson] With Mae. - Mae. Mae. Mae was frightened. Mae was frightened. Isn't it great? Mae was frightened. - Far out. Hello? Anybody home? - Mae was frightened. Let's go! Mae was frightened. - [Dr. Simpson] Why was Mae scared? - Anybody home? [ominous music] - [Gary] Come on, Mae. - What's your problem, Mae? - I don't like it here, Penny, it gives me the creeps. - What? - Can you feel it? I'm scared, Penny, let's go back. - [Gary] But it was your idea to come to the island. - Hey, there's a bedroom up there. What's with you? - Mae's uptight about the place. She wants to split. - But it's terrific here, just like the kid said it was. We have sounds, food, and some great grass. This place is really far out. - It scares the hell out of me! - [Dr. Simpson] Why, Penny, why was Mae scared? - I don't know. But I'm scared. - Scared. Mae was scared. - [Dr. Simpson] Why was Mae scared? - I can't help it. There's something about this island. - She's psychic. - In that case, let me get out my Ouija board. - Oh loosen up, Des, some people get vibes. - Vibrations. Evil, evil. What kind of feelings do you get, Mae? - Evil. I get feelings of evil from this island. - Ha, that's just me wanting to boil you? - Come on, Mae, we're here to have fun. Now snap out of it. - [Penny] Evil. Feelings of evil. Snap out, snap out. - Snap out of it, Mae. - Snap out of it. Hot. Hot. Swim. Swim. No. No. Moon. Moon! Moon! Moon! Moon! [ominous music] [moans] I'll dry that part myself, thank you. - Shit, I get the only chick in Europe who doesn't want to get laid. - I told you before we came, I don't. That doesn't mean I don't want to. - You drive me crazy like that. For Christ sake, I'm a man. - And I know how to take care of a man. And I will, promise. Oh, will you look at that moon? It's too much. - Yeah. Penny? Can you take care of me now? I'm going insane. - All dressed up and nowhere to go. [screaming] [ominous music] [screaming] [panting] - Alright, release her now. - Did you learn anything? Because I can't say I did. - I learned that the trauma is fear induced. The rest is a mystery. - Well, there's no official mystery. The case is closed as far as we're concerned. The coroner will return an open verdict. It'll stay on file until this young lady is fit to plead and take her place in the dock. [ominous music] - Ba'al. - Mr. Brent, good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Bakewell. - Now let me introduce you to the others. Rose Mason, one of our foremost experts in Phoenician art and culture. Rose, Evan Brent. - How do you do? - Hello. - And this is Dan and Nora Winthrop. Dan will hear head our expedition. - Is that the spear? The one found on the island? - Oh, indeed it is, Mr. Brent. One of the most exciting archeological discoveries made in this country over the last 30 years. - What's so special about it? - It's Phoenician, Mr. Brent. And what is so special about it is that it's made of gold, solid gold. - Must be worth a fortune, eh? - That's not quite what Ms. Mason meant. The material value of it is of no great importance to us. Though the spear would be worth over 10,000 pounds for its gold content. No, what Rose meant was that that is a Phoenician ceremonial spear. - Now spears like this have been found before, Mr. Brent, but never in this country. And when they have been found, it's always been at the sight of a chief's burial ground. - So we expect to find a sarcophagus on the island or under it in one of the caves. - Our theory is this, about 3,000 years ago a Phoenician trading ship landed on these shores. The captain of the ship, probably a foremost man of his country, died and was buried in some secret place on the island surrounded by his treasures. And he was placed in front of a statue of Ba'al. - Ba'al? - The Phoenician God. Every ship they sailed in carried a replica of the god, usually in gold. - And that's what we hope to find, Evan. - Sorry I'm late. - Come in, Adam. - [Rose] Adam? Somebody must be joking. - Hello, Rose, how are you? - I suppose I should be speechless. - That would be a moment to treasure. The last time I spoke to Rose she was breaking our engagement. One of your more deplorable lapses of taste. - Laurence, Adam Masters is out of the question. - Nobody asked one. I nominate which members of my staff go on expeditions, and I reserve the right to choose the best people for the task involved. I must admit I did not realize that there was a problem of personalities. - Oh, there'll be no problem, Laurence. Surely not after all these months. - Of course not. You've made my day. - Ah, good. Adam, I don't think you know Evan Brent. - No, I don't. How do you do? - How do you do? - I should explain what Mr. Brent will be doing with your party. Or perhaps you'd prefer to do that yourself, Evan? - If you'd like, Mr. Bakewell. I've been engaged by the parents of Penelope Read and they. - That was the girl that murdered those poor kids and the fisherman. - Is alleged to have murdered. Now we know that she killed John Gurney, but that was when she was completely insane, and I believe it was an act of self-defense. - I must say there's no doubt in the minds of the police. They're convinced she killed those people and regard the case as closed. - Well I think you can see that the parents of the poor girl cannot agree. They've engaged me to come over here and make a private investigation. So when I read about your party going to the island. - I was only too pleased to help Mr. Brent. - I think there's something I ought to tell you. You mentioned this god Ba'al. I have a transcript of an examination made by Penelope Read's psychiatrist. Among the 10 or so words that she uttered when under drugs, was that word, Ba'al. Now who or what was Ba'al? - He was the Phoenician god of fertility, Mr. Brent. He was often worshiped by orgiastic ritual. Later in the course of time he came to be regarded as evil by the Hebrews and the Christians. In fact he came to be associated with the devil. - Strange, isn't it? If you were a follower of Ba'al today, you would be accused of devil worship. [suspenseful music] [seagulls squawking] [chattering] - Why don't you try and get her back, Adam? - Perhaps it's because I'm a great believer in the adage that there's nothing as broken as a broken romance. - I never heard that one before. - Hardly surprising. I just made it up. Why such interest? - It's quite simple, darling. If you have her it means that Dan can't. - Dan? What are you giving me? - Didn't you know? It's been going on for months. - [scoffs] I can't believe it, not with Rose. - Well, don't then. - Have you got any proof? - Would you believe Dan asking me for a divorce so that he can marry her? - Ironic, isn't it? You remember that night in the hotel in Cairo? - When she found us? You should've locked your bedroom door. - If you remember it was you who came into my room looking for something to read. I wasn't expecting to be seduced. - It was a hot night. What's a girl to do when her husband's away? Masturbation is so boring. - What are we going to do about us, Rose, when this is finished? - As I told you in London, Dan, it's over. - I don't believe that. [seagulls squawking] It would be different if Nora would give me a divorce. - She won't, and even if she did. - The boat's all loaded, Mr. Winthrop. - Thanks, Hamp. I'll get the others and we'll come on down to the jetty. - Mr. Brent's down there already. [knocking] - The boat's ready. - Come on, love, all aboard. [suspenseful music] - How long will it take us? - Take us to what, love? - Get to the island. - A couple of hours. Time enough for one of those shipboard romances. - Don't bust your jeans, kid. I seldom make love to strangers and never while my husband's watching. - You outta give it a go. You might find he likes it. - It's not him I'm worried about, Sonny, it's you. You look a trifle inexperienced. You know big on chat, small in everything else. [seagulls squawking] - We were lucky to get you to take us to the island, Hamp. Nobody else in port really seemed to want to go. - They don't like the place. - Because of the rocks? - There are other reasons. - Such as? - The island has a bad name, Mr. Brent. Always had, always will. - Especially after the death of your father and those three American kids. - Won't make it any better. - Well that make sit even harder, you're being so willing to take us across. - Well if I hadn't, you'd have found someone. - Hi. Looking forward to it, working on the island? - They're paying good money. Better than working in an office. - Is that what you usually do? - Are you kidding? Tried it once when I left school, gave it up after a month. I must've had 100 jobs since then. - Just a rolling stone, huh? - Wish I was. Now that's the game. Plenty of bread and the chicks. But I never work during the summer. Go abroad, play around at the beaches over here. Go to a few jazz festivals. It's a good scene if you don't weaken. - Must be a great life. - As I said, it's better than working. - Have you known Hamp Gurney long? - All my life. He's a relative on my mom's side. [ominous music] - [Evan] There's the island, straight ahead. - So that's Snape Island? - That's it. As far as I'm concerned you can have it. - Been here before? - Me? No, never. - Sit down, everyone! I can't see to steer. The boat touches one of those rocks it'll rip the bottom out of it. [water swishing] - Starboard-a-helm, Hamp! [waves crashing] Hard-a-starboard. Hard over! - I wouldn't like to do this trip on a stormy night. - Yeah, it can be pretty hairy. - You been here before, Mr. Brent? - Well, we're here. - I'm glad that's over. - You alright, Rose? - Yes. - When the hell am I going to get off? - Stope moaning, Nora, for God's sake. - There you go, love, minor step. - Make the line fast, Mr. Masters. - Thank you. - Any time. - I'll keep that in mind, but only if it's absolutely necessary. - Brom, give a hand with the unloading. - Yes, Hamp. - That's strange. - What is? - The seagulls. - There aren't any. - That's what's so strange. Mr. Gurney, why aren't there any seagulls? - Seagulls don't nest on Snape Island. Never see a seagull on Snape. Never have, never will. Come on, we've got to get unloading if we want to get in by nightfall. - [Evan] There it is. - [Dan] It's a pretty derelict looking place, isn't it? - [Hamp] Anything you don't need right away you can leave in the shed. [thudding] - [Nora] Huh. - [Rose] What is it? - That's where they found my father. - You're very brave coming here after such a terrible tragedy. - Fisher folk are used to tragedy, Miss. - This is where the other body was found. - It took a great deal of strength to drive a spear right through a man's body like that? - Yes, much more than Penelope Read would've manged. - I don't know, she was mad, and insanity can give you superhuman strength. - That's what the police say. - [Dan] And what do you say, Mr. Brent? - What do you mean? - Well, you present us with an interesting thesis. If the girl didn't murder those kids, who did? - Somebody else, obviously. - But who? There was nobody else on the island was there? Was there? - Brom, let's get on with the unloading. - Yes, I suggest you two girls stay here and look into the accommodations. - Do you want me to sort out who sleeps with whom or shall we draw lots? - Now don't be funny, Nora. We're here to do a job. Let' sleave our personal lives out of it, shall we? - I'll do my best, Dan darling. But you know what I'm like at night. I like to sleep beside a man, which makes me wonder why on earth I married you. - Come on, Dan, let's go and help the others. [clattering] [suspenseful music] [waves crashing] - The wind's getting up. - Don't, Brom! - What's up? - We all will be if you aren't more careful. They're dynamite detonators. - What have you brought dynamite for? - In case we have to blast our way into the caves. - What caves? There are no caves under this island. - You're wrong, Hamp. With a rock formation like this there has to be. - Hamp's right, there are no caves on this island. - How do you know, Brom? I thought you'd never been on the island. - Well... I never heard of any. - What a mess! - Hmm. - We better start cleaning up the place. - What's upstairs? - A bedroom and a lot of blood stains. - That's where the girl? - Lost her head? There's a few girls who've done that in a bedroom, Rose dear. - You're a hard bitch, Nora. - Don't let me fool you, Rose. I'm as soft as butter really. Except when somebody is trying to take something that I want. Then watch it, baby. - Get off my back, will you, Nora? I don't want Dan and if he wants to leave you it's because he wants to leave you. Oh, he thinks he wants me, but it's only because he doesn't have the guts to walk out on you and be on his own. What he needs is a woman to hang on to. [clattering] - He's been sleeping with you. - [scoffs] Now you're not going mad on me, are you, Nora dear? [snickering] [suspenseful music] - Put that down. - I'm sorry. I don't know what for, but I'm sorry. - My brother. My brother Saul and his wife Martha. - They look so sad. - They had an unhappy life. - Had? They're dead then? - Six months ago. Saul's boat was washed up on the mainland. We never found their bodies. The currents 'round these coasts are very treacherous. - You mean they lived here, here on this island? - These 20 years past. - Well, that's a very lonely life for a young married couple. What possessed them to come and live in this godforsaken hole? - Saul was a lonely man. - What happened to the baby then? - Died. Died these 10 years since. - Well, there's one thing that's certain. - What's that? - That this is not the luckiest island in the world, is it? - That'd be true. Snape Island never brought anything but unhappiness, tragedy for anyone. [ominous music] - Penny? Penny, can you hear me? - I hear. - You are on the island, Penny. You are on Snape Island. Do you hear me, Penny? You are on the island with Mae, and Des, and Gary. - Mae, and Des, and Gary. [creepy laughing] [creepy giggling] [creepy giggling] [moaning softly] - Gary? Penny, are you there? [creepy giggling] [door creaking] Gary? Penny? [door smacking] Where are you? Stop screwing around, will ya? You'll scare the shit outta Mae. [creepy giggling] That you, Gary? Come on, Gary, where the hell are you? [door creaking] Stop playing around, man. Jesus Christ! [thudding] [screaming] [ominous music] [creepy giggling] [ominous music] [door creaking] [suspenseful music] [screaming] - Did you hear that? - What? - I don't know. I thought I heard something. - Can't hear anything. Maybe it was a seal or a bird. - Oh, come on. Let's get back, I'm getting cold. [ominous music] [growling] [screaming] [ominous music] [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] Kill! Blood! Kill, blood! [screaming] [radio distorting] [knocking] - Ah, the return of the wanderer. - Where the hell have you been, Brent? We were just about to come look for you. - Sorry, I was looking around for a cave entrance while there was still light. - Did you find any? - No. - There must be caves under this place. - What about your brother, Hamp? He lived here for 20 years. Did he ever mention a cave? - No. - How did you know his brother lived here? - What do you think I've been doing since I was in England, sunbathing? I spent two days in Portray and 350 in the local pub. I know more about this place than Hamp does. Well, not quite so much. - Hey, Hamp, any cave would have its mouth here on the seaward side. - Yes, you're right. Be hidden at high tide there. - Well, that's not far from the lighthouse. The caves could extend underneath it, couldn't they? - And I bet they do, Adam. Why look at the state of this room. There's been subsidence here. - Yes, you're right. And remember how it's all shored up outside. How long has this place been derelict, Hamp? - Oh, 30 years or more. They moved the lighthouse to Bisley Head, and that was before the war. - Bisley Head? Yes, there it is. That's not as good a position for the lighthouse as this island, and the only reason they would've moved it is because this place is unsafe. - Because of the subsidence, caused by the caves? - And you've never heard of any caves under the island, Hamp? - Dinner's ready. - What is it? - Dog food, darling, what else? You should enjoy it. [bowl crashing] - What's the matter? - Can't you hear it? Listen. [distant flute music] - I hear it. [distant flute music] - It's just the wind. [distant flute music] - That's not the wind. Is it? [distant flute music] - It's coming from outside. [shushing] [distant flute music] - Over there! - Adam! I wish they hadn't have left us alone. - We aren't. Brom's still here. Brom, where are you? [distant flute music] - There it is again. [distant flute music] It's almost as though it were in the next room. Nora, do you think... Nora? Where are you? Nora? Nora? [suspenseful music] [screaming] - Turn it off, will ya? You wouldn't think I wanted to rape you? - That wouldn't be so bad, you stupid bastard! You just scared the pants off me. - Did I? That's interesting. While they're off I'll take advantage of it. - I'll let you know when I want that. And what the hell are you doing here anyway? - Getting some paraffin for the lamp. - Oh, the tank holds paraffin, does it? - Yeah. - Well how did you know that? You've been on this island before, haven't you? More than once. - I didn't want that guy Brent to know. - Why not? What have you got to hide? - Nothing, Nora, honest. I just didn't want him to know, that's all. He's fuzz and they're trouble. Unofficial fuzz, true, but I still keep well clear of them. I used to come here when I was a kid with Uncle Hamp. That's how I knew, honest. - We better get out of here before Rose starts screaming the place down. - See anything, Dan? - No, nothing. You could hide an army in these rocks. - Brent, forget it. Let's go back, it's hopeless. - Aye, I told you it was the wind. - [Dan] Yes, or someone was playing a flute. - I'll warm the food up. - Not for me, darling. This'll keep me warm for the rest of the night. - Did you find anything? - No, no, nothing. I need a drink. - Where did you score the grass? - I brought it with me of course. You want to turn on? - No, thanks. I've got feeling we'll have to keep it together tonight. So there's someone else on the island. - Who? Somebody looking for the same thing that we are? - The treasure. Why bother to keep themselves outside on a night like this? - And how did they get here? I didn't see a boat when we came in. Did you, Brom? Hamp? But why play a flute? - Whoever it was would have to be mad. Mad. What am I saying? - I think you struck on it, Nora. Whoever killed those three American kids must be mad. Now the police think Penny did it. I don't. I think somebody else brutally murdered those people and subjected Penny to such horrors that her mind couldn't take it. I think that person is on this island tonight, out there in the rocks, or under here in the caves. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna have a look at the boat. Make sure none of the lines have loosened. - Don't you think you've had enough? That's your third. - Who is counting? Help me get some music on this thing. - No don't, Nora, leave it alone. It's our only means of communication with the mainland. What do you know of Brent, Dan? - Same as you. I met him for the first time in Laurence's office, like you. - I wonder if Laurence checked his credentials. - Why? - I don't trust him, that's all. He keeps on disappearing. He's obviously been on the island before. - And he carries a gun. - How do you know that? - I noticed the bulge in his trousers under his sweater. - Yes, you would. I'm going to go help Brent with the boat. - I'll go with you then. - Three is company. We'll see whether the boat was Brent's real reason for going out. - Better you stay here, Brom. [cup crunching] [cup crunching] - Well, I think I'll go to bed. Brom, do you think you could escort me to the bedroom, protect me from things that go bang in the night? - What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation? - Hmm. You look like a big, strong boy, do you think you can manage this on your own? [zipping] [laughs] Zip me, baby. Zip me! [suspenseful music] - Brent! Where is he? We didn't pass him. - Well he must've gone off somewhere. I hope nothing happens to him. - Well why should it? - Because this is a dangerous island, Mr. Winthrop. [yelling] [suspenseful music] - Ooh. [moaning] [suspenseful music] - What was that? - What was what? - Did you see anything? - See what? - I thought I saw something move out there in the rocks. - [snickers] You're imagination is playing tricks on you. - I coulda sworn. [moaning] [suspenseful music] [moaning] [loud explosion] - The boat! [fire crackling] [door slamming] [door creaking] [clattering] - Rose? [lightly snickering] [creaking] [creaking] [screaming] - It's Nora! [panting] [door shutting] - My god, the stench. - Nora. [ominous music] - Oh, God, forgive us. [ominous music] - Hamp, help me get this outside. Come on! [ominous music] - Did you see that thing? Did you see it? - I'll get you some water. - Mr. Winthrop! - Damn! Adam, this means we're completely cut off from the mainland. The boat's gone, now the radio's gone. - But who did it, Dan? Who brought the body in here and smashed the radio? - Hamp, will be able to tell us that. Won't you, Hamp? - How should I know? - Look, I'm tired of pussyfooting around with you. Let's have the truth for a change. That was Martha, your dead brother's wife, right? - Yes. - Right. But how could that be if what you told us earlier was true? You said they both drowned, but Martha didn't drown. Any first year medical student could tell at a glance her neck was broken. And if she was lost at sea, how did she get here in this room? They've told us a pack of lies. - Well, Brom, you know it? Yes, it was all a pack a lies. It's as I said just now... that were Martha, God rest her poor, tormented soul. - When did she die? - Six months ago, we think. - You mean you don't know? - No. I used to bring Saul and Martha supplies out by boat every month. She'd look out for me, meet me on the jetty and take the food. Then one day six months ago she wasn't there. So I landed. There were no sign of her or Saul. - But what made you think she was dead? She might've gone to the mainland with her husband. - She'd never leave here. - Why not? - Why did they come to this island in the first place, Mr. Gurney? A young married couple with a newborn baby. What brought them to live here? - Saul went mad. He'd always been a strange one, that Saul. But he seemed to get better after he married Martha. Then after the baby were born he went to pieces. They used to live in a cottage then out on the cliffs on the mainland. Lonely place it were. One day, soon after the baby were born, Martha came to see my dad and said she was going to bring Saul and the baby out here to Snape Isle. Well, my dad agreed and brought them out here on the boat and thereafter he paid for all the food and and supplies they needed. - Do you think Saul killed her? - I woulda sworn he woulda never have harmed Martha. He loved her in his own lost sorta way. - That day you came out here with your father, it was to look for Saul? - Yeah. - Hamp, do you think it was Saul that killed those kids? - No, Saul were my flesh and blood and he were mad but he wouldn't harm anyone. Of that I'm sure. Anyhow, how do we know that he's still alive? - Well, he's not above the island, that's for sure. Because if he was the police would have found him when they searched after the deaths. So he must be under it, Hamp, mustn't he? In the caves. - Yeah, that's what I reckon, Mr. Winthrop. But I don't know anything about any caves, Mr. Masters, and that's the truth. I never set foot on the island after Saul came to live here with Martha and the baby. - And why not? You said you brought them food once a month. - Martha wouldn't have it. I never saw Saul after he came here. Never saw him nor the baby, just Martha on the key. And one day I asked her about Michael, that were her boy, and she said that he were dead. - Well it doesn't give you much of a feeling of security, does it? Knowing a mad man may be roaming around under your feet There must be an entrance to the cave somewhere near this building. Now whoever put Martha's body in here couldn't possibly have come from the direction of the jetty or we'd have seen them on our way there. - They must've come from the side. - Yeah, you're right. Well, there's one way to find out. Let's go and look. I want you girls to stay here. - Unarmed, you must kidding? - Just lock the door and whatever you do don't go outside. We won't go out of earshot so that if anything happens just scream. - Can't we come, Adam? - No, you'll be safer in here than out there in the dark. Hamp, Brom, you take that side. Dan and I will look over there. Signal if you find an opening. - What are you thinking about, Rose? - Martha. I wonder why she came here to live, severing all connections with her friends and relatives. - She must have really loved that poor, demented man. - Do you think Saul killed her? - Oh, who's to know? She probably slipped, fell on the rocks. - And he was left here all alone on this dreadful island, watching her body rot away and not being able to comprehend what was happening down in those dark caves. - Well don't feel so sorry for him, Rose. Probably killed those poor kids, remember. Oh, I'm tired. I really think I'll go and get some sleep. Are you coming? - No, I'll stay here. I couldn't sleep anyway. - Ah, this is crazy, Hamp. There's no way we're gonna find a way in. [yelling] Hamp! Hey, we found an entrance to those caves. Shall I signal the others? [thudding] Shall I go get the others? - No, no! We'll go down there alone. It's a tight squeeze but we'll make it. - Oh, no. I don't fancy that, Hamp. Not with that nut Saul running around loose. Brave bravery ain't my bag, man. - He won't hurt you. - You tell those American kids that? - It's family, Brom. - Screw you! Family! Have you ruined your marbles too? I aint going down that hole for no family reasons! - Then how about money? Lots of it. - Keep talking. - There's gold in those caves. The treasure those museum people are looking for is down there. And Saul knows where it is. - You talked me into it. - Come on then. [moaning] [sobbing] [door creaking] [sobbing] [sobbing] [ominous music] [sobbing] [metal clanging] [door creaking] [footsteps crunching] [ominous music] [door creaking] [ominous music] [screaming] [mumbling] [screaming] [metal clanging] [screaming] [mumbling] [screaming] [mumbling] - Martha. - Nora! [ominous music] - Ah, this place is like a rabbit warren. - I'm sure we passed this junction before. - They all look alike to me. Once you've seen one cave you've seen them all. - Come on, let's try this way. - There's no one up there. [lid clattering] - What are you doing? - Do you remember that hole we saw in the rocks? I think it opens out into the caves. I'm gonna blast it wide enough for us to get into. - You're not leaving me here alone. - Of course not. Grab your coat. Come on, Dan. - Ah, this is hopeless. - We'll be here a week at this rate. We'll have to split up. - Split up? I don't think that's a good idea, Hamp. - Now you shut, you yellow bastard, you. I'll take that tunnel. You go along that one. Now if you come to a junction, make a mark on the inside of the tunnel. Okay? - But, Hamp, we ought to... stick together. [ominous music] [ominous music] [flute music] [loud explosion] [water spraying] - That's done it. [water spraying]
