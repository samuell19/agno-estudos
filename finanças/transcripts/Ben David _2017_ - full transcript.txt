Turn around. This is him. Good job, guys. Hi Problem solved. We caught him. - Congratulations, Salman. And come by my office when you get back. I need to talk to you. What is it? You can tell me now. Okay. I'm moving you to the Jewish Department. What do you mean Jewish Department? What you heard, Salman. You're moving to the Jewish department and they have assignments for you. Are you serious?! I let you know that thanks to a my source, the most wanted fugitive has been captured, and you tell me that I'm being transferred?! It's not me. It’s from higher up. They are focusing efforts on Price Tag attacks. They are moving many allocations. Oh, so I'm an allocation now?! All my training in terror and Arabic goes to waste so I can chase some children vandals?! C'mon! - Eran, calm down! You know the field, you read interrogation reports, you're aware that Price Tag actions lead to terror attacks. It's equally as important. So now I’m Eran? I liked my Arabic name... You are now David. And that’s that. You can begin with stuping the area and the people. Yes, I know them, that's the problem... You will be okay They chose you for a reason. Ramy, you need to understand... I'd rather eat hummus in Balata than in these hills. Eran! Stop it! Grow up. What is it? Birds? Goldfinches. A protected Bird. Looks like hunters from the village left them when our troops got there, I'll handle it. Oh! Right on time. Eran, meet Karen, the officer you are going to work with. Karen, Eran Harel. E have a first target for recruitment and the urgency is very high. I suggest you take a look and start right when you're ready. So it's final? Yes, it's final. Can you give us a minute? You don't have clearance for this material. You’re absolutely right, Jews are not my business. Good luck, Eran. We trust you. Okay. So this is Your first target, Yehudah Herman, 17 years old, originally from Ra'anana. Dropped out of school due to ADHD, but he is a very intelligent kid. He was suspected of property offenses against Palestinians, but the most important thing, is his access to major Price Tag activists. Okay, Karen, it's not... You don’t really get it. I know these people, I know this area, I was there. I was discharged before the disengagement, just before the evacuation, I was there, in Gush Katif, I've been these people, I know them. There were rumors of an Shin Bet collaborator among us, and one night before the troops entered, I was awakened by 3 hilltop boys in the night, got me out of the sleeping bag and beat me up. What is it, parrots? Goldfinches. Goldfinches, like thistles? (cognates in Hebrew) Yeah... The goldfinch feeds its chicks with seeds of brambles. My wife... Right, we have a lot of work ahead of us. Yehudah Herman. - Yes. Good luck. Hi, mom, what's up? Thank God... Hope for the best. How's Reut? Not so good... The disease is getting worse. There is a treatment that might help her, but I don't know how we'll get the money for it... What about you, sweetie? How are you? I’m okay, thank God. I'm with the goats. - Great... I need you to come watch her in the hospital next week. We got no one available for Okay, I'll come. - Thanks sweetie. Perhaps you can drop by home later, take some food to the hilltop? We’ll see... I talked with the counselor of your school. They agreed to let you do the finals exams, even though you were not in school. Come on, mom, leave it alone... Too bad... Take care of yourself out there? Mom... It's not like they say in the media. T’s calm here. Okay then. We'll talk. Goodbye. - Bye. What is it, mom? - Hello, Yehuda? This is David from the Ministry of Defence speaking. You came up as someone who can help us in several areas, and I would like to offer you an interesting job. Ministry of Defense? Yes, I suggest we meet and talk, and then you'll know much more. Listen, I... I don't know how found me and what you want... - You have nothing to worry about. Me talking to you speaks volumes of you, really think that if you come meet and listen, you will not regret it. Listen up, I don't know what you want from me, but if it's what I think, I'm really not interested. Don't call me anymore. Good bye. Look, Yehudah, I brought food and goats milk of the holy land straight from the udder! Let's start the week with a gourmet breakfast. Lovely. Thanks. Wasn't this Sabbath amazing -Yeah. How are you? You've been quiet lately. Normal, thank God. Content with what I have. God bless you, righteous man. I remember when I first came to the hills, how I miss those days... Praying at five in the morning, guarding all through the freezing night... What a passion I had. Yeah, I love this place. Want some? Look Yehudah, it's fine if it’s difficult for you. Living here is a sacrifice. That's life, our old parents gave up fighting for the land. Now it’s our turn to fight. Bring it, bring it over here. That’s There. - Thanks. Fine, let me have some. Hello. I have to give treatment now, I'm sorry. Please wait outside for a few minutes. Psalm 130? Yes, my sister... She's very sick. What's her name? And the mother's? I manage a synagogue, I'll pray for her. Ruet daughter of Rina. Thank you. 'm Davie. E talked on the phone. Is this a costume or are you really religious? - It’s not a costume. My job is to take care of things important to us both, to guard the land of Israel. Guard the land of Israel... As if you're guarding it. Do you want to enlist to the army? I was a commander in the Golani reconnaissance platoon. Can help you get anywhere you want. Right now with all the records on you, at most you'll be a pencil pusher in Tel Aviv. The role of the IDF is to protect Israeli civilians not to harm them. Correct? The way things are, I really don't think I'll enlist. You're a clever guy. You probably know that serving in the army is a mitzvah from the Torah. So you are a yeshiva student now? Well done. You’re great army would not be here if we weren't up on the hills. This army is also yours, and it watches over you. The Almighty watches over me. And over you too. And even if you're right, I'd prefer returning to the era of resistance movements. IDF will be the "Haganah", and we'll be the "Irgun" and the "Lehi". One enemy, a division of labor. That was possible before the establishment of state, You can't do that these days. Now you need to defend the country within the law. Whose work do you think it makes more difficult? Just because of these things people hate us. Us? What do you and I have in common? You are a lackey of the seculars. The secular state died in the Gush Katif disengagement. Now it's time for the Messiah son of David. Yehudah! I'm here for you, bro. I'm here for you. You want to help your sister? Know the best doctor in the field. Just think about Hi. - Hi! What’s up? THow are you? Okay, why^did we set to meet here? It’s Just someone from work I visited, his sister is sick. Wanna get something to eat? Yes, I'm starving. - Let's go. Hey there! Allahu Akbar! Ouch! Are you Okay? - What’s wrong with you?! What happened? This idiot doesn’t know how to fight! - I'm Sorry. Pay attention to what you're doing okay? - Okay. Yehudah... - Okay, it won’t happen again. Let’s continue. Hurry up! Stones! Stones! Get them back! Yehudah... Yehudah! Where are you going?! - I don't know, I have a bad feeling this time... What feeling?! If we don't fight back they'll kill us! Okay, I'll come back in a little bit... Yehuda! Yehuda, where are you going?! Where are you going?! Chicken! Coward! Yehuda! Let go of me! Help! Reserve the right to remain silent. That's cute. Is this from the ‘Honenu’ advice booklet? Listen, kid, no more games. Enough. I have a restraining order from Judea and Samaria ready for you. Along with a house arrest warrant for you at your mother's in Raanana. Have you ever heard of the bald eagle? The symbol of the United States. You know what it does? It helps engineers find cracks and holes in gas pipes. When fuel is leaking, to vultures it smells just like a carcass, and they all gather there, and you can tell where there is a leaking pipe. Do you understand? We also have methods. You can't evade the law. Do you know what the best part is? That is no limit to the warrants I can get for you. A restraining order from the hospital your sister is at? You got it. Administrative detention... - What do you want? A little help. Small things. I don't know, perhaps names. And you will let me go back to the hill? If from now on, we understand each other? Then yes. But don’t involve my sister. You have my word. And if anyone asks, you kept silent and we let you out for lack of evidence. Okay? "Source: Ben David" Eran... Yeah? Let me drive. You don’t have a driving license. - So what? It’s an open area. Yehudah. Come on, man. You are not driving without a license! - Who's gonna know? So help me learn. How can I help you?! C'mon. Well, I'll give you another name Let's have David Levy (former government minister). You got it. - Okay. Come on, man! Okay. Yeah? - Yes. You’re the man! Really? Yes. - Let's go. David Levy... Right? You said to do that and then move? I’m pressing here... - But you forgot the pinky, bro. Look at him, what’s up? There was an attack! - Where? On the Trans-Samaria road, a police car was shot. Really? Hananel got injured. What was Hananel doing in a police car? Did he get arrested? Have you heard about the attack in Trans-Samaria? No, my beeper is broken. What happened? Shots on a police car from a passing vehicle. Our target was probably injured on the way to the station. Shit. I gotta go. - What? Ben David is in danger. - Do you have security guards for the drive? I don't know. I don't have time to organize Isn't it against the regulations? - I couldn't care less right now, I'm going. Locate his positioning and call me, okay? Karen. - Okay. What's up? Any news on Ben David? Yes, he took his cellphone battery out near Burqin. Shit... That's not good.. Think something happened? Should we call the army? No, no, I got it. What are you going to do? I know people. - Okay... Take care. Don't worry. - Okay. Bye God dammit! "A crazy Jewish boy is on his way to you, catch him but don't kill him. Thank you." Settler! Get him over here! Come here! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Let go of him! Let go! Let go or I'll shoot! - It’s captain Salman! Get in to the car. Don't want to. This is the thanks I get after saving your life? Saved? You ruined my life! It's my fault Hananel got killed. Yehudah, I'm on your side. I went to yeshiva high school with Hananel’s brother. And no one is going to know what you did here tonight I don't believe you. I don't believe you anymore. - Tell me, have I ever lied to you? You'll screw me over. - I won’t screw you over. Yes, you will, and if you do, I'll get to your wife and your little girl! Nazi. Stay in the car. Yes? - Hi, Eran. It's Ramy. Can you talk? - Yes, yes. In short, I’m sure you missed speaking Arabic, so I have good news for you. You're coming back to us, Salman. I'm not going back. - What?! Do you know what I did to make that happen? I'm not going, I’m staying in the Jewish Department. There's plenty of work here. Eran, if you don't come back now, there will not be another opportunity. Ramy, are you listening to me? Can't go... Eran? Eran? Hello!
