How long are you going to keep me cooped up in this place? He got two of your idiots while we twiddled our thumbs. You should have let me handle it. Then I'll let you go next. I will set the stage. Entertain him with what you do best. You can be reasoned with. I hope you're as reasonable with my reward. Are you going to make him go alone, sir? Hardly. The audience gets more pleasure from a drama with a twist. The more tragic the tragedy, the greater the emotional effect. It's been two whole weeks now... This is as far as we can travel together. Why? Your job or your life... ... which is more important? I won't say why. If I did, you would be drawn into it. Well, it's been fun! But this is it. I wonder how Mr. Vash is doing? You know him! He's undoubtedly goofing around in some town! Hey, did you hear? Remember the guy in the white coat who caused the saloon riot? It looks like he's one of Vash's men. Aha! That explains why his methods were so vicious! But he took off. Yeah! We should count our blessings that we got off so easy! He's a devil in a red coat. Damn. I wish he'd drop dead! How can you say that about him?! You don't even know what kind of a person he is! Ma'am...? Walk your own path with your head held high... - Milly? - Yes, ma'am? Stop wasting time here, we have work to do! Yes, ma'am! We will follow him to the ends of the earth! For that is what we must do! Hello, chair! How ya been? Legato... ...this time it's my turn to hunt you. I will find you, whatever it takes. Yeah, right! It sounded real cool in my head... ...but I haven't got a clue how I'm going to find him. Not only that, the more I think about it, the more frightening it becomes... ...and now my legs are starting to knock together! Good God, I have to fight HIM!!! Will I survive a fight with a guy who makes those evil eyes when he smiles?! No, I'm gonna be slaughtered, that's what! It's not funny!! I should back away from it. That's what I should do. Yeah, yeah! For once, that is an excellent idea. You're the one who isn't funny! What are ya, a radio?! Life is meant to be fun, right? That's super-tasty! Hey, mister! I'll have another salmon sandwich! A... Augusta... I'll be waiting for you in Augusta City. You will acknowledge my request. If you do not, this is what will happen. Stop!! Who did this?! There's no blood! Huh? What? You know him?! Do you know this guy? He's the only one capable of this! What is it? Huh? Legato! You called him? He your friend? Hey, is he your friend? Do you want me there so badly, you would kill an innocent? All right, I'll go there, Legato. I'll go to your home ground. Who are you? Who the heck are you?! Hey, where's the fire? L-Listen! He's here!! It's Vash the Stampede!! Are you sure? Yeah! He's running rampant through Augusta, shooting off his silver gun! That crazy bastard is going to do to Augusta what he did to July! It's a good thing we found him! What is he thinking? MY NAME IS... ...VASH THE STAMPEDE!!! Forgive the lack of warning, but it's time for my daily massacre! If you do not believe I am the real thing... ...take a good look at me and start freaking!! Observe my red coat, lovely blond locks... ...and my 100% accurate gunmanship! Anyway, if you don't wanna die, get 100 iles away from this place... ...and live happily ever after!! That's the last of them. Why couldn't that nihilist have picked a better location?! I used up all my energy just chasing people out. I'm pooped. I don't like this. It reminds me of the other time. What? Blood?! Do you like our little decorations? Losers don't get to go home. They go to Hell. Did you kill them? I am the fifth Gung-Ho Gun. My name is E. G. Mine! Did you kill them?! Damn, you're noisy... What if I did, chickenshit? You don't seem to want to kill anyone, so someone had to cover your ass! And besides... ...you've already fallen into my court. I've never heard such a rotten script. So, I have only two choices: To die or let others die? Don't be so huffy! Only one more has to die. After I take you down... ...it'll all be over! What? What's the idea?! That bastard is trying to cut in on my action! Had I kept my blade sheathed, you would have been knocked senseless... ...by your Humanoid Typhoon there. Say what?! It looks like you're the favorite. What's your name? Forgive my lack of manners. I am the ninth Gung-Ho Gun... ...Rai-Dei the Blade of the Jigenzan-Itto School! I hold no personal grudge against you, but I wish to engage you in a Shi-Ai. A Shi-Ai? - DEATH MATCH- I can't read that. If you cannot read Japanese, then I will explain. Fight me to the death! Are you playing along with his farce as well? I would happily walk the path of carnage for the mastery of Bushi-Do. What? I refer to what is only visible from the edge of the deathly abyss. I know you have seen it. There's nothing to see there. Only fear. Even so, I also wish to experience that mental state! Come on, now... It's my job to dice this guy! Laughable! It would appear you didn't hear what I told you earlier. You're right, I didn't. Your match was already over. His gunmanship! Words fail to describe its greatness! That man was never an opponent to be humbled by you. Although I think you may have served to amuse him. Why, you... The angry aura released through your every pore...! My knees are quaking with excitement! This alone makes my journey worthwhile. This is my dearest pleasure! Come on. I am in your debt. Get ready! Give me a real fight! Ever hear of a warrior's compassion? I can't shoot to kill you. That arrogance is an eyesore! It blurs the path to spiritual awareness! People don't change their ways so easily. People? Ridiculous! You and I are men, yet not of man. We are dark, diabolical puppets! We are demons!! What is that?! This isn't a good thing! Do you think it's Vash? Let's move, Milly! - Ma'am! - What are you doing?! We can't! It's too big for us to handle! It's super-dangerous! I am well aware of the danger! Ma'am!! I told you I want a real fight! That's some shock wave! But it's nothing I can't dodge. Your bullets are flying wide! You mollycoddle!! Compassion, in the heat of battle?! This is a gross disappointment. Is this all there is to Vash the Stampede? It isn't enough. I don't see anything! At least... At the very least, I want an answer! At this moment, what can you see? Tell me! Do you intend to die, Vash the Stampede? It's time to use it. Wh... Use it. Use it. It's something only you can do. Use it! Quickly!! No! Stop it!! STOP IT!!! I cannot believe he is begging for his life! What is this?! This light... This light! Oh, my god... Mr. Vash meant what he said! Just look at this place! Where is he? Where is he?! Meryl, where are you going?! Let go of me! Let go of me, Milly!! Put me down! Milly! I want to go there!! I have to go there!! What is this phenomenon? Is this some sort of Christian magic?! STOP IT!!! What is this indescribable horror coursing through my entire body?! Is this it, the moment I have been seeking? Will I finally achieve spiritual awareness? No! This thing before me... RUN!!! Run!!! What is that?! What the hell is that?! Don't! Stop it!! Please stop it!!! What's that? What is that horrific light?! Did he create that? That's right. This is his second time including July 23 years ago. Milly, please! Let me go!! I can't do that! If you die, you'll never see him again! Ma'am, look!! A hole in the moon... The terror... Only you could survive something like that. Y-You. What happened to Vash the Stampede? - I don't know. - Darn. If we act now, we may be able to defeat that man... ...that devil of a man. He is too dangerous to be left alive. Come, help me to... I can't do that. Are you insane?! You and I are... Sorry. Sure, nobody died... but look at this terrible landscape. Is this the path you have chosen? Is it, Vash the Stampede? Hey, did you hear how The Humanoid Typhoon showed up in Augusta? I sure did. They say he managed to destroy the entire city by himself! First July, and now Augusta! What the hell is that maniac thinking?! The bounty on his head will only get bigger! I'm ready to believe it's his fault we're stuck on this planet... ...along with all the other crap I've heard about him. But there's more. They say he's also responsible for the hole in the moon! One man could never pull off a stunt like that! Chill out! I'm just telling you what I heard! Maybe we should be thankful we're still alive. Yeah. You said it. Ma'am, we got a letter from the main office. It's finally here... Their correspondence certainly is slow. We've been waiting for two weeks! " Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson... ...are to return to the main office." " Furthermore, in a conference held the other day, it was decided... ...that Vash the Stampede be designated as mankind's first human Act of God." " Henceforward, no matter what kind of damage he causes... ...The Bernardelli Insurance Society will be... ...will be... ...uninvolved." This can't be. This can't be... ...what do they think will change by making this decision now? Ma'am... Mr. Vash, you stupid jerk... You made her cry! I'll never, ever forgive you for this!
