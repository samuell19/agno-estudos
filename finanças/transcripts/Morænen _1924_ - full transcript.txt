Play in 6 acts by Laurids Skands Directed by: Wilhelm Sandberg Cinematography: Louis Larsen Christen Jørgensen In the far away North, bounded by the gloomy, rocky Moraine, the first of the Brekanæs had settled. It must have been a gloomy heart that built a house so much in tune with its surroundings. As hard and inflexible as his forefathers, the bailiff, Thor Brekanæs, is a fitting occupant for the house on the Moraine. (Peter Nielsen) - Glowing sun, I hate you. Set damn sun and let the darkness come. Night is my only friend. And she, his wife, who has brought into the world a child, not his own, dreads the night and the darkness. - Another night of eternal darkness, and ceaseless echo of his footsteps. Mother! My poor little Vasil, poor little Vasil! May God lay his hand over my little innocent boy! - So you have taught the brat to call me "father". This cuckoo cub that you threw in my nest! - I just want to be allowed to go! The river is deep, and not far away... I'll show you the way once you give birth to my child, not before! - I was forced to marry you. I have never loved you as I don't love these mountains! - I gave you what I value above everything, my name! - The sin is mine. No one shall know that Vasil is not your son. I know my way! The shroud of night enfolded the desolate valley, where the Brekanæs house lies, full of gloomy memories of life-hating men and life-loving women. That night Gunhild Brekanæs prepares for her last journey. - Forgive me, Father in Heaven, You who know everything. Forgive me, because I'm taking away Vasil from this cold world, that knows no mercy! - He was born in sin, and he shall not be your burden. I will carry him into Paradise, pure and guiltless! - You know it, you'll leave once you'll give birth to the son you carry beneath your heart. I told you, not before! - Give me Vasil. He is mine - mine! He is the proof of my disgrace, and I must take him with me. He carries my name! - If you take vengeance on my innocent child, who has done nothing to you, the day will come when he will return evil for evil! - If you'd just tell me now, that you forgive me, that you understand me... If you do it now, I will love you forever! - I do not forgive, I am a Brekanæs... - ... and I tell you, I shall bring up your innocent child as a Brekanæs too, and will teach him to despise the woman who became his mother! In the night a son was born, Aslak Brekanæs - and when the first rays of the morning sun shone over the deep waters of the fjord, they managed to kiss the rings, which for a few seconds, testified to where his mother had found the rest she longed for. After 25 short summers and 25 long winters... And during this time, Thor Brekanæs continued to think of his wife, only as a sinner. His pain and hate have strengthened, but he believes in God. - In the name of Jesus we thank you, God, for our daily bread... - Good... That is right... God first, and then father! But it is he who sees God. It is Aslak, Thor's son. (Peter Malberg) The terrors that clouded his birth, are reflected in his pitiful existence... - I have talked to God in the church. when I heard the music of his beautiful organ! Her name was Thora, and she was Thor's goddaughter, an orphaned girl whom he had adopted. (Karina Bell) Swein Gudmundson, son of the day laborer Gudmund. Now he is an assistant to the bailiff and he is in love with Thora. (Sigurd Langberg) - I am certain that I am not going to live very much longer. And that is good! - I want to see you married to Thora, before I die! - She is a girl of dreams and idylls, but you must make her forget them. Speak to her now! - Your father wants us to marry soon, Thora! - I'm so young, Swein Gudmundson. - We have been going about together for nearly a year, and you have never allowed me to kiss you! - I am so young... - I shall never love you, but perhaps one day I shall hate you. It's up to you! - Poor boy, my poor boy. You are happy in your madness. You are her revenge! And outside the house of gloom, Thora's home... - I am sorry, Thora... I never meant to hurt you! - You used to be so happy... I shall go away from here... Then you can be happy again! I LOVE YOU Poems of love and life by Vasil Brekanæs FOR MY MOTHER! Everything can die and vanish, disappear and fade away, but in a child's memory the mother lives on. I will never be able to forget, even now that I'm an adult, the times I could hear a carillon play in your heart. I've felt all your joy and pain, my dear mummy; the blood of your heart has become the blood of the child. Like the redness of the sky after the sun has set, - dear mummy! - your picture will always be with me. - It's like stabbing me in the chest! His mother is having her revenge! Swein's father, Gudmund, tenant farmer at Brekanæs. (Charles Wilken) He has been a faithful servant to the Brekanæs', and the autumn of his life was centered upon his Bible and his son... - This is my home, this is my place. I should have been a herdsman like you! - I love Thora, but I should free her. It's all the bailiff's fault! I could kill him! He sits for some time with that letter in his hands, he hesitates to open it, as he knows it is Vasil's letter. Dear Father! I want to ask your forgiveness. I am giving up my Law studies, in order to write books. I have obtained a bursary, and I am leaving for home today. Your son, Vasil. On the following morning, the coasting steamer arrived, with Vasil Brekanæs on board. It's been three years since Vasil Brekanæs last saw these mountains, this fjord. (Emanuel Gregers) He would have preferred to have told Vasil everything and then turn him down, but people would have known, and he would be associated with a scandal... - Why Thora - how you have grown, and how beautiful you are! - But that's no reason not to say good morning! - I'm so glad you have come home. Everything is so gloomy and oppressive here, everyone here... dig themselves down! - Thora, how is it possible that such a flower could bloom in a place like this? - No one has ever spoken to me like that before... - Are those flowers for me? - My dear little Thora... - Don't kiss me, Vasil! - Your father has made me promise to marry Swein Gudmundson! I was never allowed to write it to you! - Do you like him? - Don't worry, Thora.... I won't allow you to marry Swein Gudmundson! - Thora - I don't advise you to go to Brekanaes with - him! - I feel sorry for you, Swein Gudmundson, but I won't allow Thora to be buried alive here with you! It would be a cruelty - for both of you. Two brothers. Why - Thora's ring disappeared, and he never found it. - Wait here... Bailiff's orders... - It's... Vasil. - Vasil, my dear Vasil, it hurts me to have to treat you like a stranger in your own home - Father! - You have come uninvited! - What do you want here at Brekanæs'? - Did you receive my letter? - It did cost me a great deal of money to make you study to become a lawyer! - You have forced me to study Law, but I won't allow myself to be forced any more. - In the future, I shall go my own way. I feel no obligation. - No obligation, no, you are a true son of your mother! - I don't remember my mother, but I never felt that I had a father! - He pulled out the ring from Thora's finger. He took her away from me! - You may go, wait until I call you! - Don't touch it... - Your father has forbidden it! And while Thora tells Vasil all that has happened at Brekanæs'... - Why didn't you knock him down? I will probably strike... and I'll break the curse that lies and weighs on the Brekanæs. - There's father. He's going down to the Morain! - People say it's haunting. I've even heard some screams from down there... - But now I know it's daddy that goes down there at night! - One evening when I thought the whole house was asleep, I heard screams coming from the Moraine and then I heard someone opening the front door... - I followed Aslak down to the Moraine... - If only I could discover who has brought this dishonour upon me - Oh, if I only knew! - We will break this curse! Won't you play to me, Thora? - I am so unused to being happy, that I almost think I sin when I laugh! He does not know that this is the song his mother used to play when she carried him under her heart... ...but those sounds managed somehow to touch the strings of his soul and to chase the darkness from his spirit. - What do you want here? - I will save Thora and Aslak from you! - I will take them with me out of this hell. - And as I smash this harp, that can only sing about lies, so I will smash you! - Don't cry, Thora... Your life, your happiness, I won't allow him to destroy them. Towards evening... the atmosphere at Brekanæs House is like the threatening calm before a storm. - The bailiff wishes to speak to Mr. Vasil! - It is my will that you remain here and complete your legal studies with Swein Gudmundson! - I hate Law, and will never be a lawyer! - Then you must leave this house tonight, and at the next court session I will proclaim that you are no longer my son! - I gladly leave this house, this living tomb, but I will take Thora with me! - I called for the minister today. He will read the banns for Thora and Swein on Sunday! - I hope to read something more amusing - on your grave! - I have broken with Father. He destroyed my mother's life, and now he wants to destroy ours as well, but enough now! - I told him I should take you with me! - What did the bailiff say? - We still haven't had our last word! - I just wanted to tell you, Mr. Bailiff, that on Sunday Thora and I won't have the banns read! - I'm not going to make her unhappy! - You and Thora will inherit Brekanæs House when I die! And you'll have to be good to Aslak. This is what I want! - I'm not the right man for Thora. I am the son of a labourer, and I wish I had been a labourer myself. I'll no longer be your slave! - Is this how you thank me for dragging you out of the gutter? - I know I've fallen very low, but not low enough to shake Thor Brekanæs' hand! - The two of us are not done with each other! Just like every time he is upset, Thor goes to the moraine there, in the cemetery of his memories, he can cry out all his pain and hate. His thoughts are of Thora... and he realizes that she means everything to him, that she is more than a foster sister... - It has come so far that I wish my father's death... for Thora's sake! Half an hour later, Vasil is on his way up to the farm. - Your father wants to speak to you. He's down at the moraine. A few minutes pass by, and then... - A scream from the Moraine! Did you hear? - Father is lying in the Moraine - murdered! - If the bailiff is dead, then I am in authority. You must come with me! For a very long time old Gudmund has also been a prison guard, but it's been years since he last used the cell keys... And now, Swein sends for the bailiff's soulless body... And for the last time he enters the old farm... Thor Brekanæs, the bitter man, bereft of life. - Thora, the bailiff is dead! - They killed him tonight... in the Moraine! She understands nothing... nothing. But she hears distinctly the working of a loom... - Don't disturb me Thora. I am weaving clothes for father. He is cold. That same night, the nearest Judge is sent for... That night, desperate and shocked, Thora watches over the Bailiff on his deathbed until dawn - unaware of what happened to Vasil... The judge. (A. G. Osmund) - Where is Vasil? - He is under arrest... on suspicion of murder! - Go Swein, go! The hated name still sounded in his ear as the trial began... The stone that killed. - You are accused of the murder of your father, the bailiff Thor Brekanæs. Do you plead guilty? - No! - Will you give your testimony, Gudmundson? - I heard Vasil and the bailiff quarrel, and then I heard Vasil saying: "I hope to read something more amusing on your grave"! - In the evening I met the bailiff in the Moraine. He asked me to send Vasil to him... - Swein Gudmundson, are you prepared to confirm your statement by oath? - You are sitting on father's chair, while he is resting! - And this is father's book, about God. Daddy has cried a lot over that book, and Swein must not touch it! - You can let Swein have the book, God is not in it any more. I shall take it to your father! - Father! - You won't feel cold any more. I've woven a long, long cloak for you tonight. You won't feel cold any more! - Thora must take father's book from the stranger, and Swein shall not touch it! - Swein is downstairs, holding father's book... - They don't want to give it to me. They took it away from me... Through the open window she heard the oath-form, and she understood that now it meant life or death to Vasil... - I lied! - The bailiff was already dead when I saw him in the Moraine... - So you understand, that it is my duty to arrest you! And old Gumlund is called upon to fulfill a heartbreaking task... - Why would you sit behind the bars? - Father's book, about God! - Why are you crying? Why is Vasil in the cell? Why is everything so strange? - You would not understand, Aslak... - I have sent father to sleep, just as the voices told me to! - Did the voices tell you to send father to sleep? - And now I want to throw stones to Swein too... - It was Aslak who did it! - Yes, maybe it was Aslak, who was the culprit, but how can we be sure? ...His mouth may have spoken, but his words don't make sense. - There are many birds and many good stones. There are many voices in the air. - There are a lot of deep beautiful tones... - A lot of deep tones... I must go to them... - If only I could find a way out of this darkness! - Deep tones, he said, deep tones... - It is God himself, who has made Aslak show us the way! - There is one melody that makes Aslak become like other people. - I remember him telling me one evening outside the church... - Dear Thora, I am so miserable. Now I can see myself for what I am. It seemed as if mother came to me through the tones of the organ. And now she is gone again! - You're here, Thora... So many dark shadows in the air... - I think we are justified in opening the church for Aslak, in the service of truth! With the setting of the sun... - The deep tones, they hurt me so, but you must go tell them to come to me. And so my mother will come! - Father in Heaven, forgive me, if what I'm doing for Aslak is a sin... - Please speak to him through the sacred song, and lift the clouds from his soul! - Mother! - Father! A voice told me - it came from the fiord! Daddy, did the stone hit you? - You are bleeding, father! You are bleeding! - Father! I killed you!... I killed you, and the voice in the fjord was crying... - I killed my father...! - Don't cry dear Thora... You played for me, and it was beautiful... The voice from the fjord was mummy's... she's calling me, and I long for her! - It is as if a fountain trickled behind my forehead and I am so tired... - Now father goes to mother... they both smile and they wave to me... (I wished for it so much) And now... the deep tones arrive... - Goodbye, dear Thora... And on the next day, when the sorrowful duties of the two burials were over, Vasil and Thora departed from Brekanæs' house... the farm of shadows and disappointments... They left behind them all the dark and heavy memories, and they were miles away, as the night laid its cloak over the desolate valley up north, at the edges of life. THE END
