Ooh! Tell me, Felice, will it ruin my wave if I wear a helmet this afternoon? A helmet? All God's chillun got wings... ...and I'm one of God's chillun. Maybe I'm only a step-child, but I'm going to get wings. Oh, I know what you mean! Learning to fly. I knew you were doing this. Who told you? There was a little article about it in Town Tattle. You read Town Tattle, Felice? Oh no, I write for it. Hmm? Oh, just odds and ends. Little paragraphs. They have representatives in most beauty salons. Yes? I'm glad you told me. Have you sent in anything about me? Well, I... You have. I can tell. It was you who sent in that squib about my engagement to Bruce Hardy, wasn't it? Well, you see... Well, deny it. It isn't true. There have been conferences, but no papers signed. Unless the depression gets worse, there's no immediate prospect of a merger. Will you send that in? Oh, but most certainly, Miss Owen. As a matter of fact, Mr. Hardy has asthma and wheezes a bit. Oh, don't send that in. It's confidential. Oh, I understand, Miss Owen. Au revoir, Felice. Au revoir, mademoiselle. Oh, Miss Owen. Don't tell me Anatole, you're getting literary too? What are you writing? Well, at the moment, I'm making out bills. Uh-huh. Why haven't you sent me a bill? Oh, well, Miss Owen, I assure you... Let's have it. Give me a blank check, Anatole. Certainly, Miss Owen. Fill in the amount. Oh, and add ten dollars for Felice. Thank you so much, Miss Owen. Martin, you know the Beechhurst Flying School? Yes, Miss Owen, over the Queensboro Bridge. About an hour. Call them on the phone. Yes, miss. Tell them I'll be there in 20 minutes. Yes, miss. Oh, Gilligan. See that cloud up there? Yeah. How far up is it, do you suppose? Oh, a couple thousand feet, I guess. I'm going thru it this afternoon. Yeah? Hmm-mmm. Think you've finished your ground study, huh? Uh-huh. Know all about planes? Hmm-mmm. Well then tell me, what makes 'em tick? I don't want to know what makes them tick. It would spoil the fun. I've been driving a car ever since I was 12 and I've never lifted the hood. And you feel you're ready to go up? Ready? I'm dying to go up. All right. Hey, Eddie. Yeah! Yes? Miss Owen, Mr. Martin. How do? How do you do? Miss Owen's ready to make her first flight this afternoon. Swell. Yeah. You're going to take her up. Oh, swell! Now, Miss Owen, if you'll just go with Eddie. He... Excuse me a minute, will you? Gilligan... If you don't mind, I'd rather not go up with him. Why not? Well... You know, my father was a doctor and before he died he taught me a great deal about diseases. Diseases? Don't look... But sometimes, when he's not aware of it, watch his eyes. What's the matter with his eyes? Haven't you noticed? No. A little yellowish in the corners. Yeah? Hmm-mmm. A touch of epilepsy, dormant perhaps, but liable to break out at any minute. Ordinarily, why I wouldn't have minded, but as this is my first flight, I... Sure! Don't blame you a bit. Hey, Eddie. Yeah? Never mind. Oh. Now, I've got to find someone else. I know. Conway. I'll vouch for him. I've known him for years and he never threw a fit, yet. Hey, Gilligan... Yeah? What was the name of the chap that lectured me the other day on ailerons and channels and control tables? Um... You know, the man with the dark hair and the brown eyes. Oh, look. There he is. Oh, Leonard. We don't waste his time on flying any more. He's more on the technical staff. Oh, you'll make an exception in my favor, won't you? Well, why not, huh? Oh, Jim. Oh, hello, Miss Owen.Hello. Miss Owen's going up today, Jim... ...with you. With me? Yes. By request. I'm superstitious. I think it's a mistake to change instructors. Do you mind? Not at all. Come along. Thanks, Gilligan. Look out for her, Jim. Hey, what's the idea, skipper? Have I got leprosy or something? I don't know, Eddie. You've got a sort of yellowish look in your eyes. Yeah? Yeah! It wouldn't hurt you to see a doctor. Here you are. This the best looking helmet you've got? Well, you're not figuring on having your pictures taken, are you? You don't like to take people up, do you? No, not particularly. It makes me feel like one of those guys at Coney Island. But that's where all the fun is. Well, I'm not in this for the fun of it. That's the trouble with aviation. A lot of people figure a plane's like a roller coaster or something for a thrill. Especially women. Well, aren't women entitled to a thrill? Yes, I'd suppose so. Hop in. Up we go. Watch your head.Okay. Here you are. Thanks. Had your lunch yet? Why, yes. Oh, I'm sorry, but perhaps tomorrow we could have some... The reason I asked is that on your first flight it's better to go up before lunch. You know some people come out of here... Maybe I'm different from some people. You think so? Just forget that I'm a woman and put on a good show for me. You dish it out. I'll take it. Switch-off. Switch-off. Contact. Contact. Okay? Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay? Okay. Good old terra firma. Yeah. The nearer the firma, the less the terra. Next time we go up would you mind doing a little stunting? Huh? Whew! Thanks. Say it's darned nice of you to give me a lift into town. Hop in. Okay? Yeah. Enjoying it? Yeah. Well, here we are. The Lord knows why. We should have been killed half dozen times. But we weren't. Why do you do things like that? Don't tell me you were scared? I certainly was. I still am. There, there, there. I didn't mean to frighten you. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. I will, if you'll let me do the buying. All right. Hey, is this a good speak easy? The best in town. Come on. Hello, everybody. Look, what I've got. I want you to meet my friend and teacher, Mister, er... Leonard. Mr. Leonard. Mrs. Schuyler, Miss Redman, Mr... Oh, never mind, you won't remember the names anyway. I'll tell you what, just call all the men Ike and the women Mike. Oh, Kibbee! Kibbee! Highball for Lindberg. Excuse me. Now, don't run away will you? No, I won't. I'll be right back. Make yourself at home. Oh, my kingdom for a horse. Hey, what's open? Number six is open. I'll take it. On the nose? Right on the nose. Come on, let's go. I'm on six. Please, Linda, please. But why aren't you going to take me with you? I've told you. I can't take you here. But why not? In the first place you're not invited. There are several hundred other reasons, but I'm late now. I'll itemize them for you some other time. All right, daddy, you know best. You can have the car now, Linda. I'll see you at the apartment, after the show. Yes, daddy. Fred, drive me over to Georgie Keeler's place. Hello, Kibbee. Howdy do, sir. Oh, I say I want to play. Come on, you spark plug get the lead out of your hoofs. Hello, Bruce. I just lost my shirt. Well, I'll get you another one. Silk? Better make it sack cloth. By the way, Town Tattleannounced our engagement again. I'm getting tired of denying it. And I'm getting tired waiting for you to admit it. Carol. What? I just came from your bank. Did you buy it? Well, not exactly. They phoned me this morning that you were overdrawn. So I dropped in and took care of it. How much? Oh, what's the difference? You made some money in the market last week. You're all right. No, I'm not all right. I've got to economize. Everybody's economizing. It's a crisis. The newspapers say so. Gee, I wish you'd stop telling me how to spend money and tell me how to save some. I could suggest a plan where you wouldn't have to economize ever. No. I feel like economizing. I'll sell this house. Oh, you'd take a terrific loss. It's practically all you've got left. No, it isn't. I still have Kibbee. That's it. I'll get rid of Kibbee. Oh, Kibbee! Kibbee! Come here. Alley hoop. Come on, uppetyup. Kibbie, get up over there. But Miss Caroline... Come on! Get up here! You don't mean it... Ladies and gentlemen! Hooray! My business manager has just informed me that I've been forced to the wall. I've got to liquidate my assets. I've decided to sell Kibbee! We've had him for 30 years. He's a little second hand, but sound of wind and limb and a bargain at any price. Look at him. Now, you know this is for a very worthy cause. Who'll be the auctioneer? Allow me. I would. All right, Neil, you're elected. Come on. Now folks, what am I offered for this splendid bric-a-brac? A rare old piece. A real antique. An early Tudor model. Guaranteed non-breakable. Non-refillable. But honey, I just got your message. I was lucky to get it at all. Well, you asked for Miss Leonard. You forget my stage name is Lee, Linda Lee. And listen, Jim, the girls aren't supposed to get phone calls in the theatre. You shouldn't call me here. But where the devil will I call you? I tried your rooming house this morning and you weren't there. Well, we've been rehearsing after the show too. What's on your mind? Well, listen kid, I talked to my friend about that job in his office and it's okay. He says it would be better if you knew something about stenography, but you can pick that up quick enough and... But Jim, I don't want a job in any office. I'm all right where I am. Gee, it's lots of fun and the pay's swell. Now be a good boy and go fly your kite. Oh some other time tomorrow or... Oh, Jim. There goes the overture. I've got to hang up. Don't get struck by lightning. G'bye, darling. Who was that? Bruce Hardy? Uh-uh. Well, who was it? Are you jealous? Oh, don't be silly. I'm never jealous. There's no percentage in that. Who was it? My brother, stupid. Oh, yes. Oh, what? Oh, I know how goofy you are, when I'm not looking. And I think too much of you, babe, to let you go haywire. Why you'd be a sucker to pass up a ready-made charge account like Bruce Hardy. Second act. Places please. Don't you ever get jealous of Hardy, Georgie? What for? Business is business. That guy can make money in any kind of a market. I got nothing but respect for that guy. He's gonna put you up in lights and pull me outta the red. That is, if you're a smart girl and take directions from the old Maestro. Oh, doesn't mama always do what papa says? Doesn't mama... There goes the curtain. Goodbye. Come in. I'm the fuller-brush-man. Oh, I... Hello. Hello. Oh, pardon me. I wasn't expecting... Oh, it's quite all right. If we go out some evening, you'll see more of my shoulders than I see of yours. That'll be swell. Well, I mean to say that is... I hope so. Say, how did you find out where I live? Gilligan told me. Oh, he didn't want to, but I made him. I meant to phone you before, but he said you didn't have a phone. That's right. I haven't. What's the idea? Well, you see, this is where I work and if I had a phone here, why, people would be calling me up and I'd waste a lot of time that way. Oh, if I'm interfering with the wheels of progress, why I'll... Oh, it's quite all right. I'm just about through for the day anyway. At noon? Well, this is my day off. I was up at 6:00. Good heavens! That's when I went to bed. I haven't even had breakfast, yet. A-ha. Oh say, wait a minute. Can't I offer you something else? Yes, an explanation. What made you walk out on me last night? Well, I finished my drink. You think it was nice to leave without saying goodbye? I was afraid if I called myself to your attention, you might ask me to stick around. And you didn't want to? No. Why? I was bored... It's been a good many years since I left college and... Well, all that flaming youth stuff gives me a vast pain in the neck. Me too. Then, why do you go in for it? Well, I've got nothing else to do. Oh, could I have a cup of coffee? You sure can. Oh, fine. Oh, where the... Ah, here we are. Ouch! Oh, thanks. Say, I feel kinda... Will you excuse me while I put on a shirt? Go ahead. Thanks. Excuse my ignorance, but what the... What is it? Take a good look at it. That's my baby. It's what I was born for. What I went to school for. What I'm living for. For that? You bet, for that. That's the greatest motor in the world. Why say some day everybody'll have one of these. You will hear them droning in the skies like a million bees and then... Oh, say I'm sorry. I'm talking like a stock salesman. Excuse me. No, no. I was never so excited in my life. Tell me more. Well to get back to Earth again. I've made a motor that ought to do for aviation what Ford did for automobiles. It's cheap enough so everybody can buy one! Really? Yeah. And it's got a safety combustion feature that's a knockout. The plane can't catch fire or explode. Look here, you see these little... Say do you understand blue prints? Why, no... Blue prints? Oh yes, I understand all about blue prints. Fine. Come here. Now, you've got to quit pickin' at Hardy. You've gotta take him over. How, hon? Gee, Linda, aren't you the babe in the woods. Didn't you ever hear of alimony? Do you mean to stand there and tell me that... Sure, I'm willin' to make a sacrifice, as long as it's for your benefit. Well, Hardy's already engaged, isn't he? All the more reason why you've got to step on it. Where's the fire escape? Oh, that isn't Hardy. He wouldn't ring. Well, if it isn't Hardy, then who is it? Whoever it is, you're waiting for a streetcar. Hello, Linda. Why, hello, Jimmie. Come on in. Thanks. Mr. Keeler, this is my brother, Jim. How do you do? Glad to meet you, Mr. Lee. What do you mean "Lee"? Leonard. Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot. Mr. Keeler's putting on his own show next season. He's been showing me the sketch of the first act set. Look. Isn't it marvelous? Mr. Keeler thinks there might be a place in the show for me. Place is right. The ace spot. If my plans work out, I'm going to fix it so Linda can top the billin'. That's where she belongs. I don't think you ought to put ideas like that into her head. That's the way with brothers. I got a kid sister, too. I'm always under-ratin' her, but take it from me, Mr. Lee... Leonard. Mr. Leonard... That Linda's got talent! I'm telling you, she's got all it takes. How long have you been living here? Oh, about a week or so. You see, I was... This is Sophie Tucker's apartment. Sophie went to London for a few months. So I got her to let Linda have the use of the place while she was gone. Did you ever meet Sophie? A swell gal! How do you like it? It doesn't cost much more than I've been paying. How'd you get my address, Jim? Got it from your landlady. That's where I've just been. Why didn't you let me know you'd moved? I wanted to surprise you. I want you to see the rest of it. The view's marvelous, Jim. Take a look from that window. On a clear day I can see Staten Island. Georgie! Georgie, we've got to get him out of here before Hardy comes. Right, leave it to the Maestro. Shh! Well, I gotta be running along. I gotta date with a couple of song writers. You're going to be mighty proud of that sister of yours someday. Glad to have met you, Mr. Lee. Say, where did you pick that up? Oh, he's all right. Well, I'm waiting for you to rave about my new apartment. How do you like it? A bit gaudy for my taste. But I suppose it's all right. And say, listen, sis, the next time you move, I wish you'd let me know where you go. It's hard enough to find you as it is. I meant to call you up. How's everything at the field? Oh, that's what I wanted to see you about. I'm quitting. I just gave Gilligan my notice. What for? I'm all set to start out for myself. I've saved enough money to make my first motor. You haven't got a lease on this apartment have you? No, not exactly. Why? Because we're likely to have to move to Detroit. Me? Yeah. You see Detroit's a big motor manufacturing center and it's much cheaper to build them there. I figure we'll be moving in a couple of months or so. You'll be moving, not me. Well, you don't suppose I'm going to leave you here alone. You heard what Georgie... What Mr. Keeler said. He's going to star me in his next show. Oh, no. Oh, yes. Now, listen, Linda... Oh, excuse me, Jim. Yes? There's a call for rehearsal, Miss Lee. You're wanted at the theater right away. Oh, yes. I'll be right over. Yes. Yes, thank you. Oh, Jim. That was the theater. They want me right away for rehearsal. Do you suppose I could ever get an hour of your very valuable time? Well, sure you can, honey. Let's have lunch soon. Maybe I'll come up and cook some stew for you in that funny dump of yours. Goodbye, Linda. Goodbye, Jim. I'll give you a ring. Oh, Daddy! It's been so lonesome here without you. I thought you'd never come. Any letters? Just bills. Any phone calls? No, just bills. Well, now that you've dragged me here. What's the man's name again? Let me see. Begins with L. Linger, longer, Leonard. That's it. Leonard. Now, remember, I'm against this. Why Bruce? Well, I think you're silly to spend your money on some silly promoters pipe dream. It isn't a pipe dream. It's the greatest motor in the world. How do you know so much about this Leonard's motor? Why, I got a circular the other day. I wish you'd quit reading circulars... ...and listen to reason. If I'd made a million dollars on this investment, I could afford to listen to reason and if I went broke, I couldn't afford not to. Well, in that case, I hope you go broke. Oh, but I won't go broke. And you'd want to put your own money in it, when you see the motor. And I know you will. Well, I'll go up and take a look at it. On one condition. Hmm? You've got to have lunch with me. Glad to. All right... 12:00 sharp at the Mayfair. It's a date. It's a date. Mr. Leonard? Oh, he's out. Well, that's funny. My secretary made an appointment for me. My name's Hardy. Oh, yes, I remember now. Yes, we did have an appointment. My name's Leonard. How do you do, Mr. Hardy? Well, I know, but you just said... Yes, I said I was out. I meant out of business. You see, I thought you were a collector. Do I look like a collector? In the last month or so everybody looks like a collector to me. Say you know we might be able to do business at that... ...that is if you're interested in scrap iron? Scrap iron? Yes, that's it. Oh. This must be the motor I heard so much about. Well, you don't seem to think so much of it yourself. Mr. Hardy, that's the best motor ever made. It's the cheapest, the strongest, the fastest and the safest. I've told a thousand people that. I've proved it. I'll prove it to you and when I'm all finished, you'll walk out of here and never come back. Yeah? What makes you think I will? Everybody else has. Apparently people are too much interested in buying wildcat oil stock and gold mines to put their money into anything real. I can't sell that motor. I can't give it away. I must be the world's worst salesman. But you're not. You've got me interested already. I have? Mr. Hardy, I'm not going to let you out of this office, until you've listened to me. If you can get in on a thing like this, you won't be making an investment. You'll be making history! Why this is the king of the air. Someday the Leonard motor will encircle the globe. If we can get to making these things, they'll be more popular than radio. Why no family can afford to be without one. That's very funny. Yeah, and believe it or not I convinced him. He put in $5,000 for some client of his and hinted he might get some other people to go in on an even larger scale. Now, what do you think of that? I think it's mean of you to let everybody in, but me. Oh, I don't want any of your money. Gee, I wish you didn't have any money. I wish you were broke. Why? Well, then we could start even. Charlie. Yes, sir. Are you sure Miss Owen hasn't showed up yet? Positive, Mr. Hardy. We're watching for her. All right. Now that you're on the way toward making your pile, why don't you call timeout and have some fun? Take up golf. Golf? That's my idea of a man-sized job. Oh, relax a little. You ought to learn how to play. Play? Play. Seems to me I've heard that word somewhere before. You've forgotten what it means. I'm going to take you in hand. You were my instructor for a while, now we're going to change places. When do we start, teacher? Say, what did you want to see me about? Well, I had a couple of thousand dollars saved that I was thinking about investing in your company. Say, that'll be great. I'll be glad to let you in on the ground floor. Send your check over to the office and I'll take care of you. You needn't bother. I've changed my mind. Well, how come? It took me a long time and I worked like blazes for that money. I don't feel keen on throwing it away. I don't get you, Gilligan. You always believed in that motor. What's changed your mind? You have. If you don't believe in it, how can I? Well, who says I don't? If you do believe in it, why don't you work at it? How do you ever expect to get anywhere if you spend all your time running around like a lap dog after a silly idle wench that's hardly worth... Say, wait a minute. You're a friend of mine and an older man, but I'm liable to forget all about that. Yes, that's just it... ...because I am a friend of yours and an older man that I have a right to speak my mind, and I'm going to do it too. And when I get through, you can give me a sock in the nose. It'll be worth it. Well, you can say anything you want to about me, but please leave her out of it. Well, that's it. If she was out of it, you'd be all right. That's just the trouble. You've lost your pep. You've been neglecting your work. You were on your way up and you tripped on a skirt. Ever since you've been running around with her, you've changed. You've quit being a man. For what? A rag and a bone and a hank of hair, I suppose. Now, you've spent enough time around engines to know that oil and water won't mix. The oil dirties the water and the water weakens the oil. That's a bad mixture, boy. There's no power in it. You'll only crack up in the end. Say, give me a hand with this tie, will you? Hmm... Here, turn around. You know, you're a pompous old ass, Gilligan. I haven't lost my pep. I've just found my stride. And I'm not neglecting my work. I've just found that... Well, there are a lot of other things in the world. You know last Sunday at Forest Hills I broke a hundred on that fifth hole. Ouch! Say, I can tell you this. You'll never make a gentleman's gentleman. And I can tell you this. You'll never make a man's man or any kind of a man. Then, I disown you here and now. You had a great job cut out for you and you traded it for a powder puff. You were going to Detroit to manufacture your motors, and what happened? You met this ball of fluff and here you stay. I'll tell you this. She'll take you and waste you the same as she's wasted everything else. Her time, her money and her womanhood because that's the sort she is and everybody knows it. And now, I'll take that sock on the nose. Get out of here, Gilligan. Go on. Get out of here! Fool. Oh, hello. Good evening, sir. Oh, good evening, Kibbee. May I have your hat and stick, sir? Thank you. Pardon me, sir, but your tie, sir. If I may take the liberty, sir. Well, that's very kind of you, Kibbee. I'm afraid that my valet was a bit careless this evening. Very likely, sir. Do you mind, sir? Good morning, sir. Oh, good morning, Kibbee. Yes, well, this is, er... ...hardly the, er... Right rig for a bright and busy morning, is it, Kibbee? You see, I well I happened to be at a party last night and, huh... ...before you knew it the sun was up. You know how it is sometimes, Kibbee. Yes, sir. Yes. I thought as long as I was passing by that I'd like to have breakfast with Miss Owen. Is she up? Well, sir, during all the years I've ever known her, she's never been up at this hour. Oh, is that so? How long has that been, Kibbee? I've been with the family 30 years. I came here long before Miss Carol was born. You ought to have seen her as a baby. Her father called her The Little Sportsman. A most remarkable child, sir. Well, what was so remarkable about her? She never cried. Her father said she didn't know how to. Oh, stop it you fool. Yes, sir, she's a thoroughbred. Once when her father told her... Well, Kibbee... Breakfast. For two, miss? Yes, Kibbee. Very well, miss. Darling. Make it two. Look, Carol... ...will you marry me? Are you asking me because you came last night... ...and happen to be here this morning. That isn't it. I'd have asked you long ago, only... Only what? Well... You're from Cartier's and I'm from Woolworth's. You've got a ton of money and I haven't got a dime. That's what stopped me. That and a lot of other things. Such as? Oh, what's the difference? I know I'm doing this all wrong. It's just because I'm new at it. I never loved a girl before. I never knew a girl could make a difference as you've made. Why, people that knew me don't recognize me anymore. I don't recognize myself. You've crowded out everything out of my mind, but you. I'll never be any good without you. Please, marry me. No. You don't have to give me any reasons if you don't want to, but I... I would like to know why. Because I like you. You said you'd never be any good without me. That isn't so. You'd never be any good with me. You spoke about my money... But I didn't finish. I wanted to say that I wouldn't touch a cent of it. That we'd have to live on what I could make. It wouldn't be very much at first. Jimmy, it wouldn't be enough to pay my hairdresser. I'm terribly extravagant, Jimmy. You don't want shackles, you want wings. I'd hold you down. I've done it already. I've sidetracked you. You know, you haven't been talking motors, lately. You've been talking golf. You're paying attention to me instead of your work. No, Jimmie, it's no good. You're going somewhere. I'm just a detour. Don't let anyone sidetrack you. I was talking to Kibbee about you this morning. He said your father had a nickname for you, Little Sportsman. I can see why you have not changed. Oh, I'm wise to you sweetheart. You're panning yourself to break the fall for me. You're the finest woman I've ever met. I didn't know they made 'em so fine. There's only one thing I'd like to know. There isn't anyone else, is there? No. There never was and there never will be. Oh, that's what I wanted to hear you say. I'll never be sidetracked again. You know all these things I wanted to do were for myself, but it's different now. I want to knock over the world for you. I'll show you. Jimmy, where are you going? To grab the world by the tail for you! Oh, taxi! 28 E 42nd. Mr. Leonard's forgotten his walking stick, miss. Oh, that's all right, Kibbee. He won't need it. Yes? Oh, one moment please. Mr. Hardy, miss. I want to talk business with you. Oh, you do? I've turned the matter of Leonard Motors over to some associates of mine. They've investigated it fully. Their report is highly satisfactory. They recommend I go in to it.Well... Well, for the past few weeks you've spent most of your time with young Leonard. Now, what I want to know is... Are you interested in the motor or the man? From the viewpoint of a businessman, what difference does that make? Well, from the viewpoint of an admirer, a suitor, you can hardly expect me to finance a rival. Bruce, I can honestly say he is no rival of yours. In that case, I feel free to ask you for the 57th time to marry me. I've promised myself that I'll never entertain an offer of marriage, unless I'm broke. Carol, you are broke. What? You mean the money I invested in the Leonard Motors is lost? That wasn't your money. You haven't had any money in over a year. Then, what have I been living on? I've taken the liberty of advancing you what money you needed. I hope you'll understand. I pretended I was making investments for you because I realized that you... Well, I didn't want you to worry about money. That's why I didn't tell you before. Then, why did you tell me now? Because you said you wouldn't entertain an offer of marriage unless you were broke. Bruce, would you like it if I married you for your money? I'd like it, if you married me for any reason at all. Suppose I were to tell you that in the past I haven't been all together... Well, all together... Well, then I'd be compelled to tell you neither have I. But that's in the past. Will you marry me? You're very sweet, Bruce, and you've been a good friend. I must have cost you a good deal in the past. It was fun watching you spend it. I'll spend a lot more in the future. I suppose you will. I look upon you as a luxury, but I have luxurious tastes. Is it a bargain, Carol? I'd rather you wouldn't call it a bargain. Now take a letter to Bruce Hardy, 44 Wall Street, New York City. Dear, Sir... For reasons I do not care to discuss, I wish to inform you that I am no longer interested in the syndicate you were organizing to take over my airplane motor. Nor do I wish to receive any further money from you for investment in my business under any circumstances. This is final and not subject to further discussion. Yours, very truly. See that goes out at once, will you? Special delivery. Hello, Jim. Hello, Gilligan. You're looking fine, boy! Sit down. Thanks. I won't take up much of your time. I just dropped in to see if you're still willing to let me in on the ground floor? I've brought my check-book with me. Oh... I suppose you read that item in the paper about Hardy buying in. Well, I just wrote him a letter telling him I don't want any of his money. That's just what I was going to advise you to do. He'd probably try to freeze you out of the company, if he ever got control. These money guys usually do. Well, can I buy some stock? A few weeks ago you didn't want to buy any stock. What's changed your mind? It was an item about Hardy all right, but it wasn't on the financial page. Yeah, you're through with stunt flying. You've made a safe landing and you're all right now, boy. With all her money she has to marry for more money. Well, that's the best thing she can do for you... Marry Hardy. And the next time you see her, you'll want to thank her. I'm never going to see her again. I'm cured, Gilligan. You can bet on that. I am betting on it. Yes, I've got the architects plans for the factory right in front of me, now. And I want you to come down, skipper, and take a look at it. We can close the deal for that anchorage on Long Island. We ought to have wheels turning by next spring. Righto Gilligan, I'll be seeing you. Well, there's a depression, Mr. Hardy. Everything's gone down, but I'm not quite that cheap. You can't pay me off like a waiter's check and get away with it. The rent's paid for the balance of the lease. And this is an apartment not a stage. The part you're playing doesn't suit you. You are much more effective as an ingenue. And may I ask what lawyer wrote your lines for you? You'll find out, when he slaps a summons in your face to appear in a Breach of Promise case. I never promised to marry you. I told you I had no intention of marrying you. Why you're pretty nearly old enough to be my father and if you want to see how good an ingenue I am, watch me do my stuff in a courtroom. You don't think I'm paying you enough? Huh? I know that you're not. Well, get this... Millions for defense, but not another cent for tribute. Not another cent. You poor sap. You dumb half-wit. What do you mean "half-wit"? No, no, I take it back. That's gross exaggeration? Ten thousand bucks. You couldn't put a vaudeville act on for that. Didn't I tell you to hold out for fifty? I did the best I could, Georgie. Oh... Why didn't you turn on the weeps like I told you to? Well... Here, I book my neck coachin' you and you pull a Sadie Thompson. And you want to get big? How can you be a head-liner without a hit? I did the best I could, Georgie! That's all he'd go for. Aw, don't show your ignorance. You've pushed over the apple cart. Oh, all right, we'll go for grapefruit. But you don't know him. He's terribly stubborn. So am I, babe. Remember, there're four aces in every deck. We've only played one of them. Oh, Kibbee. Yes, miss? You can't approve of me anymore, do you? Oh, miss, I... I can see it in your eyes. I've tried not to show it. But it shows. Come on, Kibbie, out with it. Why, you haven't even wished me happiness in my marriage. But I do with all my heart. Go on, old Kibbee, You've known me a long, long time. Well, miss, if you'll excuse me, you won't be happy with Mr. Hardy! Why no, certainly not. One can't have everything. And I've had my share of happiness in the past. No, you haven't. You've been very unhappy and very lonely. Suppose I were to tell you that my marriage to Mr. Hardy wasn't entirely selfish. That it was to help somebody else. Would that help? But it still wouldn't be fair to you or to somebody else. It wouldn't even be fair to Mr. Hardy. You mid-Victorian old fossil. Do you know that Mr. Hardy has been paying your salary for the past year? I have it in the bank. He's welcome to it. Do you realize that we're broke, full of debts and all we have left is this house? But we could sell the house and pay the debts. That's what your father would have done, Miss Carol. Now, don't stand there arguin'. Hardy gets married day after tomorrow and we gotta act quick. But Georgie, don't you think it be more, sorta dignified to sue? And get me dragged into it? That'd spoil everything. Besides sometimes those cases take years to settle. You wanna wait till you're a character woman to see your name in lights? But I'm afraid to tell Jim. He'll get so sore he's liable to turn on me. Fine. The sorer he gets the better I like it. I want him to get so sore he'll go gunnin' for Hardy. Will you do as I tell you? Yes, Georgie. Fine. Now remember and go the limit. Spoil a couple of handkerchiefs if you have to. Remember that scene in The Little Mother To Be? Well, pull that if you have to and then gimme a ring and we'll wait for brother Jim to start the fireworks. But do you think... I guarantee. Hardy'll reach for a fountain pen before brother Jim reaches for a gun. Yes, Georgie. Well, all right. There's the overture. Mr. Leonard, please. Yes? Your sister to see you, Mr. Leonard. Oh, send her in. Well, well, well. What are you doing below Broadway and 42nd Street? Don't tell me you've given up the show business. Well, what's wrong Linda? I come to say goodbye, Jim. I'm going away. Where? Oh, I don't know, anywhere. Don't ask me anything, Jim. I just wanted to see you before I left. Oh, Jim. What is it, Linda? Oh, I wish I was never born. You'll hate me, Jim. Why didn't I take your advice? Come on, sis. Who is it? Oh, what's the difference? He won't marry me. He can't. He's going to marry somebody else. Who is it? Oh, I don't want to drag your name into it. Not when your business is doing so well. I don't care about myself. It's, well, it's... Who's the man? You've got to tell me. Who is it? It's Hardy. Bruce Hardy. Yes? I'm going out. If anybody phones, I won't be back this afternoon. Yes, sir. It's all right, sis. Bryant 3-6-3-8-0. Hello, Georgie? Linda. It's okay. Uh-huh. Is Mr. Hardy in Yuma? Yes, Miss Owen. He's in the library. Carol! Hello, Bruce. Well, this is a surprise. Sit down. No, I'm not staying long. I tried to get you on the phone. You were going to call me. I decided it would be cowardly to use the phone for what I have to tell you. Even now Bruce, it isn't easy. Well, that doesn't sound as though you have something agreeable to tell me, does it? Give me a cigarette, will you? Yes. Thanks. Bruce, you must believe me, when I say... A gentleman to see you, sir. He says it's very urgent. Excuse me, dear. I'll only be a minute. Hello, Leonard. What brings you here? I'm here to tell you that your marriage to Miss Owen is not going to take place. What the devil are you talking about, Leonard? I think I can tell you. Mr. Leonard is a very high-minded young man. He's the kind of a man that believes a wife should have no secrets from her husband. He's sure I haven't told you. So he's come here to tell you himself. I didn't come here to talk about you. Then, why did you come here? To tell Hardy that he hasn't the right to marry you. He's got to marry my sister. Your sister. I don't know your sister. Yes, you do. Linda Lee. Does that name mean anything to you? So you're Linda Lee's brother. Your sister? I'm beginning to understand. And I'm beginning to understand. Why you're guilty of the very thing you're accusing me of. Not quite, Bruce. Mr. Leonard did ask me to marry him. Well then, why didn't you? Was it because you were broke and couldn't afford him? Is that why you got me to put all that money in his company? That's a lie. You know that I didn't touch a cent of your money. You know that I turned it down. No? Well, perhaps you didn't know that I own the controlling interest in the Leonard Motors Corporation. I bought it through my agents. You have Miss Owen to thank for that. Is that true? I'm afraid it is. We all seem to be telling the truth. All right then, I'll get out of the company. I don't want any help from either of you. But what you've told me doesn't change my reason for coming here. Now, just a moment. I've listened to both of you. Now, listen to me. There's something you apparently don't know. Does the name on that check mean anything to you? I'm sorry, Hardy. If it still means anything to you... Allow me to congratulate you on your marriage. We can hardly accept his congratulations, can we? I'm perfectly willing to ignore your past, principally because I have one of my own. But when a woman takes a husband for the sole purpose of furthering the career of a lover... Please, Bruce... Be a good sport. Let me make the gesture. Thanks, old chap. Now, get this stupid. Here's a special number that Harry Davis and I cooked up for you. It's gonna be your first duet with a juvenile on the job. Get the lyrics. ? Our eyes are like the stars dear ? Like Venus and like Mars, dear ? And that's just why I fell in love with you ? Your kisses are emphatic ? It's so aristocratic ? Ad that's just why I fell in love with you ? From your sweet lips ? The honey drips ? With such a honeyed sound ? Constantly just like a bee ? I always buzz around. ? You're everything I'm craving ? You've got me madly raving ? And that's just why I fell... ? Get your hat and coat. Why, Jim... Come on. Now, listen, Keeler. Every time I see you, I'm going to take a sock at you. If I ever hear of you speaking to my sister again, even on the telephone, I'll kill you. Come on. Where are we going, Jim? Someplace where I can beat the daylights out of you. But Georgie... Shut up. Everything on the menu, Felice. I want to look my very best this afternoon. An appointment, mademoiselle? A very special appointment. You might even call it a rendezvous. Oh, hand me that pad and pencil, will you? Thanks. You got her all tuned up, Ray? You bet I have, Miss Owen. She's all ready for you. Okay, let's go. Oh, Ray... Give this to Gilligan will you? You bet I will. Thanks. Hello, Jim. Hello, Gilligan. Glad to see you, boy. Thank you. If you've come here to sell me any more Leonard Motors stock... I'm not selling any stock. I'm not even with Leonard Motors anymore. Here's a note for you, Mr. Gilligan. Yeah, thank you. I'm here looking for my old job back. Your girlfriend came back today, too. Who Miss Owen? Yeah. She's just taking off. Contact. Contact. One, two, three! What's this? What's the matter? Carol! Carol! Carol! Carol!
