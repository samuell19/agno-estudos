Los Angeles seems agree with him. - Really? - Yes. He said he does not miss New York. I knew he would flee. He was very weak to stay here forever. You know what I want? - An omelet. - Wait, I'm curious. Why so much hate Los Angeles? Why is the epicenter everything that is bad? Wait. Dave told me something cool about Los Angeles. No, listen. He said the city is a huge white screen. Everything that you bring is all that should be. It's a random collection neighborhoods, where it's always sunny and basically reflects everything back to you. If you're happy, LA is great. If not, LA is crap. But it has nothing to do with LA. Why, look: it does not exist. E. ..? That's it. If you do not feed me, I will eat your face. Come on. What's going on? Dave said what? He wants me as a partner. Half and half. But ... We would have to be there. When? At the end of the month. And you want? What's missing? A great theme. Because the new novels, you know? I base that I in? - I do not know. - Exactly.

I'm afraid of never walk to a place. I'm afraid do not turn things over to but to open markets. - And pilates classes. - Are the best classes. - There is no order there. - This is ridiculous. They have no culture. New York has it all. The best restaurants, theaters, museums. And how many museums you go, in a typical week? - I'm just curious. - This is not the issue. What's the fun of living here, if ever enjoyed? It is better to live anywhere else, sometimes visit and things to do. Go to McDonalds, one concert Broadway at the Carnegie Deli. "What a great sandwich. Do not know if anything like that. " - I Love NY. - You are very unhappy. Am. But is not the fault of New York. NY is ... A home. You're asking me to leave my home.

We can not stay with him. - Sam, do not get it. - I will not stay. Calm down. Sorry for the ball. It is the only one I had. Hello. Okay. I thought that would would happen. It's the end? I'm fine. Thanks. Did you know that my best financial year in NY, were when I smuggled marijuana? You do not need Dave, or a bad city, to do something big. I believe in you. Why? You're my man. You are my great and funny hairy man. No need to predict everything, okay? You will find their niche, and we have money one day. - This is how it works. - No. Not here. Not always. I just want to feel that everything I passed by ... I do not know. I'm just tired. Sorry. I'm not the type that will for Happy Hour, but ... Sorry I can not. It's a weekday. - Bye. - Okay, bye.

Made it look like not known. I think you're terrific. I think. So can not hear you sing, because it can change what you think. - What if I'm amazing? - And if not? - And if it's bad writer? - I'm not. Wow. You're trouble.

You really either end, is not it? I'm trying abandon the idea that we have to pay the joy with sadness or tragedy. That there must be some kind of balance. Seems to be that way, understand? Absolutely. You are very intelligent. I do this thing ... I do not believe I'm counting. When you want bad stories about me, I have several. Right. A year ago, was in that taxi. And the taxi driver, an Indian started talking about various things. He was watching me rearview mirror, and said happiness. Happiness is your right birth. And I kinda like this: 45 with Madison? And he said you have great potential in this life. The secret to life is gratitude. You do not thank enough. I asked how to do that. He said it was simple. It was just to say thanks. I asked when. He said he always now. He said that after say thank you, I have to say: More, please. Wait. "Thank you, again, please?" So with gratitude, the universe is abundant forever. So I took a chance for gratitude. "Thanks, more please" "Thanks, more please." - I sound crazy. - No, think. Did you notice the difference? - No. - No? I mean, yeah, whatever ... Anyway, what brought him to be a photographer? I would not call a photographer. What would you call? I shoot. Why did you shoot? When I see something I like to look ... Can I keep looking.

It's making me sad and I want to leave. Know how long we met? One week. Only a week. When we were playing the house was cool, but ... Sorry about Rasheen. What did you expect to happen? I noticed what the problem is. You write short stories. And guess who likes to live short stories. But I'm ready to live a romance, you know? We will want red or white? Sam. We need to talk. That conversation where I'm cool, but you can not get involved. And it's not me, you, and you is damaged and could not be. I refuse to have this conversation. So, either red or white? Sam. I'm not good for you. What? Are you happy? No, I'm not happy! I can make you happy. Seriously, let me love you. I am willing to do that. Actually, I've started. - I can not; - No, no, no. Please do not run from something that has not even started. Look at me. I understand, right? I understand it. I'm not the guy who thought for you. And if you do not know what is best for you? - And would you know? - I believe so. - From where you came, Sam 2? - Westchester. Want to know why I'm on the 5th floor? The first time I saw ... My God, I thought ... "Wow." She! The girl with panels on the head. I want to stay with her. Believe. I do not usually talk like that. - But I'm crazy about you. - Stop. Shut the fuck up! - Why? - Stop, please. Do not say that. You can hear it! Close your eyes. - What? - I just want to listen. Help, please. It is not easy to be adored. You should also find more difficult, I understand! But I wanted you to try. Look at it as an experiment. I promise to be wonderful to worship her, Annie. It is an area where I think I have a great talent. You are worth this worship, Annie. You're worth. And the fact that you do not believe do not be true or not. It's true for me. And that's what matters. Wexler! A writer I know I said a great thing. He said that every five years realized the jerk who was five years ago. Every five years, he says: "Man, I was so lame five years ago! " If we accept this, all we think, feel and we now say, in five years will be shameful. - This talk? - The worst! - We hate this talk. - I hate it. Let's hate in four years. Played a sport as a child? - Yes. - Remember "comes out of this? No matter what. Even if your eye going out, the technician would come, you looked and said: "You okay, son. Snap out of it. " And I know that sometimes, I was really hurt, but only in having this idea out of this, as a way of, I dunno, heal me. It worked. I left that shit. Lately I feel ... I'm more resistant than I thought. But who knows? Maybe I feel different in five years. Who knows? Leave a message after the tone. Right. I think that's, but it is sad and not to bother. But I have a story to tell. And you need to hear. So listen well. The scene. Dinner with the No. 2. Trying to get rid of him. No such luck. Then, look at that. You know what to say Beauty is inside? But that's a lot of shit. Beauty is overseas. And I love a beauty. Who does not? But here's the crazy, Sammy Boy I'm listening to Sam, 2, listening. Because he made me close eyes, so exciting! And he makes a case for me and him being together. And as he spoke, it was like the molecules of his face must have neat, because I opened my eyes and nothing, I am in front the handsomest man and wonderful. How crazy! Whoever thought? 2 Sammy! And you were right. It's a strong name. So, here's what you want tell me the beep before cutting. Sadness go away. Let's be people who deserve to be loved. Worthwhile. Why are worth! We are worth it! You tell me that for years and now I can say back. You're a Good Man, Sam Wexler. Go be loved. That's it. Hello, Jill. Sam Wexler. I think Mary Catherine said I'd call. They moved to another house. Thanks. Right. That last song ... It's a happy song. On a happy song. That's what I need to hear now. Thank you all.
