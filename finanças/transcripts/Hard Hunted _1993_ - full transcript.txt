Oh my goodness, the outrageously gorgeous Becky has just brought me a cup of coffee and made my day. I guess I've got the world's best job in broadcasting, folks. I'm right here in the midst of tropical beauty and one of those beauties is coming through the door right now. Here she is to take the mic and steal your hearts, they're all yours, Ava. Thanks, Shane abilene. Aloha, Hawaii. It's Ava, your moonlight mistress. Let's spend the night together. Just let me get comfortable and you can call me here at edy's place, in the hotel molokai remember, the content of the show is the exclusive property of k-s-x-y and cannot be duplicated without written permission.

And the beat goes on, k-s-x-y_ This one's for Mr. big. Neptune, your planetary ruler, endows you with fertility and good luck. Now I have a message for the lone surfer who is a Taurus. Certain planetary factors indicate that the waves are good for tonight at nine at your favorite beach. Thanks, Ava.

My cover's been blown. I got something really big this time and I gotta get out of town. You gotta take me to the airport now. Yes, Ava”? Edy, it's the hotline. I'll be right there. K-s-x-y radio, molokai. And now back to your midnight mistress. Hello, Ava's love line. Hello, Ava. I'm a loyal listener. It's mika I've been unfaithful and I've run away for good. My lover's very powerful and I'm afraid of him. Sounds like her cover's blown. I have to get to a safe place. I need a friend. We all need to get away from bad relationships. How far are you willing to go? All the way. I wanna share this gift of love that I carry with me before it's destroyed by hate. Take this opportunity to distance yourself until your lover has worked out his rage elsewhere. Try to meditate in a special area such as just north of sedona, Arizona, where the magnetic vortex at cathedral rock is a site of great regeneration. Yes. Okay, I've got it. A place just north of sedona, Arizona. Cathedral rock. Thanks, Ava, I think I'll try that. What's this all about? About this Kane seems to think it's the key to world domination. I'm sure Lucas will know what to do with it. Ditch this for me. I gotta go. I gotta catch the red eye to Phoenix. Sir, you're gonna have to move that car. Indian legends say that sedona is the spiritual mecca of the world. Well as long as we're not near a phone, my spirit is just fine. Oh, all I wanna do is just tan my body from head to toe. Ah It's a tough job. But somebody's gotta do it. What the hell is a klystron relay? It's a super conductor, sir. Capable of withstanding incredible heat and radiation. Very small, easily transportable. Senator, a klystron relay is a trigger for a nuclear bomb. I see Lucas, this report indicates that one of these devices was stolen from a red Chinese lab. It could be a deliberate attempt by the Chinese to shake us. General, how long ago did this occur? Naval intelligence believes that the klystron relay was smuggled out of China sometime yesterday afternoon. A drop seems to be made over the Hawaiian islands. Kane. That's why I'm here. You have agents in Kane's organization? Yes, and a tracer around his neck. If he makes a move, I'll know it. Lucas, if a klystron relay were to wind up in the middle east, we could be facing a whole new ballgame. Rag has already been importing lithium-6. If Kane were to sell them a nuclear trigger, they'd have everything they need for a full-scale arsenal. And that's just one possible scenario. Kane has arms connections to every third world war-zone. We must catch him before he sells it. We were not to be disturbed except for an emergency. Lucas, it's for you. Finally. Lucas, I've been trying to reach you for hours and they couldn't locate you. Agent stark, I'm in a top priority meeting. Slow down. Mika is headed to the mainland with a gift? That she stole from Kane? Gentlemen, I think my team already has some information that will help us out. Where's mika headed? I'l be there as soon as I can. Just don't forget to come out to molokai and thank me personally, Mr. bigshot desk jockey. Good work, slim. Sir! Sir! He's dead the lovely Jade... Is gone! Mika's missing. So our little humming bird becomes a whore. Captain, a wind surfer's approaching. Mr Kane did mika have the Jade? You mean that little green Buddha? So she has it? And you let her go? There was tourists around fool! You're not even a decent prototype for a double agent. Kill him wait! Wait! I know where she went I know where she went! Did you say something? Where did she go? Sedona, Arizona. Yes. To meet up with fellow agents, no doubt. I will spare your life now. I eave hey! Hey! Americans what was your wise strategy in sparing the wind surfer? He's still a valuable source of information. And easy enough to kill, should I so decide. The emissaries from the middle east will be here within three days. By then I will have the Jade back. I have a contact in Arizona he's reliable he's Asian You hear that? Looks like we've got company. Yeah It's mika I have a feeling I can forget about my tan. Donna, Nicole! Mika, hold on, honey, we'll get you out of here. How is she? She's dead. Those bitches must have the Jade. We've gotta go back for her! No, we're in deep enough as it is! I don't know how we're gonna lose that thing. Damn, Chris, it's a 110 in the shade. Yeah but it's a dry heat. So they tell me. Damn, there's something you don't see everyday! Son of a bitch is shooting! Rick, get on the radio! Report in! This is baker seven! We've got an armed helicopter in pursuit of a dune buggy on blood basin road! Do you copy me? Over! The son of a bitch is coming for us! Nail him! Attention central units, send patrol cars and helicopters for cover! We're in a war here! Baker seven, this is police control. We have dispatched two patrol units to your area. Three air national guard helicopters are in route. Eta, one minute. Please acknowledge. Baker seven, do you read? Baker seven, come back. At least we got away. Yeah we'll call someone to pick up mika's body. Where are we going? The airport. We gotta find out what's going on. This must have something to do with Kane. This has been some day. Six, number six! Come in, number six! Six, here. You must intercept two women and tell me where they're going. Last seen on highway 17 heading south. Who are they? Donna Hamilton and Nicole Justin Operation central. How may I direct your call? This is Nicole Justin, 0-1-3-0. I have a priority red situation. Connect me with commander Lucas immediately! The office can't get through to Lucas. He just got on a plane at Andrews air force base. Where'd he go? They don't know, it's classified. Highest priority? What're we gonna do? Standard procedure in an emergency is to go back to home base. Next plane to Hawaii? Yes. Lucas will just have to meet up with us there. Control, get this message to Lucas, asap. Here you are, flight 82 to lax. You should make your connection to Honolulu with no problem. Thanks, let's go. They're on their way to Honolulu. Good. Return to base You're not displeased with my miserable failure, Mr. Kane? Donna Hamilton and Nicole Justin are returning to the island. They can hand the Jade over to me then afterwards I can watch them die. I need more trusted friends around me, raven. You and your mighty aircraft must come to Honolulu without delay! As you wish. Prepare raven for transport. What a mess, damn. All right. This is edy. Put on the scrambler done. So, you gonna talk dirty now? Just dirty business. Edy, mika's dead fill me in Donna and Nicole are coming your way. They may know something about mika's death. Have Bruce Christian and Shane abilene meet them at molokai cargo hanger. Okay. I'll be getting in around five o'clock. Be there okay. Edy, I'm sorry. Mika was a good lady. That she was, Lucas. Captain? Yes, sir. We're changing course for molokai. We can refuel at Edwards air force base in California. As an agent in training. Mm-hmm? You're gonna have to know how to handle this big guy. I'm an expert. Let me show you how it's done. See those cans over there? Uh-huh. Watch those puppies fly. Oh! Wow, here, let me try. Okay, now, easy. Sight's a little low. Hmmmm beginner's luck. Mm-hmm_ Here's a message for our two gemini hunks. Your soul sisters are coming home and you should be there to meet them. Shane, mika's been killed. The period of the full moon in aries draw people together even earlier than they planned. For your sextrology forecast, dial 5-5-5-k-s-x-y. I'll be waiting for your call. This message is for the scorpio sailor. There are certain times of the year when it is not wise to push your luck. November niner-niner 786, this is Honolulu tower you're clear for takeoff, runway seven west. Cole, what're you doing here? Mika told me this was the place to meet in an emergency. I heard Ava put out a coded message on the radio. The message was for us. Look, I may not be a full-fledged agent but mika brought me into this to help you guys, so here I am all right. What do you think of that guy, Bruce? I don't know you know, mika trusted him and now she's dead. He didn't seem to know about that mika recruited him out of the local police. Maybe he's on the level. Yeah, probably. I don't like him showing up here uninvited. Shane, call edy and let her know we're here. I'm gonna wait for Donna and Nicole. Bruce and I have arrived at the strip, edy. When should we expect Donna and Nicole? They're on there way from Honolulu. They should be arriving in molokai any minute. Okay, edy, we'll be watching out for them. Good, let me know when they get there. Vulture one, this is Cole. This is vulture one. We copy. Here's a love line tip from Ava for our two fly girls. The eclipse tells me that a hot reception is waiting in the form of two gorgeous hunks. Mmm, some girls have all the luck. Lucas must've received our message. Yeah, Bruce and Shane will probably be waiting for us. They should be here any minute. Have you seen Cole? No Wait, there they are. I hear you had a nasty time of it. Right. I'm gonna button up the plane. Let edy know we're here. Sure. Thanks. Lucas' orders are for all of us to stay together until he arrives. He thinks that Kane might try some kind of all-out attack. Vulture one, come on in. I've got the Jade. Donna! Kill them! Nicole, no! Shane? What is going on? Shane, come back! Shane? Shane, come back! Shane, cover us! He's dead! This has been some day. We've reached your coordinates, Mr. Kane. Fxcellent I et me talk to the divine miss Hamilton here she is, sir. Miss Hamilton, I greatly regret that I'm not there to witness this, the moment of your death and defeat. I'm willing to wait for 3 more convenient time. Ah, a charming idea but no. This is the way it must be. My main objective was to recover my stolen property, which has been accomplished. I didn't realize you were such an avid art collector. The finest art always holds more than meets the eye. As a work of art, yourself, you should appreciate that. Ha, cute of you to say. It 1s my pleasure, miss Hamilton. Just as it is now my pleasure to order your death. My men will drop you from three thousand feet into the arms of the pacific. Parachute optional? Parachute not included bye, Donna Hamilton. You were a worthy adversary. You can go screw yourself, Mr. Kane. Certainly. Pico's base is on laysan island. You are two kilometers from there. Refuel when you arrive then bring the Buddha to me on Maui. Get rid of that grenade, you crazy bitch! What do you think you're doing? You'll kill us both! Turn this plane around, now! You don't have the stones. Stones? I'll show you stones. You bitch! Where is it? Fuck! An astonishing woman. Do you think she survived that explosion? Yes. She has my Jade and she is on laysan island. Undoubtedly, pico will find her. But he is rash and may fail me. Instruct Cole to go to laysan and secure both items for me. Have him leave at once. We'll be on the dock in Maui in one hour, sir. Fxcellent I'm tired, my love. How could you trust Cole? Trust? I have a hold on Cole more powerful than loyalty. Fear come. I'd like to have a cigarette on deck first. Very well. Ava, listen to me. Yes, silk? Yes? Yes, I understand. Okay, I'll get right on it. She's alive. Bring her. I can see something's gone horribly wrong. Tell me everything you know. Silk contacted Ava. We think Donna's alive Donna had the Jade on her when Kane's men kidnapped her. Lucas, we know where the base is. She blew up the plane and bailed out near one of Kane's smuggling bases. It's laysan island. About 200 miles from here. Have Ava send out a message. Already on it. If Donna's anywhere near a radio, she'll get word. Good work. Lucas, I think it's time to go get Donna. You and Bruce leave as soon as your ready. Let's go. There's nothing we can do till morning. Even James Bond takes time out for sex. Who? Remember, your primary objective is that Jade Buddha. At all costs, Kane must not get his hands on it again. Lucas, there's something that you're not telling us. Donna is a hell of a lot more important than some stupid artifact. I'm coming to that. Three days ago a klystron relay was stolen from a red Chinese laboratory. It was delivered to Kane so the relay is hidden in this Jade Buddha? Exactly. Look, Nicole, I know how you feel about Donna. I want her back too. But possession of that relay could alter the balance of world power. You have two choices you get it or destroy it. That's it well what're we standing around for? Let's go. There's one thing I don't understand. How did Kane know where mika was going? Silk told us that mika was betrayed by Cole and that he turned out to be a double agent. Doesn't that put silk in danger? Mika didn't tell him about silk I don't think I ever met this Cole. You didn't he was a local cop that mika used as a bagman. As far as Cole knew, mika was a sole source of information. Poor mika that's one more thing this Kane has to pay for. This is k-s-x-y radio! Hello, blondie. This one's for you. As the sun is passing through your opposite side of libra, you are probably feeling unusually lonely and insecure. So good morning, sleeping beauty. How do you feel, aye? Don't feel like talking? I get that way too sometimes. You know, moody. I like that in a person. I always feel more like talking after a good cup of coffee. Now I'm embarrassed your hands must stay tied, I'm afraid. Where's your manners? Bring this lady some asprin. They're good boys. They just ain't got no manners. There now you'll feel better. You had a nasty fall. Do you remember how you got here? You really don't remember, do you? Well, I guess some introductions are in order. My name is Rodrigo pico. This is skip, my associate. Bueno this 1s my camp. And you, your name is Donna Hamilton. Donna? Becky? Could I have some coffee please? This is Ava's love line on k-s-x-y radio and I'm speaking to you, blondie. Your uncle is out there looking for you. He won't stop until he's found you. So hang in there. Look, we hold her for one day. He picks her up, we split 60 thousand dollars. You saw that badge in her bag. She's a fed. We gotta get rid of her pronto. Kane knows what he's doing. Man, that bastard wouldn't lift a finger to help you. Now we can't hold this chick too long or we're gonna have the costal patrol on our ass. You're a disloyal gringo and you got a dirty mouth. She's got amnesia. You know what that is? She's harmless. We do what Kane says. Yeah let's just see what happens. Stop right there! Come here! Pico, out here! I'm looking for pico. Kane told me the name of the man coming to my camp. It was a funny name. Do you have a funny name, stranger? Cole waters. That's funny enough. Where's the girl? In a big rush. No manners. I'll take you to her anyways. She's been staring into space all day. She got a big knock on the head and lost her memory. Amnesia? She doesn't seem to know she's a fed. What does Kane want her for anyway? That's none of your business. No, maybe not. But I could sell a woman like that for very big money. Did Kane send you with very big money? You can take that up with him when he gets here. He's coming here? Donna, we all thought you were dead. Oh, sure. Hey, take it easy. Easy. Why don't you give that back? Come on, Donna, you shouldn't be playing with guns. You're doing great so far. Why don't you come back? Ain't she a beauty? Yeah, if I knew what it was. What the hell is it? Wiley, my friend, this magnificent machine just happens to be the cutting edge in all-purpose water transport technology. Allow me to introduce you to the acme hovercraft model a-33-7 are you crazy? You don't even know how to drive a car that's the beauty of it. It comes with a manual I knew I never should've let you go to that boat show alone. Wiley, this will impress our client. Well, what do you know about this guy anyway? I never heard of him before. That's because he's a smooth operator. The smart ones always keep a low profile. Come on, Kane's expecting us at his house in 10 minutes. We'll be late Let me get this straight, you are? Wiley, sir. And you? Coyote, sir. Wiley and coyote. Yes, sir. They're code names. Not our real names not our real names of course. It's remarkable how I ucas can track me I want you to eliminate him and that singing girlfriend of his. Now don't worry, monsieur Kane, two for the price of one. When we are finished with her, she will be singing the song of death and Lucas will applaud her from hell. In other words, consider it done. Fxcellent What do you think, sir? I think they're a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic. You know, I get real bad vibes from that Kane dude. Yeah like he don't think we can pull this off. Well, this one's mine. You drive, I'll shoot. You know, I still feel guilty for not going with Nicole and Bruce. Someone has to stay here and keep an eye on camp. Show me that gadget again. You know how I love new toys. With this, I can always tell where Kane is. Right now, it looks like he's anchored off buzz's wharf silk is the key to our strategy. Silk was a consort of Kane's. The agency persuaded her to come over to our side. She was given a microchip by which we could track Kane via satellite 24 hours a day. Silk attached the microchip to a piece of jewelry which Kane never takes off I distributed receivers like mine to Nicole and Bruce and to Ava as well since silk planted the tracer on Kane, I've been content to just observe him, foil his plans. But now that he's smuggling nuclear arms, that's a big charge. Big enough to put him away forever. You down how to drive this floating ceiling fan, don't you? It's supposed to be easy. Well, here, keep reading the manual. Hey, pal. Can you spare a couple of beers? Sure, help yourself. Thanks a lot, bud. Gee, but you really know how to treat a girl. Only the best for you, darling. Ah, wiley, she's incredible. Life's one big party for those fat cat bastards. Yeah, well let's crash the party. Yeah, let's. I'm out of here! You wouldn't have any explosives on you, would you? Yeah but you're gonna have to carry me home. Fair enough. Heel! Exploding woman's shoe. Footwear! What? Damn, baby. You sure know how to bait a hook. You lunatic! Why didn't you jump? The captain does not desert the ship. This ain't the Titanic! It's the same principle. According to silk, the smugglers' camp is on the other side of the island next to a large lagoon. Nice having the element of surprise on our side for once. Let's go. We've got a long hike ahead of us and not much time. We have some important news for lost blondie tonight, if you can hear me. Don't be taken in my strangers. Be on your guard. Your uncle is on track but you must hold on until morning. This k-s-x-y, molokai, Hawaii. The hottest radio under the sun I kept thinking, Rodrigo, what's the deal here? This 1s Kane's property and so is she. And so, I'm sure, are you. Me, I'm an independent contractor. You know, freelance. Kane will pay you for this. I'm sure of that. But will I get my due? What is that thing you're holding? Is that what this is all about? Why is Kane so desperate he has to send some punk to check up on me? Easy, buddy! Try to shoot me? No manners. Tie him up. Kane will kill you for this. Tomorrow maybe we can have a civilized talk. I can see you're too upset right now. Ava, I'm turning up the transmission to full power. That and watering down the antenna should double our range. Donna should be able to hear us all the way out on laysan. There, now you're doing it right. We'll get what we deserve from that Kane bastard. Man, you bring me down with that crap. We'll find out what little Buddha's about and we'll find out what the girl's worth. I bet anything we can get more for her in Hong Kong than Kane offers. Donna must be in that barn. There's a guard over by the hut. How do you wanna plan this? We just go in and kick ass. That's a plan. Now's our chance, come on! Donna! Come on! Cole? Cole? Freeze! All right. Gun, down! Down! Drop your weapon! Drop it! Now what you gonna do? This. Jeez, Nicole, he had a knife to my throat. I could've been killed it's a chance I had to take. Where's Donna? That bastard, Cole! He dragged her off on a jet ski. They must have the Jade with them. Damn it! Let's go, come on! Ah My dear raven, so good to see you. My extreme pleasure and honor, Mr. Kane. In this folder, you'll find a map to a small island. You will attach extra fuel tanks to your marvelous gyro and fly there. And what would you have me do there, sir? Get the Jade Buddha. Kill everyone who stands in your way. It's all explained in there. You leave at once I will follow aboard my yacht and meet you there tomorrow. Kane's on the move! Damn it, so was I. Come on, let's go. We still haven't heard from long lost blondie. We're worried about you. Let the stars guide you to safety. The road ahead is treacherous. The green amulet you carry poses grave danger. Kane's on his way. We'll hit ground running at first light. I'm your friend. You can trust me you were kidnapped by those men. Who am I? Why would someone wanna kidnap me? You were a threat to a very powerful man. Yeah, I used to work for him. He thinks I still do. Don't you remember? We were lovers. Is that familiar? No But it felt good. > On and on, the sea keeps rolling on j j» round and round my love keeps trying j j» you're the sea and I keep going down j j» like you're going down j aloha, Hawaii. It's Ava's I ove I ine coming to you exclusively on k-s-x-y radio and I'm still looking for long lost blondie. Blondie? Blondie, that's me! I hope you can hear us out there, blondie. Feeling better this morning? No, I feel like throwing up. But there is one good thing. What? I feel like myself. I have a special message for you today, blondie. The big kahuna you're with is not for you. Blind dates can be a bad idea don't trust him he'll raise cane if you give him a chance. We were never lovers I faked that orgasm. I hope you can hear me out there, blondie. Remember, your friends are out looking for you. We miss you. All right, we're almost to the beach. Keep your eyes open for the jet ski you saw. Okay. Get down! What the hell is that? That gyro that killed mika! Let's go. Come on! Donna! God, I'm so glad to see you. Get down! Ow! Throw your weapons in a pile and step back! Why should we? My weapons are now on automatic. If I let go of this button, you all die. I will now take the Jade, miss Hamilton. Has Kane lost his mind? All these killings over that stupid Jade Buddha? Oh, it's priceless. Thank you for your cooperation. I must leave you now. What was that little thing? A trigger to a nuclear bomb. I ook I ook! It's Kane I have the relay, Mr. Kane. I've disarmed the agents. What are you orders? Kill them That was for mika. My relay. Captain, prepare to go ashore. We have coastal patrol on the radar. Closing fast. Sir, we must withdraw. No, I must kill them. Please, they'll have another chance. But only if we leave now. Sir. Next time, Donna Hamilton. Next time, Mr. Kane. Get underway, captain. Top speed! Now! And here's one last message for blondie from the love line. Help is on the way and your hardships are over for now. The stars predict the beginning of a whole new era which can only be described as fantastic. So let the good times begin. Now, here's a song from our very own edy starke Kane will be back next time, I'll get him. Next time, we'll all get him.
