One dot one. One skinny headed south towards you. I'm counting at 10 armed militia, maybe more inside. Thank you, Max, keep your head down, mate. Go, go! I'll kill you, man! Take care of them two skinnies, Max. We don't want them bringing their friends to the party. Freeze, motherfucker. Where'd we fuckin' find these guys, mate. Well, good news is 12 grand for sunshine over there, yeah. And I believe we've got another main target in the bush, it's worth another seven, if we did, which I know we did, 'cause we're fuckin' good. Not a bad day in the office again, Max, well done. Over here, here's a lay down. Yeah. And what about them? We'll talk about that, mate. Their lives like their deaths. Not really worth much at all, is it? Why do you ask, Max, you're not having doubts are you, mate? Just asking. Run! See anything? - Nothing. - Keep scanning. Hammaford, Wilson, front, center, fire! Magpie, Notch, clear a path around back. Go, go! Mag, you got to take out the PKM mate, he's all over us, you copy? Come on! Goddam, Magpie. That was the most insane thing I've seen in my life. I'll take all of you. Okay, Max, got two runners heading toward the mosque. Hammaford, go with, go, go, go! Fuck! You'll meet him soon, soldier, you'll meet him soon. Psycho motherfucker. Get your rifle, let's go. I just watched you take out 13 motherfuckers. That first drink's on me. You want me to kiss the booboo? Hey! Don't worry about me, Max, I was so fuckin' bummed. Well, today was great fellas. Rich pickin's. Right, good work, Squad Leader alone, he was worth 20,000 buck-a-roonies, right. And I'd say we've got to bid another 70 or so grand worth of targets. Well done, lads. Here, mate. All right, guys, group shot. Come on, I'll put this one on Facebook. He's not serious with that Facebook thing is he? He's still tryin' to find a soulmate, boss. Come on, mate, aren't you done with that. All right, gather up, quick, quick, come on. Find that little lens right, you know how it goes. Let's go, boys. It's on a timer. One, two, three. Help me. Come here. Fuck you. Get you, fuck. You're gonna fuckin' love this, sh. You fuckin'. Sh, sh. You're safe now. You're safe. I'll get you out of here. Sh. Motherfucker! I'm gonna cut your fuckin' head off, legionnaire. Look at me, Max. Look at me, Max. Look at me, Max, look at me. Look at you now. Nice ring, I'll take that. Hey, did you see me get two men with one shot. Bullet went right through his head. I tapped him too. Two kills on the one shot. Yeah, we should be selling the shit ourselves. We'd make 10 times what they're makin' with the feds. Yeah, yeah, right. You try moving that stuff yourselves, be my guests. That's a more deprived path that we're on. Trust me on that, boys. Pack it up, let's move out in 20. Has anyone seen, Max. No, I think I watched him walk in this hut before it exploded. He's fuckin' dead. Wait a minute, mate. Wait a minute. What do you mean, you think he's dead? You're grenade... I watched him- - Max is my friend. I watched him walk in the fuckin' hut. Don't fuck with me. I watched him walk in this hut before it exploded. He's fuckin' dead. Then fuckin' look for him, perimeter search right now. He's another fuckin' grunt, who gives a fuck! Excuse me. Do you have problems taking orders, do you? You need to relax, boss. You need to do your job. - I will. - Off you go. Max, do you copy? Come on, Max. Max, copy if you could, over. Max would never leave it. You know that. What do we do, boss? Do we stay and look for him. Yeah, well, we've only got 20 minutes to settle up and haul this cargo, make the rendezvous. Max knew what he signed up for. High pay, high risk. Okay, grab what you need, let's move. Your fever finally broke. You had a very bad blood infection that was going to kill you. The doctor dressed your neck wound and gave you antibiotics. Your feet looked like they are sorely in need of a pair of sandals. You can have these if you'd like. Where are you going, huh? You have no idea where you are or where you're going. Welcome to my parish. I am Father Elias. May I show you around, hm? Come with me, please. Your feet, are you sure you don't want the sandals, hm? No? So, you take charity without offering anything in return, hm? The antibiotics cost money this church can't afford to spare. An honest man would want to return the favor, huh? I need this place swept, you do it and we're even. Hm? It's not complicated. You know it is said, I am a benevolent man. But I am also a practical one, my son. I'm not the kind to take charity from a stranger without giving an offer. You swept and I want to offer you something in return. No? I decided sleeping under my roof was on the house. I want to pay you back with a warm meal. If you refuse, you make me a dishonest man. That's a terrible thing to do to a priest. Come, my son. Let me see. Mm, Esther, Father Elias, a letter from the church. Ah. They want to know how the Wednesday night services are going. You wanted to be in charge of that. They'd like more attendance. But nobody wants to come. Why don't we tell everyone we'll be giving a free dinner, every Wednesday after the service, huh? Often you have to give something to receive. Yes, that's a great idea. I'll make my stew. Esther, perfecto. I will do that, Father. But are we not looking for a flock with a desire to pray not just to eat? Get them in here and in front of you, Father. Then it is your job to instill in them a desire to pray. Young priest, I'm hoping his mind ages well, like a good wine. Esther serves breakfast at 7:00. You need to eat. I'll need my church swept again tomorrow and you can pay me back for breakfast, hm. Are you able to talk at all? Can you write your name? Ah. Max. Well, God be with you, Brother Max. People choose to talk to me, to unburden themselves. They tell me everything, the teeniest to the sublime. When they genuinely want to keep their secrets, they look away from me the way you do. We didn't meet by chance. There was a reason as there is a reason for everything. I see you found Father Benedict's hiding place. That was his rifle. He would hunt feral pigs with it. Father Thiago replaced them when he died several years ago. Whenever he came home with a meal we would share it with our families. Please, put it back. I expect to see you at Mass this evening, hm. I would like you to open your Gospels to page eight, Matthew, the first chapter in the Gospel, verse 44. "But I say to you, love your enemies," "bless those who curse you." "Do good to those who hate you." "And pray for those who spitefully use you" "and persecute you." We are forced with this challenge in our town, every day, from these men who come down from the hills. They kidnap people and blackmail their families so they'll work in the jungles making drugs. You ask yourself why should I do good to those who hate me? Because that is what God asks us every day. That we may show these people that life and love exists. And in that action we may transform these people to become God's children as well. Eat, my son. Ah, gracias, Esther. - Hold still. - Wonderful, wonderful. Wonderful, let me taste, huh. Mm, Esther, the soup is exquisite. Someday, with God's grace, she will learn to make something other than stew, hm. Here, Father Thiago, welcome. I am suggesting, Father, that he's probably a dangerous man. He looks like a dangerous man. Frightening in fact. And it's not right he stays under our roof, and eats at our dining room table. And the scar on his neck? It's frightening people. Frightening, whom? Has anyone complained. Well, frankly, it's frightening me. Perhaps you're right. Father Thiago is concerned your appearance might intimidate our parishioners. So, if you wear this robe while you are here. You are not a priest, and you must not let people think you are. But you work for the church and I say it is all right for you to wear this robe. I hope you decide to stay. Have a good night, Max. Excuse me, Father. Excuse me, hello, he is not a priest, don't talk to him. Hi, my child, I am Father Thiago, I will answer any questions you may have. I told you she was gonna run! Ah, shut up, I know, I know, shut up! Hey, priest, where's the girl? Hey, my friend asked you a question? Where is she? Where's the girl? I've seen this before. It's what the Sinaloa Cartel does to chivatos. What were you, a snitch. That fuckin' explains everything. You know what, I'm hungry and so is he. Go get us something to eat, snitch. Oh, I'm sorry, priest. - You will be safe here. - Gracious, padre. We will protect you my child. Aye, please come. Gracious, padre. What are you doing? Don't feed them, are you crazy! We have to get rid of them, they can hurt us. This child is terrified. They tried to kidnap her but she escaped. What are we going to do? I will talk to them. He's encouraging them to stay? Fuckin' took long enough. Whoo, mm, mm. Do you bathe. Or does God just smell like shit? Mm, I smell it. That ain't shit. Oh yeah. It's piss. You fuckin' stink, priest. So does this fuckin' food. You fuckin' with me, priest. Fuckin' stand here and judge me. I'll gut you like a fuckin' pig, neck to nuts. Clean all this shit up. Let's get the fuck out of here. That was rather anticlimactic, wasn't it? Good morning. Today, we will not read from the book. But I would like to speak about a member of our church. He is someone I trust and I would like him to come forward so that I may share his wisdom. Max, Max. Through the use of nonviolence you saved the life of this young woman. We all live under the shadow of violence. But you faced two of the Silver Cartel's men and you weren't hurt and you didn't fight back. And that is a lesson for our class. How important nonviolent resistance is. It is. Is this really appropriate? I don't think it is. He can barely speak. - Ola. - Oh! I thought you said she wasn't here. We are about to have a lesson, may we offer you food? We tried that before, didn't we, snitch. There's no need for violence. I am Father Elias, I am the priest of this parish. I'm sure we can talk this out. Mm, you hide someone from us again, we make an example out of you first. She stays. She stays. Today Father Elias has asked me to talk to you about nonviolence. These men have weapons. 'Cause they like to bully people and they don't have confidence. I have no weapons. But I have confidence. All right now, you take her, I'll take care of him. Don't touch her. Oh. New man. I'm gonna fuck you up, priest. I'm sorry, Father. I understand, my son. - Can you teach me? - Teach me! - I want to learn! - Teach me! - And me! - I want to learn! That was very interesting lesson in nonviolence. I apologize for losing my temper, Father. We are all teachers and students in life. We all have something to learn and we've all learned something we can pass on. Maybe you could teach self-defense. Goodness knows we need it. I'm better at attacking than defending, Father. When I brought you here, that first night, you were so sick and near death, I gave you last rites. I didn't know your religion or even if you believed in a God at all. Maybe something in you did die that night and something was reborn. If you could teach others to protect themselves, is it not worthy? I see so much pain. I know it is God's will. But, I also know God wants us to help ourselves. Just shut up. What the fuck are you lookin' at? Count to fives, yeah. Check that one too. Shut up! So, There were six of 'em boss. The priests are very well trained. There are only two priests in that parish. We know where every man is within 60 miles. They surprised us. You think I'm a fuckin' idiot? Boss. I'm a professional soldier, yeah? I select and I train indigenous forces to kill their own. This means I have a rare insight to reading human condition. You understand? Ah, no. It means I know when someone's pissin' on my leg and telling me it's raining. No, fuck this. There was only one guy, boss, and he was not a priest. Yeah, well that was fuckin', no. What. That, oh no, this is the guy. That's the guy that was in the church. Well, no, this guy right here, he would have killed the both of you two, real fuckin' quick. Mercy must have left a bad taste in his mouth. That's the guy that I went toe to toe with, I swear. Oh, wow. All right, guy, will if a murderer was going to look for redemption, I guess a church might be the right place to go to, yeah. - Yeah, but we... - Max? He's dead, boss, we left him for dead. Yeah, we left, but we didn't see him, right? And now, we do have a problem. Mm-hmm, all right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magpie, put your gun on the table, please. You'll be all right, go on, right there. Yeah. If you can get that gun before I can get to mine and shoot me, well, you'll have your respect back. And these boys, they'll let you live, right guys. Go on. Boss. It's your own choice, mate. You sloppy, fuckin' lying cunt! See that? No exit strategy. Right, right? Yeah, but none other, not Max. What is going on? What is he up to? Why is he in my parish? Anyone, please help? All right. We have work to do. Here. Shoulder to that, yeah. Yes, boss. Go ahead, fuck off. So, have you done that a lot? You know, the whole? Father Thiago, whoever Max was before, he is no longer. Yes, of course, I mean no disrespect. What I mean to say is, I may be better with books than I am with people. When I saw you, I didn't see you the way Father Elias saw you, as a person. I made a judgment and I was wrong. I want to apologize. Max. As I live and breathe, you live and breathe too. I've never seen these people. Good afternoon, welcome to my parish. I am Father Elias, this is Father Thiago and this... And this is one of my best men. Oh, he's a killer, yeah. Best shot I ever had. Could kill a man from half a mile away. Has he told you how he murdered men, women and children. Only half of them deserved it. Well, I'll tell ya, out of all the places I thought you might leave me for, I got to be honest, mate. I didn't picture this. No, no, no, no, no. Tropical fuckin' oil, maybe some women, yeah sure. Dying in the gaming pits in Congo, yeah, sure. Come on, mate, you're not foolin' with this bullshit, are ya? And I knew you weren't fuckin' dead, I knew it. Yeah, getting soft, sure, maybe. But a priest? I'm not a priest. There's some things we can't wash clean now, can we? You attacked two of my men. You know the punishment for someone hurting one of my men? Of course you do, you're the one that used to carry it out. Look, Max hurt two of my men, which means I have to hurt two of yours. I'll give you a couple of minutes to make a decision. As a regional representative of the church, I have to inform you, that your threats are a violation to the National Civics Charter... As the regional representative of the Silver Cartel, I'd like to formally apologize, Father. I didn't intend on our first meeting ending with me killing you. You're fight is not here, LeClerc. Why are you fuckin' here? There's always a reason, mate. I know you, there's always a fuckin' reason. I'm just doing what I have to do to forget my past. Now wait a minute, mate. You're not here to see me, are ya? LeClerc, brother. Say the word, I'll make him my next notch. No, no, it's all good. All right, tell you what. I'll let all of this slide if Max joins me for dinner tonight, yeah? What do you say, mate? Good food, good drinks, we can sit down, have a nice civil conversation and maybe try to figure this whole thing out, right, Max? Tonight at 8:00. Father, Father. Whoever the fuck you are, mate. What are you doing? I shouldn't have stayed. If you hadn't helped that child they wanted, she would be dead. Max, you have given the people hope here. Do you realize that? Please, stay. We need you. If I stay, Father, all of you are in danger. So what can we do? You're a new man, maybe you can talk to him and not fight him. Good, good, good. Hey, gringo! When they told me, I didn't believe it. Reverend Max, a fuckin' false prophet. Stop. You know the drill. You know, I've seen you cave a man's head in with a shovel, Max. God has a special place for sinners like us. It ain't wearin' a backward front collar. There's five Gs, count that. There's another five Gs, roll it up. The Right Reverend Max to see you, sir. Always punctual, right, Max. Come on, have a seat, Max. Isabel, bring me that bottle, will ya, love. Mm, right. Thank you, sweetheart, very nice. Well, crab meat's all fresh. Listen, I'm really showin' what you wanted to eat, sir, it's all your choice, mate. I'm not hungry. Now listen to that. That's a little fuckin' rude, don't you think? I did invite you for dinner, didn't I? And all this, guy. What am I meant to do? Eat it all myself? Make me look like a fuckin' idiot, yeah, all right. Do you by chance remember that one night, mate? We barbecued that javelina in Juarez? Best fuckin' meal I've ever had. Til this fuckin' day, the best meal I've ever had. Oh, it's a good drop. Yeah. What do you want from me? Come on, mate. We're gettin' old, Max. You know how it goes, mate. Tick fuckin' tock, boom. No more chasin' those high-value targets. It's a young man's game that is. Here, I mean look at us, mate. We get to kill with impunity. Only one fuckin' spot and the money's fuckin' good. Really fuckin' good. Come back and join the team, mate. I'm sorry I hurt your men. I'd like to apologize about that. Just fuckin' go on, will ya. I don't give a fuck about him. Not a problem. But the big boss, yeah, he's askin' questions, all right. I mean, come on, Max. You can't just go beat the shit out of two cartel men, mate. What do you think, there's no show of rules, mate. Respect is everything, you know that better than anyone. Make me look fuckin' weak, you make the cartel look weak and so on. Fuckin' so on. You either join the team, or you leave fuckin' town, it's that simple. This is not who I am anymore. I want to live a simple life. And the people at the church, they're not your enemies. They don't want to fight you guys. I'll leave tonight and you'll never have to see me again. Fuck! What, is, fuckin', oh mate, I don't, I don't, for the church. You're all for the fuckin' church. Can you promise me you won't hurt them while I'm gone? Yeah, all right, fuckin' go, you're done. Get out of here. I'm beggin' you, please. Yeah, yeah, mate, no problems. I can't believe what I just saw. The great Max, turn into a sheep. No, I always knew he was a coward. Let me fight him, I'm better than he is. That's not the Max I knew. We don't know where he's going, who he's talking to. Yeah, well first of all I fuckin' know and second of all, who said you could fuckin' sit here! You think this fuckin' thing's for you? No, get out! Get everyone, get to fuckin' work. We'll take care of Maxie. You can keep the sandals, Max. You can give them to the next person who needs them. I don't think you should go. We need you. I made a deal with LeClerc and his men. They won't hurt you if I go. Absolutely not, I won't let you leave this way. This is what I am, Father. Who's that? The son of a bitch, stay here. - There he is. - Hey, Max. Don't move or I'll kill her. You know I will, don't you, Max. LeClerc, you promised. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know I did, Max. But see, I got thinkin', you know, started rolling it over and over in my head. And I realized something, mate. I realized I don't need the priests, I don't need the church and I don't fuckin' need you. Hit him, Wilson, hit him! - Kill him! - Get him up! Give into him. Let's fuckin' string this cunt right up, come on. - Dirty bastard. - Oh, come on. Hey Max. You betrayed me twice, brother. Yeah, well, the Lord protect me from my friends. My enemies I can handle, yeah. Put him up. Come on, put him up! And he's up, you want to put the first one in him. - Oh, it would be my pleasure. - Got one. Hold him tight! Give me your nail, Dix. Give me one, give me the next one. Yeah, good job, boys. All right, let's move. Hang in there, Max. I'm sorry, Max, I really am, mate. At the end of the day, it is just business, yeah. I'll see you around, brother. Goddam, you drive like a fuckin' grandma. Park it up at the head of the church there. Move it on, boys, we don't have all night. We've got work to do. Go! The fire of the Lord is smokin', his mystery's been unveiled. Hammaford, send in the 40 millimeter late. Man, I've been waitin' to do that. - Let's move! - Go baby! Father Elias! Thank God, you're alive. Can you stand? Max, come, come. I wasn't sure you'd wake up. The church, I'm sorry, Father. I have some more broth. They killed Esther and the two groundskeepers. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Father Thiago and I escaped to here. He went to bring you clean clothes. I have faith we can rebuild the church. Continue what we started. His men will kill you, Father. You can't go back. Then I will die doing God's work. Father Thiago says raids are happening every day in the village now. They are rounding up people to kidnap to work in the jungle factories or just kill. It is a reign of terror. 'Cause the church was inspiring people to fight back. The people in the village are victims. They're terrified. I will go back now. It's best I move at night. God be with you, Father Thiago. Would've been better if I'd just died, Father. No, Max, listen. When God saw you try to live peacefully, he smiled on it for a time. Then he visited fire and brimstone down on us. Maybe that's the message, huh? You are a weapon, Max, forged in fire. You might be the only thing that can stop what's happening. Maybe you should do God's work the best way you know how. Are you sure you are fit to run? Have to get fit to fight, Father. I wish there was a better way. Look it here. Location, location, location. - No shit! - Welcome, my friends. What the fuck are you doin' here? This where you keep the little boys, Father? This is my spiritual retreat. I come here to meditate, to find solace. This place is a fuckin' shit hole. God does not see it that way. I am preparing some soup, delicious. - Oh, we just ate. - I ate too. Don't want soup? Don't fuckin' move. Bread, huh? Everybody likes bread. Told you not to move. Oh shit. He was just going for his bread. Looks like we're both going to hell, brother. Fuckin' eh. Never did like priests. No, no, no! Father. You are a weapon, Max, forged in fire. You might be the only thing that can stop what's happening. Maybe you should do God's work the best way you know how. Wait a minute, just slow down, will ya. Eight men? Nine, nine men? They were shot with high velocity big game rounds. Shots came from outside and inside. Others were killed with blades, a machete maybe. Accurate strikes. It was a professional. A very, very skilled professional. Find him! Must be Max, it doesn't make any fuckin' sense. You had the chance to kill him up close. But you chose to do it at a distance because you couldn't face him. This mistake's on you, LeClerc. Come on mate, you were there. You saw his body in the chapel, right, I mean you were there. We blew the fuckin' church up! With a guy like Max, you actually have to cut his fuckin' head off! You're losin' your touch, LeClerc. Yeah, well, maybe you're right about cutting his head off. Mm-hmm, yeah, but. If you ever fuckin' tell me how to run my business again, and I'm gonna fuckin' eviscerate you. So help me fuckin' God. What I say when I say you get rich you're done, ya fuckin' die. Do you understand. Yeah. Don't move. This is not your fight. No need to die. If you pick up that pistol, I will kill you. Forget it, he's long gone. He's not here, he's close but he's not here. Come on Tex, talk to me. Did he say anything? They came 'cause of the gunshots. He was long gone by the time they got here. He shot these two and he kicked the shit out of these others. You didn't say anything, right. No. You know, why would ya. Come with me. Oh. Piss! Magpie! Keep it together. Where is he? Notch, cover fire! Everybody else, take positions. Where the fuck is he? He killed Magpie, the motherfucker killed her. Yeah, I know, I tell ya what. Anyone who kills this piece of shit gets an extra 100 grand bonus tonight. Right, we know he's here, we know he's alone. Let's fuckin' find him. I have a feeling he might even come looking for us. Where to now, boss. Back to the saloon, let's move, now! I want 10 men out here at all times, okay. No one gets in there unless I say so. You got it? Good! Ted, over there. Had to be fuckin' Mexico, that's right, couldn't have been one of you fuckin' blokes here. Could have killed one of you in a fuckin' heartbeat. 15 years on a SEAL team, boss, we don't die so easy. Oh yeah, really. He's been lucky, boss. But not today, today is his day. Today is his fuckin' day. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. That 100 grand's mine. Fuck your grudge and fuck your 100 grand. He killed Magpie. He's mine. Oh, not unless I get him first. And this time, I will chop his fuckin' head off so he doesn't come back yet again. And I'll put it outside on a fuckin' post. - Good. - Yeah, well if he is stupid enough to come back, we will kill him. All right, Wilson, inside front door. Hammaford, inside here. Notch, Rodriguez, you're with me. Oh, you fuckin' never die, do ya. All right, Willie Nelson with a gun. Let's go, come on. I'd like to surrender. You're gonna make me a rich man, son of a bitch. Yeah, go on. Hey boss, they found him. They're pullin' up in jeep outside. Well, wait a minute, who's got him? One of ours? Yeah, it's Jose, the fat one. - Dead or alive? - He's alive. Oh you fuckin' idiots. Stop the car and kill him, right fuckin' now, immediately! They're all fuckin' dead. From here on, I go in on my own. Shut up. Oh fuck me! Come on, Max. You think you're better than us but you're not! Shit! You killed Magpie! Oh, there he is. Always punctual, yeah. It was never about the money for you, was it Max? No, no, no, no, was for the others but not for you. You just do it because you like it, right? Well. Come on, get up! It was always coming to this, wasn't it. This is for Elias, motherfucker. You are leaving, aren't you? What will you do now? Some good I hope. Father Elias might have said something like, whatever you do, God will be with you. What would you say, Father? Me, I'd probably say something like, stop fighting and killing so much and just live a little. Goodbye, Father.
