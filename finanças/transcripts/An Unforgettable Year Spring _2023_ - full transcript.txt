I carry art in my blood. My grandmother carved her dreams in soapstone. Dreams my mother never understood. Why does one choose to be an artist? Is that freedom my grandmother always sought worth risking a life of hardship and frustration my mother always feared? BASED ON THE WORK OF BRUNA VIEIRA An Unforgettable Year SPRING Why do we do things even though we know we'll regret them? Knowing that everything we built with so much dedication can crumble? I didn't know this, but those drawings on the math test would change my life. MATH TEST My grandma used to say, "A little rebelliousness every now and then is important. "Like the rain. "It can even get in the way. But without it, nothing grows." Time's up! It's over! If you did it, you did it. Your test. It's over! - Your test? - One minute, teacher! I'm almost done! One minute is a lot. In one minute, 300,000 liters of ice can melt in Antarctica, 6,000 lightning bolts can hit Earth, and you, the future of mankind, can't solve an equation? It's the end of days. Your test. - Just one more minute, teacher. - Here's my test, Mr. Carvalho. I also find it unfair that some people get more time than others. Hey, Daisy... Rose? Camellia? Jasmine. Will you fail this year? That's 365 useless turns Earth has taken around itself. - Should I be worried about you? - You don't need to! If I'm not worried, you shouldn't be. I'm definitely worried. I would be too. Mr. Carvalho flunks seniors. Thanks. That helps. Answer to question one, X is more or less than 1.5. ARTIST TRAINING PROGRAM 328 divided by 3. I can't stand that girl. Look! She thinks she's the answer key. She always wants to get a higher GPA than you. - Your grades are better than hers. - Except math. Except math. - For the multiple choice, I'm sure it's A. - D. The answer was D. - No, girl. I'm sure I bombed it. - Relax! - Did you get it? - I guessed C. Back then, you'd guess D as in "divine," but I see this generation is more atheist. Excuse me. Let's go, Mine. No, for God's sake! Find a way to get back on track. Otherwise Alice will be the valedictorian. You know what that means. The biggest disaster ever! She wants to invite Keyboard Edson to play at prom. - Nina, relax. - This is unacceptable. Let's help save the Lightning Rod Fraternity. - I've got an idea. Come with me. - Hey, you're gonna live in a sorority! Help save Lightning Rod! We're in trouble today, it could be you tomorrow! Aren't you the guy from that band? Scrambled Eggs with Shells? Nice to meet you, I'm Nina. We really need someone to play at our graduation party. Nice to meet you! Sir Gregory. For the close ones, Greg. - Greg, let's go. - Wait, man! I'm closing a deal, don't be rude! My bad! It's okay. What song is this? It's an old one. A classic. It's my dad. - Hi, Dad. - How are you? - Hi, sir. - Hi, girl. Bye! Really? - Here's your change. - Thanks. - Have a good day at work! - Good to see you! How was the math test? Mom, I don't know. The whole class bombed it, okay? My daughter isn't the whole class. As far as I know, my daughter is the best. Mom, you're crazy. But Marlene said that even if you get 50%, you'd still have the best GPA of the class. You'll be valedictorian and all! You got 50% at least, right? Mom, I don't care about being valedictorian. - Leandro, do hear your daughter? - Relax, dear. At your age, I provided for the house. My mom couldn't pay the bills. Grandma was an artist. She wasn't recognized. My daughter, that's the world. People don't appreciate us for what we love to do. I, for example, love to dance. - I'd love to be appreciated for it. - I appreciate it. Look how amazing it's becoming. Look, we're putting shelves here. Over there, the cash desk. And all this space here is for us to assemble the arrangements. Hey, dear. Do you want to show her? Come here. This will be your office, baby. Not everyone who graduates from business school gets hired. And it's more than a job. It's a business that's also yours. Also, we registered you in the college entrance exam. You'd end up missing the deadline. Thanks, guys. - Let's go! - Let's go. When will you tell your folks that instead of business, you wanna study fine arts, huh? It's very competitive. And there's my parents, the shop... - No, it's not for me. - Oh, you. Nina, listen. Can you imagine my mom's face when I tell her I wanna trade college for a course at the museum? She'll say that I'll end up selling beads in a small town. Alexa, good morning. Good morning! Today is the spring equinox. The season of flowers. Time of rebirth, revolutions and growth. There's no harm in trying for the fine arts museum thing. It takes time, Nina. - "It takes time." - Look! - What is it? - It's your rockstar's friend. Is he listening to that song? It's stuck in my head and I don't know it. Eye contact. Play it cool. Act natural. - Tough climb? - What? - Tough climb? - This city is breathtaking. - You're going to math college, right? - Why? - Do I look so much like a nerd? - No. Imagine that. Just a guess. - Do you really prefer going up this slope? - Why? Because you could take the less steep side roads. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. The reality is different here in Ouro Preto. Math's an exact science. Location won't change it. "Math's an exact science..." OURO PRETO LABORATORY SCHOOL Here's your coffee. Thanks. - Sugar? - Mom? Close the door and have a seat, Jasmine. How shall we do this, sir? I'll have to ask you. You multiplied the species. The teacher is joking. So, she'll flunk, is that it? Mom, relax. I've still got two more tests. One! Just one more until the end of the school year. In theory, Hydrangea needs to get 100% to pass. I'm doing really well in other subjects. One of the best students. You can't be great if you don't know math. That's why there are bridges falling, rockets exploding... due to people like you, thinking the humanities are enough. Human beings should go through a selection process to be able to exist, frankly... - He's kidding. - No, I'm not! How can a person who got zero get full marks? It'll be a real challenge. There's no automatic approval. Not even for senior year. Since I'm magnanimous, what I can do for you is spare some of my precious time to try and put some math knowledge into Violet's mind. Jasmine. Due to the principal's request, what I can do is make room in my calendar for mentoring. What? She'll have sessions to clarify any doubts? - That's right. - Those doubts will become debts. Zero, Jasmine. You got zero! Do you know what that means? If you ask a plant at our shop to do the test, - it gets the same grade as you! - You don't have to be mean, okay? I won't flunk senior year. And if I flunk, that's it. What can I do? My daughter, what are you saying? We pay everything for you. Your only duty is to study! If you don't do your part, pay for this school and your things... Okay, Mom! I'm not a fool! No more privileges. If things go south, I'll sell my art like Grandma. Interesting. I'd never thought of reading this book like this. Hi, I'm Davi. Jasmine, right? - Are you stalking me? - Do you need to get 100% in math? Are you here to teach me? - What about Carvalho? - You're already there. I have grandiose calculations to prevent humanity from taking large steps towards its total destruction. And that's why I assigned my best pupil to the inglorious task of making you study. - Hi, I'm the pupil. - Don't let me down, okay? I don't accept anything less than 100%. Or else... Jeez, she'll flunk. It'll be all right, okay? Last year, I was a senior. It'll be easy to remind you of the concepts. How do I remember them if I never learned? We can start reviewing the questions you had the most difficulty with. I don't wanna see this test again. I made this test for Mr. Carvalho. I loved your drawings. It's the prettiest test I've ever seen. You should frame it, you know? Let's schedule our classes? Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4 p.m. Mondays at 4:30 p.m. Wednesdays, I need to confirm. Fridays, we can... All week? I thought it would be twice a week at the most. I have other activities, like a life. I'm on a college scholarship and I need this internship. You need to pass senior year. Maybe it's time to check your priorities. - You'll talk about my priorities too? - No. I'll tell Mr. Carvalho this won't work. You got other plans, prefer another mentor. That's fine. You have a gift, man. A rare gift. Do you wanna waste your talent on high school students? Most will never understand the subject. They hate math and people who teach it. - What theory is this? - Not a theory. It's a fact. - And it's really pitiful, okay? - No! Jeez, this thing is really bad. I'm working on my challenge to get into Prisma Lab. Leave me alone. The mentoring's distracting you. You're distracting me, man! And get up from my bed. Seriously, Greg. I really need this job at school to keep me here. Someone has to pay the bills! Since a certain band hasn't played in a while. We're on a creative break. - Creative break? - That will end soon. We'll do a super show at the end of this year. Like Rock in Rio Lisboa, only in Ouro Preto. - Are you talking about the graduation? - Yes. Giovana, I was thinking... Of course, the invitation has to be velvet. Classy, serious, elegant. Girl, I think so too. To match the curtains of the colonial palace. And we're hiring Keyboard Edson. There you go, Gi! Hold on, that was still up for a vote. Aesthetic decisions are made by the sovereign commission. Yes, Jardim Bauxita, the missing one. Did you lose something there? - No. - You're obsessed with high school, huh? - Come on! - Be careful. Girl, I think this ribbon dance should be updated. - Add some steps like this... - Stop being crazy, Nina! Look! Elegance. You either have it or you don't, right, Gi? Alice, this teasing thing is so fifth grade, don't you think? My dear, you want a band called Cheese Omelette, while I want glamour, velvet, black tie... - It's not a matter of opinion. - It's Scrambled Eggs with Shells, okay? Can you believe I agree with Alice? It's not a matter of opinion. You want a tacky party, but we want a fun party. - That's a tough choice, right? - Right? Jasmine? Hi! - Are you still studying, honey? - Yeah. I'm just revising. - How are those extra classes? - Great. Everything under control. You can be honest with me. You can tell us anything, okay? Hey, Dad. Is the life you have today the one you imagined at my age? I think so, honey. And I'm very happy with our family. - With our achievements. - Was it your dream to sell flowers? If you were to ask Leandro as a teenager, his dream was to be a Formula One driver. - Dad, come on! - You see? That was everyone's reaction! People laughed at me. When everyone tells you that your dream is impossible, you realize you have to work with what you've got. - Got it. - But one thing fulfills me. It's knowing that my work allowed my daughter to have better options than her parents. I can't go faster than 37 mph with my van, but I work with my favorite people in the whole world. So... What's the rush? Students will be called in order of their GPA. I thought of placing people like this. With the best students seated upfront. Alice, what's this about calling students in order of their GPA? It's just to recognize their academic merit. It's silly to turn our graduation into a competition. You'll do fine. I mean... if it weren't for math, you could even be valedictorian. I don't care about being first. Much less being valedictorian. - I'm glad I care then. - You really do! She's practiced since junior year. - Really? - Really! You're so cute. Can you give me a sneak peek of it? I can't wait until graduation day. Sure! "We don't want to be just one among many. "But rather, to be someone among many." That's so deep! Is it from The Little Prince? Done. It's beautiful! I'm a masterpiece. True, but now I'm done with it. I'll have to study on my own. Did you find out the name of that song Davi was listening to? I didn't. I was embarrassed to ask. That song was stuck in my head like gum. Hey, look on the bright side, now you can stick with me. Soon, I'll be going to New York to study fashion. And the young lady will miss me. - Enjoy it while it lasts. - Stop it. Have you ever thought that the world as we know it is ending? Yeah, maybe I have another year to go. Come on, Jasmine. All right, guys. So, if X is equal to one, Y is equal to... Anyone else? Me! No one? Anyone... You. It's... 100? - Negative one. - Negative one. I need your help. So, if three's to the power of two, to the power of Y, what should we do about the exponents? We should add. No, wait. Let's backtrack. No, Davi, sorry. It's not you, it's me. I can't do it. Jasmine, relax. - No one deserves to flunk senior year. - The way things are, it's for the best. Look, I'm sorry, but I wanted to at least try to get into the fine arts museum. The deadline is this week. I haven't signed up yet. I know the chance is one in a million, but I wanted to at least try. I totally get it. I've been trying for months to solve a math challenge. The competition is crazy. It's for the most amazing math and tech lab in Latin America. Here's what we'll do. We got another 20 minutes. Focus on your sketch. I'll take your notebook with me to correct it. Starting from next class, totally focus on math. Promise? I promise. Deal. Davi? The mural is ruined. I tried to fix it, but... LIGHTNING ROD FRATERNITY It's worse than I thought. At least I was proactive. Do you think this can be saved? FRATERNITY LIGHTNING ROD Is anyone here in love? Who? Me? Are you crazy, Greg? This won't happen. I won't risk my scholarship or my job for anyone. Even if that person is mature, talented, determined... beautiful. I see. LIGHTNING ROD FRATERNITY So? It looks like a dream. - I know where you got those ideas. - Are you gonna say there's math here? Maybe inspiration is a result of the things we've experienced. You did it without drafts, right? Like life. Hi! What if we had class today in a different place? Come on, Davi! Did you gain powers with that dyed hair? Almost there. You see? It's always "almost there" here. We've walked for almost an hour and nothing. Jasmine! Is there time to give up this outdoor class? I can't hear you. Come, Davi. It's warm! Come on! Come in, it's not that cold! You said it wasn't cold. And you said math wasn't so complicated. And it's not. - You've seen it. - Right. Seriously, you've been doing math calculations. When you dived in, when you chose to take side streets instead of the hill slope, and when you sketched on your math test. What's the point of making math seem so unattainable? I want to teach in a way that breaks that stereotype. But you can. When I say the word scientist, what image comes to your mind? An old white man. It's important to understand where they wanna put us, so we can decide where and how we wanna be. Have you decided? I wanted... I wanna be an artist. You already are. My parents already have a life plan drawn up for me, you know? When I went to college, my folks didn't get what I was doing. They told everyone I'll be a doctor. - What? - Nothing. You're supposed to be doing the exercises. - I did. - Let me see. I like it! Can I keep it? Let's do this. If I pass senior year, I'll gift it to you. Okay, I'll want it signed. It'll be worth a lot one day. I have a question for this exercise. - See? Classes like this are much better. - Something different, right? Better than the library. All classes will be at the waterfall. I'll think about it. Here. Nice place. You're home. Jasmine, I... - I want to tell you something. - Me too. The thing is... It's... We need to redo the functions exercises in the workbook, okay? Okay. We'll do that in the next class. - Mine? - Hi, Mom. - Jasmine, what's that? - What, Mom? You became a walking rainbow without telling me anything. - Come here, let me check this. - My hair will grow again, okay? That's not the point. You didn't talk to me about it. - We used to be friends, remember? - We still are... I'm just a little bit nervous about this math test. - Really? - Really. What about that hair? Circus cotton candy mix. - Whose attention did you want to get? - No one's. Tell me, don't you like it? You can tell me. You like it! Stop, girl. You really are something! Now I look like one of your flowers. The most difficult to deal with! But also gives me the most joy. Makes my garden more complete. Wow! Who's that girl? - Do you like it? - No, I love it! You're even more beautiful. I don't know how, but you are. Thanks. Nina, I got something to tell you. Sit. Wait. Gossip? I love it! - Don't tell anyone. - Let me guess! You and Davi are... - Nina! - I love it. But I didn't, girl. We had a connection, but then nothing. I'll see what happens today. I'm loving this couple! - You even have a theme song! - Which I have no clue what it is. Nina will find out. Wait. This is very important. Take the gum, girl. Nina, I told you it's not gonna happen. Girl, you never know! It's always good to be prepared. Hi, Jasmine. Today's my turn to suggest taking our class elsewhere. You in? ARTIST TRAINING PROGRAM REGISTER HERE I can't believe this. You were taking too long. You'd have missed the deadline. Can you believe my mother said the same when she signed me up for business? But now I'm actually happy. I've signed up! Now I have to fill in all this, prepare the presentation for the board... - And graduate, right? - Imagine studying in a place like this. I've been here a few times, but... Now it feels real, you know? It's not intangible anymore. People always made me believe that art was for others. The rich, the chosen ones. In a way, having failed math and being here today made me understand what I want in life. - One challenge leads to another. - I'm already anxious. So... now it's goodbye, math, goodbye, Davi, goodbye, business school. Hi, fine arts! Look, math, I don't quite know you, but I really appreciate you. Thanks to a friend. Shall we study a bit? Okay. So, X and Y are the legs of the right triangle. - Yes! Another one, come on. - Okay. This one... X is equal to three? No... Jasmine, relax. You're getting better every day. If I don't get all the questions right, I'll flunk senior year. And now, more than ever, I need to pass. I know, but to do that, you need a little more patience. Easy for you to say. No, it's not. I'm the most impatient guy in the world. And are you impatient about something? Yes. Like what? Solving that challenge from Prisma Lab, for instance. And what else? Mine! Girl! - I got something to tell you. - Me too! I'm... You first. My US visa was approved! I've officially applied for the Artist Training Program! Wonderful! Perfect! Of course you'll make it. Wait! I really want it. But I still have to present to the board. It's very competitive! There it is. What's wrong? My little warrior! - Let's go! - Let's go. - I'm so happy. - Me too. Look... I'm there for you, okay? Do you need a live model? I'm here. You can use me and abuse me. I'm all yours! Good afternoon. Good afternoon! Delivery from Jasmine Flower Shop. - Thank you. - You're welcome! Have you told the authorities? No, not yet! Give me a break. Come on, I'll give you moral support. What's going on here? But you gotta fix it, so we can paint and open the shop. I'm losing money! Hi, Mom, do you have a minute? Actually, I don't, but go ahead. - You know the art museum in Brumadinho? - Yes. They have this Artist Training Program... Artist training... Is it a college? Young man, look at the project to install the air conditioner, okay? It's just... Mom, let me explain something to you. It's not a college, but it's a very distinguished course. You know how it is, right? Everyone there is set for life. Heirs, rich families... Most don't even have talent. Not you, baby. You have a chance to go to college. - Me and your father didn't have that. - But what if it's my calling? Calling for ruin, you mean. You learned nothing from Grandma. Don't say that about her. Mine is saying she's gonna work really hard... Girls, one in a million will succeed as an artist, the rest will starve. Or they'll rely on someone, be resentful for life. People who sell beads on the street are all artists. And people say, "Art is freedom." There's no freedom without a paycheck! So, Jasmine is going to business school, end of conversation. - Right, Nina? - Sure! So excuse me, money doesn't grow on trees. I mean, ours does. Thanks for the support. You helped a lot. Girl... She's very convincing. She really gets inside our heads! Now I get why you don't wanna tell her you wanna sell beads. Better to laugh than cry, huh? Let's get rid of this. I think it's too much. And this one at the beginning, I'll ask you to move it to the end. And it will be our challenge question. - Don't you think it'll be too hard? - You know the saying. No pain... - No gain? - Go study humanities. The overall number of questions is good. Very well done. The right number of equations. This one with the figure too, the challenge question goes here. Hey! Earth to Jasmine. - Yes. - Didn't you have something to tell me? - No way! - Nina, you can't tell anyone! - Good morning, guys! - Good morning! This is... - Douglas. - Davi! Silence! Anyway, my pupil. He's preparing your test questions. If anyone has a problem, talk to him. Thank you. See you soon. Let's go back to yesterday's question. If N stands for the number of non-empty subsets of the set formed by multiples of five lower than 40, what's the value of N? 125. No. 127? Correct. 127! All right, class. That's it. Let's open our books to page... one hundred and eighty-two. What's up? - We need to talk. - I can tell it's not good news. Tell me. Jasmine, I like you. I really like you, but it's all very complicated. There are rules, there's Prisma Lab and Mr. Carvalho. Since we met, I can barely focus on my challenge. - So it's my fault? - No. I'm completely responsible. I shouldn't have let it get to this point. I should've ended it. Fine. You're right. We have more important things to focus on. We better stay away from each other. - Right. - I'll manage on my own. JASMINE FLOWER SHOP - Good morning. - Is this new? Yes, it is. - How about it? - It's beautiful! Come again soon. Good morning, honey. Your mom left early for the shop, but she left these flowers for you. She said it's to inspire you for today's test. You'll ace it. Dad. I need to tell you something. But you must promise me you won't tell mom. I'll tell her. As soon as I pass this test. Tell me, honey. I've applied for the Artist Training Program at the fine arts museum. My God. What kind of training? - Artist training? - It's not a degree, but it's known for positioning artists very well. Your mother won't like any of this. Sometimes, I feel like she doesn't see me, you know? Mine, you have to understand the hardships we've been through. College is a privilege! Your mother suffered because of your grandma. The hardships she went through when she was younger hurt her too much. - I know, Dad. - Ms. Alélia was... a talented sculptor, but she was never really acknowledged. - But this doesn't need to repeat itself. - I know, baby. But your mother may not know. And maybe she's just too scared. TEST Good luck! Confident, young lady? As much as I can be. Insecurity is the reason why humanity is facing extinction. You may begin! When a question seems too easy, be careful. It could be a trick. The order of operations makes all the difference. Hierarchically speaking, you must multiply first. You don't need a ladder to measure a tree's height. You can use the shadow. If the question has direct proportionality between magnitudes, apply the rule of three. Solving a logarithm is simple. Equal X, then leave everything on the same base. It's over! Time's up! Let's hand over the tests. Hey, time's up. It's over. Excuse me. Your test? So? Hi, I'm thinking a lot about you... About the test. I wanted to know how it went. Let me know, okay? Answer to question eight is N = 200. The multiple choice answer is... It's B. B! Answer to the challenge question is eight. - It's nine. - No. I'm sure it's nine. No way. Jasmine is gonna get 100% in math! 100%. I'm so happy! Are you finally gonna open up to Ms. Ingrid? I will. But first, I gotta share this victory with someone else. Giovana? Do you know if Jasmine is dating? Girl, I don't know, but I'm loving her style, seriously! Her hair, her clothes... It's amazing, right? Right? - So? - I think I got it all right. - Even the challenge question? - Nine? - You made that hard, huh? - I was afraid you'd get that wrong. Thanks for everything. I admit I was very upset when I saw it. It's not about me, you know? If Jasmine had information that the other students didn't, it wouldn't be fair, right? Nor ethical. And there's that romance thing. Something's not adding up. How can someone so focused as... - Davi? - my pupil risk everything over such a primitive reaction? Love's a chemical reaction. Love works in mysterious ways. Reason knows it all, young lady. Can we go back to what really matters? I'll look into this matter right away before it gets out of hand. Thank you. Do you know what that's called? A snitch. I knew we'd graduate together. Nothing's more important than choosing a look for this! Let's make this party more elegant. I got a surprise for you. What's that? - Girl, you didn't have to. - Yes, I did. Yes, you did. Girl... The world as we know it is coming to an end, I really wanted you to keep a bit of it. And a bit of me with you. Look. Hello? Yes, that's me. Tomorrow? Noon? Yes, of course! Thanks! "Yes, of course"? I got chosen for the interview! - No way. - Way! Girl! That's awesome! - I don't know what to say. - Me neither. How can you let yourself be fooled like this? I thought you were smarter. - Nothing happened! - Nothing happened? - I fell in love, Carvalho. - "I fell in love..." I fell in love, but I pushed it away. Love's nothing but an adrenaline charge that confuses our senses. She got 100%. Wasn't that the goal? I came up with a method to help students stuck in math. Come on. You honestly think she'd go from 0 to 100 just like that? I didn't show her anything. For a person who wants to hold a teaching position, you were very naive. Even though you didn't show her anything, it doesn't mean she didn't see anything. Okay. She's here. Thank you. Hi, Mom. - I must tell you something. - Where were you? Remember that fine arts program I told you about? I've applied for it. Fine arts? With what's happening at school? What do you mean? Don't lie to me, Jasmine. Please! Lying? I'm not lying. I'm opening up to you. All that effort to pass the test gave me more confidence to follow my dream. What effort, Jasmine? I really believed you were studying! But you were with the mentor Mr. Carvalho got for you. Dating in secret? - Peeking at the answer sheet? - What? I thought I'd raised you with more values, honestly. I didn't cheat on any test, Mom. I studied. And guess what, I learned! Okay! There's a school meeting tomorrow. Tomorrow? But I have the museum interview tomorrow! Jasmine, wake up! There's no museum! You'll flunk this year for academic fraud! Marlene said there's proof of what happened. And Davi is going to be fired. Oh, my God! Poor Davi. Mom, all of this is so unfair! Jasmine. Come back here, Jasmine! Davi! Davi, are you there? Davi! Hi, Greg. Is Davi there? - I need to talk to him. - You should go. - Can I at least talk to him? - You can't. Okay? - Don't you know? - What? Davi was expelled from the school monitoring. - And he lost his scholarship. - That too? He might lose Prisma Lab if they want to do more. Greg, he didn't do anything. I think you better leave. Really, Jasmine. For Davi's sake. Just go. Davi! Davi! Davi, please! We have to talk to Mr. Carvalho. - We can try to explain. - Explain what? How do you explain the challenge question? It was a sinusoidal graph which you never got right. - You peeked at my notes? - What? You could have seen the answer sheet. You saw it. Say it. Are you accusing me? Is this for real? You don't trust me, but you should trust your teaching skills more. Instead of letting your insecurity make you say such nonsense. What's going on, honey? What are you doing? Jasmine, stop! Stop this, Jasmine! I've stopped, Mom. I've stopped. I'm sorry. I screwed everything up. I tried to fight against this future everyone planned for me. And look where it got me. It's like it was just to prove everything you've told me. There's no point in dreaming! There's no point in hoping that things will change! They won't! Don't say that, baby. You are right! We better get used to it. So I don't end up like Grandma. - Like me. - Don't say that, Jasmine. Please, baby. Look... We'll take care of this, okay? We'll take care of everything. But we must do it together, baby. We must do it together. Don't be like that, I'm here. We have gathered the board and come to a conclusion after an evaluation. Unfortunately, Jasmine, the only option we have is to cancel your test. But I've already told you, Davi didn't show me anything! If she's saying she didn't cheat, she didn't. She can't fail the test. Is there a makeup test? Makeup tests are only for absence, not fraud. Please. We're still looking for the best solution. But can't she try to prove her innocence? We have talked to the monitor, we got all the evidence, and no one got the challenge question right. Not even that girl, the hardworking one, the snitch. I don't get it. You prefer to believe I cheated? What kind of proof do you have? For God's sake! Let me prove that I didn't need to cheat! Mr. Carvalho, ask me anything about the content. Let me try to solve it. - Principal, that's not how it works. - I've always been a good student. Is that worth nothing? That's true. Teachers, she deserves to clarify this situation as fairly as possible. You'll flunk this year for academic fraud! How do you explain the challenge question? - Are you accusing me? - No more privileges. It was a sinusoidal graph which you never got right! College is a privilege! Mr. Carvalho flunks people in senior year. - Senior year. - Should I be worried about you? It could be a trick. Math's an exact science. You said math wasn't complicated. Now, more than ever, I need to pass. No one deserves to flunk senior year. Insecurity is the reason why humanity is facing extinction. It's important to understand where they wanna put us, so we can decide where and how we wanna be. It's super correct. Super correct! I shouldn't have doubted your intelligence nor your moral integrity. This is the first time I didn't flunk anyone in senior year, even though it gives me a genuine unexplainable pleasure. But this time, I'm not frustrated. And I'd like you to be magnanimous and... And... forgive me. Look, I can forgive you, but you must do the right thing. You must return Davi's position at the school. Unfortunately, my pupil has returned to Rio de Janeiro and... even if I wanted, he can't come back to work here. I see. Congratulations, young lady! - Mr. Carvalho, everything is fine? - Yes. I just need a glass of water and to take a deep breath. I'm thirsty. Girl, what about that interview at the fine arts museum? It's today at noon. I won't make it. The hell you won't. If you run, you can make it. Let's go, honey. I'll drive you. - Where you going? - I'll take her to the interview. It's no use, Dad. I should've prepared something. With all this, I don't have anything to present. No way! Nina knows what you're gonna present. Dad, didn't you wanna be a driver? It's your chance to drive faster than 37 mph. Is it here, honey? Go on, honey. God bless you. All right? Sorry I'm late! I'm Jasmine! I'm so sorry, - but we've already finished. - No, please. - Have you brought your material? - I've brought this. It's Ouro Preto as seen through my memories, my love... It's everything that inspires me in my city. These things have always helped me endure and keep dreaming. A dream that's not only mine. One that's in my roots, and one that I must carry on. You are talented, but we already have several talented candidates. We're looking for something different, you know? Do you have anything else to show us? No, unfortunately. That's a shame. - Shall we go? - Yes. I loved your drawings. It's the prettiest test I've ever seen. You should frame it, you know? Wait. I have one more thing! How was it? I got in, Mom. Good job. Mom, the last thing I wanted was to disappoint you. Look at this. My drawings as a child. You kept them. I was the one who disappointed you. Everything I've been through... Those difficulties left a mark. You look so much like your grandma. She left without knowing how proud I am of her. And of you. Be happy with your choices, my angel. Congratulations, honey. Your joy is our joy, silly! I love you so much. So much. I love you. My beautiful flower. - Ready for the velvet curtains? - And Keyboard Edson? - No. - We tried, right? Jasmine? - What do you want, Alice? - I wanna talk to her. May I? I'm sorry. I really thought you'd looked at the answer sheet. But I was wrong. You deserve to be the valedictorian. - She's always deserved it, right? - Hi, girls! - Jasmine, your hair looks amazing. - Thanks. You look great too. Thanks. Shall we take our seats? Yes. Hey, Alice. Since it matters so much to you, why don't we give the speech together? - Really? - Really? Yeah. Thank you, Jasmine. On one condition. Can we still include a band for the party? I can't believe it! - Again, that nonsense band. - Do you want to give your speech or not? We don't want to be just one among many. But rather, to be someone among many. Not that we weren't someone before, but now it's our time to change the world. We've discussed a lot about the order in which we will call the students. - By their grades, alphabetically... - And we came to a conclusion. Randomly! Because a certain math teacher taught us that life is a randomness of events. Bia, who has everything to be an excellent psychologist! Marcelo, our soccer talent. Patrick, who will be an oceanographer. Eliana, our computer genius. Rubens, who's going to cooking school. Carlos, who's deciding between history and odontology. Felipe, the future cardiologist. Nina, our brilliant future stylist. Don't forget us when you're in New York, Nina! I won't. Giovana, our future successful lawyer. Alice, our future biomedical engineer. Jasmine, the best student in class and also an artist. Beautiful! And now, it's time for our school representative. Carvalho! Carvalho! Well, I haven't prepared a speech because I'm not used to being honored. And I'm not going to wish you luck, because life is a series of random events, like our dearest Daisy said here. Jasmine. I always knew it was Jasmine. Thank you, senior year. From the bottom of my heart, I want you to be... very happy. Got my feet on the road We'll see each other someday I know nothing will be as it was, tomorrow What news of my friends will they give me? They're awesome, you see? Thank you so much. This really is my dream graduation party. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow A taste of the sun remains in the night's mouth I'm gonna touch up my makeup. I look like a panda, right? Be right back. Hi. - I thought you were in Rio. - I was. I went to do an interview at Prisma Lab, Jasmine. I got in! Congratulations! I came to get my stuff. I was going to the bus station, but... Greg mentioned he was coming here, and... I see. Jasmine, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. I'm sure about that. You came here just to apologize? It was important to me. I also came to congratulate you - on getting into the fine arts program. - Good evening! I hope you're enjoying Scrambled Eggs with Shells concert. This concert for us is like... Like a concert. And I'd like to invite your classmate, the marvelous Nina! Hi, everyone. I'm gonna play a song that I'd like to dedicate to these two stubborn lovers, who are broken-hearted. - Let's do it, Greg? - Hit it. One, two, three... She figured it out. That was the song playing when we first met. I only remember your dad's van horn. I'm joking. If I close my eyes, I remember every detail from that day. Do you really have to go? Yeah. But I have a minute. A minute is a very long time. Mr. Carvalho! Shall we? I can't stand the mating dance! I got into the Prisma Lab thanks to your mural. I got into the fine arts program because of your test. You have to leave, right? I do. Girl... It's over. But it was worth it. ONE SPRING LATER That's beautiful, Jasmine. Thank you. These curves are inspired by the paths of Ouro Preto. Where the smallest distance between two points is never a straight line. You? I just got here from Rio. Prisma Lab sent me to do research in a college in Ouro Preto. - Ouro Preto? - Yeah. What are the odds? Do I need to calculate? An Unforgettable Year SPRING
