Excuse me. Do you have a light? - Let me see here… - We'll deal with that later. Do you know of any nightclubs? You fucking idiot. It wasn't on purpose. - That's perfect. - But maybe we'll see each other. Good bye! Old guys in suits are so easy. Unbelievable. - Did that old dude turn you on? - He was actually pretty fine. Should we try to find him again? Help him find his car? - It's always a pleasure to work with you. - Thank you. - Friend rate. - Thanks! Ciao. Hello. Okay, hold on. It's Jimmy. - Hello? - Hi, it's Jimmy. - I'm on my way, and everything is ready. - Okay, call when you arrive. Bye. I'm sorry! I didn't see you. Are you okay? Hello? Please wake up.

I talked to Peppe and he told me ecstasy. - This is ecstasy powder. - That's the best. I won't know until I've tested it, but it's going to be a different deal now. I have to check it, portion it out. More people have to work on it, the money's not the same. It'll still be a pretty penny. Don't worry. I don't want to be that guy, but… This is your deal, your thing. I'm… You know that I'm here for… The money. I know you're here for the money. Jimmy is here for the money. Let's have a cigarette… Relax a bit… Here. They tell me that these new rules say you're not allowed to smoke indoors. Jimmy, let's ignore those rules. - Yeah. - Here. I have no money for you today, I don't have the money you want. Primarily because you didn't bring me tablets. But you can get a little pocket money. You know that I'm… Well, I… - I have a lot to do. I have to… - You get ten grand now. And then we'll talk in a few days. Wait a minute. Peppe! There. Now everything is copacetic. - Hello, baby. - Well, hello yourself. - How are you? - Good. What's on your mind? There's this guy I do some minor business with. Jimmy. Rocker. - Yes, I know a Jimmy. - Right. What's his deal? Yes, I know. I'll be there soon. I'm on my way right now. I know, but some stuff came up… Listen, can I call you back? Okay, bye. - Hi. - You were supposed to be here yesterday. I know, I was going to fly, and then my buddy needed the car… I'm working, and I'm in a rush. I should have been at Slussen three minutes ago. Can't we see each other tonight? Maybe, if I have the time. - Maybe my phone will run out of battery. - I have an extra one. Ok, Jim Jones. Time to tell me what's really going on. What boat did I miss? Well… You know Kricke. He started dealing serious stuff a few years ago. Yes, unfortunately. Last winter, when he died, a friend from Amsterdam called. His name is Jochum. - He asked if I had connections. - And your answer was…? Of course I have connections. Do you realize who you're dealing with? Dragan. Do you know who Dragan is? I don't think you do. Come on. Let me tell you: Lady Gaga is Illuminati. - I don't believe that. - You don't? Shall we prove it? The last time she performed. In the background were all of the Illuminati symbols. It symbolizes their brainwashing. Like Jay-Z, Beyoncé, all of them. You know what's hard to tell? If she's a man or she's a woman. I don't know! Yeah, but the balcony is cold. But we're Jamaican. We'll smoke the weed on the balcony. - Next time. - Smoke weed on the balcony? Give me the lighter. What's the matter? Don't look at me like that. Have you thought about something? Who benefits from you dying? You're so fucking bitter. Say something positive, damn it. I thought he seemed alright. They're Balkan, and those guys keep their promises. Yes, to each other. They keep their promises to each other. You would have done it too. Yes, you would. No, I wouldn't have brought it to Dragan, and left with ten grand and a pat on the shoulder You get me? No. - Is she nice? - I barely know her, but she seems great. - Exciting. - I know she's a cool chick. I hope you have a good time. Here we are. Here's the building, number 54. 56. - There we go… That comes to 168 crowns. - Here's 500. - Let me just get change. - Keep it. Thank you, and good luck. Take care. Bye. Hi. What's this? What does it say? So what's this? Feels like that's what's going on. Here. - So it'll be in the summertime. - So where are you headed now? - Cyprus, two weeks. - Two weeks in Cyprus. Damn. Swimming and sun… I talked so much I got lost. My car is somewhere here. Take care. See you around. Yes! Thanks a lot. See that one? It looks just like a fox. That's one ugly fox. Foxes aren't ugly. I love foxes. - Why do some blades have holes? - Well… I've just had sublets for the last two years. So…I'll be homeless soon. That's not good. I'm looking. So come with me. What do you mean? I haven't really thought about it, but… What the hell… Come with me. To some warm country. What? Like Thailand? No way, Thailand is full of Swedes. - Mexico. - Mexico? Relax, you just got here yesterday. I want some margaritas, some tequila… Take it easy, and we'll see what happens. okay? We'll see what happens. The Russians are rough to deal with, they're such a hassle. All the time. You say A, and they give you B or C. - It's never A. It's B or C. It's annoying. - What's the problem? You know, they're being difficult. Sure, I'm pulling in tons of cash, but… - That's rough as well. - Excuse me. Hello? - Hello, it's Jimmy. - Hi there. Hi there. - I want to know about the money. - It's coming. It's all fine, it'll just take a few extra days. - But you promised. - They had to take a little trip up north. I'll explain when we meet face to face. I don't have time for you now. Okay? But, you know… Another problem. This guy from Malmö. Steals a car, hits an old lady, brings his problems to me. He doesn't know how much trouble he's in. He's wanted now. I have a plan. He left the stuff with me, now we just wait for the cops to grab him. - Yeah, of course. - Let's toast to that. - Which spliff is mine? - The big one is mine. That can't be yours. Look, we just lit my spliff. You argue too much about weed. Smoke and be merry. No problem. - Is anybody supposed to come visit? - I'm not expecting anybody. Go look. - It's one of us, a brother. - Let the brother in. Hi. Tomas Lindblad, Scania Police. I'm looking for Leo Hermansson. - I have to go to work now.

When I saw the policeman come in, I was so afraid, I nearly died. - Hi, Leo. - Hi. I'm looking for a guy called Jim Jonsson, He's supposed to be a friend of yours. - I have no idea. - You did time together.

You only have me? And you forgot to tell me you murdered someone on the way here.

Down Biblioteksgatan Street and then turn right. You can't miss it. Yeah, yeah, yeah… STOCKHOLM'S BODY PAINT COMPANY Hey there! Yes, come on in. - Hello. - Good, Jimmy. Come sit down. Here's the key. - What was that? - The key. I was noticing this coffee stain. Some fucker put his coffee down here. And didn't move the coffee. Coffee… - I'm here to sell a car. - Yeah, I know. Hi there, Jimmy. So how are things generally? Good? Yeah, it's good. I wanted to do this quickly, because I have to go. You have to go? But we're about to do business. - That's now how I meant it. I was… - What the hell, Jimmy? We both know what awaits you. What the hell are you talking about? - Why are you hushing me? - Listen up. It's for your own good. The cops could be here at any moment. Right? - Don't you worry about my concerns. - No, hey. If I'm Mother Theresa and do good for you. What fucking…? If I'm Mother Theresa, you can be nice too. Will you be able to spend this money? - -What do you know about me and money? - Do you deserve it? Shouldn't I hold it until the cops get you? You'll be in jail. We both know what you did. That old lady in the parking lot. Don't cry on my fancy couches. That upholstery is special. Hey, come on! Say something, damn it! Don't walk in here and act all tough. - Don't knock on my door twice. - What did I say? You don't know who the fuck I am! I don't want to come to your ugly garage! I don't want to be here! I never in my life wanted to come here! Not your fucking garage! I want to sell that damn car and nothing else! If you don't take the key from me, I will strangle you right now. Got it?

Start, you fucker! Start! What the fuck have you done to it? Start the car! Start the car! Start the car, I said! Start the car! What the hell are you doing? Come on! Ow, damn it! Josephine, let me explain. I never meant to hurt you, make you sad, or to lie. I just got myself into a very difficult situation that I couldn't get out of. I have never in my life meant to hurt anyone. I am a nice guy, I promise. Let me explain. Please call me. Damn, Leo, I'm sorry. The reason I didn't tell you about the accident was because I didn't want to drag you into it. But you did manage to do that, didn't you? She just jumped out in front of the car, and I couldn't… I couldn't do anything, My bag was full of drugs, and the cops were coming. The cops even went to Josephine's job, and found her too. How do they do that? And on top of that, Jochum keeps calling from Holland. "Where's my money?" Just take it easy, damn it. Take it easy. Go to a coffee shop and…fuck off! It just annoys me. What's going on with your new friend Dragan? He sent me to some garage yesterday where four guys beat me up. - Beat you up? - I was selling a car, and they stole it. - I find that kind of funny. - What's so funny about it? That they stole a car from a car thief. - I find that funny. - Never mind. That wasn't why I called you. Now I really need your help. That didn't sound very funny. That Dragan… I'm not letting that cunt screw me over. Yeah, no… - I'll pass on that. Seriously. - What do you mean, pass? Don't give me that bullshit. I did two years for you and Kricke. I didn't say a single word. Not even once. So now it's your fucking turn to be of service. I was at a funeral. Kricke's mom came up to me. And she gave me this. I don't want it. You take it. Kricke was all image. Image and movie quotes. "I'll make him an offer he can't refuse." He was just all wrong… But he was good. HEY. WE NEED TO TALK. CALL ME. HUGS, JOSIE Yeah. - Want a ride into town? - Was that the girl? - Yeah. - "Yeah". So you're back together? We'll see. She jumped out right in front of the car. I couldn't stay, since… Well… The car was full of stuff. I would have ended up doing several years' hard time. - What kind of stuff? - A bag full of ecstasy from Holland. It was going to be just this once. A chance to make enough money to start over. To not have to live like some fucking loser. The thought that…I can't be with you is crushing. You're the best thing that's happened to me. Come with me. Let's get away from all this. We can do it. It's an opportunity. - And no more secrets? - No more secrets. - Do you promise? - I do. This is going to be so great. Mexico, can you imagine? It's like a dream, you know. I've seen Mexico in all these movies. Now I'm going there with you. It'll be the best thing I have ever done. What did you say? Jimmy? Come with me. Close the door. - Yes. - Hello, hi. It's me. Boss. Boss. Hello. Just so you know, your errand boy was here. I don't know if he's really my errand boy, but go ahead. He ran away fast, tail tucked between his legs. I didn't give him a penny. - So now you know the status. - Take care. Bye. I don't know what the car dealer is on about, but we have the Scanian where we want him. - Nice. Who did it belong to? - My cousin. Awesome. - Hi there! - Hello. I feel like I'm on top of it. This guy in Malmö is getting us the passports. Okay. So we drive down to Malmö, pick them up, and then go to Denmark. I don't know for how long, but then… Damn it, come back. I'll be right back. Now the horseshoe ring is on, with diamonds and bling. Here we go. Does it make you fly, or anything? Any super power at all? I mean, we'll need it. You know what you're doing, right? Right? You bet your ass I do. - Hi, welcome. - Thanks. How are things? Good. Do you want to play? There's an open slot. - Thanks. - Boys, one more player! - Are you playing? - I'll be right there. Dragan! Jimmy, Jimmy. Back up a bit, Peppe. - You should leash your puppy. - He's calm as long as I am. How are you doing? I'm fine. I figured we should talk for a bit. I get it. Let's go to the office. Are you on your way somewhere? - Well? - No, I mean… Damn it! - Is your body guard a mute? - Never mind him. - How are you, Jimmy? - I'm doing good. You seem a bit tense. - No, I'm just… It's fine. - Good. I came here because I think I need to get an answer. About the money? I get it. I'm sorry to have to say it again, but… You have to give me a few more days. I had to send it up north. No one in Stockholm wanted it. - I've done my best, Jimmy. - Where I'm from, our word is bond. You told me you stood by your word. I do, it's not to the point where you're not getting your money. I've just bought some time. That's all I need. - Bought time? - Exactly. So, relax. Come in and play for a bit. - I can put a bit down for you. - I'll have some water. - Get you some. - Yeah. - Misdeal. - What do you mean? What the hell is this? That's the second "misdeal." What do you want? - Calm down. - Let go of me, damn it. Call me in three days, if you haven't heard from me. Don't put your paws on me. Get the boss in here. - Three days? - Let me check out what's going on. Hold on. Isn't three days a little…? Relax, Jimmy. We'll deal with it when I get back. Sit down. - I said "sit down." - All right. You're the boss? Your mom is the boss of the toilets in here. What's the issue, boys? - What's the commotion? - A tough guy. Money, money. Yes! "Everyone makes mistakes"? He's looking at my cards. If you want a new dealer, just say so. Dealer, finish this round, and then switch. Let go! Back off, damn it! You come with me! I said "sit down"! Stay there! - What are you up to, Jimmy? - Stop! You moron. You think I didn't know you were crossing me? - It's my money. - Open the door! - Open the door! - Did you really come here to rob me? - Don't open it! - I told you to let us out! - Really? Let you go? - I'm sick of hearing your bullshit!! Open up, Bullen. Open up! - Where will you go? - Think this will stop you? Answer me! - Open the door! - I've opened it! - Jimmy, look at me. I'm coming for you! - Go fuck yourself! What are you guys all doing? What are you doing? He's taken the key. My money! In my house! What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck? - Take it easy. - I can't! Do you want them to come after us? - Left or right? - Right! Watch out for the ladies, damn it! What did you say? We're lucky that I brought it. - We are so awesome! - Speak for yourself. - Speak for yourself. - Speak for yourself. - Hey… do you want to split the money now? - Jimmy, it's fine. Never mind.. - Are you sure? - If anyone needs that money, it's you. But promise me one thing: go to Mexico and take this girl with you. Start over, and do things right. When you land in Tijuana, call a barber, cut your hair, and then you can start over. And here's an idea: try actually buying a car for once. Have you ever done that? No, you haven't. Josie, Josie, where are you? I pulled it off! It feels so good! We made it. Mexico, I'll fix it. Imagine that, Leo gave us his entire share. He's such a good guy. Do we have everything? Did I forget anything? Bag! Damn… Come on, Josie. We've got it. Damn. Kricke. The fucking ring. - But… - I left it in the bathroom. Forget about it. Forget… IN MEMORY OF SCOT OVERTON 1947-2016 Subtitle translation by: D. Thelin
