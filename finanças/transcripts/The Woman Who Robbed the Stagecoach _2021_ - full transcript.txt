Tilt a little more. There we go. Yeah, we want that attitude. Okay, put your, why don't you put your foot up on that bench there. Very good. Put your knee across that's right. Now this one is for posterity. This one is going to go down through time, okay. So right down to the barrel of that lens, I wanted to want you to look right through the years. Okay.

Yes, you are. My family name is... How do you like the sound of Pearl Hart? I must attend the lecture soon. Have you ever been to Chicago? Fred. I'm ready. Where's the rope? Forgot to bring one? Just jump. Jump? Yeah, what's wrong? Don't be afraid. Come one, come all, see the world famous Buffalo Bill. Straight from the wild west. Savage Indians of the Plains. Cowboys from the Rocky mountains. Fred. Fred. I saw her. Who? I saw Annie Oakley. Did you make anything? No. I feed you. I put clothes on your back. And you don't even lend me a helping hand. Fred, there's a constable right there. Oh, no, no. He's coming, let's go. Hey. Fred. Huh? What if we went out west? We could live life like Bill and Annie Oakley. Find ourselves a cabin in the Rockies. Raise horses and chickens. You sure would like that, wouldn't you? Get me scalped by some red man, or worse. Hey, but you might fit in there anyhow. Be some ingin's wife. What do they call them? I ain't tired yet. I won't be gone but a little while. Squaw. That's it. Virgil told about the good housewife. She rose early in the morning in order to delegate the jobs of the household, and even king Solomon in the Bible could see the benefit and value of women. He saw their feminine industry and their feminine economy, even though those days were long before right now. So what I will share to both men and women, many of you will not want to hear.

I was not of my right mind, Pearl. You know that that intolerable drunk in Chicago is not truly the man you married. And where did he come from? I must confess. I do know, but I can assure you he has left, never to be seen again. Well, if you want me, take me to Arizona. You do want a Western life, don't ya? I'd like to provide it for you, Pearl. And the child? Will he come with us? I think at best we established ourselves first and then send for him. Your mother may watch him in the meantime. And wouldn't it be nice to have some time to ourselves without a care in the world? We've never really had that, have we? No we haven't. I can be your Buffalo Bill and you can be my Annie Oakley. Fight for your country gentlemen. Fight the Spanish. You look like an able-bodied man. The army needs you, sir. Join up today. Good pay and good rations. Fight for your country. War with Cuba. War with Spain. We must beat them before they beat us. Remember the main, the hell with Spain. I told you, no come here again. Is my wife around? Take her home. You got it, lady. Pearl. Pearl.

Cuba to fight for our country. I may never see you again. There's the possibility I may never return. You can't just leave. I can do anything I damn well please. Frederick Hart, I hope you die out there. Fred, I didn't mean it. Good morning, miss. I've got two more loads after this one. Might get to it then. It's ain't no that. I come ask you something. Please forgive way I speak. I not born America. Miss? Can't you see here I got work to do? I hear some say you take men at night. Who said that? I no remember. Where'd you hear something like that, huh? Maybe it's come from dream. What's your name? Joe. Joe Boot. Sounds American to me. It do? Well, what you heard was, was a goddamn lie if there ever was one. Yes, miss. Don't be calling me that. I ain't no madam, or missus, or Mademoiselle. The name's Pearl, if you've got to use it. - Pearl. - Mail delivery. Listen up. - Mumford. - Pearl. Roe. Whitlock. McCallister. Anything for Hart? Let me look. For you, ma'am. Jefferson. Smith. Have you heard? Yes. Well, what are we going to do? I don't know. You really think they'll close it? There won't be no men round here. We won't make nothing no more. What's your meaning? They're shutting up the mine. Ain't you heard a word I said about it? Mary Ellen, I think it's best we find our way home. If I had one, I'd already be there. Anyhow, we better make what we can while there's still someone around here to make it from. Ms. Pearl? Ms. Pearl? It's Joe. That'll be $2. I happy I find you. Pays up front. No, no. Ms. Pearl, I come tell you. All go tomorrow. Tell me something I don't know. I stay. Okay. The mine, not this mine, another mine, my mine. Two miles. Where'd you get this? I purchase. My mine. What do you know about mining? Me learn. You're a goddamn fool. I reckon you got this from another one of your dreams. Ms. Pearl. It's just Pearl. I ask you make this business venture with me. Why me? I see you work. Hard. Strong. I say to myself, Joe, this is the woman you want. Yeah, a woman. I suppose you don't have anything else in that mind of yours about this woman. Miss Pearl. I am man of word. I met plenty of men, just like you. And there word doesn't mean nothing to me. What you yanks say? Spit and shake. We partners now, Pearl. I see you one morning. Joe. Good night. My mine. You see? I see. I suppose you got the equipment we need stashed away somewhere. Me find that. Just what I figured. I don't know about where you come from, but around here, these things cost money. Yes, Pearl. I have idea about this too. You sure this is going to work? I tell him Pearl wait. What if he doesn't fall for it? He have many risks. - Joe. - What? So he just walks in here and... Shh. He come. That boy weren't lying. Come on in. Why don't you tell me what he told you? He told me if I gave him a good deal on a frying pan, he'd let me lay with a woman who was as purdy as the sea and that boy weren't lying. You fool. They're gonna come after us. Come on. How much did we get? Hello Jesus. Coast is clear. Coast? This come to good use. You said you were just going to take his money once his trousers came off. You didn't say nothing about near knocking his brains out. I not want him lay with Pearl. Well, next time you ought to just pull a six shooter on him. Six shoot? A gun. I no have. This ain't the kind of country you want to be in without one. Yes. You eat? Thank you. In morning, I go to town, get tools for mine. Not that town. They'll string you up. String? I go next town. Close. Yeah. Might just dig yourself right back to where you came from. Close, Pearl. I tell you. You've been telling me a lot of things ever since I met your sorry ass. Now we're in here, you might just get us killed. I can't make up my mind if that'd be such a bad thing after all. You're right. Joe know nothing. Maybe you go back. It's not you. My mother's dying. I heard from her around the time the mine shut down. She needs money for the doctors. She has my child. I ain't seen him in a couple of weeks since, I never thought my life would turn out this way. Pearl, Joe have one more idea. For this, we need six shoot. What type of gun is your husband in the market for, ma'am? Nothing too cumbersome. I see. We have this 58 Remington conversion that he might like, just came in from back east. Pardon me, mister, I think that's a little large. Just what sort of task is this gentleman hoping to achieve? Say again? Is he going to shoot rabbits or rob a bank? Does he intend to use this instrument or just hang it on the mantle piece? I expect he intends to use it. Colt 45 caliber revolver, reliable, and certainly within your price range. That'll do. And I'd like something, minus a pound or two, in case he decides to travel light, and a box of bullets for each. ♪ It's as old ♪ ♪ As eye of the weary ♪ ♪ Hard times, hard times ♪ ♪ Come again no more ♪ ♪ Many days you have lingered ♪ ♪ Around my cabin door ♪ ♪ Oh hard times ♪ ♪ Come again no more ♪ ♪ Oh, hard times ♪ ♪ Come again no more ♪ It start globe, come down, Florence.

Have you ever been to Chicago? I can be your Buffalo Bill. You can be my Annie Oakley. I play the keys. But I can assure you, he has left. Never to be seen again.

I'm a reporter. Don't get no ideas about leaving. Sheriff, this must be her. Her who? The woman who robbed the stage coach. The bandit queen. Queen? Well, that's the moniker of the Daily Star gave you. I have to say it's a mighty good one. The Tucson paper? Matter of fact, kind of wish I'd come up with that one myself. Well, that's where we're taking her. We got no facility suitable for her kind. But you can't take her, by golly. I just rode all the way here from Benson as soon as I heard about the arrest. Let me sit down and have a cup of coffee with my subject and conduct a proper interview here. I don't know or care about no subject. I could care less back to your damn interview. What about Joe? Couple of love birds, ain't you? I'd like to have a minute with him, if you'd allow it. Sheriff? Down there. You tell men stage coach are my think. All Joe, no Pearl. No. Joe. There's a good chance we ain't ever gonna see each other again. I suppose you might see each other at the trial. But there's a good chance this is goodbye. Trial? Yes. Pearl, I so sorry. I never find money for mine. You never did pull the wool over my eyes. That's more than any other man could say. Now you listen, you listen what Joe say. You start loud. You call Joe a son of a, you know. Maybe they think we no partners. Maybe they think you no want to rob stage. Joe make you do. Pearl, you listen what Joe say. I love you, Pearl. You god damn dirty bastard. I never would've gotten to this mess if it wasn't for you. Pearl. All right, come on, let's go. - You no good dirty bastard. - Pearl? I hope you rot in hell. Pearl! I say to myself, Joe, this is the woman you want. Hey, are you that girl they been talking about? Doc, I swear, I don't know how she snuck it in. Doesn't really matter now, the damage is already done. And it don't look like it was the first time that she's done such a thing. You think she'll try it again? Well, if she has the opportunity, I'm sure the next time she'll do an even finer job. Yeah, Doc. Hey, over there. Your name's Pearl, right? Shut it. Quiet or they'll hear us. They'll hear you. I ain't got nothing to say. Well then at least listen to me. Before you came along, I was in there. That's my cell, the one you're in. What I'm getting at is see, I've been here a mighty long while, eight or nine months now. I lost count. If you look at the wall, not the one underneath the window, the one across from the one tween you and me. I was digging a hole. There ain't no hole. Well, not yet there ain't on account of the fact that they took my cell and gave it to you. Feel it. It's soft right in the middle, like butter. If you can finish the job that I started, maybe we both can get ourselves out of here. Well, you ain't said no yet. So when you finish with that there hole, come around the front, sneak through while Billy's having one of his sweet dreams and come let me out of here. Hey, where are you going? What do you want from me? Well, seeing as how we just made a jailbreak together, I was thinking that maybe... Look, I didn't ask for no partner, and I don't want no partner. Miss, I think that's mighty ungrateful, especially considering how you'd still... What'd I tell ya? Now go your own way. Go on. Shit. Ms. Hart, would you tell the court why is it that you and the man name Joe Boot decided to rob the stage coach. Answer the question, Mrs. Hart. What can I say? It was between the devil and the deep blue sea. I'm just glad no one got hurt. We didn't know if we got $40 or $400. We just wanted to get the hell out of there. But I gave them each a dollar. Didn't want them to go hungry. Joe begged me to blame him for what we'd done, but he was my partner. He was just trying to help me get home to my mother. I know it's public knowledge that I took attempts at my own life. But the only person I ever tried to kill was myself. The irony of freedom is for me that it took risking everything I ever had until I had nothing left to lose. Wasn't until then the whole world made me their bandit queen. What a dream. I take it that's the end of your story. Yes, your honor. Yes it is. Ladies and gentlemen. I'm sure we've heard all we need to hear from these two prisoners. Gentlemen of the jury, you will now retire to begin your deliberations. I just hope you'll allow me to finish my lunch before rendering your verdict. Court is in recess. Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have your honor. Will the jury foreman please rise and read the verdict. On the charge of armed robbery, the jury finds both defendants not guilty. Order. Counsel, get your asses up here. This is unacceptable. She won fair and square, your honor. She manipulated them. We could have her arrested on another charge. Yes, but what? Tampering with the US mail. The mail was on the coach. Yes. But it's kinda weak. She had a gun. She shouldn't have been carrying a gun. Isn't she your client? Two charges are better than one. Bailiff, arrest the woman Pearl Hart and Joe Boot. No. We've been acquitted. I shall not be tried by a law that our sex had no voice in making. No. Yes? It's about the woman, sir. Come in. There's one of them reporters here requesting an interview. Another? This one come in all the way from New York. Hell, I got letters from three others here. It might not be such a bad idea for the prison's reputation, and yours too, sir, if you don't mind me saying. Hmm. With all that exposure, huh. We could improve her accommodations. Put her in the larger cell up by the mountain. I see to it right away, sir. And get her a brand new bed, for god's sakes, and fresh linens. Can't have this place looking like a prison, can we? Ms. Hart. Newspaperman here to see you all the way from New York. Manhattan, to be exact. And I would prefer journalist. Just getting settled in? I guess. Might not be a bad idea to get comfortable with such a long stay. I meant no offense. If you don't mind the direct question, Ms. Hart, how do you plan to spend the next five years? As quickly as possible. I think we will be sitting for this interview, but first we must take your portrait. Guard, is there anything else she can wear? Perhaps what she was arrested in? I'll ask to the warden, and I prefer officer. Huh. Well, officer, a gun for her to hold, unloaded of course.
