Trigger Truth! Ultraman Trigger's fight with the clan of Darkness. It was an epic battle that involved all of humanity. Ultraman, you can do it! -You can do it, Trigger! -You can do it! Ultraman, you can do it! Everyone's smiles... are giving me strength! Okay! Do it, Yuna! The power of the Eternity Core... into the Nursedessei! Nurse Cannon, fire! Fire! The battle over the Eternity Core, a supreme energy that sleeps within the Earth, ended in victory when Trigger turned the light of people into power. Kengo Manaka! It's your fault! If it wasn't for you...! That's right. Thanks to Ultraman, world peace was preserved. Nine years later. The story is passed on to a new light. ULTRAMAN DECKER PREVIEW SPECIAL SHINE BRIGHT! BURST FORTH! LEAP OUT! DECKER! LET'S LOOK AT THE SUPER POWERS OF THE NEW ULTRAMAN! Oof. Grampa, behind you! Watch out! May I ask your name? His name is Kanata Asumi. Kanata Asumi! I look towards tomorrow! Into the beyond! He's a kind young man who works at his family's rice cracker store. He's cheerful, and sometimes gets carried away... but he goes on to join the defense team, GUTS-Select... Go! ...and is forced to face numerous difficulties. Okay! One more! He hides a great secret. Don't underestimate Earthlings! That is... by inserting an Ultra Dimension Card into the Ultra D Flasher... Shine Bright! Flash! Decker! ...Kanata Asumi transforms into Ultraman Decker. Decker changes forms to adapt to various situations. His first form is his well-balanced basic form... Ultraman Decker Flash Type. ULTRAMAN DECKER FLASH TYPE The shining light that appeared on Earth, Ultraman Decker. The basic form of Flash Type reflects Kanata's straight-forward personality. It faces enemies with an aggressive fighting style. Its special attack is the Selgend Beam fired from its crossed arms. The next form is... Decker's power-focused form... Ultraman Decker Strong Type. ULTRAMAN DECKER STRONG TYPE The strength in its mighty arms can match that of even the strongest monster. Powerful physical combat is Strong Type's specialty. ULTRA DIMENSION CARD ULTRAMAN DECKER MIRACLE TYPE The last form we'll introduce is... the psychic power-wielding Ultraman Decker Miracle Type. Miracle Type is all about miraculous, phantasmagoric psychic abilities. Expect Decker to face his enemies using various abilities. Nine years before Decker appeared... Ultraman Trigger, who protected Earth at the time, also changed forms to fight. Let's look at his battle alongside Tiga, who also excels at Type Changing. Ultraman Trigger Power Type! First is his strength form, Power Type. Like Decker's Strong Type, it's a form that excels at physical combat. Its special attack is Deracium Beam Torrent. Ultraman Trigger Sky Type! Next is the agile Sky Type form. It's a form adept at aerial combat and using speed to fight. It can fly every which way at unbelievable speed. Its special attack, Rundbolt Beam Shell, never misses a target. And his basic form, Multi Type. Well-balanced in power and speed, as the name implies, it is a variable form, that boasts numerous combat abilities. With Tiga and Trigger's double Zeperion Beam, victory is assured. Let's turn our attention to a different dimension. There is an Ultra Hero very similar to Decker. Let's do it! His name is Dyna. ULTRAMAN DYNA He's a hot-blooded hero who fights with fiery passion. A hero who has traversed other universes and won numerous battles to restore peace. Let's go! All set? He, too, changes forms to fight according to the situation. His basic balanced form, like Decker's, is called Flash Type. It fights in a dynamic style. When he needs to use enhanced strength he changes into Strong Type. Dyna has overpowered countless monsters with his great might. Like Decker, Dyna has a Miracle Type that specializes in psychic abilities. He still retains his dynamic fighting style in this form. With its Ultra Barrier, it can perform tricky maneuvers like reflecting attacks. Its special attack, Revolium Wave Attack Version, is also quite powerful. And now Decker must protect the peace his predecessors have built. SPHERE What is that thing?! Mysterious beings from space, the Sphere, target Earth and attack. -Fire! -Roger! They are an enemy of all humanity that will threaten Kanata and his friends. The Sphere use small clusters of Sphere Soldiers... and monsters like the unrivaled Spheresaurus, among various other threats. And that's not all. The Sphere can absorb other monsters, turning them into violent Sphere Synthetic Monsters. SPHERE-GOMORA, THE ANCIENT SYNTHETIC MONSTER Why are the Sphere invading Earth? The mystery only deepens. Decker must fight more than just the Sphere. DEATHDRAGO, THE DESTRUCTIVE RAMPAGE DRAGON Humanity is also threatened by monsters that have awakened after years of slumber. There is a defense team that faces such threats. This will be your first mission. GUTS-Select, move out! Roger! The new GUTS-Select. Security HQ, come in! An exceptional member with a professional attitude and abilities to match... Soma Ryumon possesses keen senses and a burning heart within. You're slower than usual. I swear... A female member who dreamed of working in space development... Ichika Kirino always looks forward with drive and intent. If only we could talk like this. Do you really think they'll come again? The sub-leader with extensive knowledge of monsters... Vice captain Sawa Kaizaki also pilots the Nursedessei. ...it should lose the will to fight. Move to emergency alert Code 4. The former TPU training school principal... Captain Taiji Murahoshi always leads his forces with composure. But I know there must be hope. That's me. The artificial intelligence that controls fighter jets... The cybernetic companion, H.A.N.E.2. HANE2, THE CYBERNETIC COMPANION These unique members join together to make up the team. Let's all work together... to protect... what's important. Roger! Kengo! There were elites who fought together with Trigger nine years ago. Temporary repairs are complete! The previous GUTS-Select team. Protect Shizuma at all costs! Roger! They faced a darkness of far greater strength than themselves... and fought bravely to the end to protect peace on Earth. Shizuma, you're a member of GUTS-Select! Trust your friends and complete your mission! Nanase, is the GUTS Falcon good to go?! Of course. GUTS-Select faced threats using a varied arsenal. Let's make this spectacular! The remote-controlled flying convertible Droader, the GUTS Falcon. GUTS FALCON The anti-monster battleship that serves as a command base, the Nursedessei. They used these and other powerful equipment in battle. This arsenal continues to fight to protect the Earth. The GUTS Falcon and Nursedessei are still in active service. The new GUTS-Select team is connected to its predecessors not only by the equipment they use, but also the will they carry on. Back then, there was a group that supported GUTS-Select from the shadows. The TPU Technology Division's Special Section 3. Also... The chief, Masamichi Hotta... Maybe use the magnetic repulsion? ...and the Alien Metron, Marluru, who became a GUTS-Select member. This is getting fun! This complex... He developed and did maintenance on the GUTS Falcon and Nursedessei. They worked tirelessly for peace. It's equipped with the Nurse Cannon. Oh, this. That does seem quite impressive. Moving along... Hey! Kengo Manaka, the incarnation of light, used items to become Ultraman Trigger, like the GUTS Sparklence and GUTS Hyper Keys. These were developed by Hijiri Akito, a high schooler at the time. Here are the simulation results. The new GUTS-Select has its own reliable brain. His name is Professor Yuichiro Asakage. Greetings. I'm Ichiro Asakage. I'm counting on you. The new weapon that Professor Asakage developed... Ready to launch. ...is a new fighter jet piloted by HANE2. The GUTS Hawk. GUTS HAWK It flies the skies with the GUTS Falcon, which has been modified for manned control. Windom, Agira, Miclas! Go! Did you know there are monsters that fight alongside the Ultra Heroes? The Capsule Monsters Miclas... MICLAS, THE CAPSULE MONSTER Agira... AGIRA, THE CAPSULE MONSTER and Windom are just a few. WINDOM, THE CAPSULE MONSTER They are reliable allies who have helped the Ultra Heroes in numerous situations. Miclas, Windom, Agira! Return! Miclas! They will come to help Decker, too. MICLAS, THE DIMENSION CARD MONSTER Hopefully, you'll see them in action for yourselves. Believe in our power. The power of GUTS-Select. Together... we'll protect the future of smiles! Okay! Nine years ago... Ultraman Trigger... and GUTS-Select fought desperately to protect peace. Battle Mode! Fire all weapons! They did so because they believed a bright future lay beyond their battles. -Carmeara! -Kengo Manaka! And that future... has been passed on to a new generation. What is the secret between Kanata and Decker? Just what do the enigmatic Sphere want? Open fire! Roger! The new GUTS-Select team will face numerous challenges. Fire! Go forth, Kanata!
