Treat 'em right and trade with them, might show you where some gold is. Hey, that red scalp's worth $25 up there in Sedora. His ma was worth 75. [music playing] MAN [VOICEOVER]: Pitcalin, we gonna find any water out there? PITCALIN [VOICEOVER]: Maybe. Maybe not. MAN [VOICEOVER]: Ask her where them gold nuggets came from, Pitcalin. And if she don't tell us, we gonna skin her over that fire. MAN [VOICEOVER]: Hey Pitcalin, if I happen across their carcasses, I'll toss a cactus flower on them. MAN [VOICEOVER]: Aim for the knee, and you get 'em in the guts every time. [laughter] [shouting] [cheering] [laughter] Come on. Come on, little lady, just give me a kiss. [whimpering] MAN: Yee ha.

You keep what you find, and I'll keep what I find, and that's-- [grunts] Hold it. You no-good skunk, I'm going to kill you. I ought to shoot him, Ben. Shouldn't ought to plug folk, Billy. It's a damn sin, it is. [chuckling] Give me. [click] [laughter] Stupid muck. [gasps] [whimpering] You reckon we can get some out of her after last night's little romp? She won't tell you nothing. MAN: We'll see about that. [click] Billy? [whimpering] Lord, upon this rock I'm gonna build your church. And the forces of hell shall not prevail against it. [grunting] [whimpering] MAN: Billy! No sense your friend having all the fun. [chuckling] All right, I'm gonna be nice to you. I want you to me where you got them gold nuggets. Come on, now. If you get ornery, I'm going to have to get mean. All right, just settle down, or I'm going to cut this girl's throat. Billy? Y'all come here. I think we get some corn squeezins' down this gal, she might tell us something. [laughter] MAN: All bruised, the little lady. Maybe she'd like some of this rot gut. Don't waste it on that day.

All who share in His will will be saved. Now, you wanna be saved, don't you? MAN: Enough of the saved talk, she tells us now. MAN: Let's play with her Ben, a dead squaw's no fun. [whimpering] [panting] I'm tired of messing with you, I'm gonna cut your throat. [non-english speech] What'd she say, Pitcalin? She said she'd show you the gold. You coming with us? Thought maybe so. She tried to club me with a stick, Ben. Put that one on the pack horse. Ben? She's cashed out. [dramatic music] That's just to dang bad, ain't it. Ain't no use laying around here. Pack up and get out. Here's your horse, Deacon. Thank you. Y'all go on, I got a funeral to perform. BEN: Well, don't go getting long winded, Deacon. We got gold to find. At it again. [chuckling] DEACON: It ain't my thought, it's my calling. Brethren, my heart's desire, my prayer to God that they might be saved. For they was ignorant of God's righteousness and they never submitted themselves to that righteousness. But I believe the promise of the Lord will abide, and them Indians will be saved. That ought to pay for the services, don't you think, sir? Good night, my child. God is with you. [music playing] [flies buzzing] [shouting in non-english speech] [music playing] DEACON: [SINGING] Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves, here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves. Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves. [vultures squawking] [screaming] Get out of that grub, Billy. I'm hungry, Ben. We got about two hours of daylight left. You want to get some more moving time in or stay here? We keep going. All right, suits me. Hey Ben, I'm getting sick. You remember what mama said about my getting sick if I don't eat. Help you down? What are you waiting for? I thought you were starving? Get that grub on. Mama's boy, I bet you. [chuckling] [scraping] Ah, that was a pretty good meal, Billy. Ah, I think I'll bed down. DEACON: [READING] -- brother, the gentiles had also received the Word of God. Now, when Peter was come up to Jerusalem-- [coyote howling] [WHISPERING] Don't do anything [non-english]. I'm your friend. Tu amigo. I'm friendly. DEACON: [READING]: And expanded by order unto them. I was in a city-- What's the high pair for opening? Any old thing you want. I'll take the limit. [chuckling] Now that ain't a nice thing to do in a gentleman's game, Deacon. [laughter] BEN: Deacon, you take the midnight watch, and Pitcalin will take it to wake up. [laughter] Billy, tie her up. All right, squaw, let's go. [music playing] [coyote howling] -[WHISPERING] Billy? -What? What? What's a matter? Shh! Keep quiet. BILLY: Damn near scared me to death. Well, what'd you do that for? Shh. [WHISPERING] It's all right, brother Billy. I got something to show you. Come on. Well? You coming? Well come on, jughead. Wait. [chuckling] BILLY: Look at that. DEACON: Don't let her see you. Look at that, boy, I like that. [chuckling] MAN: [whispering] I remove my eyes from her wickedness. She's the Devil's widow. [chuckling] Why, it's sure nice. Look at that. [chuckling] Look at that. Ooh. Oh, man. BILLY: Sure beats gold digging, don't it? DEACON: It sure do. [laughter] DEACON: That sure is pretty, boy. Look at it. [laughter] Look at it, look at that. [gasping] Pitcalin? Deacon, you've been a bad boy. Uh [shouting] no! [laughter] You devil! [laughter] [grunting] [gunshot] [grunting] [panting] All right, Pitcalin, I'm going to kick your guts in. [grunting] MAN: Hello, little squaw woman. [laughter] [grunting] [laughter] BEN: Get him, Billy. MAN: Get him, Billy. Hit him, Billy. Go to the eye. Hit him in the eye. Get him in the eye. His eyes, stupid-- go for his eyes, stupid. I baptize you by the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost. [laughter] Where are you? I'm gonna kick your guts in. [roars] [gasping] Get her out of here. Brother of yours-- hopeless. Hopeless. Fights dirty, Ben. [thunder] [thunder] [music playing] [non-english speech] [non-english speech] BEN: Well, what'd she say? She says we're headed for the desert country. [laughter] Better hang onto those muddy sticks, Two Card. They ain't none where we;re headed. We going to find any water out there? Maybe. Maybe not. We'll stop soon, water the horses, fill up the canteens. Water your horses here, fill your canteens upstream. [gasping] [chuckling] [clearing throat] I'll say-- [clears throat] I'll say one thing for you, brother Billy. You got a lot of spunk, getting down into a strain game with old Pitcalin here. [laughter] Ben, I still got the corn squeezings jug. You want me to fill it up with water? Yeah, if you think you got the strength. Got the strength. [derisive laughter] [music playing] Pitcalin, let's move out. [braying] Come on, you. Come on, you. Get up, get up. Get up there, you. Brother Pitcalin, got something I wanna talk over with you. Being a servant of the Lord, I can fix you and that Injun up, Pitcalin. Being that we're friends-- sort of partners, you might say. Uh-huh, what's on your mind? DEACON: I'd make it right betweenst you, the Lord, and that Injun. That's what I do, Pitcalin. Uh-huh. Well, I'll put the gold band of righteousness on you two for, um, 15% of what you're finding. A small way with that Injun. Seems fair, don't you think? Remember, Pitcalin, blessed are those who share. [snorts] Insult me, will you? I'll see your guts rot in hell. Heeyah. Then we will need partner, won't we, Deacon? Looks like the Deacon's got one of his sermons coming on. [music playing] What's the matter, old mule? Your leg hurting? Much further, Pitcalin? Hey, Pitcalin, when do we get to this Oro de Dios, or whatever she called the water hole? When do we get to it, and the gold? Huh? Manana. [non-english speech] I don't have all month. Manana. Tomorrow. We'll be at water and nuggets. Well, blessed are those who congregate, brothers. I'm camping. Two Card, you and Pitcalin take care of the horses. Billy, break out the grub while I make the fire. [music playing] [crickets chirping] [grunting] Billy! Wake up, Billy. What's the matter, Benji? BEN: Pitcalin's gone. BILLY: Ben, our canteens is done empty. That skunk poured out our water. [gasping] [wind blowing] [grunting] [shouting] No. [gasping] Simmer down. Simmer down. I'm not gonna hurt you. Please. [grunting] [non-english speech] [shouting] [non-english speech] I know. [non-english speech]. [whimpering] [non-english speech] [non-english speech] No. No. No. [SCREAMING] No. No. No, no. [shouting] [weeping] TWO CARD: Give me a card. DEACON: Brother Two Card, I told you, if you keep playing the devil's game, it's gonna get you. TWO CARD: Come on, Deacon, let me play cards. Deal. Hit it. DEACON: Gambling's evil. That's good, it's evil, Billy. Shh. Let me alone, Deacon. DEACON: Two Card's leading you astray, Billy. We going to wait around here all day? Play your cards. DEACON: He's back, he's back. The Lord's blessed this house. [laughter] Did she tell you about the gold, Brother Pitcalin? Well? I brought her back, Mr. Dawson. She brought us out here so we'd die. There ain't no damn gold, anyway. PITCALIN: That's where you're wrong, Two Card Charlie. What? Gold's near water, about a day's ride from here. Well, let's go get it. Hold it. Why share? Why not keep it all for yourself, Pitcalin? Same reason we're one big happy family. We need each other. And besides, I left my gear here. You best get some rest if you're digging tomorrow. [laughter] Let's get some rest. [laughter] [dramatic music] [coyote howling] [whinnying] No. Get up. The horses are gone. Will you get? BILLY: Gone where, Ben? Let's get after them. I gotta get them horses. My mule's out there. BEN: Them horses were cut loose. Let's have a little talk with that Indian lover. BILLY: Ben? Ben? [panting] I can't see a damn thing out there, Ben. Why? You getting too greedy, Pitcalin? TWO CARD: He wants it for himself, that's why. I should have killed you. Let's get him, Ben. [shouting] [screaming] BEN: All right, where's our horses, Pitcalin? That's whe're I go. You been lying to us, woman. I'm gonna cut you where you'll b-- [screaming] Benji? Help me, Benji. Benji? [sobbing] Benji? Benji? No. Watch the rear. Watch it. Just one out there, I reckon. All for Billy, huh? If it going to hurt? Benji? Benji? I think I'm dead, Ben. I can't move my legs, my feet, or nothing. Yes you can. You can. I can't, Ben. I can't. I can't. Make a litter. Best to stay here in comfort, Billy. We got to be going now, Billy. You understand? [music playing] [click] You no good, backstabbing-- [grunting] [gasping] [music playing] Two Card, did you hear a shot awhile back? Pitcalin? Did you hear a pistol shot awhile back? Billy ought to have a family burial. Shouldn't dry up like that-- filthy old hide. Or have a plot or a stone of some kind. He ought to see mama again. She'd have liked the parson to say some words over him. My blessings on you all, brothers. I'm coming, Billy. [wind blowing] I'm coming, Billy. The Deacon's coming, Billy. The Deacon's coming, Billy. I'm coming, Billy. Lord, Billy needs me and I'm tired of looking for him. Now, we made a bargain. I'm gonna build you a church and you're gonna lead me to some gold, remember? But Lord, you're not helping at all. Why won't you talk to me? Why won't you talk to me? You gotta help. Lord, why won't you talk to me? BEN: He's alive! It's Billy's. Look, it's still primed. See? It's still primed. He must have left it here. She knows about it, don't she? Hold it. Who's here, Mr. Dawson? The one that got Billy-- that Indian. TWO CARD: Hey, maybe she and that crazy Apache out there got something cooked up together. She's got her own reasons for not wanting him to catch up. All right. We're going back after Billy. You coming? You? Figure I'll meet the Apache sooner or later. Guess I'd rather it be later. Thanks. [wind blowing] Billy! Billy? Billy. Billy. [gasping] Come here, Billy. It's all right. You're going to be all right now. I came back. I can't reach the water. I'm tired. [crackle] [gunshot] [shouting] I'll seek you out, Lord. Never you mind. I'm gonna find you, and that's a plain fact. BEN: What are you-- what are you doing? No. No! No. Billy, help me. Billy? Billy? Please don't. You dirty pig. You red pig. You dirty pig. Help me. [gagging] Help! No. No. Billy? I came back for you, Billy, help me. Oh. [gasping] Help me, Billy. Billy? Billy? [whimpering] Help me. Billy, help me, Billy, help me, please. Help me. I came back-- Billy, Billy? No, don't go. Injun, come back here. Injun, help-- [gurgling] Where'd you go? Help me. Come back, Injun. Help me. [gasping] [coughing] Mama? Mama, help me, please, mama? Pitcalin! Mama, I'm sorry I brought Billy out [inaudible]. Mama, help me, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Give me another chance. [gurgling] [coughing] [gurgling] It's time to move out, Two Card. You staying? You're damn right. Lightning never strikes twice in the same spot. Hey Pitcalin, if I happen across your carcasses, I'll toss a cactus flower on them. [chuckling] For old time's sake, huh? Yeah, something like that. Where is that damned card? Gotta be here someplace. No, it's not here. [shouts] No, no, please, please. Please, don't. Oh, no. [grunting] I guess I'm going to jail, huh? I was leaving, honest. I don't have your damned gold. Pitcalin and his squaw have run off with it. Go after them. I don't have your damned gold. Hey. Hey, Indian? Hey, you gotta come back and untie me. Hey! Hey, Indian? Hey? [panting] God. [rattling] Where the hell have you been? What have you got there for me? Some food? Or maybe some water? I've got a fine Boston handgun. You can have it if you let me go. [panting] What's in that bag? Hey, don't. [rattling] [panting] I can't get out. [SCREAMING] I gotta get out. Help. Help. Help. Help me, I gotta get out of here. Help me. No, no. Help me. Oh, Lord, it hurts. It hurts! Oh, God, help me. Help me. Help. [screaming] Help me. Oh no, help me. [screaming] God! [gasping] Brother Two Card? Brother Two Card? What's the matter with you? It's a serpent. It's a serpent. I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you. Lord, God, I'm tired. Really. I'm tired. [sobbing] And you gotta quit teasing me 'cause I can't. I just can't keep looking for you unless-- unless you cooperate with me-- with your servant. Lord? [sobbing] [laughter] Oh, Lord. It's so good to see you again. So good. I knew you'd find me. I just knew it. I knew you'd find me. We're going home, my Lord. Going home. [SINGING] With my Jesus, now I'm going home. Going home, going home. With my Jesus, now I'm going home. [gunshot] [non-english speech] He's trying to kill us. [non-english speech] Your brother? Let's go.
