[MUSIC PLAYING] [BABY CRIES] [GRUNTING WITH EFFORT] -The bridge is ready. Now, you've free to pass to the other side. [BABY CONTINUES CRYING] [LAUGHING] [BABY CONTINUES CRYING] -There, there now. Sir, I would like to express my gratitude to you. -You don't owe me anything. -I'm sorry, I do not have anything with which to repay you. But perhaps I can do something which can be useful to you, just the same. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] -Can you see into the future? -I see a dragon. And you, sir, are fighting against him. -Dragons don't exist anymore. -[GASP] It's enormous. Why, it's stretched all the way from China to India. And the flames from its jaws are reaching Europe. Why, it's the Mongols and you, stranger, will have to fight them all alone. [SWELLING MUSIC] PROPHETESS: It is the year 1227. Far from here, Genghis Khan emperor of Mongolia had died. The funeral pyre's ready. Among his counselors I see Getinye the wise old prophet, who was his trusted advisor. I see the emperor's three sons. Each is a tribal chief. You will fight them all. And there is Kin Khan, his name means hurricane. His strength is incredible. Next Sayan, his arrows never miss their mark. And Susdal, he uses a whip with incomparable skill. -At the time of his death, the emperor Genghis Khan bade us make peace with the West. Mongolia wants peace with its neighbors. This was his last wish, and we must obey. -But his sons have long harbored a desire for further conquest and power. However, they need an incident to incite their people to war. So Getinye's death will serve as their excuse. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Ongree, receive the body of Genghis Khan. [GETINYE GROANS] [CONFUSED CHATTER] MONGOL 1: Here comes Sayan. Maybe he knows who did it. -The white man's arrow. White men have the [INAUDIBLE]. [MONGOLS SHOUTING] MONGOL 1: Let's go. MONGOL 2: Let's go. -The wise Getinye was grateful to my father all his life. Let us avenge him. -We'll burn their homes. We'll destroy them all. We'll avenge the death of Getinye. -Nothing will stop us now. -We'll create an empire that will embrace the entire world, gold, women. We'll be the lords of the earth. -I was the favorite of my father, the great Genghis Khan. My father gave me this beast as a reward for my courage. You and your tribes must be courageous, too. This Lion comes from Africa. He is trained to hurl himself against our enemies. We must learn to fight like him, striking swiftly and without mercy. [LION ROARS] [MUSIC] -Ha, not one tribe has failed to come with us. -Our father would have been pleased with this spectacle. -I'm not so sure that this is what he meant by making peace. [THREE SONS LAUGH] -My army will lead the attack on the city of Tudela. -We, too, will attack from the rear. -Then on to Tudela, come on. [RIDERS SHOUTING] [MARTIAL MUSIC] [RIDERS SHOUTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] [GROAN] [GROAN] [HORSES GALLOPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] -Attack. -Let go, you dirty savage. -Kill the men only. I recognize you. You're Count Bernard, chief adviser to the king. You came to our camp when you were negotiating a treaty for peace. -But now, you've attacked us. But, why? -Where's your master? -We've killed him. We will bring his head to you as proof. -And his children, Bianca of Tudela and the heir to the throne, Prince Alexander? -I don't know. -You'll tell me. My method for making you talk won't fail. [ANXIOUS DISCUSSION] -Hurry, hurry. LADIES IN WAITING: No, no, no. [MENACING MUSIC] [WOMEN SCREAMING] -Which one of you is Bianca of Tudela? Did you hear me? Answer me. -Wait, Kin Khan, don't hurt them. KIN KHAN: Oh, it's you, Lee Wan. Speak or I'll beat you until you do. -But why do you want to mar their white skin. I don't like my slaves scarred and bruised. Why don't you give them to me? -You know I can't refuse you anything, my sweet. -Then they're mine? -Yes, but first I must know which one of them is Bianca of Tudela. -I'll think of a way. [WOMEN SHRIEK] -Kin Khan, our prisoners confessed. Alexander, the king's son, has escaped with some others. -Escaped? We must find him and kill him at once. We must kill all the legitimate heirs to the throne of Tudela. Your brother Sayan has already gone after him. [BIRDS CHIRPING] -Ah, now I understand. You want the roof of your house put back. [MENACING MUSIC] -Why are you moving those trees? -And what are you doing in this forest? -I'm escaping. -Alexander, Alexander. Alexander, where are you? -The Mongols want to torture Bianca. They're bad men. I should have stayed next to her. And now there's no one to help us. [CRYING] -Listen, Alexander. you don't have to cry anymore. -Alexander, where are you? FEMALE REFUGEE: The Mongols! [MOANS IN GRIEF] FEMALE REFUGEE: The Mongols are coming. Help. [REFUGEES SHOUTING IN PANIC] -(RELIEVED) Oh, here you are. Come and hide over here. [MENACING MUSIC] [HORSE WHINNIES] [MONGOLS CHEER] [LAUGHS] [HORSE WHINNIES] -Oh, for-- [GROANS] I'll get you for that. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] [MARTIAL MUSIC] [MONGOLS CHEER] [HORSES WHINNY AND MONGOLS SHOUT] [ HORSE WHINNIES AND MONGOL GROANS] [LAUGHING] -You and I will meet again. -I hope not, for your sake. [LAUGHING] -He won. We're saved. [LAUGHING] -Now, you don't have to be afraid. -No, but I'm hungry. -(LAUGHING) I'm sure you are. -But there isn't anything to eat here. -There is always something to eat. -Ha. I want to tell you a big secret. [FLOURISH OF HORNS] -What do you want? -The same thing you're after. Which one of them is Bianca of Tudela? [MONGOLS CHEER] -I'll bet you ten horses that you cannot do it in three tries. -Which one of them is Bianca of Tudela? SAYAN: It's the end of you, if you don't talk. KIN KHAN: I'll smash you to a pulp, if you don't tell us. [MONGOLS CHEER] -If you say who are, you'll suffer even more than he. -He'll tire of torturing him. [MONGOLS CHEER] [HORSE WHINNIES] [MONGOLS CHEER] -We'd better finish him. -I am Bianca of Tudela. LADY IN WAITING 1: No, I am Bianca of Tudela. LADY IN WAITING 2: No, it's not true. -No, I am. -No, I am Bianca. LADY IN WAITING 3: I am. LADY IN WAITING 4: No, I am. -Ah. This one's for me. My brothers can have the rest. -You can't make this decision alone. This woman belongs to the three of us. -No, to the best of us. -And I'm the best. -None of you has the right to decide about her. And you know it. Our laws demand that there is always a tournament to decide who is the best. The winner will have Bianca of Tudela, and along with her the city and her lands. [CROWD MUTTERS] -Get back up there. -Give the princess the special cell. [MENACING MUSIC] [MENACING MUSIC] -Adol! -Yes, Bianca. -They've taken you too. -Torture him. [SCREAM OF PAIN] [CRACKING WHIP] -Adol. -Oh, Bianca. They tortured me, Bianca. They're without pity. It's the end for everyone. But I only want to try to save our country from these barbarians. It's possible, you know, to reunite the soldiers that escaped and the peasants. They only lack of means. -The means? -Yes, money, gold. Unfortunately, with the death of your father, the treasury of our country disappeared with him. He never confided where it was hidden. And maybe he was right. -I know where it is. -You mustn't tell them. -Look. Look over there. It's hidden inside that gristmill in a hollow under the millstone. -No, right under the eyes of everyone. It's astonishing. That's why no one ever succeeded in finding it. You'll be the queen, I'm sure of it. ATTENDANT: You're here. They're waiting for you. -Good. -You know, those men of yours nearly killed me. -It is difficult to convince a Mongol just to pretend to torture and kill. -I've completely won over the confidence of Bianca. She believed everything I told her. Don't worry. Now I know where to find the treasure of the king. -Hmm. You've done well, Adolphus, I am pleased with you. -Remember that you promised me half of whatever we find. When do you think we can safely remove the treasure? -There's no rush. I trust my brothers, and they trust me. They mustn't be suspicious. -Well, then. -I'll tell you when. [MUSIC AND LAUGHING] -They fled before my men like flies. -Thank you, Lee Wan. SAYAN: Have them bring more wine. KIN KHAN: And some food, that's what I want. -There's a man outside that wants to speak with you. -No one can be brought in to speak to us without our orders. Why did you let him in here, anyway? -But it's Hercules. -What did you say this stranger's name was? -Hercules. -Then we must see this man. -Who is he? -Go on. -He has fantastic strength. He used a gigantic tree against us, as one would use a battering ram. Only it was very big. -I don't believe you. -I've heard the soldiers speak of it. -Yes, yes. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] -What do you want? -I have a safe conduct from your father, the great Genghis Khan. So I ask you to free me. -It's authentic. -It's false. -Throw him in the prison. -Take him away. I told you to take him away. [MENACING MUSIC] I see my brothers are afraid of him, but I'm not. [LAUGHING] [MENACING MUSIC] -Hurry! On with you. [INAUDIBLE] -Don't worry. We'll be free soon. -Thank you. -Bianca! You are Bianca, aren't you? -How do you know my name? Who are you? -Hercules. -My father has spoken of you many times. At least twice he sent someone to get you. But we never saw them again. -No one ever came to tell me. -Whoever he sent to find you never returned again. My father said that if you'd been in his service many of his problems would have been taken care of. And now, even you are a prisoner. -A voluntary prisoner. I wanted this, so I could reach you and see what I could do to help you. -Why, you're going to try to free me? -Well , that's why I'm here. I promised your brother. -You've seen him? -Yes, I spoke to him. [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC] -No, don't bother with me, but with him. Take him away from here quickly, to the king of Bratislavia. -We'll get out of here, I know. -I hope so, but when? -Tonight. I have studied the most favorable moment. -Watch out. -Don't be afraid. I'm alone I'm unarmed. I want to talk to you. (LAUGHING) Consider me your friend, Hercules. [LION GROWLING OFFSCREEN] -It was because of me that you were able to speak with Bianca of Tudela. Don't think it was just due to luck, Hercules. I was the one who arranged that you and Bianca would be together. -Why have you done this? What do you want from me? ADOLPHUS (WHISPERING): Bianca. -Who is it? ADOLPHUS (WHISPERING): Don't be frightened Bianca. It is I, Adolphus. At this time there are only a few guards on duty. -Did Hercules send you? -That traitor? What are you saying? -You're wrong, Adolphus. I'm waiting for him. He promised that he'd save me. -Hmm, you've fallen into his hands. That man is a mercenary. He sells himself to the highest bidder. -Please, stop. -You haven't told Hercules where he could find the treasurer, have you? -Yes, I did. And he'll help us to be free. -But don't you understand, Bianca? Now that he knows, he will try and get it away from you. He doesn't need anyone to help him lift the millstone from the machine. -Oh, don't. Have faith in him. -Hercules has an agreement with one of the sons of Genghis Khan. At this very moment they're pulling together. [LION ROARS] -You're the only one who can defeat them. You will challenge my brothers and you will fight them. But you will refused to fight with me. I'll give you gold and liberty. -And if I don't accept? [LION ROARING OFFSCREEN] -Then it would go badly for you and Princess Bianca. -I will compete in the tournament. [SUSDAL LAUGHING] [MARTIAL MUSIC] [CHEERING] -Before the noble and powerful sons of Genghis Khan contest with each other for the right to have Bianca of Tudela, the prisoners will have the opportunity to fight with them. If the winner should be a Christian, he will have the right to substitute himself for Bianca of Tudela, becoming a slave in her place, and she will be free. [NOISES OF UNRULY CROWD] [MONGOLS CHEERING] [MENACING MUSIC] -I ask that my brothers and I fight three of these slaves at the same time. RABBLE: Hooray, Hooray! [MONGOLS LAUGHING] [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC] [LAUGHING] [MONGOLS CHEERING] -If I win, will I be given the honor of taking the place of Bianca of Tudela? COUNSELOR: It is your right, but you won't win. [KIN KHAN GROANS] -Choose your weapon and fight like a man. -I don't need weapons. My hands are the only weapons I use. [KIN KHAN GROANS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [HERCULES GROANS] [MENACING MUSIC] -And now you, Susdal. [CRIES OUT IN PAIN] -You have won. -Free Bianca of Tudela. [COUNSELORS WHISPER] -We have decided we will maintain our promise. You can choose between your liberty and that of the woman's. -I repeat, free Bianca of Tudela. -Very well, put him in chains. -I will buy him. He is a slave, and I have the right. -He is yours. -A slave in chains does me no good. You must swear loyalty in the name of your god. -I and my people have always kept our word of honor. -You must swear by your god that you will obey every order of your master, that you will not try to escape or rebel, and you will be a faithful servant to him. -I swear. -You'll regret not having kept your word in our agreement. -And, now you are free. ADOLPHUS: Bianca. Your liberty is the proof of his being guilty. You're the only obstacle he had to remove to complete his plans. Now that you're going away, he'll have a free hand. You still don't believe me. You are too naive. You're convinced that he sacrificed himself for you. The truth is Hercules only sacrificed himself for his own greed. His only object is to take possession of the treasure. It is not just coincidence that he finds himself working near the gristmill because he's in agreement with Susdal. You heard Susdal, when he came to talk to him. -Yes, it's true. I remember. I heard his voice and saw his shadow in the cell of Hercules. Now I remember. -And weren't you surprised by their behavior. They were no longer two enemies. I should say two friends, even two accomplices. Then if you remember all of this you must hate him because Hercules is a traitor. [GUARD LAUGHS] -Bianca. -You traitor. Your noble gesture is hiding a deceitful motive, but you won't succeed. -But I don't understand, I gave my life for you. You gave your life for another purpose. I thank god that you weren't able to deceive my father. -You don't know what you're saying. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] -Get ready. GUARDS: All right come on. Move along. Hurry up. In here. Come on. Come on move. SUSDAL: Now, it's your turn. You must raise that pillar, all by yourself. If you don't succeed, they'll shoot all these prisoners. You must do it within ten beats of the drum. -Come on, all of you. Go on, lift it up. Up. Higher now. [SLAVES GROAN] GUARD: All of you by the wall. Go on. [MENACING MUSIC] -If Hercules should fail, it will be the hand of Genghis Khan that judges him. If by chance he should win, he will be accused of sacrilege. We'll tie him to the yoke. We'll take him far from here in the grotto to die of hunger. SAYAN: This is a great idea for our revenge. He'll be hungry, thirsty, and die. -Good for you, Sayan. -Have you any idea that it's better? -No, I don't. -(LAUGHING) He never has very much imagination. -Alexander will cause us a lot of trouble. And the Christians here tell me he is still living in Bratislavia. As long as he remains alive, he's a symbol. There must be no successor to the throne. -But if you're sure he's alive, we'll have to send someone to kill him. -I've found the right person. He is an agent, a spy. You already know who he is. All that remains to be done is to tell him to go and kill him. Alexander already trusts him very much. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] -I'd like to try to escape, but I hate to leave you here alone. [LION GROWLING] [LION CONTINUES GROWLING] [GRUNTS] [LION CONTINUES GROWLING] [PANTING WITH EFFORT] [LION GROWLING] [LION GROWLING] [HERCULES SIGHS] [MENACING MUSIC] -Halt. Orders from Kin Khan, the woman must return to Tudela. We will escort her back. -I'm free. I don't have to go back with you. -Kin Khan has given precise orders. -And I? -You? No, he said nothing about you. -You must rebel, Adolphus. Now's your chance. Help me. I beg you. -Lee Wan, you want you told me that I was free. -You are free. Now you do what I tell you, and you'll be saved. [HORSES WHINNY] [KIN KHAN LAUGHING] -Hey, Princess Bianca is here to see you. [KIN KHAN CONTINUES LAUGHING DRUNKENLY] -Get out of here. Bianca. [CONTINUES LAUGHING] -You know that I love you. I can not bear it if you choose another. -Where is Bianca? I don't want you. -Don't try to find her. Don't try to find her. -Why you-- -Ahh! [KIN KHAN LAUGHING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SORROWFUL MUSIC] -Where's Hercules? -The grotto. -Bianca is in Tudela. Kin Khan wanted to capture her. I saved her and she's safe now. I hid her in the dungeon. But I'm afraid he will find her before long. -I despise that woman. -I know Bianca wants to live only to see you again. By imprisoning Bianca, the Mongols have broken their promise. And you are now freed from your pledge. [GROAN] [GASP] [LAST BREATH] [MARTIAL MUSIC] -Your highness, the enemy has abandoned its encampment. It seems they have all returned the city of Tudela. -I don't trust them. We'd better destroy the Mongol's camp. [MARTIAL MUSIC] [ALARMED SHOUTING] -You can't give them the advantage of letting them attack the wall with their war machines. I am leaving with my cavalry, and I'll hit them the minute they get ready to attack us. You'll have to attack from the rear. -To avoid being noticed, I'll have to detour around the city walls. -You'll pass through the woods. -I will stay here. It is certain that they will attack the city. -All right. [MARTIAL MUSIC] [CREAKING OF STOCKS] [MARTIAL MUSIC] -Attack them. -It is too dangerous here. We have to get away. -Come on. Hurry up there. Get those ladders to the wall. -Come on. [MUSIC] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] -Hercules is fighting on our side. -Victory is ours. [GROAN] -But I am not afraid. -The King doesn't want you to get hurt in battle. But as I'm your friend, I can help you to perform a heroic deed. -Can you really? -I know where to find your sister Bianca. And it will be you who frees her, Alexander. -Very well. -Here is the situation. These are the walls. This is the city of Tudela. We are here. The Mongol cavalry has left this wall and is trying to encircle us. They are concentrated at this point in the woods. They could attacks from the rear, and we'd be annihilated. It's up you to prevent their cavalry from attacking us. We don't have the strength to fight on two fronts. -But, I must find Bianca. -I understand Hercules. Bianca of Tudela is certainly in the palace or hidden in the cellars. But the Mongols are determined to win, and we must stop them. And you are the only one who can prevent them from destroying us, so you must fight them. -I accept. -Good. Everything is being arranged. On your signal, the forest will be set on fire, and the Mongolian Cavalry will be trapped between the water and fire. [MUSIC AND SHOUTING OF RIDERS] -Get ready to attack. Follow me. [SHOUTING RIDERS AND WHINNYING HORSES] -There's a fire over there. Let's go the other way. -Oh, I didn't recognize you. -Do you know him? -And to think that these criminals are paid with our gold. -Then he is a spy. -He's useful to us. -Spies are always traitors. -Come on. [HORSES WHINNY IN PANIC] [PANICKED SHOUTING] -This lake's [INAUDIBLE]. I'm sinking. [COUGHING RIDERS] [HORSES WHINNY] -Help. Please, please help. Help, no. [HORSES WHINNY] -Is he a spy, too? -I have kept all of my promises. -And I will keep in mine. Now is the moment to act, while my brothers in the middle of battle. Only my men are in Tudela. -I'll need about 20 men. -You'll have them. -Traitor. [ADOLPHUS LAUGHING] -Traitor, traitor. Let me go. Traitor, you traitor. Let me go. Oh, let me go. [ALEXANDER GASPS] -You coward. ALEXANDER: Look out, Hercules. [GRUNT] [GROANING] [HEAVY BREATHING] -Hurry get over here. Lift it up. -He was right. [LAUGHING IN AGREEMENT] -Adol. [GRUNTING WITH EFFORT] -Come here. Cone here. -No, No! I'm afraid of you. Leave me alone. You monster. -Come on, I said. Go on. I've got a nice little room prepared for you. -Let me go. -In you go. Sorry, I can be here to listen to your cries of agony. [STONE SCRAPING] -No! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GROAN] [STONE SCRAPING] [HEAVY BREATHING AND GASPING] -There he is. -That is a fitting end for a traitor. -Bianca . Bianca. Bia-- Bianca. [STONE SCRAPING] [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC] -Forgive me for having suspected you. You were the one who saved us. [CHEERING CROWD] -God bless Hercules.
