Rescue One Baker to base, do you copy? Over. Roger, Rescue One, go for base. Over. We've got a visual on on Baylor's Peak, dangling, possibly unconscious. We can't do this ourselves, who do we have available? Over. Both teams are tied up already. Over. It's a 3- possibly 4-man operation. Any other support in the area? Over. It's a long shot but Michael Harris is listed as working the base at Thomas Ranch. Your discretion. Over. Roger that. We'd better hurry. Rescue One, out. I did it, again! Me! All by myself!! You hear me?! Thanks for the ride fellows but I sorta had other plans, you know what I'm saying? We got a call about a climber dangling unconscious up by Baylor's Peak, we've got a real bad storm moving in. I'm glad you guys were up here. Looks like we've been deputized. Michael Harris. As in the Michael Harris who climbed Astroman, in 4 hours and 20 minutes? Yeah, but I didn't free solo the Naked Edge in 59 minutes. Yeah, well you know, that was a misprint. Actually it was 56 minutes. 59! Hey, hey--Don't you guys have a chopper to fly or somethin'? Well, even at 59 minutes, it's an honor to be your partner today. Yeah, except for I don't do "partners." Strictly solo. Ok, boys, there he is. Can you land above him, on that crag? No, There's no way--not with the way this wind's kickin' up. It's not safe. We're gonna have to lower you down. There's no time for all that nonsense! Or, you could just go do something stupid like that! How you doin', brother? My name's Derrick Williams, I'll be your rescuer today. So let me get my hero thang on--gonna get you home. Go ahead, Harris. Bring it down, bring it down, to the right. Wave them off, this wind's kicking up again. Too late! You still want to go solo on this one? Very funny! OK, he's got it! You all set? He's secure! Good to go! I could of handled it on my own, you know. Yeah--right. He's stable now. All of his vitals are checking out. He's going to be ok. He sustained a nasty concussion up there, Mr. Leonard, but he's going to pull through-- he's really very lucky. Doc? Yeah. Thank you. How's he doin', Mack? He's going to be ok. What did you find out? Couple hotshot climbers managed to get him into the chopper. Pulled off quite a feat. Quite a feat? They saved my son's life. . . heroes, in my eyes. These rookies, they think just because Daddy's got a lot of money, and they can afford to buy a permit and the best gear in the world they can climb any mountain they see. But life doesn't work like that. See, it's what's in you that counts, now remember that. See, I taught y'all something again today. Where was I? Dangling from the rescue helicopter, baby. Dangling from the rescue copter, thank you, baby. So there I was, hangin' from this cable, me and the gurney. We were flyin' back and forth, it was spinnin' like a top in these 100-mile-an-hour winds, and I'm tryin' to get back to the ledge. Derrick, Derrick, it says right here there were 40-mile-an-hour winds. Yeah, but where I was-- underneath the chopper blades and everything-- it was 100 miles an hour. Chopper blades. Okay. It was a mistake. See, that's what you call a "misprint." I don't know why I talk to that paper anymore. They always do that to me! Anyway, the point is, that I'm a thousand feet above the rocks, just hanging by a thread, staring death. . . I think I found another "misprint." It says right here that it was a 500-foot drop. I ain't reading this lying paper no more. Finally, I make it down to the ledge, and I snap the gurney shut, and we're going to raise him up. Wait a minute, hold up, hold up. You telling me you did all this on your own? Yes, pretty much. Well what about this other guy whose picture is just as big as yours? Lucky for you it was Mack's kid up there with you otherwise you would not be on the front page. Hey, maybe you can talk his daddy into buildin' one of those discount stores in our neighborhood. Are you planning on wallpaperin' with all these papers? Well, yes, as a matter of fact I am. Cheryl ran out and picked these up. . . Ok, gotta go! because she figured y'all might want to get the autograph of a bona fide hero. Let's get out of here and go make some room for his head! But I love every square mile of it! This here is a good woman, y'all! Mark my words, good woman. All right who wants one first. Me. I'll make it out to a special. . . You think we've got enough chips over there or should I bring over some more? I'll tell you what you're gonna need more of-- somethin' to break that spell. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talkin' about, girl. You're playing with fire with that man. I know what I'm doing. Okay? Uh-huh. Many of you have read or heard about the heroic rescue that took place, on Baylor's Peak Friday. Our own Michael Harris was just half of the team that the Lord used to save a life just two days ago. Michael, would you stand please? Glad he's back safe and sound. Looks like I'm getting my 15 minutes of fame, huh, sweetheart? Black and white working in harmony with Mack's name attached. This is good, Mack, this is very good. Considering all the bad press we've been gettin' lately, I'd say it's very good indeed. Let 'em write all the negative stuff they want. It's not that simple, Greg I mean, when they write that Mack Leonard is not concerned with the people on the south side of town, that hurts. We're running a business here, not a social service, and putting a store in that neighborhood is just bad business. Look, Mack, one of my jobs is to make sure that feelings don't play a large role in what this company does. I know that, but there's got to be some kind of a, some kind of a balance. Of course there is. Look, your son's tragedy has turned out to be a PR windfall for your business. That's a negative balanced out by a positive. And it shouldn't stop here. We've got to take full advantage of this situation, this opportunity, and do something with these guys. Something big! Um-hum. Now that's a belay! This is called a Prussik knot-- you ever get into a jam, you can use it to work your way back to a fixed rope like this one. The only requirement is you gotta have muscles. He's sure got some muscles-- just take a look at that jaw. Hey, partner. How you doing? Hey Pablo, do me a favor and show these kids a few knots. Pablo will take care of you. I wanted to return these ice screws to you, you left 'em in the chopper. Keep 'em, I get 'em for free. It's one of the perks of managing this place. Manager, huh? Yup. Worked my way up from the bottom-- stock boy, salesman, supervisor, manager. Sounds like you're an "all-around" climber. So, I guess we landed a pretty big fish last Friday, huh? Yeah, it was in the paper and everything. I heard they even had our pictures in it. Chicanagua, huh? The north ridge. Yeah, that's her. It's my dream. Really? Mine too. No kiddin'? You see that little black dot right there? That's gonna be me. Somehow, some way, I'm gonna make it happen. You see that little white dot right there? No--it's just some snow. Hi, how are you? Derrick Williams? That used to be my dream. But reality has a way of catching up with you. Nothing's going to stop me. See, I'm gonna do it solo. You're gonna solo Chicanagua? Yup. You do realize how many teams have tried and failed? Yep. But you see I have this motto-- "Go big, or go home!" And for me, going home is just not an option. I will climb that mountain. Can I help you? Actually, gentlemen, I'm here to help you. Well, it's about time we met. Michael. Yes sir. And you must be Derrick Nice to meet you, Mr. Leonard. No, no, you boys saved my son's life, call me Mack. Might even put you in my will! I hear Josh is doin' much better. He's doing much better, he's a little wobbly, but they say he's gonna be fine thanks to you boys. Sit down. You know, when I was, when I was Josh's age, I used to get my kicks rodeoing. So you might say we're all swimming in the same gene pool here, if you know what I mean. Yes sir, we're all sort of nuts. There you go! And if you think that's nuts, wait till you hear what my man here has to say. Why don't you tell them about our little plan here, Greg? Mack and I were talking about heroes. How there just aren't enough of 'em to go around these days and how it just doesn't seem right that the kind of heroism and teamwork that you two displayed on that mountain shouldn't be commended in some special way. Oh, I don't know, I think that getting our pictures in the paper and all of that was commendation. . . Harris, let the man finish. Right on! We'd like you guys to show the public what Mackie's is all about-- teamwork, workin' in harmony. We'd like to run a series of ads here in Denver and throughout the West that says Mackie's is committed to building community. Now, as for the compensation, we happen to know that you both have your hearts set on something that at this point has been unattainable due to a lack of resources. Well, there it is: Mount Schicamawaga. Chicanagua. Chicanagua, whatever. The point is, that is a mighty high mountain. Our idea is to sponsor you boys in a climb to the top of that baby. What do you think? Mack, this sort of operation takes months of training, and preparation. Months! I know. It's a big commitment. Not to mention trusting another man with your life. It's everything I've ever dreamed of, Mack. Great! But um. . .the dream's always to do it solo. Solo? Yeah. Sorry. But you were climbing as a team when you rescued Josh! Yeah, well I didn't have a choice then, now, I do. But, this is your dream! Wait a minute, hold on a minute here boys. We're not trying to force anybody to do anything they're not comfortable with. Why don't y'all just talk it over. This is your life, your dream. We're just trying make it a reality for you. Okay? Just take your time. We'll be in here, alright? Just some things a man needs to do by himself, you know? Yeah, look. . . I know you want to make this climb on your own and I respect that. It would be a great accomplishment. But it's no less an accomplishment to climb with a partner first. You know as well as I do that we are never going to get handed a fully funded ascent of Chicanagua ever again. This is like winning the lottery. I've got a question for you. Do you want to "Go Big," or you want to "Go Home?" And that's why the Mack Corporation is proud to sponsor And that's why the Mack Corporation is proud to sponsor these local heroes up one of the highest and most dangerous mountains in South America: Mount ah. . .Chica. . . Chicanagua! Chicanagua! And we feel that Michael and Derrick here symbolize everything that Mackie's is all about: That is "Workin' hard together in Harmony," we also think that if we all here in this community work together, well I can promise you there'll be a better life for all! Does your "better life for all" include the people living in the south end, Mr. Leonard?! Well, I'll tell you what I do think, I think, that kind of question is counterproductive. And, as a matter of fact, we are gonna break ground on a new Mackie's in the south end this coming fall! Why don't you write that down? Go ahead, write it down!! Take a trip on a runaway ship with a destination course. Sorry to say it's not the same as the Magical Mystery Tour. Although you think you get it now you're really in for it Mackie's: Above the rest. Mackie's: Working together. I'm mad into the force. Mackie's: Working in harmony. Though you're scared I really don't care 'cause I know what is best. You're in good hands for the future plans already decided. lf all you care is the promise there it's not entertainment. I'm mad into the force. Can we go now? Just one more, baby, just one more. Ok, that was one more--let's go! No, one more roll, baby, can you toss me one? You've shot three already, Derrick! I'm just trying to make sure it comes out alright. I mean, Look! This is bigger than life! Look at it! Oh yeah, look; they've made your mouth even bigger too! Mack said we have a full-page ad in today's paper. Alright Mr. Big Shot, let's go. We will, just want to see the ad. And pay for those! I will, just as soon as I find the ad! Oh, come on man! Are you saying I should go back on my word? What I'm saying is, you got ahead of yourself again, Mack. We've already got too many properties in the development as it is. I can afford it. No, you can't! Look, let me handle this, alright? Don't worry about South End, I'll take care of it. Let's just talk about this later. Cut! Perfect! I love it! But maybe just one more-- first positions, everyone. He said that four takes ago. Relax, man, this is how it's done in Hollywood. Well, if it's perfect, why do another one? Action, fan! Action, snow! Where's that snow? Give me more wind! I want a blizzard! Okay, Michael, we're climbing, we're reaching. The final thrill of victory! And we. . .CUT! Alright, let me down. Get me down! You get that? No. Going again, one more time, quickly everyone. He said one more, we did one more--I'm outta here. Where are you goin' man? We'll never get up Chicanagua unless we get in some real training. I've been training for years. We're supposed to train together--we're a team remember? Hey, lighten up and enjoy the ride, man. This is all part of the package. Let's just try to make everybody happy. Well, I tell you what--you make me happy--be at the Crest sunrise tomorrow, just you and me. Hey, where does he think he's going? Home. I tell you, he won't back off. All this negative press has finally gotten to him. He sees this as his big chance to redeem his reputation-- the big-hearted humanitarian who cares about the community. Listen to me for a second. The stock on Mackie's is going down because of his "humanitarianism." Now as a major stockholder, I'm not happy about that. Mack is stubborn! No, Mack has lost his business sense! He's not using his head anymore; he's gone soft. You just make sure that store is killed. I'll do what I can. No, you'll just do it. What about this mountain-climbing thing? Are you kidding? That's the best press we're getting--it stays. I'm serious baby, I don't know if I can work with this Harris guy. Well, maybe he's right-- they need to give you two some space to get in some real training. Well, that may be, but that doesn't give him the right to start barkin' orders at me. "Make me happy-- be at the Crest, sunrise!" Look, all I know is, when all this is over, I don't want to be left with a bunch of memories and photographs. I want you, okay? Oooh, baby, come on now, I'm comin' back. Don't you know. . . nothin' in this world can keep me away from you. . . . . .except him. Those must be the dirtiest dishes in the world. They started washin' 'em over an hour ago. Joseph, please. We'll be late and you two behave. Don't we always, Bea? Humph! Brrrr--I feel warmer in my underwear at 15,000 feet. Guess your old man doesn't think I have what it takes either. Now you know you should not take that personal. My daddy does not trust anybody with his baby girl. Yeah, but doesn't he know that you're my baby girl, too? Yes, I told him and that's why he doesn't trust you. Oh--daddy's a very. . . smart. . .man. Mornin'! Let's settle some issues right off the top. I'm here because we already planned on being here. Not because you ordered me here. I don't take to being told what to do, especially the way you did it at that sound stage. You know what? What? You're right. I guess I just sort of had it with that director. I'd eaten enough fake snow for one day. I was worn out. But I shouldn't have gone off on you like that. I'm sorry. Yeah. . . ok. . .that's cool. You ride all the way up here? Yup. You sure you haven't had your workout already? That was just my warm-up. What? You meditatin' or somethin'? Or somethin'. "Day by Day" with Billy Graham? Oh no--you're not one of those born-agains, are ya? Yeah, I'm a Christian. lf it makes you happy. It's not about being happy. It's about what's really important in life. Nothing's more important than climbing. Since we're gonna be spending a whole lot of time together, I think you should know something--I'm not religious. I don't buy it, never bought it, and I really don't want to be tied to somebody who's gonna be preachin' at me all day. Well, I don't preach. Good. But I do speak my mind. That makes two of us. You'd better not run that out too far. Oof! I told you not to run it out that far! What are you doing-- you playing with me? Just testin' your belay, man. Yeah, well it works. Very nice. Nice. . .very nice! You gonna hot dog on Chicanagua?! Maybe. I told you, man, I take everything to the edge, baby. Whew! That would have hurt. Every time out with this guy's a surprise. Did I tell you that Mr. Cool turns out to be a Jesus freak? MichaeI's a Christian? Yeah, but he's not like you. See, he's one of those extreme, read the Bible every day, memorize the scripture types. Oh, yeah, not like me. Come on, baby, you know what I mean. Hey, let's not start with the God thing. Not tonight. So, is he a good climber? I'll give him that. But his style's way too uptight, too planned. He's gonna have to loosen up. Maybe he's just being safety conscious. That's what worries me! We'll get halfway up Chicanagua and he'll realize there's a storm blowing and instead of attacking the summit fast and loose, he's gonna want to turn around and head home! And if we do get in a jam, will he be able to think fast or is he gonna want to stop and pray about it? But of course, you won't get into any jams, right, Derrick? Not me, baby. . .not me. Remember this? Huh? When we first met. Yeah. Just to be with you. Hi, I'm lookin' for Derrick Williams. Hi, I'm Cheryl, Derrick's girlfriend. He's talked a lot about you. Oh, he's talked about me, huh? Well, when he's not talking about himself. Yeah. He's talked a lot about you, too. I don't know if I ought to hear that. No, it was good, well, mostly--from my point of view, it was. Alright, see ya, baby. I'll be back for dinner, that is, unless of course, Safety Man here wants to take things slower. ln which case I'll be back a week from Thursday. At least he'll be back in one piece. It's a crutch, man. That kind of faith is for people who don't think they can get the job done themselves. You know what I got faith in? A good solid cam, a strong rope and me. Besides it's a little misplaced, don't you think? I don't know if I'd be putting all my trust in a father who lets his own son die? What's his dyin' 2000 years ago got to do with me today? See what I'm saying? It'd be real nice if there was some bearded old man in robes up there that was gonna make everything turn out alright, but I grew up a long time ago. There ain't no tooth fairy and ain't nobody gonna look out for me, but me. Yeah, that's one more for you old man!!! You hear me, Pop?!!! I came, I saw, I conquered!! Who you hollerin' at? Nobody. You sure sound angry. It's none of your business, alright? And if I sound angry, it's cause we're never gonna make it up Chicanagua if you keep taking 20 minutes on every cam! I got a news flash for you. We're never gonna make it back if you don't stop hot-doggin'! You gotta rethink your whole style, man. It's way too cautious. I wouldn't have to be so cautious if you'd just stop and think for 20 seconds before you risk both our lives. Look, there is no forgiveness up there, at all. You make a mistake, you die. And if you don't take it to the edge every chance you get, you're dead already, baby. Give me a break--there's a huge difference between taking it to the edge and foolishness. You callin' me a fool?! No. . .no, I'm just saying that we don't have a chance of making it up that mountain if we don't start thinking and training like a team. Ok, so then follow me, "teammate." You're up late. I'm just doin' some reading. I hope you're not in the Book of Judges tonight. Should I be? Hey, hold up, whoa. . . come here, sit down here for a minute. Cheryl, I'm your father. lf I see you making some poor choices, I've got to speak up. Years ago you told me that I was old enough to make my own choices. And I respected you for that. Now all I ask is that you respect the choices that I make. Derrick is. . . Derrick is a good man, Daddy. An angry man. Because he's hurting. Maybe you can't see that. And if you can, maybe you just don't care, but I do. You are in a relationship with a man who doesn't share your values. Now when the storms come, and believe me they will come, what's gonna be your compass? Whose values will decide? We love each other, Daddy. Our values will decide! Oh, Cheryl. . . everything. . . and I mean everything comes with a price. Good-night, Daddy. Good-night, baby. You really are a gadget freak, man. Look at this-- you got your GPS, your altimeter, your portable toothbrush set. What have you got in here anyway?. Oh come on, man, Dex?! You don't need this stuff. It's just in case one of us runs outta juice up in the death zone. Dex is for wimps, man. This is about man against nature. Oh, right, what was I thinking? Okay, look at this. I'm thinking we start here at base camp, head southwest, up through the San Carlos pass. Ok, good so far. And hit the east ridge here. No, no, no the east ridge has been done. It's boring! There's no challenge in it. There's plenty of challenge on the east ridge. Come on, man, we gotta do somethin' trailblazin' here. Look--check this out. How do you steer this thing? Look-- from base camp, we go north, then we tippy-toe around this gully here, bivi here on day 2, then we attack the summit from high camp here. You do know that Covington lost his life last year on the North ridge? He was climbing solo, by the way. Yeah, well with all due respect to the dead, Covington didn't know jack squat about what he was doin'. What are you talking about? He only summited Everest twice, Annapurna, K-2-- I think he knew what. . . Blah, blah, blah--I'm tellin' you, we can do this, man. I don't know, North Ridge is. . . What? Dangerous? I thought that was the point. No, the point is, to get to the top, and come back alive. Relax man, I'm not trying to get us killed. Just come close! You want somethin' to drink? Yeah, anything. Who's the babe? Girlfriend? No. Ex? Nope. Want to help a brother out here, man? She at least got a name? Renee, she was my wife. It comes out! She split on you, didn't she? Yeah, sort of. . . she died. Alright, let's not push it, it's slippery here. Come on, hey watch that hold, alright? I got it. You alright? No. Hold on. Ouw! I smashed my knee coming over that lip. Can you climb? Probably not the best idea. Here's what's left of my cell phone. That cinches it. Guess I gotta climb outta here and go get some help, huh? Be right back. Wait a minute-you're gonna climb this overhang, whip over the verglass, rep down the Bowl and be back here in the morning? That's a pretty good plan B. Plan B? What you got, a plan A? Yeah, leave a prearranged check-in call for 8:00. That way when we don't call, they know something's wrong and they come looking for us first thing in the morning. Yeah, well, that would be fantastic if one had actually taken the time to ah-- you did that, didn't you? Yeah, I did that. So, ah, that would make you the smart guy, wouldn't it? Pretty much. Safety Man. He delivers. My sister married this guy in Phoenix, and she wanted my mom near her. They all hate the cold. Yeah, I know how they feel. What about your dad? You mean the guy who happened to be there when I was conceived? He took off when I was 10. Derrick, I'm sorry. Don't be. . .I'm not. Did you ever hear from him again? Nope, don't know where he went or why. I always figured he traded up-- you know, new wife, new kids. Then one morning we got this call saying they found his body in a hoteI all alone. Suicide. Chumps way out. So ah, since we're laying all our cards on the table here, what about you? Tell me about your old man. You don't want to hear about that. Hey, I opened up here, it's your turn! Well, actually, he's my hero. Moving off the dad track. . . tell me about her. She was in a ah, car accident. She was driving home from work and ah, a guy ran a red light. She never made it out of ICU. I was ah, climbing that day. I had free-soloed Liberty Spire. She hated it when I did stuff like that. But I always told her it's safer than driving. How long ago was this? 2 years, 3 months and 18 days. Maybe it's time to ah, I don't know. . . start lettin' the healing in. Maybe you're right. Are you takin' my advice?! Yeah, I guess I am. God works in mysterious ways. There's our ride. As the two climbers prepare for their departure As the two climbers prepare for their departure to the southern tip of Chile, there is hope and optimism that the common dream of two men will soon be realized on one summit. ln the meantime though, there are still concerns as to the other story regarding Mack Leonard, and that is the continued delays in the promised store in the south end of the city. Hi, I'm Mack Leonard. Your local Mackie's Super Store is committed to building community--your community. See, we believe that working together in harmony is more than just a good slogan, It's a good idea. Stop by and see us; tell them Mack sent you! Mackie's: Above the rest. I'm Mr. Derrick Williams and I'm the King of the Quarry. You are all my subjects! It's more like this: "Go Big, or Go Home!!!" He has got you man. I do not walk like that! Nobody walks like that! You walk like that! Worst part is, this is how he climbs mountains. You think we can make that. . . ridge over there? Hold my drink, baby. Y'all check this out here. Right? Check my partner's style right here! Michael Harris. . . Now, this is him on level ground, alright? Both of you look like proud peacocks out there, man. Let me get you some ice. Great, thanks. You're not going to put that commercial on again are you man? Come on, man! Oh, man! You know that day you came by? Yeah. I don't want you to get the wrong idea. Derrick andI aren't living together. But there has been some compromise on my part. Why are you telling me this? I don't know, I guess, hearing Derrick talk about you and your faith just made me feel like I'm not living mine very well right now. Well look, we all go through periods like that. I've sure made my share of mistakes. I always try to remember this thing that my dad used to say to me whenever I blew it: he just said, "When you get to the next turn, try and take the high road." It sounds like God might be speaking to you about something, and if he is, you need to listen. Thank you. You look a little bit like Michael Jackson. There he is! You like that move? That is a brilliant commercial. When you gonna start buildin' that store you been promotin'? Yeah, Derrick, where's that Mackie's you promised us?! You know, South End could use a Mackie's. I didn't promise you anything, alright? You want a Mackie's, talk to Mack. Yeah, right. What are you talking about-- they haven't broken ground yet? Don't hold your breath on that one, Michael. The only thing he's broken is his word. You think everybody had a good time? Yeah, what about you? I'm still havin' a good time. Are you? Yeah. Not tonight, Derrick. Not tonight? Come on, there's nobody here. Can you think of a better time? C'mon, we can just pick all this up tomorrow. It ain't going nowhere. I'm not staying the night tonight, Derrick. Alright, what'd I do? Nothing. It's not you. Come on, I'm a big boy, you can tell me. It's me. . . I don't know, I just feel like it's time I just start doin' what I know is right, you know? I think it's time we start takin' the high road. Taking the what? The high road! Whoa! I'm a low-road kind of a brother. So you gonna have to explain to me what "taking the high road means", cause I don't know nothing about that. You know what? It's late. Let's talk tomorrow, okay? I'd rather talk tonight. Or not talk. Tomorrow. No, no, we can talk tonight. I'm just going to be up all night anyway. lnsomnia. Bye. Bye. "High road?" Michael, these things are complicated. The timing just hasn't quite worked out yet. Timing? Mack said you were gonna build a new store. I just want to know when that's going to happen. Where's Mack anyway? I want to talk to him about this. You're talking to the man in charge on this one. Mack's out of town for two weeks. Fine, I'll call him. Where is he? Michael, I don't tell you how to climb because the fact is, I don't have a clue. So don't tell us how to run our business. But my picture is plastered all over town because we had a deal! The deal was about climbing a mountain--nothing more. This whole thing is a scam, right? You guys have only been in it for the publicity. Well let me tell you something, it's about to stop. I don't know if you value your integrity, but I certainly value mine and it's not for sale. How dare you question my integrity! You start building that store or I'm going to pull out of this climb. Why don't you put that on a billboard. Yeah, Yeah. Thanks. ldiot!!! Not now, baby. We gotta talk. Later, alright? I've got some business I got to take care of first. This is more important. Nothin' is more important than me climbing that mountain. So everything else is just gonna have to wait, sorry. I'm pregnant! What? I'm going to have a baby. Our baby. Wait, wait a minute, Cheryl. Cheryl, I'm not ready to be a father. Well, you already are. This wasn't part of the plan! It's time to find a new plan, Derrick! It's that simple, isn't it? So, what do you plan on doin'? What do you plan on doing? It's your body, it's your call. This is our baby!!!! I can't even believe you're talking like this! What do you expect me to say? "Baby, I love you? Baby, let's get married, let's have a family?" Reality check, baby. I must have been crazy to think I could change you!!! You said you never really knew your father, right? Well, congratulations-- you're just like him. UGH! You are not going to quit on me, Harris! This is my shot! I'm not going to just let you slam the door shut in my face! The door's not shut-- they've just got to come clean on their promise and start building that store. That's not gonna happen, and you know it! When I give a man my word, it's real. And when a man gives me his word, I hold him to it! They lied to us. You quit being so naive, you boy scout! When Mack said he was going to open up a store in the south end, that was for the cameras. Alright? For the Press! They don't care about us, they're in this for themselves. We've got to be in this for ourselves. So just forget about everybody else, is that it? That's the way the game's played, bro'! That's not the way I play it! There are some things that are just more important than climbing a mountain! Not to me, so you just make a stand on your own time, alright? No, I'm through with this. From now on, I'm going to take the high road. It was you! What? You're the one that put all that "high road" talk into CheryI's head, then she comes home talking to me about how things are gonna start changing between us. Maybe some things needed changing. You know, for a second there you almost made me forget why I like going solo. "No one comes to the Father except through Me." No one comes to the Father except through the Son! We're going to have to see about getting you back up on Baylor's Peak before too long. Definitely. Look, Michael, no promises, but I'll see what I can do. I think I know who fouled up this whole thing. Great. Well listen, Josh, I really do appreciate it. Alright, take care. So long. Lord Jesus, help me. I am so sorry. Forgive me. Was it me? Come on, Pop, here I am, man. You proud of me now, Pop? Alright buddy. Did you see my commercial? C'mon, man, just put that thing down--just toss it here. Hey, it's not a THlNG! It's a titanium alloy ice ax-- on sale now at The Quarry, if you hurry on down you could-- Hey, hey, hey, I go solo, pal. Put the ax down, sir, stay where you are. Alright, don't shoot, I give up. From now on I take the "high road." Good, just take it easy. Alright, just take it easy. That's the problem, brother. I take nothing easy! I'm Derrick Williams andI take everything to the edge! Alright sir, just give me the ax, sir. Sir, give me the ax, please. Whoop! Whoop! Come on man, come on down. Give me the ax!!! I Gotcha! Whooo! Now THAT'S a belay! Hey, what are you doing? Thank you, Carole. He's coming in. Josh! Mack! How are you doing, Greg? I thought you were in Dallas for the week! I'm sure you did. What's up? You are--actually, you're not up, you're out. You're fired. I'm sorry? Are you? Good! Well, if I were you, I'd get on outta here, pronto. Before I call the feds, or the SEC or your mommy. For what? Forgetting that you work for me. You ever have any secret meetings with any of our shareholders, Greg? Maybe been on their payroll? You can't prove a thing! Oh yeah? You want to see the file or you just want to walk outta here like dad suggested? Excuse me, but what is that file? I don't know, I just grabbed it off your desk. Chip off the old block! Also today, the Mack Corporation announced it is making good on its pledge to break ground on a new Mackie's Super Store in the south end, one of the more economically depressed areas of the city. It has long been thought that the decision by Mackie's is the trigger needed to spur other local business leaders to invest in the area. Yes! Yes! Oh. . .ouw. You're a little bit late for church. Yep. Story of my life. How you been? Ok, how about you? I'm still me. That was a pretty good stunt you pulled off with Mack. Josh helped. Look, I'm not any good at this. I just came by here today, you know, to tell you that I lost it, and I was wrong. I should've talked to you first. Maybe we both blew it. You know, I talked to Mack. And they're still up for it if we are. And you know I'm up for it. Well, let me think about it, okay? Yeah, sure, take your time. Hey ah, where you goin'? Home, I guess. I don't think so. Going home is not an option. North Ridge? North Ridge! It is the classic pursuit of the dream for Derrick Williams and Michael Harris, two American alpinists, who have set out to conquer what is said to be one of the most dangerous mountains in the world. The South American, Andean Giant, Chicanagua. Widely recognized in the United States for their advertisements for Mackie's discount superstores, the climbers arrived in Santiago, Chile this morning. They were met here in Patagonia by legendary New Zealand mountaineer, Carl Douglas, who's been hired to organize the trek. Months of vigorous preparation and training now behind them, the team will establish themselves at a 17,000 foot base camp for two weeks of acclimatization. Kinda takes your breath away, eh boys? But don't let those good looks fool you. That's what a dozen dead climbers would say if they had the chance. Well, we've got two weeks of training ahead of us before your three-day climb to the summit. One thing I want you to study is the snow itself. The North ridge is dangerous enough. This time of year is the most treacherous. It's getting into the warmer season, that means we can expect two things-- snow slides and avalanches. You've always got to watch where you step, what ridge you traverse, where you camp. Remember, there's a reason they call Chicanagua Muerte Blanca--White Death. I'll be watchin' your backsides. Don't forget, once you reach high camp, you'll be right below the death zone, your bodies will be pleadin' for oxygen, so plan that summit bid wisely. Good luck, God's speed, mates. Little close to that ledge, huh, partner? Feels pretty solid. Just watch that belay! Yeah, no problem. Whoa!!! Oof!!! You okay? Yeah. I'm coming up. Michael!!! Come take a look at this. You think that was that British guy, Covington? Yeah. He didn't even make it into the death zone. It might have happened on the way up or maybe he fell from it. Doesn't really matter, we're always in a death zone. Meaning? No one gets off the planet alive. We're all going to meet The Creator someday. It's best to be prepared, make your peace. That's easy for you to say. Derrick, you're carrying around a lot of baggage that you've got to cut loose. Otherwise it's just gonna eat you up. Eventually you've just got to move on. It's not that simple. You want to take it to the edge? You really want to go big? Just give it up. Whatever it is that you're holding on to, whatever it is you feel like you've got to prove. Just give it up. Give it to God. Let Him be your father. I don't believe in that sort of thing. You don't, or don't want to? It sure sounds like you're preachin' now. No, I'm just giving you some advice. You know, a wise man once said to me, "Maybe it's time to start lettin' the healing in." A wise man, huh? Yeah, or a fool. I can't remember which. Time to get up, boys this is the day! Yeah, go Carl. We might have some weather coming in from the south. Thought you might want to get an early start for the summit. Over. Alright, thanks, Carl. We'll get back to you in 15. Over. Roger that, Michael. Out. Now it could fizzle out, but better to be on the safe side. Alright, so that means we've got about 18 hours up and back. Roger that. Oh, this just came in from Mr. Martin. Said to tell Derrick that he had to admit Cheryl to the hospital, just a little false labor, but she's doing well. She's resting, and the baby's heart rate is normal. Do you copy? Yeah, I'll let him know. Alright, good luck, mates! Thanks, Carl. Talk to you from the top. Out. I had a feeling there was something you weren't telling me. It's none of your business. What are you going to do about it? I'm not even thinkin' about it right now. Maybe you ought to start thinking about it. We got a job to do. Forget about the climb, Derrick, this is really important. I don't need you to tell me what's important. Maybe you do. That's right, you're an answer man, Right? Safety man-- pretty much perfect. It's not about being perfect. It's about taking responsibility for your actions. You wanna' pick those up? We're gonna need them. Come on, partner, let's do this. Yes, this is it! Yes!!! Whooo!!! WHOOO!! YEAH!!! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!!! Thank you, God. Thank you. . .thank you. Good-bye, Sweetheart. Thank you, Lord, for every day I had with her. There! ln your face, old man! Oh, oh Pop!!! Pop!!! Let him go! Can't! Let him go! You okay? Yeah. Carl, we made it. We're at the top! Way to go, mates! But listen to me, that storm turned on us, and it's coming right at you from the south. I repeat--that storm is coming straight at you. Get back down to high camp--right away! It'll take us 6 hours to get back down. We've got 3. Derrick? Derrick, come on! Come on, we've got to keep moving! Just give me a minute. Carl! Carl! Carl! Come in! Carl!! Carl!! I'm not getting anything. I think the batteries are frozen. I'm going to give you some Dex! No! No Dex. You need it! I don't want it, I can make it. Here, it's for later if you change your mind! I won't! We've got to get off this ridge before it gets dark. Come on, come on, get up. We've got to get some shelter. Let's go! Michael! Derrick!! This is base camp. Do you copy? Michael! Derrick! Come in! This is base camp. Phew! Okay, where are we? I don't know. But I know it's sure not the same way we came up. GPS is dead. It's a wonderful thing, technology. Well, we know we gotta head down. We're going to have some more weather coming in. Let's try and make that ridge before we're in it. Hurry. Let's get the packs. Derrick!!! I don't like the look of that overhang! We should go another way. Derrick! That overhang doesn't look too good!! Did you hear me??? Derrick!!! Derrick!!! Get out of there, Derrick!!! Watch out!!! Watch out!!!! Michael!!! Talk to me man!!! Where you at? I gotcha. I gotcha, partner, I gotcha. I gotcha, man, I gotcha, I gotcha. You made it. Yeah. Now look what you've gone and done-- Didn't know I'd have to carry you off this mountain but c'mon, bro'. . . come on, let's get you out of here.. Derrick. . . You alright? What do you need? I want you to call my father. Tell him that I love him. Tell. . .tell him, that I'm going home. Going home is NOT an option! So you can tell him yourself! Alright? You can tell him yourself! Come on, open your eyes. You open your eyes and look at me, Michael. You open your eyes and look at me!!!! Goin' home is NOT an OPTlON! We're going down the mountain, getting on an airplane!!!. Why'd you go and do that? WHY???!!! "See, if you're an expert and you're alert, you see these things coming and you just get out of the way." "Strictly solo." "It's what's in you that counts." "See I grew up along time ago. There ain't no tooth fairy." "I will climb that mountain." "Ain't nobody gonna look out for me, but me." "Nothings going to stop me." "Go big or go home." "lf you don't take it to the edge every chance you get." "Strictly solo." "You're dead already, baby." "There are some things that are just more important than climbing a mountain." "Not to me!!!" "I must have been crazy to think I could change you." "You hear me, Pop???" "You said you never really knew your father, right?" "I came, I saw, I conquered!!!" "You're just like him." "You're dead already, Baby." "You want to take it to the edge, you really want to go big? "Give it to God, let Him be your Father. Father, Father, Father, Father." Derrick!!. . .Derrick!! Alzare (I lift up) mis ojos (my eyes) a los montes. (to the hills.) Alzare (I lift up) mis ojos (my eyes) a los montes. (to the hills.) De donde vendrá mi socorro? (Where does my help come from?) Good morning. It is with a deep sense of sadness that I speak to you today, to commemorate the tragic loss of a great climber-- and a great friend. Not only of this city's, but a man I personally had grown to admire and respect, a man who paid the ultimate price in laying down his life for another. And so, in honor of our good friend, a real hero, the Mack corporation is very proud to announce that our new development in the south end, a community he cared about deeply and fought to make a difference in, will be dedicated to the memory of Michael Harris. Local mountaineer, Derrick Williams, returned home today after a harrowing climbing experience in the Andes Mountains. His climbing partner, Derrick Williams, says he owes his life to the heroic sacrifice his teammate and friend made on his behalf. Williams has asked that the media respect his privacy as he grieves the loss of his friend. He will wipe away every tear from your eyes. Death will be no more. Mourning and crying and pain will be no more. For the first things have passed away. We do not mourn the death of Michael Harris today, but we celebrate his life, Lord, the way he touched many of us. Father, greater love hath no man than he lay down his life for a friend. Mr. Martin, ah. . . You're no hero around here, Derrick. CheryI's not home. l, ah, I came to speak with you, sir. Um. . . You've heard about what happened on the mountain? Well, it got me to thinkin'. . . My whole life, I-I've been trying to prove something--to my father. Actually Sir, that's not even true. I've been trying to prove something to myself-- that I don't need him. That I don't need anybody-- I'm all I need. Sir, I was wrong. I am the most needy person I know. . . and I do not want my child to end up like that, like me. I need to ask your forgiveness. I've disrespected you, and I've disrespected your daughter, and. . .and I am truly sorry. You hurt our family. You ran from your responsibilities. You need more forgiveness than any of us can offer. You need to start by asking God's forgiveness. I-I don't believe that God will forgive me. Why-why would he even care? Well, well. . . What Michael did for you on that mountain is exactly what Jesus did for each of us. The Bible says that while we were still enemies of God, Jesus chose to give His life for you. . . and for me. Why would he do that-- I mean, for me? Because, Derrick, God loves you. You are of such great value to Him that He was willing to die in your place. He can meet any of our needs, if we're just willing to ask Him. I'm willing. Then tell the Lord-- tell him you need him; tell him you're sorry for going your own way. Ask him to forgive you for your for your mistakes. . . your sins. lnvite him into your heart. lnvite him in. Jesus. . . I-I need your forgiveness. I want to turn from my sins. I'm inviting you into my heart. Yeah, I know I told you the story a thousand times, but, hey, indulge me, alright. And this here, this is when we were doin' all those ads for that guy, Mack, I was telling you about, that rich dude. Yeah, Michael and I saved his kid's life. It's another misprint. They've got a picture of the wrong man! You know what, partner? Dad's gonna be busy for a few minutes. See that? Now, that's a belay. Where you going, Mikey?
