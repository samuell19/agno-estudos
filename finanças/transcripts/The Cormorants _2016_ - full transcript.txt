There he is. This way. The Cormorants. Boom! Look, there's a character from the 'Sniper' game. He was also in the film 'American Sniper'. Look... 'Hotel Room'. 'Ice Age'. I have that. I have that game. - '2K16'. - Where? You can put it on top and rest it against like this... But that was made for fixed rods. Only for fixed rods without reels. You plug the fixed rod above it. Yes... then you wait... Tick-tock, tick-tock... I don't like using a rod without a reel, though, because it's unsuitable for... feeder fishing. Who cares? You can still catch a lot of fish. You can catch fish only by using a float. If I come to Campo Felice, I'll bring a Roubaisienne rod and... - A seat basket. - Right, a seat basket. And I'll also bring... whatsitsname... a long one like yours that you can attach a weight to. But with a weight you never catch anything Matte. You need a feeder. (playing a game on their phones) - Can I swap these soldiers for those? - No, no! They suck! You can't add any more troops. They're not attacking enough Sam. Can they do it? Yes. But also add five lightning bolts. There's too much pressure. Boom! Not those ones. Fire all three shots. - Why? - Just do it. Boom! Boom! Charge! Bastards! Boom! Wait. - Holy shit! - It's alright. - Careful, it has thorns. - It doesn't have thorns. Ah, yes, it has some. Shall we break it in two again? Go! Go! You try now. One... - How are you going to break it here? - Well... Ouch! Go. - Put it there. - Get that one. Give it to me. Fuck! Matteo, I'll get a branch that is over there. Holy shit! - Try to pull it. - It has come off. Come here. Now let's prune it a bit. Wait a minute, Samu. - They've already ended it, right? - What? - The sale. - Yes, I think so. - Ask them how much they've made. - Wait. - Done? - Yes, wait. They've made... Loris: 1 euro... - Really?! - Yes. - Why? - I don't know. ...and Lino: 12 euros. Why did Loris earn only 1 euro? How would I know? Ask them why Loris only earned 1 euro. They told me he only sold a necklace. - Lino earned 12. And you? - Well, I made the sale with him. Half of 12 euros... 6 euros. Loris isn't a good sales person. - Matteo, are you still with Matilde? - No. Why? Dunno... well.. it was the summer, I couldn't see her anymore anyway. It's nice here, isn't it? Yes. How many times did you kiss her? - I don't know! - More or less. - Are you going steady with Iris? - No. - Is she still Marco's "kissmate"? - Yes. Actually, no, I don't think so. They had a falling out. - How many times did you kiss her? - I don't know! More or less. 2 or 3 times. - Have you been dating anyone, this year? - No. - Well done, single. - Thank you. You're welcome, single. Why didn't you tell me you two aren't together anymore? I don't know... It's been a while now. - How long ago? - How long ago... It's been two... two or three months. No, less... A month and a half. A while... half a month before school ended. - Who are you texting? - Simona. I hoped she would come. But her chair isn't there anymore. She won't be coming now! Maybe she just left. She has vanished! She's moved... to another road. I hear a car... or am I wrong? You're wrong. I'm not wrong... because she's coming! She's not coming... Here she comes! - Do you think she's Italian? - Dunno... - Bye love. - Bye. She doesn't have her chair anymore! It was too expensive. She's on the phone again. And again... Boom! Another client is on his way. Look... again! And again! She's got her phone right between her tits! Samu, would you ever fuck her? No! - Why? - Because I wouldn't. - Give me a reason. - She's ugly. - What if she was pretty? - No. - Why? - Because I wouldn't. - Come on, why? - Because I wouldn't. Give me a reason! No reason? No! - Because she's a slut? - Yes. - You? - No. - Why? - She's a slut. She's dirty. Do you know how many men have stuck their dicks in her ass? Samu? Samu? Samu? Sam... Fuck! - What should I ask her? - How much she charges. Come on! Come on! - Can't I ask her something else? - No. Only that. - Can I ask her... - No! - ...seventy and suck anything. - No, no, no... Don't even think about it. Was it an old old man like this one? Go! Don't change the subject. Come on! No. I'm not going. Come on, go! - What should I ask her? - How much she charges. For what? For everything. You should get her price list. Ten euros and a set of fishing hooks. You know, one of those kits with all sorts of hooks. - No. - Come on! - Look! this is an act of bravery. - Well, for 10 euros... - Plus a fishing hook kit. - 10 euros. 10 euros plus 10 floats. Okay. It's a deal. - Come on, go. - Shake my hand properly. - No, no. - Squeeze it tight. - Come on, go. - Hang on. - Should I go? - For all the stuff I'm giving you... Hi. And who are you? - Who, me? - Yes. What's my name? Matteo. - Hi, Matteo. - Hi. Thanks. A cone for me. Coffee and cream. Where are you going? "Samu..." If you think you understand... Read a bit with me... "Sa-mu-ele... is... a... dick... head." - Leave it alone! - Let me see how heavy it is. - Let's open it. - Why should we open it? - Let's see if there's paint in it. - Can't you hear? Yes, there is. Come on, let's open it. Then we'll close it again. Oh, damn it! Holy shit! How disgusting! Shit! How disgusting. Gross! It's coming out! It's coming out! Wait. Careful! Matteo... It's breaking. Gross! Spread it. Let's spread it. No, use this. Give it to me. We've left our handprints.

(indistinct dialogue) Look how red the wood is now. Get some wood, there's less fire now. But... Lorena, you know? Remember Lorena? - And now she's going to my school. - Umm... Was she in your class? I mean did she join your class? Yes. - She's not too geeky, is she? - More or less... So you tie the fishing hook to the line, as usual. I'll set up my rod when I'm there. If I tie the hook to the line, how can I attach the feeder to it? I'll do it for you. You'll watch and see how it's done. So I'll just bring the rod, without setting it up. Yes, just bring the rod. But fill the reel to its maximum. - Fill it full? - Yes. - Why? Will I need a lot of line? - No, but you'll cast farther. Okay... - Come on, Matteo. Are we going? - No Sam.. Come on Matteo! Matteo? Matteo? It's hot here. Since it's hot... Aahh! I'm cooling off... You bastard! It's hot here, isn't it? It's hot, isn't it? Oh, shit! - Look... it nearly fell into the water. - What is it? Wow! - It's going to crash. - Wow! If it falls into the water, it won't be able to fly anymore. Look, there's a fish... - What is it? - There was a fish this big. - Where? - It's gone now. Look here. There was a fish this big. It was this long. It weighed 5 kg! - Look... they're jumping there, too. - Where? Look Matteo... there are two cormorants. What the fuck are you saying?! They were there. Now they've gone behind the plant. Yeah, right! - See that large plant? - Yes. - They have a nest there. - How do you know that? - I just know. - Have you been spying on them? Look at that fish. It can't swim because the current is too strong. - Which one? - That one. It's blending in with the... It's staying still on purpose. All trout do that. They stay still. Yes! The big trout that was there before, was staying still, too. OK, but it was trying to move forward. Do you think it can't stay still? Yes, it can. But if it stayed still, it'd be immediately carried away by the current. Trout can swim upstream, you know? Yes, I know. Look at those two bubbles. Boom! - It's good, isn't it? - Yes. Let's increase the speed! Come on then, if you want to try. Come on, guys! Let's go even faster! Hang on, don't give up! Squeeze your legs! Go, young man! English subtitles by YRR & JX
