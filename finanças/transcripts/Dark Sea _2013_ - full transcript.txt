We could, at least, tell to the fishermen what we saw at the sea. You're crazy! Everyone will call you a liar, or say you're mad. Do you have any proof, boy?! -But we saw a mermaid! -Shut up, boy! Stop talking shit. If you tell this to someone I will say that is a lie Well understood? Lie! But, Snapper! I don't want them to call me a liar. I don't need another cross in my life! What is the cross that you carry, Snapper? Fishermen have no problem. Only bring what the sea gives free. I have problems. I have to do the maintenance of these boats. And come here and see these fish box almost empty! It was a very difficult day. What the fuck is this on your arm? It was a stingray. Damn, stingray? An experienced fisherman like you taking stingray sting?! Put hot lemon. People Say that it's a divine medicine. Damn, no snapper?! There is no more snappers here!
