I couldn't get a doctor. - Son. - Grandfather, please don't die. - I must go a way for a while. - I'll make you proud of me. When I grow up, I'll make lots of money. - Let me tell you, Grandson, money is not the most important thing in life. The most important thing is broads. Broads! Don't you ever forget it. - If you die, Grandfather, there will be nobody to take care of me. - Go America. - America? - Yes. - Long time ago, when I was a merchant marine. In New York, I met the most beautiful lady in the world. I fell in love with her. When you find her, she'll take care of you. - How can I find her? - Here. Take this. It'll help you. I don't know if she's still there. If you find her, tell her I loved her. Yes, I'll... Grandfather? Bruce, I like some more sauce, huh? - Boss, why do you keep calling me Bruce? I'm Joon. Bruce was the champ. - I don't care, champ or no champ, I'm callin' you Bruce, and when I call you Bruce, you are Bruce, you understand? Besides, you all look alike anyway. It's true! - Can he really do that karate stuff real good? - Bruce? Nah, he can't even chop a liver. Oh, God. - Mm, hey Bruce, the sauce is wonderful. What's your secret, huh? - Dog meat. It's a joke. But seriously, folks, I make the best spaghetti in the world, with a special flour from mainland China. You see, 5,000 years ago, Chinese invented the noodle. And Marco Polo came to China, and took it back to Italy, and it becomes spaghetti. And I can even sing Italian song. Oh yeah? - Rico, how are you, my friend. - Bon journo, Capo, you're looking well. - I feel good. - Come, join me in this feast. - No, excuse me. I promised the wife, Nicola, dinner at home tonight. - Rico, you brought me somethin'? - You're gonna like this. It's pure. - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Uh... Dammit, what's the next line? - And the right to seek council. - Oh yeah, thanks. You have the right to an attorney. In the event you cannot afford one, uh, I'm available. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. Hare, hare. - Many pardon. But we are lost. Where's Disney Land? - Do we look like Mickey Mouse? - Ah, so. Ah, Mickey Mouse. - Hey, get out of here. Hare Krishna. Hare, Hare. Hare Krishna. Hare, hare. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. - Care for a flower, sir. - Hey, we carry our own flower. You just pray for us. - I can't stand this anymore. - I'm taking off this one too. - Me too! You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. - He's out cold. You better give him mouth to mouth and make this bust legal. - Thanks, I needed that. - We're losin' the men to these federal agent busts. We need the solutions now. - We can bribe the FBI. - We'll give them our brand of cigars. Dynamite. Let's infest in bulletproof Gucci loafers. - Hey, I got an original idea. Let's just make them an offer that they can't refuse. Offer our mother-in-laws, eh? - Boss, enough. What do you mean the boss to think that this is? Monkey business? - Maybe there's a leak in the system. You can't trust anybody, can ya, Pete. - You the one to know about the leaks. You got a big mouth. And don't forget, Big Al, I'm the one in power here. - Maybe that's our problem. - You push too far. That's a call from New York. Hello. - Ciao, Lil Pete. Ciao, boss, it's nice of you to call. - Do you have your men with ya? - Oh, yes, boss, they're all here. Everybody's here. Put me on conference. - Si. - You boys have embarrassed me. Opportunities blown. It's hard to believe. You guys being defeated by a bunch of kung fu clowns. The next time you're on the job, you think about your family. One more mistake, they'll be widows and orphans. I'm going to make sashimi out of you. This is the last fish that I'm going to eat. The next meal will be you. Kapish? - Yes, Boss, don't worry. Grazie, ciao. Ciao, Lil Pete. Goodbye, boys. - We gotta do something. Pretty soon, we're gonna have the feds fightin' in our own back yard. Oh my God, it's a raid! - Don't shoot! Hey, guys, it's me, Freddy! - What the hell is he doin'? - Makin' lunch. - Hi, boss. I'm makin' spaghetti for you. You know the difference between Italian food and Chinese food? - No, what? - $5 per person. - Ah Fung? I went school with him. His brother name Ah Chu. - Ah Maron? I don't know him. - Help. Help! - Hey! Break up. Lady, give that man his purse back. - It's my purse, he's the thief. - What you doin' around here, man? And where you from and what you want? - With my right foot, I can knock out that knife. With my left I can kick your nose. With this hand, I can poke out your eyes. With this, I can break your neck. Take a good look at my face. I'm an oriental. - It's cool, bro. I don't want to trouble this time, it's cool. But next time, it's gon' be me and you. - I don't wanna see your face in this area again. Arrivederci. - How many time I got to tell you, arrivederci, she means goodbye, huh? - Sometimes I don't know if I'm coming or going. - What do you got in the box? - Oh, some noodles for Genele. Maria! Maria. For Genele, huh. Say, you look a little pale, how 'bout a beer, huh? - Hey, baby. Hey, check it out. Woo. - Hi. - Hello. Oh, you look so beautiful. Are you from New York. - No, but I am drinking a Manhattan. Is that close enough to New York for ya? - No, I gotta go there. You see, my grandfather had a dying wish. - And, what was that? - To stay alive. He said I must go to New York, find this woman. My grandfather loved her. She's gonna take care of me if she's still there. - My name's Anita, what's yours? - They call me Bruce. - You mean, like Bruce Lee. - Yeah, who else? - Then you must know kung fu. - Oh yeah, I once stepped in it. - Hey. If you're lookin' for Mister Right, I'm right here. - How 'bout some Tequila, Sheila? - To tell you the truth, I'm glad that you're here to protect me. Those guys scare me. - I can take those guys out with one bare hand. Stick with me, I’ll teach you self defense. - Okay. - Hey, egg roll. We heard what you said. - With my right foot, I can knock out your face. With my left, I can kick your nose. With this, I can poke your eyes out. With this I can break your neck. Take a good look at my face. I'm an oriental. - I challenge you, sucker. - I gotta go to john. Mexican beer. I'll be back. I'll be back, you guys. Be prepared, you guys. - Open the door, you creep. - Rape, rape! Leave me alone! - Come on, buddy, let's go! - I'm coming right out, you guys! Be prepared, you guys. Bruce.

Alright, everybody stretch. Stretch. Stretch to your right. Stretch to your left. Twist. Stretch. Come in. You must have the right spirit to guide you. Inner peace. Control. Patience. It's all mental. - My grandfather was a mental patient. My father was a mental patient. And now it's my turn. - Let me stress inner peace. Control. And tranquility. Excuse me. Hello, Dojo Studio. What the hell you talking about you son of a bitch? I'll sue you for every yen you have, you stupid damn! As I was saying. You have to have control. With control comes concentration. You see the wall? You can make a hole through the wall if you have concentration. Try it, you can do it. - I'm not gonna try it. You try it. - I'm not gonna try it, I'm the master. - Let's get Mikey, he'll try anything. Class, do you think he can do it? You see? They don't think you can do it. And I don't think you can do it, either. You asked for it. What's going on? What is this? - Well, hi Master, you're a little early today. Oh God, come on, what is it? - Mikey, Mikey, come here for a second. Hey, what's going on in here? What is this, get out of here, I'm gonna call the cops. - It's all in the kya. When you kya, you must bring all energy from your body into one focused point. Kya! Now, you try it. Hmm. - Kya! - You? - No, Memorex. - Get out of my place. You are hopeless. - I must learn to be mental. - You are mental. - But I'm paying you to teach me. - I'll refund your money. Change your clothes and get out! - Whoa, you're very good. Let me see. It's natural for me. I do that all the time when I make a noodle. See, oh, look at this. Oh, Master. Oh, I know how to do this. - No, no! - My vase, you broke it! I will kill you. - Master, you're out of control. You sucker mother! Now what? - I wanna return your sticks. - Keep them. Go home and practice in your closet. - Are these eggs fresh? - Hey, this is a stick up, man! Hands up. You, hurry up with the money. Come on.

I'm tellin' ya, this guy is Bruce Lee reincarnated. - You even look like Bruce Lee. - Well, with the proper training and diet. - Can you strike that karate pose for the cameras with the sticks over your head, please. Get that, Sherry. - A Bruce Lee lookalike put on a dazzling show of kung fu. An eyewitness said that the gunman never had a chance against the martial arts hero. - Ciao boss. I got the good news. No, I got the great news. You don't have to worry about any more trouble. I got a guy who's gonna fix everything from now on. I got a new delivery man. They call him Bruce, master of kung fu. - Here comes the guy in the paper. This ain't like the real Bruce Lee. - Hey, man, I don't care what the papers say. You're still Brucey. What are you lookin' at, Brucey. You're nothin' but jive, man. I can kick your ass any day of the week. - Kick my ass any day. Well, I'm busy all week. - Yeah, you're a phony, man. You don't even know kung fu. Get back. What do you say to this, fool? - If you must fight, fight dirty. Kick him in the groin. Hit him with a rock. Bite off his nose. But, most of all, use your brain. Not fists. - Oh, you're fantastic. Who taught you that? - Master Cho. - Oh, we're acquaintances. I study under Master Cho too. Do you know the martial art code? It says pupil study under same master must never fight. - Yeah? For real, huh? - Yeah. And that's too bad, I can't beat you up. What code? - Well, maybe he's right. Let's forget about it. - Yeah, I don't study for Master Cho. I study for Master Tung. - Oh, that's great. Then you two can fight. And I personally think that Master Cho is 10 times better than Master Tung. - My master's better than Master Cho. - Hey, wait a minute, my master's better then yours. What are you talkin' about, Master Tung is a pussy. - Yeah, yeah! Hit him in the stomach. Hit him in the balls. Hit him in the nose. - Hey, look. He's got nun chucks in his pocket. - Let's go check him out. - Hey. You got a permit to carry those nun chucks? - This?

That Big Al thinks he's gonna be boss of the West Coast? That sneaky bastard will never get my job. Never! - Listen, boss, nobody can tear down a reputation like yours. You're a good boy, Freddy. You've always been a loyal, trusted servant of la familia. When you get back from this job, I'm gonna promote you. You're gonna be my consigliere. - Really? Like Robert Duvall? - You gonna sit in Big Al's seat at the other end of the table. - I hope I don't have to sit on his lap. - Sit on his lap? You make a joke?- Yeah. People say I got no sense of humor. Sit on his lap. You make me laugh! Hurry up, I don't wanna miss Hollywood Squares. - Oh boy, Florence Henderson. - Florence Henderson. Remember, no tell Bruce about anything. Alright?- Yeah. Make sure this place is locked up, because this stuff is worth millions of dollars now. Yes, sir. - That's it, huh? - Put the barbells down, I gotta talk to you. - Look at you. You've been eating too much pasta. Take that tie off and get down here and work out with me. - Carmen, put those goddamn things down. I got the plan set up. - I hope this plan is better than the last one. If you wanna be boss in the West Coast, killing Pete's dog isn't gonna do it. - You know that poison was meant for Little Pete. How was I supposed to know the dog likes cigars. - So, what's your plan this time, Rover. - You know I love you just before you get slapped. Had enough? You really know how to hurt a guy. Thanks, darling. - Bad news from Africa. Your brothers and sisters are being killed for their ivory. - Shut up and listen to me. If I'm boss on this coast, you'll be right there alongside me. You'd like that power, wouldn't you? Why'd you have to kick me? You didn't have to kick me. - Oh, I'm sorry, poor baby. - Look, the Boss of Bosses is going to exterminate Little Pete if one more job gets busted. I know Little Pete's plan. They're settin' up Bruce as a delivery stooge. You follow Bruce, switch the coke whenever you can before they get to New York, okay? Little Pete will be river moss, and I'll be boss of the West Coast. - You mean we will be boss on the West Coast. - That's what I said. - Bruce. You're a hero, I saw you in the papers. You're very brave. Where'd you get your black belt. - Oh, I got my black belt in the Orient. It was easy. Only written test. - Do you have a girlfriend? - I'm a sex object. Every time I ask girls sex, they object. - Well, could I be your girlfriend? Listen, I'll give you this necklace. Here. Let's go steady. Okay? Now, as long as you wear this, I'm not gonna make love to another man. - Me neither. Bruce, I got a new job for you. A new job? - I'm givin' you a raise. From now on, you get the minimum wage. - What do I gotta do, boss. - Listen and I tell you. Your spaghetti recipe, it's famous.

More money and going to New York? - You got to learn about America. This is one great country. - When do I start? - What, you got ants in your pants? When I say so. - How long does it take to fly to New York? - Wait a minute, not so fast. First, you gotta stop at different cities. If you don't deliver the flour to all of my friends, you never get to New York. Understand? - I finally get to go to New York. - Freddy, he's gonna chauffeur you. - Freddy? My chauffeur? Why don't we want to fly? - Fly? When you fly, you see nothing. But when you drive, you get to know this beautiful country. Start packing. Bruce, where you get that necklace? I never seen that on you before. - Oh, this? It was a gift from my new girlfriend. - Ah. When you get back from your trip, maybe you get married, eh? - Oh, I love get married. But I hate to give up my girlfriend. - Bruce, tell us about your girl. - Oh, she's beautiful. Sexy legs. Really big eyes. - Yeah, yeah? Did you touch any? - Easy, animal. She hugged me.- Yeah? And she was moaning. - Yeah, yeah? She tore my shirt off. And scratched my back. - Yeah? Kissing my eye. Kissing my nose.- Yeah! Breathing in my ear. So, was she good? I'm not sure. I don't kiss and tell. - This is serious. Now, Bruce could lead us to the head of this drug ring, and you guys know it. Now, we've got to do whatever it takes to get him to New York. - Breathing in my ear? - Bruce. Be sure to deliver all of the flour and never let it out of your sight. Otherwise, you never get to New York. Freddy, he's gonna keep an eye on you. Right, Freddy? - There's right, we're not gonna let you down, boss. - Oh, I wanna capture this moment. Say kim cheese. - No, no, no. No pictures. Just remember to never let the flour out of your sight. Eh? Alright, your first step is Las Vegas, so enjoy yourself. But, don't gamble unless Freddy shows you how to do it, huh? - I never gambled before. I can't even say blackjack. Goodbye, so long. - Ciao, ciao. Freddy, remember, drive carefully on the road.

And we have leather whips. I love the whips part. The name's Toby! The name's Toby! No, no, Kunta Kinte, Your name's Toby! That's for Suzy Chapstick. And that's for meat by-products.

And that's for heehaw! You're name's Toby. Yes, yes, my name is Toby. Help me! Of course there's always castration. Of course, if you want some more conventional method. This gun and silencer is just dandy. - I hope everything is prepared for the arrival of my guest. Look, I want you to make him feel at home. He's a very important visitor. Go all out. Well, Bruce, we're in Chicago. One more delivery, and we're on our way to New York. My grandfather told me he had a friend in Chicago. Al Capone. Never heard of him. - Bruce has arrived, sir. - Tell him to come in. - Howdy, folks. - Welcome. - What is this? - Give me a hug! - Oh, sure. Welcome. Oh, of course.

I as a samurai warrior, but I gave it up. You were a samurai warrior? Why did you quit? - Union problems. - You say you're a samurai warrior, but the fly is still alive. - But that fly will never make love again. - After dinner, I'll give you a massage. Would you like that? - Massage? I like massage. In fact, my first time in America, I worked at massage parlor. They fired me. - What for? - Rubbing people the wrong way. - Ah, that's good. Harder.

Yes. - Thank you. Don't you recognize me? We met in Ginelli's bar. - Oh. She's the lady who gave me this necklace. - Oh, yeah, you're the one with all the moanin' and the kissin' and the breathin' in his ear, huh? - Look, I'm a federal agent. - Oh my God. - The necklace I gave you was an electronic microphone. We've monitored all your conversations. We know your locations all over the country. - Oh my God. - Can't you say anything but oh my God? - They used you, Bruce. You were their stooge. You weren't delivering flour, you were delivering cocaine. Drugs, Bruce. - Drugs. Oh my Buddha. I've been delivering drugs. Oh, forgive me. - Bruce, I was gonna tell ya. But, you know, I took an oath. - Don't blame Freddy. If he'd said anything, they would've killed him and you. - I took an oath too. For Bruce Lee. Now I have disgraced him. - Not yet. You can still make up for everything. We'll get an amnesty for Freddy. I need your help. - Now you want me to be your stooge? - If we can catch these guys, we can stop the entire distribution of all the drugs in the underworld. When we do that, we can find your lady. But, I need your help, Bruce. - I must help you. That's all there is to say. - Here we go. - Well, well, Freddy. Now, I'm glad to see that you’ve decided to make up for your unhealthy mistake. Where is it? - If we give it to you know, you'll kill us. - Freddy. You're already a dead man. - Well, Bruce. I guess you'd better give it to him. - You see? You're braver than I thought. Hey, where is it? Kya! Hey, Bruce, the enemy went that way! Hold it, freeze! - Move it, on the car, on the car! - Hello, Boss. I hope you like the food in hoosegow Otherwise I'll have to bring Chinese noodles for you.
