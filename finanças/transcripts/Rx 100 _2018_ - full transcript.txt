[Door creaking] [Grunts and mones] [Glass shattering] [Groans] [Pot clanking] I was waiting for you for three years. Noq I have got hold of you. [Grunts and groans] Uh... Aah! [Grunts and groans] Uh... uh... uh. [Groans] [Grunts and groans] [Groans] [Metalic sound] [Grunts and groans] [Man screaming in pain] [Man screaming, bone cracking] [Scream] -Hello, sir. -Hello. -Hello, sir. -Hello. [People greeting] [Baby crying] -Hello, sir. -Hello. Uh... This is the room. Oh, no. Don't get up. Hm... You are badly hurt. Looks like they beat you badly. When did you return from village? Last... last night. -Last night? -Yes, sir. You returned last night And he found out in the morning! It seems he is thinking a lot about my men. Don't worry. I will give you some money. -Take rest. Get well and come home. -Okay, sir. Hm. [Sirens hooting] Another thing. In this situation going to police would not help at all. Leave that to me. I will talk to the SI. He will handle it. Take rest. Ok? Okay, sir. Let's leave [Typewriter clicks] -Take him. Handcuff him. -Ok, sir. What is this, Shiva? Why do you fight with the villagers? The SI sir is coming. Sit properly. Shiva, sit properly. Sir. Is this how you sit in the police station? Who are you staring at? Lower your eyes. Lower your head too! Tell me. Why did you hit him? I had lost my mind. What did you say? Say again! Are we cowards that you will hit whoever you want? When you'll be thrashed you'd know what police is! [Jeep coming to a halt] Hey, inspector! Stop! Move your hand. Move your hand. Why have you brough my son? Because your son beats up whoever he wants to. If I don't bring him to the police station, what else do I do? Did you see him hitting anyone? Do you have any proof? You have the complaint, don't you? Show the FIR. Someone says something and believing him you brought him to the police station. This won't do. Shiva, come on. Hey, daddy. He may escape today. But the day I get hold of him, -you too won't be able to save him. -Hey! Get lost. [Jeep engine sound] [Cow mooing] I told you so many times, can't you understand? What was the need to beat Kali? Do you realise what you are doing? Why are you disgracing yourself in the village? What you are doing is scaring me a lot, son. Listen to me carefully, son. Tell me, daddy. Leave this village and go. Apart from it won't ask anything from you again. Go away. I am willing to anything else aprt from it. I will do whatever you say. I have still not got the girl I loved. I will not go from here.

And daddy is supporting him too. They are complaining to the MRO and the Collector. Let them do it. That MRO is our man. Shiva had thrashed that MRO too. We will have to do something about him, Kashi. If a cat really gets angry it can attack like a tiger. If we take on each other in a hurry, a third person can take its advantage. So whatever we have to do, we have to do it together. We will wait for the right time. For how long? He didn't even spare Vishwanath. Last night he burned his grains sacks kept in the farm. [Water splashing] [Sizzling] [Jeep screeching to a halt] Vishwanath, how did this happen? Daddy, do not pretend. I know you are making him do all this. What am I making him do? Don't talk crazily. If anything happens in the village is it on my say so? You can say tell me anything. But don't say anything about my son. You are supporting him a lot these days. If you start a fire, we won't come every time to douse it. Someday we will also burn you in that fire. Yes. I know. You will burn and I would just watch, is it? -Laxman. -Yes, daddy. -Let's go. -Yes. Hm. Though the sacs aren't burnt properly but Vishwanath is really burnt, daddy. -Is Shiva really involved in it? -No doubt at all. Only Hanuman had the guts to burn Lanka. And only Shiva can dare to burn Vishwanath’s sacks, daddy. Whatever nonsense you are talking -don't say it in front of anyone else. -Okay. [Jeep starting] -Ticket. -How many?

[Laughter] Daddy, he is envious that I am getting married. -Why will I be envious? -You are. -I want that you should marry. -Is is? You think you will be quite happy after marriage. You will be doomed, dude. What are you thinking? What he is talking? Daddy, you don't know his story. Don't be crazy about marriage. You foolish fellow. You are taking a decision in haste. You will suffer day and night. This 10 minutes' of pleasure, it will steal your day and night's solace. All your life you will be in anguish. Honestly, my son. The burden of responsibilities will cause you hair fall. Your face will swell and become like a dog. You will wander on the streets. You will be called a vagabond dog. And one day you will be seen scuttling like a bull. And one day you will be hiding your face and roaming. [Laughing] -Then all of us will say... -What? It's Pappu's marriage. It's my friend's marriage. [Drumming] A grand marriage... -Daddy. -Yeah. I won't stay here, daddy. If I stay here, they will make a mockery of my marriage, daddy. -I am leaving. -Wait. -I am leaving. -Wait, son. -Come on, sit. -I don't want to sit. -I am leaving. I am leaving. -Wait. Where are you going? -Let's talk about your marriage. -I am leaving. [Laughing] Hey! My dear boy! It's been long time since I saw you so happy, I am solely responsible for your condition. I couldn't bring you up the way I wanted to. So I will have to apologize to your parents. Hey, Shiva Do you recall your parents? They were like Sita and Ram. They were such good people, Do you know? If someone was hungry, they would give him their food. Whatever I am today, it's because of them. They loved me like a family. And such great people, before my eyes, in an accident they breathed their last in my arms. Wntire village had cried. The entire village. And you were so small then. But you didn't cry. You came smiling and hugged me. And I decided that you are my life. You are everything for me. But today, when I see you like that.. Huh. I don't remember who my parents were. I don't even remember how they looked. You are everything to me, daddy. Just you. When you are there, I have no grief. I love you, daddy. I love you. -My son. -Hm. Will you do me a favor? Yes, sure, daddy. I will do anything for you. So listen to me. Leave the village and go. Uh, uh.. I won't go, daddy. If you ask for my life, I will give. But don't ask me to leave the village. Why won't leave? Why not? Will you be like this? I have told you so many times. Don't you understand? Do whatever you wish. -Hey, Laxman. -Yes, daddy. Let's go. Hey! Do I have to tell you separately? [Birds chirping] Caw, caw, caw] Papa. Come, dear. Come on. Come. [Laughing] Dear, was your journey good? Hm. Why are you saying filmy motherly dialogues? Has she come by horse carriage or bullock-cart that she'd have problem? -Come, dear. -Come in, dear. -Hello. -Yes. Hello. Sir, we have come to discuss about that land. You go freshen up. -I'll get breakfast ready. -Ok. Hmm. Hi, granny! Forget all that. What kind of dress you're wearing? You may wear any kind of dress outside. but when you were coming here, you could have worn decent clothes. As it is, it's your age to depart. Yet you have a problem with my clothes. Whether I pass away of not, what's to you? Do what you are told. Are you waiting for me to die? Better I had died, before seeing this. If you want to die, why delay? Why later? I will send you off right now. Go and die. [Hiss of spray] Aah-uh. Uh... I have brought this for you. If you spray this and sleep at night, you will have very good dreams. Did you hear her? I don't like her lifestyle at all. Listen to me. I will do whatever I like. And if I want, I will take the off too. Shut your mouth and just watch. What? Huh! -Listen, bring my hanky. -Yee, I'm bringing. Vishwanath, you educteds your daughter in a hostel. -I don't know about that but she's too arogant. -Oh God! Mother, she has come here for a few days let her be happy. Because of you she has stopped coming home. -Sir, everyone is waiting. Come. -Yeah. Here. Your handkerchief. -Listen. -Hmm? Let her be. -It's counting time. I am leaving. -Okay. Wonder when they will jell! Huh! What's it, daddy? Are you afraid that you will lose? Your leader is personally supervising the vote count. The winner is always one step ahead, Kashi. Laxman, regardless of what anyone says, victory is ours. Turn Gandhi's face this way. Hm. Damn you! Uh... ah... Daddy. Um. -Hmm! -Yes, boss. [Grunting] Shiva. If you even touch Gandhi's statue, it won't be good. Hmm. Can't you hear what I am saying? Huh! No need to raise your hand. Talk and resolve the matter. To hell with talks. [Punches] I will teach you a lesson now. Thrash him! I won't spare you! -What are you talking? -How dare you! -How dare you raise your hands! Tell me. [Crowd shouting] Hey! We have won! Yeah! [Celebrating] [Whistling] Female announcer: 'Vishwanath has defeated Kashinath with 25000 votes.' 'Heartiest congratulations to him.' [Celebrating] [Whistling] Yeah! [Laughing] They always win with devious means. I won't spare anyone. Huh! [People shouting, celebrating] -Hey, Kali. -Sir. Did I win or him? Did I spend the money or him? Should I be congratulated or him? I should have been happy but what's happening here? We will talk. Hm. [People shouting] Whatever is within, we will have to discuss all that. Yes. Yeah! [Drums beating] [Drums beating] [Whooping with delight] Hey, you've made us win! [Laughing] Hold on. Hold on. Victory might be new to you. It's old thing to me. Everybody go home. Hm. Yeah. Okay. [People shouting and celbrating] [Celebrations continue] [Crackers bursting] [Drums beating] [Whooping with delight] [Laughing] [Whistiling] Did you see, Vishwanath. Nobody will be able to compete. [Laughs] Now we will. Now we will do it. We will fulfill all the promises we made to our people. If any Kashi interferes, he will also see what we can do. Yes, we will do it. -Hey, Shiva. -Yes. -How is your theater doing? -Great. What's it to you? Daddy is supporting you. It has to be great. Daddy is not an ordinary man. To win the election, Kashi had resorted to all kinds of tactics. If anybody else was there would he have won the election? The girl is just like you. Is it matter of joke? If she had been like me, her complexion would be like me. But she taken after her mother. -Have it. Please have it. -Yes. Yes. What is your daughter's educational qualification? She has studied engineering. So you'd need a groom like her too. Of course, we're looking for a groom. -Let us find a good alliance. -Yes. That's true. -Shiva. -Yes, daddy. Go and see whether food is ready. -It's time. -Yes. I will see. Uh... Aunt, listen. What happened, Shiva? I am asked to cheek if the lunch is ready. I have sent everything outside. Oh God! If you're in kitchen you don't know what's going on outside. Shiva. -Fritters are hot. Have them and go. -Yes. Fine. -Oh, uh... Sorry. -Hey! I'm Sorry. Why did you touch me? -You should have seen. -Uh... Sorry. I didn't see. That's what I am saying. You should see. As such, do you know where you touched me? Uh... Well... Hey! No need to show me. You touched me deliberately, didn't you? I am speaking the truth. I didn't see. It was inadvertent. You must have touched me deliberately. I shall show you! [Crowd clamouring] Hey, why are you jumping the line. [Crowd shouting] Bro, how is the collection? Superb. It's a great film. If the collection continues like this, we will be able to start such a theater in our village too. Fine. Give the collection's account to daddy. Yes, bro. [Festive music] -Oh, oh! Hey, listen. -Yes, ma'am? -Go and bring coconut and sweets. -Yes. [Festive music] [Louhg drum beats] [Loud shout] [Thud] [Shrieking] [Grunts and shouts] -Oh Lord! -Papa. -Are you all right? -Go get him. Get up. [Growling] I don't know who were they who had come to kill my son. Hmm... What's this? Keep quiet! Your wailing is giving me a headache. He couldn't tolerate defeat. So he sent goons to kill you. It's Kashi's doing. He is not angry because he lost. It is because we didn't give him his share. Share of what? Shiva, did you find them? Daddy, they ran away. But surely they were Kashi's men. -Come let's end the game. -Wait, daddy. Don't get angry needlessly. I know to deal with such people. You get many opportunities to defeat your enemy in life. But the opportunity to kill the enemy you rarely get. What have you done? Just thratened and come back? I had not expected daddy and Shiva to be there. We should finish them off first. They will have to think thousand times to kill me. But we don't need to think even once. I want them dead. The share I should have received in the sand business I did not get that. Which will always pinch me. It's good I didn't win the elections this time Right now that Vishwanath must be trembling with fear. Now he will come and apologize to me and do compromise. Wht's it, grandma, you called me? You have come, Shiva. I have grown old. Nobody cares for me. Nobody takes me to the temple either. That's why I have called you here. No problem, grandma. Let's go. I will take you. Wait for two minutes. I will get ready and come. Okay? Parvati, is the veneration tray ready? [Phone ringing] Hello. 'Hello, Shiva.' Yes, brother? I have taken Mahesh Babu's movie for distribution next. Oh, great. I have called to book the theater. No need to say that. 100 days in our theater is confirmed. If there is any minor work, get it done. Okay? -Nothing should be lacking. -Yes. I will get it done, sir. Get it done nicely. Yes, brother. Uh, uh, yeah... [Laughing] Yes, why not? Uh... -Come, let's go, son. -Uh, yes, yes. Come. Come. Yes, son. -How is business doing? -Yes. It's doing great. Please sit. Yes, son. I will sit. I am old now. My limbs ache. Aah... -Where are you off to now? -To the temple. You just said you won't come. But now, I am coming, arn't I? Sit at the rear cquietly. Hm. Uh.. Hm. Can you drive? Hey! Uh... She just looks like a girl, but her habits are like boys. Since childhood she's this way. You sit, son. Oh God! Oh, oh, uh.. I would die. Her driving is rough. Uh, uh.. Drive slowly! I want to go to the temple. Don't send me to heaven now. Uh, uh, ooh! Uh, uh... Son, I am afraid. Oh God! I survived. I too survived. -Shiva. -Yes. -Help me get down. -Yes, grandma. -Come. Get down carefully. -Oh God! Come. Come. Easy. -Carefully. -Uh... Yes. Huh. -Will you alight or not? -I don't want to come. You go. I've to go other temple. Haughty girl. You have nothing to do with temple. You simply wanted excuse to go out. Huh! I have many other things to do. Tell me where to drop you I will drop you. Hey! Sit! Come on. Sit. Hey! Why are you so serious? You had touched me. Shall I take that seriously too? Tell me. [Engine firing] [Engine revving, gear shift clik] Hey! Do you think I am achauffeur, that you're riding like a stranger. What else do I do? Oh! Will you do whatever I say? Hello. Who will change the gears? Put the gear in third. Horn. Don't touch. [Honking] That's enough. Hi, Shiva. Hey, Sapna. Hi. Who was she? Girlfriend? No. Just an acquaintance. Acquaintance. Seriously? Uh..ah..uh. Hey, what do you mean by that? -Don't you know? -No. If you don't know, it's good. Hm. [Temple bell ringing] [Bell ringing] Seems, you have wished sincerely. What have you wished for? Hello. I said what did you ask for? You don't share what you wished from God. Oh! What did you ask that you can't share? Daddy, this week our theater's collection should be -better than last week. -Yes. -We are releasing great movie, daddy. -Yes. Yes. [Laughs] [Laughing] [Jeep engine purring] What is this? -They are standing there with a tractor. -I don't know. [Jeep engine roaring] Why you guys standing like that? We had come to take sand, daddy. They are asking money from us. Why are they asking money? This is our village's river. Everyone here has a right on the sand. Who asked for money? Come, let's see. How dare you collect money for our village's sand? Hey.... Aren't you Kashi's man? What are you doing here? Don't ask me. Vishwanath asked me to collect. Go and ask him Vishwanath? -What nonsense is this? -Yes. Of course. He said, whoever it is unless he pays, he cannot take sand. Is this sand you father's or his, that you are asking money? Come on. Let's talk to Vishwanath. Hey! You come too. Bring him. Move. Leave my hand. -I do whatever you say. -Yes. -Only we can help him. -Yes. What's it, Vishwanath? Is it your order to charge for the sand? We will discuss this later. -Yes, what we have thought... -This is not right. It's wrong to extract money from people. Everybody has a right over this sand. Stop extorting money. Who are you to tell me? Hmm? You come with few people and ask me to stop, will I stop? How much I spent on election do you know? Do you know how much I paid to each of your men? -Did I ask you to do that? -I have to. I have won because I distributed money. Do you think I won because of people's vote? If I do what you are saying, I will have to beg on the streets. Huh. You doing all this for money, aren't you? Or have you joined hands with Kashi out of fear? -Stop your nonsense. -Hey! If you want money, I will give it to you. We didn't make you win so that you join hands with wrong people and do illegal deeds. -What nonsense! -Vishwanath. Hey, do you know who you're talking to? Men: [Shouting] How dare you raise your hands on daddy! [Table falling] [People shouting] [Groans and grunts] Man: How dare you! Go away! -How can you talk like this! Man: Don't let him go. [Door banging] Hey! You! Oh... oh... Uh! Hmm. Get aside. Hey! Stop! Do you have this ability too? Yeah? -I didn't know it. -Leave me. Hey! -Listen what I say. -What? Uh... do you know, I've been waiting to tell you something very important? I like you. Too much. How to tell you this, I had no idea. You just say yes, we will start romancing here itself.

Can't you live without the phone? Indu, you see, I cannot live without you even for a minute. When you are not with me, I will see this photo. [Laughing] Fine. -It's quite late now. Let's go. -Wait for a while. We are meeting tomorrow, aren't we? Now let's go from here. Come on. [Smiling] Daddy, when did you come? What is the matter? These days you are quite busy. You don't even think about your daddy. It's nothing like that, daddy. Shiva, everybody gets a chance in life to fall in love. But the chance to live happily in love throughout life, very few people get. They are fortunate ones. You are at that stage now. Enjoy it. On an opportune day I will speak to Vishwanath. -I am going out. -Okay, daddy. [Phone ringing] [Phone ringing] Yes, Indu. Tell me. Shiva, everybody has gone out of house at this time. Everybody will return late. -Come here fast. -Right now? What else? Come on fast. Come on. Yes. Fine.

I won't let that situation arise, Indu. Then? What will you do? Fine. Let's do this. Let's get married right now. Is that okay with you? Hey! Where are you going? Shiva, where are you going?

Where? [Bike engine revving] [Footfalls] Daddy, that... -Why didn't you inform me? -Uh... uh. I told him not to tell you. How did this happen, daddy? To talk about you I was going to Vishwanth's home On the way I met with an accident. It means, you didn't go. I wonder what transpired there. And how Indu is. She isn't even receiving my call, daddy. Nothing will happen. Don't worry. Don't be afraid. On mention of your name Vishwanath will call you home to a grand welcome. It will take some time. You'll have to have patience. Okay? Krishnarao must be at the farm. He will give you some money. Go and get it. Hey! I am telling you. Go and bring money. Hm. Go and keep it there. Yes, keep it on that side. -You've been harvest since morning... -Yes, sir. -We are doing it. -It's not even a truckload. Hurry up. I have to send the truck. -Mr. Krishna Rao. -Okay, sir. Hurry up.

Man, why are you beating me? Indu got married. Everybody has gone to Hyderabad to send her off to America. I think Indu must have reached America by now. [Gasping] [Click of lighter] [Auto entgine knocking] Hey, stop, stop, sop. Here. Hah? Yeah. Nothing has changed. The same stones and the same filth. The same ugly faces. Bloody villagers. Yes. How much? -Whatever you wish, sir. -Hey! Can't you speak? How much it is? Tell me. -You won't be able to pay that much. -What did you say? I can't pay the auto fare! Do you know how much my house, farm and bank balance is? Tell me. -It's 50 bucks. -What, 50 bucks! For such a short distance fare is fifty bucks! Here, take 10 bucks. Wonder whose face I saw early morning... -Get lost. ...that I met this sample piece. -Mr. Kothari, when did you come? -What? How are you? Nothing. I was missing the village and you a lot. -So I came back. -Yes. You haven't changed a bit. If I haven't changed, you won't offer me tea? There he goes again. Give him a cup of tea. Have you forgotten manners? You should offer water before tea. Your drama hasn't lessened. What? Tap water! I don't drink anything less than mineral water. You know, yesterday I had been to senior sir. Servant served ordinary water, so Mr. Govinda sacked him. -Mr. Govinda? -Yes. -Why you went to his house? -He had invited me. He was after me to fix an alliance for his son. -What! -WhatI tell you, man? -His son doesn't like any girl. -Oh! He has put all the responsibility on me. -That's a great thing. -Kothari. I have a daughter. She is in BA second year. We are looking for a groom for her. -Please talk to Govinda. -Is it? Bring her photo and come to my house this evening. They want an alliance quickly. -I will make the connection. -Oh God! He hasn't stopped bluffing. He'll have to be stopped somehow. -Bro, I want to talk to you. -Yes. Tell me. Ambani's PA is calling me and driving me crazy. Is that so? -The gas pipe which is installed, -Yeah. -He is saying it's leaking. -Yeah. I don't know where the leakage is, but he's calling and driving me mad. Now what will you say? Um-hm. Now I understand. He has been calling me since three days. Who? Who else? Mukki Ambani. Oh God! I am not picking his calls. That's why his PA with his sources has found out your and my village. And he is after me. -Listen. Promise me. -Yes, here you go. -If he ever calls you. -Yes. No need to tell him anything. Don't ever say that we belong to the same village. -No,no, no... -How much can I handle now. -You are right. -I don't even have breathing time. Order two 'Samosas'. Give him two 'Samosas'. -Isn't there anything else to eat? -First eat this, bro. -He will bring more. -Yes. -When will I get tea? -Eat this then the tea. You have said, so it will come. Only to eat... Uh... Yes. -Hello, daddy. -How are you, Kothari? -Have you just come? -Yes, I just came. Hm. -How is your business going? -What do I tell you, daddy? It's been just a day I have come to the village and he has made hundred calls. Without me his company doesn't run. Have you thought something about Shiva? He doesn't understand no matter how much you explain to him. You have to explain as one's mind works. Then it registers. You love him. If you tell him, he won't understand. Don't worry. This time I will take him with me. Do anything, but take him away from here. -Sure I will, daddy. -Yes. -Hey! What are you doing here? -Sir, he... Get in the car. Come on. I escaped from him. -I will leave now. -Okay, daddy.

[Startled gasp] [Vessels clanking] Huh! What rubbish are you babbling in front of my house! Huh? Don't you know? Your daughter has loved me. What rubbish! -What nonsense is it? -Hey! Don't yell! When you found out, you got her married and sent her away. And you are saying as if you don't know anything. Hmm... Indu is mine! And she will always be mine. That's why she has come here. Indu! Come out, Indu! Your papa and the entire village doesn’t know how much you love me. Come and tell everyone so that they know. -Hey, Indu! -Why you guys are watching? Throw him out. Out! -Come on. -Hey! I have no enmity with you people. If anyone touches me, I will chop him off. Why? Are you threatening? No. I am just not threatening. If time comes, I will kill too. Hey, the girl who is married what melodrama you're creating at her place? -[Slap] -Hey! Indu, I have waited three years for you because I love you. Now nobody can separate us. Untill you come, I won't leaver here. Huh! Uh... [Mobile ringing] Hello, Mahesh. Indu! Since the time you have gone, I'm sharing my sorrows with it. This is the only proof of our love. [Siren hooting] [Tyre screeching] See. Hey, stand up. I said stand up! Hey! Hey! Get hold of him! Grab him! [Scuffle] Take him away. -Carry him. -Come on. Move. Huh! I will show you at the police station what am I. -Don't ever look at my home! -Move... -Indu, don't be afraid of anyone. -Take him away. -I will come to take you. -Get in. -Get in. -Get in the jeep. [Jeep starting] [Door closing] [Siren hooting] -Hey! -Sir. He was talking about evidence. -Burn the bike. -Yes, sir. [Door creeking open] [Gurgle] [Banging on door] Hmm. -Ramji. -Yes, sir. -Bring a cup of tea. -Okay, sir. [Footsteps] Where is Shiva? Eh, Daddy? What's it, you have come so late? Weren't you in the village? [Laughs] I was waiting that you'd come. But when you didn't come, I welcomed him in my style. Shiva. Nobody has lodged a complian. And FIR is also not registered. Didn't I tell you, the day I get hold of you, you won't be able to do anything. If you're een near that house again, you can't imagine, what I can do. Hm. Let's go. [Footsteps] [Door creaking] [Grunts] Uh! [Rooster's crow] [Motorbike vrooming] [Footsteps] Shiva. Shiva! [Footsteps] Shiva. Shiva? Shiva! Where is he? [Door banging open] [Heavy breathing] [Sobs] It's been three years since you left me. How I have suffered these three years I can't even tell you. [Heavy drag] I waited like crazy. I knew you'd certainly return one day. I... Here I was in so much agony. And I know, you too must have benn in agony for me. Remembering you, not the tears, I used to shed tears of blood. But I didn't share my grief with anyone. I am speaking so much and why are you silent? Say something, you have returned to the village after so many years. Speak up. Uh, uh... I... Behind your house... I roamed like crazy. But I didn't find you. After all, why? I am talking like crazy. Why are you still quiet? -Today I am in front of you. -[Muffled shriek] [Muffled shriek] Today you will have to tell me. When you didn't want to maintain this relationship, why did you make me chase you? You too loved me a lot, didn't you? Tell me! Oh! Is it because you're someone else's wife now? [Muffled cries] Just because you're married to someone else so I should let you go, my love is not such. [Muffled cries] [Sobbing] Hey, Indu. Why are you afraid? I am your Shiva. [Muffled cries] And you had said you loved me. I am your Shiva. [Muffled cries] Fine. Come. Let's go from here. If anyone comes between us, I won't spare him. Today our fate will be decided. [Muffled cries] Indu. Uh... Carefully, Indu. -Indu. -Shiva. Shiva. Shiva, leave me. -Come on, Indu. -Listen to me. [Slap] Listen to me. Have you lost it? What are you doing? It's true. We were in love. And had dreamed too. But nothing came true, Shiva. Uh... hhh. If you had really loved me, you would have been happy, in my happiness, Shiva. Got that? But you are actting like a crazy. By doing all this, you are disgracing my family and nothing else. And along with it, you are also hell-bent on ruining my life, Shiva. It's a lie. You don't love me at all. What nonsense! I don't love you? It's fear of your father, isn't it? -No, Shiva. -Let's go. -Shiva. -Let's go. -I say you come. -Leave me. I am not afraid of your father. Let's go. -Leave me. -Uh... Shiva, leave me. -Indu, come. -Indu. I say, let's go form here. -Leave me. You need not be afraid today. -Let off my hand. -Just come with me. Indu, come. -Let go off my hand. -Come on, Indu. Nobody can stop us. Hey! Hey! Hey! -Leave her. -Papa. Leave. Leave her. I am telling you. Leave her hand. Leave her hand. -Do you understand or not? -Get lost! Papa. What are you doing? -Get up. -Shiva. -Leave me. -Come, Indu. -Shiva, what are you doing? -Leave my hand. Let go her hand. I said leave. Damn you! [Slap] Leave her hand. Hey! Hey! -Hey! Take him away. -Yes, daddy. Come on. What drama are you both crating? Huh? Vent your anger on me. You come home and harras woman folk? You are trying to ruin my daughter's life. I beg your pardon, Vishwanath. Whatever happened today, it won't happen again. Whatever happend here, it wont's happen again, how can you say? Whatever I have to do, I know it well Get lost. Go! What are you doing? Get in the jeep. I am telling you. Come on, sit. Sit in the jeep. He has gone made after the girl. [Engine firing] [Jeep engine idling] What do you want after all? Hmm? What do you want to do? Step down. Get down. Why don't you answer? I cannot live without Indu, daddy. Though I was far form her for so long, yet I couldn't bear it. And if I find out that she can never be mine, how will I live? Hey, she's married, she is someone's wife now. They forced her to marry. Whatever it is, a marriage is a marriage. She is married. Forget her now. I have loved her. It's not a joke. that I will forget her so easily. And you fall in love just once in life. Like the waves of the ocean that never stops. Have you gone insane? Nowadays guys change girls within weeks. And why are you torturing a married girl in the name of love? She doesn't even like to see you. Why are you trying to go to her house repeatedly? Phew! What kind of man are you! I tried but you don't understand. You don't understand me. In three years not a day passed when I didn't miss her. My love is true so she is back here. Shut up. Repeating the same thing. If you ever stepped in that house, you won't find your daddy. What are you saying? Are you trying to scare me? Think whatever you want. You won't go to that house, that's it. I will go. She is afraid to come with me. I will extricate her fear. I will tell everyone that she has returned just for me. Phew! [Slap] I don't understand how to explain you. You have gone mad. I supported you till now. That's where I went wrong. Along with you, now I too have to endure all this. Tomorrow itself we will leave this village for good. I won't come. If at all, I will come with Indu. How will you not come? I know how to take you away. Come. Daddy. Daddy. [Door banging open] Ugh [Door banging shut] Daddy, you only think about the girl. Think about him too. What's to think? If she loved him then why was she so sacared? Why did she marry someone else? If she was scared why did she love? Who loved? And whose fear? Do you think she loved him? Or she's afraid of her father? Actually, she was never in love with him. What? She only used him for her physical pleasures. What are you saying? Yes. That day Shiva told me on the phone that Indu is going to talk about their marriage so I should also go there. Same day I met with an accident. And I lied that I was going to Vishwanath's place. But the my accident wasn't while going there. Instead it was while returning. I had lied. I don't feel like leaving you. [Dishes clanking] Papa, I want to talk to you something important. Papa, I have something important to discuss. What's it? I like a guy. Indu, you even know what you are saying? [Scream] You go inside. Papa, why did you become so serious? Why are you venting my anger on mother? Speak. I love someone. And he too likes me. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about this. But in so many days I didn't get a chance to talk. His name is Mahesh. What? He was my classmate. His family is settled in US. His plan is... we will get married and settle down in the US. His parents are in Vijayawada now. That's why I am telling you everything now. You might find the best alliance for me but you won't find a better alliance than this, papa. What? What are you saying? I said whatever I had to. Now whether you agree or not. If I marry that will be Mahesh. Why are you quiet? Say something, papa. Call him. Phone and call him here right now. I will get you engaged tomorrow. I will get you married in 10 days and send you off. Really, papa? Ah, uh... ah... ah. Love you, papa. I was too tansed as to how will I make you relent. I will call Mahesh right now and ask them to come over. [Laughing] Hey! Can't you stay away from your phone? Shiva! Shiva, come back. [Laughing] Indu! -Indu... -[Laughing] [Crying] [Door banging open] Shiva... Why are you hear now? -Throw him out of here! -Throw him out! Why are you hitting me? [Sobbing] -Indu... -Get lost! Indu... Indu! [Sobbing] Hey... Leave me! I want Indu, daddy. Daddy, she also loves me a lot. 'I love someone.' His name is Mahesh. [Tyre screeching] Her dishonest eyes. Her talks are lies. Her love is fake. Actually she's a wrong person! Had Shiva come to know this, something might have happened, he might go and harm her, that is why I got scared. I thought, in a month or two... or in a year he will forget her. What else? He didn't forget her. Finally, I was willing, didn't I? Despite all this why did you leave it? You should have talked to Indu. You crazy. The girl who has no remorse, what would I have talked that girl? After getting discharged from the hospital I found. that girl is engaged. I couldn't even see her in the village. I searched a lot and finally I went to her house to ask her. You are doing the wrong, dear. He is very innocent. He loves you a lot. I tried my best to explain to papa but he is not relenting. Stop your acting. I know everything. I heard your conversation last night. Oh! So you heard. Making him fall in love with you, you are marrying someone else now? Not just Shiva, but also your parents and yourself too you are deceiving but nothing. Hello. What is this? I am listening quietly, so you will say anything to me? You're calling me a betrayrer? Are you done? Your son just went out with me for a few days, he took it seriously. Now if he has fellen in love, then what can I do about it? -He took your each word as true. -Huh. He is lost in dreams of love. And he doesn't even realise. You have kept him illusionary world of dreams. You can consider it love or deceit. I don't know nothing. It was fine till going out with him, but I can't think of marrying him. So I took an option. Option? Oh, oh. -You need a man to go out with. -Huh. And for the marriage, a soft man, right? Yes, so? What will you do? You are talking as if some girl's life is ruined. You said it so easily. When he told me, he loves Indu, I thought you are a decent girl. I never imagined you will play so nasty. Now that you know, go and tell him. Till now you have just seen his love. not his fury. If he finds out the truth, he won't let you live. By falling in love with you he did make a mistake. But, now I won't allow him to do this second mistake of killing you. Don't waste your time by blackmailing me emotionally. I don't care. What is the need to blackmail you? Wait and watch. He will forget you. And I will get him married to a girl better than you. Do whatever you like. Till his daughter’s marriage, he kept Shiva in his rice mill and got him beaten at the very place. I shall hack each of them, I had decided that. But if I had done anything, her life would have been ruined. So let it go, thinking I will end this game here itself. You told him to leave the village. I thought you are telling him in anger. But I didn't know you are carrying a burden in your heart. Fine. Let's go. [Footsteps] [Footsteps] [Cow mooing] -What's the matter? -Uh... Are you tensed? Um... Why will I be tensed? He has been torturing you for two days, but he's torturing me for three years. Huh... I am quite tenseed because of him. He has tortured me so much that I feel like shooting him. He beat up my men. Set fire to my warehouse, Came home and quarreled. Dragged out of house... The matter came to such a pass. Why don't you do something to him? Everybody keeps asking me. They don't know. That my daughter is responsible for what he has become now. Entire fault is of my daughter. What is my fault? -What did I do? -Shut up! Don't feign ignorance. I know everything. There can't be a father who will call her daughter bad. I too am like that. If I do something to him, I wonder what video or photo he has that he might paste on some wall, thinking of it I'm doing nothing. Your husband is coming in two days. If he finds out about all this, I wonder what will happen. Don't think anything about Mahesh. I will manage him. Keep your mouth shut! Shameless girl. You will manage! What will you do? You have roamed all over the village with Shiva and you married Mahesh, will you tell him this? Your kind of girl needs... a man outside the home, one outside village, one on the street, one in mother's village, one in father's house and one to marry. Among all these men, there is just one, who loves sincerely. We were unfortunate that we got this. If you are asked why you did this, you would say you did it for fun. Was this for fun? For your fun and frolics, you punished him? Uh... You make small mistakes that snowballs into grave mistake. and it haunts your parents forever. Enough. If you knew it, than why did you agree when I talked of marrying Mahesh? For my honor. Think in place of a father. Who will be better in two of them, thinking of it, I got you married to Mahesh. Selfishness, dear. My should have a good life, that was my selfishness. After all I was a father. Now something has to be done. All right, I will tackle him. You have to help me, Kashi. I thought, why to resort to violence if talks can do the trick. But now it's not so. The matter reached such a pass that he'll have to be killed My son-in-law is coming in two days. If the situation remains the same when he comes, I am afraid for my daughter's future. Now stopping Shiva is not my cup of tea, Kashi. What do I do? That's why I have called you here. If I help you, what will I get? You... I will make you win the next election. I will also hand you over this sand mining business. To stop whatever has happened to you till today, there is just one way. What? -Let's kill him. -What? You will kill him? I said it earlier too, but you guys didn't listen to me. Now you've brought him to home. Now at least listen to me. Hm... Killing will not be right. What will you do... I don't know.

[Thunder] She used you and dumped you. [Thunder] Oh, uh... You think her father got her married? Hey... uh... [Thunder] Actually, she got married to someone she liked. No. No...

If this is what you wanted, you should have told me. Why did you inact such a drama? You played with my life in the name of love. Why did you do that? -[Shrieks] Tell me. You had told me... "If you are about to die, then it should be one minute before you." -You are my life, Indu. -[Crying] You're my life. That's why I have come here to fulfill that wish of yours! -Huh, huh. -No...

[Screaming in pain] Go, I have given you... -you life in alms. -[Cries in pain] [Crying in pain] With this thought… thinking that you.. you will suffer all your life. This is your punishment. This is your punishment, Indu. Go. I give you your life in alms. In alms! [Crying in pain] I thought god doesn’t exist. But there is God. Before dying... I found out your truth.
