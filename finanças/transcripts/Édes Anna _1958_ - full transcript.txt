WRlTTEN BY P. BACS? AND Z. F?BRl FROM A NOVEL OF D. KOSZTOL?NYl MUSlC BY:. DlRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY:. STARRlNG:. DlRECTED BY:. G?bor!. They fell. How do you know? Isp?ndy was here. You know, that ministerial secretary. He said they're clearing off. - May I take it? - Yes. They say there will be international occupation. English, French, ltalian. Will you go to the Ministry if this will calm down? Nuts! One has to wait, old pal. Now we can even take it standing on one leg. Bye, G?bor! Tomorrow I'll come again if I can. - Where are you going, comradee? - Home. I live over here. Then hurry up. Close the windows and the shutters. Yes, comradee. Councillor! How do you do? - What's new? - Hello! Good afternoon! They fell. It's over. Heard about B?la Kun? - Flew to Moscow? - Flew? They made him fly. My dear councillor, they made him fly. The Allies'ultimatum kicked him in the punts. One of my girlfriends told me this morning that one of her friends saw him flying over the V?rmez? with heavy golden chains hanging on his arm while waving with a sneer. They say he dropped a church-cup from the airplane when he... Good afternoon, comradee Ficsor. Katica, come quick! Katica! How many times have I to shut for you? Go into the bedroom close the shutters. Katica! The Red have fallen. The rascals! Wait, wait! I'll go. It's me, sir, it's only me. Is that you, comrade Ficsor? Yes. I came because of the bell. Because of the little bell. I know it's no good. I have a little free time, I'd fix it for you, sir. Well, they fell. They fell, the rascals! Yes, sir. On the top of the castle the three-coloured flag is waving. My brother-in-law put it there. It'll begin soon! It'll begin very soon. Katica! Give the ladder to comradee Ficsor. The battery is in the kitchen. I know, sir, I know. - I'll be going, sir. - Where to? Lajos came back with the barge. He's moving on tomorrow. But walking on the street is forbidden now. There is martial law. At 6 o'clock everything is closed. Nothing will happen to me. Bye! Where are you going? I'm going down. I've something to do. Are you fool? They're shooting outside. I'll avoid them. Bye. What do you think? Today, yesterday and the day before? When will you come back? At midnight again? Or at dawn perhaps? Never, if you wish. Did you hear it? The dirt! The slump! She's going out again... Don't be nervous, darling, let her. Lajos came back with the barge and... Yesterday her cousin was here, tomorrow her brother will come. And I don't know who'll come the day after. She's a paid enemy. Don't worry darling. Where have you been for such a long time? I was worried about you. I ran my legs off. For this. - What is it? - Butter. For three handkerchiefs. - Who's there? - Ficsor. What's he doing here? He's fixing the bell. Is he doing it after all? We begged him for four months and he never had time. That Red should be kicked out. Quiet! He may hear you. And then? He's a Red, isn't he? He himself boasted about it. The dirty Bolshevik! Just wait! Don't! Not yet, one can't be sure yet. Weakling! I wish you a good day, madam. Listen, Ficsor! - If you think that after all that happened... - My dear madam! Don't interrupt me! The communist world is over. There is a girl, my dear madam. What kind of girl? A good one. A maid. - From Budapest? - Oh, no! From the Balaton, a village girl. Is she reliable? I respond for her. She's a relative of mine. But I won't leave, godfather. I like to be here. I'm well here. And Mrs Bartos likes me. What would she do without me? Her husband was blinded at the front in 191 7. Now she has to work. Who would take care of Bandi. Come here, Bandi! Who'll come to my house? I'll! He wouldn't let me. He promised to marry me. - Is it true, Bandi? - It is. Who would tell you tales about the clasp knife and the birds that fly out of it, Singing birds with white wings. - Is it true, Bandi? - It is. You have to come, Anna. The house belongs to them. He's a ministerial councillor. If you refuse to come, I'll get in trouble. I just can't go, godfather. Don't be angry with me, but I'm not going. The trade-unionist government abdicated. A bourgeois government will take over the power. The communists will be arrested. Listen, Ficsor, you're just talking. What's with the maid? She'll come, madam. This won't do, Ficsor. How long will you feed me with empty promises? - Will she come or not? - She will, my dear madam. - What's with that servant, Ficsor? - She promised to come. If she promised, she have to come and do her duty.. I'll have the police bring her. You can tell her that. - ?des? - That's her name. Anna ?des. Yes... I hope she'll do everything that is to be done. Clear rooms, do the cooking, washing, go to the marketplace, fetch coal from the cellar. And when all is ready, she mends stockings, clothes and so on. Of course. She's not choosy. Are you, Anna? That's good. I don't need ladies. Work is required here. Now the question is, whether you'd like this place? Can't you speak, my child? I asked whether you'd like this place. How? I'm not accustomed to such answers. If you don't like it here, take your book and good bye. You can go away. She didn't mean that, madam. You didn't, Anna, did you? What did you mean? Do you want to stay? I do. Then speak lucidly, since you're among fine people. If you behave properly, you'll get on well here. - Where's your bag? - Downstairs. - Go and get it! - Yes, madam. Have you a lover? No use denying, I'll find out anyhow. - No acquaintances? - No. You must know someone. The Ficsors and the Bartos family, my ex-masters. Nobody else? Nobody. That's better. They'd only spoil you. What's your father? A servant. How do you mean servant? Hand labourer. So he's a farmer. And has he anything? House, land or swine? Nothing. And your mother? She's dead. I've a stepmother. Here it is, madam. - Bring it to me. - Yes, madam. What's this? I got it from little Bandi. Who is little Bandi? The Bartos's son, where I worked before. You can bind it. Ficsor, you can leave. Yes, madam. I'm your humble servant, madam. God in Heaven, good and wise, I'm now closing my eyes. Let my prayer flly to you, guard over me the whole night trough. T ake care of my parents, Lord, all of my benefactors, Let us greet the rising sun, in good health and harmed by none. Anna, Anna, the clap-knifle with the birds. I didn't florget it, Anna. Look! Anna! Anna! Anna! Where were you loafing? We won't be good friends. Anna! Really must I care for everything? The milk will boil over. Anna! I hope you don't use a brush. No, madam. Because it mustn't be done here. Anna! Where have you put my sedative? Anna! Go on eating but after put out the light. Anna! What kind of cleaning is this? The top of the wardrobe in the bedroom is full of dust. Stop playing with that owl! Aunt Ang?la! - Jancsi! - I kiss your hand, Aunt Ang?la. I thought you weren't coming at all. - Aunt Ang?la! - Jancsi! Stop it, Jancsi! Let me see you. Heavens, you became quite a man! Well, what's new at Eger? News? The Bolsheviks have eaten up mother's bottled fruits. And father gave up smoking. - That's all. - Oh, my dear boy! My God, the coffee is boiling. Sir... Do you know that your uncle Korn?l has flound a job flor you in the bank? I have to work, Aunt Ang?la. You must present yourselfl tomorrow. You know, I thought you had missed the train. They checked everyone before Hatvan. We spent three hours there. I hope nothing happened to you. What are you doing? My heart aches, Aunt Ang?la. Beacause of the excitement. They took me for a Lenin-boy. They made me stand before a wall with 3 armed men in front of me. - Oh, my God! - Then I drew forth my gun... ...raised it and fired. Don't be angry, Aunt Ang?la. It turned out too well. Anna! Stop this stupid giggling. Hurry up and fetch the young master's bags. Are you crazy? Before the maid? I'm sorry Aunt Ang?la. I'm really sorry. I didn't see her. - When will you sober down at last? - Never. Never, Aunt Ang?la. Anna, Anna! Come back! - Give it to the count. - To which count? The one driving the coach. - Is he a count? - Of course. Of course, he became a coachman during the Commune and he's used to it. Stop pushing! Everybody will get in. The next please! - I'm ready Mr B?thory, good bye! - Good bye, dear Anna! - Did you make this too? - Yes. The last time you gave me a piece of cake, it was really good. Because I put butter into it. That's why. I wanted to ask you something a long time ago. Ask then! Have you ever seen me not like this? - Properly dressed, in civilian clothes. - I did once but it was so strange. I didn't recognize you, because you had a hat on. We laughed at it with Stefi. Other people wear hats too. Yes, of course but... But you, Mr B?thory, I never saw you like that. That's why. My dear Anna. Would you come to my place sometimes? Why? I'd show you my flat. And the little Erzsi, my daughter. She's twelve years old. But recently she's always loafing. - I can't manage her. - When did your wife die? It will be two years this autumn. In atrophy. She needs someone. We need a woman. Well... You'll find one. You're not too old, and you earn well. I was offered a widow from Erzs?bet. - She's got a small house. - You see? But I don't like her. If it would have been you... Don't be silly, Mr B?thory! I'm serious. I thought about it a lot. Anna! Stop your chatting! Hurry up, you have to go to Dr Moviszter to get a receipt. Your mistress is a terrible woman. The doctor is always laughing at her. He says she has only one problem. But he can't cure that. Still she has brains enough to count the sugar cubes. She's stingy, isn't she? How can you get on with her? Me? Well. You're a damned fool. You became famous in our district. You're the ideal maid. Is the doctor's wife playing the piano? Yes. From morning till evening, always the same thing. She isn't normal either. Here's the receipt, my dear. Two tablets, three times a day, but your mistress knows it. You seem to be anaemic. Visit me one of these days. Anna! Anna, where are you? Run, before she pulls your ears. Thank you, good bye. Good morning, young man. Good morning. Good morning. Sir! Are you leaving like this? In slippers? What are you grinning at? Care about yourself. Your breasts and legs. Why aren't you nude? Well, go on! And tell me, doesn't she steal? Don't you know Anna? Don't you know this miracle? No, I haven't had the pleasure yet. I haven't been introduced yet. What a lovely woman! You'll see her now. She doesn't go to the movies or theatre, she has no lover, no family. She is sitting at home all day. She doesn't even go out on Sundays. Of course, one must be firm, but... Put it down, my child. Well, this is Anna. My Anna. But next time don't come in these shoes. Go out, my child. Good afternoon, Anna! Good afternoon, young man. Anna! I'm sorry for yelling at you in the morning. Well, he's crazy about you. - Who? - Mr B?thory. - Ah! - He says he'd worship you if you married him. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment. She'll get along fine as long as she's her own master. Don't listen to her. She'd run on all fours if he'd ask her. You mustn't miss that chance, Anna! He's an independent contractor. You'll marry him, won't you? I don't know. Anna, you're not listening. What a fool you are! What a chance! Pour out the coffee, please. I'm in a hurry. Etel, kill that chicken while I take the coffee in. What kind of a village girl you are? You can't even do this? I can't do it. My mother scoled me for it too. Mikl?s can give evidence how much Etel can eat. That's incredible but last week she ate two plates of pastry. She can swallow a big quantity of food. Our Stefi isn't at loss either for a little appetite. My Anna eats less than a bird. What do you think she eats for supper? You can't guess. Nothing. She doesn't even touch fine dishes. She doesn't like them. Maybe she likes them too much. Don't you understand, Mikl?s? She told it herself. That's why. Do you give her the same food you eat? I bet you don't. How could she defend herself? She makes herself believe that these things aren't good anyhow. Give her good things to eat, you'll see how she likes them. You've gone crazy. That's what their peasant stomach needs. Nonsense! My dear Mikl?s, you are red in secret. And how cleverly he disguised it! An old fox. Cheers, old Bolshevik. Leave me alone, I don't drink. I don't believe in equality, my dear doctor. This doesn't exist. Maids are maids. Their stomachs are different, their souls are different. May l? Thank you? Won't you have some sugar? Thanks. - Play something for us, darling. - Oh, really! That lovely song... You know. - Yes. - With pleasure. - Thank you. Thank you, Anna. Anna, please! Give me a plate. Here you are. This is yours. No, thank you. Why? You don't like it? No thanks, I don't like it. Well, put it on the dresser. I don1t want to press you. - I say! - Lovely! Catch it, Anna! My God, she's afraid of a chicken. Stefi! Catch it now! At last! Six chemises, three petticoats. Three nightgowns. A red shawl. All brand new. And the flat, of course. Not much but still something. Well... Well, yes. Still something. Well, my dear Anna? Give me time to think, Mr B?thory. You used to cook for yourself? Sometimes one of my neighbours comes to help me. And sometimes I brew something for myself. And doesn't it make you ill? Erzsi is here. Where have you been again? Why are you so muddy? Can't you say hello? Good evening. Hello. Take off your shoes, they are quite wet. I'll do it if I want to. Of course. But I'm sure you do, for your feet are cold. - Aren't they? - And isn't your throat cold? You open your mouth too often. Listen, you'll get a box on the ear. I saw potatoes under the kitchen table. I could prepare some goulash. Where is the red pepper? The red pepper? In the kitchen. It used to be here but I can't find it now. It was never there, it used to be here. Thank you, Erzsi. I need a sharp knife too. Thank you. This evening I have a little time. My masters will be in Eger for three days, for the vintage. The young master comes home late. He only eats something cold. I want to have electricity led in. It's expensive but worth while. It has different glow. Well, it has. Once upon a time there was a little boy. He was such a wonder, that while dreaming, a white almond three grew out of his eyes. With the nest of a golden bird, that knew the little boy's thoughts. - Are you sleeping? - I'm not. Who is playing the piano? The doctor's wife. - Are you afraid? - No. - What's this? - The chicken. Off with you! Anna! You're so beautiful. Don't young master! I swear, you're so beautiful. - Young master... - I love you. Say you love me too. Leave me alone, please. Go play with the ladies. Young master... You are really in love? Don't be angry with me. I didn't wanted to offend you. - Are you here, Anna? - I'm here. Are they sleeping already? Yes, they are. As hot as you can endure. Only then will it have an effect. Yes. Here is the medicine. They say this will help. - You must take it all. - Must I swallow it? Yes. You unwrap, dissolve the powder and drink it. You'll be all right by morning. Be careful! Nobody should find out. This is forbidden. If they found out, we'd both be jailed. - Sir. - Yes? I'm sorry but I won't take them. Are you fool? It would be such a lovely baby. A love-child is always so beautiful. Out of question, Anna. You must do it. I... I'd get in great trouble. And don't be afraid. It's nothing. It's nothing. Sir! - You aren't angry with me, are you? - Of course I'm not. But be careful. Good night. Anna! I love you... Anna! I love you. Anna! Anna! I love you! I don't need ladies. You have to work here. Washing, cooking, cleaning, waxing, scrubbing. Mending stocking and clothes. Work is required here. Washing, cooking, cleaning... I love you. Say you love me. I love you. Now you'll eat this all. If you don't I'll force it into you. Anna! Anna! Anna! What's the matter, Anna? Anna! The shutters... Open the shutters... Oh, my God! What's wrong with her? I didn't know what to do. She seamed blind and deaf. - Maybe the Spanish flu. - The doctor wasn't at home. I'll call him down. No use. I wanted too, but she refused. She's quite all right now. It's fantastic how much these peasant girls can endure. - Can I clean the table? - Yes. Do you feel better, my child? Yes. Tomorrow you'll have the day off, Anna. You need a bit of fresh air. I don't understand why you never go out on your free days. I have nowhere to go. But I'll go to the Bartos family, I haven't seen Bandi for a long time. All right. By the way you can take the young master's luggage to his new flat. - Has he moved? - Yes. 3, Sz?nyeg street. Tomorrow I'll explain you how to get there. Now you can clean the table. Good night. Good night. Please, madam... Get a new maid for the first, because I'm getting married. To whom? To Mr B?thory, the sweep. Good bye. She's a good girl, but she can't be florced. And you have no means to prevent her flrom going. Anyhow I'm fled up with this servant aflflair. Let her get married. Look flor another girl and that's all. - Stop shouting! - You stop shouting! You think no other girl can do what she can? No other girl can do what she can. I won't start this torture again. Go down to Ficsor immediately and talk to him. What the devil shall I tell him? He should force her to stay. He's her guardian, or heaven knows what. Tell that damned communist, if he doesn't settle this, I won't keep quiet, I'll report him. I don't care, he can die, he can be hanged, I don't care what happens to him. You're murderer. You killed me. You're out ofl your mind... So you're getting married? You're getting married? Do you need a dowry? And what will happen to us, my dear lady? I vouched for you. Did you forget it? I can be kicked out. I can perish. Because the lady wants to make love with the chimneysweep. What do you think who you are? You filthy nobody. You louse! You have time to get married. Maybe you'll find a better suitor. Your godfather wants to do good. He said all this for your interest. Go back and apologize to madam. And if I hear something again, I'll break your head with a hatchet. Have you brought them, Anna? Yes, Sir. Leave it to me. Are you all right? You see? I told it to you. But... It was so bitter! My God, how bitter it was. Bitter? All the medicines are bitter. But finally that's over. Thank you, Anna. Wait! This is for you too. Are you still angry with me? Not at all. Well, good bye. Isonzo was a trifle. Piave, was something. That was really something. Calm down, you're at home now. Piave, yes! The water was red. Corpses strewed about like puffed rats. Yes... That was something. A whistling candy. Don't you remember me, Bandi? Don't you remember Anna? She used to sing to you. You even gave her your golden trumpet. Don't you remember? You wanted to marry her. Who told you tales about the clasp-knife with the birds? A lots of white birds fly out of it when it's opened. Don't you remember? He talked about you and the knife for a long time. We had to hide all the clasp-knifes from him. He opened all of them and we didn't know what to tell him. He was looking for the birds. Mother, it doesn't whistle anymore. It melted. Never mind, my dear. Well, good bye, little Bandi. - Good bye! - Good luck, Anna! - Good bye, Anna! Look, Anna, Mr B?thory. - Is this the widow from Erzs?bet? - She is. They'll have a baby by summer. Oh, Anna, what a fool you are! Congratulations, madam. Congratulations. - You meant to say the cabinet? - Exactly. And from tomorrow you're the wife of a state secretary. I beg your pardon but this is a procession. That's great! Did you hear that, Anna? She fell asleep. And then? And then we creep on, nude as we were, until we arrived to a house. But in the house there was only the young daughter of the teacher. What did she say? Don't push me! Oh, my dear God! Anna! Anna! Anna, pull yourself together. What happened to you? What is this? Nothing at all. She had a bad dream. That's all. Tell me, Anna, is it true that the secretary will give a great party next week? Yes, my mistress said that even the minister will be there. Yes. Hurry up, Anna! Is the plate with the meat ready? Just a minute. Three toasts are already over. Now the minister is speaking. He's a funny man, at least when he's drinking. Bring the potatoes! Good evening, Anna! Hold it for a moment. At least this evening you could have been punctual. - Uncle Korn?l is very angry. - Don't be angry Aunt Ang?la! For the dearest aunt. But in case you're angry, this is real. And I'll shout myself. - Sir... - What are you doing here, Anna? You were told to stay in the kitchen. The whole flat will stink with your oignon smell. Come in, you rascal. I grew up in the country, but I've never seen eat people like they do. As if they had been starving since the war. Why don't you eat? I'll eat later. Don't economize for them. They came out to the sitting-room. - And what are they doing? - Talking. - About what? - As usual. About maids. They can't talk about anything else. And that madam is worried. They need a new flat. A bigger one. Representative. That's what she said. She'll need new servants. Valet and cook. Your masters are getting rather snobbish. You see, Anna? How fool you were to miss that B?thory? I tried to persuade you! God, I did. How nicely Jancsi and the lawyer's wife are dancing together! I hope it won't bring a baby. Etel, Stefi! Bring in the refreshments and the champagne. They're cooling in the bath. Anna, stay inside. I told you once already. Jancsi! - Take care, they'll see us. - I love you. Say you love me. I love you. Anna! What's going on, Anna? The guests left a long time ago. May I ask you to prepare the bed? You'll clean the table tomorrow. Heavens... How tired I am. And I won't be able to sleep. Come on, Anna! They did have a good time. Of course. If they endured till three o'clock. His Excellency was very kind. They are lovely people, aren't they? Oh yes, but his wife is a nobody. But my Godness! Her father went round in the country selling mugs. For heaven's shake, Anna! It's simply impossible! How clumsy you are! Be off! I'll do it myself. Put out the lights in the saloon. Anna, for heaven's shake! You'll clean the table tomorrow. Anna! Are you deaf, you idiot? Be off! Open up! What on earth can be wrong? Half past one. They can't be sleeping yet. They can't. Step back, please. Believe me. I'm saying that the door must be broken in. Their phone doesn't answer. A locksmith! Where's the locksmith? I'm coming! Let me have a little room. In the name of the law everybody remains outside. You two come in as witnesses. The others should stay outside. Well, the girl is here. Why didn't you open? Are you deaf? Was it you? You'll be hanged. With this? Why did you do it? Go on! I asked why did you do it? - l... - Were you angry with them? You must have had some reason. They treated her heartlessly. Inhumanly. They treated her brutally. If you don't mind, doctor, what role did you play in the Commune? Me? I'm a Christian and a humanist. And that what I was during the Commune. I always hated the provocateurs and the worms like you. Mikl?s! Please, my husband is a doctor and he's ill. Please, leave him alone. What's happening here? Nothing. Nothing. Are you crazy? You're talking until you find yourself in prison. You idiot. Is this your bed? Is this your bundle? Yes. Please, note it. One worn cotton dress. Some old handkerchiefs. A pair of shabby man's shoes. An iron comb. A mirror and a copper toy trumpet. A bag... a bag of chestnuts. Roast chestnuts. A hundred crown bank note in the bag. That's all. Put the handcuffs on her. Is this true that they found a golden chain she stole from her masters. I don't know but a diadem with gems was found in her bundle. It belonged to some countess. - Nonsense! - They didn't even give her the salary. How do you know? What are you to her that you defend her? Me? Nothing to do with her, just... - Her godfather. - Don't deny it. I've nothing to do with her. Nothing. They're coming! I can't understand it. Such a good servant... Such a honest girl... I never did like her. There was something evil in her eyes. She had a sneaky look. - She served them for almost a year. - Yes. A year. In August it will be one year that she came here. - Just after the commune. - Terrible. One never knows whom one lives with. - Bye, dear, we'll meet again in the afternoon. - Of course, good bye, dear.
