I'm Kim Gwang-su of the national swimming team. Sorry to call you out of the blue. But it's so unfair! Coach hit me so much, I ran from the training center. Yes, the national team coach. He said to be hit 100 times with a rod. After 17 hits, I snatched it away and ran out. Well... I came a bit late to training without notice. A week. I wasn't sick. Just for personal reasons. I was ready for the Asian Games. It's so unfair. Can you write an article? How can he hit someone like that? 16 YEARS LATER Ready! BOYS FREESTYLE 200 METER FINALS Busy again? At the pool of course. He placed fourth again. What do we do now? Let him swim as a hobby. Stop saying that! What hobby! You kidding me? Bye! Rock, scissors, paper! Why me! Hey! Junho! You stupid? How can you eat? Fourth place! You're killing me! What will you become? Think of your future! Wanna become a loser? You hate me, right? Right? Think of me chasing you as you swim! It'll help you swim faster! Got that? Well, I'm trying my best. Man! So frustrating! Up! Junho! Faster! Kick! Kick! He placed fourth again! I can't take it anymore! Damn... It's so damn frustrating! What happened? He placed fourth again! What if he's cursed to be fourth? - Just buy him a treat. - What? Mom! Mom! Give me a dollar, please? - You're smiling? - No. You feel like ice cream? Hello, ma'am. Ah, hello. I called you earlier. I'm Junho's mom. - Oh, right. - Hello. The church is so bright and nice. It's a new building. You're way prettier in person. Oh, please. You're a legend among swimmers' moms. Oh, please. That's nonsense. - My son swims too. - I see. It hasn't been long. Just 2 years or so. So his record isn't the best. You should pray a lot. Right. But I heard you know of a coach who can train to get medals. How can you ask me so bluntly? Shouldn't you try to find one on your own? Of course. Start by praying. What do you wanna be in the future. I want to be a swimmer. Oh really. And then? And... When I retire I gonna be one of the Olympic IOC committee members. Oh, nice~. - Thank you. - Bye. - Take care. - Move! - But I'm playing! - Move now! Junho! Go review. Just 1 hour, please? - No! Go study. - Please? - 1 hour? - Go! You too, Kiho! - Please? - Go study! 1 hour? What's with you boys! Hello? Mrs. Kim? Hi, Mrs. Lee. Want the herbal extract? With 10 people, we'll get 20% off. Really? Wait. Let me check. Hey! - Stop wearing my clothes. - 20% off? I am not! Then, I'll buy. Great. Thank you. Take care. Bye! Shoot! - Hey! - The sniper! - Go to your room! - Help me! Where's your shirt? Go study! Hurry! Hurry! Oh, man! ♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah! ♪ ♪ His truth is marching on ♪ Sister? ♪ In the beauty of the lilies ♪ ♪ Christ was born across the sea ♪ ♪ With a glory in his bosom ♪ ♪ that transfigures you and me ♪ ♪ As He died to make men holy ♪ ♪ let us live to make men free ♪ ♪ His truth is marching on ♪ ♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah! ♪ You got your wish. There is a coach... But God may punish me for introducing him to you. Junho has to win medals. If he does, it'll feel like being saved! I'm worried your son will get hurt. You know I know that. His pains will go away with medals. Oh, Lord. Hi. Sit straight. How long did you swim? - Two years... - He just got started. So? How is it? - I like... - He loves it! If you like something... Why'd you want to swim? At first. - For fun. - What? For fun, sir. He loved swimming ever since he was young. Man. Entered competitions? Any big ones? Won any medals? I placed fourth. What? Fourth. All fourth place? Fourth? Fourth in all of them? He started late, but he's got talent. He just misses getting bronze. Fourth... Come here. - Pretty quick. - Yes. Put your arms up. Straight. Stand straight. Walk as fast as you can. Walk around. Don't drop it! I'm simple but reliable. He'll win medals. And go to a good college. I really hope so. So you can't say a word about how I train. No matter what. Okay. Listen up. Wanna train with me? I said, don't drop it! If parents are too involved, kids can't improve. Of course. Please don't come into the pool. What? Never come to the pool. But I should see how he's doing. You can't. It's your first lesson. Be good! I know. Listen carefully to the coach. - Answer him clearly, okay? - Okay. Say, 'Yes, sir', okay? Yes, ma'am. Hello? Coach? It's Junho. I'm here. Where are you? You came? - Out of my way! - Non-stop attacks... We got to know each other now. Do I start swimming tomorrow? Why ask about tomorrow already? Junho! Your hair! It's okay! I told you to dry it before coming out! What if you get sick and can't train? - I warned you, didn't I? - Okay, okay. Hello. I'm Kim Junho. I saw you swim in a competition. Really? How does it feel to place first? Great. What's great? This. See ya. This is where you train? Yup. How's the coach? Is he scary? I'm tired. Coach? Coach! When are we training? What? When will training start? There's a competition next month. Shouldn't I start training'? The hell are you saying? You didn't come to swim. You just came to get away from your mom's nagging. You came because mom made you. Who cares? Just stick around and go when it's time. I don't waste time paddling with babies. You never saw me swim. How do you know I suck? It's a lie that you were a famous swimmer, isn't it? You made it up, didn't you? How dare you! Damn! Why you little! You little twerp! Get up! Come here! Let go! Come on! At least see me swim! I'm the only one swimming? Hello, sir. Hi. Greet him. Hi. Go get ready. He's the kid? Yup. Good. Do what you can to make a living. I owe you a drink. Whatever, fool. What are you doing? Get started. - No stopwatch? - What? - A stopwatch to... - Why you! Your swimming style is good. Like they say... It's good form. Okay, then. Let's train at dawn starting tomorrow. Good. Bye. Sir? What? That boy, Junho... Did you know he always placed fourth? Really? In time, he'll shorten his record and win. Damn right! He'll win medals. Because I'll teach him right. Sign me up for dawn. I'll train him 1 on 1 before others come. 1 on 1? Hey! Put the basket there! Ready! Go! Put your bag down! Concentrate! Go! Go! Kick! Kick! Keep it up! Stretch! Kick up! Come out! Come out! Come out now! Come out! Stop fooling around! How many times do I have to tell you! How many times! Why you! Get back in there! Concentrate! What do you want? Two of each, please. Okay. Want a hot dog? Look. It's not like I hit you because I hate you. You weren't concentrating and doing what I said. Wanna hear a story? My dad was a penny pincher. Know howl got money off of him? When he'd go out to work on a chug boat... I'd wait, then dive in the sea after it. I'd swim like crazy after the boat. Dad! Give me some money! Money, please! When I swam after the boat... Dad got scared I'd drown and threw the money! I played games and bought snacks with it. Gotta be desperate. Desperate to win! Get it? Desperate down to the bones! The way I see it... You can make it. Got that? Eat up. Kiho? Done your homework? I'm doing it. You played games, didn't you! No! Go sit at your desk and study! Take your books! Don't make me mad. Go study. Bro... Get out. Junho... I said, get out! Get out, twerp! Mom! Junho's back is bruised! - And he hit me! - What? His back is bruised up. Go brush your teeth. - I have to study. - Damn! What? Are you... Run like hell! Run! Run! Run! Come up. Up higher! Come up! Up! Junho! You can do it! Concentrate! Arms! Push! Push! That's it! Arms! Stretch out! Faster! Kick harder! Higher! Right posture! Junho! You have to go. Hurry! Get moving! Go! Go! Go! Hey, kid! What are you doing? You crazy? Come out. Come out now! Get down. Get down! Get down now! I said, concentrate! Get down. Get down! Get down now! Don't wanna swim? Wanna run away? A true coach will knock sense into you. I learned that the hard way. Get down. Get down. Come here. Sit down. Give me the towel. You're still all wet. Listen. Know what I wish my coaches did for me? Relax! When others got hit after a competition... I sat in the office and ate treats. Since I won medals, no one hit me. If they only hit me even though I was good... if they trained me harder, I would've succeeded more. Look. If you did your best, would I say anything? No. Of course not. I hit you because you don't try hard! Am I wrong? No, sir. What did you pray for? For Junho to win a medal. And me? Huh? Well, for you... to study hard and get into a good college. And good health for dad. And you? Me? Me... Nothing. This is the Boys Freestyle 200 Meter Finals. Ready! Go Junho! That's it! You're first! Good! Junho! You can do it! Faster, Junho! Faster! Arms!

Crazy little twerp! Why didn't you do what I said! I told you to concentrate till the end! Yes! Awesome! I don't believe it! So awesome! - Junho? Kiho? - Cake! - Is this the cake you wanted? - Yes! Dad! Congratulations, my boy! You were great! - Cheers! To first place! Next time, you'll be first! - First place! - First place! Way to go, son! Happy? Didn't you tell him to quit? It's great to be good at something. He was almost first this time! Just by the touch. Great! Almost first! So the beatings worked? You used to be fourth because no one hit you? - What beatings? - Eat. My mistake. I was kidding. Say it again. Eat, Kiho. You! Come here. What's wrong? Come in here. Damn! Your coach hit you? Bastard. That's not it... It's because I wasn't concentrating. I should've focused. Go to your room. Go in now! You knew, didn't you? Tell me! Listen to me. I told you to have him swim as a hobby! How could he? He's gotta go to college on swimming! He had to get better! What about getting beaten up like that? - Come on. - That bastard is dead! What's with you! You're going to him? Stop it! What's his number! What the hell is his name! - Why do you want to know? - Tell me! It's Kim Gwang-su. What? You know him? Kim Gwang-su? With the southern accent? Yes. Damn it! Let's go. You wait in the car. You too, Junho. Remember me? You know me? We had drinks one time. I'm Junho's dad. Reporter Kim Young-hoon. You're Junho's dad? So what? I should thank you. He even won a medal. You don't look thankful. My son's got talent. Here. What's this? Don't hit him. I'm getting a bribe from a reporter? If you hit Junho again, I'll write articles. Soon, there will be special reports on the swimming federation. The federation will have to bow and apologize to the country. It'll be all over the Internet. Coach Kim Gwang-su... You'll never set foot in a pool again. How'd it go? He promised not to hit again. Really? It's a good thing you came. Right, Junho? Isn't your dad great? Train hard from now on. - Okay. - Concentrate! I'll pick you up later! Okay, bye. Look for another coach. Why? You got through to him. You gave him money. I'm more scared of Junho placing fourth than getting hit. Damn... Come out. You're 2 seconds slower than usual. Since your dad came, you'll slack off? No, sir. How many hits? I don't want to get hit. What did you say? Winning medals... without getting hit is true winning. - The process is important. - Says who? Your dad? Getting hit because I don't focus is wrong. That jerk is all talk! Know how two-faced your dad is? Don't put down my dad! Don't put my dad down! The hell? You don't know anything! Come out. Come out now! I'm warning you! I said, come out! Come out now! The hell is he going? Come out! Come out now! Stop it and come out! Kid! I got something to tell you! Come out! Come out now! I'm warning you, fool! Come out now! Why you little! Come here! Where is he? Hey! Hey! Damn it! Come here! Come here now! Where are you going! Stop right there! Come here now! Damn it. I got something to say! Junho! Come here! Come back! Kid! Shit!

Junho! Are you okay? What about training? Dad... I want to quit swimming. Still feel the same? Come here. Still set? Set on what? Junho's quitting swimming. What? What do you mean? He doesn't want to swim. Really mean it, Junho? Come here. Seriously? No, right? We tried so hard, Junho. We promised to win a medal. Tell me. Dad made you quit? Let's just eat. No... I want to quit. I don't want to get hit. Stop! Why! Who says you can quit! You have no right to quit! You ungrateful twerp! Stop it! We worked hard for this! You can't just quit swimming! - Go to your room. - Let go! I worked harder than you! You can't just quit! You ungrateful twerp! How could you! You twerp! I gotta talk to Junho! Come here! I gotta talk to Junho! Listen! - Stay out of this. - Come on. He's all bruised up! Forget swimming. You told him to quit, didn't you! No, I listened to him! If he hates it and you tell him to quit, of course he'll quit! He swam because he liked it. But... If life should deceive you... Don't be sad or angry. In the day of grief, submit. Merry days will come, believe. The heart lives in the future. The present is glum: In a moment, passes sorrow That which passes will be dear. If by life you were deceived, don't be mad or grieved. In the day of despair, be mild. Merry days will come, believe. Heart is living in tomorrow Present is dejected here. All will pass in a moment and become pleasant memories. If life should deceive you, don't be sad or angry. 'IF LIFE DECEIVES YOU' BY PUSHKIN On a day of low spirits, submit: A day of joy, believe, will come. I have to disaccredit you as a coach here. But I didn't hit the kid. You mean that? Think I'm lying? Ms. Kim! Come in here! The boy's dad is a reporter. You get what I'm saying? Hold on, sir. You're kicking me out because of him? When I got hit and asked him to write about it... Know what he said? That I got hit because I deserved it! His kid's swimming too! It's not dancing! Who hits kids these days? How else can you teach a kid with no will to win? Gwang-su... Beating kids to cut down their records is history. What did I do? His mom came asking to beat him to become first! The hell with the damn couple! Gwang-su! What is it? You know Junho quit swimming? So? Give back the lesson fee and money my husband gave you. I don't have it. Give me the money! What the hell? Go away! I don't want to see your face. What the hell? - Swindling bastard! - What? You're a crook, aren't you! Damn! Junho did... How dare you point fingers! Hey! Let go! Make Junho swim again! Make my son swim again! Just leave him be! He'll grow up well without you! Can't you teach Junho again? He can do it! Can't you teach him, please? He can do well! He can win medals! Without you, he can. Crazy bitch. Shit. Sleeping? Mom? I have to buy slippers. I have school stuff to buy. Take care, mom. Take care, mom. NATIONAL JUNIOR COMPETITIONS Kiho? You're done?

Didn't you hate swimming? What's with you? Are you a thief? Why sneak in there? Mom? I'm good at swimming. And I like it more than anything. So? You want me to place first even by getting hit? It doesn't matter if I place first? Let's go home, Junho. Sit. Want a drink? I want to swim, sir. I want to place first. With no desire to win, you can't. See the kids who place first. Their eyes are different. Your mom wants it more. She'd be good at swimming. Be honest. Did you ever want to be first? No. See! But now I want to place first. Only then... I can keep swimming. - Ma'am? - Yes? There's no one here, can't I smoke? No way! Damn! Won't even let me smoke! Your dad saw to it that I can't coach. I lost my lane. I'm sorry. No need for you to be sorry! But... Could you... Call my dad, please? For what? Promise you won't hit me? Fine. Call up your dad. Yes, sir. Hello? Your son came to me. He's begging me to hit and teach him swimming. What should I do? Fine! I hit him a few times. So what? To make a good kid do better, I had to! That's not even getting beaten. Think that's loving your son'? When you don't even know what your son is good at? You fool! Think I can't teach because you took my lane away! When your son wins a gold medal, be prepared to bow to me! Bye! Hey, Junho. Call your mom. Listen. I'll make a prediction. What? I'm not just saying this. Train on your own. You'll win gold. Ma'am! I'm leaving. Coach Kim! Your tab is over a month long! Okay, okay! You're killing me! Hey, kid! Got any money? How much is it? $183. But I only have $12. Kid!
