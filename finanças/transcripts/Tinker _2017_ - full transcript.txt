After leaving home, instead of going to Vietnam, I was sent to an undisclosed facility in the desert. We called it Koli. 32 of the brightest men, including myself, were teamed up into groups and assigned each their own tasks. The vetting process was mentally intense. So many questions. Confidential access was granted to those who passed. Our primary objective focused on research the government confiscated from Nikola Tesla after his demise. [snorts and gasps] [sighs] [groaning] [engine starts] [cows lowing] - [door hinges creak] - Hey, Miss Jeannie. Hold on just a minute. Hey, baby, how are you doing? Good, good. He's in the back if you want to go on. Yes, ma'am. [drill whirring] Hey, son. Morning. Dropping off or picking up? - Picking up. - Well, it'll be that black riding lawn mower on your right. It's going up to the Drinker's. Right out back on the right. [birds tweeting] [distant laughter and indistinct chatter] [Mary Ann] You about ready for bed? Do you remember what happened last? The man was... the fearless man was boarding the ship. That's right. Okay. "And the captain ventured off into the unknown, "searching for treasure. "But he knew there would be dangers, and a chance he would not return." That's all for tonight, okay? [Kai] Let's say our prayers. [Mary Ann] Yeah, let's say them. - Ready? - Ready. Now I lay me. Now I lay me. - Down to sleep. - Down to sleep. I pray the Lord. Pray the Lord. - My soul to keep. - My soul to keep. If I die. If I die. - Before I wake. - Before I wake. I pray the Lord. Pray the Lord. - My soul to take. - My soul to take. Good. Let's get you tucked in. Good night, sweetheart. [Kai] Good night. Love you, Mom. [Mary Ann] I love you, too. [vibrating] Hello? Uh-huh. Can you give me the exact...? So the meds didn't work. Okay. [sniffles] [sobs] [sniffles and cries] [sighs] Hey, buddy, you ready for school? Are you okay, Mama? Yeah, honey, I'm okay. I'll go get your uniform, okay? Okay. [sighs] [humming softly] [mumbling] [Boudreaux] Grady! Dimensions are specific. - Then what...? - [door locks click] These crystals were my father's. Crystals hold energy. If you learn to listen, you can hear their sounds. They were programmed. By placing them out at the right time, day or night, you can hear the sounds of the sun or the moon, and all the other things that other people can't hear. What about that one? This one...

At this point, we have proven that his magnetic power generator we call Jack, combined with a Tesla coil, stimulates plant growth successfully, reducing harvest time by half. But the plants have to be in close proximity. We are impressed with the results. However, I have my reservations. There's something they're not telling us. [phone rings] - Hello? - [woman, on phone] Yes. - Is this Grady Lee, Jr.? - Yes, this is him. This is the office of Ethan Gosser, - attorney at law. - Mm-hmm. We regret to inform you your sister, Mary Corregan, she's passed away. The circumstances are urgent, and we would like your presence within 24 hours. Okay. It's gonna take me about 11 hours to get over there. Thank you. [radio host] It's coming out on different levels. For example, agrosonics, the use of sounds to interact with plants to make them grow faster. There's even more research that they can target specific frequencies for specific plants, and they can accelerate growth by 50, a hundred times. I wish you could stay longer. [wind gusting] [receptionist] Uh-huh. Yeah, we can do 12:30. Great, see you then. Thanks. [coughs] [door opens] Mr. Lee? Come on back. - How are you doing? - [Grady] Okay. We're here today because your sister, Mary Ann Corregan, passed away. She has hired me to write her last will and testament. She also hired me to be the executor of her will. She doesn't have any debt. She had some personal property. She had no real property, meaning she had no real estate. She rented her apartment. She had a small amount of money, and she also appointed you as guardian of her son, Kai. [inaudible] Mr. Lee? Now it's up to you whether or not you want to be Kai's guardian. Well, what happens to him if I don't take him? If you don't, he'll be remanded to the state of Virginia. We'll place him inside of foster care. Okay. Okay? - I'll take him, yeah. - Perfect. There will be a package and a letter from your sister sent to your home on Kai's seventh birthday. I'm hungry. Wow, you live on a farm? How many acres do you have? Wow. Like the house. [birds tweeting] I'm hungry. Who's that guy outside? Oh, Manna? Who's Manna? He's just a fella that... helps me out with a few things around the house. What's he work on with you? Splitting wood, feeding the chickens and cows, stuff like that. He's your partner? Manna just kind of needed a place to hide for... a little while, and he's just passing through. He's a good fella. [grunts] I see you met our new visitor. This is Kai. Kai, this is Manna. How you doing? Kai, come on, load up. I got the tractor waiting for you. Hey. Get the shop cleaned out, get my welding gear out. [high-pitched tone] Now listen, I don't want you fooling around climbing on anything, all right? Well, here it is. [Kai] Why are we here? Where is this? It's a salvage yard. You ever seen a salvage yard before? Of course not. I live in the city. What car are we getting parts from? I don't know. Got to find it first. That's part of the fun, though. The exploring. Looking in stuff, finding what you need. It's kind of like a... like a treasure hunt. What do you say? Good idea. Good idea? All right. All right, remember what I told you. All right? Don't climb on nothing. - Yes, sir. - Okay, here. Oh, oh. Um... Boudreaux, this is... this is Kai. A little buddy of mine's gonna be waiting for a little while. And stay out of his way, all right? - Yes, sir. - [Grady] Goddang it. These arms might work for you. [gags] You all right? Yeah, something went down my throat. I almost choked. [alarm clock beeping] Get up. [newscaster, on TV] An hour-long investigation into the dangers facing the U.S. power grid. What would it take to bring it down? And if our system did break down, how would you survive? And what would it be like in the dark? [Mary Ann] My dearest Kai. Happy birthday, sweetheart. I'm sorry that I can't be there with you. If I had one wish, it would be to watch you grow up and become the amazing person I know you will be. [newscaster, on TV] The United States electric grid. Are we ready for a terror attack or EMP blast? And what would we do if the lights went out? This is awesome. Don't thank me. Thank your mama. [whispers] Thank you, Mom. [Mary Ann] I'll always miss our walks by the river, our alone times, and being surprised by the things that you say. I gave Grady something for you so you can look to the heavens. You can use this to find yourself. You're always looking to heaven. It's like you see things that no one else can. God works in mysterious ways, and he outdid himself with you. Always remember, I'm closer than you think. I love you, sweetheart. Think I can see the moon already. [Grady, Sr.] December 24th, 1970. Merry Christmas. Today, we had a breakthrough. Team seven was testing a device that emits massive amounts of frequencies. We are not privy to the details of other projects, but heard their result resembled that of an EMP. Sector E was completely immobilized. And our Jack woke up on its own. We will be combing through the data for weeks. I'm beginning to rethink protocol. What are you doing? I fix. Lawn mowers and weed eaters. Doesn't look like that. Because I'm not working on that right now. I'm working on something different. Then what are you working on right now? Hmm, it's a surprise. What's this on the board? What's on the board? Different things. Hmm. [bell dings] Can you go find something to do outside please, sir? What are these? Stuff. Whose is this? That's my daddy's. Where's your daddy? He ain't around anymore. Where did he move to? He ain't move nowhere. He passed on. Is he where my mother is? My mom is in heaven. Yeah? Do you know anything about that? No. I don't know about all that kind of fairy-tale stuff. [Kai] It's not a fairy tale. Buddy, if that makes you feel better, then you believe that. [sniffles] I'll go outside if you need me to. Why don't you go outside and find you something to do, little man? [door opens and closes] Mm-hmm. Go on up there. Well? Who built this tree house? My daddy. He built it for me and your mama. - [Kai] Oh. - Mm-hmm. Okay, you have fun up there. [Kai] Yes, sir. But, I mean, what can I do, though? Well, when we get there, just make sure my real beard's not showing. - You know, that kind of thing. - I can do that. I don't mind helping you. I'll be right there. Good. I'll help you before, during, after, whatever. - I don't care. - [Grady] Knock, knock. - [Jeannie] Hey! - Lookie here. [Jeannie] Hey, Kai, how are you? What are you doing? I was wondering if Kai could hang out with you for a while. Yeah, absolutely. We would love to. - Good. - [Jeannie] Yeah. You want to come stay with us? I got some toys out back, and we'll go play. - Hey, how's that sound? - Does that sound good? - I got to do some... - Please? Come on, listen, I got to do a little bit of work. I'll come back, okay? Just hang out here. [Jeannie] He'll come right back, I promise you. [Grady] Listen, Come on, now. It's all right. - Stop hanging... - [Jeannie] Come on, baby. Oh! Oh, come on, that wasn't necessary. Come on, buddy. Come on. Come on with me. It's okay... - [Kai, sobbing] No! - [Jeannie] Oh, please. - I'll be back. - [Jeannie] Come on, baby. It's going to be great, okay? Okay? - [Grady] I'll check back in. - [Jeannie] It's okay... Oh. - No! No! - Oh. Oh, baby. Baby, come on. - [door slams] - Come on. Come on. [Kai] No. I don't want to! [Jeannie] Oh, I'm so sorry. I believe you've got me in a mess here. I'm fixing to get jumped. So, how you been? Why is Grady so mean? Grady's not really mean. He's kind of got a little bit of hard heart right now. Ever since he was little. When he was five, his mother died. She had an aneurysm. That affected him very much. And he's lost his dad later on, which was my friend. What was his name? Grady, Senior. Your grandfather. And when he lost your mama, he lost a big chunk of his heart. It could be one of the reasons he screams, he loses his temper. But he loved her very, very much. Sometimes that calluses people. It makes them hard in their heart. - Understand? - Yes. And we just say a little prayer, and we'll try to get through it together. - How about that, buddy? - Mm-hmm. We got to get over that wall he's built. You think you can help old Big Papa over that wall? Mm-hmm. All right. You needed something? Can you do that for me? Well, I can give it a shot. For your eyes only. Thanks for stopping by. - [gas hisses] - [flames roar] Hey, Manna. What? Do you have a son? No. What is it like to live on a farm? Like living anywhere else, son. Do you have a wife? Nope. What do you feed your cows? What do you feed your chickens? You know... you ask a lot of questions. Go play with someone your own age. I can't find anyone. Yeah, well... I can't climb out of the gates around this place. Listen, why don't you go on home? All right? Your dad's calling you. He's not my dad. Maybe you should go inside then, son. I don't have a home. Not everybody does. What does your dog eat? Just go on back. Tell me and I'll give you a penny. What do I have to do for you to answer my question? Just go home! Just go home, all right? - I don't have a home! - No one wants you around here. Just go home! Leave me alone! I'm working! [Kai] I'm going home! Good. Son! No, hey! Come on! Get me out of here! Moses! Where's Moses? Get it open! - Let me out of here! - There you go, come on. - Get me out of here! - It's okay. Oh, my leg! Ow! Moses. [sniffles] [blows] [panting] [gasps and sobs] Manna. What's up, brother? Come on in, man. It's time for you to tell your story. You tell it. My name is, uh... My name is Manna. I guess I'll start off with, uh... I'm a vet. I done three tours. I'm not a hero. I, uh... I didn't want to serve my country. I just wanted to be able to provide for my family. Food on my table. It was just me and my boy. And, uh... You know, my son, six at the time, he, uh... he didn't really know me too well. So I planned a trip, you know? We drove from lower... the lower part of Florida to Alabama, and... I got... I got discharged because... because of an accident. [scoffs] It's funny, you know? An accident. Accident. It's not really what it sounds like. [sobs] I hate myself! And I just want to lay next to him. I don't care if he's six foot deep. I just want my boy. The sound that I can't... I can't get out of my head. [car horn blaring] [groans] What? [engine shuts off] Moses. My son. My son in the back. Moses. My son. - Help my son. - Okay. [Grady grunting] [Manna sobbing] I killed my baby. I killed him. I killed him. God, please, just take me away, please. Please just take me away. I don't want to be here anymore. [sniffles] [sobbing] You did good, man. You did good. Okay? It's what we're all here for. Just let it go. All right, I got it. I got it. That'd be 1S 09. [electronic hum] The same number of degrees out there. Uh... Ah! That's the alignment. Now I got the position. Hey, bud. I just want to tell you I love you. Daddy's not going to be back for a while, okay? Manna. Thanks, bud. Welcome. Love you, buddy. I'm sure he's looking down right now. Thanks, buddy. Come on, let's get you out of here. Manna? How you doing, son? Where'd them come from? It's by Mr. Ware and Mr. Self. Hold up a minute. Where are you headed? I got Kai in the truck. I can't find Manna, so... You can't find Manna? He came to the meeting last night. He got up and spoke. Bared it all. Told the whole story. You need to find him. Where are we going? [Grady] Uh-uh, no, no. You stay in this car. Uh-uh, you stay right here. It's looking good. - [Boudreaux] All right, Grady. - Hmm? - I'm getting on out. - [Grady] Mm-hmm. I'm, uh... You look to the stars. I look to the stars. A lot of people say fools look to the stars. We're not wrong. I want to give you something. Four sides. Four different winds. The energy comes from all around you and it's drawn to the earth. You understand? Thank you. You're welcome, Kai. - [Grady] Kai! - Sir? Get away from there! Go to your room! [chickens peeping] [panting and whimpering] [crying] [electric humming] [humming powers down] Hmm. Why won't you work? Hmm. [door creaks open] Kai. [door closes] Kai. Kai! Kai! Kai! Kai! Kai! What do you build the top out of? Sticks and twine. Sticks and twine. Pretty cool, huh? Mm-hmm. Where'd you get all the sticks? All that wood out in your yard? Young man, them woods, they provide everything. Even your firewood? That's right. Is most of the stuff you have homemade? I have a little bit of everything out here, buddy. I don't like living with Grady. I like staying here. - Really? - Mm-hmm. What's going on over there, buddy? He... he never plays with me. He's just always in the workshop or away doing something else. He's obsessing over that blasted machine. It'll be all right. I bet I could fix it. Probably. Probably could. [chuckles] [sighs] Listen, I... I'm sorry for yelling at you yesterday. It's okay. That machine's just very special to me. Grady, can I show you something? Mm-hmm. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Trust me. Now try. [electric humming] [electricity crackles] I told you to trust me. [laughs] Thank you. You're welcome. [moaning] [Grady, Sr.] March 23rd, 1971. More members have been put under my watch. Failure, over and over. We're on the edge of a breakthrough, just to have success ripped from our grasps. Jack will not stabilize. Something's got to be missing. We've combed every page. We have to make this work. We're obsessed. If Jack can double or triple crop production, the advancements would change the food and medical industry as we know it. [electrical humming] [humming powers down] [thunder rumbling] February 29th, 1972. Today was a devastating day. We lost seven team members. We have no idea what Jack is capable of. We pushed too hard. He quickly became unstable. But the power. Dr. Corregan, he introduced the special crystals to harness the energy. Never heard of such a thing, but it was brilliant. This changes everything. [door opens] - [door closes] - Grady, you okay? So before my father became a farmer, he was a scientist. Mostly government research, classified. He even won a couple of awards. And... I found his journal, and I found a lot of his research. And it's full of diagrams, and... this. Does this look familiar? - I made that. - Mm-hmm. Now, according to the research, and it took me awhile to get my mind wrapped around exactly what it is that I had here, but it seems from what I can gather that the machine works off of magnetism, and it creates its own power and emits electromagnetic fields. Essentially wireless electricity. Think of like, oh, um... water ripples after a stone is falling in. And I'm not sure exactly, but this could emit an energy field that goes on not just for miles, but hundreds of miles. And it says here that the magnetic waves can stimulate plant activity in a way that we've never thought before. I just need you to help me build these components. So, if you think of it, think of the components setting down into it, which will allow it to spin. And according to the information, that's going to c... create the electricity. So... You want this to spin? [Grady] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I can do it. Hmm. Okay. [Randy] Look at you people. My goodness gracious. Hello, everyone. - Hey! - How are you doing? - Randy! - [Randy] Oh, Aunt Meeko! Oh, I can't believe you. - Oh, you sweetie. - [laughs] Well, good to see everyone. Looks like we're missing one, but that'll be okay. Well, no, I guess we're not missing one. Better late than never, I guess. It's been a memorable and wonderful life. Pretty day. [grunts] - Pretty ladies all around me. - [laughs] Could have told you that. I'm honored for y'all to be here, thanks. [applause] Can't believe I made it. Sixty years. Pretty smile. Kai! Come here. You'll freeze to death, you fall in that water. [Boudreaux] Let me introduce you to my niece, Abby. Nice to meet you. Want to go walk across the bridge? Sure, let me just take off my jacket. - [Boudreaux] I got it. - Grady, come here. Come here, I want to talk to you a little bit. Give me your hand. I want to hold your hand. Put your hand out. Come on, give me your hand. Give me your hand. Thank you for fixing my lawn mower. Grady... fathers have nothing to do with blood. Be a father. Be a real father, like Randy was for you. - I, uh... - I know what I'm talking about. You're in the same situation now. With Kai. Remember that, Grady. [Kai] What's your favorite thing to do in school? Science, math? [Abby] I love reading and science. It's pretty fun. [Kai] Mm-hmm. You know that everything on Earth vibrates? And I can actually hear it? What does it sound like? Hmm. It just hums. Do you remember what... what... what cont... which state's shaped like a boot? I bet you can't remember. I can't. Man, it's cold out here. Here, you can have my jacket. I don't care. Thanks. Here, I think I want to show you something. Can you move back? These are some crystals my mom gave to me when she passed away. [Abby] Wow, they're beautiful. [Kai] Supposedly they're programmed for something special. At the right time of day and the right time I'm outside, it'll adsorb energy from the sun. And if they're inside Jack, they'll work. [Jeannie] Ooh. You'd better say no. Uh-oh. [truck door opens and closes] Did you have a good time driving them crazy? [Randy] I don't think we bored him too bad. Why don't you come on in a minute, Grady. I need to talk to you. I got something to show you. Come on. I don't have time to come inside. What can I help you with, Randy? [sighs] This is the key. You've had this the whole time? Look, you've gotten farther than I ever thought you would. I hid it from you for your own protection. How dare you. - I'm trying to help you. - You knew what this meant to me. And shame on you for not giving this to me sooner. Shame on me? I raised you, son. You need to do that boy the same way. You don't need to worry about what I do with that boy! You scream at me anymore, you hickory head, I'm trying to help you. [Jeannie] Calm down, Grady. You'd better listen. It killed your father. It's going to kill you. You hear me? [truck door opens and closes] You're just going to have to let him go. Just got to let him go. Okay? [coughs] Oh... oh... What is it? What? What is it? - [groans] - No, no, Randy. Listen... oh, my God. I'm going to call 911, okay? Grady! Grady! [breathing heavily] I need you over here. I need you to make room. [monitors beep] [wind gusting] You look nice. So do you. Be strong tonight, okay? Okay. [Meeko] He came here for a little while, but he's gone back. I love Randy. Randy's not here. A few years ago, remember when I got so sick? I died. No heart. No lungs. No brain. And that's why I can stand here and say he's not in this pot. Eternity is our home. I know that. It's for sure. It's true. ♪ You can't mix your tears ♪ ♪ With those From an agave plant ♪ ♪ You see, I've danced With him myself ♪ ♪ He's never been a friend ♪ [Grady] Randy was always the kind of man that did the right thing... without having to chirp in everybody's ear about it. Wouldn't look for somebody to pat him on the back. You know, recently someone told me about a... someone told me being a father is not about blood. It's about accepting an opportunity to do what's right by another human being. I can accept that same responsibility, and... do what's right. I appreciate everybody coming out here tonight. It'd make him... it would fill him up. Thank you. [Grady, Sr.] Randy, you have been a dear friend to me. Like a brother. I leave with you the key to my life's work. They unlock hidden information that, one day, the world will be ready for. But it's not now. People are close to finding Jack, and we're no longer safe. When the time comes, I trust you will do right by me and potentially find capable hands that can complete my work. As far as the other, thanks for taking Grady. It means so much. We're done for the day. That reminds me of somewhere. Come on. Um... - Thanks. - ...here you go. Uh, let me see. One, two. And the biggest one. Okay. Big crystal, big crystal. This... this. That's how the legend says it's supposed to be. It'll be awesome if it was. Uh-huh. We should at least let them stay here for four minutes, then we'll try it in a different location. If that doesn't work, well, I don't know what to say. I think if you set them out with the way that all the shadows are showing, it will gain more power. See? See how the sun goes through these crystals? Look at its shadow. That's pretty cool. We should let these sit out for awhile. [Abby] All right, let's go. Abby, does it look like it's pointing towards the middle? Yeah, it looks good. But here, let me help you a little. The light will be coming in just in time. Is it supposed to be pointing to the crystal in the middle? Right. What now? I don't really know. But there's only one way to find out. Hand me that pot. - Here you go. - Thank you. This light could blind you. Can you leave the cabin? Okay. Kai, be careful. I will. [high-pitched hum] Kai? Kai, where are you? Kai? Kai? Mr. Grady! [Mary Ann] Crystals hold energy. You can hear their sounds. These crystals were my father's. They were programmed. What are you doing here? The crystals worked, Mom. They worked. The crystals. I knew you'd figure out the crystals. What do you mean? What's important is that Grady can't finish without you. Jack reacts to harmony. And you can help him with that. You can hear the tones needed to program it. God gave you a gift, sweetheart. And this is how you can use it to make a difference in the world. I want to stay here, Mom. Sweetheart. Now remember, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there. It's okay. Will you help Grady? [Abby] Mr. Grady! No, get on, now. Go on. - [Abby] Mr. Grady! - [Grady] Yeah, darling? Hyah! Get on. - Mr. Grady. - Mm-hmm? He's gone. He was there, now he's gone. - Who's gone? - Kai! He just disappeared. What do you mean he disappeared? I don't know what happened. How long's he been gone? That bucket was to protect him. Protect him from what? Kai! What happened, Abby? We were both in here. He told me to go outside because the light would blind me, but then when I came back in he wasn't there. He was just gone. We were just building this time machine project. [Grady] What's this? My drawing. [Grady] Your drawing? Who's this right here? I don't know who they are. [thunder rumbles distantly] Kai! Kai! [car door sensor beeps] What are you doing? I went to see my mom. [thunder crashes] How'd you get out there? Grady, can I show you something? [Grady] "Then the captain ventured off into the unknown, "hoping to find treasure. "But he knew there were dangers, and a chance that he would not return." I know this story. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Would you like me to read something else? Grady... will you ever leave me? I'm not going anywhere, buddy. Okay? "So the captain loaded up his ship "with the men that he had left, and he ventured out into what was to be a new adventure." Is 528 the right number? That's what we're trying to get it to. Okay. [electrical humming and whirring] [electricity crackles] [Grady] Whoo! [Randy] Well, there's something to say about an honest man who doesn't give up. Someone so committed that it propels them higher. Not for recognition, but for satisfaction. Helps people, even when he'd rather not. My father would tell me the only thing a man has is his word. With it, he could set an example and set the next generation. I gave my word to my friend Grady, kept it the best I could. And because of it, I experienced the joy of being a father, and watching his son become a man. [Grady] You know, me and my daddy, we used to... we used to come out here and watch the sunset together. You know? It was a... it was our one time of the day we could spend time together. You know, actually, the sun doesn't set. The Earth spins. Subtitles by explosiveskull
