- Ew, don't even bring that dude up okay. Cory Terence is brody as fuck so just stop please, before I throw up. - I thought you were like his secret lover. - Yeah right he wishes I was his secret lover. He probably has a shrine of me or some shit in his room. - You don't feel a little bad for the guy? - Why should I feel bad? All I said to the guy was fuck off and die, at least now he might get the point. - I don't know, he's probably still madly in love with you. Even if you did totally embarrass the fuck out of him today. - Whatever, he totally embarrassed himself. Anyway, I thought we were talking about cute guys, not Cory Terence, you're totally killing my boner right now. - Morgan I heard that, get off the phone right now. - Do you ever knock or what? - Not in my own house I don't, now get off. - Daddy it's Gina Rice. - I don't care if it's Jesus Christ, hang it up. - Hey boo, I gotta go, my dad just rolled in here like the fucking cavalry. - OMG. - Yeah I'll call you later. - No you won't. - What is your deal? - The deal is you're grounded young lady, now what is it about that you don't seem to understand. - I understand fine okay, don't treat me like I'm fucking five. - Then don't act like it, and watch your language alright. At your age if I was to cuss at my dad, the way that you do he'd have beat the shit out of me. - That's because he was a manic depressive alcoholic. - Enough, no more of this smart ass shit, alright. - Alright, jeese Louise, talk about cussing you should wash your mouth out with soap. - Oh Morgan, I don't know what I'm gonna do with you. - Well you could start with ungrounding me. - Yeah I don't think so. - This is so not fair. - No, what's unfair is what I caught you doing in my house while I was gone. And if your mother was alive she'd say the same thing. - Well she's not, so don't rub that one in my face okay. - Look, I'm running late enough as it is, what I need for you to do-- - Where are you going? - Out, to dinner. - With who? - Who do you think? - Not Brynn. - Yes of course Brynn. - Oh gag me. - I don't understand you Morgan, what is your problem with her? - Nothing except for the fact that she's a steaming pile of bitch, she's totally fake. - Well like it or not honey, that fake pile of bitch just might be your stepmother one day. - And I will fling myself off the balcony, I swear I'll do it. - I don't have time for this, I've gotta go. Did you give Grandma her pills yet? - I'm sorry. - Sweetheart, I've told you a million times, it's imperative she take those pills. - Where the hell is Derosa? - I gave her the weekend off, besides it's not her job to take care of her. - Why all of a sudden is it my responsibility? Can we not like hire somebody to take care of her? - Do you want to pay for it? I didn't think so. Now look I'm gonna be gone til about midnight, so be sure to take real good care of Grandma alright. - Fine, you're gonna be late for Brynn. - Oh and no boys Morgan, I mean it. I better not catch that little boy toy of yours creeping around my house anymore, we clear. - Totes daddy, better go now, don't wanna keep Miss Brynn waiting. - David McKenzie's office. Hello. Can I help you? Who is this? My fucking God. Shit. You're gonna catch a cold Grandma. Grandma? I forgot to give you your pills I know, but I'm gonna bring them to you okay. - I can already feel my insides failing me now. - Your pills are gonna make you feel better Grandma, but you gotta eat something before I can give them to you. - I heard a phone ringing downstairs. - I know I'm sorry, I don't know who it was. So, did you want something? - I want some soup, some cheese dip soup. - Cheese dip soup? - Something hot, something wet. My colon feels like it's all blocked up. - I don't know if we have any such thing as cheese dip soup Grandma, even if we did I don't think it's gonna help your colon any. - You just make it for me, and fix me some coffee too while you're at it. - Fine, I'll do it but before you get any sicker you may want to think about putting some clothes on Grandma. - You should think about putting on more clothes dear. - Grandma what are you doing? - You're not still dressing up like a little harlot are yah? - Let me go. - Harlot, she brings nothing but chaos and disorder, she carries it like a plague. - Let go! I have to go get the soup and the coffee too remember. - Make it fast dear. It gets so lonely up here, so dreadfully lonely. You hurry back now dear, I'll be waiting for you. I always do. - Morgan you've been a bad girl, bad girl. Morgan. - Hello, who is this? - Oh that's it. Oh. - What? - Ask me again, I wanna hear you. - I'm hanging up right now. - Oh God, when you talk, I love it. Gonna be together, you and me, close together. - Hey listen to me you have the wrong fucking number okay. - Oh fuck, that's it's Morgan, that's it baby, tell me. Oh I want you to feel this, I know you can feel this. You're little this. - Morgan! - Mother you're dead. - I'm here all the time with you, with daddy, with Grandma upstairs, everywhere. Forever and always. - Please don't do this to me. - Oh honey, I'm afraid you do this to yourself. - Stop it, you've been dead for over a year now. - Why do you keep saying that? I could never leave you. Never. - But you did, you're dead. Just talk to me. I want to know what happened by the pool mother. Wait. Grandma where you at? - I'm here all the time. - What are you frightened of dear? - Nothing I just, I saw the window was open, I don't know. - Did you think I jumped out? - What were you doing Grandma? - Well I had to go really bad. - That is disgusting. - I got tired of ringing the bell, I had to go, so I went. - I didn't hear you ring the bell. - I rung it for a long, long time. - Mother fucking smoke alarm, I swear to God. - You really ought to come quick when I ring the bell hun. - I told you I didn't hear a bell. I was making God damn cheese dip soup, whatever the fuck that is, I fucked it up the first time, so I had to make it the second time, and now it's ruined. - No it isn't dear, it's not, not yet it's not. - Yes it is, everything is so fucked right now. - Oh no, everything's fine dear, you'll see. Look let me just show you here, it's gonna be okay. Look. - Grandma what are you doing, stop. - You see, you see it's good, it's fine. I'm eating it, nothing's gonna be ruined. - Fine, just stay down there for all I care, I've gotta get something to clean this up. - It aint as bad as it seems. - Whatever, just promise me for the love of God, you're not gonna lap up what's in the closet over there. - Eat what's in the closet, honestly. - Is everything good here Mr McKenzie? - Wonderful Alexandra, thank you. - Excuse me, this sushi tastes like a bottom feeding cat fish, get it out of here please. And bring us another bottle of wine whenever you can fit it in. - Absolutely ma'am, I am so sorry about that. - Don't apologize. - Is there anything else I can get for you sir? - We're fine. As many times as we've come here, you would think that they would not forget the bloody wine. - I know, I know, look sweetheart is everything alright, you seem a little agitated? - It's nothing, sometimes I just wish my God damn it's husband would go ahead and croak the bastard. - Oh no, what did he do this time? - Well the son of a bitch is trying to hit me up again for more child support, as if he hadn't already bled me dry. Are we allowed to smoke in here? - Of course not, come on. - Oh Preston's throne. - I don't see why you don't just go ahead and fight for full custody. - Have you ever met my daughter David? The little heathen doesn't deserve a mother. - Oh come on Brynn, every girl deserves a mother. Shit, as spoiled as my daughter is, she sure could use a mothers influence right now. - You don't think you can handle her? - No I do, it's just she doesn't ever want to listen to me. - So I've heard. - You know when Diana was alive, Morgan used to do everything I said, or everything she said at least. I don't know things were just different back then. - She might just need to face the facts David, that your wife is dead, and she's going to have to start facing the future very soon. It can be frightening for young girls at her age, but also very necessary. - Yeah, she just lacks guidance. - I think it's discipline she lacks David, not guidance. I mean let's face it, she continues to act out without the slightest bit of concern for the consequences. - She's just confused, that's all. - Well I realize she's your daughter, but I can't help but feel the reason she's so wayward lately 'cause you're not seeing each other. - I think it's a lot of things actually, but you know, tonight I came out and told her I was taking you out to dinner, no if, in's or buts. - And what did she have to say about that? - I think she was okay with it. Actually I think she's starting to get used to the idea of you being around a lot more. - Well good, because I told the little darling one day that I was going to be a very huge part of her life, whether she liked it or not. You just have to be firm with kids these days, as hard as it may seem. - You're absolutely right, I feel like I've been laying down the law a lot more though here lately. It's just she's so damn bull headed sometimes. - She's like her father. In all seriousness though David, you've been extremely lenient on her. You're much more tolerant then I am. If it had been me who'd caught my daughter going down on her boyfriend in my Jacuzzi, well I probably would have strangled her to death. - I know trust me, I'm trying to get it all off my mind right now you know. - Yes well I can imagine a sight such as that, sticking in the back of your mind. - Exactly, it's just weird. I mean every time I look at her, that's all I see now, her doing that. - Hmm, in that case, I might have an idea. Perhaps there's something I could do to help you get it out of your mind. - Shit. - Still thinking about your daughter. - God no. - Good, because the only thing in your mind right now should be me sucking the life out of your cock. - I was gonna say the same thing. - Relax, no more nasty thoughts about your dirty little daughter. - Are we really doing this, you're fucking nuts. - I'm just fucking crazy, but that's what you love about me, isn't it? - Oh yeah. - Isn't it? - Oh yeah. - Say it, I love crazy, say it. - I love crazy! - Oh my God! Robbie, what the fuck? What do you think you're doing, creeping on me like that? - Oh you loved it girl, don't even lie. Seeing what you were doing there, having fantasies about me or what? - Fuck no, get over yourself. - You look so fucking hot right now. - Well you don't, so fuck off. - Damn you're in a weird ass mood tonight aren't you. - You're the weird ass dude, creeping on me like that. - I tried to call you like a hundred fucking times, you didn't answer. - I know my dad has my phone. You better not have sent me any nasty shit either, he's probably going through it right now. - Got your ass on lock down huh? - Fuck yeah dude, while he goes out and plays with his whore. - His whore? - He's got this bitch girlfriend Brynn. I can't stand her arse, and she totally knows it. She wants like all of his time. - Does this piss you off? - I mean not really, I don't really give two shits about what they do. - Good, you shouldn't, 'cause that gives more time for me and you. - You're such a weirdo. You're so not even supposed to be here right now. If my dad knew you were here, he'd shoot your arse right in your face. - Yeah well what daddy don't know won't phase him, will it? - What are you doing? - Can I not get a kiss. - Seriously, I just told you I got in an arse load of trouble for that and you're seriously gonna ask me that. - So, what the fuck. - It just seems like when we kiss it always leads to other stuff. Let's just smoke a bong. - Uh, man that's all you ever want to do. - No it's not. - Bullshit, since always when you're not passing out on me. - I'll have you know sir that I only pass out when I'm drunk, not when I'm high. - Oh is that right. - That's right God damn it. - Well look here I aint gonna sit and argue with you all night girl. If you wanna get fucking high that's fine by me. You gotta smoke some of what I brung though. - What'd you bring me? - You ever have Salvia. - Okay so I've never actually smoked this before, but I've seen a lot of videos on it. - Yeah I know, most of them are pretty fucked up too. - I'm not gonna like freak out am I? - Nah, you'll be good. You're just gonna see some crazy shit for a while, but it only lasts like five minutes. - I'm kinda nervous. - What, nervous? - I know, I mean usually I handle my shit like a pro, but it's like I'm having a panic attack for some reason. You may have to talk me up a little bit. - No girl, you got this shit. Morgan I know aint scared of nothing. - Fucking right. - You're like the drug queen. - I like your attitude sir. - So we doing this or what? - Oh my God, stop peer pressuring me or I'm not gonna do it. Oh fuck. - What's wrong? - Fucking brain freeze. - So you're trying to tell me that the same bad ass bitch that punked out Cory Terence in front of the whole school is afraid of a little bit of Salvia. - Oh my God, speaking of did I show you the love letter that pervo left me the other day? - Nah, is this before or after you went off on him. - After, he stuffed it in my locker, that shit was sticky and everything. Fucking lurker. - For real though, did you read the letter yet? - Yeah dude. - And what'd it say? - I'll just let you read it if you want, shit's pretty fucked up. - Hell yeah I wanna read that shit, you got it with you? - Yeah come on. - No way, this dudes a fucking Looney Tune. I like how he wrote in blood red letters. - Ew, I don't, fucking wigs me out. - My dearest Morgan, I sit and look at you in Study Hall and I'm constantly reminded of how much beauty there truly is in my dark, lonely world. When I see your silky blonde hair it brightens up my darkest day. I always think of a fire burning in a snowy log cabin. Really? - Keep reading, it gets better. - Sometimes I just want to hold onto you forever, and never let you go. I've thought of ways to try to tell you this, but I don't want to come off as some kind of jerk who doesn't know what love really is. Does this dude want me to pound his fat arse or what? - Read what it says at the bottom. - I'm tired of always trying to find ways to express myself to you. I feel like the reason you always avoid me is because deep down you're afraid to confront your true feelings about me. I'm tired of this dude thinking he's some kind of poet. That's what I'm tired of. - Read what he says at the end, he's fucking psycho. - I feel like if you don't go out with me real soon, I'm gonna have to explode, you wouldn't want that would you? I feel I would squeeze you so tight while you looked into my eyes, squeeze you tight under the moonlight until you changed your mind. Under my control you would finally find out what a great guy I truly am. You would definitely see me as husband material, or at least I hope you would. Anyway, I hope you would make up your mind real soon, whether or not you want to be with me. After all, I would seriously hate it if the only way we could be together was if we die together. - Pretty fucked up right. - Has anyone else read this? - No, why? - There's a fucking death threat girl. - What? - This mother fuckers threatening your life, I know it. - Shut up. - Hell no, this shit's serious. That letter's got death written all over it. - Dude, shut the fuck up, it's not funny. - I'm not trying to be funny, that dudes got a serious problem for real. Did you even read what he said? He said he wanted for you and him to die together. - I know, I know what the letter says okay, and if you're gonna keep scaring me all night, you can leave the same damn way you came in. - Look I'm just saying, dudes nutty as fuck man. I wouldn't put shit past him. - Alright, okay, I'm over it. I'm done talking about Cory Terence. - Well you can't just ignore shit like that Morgan. - I'm not ignoring anything. Hello. Hello. - Perfect puss, here kitty kitty, come for me. - Who is this. - I wanna be so close to you right now. Just right up next to you. - Okay look here fucker, you need to quit fucking around and harassing me okay. - Who is that? - Some fucking loser, keeps calling me, won't leave me alone. - What the fuck's he saying? Morgan, I wanna see how wet and juicy you get for me. - What you just say chum. Who the fuck is this? Oh so now you're not gonna say shit. Well if you dial this number again man you're gonna get your arse beat alright. - What'd he say? - Nothing, not a damn thing. Why don't you just take that shit off the hook? - It's my dads work line. - Who gives a shit? - He does, he'd fucking kill me. - How many times has this asshole called? - I don't know, it doesn't really matter okay. It just fucking pisses me off, he's gotta know who I am too. - How'd you know that? - 'cause he knows my dads work number and I heard him shouting my name while he was blowing his wad so. - No fucking way. Has any of it occurred to you at all that it could possibly be Cory Terence making all these calls? - Of course it has, and maybe it is, but maybe I don't want to know. - What are you gonna do if he keeps calling back? - Fuck it, he won't. - Seriously, I don't think you're ready for this. - I don't think your moms ready for this. - I'm about to smack you in the face. - Good I like it rough. - You know what I like, I like these luscious legs. These adorable little footsies. - Stop looking at my feet you little weirdo. - How does that make me a weirdo? - Uh you have a foot fetish. - I have a Morgan fetish. - Stop. - What? - I already told you you're not getting any. - You used to be fun man, what happened to you? - I got grounded, that's what happened. Give me the lighter. - You're gonna do it now. - Might as well, fuck it right. - I thought you were gonna bitch out on me. - Well then you thought like Ned, and Ned thought his arse was his head. - Whoa nice, hold it in, hold it in. Oh nice, that was a fucking hit and a half right there. You feeling anything yet. - Uh uh. - You good? - Uh, I think so, I think, maybe I'm starting to feel it. - Is it kicking in? - I think so. Well, well, well. - What is it? - Your face, stop. - Stop what? - Whatever it is you're doing. I can't handle it right now. Oh my God, this is like, I can't even say. - Say what? - Wait a second, you said. You're doing anything straight right, right, right. - I told you to what? - Don't do this to me, you said it. - I'm not doing anything, I swear. You'll be good in five minutes, trust me. - My legs are not moving right now. - They're not, but they look perfectly fine to me. - You don't feel the way I'm feeling, it's like some of this isn't even here. Just, I'm like seeing everything in the wrong time. Oh I feel hot, I feel hot, hot. - You are hot. - I don't like this anymore. - Come on just relax. That's it, just take it all in. - It's like being swept up, like the way it's pulling me. - Oh yeah, let it take you. - I'm like turning like part of this clock. Hold on, I don't feel it yet. No, I'm still part of something. - You're gonna be fine, just lay back. - I've been here before. - Yeah, you have. Yeah you have. - Wait, stop it's not over yet. - Oh that's it baby, I want you to feel this. - Do it Morgan, do it, lose it, explode, explode. Let it slip, let it all slip, it's real easy, feel gone, show how it's done. - Stop, wait. Is this the present? - Morgan. Stop it's fine. - Get off. - Morgan, you're gonna be fine. - No! - Just calm down, you're gonna be okay. - Get the fuck off me. You knew exactly what the fuck you were doing in there. - I didn't know you were gonna freak out like that. - I'm not talking about the Salvia, fucktard. I'm talking about you and how you always take shit too far. - Well look you're the one who wanted to try it, so don't blame this on me. - You still don't understand what the fuck I'm talking about, do you. - I guess I don't. - In a nutshell genius, you just took advantage of me and I don't fucking play like that. - Come on Morgan, we've done way worse then that, and you never said shit about it before. - Maybe I'm just tired of getting my arse chewed out because of you. - Because of me? - Yeah dingus, it's your fault I'm on house arrest, remember it's because of you I can't leave this dungeon. - You can keep blaming me all you want, but I'm tired of listening to it. - Of course you are, couldn't give less of a shit about how badly my life is fucked right now. - Oh how is your life fucked? - How is my life fucked? Let's count the ways, my dad took away my Lexus, my tablet, my phone, my music, basically everything that makes me me. - Well what the hell do you want me to do about that? - I want you to stop dragging me into shit, and coming over here thinking you're gonna get something out of it. - I never dragged you into shit. - What did I say to you when you first got here tonight? I told you you weren't getting any, and that's exactly what the fuck I meant. If you can't just hang out and be cool, then maybe we shouldn't hang out at all. - Jesus, what did you have some kind of like religious experience or something? - No, I'm just not gonna be your fucking whore anymore. - You know this aint like you Morgan. I don't know what it was I did to piss you off so bad. But maybe it would be best for the both of us if I left, is that really what you want? - Look, if you're gonna leave, would you at least put the ladder back by the pool house where you found it. - Fucking dyke. Fucking shit. Robbie. Robbie. - Hello. - Robbie. - Who's there? - Robbie come here. Robbie get in here. I've got something to show you. I have so much to show you Robbie. That's it, that's it Robbie, come closer. Yes, closer. Yes Robbie, closer. - Hello. What are you trying to do to me? Who is this? - You, it's you you little sow. It's you I want to be fucked too, not him. Make fuck to me right now. Listen to him die slow, loud. - Stop. Please stop calling me. Please. - I can almost smell you now. I'm so close, close to you. - Hey honey. - Daddy. What time are you coming home? - In a little while, why? - Morgan, sweetie what's wrong? A guy keeps calling and saying all this horrible stuff. I don't know if it's somebody that I know that's just messing with me. I just don't even know what to do, I'm so fucking scared. I don't even know why I'm calling you, I just feel like I'm losing my mind. - Honey it's fine, just calm down alright. What kind of stuff is this guy saying to you? - He's making all these sounds, and doing weird things to himself. - Sweetheart listen, if anyone is calling and harassing you like that it's mostly likely that boyfriend of yours. - Daddy you're not listening to me. - Honey, I hear you loud and clear, but you need to listen to me. That Robbie is up to no good and I wouldn't put anything past him. Now I saw some of the text messages he sent to your phone and I couldn't believe some of the stuff I read. - You went through my phone? - That's right and it's a good thing I did. I finally found out what kind of boy my daughter associates with so that I can put a stop to it. And don't think I didn't see all those dirty pictures you two sent to each other either. - Daddy you had no right to do that. - I had every right to do that young lady, I'm the one who pays that phone bill, remember. So if some pervert keeps calling you, being inappropriate Morgan it's probably him. - It's not Robbie daddy, I know for a fact that it's not. - Well what the hell else am I supposed to believe after what I saw. Just seeing the two of you together like that honey, I'm still in a state of shock. Shit. - For God sake David, what is it? - It's nothing. Just don't have a very good feeling right now. - About what? - About Morgan. - What are you trying to say? - I'm saying I think we need to go back. - Go back, David are you out of your mind, what about our tickets? - We can go to the opera another night alright. - Listen to what you're saying, we drove all the way out here and you just want to turn around and go back. David, let's no go back, let's not. - I have to check on Morgan Brynn, I can't just let go. God you don't understand. - I understand that this infatuation with your daughter is becoming extremely unhealthy, that's what I understand. - Look we're going back and that's all there is to it alright. I don't care what you have to say. - Grandma. I'm coming in. I have your medicine. Grandma did you hear me? I have your pills. Grandma? - Quiet, get in here, they're gonna come after us. - Let go of me. - Shut it you little shit, they'll find you and they'll swallow me and you too. - Grandma let go of my leg. - I'm gonna bite you if you don't join me in this child, now get your skinny arse in here. The bastard death rats they come and they go. All over the walls they crawl, inside, the rotten insides they always hide. - What are you talking about? - You've got to keep them out and fight, if you don't you become. I've seen things chewing on me, I felt it, and I felt it. - Grandma please. - Where are you going? - Your pills are by the door. - No one leaves heathen, you can't. You stay put, don't you join the fold by shutting your eyes. You must keep them open, you must. - Grandma stop. - Look at me, just see what you make me do. - Grandma stop, stop doing this to yourself. - Come to me, you just come to me. You'll come back to me soon dear, I know you will. You always do and then I'm gonna keep you wrapped up in here with me in the flesh forever. I want you to smell it like I do. Smell what it's like to rot, you'll find out. You'll find out. - Morgan, Morgan it's Barry. - Who? - Barry. - I don't know a Barry. - Yes you do, Barry Cone, I'm a close colleague of your fathers. - What do you want? - Look I know it's late but I really need to talk to your dad, it's very important. - He's busy right now. - Yeah I know he's still at the Opera with Brynn, I talked to him just a couple of hours ago. - So what are you doing here? - I was told to be here as soon as he got back. I guess I'm just early. - Don't you drive a black Mercedes? - Yes, yes that's right, see you know me. - I just didn't see it parked out front. - That's because that German piece of shit just up and died on me about two miles up the road. I had to walk through this rain. It just quit. - So you need a tow truck or something? Do you not have a phone? - No, no, no, that's taken care of. I was really just hoping I could wait here for him. - So you decided to hike all the way up here in this mess? Are you crazy? - Would you believe I ask myself that a lot lately. No, if I'd have known that it was gonna rain like this I would have stayed with the car I promise. - Yeah, sucks for you. - Like you have no idea. Listen sweetie can I just come inside for just one second, I just need to dry off. This rain is really cold. - How did you know the code to get through the gate? - I don't know the gate code, the gate's open. Morgan, I can promise you that gate was wide open when I got here. I don't have any reason to lie about that. Look I know it's late, and I know you don't know me that well and that this probably sounds like a whole bunch of crap to you, and it's good that you're thinking that way. - Then you can understand why I can't let you in here. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah I suppose I can understand why you'd feel that way. Listen, I'm gonna go ahead and go, and I'm sorry I scared you Morgan okay. Have a good night. - Hey. You're gonna drown out there. - Thank you. Oh man I'm getting the floor all wet. - It's fine, I was gonna go get some towels anyway. - I'm really sorry about dropping in on your like this. Must have scared the crap out of you huh? - It's fine, been jumpy all night anyway, the storm isn't really helping. - Well, I mean it's gotta be scary right, big house like this, all by yourself. - Yeah, I mean usually I don't mind thunderstorms. - Well, that's a hell of a storm right. - Yeah. - Uh, your dad doesn't still have some of that really good brandy back there anymore does he? - Um, I guess so. - Well I don't mean to impose, but I could really use a stiff drink after being out in that shit. What do you say kid, join me for a stiff drink? - I don't know, my dad always gets on me when I sneak that shit from the bar. He can always tell. - I won't tell anybody if you won't. - David this is Barry, I'm at the house, so I will see you in just a few minutes, thanks. He has got to still be at the opera. Alright, post time come on. - You do I'm underage right. - I know you drink Morgan, I used to watch you all the time at your fathers cocktail parties when you were like 15. - You watched me. - Yeah you used to always sneak in and steal all those wine coolers that nobody else wanted. - Guess I wasn't sneaky about it. Can I get some ice or something for this? - You gotta be kidding me, that's no way to drink brandy come on now. - I know how to drink brandy. - Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a pro here. I always thought it was cute how you used to always dip into our punch bowl too. - You thought I was cute. - Yeah. - You sure used to watch me an awful lot didn't you. - Yeah. I mean, never in a weird way. Just I was just perceptive. - Yeah, sure. - You were a cute little thing back then too. - Whatever, back then I was a pudgy little hose bag, who wore way too much eyeliner. - Nuh uh, I don't think that. I don't think that at all. Get you another drink before your dad gets home. - Do you like get off on encouraging minors or something? - Would you believe you're the third one this week. - I know one thing, I'm not gonna be wasted when my dad gets here, that's the last thing I need. - What are you doing? - You have another shirt I can borrow? - I mean I'm sure my dad does, but that's upstairs and fuck that shit. - If any of this is making you uncomfortable in any way just let me know. Come on Morgan, we're just two people having a casual conversation over a harmless little drink. - It's been a while since I've had brandy. I should probably pace myself. Nonsense, you're only young once. Come on kiddo, toss it back rookie, you know what to do. Dip into the punch bowl Morgan. That a girl. - You know, speaking of dipping into the punch bowl, wasn't it you that used to screw around with Brynn? - What do you mean screw around? - Seems like I can remember seeing you two at the same type of parties you guys would see me. You guys would always sneak around and make out and shit, the same way I would sneak those wine coolers. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - Yeah, yeah and my dad would always be really busy with clients and I can remember you two getting pretty friendly with each other now that I think about it. - You got some wild imagination kid, that's all I can say. - You know, I don't even know if my dad knew about that. I bet you didn't even know that I knew. - Morgan, what you're saying right now has got to be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. What in Gods name makes you think I've been getting frisky with your fathers girlfriend? - Because I watched you two. Not in like a weird way or anything, I was just being perceptive. Come on Barry, we're just two people having a casual conversation over a harmless little drink right. Seriously dude you can be honest with me, I don't give a shit, that's y'alls business. I do have to admit that's typical Brynn for you though. Tell me everything you know about that shady bitch. I'm just curious, dip into the punchbowl Barry. How's that for a punch bowl? Fucking cunt. Wake up sweet girl. - Oh my God, what the fuck. What the fuck are you doing? - I'm getting things ready. - Getting things ready for what? - When your daddy gets home. - It was you, wasn't it? - It was me what? - You who kept calling me. - I don't know what the fuck you're talking about Morgan. Don't cry baby. - I don't know what this is about, but I'm sure I can work something out with you okay. - Sorry sweetie, see you're not in any position to help me out at all. Quite frankly, you're a sitting duck. - Just let me go. I don't know what the fuck you want from me. - This aint about what I want from you. This is about what you're gonna do for me. - Do you know what this is Morgan? This is a little something I like to call income tax. - What is that, what does it do? - Oh it's just gonna make you feel really good, and by the time it's done doing what it's supposed too you won't know what hit you. And I'm gonna be making love to you the second you die. And you're last breaths gonna go into me and you'll be mine forever. - You're not sticking me with that thing. - This aint the only thing I'm sticking you with. Besides I gotta make it look for real when your dad comes walking through that door, don't I. - What the hell are you talking about? - No offense, but given the number of times you've been into and out of rehab I don't think walking through that door and finding you dead in this chair, with this sticking out of your arms gonna be too big of a shocker if you catch what I'm saying. - Just let me fucking go. You're not gonna get away with this. - When you let me in that door, I kind of got away with it. I've planned this out to perfection. - If this is about money I know I can talk to my dad as soon as he gets home okay. - I can't do that, because I've gotta be done with you and out of here before your dad even leaves that opera. - Barry listen, I know you don't want to do this. - Morgan, I'm getting paid a lot of money to do this. But I need you to understand something, even if I weren't I really, really want to do this. What I want to do right now is suck on that fucking tongue of yours. Have you ever kissed a man before? Have you ever kissed a man before? That's really fucking good because if you don't do that this next time I'm gonna put this needle in your God dam eyes. You got that? Is there any part of that you don't understand? - No. - I've always loved you. Ever since you were a little girl. It's almost a shame I've gotta do what I've gotta do. - You don't have to, you can just listen. We can work something out okay. - As much as I'd love to work something out with you, I've got business to attend too. - Look, no we can talk about this. - We've wasted enough time. - I have to go pee, if you'll just let me out of this chair. - You can piss yourself for all I care. - Look, I'll let you watch me while I go, just let me go to the bathroom please? - What did you say to me? - I said you can watch me go if you want. I know you like me, I know for a fact you think I'm pretty. - Aren't you a naughty girl. - Just let me go to the bathroom okay. Just let me go to the bathroom and I'll pee for you. - Let's do this bitch. Nice. Oh fuck. God you're fucking hot. - Yeah. - You want this don't you. You want me to give it to you don't yah? God damn right you do. Call me daddy. I said call me daddy little girl. - Yes daddy. - Take off your shirt, let's see what you got. Fuck, spread your legs. I said spread your fucking legs little girl. Oh shit, oh fuck. I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you. Take off your bra. - Uh uh - I said take off your fucking bra. Oh mother fucker. - David, are you sure you want to go inside right away? - What do you mean? - I can do all of those things you know, all those kinky things you like. There's plenty of room in here. - Brynn please I have a splitting headache, I'm not in the mood right now. - Well at least just give us a kiss. Just one kiss. Dad. - What the hell? - Oh my lord. - Morgan where are your clothes? Hey, I'm talking here young lady, look at me. Why in God's name are you half naked right now? He's here, isn't he, that fucking Robbie is in there, and that's what the hell you've been up to. - It's not Robbie, it's Barry. Barry Cone just tried to murder me. - Barry Cone, Morgan, what are you talking about? - He's in the bathroom, I can show you. - Show me what exactly, that Barry Cone literally just tried to rape and murder me, and that this duplicitous bitch was in on it. - Morgan you're being delusional. - Fuck you and everybody that looks like you Brynn. You haven't liked me from the start. - That is not true. - Bull shit you're trying to get me out of the picture, so you can get half of my dads money. I know you. - Morgan. - That is ridiculous. - I know what's up you British piece of shit, I'm on to you. - Alright, stop this now I want you to can it with that shit and apologize to Brynn right now. - I'm not apologizing to her. She's been plotting against me. - Honestly David, her behavior is unconscionable. - Sweetheart, what are you on right now? - I wish the fuck I was on something, just come with me to the bathroom and I'll show you daddy, I'm not crazy. - Morgan, Morgan is this what you wanted to show me. You've been doing coke in my house again? You haven't learned one God damn thing yet have you? - What? - I swear to God, he was right here on the floor, so were my clothes. - And just what the hell were your clothes doing in the middle of the bathroom floor in the first place missy? - He made me take them off, and he tried to take his off too, and that's when I cut him and ran. - You cut him and ran. That's it, that's it, you're going back to rehab and that's final. I swear I cannot trust you to be by yourself alone in this house for five minutes. - Daddy you're not listening to me, he was here in the house, he's still here. - Who's still in the house, Robbie? - No it's not Robbie. - Robbie if you can hear me, God damn it you little asshole I want you out of my house right fucking now. - Daddy, it's Barry. That's what I've been trying to tell you, did he not call you? - Sweetheart, nobody has called me alright. He probably called her phone, seeing as how she and him set this whole fucking thing up. - Okay darling, you're not making sense of any of this. - Don't give me that shit. You've been fucking Barry Cone, I know you have. - I haven't a clue what you're talking about. - How much were you paying him Brynn? What was hit cut gonna be? - His cut? - Alright, alright, quiet, the both of you. Cover up for God sake. - Daddy he's still in here, I know that he is. - That's enough. Look I need to have a word with Brynn in private, and I want you to go up to your room and wait for me, I'll deal with you in a minute. - I'm not going up there, would you just listen to me for once. - For once just do what I told you, go to your room. - No. - Listen girly you're already in a lot of trouble with me. I don't think you want me to start adding to your list of problems. Alright, what was she talking about in there? - Do you honestly think I have the slightest clue. - Well tell me why did she just say you were fucking Barry Cone. - Oh come on, surely you don't believe a word of that. - At this point I don't know what to believe Brynn. I don't know what's real and what isn't. - Look David, your daughter needs serious professional help. She's always attempting to sabotage our relationship. - We're not talking about Morgan right now alright. We're talking about you and Barry Cone. - There's absolutely nothing to talk about. - Is there not, are you sure about that? - David I'm positive, why on Earth would I got to bed with Barry? - Come on Brynn, I've seen you flirt with him plenty of times and you have slept around on me before. - Yes but not with one of your colleagues of 15 years, that's preposterous, and for your information you've slept around on me in the past just as many times, if not more. - That's not the issue right now, the issue is you and Barry Cone and how my daughter seemed to know every nook and cranny about it. - I hate to break it to you David, but the only thing your daughter knows is whatever she believes to be true. She's a spoiled little brat, who lives in her own feeble mind. In her own little made up fantasy world. - Stop changing the subject Brynn, did you or did you not fuck Barry Cone. - Stop grilling me, I do not want to answer that question. - Why, because it's true? - No because it's absurd As many stories as your daughter's fabricated about me you actually believe I'm fooling around on you. - I pray to God you're not Brynn. Because if I find out you've been cheating on me with him of all people, you're not gonna like how I react to it. - What is that supposed to mean? - Just what I said sweetie, it better not be true. - Or what David? Suppose you found out it were true. What would you do? Would you ground me like you did your daughter? Would you punish me like a naughty little girl? Would you spank me like you do her David? - Is it true? - That's it David, do it again but much, much harder this time. That's what I want, I love it David. - Stop playing games Brynn, God damn it, did you fuck Barry? Tell me you didn't. - God damn it. Hit me with a fucking tennis racket. - I'll break your fucking neck. Ah fuck! You fuck. You're gonna keep fucking quiet. How's this for you champ? You really fucked me up you know that? Fuck that bitch you quit. First I'm gonna play a little bit. How about I get that same piece of glass you stuck in me and fuck you in the arse with it. Maybe a little finger job to start off with. - Get your fingers out of my you fucking pervert. - If any of this is making you uncomfortable in any way just let me know. - Right now. - Just take it off. - Daddy! - Morgan we need to get help, fast. Well don't just stand there, help me. We need to call the police. - Oh God. - Why are you looking at me like that? - What did you do? - What you don't think I did this? Morgan, you must listen to me. Morgan wait! Fuck! Morgan, Morgan where are you. Morgan darling tell me where you are. Morgan I can't help you unless you tell me where you are. Morgan! Morgan? Morgan darling, are you in here? Where are you Morgan? Morgan, tell me where you are! Morgan! Make it easy on your poor old stepmother. Bitch! - You aint my stepmother bitch. Shit. - Morgan baby. I think you hurt my head real bad, I'm dizzy. I need a doctor. You little sow, I can smell you down here. You naughty little bitch. Open the fucking door, I'll murder you like I did you mother. - What are you talking about? - I guess the cats out of the bag now isn't it. - What did you do to my mother? - Let's just say I managed to slip a little something in her wine glass. Your mother was always so drunk and pathetic, making it look like she drowned, that was the easy part. - You fucking bitch. - You're quite right sweetie, I am a fucking bitch. When someone stands in my way I get rid of them fast. - Please, why are you doing this? - It's about money honey, pure and simple. The kind of money that's kept you in diamond nipple rings and silk panties your whole life. - Fuck you, I fucking hate you. - Of course you do, you have from the very start. You remind me of my own rotten daughter, she's a spoilt ungrateful little shit just like you. Now open this fucking door. Bitch! Bloody little brat. Morgan, you can't get away, I'm right behind you. Fuck. Oh Morgie, Morgie darling. You wouldn't happen to be going to your grandma's would you? You're making this too easy on me Morgan. Fucking foot. Morgan, you can't hide from me forever. I know everything about this house. Inside and out. You might as well just come on out. What the fuck are you looking at you cunt. - Hey. - You're finished whore, say hello to your mother. - Say hello to my grandmother. - Get her off me, she's mad. Get the hell of me, I'll kill you. - The harlot, the harlot is gone. - Grandma. Something's wrong. I don't feel right. I can't breath. - My body feels like an impostor, my head is a void. Mother, love me. What the fuck is this? Grandma? You in here? Shit. - What is going on here? Oh my God, what the fuck! You can't leave me stuck in here. Please, open the door. God damn it, let me the fuck out of here. Open the fucking door. Please. Please, please be forever.
