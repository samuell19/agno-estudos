I do, Shepherd. Oh, my Shepherd. I need you. Come, and help me. I need a deeper experience with you than I have ever had before. Come down upon me, and fill me with yourself. Help me be closer to you. Thank you, Shepherd, for allowing us to be your wives. Thank you for your grace and love. Thank you for your grace and love. Thank you for a beautiful day. Thank you for a beautiful day. Thank you. Thank you. Have we truly stripped ourselves from the knowledge that keeps us from the grace of Eden? - Yes, Shepherd. - Yes, Shepherd. - Yes Shepherd? - Yes, Shepherd. Do we seek that experience? We seek a profound experience.. Have we cleansed ourselves from the rot of the outside world? Yes, Shepherd. - Have we? - Yes, my Shepherd. My wives. You all came to me.. ...broken.. ...searching.. ...hurt by a cruel world that is more filled with pain every day. I took every one of you in. I protected you. I sacrificed my life for you. I gave you shelter I gave you daughters and sisterhood.. ...and life. Let us pray. And reflect on our blessings. Oh, my Shepherd, we seek a profound experience. Oh, my Shepherd, come down upon me and fill me with yourself.. Oh, my Shepherd.. Tamar, should you see if Maria needs help? Of course. See you later, Selah. Did you like my sermon, Selah? I'm glad. I can always tell when my sermons are boring for your gaze wanders up amongst the trees. My Shepherd, no, your sermons are always wonderful. I'm only teasing. I know you listen most ardently. So beautiful. Just like your mother. Can you tell me the story of when you first saw her again? So beautiful. Can you tell me the story again? When you first saw her? Make sure one of the wives re-braids your hair. He looked at me. And then.. I mean.. I'd never felt anything like that before. Shepherd just said "Shall I hold you?" That's how it is being a wife. It is like healing, sisters. And he just kept telling me "You are perfect" and "You are accepted." And then he held me there in his arms. In that moment, everything was perfect and I knew I never wanted to leave. "You are perfect" "You are accepted." You only just came here. Selah! You can't. She's a wife. She's the same age as us, though. You're not allowed to speak to a wife like that. I'll tell on you. Sheep-shit you will! Sisters. Stop! Mommy! Selah hit me. Selah. Have you anything to say? She started being mean to Eloise even though she's a wife and Shepherd says we're not meant to be mean.. Tattle-tale. - What was that, Selah? - Nothing. If you two sisters cannot work together then I suppose I'm gonna have to separate you. Selah, take the leftovers out to the hut please. What are you doing, you stupid child? Give it to me. The offerings are rich today I see. You know the food is meant as penance. To help purify. She won't eat. She's fasting. She thinks the bleeding is punishment for Eve's sin. She's right, the Shepherd says so. You think that because you haven't had your time yet that makes you special. He tells you that. But it will come soon enough. Prepare yourself, child. Our great Shepherd won't be so sweet on you then. If you are impure, is it not right to drive out the rot? So pious and perfect. Just like your mother was. Don't touch me! You are unclean. You can leave now, little one. I'll be seeing you when the blood comes to you. Get out. Okay. Come on, girls. Shh-shh-shh. Come on. Time for bed. Come on, Lily. Come on, come up here. But, mama, I'm not tired. I know, but you have to go to sleep now, Lily. You know the rules. But I want a story. Stories can only be told about the flock and the shepherd. And only the shepherd is allowed to tell them. Okay? You know that. You don't wanna get Selah in trouble now, do you? - No. - I'm sorry, Selah. - Okay. - It's okay, Lily. I know you didn't mean it. Okay. So mama's gotta go, okay? But Selah's gonna stay with you and then you're gonna go to sleep. Shepherd, the lambs will be coming soon. That was your last food and drink. We mustn't contaminate the newborn lambs with impurities. You are too young for such a responsibility. But if the Shepherd wills it. You have witnessed a birth of one of your sisters before? It's like that. When the ewe is ready, she lays down in the birthing position ready to help the lamb arrive. It's the most natural thing in the world, Selah. And the most sacred duty. The Shepherd is trusting you greatly. Selah? What happened with the lambs? The wives wouldn't tell me anything. Just that you were with the Shepherd. Selah, what happened? I fell asleep. A wild dog got one of the lambs. Killed it. Selah? And when the wives found out, they went and got Shepherd and Maria took me to the church. Shh. Shh. He forgave me. But it is worse than punishment. I didn't believe hard enough in the flock, in the Shepherd. I was impure. You're gonna have to leave. If I don't, will you arrest me? You've got a few days. My precious flock. I have grievous news. To protect us all, we must leave. Otherwise, the outside world will destroy us and take you all away from me.

He said it was punishment.. ...for my vanity. He said the same when he cut my hair. Now he calls me a broken thing. I don't believe you. You look so much like your mother when you say that. What was she like? She was beautiful, of course. We joined the flock at the same time. We were the first to be given his grace. His attention is like the sun. It's bright and glorious at first. But then it just.. ...burns. I don't know why you would say that. Of course you don't. Not yet. I was jealous of your mother at first. You must have been glad when she died then. Having me.

I've been here for so long. I don't even know who I am anymore. You were away for so long. My bleed was only short the first time. And with the cursed-wife, what does she speak of? She doesn't say much. It's her penance. Shepherd says it's to atone for her sin. Well, it must be, if the Shepherd says so. Sorry you had to leave us. She's a broken thing. Is it time? No, no, it can't be time. It can be not. It's too soon. It's too soon. I can't do this here. Breathe! Breathe. - I can't do this here. - Breathe. I can't do this here. Please. No. I can't.

He wanted to leave the baby. He said it should be with its mother's ashes. The baby? But I thought it was born wrong. He's perfect. It's a boy? Only one ram in a flock, child. You are so strong. Promise me you'll remember that. And help your sisters to remember too. Shepherd, are we nearly there? I think I see something... that way. Tamar... would you like to lead us? No, Shepherd. I just.. Walk. Walk. - Ah! - Walk! Get up and show us! Walk! Tamar, walk, walk! Go. Please. Walk! Pathetic. You can't be mine. We must have faith. He shouldn't have done that to you. My dear faithful flock! As a reward for your faith in me I give you paradise on earth. Eden. You must release yourself, your earthly worries and trust in me to hold you, to save you to give you my grace. You must release yourself, your earthly worries and trust in me to hold you, to save you to give you my grace. I feel different. Mother, your hair is so beautiful. Would you like some? No thank you, Tamar. We are fasting. Tomorrow, we wives will be reborn. This is Eden. It has to be. Selah. Come. Don't go, Selah. Don't go. Unbraid your hair. Come here. You're so beautiful. Just like your mother. Lie down. I remember when I first saw your mother. Shh. Goodnight, my sweet Selah. I'm going to tell you a story. Selah, only the Shepherd can tell the stories. There once was a woman. A wild woman. Made of moonlight and teeth. And sometimes, she would roam in the woods searching for something. Hunting. And the wind, and the trees and the water would speak to her. Talk to her and tell her tales. Tell her where to go. Tell her to be free. Sisters.. ...the wives are gone. There has been a miracle. The sacred lake of rebirth has given the wives the grace of eternal life. They found the way back home. Where's my mother? Where's my mother? Where's my mother? Daughters, this was the path I had to take.. ...for you sisters to become the wives. Selah. My sweet Selah. My beautiful Selah. My wife. Come here. I will take you in my arms, Selah and I will give you my grace. Come here. I'll give you my grace. You are not our shepherd. I don't want your grace.
