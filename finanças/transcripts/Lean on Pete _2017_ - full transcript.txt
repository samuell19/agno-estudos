Does that make you hungry? No. Meet me out back, all right? Just meet me out back. Hello? Hi. Hi. You must be Charley. - Nice to meet you. - Lynn. Nice to meet you. You want some breakfast? Sure. Yeah. Where'd you get the food? Well, I made your dad go to the grocery store 'cause all you had in the fridge was beer and Cap'n Crunch, which I'm betting was yours. So? Well, you don't need to keep cereal in the refrigerator. Oh, well, we got roaches. One of them got in the last box I left out. Determined little fuckers, huh? Uh... is it OK if I get a glass of water? Yeah, of course. It's your house, isn't it? Charley, did you take my fucking belt again? - No! - Then we must have been robbed. Never mind, it's here. Ah, yeah. Well... - You meet Lynn? - Yeah, we met. Met her at work. She's a secretary. Front office. Hm? Go ahead, have a seat. It's almost ready. How far did you run today, kiddo? I found a horse track. It's just around here. - Have you seen it? - I've driven past it. - We should go sometime. - Uh-huh. - All right, here you go. - Ooh! - Thank you. - Thank you. - Mm. - Good? - Delicious. - Yeah? All right, it's that time. I'm gonna get ready. Ooh. Is she your new girlfriend? Is she gonna be? I don't know. Why? Do you wanna fuck her? I like her better than Marlene. Marlene was smart for a stripper. Marlene was mean. And she couldn't cook like this either. Yeah. Lynn and I just work together, you know? - Plus she's married. - Really? Well, she's separated, but her husband's a Samoan. So he'll probably cut my head off with a machete. - What's a Samoan? - Big motherfuckers, that's what. They play football. Is he gonna be mad? Ah... She said he moved in with some other woman, so who knows? Is he gonna come here? Hell, Charley, I'm just talking. Plus, he doesn't know where we live. So don't worry about it. Hm? OK. What did you do last night? Um... I just watched TV. Yeah? Watched TV? Anything good on? No, nothing. All right, let's get a move on, we're gonna be late. See you around, Charley. Oh, thanks for breakfast. You're a really good cook. Anytime. You gonna be OK on your own today? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah? Here. Oh, thanks, Dad. Sorry I can't give you more. Don't worry about it. This is... I don't need any more. Don't wait up, OK? Hear that? He likes your cooking. He said you're a good cook. Thanks, Gary. Hah! Hah! Come on! hah! Ah, you motherfucking, cock-sucking fuck! Hey, what are you doing? Me? Yeah, there's no one else here. - I was just running. - Are you strong? - I don't know. - Come here. You know what time it is? It's about seven. Right, I gotta load two horses, and get to Wenatchee by one, and I got a fucking flat, all right? My hand is killing me. How about... How about you get those lug nuts off, I'll give you ten bucks? Come on, ten bucks. Yeah, keep going, keep going. Keep going. I'm Del, by the way. I'm Charley. - What's in... - Wenatchee? A race. - A horse race? - Well, yeah, a horse race. What do you think goes in this trailer, dogs? Hey, would you need help? - Help with what? - With anything. - How old are you? - I'm 16. - You know much about horses? - Not really. Would your folks be OK with you spending the night away? 'Cause I can't drive there and back in a day. - Where would we be staying? - I'm just gonna sleep in the truck. You can sleep wherever you want, I don't care. You have a sleeping bag? Yeah, would we have time to go and get it? - Where do you live? - Delta Park. Yeah, let's go get it. Hey, how much would you be paying me? $25. Take it or leave it. OK. I'll take it. All right. Get in. Come on, let's go. Gotta get these damn horses loaded. - Those boots feel OK? Are they too big? - No, these are great. You don't want to lose your fucking toes with the shoes you were wearing. How many horses live in here? Well, when the races start, there could be up to 50 in a row, and there's about 25 rows, so it's over 1,000 horses. - How many of them are yours? - Shit, I used to have... ...20 or so. Now I got about six. All right, this is Tumbling Through. Be careful. He's a biter, all right? If he goes for you, just smack him on the nose, he'll quit. Just take him out there, and wait for me, all right? - Straight down there? - Straight down there. Take him, just go. Come on, you lazy piece of crap. Come on. Don't give me any of your shit today. Don't let him stop on you. If he tries to stop, just give him a quick pull. If he pulls away from you, just give him a harder pull. Never let go of the rope. If you let go of it, he'll fucking run on you. Come on. Come on. Come on. What are you doing? Don't wrap the rope around your hand! That's a good fucking way to lose your hand. Here, let's switch. This one's a pussy. Just wait. Come on. Come on. - What's this one's name? - Lean On Pete. Get in. How old are the two horses? Tumbling Through is two. He's green but he can run. Lean On Pete is five. He's a piece of shit, but he's good enough for this. - You know what a quarter horse is? - No. Quarter horse is a breed. In racing, they're sprinters, anything from 100 to 400 yards. The tracks don't give a shit about quarter horses any more. Maybe Los Alamitos, but... ...you won't see me again in California. Why not? In this one? Yes, go ahead, come on. Do you know how to drive? Yeah. You sure? I don't want you messing up my truck. My dad has a van. He lets me drive it sometimes. - Yeah, but this one's tricky. - I'll be fine. All right. Take the truck, park it around over there. I want you to clean the shit out of the trailer. There's a broom and a shovel in the bed of the truck. Then come back here and find me, all right? - OK. - I'm gonna go race Tumbling Through. Shut that gate. You better not fucking lose today. You know what happens if you do. Don't run. Walk. Hyah! Come on! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! And they're off! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Where's Tumbling Through? Did he win? He bowed a tendon so I sold him. I got enough fucked-up horses as it is. Who did you sell him to? He's going to Mexico. Hold that. - Is he in a lot of pain? - It's not my problem any more. - What is that stuff? - Stay here. It's just vitamins. Come here. Come here. Get in there. Good boy. Good boy. What kind of vitamins? What did I tell you about too many questions? Zip that up and put it in the truck. You gonna fucking win today, huh? It's up to you. It's up to you. All right? Come on. Open the gate. Come on. What? I mean, he was gonna put me on nine to five. - Is this your first race? - Yeah. Don't blink. It's over in, like, two seconds. Come on, you... Come on! What the fuck? Come on. Come on! Go! Did you see how fast he was going? He ain't fast. If he hadn't beat that slug, I would've slit his throat. Pete ain't fast, the other horse is just a pig. Listen... ...I want you to walk him down that road, and cool him off. Then we gotta get the hell out of here before those fuckers get drunk and want their money back. Come on. Hey, come on. All right. There you go. This is a 50. I know. You did good today. Let's get Pete and put him in the paddock. Hey, Pete. How you doing? Where you been? I left a note. I got a job. What kind of job? Working for this guy named Del at the horse track. And that's who you went off with? Yeah. We went up to this ranch in Washington for a race. Where did you sleep? On the bed of his truck. I got $50. - 50 bucks? - Yeah. And this guy seems all right? I guess. I mean, he paid me. I got more food. He get you those fancy boots too? Oh, these are just so I don't break my toes. Well, aren't you a piece of work? You know, I was a cook for two years once I dropped out of school. Yeah, I know. It's no way to live, though. Getting up at four every morning. Getting hit by grease all day. People complaining, orders backing up. It's no way to live. Yeah, but you get free food? Yeah, you get free food. But let me tell you, you end up hating food. But there are waitresses. Hm. You like waitresses, don't you? Yeah, I guess. The best women... have all been waitresses at some point. So, what have you learned? - Don't be a cook. - Huh. And... ...go out with waitresses. Boom. Besides being a hotshot athlete and getting a job... you're smart too. No, not over your neck. Drape the rope over your shoulder. Good, all right. Come on. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Hey, hey. - Slow down. - Remember what I told you yesterday? Yep. Hook him up before you take the rope off 'cause he'll run on you. Good. See that, Bob? This kid's a natural. Yeah. He's a good kid. And he ain't afraid of a hard day's work like some of these other kids. - Come on, Pete, it's all right. - Just relax your arm. You're walking. I know. I know. You're just excited. - You did real good. - Come on, Pete. You got it. Just happy. There you go, keep moving, keep moving. Stay ahead of him. - Yeah, yeah. - You singing a song? - There you go, hon. - Thanks. Put it on my tab, Cindie. Mm. Jeez, you don't have any manners, do you? What did I do wrong? You just wolfed down half a sandwich before I even started. You don't just shovel food in your mouth like it's... You're not a pig, are you? No. Then let yourself chew. I don't know how you get it down without choking. You gotta chew your food. What does your mom say? I don't know. I don't know her. Well, does your dad have any manners? I don't know. I guess I haven't really noticed. Did your mom leave you or something? Yeah. And she never showed up again? No. That's something you don't hear about too often, a mom leaving her kid. She must have been a real piece. - You don't have a stepmom? - More coffee? - Uh... no. - Thanks. That's a shame. A kid needs a mother. There's my Aunt Margy. Yeah? Do you see her? No, not really. Her and my dad got in a big fight and they don't speak any more. Fight about what? Me, I guess. Yeah, what did you do wrong? Nothing. I was just 12... and my dad went away for a few days with some girl, and Aunt Margy found out and she got pretty mad. She wanted me to live with her instead. But you didn't? No. Charley, look, if we're gonna be eating together, you gotta get some manners. But don't be asking me, OK? 'Cause I don't have time to teach you everything, all right? All right. I'm gonna go home. That's it for today. You can take off too. There's your pay. Why is this less than last week? I just bought you lunch, didn't I? And I'm letting you go home early. Open the fucking door! Calm down, buddy! I didn't do fucking nothing! I heard what you two did tonight! - Dad, what's going on? - Charley, get the fuck back in your room. Come in. Come in. Calm down. Calm down. Maybe I can help. You wanna talk about it? I'll get you a beer. We should have a beer together. Just stop. Sshh. Fuck you. - Dad! - Urgh! Stop it. Charley! - Urgh! - Glass smashes. You OK? You OK? OK. OK. Call 911! It's gonna be OK. OK, I'm gonna be right back. OK. OK. Call 911, please! My dad is really hurt! It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, no, no. - Where are they taking him? - To Samaritan. - Is he gonna be OK? - Why don't we get out of the road? - Can you tell us what happened tonight? - I don't know. I was just asleep and this guy started beating on the door and he broke the lock. - Do you know his name? - No. But my dad was seeing this lady and she was married to this Samoan. - And what's her name? - Uh... Lynn. - I don't know her last name. - How old are you? I'm 15. Do you have someone to look after you tonight? My aunt's coming. Are you sure? Yeah, she's on her way right now. All right. Wait here a minute. We'll be right back. We should call Family Services. Yeah, no problem. I'll see you on the other side. So your dad just got out of surgery. So he's gonna look a little bit messed up. The glass actually ended up cutting his bowel, so it seeped an infection into his gut. - Is that serious? - Yes. It's very serious. It's like he's been poisoned. OK, I'm gonna leave you two alone. Just try not too much talking. Your dad needs to rest. Hey. Does it hurt? No. They got me pretty doped up. You're gonna be OK. I hope so. Yeah. Do you think he's gonna come back? No. He won't be back. Big fucker. Yeah. - He's the biggest guy I've ever seen. - Yeah. I'm sorry... ...that he threw you through the door like that. Hey... ...I'm gonna be fine. - You should go home. Get some sleep. - No. I'm gonna stay right here, OK? I'm not gonna be much company. I'm gonna stay right here. - It's OK. - Yeah. I'm gonna stay right here. OK. OK. Hey, Dad. Do you think you could give me the number for Aunt Margy? Why? Well, just so I could call her. I mean... maybe she could help, right now. We can take care of ourselves. You and me, we don't need anyone's help. No, I know. But... with you being here... and me being back home... You know what you need to do? You need to go home, get a good night's sleep. You're the only one working. We need that money. I ain't gonna get shit being laid up. So it's up to you. OK. Hey, buddy. It's just me. I'm gonna be staying next door for a little while until Dad gets better. Promise not to tell Del. You know he wouldn't like it much. It's gonna be fun 'cause I'm gonna get to come visit you a lot more. No, I understand but can you tell him I'll be away for the night, - but that I'll be back tomorrow? - Sure, I'll tell him. - Now, you promise you'll tell him that? - Yes, I promise I'll tell him. - He's doing fine. - OK. - Don't worry. - Thank you very much. Charley, hurry the fuck up! You too. Thank you. There she is. Move over. Get in the front. Hey. - This is Charley. - Charley, I'm Bonnie. Are you a jockey? No, she's too fat to be a real jockey. I just lost seven pounds. - I'm down to 122. - Yeah? I swear to God, get a fucking scale right now. Yeah, OK. So what do you like to do, Charley, when Del here isn't making you do all his dirty work? - I run. I play football. - At school? Yeah, but not yet. I played in Spokane. I was on the freshman team. We won eight games in a row. What position? Corner. And sometimes wide receiver. But I'm too little to play anything else. I'm waiting to lift weights until I stop growing. I haven't grown in six months, so... maybe soon. Why did you move to Portland? - My dad moved here for work. - What's he do? Can we not talk? I ain't talking to you. I'm talking to the kid. I was tired of talking to you 15 minutes after I met you 20 years ago. That's a good one. I just tell it like I see it. Is it hard being a girl jockey? It isn't easy, that's for sure. I used to work out horses up at the track for a couple of trainers. They always promised me rides. And then when it came time, never called my name. So I just had to wait around for the horses no one else wanted to ride. Did you ever get hurt? Yeah, once at a race in Union, which is way out in eastern Oregon. I was in the gate, this horse reared up, flipped over backwards, and I couldn't get out. He landed on me. - What happened? - Broke my pelvis, punctured a lung. My mom was there. She saw me on the ground, screaming out in pain. All she said was, "You're not too hurt to run in the seventh, are you?" Got a job at the Red Lobster after that. I like that place. I went to the one in Spokane with my dad for my 13th birthday. But then I went back. And that's what happens. I started riding for this guy that made Del look like a good guy. I mean, a real pervert. He liked to watch girls taking a piss. Then there was another horse that spooked. Threw me into the rail, and I broke my back. - Shit. - It was worse for the horse. Broke both his forelegs; something I'd hardly ever seen before. Hey, what can I get you? - Uh... elephant ear. - All righty. And then what? Then I met Del. He lets me ride. - Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you. Sometimes I think I might quit. There's only so many times you can fall down, right? You could go back to Red Lobster. That I could. Ain't that Rooster something? Hope you had a couple of bucks on Rooster. - Hey, Bonnie. - What? I heard someone down by the track saying that Del runs his horses into the ground. You think he'll do that with Pete? Well, it's true. If Del's broke, he'll run his horses every two weeks. Sometimes even once a week. And is he broke? He's broke a lot more than he used to be. We haven't done the fair circuit in a long while. We're here now, so... Don't worry about Pete. He's a quarter horse, so he's got that going for him. And he's probably been laid up for a while. Listen, you can't get attached to the horse. Why not? 'Cause you can't think of them as pets. They're here to race and nothing else. If they lose too much, they get fired. Just the way it is. Come on, let's get going. This race is a quarter-horse event. Just a 200-yard dash down the straightaway. Don't blink or you might miss it. Here's Bonnie Durand riding No.1, Lean On Pete. Come on, Pete. Lean On Pete into gate one on the inside. Let's go, let's go. And they are all in the start gate. - Come on, Ray! - Let's go! Oh. OK. Faster, Pete! Go, go! But it's all Lean On Pete. Lean On Pete and Bonnie Durand winning with ease. - We won! - Yeah. Did you see? Bonnie Durand had Lean On Pete ready in the starting gate and he just took off like a rocket! - He won, right? - Yes. Here. - Did you get rid of it? - Yep. Looks like Rodriguez is gonna send out a search party. Don't worry about it. Is he OK? Yeah, he just ran faster than he should have. What are the tests for? They test the winner for drugs. Did Del give him something? - Is that why he ran fast? - No. Keep your voice down. What did you tell him you got rid of? A buzzer. - What's that? - Don't worry, they won't find it. - Yeah, but what is that? - Just gives the horse a little shock. What kind of shock? Hi. We good? Let's get the fuck out of here. - See you, Richie! - All right. Man, that Rodriguez is one suspicious son of a bitch. Oh, I wonder why. Don't worry, he's fine. So what do you think about all this, Charley? What do you mean? You know, working the backside... surrounded by horse shit. Being here in the asshole of nowhere. I like working the horses. And we need the money, so... Hey, you should do something else... before there's nothing else you can do. Shit, I used to like horses too, you know. Now sometimes I feel like I wanna punch myself in the face if I ever see a horse again. Got the good stuff. I'm OK. I think I'm gonna make a phone call, if that's all right. Yeah, why don't you go get something to eat too? - I know you must be hungry. - I just don't have any money. Well, shit, I could pay you right now. Are you sure? Hey, any day I make more than I spend on these goddamn horses is a good day, in my book. Bon appétit. Thanks. All right. See you guys later. - Can you wake him? - No, he needs sleep. - All right, but he got my note? - Yes, I told him. - OK. Yeah, as long as he got that. - OK, Charley. Thank you. Operator. Hi, I'm looking for a number. - For Margy Thompson. - Which county? Yeah, no, she lives in Rock Springs, Wyoming. I'm sorry, there's no listing for her. - There's no one at all? - No. - Maybe if you check under Margaret. - OK. Can you check that? Yeah, I'm sorry, nothing's coming up. OK. Never mind. - Here you are, sweetheart. - Oh, I didn't order that. - It's on the house. - Thank you very much. He don't look that bad yet. Looks like he's walking on nails to me. You don't think he's navicular, do you? I don't know. I don't think so. We'll see how he goes down at Grants Pass. You think he'll be rested enough by then? He's gonna have to be. I'm not wasting my good horses down there. Tell you one thing, if I had a gun, I'd probably shoot him right now. But he just won. And you raced him too hard. Listen, kid, things are changing. The race meet starts soon and we're gonna have a lot to do, so we can't fuck around, you got that? Let's load up and get back. Like I said, Charley, he's not a pet. He's just a horse. Charley! - Hey, where's my dad? - Hey. We tried calling you at the house. - Where have you been? - Has he gone home? Listen, come with me. Where the hell is he? Um... why don't you grab a seat in his room over here? OK. - Is he with you? - I'm gonna be right back. Just give me a minute. Charley... I'm really sorry, but he didn't make it. What do you mean, he didn't make it? OK, so, that cut that was in his bowel, there was one that didn't show up on the X-ray, and so that became septic. And then his organs... - I don't understand. - I'm really sorry. Listen, he wasn't in any pain. He was asleep when it happened. You said he was OK two days ago. OK, I need you to give me a number. - I wouldn't have gone if he wasn't OK. - Charley, listen. - Do you have someone I can call? - You said he was asleep. Did he get my note, or was he asleep? I'm sorry, Charley, but I need to call someone for you. - Just give me a number. - There is nobody. OK. OK. Well, we can figure this out. I'm gonna go talk to Family Services. You stay here. I'm gonna get a phone. Charley! Charley! Leave me alone! The race is on. A good start for Easy Gamer down towards the inside... It's a photo finish. Might have been Easy Gamer. Well, folks, that does close out the show for the exhibition-day races. But don't forget, opening day is coming up tomorrow and it's gonna be one heck of a day. First post time is at 11:00am, and races going throughout the day. We can't wait to see you for opening day at Portland Downs. Tomorrow's a big day. I know your foot's been hurting and I know you lost at Grants Pass, but it's gonna be OK. I'm gonna talk to Bonnie. I'll get her to ride you. I know she'll help us. Here we are. Here. You want one? There you go. You gotta try and win tomorrow. OK? You hear me? You gotta try and win. Hey, Bonnie. Hey, Charley. Long time no see. Del put Pete in the claiming race. - I saw. - You need to ride him. I can't, Charlie. It's already decided, it's printed. I'm riding Mr. High Pockets in the same race. Yeah, but maybe they could swap them. - Or you can persuade Del. - No. Mr. High Pockets is Del's best horse, I have to ride him. Plus I need a win. Yeah, but Pete's never gonna win if you don't ride him. I hate to say it, but I don't think there's much chance of him winning even if I was riding. If he doesn't win, then he's not gonna get claimed. And if he doesn't get claimed, then he's gonna go down to Mexico. - Isn't he? - Charley... They don't slaughter horses here, but I know they do down there. I'm right, aren't I? If his feet are fucked, then they're fucked. So they're just gonna kill him... just 'cause his feet are fucked? Like I said before, if a racehorse isn't fast, then he's no good as a racehorse. This is the end of the line. There's no lower tracks. It's just the way it is. Come inside, I'll get you a soda. I mean, back in the '80s it was, right? But now people don't give a shit. They just want to sit in front of their goddamn computer. Right. Or else they go to the fucking mall like that's a big day out. Jeez. Buy designer jeans or something. Longacres. That was a real track, right? - Remember that place, Bonnie? - Sure. Longacres. That's where your mom, rest in peace, she won her first race. By the way, your mother was a decent jock for a woman. You think you can persuade him not to race Pete today? But even in the '90s, it was still kind of all right. And you could trust the jocks. Not like now. The jocks are all backstabbers. No offence. I know your daughter's a jock too. - Want a Coke? - Yeah, sure. Didn't you used to go out with Dale Evans? That was a time. Gotta just do your best today, OK? Here's No.6, Lean On Pete, for trainer Del Montgomery. Pete's a five-year-old and he's had a decent year so far running on the fair circuit. He won over at Burns but came fourth down at Grants Pass. Tonight he's being ridden by jockey José Alfaro. In the No.5 slot is Mr. High Pockets. He'll be ridden by jockey Bonnie Durand. Del Montgomery also trains this runner. An interesting long shot could be More Money Honey. She's 14 to 1 right now. All right, just win the fucking race, Bonnie. ...getting set to come onto the track for the next race. So, folks, just a couple of minutes to post time as the horses make their way forward to the starting gate. Heavy favourite right now... Excessive Jubilation. You've still got a few minutes left to make your wagers. More Money Honey will be next. Mr. High Pockets and Bonnie Durand in gate five. And finally Lean On Pete. They're in the gate. - Come on, Bonnie. - The race is on. Get him out front. Brilliant start for Mr. High Pockets who goes right out to the front. Mr. Rare Tidal Wave in second spot, Excessive Jubilation in third. With 100 yards to go, it's all Mr. High Pockets. Excessive Jubilation finished up in third. Lean On Pete finished last. So, folks, that does close out the show for live racing here at Portland Downs. We thank you for joining us tonight. Please drive home safely. Good night, everyone. Bonnie. You see me win? I won twice. Fucking twice! - I'm gonna buy you a beer, OK? - I want us to buy Pete. You can ride him and I can take care of him. Yeah, let's do it! No, I'm being serious. I'm sure you are. Charley. Get over here. I need you to pick up the truck. Why? Hook up the small trailer, we gotta load Pete in tonight. Where's he going? I'm selling him. I'll buy him. With what money? And where are you gonna keep him? Not in my stalls. I don't want him going to Mexico. He's a good horse. Oh. Go get the fucking truck. What the fuck are you waiting for? Now! Charley, you don't want that beer? Don't worry, it's OK. Del's selling Pete. He told me to load him up and park in the lot. Sign here. Thanks. What can I get for you? Um... I'd like a 27, regular, please. Sure thing, honey. Hey, what are you looking for? You better not be eating anything. I mean it. You need a minute? Um... I don't think so. Uh... could I get the chicken-fried steak dinner with baked potato and soup and a large Coke? And um... could I have two cheeseburgers to go? You're hungry. Oh, shit. - Take your time. - Thank you. Hey. You forgot to pay for that, huh? Get off of me. - No, I'm not. - I don't have any money. You don't have any money? What a surprise! Yeah, put me onto the sheriff. This is Mitch, down at the Apple Peddler. Whoa. No. You sit down. What's your name? Huh? Yeah, hello? Yeah. - Yeah, we got a dine-and-dash here. - Do you want the sheriff? Yeah, I want him down here now. - Bus just showed up. - OK. - How many? - 20 or so. Driver wants to talk to you. You don't let him leave. Stealing from a waitress is pretty low. I'm sorry. I was just hungry and I spent all my money on gas. Where are you headed? - Wyoming. - Why? My aunt used to live there and I'm trying to find her. Maybe the sheriff can help you find her. - I can't go with the sheriff. - Why? Because I can't. There's 28 of them. They all want food. I don't know what to do. I'm not gonna leave him alone in the office but we only got 45 minutes before those people are on a bus back to Winnemucca. I shouldn't say this but just let him go. What? Are you kidding me? You saw how much food he ordered? Just let him go. Fuck. Come on. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh, not right now. Fuck. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Don't worry. Don't worry. It's gonna be OK. Sshh. Pete, hey, OK. Sshh, sshh, sshh, sshh, sshh. It's OK. Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry, it's OK. It's OK, it's just a car. Don't worry, you're fine. Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey! It's OK. Hey! It's OK. Come on. Sshh, sshh, sshh. It's OK. You're OK, Pete. It's OK. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on, Pete. It's OK. Hey, hey, hey. All right, good boy. Good boy. Sshh, sshh, sshh, sshh, sshh. Hey, hey, hey. I was just thinking about uh... my friend back in Spokane. He was called Colin and he was a line-backer. He used to invite me over to his house which was pretty cool. First time I went over there... Well, see, he had three sisters and we were all sitting by the kitchen table. On this big kitchen table. They just ate breakfast. And they just laughed and talked and... They liked each other. Hey. His mother was there too, and she had this bathrobe and she... ...she would make pancakes, and, Pete, I love pancakes. It was the nicest place I've ever seen. I thought about calling Colin and his family... ...after what happened... ...with Dad, but I didn't. I thought about calling a bunch of people from Spokane too. The truth is, I don't mind telling you this... ...I didn't wanna beg for anything. And I didn't... I didn't want them to know what I was living like. If they ever thought of me, I'd rather them think of me as being OK: playing football or... hanging out with Dad. I'd rather them never see me again than see me like this. Me and Margy, we used to go camping all the time whenever my dad needed time to himself. There was this one time, we just sat around a fire, and there was no one around. Just the trees and the mountains. We counted the stars, and we tried to name them. And then eventually, the uh... Eventually, the fire, it started going out. And so we started to lie down and get ready for bed. Eventually, we were lying down, and we were both kinda scared. And that's when Margy sat up and she said... "Is it all right if we just left? It's getting spooky and I'm just kinda scared and..." I was young, so I said, "I am too." And we went back to her house. And we just stayed up watching TV all night. And we camped there the rest of the weekend... ...just watching TV. I think that... ...I think that she must have a nice house. If we went, as long as we behaved ourselves, she'd let us stay too. I think so. Here you go. Oh, fuck me. Are you all right, kid? You look awful. My truck broke down on the highway. - How did you get all the way out here? - I walked. You should not be walking in the fucking desert. My horse needs water. Mind if I get some? - Who's that? - It's a kid with a... horse. - What kind of horse? - He's a racehorse. - Like a racehorse, racehorse? - Yeah. No shit. - What's the horse's name? - Pete. That ain't much of a name for a horse. There's a phone on the microwave in there if you wanna call somebody about your truck. Dude, that's my controller. - Man, I was racing. - I bet you were. That what you call it? - I was racing! - You call it racing? What do you call it? I thought you were just twiddling with your little fiddle over there. See, this is why they don't let you drive over there. The line's busy. - Where were you taking the horse to? - Wyoming. - Why? - Supposed to drop him off. You're in a world of shit, then, aren't you? Yeah, I guess. You can use my phone until you find someone. I'm Mike, that there is Dallas. Friendly fire. - I'm Charley. - Drink some fucking water, Charley. I don't need you dying in my kitchen. - All right, man. - Are you gonna fucking die? - Hey. - Whoa! All right! Get up. Get up. Ha, ha, ha! Stubborn fucker, this guy. Maybe he just doesn't wanna be ridden. Of course he does, kid. He's a horse. Hyah! Come on. Let's go. Hey, be careful of his foot! Foot's fine, kid. - Let's go. - You gonna get on him next? I've never ridden a horse before. Really? Well, Mike will teach you what to do. - I don't want to. - Why not? He's just not for riding. Not by me, at least. Sloppy Joes have arrived! Sloppy Joes! Sloppy Joes are here. - Hey, who is that? - That's Mr. Kendall. Oh, hey, and Laurie too. Good boy. - There you go, Pete! - Come on, Charley! So what's it like being back? I'm not sure. You boys... you done us a good service over there. Well, we done something all right. We had a buddy who lost both his legs... and got a concussion so bad he couldn't talk any more. Another one had to shoot a guy. Said the head just blew off. Body just stood there for a while before it fell to the ground. Tell him about the girl. We saw this truck get blown up. This girl, she just got blown in half. Like, cut in two. Split right here. That was seriously fucked up. Yep. But you gotta do what you gotta do. Right? Food's ready! That's us. Let's eat. - What about you, kid? - What about me? Are you gonna join the army like these boys, serve your country? I guess I hadn't really thought about it. Laurie, get me another beer. - You boys want another beer? - I'm good. Jesus Christ, if that girl gets any bigger, she's not gonna get up the stairs. I had to put a shower in downstairs... 'cause she couldn't get in the fucking tub. Last week, I caught her eating a whole goddamn bag of Snickers in her room. - You know that's not true. - A whole goddamn bag. It is so true. You get so ugly when you drink, Grandpa. You wanna see ugly? You really wanna see ugly? You're lucky you got someone looking after you, Mr. Kendall. Yeah. You're probably right. Mm-hm. You want me to help dry? If you want. I like your belt. It's my dad's. I like the pictures. Every time he'd go somewhere for more than six months, he'd get something added to it. From the looks of it, he must have moved around a lot. Yeah, I guess. Thanks. Can I ask you a question? Why do you let him treat you like that? I don't have anywhere else to go. And... when you don't have anywhere else to go... you're kinda stuck. You want some ice cream? I think Mike's got some in the freezer. I'm sure he wouldn't mind. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Get in the goddamn car. Thank you for dinner. You get her number, Charley? Lost your chance. Operator. Hi, could you connect me to Rock Springs, Wyoming? It's a bar. It's called Scottish Sam's, I think. - One moment, please. - Thank you. Please hold. Scottish Sam's. - Hi, I'm looking for Margy Thompson. - Who? Yeah, I think she worked there a few years back. Maybe longer. Sorry, she doesn't work here. Would anyone else know? Uh... Dwaine might know. All right. When will Dwaine be in? He'll be back in a couple of days. - Yeah. Could I get your phone number? - Yeah. It's 5-6-5... Just gotta keep going. This isn't our home, Pete, come on. This isn't our home. Gotta keep going. Come on. Come on. Come on. You're OK, you're OK. I used to have a picture of my mom. But I threw it away one night when I was mad. Her name was Nancy and she had real black hair and she was real tall. When I was born, I stayed with her, but then she left me with my dad for a week and never came back. He said he didn't know why she left. But, when I was little, I'd always ask about it. And he'd never say anything, but then, one night, when he was drunk... he told me that she was the moodiest person he's ever met. He said that she'd walk in the room, and he swears she was a different person. That she'd be mean one hour, and then nice the next. Sounds a bit like Del, if you ask me, right? And then he said to me... ..."Charley, I ain't gonna lie to you. She hasn't called or sent a card, but I know deep down she loves you. She's just fucked up in the head, and likes to party too much. I know it's hard to hear, but it's a good thing she's gone." Then he said to me... He said, "I ain't worth shit, but I like being here with you." It's OK. I'm gonna get us out of here, OK? I promise. Hey, it's OK. It's OK, don't worry. It's OK. It's just a car. Oh, it's motorcycles. Don't worry. Hey, you're OK, you're OK. Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey! Shit! Pete! Shit. Slow down, Pete! Come on! Hey. Hey! Pete! Watch out! Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. You're OK. Sshh, sshh. Sshh, sshh, sshh, sshh. You're OK. You're OK. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK. I promise, I promise. - Where's your family? - My family? - What's your name? - My name's Charley Thompson. OK, Charley, where did you used to live? Portland. I lived in Spokane before that. And Green River before that. - Fine. Where you heading? - Wyoming. What's in Wyoming? My Aunt Margy's in Wyoming. - So you're a runaway? - No. Well, OK, Charley, where are your parents? I don't have any parents. All right, listen. Everything's gonna be OK. We're gonna take you in, we're gonna get you cleaned up. We're gonna fix everything. But, just, please, tell me whose horse this is. Officer! Charley, why don't you wait in the truck? It's warm in there. What's wrong with you? Sure. - Yeah, I could have got it here. Hold on. - Are you kidding me? My dad never had a hold on me personally. Meet me out back, all right? Watch where you're fucking going. - Oh, come on! - Just got to get off that crap. Yeah, and the thing is that um... Ricard! Ricard, you got the rest of my stuff? This is all right. Yeah. Part of my life is... What's your name? Charley. Harley? Harley? Charley. When did you get into town? I haven't seen you here before. I'm Silver. How old are you? Can you not talk? I'm 18. I just got into town yesterday. Shit. Newbie. So where are you sleeping? - Colfax. - Fuck! Hey, that's no good. There's nothing but junkies around there. You'll get fucking raped and murdered off Colfax. I can look after myself. Yeah? All right, well, that's your choice. Utah. Idaho. Uh... Montana. We were in Montana. For, like, I don't know, six weeks. It was great. Wanted to go to Alaska, but I don't know if this thing will make it. Are you sure she won't mind me staying? Martha? Nah. She's got a brother she hasn't seen in a long time about your age. No worries. Hey, we got a guest. You can go ahead and put that there. Come on in, check it out. Charley, Martha. - Hey. - Martha, Charley. Go on. Fix this door. Hey, do you guys think I could get a job around here? I'd do anything. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of jobs... around here for homeless kids. I'm not homeless. Well, I hate to break it to you, but... ...that is exactly what you are. Anyway, there's no jobs around here. Ask the Mexicans. They're the only ones that seem to get jobs. See? She talks. Hey, could I borrow your phone? Sorry, man. Hey, would you guys mind if I borrowed your phone? I just need to make a quick phone call. All right. - Thank you so much. - Just one call? - Are you gonna stay right here? - Yeah, I'll stay right here. Just one phone call. Thank you so much. Yeah, this is Scottish Sam's. Hi, Dwaine? Is this Dwaine? This is Charley Thompson. I'm calling for Margy Thompson. I heard that you might know who she is. Well, sure, I know her. Well, I knew her. She ain't here, though. Do you know where she is? Yeah, she got married and moved to Laramie. Do you know who she got married to? A guy named Steve. He was a chemical salesman. She was working at the library there in Laramie. Do you know what library she works at? I don't know. There's probably just the one. - OK. Have a good day. - All right. Hi. What do you want? I heard you might be hiring. From who? From the Mexicans at the Mission. I'm looking for work. You ever paint houses before? We moved around a lot, my dad and I, and we painted... - How old are you? - I'm 16. - You ever been in jail? - No. - What's your name? - Del Montgomery. Everything OK? Yeah. Thanks. Check this out! Hey, Dad! Over here! You'll get more once you do a full week. Thanks. - Hey, is he OK? - No. No, he's... He's not good when he's drunk. So, if he doesn't pass out, you should leave, OK? - Want any help with anything? - No. Mm-mn. You sure? Yeah. - You OK? - Yeah. You cock-sucking little fuck! Thieving, good-for-nothing bitch! What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? - Get the fuck off me! - Drinking our water! Huh? - Eating our food! - Get off me, man! I want my fucking money! - I don't have any fucking money, man! - Bullshit! - I don't have any! - Bullshit! Hey! You got a job! I know you did! That means you got fucking money! I don't have any fucking money! I didn't get paid! - Martha, grab his fucking arms! - Get the fuck off of me, man! - Where's the money? - Leave him alone, please! Agh! - Give me your fucking leg. - Get the fuck off, man! I bet you hid it in your socks, little shit! - Get the fuck off of me. - Ahh! - Leave him alone! - You little fucking liar! - What are you gonna do? - Give me my money! Please stop! Get the fuck out. Give me my money! Give me my money! Get the hell out of here, Charley! Just get out! - Come on. - Fuck! Give me my fucking money back! Fuck! Come on! Give it back! What the fuck? - Argh! - No! Jesus Christ! You... Urgh... Fuck! Get out. Get out! - This is my fucking money. - Get the fuck out! I'm sorry. We want to invite all passengers to board for Laramie, Wyoming, from Platform 2. That's Platform 2 for Laramie, Wyoming. Thank you. Charley? What...? Ohh... Hey. Feeling any better? I don't know. I felt really guilty not keeping better contact with you and your dad after what happened between him and me. I'm sorry. I tried once. But... You tried? Yeah, of course I tried. You're my little Charley. Of course I tried. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Would it be all right to stay here for a little bit? As long as your husband says that's OK. I'm not letting you go anywhere. And there's no more husband. Not any more. You stay as long as you want. You and me. Can you eat some more pancakes? You used to have a really good appetite. - Yeah? - Is it OK if I come in? Yeah, Charley, come in. - Are you sure? - Yeah, come on in. OK. - Hey. - Hey. If you wanna kick me out in, like, a week or so, you can. I'm not gonna kick you out. No, but if you want to, I won't feel bad about it. I'll be OK. That's fair. But maybe if I do get to stay, then I can finish up my school here? You have to go to school, it's the law. Maybe I'd get to play football if I get back to school. Of course. And the other thing is, if I have to go to jail... do you think that I'd get to come back here? You're not going to jail. But if you did, yes. OK. You need to go to sleep. Get some rest. I get nightmares. About my dad. About... Pete, sometimes. Just that he's drowning, and that I can't save him. I just get really sad sometimes that I can't save him. It's OK, Charley. - I'm here now. - Mm-hm. And the nightmares... are gonna get better. They might not go away completely, but they're gonna get better... ...the more good times you have. And we're gonna have good times, Charley. Yeah. I promise. I just miss him a lot. I miss him so much. Sshh, sshh, sshh, sshh, sshh.
