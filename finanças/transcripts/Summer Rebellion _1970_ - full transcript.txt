Now that the recorder is rolling, could we, before shooting, ask you a few... - Sorry for being so familiar. - Oh, it's alright. ...ask you a question. How did your career start? It happened quite accidentally. I was walking down the street when someone discovered me and that's how it started. So, like with everyone. Did you even dream of ...? Of course as a little girl when you hear about this kind of a profession. So in a way little girls do. I have to ask you very simple questions people want to know. What is your favourite colour? I think it's red. Warm red. - Political? - No, not political. Just as a colour. I understand. Your favourite food? Well, I do love spaghetti, but I can't eat much of that. - Your profession demands. - Profession demands being slim. - Sorry for talking over you. - It's alright. Can you recommend, as most of our readers are women, a special hack for staying slim? Well, a hack I've used a lot is an egg a day with white wine and a lightly grilled steak. That's how you get slimmer. Eija Pokkinen, photo model. - But it... what? - Nothing, continue. I don't know. It feels like I'm not myself at all when I do this work. It's like... selling yourself piece by piece. And this other role, it sort of... it sort of eats me away piece by piece. GENTLE VIOLENCE And attached to this, a heating system with enhanced blower. Adjusts with a thermostat and works even when the motor is not running. I'm sorry, but now I have to ask you this bra question... - Yes? - ...as there's so much fuss around it. - Would you still agree to these kinds of sessions? Not a chance, this fuss was enough. - Our magazine is socially conscious and our readers would be interested if we raised a couple issues. Racial segregation? Do you agree? Well black power is all the rage in the modelling world as well. All the top models in Paris are black. I wouldn't object being black myself. Well wasn't that fun? But now we have to start. Susanna, come this way... We have agreed with the Picture Sisters that we would be striving for soft and natural, beautiful freshness. In contrast to these raw advertising photos we'll bring out the human in you. Well, girls. I'll call you later then. And I'll take this glass from you. Music on. We'll see when the human appears. OBJECTS DO NOT CRY. Veli, 17 y/o We're in Paris, the product is moving and that's how we sell. This one morning when Susanna had left for work there was this one bloke lying down when I came in. I told him: "Take a hike, there's the door." I had this fine gal in Jyväskylä once. But, well... It never amounted to anything. Are you alone? Unhappy? Are you rejected? Abandoned?

You were wonderful as always. - Did you clean up? - Me? Clean up? STRANGER IN ONE'S OWN COUNTRY USA OUT FROM VIETNAM Look, I'm sure it's her. POWER TO THE PEOPLE I absolutely think Eki should apply for the grant from the USA. Nuclear physicist like him has no chance in Finland. We're not building any atom bombs here. I'm going to give Eki this. It's about how to apply for a grant and such. - Oh my god, there's a guy over there. - Where? Couldn't you turn this way and talk with me? How are your parents doing? Are they dead already, or? Actually all the guys I've gone out with lately, they... They're all not that nice. Others smell so foreign. And they can't satisfy me anyway. Have some more. Let's binge and you can stay for the night. - You remember Veli? - Yes. He lives daytimes here, sleeps on this bed, uses the bedroom he's there with a bathrobe on and he eats all my food and he straightens everything to cover up all he's done. - That's a nice picture. - Which one? They're all discarded ones. Not selling enough. And no shadows left on the background. I'll be back soon. - Ah, Susanna, little darling. - Hello. - What you been up to? - Nothing much. - What's on the little heart of yours? - Well I was just passing by... - And you wanted to see me? - Yes. I was thinking. Yesterday we had the shoot with the five girls. Yes? Just a moment. Well, we talked with the girls afterwards, and especially Sinikka... Pekka! Heinonen is here, would you talk with him for a while? Good. Sinikka said she got three times more money from the same shoot. Oh, my darling, why didn't you come to me before the shoot? I didn't know. I would've if I had known. It's not like that. Just think about it.... And Raija for example. She started the same time with me. She attended the same shoots. And she earned much more than I. Oh my sweet darling, you see, Raija is a rarity. She's the kind of rarity we can only use three times a year. Take postage stamps for instance. If we have there the... hate to say an error, but... but you understand that rarities are much more valuable. Isn't it true? Let's see these photos for example that we took of all of you. There's Sinikka, there's Raija... These are body shots but you'll see from these that you'll have to keep yourself fit. We have many hundred models. 300 or 400 we could use. And now you were one in five already. You're not a useless gal by any means. You see, a photo model is like a flower. And flowers need constant care. Flowers are cared for by humans, but we need to care for ourselves. Pekka. What would you think if we made Susanna our spring girl? Yup. Let's do it. Okay, let's have some... Smoke some and blow and let's make it a bit sexier. A bit more sexier. Good, good, now this is sexy. Let's try that one again. Little more lips. I can't do it any more. Do you want anything?

A TRIP TO THE COUNTRYSIDE - Good day. - Good day and welcome. - How wonderful! - Why are these logs so scaly? It's machine cut to ensure a tight fit to keep it warm in winter. - A beautiful window. - An old local tradition. - Beautiful table. - Akin to the cabin atmosphere. What do you think people look for in this kind of cabin culture? Are those... Do the first generation urbanites long for the childhood memories amidst the trees? That, and also to find some cosiness away from the city hassle. To find again that sense of safety. That's right. Our company aims for the perfect technical result in design and for a cosy way to spend a summer, and... No-no-no, we're going home. We're going home now. ACTOR MELASNIEMI PRESENTS THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONSUMERIST SOCIETY Everything in our society is predetermined even though advertisements create an illusion of freedom of choice. Bulk manufacturing doesn't leave space for freedom. Ideals follow production. WHO OWNS When the system is big and complex enough, people forget it is privately owned and start to consider it as some kind of a republic. The consumerist organisation dictates the individual's life's content and direction. There can be no failed products. Rather let humans fail. You're taught to respect ownership. Even if you owned nothing. Just like everyone. Even though whole Finland is owned by a couple rich families. When Eki and I get married we move abroad. If we get bored living somewhere we move some place else. I get to work in places where I get to represent Finland. The only inventions that get made are those that make profit. And when the crop is harvested, bang. Bang. Bang! BANG! If we, for example, gaze at a star in the sky we can't be sure it even exists any more. It could just be the light coming down to the Earth. For instance, it takes 11 minutes for Sun's light to arrive. It could arrive billions of years from elsewhere. It shows if it's big enough of an explosion. Like the star in Bethlehem. And this way these solar systems and milky ways they explode and condense like our Sun. It's getting hotter, and hotter it gets to a critical point, and explodes and with it our solar system. And this way the whole system pulsates. Condenses and expands and... You wouldn't know if the whole Universe was like that. Do we explode too? We have time to live our life in peace. And so could even many mankinds. The whole space system... is actually quite sympathetic and secure. Whether we can manage all this space and time we have is another thing. The cause of all this fear might be because of this our societal system that is unsafe and uncomfortable. We keep up a wrong kind of view of humanity and people never realise their options. They can't know of anything. It's very deliberate from those that are in power. Who gain from this all. IN THE COUNTRYSIDE TOWN MANAGER MEHTÄLÄ The municipality of Hirvensalmi is located in South Savo region, in the Mikkeli province near the beautiful and clean watered Puulavesi lake. The Centre of Hirvensalmi is located on an isthmus between two lakes. The population is centred on both sides of the road siding the beautiful lake. On the south side of the lake is a nationally renown black alder alley. An excursion to Hirvensalmi is a real thing. Travellers to Hirvensalmi have from year to year realised it's great potential. The future of the municipality is based on tourism and pastime. In the light of this, a large scale Puula-plan has been devised. Its core is in planning... the whole municipality for travel and pastime. Coffee. THE CHURCH AND THE YOUTH We are planning on building a holiday village on a land shared by us, the municipality, and private parties. I suppose you're interested as you don't have places for summer vacations like villas or cottages like elder folk. - I have a car. Oh, right? - That I won't believe. - Well, they do... You use the situation for your advantage by feeding the holidayers your ideology. The very same ideology including this outdated and unjust society. Well I would respond that one could disagree greatly on the subject. You young people just exaggerate on these disagreements. Be as it may, we all live here in peace and everyone can see that. The church youth work, the sports club's work, schools, all. We all work together for a common goal. TEACHER TURPEINEN Just like you said, vicar, but there are varying opinions on Christianity. Well it may not be so varied, but my thoughts are, that we should recognise that Christianity actualises in the society. How, for example, a Hirvensalmi youth, a boy or a girl can really feel that they are living in a Christian society, where social justice comes true. ON THE VILLA Ahoy! Could we come there? - Huh? - Someone's yelling there. Nah, they're not yelling at us. - But they're waving this way. - Ahoy! - What's the problem? - Could we come there? - How did you get there? - The vicar brought us. - And blessed you unto there? - Yes! We can't get a tent up here. - There's room, just spread out. - There's only these damn rocks. The vicar should've known there's no place for a tent. - We have booze! - What? Booze! - Is this your own? - Oh, no... A master builder owns this, we're only renting. - Then I understand the wallpapers. - If we had the money, we wouldn't... My husband is in the press business selling ad space, and it means you have to change jobs sometimes. We can't settle down anywhere permanently. I'll put on the striped one, the light is so striped here. I'll take this off then, so Eki won't mix us up. How terrible, how is this, I've never... Just tie it there, not there, more up. - No, there's ants. - Climb up there, to the treetop. Hey, what're you doing now? We're putting up an antenna, if it's alright. - Why so? We're trying to get reception on Radio Peking. Peking... but you have a portable radio. You can't get reception on that. - You can if you ground it properly. - Ground? Could we set up a tent somewhere on the island? Well, for sure. There's enough room here. There you have a Finnish soldier. Fell from the sky. - Hey girls! - You wouldn't without... Come to the sauna and... Our Midsummer bonfire is a bit modest but can't make it bigger due to forest fire warning. Even though it's starting to rain. Hope people's Midsummer isn't ruined. This Midsummer time is a highlight event for the social life in this region. Damn, here comes the rain. And the Midsummer is ruined. We have such a custom here that all the weddings are arranged for the Midsummer. Some people even arrange their own funerals on Midsummer. CITY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY My name is Ville and I like liquor, pea soup, and Brilliantine. I beat all the yeah-yeah-lads, I'm oh so tough. Should we call for a greaser joint, those kind of guys I can't stand We would beat up right here and now. He is now in the hospital. SEARCHING FOR FINNISH HAPPINESS - Sorry, sorry. - Is it still burning? - It's burning. - Thanks. Let's put this back here. Like so. - Don't sit there, it's my seat. - Get lost. Susanna is looking well. Veli you sit there. - Food, food. - Soon we'll all have delicious steaks. Let it sizzle there. There's nothing better in the world than good food. And you. - Let's eat when it's possible. - What do you mean? Well there's two starving to one sated. I'm the other of the two starving. I need to lose weight. - Eki didn't mean that. - What then? He meant that it's peculiar that the world can't be organised so that we can't transfer excess food to where it's needed. It'd surely be possible, technically. But no one's giving nothing voluntarily. Not even if they had a bit too much. We wouldn't give up of this steak at the moment. - I would. - Come on. You're not part of this discussion. If some black Indian would knock on your shoulder eyes glimmering and ask for that steak, you'd never give it. You'd grab it with your both hands. The Indian? Well done, Susanna. Luckily everyone in our society that wants to work, can also eat. You well know that not everyone that wants to work have a chance to work. It's well known. I might add that my husband represents consumerist social democracy, and I'm more of a humanist. And I feel that the social... excuse me. God damn. That's what happens every time she starts to lecture. She gets mixed up in her cleverness, starts coughing and it's over. I just wanted to say the society's social equality should be carried out with a faster pace. So far we've managed to keep our differences outside of the marriage. - Fuck society, I want sex. - Same here, the sister's right. I want a home of my own.

It's not so dangerous. - We can start grilling soon. - What are you grilling? I have some fish inside. Hey the boat broke. Always peddling with other people's stuff. How is it broken then? - Oh, this. - This stick fell on it. I didn't have time to organise yet. It's only a railing. It's easy. You can glue it, right? It's iron though. Maybe it can be soldered.

Don't wake me up. Of course I'm being serious. GENTLE VIOLENCE You're not very wise. Forgive me. Veli! Crazy! I'll say it went off accidentally as I was cleaning it. It did go off accidentally! WHY The principle of owning generates violence. REBELLION 1 We want to own our close ones like a house, a room, a doormat. WHY Owning is violence. It erupts as violence. Private property and the exploitation of people are society's systemic violence. VIOLENCE OF THE SYSTEM It extends even to the closest relationships. OWNS The cruelness in society's ideals seeps in day by day. Moment by moment. Gentleness, owning, getting, losing... painful internal conflict that explodes into our eyes as violence. KNOWLEDGE REBELLION 2 STRANGER IN ONE'S OWN COUNTRY Consumerist fascism leaves no options. We are slowly starting to consider that kind of a life natural which doesn't have any natural ingredients. Knowledge of one's own place and possibilities is lost in the wordmongery of ostensible wellness. EXPLOITATION CONSUMERIST FASCISM REVOLUTION IN FASHION It feels like that everything that has been made should be torn down to begin anew. To see things clearly. In a new way. Of course it doesn't mean anything to others as they are ready to put up new advertisements to replace the old ones. But it matters to me. REBELLION 3 THERE IS NO RETURN Even the poor and penniless imagine finding happiness as a private entrepreneur. As a petty merchant of one's own physical or mental labour. Welfare society is a treacherous, misguiding word. It cannot cover up the violence in our financial system. A prerequisite for individual's happiness is born only when the society goes through a structural transformation. From within the financial structure. We need handshakes between the exploited. Western welfare state Sweden attracts us as an ideal. As strongly as Sweden exploits cheap Finnish workforce. Welfare is a dangerous illusion that is used by property owners and labour union betrayers to deceive us. This is the end of illusions. REBELLION 4 WORDS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR MEANING ...any other possibility than to be destroyed?
