I'm so hungry, Mommy. Well then you should've brought some food. You don't have anything? Stop, unless you want a slap. Stop fucking complaining. It's me. Hi, baby, where are you? When are you coming home? I'm runnin' out of eggs and Advil. My back's got me flopped. I'll be back before the food runs out. Don't worry, Mama. You in the woods? What ya huntin'? Did you find the letter, Mama? Can you read it to me? I ain't readin' it. I told you what it said. Can you read me the letter, please? The lawyer I sent is harassing your daddy for back payments. Your daddy don't like it, so the broke cheapskate's gonna come and kill me. He didn't say nothin' about me? No. Oh well, I need the return address. You don't need that. Yes, I do. Why you need it? I'll make it so you can sleep again at night. Yeah, how you gonna do that? I'm gonna make things right. What are you talkin' about? You don't know who you're dealing with. You ain't known him since you were six. You want to know him? Take a look at my broken back. You stay away from Colton. There's nothing good there. I love you, Mama. Man, I'd sure as hell hate to be the one you're gonna go see. Why don't you hop in? I can give you a ride. No, thanks. Then how 'bout, uh, offer you a little water? I-I-I'm not doin' nothin' wrong, okay. I'm just walkin' down a road. Well, I'm just drivin' down a road. Well- Sorry. It was just on the radio. This song was just on the radio. I wasn't really- But I like this song, hell. How do I find out where people live here? Do you mean the phonebook? A phonebook? The book over by the phone. So who are you lookin' for? You stay away from The Brothers if you plan on stickin' around. My private advice to you. What brothers? Where is she from? She can talk. Get her another. On me. I can buy my own. Who are you? Fuck off, Betty. I used to be pretty once. People used to buy me drinks too. Go to CW's if you want a free drink. You know CW? He ain't been around. Dodgin' you, like I am. Hey, hey, come on! Where's Root Road? CW James! Daddy? Mmmm. Daddy. What the- Who did this to you, huh? Who? I, I was gonna do this to you. Look at me. Look at me, Daddy! Look at me, huh! Because I'm all grown up, Daddy. Hello! Hello? Who wears this shit? Why doesn't my cell work? We're in the dark zone here. The towers all miss us. When does the sheriff's office open? The sheriff works strange hours. So then where do I find him? You mean the sheriff? You need the sheriff, your best chances are sitting right here. He's not here yet. Need some milk? That jacket lives on Root Road. You must be the daughter. You know about me? Go home. Yeah? He's dead. What? Who's dead? I'm in Golden, and I found him, but he's dead. Tell me it wasn't you. Someone tortured him I think. It just doesn't make sense, Mama, Me gettin' here and then somebody already done that to him. Didn't I tell you to stay away? You get out of there right now. Whoever done this is still there. I'm in town. It's not safe there either. You come straight home. I'm not comin' home Mama until I find out who did this. You don't owe him nothin'. You don't know that town. There's somethin' broken there. Yeah and I'm gonna find out what- Oh, don't you bother with that! Get home now! Okay, I'll get on the night bus. But when I come home can I read his letter? Just come home. He's an egg. I mean, it doesn't say that anywhere. Everyone knows he's an egg. Yeah, but how? It doesn't say that. Look, guy sits on a wall. Ah, has a great fall. All the horses, all the men can't put him together again. No mention of an egg. Why else would he crack open when he falls off the wall if he wasn't an egg? Why do you keep staring at me? Listen. I don't know why but I gotta tell you somethin'. I gotta kill- I gotta protect my daughter from the monsters, except I'm one of the monsters and so is her mama. I mean, you shoot her with eight dart guns, and she'll still come runnin' at ya. She got the drug endurance of a woolly mammoth. And she's the more fit parent. I mean, I think about my baby girl bein' with her mama or bein' with me, and it, it hits me. It hits me like- I mean, she's gonna get exactly what I had, a dumb dad and batshit mom and a town that just wants to swallow her unless I do the impossible and kill all the monsters. Then why are sittin' in a bar drinkin', feelin' sorry for yourself? Ain't that what you're doin'? Well, I don't have a little girl waitin' on me. Well you got all the answers there, don't you? Lookin' for answers. About what? If someone bad dies it's good, right? Someone died? Someone-someone close to you? Can I get you something? No, but you can get yourself another drink. Or you can be a man and get your daughter the hell outta here. To gettin' the hell out. What if it was a female egg? What if he's not an egg at all? What if he's just like some fool like CW, and The Brothers threw him off the wall, and he cracked open all over the floor and just cried? We're not so different. Why do you keep hounding me, lady? 'Cause you got your dad's eyes. So you knew my daddy? Knew? Got an extra t-shirt, if you need it. Hmm? All right. Oh, I'm all for the skin, but you better be careful around here like that. The men of this town would fuck the does if they could catch 'em. You know, apparently most of the whole town goes back to like two or three families. If you think about it, I mean, half these jerk offs are shackin' up with an aunt or an uncle and they don't even know it. There's a sick sense of love that goes through this town. That's my point. What's your name? Yeah, I don't like tellin' my name either. You know a face, a person, a soul. Shit, what do you need a name for? You're just like passin' through, on some kind of a hike or? You let me know if I'm over-talking, okay. I'm very aware of myself. You're over-talking. Oh, all right. Just gonna leave you be now. You know, I just wanna know other people I guess, you know, and I got a knack for words. My brother says it's obnoxious. You know, if talk is wrong, then I wouldn't wanna be right, because then I wouldn't be talkin' with your right now, would I? Or talkin' at you. If it wasn't for you starin' at me, I'd think you were a mannequin. Right? Yeah. I used to find mannequins sexy as a kid. Didn't say I was absent from the sick sense of love that goes through this town, did I? You are what you are. Ancestry, hmm, that's a good word. Do you know that word? No, oh, ancestry's like that creek out there. Okay, just because you're your own arm in the river, all your water still comes from that same big, fucked up chunk of ice, and do you know, that big fucked up chunk of ice is chasin' you? Did you know that? Oh yeah, really, really slowly but it is chasing you, and it will catch you, and you know it will, so the whole thing just feels stupid. What the hell are you even talkin' about, man? No, mm mm. I know you know what I'm talking about. It's written on you like a face tattoo. Running from the big fucked up chunk of ice. I don't think you have all your screws. Ah! What, you got like a thing for kindling? Can see why you have a knack for words? Why is that? Practice. You want some, um, rehydrated jerky? It's boiled just a baby bit, It comes out like steak. Hmm? You eat that? Yeah. You're a strange guy. Yeah, you like me. I can tell. What's with this hatchet? It was my daddy's. Hmm. Daddy's girl, huh? He taught me how to throw it when I was six. I stopped knowing him when I was six so. You any good at it? Oh shit. Shit! I won some competitions. I bet you did. Can I feel it? You can hold my knife. Ah, shit! Yeah. Well, that's- That's good. Yeah. Tight head. Perfect weight distribution. Any chance I get, I'm in the woods with my hatchet and my rod. I really wanna live out there one day, but I can't 'cause I gotta take care of my mama. Take care of Mama? Oh, you, yeah okay. I made you blush. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. Hey, can I, um, mm, can I shake your hand? I'm not asking for a kiss. You don't like how it feels, I give you full right just to chop it off. Daddy's girl. Ow, ow, ow, ow! Stop punching yourself! Stop punching yourself! Ah, huh, oh! No, no! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Oh shit! Huh? Still wanna fuck me? Even more. Hey. Drop it. But , he killed my daddy. Look, he's got my daddy's watch on, and Daddy's dead up at his house. He killed him. Well if that's so I'll-I'll make it right. You promise you'll make it right? Oh, you bet your ass I will. So she said, uh, you killed her daddy. Her daddy. Sweetheart, how well did you, uh, know your daddy? I see you're a smart girl. Let me introduce you to this dude here. He's my half-brother. My mom was prettier than his. My mom was beautiful. People around here like to call us The Brothers. And they call me the Charmer, because when I was 14- Why don't you just shut the fuck up, hm? Where are you guys taking me? Where do you think? To get the money. What money? The money your dad's got hidden on his property. What are you talkin' about? Daddy never had no dime. Well, you saw the letter, didn't ya? The letter that- The letter that Daddy wrote? That's the one. How do you know about the letter? It's no little coincidence that you come into town, just as word gets around that your old man's got some money hidden. Does your mama know you're here? How do you know my mama? How do you know about the letter? Hey! How do you know about the letter? Well, feel like a drive? I do feel like going for a drive. How do you two know about the letter, huh? Shit, I love your spirit! Hah, hah, hah, hah! I feel like a nice drive too. How do you know? Where are you guys taking me? Come on. Shit! Fuck! Now what the fuck am I gonna do with you? Well you are one crazy-ass gal, you know that? I kinda like you a little bit. You remind me of somebody, somebody familiar. I used to have a kid sister, just like you, wild. Yeah, real wild ass child. Poor thing, she didn't know how to- how to find the daylight. She just kept digging herself a- a deep dark hole she couldn't climb out of. Drank so much she fell out of the back of our pickup, nearly paralyzed her. What the fuck is this? Hey, stupid! Didn't I tell you to bury this? Yeah, I was gonna but I-I had to do laundry, so then I forgot all about it, so. Forgot all about it? Yeah. Just put the motherfucker in the ground. Yeah, yeah. Now, I got one question I wanna ask you. Where's your daddy's money? Did you try the bank first? When it gets all chilly like this, my hands get all swelled up and, I can't close my knuckles, you know. They lock up. My knuckles get swollen. Oh shit, I wanna play! Sweetheart, your daddy didn't believe in no banks. No, my daddy also had no money, 'cause he was a broke fuck! What the fuck are you doing here? Taking a vacation? Oh this is a real nice vacation town. If I told you you wouldn't believe me anyway. You know, this little thing here could do a lot of damage. To a pretty little thing like you. Where's your daddy's money? I know where it is! I know where the money is. Talk to me. It's- It's in the tub. Huh? It's underneath the bathtub. Under the tub? That's where it is. I said we should look under the tub. Well, go look under the fuckin' tub, brother. Well you go look. No, I wanna look. There ain't no reason that me and you can't get along. Ain't no reason why we can't be friends. We could work somethin' out. Hey. Honey. Mm. I can't move that. I can't move it at all. It's too heavy for me. Get that fuckin' thing outta here. Yeah, yeah, I'll cover it with something. Gotta protect her virgin eyes. This is a technique called sonar tapping. Blind people and dolphins do it to see things in the dark. Ah, god! Ah, that's good, I got it, okay. Ah! Ah! Ah, yeah! Fuck! Goddammit! No there's nothing here! She's got us on a goose chase. Shit. Shit. Oh! It doesn't make any sense. What the fuck happened to you? You mind if I warm up in here? Nicest room I got. What do you know about some money? Just rumours. How did these Brothers know about my family? Do you know where they live? Whatever you got going on with these guys, it ain't good. The Brothers and their family, they've been breaking this town for years. Well, we're broken. And there ain't a damn thing we can do about it. I have to know what's going on. The one time I knew what was going on, I lost my toes. That's The Brothers. Knowing and not knowing don't mean a damn thing. There's havin' toes and not havin' toes. Do you think you're making this place better with all that toeless, coward pussy talk? There ain't no makin' this place better. You're the nicest person that probably came through here ever, and you're waving a hatchet around, wanting to kill people. Bus is comin' through soon. You should be on it. Are you gonna tell me where they live? You know, it's a fine line between brave and stupid. It's a fine line between coward and smart. Last house on Black Lake Road. Beer for the road? I'll take two. I can't take money from a dead girl. Where you live isn't any different from here. All towns can't be like this one. No towns are like this one. I like your singing. How do you know my family? Never could get a one night stand. They always come back. Just kiddin'. That is why they call me the Charmer. Okay? 'Cause when I was 14, I got in trouble for seducing all my female teachers. Got sent to the principal's office. And the principal was a foxy female in the brink of menopause. Nine months later we had a beautiful baby girl. It's my superpower. And you and I are both helpless to it. And what's between us is bigger anyways. It's historical. What do you mean historic? We're like pit-bull litter-mates just finding each other years later, lickin' each other's faces, smellin' each other's asses. How did you meet my mama? Do you know that we have memory in our blood? Blood memory they call it. How do you know my family? Hmm? Answer me! How? Do you know what you need? What you need is a man. That's why you're behaving this way. I mean, you think that you need to be a fighter, but you just need a man to fight for you. Your daddy should've fought for you and he didn't. Well I would fight for you. Oh, I would stop at nothing to fight for you. You miss your daddy? I miss my mom too. Oh shit! What did you do? You piece of shit. Shhhh. So you're the other woman. What? There's only one man who was never ugly with me. But he was hung up on another woman. You. You ain't even makin' sense. Your daddy. What'd you know about my daddy? I know one thing about him. You were the only love of his life. Why would you say that? Yeah, yeah, right. I don't know why your daddy cared for you so much. I never had nothin' like that to care for. You don't know shit. You don't know nothin' about nothin'. You don't know nothin' about what daddy did to me, what he did to Mama. Kicked us to the curb when I was six. And kicked Mama's back so bad, she still can barely even walk. And Mama couldn't work, so she had to rely on all these different men to feed us, and these men, you- So you say Daddy loved me so much. If he loved me so much, then where the hell was he? I'm sorry that happened to you. Look, I don't know what happened between him and your mom, but you obviously don't know anything about what he did after. Damned fool driving over an hour to work, livin' on canned soup and six packs to save money for you, wanted to buy you out of the life you were in. "The Cycle" he called it. Nights and Sundays he's out lookin' for you. Writin' letters all over. Called every shit place that knows anything about anything. And no one knew a thing. Na uh, no, he sent that letter because he wanted to come back and hurt Mama. So I was gonna hurt him first. And that's why I came here to kill him. You came to kill him? Yeah. What? Why you think that's funny? It's perfect. Mission accomplished. What are you talkin' about? You killed your daddy and you don't even know it. Your daddy's love for you is what killed him. The money your daddy saved for you, that's what they killed him for. That's why your uncles killed him. My uncles? You're- you're sayin' Sheriff and fuckface are-are Daddy's brothers? They're your mom's brothers. Mama's brothers? You don't know much, huh? You're just- you're just talkin' out of your ass, lady. I-I-I-I've heard stories about Mama's brothers. And those bitches ain't them. Your daddy was a real fuck up but he would never hurt a lady. No, all he wanted was to do something nice for you. So this letter said Daddy wanted to give me a bunch of money? Really. I told him not to send that letter. Bullshit. Maybe it's all just bar talk. Maybe he never did hide any money. Nobody ever found it, right? Maybe you should just go home now. Forget all about what- What, why are you just fillin' my head with all these like lies, like Daddy savin' up money for me? Bullshit! And them being my uncles? They're my uncles? Yup. Bullshit. Bullshit! Betty, you home? Get in here. Get in here, go. Are you crazy? Trust me. Ow. Where'd she go, Betty? Bitch stole my knives and ran out the back. She knows where the money is. If the money's for her he'd hide it somewhere she knows. You need to get outta town now. Okay. Before you go, your daddy carried this around. I stole it a couple of weeks ago 'cause I was jealous. He drove himself crazy looking for it. Come on, Mama. Get away, I want Mommy. I'm trying to be a good dad, but you're making it really difficult. Mommy says you're shit. Leave me alone! Can you please just talk to me? Oh shit. I can hear your heart beating. You know, I know what you come from, girl. Just like you, I saw the face of my old man at the end too, the fear on his face. They always get theirs in the end. Then we're left behind. That's why you are what you are. I understand. I understand you gotta do what you gotta do. So what are you gonna do? Where ya goin'? You know, sweetheart, we aren't in control of a goddamned thing. It's the man upstairs. But I guess, uh, he ain't lookin' down on the two of us. Back when I had religion, and I was a preacher, I built that goddamn church with my own bare hands. I married your mommy and daddy there. It's when your momma was done with your daddy, she didn't want that church alive. With all this crazy shit, made up all these lies. It hurt my name, hurt my reputation. So where's the money, sweetheart? I swear. I really don't know where it is. You better find this goddamn money before your mama gets here. Why is Mama coming here? So you're my uncle? I'm sorry I missed all your birthdays. Ah! You are your mama's daughter. Come on, come on. Come on. Daddy. I'm sorry. What'd you do, baby? What'd you do, Mama? I see you found it. Where is it, Mama? Right there. Not the money, the letter, Mama. The one Daddy wrote for me, and not-not that bullshit fantasy letter that you made up in your head about him comin' down there and hurtin' you. The real one. The one about him looking for me. About this stack of cash he had hidden away for me. You know, the one you sent your darlin' old brothers out here to just pay him a visit. That letter, Mama. I want to read that letter. I left it at home. What really happened to your back? You know all about it. Your daddy kicked us to the curb and- The truth, Mama! He kicked me in the back! Oh, I know the truth! You fell out of the back of your brother's pickup truck, because you were a drunk, stupid little girl. You raised me on lies. My whole life is one big old thing of bullshit and so is Daddy's life! Now you shouldn't have done that to us, Mama. Us? You knew. So your daddy wanted to give you some money. So what? He should've been givin' me that money all these years, so I could buy you books and shit! Oh, you think it means he loves you, don't you? You don't know nothin' about nothin'. You're just a blind stupid girl who wants her daddy's love so bad she's willing to buy a bunch of horse shit. Who went without so you could have your Fruit Loops and your spaghetti and your fuckin' chicken thighs? Who took care of the boys who always threw rocks at you? Who visited you in juvie every week? Was it your daddy? He show up? It was your mama! But I gave my whole life to you. I gave you everything. And yet you love him more. Let's go home, baby. I don't care about the money. We can just split it. Go look at him, Mama. He's in the garage. I'd rather not. You're right about one thing. Oh, you are right about one thing. I have been a blind, stupid girl, Mama, Because you put all this together, didn't you, Mama, huh? And you knew my Daddy and your brothers would destroy each other, and then you could come over here and pick up all the money. Daddy's dead 'cause of you. You'd never hurt your mama. I just need to know one thing, Mama. Why'd you keep him from me for all these years, Mama? You're gonna kill me. Why should I tell you? Because I need to know, Mama! I need to know the truth, goddammit, please! Because he cheated on me. At least I thought he did. That's all? My family holds a grudge. Look at you. You're about to kill your mother. My parents have been dead for decades, but they're still fighting in my head. Your daddy and I are fighting in yours. No, you're not fighting in my head no more, Mama. I'll see you at home? I don't know, Daddy. I can't live here. And I can't go home either. Shots? No, I'm-I'm good. What are you having? Coffee. You know what your dad once said to me? The only real revenge is living a good life. I didn't listen to him. Campaign contributions. I, uh, I think there's an opening for a new sheriff. We can only afford one seat. She can sit on my lap. I took your crazy advice. You're probably gonna tell me I'm doin' it all wrong. This girl's gonna have her own bedroom, at least her own bed. Gonna work some shit job, I don't care. Just gotta get her away from here. You want one? I got an extra one for her. It's extra. Thank you.
