Now that's got some kick, Doc. This PPKS is a sweet little weapon. Don't pull so hard on the trigger. Your throwin' off your sites. All it takes is practice. 38 mm is too small. "Too small," she says. Well, what do you say, Doc. 300 000 dollars is a lot of money. I'm tellin' you straight. Sounds too easy. Oh, it is. All we gotta do is break his sorry ass out of jail and get him across El Rio Grande. What's the hard part. Collecting. Not this time. This here Mexican's Uncle is loaded. Help me out here a little bit. Tell Doc it's a good deal. We'll split the money, 50-50. You are kidding. I'm on this job too, you know. You got a smart woman there, Doc. You taught her real well. She knows we do most of the work, we get most of the cash. Well, I don't know about that. I'm supplying the plane and the deal. Without that you got nothin'. Which one you like, baby. I like the Colt. The Colt's mine. But I want it. Excuse me. I hate to break up this beautiful moment here, but I need to know what you're gonna do, Doc. Are you in or out. Guess I can take that as a yes, huh? I'll think about it. Don't take too goddamn long. I'll do it myself. Hey, man, where's my lawyer? Mendoza, come on out. Step up to the line. Turn around. 925, coming up on your right. Okay, I see you. Up here on the left. This is perfect. You got 3 minutes to pull this off. Once I get in the van, I know. Right. What? Hell of a way to make a living, Doc. You should have married a dentist. MAN Follow me. Hey, Mendosa, say good bye before you leave. - Come on. Let's go. - The judge is waiting. Come on. Keep moving. 12O8. They're moving out. Over. Go now. - What's she doing? - Come on, move it! Move outta here, sweetheart. What the fuck do you want? Hurry up. Get in. Let's go man, vamonos. Buenos dias, amigo. Make a left here, then make another left. You lost your cargo, you dumb fucks. Adios, pendejos. Keep it running. Better, hold onto this. It's good to be back. Gracias. Let's go. You're gonna be a big hero with my uncle, man. Mucho dinero. - Hey there. - Hey, Luis. Hey, Luis. Bienvenido. Hola, Lupe. Luis, donde has estado? Hola. Tio? Luis, que tal? Muy bien. Dejame verte. Gracias por sacarme de ese infierno tio. Sientese. Una cerveza para mi sobrino. Very smooth piece of work. Your job got you on the 5:00 news and the cable down here. It's all there. You can check it if you wish. Thank you for bringing my nephew back to me. Who could do such a terrible thing to my nephew, huh? Luis was a nice family man, but his accounts were short for 100 million pesos. Nice doing business with you. Ya va saliendo de el edificio. - Fuck me. Shit. - Let's go. Vamonos. We're out of here, boss. Manos arriba, gringo. Gracias. Can I help you, ma'am. I'm here to see my husband, Carter McCoy. Okay, come through the gate. Vaya por ahi. Derecho. MEN - Vente conmigo. - Tienes un visitante. Hi, Doc. Hi, baby. You been doin' okay? Pretty good. I-- I went to see my brother in Oklahoma. See his kids. God, Doc. Hey, hey. I think I've got a way out of this place. There's that guy that works in Phoenix. His name's Jack Benyon. Draws a lot of action on both sides of the border and he's planning something very big. He's looking for a guy that can handle security. Explosives. For the right guy he'll pull some strings. Benyon knows about me. You contact him. Tell him I'm for sale. Just get me the hell out of here. Can you do that? Can you do that for me? I'm not spending the next 20 years without you. Welcome to the Arizona Biltmore. Oh, My, my, my. You Doc McCoy's wife? That's right. Jim Deer Jackson. May I have your purse. I work for Mr. Benyon. Mrs. McCoy? I have to frisk you. Excuse me, Mr. Benyon, sir. Your guest has arrived. Call you back. I bet that made your day. My morning, anyway. Hello, Mrs. McCoy. I'm Jack Benyon. Nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. Sorry about Jim Deer here. Sometimes he enjoys his work too much. Mr. Benyon, I came here to talk about my husband. Won't you please, sit down? Sure. Thank you. Would you care for a drink? Scotch, please. Rocks. Be fine. How's your husband? He could be a lot better. Prisons in Mexico... aren't very nice. Even harder for a gringo down there, isn't it? A shame for a fellow with all his talent. I understand you have a job. Maybe you could help each other out. It's possible. Thank you. Doc's in prison. In Mexico. It's complicated. I can get myself another guy. Why should I bother with your husband. Doc's the best. Isn't that what you want? Yeah, that's what I want. So just how cooperative are the McCoys willing to be? Very. You know? You deserve a lot better. You're way out of his league. How long has he been in? Over a year. Oh. That's a long time, isn't it? It's a very long time. Yeah. What's your name? McCoy. Va a salir McCoy. Esta bien. Que te vaya bien. Aeropuerto. Arizona Air flight from Phoenix to Tucson, will be departing in five minutes. I'm sorry I'm late. Did you wait long? No. Not long. I missed you so much. I can't get a good station on here. I'm just as nervous as you are. Your best time. Can we do this again on Saturday? Yes, Mr. Benyon, no problem. That's who we've got to beat. That's what you said last Saturday. It sounds good. Make it a short day. Good work, Sam. Right, sir. May I get you a beer, son? No, thank you. Guess you don't mix business and pleasure, huh? Me, I mix them all the time. Your wife spoke highly of you. You're lucky man to have such a woman to run your errands. What can I do for you? Dog track right here in town. A very well-built safe. Big vault room. Just like a bank. There's no money at the dog races. Even the payroll is small time. Well, this track's different. It will be there. Trust me. How much? Million, maybe two. Maybe more. You see, I know the people running the operation. I use to get a cut of the action until they decided they didn't need me anymore. They were wrong. What's the deal? I keep two-thirds. You keep one. You take care of your crew out of your end. Pretty generous, considering I got you out of prison. And I can put you right back in. Let's go meet your boys. I got you some professionals. I like to use my own people. It doesn't much matter what you like, does it? There he is. Just like old times. Good to see you, Doc. They finally let you out, huh? Hey, I'm Frankie Hansen, pleased to meet you. You worked with Jack Easler, right? Yeah. Cops blew Jack up, actually, couple months ago. Where? Baton Rouge, payroll job. Where else you worked, Frank? I hit some liquor stores and I drive real good. And I shoot nice. You shoot nice, huh? Yeah. Where'd you learn? Army. Army, huh? I'm a team player. You guys, just do your job. You stay clean, I stay clean. Real simple, right? Right. That's the last time you and I meet in public. If you got any more business with me, you handle it with my associate Jim Deer. McCoy. I didn't want to leave you. We both know you had all the money. Maybe I should've waited, but I didn't want to stick around. What am I gonna do? Go to jail like you? Look, I'm not the kind to apologize so I'm not gonna. Benyon wants me and that's the end of it. He ain't gonna back down. Let's just make the best of it. No hard feelings, alright? Boy, you're touchy, Doc. Don't fuck me again. No hard feelings. Asshole. Once we wrap it up in the vault room, if everything... I should say.. When everything times out perfect, we've got the tanker in the parking field north of the track. It blows, there's your diversion. Inside the vault room. Two, maybe three guards, probably two accountants in the safe area itself. One guard with a 38 mm on your right hand side when you come through this door. That's him on the monitor right now. Let's take care of him right away. Be careful that he doesn't panic and try to shoot somebody. One of these boys does try to get off a shot this might come in handy. I've been working 10 years without one of these. I sure as hell that I don't need it now. Might change my luck. No... Not for me. Suit yourselves. After that, we're gonna switch cars at... Sutter's Ranch. Sutter's Ranch. Once I settle up with Benyon, we're all gonna meet in Tucson to... cut up the money. Unless, of course, we're hot, in which case we'll have to travel to El Paso. Why do we have to go all the way to El Paso? I know a guy there runs a place called the Border Hotel. He can get us some passports, some ID's... Stuff's expensive, but it's the best. Get us into Mexico nice and clean. And after that, boys, it's adios and good-bye. Why do we have to go in so hard? Don't have to be John Dillinger for this one. Dillinger got killed. Yeah. Old Johnny got shot in the back. Bang, bang, bang. You alright? Benyon said I was a lucky man. You are... ...a lucky man. Oh yeah? You trust me? Yeah, I guess so. You better. Tell me everything's gonna be okay tomorrow, Doc. I don't wanna spend any more time without you. You're not the only one who's ready to quit this life. You spend some time in prison, you do a lot of thinking. Listen to me. This is gonna be our last job. You know that, don't you? You mean it? Really? You do? Get out! Jesus. Sorry. Okay. Couple more feet. Go, go, go. Good. Come on, come on. It's all okay. Thanks. Ten seconds. What's going on here? The emergency power should've come on. Why don't you close the vault? I'm just gonna find out what's going on. You better set the time lock. Ready? Let's go. Bill, the phones are dead. Watch out! On the floor, heads towards the wall now! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun on the floor! Do what he says. Everybody out. Let's go. Move! Move! Everybody out, move! Move, move, move! No, don't hurt me! - We can't open the safe. - It's on a time lock. Don't anybody move or you're dead! I want quiet. Shut up! Don't move! Don't anyone move! I'm down. Stay, stay, stay! Quit crying and shut up. Put your head down. Oh, nice legs! Put your head down before I blow it off. You trying to be a hero? You'll be a dead hero. One minute, 30 seconds. Come on, let's go. Let's hurry. He had a gun, man! He had a gun. He was reaching for a gun. He pulled it from his pant leg. The bozo reached for his gun. Stop pointing that fucking thing at me! What, man? He had a gun, man. He had a gun. I'm sorry. Slow down! Just slow down! You okay? Guess so. How far away is it? Fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes. Is he going to meet us there? He's gonna be there. Hold the wheel. Sure. God! See you. What happened to Hansen? Oh, he didn't make it. Neither did you. That's what I always liked about Rudy. He was predictable. Let's get out of here. What's Benyon's place like? I don't know. I met him at the office. Doc, what if we headed south and just kept on going? We got lots of money here. Why share it? Benyon's kept his end of the bargain so far. You don't owe Benyon anything. I'll try to wrap this up quick. If anything happens, you.. ...do what you gotta do. Thought I might never see you again. The news said one dead. Three dead. Hansen got jumpy and shot a guard and Rudy got ambitious and killed Hansen, then he.. lost his head and tried to kill me. How's your wife? Let's cut up this money. I wanna get out of here. I don't like complications. Well, you pull these kind of jobs, you take those chances. You know, McCoy? You and I are two of a kind. No, I don't think so. I like to do my own dirty work. I never much liked guys like you, the crooks that want to look respectable. You still don't get it. Funny, I always heard you were smart. So let's just look at the situation. One, a very attractive woman. Two, the woman's husband, a killer and a thief serving a long sentence in a Mexican hellhole. Three, a businessman. Lots of power and influence. A fellow who could easily get the husband a pardon. But why should he? Well. One simple reason, the obvious reason.. Money. But maybe there's other considerations. The wife is very attractive and she proves to be willing. Very willing. She sees an opportunity and she takes it. Who can blame her? She's tired of life on the run. Her husband, he's a loser. She wants something better and so the inevitable happens. A very... intimate alliance. A very pleasurable alliance. Enjoyed by both parties vigorously and repeatedly. Enjoyed. And then the moment arrives. The husband is baited to a remote place. A place... Well, Doc, kind of like this. Don't think too badly of your wife, Doc. After all, you were locked up in prison. She is a stunningly healthy young woman. I see you've been practicing. It wasn't my fault. It was the only way. Stupid bitch, you should have told me. You were supposed to make a deal with him, not fuck his brains out! The deal wasn't good enough! You should've walked away! Then you'd still be sittin' in that shithole. I trusted you! Yeah, and I came through for you too! Yeah, repeatedly. Fuck you! You weren't straight with me. I didn't think you could handle the truth, and I was right. You weren't sure which one of us you were gonna shoot, huh? Is that what you think? Yeah, that's what I think! Then I'm sorry. Sorry you shot Benyon? No. I'm sorry I fucked him. Because I did it for you and you're not worth it. Bitch! Get in. Go to hell. Get in. I guess you did what you had to to get me out. You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc? You would humiliate yourself for me, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? Fuck. Honey, there's a man out here. Who is it? I don't know. Oh, God! Okay, what's the damage here? That glucose should start to work in about a half-hour. You'll feel better then. That collarbone's badly shattered. There's no infection yet. You should just... keep changing those bandages several times a day. Looks like I'm gonna need myself a nurse. Get over there where I can see you, come on. That's better. You know, on second thought. I think it might be wiser to leave the bandages in place. 'Cause I'm nervous you'll irritate the wound. Is that what you thought? Come on over and sit down. Get over here and sit down? Come here. You think real hard.. ...and tell me the truth. Am I going to need more looking after or not? Well, you see, there's... Yes, there's a chance of gangrene setting in. Lovely. Alright. The three of us are gonna do some driving. Tomorrow morning, we'll take your car and go to El Paso. Wait, no. That's just not possible. Look, we can't leave here, okay? We've got our work, we gotta take care of these animals. What do you say, friend? Do some travelling? Sure. I mean, whatever you say. What kind of car you got here? A Chevy. We have a Chevy Suburban. That's nice. I like Chevies. Why don't you go outside and gas it up? Check the tires and check the oil, Make sure it's gonna run good, 'cause I don't want any trouble on the road. And If you come back in here with anyone else.. ...I'm gonna stop her clock. You got that? She dies. Do what he says, Harold. That's right, Harold. Now go. Get the fuck out of here. Come here, honey. Come here, polka dots. Sit down. What's his name? Kitty. He's cute. So are you. How long has he been dead? A few hours at least. Hell, they probably halfway to Mexico. Hansen said they'll split the money in Tucson, but if they got hot, they'd head to El Paso. A place called The Border Hotel. I'll check both places. Put out the word. I know somebody's got our money. What about Benyon? There's a dry well about a mile from here. Jack deserves a proper burial. You just do what I tell you. The explosion of a tanker truck which panic... ...all part of an extremely well organized robbery... We go now to his report from the dog track earlier today. A lot of folks were at the dog track today trying to get lucky. But some got luckier than most. This explosion seems to have been a decoy for a large robbery. Details are sketchy, but this is what we know. One guard has been killed. Police officials believe it's the work of experts, they knew what they were doing. But they don't know who pulled this robbery off. Fucking Pinhead Hansen. I say we dump that wagon and hop on the train to El Paso. We still heading to Gollie's. We gotta get some new passports. You got a better idea? You okay? Sure. Don't I seem okay? I don't know, if you were still pissed at me I probably wouldn't know anything about it. You'd just act like everything was alright anyway. I'm not following you. You'd want me to think you'd forgotten even if you hadn't. I don't trust you, Doc. Hey, I got an idea. Here, this should prove something. Take your gun back. Go on, take it. It's not loaded. That's right. You emptied it into Benyon. Here, take mine. Go ahead. I don't want it. Go on. I don't want it. Got plenty of money here. You could go wherever you wanna go. Asshole. I found you one of Harold's T-shirts. Could be a little small for your body, but it's clean. Let me have it. I wouldn't worry too much about Harold if I were you. He's not gonna bring anyone back here. He's harmless. Ain't that the truth? How long you two been married? Two years. An exciting two years. I'll bet it's been. Hanging around this place, fixing up poor little doggies. Come here. Look. I'm not going to be any trouble to you. Fact is, this may sound kind of funny, but I was thinking that... maybe you and I could be friends. Been my experience that having friends is overrated. Oh, well. Come here. You don't always have to point that gun at me. I'll do whatever you want. Really. I will. What are you wearing underneath that dress? Nothing. Turn around. Sit down. Rub off that nail polish, 'cause I don't like it. When I tell you to come here, you move your ass real fast. Because I got you figured out from the start. Go ahead. Wait a second. Get rid of this too. Come here. Don't get blood on me. I hate blood. I'll park the car while you get the tickets. Meet me in the bar. Okay. That bag's kinda heavy. Why don't you let me take it? It's not heavy. I can handle it. Hey, you. Don't park here. Use the structure around the corner Yes, sir, boss. Here are your two tickets to El Paso, your change and your train should be leaving in one hour. Thank you. Attention all passengers. The train to El Paso has been delayed and will be departing in 90 minutes. Thank you. Let me help you with that. No, that's okay. No, no. It's a big bag. There you go. Thank you. Glad to help. Tequila. Sauza okay? That's fine. Would you like another? Please. Guess you have to catch a train? That's right. Yeah, me too. I'm going home. Where's home? Utah. The Beehive State. I'm from Orem, it's right near Salt Lake. Say, you wouldn't happen to be Mormon, would you? There's about 12 people in the state that aren't Mormon. And I'm one of them. Well, that makes you kinda special then, huh. Yeah, I guess it does. Say, you wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you? No... No, I'm afraid not. Never have any luck. Sorry. Where is it? It's in a locker over there. Show me. You just can't forget about it, can you, Doc? Let's go. Maybe we should cut the money and split up right here. If that's how you feel about it, then fine by me. We've lost something, Doc. I think Benyon got to you. At least I got to him. I know I put it in this locker. Hey, what are you trying to pull? I put it in this locker. A man helped me just a few minutes ago. Someone helped you? Then I went to the bar. What did he look like? He was tall. He had a red shirt. I put it in that locker. He switched the keys. It's the oldest trick in the book. Come on, let's go. Do you see him? Look at every face. Concentrate. Do you see him? No. Maybe he went outside. That's him! Move! Bye. Bye. Can you help me with my bag? No problem. The toilets will be open in 5 minutes. Don't even. Next time you pick that lock, don't leave them scratch marks, brother. Harold. Hey, put that away. What? Give me some pain pills. Harold, this? Yes. So, Rudy, why are we going to El Paso? I gotta look up some old friends. I got to pick up a suitcase then I'm head south of the border. Real far south. That sounds great. I love to travel but Harold never wants to go anywhere. That's not true. It's true. We never go anywhere. He'd rather stay home and play with his critters. Isn't that right, Harold? You poor old bugger. I got us a car that I hot-wired. Come on, let's go. Bye. Bye-bye. Here, Harold. have some chicken. Harold. No, no. Look, I got to pull over I gotta pee. Have some fries. Rudy! Have some fries. Have some chicken. Hey, some chicken. Damn it. What'd you do that for? You know why I did that? No. It makes me feel good. Have some fries. No, you have some fries. Hey! - Have some fries, Harold. - Have a biscuit, Rudy. Hey! Yes, have more fries. Have some chicken. Ha, ha, ha, chicken. You have some chicken. Have some beans. Fran, get back here! You sit up there. I've got to pull over. I've got to pee. Um, I guess we should stop because Harold has to pee. Get back in the front. Get back up there with Harold. Get up there! I don't want to play this game anymore! You pee in your pants. Looks like this guy's a real pro. Where'd you get this? It was a gift. I told you. The guy gave it to me. Yeah. That's him. Carter McCoy. Harold. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY Harold, get back in there, you pervert. Hey, Gollie, it's Doc. Yeah. Yeah right. How's those travel arrangements coming? Good. Yeah, she's doing alright. Right, thanks. We're all set. Good morning, how you doin'? Who had bacon? Right here. Enjoy your breakfast. Anything else I can get you? No, thank you. Carter McCoy. also known as Doc McCoy, is wanted by police... Doc. ...he is also wanted in connection with the hijacking and fire-bombing of a tanker truck in the track parking lot. He's an expert safe-cracker. His criminal record includes numerous other well-planned thefts. Considered by authorities as the probable mastermind behind the heist. he is thought to be well-armed and extremely dangerous... Dad, that's the guy. ...immediately contact law enforcement officials. Here we go, Mel. I think she's gonna like it. You say hello to Alice for me, will you? Yes, sir. What can we do for you today? Let's see. I'll take that black 12-gauge pump gun. Ah, the Minelli. That's a good choice. This is a very powerful weapon here, sir. As a matter of fact, my brother-in-law uses this very gun to hunt ducks, if you can believe that. If you hit a duck with one of these suckers you're not gonna have many pieces left to eat. That's a good weapon, though. What else can I get for you? 4 boxes of double-aught buck. Double-aught buck. Alright. Four of them. Here we go. That sounds like a hunting trip I'd like to be on. These will knock down a wall for you if you need it. Four boxes. 45 auto shells. 45 auto shells. Where'd I put those? Okay. All we need now is a little bit of identification. and fill this out for Uncle Sam. 1 through 8. Don't forget number C, "Are you a fugitive from justice." Don't worry about that. They ask everybody to do that. Let's see-- You're gonna need a case for this. 50% off this week on both hard and soft cases. I got a dandy here for you. Right here-- Wrap the shotgun. Wrap the shotgun. Forty-twenty-three. I need a Ten-twenty-eight on an Arizona plate. Sam, Paul, Queen, 4-8-5. This'll be on a 1987 metallic-blue Camaro. Are you sure you want to do this? Shut up and lie down. Take a little nap there. Alright. Alright. Alright. I know the drill. Count to 100, right. One, two, three, four, five-- I'm getting out of this business. Six... Keep the change. Excuse me, are you available for hire? Shift's over. Sorry, lady. Sorry. What are you doing? Shift's over. You'll have to get another cab. We're heading east, pal. Straight out of town. - Car 279. Car 279. - Come in. Can you do another pickup? That's you. Answer it. What do you want me to say. Tell them you've got a fare. Come on, the dispatcher won't fall for that. He'll know the cab's hijacked and we're on 3rd-- He's got the radio mike on and he's telling where we are. Make a right turn here or I'm gonna put one in you right now, pal. Okay. - Hey! Get out of there! - Now! Let's go! Let's go! Doc, come on! Let's go! Let's go! Get in! Stay with him! Keep it steady! On the right. - On your right. - On your right! Come on! Hang on, Doc. Keep going! Keep going! They're in the block in the other building parking area. We're gonna jump in this thing. No way. We gotta keep moving. No shit, Doc. Shit! Cops are out there. We're going in the garbage truck. Stay back! God! No! Get back! Get back. All the way to the back. What are you looking out the window for? Somebody else coming after me? Hey, kitty. Look, Rudy, he likes that. Give me that. Rudy! Harold, come out of the bathroom. Harold, come on out. My shoulder hurts. Harold? Rudy. What are you doing in there? Hey, Fran. I think it's time to check out. You okay? I think so. I don't know. Hey, don't scratch like that yourself around here. You're gonna get an infection. I wanna tell you something. And I don't wanna hear it. Hey. This is hard for me. When we get to El Paso. I think I should take off. Hey. Listen to me. I want you to stick with me. No more about Benyon. You and me. What do you say? Can't get much worse than this, Doc. I don't see how it could. Got us a car. Get a couple of tires, we're in business. God. Yep. When we get to Mexico, we're gonna have a new life, right? That's all I want. Yeah, Tom here. Tell Jim Deer Rudy and some girl just drove up. Looks like they're heading in the hotel. Hi, folks. Welcome to the rustic Border Hotel. You must be Gollie. By Golly, I am Gollie. This here's my wife, Carmen. I call her Tootsie. That's our three-year-old daughter, her name's Anna. That's my son, Jim. He's 17 years old. He's a Jack Rabbit. We need a room for three. Three. Oh, you got a cat. No problem. You need a room, you came to the right place 'cause we got lots of rooms. Room 309. Hot out there. Boy, I tell you, it must be 114 degrees. Y'all come in for the races, I bet. I tell you, Y'all watch your step. Watch your step please, ma'am. A horse'll run a good second faster out there than it would in any other track in the country. That is just something. Now, one thing does hold true for a speed horse. A speed horse runs just as hard as he can as fast and as long as he can. What they try to do is they try to rate those things and oh, that's a whole another story. This here... This here is your living room. Bathroom. Shower. Toilet. Bedroom. Bed. On the top drawer you got the Gideon Bible. Right out here you got a veranda. It's just a beautiful sunset there. Now, here you go. What's in there? That'd be your closet there, it's a... God! What...? Oh! Oh! Oh! Open up your mouth. Say "Ahh". Ahh. You got two choices here, pal. You can live or die. What's it gonna be? I don't wanna die. You do the right thing, you might even make a bit of money. I'll tell you what, I'll go check us into the hotel and you go find some place around here and get us some clothes. Here you go, Doc. Passport. Credit card. Driver's license. All cherry stuff. Never been reported. That stuff's so good you can go anywhere you want. No matter how hot you may be. Here's the key to your room. 234. Nobody else on that floor but you. All you gotta do is lay low for a while and we'll get you out of here, okay? Carol went to get us some fresh clothes. We're both real hungry. You send up some food as soon as you can. How about sandwiches? That'll be fine. It's gonna be an hour, maybe more. When she gets back, have your kid take care of what she need. I gave him the day off. Then you do it. I can't. I... I've got to watch the front desk. You know how it goes. Doc, look, I'll work on the food, okay? Doc. This ain't the Hilton. Can I come in? Sure. Hey! Give me that room key or I'll kill you and I'll kill your little kitty too. You see Gollie's face when he bounced off that door? "Hey, Gollie, what's in here?" "I don't know. Let's find out." "Open your mouth. Open it wider." Yep. He's here. Room 234. Wants me to bring him up some sandwiches in about an hour. Yeah, 234. Hang it up. Get dressed. Good flight, Jim? They still in there? Yeah, both of them. McCoy and his wife showed up a little while ago. Mm-hm. That's nice. - Fire up the grill, boys. - It's barbecue time. Want some of these? Let's go, baby. Come on. Hey, wake up. Come on. Let's go. What's the matter? Get dressed. We're leaving right now. What is it? It's Gollie. Something bothering me about him. He's always got his family around. The wife and kid always sticking close to make sure he stays away from the horses and the booze. So what? If they're not here then there's something wrong. Maybe they took the day off. What's the plan? The plan is shut up. Come on, baby. We've got to move. Who is it? Sandwiches for Mr. McCoy. It's your food, ma'am. He's in the shower. Can you leave them outside? No, I can't do that, ma'am. You'll have to pay now 'cause I have pay back the boy that brought up the food. Well, I'm not dressed, you'll have to wait. Hello? Alright. Ma'am. How much longer are you gonna be? Don't touch my Rudy! Don't hurt my Rudy! Don't hurt my Rudy! Don't hurt my Rudy! Let's get outta here. What is it? Is it uh...204? Is it a...314? Ooh. Ooh. My, my, my, my. Now, you may wanna watch this. What are you gonna do with that thing? What are you doing? No. No! Like that? - Please, let me go! - It's 309. There he is. Get him! - Get the bastard. - Get him down. I'm down! She's a cunt for Christ's sake, get over there! Get over there! I'm hit! I'm hit! Get out there! Come on. I'm hit! I'm hit! Here we come! Just put down the bag, Doc. We don't give a shit about what you did to Benyon. We just want the money. Hit them! Gee... Get ready. Meet you up on the roof. Yeah. Come on. Get McCoy. He went around the corner. Go! Go! Oh! Was that gunfire? No, that's someone's TV. Rudy? Rudy? Rudy? Rudy? Where's Rudy? Rudy. Rudy. Rudy? Rudy? Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Oh! Shit! Hey! Get up! Oh! - Come on! - Stand up! Where are you going, doc? Get up and turn around! I wanna see your face. Get up. Stand up! Oh! Should've killed me when you had the chance. Bang. Bang. Doc! Fucking thing. Shit! See you later, Doc. He's a tall man, and he has... Rudy! Give me the gun. Get out of here. Run! Out the back. - Go around there. - Watch your back. He's got a trunk. Hey, man. We need a lift. All you got to do is ask. Get in. Where we headed? Mexico. I love Mexico. You know, I was thinking about taking a trip down there myself. Not in this big a hurry, though. Hang on! Take it easy, fella. Well, I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you? I kinda doubt it. That's good. I'll cooperate. don't worry about that. Yes, sir, I've had a few run-ins with the law myself. Is that right? About 3 years ago I dynamited some fish down by the reservoir. That little job cost me 100 dollars. They wouldn't even let me keep the fish. - What's your name? - Slim. You're a bad boy, Slim. Where are you going today? You sure this is gonna work? Absolutely positive. What if it doesn't? I'll floor it. Buenos dias, Slim. Como estas? Doing just fine, Jose. This here's my nephew and his wife. We thought we'd go over and do a little sightseeing. Don't forget to buy something. Si, senor! You got my word on that. I didn't think we'd have a problem back there. I've got me a little senorita here in town. Fellas kind of know me. You got a senorita? Mm-hm. Shame on you. Your wife know about it? Well, my wife's been gone for ten years. If she was still around, I wouldn't be going no place but home. Are you two married? Yeah. Well, it's tough all sometimes, but let me tell you, it's well worth it. I think the most important thing in life is something you've got to give to each other. Don't ever forget it. Pull over up here. You folks gonna be alright out here? Let me ask you something. How much money did you make last year? 12 000. I tell you I'll give you 20 000 for the truck. Are you serious? I sure am. Phew. And... I keep my mouth shut and I don't... say nothing about the truck and I've never seen you two before, right? You got it. Could...? Could you make it 30? How about 40? Damn. Ma'am, you've got a deal. She's all yours. You'll have to make your own way back to the border, though. Oh, I'll make it. Don't worry about me. Vaya con Dios. Same to you. She's a good old truck. She won't win any races, but she'll run forever. I just put new brakes in her. Good. Y'all take care, you hear? See you. Damn! Adios, amigos.
