This is just one of the many. Take a look. These are all mine! Ren. You've always been a brother to me, let me be frank with you. Base on what you have right now. Seven clubs, five pubs, four massage parlors. Correct? And this, this is what I have now. Since I am able to operate in such scale so trust me when I say. Let us use your turf to move the goods. You and your boys will no longer have to go through troubles to make easy money. Well? You must be kidding me. When comes to fighting, i never turn down any of them. But international business like this? This isn't my cup of tea. Do you look down upon my business or do you look down upon me? Brother. There's never "Too much wealth". However, it really matters on how those money are made. This is beyond me. Brother, don't get me wrong. That's fine. I know that you respect the old man. He has his moral code. But he'll come around. We'll talk more later. I'm hungry now. Braised pork over rice. Let's get some braised pork over rice, from that same old place. Do you still go there? Remember that girl used to work there? Ren. Madam. Don't stay for too long, remember your heart condition. Get up. Yes, your highness. Wife is the real boss around here. Remember, her words are the law. Yes, sir. Take care. - So many people. - Yeah, The more the merrier. Where is Chao? Isn't he coming? Chao? He's probably busy today. He's a grown-ass man, no need to worry about him. He's coming later. I just hope he can be more mature like you. He's always like a kid. Tell Chao. It's his grandfather's anniversary in two days. Remind him to take me there. I can't even find him. Okay, i'll remind him. Come, let's get something to eat. Sure. Watch your step. Po. Let's go, kiddo. - Remember to say hi to everyone. - Sure. Where is Chao now? Why would I know? He called me this morning to pickup his grandmother. Then he disappeared himself. Let me call him. Okay, go ahead. Panda. C'mon! Cut the shit. Boss, The man is here. Sir. I'm Chao from North Fort, one of Ren's boys. What do you want? Say it. I'm here for the good. Let me ask you a question. Do you think supplying drug is a dirty business? Dirty? Why? It's just business. However, Ren doesn't think so. He thinks drug is beneath him. He thinks he has no need for money. Therefore. He doesn't know you are here. He forbade you from dealing with drugs, didn't you know that? Chao, isn't it? Hey! What is this aboutl? Po. Chads grandmother is asking who is getting married. - Grandma, it's Pretty-Pan -Grandma, it's me! Pretty-Pan is getting married. - You're all invited. - Please join us that day. This is a good day toast to it, toast! Congratulations! As we hold our hands, our hearts connect instantly. As I look at her, that cutie looks right back. As we part away, i wondered who that beauty was. Hey! There aren't any prawn in the pond! Here's more. Still aren't any! Wait here, keep the engine running. Move! And with same heaven above us, we share the blessing of this world. Ren remember this song? Come, sing with me. We live in this world, there is love and there is hate. As a family, why must we harm each other? Of all the unnecessary death, who is the one responsible for it? Of those who remain, whose rage is still burning? Hey-ho, hey-ho, such is the Wrath under the heaven. My brother. Now that I am here. Isn't it the time for you to return my boy to me? Before I do that. I must explain what happened. You. Refuse to do business with me. However, your boy, Chao. Chao, isn't it? He, came to deal with me behind your back. Isn't that a shame? Therefore. I have punished him for you. Fuck you, who do you think you arel? Qing. Boss, i am sorry. Panda, take care of him. - Chao. - Are you alright? Brother. Fine consider this as my fault. I had you to do my job for me. Sorry about it. We've been brothers for so many years there's no need to apologize. To be frank. Though you as the boss have no need for money. Yet your boys are eager. So I already have a plan for you and your boys. Imagine if I let you have the North Town now. And have all your boys to run the place while distributing the products. We're going to be rich as fuck. Brother. So you're saying if I refuse to cooperate then I'll ended up like Simple-Chun. You will have me "taken care of" as well, right? Don't say that. There's no need to turn a brother of yours into your worst enemy. Do you remember? The lucky 7 you gave me? I believe now you will need that luck more than me. Phone call for you. Hey, what's up? What? One second. Sit for a bit. I'll be back. Hey. Jian. When you were planning for everything three years ago. Did you anticipated the current situation? Let's go. Hey.

Why are we still here? Let's fuck them up! I'm going to kill them all. Qing. Get everything ready. Get everything ready. Move! Get ready! Boss. One second. Boss. I am being reasonable. But are they being reasonable? Boss. I remember everything you taught me and I understand all of them. But you know me, Boss. My boy took a bullet for me and now he is dead. If wasn't for him, i wouldn't be here and we wouldn't have this conversation right now. Can you understand, Boss? So we're just going to let them get away like this? Boss. Is it president again? Is it president again? But the one died is... take care of it. Understand. So we really have to wait here all night? Should just leave it to the boys to handle it. Chao is our brother, we will avenge him ourselves. Chao. This is all for you. This is a little courtesy from us. Today is the anniversary of your passing. However, your grandson, Chao, isn't here. Chao is such a nice kid. But he's always out there somewhere you can never find him. Here he comes. Big-Syko. This is fun. Wow! So much fun! Hey, that's enough. That's enough. Let's go now. Enough.

Tell them not to mention a word. Understood. Boss. Let's do this. North Fort piece of shit. Smash all of it. Wreck this place! It's definitely Jian Corp. Cut the shit, it's war time! Ready? Ready -Let's go. Fuck off. Fuck 'em up. Where is your boss now? Everyone here? Tie up your red bands. Make sure you don't hit one of our own. Yes, sir. Let's do this. Boss, i have to someone to deal with. Be smart about it. Go. Fang. Pan. Hey. Pan, is that you? What the fuck are you looking at? Fuck you, piece of shit. Come at me. Enough. Meh, sir. These traitorous dogs started it! Shut the fuck up. Enough, sit down. Are you done? How old are you? Because I'm already sick and tired of this shit. I'm already sick and tired of this shit. Sir. It's definitely them. Don't tell me how to do my job. You'll see. Your president never taught you how to behave? Do you solve all your problems with violence? So you think you're untouchable. What now? Everywhere. Know this. You're already standing in your own grave. If you are willing to take out your own boss. Then you're free to go. Are you out of your mind? Or was it me?

What is going on now!? What is this about? Say something! Boss. I understand. You have your reason to stay silent. Now that two of our boys died. Your boys. My brothers. If I don't do something right now. How am I supposed to avenge them? Qing. Boss. I'll handle it well. Handle what!? You the boss now!? Here, take my position and let me take orders from you. Somebody killed my boys. Is it because I failed as a boss or are you getting to ambitious? Ren, i don't understand. I thought Jian and you were like brothers. How did it all came to this? Brothers, so what? People change. Like everything else. Back then, it's about loyalty. Now, it's about profit. I sincerely hope everyone will be okay. Especially you. Mr. Jian. Now that both sides are in conflict. Situation has not improved. Instead, it has gotten worse. Her highness is not happy about it. The conflict between North Fort and North Town. That was all part of my plan. This is the perfect time for me to take control over them one by one. If you're unable to contain the situation. I will have to. Step-in to do my job.

He was the youngest, and now he is gone too. Is this how you treat your brothers? Why would him do it for me? I told him to wait for me in the car. If you did shoot that motherfucker this wouldn't have happened, was it really that difficult? Do you really I'm that brave? It's all because of you. Because you were always there to back me up. I thought I was always fearless. When you were around. How would I know what would happen when you aren't there, i really have no idea. Stop it. Fuck fuck. Please stop it. Fuck, fuck.

Thanks for coming. You wanted to see me, i'd crawl my way here if I have to. Thank you, thank you. Boss. Secretary is here. - Mr. Secretary. - Mr. Secretary. This is brother Yung. - Welcome. - President Gui. Thanks for coming. It's my pleasure. - Thank you, once again. - Pleasure, pleasure. Senator, thank you for coming. President. Thank you, thank you all for coming. I am honored to be among you. For the good of this community. I humbly ask for advices from all of you. Thus we can settle our differences. Mr. Liu. Perhaps you have some suggestions? President, you are like a great father. Trying to be the peacemaker for Ren and I. I am so touched. Really touched my heart. President. You're not young anymore. Times have changed. Why don't you just take a back seat. Young man, watch your manner. President. Your dog is trying to take a bite out of me. You can't just hold on to his leash forever. Besides. He is already beyond your control. Go on, keep going. Why don't you guys keep going? I could use a boost to my career. President, Yung, i'll take my leave. My apology. Congressman, this way. Son of a bitch. I've never seen anyone more disrespectful than that little shit. Boss, let me drive you home. Let Qing do it, i want to have a few words with him. Qing. Do you know what does it mean to be Gatao? Early days in Taiwan, there were many Gatao and they were not gangsters. They were a bunch of passionate young men with sense of justice. They wanted to protect the interests of local people and they fought the outsiders. As the time goes by, they gain many followers and became forces to be reckoned with. That's how they won the heart of people and became the local leaders. That is the real Gatao. Now that North Fort is such a prosperous place. People are able to live their lives in peace because of us. You can't always solve problems with violence. Instead, you have use your virtues. Understand? Therefore. You shouldn't continue to provoke Ren, your boss. Instead, you should support him. Bring stability to our Gatao. President. I get everything you're telling me and I understand all of them. However, it is others who brought this onto us. I know! I know! No matter how much anger you have right now. I want you to swallow all of them. I... president? The medicine. Where is your medicine? President is talking to Qing. Gui! Gui! Gui! Ambulance, call the ambulance! The fuck are you doing over there? What's going on? Say something. Qing. Fuck. That was my boss! My boss! Fuck. Boss, let me drive you back. Chu, where is the car? Boss, it's that way. Boss, qing. Have you ever regret taking this path? After I came here, i ask this question myself constantly. I just want to be with you guys. Like a family. These days, i couldn't do anything but get drunk. I have no future. I miss you guys. I miss Panda, i miss Chao. - It's Pretty-Pan. - Grandma, it's me. Pretty-Pan is getting married. - I can fire three times and... - Hit five targets! So you were there? Hey dipshit, you should spend more time with your fiancee. Honey, remember the day. I promised you and our son a family. Sorry, i failed to keep my promise. Please forgive me. Boss Ren, where are you going today? Home. I really want to go back. Boss, big-Qing, thank you. I will never forget you. However, 20 years is too long for me. My heart couldn't take it. It's too empty without all of you. Honey, promise me, take care of our son. Don't let him grow up like me. Tell him his father loves him very much. Boss, big-Qing, i'm going home. Please take care of my family. And take care of yourself. Home. I am coming home. Pan, you're home. I told him to leave. He wouldn't. Because he said he had brothers like you. You were his family. How come they're the ones who died? Why? How come it wasn't you? Qing. The Big-Qng. You promised me, you promised you would bring him back. You promised me. This isn't what you promised, not like this. Why? Leave! Please, get out! Brother, it's me, Ren. This is the last time I'm calling you as a brother. This phone call is just a heads up. Now is just between you and me. You and me. Understood? Chu, chu! Yes, Boss. - Call Qing to come back. - Yes, Boss. Sweetheart. Let me answer the question you had for your teacher. The reason why you have to study hard ls so that you can have a proper career when you grow up. So you don't have to be like me constantly living on the edge. Honey. I'll be back in a bit. Big-Qing is back. What the fuck is going on? Boss only told me to call you back. What's going on? I don't know. Where is your boss? Ren, come. Join me. Come, help yourself. This braised pork over rice is from our favorite joint when we were young. The owner. She had a daughter, remember? During that time. I had nothing. Tried so hard to impress her. Now, i have everything. And she's already married. Such is life. You're right, people do change. Even this braised pork over rice doesn't taste the same anymore. The whole world is changing, if you don't change what makes you different than a caveman? Jian, i still have the same question for you. When you were planning for everything three years ago. Did you anticipated the current situation? Ren, do you know. Who do I envy the most? It is you. Though not having to spend a single dime. You've got a whole gang of brothers backing you up as for me. Look at me. The amount of money I spent yet, i have no one I can trust. This situation, it wasn't that I didn't think it through. It's just that I didn't expect it would end like this. Then we have nothing left to say. Hey. Why are you here? Ren, don't take this the wrong way. Let me ask you again, why are you here? It's about time, they're taking over. Ren. This world is no longer up to us. It seems you never get the point. It's not perfect but acceptable. I warned you. In the end, you still failed to contain the situation. Out of control? Everything is according to my plan. Both North Fort and North Town are now gone. Jian Corp. Has already taken majority of the Taipei. The northern Taiwan underground is now under my command. Isn't this what you asked me to do? Your command? You're still missing the point. What we wanted was stability. All you do is causing trouble. Tell me. How am I supposed to keep my job? Her highness has made her decision. Our cooperation ends here. Hey. Let me tell you something. Nobody tells me what to do. Nobody dares to tell me what to do. So? You're going to kill me now? I learned all of this from you guys. Ren, it's me. Boss, i'm here. Of all the fun, and you didn't invite me!? Watch out! Boss. Use this one. Boss, Qing is here. Po! Po! Just die! Boss. Qing, are you alright? I'm good. Are you hurt? I'm fine. Po, you alright? Clumsy as always. You aren't drunk again, aren't you? I got shot by the big one. Po, you alright? Should be fine. Next. Boss. Doing alright in there? Not bad. Got many friends looking after me. And they send you their regard. How is Po? Where is he? He got into a fight with someone. Fight? Again? If he doesn't shape up. He won't be calling us "brothers" again. Ha, i'll tell him. Boss, what about him? Don't know. I haven't heard of him since then. No worries. Boss. I'm sorry for causing you all the trouble. Dumbass, don't be silly. Make the best use of your time in there. You will be back before you know it, you hear? Yes, thank you boss. Send me a letter if you need anything. Boss. - Ask Chu if he also needs anything. - No problem. Here. Pull now. Hold right there. That's him! Hey, thanks, a little courtesy from me. Nah, don't worry about it. We're from the same school. You're such a badass. What are you going to do after graduation? I am from North Fort. My boss is Big-Gui. I am going to takeover the underground for him. What about you. Wanna join me? I'll probably... continue my study. I am Ren, what's your name? I'm Jian. What is the song of the family? The song of sorrow. This is it, The song of sorrow. I was born with the wrong sign. While others are fortunate, i had to live underground. As if the birds outside are crying for me. I had no choice but go with the tide. Though having fun on the surface, i feel hollow inside. Only alcohol can sustain me these days. Unable to face my past. Yet don't have the courage to take different path. * Rambo Media Ltd *
