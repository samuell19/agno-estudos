First, someone who occupies a rare place in our hearts, a sportsman who cuts across the demarcation lines that separate those people who love sport and those who hate it. As a player, his skills graced the game. As a manager, his teams adorned it. Ladies and gentlemen, Sir Matt Busby. You're the most famous man in soccer in this country and indeed, I suppose, in the world. You were more than a manager there. You were the boss, weren't you, really? - Well, er... - Come on. Quite a lot of people said that, yeah. When you look back, do you think that there was any part of it that caused you to sacrifice, and when you look back, do you think, "Well, it really wasn't worth it"? Oh, yes. We felt in a team. If we were trailing 2-0, we always had a feeling that we'd win 3-2. Those last-minute goals, the comebacks, even the defeats, are all part of this great football club of ours. I felt like a great family. Matt Busby is without doubt the greatest manager who ever lived. I remember walking the corridors up to the manager's office at Old Trafford. The smell of Sir Matt Busby's pipe... I can smell it now. The door would always be open. I look back now and think, "We should have gone in more and talked to him more." But you were scared. This was like a god. My mind goes back over the years, to the day of my birth in a small village in Scotland. I was born in a Pitman's Cottage. It was a small mining village, nothing else but mines. The people themselves were brought up in a faith which was football. Nothing else ever seemed to take place. Nobody else seemed to talk about anything else other than football. - Was your father a miner? - He was, yes. Was he also a footballer? Yes, he played in a local junior team and I understand had a lot of ability. But the war came on, of course. Then my father was killed in the First World War. I scarcely remember him. I was the oldest of four. There were three girls below me. And my mother, a very young age, she was. She had a tremendous influence on my life and of course the rest of the family's. She was a real Scotch type of mother, who put her foot down at the right time, and she brought us up with an idea of having some common sense and trying to be a citizen. And if you had a job to do, to do a job well. If you're speaking about Matt Busby and what he was like, Busby, like any man of his age, was a product of his time. There was quite a lot of depression in Lanarkshire with the coal mines and that type of thing. I'd been taken away from school. Before I knew where I was, I'd gone working in the mines to try and earn a few shillings, a few pounds, to help at home. The poverty that was in Britain was shocking. You were brought up in a mining village who were never thought of by governments as anything. We had tough upbringings to etch out a living in. When you think of back then, the working class were getting paid a pittance. Miners were treated like shit, for use of a better word. They were treated like slaves. For working-class people everywhere, one of the great ways of escaping the poverty, deprivation, marginalisation of a working-class existence was football. I started playing a little football again. Well, my mother wasn't very keen. I went on a trial with Manchester City. And anyway, when I came back, in the meantime, they'd influenced me to sign for them. Oldest manufacturing centre in the world, the cradle of modern industry. The old city's never stopped growing. And the more she's grown, the more it seemed she'd got to grow. Manchester City, a club with over half a century of history. Forty years ago, it became known by its present name. Today, Wilfred Wild, the secretary manager, receives thousands of pounds in entrance fees. Coming down about 17 and a half, just under 18 year old, and the first time coming from home, I knew I was trying to better myself but the place was strange and for a time, I wasn't too happy about it. I had a form of a complex at the time. I think it was a form of an inferiority complex. I thought the first team players were gods. And during this spell, I didn't do too well. It was probably the best part of a year and a half, kicking around, and at one time, I thought about going home. I was so disappointed, disillusioned in every way. We had, uh, I was in lodgings with an older player who was in the first team, a chap called Phil McCloy who, when he came in and saw me with this case, he says, "What's this you're doing?" I said, "Well, I feel as though I'm getting nowhere here." He says, "What's the case packed for?" I said, "I'm going to go home." "You're going to go home? What are you going home to?" And of course he talked me into staying. Busby's sense of judgement when he's taking a pass is one of his great assets and he can trap a ball with unfailing precision. - Are you pleased he did? - I'm delighted he did! For the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at war. The flames of war eat at the heart of Manchester. In one of the fiercest raids of the German Blitzkrieg on Britain, a storm of bombs wreaked havoc. Manchester will remember the horrors of that attack as long as the heart of the North continues to beat. Many a time I used to think how miserable life was. The one thing they did try and knock into you was the value of leadership. Busby had this aura about him. He was quiet. I never heard him raise his voice. I never heard him swear. He made you want to do things for him. So Matt had a great respect for human beings in general. That's why you ask anybody that met Matt, Matt treated people terrifically. He knew everybody and he made everybody feeling important. When the war came to an end, I, like many others, had to face some facts. Some hard facts. I was about 36 years of age. My days as a player were numbered. I couldn't live in memories. Yet I couldn't think of leaving this wonderful game of football. So I decided to try my hand as a manager. He arrived in Manchester to speak to the chairman in uniform because he had still to be demobbed from the army. Even though he had no management experience at all. So he had a very firm idea of what he wanted. I mean, mining communities are very close knit. The sense of cooperation, working together, that is a form of socialism in action. That flows from his working-class background. He had a vision of a club, a family, he thought of it as, where nobody was bigger than the club which was one of his mantras, always. They will absorb the culture and the club which is, "We're all family, we're in this together, they will behave in a certain way and they will play in a certain way." What kind of quality is it that you look for in a footballer that will go into your side? First of all, I look for ability. That is essential. Natural ability. I see natural ability... I like to see people that can play, that have got control, that have got a mind. I love to see a player with vision, somebody that can look at a places, look at a field and determine what he's going to do. I love to see a player playing with heart. And I also naturally want them to be of a kind. He just felt that his duty was to entertain. This was just after the war, when people had been five, six years in the war and they wanted something to enjoy. Men who worked in these factories, and they're working long hours and doing dirty jobs and they're going home on the bus or on their bikes, they come in on a Saturday afternoon to be entertained. He was a big, handsome, imposing man. He never looked in any way stressed or perturbed. And he beguiled people, he beguiled Harold Hardman and the directors of Manchester United. He was offered a contract as manager of Manchester United. This was people being impressed, seeing Matt as a leader. Someone in whom they could place trust. Somebody who could command respect of people who wouldn't normally give respect to a footballer or indeed to a working-class person. It was not an easy assignment. The ground had been blitzed. They'd an overdraft at the bank. I had no experience as a manager. I felt they were taking a great risk in appointing me. Guiding United is ex-star Matt Busby, keeping a player's eye on the first team workout. All I had was certain ideas as to what a manager should do, faith in those ideas and faith in the future of the club. I wanted them to mature and develop with the club. I believed in getting to know my players and not being chairbound in an office. Matt was the first of, the phrase was "tracksuit managers". Before, managers had been, you know, three-piece suits with a watch, perhaps, dangling from the pocket. Matt, literally, put on a tracksuit and boots, training with the players. Well, it's difficult to convey how revolutionary this was. The new soccer season gets a great send-off and these supporters of Manchester, who are typical of crowds who'll pack grounds in all parts of the country... Manchester United was obviously full, still, of players who had experienced the war, who'd come back to play for Manchester United, like Johnny Carey, Charlie Mitten, Johnny Aston. When he was 18, me dad ended up in the Royal Marines so he never saw football again for another five years. He finished up in Australia in the war, with the Marines and he said he had a lovely suntan, and he said he went into Busby's office and said, "Look, my name's John Aston." "Any chance of a game with the juniors?" And Busby looked at him and said, "Tell you what, son, you look fit." "I'll put you in the reserves on Saturday." What Matt showed in the early days was the ability to knit a team. And it was an absolutely brilliant team. He just had the gift of empathy. He could zero in on you and he knew what buttons to press. You had to be drawn to him. He wasn't coming at you. He was like a big cat. And you never quite knew which way he was gonna jump. They were very confident. They'd started to play in a manner that Busby was trying to get going, like a freedom of expression type of game. Manchester United took people by surprise, I think, almost snuck up on them. We thought, you know, "These Reds, they can win something." The all-Lancashire finalists take the field at Wembley. Manchester United in dark shirts, Blackpool in white. It's the North's big day. A close duel between Manchester's Johnny Carey and Blackpool's Walter Rickett, number 11, is highlight number one in a thrill-packed match. Manchester's Jack Rowley walking the ball into the net to equalise provides highlight number three. But now Manchester's attack, which has scored 95 goals this season, swings into its best style. From Johnny Morris' well-placed free kick, the fans cheer Jack Rowley's headed equaliser. Charlie Mitten, number 11, starts off United's winning attack and from Rowley's pass, Stan Pearson scores the goal that gives Manchester the Cup. Great day for Manchester. United's captain, Johnny Carey, receives the Cup from the hands of His Majesty the King. Careful, Johnny. Don't drop it now it is yours! And this is where United call once again on teamwork. Carey has the Cup, Mitten the lid and Pearson the plinth. United they call them and united they are. I'm very pleased to be taking this Cup back to Manchester again after a period of 40 years. Every man, woman and child of the cotton capital seems to be in Albert Square to cheer the 11 heroes of the hour, Cup-winning Manchester United. Well, now, Matt was very, very tough. One of the great characters of that team was Johnny Morris. Wonderful talent. After training, Matt asked him to do something and he walked off. That same night, he got a telephone call from the Press Association asking for a reaction to his being placed on the transfer list. Matt had gone straight off the training field, rung the Press Association and said, "I got a little story for you." This was not getting rid of a player who was on the fringes of the team. This was probably the best player of his kind in England. I can tell you easier what Matt Busby wasn't. He wasn't Father Christmas. He wasn't some benevolent figure. He was somebody with definite ideas and definite standards. There was a game at Old Trafford where Harold Hardman, the director of United for more than 50 years, sat there behind Busby in the directors' box, grumbling, I think about Johnny Carey, and everybody could hear. And Busby went into the gents at half-time and said to Hardman, you know, "Don't you ever criticise one of my players or me in public ever again," and laid down the law. Before Matt Busby, there were no football managers. Whoever was in charge of the football had power only to pick the team to play the next game. He was very much the boss. The '48 Cup win had sort of whetted people's appetites and they thought that some new era had dawned. Well, it hadn't quite dawned. United came runners-up in four of his first five years in the League. And by 1952, the players were getting old. The feeling was this was their last chance. Success in the League came in 1952 and the satisfaction that Matt felt in '52 was massive. And that really established not just United but Busby as a major figure in the game. We are going to build new schools with grounds for the kiddies to play. Playing fields for football and cricket, gardens for the old folk. Here and there in the district, you will find local shopping centres and clinics and nurseries, community centres and schools close to the houses. But remember this: whether we go ahead on plans like this for the whole city or whether we muddle along as we have done, most of Manchester anyhow will have to be rebuilt in the next 50 years. Because Manchester's falling down, decomposing in front of our very eyes. Food rationing didn't end till 1954, so it wasn't happy-go-lucky. It was a very grey area. Women didn't wear bright red or green dresses. You know, everything seemed quite grey. And the football colours, when you saw a football team, you know, you can imagine seeing Man United in their red, that was colour! As King Football kicks off to another great year, millions thrill to the nation's favourite Saturday afternoon sport. Into the limelight again come the stars of the game. A lot of people talk about United being super rich, but they weren't. United were very, very poor. And they knew that they had a very, very ageing group of players. So they both determined to start inventing their own. Busby himself was a great believer in youth. He knew that if you brought people in when they were teenagers, you became their father, and you could mould them to your way of thinking, to your way of playing. And of course, you didn't need to pay them so much. You could pay them less than the maximum wage. If you did it right, the style of play that would come through the B team and the A team and the reserve team, it would all dove-tail together. I believed in youth. I wanted them to mature and develop with the club. A year after I came here, I brought Jimmy Murphy. I'm quite sure this was one of the best signings I made. Busby was like the pipe-smoking thinker in team meetings. If you asked him anything he would give it a little bit of thought before he answered, whereas Jimmy, he was a bit more like a Chicago gangster. He used to smoke and smoke and smoke and he'd say, "Don't be so bloody stupid!" Or, "Yeah, that's a good idea!" You know, You'd get the instant... instant riposte. Like all good double acts, they were a good foil for each other. Very solid, he had ideas. And I wanted someone to look after youngsters at the time. Really, my right arm. What they were trying to build, Busby and Murphy, was not just the best team but the club itself. The best club in the world. I think this started when I was at Manchester City as a boy, 17 year old. I felt there was myself and probably two or three more were more involved with the club. We felt for the club. And I always had this in the back of my mind, to tell them they're coming to a club who would look after them. And from there, obviously, you try to build up. But for a club, they're gonna play football, they've got a good opportunity of playing it here. And the whole thing is trying to make the boys happy and enjoy themselves before they actually get signed on. He knew that what happens in the dressing room will reflect itself on the pitch. He saw as a player how older professionals who'd had bad experiences became bitter. They didn't train properly. They were corrupted. So there would be, in his club nobody who was damaged, nobody who was cynical, no rebels, nobody whispering behind the management's back. The first question, Matt, is how do you find these boys? Well, I'd say, Bill, I have a scouting system whose sole object is to go out looking for young promising schoolboys, youth club boys, and indeed any young players who have the necessary natural ability to make a future Manchester United player. He would do anything to get a young player he wanted. If it was Duncan Edwards, they'd pay the parents which was illegal at the time. If it was someone in Ireland, he'd come himself to Dublin. Ex-England captain Joe Mercer. He believes in catching 'em young so that ball control becomes instinctive. One day, I was talking with Joe Mercer. He had taken these schoolboys on, doing a bit of coaching with them. I said, "Joe, we're after a boy..." I can't remember the name of the boy. And Joe suddenly says to me, "The most outstanding player of them all is Duncan Edwards." And he says, "What's more," he says, "he's Manchester United mad." Every club in England wanted to Sign Duncan Edwards. Busby'd got him. Duncan Edwards in Dudley was brought out of bed during the night to sign a contract because Mr Busby was frightened of losing him to Wolves. I'm an Edwards fanatic. He was the most complete footballer I've ever, ever seen. He had strength, power in both feet. Hit 40 and 50 yard balls with consummate ease. Edwards was incomparable. We used to try and find faults with all our kids, you know. I could never find a weakness there. Colman, Eddie Colman. He only weighed about nine stone wet through, little Eddie. Tremendous player. He was a cheeky chappy. You know, he always had an answer to everything. And he was a great puller of women. I was captain of England Schoolboys so a lot of clubs were chasing me when I was 15. So I decided on United because of their great youth policy. I was first starting to play football and of course, every young player wants to improve and wants to be better. People used to tell me that Newcastle didn't have a good coaching system. It really was a hard place to live in those days. If you didn't work in the mines or the shipyards, you know, there wasn't really that much that you could work at. So if there was any opportunity, you know, you went, you travelled. Busby was very, very clever. You could only try and sign two schoolboys. He signed the players, the best in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. But his trick was, sign the young players and put them on the ground staff. You could have 11 on the ground staff. I did actually go at 15 and a half to work for Manchester United in the office. They came, we nurtured them, we watched them, we looked after them, they were coached. Great care was taken at the digs they were put in. The landladies were watching what went on. People would tell him. Fans would say, "I saw such-a-body out late last night," or whatever. And if he needed to tell you off, he'd say, "I want you in my office tomorrow morning at such a time." So you'd think, "Oh, blimey." And you'd spend all day and night worried about it. "Good manners. Don't insult people. "You're doing this, you're doing that." And he did guide us. He was just like a father to us. We were sort of all together type of thing. You become a sort of family, it was a family. The youth team, Jimmy Murphy always used to say, was the cream. Forget about the first team and the FA Cups and all that. This was the most important thing. I can remember, I wouldn't go to bed the night before a youth match because I'd been brainwashed, indoctrinated into thinking that this was the most important match that you ever played in your whole life. We won the Youth Cup every year I played. First five years of its existence was won by Manchester United. If you'd care to come and look at the boys, you're welcome. Thank you very much. Let me see Johnny Berry take a short corner which we use very often in the game. He passes it on to Bill Whelan who in turn turns it back. Well, obviously they can't all play in the first team but how do you keep them happy in the second team? Well, of course, Bill, we have no first team players at Old Trafford. They are all possible first team players. We'd had success at that time. I felt as though I had to do something to get young players going. Runners-up four times, then League champions in '52. And then Matt Busby brought on the Babes replacing eight of that championship side in one fell swoop. When I was just turned 16, I was playing for Manchester United's first team. Which was quite extraordinary. Well, I got my debut as a 17-year-old, you know, which was to me very special. And then I found out every other player at 17 had got promoted to the first team. Wilf was a good player but not in the same class as Bobby. But he made his debut about nine months before because my father kept Bobby back 'cos he didn't think Bobby was tough enough. My father would have him running around like an idiot to get out of breath. All the players used to say, "Until you actually play in the first division you don't realise how much you push yourself through pain barriers," which you never do in reserve team games. Bobby would say, "I'm knackered, I'm tired." And my father would say, "Well, you're not gonna die. Get running again." My right ankle was swollen up. It was quite painful. And I hadn't played in the reserves for a few weeks. And he called me up to his room and said, "I'm playing you in the first team tomorrow." If there's one time I didn't really want to play, it was that day. But he said, "Are you all right? Is your foot all right?" I said, "Yeah, it's all right." And suddenly the attention of the whole country was on Manchester United because they're playing babies, y'know, they can't possibly win anything. ♫ Now, football is a pleasant game ♫ It's played in the sun, played in the rain ♫ And the team that gets me excited? ♫ Manchester United ♫ Manchester ♫ Manchester United ♫ A bunch of bouncing Busby Babes ♫ They deserve to be knighted ♫ If ever they're playing in your town ♫ You must get to that football ground ♫ Take a lesson, come to see ♫ Football taught by Matt Busby ♫ Manchester ♫ Manchester United ♫ A bunch of bouncing Busby Babes ♫ They deserve to be knighted Luck has a lot to do with it. Like all good teams, there was just the right blend. And every great side have always had this. Roger was the captain so he was a bit above us. David Pegg, a Yorkshire lad, did his business. He was a good dribbler. He surprised us actually because we thought, "Yorkshire? Who are they?" But he was special. I think he dated me wife. Before she was me wife! Mr Busby, he wasn't frightened of spending money. But he only spent it when he had to. He paid £30,000 for Tommy Taylor from Barnsley. It was a record fee. So he had to live with that round his shoulders. If he had a bad 'un, we'd say, "You paid for him?" Y'know! A great, great centre-forward. We all felt that we were lucky to be a Manchester United player. And let's not kick it into touch, let's go about it and do it for him. Across to Berry it comes. The right wing, back on defence. Trying the offside game. Berry going through with it by himself. Across it comes, and oh, it's made a perfect hit. It's a goal! It's a goal. We all went out together, we went to dance halls, we went on holidays together. We were very, very fortunate to all join together. When Matt was growing up, he'd had a tough life. And I think he saw an enthusiasm, a vigour for life, for joy, and for fun. The mid-'50s were the early flowering of culture and excitement and leisure. And Harold MacMillan was saying, "You've never had it so good." And the Busby Babes were part of that flourishing of society, and the excitement and the youthfulness of a generation. The Busby Babes, the way they played was rock'n'roll. They weren't shackled by old ideas. They were inspiring. It was a wonderful place to be at, Manchester United, in those days. Terrific. A very distinct memory as a kid. They used to come to training on the bus. Paid players. Just the odd one would have a car. They'd go in the pub on a Saturday night, you know, for a drink. They were ordinary folk so the fans related to them. They saw them in the shop buying their cigarettes and sweets and newspapers. They represented what was then... what was then a working-class game and they represented those Mancunians. He'd say, "Those people have paid money to come and watch," you know. He'd give us a right volley. They were so far ahead, they were so new, they were so fit. They were so original. There was an air about them of invincibility. And they played on that. Nothing is more gratifying than to spot a star in a barrel and see him develop year by year to his predestined place among the gallery of the immortals. Last Christmas was the gayest and most abundant we have ever known. More to spend and more to buy. And young and old alike rejoiced to see the ration book go. When we won the championship of '56, I said to our board, "I'd like us to enter Europe." Next thing is we apply. The League Management Committee sent a letter to the club saying they didn't like the idea of us going in. Chelsea had won the League in 1955 and they were told it would conflict with the fixtures, so they backed off. Well, Mr Busby wasn't gonna be doing any backing off, thank you. I felt very strongly about it at the time. This is a new avenue to go into and... It was not a Scottish game, it was not an English game, it was not an Irish game, it was a world game. They were warned by the Football League, "If it interferes with your commitments, you will be punished severely." Included the possibility that United will be put out of the Football League. So I never doubted it for a moment, it was right because the old man said, "That's the way we've got to go and if we have to argue with our own football authorities, so be it." We had the meeting again. We just went on with it. It was a terrific, terrific time. There was no television. We didn't see Spanish football or French football or German football or whatever. So we... We went and played all these wonderful teams. It was all completely different. The roar was different. When somebody's had a shot, they just... "Whoosh!" Then a real blizzard hit United. Manchester was set for the semi-final. When you go abroad and play in these competitions, there's a great responsibility. You represent yourself, your club, your country, and... it's a very trying thing. Manchester United go to Madrid for the European Cup. English champions already, they now want to be European champions too. He wanted Manchester United to become England's Real Madrid and that was his dream. Matt had seen Real Madrid, how they could attract crowds of over 100,000 paying much more than the English customer would pay. The stadium was the first thing I noticed going over there. Tremendous stadium. I was one of the reserves. I was terribly pleased that I wasn't playing. You know, I saw Stéfano and I thought, you know, these things aren't human. You know, it's not the type of game that I'd ever been taught before. They beat us 3-1. It could have been two possibly, you know. But then we came back. There was so much atmosphere and so much tension in the city, and I suppose in the country, that by the time we came out to play them we started to fancy our chances a little bit if we could get an early goal. After 25 minutes, Kopa takes a pass in the penalty area and shoots a low one. So began nine minutes of dramatic, decisive soccer. Here's Madrid's second. Enzo passes, Rial shoots! Too easy. On come the floodlights for the second half. Manchester, four goals down in the aggregate, need a miracle to save them. Is this it? Pegg centres. Taylor does the rest. Another Pegg pass and Charlton scores a beauty. They've equalised! We only had about ten minutes left. And I can remember somebody fell over and was wasting time. And Duncan Edwards picked him up. He picked him up and didn't throw him but placed him off the pitch. It's a pity that such behaviour on both sides should spoil the brilliant football which gave Real Madrid their semi-final victory. Well, there are some memories, some pleasant memories actually. We've done a wonderful thing this year. They were young, just maturing. The year we were beaten by Real Madrid, the other year, it was due to inexperience, really. You were going places where people couldn't go in those days behind the Iron Curtain. People brought little stoves with them. Chocolate, anything to eat, something they could knock together quickly. Each player would have maybe a dozen hard-boiled eggs. Crazy when you think about it. And really the food wasn't too bad at all, really, it was OK. Manchester United have flown to the Yugoslav capital to play their return match with Red Star Belgrade, the champions of Yugoslavia. United only have to draw to make sure of a place in the European Cup semi-final, the round in which they were beaten last year. We'd travel away before a match, and Big Duncan used to say, "Go on, boys, we ain't come here for nuffin'!" N-U-F-F-I-N. This was always his famous saying before going out. And he's sticking his chest out, like... "This is what I want to do." Manchester United, the greatest team in post-war football, won their way through to the semi-final of the European Cup. I thought to myself, "Matt, you can sit back because everything that's possible to be want was there." After the match, you know, you were allowed to have a drink. We used to have a few drinks. Used to have more than enough, I must be honest. Enjoy the party, enjoy the banquet. And lads were lads. They had a drink. You'd been up all night whether you drank or not. We got to the airport the following morning, with our sore heads and tired heads. I only woke up when I heard everybody say, "Fasten your safety belts." And we'd come down. We were nearly on the runway before we knew it because it was what they call very low cloud base. They were under strict instructions from the Football League that they would be fined if they didn't arrive back in time to play their scheduled League game and they were grounded in Munich airport. We went up the runway once... and then come back. And we were still on the plane. Second time, we went along the runway. When we went back to the starting gate again, we were told to go into the cafeteria. And then about ten minutes, half an hour after that, there was an announcement. To proceed to the plane as the fault had been corrected. This eased everybody's mind now. And then it was just... tearing and darkness and daylight. I woke up and I was in my seat, still strapped in, but I was about 20 or 30 yards from the plane. Well, I was lucky I got out because my safety belt was broke. Just as I got to the outside of the plane, first person I saw was Billy Foulkes, Mr Foulkes here. And when I got out of the plane, the hoses, the firemen had arrived so I must have had a blackout. And the first person I saw when I got out who looked alive was Mr Busby. The others, everybody else, were unconscious. So I stayed with Mr Busby and tried to keep him warm, you know, I was rubbing his hands, just kept trying to keep him calm because he seemed to be in really bad shape, you know. Here is the news. So far we know there are 23 survivors after Manchester United's air crash at Munich this afternoon. Of the crew of six and 38 passengers on board, including a baby, these are the people so far known to have survived: of the Manchester United party, Matt Busby, manager, and the following players: Gregg, Wood, Foulkes, J Blanchflower, Morgans, Berry, Charlton, Viollet and Scanlon. I was... I'd be about 13 and I remember coming home from school and watching children's television and they broke in to the children's programme to say that there was a report that Manchester United plane had crashed at Munich. And Manchester was just in... in shock. And the first thing my mother says, "Oh, God, your father!" She thought he was on the plane. Because he should have been. And I said, "No, he hasn't gone." "He's in Wales." We get back from the Welsh match and I didn't know a dickie bird about this thing at all. Our secretary told me and I couldn't believe it. I cried like a child. Me dad went down to Old Trafford to see if he could help out. Well, we had no details and then as the details seeped out, the magnitude of the horror became apparent, yeah. What's your reaction to the news about Manchester United? It's a terrible shock to everybody concerned, players, wives, officials, everybody. There's nothing you can say about it, is there, really? I think it's the biggest tragedy Manchester's ever had. My dad went with Mrs Busby, Sandy Busby, and a few of the wives. They all flew out together. The Busby family were obviously petrified cos Matt was at death's door, really. He had the blessings of the dead. I was walking along in front, about ten yards in front of me mum, and I saw this old man in an oxygen tent. And he looked grey. And I thought, "Oh, that poor so-and-so," you know. And then it struck me. It was me dad. I had tremendous chest injuries. All my chest was all fractured and... My lung was pierced, and legs were broken and... First moment of something of consciousness, if you like... was one of the staff had said this one was dead. And momentarily I could understand that. But there were all sorts of... bodies around and... My wife who was there, I said to her, "You have to tell me what has happened." "This is making me worse." So I went on through the names... She either nodded her head or crossed her head like that. Tommy Taylor. David Pegg. Eddie Colman. Mark Jones. Billy Whelan. Geoff Bent. They're all... Er... Tragic loss, tragic loss... It's... Duncan was propped up in bed by pillows when Jimmy went up to the bed. He turned and he said, "What time's the kick-off, Jimmy?" My father phoned Billy Whelan's family from Munich to say that, sadly, "Your son's dead but he will never be forgotten." Life was very, very difficult for quite some time. I had some strange things happen. When I was getting a little better, they put me on one of the tables to try and get me some fresh air. I remember... as they pushed me through the door to... I screamed and screamed mad and they brought me back in again. I had the feeling that I might have been responsible. Why did I take the club into Europe? Why did we go the third time? And I felt that I wanted to die. I'd like to say a few words to my mother, I hope she's OK. - Yes. - And taking it well. She hasn't been down to see me, y'know, but it's a long way and I'm all right. I could have been a bit worse off like some of the others. When he signed a player, he made sure that the parents knew that he was gonna look after them. And suddenly this had happened. I'd missed this trip because of injury. It was very upsetting. It hurts to think about it. I have a corner of my mind that... they'll always be there. The night the coffins came home, there were thousands of people just standing on the street, watching the hearses go past. And most of them crying. People just sobbing their hearts out. Grown men, women. My mum and my aunt used to wash their shirts. Ten days later, they're polishing coffins. But nobody said, "Can you cope, ladies?" "Do you want any help or do you need to talk to somebody?" Cos there was nobody to talk to. Directors wanted to drop out of the League for the rest of the season because, y'know, "We can't cope with that." Dad said, "I can do this job." "No, we'll drop out." "No, I'll do it." He said, "Jimmy, keep the flag flying." I had this great empire that I was to run. Course, I only had two or three first-team players left. When the team sheets came out United's team sheet was completely and utterly blank. We know, Jimmy, that things have been a bit hectic for you these last few days. How do you think they're sorting themselves out now? Well, these things take time, Frank, as you know. We're in a terrible mess, really, with players and so forth. Right and obviously, Harry Gregg and Bill Foulkes have recovered from the experience of the Munich crash... Tell me, did you have any doubts about their selection? No, not in the slightest. They're both full of beans, on top of the world. My father persuaded Billy and Harry to play. Cos they weren't so keen cos they'd lost their mates, which you can understand. He said to 'em, "Billy Foulkes, I need a captain and you're him." And Billy Foulkes said, "I don't want to do it and I can't do it." And Dad said, "You can do it and you will do it." And that was it. And they got off the train and they're walking along. "Have you got a quote for us, Jimmy?" And he said, "Yes. If you don't get out my way, I'll piss on your shoes." I had a job, you know, to keep the tears back as we're playing. Billy Foulkes, number two, now their captain, won the toss. The best thing that happened to me was to get down to Old Trafford, to kick and fight and argue and do these things or I would definitely have lost it up there. Harry Gregg goes into action. One morning, and it was after we'd played Sheffield Wednesday, I couldn't find the paper. And then I found out why I couldn't find the paper. It was because Duncan had died. Ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking from my bed in the Isar hospital in Munich Where I have been since the tragic accident of just over a month ago. You will be glad, I'm sure, to know that the remaining players here and myself are now considered out of danger. And I am delighted to hear of the success and united effort made by all at Old Trafford. For it is only this last two or three days that I have been able to be told anything about football. And I enclose my best Wishes to everyone. And finally may I just say, God bless you all. Matt Busby's reborn Babes. Sure that disaster cannot quench their fighting spirit. It was a very traumatic time for the club. I was in a position of responsibility that I had to take. My life was never the same. So when they came back, they wanted them to get playing as quickly as possible and catch up with their matches. We played West Brom in the sixth round of the FA Cup. And we beat them after a replay at Old Trafford in the last minutes of extra time. Busby's miraculous Babes, six weeks from a disaster which stunned the footballing world, are determined to reach Wembley or bust. Bobby Charlton and out to the right wing. Back again to Charlton who runs in for the shot and leaves Macedo helpless. So the astonishing Babes have done it again! And it's to be an all-Lancashire Cup Final. And... I can feel getting better and better as time went on. But... The crunch was coming back to... to England. I'd overcome the biggest obstacle. And, er... Well,... it was a slow, slow, slow process. It was the start. Wembley's Empire Stadium is certainly a very powerful magnet on the great day. A hundred thousand or so were there and they fairly cheered Matt Busby, who'd recovered sufficiently to be present, as his Manchester United men came out beside their white-shirted opponents Bolton Wanderers. Then Bobby Charlton sets the ball rolling and the match of the season is under way. Well... I was bent a little. I was terrified to come and look at the ground and feel the people. I forced myself to do it. I forced myself, I had to do it. Less than three minutes have passed when Bryan Edwards puts in a perfect cross and Nat Lofthouse does the rest. It's a goal! Fizzer from Charlton, comes back off the post into Hopkinson's arms. But two minutes later, the hard shot from Stevens is held by Gregg and Lofthouse puts him and the ball into the net. Bolton Wanderers have certainly earned congratulations for their fourth Wembley win, while Manchester United deserve the highest praise for reaching Wembley against all odds. When he came back, he was on crutches. And you'd go and meet him at the door and he'd go upstairs through the directors' door, up the stairs, and he would give you his crutches while he forced himself to walk down the passage using the wall. I'll never forget the first time we all met him again. We were all assembled in the dressing room and he looked at us all, tears came in his eyes and he just walked out. We understood what... We knew what he was going through. He just was looking at faces that weren't there. I was told, "Don't upset yourself, get out and play for them," and that sort of thing. They wanted that. They wanted us to remember them on the field. My first reaction was never to have anything to do with football again. My wife said, uh, "Well, the lads that have died would want you to carry on." And it... it struck a note. And from there, I started thinking that way. And there's the cheers of the crowd as Matt Busby returns once again to Old Trafford and takes his dutiful seat, the manager's seat. And everyone knows how much he's been looking forward to getting back to Old Trafford to see his team in action. And... it was a good job I went back and forced myself to go back because I become occupied and I got this obsession again... that Manchester United were going to the top. A crowd of well over 30,000. Matt Busby looking on as critically as ever to see how his team is performing. And next the cameras go out to the Cliff training ground and here we meet the new Manchester United, the youngest of the Busby Babes, the reserve men whom fate has suddenly made first team men. We got so many problems in trying to create a new Manchester United. It was a very harassing time. You couldn't wait for young people to build your young team again. It meant actually that I could try to enter the transfer market and try and buy one or two players that I felt would help us through this particular period. My father joined United just after the war. Matt was a tracksuit manager. When I played, you never saw Matt. I joined in 1960 and there were five years post-Munich when the training ground was a kind of sterile place. Busby was notable by his absence. No, when I say, with the situation of Denis, Denis is the... the stumbling block at the present time. If he's... I remember Noel saying to me, "Is this it?" I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Is this the great Manchester United?" Well, I was 12th man for the first team. On the coach, a piece of paper was passed down. It was a cartoon of Busby with the words "Bollock Chops". It was a shock to me but it was the way the senior players were thinking. Someone like Bobby Charlton would resent some of the people who came in. But the Manchester United dream was dying, if not dead. There was a tremendous turnover of players coming in, going out, shuffling right, left and centre. Well, I wanted Denis Law as a boy. He was at Huddersfield at the time and... I went to Andy Beattie who was the manager then and said, "Look, I'll give you £10,000 for this young blond elf." "No, Matt," he said, "we think we've got something." And Andy Beattie was right because they had something. I bumped into Mr Busby in those days. And he said to me, he said, "How's things going in Torino or whatever?" You know, I said, "Well, really, not good, really." "It's... The football's rubbish, really." I eventually bought him from Torino. They were offering £115,000 for him. That was cheap at the price. For all these magnificent goals, a magnificent player. It was cheap at the price. He used to rise so majestically and he'd stay there and head these balls so well. Ah, and he was so courageous, you know, no matter who they were or what they were, how big they were. Sometimes the big ones would maybe clatter him. "I can't promise you I won't kick 'em back." I said, "All right, all right, but keep out of trouble as well." That fair-haired genius, Denis Law. The first time I ever met Matt Busby was '61 or '62. We thought, "God almighty, that's Matt Busby." His instinctive eye for talent brought Pat Crerand to Old Trafford. I came just beginning of February '63 and the team weren't doing particularly well. We'd signed Pat Crerand and we'd signed Law that year. Played at Leicester one time and Law scored a hat-trick. But we lost 4-3. However way we played, we just couldn't win. There was a nine-week period where we had snow and frost and there were no games played. And trying to catch up on all the fixtures, we just couldn't get it right. We were drifting down and not seeming to get the results. The men were coming in after the match and saying, "What have we got to do to win a match?" See the Saints get the game going. Top star of Southampton, Terry Paine, soon shows sparkling form on the right. Early on, he's on the warpath. That year, we had almost been relegated. We finished about sixth or seventh from the bottom. And the Cup, it was like a release, the Cup. A well-placed centre, Denis Law just manages to connect. Goal! It's all over. Manchester United 1, Southampton 0. It's United versus Leicester City in the final. Inside the stadium, 100,000 fans ready to raise that new roof. With the arrival of Her Majesty, the preliminaries reach their climax. The gladiators entering the arena. He did say, Matt Busby, that it would take five years for the club to be really established as a real football power again. We were outsiders and it suited us with the quality of players we had. The day of a big game, they would come through. He shoots, it goes to Herd and it's in the net! The fulfilment of an English footballer's ambition. The Cup and a Cup medal. It's a moment of triumph for their manager Matt Busby. Proof that he has most successfully rebuilt United. The milk companies that sponsored the Cup Final... We had plenty bottles of milk they had in the dressing room. No champagne. Milk, we were drinking! Mr Busby, third time lucky, what do you feel about it? Well, I think it's a wonderful thing for myself, for the club, the players, and everything else because these boys have got it in them, and of course they've shown it today and I'm very, very pleased indeed. Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt! Hold it up! Up high! Smile. Come on, smile! How one game can change a football team! The Cup was a big, big affair. It was a massive affair worldwide in '63. It changed Manchester United. So that gave us a lift to think we could do anything. Very pleased to meet you and welcome to Old Trafford. I'm Matt Busby, the manager of Manchester United. All you boys follow me, I'll take you down to the dressing room. Right? Manchester United last year confirmed the old saying, "Lousy in the League, lucky in the Cup." But Denis Law for one has other ideas for this year. It was the start of a season. These two boys had come over from Belfast. And watching them playing and carrying on, I come back with the opinion that there was someone there who had extraordinary talent. But he was still a boy at 15 years of age. Played for Cregagh Boys Club. And Manchester United decided me for trials. And at first when I went over, I only stayed a couple of days, and I was homesick and came back home. But my father, he had a talk with Matt Busby and he decided to give me another chance. To McCreadie. My, his approach to the ball, it was uncanny. He had obviously this tremendous balance, for a boy. When I brought him into the side, 17 year old. George was like Edwards. Best didn't need coaching at all. Amazingly, I find it quite easy to play in the First Division. Y'know, I don't have to train hard. Y'know, I don't have to work at anything, it must be just natural ability. Wriggling out space. What a fine set! Sir Matt had always advocated that you went forward, you were good players, make sure that you perform to your best and don't be afraid to express yourself. Manchester United have now won six League games on the trot. They're in the form to go through, get into Europe for the first time since the 1957-58 season. And because of that, George felt that he could beat six or seven people if he wanted. Denis could try acrobatic overhead kicks and things like that. I could maybe try to shoot from distances that was really stupid. I was in the middle of the park with Bobby Charlton. Nobby was defending along with Billy Foulkes and Shay Brennan and Tony Dunne. They were two attacking full-backs. We just clicked. It was a great attacking team, it was always going forward. Here we are on the last Saturday of the Football League season and still, any one of three teams can win the First Division Championship. So after European games, in the early '60s, teams would often stay over and we would go after the match to the Midland dressed up a dinner, a dinner... a cabaret. And at two o'clock in the morning, we'd be doing the conga around the corridor and who would lead the conga? Mr and Mrs Busby. Brilliant. Be it Old Trafford, the home of League champions Manchester United. There, Matt Busby is really the boss. He's the only manager in the Football League to have held his job for 20 years and he's made United England's most successful post-war club. As a manager, what is his approach? Today I regard football as big business. Many years ago, a few years ago, there was a certain amount of sport in it. One might say there's sport there just now, but not to the extent... It is business and you've got to produce, and results count. Because after all, end of a season, football clubs must show profit of some kind. In the early '60s, Sir Matt brought a successful businessman into the club. Louis Edwards worked in the meat industry in Manchester. Big United fan, and a friend of Matt Busby's. Louis brought with him a business acumen that was non-existent then. The reminders of his first great team are all around him. The young Charlton is now a great player. Billy Foulkes is as firm and reliable as ever. Harry Gregg, older and wiser, still the first-choice goalkeeper. Pat Crerand and also Denis Law epitomise a somewhat different policy now. These then were the foundations on which Busby built his second football team. He's put them in the setting of a new £300,000 stand and a ground that's had a million pounds spent on it in the 20 years of his managership. He has rebuilt not only a club but a reputation. But practical rewards from a satisfied board of directors have been a one-ninth share in Manchester United and a seat on the board when he feels that he's ready to take it. United were the first club in the country to introduce private boxes at the stadium. And that was a business decision taken jointly by Sir Matt and Louis Edwards. They saw that there was a market for this. But the will was then that, between them, they had mates who could buy all the boxes anyway. For Busby and United, the wheel has turned full circle and again they're in the European Cup. In their first leg quarter-final match against Benfica, their fluid, freewheeling game brought them a 3-2 victory. It was a triumph for Busby the tactician. I think generally we are a better side. If our boys play as they can play, - I feel we'll beat them. - You have to beat them, Matt. I'm wondering whether there's anything left really for you to prove. I still want Manchester United to be the best team in Europe. And the only way they can be the best team in Europe is by winning the European Cup. You know the fans wanted to win, but it was for him. He was that popular with the players. And of course they didn't want to let him down. Just had that bit of magic that got you to... You wanted to win for him more than anything else. Denis Law and the rest of Matt Busby's men attack. After seven minutes, the ball went to George Best. Goal! Here comes Best again! What a player this boy is! He's got another! What a player! ♫ And your feet play tricks like a juggler ♫ As you weave to the sound of your name ♫ Georgie, Georgie ♫ They call you the Belfast Boy ♫ Georgie, Georgie ♫ They call you the Belfast Boy He's already a hero throughout the world of football. Like Matthews and Pelé and Eusébio, this is a name that will put 10,000 on the gate wherever he plays. I think maturity in the next two or three years will make him probably the most complete player. I realise, you know, I know sometimes I go a bit beyond, you know, what I should... my limits. Because at the moment, training and football is not a strain to me. Y'know, I enjoy training. But I think maybe three, four years... You can't burn a candle at both ends. Which I admit I have done. ♫ Georgie, Georgie ♫ They call you the Belfast Boy ♫ Georgie, Georgie ♫ They call you the Belfast Joy ♫ And they say Georgie, Georgie, keep your feet on the ground ♫ Georgie, Georgie, when you listen to the sound ♫ Georgie, Georgie, put... Do you think that present-day footballers are very much overpaid? It seems to be sort of out of all proportion. Well, I really think every man should be paid according to his ability. I must say that I've never objected to paying very big wages to a lot of the Manchester United players because they had the ability to do something and the ability to win something and the ability to pull crowds. With the abolition of the maximum wage in the early '60s, players could have earned a lot more at other clubs. The only player, Bobby Charlton told me once... He said, "The boss called me. He said, 'Do you want a rise, Bobby?"' And never heard of that before. I know that Denis Law went for a rise. He didn't get it. And why did he do it? Upbringing, man of his age... "You're worth £25 a week. You don't get £25 a week till I think you're worth £25 a week." And he was... he was tight. United managed to hold down the wage bills at Old Trafford. Players like George Best and Bobby Charlton and Denis Law were playing for the prestige and the glory and the reputation. It's a goal! Oh, a beautiful goal! Are United going to lose their semi-final of the Champions Cup? You have lost to one or two rather moderate sides. I'm thinking of Partizan last year. Well, last year, I thought we were sure to win it, beaten Benfica and played so magnificently. I rather think it give us a false impression. And the semi-final we played Partizan, I think we rather took the view that we'd just got to go on the field and play and pick up the semi-final and go into the final. I think it was... this I think was the reason why we lost. You are reputed of course to be looking for one or two players now, to improve and sort of develop your squad a bit. Is that right? Well, of course, we bought Alex Stepney, the goalkeeper. We seemed to be losing a lot of goals and I think he's tightened up the defence considerably. I mean, I'm asking really, will you ever really win the great, uh...? Oh, a good bit of football by Aston to Crerand. To Sadler, is this number four? Yes! This is another great day in the history of Manchester United. And now the Stretford End is up. Winning the League was obviously fantastic. It put us in the European Cup. It was probably Matt's last chance ever to win the European Cup. To Kidd, a beautiful move, this. Three players in the middle. Burns... Great save! And it's there! Aston the scorer! Johnny Aston, the son of a former Manchester United international, gets the vital goal. And Manchester United are through into the next round. Aston... Again, the queue at the far post for the cross if he can get it back. It went well for him. Best! We won 1-0 at Old Trafford in the first leg. We went to Madrid. We've gone out there thinking, "Well, if we can get to 0-0 at half-time, we've got a chance." It's a goal! One minute's gone in this match, the crowd erupts. Oh! Gento goes absolutely clear. Brennan never made contact. And it's the second goal, and poor Shay Brennan! Own goal! It's an own goal! What an astonishing thing! There was no danger. Gento trying to blast it through... And another goal! The half-time score, 3-1 to Real Madrid and 3-2 they lead on aggregate. We went in that dressing room, "What you doing? You're supposed to be out there attacking teams, you've done it all..." Laughing! He says... "Semi-final... Go out and enjoy yourselves!" "You've let me down, you've let the supporters down, you've let the club down." The match is so tense, it's produced such an atmosphere, you could almost touch it. Best. Oh! And it's Sadler and it counts. Everybody can't believe it! It looked for a moment as if he might have handled it, but the goal's given and Manchester United are very much back in this European Cup. Best has made the space well. Shoots... Foulkes, he scores! Bill Foulkes, the man who's played right through Manchester United's European Cup campaign! Foulkes, of all people, poaching on the edge of the box! And what a good goal it was, too! Set up by George Best and Manchester United could be on the way to the final! No other memory of him scoring a goal and then he actually side-footed the ball into the goal. I can't remember him side-footing anything, you know. They've done it! Yes, they've done it! Manchester United have gone into the final of the European Cup. And Bobby Charlton's fallen right over. He's lying flat. I'm not quite sure if he's fainted or what or whether he's crying but Bobby Charlton is face down on the pitch. What a moment this is for Matt Busby and Manchester United. And Bobby Charlton who's played right so far through all of Manchester United's European Cup matches, overcome right at the last moment. Bobby, you've won every honour of the game but it's not come easily to you. Now I remember a long time ago, sitting in the Wembley dressing room alongside you, it was 1958, just after Munich, and you were crying that day. Do you remember? You sat in the dressing room and you'd got a loser's medal again and I remember you saying to me, "Oh, well, y'know, this is another loser's medal," kind of thing. And I suddenly had a feeling that it was gonna happen to you again in a sense. - Did you feel that? - No. I've got over that now. I expect to lose sometimes but I shall be more disappointed if we lose the next one. - Yes. - You know, but we'll give them a run. The pair of you have been right through the United campaign ever since, you know... But I felt I always had something driving me on. Pushed myself a lot further. 'Cos I felt I had to win that European Cup. We all said, "We must win the European Cup because that's what the lads died trying to achieve." And there's Coluna, and Manchester United on the far side. Maybe the hottest and most humid day that I've ever known in England. The sweat was pumping out of us. Alex Stepney, Brian Kidd, and a happy 19th birthday to him. The unmistakeable figure of George Best. And John Aston, his proud father is here to watch him today. Bill Foulkes, who's played in every European Cup campaign for Manchester United. The only player to have done so. One of the greatest servants Manchester United are ever likely to have. Pat Crerand. A lot of people say he's a one-pace player but he's an immaculate passer of the ball. Thirteenth European Cup final and there is Matt Busby. And how most people in this stadium, and I'm sure in the television audience, are praying for him at this moment. I've never known such tension in Wembley Stadium before. This is a tremendous, emotional occasion. Game under way and it's Manchester United kicking off in the dark shirts, the dark blue shirts, attacking the goal on your left. Aston again leaving Adolfo miles behind. Watch Kidd on the far post! Now Sadler! For Aston, what a good ball, too! Fine try by Johnny Aston there. Matt Busby must be wondering whether that was an important one went away. For Sadler... Charlton... It's there! Bobby Charlton! Bobby Charlton makes it 1-nothing! That's his 20th goal in the European Cup competition. Eusébio and now Graça! It's 1-1! Graça, Jaime Graça. Simões breaking for Benfica. And Eusébio going through the middle... What a tremendous save! - Stepney! - Wonderful keeping by Stepney there! He came right out and narrowed that angle. The only way it could go in was over the top! And the whistle goes for the end of 90 minutes. The second time in the history of the European Cup that there has been extra time. We now are going to the first period of 15 minutes. Now Best. Oh, he's got a great chance! Oh, he must! He has! Georgie Best has done it! Two minutes of extra time gone and Georgie Best makes it 2-1. And that was a tremendous save! Kidd! Kidd it is, number eight! It's Charlton in the middle, so too is Aston. Charlton... Another! He's got another! Is it all over? No. Yes, it is! It's all over! Manchester United have done it! Where, oh, where is the man everyone thinks of? Matt Busby, tremendous moment for this great man. The man that they would have for prime minister, president and everything. When teams win something, you go to the nearest player. I don't think one of us, not one of us, went to our nearest player. We all went to Bill Foulkes, to Bobby Charlton and Matt Busby. It was never rehearsed. We've waited a long, long time for this. Manchester United are the European Champions. Well done, Manchester United. That night at Wembley was a crowning glory for us all. It was a night of achievement. It was the object, the exercise from the start. And with the tragedy... there was joy that night. We've got here the boys who've done us proud last night. The boys who have won honour for the club. They've won honour for Manchester, they've won honour for England. I'm very proud to be the manager of these lads who have done such a wonderful job. Finally, up the Reds! Up the Reds! So, as Sir Matt receives his accolade, doubters will still ask, since he's already known and revered by every football fan in the country, what does the tap on the shoulder and the use of a "sir" before his name really add up to? How did your mother react when this boy from the pitman's cottage became Sir Matt Busby? I know it made her a very proud woman. She sent a telegram: "Dear Sir Matt Boss." - Which is... - That's sweet! - She must have been very, very thrilled. - Oh, yeah. - Good morning, everyone. - Morning. "Sir Matt has informed the board that he wishes to relinquish the position of team manager at the end of the present season. The chairman and directors have tried to persuade him to carry on and it was only with great reluctance that his request has been accepted." One, take one. This is a job you really wanted, isn't it? Er... Well, yes. It's something you dream about. I've dreamt about now and again. I was so proud that he chose me. And I'll always be proud of that, you can't take that away, that I was the one he chose. Sir Matt, you appear to have given Wilf McGuinness all the responsibilities of team manager without the actual title. Is there a reason for this? I've listened to his observations at matches and half-time match, and so on. And I thought, "Well, that's exactly the way I felt about it." We were all amazed that Wilf McGuinness got the job in actual fact. I think Wilf might have been surprised as well. Will you stress to the present players - that he has full authority? - Oh, yes. Oh, yes. What would be your reaction should he drop George Best? If he feels he's dropped George Best, that's Wilf McGuinness' business. He dropped Bobby, he dropped Denis, he dropped me, he dropped George, he dropped Paddy, he dropped everybody, to make a point. He was infantile in his approach. And he had this... if you got caught with your hands in your pockets, you had to do ten press-ups. It was cold, raining, muddy. We were all in tracksuits. And Bobby in his suit, he's got his hands in his pocket. And Wilf said, "Oh, Bobby, you know the rules, ten press-ups." And there was silence. And he did them. He did them. I think Wilf got sacked the day after. At last night's meeting, when young Wilf's job of team manager was relinquished, the directors asked me if I'd go in and take over for the time being. The club is the thing and in view of that, I just come in as a part-timer. We won the European Cup in 1968. Everything since that seems to have been an anti-climax. Who do you blame? I... I would think it stems from the fact that United were on top for so long that unless you're in a position to recognise it and recognise that you need change, that you're gonna fail. I was 22. I wasn't going to reach my peak for another seven or eight years. And I listened to everyone talking about how this is it, we've achieved what we set out to achieve. And it seemed like they were talking as if it was all over. I was only starting, which hurt me, y'know, because Manchester United had been my whole life. When I came out, I was going to enjoy a peaceful life and enjoy watching Manchester United play but it hasn't been that way. How much of a crisis is Manchester United in at the moment? Well, everyone that's struggling at the bottom of the League has a crisis on their hands. Do you feel the board can accept any blame at all? I don't think so. Lee. Pulled across for Law! Denis has done it! But no elation there at all from Denis Law. So that presumably is the end of the game. And the end of Manchester United's 36 years unbroken run in the First Division. Was he very impossible to replace? I don't think anybody's impossible to replace really. The person who takes over will have to be just equally as good, I'm afraid. This must be an inhibiting effect on those who try to succeed you. I can't understand that. Applications are invited from managers with experience and proven ability. It was always there, you know, this overpowering bearing on the place, y'know, that you could never get away from. Until Alex. Success is positively demanded at Old Trafford and the fact that it is now 20 seasons since Manchester United won the championship has ultimately cost Ron Atkinson his job. The Scot becomes the sixth to try to follow Sir Matt Busby. He's Lanarkshire. I'm from Govan. There's a difference. We were 17, 18 when the Busby Babe comparisons started to come out. It's the chance of a lifetime. A treble chance, the likes of which no English team has had before or may ever get again. Sir Alex instilled into us what Sir Matt had in his teams. Entertaining football, getting the fans off their feet with that working-class mentality that even if you were having a bad game, you would always put a shift in. Three added minutes. Can Manchester United score? They always score. - The big goalie's coming up. - Peter Schmeichel is forward. Can he score another in Europe? - He's got one in Europe already. - Beckham. In towards Schmeichel. It's come for Dwight Yorke! Clear. Giggs with a shot! Sheringham! Is this their moment? Beckham. Into Sheringham. And Solskjaer has got it! Manchester United are the champions of Europe again and nobody will ever win a European Cup final more dramatically than this. Oh, it'll all be rushing back to him now. Feel a sense of romance. Wonder. Mystery. A sense of beauty. And a sense of poetry. Because on such occasions, the game is larger than life. There's something of the timeless, magical quality of legend.
