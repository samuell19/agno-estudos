Judy Jenkins Marketing, please. Judy Jenkins in Marketing, line three. I'm on deadline here, Lester. Of course you are, dear. City Mag's Blue Ribbon Gems, right? No, no, no. I changed it to "How to get a hot bod for the new year." Fabulous. Will it be ready for the January issue? - Of course. - If you leave her alone, Lester. Don't you have nine holes somewhere or Christmas shopping to do? And miss the office party? Why don't you go work on your Yuletide speech to the minions. They do love to hear from me, don't they? Um-hum. Thank you, you are a life saver. But can I pass on the party? Um... your loss. There'll be tons of hot guys there. I need a remedy for my frigid sheets since I kicked George to the curb. Diane, George dumped you, remember? He was romantically challenged with commitment phobia. So, while I'm at the party, falling in lust, you will be...? Shopping for a Christmas tree with Tom and Jonathan. Ah, unconditional love, and don't I hate you for it. Great practice, J.J. Nice move on the goalie. Yeah, well, like you showed me, Dad. Would someone help me untangle these? - Sure. - Yeah. When are we going to go get our tree? Soon as we get our decorations hung. Oooh. Oh, hey. This star's been in our family for generations. Um-hum. Someday you'll be putting it on your own tree with your own kids. Hey. I don't mind if I do. And I don't mind if you do. - Let's get a tree! - Okay. Yeah. Let's go. C'mon, c'mon. Did you guys get any presents today? Merry Christmas. Oh, Merry Christmas to you, son. Merry Christmas, Santa. Ah... there. - What about these, Jon? - Those are the skates, Dad. Well, put them on your list. We'll see what Santa can do. Um-hum. Come on. Do you think we'll make it to the finals this season, Dad? If everybody's willing to work at it. I'm gonna. What are we going to do about our goalie? Willy never met a cheeseburger he didn't like. TOM! WATCH OUT! Hey. How're you feeling, honey? - Where's Jonathan? - He's right here. He's fine. You have some bruises, but the doctor says you're going to be okay. Um... where's Tom? Is he all right? Tom didn't make it, honey. Okay. Mom? Life doesn't always turn out the way you plan it, Sue. I am so sorry. Wait for the goalie to commit. NOW! Bill... Ahem... bill. Oh, a designer shoe sale. Susan! Are you kidding me? Oh, great, 'mortgage payment overdue'. - Time for school. - Um-hum. Okay. Well, your juice is in your lunch box. - I made you a sandwich. - What kind? - Peanut butter and jelly. - I hate peanut butter and jelly. Well, Jonathan, I didn't have time to get to the market. That's what you said yesterday. Well, you will survive. Jonathan... Jonathan! Mom, what happens to someone after they die? Well, if they're a loving person, angels will come down to meet them, and then they'll take them to be back with God. Do you believe there's some kind of life for a person after they die? This is about your dad, isn't it? - Yeah. - Okay, listen. I understand that you want to hang on to him. There is no one in the world who would want him back more than me, right? It stinks. It's not fair. And I... I know how you feel. But the truth is, he is gone and you and I have to adjust to that. That's what Dad told me last night. Last night? He said, "Life doesn't always turn out the way you plan it." You're listening to the Road Show on WKRZ. Let me remind you. Get together... ...sign up for our WKRZ 'Under The Mistletoe' dating service. We're looking for you. We're going to get you... We lived in a fairy tale, honey, it wasn't reality. You know, your father... Don't say anything bad about dad. I'm not going to say anything bad about your dad. I adored him. But... Look, there're some things that you're just too young to understand, okay? Now listen, you need to do something for me. You have to stop telling people that you speak with him. - But I do. - But you don't, honey. - It's absolutely impossible. - No, it's not! WE TALK ALL THE TIME! Okay, well where do you speak with him? How? - He's just there. - Where? IN MY ROOM! Other places. He's like... there when he wants to be. He's says he's going to miss us on Christmas. JONATHAN, STOP IT! STOP. J.J. listen, honey. I'm, uh... I'm going to pick you up after hockey, okay? - I don't want to go. - Well, you can't miss hockey practice if you want to be on the team. I'M NOT GOING! Jonathan...! Oh... damn. Eeeyah! Damn. Damn it. Don't you look where you're going? You just drove right into me. I hit you?! You pulled out without even looking! I did not. All I did was... was... - Talking on your cell phone. - Oh, is that a sexist remark? No, No. That was an observation. Well, you know what? There's nothing like meeting a gentleman. Or, one could say, running into one. Purrrrfectly lovely. You know what? Let's just forget this ever happened. Wait. Wait. Wait. So... so you're leaving the scene of an accident. Lady, there's no damage to your car. Quit while you're ahead. Oh... Damn. What else can go wrong with my life? Carpal tunnel syndrome? 'Cause my granny types faster than that. Yeah, ask your granny how exciting she can make the Victorian Revival. Lunch will perk you up. Andy's bringing a hot friend. I don't need someone hot. If I start dating again I need someone who understands kids. Jonathan still claims he's having conversations with Tom. I'm having a hideous day, Diane. Some guy rammed his car into me at school. Oh? Is he cute? - Who? - The guy you rammed. How would I even know? I was sipping my coffee. I was checking my messages when... I guess I rammed into him. Not a felony, unless you're putting your makeup on at the same time. I was lucky that no one was hurt, Diane. Listen, tell me something. Be honest. I know I haven't been delivering lately. Am I in trouble with Lester? Oh. You know how he is. Everybody's only as good as their next story. Oh, just a sec. Diane Holmes. All right. Ship the proofs to my assistant and I'll take a look. Okay. Bye. So, uh... I got to go. Hi, looneytunes. Talking to yourself again? - I'm talking to my dad. - Yeah? So, where is he? - Leave me alone, Butch. I want to know where your father is. HEY! Hey! Enough! Break it up. - Break it up, break it up. - Ooompph! All right. QUIT IT! Hi. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Don't worry. I can hold off Lester. Oh, it's not Lester. It's not the deadline. It's me. Some days I wonder, you know, why bother getting up? Or eating or breathing. None of what happens makes any sense. Does anybody's life makes sense? I mean it's all so random. You survived the crash. It could have been the other way around. Maybe it would have been better that way. My future's gone, Diane. I lost my dreams. I lost the one man who made me feel like I could fly. But mostly, I am so damn angry at him... for leaving me. You know, when my sister died, I learned that you shouldn't be afraid to be angry, or to cry. But you know what? You also have the God-given right to be happy again. Starting today. Excuse me. Susan Chandler. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm on my way. I've got to go. There's a problem with Jonathan at school. Are you all right? The kid was making fun of me. I had to sock him. Oh, Jonathan. All right, well, the principal wants me to talk to your counselor. I'll be right back. That's some right hand, bud. I shouldn't have punched him, I know. Afterwards I was looking for you and I didn't know where you were. Well, I'm still trying to figure out how all this spirit stuff works. It didn't come with an owner's manual. Mrs. Chandler. Kevin Harrison. Yeah. Well, this uh... this is embarrassing. Now you've, uh... you've calmed down, right? 'Cause I've already taken a right hook from one member of your family today. So... - Wait, Jonathan... - Popped me. When I tried to break up a fight between him and another boy. Oh, god. Well, um... I apologize for Jonathan's behaviour, and mine, this morning. I let my emotions get in the way. Um... Please. You'll have to excuse the mess. My first day was Monday. And between hockey practice and moving in, it's taking me a while to get settled. Oh, you have a child on the team? No. I'm the new coach. Well, what happened to Coach Bennett? Retired. I was teaching at Seaver and felt this was a good opportunity to work with younger kids. Is that your wife? Yes. - Well, she's lovely. - Thank you. Look, Mr. Harrison. Umm... Jonathan has never been a problem at school before. I just want you to know that. This morning aside, his teacher is spending an inordinate amount of time trying to get Jonathan into the normal class routine. He marches to his own drummer. Well, I admit he can be strong-willed, but I don't know how that... He's also very sensitive. You might think about looking into a child psychologist. A psychologist? Well, I thought this was just about a schoolyard fight. This is about the voices Jonathan hears. He told you that? He told me he talks with his father, yes, who, as I understand... Yeah, my husband died in an accident a year ago. But I don't see how Jonathan would need a psychologist. Forgive me, Mrs. Chandler. This is not about what you think. This is about what the school thinks. This is a private institution and the powers that be don't want the other children upset. Well, you're his counselor, Mr. Harrison. Don't you think you can do something to help? I'm trying, but you don't seem to be listening. I'm listening loud and clear. So, how come I can see you and no one else can? I'm a spirit, Jon. And uh... it's because you believe that you can see me. That you can see what other people can't. Okay. Well, what about Mom? She loves you. She misses you. Why can't she see you? Well, for one thing, she's mad at me. She can't see past that. Well, she's mad at the world. So... where do you go after? You know, to heaven or what? - It's kind of complicated. - You always say that when you don't want to explain everything to me. - Like sex. - Okay. Busted, yeah. Um... You see, my physical body may have been taken but... I'm still here. Death, it's uh... it's just a transition to another plane. What's that mean? It means I'm kind of stuck in limbo here, which means I'm neither here nor there. When Jonathan's father was here, his whole life was about hockey. Yeah, I saw his name on the roster. He told me he wasn't interested in playing this year. Well, I'm at my wits end. Is there anything that you can do? Well, I'll tell you what. I will keep an eye on him while we all try and get through the holidays. And the door is open if he wants to return to the team. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you. When you're ready I know the team would welcome you back. I don't want to play anymore. Well, you love hockey, sweetheart. I thought for Christmas I'd get you those skates that you didn't get last year. I don't want anything for Christmas. Well, we can't have Christmas without exchanging gifts. Christmas isn't about gifts. Then what is it about, Jonathan? Believing. You know something? You need to grow up and stop pretending. Tough day, huh? Me and mom aren't getting along. She just doesn't know what she wants from one minute to the next. Well, not only is she your mom, she's a woman. They're not so easy to understand, sometimes. Why does this all had to happen, Dad? We were so happy together. I just want things to be like they were before. Hey, uh... I did not want to leave you and your mom behind. I promise you that. But, why is she always so angry? Jon, um... I found it's possible to try and do all the right things and still end up with a bad result. I, uh... you know, I really wanted to be a good husband, - a good father and... - Dad, what are you saying? You're the best. Thanks. That means a lot to me, Jon. But there are some things that I fell down on. I... I kept meaning to get more life insurance. What's that? It's money. For you and your mom in case anything ever happened to me. It'd pay bills, pay for the mortgage on this house. And, you know, I put it off. I... I thought I had more time. I just didn't... I didn't leave her a very good hand to play. Well, I know I'm causing her more problems than I should. But, you know, I'm just a kid. You know, Jon, well, you needed some stability, yeah, and uh... she needs a man around the house. She doesn't even want to date. Okay. Well, um... We're just going to have to help her along with that then, right? It's getting a little sleepy-eyed right now. What a night. Christmas cheer all around. I want to remind all you night owls out there - It's time to remind you - the unattached gals and guys out there listening right now, sign up for the WKRZ 'Under The Mistletoe' dating search. We're looking for you. And we're going to find you. "Meet your soulmate, and win fantastic prizes, and prize money." Mom, I was thinking, if we're going to have Christmas, then we should have a tree. Not this year, J.J. - Why? - Because. Not this year. Can I help you? Yes, um... actually, I would like some scented candles for a gift please. Oh. Our Christmas selection is right there. Behind you, dear. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, these are perfect. What an interesting shop. How long have you been here? Oh... forever and ever. What a lovely antique headboard. It wasn't antique when Herbert and I bought it new. We were married 52 years. Oh, that's beautiful. Your husband...? Passed. Nine years ago. I'm sorry to hear that. You must be lonely all by yourself. Oh, no. Herbert's upstairs. He's upstairs? We lived upstairs all these years. - His spirit is still there. - His spirit? He came back. - Just like dad. - Oh... Stop it. Have you recently lost someone close to you, son? My dad. His spirit's back. Mom won't believe it. Jonathan. Oh, we must believe, or we won't really see what's happening around us. You know, sometimes, when I feel a sudden draft, I'll think, 'There must be a window open'. But it's only Herbert. Cool. Or I'll find a vase of wilted flowers has been replaced with a lovely bunch of daisies. Herbert has passed over. But he still communicates to me. His own way. I want you to have this. Oh, no. No, no, no. I couldn't, thank you. Take it dear. Free of charge. It will help you to understand that we must keep an open mind. "Spirits and Apparitions of Christmas". You see, the dead miss us even more than we miss them, especially at Christmas. Mom, you've got to believe now. - She explained it all to you. - Jonathan, she's sweet. But she's a lonely old lady who misses her husband. But she's not making it up. - Neither am I. - Enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore. Mom doesn't hear anything anyone says anymore. We met a nice old lady at a shop downtown, whose husband's in the same deal as you. - Come on, Dad. - I'm trying. So, what? Her husband's in limbo? Yeah. Mom didn't believe her. Your mom never was open to new ideas. Remember when I wanted to put the game room in the basement? - She shot that down. - Yeah. She wants Christmas, but she doesn't want a tree. I don't know what to do with her. Scores. Like you said, maybe we need to help her be happier. Hmmm... 'Meet your soulmate'. - What do you think? - Well, how does it work? We plug in her name to enter her in the contest. - Okay, and then what? - She gets a bunch of dates. Kind of like winning the lottery. I'm going to put in her name. Okay. - What are her hobbies? - Yeah, right. If she had time for hobbies, you mean. Scuba diving, and horseback riding. She doesn't do either one of those. But it creates a sexy image, Dad. Kind of like a TV commercial. Yeah. Okay. You know what? Put some tennis in there, too. J.J., what are you doing up so late? Uh... just some homework. I thought you'd finished your homework. Oh, this is homework? Bed. Now. Come on. - Love you. - Love you, too. - See you in the morning. - Yeah. Come on, J.J., two out of three. Okay. Oh, honey. Tom. Tom. Tom, answer me. Answer me. Are you here? WKRZ 'Under The Mistletoe' contest. Sign up. You could win $25,000 and hook up with somebody this Christmas holiday that will set you free. Jonathan. Um... Did you hear the piano playing last night? - No. - Are you sure? The last time anybody played was Dad. Did you uh... did you speak with your dad, last night? He was with me when you came into my room. Where was he? He was right next to me. I don't understand. Why is it that you can see him and talk to him and I can't. It's because you're angry with him. How do you know that? He told me. He said he can't take care of his business until you're over your anger. Jonathan... Hey. If I've been upset with you lately, I'm sorry. I've had a lot on my mind. Um... but when things calm down, you and I... - we'll have a long talk. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Come here. Mom... Are we going to lose the house? Who told you that? Dad said you had a mortgage payment and he didn't leave you with a very good hand to play. Listen... Things have not been easy lately, right? But you and I are going to get through it... together, okay? Okay. Have a good day. I'll see you after school. Bye. You still got that look. Yeah. Hopelessness. Confusion. Take your pick. You know, I was thinking, after we talked the other day. Um... If I can grab some private time with Jonathan... - Yeah? - Maybe I can figure out where these conversations with his dad are coming from. Yeah. Well, anything you can suggest, I'm open. Because, ha, right now I am at a complete loss. Okay. Um... Well, there's no hockey practice today. Why don't you... give me an hour after school. Yeah, that's good, that's good. Then you can, uh... pick Jonathan up at the rink. - Yeah, that's fine. - Okay. Thank you... Kevin. - Hey. - Hey. Do you want to lace them up and take a couple shots? I don't have my gear. I bet you we can find something that fits. It's okay. Yeah? Okay. So, how was school today? Okay, I guess. Yeah, I took a look at your grades. - Nice job so far. - Thanks. So this business about your dad coming back, like you said, it hasn't seemed to affect your school work. My dad always tells me I have to pay attention to my school work. He tells you now. - His spirit? - Yeah. You know, most people would say there's no such thing as a spirit. Or ghost. I guess. Now you understand what common sense means, right? My dad says common sense is faith in believing in things, when someone tries to tell you not to. Okay. You got me. Hi, guys. - Sorry I'm late. - No problem. Gave us a chance to actually get to know each other. Oh, good. Uh... Jonathan. Get your backpack. - We've got to go. - Okay. Great kid. Can't say I made much progress. But... there is one thing for certain. He honestly believes his father's spirit is living inside your home. So you don't think he's making it up. Well, I did some research for my degree in psychology and some volunteer work with kids. But I've never heard a kid more logical in his beliefs than Jonathan. Come on, not again. Okay. The trick is where you kick it. Left side, bottom corner. File that for future reference. - Who's this? - He's my counselor. - Hm. - He doesn't understand about ghosts, either. Lot of that going around. - Dad? - Um-hum. After we talked last night. You... didn't go down and play the piano, did you? Okay, I confess. I did. I just... I couldn't resist playing a couple bars of her favourite Christmas song. - You freaked Mom out. - Wait a minute. You're the one who wanted me to communicate with her. Talk with her. Not freak her out. I hope that's schoolwork I can tell your mom you're hard at. Hmmm? Oh, oh. 'Under The Mistletoe' dating search? They emailed back. And they want her as a contestant. Isn't that great? Jonathan, you're going to get me into so much trouble. She'll never go for it. Yes she will. I've got a plan. Susan! - Hi. - Hi. Listen, I had another idea further along the lines of trying to figure out what's going on with Jonathan. Now if I could find a way to spend some time with him in a more relaxed environment. You mean at home? Sure, yeah. If that's not an intrusion. No, no. I think he'd like that. Why don't you come over on a night when you and your wife are free. I'm sorry, I've got to go. But thank you. - I'd like to do that. - Okay. Everything okay with Jonathan? Um-hum. Finished his homework. Tucked away like an angel. Oh, good. Here. - Thank you. - Um-hum. There's that look again. What's bothering you? Diane, you are going to think I've totally lost it. Is this about that book you were reading? Or Jonathan thinking he's communicating with Tom? So, last night, I'm in the living room, and I hear the piano playing, in here. And then I saw it. It was playing by itself. - You mean, nobody? - No one. No one in sight. - Whoa. - Yeah. It was playing Are You Coming Home For Christmas. - Isn't that Tom's... - Yes, that's Tom's favourite Christmas song. And before that the lights were flickering on and off. Are you saying it could have been Tom? I don't know. Isn't that what Jonathan's been...? I don't know. But I don't think it's Jonathan who needs a shrink. I think it's me. Lester loves the Victorian issue. He had me set up an interview for you to plug it. No, no. You got the wrong girl. Oh, come on. You were great on The Morning Show last month. You're a natural. Besides, what Lester wants, Lester gets. ...WKRZ.The Bro signing off. Now over to Carol Stark. I'm Carol Stark and you're listening to the Carol Stark experience. We are here today to change your romantic life. And If you don't have one, well, maybe we can fix that and fatten up your bank account, all at the same time. So get ready to get love smart. Welcome to the show, Susan. I see you're a feature writer for City Week. Yes, and our upcoming issue is one of our best. - Let's get to it, Susan. - Ha. Have a look at me. What do you see? Ummm. You see Cupid and her earthly support system. Do you know what Cupid and her earthly support system is going to do for you today? Creep me out? Help you find the one. Uh, I'm sorry. The one? The one that you've always imagined. The one that you've always wanted. The one who's features only become clear to you in those quiet fantasies that you dare not share with anybody else. You've got to be kidding me, right? You're an attractive professional, Susan. In fact, you're hot. She's really hot, guys. With a very cool job, might I add, as a featured writer - for City Week. - Which is why I'm here. Not to, you know, uh... find the one from my quiet fantasies. We all know that there's exciting new people out there for us to meet. But the trick is, digging them out. And once you do, where's the time, am I right? I think your situation speaks of that. Well, I didn't know that I had a situation. We're all looking for that perfect guy. Or that perfect girl. So I'm here today, Susan, to help you make that - love connection. - Okay. Well, uh... perhaps you could tell us about your boyfriend or husband so I can get a better sense of Cupid's credentials. Well, let's talk about the single scene. A whole new world out there now, Susan. I mean, with your on-line dating, - your chat room... - No. No, I've never done any of that stuff. Well I mean, everybody needs somebody to love. I'm not judging. I just, uh... I just think that meeting somebody is the easy part. I want someone that I can be certain of. So, you're an old-fashioned type gal. Well, What? Are you asking me if I believe in everlasting love? I don't know. I once did. But now, I'm not so sure. I mean, so what do you do? You dream. You hope. Well, I'm not naive. And dreaming... dreaming can be dangerous. And the cost of putting yourself out there is just... it's just too high. So, now, I focus on what's right in front of me. The here and now. Me, too. Because... it hurts too much to fantasize about forever. All right. Let's go to the phones. Belmont, you're up. Hey, Susan. What a sexy voice you have. Just listening to you makes me all like, hot and bothered. So I just have to say this. Will you marry me? Well, there you go, Susan. Your very first marriage proposal. Nice. Excuse me. Hold on. Get right back in there. My life isn't a joke, Diane. Listen. While you were on the air, Lester called. Great. So, I'm fired? Are you kidding? He adored every word he heard. He wants you to do a piece on the 'Under The Mistletoe' dating search through your eyes as a contestant. You've got to be kidding me. The station switchboard lit up like the Vegas strip. The audience went crazy for you. I can't Diane. I can't, I can't do that. Is that really what you want me to tell Lester? No. I want you to tell me whose idea all of this was. Missing a couple players. Might be one who might make a difference. I don't want to play. You hiding from something? I'm not scared. As you get older you're going to realize we're all afraid of something, Jon. At some point you're just going to have to suck it up. Hey. So. We could sure use a right wing. A big divisional game coming up. I'm just waiting for my mom. All right. You feelin' okay? I don't know... My dad says I should play. Yeah, well, your dad sounds like he's um... quite a guy. And here's your mom. Jonathan. Hi, Kevin. So I heard you've had some pretty big ideas lately. - Diane told you? - Yes, Diane told me, but I get the feeling she wasn't the instigator. You know, I was just wrapping practice, if you guys have time to grab a bite. That's really nice of you, but we have to get home. Jonathan and I have... - Can we, Mom. - Please? Mom, can I play a video game? - Yeah, sure. Here. - Hang on. I got it, I got it. - Oh, no, no, that's okay. - Here. Wow. - Bring back the change. - Thanks. That's very generous of you. I apologize if Jonathan's been too forward. No, don't, don't. I've loved spending time with him, getting to understand him better. Jonathan is holding on to his dad. It sounds like he was quite a guy. Oh, yeah, Tom and I were inseparable. I thought we'd be married forever, you know? Only forever didn't happen. I'm the one who's having trouble saying goodbye. Um. Hey. I tried to reach you last night. Jonathan's counselor invited us to get something to eat. The cute guy you backed your car into? - Hey, Diane. - Hey, big guy. I never said that he was cute. Split with me. Jonathan, did you say your counselor was cute? He's a nice guy. I'll get it. - He's nice, he's cute. - He's married. - Happily? - Down girl. All these are from the contest? Every one a prospective suitor. Somebody please save me from this. You're too young to wither away. You have plenty of time for that when you turn 40. All right. "Dear Susie..." Hey, no, no, no. No. No. I can't do this. These guys could all be sumo wrestlers looking for their mothers. Or they could be serial killers looking... Four words, dear. Lester wants you to. "Dear Susan, after listening to you I feel I understand you better than any woman I've ever known. Even better than my sister, Marge." Next. Here. Here's one. "Christmas Greetings..." Well, at least he's got the season right. "I'm a man looking to share my life with someone special. He's not original. But he sounds sincere. "After hearing your hot, sexy voice, I'd like to get you under the..." Jonathan, don't you have homework to do? - No. - Find some. Yeah, buddy. We should sort these into piles. Yeah. Bad. Worse, And Not a Chance in Hell. Oh, come on. Hello. Yeah, this is her. Um... What time? Okay. Yeah. I can... I can do it. They want me back on the radio show. That's great. Okay. So the way that this works is you pick three letters and I pick three letters. Oh, I thought that it was my choice. Honey, when you have your own show, you can make your own rules. We're all looking for somebody who's going to grab us by the heartstrings. No, you need more. You have to have something that's lasting, and real... Well, we know you had a deep love before. Yeah, more meaningful than anything I've ever known. - There was an accident... - No, no. I don't want to revisit that. I just... I just want the truth to be out there. I have an eleven-year-old son who I adore. And anyone who isn't interested in a ready-made family will not pass the entrance exam. We're here with Susan who's on her continuing journey to find a soulmate. Down to six contestants, now. Each has qualified through the letters. So now it's time for Susan to meet her candidates face to face. So, Sterling. Um... how long have you had your dental practice? Twelve years, seven months and counting. I believe in keeping my eye on the ball at all times. - That's good. - You bet. Have you seen any of my TV commercials. You know, I don't think I have. "Stop in to see Sterling, for that sterling smile makeover. Christmas financing available." Wow, that's catchy. Do you know, there are a lot of openings in my field. Openings. Get it? Funny. That's... that's funny. Yeah... Chicken's all right. But... I'm a beef man myself. I like them fired up the way we do back home. Charred on the outside and just blood red on the inside. Well, I'm sure they can make it any way you want, Charlie. Wow, that's some hat you got there. Well, thank you very much. My momma gave me that for my birthday. Oh, well, that's nice. So, you're close with your mom? Ah, shoot, yeah. We go everywhere together. As a matter of fact, she's at the bar right now. Hi, momma. Hey, would you like to go and meet her? Okay, I understand. Maybe later. Um... So, Dwayne. How's the used car business? We move them in, move them out. - That good, huh? - I'm the magic man. In more ways than one. Is she a friend of yours? If I'm lucky. I'm an attractive guy. She's an attractive girl. You're an attractive girl. Do you think I'm hot? I think I'm kind of hot. Hey. I'm gonna kill you, Diane. It's raining losers. And the last one is twenty minutes late. If you found a keeper I'm not sure you'd know - what to do with him. - Oh, yeah. That will be the reality show reject who was playing with his Blackberry while idling the waitress' butt. They don't always come as advertised. - Except maybe this one. - Call me back. Susan. Greg Roberts. May I sit? And after that I pulled my grad stint at Stanford. I went to Berkeley. Oh. Bitter rivals. Oh, I hope we can somehow get past that. Oh, we can certainly try. Okay, so after Stanford... I had offers and, uh... some were good, and some were better. I decided to sign on at Melbourne and Statler and, you know, they tell me I'm on track to make partner and... And you've never been married? A couple of close calls. But... um... So far you've escaped capture. - So far. - Right. What about you? Um. Me? - Well, you know, I was married. - Um-hum. Um... I write features at City Week. - And you have a son. - Oh, yeah, Jonathan. Okay, so you heard me on the radio. Oh, yeah, both times you were on. Oh, god. I got strong armed to be there by a friend. Well, don't apologize for that. I thought you were terrific. Yeah. Sincere. Honest. That's why I wrote my letter. His name's Greg. He's a lawyer. Uh-huh. Is that good or bad? Being a lawyer. A matter of opinion. What a gentleman. I had a very good time tonight. - I did, too. - Good. Dinner tomorrow, then? Um... that would be nice. - Okay. - It was nice to meet you. And you. Um... Give me a call tomorrow? - Tomorrow. - Okay. Give it up. I want every detail. Quiet dinner. Nice conversation. Chemistry? Maybe. Are you going to see him again? I don't know. He wants to. Tomorrow night. Hah. Well, did you enjoy being with him? This is about Tom, isn't it? Haunting you. Playing your favourite Christmas song in the middle of the night. I can't help how messed up my mind is. Why doesn't the piano play when I'm here? Maybe you haven't had enough wine. Oh, I don't know. Maybe I'm not ready for any of this. Uh... Diane. Diane, can you get that? She'll be right down. - Great. - Oh! Hi. Sorry if I'm late. No, you know, a woman is never late if she is worth waiting for. Give me a break. I see you've met Diane. She's... The one who always gets Susan into trouble. Oh, you mean the contest. Well, I think we're both having fun with that, aren't we? Yeah. Well, you two enjoy. We're covered here, right, Jonathan? Oh, honey, come here. Come here, I want you to say hello to Greg. How are you doing there, sport? Mmm... my name is not sport. Okay. Jonathan. This doesn't mean we're not going to be friends, does it? Honey, Greg just asked you a question. I have homework. It was really nice to meet you. - And you. - Have fun. - Shall we? - Okay. Do you believe in love at first sight? Ha..um... I believe that love can be blind. Hm... I was talking about us. Well, Greg, I hardly know you. Yes, well... We can fix that. - Susan. - Kevin, hi. Um... I'm running late and I'm afraid I need a favour. - Sure. If I can. - Well, I hate to even ask. But um... you were going to come by on Saturday and see Jonathan? Is there any way you could come by tonight, instead? Tonight? I'm in a bind. I have an engagement - I have to get to. - A date? Yeah, a date. Uh... no, I don't see a problem with tonight. Really? Okay, great. Seven o'clock? - It's a done deal. - I owe you one, Kevin. Thank you. You look beautiful tonight. Those words will make any woman blush. So, how's Jonathan? I don't think we got off to a very good start. Well, don't take it personally. He, uh... he misses his father, you know? Yeah. He's working through some things. And you? I'm learning that just because you get through one day, doesn't mean that you'll get through the next. But you're working on it. I'm trying. Do you ever talk to your dad out here? When he feels like it. But he talks to you mostly in your room, you said? He comes to school, sometimes. What... When I was there? Nobody, but me, saw him. Right. And the reason for that would be? You gotta believe in him in order to see him. Oh. Now I understand this rink has a history. My granddad played hockey when it first opened. My dad taught me to skate here. And he taught you pretty good. You know, from what I hear. I guess. You know what my wife used to say? She would say, "Follow your heart. And don't look back. You do that and sometimes life surprises you." Well, here we are. Thank you for a fun night. Thank you. This is getting way too serious. Uh-huh. Maybe we need to go to Plan B. Yeah, yeah. I didn't know we had a Plan B. Psst, Kevin. Sorry. I guess I dozed off. Apparently in the midst of some, uh... engrossing Christmas reading? Yes. Spirits and Apparitions of Christmas. Any tips? So do we call a medium, ghostbusters? It says that the unseen world is part of Christmas. Beginning with Santa and all the way into Charles Dickens. Ah. I guess I must have missed that chapter. You didn't see anything while you were here? No. No. No apparitions. But I think we're actually making some progress. Oh. That's really good. That's good. Yeah. The hockey rink seems special to him. Yeah, I mean that's where, you know, he grew up, playing hockey with his dad. And when his dad died he couldn't bring himself to pick up a hockey stick. - I've got to get this. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - That's okay. I'll... uh... I'll let myself out. Listen, Kevin, I really appreciate your helping me out. Let's get together sometime this week when your wife is free? - Dinner? - Yeah. - Take your call. - Okay. Thank you. For everything. You couldn't wait 'til work? Ah... No way. It was nice. It was nice. What's next, Dad? Check your notes. You had some good thoughts in there. Right. Follow your heart. Never look back. That's good. Oh, hey, also... um... Try working in 'Life happens while you're waiting for true love.' That's kind of corny, though, isn't it? Women, they love corny. Put that in there. Okay. Okay, now I'll send the email. Remember how to set up an account so she doesn't know where it came from? Yeah. Okay. 'Morning, honey. You have your homework ready? It's almost time to go. You going to get your books? There's a letter on the fridge. That letter? It was in the stack of piles you and Diane picked out. Umm. I don't remember this one. It must have fallen on the floor. Um... the deadline for the letters is already over. It's not over until it's all over. You really need to read the letter. Okay. "Dear Susan, I want you to know that I have never wrote... a letter like this before. What I found is that sometimes life happens while you're waiting for true love. But sometimes life surprises you. The truest love can be found when you least suspect it. I think passion is important in a relationship, but it's not enough. You have to find someone to share your dreams with. You can't go wrong if you follow your heart and never look back. If you'd like to meet I will be at McBurney's coffee shop Friday at 4 p.m. Unsigned, until we meet." Hey, Jackie. Looks like the sales rep is a no show. Okay. Mom, this was important. You said you read it. Well, I did read it. Why are you so upset, huh? You didn't go to McBurney's today? Now, Jonathan, I was really busy at work. I had to come home. I had to make dinner. The guy who wrote this could be the one for you. Honey, it wasn't even signed. Was too, just not with his real name. Okay, Jonathan, what do you... OW! Damn. Hand me that towel. Okay, I am really stressed out right now. I'm spread very thin. It's because you're spending too much time with Greg. That's not fair. Okay, you were the one who wanted me to do this radio show in the first place. Now I've met someone. Jonathan! Okay, I want you dressed and ready for dinner in ten minutes. Shoot... Shoot... Greg's not right for her. You got to do something, Dad. Maybe some ghost stuff. Convince her you're here and it will change her mind. What do you mean? Like cheap tricks? Like in the movies. Jonathan. Dinner. Okay, come on. Come on, son. Go on. Just make the best of it. Okay. But you've got to do something serious, before it's too late. Okay. So... Jonathan... Do you like football? I like hockey. Oh. Right. Play for your school team? I used to. Oh, Jonathan's being modest. I love watching him play. So, why'd you quit? I don't want to talk about it. Why not? Because I don't. You mean with me? You don't want to talk about it with me. Okay. I don't want to talk about it with you. Jonathan, Greg is trying to be nice to you, honey. I don't need him to be nice to me. Well, then, maybe you better apologize for your bad manners and go to your room. He's just having a tough time. Me, too. Um... pepper? My god, you're beautiful. How am I going to get you to understand, and to let go. How am I going to let go. - Hi, Greg. - Hey, Susan. Look, I'm sorry to call so late. - No, that's okay. - I really just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed tonight. And well, you know, the clock's ticking towards the end of the contest and... Yeah, it's on Christmas Eve, isn't it? Yeah... and really one more night before you make your decision. Look, Susan, I'd really like to spend that night with you. And this time I want to make the arrangements, okay? Come here. Someday, when I get a job, I'm going to buy mom that necklace for Christmas. You know, I'd float you a loan, but I'm afraid I'm not in that tax bracket. Ha. That's okay. I want to do it myself. I'm going to start with a paper route and then save my money. You know Jonathan, I think this is where I take my leave. I want you to come in for a minute. No, I think your mom's busy. It's my house too. Come on. Kevin. Hey, Jonathan. Greg, Greg Roberts. This is Kevin Harrison. Kevin is Jonathan's school counselor. - Hey. Nice to meet you. - Hi. Um... thank you for taking Jonathan. No problem. Uh... can Kevin stay awhile? We have stuff to talk about. Yeah, sure. Your wife couldn't make the shopping trip? Mom. Kevin's wife, she... She passed away... almost two years ago. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It was awhile ago. I saw that photo in your office and I... Kind of hard to forget. Yeah, I guess that's part of life, Kevin. Jonathan, I, uh... I'd better get going. Um... Merry Christmas, everybody. Merry Christmas. Kevin! My mom wants to see you. She's sorry she didn't know about your wife. Oh, no. You tell her it's no big deal. I... I probably wasn't clear when we talked. It's not something I'm terribly comfortable talking about. So... You talked about her with me. Yeah, well, we talked about a lot of stuff, didn't we? Kevin... I was wondering... whether the team's ready for the game against Hamilton? Well, Hamilton's got home ice advantage. The guys are going to give it their best shot. - I'll see you at school. - Yeah. Now, you tell me what you think of this? Oh... Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. Jonathan. Jonathan, come here. Look what Greg got me. Hey. Hold on. I've got something for you too, sport. Ah, ha. My name's not sport. Jonathan, Greg just got you a Christmas gift. You have to say 'thank you' and be gracious. Here you go. Jonathan. Jonathan! Jonathan. Jonathan! Jonathan! Relax. He's just pouting somewhere. He wants attention. Jonathan! He'll be back. Jonathan. JON. Jonathan. "Have you recently lost someone close to you, son?" "My dad. His spirit's back. Mom won't believe it." - "Jonathan." - "Oh, we must believe or we won't really see what's happening around us." Hi, is he okay? Thanks for calling, Kevin, I was worried sick. Careful, it's... uh... Um...! Hot. Yeah. Hot. Chocolate. He's an easy kid to get attached to. Yeah! Don't I know it. I don't think you know how concerned he is. Even when things are going better for me I just feel so... Lost. As a parent, yeah. Well, he's... he's young. There's lots of time. I don't even know what he wants for Christmas. At one point I did. He wants you to be happy. Do you have kids, Kevin? No. No. We, uh... We didn't get to that. - How did she, uh... - Heart disease. She was 28. Ohhh... I mean, we never thought somebody that young would... I should... I should get Jonathan home. Yeah. He's going to need a good night's sleep. He's got a big day tomorrow. Yeah, Christmas Eve. That, and the annual game. But I thought... Jonathan told me he wants to give it a shot. He hasn't played hockey since his dad died. Oh, wait, wait, he doesn't even have new skates. - How can he...? - Once he's on the ice he's going to be fine. Oh, you! - I'm sorry. - I should... I should go. No, don't be sorry. Don't be sorry. It was my fault. No, it was nobody's fault. Mom? Kevin is really the one you want. The letter I asked you to read. It was Kevin who was waiting for you at McBurney's. The letter was written by Kevin? Yeah. Well, no. Well, which one is it J.J., yes or no? I used some of Kevin's words. Stuff I'd heard him say. But I know it's what he thinks is true like about following your heart and... and about you. So, so you wrote the letter. With Dad's help. Is your father here? Right now? He's right over there. If you don't believe in him, if you're still angry with him then you're never going to see him. Was this whole thing your dad's idea? It was mine. But... Dad thought it was cool. Your dad thought it was cool to embarrass me? No, Mom, that's not what we were trying to do. - Greg isn't... - I don't want to hear about Greg! Sorry. Okay, listen. We'll finish this in the morning. - No. - You gotta go to bed. I love you. Goodnight. Easy bud. She's exhausted. She's so messed up. Greg's trying to buy her with gifts and I... Shhhh. If I was you, little man, I'd stay out of the line of fire until the time's right. Okay? She just has to be ready to hear the truth. "The spirit is locked into a special person, place or thing that was special to him or her before they passed on. They have to resolve this connection before they can be free." Tom. If you can hear me, can you let me know? Somehow send me some kind of a sign. I'm here, Sue. I'm right here. Tom. I wish I could just come over there and give you the biggest hug. This spirit thing, it's kind of tricky. - Jonathan was right. - Yeah. How can I have known? Well, you always were a tough nut to crack. I was the sentimental one. I still get teared up when I think about the Red Sox winning the series. Or whenever I think about our favourite Christmas song. You have always been in my heart. It's just that you left such a big hole in our lives, I... You think that I wanted to leave? There's a lot of things about this whole thing that I don't understand, except that everything happens for a reason. There is no good reason for you to have left us. - I can't accept that. - Okay, look. Look. My time here is just about up. - No. - I have to get going soon. No. No, you can't. Jonathan needs you. I need you. That's not what you need. You see... I've been trying to figure this thing out. About why it is that I'm still here. At first I was thinking it was for Jonathan and to help you. And I was hurt because I couldn't reach you and you didn't believe in me. But now I know that I'm here because I needed you. I was holding on. I couldn't let go. But I'm going to do that now. No. No. Honey, I need you to let go of my death. Remember my life. You've got tomorrow to look forward to. For you and for Jonathan. And... so many more tomorrows after that. I love you so much, Tom. I will love you forever, sweetheart. Do you believe in happy endings? I did. Once. Okay. Try to remember. Sometimes who you need the most is right in front of you without you even seeing it. Tom. Tom. Tom. Loving you is the easiest thing I've ever done in my life. I'll be on your shoulder forever, sweetheart. Goodbye. Okay, well we're on in ten minutes. Nervous? A little. Well, we've already done the heavy lifting. All you have to do is open the envelope. Um... Can I use the restroom before I go on the air? - Hurry. - I'll come with you. Great. Jonathan, stay here? - Yup. - Okay. What...? Are you crazy coming here? I'm about to go on. I just wanted to remind you of our little agreement, that's all. Look I was going to call you last night. I don't think I can make this work. This will work, Carol, okay? You'll make it work. Do you realize that I can lose my job over this, Greg? Your job? Let me just remind you of your two DUls, and, oh, there was that little jam with the IRS. And I fixed it all with a little whisper to your management. So, I think it's payback time. You are such a jerk. Do you think it's my problem that you can't pay your loan shark? Here's how it's going to be. Susan Chandler is your Mistletoe girl. And I need to be the number one bachelor. And I need to take that to the bank. Quite literally. Excuse me. Hello. Oh, hi. I realize... I realize, well, as a matter of fact, I'm just dealing with my cash flow problem as we speak. No, no, no. No, no, I promised you that I would make good. I don't think that you need to threaten... Twenty-four hours. Okay. No, no, you have my word. Two spirits are going to get together and possibly win $25,000 apiece. That's what's happening at WKRZ. Mom! I really need to talk to you. No, no. Can it wait? I'm going on right now. - We're going On Air. - You can sit in the lobby. Mom, I... So, Susan, the big moment is here. We're about to reveal your pick for bachelor number one in our date search. You and your partner will be sharing fabulous prizes, including enough cash flow to make your Christmas very merry and oh, so bright. Here it goes, Susan. And the winner of our contest is... Susan? Someone very close to me once told me that sometimes what you need is right in front of you. And someone else taught me that you always have to follow your heart. My past will always be part of my future. And that future includes one man. And that man is... Kevin Harrison. Whahoo! Come on, coach. We've got a game to play. What are you all standing there for? LET'S GO!!! Come on, hurry! Hurry, go, go, go! Oh, hey. You've got two minutes. Get your gear on. - Hi. - Hi. I... uh... I heard the show. I had you right in front of me, all this time. And I had no idea what to do. Come on, coach! - You should go. - I have to go. - I'll see you - Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. - Jonathan, come on! - Yeah, mom. Now, we get to see what you're made of. Put your hands in here, right now. On three, Team. One, two, three, - TEAM! - GO GET 'EM! Hey. You ready, John? Okay. Hey, good to have you back. Here, Mikey! Go, Mikey, go! Nice, J.J. - Okay, time! - Time out! Time out! Come in here! Come in here! Your guys' game's in line. Here's the play. Okay, Mikey. It's all on you. You win the draw, okay? Get it back to Zack. Push it over to Bobby. And then back up, Mikey, and go over and swap spots with Jonathan. Jonathan, move into the zone. Mikey, they're going to be watching for you. This is important. You're going to draw it past Jonathan. Jonathan in front, that spin I saw you do... back in the net. - Okay? You got that? - Yeah. Okay. On three, Team. - One, two, three! - TEAM! Jon. You got it? - I'll put it in the net. - All right, bud. Come on, Jonathan! Stick to me like glue. Dad! You weren't going to invite me to the party, Jon? Dad. You can't help me. No cheap tricks. That's not the way I taught you. You're going to win it on your own, right, bud? Do it for your school, for your mom, and for me. Stay close. Wait for the goalie to commit. NOW! YES! ALL RIGHT! Get out there, guys. Whahoo! We did it! Good job. I'm so proud of you! Way to shoot, son! Way to score! Excuse me. Excuse me. That was... Ha, ha. What have you done? Wow! New skates! You, uh... you know how to use those, right? Yeah. - This one's from me. - Thanks. Okay, son, I'll give you a hand. - Thank you. - Aargh. This is the last year where I'm picking you up. You're doing it yourself next year. Mmmm, look at that. It's beautiful. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ + |T|h|e| |D|e|a|f| |B|o|y|s| |F|o|r| |B|o|y|s| |G|r|o|u|p| + +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ E N J O Y this SRT SUBTITLE R e l e a s e
