When I grew up in Red Hook, it was a third world country. Made the Lower East Side look like paradise. Gritty, desperate Red Hook. You had to stand up for your friends, your family, yourself. "Man up", my dad used to say. He raised me to be a man, dad did. He wanted a son. He taught me judo. Muay thai, karate, fencing, and gun control. Always carry a gun. Always take control. He was a cop. So am I. Charlie, you made it. - No shit? - Yeah it came through. Fuck! Yeah! So I'm a detective. Detective Charlie Black. Woah, woah, woah. Intern, Charlie. You still gotta pass muster. Oh, I'll pass. Flying colors. Your father woulda been proud you know. Woulda? He is. Hey dad. Take a moment to check your seat back pocket for any personal items. Like tablets and cell phones. - Hi! - Hi. It was so amazing! Okay... The muons and then the collisions. And sometimes I didn't sleep for days. It was one quantum equation for three straight weeks. Did you hear we had an antimatter breakthrough? Yeah, I read about it. And the hotel! I mean Switzerland is adorable. And it's so clean. And the people there are so, so nice! And then Geneva is just dripping with money it's so sophisticated. I mean watches? Oh yeah! So it was good? 17,000 scientists came together to make this happen from all over the world, and I was one of them. How about some Saki? Sure. So what have you been doing? How have you been? Alright. Sketching, working. How have you been? Alright. You must've had some fun. It's really not that fun without you here. What can I do for you sir? - Have a seat, Mackly. - Sure. So, heard you stopped a robbery over on Baker Street this morning. Yes sir. - Nice work. - Thanks, Captain. Just doing my job. - What? - This job that you're doing. Y'know you're a smart guy right? I think so. Do you like math? Yeah sure. Good, great. Cause I got a math problem for you. See, shopkeep's got 800 bucks right? Guy comes in, robs him. Cop shows up, hero of the day, gets him his money back. Now later that night, shopkeep checks to see how much he's got left. And there's only 650. So we come to the problem, what happened to the 150 he's missing? I have no idea sir. Maybe he took some for himself? The guy works his ass off every single day, that's not a bad thing right? What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Well, see, I know you're the goose. And I think the goose is a selfish prick who thought it was okay to steal from the rest of the pond just because he had to get his beak a little dirty. I don't know where you're going with this. Your goose isn't cooked just yet. And you know why? Cause you're gonna go down to the shop. And you're gonna open your wallet. - And with a big fucking smile on your face... - I can't do that... You'll give him every dollar you've got, I don't give a shit how much you've got. Now get out. Eric. Meet Detective Intern Charlie Black. Charlie has just been selected for our. Minority Detective Fast Track Intern Program. She's spanking brand new. And I mean that with all due respect. You're her assigned mentor. So please, clean up your act. She's one of us. Charlie, Captain Walker. Well, prettiest fast track I've ever seen. Damn it Eric! That's okay chief, I get it. Eric doesn't get out much. If Charlie writes you up, you're gonna have a big pain in your ass. So please toe the fucking line. Ah, sorry Charlie. Eric and I are cool, don't worry. So, ready to get to work? It's what I'm here for. - What's wrong? - Nothing. You seem quiet. I'm fine. You miss Switzerland? The tunnel, seventeen miles of super-conducting magnets, underground. And everyone on my team, I mean there was Rolph, Deutch, we called him Deutch because he was German. I mean just, the smartest people in the world. So, so brilliant. Sounds exciting. It was. Yeah. I am so proud of you, Charlie. Thank you Aunt Dida, I'm so excited! You will find the one, Charlie. What "one" Aunt Dida? He's bad, Charlie. You must not stop until you destroy his soul. I cannot see, I can't say but, your Grandmother know. Flutter Dove knew all. But you will know too. But I have to run. My rabbit is cooking up. Of course! Goodbye Aunt Dida. Find him, Little Warrior. Hey there, fast track. Oh! I'm sorry Captain! I'm not used to people grabbing me like that unless I want them to. Overreaction maybe? Street instincts. I didn't pull the trigger so... Right... no harm no foul. You do that again I'll break your arm. I wouldn't bet on it. So, you all settled in? Anything I can get you? Water? Coffee? Bullets? Yeah, I've been reading through the files, and I was wondering if I could have access to transcripts 321 through 415. That's a lot of reading. Is there something you're looking for? You just started. - Questions. - Questions? Yeah, dad always said you have to know the questions before you can find the answers. Chief Blackhorse. Of course, I can get them to you. Today. Is there a rush? I've got a lot of free time on my hands. I had an idea for a cartoon. - It's a great statement. - Yeah, what? Jesus, Muhammad, and Clarence Darrow walk into a bar, and they go up to the bartender... - I cannot draw Muhammad. - Why not? Are you that out of touch? I could be killed. But you're censoring yourself. It's not censorship, I choose not to draw Muhammad. You're avoiding the truth. What's the point of freedom if you can't use it? Look Cece, I get it. Truth is your passion... Truth is my God, Paul! My God! How about a drink tonight? - Me? - Yeah, you. I'm not mixing business with pleasure. So you'd take it as a pleasure then? Look, I'm just asking you like you were a guy. Guys get drinks together, right? Of course... you're obviously not a guy. Oh, what tipped you off? My breasts? Have you heard that "not if you were the last guy on Earth" expression? No. Google it. I don't want you seeing that loser Patrick again! And if you sneak out of this house again you are grounded! Wait until your father gets home! Mom, I'm old enough to make my own decisions! You can't tell me who I can see and not see! We'll see about that! You go up to your room young lady and I don't want to hear a peep out of you! - Fine! - Fine! Found any questons in the files yet? - Nothing. - Ah, I'm sorry. They're there though, they have to be. You know, you really gotta feel for those hookers out there. Yeah, they deserve more money. What do you mean? Women are so underpaid, no matter what they do. Barry Bonds got 100 million dollars for hitting a baseball. And the best blowjob in the world gets, what, a few hundred bucks? Maybe? I'm sorry, I'm not getting the strange comparison here. If you had to give up one for the rest of your life; Would you give up baseball or sex? Baseball. What would you rather do, watch Bonds hit a home run or get the best blowjob in the world? Uh, I, I don't know, the blowjob? So why does Bonds get all the money, but the women get arrested? Why are we here when we could be out looking for real criminals? The kind that rob and rape and kill? They're everywhere and we're here. You know, I don't know, Charlie. I just do what I'm told. Yeah let's save the world! Bust some hookers. Hey officers! Business, uh, slow today? Well I guess it just picked up now, didn't it? Why don't you go find some real criminals? - What are you sketching? - Just a drawing. "Why me?" I don't get it. - It's a joke. - What joke? Look everyone says "why me" but everyone dies, so then how can you say "why me"? I know but why is that funny? I don't know, it just is. It's ironic. Black humor. Just funny. I guess... Well, you don't have to find it funny, because my publisher does. Well I don't find it funny. A strange kind of thing happened today. What? A woman was yelling in a restaurant... Sounds normal. I mean I looked around, and nobody else was paying attention to her... So you imagined it. I guess... - Look you've been working really hard... - No, that isn't it. It was real. I didn't imagine it, it was there. Only I saw her yelling. But there were still restaurant sounds? I think... I think it was a vision... Or something. It was there. Like the past, or the future... Or something. I could feel it. Or you were hallucinating. Damn it, Paul! I wasn't imagining it! - What are you doing? - What? Who was that? Who? - Another vision? - You were making love, it was real. - Wait what? - She was pretty. - It was a dream. - It wasn't a fucking dream, okay? Okay. What did she look like? Pretty... dark skin... Nevermind... So, you see people with paper bags wandering in, you know they're not brown-bagging lunch. I get it. But we can't raid it? No, by the time we get in they flush it. Plus all we're gonna pull out is pond scum. We need to reach upper levels of management here. - Chop off the head. - Bingo. Pass go. Collect 200 dollars. - You know, you're not so bad. - I'm not? For a self-centered, oafy, kind of insensitive prick you're not all bad. Jeez, what a compliment. You thought that was a compliment? What are you, a salivating horn dog? What? Is that bad? So, I told you how fun stakeouts are, haven't I? Like watching mold grow. Can't think of anyone I'd rather do that with. - So this blowjob... - Oh... - I've been thinking about it. - I bet you have. I just, I gotta know. Is it you? Am I the best in the world? I don't know, I think blowjobs are in the eye of the beholder. - Ew, that is not what I meant! - Stop, you're turning me on. What I meant was, you'd have to try the Olympic hopefuls. Compare mine to theirs and see what you thought. I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight. Sorry. 500 a day? Your ad said affordable prices. Okay, well is there any way you could follow him for only two days? Uh, right. Right. Um... Well could you, could you recommend a cheaper private detective? Cheaper? Okay, I'll... Alright, thank you. Bye. Well, guess you didn't need my help. I had another vision. Again? This was a murder. He was... Well-dressed, she had blonde hair, a red dress, red lips. Very pretty. He strangled her! Were there other people there? Everyone acted normal! I was the only one who noticed! I realize you think this is real. It is real! What if it's actors rehearsing for some kind of role? No, no, no! I know when someone is afraid. Really struggling! This wasn't acting! She died! So it could've been some kind of dream or something! This was a murder! A real murder! Sketch her! I'm gonna describe her to you. I wanna thank you for backing me up with the force investigation. I told them the truth as I saw it. Well, you really didn't see what happened. I heard the shots. They shot first. End of story. That's true. Are you kidding? This is huge! I had to come! Listen, Cece, Your visions are coinciding with sunspot and solar flare activity I've correlated them. They're occuring within just a few minutes of each other. And it's very consistent. That's just a coincidence. Solar flare radiation doesn't affect dark matter. We think it doesn't. But the coronal mass ejection of a magnetic force field could possibly alter a time field. It's theoretically possible. We've been seeing some very weird little anomolies in the beryllium isotope test. Beryllium 10, a particle is there, And then it's not there, and then it's there again. And the Japanese team is seeing the same thing, I can show you the screenshots. We're talking nanoseconds here but that's enough to make you stop and think. I mean we haven't experimented with brainwaves or a space continuum, yet. But coincidence is out of the question. Possibly. Then, it isn't reality? I mean, at least our reality? If my hunch is correct; not reality in this universe, but an alternate universe would explain it, right? A momentary overlap. But the vision is real? A vision from an alternate universe would still be real, yeah. So in this world this man is innocent? - Well, yes. - But that's so strange. But the science is brand new, it's all theory. I mean it's quite possible you're seeing him doing something in this universe. - So he could be guilty? - Yep. - Huh. Cece Blair... Okay Miss Blair, I'm Captain Walker. What is this about? I think I know who murdered a missing girl who disappeared probably months or years ago. What girl? I don't know her name, but she was strangled. She's missing, and how do you know she was strangled? I saw the murder last week. You saw the murder last week, and you've waited until just now to report it? Well I didn't see it when it happened, I just saw it last week. In a restaurant. With him and her. I mean he didn't do it then in the restaurant, he probably strangled her months ago, or maybe longer. And it wasn't really her of course. But it was him. It was a vision. A vision? A real vision, I really saw it. I mean I know it could be an alternate universe vision and that it didn't really happen. But it did really happen in that universe. I mean it could simply be a tear in the fabric of the space-time continuum. But it's possible that I really did see the past, and that he really did do it, or is going to do it. And I think you should look into it. You should look into his background, you should run a background check. Or a profile on him. I have a sketch of her. Do you watch a lot of detective shows Miss Blair? You should get a warrant on his cell phone records or put out an APB or... Can you describe what he looks like? I know where he works. Look, it's a vision, not a murder. And we can't act on that. We can't go harassing people because you had a dream. This man can't be approached, we don't have a weapon, we don't have a body, we don't have a murder. We don't know if any of this is even real. End of story. But you can look into it. I can't open a case on a dream. You need substantial evidence. And a dream is not evidence. A vision. I'm sorry Miss Blair, but that's how these things work. Now if you'll excuse me. Captain, can I get you a coffee? Why so nice? I need a real life case, this vision killing sounds fascinating. We can't waste our time with whacky, dippy, drugged-up visions. - There's something to this, I can feel it. - No. Just two weeks. One week. No more. Hey Captain, how's it going? 1am? Yeah I know, it's past my bedtime. So, I was thinking you might wanna come over for your cup of coffee. Thought so. There's lots of dangerous people around the neighborhood, so make sure to bring protection. What is all this? I get it. I really get it. - What? - It's so clear! I have a vagina! We all do! All of us! We all have vaginas! What? We control male pleasure, so men control us. They beat us, and they rape us, and then they arrest us for selling them pleasure. And then they make us wear, I mean pasties, and fig leaves, and... and veils! And then they hunt us down, and they mutilate us. And the minute we fight back, it's our fault. I mean their laws control our bodies, and our vaginas control the future of the species. I mean of the world! And that... that is why... Serial killers kill us... and cops don't look for us! Vaginas! So you see, I have to do it! - Do what? - Find him. Kill him. You? You are obsessed! Or confused! This has gone on too long, you're too emotional about this! I'm emotional? Look, I let you go to Switzerland, but you... Oh! You let me go to Switzerland? But this has gone on long enough. You have to stop! I don't have to stop. You have to leave. You can't really mean that. I mean... It's just, Switzerland, the visions... we can work this out. It's over! You have to move out! I'm sorry, but I have work to do! I have important work to do. You can't really mean this. Look, I'll grab my things and I'll give you a call in a week. I'm sure you'll feel differently then. Yeah, right. I have so much to do... - What's going on? - Shhhhh! Just... come, quick! Look. There's 40,000 unidentified human remains in the US. 40,000 people. No one knows who they are. That's crazy. But... what about their DNA? No money, no time. And the few who are DNA'd? Most agencies; ours included by the way, doesn't have the time to download them and research them. With all the missing persons and unidentified human remains. My calculations show there could be up to fifty active serial killers. Like, right now. And, I know where one is. Look at this. Strange right? Too many to be a coincidence. So, Red Hook then? Has to be. Okay. The chief ain't gonna buy any of this. We have real cases to solve, Charlie. We don't have a body... there's just no way he's gonna authorize an investigation. I'll do it. Hey there, handsome. Hi, how are you? Hey there, handsome. Hi. How are you? They make good drinks here? I like sake. Unfiltered. Straight. You? Do I look good? Do I look fucking good? Do I look like I have a vagina? Do you wanna pick me up? Do you want me hard? You wanna tie me up? You wanna strangle me? You wanna kill me? You like killing women, do you Jorden? Do you? Do you? Do you? - Chief! - We don't have the resources, Charlie! How did you kn... Okay look, I just need me and the Captain, that's it. We solve real crimes. You solve real crimes. This is a real crime. Here. Solve real crimes, not dreams. And from this day forward, don't go above your supervisor's head. Or you're not just reassigned, Detective Intern, you're fired. Hi. Hello. May I have a seat? By all means. Please, sit. Would you like a drink? Love one. What are you having? Amaretto sour. It's a pleasure of mine. I'll have the same. You've been stalking me. Guilty. Why is a handsome guy like yourself here all alone? I like to come here for the solitude. After a long, busy day at the firm. I need this to get away from... problems. Groove to the tunes. Sounds interesting. What do you do? - Amaretto Sour please. - With pleasure. I'm a stockbroker. And today we had this new company that just went public. I told one of my clients, they needed to get them in within seconds. Said, I'll put you in at 12, get them out by 27. He would be looking at serious money, in just one hour. I feel like I'm losing you. No, no, I love this story. It sounds exciting. So, what do you do? I was studying dark matter, which is The Collider Project! Wow, that's amazing. So, you're like a scientist. Well, a theoretical physicist. That's, that sounds exciting. Oh, really? Yeah, I mean you're discovering the beginning of time, the universe, life. Well I mean, not all alone, but... So, do you like to make the big trades? Yeah, the bigger the better. I say go for it. It's hard to believe that someone like you isn't already dating someone, or married. I haven't had much luck in the love department. Really? What went wrong? Things just don't seem to work out. But you haven't given up? No. Well, I think that you should keep trying. No risk, no reward, you know... Well, I was thinking the same thing. I think that if you keep trying really hard. Things will work out for you. Go for it. Any luck with that vision killing yet? Nothing yet really. But I will, why? - I've got a hunch. - What is it? Well it's just a hunch. I'm going to check something out in Red Hook. - Why won't you tell me? - I'll let you know. - Tell me! Look, let me see if I'm on the right track first, it might not be safe. Safe? What the fuck? Fuck you! Charlie! Come on! You could be seeing something real, but there are some serious problems. What problems? 600,000 people disappear in the US every year. On any given day there could be up to 100,000 people missing. What? Within a year most are found, but those that aren't we just don't have the resources to look for them. They're just 2,000 needles in our haystack. But our priorities are crimes we know about. So no one looks for them? After a few weeks, rarely. Especially if they have vaginas. Well, dead women don't have equal rights either. I wanna help. What is this, Detective? Just a couple missing person questions. They disappeared in your neighborhood, I was wondering if you saw anything. No, not that I can think of. - Can I come in? - Of course, of course. A young Bosnian immigrant woman disappeared recently. Okay. Brown hair, dark eyes. About five feet six. A dancer. Sound familiar? No, not really. Seen anything suspicious in your neighborhood? Nope. Not that I can think of. Oh, is this your family? Yes. Why? Just curious. Are you suspecting me? Of course not. You know detectives, we get suspicious of everyone. I don't know anything, detective. Of course not. Just canvassing the neighborhood. It was a pleasure meeting you. Here's my card. If you see anything, please call me. Sure, I will. There's not much surface activity up there. Yeah right? And you're absolutely sure no new visions? Not a one. Cece look, I shared our data with the Japanese team. And when they saw the correlations of your visions and the solar flare activity they got very excited. We're pretty much convinced that you're getting glimpses of an alternate universe. Crazy right? I mean please don't tell anyone about this, obviously we're not ready to publish. But, as far as your young man is concerned, I'm positive he's done nothing wrong. In this universe. I mean I guess. I tested him and he didn't do anything. You... - You met? - Yes. Well that was maybe dangerous. On the other hand I sincerely believe you have nothing to worry about. I mean I guess that's good news. So I don't have to kill him? Yeah. - You seem to mean that. - I do. Okay... okay. Excuse me. Do you have any books with hybrid animals? Oh yes, just on that table over there. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hello. I'm Captain Walker. - You must be AJ? - Yes, nice to meet you. So on the phone, you told me that some stange man came in here asking questions recently? Yes, we get a lot of strange requests, obviously. You might say morbid. This one was different? He was admiring some preserved body parts. And then he asked about the formula, so that he could preserve a doll. A doll? But dolls don't need to be preserved, now do they? That's what I thought. Seemed very strange. But not in a good way. I asked what kind of doll and he just smiled. Can you describe him at all? Anything you noticed about him? He was African American, well-built, just under six feet tall maybe. Well dressed, clean. Oh and he mentioned something on his cell phone. What was that? Something about a package, and 18. - Okay. - Yes, 18. Anything else? Uh, no. That was it. He left. It was a couple of months ago. I see. Thanks, look, here's my card. If you remember anything else, if he comes in again, call me. I'd really appreciate it. Of course, Captain. I most certainly will. Thanks AJ. This is a surprise. Thank you so much for coming. Well, we wanted to hear more about your visions, Miss Blair. - You were in New York weren't you? - Yes. Not in Switzerland? Did you have any visions in Switzerland while working on the collider? No I didn't. Were you taking any drugs or medications when you had these hallucinations? Visions. No I don't use drugs. Tell us about the man in the dream. Was he Middle Eastern looking? Did you notice any tattoos? Any religious jewlery? A beard? Sandals? Anything like that? - A hood? - No. Have you been approached by anybody about your work in the collider? Has anybody asked about results? Pictures? Anything? This isn't about the murder? Are you the FBI? Our jurisdiction is a little more broad than that. Well who are you? Do you have a warrant? We don't need a warrant, we can investigate any national security threat at any time. National security threat? Relax, Cece. We're just trying to get to the truth. Okay, the truth is; I am inviting you out. Please leave. Here's my card. If you see anything suspicious in one of your... visions, please call us. Please leave now. So, I researched that Bosnian immigrant woman that disappeared in Red Hook recently. She had a normal job, but also possibly a high-end sex worker on the side. Her parents were killed by Serbs, she's still supporting her brother and sister in Bosnia. Anyway, it couldn't have been Jorden. He was away the whole week that she disappeared, on business in Chicago. There's camera footage and everything, it couldn't be him. Really? He's innocent? I mean that's what Bradley told me but... So, like, are your visions something else then? An alternate universe. I mean that's what Bradley thinks. My brainwaves are being disturbed by solar flares. I mean as sure as a theorist can be, that is. Well, it's not Jorden. So he's safe. That's a relief. What's wrong, baby? Uh... It's just a bad dream, nothing. I guess I wasn't there to protect you. Tell me about it. Do you love me? Of course. Charlie. What is it? - Walker's missing. - Missing? He hasn't reported in. He isn't in his apartment. His cell phone is dead. That's all we have. I put the everyone on the case. Don't worry, we'll find him. - How long has he been missing? - 48 hours. Any leads? Nothing. - Hello? - Hello, Cece? Guess what's coming up? - Jorden? - Our six month anniversary! I have a surprise for you. This sounds mysterious. I rented a little studio in Red Hook. Come to 260 Convent Street. Look for Loft 18. I'll have clothes for you to wear. Jorden? Come on Cece, play along. Call me Jayden. Okay, "Jayden". No one will know but us. So let's have fun. Don't tell Jorden our little secret, okay? Alright, okay Jorden. I mean Jayden. That's better. For this surprise Jorden can't know. Happy Anniversary. You're looking for the Lone Wolf, Charlie. Well, I am looking for someone, yes. There are trails and mountains. Your Grandmother must know. You have her picture? Yes. Fluttering Dove must know, she'll tell you about Lone Wolf. Who is the Lone Wolf, Aunt Dida? I can't see, can't feel. Just the darkness of his soul. You have to track him, I can't help you. I wish Grandmother was alive. The Fluttering Dove is alive. In our hearts. Talk to her. Ask her. Thank you Aunt Dida. Goodbye. So, anything new? Like what? I don't know... surprises? Trips? Anything? Cece what are you talking about? I would tell you if something was up. No, nothing is up. Nothing? Okay. I get it. Get what? Nothing. Jorden. Nevermind. Charlie Black. Charlie, any updates? None yet, Cece. It's just a dead end. How about with you? Nothing. Well, we're celebrating our anniversary. It's a surprise. I'm not supposed to tell anyone, but you don't count. Jeez thanks Cece. What are you guys gonna do? He won't tell me. It's a surprise, it's very mysterious. - I'm meeting him in Red Hook. - Really? Yeah, it sounds very sexy. I gotta run. I don't wanna give it away. - Bye. - Give what away? Cece... Jorden... Were you dating a lot? I mean before we met? No. Here and there. Why? Just wondering. About what? Nothing. What do you wanna ask me? You're really attractive. You must have had a lot of girlfriends. Not really. No time. - No? - No. Not much really worked out. Hey! What the hell are you doing here? - You better have a damn good excuse. - It's not what you think I'm calling 911. Cece's in danger! - Excuse me? - She's being kidnapped as we speak! What are you talking about? You have a twin brother. Where is he? How'd you know that? I haven't spoken to him in years. - He's the Lone Wolf! - What? He's been killing your girlfriends for years. Why? Oh my god. Jayden had this beautiful girlfriend. I mean gorgeous. And uh, she used to hang out with us a lot. He was happy. And I resented his happiness. So one day she came by. Thought I was him. I went with it. And... One thing led to another. He came in on us. You know... - Where did he go? He has Cece! - I don't know, I don't talk to him! He never spoke of anything? Anywhere? His loft. It was in an old factory wearhouse. - In Red Hook? - Near the Gowanus Canal. Okay I have a number: 18. Does it mean anything? That could be the number to his loft. Okay. Anything else at all? Please. There's this black gate. A black gate? There's this picture of uh, three squirrels. Three squirrels? Okay I have to go. Where are you going? A loft. Red Hook. Three squirrels. Loft 18. Let me come with you! Yeah. We got another one. Mmm hmm. She's pretty. I'd definitely say Jorden did a good job. Oh, I didn't forget about you. Who's laughing now Jorden? You guys have always been there for me. Mmm hmm. Okay. You think we could extract some of her teeth? That's a new one. I've never tried that before. Okay, okay. Alright. You're too smart for him. He's a waste for you. He can't even keep a relationship. I know that firsthand. He doesn't deserve a woman like you, Cece. He doesn't. Doesn't at all. Ugh I'm sorry it had to come to this. Blame him! Jorden... Which one should I use? Old reliable? No. You're right. She's better than that. Well... Cheers to you, Cece. It's been a pleasure. Well, what about this one? Cece!
