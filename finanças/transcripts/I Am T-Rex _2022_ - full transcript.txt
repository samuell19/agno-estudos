65 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period, every continent on earth was ruled by a mysterious and massive group of reptilian creatures that were the planet's rightful overlords. Fierce predators of the land, sea, and sky. Jarrett, come over here. Hmm? Whoa, Dad! You always make hunting look so easy! And once you are as old and mighty as I am, you can hunt by yourself, too. Huh? I don't think so. I don't ever wanna grow up. But hey! I'll still be cheering for you no matter how big I get! Heyah, everyone! I'm Jarrett, and I'm a super-duper cute T-Rex. The big guy behind me is my dad, Logan! He's the King of Green Valley! I may be small now, but I know that one day, I'll be just as tough and strong as he is, and that's pretty cool! I don't wanna grow up super fast, though. Being on Patrol with my dad is always so fun! Huh? Whoa! - Jarrett! Don't touch it! - Huh? But it smells just fine! And it's pretty. Huh? Jarrett, remember, the prettier the mushroom in the jungle, the more poisonous it is. Huh? Poisonous? It can't be that dangerous. I'm more scary than a... What was that? Hmm. Let's go. - Hmm? - But Dad, I... Are you sure? Jarrett, you are a mighty T-rex. The only way to rid yourself of fear is to face it bravely. Hmm? Uh-oh. What do we do? Quick, follow me. Hold on! Dad, wait! Dad! Where are we even going? Oh. Hmm... Dad, please! You're going too fast! Wait for me! Jarrett, this may be dangerous. Hide as soon as we get there! Hey, keep crying like that and the meat will go bad. Be considerate. Stop crying! Big Dan! How come you always get the juiciest meat? What, is that an issue? Let's trade then. Mom! Don't worry, I'll make it quick for you. Who is this guy? Who cares? Don't freak out. Fools, how dare you trespass here! You jerk. You just ruined my dinner! Huh? You three have some nerve, don't you? First, you disturb my kingdom's peace. Then, you have the audacity to disrespect me. You're back! Good thing for us! Allow me to introduce you to our boss, Fang! Not that he really needs an introduction. Did I just hear you say this land is yours? That's right! My dad's the King of the Green Valley! Hmm? The King you say? Uh... We have rules to keep the peace and I do not excuse ignorance! How cute. Where I'm from, we have a rule of our own! It's as simple as the strongest live, while the weak die. Hey, Boss, maybe it's best we don't pick a fight right now. This guy probably has friends. If there are more like him, we're done for. Play nice for now. Catch him off guard, then strike. Y-yeah, Fang! Plus, I'm hurt, look at my poor leg. Y-ya see, your Majesty, we're new here, just looking for food, not some petty fight. We promise to respect your laws and your land. Next time, you will not find me as forgiving. Now off with you! Jarrett, we're leaving. Huh? Dad! I was wondering... Why'd you let those guys go? I know you could have easily beaten 'em up, and taught 'em a lesson! Jarrett, if one were to only respond with violence, it would become a vicious cycle with no end. We must be better. I will always do my best to show mercy. A King who leads with hate in his heart, is no King at all. Wow! Shooting stars! Let's make a wish! C'mon, Dad, make a wish! So, what did you wish for? I wish that I could stay with you forever, so no matter how scared I get, you could always protect me. That's my wish. How about you? Bet your wish was cool! I wish, my boy will become strong, and confident, unafraid to face the world. Do you really think I can do all that? Of course, you're my son after all. Ben, I'm still a bit worried. Just promise me one thing, that you'll keep an eye on him. Of course. We'll catch up later. Huh? Ow. Huh? Well, that's mean! Huh? That hurt! Wow! Huh? Whoa! Oh, so cool! There are so many eggs around here! Stop! Thief! Uh... W-wait, I'm not a... I'm no thief, I swear! Get away! Dad! Dad! Help me! Is that Jarrett? Jarrett! I was just looking! You won't fool me! There's nowhere to run now! What do you think you're doing to my son? Jarrett, are you all right? Oh, Dad, I'm so glad you're here! And here I thought the T-Rex were supposed to protect us all! Yet all this time, you've been dirty egg thieves! You've made a mistake. My son knows better than to steal. I wasn't gonna eat 'em, I promise! I was about to sneeze and then you started chasing after me! That was a sneeze? What kind of fool do you take me for? You T-rex do nothing but terrorize us. We can't bear it anymore! This has happened before? That's impossible. Oh, really? You want proof? One of your friends brought these three crazy deinonychus with him to snatch my eggs! I was attacked trying to protect them. Later, lady! That sounds like Fang's group! Hmm. Yes, I agree. I assure you that those thieves are in no way friends of ours. You have my word that I will find them, and make this right. I want to believe you, but it's no longer safe. At least not here in Green Valley. I've already chosen to leave once the baby is born. I just can't take the risk here. I'm really sorry. - Hmm. Let's get moving, son. - 'Kay. Don't run. Hey, you two, get over here and stop this guy! Here, Boss! This one's nice and tender! Fang, back down! You again? Must get a kick out of ruining my day! I've already warned you once, yet you continue to cause havoc. Who made you King anyways? Did you forget? Our rules are set by the strongest and fiercest. I suggest a change in leadership. - What do you say to that, boys? - Yeah. It's you again! You may have fooled me yesterday, but I've got ya this time! Huh? Huh? That roar... It's Dad! It sounds like he's in danger! Don't worry, I'm coming! Dad! Hey! Isn't that the runt? I've always been curious what a T-Rex tastes like! A bite won't hurt, right? Hmm? Huh? Mister Ben, put me down! I gotta find my dad! Jarrett, listen to me! Fang is too powerful! There's nothing you can do. I'm so sorry. Dad... Don't be scared, keep still. I have you! Uncle Ben! Dad, no... Dad, please... All right, wake up! Hmm? Hmm? Where am I? Hey, Dad? Where did you go? Mister Ben? Help, I'm lost! What do I do? Hi! Are you looking for me? 'Cause you smell like a very tasty start to my day! Hurry up and follow me this way! You can run, but you can't hide! Huh? Now, there's no chance you're getting away, brat! Now go left! Come on, kid! This isn't over! That was too close. Crazy situation, crazy place! My name's Cai by the way! What brings you here? Cai? What's so funny about my name? I just saved your life, didn't I? Oops! I meant to say thanks! My name is Jarrett! I'm starving. I know a place with tons of food! For real? I can't wait! Oh. Is this what you call food? Sorry. I forgot that you eat meat. Huh? Hey, stop! Huh? Huh? There's a fish! I know I can catch you! Hmm? Huh? The prettier the mushroom in the jungle, the more poisonous it is. Don't eat it. Don't even look! Come on, a nibble can't hurt. Hmm? Hmm... It smells... smells just like meat! You aren't gonna eat me or somethin', are ya? I'm the bird who saved your life! Hmm? I told you it smelled just like meat... look! Somethin' doesn't seem right about this. Oh! Hey! Jarrett, come back! This is the best! Huh? Where'd you come from, brat? How dare you steal my meal! No, no, no, I-I didn't know it was yours, I-I was just hungry! Get out of here! And don't come back! Uh-oh. Sure looks good! I think I'm going to finish every single bite! What a liar! He can't finish it all. That's too big, even for him! That was good. He ate it all. He didn't even leave me any scraps. Hmm? All right, kid, if you're that hungry, then dig in. Huh? Thanks Mister, I'm Jarrett! Mister? I really don't look that old, do I? My name is Lucas. Jeez, you have quite a big appetite, don't you, kid? Then tomorrow, you'll be doing the hunting. Way to go, Thunder-feet. Huh? You're not making this hunt very easy. Do me a favor and stay out of the way! Huh? Hmph. I don't need you, I'll do it on my own! Huh? That didn't work. The shell's too hard. Okay! You win! Huh? How'd it go? Not so great, I'm so bad at this. Expected that. For a T-Rex, you may be strange, but that doesn't mean you're hopeless. So kid, tell me about yourself. Where's home for you? I... I am from Green Valley. Green Valley? I heard once the T-rex there are fearless, especially the King. That's my dad! But I. Huh? My dad was attacked and I did nothing. I wanna be strong but what am I supposed to do? Lucas, I want to be strong like him. Can you help me? Yes. If you're serious, then we start tomorrow. I'll be strong like you, Dad. We're going to be starting with your agility and reflexes. You need to move! Observe... and dodge! Follow me. Wow. Huh? Now, look close. Whoa, that's cool! Don't just stand there. Show me what you got. Uh... Watch me. Plant your feet. Stay low and steady. Use the strength from your waist to keep balance, and with all that power, fling your tail! Now it's your turn! Plant the feet. Low and steady. Power up. And fling! Hmm... Keep going! Mm-hm. Today is all about endurance. Huh? It's so high up, there's no way we can climb this. Well, I believe we can. Cast your doubt aside and just go! C'mon Jarrett, get moving! T-that's a long way down. You have claws! Use em! Finally. Yup. Ya made it. Whoa! Even though it was hard, it was sure worth the view. The kid's on his own today. Hope the hunt's going smooth. Huh? Hey Jarrett, what's up? Stay quiet. Please, don't... don't hurt me! I lost my mom! Aww! We'll help you find her, kid! It's those jerks again! What can I do? Careful, Jarrett! Don't do anything impulsive! What are you babbling about? Get out of the way! Don't go over there, come back! Stop! Oh, it's just you. Surprised you're still alive! It's the runt! Nice! It's a two-for-one special! It's been a while. What's taking him so long? - Lucas! Jarrett's in trouble! - Huh? Big Dan! Fang has been lookin' for this kid. What are the odds? We got him right where we want him. All we gotta do is take him straight to the boss! Well then, what are we waiting for? Hold on, Jarrett! I'm almost there! Stay strong! You're fast! For a brat! Get away! Its's okay. Whatever you say. Good job, kid. We have our meal. I'll even leave some for you this time. But... there's no way we can eat him, Lucas! Just look at him! He doesn't even know where his mom is! So what? I'm starving here! What else are we supposed to eat? Jarrett, get outta the way! Before I move you! Mm-mm. Fine then, just go! Huh? Uh... This time, don't come back! He left. I don't believe it. You're Jarrett, right? Thanks for the help. I'm Lex, by the way. So now what? Huh? Follow me. These are so good! Earlier, you weren't hurt, right? Just a scratch or two. It was nothing. So Lex, how did you get here? I know you got lost but how exactly? We Brachiosaurus migrate each year. Somehow, I got separated from my mom and panicked. But before I even had time to think, those three boneheads had me surrounded. Do you have any idea where your mom might be? I'm not sure. There is one clue! The North Star! The Brachiosaurus always follow it! Sounds like a good start! Oh! Over there! I think I see it! Mm-hm. If we follow this direction, we'll find your mom in no time! Come on! Big Dan, I-I kinda wanna go back. I'm sorta scared of the dark. Ya know, if I could see anything, I'd slap you! We're supposed to be predators. This is embarrassing! Hey, Big Dan! I totally just found those two kids on the hillside! Are you sure it's just them? Yeah! No one to stop us this time! All right, Boys! Let's try again. Now's our big chance. Don't mess it up! Over there! Is that your herd, Lex? We did it! We found them! Awesome! Yeah! Great, ya found em. But we just found you! Quick! We gotta run! Sorry, kids! You two brats ain't goin' nowhere! You go find your mom, I'll distract these guys! What about you? Just go! Huh? Hmm? You little... Huh? Get them! Big Dan! I'm getting away! Distracting us, eh? Fine, you little rat. If you want us to catch you first, let's do it! - Stop! - Hey! Just slow down, please! Gotcha! Too bad. We're too fast. Well, I am. I'm... so tired. Now! Take this brat down to the canyon! - Yep, you got it! - Yep, you got it! So, can I eat him now? No, you pig! I have a plan, remember? Forget your gut! So, how do we get the big guy here? Easy. One of you guys will need to go lure him back here. Now then. Who's going to be our volunteer? Hmm... Big Stan! So brave! Didn't think you had it in ya! Wait, what? I... I don't feel qualified for this! Good luck! We believe in you! - Why have you returned? - Huh? Answer me! Uhm, so I might have Jarrett. Huh? W-W-What I meant to way is... Big Dan has him! Cowards! What have you three done with Jarrett? Nothing yet, I swear! I'm just the messenger, ya know? You're taking me to him. Right now! What's taking him? I bet you he got lost again. Quick, they're here! Hide! He-he's right up here! Jarrett? Jarrett! Are you okay? We should probably shut this guy's big mouth. Let's get his attention, yeah? My, what a small world we live in. Good to see you again. You! What are you up to? Ya better move quick! Yeah? Or else what? So glad you asked. No! I have to help him! Kid! You okay? Wake up! It seems like he's a little tired. Also, I've got you right where I want you. Hit it! Uh-oh! Jarrett! Big Dan, I think we got em! There's absolutely no way they survived that. Now that would be just totally crazy, wouldn't it? Quiet, Numb Skull! Now that that's over, I think it's time we tell Fang. Lucas? Lucas? Wake up! Jarrett, glad you're safe. Are you hurt? I'm fine! I'm sorry. This is all my fault. Stop. It's okay. We should focus on getting out of here. Hey! Jarrett! Huh? No way! Lex, it's you! I'm over here! I'm over here! Jarrett, are you okay? We're fine! But we're trapped behind these rocks! I need you to back away! Lex, you did it! You found your mom! - Mm-hm. - Whoa. You guys are tall! By the way, how'd you know we were here? I was looking everywhere for you. Suddenly, I heard a huge crash coming from this direction. You're lucky we heard anything at all. - Jarrett, we have to get going. - Yeah! We owe you one! Okay! Sorry, Lex, I gotta go. Thank you so much for helping us. No, thank you! Seriously. Without you, I wouldn't have found my mom again! Bye. You say your goodbyes? It sure took ya long enough, kid. Did you miss me? - No. - Don't be shy. I won't tell anyone. All right, kid. If you really want to beat Fang, you need to get stronger. As you are now, you don't stand a chance. Come and get me! Huh? Wow. Is that really the best you can do? Get up! Very good, Jarrett. You've grown. Hmm? Jarrett, thought you should know there's a fight going down in the brush! It's Lucas! It's gotta be! Hmm. It looks like him. But I'm not really sure! Hey! So impatient. Uh, right behind you! Whoa! Those moves... so familiar. They don't seem special to me. Same stance as Lucas. Reverse attack. Now attack the side. Hmm? Wow, you guessed his move. Wait for me! Sorry, but I was wondering do you know someone named Lucas? Lucas? Why? Uh... Y'see, I've been looking for him for a long time now! Lucas' father was the King of Dragon Valley. Naturally, Lucas was recognizedas the next heir to the throne. But Lucas knew that his brother, Leon, had always wanted to be a King, like his father. To honor his brother's wish, Lucas surrendered his claim to the throne and left our home. He hasn't been seen since. I had no idea. Yeah. Name's Rowan by the way. Could you take me to Lucas? Sure, I'll help! I'm Jarrett. And I know you didn't ask, but I'm Cai! Nice to meet you! Lucas! Come here! I've brought you quite the surprise! I doubt that you could surprise me. Huh? What? See what I mean? Told ya so! Lucas. It really is you! Whatever it is, forget it. Dragon Valley is in danger! No, Leon is King. He can keep you safe. The King has been overthrown! No way! What on earth is happening there? It's Kru! He invaded the Valley. His resistance overpowered the King! No... Lucas, please. The Valley, no, Leon needs you. I can't help you. Lucas! Just give him some time, okay? What are you so worried about? Never seen you like this. Very funny. Is this your pep talk? Not what I had in mind. I just wanna give you some advice. If you have the power to make a change, you probably should. I know what it's like to run away. You can't run from this. Lucas, do what you must to protect your home. Be brave, my son. Lucas. Dragon Valley needs you. Where is everyone? Hmm? I'll look ahead! Something's wrong. Lucas, it's been a long time. Kru, it's you! Hey, relax. I thought we were supposed to be friends. Is that your idea of a joke? No-no-no-no, not a joke. Wow, I figured such an old friend would be thrilled about attending my coronation tomorrow. Unless, there's an issue. Well, let's settle that. Face me one-on-one and let fate decide. In return, I'll even spare your brother's life! - Uh... - What? What have you got to lose? But... better make sure you don't disappoint me. Oh, we won't. Tomorrow. You and I. At the sun's first light. Great! See you then. Let's go, boys. Lucas. Lucas, wake up! Huh? Rowan, what do you need? Is something wrong? Rowan, where are we going? Just follow me! Hmm? Stop! Tell me where we're going! Rowan, what are you hiding from me? Out with it! Kru, he has my son. So I struck a deal with him. Lucas, please understand, I had no other choice! I... I was to lead you away from the valley. Now, you'll miss the fight and guarantee his victory. All right. Silence. Silence! Tell me, whatever happened to that big coward Lucas? I was expecting a fight! What are you doing, Lucas? Since there are no objections, I, Kru, will be your new King! Long live the great King! I object! You'll fight me instead! You aren't serious, are you, brat? This is nothing but proof that Lucas is a coward! So be it. - Oh. - Huh? Fine then, I'll do it myself! - Sorry I'm late. - Huh? Lucas! You're here! You came! Fine, it doesn't matter. Lucas, you look tired. I don't want others to think I won unfairly! Lucas, are you okay? Yeah, I'll deal with him. You save the kids. Hmm? Hope you're ready. Come on! Keep an eye on 'em! I have a plan! Good thinking! Here goes nothing! Ha! Got ya! Ow! That hurt, ya dumb bird! How dumb can you be? He got ya twice in a row! Somehow, I'll get you! Good luck! Come back here! Rowan? What are you doing here? I'm here to help you, boy! Let's go rescue the others! Hey Lucas, once I'm finished with you, your brother is next. Lucas! Mama! Papa! What are you doing, you fools? I am your King! You must obey me! You wouldn't dare rebel against me! Never come back! Lucas, I... There's no need to apologize. This time, I'll be sure to join my brother in Dragon Valley. We're going to work together to restore it to its former glory. Jarrett! - Huh? - Jarrett! It's Mister Ben! Jarrett, is it really you? I've been looking everywhere for you! Oh, you've grown! It's good to see you! I'm doing great. Jarrett, I have some news. Fang has done nothing except destroy our peaceful home. Since becoming King, he and his group have become more ruthless than ever! Almost all of the other dinosaurs have left, afraid for their lives. Green Valley is no longer the safe, beautiful place it used to be. Jarrett, we need you to come back! Green Valley needs you, son! Long ago, I went stargazing with Dad, he made a wish that I'd be unafraid to face the world. Everybody has a role in life, now as for me, mine is to guard Dragon Valley and my family. What do you think yours is, kid? You gotta make that choice, just like I did mine. You once said, if you have the power to make a change, then you should make it. Jarrett, you are so brave. You alone have the power to choose your path. I'm confident you'll make the right choice. Jarrett, we believe in you. All right, son? Yeah. Thanks. Let's go. Well, well, well, you gave us quite a chase, didn't ya? Bet you wish your pops were here. Too bad! This was too easy! At least it wasn't me this time! Huh? Lo-Lo-Lo-Logan? There's no way! I-Is that really Logan? Give me ten good reasons why I shouldn't stomp you three? No, no! You're not Logan! No, I'm not. I am his son, Jarrett. But we buried you in the canyon! You're right. I climbed all the way out so I could find you three. No, please! Have mercy on us! We never meant to do it, I swear! We were forced to by Fang! That's right! Fang is the guy you want! - Please forgive us! - Yeah! We're super, super sorry! Ya know, we've been wanting to overthrow Fang for years now! But... he's so strong! And your dad, it was nothing personal, he was just a victim! Come on, give us a chance? Look, let's make a deal. You don't hurt us and we'll take you to Fang. Uh, yeah, we'll take ya there, no tricks! Uh-huh! Yeah, what they said! Kids, get out of here! Go find Fang! Tell him we're coming! Isn't this the place where Fang and your father fought back in the day? We all have such vivid memories of your dad's bravery, boy. Fang always boasts and brags about how he defeated your father here! It's just so cruel! You've made a terrible choice, just like your father! Well, at least you'll be joining him now. This ends today! Tough talk! Especially since Daddy's not here to save you. Come on! Is that all you've got, boy? How sad can you be? You really think you could be King? Keep your crown. I'm here to stop you, that's all! You act like a tyrant and terrorize our valley while destroying everything you touch! You never deserved to be King! Shut your mouth! Hold on. Where'd your crew run to, Fang? Miss us, guys? What? Suppose you can call this a coup, eh, boss? It's almost freaky how familiar this feels, right? I sorta feel like I've traveled back in time! Except this time, we end up in charge! Yeah! This timeline rocks! I think Big Dan is gonna make a great King! Don't you? You bunch of traitors! Attack! Fang, you may have my kingdom today. But you must promise to protect it. Hah! What is this, some sort of joke? I'm not falling for it! Look out! He was the true King, Jarrett. I'm so sorry. But now I know for sure. A real King would lead with kindness, not... this. You can't even defend yourself! This is pathetic! You wanna know somethin' really sad, though? Years ago, we were just using Fang to distract the King, maybe snag a few eggs! But to our surprise, and to our benefit, it ended with the King falling face-first off a cliff! What? And now, our grand plan comes to its conclusion! I should have never done this. Green Valley needs a King that is strong and true! What're you saying? Jarrett, I hope you can forgive me for the pain I've caused you. Stop! Fang, no! Jarrett, the kingdom is yours. Run!
