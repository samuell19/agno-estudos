I grew up in South Central. Gangs, guns, and hip-hop all waiting to explode. Welcome to my neighborhood. Dr. Dre, N.W.A. Homeboy conquering heroes. I'm proud of 'em. We all are. They're like icons who know how to do it. Straight outta Compton and into the world. Everybody keeps asking me, "Girl, why you ain't in their movie? You was there. "You was down with Ruthless Records right along with them boys." That movie ain't about me. That's them telling the story they want to tell. History gets told by the winners. I got my own history, my own story, about a girl from the 'hood. I am MICHEL'LE. It started when I was little. The seeds of hip-hop. Cops busting brothers for just being black. Gangs replacing families. Music trading smooth melody for hard-core rhythm tracks. Hip-hop was waiting to explode. And even back then in Compton, the fuse was already lit. Why did you lose your lunch box? Losing things, huh? I can't afford that! I grew up in South Central. It seemed like somebody was always getting hit. Keep trying to tell you... Meme, when I get grown, I ain't never going to let no man put his hands on me like that. So you say. When a man hits a woman, it's because, well, his hands are working faster than his brain. And a woman might be smarter, but she's still going to get hit. Never make a man want to hit you. And if you do, then you fix it. And you fix yourself fast, hear me? So many of the decisions you make in life depend on what you was taught as a child. As soon as I could fake looking 18, I got a full-time job working at May Company. ♪ We're on the shores of nowhere ♪ Looking out to sea ♪ I turn and kiss your face and you laugh at me ♪ You laugh at me ♪ How do I feel when I feel like ♪ When I feel like saying ♪ Feel so good, so right ♪ To be with you tonight ♪ So good, so right ♪ To be with you tonight ♪ So good, so...

We're going to take it from the top. - Bye, guys. - That was cool. Thanks, you guys are awesome. Listen, MICHEL'LE, you did great. You did really great. I wasn't expecting that. Thank you. And thanks for having me. I had so much fun. Thanks for coming. I guess I was a little rude at first, huh? Yeah, you were. But I'm over it. Good night, Andre. No, it's just Dre.

Hello? Yeah, who is this? For the next three weeks, they called me every morning. Hello? It was sweet. First Dre would call, then Eazy, then Dre. They were both trying hard to win my attention. What?

It was almost like a Compton rite of passage. So your new boyfriend won't come inside, huh? He's just tired, Meme. He's been up all night working on tracks. Sign says when a man sleeps in his car, he got a woman pregnant somewhere. Well, your signs are a little off, Meme, because I'm definitely not pregnant, and Dre's ex just had her baby a few weeks ago. Signs don't lie. My grandma's signs were right. After he just had Val's baby, he had another one. Boy or girl? Twins, maybe? Look, I messed up, all right? I should have told you. I just wasn't thinking about it. You really think that makes it better, Dre? What do you want from me? The truth. Was you sleeping with her the same time you been sleeping with me? Hell, no. Do the math, girl. It takes nine months to make a baby. We only been together for five. Look, we good. MICHEL'LE, we good. Everybody else, that was before. Before you. You're gonna take care of him, right? I'll take care of all of them. How many "all"? Look, I... I had three. It was just three. Then Val's baby, now this one. So, five. You really got five kids. Yeah. I think so. "Think so." Now who can't do the math? Look, MICHEL'LE, I didn't take any of those girls seriously, okay? But you, baby, it's different. Right. I'm not pregnant, Dre. Look, I'm trying to say something here.

Baby, we going to fly. And when I fly, you fly too. We can make it out of these streets, out of being broke, and damn sure straight out of Compton. Eazy rapped about stuffin' women. So why was it funny? Because Eazy was funny. We needed to laugh. Yeah, I'm laughing. Shit was funny. But you had to be there to get it. To feel it.

Dre, I think that you have a prodigious talent. It's a huge talent in a very small box. The stuff you're doing with rap now, that's amazing. All right? But I think this is just the beginning. I think there's no limit for you. When we get back, I want to show you and MICHEL'LE the world you've been missing. What do you mean? You're going to have money now, honey.

Women been singing their pain for as long as there's been music. Women voices let the world know exactly what hurt them and why. But in rap, the women stop singing. And without their voices to anchor their truths, the women were just bitches to be slapped and/or ho's to be passed around. Rap was about rage, not beauty.

Put it on, Dre. It's beautiful. Lovely. You should put that on your next album cover. See, I put money in my artists. Not Jheri curls. I got to get back to the grill. Thank you. All right, baby. Hmm. You got a winner. It's a party, man. Oh, shoot. Are you okay? Holy sweet Lord, baby Jesus. It's a present from Suge Knight. For real? Take this off me. I don't want nothing about that gangster hanging around my neck. Pfft. Sure, you don't got to ask me twice. Ooh! Now, everybody, it's Michel'le's birthday party. I was standing on top of the world. Or at the edge of a cliff. It's all a matter of perspective. Oh, my God, Dre! Do you feel that? Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Now, come on. We got to get out. I want to drive. Nice ride, B. Thank you. You ought to get rid of that bitch you're riding with and let a real man ride with you. Say what? Dre, calm down. They're drunk, we drunk. It don't mean nothing, baby. Yo, Dre, you want to blow me? Same reason why Cube left the group, right? Because you always trying to screw him? Dre, no. Stop. What's up, nigga? What's up? Yo, Eaz, man, we got to talk. Yeah, meet me at the office in one hour. Cool. Punk boy. You headed out again? Why don't you mind your own business? Why you got a gun, Dre? Because Suge said. You listen to Suge now? You taking tips from a thug? Well, that thug is getting our contracts back. Is that why you meeting Eazy? Ruthless Records, Eazy, Jerry. That's all history. Now we rolling with Suge. Eazy and Jerry are our friends, Dre. What about N.W.A.? Man, fuck N.W.A.! Let Jerry and Eazy go jerk each other off. Don't you think you should have talked to me about this, Dre? That necklace, was that supposed to buy me?

All right, my boy. You want to suck me off? That was amazing in there. I'm just living my dream. What about you? Are you living your dream? Yeah. Dre says we're gonna finish my album. I feel like I'm locked in a cage. And my dreams are just so far away from me. If I can get my dream, as jacked up as I am, you can get yours. Right? Yeah. Mommy, I'm hungry. Mmm. Mommy! You got to be kidding. Suge Knight. Leave a message. Suge, it's MICHEL'LE. Um... Dre's been gone for two weeks. I have no car, no keys, no cash. And he didn't pay the light bill. He let them turn our lights off. Please, just... Suge, if you could tell him that I need money. Diapers, food. The baby's out of his vitamins. Please just... Just have him call me. Damn it, Dre. What are you making? Hmm? Daddy. It's Daddy, Marcel. Come on. Let's go see Daddy. Oh, my God. Come in. Thank you, Suge. I mean, to think you came out of your house in this weather. I got kids. I know what it's like. What's up, little man? Hey. It's raining. I know it's raining. It is raining. And I want that thing. There you go. Dre's a genius, but he don't got no right to dog you the way he do. Yeah. I know. Bye, little man. We got to get you back in the studio. What's up, baby? The nice thing about prescription drugs is you don't feel nothing. The terrible thing about prescription drugs is you don't feel nothing. I was trapped. I didn't see Dre much. Vicodin, Xanax, Ambien, Zoloft were my new best friends. That night, I binged. I drank, smoked, took pills. What did it matter? It's like I took a long overdue vacation from life.

I had a baby. But I'm gonna sing again. I am. I'm going to create a new album with Death Row Records. I'm going to do that. Marcel! Marcel! Marcel! No. Marcel! Marcel! Marcel... No, please! Yo, T, T, T, T. Not her, man. It's MICHEL'LE, man. She's my friend. Yo, come on, man. Let's go. Happy graduation, asshole! Okay. I got to go. No, no. MICHEL'LE, Raise it up. Exactly.

I got to be with family, Dre. Man, take five. Dre! Look... Please! What is wrong with you? You a mess. Man, get your shit together. Dre! Don't walk out on me! MICHEL'LE, if you're serious, I can get you into rehab. They can fix you. But it's going to take work. You ready for that? Yeah. Yes. You're going to leave now. Don't tell or call anybody where you're going. How's the little man? He's safe. Listen, I'm going to make sure he has everything he needs. But you got to go. Okay? And so, Suge Knight, the man I had been so afraid of, turned out to be an angel in my life. I always thought recovery meant finding something you had lost. For me, though, it was finding strength I never had. Looking at myself, I didn't find a whole lot that made me happy. I'm sorry. I started writing every day. Lyrics, poems, apologies. Road maps for a way into a new life. I came back from the edge. I got sober, clean, healthy. Hey. Hey. Take five. Come here. Hi. Gosh, you look beautiful. Thank you, Suge. Really, I mean, you saved my life. No, only you could've done that. I just take care of my people. Look who's healthy and strong. What's up? What's going on? What's going on? I'm awesome. Suge. You heard my new track? Man, you ain't never getting no airplay with that. Suge, fuck airplay, man. This is my truth, man. This is how I'm feeling. I bet you if Dre was here, Dre would've been like... Yo, Dre ain't here! You want to talk about truth? Truth is, I pay for your time. You'd be nothing but a broke-ass, unknown baby rapper if it wasn't for me. So, fix the hook. When you ready, we can start on your album. I'm ready now. Great. I got some songs for you I picked out. Suge, you know I've always written my own songs. That wasn't writing. That was improvising off of Dre's half-assed tracks. I'm talking about crossing over into, like, pop stardom. I'm talking about Janet Jackson, Whitney. Come on. Okay. I mean, whatever you say, Suge. I really just can't believe how big he is. Yeah. Here you go, baby. Thanks, Meme. Rehab was so good. It really gave me time to just think about me, and what I want, and what I need. You know, what's best for Marcel. Oh, MICHEL'LE. I think I've been teaching you the wrong things. About men. Your life wasn't like mine. It just wasn't. Today's woman has got to stand up for herself. Don't you ever let that goddamn Dre hit you again. I'm not going back to Dre, Meme. Finally. Phew! It's a damn shame that heifer gonna get all your stuff. You didn't tell her? Tell me what? Uh... Dre got engaged soon after you left. The wedding's this Thursday. T, I don't care. I've spent enough of my life talking about Dre, okay? The best thing about Dre is right there, playing with them toys. Is it okay if he just stays a little bit longer? You know, just until I feel strong, Meme. I... I really don't want to mess up again. Of course he can. Come here. Thank you. What do you want? Wow! Man... You look amazing. You got no business here, Dre. We got a kid together. And you still don't use Marcel's name. I just want to talk. You going to let me in or what? Thank you. Man... This is real nice. What you doing here, Dre? You know, when you left, things changed. I heard about your wedding. Congratulations. I ain't talking about them changes. It's Death Row. Suge. You know, he's trying to control me and break me down. But I'm breaking loose. I'm starting my own label. Aftermath. You know, Pac. He hates Suge. He wants in with me. I want you to come, too. We're gonna start your album... And what, Dre? You know me better than anybody, MICHEL'LE. We've been through so much together. Baby, we ain't got to end things now. Okay? Okay? Get out, Dre. Who you with? Suge? Not Suge! Are you fucking Suge Knight? Dre, get out, or I'm calling the police. And this ain't Compton. They come real quick here. You know, you making a mistake. So this... So, this is how we going to end this? Go home to your wife, Dre. And he was gone. And I was free. You look beautiful. And armed. Can I come in? Yeah. Yeah. People ask me if I slept with Suge to punish Dre. I didn't. People ask me if I slept with Suge to pay him for his kindness to me. And that's not true either. Suge was kind, at least in the beginning. And kindness was new. I slept with him because I wanted to. I'm a big man with big appetites. I already got a wife. I don't need another one. If you'd be my lady, a part of my city, I'd make sure you'd want for nothing. Let's do the math here. Dre offered great sex, brilliance, no respect, chaos, violence, hidden baby mamas. Whereas Suge offered kindness, generosity, limited sex, job security, access to power, and a chance at a dream I thought was dead. So, hate me if you want to. I said yes. 25-year-old rapper was in the back seat of a black BMW, part of an informal convoy of 10 cars, when Las Vegas police say shots were fired from a passing white Cadillac. Turns out the same night Pac was shot, Suge violated his parole by getting into a fight. Cops saw it all on video. The judge gave Suge five years. My name is Peter Fenkel. I handle business matters for Suge Knight. This is your security detail, ma'am. Security? What? No, this is my house. I don't need no bunch of security running around... This house belongs to Suge Knight. Here are his rules. When most people go to jail, their presence in the outside world gets weaker. It was not that way with Suge. Mr. Knight wants you to help manage Death Row while he's indisposed. Indisposed? He's in jail, not on a toilet. I want to talk to him. He's not allowed visitations yet. I'll let you know when it's time. I don't like this. Look, you'll be paid $30,000 a month to follow his orders, as delivered through me. Thirty grand a month? Sign here. I was not to make or attempt contact with Dre or Tichi. Suge even restricted visits with my own grandmother. For one year, I didn't see Suge. I had plenty of money, nowhere to go, and nothing to spend it on. You look beautiful, baby. I missed you, girl. You look really good, Suge. I didn't notice you say you miss me. Suge, it's just the detail you sent me, it's too much. I just kind of feel like... I just kind of feel like I'm... What, a prisoner? There's people out there that want me dead. And the closest thing to get to me is to get to you. But, look, the good news is, you'll be able to visit every weekend during the duration of my stay. Suge... I have my son on weekends. I remind you, he's paying you $30,000 a month. Time's up. See you next weekend. On Thursdays, I went to jail. It was like clockwork, week after week. But, Marcel's seventh birthday was falling on the weekend. I was determined to give him a party. So, I decided to visit Suge a day early so I could get back in time. Visitor for Marion Knight. What are you doing here? This is my day. Your day for what? Don't try that. This has been my day for the past year. Year? Suge always said that he would take Dre's label and his bitch. You ain't nothing but a trophy. You don't get shit, do you? Hey! What the hell? Are you kidding me? I was here first. Calm down, ma'am. This is not fair. I can escort myself. You disobeyed me. I got the things the way they are for a reason. But you didn't ask me... I'm sorry. If you would have, I would have told you any days but Thursday through Sundays were fine. But you didn't ask me. I can't do this anymore, Suge. But you can keep your money. I'll move out. Who do you love most, MICHEL'LE? Huh? Is it your grandmother? Your little boy, Marcel? Is it your friend Tichina? I bet it's Marcel. He played T-ball today, right? 4:00 p.m.? Dre's son. Great Dre's son. Thursday through Sunday is completely fine, Suge. I want to marry you, girl. What? But, Suge, you're already married. It's been taken care of. Taken care of? Suge... Divorced. Annulled, actually. Well, I'm flattered, Suge, really. But, I just don't think... You don't have a choice. I need you, and you owe me. I can't run my business out there without someone I can legally trust. Okay. What about your Tuesday bitch? She already married. Look, we get married, and from then on, we can meet every week at the cottage. Conjugal visits. Mrs. Knight. The Good Ship Lollipop had just become the Titanic. I was so excited. Not for him, for me. Hey! For his release meant my freedom, too. I could have my life back. This was his homecoming, but it was my getting-out party. Oh! Lights out. He's coming, he's coming. Surprise! Baby, welcome home. Who that? How much is this going to cost me? Just have a drink. Welcome home. All right, keep the music up. Hi. Out of my way! Who's ripping off Death Row? After prison, Death Row had financial troubles. Suge was not happy. I'm not going down like this! Get my car. What's this, motherfucker? See that right there? Death Row. That's me. Suge Knight. What the fuck you standing here for? Get my car. Man, get my car! So, Suge, you say you need product. What about my album, Hang Tyme? It's finished, and it hasn't been released. You're going to bring that shit up? Yeah, I was just waiting on the right time. Fuck your album! Talking about singing about you in love with the wrong man? You talking about Dre, aren't you? You're hurting me. Hurting? You living on my dime, eating food that I paid for, and you talking about loving about Dre? Huh? Bitch! Give us a minute. Listen, I told nothing to 'em. We was playing football. You got hit with a pass, hear me? Football. You got hit with a football. All right? Sir, we need to get going. All right, don't tell 'em nothing else. Footballs don't leave ring prints. Tell the police. Take his ass back to jail. What good will it do? Suge in jail is just as powerful as Suge out of jail. Mmm-mmm-mmm. It ain't right. If you don't leave, your ass gonna get killed. No, I won't. Why? You got superpowers? Huh? You hear me? Suge loves kids. What? Kids? No. What y'all girl talking about? Oh, my God! I was pregnant. That's what saved me. My baby girl's name is Bailei. And while I was trying to be the best mom I could be to her... I'm going to court. Make sure you bring the baby. I want the judge to know I'm a family man. Six months. Suge was out thugging and getting arrested. I saw my chance. I took Bailei and moved back in with Grandma. Then all hell broke loose. MICHEL'LE Knight, you're wanted from the U.S. Department of Justice. Go ahead and put that down. That's evidence. Are you aware that there are three houses and 42 cars bought by Mr. Knight in your name? I didn't know. As Mr. Knight's wife, the court would hold you responsible for his debts. Do you recognize these? Um... Yeah, it's the papers and stuff Suge's lawyer told me to sign when we were getting married. Well, Miss Toussaint, these papers are bogus. You were never legally married to Marion Knight. He never divorced his wife. You son of a bitch. You're back. Bitches always come back. You weak, selfish, lying thug. Bet y'all didn't know big, bad Suge needed to hide behind a woman's titties. What the hell you talking about? It's all fake. Fake artists, fake papers, fake deals. Fake marriage. None of it was real. I got a baby on you, bitch. Bailei's real. Bailei exists 'cause God was trying to get my attention. Trying to get me to look at my own damn, pitiful life. You ungrateful, stupid bitch. I gave you everything. You gave me hell dressed up in dollar bills. I'm gonna crush you. No, you won't. 'Cause I won't let you. They coming for you, Marion. And when they do, I'm telling them every damn thing I know. You know what happens when people threaten me, right? You want to shoot me? 'Cause it's going to take more than some bullets to keep the truth from grabbing your ass. I'm not scared of you, Suge Knight. It's your turn to be scared. Baby, you deserve so much better than this world of rap and rage. This is not for you. You and your brother Marcel deserve so much better. Don't you ever let anybody hit you. No matter what, okay? And don't you ever, ever trade your freedom for security or power. You got to own yourself, Bailei. Baby, you got to own yourself. I grew up. Had to. My life became my kids. I had children to raise, to protect. Legal fines to pay, homework to check, and rent to dig up. I had to start over. And this time, I had to do it on my own and get it right. ♪ There were times ♪ I remember ♪ Had to fight ♪ Just to hold my head up ♪ Those times when even my friends tried ♪ To make a fool of me ♪ There were things that my heart attacked ♪ That they just couldn't see ♪ Some said I was hopeless ♪ Mind tangled in the night ♪ Strong hearts Just keep on going ♪ And that is why I'm still standing here today ♪ If you're lost ♪ In your troubles ♪ And the world ♪ Just seems to forget you ♪ If you remember sunshine ♪ Even on your darkest day ♪ Just follow what your heart says ♪ And you will find the way ♪ Some said that I was hopeless ♪ A mind tangled in the night ♪ Strong hearts Just keep on going ♪ That is why ♪ I'm still standing here today ♪ Come together ♪ Raise up your voices ♪ This time my song of love and life ♪ It won't go away ♪ I'll sing forever ♪ Here in the sunshine ♪ I've lived to see the sun break through the storm ♪ And I'm so glad I'm standing here today ♪ I'm standing ♪ I'm standing ♪ And I'm so glad ♪ I'm still standing here today ♪ I'm so glad I'm standing here today.
