'Thanks to all press, media internet and social media friends' 'This movie is dedicated to all the brothers and sisters who died in the caste riots.' 'Ravana's gathering' [Raavana Kottam] Guys! The Melatheru people have insulted our leader's statue! We must slit their throats! Come on! Finish off all the Keezhatheru people! [Indistinct chatter] Oh my God! They are butchering us. Run! Please, I'm begging you! Ramanathapuram district. Here, this is our motherland. We hail from a village called Enathi. Not just our village every neighbouring village flourished once upon a time... and their names are the proof. Wonder who's curse affected these flourishing villages? The rain clouds disappeared, the water bodies dried up. The lands turned barren. The scorching heat resulted in water scarcity. People has second thoughts of living in the dried up land. In rage, we revolted at the government office and confronted them. We laughed our asses off to their reply. Yes! The Karuvela tree (Prosopis juliflora) is the reason behind all this. In the beginning, even we were a little complacent. I say this because our elders had already told us about it. But... the incidents that followed up sent shivers down our spine. We were happily playing Kabaddi without knowing that death was staring at us. Kabaddi...Kabaddi... Kabaddi... Wait, let him come further in. Round him up! Come on. Come on. Round him up! - Let him come in further. - Let him advance! No! No! You didn't touch him. Show them Melatheru is better than them! Buddy, finish them off with one strike! Show them that Keezhatheru is better than them. Go! Shall we put an end to this? Of course, pangali (partner)! What do you think you're doing? Trying to instigate us? Maari told me to do so. Maari, come here! I said, come here! Well dear nephew, the match was quite exciting. I thought you'd win if we provoke you. Also we'll come to know which is the stronger side. So you want to know who is stronger among the both of us? Right? Pangali, come here. Show him your power and I'll show him mine. - Trying to create a fight amongst us? - Hit him, pangali! Aren't you all coming for the village gathering? Ayya will expect you there. He's right, pangali. Ayya will be waiting for us. You lost one hand in that village because you tried to meddle things there. Meddle here and you won't have hands to eat and teeth to chew! Come on, pangali. "Praise the God with thousands of hands" "Praise the God with thousands of hands" Dear Pushpam. Dear, my son's calling you. Coming, dear. What serial are you watching at this hour? Not serial but actor Vadivelu's comedy. Greetings, ayya. - Only you are here? - Sengu is on his way, ayya. Stop addressing me as 'ayya'. Treat me like your father. Okay, father. - By the way, where is your father? - He'll come soon. He said that he'll come soon. Greetings, father. Look at him and the holy ash on his forehead. Looks very devotional. I took a bath. Whoa! Check if it's raining outside. It might because he said he took a bath! Don't make fun of him. He regularly does it and is devotional. How'd you know? Remember we went to Ramanathapuram court last year? The hotel we stayed in, ran out of water. We were all upset thinking how we were going to bath. He shows up with holy ash on forehead, looking all fresh and devotional. We asked him how and he started laughing. Well, there's water scarcity in our village. We must save water. Hence, I got the job done using just a bottle of water. Do you apply the same logic in all your decisions? He must have rolled in dust and thus he took bath today. - Am I right? - I was playing Kabaddi. Did you all fix a date for 'Mulakattu' (Seed-sowing festival)? Yes, ayya. I've told you to refrain from such activities. Come, let's discuss. Ayya, coming 27th of Tamil month 'Purattasi' is an auspicious day. We can have 'Mulakattu' on that day. Let's have a word with Chitravel too. Let him come. Madhi, find out where is your father. - Greetings, ayya. - Please sit down. Greetings, ayya. - Boss. - What is it? - His phone's ringing. - Attend it. - He's not allowing me. - Snatch it! - Hello, who's speaking? - Who are you? Tell me that first! - First tell me who are you? - Put my dad on the call. - Let me talk. - Ayya, no issues. - I said, give it. - Hello? Hello, 'Enathi' Bose speaking. Greetings, ayya. Ayya, I work at a bar in Ramnadu. The owner of this cell phone was creating a ruckus. I have held him here. Listen, that's my friend. If he has done something wrong, come to me. I'll handle it. Instead if you do something to him... I want him here in no time! Bless us, deity Mariamma. All of you please sit. Seed-sowing festival is nothing new to you all. We conduct this festival to please the rain Gods. So I want you all to stay pure and keep our village also pure. Okay? Ayya, please remind everyone to pay the property tax. You all heard it. Do pay it on time. - What's all this, dad? - What is it? - You are embarrassing him. - Shut up. Chitravelu, come here. Forgive me. We shall conduct the 'Mulakattu' on 27th of Tamil month Purattasi. On behalf of Melatheru, I give my consent. On behalf of Keezhatheru, do you give your consent? Come on, don't divide us now. It's not dividing but respecting. You are the king of this village. You say the word and... "Everybody is a king at Ravana Kottam" "Even the crowing rooster dances to our beats" Someone's entering with their party flag! Stop! Get out from here! "Even if an army enters here, they have no say here" "Look at those beautiful girl! Watch them pass by, O buddy" "They are mesmerizing us without showing any mercy" "Think whatever make it true" "Hold the sword in reverse Come, my boy" "Why we born? Destroy the enemity" "Doors are open Come on" - Hey buddy! - Pangali! "Come...come on" "Why we born? Destroy the enemity" "Doors are open Come on" "This is the town from where the renowned personality Abdul Kalam hails from" "We help without expectations because everyone is a relative here" "It's a historical land with hundreds of legends" "The whole village is like one family under one roof" "Look at the strong youths of our village" "Test our strength, if you want to know" "We aren't afraid to hunt rabbits in the dark" "And if a lion shows up, we ain't afraid to face it" "Even if you need wild plants, you will find it stacked up right outside your house" "Think whatever make it true" "Hold the sword in reverse Come, my boy" Come on! Come on, pangali! "Think whatever make it true" "Hold the sword in reverse Come, my boy" "Why we born? Destroy the enemity" "Doors are open Come on" "Everybody is a king at Ravana Kottam" "Even the crowing rooster dances to our beats" "No one can mess with us, we are the governing body of our own village" "Even if an army enters here, they have no say here" 'Kaaliyamma' "Water scarcity is effecting every livng being here; from ant to buffaloes "Even the water is chargeable in..." "The forests turned into concrete jungles" "Do we really need to pay for attending for nature's call?"

Mic testing. 1... 2... 3... In this Enathi village, on this occasion of... 67th year of Seed-sowing festival... Hey, get that coffee powder. We extend our warm welcome to one and all. Velu, where is the document preparer. He'll come. We have 'Kaapu Kattudhal' (Festival kick-start function) tomorrow... and he's not attending calls. What's the use of having him with us? Don't worry. We'll arrange some alternative. - The MLA is here. - Now who? - The MLA. - Why is he coming here? - Useless. - Welcome. Greetings, ayya. We made you an independent candidate and voted for you, so that you'd do some good for our village, as you're one of us. But after winning the election you're dancing to the tunes of ruling party. Nothing of that sorts, ayya. Only if get along with ruling party, I can do something good for us. That's the reason, ayya. Else no one would turn their head towards us. Why are you here now? Been a year since I won the election and became an MLA in this region. I didn't win. You ayya; you helped me win. So as a token of my gratitude... I'd love to throw a feast for villagers during the seed-sowing festival, with your permission, ayya. The minister has promised to attend it. In the name of throwing a feast, you'll advertise your party all over village. Then you party people will make your way inside the village, divide and rule it. That's the plan, right? - Not at all, ayya. - You're not allowed to throw the feast. - Ayya.. - Greetings. I'll ensure there won't be any party advertising. Ayya, please. I'm bringing you coffee. Did someone order you to bring coffee? No, poor guys. I saw them toiling hard. So I made it and brought for them. Fine, serve them. - I tried my best. He isn't allowing. - Told you, he won't give permission. You shut up! - Velu, who's coming next? - No idea. Here comes the document preparer. Greetings, ayya. I was just upset about you not being here. Where were you? Leave was not getting sanctioned. I finally had to fight with them and come. - Who are they? - Relatives. - So hot! I wonder how they live here. - Yes, sir. - Welcome. - Hey, good morning. Why are you wishing 'Good morning' at sun set? Your sister-in-law is here. Won't you greet her? - Bless me. - God bless you. - What's your name? - Indira Priyadarshini. - What was that? - I wanted to name her Diana... but her daddy wanted her to be successful like Indira Gandhi. Thus he named her Indira. Sir, you are the MLA of this village. Why are you waiting for him? Come, let's go. - Get in, quick. - Careful. Get in. Is the AC switched on? Ayya... ayya... Regarding that permission to serve feast... We don't let parties advertise here even during the elections. If I find any kind of party advertising, I'll put an end to everything! Tell him to go ahead with it. Permission granted. Pangali, so you're keeping a secret from me? You're her suitor, right? Saw her mother's attitude? Her mother's a devil! She won't suit me. But the daughter seems to be nice. You mean her? If my sister finds out, that'd be it! Pangali, tell me if you like her. I'll convince your sister. Pangali, it'd be hard to lead a life with such a high maintenance girl. To hell with her! She won't suit me at all. Madhi, what's the update on your posting? It seems, it'll take another two months Somebody please step forward and show this to everyone. Bless me, deity Mariamma. To your father. Dad... Here, pangali (partner). Pangali, you want to become an SI (Sub Inspector) to fire at me? Don't say so, pangali. Come on now. I mean this fire. It got me. Ayya, he has something to say. What do you got to say? Can't you keep quiet? Forget them. Don't mind what they have to say. Quiet. Go ahead, say it. We have people from every community living in this village. Especially people from two communities are the majority. Everybody knows this. You are from Melatheru and we are from Keezhatheru. You said that nobody here is a slave to anybody. So happy to hear that. But the 'Parivattam' honour is always done by you, the Melatheru people. That's so unfair. His ancestors are the reason why we and our families are leading a good life. So, have some gratitude. How dare you desire to do the 'Parivattam' honours? If this honour is what you respect me for... then I don't want that respect! We aren't asking you to respect us as equals. We are just expecting a little respect. I'll never do that if it ends up in breaking this village's unity. - You do the honours this time. - Hey! No! Come on, what are you doing? Enough? Hope everyone's happy. He gave up 'Parivattam' honours to get applauded. Will he give up everything like this? I'm even ready to sever my head in order to keep this village's unity in tact. If you dream of stirring up a silly issue and split the village... I'll slit your throat! This is Ravana Kottam! - Mommy, please let me dance. - No! - Please mommy! I want to dance. - Behave yourself or else I'll tell daddy. What happened? Why is he crying? He wants to dance with them. All the men are dancing there. If you go, you'll get squashed in the crowd. - Are you a native of this village? - Yes, don't I look so? I'm from here, Keezhatheru. I asked because you seem to be decent and not dancing like those guys. Why judge based on that? I can't dance, hence I am not dancing. But my pangali is an excellent dance. You call this a dance? Country brute! Who was that? Who? Who? Whom are you looking for? I heard someone yell our "brute" She's calling names at your brother for dancing. Guess she forgot how wild she was dancing during her granny's funeral! And she's calling my brother "brute"? You're the brute you nut! We must do something about him! I'll take care of that. Look, your nephew is drooling over there. Check on that. What tree is this? - Mom! - What? - What tree is that? - Huh? Adultree! - Can I get mineral water here? - Ask her to head to the street corner! She'll find the cows there. Ask her to drink cow urine! - What are they saying, sister? - I just can't take it. Her attitude is like she descended from the sky! She used to roam around with me collecting marbles! Doesn't she know this is a tamarind tree? And this dimwit keeps answering to all her useless questions! Even when she arrived... and he asked her "Are you Sengu's aunt?" She replied saying "Not that I know of but villagers say so" She acts like some rare show piece from the market! Back then she couldn't afford a onetime meal, Excuse me! I've be patient but you're crossing your limits. Mind your tone or else I'll pull out your sound plug! - So keep quiet! - First pull out your sister's sound plug! - She's crossing the limit! - She's crossing the limit? She is stating the facts. - Isn't your mom a native of this village? - Of course, she is but later she... Do you know what all she has achieved later? Do you know about my mommy? What is she saying, buddy? She is singing praises of her mother...in English! That was earlier. Now she was calling you names. - How dare you... - Buddy... Get back at her but do it in English or else she'll judge you. I... kill... you... Not happening. How did you call me names the other day then? Repeat that. I was high on toddy back then. I can't talk English without getting high. Just wait and watch, I'll make you talk in English. Attaboy! Watch me speak in English now! If "it" becomes "but" then what does "what" say? If "it" becomes "but" then what does "what" say? That's not English at all. - Come on, mommy. - Where are you both off to? Didn't your English teacher teach you this? Wait, where are you off to? - That's an invalid question! - Then answer... I can't. No, you can't escape saying that! - You agreed to the bet. - I can't tell the answer! - Give us the answer! - Ask them to stop first! Guys, stop. Let's see what she's got to tell. Catch her! Run! Stop, don't run! Pangali! They came this way. Where did they go? Nobody's to be seen. Where is he hiding with her? - Who are you talking about? - That boy. Sengu. Do you think my pangali is a pervert? Time is not on your side. Wait and watch, you'll meet your end soon. - Somebody might come. - I don't care. - Somebody might see us. - I don't care. I waited five years for this moment. Guess what, after that issue my mom never let me go out anywhere. Even to come here, I had to beg and get her permission. You put this necklace around my neck, told me that I'm your wife and left. You have no idea how much I suffered without seeing or meeting you. Don't we talk over video calls quite often? Is that enough? How about this? I too yearn for all this. If you had, we'd have eloped and got married! Fool! To take you away from your parents and marrying you is a quite easy for me. I am patient just because of what Bose ayya told me. Also, it's fair on your parent's part that they want you to marry a rich guy. So? So, in six months I'm headed to Dubai. I'll earn millions and throw that money at your father. Then I'll demand him to marry you off to me and take you away with me. - Then? - Then I'll tie the knot with you, then canoodle everyday and lead a happy life. Canoodle? Canoodling means... Pangali! - Pangali! - Uh-oh! Sounds like it's Madhi. - You leave now. - Isn't he your friend? - What's the problem if he finds out? - He'll head straight to your parents... fight them for not allowing you to marry me and he will get us married! - Sounds awesome! - That's wrong. I will tie the knot with you only after I achieve what I said. That's the right and fair way. So, you were talking about canoodling. Do it and I shall leave. It cannot be done in a hurry. Or else I won't leave. Okay? Pangali! Where did he go? Did my pangali show pity and forgive you? - His tricks won't work with me! - Pangali! Sengu is going to apply ash on her face... then she'll retaliate and the issue is going to blow up today! Is that all he chased her for; to apply a little ash? They also made us run all the way! "Come and bless us, O Lord Vinayaga, son of the one who possesses the third eye" Pangali, your phone's ringing. "The elder brother of Lord Kandan, O Vinayaga please bless us" Hello. Why are you crying? Did your mom scold you? Tell me why are you crying? Remember the chain locket you got me? I lost it. That's all? Don't feel bad. How can you take it so lightly? Of course. Why'd you cry like a baby for this? Didn't you tell me that it's like a nuptial thread. It's okay. We'll buy a new one. I think I lost it while you were chasing me. It'd be difficult to search for it in Karuvela forest (Prosopis juliflora forest) I want it back! Fine, we'll go to the town and make one exactly like that. - Let's go at once. Now! - Don't talk like a fool. We can't go now. - Now, hang up. - Hello! Hello! - What is this? - The raw materials. Our MLA is throwing a feast tomorrow, right? - What is this? - Gifts to be distributed during feast. Why is there the party symbol on the gift? People should know right, who gifted them this. - Does Bose ayya know about it? - Of course, he does. Let me ask him. Told you! Ayya, over here. Sengu! - Stop it! - Ayya... Look here... you're not allowed to throw a feast tomorrow. Leave this place in blink of an eye. - Get lost! - Ayya... Ayya... Ayya, it was an honest mistake by my party men. Please give us the permission, Ayya. - Greetings, boss. - Greetings. You came all the way to the village border to welcome me? - We can't conduct the function, boss. - Why? They saw the party symbol on the gift and made an issue out of it. You can't even handle those few kids, isn't it? Wonder how you'll succeed in politics! You said you'll put him in his place after winning elections? I'm planning to do politics using you but looks you're doing politics using me. Greetings. Is this how you welcome your guests who come for your village festival? We are know for giving a grand red carpet welcome to our guests. We don't let in anyone in our village, who plays politics for money. - I'm here as a guest. - I don't think so. Your party uniform and party flag on the car doesn't say so. If my party uniform is your problem then... Get me a new dhothi. Will you allow me now? Please come. For accepting our invitation and gracing this occasion, I thank our Rural Development minister, Mr. Rasakannu. On behalf of our village, I extend a warm welcome to him. For making me the MLA of this region, as a token of appreciation... a grand feast has been arranged here. We kindly request all the villagers to take part in it and relish the feast. Also, we are giving away a special gift for people taking part in this feast. Man, why is nobody is here? Double it. Here's an important update. We were planning to pay 5000 rupees to each villager taking part in this event, but our minister has now doubled it to 10,000 rupees. Please step forward, dear people. Please step forward. Please step forward, collect the money and make this event a grand success. We kindly request you all this. - Where are you taking him? - For the feast... You better go back! Fine. Come, let's go back. Another important update for the villagers. The minister has ordered the prize to be increased to 15,000 rupees. So come fast, have the feast and claim your 15,000 rupees, dear people. We kindly request you all this. People, please step forward. Boss, here they come. Please come. Please. Have the feast and take the money. What are you waiting for? Look, the Mulakattu festival is about to begin. Everybody is here to offer their prayers to the God and not for the money. We have a rule that outsiders aren't allowed here after 6 pm. So, see you. You have taught and trained the villagers well. They refused money because they know then they can't confront you later. They don't have to know this from me. See you then. - Sir, what is the issue? - Why are you leaving? Sir, what is the issue? Why are you getting upset and leaving? Sir, what's the big deal in letting them in here for a whole day? If we allow them for even an hour, they will split this village. This is not happening since recent times... but for generations we are following what our ancestors taught us. Why is the minister calling at this hour? Yes, boss? Do one thing, take our men at dawn and... - hoist our party flag in the village! - Boss, please be a little patient. Be patient? You swine! - Follow my orders! - Please do not underestimate him. If we lay hands on him and whole village will retaliate. Shut up! First, you resign your position. I'll make someone else the new MLA! I'll turn you into a dummy! Boss, please don't say that. I haven't even settle the debt I borrowed during last elections. Please wait for two months, boss. I'll ensure that you will walk in there and hoist our party flag yourself. You gave the same promise during last election! Boss, I am at your behest. Only you can help me succeed. - Please show sympathy on me. - Get up! I won't get up until you say you forgive me. Fine, get up. I don't know how to make you understand. Like Methane and Carbon extraction... the researchers have found a unique mineral in Ramanathapuram. This scheme has to be implemented. The higher officials have promised the corporates that it'll be implemented. If we make it happen, then we will be millionaires. Not just that, we will also get a seats for next elections. Before that the corporate people will come to inspect our land. When they step into the village... our party flag and symbol must be seen all over! - Okay, boss. - Other regions are in our control. The 16 villages under Bose's control is the only issue. True, boss. That's why I took you in my party because you are one of his native. - Understood? - I do, boss. What did you understand? Tell me. Tell me what I should do? I shall do it. First create a rift between the villagers. Divide the village into two. Do that and tell me. Then I shall tell you what to do next. He asked me split the village into two, as if it's a walk in the park. Until Bose and Chitravelan are there, that's impossible. With the right moves, it can be done. My foot! It's easy to say. Oh, come on. Don't say so. If I snuff in some powder and put my heart and soul into any plan... I'm sure I can kick start a world war. It's easier said than done! How can you create a rift between those two oldies? Forget the oldies and focus on the youngsters. Like how all the oldies in Melatheru obeys Bose... similarly all the youngsters obey Sengu there. Keezhatheru youngsters will obey Madhi's words. If we instigate a fight between Sengu and Madhi, the whole village be torn into two. It's sounds good to the ear... but they are like two bodies emerging from a single ass! How will you split them? Just wait and watch how I do it. Fine, if you succeed in doing that... I'll talk to the minister and get you a posting in the party. Why are you so quiet? I am just admiring you. I am the same guy you saw five years go, with the same beard and moustache. No, you were not the same five years ago. Is it? The girl looks very beautiful. She'd be a great match for your brother. What if she is like her mother? She doesn't seem to be like her mother. The suitor may now come and put garland on her. - Give me the garland, uncle. - Give me the kid. Take care of my kid, uncle. Stop! Who is he to do the customs? Brother, you go and do it. It's our decision to choose the suitor for our daughter. - You go ahead. - Stop! She might be your daughter but according to our tradition we have complete rights. - You go ahead and you stop! - She thinks she has the rights? I'll break your arms! [Indistinct chatter] You heard my sister! Can't you understand? [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] Move! Move away from her! What do you think you're doing? Now marry her off to your brother! Go! Come with me! Oh no! Sister. [Indistinct chatter] Why are you doing like this? It was my anger towards your mom that made me do that. I didn't even know if you liked me. It was Bose ayya who made me realize that it was a huge mistake I committed. I regret doing it because I'm sure it would have been traumatizing for you. "You kissed me in front of so many" "And now this girl has come of age and blossomed" "As the cattle moo and amidst all the noises around me" "The sound of your kiss is all I hear inside me" "I am all smiles throughout the day. I am enjoying every little thing" "I am drenched in a stream of happiness " "It's like I am born again. I'm on bed but I feel like I'm flying" "I am going crazy looking at myself in the mirror" You just kissed me and left, on that day. Who will marry me now? You got no other choice but to marry me. Come on. "After I kissed you, O dear" "Ever since I have been going crazy about you" "I don't know what is happening to me. My heart is raising" "Its been five years and I can't wait anymore" "What did you do to me? I can feel a rush of emotions in me and yet I'm surviving" "Your love is fire and I am melting down in it" "Feels like I was locked up but now a door has opened into a new world" "Show me the way to your heart, so that I can find what I lost there" "She is caught me in the net of love" "She is driving me crazy" "You kissed me in front of so many" This chain is like a nuptial thread. "And now this girl has come of age and blossomed" A heart shaped dollar. S stands for Senguttuvan. I stands for Indira. Game over! We are late. My mom's going to kill me. Don't worry, nobody can separate us. Be strong. God! My mother! I am dead. Don't panic. Tell them "I got in to a wrong bus and got down mid way" "Saw Sengu on the way and so I asked a lift" Say that, okay? Sister... - Please, let me explain. - Get lost! - Sister, please let me explain. - Don't near me! Get lost! Mind your business, don't come to me! - Sister, let me explain. Please. - Mommy... mommy! - First hear me out, sister. - Get lost! - Sister... - Don't talk to me. I was minding my own business. An old man said there said "A young girl is left stranded on the road. Help her" Mommy, I got into the wrong bus and had to get down mid way. I was looking for a lift and he was passing by. He offered to help. How can I refuse? He offered but why did you agree? You should have told him to get lost! For a silly issue she fought, cut ties with us and acts as if she's a foreigner! If she has so much attitude, shouldn't you also have some? You shameless! It's not like that I don't have any. After that incident at their house, do you think I'll go after her? If you've so much concern... you should've known that it would piss me off if you gave her a lift! So you should have at least called me and asked! I tried reaching uncle but his mobile was switched off. Yes dear, my phone keep dying every not and then. I am not ready to trust you. She's a fraud! - You wretch! - Please... Listen to me... I'm ashamed and there is no point in me living anymore! Sister, you're saying so for this silly thing? - Please let me explain. - Get lost! - Dear, wait. Where are you off to? - Dear, stop. I said, stop. - Sister... sister... - Get lost. Don't come here henceforth. Please trust me. Will you let me explain or not? - Indira, open the door. Listen to me. - Indira, open the door. - Please open the door. - I'll explain your mom. Now open. I considered you like a son and not brother. You've put my name to shame! Now that woman will look down at me with a cheap attitude. Open the door! Please! - I'm going to set myself ablaze. - Please don't, sister. Please! If something happens to you then I'll also die, sister. Indira, will you open the door or not? I promise that I never near her hereafter. Indira, if something happens to you, then I'll kill myself. Open the door, dear. Indira! Kaaliyamma! Don't hurry. Your child will get orphaned. Please come out side. Sister, what is all this? Why don't you trust me even after I explained it all? I didn't change my mind because of what you promised me. I changed my mind because else my child will become an orphan. If this happens one more time... I won't change my mind for anyone. - Sister... - Get lost. My pangali (partner) is your issue, right? You don't talk to him. He'll also not talk to you and I assure you that. If you need any help when you're here, ask me. I shall help you. Okay? Please stay until the festival is over. - Agree to it, dear. - Please agree. Why did you have to do all that, dear nephew? Will you take her around? Won't people mistake if they see you both together? What will people mistake it for? I don't care about it. What about Sengu? Won't he mistake you? Why would he mistake me? He clearly said he has no ties with them. Still, he's is her suitor and they are relative. What if some family thing comes up in future? If anybody has a problem, I shall handle it. His dance tells me he's in quite a mood. Did he plan and successfully finish off any of his foe? He promised me a posting in his party. Ask him what's the status? I promised that only if you create a rift between Sengu and Madhi. That will happen soon. Make arrangements for my posting. But how? I can't tell you that but it's going to happen soon. The moment I see both of them indulge in a fist fight, you'll get your posting. - Hello. - Hello, this is Indira speaking. - Tell me. - I want to go till Ramnadu. Are you free to take me there? I'll be there in five minutes. Dear nephew. Dear, wait I am coming with you. - Do you know where I'm headed? - Where to? To the town, right? I'll get down there. - I've one more person joining me. - All three of us will go. - I shall adjust. - It's her. Whom? God! Pangali's aunt's daughter. Oh, I see. You mean Indira? You don't have to worry she being your pangali's aunt's daughter. Uncle, she wanted to go the town. I'm dropping her. That's all. Well, I'm mean the same thing, dear. Even if there's something going on between you both... then I, your uncle, would be the first person to be happy about it. Uncle, stop cooking up such stories and gossiping. Whole village's gossiping, shouldn't I? After all I'm your maternal uncle. - What are the villagers gossiping? - I'll tell you. They say that you and that girl look like a perfect couple. A beautiful girl like here didn't fall for that cheap fellow, and instead she fell for you and people are happy about it. Who's that honking at my doorstep? Do you live alone? No, I've a lion-like tiger brother living with me. So did you neuter the lion-like tiger? Mind you! I'll break your jaws if you talk too much! - My brother would've finished you off. - Ask him to come out! He won't step out to meet women like you. Are you scared he'd fall for me? As if you're Aishwarya Rai! Who would fall for you? I'll find him a bride from America. An African bride would suit his colour better. Whomever but definitely he's not for you! As if I'm waiting for that cheap fellow. Why are you here? I showed sympathy and gave a lift. For that you're mom abused me! First, leave from here. Pangali (partner), why bring her here? - Well, we were passing by. - You call him your friend? He's roaming around with our foe! - And you call him pangali? - Sister, they are our guest. If she's your guest, take her to your home. Why bring her here? Leave at once! You heard her. Leave! Let me see for how long this will go on, mama (suitor). We have no ties with your family! Stop addressing him as your mama! I wasn't talking to your brother. I was talking to Madhi mama. Awesome, nephew! She addressed you as her mama in front of everyone! What else do can you ask for, dear? That girl has a soft corner for you, dear. Wait and watch, she will confess her love for you before leaving the village. "O Mayamma..." "O Mayamma..." "While death hangs above me" "Why do you spread me a flower bed?" "O Mayamma..." "While the fire destroys my path" "O Mayamma..." "My life wanes away slowly" "O Mayamma..." "O Mayamma..." "You are the mighty Maayamma You are my almighty Maayamma" "You are the mighty Maayamma You are my almighty Maayamma" "At the foot of the venomous serpent, my love dangles secretly" "This is a forest filled with vultures. Will you ever save my love?" "At the foot of the venomous serpent, my love dangles secretly" "This is a forest filled with vultures. Will you ever save my love?" "You are the mighty Maayamma You are my almighty Maayamma" "You are the mighty Maayamma You are my almighty Maayamma" Mama! Mama! Mama, please wait. Listen to me. - Why haven't you played the song yet? - No power supply yet. "While death hangs above me" "Why do you spread me a flower bed?" "While the fire destroys my path" "My life wanes away slowly" Uncle, attend this call. Hello? Madhi? This is Indira speaking. Sorry. I know you'd be furious. I am very, very sorry. I know there's nothing between us and I did all that to make Sengu mama jealous. When a girl insults a boy in front of so many people, obviously you will get angry and I very well know that. But I didn't know how else to act at that moment. After all this has happened, I must tell you the truth. Sengu mama and I are in a relationship for the past five years. Nobody knows about it and he wanted it to keep this secret from you too. It'd be wrong if I don't tell you now, after so much has happened. Why are you quiet? Hello? Hello? Hello? I'll talk to you later. "Whatever unfolds in front of you is never true" - What did she say? - What else? - She was apologizing. - For what? For what? You bought her bangles and that she was rude to reject it. Why apologize for that? She doesn't like me, hence she rejected it. If she doesn't like you then why'd she call and apologize? - Come on. - Then? - She said Sengu saw you both. - So what if he saw us? He hates her to the core. Come on, no matter what, he's still her suitor. He can't tolerate if anyone else romances her. You are from Keezhatheru, do you think he'll give her up so easy? I don't believe your words. - Come inside and sleep. - It's okay. Somebody might steal our cattle. I'll keep an eye on them. - What happened? - Nothing. I thought I saw some strange insect. Dear nephew, where are you headed all by yourself? What now? I know you'd want strong proof to believe anything I say. After all you're a cop. Which is why I'm here with a proof. Like Goddess Seeta's gift to Lord Raman, she sent you this gift. And I am the messenger Hanuman who brought it. - What's this? - S... I... SI. Aren't you a Sub Inspector? That's why SI. She wants you to wear this when you wear the police uniform for the first time. She asked me to hand it over to you. I am not ready to hear any explanation from you. - Please let me explain, mama (suitor). - To hell with you and your mama! You got a new fellow, right? Address him as your mama. - Listen to me, mama... - Shut up! Aren't you ashamed? You roam around with him and address me as mama? You better leave. - Or else I'll call my sister. - Go ahead, call her! - I'm not afraid. In fact I'll call her. - Quiet. If you don't leave now... I'll abuse you! Here, wipe your tears. Are you playing a prank on me? Of course, my dear aunt's daughter. Who else can would play pranks on you, if not me? Aunt's daughter? A while ago you spoke to me as if I was a stranger. Didn't you try to make me jealous? Tit for tat. Then why did you get furious at the sight of Madhi and I? You both were toiling hard to piss me off... and so I reciprocated by faking, as if I got furious. Didn't it piss you off when he tried those bangles on me? Even I don't understand why. I did get pissed off a little bit... but then I felt it was funny. You doofus! Without knowing this I told Madhi about our relationship. Oh my God! You fool! One important thing, dear. She said Sengu must not know about you both. Why? What's the issue if he comes to know? Look, at the end of the day we are from Keezhatheru. Do you think he'll allow you to marry Indira? My pangali is not such a guy. God! Looks like they found out the truth. She is here with Sengu. It's over! They both are going to kill us. Come, let's escape. What's all this? Is this what I get to for trusting you? I didn't expect this from you. I heard you also knew it all along. Are you behind all this? Forgive me, pangali. Pangali... - Pangali, aren't you upset with me? - Why would I be? - So you didn't mistake me? - Not at all I thought you'd have mistaken me. Told you, my pangali is not such a guy. - So you agree to this, pangali? - Of course or else why'd I come to you? This is enough! We'll fix this tomorrow. Remember I told you? If my pangali finds out, he'll take action at once. Pangali, there is a small issue though. Let the festival get over. We'll inform Bose ayya and then conduct the wedding. By the we'll also settle down with our jobs. Okay? God! Things seems to have gone awry. Why are you scared? Until one of them lands a job... especially Madhi won't talk about this to anyone. He will also not deny to anything Sengu tells him. The festival will get over tomorrow and that girl will go back to city. We still have a lot of time with us. "The dark and beautiful birdie. A birdie perfect for romance" Their romance will reveal the truth right away I guess. Let's escape before we get chased and busted. Let catch a bus and escape to Rameswaram at once. We'll call and find out how the situation unfolds here. Then we'll return after six months or a year. By then all the anger on us would've subsided. Stop being a chicken. Let the festival get over, first. You speak as if the festival gets over in a week. It'll be over in half an hour. Wait, you're in for a good thrashing. Mr. Kamaraj, you handle things over there. Okay, ayya. Shut up! You instigated an innocent fellow and now he's crazily in love with her. If he finds out she is not in love with him, then your game is over. Then you won't lose your other hand but you'll lose your head! Hey Indira. Hey, girl! Indira! Come here, girl. I'll wait by the temple. Come fast. Wait, I'll sow this and come. What is it? I was minding my business but you tempted me. I want a kiss right now! 'Intermission' It's over. Madhi is calling. Guess he found out the truth. He might want to kill us. Don't attend. Let's abscond. Listen to me. Don't attend the call. Yes, dear nephew. Where are you, uncle? I am by the embankment. - I must meet you. Stay right there. - Dear, I... I'll come... - Dear? - Indira betrayed me, uncle! Slow. Go easy. This is why I told you, let him not find out. Why blame Sengu for what she did? Stop taking Sengu's side! My pangali (partner) wouldn't have done it. She must have lured him! That... You think she can manipulate him? Fine, let's say she's a... but he could've confronted her, right? He could've asked 'You're in love with my friend then why are you romancing me?' Its so disgusting, dear. He was already upset that she was roaming with him. Of course, he didn't expect that she'd fall for my nephew. My nephew is a cop and she fell for it and his machoism. He couldn't digest that. 'How long will their love last? She'll anyway leave the village after festival' He must have thought so and decided to break them up before she left. Traitor! Don't judge my pangali. He is a genuine guy. What else do you expect from me? If he was that genuine, he could've spoke to her mother about you and her, on that very day. Why did he want to wait till the festival is over and talk to Bose ayya? Why does Bose ayya has a say in this? It must purely be her mother's decision. Guess Bose ayya would've his own doubts and need time. Doesn't he say that Melatheru and Keezhatheru people are equal? Then why would he have doubts? After all it's a wedding. They would think twice. If all people are equal then why'd he have doubts? He's the most sensible and genuine man in the village. If he won't agree to it... then how'd Sengu, who is his trustworthy, will accept it? They will never agree. All their equality statement just remain words... but they will never have any alliances with us. Having an alliance with us will make us equals to them... and they won't let it happen. Their intention is that we must be at their feet, cleaning it forever. Unaware of all this, your father celebrates them and treats them like God. We can never stand up to people like Bose, all by ourselves. We need a strong back up and that's why I roam around with that MLA. We must rule this village, dear. That girl was sincerely in love with you, dear. It was Sengu who manipulated her. He is a traitor. What happened? Melatheru men slashed Keezhatheru Oorpal's son. Heard that? What are you wondering? Just have it. I should have slit his throat for the way he spoke yesterday. Dare you talk like that in front of Bose ayya. It rained yesterday night... and so Oorpal's son and his friend dug a trench and used up the water. He confronted them asking "How dare you break the village rules?" They abused him and said 'We will break the rules. Do what you can' Does that give him the permission to slash him with a machete? What about his actions? Why did you do that? This year Keezhatheru people will get irrigation only after Melatheru people. By the time we get it, pond will go dry. The yields will go waste and we'll fall into debt. We will suffer loss and can't repay debts. Hence I told them to do it. Last year you got to use the irrigation first. We take alternate turns every year on who gets the water first. You keep quiet. Let us voice out our opinion. Last year only half of Keezhatheru people got irrigation because of less rain. Nobody can be held responsible for less rains last year. Only half of you didn't get irrigation last year... but nobody in Melatheru got irrigation and all our crops went bad. Our tractors were confiscated as we couldn't repay our loans. But you all are rich. You can somehow afford to pay your debt and succeed. We are struggling. Can't you give up? You are asking help. So don't demand it! At the same time we won't even fall at your feet and plead. This year, let us use the irrigation first then Melatheru may use it. Or let's face off and see who get to make the best use of irrigation. Stop it! Quiet! To hell with your father! He keeps playing spoilsport every time. Step in the pond and I'll break your legs. Hey, hold on. Wait. I'll finish you off. I said, keep quiet. - Look here... - Lets split the pond amongst us. Let's irrigate using either side of the banks. No way! Impossible. Our village is the mother of all the 36 villages around us. - They look up to us. - Ayya... - if they want to split it, let's do it. - No way. Not a chance. I know who's instigating them. Nobody's instigating us. We are voicing our own opinion. Let's split the pond. Are you intimidated that we'll out grow and be more successful than you? It's not that, buddy. All these years, they got benefited from our struggles... but if we split it, they will be forced to work. What makes you feel that they live off your hard work? You disloyal mongrels! - Velu, wait. - Please be quiet. Let me talk, only then they will know the truth. You ancestors rescued from slavery and brought here from clutches of the whites. They were given job with wages, place to stay and food. They were given lands to do farming, and later the land itself. Their next generation were educated and today you all are treated as equals. Guess who did all this? It was his ancestors. Is this how you show your gratitude? How long will you keep telling the same story? They didn't give our ancestors a job here for nothing. They brought them here because they needed people to do farming in their land. Our people toiled hard hence we are in this position today. I see. Toiled hard? If you think you can swim the ocean just because you know swimming... you'll never find shore until your last breath. Someone has to help you to the shore. That was what his family did for us and you are talking back to him? Look here, he's the king of this village. If you can obey him, then live here else leave. Get lost! Instead of finding out the problem creator... the best thing to do is focus on how to solve the problem. So going by that, the problem that's in our hand is... water. The problem that's making us fight is water scarcity. Solve it and nobody can create a rift between us. I shall put my life on the line and solve this issue. If you all trust me, then take my word and please leave quietly. Thanks a lot. Don't you ever bow to me. Look Velu, you are my friend. Until we both are alive, nobody can split up our village. Well, those men are good at heart. It was the MLA who made them speak like that. Pangali! Hey pangali! It's me. Wait, I am coming. Pangali, where were you? I've been looking for you since last evening. Your phone is not reachable. Where were... Are you drunk? Is this your doing? Bose ayya will be disappointed if he finds out. There was a huge issue in the village. It blew up and the dispute just got over. Oorpal's son is talking too much. Do warn him. Nobody should stand up to you guys. Immediately you'll want them to be warned! What was wrong with his argument? Exactly, what was wrong with his argument? Pangali, come on. Don't you talk like that. Come here, I want to have a word with you. Whatever it is, say it right here. I want to say it in secret. Just come with me. You heard him. Whatever it is, say it right here. Say it or shut up and leave! Fine, you leave. We'll talk later. That was awesome, dear nephew! 'IAS Officer's office' So you want another irrigation tank in your village? There are two tanks in your village. Are they filled up by rains? No, they haven't filled up. If we build another tank, we can save the wasted water. That will put an end to water scarcity. That is why government brought the '100 days job' scheme to clean water tanks. Sir.. don't you know how that's going? It's your people who are employed to do that work. Can't you make them work? We can but that won't suffice. We need one more tank. Only then water scarcity will come to an end. We need it as soon as possible, sir. It can't be done immediately. There's no fund and on top, it's election time. Sir... you guys will spend in millions to advertise yourself. We don't have water to drink and you tell us you don't have funds? I am helpless. So you are also a puppet of the politicians? We heard people talk good about you. We trusted that and came to you. Let's leave. No use talking to him. What are you going to do next? We shall build the tank on our own, sir. Good! Very good! That's how you must take everything in a sportive spirit. But no matter how much you save, that bloody rascal will suck it all up. He means the distilleries. Our first job is to chase away the distilleries from our village. The bloody rascal I'm talking about are not them. Then who? Who is he? - I shall wait outside. - No, wait. It's okay. You seniors discuss. I shall wait outside. Tell us, what is the matter? - Hello. - Mama, where are you? At IAS office, came with Bose ayya. - I am also at IAS office. - Here but why? - Obviously to meet you. - Where are you? I am.. - near the tea shop. - Tea shop? - Bose ayya's vehicle is parked near it. - Mama! - What is it? - Need to replace the garbage cover. How many times have I told you to knock before coming in. Fine, do it. Seemai Karuvela tree (Prosopis juliflora) is the bloody rascal I was talking about. Sir, I was worried you'd say something else. You're educated and yet you are showing that tree as a reason? What do you know about Seemai Karuvela tree? What's so funny? A tree that was banned in Australia. All those disposed seed from there... has grown here into Seemai Karuvela forests. It's root grow so deep under earth and suck all the water. It won't let any other plants or trees grow in its surroundings. So if we eradicate all these Karuvela tree, then it'll solve our water problem? Definitely. You can't destroy it so easily and they won't let you destroy it. Are you talking about charcoal businessmen? I am not talking just about them. Many corporate company owners... use this charcoal from Karuvela tree in their industries, as fuel. Soon, the whole district of Ramanathapuram... is going to turn in to Karuvela charcoal forest for these corporate owners. Sir but the government is motivating everyone to cut it down. Well, it will grow back even stronger after six months when it's cut down. Probably that's why. What? I said 'See you'. What happened? Don't call yourself my maman (suitor) Why do you say so? I'm telling you that I'm leaving to city and you're saying 'see you' To hell with you. Didn't you tell me that your dad wants you back there at once? Like the Hydrocarbon extraction in Pudukkottai, Neutrino extraction in Theni and Methane extraction in Thanjavur... they have discovered some unique mineral in our district. They have sold the district to corporate owners to dig it out and do business. Soon you'll have to vacate your village and move to town. How can we vacate the land where we have been doing agriculture for generations? How can we vacate? Since they know you'll revolt asking such questions... they won't let you cut down Karuvela tree which will result in water scarcity... and that's how they drive all the villagers away to town. Most of the villages here only have empty houses. Such villages have been named as 'Petchilla gramam' (Silent villages) Pathetic! They are doing business with the land that feeds them! Cunning fellows! This Karuvela tree is destroying the human race... and who allowed it to be planted here? Instead of doing research on that... it's better if you understand the politics behind it. To destroy agriculture and it's source villages... and drive the villagers to cities/towns is their motivation. In the end our people must beg the whites and corporate owners for survival. In short, a scheme to eradicate a whole race. This is how a whole race called Red Indians are no more in America. And we will face the same predicament soon. The politicians have got enough bribe from corporate owners to make it happen. This Karuvela tree politics is one among them. First uproot all the Karuvela trees... and stop it from growing back. Then instead of letting the land go barren, agriculture must be carried out on it on regular basis. Where will we get water to carry out agriculture on regular basis, sir? Destroy the Karuvela tree and all the trees and plants will get enough water. More trees will result in more rain and underground water level will raise. - Thank you, sir. - It'll obviously take time. First you start it in your village and other villages will follow suit. Then people who left the village will return and start doing agriculture. Ensure you keep this a secret until your mission is complete. If they find out, they will start protests and create a ruckus. It'll become an advantage for the politicians. One more thing. The politicians must never find out why you're cutting down the Karuvela tree. If they find out, they will do everything in their power to stop it. Look here, tomorrow morning we've to cut down all the Karuvela trees around the temple. Ask a man from every household to come. Tell them it's my order. You inform in Melatheru and you in Keezhatheru. Okay. You said you'll resolve the water crisis... but now you want us to cut down Karuvela tree? It is to resolve water crisis we want to cut down the Karuvela tree. Don't ask too much and bring everyone to cut it down. Now leave. Be there at early morning. Are you going somewhere far? I'm off to Ramnadu regarding my posting. Hope you'll be back by morning. I don't know. I'll know only after going there. Try to make it back soon. I have already informed the boys. You also tell them once and ask them to be there at morning. None of you must go to cut down that trees. - Won't your father confront us? - I'll handle it. Just go out somewhere. Don't be in the village. Inform all our boys. Sengu, look over there. Okay, dad. Okay. Daddy asked me to rest well and return to city once I am completely fine. Okay. Go and sleep. Hey girl! - Who is it? - It's me. Mama? - Wait right there. - What happened to you? Uncle said you're not well. Well, that... I lied so that I can stay here longer. Why are you looking at me like that? Well, you look unique in the brightness of this candle. Now look at this! There's a poet inside you too? Of course, I do know romance. Well, you're still young. I'm controlled because I don't want you to get pregnant before marriage. My foot. He doesn't even know to kiss properly. Forgot all the kisses so far? - You call that a kiss? - Wasn't it? Do you even know how to kiss? How? Show me. Tomorrow! God! If I you don't show me how to kiss now then I won't be able to sleep tonight. Can't it wait? You want to know now? - Whom are you talking to? - To God, mom. I'm praying. To God? I'm praying to God that in my next birth too I want you both as my parents. Greetings, ayya. Greetings to all. What are you all waiting for? Start cutting down the Karuvela trees. (Prosopis juliflora) They didn't allow to cut the trees Greetings. Greetings. - Greetings, ayya. - Greetings. I ordered them to cut down the trees in Karuvela forest. I hear you're not allowing it. May I know why? This is government's property. You need permission. Government's property? Which one? - Sengu, ask the boys to start cutting. - Wait. Hold on. I warn you. If you cut trees without permission, we'll have to arrest you. Who told you this is government's property? That's how it's in the records. Here, have a look. Someone has prepared a forged document. Not just this area... but surrounding 25 acres was gifted to villagers by my father, for agriculture. Due to no rains, agriculture couldn't be carried out. - And it turned into Karuvela forest. - You might be saying the truth... but now this is government's property. So, argue at the court. - Here... - Listen... They are working on his orders. Let's get on with our work. Listen to me. Ask your men to disperse. - Or else we'll have to use force. - I dare you to try that! Buddy, ask all our boys to come. Wait. Hey, hands off him! How dare you lay hands on him? He's quite on my orders or else he'll... So, sir. What do you want us to do now? Sir, I've the record that says it's government property. If you think the document is forged, then produced the original at court. That's all? Listen... This is for the crook behind all this. This is our land! The land nurtured by the blood and sweat of my ancestors. So I don't want anyone to assume that he can strike a deal and sell it. It won't happen until I am alive. Come on. Hey, the IAS officer is on the call. - Tell me, sir. Greetings. - Greetings. Looks like our conversation has reached their ears. I have been transferred. Is it? I wonder how the information leaked. No use talking that. We are out of time. You first find that original document and submit it at the court. Court will be functioning today then for two days it will be on leave. These three days are enough for them... to go to supreme court in Delhi and get a stay order. Then you can't even touch the Karuvela tree for fuel. How about we go to the registrar's office and look there? Do you think that's so easy? You know the Mariamman temple priest, right? Yes. He has told me about such incidents from his father's time. - How about we get his expertise? - Sure. The priest died just three months ago. He was a nice man. He had a friend visit him regularly from Siluvar. He used to work at Ramanathapuram. He is also no more. I hear his son lives in Paramakudi. Try inquiring him. You might find something. After the father's death, the brothers took their part of wealth and left. Rest of the document was handed over to the village head, in the palace. You might find those documents in Ramanathapuram palace. - Greetings, king. - Greetings, sir. Sengu... Sengu! Yes, sir? I think we'll get the document. They are looking for it. You do one thing. Court is quite near from here. Go and talk to our lawyer. Tell him to hold the judge. - We'll reach there by 6 pm. - Okay. - Just a minute. - Tell me. - Keys. - Okay. - Thank you, sir. - Thanks a lot. Those guys over there have been following us since morning. - Stop having such doubts all the time. - No, stop near them. Are you waiting for me? Where are you from? Ayya, we are coming from Chatrakudi. We heard you wanted to cut Karuvela trees. So we wanted to know if we start that work in our native too. You were busy since morning. So thought we'll wait here, as you'll pass by. - Okay, dear. I'll inform when to start. - Okay, ayya. Why would they follow us? 'In the accident that took place at the Paramakudi-Ramanathapuram' highway' 'Chandrabose AKA Bose and his friend Chitravelan' 'died on the spot' 'Police reached the accident spot and are investigating' 'We will have further information only after investigation' 'Signing off is Nandini along with the cameraman fro News10' "Our God is gone..." My dear, what will we all do now, without you? "Darkness has spread all over our village" "If God is no more then what good is a temple?" "Give us some answers" Whatever it is, it can wait. Please leave now. Buddy, that MLA is here. - Please leave. - Why? Our leader is not dead. He is sleeping peacefully. That's why I ordered not to even play the funeral music. Please don't create any issue. Please leave. I am the local MLA. Who are you to stop me from attending any happy or sad events here? You may go anywhere in this village... but all I'm asking you is not to visit our ayya. Why would I come to see your ayya? I am here to pay my respects to our Velu ayya. He is also like our father. I'm talking on his behalf too! He's also like your father? Are you his legitimate son? Here's his real son. If he asks me to get out, I'll leave at once. I know what my pangali (partner) has to say. Both our decision is the same. Tell on his face, pangali. Dear, this is your time to take revenge on him for all that you suffered. Don't think too much. Invite him inside. Pangali, if you have any grudge on me then show it on me. Don't let them inside. Pangali... Don't let them win, pangali. You gave him too much space considering him your best friend. He crapped right on your face! We must have kept a distance with them! You welcomed each and everyone and generously provided them with everything. You were the anchor to our ship... but where did you go leaving us stranded in the middle of the sea. Now whom do we have to guide these innocents, lost kids? O my father, whom do we look up to, without you by our side? Whom do we have, O father? "Our ayya is the king of kings. He's a braveheart respected by all" "He's a braveheart respected by all" "Our ayya is a fearless lion. He is our God" "He is our God" "He taught the bowed ones to stand for themselves and walk upright" "He carried our village in his heart and shoulder but now is asleep forever" "Here goes his funeral procession. He is on his journey to heaven" "He lived like a king. A man who touched million lives" (Lamenting) (Lamenting) "Our ayya is a braveheart. He's is epitome of honesty" "He's is epitome of honesty" "He's like the ferocious hunter. A saviour who always had our backs" "A saviour who always had our backs" "He was the guardian of our people. He'll go down as hero in our history" "He was a man of his word. Now he's on his journey to heaven" "We fall at his feet for his wisdom. Make his funeral procession a grand one" "He's the one who faced everyone face to face" "He was the epitome of friendship. He was our confidante" "There goes our God, leaving us alone" "The whole world is mourning" "How could you leave us, dear?" "The whole world is crying. God, take our lives and bring him back" "Lord of death, please return him to us" "O the one going on the charriot, who will guide and advise us now?" "My mind is going mad. My blood is boiling in rage. Come, let's go to war" "O the one who is hailed by all. O the one who has been all over" "Where are you going, leaving us stranded like this?" "Where is he going, leaving us stranded?" "We never bowed down. We never begged. Come, let's lock horns and fight" "Bring it on! Come on!" "There goes our ayya on the chariot" "Our laments can be heard all over, as we cry because he is no more" "He has fell prey to a conspiracy" "Our village was filled with fragrance but now it's filled with corpses" "Oh my God, you are leaving us all alone" Sengu, they are trying to overtake us to the graveyard. If they overtake, our ayya must then wait for his turn. We can't let that happen. Quick! Go fast! "There goes our deity. There goes our leader" "There goes our deity. There goes our leader" Fast! Fast! Run! "There goes our deity. There goes our teacher" "There goes our deity. There goes our teacher" "There goes our deity. There goes our teacher" See that? You can't enter unless we give way. Guys, look what you did! They will over take us only for funeral but will forget their ayya's face soon. We shall do something, which will never let people forget your father. Wondering what is that? We will erect a statue of your father at the entrance of the village. If you erect a statue, we'll build a temple for our ayya. You can't place a brick without government's permission. To hell with your government. If it can allow you to erect a statue won't it allow us to build a temple? Only one statue can be erected in village entrance. Then it must be our ayya's statue. You are locking horns with us on purpose for any decision we take. Who is locking horns on purpose? - They already got the permission? - When? Before his death? - You're being unfair! - Hold this. What's unfair? What's unfair? Ayya served the starving people but you want to play politics with them? Does that seem fair to you? Why are we even talking to him? Let's fight! Whoever is alive can erect their ayya's statue. We are also waiting for that! We thought "Why take the lives of those whom we gave life to" Let's see who takes whose life! - Shall we? - Come on! - Stop it! Stop it! - I'll slit all your throats! - We'll also slit your throat! - Let's see. Come on! Stop fighting! You'll fight and kill each other... finally everyone will blame me, the MLA! Forget the statue! No way! After all this, we must erect an statue of our ayya! Fine, then let's do one thing. Do as I say. You both fight... but not here. Whoever wins this kabaddi match gets to erect the statue. Main seven in! First ride - Melatheru. Kabaddi... Kabaddi... Kabaddi... Two points - Melatheru. Kabaddi... Kabaddi... Kabaddi... Let him come further in! Point to rider. Let him come further. Get him! Go! We will erect the statue of our ayya! We shall start the work tomorrow to erect ayya's statue. Until then this will act as his statue. Fall at his feet and get his blessings. O Ayya, our saviour. Our God! I will do whatever you requested for. Now, get up. - Get up. - Please, get up. It's my responsibility to erect a statue for Chitravelu. In return you must do something for me. - We'll do anything. - That's all I need. I'll do the needful tomorrow. Now, go and eat. Thank you, sir. - Get them what they want. - Go inside and eat. Go inside. I'll take care of it. Boss, the one person who helped in all of this... was that one handed fellow, Maari. - Him? - Yes, boss. Please give him some posting in our party. - Sure, we can do that. - So which posting, boss? Your MLA posting. Boss, I won't ask you anything hereafter. Leave me alone. God! He's trying to dig a grave for me! If they don't allow us to erect my dad's statue... - none of them must be alive. - We'll do that, pangali (partner). We won't give up so easy. Our ayya's statue matters the most to us. What are you doing here? I think this will blow up into a huge issue. Before it turns into a war, let's confess the truth and leave. Poor guys. Please don't sacrifice innocent lives for your selfishness. This is what I was waiting for all this while. If you screw this up in the name of confessing the truth... I'll finish you off! Keezhatheru people insulted our ayya's statue! - Kill them! - See that? That's how I do politics. How is it? Now they will forget Bose's death... and also Karuvela forest (Prosopis juliflora) issue. Now they will only have time to fight and kill each other. Let's take care of other works. Guys, Melatheru men are coming to kill us! None in Keezhatheru must be alive. Chase everyone and chop them down! Massacre everyone in Keezhatheru! Oh my God! They are butchering us! Somebody help us! Melatheru men are killing everyone at sight. Call the police. No! No! Please don't kill me! Please don't! Oh my God, fire! Save us! Somebody help us! Guys, the police is here. Escape! - Let me out! - Don't yell, dear. - Why are you screaming? - You wait here. We know what to do. Stop screaming! - Quiet now. - Sir, please let me out. My side of the village has been burnt down. Let me out! Let him out. Let him go and massacre them. But if you do that now, charges will be pressed against you. If you listen to me then it'll in turn become your duty. Aren't you waiting for your appointment order? Guess where I'll be posting you on duty? Greetings, sir. - Any update about Sengu? - We are tracking his phone number. When he gets the next call, we'll trace him down. Minister wants the party symbol inauguration to happen tomorrow. Give us full protection. Okay, sir. Superb! What are you wondering? Wondering why party symbol is here instead of your father's statue? If you make this inauguration a success... then next will be your father's statue inauguration. Minister has confirmed it. - Happy? - Yes, brother. But one thing. Sengu will do everything in his potential to ruin this party symbol inauguration. None of them should near this party symbol. That is also your responsibility. No matter who comes... Forward march! An important announcement to the people of Enathi. As law 144 is being imposed, we request all of you to stay inside your house. If anybody gets any news about Sengu and his allies... then we kindly request you to inform the police at once. Pack your dress. Get up! Get up! - Why? - We are leaving at once. I'm not coming. I'm sick. Your dad had already predicted things will go awry here and booked the tickets. Try to understand mom. I am sick. I know what drama you're playing. You better get ready and start! - I said, get up! - Listen... You start. I'll make her understand and bring her. Look at her drama! Get ready in five minutes or else mind you! You, come on now! Dear, don't cry. Hello. Yes, uncle? Hope you're doing fine. I am fine but Indira is weeping here. I'll give the phone to her. Talk to her. Here, dear. Hello. Dear... Indira... Don't cry, girl. I am fine. I want to meet you. It's impossible now, dear. We are leaving back to city. Fine, you go. I'll come and meet you in Chennai. No, I must meet you before I leave. I'll surely come. Don't cry. Meet me in person. I want a kiss. Why are you asking him to come now? The police is all over the village. Uncle, even if not for her, my plan to come there tonight is confirmed. I came to know everything. What is wrong with Madhi? Let me see how they're going to conduct the party symbol inauguration. Listen, it's me. Sengu will be caught. Ask our men to be ready. Once you hear the gun shot, barge into the village. This is our best chance to exact revenge. Don't miss it. This is Sengu's doing! Sengu! Show up if you are a real man! - He must be around. Ask them to search. - Search! Sengu! Are you trying to intimidate us with country bombs? You cannot intimidate me! Dear, you leave first. I'll bring him. Indira, if you choose him then never come back to us ever. I will cut all ties with you. Who is it? Who is that? Stop! Stop! Stop! You useless fellows! - Hit her! - God! None of the Melatheru people must be alive. Kill every last one of them! Go! Kill any Melatheru man at sight! It is all Sengu's doing. What are you all doing here? - Sir, we heard a bomb blast here. - Go and search for him! Go! Sir, save us! Save us! Stop. Stop. - Nothing will happen to you all. - You keep saying this... - but we are scared for our lives. - Law 144 is being imposed We have got shooting order. If you are out here, then all your lives are at danger. Please listen to me. Where are you all headed to? - We heard a bomb blast this side, sir. - What are you doing here? - Who's guarding the party symbol? - Nobody, sir. First, go there! Go! Come on, quick! Sir, look Sengu is on the roof top. - Hello. - What happened? Sir, the destroyed the party symbol. I don't care what you'll do. The culprit must be dead by tomorrow morning. Okay, sir. Please leave me, sir. Finish him off! Chop him down! You better leave! I am very mad at you. I'll kill anybody who comes in between. First kill me before kill my mama. Don't drive me crazy. You better leave! You already are crazy! First shoot me before shooting him down! I won't have any consideration for you. I'll shoot you down too! - So you better leave! - I said, shoot! Look here. Hear me out once. I'm in no mood to listen to you. Six of my men are dead. He is the reason behind all that. I must kill him! Move, Indira. Let him shoot me down. We don't have to plead him. Come again? That's what you think of us? You consider us so cheap? Aren't our lives worth anything? It is for my people's dignity and respect, I'm holding this gun today! I considered you my best friend and look what you did? You're after all a traitor! Whom did you call a traitor? You are the traitor! - Leave him! - I must kill him. Move! It's all because of you. Haven't you mend your ways yet? What did I do to mend my ways? What's that around your neck? This was gifted by him. It's like a nuptial thread for me. What does those initials mean? S stands for Senguttuvan. I stands for Indira. Then what about the locket you gifted me? I gifted you a locket? Pangali (partner)... I committed a grave mistake. I don't deserve to live. Is this how you make hasty decision every time? No pangali, I deserve to die. What is that grave mistake you made? How can I ever... that too the girl you are in love with? I am so disgusting! You fell for her thinking there's nothing between me and her. You call that a grave mistake? I should have come and asked straight to you but they didn't let me. In that case, I am at fault. At least I should have told you. - I was worried, you'd rush it... - No pangali. You trusted me so much. I was not true to you. I deserve to die, pangali. If that's the case, I also deserve to die. I am also at fault. No, I am the reason behind all of this. It was my selfishness. I toyed with your emotions. No, pangali. Killing ourselves is not going to bring back lost lives. Let's ensure no more lives are lost and work towards that. Maari and the MLA are the real culprits, who are behind all this. I'm sure they are behind both our ayyas death. If they are dead, all these problems will be resolved. It all started because of me. I shall take care of it. You take her and leave. If you guys stay here, your lives will be in danger. Maari and MLA, those two... Careful! Careful. Sit Maari! - Uncle, come fast. - What are you saying? - Where is he? - Here. Outside. - What happened? - He's missing, uncle. - Wait, let me go and find him. - Where are you going? - You don't go. I'll go. - Wait, let me check. Maari! Maari, where is Madhi? He found out the truth. I stabbed him. What are you looking at? Send him to his Bose ayya! I knew it! I knew you'd be behind my ayya's death. I will destroy you! But before that, tell me why did you murder my ayya? Finish him off! Stop! Tell me, why did you murder my ayya? Speak! I don't know anything. Minister asked me to do it. Corporate companies have some business plan in Ramanathapuram. Bose ayya was an hindrance to that. That's why we murdered him. Why did you come here, pangali (partner)? I told you to go to hospital. I'm fine, pangali. Don't worry about me. The police are nearing you. They will shoot you at sight. You better leave at once. Pangali, don't let him escape. Catch him! I will kill you! Go Pangali, the police is here. Save me! Save me! Save me! Save me, please! Pangali, don't let him escape. Don't shoot me! I'm the MLA. Don't shoot me. Pangali! Pangali... Sir, DSP speaking. We finished off those five guys. SI Madhimaran and MLA died in this chaos. What's the big deal? Leave that. Dispose those five corpses. 'SI and MLA got killed in the riot that sparked between two castes people' 'We had to issue shooting order to stop the riot' "Inside the Karuva (Prosopis juliflora) forest" "Oh my God! While making charcoal inside the Karuva forest" "Our own children, were devoured by death" "Were devoured by death" "Ayya!" "That man's treachery" "Their treachery" "Has snatched our children from us" "Our hearts will bleed even if a sparrow is shot down here" "Our hearts will bleed" "To slay a human being" God! My brother! "Ayya!" They killed my brother! Oh God! My brother! "If they were shot down with bullets, we can take it out" Look at my brother! "But they were killed by betrayal" "How can this be corrected?" "How can an act of betrayal be corrected?" "Ayya!" - Hello. - Calling from India Today press. We hear give innocents are being shot dead in Enathi, on ministers orders. - Is it true? - Who said so? Not at all! News has been leaked to press. Finish it off before the issue blows up. Sir, one of them is missing. That's Sengu, isn't it? - It's him! I will kill him today! - Leave it. Don't. - Let him live. - Leave me! I'll kill you! I won't spare your life! I will follow you wherever you go! Sengu, stop! He ran this way. Give me some force to catch him. No way! Public has sniffed what's happening. You go and catch him. Sister! Wait! Excuse me! Wait! Excuse me! Sengu is not dead! Yes. He is alive! It's me. Maari is coming from behind. Run! He is behind you. Run! - Did you find him or not? - No, sir. Shoot some random person and bring. Anyway we are burning of the corpses. He became a scapegoat for the greed of the politicians. No! We cannot live in unity, until people like him exist. He deserved to die. Mama! Mama! Mama! In short, a scheme to eradicate the human race. I escaped so that I can let villagers know the truth and end the feud. But the cops were everywhere. I couldn't enter the village and had to go away. Soon, the whole district of Ramanathapuram... is going to turn in to Karuvela charcoal forest for these corporate owners. We waited for the feud to end and our village to be united again. Another party won the next elections and came into ruling. It gave us a new hope. 'Get out! Get out! Don't rob us! Don't rob us!' Only later we came to know that that party was also a slave to the corporate. Go from here! Keezhatheru and Melatheru people protested against them in unity. But the politicians very well know what weapon they must use to break that unity. Guys, Melatheru people have insulted our ayya's statue! We must slit their throats! Come on! 'Media says, every year, certain crooked...' '...politicians exploit and sacrifice many young men' 'in the name of caste disputes, only to aid their political agenda.' 'We people must stay vigilant'
