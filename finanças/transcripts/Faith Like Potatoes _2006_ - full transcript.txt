Hurry up. Put it on the back. Lift the bloody thing, man. You wanna go work with the women? Yeah. The violence has continued unabated. Vigilante factions have taken law into their own hands. The government is asking for restraint. That's the end of the news headlines. Our next bulletin will be at 8 p.m. - How is he? - Oh, not good. He's not gonna make it. You sort it out. And when you've finished... ...can you park the Landie at the tree there by the house? Okay. They say that the condition for a great miracle is impossibility. But nothing on earth could help me keep my farm in Zambia. But I was left with no choice. The war, the lack of education for our children... ...and an uncertain future for white farmers... ...had left me with no option. Well, then I'd rather sell the farm. We're getting worse than the bush war in Zimbabwe. I can't believe... ...we're even considering this. We belong here. We built this place up. We'll start again together. We'll find another farm somewhere... ...where the kids can go to school from home. I'm not sending my kids to a boarding school in Zambia. The farmers in South Africa seem to be doing well. God will give us a farm. And the stuff at the bank? Yeah, well, it's as sorted as they'll ever be in Zambia. We're gonna have to smuggle in some dollars. Is that wise? Angus, is that wise? Yeah, well, we have to do it. Bloody idiot, man, look where you're going. Angus, don't. Stop it. Stupid man. Now we really have to leave Zambia, and quick. Dad, what other things can we take? Anything we can fit in. Put it in the back. We got such a bad price for the farm. But at least we've got each other and the kids. I'll make it work. I know you will. We'll miss you. Well, we can't afford a sugar-cane farm or anything fancy... ...but welcome to our new home. What are we gonna farm here? Beans and maize, cattle. And water? What about water? Where's our house? Our house has wheels on it. We're like gypsies now. Gypsies in the Garden of Eden. It's gonna stand right here. What are we gonna call our new home? "Shalom." Shalom? Why Shalom? It means "peace." Peace. No, man. Come on, man. I said the stump, not the bloody rope, man. You bloody idiot, man! Come on, man, have you got no brains? Hamba, man. Get off my farm. What have I done? You are mad. I need men with brains. With some sense in their heads. Bloody idiot. Was that necessary? He just wanted to help. I didn't like the look of him. These Zulus are devious. I don't understand what they're saying. We need the help. If the right men come along, I'll knock some sense into them. In the meantime, I'll do everything myself. I'll build this place up alone. I can do it if I have to. I don't need anybody. - Love, be sensible. - No, Jill. I'll make this work my way, like I've done before. Andy, come now. Come on, get in the car. Move back... move back... Hit! Hey, boys, hit, man! Hey, these boys... ...there we go. This is it! Thank you, girl. Hey, Isaiah... There's a new white man at the Dixon place. We must go see if he can give us some work. This is it! These boys... Hey, boys, be firm! Go down, go down! I'll get you out, you cursed stump. The kids seem to be happy in their new school. And there's a polocrosse club in the neighborhood. You should go and meet some people. - Stating that there would be suspicious characters around. In fact, these are the police that are being sent to patrol the area. Another white farmer was shot and killed at the weekend... ...near Greytown in the Natal Midlands. The farmhouse was ransacked... ...and the farmer's wife and children and two of the farmer's workers... ...were assaulted and tied up. This is the second attack on farmers... I hope we did the right thing. Maybe we should just move to town. I can sell the tractors or something. People get robbed and hijacked in towns in this country too, love. We'll pray that God protects us. You pray. Why should God listen to me? I'm asking if you have some work for me? Do you speak English? Fanagalo? No, I only speak Zulu, sir. I will do a good job. I know farm work. Well, can you drive one of those? So, what can you do, man? Hi there. I'm Koos Smit. Welcome to Greytown. Name's Buchan, Angus Buchan. Do you play? Yeah, I've played before. Well, you can practice with us, but don't get hurt. I don't want your wife on my back. We like to play rough, us policemen. And the farmers, they really give it stick. But if you wanna play, there's some gear in the clubhouse. And Jonah will sort you out with a pony. See you. Hey, boet, it's not too late to change your mind, all right? It's okay. If you don't have the guts to play with us... ...you can play bowls with the old people in town. Horses on up. Pawn. Right towards you. Come on. Go. The green mamba. Hey, Angus. You, my boet, have five seconds flat. Starting now. Five... - Five, four, three, two... - Five. - Four, three, two, one, zero. - One. Hey. Not bad for an Englishman. Hey, I'm a Scotsman. Welcome to Greytown, boet. Meet Percy Hawkins, a sugar-cane farmer. Hello, Angus. Let me give you some good advice, old boy. You're gonna need eyes in the back of your head at Dixon's old farm. You probably heard the news that our Zulus are a treacherous bunch. I'd watch my back if I were you. Hey, you've heard the news. It's a bloody war out there. Gotta have good firepower. I carry mine every day. Don't take any nonsense from these natives, old boy. You've gotta show them who's boss, simple as that. They respect that. It's bloody, absolutely bloody. That's the way it's done, though. It's no different in Zambia. What's that? No, Nkosana, you can't live in a toy house, it's not right. No, man, slower, man. Slower. I know very little Zulu. Don't speak too fast. I can show you how to build a house. The little tin house on wheels... ...it's not good for your family. I think he wants us to build a house. He's madder than I thought. Greetings, brother Greetings. Hi. I'm Steyn. You must be Angus and Jill. Hi. Ja, we heard you guys moved in. I'm the farm manager just here across the river. It's good to meet you, Steyn. Do you speak Zulu? I only know a few words. Ja, I can speak Zulu. I think he wants us to build a house, but... Can you tell him that we've gotta do other work today? When I've got money after the first crop... ...then I'll get a proper builder to do it. Nkosana thinks that it will take... ...a long time... to build a house. He says... he'll get a builder to do it. No, no, tell him not to worry. I'm a strong man. I've got other strong men and women who can help us. We'll build a beautiful house in a few weeks. Angus, you know, these guys, I've seen them. They build their own huts within a week. They use natural materials. They're very skilled at this. He says that if you help him... ...he could build you a nice place within three weeks. Okay. Tell him I'll think about it tonight. But today we're gonna clear more wattle to make room for planting. Come, Steyn, come join us for some coffee. There you go. This is my old friend Isaiah. He's come here to help me. He also wants to work here with us on the farm. Good day, Nkosana. Let me help you, Nkosana. Simeon says there is much to do on the farm. Do you drive a tractor? Yes, Nkosana, I can drive a tractor. Okay, come and help me inside. Since when can you drive a tractor? He's a crazy white man. He behaves like one of those mad Italians working on the power lines. He waves his hands about all the time, speaking nonsense. You know what I've done? I've named him Nkosaan Italiaan! Today we're gonna finish this. And tomorrow, we'll try and get a contract for seed maize... ...for cattle, and we can start... Angus, take a break. Love, we've done so much already. We've found water, we've found land. We've built, or nearly built a house. Just take a break. What do you think you're doing? Well, you lot, welcome to the Buchan mansion. My beautiful little nephew. Joanne, it's great to have you and Fergus here. It's really good for Angus to have his brother around, really. And apart from polocrosse, he just works. The farm attacks don't help either. And you know what he's like when his blood's up. Ladies, the water's ready. He needs help, Joanne. He needs help. He's strung out like a tight guitar string all the time. And I'm just waiting for the snap. All I can do is love him. A friend of Fergus' was in the same way... ...and the doctor put him on some tranquilizers. It has helped. The pills detach you from your problems. Maybe Angus need a little help for a while... ...just to get him through. Why don't you plant potatoes? They say there's good money in it. Hey, man, planting potatoes is a very expensive exercise. Aside from getting the seed potatoes, you need a ton of fertilizer per hectare. With mealies, you put down less than half as much. What, three, 400 kilos, eh? It's something like that, but that's not what bothers me... ...it's the water and the spray program. It's expensive, and we don't have the water. What for, blight? Exactly, man. - The spray is about 6000 rand. - Ja, something like that, 6000. Let me get that for you, Jilly. Nobody plants potatoes here unless they've got a lot of water. If you don't get enough rain, you can kiss your farm goodbye. - Thanks. - Who wanted the coffee? Right here, Jilly. Chickens, broiler chickens. Now that's the future. Ja, people love chicken. Alistair, look here. Alistair. Ja, that's right. That's it. That's it. Auntie Angus, please can you come and play? We'll play later, okay? I'm just having some coffee now. Alistair calls me Auntie Angus. Hey. What's wrong? What's wrong? There's a big problem. What big problem? Speak up, Bhengu! There's a big accident. Well, show me. What the heck happened here? No. No, no, no, man! What happened here? What have you done, man? Nkosana, I let... Simeon drive... No, no... you're not putting it right! I expressly said you don't drive this tractor. How many times must I tell you? I let you drive... How am I supposed to farm with this? You're supposed to be my induna. You'd better run. I'm gonna kill you. Never come back! Come back! It's fine. Come back. I'll think of something. We'll fix this. How am I supposed to farm with this? Bloody idiots. I'm gonna kill you. You're gonna have to help me every night. After work. I don't have money for a mechanic. We're gonna do this ourselves. You are gonna have to help me fix what you've broken. For no extra pay. Do you understand? It's right, Nkosana. We will do that. You're right. Shoot, man. Sorry, Koos. I'm falling apart. What you need, boet, is a shot of whiskey... ...a Benzol and your bed. Oh, Koos, it's hectic. I've never been like this before. I work every day... ...18 hours a day on most days. I'm stressed. I... I feel ready for the funny farm. I make those pit bosses on the farm work just as hard as I do. You know what amazes me? They keep up to my pace. My induna, Simeon... ...what a beauty. That's one tough Zulu there. When last did you have a holiday? What's that? Jill's even got me some tranquilizers. And are you gonna take them? I don't know, man. Those things are for fruitcakes. I'm a pussycat. But I'm not a bloody fruitcake. Well, if it isn't Mandela's little policeman... ...and the manic Zambian in a conversation about psychiatry. Is your John Deere fixed yet, Buchy? Get lost, Percy. I would've beaten the life out of those idiots, and fired them. They won't respect you now. Bull, Percy. Keeping the peace is the best security for our farmers. I mean, you know what happened to Engelbrecht a couple of months ago. The man had two kids with a Zulu worker. Wouldn't have anything to do with them. And on top of that, he refused to pay lobola. Let me tell you something, Percy. If there's one nation that knows how to retaliate... ...it's the Zulus. These guys have been fighting blood feuds for generations. And if they can kill each other today... ...for cattle that was supposedly stolen over a hundred years ago... ...what chance do you have? No, boet. Respect the law, but above all, respect the people. And I thought you Afrikaner cops knew better than that. Let me tell you something, Koos, and you'd better listen carefully. The most dangerous job in the world is being a farmer in South Africa. You know, I read in the Farmer's Weekly... ...that more than 1600 farmers have been murdered... ...in 8000 farm attacks. One thousand, six hundred. And some of those were my friends. So that is what your so-called freedom brings. Those were my favorite pants, you twit. So if that is what your so-called freedom brings... ...you'd better recognize the place and times. Not me, boykie. I'm not going down without a fight. We're doing okay here, love. One or two big crops, and we'll pay off our debts. Now, stop it, Jill. I'm sorry. It feels like I'm getting nowhere. I'm trying my best. But it's just work, work, work, and I can't stop, Jill. I hate it. I know, Angus, but it's hard on me too. But it feels like everything's on my shoulders. I can't go on like this. I want my husband back. Just take the pills. Just do something. Okay, I'll try them. I'll take these stupid pills. This is how you want your husband back? With his head full of pills? Maybe I should go and smoke some dagga with the Zulus in town. Please come back. Come, Andy. Come, boy. Come, come. Have a good day. Have you got everything? Come. Cheers, Andy. Don't forget your homework. Okay. Okay, come. Jill, how's it going at the farm? Hi, Dawn. Well, thanks. Things are well. Thank you. And how's Angus doing? Oh, you know... He's okay. We're at peace. We're good, we're okay. Do you have time for a cup of tea? It's difficult. It's very difficult. It's a lot of stress. And Angus, I worry about him. The pressure's just, you know... I thought tranquilizers would help, but they... And I wanna help, but we've lost touch. We just... The local Methodist church is having a missions breakfast on Saturday. It's a lot of fun. Why don't you guys come along and meet a few new friends? Got you, fat hog. You've been eating my corn for far too long. Where's my horse? Out now. Wait for us in the car. - Dad, we're so late. - We need to go, Daddy. Daddy will be done now. I'm not wearing this stupid tie. I look bloody ridiculous. You look fine, love. Come, let me help you. You know what? I'm not going. You take the kids. I'm staying. I'm not going without you, Angus. Please. You go. I'm not the type for church. You don't have to wear the stupid tie. Go without one. - Please come. - I'm staying, Jill. Angus, please. We need this. Jill, just stop hassling me about the tie. You're lucky I've come to this stupid meeting. Don't hush me. Come on. - Want me to bring the carry cot? - No, love. Come, boy. Let's go. Right, thank you, everybody. Good morning. Beautiful day today, isn't it? I'd like to start off reading Psalm 100. Why don't you come to church tomorrow? Local farmers are gonna be speaking. Make a joyful shout to the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with singing. Know that the Lord, he is God. Know that it is he who has made us, and that we... Jill, there's no space. Come on, let's go. There's no space. Jill, not the front row. That's when I put my hand in front of my mouth. I didn't want them to smell my breath, because I was a little bit drunk. But then the gentle guy asked: "What about you?" I was cut to the heart. My life was a mess. I had nowhere to go to. I had no interest in religion. My heart cried out for reality. Hey, Angus. Come here. Hey, Angus. Hey, Angus. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, kids. Thanks for coming to tonight's show. When you watch a show like that... ...it just shows us there's an emptiness in the hearts of all people. An emptiness that nothing but the Lord himself... For God so loved the world... ...that he gave his only son... ...so that whoever... And that means, whoever believes in him... ...will not die, but will have everlasting life. And no one can deny the reality of the testimony of Jesus Christ... ...in these men's lives. Ordinary farmer folk from this district. If you want that relationship with Jesus Christ... ...you can have it right now. Like these guys, you can invite Jesus into your life... ...and we invite you now to come forward. Receive Jesus Christ today and let him change your life. Come forward. Give your life to Jesus. Let him change you. Give him an opportunity. That's right. You'll never be the same again. My dad is a Scotsman. He moved from Aberdeenshire to Zambia... ...and then he started farming there. And like him, I'm a little bit stubborn and crazy. Like the Scotsmen gave it to the English. Lifting their kilts and shouting obscenities in battle. It's in my blood and I feel it. Now, some people think I'm a wild farmer... ...but I'm proud of my roots and I'm still gonna go to Scotland. Hey, I'm a Scottish-African. Talk about a crazy combination. Angus. Well, God loves wild men who are excited about him, Angus. He put that wildness in you. He put that wildness in you because he loves you. He loves you. He's crazy about you. It makes me think of David, dancing naked before the Lord. Actually, not naked. He was in his jocks. I'm... And I wanna give you something. I've got a little Bible around here. Or Paul and the disciples. They turned villages around. The world upside down, it says in the Bible. Crazy men. But holy. You know, I... I have this urgency in me. I feel it in my heart now. I really wanna know God. And I wanna know why he knows me, and... I don't know, what can I do? Is there something I can do? That's God's spirit in you. Tell you what. You tell the first three friends you see today what you did. Tell them you gave your life to Jesus. Now, that's a challenge. They'll think I'm a nutter. Just do it. This is the little Bible somebody gave me a long, long time ago. You'll like it. Cheerio, I just have to go to the bank to draw some money... ...but I'll be coming back this afternoon. Hey, Angus. Angus. What's up, boet? You look like death warmed up. What's wrong? You haven't been taking those happy pills, have you? No, Koos, there's something I gotta tell you. Well, you're in luck. Koos is off duty. I'll buy the drinks, you do the talking, okay? Hey, Buchy, don't look so dang serious, man. You look like the Springboks just lost against the All Blacks... ...or even worse, against the English. Okay, boet, shoot. I made a decision yesterday... ...to give my whole life, my family and my farm to Jesus. Bliksem, Buchy. You almost had me there for a second or two. You shouldn't joke about those things. No, Koos, really, I'm being serious. It's like God took me by the throat and shook me until I listened. You're not gonna turn all weird on me now, are you? Another one bites the dust. There's a breeze... eh... There's a breeze... - You mean a little bit? - Yes. - You mean a small bit? - A little bit. There's a bit of breeze but we should be fine. Yes! You got it! Yes, the grass, the bushes are a little green still. It will not burn too fast. Hey, Simeon, what do you know about Jesus? No, wait a minute. Do you know him? All I know is that he's the white man's God. No, man. What do you know about him? The women go to his church on Sundays... ...and us men drink and sleep. We've done enough on that side. We can start... No. Hey. Call the others! Quickly, quickly. I have to get help! Jill. Jill. Call the farmers. We need help. We've got a runaway fire. Angus, are you okay? - Angus? - I'm burnt. Listen up. I've got to go back into town, man. - Let me get the doctor. - No, we've gotta put the fire out first. Okay. Where can I help? Start here. The Lion Match plantation. They'll sue me. Get it, get it out. Simeon! Simeon. Simeon, we have to... ...keep the fire away from... ...Lion Match's trees! You can stay there. What things soever you desire, when you pray... ...believe that you receive them, and you shall have them. What things soever you desire, when you pray... ...believe that you shall receive them, and you shall have them. Simeon. We must pray for rain now! There will be no rain. The rain season is not here yet. We must pray for rain now! There will be no rain! The rain season is not here yet. Jesus. God, please. Simeon. Rain! Rain! Rain! Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, God! How do I do this, Lord? How must I speak to people? Tell them what's in my heart? What you've done? You make me lie down in green pastures. You still my soul. Angus? Angus. Rev. - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? - Great. - And you? - Nice to see you, good. Well, welcome to my church. - Impressive. - It's my green cathedral. God spoke to me in there. He said, "Just trust me." And I've seen some miracles. I know. I heard. - The fire breaks. - Yeah. - That's great. - I've gotta tell people, Reverend. Something's changed in my heart. I've changed. Surely, there's gotta be people out there just like me. How I used to be. Despairing. Working their heads off every day. - For what? - Yeah. You're right. Another thing, when I was in there was... It just struck me that God used ordinary people. Everyday people. Doctors, farmers like me. Incredible. Those who dared to follow Jesus and believe that He was God. Believed that he could heal the sick... ...and fix broken hearts... ...and brought messed up families back together again. Yeah. That's real faith. That's what I want. That's real faith. What you doing? Well, what are you doing? Seventeen November. I believe this day is very significant. I believe God called you. Remember this date. Seventeen November. Bongani, be careful, he's smaller than you. We'll bring the musicians and the singers... ...and anything else that's necessary. All I need is for the local ministers and pastors to tell their people to come. I wanna tell them my story. I've booked the town hall for a week. A week? Really? Come if you want to... ...but as far as I'm concerned, the town has been over-evangelized. They've heard it all before. Over-evangelized? But if there's one person... The people of Ladysmith... ...are just like the rocks and the thorn trees. Hard and dry. You will get nowhere with them. Lord, do you really want me to do this? With absolute pleasure. Not at all. You know where to get hold of me. Anytime. Okay. Okay, bye-bye now. Sorry about that, Mr. Buchan. So all you need is some help from the local church? Yes. Well, let me tell you a little story, Mr. Buchan. Three months ago, two of South Africa's great evangelists... ...came here to hold a top-notch, bells and whistles campaign. Thirty-nine people arrived, Mr. Buchan. Eighteen of them were from my church. It was an exercise in futility, preaching to the choir. Tell me, Mr. Buchan... ...who are your great evangelists that you've booked? I am. In fact, I'm the only speaker. Yeah. Well, brother... ...maybe the Lord has brought you here. To bend you a little. They look good on the outside. Inside they're a bunch of dead men's bones. I couldn't believe my ears. Andrew, finish your food. There's many churches in Ladysmith. - You would think they would have... - They sound so cold and religious. Oh, I forgot to tell you. John called earlier. Johno? How's my brother-in-law? Oh, he says he's fine. That was close, eh? Can you go and check how Fergus is doing? Oh, you know, he sounds fine. He said he'd help with the posters... ...and he'll immortalize you on videotape. Great, at least that's some good news. Come, I asked you to look in on Fergus. Come, bedtime. Angus Buchan. Oh, Brian. Thanks for calling back. Okay. That sounds fantastic, great. Okay. Bye-bye, now. Jill, some great news. That was a Pastor Brian Jubber. I left a note under his door this afternoon. He says they've been asking for the Lord to send someone. They wanna help us and they are so enthusiastic. - That's awesome. - Yeah. What's wrong? Some women have been struck by lightning. - One of them is dead! - I'm coming now. What's going on there? They're too scared to go inside. Our sister Portia is dead. She's dead in there. The other one is burnt. You told us your God is powerful. You pray. Oh, God. Jesus. Lord Jesus, help me. God, I don't know what to do. Oh, God. Bring healing to her body, Lord. In the name of Jesus, stand up! Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Lift up your hands to God! God raised you. You understand that? It is the power of God. It's not me who did this, Mama. It's not me who did this, Mama. Stand up, stand up, Mama. It's God himself who gives her life. Listen to me! Listen to me. It's the power of God that works here. Do you understand? God gives life. Thank you, God. Is it true, Nkosana? Is she alive again? God answered our prayer, Simeon. Just like when we had the fire. I was ready to bring her children to your orphanage. That won't be necessary, Simeon. Thank you, God! - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. Oh, Lord, please let me speak to them simply. Let the words you put in my heart come out. Please, Lord, speak through me. Oh, Lord, don't embarrass me. Don't embarrass me. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. No matter what you're facing... ...God can turn your situation around like that. I was speaking to a friend of mine... ...who had marital and financial problems. I was telling him, "Trust God. Just trust God. He's in control of everything." And then suddenly out of nowhere... ...this violent hailstorm came and destroyed my entire crop of maize. Razed it to the ground. The whole crop was gone. My livelihood in a few seconds, gone. What do you do? But you know what? L... I decided to put my hope in God. I decided to trust him. I didn't want to. To be honest with you, I really didn't want to. But I decided to trust God completely. And, you know what? Three days later... ...just three days... ...the entire crop just picked itself up off the ground. I was amazed. Look, it had a permanent bend in it... ...but praise God, at the end of that year... ...we had a bumper crop of seed mealies. I wanna challenge you. If God can pick up a crop of broken maize... ...how much more can he not pick up your precious broken heart? Your broken life? When God's creation is broken, he's more than able to fix it. So come on, what about you? Let God pick up your broken life today. Hey, John. Angus. How about you? Yes. Yes. Dear Lord. Thank you for John's life... ...and for what he has meant to our family. Thank you for his heart. I pray that you make him to amend things that meant to be. I pray that you would protect him and that you lift him up. In the southern part of the country... ...farmers are saying it's the worst drought in a decade. Agricultural unions have asked the government... ...to declare the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands... ...and other regions a disaster area. Many farmers are facing ruin. Would you like some more juice? Oh, thanks. Me too. Me too. I'll have some, Mommy. Please, can I have some? On the weather front, the Weather Bureau said in a statement... ...that the effects of El Ni?o will probably continue indefinitely. The region is heading for the worst drought in living memory. Farmers are losing farms at an unprecedented rate... ...and this could cause a severe blow to the Gross Domestic Product. And that is the end of the news. People are making way too much of this El Ni?o thing. Angus, I forgot to tell you... ...there were two calls for you this morning. One from a pastor in Scotland... ...who says he looks forward to meeting you. And a call asking you to come preach. Maybe... Maybe we could get someone... Maybe we should get somebody to manage the farm. I was thinking maybe we should even consider selling it. There we go. You must finish your milk. I'll farm for you, Daddy. In time, son, in good time. - I'll also farm for you, Daddy. - Me too, me too. Jilly, maybe we should get a bigger farm. That's right, we can all farm for Daddy... ...while he preaches all over the country. And all over Africa. And Zambia, and Tanzania. All the way to Cairo. Come, listen up. Thank you for your hard work today. Tomorrow, as you know, I leave for the land of my forefathers, Scotland. Please, look after Jill and my children. Simeon, you're my induna. Look after the farm, please. Steyn will manage the farm. Yes, Nkosana. We will protect Mother and the little ones. Thank you, Simeon. Thank you. - Good evening, Mama. - Good evening, Simeon. I've come to make sure you and the little ones are safe. Is everything fine? All is well, thank you. What is that bird? It's the rain bird... ...the slow, black bird that we Zulus catch easily... ...but we cannot eat. Because we can become like that stupid bird. It's the bird that calls the rain. Okay. May I ask you... ...when is Nkosana getting back from his homeland? He's been gone for so long. He's coming back next week. That's good! Sleep well. And the children. You'll be safe. You see... Nilale kalhe, my friend. Are you sure about the tie? Aye. You do know I'm ridiculously fond of you? Hey, hey, hey, you lot. I'm a crazy Scotsman, and I'm not a crazy Italian. I speak the Doric of the Werenvolk of Buchan County. What? Haven't you never seen a kilt? A man in a skirt? Well, I'll tell you what. This is what real men wear. This is what they used to wear in Scotland all the time. The sporran. If you say so, sister. Hey, that's my problem. I leave you for a few months and now you're the expert here! Somebody gave me this one as a gift when I was in Scotland. It's made of the Buchan tartan, which is my clan's colors. And it means the same to me... ...as when you put on your Zulu tribal clothing. Scotland is beautiful. It is cold and very wet there. It's the most beautiful place I've ever seen. And the people's hearts are so warm. They're so friendly. I've taken some slides. Light them up, Johno. That's me on the bridge. Standing near my father's family home in Aberdeenshire. Do the next one. A memorial to William Wallace. He was a great Scottish warrior and that is him. William Wallace defeated the English in the north of England. He's a fantastic warrior. And, of course, Angus Buchan... ...a warrior from Africa, in the middle of Scotland. Hey, Nkosana. I don't understand. If Scotland is so beautiful... ...and the people so friendly... ...and your forefathers mean so much to you... ...then why do you stay in Africa? Are there no farms there? Why do you live with the Zulus? In Zululand? Don't get me wrong, I don't disrespect you. I can see this habit... ...you white people like to be in both places. One foot is up somewhere in the north... ...and the other one here in my land! Isn't it? You are right to ask that question, Simeon. I've asked myself that question. I even prayed about it. But, you know what? I finally understood. I'm an African. I know that I have a white skin... ...but I belong to... ...a white tribe of Africans. My heritage is Scottish, and I'm proud of that. And always will be. Just like you're proud of being a Zulu. But... God wants me here. There are lots of problems between... Between black and white people, I know. And we all know how difficult it is in this country. But I really hope with all my heart that when you see me... ...you see an African brother. You see a Christian brother. Even if I'm a brother who has many faults. Let it come in. Hey, you honor me that you call me ubaba now. What is your Zulu name? Gidli... ...which means "busy and nervous one." Not everyone uses that name. You can use that name "Gidli" if you like. Okay. Thank you, my brother. Open the gate. Push it. Let it come. They brought in two more kids this morning. - AIDS orphans? - No, not these two. Their mother died of hepatitis-B. We now have almost 20 little ones to look after. We'll need to build them a bigger house. Well, God has looked after us so we can look after others. This morning in the green cathedral, he asked me three questions. What did he say to you? Are you prepared to be a fool for me? That must have been an easy question to answer. Yes, and it won't be a new experience for me. And the second question? Am I prepared for people to badmouth me... ...and persecute me because of his name? - Are you? - I'm prepared for that. But then he asked me: "Are you willing to spend less time with your family?" Well? I said, "I'll drink from that cup." God help me. I don't know, Angus. Is that really what he wants? I don't know how we'll manage with you away so often. Are you a farmer or a preacher? Thanks. I know how hard it is for you... ...to be away from us when you're preaching. And I really didn't want to sound negative about it. But we miss you. I miss you. I miss your arms around me. Whenever you see the Southern Cross... ...you can think of me and know this. My heart is with you. And I love you more than life itself. It's this wretched El Ni?o. It's a disaster. The worst drought in years. I'm telling you, some farmers are gonna go down. Peter and Jimmy are also losing their farms. What are we gonna do? What can a man do? You can't plant in dust. And I'm convinced that God wants me to organize a big prayer meeting. Get all the farmers together. We must pray about the violence and droughts and everything... ...because the problem is, every farmer thinks he's on his own. Well, feels like he's on his own. I wanna get them together and we're gonna pray. And I've spoken to Simeon and Isaiah. They said they'll speak to farm workers, get everyone together. We're gonna pray. You know how difficult it is to get Christians together? From different denominations? Let alone being black and white and Indian. Getting it together will be a miracle. You can have my church if you wanna get people together. Your church is about 300 people now. I wanna go bigger. - Well... - Come on. The town hall is about 700. - Why don't you take that? - No, I wanna go bigger. How big? Mr. Buchan. Mr. Buchan. Allen Kruger. - Good to meet you, Allen. - Have a seat. - Thanks. - How can I help you? I'd like to hire King's Park Stadium. Yeah? What for? We wanna get the farmers and their workers together... ...for a peace gathering. To pray about the violence and the murders. And the drought we're facing. Yeah, it sounds very interesting... ...but I'm not sure you've got the right place for that. No, this is the right place. Do you know how expensive it is to hire the stadium? Yeah, I've got some idea. Let me put it into perspective for you. Guys like Michael Jackson, international rock stars... ...they pay millions for this stadium. We've got the B-Field down the road here where the players practice. Shouldn't we sort you out there? No, Allen. We gotta have King's Park Stadium. Give me a few weeks and I'll get back to you. This is big. - Coming at you. - Get it. No ball. - Good one. - Catch it. How dare we laze in front of our television sets... Carol, grab the buns. - Criticize the government and the laws of the land... ...and we ourselves do nothing? I'm tired of the church not being relevant. That's why we're having this meeting. Don't get so serious, love. It's my birthday. - Fergus. - Yeah? Will you stop your brother? You know what he's like when he gets started. That will be the day. Fat chance. The Reverend Buchan has mounted the pulpit... ...and the sermon's just started. I'll get something to drink. I'll help. Quickly, Alistair, come back. There you go. Release the ball. You know, Angus, someone once said: "It's not the violence of the few that scares me... ...as much as the silence of many." That's right, sis. If we don't get off our fat backsides... ...and do something and stop complaining, who's going to? You know, God says: "If my people who are called by my name... ...will humble themselves and pray... ...seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I'll hear from heaven..." "Hear from heaven, forgive their sins, heal their land." Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fergus, that's a promise from God. Get the ball. Get the ball. Quickly, Robin. Let me sort this out. - Come on, guys. - Simeon. What's wrong? The tractor's stuck in the field. We can pull it out with this one. Where you going, Auntie Angus? The tractor's stuck in the field, my boy. We have to pull it out with another tractor. Can I go with you, Aunty Angus? No, you're gonna have to ask your dad. Daddy, can I go with her? Okay, Alistair. I'll see you later, son. Daddy, can I go too? Sure, my girl. Alistair. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Who's got the ball? Can I go too, Daddy? I'm gonna go and see if I can help them. Okay. Auntie Angus, are we going to fix the tractor? The tractor is stuck and we have to pull it out, Alistair. Where's the tractor, Uncle Angus? It's in the field, Kirstie. - Simeon. - Oh, my God. Simeon, take Kirstie. Take her home. - Alistair? - Alistair. Alistair. Alistair! Help. No. Steyn. Stop. Steyn. Help. We need help, somebody. Where's the doctor? Come. Come. Come. What happened? We had a tractor accident. Mr. Angus, just wait here. Jesus. God. Jesus, let him live. God, Jesus, please. God. God, please. Please, just let him live. Please. I'm sorry. - It's too late. - No. Angus. My son. I'm so... I'm sorry, Fergie. I'm sorry. - My son. - I'm sorry. My son. Fergus. Fergus. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It was an accident. Daddy, please don't blame yourself. All this guilt and the shame and... Just pushes up out of my gut like vomit. It's just... I can't keep it down. And I think... ...l'm not supposed to be angry. It's life. But I am angry. I get so angry that I miss him. I loved that boy. It's not your fault, Angus. I miss him. It's not your fault, Angus. I'm sorry to hear about what happened with Angus and that boy. - Thank you, it's very kind of you. - It really must have been terrible. Did Angus pray for the little boy? He's such a man of faith. You know, God could have raised him from the dead. Think what a glorious testimony that would've been. Hi, sorry I'm late. It's okay, I just got here myself. What's the matter, dear? What's wrong? You're supposed to be the one... People are so cruel and so insensitive. I'm sorry, Joanne, I'm here to comfort you. That's okay. - What happened? - Thanks. Someone said a thoughtless thing. How's Fergus doing? And the kids? How can you bear it? It's been difficult. And Fergus is really struggling. Who can understand this? Good morning. Hi. Can I get you anything to drink? - Two teas, please. - Two teas. Would you like to see the menu? No, thanks. How's Angus? Are you gonna have yours? No. You got a firearm? I have a shotgun. I shoot vermin. Give it to me. Why? Just give it to me for a while. I'll be okay. I won't do anything stupid. Daddy. My son. Alistair? - Angus Buchan. - Angus. I've seen him. Fergie, is that you? I saw him, Angus. What are you talking about? I saw Alistair, Angus. He was running in the green veld. And I spoke to him, boet. I asked him if he wanted to come back. And he said, "No, Daddy. I'm waiting for you." Thank you. Thank you. What's happening? I'll show you, you're taking too long. We'll show you how the Zulus do it. It's easy. Let's tie it around. Tie a knot there! - Hello? - Allen, hi. - It's Angus Buchan speaking. - Angus. Thank you for phoning. You won't believe it. I lost your number... ...and I couldn't remember your surname. Hey, how are you doing? No, fine, fine, it's just... It's just that it's so dry out here. We're just holding out. Yeah, I know the farmers are struggling. Well, that's why we wanna get the farmer's together. Just pray for rain, against the violence and... Well, I've got good news for you. You've got the stadium. Allen, that's fantastic. I can't let you have it for nothing but we'll do what we can to help. Great. We'll speak again soon. Okay, Allen, thanks again. Bye-bye. Yes. You got the stadium. We got it, can you believe it? Yes. Yes. It's important because... ...it's a matter of life and death. We must go and pray together at King's Park Stadium. I'm sure you guys are starting to get the drift. I'm sick and tired of the drought and violence. So that's why we're having this King's Park gathering. You know what, when I read my agricultural handbook... Then I know that's why we've got to have a peace gathering... ...and that's why I'm trying to organize at King's Park. To heck with El Ni?o. Put your trust in God. Not in a weather phenomenon. Put your trust in the creator of heaven and Earth. Not in a promise of a drought from hell. That's where El Ni?o comes from and that's where it belongs. That's why I say trust God. Trust God. Don't be gripped by the fear of what El Ni?o can do to you... ...but be gripped by what God did for you through Jesus on the cross. And I know that God answers the prayers of his people. And that's why this year at this time... ...we're going back and we're gonna plant potatoes. And you farmers know what that means. Let's ask God for a breakthrough. - That was my idea. - I know he will do it. Potatoes in the middle of a drought. That's impossible. Oh, Lord... ...hear our prayer. God, give us the rain we need. Deliver us from the violence and the murders, God. Bring peace in our land, Lord. And bring peace in our hearts. Shower this land, Lord, with your blessing. It's so dry and so thirsty, God. Bring your blessing, Lord. God says: "If my people who are called by my name... ...will humble themselves and pray... ...seek his face and turn from their wicked ways... ...then he will hear from heaven. He'll forgive their sins. And he will heal their land." He will heal our land. You've been such an inspiration to all of us, Angus. I just don't want you to make a stupid mistake, l... You know, there's a very fine line between faith and foolishness. I don't want you to... I don't think you should plant potatoes. - What do you think, Steyn? - I don't know. But Angus has been right so many times before. There's one other possibility. We could just wait a few days until it rains. I mean, look at the field. Look at the dust. Nothing can grow in this. If you plant potatoes now, they're gonna die and that's it. You know that. If God spoke to you, I mean... ...l'd be the last one who would wanna go against that, I hope. I just don't know. Did he speak to you? I just... When I prayed, I just felt God say to me: "Don't look at the weather phenomenons... ...and the weather conditions." But I needed to trust him. And then I read a scripture in Ecclesiastes and it said: "Those who observe the wind will not sow. And he who regards the clouds will not reap." - Will not reap, yeah. - Angus, sorry. The bank manager is on the line. I just hope he doesn't burn his fingers, you know? Harry? How are you? Angus, I'm concerned. About what? I see you've placed a massive order for seed, potatoes and fertilizer. That's right. That's right. No one else is planting this year. The scientists are saying it won't rain. Your farm is on the line. I don't want to see you and your family go down. Look, thanks for your concern. It really touches me. But I'm going ahead. Angus, if this crop fails, you're finished. When this crop comes through, I'm gonna own the farm, not the bank. So thanks for your concern and just relax. I'll speak to you later. - Angus, l... - Cheers. - Sorry about that, gents. - Angus. I still think it's gonna be impossible planting those potatoes. You know what? The condition for a miracle is difficulty. But for a great miracle, it's impossibility. Come on, let's go and prepare the land. Didn't mean to make it sound like I'm doubting you. God has provided for us in the past, He'll do it again. We haven't had proper rain in weeks. Soil's dry. The plants seem to be dying. We're on our knees, Reverend. People are running from everywhere... ...wanting to know how it's going with the potatoes. They should have been formed by now. What? You mean, you haven't even had a look? No, when we're ready, we'll harvest and see whatever's there. They are stuck away. How do you know there's even anything here? Look at this. No, it's not like maize. Maize you can see. But potatoes... You've got to have faith. Baba, it is time. Time to harvest. Should I dig up a row to see what is there? Gidli, my friend We'll have to wait till tomorrow. Tell the workers we should meet at sunrise to pray. And then, get ready for a long day's work. Gidli, my friend, before we get started... ...I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you. What you've done for me and my family. I don't think we would've been here if it wasn't for you. And I know you love this land as much as I do. I really appreciate you. Come, let's pray. God, thank you for this harvest and thank you for giving us the land. We don't know what's in this ground but we pray that you'll bless it. Amen. Potatoes! This will be the best ever harvest! Potatoes! Big potatoes! Yes! God. Yes. Potatoes! Big potatoes from God! Yes! Did you not think I'd have faith in these potatoes? Hey, Buchy, got to show us your potatoes. Wait till you see them. Heita, Simeon. Big potatoes. Potatoes. Hey, Jabulani, feel this potato. Smell it. Your faith in God must be like that. It must be real. You can feel it. You can smell it. Your faith, it's got to be like... It's got to be like potatoes.
