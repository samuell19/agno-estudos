Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do wasn't given much credit in the past. Martial Arts masters believed it was created only to win fights. Bruce Lee in FIST OF FURY Back then kids worshipped Bruce Lee. He was my hero. My friends and I became close easily because we all had the common bond of liking Bruce Lee. To me, he was the coolest strongest guy on Earth. And I dreamt about becoming like Bruce Lee. Jeet Kune Do doesn't teach you to look back but to go forward once the path is set. -- From Bruce Lee's 'Way of Jeet Kune Do' Everybody has unforgettable moments of their lives. For me, it was the year 1978. In the spring, we moved to the Gangnam area of Seoul. My mom foresaw real estate prices skyrocketing in this area. KWON Sang-woo LEE Jung-jin Rat alert! HAN Ga-In Squeeze in! Stop pushing, boys I might get a hard-on. Slow down! I transferred to Jungmoon High on Maljuk Street. I'd heard things about it, and I hoped they weren't true.

There is nothing you can't do if you focus. Martial arts and studying are no different. Make sure you get within the top five of your class. My father ran a Taekwondo gym. He was a gentle martial artist to neighbours. But he was a violent father. With me, he preferred using his fists to words. - I won again! - Won! Stabber, come with me to the student patrols' office. What for? - You went to the cafeteria. - So? Asshole, you washed your hair in the water tank. Says who? Don't play dumb, shithead. There's a witness. Jong-Hoon Cha Pipe down.

Hell no. Hamburger, that asshole... You're a good basketball player. Nah, you're better. Why do you let Stabber fuck you around? I don't wanna fight. Never been in a fight. Throw the first punch. Know what I'm saying? Hit first. Take the initiative. That's what wins the fight. I should go to a military academy. Good to be an army general. He calls, they let us walk. You passed out when she kicked you. What? Who says I passed out? I came right to. Knocked out by a chick? I'd choke over that rice if I were you. So I mixed it with water. You need to train harder. 'The Game of Death'! Damn, he's at it again. - I'll take you all on! - Okay! That's not it. What are you, an over-weight version of Bruce Lee? Hair... It hurts! Hyeon-Soo, you're on. - She's Bruce's squeeze. - No, Tin Fei is. - Kum-Yong Girls' high school - Who's that? She was in 'Girls'. Oh, that one. - Let's go to a disco tonight. - You're unbelievable. You have a black eye, man. Chicks there are great. That has nothing to do with you, does it? - You're going, right? - Sure - Go for it. - Hey Let me take your bag. - No thanks. - Let me. - It's okay. - I insist!

Who the fuck are you? Beat it. You had your fun, didn't you? Hell no. Give it back, and we'll talk. Stay back. I can't believe this. Have you lost your mind? I'm your senior, and... Son of a bitch! Stop the bus! Get off! All of you! Wait for me! Fuck! Stop right there, fuckers! Keep running! - Stop right there! - Stop! Let's split. You come with me. Meet us at the bus stop. Which way did they go? Stay put here. We've gotta go. - I can't - Come on! Where the fuck did these... They must've gone the other way. Let's go. Get out of there, fuckers. - Come out of there. - Fuck! What were you doing there? Making out? Where's the other two? Where are they? He's the Kingpin of our class. You know what I mean? He's a real fighter. Once he took on 8 alone and kicked their asses. I see. Sorry if I got you in trouble. It's okay. A true victory is winning without using force. Hi, boys and girls. I'm Jun Jin-Woo. Mr. Cool on the block. Ma'am, noodles for table number 3, please. Boys are not so cute. But she's such a hottie. Mr. Cool my fucking ass! Watch your mouth, man. What's your name? Name's Kang Eun-Ju. I'm a senior. Going to college next year? What do you wanna study? Show me some respect. I know you're a junior. We're the same age. I failed a grade. His mom is a famous actress. Shut the fuck up. And his father is a pillar of the community. You didn't fail a grade, did you? Thanks for earlier. I didn't do anything. I've seen you before on the bus. Really? You had the earphones on. You must like music. Yeah, I like American pop songs. American songs? That's something. Who do you like? Elton John and Chelsia Chan. And one of the ABBA members. She's blonde. - Oh, that blonde chick... - Agnetha? That's right, I like her. Oh, Agne... What are you doing tonight? Let's go to a disco. - Thanks. - Thank you. You should've let us pay. No, I wanted to. I've gotta go now. - Bye - Bye Thank you so much for today. She's leaving like that? I've gotta go. See you. That asshole got us in a big fucking trouble. He can't control himself before cute chicks. I bet he's all over her by now. What do you think? That bitch is so uptight. "Show me some respect. I know you're a junior." Bye - This bag... - Your bag, Hyeon-Soo. What's gotten into you? Stop bullshitting me, man. I'm not! Doesn't she look like Olivia Hussey? It's all your fault she left us like that. By the way, I'm so nervous. If they come, they come. Damn, I should've been there. How'd it go with her? - Did you fuck her? - What? Who is it? Those two. That fucking pig! Get in! Against the wall! Against the wall! Better bite your teeth hard. - Put them down, man. - Fuckface! - You can do better than that. - Hit harder! That's it! You're famous on Maljuk, huh? You're such a big shot? Hit me again. Hit me again, fucker. Hit me if you can. Come on. Come on, motherfuckers! You should've kept your cool. Once I let them fuck with me. I'm through, man. Let me apologize again. He's just hot-blooded. Don't worry. - Take good care of my son. - Sure. - Thanks, Goodbye. - Bye. Thanks to his mom Woo-Shik didn't get suspended. She starred in TV dramas mostly as a kitchen maid. - That's Maid Bong! - Yes, Maid Bong. After that incident Woo-Shik became famous. And seniors left him alone. You fight again and I'm telling your dad. - Hamburger. - Yeah? Delivery to the stationery shop. - I'll be right back. - Thanks. I can't believe that idiot. She's not gonna give it to him. Leave him alone. How are things going with her? Who? You know... Eun-Ju Her? That bitch turns me off. Why? Let me tell you. She's one hard nut to crack. Really? I thought she liked you. I went after her that day but she just blew me off. She's just too uptight. Hey, why do you ask? I was just curious. You like her? Then, go for it. - No way. - Sorry to keep you waiting. I haven't seen you for ages. I think you get prettier by the day. Really? You look skinnier, Hyeon-Soo. - I do? - Yes Because I haven't eaten your seasoned rice cakes lately? I'm not kidding. I think you've lost weight. Drop by anytime you want. I'll make it special for you. For free? Of course! Your money isn't good here. Wait. Let me get you boys some fritters. On the house. I can't let this chance go by. Be a man, Hyeon-Soo. Here's your chance. Muster up the courage. Call her. Now! - Go with me. - Hurry up! I knew it was you. Hi, Hyeon-Soo. Hi. How did you... I thought I saw you, so I came running - to make sure. - I see. It's been a while. How have you been? Fine, How about you? Good. What number do you take home? Bus 78. I take that one, too. We can go together then. That's great. How'd you recognize me? Are you kidding? We ran together, remember? Right! You go to this institute? Huh? Yeah. Never seen you here before. Me neither. Did you have dinner? Not yet. You can use this. No, it's okay. Go ahead. You might catch a cold. I'm okay. Thanks. It's Chelsia Chan. Wasn't it hard to run with me? Not at all, it was fun. Fun? Not for me. I was so scared of that rat. So was I. Shame on your seniors. Didn't they retaliate against you and Woo-Shik? No. Woo-Shik is cool, isn't he? Such a tough guy. But he's got no manners. You're different. Am I? Your mouth... You like music, right? What's your favourite radio program? 'Love Songs of Eve' That's my favourite, too! I even sent a postcard, too. But, they never aired my request. You only wrote down your request? Yeah. Next time, draw something cute. Or paste a flower on it. That always works. Really? Have you done it? No. I will, when I have a girlfriend. Oh, that's so sweet. It's been a year since we broke up. When it rains, I keep thinking... Did you listen to it last night? No, I didn't. 'Runway' was on the air singing live. Really? I'm sorry I missed it. 'Feelings' by Morris Albert The guitar is great in this song. Yeah, It sounds even better on a rainy day. Do you play the guitar? Huh? A little bit. That's cool. Good enough to be in a competition? No, not that good. I'd like to hear you play some day. You mean it? Sure. I'm getting off here. It was so nice seeing you. It really was. - You can take this. - No, I'm okay. Take it, I can run home. - No, I'm okay. - Please. Bye. Hyeon-Soo! 'How am I gonna live with you gone...' What's up with you? Got laid or something? I might get into a competition. I'd be damned if you did. 'I can't live without you. Please, don't go...' Stop selling these, man. You'll pay my tuition then? Did you bring it? 'Horse Penis' and 'Honey Jar'. Good. Stop jacking off into the book. Fuck you. Getting a hard-on? Shake it hard, baby. You guys are pathetic. What are you, his bank? Eat it. This is awesome! If you keep reading those, I bet you'll never get laid. You'll jack off to death. I don't jack off any more. He's pouting again. Want some? Why'd you miss school yesterday? I was sick. What happened to your hand? Got into a fight again? No way. Our politics had been abusing Western democracy. Revitalizing Reform was put to an end to this... Not now, asshole. Put it away! Its meaning can be boiled down to 5 things. Give it here. What's going on back there? Bring it up here. What's this? 'Horse Penis and Wet Pussy'? Smiling? You ducked? A huge mistake, punk. - I'm just... - Bite your teeth hard. Bite them hard! You useless bastard. What the... Staring at me? Son of a bitch! Stand straight. Is that your book? No, sir. Then whose? Say it! You're really gonna get it. It's Hamburger's. Hamburger? Ham Jaebok. Who's Ham Jaebok? Get your ass up here! God damn it! Is this yours? Open your mouth. Do you ever study? Sons of bitches like you do democracy no good. You stinking dog! Because I don't have a general for a father? How could he rat on me? I've been carrying his bag for over 3 years. What's gonna happen to you? Beats me. I hope they don't expel me. I'm not going to let him get away with this. Hamburger! Hey, bitch! Go say sorry. It was his, wasn't it? Oh, I almost forgot. Your umbrella. You go to the same institute with her? She asked me to thank you for her. You met her? You know I never give up. You know what happened? I put on a show the other night. She was so difficult. I followed her for a few days. When it rained the other night. I staked out her place. About 1 in the morning she comes out of the house. And she feels sorry for me soaked to the bones. Then I see the chance. I punch the wall real hard. Blood all over my hand... You should've seen the look on her face. She brings out a bandage and wraps up my hand Didn't that feel great! So I say to her... "I could die for you." Next minute, she's all mine. Woo-Shik got so easily what I'd desired so badly. All I could do for Eun-Ju was... share an umbrella. Hey, wake up. Hey. Still sleeping? - Did you run into Eun-Ju on your way in? - No. Don't tell her I slept. Why not? I promised to give her a buck each time I sleep here. I think she's good for you. Why's that? Look at you. You're at the library. So tiring to date a model student. She gets upset if I go to a disco. My mom likes her, though. Damn, I miss dating sluts. Woo-Shik, put that out. Hey there. Hi. Hey, When'd you get here? Just now. He slept again, didn't he? I didn't. I don't believe you. Open your hand. Go ahead. Happy birthday. You didn't have to do this. What is it? A cassette tape. I had songs recorded at the record shop. Dance music? Is that all you think about? It's your birthday? Why didn't you tell me? It's not important. Happy birthday. I'll leave you guys alone. Where are you going? Come with us. No, I'm okay. What's wrong with Hyeon-Soo? He doesn't like dancing. I'll bring him out. Why aren't you dancing? Come on, dance with us. I'm not a good dancer. Neither am I. Have you been here before? Once with Woo-Shik. - He's a regular here, isn't he? - No. - You don't think I'm bad, do you? - Why? 'Cause I'm at a disco when I should be studying. Don't you wanna dance? Sit next to him. - Let's dance. - No. Let's go. You like this song? I hardly listen to Korean songs, but this one's great. She's cute. Hook her up with Hyeon-Soo. Wanna dance? Who is it? Oh, Hyeon-Soo. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Can I have some rice cake? - Sure, Sit down. Wanna drink? Huh? No thanks. Go ahead. You're old enough to drink. Studying is stressful, isn't it? That's what I do, though. You sure can drink. What's bothering you? Problems with your girlfriend? What's bothering you? Problems with your girlfriend? - No. - Then what? I've had a huge crush on this girl. Yeah? But I'll have to let it go now. Why? She doesn't even know that I like her. Why don't you tell her? You sure you're a man? One thing's for sure. She's got bad taste in men. Drink and get over her. Drinking got me so hot. Let me go get more beer You remind me of my old days. I had so many things that I wanted to do. Time sure does fly. Do what your heart says. Gosh, so tight. You're cuter up close. It's quite late I gotta go. Nobody will walk in on us. Touch me. Let me unzip you. It's okay Let me do it. What's wrong? Run faster! The gates are closing! Run! Run, bastards! I couldn't get a hold of you What happened? I was away for the weekend. Isn't that Hamburger? Hey, Hamburger! You're finally off suspension. Good to have you back, bitch. Cut it out, okay? He makes me laugh. Cute, isn't he? What's up with him? He's joined the Wild Horse Gang. Jong-Hoon's gang. Really? Make your bet. Two and one. You win if it's threefold. Yes! - I won! - Not so fast, wise-ass. Dizzy, huh? I'm now officially feeling sorry. We're not done yet. Let's call it a day. - Hell no. - Your eyes are popping out. Stop gambling, losers. It's just for fun. - You got money? - I'm broke. Stakes are quite large. And he cleaned out. Shut up, asshole. Stabber, this isn't a casino. Wrap it up. Up your ass. Let's go. Wrap it up, dickhead. I hear a little bird chirping. Do you? Here we go. Fucking asshole! Seong-Hun, come on in. What if I say no? Son of a bitch! Hit me. Let me make big bucks. Take your best shot. Hit me, and see what happens. Don't rough me up. Come on, hit me if you... Get the fuck up, asshole. You don't mess with me Tell me, shithead. How much do you want? That's it? One punch, and you're out? Want me to get you up? That's enough. Are you okay? What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Being a student patrol doesn't mean you can beat people up. What? What the... Hey, get up. Your guts are gonna spill all over. Attention! Attention! You can't boss me around. Stand straight. - That's enough, Jong-Hoon. - Stay out of this. Hey, motherfucker! What the fuck are you doing? Your class is fucked up. Who told you to come in here? I need your permission? Shut the fuck up. Keep it up, and you will get your ass kicked. What? Get my ass kicked? Wanna have a go? See who gets his ass kicked? Why the fuck not? But not now. Log AX becomes... Log AX + Log AY, okay? The third one is... Where were you? You messed up again? Go sit down. You'll be better off at a factory. It's 2 Log2, 4 + Log 2, 8 Then take this 2 and put it over 4. Why? 'Cause this is a pattern. Math isn't about logic, but what? Patterns! You fucking snitch! Why don't you call your daddy? Here's your money. Call your fucking daddy. - You crazy bastard! - Did I steal your money? What happened? Who did this? One of the kids stabbed him with a pen - With a pen? - They were fooling around, and... How do you teach your students? You call this fooling around? I'll hold you responsible for this. Let me carry him. Call General Park and expel that bastard! But you gave me your word. I told you everything, didn't I? You expect me to buy that? Stop lying to me. I know you went to a disco last night. God damn it! Whatever I do it's none of your damn business - What? - You're a senior, Aren't you? Studying for college? You're so mean, Woo-Shik. Just figured that out? Fuck it! You're such a pain. We're through. You're still here. Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. Is it Woo-Shik? No, that's not it. I'm just tired. Tired of studying. Hang in there. The SAT isn't far away. I know. Maybe it'll rain tomorrow. Not a single star out. Yeah. I came up here to listen to the radio. Wanna join me? Sure. Next week is 'Environment Clean Up Week'. So each student should do his best to... Look at this bastard. Miss the morning meeting and sleep here? Who says you can miss the school meeting? Stop hitting me, man. I'm getting expelled soon. What'd you say, wise-ass? Better watch what you say. You unruly scumbag! - How dare you... - Fucking asshole! Let go! You're a soldier, so what? You like beating up people? - I do, too! - Get this psycho off me! - How does it feel? - Get him off! It was decided this morning at a teachers' meeting. As of today all the juniors and seniors will change classrooms after the fourth class. You'll be in either a Superior or Inferior class. Our principal made it. Nobody outside the school should know about this. Let me tell you again. This is for your own good. So don't be upset if you fall into an Inferior class. Understood? Your grades have gotten way worse. What's gotten into you? I thought you were better than this. Bring your mom to school. The new class system begins now. Go to your designated classrooms. You boys know what Nouns are? If you don't, go kick the bucket. As you can see here there are 5 types of nouns in English. Collective, Material, Proper Abstract, and Common nouns. By initials, CMPAC. When 'C'ock 'M'eets 'P'ussy 'A'n orgasm is 'C'reated. You get the idea? Funny, huh? Are you getting horny? Even those with IQs of 30 should remember this. If you don't think you can then drop out of school Repeat after me... C, M, P, A, C C, M, P, A, C Hyeon-Soo Eun-Ju How are you? Good. It's been a while. You sure can drink. Were you surprised that I took you here? Yeah. Have you been here before? A few times with Woo-Shik. Sometimes I don't understand how you guys are friends. Neither do I. Hyeon-Soo... I like you a lot. I feel more comfortable with you than with my female friends. You do? I don't. When I'm with you... I feel uneasy. Let me tell you a story. A crazy artist loved this girl so much. But her parents hated him. So he said to them... Let me be with her... for as long as I can endure my hand... in a candle's flame. How romantic. No more. You're drunk. Do me a favour. Woo-Shik gave me that pen. Return it to him for me. I'm sorry. - Hyeon-Soo - Huh? It'd be nice if time froze now. What? You mean that? Sure, Why not? Thanks for the ride. - Good night - Bye Next is a postcard from Kim Hyeon-Soo. One night, a girl came running under my umbrella. My heart still lingers on that night street. Then I believed we shared the same soul. But she loves someone else. A man who makes her shed tears. Sadly, there isn't a thing I can do for her. She often makes me feel that the world has ended. I wish I could get over her like the umbrella I left on the bus. Looking at his drawing I can tell he has a pure soul. Hyeon-Soo, don't give up. I hope things work out with her. 'One Summer Night' by Chelsia Chan and ABBA What do you have to tell me? What is it? Eun-Ju asked me to return this to you. I got it a few days ago. - But I didn't know whether... - I don't need it. You can have it. But it's yours. Are you seeing her? What? No need to be surprised. You can have her. Let me tell you, she's a great shag. Do you think it's cool to talk like that? What? You fucked her, didn't you? Yummy, huh? That's right, asshole. I fucked her. You fucking hit me? Motherfucker! Try to put me down, asshole! Knock it off! Friends don't fight! That dickhead isn't thankful. I've hung out with him. Yeah, thank you so much! Let go of me. Okay, let go. You can fight, huh? Woo-Shik... Puppet Solider is up! - Get off of me! - What the hell is that? What's going on here? What are you, mobsters? Pigs are better than you. You're really something aren't you? I warned you before, didn't I? What does your father do? What does he do? He runs a Taekwondo gym. A Taekwondo gym? So he raised you to be a punk. Tell me. Did your old man teach you to fight at school? Did he? Did he, asshole? What's this? Let go of my arm. Let go, asshole! You fucking bastard! Get over here! Teachers should be treated with utmost respect! You know how many Viet Cong I killed in Vietnam? Do you remember the story from Kim Hyeon-Soo? I introduced it to you a few days ago. The girl who ran into his umbrella wrote to me in reply. Hyeon-Soo, are you listening? I listened to it on the bus, and I decided to write back. I had no idea what I'd put him through. If I'd known, I wouldn't have returned the umbrella like that. He feels the world has ended... It breaks my heart. It's 2:00 am now. I often think of that night on the bus. I hope he doesn't feel that it's over. 'Feelings' by Morris Albert Hyeon-Soo... You're late. Yeah. What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. What happened to your face? I didn't expect a reply. You go to the library to listen to the radio? I didn't think she'd read it. I didn't draw or paste a flower. Eun-Ju, let's take a train trip. A train trip? Yeah. To get some fresh air. And I'd like to keep my promise. What promise? You said you'd like to hear me play the guitar. Right... I did. Will you, on this trip? Sure. 'Your silence 'and my dried lips' 'Deep in my cold eyes 'Your footsteps... frozen like rocks' Sing along! 'Words heard from behind... I'm so glad we came. Drink this. 'Your silence 'and my dried lips' 'Deep in my cold eyes 'Your footsteps frozen like rocks' 'Words heard from behind' 'Not "I love you" 'but "Good-bye" 'Words carrying tears... Is your mom okay with this? I'm at the library now. Remember? I'll be bored. Once you go to college you won't see me. Don't worry. I'll study for one more year. I remember the time I first saw you on the bus. What about it? I was so glad I transferred. Frankly... When I first saw you on the bus... I liked you. Do I look cool? I've always wanted to learn. The second string. How much? Five bucks for all. Hey, fuckers. What's going on? - Hey, a wild horse! - Give it back. Jong-Hoon's chick? Go ask him yourself. What the... Give them back. You sell these to buy glue for Jong-Hoon to sniff? Sell them somewhere else. Fucking parasite! What are you looking at? What a pathetic loser. You went to the cafeteria again? Die! Fucker! You poured acid on me? Kim Woo-Shik! Come up to the roof. Let's end it once and for all. Get your ass up! Go lick Puppet Solder's boots, unless you wanna die. Hey, kitchen maid's son. What? What'd you just call me? Kitchen maid's son. You got it, asshole. Let's go! Hit his face! One more! Out of the way. Get the fuck out of the way. Students, go back to your classrooms. A school inspector is on his way to our school. Go back to your classrooms. A school inspector is on his way. Hurry back to your classrooms. Woo-Shik Woo-Shik! I couldn't call out to him any more. Someone had sent an anonymous letter to the school inspector on the new class system. It must be one of the kids in the Inferior classes. They're fucked. The school inspector was hiding in the outhouse. No more Inferior classes? You fools do nothing but talk. I sent the letter, man. - Bullshit. - Go clean the bathroom. Be thankful to me. We study with smart ones and what? We became smart, too? Hell no! Have you heard about Woo-Shik? No? He took off... with a girl from Eunmyung. Says who? His mom was here earlier. I bet it's Eun-Ju. Model student my ass! I knew she was a horny bitch. What? What makes you so sure? You didn't see them. What are you getting upset at me for? You really don't know? No. I haven't seen him since that day. Where the hell is he then? If you hear from him let me know. I heard... He ran away with a girl. Is that true? You know her? Huh? No. Eun-Ju... Eun-Ju Eun-Ju! Eun-Ju! You bastard! You call yourself human? Look at this. You call these grades? You think you can go to college? Do yourself a big favour. Drop out of school and start temping for peanuts! I'm not going to college. I'll drop out! What? You bastard! You know what you become without a degree? 'A surplus man'! You know what that means? You're nothing but waste! You think you're a smart ass? Then get out of my house! What the... Yeah, I was a surplus man. I had no dreams left in me. Not a thing that I was to do or that I wanted to do. Then I had an urge to jump. Like those raindrops falling... I felt like falling, too. Hamburger! How are you doing, Bruce? Welcome, Brother Jong-Hoon. You've got tits, man. Up your ass. Fuck you. Your fly is open. I prefer the Inferior class. Those in the Superior class do nothing but study. I should hang out here from now on. Hamburger, go ahead. Show me some moves. If you wish, Bro. I'm fine. It's nothing. It gave me a hard-on. He thinks his Bruce Lee. Fool! Cheetah We need to talk. You wanna quit school? Why don't you rat on me, too? You're not smart, so what? Morality is all that counts. You go to a good college but you're immoral. Then what's the point? Many people make it big in life without a degree. This new class system is for your own good. Why can't you see that? We're not playing favoritism. And someone had to send an anonymous letter. How would that make us feel? Being a righteous person is far more important than getting into a good college. Where are you going? Hey, Woo-Shik's sidekick! Did you just glare at me? Don't make faces at me. Keep your eyes down. Keep them down. Fucking asshole! - Leave him alone. - Let go. - Think of your rep, man. - Let go! Hyeon-Soo, you wanna get your ass kicked too? I'll poke your eyes out. Keep them down! Let's go, man. Hey. Watch it, okay? Let's go. "I'll poke your eyes out." "Keep them down!" "Wanna get your ass kicked?" I finally found something to do. My path was set. Stand closer. Next! How much? All these? Stop it. You are such an idiot! Fuck, Woo-Kyung and Sung-Kuk are Dumb and Dumber. What'd you just say? Say it again. Wanna get it on? Wanna get it on? Come up to the roof now. I'll crash your fucking head in! - Button up. - Loyalty! Stand over there. Loyalty! - Loyalty! - Loyalty! Loyalty! It was such a close game. Evade one, two, three... shoot! It's way off. Right? One day I'll kill him. - Who? - That asshole. - Let go! - Jong-Hoon? Yeah, that fucker. Should I throw this at him? Go ahead. - Idiot! - I know you've got no balls. - I do. - Prove it then. - What if I do? - I'll give you a buck. No way, he's... Are you out of your fucking mind?! Shit. Who threw this at me? Who threw it? Did you? - I didn't - Whoever did it, come clean. Close the door. Who threw it?! Get your ass up! Did you? Cut it out, man. It's not from our classroom. Get out. Get your hands off me! Who did it? I've got my rep to save here. Get the fuck away! Damn, this is embarrassing. Come on, let's go. Close the back door. You stinking pig! Close the fucking door! Who do you think you are? You useless mouth! Forgive me! I'm sorry. Forgive me! You fucking son of a bitch! Let's take it outside. You think you're such a fighter? Come up to the roof. Have you lost your mind? What are you on, fuckface? You stooges stay out of this! - You fucking... - Leave him be. Follow me, motherfucker. I'll make it quick for you. Fucker! Get out of the way! Come on, motherfucker! Assholes. Come on, fuckers! Fucker! What the hell's going on? That fucking bastard! What are you doing? Get him! Call the cops! Fuck! Fuck all the schools in Korea! I can't believe he beat up my precious son. Mom, that's enough. I know how you must feel. I'm really sorry. Your son should rot in jail! Look what he did to him. He's a monster! I'm sorry. As his father, I can't tell you how sorry I am. Please, forgive him. We've got nothing more to say. Please leave. It's my fault. I didn't teach him right. Please, forgive him. I'm begging you. Father... I'm sorry. It's, okay. You can take the GED. Did Bruce Lee go to college? He didn't hit me that day. We kept walking in silence The road that I walked to and from school... It felt so much shorter. Square it and multiply it. Right? Therefore... When X is 2, the minimal number is 5. So X equals... Y's the minimal number - 8 squared + B squared... The notice for the GED is on the bulletin board. Please, make sure you check it. - How about two bucks? - Okay! No Japanese porn? You can trade that in for Japanese porn later for only two bucks. Don't pass them around. - Are you sure? - Hamburger! You can count on me. Hyeon-Soo! - I can't believe it. - What? You got kicked out right before graduation? I told you I quit, man. My elementary knowledge is poor. I'll study my ass out here and go to college. How are Seong-Hun and Cheetah? They're fine. I miss them. Any word from Woo-Shik? No. He wouldn't call me, would he? By the way, I saw Eun-Ju. She's restudying for college at this institute. Taking off with Woo-Shik and all that... I knew she wouldn't make it. That song was introduced in 1974... - Bye, Eun-Ju - Bye The fun thing is that one of the ABBA members... - All right! - Was preparing to give birth... When the song festival was planned But, ABBA still preformed that day... Eun-Ju And the year after that they introduced... It's been a while. Yeah. Going home? Right. How have you been? Your hair grew a lot. Oh... I dropped out. So nice seeing you. It's been what, a year? Right. What are you up to? I go to an institute for the GED. So I can go to college. - You? - Me? I'm restudying for college. It's quite cold, isn't it? Yeah. It wasn't this cold this time last year. Hanam District! - I'm getting off here. - Okay. - Hyeon-Soo - Huh? Nothing. Bye. Bye. All right! I can't believe you haven't seen 'Drunken Master'! - It doesn't look good. - Trust me on this. But you've seen it. Let's watch something else. It's better the second time. - My treat. - No way. Better than Bruce Lee's movies? Way better! You'll find out soon. Jackie Chan is awesome. Bullshit. Bruce Lee rules. He's history, man. Bruce Lee rocks! Not before Jackie Chan! Chi-Pa-Sa, Chong-Yi-Chen! What are you, drunk? Wanna fight, Bruce Lee? Why not? You got it. Come up to the roof, asshole. edit by necroboi (v2)
