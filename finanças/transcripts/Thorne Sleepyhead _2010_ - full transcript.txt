Round the back! Let's go! Hey! He's right there! - Come on! - Over there! Come on! He's round the back! Come on! I've got it! ...gonna marry her. I found her! I found her! She was already dead! She was already dead! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! It... it wasn't me! - Stay there. - Jesus. Possible ABH. Female victim. She's been here a while. No blood. No sign of a struggle. What do you think, she fell, hit her head? Heart attack? Hello? What's got a one-inch knob and hangs down? I don't know. What has a one-inch knob and hangs down? A bat. Your mother's got me on this diet. My pee smells of stewed cabbage. Oh, yeah? That's nice. Listen, what is it, Dad? I'm at work, all right? - What's got a nine-inch knob and hangs up? - I don't know. What has a nine... Natural causes, then, sir? - You want to call Borough, let them handle it? - No. You think this is a crime scene. Yeah, I do. Call it in. And, er... call Phil Hendricks. Ow! Ow! - Ow, that's my neck, Phil! - Shut up. You're mashed out on midazolam. With a sedative that strong, I can do anything I like. Now, I just bend your head a few degrees this way, apply pressure to these points here to kink the artery, and it's good night, Tom Thorne. So she wasn't strangled, then? That's what I've been trying to tell you. - It's a bit elaborate, isn't it? - Yeah. If it wasn't for the midazolam, the tranquilliser, I would have said ischaemia. I presume that that was the idea, make it look like a stroke. Natural causes. - What, a stroke? She's only 28. - You see it. Smokers. On the pill. So the only suspicious indicators we've got are these bruises and the sedative, yeah? Yeah, looks like a left-hander. If she's the only one that we found... How many have you missed? What have you got for me? What is this, the Pussycat Dolls? We circulated the indications to pathologists in the southeast on Tuesday. Came up with two further matches. Madeleine Vickery, deceased February '09. Christine Owen, died April. That's three dead girls and all looked like strokes. Looks like a stroke, quacks like a stroke. How do I know it isn't one? We don't, but even if I dig up Madeleine and Christine, the bodies are 12 and 14 months old. So, no use to us. But all three are under 30. All three died of ischaemic strokes. Oedema in the same places. Upper neck, both sides. A bit deeper on the left. So, our guy's left-handed? We picked up a partial print from the Carlish flat. Puma, size nine. But not from the guy who tripped over her, right? No, he wears a ten and he's a thief, not a multiple killer. So he must be trained, medical. There'll be more. Why not? He's careful. There's no sexual assault, no heat. All three girls were found in their flat. There was no forced entry, no sign of a struggle. - He's there and he's gone. - Sounds like the fucking angel of death. Yeah, wearing size nine Pumas. I'll take care of you. Hello, Alison. Are you OK? Are you in any pain? I can't see! I can't see! I'm going to help you, Alison. I'm going to take care of you now. Don't worry. I'm here. You're sleepy. I attended service at a little church in the country not long ago. A prayer was led by an old country preacher, who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang My God Is Real. A warm breeze through the open windows brought in the smell of new-mown hay in a nearby field and the singing of birds could be heard in the moment of silence... Er... Alison Willetts, 23. That's good work. Well done. Holland, sir, David. Dave. Yeah, I knew that. Actually, it weren't me, really. Hospital called it in as suspicious a week ago. Didn't seem like much of a priority then. - Want some free advice, Dave? - Sir? Take the credit. Come on. I suppose she's lucky, this one, Alison? - Oh, so a coma's lucky in Dave world? - Luckier than dead. Yvonne? Where am I going? - Third floor, Neurology, ICU. - Look after this one for us, will you? - Hi. - You all right? Jesus. Over there. Should be all right. Thanks for taking the time to talk to us, Mr Ramsey. Sir, can I have your full name, please? Now, you're the one who found Miss Willetts, aren't you? Yeah, I found her passed out in the car park. I almost left her, I was so late for work. I just, er... I thought she was drunk. No, you did great. She probably wouldn't have survived if it wasn't for you. What part of the States are you from, Josh? The Canadian part. What time exactly did you find Miss Willetts? Oh, it's too bright. Turn the light off. Light hurts. Oh, my God. Am I in hospital? I'm OK, right? I'm alive? Alison? Are you a doctor? Oh, you don't look like a doctor. Alison, can you hear me? Yes. - Alison? - You're the deaf one. Alison, um... My name's, er... Tom. - Tom Thorne. I'm a police officer. - You've got kind eyes, Tom. Can I ask you some questions about what happened to you? I... don't remember. Why are... are you looking at me like that? What's wrong with me? What happened to me? - Tell me! Tell me what happened to me! - What's going on? - Is she all right? - Tom! Why can't you hear me? Why? I'm talking to you! - Alison. Everything's all right. - Please! - You're in a hospital. - Please help me! You've been unconscious for over a week. - Please help me. - But you're awake now. I'm your doctor. My name's Anne. I'm going to be looking after you, OK? OK. So, we had her down as a straightforward stroke at first. - You know she was found in the car park? - Yeah. Yeah, we presumed that she'd collapsed on her way to A&E, but then one of my housemen saw bruising, oedema around her neck ligaments, which came up as bright white patches on her MRI scan. Sorry, are you pissed off with us? Yeah, well, we called you a whole week ago. It's been a week. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. What's wrong with her? She can see me and hear me. Yes, yes, she's got locked-in syndrome. The damages to the ventral part of the pons. It's characterised by complete paralysis of all voluntary muscle function in the body, apart from those which control eye movement. So, her brain works, she can hear you, she can understand everything, but she can't move. It's like waking up in your own coffin. Her, um... A friend reported her missing. Have you heard from the family at all? Her mother died and so her father remarried and moved to Palm Springs. When I called him to tell him the news, he actually asked me if it was worth him coming to visit. So... So, you know, she's got a lot to come to terms with without some six foot something... Three. ...detective standing over her bedside. - The thing is, Doctor, um... - Coburn. Coburn. We've got three girls just like Alison. Same bruising, same indications, only they're dead. So if there's any chance that she can communicate, you know. Well, if she does communicate, it's gonna be minimal. And there's no guarantee that she'll remember anything. It's very unlikely that she's gonna regain any motor function. She'll succumb to an infection and she'll die in that bed. So, I really hope she's not your only line of inquiry. You have to excuse me. Yeah, perhaps you could come down to A&E. That's really all I can tell you. I... I found her. I handed her over to Dr Bishop and he... he took her up to ICU. I really have to get back to work. Good luck with this. Shit. Please move it now. Mr Ramsey. Josh. - Get off me! Get off me! - Hey, calm down! Calm... calm down! Well, he is left-handed. And he does take size nines, apparently. According to his entry visa, Mr Ramsey hadn't entered the country till six months after the murders began. Yeah, could hamper a conviction, couldn't it? Yeah. Holland's what, 12? Give him a break. Oh, rookie with an instinct. I should have known he'd be up your street, Tom. Henry'll be going nuts. Is, er... Henry your partner, Mr Ramsey? He's my dog. Right. So, I'm free to leave? Just one minute, please. He said that she was wearing something white, like a slip or something, when he found her. Not the clothes she'd been wearing, sir. Everybody's laughing at me. Except Thorne. He just looks right through you. Well, you can't blame him. Not much of a first-team debut, was it, Dave? Yep. Thorne's first time out, cracks the Pretty Boy Killer. Mine? Make a big mess of. Well, you've heard how he done it, ain't you? Come on. Everyone knows that. Tom just shook Frank Calvert by the hand. He looked into his eyes and he just knows this is the one. This is the guy that's killed those six gay men. This is the Pretty Boy Killer. - Bollocks. - Bollocks? It's the rock the church was built on. If only they'd listened to him back then, right? They listen to him now. Mr Thorne. - Hello. - Hi. Um... listen, I, er... I thought we could go together. You know, if you didn't have any other plans. Yeah, sure. So, you think this is gonna help, having the stuff around her? Oh, yes. Yes, it's still her. I mean, she'll be tempted to think that her life ended after the attack. Or that that's when it began. But it's not about who she was. It's about who she is. Don't touch anything! It's, er... still a crime scene. - Sorry, yes. - It's OK. Um... it would be really useful to have the... the music, though, the iPod. - Right. - And the collage of the photos as well. Right. How about that one? Who's that? Oh, that's on-off Oliver. He was away on a golf weekend when it happened. We checked. He came to visit. - Do you want that? - Yeah, thanks. Very tidy, isn't she? God, I was such a mess at this age. Scent. Perfume. That would be good. And, um... diaries. Maybe a little cuddly toy. God, they're thin walls, aren't they? Yeah, chewing gum and cardboard. - So, did no one hear anything? - I don't think so. We think she let him in. And he attacked her in here. Saturday night. - Sedated her and then just left her for dead. - Right. Then she comes to 24 hours later and manages to find her way to the Great Eastern. Well, a minor arterial tear can lead to a transient stroke. Before the tear becomes a complete dissection, which would obviously then result in a massive ischaemia, but between the first and the second... Yes, she... she could have staggered to the Great Eastern Hospital. How would she have been, though? I mean, reeling around? Knocking things over? You're right. This place is too tidy. I mean, look at all these flats here facing the road. It's a nice Sunday evening and no one sees anything. A girl in her nightie falling down the street. And why didn't she call out or phone someone? Maybe he drugged her here and took her somewhere else. Then how would she have got to the hospital? I don't know. Alison's belongings, once they've finished in there, I'll bring them over to you. Thanks. Personally? Yeah, yeah. I'm very hands-on. So, Tom, what do you see when you look at Alison? That boy Oliver, he took one look at her and he, you know, hasn't been back since. You've been a few times. Why? What do you see? A witness? Pulled all the hospital CCTV footage. Alison's not there. And there's no sign of her at any of the pedestrian approaches. I hate to admit it but I'm beginning to like your theory. Someone brought her in. They've got ANPR over there. I've got silly bollocks running every plate in and out. You'd better. Without seeming like a tit here, Tom... What? Why try and kill someone and take them to A&E? - Maybe he changed his mind, eh? - We've all been there, haven't we, eh? You wake up Sunday morning, you regret the girl you did the night before. Though normally, I send mine off with the taxi fare home, not a dissected vertebral artery. How many of this lot have got medical expertise? Or the imagination for something like this? There's no sexual element, is there? Ah, now, just because he's not fiddling doesn't mean it's not sexual. ANPR printouts from the hospital. These are the registration plates in and out, 30 minutes either side of when Alison was found. Seen his name, haven't we? Bishop, head of ICU. Yeah, he was the first to treat her. But look at this. That's good work, Dave. Let's go and talk to 'em. Is that your BMW in the car park, Dr Bishop? The car park. Is that your BMW? You mean the BMW that's sitting in my parking space? - Muddy feet on my nice carpet. - Were you driving there last... I'll speak with Orthopaedics myself. What's the extension? Yeah, OK, thank you. Sorry. - Were you driving there last Saturday night? - On Saturday. - On Saturday night? - Yes. Yeah, I was out with some friends so, no, I got a cab, and I think I got in at about 11. What did you do when you got in? You make any calls? No, I try not to call people after 11. Husbands tend to get upset. I don't know, I watched some shitty TV, probably, and tried to get some sleep. - Why? What did you do? - Any shitty TV in particular? Yeah, game shows and soft porn. Is... is he really writing this down? I'm sorry, I'm confused. I thought you were here to talk about Sunday night, when Alison was admitted. I mean, you were on site here when she was found, yeah? Um... yeah. Yeah, fortunately for Alison, I was bleeped half an hour before, so she was lucky. God knows what A&E would have done with her. She came in with a GCS of 3. Pupils were reacting only. So I intubated her, sedated her, took her for a CT, and her brain was just a little tight. So I ordered an MRI and then had her prepped to be sent up to my ICU. Would you like me to slow down? She was lucky, then, wasn't she? I mean that you were here on Sunday night. Do you know, if you need to verify any of this, you can do so with my colleague Dr Coburn. Anne. I think, actually, you... you've met, haven't you? The benzodiazapine that you administered, it was midazolam, wasn't it? Er... yeah, well, that's the way we do it here, Doctor. Works a treat. Can impair memory, if you... She's divorced, actually, you know, Anne. She tell you? No? Her husband left last year. You see, the funny thing is, the hospital has no record of calling you on Sunday night. There's no record of... of a page or... or a bleeper. We're done. Er... you're rude. I was perfectly happy to talk to you about a patient. But now you and my biographer seem to be treating me as if I've got something to hide. - This is a murder investigation, Doctor. - Is it? Oh, Christ. Now just get the fuck off my carpet, would you? - Thanks for your time. - You're welcome. Good luck with the book. Holya Souza. Helen Doyle. Kate, um... Doubleday. Rita Badwage. All under 30, all reported missing since we found Alison Willetts. Girls go missing all the time. Doesn't mean he's got them. No, they don't. You take out the users and the ones with a reason and girls don't go missing. They stay at home. - What, no pain, really? - Just enough. - You up for something yourself? - I don't like pain. It hurts. Are you in any pain? Don't you remember me, Alison? Of course you do. I'm Jeremy. I'm the doctor who treated you when you first arrived. May I touch you? It's all right, Alison. Don't... don't worry. Don't panic. All right, look, it's... it's your decision. But I'd be inclined to close these for her. I don't remember you, Jeremy. I do remember this, though. That's it. This lady potato crashes her moped. The doctor comes up to Miss Potato's boyfriend, the hunky swede. "The good news is she's alive. "The bad news is she's going to be a vegetable for the rest of her life." So, er... what's so special about Alison, do you think? - Here we go. - Come on, humour me. There are signs of struggle on her scans. Some bruising on her lower jaw. - He might have held her down. - Get off. He must have held her for a while if he was gonna bruise her, mustn't he? Maybe. Some bruise easier than others. I, for one, am like a Spanish nectarine. So, could that have happened when he drove her to hospital? Why would he take her to the hospital? I don't know, maybe, you know, she woke up and he just freaked out. Couldn't stand her looking at him. I've been down the Mile End Road, Tom. It goes to Stepney Green, not Damascus. - Come on, let's get one more, yeah? - I'm too tired, I'm too old. And it's never just one more. Oh, come on, you bender. It could be your last night on earth. What are you gonna do, go home to your osteopaedic pillow? Come on. Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, mate! - I'll see you later, yeah? - Yeah. See you. There you go. I'll be right here. I'll be right here for you. It's OK. You're safe now. You're safe now. Night-night, Sleepyhead. Hey. Hey, mister. My name's Angel. You should go home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, OK, yeah. Tell them they'll have to go round. Morning. We've got a witness. Somebody saw him. Just pulled up in a car and dumped her. - Kind of a buzz, isn't it, Dave? - It's a fucking rush, sir. Yeah, they just need a bit more light. She one of your missing? Helen Doyle. This one didn't wake up. You know, for a careful guy, he doesn't mind taking risks. She's only been gone a couple of hours. What's that? Is that where he injected the midazolam? I thought he put it in her drinks. That's where you'd stick a cannula. Would you just keep back there, please? What, for an IV? Helen Doyle. Worked in one of those office buildings on the Westway. Last seen Thursday night at Bar Samba in Chiswick. So, he's had her for two days. It's like you said. He drugs 'em, takes 'em somewhere, plays with them a little while. Then it's the old heave-ho out the car door. - Where's this witness? - He's over here. He's old. Didn't see much. Says he thought the bloke was dumping rubbish. He said he was wearing a baseball cap. Average height, build. Dark car. Says it was nice. Hi. This car, was it nice like... like a Merc or a Rover 75? They all look the same these days. It was dark. I thought he was just chucking rubbish out. At least that's what he said. Right, now, exactly what did he say? "It broke," or... "They keep breaking." - What? - I thought he was chucking an old Hoover. They keep... breaking? Is that it? Alison wasn't a mistake. She was the first one he got right. I like what you've done with the place. They keep breaking. Madeleine, Christine, Susan, Helen. Four dead girls. And you. Why didn't he kill you, eh? Do I look alive to you? I think he brought you here. So why would he do that, eh? I don't know. Your mates, they said, er... they said you lost your coat in the bar, but we found it in your flat. So he... he brought it round, didn't he? Yeah, if you say so. You let him in. Come on, show me, just... Anything, just show me that I'm right. He drugged you with midazolam in whatever drink were sharing, and then he took you somewhere, 24 hours, just you and him. He didn't want to rush you like the others. - He wants to get you right. - Get me right? You're full of sedatives but you must have felt it, eh? - His hands on the back of your neck. - No. Don't do this! Searching till they find what they're looking for. - No! Stop it, Tom! - Arteries on the back of your neck. The blood pumping in your head and then what? I don't remember! This? Nothing? Tom! Tom, what are you doing? You're scaring me! Then he brought you here, and do you know why he did that? Cos you didn't break. You survived. And when he realised that, he had to move fast. He had to get you here. Keep you breathing, because he didn't have all this. You couldn't breathe on your own. So, he had to be quick. What did he do? - He had to stop on the way, didn't he? - Oh, God. Put breath into your lungs. His breath. His mouth on yours, cos he had to keep you alive. That's right. He was desperate for you to survive because you're not a mistake. He wanted you like this. Locked in. He wants you like this. Do you understand me, eh? He wants you like this. Tom, stop this right now. - Pathetic. - Fuck you! She's in distress. This is not the right way to go about this. What do you want from me? I can't remember! He broke another one tonight. Helen. He didn't mean to kill her either, put an IV in her arm. - Alison... - ...Broken, or worse like you! I'm gonna catch him and you've got to remember! You've got to remember! Find a way to tell me! Do you understand? - Stop it! I've tried to! - You've got to find a way to tell me! Tell me! Do you understand? Tell me! Fucking find a way! Tell me! Yes! Yes. I... I did that, didn't I? Thank you. Oh, God. It's an emergency. In there you have absolutely no idea what you're doing! She needs calm. This all takes a lot of patience. You have completely destabilised any progress we've made. What the hell are you doing? Yelling at my patients? I want the name of your superior. - Good luck with that. - I'll make sure you never see Alison again. Oh, why? Cos she's yours, is she? She just communicated with me. She blinked. Isn't that what we want? Isn't that what she needs? She blinked because she was terrified of you. Do you understand? Listen, he wants her like this. He killed another one last night, and it's my job to stop him before he does it again. That allows you to act like a prick, does it? Because what you do is serious. Now, listen, what we do is very serious, and we had to go to university to learn how. Oh, shut up. Prick. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset Alison. - Well, you did. - Yeah, but I didn't mean to. - But you did. We can go on like that for an hour. What do you want? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset her. - OK. - Or you. Especially you. - Me? You didn't upset me. You didn't upset me, cos it kind of worked. She's communicating now. Sort of. - Three blinks for yes. One for no. - That means I can interview her. No. No, no, no, no. It doesn't. Tom, she doesn't remember anything about the attack or the attacker. It's a blank, OK? And I'm glad. I'm glad that it's a blank for her sake. On leaving the train, please remember to take all your belongings with you. What? What else? I'm gonna come right back to you, mate. All right, so we've got him going into the Great Eastern just after three this morning. But he goes out again at 4:15, not 5:30. That gives him an hour and a half to do Helen Doyle and dump her. He's a dodgy bastard. He's got the medical nous. Dr Jeremy Bishop. Do we like him for it? Jeremy? You mean my Jeremy? Oh, come on. I mean, I know he's a wanker and everything, but... Yeah, but not that type of wanker, huh? It's as though he's a walking efit, and he plays the role, doesn't he? Well, it's true he does have to be the centre of attention. Even if that means being a suspect in a murder inquiry? Probably, yes. Um... my scans are down here. So if you just bung the kettle on there. I'm gonna find these images for you. You don't seriously think that Jeremy's responsible, do you? No, I don't. But he is a wanker. Oh, God, Tom, I'm sorry. Do you know what? I didn't get any milk. Um... I've got some wine, though. Oh, you're on duty, aren't you? - No, I'm not on duty. I clocked off hours ago. - Oh, OK. I've got to warn you, though. I do get drunk quickly. Oh, really? I thought policemen were very good at holding their drink and all that. I get drunk quickly but I can keep drinking for hours. Um... so, look, this is it. The functional MRI scan. So, can you see? It captures imaging patterns which correlate specifically to stimuli, thoughts and ideas in the brain. Look, they're here. This particular patient, he was categorised as braindead for 16 years. He was fully conscious and no one even knew it. Sorry. Am I boring you? No. - Don't. - Why? Because my daughter's standing right behind you. - Hello. - Oh, hello. - I'm, um... - Tom. - You were mentioned. - Was I? - You were mentioned. You're, er... - Rachel. This is Rachel, my daughter. Hi. So, er... how long were you planning to stand there? Till the kettle boiled. Well, it's... it's nice to meet you, Rachel. Kevin? - Ma'am? - Just come and have a look at this. Mail room thought it was suspicious. Can you open it for us? "Dear Tom. "Sorry. They're dead, "and it's down to me." I don't understand it. "I never... "wanted to hurt anyone..." ...but they keep... ...Breaking. Could you give us five minutes, Claire? "I feel like you know me. I think about you and it feels special, like a sex thing. "I know about Frank. "I know about all your stories. "I'd like us to be able to talk about it. Can I come and see you, Tom?" - Where's Tom? - He comes and goes. Get off me! Get... It's OK, Tom. It's OK. I'll take care of you. I need you to see, Tom. I need you to see. You know I'm trying to save them, Tom. I only want to save them. Come in, Tom. The water's warm. Maybe they'll see it this time, Mr Thorne. They don't look dead, do they? You're sleepy. You're mine. You're mine. Sleepyhead. They're on their way. Tom! Breathe, Tom! Tom. Breathe! Tom! Where are those fuckin' paramedics?! Can you name the last six prime ministers? Brown, obviously. Blair. Major. Thatcher. Callaghan. And... was it Heath or Wilson? Eh? Heath or Wilson? Heath, right? Come on, Tommy. It was Harold Wilson. 1974 to '76. Lib-Lab pact. And all that. Tom? Tommy? Hey. Hey, you're all right. You're in a hospital. You've been here two days. What's that? He was there, Dad. No, no, no, I can't hear you. Sorry. I couldn't do anything. Couldn't move. Oh, you did everything you could, son. You sent them a text so they knew where to find you. - Did they get him? - Listen, I'm gonna take you home. Your mam'll take care of you. She'll soon sort you out. Tommy, don't try and get up! Don't! Don't! Jesus Christ! Your heart stopped! Sorry, sir. Rest now, please. You let them catch him, eh? You let them do it. Yeah. Dr Strohm wants to see you. Yeah, sure, I'll just scrub up now. "Dear Tom. "Sorry. "They're dead, "and it's down to me. "I don't understand it. I never wanted to hurt anyone. "But they keep breaking. "I feel like you know me. "I think about you and it feels special, "like a sex thing." Tom. - Are you OK? - Yeah. I'm sorry, Tom. He mentions Frank Calvert in the note. Jesus. You don't know about the note, do you? "Dear Tom. "I know about Frank. "I know all your stories. "I'd like us to be able to talk about it. "Can I come and see you, Tom?" Tom, this changes everything. He's hurt one of us. And we're gonna get this fuck. Ringside seat this time. It's great to have you back on board. I'm just getting this lot up to speed. There's four bodies now. He's after Frank's crown. Yeah? How did you work that out? The dead girls are all in white. Well, doesn't that sound like some sort of copycat to you, Tom? Frank Calvert killed six gay guys and his three girls. Whoever wrote that note doesn't want to kill anyone. He wants them alive. Locked in. I tell you what, Kevin, if you want to run with this, that's up to you. Knock yourself out. Yvonne, my office. I want to be brought up to speed on this new profile, all right? Oh, sorry, have I missed something here? You've been out for 36 hours, Tom. Ruth felt that I should... Where are your shoes, Tom? You shouldn't be here, Tom. You can go back to hospital or I'm putting you in a hotel. The Assistant Commissioner wants you looked after. Oh, aye? What do you have in mind, then? Two weeks at Champneys spa or an overnight at the Travelodge? I'm fine. The hospital said you'd be out for two weeks, rest for six. I made Tughan investigating officer. Yeah, temporary. But I'm back now, aren't I? Kevin thought you were followed home from Dr Coburn's house. - He's got Dr Bishop's under surveillance. - Nah. I interviewed Bishop. I can't see it. Well, so did Kevin, yesterday. For a man who wears an expensive watch, he's pretty sketchy on his time. - What have you got on your feet? - Eh? Oh, yeah. I borrowed them. You need a break. You can have a week in my timeshare in Tenerife. Kev isn't getting it. This guy doesn't want to kill. He wants to lock them in. That note as good as said it. I think you're wrong. I'm not alone. He's killed four times. That's what he wants. Dead girls. And you'd be dead too. 2:53am. "Send help." Christ, Tom, if you'd not sent that message, where would you be? I didn't. He did. He had no intention of killing me. - Well, why attack you, then? - I don't know. To show that he could. Oh, you see, this is you, Tom. You get an idea in your head, and everyone else is stupid. I want focused, not fixated. I'm not going anywhere. DI Thorne would like a role in your investigation. How do you feel about that? Well, I can use all the help I can get. Well, you can stay on, but you're taking orders, not giving them. What? Dr Anne Coburn to see you, sir. Is she not dangerous? - So, here you are. - You shouldn't be here. You shouldn't be here. You should be lying in a hospital bed. What is it? Let me see. Look at me. You... look terrible. I'm fine. Wow. Were you robbed as well? Eh? Oh, no, that was always like that. - That's very funny. - No, it's not. You think that's appropriate after what I've been through? It's very inappropriate, and, um... I'm sorry, Tom. I'm gonna go. You need to get some rest. Can I get you anything before I leave? - Do you want a cup of tea? - I want you to stay here. Tonight. Please. OK, yeah. Did I do it wrong? - Action! - OK. It probably looked innocent enough, but perhaps someone saw him talking to her or taking her coat. Alison had been with her friends all evening... She does not look anything like me, does she? I mean, she's at least a ten, and I'm an eight, probably a six by now. Oh, I love that dress. Alison, I'm sorry. That is so insensitive. Shall I turn it off? No. Leave it. We believe she was drunk. I want to know. It was only after Alison returned home - that the assailant came to her door. - I let him in. Stupid bitch. He used the pretext of returning her coat to gain entrance. Tom said he found my coat. The coat was found at her home address. Alison would have been incapacitated by now. It may have looked like she'd been drinking too much and he was assisting her. He touched me, didn't he? Why can't I remember? There is always a sexual element to his attacks. He tends to prey on women in their 20s. In addition to the horrific injuries suffered by Miss Willetts, this man has killed... What is Tughan talking about? There was no indication of anything sexual. - No, it's good. - His last victim was Madeleine Vickery, 24. He's messing with him, trying to get him to justify himself, make a mistake. Jane's doing well. What's with the deep-throat whisper? Oh, I get it. You slapper. You could have been lying dead in that stupid fucking flat. No one would have known about it till the Wine Rack on the corner went out of business. - Yeah, were you worried about me? - Worried about you, Teflon Tom? Murdered Monday, comatose Tuesday, shagging on Wednesday. - I thought I was dead, Phil. - Yeah, I know. And you were worried about me, weren't you? Come on, admit it. Tosser. Bullshit. This man is known to frequent bars where young people gather. God's sake. What are we meant to do, lock them up? A car was seen, a dark saloon car, possibly a BMW. Rachel, was that the girl your mum was treating? Did you see a car fitting this description leaving her building? If anything you've seen tonight jogs your memory... Oh, look at him. He's gorgeous. All calls will be treated with the utmost confidentiality. Here come the crazies. Right, if that guy so much as farts in the bath, we've got him. This man is dangerous and sexually predatory. It hurt... hurts. The pattern of his attacks indicates a man driven by what police psychologists suggest is a desire to hurt and sexually dominate women. It... Leonie, they're lies. This is all lies. I'm trying to save you. Save you. Red. Yes. - I... I love? - What? Hold on, hold on. Yes, "I love." L. Purple. O. Yes. Yellow. N. Lon. I love Lon. Pink. D. Lon. I love London. I love London. What's that? Is that something he said to you? No. - Is it a T-shirt he had on or... - I'd tell you if I knew. I don't remember. I'm herding cats in here. I know it's tough. I know you're scrabbling around for memories. Anything you've got. I'm blinking for wheels here, pal, while you're making doe eyes at Dr Love. I thought she was looking peaky. Alison, you know these words you've told us, these two, are they one word or two, huh? Van. Say. Is it two words or one? - Huh? - I don't know what it means, Tom. - I just heard it. - Is it a name or a place? Alison, come on, van say. You're the detective, Tom. Please work this out. You know this other word you spelt out. Bright. Bright. Was that like a lamp? Was it a window? Huh? Alison, was it like a window in there? - Did you see out of a window? - I can't see him. If you need anything... Heart rate's gone up. Listen, let's give the DynoBox a try. We tried it yesterday. She's not used to it yet, OK? But it reads her eye movements so... ...Let's give it a go. Elephant? Elephants. OK. - You all right, Mr Ramsey? How you keeping? - OK, you know. This place. Drunks and girls with black eyes. Weekends are worse. - I told you I was gonna be sick! - Dr McGann to Obstetrics, please. Dr McGann to Obstetrics, please. - You all right, sir? - Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for coming to pick me up. Thought you'd be busy. - I am. I mean, we are. - What? Mr Tughan was wondering if we could, um... Crimetime, there were 2,000 calls so it's the follow-up. So he was wondering if we could... - Follow them up? - Yeah, yeah. Focus on recent incident dates and geographic reoccurrences. We? What, like you and me? No way. Anyway, I've been poorly. Everyone knows that. Everyone knows you're not gonna stay away. That's why he's putting you on Crimetime. You still think he's trying to keep the girls alive, don't you? Worked on Alison, didn't it? He's not gonna stop now. Question is, when did it start? There must have been a time before. I mean before Alison, before Christine, before Madeleine even. Sir? Yeah, OK, Crimetime. We can follow it up. We, sir? What, are we like BFFs now? First you're wearing my Puma Sky II Hi Tops and... Shut up, you wanker. Hey, you won't be laughing when I sell your trainers on eBay, will you? Thanks, Tom, really. I'm gonna need you. No problem. You looked taller on the telly. So did something in the Crimetime programme jog your memory, Miss Byrne? I mean, this happened to you over a year ago. How come you didn't go to the police then? I thought it was a dream. I'm into dreams. I keep a dream diary. Right. So, you wrote it down, then? No. Funny, that. I know it was November. They'd just opened the Starbucks opposite the tube. They sell off their sandwiches half price at the end of the day. I thought I had too much coffee cos I came over funny. Then I was at my own front door, just like in a dream. There and then here. Yeah, and that was that. Nice. Well, thank you, Maggie, you've been really... He must have followed me, because suddenly someone was helping me in the door. I was out on the street. - Yeah? - He had my keys. I suppose I fell. And I was on the floor. But I couldn't feel the tiles cos I was lying on a thing, like plastic. And I was being sick. But I thought, "That's all right, cos there's a plastic sheet." It was a dream, wasn't it? Next thing I know, Pascal was licking my face. Pascal? Maggie, listen to me. Listen. - Maggie, can you hear me? - Maggie, stay with me. - What can you see? It's just a dream. - I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm trying to save you. - Can you see him? - No, I can't see him. - Why can't you see him, Maggie? - He could have hurt me but he didn't. He brought me back to life. - He so sweet. He's talking to me. - Maggie. Crying. Telling me he's scared. - Maggie, can you hear me? - All he wanted was to help me. - It will be over soon. - Try to remember. Did you see anything? Did you see him? Did you see him? No. I don't like this. You're playing with me. - It's all right, Maggie. - It was a dream. I want you to go now. Did he take anything? I mean, is anything missing? No. I'd have known. I mean, if something was missing, I'd have known it wasn't a dream, wouldn't I, dummy? I gave him a gift. In the dream, I mean. He was so upset and worried about stuff. He was ever so grateful in the dream. So, I told him this is what I do when I was worried. I tell my worries to my worry dolls, you know. Perfect little things. Here we are. It wasn't a dream, was it? We should get them together. Get Maggie down to the Great Eastern. Anne said parallel association can sometimes prompt memory so if we get Maggie talking, it might trigger something in Alison. All right, so I'll type it up and tell the guv... guv. I'll just... I'll call it in, whatever. You arrested someone who was halfway round the world when these killings began. - Is that a feeling you want to get used to? - It proves what you've been saying. We wait, understand? Keep it to ourselves until we know what this is. Get Maggie down to the hospital. Yes, sir. Holland. He's gone down-market this time, sir. Needle tracks. We're thinking prostitute. My Crimetime broadcast is really working. We're squeezing him. He's a celebrity now. He can't cruise the fancy bars any more. A dead homeless teenager and that's actioned progress, is it? If he kerb-crawled her, chances are Vice'll have it on file. And the other punters must have seen something. A car, a BMW perchance. Have you enough to pick Bishop up? Forty grand a day, that's what this is costing. They want an arrest for the money. You need to make choices, Kevin. Pick him up or pick on someone else. Great. Dead girls in white gowns. Remind you of anything, Phil? Cos I've got a long memory. You two and your secrets. I told you, I've got a nose for these things. What's that? - It's an ECG pad. - So, he's had her on a heart monitor? IV units, infusion pumps, cardiac monitors. This guy's got a regular ICU somewhere. Listen, you... you call me as soon as you've done the initial, yeah? Shouldn't I be calling Kevin? Well, he's the boss now, isn't he? I'll see you up there. What if he finds out? Look, I'm not talking about a poxy postmortem. He's taken my Calvert files. He thinks it's a copycat, OK? He's wrong. Well, you just keep your head down. Cos if this guy doesn't get you, Tughan might. Tom Thorne. - A name I always liked. - Gina, you're looking good. - Aren't you going to buy me a drink? - You're joking, aren't you? By the looks of things, you can buy me one. You haven't come here to make trouble, Tom, have you? Leonie Holden. She's 18 years old. - Not one of mine. - She's dead. Found her body washed up yesterday. The guy you've been reading about, she's his fifth. There are a lot of pretty girls out there and sometimes they become dead girls. No, I need your help on this, Gina. Just ask around for me. Take me to where these girls work. I can't go to Vice on this one. I don't know any of the new faces, do I? Please come with me. But that's not what I mean. Why are they putting you with him? Sophie, we're following leads. Crimetime comes out with like 600 people. Nobody trusts Tom Thorne. Your dad said he was a drunk. My dad? My dad sat behind a desk for 25 years looking for three stripes. Now he talks like he's fucking RoboCop. I know what I'm doing. Really, Dave? You've got onion on your hand and you're wiping your eyes. Why do you think Tughan put you with him? He could have had me watching CCTV. He assigned me to Thorne. This is how you repay him? By keeping secrets? Now, I hope you're a better cop than you are a cook, David Spencer Holland. If you need me I'll be in my boudoir, peeing like a racehorse. Hey, Mr Tughan, it's Dave. I need... Dave Holland. I need to talk to you so I was wondering if we can meet. I just want to go over something we found today. Er... yeah, Thorne found. It's just one of the Crimetime follow-ups. I think it's significant. I didn't really feel comfortable... I'm sorry to trouble you so late, Mrs Calvert. I don't normally let people into my house. They get too much of a kick out of it. I'm not here for kicks. I need to talk to you about your ex-husband. The man attacking these women, he wrote us a note, and it mentions Frank. I tried to warn you all way before. I screamed and shouted. That's all I was, right? A screamy alky bitch. If you'd got in there then, you could have stopped him killing my girls. I'm sorry. We made mistakes. That's why I'm here. I'm sorry to hear about James. But I really need see his personal effects. There's not much left of my son. James killed himself, Mr Tughan. Let's not mealy-mouth here. He put himself under a train. I buried a coffin full of mush. If you lot had listened to me... I told you Frank was abusing our son, but you weren't interested. If you'd got him then... Christ! Did something happen to James... ...towards the end? Was there any new friends? Anyone take an unnatural interest in him? He was hanging out with all sorts, the last few years. They loved having a bit of Frank Calvert's son. I told him I didn't want to see him. I didn't even give him my new address. This man, Jeremy Bishop, was he a friend of James from back then? - I don't know. - Think about it. Think about it? Back then? You think I ever think about anything else? OK, Teresa. So, er... how many girls have you brought here, then? Oh, not many. Not many women pass the Gary Grill test. Where's Rachel tonight? She's with her dad. He's probably talking to her about Kasabian and, um... contraception. She seems great. She's a nightmare. She terrifies me. She just... she's got so much hope, you know? How about you? No kids? Did you ever come close? - I don't know. Maybe. - OK. Well, which? You don't know, or maybe? Once nearly. I was seeing this girl and she wanted to, but I was working this case and some kids died. After that, you know. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, shit. Listen, I'm sorry, I need to get this. Hello. Yeah? Look, Chloe, my mum said no bars. You're not at a bar, Rachel. You're at your dad's, all right? That, my friend, is the up side to divorce. OK, ladies, come through. How you doing, all right? Sorry, come back after the Olympics, love. - Rache, wait there! - Let's go. I'm sorry. Tughan, he's over my shoulder the whole time. Look, he's shitting himself. He wanted this case. Now he's got to deliver. Ah, he knows something. Never trusted him. Never. I'm a triple threat, pathologist, poof, pal of yours. - What have you found? - Not a lot. She had high levels of oxygen in her blood so she might have been hooked up to a mast. There were some PM10s in her lungs. You know, some other trace element. Zinc oxide, copper. They reckon she worked out east so that's no surprise. The whole place is a construction site right now. Helen Doyle lived the other side of town too. Picked up the exact same thing, only much lower concentration. Her exposure was recent and brief. - He's taking 'em east. - Thanks very much. What, is that it? Are you just gonna leave me here drinking on my own? What's the matter, Phil? This all getting to you? Cos it's getting to me, you know. Why is Tughan so interested in Calvert? Are you not just the tiniest bit worried about it? Cos I am. We survived that, remember? - Huh? - Yeah. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if he found out. Cos it stains us. We'll just get this guy and then we'll talk about it, yeah? Phil. Phil! Just forget about it, yeah? Cos I'm fucking tired! Let's get out of here, yeah? Come on, we'll talk about it. Phil! Was he gay? Frank? I always thought that was the real reason he killed homosexuals. You think he was that picky? That man obliterated everything. He'd have cut the sun out of the sky if he could. Frank told James he'd kill anyone who betrayed his secrets. Now they're all dead or forgotten. But not Frank Calvert. He'll never be gone. I want you to leave now. Don't I know you? OK. Her name's Leonie. She worked around here. She's 18. This way. Oh, it's all right. You told us your story before. You can tell us again. Hi. You must be Maggie. My name's Anne Coburn. I'm Alison's doctor. I... I told her to expect you. Hey, Maggie. You've got to do this. Don't be scared of the freak. Her name's Leonie Holden. That's her real name. - No. - No, I don't. - Do you think she worked round here? - Maybe a few nights ago. - Do you know where she lives? - Yeah, it's a squat in Cranmer Street. That's great. Thanks for your time. She was here two nights ago. She didn't get any business and she went home. The girl says it was a squat in Cranmer Street. That must be what dying feels like. It wasn't bad, like when you're in a bath and you sink your head back in the water. It's in between this and that. Is that how it felt for you? How it felt? I don't know. I can't feel a thing. They're the last feelings I'll ever have and I can't bloody remember! He's going to save me. He's talking to me, like a rhyme. Same thing over and over, like something you say to a kid. Her squat's got to be around here someplace. He must have picked her up on her walk home. Avancez! Avancez! Avancez! Van Say? Was it one word or two words? Was it his name? Avancez! Avancez! Avancez! Avancez! Avancez! Avancez! Avancez! - Avancez! - Let's go round the back. You should go. Avancez! Avancez! Avancez! Listen, you'd better go. Go on now, go on. Shit. Avancez! They don't look dead, do they? - Tom! - Gina! He... he's here! Hey! - How long have you been there, then? - Too long. Avancez! Avancez! Avancez! Oh, you look gorgeous. Avancez! Avancez! We'll get prints, we'll get DNA and we'll have him in 24 hours. - Where's Gina? - The hooker? She's in A&E. Kitson's taking her statement. You can always question Margaret Byrne again, the second survivor. She's there with Alison Willetts. Tom and Dave found her from Crimetime responses. - Well, it's nice of you to join us. - Sorry, ma'am. I wasn't warned. I was at the archives in Ealing. If Thorne had told me what he was doing, if he'd bothered to tell his IO the little things like witnesses, evidence... Tom found this on his own. You've got 40 detectives working shifts. Take this and use it, but don't blame the man for finding something you couldn't. No, no! Get off of me! Leave me alone! No! Leave me alone! - Ma'am? - Ma'am's gone. Talk to Pops. - I'm sorry about before. I didn't... - Oh, Maggie, she can't see you there. If you stand here in front of her. Jesus. Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude or unkind. I just wasn't expecting... you. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm OK. I just need to get some air. - I need to go down to X-ray to intubate. - Mary, could you go up to Neurology? Could we have a duty cleaner to reception, please? A duty cleaner to reception. He's coming down in the lift. Security to Triage, please. Security to Triage. Can you stay with me? Somebody get the medics! I need some help now! Someone get me a doctor! I've got severe lacerations to the neck! Someone get me a fucking medic! - Maggie! Maggie, squeeze my hand! - Doctor, quickly! Stay with me, Maggie! Ready? Now I'm going to sit you up. One, two, three, go! Cover it! I found her through there! Through there! I found her there in the toilet! - In the toilet! - You're gonna be all right! Two doctors, please! This is an emergency! She's lost a lot of blood! Night-night. Sleepyhead. Tom. Tom. Come here. No, no, no, come here. Keep the pressure on. Where's the fucking doctor? Let's get out of here. Come on. Holland's got it. Holland's dealing with this. Go on. Keep relaxing. One, two, three. All right, go, go, go. Go. - Let's sit down. Sit down. - Hold her arm. Cover it. Tom, I know what you're thinking. This has nothing to do with you. It's not your fault, OK? - Tom, look at me. Talk to me. - You don't understand. I know who did this. The Great Eastern hospital... ...the assault and subsequent death of Miss Maggie Byrne. All officers report to... They said her name. They just said "Maggie". - Alison, it's OK. It's all over. - No. - You're safe. - He was here, you dopey twat. He's killed that poor girl, hasn't he? She wasn't much older than me and she smelled like my gran. It's OK, Ali. You're safe. Fuck "Ali". Ali's a trippy-dippy bohemian bitch, lives in Muswell Hill with her boyfriend who works for Friends of the fucking Earth. I am no Ali. I was never an Ali. And I am never getting out of here. Er, Miss Calvert? Mr Thorne. Tom, isn't it? Sorry, your erm... Your door was open. I just wanted a chat. Be down in a second. Actually, you haven't met my little angels, have you? Come on up. Come on. They're just having a nap. Ringside seat, Mr Thorne. Tom. So this is what they've done with the place, eh? I had a hope for a... adventure playground. Or at least a garden of contemplation. So, what did you want me here for, Tom? A sigh for old times? - OK. There's Maggie Byrne. - Ah. OK? And there she is, going into the toilets. - I need to talk to you, ma'am. - Talk fast. I know who's doing this. I've heard that before. OK, pause it. We found these photographs in the room where the girls were killed. Oh, Jesus. I got another note. This one written in a dead woman's blood. More personal than a text message, I suppose. "How did you feel, Tom, when you killed him?" No one else knew, Phil. Only you. Jesus. It's going to be OK. No one's heard. I'm glad you called me. We may not have much time. - I've been trying to call you all morning. - I'm not taking calls off you any more. I don't want the privilege of your information. I never told anyone what you did. But maybe I should have done. Cos maybe then I wouldn't be like this. I understand, Phil. You know, seeing those girls... Yeah, you saw them once. Once. I had them laid out three days, side by side in that mortuary. I don't do dead kids any more, Tom. And the men that Calvert killed. They were men like you, weren't they? Going to the same bars, the same clubs as you. I can understand, Phil, you know. What do you understand? "How did it feel, Tom, when you killed him?" Come on. Just get in. You were the only one who knew! OK, you know what to say. Yeah? DC Thorne here. I'm outside the house of a suspect. Yeah, we interviewed him yesterday but I'm here for the follow-up and the door's open. I don't like it. Could you send back-up? Soon as you can, yeah? I'm gonna go in now. You wanted to talk about it and I never would and I'm sorry about that, but Phil, just tell me, come on. Tell me. You killed Maggie. Tell me. You killed them all, didn't you? The profiler thinks this guy's impotent or sexually confused. Phil Hendricks never seemed confused about his sexuality to me. He fits the Calvert connection! He was there. Calvert was killing gay men. This could be some sort of queer revenge. "He fits the Calvert connection"? He was the attending pathologist. What the fuck are you going back there for? Tell her, Dave. Tell her what you saw. It's all a bit fuzzy. Erm... Just fucking tell her what you found on the fuck... Just tell her what was written in blood on the toilet wall where you found Margaret Byrne. "How did you feel, Tom, when you killed him?" - Phil, just say it! - Get up! Say it, Phil. Just tell me. Fuck! Thorne killed Calvert. And Hendricks covered up for him. He made it look like suicide. Hendricks killed those girls. He killed Margaret Byrne. He wrote those words, in her blood, on the wall and then Thorne wiped them away. That's two cases solved for the price of one. That should appeal to your bottom line. I want proof. Phil Hendricks' DNA on these girls, these girls' DNA on Phil Hendricks. Oh, I'll get Hendricks. For the girls. And for covering Calvert up. And then we're going after Tom Thorne. Yeah, you're right. It did fuck me up. I met him, you know. James Calvert. I never told him who I was. Most of the time, he was surrounded by all these freaks. And ghouls. All feeding off the thrill. You shouldn't have done it, Tom. You shouldn't have killed him. Frank fucking Calvert. I shouldn't have lied for you. Cos then he wouldn't be a ghost, would he? He'd just be some sad ponce sitting in a prison cell. Cos the living can't haunt you. Frank Calvert destroyed everything... and everyone... he came into contact with. But it was only after I met his son... I realised that you really, really destroy someone. You make them live with something that they can't possibly live with. And that's what he did to us. If it's not you, Phil, who is it? Hey? Help me here. I'm sorry, just... Who can it be? Who is it? So I tried to call you a few times, but... you weren't picking up and I... got... I killed someone. 15 years ago. Put a gun to his head and I shot him. The only reason I'm telling you now is because other people know. Whoever's killing these girls... he knows. - Well... Sorry, why? - Because he deserved it. I can't remember. Remember when she was in Friends and every girl in the world wanted to look like her? Sheila came by last week. She told me they were gonna postpone their wedding until I'm better. ...Rachel haircut but my mum wouldn't let me. She had this voice on her. They all have that voice. Like Dad, when he calls and says they've got my room ready in Californialand. And then Rachel... I'm beginning to recognise that sound. - They were supposed to... - The sound of a lie. It's easier with strangers. Well, they never knew you before. Was it a good relationship? You and Ollie. I suppose not. I mean, you were out on the pull that night. Why? I forgot. Not that kind of girl. Do you wish you hadn't asked him to stay away? D'you want me to ask him back? Is there... one... like... someone you think about? Jennifer Aniston must have thought that when she met Brad. And Vince. And Gerard. And... That's my bracelet. Oh, my God. That's... That's my bracelet. Why have you got my bracelet? - Who's that? - We're having a good conversation, me and Alison. About boys. - About you. - No! No, stay away from him! - Are you OK, Alison? - No, Rachel, listen to me. - What's wrong? What are you looking at? - No. - She's looking at you. - No, you keep him away from me! Keep him away from me! - I see you. What's the matter? - Oh, God! We need to... get somebody. - Rachel! Leave me alone! Christ! - No. - No! Don't! - I'm going to save you. Hold still. It's him! I remember now cos he was at the bar. I saw him. And then he came to my door. He had my coat. I was happy. I was happy to see him. We talked. Why did I talk to him? Oh, you let him in. You stupid bitch, you let him in. You trusted him. She trusted him. She knows him. He gave her my bracelet! We were having a drink. Oh, my God. Rachel! And his hands... on me. He's got her now. Feel it, Alison. Remember. So they can stop him. Feel it. Feel it. It's the only way they'll hear you. Come on, Alison. I remember now. His hands around my neck. Talk to me. Talk to me. Look at me. 190 over 105. I remember him now. You have to listen. You have to help her. ...No. Tom. Sleep now, Alison. You sleep. Fella goes to work on a building site. Foreman asks him, "Can you make tea?" Guy says, "Yeah." Foreman asks, "Can you operate a fork-lift truck?" - The guy says... - "How big's this fucking teapot?" Yeah, that's it. You know all my jokes now. Dad, I... What is it? It's normally me who calls you first thing in t'morning. Er, no, it's nothing. It's just erm... Just fancied a chat, that's all. - Another time, yeah? - Tom. It's Rachel. I just called her dad. She's not with him. She texted him to say that she was with me. She was at the hospital last night with Alison, - but no one's seen her since. - We'll find her. - No, Tom... - What? Hey. There was this boy! She's been seeing this boy and I... I keep trying to ring her but she's not answering! It's all right. Come on, we'll find her. We'll find her. Come on. Alison. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Alison? Tom, they've sedated her. Seven milligrams of ventanol and 50 of propyrol. 8:15 last night, her blood pressure was off the chart. - Rachel had already gone. - Alison, come on! - She won't be able to respond! - She is responding. Alison, can you hear me? Alison, come on. She's responding. Alison. Tom! Oh, my God, this is Rachel's. It's broken. It's her bracelet. The one the boy gave her. Alison. Alison. Rachel was here last night, wasn't she? Was she with a man? Was a man with her last night? Alison, did he hurt her? Was it the same man that attacked you? Tom... What the fuck? Why are there policemen standing outside? How could he get in here? - Call me when you get this, will you? - Tom, answer me! This should never have happened! Is that the incident room? It's er... It's DI Thorne here. I'm trying to get in touch with DI Tughan. Rachel Coburn was abducted last night from the Great Eastern. - Slowly, slowly, slowly. - She's 15 years old. About 8pm, we think. Just give the message to him, will you? I need your help, Alison, OK? Alison, go slower. It's not making any sense. What's that? "Night," yeah? Last night she was here, yeah? Come on, Alison. What's his name? "Night-night," yeah? What the fuck...? It doesn't say anything. Why...? - "Night-night, sleepyhead"? - What? - Is that what he said to you? - Tom, what's that? "Night-night, sleepyhead"? No, Alison, it's not possible cos it can't be him. No one knows that. Did he wash you, dress you in white and say, "Night-night, sleepyhead"? It's easy. Much easier than you think. No, it can't be, Alison, because he's dead. I killed him! You... Fuck! Tom! What is it? What is...? Alison, please, you have... So, what have you got? Have you found him? There he is. Where does that corridor go? Forward it. - There he is. - Where's he gonna go from there? - There he is. Where's that? - It's a service lift. Right, I want every exit from the service lifts, 20:04 onwards. OK? - Where is he? - I checked 'em all. There's no sign of him. He must have gone to the basement. We don't use it. There's no cameras down there. I came home yesterday. Then I knew you'd seen it. I could tell by the look in your eyes. I could not have them knowing. They wouldn't have understood. My angels. They don't look dead, do they? I thought you'd be quicker. I thought you would stop me. I had all the time in the world. They're at peace, Tom. And as they went, I whispered to them... like I always do. "Night-night... sleepyhead." Can you open the door? Anne. Where's Rachel? Who's that? Look! Look! You know, I've been answering your questions all fucking night. I'm just asking you one. Why have you got that picture on your wall? - We'll sort it out later, mate. - Him! That picture. Rachel? Rachel! Rachel. Rachel! Can you hear me? James Calvert. Come on! Ra... Rachel, come on! James Calvert is dead. Rachel! Speak to me, Rachel. Exactly. So how come he's on your fucking witness board? I couldn't save her. Go on! I couldn't save her. - That's Josh Ramsey. - That is James Calvert. Finally. I couldn't save her. I couldn't save her like I saved Alison. I couldn't do it. She... She was lying there... All I wanted was to save them from what he did to us... to me, to my sisters. Anne-Marie, Samantha, Lauren. Course you did, James. And was there anyone else you were trying to save? Josh Ramsey. Canadian tourist. Last seen the 16th of October on CCTV, Tooting High Street. That's the day before James Calvert was apparently found under a train 100 yards away. So, after Frank Calvert topped himself, James was sent to Canada to live with his aunt for four years. He and Josh became friends there. Josh Ramsey. Tell me about him. - Did you try to save him? - I thought Josh was my friend. And he tried to touch me. So you killed him. And you took his identity. I thought that I could start again. And then I'd see someone... and they'd remind me of my sisters. A... A softness. And the way they would look at me. And I... I knew that I had to save them. I tried to explain it. I wrote to you. I knew... I knew Tom would understand. After all, he... After all what? James? Tell me about Tom. James. - Tell me about Tom. - Tom saved me! He saved me... What? James. I'm sorry. James, I'm sorry, I interrupted. You said Tom saved you. How did he save you? I used to follow Dad when he came to get my sisters. He... never took me. Not after I told on him. And I'd watch them. Not spying. I wanted to make sure that they were safe. That... That... That he wasn't doing that stuff to them like he did to me. But they never came out, not that day. It was so quiet. And then Dad came to the door and he... He knew that I was there, but he wasn't angry. He smiled... at me. Asked if wanted... if I wanted to come in to... to... to make up. It's OK, James. Don't you wanna join us? Your sisters are asking for ya. Come on. Come in. And you believed him. We believed him. He told me to call them. Give them a shout, James. They're... lying down. - Lauren? - Lauren? - Samantha? - Samantha? - Anne-Marie? - Anne-Marie? I thought they were sleeping, so I tiptoed in cos I didn't wanna wake them and I didn't wanna make Dad angry. I went with him. He... He took me into my sisters' room. And he laid me on the bed and he told me that it'd just be like old times before my sisters, before my mum stopped him seeing me. That's right... son. Just you and me. Like it was before. And he picked up the pillow and I could... I could see the gun. There was a gun? James, are you sure Frank had a gun? He asked me if I remembered what he used to say to me when he put me to bed. You remember, Jamie? "Night-night." Night... night. - Er, Mr Calvert? - I could hear someone coming in the door. Thorne, isn't it? Then I could hear him speaking to Tom. So he was alive? James, answer me. - This is important. - He saved me, you see, from him. So your father... was alive when Thorne arrived in the house. Is that right, James? - Is that right, James? - You don't understand. He saved me. What does that mean? Tell me what happened. Did he shoot him? Tell me, James. What are you seeing? Did he shoot him? What did he do? Tell me what you're seeing! Tom. Just tell me... James. Tell me what Tom did. You hate him, don't you? Just tell me what Thorne did... to your father. He... saved... You fucking shady little bastard! Don't you fuck with me! Don't you waste my fucking time, you fucking nonce! Fuck! Why protect him? If you tell them what he did, what you saw... a 12-year-old boy - then they'll take pity on you. You didn't stand a chance. You had a father like that. Then your sisters. And then to see that and to know that the man responsible for that was a police officer! I just wanna make things right! It's not too late... James. Because he wears the same badge I do. Talk to me, James. Talk to me. Talk to me. James. Talk to me. James. Someone get a medic! He's bit off his fucking tongue! Get a medic! There was one... once. We were on a training day. He was in my group. He poured tea for everybody... but he smiled at me. And I wanted to smile back. He smiled and... I didn't. And now... now I'll never make love under the stars. I'll never... run down a grassy hill or swim with the fucking dolphins. You don't live like that just in case you die tomorrow. We did need each other, didn't we, Tom? You were the only one who didn't pity me. You understood. And... I gave you something to care about. Oh, at least for a while. Cos... I'm not that special, am I? My father came yesterday. All the way from Palm Springs with the new teeth... and the new wife. You say "tomayto", I say... Well, I didn't say very much, actually... because it was you I needed to talk to. And... now that we've talked, I think I understand what happened. I never... skipped through the flowers. I didn't even go to the gym much. I just... made up the numbers. That was my life. And... it was OK. But this... isn't my life. So, Alison... you're sure this is what you want? Night-night, sleepyhead.
