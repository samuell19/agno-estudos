(mysterious music) (crowd grumbling) [Judge] I said, order. (gavel banging) I said, quiet. Order in here or I will clean the whole damn room of every one of you. Coleman William Dobbs, stand up. Dobbs, you have been found guilty in the manslaughter deaths of Elizabeth Margaret Brecman, age 23, and Amanda Florence Brecman, age 17 months. Since the law does not allow your miserable carcass to be hung by the neck until you are dead, I sentence you to seven years hard labor at the territorial prison in Yuma. And it is my personal hope that you rot for the heinous crimes that you have committed. [Coleman] I didn't do this. You're sending me away for something I didn't do. I'll return the favor, you meater. You can feel certain of that. I'll see you again! (deep daunting music) You quim. I'll see you too. (slow foreboding strings music) (gentle sorrowful strings music) Ma'am, I wonder if'n I may borrow a moment of your time? Why, sure, sheriff. May I come inside? All right. (deep haunting music) [Sheriff] Hello there. What can I do for you, sheriff? Well, it's about Dobbs. Is he around? Coleman? Coleman, isn't here. He hasn't been here a spell, in fact. Well, is that so? When's the last time you seen him? Eight, maybe 10 days ago. Well, that makes sense. Seems a coach from Cottonwood was robbed about eight to 10 days ago. [Margaret] Sheriff, I don't understand. What don't you understand, Margaret? Stagecoach was robbed eight or 10 days ago? You know it was robbed, but you can't remember which day? And what does that have to do with Coleman? It doesn't matter what you think. It doesn't matter what day it was. What matter is, Dobbs did it, and he did it without my permission. (deep suspenseful music) You know, why don't I just take my cut from you? I hope you like it. Not in front of the baby. Come on! (gentle somber music) (scary music) Well, look who decided to come outta hiding. I ought a shoot you down right where you stand. Where's my money? I told you I wouldn't do it, Smitty. I left that life behind in California. I, I remember California. You had no problem robbin' and thievin' back then. Now you come out to new territory and take on sainthood? I ain't buying it. We partnered a long time ago. I thought you went straight, being a sheriff and all. Why couldn't I go straight too? You know that saying about old dogs and new tricks? I know you robbed that stagecoach, and I want my cut, and I want it now. If I had it, I'd give it to you. - Coleman! Margaret? (tense music) (dramatic bang) No. What did you do? What did you do? It ain't what I did, honey. It what I'm about to do to you. (Margaret grunts) (slow haunting music) (music intensifies) (deep suspenseful music) (glass shatters) (deep tense music) (music intensifies) (gentle somber strings music) When I got there, I found Dobbs, drunker than Cooter Brown. He was passed out in front of the house. (sighs) That house was up in flames, Miss Brecman still inside, and that, that young in still inside. (sheriff sighs) [Judge] Mighty serious. I'm pretty sure it was an accident. I don't see anyone in their right mind doing something so evil, him being drunk and all. (deep somber music) [Judge] I shall take take your thoughts under advisement. Thank you, Judge Bassett. One more thing. After this here trial's over, I'm tendering my resignation. I'm gonna go try my luck in the goldfields in Alaska. I heard a man can make a killing. Well, with gold. (gentle somber strings music) (somber classic Western music) (gentle somber music) Howdy stranger. What can I do for you? By the day, the week, or the month? Just water and some oats. Still gotta charge you for a day. That'll be two bits. Say, you know anything about the sheriff? Sure, I've known Sheriff Tackett for a while now. Tackett? The sheriff's name is Tackett? [Horse Keeper] Yes, sir. What happened to Smith? [Horse Keeper] Smith? Smith, he was a big guy. He was, he was here before I, he was here last time I was in these parts. Now I remember, big guy, Sheriff Smith. He was in office less than a, a year, if I'm remembering rightly. He left camp and went up to Alaska looking for gold. He, he didn't make it. Alaska? What do you mean, didn't make it? Well, just like I said, son, he got as far as Barkerville up there in Canada. It was one of those saloons and he got in a bar fight with the wrong guy, stuck a knife in his belly. One of those mounted police fellas sent his belongings down here, hopin' he had some kin. But he didn't, not around here anyway. Nothing worth anything, a picture of his ma and sister, and a couple of coins, a rusty gun, from snow and ice, I suppose. And you're sure of this? Saw it with my own two eyes. I was with old Percy over at telegraph station when the package was delivered and opened. I guess so then. What's this for, mister? For the information. Well, thank you. For keeping tight-lipped about telling me of it. That's saloon over there still serving rot gut? No, sir. That saloon, now, that's a fine, upstanding place. All pretty and spiffy inside. I think you'll like it. Hey mister, I'll take real good care of your horse, real good care. Come on boy. (upbeat swing music) (footsteps click slowly) Afternoon. Your poison? What're my choices? Well, there's whiskey, whiskey, might have some whiskey in the back. You're a funny man. I do what I can. Just passing through or fixin' to stay? That matter to you? No, I get paid either way. Five cents. (whiskey dribbling) Truth is I don't know. May leave, may stay. Depending on? Is that any of your business? Not at all. Unless you make it my business, I reckon. Looking for something in particular? Someone maybe? You know, you ask a lotta questions for a tapster. Well, could be I might lead you in the right direction. Lookin' for some gambling? Could lead you in that direction. Could tell where the straight tables are. Soft company? Opium? What about people? See, I was looking for a certain person. Maybe I could help with that also. Even if that person was a judge? I can't help with that. Can't help? Why don't I believe that? I don't know. I guess it's on you, stranger. (tense suspenseful music) [Grace] Hold on there, Catherine, I want a word with you. What, Grace? What is it? I don't like the way you seem to be showing interest in Thaddeus. What are you going on about now? I saw the way you were looking at him at last night's social. What are you talking about? I have zero interest in Thaddeus. Oh, really? Then explain to me... I do not feel the need to explain anything to you. Now, get away from me. You stay away from him. I'm warning ya, or else. Or else what, Grace? Or, or else... (Cathryn chuckles) That's what I thought. Or else this. (hand slaps) (Cathryn gasps) Why, you little... (Grace and Cathryn yelling) Uh, Ladies. Uh, hold on. Ladies, what the Sam Hill's goin' on here? Break this up, girls. Wait till my daddy hears about this. - Break this up. Just break this... That's enough. Hold on. Now, ladies, what started all this? Oh, I can tell you what happened. - She was looking at Thaddeus. - She came up... - Well we ain't gettin' nowhere here. - Outta nowhere. That's enough. Miss Cathryn, you get on home. Miss Grace, you come with me. (gentle music) What was that all about? Oh, just a cat fight over a fella, I'd guess. That one over yonder, that Cathryn Bassett, that's the judge's spoiled-brat kid. Judge's kid? Bassett, Judge Clarence Bassett? Yeah, that's him. Spoils that girl to no end. You know him? I've heard the name. Like I was saying, the other girl, the one the sheriff's takin' away, I ain't too sure, Grace somethin' or other, I think. My money says brat Bassett was making eyes at the other girl's, beau, and the other girl done had enough of it. She seems to catch the eye of most of the young men around here, but her daddy seems to run 'em off if they try to know her more, if you get my meaning. Is that so? Ah, it's the rumor at least. The old judge probably threatens the family or some other thing and the boy stays away. So she doesn't have a steady? Why? You interested in her? Darling, I got what you need in here. And they'd be a lot less of a challenge. Maybe even better for your health. I enjoy the challenge. Where you going? I was just gonna go take some air. I know where that air leads you. Listen, I know you're sweet on him. And if he wasn't always a threat to shut me down, I'd tell you to stay the hell put. Well, Bud needs to know about Cathryn. Don't you be gone long, and I mean that. I won't. Say, you all right, miss? I'm fine. Well, that was a pretty good shot she gave you. (scoffs) I said I'm fine. Well, I was just checking in. It looked to me like she got the best of you. Excuse me. What did you just say? Just that she got in some good shots. It seems to me she won. I beg your pardon, that little tramp did not win. There was certainly nothing for her to win. Okay, okay. I was just concerned for you. Well, I definitely don't need your concern, sir. Okay, fine. Now where we going? I am attempting to go home. I don't know, nor do I care, where you were going. Well, I'm attempting to follow you, just to make sure you're okay. Okay? Trying to keep me safe. From what? From strange young men, perhaps. If that's the objective, you're failing miserably. Well, I could try harder. What do you want? Do I need to summon the sheriff? Or my daddy, perhaps? Do you know who my daddy is? You have no idea who I am, do you? Well, seems the sheriff has his hands full with your adversary right now, and no, I don't know who you are, but I'd like to. What I do know is you have a wicked left hook. Maybe I should call you Lefty. Do you always act this bold with strange girls? No, you don't seem so strange to me. And only when it works. Is it working? Maybe, but a gentlemen would introduce himself. Oh. Miss, my name is Dobbs, and you are? Cathryn, Miss Cathryn Bassett. Just Dobbs? Miss Cathryn, it is my very great pleasure. Wonder if I may be so bold as to invite you to have a glass of tea with me? Oh, I must look a mess. Perhaps another time? Oh, but of course, yes. Tomorrow. Oh, Mr. Dobbs, you're so persistent. Only when persistence is the best option. Say, would you be able to recommend a suitable establishment where I could procure a fine supper? Oh um, well yes. The cafe has the best food in town. I'm slightly embarrassed to admit, I do, shall we say, help out there on occasion. But, my daddy says that I'll learn the value of a dollar that way. The food is quite tasty though. Excellent. Tomorrow at the cafe for dinner it is. Shall we say six? No, we won't, I did not say that I would attend supper with you, Mr. Dobbs. But you did not say that you wouldn't. Would you do me this honor, Miss Cathryn? I shall see you there at six, sharp. It'll be my pleasure. It'll be my very great pleasure. (gentle music) (insects buzzing) Now, suppose you tell me what really happened. I've just had enough of that girl, thinking she can get everything that she wants, who she wants, when she wants it. When she started showing an interest in Thaddeus, that was the final straw. On now, Grace, I ain't got no interest in her. None at all. But I saw the way she looks at you. Now, when young folks have problems like y'all got... - That ain't nothin'. I promise, Grace. Are you sure Thaddeus? Because, she is kinda pretty, if you like that, uh. Are you absolutely sure, Thaddeus? Now I was thinking, if you two... - Of course I am. I'm sure, Grace. Why, that old girl? She couldn't hold a candle to you. But, I'm just sick of her getting whatever she wants, whenever she wants it, and it ain't even hers. When she started paying attention to you... Well, you ain't got nothing to worry about there, Grace. Besides, even if she did feel kinda sweet on me, well, you don't think that she... What, Thaddeus? I mean, she, uh... She what? Well, why would she anyways? She, she... Just hold on here. Hold on. Now, Miss Grace, I think I know just what happened and what you done. But girl, that is the judge's daughter. You got to know she ain't to fool with. She deserves special treatment just because of her bloodline. No, she don't. She don't deserve it, but you just need to calm down and think this through. I need to what, sheriff? You need to be smart, Miss Grace. That girl can cause your family a heap of trouble, problems your mama and daddy just don't need, that's all. Listen, I'm gonna release you on your promise that you will give miss Cathryn a wide berth. Just try and steer clear of her. Fine. I'll steer clear of her. And while I'm at it, I'll steer clear of you. And especially of you. Ah, now buttercup... Now hold on. Let me give you a thimble full of free advice. Stay away from Cathryn. You got a good, caring girl there in Grace, you don't need the trouble the judge can bring down on you for fooling with his daughter. Think I know my own mind. I don't need no man telling me how to act or what to do. Not some old judge, and especially not some old washed-up sheriff. (insects buzzing) (sheriff sighs) (twangy strings music) Kaitlyn, what are you doing? You know you're not supposed to be here. It's fine. Nobody saw me, I promise. Still, you have been told. Never to bother you in chambers. I know, I know, but, I wanted to see you. And besides, there's something you need to know. Well, you see me. What is it now I need to be aware of? How was your hearing? Did you come all the way over here just to ask about lawsuits? What is it I need to know about? Well it's, it's your daughter, Cathryn. What's happened? There was a slight altercation. Altercation. Is Cathryn hurt? No, no, she's fine. She just got into it with that Grace Laundry girl, and Grace accused Cathryn of being interested in her beau, and well it, it got a little physical. Physical? Where's Cathryn at now? Well, I'm assuming she's at home. And? And the sheriff showed up, and he and Thaddeus broke up the fight and... Great. Our no-account sheriff. And what exactly did he do about it? Well, he took Grace with him, so I'm assuming he took her to the jail. Bud, you've gotta let her out. She's gonna be frightened in that poor old jail. I guess that's her penance, isn't it? I'm sure that Cathryn wasn't the cause of this altercation, as you call it. Look, Bud, you've gotta let that poor girl out. She's probably frightened to death. (gentle music) Fine. I will talk to the sheriff for you. You're sure the Cathryn went straight home and that she wasn't hurt? I'm assuming so. She's fine, really. It was nothing at all. She's really all I have. Well you know it doesn't have to be, could have more. If you're speaking of yourself, you have to understand your station and mine. You know I care deeply about you, but how would it look? I really should be going. [Judge] I think you can stay a might longer. No, I really need to go. I think you can stay a might longer. Okay, I will. Of course you will. You know, I'm telling ya, this schooling stuff just ain't worth it. I mean, who really needs to know arithmetic? It's not like folks use that stuff in real life anyways. I ain't going no more. Yeah, all right. I ain't kidding either. I believe you. Well, you better. Perfection. You know, another thing, reading ain't as important as old lady Crabapple makes it out to be. Who's that? Old lady Crabapple? She's a schoolmarm. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if'n she wasn't teaching old George Washington when he crossed the Amazon. Amazon? Old George Washington didn't cross the Amazon. You crazy nut. Well, you're so smart. What river did he cross? Old George Washington crossed the mighty Mississippi back in 1492. Amazon, Mississippi, it don't matter none. He could cross his eyes for all I care. Ain't nobody gonna remember that stuff in a hundred years anyways. Mr. Silas, why am I not surprised to find you in this company on the street instead of being in school? Well ma'am, I was at school today, you just didn't notice me. Well mister, it would behoove you to make yourself noticed or I may have to take more drastic action. Well, miss ma'am, I think I was sick tomorrow. Sick, huh? (scoffs) Yes, ma'am. I think I might need a shot of whiskey from this here saloon to cure what ails me. If you step one foot in that den of iniquity, I will pull you out by your ear, and you will never wanna ever touch a drop of the devil's elixir again. Ma, ma'am. I ain't scared. I ain't scared of no old schoolmarm. Okay, pard, okay. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Kinda hard to believe, taking into account your melancholy appearance. You can talk to me, you know? Aren't you the same man that claims to know all, see all, and tell all? [Both] Nobody listens. You know the story, same as always. He gets to you that much? He's a good man, deep inside, really is. (sighs) Must be awful deep. But, just 'cause it's you, I'll take your word for it. You know, he needs someone to help with that girl, that wild girl. If he'd only drop that wall he's got around him and let someone in, then, well... Someone like you? No. Yeah, someone like me. How'd I get to this station in life, Bottles? I came from a good family, a strong family. They weren't too happy about me marrying so young and moving out West and, then Samuel died of the influenza, and (sighs) they still turn their backs on me. What was I supposed to do? He left me no money, no security. I mean, what could I do? Well, I did what I did, Bottles. I took care of me. I did what I needed to to survive. Nobody can judge me. Nobody's walked in my shoes, and nobody's felt what I felt. I did what I needed to survive. I did what I did and, I still do. Yes, you do, love. And I hear you're damn good at it. (laughs) What I love about you, Bottles. You're always so easy, to talk to anyway. That was very touching, you two. Makes me all warm inside. Problem is, I'm the only one warm inside. You get the tinder box out there and make them cowboys feel warm inside. And you, warm their insides with that whisky, or I'll toss you out in the thoroughfare, and neither of you will be warm inside. (pencil scratching) Your honor. (clears throat) What can I do for you? I'm just wondering, what is your side of the incident that happened to my daughter in the streets? Judge, let's not make something big out of a simple disagreement. A simple disagreement? Yes sir, that's how I saw it. That's how you saw it. That's how you saw it. There's no chance this was an assault upon my daughter, because it was a simple disagreement. Judge? Yes, sheriff? Cathryn is fine. Grace is fine. I had a talk with Grace and she assures me she won't cause any more problems. Let's just let this one lie. Let's just let it lie. Let's just let this lie. Is that how we handle law and order in town now, sheriff? We just don't prosecute crime anymore? Is that why this jail is empty? Because we just let it lie. Listen, if you wanna press charges, I'll give you the paperwork. If not, then this matter is closed. (pencil scratching) (judge chuckles) Who the hell do you think you are speaking to? Now, judge, I don't mean no disrespect. Oh the hell you don't. Least you forget, I can have you replaced (fingers snap) like that. Morning y'all. I can put him in charge, and this town would be served just as well. Oh gee sir, thanks. Shut up, you nitwit. I wanna tell you something, Tackett. If I want his Grace girl arrested. You will damn well do it. (sheriff's fist pounds) Is that what you want, judge? No, sheriff. No, I don't. Because I'm going to let you live with the decisions you make. Well, your honor, if there's nothing else. Oh, there's one more thing. I'm growing mighty weary of your ways, Tackett. (footsteps clicking) What's got him all steamed up? (sighs) Oh it's, it's that scuffle between his daughter and the Martin girl. He's just an overbearing father. Yeah, overbearing is damn right. No, cut him some slack. He, he was a good man. Fair judge. But, losing his wife at her tender age and raising that girl all alone, (chuckles) too stubborn to ask for help, that'll change a man. Oh, you known him awhile, sheriff? Quite awhile. We served in the Jeff Davis Artillery together during the war. Wow, I did not know that. Yeah. Yeah, well now you do. Ain't you got something to do? Oh, of course, sir. (insects buzzing) You sure your pa's okay with this? Us be out here at night and all? Why Thaddeus, is there a reason my daddy shouldn't trust you? Of course he can trust me, I didn't mean... Besides, my daddy's curled up with some brandy and the good book by now. What he doesn't know... (exhales) You sure smell mighty fine, Miss Cathryn. (Cathryn chuckles) Mighty fine. That's such a sweet thing to say. Do you really think so? Why, yes sir. (clears throat) I mean, ma'am. (Cathryn giggles) Mighty fine. You're such a sweetheart. I can see why the girls are so crazy about you, like myself. Like that nasty ole Grace. What do you see in her, Thaddeus? Well, I mean, she is nice and all. (scoffs) Well, I mean, aren't I nice too? Really, isn't it more wonderful to be here with me instead? You do like being with me, don't you, Thaddeus? Isn't it romantic to be together, here? It could be more romantic, if you'd like? Sure would. I mean, ra, romantic. (giggles) You just, you feel so warm, and I love how safe you make me feel. I bet she never felt like that about you. Oh, Miss Grace, are you sure your pa... Oh, let's not worry about him. Let's talk more about me and you. Um, me and you? Mm-hmm, you know, how you like to be around me, and how you long to be near me. How you'd like to kiss me. You would like to kiss me, wouldn't you, Thaddeus? I sure would. I mean, someday. Maybe soon. Soon? Yessum. Well, I mean, how soon? There's today soon, right now soon. Maybe, right now soon. (gasps) Did you hear that? Oh, oh no, I think it's my daddy. Wait, I thought... No, I'm certain, and he'll be furious if he catches you. But I didn't hear... Listen, he'll kill you if he finds out - But, Ms. Cathryn. - You were making advances at me. You have to go, please go, check and look. Go, go on. (deep suspenseful music) Go look. (deep suspenseful music) Go. (tense dramatic music) Cathryn, I thought you were in bed? Where have you been? I wasn't anywhere, Daddy. I, I was just... You were just what? Were you outside at this time of night? I was just walking, Daddy. With who? Cathryn, with who? (crying) Daddy. (Cathryn crying) He's just a nice young boy. Catherine, who were you with? Oh Daddy, I'm so sorry. (crying) Oh please. I'm so sorry. (crying) Is he still out there? He's out by the big tree where I left him. (crying) Oh, I'm so sorry. (Cathryn crying) I'm sorry. (crying) (birds chirping) Morning, nice day. Mind if I have a sit? Thanks. My, my, my, that looks delicious. Having your fill, are you? Something I can help you with, boy? Oh, yes there is. (Coleman slurps) Well, comfy are ya? Made yourself right at home. You have my attention. Well, you see, sir, I just arrived in town from an extended stay elsewhere. And, you see sir, I'm just looking to make some new friends, meet some people, maybe even that special girl, someone I could spend time with and get to know well, real, real well. That kinda girl is at the saloon that is up the street. No, no, no, not my type. I already have my eye on a pretty little thing. She's young, sweet, innocent. Say, you might even know her. Doubtful. Now, if it's all right with you, while it's still hot. Oh, not at all. Enjoy. It's been a pleasure getting to know you, mister? Bassett. Bassett. My name is Dobbs, Coleman Dobbs. I'll see you around, Judge Bassett. Waitress? (gentle somber music) (birds chirping) What? What is it? What do you want? Sir? What're you doing all the way up here? [Judge] Besides being disrespected? Now look, judge, I didn't, I didn't mean. You never do. Is that the reason you came all the way up here? Just to express your opinion of me in person? 'Cause I have a pretty good idea... Actually, young man, you have no idea how much I really admire you. Admire me? I do. (scoffs) You got an awfully strange way of showing it. Well, let's say I admire your talents. I'm here because I need your special skillset, once again. I need information. Now look, I thought I told you I was done doing fool's errands for you. And I thought I told you, I make those decisions, not you. Least you forget the reign of terror I could bring down upon you if I made one simple telegram to a certain United States marshal. Or how 'bout the pain I could inflict on you if I was to shut down the Chinese camp with their opium supply? Now look, if I injured your interest, I suggest you just get to the matter of which you came. Very well. I need information on a stranger in camp. I need to know his intentions. I need to know his purposes. And I need to know his plans. You, on the other hand, need to procure me this information. You will not disappoint me. Could I expect partial payment upfront, per usual? Per usual. (coins jangle) Balance upon the information. Yes, sir. And uh, does this stranger have a name? Or do I need to discover that information myself? Oh, he does. (daunting music) Coleman William Dobbs. 24 hours. [Informant] 24 hours. (daunting music) (pounding at door) Dad-blasted! Yeah, yeah I hear ya. Just hold on. What're you doing here at this ungodly hour in the morning? I wanna know what you're doing to find my boy. I reported him missing three days ago, and I ain't heard hair nor hide from you since. Just calm down. Just relax... Don't tell me to calm down, you two-bit tin star. This is my boy we're talking about. If you'd let me get a word in, you old coot, I'll tell you all we're trying to do to find your boy. Now Deputy Tilman and I have initiated a thorough investigation... Don't use those $4 words with me, you tin star. What're you doing to find my boy? Listen, I'm doing what I can. I'm leaving no stone unturned. Why, he probably decided to tie one on, and he's sleeping it off in a barn somewhere. Probably got a pretty gal with him too. Now, why don't you go home to Mildred, 'for she comes down here and fills out a report on you and decides she likes you better gone. Bill, he's just a boy, please. J.W., I'm doing what I can, I give you my word. Why don't you go on home, so I know where to find you when I get some news, all right? Oh, god. Oh my. Well, this is a surprise. When was the last time I saw you in here? Yesterday, and the day before that? And the day before that? Well, it is the best food in town, or so I'm told. So that's the only reason you're in here all the time? No. Quite frankly, I need to speak with you about something. It isn't good, the food, I mean. I do enjoy the waitress. Stop calling me that. Cathryn, I need to speak with you on a serious note. Not here though. Not now. Maybe later this afternoon. Why, Mr. Dobbs, a serious note? What could be so serious? I've only known you just these few days. When are you done here today? So serious. Um, today? Well, I'll be done here in just a few minutes. I do have to stop by and give my daddy his lunch, and then on my way to the sheriff's office. But um, I should be done with all of that later on this afternoon. That'll be fine. I know just a special place where we can have a serious talk. I should be getting back to work, but uh, later on then? I look forward to seeing you then. (slow somber music) (Coleman sighs) (birds chirping) Oh, hey, Miss Kaitlyn. Cathryn, how are you, sweetheart? Well, I'm just right as rain. Oh, you know what? I wonder if you'd do me a favor. I have my daddy's lunch, his absolute favorite. Miss Lizzie's famous fried chicken. Would you mind? No, I wouldn't mind at all. You sure seem chipper today. Me? Oh, do I? Yes, you. Really, it's nothing. I guess I'm just in good humor. So who is he? He? Yes, he, the boy that's putting that smile on your face. (chuckles) Miss Kaitlyn, it's really nobody special. Uh, it's just a nice young man. Mr. Dobbs and I are just friends. Mr. Dobbs? Yes, he's only been in town a week or so. Oh, and how long have you known this Mr. Dobbs? So many questions. Listen, I have to get this basket to the sheriff's office, but maybe we can chat later. Listen, Cathryn, please promise me that you'll take things slow and you'll be careful, all right? I'm always careful. Alrighty. So, you ain't seen hide nor hair of the Calhoon boy, huh? Nope, not in the past couple of days, but uh, he and I ain't really been that friendly since he started up with Grace Martin. Oh, a telegram on the table somewhere for you. All right. Hey, (sighs) whatever happened to that kid that used to run with you and Calhoon? What kid? That kid, the, the heavy kid. Three of you used to fish down by the old mill. You mean Marcus? Was that his name? Was that whose name? Who do you think we're talking about? Is Marcus the fellow that would fish with you and Thaddeus? Well, sometimes, but he ain't really ever caught nothing. He was always... And, what happened to that kid? I ain't seen him around here in a while neither. You know, I ain't neither. You know, last I heard, he had a girl who was sweet on him. (laughs) He ain't never really had any ladies before or uh, or really any, any friends, neither. He's a, he wasn't much of a ladies man like some of us. Meaning? Well, ain't you ever noticed that when I walk around town, the girls always pay special attention? Ah, they are days... No, meaning, which girl took a fancy to him? And if he ain't around, where'd he go? You're still talking about that? Uh, (sighs) I think he said her name was Cindy or Katie. Maybe Cathy? I don't know. I just figured he moved. Could her name had been Cathryn? Cathryn? Like the judge's daughter? [Sheriff] Yeah. Mm, no. No, Marcus said that she had long, beautiful brown hair. Miss Cathryn is a brunette. So. What about Marcus' pa, is he still around these parts? Of course he is. He's down at the saloon tendin' bar right now. It's Bottles. Bottles is his father? That's what Marcus said. I always wondered about it though, 'cause I didn't, I didn't think they looked alike. Here, make yourself useful. Finish these reports. Get off your lard ass and get over here, take my spot. I will be back. Yeah, all right. Hey, y'all. Miss Lizzie over at the cafe had your lunch prepared. You leaving, sheriff? Yeah, I got rounds to do, Miss Cathryn. Smells like fried chicken. That it does. Can't though, Miss Cathryn. But you tell that lazy deputy of mine to save me some. Okay, I will. Good day to ya. Well now, Miss Cathryn, it's just you me. Well, you're half right. Well, hold on a minute. You and I have some issues to discuss. - Issues? - Issues. What kind of issues? Like the fact that you ain't never realized what a prize catch you've got sittin' right here in front of you. (laughs) A prize catch? A prize catch. Is that a fact? Oh ma'am, that is more than a fact. That's a fact's fact. Well, now that you've said something, I may have missed that. Mm, maybe you have. How could I have been so naive? Why, just to have this prize catch right here in front of me. Mm-hmm. Tall and handsome, good-looking. Mm-hmm. Admired by the community. Oh, I know. Any woman would just be absolutely fortunate to have you, wouldn't she? - Mm-hmm. I made that sign. Oh, well, handyman at that. Truly, truly lucky they would be, wouldn't they? Mm-hmm. Very fortunate. But, I guess I'll just never know what I'm missing. (exhales) Miss Cathryn, you are something else. (Cathryn laughs) Afternoon. Need to ask you a few questions. About? Well, you seem to pretty much know the comings and goings of this camp. Wonder if you're familiar with a loner goes by the name of Jordan Tate? He's just a young fella. He's about my height, but brown hair, brown eyes. He stopped into the office, oh, several weeks back. He seemed like a real nice kid. I can't say I do, sheriff. I don't know why you're asking me anyway. Now young Jordan told me he was gonna stay a few days and then head up to Colorado. But he was gonna stop in and say goodbye before he left town. Now that was (sighs), almost six weeks ago. Then this morning, I get a telegram from his Aunt Susan up in Colorado. Seems she got a letter from him written the very day he arrived here. Oh, he told her about meeting me, told her when he thought he'd arrive up there. But he also told her about meeting a friend of his, Marcus, Marcus James. That name seem familiar to you, Mr. James? Why should it? What are you getting at, sheriff? Are you saying I know something about him disappearing? Who said anything about disappearing? You just said that he, he... I said he hadn't arrived, that's all. In fact, I wanna ask your boy about Jordan, but, seems I can't find Marcus neither. (Bottles sighs) He's your boy, ain't he? He, he ain't my son. Who, who said he was my son? I ain't got no kin, especially like him. What's this about, sheriff? Why you asking about this Jordan fella? - Simmer down. - Instead of looking for my boy? Simmer down, J.W. Let me do my job. I ain't got no information about these boys. He ain't my son. He ain't, I tell ya. Now, what're you gettin' excited for? We're just talking. I don't like these questions. I don't like having to answer questions that ain't got nothing to do with me. I ain't got no information about these boys. I mean, sure they were friends, the three of 'em, but that, that's all. The three of them? My boy? All three of 'em knew each other, Jordan, Thaddeus, and, and Marcus? What do you know about my missing boy? - Nothing. Nothing. - Simmer down. Let him talk. All I know is that they were talking about the judge's girl. They came in one night, and each said he weren't scared at all about if the judge found out. You know kinda brag talking, especially the Calhoon boy. Look, Calhoon. Turn loose of him. (deep suspenseful music) Put that thing down. Bottles, put it down. Calhoon, you need to back on outta here, real slow-like. Calhoon! Just back on out and go on home now. Bottles, nobody wants to hurt you. But I can't put my gun down till you put that thing down. You all right? Now take it easy. (deep tense music) All right, Bottles. Let's talk a walk. You put the fear of God in us, man. Come on. (deep tense music) It's gonna be okay. (birds chirping) (flask cap scraping) (birds chirping) Ah. (Coleman sighs) (birds chirping) Nevermore, you quim. You will never see her face again after today. You took everything from me. And I'm just here to return the favor. I'm taking her from you. (slow tense music) You're taking her from who? Hey, calm down. Who are you taking, and from whom? This is a great way to get yourself shot, mister. Walking into a camp, someone you don't know. Best you just turn around and forget you ever heard anything. I can do that, but uh, just gonna have a little conversation. Now, I could leave. But it's still gonna leave me wondering uh, who you're talking about. Oh, does it now? Why, yes sir, yes it does. Who are you? And give me one good reason why I shouldn't blow you to hell. Okay, relax. Ponder on this one for a minute. I have no love for Judge Bassett, but I know you, and I know what you did. Uh, uh. Relax. I uh, I know things about the judge, about Cathryn, that could help you out. I work alone. (gunshot blasts) (men grunting) (adventurous music) (informant groaning) (tense somber music) (gunshot blasts) (tense somber music) You were right. (Coleman spits) This did help. (tense somber music) (gunshot blasts) (tense somber music) (birds chirping) (gentle melodious music) Well, well, well, Miss Kaitlyn. Looks like you're turning this into an everyday habit. Well, I can if you'd like. Thought we could share lunch. Brought you Lizzie's special fried chicken. Well, it's cold now. Been here a while. Yeah, it doesn't matter. You know how much I love Miss Lizzie's fried chicken, hot or cold. Well, you can thank Lizzie for that. Yeah, remind me to do so. You said it's been here a while. When did Cathryn drop it off? Well she didn't, exactly. She was on her way to the sheriff's to drop them theirs, and asked me if I could bring you yours. So I told her I could. Reckon she was anxious to, I reckon she was anxious to get everybody their food quickly. Kaitlyn, you have any idea how long I've been on the bench? No, Bud, but I'm sure it's been a while. Yes it has. And in all those years, I've become very astute at knowing when someone's trying to piss on me, and tell me that it's raining. Now, why was she in such a hurry to drop off the basket? She get to end her workday afterwards? Bet she's gonna go home and take a nap, 'cause God knows that girl can sleep. What's she got going on? Kaitlyn? Now, Bud, promise me you won't jump to no conclusion. What? She's met someone, someone new, and, well she's promised me she's takin' it slow and she's okay. Where is she? She's fine, Bud. Kaitlyn, she is not fine. Where is she? You're scaring me. (slow suspenseful music) You know, for someone who had something serious on his mind, you've been awfully quiet. You know, I just love this time of year. The leaves falling and weather changing. Don't you? It's not really my favorite time. It's just too cold for me. I wanted to tell you that the last few days have been special, real special for me. I just love this place. You know, my mama used to bring me here when I was a little girl and, (chuckles) we'd play and eat cookies and milk and sing silly songs. And she, she used to call me her special girl. Your mother? This was our secret place. It was special to her, and to me now also. You two still come here together? Um, my mama isn't here anymore. You see, we were here one day, and these men rode up. I remember them telling me how beautiful she was. And then I had to sit and watch. I was just a helpless little girl. I couldn't, I couldn't save her from the terrible things they did to her. I'm so sorry. They had a knife. Looked like a strange little thing at first, you couldn't tell what it was. Till they opened it up. I've seen things, things nobody should witnessed. Well, you don't have to worry anymore. I'm here now. And I'll make sure no one else hurts you. You know, I used to wonder what my purpose was. Why, why they kept me alive, but, I'm here now, and this is my special place and, (sighs) you're, you're my special guy. I'm, I'm sorry. I just, c'mon, lay down. I get so worked up I, I miss my mama so. But, I'm all right, I'm okay now. I'm just so happy to be here with you. Special guy. Miss Cathryn, I need to tell you something. You once asked me if I knew who your father was, if I knew you. I do know. I know who your father is. I know how I've come to feel about you. You've changed things for me, Cathryn. Cathryn, I'm falling in love with you. Oh honey, that's so sweet. I love you too. (gunshot blasts) (tense music) You bastard. You shot your own daughter. Stop. (gunshot blasts) Check on Cathryn. Bud, why? She's your own daughter. You shot her down in cold blood. (judge crying) I couldn't stop her... From what, Bud? I couldn't stop her from killing them! She killed them! She killed them all. - Cathryn killed those boys? She killed 'em. I had to stop her. Bud, I'm sorry. (dramatic music) (gunshot blasts) [Sheriff] Stay down. [Coleman] He killed his own daughter. Shut up. Cathryn? She's gone, sheriff. All right. Check him for weapons. Take him to the jail and then go get the doc. (slow somber music) Get up. [Sheriff] How is he? He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be all right. Over there, that's where you'll find the boys, among a few others. Bud told me he buried 'em there. He did it out of love, Bill. I know, but, his whole life was about the law. (deep somber music) Now he'll have to face it himself. All right. (slow melancholic strings music) Oh. Well, I didn't expect to see you awake so soon. I told the sheriff you'd be out for at least an hour. (winces) How did I, how did I get here? (chuckles) Well, when you arrived, the sheriff and a couple of those other fellows was carrying ya, seems you passed out along the way. You lost a lot of blood in your stomach, Bud. Now I came over here quick as a whip, after I tended to that other fellow they took off to the jail. I was able to get it packed off, and it should be all right, but that bullet went right through. But it uh, nicked a vessel on the way out. So you gotta be careful. If you move around too much, that uh, that could start bleeding again, and that would not be happy. So you just rest right there till the sheriff gets back. (sighs) Till the sheriff gets back to haul you off to the jail to wait for the circuit judge. Circuit judge? Bud, the sheriff says you shot Cathryn! And he says it was intentional. Nah, I don't believe that, Bud. You're too good a man for that. You would not do that. There has to be another answer. It had to be accidental. Something else happened. Tell me, what happened? All right. Sheriff'll be along soon. What do you think you are doing? You lay back down... - I do not... [Doc] And you stay there. Answer to the sheriff! I do not answer to a circuit judge. I make the laws! I pronounce judgment! Not a circuit judge! Bud, come on. You come back here. You get in that. What? Bud. (Doc groaning) (Bud cries out) (Doc groaning) I Am... (slow somber music) (deep daunting music)
