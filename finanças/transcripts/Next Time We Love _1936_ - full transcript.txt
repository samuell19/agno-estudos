It's right down this street here. What's the name of the place, buddy? The George Washington? No. Martha Washington. It's a hotel for women. Oh, yeah? There it is, right where that light is. Wait right here. Will you call up Ms. Cicely Hunt and tell her Mr. Tyler's here, please? Just a minute, young man. Oh, no. I'm in a hurry. She's waiting for me. Cicely Hunt? She's checked out. Oh, well, there must be some mistake. Will you ring her room anyway, please? There's no one in her room. She's checked out, I told you. Oh, there's a young lady over there seems to be waiting for somebody. Cicely. Hey, Cicely, darling, you've got to wake up. (MOANS) Hey, you've got a train to catch, young lady. It leaves at 6:30. Hmm? Oh. I'm sorry, darling. I hate to wake you up. You looked so funny asleep. Oh, porter, put those in the taxi, will you? Oh, I was having such a nice dream. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, sir. Pennsylvania Station. I meant to get up sooner, but our city editor kept us all waiting around for a flash on Lindbergh's flight to Paris. Oh, any word? No. He hasn't been sighted yet. I had to cover the story about the referee stopping the fight at the Polo Grounds to pray for Lindbergh. Pretty good yarn. Front page? Well, I hope to tell you the front page. That's two front page stories this week. Pretty soon they'll be putting your name on your stories. Yeah. This cab goes fast enough, but that train will go a lot faster. It's pretty awful, isn't it? Oh, darling, don't talk like that. "Parting is such sweet sorrow." Whoever said that? Juliet, I think. A lot she knew. (BABY CRYING) I could have let you dream a little longer. I'm glad you didn't. It gives us this many more minutes. I'll meet you at the train, boss. All right, fine. It'll be weeks and weeks, won't it, before we... Oh, you'll be busy. (GIGGLES) Yes. Junior prom with little boys from Princeton. Rehearsals for The Merchant of Venice. Student Council. Well, anyway, there's just one more year after that. By that time, you'll be wealthy and important. A year and a half almost. Time enough for you to meet girls who've already gotten started, newspaperwomen and artists and, well, not just college girls. Yes, and time enough for you to meet a lot of college guys who have time for weekends. I don't mean that any more than you meant what you said. Chris, if you did meet a girl you didn't have to wait for, I'd understand. What would you understand? It doesn't seem fair to you, that's all. A girl away at college is such a useless person to be in love with. Darling, I think you're very sweet and understanding about a young man's problems, but do you mind very much if I just go on loving you and do without the artist or the newspaperwoman or whatever she is? If there was one, I'd come right up and scratch her eyes out. Trains for Manhattan Transfer. Newark, Elizabeth, Princeton Junction, Trenton and Atlantic City. All aboard! We still have time. Let's wait out here. (EXCLAIMS) What'll I tell Ms. Dudley about the dentist? Dentist? That was my excuse to come to New York. Well, don't you have an old inlay that looks like new? Yeah. There's one looks like it's been put in today. Yeah? Right there. I put your bag under the third seat, boss. Oh, fine. Here. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I suppose there's some satisfaction in doing what's sensible. Yes. Particularly when there isn't much choice. You ought to do what I do. When you get up in the morning, you should say to yourself, "Day by day, "in every way, I get sensibler and sensibler." CONDUCTOR: All aboard! Cicely, darling, what would happen if you didn't take this train? Why? It wouldn't matter if you wanted me to stay. Now stay right there. Stay right there. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. If there's anything I object to it's demonstrations of affection in public places. Me, too. It's just one flight up. The key. (DOOR CLOSING) Chris, I like this. I don't really rate all this luxury. I... I mean... I mean bedroom and sitting room. They just let me have it while... While the real tenant is away. He's a foreign correspondent on our paper, down in Mexico now. What will you do when he comes back? Oh, well, they'll send him away someplace else, Timbuktu or someplace. Is that how newspaper correspondents live? Well, the successful ones do. Lots of people who got famous afterwards lived in this house, didn't they? Important people. Yeah. The landlady will tell you all about them sometime. She's the Italian woman who lives in the basement and cooks marvelous spaghetti dinners for her favorite tenants. Yeah. She'll tell you all about them. Oh, she'll tell you about O. Henry. He used to live right here in this house. You told me. Oh. Darling, I know as well as you do we're making conversation and doing it badly. Never mind, let's go on. Well, you might take off your hat and coat. I mean, I wouldn't take it too seriously if you did. I mean... There really isn't very much of a view from here, but we have a very fine view of a tree from this one over in there. Oh, nice. (SNIFFING) I can smell the North River and almost see the ships. Hey, Cicely, you're shaking. No, I'm not. Oh, my darling, say you're glad and I'll be glad. Or say you're sorry if that's true. I'll send you back to college on the next train. I'll think of some excuse that will be all right. I'm glad! What made you decide not to take the train? You asked me not to. No. I mean what made you say yes? Oh, I made up my mind long ago I'd say yes if you ever asked me to stay. There's never been anyone else for me. Nor for me. Chris, I can't be... I can't be sensible. Not when you're so close and I'm so happy. Where do I sit? Here? Just not too close. Chris, just because I got off that train this morning, I don't want you to think... Well, I mean, it isn't necessary... Think what? Well... Are you trying to tell me that I don't have to marry you? Why, darling... Somebody has to be sensible. A girl at 21 is older in many ways than a man is at 25. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I know all about that superstition, Grandma. If I were your grandmother, you know what I'd advise you? What big eyes you have, Grandma. I'm serious. If I came to you and said, "Grandma, I love this girl and I earn $25 a week as a newspaper reporter, "and I want to marry and live happily ever after," do you know what I'd say? No. What would you say, Grandma? I'd say, "It's the spring, my son, nothing but the spring." The trouble with you, Grandma, is you're old fashioned. And the trouble with you, Grandpa, is that I adore you. There's somebody at the door. Hey! Hey! Tommy, come here. A friend of mine. Cicely, this is Thomas Abbott. Cicely Hunt. He lives downstairs in front. He's in the motion picture business and he's crazy. How do you do, Tommy? How do you do? Hey, what are you doing out at this hour in the morning? I was just coming in. Well, how long will it take you to pull yourself together? How much together? Mr. Abbott, how would you like to be a witness at our wedding? Hey, let me get this thing straight. Something about a wedding? Yep. Yours, I suppose? When? This morning. Now go on. Get a shower and get dressed. But, Chris! What am I going to wear? My blue georgette or my striped pants? Have you got striped pants? Have I got striped pants. Then he can be our best man if he has striped pants. Well, I don't suppose the best man can say, "This is so sudden." I didn't get a chance to say it myself. Well, let's get organized. Now, who you going to get for best maid? I mean maid of honor. I don't know. Everybody I know is off at school. Why not Madame Donato? Why not? I'll rush right down and ask her. I'll have to call the office, too. I'll be right back, darling. Goodbye. Goodbye. And I thought the best man was the one supposed to do the rushing around. You know, calming the hysterical bride or sobering up the bridegroom. There must be something... Sobering up? There's an idea, a cold shower. Right away, quick. Goodbye. I'll see you later. Goodbye. (CORK POPPING) And now we drink to... Let's see, who do we drink to now? There's nobody left. Look, let's just drink. I've got an idea. How about the clerk in the marriage bureau? Yes. To the clerk. Now, wait. Don't drink it all on the clerk. I want to propose a toast. Here's to Tommy. May he be as good a friend of Chris and Cicely as he is of just Chris. (COUGHS) That's a very nice toast, even if it did get up your nose. I guess I'm not used to drinking champagne. Oh, well, cold shower, champagne. Champagne, cold shower. So it goes. I'm so happy! Oh, my darling! (CLEARS THROAT) I've got to call the office. Oh, why bother? They get newspapers out every day. No, I'd better call them. I'll be right back. I wonder what it is they do to newspapermen to make them work so hard? Maybe they hypnotize them. They don't have to do anything to Chris. I know. He likes his work, and I envy him. I hope he never stops. I think that's what makes him such an exciting person. I'm sorry. That's all right. It's your wedding day. Go ahead and talk about him. There doesn't seem to be much else on my mind except my marriage and what I've got to do not to spoil it. Aren't you beginning to worry a little early? It's only 2:00. Oh, I'm in such a whirl, I can't make sense. What I mean is, well, I've made a resolution. I'm simply not going to be a burden to Chris. How do you propose not to be a burden? I'm going to have work of my own to do. You see, we both feel that the trouble with most marriages is that the women haven't got anything to do. They just hang on to the man and keep them from doing the things they want to. And you've figured all that out since this morning? No. We've done a lot of talking about marriage. In theory, anyway. Only now it's sneaked up on you. Yes. Just what sort of work do you want to do? I'd like to go on the stage. Can you act? I did quite a lot in college. Well, I know a lot of people in the theater. Maybe I can help you. That would be nice. Uh-oh. Bad news from the front. Of all the dirty tricks! What's the matter? Somebody just murdered Dutch Hoeffler. A friend of yours? Yeah. No. No. He's a gangster. They want me to go over to Jersey City right away and get the dope. Well, didn't you tell them you just got married? Yes, I told them and they told me Dutch Hoeffler just got murdered, so what about it? You see, I wrote the first story on Dutch when he was first arrested. Now it's all broken wide open. I don't know what to do. Of course you have to go, darling. It's not a very nice wedding day for you. I would marry a newspaperman. I don't know when I'll be back. Oh, I... Here's the key to the apartment. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Tommy. Bye, Chris. Well, I guess, I... Oh, have some champagne. No, thank you. I've been up so long, I guess I'm a little jittery. I don't wonder. You must think I'm an awful ninny, all my talk about marriage and Chris' work, and now just because he has to go to Jersey City... I've got an idea. I'm due at a dress rehearsal of a play my company is considering for pictures. If you want to go along it's okay. You can leave whenever you want to. Would it be all right? Certainly. And besides, you'll meet some people in the theater it'll be good for you to know. Oh, I'd love to go. All right. Hey, boy. WAITER: Yes, sir. Good evening, Madame Donato. Hello, Mrs. Tyler. Is Mr. Tyler in? Yes. He just threw me out. He is? Do you suppose it's all right for me to go up? I think if you be very quiet. It's all right. I have work to do, too. Good night. Good night. How are you, darling? How'd the rehearsal go? Oh, Chris, listen. Mr. Jennings just gave me two new lines. Isn't that marvelous? Wonderful. Listen, how's your work going? Listen. Wait till I... Listen to this... I'm sorry. It wasn't anything. You go on. I just finished this Mussolini thing for Sunday. Oh, did you? Read it to me. Want to hear it? Yeah. The disaster at Caporetto was a nightmare five days old and now still through the village north of the Piave, deserters slunk homeward with no one to hinder them. Italy had not been more utterly at the mercy of the enemy since the last of the Roman legions fled from Attila. Only one man to rally a prostrate nation, Mussolini raised his shrill voice above the babbling panic and put new courage into the hearts of his countrymen. That was his real beginning. Oh, that's grand, Chris. You think that's all right, huh? You don't think it's too fancy? Certainly not. Wait till I put my things away. I don't know. I think maybe I'll tone it down a little. I wouldn't change a single word of it. You wouldn't? No. Look, Chris, would you mind cuing me? I want to be sure of these new lines. Sure. Sure. Where does it start? Right there? "Bell." (MIMICS BELL RINGING) Yes, Mr. Cranton. "And a little buttered toast." Yes, Mr. Cranton. Mr. Cranton, I hope you won't mind my saying this, but... "Ahead my child." Well, I couldn't help overhearing what Mr. Brown said to you, and I want you to know that I'm terribly sorry and if... I'd do anything to help you. Anything at all. Look, darling, that last line... Yes. What about it? (STUTTERS) I don't think you mean that you'd do anything for him. I mean, when you say "anything at all" like that, it sort of sounds as if you mean that... That's the way I did it at rehearsal, exactly like that. Oh, I know, I know, but, after all, you're just playing a maid's part. You don't have to get so emotional about it. I'm not emotional. All right. Okay. I... Okay. Forget about it. I just thought... Now we'll go on, here. "Kind of you." "Kind of you"? What's the matter? Nothing. Maybe I'd just better go over it myself. Well, I'm sorry, darling. I didn't think you'd mind a little honest criticism. I don't mind criticism. But you wouldn't like it if I made fun of your story. Anyhow, I don't need to do it now. Well, wait a minute. I... It's all right. Chris. Oh, I'm such a goose. Darling, I'm so ashamed, taking myself so seriously. Well, I got a lot of nerve trying to tell you how to act. But it is fun, isn't it? Each of us so busy and getting on a little. That's just the way we figured, isn't it? Can it keep on like this getting better and better, month after month? Sometimes I'm so happy it frightens me. Yeah, you always want to worry about something, don't you? Please read me the rest of your story. Oh, no. After you've read me your scene. Give me a kiss first? MAN: All right, I'll tell him. Goodbye. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) I'll be back after dinner. About 9:00. Yes, Mr. Carteret. Hello, Mr. Carteret. Hello, Tyler. I read your Sunday story on Russia. Thank you very much, sir. I didn't say I liked it. For plain reporting, it's a little too fancy. Not enough facts. It's pretty hard to get the facts when you're 5,000 miles away. Where'd you learn Italian? Oh, when I was a kid, my family dragged me over most of Europe. You speak any other languages? French and German. I suppose you've heard about the vacancy in our Rome office? Yes, sir, I heard about that. Oh, I see. That accounts for all those European Sunday stories of yours. Oh, no, I wouldn't say that. See me after dinner. About 9:00. Yes, sir. Wait down there somewhere. I'll only be a minute. (DOOR RATTLES) (SHUSHING) (INAUDIBLE) You know, you two are beginning to get on my nerves. Finish your drink and beat it, will you? Has Ms. Tyler gone on yet? She's upstairs. She'll be down in a minute. Okay. Thanks. Chris! Darling! Darling, the most marvelous thing has happened. Now, you'd better send out for Jennings and tell him. I just saw him out front. Tell him what? I just have a moment... What are you talking about? We're going to Rome next week. Rome? Rome, Italy. You'll have to tell Jennings to get somebody else to take your place. But, darling... The managing editor just told me. They're sending me to Rome to be second in charge of our... (EXCLAIMS) I'm sorry. Darling, that's marvelous. Listen, I've got to go on now. Wait and tell me about it at the end of the act. Well, I can't. I've got to beat it and arrange for things. Be sure and tell Jennings, huh? We're ready, Ms. Tyler. Yes. I'm coming. Talk about it later. But, darling, aren't you happy about it? I mean, you're not very excited. Of course I am. I'll call you later, huh? Yes. This is your entrance, Ms. Tyler. Thank you. Listen, listen, darling, I'll get a hold of Tommy, and we'll go out someplace and celebrate. Sorry. ACTOR: Marjorie. Darling, I thought they'd never go. It was worth waiting for, wasn't it? Nan was a bit difficult. I hope they don't come back. She loves you, doesn't she? (BAND PLAYING MUSIC) And he'll be second in charge. That means he'll have some very important interviews. And he sails next week. That's all there is to tell. For a reporter's wife, your account of what's happened wouldn't win any Pulitzer Prize for journalism. No. I suppose not. Tommy, what is it you do to bridges? Bridges? Burn them behind you. No, you don't burn them until you cross them. Well, should we dance or should we wait for Chris or should we have another drink? Yes. The only trouble is... For a minute, I actually thought you were going to tell me what you were speaking about. The only trouble is what? Let's dance. Let's. Maybe it'll clear things up a bit. I like being with you, Tommy. I don't ever have to worry about making sense. You make me feel like an old pair of slippers. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) Hey, hey! Hello! Congratulations, my boy. Thank you, Tommy. Well, I'll be in the bar. Okay. Hey, did you see Jennings? Mr. Jennings? Oh, no. You said you were gonna see him. No, let's dance. (MUSIC PLAYING) You know, you just can't walk out on Jennings. No, I know. When are you gonna tell him? Tomorrow. Do you know, I was so excited, I think I had one too many Old Fashioneds. Did you? Well, that's good. We were going to drink up the town anyway tonight. Look, what about Jennings? Oh. Chris... Yeah? I don't think I'd better go with you next week. Not go to Rome with me? I've been thinking about it very hard. Maybe we'd better sit down. But, Cicely, what's this all about? You're not going? Well, why? For one thing is the money. My passage over... But I'll be getting a good enough salary and living is very cheap over there. Well, it isn't only the money, darling. After all, you're starting on a new job. You shouldn't have to have me on your mind. I've done all right so far with you on my mind. Yes, I know. Oh, let's don't talk about it tonight, anyway. (ALL APPLAUDING) What's the real reason you don't want to go? I told you. No, there's something else. Well, I guess it's the same reason I don't want to ask Mr. Jennings to give someone else my part. Are you kidding? Well, after all, I did get good notices, and I had such a good start it seems a shame... Yes, they were good notices, weren't they? Well, it's a good story. Newspaperman marries actress, paths diverge and... Chris, I thought you were glad about my working. Well, it was all right while we were waiting for a break. You mean while you were waiting for a break. I think I'd like a drink, please. As long as we're supposed to be having a good time. I think you've had about enough. But if I hadn't told you, you wouldn't have known I had any. You're just being unreasonable. I'm being perfectly reasonable. Well, it's my own fault. I should have known what would happen if I let you go on the stage. Let me? Well, encouraged you then. You couldn't help it if you got stage struck. Stage struck? Me? How could I be stage struck when I'm already on the stage? A couple of critics flatter you and then you go crazy. Well, at last I see things in their true light. What's that? A line from your new play? Chris, would you mind lending me $1, please? Certainly. Thank you. I'll pay you back tomorrow. Hey. Thank you, Tommy. (BAND PLAYING MUSIC) Cicely was tired. She thought she'd go home. Well, it's been an exciting day for both of you. Yeah. How'd she like the idea of Italy? She thinks it's fine. For me. She's not going. Huh? I can't really blame her. She's in this play with Jennings. And, well... She can get out of that. I'll see Jennings myself. No. It wouldn't be fair to take her away from her work. We've agreed on that. Like a drink? No, thanks. (SOBBING) (DOOR OPENING) Cicely. Cicely. Cicely, what happened to us tonight? I don't know. It was awful, though. It wasn't me saying all those things. And it wasn't me. Just the thought of leaving you coming so suddenly the way it did, it made me sick all over. What's it going to be like when I really have to be without you? Darling. Chris, I want to say something to you and I don't know how. Am I all you want of women in the world? You're all I'll ever want of women in the world. Then nothing can hurt us, my Chris, because you're all I want of men. (GONGING) All ashore that's going ashore. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) STEWARD: All ashore that are going ashore. I'll manage to sail months before you expect me. Or else I'll manage to get leave and I'll come back and bring you over. It'll happen like that. It's got to. I'll see you in a minute. (FOGHORN BLOWING) Cigarette? Cicely, I suppose you know what you're doing, but just whose career are you thinking of, his or yours? It isn't altogether a question of careers, Tommy. It was simply that I didn't think I'd be much help to him in Rome. I can't quite believe that. If I were more or less sick for months, and he had to worry about doctors and where to get pasteurized milk for the baby... What? Oh. Naturally, Chris doesn't know. Certainly not. You've got to promise not to let him know. Do you really think his career, or any career for that matter, is that important? I don't know, Tommy. At the time it seemed right. Maybe I've done something I'll regret for the rest of my life. All I know is that if I'd told him about the baby, he wouldn't have gone. Cicely, sometimes I think you're one of the wisest women I've ever known. Sometimes I think you're just a little girl with a lot of romantic nonsense in her head. At the moment I don't know which. Would it amuse you to go and dance somewhere? Thank you, Tommy. I'd better get used to going back to the apartment without Chris there. May I have that cigarette now? GRAYSON: Yes, sir. Grayson, come in here a minute, and bring your book. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Is this cable all we've had from Tyler? Yes. The letter he refers to there hasn't arrived. Do you know when he left Rome? What steamer? The Savoie. Take a radiogram. Christopher Tyler, S.S. Savoie. Your explanation preposterous. Nothing can excuse leaving us unrepresented in Rome during crucial political... Just a minute. "Unrepresented in Rome..." During crucial political situation. Stop. You are dismissed. Effective, date of your desertion. Frank Carteret. Is that all, sir? Yes. (FOGHORN BLOWING) (PEOPLE CLAMORING) Hey, Chris! Tommy, Tommy, glad to see you. Chris, how are you? Gosh, you're looking swell. You have a good trip? Look. Now wait a minute. Before you start worrying, everything is great. Cicely's fine. The baby's fine. There's not a thing to worry about. All right. All right. Gosh, how did you ever get down here at this hour? I stayed up, I stayed up. Come on. Let's get through the customs. She's all right? She's fine. Great. Sure. So long, Tommy. So long, kid. Thanks for meeting me. I'll call at the office. You'd better let me call you. I thought we might have lunch. Yeah, we might at that. Tommy, I don't know why I didn't tell you this before, but I'm not with the paper anymore. Oh? Oh, here you are. No, don't tell Cicely anything about it, but when I got that cable from Madame Donato about the baby, I was in a panic. My boss was someplace in Switzerland and I couldn't reach him, so I walked out on them. Well, couldn't you explain to them? Oh, yes, I explained, but they explained right back to me by radiogram that my name was mud. Oh, you'll get something else. Oh, sure. It'll take a little looking around, I suppose, but I'll get something all right. Well, see you later. So long, kid. Madame Donato, don't you think I look a little pale? How about some rouge? No, darling. You look very nice. Chris. Darling! Oh, you crazy kid. Was it really so awful for you, darling? I was always looking forward to this moment. (BABY CRYING) Oh. You'd better go over and get yourself introduced. Oh, yeah. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Stop, Madame Donato. You know he picks up everything he hears. (BABY WHINING) Well. Well, what? Well, it's a very fine-Iooking baby, isn't it? Can you touch it? It's name is Kit. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Tommy told me. Well, can I touch him? You might try. Oh, he's warm, isn't he? Sort of like milk toast, huh? (CRYING) Oh, did I do that? No. He just beginning to get hungry. Oh. What do you feed him? Oh, really, darling. And you a college man. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) I'll be back a little later. Darling, I thought... You won't ever leave me again, will you? Never. No matter what. Not even to go to the office. They can wait. You mustn't annoy the fish, sir. I'm sorry. (CLEARS THROAT) Any nibbles, mister? Well, Tommy! Where did you come from? Just got in this morning. Hollywood looks like a movie set, I didn't meet Greta Garbo. How are you? How is Cicely? Fine, we're both fine. Well, how did you find out I was down here? That's easy. Madame Donato to City News to Aquarium. Never lost a clue. I thought you were going to stay in Hollywood. No, no. Say, Madame Donato told me that Cicely had gone to the doctor with the baby. Yes. He just hatched a new tooth. Well, it's good to see you, Tommy. What are you doing down here anyway? Well, I'm waiting for a kiss. For what? The fish kiss. At least they're supposed to. Gee! You look swell. They do what? They kiss, the fish. Don't ask me why. That's what they sent me down here to find out. You get paid for that? Well, such as it is. City News Bureau. Oh. Look, they're getting together again. Do you suppose they're going to kiss now? They've been doing that all day. That's just a stall. How do you happen to be working for City News? Well, walking out on that Rome job didn't exactly help me when I went to get another one. Uh-oh. They've never done that before. I wish they'd make up their minds. Maybe they're bashful. Say, Chris, I went down to Tijuana for a weekend, you know, and I had a lot of dumb luck gambling, and I've got more money than I can shake a stick at... Thank you, Tommy. Thanks. You know, this City News Bureau is just temporary. I have several other things coming up. Publicity job and... What sort of publicity jobs? I have a chance to go out ahead of a circus. Of course, it's pretty good pay. Of course, I'll have to leave Cicely. Well, look, how about coming out and having lunch? I'm sorry, I can't, Tommy. I got to wait here for a call. Oh, I tell you. Cicely ought to be home by this time. Why don't you take her to lunch? That's just what I'll do. It's a swell idea. Yeah, you'd better hurry if you want to catch her. Oh, sure. Well, so long. See you later. So long, Tommy. Hello, Cicely. Tommy. I was so excited when I found your message at home. How was Hollywood? Oh, very kind to me. How are you, huh? Gosh! Looking fat, isn't he? Isn't he? Say, would the young man mind if you took him home and I took you to lunch? Oh, thank you, Tommy. I've already had lunch. Why don't you ask Chris? I'm sure he'd love to lunch with you. I met Chris downtown. He couldn't get away for lunch. Yes? It seems to me that you and Chris are very concerned about lunch for each other. You mind if I get to the point right away? Cicely, I happen to know that you two aren't having what you might call an easy time. No, Tommy, we're not. All right. Now, I have, to use the language of my profession, a proposition to make. Why, Mr. Abbott... Wait a minute. Now, you made a good start as an actress. You had to leave the stage. Now it's time for you to go back to it. I can't, Tommy. I have Kit to look after. Don't interrupt me in the middle of a proposition. Now, there are two things you need. Someone to take care of Kit and new clothes so that you can interview managers. I'd like to lend you money for both. Say $300. $300! Yeah, about two weeks' salary after you get started. Oh, Tommy, I'm very grateful to you. But you see, there's Chris... I know. I know. It would hurt Chris' pride. And how could I accept it? Because in things like this, women are more sensible than men. Cicely, I want to help you two kids. I don't care how it's done. (WHIMPERS) What doctor did you take Kit to? It was a public clinic. I don't see any signs of a baby carriage around, unless you've parked it somewhere. You carried him there, didn't you? Yes. I'm sorry to be so brutal, but you've got to make sense. Listen, Tommy, I honestly don't mind things for myself. It's Chris. He works so hard all day long and all night, too, almost. And then he comes home tired out. Yet, somehow, he always manages to run up the steps just to show he's not. My heart breaks for him. Once again, and for as many times as you like, how about it? That's a very attractive proposition, Tommy. But I couldn't think of borrowing from you without paying interest. All right, 8%. I thought 6% was the usual rate. All right, 6%. But listen, I'm going to see Jennings tomorrow morning and get an appointment for you. You take care of the new clothes and beauty parlors. Oh, Tommy, your efficiency is very comforting. Oh, it's mostly an act. Not to be confused with the really important things Chris can do. That's sweet of you, Tommy. You've got to go? Yes. It's time for Kit's nap. Well, let me carry him. What'll you do with your cane? Well, you carry it. Then we'll both look as ridiculous as possible. All right. You look very silly. What do you mean "look very silly"? Let me do that, miss. Thank you. Don't scratch it. No, ma'am, I won't. Thank you so much. Thank you. Hannah, has Mr. Tyler come in yet? Yes, ma'am, he's come in. He come in about an hour ago, but he went out again. Where did he go? Him and the baby went to the park. Ain't you gonna take the paper off that baby wagon? And get it scratched before my baby sees it? I should think not. (LAUGHING) (WHIMPERING) Hello. Hello. Is that your baby? Yeah. Where's his mother? Why, she's out doing errands. What is she doing? She's out doing errands. Hasn't he got any nurse? No. Oh. It must not be much of a baby. (INAUDIBLE) The carriage awaits, my lords. Well, Cicely, who gave you... Here let me take the baby while you take the paper off. Hello! Kit, look! See! Look, isn't it lovely? They had one with four-wheel brakes, but I think he'll like this one. Oh, this is elegant, all right. Here, get his legs covered up. There. Let's sit down. Hello. Where did you... You got a new hat. You got a new suit. Where did I get the money? Yeah. Well, I just got an advance on my salary. Huh? You see, last week Tommy took me to see Michael Jennings, and today he gave me a six-months' contract. Six-months' contract? Well, that's better than you had before, though, isn't it? I mean, a six-months' contract... Look, here it is. $150 a week. Yes. It is fantastic, isn't it? Chris, darling, don't you see what it means? We can get a full-time nurse for Kit and pay Madame Donato all the back rent. It just about came in time, didn't it? When do you start? Next week. Next week, huh? Oh, that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you. Chris, it's wonderful for both of us. You're doing what you wanted to do. That's all that counts. I'm going to get a drink of water. Darling, you remember that circus job I told you about? Yes. I'm going to take it. Chris, you can't do that. Publicity man for a circus. Not after all the things that you've done. It'll pay the rent and a nurse for Kit. But you don't have to do that now. You can wait. Well, I've waited long enough. I'm tired of feeling ashamed of myself. Oh, Chris! I've been a flop as a husband and a father. I'm just stuck on myself because I used to be a foreign correspondent. Darling, please don't take the circus job now. I've got to. I just can't talk about it anymore. I've got to do something! Goodbye. I'll see you tonight. Mrs. Tyler, Mr. Carteret can see you now. Thank you. MAN: Boy! Is this Mrs. Tyler? Yes. Step right in. Thank you. How do you do? Where's that bicarbonate? Left drawer, left-hand side. Left drawer, left-hand side. Left drawer. Why didn't you say so? Sit down, Mrs. Tyler. Where's a spoon? Left drawer... Never mind. Yes, Mrs. Tyler. Go on. I came to talk to you about my husband. Huh? (PHONE RINGING) Hello. What? No. No. Why? Oh, no. No. Goodbye. Yes, Mrs. Tyler, go on. I don't think you quite understand what really happened in Rome. Mr. Tyler didn't... What the... GRAYSON: Yes, Mr. Carteret. What's the idea of monkeying that Murphy story? I thought... I don't care what you thought. Now get a hold of Murphy and have him do it over the way I said. (INTERCOM BUZZING) Yes, Mr. Carteret. Mr. Carteret, are you trying to impress me with how busy you are? Or are you just naturally rude? Sorry, Mrs. Tyler, but I am busy and besides, I've got a stomachache. Do you know that the night your husband left our office in Rome, there was an attempted assassination? Now, suppose it had been successful? That would have been dreadful, wouldn't it? Or I might have died when my baby was born and Chris still in Rome. But neither of those things happened. And in the meantime, a good newspaperman is eating his heart out, and you're doing without somebody you need. When I send a man halfway across the world to keep his eyes open for me, I want a man that I can trust. Mr. Carteret, didn't you ever make a mistake? Didn't you just once do something that wasn't quite in the line of duty? And didn't anyone ever give you a second chance? We don't run newspapers on second chances. Mrs. Tyler, I realize this must have made things difficult financially for you and your husband. Now, it's unfortunate. Financially? Oh, I don't think you quite understand. That isn't why I'm here. Well, I'd heard Tyler was with the City News Bureau. Naturally, I thought that he... Well, why did you come then? Because I want Chris to be doing the thing he's meant for. That's a promise I made to myself. All the newspapermen's wives I've known wanted their husbands to get out of the business. It's his life, Mr. Carteret. You really want your husband to be a newspaperman? So long as that's what he wants. What's his number? Chelsea 7883. Get me Chelsea 7883. How about Russia? Russia? Yes. Russia, Siberia, the Far East. If he sticks at it this time, he'll get everything he ever hoped for. (PHONE RINGING) There'll be months when he's off in the interior. You won't even hear from him. Want me to forget it? No. And he will stick at it. I won't do anything to bring him back this time. Well, you asked for it. Hello. Tyler? Frank Carteret. How's your Russian? You'll have time enough to learn it. We've lost Delaney in Moscow. I have to have someone to take his place right away. Just a moment. He says he'll have to talk it over with his wife. Tell him to talk it over with his wife. Well, do that. Only you'll have to let me know by tomorrow. Come down any time after 6:00. We'll take care of the passport. Bye. Thank you, Mr. Carteret. Goodbye. Just a moment. Wait a minute. I have a fitting at Madame Bonnet's, and I promised an interview with The Stage magazine. And I simply must finish packing and moving into my new apartment. You know, it wouldn't hurt me to rush around a little less, only... Only, you like to be busy. Yes. Michael darling, come on now, do me a favor. Have your secretary call off that interview. All right. Thank you. See you at 21. At 5:30. (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) (CLEARS THROAT) "My dear Cicely, I couldn't wait. I had an..." Let's see. How many "P's" in "appointment"? Two. Sorry, Tommy, I couldn't get away. Yeah, looks as if you didn't need my help anyway. No, thank you. I'm practically packed. By the way, Madame Donato just brought up some mail. Yes? It's on the mantle. Oh. It's a letter from Chris. Does he know you're finally moving? No. Why are you, anyway? What's the matter with the house in Connecticut? It's all right for weekends and for Kit. But when I'm in town, it's just so inconvenient. There's no place to entertain. It took you long enough to discover that. Yes, I know. I think I kept hoping I'd hear Chris come running up the stairs again. Now I want a place of my own with my own things. Any particular news from Chris? Yes. He's coming home in a few weeks. To stay? No. He'll only have a few months till he has to go back. I wonder if he's changed as much as you have. I wonder, too. Well, I'll be going along. So long. Goodbye, Tommy. (SOBBING) Cicely. Something is wrong? Madame Donato, what's happened to me? I should be happy, and instead I'm frightened. But why, Cicely? Chris must have learned to live alone, too. Living alone or living together. That's not important for you and Christopher. I don't feel married to him anymore. But that shouldn't make any difference to you, either. There have been whole days lately when I haven't thought of Chris once. That's a strange kind of love. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) I'll go. MADAME DONATO: Oh, come in. Everything is ready. MAN: Yes, ma'am. Pick up that trunk over there. (FOGHORN BLOWING) And the people live farther up the river. Have you a home there, too? Well, I did have. Did have? Has it been destroyed? No. My wife gave up our apartment. Your wife gave up your home? Well, she wanted another place. Something bigger. Well, Chien, I must go finish packing. My grateful thanks for your kindness during the voyage. Thank you. I hope you get along all right at Columbia. Goodbye. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hello, Michael. Yes, I've read it. Well, it's not quite the great American play, but I like it. But, Michael, you already have one play for me. (WHISPERS) Michael, I can't talk to you now. Hello, Chris. Hello, Cicely. Go ahead. Oh, I'm so sorry. Michael, listen, I can't talk to you now. There's someone here. No. It's my husband. Please excuse me, it was my manager. You are looking very well. You are, too. Better than I've ever seen you. Oh, well, how's Kit? He's fine. He's much bigger than you'd imagine. He's in the country now. Yes. Tommy told me you'd taken a house in Connecticut, too. Yes. Just for the summer for Kit. It's very pleasant there. We're next to a friend of mine. Won't you sit down here? It's the most comfortable place. Madame Donato always settles herself there. Oh, Madame Donato. How is she? I must call her. About the same. Maybe a little fatter. Is she? Tommy met me at the boat. Yes. He told me he was going to meet you. Yes. He told me that he told you he would. (CHUCKLES) I have some cocktails ready. Do you think it's too early for them? No. I think that would be a great help to both of us. May I help? Yes. You can get the ice. Wow, this is the first one of those things I've seen outside of a magazine. The ice is in those trays. Now what do I do? Pour hot water over it. (LAUGHS) Look what you've done! I used to do all right with an ice pick. Cicely. Oh, Christopher, you've been gone such a long time. Hand me the shaker, please. Cicely, I'm sorry I upset you. Oh, I'm all right now. Come on. Let's have our drinks in here. Beautiful place. Thank you. I've just moved in. You know, I'm surprised you didn't leave Madame Donato's long ago. I couldn't quite get up the courage. Besides, every time I even mentioned it, Madame Donato practically had a fit. Sounds like her. Here you are. Thank you. Chris, how would you like to drive down and see Kit? I certainly would. It isn't far and I think you'd love the place. Kit could show you his pony. What? Kit on a pony? Yes. He goes riding every morning. You could stay and... Of course, if you have any other plans, it might interfere. Well, I had planned to see Carteret in the morning. Perhaps there is a train I can get back tonight. Yes. There's one that gets you in at 11:00. That'll be fine. Cicely, I have been away a long time. But there's one thing that may make our meeting again a little less difficult. I want you to know that... Naturally, I realized that you've been living your own life, and, well, I want you to know that I realize that. But what I'm trying to say is that I don't want you to feel that I expect anything of you. That's very fair of you. I don't want you to feel that I expect anything of you, either. I'll get my coat. Good brandy. You know, from that last story of yours, I thought the war had already started. Oh, no. There won't be any real fighting till winter. You see, the Japanese have to wait until the roads freeze over. But, Cicely, what about you? Me? Oh, I've had a very good winter. Very busy. My show just closed last week. No. I mean you. I've had Kit. Is that enough? Well, it was something to live for. If it hadn't been for Kit, I don't know that I would have been altogether faithful to your memory. You know, I'd made up my mind I wasn't going to ask you that. I was never so glad to hear anything in my life. Was that what you were thinking of all afternoon when we were being so very reasonable? Some such thing. Well, I guess I'd better hurry if I'm going to catch that train. Cicely, I wonder if... You know, I'd like to see Kit once more. Certainly. Come on. (BELL TOLLING) Oh, this is nice. CICELY: That's my room. Do you think it will wake him if I kiss him goodbye? It doesn't matter. Good night. I guess he thought it was you. No. He knows you by now. I'm sorry I can't send you back in the car, but it's William's night off. That's all right. I am pretty used to trains. Yes, I know. I'll be in town in a few days. It'll be fun showing you all the new places. I'll look forward to that. You'll call me tomorrow, then? Yes. I'd better hurry or I'll miss that train. Chris, what would happen if you didn't take that train? (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) ...that he expected... (SPEAKING FRENCH) Mother, I thought you told me this morning Daddy didn't know where he was going? (SPEAKING FRENCH) But I don't know the word for "expected." Mother, what time is Tommy coming? Kit, if you don't pay attention to Professor Dindet, you're never going to learn enough French to be able to be a foreign correspondent. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) Good. I'm afraid we were both very bad pupils today, Professor. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) Goodbye. I saw a car down the road, but it wasn't Tommy. Come here to me, young man. What's the matter with you today? You weren't very nice to the Professor. I'm sorry, Mother. Mother? Hmm? Where is Daddy going next? He isn't quite sure, darling. Oh. Didn't he say in that letter you got from him this morning? No. There's Tommy. Hello, Tommy. Hello, Kit. How are you? Gee, I thought you were never coming. Did you? Hello, Tommy. Hello, Cicely. Did you find out about that lasso? Lasso? You said you were going to find out where I could get a horse-hair lasso. Darling, you can wait till you get to California for that. But I need one to practice with. It's only 26, I mean 27 days till I go to Tommy's ranch. The minute I get off the plane in California I'll see about it. When will that be? Well, I leave tonight at 9:00 from Newark, and it takes 18 hours. Oh, gee, that means I'll have to wait a whole day more. There's the younger generation for you. But be sure it's a horse-hair lasso. That's the only kind rattlesnakes won't crawl over. Darling, you've got to get ready for your supper. Yes, Mother. Hurry now. It's late. Yes. How about my hat? (GIGGLES) I'm almost as excited about your ranch as Kit is. Well, you could see it with him if you'd come to California and do that picture they want you for. No. No Hollywood for me this summer, I'm afraid. Is it a real ranch? Well, don't tell Kit, but I grow asparagus on it. Are you ready to go? No, I have to get dressed. I won't be long. Had a letter from Chris this morning. Did you? (WHISTLING) (DOORBELL BUZZING) Good evening, Mrs. Tyler. Mr. Abbott. Good evening, George. Everything packed, George? Yes, sir. Well, look, you better get a car around here in a couple of hours. But it takes an hour and a quarter to get to the airport, sir. Well, make it an hour. Yes, sir. Oh, I like it better here. It was so noisy at Pierre's. Want a brandy? No, thank you. Tommy, what is this? Well, it's a remote control to that radio. Very handy, too, when you can't get away from the bar. (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) You've managed to surround yourself with more gadgets. Well, I guess it's the same reason that I keep this apartment in New York. Something to do with my money. What about that beautiful blond? Oh, you've been reading Winchell, huh? Mmm-hmm. That the same one I met in California last summer? Mmm-hmm. Yes, she's very nice. Well, was Winchell right? What? About my marrying her? Mmm-hmm. We've talked about it. Yes. Chris wrote me that he thought he might go to Switzerland. Are you going to join him? I don't know. It depends on whether I open my play in the fall or in the summer. Yeah. It's pretty funny about his resigning from his job. Unless he feels he's done everything he started out to do. He's come a long way, hasn't he? Yes, he has. What's this book he's going to write? Did he tell you about it? Yeah. I don't know. He always said he'd never write a book. Tell me more about your beautiful blond. What's her name? Her name's Elaine. Elaine Martin. Are you in love with her? Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a love match. We just like each other. It might work out. What are you waiting for? You. Tommy. Yeah, I know. Even after nine years, it may sound a little sudden. Would you divorce Christopher and marry me? Because we just like each other, like you and Elaine? No, it isn't quite the same. At least with me. You see, I happen to be in love with you. I didn't know, Tommy. I didn't intend you should, but I've been in love with you ever since... Ever since I can remember. I always took everything you did for me for granted. The money you lent me when I was a shabby little girl and didn't have enough to buy a baby carriage. All the thousands of little kindnesses. I never thought of you at all, except as someone I could turn to. It wasn't very nice of me, was it? You always loved Christopher. Do you still? Yes. I know you do, even if he would rather write a book than come back to you. How many times have you two been together in the last four years since you came back from China? Once in Paris. Two weeks in Saint Anton. Four times altogether. But never for very long. Since China there was always either my work or his. What's in the way now except the book? Evidently, he doesn't want to see me. Well, then will you, Cicely? Marry you? Yes. Tommy, you make me very proud. Perhaps we could be happy together. Only... Even that much coming from you makes me feel happier than I know what to do about. Well, I suppose I... (MUSIC STOPS PLAYING) (TUNING RADIO) Just another gadget. MAN ON RADIO: And now, friends, as we go back through the years, see if you can remember this one, the hit of 1926. (MUSIC PLAYING) Music by request. Tommy, let's sit down. Chris has asked me if I wanted a divorce. He's done and said everything he could to tell me he doesn't love me anymore. Still, I feel I must wait. I don't know what for, but I must wait, Tommy. No matter how Ionely I am. MAN ON RADIO: And now, we give you the hit of 1927. Remember? (MUSIC PLAYING) The night before I was married and thought I was going back to college, they played that piece at the Biltmore. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Hello, Mr. Carteret. Hello, Chris. How do you do, Mr. Tyler? Good evening. Well, Geneva, June 14th, at 8:00. Now let's see. One minute of 8:00. When I got your cable, I felt as though I was right back in the city room receiving one of your assignments. You forget the rest. I said "as a personal favor." I don't think I ever put that in any of my assignments. No. I hear you've resigned as managing editor. Yes, Chris, they gave me a dinner and presented me with a gold watch. Pretty hard to imagine you on a vacation. I'm not. After 30 years, I am, at my own request, back to being a foreign correspondent. Now I can find things out for myself. I think that's marvelous. Where do you begin? I don't know. May go on to Berlin. Like to come with me? Berlin? Yes, I'd like to, but I don't think I can. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Later. Yes, sir. I was almost sure when I got your letter, Christopher. Now that I see you, I am sure. Of what are you going to die? Whatever made you think I was going to die? Your letter of resignation sounded more like a last will and testament. All right then. You see, the germs you find in China are almost as unclassified as the people. They don't even know the name of the ones I've collected. But they do know what they're doing to me. By "they" I suppose you mean the doctors? Yes, I've been to enough of them. Is that why they sent you to Switzerland? Yes, they thought it would prolong things a little. There's nothing much to say, except you've done good work. Several hundred front page stories buried in the files. Yellowing files, Chris. Don't forget the adjective. Thanks for not being sympathetic. How about the famous Cicely Tyler? I haven't told her. Don't you think you'd better? One last wifely gesture wouldn't do her any harm. A wifely gesture is something I've never wanted of Cicely. I had a cable from her this morning. She wants me to meet her in Saint Anton in a month. Saint Anton? Yes. We spent several weeks there together two years ago. Suppose she guesses when she sees you? I'm a pretty good actor myself. Aren't you being a little on the heroic side? No. No. It's not heroism. It's just that we've both known the best of each other. And I want it to end with that still true. I wonder if you have any idea how rarely one finds a couple like you and Cicely. Not just one of you having the courage to live alone, but both of you. Most of the time, there hasn't been much choice. Oh, one of you could have got frightened and hung onto the other's neck and drowned both of you in a sea of matrimonial bliss. That's what usually happens. It's amazing the things people ask of love. They expect it to protect them, keep them from being bored, make them work harder. In fact, they want everything except love. I should be talking of love at my age. But I've seen it so seldom that when I do, I like to stop and warm my hands before it. I remember the first time I met her. There was a look in her eyes when she spoke of you. I'm sorry, Chris. What you and Cicely have together or apart doesn't die out. Now, let's order a bottle of wine and discuss the only proper topic for you and me, the newspaper business. All right. On one condition, that you let me buy the bottle of wine. You know, it was my ambition when I was a cub reporter to know the managing editor well enough to take him out and buy him a drink. Waiter. (GREETING IN GERMAN) How are you, Gottlieb? Fine. Thank you. Mrs. Tyler, it's good to have you back again. We missed you. Otto, it's so nice to be here. Is Mr. Tyler in? Yes, in his room. Yes. Have you got a room for me? Yes, as you requested in your telegram. Thank you. Please. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (RESPONDING IN GERMAN) What number's Mr. Tyler's room? 26. Thank you. Thank you. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Come in. Hello, Cicely. Hello, Chris. You didn't let me know what time you'd get here, or I'd have been downstairs to meet you. I motored up, you know. You're looking marvelously. Thank you. How's Kit? Oh, he's fine. He's staying at Tommy's ranch in California. Well, that ought to be fun for him. Chris, you look terribly tired. Well, I've been working rather hard. On your book? Yes. How's it coming? Oh, it's beginning to shape up. Yes? Tell me about it. Well, it's the novel I swore I'd never write. Well, won't you sit down? I'll get you some tea, something to drink. No, thank you. In your last letter, you asked me if I wanted a divorce. Naturally, you can't go on like this, being half married, half not married. No. I suppose not. Tell me, Chris, it isn't just because of your book that you're staying away, is it? No. No, I didn't think so, but I had to make sure. What is it, Chris? Well, it's rather hard to explain. It's just that one day I realized that I had stopped thinking about you for quite some time. Things like that seem to happen. Well, that seems a fairly complete explanation. Why didn't you write me that in your letter? I thought you would guess. It's peaceful here, isn't it? Yes. I like it much better out of season. How's Tommy? Oh, fine. Is he still in love with you? Yes. Just before I left, he asked me if I wouldn't divorce you and marry him. Do you want to? I'm thinking about it. Might be a very good thing for you after the rotten time you had with me. Chris. Did you ever hear me say I'd had a rotten time with you? Well, we've been happy when we've been together, of course, but that's not enough for a lifetime. It's enough for me. Cigarette? No, thanks. I've given them up. Well, there doesn't seem to be much left to say or much reason for my staying. I could almost be back to Innsbruck in time for dinner. Oh, must you go now? Well, I thought perhaps you'd stay here for dinner. Of course, if you'd rather not... Goodbye, Christopher. Maybe next time we live, we'll have time for each other. I'm being rather stupid, aren't I? I'm making such a tragedy of things. I don't have to go for another three days. Couldn't we just forget everything that's happened and have a very gay and amusing time like old friends? There's so many places here we never saw, Chris, and I've got the car. Let's have a real holiday. First of all, we'll have dinner. I know. We'll go to that little place up the valley where we went the last time. You remember? Yes. Yes, I remember. All right. Call for me about 7:00. Thank you, that's right. By the way, will you give this to Mrs. Tyler please? Yes, Herr Tyler. Shall I send it up to her? No. Give it to her when she comes down for dinner. Goodbye, Otto. Goodbye. Hope to see you back soon. Thank you. Bye-bye. There you are. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Chris. Chris. What is it, Chris? Didn't you get my note? You said you suddenly found you had to go. I tried to explain this afternoon. Yes. You don't love me anymore. I can understand that. But not your running away from me. Chris, you never ran away from anything in your life. Just that I realized that it wouldn't work, that's all. Three days of pretending, it would make us both unhappy. You can't even be my friend? We've gotten beyond that. What is it, Chris? Nothing. You're hiding something from me. It's nothing, I tell you. Chris, this isn't you talking. It isn't. You can't make me believe it. Not even when you tell me you don't love me. I'll never believe that. But, Cicely, I can't explain anymore. I just want to get away. We'll have to say goodbye. Not this way. No. (COUGHING) Oh, Cicely, I can't. I can't. Chris. Chris. In that coat pocket. Tin box. Break them. They're glass. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh, my darling, why didn't I guess? I'll be all right. Are you very sick, Chris? Yes. (BLOWING WHISTLE) (TRAIN CHUGGING) Where are we going? There's a sanitarium I've been staying at near Basel. My darling, tell me. Oh, I love you. I've always loved you.
