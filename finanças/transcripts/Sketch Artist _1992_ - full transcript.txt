Jack and Rayanne aren't here right now. Please leave a message at the beep. -Oh, shit. Jack, it's Milon. Hey, Jack, are you there? We need you right away. It's a homicide on Tommy Silver, you know, the fashion designer. Ask the cheesecake when she gets back. She'll know. Hello? Hi. It's cheesecake. Yeah. Hang on. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing sleeping on the couch? I didn't wanna mess up the bed. It's Milon. I gotta change and take off right away. How was, um, Dallas? Hey, Jack. Jack! Where the hell are you? Jack, are you there? Yeah, Milon. -Shit. Sure there was gas in the car? Yeah, I'm sure. So, are you done? Nope. Didn't think so. Are you just gonna get all over my case right away? Did you mail the rent check? Yes, Ray, I mailed the rent check, I made the car payment, I paid the phone Bill. And I enjoyed my TV dinners every night, thank you. We should be getting pretty close. Silver Fashion. What is that, uh, women's clothing? You know what that is? Huh? - Ray. - What? -What did you say? Watch where you're going. Jesus. - What did you say? - Nothing, nothing. I just... I'm just glad you're home, honey. Oh, I love you, too. I know you're doing your job, but... I'm sorry, ma'am. Nobody gets through. I made an appointment last night... My orders are nobody gets past this yellow line... - Hey, Bill. - Sorry. Where's, uh, where's Silver's? Hey, Jack. It's right up this ramp, take a left, three doors down on the right, can't miss it. Is Tonelli here? Yeah. He's waitin' for ya. Shit. Jack, you know you're late. And you're ugly. I guess we're both fucked. I'm late. Sorry. You're not late, Whitfield, you're hopeless. It looks like a simple robbery shooting, Lieutenant. Receptionist found him just before eight. Now, we got his wife, uh, Krista Silver, said he had a watch, a wedding ring, - and his wallet's missing. - Did she report him missing? No, Lieutenant. All of this for a freakin' dressmaker. He's not shit. Man, my daughters spend half my paycheck on his jeans. At least he went out getting his dick wet. Forensics think he had intercourse before he was iced, Lieutenant. There was semen on his bed. His wife said the last time she saw him was lunch yesterday. She doesn't worry when he doesn't come home at night? They're nighties, Lieutenant. So much for safe sex. What about that messenger? Anything? Well, she got a good look, so she says. Now, Jimmy's driving her back to the precinct. We need you back at the office. I want that sketch right away. - Sure. - So get your job done, okay, Jack? I'm trying to do my job. We got a witness with a finite memory. Let's get 'em while they're hot, okay? Fine, I'll finish this later. Wonderful. Hey, Milon, how about a ride, buddy? Sorry, man, I'm busy here. Hank, what do you say? I'll give you gas money. No, right? I thought so. Fuck it. Ace. Oh, Miss Knoll, this is Jack Whitfield, our composite artist. Jack, this is Daisy. - Hi. - Hi, Daisy. Why don't we go in here? Oh, Jack, wait. Don't forget we need that Atlee file for court tomorrow. Right, right, right, right. What is this? It's a mannequin of a shooting victim. Why don't you have a seat here? Listen, is this gonna take long? 'Cause if I don't get back, I'll get shuttle duty the rest of the day. I'll have you out of here in no time, Daisy. Daisy, that's a pretty name. Pretty name for a pretty girl. Thank you. You want some water or coffee or something? No, I'm fine, thank you. Okay. We'll get right at it. You don't use a computer? Computer? Nah. They draw great, but they don't listen so well. All right. Let's see. So, so you saw... - A woman. - A woman. Well, that narrows it down. Was she young or old? I don't know. I mean, she was young, I guess. She was about 25. No, she was actually more like 27. So you got pretty close. Yeah, she woulda ran right into me if she hadn't looked up. Okay, well, I tell you what, Daisy. I like to start with the hair, so can you describe this woman's hair to me? Um, well, she was obviously a natural brunette, but she had auburn tint. - Okay. - What? No, I just, it's too bad all witnesses aren't women. They always get the hair right, they do. Men, they remember the hairline, but never the color. So, why don't you tell me about this woman's hair? Well, it was sort of short in the back, and like, um... wavy curly on top. Wavy, curly. Kinda like this? Yeah. Mrs. Silver. Glad you could make it. I want to apologize having you come down here like this, after what's happened to your husband. Sit down. It's all right, Lieutenant. I understand. Do you always use colored pencils? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it kinda makes everyone look a little less sinister. How can you just draw hair without a face? Well, why don't you tell me about the face? How was the face? Was it round or was it wide? - Was it... - Sorta normal. I mean, it was normal, but a little angular at the chin. Angular. Like oval? - Yeah. - A little oval. Okay. Like this? Mm-hmm. All right. How about the lips? What do you remember about the lips? The lips. Excuse me. - Sorry. - That's all right. The lips? Um... well, the lower one was fuller and the upper was... ...thinner but sort of turned out. Kinda like this? Yeah, like that. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we're just about finished. Yup, yup. Okay, bye. What about the nose? I don't know. Mind if I smoke? No, no. So the nose was small? Did I say that? No, no I just, uh, it's a question. Was it... was it small? No, I mean, you're right, it wasn't big. It was sort of small and thin. What about the shape? Nice. That doesn't really help, does it? No, was it... was it round or turned up Or maybe... a little pointy like this? Yeah. Yeah... yeah, it was pointy at the tip. Why do the eyes last? The eyes because they can... give you everything back that you wanna put into 'em. They do? Yeah, yeah, you know, you look into somebody's eyes, you can pretty much see everything about that person you wanna see. I know it sounds a little weird, but it works for me. You happen to be in the small majority of people who didn't know how comfortable Tommy felt in an open relationship. He liked to call it an occupational hazard. I assume he meant it to apply to me. I see. Where the hell is Whitfield with that drawing? Jimmy! Is there anything else you remember? Like a scar? She didn't have any scars. Did she have any pimples or freckles or... Maybe, uh... maybe a mole? Yeah. Somewhere in this area? Yeah, I think so. Like, right about here? Yeah, that's right. Are you hot? Is it hot in here? It's getting hot in here. I'm gonna open this window. Okay. Let's, uh, move up to the eyes. Brownish and large. Brownish? What do you mean? Were they brown or not? Brown gray, brown blue? - Brown. - Brown. Brown... And, uh, what about the shape of the eye? - Catty. - Catty. No, I mean, the eye itself. The eye. Well, aren't you the particular one? An eye's an eye, you know what I mean? Yeah. - This? - Yeah, like that. Like, like a cat, catty. How's that? - Yeah. - Yeah. What about the brows? They were sort of... Jimmy's hollering from upstairs, Jack. Tonelli's back, and he's with the wife. Do you mind? Fine. So the eyebrows were full. Yeah, they were full, but they weren't thick. And close to the eyes. Not birdish. Not birdish. Now it's kinda done. No... - Jesus. Did you make a mistake? Is this the woman you saw? Yeah, I guess. Uh, yeah, it looks like her. Can I go now? Huh? - Can I go now? - Yeah, yeah. Daisy. If, uh... if you remember anything else, will you call me? - Yeah. - You'll call me? - Bonnie has your number? - Yes. Bye. The composite, Jack. Want me to write it up for you? No, no, I'll... I'll take care of it. Yeah? No, I'm not... no. You can't rush this shit. I'll be finished in a little while. Can I get you something? - Jimmy! - Right here, Lieutenant. - Coffee and... - I'm fine, thank you. We finally got through to Mr. Korbel in New York City for you. He's on a plane right now. What did you say his relationship with your husband was? Paul manages the business. - Silver Fashions. - Silver Fashion. Fashion, yes. Right here, Lieutenant. Where the fuck... pardon my French, Mrs. Silver, ..is Whitfield? Oh, look, it's the man of the hour. Give me that, okay? Are you sure you wanna work here? This mean anything to you? I've never seen this woman before. You're sure? I had nothing to do with Tommy's business, so therefore, I had little association with my husband's acquaintances, Lieutenant. While she certainly looks like she'd belong in his cavalcade of bedmates, I don't know this woman. So, then, your husband you'd consider to be promiscuous? He liked hookers, Lieutenant. The higher the price, the better. How'd you find this out? He told me. I see. As soon as this Mr. Korbel shows up, I want him to get a look at this sketch, And Jimmy, get copies out to all the blue suits. Right. Now we gotta find this mystery girl. This is where we could put the security system. Let's check the other plan. Hello? Can I talk to Ray? Uh, yeah, she's here. Hold on a sec. - I'll get the plan. - Okay. - Hello? - Hi, it's me. Jack? What's goin' on? I just, um, I just wanted to tell you, I'm glad you're home, honey. Thanks, sweetie. Everything all right? Yeah. Well, I'm really busy here. I'll see you later tonight, okay? Yeah, okay. Bye. Bye. I'm looking for Daisy Knoll? Yeah, she's out back on the loading dock. Hi, Daisy. Now what? Daisy... We were, uh, so rushed this morning, I... I forgot to ask you, uh, to describe this woman's clothing. I don't know, I was so close to her. A dark skirt, gray or black, And a bright orange blouse. A gray skirt? Gray or black and a bright orange blouse. Orange blouse and gray skirt. I already answered all these questions this morning. If... if you remember anything else, Daisy, will you call me? Will you make sure you call me? Yes. Are all cops as much fun as you are? Did you do any shopping? Buy any new clothes? Yeah, right. Like when? I thought I... I thought I saw an orange blouse. No. Helen did. She bought this Armani suit, olive-colored, it was nice. Um, I didn't like the color, but it fit her real good on the hips, and she looked good, but I didn't... I didn't shop. I should shop. I just... I don't like any of my clothes anymore. I'm wiped out. The board should absolutely deny parole to this man. He's still a very sick individual. I want that building. Write it off to the Hudson two budget. Burbank, why are you anywhere? I was talking to Mr. Benchman about his idea, and... What, about the Italian boxer? Yeah, yeah, that's it. I love it! Let me ask you something. How's your social life? It's a question you probably don't get asked too often. But if your social life isn't what you'd like it to be, grab a pencil and write this down. America's Choice Dating Service. -5-2-6-3-3-4-1. What's on the paper could be the answer to what's missing for you. America's Choice Dating Service is an easy and inexpensive way to meet that special person. - Hello? - Hello, Daisy? - Yeah? - This is Jack. - Who? - Whitfield, the sketch artist. What's up? Uh, I got a... I got a little problem here with the sketch, and, um, I need to talk to you, ask you a few questions. Like when? Tomorrow? No, no, tonight. - It's late. - Yeah, I know it's late. But, uh, I can be there in 20 minutes, and I'll be out of there in ten. Hey, you. We're trying to get some sleep here, you know? So shut the fuck up. Our lab boys found pubic hairs other than Silver's on the sheet. More prints than we could ever deal with. Yeah, blind man convention's time, huh? The M.E. should have the autopsy report this afternoon, Lieutenant. Okay, fine. Hey, if I wanted brown socks, I woulda worn them, okay? - Hi. - Can I help you? Yes, please, I'm looking for Mr. Lieutenant Tonelli. - Who are you? - I'm Mr. Paul Korbel. Jack, Tonelli's looking for you. - Go ahead and follow him. - Oh, shit. - Know what time it is? - Yes, it's, uh, 9:30. -Come in. Jack. Who's this? I'm Mr. Paul Korbel. Mr. Korbel, glad you could make it. I'm sorry you have to be here under these kind of circumstances. Comes in waves, Lieutenant. We are all shattered. Sit down. Make yourself at home. Jack, will you sign these affidavits from Carruther's? I want you to look at something. Have you ever seen this woman before, Mr. Korbel? I believe so, yes. Where? Can you tell us who she is? Uh, I can't be certain, but I think she's been doing some photography work for our company. Would you mind stop smoking? I'm sorry, I can't stand the cigarette. Will you put out the fucking cigarette? I'm sorry, Mr. Korbel, go ahead. I... I'll have to check with some of our art directors. I don't remember her name, but I think it's her. Good. Good, I think we got something here. Just a few more minutes of your time, Mr. Korbel, if you don't mind. - No problem. - Here you are, kid. Jack, what do you need, a written invitation? It's one of those days around here. Sorry, Mr. Korbel. You've been very helpful about this. All right. Hey. I'll catch you in the parking lot. What do you say we get a couple of beers after work tonight? - Yeah, Brandelli's? - Yeah, great. Who is she? I don't know. Korbel's man is still in New York until the ninth. Me and Mr. Personality here are on our way over to Silver's Fashions to pick up some employment records, so I'll catch you later. - Yeah. - So, what's up, Picasso? Not much, Gene. What's goin' on? Is it Rayanne? I didn't say anything to make trouble for you, did I? No, I just, uh... wish she was around a little more. Well, she ain't gonna quit her job. - I can tell you that right now. She's got high standards. And you did, too, man. Yeah, right. You know, you got a good thing. Hang on to it. I think I'm losing her. Yeah... I am. 'Cause we don't... talk anymore. We're just driftin' apart. When she's away, I have this... this need to... to talk to her, and when she's here, I can't. I mean, we talk, but we don't talk about us, you know what I mean? And you know what's weird? She knows we're driftin' apart. And it's like, she doesn't even give a shit. She's so obsessed with her little world... of decorating and all that bullshit. It's... I mean, I'm lucky if I can even touch her right now. Now, what you need to do is just go on home and have it out, 'cause otherwise, this thing is just gonna mess you up. - Hi, Jack. - What's happenin'? You know everyone, don't you? Except Todd. Hey, Jack. - I hope we're not too much of an intrusion. - No, no. Here, eat some of this before I inhale the whole dip. Come here, guys. - Let's ask Jack, then. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me ask you a question. If we put a gun to your head, made you choose one of these for your office, what are you gonna do? I'd tell you to shoot. - That's what I expected. Having a little party? I tried to call. They've pulled back our deadline. - You mad? - No, no, I'm not mad. Who's, uh, the weightlifter you got? Oh, only my eleventh lover this month. It's a joke. How long are they gonna be here? Uh, I don't know. Do you want a drink? No, I don't want a drink, Ray. And I don't wanna look at wallpaper. I don't even wanna look at those people. I just wanna talk to you a little bit. Jack... Come on! You have guests in here! I can't deal with this shit. I don't blame you, okay? I'm sorry. Yeah, it sucks. It doesn't suck. It doesn't suck at all. We never entertain people. It's a nice change to have people over. It'd be a nice change if you and I could just spend a little time and talk about a few things, like us. It's always what you want, never what I want. What do you want? - Tell me, what do you want? - Oh, cute. Ask me something deep while I got a house full of people? I'll tell you what I want. I wanna party and laugh tonight, okay? Are you coming? You should change. Your shirt. She looks just like your sketch. Nice job, Whitfield. Who is she? Jane Olson, photographer, just like Korbel said. She's doing a layout for Silver Fashions. Did she know Tommy Silver? He hired her, personally. See, Lieutenant? He's good for something. Yeah, but don't let it go to your head, okay, Jack? Miss Olson, how are you? We have an eyewitness who claims to have seen you at Silver's the night he was murdered. Well, he's wrong. It might help if you can tell us how you spent Wednesday evening, where you were and who you were with? Um, I was at my apartment working. Can anyone vouch for you? I mean, at your apartment. Someone you might have talked to that night. Who hired you to work for Silver Fashion, Jane? I... I was hired at the, uh, suggestion of Mr. Silver. So you knew Tommy, and as a favor, he hired you? Is that an accurate assessment? No, that's not an accurate assessment. What is? He saw my work and requested me. Fine. So you did meet? Yeah, we met once. - Did you sleep with him? - Oh, Jesus. No, I did not sleep with him. I don't get in the habit of sleeping with people who admire my work, all right? Would you be willing to cooperate in providing us with some form of physical evidence? What kind of physical evidence? Well, we'd need a pubic hair. Miss Olson? Yeah? Listen, I told them I'd find my own attorney. I'm not a lawyer, I'm just another person on the case. Good-bye. I'm not here to get a confession out of you. Well, then what is it that you want? Have they brought charges against you? No. Well, then they can't hold you. Where have I seen you before? I don't know. I just want you to know if they haven't filed charges, they can't keep you here. If you say you're innocent. So why don't you just give 'em what they want? They'll get a court order and get it anyway. So just do it, and you can get out of here. You areinnocent. This car's got two blown head gaskets, Jack. It's gonna take me about a week to fix it. A week? Sorry, Jack. Shit, why don't you just blow it up, Larry? I was going through Silver fashion papers this morning. How long you say your wife's been with CMC? About three and a half years. Why? I thought that's what you said. Her outfit had major billings with Silver's Company. Summer of '90 through spring of '91. I wonder if Rayanne ever got to meet him, not that it'll help any. Jack, what a surprise. How you doin', man? Don't draw me. Hi. What are you doing here? Uh... isn't this Silver fashions? Yup, that's Silver fashion, all righty. You didn't tell me you worked on that. - I didn't? - No. You didn't ask me. Did you know him? - Who? - Silver. Yeah. He had very specific ideas about what he wanted. It's too bad about him. Yeah. Yeah, it's too bad. Well, you wanna get some lunch? Oh, Jack, that's so sweet, but I can't. I'm so busy today. All right. Jack, hey. Good to see you again. - Hey, Ted. - It's Todd. -Oh, Todd, right. I'm sorry. -It's okay. Listen, Ray, we really need to get going and take a look at those changes. Okay. So, whenever you're ready. Yeah. Uh, I promise we'll have a great dinner. Yeah, I'll get out of here. I know you're busy. - See you later. - Okay. Bye. Whitfield, what's up? What are you doing here? Tonelli, he wants me to finish the floor plan. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Well, uh, I gotta get something to eat. There's a snack shop on the corner. You want something? No, no, I'm fine. Eh, Moran, how many burgers you want, huh? Don't fuck with me, you know, I'm on a diet. Don't fuck with anything, Jack. We're not done yet. What is he doing here? Oh, something about Tonelli wants a floor plan. I'm finished. Jimmy didn't tell me you were gonna be here today. -He didn't? - Yeah, yeah, - Hold on. Oh, shit, I forgot to get it cleared. Sorry. Call is for you. Yeah. Oh, yeah? Where? What time? Hey, Jack. Not in here, all right? He's here. How do I know? Done. Let's go. We got a corpse over in the L.A. river. You know, Tonelli's pissed. He wanna know what you were doing up in Silver's suite. What do you mean, what was I doing there? I'm trying to do my job. You saw him, he threw me out after five minutes the other day. Hold this, will you, Milon? Jesus! Every time I try to do my job, that bald little son of a bitch jams me. Oh, well, no, it'll be okay. Yeah, you just let me worry about Tonelli, all right, Milon? Okay. ...Los Angeles river, Westside on 6th street branch. Coroner confirms victim is female Caucasian, early 20's. No further backup... - Go ahead. - I got it, no problem. Hey! That's my fuckin' lighter! What are you, nuts? Sorry. I'll give you the lighter from my car. What's this? Earring. they found it in Silver's suite. - They found this earring in Silver's suite? Yeah. that's what I said. In Silver's suite. They did? Yeah! Hmm. Jack. there you are. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm... I'm gonna go home early, though. No, you can't. they need you in there. They got a new witness. Hey! That's him. That's the guy I saw last night. Yeah? He works here. I'm telling you, this is the guy I saw going into Daisy's apartment. What were you doing at her apartment, Jack? Milon, I was rushed on the drawing, and so was she. I thought of something that might help her remember, so I... Listen, since when is it a crime to try to do your job? It's not cool... Why don't you shut up! Okay, okay, okay. Just go home for now. I'll take care of Tonelli. Uh! you scared me. What's goin' on? Had a long day with Todd? You scared the shit out of me. Did you do that? Huh? Where are the earrings I bought you, Ray? Is that what this is about? Where the fuck are those earrings? I lost them. If I'd known you would've gotten this upset about it, I would've replaced them. - When? - When what? When did you lose 'em? Three weeks ago. Where did you lose 'em, Ray? I don't know. The health club, maybe? How come you never told me you worked for Silver? - You knew he was murdered. - Jack. What do you expect me to do? You resent me working, and I'm gonna come home and talk to you about it? Were you there? Where? At Silver's, the night he was murdered. What? I know you were there, Ray. How long you been dreaming this up, Jack? What? Why were you there, ray? Just tell me. Jack, I was in Dallas, remember? You're losing it. Jack, entirely losing it. Ray, there was a witness that ID'd you. She described you to me, I drew you. And now that witness is dead. No. No, Jack. You... you saw me. You did. No... it was... it was you that she described, Ray. She described things about... Just fucking tell me what's going on. Jack, you drew me. You did. Like you've done a hundred times before. Don't you understand what's happening? Ray, just tell me what the fuck is going on, all right? No, if you'd just... if you'd just explain it, I'll understand. Just tell me what happened. Just fucking tell me. I don't know what's going on. Would you just explain it to me? Jack, Jack, Jack, it's okay. Listen to me, Jack. It's gonna be all right. You gotta listen to what you're saying. You gotta listen to... listen, it's gonna be all right. I had no idea you were under this kind of stress. Please... You gotta believe me, Jack. Jack... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not home right now. If you'd like to leave a message or contact me through the escort agency, please do so. Hello? Hello. Pick up the phone, please. Hello? - Hey! my ride's here. - How ya doin', Jack? What's up? Want some cranberry juice? Good for your kidneys. Where's Rayanne? She went to work. - Tonelli wants to see you. - Oh, yeah? -Well, we should talk. Go ahead, I'm listening. - I gotta take you in, Jack. - What? I gotta take you in. Take me in? what are you talking about, Milon, "take me in"? Tonelli wanted to send a blue suit. I had to beg him to let me do this. -So give me a break, okay? Give you a break? You're here to fucking arrest me, And you want me to give you a break? Look, we got that autopsy report back on that messenger girl. Now, the same weapon used on her was used on Silver. When Tonelli heard the old man ID you, he went through the roof. Hey! That old Greek rump ranger just saw me knock on the door, Milon. I never even got in that place. Why did you have to go back there that night, Jack? I already told you that, dammit! We talked to her dispatcher. Now, we know you met her on the job. How many times are you gonna forget something? Aw, man. Milon, it's me, your buddy Jack. Remember? Look, they found skin samples and blood under the girl's fingernails. So what? The skin sample was from a man. So what? They released the photographer. You got a cat now, Jack? Oh, man. I don't believe I'm hearing this, Milon. They got your blood type from your employment record. And it matched, right? Big fucking deal! So does a million other poor slobs in this filthy city, Milon! I know how you feel about Rayanne. And how she met Silver when he hired her firm. Maybe they just... Look, I don't know. Maybe we should just go and try to work this thing all out, 'cause it just don't look right. You guys really think I did it, don't you? - Aw, Jack... - No, no, wait, wait. Now, let me figure out. How do you guys think it went down? First I kill Silver, and then I go and I kill a perfectly good witness, right? I might be a fuck-up, Milon, but I'm not brain damaged. Jesus! Tonelli thinks the girl knew something. The girl did know something. She saw someone, and she came to me and described her. She saw someone, yeah, but who? - Now you just might have tried to kill... - Wait a second, Milon! Do you hear what you're saying? Now, I know you're no Sherlock Holmes, but you're not blind, either. Why don't you open your eyes and look what's happening here? - I'm being set up! - Oh, Jack. No, wait, do you really think I did it, Milon? No, I didn't say that. I mean, Jack, look, why you putting me on the spot? Why you doing this to me, man? You're my brother. So don't turn on me, okay? Milon, you're the one who told me that I had a good thing and I had to hold on to it, I had to do anything I could to hold on to it, to make it work. Isn't that what you told me? Well, that's what I'm trying to do here. I just need a little time, and I'll figure this whole thing out, all right? All right? Thanks. I need a ride. I'm fucked. You know, this is completely wrong. Completely wrong! -Here. What's this? I hope this is the number of a travel agent. Travel light. I just need you to run a reverse directory on this number, okay? Can you do that for me, Milon? Say what? All right, it's in this area somewhere. Yeah. It's right over here. Hey, Jack... Where are you gonna be while I run this number? I'll be right in here. Give me a couple of hours. You got it. What do you want? I just wanna talk to you. No, no, I think you better just leave, okay? Whoa, ho, ho! Wait a second, I'm not a cop. I'm not, I work for the police department, but I'm not a cop, I'm a... I'm a sketch artist. Witnesses come in and they describe people to me, and I draw them. I drew you. You drew me? Yeah. Have a seat. Thanks. You got another beer? - Sorry, my last one. - Shit. Thanks. -That's good. Here, I got a light. I know you. - You do? - I know who you are. You know more than me. No, no, no. It's um, it's your lighter. My lighter? What about it? At Silver Fashion? That's where I saw you. Your lighter didn't work. My god, you're real. Hmm, what do you want? I just uh... Just wanted to know how well you knew Silver. No, no, no, no. I've already answered all these questions. No, wait a second. Listen, I gotta explain something to ya. I'm in a... I'm in a lot of trouble, all right? And I just... i just wanna... I just need some help. You need help? We're both in the same boat. No, no, no, no. I'm innocent. No, that's what I'm trying to tell ya. I'm innocent, too. I just need a place to stay for a couple of hours, all right? If I can just stay here... You gotta be kidding. No, I'm waitin' for a phone call. - Just a couple hours... - No. just... just go, okay? Get the fuck out of my house. Hello? Um, no, no, nothing. Give me change, will ya? You gotta buy something. I can't give you any change. Just give me some fucking change. -Hey, buddy. -What you got? Hello? Yeah, it's me. Jesus, Jack. you stole her car? I didn't steal it, I just borrowed it. Where are you? No, forget it. I don't wanna know. You got the address? It's 5501 marathon. 5501 Marathon. Hey, Jack, please get rid of that car. - Yeah, don't worry about it. Come on, get out of here, will ya? Hello? Ray, it's me. Jack, the police were just here. What is going on? Don't worry, it's all right. If you're in trouble, I wanna help you. Did you tell 'em about the sketch? Of course not. Do you love me, Ray? You know I do. I love you, too. Anybody home? Hello! Yeah? Uh, is brandy here? No one here by that name. You've got the wrong address. No, wait, wait. this is the address Tommy gave me. - Tommy who? - You know, Tommy Silver. Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hold it, hold it! Listen, I'm a cop. I just wanna ask you a few questions about Tommy Silver. I don't know any Tommy Silver. Shit. If you don't know Tommy Silver, what they hell you running away from me for? I've got outstanding warrants. I don't give a shit about your warrants. -I wanna know about Tommy. I told you. I don't know any Tommy. This look familiar? it's your phone number. I found it at his suite. If you don't know him, what the hell was he doing with your phone number? I don't know. Maybe he was gonna call me. Got my number from the escort agency I work out of. He never called. I never talked to any Tommy Silver in my life. Look, you gonna arrest me, do it. I've got things to do. I see you like rap music. Recognize this? I also found this in Tommy Silver's suite. I figure it's got your fingerprints all over it. I didn't kill Tommy. Why should I? We were friends... good friends. - I mean, he was, like, kind to me, you know? So you were with him more than once? Yeah. I mean, sure, Tommy liked to sample, but like I said, we were friends. We used to talk all the time. That's what we did most of, anyway. Were you with him the other night? Yeah. But he was alive when I left. Do you know if he was expecting anyone else? No. His wife had gone to some celebrity fundraiser with her people. Tommy was wasted. I was gonna spend the night at his suite. He was so tense, I had to perform vadray healing exercises on him to get him to relax. -Vadray healing exercises? It's when you massage around the scrotum and other places. Tommy loved it. Would you mind getting your arm off my sculpture? Thank you. What was Tommy so uptight about? Did he tell you? Said he wanted out. Out of what? Fashion. What else? I gotta side with his business manager on that one. You gotta be crazy to throw that away. I mean, they wear his jeans in Bora Bora, you know. Yeah... - Did Tommy fight with his business manager? - Constantly. What was the guy's name? Paul. - Paul Korbel? - That's the guy. Tommy said he was skimming millions from him, Since he knew he wanted out. Tommy figured he could shakedown Paul at the same time. Scumbag. Did Korbel know that Tommy was thinking about getting rid of him? No. I doubt it. You see, Tommy had this thing. He used to like to, uh, spring secrets on folks. You know what I mean? Milon here. Milon, it's Jack. Hey, fuck, Jack, I told you not to call me here. I need Paul Korbel's address. Hey, man, don't even... Just give me the address, will ya? It's 1898 Farrington Drive. What you got, Jack? I need his blood type, too. Hey, I can't do this. I got a real job investigatin' crime and lawbreakers. And you fit both categories. I gotta go, Jack. -Can I call my lawyer now? Sure. Aah, fuck. Yes? Hey, Korbel, guess where I am. Who's this? I gotta tell you, you got a pretty nice pad here. But I gotta be honest with you, I think your whiskey sucks. If I were you, I would leave before the police arrive. You know they are extremely responsive here. No, I think if you were me, you wouldn't have killed your boss. Not that I haven't considered it. But then again, looking around here, I guess it'd be a pretty tough adjustment to do your shopping at the Gap. You're wasting your time. I was in New York the night Silver was murdered. Hope you don't mind, Paul, but I took the liberty of opening your mail. Fascinating phone bill you got here. Don't you think it sucks that they can charge you a buck for a ten-second phone call? Just long enough to see if the messenger was home, huh? I understand she put up a pretty good fight. You're fucking with the wrong person. No. I think you're fucking with the wrong person. Okay, what is it you want? Well, it seems we're both in a little jam here, but, uh, nothing that money can't fix, right, buddy? Come at the Silver factory, 719 Traction. At midnight. Midnight? I'll be there. -You scared me. What are you doing? -I need your help, Ray. The police are watching the house. I can't go home, and I need my gun. I want you to meet me at this address at 11:45 tonight. I'll explain everything later, all right? Just get the gun and meet me there. Okay. -Hello, Jack. I never had to use it. Why start now? You'll be firing the last shot from this gun. Your self-destructive tendencies finally get the better of you, but more importantly, what did you have in mind for tonight, Jack? You had Tommy killed, didn't you? You should know I was in New York the night my boss... as you call him... was murdered. And what about the messenger? Well, yes, she had to go. Yeah, I guess so. You must've gotten there just before me, huh? Things just seem to naturally work out for you, don't they? Well, I keep hearing that. Tommy just got lazy... He lost his vision. Everyone must have a vision to keep them going in the right direction. Don't you see it's our responsibility to... to protect what we believe in? We really appreciate you for switching, um, the sketch, Jack. Jack, we're just surviving. We'd lost it. You may not believe this, but Paul's a very extraordinary man. You wouldn't understand, but he knows what I need. Oh, I believe it, all right. Paul, this is you. I had to do it for us. You fucked her for us. You fucked Krista for us? I'll explain later. I don't understand, Paul. Why did you fuck Tommy's wife for us? Give me the gun, Ray. Tell me why. It means nothing. Just let it go. No, no. You used me! When was it supposed to be for us, huh? Where was I supposed to fit in this plan? Trust me, everything is worked out. Why? Don't be ridiculous. - Give me the gun - Why? Rayanne, you are completely... I wanted to believe you, Ray. I did, but... It was the earrings, you see. I designed 'em. One of a kind. How did this happen, Ray? Huh? I'm sorry, Jack. I am. Come on, Jack. Give me the gun. It's all over, Ray. I did love you. Just take him to county jail. Uh, sure. we're all clear here. You okay, buddy? Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah. I forgot to give you this. You need a ride? Nope. Thanks.
