Just a minute. Miss? - Yes, sir? - You have other sanitary napkins brand? The bigger one. What, you got it too? Nope, Wanda ask me to buy it for her. Okay, back to your problems. That's easy.

Tell your friends to buy it, okay? Yes, sir. So, this book based on your love experience? Yes, mostly based on my love experience. - Last time you got dumped? - Last time I got dumped.. A year ago. You mean that the girls is weirder than boys? I just feel that.. If a boy got crush on a girl, and hangout with friends he'll act cool. "Hey, I got a crush on a girl." But the girl is weird, they come in a herd... And says to her friends, "I got crush on a boy." And standing together dancing "Tor-Tor," and saying, "Is it true?" So I just.. I feel like.. I can't understand the girls. Thank you, Mr. Dika for your time. Sure. Why are you smiling? No, my gilrfriend sent me very funny picture. Excuse me, may I have your autograph? Sure. But, this is not my book. Just put your signature on it. Thank you. May I take your picture? - Sure. - Excuse me. Take the picture, please? Please make a pose. I see you and Wanda still close.

Just move on, will you? Hello, Honey. Just a minute. I am still with a friend of mine. Are you still remember your saying about soulmate? Yes, I still remember. Sometimes I feel like, who is my soulmate? You must be thinking like that about Wanda, right? That's right. Be honest. Sometimes I feel lonely every Saturday night. You knew about my feelings, right? Yes. Luckily, sometimes at Saturday night you come to comfort me. - Thanks, Kos. - I love you. I love you too, Kos. Anggi, Ingga, dinner. Edgar, dinner! Dika! Hon? Honey.. Wow! My wife is really pretty when preparing for dinner. - I feel like, I want to remarry her. - Don't be like that. Mom, Dad, don't do that in front of us, we may traumatize. Wait, where is Yubita? - Not home yet. - Take lessons. She's going dating. Mom, how many time you date before got married to Daddy? Only a few. Roy, Anas, Andy.. Adam, Ruhut, Hotman.. Sanker.. Only that. Me, when I met with your mom... Your Mom was still young, trully beauty. And all the guy she just said.. No match for me. You just exagerating. I know you want to ask more of side dish, right? When we were going on a date was really different, right? Not like Dika. Too many broke up. - Because I am looking the right one. - If you are still looking for it.. And not finding it, when will you get married? So, when I can see my grand children? Your Mom already asks for grand children. Just go on a date or be more creative. - Just knock out some girl. - Honey! Sorry. Dik, if you can't give us grand children.. At least give us gilrfriend. Find the one that faithful, just like your Daddy. There is another one. Someone wants to film a novel. The royalty will be paid hundreds of million Rupiah. When Brontosaurus Love would be released? I also want it too. If I become their agent, I'll get rich directly. Same as MLM member as Diamond level. You want to gate date again? I can imagine how I'll get dumped by that type of girl. She spoiled, first month too closed, second month more closed... Third month possessive, too temper... And within six month, broke up because too cloesd. Okay, if not.. - How about that one? - That one? Working girl type is usually independent. First month got closed, second and third months not bad.. Fourth and fifth become distant and broke up cause lack of communication. Wow, you unbelievable. I told you already. I'm become expert with this kind of breaking up. Somehow I know when got broke up with these type of girls. That means you need a girl that is different from others. I want a girl that I can't predict how am I gonna get dumped. Okay, because you are looking for a new girlfriend. I'll introduce you to some of my friends. They are different for sure. Just trust me, Kosasih. I'm Dika. You are my type. Oh, yeah? There is no other chair? For what? For Agus. This Agus used to be my favorite turtle. Now I preserve it. So, everything that I care so much.. I will preserve it. That's how I am.

Waiter! Again push! Just push it harder. I told you, your car must be broke down again. I told you to buy a new car. The baby is almost born. That car may need overhaul. Waiter! Oh my God, Dika.. And now that car broke down. Poor girl has to push that car. Oh my God! Push harder! It's so noisy over there. Just push harder, that's it.. Are you crazy?

That's it, this love things for me is over. Waiter, where is my food? I've been waiting. I'm waiting for two hours and I'm starving. Is that my food or not? I'm sorry, sir, please wait in line. Where is the manager, I want to scold that manager. I'm the customer here since long time ago, why you didn't know me? What is this kind of restaurant? - That's similar with black corn fiber. - I'am starving, you know? Why take a long time for food? It's two hours already. - What? - His armpit. - It's like black corn fiber. - Where is the manager. No, it's like black fan. I am afraid his armpit is a live. Like you can talk to it. Yes, armpit, today we go out. "Yes, master." Armpit, today we eat fried rice. "Sure, come on." Stop talking about it, otherwise it will hit you. - Watch out! - You want to try me? It's lucky I hold him for you. Your imagination is too exagerated. You usually talking about armpit unknown people? That depends. I'm Dika. I'm Jessica. - This is your lunch break? - Yes, my office near this place. That's cool. May I ask your number? Am I too agressive? - Yeah. - What do you mean? We already know our name and I thought yours are different. So, you are not... Offering me to buy insurance policy or some kind of MLM? - Not at all. - That some kind? Oh, this is a TV program called candid camera? You're not seeing camera around, right? I don't see it. It's funny. Rilex. I'm not gonna ask you to join with that LMN? MLM. Whatever, I don't know what that is. - Mister, one Ocha, please. - Two, I drink two. Give me three, please. You are funny. Yeah, yeah. - I'm afraid to join with MLM. - Why? I'm afraid fall in love to that MLM lady. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Here for you. - The food that I order? - Yeah. Whos's that? That's uncle Yadi. Our kin. He just came by here. Poor fella, no body take good care of him. No children, no wife. He's too selective with woman. When he's still young.. He got 40 criterias for his future wife. Assalamu'alaikum, uncle. Here, I brought you the first candidate. - Her height is 152 cm. - Nope. He's now 70 years old. And his criteria for future wife decreases to only one. - What's that, mom? - As long as she accept me. Just call Edgar. Gar.. Edgar.. What's wrong with you? Recently, I can't sleep, just like you. - I suffer with amnesia. - That's insomnia. That's what I mean. Why do you got insomnia? I'm falling in love. Falling in love with whom? With my classmate, Yasmin. It's called a puppy love. She's not a puppy. Not that. That doesn't mean you fall in love to a puppy. That's only a little kid love, only for fun. That's called puppy love. What do you think, will Yasmin like me? Let's go downstair. Come here. Come, follow me. Hello, Jessica, this is Dika who speak armpit with you just now. Do you have time tomorrow night? And right now I feel like I am in the middle of Indian movie. - No chicken grilled? - Nope. - What? - Nope. - Pardon me? - No, chicken grilled. I will order this instead. - Haricot de mokong. - No. Haricot de mouton. Hahikho de mukho. Haricot de mouton. Ha.. - That's the one. - Yes. You often came here? This is my first time. Because my agent told me.. A good place to eat. This one? Haricot de mouton. - Okay. - Bon apetite. Yeah. It's look like poop. But, the aroma is good. Now the aroma is looking good. Let me see. Yeah, it's fragrance. Okay, just eat this poop, haricot de mouton. Whatever it is. How about having wine? - Okay, that's good. - Good, right? - Have you drink wine before? - Not yet. Me too. At least this much more comfortable and quiet than that France restaurant. Before I'm thinking to myself... Do I really want to go out with you? I'm tired just to go on a date. Just broke up and back up all over again. - Really tiring. - Me too. Me just think like this.. Or I just become a lesbian? Me too. You also want to become a lesbian? No, no, I mean.. I also think that it's hard to find the right girl and if I met her... The result will be the expired love. This is my opinion. The destined couple is like the stars in here. You are able to see them if the sky is clear. So, the one that destined will appear when the right time is come. Maybe you are not meeting with the right person yet. So, it's like that. Look, it's still cloud there. Rilex, the destined one will come. Yeah? - Are you available next week? - I'm available. - Wanna go with me? - Yes. - Where you want to go? - Anywhere. That's the description, Mr. Dika, thank you all for coming here. Do not forget to buy his book. And do not borrow it. Anyone to get autograph? For the autograph.. Sir, you want the autograph.. Here. - Anyone is looking for me? - Jessica. Called several time. I just told her you are still in a talkshow. - New girl? - Yeah. You two go out? Yeah. How's the France restaurant that I recommended to you? How close are guys? - Yeah. - How is the way to fold this? Already doing this? - You like to poop from nose? - Yeah. Hey, look, there are the producer. They sent assistance, want to speak with you. How to fold this. - Hello, Dika. I'am Rio. - Yeah. - Dika. - You have time? Let's meet the producer. Yes. - Come on! - Yeah. - I'am Dika. - I'am Kosasih. Please, sit down. I.. Really like with... Dinosaur. That's the animal I think really fearsome. I still remember, when I still young... I often got dinosaur doll. From my father. But, in that book there is no dinosaur. No problem. I like the book title. - Brontosaurus Love, right? - Yes, sir. If you want to film it, obviously I'm interested. - We are really glad. - We are also the same. But, have you seen the movie from the first book? - "Kambing Jantan," sir. - Yes, that's the one. I really like that movie. Where is the goat? I don't find it anywhere. That's the story. Next week I'll go to Mr. Soe Lim's office to take care of the contract. That's cool. My feeling is good, hope so. You wrote that book? Yeah, that's from my book. It's about my love experience that failed. Love experience? With the last one too? Nina, yeah. When still dating, they also said.. "Are you eating, if not, you'll get sick." And because of that, I'm not eating and has to stay in a hospital. "I am not staying at the hospital, nurse." And then died? You never care about me. You never care about me! This is the bad timing for singing, because I'm still driving. - You're still driving. - Nevermind, that's what I'm looking for. - Get me down now! - Why? Get me down now. I will get you down over there. Do you really want to get me down? - But, you ask me. - You really want to do that? But.. I.. Girls are always like that when they are in a bad mood. You are also a girl. Yeah, but I'm different. Right? "Honey, me and that female crocodile who is the prettiest?" "You are the prettiest." "Even when you are laying eggs everywhere." Snake. - Don't be afraid, it's just snake. - Okay. You hold it too. - How to do it? - Like this. - Okay. - Just look like the ridiculous kids. - Hi. - Hi. I tell it again to you, Kos. Jessica is really different. She is able to laugh to something that also make me laugh. And maybe for other people that's not funny. We are like two weirdos that at last become together. Finally.. Thanks to God. I'm just happy for you two. Dik, can I borrow money from you? What for? Wanda wants to have luxurious invitation card. - Okay. - Thank you. Dika, Kosasih, please come in. I actually like with the basic idea of this script. But.. You need to improve it. I have a good idea. Indonesian people.. Really like something that is expensive. If we want to make a film, we have to make a high class film. For instance.. Its opening with riding a helicopter. How about the opening I'm just walking in the park? Walking in the park with a chopper. It's simple, right? High class. We make the stories more drama. Indonesian people love heartbreaking drama. In your movie, there are girlfriend, right? Yeah. We make the girlfriend to be pregnant. - You are surprised, right? - I am a bit shock, actually. That's not all. We make the girlfriend being pregnant, you now with whom? - With whom? - With her grandfather. Okay, let's put aside that idea first. Now we are taking care of the important thing. I dare to pay dearly for your title. How much, sir? Think it first. I'll prepare the contract. Next week.. I have a movie premier. Rio. Well, we can continue with that marvelous ideas. I have another idea. So, what do you think? That number sums up. I don't know yet, I'll think it first. I got a bad feeling. You know where to print an invitation with low budget but look luxurious? You never care about me. Jes... Jessica. Jessica. Jessica. Nina? Nina! Nina? Nina? What? What happen? I can't sleep. - I got anemia. - Insomnia. Yeah, that's thing. What's wrong? I'm confused how to make Yasmin to like me. Just show her that you like her. How? Give her the attention. Hold her hand.. or.. Speak to her parents. Meet with her parents? Yes, if you like a girl.. Sooner or later, you have to meet with her parents. So, this is my daughter's boyfriend. Yes, auntie. I'm Dika. So, this is Dika. Yes, auntie, sorry we just met today. It's, okay, no problem. I'm also very busy. A moment, Jessica is getting ready. Yeah. Richard, this is Dika. Want to shake hand? - Dika is human. - Yes, I'm human. No, he doesn't want to shake hand with you. It's okay. I heard that you are.. Archaeologist. What do you mean by that? What, Richard? Who created dinosaur? No, I'm a writer. I have a book called Brontosaurus Love. - Some kind of humorous book. - Brontosaurus book? Why don't you write a motivation book like.. Laskar Pelangi. I can't write "Laskar Brontosaurus", "10 Brontosaurus wants to go to school." Richard is laughing. I just left my boyfriend a moment, he got teased by old lady. Jessica, what are you talking about? Richard also startled. Richard, hey, hey. - Dika, let's go then? - Yes, come. Okay, bye. Bye, mom. Bye. Shake hand again, okay. Your house is really quiet. In here, only three of us. - Only three? - Yes. Your mom, you and your dad. Richard. Oh yeah, Richard. Your mom just like "Si Buta dari Gua Hantu." You are funny. Come on. So, my mom and my dad... They met when they are in the same university. My dad used to ask for a cheat sheet from my mom. This is Yudith, my sister. Hi, Jessica. This is Inga or.. What are you doing? - You.. - You're not funny. Your not funny at all. - You want chicken, Hon? - I bring it for you. This is Ingga or Anggi. This is Anggi or Ingga. From those name. Do not eat that. Blow it first. So.. When you two got married? Married? Yeah, married. I mean marriage. Why do you ask like that? You know why? - You two has to get married soon? - Why? So that your dick is not just used only for peeing. You're correct, Dad. - Daddy! - That the big loss. Your family is different. My Dad and Edgar are a little off. Just different, unique, I never see like them. - But, they are fun, right? - Yes, they are fun. I'd like to see you get along well with your family. I used to think that, boys only has two types. If he's not bastard, then he's gay. You just meet me. - Come. - Yeah. They let go the lady with red dress. Hi, Dik. You, Jessica? - Hi. Jessica. - Kosasih. Why are you dressing like weird Pocahontas? Dika. The girl like boys that wearing something ethnic. Okay, you already has a girlfriend and this is not ethnic but a freak. You are wearing suit everyday, but for this event you wear this? This is important event, gala premier, must be standing out. Yes, because this is important, Kos. You are not arrived. Good evening, everyone. This is.. The best romantic movie that I ever produced. "Pocong Love Suster Ngesot." Why I said the best? You all know.. A good romantic movie.. It has a conflict that hard to solve. Pocong Love Suster Ngesot.. Has a conflict that really deep. Yes? Pocong can not squat and the nurse can not stand. Imagine, how they can kiss? I think this movie will become box office. Oh, yeah. Thank you again. Let's watch it together. Pocong, kiss me. I'm crying two times. Because I remember my mother. You've ever being chased by pocong? My mother just like that nurse. - Mr. Soe. - Yeah. What message that you want to deliver through this movie? I want to deliver that love is able to unite anything. Including two creatures that can not kiss. What's your next project, Mr. Soe? Well, I'm gonna make a movie... Brontosaurus Love. This young man's work, right? That's, right? - That is true, right? - Yes, that is true. Your marriage preparation with Wanda is very fast. You said, if too long, it will be void. This is next week. Hey, take it easy, mister. Do not ever hit my ancestor's heritage. - Not mister, it's papi. - Yes, Papi. - Your ancestor's heritage is not bad. - Hurry up. You are not doing it too? I got no intention to get married, mister. - Not mister, it's papi. - Yes, papi. Not now, but later. - With Jessica. - With Jessica... It's seems like that we will break up too. You will break up too, why? Yesterday you tell me, Jessica is different from other girls. You're not serious with her? Before when still with Nina, I also said that, right? Nina is different from other girls.. But, sooner or later, love is also expired. It's Crazy, your way of love. - You are always a pessimist. - Not pessimist, but real. Where is the headman? I told him after Isya. Looks like he's too much shooting the movie and not following the schedule. I can be your headman. You just got a girlfriend and not good as a headman. Honey! - Yes. No cancel, I'm still waiting. - Is it cancel or what? You wait here. If Wanda get angry, she will become fierce. - It seems the headman will arrive. - Yeah. Yes. I am the headman.

You can't say that, it will bring bad luck. Do you want more? I still have it. Do you still remember the first time we were dating? - Yes, five months a go. - Six months. At that time you said you believe that love can be expired. Still remember it? A little. Would you like to marry me? What? - Marriage is different than dating. - What is the different?

Okay, I trust you. We must.. Just tell it again. I want to buy ice cream. Just tell it again. Why? Jess. Are you sure you want someone like him? From his look, it seems that he doesn't like to take shower. You got to see his family. It seems like will not fit with my family. They already met with your mother? Sort of. Him and Mario has a huge gap. Mario smells good. But him.. I also heard that if he's like that.. - It's true. - No, that's my problem. I never think that way. But he once mentioned it to me... He just does not believe in marriage. He also said that... Love is also expired. That's the typical boys. But, you really love him? Dik. I need to speak something with you. What do you want to speak? Recently, my doubt about you is getting bigger. We can't be together anymore. - So, we.. - We break up. Mr. Dika.. Would you please answer the question? The question from that person. - What is your question? - From where the idea of Brontosaurus Love? From experience, from my little brother toys. And from other things. Yes. Is there any question?

He is really clever when he posed. Look, Richard. What's wrong with Jessi? - No. What's wrong? - Nothing, Mom. What wrong with Jessi, Richard? It seems like she's fighting with Dik. Dika, mom, his name is Dika, not Sidik. We just broke up. What, broke up? Darling.. Richard. Thank God Richard is so happy, and you broke up with him. Don't play to far, darling. Kos, are you sure about this? Girls just need apologize from us. Trust to Kosasih. Girls are maybe angry, resentful, upset. But, they only need one thing from boys. - What? - Got tricked. But, Jessica already told me, she doesn't want to meet me again. Look at me. Listen very carefully to my word. As long as you apologize to her, usually she will apologize back. I already told you. What's that? - Seems like we hit a man. - What? We hit a man? - No, not a man. - Thank God. - But, we hit monkey. - What? Jessi? Jes? This is Jessica's monkey. Richard! This monkey's name is Richard? Wow, that's cool. - His name is cooler than mine. - That's not the problem, Kos. - Richard! - Give it a CPR. It almost died, give it a CPR. Not from far. Put your lip to it's lip and blow. - It almost died. - Richard. - Just hurry. - I know it! Richard! Richard? Richard! Mom! Jes, I came here for.. Because I dumped you, now you kill my little brother. Little brother? Richard! Richard, honey. Richard. Get better soon. Don't ever come to my house again. Are you even aware? We never got along well. Mom dislikes you. Richard also dislikes you. Richard dislikes me? Yes. You know? Our relationship is just expired. I'm really sure, this will become box office movie. Okay, right know we are with the renowned producer, Mr. Soe Lim. To interview him related to his lates movie, Suster Push Up. What is your message for this movie, sir? I only want to show.. That Ngesot movie is outdated. Why not change it to push up? It really is interesting. Plus, that.. Suster Push Up is the strongest.. The most fit dan healthy from other ghost. What is your next movie, sir? I have one movie that's really good. I am looking forward to producing it. The title is, "Hantu Cinta Brontosaurus". Sir, why the title become Hantu Cinta Brontosaurus? Are you kidding me? Hantu Cinta Brontosaurus is a good title. I create that title when I woke up. I'm dreaming about that movie. In full color and Dolby sound. Even, there are trailers coming soon for this movie. That's not the problem, sir. I know what I'm doing, Dika. I already made 39 ghost movies. Ghost movie is booming right now. And I lack of ghost stock. Sir.. - I want out from this project. - Why? Don't you read the contract? The copyright of your book belongs to me. So, I have the right to do anything with this movie. You got that, Dika? Kos! Kos! Kos! - What? - Hantu Cinta Brontosaurus. Hantu Cinta Brontosaurus? Where? No, my movie. Mr. Soe changed the title become Hantu Cinta Brontosaurus. Do not yelling. Or Wanda will wake up. I already told you that... I told you it will become like this. I also didn't know it turns out like this. Just see the bright side. What is the bright side? What is a bright side from my movie that the title is changed into... ... Hantu Cinta Brontosaurus that become low budget movie? At least the title not become Tali Pocong Brontosaurus, right? Even it's Tali Pocong.. Even it's Tali pocong or plasenta.. The movie become like that. Money for our contract is really big. - Wanda wants.. - Wanda.. You should tell your girlfriend, your wife now, that she's so wasteful. Why do you speak like that? Okay, listen. Maybe you are my agent. And maybe you help me a lot. But you're not my friend anymore. You never care about me. Just give that cast for me. Sir, this is about fighting in a car, or delivering a baby? To drop it? Now? - What do you think? - I'm going to die. Hey you! On the roof! Dika! Not afraid getting cold? So, you are from.. I'm just finished eating near this neighborhood. So, I saw your car. And I saw you upstairs, like a broken kite. How are you? Why are you become limping? Like you don't have energy when meeting with your ex after a year breaking up. Okay, fine. How are you today? I heard from my friend, you already have a boyfriend. Yeah, I also heard the same. Where is your boyfriend? There, fill up the gas. I can't speak long with you. If he knows I came to see you, we may get quarrel. You are always get quarrel? Often. He's the type that serious. As you know. I can't stand with person who are really serious. Yeah, and then? It seems like I'm more suitable with you than him. Yeah, and then? - What do you mean? - That's just.. So is it okay for you to date someone who are not as perfect as you want? Imperfect boyfriend. No problem at all. We're not a kid anymore. There is nobody that one hundred percent perfect for us. No love that's not expired, right? So.. The problem is not about perfect or not. But, how we can accept that imperfect... From a person that we love. Honey! Let's go back. I will get going. Bye. Hello, Mom? Okay. We are going home now? Just a moment. People that mourn just a few. Hon, if I die first... - Will you be sad? - Please don't speak like that. What if I die? Will be this quiet? No, God forbid. There is our children, me. It won't be quiet. You are always with me, right? You see Jessica, what is the result? Therefore, choose friend wisely. Richard is also selective when choosing human, right? Yes, mom. Your little brother got crippled all of his life, Jessi. Don't be reckless to choose. What, Richard? Yes, honey. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Yes, Richard. We buy donut and ice cream for your brother. That's my credit card. Why your face is like that? - Yasmin is pregnant. - What? She's pregnant? Sit and focus. What did you do? You said before, if I like a girl.. I should take action. So, I just do that. Taking action is correct, but not knocking off a girl. I didn't know if the result becomes like this. Wait. Tell me how's that happen. So, when we are in cafetaria.. In cafetaria? What if somebody see you? What? So, you kiss her cheek.. That's why she becomes pregnant, right? No! Only kissing a cheek will never get pregnant. - So, Yasmin is not pregnant? - Yeah. When I was a little, just holding hand can make a girl pregnant. - Forget it. - Yasmin did not pregnant? No, Edgar, no! I really care for Yasmin. Care? That's only a puppy love. - I'm not a puppy love. - If not, just answer my question. - Why do you care for her? - So, we need reasons for caring? Dik, Dik! Why are you coming here? I am in a hurry. Wait, the contract is cancelled. Cancelled? Look, if you don't believe me.. I came to Mr. Soe and I said I want to cancel the contract. - He must be angry. - He's no problem, Suster Push Up failed. And Mr. Soe said spooky film is not booming anymore. And he's not too confident with Hantu Cinta Brontosaurus. Are you serious? I also have a gut to say no to Wanda. I don't want always to grant her wish to go shopping. You wake me up. Will you forgive me? Kos! Water, water! Ouch, it hurts. It's hot, hot! Water, water. My junior! So unlucky. I am planning to save friendship, I lost one pants. If higher than this, it will become fatal. I borrowed your mom's towel. It's okay, after this, I will throw it away. Oh my God, almost forgot, I have to go somewhere. - Where? - To settle something. This pants can be fixed again? Put a broidery or flower patch. Or birds theme. The hole is already too many. Please not now! Kosasih is ready for you, don't worry. Why are you coming here? Thanks to you, Richard is now disabled for life. I come here to tell you that my head is not cloudy anymore. Not cloudy anymore? I'm stupid, I thought that love will be expired. Then I am thinking and keep thinking and then I realize. Meaning? I realise that love can be expired, just that. - And? - If we are dating.. There is a quarrel, small fighting, one become a lackey and not sure. - That's it? - Yes, that's it. I want to have a quarrel with you, become your lackey... As long as with you, I want to do that. Do you believe in soulmate? Nope. But I believe.. I was made just for you. That is Dika's explanation about Brontosaurus Love book. Anyone has question? You go first. This is a book about love. According to you, what is the meaning of love? Honestly, I don't understand about love and about a girl. And after I keep thinking, I don't understand about love and girl. But, recently I learn something about love. I just realize when we love someone.. We have to become like a kid. Just act natural. No need to much thinking, finding excuses. Just as simple "I love you." Just that. Sometimes when we love someone, we also need to win their family. And make them as part of your own relationship. Because this is the point to love someone. Of how certain of what we have. And how eager we fight for it. Rilex! Love that we have must be as strong as Brontosaurus. And able to withstand until dead do us apart. This is what I realise. Love must be without any doubt. Only a comfort shared by two people who both know each other.. That we are.. Having each other forever.
