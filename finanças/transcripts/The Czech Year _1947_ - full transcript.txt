In 1947, Jiri Trnka created the film "Spalicek" (Czech Year) from a series of individual short films. During digital restoration, some effects have been left in their original form as evidence of the technologies and approaches to artistic style of the time. Digital processing was done using the original negatives kept at the National Cinema Archives in Prague. For some episodes we have had to use the respective positives. The soundtrack has been restored from of a duplicate of the sound negatives. The film was restored in 2015 at Filmlab, Budapest, under the supervision of the National Cinema Archives, Prague. With the support of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, co-financed by the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic. The project partners are the National Library of Norway, and CESNET.
