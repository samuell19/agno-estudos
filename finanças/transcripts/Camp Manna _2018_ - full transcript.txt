When I was 15 years old, I was forced to go to summer camp. But not just any summer camp. It all started when I had to move in with my relatives that I hardly knew. Life was different with Aunt Sharon and Uncle John. Very different. They were the happiest people I'd ever met, which is kind of a lot to deal with when you're trying to put your life back together. ♪ There is power ♪ ♪ In the precious part of the land ♪ - That's harmony. - That was good, honey. All I wanted to do that summer was sit around and feel sorry for myself. But they had other plans for me. Plans that would ultimately change my life. I used to be depressed all the time. All the time. But then pastor Chip told me all I needed to do was spend more time with my Christian friends, and have we got a surprise for you. - ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ - ♪ Jesus is my friend ♪ - ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ - ♪ I have a friend in Jesus ♪ - ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ - ♪ Jesus is my friend ♪ ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ ♪ I have a friend in Jesus ♪ ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ ♪ Je...

In the off-season, I took a strength and leadership course and there is an exercise that I am dying just... Ah, hey! Pride goes before the fall, counselor.

Everybody, stop! Out... whatever, just... Everybody outside, okay? - Bye, William. - I don't care. That's nice. Out! Let's go. Welcome to Camp Manna. William, wait up. - When did you get a brother, Greg? - Uh, he... he's new. He's adopted. We just got him from Africa. You know, I don't even know how to talk to him. He doesn't speak English. No, thank you. And I said "Hey, Basil, why don't you lose those track shoes" and we'll see you try to run a 400 meter dash?" It's a classic, it's a classic. - Sorry about that, bro. Oh... - Todd. - Come on, we're supposed to forgive one another, right? - Are you joking? I'm not supposed to do anything, because I'm not one of you. - Wait, you're not a... - No, I'm not. A lost soul. He's an angry one. A nonbeliever at camp and this is how you embrace him? Whoa! Where do you think you're going? I should talk to him. If you catch my drift. - When did you get the 17th? - This morning. There's a tattoo artist at Camp Manna. This doesn't concern you, Clayton. Oh, it concerns me, Brad. It concerns me big time. I'm extremely concerned. I happen to know that influencing young minds... isn't exactly one of your talents. I mean, look who they put you in charge of every year. International kickball rejects. Unlike your talents, Clayton. You know, eyebrow movement, singing "Jesus Loves Me" in karaoke, wearing sunglasses inside. Gordo. What are you implying, Glutton-town? Guys! Capture the cross! Yay! Come home with it, baby. Head up to Outlook if you want that cross, buddy. What's up, brother? I wouldn't go that way if I were you. Nothing for 40 miles. We're in the middle of nowhere, man. It's too bad you're leaving. I could use a guy like you and the Regiment. The cabin that tripped me on my face in front of everyone? Oh, come on, man. Todd was just messing around, having a good time, doing what guys do. His name is Todd, what do you expect? Nothing personal. This place might look and feel a lot different to you, but it's the same old stuff. Survival of the fittest. And it's pretty good when you're the man. Like me. I'm the man. I guess I'll never know. Ian, this place sucks because you're stuck with Bradley, okay? The dude is a total goober. Seriously. He just... just sautés in goob sauce all day. Look, stick around, man, and I promise I will find a way to get you into my cabin and I... and I will make this whole experience for you amazing. Is that guy bothering you? Do you need a ride? We're all right. Thanks, though. Let me work my magic, man. I'm gonna look after you. And just remember that with me, all things are possible. It's going to be all right, kid. I like you. I didn't think I did, but I do. Ian! Ian. I've been looking all over for you. - Where have you been? - I needed some air. Well, I just want you to know that I'm glad you're here. You know, we're not as crazy as you think. I don't know, back home, Christians killed me once. Oh, I bet. Our love can be smothering at times. Attention, campus. The fun never ends at Camp Manna. Please, assemble over at Hallelujah Hall. Our God-fearing leader has a special announcement about an opportunity for one lucky counselor. Cujo! Cujo! Cujo! Stop! May I have your attention, please? I wanna share this with you. My name is Jack Cujo Parrish. And in 1968, I was wading through rice patties in a communist country called Vietnam. That's Cujo. He's my spiritual leader, just like I'm yours. I caught a hollow point bullet in my neck. And my neck exploded like a Roman candle on 4th of July. - And I was dead. - I love this story. And then, I was taken by some guides, I call angels, to a place in the spiritual realm, and they're glowing and they're floating all around me, and this light on my left side was mother of pearl and abalone colored, and out of that light came an androgynous voice that spoke to me in thought. And that voice said, "You need to look for help in the spiritual realm." Amen. And that's what I've been doing. And when I came back to life, I created what's called... the God Games. - The what games? - It's a bunch of holy games that we play against the other cabins. It develops leadership, strength. Shush, listen. The final event will be the three leading cabins. And they'll compete in a winner-take-all event. When your cabin is crowned victorious, you will be the winner... of the Purple Cross. I've never won that. And this year's Purple Cross is more important than ever. This year, the counselor who leads his cabin to victory will receive a two year scholarship to Mount Zion University. - I know many of you already attend Mount Zion University. - Yes, I do. - But a two year scholarship means no tuition. - -Oh! And for those of you who don't attend, this will change your life. I'd like to welcome you to... Camp Manna! - ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ - ♪ Jesus is my friend ♪ - Can you believe it? - ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ ♪ I have a friend in Jesus ♪ ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ ♪ Jesus is my friend ♪ ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ ♪ He is like the mountie He always get his man ♪ ♪ And he'll zap you any way he can, zap! ♪ Greetings. Welcome to Clayton's Video Journal. Morning one. Since I got this sweet VHS camera for Christmas, I thought I'd document my time here at Camp Manna. Where I actually matter. This year, you'll be able to witness my journey towards winning the Purple Cross scholarship. Also, there's a new kid at camp this year in need of some grace. I told him I'd get him into my cabin and when I do, number 18 is on the horizon. Grace and peace. Clayton out. Rise and shine, campers. Counselor Matthew here, reminding you that the God Games should not be taken lightly. They're here to embed in biblical knowledge and apocalyptic survival skills. They will challenge you physically... develop mentally and spiritually. Camp glory awaits. If I were you, I'd start training... now. Alright, pick up those knees. Doing good. No ankle turns before the God Games. - Is he serious? - I think my heart is shutting down. It's beating really weird, Bradley. That's the love of Jesus. - Why are we running? - The God Games start tomorrow, and years of yore have taught me they favor the more physically advanced. Years of yore have taught me we blow chunks. You have a day to get rid of a lifetime of Moon Pie and Nutty Butter. Well, there's an eating contest. He's right. This running... we can't run away from ourselves. I'll admit, young William, last year's God Games did have their challenges. Remember to paddle together. Need any advice, man? About paddling. I founded the Mount Zion kayak team. I made these shirts. Alright, disciples, let's go. Let's hurry up. We'll rise up on wings, like eagles. We shall paddle and not grow faint. - ♪ Row, row, row ♪ - Really gotta dig in, guys. Row! You know, um, Ian, I've been thinking about something. Why... why aren't you a Christian? - What do you mean? - Aren't there Christians in Florida? Yeah, tons of them. They're all lunatics. Well, you know, you might regret those words come judgment day. Oh, come on! I can't be the only one who hasn't bought into this crap. Of course you are. You're the only one from Florida, ain't you? What about Mo? How dare you? That's my African brother in Christ. - Uh? - How did you... what? - And you, Gordo? - I said the prayer. - I've been baptized, I'm as pure as a dove, Ian. - -Gordo. A better example for Jesus, please. - Hey! Like this? - Knock it off! Gordo, don't make me turn this around. Stop it! Get off of there, or I'll push you in. What's your problem? You guys okay? Gordo, what were you thinking? I told you to stop, and I am your leader, and you need to listen to me. - I... What? - I can't even look at you right now. Dude needs to meditate. I hope you're referring to a Christian meditation, Gordo? - Sure, Greg. Totally. - Alright. Alright. Attention, campers. Cujo has a special demonstration on this year's final winner-take-all God Game event. Everyone, congregate at the Lake of Galilee for this special occasion. - Blonde chicks will never date an Asian kid. - You think so? It's too much of an educational gap for an American. - Oh my gosh! - What? You're all here... because simple minds need to see a demonstration. I'll present to you the final God Game. The Leap of Faith. Oorah. Are you ready? Leap of faith, let it happen. Oh! Wow! Every cabin has an anchor, and every cabin mate is an anchor. But the most special anchor you've got is invisible, his name is Jesus... What's up, brother? - Did you see that? - What? I... I'm pretty sure that guy just died. Yep. Looks like it. Good thing his soul is right there. How're you so chill about this? I'm a chill dude. Listen up. We're gonna have to fast track you into the Regiment. - It's not done yet? You said you were handling it. - Hey. Ian, these things, they take time, okay? I need you to work with me here, okay? We're on the same team, buddy. Can you meet me tonight at the coast? - What for? - Yo! Beefcake. - Sharing some bro wisdom? - Cool it, Cheese Puff. We're just talking. About how you live at home with your mom? Wow, real low. My mom has MS. - I stay at home, so she can live with dignity. - -Oh! Oh, I thought it was because you weren't making your rent working night shifts at the Nut Butter f... Hey, what your mouth! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! What did you say? Say it again! Fight! Fight! Fight! Relax, Manny! He's with us. Please, watch... Hey! Get off of him. This is not a camp for fighting. This is a camp to learn how to be a better yourself. You don't want to feel my wrath, when I take you on in my own way. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? You guys go to the sweatbox right now. Hey! Go to the sweatbox right now. I've got some serious duck butter. Will you, please, stop doing that? It smells like Burger King onions and hot mayonnaise. You know, legally, I bet you Cujo can't even keep us in here. Yeah, what's up with that guy? He's insane. Yeah, the war, you know. He got his face all jacked up from an RPG that blew out of the train he was deucing in. Yeah, it drove him nuts, it shook his brain around. It's true. He went on a killing spree and the good Lord might forgive... but the ghosts don't. They haunt these cabins. And at night, if you're quiet, you can hear them scream. Happity hey, disciples. What're you doing? I heard about what happened. I wanted to apologize for yelling at you guys down at the lake. I'm sorry. Now that we're all together, it's a perfect time for Devotions. Who knows a good genealogy? My favorite is from the book of Ruth. Uh, this is the line of David. David, who would eventually be the one who was the line in the seat of Jesus, who died for your soul, Ian. And Perez beget Hezron. And Hezron beget Ram. And Ram beget Ab... Ab... Abina... Abinam... minadab? - Boo! - Oh! Oh, what's happening, brother? Reading. Devotions. You into, uh, Song of Solomon yet? There's some great stuff in Chapter four. What do you want? Listen, I was talking to God the other night and he and I both agreed that it might be best for Ian if we did a little... - a little... - I s... I see what you're doing. - You want him for his size, for th... for the Leap of Faith! - Oh! You think... - You... - I'm... You thin... I'm offended! - I am offended, you think I'm that shallow. - Yes, I do. Look, I'll trade you Jerry. Jerry for Ian. - No. - Jerry and Todd... - Stop. No. Just stop it! -...for Ian. No? That's a great deal. - I wouldn't have even said yes if you had accepted that deal. - Cujo... - Trade... - Stop! Stop. Clearly Cujo made a mistake putting him in your cabin, the kid isn't connecting with you. I'm just saying, a change of venue, maybe some fresh faces around him, might open him up a little bit. - Oh, wait, I see what you're... - Are you running away? I know what you're doing, Clayton. - No, you don't. - Yes, I can break through to him and that boy belongs to me an... And so does that scholarship. Oh, yeah? Why don't you pray about it - at the prayer fire? - Maybe I will! Change of plan. So, I was gonna talk to the Brad Hatter solo style earlier, but I think we should do it together, you and me. Do what together? Tell him you wanna be in my cabin, not his. Don't you think that will hurt his feelings? Nah, once he realizes how much more you'll get out of this week under my wing, he'll be all about it. I think it might be better if I'm not involved. Come on, you don't wanna be stuck with those guys all year at school, do you? They're like ticks, you gotta flick them off before they embed and never let go. Let's go. A little pep in your step, come on. We don't have all night. Don't have all day. Don't have all day here. Stupid Clayton. He's probably right. I mean, I... I doubt, sometimes I do, I have doubts. Sometimes I have my doubts, you know. Let's turn to the Word. Lamentations III. "I have become the laughingstock of all my people." Oh, come on! All week, I've been laughed at, I've been mocked, and now you? You wanna take part? I'm here every year. And every year I get put with the most unathletic bunch of losers in the camp, every year. That's my cabin. Okay, I'll go one more time, I'll go one more time. "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'" Maybe you shouldn't film this. No, we're buds, we'll laugh about this later. And then Cujo... don't get me started on Cujo. I don't know, maybe Cujo is as crazy... - You know, on second thought... - as they say after all. Maybe we should just talk to him tomorrow. I wouldn't tell anyone about this, though. You know, for... For Bradley's sake, of course. I mean, he puts a non-saint sinner in my cabin, I have no idea how to deal with him. None. None whatsoever. I don't know how to tell him that he's special, and he's important, and he's worthy. I'll tell you who does... I... I don't... I don't mean that. Sometimes you just got to get it off your chest, you know. My hope is in you, Lord. Use me, Lord. Am I not a tool? Just have to hear you speak. Hello? I can wait. I got all night. Praise the Lord. - Yeah. - Feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat. Woo! Cujo! Cujo! Cujo! Cujo! Cujo! Cujo! Cujo! Music is the highest art form of them all. And it comes right from heaven.

Today is Camp Manna's greatest tradition. You all know what's at stake. Compete your way to the top three cabins and you will punch a ticket to the Leap of Faith. Compete like men today, because the Lord Jesus is watching... and so am I. Keep your head up and move fast, all right? Yeah, man, let's do this. The mud race begins in three, two, one. - Come on! - -Throw off the plan, let's win! Lean on, let's go! Come on! Yeah, let's go! Come on, yeah! Go, come on! And the Righteous Regiment take the first game. So, one game on the books and it's pretty much like last year. Regimen on the top, and the Privates on the bottom. The key to Jesus golf is patience. Did you see that, Ian? In a much aligned way, God love's a real hole in one for our own lives. Four! Who the H did that? Sorry, bro, stray ball. Stray ball? I'll show you a stray ball. - Hole in one. - Turn the other cheek.

Ancient of days and after healing our brother William, h... he will restore his sight. Pick those heads up, there's still time to climb the leaderboard. Todd, that is really good. The Privates are looking pretty pathetic. But they do have an ace in the hole for this next competition. You gotta stretch that stomach out. Jesus fed the 5,000. I need you to eat for the 5,000. Hope you like math class, because it's time for some pie. Assume the position. All right. Home cooking, right, guys? You good? Bradley. Don't you dare. Don't you dare puke, Jerry. All good. I need this. I need this from you. Gordo! No! We still have one more event to get some momentum for tomorrow. Fishers of men. Toss your life preserver to your cabin mate and fish him in 12 times. That's one for each disciple. Three, two, one. Let's go, let's go! - Let's do this, bro. Let's go. - Okay. Help me, Ian! I got it, Ian! Pull it, pull... pull! I got it! Hey, Mom. I'm ready, Dad. Ian! Ian, what's the problem? - I can't swim! - What? You can't? God! You... okay. Ian, calm down, I'm... I'll be your Hasselhoff, okay? Through God, all things are possible, I mean... Ian, where are you going? Hey, Ian. Where have you been? No worries. It doesn't matter. I guess we'll just have to trust God now more than ever. I hate to burst your bubble Bradley, but I've been dead once. There's nothing but darkness. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Do you think the first thing Clayton does when he gets home is tell his mom how awesome he is at God Games? Well, she is his only friend outside of camp. Yeah, but we could learn a thing or two from him. I don't know how to explain this to you, Ian, but the dude is a bad person. Evidenced by the fact that he comes back to this dump year after year to be a counselor. Not... not you, Bradley. You're not like him. Being a counselor is cool. You're right. I'm not like him. I don't have his chiseled face, have his alarming charisma. I give my best for the glory of the Lord and yet everyone's like, "Oh, Clayton!" You're the coolest ever. Hey, I wanna be in your cabin "because you always win... the God Games!" And why do they always win the God Games? I say... it... It's a mental thing. It's like a state of mind. They think they're going to win and therefore, they do. Nope. Just think about it, guys. He strategizes, he get his guys to work harder than anyone else. And let's face it, he's pretty freaking good at it. So, that makes us underdogs. What do we know about underdogs? That they can win, but they... They probably won't... That's wrong. What? It means that we might not have a chance of winning this thing, but we can show everyone the Passover Privates aren't going down without a fight. Gird your loins, gentlemen. It's time to fight fire with fire. Isaiah 40. "He gives strength to the weary..." and increases the power of the week. Even youths grow tired, stumble, and fall, but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles, they will run and not grow weary, "they will walk and not be faint." That ought to do it. V-journal entry, day two. So, yesterday... yesterday was a pretty good day. Found out about this Leap of Faith thing, which seems pretty cool. Gotta, like, launch... Gotta, like, launch the guy. That's why I need to get Ian into the Regiment. I could launch the heck out of him. I need a guy that small on my team. And then I'll get that scholarship, and finally get out of my mom's basement. And maybe get a friend or two outside of camp. 'Cause that's a big goal of mine. Sons of Zion. Shout for joy. Today is the last chance to secure a spot in tomorrow morning Leaps of Faith. Who will climb the leaderboard and take that coveted third and final spot. First step this morning, the Ben Hur Chariot Race. Make one big loop around and be the first to cross the finish line. The race begins in three, two, one. Here we go! Camp Manna! Go! Go, we can pass them. And just like that, the Regiment are out to an early lead. I'm gonna give it some gas, William. Yeah, that's it! - Get that, Regiment! - Come on! - Alright, we're directly ahead of them. - Keep going. Hold on tight, William! They're gaining on us. Keep going, I can see the finish line. - Yeah! - Yes! Woo! There's a storm coming. J-9. Yes, I got them! Yeah! Do a little less, Todd. But good stuff. Next, S-40. Jesus, bingo. Jesus, bingo. Hey! Well, the Privates are looking hard to beat today. And up next, dodge your way to the promised land. If you're struggling to locate this event, simply follow all the campers dressed like Moses. You actually have a shot today brobeans. They say the last shall be first, right? The race across the promised land begins in three, two, one. Later, broses. His name was Moses. Yeah, yeah! Yeah, woohoo! Not bad for Jesus. Oh! Hey, shark bus. Didn't know this thing was handicap accessible? No shield, guess you're done. I got a job for you. Whoa, what... What are you doing? Oh my. Stop it! Stop it, man! Oh my! You're a psycho, man! Woo! Thank you. Don't look now, but the Passover Privates are on the moon. And we still have one more event to determine who moves on to tomorrow's Leap of Faith. Okay. My dearest brother, you need to go down to the lake, get five stones and add them to the pile on the stump, okay? And you're going... you're going to shoot them at the Goliath, but do not... You see Jerry over there? Do not let him get a shot in. You do not want him shooting at it, okay? Just... - Yeah, that definitely translated. - Oh my. - Go, Mo! - You can do it, Mo! Aim... aim low, Mo! I really wish I could speak African. - Go, Mo! - You can do it, Mo! Go, Mo! - Yeah! - Yes! Yes, Mo! Yes! You did it, Mo! I am so glad we adopted you. Yes! - Stupid! - And the results are in. In first place, we have the Religious Right Rank. Taking a surprise and the slip to second is the Righteous Regiment. And taking the final Leap of Faith spot, we have the Passover Privates. Not sure what kind of steroids you pumped last night... but congratulations. Thank you. Alright, impromptu journal entry. There's something I have to do that I need forgiveness for. So, forgive me for what's necessary, but you know I can reach way more lives with that scholarship than any other counselor here. Just saying. Grace and peace. Clayton out. Privates, I am so proud of you. It's... it's like a Christmas miracle, you know, with... without the birth of a savior. But still it's a miracle. Perhaps this sudden change of fortune has something to do with a certain person's leadership skills? Okay. You're right. But, uh, I'd like to take this precious moment, if I might, to nominate Ian as our Leap of Faith participant. We're gonna shoot you into the sky. No, I think Mo should do it, it's more about agility - than size anyways. - Agility? What are you talking about? It's a weight ratio thing. His people know all about physics. I will accept that stereotype, yes. Ian. Now, I would never force you to do anything you didn't want to, okay? But if you don't do this right now, I will be very disappointed in you. In fact, that reminds me of, uh, Devotions. The other night, I was reading about God's disappointment in Jonah when he refused to go to Nineveh. And, oh, my boy, let me tell you, it's a whale of a tale! You don't want to be doing anything that would stop the Lords will... become the laughing stock of all my people. Every year, I get put with the most unathletic bunch of losers. I don't have any idea what I'm doing. You know who does? Clayton. He knows everything. The answers aren't in here. Can you hear me? Hello? There is no God! And don't get me started about Cujo, the whack job. He did do all that shooting and pillaging, he's... Bradley Sommers. Report to my office. I think that he's gonna be the first in line when it comes to the River Styx and getting in the boat and riding to Hades. Praying for you, brother. What was that? Your doubts about faith broadcast for the camp to see? We keep those private. Sir, it's... it's not what it looks like, I... No! What it looks like is you brought a whole lot of shame over this camp. Over yourself and over your personal savior. That's what it looks like. I told you to come to me if you needed advice. What are you gonna do about all this? Go back there and try to be a leader, or tuck tail and run? All right. What's going on here, Ian? If that's even your real name. I don't know. Bradley is not who he says he is, I guess. Say something. Huh? You think I'm stupid? Okay, I knew about the video. Ian, I thought that... I kind of thought we were friends. Friends? We are not friends. I wanted nothing to do with any of you. The only reason I'm in this cabin is because for the past year my luck's been total crap. And I didn't tell you about that video because Clayton told me not to. And I'm glad I didn't. Because I didn't move 2,000 miles to be friends with a bunch of losers like you. Oh, no, no, no. We're not done yet. Yeah. Oh, man, wow! Well, up next we have the Righteous Regiment with Pumping Iron for Jesus. Come on. Hey, brobeans, how long are you going to be on the bench? Oh, hey, I didn't see you there. You know, usually I do core for about 30 to 45 minutes to an hour, but today I'll let you have it, to echo the love of Christ. The love of Christ? What's that? Come, lift, and I'll tell you all about the wild mystery of grace. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son. That whoever believes in him will live forever and ever. Amen. Amen! Amen, and that is wild grace. Yeah... very inspiring. Very inspiring. A great reminder that evangelism can and should happen everywhere. The great commission, brothers. Yeah! Next up, the Passover Privates. Tonight, I bring to you a story, my dearest friends, of desolation and betrayal. You know it well, as it is actually in the hearts of all believers. The setting, the garden of ge... - Gethsemane. - Gethsemane. And I, Gordo, shall play your narrator and personal savior. My friends shall play my faithful apostles, and behold Judas, from Florida, and the chief counsel on their way to arrest the savior of man. And Judas betrayed his friend... with a kiss. - Kiss me. - No. Kiss me. And lo, after the betrayal of our Lord and Savior, the council came forward and pantsed him. And the world kept turning. The end. Hey, Gordumb, these stories are supposed to be about redemption. Not all stories end with an altar call. Okay. Up next, the Biblical Brigade. What's going on, son? Nothing. Sit, son. Hey... sit down. You were scared there. I know because I can see fear, a lot of people can't. But I can. Amazing grace, isn't it? What's that? The other side. The spiritual realm, where the angels live, the angels play, the angels fly. I know you've been there, because you have rainbows on your shoulders that I can see. Let me ask you this. What was it like for you? Terrifying. My parents' church... told them I needed baptism. And in the river, when I was being held under, we were attacked by alligators. Why are you laughing? Christians killed my parents and almost killed me. Okay, I'm not laughing. I just reacted in a... Not a good way. Let me tell you something, Ian. Your first death is a blessing, because it creates a need for you to live in faith. Those letters stand for, "Fantastic Adventures In Trusting Him." And that's why we're here. So, what do you need to break free of to see clearly? - My fear. - Your fear. F-E-A-R. That stands for, "False Evidence Appearing Real." There's no reason to be afraid. People who are in fear create it themselves. And where does it get them? Nowhere. Lose fear, buddy, dismiss fear. It doesn't work. It's something you're creating over nothing. Dismiss fear. I'm sorry to inform you that Bradley is going to leave in the morning. Without a leader, I'm going to have to split the Privates up into different cabins. Ian, what did I tell you? I told you I'd get it done, right? What's up, brother? Welcome, my friend, to the Righteous Regiment. Let's go. Cut the chit chat, jumps. I got an announcement to make. I'd like to welcome the ticket to tomorrow's God Games victory... Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian... Tomorrow morning, I will launch this small, frail, stick like, human shaped projectile into the atmosphere, securing our fifth consecutive God Games victory. Let me hear it. Let me hear it. Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian! Don't get me wrong, I love me some horseplay. Shenanigans are great, you all know I'm big on tomfoolery. I need you guys to get some rest. Got a big day tomorrow. Woo! Let's do this! Yeah, come on! Woo! Dear campers, we will only have two cabins in this year's Leap of Faith. The Religious Right Rank or the Righteous Regiment, who will display themselves as the superior Christians in this year's winner-take-all finale? What's up brother? Hey, the first one up? What if I don't want to join up? What do you mean? You're already in. God's will is done. No, I mean, what if I don't want to be a part of the Leap of Faith? Oh! Oh, well, then, uh, I'll just have to personally ensure that Todd kicks you in the face every day for the rest of your life. I'm just kidding, man. You'll do great. God be the glory, buddy. Woohoo! - My name is Billy. - Do you like America? Have you ever seen the Superman? America as great as you thought it was? - Do you like... - Where in Africa are you from? - What the crap are you doing? - I need some time -to find Bradley. - How are you planning on doing that, using your Everglade voodoo? You don't even know where he went. I know, I need a miracle. Stall as long as you can. Can you actually run as fast as we think you can? You believe in Jesus, though, right? - Do you want my food? - Do you like the water? Dude, what happened in there? Any idea? Where is he? Who do you mean, bro? The projectile, Todd. This is Ian Fletcher. I'm looking for a tall, lanky camp counselor. His name is Bradley. Over. Is anyone listening? Over. I'm looking for Bradley Sommers. He's a camp counselor at Camp Manna. Over. - Why did you pull the lever? - It was a diversion. - Yeah? - For what? Ian is gonna... Dang it! No! Who pulled the alarm? You guys, come on! There are rules here, guys. Cujo said, "Go to the Leap of Faith with no breakfast", at the Lake of Galilee." Da... garn it! - This is a disaster. - That went well. I don't know, fellas. I made a real spectacle of myself. A real spectacle. It was bad, I mean, you can't imagine. So, I guess it's just time to start thinking about a... a new career. Carpenter, tax collector, fisherman. Future is looking bright for Bradley, though. We're just going to keep moving. Yeah. Hey! Shit. Good. Hey, this... Can I have it... great band! Oh, yeah. Thank you. Welcome to the Leap of Faith. Come on, energy, energy! Okay. Our finalists, the Religious Right Rank. And the Righteous Regiment. Okay. Religious Right Rank, you're up! I'm not a leader. I'm a... I'm a horrible leader. Horrible leader. This is Ian Fletcher. I'm looking for Bradley Sommers. - He's a camp counselor at Camp Manna, over. - Finally. Yeah, Ian, we have him. Bradley. Hello? Hey, Ian. Hi, Bradley. Why did you leave? I'm not coming back. Over. What did you do that for? To knock a little sense into that noggin of yours. - Bradley. - Really? Hello? You've been fasting all week for this. I don't feel good. - Don't let me down. - I need food. Pick up the timing. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! It's something you've been wanting to do, something I've been waiting to see. Bomber ready? All right, let's see it. Come on! Thank you. I appreciate that. Righteous Regiment. You're up! We're not going back. The damage has been done. Now, wait, you just... Talk to the boy. Come on. I'm no different, Ian. I've been just like Clayton. I was using you too, thinking about myself. I wasn't thinking about anybody else. So, buddy, it's over. Over. Clayton would never tell me the truth like you did. You're finally being honest with yourself, like you were that night at the fire. What are you so scared of, Bradley? What's the worst that could happen? People will always say, "Bradley was the guy who ran away. He was the one who never finished what he started." Let's finish this together. There's no one else I'd rather have as my leader. Please! Over. Hear that? He wants you back. All right. Let's finished this thing with style, boys. Not so fast. Brother. Cujo, my man. What's the meaning of this debauchery, huh? - Stand down, Gordo. - Sir. Every year he comes in here and rigs the system. - Whoa! - We earned our right to compete today, sir, fair and square. Can we get some order here? It seems like the superiority of the Righteous Reg has led to some jealousy among the less gifted campers. Truth is eternal. - Sir... - As it was in the beginning and as it is now. You need to find a leader to compete. Thank you. Let's go, Todd. Yes! What now? Never thought I'd say this, William, but... we're gonna have to pray. Go. Go. Man, Todd's shorts are really tight. Oh, Jesus... If victory shall become this humble servant, it is a victory for all. Because I believe the Righteous Regiment has been chosen to showcase that with great faith come great victory. Today, God's will be done on Earth as it is... Good gravy on Moses! Are you done? As it is in heaven. Good work, guys, good work. Two, three, four! Hit it! See, Gordo, the Regimen always wins. I was born to win these games. Clayton! Let my Privates go! Bradley? - Sir. - Wait, what are you doing back here? I don't know. But I'm tired of running. Pretending to be somebody I'm not. And I'm Bradley, perpetual screw up. I'm here to say I'm sorry. All right. That works. Yeah, fancy speech, Brad. But Cujo is not going to let you just roll back in here like you own the place, and just give you another chance. Oh, I'm not asking for another chance. I'm asking for forgiveness. But competing would be nice. Bradley had the courage to come back here, and aren't you guys all about second chances? Yeah, but not for sinners. We already won, okay. God's will is done, forever and ever. Amen. Hold on. Put a lid on it. "Amen" is rarely the end. It just sets us up for a new level to go to. Do you still have the pass? Bradley, choose a camper. What? Now, who's coming with me? I think my brother should do it. Yeah, I... I agree. It's more of an agility thing than anything else. I mean, if you think about the blob - and how much air is in there... - No, yeah. It's more about trying to get on it, and, like, that's gonna be the difficulty. I'll do it. Clayton, do something. What's he doing? Go get them. - All right. - Clayton, you have to stop this. Please. Let me think, let me think. That kid is gonna fly. This Leap of Faith will change your life. And your spirit, and your heart. Cujo, is this some kind of joke? Okay, you can't allow this tomfoolery here. - That storm is past. - We already displayed God's greatness, and you're freaking ruining it, and you're freaking ruining Camp Manna for everyone, -and you're ruining my whole summer! - Calm down, Clayton. It's all right. Clayton! Jesus! Yes, yes! Woo! No! Stop it, stop it! He can't swim. Ian, you know, I really can't save your life all the time in the water, I am not Aquaman. When I was 15 years old, I was forced to go to summer camp. It was called Camp Manna. And although I thought it would be terrible, as it turns out, that week with my friends, forever changed my life. - ♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪ - ♪ I have a friend in Jesus ♪ - ♪ Jesus is a friend of... ♪ - ♪ Jesus... ♪ Wow, wow, wow, wait!

Why are you just sitting there? Do something! Get my sword. About how you live at home with your mom? It's not funny. Not funny. My mom has MS, I stay at home so she can live with dignity. Oh, I thought it was 'cause your roommates kicked you out 'cause of your cologne addiction. You know about my cologne addiction? Smell it on you right now. When you take shortcuts, you get chuck... fi... figgy. Take 6, mark. Excuse me. 140 Romeo. Take one, A-mark. - Romeo. - A-Mark! Guess I'll never know. Look, Ian, in this place sucks because you're stuck with Bradley, okay. The dudes are total goober. Seriously, he just... just sautés in goob sauce all day. All right? Now, don't jump to conclusions, pal. You never know who you're gonna meet a camp. In fact, I meet your aunt Sharon at camp. I was in eighth year counselor, and she was the prettiest camper I'd ever laid eyes on. - Oh! - Oh... oh, are those my teeth? Oh boy, I've really got to take off this adult diaper. You know what? - What? - This doesn't concern you, Clayton. Oh, it concerns me, Bradley, it concerns me big time. Look how concerned my face is. You see the concern? - You see that? - Looks like constipation to me. You say constipation, I can... I say consternation. - All right. Let's keep going, let's keep going. - Okay. Come on. He's... They're disqualified. - We won. We won! - Disqualification! - Yeah! - We won! It's the end of the movie, guys! Roll the credits. Roll the credits. Go, quick, please.
