(BIRDS TWEET) (WHIRRING) It's like a pink frosting whirlpool! Can't that thing go any faster? (YAPS) (LAUGHS) Any faster and Honey might try to chase it! (BOTH LAUGH) (PINGS) Finally, we can decorate. -(SIZZLING) -Not yet, Zoie. The recipe says the cupcakes have to cool for 25 minutes first. (GROANS) What are we gonna do for 25 minutes? That's forever! Well, we could plan how we're going to decorate them. OTTO: Too late. I couldn't wait either. Barbie, you do know that frosting slides off a hot cupcake, right? My rocket ship! It's melted. Whoops. Guess we should have waited. -Waiting's boring. -Not if Chelsea tells a story. Yay! Please, Chelsea? Okay, and maybe I'll even put you in the story, Otto. Probably make it more interesting. -(ALL LAUGH) -One day, Barbie and I were flying high over Dreamtopia. Ooh, I love it when you two have wings! CHELSEA: We were looking down on the fields of Sweetville, when suddenly it started to rain big candy sprinkles. ZOIE: Sprinkles! What did you do? CHELSEA: We opened our mouths! Then we saw something amazing. Whoo-hoo! It's a candy cornfield. (BARBIE LAUGHS) (PANTS) Barbie? Honey! Where'd they go? (LAUGHS) (WHINNYING) Well, hello, Chelsea, Sugar Spun Barbie, Honey! Hi, Sheriff Seed. Hi, Neo. Hi, Sundae. Oh, so you know the unicorns? Unicones! Because we love ice cream. (WHISPERS) Actually, it's because their horns are really ice-cream cones. Can you two help us solve a mystery? -Of course. -We'd love to. Hop on. We'll give you the scoop. Make that a double scoop. (WHINNIES) NEO: This is our home. Or it was, until someone started nibbling it. BOTH: Teeth marks! -(THUD) -(BOTH GASP) I thought I was the sheriff today. -I thought you were selling snow cones. -Ooh. My snow-cone cart. Anyone like one? What do you think happened here, Sheriff Seed? Hmm. Someone's been biting this barn. And I think I know who. -A Strawberry Bear! -Exactly. -Oh! -Oh, I was right! You know you're not supposed to nibble anyone's home. We're sorry. We didn't think anyone lived in this barn. -What? -That's our home. That licorice does look a little dried up. It could snap and break. (CHOMP) Mmm! (RATTLING) -(ALL GASP) -Oh, no! (STRAWBERRY BEAR CLEARS THROAT) -(KNOCKING) -Hmm? (GULPS) Ah. We have to fix this. What can we do to help? (GASPS) I'm not sure there's anything anyone can do. -We could build a new barn! -Yeah! (FANFARE) (YAPS) It is I, the Notto Prince, here to haul off this fallen-down barn. You horses don't mind, right? BOTH: We're unicones! I don't get it. We have horns and we love ice cream. I'm even named after a flavor. Neapolitan the Third. (CHUCKLES) Neo for short. Hang on, Notto. Why do you want this stuff? You'll find out, Chelsea. One day. Haul it off. We'll start fresh. Super strawberry fresh. We're going to build a unicorn palace. -Uh... A palace? -Oh, I bet it's a fancy word for barn. -I can't wait. Let's get started. -ALL: Yeah! -Do you have a plan? -No time! -(WHIRRING) -(GASPS) Wow, the Strawberry Bears got everyone to help so fast. I hope not too fast. Dark chocolate with sea salt and almonds coming through. Stained-glass sour candy window coming down. -What do you think? -Uh... I haven't had time to think. It's all happening so fast. And I don't see any red licorice. We're not using any. Out with the old, in with the new. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Yeah, well, um, speaking of our new barn, did anyone draw a picture of what it's gonna kinda look like? No time! We've got a barn to build. Um, maybe that's why you need a plan. Nah, we're just making it up as we go. Oh, I just thought of something. Turrets of taffy! It's a barn castle! (GASPS) Maybe we could build a moat or a drawbridge. Uh... It's kind of hard to watch our house being rebuilt. We're gonna go do... unicone stuff. (CLEARS THROAT) Brush our manes, practice our prancing. -(CHUCKLES) -Yeah. Great idea. We'll come get you when it's finished. I can picture a sugar-cube tower. Can't you? Just a few more steps. You're gonna love it. CHELSEA: Okay, open your eyes. It's uh... Uh, it's... -So... uh... um... -Yeah. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Step inside your brand-new palace. With solid-chocolate walls. WATERMELON MAN: And caramel floors! -They're a little... (LAUGHS) -(SQUELCHING) Uh, sticky. Don't you like it? (INHALES) Actually, all we wanted was really... (SPLAT) Wait! Did frosting just fall on my cone? I mean, horn? (SPLAT) -(ALL GASP) -The walls are melting! -(ALL YELL) -(CLATTERING) (BUBBLING) Maybe we should have thought that through. Chocolate melts in the sun. That's just science. We probably should have taken our time. Made some plans first. Uh... What I was saying before the barn melted was that's not the only thing. I mean, we didn't really want a new barn. Because you wanted your old barn back, right? BOTH: Yes. -But it's too late now. -(WHOOSHING) Not when I'm around. Welcome to Gooey Junkyard. Look around you. It's everything Sweetville throws away. Crushed candy. Fruit peels. Stuff chewed up by the Strawberry Bears. This is amazing! But why did you collect all this stuff? I knew someone would want it one day. It's yours... for a small fee. -What? -You want us to pay? Of course not. I just want, um... my name on a building. Is it okay with you two if your new home is called the Notto Barn? Well, sure. Wait, does that mean it's not a barn? I... I'm confused. Uh, yeah, me too. Never mind. Take anything you want. We'll use the original pieces of the barn's red licorice here. And some broken lollipops here. You know, I wouldn't mind one of those turrets. Turret, check. We'll use an ice-cream cone. They're quite useful. Uh-huh, and, you know, those ladders were kind of nice. -(WHINNIES) -Ladder, check. I think I saw some broken pretzels in the Gooey Junkyard. (HAMMERING) (SIGHS) UNICONES: Oh! Our barn! (ALL LAUGH) -It really helps to have a plan. -(SPRINKLING SOUND) CHELSEA: And so the unicones got their new home. Along with a little bit of their old home. And it even held up in the candy sprinkles rain. The end. Great story, Chelsea. I'm going to cover my cupcake with sprinkles. Do we have any broken pretzels, like the Notto Prince had? I call dibs on the pink frosting. What are you going to put on your cupcake, Otto? Have some patience, Chelsea. You should know by now that you can't rush genius. (ALL LAUGH) Maybe I should use a little bit of pink after all. -Maybe some sprinkles. -Yeah, I think that's a great idea. -Thanks. -Yeah, of course.

A story about teamwork. -It's all good. -Nice try, nice try. I had to go for it. I know Mom and Dad said lights out by 9:00, but... they didn't say anything about flashlights. -Awesome! -This is the best sleepover ever. -Not that I've ever been to one before. -(LIGHT CLICKS) -(TORCH CLICKS) -(BOTH LAUGH) I feel so grown up. Even though I did bring my favorite sleep buddy. This is my bear. I know someone who would love to meet him, Zoie. -Sparkles, say hello to Zoie's bear. -(BOTH LAUGH) Couldn't do night time without this. What about you, Otto? Me? No. I don't need any sleep buddy thingy. Well, then, Otto, you already know that the best part of a sleepover is story time. One day in a place called Dreamtopia, something very big was going on. What's going on in Sweetville today, Barbie? Notto Prince has a big surprise for the whole town. No one knows what. Everybody in their places? The Fruity Mermaids are ready to rock, Notto Prince. Ladies and gentlemints, I, Sir Fancy Cheese, am pleased to announce the grand opening of our very own lemonade-spouting fountain. (CHUCKLES) Created by Notto Prince as a gift to Sweetville. (CHEERING) Fruity Mermaids, take it away! ALL: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! SIR FANCY CHEESE: Blast off! (CHEERING) (WHOOPING) (STRETCHING) -Oh, no! Is that supposed to happen? -I think it's going to burst. (STRETCHING) (HISSING) (ALL GASP) Why didn't I test it first? My reputation is ruined! Oh, dear! (CHUCKLES) This is quite the carbonated catastrophe. Don't worry, I'm sure he'll go back to the drawing board and try again. (GROANS) It's not that. We have reporters from the Candy News Network here in three hours to cover the story. We have to make this work somehow. You came to the right team. We've got your back on this one, Sir Fancy. -I feel so bad for Notto. -I know! He worked really hard on this for everyone. We're his friends. He shouldn't feel embarrassed. And you know the great motto. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Things don't always work the first time. I think somebody needs to hear that. Be right back. Notto? Can I talk to you? Wish I could help. I'm in the middle of prince stuff. So, sorry. Can't talk. Didn't you hear me? I'm super busy. I wanted to see how you were doing and to tell you something. What? That the fountain was a bust? You probably just came over to make fun of me. Of course not. The fountain is an amazing idea. And what I wanted to say was... you gave it a great try. You can fix the problems and next time it will work. (PANTS) (GRUNTS) That's nothing. Just some old rag. Anyway, like I said, I have prince things to take care of. So thanks for coming, but goodbye. There has to be a solution. Maybe there's a way to slow down the lemonade. If the candy had smaller holes... Or if the tubes were wider... (YAPS) -How did it go? -He didn't want to talk. I guess he's kind of embarrassed. Give him time. He'll come around. (YAPS) (BUBBLING) Barbie, I just got an idea. What if we build a bubble generator instead of a fountain? I think that's an amazing brainstorm. There's something about Sweetville that always makes me feel creative. Here's how it would work. We get lemonade from the river here, you mermaids all splash, then it goes through here, then the bubbles are added and then sparkling lemonade for Sweetville. Well, we do love to splash! I think this new plan is worth a try. Yeah, we have the chance to make it better. Ooh, and we can be the ones surprising Notto instead of the other way around. Great! Chelsea and I will be in charge of finding the parts and we can ask the whole town to help. Now everyone can participate in building Notto's new Sweetville Supersonic Sparkling Lemonator! Ooh, that's a tongue twister. There you go. Hope it helps. Thank you, Sir Fancy Cheese. These babies will come in handy. Gummy uni shoes! Hmm, those could work for sealing the bubble maker. Then they're all yours. Hooves, get ready to run in the lime grass. Don't eat the machine, don't eat the machine. Looks like the generator is coming together. Thanks to all our teamwork. Chelsea! What's everybody working on? It was supposed to be a surprise. For you, actually. For me? What kind of surprise? (HAMMERING) This better not be another try at the fountain, 'cause it's just going to fail! Don't you think I'm embarrassed enough? You don't have to be embarrassed to fail in front of your friends, Notto. They'll always support you. Look around. Well, we'd better see if this machine is ready to work. -Intake mechanism. -Check. Bubble maximizer. -In place and ready to bubble. -(BUBBLING) Oh! It looks like we'll need something to slow the flow of the lemonade so it doesn't blast out like last time. Maybe if we had a blanket... -But everyone has donated already. -(GULPS) Not everyone. -(FOOTSTEPS) -(PANTING) Don't tell me, the generator already broke, right? I knew it wouldn't work. Actually, I think it will. We just need one more piece. A small flap to slow down the flow of the lemonade. Like the blanket piece Honey found before. Oh, that? That's just a rag. I don't see how that's going to save the generator. Notto, I know what it is. It's cool. It reminds me of a stuffed dog I know named Barkles. It's just an old piece of blanket I've had since I was a baby. It's nothing like Barkles. Okay, but I bet if you come to town with me and donate it to the generator, you'll be called a hero. Hmm. Notto Hero does sound nice. And if you start to really miss it, you can visit it any time. You'll always know where it is. What are we standing here for? We've got a generator to build. (YAPS) -(CREAKING) -(GRUNTS) My blanket is in place. Done. Ready to bubble. -I hope. -Thank you, Notto Prince. Start up the Sweetville Supersonic Sparkling Lemonator. (SPLASH) Ten, nine... Oh, let's just get on with it. (BUBBLING) (SPLASHING) (LOUD GUSHING) -(CHEERING) -We did it, Chelsea. (WHOOPING) (LAUGHTER) Yeah! Whoo-hoo! CHELSEA: We all helped Sweetville to always have sparkling lemonade for everyone. I liked the part where Notto Prince saved the day. And his friends stood by him. It reminds me of this old blanket I just happen to have with me. Wow! It looks just like what Notto Prince used for the generator. That's awesome. Actually, mine's a whole lot better. It's got all the planets on it. Well, it used to when it was bigger and I was smaller. You know, it's probably the best sleep buddy ever.

(BARKING) CHELSEA: I see it, Honey! (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS) -Good catch, Chels. -It's a good addition to my collection. What collection? Oh, hey, Otto. My feather collection. See? And I collect seashells. I found all these at the beach this summer. Huh. Maybe I should do this collection thing. You could start with this quartz rock. Nah, I'm thinking something giant and mega amazing! -I love Dreamtopia. Don't you, Honey? -(BARKS) Especially Sparkle Mountain, where we float in bubbles. Wait, what if they pop? (GASPS) (BOING) (CHUCKLES) Bubble steps! Barbie! Hi, Chelsea. You'll never guess what I'm doing. -Planning a party? -(LAUGHS) You know me so well. -Yes, it's a giant, mega amazing event. -GIRL: We're here. One second, Chels. -Princess Amethyst. -Yes? Make sure everyone gets here before sunset. Oh, and Princess Cobalt? Can you get the standing chart, please? -Sure. -(CHUCKLES) It's like a seating chart but for standing. Princes coming through. Hi, Chelsea. Princess Queen Barbie. Can't wait for sunset. Your first gem ceremony. Oh, exciting! -I'm so happy you're here. -Me too! Um... What's a gem ceremony? Oh! I had that down to explain. We all put special gems on our outfits to reflect a beam of light from the setting sun. Then the rays extend across the kingdom. It's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen. -Wow, that sounds amazing! -It is. Oh, Princess Cobalt. Hang on, let me help you with that. Be right back, Chels. (GASPS) Oh! -Whoops. -Pardon. (SIGHS) Is everything okay, Sapphire? Yes! I mean no. I mean... I'm way behind in making gems for the ceremony tonight. So many gems to make, so little time. -I'm not sure I can do it all alone. -(GROWLS) Well, Barbie and I can help you. Really? Oh, my goodness, you're a gem! I'll go start up the gem-making machine. Meet you in the Glitter Caves in a few minutes. -This is gonna be great. -What's going to be great? I hope you don't mind. I kind of volunteered us to be Sapphire's helpers. She's pretty busy. That is great! The gem ceremony is all about showing inner beauty. And your kind act did just that. Off to the Glitter Caves. Hey! Hey! Sapphire! Hold up! -Yes? -(PANTING) Wow, you... sure can... move fast. It's not that hard. I have wings, you know. How can I help you? I can help you. (PANTS) I have the fastest gem-making machine ever. That's kind of you. But I have two helpers now. Chelsea and Barbie. But my machine works at sparkle speed. Sparkle speed? Ooh! Maybe I could take a quick look. (CAT PURRS) This only makes one gem at a time. But it works at sparkle speed, remember? And you can make as many gems as you want. Right after you make one giant mega-amazing gem for me. I would do it myself but you're the expert, after all. So you're saying this machine doesn't work? Yet. But I know you can make it work. You're the gem fairy. Well, if it's as fast as you say, I guess I can help you. CHELSEA: Hi, Glitter Balls. -(GLITTER BALLS CHATTER) -Sapphire! Where are you? -(PANTS) -CHELSEA: I wonder where she is. (HONEY SQUEALS) There's not a lot of time until the gem ceremony. Let's get started. Do you know how to work the Gemonstrator? (ALL CHATTER) BARBIE: Glitter Balls love to be helpful. -A flag? We find a flag? -(ALL CHATTER) -You always were good at charades. -(CHUCKLES) Thanks. But why do we need a flag? (CHATTERS) -CHELSEA: Pyramid? -(CHATTERS) Cheerleader? Roll? Flip? Flip! Flip a switch! (ALL CHEER) But which switch? -(BARKING) -Up there! By a flag! Good girl! -Phew! Well done. -(RATTLING) Honey, you did it! You turned on the Gemonstrator. (BARKS) -This one, this one and that and that. -(WHIRRING) (SQUEALS) (WHIRRING) (GASPS) (LOUD BUZZING) We must have punched the wrong button. But which one? (HISSING) (GASPS) What do I do now? Use your magic to make it stop! Whoops. Apprentice queen. Still learning magic. Back to pushing levers. (WHOOSHING) (HISSING STOPS) Awesome, Chels. That's one way to use wings. And look what you did. You hit the right switch to make gems. Yeah! (HUMS CHEERFULLY) -Ooh-ooh! -(LAUGHS) (YAPS) Huh? Those aren't gems. They're rocks. You could try your magic again and change the rocks into gems. As we've seen, it doesn't always work the way I want. It's worth a try. I believe in you. Hey, my wings are gone! Yeah, this is just not my day for magic. If we don't figure something out, the gem ceremony will be canceled. I have an idea. Okay, let's see if it works. Whoa! It's amazing! There's a million of me. Isn't there something you'd like to say? Oh, yeah. I love you, giant amazing gem. (SAPPHIRE CLEARS THROAT) Oh, you meant... Oh, right. Thanks, Sapphire. You can use the machine for yourself now. (SIGHS) The sun is setting. We're out of time. We can't have a gem ceremony with no gems. I hope Barbie and Chelsea made some. Since the Gemonstrator is a magical machine, it might work backwards to make gems. And pushing this handle will make it go in reverse. Good idea! (BOTH GRUNT) -Yay! -All right! -(CLATTER) -What was that? (SNIFFS) (THUDDING) (GASPS) They're coming too fast! (SIGHS) Hey, my magic worked that time. (GASPS) (THUDDING) -(MACHINE POWERS DOWN) -(SIGHS) We're so sorry. You were gone. We tried to help. But we could only make rocks... You did an absolutely fantastic job! BOTH: We did? See? You made them perfectly. You mean those rocks all have gems inside? -We didn't know. -(LAUGHS) I think we forgot one of the most important things in Sparkle Mountain. Things aren't always what they seem. Okay, everyone. Remember your places from the standing chart. Barbie, look! It's almost time. Out of my way. I have the biggest gem so I need to reflect the beam of light for the gem ceremony. It's a big responsibility, Notto. Are you sure you're up for it? Sure! (YELLS) (NOTTO MOANS) (MOANS) What good is a beautiful giant gem if I don't get to use it? That's okay. You do know that true beauty is on the inside. Right? -Beautiful! -Amazing! (WHOOSHING) Look how the light shines through the crystal. It's okay, I guess. It's more than okay. It's magic.

Usually, Honey just buries them in the back yard. Sorry about that. Chels, have you seen my car keys? I can't find them anywhere. Hi, Otto. They're gone. Vanished into thin air. I'll help you look for them. I might as well help too, since I'm here. (GROANS) We're never going to find those keys! We might as well give up. We're not gonna give up.

(LAUGHS) -(GLITTER BALLS CHATTER) -Cool! (YAPS) BARBIE: Well, that didn't work. -Barbie! -Hi, Chelsea. -Did you make my crown reappear? -Uh, not yet. Why is that on Elephant King's head? He lost his crown and I'm using my magic to make it reappear. Or I'm trying to, anyway. Is it back? No. But that's a very nice... um... potted palm tree. -You know, up there on your head. -Oh... Don't worry, we'll get it back. Now let me just try to remember the right spell. So how did you lose your crown? I'm not sure. Well, when did you have it on your head last? That's a good question. It was... It was... I don't remember. I thought elephants never forget. Where did you hear that one? -Oh! My crown! I-Is it my crown? -(SQUEALS) -(YELLS) Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! -(KITTEN SQUEALS) -What's happening? -Whoa! (YAPS) Stop! Elephant King! It's okay. It's only Precious the kitten. -(YELLS) -Oh! (MEOWS) Sorry, Precious. I didn't know it was you... digging your kitty claws into my head. Huh! Oh. I'm sure I'll get it this time. Wait. Where's my wand? It's gone. Vanished into thin air. We'll help you look for it. Right, Elephant King? Right! (LAUGHS) Uh... You know, I don't exactly have great luck in locating lost things. Where did you last have your wand? In my hand. I guess I dropped it in all the excitement. Maybe Honey can find it. Honey? Honey's gone! Have you seen her? Not since a certain kitten clawed my head. (SHUDDERS) Oh, boy, oh, boy. We're losing so many things today. Yeah. Don't worry, Chelsea. She couldn't have gone far. Let's go back towards the castle. But what about your wand? It can wait. Honey is much more important than my wand. It is I, the Notto Prince. What's going on? Honey's lost. Have you seen her anywhere? I haven't seen her since... Since the last time I saw her. Can you help us look? Sorry, I'm really busy right now with very important prince work. I just came over to ask the Elephant King to help me out. You got a minute, EK? Not really. We need to find Honey. And then we need to find Barbie's magic wand. And then we need to find my crown. Oh, boy, what a day. What did you say? My crown. It's missing. It started off as an ordinary day with my crown on my head. No, before that. Barbie's wand is missing? I'll help you look. Wait, I thought you had important prince work to do. Never mind that! What are we standing around here for? We have a wand... I mean... (CHUCKLES)... a dog to find. (GLITTER BALLS CHATTER) (YAWNS) -Honey! Here, girl! -Come here, Honey! -Where are you? Honey! -Honey! Here, Honey, Honey, Honey, Honey, Honey! (GASPS) Oh, this could be a wand. That's just a stick. Maybe Honey went looking for a stick to chew on. So we should look for a stick now? Or a place where you find sticks. Or a place to bury them. And if we find either of those, we might find Honey. (MOANS) We're never gonna find her. Don't worry, we will. We can't give up. If we keep looking, we can find her. (GROANS) Fine. I'll help you look. For real. We gotta keep on looking keep looking don't stop Keep looking and looking till we find it You gotta keep on looking keep looking don't stop Keep looking till you find it We gotta keep on looking keep looking don't stop Keep looking and looking till we find it You gotta keep on looking keep looking don't stop -Keep looking till you find it -(BOTH LAUGH) Keep on looking keep looking don't stop Keep looking and looking till we find it We gotta keep on looking keep looking don't stop Keep looking till we find it We gotta keep on looking keep looking don't stop Keep looking and looking till we find it We gotta keep on looking keep looking don't stop Keep looking till we find it (MEOWS) (GROANS) We're never going to find Honey!

They must know something about Honey. Let's go. If only I had my wand, I'd get us there with magic. (GROANS) I may be a king without a crown, but I'm still an elephant. ELEPHANT KING: Follow the balls. Keep looking Till you find it Keep looking Don't stop Keep on looking keep looking don't stop Keep looking and looking till we find it We gotta keep on looking keep looking don't stop Keep looking till we find it -(ALL LAUGH) -There she is! -(WHOOPING) -(YAPS) (LAUGHS) (TRUMPETS) -The magic wand! -(YAPS) Honey, bring that back! Oh, she must have thought it was a stick when it flew out of my hand. Oh! She's going to bury it. Oh, no, she's not! -Hey! -ELEPHANT KING: Let go of that wand. Good catch. (YAPS) But, EK, I was just trying to keep it from Honey. Oh, I thought you wanted that wand for yourself. Sorry, Notto. Losing this stuff has got me all mixed up. You gotta stay calm, EK. Like me. Anyway, I've got important prince stuff to do. I can't hang around here all day. See you later. Chelsea, I'm glad we found Honey. And, Barbie, I'm glad we found your wand. But what about my crown? (GLITTER BALLS CHATTER) (CHATTERS) Oh! Could it be? Is it? -BOTH: Your crown! -Oh! (BOTH LAUGH) Now I remember. I took it off behind that tree to scratch my head. The Glitter Ball creatures must have found it. Thank you, Glitter Balls. (ALL CHEER) I guess we all lose stuff once in a while. Right, Honey? Honey? (PANTS) (ALL LAUGH) BARBIE: Hey!
