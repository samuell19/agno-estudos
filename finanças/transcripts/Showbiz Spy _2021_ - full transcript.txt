Let her finish please In fact, when Circle became an intern, the whole family was delighted and supported this. But she has so many loans. Her mother has to mortgage her flat So you came back from the USA to help her? This young cousin listened to me since she was a kid. I came back to persuade her to break the contract. But I read it carefully, if one party breaks the contract... A few more flats won't be enough... So I bought some camera and stuff for her, let her infiltrate the company and see if she could film some evidence. Like how the company threathens her... But the USB was left in the control room Hey, you did find evidence, right? Good. We go back together for the USB. Then we can sue New Star! Let's go... What the hell are you doing? Are you thinking of continuing to compete in the competition? No... Today Circle told me she wants us to complete the competition then we leave together... Are you still crazily mad about becoming a star? I want to bring Circle home. But I respect her. And we haven't got the USB yet All in all, once I got evidence, I'll go! You're a senior.

The producer said this styling is ok Ok? Which part of it is ok? Have we offended you? Be honest! No... Could we change our costumes? All costumes and accessories were chosen by Lisa. Not me Wow! How could we dance on the stage with these on? Ha ha... Both of us are poetic. Why this murderous look? Right, I should be the cute one. This costume does not suit me Not really. It suits you well. Exactly shows your character No. 5, this costume suits you! Wow! Are you being nice to me? Look at them. Why are their costumes so beautiful? They paid for the styling that I designed Conning again!

Wake up! I know you did not come for the competition, but I did! I only want to do what I love to do on stage. I don't care if I go broke or be conned If you sabotage my chance to win... I'll reveal who you really are We're fine with this styling. Please excuse us Hi, Kira, you'll surely become the champion if the trend continues as it is You never know. No one can surely win. I'm only striving to do my best in the competition Cut! So fake. Good. Audience likes this. You may go now. Team B, be quick. You are dragging others. We are doing the making of...

Okay, quick Just say something. We'll delete the NG parts. Good parts got a chance to be aired. Ready? Hello everyone! I'm Circle O, a competitor in New Star Production. I'm so glad to be in Team B this season and perform together with my team... People tried to discourage me from doing this... They said don't waste my time. I know well I might not be suitable for this business. I'm not pretty enough, not talented enough, not rich enough... A philosopher said... Life... There is no meaning in life. Whatever you do, you die at the end. Meaning is how others define you, or how you define yourself. If you don't believe, if you don't do it by heart, everything will be meaningless. Dunno if you know what I'm saying. I'm not sure if I understand it myself... I finally think of what to say I haven't been serious about this competition. Because I haven't Because I haven't attached importance to this But, I just got to realize something. We can choose not to participate. Once participated, you need to do it whole-heartedly. Otherwise you are not respecting the others. You'll make it meaningless for people who are seriously doing this. That's why I agree totally with Circle. Do it by heart, and it becomes meaningful They say light will linger on, anchor among the stars Crystalised affections float again, forever accompanying a certain star Music plays, rhyming with the wind, billowing hope and desire Pick the only wish, and select talents with New Star The Final for the 5th season "New Star Production" commences now. At times we lack new stars, you don't have a reason to miss this chance to select new stars, do you? Right, Miss Strict! Don't just sit and watch, remember to vote on line! I don't wanna be cool Girls And I won't be afraid Boys Bring yourself and live tonight! OK Let's go! We got to warm up and sream now. Right? For this second, we practised billions of seconds. Right? We pretend to be normal and practical everyday. We are just being weak and afraid. You don't need a gold card or black card. You just need confidance. Work Hard Play Hard Are you going to realize your dream? Depends on how much you sweated and how hard you tried Harsh words and traps are not surprising I'm so nervous This is good, very good Sing loudly and rejoice on stage Don't be Shy Don't be Shy Ya E Ya E Ya Don't be Shy I don't wanna be cool I don't wanna be rude I don't wanna be And you don't wanna be Don't be Shy Call for everybody to sail on together. Hey! The costume is good after alteration Right, you saved us I just try my best Thanks There is only one chance. We don't think of anything else. Just do it! Ok? Ok! I know you wanted to leave very soon. Thank you for giving me another chance. I must complete the competition No need say anything. Just do it! Yeh Should we go back for the USB It can wait a bit. Don't have to go back right now No, it can't wait. It's important. Most of the guards are down here now. It would be easy if we go now Er... Where is the USB now?
