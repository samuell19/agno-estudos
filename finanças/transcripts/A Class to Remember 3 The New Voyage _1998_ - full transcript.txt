Now, don't you say a word. No matter what the employees say, don't apologize, or make excuses. This is harder for you than it is for them. Don't mistake that. - Good morning. - Yes. Good morning. Attention! I'm Murakami, business consultant. For this company to survive, we will hire an accounting agency. It is unavoidable to ask you all to leave this company. Pay check and arrangements for insurance... will be made later. What is this? We know it's a difficult time. But why 'it's the consultant to tell us? Instead of you? We've work for you all this time together. Huh? Say something! Satchan, let's go. - Come on. - Wait! He betrayed us. Don't say that. Ayako, come. - Coming. Ayako, well. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for coming here all the long way so early. President has a message. Gentlemen here today are all over 50. You are all in responsible posts... and your effort made this company what it is today. However, in the midst of this recession, business are closing. Even large companies. For our survival, we need to carry out a major restructuring. The board decided to request you all to voluntarily step down. This decision was difficult. But this is the only way to survive. We ask for your understanding. If you accept and step down, we will provide additional compensation pay. If you do not accept, you are welcome to stay. But your post will be outside duty. Please decide by the end of May. The human resources manager will give you more information later. Thank you. Stop passing the buck! Yeah! "Six months later" April 6th, rain, later clouds. Mom's starting school. Mon in her white clothes, dressed pretty to school. Now, everyone, introduce yourself. Hashimoto. I worked 35 years in an insurance company. 2 years to retirement, but they made me step down. So I'm here. I ran a factory in Arakawa, doing sheet metal work. Business failed and closed last spring. So I'm here to start over again. I ran a bar, price became business over quality. Banks refused to lend, eventually I ran out of money, so I quit. Studying at my age is hard, but I'll try my best. My name is Kim Yong Su. Okay to call me Kim. I ran a small store selling electronics, then a large store opened nearby. Business turned bad and... I had to close my store. I live with my grandmother... but her pension isn't enough. So I'm here. Now the only lady here, Kojima. I'm Kojima. Only lady here. The interviewer said physical work maybe hard, but I'm quite strong. I'll try to do as well as you all for next six months. Takano. My name is Takano. Hata. I'm Hata. Parent company cut cost, which hit us and I had to leave. So I'm here. Rain stopped later. I hate rain. Because the newspapers will get wet. Hanzonmon, Hibiya, Marunouchi. Do subway have tunnels? North or south hemisphere? Behave! Tommy, are you okay? I told you, not to ride in the middle. I didn't. Okay? Aunt, Tommy fell from the bicycle. Again? We delivered the newspapers together. Thank you. Take your bicycle. Ken, stay for dinner. I have class. Gotta go. Say "hi" to mom for me. Are there tunnels in Paris? Special dishes today. "Itadakimasu"? Itadakimasu.

Come home at 5? Toast for school! Cheers. Cheers. Tasty? Look this is textbook for studying. Very hard. Is boiler English? Yes. Why written in Katakana? Maybe Americans can't read Kanji. Itadakimasu. - Yes? - It's me. Oh hi. Hi Tommy. Dinner done? - Done. - Not yet. Good. I brought some Tempura. Yes. Looks delicious. Thanks. How was school? Never thought I'd go back at this age. All the pains. One after another. I'll probably get by like always. Come in. No I can't. Good luck. Thanks. No sauce, no mayonnaise. Tasty? I'm not young, I don't need anything fancy. Just a secure job, with stable employment. Not part-time, not temporary, full time. Just enough money for me and my son, to make living, I take hard work. Those jobs, up there... cleaning job for woman over 45, all part-time or temp. I need security. Help me. What about vocational schools? Vocational schools? If you finish the degree, offers better chance. How much does it cost? Expensive? It's free. And with allowances. Here is a building. Sorry for my bad drawing. Before, most of you worked in... this section of the building. When you graduate... And work in a building, this section, where the big boilers and transformers are, Will be the section where you work. Remember that you're not... in offices with ties, it's different. You get paid much less, maybe half or even a third. Takano, please change your clothes. My clothes? As I have said before, you will be working in... Fine. Maintenance is literally the base. As you study this course, Tell yourself that you support... the safety of building and its people. You are older, your memory maybe half or a third, you have to work harder. It's hard... but do your best and finish this course. I'll do it. Let me, I like serving. Terrible tea. I'll bring better tea. - Some tea? - No thanks. This is fire tube boiler. Currently most common type of boiler. This one uses gas but crude oil is common. Now, we will use this boiler for class. This is the tiling classroom. In here, we learn about electricity. Building's transformers and boilers, freezers, and operation of automatic controllers. Tomorrow, class schedule will start. There is a lot to learn in a very limited time, so please prepare for class. Class dismissed. Takano, we are deciding... our turns for cleaning, can you stay while we decide? Cleaning? Why do I have to? Why? Because it's our classroom. Go ahead. I have plans. It will only be a few minutes. Finance section? I'm Takano, Arai manager's friend. Is he in? What time will he return? Okay. I'll call later. Tell him I called. Say, that Takano, he probably used to boss around. And a lot of money at retirement. It's open. Let's go for a beer. I have to cook for my son. Then, Kim.

I'll be right there. Tommy did something again. Tommy, I'll be out. Be right back. Phone doesn't stop, 20, 30 so many calls, they're really upset about old newspapers. Big trouble. We're redelivering. Yamamoto, leave that, go now! What to do? I'll go and apologize. - What? - Let me. Excuse me. Yomiuri Shimbun. My son delivered old newspaper by mistake. I'm really sorry. Who is it? Excuse me. My name is Kojima, my son delivered old newspaper by mistake. I brought new newspaper. Leave it in. I'm very sorry. Excuse me. I'm Kojima, my son delivered old newspaper by mistake. I'm very sorry. I'll tell him not to. Your son? That mumbling boy? He's handicapped. He scares my kid, disturbs his study. Does he have to work?

"Correct reason, for setting the major axis... of elliptical manhol in direction of... the boiler tube circumference." This is a common exam question. Any one? Hashimoto. Stress to the circumference... is double to that of axis. Therefore it's safer. Question? What's "stress"? Is it pressure? Back in page 39. Power to pull and bend things with pressure. Wrong units. "cm2", and "mm2". Just remember "stress". Now, on the types of tubes. There are 5 types chosen depending on the use. Exam question. Kojima. Yes. Read? "Smoking pipe". I first thought so too. It didn't make sense. It means "fire tube" here. These are in the boiler water... filled with gas. Water tube. Water is inside, combustible gas is outside, used in water tube boilers. Hello? Finance section? Is Arai manager in? I'm a friend of his. Takano. Is he in? Thank you. It's me, Takano. Sorry, I called many times. You busy? Did you talk to the president of Marui Securities? What? What about my age? Before, you said it was okay. Why now it is a problem? You should have told me earlier. Arai, can we meet for a minute? I know you're busy, just a few... Hello? Wow! Takano. Are you there? I just saw him walking out. It's his turn to clean today. Does he know? Hello? ls Arai manager there? I called several times, Takano, a friend from school, In meeting... Please, it's quite urgent, can you...? You can't. Fine. Tell him that... Takano will never call again! Thanks! Takano. It's your turn to clean today. You forgot? I had plans. Why didn't you tell us then? "Self-ism" is not good. Such word doesn't exist. Can't you talk nicely? Why don't you mix with the others? Why should I? No rule. Unpleasant We don't care if you don't, but don't disturb others. Complaining, Kojima said she will clean on your behalf. Go thank her. Let's go now. I cannot forget, I love him. Old song. Reminds me of good times. I had my love. Really? I'm very sorry. I will do it. Don't worry. Can you do it? No problem. Wait, wait! Look. Wash inside first, then squeeze. Not so hard! Give me that.

Thank you. Know where to put the mop? Yes. Next to the toilet. Goodbye. That guy is just selfish. Common guy nature. Wonder what his wife is like... Jerks like him often have beautiful wives. Dumb women. Yamazaki Metal 930 yen, buy 20 million. Got it. Turn out Yamazaki Metal, sell two million. 803 yen. Sold? Barge is strong. Sell. Meeting at 6? Sold? Thanks. Sawako Kojima. "Common exam question." You came? You told me to. How? On bicycle. How's mom? Bad business, bad mood. You hungry? Eat. You're eating this? Pitiful. Nagashima manager has 7 pitchers... Dad, you remember Nagashima playing? Yeah, went to see his games. Remember when he quit? I was 26. I became manager that year, so I remember clearly. Wanna drink? Underage. He hits! To the left field! He hit! Big one to left, but... stopped! What! Hajime, that freshman year, you said you want to become a chef. Yeah. I said, you should go to college no matter what, and you cried in fury. Uh-huh. I shouldn't have said that, I regret now. The value of people isn't just college education. Don't become a white collar! That's why you called me to come here? You only live once, so treasure it. Too late to regret at my age. Listen, I also have a lot of things that I want to say. But I'm not saying it. So quit lecturing. What do you want to say? To say that you also were a victim? Dad, stop drinking. Makes me miserable. That hill? Thanks. Hello. Hi! Why are you here? You forgot your textbook. You can't study during the holidays... Textbook. So you brought it for me? I like bicycling around. So I just stopped by. Goodbye. Thanks a lot. Sawako, invite him for tea. He came a long way. Takano, wait. Hey, Takano! Yes... I was surprised. Wondered why you were here. Did I disturb you? No, I wanted to study and I need the textbook. Didn't know you were kind. Me? You always look sullen in class... and you never talk. Thought badly? We were saying, you probably bossed around before. - Really... - Please. Tell me why did you quit? They condemned employees over 50. I was so enraged. Sol resigned in anger. I thought, heck, there are other companies that need me. Big mistake. You couldn't find any? Unemployment office introduced that school. So that's why you're studying... with other unemployed from dinky company like me. I was hung over on the first day of school. You looked gloomy. You remember? Of course. You were late. I also remember being surprised to see you. Just kidding. - Is Mr. Kojima out? - He's there. He died 10 years ago. My son is home. What if I poop on a Shinkansen? You can't do something like that. We have guest. My school classmate. Nice to meet you. Tommy, say hello. Hello. Where is America? Uh... America? Are there tunnels in America? Tunnels? I don't know why he's interested in tunnels and caves. He's been like this since he was a kid. Choo-choo-choo Tommy How many tunnels in Sanyo line? I got you ice-cream. What if I pee on a frying pan? We have a guest. Itadakimasu. He was a healthy pretty baby. Never dreamed that he was handicapped. Please. When did you? When he was 2. Something's wrong. Words were clear but... Didn't take me in. No eye contact, and didn't hold me. When I took him to hospital, doctor said, "typical case of infant autism". I see. It was a hot day. On the way home, my face was wet from sweat and tears. He's grown so much since, same thing everyday, except our age. Do you worry? About the future? Yes. But I know I will die someday and, I think he will somehow find a way to live on his own. Optimistic. I never wished... him or myself to be dead. Except, once I thought, If we could die together, that'll be okay too. On a cable car in Zao, Tommy got scared, went berserk, I wished the cable to break and let us fall together. When I came home and told this to my husband, he got very angry. He was in tears with rage. That was the first and the last time I saw him so angry. Parents' feelings. l... l have a spoiled son. No. Actually I'm the one, I'm spoiled. You're up? - Sorry. How many tunnels in Tohoku line? Tohoku line. I'll find out later. How many tunnels in Argentina? Argentina. I'll find out that too. You're so earnest. I liked trains. If I'm 68, how old are you? 68? You're 16 now? What day is Saturday plus Saturday? Saturday plus Saturday? That's a hard one. Which bus goes to Tokiwadai via tunnel? Good bye. Thank you today. See you in class. Yes. Takano, don't be late for class. Always late. Not thought well of. I drink to sleep, a bad habit. I stay up late, can't get up by myself. Your family? I'm living alone, we're separated. Then, I'll call you in the morning. Will you? Bye, Tommy. Bye. Rocket in Mars. Explode, bang! Beautiful Many birds flying into sunset. Mom said. "Tommy, if we had wings, we'd fly away with them." Are people with wings human? Hello? Morning! Get up! Yes, yes. Thank you. Now look. To check if water level scale... Is working correctly on boiler, shut steam and water cock. Morning. Takano. You're early. This first. I see. Then, drain cock. Right, after draining, steam cock. Check steam, then shut. Water cock, check water, shut. Shut drain cock and done! Not yet. Open steam, warm up tubes, open water. Check water level. Done. - Impressive, Kim. - Thanks. Grave as a tax collector. Hi. Everyone, good news! A grandchild was born to Cho. - Congratulations! - Morning. Kita, from office? Why? Mr. Nomura called, he'll be late for a while. I'll be his substitute. Tell us a joke. You know my major? So, it has been 2 months, since you came. Any comments or complaints, about your classes? Please voice out. Yes. Anything? Sure. l... l don't understand anything. It's too fast. All the jargons, enthal-pee, etc. Slips me. Incontinence? Thought studying will make me smarter. Yes. But the more I study, the more confused I am. I feel more and more stupid. I agree. It's really not funny! I understand. You're tired. And the weather's getting hotter. Cheer up! Let's talk about... something else about "tools". Electricity and boiler. These are one of many tools we created, in order to better our lives. Chalk, black board, table, chair, car, train, etc. are all "tools" of ours. You know our ancestors are apes. 2 or 3 million years ago, our ancestor got on two feet. Grew tall. Remember the diagram? By standing, our hands were freed. Free hands. I can throw. Or swing sticks, throw these stones.. Use of "tools", made us different from animals. Sticks and stones lead to civilization. Then we found fire. Life rapidly improved. With fire, we made iron. Later, over 200 years ago, James Watt invented an engine... to convert steam pressure to power. In other words, "boiler". Your topic. So you ask yourselves, "Watt's boiler"? Everyone is listening. It was the dawn of modern technology. I just wanted to say what you're learning... is the essence of it, the end. I feel cheated. Interesting. If all classes were as fun. But don't ask that in exam. Good morning. Enjoy your class. Let us start. Page 27. Boiler maintenance. Article 24... He will be on his way. Here's the map. What's gotten into you? Unemployed, Told you, it's for work. I need to have some skills. Will that ensure you a job? I don't know. See! I'm saying it's unlikely. Consider your age. You're over 40. Get married. I'll arrange someone for you, I've been looking. This person. He's a friend of my father's. You wanted to tell me this? He's a nice person. His wife died a year ago. He needs someone. I told him about Tommy. He said one of his relatives has, you know... "slowish" child. So he's accustomed. Isn't he nice? Look, he's the second from the right. Little thinning. Auntie, thanks, but... What's look? Appearance only matters when you're young. When I met uncle, I thought, "yuck!" But I gradually got used to him. It's all about money at your age. He seems to have savings. - Excuse me. - Customer! I have to go to a meeting. Stay longer. Uncle's late. Have a seat. It's August. Wear lighter clothes. They are on cheap sales. Coffee for me. - Yes. Here, your dad's keepsake. It was in the cabinet. Wanted Hajime to give you. How's work? Bad. Bad sales. Banks don't lend. I fired a girl. Find a job? - No, not yet. You're still going to that school? - Summer holiday now. - Excuse me. How's Hajime? Cramming school. Is he okay? Hajime is far more capable than you think. - You just don't know. - I see. Retirement pay. This should cover all mortgage, and leave you change. Use it for Hajime's school... Takano speaking. How's it? Tell them I'll be there. Say hi to Hajime. Okay, I'll call again. - Oh, hi! - What are you doing? Uh... just eating doughnuts. Surprised to see you. Tommy, Mr. Takano. Hello Tommy! Hot, eh? Will you die? Surely, the heat is killing. Sometimes, he says strange things. When's your funeral? Mine? Maybe soon. Who'll come to your funeral? Important people, like Prime Minister. Stop kidding around. Tommy! Hi! My friend. Remember her? - Yes, hello. - Hello. We bumped into each other. Not to beach. Scary. I'll be there for you. We're off to the beach till tomorrow. Beach... sounds great. Sorry, we have to go. See you. Enjoy it! - Good bye. - Good bye. - Let's go. - Come on Ken. Antares, Scorpion... So long. Come to the beach with us. - What? - You have plans? No, no. Then come! - I'm not wearing pants. - What? I mean, swimming pants. Tommy's swimming! Hey, he's swimming! You okay? You know, Tommy likes tunnels. I know. Grand opening! Oshima tunnel opened! Euro tunnel opened! Yes! It opened! Ken, Tommy has a love? - He does. - Who? Tommy, you like Yuki? No I don't, I don't. When he says no, he means yes. Tommy's handsome. He was pretty as a girl baby. Really. What about your love, Ken? Me? Appropriately. Tommy, here that? "Appropriately". Father is probably necessary for boys. Let's go swim Tommy! Yes let's go Tommy! Hurry! It's not scary, come. Let me see Tommy. Pegasus, Pegasus. Pegasus. Tommy likes constellations. - Yes. - Why? It never changes. Never betrays him, never ever. Unlike people. Why moon? It wane and wax. It's been repeated for millions of years. He loves the moon. It doesn't betray him either. - Tommy, watermelon. - Yes. Touch head? What? You like my hair? You can touch it. Tommy, I told you not to bother her. It's okay. I don't mind at all. He wants to touch beautiful hair. I think I understand... sort of. Peculiar. - Stop it. - Tommy, Tommy, stop. Mommy's going to sing for you. Ready? Ai-Ai, Ai-Ai, little monkey. Ai-Ai, Ai-Ai, on southern island. Ai-Ai, Ai-Ai, with a long tail. Ai-Ai, Ai-Ai, little monkey An old song. - You know this song? - No. You were probably busy working. Kids' TV program song, very popular. Baby Tommy, responded to the song. So when he got alarmed, and went berserk, we sang this and it calmed him. Right, Sawako? I once dressed like the singer in the program. Tommy loved it. He wanted me to wear it all the time. If I didn't he would go berserk. So again I ended up doing "Ai-Ai". Few hundred times! Remember, when we went to a store, Tommy must have wanted a toy, he suddenly started hollering. So at the cashier, you stated "Ai-Ai", everyone around was shocked, but you had to keep on dancing and singing with all might. I was so hit by that, brought me tears. I'm so moved by your story. I can't speak. So let me sing. When the summer is over, I will be gone. When summer comes back, so will I. I don't like babysitting, for crying babies, because I get blamed for making them cry. Didn't know his character.. - You mean Takano? - Yes. Come on, he's typical, estranged by family by just devoting to work. Once retired, don't know what to do. Just like Tommy, his head is blank. - May I? - Come in. - Where to? - To see stars. Will you turn off the light? - Yes. Good night! - Good night! Great summer. Rape flower, blossoms, camellia... Hey, they're making fun of us. What's so funny? Stop laughing. Why do they... dye their hair? Feed enthalpy, divided by calorie equals 539. Equation of capacity To memorize, Ge=Gx(h2-h1) divided by 539. Very important. Now, boiler handling. Common exam question. Mr. Saito! Kojima. Police called. Your son had an accident. Go now. This hospital. Yes... yes. To Akabane. Go fast! Speed! Hear me? Wait! Use this. - Thanks. - Now, go! Go! That was a good move. Money helps. Unemployment allowance. Really used wisely. Tommy, TommY! I am his mother. How was the operation? Everything went well. Thank you. My son is handicapped. - Yes, we know. - Thank you. W... Where am I? Tommy, you ride on the left hand side. Not in the middle of the road. Or you get hurt like this. Left side. Will you die, will you... You're asking, "will I die"? You're okay, doctor said there is nothing wrong. You won't die, okay? Never. Not hurt, not hurt, not hurt, not... No, it doesn't hurt. Big boy. Strong boy. There are other people, we have to keep quiet. - I'm leaving. - Thank you. I was with him... sorry. Don't, it's not your fault. Take care Tommy. Russia, which way? That way, far away. - Bye bye. - Thanks. My son's name is Tomio Kojima. He has difficulties to communicate, and may cause you inconveniences, l ask for your understanding. May I take your temperature. Not hurt! Not hurt! Shirt... pajama... I'm back. I go home by Saturday? Not hurt! Not hurt! Big boy. Tommy's brave. So strong. Not hurt! Not hurt! W... Where am I? Damn it, can't sleep! Sorry to disturb. I came about my son. Come in, we wanted to know. Please. When speaking to him, please don't use childish words. It might feel like you're talking to a baby. But he has his 16 year-old pride. Please treat him like an adult. It's difficult for him to express himself, so sometimes he might do absurd things. But please try to see his needs, before you scold him out right. I'm really sorry for all the trouble. We understand. If he does something right, please praise him for it. Although not overly. You know? Of course. That's what child raising is. Yes? We'll be there. Room 307, drip is done. Hi. You came for me at this hour? Go home and sleep tonight, I'll watch him, many more days ahead. Thanks. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning, sleep till then. Studying? You came? I didn't know which hospital, thought I'd see you here. - How's Tommy? - He's okay. - Good. - Thanks. Come in. It's late... Come on, come in. Let me. Tired? - I'm glad you came. - Good. Good work. - Tastes so good. - What? I was imagining you buying this. As is. Ah. Mr. Saito wished you well. Today's class was especially difficult. I'll teach you. I got I after someone taught me. Sleepy? Let's stop. - I'm fine. Teach me. - Page 125. You asked about the number 539 calories. At reference point? Correct. 539 calories at reference point. You have to memorize it. - You okay? - Yes. Example question. Take notes as I read. Feed enthalpy h1, is 18 kilo calories. If G is 3500kg per hour, in boiler at pressure of 5kg per cm2, what is the correct scale evaporation? Here, vapor enthalpy h2, for 5kg per cm2 is 657.9 kilo calories. - Answer 1 is 6578... - Kojima? Dear everyone, I appreciate, everything you have done for me. My son's wounds are healing well. Have you started looking for jobs? Hello. Air-conditioner maintenance. How is job availability? TV news and newspapers always talk of unemployment and closures, it worries me. Will the time come, After working day and night, to see peaceful retirement? Will it ever come? I wonder as I see the elderly in hospital. It kills me. Pink circles mean exam questions. How was school today? Morning exercise. Weather was good. Afternoon class was difficult. Lunch was catered. Very tasty. Sounds like Tommy's essays. Went to restaurant. Drank juice. Tasty. Train was fun. Oooh God. Will I get better? I'm fed up. It's Autumn skill festival soon. I'm hoping to go back before that... to catch up with class. See you then, all the best, Sawako Kojima. September 7th, clear sky. I went to mom's school. Nobody was in uniform. Is it really school?
