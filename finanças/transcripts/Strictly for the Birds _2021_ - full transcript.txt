When we are told all of our lives that there are only two possibilities, either, or, it can be hard to look beyond that. Some of us think outside the box. But for many of us, the box becomes our world. There is no outside the box. If someone had told me I'd play myself in a movie about my life, I'd have laughed. Thank god I did. I'd been off into the world. I have become more open to myself. Watch your step. ♪ Feeling change in the wind ♪ ♪ Golden fields, tall grass ♪ ♪ Find the sun here ♪ Watch out for the wall.

Between my age and my background. I'll be living alone the rest of my life, and that's okay, you know. That's, this is nice. I can learn to be me. Excuse me. Hi there. - Oh hi. - My name is Zoey, and I live right down here. I wonder if I could ask you for a favor. Uh, okay. What kind of favor? Well, I have this problem. I can't reach the top shelf of my kitchen cabinets. And for some reason, best known to himself, when my son comes over, he puts everything up there, and he doesn't seem to realize that they're empty for a reason. He's got a tall wife, and he seems to forget that he has a short mom. So I was wondering if you could reach some stuff for me. Please. Okay, I'm Kate, by the way. It's nice to meet you. And this is my partner Max. - My best friend. - Hi Max. Okay let's go down here. Okay. I gotta tell you, I really admire that you're tall. As a matter of fact, I envy your height. It's very challenging to be this short. Oh, I would think so. Absolutely. But I don't think I'm gonna grow at this point. - I think. - Oh probably not. This is a great place to live. I think you're gonna like it here. Everybody cares about everyone else. It's like we're living among old people, but we don't realize we're old. Who are all these old people? It's right over there. This cabinet on the top shelf. So didn't I see you at First Unitarian last week? No, I just moved in. Oh, where'd you come from? Laramie, Wyoming. Wow, Wyoming. Does everyone dress like that in Wyoming? No, most people wear jeans. Well, that's pretty unique, I'll say that. - Okay. - Thanks a lot, you know? I keep meaning to get a stool, and I keep forgetting. But now with neighbors like you, who needs a stool, right? Right, well, I'm glad to help. Well how about sticking around and having a cup of tea? - I have, I have... - Oh come on, come on come on. Just say yes. It's just a cup of tea, no commitment. Okay, yeah, sure. Okay, let me get some. How about some cheese and crackers with that? Oh, alright. Mm, now that I think of it, how about some wine instead? Sure, why not? You know, one of the good things about getting old is that we can drink whenever we want. We don't have to ask anyone's permissions. Oh that's plenty. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. So did you come here alone, Kate? I did. My partner died four years ago. I'm really sorry to hear that. Well yeah, thanks. But you know, just in case you might be interested, I know a lot of single people. Oh, I don't need that. Thank you very much. Well, amen to that. Have some more wine, Kate. It's good for you.

I saw Sue this morning. They're back from their trip. Oh, where'd they go this time? I forget. Montana, doesn't matter. I have to tell you something. Well, before they went on their trip, John and I got together, and we went hiking. It was wonderful. We had this fabulous trip, and we stopped at this perfect spot. And well, it proceeded and let me tell you, John has a lot of stamina. There we were, you know. Really going at it. Good grief, woman. Don't you know you're not supposed to put your paws on some other woman's husband? No, he's not married. Well, then have at it. You will, anyway. Oh, Andrea. Hi. - That was gorgeous. - Oh thank you. - Just gorgeous. - Thank you, thanks very much. We have some new people. Yeah, I thought I saw some new faces over here. Do you know Zoey? No, no, hi Zoey. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. And this is Kate. Hi Kate. Hi Andrea. Nice to meet you. Oh, my pleasure. - Please stay, have a seat. - Come on, have a seat. - Join us. - Oh we want to see you. - Alright. - Have a seat, have a seat. Meet Kate. Your public wants you. Really nice evening, huh? Yeah, yeah, it's been a really great evening. So, I haven't seen you at one of our concerts before. Oh yeah, I just moved to Portland. You were great, by the way. Oh, thanks. Maybe you'd like to join us sometime. Oh no, I ruined my voice years ago. You don't want to hear me sing. Oh well, if you ever change your mind, come on over. Okay. So, I noticed you. I've been admiring your earrings and your necklace. It's very pretty. Thank you. I was afraid maybe I'd dressed too loud for the occasion. No, no. Anything goes around here. So, no problem. Have you lived in Portland long? Yeah, I have. How many years has it been now? 42 years. Oh wow. Yeah. Almost a native. So what are those guys talking about? I really don't know them. You don't know them? - My favorite subject. - Yeah. They seem to be enjoying themselves. They do seem to be enjoying themselves. I am too. Oh yeah, me too. Feeling a little shy, though. Oh, yeah, me too. Is Lilly always that way? - Yeah. - Oh. When we met the other day, I thought to myself, what an interesting person. I'd really like to get to know her. Oh. Well, I don't know how interesting I am. So, Lilly told me you'd been in the Coast Guard. I was. - 21 years. - Wow. I was in the Army, too. But I liked the Coast Guard, better. Must have been interesting to be out there on a ship with all those guys. Ha, well. Most of my stations were on shore. So what brought you to Portland? Well, I wanted to be closer to my daughter. She's up in Olympia. I wanted to be able to see her more than once a year. I think I also wanted to be in a bigger place. So you're starting over. Yep, 68 years old. It took me a long time to get here. Oh gosh, after my divorce, I moved to Portland. And I worked as a librarian, for 15, maybe 20 years. And then I started my own business. And here I am. Well, it seems funny that we can sum up our lives in just a few sentences. Yeah. We all know that there's more to it than that, - but, yeah. - Yeah. We've lived long lives, Kate. Yep. This is a nice place you got here. Well thanks. Do you have it all to yourself? Yeah, I do. I don't have any roommates, and I don't have a boyfriend. Just some good girlfriends and my business. Yeah, sometimes relationships can get so complicated. You want to live life. I want to live life. Well, I hope you do. You're so cute. You're pretty cute yourself. Oh thanks. Hello? Oh hi, Kate, this is Andrea. Oh, Andrea. Good morning. Hi. I hope I didn't wake you up. Oh, no. I'm up. I was thinking about going shopping today for some clothes, and I wondered if you'd like to go with me. Oh, yeah, sure. Okay. I could get some things too. Well don't sound too excited. Oh no, I'd like to go with you. It sounds like fun. Well you get your breakfast, and I'll pick you up a little after noon. Okay, okay, bye. Bye. How do you think that works? It's nice, I like it. Alright. I liked it, too. Well here's one I think really delivers your message. Wow, classy and feminine. Well, I always thought clothes made the woman. Puberty can be tough. Getting the wrong puberty can be even worse. And if you don't have people around you who understand, it can be devastating. I made dinner. Looks nice. How is it? Really good. It's perfect. No, let me. Thank you. Are you okay? I'm fine. No. Something's wrong. Not really. Sorry. Give me some more. Al? Al. Your father's on his way home. So you two should get cleaned up. Why didn't you tell me? You're moving? My dad told me you're moving. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't know, either. Not until my mother told me like a week ago. But, my dad got a job in Indiana. So we have to go, too. I'm sorry. I'm never gonna have a friend like you again, am I? Listen. They're gonna tear the house down. So... Let's go downstairs one more time. Okay. Albert was leaving. His house was getting torn down for the freeway. Our secret haven was being taken away. It's just so unfair. ♪ I think myself a lucky man ♪ I never saw Albert again. And it would be more than 50 years before I told anyone about playing in his basement. Over the winter of 1983, I was an engineer in the Coast Guard.

Well, you must be looking forward to Christmas. Excited about it? Not really. I can't fit my presents in my suitcase. So I can't take them home. Well, maybe that's okay. Maybe they'll just be here for you when you come to visit. What do you mean? Well, we were thinking that if you had your own room and some of your own things, that maybe you'd feel more comfortable to come visit, maybe a little more often. Oh. You know, your father wanted to get you something really special, and we thought you'd like it. You know, when I was little, I was lucky to get a good job from my parents once a year, much less a new bicycle. You should be grateful. Casey. Oh, just let her cool down, Dan. She's just tired.

Your mother and I, we decided that we would, well, it'd be better for you, and it'd be better for her, if you stayed. Well you know, your school, your friends. But why did you leave me? Sweetie, I wish it had been different. I don't know, hon. It's just, I'm sorry. I am Major Hoffman. Of the funeral staff. Oh you are? And why didn't you bring your funeral with you?

It was fun spending time with your friends. Thanks for including me. Oh, you're welcome. I'm glad you could come over. They're fun. Yeah, they are. So this is on me. - Yeah? - Yeah. You don't have to do that. I want to. Okay, well I'll get the next time. Okay. So what sounds good to you? If I get the dead guy wings, will you share with me? No. No, that's entirely too messy. Oh, yeah. You could get 'em. Yeah, but you're probably right. Maybe I'll get the, well, I don't know. Casey's coming soon. I'd love for you to meet her. I would very much like to meet her, too. She sounds like a wonderful girl. Oh, I think so. I'm very lucky. Are you still in touch with Casey's... I... Not very often. They were with me through the tough times. We're friends. That's nice. So, since we're telling each other stories about our past relationships, I'll tell you about my first marriage. It was really quite awful. A couple years into it, I met another teacher, and we had an affair. Turned out to be seven of the nine years that I was married. When I was 29, I realized that I couldn't stay married to two guys for the rest of my life. And so, I divorced 'em both and moved to Oregon. Oh, good for you. Well, that was a long time ago. Yeah, it was. You know, I think we make the best decisions that we can at the time. Yeah. And they end up being our stories. And without them, we wouldn't be where we are now. That's true. I like where we are today. Yeah, I do too. I'll just get my keys. After we'd lived in Laramie for a couple of years, Linda got sick. Now, I'll be right back. The diagnosis was that it was terminal. Unless she could stop drinking. After several tries, she gave up, resigned to her fate. Oh... Where is it, where is it, where is it, where is it, where is it? God damn it! No no, no no, no no no no no no no, no no. Where is the opener? I threw it away. Well then I'll just push the cork down. I've done it plenty! That's pathetic! You're pathetic! What would Casey think if she knew about you? If she knew you liked to wear women's clothes! - You're killing yourself! - I bet she'd love to know that! Linda, you are killing yourself. You are. As she became sicker, I had to spend more and more time taking care of her. She resented that. Is it too hot? Well it's, a little bit. - It'll be okay. - Okay. Thank you. After Linda died in '07, I worked to put my life back together. She and I had been good together, but her decline had stretched me all too close to breaking. I blamed her and her drinking for the misery of the last few years. And I blamed myself for my inadequacies in helping her. Your succulents are fake. I'm sorry for your loss. I don't know what to say at these things. It's okay, Bruce. She was too young. But, you're gonna feel better. You're gonna be okay. Thank you, it's nice of you to say that. I needed to hear it. Oh, and thank you for all of your help today. And if you need anything else, you know, I'll do whatever. Right, thank you. Thanks for coming. Of course. Okay. Let us know if you need anything, okay? I will, thank you for coming. No problem. See you in church, okay? Okay, alright. Doing okay? Yeah. Did you at least get something to eat? I'm just glad it's over. Well, it was a beautiful service. You did a great job. Thank you. I'm glad you could come up for this. Me too. I wanted to be here. Is that your old bike? Yeah. Yeah. The... Brings back memories, doesn't it? Linda and I rode everywhere. That's how we found Laramie. We went out to the Rocky Mountains, and just started thinking of moving West. Dad. I'm sorry that Linda and I were never that close. Look, I know that was a difficult relationship for you both. I wanted to like her. I did, I just... It was a tough time. There is this. Well, I hate to even say this, but there's a small part of me that's relived that... I feel guilty for even thinking that. I mean, that's... That's bad, isn't it? No. You loved her so much. You took care of her for so long. Now it's time to live your life. Can I tell you something? I need to tell you something. Yeah, of course. I wish I had mentioned it a long time ago. Okay. I find comfort in wearing women's clothes. Some of this still doesn't make sense to me, but I've grown to accept it. Some things just don't make sense. Here. What do you think? Well, it's age appropriate. I suppose it is. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Are you okay? I'm okay, I'm okay. - Okay. - Are you okay? Yeah, I will be. - Okay. - Alright. Come on, let's forget this. Okay, show me that bike. Hey Kate. Are you okay? Oh yeah. I'm fine. I just, I'm a little in my head this afternoon. Would you like me to let you go home to take a nap? Oh, no. No, no, I'm having a wonderful time. So am I. So am I. This is really, really pretty. It is a pretty place. Beautiful picture. Looks like Wyoming. It is. I love that painting. Great, appreciate it. It's nice to be here. Well, I'm glad you're here. This must be Casey. Yeah, that's her. Yeah... I loved her the moment she appeared. And I wasn't always there when she was crying out. I had a little growing up to do myself. Want to see my flutes? Yeah. That's beautiful. So that's what I was saying. What makes it unusual is that it's white oak, almost all the floors you see are red oak, and those are white, white oak. God, did I tell you about trying to permit my greenhouse? And you know what, that's invasive. You should tear that out. I don't know plants. Well, it shouldn't be there. It looks nice what you did with it, but it should go. So between the setbacks from the property line, and the minimum distance between buildings, I don't have a greenhouse big enough to do anything, and let alone, do all my research. But you know, well what the heck? Who are they to say? And the thing is, you don't even need a permit for an agricultural building out in the county. But in the city, you can't get an agricultural permit. - Hey Bruce, Bruce. - What? Bruce, can I, look, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. I'd like to tell you something about myself. Okay. I'm transgender. What does that mean? Well, when I was little, I wanted to be a girl. But I didn't know how it worked. I just thought my body would heal itself. Shut up. I've dressed in women's clothes most of my life. I don't know how far I'll pursue this, but it's time for me to be more open about it. How much time do you think you have left? Maybe 30 years? - Well... - 20? Yeah, yeah I hope so. That's a long time to not be happy. - Yeah. - Right? I suppose it is. You're gonna stay though, right? You're not gonna move off somewhere. Yeah, I need my home, and my friends, my community. Okay, okay. Those will be imperative for me to feel like I can move forward. 'Cause I got your back here. If you go off to... - Right. - San Francisco. I don't know. Thanks Bruce. You know, when you pull that out, you gotta get the roots, too. You gotta take it all the way down, and you gotta watch it, and if it comes back, you gotta pull every bit of it. Maybe you ought to burn it. - Okay. - I'll do it. - Okay. - I'll do it tonight. Do it, I'll go make more cookies right now. Alright. It seems like everyone has always wanted me to be something else. Even I have wanted it. But Andrea seems to want me to just be me. There's a bench over here. Do you mind if we sit down? No, that'd be fine. Beautiful here. Oh, it sure is, Kate. So, Kate. I have the sense you were born into a male body. Well, you're right. I thought of it as being out of register. You know, like when the colors of an image don't line up. Somehow, wearing women's clothes gave me a break from pretending to be a man. The pressure kept building to do something. When I was finally able to transition, it was just, amazing. It was so wonderful. I'm so proud of you. Bless you. You're just wonderful. Am I? Kate, you're such an interesting and complex person. Am I? Yeah, you are. It's funny, I was always so forgettable as this guy, but people seem to remember me now. You're wonderful. Well, I don't know about that. Well, I think you're wonderful. Thank you. There's something I've wanted to tell you today. You remember a couple weeks ago, we got to sit next to each other in church for the first time. ♪ Sing in my heart ♪ Well, we were singing "Spirit of Life," and at some point, your voice dropped into its natural baritone register. ♪ Lies in the sea ♪ ♪ Move in the hand ♪ ♪ Giving life the shape of justice ♪ ♪ Truth hold me close ♪ ♪ Grace, set me free ♪ I literally felt my heart crack open. It was a physical sensation. And I looked at you and I said to myself, "You have just fallen in love with this woman." Really? Yeah, really. But you've always been with men. I know. I know. I've been married to two men. But now I find that I have fallen in love with a transgender woman. I think I've scared you. Well, well, I, I, I didn't expect this, Andrea. Well, Kate, I didn't expect it either, but here we are. Let's just see where this goes. Oh, okay, okay. You don't need to say anything. Take care. I love you. Ah. See if my knees will work. It's easy to love Andrea. She's just so smart and kind and confident. It's harder to accept that she loves me. But I need to be free. Do I dare to try to love someone, to make space for her to love me? Oh gosh, what's, what's up? Uh oh. Hello? Oh hi Zoey, it's Andrea. Andrea, hi, what's up? Well, it's about Kate. Kate? What happened to Kate, what's wrong? She's fine, she's fine. It's just that I told her tonight that I love her. So wow, do you love her? Yeah, I do. Well, that's cool. So what's the problem? Well, I'm not supposed to fall in love with a woman. Oh baloney, come on. Man, woman. You know, it doesn't really matter. The big gift is love. You find love, you gotta go for it. Oh my gosh. But what if I scared her? Really? Kate's been in the Army, she's been in the Coast Guard. I doubt that she scares so easily. Well, she sure didn't say anything back. I think she just didn't know what to say. She didn't know what to do with that. Well, you know she's more reserved. But I think she's got the hots for you. Do you think so? It's obvious. You'd have to be blind not to notice it. Wow. Well, it's sure taken my by surprise. Well, we gave you some space. The rest is up to you. I should let you go to sleep. I think, I think I'll be fine, and I think that I'll get a good night's sleep, and I think, I think I love her. No worries. I got a really good feeling about this, so just want you to know that. Goodnight, dear. Now what, Max? These people... Hello? Hey Zoey, it's Kate. Ah Kate, what's up? I didn't wake you up, did I? Wake me? Nah, I was just reading, like I always do in the middle of the night. Oh, oh good. Well, it's Andrea. What about Andrea? Is something wrong? Oh, everything's fantastic. She told me she loved me tonight. Oh wow. That's cool. So what'd you do? Well I didn't know what to say. I was just, I was floored. I mean, it was, I didn't know that was a possibility. Well, you know, I hope I didn't screw anything up. Oh, I'm sure you didn't screw up. Andrea's a smart cookie. She'll get it. Yeah, well I, I'm a woman now. I thought I'd fall in love with a man, but here's Andrea. She's wonderful. You know, as you always tell me, what's so great about men? Yeah. But, just so you know, I have a really good feeling about this. I want you to know that. Oh, oh thank you. I hope so. So can I go back to sleep now? Oh, okay Zoey. Thanks. Relax. Bye. Geeze, Max. Really, these people, they're nuts. Not like my dog. You're a wise boy. These are for you, mom. I know you don't like flowers, dad. I didn't bring you any. The trees have grown a lot since I was here last. I didn't really want to come by. Not because, well... If you could see me, you would see things are a little different. When I was young, you told me I was a boy. Though I didn't doubt that I was male, I could see that, but... Somehow I knew that I should be a girl. That I would be happier as a girl. That I would fit into the world better as a girl. I didn't know how bodies worked, of course. I remember when I was little, being always so hopeful each night when I went to bed. Before falling asleep, I would just, I would think, well, perhaps tonight is the night when this extra stuff just falls off. Like how a scab falls off when the skin underneath heals. Well then everyone would see that I'm a girl. But I want to tell you both now that, I've finally figured it out. I'm just sorry that I wasn't able to get it all together soon enough to show you. 'Cause I think your reaction would be, "Well, now it all makes sense." I just want you to know that your troubled and troublesome third child, who could never really quite find himself, well, she has turned out alright. So I was finally done. I didn't know if this day would ever come. I was ready to move on to my life as Kate. Sometimes it's easier if I act as if you'd never been. But I wouldn't have gotten here without you, Danny. I love you. Are you feeling okay? Yeah. I feel pretty good, actually. - Yeah? - All things considered. I even took a few steps around the room, and that's... That's good. Well, Dr. Bauer said that she did a great job, and that the surgery was a success. Yeah. - Yeah, she told me that too. - That's good. Casey, I know this is hard on you. But I'll always be your father. You know, a few months ago, I went to visit my friends down in the South, and it was just so wonderful to walk down the street as a woman. No hiding, no shame. Sometimes a man would open, hold the door open for me. And it felt real nice to be treated as a lady. People have been so kind to me. And I know, I know that not everyone's journey is like mine. But it just seems like this secret that I held so tightly, hid so well for 65 years, was far more interesting to me than to anyone else. It's been two years since I got to be Kate. It's been wonderful, beyond my wildest dreams. Andrea sure is a gift. Maybe certain people come into our lives to help us be who we are, and to help us get to be who we can be. You're beautiful, Kate. I'm glad you think so. I wish you could see yourself as beautiful. I'll try. You say it. I'm beautiful? Say it like you mean it. I'm beautiful. You are beautiful. I don't think you would've gone through all of this if you didn't think you were beautiful. Well, it became more a matter of survival. I didn't know how much longer I'd make it as, what's his name. I like you just as you are, Kate. Well, I sure didn't expect this. Oh, I didn't expect this, either. You want to take your jacket off? I haven't done this in a while. I haven't either. You might have questions. Whatever is just fine. Stuck. You have a tattoo. Come with me. I'm not that heavy. Here I come. Hi Kate. Hi Andrea. I have a Yoga class first thing Monday morning, so I just took off. Oh, I had wondered where you'd gone. Yeah, I'm sorry to worry you. Oh, that's okay. Would you like to come in? Oh, no thanks. I can only stay for just a second. Everything okay? Well... Yeah, I guess so. But, would you be okay if we took a break here for a little bit? What kind of break? Well, I don't know. One of my brothers is in town for a little while, so I'd like to at least wait until he's gone, and, see how I'm feeling. Okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry. I'll be in touch, okay? Actually, that's not it at all. I'm struggling here, Kate. I'm not supposed to have fallen in love with a woman. But I have. And I'm not sure what to do about it. I need some time to sit with that, and, I'm sorry. It's okay. Thank you. I will be in touch. I'll call you. - Okay. - Okay, bye. Hello, this is Andrea. Please leave a message, - and I will call you back. - Andrea opened the door to love. Loving me has to be way outside her comfort zone. But whatever happens, it was really wonderful to have that little glimpse of the sweet, powerful love that she offered. Oh Katie, where did you come from? Where did you come from? You sure you live here? This is it. Wow. I love it. Yeah, it's the first time I used a designer. Alright. Can I? Sure, go ahead. So do you want to go somewhere tomorrow, or do you just want to hang out? I'm okay with whatever. How are you and Thomas doing? He's gone back to school. Oh, that's good. That's good. Mama Kate, you're acting more like my father today. It's weird, but I'm kinda happy to have him back. You said a few months ago that I'm pretty much the same. Well, Papa had this... I don't know, I guess you'd call it, like, an underlying sadness. And when you got to me, Mama Kate, I didn't see that anymore, but today, I see it again. Well, these last few weeks, I've just been bolling over with happiness. I didn't know one person could even be that happy. I met a friend, and she's become more than a friend. And I, I'm waiting for her to come to her senses, and leave me. Why would you say that? Well, I bring a lot of baggage with me, and maybe I'm too old to start all this again. I can be happy living alone. Mama Kate, I'm on my second marriage, right? And I'm going to make this work. I am going to give everything I have to make this one work. And if it doesn't, 'cause they don't always, at least I will know that I tried, and it sounds so dumb, but I know that I would love again. We can't help it, you know? It's like, how we're built. I'm glad for you, Casey. You've been through a lot. You know how your neighbor has a love bird? I thought it was a parrot. Mama, that's what love birds are. Oh. Anyways, they only have one of them, and they're not supposed to be alone. They don't do well. They get erratic in captivity. Some people are just meant to pair up. If you really like this person, as much as it seems you do, then I think that you should try and give everything you can to be with them. It's funny, Mama Kate. I feel like I can talk to you more than I ever could with Papa. Yeah. It's nice. Yeah. Oh Casey and her talk of love birds. Actually, all birds shed their feathers and replace them with new ones. Maybe that's what I've needed to do so that I could find love. And let myself be loved. So Tom. Yeah? And Tom Flynn, down. I've met someone. And I believe I've fallen in love. He was 10 for 14. Under 10 yards. That's the patience part we talked about. Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard you. You fell in love. Yeah, I've fallen in love. Her name is Kate. Really? Yep. You know, it seemed like you might be happier with a woman. Well Tom, it sure feels that way. I don't think I've ever been in love. Someone knocked it away. John Elway, he did a quarrel on that. There's a little more to the story. He's gonna spin right around. She was born transgender. - Really? - Yeah. Okay I'm gonna sit down. I better sit down for this, I can see. Oh Tom. She's just wonderful. One handed catch by Van Johnson. You know, the message I got from Dad, I'm sure it was Dad, was that I was supposed to fall in love with a man, be married to a man, and be taken care of by a man. Johnson makes the tackle, or the catch when he's down. So to fall in love with a woman has presented a challenge to me. You know, do I listen to my heart, do I listen to the message in my head? That's why Dan Reeves was so upset. And it's been a struggle, but it just comes down to my heart. I, I love her. And she loves me. What can be wrong with that? Would you get that? Sure? Oh, hi. You must be Casey. Are you Andrea? I am. Come in, please. Mama Kate's just putting some things away in the back. Let me get her for you. Hey Mama Kate, Andrea's here. She'll be really happy to see you. I'll be happy to see her, too. It's very nice to meet you. You too. Hi Andrea. Hi Kate. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? I think I'm gonna go lay down for a little bit. It was really nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Casey. Love you. Good luck. Can we sit down? Sure. Kate, the words to love songs have never made any sense to me. It was just like a language I didn't understand. Until I met you. And now I get it. I love you, Kate. Well, I feel like my life has just started, and I'm already pushing 70. Sometimes, I wonder if I'll even make it another 10 years. I want to make most of these years that I do have. Once I got to be Kate, I was living just the perfect life. I didn't think it was possible to be happier. But with you, I am. I love you, Andrea. I love you, Kate. I feel like such a mess sometimes. Oh, we all do. And I worry that I might lose my mind someday. If that happened, would you take care of me? I'd take care of you. We could take care of each other. Do you wish I hadn't transitioned? That I was still pretending to be a man? Oh Kate. I wouldn't have given you a second look, 'cause you're too short. Well. Hey, do you like road trips? I think a road trip with you would be fantastic. Do you know that Johnny Cash song, "I've Been Everywhere." ♪ I've been everywhere, man ♪ Yeah, I like Johnny Cash. Yeah, how'd you like to go to all those places in the song? All those places? How many are there? There are 92 of 'em. - They're all over the place. - Oh my gosh. Well, what's the closest one? I think Crater Lake. Well, that's just down the road. Do you want to go? I do.
