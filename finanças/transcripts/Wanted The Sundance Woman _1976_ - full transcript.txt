[rifle cocked] You're spending too much time on Etta Place, Charlie. We have other things to do. Well, I'm not quitting. I said I'd get her. I'm beginning to wonder just how important she is anymore. A girl gone wrong out of love for a bad man. The man's dead now. What more can she do? She has to pay for what she's already done. You really want to send that pretty girl to prison? Girl, man, dog, or horse, a criminal's a criminal. She broke the law. Well, we can't spend our whole lives on this one case. The railroad wants her. We still have a client. We have lots of clients. The Mexican government, for instance. -I'm handling it. -Good. I'll assign someone else to the Etta Place job. No one else. She is mine. We've covered 50 towns. There aren't that many more. I'll find her. DAVE: Pack, pack, pack, pack, pack. I keep telling Mattie we can get all new stuff in California. We don't have to keep all this trash. She loves these things, Dave. Oh? What do I love? Everything. Honey, you just love everything. Well, we don't know what kind of things we're going to find out there in California. [mimicking] Isn't she sweet? [laughing] ♪ Oh, Susannah ♪ ♪ Oh, don't you cry for me ♪ ♪ I'm going to Californ-I-A ♪ - ♪ With Mattie on my knee ♪ -Oh! -Banjo. -Mattie's better. I'm off. Now where are you going? Well, I have to check on when they're going to pick up all this stuff for shipping. MATTIE: Mm-hmm. Maybe waste some time saying goodbye? DAVE: Maybe. After all, I've known these old boys a long time, hon. Bye. [whistling] Etta. He's already spoiled rotten. [laughing] I know. We've been here nine years, and when we pull out next week, he won't even look back. Well, change, some kind of excitement. I thought I'd cured him of that. [chuckle] What about you? What about me? Did you get cured of your need for excitement, too? It's been a happy year for me. I don't know, Etta. I think there's still some wear in this dress. Come look at it. Oh, Mattie, you can't take every stitch. Give this one to the parson. He'll find good use for it. Oh, I don't know. ETTA: What's wrong? We didn't get out of here fast enough. There's two strangers in town. They're policemen if I ever saw one. Then we heard true. They're still going from town to town to see if I turned up. Dave, I thought we'd put all this running behind us. You did, but I guess I didn't. Out the back. Take the mare. MATTIE: Will you be all right? Look, we never heard of you. Bye-bye. Get out. I had a feeling this was going to happen when we took her in. Honey, she had no place else to go. We don't turn away old friends. You know that. Howdy. Something I can do for you? Hear you got a lady working for you. Yes, sir. Sure have. Showed up about a year ago? Well, uh, give or take a month, yeah, more or less. Wasn't it about a year, more or less? Uh, about a year and a month. About, give or take a month, yeah, yeah. Calls herself Annie Martin. That's right. Annie Martin. Annie B. Martin. Like to see her. Sure. Sure. Uh, Annie! Annie B! I call her Annie B. Annie B! Ah-- Forgot. She's not here right now. Try Mrs. Brennen's right down the street. Annie stays with her. Been there. Yeah. Well, I don't know what to tell you. Hey. What are you doing back there? They got a corral out back with no horse. Spotted a rider heading for the hills. -Man or woman? -Looked like long hair. Where's your horse? Supposed to be in the corral. Could be Etta Place. If she's on your horse, you got trouble, Mister. I don't know any Etta Place. We'll find out when we catch her. They're going to catch her. They're going to find out how we know her. [horse neighs] [neigh] Come on, baby. Did anyone see you? No, I was careful. What happened? [sob] They arrested him. Harboring a fugitive and helping you to escape. What did Dave say? He said he didn't know you. But of course they didn't believe him. Oh, Etta, our life together was so good. No more risks, no more trouble. And I ruined it. I wasn't planning on staying this long, believe me. Well, we thought you'd be safer here. What do I do now? I'll make it right, Mattie. I swear. I'll make them let him go. How? I'll give myself up. I'll make a deal with them. He couldn't live with that. You know him. He'd blame himself or me. I'll get him out somehow. Neither of you is going to be hurt because of me. I'll do something. Oh, Etta. I'm so scared. He's not going to prison, Mattie. I promise you. I promise you. [train whistle blows] Mrs. Wilkins, there's somebody here to see you about a room. -Man or woman? -Woman. Mm. Show her in. Come this way, please. This here's Mrs. Wilkins, and this here's the lady. How do you do? Uh, how do you do? My name is Bonnie Dorrance. I'm told you run a very fine boarding house. Best in town. That'll do, Rosa. Miss Dorrance and I will just chat for a while. But I thought I was going to clean up this room. Get. That'll do. That'll do. Go on. Etta, what in God's name are you doing here? Who told you where to find me? How'd you find out? Lola, I didn't know, I didn't know. What are you doing here? Running a-- boarding house. [laughing] I heard all kinds of stories. You were killed in Bolivia. You were hiding in Texas. You were in prison, New York, London. No. No. Oh, it's good to see you. Oh! Oh, you know, I used to hate you for being so beautiful. Then I figured that was disrespectful to the dead, but now you're alive. I hate you again. [giggling] Well, you can't stay here. And don't let on to anyone we know each other from before or slip and give a sign of it. -Here you go. -Mm-mm. -Oh, I forgot. -I have business in town. -Business? -I really do need a room. Don't you know you're the most wonted woman in America? Every lawman and his one-eyed brother is looking for you. Haven't you see these? Everywhere I go. Awful artist, isn't it? And that fella, what's his name? Riley that they brought in-- suspicion of helping you out. Now, Etta, they'll be breathing down your neck. Riley is Dave Baker. -Dave Baker? -Yes. Ah ha! I heard he changed his name and got respectable. And I ruined it for him. Well, what do you think you're going to do for him here, appear as a character witness? Etta, be sensible. Get while you can. That trial starts tomorrow, and I promise you it'll be fast. I promised his wife I wouldn't let them down. For Pete's sake, forget it! Charlie Siringo's got him. If he sees you, your life is not worth a Bolivian centavo. You head south tonight, hear? Just get across that border and into those mountains. I can't run out on him. Ben Lant was here a while ago. Ben? -Uh-huh. -Our Ben? Our Ben, the same. He's been riding with that fella Pancho Villa. Oh, he slipped into town a few months back, and we just kind of laughed and talked over old times, so I know. Now, if you can just get to him, honey. I'm sorry, Lola. I've got to find a way to get Dave out. But Charlie Siringo is no fool. Charlie Siringo doesn't know what I look like. As for these, I'm grateful they're not flattering. Awful picture. All that with Butch and the boys, that's behind me now. I'm going to leave it that way. Of course. As far as anybody around here knows, huh, I'm a retired actress from Buffalo, New York, named Lola Wilkins, who runs the finest boarding establishment in the territory. I won't give you away. Which of the other boarding houses should I try? Well, there's Minnie Hansen's. But she's a terrible cook. Miss Larks is a filthy woman. She can't clean. You know you can't take dirt. Oh, Etta, this is the only decent place in town. Lola, I promise, I won't exchange a word with you that will create suspicion. I don't mind telling you I'm worried, but it is so good to see you. Oh, and, honey, as long as nobody can read my mind, it's not bad remembering those good old days. San Antonio. Ah! Hell's Half Acre! Oh! Yes, and Jess came looking for you at Fanny Porter's after they'd hijacked the Southern Pacific. Uh-huh. And he never took off those boots or his spurs. He ripped those fancy Fort Worth sheets all to hell and gone. All right. But not a hint in front of Rosa. She's the town blab. Right this way, Miss Dorrance. I'm sure you'll find the room satisfactory. Rosa-- Miss Dorrance will be staying. Come on. Better watch your step, honey. That place there is tricky. -Good morning, Mr. Siringo. -Good morning, Sheriff. -Hot enough for you? -I've seen hotter. -Your boys on duty? -Why, sure. When I tell them Mr. Siringo wants a prisoner watched, they watch. You got a magic name, Mr. Siringo. It comes with the job, I guess. Yeah. We ought to have a drink one night. I'd like to know how you did it. Ha ha. Uh, Charlie Siringo. Hello. Charlie Siringo. When did she get back to the States? Did she come to see you right away? Who? Etta Place. I told you I don't know any Etta Place. If it wasn't her, why'd she run off? Look, I hired a girl named Martin, Annie Martin. You never saw her before. No. When she said her name was Martin, you believed her. Well, why wouldn't I? You're a liar, Mister. You have to prove that. Don't think I won't, Mr. Baker. Name's Riley. The name's Baker, David Baker. You're wanted for bank robbery in Silver City, New Mexico. Nine years ago, you were an early member of the Wild Bunch and knew Etta Place. She was Sundance's woman. You knew her back then, and you knew her when she walked into your store. I never could understand you people. Do you think because you put it all behind you, walked righteous for nine years, it's all forgotten? A law broken is a debt owed. Of course, the size of the debt depends on how much help you give me. What do you mean? Give me Etta Place. I can't do that. You're facing a lot of years in Yuma Prison, Mr. Baker. Look, make sense, will you? If that woman is Etta Place, she's got to be long gone across the border by now. Maybe. Well, Mexico or the other side of the world, I'm going to catch her. Depend on it. Siringo. You know, that little girl that worked in my store-- just a little bit of a thing, pretty... now, what pleasure can you get from putting a woman like that in prison? Well, Mr. Siringo, are you satisfied with our guarding? That old boy won't get away. Well, I just want to make sure nobody takes him. Oh, we haven't lost one yet. There's always a first time, Sheriff. Oh, have some corn. I'm starved. Watch it. It's hot. [chatter] -[bell rings] -Evening, folks. Good evening. I'd like for you to meet our newest boarder, Miss Bonnie Dorrance of Philadelphia. Miss Dorrance, won't you have a seat right over here? -Rosa! -What? Well, Miss Dorrance, I'm Elsie Powell. Oh, I was married, but he died. Now tell me, what brings you all the way out here? My physician suggested a change of climate. Oh, finest climate in the world right here. What's your profession? I don't really have one. Nonsense. It's a new world. Women should have professions and the vote. Now, a nice little girl like you must know how to do something. I did some nursing once. That's it. You could be a nurse. Honorable profession. Oh, there's the chicken. And you don't have to see the doctor all the time unless he's good-looking and single. Now, Miss Powell, don't you start running Bonnie's life. Of course I will. I'm ready to introduce her to every eligible male in Nogales. Although the good Lord knows there aren't many of them. Now, you come with me tomorrow, and I'll show you around. Well, I-- I don't know. Well, what don't you know, dear? You got to see the town, don't you? I suppose so. Well, due to the delicate condition of your health, maybe you shouldn't be out very much. On the other hand, I should see the town and everything in it, don't you agree? Absolutely. [bell rings] Rosa! What? -More bread. -Ohh! Come on now. Giddy up! Giddy up! Giddy up! Oh, there she goes. Ha ha ha ha ha! You know, I haven't had it long. How long? Only two weeks. Two weeks? Yes, and I don't understand all these little, uh, gadgets. Ha ha ha ha! How long do you think it'll take you to learn? Well, I don't know. Soon, I hope. Oh, I hope so. Oh. Oh, dear, it stalled on me. Oh, you, there. I'll need some cranking. Mr. Siringo, I need a crank. The exercise will do you good. One or two good turns should do it. Well, hurry, please. I don't know what's the matter. You have to really give it a good turn. It usually starts right up. Oh, dear, give it a good turn. That's right. That's right. You're doing just fine. One more should do it. Good. -Oh! -Oh! Here we go! Ha ha! Thank you! Thank you very much! Ha ha ha ha! -Now on we go! -Oh, my God. Ooh! -Just clearing the engine. -I see. Do you know who that was? Charlie Siringo, the famous detective. I'll never understand what kind of man goes around hunting other people. Foolish ones. A modern version of the hired gun. Those two men with him are officers in the Mexican Army. What's he doing with them? Well, there's a train here loaded with guns for President Diaz. I didn't know he was mixed up in their politics. He couldn't care less who wins. He's been hired to see that those arms get through Villa's territory safely. Personally, I'm on Pancho's side. Good-looking man. [car approaching] Well, here we are back at Lola's. -Hello, there. -Hi, Miss Powell. Thank you, Mrs. Powell, so much. -It was very lovely. -It was lovely. -Bye-bye. -Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Ah, giddy up! Giddy up! -How was it? -It was wonderful. It's quite a machine. Hmm. Come on, sit down, sit down. Let's have some sherry. What took you so long? Was Mrs. Powell prying into your private business? No. Oh, well, where'd you go? What did you do? I met Siringo. You what? Don't worry. He didn't recognize me. Are you sure? Would I be here if he did? I guess not. Siringo's a smart man. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. He's a good-looking man, too, you know? It's too bad he's in that line of work. Would you set your cap for him if he wasn't? I might. No, you wouldn't. Oh, sometimes I think I might just set my cap for anybody. I've been alone too long. I keep telling myself I'll get used to it, but-- [sigh]-- there's nights when that bed upstairs gets to be four times its size. And what about you? What about me? Living alone, no man to hold you on lonely nights. I had a man. So did I, but they're gone now, and we're here, and if you've got some magic way of putting aside your womanliness, I wish you'd let me know. No magic way. [sigh] Sometimes I dream... and he's there with me... with his arms around me and holding me tight... holding me very tight. Oh. If you don't quit talking like that, I'm going to run out and lasso me the first man I see. With my luck, he'll be the town bum. Come on, honey. I'll get a nice cool bath ready for you. That sounds good. I think I could use one of those myself. Wait till Siringo sees you, Bone, the most beautiful horse he'll ever see. And when he comes out here, I want you to be at attention, looking sharp and neat. Remember, do anything he says because that's Charlie Siringo. Hello, Alvin. Oh, Lola. Sheriff, you're getting skinnier every time I see you. That's true. I'm wasting away just pining over you. Come on back to me, Lola. Well, if you weren't such a pig-headed man about women's suffrage, I just might think about it. Me? I see you sniggering into your beer every time the suffragettes have a rally. Oh, not me. I think you have a perfect right to vote, as long as it's not in any election. The first thing I'd do it vote you right out of office. You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you? Not if you'll just sign my petition. You can sign your name, can't you? Only thing that got me elected. Anybody that can spell Laupenheimer I guess can keep his job. I appreciate it. Well, there you go again. That's all I get is "appreciate." "I appreciate it." I thought maybe after I'm off duty, you and I could go out in the cool night air. Now, you know it takes more than one signature to spend that kind of time with me. [laughing] What about the boys inside? Think you can get them to sign? No, no. Nobody else is allowed in there. Aww. Alvie, it's only me. Have your beautiful body follow my beautiful body. Hey, boys, look what I brought you. Hey, Lola! It's about time you did something worthwhile, Sheriff. Lola, you're looking better every day. You ought to stay here and let us guard. -I'll buy that. -Hey, right, Tiny? I think that's a fine idea. Come on, Tiny, you sign right here, -right under Alvin. -Okay. You're next, Stretch. SIRINGO: They're on duty, ma'am. I beg your pardon? They don't sign, and they don't talk. But I only wanted his signature on this petition. I'm not interested in what you want, ma'am. Nobody's allowed in here but us. I thought I made that clear. Mrs. Wilkins is a personal friend of mine. I'm sure. I still want no exceptions. I'm sorry, ma'am. You'll have to leave. Hmm. Two men? Two of the biggest men I ever saw. And Siringo's probably got more. There's no way to get him out, Etta. There must be. Oh, give it up, honey. Lord knows just coming into town the way you did, nobody can say you didn't try. When are you going to start thinking of yourself? We could find you a town. You can make a new start. I've thought of that. Well, then do it. It's too bad I don't have any relatives that haven't disowned me. I can't do that, Lola. I wouldn't be able to sleep nights. Now stop pushing on me. All right, then do whatever you want. But that's the last time I'm helping you. All right. What can we do? Where did you say Ben Lant was? [howling] You have no business here, señorita. Now turn your horse and go back. I need to see Ben Lant. No gringos are allowed in here. Adiós. I'm a friend of Ben's. He'll see me. He wouldn't be pleased with my treatment. If the gringo does not know, you, señorita, you will be dead... or wish you were. Go right ahead. Vámos,José. [shouting in Spanish] Gringo! Gringo? Whoa! A lady to see you! You son of a-- [laughing] Etta! Etta Place! Lord, it's good to see you, darling. I thought you were dead or something. Ha ha ha! Ha! Ohh! Ben. Ben. Let me look at you. You haven't changed a bit, have you? Ha ha ha! Hey, Ben, ¿la conóces? Sí, sí! Perdón, señorita. Está bien. Ben. Ha. I need some help, Ben. Ah, we all do, darling. The old days are over and done with, though. I don't have any money, love, or I'd give you some. I'm not looking for a stake. I want you and some friends to help me get Dave Baker out of jail. -Old Dave Baker? -Yes. I thought he was dead, too. How big a job is this? Siringo's got him. Siringo? Now, that might take an army, love. Or a few well-armed men. Hey, they are Pancho's men, love. I'm just a rider here. Can't we borrow them? Ha ha ha! You don't know old Pancho. This lad's thinking of starting a revolution. He's not just hanging around here trying to pick up some easy money. Can't you ask him? I don't think I have the courage to do that, love. Oh, he can't be as fearsome as all that. Why don't you just sit here and relax, darling? And then, when he gets back here, you can decide that for yourself. Come on, have some more coffee and tell me how you got out of Bolivia-- -Ben-- -...and what happened to you-- Ben, Ben, I don't have the time. Come on, you've got to take me to him. I'll do all the talking. Ah, you haven't changed a bit. Yes, you pray to God, huh? And you thank Him for all the benefits that you now enjoy. But I remember that we welcomed you as a friend from the north and we made you one of us. Hmm? You have become rich and comfortable, and you have lived in peace. Well, peace must be paid for, amigo. We must all contribute to the coming revolution. So you take this opportunity to ask forgiveness for your sins, for if you do not contribute, your widow will. - Pancho. - ¿Qué quiéres? Venga aquí. This gringa,she says she has business with you. I seem to spend this whole day with nortes. Or perhaps you have money to give me. No, I want your help. My help? Well, I'm sorry, señora. You see, I'm busy helping my people. Get rid of her. Señor, wait. It's bad manners to shoot in a church. Fiero, get rid of this woman! Pancho, she's a friend of mine. La mujer delSundance Kid. Encantado. Mucho gusto. Perdóname. My apologies, señora. I thought that you were-- Just another woman seeking to please you. It has been known to happen. Fiero will make you comfortable while I accept a contribution from my devout friend. I haven't much time. Fiero, you give him one more chance to contribute the money. If he refuses, shoot him. But not in church. Señora. [clucking] Muchas gracias, viejos. Vaya con Diós. There's Pancho Villa, muchacho. That is el jefe. [speaking Spanish] Jefe. [speaking Spanish] -Diaz? -Sí, jefe. [speaking Spanish] -¿Tódos muertos? -Sí. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] Vá, muchacho. He's very young. Yes, señora, he's very young, and his whole family has just been killed. Should I send him to an orphanage? What do you suggest, señora? -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry, too. Forgive me. Sorry. What can I do for you, señora? I need some help. What kind of help? I need to break a friend out of jail. Why should I help you do this? Because Ben Lant is your friend. Because I was Sundance's woman. Because I thought there would be some respect-- -[chuckling] -...for one thing, to his memory. Señora, please. He was a bandido,no? I am not a bandido, señora. We are starting a revolution. See, my army waits for me, waits to be called in a thousand villages. You see, there is a difference, señora. I am not a bandido. I am not a bandido,señora. You have had a long, long ride. You need rest, maybe some food and some wine. We will sit and talk, and I will tell you about my revolution. Perhaps you can forget about your troubles and think about the sweet choice of life. Think about the sweeter things. All I need are five good men plus Ben Lant for one day, two days. Señora, I admire your good intentions, and I-- and I'm sure that it is a worthy cause, but there is nothing in it for me to gain. What if there were? Then I would think about it. Favor for favor? Perhaps. All right. Favor for favor. Can you use arms and ammunition? Of course. One does not fight a revolution with kisses. If I could get guns and ammunition for you, would you help me then? Hmm. And where would you get these? There's a carload of them in Nogales, waiting to be shipped to Diaz. So I have heard. We are waiting for the train to cross the border. When it does, we will blow it up, and then boom. No more guns for Diaz. Señor Villa, I'm talking serious business. I'm not one of your camp followers. Of course. Serious business, señora. But you do not find me attractive, huh? I am told I am. Yes. Very attractive. Why don't we first become good friends and then talk about serious business later, huh? Hmm? Perhaps one day we will be friends. If that day comes, it will be my idea, not yours. It will be because I want to and not because you have nothing better to do in the afternoon. Now do we talk or not? We talk. Maybe you don't have to blow up the train. Maybe you can get the guns for yourself. And perhaps you can tell me how we can take a fast-moving, well-armed train. The way Butch and Sundance did in Bolivia. They put their own people on the train. Impossible, señora. -There's a chance. -You are dreaming, señora. First you have to know the time of departure, the route of the train. You're talking-- You're dreaming, señora. Impossible. But if I could get that information for you, would you help me then? If you can get that information for me, then we have something to talk about. All right, I'll get it. And we'll have a bargain. I don't understand it. I'm told I'm irresistible to women. You are. [click] [lock latches] [door closes] -Are you all right? -I'm fine. Honest to Pete, I could wring your neck. You worried me half out of my mind. It's all right. I got what I needed. Well, whatever fool thing that was-- [gasp] Someone's coming. Now you stay right there. -[door closes] -Rosa. What are you doing coming in so late? Oh, sorry, Miss Wilkins. I was just talking to my friend. Where are you going? To get my tatting. I left it in the parlor. Well, you can tat tomorrow. It's awfully late. -Get up to bed. -Can't I get my tatting-- -Have you been drinking? -No, ma'am. Don't you lie to me. I'm going to write a letter to your mama about you. 40 cases, 24 each, Winchester repeating rifles. 18 crates of .30 caliber machine guns, water cooled. -120-- -Read the bottom. "Consigned to Porfirio Diaz, President of Mexico." What good is this without times, dates, and places? I must know when and where they cross the border. I have that, and a map of the train route. Let me see that. After my friend is safely out of jail. I want Ben in Nogales tomorrow to go over the details. Dave's trial is almost over. If we're going to break him out, it has to be now. Miss Place. You're a very special woman. Surely, Ben, there is something for you to do. No. I don't have anything else to do. Yes, you do. Yeah, well, I'll just-- I'll just, uh, run on down and check on the horses and see how things are down below. This Sundance Kid. I have been asking many questions. He was-- He was quite a man, quite a macho,huh? You must try once again to find such a man. Now, I insist. For such a woman to be wasted, unthinkable. There's no rush. You rode with him, huh? Riding, shooting, stealing and robbing banks, even killing. This is true, huh? If you listen, you can hear anything. Ah-ah. No, you are not answering my question. What do you think? I think-- that I will keep you here with me tonight. Hmm? I must be back. What if I tell my men not to let you go? Then I would stay. But I don't think you would find much pleasure in spending the night with me and a memory. In certain Latin countries, if you are found alone in a room with a young woman of quality like yourself, there is only one thing to do. What's that? Marry her. [laughing] It's good to see you laugh. It's good to see you laugh, Etta. I have you to thank for it. I will look for Ben in Nogales tomorrow. Don't you see enough of me in the courtroom? I'll be rid of you soon enough. Jury's convinced you're guilty. You'll be sentenced soon. Why don't you make it easier on yourself? Told you before I can't do that. Out of loyalty, friendship? For what, Dave? You've been abandoned. I thought your Etta Place would show up and try something. Not a sign. Well, maybe that ought to be a sign for you. If she doesn't know me, why would she try to help me? Well, you're alone. Everybody's left you, even your wife. What's that supposed to mean? That's right. She's gone. I don't believe you. You'd better. My man reported to me that he saw your wife take everything and go off to California. Why take it alone, man? Why don't you cooperate with me so I can talk to the judge? Let me help you. Oh, I know you're just dying to help me, Charlie. You know, I think that's your trouble. You're just too soft-hearted. Well, whether you believe it or not, -I am. -Mm-hmm-hnm. Well, your wife harbored Etta Place, too. I did you a favor. I didn't arrest her. Of course, now that she's left you, maybe you wish that I had. At least you'd know where she is for a couple of years. This plan of yours better work, darling. It will. Mattie get off all right? Ah, she got away fine. I only hope the rest of the plan works as well. Not like walking into a bank and saying "Stick 'em up," is it? No, darling. Those moves were simple. I'm not dealing with a simple man, Ben. Siringo is smart. Mm-hmm. Tell me something I don't know, love, for I'd be overjoyed to hear it. It looks clear outside. You'd better get going. I know. Lots of things to do, and Villa's people got to get ready. We could use another day, Etta. It has to be tomorrow. He'll be sentenced fast and moved to Yuma. -Watch yourself, Ben. -Ah, you know me, darling. You just be ready when we ride into town and hit that courthouse. -Bye, Lola. -Good luck, Ben. Look after yourself, darling. It hasn't been that bad since we got rid of the border bandits. They used to come up here and raise hell now and then. Mm-hmm. Even old Diaz. We got so tough with him that... staying home, and made this town a... nice place for a lawman. I have even gotten married. That can be hard on a lawman. You mean women being afraid of you getting killed? No. Them making you afraid. I had a friend. I knew a man one time who nearly got wrecked like that. By getting married? The same thing. A woman had got inside him. Drunk card man came after him. The woman was there. She caught a stray bullet. She die? Yeah. Nobody else ever got that close to him again. What does, uh, your friend do for companionship? [chuckle] In most towns, Sheriff, there are ladies where you know the price ahead of time. But can she cook? You know, I got to admit, I have second thoughts about having a wife. I'm a sucker for a pretty face. Just like that new girl staying over at Lola Wilkins'. [chuckle] New girl? How long has she been here? Mm, maybe a week. Elsie Powell says she's a nurse. Well, she can nurse me any time she wants. [laughing] You say she's pretty? Are you interested? I'm sorry you're not going with us. Oh, so am I, in a way. Life before you got here was safe, but oh, so quiet. It's a good life, though, isn't it? You're really somebody now. Might even get married. Ha! Me? I doubt it. Anyway, there's nobody around here that's really caught my eye, not after somebody like Jess back in the old days. Oh, I know. Think we'll ever see each other again? You sure you got enough clothes and things? I have everything I need. Etta. I want you to have this. Oh, I-- I can't. Oh, no, no, go ahead and take it. Take it. It's for your hands. Keeps them from getting too rough. Damn, I'm going to miss you. Now you be careful, honey, and you give Dave my love. And, oh, just be careful, huh? I will. [knock on door] Miss Dorrance, I'm Charles Siringo. I've got a problem. I need your help. -Maybe I can help. -Mrs. Powell claims that you know something about nursing. Well, I've got a prisoner who's sick, and I don't know if it's catching or not. I've pulled him away from the rest of my people. Canceled his trial for the day. Would you take a look at him for me? I'm no doctor, Mr. Siringo. Well, the doctor's out somewhere delivering a baby. I'd appreciate it, Miss, please. Well, I don't know how much I can do. Well, whatever you can do, I'll be most grateful. I'm Nurse Dorrance. Just relax, and I'll see if I can make you more comfortable. May I have a basin of water, please? Get it for her, deputy. And some towels, too, please. Stand out. Well? I couldn't be sure. Maybe we made him too sick to show surprise. Charlie, if you made a mistake-- I didn't make a mistake. They made me drink something last night. I've been sick ever since. What are you doing here? It's Villa! He's after my train! -What about the-- -Lock them up! Stay down, ma'am. I don't want you being shot. Lola, what the hell are you doing here? And what's that thing on your lip? They're not in the courthouse. -They're in the jail. -Both of them? Both of them. Get yourself out of here before you get hurt. You really like it? Oh, I love it. Give us a kiss. Ride! Get out of here! Oof! [honk honk] Let me out of here! Look there. Trust you to get yourself arrested at the wrong time, darling. Hang on, and we'll have you out of there in a minute. Thank you, love. My pleasure, darling. Let's get out of here now. I thought they were after the train. So did I till I saw riders take some shots at the courthouse. -Sheriff. -Courthouse? That's where Dave Baker was supposed to be. Mr. Siringo, Dave Baker and some woman riding fast that way right past me. -Are you sure? -Yes, sir. Got off a couple of shots. -Did you hit them? -No, sir. They was riding too fast. Let's go, Sheriff. Bring your men! Hey, Sheriff, your jail's broke. Wagon tracks, heading south towards the border. Hey, wait a second. You can't go there. That's Villa country. I've got friends down there. That's Villa country! [groaning] Oh. Yahoo! [laughs] Hallelujah, I'm free. I'm out of that jail away from that man. You're feeling a lot better, aren't you? Where's Mattie? With friends. I knew that man was lying to me. He doesn't know me, and he doesn't know Mattie. We're gonna go to California, honey, the three of us. I think I'll stay here a while. Honey, you'd love California. I think I'll stay. I'm not thinking, am I? Pancho Villa doesn't help you for free. What's it costing you? Nothing. Honey, from what I know of that man's reputation with women, I find that hard to believe. So does he. MAN: We are here. The cave is up there. You will hide and wait. Be careful. There are ruraleseverywhere. - Muchas gracias. - Go on, go on. Muchas gracias,buddy. [groans] No, it's okay. It's okay. You all right? Yeah. How about you? Oh, a little stiff. I can't wait to see Mattie. She's fine. Is she, Etta? How does she look? She's in good hands and waiting for you. Ah. [chuckles] Oh, best old girl in the west. Present company excepted, of course. Of course. [horse neighing] Well. You gave me a good run, Miss Place. And now it's over. On your feet. Ahh. Ohh. I believe Mr. Riley is too sick to travel, Mr. Siringo. Get up there. Get up, I'll put a hole through you right now if I have to. Now, wait a minute. Now, don't get me wrong, Charlie. It's not that I'm not patriotic. You know, I'd just as soon die here in Mexico as rot in prison in the states. Kinda pleasant here with Etta. Played a good thing, didn't you. Two women. No wonder your wife got fed up and ran off. Doesn't he have a beautiful mind, though? Mattie wasn't jealous, Mr. Siringo. Are you? Are you sure you're not jealous? The only thing appealing about you is a vision of you in prison. [chuckles] You won't be so pretty after a while. Oh? You think I'm pretty? You really think I'm pretty, Charlie? Either you get up or I'm gonna have the ruralescome in here, and carry you out, tie you to a supply burro. All right. Jose! Vamanos! -Come on. -I'm sorry, Señor Siringo, but Jose has been detained with a very large headache. Oh, excuse me, Señor Siringo, el SeñorPancho Villa. Mucho gusto. How do ya do? We were so afraid you'd lost the trail. But you're here. Here for what? You'll find out soon enough. Just take pleasure in being needed. One move and she dies. Then you will die also, Mr. Siringo, but so slowly that you will beg for death. For you will have killed my friend and new business partner. And you will force me to make an example. Of course, to die for such a woman will not be so bad. [guns cocking] -Muchas gracias. -De nada, chula. Pancho. Pancho. [speaks Spanish] Que pasa? The Diaz troops. They've taken Las Madridas. When? Two days ago. We just got word. They've burned it, as an example to discourage future followers. Ay dios, pero... Were many hurt? Enough. All right. You tell the people not to resist. All right? Tell them-- [sighs] Tell them I don't want any more bloodshed. Ah? We will, uh-- We will have to rebuild when we can, and as soon as Diaz's troops move out, we will send them more food and supplies. We've barely got enough for ourselves. We will share what we have! Go. Tell the people not to despair. All right, I'll tell them. Hah! Hah! Mattie! Mattie! Dave! [laughing] I knew you wouldn't leave me. -I knew it. -Davey, I had to say it, otherwise, I couldn't get away. Are you all right? Oh, yeah. I'm fine now, honey. Well, you look awful. Oh, yeah. [laughing] I love you! That's really what it was all about. What do you get out of it? The look on their faces. You still don't understand, do you? He didn't say anything. Today, tomorrow, I don't know. He just went right across the border. It seems to me you've got enough guards to get you through all right, major. Well, Siringo or no, these guns must be delivered on schedule. Muchas gracias, sheriff. [speaking Spanish] MAN: Pancho, la comida, mi hermano. -Gracias, amigo. -Come, come. [laughter] DAVE: They had me so sick. Wait'll you see, Mattie, when we get to California. Good-looking woman. Your wife as well. [chuckles] Not as well as that. I think you like her. I think you're right. She disturbs you. Hmm? No. No, hombre. No, que... Sí. Why? Because... I don't know. All women are the same. You want her, take her. Oh, no, not this one. This-- this one is-- is different. She's not like other women. Pancho, a man like you should have whatever he wants. [chuckles] You would give me the whole world if it were possible, huh? The whole world is too big. Maybe half, huh? Ah, better go and take a look at the train. Take Ben with you. I don't need Ben, hombre. -Are you a hero? -No, I'm not a hero. Then take Ben! [laughing] [speaks Spanish] [humming] Great Mr. Siringo. You know, Diaz does me a great honor by hiring you. Does he pay you much money? He's very much afraid of me, no? He's not afraid, Villa. "Viy-ya." He just takes precautions. Oh. [laughs] Precautions, huh? A train, federales, machine guns. And the great Mr. Siringo. No. He's afraid. Why should he be afraid of a cheap border bandido? Revolutionary. [chuckles] Maybe you can fool the people, Mr. Villa, but you started out as a cheap bandido, and you'll always be one. The people and me, we love each other, Mr. Siringo. Well, the people have short memories. You used to steal from them. Well, a man has to make his money somehow. But at least I never sold my services to the highest bidder. See, we have a name for that, Mr. Siringo. You wanna know what that name is? [spitting] Man to man. Francisco, no! We are gonna take your train, and the guns. And if we do, you live. But if we fail, you die. And I'm personally going to send your head to Diaz. You always go around tempting fate? When the stakes are high enough. Same as you. I'd almost take that as a compliment. You all right? You better eat something. What's the matter? Didn't you expect to be fed? I didn't know what to expect from you. That's because to you, we're just something to be caught and put away. I can make a deal for you, Etta. A few years in prison, maybe. But at least no rope. Now, you get us out of here, and I'll do my part. Seems to me your part is tracking people down, and hanging them or shooting them on the spot. If you're talkin' about Butch and Sundance, that was Joel Forest that followed you down to Bolivia. Aren't you all one and the same? He had to die sooner or later, Etta. Later would have been better. ETTA: Are you all right? I'm all right. Are you all right? Oh, I'm tired. And thinking about the train. Now, you let me do the thinking about the train. But we must do something about your tiredness. Hmm? We must do something for your rest. After you, mi vida. [speaks Spanish] [guitar playing] You can rest here inside my tent. And you? Well, I was hoping that... I would be invited. [guitar continues] You're still the sad widow. I could help you forget. Perhaps I'm not ready to forget. You won't even try. Huh? All right, do me a favor, please. Do not mention this rejection to my men, because I have a reputation to uphold. Uh-- [clears throat] Uh, there's something for you under the pillow. I don't know how it got there or-- Just-- Under the pillow. If we succeed with the train tomorrow, you, Etta Place, will have helped arm the revolution. Every machine gun, every rifle, even the bullets will remind us of you. So you must have something to remind you of us. Open it. Open it, open it, open it. You like it? It's very handsome. Well, try it on, try it on. Here, let me help you. [clears throat] Let me help you. No, no, no, I did not steal this. My uncle is an Indian silversmith, and he made it just for you. No, I promise. I promise. No, this is not stolen, this is brand new. -I know. -Oh, Francisco, thank you. I'm sorry, Francisco. When I am dead, will such a woman grieve for me in such a way? Rest well. Eh, querida. [howling] [horses approaching] Federales. That damn train's like a battleship on wheels. We were scouting it from more than 100 yards away, and Fierro tried to get a little closer. Fierro. Fierro. I am godfather to his son. They will all die. We will blow them up, every one of them, Fierro. We start with Siringo. I send his head to Diaz, and then we dynamite the train. You hear me? But don't you want the guns? I want dead federales. Francisco. I understand your pain. But you need the guns. Don't you care about your revolution? I care that Fierro is avenged. Where are you going? If you don't want the guns, then you don't need us anymore. Your friends can go. I need you here. I can't stay. I say you will. You can't do that. I can do as I please. We had a bargain. I kept my half. Then let me keep mine. We can get the guns. There will be no guns. There will be guns if I have to do it myself. All right, all right. All right, you do it yourself. You keep your half of the bargain, you get the guns by yourself. Not exactly by herself. You're out of it now, Dave. You and Mattie are all right. I promised that. Etta, I'm not gonna let you do this alone. It's too risky. That's what I think, too. If you don't mind, uh, we'll take Mr. Siringo here with us. No! This man dies. Because you need to smell blood? All right, this man dies, I say! Francisco, you're being stupid and childish. All right, gringa, all right, gringa! All right. But understand this. If you fail, I cannot let those guns reach Diaz. I must blow up the train. And you with it. On, that-- you have my word. And you, my friend, you owe your life to her. Strike the camp! [speaks Spanish] You all right? I don't know. Hey. You know, uh, if you don't want to do this, now's the time to say so. It should work. Butch and Sundance did it. Didn't they? What do you mean, didn't they? You're the one that told me about it. The what was all that stuff about, "Oh, it'll be fun. There's nothin' to it"? -What was all that? -Calm down, Dave. Well, all right, but if you don't want to do it, we don't have to do it. -You know, we can leave-- -It'll work! DAVE: Never mind, it's too late now. We have to do it. Here they are. Here he is, folks. I don't have to tell you to watch him close. All right, hold it a minute, Ben. Etta. All set. Well, Charlie, have you ever robbed a train before? Oh, don't worry about it, it's gonna be fun. There's nothin' to it. Ben, how long ago did Pancho's men leave with that dynamite? Oh, quite a while ago. They should be digging in now. This plan of yours better work. If you haven't stopped the train by the time it reaches the trestle, it blows. They were Pancho's orders. Etta or no. [makes explosion sound] Goodbye, darlin'. -So long, Ben. -Goodbye, Ben. [wind whistling] [engine chugging] [bell ringing] [train whistle blows] This is the most important speech you'll ever make, Mr. Siringo. Get it right. -You all right? -I'm okay. -[engine chugging] -[bell ringing] [train whistle blowing] [steam hissing] Major! Major Vasquez! Ah, Señor Siringo. Buenos días, Major. Buenos días. I was told you would not be riding with us. My plans were changed. This is Señor and Señora Tate. Mucho gusto. But you're hurt, señor. Oh, yeah. My ranch was attacked by Pancho Villa's bandidos. Pancho Villa? Where was this? We have a small ranch near Santa Ynez. They raided us and ran off our horses. Mr. Siringo happened to be visiting us. Ahh. This man is seriously ill, major. I think he ought to have medical attention as soon as possible. But Señor Siringo, your own orders forbid passengers. Well, I changed my orders to accommodate Mr. and Mrs. Tate. He insisted we come along. A very compassionate man. Very well. This way, please. Follow me. VASQUEZ: Vamanos! [train whistle blows] [hissing] [bell ringing] [engine chugging] Here, Dave, let me help you. No, uh, Charlie. I feel a lot better now. [train whistle blowing] [gunshot] [engine chugging] Well, it's a good thing, major, that you never let down on your work. I would like to know, Señor Tate, why you said that Pancho Villa attacks your ranch, yet makes no attempt to attack this train. Well, look at all your, uh, your soldiers out there. He'd have to be a fool. Ah, but he's a fool, señor. And reckless. According to you, he's in this general area. Yet we see not a sign. What do you think, Señor Siringo? Is this not a bit strange? Now, give him a chance, major. I think your federales will get a good work out yet. You know, you never told me why you did not leave Nogales with us, señor. I must admit to a certain confusion. They were undoubtedly Villa's gang that attacked the town. Yet they never came near the train. Well, major-- They were not well-armed enough to bother you, major. Just a defenseless rancherialike ours. You not then leave after Etta Place and your escaped prisoner? A tall man, and a beautiful woman. You're a very intelligent man, Major Vasquez. Too intelligent to die, I think. Are you going to prove me wrong? I would never argue with a beautiful woman, señora. Give me the gun. Good. Just sit. And enjoy the view. -[engine chugging] -[whistle blowing] [whistle blowing] It's time. Major, send your man for your medical bag. Sargento! [speaking Spanish] [laughs] Very good, major. You put on a good act. Now I have to ask you to leave the room. Get your gun, major! [gasping] [punch landing] Come on, Dave. DAVE: My goodness, you do good work. I haven't had this much fun in years. ETTA: Come on! [straining] It's stuck! We've gotta do it now, Dave. Are you watching him? Yes. [gunshot] [gunshots] VASQUEZ: Open the door! Mr. Siringo, open up! [banging] [straining] [banging continues] [gun cocking] [yelling] [yelling in Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [gunshots] [yelling in Spanish] [gunshots] [yelling in Spanish] They're getting away! Rapido, rapido! We did it! We did it! Just like the old days. Yeah, just like the old days. I knew it. This doesn't seem to be grabbing. No, it doesn't. This thing doesn't seem to be grabbing. That's what I said. [metal scraping] Did this happen to Butch and Sundance on that train in Bolivia? -No. -Well, what would they have done? Panicked, same as us. [speaking Spanish] [metal scraping] Etta, these brakes just aren't gonna hold. We're gonna have to jump. I can't. I'm scared. Here they come! And there they go. Vamanos, muchachos. This thing's got to slow down some time. Oh, no, Dave, look! Oh, my Lord, if we hit that thing we'll blow up. Well, stop talking and pull this damn thing. [metal scraping] Ohhh! Stop! Stop! [yelling in Spanish] And you better have a good explanation for my superiors. [speaking Spanish] [metal scraping] Are we still alive? I think so. [laughs] -We did it. -Yahoo! -Yeah! -We did it! [speaks Spanish] DAVE: Yes, we did it, Pancho! Where's my wife? [indistinct chatter] Bring the horses! Bring the horses. [speaking Spanish] [yelling in Spanish] Now I need to get me a horse. And what the hell do you need a horse for? [speaking Spanish] There's a woman I want. MAN 1: Go on, get those guns out of there. MAN 2: Get those big boxes and put them over there. MAN 1: Arriba! Arriba! Amigos. Another time, we would have a big celebration, but not today. Your saddle bags are full of supplies, food and water, and very soon the federalescome. So I suggest you ride very hard for the border. California, Arizona-- California, that's the place. I always wanted to go there. We'll change our names, we'll have-- We'll start a whole new life. You comin', Etta? I'll ride with you part way. Don't you like California? Yes, uh, but I'm not taking the chance of messing up your life a second time. Messing up my life? I never had so much fun. You're comin' with us. Come on, Mattie. I'm a little sorry to leave. No. Unfinished business. Perhaps someday. Que viva, Pancho Villa. Que viva, Etta Place. Rico somos que tienen amigos. DAVE: Ben, give my love to the federales. BEN: I'll do that, lad. Ah, look after him, Mattie. -Goodbye, darlin'. -Goodbye, Ben. -Take care. -You, too. All right, love. What did she say to you? Those who have friends are rich. ♪♪♪
