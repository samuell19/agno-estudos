My grandmother's. Right. So you do your grandmother's laundry? That's pretty sweet. Well, normally she does the laundry. So, not so sweet? You live with your grandmother? Yeah. I take care of her. ...but what makes it beautiful, it's the, it's the spirit of God in your life at work. I'm not just... I'm not judging you, I'm just telling you the truth. All that happy days when Jesus came into my life. That's akin to what we were just singing about, isn't it? When Jesus starts... And here was the most thrilling thing that ever happened to me, was when Jesus reached out and washed my sins away. And rolled that heavy burden away and I was free! - Hallelujah. - Free from the burden of sin, free from condemnation, do you know that experience? Mm-hmm? "For my love, "to protect your heart until I see you again." "If we are ever reunited, return the coin to me." "Dear Marie, I've uncovered evidence that my son, Dominic, "did not die from complications after he was born. "I'm convinced now that my son is alive. "I could always feel his living spirit, but now I have proof. "If you can find it in your heart, please, "tell him that I also continue to live "and that I long to see him. "I'm not asking to see him again in the near future, "but I do hope with all my heart "that when he's a young man, he will seek me out. "Please, show these letters to Dominic "when you think he's old enough to understand. Please don't punish him for my transgressions." Uh-huh. Can I help you with something? I was just curious about your order. But surely you know that curiosity killed the cat. Well, I can't help it. I'm inquisitive by nature. Is that right? Well, if you know what an order is, you should know that these boys here are sequestered. I entreat you not to engage with them. If you know what an order is, you should know that these boys are sequestered. Surely you know that curiosity killed the cat. I entreat you not to engage with them. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jesus. - Who the fuck are you? - Whoa, hey! - What do you want? I'm looking for Beatrice Beauchamp. She's not here. When will she be back? I haven't the slightest notion. Look, I don't mind waiting for her outside, but I do intend to speak with her. Suit yourself, but she might not be back for hours. I've got nothing but time. Yeah, that's more than obvious. Don't disturb anything. Who...? What is he...? What does he think he's doing? You have some fucking nerve. The water is a little cold, but it s not bad. Come out of there and put your clothes back on. If you insist. What do you think you're doing? That was great. I feel reborn. Stay back. Could you put it away, please? You wouldn't want it to go off by accident. Wouldn't I? I said stay back. - I'm warning you! - Why don't you...? Why don't you just give me the... Irene, get away from him. Stop. I said stop! Mother? That's right. I almost forgot. Why did she keep these from me? She was headstrong. Like her grandson. How do you know I am? You found me, didn't you? But... it looks like she took good care of you. I'm thankful for that. Do you have any papers? A birth certificate? Irene, there's no need for that. Aren't the letters proof enough? Are they? How do we know how he got them. I think I know my own son. Anyway, I guess you do clean up pretty good. Except for that scruff on your face. What's wrong with it? You look like a redneck. Wow, coming from someone who's been living in the woods her whole life. I haven't lived here my whole life. Why don't we have a toast? To mother and child reunion. To mother and child reunion. So, how long have you been living here, Irene? I don't think we need to get into that right now. Yes, it's quite an epic story. I'm sure you'll be enchanted. God, I really hope she's not my sister. I'm not sure it's a sister you're after. I think we could all use a rest. Dominic? You must be exhausted from your trip. I didn't mean to upset you. You're not upsetting me in the least. Maybe I should stay in the village tonight. Don't be silly. You're home now and this time... I won't let go of you. Okay. My birth? Yes, I started out as an artist. Mostly painting and drawing. It's still a big part of my life, but I believe my true calling lies elsewhere. Really? Mm-hmm. Art is merely an imitation of nature. I've become much more interested in nature itself and its transformative healing powers. Its mystical properties. After losing you, it was the only thing that gave me hope. I even tried to summon you. Wow. So you are a witch. A witch? Who told you that? Some silly waitress at the village. What else did she say? She said that you live with a girl who never grows old. Ha. I'm surprised they haven't tried to burn us at the stake. There are so many things I want to ask you. Go to tell Irene you'll be staying with us for a while. She won't like it. She's like a child sometimes. Whose child? All in good time. You should rest now. If you want supper around here, you have to kill it yourself. Come with me. Do you stalk your dinner every day? Keep your voice down. Beatrice and I live entirely off the land, try to avoid the villagers as much as possible. How come? Haven't you read Frankenstein? So how long have you lived with Beatrice? I said keep your voice down, you'll scare them off. Hey! Are you my sister or not? I said be quiet. What... What... Come on, what are you doing? Maybe we should have you for dinner. That's not funny. Just like a man... the joke's only funny when it's not at his expense. Irene, I don't want to get off on the wrong foot with you. I think it's a little late for that. Hey! I want you to be okay with me being here. You can't just show up and change everything around. Beatrice and I have our ways. That's not what I'm trying to do. Your hair. Your eyes. Your... nose. Your mouth. Your face. What about my face? You look nothing like her. I am her son. Why is it so hard to tell me who you are? Maybe you'll find out at dinner. Well? What are you waiting for? Where should I begin? With Agathe. Yes, of course. Always with Agathe. Are you hurt? It's all right, I'm just pregnant. What a lovely baby! She likes you. She doesn't usually take to strangers. We were careless. Your father found out. He didn't let on that he knew about us, not until the night you were born. It was like a nightmare. You were a month premature. There were complications. - They told me... - Oh, my God. ...that you were a stillborn. The father and Agathe's husband both filed for divorce, publicly shaming us as adulteresses. It was a terrible scandal. I was already convinced it was a conspiracy, but I had to be sure. So late one night, Agathe and I made a trip to the graveyard. The headstone with my name on it. But what about Agathe? "Love Eternal." Why didn't you come to see me after my father died? You have to understand, Agathe and I were excommunicated and exiled. Everyone despised us for what we did and for what we were. Your grandmother, the church, heh, the child authorities. There must have been something you could have done. None of them wanted you to have any contact with me. You could have pleaded with them. I only wrote those letters out of desperation. You could have tried harder. I did what I thought was best for you. Did you really? You left my father for a goddamn woman... That's enough. ...when you were pregnant with me? I said that's enough. I'm so sorry, Dominic. I did what I thought was best for you. They told me you were a stillborn. I was already convinced it was a conspiracy. Your father found out. It was a terrible scandal. Publicly shaming us as adulteresses. I only wrote those letters out of desperation. Every one despised us for what we did and for what we were. Your grandmother, the church, the child authorities, none of them wanted you to have any contact with me. You have to understand. You have to understand. I'm so sorry, Dominic. I'm so sorry, Dominic. What are you doing? He only takes pictures of himself. I mean, who does that? Nice, nice. Up! What do you got? - That was... - I don't know what that was. I don't know what that was. I don't know what that was. You still had a great hit though. - Daniel's gonna serve it? - All right. Ready, guys? Yeah, go! - Whoa. - What...? What the hell? Yo, what's your problem? That's fucked up, man. - Oh, come on. - It's all good. I wish you'd learn to knock. Sorry. How was the game? I hate sports. You need to keep fit. I'm 22. You need to keep fit. You're determined to ruin the tapestries. What's the matter with you lately? I'm bored. Well, you have to learn the difference between boredom and contemplation. There's a difference? Have you been practicing your Lectio Divina? Ugh, it's so repetitive. That's the whole point. If you say so. Have you confessed today? What do I have to confess about? How many times have I told you? There is grace in suffering. About a million times. Someone's been spying on us. What'd you say? I saw a guy watching us with binoculars. When? Just now, when I wasn't playing volleyball. You're imagining things. Am I? - What are you playing at, boy? - Nothing. I'm just telling you what I saw. You have a very, very vivid imagination and it's going to get you into trouble someday. You didn't see anything, do you understand me? Yes. Yes, I understand. Can you even fathom how much you mean to me, boy? Can you? If only you did. You're my salvation, boy. Now go, you'll be late for vespers. Will I see you later tonight? Yes, of course. After compline, then. After compline. Hey. Ssssup? Beatrice? Irene? Looking for something? I hadn't seen you upstairs. Well? Now you have. You look exactly like her. You can go now. About seven years ago, Agathe fell ill. She never totally got over her child being ripped away from her. When it became serious, I contacted Irene. She arrived within a few days. It hasn't been easy, she's such a sensitive girl. She seems pretty self-assured to me. She puts up a front, but it's a delicate situation. I wouldn't want her to get hurt. Don't worry about that, she hates me. I don't think she hates you at all. Oh, she hates me all right. Just give her some space, that's all I ask. Gracious God... I ask that your spirit continue to be present... with your beloved sons here in our blessed community. We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing it is the pain that we endure in this life that will ultimately lead us to redemption. We revile our mortal flesh that divides us from Him... and keeps us so far from heaven. The suffering of the present pales against the glory that will be revealed in the hereafter. As a bride of Christ, I declare to you that all your sins are forgiven. Those sins that are known and unknown in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. What have you done to yourself? Do you like it? You said you hated the scruff. I'm not sure it's quite you, but I guess I'll get used to it. - I brought you this. - Thanks. What is it? Poison. Or maybe a potion. I was wondering if you maybe want to go for a walk. A walk? What for? Just a walk, that's all. Did you talk to Beatrice? Yes, I apologized. I guess it's not so easy to find out your mother's a witch. She's not a witch. You know, after Agathe died, I felt like I was possessed by her spirit for the longest time. It was the way Beatrice looked at me. You don't have to explain. It was like witchcraft. It was as if Beatrice had deliberately conjured me to take Agathe's place. But I'm myself again now. Beatrice is like a second mother to me. So I guess you are my sister in a way? But I'm not, am I? I think I should get back to work. You know, you're just like the local boys? Completely conventional. I thought you avoided the locals. They avoid us. We are witches, after all. We eat men. I have to go. Get off! We'll have to meet again. - Where? - Here. In this clearing. When? The day after tomorrow, same time. Wait! Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! What's that for? Proof. There's your proof. I took a ride out past the monastery today, it's quite beautiful. Beautiful? It's a horrible place. Religious zealots pretending to act on God's behalf by negating themselves, it's perverse. It's very odd, one of the young monks there looks exactly like me. I can't explain it. I can explain it... you're so self absorbed, you see your own likeness everywhere. It's time for bed. Irene? Are you coming? In a little while. Don't be long. I have a twin. You're not serious. I tell you, I saw him. I spoke to him like I'm speaking to you now. - When? - Today. I've been following him and I finally confronted him. Or he confronted me. How could you have a twin without Beatrice knowing about it? It's absurd. She must know about it, you saw how evasive she was being. I saw no such thing. Anyway, there must be another explanation. Why would she keep it a secret? Here, look at this. Another picture of yourself? Your favorite subject. No, it's not me. It's him. Okay, look... Dominic, I know the last few weeks have been stressful for you, but that's all in your head. No, I'm not imagining this! You have to calm down and let me help you. I know what I saw. Fine. Then go fuck yourself! One of the young brothers has been complaining about you. He says you've been acting inappropriately with him. You tried to kiss him. The ginger? He's lying. He tried to kiss me. He can't keep his hands off me. He also said that you disappeared into the woods the other day. They had to search for you. So what if I did? I don't want you wandering so far away from the monastery. There will be no more swimming or hiking trips. You cannot be serious! The adjudicate has come to an end. It's time for your conversatio morum. To dedicate yourself solemnly to the Holy Father. You must be pious and express your committed devotion to Him. I have to go. I promised Father Boniface I'd help him with something in the refectory. You're not going anywhere until you get this into your pretty little head. You are going to do what I say and if I catch you off the grounds again, you will be severely punished. Do you understand? Do you understand? Yes. Yes, what? Yes, Father. Don't be resentful. If I'm strict with you, it's for your own good. Don't be upset. I forgive you. I'm not upset. Can't you see? You are just like St. Sebastian. Destined for greatness. But you must let me show you the path. Can I go now? How did you know about me? The nuns. They love to gossip. Nuns? The nuns that raised me before they dumped me at the monastery. What did they tell you? That my mother died giving birth to me. That I had a twin and they separated us. So you knew it was me all this time? Sure, who else would you be? How could Beatrice not know about you? Who's Beatrice? Our mother. She's alive? How is she? What's she like? I can't explain it to you. You'll have to come with me and see for yourself. No. No, I can't. I... I have to get back. Oh, God. Andrew will literally kill me if he finds out I left the grounds. Who's Andrew? Father Andrew, he's insanely jealous. Jealous? What do you mean? Is he molesting you? It's just something that happens. It's not right. And what we just did is? That's different, we're family. I don't know what to do. You have to leave with me. Don't you want to see our mother? Of course I do! But I can't just leave. Why the hell not? You don't know him. Is he violent? He thinks I'm the reincarnation of St. Sebastian. St. Sebastian? We can't let him get away with this. Dominic, don't you see? I can't leave him. Where's your motorcycle? It broke down. Well, why didn't you fix it? Uh... I haven't seen this before. Um, where's Beatrice? She's down by the river. Okay, I need to talk to her right away. - Which direction? - You can talk to her later. Listen, I'm sorry for being so sharp with you the other night. Can you forgive me? Sharp? Brutal, really... Uh... Oh, well, that's all right. I guess. You're forgiven. It's just that your story about having a twin sounded so insane. It is pretty insane, yes. I'm really glad that you're staying with us. Really. Oh God, this is crazy. What's wrong? There's something you have to know. Okay? What is it? I'm not sure how to tell you this. Just say it. I'm not Dominic. What do you mean you're not Dominic? I'm Daniel. His twin. You're a lunatic. Why are you doing this to me? I hate you. I hate you, I hate you! Dominic! I've had enough. This has got to stop. Oh, my God. Mother? I always had a feeling I was carrying twins. After that night, I buried the idea deep inside me. The thought of losing two of you was unbearable. There you are, Daniel. Father Andrew has been searching everywhere for you. I'm sorry, I was at the chapel praying. That explains it. It's the last place he would have thought to look for you. - Come with me. - Where are we going? Come, now. You know Father Andrew doesn't like to be kept waiting. This Father Andrew... Is he dangerous? Dominic says he's a monster. I'm sorry. Oh, you must have been through hell. Come on you two, get in! Oh... Let's go. Ah, shit, merde. Oh, damn car! Give it all the gas you can. Damn it. Where were you? I wasn't feeling well. I was resting in my room. You're lying, I checked your cell. I went for a walk. I trust you didn't leave the grounds? Why did you choose me? What? Why did you choose me to be your favorite? I didn't choose you, God chose you. But it could have been any of the boys, why me? You were such a precocious boy... and very curious about everything. Always asking questions, always finding new ways to challenge me. But there was something else. You seemed so lost, so disconsolate. Like there was a void in you that couldn't be filled. So that's what attracted you to me? A void? You also happened to be the most beautiful boy I'd ever seen. And that is where God lives, in beauty. I knew then that you were sent to me for a designated purpose. I want to leave the order. Leave the order? Don't be absurd. Your destiny is here with me. - With you? - With God. I didn't choose this life, it was chosen for me. God chose this life for you when he claimed your parents. You have no other family, where would you go? You're not my family. You're upset because I took away your privileges... but perhaps I was being too harsh. We'll have some wine and talk about it. Why don't you bring me the bottle? Don't be silly, you know where I keep it. Sit down, I'll get it. They threw you to the lions. Disgusting hypocrites. It was all part of the conspiracy. I'll make them pay for this. I knew it was you that day in the village. But you could never replace Daniel. Daniel is a saint. You are the devil. Daniel's not coming back. He's free. You could never take Daniel from me, he is a bride of Christ and his salvation lies here in the presence of St. Sebastian who has delivered him to me! Daniel. My Daniel. Why have you forsaken me when you know how much I love you? We will ascend to heaven now together as God always intended. We will relinquish the bondage of our corrupt mortal flesh and be united in eternity. Stop it, you two. Andrew! Andrew, it's me. It's me, Daniel. You... You're not Daniel. You're the other one, the evil one. Andrew, don't you know me? I'm the one. I'm the chosen one, remember? I'm Sebastian. No, you're lying! You're trying to trick me, you are the devil! You... You... I loved you. I did love you. Dominic. Hey, Dominic.
