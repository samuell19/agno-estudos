Faith... The most valuable in this Universe and also it is the most misused too... In this world, while there are some who are unable to stand upon the faith without enough power, there are so many who backstab to the fullest of their power. This story belongs to faith, love, backstabbing and punishment. Fido means faith. Trust. Fido Pharma group is the business empire that grew step by step by two close friends with trust as the foundation for their friendship Those close friends are Anand Prasad and Sanjay Mitra. They grew up together, studied and came to America. One is the life of another. Luckily those who understood their friendship came in as their wives And went along like them. When Anand Prasad had a son, both prayed to God that Sanjay Mitra should have a daughter. As they wished, Sanjay Mitra was blessed with a daughter. They took a decision to convert their friendship into relationship. I and Sanjay took a decision. If you decide together then that is final, tell what is that. That is to give our Aishu to Amar in marriage. You are too late. I and Lakshmi fixed for this long back. This was the God’s decision first, before all of your decisions. Jalal felt very happy for that. He’s a very important person in their lives. Though he didn’t study along with them, he grew up together with them. That’s why they brought even him to America with them. Though friends tried to convince him, he never married and remained treating them as his world and his life. The entire family decided to get Amar and Aishwarya married. Do you know how those two get a long ? Why are you so tensed? I’m unable to solve the Home work -Let me help you That’s it. Thank you. Will you always be helping me like this? Yes. Promise. Promise. Cup cakes! Amar, you too... Mom, this is really great. Aishwarya prepared them. Double A, 'A' for Aishwarya... and 'A' for Amar. While both like each other a lot, these kids live like one person. Aishu, are you ok? Aishu, are you ok? I’m sorry, are you ok? -Yes, I’m ok. Careful. Hey Jalal, come on... Hey, Lakshmi... No... No, you have to come. Come, come Aishu, good job - Hey Aishu. Even happiness became a member of their family along with these all. Saboo, he came to know that you’re stealing Drugs from Company and are selling to the drug Mafia Does he not know that all four of us are doing it together? Now he would know that. What shall we do, then? I came into this world, kicking and screaming in somebody else’s blood. I don’t mind going out the same way. For us to come into this world, we kick and tear out from our own mother’s womb. And so for living, I don’t care whatever I’ve to do. Truly scary. Please don’t do anything to me Sir. I’ve a family. Same problem, we too have the families. I’m not going to tell this to anyone Sir. Please forgive me. Not to expect badness from bad people is madness. Not expecting bad from bad guys is madness. Good shot. Delicious fish from our league. Yeah, but here is a more delicious feed for our fish. Today onwards, you four are not our employees. What? Partners. From now on, you four are 20% share holders in this company. Each one gets 5%. Thank you sir. -Thank you so much. You all deserve it. This partnership is what you earned with your own hard work. Sir,when one works hard in a Corporate Company they limit the reward to increments. Or they make them happy with bonus. But to give a partnership... It’s really great Sir. You proved once again that you think about business with brain And think about people with hearts, Sir It’s ok. Tomorrow is my son Amar’s birthday. We’re having a party at home. We’re all a family now. So, please be there. Thanks a lot Sir -Sure, thank you so much Sir There will be an end for a human’s needs but not for the greed. I feel by giving them a partnership in the Company, you gave a chance for them to think in other ways. Hey Jalal, you see everything with magnified glasses because of your over love on us. They are very nice people. Not the loyalty shown in front but the faithfulness shown behind is what is Important. God knows the truth. Nancy, this is my sister. Don’t worry James, I’ll take care of her. Thank you so much. Mr. Amar, I hope you’ll not commit a crime again. No Sir. Are you sure, you’ll not come here. Absolutely sure Sir. Absolutely sure Sir, I’ll never ever come here again. Handover his belongings. Mr. Amar, you’ve some benefits waiting for you. You got this Life insurance. You thought a lot for us to be safe even if you’re not here. Thank you, thank you dad. Bye! When we’re in danger, it isn’t the manpower around us which saves us but the strength within one self. Come in... -Nancy. James is like my Brother. Your like my sister. No, no..no.. Please keep this money. Life is unknown if you don’t see the strength hidden in the fist and the daringness in the heart. Play the game with life and compete with the time. See the victory before you die. Though there’s a path of fire and a never solving problem You should step ahead and not go back on our will power. Wrong, right or a trouble, you should create that. Let trouble and loss come, you shall win the war Wrong, right or a trouble, you should create that. Let trouble and loss come, you shall win the war Life is unknown if you don’t see the strength hidden in the fist and the daringness in the heart. Here is your food. Okay, put it on the table and go. Hello, Doctor! Mr. Rajveer. Yeah, the allergy has come back. Can you please come fast? Who are you? The axe forgets but the tree remembers. Do you remember who put that ring to your finger? Amar... Yes. Amar! It was me who added Shrimp in your food to give you an allergic attack How do you know about my allergy? Life will not forgive the weakness. Sir, here is water. Look at me, come baby. You know what Fido is? Trust, the faith. Give it back... Give it back. You don’t deserve this. You deserve this. Anti-allergic dose? Doctor will give that. This is an anti for that. When both mix, it gets toxic and the person dies. Please don’t do that. There’s no mistake from my side in what happened. Confess the mistake you did. If try to make me believe your innocent, I feel that you insulted my intelligence. It makes me very angry. I did a very big mistake. Forgive me I’m not a God to forgive and I don’t have Amnesia to forget. Don’t do that please. Please forgive me. Try to live. Try to tell the Doctor not to give the dose This is not a revenge. It’s a return gift. Oh my God.. -It's Okay... don't worry. don't worry. Relax you will be Okay. Check the pulse. Damn, he is no more. What’s the cause of death, Doctor? Nothing suspicious Sir. He died because of food allergy. What kind of food? - Sea food. Why would he eat that in spite of knowing his problems? We don’t know. If you don’t know something, don’t jump to any conclusions. Do I make myself clear? Who gave that shot? We don’t know. Send the body for postmortem. There’s a syringe mark on the leg. Ring is missing on his finger. What can be the reason? Answer is there in what you said, sir. For the ring Value of that watch is more than a crore. If robbery was the motive, why would he just take the ring and leave that? You don’t show interest in matters in which you don't have benefit, then why in this matter? I did a favor to that Rajveer - You did a favor? Of course, I charged 2 Million Dollars for doing that. Oh, deal? - Yes, deal. We thought of going to Amsterdam trip if we get that amount, along with you. So, is the trip cancelled Sir? You think I am a fool, right? - No Sir. You are wondering as to Why I am still trying to investigate when the guy who has to give money is dead. Right? I’ll tell. WATA... Whole Andhra and Telangana Association. Maa Reddy -tell me Uncle . You know why we formed this organization WATA and how we are celebrating every year? You said many times uncle - I’ll say again, listen. Tell uncle. We should remember the reason behind this, every day. Ok uncle. Without taking even a single Dollar from any one, to give free accommodation along with food better than a wedding feast is the objective. I took care of everything on my own till two years back As pressures too grew along with the age, I couldn’t continue and left it out. You put an organizing committee, right uncle? - I understood after forming that. That Miryalu idiot claims half the credit is his, if a Dog breeds four puppies. Greedy idiot! Hey brother, your shoe lace. - Thank you brother. No problem I got this special for you from Niagara falls. - Ok, thank you. Mr. Kandulu is there, right uncle? - He is full of sarcasm. He is a type to murder with just the words. Even when he invites it appears like he is insulting others. Hello Addala Sir - I’m adjusting my pant. We fixed a package of 1000 Dollars per family, It appears that we should consider even body sizes from now. Looks like Madam got angry, It is ok if that anger is shown on you but what will be our situation if it is shown on food? Hey, who is that? Push them out - He and his dirty sarcasm. And that Gandikota is the heights of false prestige (Hey moon, my cute darling...) (Song humming) Hello Sir, how are you? To touch my hand, you need a range, Maintain some distance. It may be anyone, they should keep 4 feet away from our Gandikota dynasty members. For not spreading the disease. - For you or to us? Seeing that style,one feels that he has come from some corporate family not knowing he’s the son of a graveyard keeper. And Chetan Sharma! The man is good, but his brain is dull. I’m unable to take care of everything alone Sir. Oh no... You’re very lucky dude, what if it was the right hand? That's why I’ve thought and put my left hand Sir - Have you seen? Maa Reddy - Uncle. Keep an eye on that committee I’ll keep both the eyes, you take this tablet first, uncle. I’ll show who Pulla Reddy is and who this Maa Reddy is... Don’t try to hit with caste feeling. I just have only the Telugu feeling Who is a Telugu guy? The greatest of all in the world in wearing a dhoti... A guy not going out without the scarf. I feel very happy seeing all Telugu people so close like this. Our people only think about earning income and not about any other problems. There'll be food but no time There'll be money but no mental peace. There'll be no holidays for Telugu festivals And our culture will not be there in festivals of the whites. With this same mouth taliking about pity, I’m giving an advice. Never bend for the blind faiths. When our time is running bad, some people come forward saying that they will set it right. Is this any clock to set it right? Never believe in anyone. Mainly never believe the people who come with a scarf like me. May all be good and happy. Come on clap - Standing ovation guys. Tanikella Sir, thanks for accepting our invitation and coming down. Gandikota Sir, you are feeling too much, he accepted the invitation of Pulla Reddy Sir. That’s why he came on his own flight ticket. Leave it man, show me the room first so that I can relax. You spent for your own flight ticket and can’t you book your own room? There’s a limit even for the good nature. Mall has an escalator to go up - There will be steps to get down. Moral is that none cares about us after the work is done. you are kidding me. You’ll be ruined if I curse you. What’s it sir, you just said not to believe those with a scarf and you forgot so fast? Maybe Bharani Sir got Alzheimer Forgive us Sir - So funny... Oh no, who do we have now in America? What about Kajal and Prabhudeva? - All are ready. Why do you ask like you’re boss and we’re the assistants? -What is this? What is this? - What? If you say what is that what, I’ll give answer to that. Reddy Sir used to conduct the function without collecting a single Dollar till two years back. Entry fee entered only after you came in. Special taxes wasn’t there in India two years back and it came now, right? You should encourage the change. What to encourage Sir? You’re taking 1000 Dollars each and stuffing three families in a single room. The food is so bad, we’re unable to eat that. You’ll die if you eat more so it is good only. What is this? What’s the way of answering? Don’t you have common sense? Is it not atrocious? Is there anything like good and humanity in you? We can’t answer so many questions. Gayle Yes Sir Pollard. - Yes Sir Attack - Yes. What’s this? You hit if asked? - You manhandle people? What’s this injustice, why do you hit? - Where are we? Is this America or Ambajipeta? That bald guy remembered his native place from Gayle’s shot. Don’t underestimate the power of a common man. I’ve mailed what all you’re doing in detail to Reddy Sir. Maa Reddy - Uncle. Open the mail, let’s see what has come. Uncle, time is up and you take the tablet. What’s this? I feel everything drowsy Maa Reddy. You feel a bit drowsy when you take this tablet, uncle. Not a bit dude, I’m unable to see at all. Keeping aside the mail... if you don’t give accounts this time, even that 108 won’t come here to save you. You know right? I’ve come saying a pack up for factionism. Don’t bring me back into form again. Leave no . See you Pulla Reddy Sir. For your manners and... - Leave now idiot Maa Reddy... there’s some trance in your medicine... I always feel sleepy. I’m the one erasing the localite Robert creating complications for your California Pharma unit. Your friend Rajveer had promised me 5 Million Dollars for that. Payment is still due. Mr. Balwant Kharge, who is Robert? Yes! When one goes to the father of a dead son and ask about his debts due, he conveniently would lie even in that pain stating that he doesn't know anything. Same strategy is being applied here - All wouldn’t be like that Sir. I’m talking about the majority, you don’t come in between Chidamabaram. I’ve got something for you. Your partner Rajveer’s isn’t a natural death. It was a pre-planned meticulously executed murder This is his postmortem report. You can go through this if you want to. We feel sad when a friend who accompanied in good deeds is dead. When a partner in bad deeds is killed, we get frightened. Because that death may come even searching for you. I know, whatever sins committed, by four of you... I’m sorry whatever work was done, you four always did that together. So, tell me now. Yes, now we are talking. If I was an officer working just for salary, I wouldn’t have killed Robert,right? You give me the list of those you feel are enemies and I’ll identify who’s the murderer from that. Adam Cannelon and Jeff Thompson! Brian Phillips and Steve Hawl! Anymore? Remember well, is there anyone more? There’s one more small duckling but not a threat. If Hit at the right place, even a small stone takes a life. Duckling, tell me even about that. If plan fails... - I don’t have a plan B. Just definite way is to make plan A works. Okay. I’ll find out who the threat is from these persons and come and meet you again. Then we’ll lock the deal. Chidamabaram - Sir Listening to this deal, your feeling is that it won’t work, right? To be frank, that’s true Sir. Yes, I know. My whole life may not be enough to prove something to you. Let’s see While writing the story of your life, don’t let anyone else hold the pen. Don’t put the pen writing your life history in the hands of others. Amazing. Call Devil. Can you please give me the details of Amar? That’s interesting I am not seeing it come up. What? Hey David, can you pull up Amar’s file? - Yes Sir. How is it doing over there? - No Sir, I can’t find anything on. That’s impossible, he was just here Bandipotu (Bandit) Sir Sorry Gandikota Sir. What’s this chicken like half burn corpse, damn! Why not put it slowly, why this sound pollution? Any sound other than the skull breaking noise is an irritation for you. Don’t disturb and let me enjoy the match, the next ball is a four. I see. Oh no, how did you say so like Puttaparti Saibaba? This is Cricinfo and that is late info and one over late. Come on, give that here. -Monthly subscription. Sir, did India start the batting? - Can’t you see? Come and be seated Yes, Kohli has started. If in India, I’d have started the betting by now. Feel even this as India - What’s the position of next ball? Either a four or a six. Other than out, everything is for you. What, all other than out are for me? Here is 1000 Dollars betting, come on let’s see Oh no... -Yes... He is booked. What next? Except three runs everything to you. What... except three runs, everything to me? Cover everything I lost. - I’ll do it this time. Here is two thousand Dollars. Oh.. care ful. Three runs. This time close betting Super - How it is brother? If you bet what all you have, we give back whatever you lost. What is the offer, brother? Mega offer! except run out, everything for you. Oh, is everything for me? Then here is a Credit card and a Debit card. Everything means everything Sir . The rings, bracelets, chains - Including the Rolex watch. Sir, just think for once - Go, like a bad omen for everything. Now, we don’t need a run. Just relax Hey, take care. Be careful. Take care. Out! All out here - Not out here. Who is that? New batsman entered into the crease. Who is he? A new goat. Come Sir, be seated - Have a seat. Hey, get up! even food is a waste for a gone case like you, get up. Now, my... - Sit down brother. We both shall see the match and we’ll have fun. Open it fast - Phone is not getting unlocked. Now tell me what happens in next ball. You manage... - Sir, chance is yours now. Except six... everything to you, who is the lucky guy? Wait, I will do. - I got it, I got it. 1000 Dollars Sir, don’t be in a hurry. Dhoni has just come and how’ll hit six for the first ball itself Sir? He’ll come on front foot and hit. Yes, Dhoni is always Dhoni. Sir! They snached everything from me and now it looks like you are going to snatch everything from them Sir. Rub the finger. Is charging there? If you stop your mutual meeting, we’ll go for the next ball. A small technical - Hey... Choice is yours Sir. except four, everything to you. - That’s a good deal. Let’s put that 2000 and recover everything. Four. Oh Sir, there is some magic in your mouth Sir. Wait, I’ll give a tissue and you rub it. Now, a big bet Offer Mega offer. What is that? It will go for six on off-side. Other than that everything is yours. And the bet? I’ll bet everything I have and you bet what all you have. Including watches, rings and the chains. Sir, we won’t get a better chance than this for recovery. Hey, wait rascal. Offers sounds good but the results are getting reversed. Dhoni off-side sixer is impossible. Dad always used to say that courage brings us the wealth. You all be stubborn with hands on the heart and I’ll take care of this. Take it out and put that Sir, we earned with great difficulty and got so much. Now you bet everything and I’m tensed Sir. Don’t worry bro, God is always with us. Okay. Dhoni bro! Nawab Sir! Don't keep on touching me... will get Infection. Off-side six is impossible? Should we place hands on the heart? My dad said... Is your dad NTR or you’re Balakrishna? Your background itself is a burial ground, and you're my background again? Miriyala! - How then? They were life time savings, idiot Idiot..? Then what else to say? If I hit with this bottle... I’ll just take my 1000 and all the rest is yours. Why for me Sir, you earned with hard work. I keep away from this game and this game was for you. What should I answer my wife when she asks about these extra items? Many thanks Sir . - This... Just give this watch, my in-laws gave that If you give me the phone, I’ll leave. You snatched everything and will you take even this? ( Song humming...) That mean... This is fraud, it’s cheating. Yes Tit for tat! This Akbar never tolerates lies and cheating. for every lie I strip everyone. I will chase down and hit, rascals! This fellow has followed us like a devil. You saw every ball like a student copying in exam. And he saw for once and remembered the whole over. Did you watch him seeing? - Yes Sir. Why didn’t you say when you saw? - How could I say when he was seeing, Sir? Why not give a signal? - How do I signal when he is seeing, Sir? Ok dude, don’t get angry. You’re correct. These four aren’t there amongst the persons you doubted. They really aren’t there now. Jesus! Then who? - The Duckling. The duckling has become death Amar - Yes, Amar. Did he release from the jail? Guy growing in between many kids, I mean growing with brothers and sisters will have great brain. And he grew up together for 14 long years with 2300 very hard core Jackson prisoners. There’d be 2300 reasons for those 2300 criminals to be caught. He knows all those very well. Even before he got released from Jail, he took care to erase all the evidences about him in the jail. Nobody knows where he stays, how he looks and how he would come. No one knows it Honestly speaking, I feel all three of you are in a very dangerous situation. Death in an invisible form is very close to you. So, now tell me how much are you going to pay me for saving your lives? You tell me? How do I know the value of your lives? How can I know that? One Million Dollars. I may not know the value of your lives. But I know very well about the value of your properties. Life is very important for you to enjoy them Think and quote. Why to bargain with him? We have the devil, right? When devil comes close and says you can’t withstand the storm, he says in that devil’s ear that he’s that storm. Bullets aren’t enough to handle him, but you need to have brains. So, consider everything calmly and quote the price. 5 Million Dollars. Yes, deal done. I’ll very soon find him out and finish him legally, ok? You should come in time when money is taken, right? -Yes. That basic punctual... You are... I’m Pooja, event Manager This is my team. I’m Chanti Miryala, treasurer of this committee and payment section. Hello Sir. The decoration is damn good, great job actually... Thank you, our Moni did this. And sound system is splendid, excellent actually Thank you so much, Sony is done it. Hello. It’s me who selected you after carefully studying your previous prestigious works. Actually, this is my first major event. I think, there’s a mistake in the report. This guy wrote it He’s my boy - Hello. If you have any problem, any time, call me. 24/7 I’m available. Thank you Sir - Really nice meeting you. Thank you, I’ll carry on. I’ve lots of work. Excuse me... - Yeah. Damn! She came like dry fruit into my dry life. She’s made for me I think golden days of Pullanna Sir is started again All items are super. Sarma Sir, ice cream is great. Hey girls, come here. What’s her domination without my permission? Who takes the responsibility when what all we saved with great difficulty is emptied? Looks like something is running bad, there in the morning and here now. Enough. See Sony, eventually at the end of the day money is everything. Why not ask for our permission before doing something. It’s basic. She isn’t doing all this with your money to take your permission. Then? Unable to see the pain of the guests, she booked extra rooms and arranged quality food with her own money. Is a girl working for her living doing all this? Excuse me, Pooja works for passion. By the way, she’s filthy rich. Let’s go girls Kandula...Come on, let’s go and eat. It seems all the items are great - Money of the others is very sweet. Poor fellow, thought to trap her showing the financial difference and what will you do now? I’ll put in extra effort. If I trap Pooja, even life gets settled along with marriage. Just go and check that for me Pooja madam. Though you had no link to the guests, you did everything for them. Your heart is so great. I’m very happy. You’re also feeling so happy though you have no relation to them. I too am happy - Thank you. Every murderer will have a style, including the psycho killers. Easy target for Amar coming out from the jail isn’t Rajveer, but Vikram Talwar. But why did he kill Rajveer? Fido! Did Rajveer also have the same ring? Yes - Yes But, that ring wasn’t there on the finger of dead Rajveer. There’s a clue. There’s a connection to it. I want to know all the stories behind these rings. Now I got the answer. He’s going in a well organized manner and in an order. I’m sorry to say this Mr. Vikram Talwar, but Amar’s next target is you What? My total focus from now on is on you. Why are you focussing the guy who is going to die rather than on the guy who is going to kill, Sir. Hey Chidamabaram, they’ll get offended. You shouldn’t talk negative before the customers I said it is easy to catch that guy by following him. Got my point? Got it sir. Famous peace messenger, person who has stopped world wars successfully, KA Paul’s descendent... Hearty welcome to Junior Paul! Please give him a big round of applause. Enough, give it here now. Sir, it’s a honor. Thanks for coming Sir Hello! It is personal. we don't care for such things. She is my personal He doesn’t know that Paul is great! Disciple’s salutes to Senior Paul Sir! Presidents and Prime Ministers call me for prayers across 148 nations. Look if you want to, they published in Times of India, in Economic Times... and wrote even in Sitara and Santosham. Paul is great! Master called me recently at late night And said you should give the message at the celebrations of Telugu brothers. I was shocked and said, “me, master?” He said are we different, if I’m milk you’re butter milk Still, when he went on to moon for Universal peace, he patted on my shoulder with love saying World peace is my responsibility. After that he flew in 747 Boeing for vacation to Australia And I came here to America for this occasion. With his blessing, I reached to a stage of flying in Boeing from a stage of collecting coal. Good tie up, you burn and he would collect the coal. Kandula, who do you think he is? -He said it, right? Original is different, he is an expert in black magic and is the killer whom I called to kill Pulla Reddy. He is a demon in human form What’s this coloring of a peace messenger? It’s his covering to cheat the public He uses Mr. Paul’s name for that. The hard work you do to do the good! So, the message I would give to you is to be happy with 3 lemons and 6 chilies. Oh my Paul! Once when we had gone to meet Bush, we gave lemons and did the prayer and he became the President Next when we had gone to meet Obama, We prayed giving the chilies and he became the President. Similarly the growth and peace at the soul for all! Oh my Paul! Wishing for a mental peace for all, may Ghosts bless you! Mr. Paul! May God bless you Hey girl... 407. Hello Bandipotu Sir Sorry Gandikota Sir That word sorry is sounding more insulting for me Leave that, Pulla Reddy Sir is strong like the elephant at the temple. Will the work be completed by that waste fellow Junior Paul? Slowly... Hey, you go out - Why Sir? Hey, go. His dad is Khadra, Bista Khadra His name is Darkha, Bista Darkha Why build up like Basha, Manik Basha? When dad is from Bista, will son be from Palasa? Respect Miryala, he kills right with his looks. Is he any Balaiah Babu to kill with looks? Don’t unnecessarily elevate him Sir. His dad Bista based on budget with various black magic tricks used to silently finish plants to trees, cubs to buffaloes and kids to men without any mercy. What’s he doing now? People with a revenge over him, caught him, broke his teeth, tied him to a tree and burnt him alive. Khadra furious with that - Did he turn dark? Turned into a Dracula - Oh no! He crossed even Khadra in black magic - Damn! Hello, we’re in a serious discussion and who called you here? Not when call comes but Akbar comes in when he gets a doubt. I studied him - You did? My mind says... Not like a Peace messenger, but he looks to be a black magic guy This is Akbar. I peel the devil’s skin and beat it up till it runs away. Hello Sir What Mr. Junnu Paul? You stare so harshly at us and bend your head in fear seeing that fellow. We’ve doubts on your capacity Do you have? - Yes Do you have? - Yes Is there a tree? Yes, Darkha Sir. Let us meet there tomorrow at Sunrise - Sunrise means Even his dad was so. In 70s... - Go away idiot. He asked to come early in the morning, is it for breakfast? -Let us go and see He will be... - Oh no, the tree. Is it there? No tree and no doubts, master. I’ll say the requirements to kill Pulla Reddy, write down. - Ok Master ¼ Kg flour 1 Kg Ghee 3 Lemons - Ok. And 6 chilies -Ok Master, I’ll bring right away from Walmart. That is not acceptable. -Then which way? Rice flour made from organic rice brought from Araku Ok. Ghee from the cow born to Ongole bull and Punganur cow Get Lemon from Nimmakur and Chilies from Miryalaguda. It’s better to get Special status for the state than all these master. Mr.Pal - Master Mr. Babu will take care of that. First, you do what I said. Master, I need a favor - Tell me. I saw a girl just yesterday and she should be fall for me in a week. She will vomit blood and fall down, go get all I said in double dose. Master What’s wrong again? I got to marry her. It’s totally a different scenario. I see You do something and make her fall in love first and then I’ll do something for the marriage. What’ll you take care after he takes all the strain? - I’ll mix the dough. Paul Sir. It’s human effort first and God or the devil comes after that. Ghost bless you - Thank you Grand Master. Yes, Sarojini Naidu... Who are all these? Are they missing? What! They’re famous people of our country Few kids here when asked who is father of nation are saying George Bush. When asked Andhra Kesari, they’re saying Abraham Lincoln. I thought it would be like reminding our culture and the great people of our nation. Hey, great minds think alike! I too conduct such classes on weekends and educate the children. My boy literally worships me. He always says boy like I’m an office boy. Seeing all these like this, I feel like seeing my childhood friends after a long time, extremely Nostalgic Is it? You know who these are? He’s come, He’ll teach him a lesson. Hey man, what work do you have here? This is our culture and our tradition. Not about the caste or religion, but of the nation. My India is great Who is he? Come on Say... The horse is dead. (There is no time my friend, is it a compromise or a war?) Got it. Gauthamiputra Satakarni by Krish Wow, what knowledge. Even I get surprised many times looking at my talent and my boy literally... Huh, not possible for me to bear for so many times - Got it. Then, who is he? - With pleasure (I’m like Telugu language present there and even here.) Again got it, He has a beard and so he is Gona Ganna Reddy. He is there and here also Wow, what a logic if he has beard then Ganna Reddy and when in a dhoti he is Rajasekhar Reddy You said it very well Sir Ok, who is he then? Horse is in the background and the beard looks trimmed. Sword is too significant Kathi Mahesh, I don't think it’s him. Why not? If he has Kathi(sword) then he is Kathi Mahesh And if he has a Ganta (bell), then he’s Ganta Srinivasa Rao. Shut up! First one is Sri Krishnadevaraya. They say him King of literature and war and possessor of all arts. The second is Alluri Seetharama Raju, they say he is the warrior of Manyam. He made the British pee. He is making you pee - Cut the crap. He’s Sivaji Maharaj and they call him Chatrapathi. Chatra... Why’s he not having similarities to Prabhas then? He’s not filmy Chatrapathi but Chatrapathi from history I know it I’m testing whether he knows it or not. In between for entertaining you all, I acted like not knowing anything.

Bro, who is this person coming. - Fido Pharmacy Vice Chirman, Mr. Vikram Talwar He is also the owner of 12 Casinos and he’s the chief guest this year. Hello, you became a great man. He means you’re a great man. He has a language problem. All problems are created because of them They collected 1000 Dollars from each guest And snached it all without providing any facilities. Hey man, shut up. Why all these for him? He’s a great man. You won’t listen to us like this. Pollard, Gayle! You tell me Sir, is it wrong to cheat the people who believed? It’s wrong. Then, should there be a punishment for cheating or not? Should punishment be there or not? Yes, should be punished Then, should implement immediately. Say it all to Pulla Reddy sir upstairs. These idiots are not letting us meet. Sure Leaving aside about the payment done or not, We got the set ready by Art Director Prakash We’ve put Thaman in room for three days, didn’t let him sleep and made him do a song. I made that Viswa fellow do hard work and made him write the lyric as per my taste. After we did so much is Kajal not coming now? Even Prabhu Deva isn’t coming. -Oh no. What’s this? We told them that we will pay immediately after the program, right? We should have the credibility, right? Understood This for sure is a blow by Mr. Tanikella Bharani. What about your blow to him? My grandma used to say - Just shut your filthy mouth. You and your dirty grandma Hey, audience will make a mess if there isn’t a program on the final day of the event. It’s tough to control them. We shall arrange for tear gas - Get it. No need. I’ll replace Kajal I’ll match Prabhu Deva and the issue is closed Hey man, don’t talk senseless. Pooja madam can match Kajal but Prabhu Deva is a professional dancer This is Akbar and a pure entertainer. This show is a sure shot blockbuster. Hey, hello... hello... Don Bosco.

Come and be seated Will you have a peg? - Happily, make a large It’s ready, have it - Go on. Yes man, you always say that you will strip the lies and uncover the cheating, right? You made our Miryala into Pepper powder and what will you do with us? What did you do? You are great people. Are we great men? That Pulli guy said not to collect from anybody. We pulled 1000 Dollars per head. He said free accommodation - We made that also into paid accommodation. Have you seen their bad deeds, Maa reddy? Come on in Mr. Maa Reddy. He keeps you so high, always calling you by name. But Pulli guy doesn’t know that you are our man. -That is the matter What has he done? He looks like an idiot. Old man used to always make nuisance to come down. I used to give him 10 tablets a day and put him to sleep. If I had given four more tables, he would have died with Kidney failure. You made the public into fools taking 1000 Dollars each from those poor fellows They are not fools but crazy idiots. They couldn’t do anything though we did whatever we wanted to. They dress in blazers over their bellies. You know one more thing? They feel it was Royal Salute they drank and don’t know what we mixed in this. What are you all here? Go Gayle! Pollard! Both are out How did they know about all this matter? I gave a live connection and as I informed... I strip and hit for lies. I chase and beat up. You should give three years accounts with penny. They already said Reddy Sir, they said Bahubali record and 3.3 Million. You tell them the recovery date You should give back everything in week days. Chetan Sharma. I liked your loyalty and fear in sin very much. Sir. You’re WATA President next year. - Thank you Sir. Why are you crying ? - You got beaten up because of us, master. All these are common in our families. Darkha Sir, you turned as a Dracula when they hit your father How should you turn when they hit a Dracula now? They should be burned into ashes Not turning to ashes but we should finish that Pulla Reddy That anyways is fixed. But, what to do with that man who diverted this onto you? This looks like a personal revenge - You shut up. Arrange all items in double dose and we shall finish even that guy. Ok Master. One more small matter -Tell me. Pooja. I don’t do normal prayers(Pooja) other than the black magic. This isn’t that Pooja (Prayer) master, but about my Pooja. You go straight to her and say what’s in your heart. He may not be able to bear if she says the words of heart. Hey Chetan Sharma, both your language and body language have changed after Pulla Reddy made you the President. You pass satires on me, rascal? Nothing as such Sir, I became the President with your blessings. I’m unable to bear this one dude. You stop and you say master. Mr. Paul - Tell sir. Go and tell tomorrow morning at 7:32 and 45 seconds. Master, there. She is the one I’m coming baby - See the time idiot. Hey, babe... your looking fab. Come out with me, I’ll show you a good time. Trust me. Trust me baby! Sweety! Trust me - Come on Sweety, trust us. Trust me Trust me - Trust us. Trust me - Trust us. Trust me - Trust us. Trust me baby - Trust us. Trust me -Trust us only Trust me -Trust us. Trust me - Trust us. Ok Master, bless me Kshmora blesses you See you, master blaster - Go, beat it. Trust us. Trust me -Trust us. Paul sir..! when I am asking him to fix her up. why is she hitting them. The idiot’s down, oh no! Oh no...! Master, master! Master is gone! Jeez! Why do you hold me Master? - Oh no! Why did you fear and come back, master? I came back with a fear that I may reverse back. But you said this was a good time? - That is as per the Indian time. It’s all different here, right? You should take care of that in advance, right? You stay here, right? You should take care Correct Master. Something bad is come into her - What to do then, Master? Let her go and look for another girl No compromise Master. Comparing with the plusses of her, this is a very small minus. I’ll make this minus to plus and fix up only to her. Just give your blessings and rest is history Do whatever but follow India time this time Ok Master, master blaste - Dakhra blesses you. Oh my God, did I behave so violently? -It’s really scary Pooja. You must consult a psychiatrist. I studied deep, enquired allover net, enquired all, researched for who is the best and... Come to the point Sorry dear. I found the greatest Psychiatrist in the entire Solar system. Not just in America but he has branches even in Europe. And he being in New York now is luck. But getting the appointment today itself is my effort. Why trouble for you? - Love on co-Telugu people. You don’t think of anything else. His appointment is very precious. And your situation is very dangerous. Everything will be set, he is a great Doc. All are in the same expression, who’s the patient? We’ll say who’s the patient later, but say who are you first. I’m Antony, Dr. Mark Antony. Sir, we all know that you are Akbar and enough of the dramas Who’s Akbar? I’m Dr. Antony, MD, MPA, FRCPF. Can’t you see the board? Dr. Mark Antony, you think it’s a double role? Will there be a double role in real life? - Aren’t fight masters Ram-Lakshman there? Yes. Still, I won’t believe till I test. Relax. Her name is Theresa, Mother Theresa. Oh, nice name. Relax! Her name isn’t Theresa but Pooja Then why did you say Theresa? I lied It’s guaranteed that he will get a slap now. I cheated on a purpose Relax, it’s for a purpose right? We too lie often as a part of treatment. I’m strong, you’re strong and we’re all strong. Relax! You say he’s really a Doctor - He isn’t Akbar as you’re still alive. Correct. That Akbar used to always be on fire saying he will chase and beat us up. But this guy is saying relax and talking to me by making me sit in recliner. Doctor... - Yes. Let me be truthful, she’s the patient. She’s really a person like Mother Theresa but yesterday she suddenly behaved like a Martial Arts fighter. Pooja, please show him the video. Imagine Sir, I saw in live. Extremely painful and you have to fix it Sir, please. Relax! I need to talk to the patient. Okay. Can you both wait outside? How long to wait dude? What do I know Sir. -That's why you are called half mental... If you say will it happen.? Excuse me. Sorry. Doctor is calling you inside. She has a problem called Dissociative Identity Disorder. Is it like in 'Aparichutudu' movie, Doctor? Exactly! But not exactly It’s not that all do behave like that. In this case this girl is behaving something violently. Nothing to worry, it’s curable. Thank you Doctor. In fact, Doctor should thank me. Why should I say thank you? Because of me you got this patient and are getting the fees, right? The Problem you have is bigger than what she has - What’s that Sir? If she has Identity disorder, he has Identity Crisis. What are the symptoms of that, Doctor? Saying everything is because of him and when it fails to push the blame on others. Cruel thoughts inside and positive Tweets outside. I stubbornly tell you Doctor... you are a Doctor. In fact, you too have a problem Karma is a bitch! you tell Doctor. Low IQ. You said it correctly Doctor. He is half minded, what are the symptoms Doctor? Roaming around the wrong people and to believe frauds. Correct Doctor, I admit You shut it. What is Pooja’s treatment now, Doctor? She needs some meditation and therapy. For a violent girl to become silent, she has to fall in love. But Doctor, I’m already in love with her - One side love Doctor. You do one thing, I asked her to wait in Mediation room You go and say words from your heart straight without any nonsense. Sure Doctor, it’s high time. I hope both of your problems will be solved. I’m strong, you’re strong and - We all are strong. Relax! See Pooja... I thought of saying this right at WATA. And due to some unforseen circumstances, I couldn’t. That's why I’m waiting to say the word in my heart from five and half days. I too am wishing to tell you something from long back. Oh, fantastic. Then, we shall go one by one. You please start I’m in love with a man. Oh my God. Who’s he? - I don’t know. Where does he stay? - I don’t know Rubbish. You don't who he is, where he stays and loving an underground fellow like that makes no god damn sense, dear. Any random person will tell that. Smiling Doctor told me to convey this. So,listen peacefully and calmly without interrupting. I love you. Yes, I love you. If you say ok, I’ll keep you in flowers lifelong and take care. Sunday Jasmines, Monday Roses, Tuesday Tulips and bla bla bla... All I’m expecting from you is mutual trust! Yes, please trust me. I beg you to trust me, because it is all about the trust. Trust is a must. Must is the best, so automatically trust is the best. So don’t adjust. Just trust, Trust... Trust... Trust... Will you Pooja? Oh no, what are those wounds? Sir, what happened? That smiling Doctor will ask the same question And you can enjoy listening to that time. They hit you like a mad dog. Who is it? You can’t wait, right? - Come on Sir. I can see you, dude - No, no. Mr. Chanti, what happened? - Again, smile No situation can affect you. I’ll narrate Doctor. I went inside. Success. What success, Doctor? It’s a total disaster. No Mr. Chanti, think cool She said there’s guy in her heart. But she says don’t know where he’s and who he’s. So, if we trace him out, problem is solved. Tracing him out, their problem gets solved and how’ll my problem be solved Doctor. No, no...you’re not getting my point Chanti. Suppose, if he’s married already... We can say he’s married, pull him out of her heart and push you inside. How would we know where he is, Doctor? From now onwards, that should be your mission. Your work is to search and trace him out. I’m strong, you’re strong and We all are strong. - We all are strong. Relax! Chidamabaram, look at this. The ring is missing again. Yes Sir. In the CC camera footage we got, we’ve the visual of Akbar saving Vikram Talwar. You’re right. In fact even Vikram called and told this to me. Bomb blasts are on at the Central Park. I just met with an accident also. But luckily Akbar saved my life. Catching this Akbar, we may get some clue. Vikram Talwar’s sins got ripened and he died. You should be careful dear. That’s why uncle, I changed the name Aishwarya, Which all at our house like and am living with the identity Pooja. Call me as and when you have any need, dear. Ok uncle. Hello... Morning. Doctor... Doctor... -Hey, Chanti relax. How to relax Doctor, when it’s going so bad there? What happened? Pooja is gone to Times Square. Let her go and what will go bad from that? -She’s gone alone. It seems she said not to return till evening. That means the stranger will come there for sure. Come on, let us go. -Why me? You only told that you will remove that guy and push me in, right? To remove him, you should see him right? Yes, correct. Come on then, how can you be so cool Sir? - Relax, relax my boy. Why do you look around, look there. There is the beauty If Pooja is having such a sad face, definetly it means she is waiting for the undercover stranger. Maybe. What maybe, it must be. You should somehow take him out from that heart and push me in. I’ll try. - You better. You keep focusing and I’ll get you a cappuccino. Dad... Hey Aishu... -Jallal. You four from now are 20% share holders in this Company Tomorrow’s my son Amar’s birthday. We’re having a party at home. We’re all a family now. If the bosses come to know facts about us, then it's danger. We should start the story only after we write the end. We’re already 20% share holders in the Company. From now, 100% is ours. How...? Entire Fido family is going to be finished in tomorrow’s birthday party. Happy birthday... Happy birthday to you. Has Aishu become more than me to you, right? These uncles are our family members from today. Like I, Sanju uncle and Jalal uncle have, even these uncles should have Fido rings in their hands. May God bless you Prince! Hey Lucky, wait up. Lucky come back here! Lucky come back here! Bad boy, Lucky... Stay! Come here. Mom! Dad! Mom! I went to WATA on September 17th. Where was I on 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st? I killed Vikram Talwar on 22nd. Again what happened to me on 23rd and 24th? What exactly is happening to me? Tomorrow is 25th. Dad’s birthday! I should go to Greenwoods Cemetery and pay homage. It has to happen. Nothing should happen to me again by then. It has to happen. You spoke the deal to save us three. Vikram Talwar died. Amar! He seems to be a man eater I’m a tiger hunter - What’ve you done? Why blabbering as tiger hunter when they’re so angry Sir? Shut up. Tomorrow is 25th September. Maybe you forgot, I didn’t forget. Tomorrow is Anand Prasad’s birthday, right? That Amar hunting you all in such organized way, He will definitely come to Greenwoods Cemetery to pay homage. He will definitely fall in my trap. It’s confirmed. Guys, when FBI wants to nab some one, they will get every emotional info. They set a trap and each connection you got they go for every details. Watch out you will be seen. God Damn! Only our family knows that Anand uncle likes roses. That means Amar! Happy birthday uncle. I’m waiting for Amar. Bless that we meet soon. Kharge - Hello, tell me. Have you got him? I’m very close by Sir. Definitely I’ll catch him Kill that bugger and tell me. I’ll come and see his bloody face. -Where are you Sir? I am at columbus circle waiting in the car. Sir, he just got missed. -It’s me who just got missed. If this car wasn’t bullet proof, I would’ve been dead. Go and get that Idiot! - Yes Sir Doctor, what happened Doctor? Akbar, right? He isn’t Akbar, but Antony. Dr. Antony! Is it? Both look alike. look alikes But I’m Pooja and he’s my Doctor. Excuse me... Doctor, can I talk to you for one second please. -Yeah. Akbar, Antony! Amar, Akbar and Antony! There’s something fishy Actually Doctor, about my problem... with you in detail. Doctor! Doctor! Who would have placed the second bouquet? Damn! I missed him. Even they influenced FBI. On another hand, something is happening to me. I’m not totally perfect. Why’s there the second bouquet? Who put this? Amar, Akbar, Antony! Is it just a rhyme? Or is there a relation also? I don’t understand what’s happening to me and how it is happening. Why did Amar after listening to the glass breaking sound turn as Akbar? We’re all strong. Why did Amar change to Antony after seeing the psychic patient? Amar, what's happen? I’m not Amar but Antony. Dr. Antony. And what’s wrong with my dress? I’m looking funny. The reason for turning back to Amar after hearing the bomb blast sound, Is Dissociative Identity Disorder. There is a strong reason for Amar to have got this psychic problem. Some girl is thinking I am Dr Antony. The FBI officer called me Akbar. Why...? what is happening? However big criminal you maybe, whatever powerful your revenge maybe ... You can't escape from this FBI officer Balwant Kharge. It’s not the manpower around us which saves us from the real danger, but our strength within. I haven’t forgotten what you said, uncle Whatever strong maybe the enemy and whatever maybe my weaknesses, they can’t escape from my stubborn will to kill them. Brother, one plate of this, that, that one and that All are for him only - Yes. Must be hungry for a month. Ghost Bless. What’s he saying? He said stomach will blast eating all those. He said it or you added? - He said Sir. They would feel happy when customers come but won’t pass satires. Oh no Pulla Reddy Sir - Sweets? No, my husband - When did you marry him? Come on smile Good morning Sir - What about my accounts? We’re at the financier on the same job Sir. We’ll repay slowly even by mortgaging our properties Not slowly but fast. You just have four days time. Ok Sir, see you. You said that Pulla Reddy will vomit blood and die in three days. Why’s he still not dead? What shall I do? - Then who will do? Paul Sir - Sorry Sir. There’s some fault in the material you brought. Fault? - Yes. Impossible, I got them as it is. Say what you brought once. Ghee of the cow born to Ongole bull and the Punganur cow. Stop there, fault is right there What did I say? Ghee of cow born to Punganur bull and Ongole cow Why do you blame me with mistakes at your end? Hey man, record whatever he says and send it to that Guntur guy in WhatsApp. If not he would say fault is in the flour. Why would I say anything if you bring everything correctly, waste rascal? It means it is beautiful? -Why is the food not coming still? You spent whole childhood happily with people all around you. I feel bad seeing you live alone now, dear. I’m living with the confidence that happiness would also return along with Amar, uncle. I’m still unable to forget the incidents that took place. Hey Jalal, please bring a bottle dude - No, you’re already high. Kids are still playing Just for today dude. Please get it Okay. Hey Lucky, wait up Amar, wait for me Lucky. Amar. Saboo, can we go ahead? Yeah, we are safely away. Ok! One blast is enough. Fire accidents happen more in this season due to the heaters. We kept the gift packs we got just beside them. There are four Gasoline packets in them In fact, one is enough to bring the entire house down Not even one would be left behind, trust me Lucky. Mom, dad! Oh God. what happened? Amar.. Amar. Hey Sanjay! - Dad Aishu... Mom - Dad. Mom... Oh Damn! If you tell them, we’ll kill all of you We don't have anyone now, uncle. What will do now..? It isn’t the manpower that saves us when in real danger... but it is the strength within us. Seeing a house so calm now, which till yesterday was so playful, we feel very sad Jalal Sir. They always helped if possible but never harmed anyone. Not understanding why this happened to them. Are you missing mom and dad? You know one thing? - What uncle? All those dead live in that forest. You can see them if you go there. Really uncle? Yes, trust me. Go Aishwarya! Aishu! Aishu! Aishu! Aishwarya! Did you see Aishwarya? I saw someone going towards the forest. It may be Aishwarya That is a hunting area. There would even be Coyotes. Mom! Dad! Baby Aishu! - Aishu Aishu Aishu Mom! Dad! Are you ok? Yes - Let’s go. Hey Aishu, why did you come here alone dear? Uncle... If you tell him, I will kill you all. We cut the trees easily. It’s taking time to pluck out the plants. I like this comparison. Plants absorb poisonous gas and give Oxygen Plants above absorb Carbon monoxide we exhale and give properties we need. It takes 10 minutes to die for elders. Five minutes is more than enough as they are kids. Amar! Aishu! Hey Amar, open the door. Open the door please. Aishu! Aishu, open the door please Aishu! Amar! Amar! Amar! Hey, get up. Amar, get up Amar... -I’m ok uncle. Get up Amar. Aishu Aishu... Aishu. Aishu... Aishu, are you ok? Come on get up, come on run. - Aishu. come on run. Come dear, fast.... fast. Come on fast. Amar. Stop... Stop. Damn it! Get the vehicle Is it those who killed our parents too? Yes Amar, I’ve seen. He threatened to kill all if I say. That's why I didn’t say. We shouldn’t leave anyone of them, uncle. We’re not leaving but postponing. Right now my responsibility is to save you. We’re going to Detroit. At any cost, none should know who we are. Don’t tell anyone about our details. Make it quick Uncle, coffee... Uncle, coffee... It’s better if all those who gave me loans are dead. I’m unable to freely roam outside. Oh no! Looks like all the loan givers formed a syndicate. Why did I get caught like this? You didn’t expect to get caught, right? Hey Bobby idiot, if you don’t pay us all today I’ll get you beaten to scrap and push you in. Hey Sai, take off your hands What rascal, raising on those who gave you loans? This car is mine - Yours? If not yours? Without finance, I took a debt and bought it. Huh, why do we care about how you bought it? What is our situation? That’s why I’m saying to sell this, Share amongst for the loans and send me the balance. Take - Thanks. Huh, who needs your thanks? Give me 2000 For what? You want me to go by walk? It’s for cab expenses. Hey no need, my mind is changing. Give me my keys back. Hey, wait dude. Here, take it. It gives great mileage dude. I’m feel like crying. It’s bad time and let go the car. Hey Sai, it’s like winning World cup with Zimbabwe team To collect the debt from Bobby. Yes dude. Hey, this key isn’t of this car - Oh no, Bobby cheated us again. Hey, come on guys. These idiots don’t even have the sense not to run in this Times Square. See Sai, how is he running? His heart would stop and die, idiot. Hey, who are you? Sir, you look to be a Telugu man, please help me Sir. Who are all those? - Who gave me loans Sir My name is Bobby, Sir. I’m an illegal immigrant. I’ve a strength and weakness. What are they? I take loan from all within 10 minutes of introduction. I spend it all within 5 minutes after I get the loan in the casino. With this rare combination one Lakh Dollars of debt And 100 debtors have accumalated. My passport is in mortgage and future is in risk. I’m penny less, homeless, hopeless and jobless I’ll give you the job Thank you Sir What’s that Sir? - Babysitter Who’s the baby, Sir? - Myself How can you be a baby Sir? - I have a peculiar problem. You should observe me 24/7 and say what’s happening to me I’ll pay you one Lakh Dollars if you do that correct. Brother! You should know what’s happening to you, right? I’ll show it direct to your eyes. If you take a left there, I’ll push in my luggage and it’s light weight. Oh no, lift direct into the flat? It’s very spacious. How much would it be? Everything is open for you, except that room - What’s in that room Sir? Sorry Sir I’ll freshen up and come, then we can have dinner together. Aren’t there no drinks before dinner Sir? As you wish Sir is too rich... but no use. He needs my support like Sasikala for Jayalalitha God has shown me a way and I shouldn’t misuse this. What’s happening to him and what’s there in that room? I should pull out everything during drinks time and backstab him genuinely. Please be seated Sir. This is my favorite brand Sir. I’ve been thinking to have this from so long. Have it Bobby. Enough Bobby Everything is ruined after these idiotic diets have come up We should eat, drink and enjoy to the fullest. Cheers What’s happening to you exactly Sir? Knowing that is your job I need some details about you for me to get into the job, Sir Ask. Your name - Amar. Flash back - I won’t say Ok, say about your likes. Your favorite food? Loose dal, potato fry and cup cakes Favorite movie - Brave Heart. So, he likes revenge. Favorite Hero - Brad Pit. I got some information. If you cooperate like this, we... Sorry Sir, Sorry. I will be back sir, I will clean it. Huh! This is the problem with these glass bottles, they break when they fall down. They say plastic is cancer. Steel bottles are better though they are expensive. It’s like bottle didn’t break at all and looks neater than before Sir. Who are you? I’ve got none other than the debtors Sir. Hey, who are you rascal? - It’s me Sir, Bobby Bobby - Yes. Why am I here and what’s this dress? Why is he talking differently? - Tell me Bobby, why am I here? You are in your house - Is this my house? Being over drunk, this idiot is thinking his house is mine. He forgot his own house just with one peg. Let me get him fully drunk, then I can drive him out and loot the house. Bobby, say one thing. What’s the connection between you and me? Friends Is Bobby Akbar’s friend? Yes. Then, you first said Sir - Not Sir, but I said sorry. You forgot. You come to my house for party and drink less? Have it dude Pour it dude - You pour, don’t you have hands? Pour it. Pour as much you wish to. He has taken such a large peg. Drink it, drink. Drink full and die. Where is Achar (pickle), dude? - Who is Achar? Achar... Pickle, for munching - It’s broken dude. There would be glass pieces and you shouldn’t eat. You’ll die. I’m not getting sleep... If you leave fast, I’ll sleep Ok, you sleep dude Go man, don’t come back again He’s gone. I’ll loot everything and shift to Vegas. I’ll go around all the casinos. Will I leave the strip ball or what? Las Vegas, be ready! Why is he coming back? Hey... Why did you come back again? I got a doubt - What doubt? Is there a friendship in between us for real? - Yes dude Looking at your side look and breath, my brain says - What does it say? You’re saying a lie and are cheating I get hurt if you say so You know about me, right? - Is it? You too know about me? - A to Z... You just said right? What’s my full name? - Amar Akbar. I asked for full name - Full name? Jodha Akbar? Jalal Akbar... Usmed Jalal Akbar... Mohammed Bin Usmed Jalal Akbar! Stop it! Looks like your parents gave such a big name just to hit me This Akbar will not accept a lie and doesn’t excuse the cheating. Then what will you do? I’ll strip and bash up. No need, I’m saying the truth. This is your house Sir Is this my house? Does Akbar stay here? No, Amar stays - Amar. Who’s Amar? Why do you ask who’s Amar? Akbar has come out from Amar. looks like he’ll not settle unless he has a peg Brother, take a break and have a peg. - Ok, let's carry on. We should enjoy when we drink and not fight. What else will be there other than pain. Don't indulge in violence, instead be good. We’re all strong. Looking at the smile, looks like the sadist guy is gone. We can’t believe him and better let me check. Akbar bro, hello Sir - Who’s Akbar? Oh! You took a small break and returned in a snapshot. Welcome back Amar Sir. Who’s Amar? I’m Antony, Dr. Antony One more again? Which type is he? Cool or cruel? Where am I? Where am I? My house... No! Your house... No! You are in the house where we live together. Roommates! Oh, looks like I came for a home visit to treat the patient. Relax! What’s your name? - Oh, I didn’t tell you right? Did you tell to anyone else? I told Amar Sir and I told Akbar Sir Who are all those? - It’s you. Proso Pognosia What’s that? - Your problem It’s so problematic even to say and what’s this problem Sir? Unable to recognize faces, you see all faces alike. I had this problem while watching the Chinese films. I normally don’t have it Sir You’re better - Is it? Many patients don’t accept their problems You’re accepting your problem No way out, Doctor. I can report after the original comes back, if I get to know about his tastes. What’s your favorite food, Doctor Sir? Chicken Sandwich. Your favorite film? - Inception. Your favorite director is Christopher Noolan, right? Your right. Yes, he is the director of that film Doctor Sir Bobby, I don’t why but I’m feeling sleepy. Place your legs on that table and sleep. You sleep well Sir, we don’t have works now to do urgently He isn’t a single baby, but a triple baby Why do I care about all these? I should give the report in the morning and leave taking that one Lakh Dollars. He seems to be watching some action film. Idiot said he will sleep! (Music Playing in TV) What Bobby, you look so excited? - Amar Sir? Yeah. I found out your problem. How did you plan the payment? How much black and how much white? Tell me the problem first Your behaviour changes all of a sudden You act like some other person for some time And again changing into another person. One says he likes Brave Heart and the other says he likes Inception. He says potato fry and this guy says Sandwich. One is drinking and one doesn’t - Why so? Because of drink - Is it? I’ll prove it. Take it Will my behaviour change if I drink? -You drink it and you’ll know it yourself. Yes, don’t get it down Nonstop... Bobby wishes hello to Akbar Sir Who’s Akbar? Oh! Good morning Doctor Doctor? You said I will change if i drink, but how come you are changing. One more minute, I’ll show Sridevi. (Song playing in TV) Come on, come on, come out What an amazing actress? Quite unfortunate! Many wrote these comments. Don’t you feel anything? I feel very sad Look Bobby, I know that something is happening to me. But, I need to know why that is happening. That God will know - You should be that God. You gave me such a big post? - I’ll give even such a big payment. You should get to know what my problem is and only I should know that... Payment is cut even when someone else gets to know that. To lose is easy but to earn is very tough. Very tough, very tough! Excuse me, FBI! Yes sir. We want to meet Dr. Antony Please come in. Are you Dr. Antony? Yes, I’m Dr. Antony - Then... Who’s he? Oh, he is Amar. A very nice guy How can you say? - If you allow to say... Doctor, Amar’s family went through great injustice and we’re investigating that. He’ll get justice if you cooperate. - Sure officer. How exactly do you know Amar? 14-15 years back, when I was in Detroit when I was jogging a day, two kids were sitting in pathetic situation. They seemed to be rich kids. They were the same even when I was returning after my jogging. Don’t worry Aishu, I’m here. Hi, who are you and what are you doing here? Are you waiting for someone? But, it isn’t safe for you to be here. Ok? Oh God, she’s having temperature and she needs a treatment. Come on, let’s go Hey, don’t you worry. I’m a Doctor. Hey Jack, two new kids for admission. I would give you the details later. Is the nursing staff there? Yes sir. -Ok, thank you. Who here thinks he’s strong? Not many? Who here thinks she’s strong? Good! Great! There’s nothing wrong in getting hurt. There’s nothing wrong in crying. But remember one thing! We’re all strong! Strong. Strong. Strong. While it was so, I saw a peculiar incident one day Asihu, let’s go. Come on - Come Aishu, let’s play... it's fun out side. Trust us. Trust us. Trust me! Trust me! Trust me! What did you say? Did you say trust me. Wait... wait... wait. After studying Aishwarya deeply, I understood that... She has a problem called Dissociative Identity Disorder That means? Curiosity Sir Split personality or they say it as multiple personality. Aishu... Amar from then used to take better care of Aishwarya One day, I saw another strange incident. Hi, how are you? That’s nice to hear that. Today, I’d like to ask you a question. Who here thinks he’s strong? Not many. Yes, we all are strong. Hello, this is Dr. Antony. I’m expecting someone later. I said I’ll call you back. Amar! What’s this? I’m not Amar, I’m Dr. Antony. Don’t disturb me. Ok, what does that mean? I then understood that even Amar has a dissociative Identity Disorder problem. When I analysed as to why even he has the same problem, I realised that it is love of Amar on Aishwarya Because of the strong reason to cure her, this problem got induced even to Amar. But, there’s a small difference in between these two Aishwarya used to suddenly behave violently And come back to normalcy very fast. But Amar used to adopt the characters. Like he adopted my character, he at times used to adopt the character of Akbar too. He used to stay back in these characters for some days at a stretch. I never understood when he would come into which character. Three characters in one person - It’s not rare It was found that a guy named Billy Milligan had 24 personalities in him. There were those whom he knew, read about, saw, heard and when Someone said something are all in those. This is a very famous case in the United States There would be some triggering points to shift into these characters Triggering points means? It may be a sound or a scene or a smell or can be a touch. There would be many reasons as such By the time I could tell Amar about the problem he has, An article came in a paper about our rehab and the charity I do. There were Amar and Aishwarya’s photos in that That same day, a patient was admitted in our rehab. We later understood that he wasn’t a patient but a killer. Aishu! Aishu! Aishu! -Stop. Who is done it? There... there, over there. So, Amar who went following that killer didn’t come back. Days passed and I felt very sad thinking that even Amar would have died in his hands. But after 14 years when I was in Europe, my assistant called me and said. She said Amar came to rehab and informed why he didn’t come back for so long. I came to know that he underwent punishment For these 14 years at Jackson Prison for killing that killer. He donated 1 Million Dollars to our rehab for the help We did to them in their childhood. Though I was anxious to come and see Amar, I couldn’t come because of my prior commitments. Unfortunate, my assistant called again And informed that Amar is again behaving like me. Amar left by the time I returned. I felt very happy seeing grown up Amar in CCTV footage. The pain for not telling Amar about the psychological issue he had till date from his childhood, still remains in me. You are Antony and who is Akbar, Doctor? I came to know that a person named Akbar came to rehab About two to three times asking for Amar. But I couldn’t meet him. Didn’t that Akbar coming there not ask anything about Aishwarya? They said that he just asked about Amar. Ok, can you please try to recollect? Did anything else happen on the day Aishwarya died? Yes, the boy staying in Aishwarya’s opposite room Ran away from rehab in a fear. Can you give me his details? Oh sorry, he’s an orphan and we don’t have details about him. Thank you Doctor, for your time and cooperation. I’ll see you soon. Pleasure is mine, any time Chidambaram - Sir. We’ll get total clarity if we find out who that Akbar is - Correct Sir How did the lamp post miss from here? It’s confirmed that it is Amar, who killed Vikram Talwar. But why did Vikram say that Akbar saved him. How did bomb blasts take place in Central park? Go and check there. The person who has to kill the target person has actually saved him. Fate is strange... it's difficult to understand that. Are you the great man whom I saw at WATA? Akbar? - Yes Akbar, why are you running? Kharge -Sir. Bomb blasts are happening in Central park Is it? I just met with an accident also. But luckily Akbar saved my life. Akbar whom you met in WATA? - Yes, same guy. Come fast. - Ok Sir. Why is this in my pocket? - What is that? Is it you doing all these Bomb Blasts? The person who escaped in the last minute has invited death again and died. Destiny is very strong... it is very difficult to escape from that. It's like a mystery. Sir, liquor is over at home. Sorry Sir Where did this Doctor disappear. Doctor! Doctor! Who is this heavy person next to him. Smiling Doctor! Doctor, Doctor! Doctor, Doctor! Does he too know? Will he ask for a share or what? Doctor Sir By chance is he Akbar? Does he know even that character? By chance, has he appointed even this fellow? It’s better I clarify in advance. Let me use him. He’s Jackson, Michael Jackson Is he a patient? No, he is Bobby. He is with me. Thank God, he’s the Doctor. He maybe a patient. Doctor, where did you go leaving behind Pooja’s treatment and my love? Who is Pooja? Doctor, the girl I loved and who hit me when you asked me to propose her. By the way, how do you know Pooja? I told you that I have met her at WATA, when I met you in the hospital. Being a Doctor, why so many questions like a patient forgetting it all? There wouldn’t be so many questions, if you give all details from start to finish. Ok Doctor, I’ll narrate you in detail. - please... Look there Do you have that WATA footage? You just heard it all, right Doctor? Being in finance dept. are we in a position to collect the footage? Ok, Pooja is an event Manager right? Would she have it? Possible. ok, can you get her tomorrow? Ok, I’ll get Pooja along with the footage. -Thanks. Amar will surely come, right uncle? He’ll definitely come dear. That God wouldn’t do more injustice than this to you Dear, Where is my Aishwarya..? Uncle. Uncle Aishu, my dear - Uncle. Oh God! Be quiet dear. Amar... Where is Amar? Uncle Hey Aishu, why are you going into that room? We all have the same room. Well, I like that one better It's my room now. Okay. -Get yourself out, now. Move fast. - That’s enough. Let’s search for Amar, come on Amar... Amar... Amar... Amar... Amar should come at least for Aishwarya. But he didn’t come means I doubt Amar died in the hands of that killer. My wish is that it shouldn’t be so. As per what Dr. Antony said Amar has a problem called Dissociative Identity Disorder. And thus he behaved like Antony. But who is this Akbar? Jalal Akbar - Who is that? Closest to the Fido family, like a family member. Now I got it. I understood who that person Akbar is, whom he is adopting. But, there is one more issue. Why did Jalal Akbar coming to rehab ask only for Amar? He didn’t ask at all about Aishwarya, why? Point number 2, who put the second bouquet that day in the graveyard? Looking at individually, both look like two different questions. But looking at both together, one answers the other. I suspect that Aishwarya is still alive. The man we sent burnt and killed Aishwarya. With that anger, Amar killed him and went to jail. Mr. Saboo Menon, I’m an FBI officer. That day, body burnt into ashes to such an extent that it was difficult to identify the body. A boy in the opposite room went missing. Now, I’m 100% sure that all this isn’t a coincidence. According to your information, 80% share holders are still alive. Find them immediately. Chidambaram - Sir Inform Intelligence department to trace out Jalal Akbar, immediately Ok Sir. We’re here. Watch your step Pooja. She isn’t any kid Sir. -She a kid for me He asked to prepare food and who knows it here? Hi bro -tell me Bro. Sir asked to bring, right? Pooja. What shall I do then? Is Doctor Sir in, bro? Doctor Sir? - Yes He hasn’t come from two days bro. I met yesterday itself, right? He’s different, right? - So, is he Akbar? No, he’s someone else What time would Doctor come? Doctor Sir comes not according to time but based on the situation. Can we wait? - Your patience. Don’t care about him, he’s a mad guy Cooking like a lady, huh! Pooja - Yes. Poor Doctor, what would happen If he has that food, right? True, what’s his name? Bobby. Mr. Bobby - Isn’t this good? You relax and I’ll cook. Bro, it gets septic if it pierces - This will become septic. Boss, you were just saying something that Doctor comes based on situation and not based on time. I didn’t understand. I shouldn’t tell in a manner you understand. No problem, please say how is that? - Hey, shut up They’ll become Doctors if they studying MBBS. How they become based on situations? Oh my God, it’s blood - Apply Turmeric, it’ll come down This is called becoming Doctor based on situation. What, so many items and so fast? See how’s the taste. Wow, lady finger is a wow like Bhimavaram Abhiruchi. Trust me. Sambar tastes like from Kakinada Subbaiah mess, trust me. Potato is a blast like from Chaudhary Mess, trust me. I said trust me right? Trust me Any lady would jump in joy when someone appreciates her cooking And why do you look so like a devil? Trust me, Trust me, Trust me... Trust me, Trust me, Trust me... I too had faced the same experience, Bro. It's extreamly painful. Come, let’s see her situation. Huh, why do I need about her situation? Not to hit again, come on let’s see - Oh no! Has anything happened to my Vertebra? Is she relaxing or recharging? No problem! - Oh no, what’s all this? That means, I again... Damn! What’s happening to me? Why am I behaving so badly? I should feel right? Why is she feeling? I’m so sorry Mr. Bobby. It’s ok - It’s ok madam, it happens. Oh, good morning Doctor - Good morning Hi Doctor Blue looks good on you - Oh Hi Pooja yeah. Did you get the footage? Sorry, I don’t have it and I came to say that in person. It’s ok Hey Bobby, what happened? The same thing that happened to me then, happened now to Bobby. Did you by chance misbehave? I behaved as it is. No idea what she felt? Some bad time Sir, let’s not drag about it. Pooja prepared lunch for you Sir. Enough! Mom, this is really great. Aishwarya prepared them. Thanks, I felt like I had food after so many years. I love this food, Especially cup cake. It reminded me of the people who went away from me. I learnt all these just for a special person I missed out. Those who went away from you will definitely come back. I don’t have that chance. All those... I’m sorry. Everyone says time has the power to heal any big wound. But few wounds won’t get healed till the heart stops. I wish you get back the person and happiness you missed. He promised me. He never broke his promise. That confidence is keeping me alive. Like a dream and story, where did you go away like that? I’m left behind as a statue like this, when will you be before me? Your thought will never be gone even in days or years. Your thought is starting every tomorrow like the day start. Wherever you are, however far you are, will you listen to me? Hey smile, come running, come to me like the childhood friend. Hey smile, come running, come to me like the childhood friend. There isn’t a place I haven’t searched for you. There isn’t the light without you. There isn’t a day I forgot about you The moment without you is hard For the eyes not seeing you and my dreams filled with tears I’m stepping ahead taking just your name. FIDO Group is expanding it's operations in Russia. To look after establishment works, Company COO and senator Mr.Saboo menon is going to Russia for two months. Senator Residence. There are three route options for Saboo Menon to go to the airport. Bobby, the place we’re going now is a very dangerous place. More than our house? There will be a tall and dark guy and he likes his mother a lot What’s the freshness in this? It’s quite natural Unnatural thing is that he has too much of inferiority complex. We shouldn’t give eye contact to such people. What happens if given? -You’ll know when given. What shop is this? - Toys shop So, its Baby’s day out. Why so much buildup for toys, Sir? You come inside. Oh no, you said toys shop and they’re selling drugs here. Don’t talk, they’ll kill you. Hi... Micheal. Are you Amar? Yeah. Johnson told me. What do you want, my man? I need some toys - Got it. Peter, take him down - Okay. Thanks. -Come. Bobby, you remember right? - Very much and I won’t look at all. Select which one. New arrivals. Can I? -Sure. What about this? - This is special one. Any how it syncs with gadgets. - Ok! Hey you, what’s your name? - Bobby That’s great. I love that name. My younger son is also Bobby. So, what shall I do? Many will have this name. Hey Bobby, my mom is talking to you. He says not to look and this guy says to look. Still, for this fellow at this age what are these games with toys like a kid wearing shorts? What, what did you say? - What did I say? You said Nigger and then you saw at us Hey, what did I say man? Why do you talk as you wish? Oh no... You called me Nigger. Boss, he is talking nonsense - Who? Amar Who’s Amar? Akbar! Oh no, Akbar came in and how to get out now? Why did you aim gun at him? You came for guns. Take the guns, pay the money and go. You said for toys, did we come to buy guns? Why do I need guns bro? Selling guns is a crime and I’ll give a Police complaint. Why do you say complaint when we’re at the gun point? Leave him, he’s a friend of Johnson. He told me, he has a problem, let him go. But keep him here, he’s a funny guy Stay calm madam, all this is because of you. Added to this you’re wearing a shorts up to your thighs. You told my mom, a nigger? I know him, a dangerous guy. You can kill him. Akbar Sir, we’ll settle if there’s anything amongst us at home. Please save me dude. Hey go, we both have nothing to do. Hey, Open the door. Akbar! I came thinking its Baby’s day out but this seems to be Bobby’s last day. Save me Akbar Who saves you.. Who. How dare you call my mom a Nigger. Don’t worry guys,there was a small mishap. Relax...Relax...Relax! Hey Micheal...Micheal, what’s happening man? He’s with me He called my mother Nigger I said knickers sir, they didn’t suit at all on his mother. Shut up Bobby. Micheal, its just a misunderstanding. Language problem, please leave him. I’m leaving him... because you say. Thank you I want my stuff - Are you sure this time? Sure Micheal...

Move your car immediately It’s not possible to move when you ask to move. I’ve a time and a target. Target fix! Hey, consequences will be very serious if you don’t move the car, I’m telling you. What’ll you do man? At most, you’ll fine me right? 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 or 5000? But you won’t kill me right? Sir... Oh my God! Hey, I only shot the Senator. I shot the Senator. I shot the Senator, I shot the Senator, I only shot the Senator. Hey, why did you kill the Senator? My target is this from one year. Though there are 30 in the team, entire credit goes to me What are you talking about? - About the game Kill the Senator, kiss the Secretary! Even this title I only kept. Entire credit goes to me. I’m talking about that murder This isn’t a game, This is a remote control synchronized with that gun. Gun? You hit with that and killed Senator. And moreover, you agreed to have done it all I’m saying this for the first time in my life. I don’t need any credit Sir. Leave me Sir, I’ll go back to my village. I miss my parents very badly.

Chitra, it’s a surprise that all those attending Senator’s murder case enquiry are Telugu people. Hi bro... Mr. Kandula, can you say why did they call you? It seems a hand is less inside for gambling What...? Sit down - I’ll sit Not that man, when you called for your work, you should send the vehicle right? He’s Mr. Kandula and I only told that name He needs medicines But looking at him, some relief For me also - You too? That means, you too enjoy when someone is being hit? I’ll cry if stopped. I think all are the same. They won’t say. Why did you make Senator’s car tire flat? It isn’t important whether it’s Senator’s car or the President’s car but what’s important is whether two sevens exist or not Double seven... North east tyre is this only. My lucky number is 7, see dear. See Why did you do that..? come on tell. -I’ll say sir, I’ll say Hey Kandula, bad time is running for you. -Oh no... Look for any car with two sevens And take of the air from its tyre on North East side. The think we got to observe is that he too is in white and blue. Why did they call you for enquiry Sir? Everyone in Telugu states know about history of our Gandikota. They may have called to know this even in United States Please tell me. How can I help you? Why did you put the crane blocking the road in 7th Avenue? Is that crane any property of your mother’s husband? That’s earned by me. Still, Government fined me and I’ve already paid that. Topic is over! See, how he is behaving not knowing the matter Brother, I told his name -He told your name. Senator died as the route got diverted Is it? In which graveyard are the final rites going to be conducted? He didn’t let go his manners, he and his graveyard, bloody Why did you plan for Senator’s murder? What is Senator and murder? What are you talking? You along with your friends Miryala and Kandula, planned Senator's murder... How can they be my friends? Cheap people! I’m from an esteemed family. His dad is a graveyard keeper Sir - He too looks the same Miryala, Kandual! What happened, man? You’ll experience now and you’ll then know Why did you keep the crane blocking the road? For his bad luck - To cover the bad sight of Sukrudu (Jupitor Planet.) Sukh!(Jupitor) Yes - Who is he? Not a person Sir, it’s a planet. Will you cover a planet with a crane? -It’s just the eyes Oh no... Oh no... Oh God! Why, why did you do this? -I’ll say, I’ll say sir Sukrudu (Jupitor Planet) is looking with a slant look. Some construction of yours is happening in 4th Avenue, right? Yes. Look for the correct corner and place your crane blocking the road. Chitra, peace messenger Junior Paul is also coming for the enquiry Even he is following white and blue uniform. Sir, can you tell why they called you? Great one! Many call us for our blessings, they make me do prayers and cleanse their sins. God created every particle in the Universe. My heart feels even they called me for the same. Kandula, why talk about my dynasty infront of outsiders... Shut up rascal, false prestige isn’t gone even after so much happened Are we waste fellows ? - I mean, I didn’t think you were here. When you’re in search of peace, even happiness will be found May ghost bless you! Paul! May God bless you! Why’ve you done this? What do you mean by this work ? Are they the marriages I got done for widows? Support I’ve provided for the orphans? Getting small kids educated or to give shelter to the old people? Planning the Senator’s murder - Paula! Paula! What do you mean by saying I planned the murder, you devil eyed rascal? Why do you look so, rascal? I’m the one doing prayers across 148 nations for Presidents and Prime Ministers. I’ll curse and kill you, dirty rascal. This Paul’s skin will be peeled. He would become very fair. Tell me. See his potentiality Even his dad was the same, never used to shake at all. No... Paul Sir! Who are you? Why did you come from India? To do black magic Sir What? - Black Magic Sir. Black magic to kill whom? Is it the Senator? Is it Senator? Come on sir, will there any black magic these days? If yes, will PM and Trump be there? Will you be here? Is black magic not there? No, you fools. Then Pulla Reddy? - He won’t die, you idiots That means, they planned another murder Sir. You waste fellow, don’t talk with half knowledge. I’m just an artist and the main man behind all this is different. Who is he? Akbar, that man Hail my Lord! Look Darkha I don’t need to know whether you have powers or not. They’re following you. If you follow what I say, I’ll give you 50000 Dollars. Here is the advance. We shouldn’t delay when a good chance comes in Good luck - Ok Chidambaram - Sir He is relaxing like a pig. Darkha Sir - What still Darkha Sir? What Darkha idiot, there isn’t any black magic? - No dude. Then how did the tree turn black? I poured acid - Acid, you poured acid idiot? Chidambaram - Sir. He used all these buffoons very cleverly. In order to not have any obstacles for his problem, he planned backup for the hiccup. He’s a genius. He used these to kill the Senator. I’ll use these to catch that guy now. Why are the Police coming again dude? You understood what he is, right? Understood very well Sir. Good. Within 24 hours, you should catch him and handover to us If not, you know the power of FBI and how strict is the law here, right? You all will be hanged. Amar! Amar! Amar... Open the door. Doctor, hi! Hello, how are you? I was thinking to call you - I see. My friend is giving a grand party and I would really like it, if you could come. Sure, relax! - Is it? Miryala, as per what you said that Doctor looks the same as Akbar, right? Yes, both look alike but characters are entirely different What Bobby? - I see He doesn’t know at all how Akbar looks, right? You got to know too much dude I got an excellent idea. As we cannot catch Akbar by any means, if we catch this Doctor and hand him over to that officer, we can escape. Idea is great Kandula, I appreciate you. Hey, message from Pooja Today evening there’s a costume presentation party, I invite you to attend and Dr. Antony sir is also coming Hey Gandikota - Respect. Hey, get lost. We won’t get a better opportunity than this to catch that Doctor. Oh my God of the Lord of the rings, For my love to be a success, I should somehow save Dr. Antony. That’s it! I’m stuck and for my money to come, I should make Amar Sir escape. I don’t need even if he dies later. Enjoy openly and chill Hey dear, why confusions? Right or wrong, you enjoy now Mix wine with brain Search for brakes to time Why the past things, let go It’s a danger if matter worsens When drowned in trance, won’t nature swallow the future? Stop the revolving globe Throw the solid Dollar Smile and let go mistakes and confusions. Don’t say avenge or the revenge. Life is just one, live it. Don’t say love or risk Take it easy, idiot Love is like Tooty Fruity and there’s a beauty for sure. Like the moon landing in your hands. What’s the difference between you and me, keep aside all the warnings We shall enjoy like some devil is over us Let go all confusing questions Enjoy the peg riding over the head Don’t say anyone to stop Look around for all types Come sir. We risked our lives to catch him. We’ll go if you can give the suitable reward Where’s he? Here we go I’m not interested What’s this? Some mistake took place somewhere Sir We covered cloth on this dirty fellow in that darkness mistaking for his boss. Who is the Boss? The guy you need Do you have the number of your boss? Oh no, looks like Doctor Sir will be booked How will he have his phone number? If not him will you have his Boss’s phone number? Give your phone. I won’t use a phone Sir Password - Face ID Don’t say that I gave it, Sir. For your whereabouts to come from Intelligence Department, it got a bit delayed. After both your friends Died, I thought even you would have escaped. But I came to know the reason for you to be right here is that Aishwarys is still alive. Kharge, its no more a doubt. It’s confirmed. Aishwarya is alive. Proof for that is the fear seen in his eyes. When the first one died, I thought the sins got ripened. When the second one died, I thought sins are hunting. When even the third one died, I fell in the thought whether it is the sin or the revenge I now understood that revenge is hunting. It’s confirmed, Amar is alive Proof for that is the fear seen in you. The revenge Amar postponed in childhood, he is taking it now. You don’t need to pray any God, because God is behind Amar. I don’t have the habit of praying to God. If you say where is Aishwarya is, I’ll leave you alive When my friends helped, you took their lives For the help they did to me, I’ll happily give away my life. But, I’ll never say where Aishwarya is. What I need is not your answer, but your finger print First name, Aishu baby! Kharge! Hello uncle Your uncle met with an accident. What happened? Where is he now? He’s out of danger now. If you say where you are and which color dress you are in, My people will come and pick you up. Hello. I heard the voice of the guy who is wishing to kill me. I wish to see. Karan Arora! When someone asks me what’s the happiest moment of your life, I don’t know what you used to say. but you would say only what I’m saying now from today. I’m sure. Aishwarya is alive. And one more good news to you. Even your Jalal uncle is with us. You can see both, if you come Where? 99...7.5... Shakelton. Kharge, I’ll torture him and kill Aishwarya in front of his eyes Don’t have any programs like killing them in front of their eyes and vice versa Sir. He’s very dangerous and a Jackson prisoner As and when he comes, shoot him down first Girl anyways is in our hands. If you have any sadism from your end, try it there Sir. No Kharge, I should show him what pain is Arora, thanks for being fit. Why because....there’s a chance to live many years with this fitness. Being such a fit guy, I’m killing you. You escaped from my hands as a kid and you’re now dying in my hands. It’s all destiny I too believe in destiny. It wasn’t me who escaped then, but your death. He didn't listen when I told him to shoot as soon as he comes. He isn’t understanding even when his people are in danger. I can’t understand where this situation graph would lead. Shoot him, Sir I say shoot him right away Please leave me. Give the Fido ring. Give me back Leave me, please leave me. Tell me one reason, I’ll leave you Should I leave you for killing my parents? Should I leave for you turning our Paradise into a graveyard? Should I leave you for mentally torturing my Aishwarya, why should I leave you? You should leave me as your Aishwarya is in my hands. Should I leave you for still blackmailing me? Chidambaram, Aishwarya is right here, but why did he behave like that? I’m not Aishwarya, I’m Nancy. That means you cheated me, you... No! Why did she hit with the leg not even caring that you’re an FBI officer Sir? Will she hit with hand if not with the leg, you idiot? How did this dirty Nancy come in to Aishwarya’s place? Nancy, where are you? Thank God, go to 9/11 memorial immediately And please wear Blue Jeans and White shirt. Make it fast Nancy... I will be in touch with you. Aishu in trouble. Okay. Hi, are you Aishwarya? - Yes Please come with us. Please... Damn! It somehow happened, say what next, Sir I killed that Journalist Robert for Rajveer. All died without giving me the payment promised. Reason for all this is that Amar. I’ll see how he would escape from all the murders he committed. Aishu Birthday. Hey, Aishu what are you doing..? Today is your birthday right... so planting this for you. Thankyou Aishu. Doctor! Sorry, I’m not the Doctor, but Amar This place is ours. Amar! Pooja, what happened? I’m not Pooja Aishwarya! Aishu Your Aishu! Lucky. They both have come together now And the psychological issue they have will slowly fade away. Life's value won't go down just for one defeat. Similarly just one victory can't dictate for hundred years. Policy to think tomorrow is mine is better than the philosophy that there's no tomorrow. The path to reach our destination not visible even by lifting the head and seen, is below our feet. Not with tiredness, but let's step ahead with hope. If possible, till the end. Your honor, Amar isn’t a criminal. He is a patient suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder. Your honor, if one has this problem the original guy doesn’t know as to what he’s doing Or what he’s thinking while behaving like the other person. He murdered them all, when he wasn’t himself but somebody else. The court acquits Amar from all the charges. Why did you give witness in his favor, Sir? I killed that Journalist Robert for Rajveer. I thought this blackmailing trend is only in Telugu states, But it has even spread to United States. Hearty welcome to WATA committee new chairman Mr. Chetan Sharma. Hello... Sir.
