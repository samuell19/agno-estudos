[music playing] MAN (ON RADIO): Police were called to the home in a report of a kidnapping. Investigators were following through with demands and a ransom note when the family member found the body. CINDY MARRA: My dad worked on over 200 homicide cases. He never lost a case. He wanted to get justice for those victims. 9-1-1 OPERATOR: 9-1-1 Emergency. PATSY RAMSEY: There's a ransom note here. PATSY RAMSEY: Oh my god. CINDY MARRA: While my dad was working on the Ramsey case, he kept an audio diary. CINDY MARRA: It's unique. Nobody has heard this outside the family. CINDY MARRA: The public thinks that they know what happened, but this allows the public to have a ringside seat to what was going on. CINDY MARRA: We're releasing the recordings now because we want to find the killer of JonBenet. We believe he's still out there. Like my dad would say, it's time to stir the pot. CINDY MARRA: He wanted nothing more than to find who did this to her. [music playing] [MUSIC - MATT HIRT AND MARC FERRARI AND STEVE MARK COLLOM, "FOLLOW MY LORD"] (SINGING) I'll still follow my Lord. Yes, I still follow my Lord. MAN (ON RADIO): [inaudible] This is the best station in the city. Don't touch that dial. We got music from morning, noon till-- [radio static] We are looking to do justice in this case. Everyone knew by then that the police were very focused on the family, just through the media. REPORTER: Questions about the Ramsey's mounted every day. Meanwhile, investigators-- CINDY MARRA: So when my dad came in, he just figured it was a matter of determining who it was in the family that did it. MAN (ON RADIO): A six-year-old was discovered in the family's basement by her father. The parents are suspected in the crime, but they maintain their innocence. [music playing] My name is Paula Woodward. I'm an investigative reporter and an author. I reported on the JonBenet Ramsey case from the beginning. Is your investigation focusing inside the Ramsey family or outside the Ramsey family as far as suspects? This was initially a kidnapping. A 2 and 1/2 page ransom note was left in the house. The ransom note writer said, hey, I'll call you between 8:00 and 10:00 AM. There was never any phone call. John Ramsey was asked to search the house, and he finds his daughter's body. PAGEANT ANNOUNCER: Our next contestant is JonBenet Ramsey. [applause] [music playing] It was known almost immediately-- I would say within a day-- that she was a child beauty queen. REPORTER: Some media outlets and the police focused on these sensational aspects of the case. PAULA WOODWARD: Pageant photographers would sell their pictures and their video to the networks. The story just took off. Within a week of her death, it was an international story. REPORTER: There is tremendous public pressure to find Little Miss Colorado's killer. Reporters from all-- --little girl named JonBenet Ramsey. JonBenet's murder-- JonBenet Ramsey-- District attorney Alex Hunter has asked us to announce another member of the expert prosecution task force. Lou Smit has been added as a investigator. I'm Lou Smit. I'm the investigator that's going to be working the Ramsey case. CINDY MARRA: My dad was called out of retirement to join the investigation of the Ramsey case. REPORTER: Boulder is burdened with an intense murder investigation that has now reached-- PAULA WOODWARD: Lou Smit was hired because of the huge disagreement between Boulder Police and the Boulder District Attorney's Office on whether or not there was enough evidence to try and convict John and Patsy Ramsey. His job was to work for the DA's office. Any of the information that they got in from the Boulder PD, they had asked him to review it, give his opinion on what that evidence was showing. One of the things that made Lou Smit so unique was he was not just a homicide detective. He had over 20 years with the Coral Springs Police Department, but then he went to work for the coroner's office. So he knew the legal medical side. And then, he was investigator for the district attorney's office. Lou was involved in over 200 homicide cases, and he never lost one case in court. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: When Lou looked at a case, he would look at the physical evidence, the motive, and the character. And so when you look at the JonBenet Ramsey case, why would a mom and dad kill their daughter on Christmas night? [music - "deck the halls"] Hello, I'm Patsy Ramsey. This is JonBenet. She's 4. Burke is 7. And we'd like to welcome to our home and wish you a very Merry Christmas. [MUSIC - "WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS"] The Ramseys had a lot of money. They lived in a beautiful home in Boulder. A week or so before Christmas, an article had been published about John Ramsey's company and that it had had a billion dollars in sales. They would be logical targets of a kidnapper. Merry Christmas and the happiest of New Years. PAULA WOODWARD: Except the ransom note was written on one of Patsy Ramsey's notepads. Boulder Police thought the ransom note was part of a cover-up by John and Patsy Ramsey to deflect attention away from their murder of their daughter. [music playing] PAULA WOODWARD: It wasn't computing with him that the Ramseys did this, that they staged this murder. [music playing] MAN (ON RADIO): A nightmare was coming true-- a beautiful young girl murdered the day after Christmas. Questions are now being raised about whether her parents could have been involved. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: The very first thing is to secure and contain the crime scene. But instead, what happens is that the family is actually allowed to stay in the home and call their friends to come over to the home to provide comfort. PAULA WOODWARD: There were 18 people in the house. The crime scene didn't have a chance. PAULA WOODWARD: They left one lone detective on the scene to handle 18 people. My name is John Ramsey. I'm JonBenet's father. The one woman detective was there, said, why don't you and your friend go through the house. See if you see anything out of the ordinary. [music playing] As I was going through the basement, I opened the-- we call it the wine cellar, but it was an old coal room, and I found JonBenet. [music playing] There was a rush of relief, obviously. I found my child, thank God. She had tape over the mouth, and her wrists were tied above her head. I immediately took the tape off her mouth, and I tried to untie the-- her wrists, and it was too tight. I couldn't get it untied. So I scooped her up and screamed. And just-- I just wanted to-- I don't know, just a panic scream. I want to help. How do I help my daughter? I took her upstairs and laid her down, and the detective checked and said, no, she's gone. [music playing] If they had opened the door, they would have found her body and any evidence would have been forensically sterile because nobody had been in that room since probably the killer. When her body had been found, one of the Boulder officers said, I knew it. They killed their daughter. They decided John and Patsy were guilty within minutes. REPORTER: John and Patsy Ramsey buried JonBenet in their home city of Atlanta, but where the Ramseys went, the police followed. PAULA WOODWARD: Of course they were suspects. They were in the house. They were related to her. But that didn't mean they were guilty. REPORTER: They have only just buried their daughter, but most people appear to believe that John and Patsy Ramsey had something to do with the murder. Pray with us. Pray for our child. PAULA WOODWARD: What we learned from the autopsy report was that JonBenet died from strangulation and a blow to the head. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: Boulder Police Department started to formulate a theory as to what they believe happened inside of the home. PAULA WOODWARD: One of the things that came out from the investigation is that JonBenet was a bedwetter. One of the theories was she wet the bed that night, Patsy became enraged and slammed her head against something, and that either Patsy or John staged the strangulation to cover up for what they had done. PAULA WOODWARD: Lou Smit found fibers from her night clothing on those sheets, which indicated that they had not been washed or cleaned since then. So therefore, she had not wet the bed. The Ramseys had no criminal record. The child beauty pageant, the pictures, and the video became the criminal record they did not have. Child beauty pageants were really frowned upon. Here are children who are being sexualized like Las Vegas showgirls, being taught how to be coquettish. This is not a good thing to do to children. PAULA WOODWARD: There were wanted posters with John Ramsey's picture being circulated throughout Boulder. That gives you an idea of really how savage the reaction was to them. This was the taint. I didn't like her being portrayed that way because that's very one dimensional. These are pictures of JonBenet. This is JonBenet when she went off to kindergarten. She was just a neat kid, and she and Burke would run for the elevator, see who could push the button first to go up or down. So we said, OK, wait, let's have a rule. One of you pick one button, and the other pick the other. And JonBenet says, well, I'm the up girl. Boy, that's the truth. JOHN ANDREW RAMSEY: We were a normal family. JonBenet was a normal kid. My name's John Andrew Ramsey, JonBenet's oldest brother. The JonBenet that I knew was a six-year-old kid that liked to ride a bike and play with her older brother Burke and his buddies. JOHN RAMSEY: JonBenet was very much an extrovert. She loved to perform. She didn't get it from me, so she got that from her mother. Patsy came from a small town in West Virginia and participated in those kind of pageants, went on to be Miss West Virginia, went to the Miss America pageant. She was portrayed as a pageant mom who dragged her child into those pageants and forced her to perform. Nothing could have been further from the truth. JonBenet loved it. It was the other way around. JonBenet was dragging Patsy to these things. PAGEANT ANNOUNCER: --JonBenet Ramsey, and she'll be doing "Rock Around the Christmas Tree." JOHN RAMSEY: One of my treasured memories was JonBenet-- and this was just before she was murdered-- was performing in a little pageant. And I had always told her, talents what count. Don't worry about whether you're the prettiest or have the prettiest smile. JONBENET RAMESEY: (SINGING) Rocking around the Christmas tree-- JOHN RAMSEY: I said, it's the only thing that matters. You just work on your talent. I was late, and she'd already performed and then had the talent competition. And she came running up to me and said, dad, I won this for you. And it was the overall talent award. And she put it around my neck. REPORTER 11: Crime scene investigators are still combing through the home. Police haven't named any suspects. But curiously, they are saying that the public at large is not in any danger, that there is not a random killer on the loose. The evidence points to someone inside the house rather than outside the house. JOHN ANDERSON: Lou was pointing out right from the very beginning that, look, you have evidence of an intruder that's being overlooked. He says, Johnny, there's some things in this case that aren't adding up. There's something wrong here. There's something amiss. The story that's being told is not factual. [music playing] REPORTER: The probe into the murder of six-year-old beauty pageant star JonBenet Ramsey seemed stalled two weeks after her death. REPORTER: Police say that they've narrowed the list of suspects, but they are not close to naming a suspect at this time. CINDY MARRA: There were no visible signs of forced entry into the home. CINDY MARRA: When my dad first started reviewing the photos, something really jumped out at him. The information on this case at that point was that there was no forced entry into the house, and therefore it had to be somebody inside the house that killed JonBenet. CINDY MARRA: Things started jumping out at my dad that started leading him down a different path. CINDY MARRA: I remember a week or two into the investigation, I called my dad. And I just said, so who did it, the mom or the dad? And he said, you know, I don't think it was either of them. And I was really surprised because that's all we were talking about. Everybody was talking about it was the parents. That's all there was to it. CINDY MARRA: My dad theorized that the intruder was going to kidnap JonBenet, and that was the reason he wrote the ransom note. The Boulder Police Department said that there's no way that somebody made their way in through that window. And so what Lou did was-- you know, he's one of those guys, he doesn't let go of things. He's an alligator, right? He actually showed how easily it would have been for somebody to open up the grate, get inside of that window well, climb in through the window, and get into the basement. He also showed how easy it would be to step on a suitcase and exit out of that area without, really, any problem. When Lou Smit disproved the Boulder Police Department theory, they called that his theatrics. REPORTER: Questions were raised about whether Patsy Ramsey was the author of the mysterious ransom note. REPORTER: So far, they have refused a formal police interview. REPORTER: Nobody has been ruled in or out as suspects. Leaks by the case detectives started immediately. Part of the misleading information included that the Ramseys were not cooperative. JOHN RAMSEY: We'd done a number of interviews with the police. We were totally eager to help. PAULA WOODWARD: It was leaked that Patsy Ramsey had not given DNA. Not true. JOHN RAMSEY: We gave them hair samples. We gave them pubic hair samples. We didn't refuse anything. PAULA WOODWARD: One of the things that was perpetually leaked was that Patsy's handwriting matched that of the note. JOHN RAMSEY: We did handwriting samples. We had to rewrite that horrible note time and time again. PAULA WOODWARD: There were several eminent handwriting experts who examined Patsy Ramsey's handwriting. There's a scale that says if it's 5 points, then you're not the writer. Patsy averaged between 4 and 4.5. So the indications were very, very strong that she was not the writer, yet the information continued to leak. JOHN RAMSEY: One of the leaks was that they were searching our home for child pornography. That made headlines, big headlines. The impression-- boom. Ah, what does that mean? PAULA WOODWARD: They didn't follow up and say, we didn't find anything. The inference was the Ramseys are guilty, and they were abusing JonBenet. JOHN RAMSEY: It was meant to incriminate us in the court of public opinion. [music playing] JOHN ANDERSON: Lou Smit had remarkable experience in solving cold cases. He saw things that I think other people just overlooked. REPORTER: In September of 1991, a 13-year-old girl mysteriously vanished one night. The Heather Dawn Church case had some similarities to the JonBenet Ramsey case because it involved a young girl kidnapped out of her home. JOHN ANDERSON: It was a very violent murder. REPORTER: The search for Heather lasted two years until her skull but no other remains were found off Rampart Range Road. The case was four years old, and it had gone cold. There was a lot of speculation that perhaps it was a parental abduction. The parents were going through a messy divorce at the time. This is it right here. Yeah, that's the window. They took some beautiful prints off of that. MARK SMIT: My dad came across a fingerprint that was found on a window screen. Then we got two hits, two hits on the prints, and both same guy. And that fingerprint eventually led them to the killer. Boy, that was something that day that we caught him. We must have had 50 cars all lined up there. JOHN ANDERSON: What Lou was able to do in less than four months was to have a suspect identified, in custody, and pleading guilty in court. I feel blessed as a sheriff to have the talent that we have here to my right. I'm happy for them that we found out who did this. KEVIN MACKEY: Can the man who found Heather's killer find JonBenet? Kevin Mackey, Eyewitness News. REPORTER: JonBenet grave has seen a steady flow of visitors paying their last respects and wondering about the secret that may be buried with her-- the identity of her killer. The most valuable evidence left behind by the killer was JonBenet's body. If investigators continued to look, there were still things that she was willing to tell. CINDY MARRA: When my dad examined the autopsy findings, he saw something different than the police did. [music playing] CINDY MARRA: It's a torture device. It's a very vicious and calculated way to either control or to kill somebody. The person who did this was doing it for some kind of a perverted pleasure. MARK SMIT: He had experience with all kinds of killers from crimes of passion to serial killers, and he just couldn't believe that a parent could do that to their child. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: If that's significant blow to her head had happened first, she would not have been able to respond when that garrote was placed around her neck because she would have been killed by that blow to her head, and Lou knew that. So Boulder's theory of the blow to the head happening first could not have happened. [music playing] This was a willful act of another human being, just incomprehendible. [music playing] For a long time, I blacked out portions and thought to myself that, well, maybe JonBenet was killed fast, she died fast. But the facts of the case and the reality of the situation is she was tortured and that it wasn't instant. It was drawn out and painful for her. JOHN RAMSEY: Someone asked me what would you say to JonBenet now if you could talk to her? And I would tell her, I'm sorry I didn't protect you. That's my job as a dad. [music playing] [music playing] JOHN RAMSEY: We had heard that Lou Smit would park in front of our house every morning on his way to work and say a prayer. And we wanted to meet Lou. And so we went to the house, and we introduced ourselves, and got in hi big old van, and just said, we're grateful that you're working on this case. Lou said, let's say a short prayer. It was a very warm, comforting feeling. You know, we were desperate for that kind of compassion, and I just felt that from Lou. He was caring. He cared. Lou was very harshly criticized by the police for talking to us. He was widely criticized for that. PAULA WOODWARD: Initially, boulder police really liked him because, initially, he thought the Ramseys were guilty. But when Lou Smit decided there was an intruder, he became a pariah, and Boulder Police hated him. They wanted the best from Lou Smit. But when he didn't fall in line with them, they drove him out. REPORTER: The Colorado Bureau of Investigations has completed DNA tests on material found at the crime scene. The materials have now been sent to the Cellmark Laboratory in Maryland for further examination. [music playing] CINDY MARRA: A couple of days after the murder, the police had taken DNA samples and sent them in to be tested. And the report of those tests were available approximately January 15. When the police got those results, they did commission another test. And even though the results were made available to the Boulder PD in May, those results weren't provided to the DA's office until July. Why would they want to withhold that information from the district attorney's office? The Boulder Police Department is not able to eliminate anyone as a suspect. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: They had already made up their minds that the Ramseys did it. They do remain under an umbrella of suspicion. They didn't want to share. It blew a hole in their theory. CINDY MARRA: Those test results showed the same thing. Foreign DNA was found under JonBenet's fingernails and in her panties. CINDY MARRA: To my dad, you add that to all of the other evidence that he was uncovering, and, again, it's just shining a light down that intruder path. CINDY MARRA: You can't discount it just because you don't like it and it doesn't fit your theory. You can't work a case that way. You've got to follow the evidence, and that's what he was doing. I [inaudible] district attorney's office. MAN: All right. - [inaudible] JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: Lou Smit was one of these guys that can't let go. He's going to keep going and keep pursuing the truth. He would go after anything and everything that was tied to a particular case. CINDY MARRA: One of the questions was, how would the parents not hear somebody taking their daughter from her bedroom? Wouldn't she wake up? Wouldn't she scream? Wouldn't there be some kind of a disturbance? CINDY MARRA: He was puzzling over that. And at about the same time, he was looking at the autopsy photos, and he sees these marks. CINDY MARRA: My dad put those two photos together. You realize that the two marks on each part of her body were the same distance apart. And he thought, that's got to mean something. That's when the light bulb kind of went off that this was a stun gun. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: In true Lou Smit form, he went and found somebody who actually worked a death of a stun gun, Dr. Michael Doberson. CINDY MARRA: My dad did a lot of research on stun guns, and he was able to find a stun gun and air taser that left the same distance between those two points where the electrodes contact the skin were just the same as the marks on JonBenet's body. CINDY MARRA: It was a huge breakthrough. It solved the puzzle about how JonBenet was taken into that basement without waking up or without alerting somebody in the house. But as soon as my dad brought forth the evidence that these were stun gun marks, the police got their own experts to develop that lead. REPORTER: JonBenet's parents remain the prime suspects in the investigation. A full year has now passed with plenty of clues but still no arrests in the murder of JonBenet Ramsey. On the anniversary of the Christmas killing, there was a candlelight vigil in Boulder, Colorado. CINDY MARRA: My dad surmised that there was a plan to kidnap JonBenet that night and that something went wrong with that plan. The police argument was that it's just silly to think that somebody was able to break in, wander around the house while the parents are asleep, take the daughter, stun gun her, try and get her out the window. There's no way that they wouldn't have woken up. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: He goes out to the Ramsey house, and he's in the basement. And as he's looking, he sees a furnace. He actually sees a pipe that is actually open on the end in the house and his remains open to the exterior of the home. It's another one of those a-ha moments. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: What Lou really wanted to find out was could the parents have heard was screaming three levels below them? This home is a 6,700 square feet Tudor. It has multiple levels. You have the basement level. You have the main level. You have the second story level, which is where JonBenet and her brother Burke had bedrooms. And then there's a level above that, which was entirely the master bedroom. So he hired an audiologist, and he had people in the master bedroom on the third floor. And he had people across the street. And he conducted the test. And guess what? They could not hear screaming on the master level floor. But if you went across the street, you could hear it perfectly. CINDY MARRA: Whether the kidnapper tried to put her in the suitcase and couldn't get out, whether she woke up during that time and screamed, we don't know. But something went wrong with that plan, and my dad theorized that that's when the kidnapper decided that he was going to do what he did. CINDY MARRA: The clank of metal on cement is very consistent with this guy going out the window. CINDY MARRA: In May of 1998, my dad and the others in the district attorney's office put together a presentation to show to Boulder PD about their evidence to show that an intruder was in that house that day. CINDY MARRA: The PD's reaction to it was that it was just a bunch of baloney. CINDY MARRA: They had reached an impasse. The Boulder PD had their theory, and the DA's office had their theory, or at least my dad and a few others in the DA's office. And in the meantime, the Ramsey family were offering to come in for further interviews. Nothing was being done to find the killer. And so I just felt compelled to write the district attorney and say, look, let's cut through this stuff. Dear, Mr. Hunter, we will meet any time, anywhere, for as long as you want with investigators from your office. I'm living my life for two purposes now-- to find the killer of JonBenet and to bring it to the maximum justice our society can impose. While there is a rage within me that says give me a few moments alone with this creature and there won't be any need for a trial, I would have succumbed to the behavior which the killer did. It's time to get down to the most important mission-- finding JonBenet's killer. That's all we care about. Sincerely, John Ramsey. [music playing] Arrangements were made to interview the Ramseys over a three-day period. OK, we're not-- we're live, so-- OK. [inaudible] We're live [inaudible]. [inaudible] today is Wednesday, June 24, 1998. CINDY MARRA: John and Patsy were to be questioned separately-- Mr. Ramsey-- CINDY MARRA: --but at the same time so that they couldn't confer with each other. They wanted it to be an interrogation. They wanted to have the pressure on the Ramseys. CINDY MARRA: Pressure, pressure, pressure, that's how they wanted to handle those interviews to hopefully get them to crack. CINDY MARRA: It was decided that my dad would interview or interrogate John Ramsey. JOHN RAMSEY: They were accusing her of murdering a child. And as a protective mother, she was angry. She wasn't going to stand for. The cops apparently interpreted that as, well, she's a tough woman and therefore capable of, you know, murdering her child. Nonsense. She kept hoping that they had some level of discernment to say, OK, these people are not what we think they are, but it just wasn't there. CINDY MARRA: My dad and his team at the DA's office remain convinced that an intruder was present, and Boulder PD remained entrenched in their theory that it was the Ramseys. Those interviews had done nothing to resolve that impasse. And shortly after that, the Boulder PD detective, Steve Thomas, resigned from the case. REPORTER 21: A former detective in the JonBenet Ramsey murder case wrote a blistering letter of resignation. Thomas said his primary reason for leaving his job is the belief the district attorney's office continues to mishandle the Ramsey case. MARK SMIT: His resignation was pretty explosive, very public, and that got the gears turning for what was going to happen in the case. [music playing] It's been almost two years now since JonBenet Ramsey was found murdered. And despite thousands of hours of investigation, no arrests have been made, but the case is heating up again. The turmoil surrounding this case had never abated. Nothing was being resolved. This is a very large case. It's going to be a very great burden to any particular office. In August of 1998, the governor of Colorado had had enough. You should know that this case is on track for a grand jury. PAULA WOODWARD: So he called the Boulder DA into his office. And he said, look, there's going to be a grand jury. In essence, what happened was three new prosecutors came in selected by the Colorado governor. And so there was going to be this big shift. REPORTER: Sources close to the case say the three new prosecutors now support the police's theory that JonBenet's parents were implicated in the murder or cover up. My dad started seeing people who supported his intruder theory being phased out of the investigation. REPORTER: Under the media spotlight today, 12 members of the public became the new jury in the extraordinary Ramsey murder case. I felt like the district attorney had just punted the football out of his possession and up to a grand jury. PAULA WOODWARD: What was ultimately going to be determined by this grand jury was, is there enough evidence to take John and Patsy Ramsey to trial? REPORTER: With the media circus tailing them, the 12 Boulder County residents who make up the JonBenet Ramsey grand jury arrived early morning to do their civic duty. MARK SMIT: What really drove him was just a commitment to the victims. Up to that point in his career, his chain of command had really let him represent his victims the way he saw necessary. But he said, if that ever changes, if the people above me ever get between me and what's right for the victim, that's the day I'll quit my job. That day came with the Ramsey case. He wrestled with his decision to resign from the case because, once he did that, he was going to be outside the case. He wouldn't have the information anymore. But he felt that he could do more for JonBenet by just investigating the case on his own. REPORTER: The grand jury investigating the death of JonBenet Ramsey is hearing secret testimony amidst a storm of controversy. A top investigator in the district attorney's office resigned, saying the district attorney is unfairly targeting the murder victim's parents. Lou Smit writes, John and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter. JOHN RAMSEY: He was probably the main guy that had a clear, unbiased opinion of the case and had the skill set to solve it, so we hated to see him resign. REPORTER: In the wake of Smit's resignation, the grand jury continued to hear from Boulder Police and forensic experts from the Colorado-- CINDY MARRA: My dad started making a presentation of the evidence in this case that he hoped to present to the grand jury, and he was denied. CINDY MARRA: They were alleging that he had information that he wasn't supposed to have, and he had an injunction filed against him. What they wanted my dad to do is turn over everything that he had so that they could destroy it. CINDY MARRA: And he couldn't allow that to happen. I'm Greg Walta. I've been a trial lawyer in Colorado for 50 years. Lou consulted me and showed me the presentation, and I thought it was extremely persuasive. So that evidence was going to get to the grand jury one way or the other. We then filed a motion stating that the grand jury was entitled to hear all the evidence. REPORTER: Boulder DA Alex Hunter says the grand jury is making progress. But with forensic and investigative police work still underway, the grand jury's job isn't finished either. GREG WALTA: The district attorneys pretty quickly realized they were not going to win that motion, and they made an agreement to have Smit testify to allow him to keep his evidence. GREG WALTA: It was great relief because he was willing to go to jail if he wasn't allowed to testify. CINDY MARRA: But my dad felt that the prosecution was trying to dismantle his case as he presented it. REPORTER: You might call it the calm before the storm. Media anticipation is running high, as television networks are staking out their coverage spots. CINDY MARRA: He had only been given three hours of the grand jury's time, whereas the prosecution had months, so he was resigned to the fact that the Ramseys were going to get indicted. He fully expected that to happen. REPORTER: The grand jury met twice, and prosecutors have left him alone several times, prompting speculation they are reviewing evidence and may even be close to a decision. The grand jury process about to make his statement as he heads towards a podium position. JOHN RAMSEY: We had a guardian paper drawn up for Burke. Our attorneys were with us. They were going to escort us to the jail to turn ourselves in. I want to thank you for all joining us on such short notice. What we now know is that the grand jury voted to indict both Patsy and John for child abuse resulting in death and accessory to a crime. ALEX HUNTER: And before I begin my very brief remarks-- PAULA WOODWARD: So what happened next came as a surprise to a lot of people. ALEX HUNTER: --all of us today and outlined some things [inaudible]. The Boulder grand jury has completed its work and will not return. No charges have been filed. The grand jurors have done their work extra-- ALEX HUNTER: We do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time. CINDY MARRA: I think he felt a huge weight lifted off of his shoulders when he heard that announcement. JOHN RAMSEY: It was a funny feeling because, you know, in your life, you've got things planned. You got a plan for tomorrow, and I got a plan for tomorrow. We didn't have a plan for tomorrow. We were going to be in jail. Thank you very much. Lou Smit's information when he testified before the grand jury was that an intruder did it. That had to factor in to the decision by the three prosecuting attorneys that, hey, this is going to be brought up by a good defense attorney. REPORTER: Are you satisfied? PAULA WOODWARD: They did not believe there was enough evidence to take them to trial and convict them. REPORTER: Does this mean they're going to be off? They're free? We called Lou and met with him that afternoon, and we just said thank you for being committed to this, and we really appreciate it. Our family appreciates it. That was the most important thing we could do at that point in our minds. If Lou Smit had not testified as a witness before the grand jury, the Ramseys would have been indicted for first degree murder. [music playing] LARRY KING: Tonight, it's one of the most sensational unsolved crimes in US history. Who brutally killed JonBenet Ramsey in her own home on Christmas night 1996? It's a great pleasure to welcome to "Larry King Live" tonight Lou Smit, the renowned Colorado detective who has investigated more than 200 homicides. CINDY MARRA: My dad wasn't going to let the Ramsey case die. After he left the DA's office, he started working the case on his own. LARRY KING: Have you been paid? LOU SMIT: No, this is not a paid job. I'm doing it mainly because I do want to seek the truth. He would not accept any pay. We couldn't reimburse him for expenses. I tried to buy Lou an ice cream cone one day, and he wouldn't accept the gift. He was that ethical. I believe that if law enforcement and others look carefully at the case, we have a good chance of catching the killer yet. MARK SMIT: He was determined to keep the intruder theory alive. He felt like it hadn't been fully investigated, and he was the only one left to do it. LARRY KING: What's it done to you? I'm just a retired detective that wants to retire. But I won't be able to do that as long as this case is open. There's a very dangerous killer out there. In my mind, I see this person. Thank you, Lou. Thank you. Lou stuck with this case because his commitment was to the victim. His responsibility was to JonBenet. [music playing] CINDY MARRA: My dad created a list of people and items that were important to this case. CINDY MARRA: Any name that had been brought up with regard to this case was put on this list. And then, from there, he prioritized it in the hopes that, at some point, there would be one person left on that list-- the killer. CINDY MARRA: He felt the DNA was very important in this case. [music playing] In 2000, Boulder got a new DA. Her name was Mary Lacy. She was an expert in sex crimes. And she wanted to find out whether or not there was validity to the intruder theory. MARK SMIT: As unlikely as it was, she asked my dad to come back and volunteer for the case, so he did have a second bite at the apple under Mary Lacy to go back and work on the case. I believe very strongly that we should start again. There are some strong leads that can be found out even now. REPORTER: DNA testing like this may determine who is or is not the killer of JonBenet Ramsey. CINDY MARRA: Mary Lacy tried to determine what additional evidence there might be that could yield DNA. And since it was thought that she had been sexually assaulted, they looked to the long johns she was wearing, thinking that somebody would have had to touch them in order to pull them down and pull them back up. So they sent those long johns in for testing. 20 minutes till the top of the hour now, and we are following breaking news in the JonBenet Ramsey murder case. They found DNA in those long johns. The DNA was consistent with the DNA found in her panties in 1997. The DNA was foreign and had been determined not to belong to any member of the Ramsey family. The parents have now been cleared in that little girl's murder. So Mary Lacy exonerated the Ramseys based on the DNA from this new report, as well as just the totality of all the other evidence that had been collected over the years. REPORTER: Boulder District Attorney Mary Lacy is meeting with John Ramsey now. She's giving him a letter stating that the Ramseys are no longer suspects, that she's deeply sorry for everything the family has endured, and that they will now be treated as victims of the crime due to the horrific loss they suffered. CINDY MARRA: Unexplained DNA on the victim of a crime is powerful evidence. There is no innocent explanation for its incriminating presence at three sites on these two different items of clothing that JonBenet was wearing at the time of her murder. I was very grateful for her courage to do the right thing. For the Ramseys, you know, there is somewhat that peace of mind that knowing that, you know, their name has been cleared in that. It's huge. This is huge news. REPORTER: All right, well thank you very much. That was a big deal for my dad because, at that point, he finally felt like he had rustled things to a neutral position. OK, now, everybody can just look at this from an objective perspective. I think my dad did regret that it came too late for Patsy. Patsy was diagnosed with cancer very early in life, but she beat cancer into remission. And then, in 2002, the cancer came back. It eventually attacked her brain. And in 2006, she died. Now to Atlanta and word today of the death of Patsy Ramsey. The mother of murder victim JonBenet Ramsey died of cancer. JOHN ANDREW RAMSEY: Patsy knew that people thought of her as a child killer, but she also knew the facts, and she knew the truth. JOHN RAMSEY: Patsy loved her children dearly. That's what the real tragedy is that Patsy's been so maligned as this awful mother. She was an amazing mother, so it's real tragic that the media has painted as such a wicked person because she wasn't at all. I'd like to welcome you to our home. We wish you a very-- [music playing] LOU SMIT: I see the killer of JonBenet at the end of the intruder path, and that's the way I'm going to continue to go. MARK SMIT: My dad never gave up on a case ever. It didn't matter how old that case got. He would never give up on it. LOU SMIT: I believe this case can be solved because a detective always believes that the case can be solved. It's not a question of solving it. It's just a question of when it will be solved. He was committed to the case to the very end. He wasn't going to give up on it. CINDY MARRA: In the spring of 2010, my dad was starting to get bothered by some stomach pain. And in June of 2010, he underwent exploratory surgery. And the doctors came out and said he was just full of cancer. That case was still on the top of his mind. He wasn't going to let something like cancer make him give up. If anything, I think that he still felt that he hadn't completed his task. We were with my dad, and he gave me a name. He said, you know, this is who you need to start with. We decided that we would try and do our best to carry that on to not let the case die. He was all wired up with tubes and probes and stuff. And it was a hard meeting. I knew that's probably the last time I'd see him. And Lou told me in hospice as he was dying, he said, John, if the case remains in the Boulder Police hands, it probably will never be solved. And that's the first time he admitted that he wasn't going to get the guy. And sadly, we lost him. Lou believed that as one charged with bringing justice for the victim of a crime, that he stands in the victims' shoes. I had the privilege of speaking at his funeral. All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. Lou was a good man who courageously stepped forward in front of a tidal wave of opinion, who if I was to describe him with one word, it would be integrity. I know when I approached his casket, I cried like a baby. I was very sad that we lost Lou, both as a friend and as a very important part of this case. [music playing] He fought to get the truth in front of people because he knew the system was capable of sending us to prison, of convicting us, maybe executing us. I don't know. So in that way, he did save our lives. Lou gave us hope that the case might be solved. The public narrative is that this was a perfect crime. This was a perfect murder. But we have a mountain of evidence. We have DNA. JonBenet's murder can be solved. REPORTER: The case of the Golden State Killer had baffled investigators for decades, suspected of killing a dozen people and raping more than 50 women in the 1970s and '80s. We all knew that we were looking for a needle in a haystack, but we also all knew that the needle was there. REPORTER: Ultimately, a DNA match led to DeAngelo. Now to a break in a case cold for 44 years. 16-year-old Pamela Maurer was strangled, and now police say they finally know who killed her. CINDY MARRA: We're very encouraged by the fact that a lot of cold cases, 20, 30 years old, are being solved now. JOHN RAMSEY: Lou believed strongly that this was going to be solved by the DNA. We haven't found a match yet, but there's lots of new opportunities to work that. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: There are so many advanced technologies in DNA that there really is no reason for us not to pursue those avenues in trying to find the killer or killers of JonBenet. REPORTER: Detectives spent eight days scouring the Ramsey home for any potential evidence. Hundreds of items seized including bed sheets, towels, robes, a hammer, a baseball bat. There's hundreds of pieces of physical evidence that could contain the killer's DNA. We also know that lots of those items have never been tested. CINDY MARRA: We as private citizens can't do any of that testing. Boulder has those items in evidence, and without them, we can't get any DNA testing done. There's nothing we could do other than plead with the police to do it. JOHN SAN AGUSTIN: There is strong evidence out there. The question is whether or not the Boulder Police Department and the Boulder District Attorney's Office will now go after that person or people responsible for this murder. [music playing] I look at it now as I want this closure, not for me, not for Patsy, but for my children and my grandchildren. You know, they have to live with this in their lives, this unknown. JOHN ANDREW RAMSEY: JonBenet was a six-year-old child that was taken from her bed on Christmas day and violently murdered. And it's our obligation and our responsibility to find the killer, to find who did that. CINDY MARRA: What we're doing right now is very personal to me. I mean, I loved my dad dearly. I respected him so much. And if we could carry on what he asked us to continue, we'd love to be able to go to my dad's grave and be able to say the killer has been found. That would just-- you know, it would mean a lot to me. When you look at the whole of this case and all of the media and the coverage and everything else, lost in all of that is a little girl named JonBenet. That's what was important to my dad. My dad kept a wallet with pictures of the victims in it as a reminder. And I did find this picture in there. That's JonBenet. Justice is still crying out for her, and I think it's up to us not to let that cry go unheard. [music playing]
