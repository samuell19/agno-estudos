What's wrong? And where the hell am I? -Yes... -Sis, when are you coming? Dinner is ready. I'll be there soon. It's an evil spirit! What? An evil spirit? It's a very dirty incubus. The evil spirit is calling you to receive it. You must receive it. Is there any way I can avoid it? Not at all! If not, you'll die. You'll resist, but die after all. No other option. It'll chase you after to the end of the world. Then, just tell me when it'll depart from me. I have no clue. It can leave you tomorrow, or be with you until you die. Your parents passed away. Do you have any family? "After 3 years" Why don't you do a blind date? Guys this time are hotties! It's the best line-up ever! Killing body and good looking! I told you I will never go out. No way... You become serious whenever we talk about men. Why are you wasting your invincible youth? You always cooped yourself in the library. Life is short. You enjoy your life. I have to leave school if I don't get scholarship. You're working part-time, aren't you? I'm always in short of money. Dean is calling you! You should go to his office. Why? Well, I have no idea. Maybe he'll help you find a job? TA told me an internship at the City Hall is available. -City Hall? -Yes. You do well at school. You deserve that job! Come on in. Did you call... You're here, Yeon-hui! What are you doing? Come in and have a seat. I called you here because you two had an unsavory affair a few years ago. So I called you to prevent it from happening again. Hope you don't act awkward. Professor! I feel uneasy you set up the meeting unexpectedly. I have nothing to say, so I'm off now. You should keep seeing each other! What? Hak-cheol returns to school from this semester. Then it's time for me to take a leave of absence. You still have the temper. You should've saved his face in front of me. You've got even prettier. Didn't you miss me? Are you going to ignore me now? Don't do this to me. What are you talking about? It was just a big hello, cuz it's been so long. What? Hak-cheol? That bastard is returning to school? Are they lost their minds? He decided to come back while you are still here? What's wrong with the school accepting him? What should I do? I can't take a leave of absence. Did he say you should take a leave? Not really, but... Well, how can you take classes with that psycho? Here is your order. -Oh no, I am sorry. -What's wrong with you? I'll give you new one again. I'm sorry. Why are you so scared? You embarrassed me. What do you expect? You just popped up. I'm sorry. By the way, you still live here! I was just wondering. I really liked this place. In fact, we have many memories at this place. Like our first kiss under the streetlight. Yeon-hui. Why did you come here? Let's start again. It's a shame that you never visited me there. Why should I go there? I don't want to go back. Don't do this to me, Yeon-hui. I'll do better. Stay away. Yeon-hui, are you okay? Don't touch me. Ah, I remember it now. Your eyes... You were looking at me like that at the police office too. Did I really make a big mistake? You just treat me like a bug. Or am I even less than a bug? Is it horrible to like you? Tell me. Is it that horrible you treat me like a bug? Stop it! Please stop. Yeon-hui. I had to go to the police and the army, but I never blamed you. I will never trouble you again. Please trust me and let's make a fresh start. What? You went to the police and the army because of me? What about me felt like to die because of you? We'll never go back to the relationship, even if I die. Even if you die? That means we can be together when we die? But that's too easy. I thought this kind of thing is only from the movie. I'm very nervous. You're the star of the movie, so don't be nervous. Then, just trust me. You are shivering more than I do. Yeon-hui, my heart's pounding. It's likely to burst. Wait! It's my first time. Really? Yeon-hui, thank you. I'll do better to you. Just promise me one thing. Don't leave me without a word. I see. You have my word. I'm sorry. Does it hurt? I'm fine. I'll never... leave you. I feel like I'm raped every night. Do you know him? No, I feel him, but I can't see his face It's too lively to be a dream. It's driving me crazy nowadays. Time to wrap it up. It's a madness to do a night shift. Look at the dark bags under my eyes. How could you put up with that? You also signed up for a night shift next week? I like working at night. It's quiet and I focus better. You're cut out for night shift. So, what do you think night is for? What're you thinking about? It's for sleep. You thought something else? People have to sleep at night. It's better if you're with men. These days, I feel like to meet incubus. Incubus? You don't know incubus? A ghost comes for sex with women! I didn't believe before when some asked for counseling. I searched online and found there're many cases in real. Surprisingly, quite many enjoy it more than with men. I wonder how it feels like. I'd better off now. I'm coming with you. Cafe Latte will be ready soon. Okay. Oh, hello. -Americano... -Large size and 2 shots, right? Excuse me, Miss... I'm sorry. I can't believe she skipped the test after studying so hard. You're a best friend of Yeon-hui, aren't you? I don't see her anymore. Her cell phone's off too. What's happened to her? I don't know. You have no clue? No. Yeon-hui! Yeon-hui! Yeon-hui. Yeon-hui! Hey! Yeon-hui! Yeon-hui! Come back to earth! I can't make it today. It's an emergency Yes. I'm sorry. She refused to go to the hospital. And I found your number and called you. Did something happen to Yeon-hui? Well, I'm not so sure. She was absent and her phone was dead for days. So I came over just in case. And as you see... You said you are Seon-mi? Yes, please treat me like your sister. I feel close to you because you're Yeon-hui's sister. Yes, thank you. Yeon-hui! Yeon-hui! Who's that person? Just a second! Open the door, Yeon-hui! What's the matter? Who are you and why are you at Yeon-hui's house? I'm her big sister. who are you? I didn't hear she had a sister. Believe it or not, it's not my business. If you came to see my sister, not today. So I should just leave after talking with a stranger? Right, she is Yeon-hui's real sister. I'm sorry... I never heard from her there's her sister. Can I talk to you a little bit? Okay. But can I see her first? It won't be long. She's sleeping now. Maybe next time. Stop pacing around. I feel dizzy. Yeon-hui, are you okay? Why do you keep surprising me? Did you take the test? How can you worry about the test? What's happened to you? I don't know. My body feels weird. Why? What's wrong? Somebody keeps coming into my room and then... I am not quite sure how to explain it. The door's locked safe. You haven't eaten at all, huh? Let's eat first, okay? Alright, wait a minute. Nothing's here in the fridge. Any stored food at home? Maybe not. I should ask Yeon-su to buy some food on her way. Who? How do you know my sister? I called her. I never asked you to call her! What happened to you both? Isn't it a time to reconcile? Where are you going, all of a sudden? Please don't do this to me! Our parents left only you and me alone. You can't do this to me! I'm annoyed. For how much longer do I need to take care of you? You're grown up now. Look after yourself. Sis! I want to live my life freely. Don't look for me! Hak-cheol, Yeon-hui's stalker. He made her suffer a lot. Finally, she called the police about 3 years ago. His parents pleaded for mercy so she gave him a chance. Perhaps, Yeon-hui's acting like this because... This is the best I could get now. Please help yourself. Why are you doing this to Yeon-hui? What? I don't understand... You stalked my sister, didn't you? Stalking? You must have got it wrong. I never stalked her. And Yeon-hui liked me so much. Maybe she did in the past, but it seems not anymore. Don't come to see her anymore. Please do me a favor. What are you? Yeon-hui had difficult and lonely days. Now you show up and act like a sister? What on earth do you want from Yeon-hui? I promised I would never leave her. I'll not stand with you if you stalk my sister. Yeon-hui will soon love me like she did before. Yeon-hui's awake. Where are you? I'm almost there. Then, can you buy her something to eat on your way? Why not? What should I buy? What do you want, Yeon-hui? I said what do you want? Yeon-hui. What's wrong? Seon-mi, what's up? What's going on? Yeon-hui! What was it? Hey! Yeon-hui! What's wrong? I don't want to do it! What's the matter? Seon-mi, didn't you see a person just now? A man! Who is he? There were only you and me. I must have gone crazy. Seon-mi! Seon-mi! Seon-mi! Yeon-hui! Oh, Yeon-su! Yeon-hui, just for a sec. I'm coming Yeon-su. Yeon-hui! Are you okay? What's wrong? Why now? Yeon-hui. You don't need to care about me. Yeon-hui, I'm sorry. I don't have a sister anymore. So leave now. Yeon-hui! Leave me alone. Yeon-su, blood! I'm fine. It's not okay. You're bleeding. Why did you run away from me? Yeon-hui, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I was so scared and lonely after you left me. I'm sorry. I'll never leave you. Let's move to my house. I think it's a good idea. You never know when the dork will come back here. Thank you for today. Take care. I'll text you my address. I'll drop by after school. Thank you. See you tomorrow. You don't even have a TV. Is it really your house? It's my house though it is rental. You should've gone well off after leaving me alone. Why? Not sleepy? Lying next to you, I miss our parents, too. Sweet dreams! Sis! I'm here. What're you doing? Oh? Why? Your belly... Huh? Oh, no! What's wrong with my belly? What's wrong with it? What happened to my belly? What's wrong with my belly! Yeon-hui, calm down. Sis, what happened? Since when? I have no clue. Shit! Seon-mi. Yes? -Seon-mi. -I don't know anything. What? Yeon-hui... Yeon-hui? She didn't come to school today? Yes, she seemed so fragile yesterday. Oh, dear. Is she really sick? It must be tough for her working and studying at once. She's still young. Too bad. By the way, can I borrow your lecture notebook? I skipped the class last week. Alright. It's in the locker. Wait a sec. 'SEON-MI, MY ADDRESS IS 372 -45 YAKSU-DONG, JUNG-GU, SEOUL" Weird...I guess I put it in the bag. -Hey, call my number. -Alright. Take it. Who is it? That's my phone. Where are you? It's a locksmith store. "Front Door" Is there nobody? Damn it! "SEON-MI INCOMING CALL" It's strange. You look pregnant for sure, but actually you're not. Look here. The embryo should be here. But as you see, there's nothing. Your belly seems to be already more than 10 weeks. It means you could see it in the womb. This is a different case from imaginary pregnancy. Then, what should we do? Why don't you go through a complete check-up? There's need to check the different part of your body. Freezing! Should I just go? Oh? It's opened. Yeon-hui. Crazy bitch! You're eating like a pig. Yeon-hui. How did you come in? It was opened! Didn't you lock the door? I must've forgot to lock. She seems to be in a bad mood. I can see that too. Sissy, she made me feel embarrassed. Sorry, she's a bit sensitive now. Why are you sorry to me? Yeon-hui. Yes. I see. Seon-mi, I have to go to work now. It seems operators are in short today. I'm very sorry. You should go. Don't worry about her. Thank you. I'll try to come back soon. Okay. She's sleeping too long. Fuck! Damn it! No don't do this! No, don't come near. What the...son of bitch! Hak-cheol! Yeon-hui! Open your eyes, please? What's going on, huh? Why are you doing this? What's wrong? Who is he? A son of bitch! What's wrong with her belly? Yeon-hui. Your belly... Who did this to Yeon-hui? Who the hell? Yeon-hui. Did you avoid me because of this? Who the hell is the son of bitch? Police? Come here quickly. "SEON-MI INCOMING CALL" Call me anytime. Hello? Hak-cheol broke in with a knife! What? You look pregnant and you must've been really scared. You don't really need to see your doctor? What a jerk! What's a normal looking guy like him doing stalking? You must put him into jail this time. He must be rich to have bought such expensive gadget. His parents' money don't do any good to him. Yeon-hui. Are you alright? Aren't you hurt? Sis! I'm here. Don't worry. You liked stir-fried fish cake. Is it still your favorite? I can't make the same taste. I tried a couple of times, but it wasn't the same as mom's. But your food is as good as hers. So delicious. Yummy! You're good enough to sell your own side dish. Really? I will pack some for you too. Sounds great! Thank you. -Hello? -It's me. Who...? Why did you call me? Is she there? My pretty Yeon-hui? Why did you call me? I'll just get to the point. My lawyer said my case can be extenuated if only you agree. That will never happen. I didn't also expect it. But I want to tell you I really love her Hope you understand it. Never again! Don't call me. Wait! Hang on! I am telling you an important thing. Our country's law is absurd. Still one month's left till the trial. Approach prohibition doesn't affect me at all. I can do many things in a month. Don't you think so? Lastly, who the hell knocked her up? Don't answer me, if you don't want. I will find and kill him. Come here and eat! Alright. You go ahead. Are you still at work? When are you coming home? I'm almost there. Count 10. 1,2 3,4,5 6, 7, 8,9 -10 -I made it. Call the police. Yeon-hui, give it to me. This is 118-1304, Dongdaemoon Hankuk Apt Come over here quickly. If you leave now, I'll pretend nothing happened. I have enough time before the police comes. I already told you I have a month left. Yeon-hui, how could you have done this to me? You know I love you, don't you? But then, how could you have slept with someone else? Hak-cheol, you know what? I hate you even more than what bothered me. So just stop it. Fuck you, you have that same face again? Why is it too difficult to love you? Let's die! We die together and reborn. Let's make a fresh start. We have no other option. Yeon-hui, run away. Die! Sis! Sis...Sis... Let's die together! Die with me! Stop it! Yeon-hui! Yeon-hui! Yeon-hui, wake up! Let's get out of here. What happened to Hak-cheol? I just heard he's still unconscious. He's got shock because he bled too much. But doctors have to see how it goes. Did you see it, didn't you? The knife stood by itself when he fell down on it. I guess it was the incubus that bothered me. It protected me from dying... What's going to happen to me? Do I have to suffer from the incubus until I die? I won't make that happen. You didn't detach the evil yet. The incubus must have moved to my baby sister. It sounds very horrible. I kept distance from my sister on purpose to keep her safe. What should I do now... I want to protect her. Anything I can do? You'd better prepare for death. Can you still do it? Bastard! How dare you covet young ladies You're worse than animal. Bastard! Where do you think you are? I've waited for you. I'll accept you. Oh my! My belly... Sis, my belly's flat now. Sis! Where is she? Sis! There's only one solution. If you die while you're possessed with the incubus, then the spirit will disappear. As the candle slowly burns over the night... "After 2 years" Please call me again and book tomorrow. Yes. Yes, KIM Yeon-hui speaking. Please have a look. This is our ambitious new plan in 18 years. According to your own investment taste, you can use this plan with the ones you already own. It's a ground-breaking plan. Please consider it for yourself. -Thank you. Drive safe. -I will. Why don't you say to me like, Want some noodle at my place? You eat it at your place. I see. Bye.
