REIJI IKEMOTO, 18 YEARS OLD ADDRESS: 1012 MISATO-CHO, YOSHIGAYA, SAITAMA PREFECTURE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT. CHANGED JOBS TWICE. Is it too hot, Grandpa? - No. Very good, isn't it, Reiji? - Yes. I'm always hungry at the moment. That's because you're eating for the baby, too. There's a notice from the Employment Agency for you. Unemployment compensation. How much will you get? Not much. He was with a small factory. Not as much as he'd get from a big company. Farming is best. You'll never starve! He's right. PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT SECURITY OFFICE - You're Reiji Ikemoto? - Yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Serve people more politely. It's your job! - If it isn't Reiji! - Uta! It's been a long time! Let me introduce you. We went to school together. This is Reiji. Naoko and Yuko. They work at a snack bar in Mito. - Nice to meet you. - Same here. Hey, Uta, drop in at our shop some time. Naoko used to be a delinquent. She doesn't look it. - I had sex with her. - Really? Sure. I wasn't the only one. Others did, too. She never says no. That's what they say. - Let's meet at the Yamazato tonight. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Uta, do you still live at home? For now. But I plan to move out soon. Bye. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. - Got a driver's license? - Sure. - Last time, the car was dirty. - Really? I don't mind lending it to you, but at least clean it. I understand. Don't drive too fast. SHOZO UTAGAWA, 20 YEARS OLD JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT. CHANGED JOBS 12 TIMES. CONVICTED TWICE FOR WILLFUL DESTRUCTION OF EQUIPMENT That was hysterical! Ha! Didn't you enjoy it? I won't do anything. Are you angry? Are you in love with somebody else? How could I be? Then walk arm-in-arm with me. I... I'll be going now. I have to get up early. Then I'll walk you home. Zensaku, do you like children? Eh? Well, not especially. I like them. I want to have a baby. Zensaku, what do you do on your days off? Nothing in particular. I stay home. I see. You live with your parents. - Don't you go out? - Sure... but I've nowhere interesting to go. What are you doing?! Stop! Stop! Stop or I'll scream! Let's go over there. Let's go. No! You're filthy! I don't like you! YAMAZATO I was surprised to meet you there. You're right! - Uta! - Hey, Reiji! I recognised your voice. - Did you just get off work? - Nope. I quit my job. The boss was a bastard. - And your apartment? - I moved out. - Madam, give him a glass. - Right. - Here. - Thanks. - Have a drink. Cheers! - Reiji, how much money you got? - About 10,000 yen. - What about you? - Not much... That shop was expensive. I've only got 5,000 yen. I'll pay for the drinks... but we need 50,000 yen for those two girls. They'll be glad to take the money. Let's go through those apartments. Watch for the cops. Good idea! Get out! Find some girls? I'm so drunk... Are they all screwing? Hey! Let's steal 'em and sell 'em. Hurry! - Closed already? - Yes, we close at two. - Where's Naoko? - She went home. - You lied! - Don't gripe! - Good morning. - Good morning. I found his bicycle. Where's Zensaku? I don't know. Satoru, finish your breakfast. Your teacher said to eat more. Husband, it's already 8:30. Scum! You stole eggs! Shozo was arrested. You were seen! Fool! Ass! The police require you and Zensaku to go to the station. What a mess! I'm so disgusted! You stole Taizo's eggs... I've known Taizo since he was a kid. He'll probably forgive them. I'm sorry. Let's ask him to drop the charge. He's a bit strange, but he'll understand. Hello, Mrs Eguchi. Is Taizo here? Lady! Where's Taizo? At the river. That way. TAIZO EGUCHI, 42 YEARS OLD Taizo. Did you see Taizo's wife? - Yeah. She has fair skin. - She's pretty. They say she's insane. What'll happen to Shozo? We paid him for the eggs. Shozo'll be released. - The three of you did it? - Sorry. Thank him. He says he'll forgive you. Thank you. He's a kind man. And that saved you. If I'd known you'd done it, I wouldn't have reported it. POLICE STATION They didn't steal them. They just threw them in the river. Will you forgive them? Shozo may have a record, but he isn't that bad. - Did they pay you? - Well, sort of... Don't patronise youngsters. Teach them a lesson. No. I was drunk and left my truck there. It was my fault, too. I understand. Come in! Remember this? You're being released because Mr Eguchi is a kind man. You don't have to release me. I can't pay. Damn you! Then stay here! Let me talk to him. Shozo, what counts most is money. Money. Just money. - Was I wrong taking money? - No. - Then don't complain. - You hate money? - No, I like it. - I know. When I was young, I was like you, too. I know how you feel. Shozo, they came for you. Thank you very much. Let's all go and eat. Don't gobble it! Check, please. Let us pay. - Don't worry. - Thank you. Drink with this and cheer up. You shouldn't. Your grandmother paid me for the eggs. - But... - Never mind. Goodbye. Thank you! - Your change. - Thanks. Bye. - Thank you! They say he's strange, but he's nice. He's showing off. It's her! - What happened? - Naoko's in that car. - You stood us up last night! - Sorry! Citizens of this town, we're sorry to surprise you! That Zensaku... He likes you. He wants to be friends with you. Please be nice to him. He's a steady type. - Here. - What's that? From him. He can't give it to you himself. A present from him. A whole 20,000 yen. He's rich. He's nice, isn't he? Let's go. Arm in arm. Don't touch my breasts! - Don't! - Why not? Here we are. That's my place. Get out. Hurry! Let's go. Why are you so mad? Did you give her the money? You should've introduced me first. That's true. That money was from my family. Remember that. I really want to bang her. Zensaku's older than you. You've got to take it. - No! - Not even a kiss? - It's getting hard! - Think so? I'll do it myself. Get me a rubber. They're under the bedding. I'll do it for you. Don't move. Turn around. - I like it this way! - I don't! Don't touch them! You'll spoil the mood. Want to wipe it? Hurry! Shall we do it again? Lick my breasts. Let's have an encore! Will you get lost! Is it getting hard? - Show me it! - No! I'll rub it for you. Show me it. Do it quickly! Show me! Hurry! Yours is a big one. Show me yours, too. Is there a difference? Yours is bigger. But yours is harder! You can come if you want. Satisfied? - No! - Let's do it as we did before. - I didn't like it! - Come on. It's your turn. No! Not both at the same time! Idiot! Don't look at me! Don't put it there. Fool! Don't look at me! Let me look at you. I'm in you. It's warm, right? You liked it? What's wrong? I did it in an odd position. My hip hurts. Wanna get a drink? No, my mother'll be worried. - Okay. - I'll go home, too. See you, then. Scum! Why are you here? You don't belong here! Husband, I'll talk to him later. He's no son of mine! - Ass of a father, too. - What's that?! - I demand respect. - I demand it, too! Shozo! Don't be like that! Zensaku and Reiji's parents tried very hard for them, so they weren't charged. But you didn't do anything for me! Naturally! It was an outsider who helped me with the police. Stop! You don't get in this house! Don't! That's for dyeing! - Scum! - Big man, aren't you? You built yourself a factory, but who'll live with you? You're stupid! You'd fight your father? Stop them! They're killing each other! Let them settle it themselves. Stop! What a thing to do! Mother! EMIKO EGUCHI, 34 YEARS OLD A weasel did it? We've got to bury the net more deeply. I smell something burning. Fool! Why didn't you turn off the heat? Because you told me to gather eggs. When you have two things to do, attend to them one by one. And you left the net! Emiko. I'll go into town. I didn't scold you because I hate you. I'm not angry. Be careful of fire. That's what I mean. It's just a warning. Understand? UOMURA RESTAURANT Hello! I have some carp for you. Two carp and eight catfish. Thank you very much. I've got blisters. Driving a taxi's easier. Take it and you can lay those waitresses again. Get money from your grandpa. - I can't. - Should I work, too? Not at that construction site. A gas company's better. I had a wet dream last night. It was about Yuko. You're really horny! I sure am! I jerked off after the wet dream. Twice. My groin ached! You're the same old dandy. - You're great, too. - I'm flattered! A new guy? I invite factories to develop rural areas. But it can decrease the amount of subsidies. That's how it is. There's an American stripper at Kawaguchi! She's a real blonde. They say she screws on stage... with a great big dick, like this! I wish I could do it. I'd like to ram it in real deep! Her snatch'd be surprised! Can't you speak more decently? All you think about is sex! Taizo! Don't sleep here. You'll catch a cold. Wake up! I had a good sleep. I get drunk easily. I'll drive for you. You will? Thanks. Emiko! I'm back. I'm with some friends. Come in. Good evening. Emiko, they brought me home. They're very kind. Make some soup for them. My late wife. Make yourselves at home. Smoke. She died 10 years ago. I was pretty rough in those days. I wouldn't have minded selling even my wife for money. - Know the gay quarters? - I've heard. She did all she could for me. But actually, I made more of my friends than of her. I feel sorry for her now. That's how men should be, right? I don't know. I suppose friends are important, but... - What about you? - Let me see... Marriage has its advantages. You can get laid for free any time you want! Your soup. - Looks good. - One bowl each. Be careful! It's good. Hurry! I don't like those young men. - I'm afraid of them. - Afraid? They may look rough, but they're naive. You're very nice. Wonderful! It's pounding so hard. You sure love it, don't you? - You live around here? - Yes, in Misato-cho. Do you know Taizo Eguchi? - He was a street peddler. - I know him well. He's a nice guy. Too good-natured to be a street-peddler. How's his new wife? Is she well? I bet she's got a nice box. She was a waitress at a restaurant in town. A cheap joint, damn near being a whore house. Did she sleep with the customers? Once in a while. She loves it! She rarely said no. It's a big one! Eat carp and live long. Let me sing for you. He's drunk in broad daylight! What a pity! If he can afford sake, he should buy you a dress or something. He gets like that on Sundays. The guests pay for the sake. No trouble for us. Help me with this, Mother. "How are you, Zensaku? "I'm still angry. "Don't do anything like that anymore. "Today's Friday. I hate Fridays... "because Sunday comes so soon. "I hate Saturday nights, too. "I hate Sundays even more. "I think I'd be very happy with you now. "But you tend to make me angry. "Promise you'll never do it again. "Then I'll come back and see you." Up already? I'll fix breakfast for you. No, thanks. I'll go see Shozo. He's leaving home. That's better for him. He's old enough to fend for himself. In another 10 years, there won't be any farmers around here. Then I'll buy that field, too. You want even more? I'll raise five million yen this year. Finish your work there. Reiji! I got an apartment. Come on over tonight. - Those chicks are coming, too. - Really? - Yeah. Tell Taizo to come, too. - You sure? - We'll give him a woman as a token of our thanks. I'm sure he loves women. Let's invite him, then. Don't do that! You do good work. I don't want you to go. They came for me. I have to go. She's got a nice ass. I know you'll like her. What are you saying? - You shouldn't tease me. - I shouldn't? Shozo said you're my friend. Uta, we're here. - Where are the women? - Gone, as you can see. Please come in. - Have some beer. - Thanks. She's gone. She went driving with some student. Damn bitch! What about a cabaret? Know where we can get laid? I know, but it's expensive. - How much? - 20,000 yen for one. I don't have enough. - You know the madame at the Yamazato? - Yeah. I hear she shows her pussy whenever she gets drunk. Let's get her and have an orgy! Yes, let's! Guzzle, guzzle, guzzle. You have no limit! Are you going to give me a gang-bang? Listen, folks. As the temple gong sounds, the wind starts blowing... over the Sumida River. Pass by the South Senju cemetery, where patriots are buried. Then go farther north, step by step. Then you'll arrive in Yoshigaya. That's how a female sot was born. They call her Otama, the lush. You mean me? Observe how she swills. You're good, I like you. Bravo! When she drinks, she doesn't care what happens. It?s her destiny. She was born that way. For her, the world is just a river of blood. She knows how shameless she is. Yet she can't stop drinking, for sake is her all. I'll drink myself to death! Now for the main attraction! She's going to display her pussy! Applause! If you don't applaud, you can't see it. I haven't taken a bath for 10 days. It reeks! I need a piss! That's not the toilet! She's really pissing! Wipe it! She really did it! We've gone too far. I'm Otama, the lush! Let's go inside. No, not here! She's too much! Let's go to Tokyo. I have money. It's midnight! Aren't we friends? Didn't you promise me a broad? We're off to Tokyo! - He's strange. - He's too much, too. He'll always be a nobody. You'll catch a cold. We sure had an orgy! Is he all right? He's sound asleep. Trying to kill us? We're too drunk to drive. Let's try it tomorrow. Help me. He all right? I'll do it. Go ahead. I can't carry him! His wife's waiting, right? Why not screw her? She's got a clean box and she'll never turn us down. Won't he get mad? We'll just apologise. We can pay him, too. Madame! We brought Taizo home, ma'am. He's drunk. Where is he? He's soused. He's sick. He said to make his bed for him. Not here. In the other room. Don't do that! Help! Cover her mouth! Her skin's smooth for her age. Hold her! Just let me shove it in. Turn her over. It's good this way, too. Great! Something's wrong with her. Madame! Madame! This is bad. What'll we do? ARTICLE 181 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE: RAPE AND MURDER THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF THE CRIMES... STIPULATED IN ARTICLES 176 AND 179, AND HAVE CAUSED A PERSON TO DIE SHALL BE PUNISHED BY PENAL SERVITUDE FOR FROM THREE YEARS TO LIFE. Where's Emiko? Emiko! What happened? I'm sorry. Sorry? You fellows did it? I'm sorry! Forgive us! We didn't mean to kill her. We came to tell her you were drunk. Then somehow... she suddenly lost consciousness. But... I didn't rape her! Kill me if you want! Do as you please! I won't run. I'll even go to the police. The police...? Forget about that. What are we supposed to do, then? Get out. Go away! What'll we do? Report it to the police? He said not to. You strangled her, didn't you? - That's why she died. - The hell I did! It's your fault! You shoved it in wrong. It killed her. Stop it! You may not have raped her, but you're an accomplice. Besides, I bet Reiji's right. We only raped her. You killed her. I'm going home. If you go to the cops, take me with you. All right. But let's go to work for today. We'll decide then. I don't get you. Did you hit her, or strangle her? Just raping her wouldn't have killed her. She suddenly groaned, and then... - Find out what happened. - No! I'll phone the lawyer. Is Taizo home? He said to forget the police. Ask him why. Tell him I'll support him for a whole year. Tell him that. Got it? I'm sorry, Mother. Taizo! I'll clean you up. You're hurt. I'll wash you... then you'll be clean. I'll wash you. Taizo's gone mad! What happened? He was bathing with her body. You're so pretty. I love you. I'm sorry. I had too much to drink. It's my fault. Taizo! Emiko! It's as if you killed her! Why didn't you close her eyes? The poor thing! She looks so miserable. She's dead. You should've made her look better. You could've at least closed her eyes. What'll you do now? Reiji did it, didn't he? Did you report it to the police? Answer me! Don't touch her. She's mine. - Is Reiji around? - He's off today. Why didn't you report it sooner? You destroyed the evidence by washing her. The Coroner reported... she died of a heart attach while being raped. She had a heart problem, right? You didn't know? Didn't she appear to be in pain occasionally? Those three were the same ones who stole your eggs. They made fun of you. You should've gone harder on them that time. - I got it... - What? Persons who commit crime... are apt to steal from people who were kind to them. Strangely, they never steal from... people who treat them with indifference. Where are you going? Sit down. She wasn't enjoying it! Sit down! They deliberately got you drunk, and they raped your wife. It was pre-meditated. - They aren't bad boys. - Are you still protecting them? I was just unlucky... That's all it was. Take this to the hospital. Then you can cremate her. - Sir... - Sir. She scratched me just out of pain? Stop it! I let you in because you said you wouldn't touch me. - You lied! - Please don't move. - I'll scream! - Go ahead. I don't care what happens. Why? Why are you doing this? Answer me! Are you lonely? It's trouble for me. Try to think... What'll happen to us? I feel miserable. I'm so unfortunate. - I'm sorry... - I feel like crying, too. I have some money. Take it all. Fool! What'll I do? What do you want me to do? You want me to go to the police with you, or run with you? Answer me! I'm sorry. Why don't we take a trip somewhere? Before we get arrested.
