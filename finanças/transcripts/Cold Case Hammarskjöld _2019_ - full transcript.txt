- Your name is Clarinah? - Yes. I know for a fact that... the villain of this story... he only wore white. He dressed in white all the time. Okay. That is what I have been told. I have one picture of him... where he is, um, completely dressed in white. Okay. - So, your name is Saphir? - Yes, my name is Saphir. We are in Hotel Memling because... - the villain of the film... - Yeah. ...in 1965, he was staying here. And he was dressing the way I'm dressing now. So, first sentence is... "This could either be"... Yes. ...the world's biggest murder mystery"... Yes. ..."or the world's most idiotic conspiracy theory." "If the latter is the case"... Yes. ..."I am very sorry." Ten years ago today, this organization... and much of the world as well, was shocked by a totally unexpected tragedy. Dag Hammarskjold, the Secretary General, was missing on a flight to Ndola... and all hope was lost... when the remains of the Secretary General's plane were sighted from the air. He was, in a very real sense, the world's first public servant. - So this is Ndola? - This is Ndola Airport. - It's your first time here? - Yes. - Your name? - Mads Brugger. - Mads Brugger? - Brugger. - Brug... - Brugger. Same here. And my name is Goran. I'm Mass. - Mads? - Yes, me, Mass. - Mass. - Your name is also Mads? - Yes. - That is really confusing. Mass! M-A-S-S. That's my name. It's exactly like my name. - Nice to meet you, Mass. - Thank you. But Mass, do you know why we are here? I don't know. We are here because we are making a documentary about the death of Dag Hammarskjold. Okay. - After a long time? - Yes. It's a cold case, you know? Yeah, yeah. We want to find out if Hammarskjold was the victim - of a conspiracy. - Okay. I mean, you've been doing your research for a long time? Six years. - Six years? - Yeah. Okay. What is the title of your documentary? - The title? - Yes. - "Cold Case Hammarskjold". - Ok. You think it's an okay title? - Do you have other titles? - No. Okay. Then, it means this one suits. So, you'll have to leave it. Now for the... - the beginning of the film. - Yes. The scene is, I am in a hotel, in Lubumbashi. - Yes. - In Katanga. Yeah. The old Leopold II Hotel. I am sitting in a room, playing solitaire. - You know, the card game? - Yeah. And... while you see me playing solitaire... there is a narration. It's the 17th of September 1961. Dag Hammarskjold, the Secretary General of the United Nations, boards a plane in the capital of the Congo. These are the last recordings made of him, because a few hours later, around midnight, he will be killed in a plane crash. I know that I am speaking for all of my fellow Americans, expressing our deep sense of shock and loss in the untimely death of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Dag Hammarskjold. The death of Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold reverberated around the world. Officially, the plane crashed because of pilot error; a simple misreading of the altimeter. The UN later made their own investigation, which was undecided between pilot error and a possible attempt to bring the plane down. But right from the beginning, there were rumors about a conspiracy to kill Dag Hammarskjold. My first thought, if I dare to say so, is that he has been murdered. Much has been forgotten, and much has been lost, in the passage of time. But the questions remain, Was Dag Hammarskjold murdered? And if so, who killed him? Did you know about Hammarskjold? No. I didn't know. Dag Hammarskjold became the UN Secretary General in 1953. At first, he was believed to be a boring Swedish technocrat, but, in fact, he was a flaming and strong-willed idealist. It is very easy to bow to the wish of a big power. It is another matter to resist. For Hammarskjold, one of the most important tasks of the UN was to protect the African countries who had recently gained independence, from the tentacles of old colonial powers. These new nations wish to build a life of progress in full independence. They look to the United Nations for moral, political and economic support. This made him a lot of enemies amongst the old colonial powers. So, if there ever was a time where members of the UN were longing for the death of the Secretary General, it was during the reign of Dag Hammarskjold. Whatever happens, stick to your guns... so that you can feel satisfaction with what you've done. Whatever the outcome. His plane crashed in the outskirts of a small mining town called Ndola, right on the border between the Congo and the British protectorate of Rhodesia. It was the perfect kill room. Isolated and far away from prying eyes and ears. Hammarskjold was on his way to Ndola for peace talks with Moise Tshombe... the rebel leader of the breakaway region Katanga. People need to know about Katanga. How Katanga in 1960... seceded from Congo, declared independence, and a war broke out. And it's important people understand that Katanga was basically the property of a giant Belgian corporation called Union Minière, a mining corporation. And it was more or less Union Minière who installed Moise Tshombe as the leader of Katanga... Yes. ...as a figurehead. Because right below him... the big mining corporations were running the shows. And they brought in a lot of mercenaries. In a perspective, which may well be short rather than long... the problem facing the Congo is one of peace or war. Dag Hammarskjold, he wants to fix the Katanga crisis. - Yes. - So he brings in UN soldiers. He attacks the mercenary army of Katanga... thinking it would be a quick fix. But the mercenaries are hardcore. - It's a disaster for the UN. - Mm-hmm. A lot of civilians are killed, also UN soldiers. Backed by mining interests and European mercenaries, Katanga had seceded from the Congo, and a UN lead military operation to capture Moise Tshombe and put an end to Katanga's secession from the Congo, had backfired. Mr. President. I regret that it has been necessary for me to call again the attention of the Security Council to the problem we are facing in the Congo. So... the Americans. I think also the British, tell Dag Hammarskjold, "You have to fix this now." - They are very angry at him. - Yes. He has moved beyond his mandate. He has gone rogue. That is why he flies in, you know, to Katanga... for meeting with Moise Tshombe... hoping that he can broker a peace deal with Moise Tshombe and stop the fighting. Then, he flies in, and just as the plane is about to land, - Yeah. - ...it crashes, and he dies. - What are we doing? - We are making a... We are doing a checkup on the equipment before we go to the burial site... - Okay. - ...of the wreckage. - Yeah. - First of all, we need to have the pictures you have found. - This? - There? Yes. So they keep the wreckage of the Albertina, Hammarskjold's plane, inside a sealed hangar... for many months. And then, in 1962, they bury everything. - Yes. - And through this picture we would be able to triangulate where the wreckage is buried. Oh, yes, that should be very possible. You know, thanks to the buildings you can see up here. I think, that's maybe the control tower, and there's some other buildings and a road here. Let's go through the equipment I have prepared for us. There are two pith helmets, because we will be working in sun, to protect our Scandinavian skin. - There are two shovels, - Goran: Mm-hmm. ...because, if possible, and nobody takes offence, we should be digging for the wreckage. And we will find the wreckage ultimately by using this metal detector with an extra powerful coil that I purchased for us in Johannesburg. And, finally, if and when we find the wreckage... two Cuban cigars... But, I don't smoke. - Bjorkdahl. - Goran Bjorkdahl. "What happened was this, Goran's father was a diplomat working for the UN. In that capacity, he visited the crash site at Ndola where Hammarskjold was killed. It was sometime in the 70's." "He was given a metal plate... which allegedly was coming from Dag Hammarskjold's plane. ..."was coming from Hammarskjold's plane." The plate had these strange... small, round little holes in it," which made Goran's father wonder. So, he brought the metal plate back to Sweden... and asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs if they had any interest in it. They told him no." "They told him no." Yes. "And so, many years later, when Goran's father is going to a nursing home for elderly people, Goran finds the metal plate amongst his father's belongings. He asks his father what the metal plate is about. And from that point onwards, Goran has been obsessed with the murder mystery of Dag Hammarskjold." "All by himself, Goran does something groundbreaking." He travels to Ndola and begins tracking down the remaining black witnesses. - Over there, then? Where was... - This side. That was that side? Okay. "Black people were not taken seriously as witnesses. And furthermore, many of them were afraid to come forward." You know, they were thinking, If they have killed Dag Hammarskjold... - Yeah. - ...what will they do to me, if I tell them what I know?" They were charcoal burners, living in the forest, very close to the crash. Yeah. So, they were the witnesses who were... as close to the event as possible. And we could see the plane going to, you know, to the airport to land. But, suddenly, I don't know what happened, the lights went off at the airport. "They talk about another plane in the air, which is shooting at Dag Hammarskjold's plane." - You said you heard a sound? - Yes. Another sound. - Another sound? - Yes. That sound was like a jet. We just saw the flash from the sky. There was a big plane coming this way and a small plane behind it. There was a sound like this, "Boom!" There was a fire. I told my boss, Mr. Jimmy James, he was my boss at the time. He was a Briton. And I said, "Something happened, what happened?" "There were no lights, the lights were switched off at the airport." And he just told me, "Shh." It came from the east, because the pilot, you know, made a long turn to avoid Katanga airspace. And the plane continued towards the west. That side. And it disappeared in the horizon. And just when it disappeared in the horizon over there, there was a bright red flash. - Over there? - Over there. Yes. People in Ndola saw it, many people saw it. What about Martin, who was here, manning the tower? Yeah, the radio controller, Martin, he claims, he didn't see it. Which is strange, because normally, he should've been sitting inside the tower... looking in that direction. He said he didn't see it. And that is not the only strange thing. Martin, of course he took notes. A controller has to take notes of the conversation with the pilots. He took notes, but for some reason... he destroyed his notes the next day. So, two days after the crash, he had to rewrite... his notes. Goran begins looking for the killers. Goran goes to London. In The Travelers Club... he meets with a... former American NSA officer. A man named Charles Southall. Now it has started. Hello, I'm Charles Southall. NSA is an American Intelligence Organization. I was a naval officer. They are basically spying on the whole world. I was home with my young family, and received a telephone call, saying... "You really should come out to the station around midnight, because something interesting is going to happen." And, shortly after midnight... a recording came through... from somewhere down in Africa. I don't remember where it came from, and I probably didn't even know at the time. But, one of the watch supervisors commented that, "This is history, and it's only seven minutes old." And it was the recording of a man that we were aware of. A Belgian mercenary pilot... who we called "The Lone Ranger". He apparently was up in a Fouga Magister. He said, "I see a transport coming in low." I'm going down to take a look at it." And he said, "I'm gonna make a run on it." And then you could hear, and this was really chilling, you could hear the gun cannon firing. "Rattattat." And he said, "I've hit it. "There are flames coming out of it." And quite quickly he said, "It's crashed." And that was the end of the recording. And we processed this recording, and sent it off to Washington. And we all went home then. At the time we heard this recording, I did not know... this was the aircraft that was transporting Dag Hammarskjold and his staff and his personal security people. Here you can see the control tower. So, this spot... it must be just down here. - Just down there, actually. - Yeah. My big ambition is to bring it up. All of it has to come up? Yes, because of new technology... Now we only have two shovels? - First, I have to find it. - Okay. Because of new technology, if you can reexamine the wreckage... it is possible to say, was there explosives involved? We will come back in the morning, with the metal detector, and then we will try to sweep, to see if there's anything there. Probably around somewhere there. Yeah, it must be somewhere there. Yeah, it's very close here. There were never taken any so called in situ pictures of Dag Hammarskjold's body. Pictures of the body as it looked like when it was found at the crash site. The first pictures were taken after he had been moved onto a stretcher. And here, in the shirt collar of Dag Hammarskjold, a playing card can be seen. And by the way, this playing card is not mentioned in the autopsy report. But, you may ask, what kind of playing card was it? The first civilian photographer admitted to the crash site, a man named Norman Kenward, claims to know the answer. Yes, I was the local photographer. And in the early afternoon, I would say early afternoon, I received a telephone call... asking me, if I had heard anything about the Dag Hammarskjold plane crashing. - Who was it calling you? - A police officer. He said to me, "My advice to you is, have your cameras ready", and with that, I immediately jumped in the car, with no other assistants with me, and I raced towards Ndola. How many days did it take to find his body? - It took 15 hours. - Fifteen hours? Yes. But it crashed eight miles from the airport. And there was a big fire, you know? I went there with my friend. But still there was a very big fire in the morning. - Yeah - So, it must have been easy to see. As I arrived at the crash site, I parked my car and got the equipment I needed, my camera, Rolleiflex camera. As I walked along the track, to the left of me was a pile of bodies. All right? I casually said to one of the persons there, I said, "Oh! What's going on?" Oh, he said, "We're putting Hammarskjold into the ambulance." You know, it's complicated, because, when they found his body at the crash site... It's a very mysterious story. When they found his body at the crash site... - Yeah? - ...all the other passengers, most of them, they were totally burned, - Okay. - ...and in bits and pieces, - all over the place. - Yeah. But Hammarskjold, he was just lying on the ground, - you know, like this... - Yes. ...remarkably undamaged. Okay, he was lying like that? Yes. And then comes the most important detail. So, a few days later, you meet the exact same police officer - in the street? - Correct. And you have a conversation, which you choose to keep secret - for a great many years. - Yes. And he said, "Oh, by the way." He said, "Did you hear about Hammarskjold?" I said, "Well, you know, I believe, he was dead, or died", or whatever. He said, "Did you see him up close?" I said, "No, I did not." He said, "Well, between you and me, rumor, and I'll say rumor, has it, he had the death card in his collar." So, I said, "A death card? The ace of spades?" He said, "Yes." I said, "My goodness, you know, what a... coincidence sort of thing." You know. "By the way," he said, "Please, Norman, don't mention that to anyone." He says, "After all, it's not released officially to anyone." Well, there's nothing here. No. - That's interesting. - Yeah, what was that? Yeah, I mean... That would actually fit with the map. If the burial spot is there, it should make a sound there, and not over here. So, yes, that makes sense. See? So, just to be 100 percent sure, should we check out the other place? Can you read that sentence to me? Yeah. Um, "In September 2013, the story moved beyond the realm of conspiracy theory for the senior citizens." Yes, because it's only old people who remembers Dag Hammarskjold. - Okay. - Now, what happened is, they have a press conference in The Peace Palace, where a commission of jurists... - Yeah. - ...who have been investigating the case, presents their conclusions. The commission will present the report on its inquiry into the cause of death of the former Secretary General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjold, in 1961. The purpose of the report is to evaluate the new body of evidence uncovered about the death of Dag Hammarskjold. Not least, thanks to the work of Goran Bjorkdahl. I may say, Mr. Bjorkdahl, we have been very much assisted by the research that you have made available to us. - Thanks. - The commission had asked the U.S. National Security Agency, the NSA, if they had any records in their archives matching the description of intercepted radio traffic given by former NSA officer Charles Southall. The archive's response, as we record in section 15.12, has been that of three documents, or records, which appear to respond to our request, two are classified top secret, on national security grounds. "Yes, we have the records you are looking for, but you cannot have them." But even more interesting is the question of whether a bomb had been planted in Dag Hammarskjold's plane. When the UN did their first investigation of the crash, back in 1962, it was discovered that Dag Hammarskjold's plane, the Albertina, had been left completely unguarded at the airport for at least two hours before takeoff, which would make it possible for a determined person to plant a bomb inside the plane. But, as the investigators wrote at the time, "This is no more than a theory, not even supported by circumstantial evidence." "What, nevertheless, lends apparent substance to the bomb theory, is the batch of documents, pertinently originating through a body called The South African Institute for Marine Research." "Maritime Research"? "Maritime Research." So, now, we are going to South Africa. Are you going to talk about the deeper story? - About what? - About what happened there? - About apartheid? - Yes. Yes. - Because, you know, in 1998... - Yeah? ...The Truth and Reconciliation Commission... - Mm-hmm. - ...they are closing down. In August 1998, having spent more than four years investigating the crimes of the apartheid regime, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was closing down. To mark the end of their work, they held a final press conference in Cape Town, chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. It is a very special moment... for all of us. We have discovered, in the course of our investigation, documents reporting to be from an institution called "The South African Institute of Maritime Research"... discussing the sabotage of the aircraft in which the United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold died on the night of September 18, 1961. Has everybody got a copy of these secret documents from the Institute of Maritime Research? How many are missing? The documents come from, allegedly, from a shadowy private... paramilitary intelligence organization, known as The South African Maritime Research Institute. And they are... the manuscript for killing Dag Hammarskjold. The full set of documents, discovered in the vaults of South Africa's secret service, was said to consist of 12 pages, but the originals have since vanished in South African state archives. What remains are blurred photocopies of nine pages, outlining a plot to kill Dag Hammarskjold with a bomb. The documents say that Hammarskjold had to be removed because the United Nations had become "troublesome". Among the conspirators, British Intelligence is mentioned, as well as the American Intelligence Service, the CIA. Do you know whether the Institute still exists? Yes, in fact, when we got these documents, which was about... a few months ago. The first thing that we did, was to send an investigator to establish whether in fact there is an institute of this nature. We are of the view that there is an institute, though in a different form, or a slightly different form. But, none of the journalists went to look for the institute themselves. Maybe because, the British foreign office, as well as the CIA, quickly scrambled to bury the story as a piece of cold war misinformation, planted by the Russians. As a result, The South African Institute for Maritime Research, or in short, SAIMR, remains mostly uncharted territory. It is not impossible that the account carried by these documents is genuine, but it is just as possible that they are a well-informed fabrication. - Are you talking? - No. Now I will be dictating. Dictating. Okay. What little we know about SAIMR today, is thanks to the South African journalist, De Wet Potgieter. Back in the early 90s, he met with a man who claimed to be the Commodore of SAIMR. A man named Keith Maxwell. He described himself as commander of the SAIMR's military unit, Delta. And... what he told me... He said that... the unit is a successor of a 184-year old organization, first formed by a group of British mariners. Preferring to remain anonymous... the group's interests are diverse. Some orders come from London, and others are initiated here in South Africa. De Wet Potgieter... takes the only photo known to me of Maxwell. This is him. The leader of SAIMR. The Commodore. You see how he is dressed in white? White, he is. I think because... SAIMR was a maritime organization... So they claim to be. But Maxwell was also... posing as a doctor. In some quarters, he referred to himself as Dr. Maxwell Annandale. But he was not a medical doctor, or any doctor of any sort. And from what I've gathered when I've seen the surgery, there were black women lying on beds with funny machines making beep sounds, and he was experimenting on black people. - Maxwell is dead now. - Yeah. But, while being there, I managed to... - find the widow of Maxwell. - Yes. - Her name is Diane... - Mm-hmm. ...and I speak with her on the phone while I'm driving around during night time on the highways of Johannesburg. My marriage was very difficult. That's the way it is. It became very difficult for me. And I don't enjoy... the past being brought up, actually. Can I ask, were you afraid of Keith? Was he abusive? Not physically, no. Verbally, mentally, maybe. Yes. Did he ever mention the former United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold? I think he might have mentioned it, once or twice, maybe. But he didn't say much. He just said that this chap had died. And that was about it. Do you know anything about SAIMR? The South African Maritime Research Institute? Did he share any information with you about that? It was the organization that my husband set up for some reason or other, yes. But what did he tell you that the organization was about? - What it was about? - Yeah? He just set it up, but, I don't know why he set it up. If you want my frank opinion, I think my husband was probably a little bit mentally ill. Uh, yeah. At the end, I think he was mentally ill. I thought, he was just playing games. And he used to play games, but, yeah. Playing with other people's minds, to see what that would do. And she tells me some very disturbing things - about Maxwell. - Okay. How he liked to... manipulate other people, play with their minds. Hmm. - How abusive and evil he was. - He was, yeah. - How evil was he? - Well, you know what he did? No? He was running a number of clinics - in the black townships... - Yes. ...pretending to be a medical doctor. Surname Maxwell Annandale. Yeah. The surgery where De Wet Potgieter met Keith Maxwell in the early 90s, is now gone. Keith Maxwell Annandale, or Keith Annandale, or Keith Maxwell Annandale, as a double-barreled surname. Yeah. But they said the name as Keith Maxwell. Keith Maxwell Annandale. But Potgieter discovers that Maxwell had more than one surgery. Is the old lady, is she inside here? Keith Maxwell Annandale? Oh, yeah. Was he a doctor or something? - Yes, exactly. - Yeah, he had a place down the road there, but, it used to be the old post office. - Oh, he had the surgery here? - That's correct. - Oh, that's interesting. - Was he wearing - a white safari suit? - That's correct. We discovered that he was running a number of clinics in the townships around Johannesburg... Mm-hmm. ...offering medical assistance to black people at a very low cost. Here! This. Oh, yeah. We even have the name. There's it. - Yeah, exactly. - Come stand here. "Dr. Maxwell." There's it. And, at that point in time, Goran and I, we... we had difficulties finding out what these clinics were about. Why was he running these clinics? And people we talk to, tell us about how he was experimenting on black people. I could just find his car in the whole... - That's his car there. - Oh, that's his car. The clients who came here, did they seem to be satisfied with the treatment they got? - No, no, no. - They were not? He was more of a chancer. You know, because I used to sit with him and see what he'd do. You know. - Quack? - Yes, he was a quack. He made his money out of this. He had a drum there and put them in a drum and rolled them in the drum. He gave them false injections, you know? He gave injections to them also? - Yes. - He was a surgeon. - Surgeon? - Yeah, as a surgeon. When you came here... Plenty of people sitting outside waiting for the doctor. I know his name, because at home, I think I got... - Was it Dr. Maxwell? - Yeah. - Was it Dr. Maxwell? - Yeah. He was an old man. He put it on the machine. Flex your hands. There was a mystery about him, you know? Minding his own little things, you know? And apparently he was very quiet. Oh. very, very quiet. But, a sharpshooter. Sharpshooter, yes. Yeah, they came to rob him. And he shot one or two guys dead. He was very good at firearms. Even before he shot somebody. He was an expert in guns. Of course, he was a mercenary. You know? - He was a mercenary? He said that? - Yeah. - He said that? - Yeah, he used to... He was hired to go to the Congo and all those African countries. Did ever talk about a man named Dag Hammarskjold? Dag Hammarskjold? Nothing come into my mind. Maxwell and Potgieter met several times. Maxwell fed Potgieter lots of documents from the files of SAIMR, amongst them, the first part of a fictionalized account of Maxwell's life, entitled "The Story of My Life". There you are. It's the story of Maxwell's life, but fictionalized. It tells how, as a young man, Maxwell is recruited into SAIMR, in the memoir simply called "the Marine Institute". At a farm outside of Johannesburg, Maxwell is being trained with other SAIMR cadets, all dressed in whites. They are given lessons in psychological warfare and the dark arts in general. Maxwell's handler in SAIMR is a strict and stern officer named Robert Wagman. At the end of Maxwell's training, Commander Wagman sends him to the Congo on a clandestine mission for the Marine Institute. In the Congo, Maxwell ends up at a secret jungle laboratory, funded and operated by the U.S. Army. Here, research is being done into biological warfare and how to weaponize viruses. Finally, Keith Maxwell, who calls himself "Ken Marshall" in his memoir, has a fallout with the commander of the jungle laboratory, who expels Maxwell from the premises. Maxwell then travels to the capital of the Congo, stays at Hotel Memling for a while, and then goes back to South Africa. Here the memoir breaks off, unfinished. Not a word is written about Dag Hammarskjold and how he died in September 1961. I'm a bit confused, because, there are a lot of names, and a lot of people that are mentioned here. It is a very complicated story. - Hmm. - Maybe too complicated. The reason for making it complicated is, of course, the nine secret documents released by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission back in 1998, outlining a conspiracy to kill Dag Hammarskjold. "The code name for the operation to kill Dag Hammarskjold was Operation Celeste." Today, 20 years later, the Operation Celeste papers from SAIMR remain a complete mystery. No one knows who wrote them, nor why or when. If the documents are to be trusted as genuine, it is first and foremost necessary to prove that SAIMR did exist as a real organization. The best way to do this, would be to find other members of SAIMR besides Keith Maxwell. Because, in theory, all of this could be an elaborate hoax embedded in reality by Keith Maxwell. The Operation Celeste papers mention a secret agent code named "Congo Red", who works for SAIMR in the Congo. They also tell how the explosives for the bomb to kill Dag Hammarskjold were provided by the Belgian mining corporation, Union Minière. The bomb fails to explode at takeoff, but the agent Congo Red writes that a contingency plan was activated. "An 'eagle' is being dispatched." Most likely a reference to a jet fighter, and just as Dag Hammarskjold's plane is about to land at Ndola airport, the plane crashes, and he dies. And, in the end, Congo Red confirms the job has been done. Besides Congo Red, we have an agent for the CIA, code named "Dwight". He is to meet his liaison from SAIMR at the old Leopold II Hotel in the capital of Katanga, today the Park Hotel. There is no trace left of Dwight having stayed at the Hotel in 1961. The only real names given in the Operation Celeste papers are names of senior SAIMR officers. We have a Commodore R. Wagner. Probably the same person as Commander Robert Wagman, the officer who was in charge of the Marine Institute in Maxwell's memoir. This man seems to be impossible to track down, and so are Dr. Pike and Captain Ian Kerr. Oh, man... So, the only confirmed member of SAIMR so far is, Keith Maxwell. But there could be other members of SAIMR. I did manage to find this article, which was published in theSunday Times Magazine in South Africa in 1989. Here, a young woman named Debbie Campbell, talks about how she works for SAIMR and Dr. Keith Maxwell. Debbie talks about how she was recruited into SAIMR out of school when she was only 13, and how she now does research at Maxwell's AIDS clinic. But Debbie Campbell seems to have vanished from the face of the earth. My quest to track her down has been in vain, and the journalist who wrote the article claims she has forgotten all about it. Luckily, there are other names to work on. In the trove of SAIMR documents which Keith Maxwell handed over to journalist De Wet Potgieter, several people are mentioned, including a South African doctor named Claude Newbury. Good afternoon. Hello, Mr. Newbury. Yes. Hello. I am Mads Brugger. I am a journalist from Denmark. - How do you do? - Fine, thank you. And this is Goran Bjorkdahl, whom you spoke with before. - Yes. We spoke on the phone. - How do you do? I'm interested, how did you guys get my mobile number? Dr. Newbury, who is known in South Africa as a prolife, anti-abortion campaigner, confirms having befriended Keith Maxwell. He was a very pleasant person and very humorous. He was the sort of person who made lots and lots of jokes, you know, he could make a joke easily. One evening... we were invited to dinner, and he said, "Well... would you like to become a member of SAIMR?" So I said, "What does it entail?" And it seemed to entail only the investigation, the research into sunken treasure. Please, go on. What happens that evening? There was a little bit of a ceremony. He had been dressed up like an admiral in the British Navy from about 250 years ago. You know, with the... tricorne hat and a cutlass and a naval uniform with lots of buttons, and that was it. - Who was wearing that? - That was Mr. Maxwell. - He was dressed like that? - Yes. Yes. And then, at a later stage, he asked me what I thought about the AIDS virus. And what did he tell you? Well, he indicated that he thought it was a product of biological warfare. In fact, Keith Maxwell, was obsessed with AIDS, writing extensively about how SAIMR was doing research into the HIV virus, and the possibility of using the virus as a weapon to kill black people. Sorry, Mads, would you tell me, was he infected with AIDS? - Who, Maxwell? - Maxwell, - yeah. No. - No. No, but he was interested in... using AIDS to kill black people. In his master plan, Keith Maxwell writes about how AIDS will play an important role in South Africa's political future. "As refugees from the disease pour into South Africa from the north, they will bring the virus with them, and the black population with whom they mingle will become infected on a large scale." "As a result..." Maxwell concludes, South Africa will have "A white majority in the year 2000." That's not the person that I know. Maxwell was trying to discover a cure for the HIV virus. He wanted me at one time to join, or to start a clinic in a building out in Benoni where he had visualized a... How do I say? A medical clinic. Now, he wasn't a medical doctor, and I am a medical doctor. And when I said to him, no, I wasn't prepared to do that, he seemed to be very upset with me, and that was the end of our relationship. Another person mentioned in the SAIMR documents is a man named René Goor. According to the documents, he was second in command in the South African Institute for Maritime Research, working directly under Commodore Keith Maxwell in the early 90s. "Goran and I went to visit him." Yes. And you know what happens? He comes out of the building. We ask him if he is René Goor, who was in charge of SAIMR, second in command after Maxwell. - Hmm. - He says, "Absolutely not." He has never been involved with SAIMR. Then, we show him some SAIMR documents with the signature of René Goor. I mean, here we have a document... Yeah. - ...signed by René Goor. - That is my signature. - It is yours? - Yeah. Okay. - So, how can we explain that? - I don't know. - How is that possible? - Well, work it out. And we ask, how come? And then he says he is the victim of identity theft. But have they used that identity theft, you know, for taking out bank loans - or buying cars? - No, nothing. Only for this? - Yeah. It appears to be. - But that is bizarre. Yeah. It is bizarre. Do you know a man named René Goor? Yes, I used to know him, I haven't seen him for many, many years. Was he a friend of Keith? I think they were in acting classes together. They did drama. - They did drama? - Acting classes. Yeah, you know. Put on plays and stuff... You know, we are just trying to find out what kind of organization SAIMR was, and what they were doing. We don't try to incriminate anybody. So, we just... - Yeah. I don't know. - ...try to get the information about SAIMR. We also spoke to a source who said that you did... drama classes together with Keith Maxwell. - I did do drama classes. Yes. - Really? - Yes. - What year? I can't remember. Before the 90s? - Wasn't that with Keith Maxwell? - I can't remember. You weren't a close friend to Keith Maxwell? - No. - What kind of drama was it? What kind of... - Nothing serious. - Was it like Shakespeare? - No, not at all. - Was it improv? Improvisation. Yeah. That handwriting under the signature... is that yours? - This handwriting here. - That is my handwriting. - It is your handwriting? - Yeah. It is my handwriting. So, It's also you writing "Lieutenant commander"? No. Not me, but it is my handwriting. That is my handwriting, but I don't know this document. Why on earth would Keith Maxwell and his cohorts... Yeah. ...go to this length with stealing your identity? I don't know, because, I don't know the background of this organization. I don't know what they were up to. Really, I have no idea. The SAIMR papers also mention a South African General named Tienie Groenewald. "Tienie Groenewald, former General and Chief Director of Military Intelligence, former Air Attaché at the South African Embassy in London." And coming back... at a particular time he came back, and he sort of became the chief of Military Intelligence. So, since then, he has been involved in intelligence work, military Intelligence, all his life. Goran and I, we go to visit Groenewald. And Groenewald tells us that he met two times with Maxwell. He was neatly dressed, he was well spoken. He appeared to be someone who... who was in authority. He even has Maxwell's name written in his calendar. Maxwell comes to meet Groenewald, and tells him if he is interested in... Before apartheid? No, just before apartheid ends. - Yes. - In the last days of apartheid. Yes. Maxwell comes to meet Groenewald and tells him if he wants weapons and money for arming white people... - to go up against black people... - Black people. - ...like a civil war... - Okay. ...Maxwell can help him. He had the resources... to... to use violence, and to supply weapons and so on and so forth. But I was convinced that... he was financed and directed by MI6 of British Intelligence. How? After spending three and a half years in Britain, you get to know some people involved in the intelligence field. And certain names which are mentioned in our discussion was familiar to him. Which told me, well, obviously, he knows these people. So, Groenewald... was convinced that Maxwell was working for MI6, British Intelligence. And because of that, he told him no. And... they never meet again. That is very interesting. What is also interesting, is that I ask Groenewald if he has ever heard about SAIMR, South African Maritime Research Institute, and Groenewald says, "Never." No. I can't see... this organization as really playing a significant part. If they did, I would have known about it. You have the Operation Celeste papers, - right, Goran? - Some of them, yes. - They are here. - Could you show them to the General? - Just to get his, you know... - Yeah. Yes, of course. I don't know if you have seen these particular papers. But, this is, I think, four documents. Here is one giving some orders. You see. My question always is, is this authentic, or is this... Did they try and create an impression... that the CIA, for example, was involved? Because it is very easy to do this. Let me say... that you would be very, very careful, if the CIA was involved, of putting something like this on paper. If you do, then it's highly... It's not professional. Not professional at all. I don't even know what to think. But if it was something real... wouldn't this person, who was the commander of the military... like, um... know anything about it? Exactly. "How come Groenewald had never heard about SAIMR?" Sorry, did you finish the story? Are we done? - About SAIMR? - Yeah. - About Maxwell and... - Yes, for now, because we come back to... We go back to - We come back to South Africa later. Okay, yeah. Okay. So, this camera guy was standing somewhere there, and they took it that way. You still have the road here... No, but listen, it is here! I'm getting a massive reading! Yeah. - It is here! - Yeah. It's here. - You found it. - It is freaking out! Yeah. We found it. Yeah, so we found the spot. The question is, how deep down is it? That's the question. You can see on the photos. it's... I mean, it's... - three, four meters. - Deep. - According to this. - Yeah. - Can we do some digging here? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yes. Now, something very interesting happens. It's April 2014. - Yes. - A cable sent from U.S. Ambassador to the Congo, Ed Gullion... - Yeah. - ...on 18th September 1961, is declassified. The cable from Ambassador Ed Gullion to U.S. State Department was transmitted hours before the crash site was located officially. The Ambassador informs that Hammarskjold's plane may have been shot down by a Belgian mercenary pilot, identified by a "Usually reliable source" as, "Van Riesseghel". He misspells the name a little bit, but it's Jan van Risseghem... a Belgian mercenary pilot. Here, Risseghem is seen in his Fouga Magister 93, the jet fighter most likely to have been used for attacking Dag Hammarskjold's plane. The only problem is, Jan van Risseghem is dead. In Spain, we meet former Belgian paratrooper, Pierre Coppens, who was a friend of Risseghem. I met Jan van Risseghem in 1965. He was the pilot of the National Parachutism Center in Moorsele. And gradually, Risseghem tells Coppens that he was the one who attacked Dag Hammarskjold's plane. He explained me that the distance was too long, so, I mean, he can arrive to the destination, but he cannot come back. And from where did he take off? Kipushi. - Kipushi? - Yes. Kipushi. So, this is... the old Kipushi airfield. What he say that, "I take off from in the jungle, so I'm in the bush... - Yes. - ...on a runway who was made... by the bulldozers from the Union Minière." So, later on, people have taken the pavement, which was made from gravel from the mine. They had the gravel, levelled, but people have taken it. But then, he explained me another thing that nobody knows. This is where we believe van Risseghem took off in his Fouga Magister... - 17th September 1961? - Yeah. We believe he was capable. It was not normally long enough for a jet plane, but he had a special technique, you know, for... ...when taking off and landing with the plane. He make a small tank but he put down... I believe he put under this tank down the airplane or on the wings. He attached an extra gasoline tank to the plane. He said, "Then I have more reserve for starting... because I push, I push a lot of power... - Yes. - ...to take off." Yes. Hold it there! So... it's night, van Risseghem flies his Fouga to Ndola, and there he intercepts Hammarskjold's plane? - Yes. - Okay. - Was it a small or a big plane? - A small plane. The plane was taking the glide... - Yes. - ...to land, no, with full lights. - Hammarskjold's plane? - Yes. - Yes. - And he say, "I arrived from the back." I just from the back I arrive. And so he shot. And did he say where on the airplane he shot? We saw the fire around there. On top of the plane. On the left wing. We just saw the flash from the sky. Yes, because of the wing tanks. When you have ammunition which is explosive... you just shoot on the wing, and it will explode. It began to burn, and then it crashed. This is, in fact, a picture of the person who basically killed Dag Hammarskjold. Yes. Yes. But did van Risseghem feel any kind of remorse, any... - No. - No? No. - Nothing? - No, no. Did he tell you who gave him the order - to bring down the plane? - No. But what is interesting is, we also learned that Risseghem was Belgian and British. And during the war, he worked for the Royal Air Force, specializing in night-time operations. And his code name was "The Lone Ranger". "The Lone Ranger" was his name in England. - In the World War II. - Oh. Because he was flying with a Hawker Hurricane, always night time, and always alone. - Interesting. - So he was known as "The Lone Ranger"? - Yes. - Yes. And it was a man that we were aware of. A Belgian mercenary pilot who we called "The Lone Ranger". Was it your impression that in army circles, mercenary circles... that people knew that van Risseghem was the one who brought down Hammarskjold's plane? In Brussels, yes. When some people talked about van Risseghem, I said, "Ah, everybody knows that he shot down this plane." It was common knowledge? - Yes. - But how come that nobody has spoken to the press... the media, about it? This is a copy of Jan van Risseghem's pilot logbook from his time in the Congo. The only period not accounted for, in the logbook are the days shortly before and after the death of Dag Hammarskjold. Furthermore, the one writing in his pilot logbook is his wife, Marion. So, you know, how is that to be trusted? What is that? Why are you filming? Hello, Ms. Van Risseghem? My name is Mads Brugger. I'm a journalist from Denmark. Clearly, what is all this about? Well, it's about... This is Goran Bjorkdahl. - He's from Sweden. - Hello. No! Not this Hammarskjold thing again! It's Hammarskjold... Do you have just like two minutes? I just need to ask you a very important question. Oh. Then, soon after, Goran... "The UN appoints... an expert panel of three persons." Acting on the report from the commission of jurists, the UN appoints a three-person expert panel, tasked with evaluating the new body of evidence in the Dag Hammarskjold crash. And they learn about Goran's metal plate. Remember? The one with the little holes. This is a part of... The plane? - Probably a part of the plane, yes. - For real? That's awesome, so it's a part of history. Yes. Well... The UN has appointed a panel of experts who are going to investigate if he was murdered. I'm going to give the plate to them tonight. They will investigate, if it really was a part of the plane. It's almost certain it is. And they come to Stockholm to meet with Goran, and he hands over the metal plate. We are hoping, of course, that this metal plate is the smoking gun. Nice to meet you. It's a bit like in films, when people have to dig their own grave. I just need a timeout, Goran. I'm about to be throwing up. Oh, Jesus. Can I give a hand? - Goran, did you have the gel? - Yes. Because I'm having blisters. If they are broken, you know, it may be good to clean them. It hurts a lot. It hurts a lot. There you go. Saphir, you remember I told you... Goran met with the three man expert panel in Sweden? Yeah. They took the metal plate to FBI laboratories in... - the USA... - Yeah. and they tested the plate... and the conclusion was... the plate has zero probative value. It has never been inside a plane, it probably comes from a Land Rover, and the holes in it... does not come from ammunition. - Okay. - You understand? Yeah. It's bad news for Goran. Amazingly, we are given permission to start digging inside the airport. But then, suddenly, someone calls from Lusaka... and tells the airport to stop this. They don't want us to be digging for the wreckage. Okay. So you know, all so close, but no cigar. Permission has to come from somewhere else. I, you know... My principle is that it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. - No, no, no. - No? Okay. No, in the airport, no. In the airport, it's better to ask for permission than forgiveness. Isn't that a bit too early? It's never too early for cigars, Goran. - You're shaking. - Yeah. All the... all the activities with looking for the wreckage has really gone to my nerves. I thought you were a cool man, Mads? No, but, you know... You know the feeling you have, when you're really close to something, but... then you are further away than ever before? Is that the reason this story is still a mystery? - What? - The reason why it became also fiction? It's not... - This is not fiction. - Okay. - This is a documentary. - A documentary? All right. But... To be honest, I was never really interested in the legacy of Dag Hammarskjold. Because, at the end of the day, most people have never heard about Dag Hammarskjold. And when you get to see him, he comes across as a goofy character from a screwball comedy. The explanation is a very simple one. For me, Dag Hammarskjold was most of all a ticket to all the things I really enjoy. Tracking down Belgian mercenaries, telling tales of evil men who dress in white. The ace of spades found at crime scenes. Rumors about secret African societies. That is why I went along for the ride, not really knowing where it would lead. For six years, Goran and I, worked the murder case. We travelled all over Africa and Europe, roaming around in archives and conducting enormous amounts of interviews with elderly white, liver-spotted men. We did have a few wins along the way. In the archives of a former British spy, we discovered a never before seen telex, from the rebel leader of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, to the Prime Minister of the British Protectorate, Rhodesia. Here, Tshombe asks for having two fighter jets delivered immediately. The telex is dated the day before Hammarskjold was to come to Ndola for peace talks with Tshombe. But no one knows if the fighter jets were ever delivered. And, not to forget, we found this never before published picture of Hammarskjold's plane after the crash. It shows a big hole in the tail fin. But, when all is said and done, it's just a hole and, who knows? So, I began looking for a way out, because one thing I do care about is my own legacy. It's because when they found Hammarskjold's body... he had a playing card in his shirt collar. And... I met a man who told me that... he was at the crash site that the playing card sitting in his shirt collar was the ace of spades. If Goran Bjorkdahl and I, did not manage to crack open the case, I would employ all the old tricks of my trade. Costume play and role play. Pith helmets and dressing up like Dr. Maxwell. This is also why I hatched the idea about employing not only one... but two African secretaries, hoping they would somehow save my shipwrecked film with their mere presence. If you ask me, why two secretaries, not one? - Are we rolling? - Yes. I cannot explain it. So, Clarinah, where were we? It was an experiment. In short, I was hoping this charade would cover up my failures as a journalist. But instead, something much worse happened. All my fantasies came true. To be more precise, unknowingly, Goran Bjorkdahl and I, were on the verge of discovering a kind of horror which would put all my shenanigans to shame. There are still some question marks here. There's a lot of question marks, Goran. Yeah. I think one of us have to go back to South Africa to... study SAIMR more. To really... You know, get to the heart of the matter. You have a list in front of you? - Yes. - What kind of list is that? That is a list of people who responded to an advert that Keith Maxwell put out in 1989, when he was looking for mercenaries... and could be willing to sign up for a... military operation in Africa. - For SAIMR? - For SAIMR, yes. We have this long list of names, and we are basically going through all the names, trying to find their phone numbers. Yeah? I am calling because of a list of men who responded to adverts from a group known as SAIMR. Yes. I believe you are one of them. Yes. What can you tell me about this group? Well, we cannot talk about it yet. It's a bit dangerous. So, we are not too keen on talking about things. My own involvement in... the forces that'd be at the time and the implications thereof, and what we had to do and get up to. Well, you know... I don't know if I am willing to divulge anything on that. Okay. But can you at least confirm that SAIMR was real? That it did exist at one point in time? I can't... I'm not at the liberty of speaking about it, Sir. What I did, I did. And what I did, as far as I'm concerned, I was doing the right thing. And yeah. We'll leave it at that. You must find other people that are maybe willing to discuss it, because I am definitely not. Where did you get my number from? It's not open to the public. Yeah, since most of these people have shown to be unwilling to speak on the phone, we will just, you know, go to their houses and try to approach them, you know. Some may just tell us to fuck off, and others may be willing to talk. Goran and I, we... find the street address... corresponding to one of the names, a man named Clive. Are you speaking about the Maritime Research? Are you speaking of that, are you? - Yes. - Yes. Oh, I know, I done training with them - for about three months. - Three months? And then, afterwards, everything went basically quiet. Okay? I can try and look. I know, I've got a certificate that I was issued with. - From the Maritime... - You do? You have that? I've got a certificate. Could you find that for us? - That would be a great help. - Yes. I can find it for you. Here we go. This was 1993. - Incredible. - Is it '93? - It is the real deal. - Can I take a quick look? He went to a secret SAIMR training camp... - Mm-hmm. - ...outside Johannesburg, where they were wearing white clothes. I know, Clive, it's a long time ago, but can you recollect... names of anybody in charge of SAIMR when you were there? There was one guy from the NCIS, whatever, the Intelligence Bureau, I remember. - And there was an American guy. - An American guy? Curly hair, black hair, with a mustache. The American guy is Robert Cedars. His résumé reads like a real-life Rambo. Ex-Green Beret. Ex-mercenary. He has worked for the Anglo-American Mining Corporation and the King of Afghanistan. And among his listed interests are parapsychology and rock 'n' roll. Do you remember a man named Keith Maxwell? I met him a few times. He was supposed to organize us as a security guard. But I don't know. They were supposed to hire me to... train people. But, shit, they never did nothing. I don't think they went anywhere or did anything. So, I don't know what the hell they did. I couldn't be bothered with this. So, anyway, good luck with whatever you're looking for. Find out who killed President Kennedy, do something important. Okay, so, in '93, we have you on a farm - here in Johannesburg... - Yes. ...training together with Bob Cedars and Maxwell. - Dressing in whites? - Whites. Yeah. The naval shirt, white pants... There wasn't any firearms given to us or anything. It was more lectures and that kind of stuff. It was based on normal military co-ops. Perfect. Fascinating. Then, Goran and I called another name of the list, a man named Alexander Jones. - Hello. - Yes, hello, Mr. Jones? Yes. And when we phone him, I simply ask him... Did you ever hear anybody discuss Dag Hammarskjold while you were active in SAIMR? I see, now it's starting to get... Now I'm starting to get uncomfortable with the questioning. And... Soon after, we meet with him. And he is the guy we have been looking for... for six years. So, simply put, what is SAIMR? SAIMR was a clandestine mercenary... organization for hire. Financed by whom? Financed by foreign governments. And what was the purpose of SAIMR? SAIMR was there to go and... destabilize certain countries. And... No, basically... we were soldiers. And what was your role, specifically? Were you in the front lines, so to speak? Yes, I was definitely in the front line. Operational front line. Hand-to-hand front line. Fighting front line. Leading operations, if you want to call it that. Did you kill people yourself? Yes. Is it dangerous for you talking to us about this? Definitely. Very. I mean... I could get backlash from my own people. You're sitting with a list of names... and all of those names on that list... are... can be verified. But why are you taking that risk, may I ask? I think it's about time that we need closure. I need personal closure. Basically, this is... operational... headquarters for SAIMR. You should still be able to see reminiscences of military personnel here. For example... Oh, we can go. There is the barracks down that side. How many people did it involve? SAIMR? Anything from... - 5,000 people upwards. - That many? That many. So SAIMR was a big organization. In front of us now, would have been your main hall, which would've been your mess hall and your gathering place. Look... SAIMR was very clever in the way that they operated. You and I could be sitting in the same room, and you could belong to the medical division of SAIMR and I wouldn't know you from a bar of soap. There would be... dinners... formal dinners, you know, depends on celebrating different occasions in the history of SAIMR. That type of stuff. Maxwell would come there in his old 18th century - commodore's uniform. - Really? - Yeah. - Like a Lord Nelson? That's right. Yeah. With a hat... Everything. With a sword. Look, they were very sucker to the 1800's... British naval traditions and attire. Especially the hierarchy. We wore normal whites. This a picture of... - Maxwell. - Yes. - Yes. - He was looking like that? Yes. That's exactly what Commodore Maxwell looked like. Did he wear white all the time? All the time. I never ever saw him wear anything but white. - Always white? - Always white. This is Maxwell. Yeah. Very intelligent person. Very manipulative. He commanded respect. If you met him, you just couldn't help showing respect to the gentleman. - He was charismatic? - Very. But also very dangerous. Dangerous in what way? If he didn't like you and if you posed a threat to him, he would take you out. - He would simply kill you? - Yeah. - Himself? - By himself, yeah. And what kind of operations were you doing? Well, it was clandestine operations. We were involved in coups... taking over countries for other leaders. We were involved in Mozambique... spreading the AIDS virus through medical conditions. We were involved in Angola with Dr. Jonas Savimbi... for various operations. We gave military support. So, people were killed during these operations? Oh, definitely. - You mentioned... - Goran, can we... I'll just do the question again and then you can come in? Okay. You mentioned actively spreading AIDS? There was a unit from SAIMR. That... One of the things was that we went into... - African countries. - And how was that done, exactly? - Through inoculation. - Through vaccines? Yeah, through vaccines. Pretending to inoculate people and that type of thing. The idea being to kill black people? Yeah. To eradicate black people. You must understand, the concept was that AIDS was a killer. It was incurable at that point in time, so it was let to believe that if you infected people... it was "The quick..." "non-militaristic..." approach... to eliminate... black people. And that is something you know for a fact? That... AIDS was actively being spread to other countries? Yes. To African countries. Before we continue with Alexander Jones... I should tell you about the case of Dagmar Feil. - Isn't it beautiful? - It's fantastic! Like, home from home. Hey, Dagmar, smile for the camera. I happened to discover... a advert placed in a South African newspaper... from SAIMR... where they are looking for the killers of Dagmar Feil. And... We managed to find the brother of Dagmar Feil, Karl Feil. Shake it out. Shake the thing. My sister came to me and she said to me she needed to confide in me. She needed to sit with me. And... - Sorry, I just... - No worries. Of course. I have a lot of guilt about it, because... She actually sat with me and said to me, she thinks that they are going to kill her. - She told you that? - Yeah, and I said to her, who? And she said she doesn't know, but she thinks they're after her. And she said that they'd already killed three or four people in the same team that she was a part of. And I said what team? And she said she couldn't tell me. The other thing she said is, she needs to come to church with me. She needs to make right with God. She fully expects to be dead within the next couple of weeks. His sister, Dagmar, was recruited into SAIMR. She had a background as a marine biologist. So I believe you got your matric results? I mean university? University results. Yeah. - How did it go? - It was very good. What do you mean by "Good"? - Well, I passed. - How well did you pass? She did mention... in no particular detail, that... what she'd studied was particularly helpful in the work that she was doing then. In other words, the research element of what she did in marine biology was being... she was using on a daily basis in this particular role. But what I found very peculiar, is that she had a regular office job, working as a secretary and admin assistant in Johannesburg. But yet, she was doing all this research behind the scenes. But she never ever told me what it was. Was it like working in a laboratory? Yes. - In a laboratory? - Yes. - Clinical research? - Yes. - But where? - She never told me. The topic of AIDS research came up several times, quite loosely, in conversation. I never put two and two together. And she became a white supremacist. And she travelled to Mozambique and other African countries bordering with South Africa... to... bring vaccines... to people there. Countries such as Mozambique, Angola... Yes. Swaziland, Botswana came up several times. But she discovers that these vaccines from SAIMR are... contaminated, and she wants to tell... the police, the authorities, about what is going on. But before she manages to do so, she is murdered. And I dashed across Johannesburg and got to her apartment. and I found her white VW Beetle parked in front of the security gates of her flat. I found her lying in the street. Yeah. Sorry. Such a long time ago, and it is still a bit of a shock. - It's November 1990? - Yeah. Did the police investigate this... - murder? - No. They had absolutely no interest in pursuing the case at all. - Why? - I can't tell you. Then, we go to see Alexander Jones. We were at war. Black people in South Africa were the enemy. So it was about white supremacy? Definitely. Definitely trying to retain the white supremacy on the African continent. And furthermore, he tells us that the purpose of Maxwell's clinics in and around Johannesburg, was to infect black people with... HIV. He had the one in Thokoza. He had the one in Alex. Yes. If I'm not mistaken, there was one on the East or on the West Rand. And these were research facilities for them to inject people... with a "solution"... to say that they prevented AIDS in it. In the meantime, they were injecting people with AIDS. And he was only working on black people - in these clinics? - Yes. - For almost nothing? - Yeah. That's what I am saying. So, you know, what I mean... What easier way to get a big guinea pig? That you live in an apartheid system... Black people have got no rights. They need medical treatment. There's a... white "philanthropist" coming in and saying, "You know what? I'll open up these clinics and I'll treat you. I'll do..." this in the meantime, you're actually... the wolf in sheep's clothing. That's gruesome. Did you visit these clinics yourself? Yes. I went to the clinic in Alex, where there was the research facility. And there was monitors. There was tubes, there was... A proper lab. If you wanna say, a scientist's lab, you know, a proper, freaky scientist's lab. Definitely. Were there clinics also in other countries? Well, look... I know... Personally, that I know of. Our base of operation for this project was in Mozambique. - That I can tell you. - Where Dagmar Feil - was working? - Yes. He knew about Dagmar Feil and what she did. She was recruited to do medical research in Maxwell's labs. In Alexander. And then obviously she progressed and became a part of the inner circle for the operations, and she went to Mozambique to fulfill her... obligations. And... when it came... word got out that she was going to testify. She was going to inform the authorities about SAIMR... - Correct, yes. - ...and the spread of AIDS? That's right. And... I think it's well known in our circles that it was SAIMR themselves that took her out. But why would SAIMR place that advert? Why wouldn't they? - It's like a decoy? - Exactly. Another possible spin is, there was an interview published in South Africa with Maxwell and an ensign, a woman named Debbie. - She is the young lady? - Yes. - Yes. - And... Wait, she was at school, and they recruited her from school. Yes. We have tried to track her down, - but we can't find her. - No. I don't think she is around anymore. - You don't think she is alive anymore? - Yeah. Could that be Dagmar Feil? No, no, it's not that one. It's not. It's two different women. Her name is Debbie Campbell. - In the article, yes? - No, but Debbie is blonde. Would the South African... government, the apartheid regime, would they have known that SAIMR was spreading AIDS inside South Africa, and outside as well, to kill off black people? Highly likely. That's why I'm telling you. That's very... That's why people were killed for it. That's why Dagmar Feil was killed maybe? Yeah. That's why Dagmar was killed. You're wasting the champagne! You're wasting the champagne. And after the death of Dagmar, Dagmar's mother continues to investigate the case. She wants to find out who killed her daughter. She tried to give witness about the event to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They told her no, because it was too controversial. The murderers were never found. The case was not investigated. And they would not listen to her. In fact, I think, the second or third time that she went to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, they escorted her out. Just the mention of the South African Maritime Institute made people nervous. They would not listen at all. Then she befriends a SAIMR officer, I believe maybe it's Maxwell. Who feeds her information about SAIMR and her daughter. Yes. He approached my mum. I don't know whether it was out of guilt, or just a prick of his conscience. He contacted my mother and gave her a whole lot of documents. I believe they met several times. And in there are letterheads of the South African Maritime institute. So, this was the first time that I had ever heard of that institute. Not long after, we go to an address in Johannesburg, where the... personal belongings of Dagmar's mother are stored. She's dead now. Dagmar's mother. And... in her belongings we find an address book. Uh-oh. - What, Goran? - I found - an interesting name here. - What? Maxwell. "K. Maxwell". - You have Maxwell? - Yeah. What? Would they meet on a regular basis? Or... Most of it was telephonic. And then, at one stage, she was informed that he's going to Namibia. He's fleeing the country. He doesn't feel safe here. And he handed all of this documentation to her and she never heard from him again. Maxwell was fleeing to Namibia? The country of Namibia came up frequently, yes. - René Goor. - No? Here we have it. "Renée Goor." "Namibia." That's René Goor. He was in SAIMR. He was destined to take over from... Commodore Maxwell. Yes. And in that book... Dagmar's mother has made a... a number of notes. It says "Police", and then something has been crossed out. Then, there's part of a name... ending E-N-I-E. And then F-R-O-E-R... No. This is Groenewald. - It is? - It says "Tienie Groenewald". Wow. It says "Tienie Groenewald ordered Dagmar's murder - plus four others." - That's incredible. In a way, it would make sense. I mean, Tienie Groenewald, he was a key person... a top figure in the Military Intelligence. No. I can't see... this organization as really playing a significant part. If they did, I would have known about it. He is lying. All of South Africa knew about SAIMR. Everyone in the military field knew about SAIMR. The government knew about SAIMR. That's why we were allowed to operate out of South African premises. Were they taking orders from South African military? Or? No. I think our orders, our main orders, came from the British government. - That's my opinion. - The British government? Yeah. Well... From our British handlers, controllers or whatever. And... to this day I still believe that we were a sub-unit of some British... - Entity? - ...entity. Would you think that's really true? You know... three days ago, I met Alexander Jones. He seemed very credible. He doesn't offer any documentation. But he sure seems to be a person who is in the know. Let's put it this way... for four years after I left SAIMR, they tried to recruit me back every single month. - Every month? - Every month, Maxwell would set up a meeting with me, send somebody, stuff like that. And, eventually it became to the point of where... they were indicating of threatening my family. And Maxwell... I went to his offices one day in Alex, and I threatened him. I said to him straight, "As much as you know people, you've got to remember I've also got my own team." I said, "You guys either back off, or one of us are gonna die." So... it ended on bad terms, in the sense of it, because, I mean, I'd had enough. I had a family. Once I started my family I wasn't single anymore. It wasn't just me. And I had to take the responsibility. So, you know what you do, you... My view of thinking is get rid of everything that can incriminate you. Or get... So you destroyed everything pointing towards you - and SAIMR in having a past together? - Yeah. Yes. But is it bad for the story? - "Is it bad for the story?" - This story. - Yes? - Because... it begins... with Goran Bjorkdahl and I, trying to solve the mystery about who killed Dag Hammarskjold. - Okay. - And... then, suddenly... it's something entirely different. But I was going to ask, is the mystery solved? Or, have you just switched to something else now? Or, you don't mind about... what was supposed to be solved in the first place? So... did the South African Maritime Research Institute... kill Dag Hammarskjold? I won't say... There was involvement. What do you base this theory on? There were photos that I can recall seeing in one of our meetings, and it was what they used as a recruitment tool. There was... one photo... where you could see, where all the trees were burnt. Where there was a forest, I assume it was a forest. All the trees were burnt in it. You could see the ant hills... stuff like that. There was a photo of the guys in their "fatigues" standing on the ant hills and that. And then, there was the photo of the plane on one side. So we were given three photos. What guys were on the photo? Maxwell was in the photo. He was very young. - Keith Maxwell? - Yeah. He was definitely there. Because that was... I can still remember the picture. He was still wearing shorts, long socks... and combat boots. With this camouflage hat. There was two other guys. One was in full military fatigues. And he had a beard. Could the bearded guy be the agent code named "Congo Red"? Yeah. I would say 80 percent. Probably that would have been Congo Red. - That would be Congo Red? - Yeah. Did you already summarize? The whole story? - No. - Not yet? No. Maybe I can get an idea when you summarize it. We do manage to establish that... SAIMR was very real. But... but still, you know... It borders on fiction. Some of it is real, and some of it is very difficult to prove. Maxwell meets with a South African journalist - named De Wet Potgieter. - Yes. And he gives him a lot of SAIMR documents, including a... sort of memoir written by Maxwell, called, "The Story of My Life". It's a fictionalized account of Maxwell's life. But... the part he gave De Wet Potgieter... is not the full story. The last part of the story is to be found in the possession of Dagmar Feil's mother. Okay, that I found very strange. Did your mother get this at one time only? Yes. Yes. I think just prior to this, Lieutenant Maxwell, or Commander Maxwell, however he referred to himself. I think at the point where he was ready to leave, he gave my mother everything he had in hand, to aid her and help her to find the murderer. Because why else would he have done this? I want to be sure that this is actually Maxwell writing these memoirs. This is his handwriting, right? Yeah, I know. This is Maxwell's handwriting. Would he have been doing the... Because some of the pages have been written on a typewriter, - and some of them are in hand. - Yeah, he had one of those old... typewriters if you wanna call it. So it's possible, yeah. - Would he have done the typing himself? - Himself? Yes. Yeah With stuff like that, he would not... - Would not use a secretary? - He would not use a secretary. He wouldn't have even use his wife. One thing I can say, if we were having talks about SAIMR, and his wife came into the room, wherever we were or whatever, he would tell her to leave. It seems quite bizarre. It almost looks like the rantings of a person who is losing his mind. Why would he write a fictionalized account of his life? You know, at the end of his life, he had lost it. - He had gone mad? - So, only he would know. In the part of the manuscript of Keith Maxwell's memoir that was given to Dagmar Feil's mother, he provides the context for the Operation Celeste papers, which suggests that Maxwell knew about Operation Celeste, the plan to kill Dag Hammarskjold, before the papers ended up in the hands of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998. Has everybody got a copy of these secret documents from the Institute of Maritime Research? This part of the manuscript is handwritten. Maxwell writes about how the men of the Marine Institute have "plans for Dag". In the manuscript, Commodore Wagman chairs a brainstorming session about ways to kill the General Secretary when he comes to the Congo. One of the officers suggests poisoning Dag Hammarskjold with potassium cyanide, much to the displeasure of Wagman. The agent known as Congo Red is present at the meeting, and is just about to open his mouth when Commodore Wagman says, "No! No! I don't want hours of discussion about possible methods. I want a workable plan with at least three alternatives on my desk within seven days." Option one was the bomb, to disable the plane, to bring it down. That would have been choice number one. So that the plane crashes. Number two, have the fighter jet around as a contingency, in the case that the bomb didn't do the damage that it did in the plan. Then, shoot the plane down. Number three, have the contingency shooting from the ground to bring the plane down, and clean up. There is a picture of Dag Hammarskjold and... in the picture of Dag Hammarskjold, there is a playing card tucked in his shirt collar. - Yes, there is an ace. - Yes. - Yes, there's an ace. - The ace of spades? The ace of spades. And that was well know in security circles. That was the way that the CIA operated. That was a CIA card. And that's why I say the CIA was involved. So, that is a calling card from the CIA? That is a calling card from the CIA. Did you encounter the ace of spades being used later on in your own career in SAIMR? In SAIMR, yes. Once or twice. Up in the DRC itself. And That was also because of CIA involvement? Because of CIA involvement. And I would even go... and... Can you switch off? Next, Maxwell writes about how a SAIMR operative plants a bomb in the wheel bay of Dag Hammarskjold's plane. Then follows an emergency meeting in SAIMR's situation room at two o'clock in the morning on the 18th of September 1961. An operative has phoned to say that the bomb did not explode at takeoff. Commodore Wagman says, "Gentlemen. -30. Go home and get some sleep. We'll work something out in the morning." So, in Maxwell's memoir, we have a "Commodore Wagman", who seems to be the same person as Commodore Wagner, who signs off on the Operations Celeste papers. But, then we showed Groenewald these documents... and he was totally dismissive of them. He said you would never put something like that on paper. He said it's very unprofessional. It's not professional. Not professional at all. I disagree, because a lot of our stuff went on paper. I disagree. So it would be normal for SAIMR to put things like this on paper? To the relevant people, yes. The purpose being? For confirmation purposes, to say that there is backing, you know there is an approval, that it's sanctioned. So SAIMR had, in fact, its own bureaucracy? Yes, definitely. Very. And they were very strict and particular about it. For example, let's go back a few steps. When we saw Commodore Wagner... etiquette is, you were not allowed to approach him. You met Wagner? Not personally, but I remember him being at one of the meetings. - You saw him? - Yes. What did he look like? He was an old, frail man at that point in time. Because for us, it is totally impossible to find anything about him. Look, I know he was a businessman. Definitely. - What kind of business? - If I remember it correctly, it was something to do in the medical field. Then, a knock on the door. A lieutenant enters, salutes the Commodore, and hands him a slip of paper. "What is this? "Oh my God, it worked," Wagman said, and waved the message at the others. "She blew on approach to Ndola at around midnight. It worked, by God, it worked." There were smiles all around. Congo Red had delivered. In the last part of Maxwell's memoirs, he writes about going to visit the archives of SAIMR... which are, according to Maxwell's script located in a shopping mall in Randburg. And there, an antiques shop is to be found, managed by a man named Mr. Hadley. You know anyone named Mr. Hadley, having an antiques shop? - No. - He enters the shop, and in the back room, there is a... a filing cabinet, containing what Maxwell calls "The Travelogue". It's all the microfilms and pictures from... SAIMR operations in foreign countries... from I think, '52 to '84. But he seems to be especially concerned - about year 1961. - '61. He takes all of this material with him, and goes back to himself and burns it, destroys all the pictures, all the microfilm. But that sounds something what Maxwell would do. That is something that he would do. Anybody that resisted any white form of... manipulation on the African continent, SAIMR was prepared to go and quell those for a price. At a cost. And that was one thing that Dag Hammarskjold was totally against. And he wanted every country for the people of the country. And obviously, when you've got investments, when there's minerals, gold, diamonds, oil and all of that stuff... and we all know which countries... He was a threat. We countered effectively efforts from all sides to make the Congo a happy hunting ground for national interests. To be a roadblock to such efforts is to make yourself the target of attacks from all those who find their plans thwarted. He was killed because he was going to change the way that Africa dealt with the rest of the world financially. And he was a threat. And who's got the most to lose? Corporate. Corporate business worldwide. People are greedy. People want what others have got, and they don't want to pay for it. That's why they come to Africa. Because Africa seem to be easy and third world. And now, Africa is starting to fight back. And I think it would have happened 30 ago, 40 years ago, if Dag Hammarskjold had his way. Africa would have been a completely different continent today... if Dag Hammarskjold was allowed to live and follow through on his mandate. - So... - Yes? The last narration is about... "Goran Bjorkdahl... will continue his work. Last I heard of him, he had gone up the Congo River." "Last I heard of him, he had gone up the Congo River, looking for Maxwell's secret jungle laboratory." Perfect.
