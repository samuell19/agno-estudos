I'm home. Welcome home. Give me a moment, dinner is almost ready. Ah, I'm so tired. Please stop throwing your clothes everywhere, you're not a child anymore. Why can't I? I worked hard today during my job. How was work? Don't ask. What's more important is the process of hardwork. Thank you for the meal. Delicious!! Hasegawa is my coworker who is 8 years younger than me. We started living together about a year ago. At that time I was still living with my mother. Huh? What's happening. Wrong side, wrong side. Hold on. What are you doing? I am moving out of our house. I leave the rest to you. Mr Nakajima wants to open a coffee shop. and he asked me if I want to follow him. Who is Mr Nakajima? Then what about me? I'm leaving, so you can do whatever you want. Then who will do the household chores? I am not your maid. I still have many things l want to do in life. Mr Nakajima says he will support me. So who the hell is Mr Nakajima? No, no, no. It was around that time that Hase, my junior, also needed place to stay, so he moved in with me. He pays half the rent and he helps to do chores. There are benefits to having him here. Is it okay if I continue like this? What are you referring to? Didn't we all want to step into society when we were young? Like getting married, having kids, and buying a house? Yeah? But in the end we are no longer young and we are staying up playing football games. Haruta, do you not want to get married? Of course, I really want to, I'm even thinking about it now. But no one wants to marry me. Yes! That's because your standards are way too high. No, my standards aren't high at all. List them out then. Like a lolita? And she should have a big chest. Whenever I come home from a long day of work, she would be waiting for me with delicious food already cooked. Your standards are way too high. After that she would play games with me during which she will purposely lose and let me win. That's really asking for too much. What about you Hase? Right now it would be too troublesome to date a girl. You're the same as me I'm not the same as you. Just us guys living a relaxed life everyday l thought this freedom of life would last forever. Chief. Please check through this report. Okay. I'll sign this now, just give me a moment. Thank you. Chief, may l interrupt you for a while? Sure. Today is my last day of work. Ohh, I see. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Hey, don't cry. I'll leave the wedding speech to you. Okay. If you guys fight even if you are not in the wrong, just apologise. Yes. Coming from a divorced man, what I say is accurate. Um, do you want me to help take a photo to commemorate? Oh yes, we should. Apologies for troubling you. Let's use my phone to take the picture then. Okay. Everyone please gather for a group photo. Okay, say cheese. Oh it might be blurry, let me take a look. Haruta. Take a better photo. Haruta..hurry up. What is this. Did something happen? What's wrong? Sorry, the photo was seriously blurry. Haruta, join the group. Yamashita, help to take the picture. Let me take the photo. What are you talking about? Everyone, please stand properly! \n -Yes. -I'm gonna take the photo now, okay? \n-Take a nice one! Okay, say cheese. Eh? Was it a dream? No, that was definitely me. This can't be true. What is it? I like you. No, no, no chief. You saw the photos so I might as well tell you. Although it's late for me to tell you this but I can't lie to myself any more. You're joking right? I will say it again. I like you. Um chief.. Call me Kurosawa. You must be joking right? Look at me. Do these eyes look like I'm joking? That..I will wait for you about that issue. Please think about it carefully. Okay. Then I'll leave now. There is a saying that no matter who it is a person will have luck in love three times in one lifetime. But god... What? Chief Kurosawa confessed to you? I was so shocked. Then what are you gonna do l myself am not sure As it is l don't know how I should face the Chief tomorrow morning at work. So the chief likes you.. People are hard to guess... ...I can only laugh at this event. Yes. Going to take a shower now. For the Chief's sake. No, no, no. Sorry, Hase, can you pass me a towel? Thanks. I like you. Eh? Haruta, I already know your preferences. But am l no good? Dear God, Sorry, but I don't need this type of love to be blooming. As if that would happen. What are you thinking? Hilarious. No, no, no your jokes are too much. Anyone would have taken it seriously. And what was with that expression of yours? No, no, no. I never made that type of expression I was seriously scared just now. Because just now... No, no, no. You're gonna catch a cold. Of course I would catch a cold like this. I got scared to death. Next up is... This product's battery. Sorry to disturb. Chief, this. The design is completely different. Yes. Who was the one who sent the wrong design specifications? Eh? For real? Apologies, for this month the person in charge has changed. So who is it? That would be me. So it was you.. didn't l say it before to keep on checking that the design is correct before sending it? I did my best. What do you mean you did your best. You have to keep checking, it's a must to check properly. For goodness sake. Haruta, how can this happen. My apologies. How did you check? I did email it to them, but they never responded so I assumed they were ok. Seriously?? How could you just email it to them.. Eh? Why is it suddenly my fault? It should be the other way around. What do you mean "it should be the other way around"? It's your fault. Not the other way around. It's not the other way around, right, Haruta? Contact the company immediately and redo the design. My sincerest apologies. I'll have it done now. You come with me. This is considered abuse. Hurry up and come. My apologies. Ah...What's wrong with that guy? Thank you for your hard work. Chief, you've worked hard, too. It seems like we need to catch up with the stock delivery items. I'm really sorry about that. Aren't you going home, yet? I just need to send an email and then I'm done. I see. What is the Chief doing here at this late hour? Could it be that he was waiting for me? Eh! Why? Is it to keep anyone who is outside from seeing? Oioi why are you removing your clothes? Why are you removing your jacket? Oi, not the necktie too, oi. Does he want to kiss? He's not doing this for the sake of kissing me, right? Oi, why isn't the computer working? Crap. You shouldn't overwork yourself, okay? What? He didn't add anything into the drink right? By the way... ...Haruta I forgot that I have something to do I will leave first. Oi, Haruta. Haruta. Haruta This can't be happening. Haruta. This can't be happening. Haruta. Hold on... Hurry. Hurry, hurry! I'm scared to death. What is it... seriously. I'll make a bento lunch for you tomorrow~. What the hell. Woah... amazing. You like fried chicken right. Yes. Okay, open your mouth. I will eat it by myself. I don't know if you will like it. Thank you for the meal. Ah, my heart is beating fast. Thank you for the meal. It's delicious. Ah thank goodness. I was a bit worried that making a bento for you suddenly might be too much. It's too much. Wait, what? Eh? You're funny. Oh yeah, there is an egg in there as well. It's not the sweet type. Okay. Um... Haruta. Could it be that you have a girlfriend? Eh? You don't need to answer. It's alright. l see... Of course you have a girlfriend. You have one, don't you? No. Sorry to have troubled you. No, no, no, I don't have a girlfriend. And you're not really troubling me. Really? Y-yes, yes. Um... I heard that you're living with someone. Living together? News here travels fast. We are not living together, we are just roommates. I'm sharing the house with my junior colleague. He is Hasegawa from the design department. Hasegawa! You don't need to give me an answer to my confession right away. No need to rush. What are you doing? Why are you washing a lunchbox? Nothing. From your posture you seem hurt Asuka. Someone confessed to you?? You're voice is too loud. Who is it? From one of the departments? Oh, is it Misaki-chan? You're wrong. Not even close. You won't know her. "Her"... If we are referring to genders then. Congratulations. Research say that the sucess rate of 35 year olds getting married is 2%. What type of information are you telling me I checked online. Hey Asuka, what do you think? After attending my friend's weeding at that time, it seems nice. But when I think about it carefully marriage is not suited for me. Why? Because the aftermath of getting married is troublesome. For example, needing to visit their parents. Household chores would double. Marriage life is the worst. Not happening. What? You're screwed. I don't need to hear that from you. Almost there... You can do it, you're reaching the sofa. Good, good. Sorry for the intrusion. He kept on drinking alcohol just now. How much did you drink? He keeps saying that Chief confessed to him. Yes..and she has a crush on me. What? What are you saying? You don't know what you're saying. -Asuka, Asuka. \n-What is it? Listen to me. What do you want me to hear you say? Nothing. Asuka, do you want some tea? No thanks, I'm going home. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. It's cold... it's so cold. What happened to you? It's rare to see you like this. I was in so much shock about the Chief confessing that all I could do was drink alcohol. What's that lunch box over there? Don't tell me.. The Chief made lunch for you? It was delicious I ate everything and that means.. Next time I'll be the one who's eaten. Am I wrong Hase? Don't talk nonsense. What were you a about to do? No, no, no. You must be joking right? Didn't l say it last time? That I like you. Huh? But it was a joke, wasn't it? Eh? Wait, you're being serious about it? Yes. What do you mean "yes"? What were you gonna do? This is unthinkable. Is it really impossible? For us to be together. No, no, no, stop it. I'm getting scared. I'm suddenly fully awake. I'm serious about you. No, no. Seriously, stop it. I never had the same intention as you when I started living with you. What the hell? I'm so disgusted. "Disgusted"... I thought we are just senior and junior co-workers. Aren't we? What? Have you always been looking at me as a love interest? What the hell... I feel so cheated! You don't have to say it so rudely. Stop messing with me. I'm going to get some food. Don't go, don't go. Why? Dont tell me you two got together.. Why? As if that would happen. I'm completely fine with it. So I don't have any judgement on this type of thing. Well, I do. Stop letting your imagination wander. That's boring. Ah. Isn't that Hase? Hase. It's fine, don't call him. Why? Well... We fought yesterday. You two fought? You fought with a guy younger than you? We live together. So we would definitely fight sometimes. Then that's good. Hase. Thank you for yesterday. It's fine. I heard that you guys are fighting. Let me guess. After I left... After Haruta got drunk, he started to wet his pants. You guessed correctly. You seem to I know Haruta very well. That's because we are childhood friends I hope that you will continue to take care of him in the future. Wait a minute I don't want his type. What do you mean my type? Thank you for your hard work today. Chief. You look cute! Really? The costume suits you. Have you tried the chocolate cake yet? No, not yet. It's delicious. Where is it?. Over there. Oh I see, it's over there I'll go eat. Stupid. Um... I remember you are... Hasegawa from the Design Department. So it's you. You're the junior who's living with Haruta. We're not really living together. We are just roommates. I'm going to get some chocolate cake. Wait. What? Give him to me. What's with this situation. Let's talk, upstairs. Let's go. Why? Can you take your hands off Haruta? Hands off... ? Cant you tell that Haruta doesn't like it. When you suddenly made him a bento lunchbox, obviously for him it was too much. I'm sorry, I told him about it. You hated it? No, no it's not like that. So you hated it? Not at all. You are his boss, of course he doesn't dare to say he hates it. Stop it, Hase. Could it be... Towards Haruta, you I like him. So what's wrong with that? Wait wait wait. You... Only I can protect him. Hey, you... You don't know anything about Haruta. Yes, I do. -Wait, wait \n-What is it. What are you doing? Okay, then. Can you name 10 good things about Haruta? Then can you name 10 bad things about Haruta? "Bad"? Of course I can. Um..bad things about him? He is not confident enough. Too loving. He is too cool. He is indecisive. Grumpy in the morning. Throws his clothes around. Doesn't put his shoes away. Doesn't wash the dishes. Always wants to take a bite of someone else's food Bad at directions, spends his money anyhow he wants. Snores while he sleeps. Do I really have so many? Don't you know an old man like you is for causing trouble Haruta? Old man? What's wrong with being an old man? What does me being an old man have to do with it? An old man is an old man. Stupid, Stupid, stupid. Wait. Please put it down. Sushi is Haruta's most favourite food. I know that. Please give me some wassabi. Okay. What are you doing? You're putting too much. It's going to be very spicy. Here you go. Thank you for the meal. It hurts! It's so spicy! This is Haruta's favourite pizza. You should be able to eat it right? Here you go. Eat it. It's very hot... very hot. Hey. Your lips look dry. Oh, really? Use this to hydrate your lips then. Your eyes look extremely dry. Let's wet your eyes. Stop it. Stop fighting over me! Eye cleanser. Lip moisturiser. It's for your eyes, use it. Eye cleanser. Please stop it chief. Please listen to me. I'm sorry. Haruta. -Haruta. \n-What is it chief? It's spicy. What? What is spicy? -The wassabi is spicy. \n-Hold on. Chief, chief. -The wassabi is Spicy \n-Chief. No, wait Yamashita. Yamashita, it's not what you think. Thank you for your hard work. Yamashita. It's spicy, the wassabi is very spicy. Chief. Chief... hold on. There is no mistake. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Morning. That's weird. Is the paper stuck in there? You just need to open this to take the paper. Huh? Um... I'm not that type of person. What do you mean "not that type of person"? What in the world is going... Is Haruta really gay? Sorry, messaged the wrong person. What's going on here? Why do all of you think I am gay? It's very spicy. Yamashita. So it was you who told everyone?! Haruta Haruta! I can't survive in this company. What nonsense are you saying? Why do you doubt me about this? Who was the one who's slow in responding to the confession? What do you mean "slow'"? What are your thoughts exactly on chief? I don't know. What are your thoughts on him as a person? As a person? Do you like him? Yes. But I like him as a person, not in a romantic way. Right now liking and genders don't matter. It does. It does matter. Then you are biased towards women. What? Since when have you been like this towards love? Then this is your own problem now. Hang in there. Hey... What are my good points about me? You are a mystery. Hase, it's been a while. Why don't we play? Sorry, but... I need to wake up early tomorrow. Oh I see I'm sorry. It's okay. Good night. What are you doing now? I need to reply him. Sorry to disturb. Can you. Give me the data from just now? Okay. -Is the one on the USB thumbdrive okay? \n-Yes. It's okay. Wait no it's not what you think. It's fine. You can do it... "For Haruta'" Dear Harutan. Merry Christmas. This christmas present I gave you... is something that I hand made. "Hand made." A handmade towel/cloth. You might not have known this but I am a man who is divorced. Looking back at it, about 10 years ago. That was the time you came into the company and entered my department. And that was when I fell in love with you. And that was when I realised I was serious about it. So I decided to get divorced and leave my wife. Are you serious? What do I like about you? Well... there are many things. No matter what happens you always do your best. At times of failure you smiled. Your cute butt. And that you help to cover up your juniors' mistakes. You don't complain and do your best I like all these about you. You always said that you don't have any good points about yourself. But for me... I can clearly see all of your good points. Chief... Even though I managed to hide my feelings well. I want to hear directly from you. Your answer to my confession. -Please go out with me. \n-Sorry. Chief. I'm really sorry. But why? Um... To me, work is more important than lov.. You're lying. That's the excuse everyone uses when rejecting someone. And everyone gets along well. No...um... Why won't you go out with me? Is it because I am your boss? Or is it because.. Is it because I am a guy? Why? Why...?. I like you. I like you, Chief. But I don't like you in a romantic way. I like you as a person. I have a lot of respect for you as my boss. You have leadership skills. And when someone makes mistakes you don't give up on them. You always help to take care of the company. I really admire you. I really like you as a person. But... "My type of "like" is not love. That's why... ...I cannot go out with you. But... thanks to you chief. Because you've always encouraged me from the start, I start to gain confidence in myself. I'm seriously grateful for that. Thank you so much for liking me. I'm very sorry. I understand. -Haruta \n-Yes? Next year we will be going overseas for our work. I hope you will do your best. Yes, sir. I'm going now. The chief... I rejected him. Oh, I see... Rejection is a painful thing to experience. But... I am better at being rejected. But at least you gave your answer properly. You did very well. Haruta. You can come in. -How is this considered clean? \n-Shut up. If you want to complain then go home. This place is dirty. After you rejected the Chief, there's still Hase. You still don't know how to face him?. Even though it's not fair for Chief. But Hase is the same. Having distinguished a partner no matter what happens is not very good. But he is a guy. Love is difficult. I'm hungry. I'll see if there is anything to eat. Do you want instant noodles? Or do you want pasta? There is not enough vegetables. If you want to have vegetables then eat this. Here you go. That's not the issue here. Oh, right... The photos from the christmas party came out. Want to see? Yes... Haruta, your eyes were closed in all the photos. Why? Huh? What is going on? What's wrong? He is indecisive, grumpy in the morning Throws clothes around, doesn't his put his shoes away Doesn't wash the dishes, always wants to take bite out of else's someone food Bad at directions, spends his money anyhow he wants, snores while sleeps Whyyyy? Haruta? Asuka. As I thought... I'm going home. Did I just get rejected? Seriously? Hase? Hase? Hase? Please leave your message after the beep. Please remember to eat your vegetables properly. Huh? What's happening? Why am I running? Oi, where exactly am l running to? Sorry. -Watch where you're going, idiot. \n-I'm sorry Oh right... Hase. Why am I chasing after Hase... Hase! Haruta... what's wrong? What do you mean "what's wrong"? Don't just suddenly disappear on me. "Suddenly" Where did you go? I went home to visit my parents. What? Visit my parents. Didn't I also visit them last year during the same time? Oh, I see. So it's like that. What happened? What the hell? I thought you moved out of our house. Because... I called you disgusting. As if that would happen. Don't do things like this! I got so scared. I myself don't understand. What the hell. I ran so far. Haruta, you're so cute. No, you're wrong. It's not like that. Don't misunderstand this. I... got worried and came looking for you as a friend. I understand. Do you really understand? I'm saying this first: I like women. I will never date you. But... But... Being with you is very fun. So you are considered one of the best friends I have. So.. After that uh... Hey, you... ...I think it might be fine. Then... Kiss me one more time. Thanks to the original fansubbers! I merely OCRed the text and corrected some lines.
