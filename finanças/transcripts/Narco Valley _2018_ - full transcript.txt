That's actually what I was gonna talk to you about. Well, shit, you can stay here. I got an extra room. (J) That'll work. So you're not gonna introduce me? Victoria, this is my nephew, J. J Hustle. Pleasure's all mine. Come on in. Damn, tio, you doing all right for yourself. Hey, what can I say? Business is good. If you're hungry, help yourself to whatever you want in the kitchen. But don't eat too much. I'm making you something special, a little welcome home dinner. You're gonna like her cooking. Oh, yeah? It's been a while since I had a decent meal. Let me show you to your room. This is it. Make yourself at home. I appreciate it, tio. No worries. It'll be nice having family around. I got something for you until you get on your feet. I'll pay you back first chance I get. Don't worry about it. Get yourself settled. (hip hop music) (Victoria) Can I get you any more food? Nah, I'm good. Thanks though. My uncle was right. That was bomb. Of course I was right. I'll take another beer though. (Victoria) Coming right up. All right, so now that you're out, what are your plans for work? I was gonna go look around tomorrow, maybe find something at a shop. I know someone if you want me to make a phone call. That'd be dope, if it's not too much to ask. No, of course not, you're family. Are you sure you don't want a beer? I'm sure, not right now. (hip hop music) (phone beeps) (Juan) Can I help you? Yeah, I'm Chuey's nephew. He said you got a mechanic job for me. Right. I'm Juan, the owner. Nice to meet you. (J) Likewise. I appreciate the opportunity. No problem. Have a seat for me right over here. I'll be back at nine o'clock to help you get situated. Here's some rags and a cleaner. The vacuum's in the corner. We need this car detailed. The owner's gonna be here at 10 o'clock. Come and get me when you're done. You want me to clean cars? Yes, is there a problem? Yeah, I thought you had a mechanic job for me. No, I hired you on as a shop hand. This is stupid. I got experience. I ain't just some shop hand. Look, work hard around here for a few weeks, detailing cars, cleaning up, helping out Miguel. If I need a hand, I'll consider bringing you on as a mechanic. But first, you need to prove yourself around here, all right? Whatever. You said the vacuum's in the corner, right? Yes. (hip hop music) (phone beeps) Hey, you missed a spot. Why don't you come over here and say that? I'll knock that smile off your face. That's what the fuck I thought, Miguel. (Chuey) Nephew, come here. What's good? Hey, this is my homie, Spyder. This is my homie, Looney. This is my nephew, J. Your uncle told me a lot about you. Is that right? It's cracking, homie. When are you gonna join the team? We can use a soldier like you. That ain't gonna happen. It was good meeting you two. I gotta catch some sleep. What's up with your fam? Shit, he's just trying to stay clean. He'll come around. Just give him some time.

(Customer) Yeah, right here. Thank you. (car engine stalls) So how long do you say it's been doing this for? About a week or so. About a week? Well, it sounds like you need a new alternator. How much is that gonna run me? Let me jump on our computer and I'll get you an estimate, all right? I'll be right back. You need a new battery. The guy that was looking at it said it's the alternator. I mean it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. An alternator's not gonna do that. If you wanna waste your money, fine, but you need a new battery. Okay, for the new alternator with parts and labor, you're looking at $400. Okay, that guy just said it's the battery. Who? That guy? Yeah. No, he's just a shop hand. He washes the cars. He doesn't know how to fix it, you know. So that will be cash or charge? Charge, charge. (hip hop music) It's all in here? Yup, all 100 Gs. That's the way I like it. That's my nephew. All right, man. (hip hop music) Yeah, you hear the knocking noise? Yeah. You're gonna need a complete engine rebuild. That sounds expensive. How much will that be? Okay, let me go to the computer and I'll give you a quote, all right? I'll be right back. Sure. Your car's just low on oil. You hear that? The knocking's gone. You mean I don't need an engine rebuild? The other guy's an idiot. Hey, what's going on here? I just fixed the car for you. You're welcome. How much do I owe you for the oil? (hip hop music) (phone beeps) (knocking on door) (J) You wanted to see me? Yeah, come on in. I want to talk to you for a moment. What's up? So the till has been coming up short the last few days, and Miguel said that he saw you messing around on the register. And you believe that stupid asshole? Look, Miguel's worked for me for many years, and I've never had a problem until you started working here. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let you go. Fuck this job! I don't need it. And you better not let me catch you on the avenue. I really wish you were here, little bro. Things would be a lot easier for me. I don't know how I'm gonna do this, but it's game time. (hip hop music) (phone rings) Hello. Hey, what's up, nephew? I'm chilling. I'm gonna be at the Circle K park. All right, I'll meet you here. All right. (hip hop music) So what's on your mind? I think I need to get back in the game. (Chuey) Yeah? Well, if you're still down to put me on. If you're serious, I got a starter pack that can get you going. That'll work. Let's do it. (hip hop music) So what do you think about the food? Tacos are good. It's a chill little spot. I've been coming here for a minute. Yeah. So how an old guy like you pull off Victoria? I got lucky. She's a good woman. Oh, yeah? So let me ask you something. How does it feel working for your uncle and the big boys? You know me, I do it big. You ready to take over the world? All day. That's what I like to hear. I gotta be honest with you, it's nice having you around, having family, someone I can trust. I love you, nephew. (hip hop music) What's going on? It's a long drive from Washington, ain't it? Yeah, about 21 hours. Yeah, we're gonna have to make bet on Cardinals and Seahawks one day. (Man) Yeah, let's do it. All right, man. Can I talk to you a minute? It's about business. Yeah, go ahead. What you think about me setting up shop outside our territory? With the product we got, we'll take over in no time. (Chuey) No. (J) What you mean no? I mean no. I have an agreement with our rival dealers. They don't come into our territory. We don't come into their territory. It keeps things peaceful. Besides, I'm doing good. Why ruin a good thing? You're doing good. I'm coming up short. You just started. Your time will come. (J) I don't got time to waste. I should be making what you make. Hey, I gotta run. I'll see you later. (knocking on door) (Victoria) Mind if I come in? It's your house, right? So I heard what you told your uncle about expanding the business into rival territories, and I think you're right. Of course, I'm right, but does it matter? That fool's in charge. Well, he doesn't have to be. So what are you saying? You know, I've told your uncle for a while now that he needs to expand his business. (J) Oh, yeah? Yeah, but he never listens. He's not like you. He's happy where he's at. Well, what am I like? You're ambitious, and I like a man with ambition. You know, your uncle told me about you before you got locked up. He said you had a whole lot of people working under you, and that you made so much that you had to hire people just to count it. That was a while back. Yeah, but people don't change, and I think you should be in charge. I can't argue with that. What about my uncle? What about your uncle? (gentle guitar music) Hello? Yeah. I think I wanna get that spot we were talking about. Yeah. All right. Later. (hip hop music) Imma need another brick. 30 racks. That was quick. I told you if you were patient that the business would come. Yeah, whatever. Get him another brick. You know, nephew, you don't have to work all the time. You should take a little bit of time and relax and enjoy the little things. Ain't no holiday for a hustler. I'm serious. Take a little bit of time and relax. Well, I gotta go. I got work to do. (hip hop music) Like the car. I'm moving up in the game. (Man) It's all there. We're gonna be ready in about a week. (J) That'll work. (Man) All right now. What's going on, man? (Man) What's up, man? How's it going out there in Colorado? (Man) It's good. The weed is legal. That'll work. This the spot my bitch put me up on that said Chuey nephew be serving at. Look. Look at that fool right there. Caught his ass slipping. Going against the grain. He is fucked up. (Looney) I heard he's pushing a lot of weight. Man, he ain't doing shit. Shit, he's pushing more than us. Man, wait till Chuey find out about this shit. (suspenseful music) Hey, nephew, come here! What's up, tio? I heard you didn't listen to me and went into rival territories. Is this true? Who told you that, one of these fools? Is it true or not? Yeah, it's true. And what? I told you to stay out of the rival territories. I have an agreement with them. Things are good. Yeah, maybe for you, but not for me. I wasn't making shit, and I told you. You think Imma risk going back to jail for that shit? Damn, if you had just been patient. Fuck being patient. Patient people don't sell dope. People sell dope to make quick cash. Well, that's not how I run my business. I gave you a place to stay, gave you a job, and you're gonna disrespect me? Family or not, you and I are done. You're on your own and unemployed. (scoffs) Don't trip. I don't need you anymore. Imma get mine. And you two, Imma see you. I promise that. (calm music) (knocking on door) Who the fuck is it? So are you just gonna stand there or are you gonna invite me in? Come in. How you find me? I know a lot of people, and not that you're hard to find. So what are you gonna do about this situation with your tio? Let me worry about that. Come on, tell me. I'm curious. I'm sure you are. I see. You don't have a plan, do you? You're just gonna let your tio and his homies kick you to the curb and you're not gonna do a damn thing about it, like you're some kinda lame. I ain't no fucking lame. Imma dust them fools. My tio can get it too. That's it? That's your plan? (J) You got a better one? Of course I do. Well, let's hear it. All right. Come over here and sit down. (J) So what's your plan? So I know you've been making a lot these last couple of weeks. Did you save any of that? Yeah, I saved some. Just some? Well, most of it. Good, 'cause I'm gonna need it. (scoffs) That's your plan, give my money to a bitch? Nah, I'm good. You're gonna give me the money so I can hire a gunman. Oh, so now you know a gunman. Like I said, I know a lot of people. Let's say I believe you and I give you all my money to hire this gunman, then what? Then I wait to find out when your uncle's next drop is. You show up with the gunman I hire for you, and you kill everybody, including your uncle. And you get to keep all the money and the drugs. Sounds too easy. It's because it is easy. You kill your uncle, and just like that, you're in charge. You know how much I like a man who's in charge. (J) Why don't you show me how much you like a man in charge. Shit. I gotta get going. Your uncle's gonna be wondering where I'm at. So you got the money or do you need time to get it? Yeah, I got it. Don't make me regret this. Relax, papi. You and I both want the same thing.

There's a restaurant on the back side of the building, and the man that I hired will meet you there. All right, I'll be there. (Victoria) Bye. You know Victoria? Yeah, you J Hustle? Get in.

Imma give the drugs back to show good faith, tell him I caught the motherfuckers that killed my uncle and his guy, tell him I took care of that then set up an arrangement so he'll still supply me.

You know, you've come a long way since the last time I was out here. Things change. Can't you fucking tell? I always knew you were gonna do some big things. You sure have a funny way of showing it, girl. You always had that presence about you whenever you walked into a room. Is that right? You're so ambitious, so hungry, so focused. It's only a matter of time... Same old tricks. Grow the fuck on up already, girl. Hey, get the fuck off me. Damn, shit. You used to like it when I touched you. That was a lifetime ago. I ain't the same naive sucker out of (mumbles), all right? I know who killed Chuey and your men. What kind of fucking games are you playing, girl? I'm not playing any games. I know who killed Chuey and your men. Who killed them? It was J. J Hustle killed his own uncle? Yes! Seeing how much money his uncle was making, he's seen the opportunity. He killed his uncle, his men, and killed your men at the drop. How'd you find out? Come on, Loco, you know me. I find out everything. You expect me to believe your disloyal ass? Okay, well, think about it. He comes to you with six kilos from the drop where your men were killed and has enough money to buy the drugs back from you. Don't you think that's a little convenient? Well, what do you think he's gonna do now when he sees how well off you are? He's gonna want what you have, and he's gonna take it. Hey, homie. We need to look into who killed Chuey. I just got word that it's J Hustle. Look into that for me, homie.

Is that right, motherfucker? Oh, fuck! Fuck you! No! Fuck! Now I'm gonna ask you again. Who killed Chuey and my men? Fuck you, man! Now fuck me? Nah, fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck! You wanna run out fingers, motherfucker? Now Imma ask you again. Who killed Chuey and my men? (gunman screams) Who killed Chuey? It was J Hustle, J Hustle. - J Hustle. - Fuck! He rolled up on them. I was with him! He killed two other men. He shot 'em right on the chest. Are you sure about that? (gunman screams) It's J Hustle, man. Fuck. You gotta believe me. Please. You know what. I hate fucking snitches. No, fuck you! (gunshot blares) I brought the little homies with me. I hope you don't... What the fuck is she doing here? You wouldn't believe the shit I found out from your people. What you talking about? I know who killed Chuey and my worker. It was you, motherfucker. What's this stupid bitch been telling you? (speaks in foreign language) I got enough information from your hit man that you hired before I had him smoked. You should learn how to have your men with you before you start acting up. (laughs) I think you better learn how to pay 'em better, fool. Take this motherfucker to the desert. Let's go! (suspenseful music) Don't take it personal, homie. This is a dirty game. (gunshots blare) (hip hop music) What's up, Loco? Come check it out, homie. So this your operation? How much you guys make in a week right here? About 15, 16 Gs a week, homie. It's gonna be 25 a week from now on, homie. All right? All right. My boys are gonna collect once a week right here, all right? How the fuck are we gonna handle that, homie? I don't fucking know. (winds howling) (Creeper) I got the payment from Negro and Flaco in Phoenix. Put it on the table with the rest of the money, homie. Hey, Loco, you think I can get a little bit of extra feria so I can take my daughter to the amusement park. Do I look like the motherfucking charity? Get on with that extra shit. Fuck.

To see Loco. Who? I know he's here. Tell him Victoria's here to see him. Victoria's here. He said he's busy. You gotta kick rocks. (Victoria) Don't touch me! (doorbell rings) Who the fuck's at my door? Yo, Giant, get over here! Aren't you gonna invite me in? Hell, nah. Really? Whatever. Me and you need to talk. Talk about what? Me and you. There ain't no me and you, girl. But the whole J thing. I told you things. I thought we had something. Well, you thought wrong. Come on, baby, don't be like this. Check this out. This whole me and you think, it ain't happening. So please get away from my house, stay away from my work, and just get the fuck on, all right? (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) So what's up, Victoria? You got something important to tell me? Aren't you gonna come in? You look tense. You should sit, relax. So I heard Loco put you in charge of the Phoenix distribution. Yeah, that's right. That's sexy. I like that. I like a man that can run shit. So, how's business? You must be making a lot now. Business is all right. Just all right? You should be making more than you did when you were working for J, you know. I mean you must be now that you're in charge and all. Well, Loco's taking most of it, you know. Does he? Don't you do all the work? Fuck, yeah. I bust my fucking ass. Well, maybe you should say something. You're right. But then again, maybe you shouldn't. He might see that as an act of unloyalty. And doesn't he kill anyone that's disloyal? Yeah, he does. So maybe you shouldn't talk. Maybe you should do something. You know what, Imma kill that motherfucker. What's up, Negro? Why we way out here for, homie? It's Loco, homie. We gotta kill him. Kill Loco? Are you outta your mind? It's the only way. That motherfucker's taking too big of a cut. That's what I told you in the first place. Call him up. Let's renegotiate. (mumbles) and end up like fucking J Hustle did? Shit, if I try to negotiate with him after all we know, that'll be a one-way ride to the middle of the desert, homie. Think about that shit. Fuck. We gotta kill that motherfucker. We don't split the profit with nobody. You hear me? With nobody, dog. And once we're done with that, we keep all the feria for ourselves. So what's up? How do we do this? Shit, how much money you got? (upbeat electronic music) (Creeper) Where's everyone at? Did you give 'em the day off? Don't trip, homie. Here's Loco's payment. And this is for you. (Creeper) What's this for? I'm assuming Loco pays you like shit too, and I'm pretty sure you're tired of it. What are you trying to say? That right there is half. The other half you get when you kill Loco. You've got some balls, homie. All right then, go back to Cali, homie. While he makes everything, you ain't gonna make nothing. You already have the other half of the money? Yeah, I got it. If I do this, you better be good for the other half. Don't worry, we're good for it. Good, because if not, I'll find you and I'll take more than what you owe me. (hip hop music) (Loco) Nana, I brought you some groceries, right? Ooh, that was very nice of you. Thank you so much, I appreciate that. (Loco) No problem, no problem. Here's a little something something (mumbles). Anything you need, you can call, right? Sure, thank you so much and God bless you. Where are you? Well, your daughter's been waiting for you all day. I thought you were supposed to take her out for her birthday. You know what, Creeper, I am tired. (speaks in foreign language) I am so fucking tired of your bullshit! You're always spending all your money on drugs. That's why we can't have nice things. Oh, really, you're gonna get some money soon? Well, you know what, I'm gonna believe it when I see it. (speaks in foreign language) Don't even bother to come here. She already fell asleep. But I hope you remember this, I don't even know why I waste my time with you. (choir sings in foreign language) What you dong out here? (Creeper) Forgot your donation. Donation? Charity, motherfucker. (gunshots blare) Damn, homie. So what happened with heina this weekend? Oh, man, bro. I told you, bro, man. She had a twin sister. Fuck, she had some big old titties or what? (Flaco) Big old titties, bro. (Negro) Dog, that's fucking crazy, homie.
