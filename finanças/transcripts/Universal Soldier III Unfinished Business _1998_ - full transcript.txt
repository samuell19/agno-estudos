(ominous ambient music) (gunfire blasting) - Secure the bodies for resurrection. The latest in biological warfare. I give you the universal soldier. Allow me to demonstrate. (gunfire blasting) (soldier groaning) - This man should be dead. - This man is dead. (aerosol spraying) - It healed. - The woman resurfaced about an hour ago in a country train station. - [Male Speaker] She's a fugitive, Mr. Mazur. Let the authorities handle her. - Whoever's behind all this made up those charges to frame her. - [Female Speaker] Who's this with Luc? - [Female Speaker] That's Luc's brother, Eric. He went to Vietnam early with a team of advisors. A year later, we got a letter. He'd been killed while visiting a French army base. (Veronica yelling) (glass shattering) - Who are you? - I'm a friend of your brother's. - [Male Speaker] What's his name? - [Male Speaker] GR44. - [Male Speaker] A troublemaker. (explosion blasting) - [Male Speaker] Not anymore. (gunfire blasting) - Take your pants off. There's a tracking device built into your leg. Unless I take it out, they're gonna find us. - Sir, GR44 is offline. - I will not have this agenda derailed. - GR44 has become the enemy. - [Agents] Affirmative. - These people will kill you. - We're not sure who's really behind it or how far out it goes, but we're going to find out. (gunfire blasting) - Why doesn't he respond? - Eric never took to the treatments. (electricity zapping) I have a friend at the CNA may still believe I'm innocent. He can't be brought back. - I want to find out who did this to us. I swear, they're not gonna get away with it. (intense industrial music) (somber choral music) (downbeat orchestral music) - Mr. McNally? - Who are you? - You called us about the grave. - Yes. But I called the cops. - And they called us. Are these the people? - Uh-huh, yeah. - Take me to where you saw them. (phone beeping) (phone dialing) They were here. - [Mentor] Why? - GR44 came to bury his brother. - Aw, he's going all sentimental on me. I'll use that. - Yes, sir. - They went in that direction. - [News Announcer] Several months of negotiations between Swiss authorities and the lawyer representing victims of the Holocaust have resulted in a substantial settlement. The amount is rumored to be in the billions and is to be paid out in gold bullion, a symbol of the original riches deposited over 50 years ago today. Today's announcement is seen as justice long overdue. (downbeat rock music) - Looks like congratulations are in order, Doctor. You're gonna be a daddy. - Hello, GR87. You hungry? Why don't we give you a little snack, hm? (computer beeping) (intense ambient music) - Rock on! (laughing) Hello! - You sure your boyfriend's gonna be here? - Ex-boyfriend. Charles covers the financial beat for CNA. He wouldn't miss a plutocratic shindig like this. - Plutocratic? - Big business. - He doesn't like business. - Charles doesn't like anyone who makes more money than he does, which is why he hates everyone. Here we go. This is Charles's van. - [Max] Okay, Charles. You're coming up on the monitor. The picture looks good. Let's check your mic out. Okay. - He's upstairs already. - [Luc] Don't even think about it. - You want to wait down here for him? - We can't risk exposure. - Exposure? This is Canada. We're not fugitives here. - Our perimeter is vulnerable. What if someone recognizes us? - We deal with it. Hey, I'm a reporter. If anything could go wrong, I'd know it. - I'll be across the street if you need me. Watch your six. Your backside. - Always. (tongue clicking) Are you okay? - I don't like heights. - Later. (upbeat dance music) (people chattering) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Datacore CEO and our host for this evening, Martin Daniels. (audience applauding) - Ladies and gentlemen, fellow media moguls, welcome to the Cyber Wealth Summit, the world's foremost exclusive gathering of the cyber community. Take a look around you. Each one of you is a captain of the information industry. Folks, you eat Fortune 500 companies for breakfast. (audience applauding) - I don't know what I hate more, this guy or my life. - Bon appetit. (audience applauding) (people chattering) (upbeat dance music) - Dump the chip on your shoulder, boss. Here comes your Pulitzer. Isn't that Roberts? - Yeah. - Oh, I have to get this on tape. - Forget it, Max. - Are you kidding me? This is a big time story. She's a fugitive. - Don't believe everything you see on TV. - [Max] Yeah, I forgot. You two used to have some-- - Stow it. She was set up. - Hello, Charles. - Let's get a drink. (people chattering) (upbeat dance music) (car horns blaring) (people chattering) - Thanks. - [Charles] What are you doing here? - I need your help. - Why didn't you phone? - I didn't think you'd take the call. - Well, just because you remailed me a Dear John doesn't mean I hate your guts. - I'm sorry. - You should be. You broke my heart. What the hell do you want? - Remember that piece we did for McKinley Dam? - Hostage job? Some covert anti-terrorist unit did the clean up. What do they call them? - Universal soldiers. - That's right. And you were dying to find out more about them, as I remember. - Well, guess what? I did. And it was a big mistake. Charles, they use dead soldiers. - (chuckling) What do you mean? - As long as their brain is intact, they can be brought back to life. - That's not possible. - It's possible. They found a way to regenerate dead tissue. - Puts a whole new spin on be all you can be. - Charles, this is the story we've been waiting all our lives to tell. (suspenseful orchestral music) (machinery beeping) - Well, you're right. It's one hell of a story. But what's your proof? - I've got one of them with me. He's downstairs. His name is Luc Devreaux. He was in Vietnam. He broke regs and he's been with me ever since Havana. You have to see him, Charles. He's like a child learning things for the first time. They erased his memory, programmed him to be the perfect soldier with battle data. That's it. - Come on, people. Let's go. We've got lots of people here. What is this? - Cake delivery. - Cake? Where are you from? (intense ambient music) (woman yelling) - Out of town. - Is this guy the only hard evidence you have? - There's a base of operations, some super soldier lab. - Where is it? - I wish I knew. It was hidden inside a cargo ship. It was in the Chicago Harbor the last time we saw it. When we went back a few days later, it was gone. It could be anywhere by now. - Do you have anybody else who can corroborate your story, someone in authority? - There was this doctor who was in charge of the program named Gregor. We met him back in Havana. He might be willing to help. - We're gonna need his cooperation. (guns cocking) - Dessert is here. - So let's party. - Party? I'm with you. - Go to hell. (gunfire blasting) (people screaming) (glass shattering) (intense rock music) (gunfire blasting) - Everybody on the ground now! Faces up and pay attention! - All right, you heard the man! Everybody, lie down! Lie down! Lie down! Get the fuck down. Get the fuck down, everybody! Lie the fuck down! Hey, you. Hey, hey, hey. Get the hell down. Do you speak English? Get your ass down! All right. Now, no one moves and no one plays hero. Anyone who does not obey does not get to sit. (gunfire blasting) (glass shattering) (intense rock music) - Operator, I'm trying to reach Eric at 504-555-2298. - [Operator] One moment please. I'm sorry, that number has been disconnected. - That's impossible. Could you please try again? (sirens blaring) - Look at all these billionaires. W-W-W-dot-geek. You and definitely you, come with me. - Where are we going? - It's time to go live, news boy. (sirens blaring) - Sir, we've got a live feed. (police radio chatter) - [Max] We're on in 10. Nine. - Not him. Her. - Veronica Roberts. She's wanted on a homicide in the States. - What's she doing in Canada? - Diversifying. Get the U.S. Embassy on the horn! - Five. - Read that. - [Max] Four. - I can't. - But you will. Otherwise, your little boyfriend here dies. - In three. Two. One. You're on. - Ladies and gentlemen, we have taken control of the convention center. (intense orchestral music) These exploiters of the world economy, ruthless brokers of the information currency, now belong to us. Our demands will soon be made clear. Any attempt to rescue the hostages will be met with extreme force. Make no mistake. We do mean business. - Come here. Come here. That was very good. Very, very good. (intense ambient music) (gunfire blasting) Well boys, I think we made our point. (static crackling) Now, you be a good little girl, stay put, and don't do anything stupid. Give me the phone. (phone beeping) - Sir. - And how are you this evening, Captain? - Veronica Roberts, right? - Wrong. She handles our PR. You'll be dealing with me from now on. - Who is this? - Who I am is irrelevant. What's important is that no more innocent people will die if you meet my one simple demand. - What do you want? - 100 million dollars. You know what? Make that 110 million unmarked in hundreds. - Hundreds. Are you insane? Do you know how much that is? - Uh-huh. And by the way, that's U.S. funds. You have got three hours. If I don't see a sea of green by then, you see a sea of red. One dead fat cat every 10 minutes. Do I make myself clear? - Yes. - That should keep him busy, huh? - I've just been given an update on the hostage situation here at the convention center in Toronto. It has been confirmed that the hostage who was shot only a few minutes ago is Charles Clifton of CNA News. One of the terrorists has been identified as Veronica Roberts, a former employee of CNA News and apparently a fugitive from justice in the United States. Right now, authorities are evacuating the lower floors. (intense ambient music) (static crackling) (typing on keyboard) - Ladies and gentlemen, let's get down to business, shall we? Our software's been modified to accept your pin numbers. Rest assured that your account's confidentiality will be respected. Now what I want you all to do is line up over here and when our account confirms your generous transfer of five million dollars each, you will be set free and this whole ordeal will be over. - Always has to be the top floor. - Now, those of you who don't comply get to appear in front of the camera. Now, what'll it be? (intense guitar music) (suspenseful ambient music) (doors creaking) (machinery beeping) - [Luc] Overheating. - Yes, you heard me right. She said 110. Yes, I know how much that is! - Who are you? - I'm the bus boy. - Where are the others? - In the main dining room. (downbeat rock music) (coins clattering) (bell dinging) - Can I go now? - You don't want to go now, honey. They think you're one of us. (coins clattering) (bell dinging) (glass shattering) Go! - Hello. - [Male Speaker] Who the hell are you? - I'm just the bus boy. - Let's go. - [Grace] Who the hell is this? - [Male Speaker] He's just the bus boy. - That's what Sirhan Sirhan said. Where'd he come from? We cleared the kitchen. - I was hiding. (static crackling) - Check it again. You must lift some pretty heavy dishes. Baby! Mmm. - Okay, let's go. - [Male Speaker] All right, man. Don't shoot. - Mmm. - Look what else I found. - [Grace] And who the hell is this? - He says he's the bus boy. (Grace sniffing) - He's a cop. Kill him. Quietly. (man groaning) (thudding) (intense rock music) - All hell is breaking loose. Go, go, go! (thudding) (man groaning) (gunfire blasting) (intense rock music) (thudding) - No! - She's with me. ♪ Just trash ♪ ♪ Trash ♪ ♪ It's just trash ♪ ♪ Trash ♪ - Are you nuts? I thought you were scared of heights. - Hang on. - [News Announcer] And now for an update on the hostage crisis, we go live from the scene. Fred? - The hostage situation at the convention center has come to a violent end not by police, but by a single man. Witnesses are describing him as a real life comic book superhero. - This guy was all business from the get go. He came in there, kicked some serious tail, and then he was gone. - By the time authorities took control, there was no sign of the hero or former CNA reporter Veronica Roberts. However, she is still a fugitive in the United States and police have confirmed that a manhunt is underway. - [Mentor] Did you watch the news? - [Dr. Walker] Our boy has been busy. - Yeah. Well, you better unbusy him as soon as possible because his existence continues to compromise our operation. I find that unacceptable. - Yes, sir. - Our mission will not be impeded by him or any other element. - No, sir. - Good. That's the way I like to hear you talk. - Last week, a consortium of four Swiss banks confirmed the release of 10 billion dollars in gold to be divided amongst survivors of the Holocaust. Distribution will be overseen by the UN. Tight security is reported around the gold bullion shipments which will be flown to the United States by the US Air Force. Departure and destination details are highly classified. (train horn blaring) - I feel like I'm in quicksand. (aerosol spraying) Every time we try to make things right, something goes wrong. They're gonna pin Charles's death on me too, I know it. What is it? (intense ambient music) You haven't heard a word I've said, have you? - I have to get home. - As soon as we stop, we'll get our car, get outta here. (intense ambient music) - [Male Speaker] He's here. - General Clancy. I appreciate your coming over so quickly. - Not a problem, sir. You said it was urgent. - Yes, indeed. I'm told that you're in charge of security over at Dover Air Force Base. - That's correct, sir. - Well then, I need a favor. - What's that, sir? - I need you to die. (gunfire blasting) Don't worry. It's only temporary. - He's got to be kidding. I asked for soldiers. He sends me criminals. Take them to the med lab. - Relentless and ruthless. He'll be perfect for Golden Harvest. No, how is our pet project coming? - The blood samples came back. Positive. - And the memory problem? - I've alleviated that, sir. I've altered his DNA by omitting all imperfections. You see, my creating a clone, it's as though we've started from scratch. - Well, I hope you're right because there's no margin for error. I want that GR mobile right away. - This one's going to take some time, sir. - Oh, some time. Well, that's something you've got plenty of, Doctor. Maybe decades and decades of it behind bars if we don't find that reporter and GR44 right away. (intense orchestral music) (train horn blaring) - Who's that? - [Male Speaker] That was Dr. Walker's wife. - Wife? - When a man marries a woman, she becomes a wife. It's time for your booster. - I don't like needles. - You need it to help you get big and strong. Don't worry. It won't hurt a bit. You may feel a little drowsy. He's ready for you. (downbeat rock music) - Passport? Okay. Passport? - [Jasper] You think he'll know what it is when he recovers? - No. I told him it was just a simple upgrade. - Never used explosives before. - [Dr. Walker] No, Jasper. It's our insurance. (machinery beeping) (explosion blasting) - [Jasper] Cool. (intense ambient music) - What the hell are you doing to me? - Calm down. - [Male Speaker Over Radio] Dr. Walker? - What is it? - [Male Speaker Over Radio] You better come in here. - I'm busy. - One of the recruits isn't responding to the memory clearance. Looks like we've got a resurrection failure. (gunfire blasting) (machinery beeping) (buzzer blaring) - They're dead, aren't they? - Yes, yes, they are. And so are you. - What the hell? - Son, just try and stay calm. Everything's going to be okay. - Okay? I'm dead. Everything is not okay! I want out of here. (gun cocking) Now. (suspenseful orchestral music) What the hell's going on?! Let me out of here! - Make a note. (gunfire blasting) (bullet ricocheting) GR85 did not take to the program. Gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet. (alarm blaring) (man screaming) - Don't go over 65, Luc. We can't afford to get pulled over. - Something's wrong, I can feel it. - There's no reason for them to go after your parents. They're civilians. They did nothing wrong. - Their phone's been disconnected. - Maybe they didn't pay their phone bill. I'm sorry. Look, there's gotta be a reasonable explanation. - General Clancy, nice to see you again. How are you feeling? - Very good, sir. - Very good. Sit down. We have much to discuss. (car engine rumbling) (deliberative ambient music) (birds chirping) (somber guitar music) - I'm so sorry. You're feeling sad, Luc. It's normal. It's called loss. - Loss? - Loss tears you up inside. It happens when you love someone and then they're gone. - I felt loss when Eric died. - It's like a piece to your heart that's suddenly missing. You don't feel whole anymore. You're becoming human again. It's okay to be sad. - No home. No family. It's over. - No, Luc. We're not going to let them win. - I don't have anyone. - We have each other. - No more loss. - Luc, listen to me. We are not going to lose each other. We're gonna find Dr. Gregor, get him to testify, and end this thing. - No more loss. - [Veronica] Luc? - Need cold. (machinery beeping) (tires squealing) (deliberative ambient music) - Can I help you? - Where's your cold storage? - [Clerk] It's in the back, why? - I just need to borrow it. - Well, wait a minute. You can't go back there. Look, you can't. This isn't safe. My boss is just gonna... I don't know if I... Is he okay? Look, lady, he's gonna freeze to death in here. - No, actually, he's gonna get better. - Oh really? (suspenseful orchestral music) Hi, I caught that lady reporter you've been looking for. Veronica Roberts, that's right. Yeah, she's here. She's in my freezer. (birds chirping) - Soldiers, I am here talking to you personally because of the importance of this mission. Operation Golden Harvest is an integral part of our survival! Now, the soldier on that monitor is GR86, our inside operative. GR86 will be your strike force leader. Now, make no mistake about it. Your targets will be well fortified. I'm estimating at least five regular Air Force sentries for every one of you. (suspenseful ambient music) (siren blaring) (lock clattering) - Shit. Luc, Luc, wake up. We have to get out of here. (tires squealing) - Dave, Dave, come on. I got 'em locked up in the back here. - You're sure it's the right group? - Oh yeah, it's her, it's her. I know it's her. And say, there's a reward for turning this woman in. - Settle down, settle down. - [Clerk] There's a big guy with her. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Okay missy, come on. Come on. (thudding) (officer groaning) (glass shattering) (clerk groaning) (clattering) (cash register dinging) - Help yourself. (tires squealing) - Good morning, son. - Good morning, sir. - How are you feeling today? - My chest hurts, sir. - Oh well, let me see. - Why did you do this to me, sir? - To protect you, and us. What's with this sir nonsense, huh? I want you to be comfortable around me. In fact, I want you to think of me as a dad. - What's a dad? - A dad is someone who gives you life, takes care of you. I'm dad. The only dad in your life. Understand? Good. - Your wife is dead. - Yes. Yes, she is. Well, I see you're doing your homework. - Yes, dad. - Tactical machine pistol, cartridge type? - Nine millimeter Parabellum. - Magazine capacity? - 25 rounds. Rate of fire, 500 rounds per minute. - Very good. Now, which one of these is the enemy? - GR44. - GR44 is a threat to our family. He is our greatest enemy. - He is our greatest enemy. - That's my boy. - It's just like a trigger. Keep squeezing until it's done, okay? I'll be right back. - Hey buddy, can you fill her up? - Veteran's Administration? - [Secretary] Yes, it is. - Hello, I'm looking for a doctor Christopher Gregor. - [Secretary] Transferring your call to records. - [Records] May I help you? - Yeah. I'm looking for Dr. Christopher Gregor. - [Records] Oh, one moment please. I see that he's been transferred to Canton Veteran Hospital in Pennsylvania. - Thank you. (phone beeping) - Call anytime. - What are you doing? - Windows. - Come on. (engine rumbling) (tires squealing) I don't believe it. You took their money? - Plastic too. (engine rumbling) (downbeat rock music) (guns cocking) (tires squealing) - No, no, no, no, no. You can't take a gun into the hospital. - How do we protect ourselves? - We'll deal with it. Besides, Dr. Gregor's our friend. - Maybe Dr. Gregor can tell us who his boss is. - Now you're thinking like a reporter. (intense ambient music) (downbeat rock music) - Let me tell you something, Angel. Guys with one arm, they make the best lovers. - (chuckling) I'll have to remember that. - No, no, no. Look, I'm not kidding, baby. Just because I got one less arm doesn't mean I can't hug you, right? Plus, plus, I got two good feet that just won't quit, huh? Here, check it out. Huh? Huh? (laughing) - Still got it, Scully. - [Scully] She digs me. - We're looking for a friend of ours, Dr. Christopher Gregor. Is he on duty? - He doesn't practice here. He's a patient. Alzheimer's is not uncommon in a man his age. - [Veronica] When did this happen? - Very recently, about a week ago. He started to show signs of significant memory loss. (downbeat rock music) (gunfire blasting) (tire hissing) - Commence target scan. - [Physician] Dr. Gregor, I have two friends here to see you. - Do I know you? - It's me, Veronica Roberts. This is GR44. We came to see you a few weeks ago in Utah. We need some answers about the universal soldier program you used to run. - What's a universal soldier? (woman gasping) (downbeat rock music) - Dr. Gregor, I'd like to leave a number where you can reach me just in case you remember anything at all. I don't believe it. Luke, take a look at this. - Memory clearance. - What's going on? (downbeat rock music) - What kind of medication do you have Dr. Gregor on? - None. Why? - He doesn't have Alzheimer's. - You're right. I erased his memory. - Andy, the fuck you doing? Put the gun down. - Shut up. - Damn, brother. You gone postal? - Another word and you can die first. Now we're all gonna leave here nice and quiet. - Catch! (gun clattering) (intense ambient music) - [Luc] Thanks for the hand. - Go ahead, shoot me. They'll just bring me back to life. - What's he talking about? - He's a sleeper. - What's a sleeper? - Non-combative unit. Civilians. They wait until they're called upon. - We're everywhere. (gunfire blasting) - Go! Go! - GR83 just killed a civilian and a friendly. - GR83, I gave orders to keep collateral damage to a minimum. (gunfire blasting) Fucking criminals. - Down. (gunfire blasting) Watch your six. (intense electronic music) (gunfire blasting) - Who the hell are you two? - The good guys. Come on. - Shit, this is just like Mekong. - Except for the heat. - Luc. The bitch is back. Oh, shit. (gunfire blasting) - Fire in the hole! (gunfire blasting) (deliberative choral music) - Get down. (gunfire blasting) (liquid splashing) (gunfire blasting) (bullet clinking) (gunfire blasting) - Shit! (man groaning) That was a brand new arm. (gunfire blasting) (explosion blasting) (deliberative choral music) Keep going. You can get up to the roof that way. - We're not gonna leave you. - Oh, fuck the hero crap. I'm not gonna make it. Just go. (shelf crashing) That's an order, soldier! (man groaning) Run, run! (gun clicking) (gunfire blasting) (glass shattering) (downbeat rock music) (glass shattering) (gunfire blasting) - GR83, do not let them leave. (glass shattering) (gunfire blasting) GR82, stop them. (gunfire blasting) - Oh, man! (thudding) (tires squealing) - He probably didn't feel it. - No, we lost picture. - Damn it. We cannot afford to lose a unit. Not now. - GR83, identify. - Pull of sticks. I want everyone out of there now. - What about 82? - Priority is Operation Golden Harvest. I want everyone back to the base! (somber orchestral music) (thudding) - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh what? - Pull over. (tires squealing) (thudding) (metal squeaking) Luc? - What is it? - We've got a hitchhiker. Why don't we just get back in the car? Luc? Is he alive? - Barely. - Terminate GR44. (glass shattering) - Are you out of your mind? - I can't leave him out in the middle of the street. - Yes, that's exactly what you can do. - He's dying. - He died a long time ago. I say we dump him in front of a police station with a note. - We're keeping him. - For god's sake, this isn't a stray kitten, Luc. This thing is a killing machine. - Exactly. And the best way to fight an army is with an ally. - What happens if it doesn't work? What if we fix him and he still wants to kill us? - We deal with it. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Are you sure this is gonna work? - There's a week's worth of memory clearance drug in here. Enough to wipe out a few directives. Now all we have to do is reprogram him. Help me get him in that freezer. - You know, what about the hard drive? Whatever he knows, whatever he's seen, it's on this thing. There's gotta be something on here we can use. - Now you're thinking like a reporter. - I am a reporter. That line doesn't work on me. See, when I said it to you, it worked because you're not a reporter, you were just thinking like one. Forget it. - It's damaged, but maybe we can still get something out of it. (machinery beeping) (typing on keyboard) (static crackling) - [Mentor] Once we get on the site, neutralize security at all checkpoints. - Who the hell is that? Why won't GR82 look up? - [Mentor] Operation Golden Harvest. - Operation Golden Harvest? - [Mentor] Extraction point is Warner Air Force Base in Dover. - Dover? That's in Delaware. What are they gonna do there? - I don't know, but it sounds like a major operation. - Look up, you idiot. What's with the crotch shot? - GR82 is seated in the cooling chamber at attention which is why his eyeline is at waist level. - Don't you guys ever break the rules? - [Mentor] The Air Force base is presumed impermeable. Radio silence. Deliver the gold to our rendezvous point. - Gold? - I expect nothing less-- - Oh my god. They're gonna rob that Swiss gold shipment going to the UN. - I expect nothing less. - Luc, did you hear me? That gold is worth billions. If they get their hands on that kind of money, they could set up a Unisol assembly line and... (typing on keyboard) What is it? - This. - All I see is a ring. - This was a symbol for Spektor Company, my old unit in Vietnam. - This guy was a soldier with you? - There was only one person that wore that ring. - [Male Speaker] Ten-hut! (soft guitar music) (helicopter whirring) - [Veronica] Who is he, Luc? - I don't know. I can see him but I can't remember his name. (box rattling) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Nap time's over. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Stand down, soldier. GR82, it's good to have you back in action. - Good to be back, sir. - At ease, soldier. You may address me as Sergeant Devreaux or Sir. I will be your new commanding officer. - Affirmative. What is my first assignment, sir? - Payback. (suspenseful orchestral music) - What happened to the lights? Time for your booster. (thudding) (groaning) - I told you. I don't like needles. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Male Speaker] Ten-hut! (helicopter whirring) (soft guitar music) - I'm sure you men are wondering why you were brought here. You-- (water splashing) (soft guitar music) Special detail. You are the best and the brightest the military has to offer. - [Luc] Colonel Risco. - Who? - The man with the ring. His name is Colonel Gerald Risco. - That's impossible. - You know him? - Gerald Risco is the Deputy Director of the CIA. You were all named after him. I always thought the initials GR stood for genetic regeneration. Gerald Risco. This is big. (helicopter whirring) - Approach, this is lima 116. Requesting approach authorization. - Roger, 116. You're clear for approach. Runway 019. Welcome home. (aircraft whirring) Right on schedule, sir. - I know. (gunfire blasting) - This is General Clancy, Security Chief at Dover to all aircraft on this frequency. Maintain radio silence for the next 15 minutes. The field will be closed until further notice. (downbeat rock music) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Son, I'm very proud of you. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Second team to quarterback. We're on the bench. - Roger that. Okay, team. Let's make some noise and score some points. - We're cool. - Do it. (sparks crackling) - We're in. - Yeah. Have you recovered GR82 yet? - We're still working on it, sir. (fence clattering) - [Grace] We're in the red zone. (sparks crackling) (downbeat rock music) - [Mentor] How does it look? - Glorious. (downbeat rock music) - How long before you're ready to fly this plane out of here, captain? - Should be fuel and airborne within 15 minutes, General. (gunfire blasting) - Game over. Everybody off the field. (gunfire blasting) - Checkpoint one all clear. (gunfire blasting) (thudding) - Checkpoint two all clear. (gunfire blasting) (thudding) - Checkpoint three all clear. (door whirring) (suspenseful orchestral music) - We got it, sir. We are in the playoffs. (Mentor sighing) - [Luc] The Unisols have completed their assault. - What are we gonna do? - It's time we get GR82 back to his unit. (propellors whirring) - We can't let that plane leave. - Come on. (engine rumbling) (tires squealing) (explosion blasting) (downbeat rock music) - [Jasper] It's GR44. - No! This is not going to happen again! - Head for the tower. Radio for help. (suspenseful orchestral music) (door whirring) - Time to show your stuff, son! (helicopter whirring) - [GR82] Nice night for a walk. - It's GR82. Hey, he's back, GR82! - It's about time. (gunfire blasting) (explosion blasting) - I think he's been hanging with the wrong crowd. We have a breach of security. (electricity zapping) (men groaning) Repeat, we have a breach of security.

That was for Charles. (intense rock music) (thudding) (Luc groaning) (deliberative rock music) - Eric? - Look at his face. It's beautiful. It's like a deer trapped in the headlights. And he doesn't know what to do. - Target confirmed. - Kill him. (thudding) (Luc groaning) - Losing your red, soldier. (thudding) (Luc groaning) Come on, you can do better than that. - Eric, what have they done? - My name is G (thudding) R (thudding) eight (thudding) (thudding) (Luc groaning) seven. (thudding) (Luc groaning) Gee. (thudding) (Luc groaning) (glass shattering) - What the hell's going on here? - I'm not having any fun. - Okay. How's this? - GR87, stop playing games. Finish him. - The photograph! - Now, will you listen to me?! That's us! We had the same mother and father! We're brothers! - He's lying. - Remember, Eric, remember! - [Dr. Walker] GR87, do you copy? - Remember. - [Dr. Walker] Reply! - We're brothers. They killed our mother and father. We're a family. - Do not listen to him. I am your only family. I'm dad. - Family. - He's going recall. - Impossible. - They killed them. Our mother and our father, they killed them. - GR87, you must kill GR44 now! I repeat, now! (static crackling) - Luc. - Eric. - Luc. (Eric laughing) - Brothers. - Brothers. - What do we do now? - Time to cash in our insurance policy. (suspenseful orchestral music) (machinery beeping) (intense orchestral music) Forgive me, son. (machinery beeping) - What is it? What is it? - A bomb. - Oh my god. - What's the blast zone? - 20 yards. They're all dead. - Eric. - No, stay. - Eric. - Stay! Stay, Luc! - Eric! - No! - Eric! - No! (machinery beeping) You bastards! (machinery beeping) (explosion blasting) (imitating explosion) (somber ambient music) - Status, Jasper. - [Jasper] GR87 is offline. - What about GR44 and the woman? (typing on keyboard) (machinery beeping) - Your life is over. - They're both alive, sir. (tires squealing) - Colonel Risco. - GR44, right? - No. My name is Luc Devreaux. - Well, what your name is is not relevant. - Why did you kill my family? - You better wake up now, son. This is about the wellbeing of the American people. And when Americans go to sleep at night, they like to know they're safe. They want to know that there's people out there protecting them. People like us. They don't want to get letters saying their sons and their daughters are missing in action, or wounded, or dead! That's why the universal soldier was perfect, because then they wouldn't be getting a body bag with their sons and their daughters in 'em. So you see we have something here that can take the place of their sons and daughters. And you can see now why any kind of sacrifice that had to be made, that's a small price to pay. Understand, son? - No, I don't understand. - Well, that's too bad because you're a soldier. You should have followed your orders. - Did you get all that? - I got it. (intense orchestral music) - You're making a mistake. Now give me the tape. - There is no tape. We're live. - Wait. Hold it. Don't move. (intense ambient music) (loud crashing) (glass shattering) (downbeat piano music) (sirens blaring) (hammer thudding) - [Veronica] Gerald Risco was buried in an unmarked grave branded an embarrassment to his country. Although the charges against me were dropped, the CIA and congress denied any knowledge of the universal soldier project. The Unisol base of operations was never found, so Luc and I continue to live in fear. We're sure there are more of them out there. (helicopter whirring) (intense choral music) (chamber whirring) - Welcome back, sir. How are you feeling? - Excellent. - Good. First order of business, sir? - Make the sleepers. - Unisols, report in! (car horns blaring) - [GR77] GR77 online. - Hello. - [GR71] GR71 online. - Welcome home. - [GR76] GR76 online. - Talk to daddy. - [GR80] GR80 online. - [GR72] GR72 online. - Thank you, gentlemen.
