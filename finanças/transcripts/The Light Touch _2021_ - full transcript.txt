(crickets chirping) (light jazzy music) (siren blaring in distance) (cars revving) (tourists chattering) (cameras clicking) (clicking) (smooching) - She stole my wallet! (energetic percussive music) Hey! Gotcha! My name is Wesley Stankovich. I'm a police detective with New Scotland Yard. I don't care if it doesn't sound British! No, I'm on holiday. My pocket has just been picked and I have a photograph of the culprit. Now can I have some men over here immediately? My identification? She got that too. And my passport. - I know it sounds simple-minded. But the first step in the cure is to stop stealing. You have to take that step or it won't work. - I don't want it to work. I don't come here to be cured. I come here to talk to somebody. - [Psychiatrist] Talk to your father. - He'd have a nervous breakdown! Why are you still in real estate when there's a depression going on? - No, the market's coming back. You haven't asked me for money lately. How are you surviving? - I get by. - The lives of children are invisible to their parents. And the lives of parents are invisible to their children. - I haven't been a child for a very long time, papa. - I hadn't noticed. - Do you want me to move out? - Why? - So you can have your invisible life. - I do have my invisible life. Where would you live? - I'm very independent. - Well since you're talking to me, I want you to confront the truth and deal with it. You are a kleptomaniac. - I do deal with it. I can't resist. It's so thrilling. But I only steal from the rich, like you. - I don't steal. - You take all this money per hour per 50 minutes to tell me I'm a kleptomaniac. And then you say that's not stealing. Where do you think I get the money to pay for this? It comes out of their pockets and into yours. (speaks in foreign language) Scotland Yard? Oh, I say. Gah, these Brits are a pain in the ass. Tell him to go to his embassy. What? So what are we supposed to do, hold his hand? This is not lost and found. So, we'll have to catch his thief for him. No, sorry, I cannot spare any men. This is the tourist season. (train whooshing) - [Psychiatrist] If you don't like the term kleptomaniac, can we say that you're obsessive about stealing? - Enthusiastic. (train chugging) - [Becky] Excuse me. - [Psychiatrist] All right. Tell me about the new girl. That's what you really wanna talk about. - Hmmm. She's got a wholesomeness that's positively offensive. I adore her. - [Psychiatrist] After one look? - That's how it happens. - [Psychiatrist] Well, not to everyone. - To me. (energetic percussive music) ♪ And I will kiss your forever ♪ ♪ And I will love you forever ♪ - Can you cure me? - You don't want to be cured. What are you doing here? - You're my mother. I need a mother. (speaks in foreign language) (phone slamming) How is your English, Gina? - Ah, I'm speaking from very good English. - Uh huh. I'm taking you off traffic duty. There's a British policeman in town and he's had his pocket picked. I want you to liaise with him and try to help him get his wallet back. They've got his details somewhere outside. You can call him and tell him where to meet you. - Yes, sir, Captain. - Wait a minute! Take off that uniform. - You mean here, now? - No. I mean I don't want you to be in uniform. Not you. You are now a plainclothes person. It's a promotion. You like that, huh? Just take care of that Brit. - Yes, yes. Thank you very much, little Captain. - (sighing) Christ. - Time's up. Mommy wants her money. (insects chirping) (Gina clears throat) - No, thanks. - Are you waiting for someone? - Yes, and you'd better not be here when he arrives. Look, I happen to be a police officer. - So am I! (dinging) - Ah. (crowd chattering) - A cop! - There must be something on her. She's not a first-timer. She knows how to do this. If she has a passport or an ID card it will be in the computer. Here, take this. I'll keep looking. You get that to headquarters. - Okay. (energetic percussive music) - [Wesley] Hey!

Total desire, total impulse. Even I sometimes doubt that it's real. I'm here to examine it. - Tell me one of your dreams. Make me feel I'm earning my money. (light piano music) - She's in the stadium, the big marble one, sitting at the inner end way up high, overlooking the world, holding a parasol to keep the sun off her. Her legs are crossed, her feet are bare. She's entirely self-sufficient. She needs no one. In the distance, I enter from the street. It's like Lawrence of Arabis where the dot in the horizon turns into a horseman riding towards us. - [Psychiatrist] You see your dreams as movies? - Dreams are movies. Movies are dreams. It's masochistic, isn't it? - [Psychiatrist] Falling in love is a masochistic thing to do. - God, you're a pessimist. You know, that's why I pay you all this money. So I can struggle with you, so I can resist you, so I can defeat you. - Go on. Proceed with your humiliation by this innocent and uncaring young person. (light piano music) - That's what's happening, all right. I don't know why. I need you to please have mercy on this feeling I have for you! I need real mercy! Can you please just allow yourself to feel a little mercy? Don't you see what I go through for you? I love you! - [Psychiatrist] You treat this situation as if it was something you owned. It doesn't mean anything to her. - Yeah. Yeah. (cars honking in distance) (tires screeching) (upbeat jazz music) - I don't have any money. - I don't want your money. - What do you want? - It's kind of embarrassing to say. - You may as well. - I love you. - Well, that's very nice. - No, it's not. I'm making a fool of myself chasing you around. I had to tell you. I had to see you again. I love seeing you. Is that all right? - Well, no, I wouldn't say it's all right. You're a woman, which is a bit unusual, and you're a thief, which I hope you don't mind my saying is something that I really don't want any part of. - I was thinking we could have coffee. I'm a brilliant personality. You'll really like me. - That's one very good reason not to have coffee with you. I don't want to like you. I don't, forgive me for saying this, even want to know you. - If it were anybody else but me, I would say I couldn't blame you. But I'm really not the person you think I am. - You're not a lesbian pickpocket? - Well that's not so bad. - Excuse me. - 15 minutes and I'll never bother you again. - Uh-uh. - Hey. You, do you know this woman? - No, she's harassing me. - You are under arrest for, is harassment against the law in this country? - No. - Yes, it is. - No, it isn't. - You are under arrest for stealing my wallet, my passport and my police identification card which I would like to have back now, please. - You can't blame me because you lost your wallet. What makes you think it was me? - You took it when you rubbed up against me. - You rubbed up against me, you pervert! You think you can use your authority as a police officer to put your hands all over young women? - I did no such thing. - Yeah, well it's not gonna sound too good in court when I tell them what you did to me. You think you can come on vacation to a foreign country and the rules don't apply? You people have been victimizing us for centuries! Give us back the Elgin Marbles and stop looking at my breasts! - [Wesley] Enough, shut up! - He touched me at the Acropolis and chased me down here! To touch me again! - I'm warning you! (bashing) Aaagh! (wheezing) (solemn chanting music) - Miranda. Where have you been? - Never very far. - I don't know. You haven't come to church lately. And you used to confess to me. When was the last time that happened? Perhaps you have nothing to confess. - I don't know. I don't know what sin is anymore. - Is it because you're discovering new ones? Or is it because you're outgrowing the church? Take your own way, my young friend, but don't outgrow me. How's your mother? (insects chirping) - Why don't you ever get dressed? - It's too hot to get dressed. And I don't look good in clothes. Virginia Woolf said, "The older one grows, the more one likes indecency." - She never goes out. She's in love with herself. - She has good taste. She misses your father. - So do I. - Here I am. (doorbell dinging) - I lost my keys. (door buzzing) (sighing) I need some money. I lost everything. - This is the only time you remember to come home. This has got to stop. - I know. - [Mom] How much? - 50. A hundred. - I should have buzzed. I think you dropped these. And this, Miranda. It's a beautiful name. It's really not the money that I want. - I wish it were. It's all right, I found it. Thank you very much. I don't feel this situation calls for a reward. - I don't want that either. - Can we please not discuss what you want? - Well, who's this? - Hi. I'm Becky. Miranda dropped her stuff and I just, where did she go? - I don't know. - When will she be back? - Not today. She doesn't live here. - [Becky] Where does she live? - She doesn't tell me. She doesn't approve of me. - She's not easy to please. - You seem to know her. - Well. (bell tolling in distance) (dog barking) - The meter's running. - The mother's a slut. Do you think there could be a slut inside Miranda waiting to be released? - I don't know, I would have to see her. - Do you think slut is a judgemental word? - Well you used it. You must mean something by it. - Yes, I'm confused. I'm totally random, totally uncontrolled. (somber piano music) There's no structure to my life. I'm wandering aimlessly, distracted by this, distracted by that. - Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. Perhaps I should have you committed. - I've lost a lot of ground. - You're going to see her again? She could have you arrested for stalking. - It's not illegal here. - Not by the letter of the law. But if they want you for it, they'll get you. - Ah, but you see, she hasn't reported me. - [Psychiatrist] How do you know? - Because if she had, there'd be more people after me than just the Brit. She hasn't reported me. She loves me. (somber piano music) - Romantics like Chopin crave solitary experience. Yet, they can't stand being alone. All right, that was good. I'd rather have you place your fingers like this. (somber piano music) - You're having a fantasy. You seek someone who embodies that fantasy. But it's impossible she can do it for long. Fantasy's a secret place we live. But, we must reconcile it with what we have. It's a dangerous business. - Life, my dear doctor, is contradictions. That's all it is. Illogical, stupid. (light piano music) - You know, you played that so beautifully. I'm going to give you a little kiss for a reward. - I cannot allow myself to be made a fool of by a girl. The reputation of the British Police Force is at stake. The reputation of Britain is at stake. - You are quite right. - I know I'm right. - (gasping) You're so brave. I'm here to help you. - So, you've been stuck with taking care of the crazy Brit, hmm? - It is my duty, and my pleasure. I'm on your side. - Did you get any matches on the photograph? - No. Not all the identity cards have been computerized yet. Nor the passports. Perhaps tomorrow? Though I doubt it. But it's okay, we will find her, don't worry. For now, it is important that we are vigilant. We are on the job. Are you married? - [Wesley] Yes. - Do you have children? - [Wesley] No. - Don't you want children? - I haven't thought about it lately. - Why don't you have children? - Just hasn't. - So, you need someone who can give you children then! - I can't read this menu. What does this say? - So, do you want children or don't you? - Yes, yes, but that's not at the forefront right now. At the forefront right now is getting something to eat and catching that girl! - No, we are not going to catch the girl tonight. - Why not? - No. Because it's too dark. We will not be able to see anything. And anyway, the girl is back at home. Alone. In the bed. - Look, I don't want to see fountains. I want to find the girl. - Fountains are symbols! - Of what? That's a little pagan, isn't it? - And you're on vacation. So, where is your wife? - I'm not on vacation anymore. I've got one mission, to find that thief. - If we catch all the criminals, we will finish by landing ourselves in jail. - What kind of police officer are you? - The kind who when I arrest you, you don't mind. - Hey! (dramatic music) (Wesley growling) (sultry music) - It's not your fault. You're under so much pressure. - This is not typical of me. - No? I've always thought that the British are so conservative. - Well, not me. - I'm the afraid one. Defenseless in a strange man's bed. Without clothes on. Nude. With an Englishman. (sultry music) - Aren't you taking pictures? - I'm not really into that. I'd rather just feel it. - How original. Are you Greek? - Half. - What's the other half? - American. - Ah, not much of a presence anymore in the world, America. - We can still kick your ass. - Sounds exciting. May I invite you for some coffee? - Gosh. I don't even know you. - Shall I tell you about myself? - Will it take long? - I like you. I am rich. But don't kidnap me or anything. There's no one to pay the ransom. (sighing) I'm all alone. - Why are you coming on to me? - Ah, that, you have to ask the kaiser. The moment I saw you the kaiser told me he wanted you. He said "Hey, Friedrich!" He called me Friedrich, I don't know why, that's not my name. So he said "Hey, Friedrich, you're not going to let this one go by, are you?" I kept walking. But he said "Friedrich, what are you doing? Speak to that woman. Let's at least be close to her." You are very beautiful, don't you agree? - No. - But you must. - It wouldn't be polite. Fritz. - Gerhard. - I'd better call you by your real name. Fritz, I've got to go. - But can we meet somewhere? Can I call you? You've got a telephone number? Okay. See you around. - Look, I think we should spread out. There are only two of us but we can still cover twice the area if we work separately. And I've got a map and I think I can manage this immediate vicinity. You take this neighborhood and we can rendezvous here, yes? - Yes, if you insisit. Can we meet for lunch? - I don't want to think about lunch. - Yes, but we have to think about lunch. This is Greece. And afterwards, we have a nap. - He is rich. (chuckling) - Don't say hey. (slamming) - Hey! (upbeat jazz music) (light music) (shower trickling) (kooky music) (somber piano music) (sighing) - [Dad] Where are you getting your money? - Men! - [Dad] What men? - Men! (door slamming) - See? The afternoon nap. It restores us. - I'd like to get back to work now. - It must be your Slavic blood. It's just not British, the way you make love. - It's a physical function, don't dwell on it. - You are British. - She came to my house. She followed me and let herself into my house. - She wants to see who you are. - She's playing my game. - Exactly, it's a game. Don't make too much out of it. - She took some risks to do that. - It would have been riskier if she did not do that. You're a danger to her. - I know. - She has to deal with that. She's more mature than you are. She makes decisions and she acts on them. - You went to school to learn this stuff, huh? - [Psychiatrist] That's right. - So wishful. You think in terms of decisions, of freedom of choice. The rest of us do what we have to. - Have you read Freud? It doesn't matter, I've read Freud. "Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love, have, so to speak, pawned a part of their narcissism." - Not bad. - You don't want to face the truth about yourself. - The truth is hard to come by and overrated. The truth is, I don't know what the truth is. - What do you have to offer this girl? You're a pickpocket. - You have to be a pickpocket to get what you want in life. Frankly, I forgive myself. - You mean you know what you want? - Right now I do. - Get in! - [Wesley] Where is Gina? - Gina cannot drive. - You left before I could offer you any hospitality. - Oh, no, I was royally entertained. - I'm afraid my father's a little... - It must run in the family. - I'm not like that all the time. - Just with me and my mother. - Look, I'm sorry. - It's all right. She's very beautiful. - That runs in your family. Otherwise, you don't seem- - No, we're not very much alike. Of course, when you hang us in the meat market, the differences do blur. - You're right, you're absolutely right. Let's go take a look. Oh, don't worry, there are plenty of people in there to protect you. - [Wesley] That's them, that's them! - That one's me. You see that one? Look how I'm bleeding inside. It's awful, my heart all poured out! And there's your mother. Shapely but, how should I say? Surrendering a little too eagerly, too on the hook. Still, she'd be delicious with roast potatoes. (tense music) (snorting) And there's you. An innocent lamb, only yesterday frolicking in the pasture. Let's get outta here. - Shouldn't you get back to stealing? - There's time. The thing about stealing is that you're your own boss. You can appreciate the magical moments in life. Time is always slow, always infinite. - So this is your work? You don't want to do anything else? - I could become a lawyer or a banker and steal at a higher level. Seems like a lot of trouble though. - Do you know what Coco Chanel said? - I can't wait. - She said that some people think that luxury is the opposite of poverty. It's not. It's the opposite of vulgarity. - Ouch. (door shutting) - I have to practice. (light piano music) - [Wesley] That's her, that's her! Stop the car! Stop the bloody car! - Take it easy! - [Wesley] Would you please stop the fucking car? (sighing) Hey! Who was that? - I don't know. - [Wesley] She's always with you. - [Miranda] I can't get rid of her. - [Wesley] What's your name? - Miranda. - Do you have any identification, Miranda? - I'd like you to call me when you see her again. - I'm not an informer. May I have my ID card back? - She's a criminal. - Catch her. - [Wesley] That's what I'm trying to do. - I'm afraid I can't help you. - Well don't help her or you'll be a criminal too. - Why did you do that? - Didn't you want me to? - You know I did. - Well, I did it. - You're implicated. You've aided a fugitive from justice and I love you. - Don't get carried away. - My name is Becky. - I don't want to know. And don't follow me outside. He's waiting for you. (light jazz music) (Becky gasping) - We simply must get out of here. Come, I'll take you to paradise. (birds chirping) - Why are you persisting? - Love is involuntary. - Love is giving. - No, love is something that you feel. It's dangerous to think of it as giving, you start to want things back. - I don't feel it. - [Becky] Do you know Shelley? - [Miranda] I know who he is. - "The fountains mingle with the river and the rivers with the ocean. The winds of heaven mix forever with the sweet emotion. And the sunlight clasps the earth, and the moonbeams kiss the sea. What are all these kissings worth if thou kiss not me?" - Hey! (upbeat kooky music) (grunting) (sloshing) (grunting) Fuck this! Fuck this! Just don't maintain that you don't know this woman. - I'm starting to. - What's her name? How do you get in touch with her? - She does the getting in touch. I'm starting to wonder if I'd miss her if she didn't. - What does she want with you? - She wants to recruit me into her gang. She wants me to be her assistant, her accomplice. - And you're encouraging this? - No. Actually I just realized that that's what she does want. Sometimes you have to say things to know they're true. Good luck. - I don't want an accomplice, I work alone. - If I know you, I'm your accomplice. - Not legally. - Yes, legally. Look. It's me they're following. - Come on. - You'd be a lot safer without me. - Security doesn't interest me as much as it does you. - I'm not a coward. - I know, I know. I actually know that. (upbeat kooky music) Come on! - Hey! - Come on! - This is not my city. If it were my city, I'd have the little dodger by now. - Is this the way you want to live? - It's like poetry. You seize it with uncertain, daring. That's the way it's always been. - I happen to like men. - This is such hard work. She likes men now. - Women sometimes do. - Her mind is made of magazine articles. - We can't all be towering intellectuals. - You know, I feel a real bond with you for that. - I'm so glad. It's a privilege to be treating Zorro. - She protected me from the police. - I imagine she feels responsible for her own attractiveness. She may feel she's getting you into trouble. - She's right. - In your place I wouldn't think that. I will take responsibility for what I do. - Please. I don't pay you all this money to talk to me in cliches. - You must think your own thoughts, the ones that fit into your mind. - You're such a moralist. - I believe in morality. - I believe in a good haircut. - You believe in striking attitudes. - All right, you're right. But morality isn't what you do. It's how you feel about what you do. - That's very convenient. - It's the least we can do for ourselves. She saved me today. I'm waiting till she realizes how she feels about that. (kooky music) (Wesley screaming) (thudding) - Oh, fuck! I think I'm paralyzed. - Who should we call? - [Wesley] There's a number in my pocket. Captain Rita. (Wesley groaning) - Which pocket? - Call it, call it! - Nice try. - You are under arrest! - I know. Wave the pigeons away when they land. If they shit on you, no one will be able to find you. Are you gonna be okay here all alone? Let's go. (clanging) (pigeons cooing) - You will not be able to do it for a while. Will you? (light accordion music) - Do you know what love is? - Yes. - Do you really know what love is? - Nah. - (laughing) Good. Then tell me about it. I hate to listen to people who know things. (singing in foreign language) (gentle piano music) (cuffs clacking) - This is not a sexual act. You are going to jail for a long time. (laughing) (audience clapping) - Bravo! - Bravissima! - Encore! - Encore! (groaning) - Ah. Bravo. (grunting) Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah. Bravo. Bravo. (chill jazz music) (crickets chirping) (chimes ringing) (splashing) (girls giggling) - With this ring, I thee wed. - No! I don't want to marry you! I don't want to marry anybody. - Well that won't be easy to take off. (light piano music) - Where's the bathroom? - I think it's that way. I'd like to finish an evening with her sometime. - If she wanted it that way, it would happen. - It's like Valéry said. Do you know Valéry? "The beautiful is that which fills us with despair." (light piano music) - I tell you what. Let's go up there and have lunch. Come on, it'll be fun! Come on! We can do this for the rest of our lives! (sighing) Nice place to commit suicide. No, no, I didn't mean you. - I want to! (tense music) - She was such a good student. Miranda. I thought very carefully about what I'm going to say to you. And I'm convinced it's the best thing for both of us. Miranda. Will you marry me? - Marry you? - It's my dream! And I want it to be your dream. Don't answer now. Just think about it. Apart from making me the happiest man in the world, it would work for us. - (mumbling) Mmm, no, no, no! It's all right, I don't even want the the money back, don't worry about it. I've got lots of it. Of course, if you still have the cards, without pin numbers, they are not much use. - You wrote down the pin numbers on the piece of paper in your wallet. - Ah, so you cleaned out my accounts on the ATM, hmm. - Only up to the daily limit. I went back a few times and then I'm afraid I threw them all out. - So sadistic. I do like you. Forgive me for addressing you like a lady of the evening but did I buy some time with you? - Why is it only the vulgar are rich? - I could nurture your talent, get you engagements, coach your career! We'd be a great team! - Let's see what they have here. I will order everything! Not that I will eat it. Are you happy here? - Happy? - Are you satisfied picking pockets in this ruined country? Don't you want to come away with me? - Where would you take me to? - To a whole other life. There is no use trying to describe it. I can give you absolutely anything you want. - Ah, you're the devil! - Ah, at last. You've uncovered the true me. Will you think about it? - [Becky] I guess I'll have to. - What's wrong? Would you please not stare at my friend? - She wants me to stare at her. And if you look under the table you would see that her legs are crossed towards me. Women love the devil. - Fritz. - My darling. - Is he flirting with you? - He winked at me. - Did you wink at her? - All right, so what? I wank at her. - You wanked at her? - Wank, you idiot. Past tense of wink. - Nice company. - It's better than nothing. - Miranda! - It's not easy to keep her in one place. But I think I've just succeeded. (light piano music) - I want to marry a woman. - Do you have any particular woman in mind? - Yes. - And you want me to marry you? - I don't know. I didn't think about that. - You came to me to talk about it. - Yes. - In a case like this, I speak for the church. I don't think the church is there yet. I don't know if I'm there yet. I don't know if we'll ever be. Why do you want to marry a woman? I don't mean why are you attracted to her. I can understand that. I mean, why get married? - Yes, there are different kinds of marriage. I meant I want to live with a woman. - Then I've lost you. - As a priest, maybe. But as a father? - Bring me a father problem and I'll see what I can do. What happened to your faith? You know, it's just possible that God is as vulnerable as we are. - What's he doing? Bribing you with heaven or blackmailing you with hell? - Excommunicating me. (light piano music) (splashing) (women giggling) - Do you want children? - Not yet. - Do you want a dog? - Not really. - Do you want a cat? - I'm allergic. - What about a bird? Do you want a bird? - It's too depressing to see them in cages. - They don't know they're in cages. - I don't want one. - I love you. - I know. - Do you love me? - Sure. (both laughing) - All on your takings as a pickpocket? - I want to live like a gentleman. I go to work all day and she stays home and makes dinner and thinks about me. - [Psychiatrist] So it's perfect? - No, she still has her own place. She won't tell me where it is. She won't tell her mother where it is. She's still not a hundred percent there. - [Psychiatrist] Clever girl. - Yeah. Faster than me, which is saying something. I've never met anyone before who was faster than me. Except you, of course, Doctor. - And what does she think about your profession? - I don't know. I don't know if she knows. - [Psychiatrist] One issue at a time. Cohabiting with a woman may be enough on her plate. - Don't you ever have a happy thought? - [Psychiatrist] I want you to be happy. - Well, try a little harder. I'm aware, Doctor, that paradise is a fragile and fleeting state. So is she. We're both treating it with all possible tact. We're in midair where we belong. - Hello! - Yoohoo! What a surprise! - Come and have dinner! How did you find this place? - I've known it for a while. - You live better than I do. - I make more money than you do. - What do you do? - I move funds. - It's hard to understand. - [Katerina] You're in business? - No. She's a snob about business. - It's more of an intellectual thing. I mean, I like to think so. - [Katerina] Well I hope you're paying your own way. - Oh yeah, she's very independent. - That's why we're friends. - Are you meeting any boys? - We go out looking for them, but - We're keeping our eyes open. - Well I'm sure they're looking for you. - Oh yeah. - They're not all, - They only want one thing. - We're choosy. - I'm glad to hear it. (train whooshing) (train chugging) - [Wesley] Ha! - You got me. I surrender. - [Wesley] I don't see that you have much choice. - To tell you the truth, I've been looking forward to this moment. The first time I saw you and touched you stayed in my memory. Something in me just wants to surrender to you. It'll be worth giving up my freedom and sacrificing my career just to have you handcuff me. I wanna be your prisoner. I'm afraid this is my stop. - Hey! (people laughing) Hey, stop her! She's getting away! Oh, fuck. She's a thief, I'm the policeman, stop her! - This is Rita. - This is Wesley Stankovich. I am handcuffed to a metro car and I don't have any keys. - You're what? (kooky music) - [Wesley] I'm here, I'm here! (growling) - Wesley? Don't worry. I'm here. Where was that? Oh, I forgot the keys. But it's okay. I will call someone. Ne? Yes, ne, ne, I mean yes. (speaks in foreign language) Over. Okay, they are coming to meet us. Wesley? I'm glad we have this minute alone together here. There's something important I have to tell you. - What? - I'm pregnant! - What? - [Gina] I'm pregnant. - Can't you take a pill or something? (light guitar music) - Why don't you have me now? - I don't want you now. - Well when will you want me? - We'll see. - Perhaps you'll never want me again. - Could be. - I was so happy. - Oh, I'll probably get bored and want you. (suspenseful jazz music) (elevator dinging) - What the hell did you get broccoli for? I hate broccoli. - It's all they had that was fresh. - Broccoli? Fuck. - Stop whining. (Wesley screaming in distance) - I know that scream. (body thudding) - Ugh! - Shit. Fuck! Let's get out of here and let someone else find him. - No! They'll say you did it. - Why would they say that? - This is a policeman! They'll talk to everybody. They'll talk to us. Watch where you work. There won't be any doubt in their minds that you killed him. - What do we do? - Move the body. - Where? He's huge! - He can't stay here! When morning comes, everyone's going to see him! - Shit. (phone ringing) - Becky? - I've got something here I need help with. Can you come over? - Sure. - [Katerina] What? (guitar strumming) - Who is he? - A policeman. - How did he die? - He was trying to get into our place to arrest me when he fell. - You're living together? - Did you kill him? - No! - But they'll think she killed him. - I'm a thief. And a lesbian. And that's a dead cop. - You're living with a dyke?! - Please don't shout. If anyone hears us, it's all over! - You're living with a goddamn homosexual? Are you a homosexual?! - Is she gonna be a problem? - Yes. - [Katerina] Are you listening to me?! - No! But unfortunately, I can hear you. And so can everyone else! - What do you propose? - To move the body, make it look like a suicide. Quickly, before they wake up. - Where would somebody commit suicide? - On Lycabettus. I did it myself once. - He's large. It would take four men to get him up there. Men! (phone ringing) - Miranda? - Are you a priest today or a father? - Which one do you need? - Gerhard, for God's sake, answer your phone! (phone buzzing) - Ah, Becky. Will you ever be more than a buzz in my pants? - Gerhard, I need you to be a man. - At last. When will I have the pleasure of making you submit? - Professor Audley? - And this fellow is dead, I take it? Hmm, and how did he die? - It was an accident, but the police won't think so. We're going to move him. - Move him, where? - The top of Lycabettus. (owl hooting) - It's a long way. Just the what, five, four of us? - God has inhaled again, it seems. - This is my piano professor. - Hello. - Oh, hello. You're going to help with the, - It will be a sort of funeral. He will have two of them. One here, and one in London. - What, he's British? - My car is outside. We can get halfway up the mountain with it. Katerina, my child. Don't be so gloomy. Everything's going to be fine. - No, I'm not going to help a fucking dyke who seduced my daughter! - You're a lesbian? - If you can get her to declare herself about anything, let me know. - He has been extensively damaged. I hope you enjoyed yourself. You are one-upping the devil. I am not sure I approve. - So, will you help us? - Oh, very well. I refuse to be outdone. Who takes what? He is rather heavy. Can I have my chauffeur do it? (men grunting) Your buttocks are extremely agreeable. I can't wait to take the whip to them. - That's my father. - Ah, how do you do? He's younger than I am. I should be ashamed of myself. - [Becky] Don't worry. - An understanding father. I like him already. Were you born looking English? Where's your own little thing? - Out front, I'm afraid, with the corpse. - Can't be much fun. - No, its fine. He's not hard yet. - I am. - I didn't mean that. (owl hooting) (men grunting) (owl hooting) - All right! All right, all right, all right! All right! God dammit! Well, come on! Let's do it! Let's do it! (everyone grunting) Lesbian! Who goes on top when you do it? - It's better than nothing. - You like to say that. We should never belittle nothing. Nothing has its satisfactions. (solemn chanting music) (praying in foreign language) (bell tolling in distance) (rocks rustling) (body thudding) - "I go to seek a great perhaps." Rabelais. Do you know Rabelais? - "But blind to former, as to future fate, what mortal knows his preexistent state?" Poe. But what does it mean, really? - Life for an Englishman? Hot water bottles, I gues. - Death, I meant. - We all go through it. - We don't know the value of death. But to be in love, is surely the greatest of pleasures. - I have to agree with the priest. Are you ready to surrender to me or shall I turn you in? (clacking) - Miranda, you know how I feel about you. - No. I'd have to feel the same way to know how you feel. - Come on, Englishman. Let's see if you've got one single interesting thing to say. That was fun, huh? I haven't got rid of a body in a long time. See you in church. - So? What do you wanna do? - I don't know. - You wanna go watch a movie? - I don't know. - You wanna grab something to eat? - I'm not hungry. - You wanna go for a walk? - I don't see how else we're going to get home. What are you smiling at? - Home. (kooky music) (speaks in foreign language) - What happened? (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) Traffic duty. (light music) - I had a good day. - Steal lots of wallets? Steal Miranda's heart? - I'm still chasing her. She's like Mrs. Darling. - Who? - Didn't you ever read Peter Pan? Wendy's mother had a kiss at the corner of her mouth that Mr. Darling could never quite get. - You found something you can't steal. - I live with a sense of promise. Did you say you know Valéry? "Nothing is more delicious than a promise." - There's a savor of reality in that. You're progressing. - You give me courage, I'll steal it yet. - More progress. Better to steal hearts than money. - Yes, my treatment's over. Doctor, are you listening? - [Psychiatrist] I'm just getting some tissues. - You've cured me. It's time to stand on my own two feet. I feel better now.
