Hi. Come on in. Come in. My name is Werner Herzog. I'm a director. I've directed and written and produced some 40 or maybe 50 films. Well, we do have yucca, very Peruvian-- or, actually, in all Amazonia you have those roots. You cook them, but it really has to be perfect, because they are-- they're a little bit boring, and... you don't overcook them. Lena, do we have a pot? I mean, a real large one for the yucca? If it's not so large, I could actually cut it. - Yeah, you have to cut them. - In half, yeah. You have to cut them at least in half. - Yeah, okay. - And then there's another pot over there. It doesn't need much, it just needs some salt. The only thing is, you have to cook it the right amount. Um, it's slightly toxic and you, uh, can taste it. It has a slightly bitter taste. [Telephone ringing] If you cook it the right amount, you know, it's not toxic anymore. Who is it? Lena: It's-- it's Laurie from Ricky Jay's office. Okay, I'm coming. Hello, Laurie. Hello. Oh, that's great. Very good, very good. So he's coming. We're gonna be 14. Children, Lotte Eisner here, my mentor. The guys here in the early phase of "Aguirre." And that is actually from "Fitzcarraldo." [Clears throat] They're very serious arrows. So they're huge. And that is actually still some poison in it. It's-- it's not-- not a very dangerous-- it's not like curare. It's actually an anticoagulant. So when you are hit, you do not stop bleeding easily. So... And I should show you the diaries I wrote at that time. It's very, very strange, because I really, really subminiaturized it. Yes, I do have a reputation of being a filmmaker getting himself into dangerous situations and into adventures and into trouble. I believe that this kind of labeling started because I've done "adventurous," quote unquote, films. Among them "Aguirre, the Wrath of God." Wild story about Spanish conquistadors in search of El Dorado. [Speaking German] "Fitzcarraldo." A man who tries to pull a boat over a mountain. And we actually pulled a huge steamship over a real mountain. "My Best Fiend." [Speaking German] Which is a crazy relationship between Klaus Kinski and me. Very productive, though, but we plotted to murder each other at the same time. And I also did a film, "La Soufri√®re," which was shot on a volcano that was just about to explode. That is my reputation, but it was never my intention to get into any trouble or run excessive risks. John: Werner, I notice these pictures on the wall of Loch Ness. Herzog: Yeah, it's my next project, a documentary. It's gonna be called "The Enigma of Loch Ness," and, of course, here are some of the famous photos of Nessie the monster. And of course you can tell that it's made up here. This in particular. I'll show it to you. Look, watch the water. The water is... cannot be miniaturized. The movement of water. See, it's probably only toy size, and that's very funny. So it shows very clearly that this whole thing about Loch Ness is more or less a figment of our fantasy, and I like that much more than the real monster. So what's going on in our collective dreams and collective nightmares. I keep asking myself why is it that so many Americans were abducted by aliens? Not only met aliens, but they abducted them. And when you take a close look, the vast majority of them are severely overweight women. And they were not only abducted, but also gang-raped by aliens, and I keep myself asking that question. Why? Why have we never seen any women being abducted from Ethiopia? Or why have we never seen anyone being abducted from Bangladesh or Nigeria? So that is probably the focus of what I'm gonna do. I've always been interested in the difference between fact and truth. And I've always sensed that there's something like a deeper truth. It exists in cinema, and I would call it the ecstatic truth. It is somehow the same thing like in poetry. When you read a great poem, you instantly would know in your-- in your heart, in your guts that there's a deep, inherent truth, an ecstatic truth. So there's an ecstasy in those who have been abducted and it has to do with our collective desires, our collective dreams, and it's a very strange crossover. I can't figure out yet, but I'm trying to find the real wackos out there. Werner, Zak is here. Come on in. - Hello. - Hi, Lena. Werner: Hello, Zak. You brought Sophie. Yes, we did. We did. What's with the camera crew, huh? Werner: Hello, hello, hello. What's with the camera crew? Lena: I think Werner should explain. - Zak: Okay. Hi. - Lena: Hello. Hi, Michelle. Sophie. Mwah. - Hello. - Can you say hello? - Zak: Can I just put this over here? - Do you remember her? Oh, yeah, please. Put it here. Just-- is this gonna be filming all the time? It's a little film they are doing. Don't worry about them. I got you some scotch in honor of the movie. - Ah, a serious one. - Yeah, it's a good one. - 18 years. - Yeah, it's 18 years. My name is Zak Penn. I'm a-- I'm a screenwriter mostly. I have written on a lot of films. Uh, I wrote "Last Action Hero." I wrote a script called "Suspect Zero." I wrote "X-Men 2." I've been a production rewriter. I've been a producer. I've done a lot of different things in Hollywood, and I was the producer of "Enigma of Loch Ness." Werner: We really have to talk about a few things. Okay, that's fine. Because we only have so much-- so much, uh, to do. Right. No, no, I know. It's, you know, it's very, very little time. Right, but what about the-- is this crew gonna film us the whole time we're talking? Is it okay? We should switch it off here. Let's-- let's take the microphone off. Yeah, I just-- you know, not the-- not to be paranoid or whatever. I've been up there once, and you can roll gigantic boulders all the way down to the ocean, and it's-- there's a feeling of Sisyphus, and so it's... Okay. Fine. That's a typically Herzogian moment. I'm happy to... Yeah, well, I don't even know whether it's gonna end up in the film. Okay. There's one thing that definitely is gonna end up in the film. I need a truly obsessed cryptozoologist. Okay. But one, I mean, as obsessed as he is, he shouldn't look like-- like a wacko. He should be credible. Okay, so obsessed but credible. - Yes. - Okay. You probably have some connections down in Inverness already. I do. Okay. Some strange people over there. Yeah, no, there's a lot of obsessed. I don't know about credible, but I'll look into it. Um. Okay. Cool. - Let's get a drink. Come on. - Okay. Good, good. - Hi. - Hello. Lena: Hello. Come on in. Missy: Thank you. - This is my wife Lena. - Hello. - Nice to see you. - Hi, I'm Missy. Hello. Hi. Hi. [Laughs] So this is a-- it's a-- it's a film crew. I know John Bailey. How are you, John Bailey? - Man: John, one second, please. - Yeah, I'm in. Same eye level. - It just came out. - What's this movie? I'm after-- I'm after what-- what constitutes fact and what constitutes truth. You show me the difference. Can you do that? Of course not. Mention any card at all. Did you see the way he took that out of his pocket? Very tricky. - Mention any card? - Yeah. Um... ace of spades. - [Laughs] - Um, you could. What you mentioned was the ace of spades. And you're behind me and on all sides of me. And over me. But that still should work. [All laugh] - Oh! - Wow. Hello, hello, hello? - Hello. - Ah... - How are you? - You must be the Mexican. - Gabby Beristain, yes. - Ah, nice to meet you. - Yes, finally. - Very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Yes. Finally. So you probably know how to handle yucca. - Of course! - I'm a little bit lost. Yes. Elisabeth, my wife. - Can I say Gabriel? - Absolutely. Hi. How are you? Sounds a little bit more serious. Gabby, how are you? Looking dapper as always. Yes, thank you very much. I'm a member of the American Society of Cinematographers and the British Society of Cinematographers. I have done films like "Blade II," uh, "S.W.A.T." recently. Films like "K2," "Caravaggio" in the past. I have done about 25 films-- feature films so far. Do you like my "Fitzcarraldo" look, sir? [Speaks Spanish] La elegancia. La elegancia. That film changed my life, I must say. It's fantastic. - Which one? - "Fitzcarraldo." - Let's not talk about movies. - No, we won't. We won't. I was hired to do "The Enigma of Loch Ness" by an invitation from Zak Penn. One day he called me and said, "Look, I'm doing a film with Werner Herzog." Obviously, the opportunity to work with Werner Herzog is unique. Films like "Fitzcarraldo," "Aguirre" shaped our understanding not only of filmmaking, but also life. A cinematographer must-- must not be a coward. Absolutely. You have to be physical, you have to have courage. Yeah, yeah. - Keep the other eye always open. - Sure. Gabriel Beristain is a director of photography who works on very, very commercial movies. Big, big Hollywood movies. And I thought this would be a fantastic opportunity for Werner to work with someone like this. It might bring a whole new audience to his films. - Okay. Cheers. - Well, you have saved directors. [Both laugh] Cheers. [Overlapping chatter] Uh, Gabriel... Where do you want me to sit? Right there. [Jazz music playing] [clinks glasses] Very good to have you here. Cheers. Prost. No, that's-- it's fun to believe in things, but Carl Sagan in his book says just because it's fun to believe in things doesn't mean that we should believe in them. No, it's not fun. I think there's-- no, no, no, no, no. Zak: But it's possible there's something there. I mean, isn't it possible? No, Zak. It's-- and, Jeff. It's not just fun. It's a deep necessity of this civilization. There's something not gone right with our civilization. And somehow we need the very dark monsters. - Mm. - Come on, you are the expert. Now... "The Exterminating Angel." I've got to admit to my defeat. I have to admit to a defeat. I wanted to serve you yucca. But I think it's not well-- right done. It still has a kind of taste that is not completely correct. You-- you would know. - Yeah. - Gabriel? Do you want me to put it here? But be careful, though. If it's not completely well-done... - Oh, yeah. - It's still kind of toxic. - You want me to try? - [Laughter] Toxic. Oh. [Overlapping chatter] Can can you just a moment? Just one moment with him, yeah. A friend of mine made it and it's a ritual for the new ones. - Ah, well, salud. - Salud. Look, I do have some concerns, - and I really needed to talk to you about it. - Yeah, what is it? Well, I mean, mainly my lighting package. My lighting package is tiny. What do you mean by "lighting package"? Because we don't need any. It's a documentary. Well, there is some lighting. I mean, I told Gabby there would be some lighting. But I don't think we need to-- I mean, this-- But that makes it much more clumsy, and... Well, I do need Werner to tell me all about the recreations, what he wants to do and which light-- What-- was it, recreations? - It's dessert time. Come on, let's go. - Okay. Is it reenactments? What is on your mind? You know what? Let me sort this out. You go have dessert, and I'll talk to Gabby about it. This is-- it's not a good time, because-- Yeah, we need to clarify that. - I mean, I don't know-- - No, no, no. We will. He knows. We've talked about this many times. He's just-- he's had a couple of drinks. It's a social setting. Let's go back to the party. Let's go back to the-- I swear to you, Gabby, we're gonna settle this, all right? Zak, we need to talk about this. This is serious, man. Or course we do. Of course, of course. Come on. That's the trouble with those, I... do not have the right razor blades. I've got a lot of those, but... let's see. Just don't click in. John, you shouldn't shoot such a banality. Uh, rather, filmmaking is a chain of banalities. [Music playing] John: Lot of different kinds there. No, that's-- that's the problem. Yeah, which one I buy. I better buy those, though, because it has both of it. Plus that is safe. John: So, Werner, how did-- how did it come that Zak ended up producing this film? Don't you normally produce your own movies? Normally I produce my own films, but that was always a necessity. But here there was a case where, all of a sudden, the money was there and I didn't have to-- to go through all this hassle. And most important was that Zak was so enthusiastic, and that was kind of convincing. I think it's gonna work out. Okay. Hey, wait, wait. Where are you going? Forgot. Okay, okay, okay, okay. [Sighs] John: What are you guys doing? Oh, that's an old Russian superstition. It's not a superstition. Come on. It's very Russian. No, it's not a superstition. It's Russian, but it's not a super-- you have to sit down before you go for a journey. If you don't, you get screwed up. - We'd better move. Come on. - Okay. [Speaks German] Maybe call you tomorrow. Thank you. - Thanks a lot. - Thank you, folks. Uh, just out here. Um... Nessie's one of the least interesting things about this area. I mean, if you look at-- coming into Inverness now, this whole area, ten years ago, it was a big farm. And now it's just another flipping franchise complex. Another chapter in globalization in Scotland. You can bring to light so many of the problems in this area. And so many of the-- the issues. Well, I'm not here for that. That's TV stuff. Robert O'Meara, yes, he got a little bit on my nerves. I didn't dislike him. His heart was in the right place. And he was a good kid. I want to see the background, Highland games, maybe people who... - Highland games, yeah? - ...who make whiskey. And some real urchin in a cellar. And, um... Some-- right, okay. Okay, great. Great. A guy-- a shepherd with his flock. Anything. Anything. - You see, we need to-- - Shepherd... Don't write it down. We just need to stay open to anything. I just say "shepherd" because-- I don't mean it literally. Let anything come, and we'll do it. Ah, okay. Metaphor. Great. Um... Yes. Show you your quarters. Looks nice. Where's the production office? It's just down the corridor here, but I thought you'd be-- you're obviously quite jet-lagged. I mean-- No, no, come on. Who is there? Are they all there? Yeah, probably. Um... Right. It's room number 10. Yeah, let's see the-- - Thank you, May. - Thank you. I'd like to see the office. - Yeah, absolutely. - Okay, let's go. Hello, folks. Werner Herzog has arrived. Oh, my God. Werner, how are you? Zak: I am an enormous fan of Werner's, but am I after credibility? Sure. I had dreams of winning an award for working on a movie with Werner Herzog. This is all the proof we need. Yeah, I know. It's great, isn't it? It's, like, uh, all the Nessie stuff. Hey, let's go get a drink. What do you say? Should we do some work? Come on. It's late. I've been here all day. Let's have a drink, at least, to celebrate. Do they have a stout? - I'm sure they have a stout. - Yeah, okay. - This is Scotland. - Out there? In the hall? Oh, hey, John. Uh, did you guys come with Werner? John: No, we took an earlier flight. Oh, how long are you staying? John: As long as Werner's here. They were at the airport. - I was kind of surprised. - Oh, great. - In heavy rain. - Yeah, it's good to see you. Well, welcome. Welcome. Hey, Matt. - How are you? - Let's have a stout. - What's up, Zak? - Great. Attention. Attention, please. Um, welcome. If we could all please give our names and roles, we'll go around the table quickly. Uh, my name is Zak Penn. I'm the producer. I've been introduced. Werner Herzog. Russell Williams, sound mixer. Russell: Well, I worked in the Los Angeles film industry for 23 years. I'm a two-time Academy Award winner, two-time Emmy winner for sound. I worked on "Field of Dreams," "Glory," and "Dances With Wolves." Worked on a couple with Eddie Murphy. "Boomerang" and "Distinguished Gentleman." That's actually where I worked with our cinematographer, Gabriel. Gabriel Beristain, cinematographer, DP, camera man. Uh, David Davidson. I'm the captain. - Werner: We haven't met. - No. How do you do, Mr. Herzog? I was hired as the marine coordinator for the film. And then I was asked if I could actually be the captain of the ship. I actually had to drive the boat as well as coordinating everything else that was going on round about. So you've got five days on the boat later on this week. Five days? That's-- that sounds very much-- I mean, I don't need five days. Russell: I agree. That's excessive, isn't it? Gabriel: Well, I don't think it's that excessive. Werner: Gabriel. Gabriel. I don't need five days. It's just a waste of time. - Zak: But, Werner. Werner. - Yeah? Can I just interrupt for a second? Um, there's actually some pretty good reasons. Could you-- could you get the stuff? David: I mean, I can do my boat in a day. Right. I'm aware of that. Thanks, David. But, there's actually reasons that have-- that are more important that have to do with what kind of promises we've made in terms of the film that we're gonna deliver. We have to have a credible expedition. Part of the reason-- take a look at these. Part of the reason why I have taken such lengths to make everything look so official is because I want to show people that we're actually doing a real expedition. - So... - Werner: What's that for? I mean, what's it for? This is-- you mean, what's-- it's, like, an official expedition jumpsuit. What do you mean what is it for? - Yeah, I-- - I mean, what-- There's nothing official. We're shooting a film. - Well, it's for safety. - We're just shooting. What safety. What do you mean by safety? I mean, if you fall in the water, this way we know you're one of our team. I mean, this is-- that's the point. Come on, Russell. I want to go to work. Let's shoot this Adrian Shine guy. - Let's go out. - Russell: Right now? Adrian Shine, yeah. Zak: Are we on the boat, or are we-- Werner: Let's just go to work. Robert: Werner, do you want a car? You want to drive? B.J., could you bring the van around, please? Oh, yeah. Go-- go down there. Just go upstairs. Attaching a motor... [continues quietly] Okay, but how does it operate? It's totally remote-controlled from the boat. So you're gonna be on the boat? Oh, no, definitely not. I'm not planning on going on the boat. I can't-- I can't swim. You can't swim? Really? Okay, well, build it. John: Let's go. Okay, so which way do you think we'll start? Like, basically-- Okay, well, that way, I'll keep my mics pointed away from the traffic, and that reduces as much as I can. I would like to have the camera on that side. The camera will be right next to you. We'll be like this. That was a productive day. We started out with Adrian Shine who is a naturalist who lives right by the shore of the lake. And I truly liked his beard. He, among all the wackos that you find out there, seemed to be the only voice of reason. Undoubtedly, the Loch Ness monster exists as myth. And as an amalgam of myth. With the coming of Christianity, many of these other beliefs, of course, assumed a diabolical status. And then we shot with a man, Steve Feltham, who lives right down by the lake for 12 years by now, and, uh... Could just see that. Werner: And we got some very nice landscapes. So the more you-- more time you spend here, the less monsters you will see, because the more things you will understand. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Wait with that, please. What was interesting is how confused they were, because you were actually shooting digital video from a different perspective and I was straight at them with my celluloid camera. With your crew, I'm not sure whether we've started or not. No, no, well, they-- they are-- they are always around somehow. It was just a surveillance camera in a shopping mall. Two boys taking a toddler away, and they actually murdered him. Werner, this is Professor Michael Karnow. - He is our cryptozoologist. - Hello. - A pleasure to meet you. - This is Gabby Beristain, cinematographer. We finally are teamed up on an expedition. I'm looking forward to it. I want to let you know that you should feel free to use me as a resource. For data, information, anything having to do with the cryptozoological topics. - He's there for you. - Yep. Oh, you know, I have something for you, actually. Uh, a photograph. Werner wanted a cryptozoologist, which-- a cryptozoologist is a person who studies undiscovered animals, I guess is the best way to put it. The people who go out and look for the abominable snowman or Nessie or any of these creatures. - The jungle pig. - What is it called? Uh, I know you spent a lot of time in the Amazon basin, and that's where this was photographed. A thousand miles from its native habitat. But where is it? I can't figure it out. Right here. The snout, the appendages, fore and aft, got these haunches. I was going to-- I want to give you this, actually. - This is a gift for you. - Oh, that's very kind of you, yeah. - "To Werner"? - That's okay, yes. To Werner. I actually like your beard. - You will be great on film. - Well, thank you. All the naturalists here have wonderful beards. - "Best wishes." - Thank you. That's for you. That's a gift. - That's very kind. - Let's go eat some breakfast. What is that? Oh, this is a long story. Okay, did I do what you wanted there? Yeah, you're fine. You were yourself. - Okay, guys, have a good day. - I still can't-- Where is the-- gonna keep it anyway. It's supposed to be somewhere there. [Motor chugging] [motor stops] - It's not gonna work. - What's not gonna work? The engine on this boat is way too loud. So we can't get any usable dialogue on this boat if the engine is running. Well, what's the solution to that? I don't know if you have this in the budget, but on "Drop Zone" we actually used a tow vessel about 500 yards beyond the bow, and we pulled the picture boat along, and that way this boat would be totally quiet. That's the only thing I can suggest. No, I mean, that's just absolutely ridiculous. You know, I'm-- no, we can't do that. Two weeks ago, you guys showed me some boat, right? That was-- it was a smaller boat, but I remember when we walked on, you said, "This boat has a whisper-quiet engine." That was a much smaller boat, you know, with a smaller engine. No, no, I under-- hear me out. No, I know. Hear me out. Hear me out. What I'm saying is take the engine from that boat and put it in this boat. Take out this engine, put in that engine, or wherever it goes. - I mean, again, that's totally ridiculous. - Why is that ridiculous? That's like putting a mini engine in a Rolls-Royce. I mean, and safety-- You know what? No, wait. Wait. It's fine. Okay. This boat was thoroughly approved by everybody on production in LA. - Except me. - Here's the thing. If you won't do it, it's fine. We'll get somebody else who will do it. Find a different captain, find somebody who will put the engine in for me. I understand. I respect that. I respect he doesn't want to do it. So if he doesn't want to do it, he doesn't have to do it. We'll find somebody else who will. Or do you want to do it? I'll do it. Okay, good. So then that's what we'll do. We'll take that engine, we'll put it in this boat, we'll get some good sounds, we'll all go home, we won't go too fast. It'll be fine, okay? - Russell: Problem solved. - Okay? Let's go. John: So, Robert, let me ask you a question. Uh, how's production going so far? Uh, not bad, not bad. We've had a few interesting days now that Mr. Herzog's here. I know that they went down to the shore and they got that nut who lives in that van. And I heard that was pretty funny, too. So good. Think it's going well. I would say it's going very well because-- well, I do not see any dailies, but from my gut feeling, that's always to what it boils down, I can say. It's been very good. There was real life in shooting. Werner knows exactly what he was looking for and today he was just showing-- I mean, everyone there was absolutely fascinated by his questions. The crew is good. I really do have a good rapport with Gabriel. And with the sound man, Russell. He's very professional and it's good fun to have him around. This is like a dream come true for me, John. I mean, it's a very beautiful location and, in general, up here in the Highlands, it's very quiet. There's not a lot of vehicular traffic. There's a couple of random people on crew who-- they were kind of brought in mainly by Zak, really. Um, the most obscure of which would have to be Karnow the cryptozoologist. What I'm doing here is I'm doing laundry. As you can see, I'm separating them. Whites from darks. But I don't use detergent, because that degrades the fiber, and after a hundred or so washes, what you'll begin to see is your apparel beginning to literally fall apart. But if you just hang it up like this and you let some air come through, the dirt, it falls out. Who just seems to be a little... I don't want to use the word "eccentric," 'cause I don't think it quite fits him. This is from the famous Lodge-Kinney expedition in British Columbia, 1978. This was sent to a laboratory, and the findings were that it does not match with any known genetic sequence. Okay? So whether this is Bigfoot or Sasquatch or the wild man of the mountain, there's no confirmation one way or the other. Here we have a tentacle. This was captured by a team of fishermen off of... - John: Hold it still. Let me take a look at it. - ...Sri Lanka. - Tentacle of what? - Uh, I don't know exactly. Again, it could be a squid that if it grew to its full length... would... be perhaps 100 feet. John: So tomorrow's the first day on the boat. Are you excited? Looking forward, absolutely. I think really, really, really very excited about it. Most of my previous work in this region has been land-based, okay? To get out on the water, I think it's gonna give me a whole new perspective on finding this thing and gathering data. I think our chances by being out there, increase exponentially. And I've seen the boat. It looks clumsy, but it's very-- it looks reliable. Clumsy. Has a very nice, deep, resonant sound. Not too loud. I'm really impressed that our producer actually took the time to refit an engine in the boat because there was gonna be a sound problem. Now, I've done sound in Hollywood for 23 years, and I can tell you that very rarely happens. The thing that people are gonna pay to see is not Werner throwing some rocks down a hill. It's gonna be Werner Herzog on the prow of that boat, or whatever it is-- the mast-- the thing at the front. Standing there, hunting the goddamn Loch Ness monster. Show me one piece of evidence that proves this thing does not exist, okay? They don't have-- I mean, you know, they're saying, "Show us the evidence." I'm saying, "Show us the non-evidence." Give us one piece. You know? Where are the books written about the non-evidence? I think Zak Penn and I are now, at this stage, speaking separate languages. There's so many misunderstandings, there's so many different communications. One of the reasons why I've shifted into producing is because, you know, I'm sick of being in the background. I'm sick of not having any say, of being pushed around. You know, one of the things I like about being a producer is, you know, you don't take as much shit from people. You say, "Here's what I want." You know? "Fire that writer." Perhaps the only thing that I'm a bit concerned is with the famous-- the recreations. Yeah, I think the recreations are a bit strange. I'm still not sure exactly what we are gonna be doing with that. But Werner knows exactly what he's doing, and I think it's gonna be great. Yeah. All right, that's the case that's got the Nagra in it right there, Werner. So that's all backup. [Indistinct chatter] - I'm David. I'm the captain. - I'm Steve, camera assistant. - Cables. - Thanks. You want to put your camera up here in the port side? I'm gonna be running cable port, starboard, stern, bow. David: Yeah, so what are you? What do you do? - Hmm? - What do you do? Cryptozoologist. Scientific advisor. The guy came on board the boat, you know. Didn't really seem to know what he was talking about. You know, brought all these strange electronic objects out. - This is a, uh-- an advanced scanner. - [Beeping] And I can't wait to get this puppy out there. I got this right here, which should come in handy. I can-- well, that gives you a sense for how it extends. And then you can do it double. It's got this nub at the end. As long as you keep me informed of everything you're doing on board the boat, you know, before you go and do it. You got it. This is about three feet, but it may extend to nine. - Really? - Okay? And we're gonna be running it probably port-starboard direction. - Yeah, that sounds really interesting. - All right. Okay. [Device beeps] These are gonna be here, and I don't need people touching them, okay? Hey. I'm Kitana Baker. - Who are you? - Kitana Baker. Gabriel: The first day on the boat was very, very interesting to say the least. We were boarding the boat when suddenly, from nowhere, the most absolutely beautiful creature came in with us. She had the boiler suit. She was absolutely beautiful. Her name is Kitana. Her tag name was "sonar operator," but obviously Werner was as puzzled and as surprised as every one of us. Where's Zak? I hadn't been told anything about this woman working aboard the ship. So all of a sudden she walks up to me and she has this jumpsuit on and it says "sonar operator." And she didn't look like a sonar operator. Can the boat go any faster? No. What's our course today? Where are we heading? We're steering 0-6-0. Cable! I don't know what he's doing. It's going-- I think it's going really well. I think it's, uh, you know-- a few disappointments. I'm a little bit disappointed Werner didn't wear the jumpsuit. I would have liked to have seen that. I think it would help with the expedition. The jumpsuit. Oh, my God, yeah. I never had any intention to wear that. It was just ridiculous. And they even misspelled "expedition" on the back. We're gonna head up to Urquhart Castle to do a shot with Michael Karnow, our cryptozoologist. And-- oh, wow, John. Look at this. You're gonna get a fighter pilot coming right by. [Jet engine roaring] Wow. That's cool, huh? You know, I actually-- I wrote a movie about-- "Behind Enemy Lines." And I went out on an aircraft carrier. And I think that's when I really started to love being on the water. We may have break out that Nagra. I don't know. Gabriel: We started working, and the first thing that we had to do, we have to interview our-- our scientist. Werner: Professor Karnow, can you tell us about the monster? Sure. The so-called Loch Ness monster - is a large aquatic creature. - [Radio chatter] I'm sorry. I gotta stop. I hear the walkie-talkies in the wheelhouse. - David. - Hear the walkies. - David, the walkie-talkie. - Sorry. - Okay. Let's go. - Sorry, Werner. Still rolling. - Yeah. - You got some spray on it. - And rolling. - Professor Karnow, the third. The so-called Loch Ness monster is an aquatic creature that lives beneath these black waters right here. Um, is probably a reptile of size. Professor Karnow, do you really believe in the monster? Absolutely. I mean, there's been 10,000 sightings of this thing over 1,500 years. If you look at that, and you look at the Birmingham sonar readings, - basically cut-and-dry evidence. - Cut. Cut. Michael, that's fine. Yeah, that's fine. - Okay, Russell, we film back there. - We're good? Okay. That was very-- that was great, Michael. It was really great. Don't worry. It was great. - John: David, let me ask you something. - Yeah? I'm curious about the name of the boat, Discovery IV. What happened to Discovery I, II, and III? There weren't a Discovery I, II, and III. Then number IV. Why call it number IV? That was the producer's idea to call it Discovery IV. He thought it would sound more authentic. - Yeah? - Is there any way we can turn that radio off? - Especially while we're shooting. - No. Hmm. Okay. Well, I mean, you're really killing me here. I'm really not getting any good sound here, but all right, whatever. John: How do you feel about changing the name of the boat? Well, there's a tradition that by changing the name of the boat, you know, it's bad luck. Bad luck. You mean, bad luck for us? I hope not. Yes, I named the boat Discovery IV. That was my idea. You know, I thought it sounded cool. It was very important to me to build a credible expedition. That's why I had the jumpsuits. That's why I had that sonar. I wanted people to think and to feel like this was an authentic expedition to find the Loch Ness monster. Jacques Cousteau didn't go out in a boat called, you know, The Tweety Bird. You know, it had some cool name. I don't know what it was, but I'm sure it was cool. And Discovery IV. You know, Discovery IV. I don't know. To me, it just-- it worked. One moment Werner was downstairs in the hull and Zak pulls me and pulls Russell and said, "Come on. Come on. I need you very quickly. Very quickly." We are gonna be filming Kitana, an interview. And Kitana was going to explain something about the sonar. - You're gonna say-- - What's my line again? Say, "I'm gonna attach the antenna," something like that. - It doesn't really matter. - Okay. You jump in the water, you come right back out, we reset, we'll do it again. - Okay? I'll get water. - Okay. We're gonna wet my hair first. - You want me to hold that for you? - Yes, please. You don't want that to get wet. And then suddenly, that incredible girl pull her boiler suit out, and then she's with the tiniest bikini I ever seen in my life. And, Zak, why exactly am I wearing a G-string bikini? Because you are a model and you're a sonar operator. Okay? Let's get this done. Come on, guys. Okay, okay. Come on. Time is money. That's wet enough. - Here we go. - Here you go. - All right, guys. Let's roll it. - Okay. And speed. Sexy sonar one. I'm gonna set down-- let me restart, okay? Zak: Yeah, just do it again. Do it again. I'm gonna go down and set the sensor. My name is Kitana Baker. I am an actress and a model. Um, I've modeled for "Playboy" and I have been in the Miller Lite catfight commercials. And I've done some work for "Wild On E!" And a few small film roles. But, um... [gasping] Gabriel: So she went into the water. I mean, it was-- we just couldn't believe what happened. I can't do this. [Shivering] I'm sorry. It's too cold. That's okay. That's okay. That was pretty good. Can we reset? What's going on here? What's going on? Werner came out and literally caught us red-handed. Come on in. It's way too cold. This water is really cold. And then he pointed at me. "Gabriel, what are you doing?" Gabriel, what are you doing here? I'm just doing what I'm told. Werner: But you're burning all our raw stock. I mean, obviously I felt like I should point my finger to Zak and said, "He's telling me we have to--" Russell and I said, "We're making two films." Well, to me, it kind of trivialized what we were doing in terms of, you know, making a serious documentary. I mean, if it had come from Werner, then okay. Then that's all part of his grand design. But Werner was a little upset when he came back to the aft part of the ship and girlfriend was jumping out of the water, wet and cold. Zak, please, can you come in? Please come in. I need to talk to you. Guys, can you give us a moment? I need to talk to Zak here. My DP-- my DP out there is shooting, and I'm not around. - I know. I know. - What is happening there? I don't know. I don't know. It was a surprise to me, too. But you, as a producer, you should know what to do. - You have to stop him. - Right. Right. I'm the one who should call the shots. I wanted some answers from Zak. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on, but before he could even start to give me any explanations, all of a sudden Michael starts to yell that he had seen something in the water. [Tapping on window] - My God. - Is something wrong? - Nessie. - You're in my way. Look at that. Look. - Nessie. - What is that? David: No, that's the wake of a boat. It's just normally caused by the boat moving through the water. Oh. Oh, well. - Sound speed. - Camera speed. Okay, one. The question we ask ourselves is this-- why do they think that in these deep waters a prehistoric creature, some sort of a dinosaur, is dwelling? Why, out of all lakes in Scotland, are they coming here? Because this is the loch where the creature lives. And today is the day we're gonna find it. We've got Nessie weather. - We've got a light breeze, partly cloudy-- - Zak: Cut it. Michael. Michael, please. Michael, I'm shooting a film here, and when I'm doing a film, please don't walk into a shot. Oh, I understand, but-- but, okay-- you're not "yes and-ing" me, okay? I don't understand what you mean. Okay, basically-- okay, I'll add a piece of information, okay, then you add another piece of information. But if you negate my information, it stops everything. - Okay. - Look, I'm just glad we were able to do this. - We can interact this way now. - It's okay. It's okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. Russell. Is he serious, boss? Werner: Michael was a strange character. But in retrospect... when I learned everything, I kind of understand him much better. I think he was doing what he was told to do. - Tell me the position. - I need you a bit more-- - Like this? - Yeah. Good. - Okay, I'm rolling. - Rolling. - And speed. - Camera rolling. Number two. The question we ask ourselves is this-- why, in defiance of all logic, millions of people are coming to this lake here, believing that there's a dinosaur, some sort of a prehistoric creature - dwelling in the waters? - John: What is that? - Why, of all lochs... - Hey, Matt, did you see something in the water? - Didn't you see it? - I didn't see anything, John. - Oh. Okay. - Was it okay? - Russell: Clean. Very clean. - Sound okay for you? I know you did what you could for me as far as this engine. - Uh-huh. - But we have another big problem. This radio keeps going off in between and during the shots. - It's a big problem. - What radio? The radio-- the captain's radio. I got the walkie-talkies under control, but his radio's blasting all the time. If we could turn it down or get rid of it, we might get something usable. - Okay. Okay. - Do what you can do. Okay. A lot of strange things happened the first day on the boat and it looked like a confusing puzzle to me while I was working there. But at the end of the day, somehow everything fell into place and I knew-- I just knew that there was something seriously wrong. If we rented two cars, it would actually be cheaper than renting the one van. - Robert: Yeah. - Well, that makes no sense. Get the-- let's get the transpo guy in here and talk to him about it. Bring him in now. Let's get this worked out. There's no point in bringing him in now. It's-- you've got a meeting in 15 minutes. So... - Oh. Um... - We can talk to him in the morning. No, no. That's right. That's right. Guys, I'm sorry. I know I said you could shoot in here, but I've got a meeting in 15 minutes, so you guys actually have to clear out now, if you don't mind. - John: Sure, Zak. No problem. - Okay, good. Well, let's bring him in first thing in the morning, then, and... Hey, Werner. Let's bring him in first thing in the morning and we'll get this sorted out then - and we'll do it before we get on the boat. - Zak. - Yeah? - We need to talk. Okay. Can we go in the other room? No, just stay here. You know, I know what's going on. I know exactly what is going on. - What do you mean? - You're shooting with the cinematographer all alone and I'm not there and you have this girl in a bikini and she's supposed to be a sonar expert. Come on. I'm too long in the profession. I'm just too long in the profession to know what's going on. It's a hoax. It is just a hoax. I think you're really overreacting. No, I'm smelling a rat against the wind. When it's there, I smell it and that's it. - I just smell it. - Jesus. I don't know what to say. Zak, we are done. We're just done. John, you better get that fucking camera out of my face. I'm serious. Get out of my fucking way. - Zak: Don't pack your bags. - Werner: Get out, Zak. I just want you to get out. Just get out of here. John, come on. Listen, Werner... I made a mistake, okay? I mean, that's-- - What do you mean by "mistake"? - Well, I mean that I-- I-- You actually lied to me. You just lied to me. - Well... - That's a difference. Well, listen, you once said to me, "Cinema is lies." Come on. What do you mean by "cinema is lies"? Sure, there's a distinction. If you can't make the distinction, if you just can't make the distinction... why don't you become a talk show host? - Okay. Well... - Or become a prosecutor, become a lawyer. - Okay, well, I think... - Just don't make movies. Listen, I distorted things so that things would be more dramatic. I don't see what's so wrong about that. I really don't. I mean, okay, a couple of things didn't come out the way I wanted, but that doesn't mean you have to go pack your bags and leave. Don't give up on the movie now. You've got points on this movie, my friend. - You walk out this door, you sacrifice that. - I don't care about points. - Okay, well... - I just care about a good movie. Well, that's all I care about. That's all I'm trying to do. And if you walk out the door, there's no movie, okay? Everyone who works here, everyone who is working on this movie loses their jobs. I lose all the money I've put into it. - You lose everything you've done. - Don't talk about money. I know you don't care, but I care. - Why don't you make your own movie? - Okay. - Just make your own movie. - Lovely, John. I should have quit right then and there and I should have quit the day after and the next day and any day of shooting, but somehow I couldn't let it happen, to have a film shut down on my account. At least, that's something I told myself. Werner, uh, listen. There's some problems with the boat. I just want to give you the heads up about that. It's not... [engine sputtering] What's wrong? I don't know. It's not my engine. Zak: You know, we were always having problems with that boat. It wasn't just that day. You know, look, in retrospect, I don't want to point fingers about why it went wrong, although I do blame David because I think that he's the captain and he should be responsible for that. There were constant problems. But anyway, we got going. [Motor chugging] Zak was very insistent that I explain the sonar equipment. I had actually gotten this equipment from-- through connections I had to Jim Cameron's company. Under the impression that I was there to play the role of a sonar operator, I had done some research ahead of time. Zak: It was really authentic-looking. I mean, you know, Jacques Cousteau would have given his left nut for this thing and I just wanted to get some shots of it on screen. It's gonna make the movie look really authentic. Zak: And you'd think, like, whatever. No big deal. It would take us two seconds. But it was like pulling teeth. - It will show. Please. Please, I'm begging you. - Okay. - Okay. Great. - Are you ready? While we were filming that, the first real incident occurred. When I do documentaries, I operate with my eye open-- my left eye open. So both eyes are open. I'm constantly checking inside the camera and the reality. This is a technique that I learned and is very important. Documentary cameramen have to always have this eye open. Sonar one. And action. This is our sonar system. Gabriel: We were interviewing Kitana, and suddenly on my left eye, I saw something in the water. Something was happening there. Something there, very strange. So immediately I pan because I thought I'm gonna miss it if I don't do it. I saw Gabriel panning away from me. Zak: He started saying, "I see something. I see something." I turned and looked out the window. I started yelling at Gabby to stay on the shot. Werner: And then I saw you running and I just followed you out there. - Over there. - What's going on? - There's something out there. - Something underwater. Michael: Look, right there, in the water! Matt: Holy cow! What is that? - Kitana: What is it? - Matt: Is that a shark? - Rolling. Keep rolling. - Keep rolling! - It went under. - Where is it? - Michael: Over there! - Werner: Keep rolling! - John: Jesus. - Kitana: What is it? - Michael: There it is. - Werner: Are you pulling? Zak: What's everybody doing? What's going on? I was running around the other side of the deck. I saw nothing. When I got to the side of the boat, I admit-- there was some sort of little wake in the water which I was unclear about, but, I mean, it could have been a fish. - Kitana: Where? - Michael: Werner! Werner, look! It was moving towards us very quickly, and from the amount of water-- the sheer amount of water it was displacing, you could tell it was very large. There was, like, a shape moving in the water. It was very interesting, you know, like, extraordinary. Like something really, really traveling at tremendous speed. And I said, "Okay, I'll film it," and we were filming it. And Zak came out and said, "What are you doing?" - What's going on? - And I confronted him. Zak, come here. I need to talk to you. Look, you're gonna be shooting effects, you gotta give me a fair warning. - What? - I mean, you've got to give me a fair warning. I mean, I was about not to get it, honestly. Gabby, I have no idea what you're talking about. - I mean, if we're gonna do the effects... - Gabby, Gabby. I have no idea what you're talking about. What are you talking about? Zak, you've already been lying to Werner. You're not gonna be lying to me, okay? On one hand, I felt, okay, I'm understanding what Zak is trying to do and, okay, now he is not telling Werner the whole situation. He is not telling Werner everything about it, but okay. But then Zak was not even taking me into consideration on that, and suddenly he's just releasing all the effects and he was trying to make it like it all happened naturally. To be absolutely honest with you, it was a pretty good effect. The idea that I put something in the water that, like, you know-- whatever it was that Gabby said, that I had put some special effect in the water is absolutely insane. I mean, I'm not David Copperfield, for God's sakes. It's not like I could pull off a trick like this standing in the boat. It was crazy. Werner: We just kept staring at that water. Just at nothing else but that water out there. Things ground to a halt. Okay, they just stopped. The whole production just stopped and I tried-- I did my best to get things started again because, you know, that's my job. I'm the producer. I'm supposed to keep things rolling. But even Werner didn't seem to have any interest in shooting anything. He just wanted to keep looking in the water. David, let's wrap. Turn it around. Let's go home. Okay. All right. - Great. - Yeah, yeah. John: Hey, Russell, what happened out there today? You know, I don't think I saw anything, really. I mean, there was something-- some kind of disturbance in the water. I wouldn't say it was a creature. But I'm, you know, just looking forward to getting back home. That's my thought right now. These guys came along and they hired the boat and myself, you know, to do filming in the loch and, um... they reckon they've seen things. I've seen a kind of anomaly, you know, which I haven't seen before, but it's just getting a bit confused as to what they're up to now. It all just seems really contrived. You know, it's not what I signed up for either. Yeah, I think Zak's up to something. I don't trust him. I don't think it's Zak. I think that it's the other way around. - I think it's Werner. - Kitana: Werner? I think that Werner is running circles around Zak. If you think about it, think about who Werner is, think about who Zak is. Okay, but Werner is a very honest man. Zak seems to be taking advantage of everybody here. Or-- or there is some third entity who is manipulating both of them. There's some third person, an individual, and they're-- - Who would this third person be? - I don't know who this is. I think there's a game being played and we're watching the game played out. I think Herzog and Zak are both sort of on the board being played and we're all pawns as well. So, where do you come into this, Mike? I don't know. Maybe I'm the rook. Maybe I'm the bishop. I don't know who I am. Gabriel: Werner, it is a setup. It's a fabrication. You've got to believe me. I have to figure this because it was kind of strange what we saw today. I don't believe he can make a fabrication like that. He told me about the recreation, remember. - He was-- - Yeah, but recreation, you see-- if a winged cow would fly across the lake, then I would say, "Yeah. Well, that's some sort of a magic trick or something he's pulled off." But it kind of looked in a way that puzzles me. You saw how it rolled. You do a special effect in a different way. - I know. I know. - You just have a hump out, but it doesn't roll. It just doesn't roll. He-- literally, he's dragging you down and I just-- I have to tell you. I have to say it because I-- I feel that it is not right. He's taking us for a ride, both of us. But, okay, I just walk and go to a different film. But what he is doing to you, I mean, I have to tell you, Werner, it is not fair. There are forces out there and I think they're being manipulated. - Let's take a walk. - Huh? What? The rumor that we were perpetrating some sort of a hoax was spreading among the locals and I've seen that before. I mean, uh, doing a film like "Fitzcarraldo," there were wild rumors out we were doing bad things and violating civil rights of native Indians. All these sort of things. They happen and these rumors are like a virus, like a disease. Like wildfire, they spread and you just can't stop them. We want to know what's going on. Easy, easy, easy! - Hey! - We want to know what's going on. Nothing's going on. Do it. Do it. Do it now. Do it now. Watch it! Are you okay? Zak: I don't want to make some sort of blanket comment about the people of Scotland, but the fact that they picked on Michael Karnow of all people, I think is pretty low. I mean, this is a guy who wouldn't hurt a fly. Literally. He actually, he literally has a thing about flies. He will not hurt flies. And the idea that that's the person they chose to blame for, you know, the imagined goings-on on the water, you know, I think is sad. It's really sad. I've been on the phone all morning. I can't get in touch with Gabby or Russell. I need you to take the car, go back to the hotel, see if you can find them. - They checked out this morning. - They checked out? Yeah, I tried there already and they checked out first thing this morning. - Well, why didn't you tell me that? - Why didn't you ask me? So, where's Russell? Where's Gabriel? I don't really know, Werner. They didn't show up. So, no camera, no sound? You've shot 16-millimeter before. You could shoot the movie. Yeah. Fine. Perfect. - I'm gonna be the cinematographer. - Good. - I can do the gaffer. I can even steer the boat. - Great. - Do you know what? - What? This is the single most chaotic production I've ever seen. - Thanks. That's helpful. - And I've been on a couple of difficult ones. Yeah, I know you have. At least we're not dragging the boat over a hill. - What did you say? - Nothing. You know what, John? I don't want you guys on the boat today, either of you. - It's too disruptive. It's not good. - No, no, no. If I'm gonna shoot this movie, he's gonna shoot his, too. Okay. Fine. On the boat. It's not like I didn't see what he was trying to do. It's not like I wasn't aware that he was trying to make things worse. But I just figured as long as he's willing to pick up that camera and shoot, let's just move on. We'll laugh about this another day, which, obviously, we have not. You know, that other day never came, but that's a different story. 10,000 recorded sightings, 10,000 reported sightings, 600 valid or nonvalid sightings. I don't know, Robert. This doesn't seem to be working. Robert: You need to switch it on, Zak. There's a switch in the middle of the remote there. Oh, oh, yeah. Okay, so this one's left and right. - Mm-hmm. - What's this one? Is this yaw? Is that what this does? Is that the yaw? Probably not, seeing as it's not a helicopter. - Don't-- - I think that's broken. Don't get wise with me, Robert. Robert: There's some kind of safety switch on the actual thing as well. [Beeping] What's that beeping? - What are you doing there, Kitana? - It's chess. - Do you want to play? - Oh, no. I'm too lousy. I don't even know how the pieces are supposed to move. Kitana, do you think you could get that sonar rolling? I mean, the computer or whatever there is. I don't know. I mean, I did a little bit of research. I can take a look at it and see what I can do. All right. Let's see what we can do here. All right, first of all, this actually needs to be plugged in. - Plugged in where? - This is a wireless transmitter. - Mm-hmm. - And this needs to be set down into the water. All right. There we go. There's the signal. Thanks. It's working. Okay, cool. Let's do this. Here you go, Robert. - Grab that. - All right. Okay. Everybody ready? Werner, are you ready with the camera? - Yeah, give me some slack. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. David, you just get ready. When I throw this in, you're gonna hit the engine and start driving, all right? Yeah, Michael, you start doing your narration as soon as it goes in the water. - Okay? - All right. - All right. Okay, you ready? - I think that's enough. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - One... two, three! - Michael: 1,800 years. - Zak: Shoot it! Werner: We'll only be seeing the wake. Zak: I know, but it's floating away! It's floating away. - Look, it's perfect! - I'm not gonna shoot that. - It's perfect! - No, I'm not gonna shoot that. Zak: How could you not shoot that? Look at that. It's perfect. Just shoot it. Turn the camera on. Werner, shoot it. Look, it's in the water. It's perfect. This is just pathetic. It's pathetic. Just look at it. It's not pathetic. It's the money shot of our movie. - Take a look through the camera. - Shoot the goddamn shot. Stop arguing with me and shoot the goddamn shot. It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. I'm not gonna shoot this. This is so dumb. I've never seen anything as dumb as that. Werner, either you shoot the shot or I'm gonna shoot you, okay? I had heard the stories about Kinski and about Herzog directing Kinski with a gun pointed at him and, you know, I just thought, the gun was there and, you know, I wasn't planning on shooting him. Or I'm gonna shoot you, okay? Just shoot it. How does it feel now being at the other end of the gun, my friend? Go ahead. That's just a myth. I've never done that. I've never tried to direct anyone with a gun pointed. You know what? I'll direct you with a gun pointed right at your head, my friend. Pick up that camera and shoot. The story of me directing Kinski with a gun pointed at him from behind the camera, it's just a fabrication, a myth of the media. I'm just tired of defending myself against it. It has its own life. Why don't you take a good look? It's just a flare gun and it's not even loaded. - Just take a look. Just look at it. - Oh. [Thuds] What was that? Okay, that's it. We're heading for the shore. Do you see anything? What the hell was that? Something hit the boat, you know? I don't-- I don't know what it was, but something just rammed right into us. David: I was quite concerned about what was happening, you know, and I decided to head for the shore. Quite a fog had set in. You know, I was pretty concerned about that as well. Hey, guys, there's something following us. [Sonar pinging] David: Coast Guard, Coast Guard, Coast Guard. "Discovery IV" to Coast Guard. Do you read me? What's going on? What's wrong with the radio? Do you read me? The radio's knackered. It's broken. It is possible that I told one of the crew members to remove the guts of the radio because of the sound problems. It's possible. I'm not saying that that's true. It might have been David who did it himself. I don't know. I think we're losing it. [Pinging stops] [rattles] - Why did we stop? - David: Engine stopped. Can we start it? - I'm trying to start it. - [Engine sputtering] It will not start. David: We had a major problem. We were stuck in the middle of the loch with no power. Nothing. Now, Michael, tell me, why is this creature following us? - Huh? - It keeps following us. - I don't know. - Yeah, but you should know. You are the cryptozoologist. You're the expert. I'm not a cryptozoologist. I'm not a scientist. - What do you mean by that? - I don't know anything. - You asked me for credible, but obsessive. - Yes. Do you understand it's impossible to find both those? Impossible to find? You don't call this credible? - No, I'm not saying-- - This took me two months to grow this. - Michael, don't be a baby. - Baby? I'm a baby now? I can't believe this is the debate we're having right now. I can't believe this is what we're discussing. - I'm not saying you're not credible. - So he's paid? - Yes, he was paid. - Yeah, he paid me. He was supposed to pay me. He hasn't paid me a cent. So, he's a paid stooge. Stooge? What's that supposed to mean? - What's he talking about? - Now, John, tell me, who is real and who is not? You guys, you pissed this creature off. - What? We pissed this creature off? - What? He's probably chasing us because of that stupid thing you put in the water. Wait. What do you mean? It's chasing us 'cause of that thing? It probably thinks it's prey. - The plastic thing? - Okay, whoa. Now, hold it. I think that's an interesting proposal. I mean, why else would it be chasing us? Okay, that's just the stupidest thing I've ever heard. - I can't believe you think-- - Maybe it's not that stupid. Okay, you guys are going crazy. There's no other reason why it would be after us. Yeah, because we are food or whatever. [Sonar pinging] Quickly, Kitana, Werner. David: Then the sonar starts up again, giving us this echo, and, well, I was getting quite freaky by that time. I got everyone down below, out of the road, you know. I really thought something was gonna happen. Zak: There was a lot of tension down in that hold, and it wasn't even so much from the sonar. It was how angry we all were at each other. I mean, Werner was angry at me and so was David, and, actually, so was Kitana. And Michael was angry at Werner. I mean, everybody was kind of angry at each other. Werner: As I was sitting there in the hull, it dawned on me that whatever film I had planned had evaporated and your film, John, this study about my life, had turned into, maybe, some sort of a horror movie. [Sonar pinging] Kitana: There's something on the screen. What's it doing? [Sonar pinging rapidly] [thumps] David: Give me that pump! Get after that pump! - Get out of my way! - Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, guys. Go, go, go, go! Lance! Oh, my God, I got him. I got him! Lance, it's Zak. Listen, connect me to the Scottish Coast Guard. - Loch Ness. - Loch Ness. I don't know the number. Di-- Lance! Aah. Aah! Give me your phone. Give me your phone. All right. Here. Uh, was this working before? Were you getting reception? Yeah, but the battery's dead now. - The battery's dead? - Yeah. - God damn it! - Jesus! That's my fucking phone! Robert: What did you do that for? - Step back. Step back. - Whoa! Jesus Christ, Werner. Nobody's gonna come. - Why's that? - Everybody thinks it's a hoax. It's all anyone talked about in the bar last night. We're sunk, gents. That's it. Michael, we're not gonna make it. Just shut up. You're freaking me out. - [Sonar pinging] - Oh, God. Robert: Guys. [Thuds] John: He's fallen in the water! - Oh, God. - David: Man overboard! - Mike! - Michael, over here! You're swimming the wrong way! What is that? Michael, it's heading towards you! - Swim! Michael, swim! - Swim away! Get away from it! - Get away! Swim away! - Michael! Werner, let's throw this thing in the water. Okay. Throw it. Throw it over there. Kitana: Michael, you're swimming the wrong way! - I don't see him anymore. - He went that way. Kitana: Michael! Werner: Kitana, he must be out there. Michael! - I don't see him! Michael! - Michael! Kitana. Kitana. Where is Zak? Have you seen him? John: I haven't seen him, Werner. Kitana, I haven't seen Zak. And where's Robert? Have you seen him? I don't know. I'll ask David. - David! Have you seen Zak or Robert? - No. Life raft's gone. Werner: I couldn't believe Zak stole the lifeboat. I had only one thought on my mind: if I survive this, I was gonna find Zak Penn, and I would hunt him down and I would strangle him with my two hands. [Sonar pinging rapidly] [thuds] - Jesus! - Hold on. Hang on. Just hold on. Hold on. David, David, you are the captain of this ship. Aye, sir, I'm the captain of this ship and I'm responsible for the lives on board this ship. And I'm responsible for these people. - One of us should try to swim for shore. - No, no, no. Listen, I've told you before, the water is far too cold at this time of year. I've got one wet suit on board. I'm gonna put the wet suit on. I'm gonna swim ashore. I'm gonna put on this wet suit and I'm gonna swim. And this is final. John: What is that? Look. Look out there. Out in the water, what is that? Guys, I think it's the life raft. [Sonar pinging] Help me get it into the housing here. - Gonna have to-- - I will do that. My hands are shaking. There we go. Okay. All right. Here, take my flashlight now and help me guide it in. - Okay. - John, Matt. - Yeah, David? - I think you should come into the wheelhouse. - It's gonna be really cold tonight. - Okay, we'll be right in. - Okay. - Okay. Just take it around this. - This side here? - Yeah. Left side or right side? John. John, wake up. John. There's something going on outside. John: What's going on? - [Metal creaking] - [wind whistling] - John: Look at that. - David: It's coming at us. John: David, watch out! Look out! David? Are you all right, David? David. David. Is he okay? - He has a pulse. - Is he breathing? - Yeah. - David? Where is John? Where is Matt? I don't know. There's his camera. Werner: I don't know exactly why I picked up the camera. It was probably instinct from years of making films. There was nothing left to do at that point but shoot. - Werner: How is David? - He's still unconscious. Watch out! Watch! Watch out! - Oh! - I'll swim to shore. - Hurry back. - I'll make it. I'll swim to shore. Werner: There was something in the water ahead of me and I ducked beneath the surface to film it. It came right up to me. It actually hit me. Woman: Hey, Pete, say something at the camera for Helen. Hello, Helen. How are you? Happy birthday. How's college going? Your mama and I are here in Loch Ness, just starting our holidays. - The weather's beautiful. - [Zak panting] Don't stop there. Carry on. Tell her how much we love her and miss her. - Yeah, we send you our love and we hope to see you soon. - Help! Please! - Man: What's that? - Please. Help. - What's the matter down there? - Help. - What's the problem? - There's been an accident. Zak: You know, I can't tell you that I saw what hit us, but it was big. I mean, it threw us out of the raft. I mean, it was torn apart and we just swam, you know. I started swimming one direction and Robert, I guess, swam in the other. - Just hold on and we'll get you out. - Oh, God. I don't know what happened to him, you know. I can't tell you that I know whether he was attacked or whether he just sank or whether he died of exposure, you know, given that his body never showed up. I don't have the answer to those questions, but I do know that I just kept swimming. Woman: Is he all right? Would you shut that camera off, please? - Go that way. - Woman: I'm trying. Keep going. Keep going. It's up this way. Hey, you know what? Can I borrow that camera? Zak: Keep looking for them. They should be up there. - I don't see anything. - There's a bunch of people in the water. Over there. I see them over there. - Liz, give me a hand down here, quick. - I'm here. - Zak: Pull him up. - I'm here. - [Grunting] - Come on. I can't reach him. Zak: Is he okay? Liz: He's unconscious, but he's all right. He'll be fine. Zak: Hey, can you grab that yellow thing that's in the water? Just hold this camera for me. Be working. Come on. - [Beeps] - There we go. Oh, look at that. He got it. Liz: Hey, look, there's more people out there. Kitana: I remember the moment when the rescue boat pulled up, and then there was Zak filming me with a camera. Zak: John, the camera's rolling. You want to say something? Get the hell out of here, Zak. Man: We believe that two people have lost their lives. I don't know who these people are. That's not actually my department. And a couple of other people are either injured or traumatized, a little bit hysterical, so it's been very difficult to get any real information out of them as to the causes of this tragedy. My feelings are that something really went completely bad and the accident was created. We have seen that before. It has happened before several times. I think it was obvious to both of us that we had been had, and I-- I mean... as far as I'm concerned, we were had by Zak Penn. The radio worked at that particular time, and all I know, a couple of days later, you know, it wasn't working. I did go get the rescue boat. I pulled all of you guys out of the water. Well, I didn't pull you out of the water, but I supervised the pulling out of the water of every single person who was involved in that expedition. I don't know who is responsible for the death of Michael and Robert. Those are tragedies. Every time that there's even a minor incident on this loch, we get members of the public, we get people from the press, we get documentary television people like yourselves. It's absolute "pandelirium." They're all asking the same question. There's one word on everyone's lips, and that one word is "the Loch Ness monster." Well, no, in this case, it was just a tragic accident. That's all I can say. Werner: It was all lies, deceit, and in some way this film was doomed from the beginning. I think we shouldn't have even started the whole thing. It's one of those films that didn't want to be made. To me, it seemed to be like a stillborn child that just didn't want to come to life. Zak: You know, I'm a Hollywood screenwriter. I wanted there to be conflict. I wanted there to be excitement and adventure. And I thought that that had to be created. And what I learned was I didn't need to do any of that stuff, because what was happening to us was so much more interesting than the things that I was inventing. And that's what's so amazing is how much cooler the truth is than fiction. Werner: Finding the monster was never my intention. And so filming it was strangely unfulfilling and it left me questioning not only this experience, but many things I've done before. It made me wonder what I've been after. All this drama and pain to capture a few moments of light on a strip of celluloid. The truth did not seem ecstatic. It seemed vulgar and pointless. Zak: This is what we set out to do, and we did it, you know? I mean, it's pretty amazing. It was an adventure. It was epic. It was-- I mean, honestly, it was like something out of a Werner Herzog film. I don't regret any of it, you know? Was there a tragedy? Of course there was. I mean, people died, you know. That's always tragic, but that's what happens in any great adventure. Think about stories from ancient Greece or, like, a movie or "Lord of the Rings" or something. I mean, someone always dies. That's the way it works. But, you know, we achieved something. I mean, some truth was uncovered. We dreamt something incredible and made it real. [Music playing] Michael: The scientific community is very skeptical. So what you want to try to do is hit as many bases as possible. Eyewitness accounts, for instance, would represent one base. You add photographs, that's two bases. If you can hit five or more bases, you've got a home run. Rarely happens. Maybe it thinks we are smackerel of something-- a morsel, a good tidbit, a bite. I mean, what else have we done that would make it chase us? You look like a good bite, but I'm not. I'm not. I'm not a smackerel. When I look back and I hear people talk about what-- about suffering, I say to myself, "Who suffered more than I did?" I mean, other-- other than the people who died. I mean, obviously, they-- they suffered more because, well, they're dead. But you could make the argument that they're dead, so they're not really dealing with it. Whereas I live with the guilt and I live with the sadness. [Music continues]
