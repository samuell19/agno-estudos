-Did you get through? -No. -What did you buy? -A Fizz Pop. I asked for fruit. It's healthier. It's healthier! Let's go. No luck? She's not answering. What should we do now? Go back to Grandma's? No way! They would laugh at me. I can't go back there. Let's go. Let's go to Constantia. -Just go? Without a call? -It's fine. I will deal with it. Listen, Luthando. Please pick up our child tomorrow and drop her off. Wow! You want me to leave Gugulethu and be back here tomorrow? Please. I don't have a car. You know this. And public transport here stops at 6:00 a.m. You know I am not a morning person. Can't you ask this white woman to lend you a car? I am sure there are plenty in this massive yard! I'd have to leave there at 5:00 a.m. tomorrow. -Come on, bro. -5:00 a.m.! She's taking a while. She must be busy. Hello. Sisi. Hello, Sisi. It's me. Who is me? It's Tsidi, Sisi. Tsidi? What brings you here? Aren't you supposed to be in mourning? Yet you're here. Please open for me? Tsidi, I'm asking. I'll explain when I come in, Sisi. I am with my child, please open. Well, okay. Come in. Okay. What is it, young lady? Just showing up? At least call before showing up. Then I can expect your arrival. But you don't. You just rock up. This way. Madam is sleeping. Let's keep it down. I don't usually open the door. There are beggars out there. Mama! Come and see. Why didn't you reach out to Winnie's father first? -Look, Mama. -Come this way. Keep it quiet. Madam is sleeping. Mama, why are we going this way? Because Granny stays here. Come this side. Where is Luthando, since you're here with me? What room is this, Mama? Let me see what I can get you to eat from the kitchen. Are you hungry, Winnie? Yes, I'm hungry, Grandma. Okay, I'll go find something to eat. -Okay. -Can we stay? Yes, you can. But you know the rules of the house. I'll be back. Going to the kitchen. Mama, what are the rules? I want to know them. Don't worry about that. Please tell me so I don't get in trouble. So, when you get into the house, you can't run. You can't just touch the fridge. You've got to ask Grandma first. You can't go to the pool unaccompanied. You have go with someone. And the most important thing... Don't ever go into Madam's room. Okay. So we should pretend not to be here even though we are? -Yes. -Okay. Wow, Tsidi. Winnie is so grown. She is beautiful. Light-skinned, just like my aunt. She was so young when I last saw her. She's a grown woman now. You're raising her well, my child. Tsidi, I am talking to you. I hear you, Sisi. Oh, poor Grandma. I'm sure her funeral was beautiful. She really was a people's person. Poor Grandma. I am sure you're hurting, but please forgive me for not being able to make it to the funeral. -Where are you going Tsidi? -Getting fresh air. Fresh air at this time of night? I will cover myself. Wow. When you think you've seen it all. My grandchild You might see me laugh and assume I am happy You might see me laugh and assume I am happy Remember I said I'd show you the things in Grandma's kist? There is this coat. Feel how heavy it is? Grandma loved it! She'd wear it when it was cold. Remember how she loved wearing it in winter? -Yes. -When she was travelling. Here are her table cloths. Wow, she loved them. See how beautiful this one is? This tablecloth is also soft, right? And look how big it is! And then this one, because it is white. You needed to know that if you placed it soon after eating, you needed to fold and soak it in cold water. Not warm water, cold water. Grandma would cook, and call all her grandchildren, and we'd fill up the house. She'd put the tables together and place this tablecloth on top. Tsidi, you call this food? So mean! You know you've eaten all that food, right? I am kidding, cuz! You really cooked well. Don't worry, Mam'Tshawe. Your food was great! They're just jealous! Second In Command! Of course you'd say that. Stop it! Don't be silly. Tell me, Tsidi, what's the story with you extending the house? -This wall? -Well. I installed an en-suite bathroom, and now I will extend the walls to enlarge the room. -Okay! -You see. Who did you consult with? Was I supposed to consult someone? Yes. There are people here, Tsidi! You can't just do anything in this house without consulting us. I consulted Mama, brother. The one I lived with here, alone. Get it? Tsidi really has no respect for us. Mama! Wake up! Oh, Lord! Where's your father? Mama, we will be late for school! Tsidi, talk to the child. She's loud. Wait. Okay. Sisi! I hear you. Alright! Oh! Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a mess. Why didn't you tell me you were going to be late? It wouldn't make a difference. I was already on my way. It's not like you have plan B. What plan B? You're my plan B. You're going to drop her off as well, aren't you? Matsidiso! Why all this up and down? Why can't she just stay with me? That's not happening. "Up and down" is you coming to pick up your child! -Such a waste of petrol! -Oh, stop it. Just go! The kid is late. She'll get detention for no reason. We're leaving. -Bye-bye! -Bye. -Smile! -Go away! -Just go. It's late! -Smile! Hey, wow! See what I got myself into, being with you? Radebe. Bhungane. Mthimkhulu. Ngelengele. Mashwabada owashwabadel inkomo neempondo zayo. Grandma, forgive me. Forgive me for the way I left the house. Forgive me for arguing with Uncle before your ceremony had been completed. Forgive me for taking your coat before your clothes had been distributed. I am here at Mama's workplace with my child. Please be with me. Please protect me. You know how I feel about this place. Please be with me, Ma Radebe. Protect me, Ngelengele. Who are you to discipline my child? Who am I? That's my child! Don't you have a mouth? Can't you speak to her with your mouth? -Here she is, crying! -It's all drama. -What drama? -The same that you're full of! -This is my home, you hear? -Home? When were you last here? I am not going anywhere! Hey, girls! Tsidi, Xoliswa. Be quiet! As you know, my girl, I am the only one left among Mama's children. Toto will come and live with you in this house. Yes. This is for your own protection. You might as well be kicking me out. -How will I live here with Toto? -That is the end of it! There shall be no argument about it. This is for your own protection. This will not change. Mam'Tshawe think about this. There's nothing to think about, S'phe! Please, Tshiwo. Please, Mdange. Cuz! No, Tsidi. Radi's coat! Please, cuz. Let's go, Winnie. I am taking this coat! Tsidi, the distribution ceremony hasn't happened yet. You'll get bad luck, Tsidi. Sisi, did you see that dog? -A dog? -Yes. What dog are you on about? The one from here. With blue eyes. It died ages ago. Diane was never the same after it died. Where is Diane? Diane is in her room. She's unwell. Okay, what's wrong with her? She is just old. You do know that you're old too, right? I know that. I'm not unaware of it. Wow. The way you sprint when she calls. Of course! Diane does everything for me. Everything I do is for you and your brother. Hey, Tsidi, what are you doing... in Gcinumzi's room? Where is that Stuart of yours? Gcinumzi comes to see Diane and I whenever he gets a chance. I wonder if it would be to see you or his real mother, Diane. You love stirring trouble. -Hi, baby! -Hello! -I got 80 out of 80! -Who just dropped you off? Hannah's mother. Who's Hannah's mother? Where was your dad? -He didn't arrive. -Oh, Luthando! How can you just let a white woman... Her name is Samantha. Samantha. See, you don't even know her name! How could you give away our child? I didn't give her away! So what do you call what you did? She was happy to go with those people. She was happy because she's a child, and it's a fancy car! What if she hadn't made it home? I would need to go looking for her. Where would I begin? Where would I look? Who would I say she'd been with? If you were being a responsible adult, you would know where she lives. You don't know where she lives! Winnie! Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself? What's happened now, Tsidi? You don't watch this child! You see what's happened now? I do watch her! She's just a child. It's a mistake! She was playing! Look, it's broken now! Wow, Tsidi. -You're so ungrateful! -Ungrateful? Why? You're not bothered at all. Not bothered? Fine, I'll pay for your bell. -You have no respect. -She is just a child! What's there to be grateful for? She's hosting you here! This Diane of yours doesn't love you. She just wants your hands and strength! Hey, Tsidi! Where are you going? I am talking to you! Where are you going? To Gcinumzi's room. How can you go in there, who did you ask? I won't stay in that tiny shell of yours. -I'll phone Ross. -Phone if you want. I'll phone the police. -You want me arrested? -Yes. For wanting to stay in an empty house? You're always going on about how nice your madam is. And she is. You're silly, Tsidi. -Mama? -Yes, baby. Why don't you like this house? I like it. It is big and beautiful. -You like it, Sisi? -Yes. It's not that Mama doesn't like this house. But it seems this house doesn't like Mama. Get it? But how? -Mama grew up coming here, Sisi. -Yes. So, when I'm here... I get many memories. Bad memories. Okay. -But you like it here, right? -Yes. Who are these people? That's me. You. And Grandma. We all look so beautiful, my girl. And this house we live in is so beautiful. You want to stay with Grandma? Yes. We'll stay a bit longer. Okay. Here. Here. -Perfect. -Yup. Please be with me, Ma Radebe. There is no one else I can seek refuge in. You're my only hope. Sisi? Sisi? Why are you in the dark? Mavis? Mavis! Mavis! Mavis. Mavis, please come and open! Please come and open the door! Mavis! Mavis, your door is locked! Please come and open the door! Mavis open the door! Open it! Mavis please open! Come and open! Eat your porridge. You've only eaten your orange. Okay. Who is this, Winnie? I just drew her in. This is a family picture, right? -Yes. -Is she your family? -No. -So why put her here? No, Tsidi, that looks like that photo of young Diane. Are we Diane's family? No, Tsidi. The child was just drawing. It's not just a drawing. She made a family portrait. Why put white people in our family? She likes Diane. We have no white relatives. This was for the family. -Bye, Mama. -Is that Hannah's mother? Let's go out together. I want to meet this... No. You're still in your pyjamas. She is right. You can't go out like this. I'll walk her to the car. Hey, Granny! Today we're going to play with slime. I'm so excited! There is nothing wrong with this machine. It could be that you don't know how to use it. I told you not to break Diane's stuff. Sisi? The dishes in the sink? I washed them. Well, here they are. Diane, thank you very much for letting my daughter stay in the house. I don't know how to thank you. You know that one is so cheeky! You are right, Diane. She's just like her father. Hah, Diane! This tea! It's taking a while. Hey! These are Diane's things. How can you use Diane's things? It's fine. I'll wash them when we're done. -I don't use Diane's cups. -Why? These are Diane's things, Tsidi. Why not? I don't use them. I have my own cup. No, it's fine. I have already warmed these. These are the things that I like. We'll use those mugs later. Here is my cup. I'm trying to explain that I heated those ones. Just do what I asked you to do, Tsidi! I did it how you like it. I warmed the cups, heated the milk. Don't ever use Diane's things again. -Did she order you not to? -Here's my cup, Tsidi. She has you living under apartheid! It's not about apartheid, Tsidi. I just like this cup. And stop talking to me about apartheid. But that's how you choose to live. Is it you doing this or is it your madam? Tsidi, I like my job and I like Diane. You like her way too much. It's abnormal. Wait a second! Wait. It sounds like Diane is calling me. No, Diane is not. She's calling me. I heard her. What you're doing is not normal, Sisi! Mother of Winifred! Are you okay, bro? I am okay. Are you okay over there? This house, it's weighing heavy on me. When I try to tell Sisi, she doesn't get it. I don't know how to approach her in a way that she'll get. Why don't you ask that coconut, Stuart? Where would I start with that coconut? I'd need Google just to communicate! Don't put me through that. I can't... I'm going to sleep, baby. Wait, am I disturbing you? -No. -Okay, I will call you. Hey? -You'll phone me? -I will call you later, okay. No, feel free! Go have fun, dude! It's cold. Go and cuddle somebody! Haha, so silly! Cool. Cool. -Mama. -Hello. I saw graves down there! Stop it, nothing like that there. She is telling the truth. There are graves up there in the garden. No way! They belong here. These people bought this land long ago. They've lived here long. -No, Sisi. -So they did everything here. Even their workers were buried there. -They buried workers? -Yes. I don't think that's even legal. It is legal. This is their land. Wow. If you could change anything in this house, what would you change? I don't think I would change a thing here. How long has this house been like this? All these years, you'd change nothing? There is nothing I would change. It is Diane's house. But you say this is your family. It is my family, but I can't just change things. She should tell me to change a chair or a table. I have no right to just do what I want. Okay. Let me just... No, Sisi! You're off duty today. Diane is calling me. She shouldn't call you when you're off duty. You're not her slave. She doesn't even give you a raise, this Diane. None of your business! Sisi. May I please have Gcinumzi's number? What do you need Gcinumzi's number for? Just so I can find him if I need him. I don't have it. He's the one who calls me. I should phone, but I don't want to disturb him. Okay. Madam! Diane! Madam, are you alright? Diane! Madam! What's going on? Did ma'am have a stroke? Or a heart attack? Shall we phone Grant or Ross? Tsidi, we won't be phoning Ross or a doctor. Diane is going to be okay. Do you understand, Tsidi, that Diane is my problem? How can she be your problem? You're old. You're not qualified to... Okay, let's rather call Gcinumzi. We won't be phoning Gcinumzi, Tsidi. I told you, Diane is my problem. My burden. I will look after her. How, Sisi? How? Tsidi, you don't understand any of this. Do you get that if Diane is placed in elderly care we'll have nowhere to go? Do you understand that without Diane here I will have nowhere to go? You and your child will have nowhere to stay? What do you want me to do, Tsidi? There is no other home besides this one. This is my home, Tsidi. You don't understand what's going on here, Tsidi. You don't understand the pain we're facing right now. What will we do if Diane dies? What will we do? Listen, Sisi. I'm sorry for the way I have been behaving. It's just that I am still heartbroken. I miss Grandma. I also miss her too. -But we'll be okay, right? -Yes. -Do you forgive me? -Yes. Thank you. -I love you, okay? -Love you too. -Coming now, okay? -Okay. Sisi, you shouldn't be using sugar. Oh. You know, you're right. Do you see why I don't use Diane's things? Look now. Sisi, please forgive me for saying that Gcinumzi only comes here to see Madam, not you. You know, Tsidi, this Gcinumzi issue, I didn't give him up. I didn't give him up to Diane. It was my wish that she'd help me with Gcinumzi, so he could have a good life and a decent education. -Are you okay, Mama? -Yes. I'm tired. Of course you're tired. You're too old for this big house. Oh please! I will not die. Switch off the stove. It's good to relax after a busy day. An average day, but a busy day. These fellows wearing the warm coats spend a good part of each day just searching for food. I acquire this field of yours which you love. I eat and carouse in it. I drink and plough in it. I reap in it. I copulate in it. I do not perish in it... for my magic is powerful in it. Mommy. Can I please have R50 for the school trip? What school trip? You didn't tell me about any trip. I did tell you Mommy, like a month ago. But... Sorry, I don't have it. Sorry. But, Mama! Waking me up with all this English, Winnie! What's gotten into you? I'm telling you, you didn't remind me. But all my other friends have money, and I don't. Go to school! I've no money. I'm telling you, I don't have it. There's nothing I can do. Come, child, it doesn't matter. I will give you the money. Let's go, your transport is waiting outside. Oh, Sisi. You helped me with that child. Yes. I don't know what's got into her. Because she isn't that type of person. Maybe she misses her dad? Maybe I should take her for the weekend? Don't you think? Tsidi, what's really happening between you and Luthando? Oh, please. Nothing is going on. We're just raising our child. Oh, yeah? I really liked him. Shame. I thought he was the one. But nothing happened, so it doesn't matter. It's clear he wasn't the one. It's like that sometimes. Life. You know, standing here, looking at you, you look just like Mzwandile. Your height. Just like Mzwandile's. And your stubborn nature, Mzwandile's! He was just like this. Didn't listen. But wow! It was lovely. We'd go to the movies. We'd go to the Kismet, returning on a bus, "Two to Mowbray!" Hey! It was lovely, child. Everyone had a companion. All of us on the bus. Each of us partnered. Here next to you would be a couple. And over there. No singles! That'd be "Two to Mowbray," child! It was lovely, then. Mzwandile really made me happy. He was such a hunk. Even the way he dressed! He didn't just throw clothes on. He wore genuine fabric. I received so much love from him. He was my rose. I'm imagining him. And Gcinumzi's dad? What kind of person was he? Gcinumzi's dad was my spare wheel. -You know what, Tsidi? -Yes? Things I would change in this house. I would change these many tables. And those ugly dolls. I don't know what's with these old men with beards! I don't know what's going on. And the cupboards. The house is dark! So gloomy! When you enter a room, it's so dark! -It's just so dark! -So dim! And all those bells! And moving all those things when I clean! Dusting them... Expecting someone? No. Hey! How's it, Mama? Are you well, Gcinumzi, my child? Yes, I'm good. Oh! Gcinumzi! It's been a while. Good to be home, Mama. -Let me make tea. -Thank you. Hey, Tsidi. How are you? I'm fine. Ah, jeez, this looks nice. -What are we making? -I made some soup. Yes, I can't wait! I know that me and you are not very close, and I don't usually ask you for anything. But I'm really worried about Mavis. Mavis is old, and she's not coping anymore, you know? Just the other day Diane fell, and Mavis... Wait, Diane fell? What happened? No, she just had a fall. But Mavis was unable to help her. So, did you call a doctor? She was sleeping. Listen, let me just go check up on her, and I'll be back, okay? -Okay. -Okay. I'm not ready. Listen, it doesn't have to be all of her, only her hands. How's Diane? Yeah, she's hanging in there. Are you going to call Grant or Ross? Um... I think I'll just wait and see how the next week or two goes. I saw this picture of Mavis in library... and it had these markings behind it. It's a spell. And the spell talks about a person becoming a helper to their master in the afterlife. This is all confusing to me, and I know it sounds insane, and it doesn't make any sense... No, Tsidi. Look, um... I'm also worried about Mavis. I think she's been working for too long now, and I think it's about time she slows down and considers her own needs. Exactly. And yeah, I know about her high blood pressure. Yeah, I'll talk to her. -Thank you. -No problem. Thank you so much. Mama, there's no easy way to say this. But Diane's health has been deteriorating faster than we had expected. It's safe to say that she will be leaving us soon. Everything's going to be okay. Alright? You've been a part of this family as much as I have. And you've done so much work. I think it's... I think it's time for you to rest now. Mama, listen to me. You don't have to worry. You'll be taken care of, Mama. Mommy. What are you doing? Mommy. Mama, I need help. It's bad, Mama. I don't know what is going on here. I don't know if I'm losing my mind. All I know, Mama, there is a bad spirit here. The dark spirit is surrounding us. I can't live with my child in a place like this. Please help me. Please protect me. Please help me, Radebe. I have nowhere else to turn to. Help me, Radebe. Help me, Bhungane. You might see me laugh and assume I am happy Mama? If you were to see my heart, I am unhappy You might see me laugh and assume I am happy My heart aches I am unhappy I am unhappy Mama? Mama? Luthando, listen! Please come. Please come and fetch Winnie and I. Please! Please come at once! Winnie? Winnie! Come, Sisi! Are you okay, my child? Please go and pack, Sisi. We must go! Mama! I don't want to pack. Tsidi, what's going on? I spoke to Mama. I can't stay. We must leave. Go and pack, my girl. Tsidi, since Grandma died, everything about you is odd. Always in her coat. In pyjamas all day. You fail to understand. She was my mother. She was a mother to me. You don't know me! You're absent! I have no birth mother! -Tsidi, calm down. -I will not calm down! My birth mother raises white kids in the suburbs! I'm staying! I'm not going anywhere! No! Tsidi, what the hell? The security company called. What's going on? Hey! I'm telling Sisi that... Hey you! I'm trying to tell Sisi we need to leave here... Go to Gugs with your noise! We don't do this here! Gugs? Because that's where I belong? I don't deserve these free, safe spaces... Don't be so dramatic for once and listen to me. I'm dramatic? This place will kill her! -I will not stop! I will not! -What's going on here? -You stay out of this! -Hey you, back off. Tsidi, you have lost it. Lost it? You're the lost one, Stuart! What's going on? I'm trying to tell Mama it's dangerous here! People get killed and buried here! Mama, I don't want to go back to that dirty, stinky place! Matsidiso! Why are you hitting the child? Why are you hitting the child? What is your problem, dude? -It's not my fault! -Not your fault! Nothing is ever your fault! People are bewitched or brainwashed. But nothing's your fault! I've had it with you and your family! Jesus! Come, baby. Baby? We'll stay in Gugs, okay? Luthando. -Luthando, give me my child! -Do you hear me? Matsidiso! Winnie will stay with my mom. She'll be looked after. You can visit. But for now, fix your family issues. Winnie, please get out of there! Give me my child. You're going crazy. You need help. Open that car, Luthando! Bring my child! Open that car! This is too much. Dragging me into her family's madness. Give me this child! Luthando! Seriously, Tsidi! Are you alright, my baby? You'll be alright? Sorry, my baby. You'll be alright. Mom will be alright. Give me my child! Tsidi? Tsidi, get up. Tsidi? Tsidi, you alright? What's going on? Tsidi? Can you hear me? What's happening to you? Mavis. Diane is going to be leaving us tonight. You've been a part of this family for so long and... just trust Diane's decision. You don't have to worry, Mavis. I'll make it quick. No, no, no! Gcinumzi, what are you doing? Gcinumzi! Let go, mama! Gcinumzi! Why, my child? Don't die, Gcinumzi! Don't die, my child! Gcinumzi! Come, Tsidi, help me! Gcinumzi. Sisi? I acquire this field of yours which you love. I eat and carouse in it. I drink and plough in it. I do not perish in it. For my magic has power in it. Diane, you would do this to me? Hey, Diane! How could you do this? Get off, you witch! Fuck off! I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, my child. Shh. Be strong. Get up, my child. We've got work to do here. It's time to get up. Get up, my child. I'm sorry. Get up. Hi. Hello. -Alright? -Mm-hmm. And then? What's up with the maid's uniform? Oh, stop it! It is what it is. -Cool. -Okay, cool. -Bye, Winnie! -Bye. -Bye! -Bye. Hi, Diane, how are you? You look very good today. Guess what? There's a phone from Ross and Grant. From Australia. Mavis. No, she's fine. She's just tired. Everything's under control here the other side. Yeah, and how are you and your children? Yes. Wow, I would be very happy to come there to visit. How old is the other one? Um... Jason, how old is he? Yeah. Yeah, I remember. Yes, Mavis. You always know just what to say, hey? But thank you for looking after her. And we are looking after ourselves, and you must look after yourself too. Don't worry, my baby, we are. Okay, we'll chat soon. Thank you for everything. Bye, Grant, speak soon. Okay, bye. Ross. Ross! Mom's fine. Everything's cool. Mavis has got it under control.
