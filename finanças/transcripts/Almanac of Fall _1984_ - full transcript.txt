Even if you lead me This land is unknown The devil is probably leading Going round and around in circles. Pushkin ALMANAC OF FALL Written and directed by Editor and co-author Cast A long, long time it lasts... sticking to a lie because it gives you a hold. The unadmitted truth is that you can't face the fact that it's all over. I always lied to myself that it wasn't all over, there's still something, not now... but soon, later... Interesting enough, when I saw there was no continuation, I got cold feet and said it can't be like this... ...something like that... I said I think it's instinct or something... it won't work out, I'll start within to build, as if... Frightening, how much the body can take... and so... Bodies recognise each other... souls have gone... it's over... how much has happened when it has to end... Yet it still works... still works... ...well, needs... routine things come back to... ...how long you can... But what can you do ...dream... - That. -No? - That. And in your imagination in the end... then what will happen... what will happen... the doorbell rings! So what happens if I open the door? I realised, I can't handle it... because... there must be a distance because that's how I handle it. That might be too much... So many times I dreamed... about one more encounter, what it would be like after fourteen years, but then... I don't want to see hair that had once been black be grey. I don't want... to see realities... then no future... Why, isn't there anyone, who you really think... it won't work? Can nobody manage that? No. Are you sure? Yes. I always thought this only happened to me... I've always lived in someone else's flat. Never connected to things or furniture, always someone else's, so luckily it was easy to leave. But I've got used to that, I wouldn't know what it would be to own something. I don't even know if I'd love you then. Now I think I do love you. It's also possible that I wouldn't. So that's what I think of you. You know... if there wasn't a room to come home to, which is still good to have. But if you ask a friend... or you have to meet some place, ...would you come with me? Would you still be here with me? If I don't see you for two days would you come on the third? I have this mania now... to give it a try, see how would it be... if I had a solid, what?.. Base... Something which is mine, nobody can send me away. Where no one can turn me out. Because it's my very own. Perhaps then I... would be different then. Perhaps I'd brush my hair just for myself, perhaps it'd feel good perhaps it'd be good to get up in the morning perhaps it wouldn't annoy me when the alarm goes off at 6... Because I'd be making coffee in my own kitchen and perhaps I'd be glad to see you come home at 6. Perhaps I wouldn't be glad, and say, now why did you come here? Today I'm waiting for... somebody. So, the way you talk and I'm not teasing... ...all the same... everything you say... it tells me I don't need a flat. I don't need anything else... somehow, despite the will... - You don't need that? - Nothing. - So what do you need? - Nothing Not me? I need you... I'm your mother, you're the one and only... who worked her life in all honesty... - ...to give you the chance... - And whoring all your life. - I did what?! - You heard. I did what? I didn't hear you. So just shut your mouth and get out... - I won't. - We've been thieving...? - Don't you touch me! - Hit me and I'll kill you! Me? You. That I'd like to see! - That I'd like to see! - You will. You will... - I've had enough of your hysteria. - Hysteria? I'm saying... Hysteria. To tell some swine of a man to stop living off me. And if I once say, son let me have some money? Because I'm getting old and I can't earn much more. You have enough... You want to drown in it...? Booze, sluts, poxy friends... That's your idea... Listen, I don't give a shit that there's not enough... Get your hands off... Listen to what I'm saying. I've more right to this flat than you have, besided you'll be rotting soon. it'll be mine anyway. Then you can do what you like. Until then, my word counts. - He's moving in... - He is not - Just for a week. - No, not for a day I don't want to discuss it. Nor me, excuse me. You won't get your way here... If you'd ever done anything, then you'd have the right... Show me something here that you brought in! That you gave me. In your 30 years. What? What have you brought in? Rubbish, filth. - And shame. - And what have you done? I won't waste away, to be sure. I still have emotions, ideas, plans, if you want to know. - What plans? - I'm still working. - For this place! - You've become and old cow. Say what you like, but you won't get me angry. I won't rot away the way you want me to... And how long do you want... As long as I live, dear. - Then I hope it'll be soon! - That I'll die soon? - Yes. Thanks. That your mother dies? - Don't try that again! I've had enough of you. I'll kill you! Lay a hand on me again, and I'll kill you! Have you got that? Agreed. Right? You'll kill me? Kill me! - Is this good for you? - No. So then? And you let her? - Complaining. - Sorry? Complaining. Who? Your mother? True, she's always complaining. She has money though, you know that. I know. She could easily have given you... You don't know her... I know her a bit better than you. Excuse me for what I'm saying but as long as she's alive, you won't leave here. And you won't be able to start a new life. It's easy to take you in... She cries a bit and what she says, you believe it all. Don't take her serious. Not seriously, when she starts sobbing. She's the happiest when you're desperate and beg her forgiveness on bended knee. When you confess you're a bad boy and feel guilty. She does that to all of us. All the same, you're her son. Aren't you a good little nurse! - I'm not a nurse now. - I know that. Sorry, you don't believe me. Look, I never hurt you, did I? What makes you say that? Because I sorry for you. Because I thought that... It's all the same to me. But you could start a life [ Skipped item nr. 176 ] At this age, a man should be thinking about her mother and not be coming here for money. Not to mention the tone he uses about it, not even a stranger would take that from him. It's not acceptable that after he comes you're ill for days. When we're together, there's two of us! It's all calm, peace and quiet in the home. And that's what you need. The way he treats you is not right. And you should be glad you were able to say no. In his own interest. It's good for him this way. If he ever gets any sense, he'll recognize this too. Have you seen what this maggot has done to you? I worry for you, I pity you, this will ruin you. Now he's smuggled this teacher in here and you don't even know who he is. Idiotic, isn't it! Could you hold it? It'll be better soon. They grow and grow, then they're not 20 but 30... and still behave like small children as if they had no responsibility to anyone. It's true too... it was hard for us to get through the fights; To survive, make a life, to develop. Get letters from abroad, lose touch, remain alone. But... where you can turn to for help? It's a battle... and alone you fight to the end. I can't shout up, What have you done to me? And look at the outcome! And... that's why you start getting tired... Because that's... the narrow path and you say, that only, only leads to ruin. But it'll be shorter. And will it always be harder? How can that be? We are a generation that cannot relax. But why? Why do they think that they can put the burden on us, why? The reliable generation. We can stand up straight! No answer, is there? Well, to that all I can say, is If you so clearly and openly can speak of the problems of what you feel or think... then you, yourself, are really very strong! If someone is weak, they couldn't say what you did. Look, I know I'm strong. But you see it doesn't always work. In such case... I don't mind that this all came out you need to cry sometimes. Good for the nerves, they say. I once read somewhere, somebody wrote a little weep every day, that life would be much easier You should talk to him for your own sake. He's a guy who's up to something. Crazy or not, however old, she is, H?di is still... A woman! So shouldn't I ask him what he's up to or what? No. Have a talk with H?di and then with Tibor too. I may be wrong. Everyone lies to me here. I've been here too long, there is too much.they think about me, believe about me. And after all you are... "A man!" Exactly. Yes. Anyone who listens to H?di for three-quarters of an hour... has some reasons for listening her out. Aren't you listening to me? I said I'd talk to him, really. To who? It's my view. To who? To that guy. Tibor. That's his name. You don't even know his name. I do. Tibor. You don't care who's here? Be serious! Spend time with him too in this flat, Don't just take up one room, but live here! Try to be here, and get to know the people you're living with... On whom so much depends! - All right! - Close your eye. Something's there. But... I got it and I'm very grateful... but... but, when you gave it... But... When I asked for it I was certain I could give it back inside a short time. Unfortunately it turns out I can't manage that now. So you, you shouldn't accuse me, I'm not that type. I'll give your money back, believe me. I'll do everything to give it back. What can I say... I'll put my soul into it, believe me... I can't, I can't give you any guarantee because... Well, it happens, that now... like what came up was that my life may come up different now... So believe me, I will give it back. For God's sake, I don't know what to say, but well, I don't have the money now to pay you. But I will... See, I thought, I believed when I asked for a loan that my situation would change within a short time, so... I believed, I belie... don't be upset... So when I asked for a loan, I thought I'd be able to cover it... In theory I wasn't. In practice... I felt I was... I'll give it back, believe me I don't know what... what to do. Don't do that! Please, don't do that! You'll put me in an awkward situation, don't do that! I'll give the money back. Trust me, just... give me a deadline! I just thought... because you haven't been here long... well - I don't know... if you've got problems, then so I think, the best is... to talk them over with me. In things like that she trusts me. Push it out! That's it. There's a bit over there. Thanks. Perhaps, if... if it so happens that I need something I'll ask you to help me. You can talk to her. She's nice, H?di. We'll see, I may not need it but anyway... Yeah... of course... You've come a long way... and I never thought I can still have someone, I swear! There'so unusual things happening to me nowadays. First, you know, for a long time the two of us were living here me and my son. Then it so happened that we had to take Anna in, who helps me, I have to get these shots. Then came her love. And I was so glad, because it was bad to sit here just to wait for my son to come home. I was alone. I began to feel afraid in the house. And I was glad to have people here at last, I only had to go out there and there they were. And that really put me at ease. I don't know how to say this but for a while now... You know, when an eye, which so far was clear, I felt nothing behind the look... and then once, or in my imagination? Don't know... I felt they look at me differently. Look at me, speak to me as if any word... was a lie. I don't know how to express it how it is somehow it isn't the way it was. It's strange I don't feel the coldness, only the falseness. And I'm not sure if it's my hypersensitivity or just my imagination, because... I always mystify things it may be because... I'm afraid. I'm really afraid these days. I don't know if you know Anna or talked more with her ? But why, all of a sudden, have I become afraid of them? I don't dare to say it out loud but I'm beginning to be afraid of my own son. He's so stubborn, so self-willed... He looks at me as if I'm a stranger, an enemy. Well, this is madness. You don't think that your own son... I don't. No, no... ...who's really nice, anyway... I can't imagine, just all of a sudden it all comes out, I don't mean it, or do I? How can a thought like that cross my mind? What I'm afraid of, is... what is that? - No. no. no. - Of course, no. He's a terribly nice guy, only he has his own... - Well, I didn't mean that, just... - I know... You mustn't think of such things... Lets drink some champagne and then afterwards... - ...it's a birthday, isn't it? - A celebration, and now I'm crying. - Cheers. - Cheers. Excuse me. Now why did he rush off? J?nos, why did you run off? Go to bed. I don't want to, don't you see, you fool? Come and sit beside me. I won't sit down. Come on over here. Sit here. No, no. Go to bed. Away from there and go to bed. Come and sit beside me, you idiot. Don't do that... Away and off bed. Come here you idiot! Do you know your mother? She's a wonderful lady. If only once I could have her... stroke me the way she stroked you... Go to bed! Why should I? Because I'm fed up with you. Come on... What do you want? Leave me alone! Believe me. if only once... she'd touch me like she would touch you... stroke your head, then I would be a happy man... Off to bed. I won't... leave me alone. Believe me. I'm an old man... Go to bed. Get up and go to bed, right? I love your mother! Off to bed. Are you crazy? Come here, for God's sake. Off you go to bed. I have to tell you something. There are few people in my life that I did love. That I've understood. Your mother is one I've understood and I've understood why I love her. And you. Now off you go... That's it and you're going to bed... I don't want to, you pig. Go to bed! There's your hat. Go away, brute. You beast. You stay here, go to bed! I'm fed up with you. You stay here. Stupid brute! You're crazy. Are you going to bed? No! Can I have one? Up to now I've lived my life... in a slightly humiliating way. I'm a man who's inhibited. Very inhibited. And I felt that, that... I don't know, don't know... Everything I've done so far... I've always been embarrassed for everything... I felt that, that... how can I say... there's more expected of me then I can give. And... and I don't know if I'm capable of it. It's a terrible conflict because I feel that I'm not... capable. Yet I know that's what I'm called for! To give something. And I'm afraid of not being able to give. I'd like to produce something. In school kids sit there, and I'm embarrassed because I don't know what to do. For another generation I'm already old but I have to give them, some kind of belief that they somehow... they ...they should go on. That they could believe what I say. That they should believe. It's worth doing. That they must live! You have to go on for something... I don't know why you have to go on, because you don't have to go on, because we are going step by step, constantly... towards a catastrophe... towards a catastrophe. The end to everything. But you have to live. You have to love something, I don't know what it is, because I don't love anything. But you have to go in some direction. And I suppose it'd be good if I found someone I could live pleasantly... what a fucking idiotic word "pleasantly"... I need someone who'd accept all my nonsense, all my idiocies, who... who'd be able to live with me and and accept my drinking, being brought home drunk. Accept my being put to bed accept it... that'd be a man I would think. But probably there's no such person. I am... in fact, an unfortunate man. Perhaps that's not true. Perhaps that's not true. I'm an unfortunate man. But... something... I cling tooth and nail to is that I found something, I have a dream and idea why can't I realize it? Why? I went to bed with the Teacher. It's never been so good with anyone in my life. What do you say to that? That's news to me but I'm glad. Good. - I thought you'd be angry. - Did you? Why? Why? Well, he lives here... But why should I be angry? Order in the house... You brought one boyfriend here now the other is here, very comfortable, isn't it? Well, more than comfortable. Very well then. You don't mind? About what? The situation. - Well, it's your business. - That's fine then. So it went off well? Yes. I never thought of it. I didn't, actually. It never entered my mind. He's been hanging around... This is when something can be done. What do you have in mind? I don't know. Perhaps killing someone? The Teacher bites. Bites sharply. He has huge teeth, you know beautiful hairy hands, and big flat fingers, take a look at them once. When you see him next. But don't laugh. Disgusting, disgusting, like an animal. I'd never have believed I'd have enjoyed it. But I did. You know what I'm like, I am always like it when someone's nice to me, stroke me or love me, or at least I thought that was good for me... like an animal... But that this... this could be good... I'm not sure, if we were not too noisy. I hope we didn't wake you up. That's good. Very interesting. I feel great. Better than I've ever felt before... yet... he's quite horrendous... the Teacher, I mean. And now... Well, yes... Yes what? Things are shaping up in my house. Don't worry, it won't be like this. I won't turn the house into a brothel. After all I didn't want this, it's not my fault. It turned out this way. It happened. That dress really suits you. You've got lovely hair. The life of instinct. Actually, I think if I were to go into this then... there are no sinners no victims... we follow our instincts. It's nobody's fault, isn't it? Well, that's human nature. Why do we call anyone to account for anything. Or these laws are either imprinted in us or not. Who is the sinner? Does sin even exist? We have situations, we have nerves, we have desires, we have bodies... Isn't that so? Did Anna go to bed with him? I think so. But is it that interesting? Situations can be tempting. I don't think it has to be seriously considerred. They say we should be expansive, open-handed. How many times you'd like to shout, why... no sense. In German, "es war nicht so gemeint"... not meant to be. It won't go one step further. So what does Anna actually want? Just to flirt a bit, I think. Female instinct. I don't think it's to be taken that seriously. So she wants to drag you out of the depths, out of indifference, out of indifference, to have something new... something... refreshing... And so it will be! Now you've gone all sad. No. I've not known you like this. It worries me a bit have I been indiscreet? Or said something that was news for you... now you've made me feel embarrassed. Perhaps it confused me a bit, my comfortable indifference that's been established here. But perhaps it didn't. Well. It didn't. So, I've got to the point of telling you your relationship with H?di will only... will only work if somehow you can have some influence on Anna. That's certain. Honestly. No kidding. No. I'm not having you on, our thing has got tired. That's putting it mildly. Still, you're young. That is... if you can be nice to her and if that doesn't give you any problems, I'm sure your relationship with H?di can be sorted out. That is, everything will be clearer, if the power Anna has, which I find immoral, you can somehow exercise an influence on it. So, I really don't know... I don't know... You understand, don't you? I'd like to tell you again, very clearly that the sexual relationship you've developed with Anna, I warned you at the start, in this house, well, that kind of thing I wouldn't welcome... You may have money problems and there I can say I'm ready to help, but one thing you must know if you want to stay here, is to somehow make up your mind that we're not jigging around one foot forward, one back, in this house I am the master. I want you to be fully aware of that. H?di, dear. Yes. One moment please. I see you're right and the reason for it all is, well, I've been drinking a bit more than I should, I promise to go on a cure. And all I ask you is to have a little patience. - All right. And do a little thinking. And do a little thinking. Why does it have to be this way? Why? I'd like so much if I too had a son who has a future. So I could relax. Start doing something. Start... It'll go well once you start. All you have to do is start. I'm so tired now, son. You've nothing to say. You're not listening... the only words you start with are "Give me money"! That's not much. Not much at all. What do I do? Tell me, what can I do? I speak. I speak like a deaf. - You're not listening. - Get out of there! I can talk to you all I like. All right. I'm sorry, that's not how I wanted it... I'd only like you to talk to her. Tell her I need the money. Tell her to give me some. Have you asked her? I have and more than once, she didn't give me any. That's why I'm asking you, see? Tell her it's really important. She didn't give you any? No. I'm sorry... I don't want to lecture you, but I'm not surprised she didn't. There's a normal way of living together, you're incapable of doing it. Try to change somehow, try to live normally. Cleverly. Thoughtfully. Care about people, listen to their problems, and then things will be fine. Believe me, if you act differently to your mother, Believe me, if you act differently to your mother, show the least understanding, if you behaved ***as if she were your mother, tried to love her a little. Your mother is an exceptionally nice woman. It's impossible that she can be nice to all but not to her own son. Look for the fault in yourself. And don't whine that she won't give you money, why should she? For you to go to the pub and drink it? That's why she doesn't give you any. If she saw you needed it for something specific, to do something with yourself, she'd give you it for sure. That's all I can say, sorry... try to live normally, like an honest man. - You can talk, you swine! - You idiot, what do you want... - You can talk... - What's wrong? Are you mad? - You can talk! You shit! - You must be mad, don't start again! You're mad... Let go of me, you swine... You dirty sod. Me a sod, you idiot? I'm trying to make a normal man out of you! Give me the jewellery! - What jewellery? - Give me the jewellery! - What jewellery, you idiot? - I saw you take it. I didn't take any jewellery, I'm not a thief. Give me the jewellery! - I don't have any jewellery! - I saw you! - But I don't have any jewellery. I'll rip you apart! Look, I'm no thief and I haven't taken anything! Where is it? - I didn't steal it. - Where is it? - I needed money. - Where is it? I told you I needed money, I pawned it. I'll redeem it. It'll go back to your mother. - Where's the ticket? - All you can do is fight, all you want to do is kill! See why she won't give you money, you're over the top! Where's the ticket? - I dont have it. - Where is the ticket? - I don't have it. - Where's the ticket? I wanted to redeem it. Can't understand? Just... let me look at it? Where is it? Here, now look at it. I didn't steal it. I pawned it. I'll redeem it. ...and what I wanted to ask you last time too... how did you manage to live up to now? What luck did you have? How did you succeed? Up to now I've always thought this is a transition. And then comes life. But you can't always show it. But you can always wait. And then it really goes on. Then it's not so important. after a while... ...it just goes on. Sometimes a couple of pills helps... I thought you had a special trick. A trick? You see, I never though of that. Perhaps I have. You're not afraid of me? - Of you? Give me your hand. I'm not afraid of you. When I listen to those cleanest notes, I feel I'll beat someone to death in minutes. I feel it mostly then... That's being stupid. But I can't always bear it. Just half beat him up. If you want to fight someone. I won't any more, fighting... bores me. But I thought with this... other field, with the notes flashes block my eyes. ...so that I don't... ...maybe I can only trust my ears... There's an opera, Orpheo. It starts with Eurydice's death. Then Orpheus shouts out three times. - in words! Because he can't sing then. Because it hurts him too much. You're in the opposite situation. Do you think that way? - Putting an end to it all. - It ended a long time ago. ...would you think, if I grabbed your throat now that it would also me... Does it hurt you that much? Don't you see my face? Doesn't that give you anything? No? I know it does! Disgusting worm! Well, it'd be a great help... if you'd leave now... if you'd leave the room... I'm not leaving. I don't want to. Get out! I won't! Get out. Don't send me out. - Get out... - I won't... I love you... I said it because I love you. Fuck off. I won't get out. Easy... We're getting out... I'll take you away from here... With what? What's that? I'll sell it. I don't believe it... - I don't believe it... - What don't you believe? I don't believe it! I can't sleep. For a couple of days now. Can you? I don't know how to say it. so you don't get me wrong but when I saw Anna in J?nos's room, that's beside the point, and then he was showing her a piece of paper... and it was a pawn ticket... which Tibor... he stole from you a bracelet. H?di... who are we living with? What kind of people? Or are we alive, or what? Do you get it? I don't. I don't understand it. No. Where is this leading to? ... When you first step into school let the gentleness of Jesus cover your face. Call the children to you stroke their heads. If you see one in rags, sorrow written on its face feel pity for suffering starting so early clasp him to you and kiss him. Not interested at all? What? No. Absolutely not. I haven't been thinking of that I've been thinking J?nos really is a nice guy and no idiot. You think only an idiot would want to marry me? - At least. - Sorry? I said at the least! So why have you lived with me until now... You bastard! - Good question. - A question. So answer it! For this stinking room? For the money? - Well... - Come on! You're nowhere... just nowhere. I can't find the words to tell you. Where have I been till now? Till now I haven't been anywhere? Absolutely nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. So why were you here? It suited you to take advantage. I must have been somewhere or why were you here? If I was nowhere, then why aren't you on the streets? Why didn't you leave? Why didn't you rush off?! Why have you been sitting around here for two years? I've got a splitting headache. You'd better leave me. You're not sending me out of here again. I'll thump you so hard, you'll never have another headache. You stinking sod! And now I'm in command here and I'll say who's leaving and when and where. - I just asked. - I'm not alone. For your best sake I tell you I'm not alone. From here on you can't do whatever you want with me. If you don't want to fight? Just talk to H?di about that. I want to talk to you, rather I don't want to, I just tell you the facts and you get the hell out, I just tell you the facts and you get the hell out, especially after what I've just said. You pimp. I think I was accurate there, wasn't I? The last of the pimps. Somehow I always thought... All right... now you're pulling a face again but just don't you think, son, that you've won. I don't think anything. All right, I don't want to talk to you about anything. Especially after all this. After this, you get orders. I suggest that for your own sake you carry them out, for from tomorrow on, if I want, you're kicked out, got that? - My God! - All right? - It's flat. Just do what you're told. Don't touch me! - Stop this! - Just go, I'm asking you nicely! - I'm not going. - I don't want to shout. Just listen to me, calm down, pull yourself together, listen. - Get out of here! - I've been a good maid here and I will be too. You brought your lover here, then your second one, then the third. That's enough. Don't you go for my son! Out you go! I'm stronger than you, for God's sake. - That's what you think. - Just calm down! - Aren't you going? - Do you want to fight? I won't go! I'm no match for you! I don't want to fight for God's sake! - Then just go, that's all. - I'm not going! You're going, do you get it! You're going. No need for that. Whoring witch. Don't come near me. I'm telling you. nicely. Don't provoke me. There's a limit to everything. Don't provoke me! - Please talk to J?nos. - Me talk to J?nos? That would be best. All right, calm down. There were a couple of sluts they're gone and so are you. You can't offend me, no matter what you say. I'm not, it's you who said it. Nothing new in that. - Are you all right? - Nothing to do with you. Because if you're not, just say and I'll go. - Go, go. - Not now. I have a phone, I can call for help if I have to. - It's up to you. - But just go. Enough. Enough! - I'm not going. - Why not? - Becouse I want to live here. - Why, why more provocation? - I'm not being provocative. You think that I have to get out now. Yes. It's my home and I'm in charge here, see? OK, you're in charge here. Because the relationship we had is over. A new set up now, in case you don't know. - That's what I said too. - That's why you're leaving. So go like a good girl. - Are you starting again? - Don't touch that piano! - Stop, hell, stop it! You stop it! You stop it! What more do you want? Why don't you leave? Because I don't want to. But you will. - Stop it! - You're leaving here! You know? Because I'll kill you. Out! Or you want to kill me? You'll never succeed! Get out, you bitch! This is total madness... I never knew you were so strong. Not that strong, since I wasn't able to kick you out. And you won't set foot here again, even if you're a bit stronger than me... You won't succeed. No matter the violence. You stink! Oh God... - Impossible. - Why? I'm sure. - I think it's possible. - Everyone shapes peace and quiet to his own image and thinks it's good for him. There's only one peace. If there's two, then one of them isn't peace. Speaking about peace before, it was always about your peace. What I want to ask is Whether you see any chance, that here something can... Nothing. No chance here and there's no other chance. What would you do in my place? No advice? - You trust me? So you asked? - Yes. You don't need ideas. Don't need any advice. Still, I wondered if you had because I don't. Trust me. Trust me! And one thing's definite. Tibor's got to be reported to the police. For theft. It doesn't make sense for you to interfere in a marriage but I wouldn't give your son and his wife a penny. I'm interfering? In what? I'd just like to say... I'd just like to say... if you really trust me, just tell me everything. Your financial affairs... what and why you spend, how much and why you want to spend, and why want to give him money. That'll make it easier for you and it'll be a support. That you talk and give me advice on what to do. That's it. That's normal, isn't it? Yes. I think so too. Nervous? Yes. Yes. Thank you for your help... Yes... Look, who would think a man who seems to be a friend, an intellectual, a teacher, could do such thing. Well it's a surprise. If we lose our trust in everyone, then would it be a life any more? You can't live like that. Actually my son found out but he wanted to see the outcome, what'd happen so he found out about the pawnshop and the rest. He took the pawn ticket from him, so seeing him in the act and the proof that he pawned it under his own name. You can imagine! Look, besides your moral outrage, there's the value too. And the memories. And this is a piece I have cherished memories of and it's quite valuable too. It's gold, braided gold, there's one or two diamonds Handmade and beautiful. Yes. yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Well... Thank you very much, that's all I wanted to report. Me too. Goodbye. Thank you. I am guilty but I expected more understanding from them. Especially, I didn't think they'd give me away to you and try to ruin the good elationship between us. But that's what happened and that's why I'm sad. It was perhaps only you who's been patient with me from start to end. So now for all that's happened, I apologize Private affair. That's what they say. That's what they say to me. Solve it. Private affair. That's true, quite true. I always forget that. How you survive, it's private affair. No more. That's all. As Hamlet says "The rest is silence. " It's up to you. It's up to you. When my hair was long and brown, I asked my mother: Will I be happy, and sweet and she replied in tears: Be as humble as me, be satisfied my love. Fate has a thousand ways, and what will be will be. When my hair was long and brown I asked my mother: Will I be happy, and sweet and she replied in tears: Be as humble as me be satisfied my love. The future I can't see and what will be will be, whatever will be will be. On my very first date a fine young lad came up to me. Will you love me forever, I said to him, and this is what he lied to me: Whatever will be will be the future I can't see. Fate has a thousand ways and what will be will be, whatever will be will be. Two years we were happy then away he went so far. Will he be back or not, that's all his letters said: Whatever will be will be, the future I can't see. Fate has a thousand ways, and what will be will be, whatever will be will be. Now I've a child of my own brown is her hair and she's just my own, "Will I be happy?" and I smile in tears: Be as humble as me, be satisfied my love The future I can't see and what will be will be, and what will be will be, whatever will be will be.
