[Long ring] [heavy breathing] [engine starting] [engine revving] [explosion] [slow jazz music playing] [man coughing] My dear, sweet Elizia. I've loved you these many, many years. But I found something new, something greater than love. Who is she? There is no she, just an-- it, an-- it, a thing, a deepness that can only invade a soul and initiate a longing that fills the entire earth, up on earth to treasure deeper than gold, purpose farther than the Sun, a beautiful masterpiece inside of me. The local wizards have opened my inner cornea and unveiled my inner ear drum. Local wizards? Yeah, Alistair Newman say that I have radioed into the new world, the prime universe and they've protected me from the Lizard people. Lizard people? The Lizards, the Gray's, the Whites. Newman even gave me this. It protects me from the abductions and it makes me a receiver. To receive what? Messages from beyond. Does this mean we're broken up? [Messy jazz music playing] [phone ringing] [phone still ringing] Fred? Hello? Frederick, is that you? [Screeching tone] [Lilith banging door] Elizia! [Banging door] Elizia! Elizia, are you there? - [Elizia] Coming. - Hello! Coming. Elizia, what is going on in there? Nothing, nothing at all. Sounds like somebody's being murdered in there. Are you okay? Yeah I'm fine, everything's fine. Is there somebody in here with you? No, just me. Are you being held hostage? Blink twice if there's somebody in here with you. No I'm fine, everything's fine. Thank you. Well all right then. You know, if you need anything... Yep. Got it. Thank you. [Phone ringing] [phone still ringing] Hello? [Telemarketer] Would you like to win a free chance to take a trip of a lifetime? No. No. Thank you. [Telemarketer] Ma'am, are you all right? No. No, I'm not. [Telemarketer] Would you like to talk about it? I don't know. I don't know you. [Telemarketer] Sometimes all you need is a listening ear. That's part of a telemarketer's job. I don't even know where to begin. [Telemarketer] Start from the beginning, girl. Well, I met Fred about three years ago. He was a swell guy. He was the perfect guy. He would wrap me up at night and swaddle me like a child. We would go get ice cream and he would always wipe the drips from my chin. - We'd go to the movies and laugh at the same parts. - [Melancholic music playing] And then... [telemarketer] Then what happened? Then he became distant. [Telemarketer] Distant, how? He would go get eggs and be gone for hours. And he would-- started wearing gloves, buying lots of aluminum foil, eating kale, you know. It wasn't right. [Telemarketer] Then what? Then it was over. Just like that. He said he'd found enlightenment, a truer path, a gateway to the inner ear. [Telemarketer] And why couldn't you go down this path with him? He wouldn't let me. He said he had to do it alone. [Telemarketer] The true path is the singular path. What? [Telemarketer] Sometimes the only way to be at peace is to be alone. Look at it this way. Fred is giving you a gift, a chance to find peace within yourself, to find your own path. Yeah, maybe. I don't know, it still hurts a lot. Almost too much. I must sound like an idiot, blubbering on and on like this. [Telemarketer] Oh it's nothing, believe me. You hear all sorts of things in this line of work. Well, if it's all the same to you, thanks for listening to me. Anytime. You have a good night ma'am. You too. I'm Elizia, by the way. I didn't catch your name. [Telemarketer] You can just call me The Telemarketer. Well, good night, The Telemarketer. [Telemarketer] Good night, Elizia. [Phone calling] [voicemail] Hi, you've reached Elizia. I'm either not here or I don't care about answering the phone. Either way, save words after the beep-a-de-beep. [Long beep] Elizia, it's Dan. You missed two days of work in a row. You haven't called. Did no one get in touch with you? Look, if you're not at work on time tomorrow, then I'm gonna have to let you go. I'm sorry but I got a business to run. Uh, hopefully, you get this message. [Long beep] This one smells like bananas, you know, kind of like, it's been sitting out in the sun too long radiating by our mother-ship. [Sniffing] And this one, this one smells musky, kind of rotten, kind of like meat that's been sitting out too long. I don't know. I think my old Frankie will love them both. I just want this Valentine's Day to be amazing. What do you think? They both smell lovely. But you didn't even smell my wrist. I don't have to. Your beauty is worth more than a fragrance on an appendage and your love shouldn't be tied to extrasensory enhancements. If Frankie can't love you without a certain smell attachment, then you should seek a new relationship. Umm, okay. I guess I'll take the one that smells like bananas. Have a nice day and thank you for shopping at Fashion Style Mart Hut. [Door bells ringing] [soft store music playing] Hey Elizia. - [Glass breaking] - Oh shit! Um, I'm so sorry. I didn't-- Uh, I didn't mean to scare you like that. Listen, um I was just wondering if-- Look I know that Fred uh- Listen, what I'm trying to say is I know that Valentine's Day is coming up and I would hate for you to be alone and all... It's fine. Okay then. Well in that case, uh, if you care to join me for... I'm fine. Thank you for asking, but I'm fine. Okay then. Uh-- I yeah-- I was just-- in case you change your mind, you know where to find me. I guess. I guess. Okay then, um... It was good talking to you. [Giggling] Elizia, you've got to get a hold of yourself. You've got to move on. We all saw the writing on the wall. He was going nuts talking about aliens all the time, dolphins, one plus one is three, reading all kinds of pamphlets. Yeah, you know, he gave me that one book 101 Ways to Connect with the Dead. How to connect with your inner lizard? Weird shit man, yeah, you don't need that. Yeah, none of us needs that. Okay that's enough, guys. Let's hear from Ellie. Ellie, baby, how are you doing? What do you think? How am I doing? What do I think? You remember that magic trick, that great trick when we were kids? [Elizia] The top-hatted magician would set a table with wine, deserts, a roast duck in the middle, all shiny and fat. Then he would make his way to the end of the long table, grab the hem of that beautiful red tablecloth and tug so quickly and in such a way that all that delicious food and drink would stay in place, but the cloth underneath had vanished. That's what happens when a professional, someone suited for the job, performs that bit of prestidigitation but... [exhaling] ...when an amateur does it-- when Fred does it, the roast duck is on the ground, cake is smashed to bits and the wine bottle is shattered. He shattered me. - So, me and the girls have been talking. - Yeah. Yeah, we've been talking and we think that maybe it's time you get back out there again, you know, play the field a little. Valentine's Day is just around the corner and it's a good time to go fishing. Go fishing? [Beth] Why don't you just grab a newspaper, look through the classifieds, see if there's someone that you can tolerate. Could be interesting, right? I like books. I like numbers. Numbers? Yes, numbers are fascinating, prime, negative, odds, even, square-roots. Heck, without numbers we wouldn't have computers, cell phones, transistors, chips. It's all about technology, nano computers. Did you know that there are nanorobotics bees that can pollinate the earth just as well as real bees? Robotic bees? That's right, we're talking global proportions. Numbers turn into science and science turns everything into automation. Robots. Some day we will serve them. Serve who? The robots! And I'll be damned if I'm not first in line to be subservient to my higher intelligent Android robotic overlords. [Spacey music playing] Jazz, true jazz. You see, jazz is like life, unpredictable, out of the blue, sporadic. Then how do you deal with life, that is? You deal by dealing with what you're dealt. Let me lay this down. Say you're dealt the Sun, you dance in it. Say you're dealt with the fool, you chastise it. You're dealt the king of swords, you fight it. Say you're dealt death... What, what do you do? Well, you either re-deal or you embrace it. Either way, it's coming for us all in the end. Speaking of death, have you ever seen a man die? You know, in the movies when you strangle someone, it only takes some seconds to kill them. Seconds! Well it's not that simple. You see, you gotta squeeze real hard, so hard it hurts the hands, the eyes roll up and the throat gargles. It's hard, it's real horror. It changes a man. [Sipping] [dramatic music playing] [phone ringing] - Hello? - [Telemarketer] Hey, girl! Who is it? [Telemarketer] It's me. You know, from the other day. The Telemarketer? My friends call me Telly. I'm-- what-- What do you want? [Telemarketer] Oh nothing-- to see how you're feeling. You were pretty broken up the other day. - Uh... - [telemarketer] I'm concerned about you, Ellie. Please don't call me that. [Telemarketer] But that's short for Elizia, isn't it? That's what your friends would call you, wouldn't they? Aren't we friends? I feel like we're friends now. [Elizia] Please, please stop calling me. Don't, don't call me anymore. I don't know you. [Telemarketer] But you've always known me. [Water sprinkling] [distant barking] [man on TV] What's up with the farmer John who is milking the cows, you know? [Man 2] Hey I mean, praying is for church, huh? [Woman] I haven't seen you in church lately. [Man 2] Well, there's not much sense in my going to church. [Man 3] Are you hurt? Is the world letting you down? Is the trials and tribulations that you are feeling making a black void in your soul? I'm here to help you. There is somebody that can help which is the Lord. Do you feel let down? Are you terminally ill? Do you feel all is not right in your life? Maybe you're in a breakup. Has that person left you? Do you need help? Well I have the good news for you. Please lay your hands on the screen and touch mine through the power of the television. Do you feel the healing? Please touch my hands and listen to the Word of the Lord. [Chanting] [Elizia whispering] [man] Pray. Pray! Pray! [Man in deep voice] Elizia. Come forward, Elizia. Go forward, one foot in front of another until nothing is left but the light. [Double bass playing] [Elizia] Have you ever heard God speak? Like a real voice? Like a man's voice? Yes, an audible voice, a powerful assertion or insertion into your brain, into your inner ear. I don't believe that is a man. Then what is he? If it exists, it's um, cosmic force. I don't know Mary, you sound like Obi-Wan Kenobi. Guys, I heard God this morning. He, she, it whatever, God spoke to me, like, audibly spoke to me. [Mary] Oh come on! Ellie, what did God say? The voice said, "Keep moving forward. One foot in front of the other until nothing is left but light." So what drugs are you taking? Because I want some. Seriously though, Ellie, you're starting to scare us. What do you mean? You haven't been going out lately. You've been keeping to yourself. You're totally wasted over Fred. [Beth] You're crying all the time. [Mary] And now what, you're receiving messages? [Elizia] I'm receiving messages from the beyond. You know, something has got to change. How, Beth? How? Because I don't see any changes in my future. [Mary] Change with time is inevitable. That is a guarantee. [Double bass continues playing] Do you have any other scents? Scents? Yes, other scents besides bananas and musk. We have a variety of scents here at Fashion Style Mart Hut. Something more with celery or parsnip or ginger. Do you have something like that? You may want to try the beauty barn located at 5th and Elm Street. Thank you for shopping at Fashion Style Mart Hut. Hey Ellie! Uh, listen um-- lunch break is coming up and I know this great spot that's right around the corner it's... I'm not hungry. - Well, everybody's gotta eat. - I'm fasting. For what? Wait, like-- like, uh... Is it a religious thing? Because if so that's cool. Maybe, I don't know. Okay. Uh, well, some other time then? Maybe some other time. [Distant barking] [Fred] --my inner ear drum. [Phone ringing] Bananas and musk? Do you need help? Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! [Blabbering] [growling] Who's there? [Distorted voices] Join us. Shit! Shit! Join us! No. Please. Please, just leave me alone. Go away! Go away! Go away! [Phone ringing] - Hello? - [Telemarketer] Hello, friend. I haven't heard from you in a bit. Why are you still calling me? [Telemarketer] Because, Elizia, we are one and the same. We are destined. Destined for what? [Telemarketer] To be together forever. [Giggling] You can never leave, you can never leave us. - [Phone ringing] - [screaming] [knocking on the door] Who is it? Your neighbor, Lilith. I-- um, is there anything I can help you with? Well, actually I made far too many brownies for my church's bake sale and I thought you might want some. Oh no, Snickers, these are not for you. [Giggling] ah. Chocolate will kill you. Yeah. Uh, thank you, I really appreciate it. Um, I'll bring the plate back when I'm done with it. Yeah, that reminds me. I've been hearing a lot of strange noises lately. [Exhaling] I'm concerned about the safety of my neighbors, you know. You know, love thy neighbor and all. What sort of voices-- um noises, have you been hearing exactly? Well, you know, the occasional plate breaking, heavy sobbing, banging on the walls, the kind of stuff that, you know, you call the police for. Yeah, before you know it, there's three dead bodies stuffed on a steamer trunk and then all the neighbors are being interviewed on unsolved mysteries. There is really no reason to look behind every door and underneath every table. I promise you there is nothing weird going on in my apartment. Well, you can never be too safe. Yes. Well, I appreciate you being so concerned about my safety and well-being. I really appreciate it. - Well that is why I'm here. Now if you need anything... - Mm-hmm. - Yes, absolutely. - Anything at all... I know where you live. We are next-door neighbors. Thank you. [Exhaling] Damn it. Sorry, here's Snickers. Again, thank you so much for the brownies. [Exhaling] [sound of the sea rolling] [Elizia] Ah... Well, Miss Cummings, everything looks good there. It's Elizia. Yes. Well, Miss Cummings, let's see what else we've done. Blood pressure looks fine. No irregular heartbeat. Eyes, ears, nose and throat all look wonderful. You're in great physical condition. Then how do you explain the voices, the hallucinations, the blood in my ear? Well, I mean, I can schedule to run some CAT scans, brain scans and a whole host of other tests and pokes and prods but now I've seen similar cases to this and my gut's telling me they'll all come back as clean as a whistle. No. No, there's something deeper going on here. I would like to try something. Is that okay? - Sure, anything. - Okay. I'd like to try and hypnotize you. Hypnotize me? Yes don't worry. I practice alternative forms of medicine from time to time. Do you know the story of Little Red Riding Hood? Yeah, who doesn't? Well, sometimes, we have to remove the grandmother's skin to find the wolf beneath it. What I'd like to do is crawl just under the meat of the problem, to shed the skin, to find the root of this phenomenon. Would that be okay? At this point, I'll try anything. Okay, well I need you to look into my eyes and pick your hands up like you are surrendering. Good, good. Now stare deep into my eyes like you're trying to look to the back of my skull. Good. [Doctor whispering] Now focus and let go at the same time. [Clock ticking slowly] Now tell me, what do you see? [Elizia] I see men. [Doctor] What kind of men? Men controlling me, harming me. And how do you feel? I'm broken, ashamed, controlled. [Doctor] What do you see? [Elizia] I'm face down in a field, men in hazmat suits scanning me, judging me. But... - But... - [doctor echoing] What? What is it? What is it? [Elizia sobbing] Everything is beautiful. Everything is white. [Doctor] What do you see? [Elizia] God. I see God. - [Clearing her throat] - What is it? What did I say? Um, I think you are much better off to see a specialist. This is more on the plane of para-spiritual than it is physiological. [Clearing her throat] I'd like you to go see a trusted friend and advisor, Dr. Flemming. What does he do? He's a homeopathic holistic para-psychiatrist. And he can help me? Trust me. Trust me, my dear. [Soft music playing] Um, hi. Can I help you? Why do you keep the crust on your sandwich? Because it's wasteful to throw away the crust. You don't have to throw it away, silly. Feed it to the pigeons. I used to eat it without the crust. I know. [Both] It just tastes better that way. Don't grow up, throw away the crust, feed the pigeons. Do as I do. Be a fool, be a child. We are all just children even after we die. [Soft music continues] [soft jazz music playing] [Dr. Flemming] Tell me, what seems to be the problem? [Elizia] Everything. Even more than that. Where do you want me to start? From the beginning, Miss Cummings. It's Elizia. From the beginning, Miss Cummings. Well, things went crazy after Fred left. [Dr. Flemming] Your boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend, I guess. It still feels-- just saying that-- He started ranting about lizards and plants and secret technology and he had this tattoo on his hand that I'd never seen before. What kind of tattoo? It was an ear. [Dr. Flemming] Go on. Anyway, after that I started hearing things, I'm hallucinating. What do you see? What do you hear? Everything. God, the devil, heaven, hell, like the guts of the world have been pulled inside out and I can see all of its organs. My friends think I'm crazy. They say I just need to get back out there and start dating again but all I can find are guys who are crazier than I am. I'm spinning and spinning and I just need to pedal the other way. I see. Do you have a paddle, doctor? Well, this proverbial turning the tide of your whirlpool definitely won't be an instant fix. More of a gradual change. There's no magical bean or bullet or a pill that you can just swallow for this one. You see life is like exercise. In order to stay fit and healthy you have to diet and work out and change will come in time, gradually massaging the problems and curbing the waters. But there's always that first step. So what's mine? What's my first step? Refocus. You must refocus your energy from Fred. Put it on something else. Like what? It's up to you. It could be a hobby, bird-watching, fish-watching. It could be a thing. Do you like collecting? Do you collect anything, Miss Cummings? I don't know. What do people collect? Anything; coins, stamps, comics, cars, knick-knacks, gnomes. Gnomes? Yes, gnomes. Gnomes. [Dr. Flemming] Find something. Focus on it. Something that calls to you. That's your first step. Gnomes. [Whispering] [heavenly singing] [soft jazz music playing] I'm broken. How do you mean? I mean I've tried everything: dating, hypnosis, doctors, psychotherapy. Nothing's working. I'm broken, unfixable. Oh Humpty Dumpty fell off her wall? Look Ellie, I just think you're letting this breakup get the best of you. You don't understand. Something was planted in my brain that keeps growing and growing until one day my head is going to explode. Oh brother! [Elizia] Do you know the Church of the Transfiguration? No. There's this old church on St. August Street downtown. It's been calling me. Calling you? Yes. It has a glowing door that keeps whispering my name. I've been going there a lot at night just standing there, listening. You need some serious help. You know that, right? I know, that's what I'm saying. I'm hearing these things, I'm seeing these things and nothing is working. I'm broken. Beth, maybe we should... I don't know. Maybe what? Well, remember when me and Beth lost pops? [Elizia] Yeah, you guys were really broken up about it. Yeah I OD'ed, almost died. It was some scary shit. Feels like forever ago. Five years ago. Well, we ran off to Nevada... That healing retreat. Oh yeah, you guys came back like new. Do you think I should do that? Mm, it really was a bunch of bullshit. Ten thousand dollars worth. There's no way you could afford that. Not without rich parents, right Davey? Anyway, they did give us one thing. - One thing. - One thing? One thing that flipped the switch. Turned the dial. Turned on the light and we were out of the darkness. So what was it? A secret, a word, a meditation? Yahey. Yahey? Ayahuasca. I'm confused. Hallucinogenics, they tripped balls. Come on you guys, I need to be healed, not more fucked up. [Dave] I'm serious Ellie, it really opened some doors for us. [Beth] It's at least worth a try. What the hell? I have nothing to lose. Atta girl. Okay, here, you're gonna take this and you're gonna drink just a little-- Okay. Right, now just lay back and keep your eyes open. You're just gonna try to clear your mind. [Distant growling, whispering and blabbing] [phone ringing] [heart beating] [distant bells ringing] [screaming] [distant talking] [Dave] It's okay, you're all right. [Beth] You'll be okay. [Dave] You're all right, we're here. Oh Ellie. Okay. Breathe. [Narrator] Notice how the caterpillars are the very picture of concentration. Their focus is absolute, rendering them completely oblivious to any danger, any lurking predator to anything outside the world of this leaf. Eating is all there is. [Knocking on the door] [exhaling] Not a good time. Leave me alone. [Silly voice] Hey, down here. It's me Snickers. Oh no, no, no. [Snickers] It's cool, we just need to talk. You need to leave. Oh no, no, that's not gonna happen. We need to talk. No, you need to leave, you need to leave, you need to leave, right now. [Snickers] We absolutely need to talk. Let me ask you, why Elizia? Why what? [Snickers] Why are you so mad at me? Mad at you? Yes, and you've been speaking the secret language. Secret language? For the world. The secret language of the heavenlies. Oh no, I only speak English. I'm not a resident of another plane or planet and you, you heard wrong and you need-- I need you to go. What you got there? - This? - Mom's brownies? [Lilith's voice] Chocolate will kill you. Do you want some? [Snickers] Yes, yes, yes, yes. Mom never lets me have any. Eat up. Argh! Yes, thank you, thank you, thank you. [Phone calling] [Elizia's mom] Hello? Ellie? Baby, is that you? [Elizia] Mom, can I come home? [Elizia's mom] Of course, dear. Honey, what's wrong? Why did you come home? Nothing. No reason. I'm fine. But honey, you were crying, sobbing last night. On the phone, you were sobbing. Mom, can't I just come home and see my mom every now and then? I don't know, I had to get away for a bit. Well, honey, I know. Sunday is tomorrow, we'll go to church, see Pastor Hanley speak. Sure mom, that sounds great. [Elizia's mom] I set up your old room for you to sleep. It looks like you could use some rest. Do you know the healing capabilities of crystals? The sacred bonds of wolf and man? The pure energy of light and the laying on of hands? There are forces beyond our control! Forces that have controlled our way of life! They're seeding the clouds with false memories. We are already dead, people, and the rain has washed away all memory of our passing. Open your eyes, open your hearts! Rip open the veil and peer into your new world. You're new world, the real world! So how was it, at your mom's? I don't know. Weird. Things are weird no matter where I go. Sorry, Elle. I just-- I don't know what to do anymore. There are motivational speakers. They help people. Tony Robbins, Richard Simmons; people like that. Dave, do you think the government is seeding the clouds with weird chemicals? What? Never mind. Wait, what's going on, Elle? I think there's someone following us. Really? - I don't see anyone. - Don't stop. Come on. What? Ellie-- Elle, are you alright? This is maybe too traumatic for you right now. We should just go. No. No. These are not traumatic tears, these are beautiful tears. Everything is beautiful. Okay. [Soft music playing] [Dr. Flemming's voice] Must refocus your energy on Fred, put it on something else. Gnomes. [Elizia] Gnomes. [Dr. Flemming's voice] Find something. Focus on that. That's your first step. [Heavy breathing] [jazz music playing] I'm really worried about Ellie. How do you mean? I mean she's gone into space. I know, she's still all broken up over Fred. I mean she's broken up, broken down, broken apart. Breakups are hard sometimes. She asked me about the government seeding the clouds. She thinks she's being followed and she cried tears of joy during a horror movie. She's flipped upside down, Mary. Maybe we should just stop meddling, just let this pass. She'll normalize from crazy, to angry, to depose to depressed, to okay, to fine, to better. It's a cycle, it's chemistry. Yeah, I just wish we could help her. Speaking of Ellie, guess who just showed up and wants to help you blow out the birthday candles. Also she's drunk as shit. [Exhaling] [ambient music playing] Davey, it's the birthday boy! Ellie, what the hell are you doing? I wanted to give you your present. What would that be? It's me! Unwrap me, silly. Ellie, you're drunk. I don't think you know what you're doing. Oh, shut up and dance with me, stupid. Come on. Don't. You don't tell me what to do. ♪ Nany Nany boo boo stick your head in poo poo ♪ Come on, let's just sit down and relax. I have to pee, where's the bathroom? Okay. See, see the hallway? Yeah, go straight back. You can't miss it. All right. [Music distorting] Excuse me. Do you know where the bathroom is? Hello? Hey! Do you know where the bathroom is? Excuse me. Who are you? What's going on? What do you want from me? [Crying] Please, this is not what I go through. I'm not finished yet. This is not the veil. No, this is not veil. Please. Please. I just want to go back to the party. I just want to see Dave and Mary and Beth and even Cleve sometimes. No! Please, this is not where I go through. This is not the veil. This is not the veil! Ellie, Ellie, get it together. Come on. You got to calm down. The neighbors have called the cops. Ellie, I need you to breathe. Breathe. It's okay. [Dave] I'm gonna get you a cab home, okay? [Voice] Hey! Hey, Ellie! Who's there? It's me, over here on the shelf. Mr. Stuffybottoms? Listen, you can't listen to those whispers you're hearing. You can't let the control room control you. Excuse me, gnomes don't talk. We most certainly do and I don't have the time to argue with you. Oh no, you're a possessed doll, hell no. Possessed is such a derogatory term. I'm only a vessel. Mm. No, hell no. You need to go. Wait, we need to talk. I do have a message, if you'd only listen. Wait! [Lilith] Snickers! Here Snick, Snick, Snick. Little Snicky doodles. Snickers, where are you? Oh, oh Ellie! Have you seen my Snickers? I let him out a couple days ago to do his business and he hasn't been home since and I'm so very, very, worried about him. Uh who? Snickers. My dog. Have you seen him? I am not available for questioning. Bye. Have a good one. [Soft piano playing] [music gets quicker] [music gets very fast] Um, I think you need to get out. [Elizia] No! No! Please! No! [Crying] No. No. And there he was, Mr. Stuffybottoms, up on the bookshelf, like nothing had ever happened. [Dr. Flemming] Mr. Stuffybottoms? [Elizia] Yes, my gnome. I mean, that's what I named the gnome. He's not mine anymore. I-- He won't leave and I just want to get rid of him or it or whatever it is. And you say he spoke to you. Yes, he said, "You can't let the control room control you." First of all, he did not speak to you. This whole psychosis is in your ear or your mind. It's the inner workings being revealed to you. I don't care what you think you heard that gnome saying. It's just you speaking to your own real self. And I think that in order for you to heal and to move over that bridge, you just might have to let that gnome speak. I don't think I'm going back to that Dr. Flemming. What? Why? I thought he was helping you. I have a creature living in my house speaking gibberish first of all but trying to communicate something. I don't know. A creature? You mean like a mouse? Like a talking mouse? No. A gnome. A gnome? Oh, like from the Thrift Store. Is this gnome like jumping up and down and moving its lips? He's not physically speaking, like, psychically or tele-- what's the word for brain thought talking? Telepathically. Yes. Whatever. I'm so tired. I'm not even upset about Fred anymore. I feel like I'm not even alive, like I have a foot in another dimension. I've been reading a lot about this and what you're experiencing is called supernatural personification. What? Supernatural personification, it's when something or someone enters an inanimate object so that way you can communicate with the living. You know, like the Djinn. Djinn? Genies, they're tricksters. You know, this thing is really evil and you've got to get rid of it. But I've tried. That's what I'm saying. I've thrown it away numerous times, but Mr. Stuffybottoms always ends up back on the shelf, tormenting me. Here. Take this. [Elizia] What's this? [Beth] Someone who can help. [Cell phone vibrating] One second. - Hello? - [Telemarketer] Ellie? Is it you? Yeah it's me, Telemarketer. How'd you get my cell phone number? I just need to hear your voice. I'm worried about you. You haven't returned my calls. I asked you to stop calling me. And what about Stuffybottoms? - Excuse me? - Do you want to get rid of all of us? Don't ever call back. Goodbye. I need to see this Dante right away. [Dante] Well, I gotta say, this is classic Djinn. They're tricksters and they're always looking for a new vessel, someone to steal and create a new realm inside of. A realm? A universe within a universe within a universe. It's where they thrive. An evil wheel within a wheel, so to speak. What do I do? Well, first of all, we're going to do a little test. A test? Don't worry, no pins or pricks or needles. A simple vision test, if you will. Now open the book and tell me what you see. Not exactly what you see but how you feel. Um... Pain. Love. Anger. Loss. Evil. Deception. [Dante] Yes. Good. Good? Means you haven't gone too far. You, Miss Cummings, are still with us. We may be able to get rid of these invaders. Here. Drink this. When you get home, stand in front of the gnome, drink this, then dance wildly. [Dante] Burn the gnome outside in a fire and repeat these words, "avid-mal-um, avid-mal-um". Repeat those words while the fire is burning and that's it. [Elizia] That's it? [Dante] That's it. It'll never come back into your house again. Wow. Elizia, you seem like you're doing so much better now. Seems like you're finally past all this, huh? Yeah. I guess I am. I guess I am. [Upbeat music playing] [John] Dear Elizia, I know that we just work together, but I really dig you. I think that you're a swell chick that deserves better than that what Fred ever handed you. Anyway, Valentine's Day is tomorrow and if you're free then I'd love to take you out. Let me know. Hugs and kisses, John from work. [John] Hello? Hi, John. Ellie? I would love to go out with you tomorrow night. Wow! Well great! Um, Alfonso's Cafe at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow okay with you? Sounds fantastic. So, I tell Mr. Kerbumple he can shove it up his backside. I'm a stock boy not a janitor. And he still hasn't fired you? No, no. I'm a friend of the family, I guess. Lucky you. One more customer complaint and I'll probably be getting the shaft. You don't need this job anyway. You're not like normal people. Oh. What, so I'm weird? No, no, no, not at all. No, you're-- uh, you're not meant for this sheep-herding world. No, what I mean to say is you're better than this world. You're meant for better things. There's a sparkle, a twinkle behind your eyes that most people don't have. There's a destiny under your skin. No, no, I'm-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean-- Did I upset you? No, that was beautiful. What you said was really beautiful. No one's ever spoken to me that way before. Do you really believe that? With all my heart. Elizia! Elizia, you come answer this door this instant! Snickers is missing and I think you have something to do with it. Listen John, um, I'm sorry I've been ignoring you. It's just things have been really hard and honestly really weird lately. That's what breakups do, especially, you know, when someone you love doesn't love you back. It's like-- Losing an appendage. Yeah. Yes, it's like someone cut off your arm and its gushing blood and nobody can see it but you. Sounds like you've been through it before. Who was she? My mom. She said, "Stay here. I'll be right back." I was seven. It was aisle three of the Piggly Wiggly. Never saw her again. I'm, I'm so sorry. That's okay. The pain never really leaves you though. Then how do you deal with it? You know, in school when you see those safety films? You know the safety films that teach you what not to do, like, don't stick a fork in the light socket, don't stick your hand in the fire, don't drink and drive. Sure. Well, when someone hurts you like that, it's kind of like a lesson, uh, like a safety film for your life. I learned what not to do. Because of her I'm a better person. Because of her I will never leave the one that I love. I guess that's the strength that comes out of the adversity that's placed upon us. That's beautiful. Elizia, you come and answer this door now! Hello? Hello. Oh, something stinks terribly! Ugh. What is that smell? Ugh. Oh, my God. Ugh! Ugh! That smell, what is that? Oh God, no! Snickers! [Cell phone vibrating] Excuse me just one moment. I told you to stop calling me and I would appreciate it if... [telemarketer] Shut up right now and listen. If you want to stay alive then you'll do exactly as I say. I see you and I see John. If you say another word, then you're both dead meat, you got that? What do you want? Good. Go to the back of the restaurant and go through the kitchen door. Okay, now what? See that sign on the door? Go there. I got you a little Valentine's gift. Go ahead, unwrap your present. [Laughing] Oh my God! What have you done? What did you do? [Telemarketer] I'm erasing the competition. Did you really think that your little showman ritual can get rid of us? A potion and a dance in a fire? We're here to take you over. We are here to become you, Elizia. If we can't have you then no one can. - Oh my God, John. What did you do with John? - [Laughing] Oh, sweet little Miss Cummings. [Laughing] Oh my God. John. [Telemarketer] See you soon, girl! We're coming. I've gotta get to my friends. [Operator] 911, what's your emergency? There's crazy man who's stalking me and I'm-- [operator] Ma'am. Hello? Ma'am, are you there? [Distant voices] What's happening? Where am I? What's going on? Someone... You really need to shut up back there. He's gonna have you, no matter how much commotion you make. Who's gonna have me? Who are you working for? What's going on? The Telemarketer, of course. Hasn't he been talking to you? He's got a big surprise in store for you. [Laughing] Damn it! All right, little girl, we've run out of gas. If you move even one little pinkie toe trying to escape, you're dead. Am I dead? You're in the in-between space. You're inside the walls of existence. Now is the moment for you to be free. How do I be free? Tell me, what do I do? Relax, open your ears, turn off your mind, and just simply listen. ♪ Elizia, can you hear me? ♪ Cos I'm calling out to you ♪ Elizia, can you hear me? ♪ Cos I'm calling out to you ♪ Daughter of the rain ♪ Daughter of the waves ♪ Daughter of the flames ♪ Come home, come home [upbeat music] Dr. Flemming, Dr Flemming, there's a crazy man after me. And he kidnapped me and I escaped and ran here. I'm having crazy visions. I've seen God and hell and heaven and my baby. He's coming. Relax! What would you like for me to do about it? I need your help! Well, I offered you an alternative and you refused. Where did you get that? [Gnome] I told you not to trust the collector to get the job done. That man has no eyes. Shut up, Wintel! Wait, what? Ellie dear, I wish you would've just listened to us. You could have joined us peacefully but now I believe we might just have to take some extreme measures. Take my hand, girl. Join us, don't go to the light. It scatters. We are to integrate, become one with you. Please, be with us, girl. No, please. Leave me alone. Take my hand, girl. There's nowhere to run. We're coming for you. We're coming. [Fast music] Hello. Hello! Hey! Someone help me, please. Please, somebody help me. There's a crazy man, he's following me around and a talking gnome. Hello! Hello, can any of you see me? Why aren't you saying anything? Please help me. Please. Please. Please someone help me. Please! Please! [Phone calling] What's happening? Is she answering? She's not picking up and I've left like five messages. Where do you think she is? Do you think she's in trouble? David, I'm really worried. Let's just go by her apartment and see, okay? [Soft piano music playing] Hey! Hey! Wait for me. [Girl's voice] Do as I do. [Dave] Hello? Ellie? [Beth] You there? Oh. [Lilith sobbing] She murdered my Snickers. She's a monster. I hope she rots in hell. [Crying] Oh my God! - Oh my God! - We gotta go find Ellie. [Piano music continues] Where are we going, folks? Shit, where are we going? Where would Ellie go? The coffee house, um, the bar. Meter's running, folks. Please just please give us one second. Uh, nope. Ellie's been going crazy places lately. Where would crazy Ellie go? She's been talking about that church. The church with the glowing door. Um. The Church of Annunciation...? Church of Transformation? Church of the Transfiguration? Yes, that's it. That church burned down, like, 25 years ago. It's an old convent. It got hit by lightning during a thunderstorm and burned to the ground. It was in all the papers. You know what? Actually one of the nuns got trapped in the bell tower and burned alive. All they found was a charred skeleton of Sister Cummings. Sister Cummings? Yeah Sister Cummings, that was her name. She died in that fire and they never rebuilt that church. It's just a playground now and basically an empty field. Sister Cummings. What was her first name? Uh this is a really long time ago guys, uh... I think her name started with an E. Eliza maybe. Was it Elizia? That's it. Sister Elizia Cummings. Have you guys heard of her? Was she your relative or something? She was our best friend. [Heavenly singing] [man] Elizia. Go forward, Elizia. Go forward. One foot in front of another until nothing is left but light.
