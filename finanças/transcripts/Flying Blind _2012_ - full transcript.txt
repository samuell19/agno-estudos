[soft dramatic music] [plane engines humming] [digital beeping] [digital beeping] [door shuts] [digital beeping] [door shuts] [machine humming] [wind howling] - [Soldier] So, we think vortex generators should do should do the job. - Well, the quickest and the cheapest option would be yes, to add some modified vortex vortex generators, or even sub boundary layer VGs, but... - But? - An optimization would still be severely severely limited, particularly for long endurance or below speed operations. - [Soldier] So what would you recommend? - Boundary layer suction. - But this is an existing UAV. The wing space is already utilized. - Yes, I know. But if I can move the transition to turbulence further along the wing, I can reduce the drag and more than offset the AUM. Alternatively, you could rethink the increase in payload. Does the drone need both bombs as well as missiles? - The Americans have both on the Reaper. - So, if the drone is to have both-- - Drone is a media term. We prefer to use remotely piloted air systems. - If you want more than a second-rate alteration, if you actually want to solve the problem, this is the way you will have to go, boundary layer suction. - We need the redesign spec by the end of the year. - You have eight weeks. - Eight weeks? - Not a problem, gentlemen. - I'm part of the team too, remember? - Sorry. It's when they look at me like that, it gives my adrenaline a kick. - Ya, well good for you. - We made the last deadline, we'll make this one. - But eight weeks? - Did we have a choice? - Well, I'd say there's room to wiggle. - I don't wiggle. Especially not for them. [Robert laughs] Any more questions? - If you're going to work in aerospace, it seems you can't escape from the military. I was wondering if that bothers you, ethically speaking? - No, not at all, none of us are outside the military industrial complex, that is, unless you don't use the internet. The internet is as much a part of military R&D as it is a promoter of knowledge. - It also promotes porn. What do you think about porn, Dr. Lethbridge? - Well, I don't know if all this talk of suction and drag has overstimulated your adolescent brain, [students laugh] but to get back to your question of ethics, yes, any aircraft can be adapted for military purposes, but, I, I, I don't know; I'm not a philosopher. I'm more interested in the beauty of flight rather than our ability to fight. [students chattering] [door closes] [keys jingling] [phone beeps] Hi, Robert. I'm gonna be here till about two, so wait with the aerofoil tests till I'm back. Thank you. [birds chirping] - Do you need some help? - Oh, no thanks. Being a twit, lost my keys. - Do you want me to break into the car? - Are you serious? - [laughs] No. - My dad's got a spare set. Be here in a minute. - By the way, it was a good lecture. Inspiring. - Thank you. - Really. - That edition's out of date. - Oh. Bye. [people chattering] [phone ringing] - Hello? - [Frankie] Alex, I've got the new data. - And you want me to put it in now? - [Frankie] Please. - Great. - Thank you. Thank you. [phone ringing] - Frankie, do you want to grab a drink? Frankie? - Hmm? - [Robert] Fancy a drink, on the way home? - Oh, um, no, thanks. I can't. - Right. You meeting what's his name? - No. What's his name and I finished a couple of weeks ago. He cried and said thank you after sex. - I'll make a note. [footsteps padding away] [seagulls cawing] [footsteps pounding] [Frankie panting] [digital beeping] - [Kahil] Hello. - What a coincidence. - Ya. [laughs] It's nice to meet you again. - Ya. As long as you're not stalking me. [Kahil laughs] [digital beeping] - [Kahil] Excuse me. Excuse me! You forgot your money. - Oh, my god. Thank you. [laughs] Well, you must think I've got my head in the clouds. - Aeronaut, it's your job. [Frankie laughs] - Did you get that new book? The new edition. - No, no, no. It's a little expensive. - Well, I could lend you a copy. Give you a lift? I'm just around the corner. - No, thanks. That's too much trouble. - Okay. [door shuts] [car engine starts] - Okay, I accept. [birds chirping] [car doors closing] - Oh, um, I'll just be a minute. - Okay. [keys jingling] [door closes] [birds chirping] [traffic humming] Thanks. This is very kind of you. - [Frankie] Oh, god, it's nothing. We got sent them for free. - I will buy you dinner, to thank you. [birds cawing] [slow soft music] [Kahil laughs] You okay? [laughs] The turkey says, "You got any bread?" The barman says, "Look, if you ask me again, "I'm gonna nail your beak to the bar. "Understood?" The turkey says, "You got any nails?" The barman shouts, "No!" The turkey says, "You got any bread?" [Frankie laughs] [music drowns out dialog] [keys clink] [traffic humming] - Do you want a drink? Glass of wine? - No, thanks. I don't drink. - [laughs] You're not a recovering alcoholic, are you? - Ya. - Shit. [Kahil laughs] - No, I'm Muslim. - I'm sorry. - What? [laughs] I mean about the drink. - It's okay, you didn't know. Also, I'm a poor engineering student. That you do know, not very exotic. - Well, I don't see you as exotic. - [Kahil] You don't? - Not in the slightest. - I can belly dance. Would you like to see? - No. [both laughing] - Where do you live? - Easton. Under a motorway. We've got Bristol City flags instead of curtains. [both laugh] And, where are you from? - [Frankie] What? [Kahil laughs] - Where are you from? - Lived in Bristol all my life. Say something to me in Arabic. - Say something to me in Bristol English first. - Take your shirt off. [speaks foreign language] Which means? Is there anything you just said that would stop me from kissing you? [Kahil sighs] Be back in a minute. [water splashing] [door shuts] [footsteps departing] [door closes] [people chattering] - Hello, yes, what can I do for you? - Excuse me. Can you tell me what this says? - Let me have a look. It sounds a bit romantic. And complicated. [speaks foreign language] - Do you know what it means? - It's classic Arabic poetry. - [Filali] The hero is weeping. - No, no, his wings are broken. See here. - Ah, he lost everything. - Where'd it say wings? - A sandstorm destroyed his tent and his wings. - [Abed] That doesn't make sense. - The sandstorm is in the shape of a woman; it refers to this woman. - She destroyed the weeping man's tent. Let's see if it's right. - Go ahead. - I cry, remembering my home and my lover. Like a storms, she broke my wings. - [Filali] Ya, makes sense. That's good. Good translation. - What it means is damn baby, you're too much for me. [all laughing] - That's what it meant. [laughs] [soft intense music] [traffic humming] [speaking foreign language] - Can I help you? - Hi. Is Kahil in? - You the police? - No. - Second door on the left. It's open. [speaks foreign language] - Kahil? It's Frankie. [dog distantly barking] [both heavily breathing] [traffic humming] [car alarm blaring] What happened? Sorry, I didn't mean to pry. - It's fine. - How old are you, Kahil? - [Kahil] 24. - You're not gonna tell the other students you had a visiting lecturer, are you? - I wouldn't do that. [laughs] Unless you refuse to see me again. [laughs] - Are you serious? - Ya. - [Frankie] Well that sounds like blackmail to me. - Ya. It is. I'll walk you home. - Hey, Kahil. [speaks foreign language] Oh. Hi. - Hi. Come watch the game. It's halftime, 3-2. - Oh. No, I've got a lot of work to do. I should probably get back. - Work? Come on, it's weekend. - Kahil will play, you can cheer him on. He doesn't play very well, he needs the encouragement. - You want to come? - Ya, do you want me to come? - I want you to come if you want to come. [people chattering] [men cheering] - Stop showing off, habibi. So, you're a professor, right? - No, I just give lectures now and then at the university. - Aeronautics. - And you? - Me? Well, this, that, and the other. [men cheering] - Keeping it vague. - Mysterious. I prefer mysterious. - [Man] Break his legs, man. - Hey, hey! [whistles] [men shouting] [Malik whistles] [whistle blows] [men cheering] [birds chirping] [car blinker clicking] [sighs] [keys jingle] - So, I had a good time. - Ya? - Ya. - Good. - See you soon. - Bye. [door closes] [birds chirping] [phone ringing] - Shit. Dad, I'm so sorry, I completely forgot. Please tell me you're not up there still waiting. Are you? - No, no. Don't worry about it. We can do it another day. You sound tired. - Ya, I've been working all day. Just got caught up in it. You know how it is. You at home now? - Yes, yes. Just watching the tele. - [Frankie] Good. Okay, I love you, Dad. I want to get in the shower now. Bye. [dial tone buzzing] [sighs] - [Robert] Okay, well, let's go back to the structural weight savings. I mean, we could switch to high modulus prepeg tape, we could alter steel hard points to cold forged titanium. And we could consider. Frankie? Frankie, what's wrong? - I met someone. - Oh. Well, that's um, that's great, isn't it? - I think so. - What's he do? - He's an engineer ing student. - What? [laughs] Aye. [clears throat] Well, if he has any thoughts on how to improve the flight envelope on this project, then... [Frankie laughing] [slow soft music] - Is this okay? - Ya. - Really? - Mm hm. - [Kahil] Great. - [Frankie] I've never had one of those before. - Shisha? - Mm hm. - You want to try it. - Ya. - Okay. Hello. Please. Could you bring us a shisha pipe? - Of course. [speaking foreign language] - Thank you. [diners chattering] You should try this one. This is really good. - Ah, is this like a tomato soup? - [Kahil] Ya. Try it. - [Dima] You both will be using it? - Yup. - Mm hm. [speaking foreign language] [water pouring] [pipe bubbling] [speaks foreign language] - Enjoy. - Thank you. Taste it. [Frankie exhales] [thunder rolling] - What were you talking about with the waitress tonight? - Well, I don't remember. I didn't know she was working there. - Who's she? - Well, she used to be my girlfriend. In Algeria. [Frankie shivering] Are you jealous? - Fuck you. [both heavily breathing] - Yes. You are jealous. - I'm never fucking jealous. - Really? - Why do I want you so much? - Because I want you only. - Say it again. [Frankie panting] [rain splattering] [Frankie panting] [phone buzzing] - Could you pass me the phone? Thank you. [speaks foreign language] [Kahil laughs] Sorry. It was my Egyptian nagging wife. [Frankie laughing] [laughs] It was Malik. - He's not Algerian? - No. Egyptian. - Your family's still in Algeria? - [Kahil] Some in Algeria, some in France. I have a big family. - Do you go home a lot? - [Kahil] No. - [Frankie] You must miss it. - No. - It's just me and my dad. He worked on Concorde. Long way before I can match that. [laughs] - And your mother? - She died when I was young, car accident. I can still remember her laugh. [slow soft music] [keyboard clicking] [gasps] Hey. You're not supposed to see this. - Come to bed. - No, I'm serious. - You're working on drones. What type of payload is it? - It's private. - Really? - Really. And my work takes precedence over everything and everybody. - Except for my body. - One little thing. - Mm hm. - [Frankie] Then I join you. - [Kahil] Okay. Goodnight. - Goodnight. [Kahil sighs] [computer beeps] [birds chirping] [drone humming] - [Frankie] Nice. Ya, you modified the wings. - Just tinkering. I wasn't happy with its maneuverability. - [Frankie] I know how you feel. - Don't give in to those vortex generators. That Robert's a fool. - I won't. [sighs] And he's not. It's still hard going. - It's meant to be hard going. You're at the top of your game, well, nearly there. How's the new boyfriend? - What? - Got a bit of color in your cheeks; sex must be good. - Dad! - What's his name? - Kahil. - Kahil what? What kind of name is that? - French Algerian, engineering student. - A bit young for you. - How do you know he's a bit young for me. - I just assumed. Do you think it wise, to have an Arab boyfriend, I mean, given the nature of your work? - Dad, come on! Just 'cause he's-- - Now hear me out, Frankie. I'm just thinking of your career. - Am I only allowed to date white, middle-aged men? - What's wrong with white, middle-aged men? - All right, yup, thank you. This is a ridiculous conversation. - Frankie. You don't even know his surname. - Wouldn't it be awful-- - I'm only looking out for you. - If this just crashed into the ground. - Hey, hey, take care. Be careful, watch out. [Frankie mimics plane crashing] [bell dings] - Hey, it's me. Can I come up? - [Frankie] No. - What? - No. I don't know who you are. - What do you mean? - [Frankie] Tell me your name. - Frankie. - Mr. Kahil, tell me your last name. [slow soft music] - [Kahil] Hey, your neighbor just gave me a funny look. Let me in. - Tell me your last name. Or else. Do you refuse? - Othmani. - Othmani? - Ya. - [Woman] Can I help you? - Shit. [door buzzes] Kahil Othmani. You're angry with me. You're not gonna show your anger. Am I that intimidating, Mr. Othmani? Come on, Mr. Othmani. Is that your anger? [zipper unzips] [both heavily breathing] [Kahil grunts] [birds chirping] [airplane humming] [plane engine roaring] [digital beeping] Fuck. - Fuck. - Ah, that's unanimous then. [Robert sighs] Let's call it a day. It's almost five. - But we've got that meeting at 5:30, remember? The team, has a meeting. - Reschedule. I have to go. - You're the boss. - Had enough for one day, Dr. Lethbridge? - [Frankie] First time for everything, Terry. - [Terry] Making your escape, eh? - [laughs] See you tomorrow. - See ya. [traffic humming] [knocking on door] [phone dialing] [phone ringing] - [Voicemail Operator] Welcome to the messaging center. Please leave a message after the tone. [phone beeps] - Hi, I came over to your place to surprise you. You're not here. I thought you said you worked at home on Tuesdays? Um. No matter. Call me. [traffic rumbling] [intense dramatic music] [men chattering] [phone dialing] [phone ringing] - [Kahil] Hey, Frankie. - Hi. What are you up to? - [Kahil] Oh, nothing, studying. Computational fluid dynamics, something like that. Ah, Frankie, I'm sorry. Someone at the door, see you later, okay. [phone beeps] [intense dramatic music] - Um, listen, I was wondering, could you do me a huge favor? - [Woman] I can try. What do you want me to do? - There's a student in the engineering department who I lent a book to. Ya, generosity herself. Anyway, I've just realized I've got some notes in it and I can't get in touch. Kahil Othmani. I don't even know what year he's in. - [Woman] Okay, hold on. Nothing with that name. - Nothing? - [Woman] Nothing I can find. [intense dramatic music] [people chattering] [digital beeping] [dog barking] - Hi. - [Frankie] You've got a fucking nerve. - [Kahil] What do you mean? - You're not an engineering student, you're a taxi driver. I saw you lying to me, Kahil. I saw you in the taxi yesterday. - [Kahil] Can we do this somewhere else? - [Frankie] No. - I was a student. My uncle in Paris was paying my fees. He died, so I had to give up the course. But I tried to keep up with my studies, so one day I can finish the degree. [dog barking] It's not easy. I couldn't get my Visa renewed, so I'm here illegally and Malik let's me drive his taxi. - Sorry, you're illegal? - Ya. - Oh. - It happens to many people. It's not a big deal. - It's not a big deal? Shit, I don't believe this! - You want me to go? - Yes. Just don't ever lie again to me, Kahil! Promise me! [speaks foreign language] Did you just tell me to piss off? [laughs] - No. I said I promise, my love. [speaks foreign language] [clock ticking] - Kahil. [Kahil groans] Kahil. [Kahil groans] I want you to stop driving the taxi. - [Kahil] Hm? - I want you to stop driving the taxi. - [Kahil] I can't, I need the money. - Ya, but if you get pulled over you're going to be arrested. It's so dangerous. [Kahil sighs] - I'm used to it. - [Frankie] You could work for me. [clock ticking] [wind blowing] - Work for you? You mean, do research for you? - No, I meant repainting my flat. [both laughing] No, I'm serious. I've been meaning to do it for months. It would be a huge favor for me. I've got paints, I've got brushes. What? - Is this how you see me, as some kind of servant? - Oh, geez, no, Kahil. I just want to help, it'll be temporary. Before we sort something out. [birds chirping] [slow soft music] [engine starting] [car beeping] [digital beeping] [cars humming] - Morning, Dr. Lethbridge. Would you be so kind as to park on the other side? - [Frankie] Right now? - [Terry] Yes, right now, please. Thank you. - Sorry, could I know what this is about? - Drive on through, doctor and I'll meet you on the other side. [clock softly ticking] - Dr. Lethbridge, sorry about the wait. Nina Simons. [digital beeping] - Sorry, what's this about? - [Nina] How long have you known Kahil Othmani? - Why, what's going on? - [Nina] Just answer the question please. How long have you known Mr. Othmani? - Uh, three weeks. He's a friend. - [Nina] Right. He's 24 years old, Algerian, a part-time taxi driver. - Yes. - [Nina] Are you aware that he's an illegal immigrant? - No. - [Nina] We're concerned that you're putting yourself in an awkward position. - Are you asking me to stop seeing him? - [Nina] His immigration status is really neither here nor there to us. That's more of an issue for our colleagues in the border agency. We're here just to make sure that no one takes advantage. - [clears throat] I see. - [Nina] Anything that seems out of the ordinary? A question, a phone call, an acquaintance? Please don't hesitate to call me. - [Man] Night, Frankie. [digital beeping] - [Robert] Frankie, you okay? - [Frankie] Just tired. - [Robert] You staying on? - Ya, for a bit. - Sure you're all right? - Christ! You're not my father. [wind blowing] [traffic humming] [digital beeping] - See you tomorrow. - Good night, boss. [speaking foreign language] [intense dramatic music] - Oh my god. - Um, it looks worse than it is. [speaks foreign language] [Kahil laughs] - [Malik] Frankie. [intense dramatic music] [dog barking] - Hey baby. Now I look like a criminal, ya? You like it? - What happened? - Well, I was happily painting your flat, thinking to myself I'll be rich soon with such a job-- - Kahil, what happened? - Well, Malik got into an argument with a couple of guys who live with us. They wanted to kick Malik out of the house. I went over and I got into a fight, that's it. - Well, I didn't see Malik with a black eye. - Malik is like a brother to me. - Really? Now he knows where I live? - [Kahil] What do you mean? - [stammers] I just don't, I just don't want strangers in my flat. - Malik is not a stranger. - [stammers] I don't know where he is or what he's up to. - What do you mean? Up to what? - I hardly know you and now my flat is full. - What are you saying? [sirens distantly blaring] - Don't you find it all a bit strange? - [Kahil] What? - Us. The two of us getting together. Some people might find it a bit weird. I mean, perhaps you do... Maybe after we... - After we make love, I don't feel weird. I feel quiet. On every place on my body. And for a while, okay, a little while, all the worries of my life are gone. [machine beeping] [wind howling] [speaks foreign language] [Frankie panting] [wind whistling] [clock ticking] [speaking foreign language] [thunder rolls] [slow intense music] [machine beeps] [doors banging] [moves into intense dramatic music] [Robert chattering] - Look, Frankie, I don't know what's been happening with you lately-- - It is none of your business. - But if we don't, if we don't make this deadline-- - I'm not-- - And the way things are going we haven't got a fucking prayer. And we can kiss goodbye to this company's chances of every getting another defense contract. - Are you telling me how to do my job? - I'm telling you that it's not just your career on the line. [phone ringing] [computer beeps] - [Frankie] His name's Raheem. This one's Malik. Malik's a friend of Kahil's. Raheem, I've seen from a distance. - [Nina] Where? - In Easton, in a football match. - [Nina] Have they ever been to your flat? - No, I don't know them. I'm sorry, what is this about? - [Nina] They have become persons of interest to us, along with your boyfriend. - Person of interest? - [Nina] Has it never even crossed your mind? A woman of your age, in a sensitive industry. [seagulls cawing] [foreign music playing] [speaks foreign language] [intense dramatic music] [wind blowing] - [Kahil] Hi. - Hi. [wine pouring] - You okay? - [Frankie] We need to talk. - About what? - I'm behind in my work. I've got a deadline I'm not gonna make. - [Kahil] You didn't tell me. - Why should I tell? Why should I tell you anything? - Hey! - The fact is I can't work with you here. I need to work, without distraction. - Are you breaking up with me? - My work keeps me going. It has to come first. [slow intense music] [sighs] - Your work. - What about it? - Do you know what your drones do? Who they kill? - The UAVs are targeted at the enemy. - And the neighbors? The wedding parties? The village elders? Do you even know the ratio of civilians to enemy death? It's 15:1. 15 civilians to one intended target. This is not about your work. This is about people like me, who are there, down on the ground, below your drones. This is your fucking sensitive work. [intense dramatic music] [glass shattering] - Get out, get the fuck out! Fuck out! For the painting. - Fuck you! [weeping] [sighs] [sighs] [dramatic orchestral music] - It's amazing what you've achieved, no? With those [Frankie sighing] toerags at the MOD, huh? I always knew you'd crack it. Where's that white vase? - Just use the other one. [sighs] [water running] - How are things with Kahil? - We've broken up. - Who broke up with who? - I broke up with him. - I am sorry. [clock ticking] [traffic humming] [children distantly playing] She'd have been so proud of you. - I can't remember enough of her. What did you love most about her, Dad? - [Victor] Hm? - What did you lost most about her? - Remember that song? ♪ I love the way you always treat me ♪ ♪ Tenderly ♪ But darling, most of all ♪ I love how you love me Her love was total. Full on. - And you loved her back like that? - I don't know. [children distantly playing] [traffic roaring] [car alarm blaring] [knocking on door] - Is he in? - [Malik] What if he is? - I need to see him. [traffic roaring] [dog barking] [knocking on door] [door creaking] [people distantly shouting] [papers shuffling] - Where have you been? - Missing you. [sighs] [footsteps thudding] [door closes] - I should not forgive you. [sighs] [Frankie panting] [both grunting & panting] - I looked at your computer. I saw Islamic sites and I thought... [Kahil laughs] - Um... [sighs] I keep up with the news in Algeria and the fundamentalist sites tell the truth about the government. - You have so many secrets. [Kahil laughs] [sighs] - Ya. But secrets are not the same as lies. [sighs] [door bangs] [speaking foreign language] [shouting in foreign language] [slow intense music] [pounding on door] - [Kahil] Frankie? Are you okay? - Ya, I'm fine. [intense dramatic music] I'll be out in a minute. Oh my god, I've just noticed the time. I need to go. - Why? Stay. What's wrong? - Nothing. Really. - [Kahil] Malik and I are always arguing. - I just need to work. You know me. [intense dramatic music] - [Kahil] Okay. [knocking on door] - Frankie. - I can't remember anything else. Sorry. - Thank you. You've been very helpful. - [Frankie] Please, will you tell me? What's going on? Who is he? - Kahil Othmani spent 18 months in an Algerian prison. - Christ. What did he do? - [Nina] Can I have a word, sir? [slow intense music] - Subversive activity. What does that me? - That's all I can tell you. They've gone now, the house is empty. - [Frankie] What? - Do you know where he is? - No. No, [stammers] I've got no idea. [intense dramatic music] - [Nina] Sir, we should go. - You'll tell us if he contacts you. [intense dramatic music] [sighs] [phone ringing] - Hey, you. If there's anything I can do, anything at all. - What do you mean? - Your, uh, your dad phoned me. It's unbelievable. [sighs] But don't worry, okay? They'll find him and most likely they'll deport him, let the Algerians deal with it. You're safe. [people chattering] [phone ringing] [keyboard clicking] [birds chirping] - [Frankie] Sorry, excuse me. I don't know if you'll remember me, from the restaurant. It's about Kahil. - [Dima] Look, I don't know you. I'm sorry. - Look, I know there's no reason to talk to me. Would you tell me, how did he get his scars? [seagulls cawing] - He was tortured. - Why? - He was a student leader, a socialist. - But why are the police after him? Why is he hiding guns? - They weren't his guns! How could you believe that? [weeping] [intense dramatic music] [door closes] [pounding on door] - [Frankie] Listen to me. - What do you want? - [Frankie] It's important I talk to him. [door clicks] [speaks foreign language] [baby crying] - Um... I brought you some money. You could run. - I don't want your help. - Look, I know that I-- - You people, always think you know, but you know nothing. [slow intense music] - You're right. [door bangs] [police shouting] [intense dramatic music] [people screaming] [Frankie crying] [baby crying] - [Nina] We're very grateful to you, sir. - [Victor] Well, I just thought it for the best. - Here she is now, alive and well. - [Frankie] Fuck you! - Frankie. - Be very careful, Dr. Lethbridge. We could still charge you as an accessory. - You'd need real evidence for that. - You didn't contact us. - [Frankie] Look, look, he's innocent. - [Nina] We can hold him for up to 28 days. Then he'll be someone else's problem. [people chattering] - Why is she grateful to you, Dad? - [Victor] [sighs] Let's go. It's been-- - Why is she grateful to you, Dad? What did you do? - I never felt, I never. [sighs] I did it to protect you. - What? - Made a phone call. To alert security. - What? Why? When? - At the very beginning; look, I had to do it. Frankie-- - Don't touch me! Just get away from me, Dad! You know, just leave me alone! Just leave me alone! [high heels clicking] [door closes] [police radio chattering] - [Robert] Uh, this one's to stay. - Dr. Lethbridge. - Ya. - Thank you, sir. [police radio chatters] - [Frankie] Hello. [clears throat] - We just need to make sure we've got all our research. - [Guard] Two minutes. [horn sounds] [bell buzzes] [people chattering] [bell buzzes] [door clinks] [wind blowing] [intense dramatic music] [plane engine humming] [plane engine roaring] [intense dramatic music] [moves into soft intense music]
