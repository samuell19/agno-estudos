They have been made possible by funding from A Carle-Lamy production With the Financial Participation of Hand over the hockey sticks. Sorry. What is it? The commissioner's expecting me in his office in 10 minutes. In 10 minutes, we'll be gone. - Where are you going? - Louiseville. If I tell the commissioner, he'll hit the roof! Let him! So what? We can't finish a film on textiles without going to Louiseville. Exactly. You're not done yet... When I do business with hotels, they expect me to provide a dancer from Tuesday night up 'til Sunday. When you leave with a client on Friday and no one's there the entire weekend, I'm in shit on Monday! And I hate shit... Get my drift? You bastard... That's enough! What? The Louiseville train leaves in half an hour. - Where to? - The ChÃ¢teau.

You sure look swell today, Bob! I just spoke with a couple of government officials. Looks like they'll give us $85,000 for skidoo trails. They call it ''Local Development''. Second year in a row we got it. Helps to have friends in the right places. You gotta know how to tango. Most people are out of work these days. The textile factory's talking about laying off another 200... Same old story! Hiya! - Howya doing? - Number one! - Didn't travel alone. - No, sir! My wife's getting your room ready. Upstairs. Is that my room? It's the dancer's room. I'm not sleeping there. I want a motel room out back. They're for the clients... Okay, take the one at the end. If we're booked up, you'll have to move. You're supposed to provide room and board. I'm not a dog. Dogs sleep outside. Yeah, but they don't dance. Motel rooms must be warmer, eh? I think I'll take one. I'll have a Negroni, please. Don't think we have any. How about a ''Between the Sheets''? I'll have a Yellow Bird. - Four small beers. - Right. Would you like to join us? They told us you're the new dancer. You do a good show? Hope you like it. - Want something to drink? - No thanks. Are you musicians? - Do we look like musicians? - Yeah. Channel 13, eh? - That's right. - Want to interview me? Can't just now. When's this gonna be on? Sunday, midnight! Why not come by the clubhouse? It's in a boat, see? It'd be a first. Okay, but we have to shoot now and there's too much noise! You don't own this street! Give us a chance! We have to do it here! Go fuck yourself! It all happened... on December 11th, 1952. We'd been on strike since early March. Around 7 a.m., people started forming a picket line... in front of that gate. Suddenly they opened the back doors... and the Provincial Police came out. The Riot Squad. The company let them in during the night. They started throwing tear gas, then they used their clubs on us. Before passing out, I saw them get their guns out, and start firing into the crown. - Who do you work for? - The National Film Board. Why are you shooting here? We're doing a film on textiles. Did the company agree to let you film? No, no... Not really. They just called us. They asked you to find out what we're doing here? Are they worried? They wanna know why you're filming. It's their property. Let's see your driver's license and registration. 27. End slate. Later, the papers said... the strikers had attacked the police. The Prime Minister blamed us for resorting to violence. So they dissolved the union. And then, a month later, everybody returned to work. The company... had to pay out an extra 1.5 cents per hour. But me... I got canned. I can't really complain. I found another job, a good one. I clean schools at night for the school board. A while ago, I read in the paper... the guy who was captain of the squad in '52 just became head of the Provincial Police. Funny, eh? - Hi, guys! - Hello, sir. - Hello, Mr...? - Carpentier. Right! How are you Mr. Carpentier? Not bad. So you had a run-in with the local police? My secretary called them. She's a little high-strung. Mind telling me what your film's about? The textile industry. Textiles? Right... - Are you from the CBC? - No. - The National Film Board. - I see. Because I have good friends over at the CBC. Are we staying here? Come to my office! Our general manager would really like to meet you. Okay. Let's say... half an hour? - We gotta stop by our hotel. - Half an hour? Okay. See you later. Don't mock my tux. - He looks like a pimp. - He is. It won't work this time. So? All right, gals! Do us proud, okay? It's not every day you get to be in a movie! Who knows? Maybe one of you will become a star! - Mr. Chabot! - Yeah? Can we go to your office? We must prepare your interview. Sure, sure! But... Better be prepared. Gives you time to think. Yes, but... People get nervous in front of a camera. - I really should stay... - No, no. Mr. Chabot told us, just like that. At the end of March, they're laying off 190 people. 70 women and 120 men... They're upgrading equipment and making changes in production. We didn't react. We couldn't believe it. The Manpower people were really great. They got me a good job in Ontario right away. But I don't speak English. And moving to Ontario... What'll I do if they dismiss me in 6 months? Besides, when you're the new girl in the factory... you gotta take the machines nobody else wants. Ninety cents an hour, maybe a dollar. Forty bucks a week when there's six of us. Most summers, we can get by, but come winter, we're dead broke. And I can't handle working as a charwoman any more. I'm getting too old. I'm waiting until they throw us out, then moving to Montreal. My fiancÃ© is already there. Wouldn't stay anyway. Not enough jobs, and the pay's too low. In small towns like this, with only 1 or 2 factories, if you lose your job, there's nowhere else. That's why they have to use Latinos for the night shift. - What? - Latinos. You know, people from South America. Didn't you see them? He says it's some ''Chavez'', who works for some American company. He went down to Colombia, hired them and brought them all the way here. Ask if there are Colombians working in textiles here or in the States. He says they're working everywhere now. North Carolina... New Jersey, Boston, New York... He's not sure they're in textiles in New York. They make about 125 a week... and clear about 85. They probably deduct plane fare. He used to do the same job back home, so he's fairly happy. Same job, you know? Yeah, some game! Anybody want to play with us? You play pool? Why not play with them? We'll play you. Ain't gonna be much of a game. Wanna bet? Yeah, dancers make lots of dough. I feel bad about this. I gotta ante up, right? I'll be right back. Ten balls? - Right. Who's breaking? - Go ahead. - No rush. - You wanna do it? - Go ahead. You break like a girl! Show him how. One down... Did you call it? Call it? We agreed: call the shots. Five in the side pocket. Twelve... in the corner. No, two... in the corner. Number one... over in the corner. Twelve, side pocket... Seven by fifteen, corner. Ten... probably. Yeah, ten to the side. Five-zero? Fifteen by three. Four in the corner. Thirteen in the center. Yup! Five-three. Fourteen in the corner. Five-four, right? Go get the rack. Eleven in the corner. Put it back. Three in the corner. Five-five. If I do it, what'll you give me? A kiss. ''Kiss'' Six-five. Seven-five. Ten to the side. Eight-five. Nine in the corner pocket. And the eight, same place. Nine-five... Ten five. That cost you 20 bucks. Wanna play another? Some other time. That's five you owe me. No. Tonight. I even found my sister's skates. Okay. Perfect. You can come too. I don't know about that... The hotel's empty. Besides, your husband's here. The first boy I dated played hockey. Junior ''A'' in Trois-RiviÃ¨res. You married, Gina? Boyfriend? What's his name? You married? Any kids? And are you married? You got kids? And him? Is he married? He says he isn't, but he might as well be. That's what you think! - I suppose this one's married too? - Yup. What's up? Quite a few married guys! We're married, but not fanatically so. You fool around? Nah, we don't fool around! Well, me neither. We should go skating on the river. You guys work real hard! So do you! But not for CBC wages! Reel 59. I was born on a farm, in the St. Lawrence valley. near the border with Maine. There were 12 of us at home. My father unloaded the farm and got a job in textiles. After the big strike, dad died... so I had to get a job. I was just 13, but since I was an orphan, I got a work permit. The first time I set foot in a factory, the big boss asked me... ''Got any experience? What have you done?'' I told him, ''Nothing. Can't even thread a needle.'' So he says, ''What are you doing here, then?'' I said, ''If you show me, I'll learn. I'm just as smart as the next girl.'' He saw I was serious, I wasn't there for fun. So he sat by me for the whole day, 7 'til 5. It was a 9-hour workday. He showed me how the machine, every little detail. At first, it was complicated. I was nervous and kind of lost, I guess. But that's how I got my start. A year later, the manager came and said, ''You're young, you can still learn.'' I was 14. ''We'll try you on the flatlock.'' That's the hardest machine in the business. It gave me backaches. By the time I got home, I was so tired and edgy I couldn't even eat. I didn't want to see anyone. I'd stay in my room, alone, and wouldn't talk. Finally, I told my mom. ''I can't do it anymore. I'm gonna quit.'' My sister also worked for them. She told me I shouldn't quit. Eventually I'd get used to it. So I went back to work and now, I'm used to it. Before getting married, I was a nurse at the HÃ´tel-Dieu in Trois-RiviÃ¨res. The operating unit. I worked with surgeons and anesthetists. Marty was fed up with his job, all that travelling.... we got married and started paying off the hotel. Good evening. Evening. Hello, Marty! Better go change, eh? Your wife seems tired. Women are always tired. Anyway, I didn't twist her arm, you know. She didn't want me gone for days on end, so I couldn't work on the road any more. Last winter, I asked my brother-in-law to mind the hotel and I took her to Hawaii. Shoulda seen her when she got back! Down on all fours, washing floors... Boy, was she in a good mood! Pretty bad, eh? Seems the clients like it. You got great legs. Good evening. - Hello. -Good evening. What'll you have? Gin and tonic. Molson. Do you serve ''Between the Sheets'' here? Tell the dancer I'd like to buy her a drink. Bring us... 11. Thirty big ones. - That'll get us started. - You're already pissed! Say? It's Dolores. Too good for us, Dolores? You prefer the TV guys? They're no better than us. She'll know that by tomorrow. I'm telling Jack! He won't like it. He works like a dog just to marry you! Nice blouse. Know where it's from? - A store. - Before that. - Before what? - Before the store. I dunno. - Is that cotton? - Sure! Sewn in a sweatshop, maybe even by Dolores. Our stuff's not so nice. Before that, someone wove the cotton, combed it, carded it... Before that, down in Mississippi, some negro had to pick it. - Got something against my blouse? - No. Don't worry, I'll take it off. That's why they pay me. Aren't they funny! Smart too. - And we're not? - No, we're plain boring. Don't you think we're smart? When can we see your tits? - Hope they're worth it. - I wanna see her ass. Probably has cellulite. Looks like it. Your kid sister got any? Hands off, you creep! Here... Put a quarter in the jukebox and go dance with Carol. - Why? - What for? Get lost! As a businessman, I'll get to the point. You free afterwards? Not even for... $100? - No thanks. I don't do that. - $150. Money's no object. I never date customers. - Sure? - Quite sure. Too bad. You can go. Let's dance. Let go. Marty! Tell her to dance with your best customer! Come on, Gina. Dance with him. - What happened? - Search me. What smartass unplugged it? Little bitch. You'll have to make do with a hand-job, Bob. How much money do you make? Depends... Usually 75 to 80 bucks. Piecework, eh? Right. How much do you make? It also depends. About 400... 450. You like 'em? We're working tomorrow. See you. G'night, Dolores. Wake me up in the morning. Amazing man. When you get home after work, you feel so tired, so worn out, you don't feel like dancing. Textile workers get old before their time. When you work, you gotta think of something else. If you think about the job, you won't last a week. You'll go crazy. All I hope for is that one day, I'll be able to afford everything I've always wanted... A new coat, a stereo, a convertible... with... white-wall tires, silver exterior, black upholstery... a vacation in Atlantic City... I don't wanna be a millionaire... Even if I had a million dollars, I wouldn't have quite the same satisfaction, you know. You'll say I can't make ends meet, and I work like a dog... just to buy a raincoat or some piece of furniture. At least I have the satisfaction of knowing I earned what I got. I earned that furniture myself. Nobody bought it for me. I worked hard for it without stepping on anyone. There's some satisfaction in being poor, see. Carol! How's my cellulite? We should go. It's still early. She starts at 7:00 morning. - Good night. - G'night. Why don't you sit with us? What'll It be? - Gin. Bring her a double. Gina... we may kid around, but we're crazy about you. Personally, that was the finest dancing I've ever seen. You liked the show? They're still all hot to trot. Shut your mouth. Tell her you wanna lay her and get it over with. Hold it. Finish that drink. Tell her you love her. Watch your mouth, eh? No fighting here! I don't want any trouble. - That little bitch! - Christ! Forget it! Gina. You owe me some kisses! Shoulda taken them when I said. - I'm going to bed. - Alone? Damn right! I promise you I'll bring you back by 3:00. - I'll make it $35. - Pay me now. - Don't trust me? - I remember last time. Last time you didn't do anything. I won't do just anything. You knew that. Okay. I'll wait for you in my car. [TV announcer - weather forecast] Who is it? It's Marty. What is it? I wanna check your thermostat. Not too cold? It's fine. If it gets too hot, just turn it down. - If you want something else... - No thanks. Don't be shy. Your wife's waiting for you. Good night. See you tomorrow. [TV announcer - TV programs for the next day] I can't... I don't know why... Now you can... do it... Atta boy... Go on... that's it... All right... Next! Know what? I don't feel like it anymore. This one's during the big strike. Did the police fire at them? Sure. - They really shot them? - Yeah. See? There's the police station. And the union was upstairs. I see... Wait! ''If worker will not save worker, who will save him? We'll win our rights despite our detractors!'' That's in the union headquarters. The police raided it? Some of the strikers didn't want to come out, so the police broke into the place, and the men jumped out a window. Something like that anyway. This is in a private home. After they raided the union headquarters, they had to meet in private homes. - The police raided those too? - Yes. After all that, you worked for them? Keep it down. You'll wake everyone up. Why are you here? I don't work tomorrow. I wanted to see you. - This is Jack, my fiancÃ©. - Hi. - Hello. I'll be going now. I'll take the photo album and film it in the morning. Take care of it. - Are you guys pissed? - 'Course not! Can you wake me up around 10:00? - Where's Gina? - She went to bed. - Why don't you sit with us? - Leave me alone. - What's wrong? - Leave me alone. Beefy! It's like there's 10 of them! Hello! We're in trouble? If we weren't, you wouldn't be here. You started shooting at the factory yesterday? The manager notified head office in Montreal. The president had a meeting with the commissioner, last night at the Canadian Club. Your film's on hold... as of this morning. Didn't want to tell you on the phone. - They've no right-- - They can do what they want. Anyway... you're barred from every textile factory in Canada. All the companies have been warned. One more thing. This morning around 9:00, the assistant commissioner seized your negative. We got a union. They'll defend us. Sure! Who? No. What we gotta do is save the negative. Anyone want a ride with me? I'm alone in my car... Christ, I've had it! I tell you, I've had it! Those bastards are gonna pay! Fifteen of them, Christ! I've been pushed around before, but there's a limit! There's a goddamned limit! All right. Let's start by having a word with our friend Marty. Marty around? He's gone to get the liquor. Tell him we're waiting at the bar. Will you be back? I don't know. You weren't here long, eh? Uh, no. See you. Good luck! Goodbye. Good luck to you too. Couldn't leave without saying goodbye. Goodbye. Anything we can do for you? What? I don't know. I meant to ask you, what's your name? - Gina. - No, your real name. Gina. - Okay. See you. - Bye. Dolores! We got problems with the film. We're going back to Montreal. I left the album at your mother's. - Good luck. - Thanks. Better go. You're on private property, get it? This is company land, so move on! You had a skidoo club last night? Right. I want everyone's name. I want to hear everything you know. I run a business. I can't annoy my clients. I don't want no trouble. Exactly. They're in a deserted boat downriver... just past the shipyard. Don't recognize me? You weren't so shy yesterday. You're drinking a lot. How's your love life? Two quarts of Tanqueray! Hi. Hello. - Just off work? - Right. I better go. My fiancÃ©'s waiting. You better hurry. Don't make trouble: it won't change anything. Oh yeah? Ever seen the statues in parks? Statues? Yeah, in parks or in front of buildings. Sure. Ever see a statue of a guy who never hurt anyone? You've lost me. Well, I've seen the statue of Duplessis, the statue of Churchill, the statue of de Gaulle, of Napoleon... Sons of bitches, all of 'em! Bunch of thugs! That's what people respect. The guys that come here every night, try helping 'em out. Take away their skidoos and they'll spit in your face. But bring in a dancer to get 'em drinking... They'll borrow and dump the money at your feet! They'll do anything... Don't you and your husband? It's no use complaining. People gotta be scared of you. That's all they understand. - The old shipyard? - Down the road. Well, sure I saw her today... twice. - And? - Nothing. We shouldn't have done it. Girls like that stay away from the cops. Just forget it. How about a visit to the captain's quarters? Pretty noisy piss! I killed him 'cause I love him. Okay, cut! Cut! Set up for the next shot. - So? - Perfect. - Was I all right? - Sure. - Was my hair hiding...? - No. It was fine. The microphone didn't show? I went to bed early to be in shape today. - You look great. - You're so nice! How did it go? Microphone in place? Don't think so. Was it in the shot? Well, that's a first!
