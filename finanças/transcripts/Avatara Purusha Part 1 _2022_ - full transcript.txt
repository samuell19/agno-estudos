He brought you here to enchant you! Go home! *Chanting Mantra* *Chanting Mantra* *Chanting Mantra* Why didn't it work? Fire, Air, water, sky and Earth This is a world of Five Spirits! ...a place of sacred rivers! Perfect for normal human beings... But for Dark magicians like us... ...we need a different realm! What realm is that? Trishanku Realm! But we need Trishanku Gemstone to access that realm! Darka was searching for hints of the gemstone all these years! I'm trying gain access without the gemstone... ...but it's not working! What is Trishanku Realm? Is the Gemstone that powerful? ...Where is it now? Trishanku was the King of Ishvaku dynasty in the age of the Triads. He wanted to go to heaven without going through death, along with his body. He met Vishwamitra, who promised to send him to heaven through the power of his penance. Indra the king of heaven, tries to stop this. Not giving heed to Indra, Vishwamitra sends Trishanku on the way to heaven. But the three gods together stops Trishanku, stating that this is against the laws of nature. But Vishwamitra creates a new heavenly world just for Trishanku. One that doesn't belong to the Earth, nor to the heaven and that world is known as Trishanku Realm! Kicked into the realm by Devendra... Trishanku has to stand upside down to experience the world! To make sure that no one else gets fooled like this... ...he converts the gemstone as a key and hands it over to the Goddess Maya. His plan was to make sure that Dark Magicians on Earth would be able to acquire this key, So as to use the heavenly power of Trishanku realm and rule the Earth. Among them was Darka, a great Dark magician, who held penance for many years to get this gemstone. He used to Kidnap kids and, ...absorb their soul using Black Magic... ...to preserve his powers! Foreseeing the complications that could arise from this... the messenger God "Brahma Joyeesa" stands as an obstacle for Darka. Even to date, few black magicians... ...do human sacrifices to acquire the Gemstone! I'm so hungry... -Break! Lunch! Useless fellow... announcing break at 3pm! ...is he mad? Hey Madhesha! Are you sleeping? Get up! It's lunch break! It's a break! Let's go Brother, it's break time... -Actually time is over, sir! This shot is okay. Finalise it! -Actually time is over, sir! This shot is okay. Finalise it! Anila where is the shoot tomorrow? Anila where is the shoot tomorrow? Anila where is the shoot tomorrow? In America! In America! I said I don't a passport but they asked me to fly using a parachute! Oh no! Mom! What's wrong? You seem off today. Oh wait! Today is December the 10th? Your brother's birthday. We should call it your sulking day rather than his birthday. Siri, You won't understand what I'm going through. Emotional drama again! I will understand if you speak it out. Why do you hide it from me? Hmmm... Malehonnur... ...my native village Even the thought of it makes me feel relaxed The House... rain... the people... We were all happy all the time! My grandfather and great grandfather... were all great Ayurveda doctors Everyone in the village used to consult them during sickness... My brother carried forward their legacy! Nowadays no doctors care about patients who don't have money but my brother was so selfless regarding people He has a lot of respect in the village He used to help everyone in one way or the other Maybe that's why, God has rewarded him with wealth! My sister-in-law was the perfect life partner for him She supported him in everything... He loved her a lot... His son Karna Everyone liked him a lot... Even though he was sweet he was equally naughty as well! He liked me a lot and always used to follow me everywhere I go... But there was a bad omen falling upon that house... One particular day... when I was pregnant with you i went to surprise my brother But my surprise did not work out with my brother... Yashodha! Brother! Bless me- -May you live long It's pouring outside, didn't Brother-in-law come? No, I've come alone Alright, Come on dear What happened? Hmm... Nothing You both have come No brother, I have come alone. You... ...and the child in your womb Susheela, get the plate of offerings. By the way... ...i had made a vow that I'll attend the Belagavi Temple fair Shall I go? Why not? You can go Temple fair? Father, please let me also go along Karna, keep quiet... You are too naughty Belagavi is too far... Don't be stubborn... Mother, please... Aunty... at least you tell them. I will also come. Brother, let him come. I will take care of him, please. Do you want to go? Hmm hmm Since he's going with Yashoda, let him go Yayy! I'm going too! I'm going too! Brother, I shall leave now. Be careful! Ok, dad Be careful Karna! Hmm... Bye! Karna! Karna! Hello Brother... It's me Yashodha -Tell me... Karna has gone missing during the fair... I don't know what to do... I have filed a complaint with the police... I am too worried...

Brother... I've searched everywhere... ...but i couldn't find him anywhere Please forgive me brother... It's very easy to forgive... We are going through a lot of pain of losing a son I hope no curse falls upon your child... Brother... Since then, I have not visited my parents' house. I can't go back until I find Karna. It's my brother's birthday... ...Everyone in the village would have gathered to celebrate... ...except for me. I don't even know if my brother remembers me anymore! Some people don't have a home to go to... ...but I... ...I can't even go even though i have one... We can just try and find Karna... Siri... I don't know where he is, I don't even know if he is alive... even if he is in front of me, I won't even recognize him. Isn't that an advantage? We can get someone to pretend like Karna. Come on Siri! My brother in an expert at Ayurveda... even though he has never met you, he will recognise that you are my daughter! Do you think he can be fooled by a fake Karna? Maa... Wait and watch... I will give them their Karna... ...and help you get back to your home. Where will you find such a Karna? Where else? In the Kaurava's place.

Whatever it may be, It's not right to fight like this. Let's sit and talk calmly. There is no calm way around this. Hmmm... Get the machete! Hey...we're not less than anyone. If you have twenty people on your side, we have forty people! Just because he's polite... you cross the lines and walk in as if this is your in-law's house! From 27 years things have been a particular way... From now on, it's going to be a new way... His son, Karna, Karna has come. Hmm Karna has come right, sort it out then... Huh? Looks like I've miscalculated... Father... Hey give the machete to the one who asked... Let's see what he will decimate Hey, look... Today is Friday, it's perfect day to meet the Lord of Death, come...! Today is Thursday! Thursday? Oh... Just missed... Week of the Lord Raghavendra! Today I can't lay my hands on anyone... Today you survived, But tomorrow at the same place, same time, there will be a war! A grand war! Condition! Tomorrow the number of people may be more, but it shouldn't be less even by one! Tomorrow he will come for war... I will finish him then and there! We'll worry about case and court later... Siri! It's so late, you still haven't slept? I had project work, just sending an email... I need to work according to the times abroad... That's alright, but what are you doing up so late? Bad dreams! Very bad dreams! That Ram Shetty comes like a devil and murders me in my dream... I delivered two extra dialogues because father was there... But he just left me there... Look, you said it would be acting, you didn't mention that there would be fight. Hello, did your father lose anything? Ram Joyeesa will lose his estate that's it... Go and sleep now... Oh that's right... If anything is lost its Ram Joyeesa's estate, not my father's plate. Now he'll go and narrate everything to aunt! Do you know what happened today? Father left me alone to deal with Ram Shetty over the dispute of the land. I'm scared thinking of what will happen tomorrow. Karna... your father has trusted you and handed you this responsibility. Assuming your father's goodness for cowardice, he's tormenting us. He is a demon! A demon... Now only you have to us from him. Huh...! Save them? I don't know how to save myself! Chamundeshwari! Only you can save me... Karna! Your mother says, hot water is ready for you to have an oil bath... Oil bath? There's a village fair today, that's why Only if I'm alive... Hello! Have you gathered everyone? What for? For the war! So you haven't heard? -What? Ram Shetty has got paralysis. Paralysis? God Chamundeshwari... ...you saved me... Is it confirmed? Mmm... On his left hand! No chance... He's doing dramas... to avoid the conflict... Go check it out... Everyone has seen him... You too go visit! I thought of giving a twist myself... ...but God has given the twist... -I'm getting my calculation wrong and he eats my head! Okay... What is that? It's been here for a long time... Since you have come... ...it's been shifted here. Since it's shifted... ...we have performed Digbandana ritual... Oh that's what you think? They might have a package inside... They have kept it like this because people like you steal! Touch it if you dare! Go on... Touch? -Ha You will turn into ashes if you get close to it See, It's working... that's why they have made it Go -Hey Get lost! If they have gone this far... ...there must be something valuable inside I need to check it out... Karna! It's getting late for the Pooja Go take bath Ha, Coming Mother, do the pooja...

[Karna in Beggar's Voice] Show me... [Karna in Beggar's Voice] Mother! *Giggles* Project completed within the given time! Hey! Did you draw this by looking at the TV or... ...is this is a coincidence? Good question...Good question! It's the confusion!... Who is this? Brother-in-law You should take care of your health You relax... I'll take care of arecanut business... No! The prestige lost due to petty issues... ...can never be brought back no matter what you do! Elders say, if you have betel leaf after food, it's good for the night. If you eat banana... it's good for the... ...morning! Watch how I impress him... Betel leaf?... *Coughs* Cow urine is good for the cough! This fellow is always out of sync. Boja... -Yes Bring me betel leaf... In panchavandana... Purification and practice of breath is very important. Close your eyes Ever since I've come, I've noticed... ...you haven't spoken to your son at all. Son? -Hmm! Who? Who else? Karna. I'll prove that he is not Karna, come with me! You guys carry on. (Singing...) Oh! You are here... *Singing - Come Raghavendra, Come* Look at his overacting! Keeping the tap on, he's drawing water from the well to have bath. Call him... What nonsense is this? Did I screw up? -He's calling you... -Coming Come fast... Coming... -Greetings Joyees Come. You wait outside... It's time for sun-salutation, that's why I was drawing water from the well to take bath. It's not time for sun-salutation... -Really? The time for salutation is before sun rise and after sunset! It's still a good time... Recite Gayatri... Your aunt's name is Janaki right? Recite Gayatri Mantra! Mmm... Mantra! Mantra it seems... Mantra... Om! Cough cough... What do I do now? Mantra... Mantra... (Gibberish...) Not this Mantra... should i recite it here itself? His expression is changing! This is the right place! this is the right place! (Chanting Mantra...) Sir, cut, sorry... Director sir, was the mantra like this? -Cut it! Not this... Which one is it then...? I've recited it somewhere before... Does he know the Gayatri Mantra? Sir overacting Anil is ready for an extent let's see during the take. Ok Ready... Camera! Rolling Sir. Action. (Chanting Mantra...) I remember, I remember! I remember everything... Father... when I was a kid, you chanted mantras in my ears, you did my thread ceremony, I remember everything, this same place, this same place. Hmmm Look... I knew he is doing drama as soon as he recited Gayatri mantra! He says that I had done his thread ceremony, but it's a lie. I never did the thread ceremony for my son I could help everyone... But i was depressed that I couldn't help my own family! Ever since he has come, I can see happiness on Susheela's face. Let him stay here... As a medicine for her... not in my heart. Siri! Tell him to act... But if he overacts... Everyone is bound to find out... ...just like I did The Sacred thread... ...is supposed to be on the other side. Arrgh!! Just missed! I managed everything, but he still found out. All because of you! Because of me? How can you say that? I'm trying so hard... You are blaming it on me?! I'm getting paid very less... and no value at all! Karna, wait! One minute I don't want anything here... Che! Wait... You don't know my range! Whatever I say, I'm wrong! -Anil! Wait! I need to teach you acting first! Me? Me? Me? Me Me Me... Instead of overreacting like this, you can simply say "Me?"can't you? I didn't select you because of your acting... You are selected because you can make them believe... First, learn how to control. What...!? What...? What? Good. You have controlled. I'm controlling my feelings for you, can't I control my acting... I will do it. Very good... To be an actor, be a good listener. She speaks excellent English! Act like you are not acting. What do you mean? I mean... if you feel you are acting, that is bad acting. Hello? If I don't feel that I am acting, how will others know? That is exactly what is needed. We shouldn't feel that we are acting, and the audience also shouldn't feel. What will happen then? Picture will flop. Shut up That's the best acting. For example, What is he doing there? Who? He's dehusking... Yes, how is he doing it? How else will he do it? With his hands... He is a natural actor. If you were in his place. See? this is overacting! So, he is the best actor. Him? The best actor? For de-husking, they will give him an Oscar award?! Where I go, I get oppressed. I was happy eating idli vada in the set, here everyone is trying to teach me how to act. Here... temple... Brahmarakshasan temple! Actually you know what this is...? Hey... don't change the topic... Class is going on. Fine... Next point. Hmmm. An actor should know how to control his breath. If you're very happy, how do you breathe? Through my nose... Through my nose. Now, if I'm happy with you, what do you feel? I feel butterflies in my stomach... Karna! I said what I feel... Now, I'm really happy... that's why I'm breathing evenly... Calm... Calm... Yes. Calm... Calm... Calm... Calm... Yes. Calm. Just feel it. Yes that's good, feel it. Hey who... where... what happened...? When we're really scared... faster we breathe... Faster, faster breath... Hey... Why what happened...? When you're really angry... we hold our breath... hold our breath... That's it. Class is over right, Alright, come lets go. Karna... Again? According to the situation you must be able to control your breath that's when your facial expressions automatically come in control. In that case, my neighbour Muniamma is great! Why? After she died, she didn't even breath. Stupid! Yes, but how do you know all this? I'm basically a theatre artist. That means, she's a junior artist like me. After I become a star, I should give her a chance ...and sing songs with her. ♪O Girl come sit on my Hero honda...

[On TV] *Indistinct Dialogue* My face? Hello brother! Just watch the next scene Me! although I appear just for a brief scene, I would have appeared in "Popular Late night Shows"! that is the range of my performance Watch! -What! you are on Tv? shhh...wait and see [On TV] hey, you are still so old fashioned that ring is too small you could have planned something bigger Here I come! Look! That's me... Look! Look! Look!... [On TV] Boss, what is the problem [On TV] The ring is too small it seems She is asking me for something bigger Correct! This ring is indeed small for her... I've an idea... Gift her an MRF tyre! Vijay! come here... That's me... *Laughs* How was the performance!? Now that's called a performance! -Karna! That guy looks just like you... Looks like me?... That's m... *Giggles* ...looks like me... Hmm... -Looks just like me Whenever he is on TV, I fool everyone like this... I fooled him too Oh...I really thought it was you... You too? Psst!... Come here Do you think my father used to visit Bangalore often? why? Because I saw a couple of people exactly like me in Orion mall *Laughs* Hey!...who switched on the TV? Turn it off! I don't care if don't get a share in the property... ...but he shouldn't get even a piece of it! Someone is here to see you Mr. Joyeesa Greetings... Greetings... My name is Parameshwara Bhat I am the president of Sirsi Village Panchayat I needed to clarify a couple of things with you hmmm...go ahead The boy who has returned home... is he?... ...really your son? why? Do you know a Kanti Joyeesa? Tell me who are you? I told you already... I'm Parameshwara Bhat! I have a matter to discuss... Tell me... Do you know a Kanti Joyeesa? My grandfather was cheated by my uncle... Thus, he was cut off from property sharing... Kanti is his son... I have heard his name but... ...I've never met him But... Why are you asking me all this? A farm house had caught fire near Sirsi Siddapura... everyone in the house died... But one boy survived... When asked who he is... Kanti Joyeesa had brought me here... and makes me do labour work, he said! The poor boy... ...had no knowledge about the outside world! Hmmm when asked about his roots, he mentioned about you and your family! Twenty years ago, the boy whom Kantee Joyeesa had kidnapped... ...could be the same boy... And he may be your real son! It is better... ...if you see him for yourself! Wait... Take this! Come... He is the One He isn't the One, I've told so... But no one believed me He is just a Junior Artist He'll act as a son for 500 bucks... And also as a thief for 1000 bucks You are right! Don't even know which caste he belongs to I wonder from where he has come from... Mr. Bhojraj! Father is here Let us ask him Let there be a decision on everything today! He'll confirm that i am his son! Janaki! -Brother! Get the plate of offerings... You will face the music now! Let's see about that... Father? What's happening? What's all this? Everyone is doubting me... Why don't you tell them that I am your Son Tell them... Medicine! Medicine! Medicine is essential to cure diseases... But every medicine has an expiry date... ...and will be thrown away It has to be gotten rid off... Father! You may Leave now Susheela! Your real son has arrived, Come. What is going on here? Am I supposed to be happy that my real son has arrived? Or... Should I be sad that he is not my actual Son? Please tell me! Why are you quite? While others make a living out of acting... He has made his whole life an act! If you feel that he is your Son... that means he's he is a good actor Not because he is really your son... Your real son has come you welcome him Mother! My relationship with the house has come to an end... Siri, thank you everything you have done for me Karna... Karna... Since that you are leaving... ...now there will be tears... Karna... -I brought him myself... It's upto you... Call our son... Karna! -Mother... Amma... He's not Krishna, Karna or Arjuna... He's Kumara!... Kumara!... Hello! Actor karna... You may leave now! Original has arrived! I forgot my Luggage! I'll get it... He just needs a reason to get in... Socks? Shoes? Don't waste time... Leave immediately... Hmm... I will leave now Your son has returned *Singing Gibberish* You don't have to stay in this room Please come I will show you a better room This room is auspicious and this suits me well as you wish Shall I get food here then? Yes Also, I need father's clothes Father's clothes? I reversed the spell on Ram Joyeesa... It wasn't him... *Talking Gibberish* He didn't do it too... Who is this guy? He has no clue about anything... Does he know Black Magic or not? Black Magic and Dark Magic are different! Black Magic is just a part of Dark Magic! Shall I call Abdullah? He can surely find out who did this... Do they use Sambrani for Black Magic? Players know their game... Magicians know their magic! What do you know? Black Magic Then do it Banana Fruit, Banana Leaves, Banana Stem and Banana flower! One of these has been used Who... Who... Who did this? He has also learned Witchcraft in Bistha, just like I did... What... What is Bistha? It's the sacred place of all wizards and witchcraft! All potential dark magic kids are brought there... ...and are taught magic! Even he has come from there... He's extraordinary!... Darka, Known as the Guru of Bistha! Munnudi and Hinnudi where his strength! While Munnudi was able to see a person's future... Hinnudi had the power to see a person's past! Similarly... Hinnudi's left eye had acquired the power to diminish his enemy's powers! Darka taught this kid advanced magic and skills... ...so as to make him his third source of power! The kid had learned to be thrice as powerful! But he backstabbed his own Guru! He fooled both Munnudi and Hinnudi... He killed the powerful Munnudi... ...and blinded Hinnudi's magic eye... And escaped from Bistha! He was never found since then... Who are you talking about? The magician who pretended to be... ...Ram Joyeesa's Son!! The one who did Black magic on you! How did you know it was him? As soon as i stepped foot in that house... ...i knew it was him... Proof being... The tattoo on his right foot And the ear rings! He danced his way out of the house... Making sure to leave no trace of black magic... He is responsible for all this... How did he do it? Using the bannana peel touched by you... ...and a sacrificial doll, he did a black magic on you! What is the solution for this? Hinnudi! Today is full moon day... Perfect time for destroying the... Ashtadigbandana Mandalaka! In order to acquire the Gemstone, the Ashtadigbandana Mandalaka... ...must be destroyed by one of their family members! Kumara will take care of that! There is a man who entered the house pretending to be the son... He has come with a secret plan for something... We have already... ...thrown him out! He's still there... He has started a sacrificial ritual! I know where he is! Darka will acquire the Gemstone... ...once the Ashtadigbandana is broken Darka wants the Gemstone... And you... ...want their property! After all this... ...if we acquire the gemstone... ...You will earn the property that is rightfully yours! In the end everyone will have a solution! What will i get? You've got it already! I will destroy him! Kumara will break the Ashtadigbandana using their own hands! *Chanting Mantra* Hinnudi! How ever you are... Wherever you are... And whatever it is... I'll always have an eye on you! Your life is through me, and so is your death. Brother, it's not you who decides Birth and Death. *Chanting Mantra* *Chanting Mantra* *Chanting Mantra* This is a Sacrificial Doll! On this sacrificial doll... ...if we pour the enemy's blood, ...his nails, ...or his hairs... ...and burn it... ...the enemy will be destroyed for good! Show me who killed Hinnudi... O! Magic Mirror! He has reached my destination faster than me... ...using the powers that I taught him... Does that mean...? ...his intentions are same as mine?... -Will I also be powerful if i acquire the gemstone? Does he have an eye on the Trishanku Realm too?! My own student is now my enemy!! O Hinnudi's Spirit!! What is the next step?! If he is using weird rituals... ...to pursue his Trishanku desires... ...how did he acquire that power?! His death will come by my hands!!
