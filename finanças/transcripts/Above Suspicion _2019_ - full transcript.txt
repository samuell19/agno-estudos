She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes She'll be coming round the mountain, coming round the mountain, Coming round the mountain when she comes, yeehaw! She'll be wearing pink pajamas when she comes, She'll be wearing pink pajamas when she comes, She'll be wearing pink pajamas, Wearing pink pajamas, Wearing pink pajamas when she comes, yeehaw! She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes, Lucie? THE PERFECT MAN Claire, look at me, please. BASED ON A TRUE STORY -I want Mom. -Claire, please. Open your eyes. When my mom gets here. No, Claire. I need to see now. Lift your head up. Claire! That's enough. Look at me. -How many fingers can you see? -Two. How long has your vision been blurred? I can't read the blackboard anymore. -Your father is on his way. -No. Mom comes home on Thursday. She can come and get me. Look to the right. Look to the left. Look up. My poor baby. I told you to go straight home. -Where is she? -With the doctor. Do you think it's serious? This is the third time we've been to the ER for a false alarm. I'm sure it is nothing serious. -I missed you. -Me too. Mr. and Mrs. Sémelin? Come with me, please. Mommy! Good news: your daughter isn't going blind. You won't need to buy her a cane just yet. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Have a good evening. -Goodbye, thank you so much. Unbelievable. You can't keep lying like this. Hey! Your eyes are working fine. Look at me when I'm talking to you! -Are you going to tell me off? -No, princess. Did I ever tell you about the boy who cried wolf? A young shepherd boy kept crying out there was a wolf because he was bored, so people would come and see him. But then one day, a wolf really did come. And he yelled "help" as loud as he could, but nobody came, because they didn't believe him anymore. I wasn't lying, though. I couldn't see at all. Are you sure you weren't imagining things, maybe? Hmm? OK. Never mind. One, two, three... Hug me! Lucie? She still won't admit it. I'm not surprised, she is as stubborn as a mule. She started doing this when I started working abroad during the week. Four days a week is too much for her. Time for the motherhood guilt trip? Four days isn't fair on you, either. I'm OK. I think I'm starting to make a very good mom. When they were born, you made the sacrifice. You quit your job. It's your turn now. And Claire's little guilt trips won't change that. She will get used to it. I must hide, because if he sees me... Is that the wolf... or my grandmother? I win! -Hey, Auntie! -Hello, darling! -Hi. -Hey, you. -Are you joining us for lunch? -I can't. Your mom did such a good job in Italy, that I have a ton of files to look at for tomorrow. What are you, married to your work? Get an assistant, it's Sunday! Good idea, I will tell the company. I'm sure the banker will be thrilled. Hey! Let's leave the bankers alone, please! Let's just get ready for the photo, OK? Yeah, yeah... Big smiles, please. Cheese! And now I want one with my gorgeous wife. Wow! -Blue and red. -Yeah. What are those? The colors of Daddy's soccer team. -Shall we give Daddy a surprise? -Yeah! -Do you want to do it? -OK. And I told you I want it working right now. Right now! Yeah. Yeah. I don't care if it is Sunday! Sure, sure. How dumb do you think I am? Listen, this isn't over. You will be hearing from me very shortly! Yes. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. What's going on, hon? Our connection is busted, and they refuse to do anything till tomorrow. Who are you calling now? Their third in command is a client of the bank's. You're calling the top brass because you can't watch one little match? A little match? It's Paris-Marseilles! It is "the" match! OK... First, you are not going to humiliate yourself by calling that man, and second: take your phone, go to the stadium, and grab a seat. Wait... Are you being serious right now? Yes. God, I love you! -Thank you. -You're welcome. Thanks girls, but Daddy's off to the stadium! Bye! -Bye, Dad! -Have a good evening, girls! -Girl's night in? -Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Look at that gorgeous tiara, it's so sparkly! You look beautiful, girls. -There. This is my bit. -You guys have made great progress! I didn't get to see it live. -Here, we'll show you. -Go on, then! Well done, girls. -Let's show you again. -No, -we are going to brush our teeth. -No! -Yes, we are! -No! No, I don't want to go to bed. And I won't go and brush my teeth. Don't start. Claire is annoying, isn't she? -One, two three... -Goodnight, Mommy. Goodnight, sweetheart. Here is your cuddly. Oh, sweetie! -What's got you so worked up? -Don't go tomorrow. I know, baby. But I will only be gone a few days, like usual. If you leave, I will die. Why would you say such a thing? Tell me what is upsetting you. Dad... he comes in... when you are not here. Your father? I'm not lying. No, I know, honey. I'm listening, tell me. I know it is normal... but I don't like to do it. You don't like to do what? LICK HIS PEE-PEE SO HE WILL GO TO SLEEP. In you go. I will talk to your dad about this. Don't! He will get mad. Don't worry. Everything will go back to normal. OK? -Yes. -Goodnight. I'M AT THE STADIUM! GOODNIGHT, MY DARLINGS. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. Why aren't you asleep? Paris won by 3 points, it was amazing. I had an awesome night. Hey, what's wrong? Claire. She said some horrible things. What now? She says you make her play with your penis, and put it in her mouth. And you believe her? No. I wouldn't be telling you if I did. Honey! Honey! Open the door, please. Let's wake her up. We'll see if she dares to say it to my face! We need to understand where this is coming from. She is only 9 years old. She plays with dolls. We put parental controls on everything. -How would she know what fellatio is? -Oh shit... What? I try to be really careful, but... I watch porn sometimes. Do you think Claire saw you? I try and do it quietly, but she might have. Daphné, I'm on my own all week. I'm not proud of it, but... It is better than fucking someone else. I go to bed alone and I wake up alone, thinking of you... Wanting you. And sometimes, it is hardcore stuff. -Why didn't you tell me? -Because it is too much. Too much love, too much passion. I don't want to suffocate you. Come here. GENOA- ITALY Sir, please! So... What's with the delay, Emilio? The bad weather isn't helping. Believe me. -Hi! -Buona sera. How are you? It is so good to see you. Yeah, you too. When was the last time we saw each other? -The Albanian border, wasn't it? -Yeah, that's right. Genoa is much nicer. We had to meet again at some point. Fill it up to the brim! No! Shit. What's wrong? How do you deal with the nights? What do you mean? Sexually? Yeah, you are a man who is away from his wife a lot. Do you jerk off? No. I work hard enough all day as it is! I prefer to hire an escort if I get too lonely. What about your wife? She isn't really into hookers. And they are more expensive in Switzerland. Do you miss your husband that much? And my girls. What am I doing, spending so much time on work sites? The same thing I am: waiting two years for a better paid job as manager. Two years, right. A lot of time to be in Albania. Yeah, don't worry honey, they had a good night. -Did you talk to Claire? -Of course I did! I was right. She caught me watching porn one night... But we had a good, long talk and things are fine now. And how did she take it? Really well, don't worry. Wasn't she upset about-- Daphné, everything is fine, I promise. OK? Now, go on. I gotta go too. And I love you, OK? So much. I love you too. We are here, ma'am. Could we go back? I will grab my case and you can take me to the airport. Thank you. -Ah, Mrs. Sémelin! -Hello, Isabelle. -What are you doing? -I wanted to surprise my daughters. Are you taking them to dance class? Yes. Take the afternoon off. -Thank you. See you tomorrow. -Bye, Isabelle. Bye. Bye. -Mommy! -Mommy! You came home early! My baby girl! -How are you, princesses? -Good. -Can I take your case? -Can I take your bag? Here you go, miss! Let's go! How has your week been? Good. We can bend really well now! Come on, you. Let me give you a hand, sweetie. How did your talk with Dad go? Yeah. I... made a mistake. I saw Daddy naked, and I made it up. I'm sorry for being naughty. I will never lie again. But I have to go now. It sounded like she had been told to say it. No, you can't be serious. I know, that's why I'm calling you. Do you think he is capable of hurting the girls? I can't imagine... Maxime? Doing something that awful? Daphné, you would have seen the signs. I don't know. I don't know who to believe. Look honey, I don't know what to suggest. But I'm here if you need me. Thanks. I will call you back. Love you. And, one, two three... And one step forward. Bath time, girls. What about Dad? Don't you want me to wash you? Daddy always makes us wait and take a bath with him. Since when? Get dressed, honey. -Aren't we going to have dinner? -Yes, at Granny's house. -Aren't we sleeping here? -No. Take your bags. Let's go. Here you go, sweetie. Come on. Why aren't we taking your car? Where are you going? Hey! What do you think you are doing? Get in the car, girls. Let go. Fine. You go if you like, but the girls are staying with me. Why are you doing this, Daphné? I love you. -I love you all so much... -Don't you touch me. -You are scaring them. -Get out of my way. Let's go, please. Sorry, sir. MAXIME CALLING Can you drop us off here, please? -Hello? -Mariette? -Yes. -It's Maxime. Have Daphné and the girls arrived yet? Daphné didn't tell me she and the girls were coming over. -No, she didn't say anything. -That's strange. Where are they then? Why? What's wrong, Maxime? Daphné was in Italy. She left her job without warning. She came home, took the girls, and left. She has disappeared. What do you mean, "disappeared"? Did you two have a fight? No. But you know how fragile she is. She gets so lost sometimes. She is so paranoid. That was a long time ago, Maxime. No, Mariette. I'm scared all the time. We manage to pretend... that everything is fine. I hope nothing has happened to her. I will try and call her. -Lots of love, Mariette. -I will call you back. Mom? Are we going to live in the hotel? Just for tonight, sweetie. Come here. Daddy had no right to... to ask you to do things with him in the bathtub. It is... wrong. And... he needs to get help. So... To make sure he doesn't do it again... we are going to live somewhere else. Do you understand? I want to go home. Dad didn't do anything, I swear. It is all my fault. No it isn't, honey. -Yes, it is. -No. You are just a little girl. And little girls are not responsible for things like that. -It is my fault. -No, baby. I made it up, I want to go home. I want to stay with you. I don't want to lick Daddy's fudgesicle covered in bubbles. Shut up! And Claire doesn't like it either. Come here, come here, honey. My baby girl. My baby girls. INCEST CHILD VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD ABUSE: THEIR STORY DON'T WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE SURE BEFORE YOU REPORT ABUSE Hi Mom, it's me. I need your help. I'm looking for a 3-bedroom apartment to rent. Are any free? We have been looking for you everywhere! -Daphné! -Did Maxime call you? Yes, last night. Neither of us could sleep a wink. Why on earth did you run off like that? I didn't run off. I left so I could protect my girls. Mom... Maxime has been sexually abusing them. Do you hear yourself? They came and told me. No, wait... calm down. That doesn't make any sense. That's impossible! Max... Maxime is a sweetheart! And you know kids... They have very active imaginations. Stop. They didn't imagine it. Their father sexually abused them. That isn't love. He needs to be locked up. Hang on. Everything's fine here. You can watch a cartoon, girls. And then we will have breakfast in bed. I will be back in a minute. Listen, I can't talk right now. I'm not alone. But could you just believe me, for once? Of course, but... -I don't know what to say. -I don't know, you could say "I love you" or "I'm here for you" maybe. Please, Daphné. Don't start this again... Just tell me where you are, OK honey? No. Otherwise you might tell your darling son-in-law. Thanks Mom. I will handle this on my own. Goodbye. Hey, girls. Shall we go and visit Aunt Sandrine? -What's her dog called, again? -Crumble. That's right. Is Sandrine their old elementary school teacher? Yeah. She lives in Antony. No one will think to look for you there. -Are you all strapped in? -Yeah. Crumble! Come here, little Lucie! Crumble! I want to stroke him first! Where has Claire gone? He kept telling me he loved me. He was so happy when the girls were born. I feel so dirty! Mom! Mom! Come on! Coming! -Coming. -We're coming, girls. I'm sure that... he encouraged me to go back to work so he could abuse the girls. It makes me sick. It makes me sick! I didn't see it. Sweetie, look at me. Look at me. I'm here. I have to take care of the girls. -I have to take care of the girls. -You couldn't have known. Yeah... Crumble! Hey! -What on earth happened to you? -It's nothing. You should have called yesterday! You must have had an awful night! Thanks for being here. My darling boy! I always thought that woman didn't deserve you, but to go and make up something like this... -What is wrong with her? -I don't know. -I found this. -What? In her inbox. Andreas Meyer? The guy is from Switzerland. A project manager for a big company, like her. Very convenient. She is cheating on you? They met the first time she worked over there, I think. You both seemed so happy. I thought we were. She hid it very well. Has she gone to join him? I don't know. That bitch! If she is accusing you so she can divorce you and take the girls, she will regret it, I promise. Right. The first thing we need to do is get you a good lawyer. A woman. That seems more credible. I don't know... My head is all over the place. We will sort this out for you. Your father is right. And prepare yourself to hear some nasty things. She will try and sully your name, the police will interfere. You must prepare yourself, Maxime. Don't lose heart, Max. We are here. Are you sure you don't want me to come with you? No, hon. You are already running late. Can I see your bag please, ma'am? Thank you. Go ahead. Thanks. Ma'am. Hello. I would like to lodge a formal complaint. On what grounds? Incest. My husband has been raping our daughters. Captain Grésillon? There is a lady here for you. Thanks. Have a seat. Someone will come and get you in a minute. Thank you. Do you have any witnesses to corroborate your story? Yes, my daughters. -Anyone else, I mean? -No. Do you have any material proof, photos, anything? No. I left as soon as I found out. Any sign of physical trauma? No. Unless you have proof, there is nothing I can do. I came to ask for the protection my girls need. Is there nothing you can do? Are you in the middle of a divorce? What's that got to do with anything? Mrs. Sémelin, I would like to speak to your daughters. Where are they? Somewhere safe. It is too soon for them! They are still in shock. But I'm going to need to hear it from them. Can't we spare them the trauma of being questioned? Being questioned isn't the traumatic part, ma'am. Bring your daughters to see me as soon as possible, please. OK? Goodbye. Show the lady out please, Fred. This way, ma'am. Hi, Claude. I'm prioritizing a preliminary incest investigation. I haven't met the girls, but I want to start an investigation in the case of rape by a family member. We are just coming. -Hello sir, ma'am. -Hello. Well done, girls! Well done! Hello, little beasties! My little kitty, my tigress! Turn around! Let me get a video of the three of you. Wonderful! Shotgun! Hey, little pirate. Bedtime. Bedtime. Slippers off the bed! How was your day, girls? -Fine. -Yeah? -Yes. -Yeah? Listen... You have to go and talk to someone... about what Daddy did. Because it is wrong and... and so you need to... need to... talk to a policewoman about it so it doesn't happen again. -I don't want Dad to get in trouble. -No! No, sweetie. You just need to say what Daddy did to you. -Is it really wrong? -Yes. Does that mean he will go to prison? That's not up to me, sweetie. Then I don't want to say anything bad about Dad. Please, this is important. OK. Alright. We won't do that. Let's make another video with the phone, OK? I will ask you both some questions, and you can just nod if you agree. Is that OK? Here we go. Claire, did you write that... your daddy asked you to lick his pee-pee? And he told you it was normal to do that... because you love your daddy very much. Is that true? Yes. Lucie, does your dad get naked in the bathtub with you, put bubbles on his fudgesicle, and... ask you to lick it off? Yes? He says it is just a game but... you think it is disgusting? Thank you. It's 6 in the morning, Mom! The police are here. They are looking all over for you, Daphné! -Are you OK? -Thank you. I am OK, actually. Thanks for the coffee. I have to go. -Good morning. -Good morning. You bastard! What the hell are you doing here? -Where are Claire and Lucie? -Mrs. Sémelin, I'm François Sancini, deputy public prosecutor. Hello. Two charges of bodily harm and kidnapping have been made against you. We are taking you into custody. Honey, what's going on? -I can't believe you reported me! -You didn't leave me any choi... Where are your daughters, Mrs. Sémelin? Safe. My husband raped my daughters. I expect he forgot to mention that. Enough, Daphné. Just stop it. Just tell me where they are. Call the Child Abuse Squad. I went and saw them yesterday. Do you have any proof for these claims? Yes. We will take a look at that later. In the meantime, could you please tell us where your daughters are? What are you going to do? Your husband has provided us with some information that leads us to believe you are in no fit state to take care of them. Child protection services will decide after they question the girls. -No. -Daphné... Daphné! I would advise you not to do this, Mrs. Sémelin. Get her back. Who wants to throw the Frisbee for Crumble? Where is Mom? Why isn't she back yet? How? How? How can she do this to us? She must be out of her mind! Are you sure you got the best doctor? Dr. Pelleta is excellent. Very experienced. What about the questioning? When will that happen? I hope things will go smoother. What kind of monster do they think I am? They wanted all the dirty details. The names of my ex-girlfriends, when I lost my virginity, my sexual fantasies... I feel like... It was horrible. Don't worry. You will have plenty of time to expose your wife's lies. My ex-wife. To put Lucie and Claire through all this, and the medical exam... I will never forgive her for this. Never. I want her to pay. Dearly. Mr. Sémelin, come with me, please. Fine, but... What about my daughters? They are with Dr. Pelleta. They are in good hands, don't worry. Shall we? Claire, did your daddy ask you to lick his pee-pee? And tell you it is normal, because you love your daddy very much? Lucie? Does your daddy get naked in the bathtub with you and put bubbles on his fudgesicle and... ask you to lick it off? Can we turn that off, please? It is disgusting. The children aren't saying anything. She is clearly forcing them to answer. -It is pure manipulation. -And why would your wife do that? -Why don't you ask her lover? -He is Swiss. We need a letter of request, which will take some time. -What if her anxiety has come back? -What do you mean? Daphné... Daphné has always hurt herself. She often goes off the rails. Her parents even had her committed when she was a teenager. Did she tell you about that? No. No. No, she didn't. So, you don't know your own wife? Mr. Sémelin? Could you answer the question, please? I thought I did. Shall we build a house? What is your house like? Do you know this doll, Lucie? Where is Claire? Claire is with a policewoman right now. And then it will be your turn. Come here for a second. Come here, Lucie. This is the listening doll. You can tell her anything you like. Whatever you want. She likes listening to children. Do you think your son may have been abused when he was a child? I know the theory psychologists have about abusive adults being abused themselves. But that is absolutely not the case with Maxime. He was a... sunny, sensible, bright child. Just like the man he is now. That woman is twisting everything. I hope you have the good sense to lock her up as long as possible. I know how to do my job, ma'am. -How long have you two been together? -Eighteen years. Are you cheating on your husband? Are you cheating on your husband? No. Do you still have sexual relations? Yes. How often? How often? Do you want to know what positions we do, too? Are you having any sexual relations with any other men? What is your relationship with Andreas Meyer? Is he your lover? No. Are you in the middle of a divorce procedure? Where are my daughters? You do realize that you have been brought here because you are being accused of psychological abuse on your daughters after having stolen your children from your marital home and depriving them of their second parent? That is a criminal offense. Also, you raised your hand... you punched your husband, which is bodily harm in front of witnesses, and which led to your husband being unfit to work. My husband raped his daughters and... and you are asking about dumb shit like the little slap I gave him. What the hell is wrong with you? Calm down. I don't want to add insult of a public officer. I want you to protect my daughters! It is not that hard! Just... There is a video, watch that. Do your damn job. Why are you... Do I have to do your job for you? How can you work with this asshole? Is he like this every day? Jesus! Right. Do you admit to raising your hand on your hus-- Stop asking me about that! Jesus! Hey! Sit down! Sit down! Forget it. Let's get a doctor to examine her. -Can you call the doctor? -It is fine. I'm calm now. No, we will call the doctor. Call them, please. Come here. It is OK. It is over. I'm here, now. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Follow me, ma'am. These are the lady's things. -Good evening. -Have a good evening. -Thank you. Goodbye. -Bye. Goodbye. Follow me, please. The lawyer will let us know if there is a problem. There is no need to... I know, I know, but... When it comes to incest, people tend to believe the mothers. Yeah. Maxime is a wonderful man and a wonderful father. No one would possibly believe this nonsense! Oh, my darling! We are all hungry, and can't wait to eat some of grandma's ravioli! Let's go and take care of that. -Here, give me your things. -Thank you. Knife on the right... Fork on the left. And what about these sweet little spoons, where should grandpa put these little spoons? On the left? On the right? Well, if no one will tell me, then I shall put you... here, little spoon! Here! What do you think? Very good. Right, this one is mine. I cried my heart out earlier, when the judge said I could bring them home. Those officers must come across some very crazy people... What's going to happen now? They will continue to investigate. So the girls will have to go back there regularly to... see the child psychiatrist for... I'm not sure why. Listen to me. Tell the nanny to take some time off, and your father and I will take care of the girls. The less upsetting this all is for them, the better. OK, my darling? Yes. We are here for you, my love. Come on. Straight off to bed. Right, come here, you two. Everything will be all right. We love each other, and we are together now. Nothing else can happen to us. What about Mommy? Mommy... is sick, but she is getting help. Is she in the hospital? Of course she is, because she is crazy. Go on, off to bed. Come on, let's go into the garden. It is the voice of reason. -Come on, come with me. -It is the voice of reason. Let's both go into the garden. Yes. The garden is the voice of reason. -Dad, stop! -Time for breakfast. No, stop! No! Dad, stop! No, no, no, my dear! It seems you have difficulty controlling your violent urges. I lost my temper at the police station because no one was listening to me. No one is listening now. Have there been other times when you thought no one listened to you? Probably. When I was younger, maybe. I don't know. What do you mean by that? During your anorexic phase, maybe? It is something to consider. Your parents had to put you in hospital. For five days. Just five. What are you trying to do, except help my husband, who is trying to make you think I'm crazy? Claire! Your hot chocolate's getting cold! -Here. -I don't like honey. Yeah, but Mom wants you to eat some every day. But Mom's not here! Right, great. Thanks, honey. Go and get dressed girls, please, hurry up. How are you? They won't tell me where the girls are. Do you know? Maxime has them. We found you a lawyer. He is with the doctor right now. He is doing everything he can to make sure the girls go to your mom's, or your in-laws. They gave my girls back to Maxime? Daphné, he wouldn't dare touch them right now. This is your lawyer. -Hello, Mrs. Sémelin. -Hello. I have just spoken to the doctor, and I am optimistic that the judge will soon order your release. I have brought the documents for the inquiry. The prosecutor won't be able to ignore your complaint of child rape by a family member and the aggravating circumstances anymore. Right darlings, Granny and Grandpa will come and get you from school and take you to the police station. Do you remember what we said? Girls? That we refuse to say anything. Because if you do... ? Mommy will have to stay in the hospital longer. Very good. Claire, did you hear that? That's right, sweetie. I don't understand. I thought the judge had ordered the release of my client. I am in charge of that decision, counselor. Have a seat. Mrs. Sémelin, your complaint was taken into consideration for the girls' sake. Captain Grésillon and her team questioned the nanny, the cleaner, your daughters' grandparents, the neighbors, the staff at the girls' school, their dance teacher, and even your husband's employer. They even brought two of his ex-girlfriends in for questioning to ask them about their sexual relationships with him. There is not one shred of evidence to support the charge. I'm not making this up. Just watch the video. Ah yes, the video. Something else that incriminates you. What this video actually shows is a mother pressuring two girls into saying things about their father. I would have no reason to do that. Actually, you would. To alienate them from their father. False testimony from a mother who desperately wants custody. Our courts are full of them. And I wish to make an example to stop these accusations once and for all. I would therefore advise you to withdraw your complaint, or you will be prosecuted for slander. I won't withdraw my complaint. It is up to you. In the meantime, you are free to go, but under judicial supervision. Excuse me? As I am inclined to believed you may try and repeat your acts of kidnapping or violence, you may not, under any circumstances, go near your family or your marital home before your court appearance. This decision is completely unreasonable. Then by all means, appeal. We certainly shall, Your Honor. Let's go, Mrs. Sémelin. Well, he certainly got his example. When will I get to see my girls again? Look, I'm not going to lie to you, Mrs. Sémelin. Your court appearance could take months. Just try not to make your situation worse. If the prosecutor has any proof that you went near your children, he won't hesitate. -Shall I walk you to your car? -I will be OK, thank you. -Hang in there. -Thank you. Thank you. I... I will have another. How about you pay the bill, and I will order you a cab. Thank you. Hello? Daphné? Hello! Hello! He has blocked my card. I don't have any money. You need to come and get me. Where are you? I... I don't know. Daphné, hello! Hello! Daphné! I don't know where I am. Daphné! Hello? Laurence was right to bring you here. I'm going to take good care of you. And all of this... will soon sort itself out... in time. Look, I found some old clothes of yours. No, Daphné! Don't! Don't do this! Don't do this! No! No! Yes, very good. Thank you, girls. Now go and get changed. Stop acting like you are better than us, Sémelin. The teacher said your mommy is crazy. Don't talk about my mom like that. Stop showing off! -Stop it! -Don't talk about my mom like that! There you are! What? What is it? What is wrong? Hey, sweetheart! It is all torn. You shouldn't have hit her. You always lose your temper. That's not fair. Right, girls. Go and have a wash. Are you taking a bath with us? No, you can have one on your own, like big girls. OK? And I will make us pizza. Would you like that? Yeah! Yeah, great. I need to speak to you both. What do you want? You shouldn't be here. Please. We have nothing to say to you! Lili, please. -Come in. -Thank you. Why do you keep trying to tear our family apart? So you can go off with another man, is that it? Why don't you just ask for a divorce and leave my son alone! You used to love him, remember? Maxime was my whole world. -I have never looked at another man. -Liar. Say what you like. I don't actually care what you think. All I care about is the safety of my girls. So until the judge decides a verdict, take Claire and Lucie to your house. They love you. Maxime won't refuse them that. You are asking me to say to my own son that we are taking his children just in case his wife is telling the truth about him sexually abusing his daughters? At least give me the benefit of the doubt. Get out. If you dare to come back here, I will call the police, and I won't hesitate. -Get out! -You are his accomplices now. Get the hell out of here! Mrs. Sémelin? Right, I won't lie to you: we were hesitant about letting you back in. You made a huge mistake by up and leaving in Italy like that. Luckily, your superior managed to pick up the slack with our clients, and Laurence convinced us, thanks to your previous good results, -to give you another chance. -Thank you. Are you sure you are capable of traveling again? There is nothing for me here at the moment. Hello, sir. -How are you? -Fine. How are you holding up, son? It is tough being a single dad, but I'm doing OK. What about the girls? They don't really speak about their mother anymore. It doesn't mean they have stopped thinking about her, but... Of course. Speaking of which, I was thinking. We should accept her lawyer's proposition, and allow her to see the girls for a few hours now and again. With one of us there, of course. We wouldn't want her to influence them. She is their mother, after all. Plus, all the psychologists claim that there is nothing worse for a child than... having their parental bond disrupted. -What do you think? -I think that's a load of crap. And you are giving up on me. During the hardest time of my life. That's not it at all! No... I am just trying to be... reasonable. Reasonable, Dad? With that toxic headcase? Listen carefully: I will never let that woman see Claire and Lucie again. Understood? Well, you are their father. Exactly. Oh honey... you kept that? Claire, listen. I hate to tell you this, but... Mommy doesn't care about you. About any of us. Lucie, come here. Come here, sweetie. Mommy came out of the hospital today, and she didn't even tell you. -She didn't call? -No, sweetie, she didn't. Your mommy has gone off with another man. What's wrong? It is strange. We know our children by heart when they are little. But later, we realize we don't know anything about them. We don't recognize them anymore. Maxime has become so rigid. I'm not surprised, with everything he is going through. Maxime isn't a stranger. Don't forget that. You come near me, my daughters, or my parents again, and I will kill you. Go ahead, kill me. At least then they would take the girls away from you. What are you going to do? Everyone knows you are insane. So, what was it? What's wrong? Tell me! What is it? It's... It was Maxime. What about Maxime? He just attacked me. I'm calling the police. It would be his word against mine and... I'm not as clever as he is. So we are not going to do anything? No. No, we are. -Where is she? -Downstairs, waiting for you. Oh, sweetie! -Are you OK? -Yeah. This has got to stop. The guy is sick. You need to be more careful. I'm not scared of him anymore. I'm going to kidnap the girls. Do you remember Corinne? The sales rep who left the company two years ago? She is in Australia. She will help me when we get there. Australia? Isn't that a bit far? We will take a plane from Switzerland out of the Schengen zone. Will you help me? Here. You will need this. Thank you, Mom. Marie, I will do the cooking, OK? -OK. -Have a nice day. I got Maxime's, too. By the time he gets a new one, we will be deep down under. What about the nanny? It's fine, she likes me. She will be pleased to finish early. Hello, darling! How are you? So, what shall we do? Can we go to the square so you can buy us ice cream? Yes, why not? -Do they sell ice cream there? -They have waffles too. -Really? -Can we get one? Off we go to the square, then! Let's go, my darlings. Off we go! Henri. -Mom? -I just need to go back into school, -I forgot something. -Mom? -What? No, that wasn't her. -Mom! No, that wasn't your mom. She isn't out of the hospital yet. No. Your mom is still in the hospital. No, she is not! Dad said she got out! -What's wrong? -My in-laws were there. Shit! Hey, instead of ice cream, why don't we have a nice hot chocolate instead? Go up to your room, I will call you when it is ready. What did that woman want? To see her girls, I expect. The judge should have never let her out. She is going to ruin Maxime's life. She told us: "I will never give up." She is always going to be there. Call Maxime. It is strange how she would risk everything to see them. I... I know, but call him. Are you sure it was her? Yes, of course I'm sure! Shit, she still has the keys. -Dad, can you do me a favor? -What is it? Can you look in the desk near the front door, please? Open the drawer...the right one. -Got it. -Are our passports in there? No, I can't see anything. She must have stolen them. Listen, tell your lawyer what's happened straight away, OK? Yeah, OK. She tried to kidnap them. Yes, I need a replacement for a 5 lever lock, and it's urgent. Tomorrow at 10 a.m. Perfect. We will tell the cleaner so she can let you in. We are at 28... Hang on, let me check. Élise? Hang on a minute. No, darling! Don't get my clothes all wet! Hang on, I will go and get you some towels. Élise? No! Get out! Go away! Go away! No! Go away! -Go away! -What is it, sweetheart? What's wrong? -It is just your grandpa, sweetie. -Go away! It's your grandpa sweetie, it's just grandpa! Calm down. Come here. Make him go away. Hush, my angel. The girls are playing in their room. I can't hold them in my arms anymore... hug them... show them any affection without thinking... without worrying I might be hurting them, too. Don't say that. Did you talk to her? Did she tell you what happened? Henri, her reaction might have meant anything. It doesn't mean... Come on! Are you really still defending him? Really? -We don't know for sure. -Of course we do! You know we do! Yes, hello? I want to book a cab for... 28 rue des Templiers, please. Yes, thank you. Go and get the girls. The cab is on its way. I want you to take them to ours as soon as possible... to keep them safe. But if I'm not here, you won't give Maxime a chance to explain. He is your son. Exactly. They must have called the cops by now. If they have, you need to get out of here. I can't leave without them. I know. -It is Henri, my father-in-law. -Don't answer it! Hello? Yes. All right. I'm on my way. Where are you going? He told me to meet him at my house. He swears it isn't a trap. Do you believe him? I don't know. He is an honest man, and... -he says it is for the girls. -Daphné, please. We just arrived home. The girls are safe now. Listen, Think about this. You... You can't tear our son's life apart based on suspicion. At least wait until you have proof. It might not be what we think. Wait and sleep on it. Tomorrow... we can talk to Maxime about it, together. Please. Call me back. It is very quiet here. Where are my favorite girls? Are you OK? Are you feeling alright? How could you do that to your own daughters? What are you talking about? Did she come back? Did you let her get to you? Where are the girls? They are not here anymore. They are safe now. You will never touch them again. You bastard! You disgust me. I can't even look at you! Are you going senile? Where is Mom? How long has this been going on for? How long? Come in. I don't want her in my house! This is her house, too. And I asked her to come. I'm sorry for not listening before. I... I am so ashamed. So ashamed of my son. Dad! This woman is insane. You are the one who needs help. Did she trick you? I have supported you this whole time. You made me your accomplice, and I won't stand for it anymore. Do you hear me? This stops now! Now, either your turn yourself in, or I will. Stop it! Stop. What are you going to do? Your daughters will hate you... for the rest of their lives. Hate me? What are you talking about? My daughters... love me. More than anything in the world. And I'm the one... who loves them the most. Do you realize what you are saying right now? -Do you hear yourself? -Yes. And I will say it again. My daughters... love me. Hello? Yes, this is Henri Sémelin. Yes. I wish to speak to Captain Grésillon, please. It is urgent, very urgent. Thank you. Yes, Captain. My son wants to talk to you. Can you come to the house? We will wait here. Mommy! The notion of incest was only introduced into the penal code on March 14, 2016. 4 million people in France are victims of incest, according to the International Association of Incest Victims. Only 10% of victims dare to break the silence and report the act.
