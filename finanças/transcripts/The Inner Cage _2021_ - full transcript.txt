As a child, I often went hunting with my older brother. Once, I must have been 13 or 14 years old, I asked him if he would let me carry his rifle. He gave it to me With a thousand recommendations. I was happy, I felt important. At some point, about fifty meters away, skimming the trees a turtledove passed by. I closed my eyes, I shot. Then I didn't understand anything more, my arm just hurt. I hadn't killed her, though, I had only hurt her. My brother would have killed her on the spot So that she wouldn't suffer. I instead I took her home to cure her. Every day I put her a little penicillin on her wing. Because you had a delicate soul. And you are an asshole. Cicada, you are an asshole. "A delicate soul." "What's up, then? - Nothing, however, we had a good time. - Heh. - There were a lot of ducks. - Yeah. - Sanna? - Wasn't he with you? That one is ashamed To return without anything. Definitely, because earlier he had said. That he was showing us how to hunt ducks. Yes, now when he comes back let's take the piss out of him. - He gets pissed off. - It's normal. - Have a beer. - He goes hunting with a gun... - To waste bullets. - Come on. - Ready? - Yes. Let's have a toast. - To the closing of Mortana. - Yes. - To friendship. - Cheers. - Health. - Cheers. - Oh, Sanna. - Oh. Anto'. - Is everything all right? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Show us this game. - How many did you catch? Seven, eight? - Don't listen to him, have a beer. Give me a beer. - Franco, do I give it to you? - But yes. - Give me 'this beer. - Inspector. In my face! How did you do it? How, he went to the butcher this morning. Coletti, I don't miss a beat, didn't you know that? Now you know. - You don't miss the ass you have. - Eh. With your ass you don't get them, look at the wonder of it. - Then let's roast it. - I'll take this one home. Tomorrow my wife will make meat sauce For pappardelle, my dear, And you on an empty stomach. Here's to it, what's good Of Mortana's closing Is that I don't have to see you guys fight every day. - Cheers. - Cheers. I am a serious person, I also have a son. But who believes that? Say rather that if your wife finds out about you, she'll kick you out of the house. Gaetano, Tiziana is a smart one, you stopped being a butterfly. Friends are friends always. - It's back home! - Especially in time of need. It's coming home! Gaetano, the director wants to talk to you And to you, too, Sanna. - To me? - Yes. And also to Coletti. - Now? - Yes. - What happened? - Let's go. Coming. He arrived tonight from the ministry. At the Albegna prison. They closed some departments. They cannot accommodate our 15 inmates who were supposed to go there. - That's 12, doctor. - Better. Until we find for them a placement, these 12 here have to stay. - And so what? - And so it doesn't close. How? The 96 destined for other institutions Will leave as scheduled. Albegna's 12 are to stay here. Gargiulo, you, Sanna, Coletti, along with a dozen officers, you must stay. Why us? What is this, a punishment? This is an emergency, Coletti, it's a few days. Doctor, how do we in 15 control the entire institution? You gather them all in the Rotunda, to the new joints. - What. - So you have them under control. - Do you remember that there is also Arzano? - Arzano as well. Keep the blindo closed And in case stroll separate. Gargiulo, you will have to take the lead. He is the most senior and has the right experience. With you will remain Buonocore For all that is paperwork, bureaucracy and possible expenses. - Why, doctor, are you leaving? - I have to. Tomorrow at the Calanques I have the handover And I have been assigned Frenno prison. Gentlemen, it can be done, that's 12 inmates. Also because all activities are suspended. The commissary and kitchen are closed. For the meals, a company will bring from outside the already cooked food. We forgot the interviews, doctor. Those are suspended as well, of course. How long do we do we keep them without family visits? Inspector, If they know that they will be transferred soon, they won't want to bring families all the way here. It's a few days. Meanwhile, I continue to urge the ministry. Send. Manda. Send. Send. Goodbye. Give to me. Come on, one quick thing, let's not lose the day over a suitcase. Couldn't we wait in our cells for the transfer? You don't make the decision, Cacace, and you're not in the hotel. Nuzzo and Puddu, cell four. - Come on, Mazzena, quick. - Oh. Mamadou and Jhamal, cell three. - With Arabs, niggers and gypsies I'm not in. - Shut up. - Silence. - Oh. Bertoni, one word and you go into seclusion. Tahirovich and Georgiev, cell seven. Fucking gypsies. You will find someone to break your horns, Bertoni. But who understands you? - Silence. - Shit. Now go to cell one, alone. Walk, come on. Leaf and Jasmine, cell eight. Thank you. Come on, Leaf. Lagioia and Cacace, cell two. Inspector, there is nothing in this cell, not even space to put the stove. It's only a few days, Cacace. Don't even waste the scotch to attach the pictures. All right? Mazzena, do you have to do the housework? Here. You get the bricks from the caterer. Unfortunately, I have already raised the walls, otherwise I would take advantage of it. Not much of a restaurant, but you can eat. Rat and potatoes, do you want it? What is it, Gaetano? Do you want my second? I see that you like it. - Manda I'aria! - Walk. - Manda! - Come on. - Quick, come on! - Walk. Walks. - Send, send. - Come on! Wake up, come on, were you sleeping? - Move! - Come on! Pretend that nothing is happening, the guard is watching you. - Do you have the money? - I have it. Quick. - When did the director call? - Half an hour ago. She said That we have to keep it, Then he will go with the others to Albegna. The prison slowly we fill it one more time. - Good evening. - Good evening. Fantaccini. That you were homesick for us? What did you do this time? Do you want to tell your colleague What did you do? You can go, we'll take care of it, thank you. Take the handcuffs off him. Fantaccini. All right? - Go with the colleague who searches you. - Already searched, he's clean. From here on it's our responsibility. - Who's signing? - I'll sign. - Good evening. - Good evening. Take off the belt. Empty your pockets And put everything on the desk. Of money only this much do you have? This is the list of your things, sign here. You sit in that chair And wait. Here, put these on. Here are Fantaccini's possessions. - Where did we put him? - At the one with Bertoni. No, he's better off on his own. Five is empty, isn't it? - Yes, it's empty. - Then we put it there. You put it in your cell. Let's go now. Fantaccini, what are you doing? Unroll the mattress. Open. - Don't close. - Don't piss me off. Go back, come on. Bertoni, therapy. In front of me, Bertoni. - All right? - Good. Cacace, therapy. Thank you. But why is cell six staying closed? It's none of your business, Lagioia. Inspector. Inspector. But when will you open up for me? The educator used to make me wash the office windows to be quiet. Of course, Jasmine. When we open, we'll have you clean something. - Thank you, inspector. - Take care. Inspector, is there any word about this transfer? When do we leave? Where are they taking us? Even if I knew, I couldn't tell you, Cacace. How long do we have to go without the visits? We have to notify the relatives. The transfer order can take place even tomorrow, you already know that. Yes, but the kitchens are closed and we have to continue to eat this crap. Easy, we all want to get out of here. It's tough being in jail, huh? You're in jail, I'm not. Oh yeah? I didn't realize that. Let's be funny this morning, Lagioia? For goodness sake. No laughing matter here. Exactly. Inspector, the old man next door is sick, he's been complaining all night. I told the inspector on duty, but nothing. Inspector, I tried to call him, but he doesn't answer me. I can't take it anymore, I want my family. - I want to get out, I want to go home. - Arza'. I can't stay like this. Arzano, can you hear me? Pressure is good, inspector. Then I can go home, doctor. They are waiting for me at home. Arzano. Why are you located here? I don't know. Where are we here? In the barracks. In the barracks? What barracks? Carabinieri's. Carabinieri Barracks. What day is today? - Thursday. - Yes, good. Why are you here? I don't know. The marshal brought me. Yes, whatever, but why? Boh... How many children do you have? Do you remember? - Rosario. - Then? Larger. Cyrus. And Lina. And that's it? - What happened tonight? - Nothing. - What do you mean "nothing?" - That's faking it, Gaeta. - This bastard makes me sick to see him. - Franco, we know who Arzano is. The problem is figuring out if he's sick. What do you say, Buonocore? Is he sick or is he faking it? To know whether he is faking, I would have to be a magician. Those like him lie, they always lie. Let's call a doctor, it will be his responsibility. Ours has a new assignment, do you think they send us another doctor? - Do you guys spread the word? - Yes, we'll take care of it. We tell everybody. - Thank you. - Count on us. Arzano. Lean against the wall, otherwise you will fall! Bertoni! Bertoni. Hands are held in pockets. - Who says that? - I says. Oh yeah? - All right. - No, it's not okay. It won't happen again. Vitto. - You can smell it. - Silence. Give me, give me, that I'm hungry. Go. Tie, Berto, eat these too, infamous! Get the fuck out of here. Fantaccini, leave the trays in front of the cell. Proceed. - Pass. - Go away. Leave the trays on the ground. Proceed. Go, that not even dogs eat this crap! Trouble ahead. - They are refusing food. - Really? - What does that mean? - They left the trays on the ground. First the Italians, then the foreigners. Gaetano, let's step in. And to do what? We force-feed them? - Who is there now there? - Mancone and Spada. Your food is the same as ours. - We eat the same things. - You say. We don't eat this food, because it sucks. Listen. In a few days you will all be transferred. But when? Oh! Quiet! So! Hey! The transfer order may come tomorrow as well. For each of you, arrive at new destination With the weight of a revolt on your shoulders is certainly not a good thing. Even for you it is not a good thing, if we continue to refuse food. Lagioia. How thoughtful you are. You don't have to worry about us. However, you know very well How some things turn out. No? - Are you threatening us? - No. I have to report, though. Then in the report also put in. That in this prison all activities are suspended, there are no more interviews And the inmates refuse to eat because the food sucks. It's hunger strike. Silence. All right, whatever. Fantaccini, pick up all the trays And bring the cart back. But what is it like? The principal didn't bother to come down? The principal comes down When there is a need. Now there is none. Open. However, let's wait for a response. I don't have to give you any answer. Little slave, this Fantaccini. So, Gaeta, what do we do? What do we do. We wait and see. And what more do you want to see? The shit that goes up to our heads? These don't hold on anymore. Today the food, tomorrow another shit. They have also realized it That no one is leaving here. If they also refuse dinner, we decide what to do. I'm going to the barracks. I don't want it, pass. Pass. Go. What's going on? They also refuse dinner. Bertoni also Who had eaten at lunch. One way or another, they convinced him. What should we do? Should we call the director? Wait, Buonocore, calm down. Let's not run. - Open two. - You got it. Lagioia, summoned to management. What do you want to do to him? Why are you taking him alone? So, Angelo, are we going to move? - But to do what? - Too many questions you ask, move. What's going on, Cacace? Nuzzo, take care of your own problems you. - Where are you taking him? - What do you want to do to him? So, Lagio? What do we want to do? But the director is not in? It is better for you If we resolve the situation Before the director arrives. - Thank you for the kindness. - Be less of a joker, Lagioia. The meals these are. - We have to stay a little longer. - How little how much? Little. You guys stop messing around And what happened today didn't happen. No report. Open the kitchen, let us cook. - The kitchen? - The kitchen. The kitchen is closed. The inmates who were working there have all been transferred. I will cook, I volunteer, there is no problem. The kitchen Is in the area of closed wards. No way. Ah, then I was right. You don't have enough men to control us. - There are four cats left. - One more provocation and you regret it. I am looking for a solution For what I can do. You have to take care of the rest. I have to pee. Are you taking me back to my cell Or can I use your bathroom? Now you've busted my balls! What? It disgusts you That an inmate is using your bathroom? Then take me back to my cell. Mazzena, accompany the detainee to the bathrooms down the hall. What a piece of shit. I think That we have to call the director. The warden runs two prisons. We 12 inmates. I don't feel like we are handling them, Gaeta. If Lagioia comes here and dictates the rules, they're in charge. - Let's hear, what do you propose? - I don't have to propose anything, Gaeta. I propose to treat them according to the director's command. We must avoid a revolt, this is our duty. How? By dealing with that shit? It's dangerous, Gaeta. A clever one. He evaded capture dozens of times As his men fell one by one. Gaeta, let's stick to what the director said. A couple of days of fasting And they reconsider. I say that Lagioia it doesn't pay to fuck up. He's at the end of his sentence. He is not a fool. - Goodcore, willingly, can it be done? - What? - What is the state of the kitchen? - Until the day before yesterday it was operational. Gaeta, but... That's a "puppeteer." If we give in on the kitchen, we put the strings in his hand. Then how do we do it? Do we already struggle managing the shifts or not? You guys don't have to worry, I'll handle it myself. - I'll go with him. - Where? In the kitchen, I'll go with him. - You by yourself? - By myself. All right, Gaeta. So, Buonocore? I'll call the company tomorrow And see if they can bring us some raw. I think there is no problem. Lagioia, please inform your comrades that starting tomorrow the kitchen will be back in operation. You do the cooking. Oh. Very good. That's better for everyone. We don't need your approval. Take him back to the cell. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. So, Lagio. Here are the vegetables. I put the meat in the refrigerator. Then there is the pantry And take what you need. Then there's the cutlery. Here and here. Ladles. Knives fit here. The inspector has the key. I operated the refrigerator, everything works. In the freezer there are sandwiches. Gaeta, that's it. Go ahead. With all these onions I'll make a genovese with them. Now it takes a knife. Now comes Fantaccini to help you. But who, the little boy? It's better not to have clumsy people around. If you have to bring me someone, let me come Cacace That at least I know he can help me. Lagioia, you cook. We decide who comes to help you. Inspector, good morning. Did you call me? Come on, Fantaccini. Stand next to Lagioia, he tells you What you have to do, so you learn how to cook. Here, put this on. You can go. - Can I cut the onions? - Never mind, that you cut off a finger. Fantacci', take a knife. Take, take what you need. Yes, yes. If you whistle, you don't cry. At the group home I was taught this way. Were you in a group home? Why are you staying here? Mugging. Besides whistling, what did they teach you at the group home? What can you cook? I can make risotto. They taught it to me At the old family home. Why were you in the group home? Did your parents not want you? Forget the onions, I'll chop them. You peel the carrots. Here, use this. That's the quicker way. Thank you. Lagioia, it's so good this genovese. Everything is ready, young man. When you're done, you can go. Inspector, who should I serve first, your colleagues or the detainees? - Colleagues first, that's natural. - First the officers, then the detainees. When you're done, you bring the whole thing back here. We are waiting for you. Meanwhile, Lagioia is carrying on with cleaning the stove, or am I wrong? That's right. I'll show you a road Shorter, without you going around, come. Do you see that grating? A few meters later, on the left, you are standing in front of a gate. It's not closed, it's just pulled in. You open it And you find yourself in a big hallway.... Mazzena, pay attention, Fantaccini comes from the abandoned ward. Placeholder. Fantaccini, hurry up, come on in. You took your time, huh? Colleagues, it's ready! - Well, Rosario? - The smell is good. - Which ones are ours? - This is the first, that is the second. Watch out it's hot. Dishes. - With Fantaccini what do we do? - Accompany him to the section. Dishes! One could go out there... For a cigarette? Maybe you don't have keys to that door. Do I smoke it here then? - Announce the board. - Board! In the cell! Everyone in the cell! # Lagioia! Lagioia! Lagioia! # Lagioia! # - Go to the cell, come on! - Bravo! Bravo! - Put a little more meat on it. - Give it a little more poison. Don't fuck with me. Put there. Put, put, Fantacci'. Bravo. He "arrevotated" me Lagioia! Bon appetite! The Genoese is like that, she is ugly in the face. Let's hope she's at least good at heart. Inspector, you don't want her? Inspector, they called from the court. Here comes a public defender for Fantaccini. - He has to have an interview. - I'll go, thank you. - Do you want to, inspector? - Let's have a taste. Here it has never been seen that officers eat things made by inmates. Bon appetite. Cacace, distribute the lunch! - And it figures. - Open it. Fantaccini, from the lawyer, interview. Go ahead, come on! I didn't ask to talk to the lawyer. You have him explain it to you. Now that's a little smell, Don Carmine treated us well. Don Carmine can cook well. - Counsel, Fantaccini Angelo. - Good morning, Fantaccini. Have a seat. Ants. In a documentary I heard that it is not true That all ants are always working. It seems that in a colony like this there is a part that does nothing all day long. Scientists are going crazy trying to figure out the ones that don't do anything what they are for. If they were of no use at all, With evolution they would have been extinct by now, wouldn't they? You, I suspect, if you were ant. To which category would you like to belong to? Those who do nothing Or the ones who work? Let's go back in, the cigarette is finished. - Mazzena, everything okay from over there? - Yes. Fantaccini? He's in an interview with the lawyer, but he's almost finished. What lawyer? The court-appointed one sent by the court. Here, they're coming out, I'll have him come. - Fantaccini is coming towards the kitchen. - Good. Fantaccini! Fantasies! Lagio, let's go. Fantaccini! Fantasies! This way. Fantaccini, come out! If I call for reinforcements, it's trouble for you! - What are you doing? - I'm looking for him. Inspector. No one has told you that there is no crying in prison? Wipe your face. Oh, what were you trying to do? Have you gone crazy? Huh? What the fuck were you trying to do? What am I supposed to do now? Should I put you in solitary confinement? - Answer. - Enough now, you don't need to. Lagion, take a step back. Step back, I said! Go on, walk. Has Fantaccini arrived? Yes, everything is all right. We are coming back. Gaeta. This time Fantaccini a mess he made. He almost killed an old man to steal his wallet. The old man resisted And Fantaccini filled him with his fists. He knocked him to the ground, snatched his his wallet and ran away. The old man all smashed up He went back home. He felt sick. They took him to the hospital. He's in a coma, Gaeta. You have to have Fantaccini staked out day and night. What should we do? That sends an old man into a coma And we babysit him? Don't talk bullshit. Gaeta, we check Fantaccini As we control everyone else, no more and no less. I do my work, at night every two hours I check. Then if something happens is your problem. Franco. One, if something happens to the boy, the responsibility is ours. Two, you go now, take a quiet one, take Mamadou, you move him to Fantaccini's cell. And you tell him it's a job. - Gaeta, but you... - Fra'. Mamadou. Come on, come with me. - Get your things, there's a cell change. - What have I done? Nothing, but there is a cell change anyway, go with Fantaccini. I'm fine here, why do I need to change? Mamadou, can you hear me? What the fuck are you guys up to? To decide everything? I said there is a cell change, go with Fantaccini, period. Mamadou, look that one wants to get hurt. Keep an eye on him especially at night, we'll take care of it during the day. This is work, you will get paid. Agreed. What are you doing here, Lagioia? Who told you that you can be In another inmate's cell? You are right, I was just talking to the boy. Come on, get out. We found him in a cell With a piece of glass in his hand. I didn't understand. The boy had disappeared And you didn't call us? If anything happened to him, it was trouble for everyone, not just for you. There are bars everywhere there, the boy could not escape. Yes, I understand, but the issue is not here. You got help from Lagioia. Gaetano, listen. The principal left clear instructions. Suspended activities and catering for meals. We are not doing that Because we are coming after you. Do you get help By the worst of the convicts? It's better if I go in the kitchen with Lagioia. No, I'll go there. Meanwhile of all this I don't say anything to the others, Otherwise a mess will break out. I can't sleep, I have nightmares. Take it easy, then it will pass. Now get into bed. Go to sleep. Do you not see That bread is burned with fire? It's black! There is fire! I told you, you don't know how to work! I am good at working. - Get into bed. - I am good at it. Put yourself to bed. The bread is burned like this. - Inspector, what's the matter? - Go to sleep. What the... What the fuck... How... How did I shrink? I peed my pants. How is this possible? We hope that the Lord Will take me away with him, how is it done? - Arza'. - If you open me, I'll help him. My pants are all wet with piss.... Look what I've gotten myself into. What's the use of living like this? Now I'm also taking off my pants.... Come, sit down. Inspect. It is certainly not the ragout of the house, But the lump of bread inside the sauce Is always a pleasure. For me it is a childhood memory. No, thank you. I went to Fantaccini's cell. He told me all about it. - Had you asked permission from the place manager? - No. In fact, I got a big reprimand from Inspector Coletti. He got it right. That's the rule. Is it the rule? However, you also... When Fantaccini disappeared, you did not warn your colleagues. There was no need, there was no risk. However, Fantaccini He could have hurt himself. - It would have been your responsibility. - What is this news? Are the inmates now concerned about the fate of the officers? - I would have felt sorry for you. - It's a misplaced sorrow, thank you. Then I apologize to you. It was just a thought I wanted to communicate to you. Maybe this is not the time. Gaetano, we are coming with Cacace. Roger, we are waiting for you. You see, inspector... For me to go to Fantaccini's cell to give him courage was natural, Because among inmates there is this solidarity. In the compassion you had for Fantaccini I seemed to see the same humanity. Now it almost seems that it pisses you off. What is it? Can you not admit that you have had the same feelings as a prisoner? Lagion, what kind of bullshit are you talking? Let's talk man to man. You and I have nothing in common. I in the evening when I put my head On the pillow I am serene. I do my work, I get paid, my conscience is clear. I have never hurt anyone. I have no debt of any kind to anyone. This gives me a serenity that you don't know. So you and I in common We have nothing. - Good evening. - Is everything all right? All is well. Lagioia. Quick, your comrades are complaining That dinner has not yet arrived. - Shall I take the trolley? - Yes, let's go quickly. Open. Vitto. Don Carmine, what have you prepared for us tonight? Come on, I'm hungry! - Inspector, is it okay? - Thank you, enjoy your appetite. Thank you. - Light! - Inspector! Light! Silence! Silence! Silence! - Gaetano. - Did the power go out in the ward too? Yes, here too. Fortunately the inmates are locked in the cells. Only Cacace is outside with the trolley. Get him back in the cell, too. Who is there with you? Sword. There is the whole valley in the dark, but it doesn't depend on us. - It's the storm. - What about the generator set? The one on the surrounding walls has started, the indoor one didn't, there must be a problem. - Who the heck can get their hands on it? - All right, let's go see. Give me the lamp. # Fenesta vascia # 'E padrona cruel # Quanta suspire # Mm'haje fatto jettare # Mm'arde 'stu core # Comm'a 'na cannela # Bella # Quanno te sento # Annommenare. # Inspector, tell him to shut up! If we all sing, what the fuck are we doing here? - Bertoni, calm down. - Tell it to him! - Calm down, Bertoni! - Say it to him! Bertoni! You can't see anything here, we look dead and buried. Alive though. Jasmine, that's enough. # Take the 'sperience of snow # The snow is cold and if it makes you eat... # Open. # And you comme so So bitter and cruel # Muorto mme vide... # - Well? Is it resolved? - It is not known. Let's do this, Mazzena stays here, you come with me over there, let's go talk to Gaetano. Take the flashlight, enlighten Fantaccini. - Eyes open, huh. - Yes. How do you think to make us eat without light? Lagioia, we're going to fix now, take it easy. Well? Light! Light! Light! The generator set is oxidized, there is little that can be done. Here without light we are in deep shit. Totally. The flashlights we don't know how long they can last, Monitors nothing, cameras nothing. The driveway door without power does not work. We are stuck, closed. One problem at a time. The power outage Can't last forever. In the technical room there must still be battery lamps if they are charged. Yes, but how do we keep the inmates? Silence. Let's distribute the meal. Let's make them eat. How? In the dark? Gaeta, what do we do, do we give them our flashlights? - What about us then? - We put them all in the center of the ward. With two or three lamps we manage to illuminate them. I'm going to go and call the guys from the barracks, all of them. If something happens, at least we are ready. Come with me. You come with me to the ward. Light! Light! Light! To the wall, leaning against the wall, ready to intervene. Light! Light! Because of the lack of light, Tonight we will eat all outside the cells. Open. But without making a mess. Without making a mess. So let's take all the small tables And bring them to the center of the traffic circle. Mazzena, go ahead. Mazzena, Sword, open the cells and let them out. - Will you take us out to dinner? - Go, come on. Inspector, will you allow us To put all the tables in the middle? Let's make a single table. - Granted. - Thank you, inspector. Come on, guys! Come on! Well done, well done. Come. - Only these were loaded. - Give it here. Warning. Jhamal, come and distribute the bread. - Attention. - Sit down, come here. Ready. Arzano. Arza', get up, there's dinner. - That way do we have to go? - No. I'll bring you the dishes here. I leave the blind open a little bit, so some light comes in from outside. Give me a plate. Arzano. Sit among us, Fantaccini. Come there's an open seat here. Since you are the youngest, you need me today. - Is there pork? - In the meatballs? I don't know, you have to ask Lagioia, but I don't think so. At most there is dog meat. - Do you guys eat dog meat? - Don't joke, Cacacean. How touchy you are, I'm joking! Go and eat. Here you go, Fantaccini. Here, eat. - Bon appetite. - Bon appetite. Why don't you sit down And eat together with us? Yes, sit with us, inspector! Inspector, leave it, I'll do it. You're welcome. - Bon appetite. - Enjoy your meal. - Bon appetite. - Bon appetite. Eat without any worries, There is no garlic in meatballs. My father used to make them this way at the tavern, no garlic. His customers didn't like garlic. They then said that with women they stank. Bravo, so tonight some female We can kiss her too. I wanted to make a toast. What are you crazy? With water it's bad luck! But what evil? Shut up. A toast to Fantaccini. Here's to Fantaccini! To the agents who eat with us And to Lagioia who prepared this beautiful dinner for us! To Lagioia! - Cheers. - Cheers. Good, huh? Tasty. What is this doing here? He's a sucker! - Sit down. - Get out! - Go away! - Go away! Silence. This dirt we cannot accept. We can't eat with him, send him to the cell. Cacace, calm down! Here. A shit that put his hands on little girls We have to slit her throat, not eat us together. Bertoni, you are not at home here, that you decide Who eats and who doesn't eat. Here you are in jail, you are inmates, all of you. Those who disagree, can go back to their cells. Inspector. The filthy and infamous must watch themselves from other inmates. The guards Are in charge of protecting them. However, tonight the officers and the inmates Are eating together. This is something I have never seen in my life. Lagioia, you speak well, you are very good at talking. But I don't eat with these people. - Bertoni. - I'll take care of it. Is there anyone else Who wants to go back to the cell? Or can we continue to eat? It's a monster. When I'm out of here, I may not be wrong anymore. But not him, he can't change. Me as a little boy I felt like a safe boy. Smart, bright. Nothing, he had convinced me to open a restaurant in Cuba with my savings. We arrived in Cuba and... - Shampoo, the sweeping on the ground... - The money ran out. - Very nice. - Yes. The rules there are very strict. Once my wife came for an interview To bring me the package. There the package as here weighs 5 kg. It was 5.30 kg, 30 grams more. The guard took a sock and said: "Madam, you are overweight, this can't go in. " My wife said to him: "Sorry, then give me an underwear. " The guard: "Why?" "My husband has two feet and only one dick!" Lagio, what did you say to Fantaccini? That he will be all right. If the old man dies, he is put on summary trial. With the record he has... What should I have told him, inspector? That he will be sentenced to many years in prison? That will be taken care of by the judge. Why convict him twice? Inspect. What do you think, if we open a bottle of wine? And how did it get a bottle of wine here? Okay. Leaf. Get that bottle of wine. Go for it, Leaf! No, agents first. No thanks, on duty is not allowed. To those who do not drink wine, God also take away his water! Take away his water also. I raise my glass to Fantaccini, with best wishes for the trial and with the assurance that all will go well. To Fantaccini! - Cheers! - Cheers! Let's have a toast of my country. In heaven There was a very beautiful angel. The most beautiful angel in all of heaven. He had long blond hair and wings With golden feathers smooth as silk. God was very annoyed, Because the angel was vain. He used to scold him, "Just look at the mirror, so you sin. " But the angel always looked at him. When God finds him still looking in the mirror, God becomes very angry And casts him out of heaven. The angel is desperate, He flies and weeps, weeps and flies. The more he cries, the more his feathers fall. When all his feathers have fallen, the angel also falls and dies. From every one of his golden feathers That touched the ground, Like a flower a beautiful woman is born. Too bad the angel to Mortana did not pass! Oh! Jasmine, go! Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! Sit down, Leaf. Good. Now let's return the tables and stools each back to its cell. Mazzena, bring Arzano back inside. Arzano, let's go. Guys, thank you, the emergency is over. - Good night. - Go back to the barracks. - Good night. - Good night. Closing. Sanna, let's proceed with the roll call. Bertoni. Lagioia. Cacace. Jhamal. - Nuzzo. - Present. Puddu. Fantaccini. Mamadou. Arzano. Tahirovich. Georgiev. Leaf. Jasmine. - What did they say, when are they coming? - They said any minute. At 9 o'clock he has to be in the court For the appointment with the judge. They have communicated that he will be translated to another prison. - Has the inmate been notified? - Yes, by Rosario. He is there at the ward. The papers are on the table in the office. - A little optimism and you'll see. - Inspect, good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, Fantaccini. Are you ready? Yes, I didn't have much to prepare. Lagioia, Cacace and Nuzzo gave me a few changes for trial. They were very kind. Do you guys think the old man is dead? So they are coming for me? We are not required to be told anything. If the director was there, they would tell her. All they tell us is To prepare the inmate. However, they also told us That you are not coming back here tonight. So I'll know from the judge? Brace yourself. For what? Fantaccini, it's time. Good luck. - There's no need for these today, is there? - No. "A Maronna t'accumpagna." Hello, Fantacci'. Good luck. Be a good boy, eh. Gaetano, are you receiving? Say, Buonocore. The supplier cannot come this morning, only in the afternoon. Can Lagioia make it to arrange something for lunch? I'll ask him. Something of the first I can arrange, but of the second there is nothing. Unless we go to the vegetable garden We used to cultivate. It will be full of weeds, However, there might be some vegetables that have sprung up on their own. At this time there could be some chard, some salad. That sounds like a very good idea. This way is faster. This way. Qua. See here. In just a few weeks look how it has shrunk. Look at this. It's good huh. Sautéed in a pan With a little garlic is delicious. It can also be made boiled, however, it smells a little bit. When we used to make it In my father's trattoria, the lady upstairs would always get pissed off. Then she got older, she went apeshit. She would go out on the balcony and spit on The customers coming out of the diner. My father had to stay out there, Keeping watch. Is your father still alive? Yes. Old. He always stands behind -- at the checkout. Your father? He is no longer there. Ah, I'm sorry. It was the heart. It was when we left from the neighborhood To go and live outside Naples. Leaving the dairy was not a good idea. This is delicious with beans, eh. - I've never made it, but you can try it. - I'll tell you how to make it. My father in all these years Has never come to visit. Better that way. I heard from him from my brother. I have always been ashamed to tell my brother that... That one of the guards Was the son of Orestes the milkman. With these we make salad. If you want, we can go, Or else colleagues will complain That they eat late. Damn weeds. I've always hated them. I'll bring the hoe tomorrow.
