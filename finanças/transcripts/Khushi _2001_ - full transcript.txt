Hello! Madhu! I did not write this letter for you. But my friend wrote this letter to your friend. Semester holidays. He was unable to meet her. They were disconnecting the phone. My friend asked me if I could help him. - Sorry. I said of course I would help my friend. - Sorry. Sorry. But when I came here there Was a watchman.. - Sorry.

''Babu, how long will you..'' Madhu, we live in adjoining flats.. ..We study in the same college.. ..But how come we still do not know each other. Keep that aside, today we are talking here at this place.. ..alone for no reason. What do you call this? Love. - Love? Babu and Shanti's love. What did you think? Nothing. - Madhu, did you love anyone? And you? Why? Just like that. And why did not you love anyone? - I do not know. You do not know how to love? - No. No. No. So you know that? - Oh Sidhu! Please. Let us talk about something else please. - What shall I do! Bye. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. - Bye, goodnight. Bye. Goodnight, Babu. - Meet you in the college tomorrow. Ok, bye. - Bye. So.. - So.. So, thanks.

Can you give this letter to Shanti? - Ok. - Ok, bye. Oh! You did not glue this? It is that? I feared that it is something else. Very good. I appreciate your friendship. That is how friends should be. Your friend gave you this personal letter.. ..without pasting it, that shows how much he trusts you. No, there is nothing like that. You can also read it. No. No. No. - It is a Love-Letter.

Do I look that cheap? Babu's thumb.. This finger.. Not this, but his thumb.. ..tore off and bled profusely. Could he have written in that condition? No, he couldn’t. That is why he dictated it and I wrote his letter. You got it? Or do you want any other explanations? I am sorry. - Am I clear or do I have to say something else? Sidhu. Sidhu. - Just this much gap is enough for you.. You just go on and on and on. - I said I am sorry. Now start your usual apologies. - I am sorry. No, I know. I know. I know. I know about you. I know you are going to end up with this. Please. - You do one thing. Record a cassette with 'I am sorry' thousand times.. ..and keep it with you, because you need it again and again. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. - Ok. Oh no! What happened? - It seems that car broke down. What shall we do now? - Let us lock and walk. There will not be any problem, right? There will be no problem.

What is this? - A small gift. For me? It must be interesting. You can open it slowly. What is the rush! I know. I know. Astray? Beautiful. Where did you buy it? - In Taj Art Gallery. How much did it cost? - 10,000. 10,000? It is 10,000? - Ya. It is. - 10,000 for an ashtray? Because it is made of china crystal. Because of its minute art-works it costs so much. What is this Madhu! It Looks good, but still you could have.. ..bought me something else instead of this. I cannot flick ash in such a costly ashtray, Madhu. I cannot. That is why I bought it. That is the reason I bought that ashtray. Every time you smoke and flick ash in it.. ..you should remember me. You should feel like.. ..flicking ash on me. So you should stop smoking. Sorry. You want me to stop smoking? I smoke to maintain some style.. ..and you want me to stop it? Sorry, I cannot do it. If you really.. ..respect me, you would never smoke again, ok? Beautiful. Ok. Last puff, ok? Just one more. Just one more. Let me just finish this. Happy? That is good. That is good. Hi, Madhu. - Do not disturb. Exams. I am studying. Siddhu. - Do not disturb. Siddhu. This is not right. - What? What you are doing. Studying a book is not wrong, is it? I am not studying wrong questions. I am not talking about what you are reading. I am talking about what you are looking at. I am looking at the book. - Do not lie to me. You.. You looked at waist. - What! Do not act. You looked at it. - No. You looked at it. - I said I did not. I said you looked at it. I saw you looking at my waist. May be accidentally while turning pages.. ..I might have seen it accidentally.. ..but I did not look at it in that way. It is not been one minute since you came here.. ..you have not read even a single page.. ..but you looked at me at least ten times. Madhu, you are looking at me from a wrong angle. Who? Me? I am looking at you in the wrong angle.. ..or you were Looking at me in a wrong angle? Madhu, you have mistaken me. Not just now, but you have been making a mistake.. ..ever since the beginning. That day in the dance hall.. ..when I gave you that open Letter what did you say.. You said I am a bad fellow. I read others' letters. You said I am a crook, that I am a pervert, did not you? And then when I said that I wrote that letter as he had.. ..an injured thumb you apologized to me, did not you? Ok, leave that aside. Take our first meeting for example. You saw Babu's letter to Shanti in my hand.. ..and assumed that I was about to give you that letter.. ..you started jumping up and down? Did not you jump? Now that says your psychology.. You feel that you are the most beautiful girl on earth.. ..and that everyone should be mesmerized by your beauty.. ..and admire you badly. But if anyone hits upon you, you start screaming.. That is how girls' psychology is. When you are talking about me talk only about me. Do not generalize it. What do you know about girls' psychology? It is not us who keep something in mind and talk something else. At least I do not do that. Men do that. Ok, you do that. That day when we were eating fried rice what did you do? You dropped your spoon intentionally. And then you took my spoon, the spoon I was eating with.. ..and started eating with it, did not you? Did not you hide it then? What did you hide then? And the other day you said that the car broke down.. ..when it did not, you said we would lock it and walk. What did you ask me when we were walking? Who do you like most? Who do you like most? Did not you bombard me with that question? Ok, leave that aside, a few days ago when your father.. ..came here, and when you were introducing us to him.. He is Sunder, studying maths, my college-mate, my friend. He is Babu, studying physics, my class-mate, my friend. She is Madhu, studying maths, my college-mate, my friend. You could have said it just like that. Why did you falter then? What were you hiding then? All these days you have been hanging out with me.. ..even after knowing all that, what should I call that? Tell me. Even after knowing all that you presented me an ashtray. Ok. Ok. We can call it friendship. That day when I was talking ln the college-phone.. ..when I said 'Gita, I love you' and kissed her.. ..you were dying to know who that Gita was. Who? Gita? Who is she? She is my mother. Only after telling that you cooled down, did not you? Ok, presenting an ashtray to an acquaint of yours.. ..to get him rid of smoking can be called friendship. But the pain and the possessiveness you felt.. ..to know who that Gita was.. What do you call it? Do not change the topic. Did you look at my waist or not? Did you love me or not? - No. I too did not look at your waist. It is not been even five minutes since we sat on the terrace.. ..and now I have to deal with an egoistic character.. ..who finds hundred faults in others.. I would never have such a girl as my friend. Even if she is my friend that friendship will not turn into love. Even if it turns into love it will not go as far as marriage. And if I am forced to marry that girl.. ..I would write a letter that I will not want such a girl.. ..and run away the night before the wedding. You.. - Madhu. Look.. ..you do not have.. ..any rights to talk about me or my character. I will assume that I had not met anyone called Siddhu in my life. From now onwards there is nothing between you and me. There is nothing between you and me. Madhu.. Madhu, I did not mean to.. Priya. - Yes, sir. Ravi. - Yes, sir. Sukanya. - Yes, sir. Rosy. - Yes, sir. Jhansi. - Yes, sir. Siddhu. Babu. Babu. Siddhu, Babu had not come? Madhu. - Yes, ma'am. Shanti. Shanti. Shanti. Madhu, Shanti had not come. - I do not know, ma'am. I will kill you. - Just kill me at once. I will not kill you. I will kill you. - If anything happens to Babu.. ..you will not find me alive. - You will die? Ok, die. Run away with him and dying is one and the same for me. It would be better if you die. You were born as my daughter but you do not want money? It makes me doubt your mother's character. If you meet him or he meets you he will not stay alive. From that day onwards I have been house-arrested.. ..by my father. I do not know what happened to Babu. Shanti. Shanti. Shanti, please. Nothing will happen to Babu. It is my responsibility to unite you with him. It is a promise. Siddhu. If you think that I came here to make a compromise.. ..it would be wrong. - Who said compromising is wrong! Look here. I did not come here.. Sorry, I did not come here to argue with you. I came here to talk about something important. In the last two months in our summer holidays.. ..many things took place here. Babu went to Shanti's house to see her.. ..and mistook her father as Shanti and woke him up.. ..and got caught there. Shanti's father kept her under house-arrest. Did Babu come to class? - No, he did not. The love we started is in a problem now. I mean Babu and Shanti's love. Did you see Shanti? Sorry, did you see her? I am coming from there now. Shanti had not stopped weeping. I promised her that I am there for her and that I take.. ..the responsibility to reunite her with Babu. And I came here to meet you regarding that matter. You too made a promise to your friend. So I for the promise that I made to my friend.. ..and you for the promise you made to your friend.. ..together we have to.. Together? - Together.. ..together we have to unite them. I used the term 'together'. First I have to define it well. In the coming days when we would move together.. ..we will have to decide now what sort of a relationship.. ..there would be between us. It is not friendship. It is not love. It is no other relation. Just a blind relation. A blind relationship. A relationship which has no meaning. And that relation will also end once we unite them. I hope you would not cross the line I drew. I hope I do not have to remind you again about it. You said exactly what I wanted to say. We will go and see Babu now. - Ya. Why not? Let us go. Babu, what is this beard! Two months! What! You could not control yourself for two months? What was the rush! Ok, you went to Shanti's house. And then instead of waking up Shanti.. ..you woke up her father? Hey, now stop it! That is the reason.. That is the reason I say.. ..there would be no commitments regarding Love and crap. Now Look at me how happy I am, how cheerful I look.. ..because I never loved anyone.. ..and did not get stuck in any problem alike you. You thought I would get stuck in it and suffer like you? Siddhu. It Looks stupid to put a smile on the face.. ..when there is so much pain in the heart. - What! I mean the pain that you have inside your heart for Babu. Is that so! If we put a dull face all problems will be solved? To solve X number of problems if we have to.. ..make a dull face for Y number of hours.. ..then I will do exactly that. When your dull face.. ..cannot solve any problem what is the use then? What is the use then? Babu, do not worry about anything. Concentrate on your studies. We can afford to.. ..neglect studies, but you have to study at any cost. Leave your matter to us. We will take care of that. It is our responsibility to unite you with Shanti. You do not have faith in my words? And we will not have to do it, if your Love is true.. ..then it will unite you eventually. What? If our Love Is true it will unite us eventually. Bye, Babu. - Babu, come to the college tomorrow morning. See you tomorrow. - Thanks, Madhu. You do not need to go by foot. I will drop you. To drop you, you need not be my friend.. ..and you need not be my girlfriend as well. There need not be any relation between us. You can assume that while going on road you asked.. ..some stranger for a lift and I would assume.. ..that I gave a lift to a stranger. And if you still want to go by foot it is up to you. You can go by walk. I am not staying in the flat now. I am staying in the hostel. I shifted to the hostel to stay away from a few things. No problem. I will drop you there. Fine. Stop it!

When a stranger gives me a lift I always thank them. That is really wonderful. I am going to.. Who do you think I am? Who do you think I am? You think this guy Looks like an innocent villager.. ..so you could fool him? You were not even scared of my moustache? I am going to.. Hey, where did I ask you to take me to? To Nizam college. When I asked you to take me to.. ..Nizam college you should've taken me there. But you instead of taking me there.. ..you took me around the town and at last brought me here.. ..to extract money from me? I am going to.. - Sir, Leave him. You want me to leave him? Get lost from here. Hey, do not think you can get away with it. - Sir. Sir. Sir. Come, I will drop you there. Why do you take that trouble, son? I paid him to do that job. He should take me there. You carry on. I will manage it. Sir, no one can leave till you move. Look at the traffic. Come, I will also drop you there. I am also going that way. Come. - Sir. – I will.. Please come, sir. How do survive in this city, sir! There is fraud everywhere. But you Look like a really nice person. You are a good-hearted person. You take everything with a smile. That is what I liked most about you. Son, do you know my daughter? - Who? Bujji. Bujji? - Yes, there are so many kids who study here. How would you know each one? And yes, there is a girl's hostel. Do you at Least know that? Which hostel? - It is.. Durga.. What is it? Durga.. - Durgabai Deshmukh? Yes, Durgabai Deshmukh. Durgabal Deshmukh. Well, I can never forget that hostel. There is a girl I know in that hostel.. She is not just any other girl. She is a girl with king-size ego. - What is that? Ego. - What does that mean? Ego. How do I explain it? Yes, the feeling of superiority. Even lf what she had done is wrong, she too knows that.. ..what she has done is wrong, but still she will not apologize. Even if she is down.. Got it? Even if she is down.. ..still she would say she has got the upper-hand. That is her feeling like.. How do I put this! How do I put this? Like a big bully. - Something like this. Something like this. She is a girl. She is a girl after all. If she can be that arrogant, you think I am any less than her? Sir, the building you can see there is the hostel. Thanks a lot, son. Daddy. - Bujji. How are you, dear? Are you fine? I am fine. Where is mother? - She wanted to come here.. ..but I left her back. - Why are you so late then? Do not ask me that. I had a minor fight.. ..with an auto-driver on my way here. Then a boy.. Wait. I will come here in a moment. - Daddy. Son. Son. Son. Son. Come here. Yes, I am calling you. Come here. Come here, dear. Come here, son. Bujji, I told you that I had a fight with an auto-driver.. ..and then a boy gave me a lift.. It is him. Son, she is my daughter. Bujji. Bujji? - That is my pet name. Pet name? Good. I am Siddhu. Siddhartha Roy. Come, son. Let us have a coffee. It is alright, sir. I will make a move now. - Come on. When someone comes to our place.. ..we do not leave them before they have a meal with us. At least four hens are slain. How can you leave without even having a coffee! Bujji, call him. Have a coffee with us. Come, son. - Sir, I forgot to lock the car. You carry on. I will lock it. Ok, come soon. Come, dear. Come. Bujji, I have started Looking for a groom. I came to tell you that. Is that ok? Daddy, you are always behind my marriage. I do not want it. - What is it that you do not want? I got you admitted in the college as you asked. Now you should Listen to me, should not you? Come here, son. Sit down. - I will not listen to you. You will not? Look, son. She is nothing listening to her father. Why do not you listen to your father? You have any idea what my father said? This is something between my father and me. Do not interfere in it. - Hey, I will slap you, girl. He is our guest. You should not be talking to him in that way. Look, son. What have I said wrong now? I just said that I am looking for a groom for her.. ..and she is asking me to stop it. What does it mean if a girl says she does not want to.. ..get married? It means she loves someone. Look, if you love someone, do not be afraid to tell me. I do not have any objection. I just want to see you married. But that boy must have a heart like him. What do you say, son? Do tell me if there is such a person in your life. There is no one in my life. If there is no one in your life, why don't you say yes to the wedding? Father, start looking for a groom. It is so surprising. She did not Listen to me even though.. ..I said it so many times, but she said yes.. ..after you said it just once. Son, you are really very lucky for me. You solved the auto-rickshaw problem on the way. Now this wedding problem is also solved by you. Thank God my visit did not go waste. I will also come with you. Drop me on the way. Let us go, son. Bujji. I shall go now. Let us go, son. Bujji. There is one more thing I want to tell you. Here there is a girl he knows. There is a fight between him and her. It is alright, sir. Let us go. - Wait a minute, sir. You did such a huge favor on me. How can I leave without doing something for you in return? Bujji, she is big bully. It is.. Something superior.. What was that word, son.. Was it 'mental'.. What is it? Is it echo? - it's ok, sir. We shall go now. Tell me that word, son. Tell me. - Ego. Yes, ego. She is a big bully with a big ego. Like people get possessed by ghosts in our village.. ..she is possessed by an ego. You do one thing. Talk to that girl for my sake.. ..and tell her that he is a good fellow.. ..and tell her that your father told her not to fight with him.. ..and unite him with that girl. Is that sufficient, son? Is that sufficient? Or do you want me to.. - It is enough, sir. Let us go, son. What shall we call that girl.. ..who fights with such a nice person. It's her upbringing. It is her parents fault. ''O dear foreigner..'' How can such a thing happen! She created such a big scene.. ..just because you looked at her waist? I came here from Calcutta at correct time. Now I will give you a small idea.. - What? You would forget everything. Got it! You think this is some water packet? No. It is a liquor-packet. In Hyderabad they call it 'gudumba'. If you take one packet.. - Hey, get lost! It is great. Try it. - You know I don't have the habit of drinking? So you think I am a drunkard? Will I pass out? What are you, man! Take it. Cut it. Cut it. Pour in it. Pour in it. You cut it well. Lean forward. Lean forward. Have it. That is it. It is over. It is over. Now have this. Have this. How's it? Is it spinning? Yes, you would spin. Now Look at me. Put that here. Now start a song. ''Rongoboti, Rongoboti..'' ''Rongoboti, Rongoboti, kholo kholo..'' What! You are singing Rongoboti song? No Oriya. Telugu. Srikakulum. Your father's native. Srikakulum song? - Yes, right. - You should say it clearly. ''O dear Ravanamma.'' ''There is a hand-pump near the pond.'' ''O dear Ravanamma.'' ''There is a hand-pump near the pond.'' ''By the time you return I will be in my own palace.'' ''I am a girl who lives in a palace.'' ''I am a girl who lives in a palace.'' ''And you are keeping me in a hut.'' ''O barber, O mischievous barber.'' ''O dear, come to me.'' ''O dear, come to me.'' ''There is a bus on that side, there is a bus on this side.'' ''We shall travel in a bus between them, Ravanamma.'' ''There is a train on that side, there a train on this side..'' ''We shall travel in a train between them, Ravanamma.'' I forgot the next line. - What is there! The train has left, the bus has left, the packets are also over. I will do one thing. - What? I will go and bring the packets. Till then you have a cigarette. Hey, do not forget to bring cigarettes. 'Every time you smoke and flick ash in it..' '..you should remember me. You should feel like..' '..you are flicking ash on me.' Hey, what are you staring at! Stop. You are dancing in front of me? Stop. What are you staring at! What! What! What are you staring at! Tell me. You have to tell me. With such big eyes why are you looking at me? Tell me. It is this much.. That is it. This much. Just a bit more. It is less than four inches and she says I saw it. You think you are beautiful? Such a small face, a small rat-like nose.. ..a pair of small swollen lips. And tender but attractive waist. You wore a black sari and covered your entire body.. ..a red-coloured body, Like a ripe Lemon. A ripe Lemon looks yellow. Ok, so a mixture of red and yellow.. ..which forms a romantic color. In such romantic color.. ..a small area was visible, eye would definitely fall on that. That is the nature of the eyes. You should not have exposed that part. Face is a part of your body. Waist is a part of your body. You did not get angry when I saw your face.. ..but you got angry when I saw your waist. Why? I ask you why. That is it. Now not just your waist, but I will see your entire body. You do not even deserve to stand next to me. I am going to.. Madhu. It cannot be Madhu. Madhu. Madhu. Madhu. I am sorry.. - No. Do not touch. Do not touch it. No. Madhu, it is.. - You have no right to touch this. O God! O God! I am sorry, Madhu. I came to talk to you about something very important. But now you are not in a mood to hear it.. ..and I am not in a mood to talk about it. - I am sorry, Madhu. I am really sorry. Oh no! I am sorry, Madhu. I am sorry. Madhu. My rascal friend poured liquor in my mouth even though I tried to stop it. You can drink, you can smoke, you can do anything.. How does it bother me! Who are you to me! Why should I worry if someone in this world smokes and drinks! I do not need to know why you are drinking. Madhu. Hello! You evil human, you ruined my life. Rascal. You evil human, you ruined my life. I had this wrong impression that you are a good person.. ..but now I realized that you are far greater than that. He ruined my life. - Goodbye. He came here from Calcutta only to ruin my life. Come here, son. Come here. Come here. I will kick you. I will kick you. I am so happy to see you today. My heart is overflowing with joy. Come here, son. Come here. Did she compromise? - Compromise? Not this one. Cheap quality. Gudumba costly. Stop. Stop. Is this why you came here? Is this why? Scoundrel. Scoundrel. You came here only to ruin my life. Scoundrel. - Me? ''Waist is an illusion.'' ''The world is an illusion.'' ''That is what our Vedas say.'' I thought the song is great. So I gave some music. Oh God! Oh God! Did you learn all the steps? - Master, just that one step.. I could not pick it up. - You can pick up this girl so easily.. ..but you cannot pick up a dance step. - Master. I should not reveal such secrets, right? Coming to the point. The next step is.. Everyone would lift their right leg in this step. Next step, master. - The next step is.. In this step everyone will have to lift both their legs at a time. But we would fall lf we do that. - You have to fall. That is the Latest school of dance. Hi, Mala! Hi, master. - How are you? - Fine. Carry on. Bye. - Bye. The next step is.. - Master. How did you find out without Looking back that it was Mala! The smell. It is the smell. Bad smell. You think they bath regularly? They stink. Where is this fragrance coming from? Hi, Madhu. Hold it. One moment. Hi, Madhu. - Hi, master. How are you? - Great. - Maintain that. Let us come to the point. This year's college cultural programs.. ..are nearing. From tomorrow onwards we are about to start.. ..the rehearsals. Siddhu asked everyone to practice the dance. From tomorrow you will be practicing with Siddhu. Ok? No, master. - Yes. I am not participating ln this program. - Why? I said no. Leave it there. - I am not some tea-master.. ..to leave it so easily. I am a dance-master. Do not turn me into a kung-fu master. The program you did together on stage Last year.. ..was a super-hit. Again you have to come together and.. Master, please. Please leave it there. - Ok, it is alright. Bad luck for you. Good luck next time. Raghu. - Master. - Let us do one thing. Let us put club Anita with Siddhu this year. - Ok, master. Waste of time. - Master. Yes, what again? - Who is Anita? What a stupid question you are asking. Who is Anita? Anita is a beautiful babe who joined our college recently. The moment she joined there was hysteria in the college. Every student has turned blind for that girl. - Why? An unfortunate incident took place in that girl's life. That girl had a blind brother. One day when he was.. ..crossing the road a Lorry ran over him and he died. From then on wards whenever a blind man crosses the road.. ..she holds his hand and helps him cross the road. For that one touch of her hand all the guys from our college.. ..are buying black goggles ln Sultan Bazar.. ..and moving in front of that girl like blind fellows. I am also going out on that particular work right now. She is so modern, but still has such a big heart. I shall go now. Bye. Excuse me. - Yes. Madam, can you help me cross the road? - Why? Because I am blind. - How unfortunate! Sir, you crossed the road. - Such a narrow road. What! - Anyhow, I thank your big heart.. ..for helping out this blind fellow. It is ok. Thanks. Just miss! What would I do with this now! It is of no use. Siddhu. What? - Shanti gave me a Letter. Then give it to Babu. - It is not for Babu. It is for me? - No. It is for you? - No. If it is not for you, if it is not for me, then who is it for? It is for us. - I see. It is for us. To Mr. Siddhu and Miss. Madhu. Great. It is so.. Someone glued it very strong. It is quite difficult to open it. You read it. To dear Siddhu and Madhu, this is from Shanti. No one in this world would have loved anyone.. ..as much as I loved Babu. What! You think every Lover says the same. Might be. No matter whatever anyone says love is love. Pain is pain. Please I want to see Babu. Your friend Shanti. What shall we do now? Shanti has a friend called Fatima, right? Babu, take care. - Ok. This gun had some rest after four hours fight. Shanti, you talk to your friend, I am going to bed. Shanti, who is this girl? She is Fatima's friend Farida, daddy. Dear, Farida did not see our house before, right? Yes, daddy. - Then you do one thing. You give company to Fatima. I will show Farida the house. Babu, run away. - Stop. Daddy, no. No, daddy. - Move aside. Tiger. Hey! What! - Siddhu, come. Let us dance. Move aside. Please. Thank you. I am sorry. Siddhu. Siddhu. Siddhu. Siddhu. - Madhu. Bingo, bring the car. Get into the car. Open the door. Get into the car. Move. Move. Move. Move. Madhu, are you fine? Hello! Hey, man! Who are you? How are you related this girl? - I am actually.. Ok, whoever you are. We need give her an injection. Help us out. May I? Hey, man! Not there, near waist. - Ok. No. - What! - No, doctor. Give her that injection on hand. But this injection cannot be given on the hand. Doctor, Listen to me and give her that injection the hand. The injection that should be given on hand.. ..will be given on hand and the injection that should be.. ..given on waist will be given on waist. And this is an injection to be given on the waist. Doctor, you do not know about this waist. Please give her that injection on hand. You do not know this matter related to the waist. This waist created a lot of problems, doctor.

''Who would explain us the difference?'' ''Who would clear our doubts?'' ''What is hidden in our eyes is a dream.'' ''What is hidden in our thoughts is repose.'' ''O my beloved one, are you upset with me?'' ''When the clouds collide with air..'' ''..they take the form of rain.'' ''Is that a fight or is that nature?''

You love when you feel like loving.. ..and you Leave when you feel like Leaving. You do not know how much it hurts others. Why are you talking as if you are some pure soul? You think I do not know how good you are? Did not you breathe yesterday? What! Did not I breathe? - Did not you breathe yesterday? Not just yesterday, but I also breathed.. ..the day before yesterday, the day before that.. I have been breathing since many months and years.. I have been breathing slnce childhood. You want to say that we do not have the rights.. ..to breathe as well? You asked me not to look at your waist. Ok. Now you are saying that breathing is also wrong. Am I the only one In this world who breathes? Everyone breathes. Your parents breathe.. ..my parents breathe, neither you nor l would survive.. ..if we do not breathe. Even that puppy will not survive. It breathes in one way when it stands.. It breathes in a different way when it sits.. It breathes in a dlfferent way when it runs. Right, puppy? Now If we do not breathe well how would we survive? How can you say that it is wrong! The breathing I am talking about is different.. ..from what you are talking about. - All are same. If you say breathing is wrong then everything's wrong.. ..In this world. - I will leave if you talk Like that. I do not want to talk about it. - No, you have to talk about it. About what? - About Love and pain. How can Shati go back after writing those lengthy letters? That is why we need to talk about it. My dear students, I am upset our day of separatlon.. ..would arrive so soon. If you come to me one by one.. ..I will give you a sendoff. Gita, come. Take care, dear. Sangeeta, you come here. Take care of your health. Anupama, come here. Take care. Next. Get lost. - Master. You are stinking. How long has It been since you took a bath? Get Lost. Anita, you are also Leaving the college? You would be breaking so many hearts. And yes, you used to say 'I Love kids' a lot. Yes, I love kids a Lot. - I am always ready.. ..to father those kids. - Naughty. Babu, what is this! - Siddhu, they fixed Shanti's wedding.. ..on the 27th. Here is the invitation. What shall we do now? Uncle, Shanti is nowhere in the house. What! She is nowhere. - We searched everywhere. We could not find her anywhere. Babu, Shanti's father is coming this way with his men. I will go and stop them. - Siddhu, how can the wedding.. ..take place in your absence? It is not important if I am here or not.. ..but the wedding is more important. - But, Siddhu.. There is no use talking to you. Be careful, Babu. Bro, what are you doing? - Eating coconut. Come. Hey, Chotu Motu, Lift the gate. Brother has not given me permission. Go away. Who is your brother? Lift the gate. Who is your brother? - Brother, they are screaming at me. ''The fishes in the hand were jumping out of the hand.'' ''I slashed those fishes ln two pieces.'' ''I will cook those fishes for dinner.'' Hey! - Brother is here. - What is the matter? With those beards and moustaches.. ..you are scaring a kid? - Hey, you! Do not shatter my mind. Open the gate. - Shatter your mind? You have a mind? Hey! I am telling you. I am telling you. If you do not open the gate I will cut you into pieces.. ..and throw you in the drain. O brother, your voice is scaring me. What is that body and what is that voice? They do not gel well. Go and repair your voice. Get Lost from here. Next. Hey, you! - What? - Who are you? Hey, you do not know brother? It is our misfortune, brother. It is our misfortune. We have to give our own Introductions. Ok, carry on. World-renowned poet Ravindranath Tagore.. ..Jagadish Chandra Bose, Subash Chandra Bose.. ..Amartya Sen, Satyajit Ray, Bagha Jatin.. ..Swami Rama Krishna Paramahama.. ..Swami Vivekananda, Swami Yogananda.. ..Char Mazumdar and the one and only.. ..Royal Bengal Tiger Siddhu Siddhartha Roy. We are all from 'Amar Bangla'. That is why I tell you my friends, get lost from here. Please. Did you get it? Hey, you dogs! You cannot open a gate? You are playing games here? Hit him. Hey, let me warn you. If you listen to me and leave.. ..I will spare you, or else.. I know Life is taxing and death is relaxing. Let me Liberate your divine souls from your stinking bodies. Salim, get him. - I will cut his leg. Salim, say him with the sword. Slay him. Get him. Get him. Wait a minute. I do not get anything. I told you to repair your voice first. You did not get it? I do not fight people Like you. You got it now? Good boy. No. No. No. Boss, one minute. I have got nothing. I do not want to fight you. You got it? - Then why did you come here? To play marbles? Hey, I could slash your shirts and hair without hurting you. Taking your Lives Is not too hard for me. But I am not doing that only because.. ..I know the value of Life. - Are you scared of a kid? Hey, you know who I am? Gudumba Satti. Gudumba Satti. You can be Gudumba Satti, you can be anyone.. ..but I do not care, because I am Siddhu Siddhartha Roy. Now tell me how difficult it is to kill someone. You guys do not know the value of life. By killing people you might think that you are.. ..big shots and Leaders. A pistol that was In your hand a minute ago.. ..is in my hands now. I could have taken their lives.. ..just like you do, but I know the value of life. Your wealth, power and influence.. ..might be helpful to take a person's Life.. ..but they are not enough to give someone a life. Sir, I told you earlier as well and I am saying it again. Babu is not just an intelligent guy.. ..but he is a good-hearted person as well. If Shanti marries a person of her choice.. ..there will not be any problem. Do not ruin her wedding with blood and murders. Sir, you are an elderly man. I need not tell you all this. When I can do so much for my friendship.. ..why cannot you do a little bit for your daughter? I said whatever I had to say. Now it is up to you. Before I cross the temple gate you can kill me.. ..and take her away.. Hey! What is your name? - Bengal Tiger Siddhartha Roy. Siddhu, I liked your guts. For your friend, you are even ready to sacrifice your Life.. ..which shows that he is a worthy person. Siddhu, take me there. I need to bless her. Buddy. Come, brother. - Welcome, uncle. I knew uncle Gudumba, that you would change. Give me that gun. That ugly gun. You are a dangerous guy. Hey, uncle! Why are you so hot-tempered! I told you earlier as well.. Babu, do not worry. The auspicious time is passing by. Tie the nuptial thread. Pass me few. I am so happy for you. - Thanks. - Bye. Bye, Madhu. - Bye, Madhu. Bye, Shanti. - Bye, dangerous kid. Bye, uncle Gudumba.
