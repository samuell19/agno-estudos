In 1822, a few impoverished farmers and day laborers from the village of Kombach wanted to put an end to their misery and get rich by planning a robbery of the mail truck with the Electoral Hessian tax money. According to contemporary excerpts of the official records by the criminal court secretary Carl Franz from Giessen, the plot to rob the mail in the Subach unfolded as follows: In the fall of 1821, Jacob Geiz was mowing near Biedenkopf, the meadow of Mr. Strapp, the postmaster there. I said, "Stiff grass short!" That is a lawn and not a hay meadow. It can't be any shorter. If I cut deeper, the stones will break my blade. I'm paying you for that! A new blade? I can get another one. I'll manage. Cut this short above the ground. That it becomes a lawn. Stockings! Stockings! Stockings! The stocking merchant David Briel from Dexbach, who was just passing by, went to the day laborer and spoke to him as follows: Look, Jakob, I know a means by which we poor people can be helped. If you and some other trusted people would agree with me. You know that every month the little money cart drives with tax money from Biedenkopf to Giessen. We will attack it together, take out the money, and if we succeed, then we will be secure people for the rest of our lives. We will attack it on Hessian soil, because then the Elector of Hesse will have to reimburse our Grand Duke for the money. If this means a new tax is announced because of this, it can cost at most two to three kreuzers for everyone. That wouldn't be painful to anyone. And we would be helped forever. Jacob immediately found willing participants in his father and brother Heinrich. Soon Johannes Soldan and the day laborers Ludwig Acker and Jost Wege joined them. In the night of Christmas Day they went to the forest of Grossdorf and after six hours of walking over high mountains overgrown with trees and bushes and across eerie defiles they reached the Subach, about 30 kilometers away, which they had chosen as the place of the crime. Where is it? Where is it? It didn't work out because of the snow. David, do you want some? Some of your soup would be nice. He who shall not steal, shall not steal. That was a sign from God. And he who has nothing, shall have nothing! Amen. You were afraid! Nothing else! You guys were already as white as cheese when you left. The snow would have covered the tracks again. It snowed all night. Nobody could have followed you. Patience. The money cart goes twice a month. It won't snow all the time. Patience, patience. Johanna is right. You be quiet. What will happen to you when it comes out? You're a soldier. Your punishment will be twice as hard. Just make sure no one gets killed in the ambush. A man who dies like that has no peace in his grave, and goes around as a ghost. You don't dare anyway. In Upper Hesse, serfdom was abolished only around 1820. But instead of any kind of freedom, it brought only additional debt to the small farmers, whose land holdings were too small to live on. Kept in deep ignorance by the authorities for centuries, it was impossible for them to penetrate the real causes of their misery. Only in emigrating to the new world, in poaching or in all kinds of crazy treasure hunts did they see a means to remedy their poverty. They are coming! Hide! Ho ha! Damned fools, where are you! I thought you were giving the sign! Oh, damned fools! Aren't you up there for that! You always want to decide everything! Damn fools! But there were two soldiers! Form up! Damn fools! If he doesn't give a sign! Let's go, we've got work to do. The old man also says, "Give a sign." Call to the conscription of the year 1819. To the conscripts of this year from Biedenkopf, Wolfsgruben, Kombach, Eckelshausen, Fronhausen, Hufenau, Fischbach, Friedensdorf, Nora and the appendant villages, the call is issued to present themselves for military service and to be present on June 18 in the morning for the drawing of lots and the examination in Gladenbach in front of the schoolhouse. Why are you looking so gloomy? I have promised to marry a girl from Offenbach. I am only a few hundred guldens too poor to be able to fulfill my promise and be a completely happy person. I might have some advice. I am in the same situation as you. I also have a two month old brat. Both of us could be helped by a very simple scheme. It depends only on you. I'll go along with that. What do I have to do? Don't you sometimes accompany the little money cart from Giessen to Gladenbach? Yes. You will pull the lead out of the rifleman's shotgun every time, so that none of us will get hit. And when you escort the wagon yourself, you will let yourself be captured without any resistance. Are you going to rip them off? You'll get your share of it. If you only had it already. We tried it last week, but there were two riflemen with shotguns. Yeah, I was there that time. Because there was so much money that time, the damsel tax from the marriage of our Princess of Hesse-Kassel. But next time, we'll take it. I'll go along with that. When we have the money, I'll buy myself a suit of velvet and silk. Then I'll go to the cities and let myself be served in the noble inns. And there I'll eat like the rich people. A plate for the soup, a plate for meat, a plate for vegetables, and one for potatoes. A glass for red wine, a glass for white wine, a glass for water and a small glass for brandy. And then people will look at me, and they'll say, "There's a rich man sitting there." And they'll all be friendly to me and bow. After Heinrich had assured himself of the complicity of the accompanying rifleman Volk, the chronicle writes: "Nothing now stood in the way of the execution of the enterprise." Hey! No! Bastard! What's the matter with him? Leave it! No! There's no money on it, this time! The box is empty. Yes, there is! Giddyup! 10% of the population of Hesse emigrated to the New World in the 19th century. Often whole villages dissolved. In the petition of a baker's journeyman from Allendorf is written: "Without any prospects, almost any clothes and no daily bread anymore, I, my wife and both children stand here in tears, and realize that in Europe there is no salvation for us. Must we continue to live in sin? If only I had never gone to Offenbach to serve. Then I would never have seen you in your red uniform. Now I have the brat, who will continue to live in sin. The good Lord won't pay any attention to whether the Amen is said about the pumpkin or how he was made. -Right, Johannes? -You want to kill it! What? Don't speak its name until it is baptized. Otherwise it will suffocate! That would suit you! -You're crazy. -Really? Stop it, you'll make me another one. "Here in America, milk and honey flow. For the cows graze on fat pastures all year round. And bees are found in abundance in hollow trees. You can keep as many cattle as you want. You don't need to fetch fodder for them. Only in winter, morning and evening. And the land is so good, you don't have to fertilize it in twenty and thirty years. And you can plant it or sow it every year, and it's plowed only once. That's sufficient." "It's not like Germany here. Where one must pay the little, which he won by the sweat of his brow, in taxes and dues and surcharges. Here the farmer is also master. We eat more meat than you eat bread, and drink more coffee and wine than you drink water." "Bill Vauquet, 1821." You can say anything on paper… On the night of the Saturday before Easter, after a six-hour march, they met in the Subach where they waited for the wagon during the day to now finally fulfill the deed. The recruits! Jost Wege! Young Jost Wege was saved from further participation in the crime by a recruiting measure of the Grand Duke. The others, however, could not attain because of the many recruits who were near the wagon at that time, and had to leave without having achieved anything. There they go. There they go. It will never work. How many times do you have to try something before you get there? How many times do you have to do it before it works? How many times do you have to do it before it works? Yes, that's the way it is. Takes a long time. How many times do you have to do it before it works? How many times do you have to do it before it works? How many times do you have to do it before it works? Yes, yes, that's the way it is. It takes a long time. You're the youngest of the old Lind. I know you. Jost Wege is to be your groom. That's right. And you are Acker's Ludwig and were a day laborer in Biedenkopf with Heinrich. Who has the child from the marriage. Yes. Heinrich. I saw you together. When it rains in May, you can make a wish. It will come true. I know a wish with which I can fulfill all of them. Hey, there goes the money cart! Damn it. The fifth time, they got lost in the fog by the Lahn river and missed the money carriage again. As a result, some of them decided to abandon the matter altogether. I'm going back to Offenbach. I'd rather stay a soldier. I'll go with you. -Me too. -You stay here! It is useless. It doesn't work. If it did, others would have done it long ago. So it's over? That's how the Lord God saved us from sin. Till the field, stay with the plow. Till the field, stay with the plow. Then you will benefit the world enough. Then you will benefit the world enough. From you, the benefit can have… From you, the benefit can have… …the poor, like the rich man. …the poor, like the rich man. Therefore, only cultivate the land… Therefore, only cultivate the land… …for surely many a beautiful woman… …for surely many a beautiful woman… …is made beautiful by the farmer's diligence. …is made beautiful by the farmer's diligence. Many a king is crowned… Many a king is crowned… …by the yield of the field. …by the yield of the field. Merciful God, who has the elements and all creatures in your hand, and at your good pleasure order all things, who make sinners hear your voice with terror, spare, O Lord, those who fear you! Look graciously on our supplications! Stop the terrifying thunderclaps, the harmful fires of the clouds, the impetuous north winds and harmful downpours. Let the windstorm change to your praise and glory. Johannes, you take care of the wedges. Five times God has saved us from sin. Everyone must realize that he does not want it. Go if you want to. I'm not going anymore. Then you are not our son-in-law any more. Do you think the others will get us through? Every day will bring its own. You're crazy. How will you pay for the fruit? The fruit is only paid for in the fall. And how will you pay for it in the fall? Pious sayings. A farmer in debt is a lost man. One borrows six when the earth yields only three. The interest will be higher than the debt. The house is staked, the cattle and the harvest ahead. And in the end, the gendarmes come and put us on the doorstep. The interest has consumed everything. That's how you become a day laborer. Isn't that right, Jew? That's how it is. I wish I'd been drawn by lot. Then I'd be gone. And then I could do the dirt alone. But when death stretches me, there you are to inherit. Inherit what? Debts. Be quiet, Johanna. Jacob, Heinrich and I leave the house at ten o'clock tonight, we turn around the village and don't get on the road until we reach Tautie. We go past Gladenbach into the Subach. Ludwig Acker goes with David von Dexbach and with Soldan via Buchenau and Fischbach. If we walk all night without stopping, we will be in the gorge by noon. It will protect you from saber thrust and bullet shot. Tie it under your shirt. Merciful God, who you has all elements and creatures in your hand, and at your good pleasure order all things, who make sinners hear your voice with terror, spare, O Lord, those who fear you! Giddyup! Attention! -Rifle! -No powder in it! Get down! Scoundrel! Like this! After him! Come on, he can't get out! He's trying to escape! Pull him down! Come on! Have mercy on a poor man who has done nothing to anyone! Let me go! Have mercy on a poor man! Shut your mouth if you value your life! Let me go! I have done nothing to anyone! I'm just a poor man. François, take the driver away. Scoundrel! If you scream, you'II get a bullet in the head and die instantly! You're tired of living, you rascal! Heinrich, Jacob, Volk, Acker, Soldan, David, Geiz. Heinrich, Jacob Volk Acker David Soldan Geiz. Heinrich, Jacob, Volk, Acker Soldan, David, Geiz. Heinrich, Bring out the bride! Bring out the bride! What do you gentlemen want? Here is Heinrich Geiz. My brother wants to pick up his bride! -Is it her? -No! Satisfaction with his condition! By Christian Fürchtegott Gellert You complain, and feel the discomfort, of the rank in which you live poorly; You strive to become happier, and see that you strive in vain. Yes, lament! God allows the tears; But think back also in the lament. Is the happiness we desire, for us always a true happiness? Never does rank, never do goods give us men contentment. The true peace of mind is virtue and frugality. Enjoy what God has bestowed upon you, gladly be deprived of what you do not have. Every rank has its peace, every rank has its burden. God is the Lord, and his blessing he always distributes with a wise hand; Not as we would wish, but as he found it beneficial for us. Come, come! Come on, go on! Come on! Again! It follows you all your life, when you do such a service. Nobody wants to take you into service later. So they say, "Look there! That's the one who tends the geese." And if someone takes you out of mercy, you get bad pay and bad treatment. They'll always say, "That's enough for the gooseherdess." It won't be that bad. I've been told lots of stories about how a gooseherdess became queen. Maybe I'm the prince for that? No, it's Jost. Madame, how splendidly the world is arranged! People have set a house, and chairs, and benches, and tables, and a kitchen, with a stove. Fire burns in it. There they have coffee and milk, and sugar, and a cake, and beautiful dishes. They have prepared everything for us. It's just like in a fairy tale. The Wishing-Table, But a cudgel out of the bag is also part of it! And the Gold Ass. Without that, we would have nothing. In the meantime, the news of the mail robbery had reached Giessen, and it was Criminal Judge Danz, who was given the task of investigating the perpetrators. The good knowledge of the place, the tying of rags, the disguising of voices, and especially the bloodless manner of execution indicate that the mail robbery cannot be the work of stray hordes of soldiers or other gypsy vermin, but the act of peasants of the surrounding area. Considering the poverty of the local peasants, especially the drought and the meager harvest of the previous year, and further considering the tax collection on the occasion of the copulation of our beloved Princess of Hesse-Kassel, one comes to the conclusion that any kind of monetary expenditure must raise concern. Therefore, all buyers who pay for livestock or fruit with cash at the surrounding markets are to be surveyed as to their financial situation. …surveyed as to their… The peasants will not be able to avoid showing or exchanging at least a part of the money acquired in such a criminal way. Even with the greatest caution, their poverty will not allow them to keep these treasures hidden. You can drink brandy. I am so poor that I cannot go to the innkeeper in the Wetterau. The Grand Ducal Criminal Court of Upper Hesse in Giessen offered a reward of 300 gulden for information leading to the discovery of the mail robbers, with the assurance that the name would not be disclosed. Three hundred gulden? That would help me for the rest of my life. Josef and Heinrich Hembus from Friedensdorf announce the following: They and some others, who had been fishing on the Lahn on the aforementioned Sunday, had encountered five guys they didn't know at the crack of dawn. One of the guys called out, "Who's there?" And when they answered with "Good friend", the same had answered they shall not presume to approach, go home at once, and tell no one that they had met someone here. Between the rivers and waters you offended the country's splendid privilege. Since you have obediently reported it, regardless of the consequences for yourselves, we will let mercy go before justice. and refrain from bringing charges against you. There will be no right for a reward. Indications, both true and false, began to accumulate. Most of the testimonies came from the village of Kombach, which is about 30 kilometers away from the site of crime. Schmitz Josef von Allendorf… The court decided to send Criminal Judge Danz there and to examine indications on the spot. Although many persons seemed suspicious to him simply because of all kinds of expenditure, he still had misgivings about dragging them into criminal investigation, but the low wealth of the suspects did not allow him to believe in a legitimate acquisition of the cash perceived from them. The day laborer Bertram von Wolfsgruben, a very poor person, is said to have lent 60 thalers, a certain Acker von Kombach 50 gulden. Testimony of Hans Fischer from Butzbach, a day laborer. The already mentioned Hans Jacob Geiz from Kombach is said to have bought a carriage, for which he paid ten guldens. It was incomprehensible to everyone how he had managed to do this, given his notoriously poor financial situation. Outside stands an old woman who does not dare to come in for fear, but has important things to bring to light. Show her in. He copulated. What did she say? That he got married. Heinrich, the son of the old Geiz. Yes, after the mail cart was robbed. And there was a meal at the wedding like at rich people's. Maybe his father paid for everything. No, he had nothing. He always went poaching with his sons. That's still no proof. Yes, it is. At his turn the Bible dropped on the floor. The woman means finding the truth by turning the key. If someone… If something was stolen from someone or if damage was done to him, then one finds the culprit in the following way without fail. One takes a house key, puts it in the middle of the Bible, ties it so that one can hold it with both index fingers and calls the names of those whom one suspects. At the name of the culprit, the Bible moves and falls to the floor. To the next person. And the reward? Money was promised, Your Grace. Three hundred gulden! All people want to be happy. If they were rich, they would be happy too, most people think. They think happiness and money go together like the potato plant, the root to the plant. How mistaken they are. How little they understand the nature of people. And yet they have it before their eyes every day. The holy scripture says that all things serve for the best to those who love God. And so it is. Money is and remains money, but the hearts with which it comes together are so very different, therefore from the different marriages of heart and money grows such a different life, and according to this life money brings happiness or misfortune. It depends on the heart whether one becomes happy or unhappy through money. One powder horn. Two powder horns. One gun. A bullet mold with lead. A silver watch. Whose things are these? Mine and my sons, Your Grace. The shotgun I inherited from my father. The pistol was bought by Jacob in Marburg many years ago. It is the same one with which the robbery was committed. The yellow rings over the barrel correspond to the description of the shooter Hamann, whom you badly mauled during the robbery. Such pistols always have yellow rings over the barrel. There are more of them. In Kombach and everywhere. Why do you need this arsenal? There are thieves and robbers here. Whose watch is that? Jacob's, Your Grace. Where did he get it? He won it at a shooting match, Your Grace. Where was he on the Sunday before Whitsun? As far as I know, at home, Your Grace. Your answer deserves no consideration at all as a man swore in a solemn act that he had come to you on said Sunday and did not find him. A man from Allendorf, Schmitt Josef, to whom I am indebted, came to me on that Sunday and asked for me. But because I had no money to pay him, my wife said I had gone to Wallau to deliver a cow, Your Grace. Where was Jacob on that day? And the others? In the morning he was at pasture, in the afternoon I don't know, Your Grace. Can he prove that he was at home on that Sunday? -No, Your Honor. -Take him away. Hans Jacob Geiz, you are said to owe the Baron von Breitenbach zu Breitenstein four hundred gulden. From the time of the bondage. Yes, Your Grace. Where were you on the Sunday before Whitsun? I can't remember because of the length of time, Your Grace. Do you have a watch? Yes, Your Grace. The pocket watch, there on the table. How do you come to possess a silver watch? I won it at a shooting match in Kombach. Can you prove that? Yes, with Ludwig Acker from Kombach. He had the watch shot out. How long ago was that? Three years, I believe, Your Grace. The watch has only been seen with him since Whitsun. The watch was put away, Your Grace. Fetch Ludwig Acker! Ludwig Acker from Kombach? Yes, Your Grace. Did you have a watch shot out? Yes, Your Grace. 1816 or 1817. What was this watch made of? It was a silver English watch. Was it wound on the dial or on the back? I think on the dial, Your Grace. Acker states that the watch he had shot out is wound on the dial. The watch found here is not wound on the dial, but on the back! It was as follows, Your Grace: I won a watch in Kombach, my father one in Engelbach. One of these two watches has been sold. Which one I don't know anymore, because it was put away. If it is not the one from Ludwig Acker, it must be the one from the shooting in Engelbach, Your Grace. These objects are taken into official custody. Hans Jacob Geiz, his son Jacob Geiz, and Johann Soldan, his brother-in-law, are arrested on circumstantial evidence and, forbidden to speak, are taken a hundred paces away from each other to the criminal prison in Giessen, where they undergo special interrogations. Put the bird away, the farmer is coming. What are you doing in the barn? Get out! You come with us! You are arrested in the name of the law. Don't believe the farmer, he just wants my wife! Hands off, you horndog! Poachers! The fox has killed the duck. It was already dead when I found it. Here, it's bleeding from the throat. I didn't shoot it. The farmer made a false report. He's after my wife. It's not for poaching. The order came from the criminal court in Giessen. I have nothing to do with the criminal court in Giessen. It's about the mail robbery in the Subach. Get up! Let him go or I'll shoot! After several farmers in the area, including the Geizes had been arrested, Ludwig Acker, who was not yet a suspect, decided to flee abroad. I am going to the Wetterau to thresh. I will not come back soon. Maybe never. Do you want to go with me? How can I without money? I'll see to that. No, let me. Hide this and don't tell anyone. Why did you run away from the riflemen? I'm innocent, Your Grace. Heinrich Geiz, in May 1820, in November of the same year, and in March 1821 asked the war command of Offenbach, to which he was subject as a soldier, for permission to marry Sophie Haupt, a maid there, without being able to obtain it, because he could not meet the condition of providing a sum of 200 gulden in reception money. In the summer of 1822, this obstacle was apparently removed, and the copulation took place on June 22 in Mühlheim. How did you get this money? I did not have the money, Your Grace. The war command of Offenbach waived the collection of 200 gulden in cash. They considered it sufficient that I could prove a property of 600 gulden as security. And what does this property consist of? An appraisal of my future property share in my father's estate, issued by the local council in Kombach. What is that? That is a house worth a hundred florins, an acre worth 150 florins, a cow worth 30, a carriage worth 30, an iron plow worth 20 florins, and farming implement and gear worth 30 florins. Makes a total of 350 gulden. Go on. My father promised me a dowry of 100 gulden. He paid me 40 of them in cash. 350 plus 40… 390. My wife has a share in a fortune of 80 gulden. 470. A cousin has bequeathed me 150, without my father's prior knowledge. Makes a total of 620. 20 too much. According to court taxation, the father's total assets amount to 270 gulden at the most. The house is neglected. The land is on the edge of the forest, the soil is stony and of poor quality. The carriage and implements are old. So is the cow. How can you in good conscience give a security of 350 gulden? It is worth more! The soil alone. How can your father pay a dowry of a hundred gulden, since he is in debt himself? I don't know anything about that. There is no cousin among the Geiz family who would be rich enough to bequeath you 150 gulden, nor are your wife's belongings worth 80 gulden. Yes, it is true, Your Grace. I have nothing. Then explain how you could marry so suddenly? No, Your Grace. The indicted denies facts on record and asserts contradictory falsehoods. I will not let this go unpunished any longer. I order that the collar be placed on him for 24 hours as punishment. I am a rich man passing through. Give me food and drink of the best. I am a distinguished man, passing through, I want to eat and drink from the best. I am a rich, distinguished man passing through. I want to eat and drink the best. I am a rich man passing through, I want to eat and drink of the best. There is only soup and bread, Sir. Soup and bread? Ah, also good. And wine? Potato brandy. Yesterday, October 4, 1822, the long-sought Ludwig Acker, day laborer from Kombach, appeared here in Giessen and voluntarily presented himself to the court. Do you have a fortune and what do you live on? So far, I have no assets and live off my own labor. Do you have any cash? Five gulden, Your Grace. I earned it threshing in the Wetterau. Didn't you lend money to Johannes Hartmann? No, Your Grace. Johannes expressly stated that you had lent him money. I can't understand that. Did you not entrust fifty gulden to the gooseherdess of Kombach? No, Your Grace. Both have admitted it. Will you continue to deny the truth? No, Your Grace. Then tell me where you got this large sum of money! I earned it in a day's wages. It is clear from your whole demeanor that something is weighing on your heart. It is time to give vent to it by a frank and free confession. I have to sleep on it. You blush. You stutter. How can you keep quiet about what's bothering you? An innocent man, not one easily prejudiced, can easily appear to be a guilty man. One knows what he has committed, and the other knows that he has no proof of his innocence. Why did you turn yourself in to the court? You were looking for me, Your Grace. Do you have anything to say? I want to wait until tomorrow. But if I must go in, then I must go in. Too many hounds are the death of the hare. What do you mean by that? I'm afraid of people. Why are you afraid of people? I buried money in the cabbage garden that belongs to my brother. What is this money? I'm the one who attacked the money cart. With me were Hans Jacob Geiz, his sons Heinrich and Jacob Geiz, David Bril, stocking dealer from Dexbach, and Johann Soldan. We had to try six times before we succeeded. On Christmas Eve 1821, we wanted to attack the mail wagon for the first time. However, since snow had fallen on the way there, we feared being betrayed by the trail. Now the matter remained quiet until spring, when it did not work either, because the money cart was accompanied by two riflemen. The third time we did not attack because there was no money on the wagon. The fourth time we missed each other in the fog. The fifth time we could not attack again because of many recruits who were by the wagons at that time. The sixth or seventh time, I can't remember, Your Grace, we succeeded. Thus, thread by thread, the fabric in which the culprit wraps himself in dark secrecy is torn apart, the chronicler notes with satisfaction and continues: "This is how the edifice of a scrupulous investigation is gradually built. "In such labyrinths, the judge looks for the foundation stone on which he builds. Slowly, but surely, under the hands of the master, the work progresses towards its completion and naked truth crowns his work." There is a repentance that is not really a repentance at all. Namely, the excessive repentance. Whoever has such a repentance despairs of the grace of God and commits a sin against the Holy Spirit. Such excessive repentance had Cain, who exclaimed, "My crime is greater than I deserve forgiveness!" No, such excessive repentance also had Judas, who hanged himself. They both put limits on God's boundless mercy and thus sinned more with their last deed than with their first. Judas offended the Lord more by his suicide than by his betrayal, said St. Jerome. Such repentance leads on the straight road to hell. Therefore, repent of your deeds with a true repentance and not with a false repentance. Only then will the Lord come to you. You must say to yourselves: We realize that we have violated the law and order that the Bible forces us to recognize as holy. You must say to yourselves: We see the sacrilege of our deeds and place our fate in the hands of the judges. For we want to repay our iniquities by our obedience. We no longer want to live among you as rebels and insurgents. Speak with me the confession of sin. I poor, wretched, sinful man, confess to you all my sins and iniquities which I have committed in thought, word, and deed, whereby I have ever offended you and deserved your punishment temporally and eternally. I regret them with all my heart and I am very sorry for them. And I ask You for Your causeless mercy and for the sake of the innocent suffering and death of Your dear Son Jesus Christ. May You be merciful to me, forgive my sins, and grant me the power of Your Spirit for my amendment. Amen. If you have the serious will, the firm and sincere resolution to change your sinful life, answer "Yes". Amen. Take this and eat. This is the true body of our Lord Jesus Christ, given to death for your sins. Take this and drink, which is the true blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, shed for the remission of your sins. If you also have the resolution to amend your sinful life, answer "Yes". -Yes. -Take this and eat. This is the true body of the Lord Jesus Christ, given in death for your sins. Take this and drink, this is the true blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, shed for the remission of your sins. If you also have a firm resolution to change your sinful life, answer "Yes." The Bible says that man is subject to the authority that has power over him. Yes. Take this and eat. This is the true body of our Lord Jesus Christ, given to death for your sins. Take this and drink, this is the true blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, shed for the remission of your sins. If you intend to amend your sinful life, answer "Yes". No. Our doctor Martin Luther says: The Christian submits to the authorities quite willingly, pays taxes, honors the rulers, serves, helps and does everything that is conducive and helpful to the state authority, so that it remains valid and respected, and is feared. No! -Say yes! -No! Are you saying yes now? Are you my Christian son or are you not? No. You must admit. Even I have admitted it! Say yes! If one has done wrong, it is bad! But if he doesn't admit it, it's worse! He has always been like that. These ways are necessary. No one can sleep calmly anymore if there are robbers who do not repent. You must see the sacrilegiousness of our deed! Or you'll go to hell! Say yes! No. Let every man be subject to the authority that has power over him. We only want what's best for you. You'll go to hell! You'll bleed even more in hell! Leave him alone. He will come to his senses. He has no choice. He was with the soldiers, but I repented my wrongs. Voluntarily. Me too! First! But me voluntarily. Me first! Me voluntarily! -Me first! -But me voluntarily! Me first! Me voluntarily! And me first! You must acknowledge justice. You have to regret what you have done. You must tell them. If you admit your guilt, then our grand duke will also forgive you. So I will get there little by little. I will tell them. The verdict of the Grand Ducal Hessian Court in Giessen was for the death penalty by the sword, as compensation for the costs of the investigation, the missing amount of the stolen money, with joint and several liability of the condemned. The Higher Appellate Court in Darmstadt confirmed the verdict in all its parts and sent it for the highest sovereign approval. His Royal Highness, the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, our justice-loving sovereign father and prince, gave free rein to the course of the law and approved the verdict. In three times 24 hours you will be brought from life to death by the sword. Prepare yourselves for it and reconcile with God and mankind. You bastard! The money has made me free. The peasants can't do anything with money because they have had only earth between their fingers all their lives. They can tell when they touch the earth whether it is good for potatoes, for grain or for wine. But when they have money between their fingers, they don't know how to handle it. They must not show it, because money arouses suspicion in a poor man. And the farmer cannot go where he is not known, because his land does not go with him and he is afraid of the stranger. But I am free. I have no house and no land to hold me. I can go wherever I want. The New World awaits me.

Hans Jacob Geiz. The chronicle writes in conclusion: "Ludwig Acker first climbed the steps of the scaffold, undressed himself and, strengthened by the consolation of religion, steadfastly lowered himself to the chair to receive the death blow. His head fell on the first blow. Now Jacob Geiz met his turn. Firmly embraced, he lay in the arms of his despairing father, crying aloud a heart-rending farewell. One blow ended his life. Heinrich Geiz, having arrived on the scaffold, raised his sackcloth in the air and tore it with the words: "If you tear my life apart, you too shall be torn apart!" Then he sat down calmly and died a steadfast death. Now Hans Jacob Geiz mounted the blood scaffold. Dully staring before him, he had no words of his pain. With a terrible shudder, he looked at the chair where his sons had bled to death, and then settled down on it, half unconscious. A sword stroke separated his head from the trunk.
