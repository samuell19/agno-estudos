Welcome to the Jefferson High Aquatics Gymnasium for the 2004 Girls Finals in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay. The early favorites today have to be the team of Jefferson High, with the twin sisters Callie and Elizabeth Abbott. Take your mark. They're off. Gets out to the early lead with Jefferson following close behind in lane four. They're trailed by Willow Park in lane three. But with all of these swimmers here today, it's really anyone's race. All right, they make it to the first change at the diver. Still in the lead, but Jefferson is right on their heels. Elizabeth Abbott is in the pool, and she is something else. Oh, my! She just put in an incredible time swimming the second leg. The dynamic twin-sister duo of Callie and Elizabeth Abbott are a force to be reckoned with. ♪ ♪ It's gonna be up to Callie Abbott to see if she can bring it home for Jefferson High. She's in the pool. She's coming up. In the lead, but Jefferson is pulling in close. It's neck and neck. Callie Abbott, she's coming! Oh, my! Callie Abbott! Jefferson High! They are your new champions! ♪ ♪ You owe me. Put it on my tab. When I'm selling mansions, I'll buy you whatever you want. Yeah, right! I'm not waiting that long.

Honestly, I don't know where you get it. Your mom would have drowned in a kiddie pool. You'd better not. You said I owe you. I'm smelling swim scholarships... Don't you dare! Callie, come back here. I'm Elizabeth. I'll be right back. You're not fooling me, Callie! Hi. What is she doing? Hi. Oh, my God. What's going on? This is so embarrassing. That's Ricky Davis. That's the guy I told you about. Oh, no, she's still talking to him. She's at it again, pretending to be me. Ohh! Now you owe me big time. What'd you do? Aunt Rose, Lizzie's gonna be needing a prom dress. I hate you.

What I wouldn't give for a night at home and a bowl of that mac and cheese. Hey, I will trade you the kids and all the mac and cheese you can eat for those seats. Make it Callie's meatloaf for Braves tickets. Oh, Braves ain't making the playoffs. Besides, my wife's meatloaf is pushing serious gourmet territory. Hmm, how about a Sunday-night dinner? I could use a little normal. Sounds like a deal to me, but if you want normal, I'll give you Ruby's ballet practice, a cub scout meet, and, uh, some window cleaning on Saturday. Grady seems fine. Where are my kids? It's an act. He's not happy about this weekend. Hmm. So did you go out with Jackson yet? We'll talk about it when I get up there. I'm bringing a case of wine.

Hopefully, he'll calm down. Oh, 2,000 calories in a paper cup. Thank you. Janice, uh, we got it. Thank you so much. Wait, so, uh, what are you doing here? Oh, did you miss me already? I don't know. You haven't left yet. Ouch. Well, you better get a good look because you're gonna miss me lots. Well, in that case, madame, I better take you to Les Bouquet for lunch. Wish I could, but I have to get on the road. If I get stuck in traffic, my sister'll kill me. She's been planning this trip forever. Maybe I should go with you. But fishing, worms, hooks. Ooh, and that smell. Now, if you're talking a weekend getaway in Manhattan... Oh. ...South Beach, Vegas, maybe? Mm. Ah. But, but it is your big 3-0. Jackson, most people would say, "You shouldn't have," but I'm not most people. It's... It's no big deal. Hmm. So you gonna open it, or should I add X-ray vision to the list of superpowers?

I want us all together for your birthday. Is that so bad? I wish we were going as a family, too, but I promised Elizabeth. Have her and Rose come here. We'll splurge. I'll barbecue shrimp, celebrate together as a family. I would, but it's her big day, too, and she just wanted it to be us. She doesn't have anyone. She's having a little life crisis. Right. In her luxury apartment, driving around in her Porsche, and her high-paying finance job surrounded by rich, eligible men. It's not your fault she's alone, Callie. Why are you making this harder? I didn't think that I was. Hey. Gonna miss you. Happy birthday. ♪ ♪ You don't like it? No, I love it. It's not the bracelet. What is it, sweetheart? It's not you, it's me. What's wrong, Mommy?

When you come home, I'll get my girl back. Happy birthday. Ruby's so jealous of Jed's tee-ball trophy. She asked me why they don't give awards for ballet. So sibling rivalry isgenetic. Lizzie and I don't compete. Oh, really? You were always late. And Lizzie is Miss Punctual. I just thought you were trying to one-up her. Traffic's gotten so bad. Mm-hmm. So, uh, how's Grady? Great.

And as I recall, last time you had spicy salsa was the Fourth of July picnic... where you pooped your pants? That's right. I don't know what made more noise exploding, you or the fireworks.

No way! Open it. Wow. That is quite an expensive gift. Well, how are you gonna show your appreciation? I'm not sure what he wants. Oh, I know what he wants. Just because I'm trapped in Fayetteville, Georgia, doesn't mean I don't know the ways of the world. Oh, I'd hardly call your life "trapped." Your mom and dad would be so proud of you both. Really? I'm a housewife. And I'm single and can't keep a house plant alive. Which definitely speaks "failure." You are a dedicated wife and mother with a wonderful husband and two wonderful kids. Who I really love, but I always thought I'd be the one hob-nobbing with Atlanta who's who. My life would be more exciting like Lizzie's. Oh, by "exciting", you mean the nauseous pit of regret staring at the stream of Tinder losers in your bed? Who got your motor revvin' the night before! Oh, poor you, Lizzie, the agony of $200 expense meals at four-star restaurants. With mind-numbing bores who make half-assed drunk passes at you, pretending to giggle it away for the sake of the account while fantasizing stabbing your salad fork in their eye. Oh, pity you. With a closet full of designer clothes, Chanel bags, and Louboutins. Oh, well, you've got me there. But not Loubies, Manolos. And don't forget my fabulous pedicure! Enough of this bickering before it's pistols at dawn. Now... let's eat. I know you two love me, but this is your big milestone. Why are you spending it here? You're surprised we want to be with you? No, I just wasn't expecting 2 mid-life crises at 30. Well, if it's good enough for Callie, it's good enough for me. ♪ ♪ Aww, it's our relay medals. They're all polished. I was so proud of you two that day. But not because you cheated... I saw Lizzie swim your leg... but because it showed me that you two would always be there for each other no matter what. But now that you're grown, you've got to be accountable to yourselves. Girls, you're not victims. You have made life choices. Own them. Sitting around comparing disappointments, that doesn't do anygood. What do you expect me to do? Take charge! Don't be afraid! Life's journey goes down many roads. If you don't like one, you try another. Same goes for you. You're the catch of the century. Do you really want to be alone? After your uncle died, I made that choice. I don't recommend it. Aww, Auntie, we love you. Aww, Auntie, we love you. Callie, you awake? Yeah. We should reconsider your plan. Why? We can't even fool Aunt Rose. She's known us our whole lives. Nobody else could ever tell the difference. Remember Mrs. Hanson? Oh, yeah, that was really mean of us. What makes you think being me for a week is going to lead to some great epiphany? You don't know what it's like being me. You'll find out, then you'll know. Just please, I really need this. Is that...? No way! It's for medicinal purposes. Auntie will smell it. And what, ground us? You should really be talking to Grady. I mean, according to the marriage handbook, you're supposed to tell each other everything. What am I gonna say? "I'm bored." "You're boring." "Our life is boring." "I love you, but I want more." Besides, after what happened with Avery, I... You said nothing happened. It's over. It is, but it got close. What do you mean "close"? What's so terrible about your life? I'm 30 years old living four blocks from the Dairy Queen where we were born. The only excitement I get is living vicariously through your Instagram account.
