Everybody said it couldn't be done, bringin' a wife and a child along, but Ezra had prepared himself well. The family left Sacramento in the fall of '97, traveled by boat up the Pacific coast to Vancouver, then booked passage on the Canadian Pacific Railway inland to Calgary, and north to Edmonton. Of course, that was only the first leg of their journey. They still had 1,600 miles to go yet before reaching the gold fields. But now, finally, they had arrived, the three of 'em, and it suddenly seemed that Ezra had lost all sense of time and distance. His mind could only think of the great wealth waiting for them just up ahead. Ezra was lucky, always had been, and he was countin' on his good luck to lead the family to a rich gold strike. (pleasant music) (hacking wood) Ezra claimed it was his good luck that caused them to stumble upon an old, abandoned log cabin, a cabin built by a group of fur trappers many years before. A little fixin' up and it'd be just like home. (gentle, inspiring music) Here in Alaska there's snow on the mountains all year round. Here in the summer the streams rush out of the canyons, wearin' down the rocks, washing the gold right out of the hills. When the streams finally level out, the heavy gold dust sinks to the bottom and stays there, just waitin' to be panned. Ezra seemed to be lucky, all right. Not far from the cabin, there was a good-sized stream with lots of quiet pools, perfect for the gold to settle into. He'd never been a prospector before. Matter of fact, Ezra had always been a dentist, known as Sacramento Valley's finest. But bein' a dentist, he knew what gold looked like, and how to identify it. He'd done a lot of studyin', too. Read every book he could get his hands on in order to prepare himself for a summer of prospecting. Now, Eve Lambert usually went along with her husband's wishes, never put up much of a fuss. It'd been a rough trip for her, though. And Eve was worried this time, not about herself, but for their son, Kidd. After all, Kidd was only 10 1/2, and should have been in school with other children his own age. But as Ezra explained it, this trip would be a real learnin' experience for Kidd, the adventure of a lifetime. Still, Eve worried. Kidd had no friends his age to play with and all his father ever seemed to think of was gold. Rough as it was, though, Kidd always stuck with it. He was pretty strong too, for a 10-year-old, and somehow, a friend or two always seemed to pop up. (otter chirping) - (laughs) Hi. Watcha doin'? (laughs) Hi, boy. - [Narrator] Ezra had prepared for life in the wilderness every way possible. He learned about survival by reading tales of the mountain men, plus all the Indian stories he could get his hands on. He and Kidd went huntin' together, and soon they discovered that nature provided all the food the family would need, during the summer anyway. (birds chirping) - Move quiet now. - [Narrator] Ezra had become a pretty good shot, too. He practiced for months before leavin' for the gold fields. (gun fires) - Father, you got him! - [Narrator] Eve had bought kitchen supplies the family would need in Edmonton, 350 pounds of flour, 150 pounds of bacon, 50 pounds of beans, 10 pounds of tea, bakin' powder, salt, soap and matches, while Ezra had laid in all the hardware and other supplies needed for prospectin'. He followed a list of items including a booklet being distributed by the merchants back in Edmonton, called The Little Nugget. The only items Ezra didn't buy were heavy winter clothes, 'cause the Lamberts only planned to spend the summer in the wilderness. And with Ezra's good luck, he figured they'd find a rich strike for sure within a couple of months. You see, Ezra wasn't interested in just wastin' all summer panning gold dust out of the stream. No, he had his sights set higher than that. What Ezra planned to do was find a rich gold vein somewhere in the mountains. Why fool around workin' yourself to death pannin' when you knew those little flakes of gold had to come from somewhere. While Ezra searched for the vein, he kept Kidd busy workin' the stream, and it was Kidd who made the first real discovery, a raccoon playing with a gold nugget bigger than anything Kidd had ever dreamed of finding. Kidd knew he had to follow that old raccoon. Maybe he'd lead the boy to more gold. Maybe he'd even find the rich vein his dad was searching for. - Wow. (dynamic music) - [Narrator] The only place the raccoon led him, though, was to his den, hidden in an old, overgrown tree stump. Inside the den, Kidd made a second amazing discovery. (suspenseful music) - Wow. (whimsical music) - [Narrator] Ezra was wild with excitement. Those nuggets looked about as big as baseballs to his eyes, and more important, there had to be more where they came from. - [Ezra] Are you sure this is the right stump? - [Narrator] But if the old raccoon had any more gold, it wasn't in his nest. So Ezra figured there was only one thing to do, catch that million dollar raccoon. It hadn't taken long for Ezra and Kidd to build a trap. By this time, Ezra had it figured out that the old raccoon must have gotten the nuggets from right out of the hill somewhere close by, and by the size of those chunks of gold, he figured they were sittin' right on top of a real bonanza, maybe even bigger than California's mother lode. When they catch that raccoon, they'll be rich. Ezra's good luck was already workin'. (gentle music) - There's so much gold, I tell ya, more than, more than anything we've ever even dreamed of. That dust we been pannin', it's nothin', nothin' compared to this vein. That pony you wanted, you're gonna have the nicest little pony. Them dresses, you're gonna look so beautiful. - [Narrator] Talk about countin' chickens before they're hatched, with Ezra, the eggs weren't even laid yet. But Ezra already figured he was a millionaire, and he sure liked the feel of it. 'Course Eve was happy too, not so much for the money, but just to see her husband so excited. He'd planned this trip for a long time, and now it looked as if everything was workin' out just like Ezra had promised it would. Why, they'd only been in the Yukon Territory for a couple weeks, and already they were well on their way to havin' the riches Ezra had always dreamed of. (gentle music) Eve was happy for another reason, too. Now the family could return to their home in Sacramento, and Kidd would be back in school come September. It seems Ezra's luck took a sudden drop, though. A baby grizzly bear cub, separated from his mother and lost in the woods, smelled the raccoon bait. (mischievous music) The bear cub had already gone several days without eating, and was feeling pretty weak by now. (bear bellows) It took all the strength he had just to figure a way of gettin' inside the trap where dinner was waitin' for him. Meanwhile, Ezra was still havin' his own dinner, and countin' his gold. (bear bellows) You can imagine how Ezra must have felt that evenin' when he and Kidd returned to the trap to collect their million dollar raccoon. - What happened? (bear bellows) - [Ezra] What's that? - [Kidd] Where are you going? (bear bellows) - [Narrator] There he was, a baby bear cub so weak from hunger it was all he could do just to look up at his captors. Ezra was mad as a nest of hornets, but Kidd took a real likin' to the cub right off, so Kidd promised his dad that he'd fix the trap and catch the raccoon himself, if Ezra would just let him keep the bear for a day or two until he was strong enough to return to the woods. - [Kidd] He's on my team, let's keep him, Pa. - [Narrator] That night, Kidd discovered just how hungry a baby bear cub can get. The bear finished off 23 jelly sandwiches in nothin' flat, and still wanted more. So Eve fixed him some warm milk with bread crusts thrown in to try and fill him up. Ezra, meanwhile, had already turned in for the night. His dreams were all about the gold he knew he'd find, just as soon as he laid his hands on that raccoon tomorrow. - [Kidd] Hey, did ya have enough? (crickets chirping) (whimsical music) (bear bellows) - Hey! Get down! - [Narrator] Next mornin', Kidd was up before dawn, fixin' the trap. He wanted to spend as much time as possible gettin' to know his new friend. As it turned out, the cub was a natural born ham. He'd do anything for one of the cookies Kidd had stuffed into his pouch, so the boy had no trouble at all gettin' the cub to perform. (Kidd laughs) - That's it. (laughs) (bear bellows) You know, you're always pokin' your nose into everything. I'm gonna call you Pokey. - [Narrator] Yep, Kidd and Pokey hit it off real good, right from the start. Now Ezra had told Kidd to get rid of him, but Ezra also had instructed the boy to spend the whole day searchin' for the old raccoon, so Kidd decided it wouldn't hurt any to take Pokey along with him. After all, when it comes to raccoon huntin', four eyes are always better than two. (adventurous music) - [Kidd] Wait for me, wait for me, Pokey! (gentle music) - [Narrator] Kidd figured the logical place to start lookin' for the raccoon was down at the stream, where he'd spotted him in the first place. But it turned out that Pokey wasn't exactly a lot of help. That grizzly cub was curious about anything and everything, a natural-born explorer, and nothin' ever seemed to escape his attention. Pokey had never really been alone in the wilderness before. His mother had always kept a close eye on her cub. Just exactly how he got lost, Pokey didn't know. Pokey and his mother had gone on a huntin' trip deep into the woods. She took out after a deer and didn't return. Finally the little cub's stomach started to growl so badly he began to wander around lookin' for food. Next thing he knew, he was hopelessly lost. No tellin' what would have happened to him if he hadn't stumbled upon that raccoon trap and been rescued by his new friend. - [Kidd] Hey, where you goin'? Come on, you can't catch a fish. You're too small to fish. You'll drown. - [Narrator] Yep, Pokey was full of curiosity. Now he had his eye on one of those big, fat trout, since he was always hungry. But if Pokey wasn't a hunter, he sure as heck wasn't a fisherman either. - We'll catch a fish later. (Pokey bellows) Hey, where you, where you goin' now, Pokey? (adventurous music) - [Narrator] Like most youngsters, Pokey didn't feel he needed a bath, either. Kidd was just playin' around, though, and it was easy to see that both of 'em were havin' the time of their lives. They weren't makin' much progress in findin' the old raccoon, though, and pretty soon, Pokey got the old urge to go explorin' again. Out here in the wilderness, there's practically always somebody keepin' an eye on you, like a hawk, for instance, sittin' in a tree, just watchin' our two friends havin' a good time. (Pokey bellows) Pokey and Kidd didn't even know the hawk was there until the bird came down for a closer look. Next thing you know, Pokey nearly stepped in the wrong spot. (rattling and hissing) (suspenseful music) - [Kidd] No, Pokey, stay back. - [Narrator] Kidd managed to get Pokey away from the rattler just in time, but then the boy turned right around and nearly grabbed a bushy-looking little animal he didn't recognize, which turned out to be a porcupine. (whimsical music) (Pokey bellows) This time, Pokey's warning saved Kidd from gettin' stuck. (gentle music) - Hey, Pokey. - [Narrator] Finally, Pokey and Kidd got themselves into a real mess with a hungry cougar hot on their trail. (apprehensive music) (Pokey bellows) - [Kidd] Hurry up, get up there! He'll kill us, hurry up, hurry up! (cougar growls) Dad! Help! Dad! Dad! Dad! (gun fires) (cougar growls) Wait a minute, ow! - [Narrator] Ezra was not happy with Kidd for keepin' the bear cub, so he sent the boy back to work pannin' the stream, and that's when Kidd made his biggest discovery. (dynamic music) - Here, boy. Here, boy. I got him, I got him! - [Narrator] Ezra was mighty happy to get a hold of that raccoon. - Okay, boy, go find that gold. - [Narrator] Real quick like, he devised a leash for the critter and waited for him to head for the gold. The dynamite, pick and other supplies Ezra might need were loaded onto a travois by Kidd. (banging) (lively bluegrass music) - Kidd! Hey, hey, slow down, take it easy. There he goes. Come on, Kidd, keep up! Whup! - [Narrator] Once the old raccoon took off, Ezra's heart jumped a mile. At last, he was on his way to a fortune. - [Ezra] Hey, slow down! - [Kidd] Dad! - [Narrator] The problem was it soon became apparent that the old raccoon was in no special hurry to lead the prospector to his gold mine. Almost seemed like he was takin' Ezra and Kidd on a wild raccoon chase. - (groans) caught him, got him, got him! Come on! Kidd! (bouncy country music) Go find us gold, boy, the gold. Come on, Kidd, keep up with us. (lively bluegrass music) - [Narrator] Ezra was gettin' mighty impatient by this time. He figured that old raccoon was playin' some kind of game with him, and he didn't like it a bit. (birds chirping) (apprehensive music) - [Ezra] Now listen, I'm givin' you one more chance to find that gold. You better be right this time. (suspenseful music) - [Narrator] At the same time, Kidd was havin' his troubles too. (dynamic harp chords) (exploding) (Kidd breathes heavily) - The raccoon got away. Go check our supplies. Come on. Here, boy, come on. - [Narrator] The dynamite blast spooked that old raccoon so badly Ezra was just about figurin' he'd never find him again. - Here, boy, here, boy, here, boy. Here, boy, here boy. Here boy, here boy. - [Narrator] And then Kidd saw it, a vein of solid gold thick as your wrist. - Wow. Dad! (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Gold! (upbeat country music) Gold. With every swing of the pick, that wood rang loud and clear in Ezra's ears. Gold. More riches than even he'd ever imagined. They say if you can see any visible gold at all in the rock you're minin', you've found a real bonanza. (Kidd grunting and hacking) (Ezra grunting and hacking) What Ezra and Kidd were diggin' out were solid nuggets, no rock to it, just pure gold. They say when a man strikes it rich out here, real sudden like, somethin' snaps between his ears. He gets a different glint in his eye. And even though Ezra didn't even realize it himself, a mighty big change was takin' place. - Ezra? Now that you have enough gold, are we gonna be goin' home soon? The winters are gonna set in soon. If we don't leave we're gonna die. We've got enough gold to last us for the rest of our life. Ezra, what's the matter with you? You've changed. You don't care about yourself, think of Kidd and me. - No! (wistful music) (pleasant music) (wind blowing) - [Narrator] Here in Alaska, the only thing you can predict for sure about the weather is that it's unpredictable. Sure enough, the first snowfall came early that year. (birds chirping) (laughing) (Pokey bellowing) - [Narrator] One good thing about Ezra findin' gold was that it took his mind off gettin' rid of Pokey right away. Gave Kidd a chance to do some more explorin' with his new friend. Now Pokey had never seen snow before, and he just loved it. Felt good on his feet, made him want to get up and go, anywhere, just so there was somethin' new to see. Now they say that bears by instinct are supposed to want to go and hibernate. But not Pokey. For some reason, he had no intention of just goin' to sleep all winter and missin' out on the fun. Then all of a sudden, Pokey discovered trees. - Where you goin'? Hey! (adventurous music) (Pokey bellows) - [Narrator] Once cold weather set in, it was rough takin' a bath until Kidd discovered a hot spring fallin' into the stream up camp. (upbeat country music) Ezra was still hung up on just one thing. His mood had changed, too. The bear cub was really startin' to get on his nerves. (Pokey bellows) So Kidd kept Pokey away from the cabin as much as possible. - [Kidd] Where you goin' now? - [Narrator] Which was all right with Pokey. He loved the forest, especially the trees. - [Kidd] Hey, don't go up so high. - [Narrator] Yep, Pokey became an expert climber, so he could race right up any tree in the woods. (lighthearted music) (Pokey bellows) - [Kidd] You'll fall! Quit goin', you'll fall. (Pokey bellows) Hey, don't go up so high! - [Narrator] But when it came to climbin' back down again, that's where he always managed to get himself into trouble. (Pokey bellows) Kidd was afraid Pokey was gonna fall and hurt himself, and it's a real wonder he didn't. Pokey felt really ridiculous, gettin' himself in an embarrassing spot like this. Up till now he'd been sort of showin' off a little for Kidd, lettin' the boy know that he could really take care of himself here in the wilderness, just like a grown-up bear. Now gettin' stuck like this had blown the whole image. Little Pokey knew he looked pretty darn silly right about now. - [Kidd] Now see, you're stuck. (laughing) - [Narrator] Finally, Pokey make it back to Earth again. The weather was really unusual that season. Summer was just now endin', and autumn about to begin, and yet there'd already been one big snowfall. Now the temperature suddenly dropped again. The lakes were freezin' over solid. Even in Alaska, it's strange for winter to get such an early start. (gentle music) Of course, Kidd and Pokey didn't seem to mind at all. To the bear cub, that icy lake was just one more place he just had to explore. Pokey discovered the ice was slick and really fun to slide around on, once you got the hang of it. Of course he wasn't too graceful, but everyone knows ice skatin' takes practice. Finally Kidd decided to try it too. - Hey, it's my turn! (lively bluegrass music) Ow! Woo! Ohh. Woo! Whoopie! ♫ There's snow on top the mountain ♫ And there's ice on frozen streams ♫ It's all a winter land of wonder ♫ When you discover what it brings ♫ An adventure ♫ Where you can let yourself go ♫ Where there's sliding on ice ♫ Or rolling in snow ♫ There's love to find in nature ♫ And in everything that lives ♫ The amount of love you treasure ♫ Depends on how much love you give ♫ Your heart turns love into gold ♫ And brings the young - [Narrator] When Kidd got back to the cabin that evenin' he was in big trouble. Ezra was mad again. Told the boy that bear cub had to go. (Pokey bellows) Seems Ezra wanted Kidd to stop all the playin' around and help him work in the mine. Ezra was afraid it would snow again and that the deep snow would keep him from gettin' any more gold. So Ezra took Pokey away, to get rid of that pesky bear once and for all. - No! (Pokey bellows) (Kidd cries) - [Narrator] Ezra led Pokey to a spot far away from the camp. The little cub knew somethin' was wrong, but didn't really understand what. - [Ezra] Okay, you stay right there. - [Narrator] Pokey also had a strange feelin' about this place. He didn't know it, but Ezra had brought him right back into his mother's range area. You see, grizzly bears, like most other wild animals, each have a certain region that they call their own, where they fish, hunt and finally in the winter, hibernate. It so happened that Pokey's mother was just over the hill. (wistful music) (Pokey bellows) (suspenseful music) (bear growling) (Ezra screaming) - Ah. (Ezra screaming) (bear growling) - [Narrator] Pokey's mother had been lookin' for her cub for many days. She probably would have killed Ezra if it wasn't for the fact that she was more interested in bein' sure her baby was all right. Ezra's condition was very serious. He couldn't even walk, which meant that now the Lambert family had no way at all of gettin' out of the wilderness. If it snowed heavily again, before Ezra regained enough strength to travel, they all would surely be trapped here through the long, Alaskan winter. (melancholy music) (wind blowing) That night, another storm left another 10 or 12 feet of fresh snow on the high mountain country. Luckily, the snowfall wasn't as heavy as it could have been down lower, where the Lambert's cabin was located. (gentle music) It was enough snow to make it tough on everybody, though, includin' Pokey's mother, whose instinct told her it was not yet time by nature's clock to take her cub and herself into hibernation for the winter. Now she must find some food to fatten up Pokey for his long winter sleep. Unfortunately, with the lake frozen over, her favorite fishin' spot was impossible. (bear growls) It didn't help matters any to have intruders drop by, like a hungry grey wolf. (apprehensive music) Mama grizzly bears will take on any stranger they feel might be a threat to their cubs. Even though the wolf is a vicious fighter, he can never begin to match the ferocious power of a 700-pound grizzly. (growling) Winter in the wilderness of Alaska is tough on all animals, man included. With Ezra injured, the big job of finding food for the family became the responsibility of Kidd. (gentle, determined music) That 10-year-old boy was made of pretty stern stuff. He'd proven that time and time again. But he'd never actually gone huntin' before, and although he'd watched his dad track down game in the woods many times, Kidd had never even fired the flintlock rifle. (gentle, uneasy music) (bird chirping) (gun cocking) (bird chirps) (gun fires) - Ah! - [Narrator] Kidd decided it wasn't quite as easy as it had looked. Must a used a wee bit too much powder that time. But, you live and learn, they say. That old bird had landed in the snow and was just watchin' Kidd to see what he'd do next, (bird screeches) when all of a sudden, the old hawk showed up lookin' for a meal of his own. (suspenseful music) (hawk screeches) (dramatic chord) It made Kidd mad that the old hawk moved right in like that and took away his bird. (gentle, majestic music) (gentle music) Matter of fact, Kidd was so riled up he just completely ignored the little rabbit. All the boy cared about was gettin' even with that sneaky hawk. (apprehensive music) Sure enough, the hawk saw the rabbit and took off for another meal. (dramatic music) So Kidd decided to scare the feathers off that greedy bird (hawk screeches) (gun fires) (uplifting music) (Kidd laughs) - [Kidd] Boy, we scared him, didn't we? Now you go home, little fella. Go home where it's safe. - [Narrator] After Kidd saw that old hawk swoop down and kill his bird, I guess it kind of turned his stomach to the whole idea of huntin'. Hungry as the family might get, the boy just couldn't bring himself to shoot the little rabbit. He loved animals, and deep down inside him, I guess he must have felt that they had just as much a right to be there as he did. Maybe even more. After all, this wilderness was their home, and they had their families to provide for too. (gentle, determined music) Things weren't lookin' so good for the Lambert family. Ezra wasn't gettin' much better, and the flour and bacon and beans had run out. Somehow, Kidd had to find some food for his family. He tried to talk his mom into lettin' him go for help. Kidd figured that he could ride the family pack horse out to the Hudson Bay Fur Post to bring a rescue party. But his mom knew the snow was deep in the canyon, and the trail icy and treacherous to follow. There was the danger of avalanches in the canyon, too, plus the fact that their pack horse was old and sick and probably too weak to make the long trip anyway. So Kidd decided to try what he knew best, fishin'. (gentle music) Many a summer he'd spent his whole vacation swimmin' and fishin' along the banks of the Sacramento River, layin' in the warm sun. Why Kidd and his best friend Gary Travers have even built a raft once and pretended they were Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. But all of that seemed a long, long way off about now. (gentle, determined music) With what little food was left, Eve tried hard as she could to keep her husband alive. Somehow, in the heart, Eve knew that if Ezra lived through it all, if the family ever got out of the wilderness, that Ezra would be a different man. - There's something today. - [Narrator] Sometimes it takes a terrible experience like this for a man to come back to his senses, get out from under that awful sickness known only as gold fever. (wind blowing) (hopeful music) The weather was gettin' colder, and Kidd was findin' it tougher than ever to just get around. Sometimes, when he was off alone by himself doin' his chores, Kidd couldn't help but think about his best friend Pokey. He missed the bear cub a whole lot, and every night when Kidd knelt beside his bed and prayed for his dad and mom, he always remembered little Pokey in his prayers. Deep in the boy's heart, he wanted more than anything to see his friend again. Oh, he knew from the start that they'd have to go their separate ways someday, but it just seemed to Kidd that it all happened way too fast. Kidd remembered when he and Pokey used to go exploring together, and how nosey little Pokey would always take off, climbin' a tree or gettin' into some kind of trouble. (wistful music) (bear growls) (bear growls Then one day, Kidd was headed for the stream to try his luck at fishin', with no way of knowin' that a big, hungry grizzly was already there ahead of him. (bear growls) (bear growls) (foreboding music) (bear growling) (bear growls) (bear growls) (bear growls) One thing Kidd had learned from Pokey was how to climb trees, fast. Came in mighty handy about now, too. Kidd had never seen such a big bear. Matter of fact, the grizzly was so huge she couldn't even hope to climb up the tree after the boy. But Kidd was still scared as the dickens. Some grizzly bears have been known to wait beneath a tree for several days and nights, just waitin' for a man to fall asleep and drop to the ground. (bear growls) Then, suddenly just down the hill a ways, little Pokey heard a familiar voice cry out. Pokey knew he had to do somethin' to get his mama away from his friend. (apprehensive music) So like a child who doesn't want to go to school, Pokey put on the old tummy ache act. (Pokey bellows) His mother thought Pokey was bein' attacked by six wolves at the same time. And that gave Kidd just enough time to hightail it back to the safety of the cabin. Pokey's mother decided she'd better keep a closer eye on her cub before he got lost again, for it was nearly time for both of them to go into hibernation for the winter. Back at the cabin, Ezra's condition had taken a turn for the worse. Eve was desperate now. But she tried very hard not to let Kidd see it in her, as they packed the last of their supplies into the boy's backpack. They only had one chance now. Kidd would hike on foot for the fur trading post for a rescue party. The weather was clear, but gettin' colder, which meant the heavy winter snows would probably start fallin' any time now. - Everything's in your pack. Now stay on the trail, and don't stop for anything. - I'll be back for nightfall. - Okay. Here, take your hat. - [Narrator] Eve didn't like sendin' Kidd off alone like this, but it was their only chance. Without help, the whole family would perish in the frozen wilderness. (wind blowing) (plaintive music) Eve hadn't told her son that she'd given him the last few scraps of food. She'd never shot a gun in her life, but Ezra was weak and near to death from undernourishment. Eve had to find some food. (foreboding music) The old pack horse was weak from hunger and sufferin' from the cold. Soon, he'd die anyway. But still, it was the toughest thing Eve ever had to do. (gun fires) (thundering) (wind blowing) Without a warnin' the wind started comin' up, blowin' dark storm clouds in through the mountain pass. (apprehensive music) Kidd had never felt such a cold wind before, but kept on goin', best as he could. And the trail was impossible to follow now. Kidd began to lose his sense of direction in the storm. His tracks were already covered by the blowin' snow. Kidd was lost in a frozen, Alaskan blizzard. (bubbling) All of a sudden, Kidd woke up from what seemed to be a long, quiet sleep. At first, he didn't even know where he was. And then he slowly began to recognize the sound of bubblin' water. It was the hot spring. He was layin' in a warm pool of water at the hot spring, the same spring where Kidd and his mom and Pokey used to go swimmin'. But how did he get here? An Indian boy, the son of a fur trapper workin' out of the Hudson Bay Tradin' Post had been out collectin' traps with his dad when he spotted a kid layin' in the snow, unconscious, and nearly frozen. The older boy brought Kidd to the hot spring to thaw him out and feed him some Indian corn meal, while his dad went back to the Tradin' Post for help. (gentle music) A short time later, the rescue party arrived, takin' Eve and Ezra and Kidd out of the wilderness. Before she left, Eve had taken the gold, all of it, wrapped it in an old burlap sack, and buried it in the snow far out behind the cabin. The gold had nearly cost them their lives, and Eve wanted nothin' to do with it ever again. As I once said, Alaska's a big place. To most men, these mountains and canyons all look alike. They're rugged, and the man has to be rugged too, in order to even leave this wilderness alive. Someday, when the Alaska wildflowers pop up and the spring comes to the wilderness, when the bighorn sheep, moose and all other animals start to roam the green valleys again, some lonely prospector will stumble across an old log cabin somewhere far up in the mountains, and there, he may just uncover the fabulously rich treasure, solid gold nuggets, dozens of 'em, enough wealth to last a man for many lifetimes. Lucky Ezra's gold. But one warnin', if you ever decide to come lookin' for Ezra's treasure, take my advice, beware of the grizzly (bear growls) who guards the gold. (dynamic music)
