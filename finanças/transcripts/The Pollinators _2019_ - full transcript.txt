The hives are sitting on pallets -- They're either four hives on a pallet, or there are six hives on a pallet. And everybody's got forklifts. You know, all-terrain forklifts, Bobcats, swingers, articulated loaders. Most of all of our short-distance bee moving for pollinating apples and vegetables and so on, that's all done with straight trucks and so forth. [ Indistinct conversations ] Now we start crisscrossing the United States, that's all done with semis. Most of the public out here has probably seen loads of bees going down a road and didn't even know what they were looking at. Just looks like something covered up with a big net. Most of the bee moving all is done at nighttime. The bees all come home in the evening, you know, come in after dusk. So, we wait till the bees are all home, and then we go out there and load them and send them on their merry way. So, when a semi-truck gets to its destination, there'll be a beekeeper there that's gonna unload that truck and put them out in the almond orchard, the apples, the blueberries, or what have you. The farmer, basically, pays us for bringing the bees in -- depends what the crop is. You know, almonds in California, the going rate right now is anywhere from $165 to $225 a hive. And that's for a period of, you know, five to six weeks while the almond bloom is. ♪♪ [ Whirring ] ♪♪ -Many crops require pollination by insects, and because the native pollinators who used to be here are no longer in large enough quantities to do that pollination, the managed honey bees have stepped in to take the role of pollinator. -Pollination is a basic natural function. A lot of plants in nature need insects to transfer pollen, and one of the most efficient is the honey bee. -So, basically, you know, of all the good stuff we eat, you know, the vegetables and the fruits and so on, most of that needs honey bee pollination or pollination by native pollinators. -The chemical companies -- they figure we should eat corn, soybeans, and rice, and that don't need to be pollinated. And that's what they think we ought to live on. But if you like your fruits and vegetables and your nuts, a lot of that stuff need pollinating. A lot of wild insects can do the job, but not as well as bringing in a commercial beekeeper to put down a thousand colonies in one area and give a good blast to the pollination. -Our business has got two different ends to it. One of them is producing honey, but, of course, the reason them honey bees are here in the first place is to pollinate our crops, you know, 'cause one out of every three bites of food we put in our mouths comes from honey bee pollination. -I think the general public should know that our food system is threatened by the fact that the bees are in trouble. And they should care about that because they eat food. -So, the problem is that native pollinators have disappeared and farming has become a lot bigger, and so due to all this, you know, now they need beekeepers that can move bees from one place to the other. And, of course, the only bees that are really movable, that you could put on the back of a truck and truck them all over the place is honey bees. The big pollination in this country is almonds, which is in the dead of the winter. The almond tree's not very smartin that way, because blooming in the end of February, in through March. So, in California, now today, there's close to a million acres of almonds. It takes two hives of bees to the acre to pollinate them almonds. So these bees got to crisscross the United States to get there. Our business, basically -- it's a timing situation, that orchard or blueberry grower or almond grower, or vegetable grower, his livelihood is depending on him growing a crop. And if that crop isn't pollinated when the flowers are in bloom, we got a short window there. When he picks up the phone and calls us -- "In two days, I need bees" -- it's not two weeks, or two months. He needs bees in two days. ♪♪ -Beekeepers are kind of like the last of the cowboys you've seen in the Westerns. We migrate the bees from up in the northern prairies all down here to the Bakersfield area, and we keep 'em in the west side of the valley. When the spring bloom comes, we'll take the bees, and we'll spread 'em from the Turlock area down to the southern Bakersfield area. The almond pollination is the biggest pollination event in the U.S. bee industry. It takes almost the entire national bee supply. ♪♪ -And so a semi-truck will hold somewhere around 400 to 450 hives of bees. And so you start thinking about this. It takes somewhere in the neighborhood of two million hives of bees in California. Say, you know, a couple hundred thousand of them are already there, maybe 250,000 of them are already there, so that means the rest of those beehives have to come from someplace else. So there's a lot of truckloads of bees crisscrossing the United States. -Our honey bees get picked up and moved almost 22 times a year. And a lot of people think that this is one of the reasons why our bees are not surviving like they used to. But we've been pollinating fruits and vegetables and nuts since the '70s, '60s, '50s, and we haven't had these kind of losses. -You know, it depends on whose numbers you look at, but the USDA numbers say we have somewhere around 2.6 million hives. And the Bee Informed Partnershipout of Maryland's been showing -- been losing 30% to 40% of our hives. So a 30% loss there puts us downto about 1.8 million hives, and that's about what the almond industry takes, so we're almost at 100% utilization of the bee supply. [ Bees buzzing ] -We rely on the managed honey bee for our relatively inexpensive fruits and vegetables that we have in the grocery story, and this means that they're in an area that is treated with pesticides on a regular basis and also densely packed with agricultural crops, leaving very few wildflowers. Once the crop has bloomed, there's nothing there for the bees to eat. For example, the almond bloom in California -- very intense activity for the bees for about a month, and then the beekeepers can't leave their bees there afterwards because there's nothing more for the bees to eat. The managed honey bee has the beekeeper helping them survive because it's in everyone's interest for the bees to survive, and so they do move their bees to places that have good forage, away from threats, although that's not always possible. The native pollinators are in deep trouble. They're in trouble because they can't move away from agriculture. We're not monitoring the populations as well as the managed honey bees but we are seeing in certain places that their populations have plummeted. One, the rusty patched bumble bee, was just listed as an endangered species and a lot has to do with agriculture and pesticide use, in particular. -It's so important what happens in California 'cause it sets up the table for the rest of the year, because right after the almonds -- Almonds are the earliest crop in the spring, and after this, most of the bees will go either into a secondary pollination or into a breeding program to replace the old queens and to make up for the previous year's death losses. It's really important on how bees come out here and the Almond Board of California has done some really good extension work, trying to educateall the farmers across the state on what the best management practices are for bee conservation. But it's kind of sad sometimes, you know. A farmer or a rancher has so many obligations, he doesn't have time to stay up with the latest technology until there's a bad event. ♪♪ -Bees are important for all kinds of reasons. They're important because we're not capable of making all kinds of things grow by ourselves. It's not some kind of magic, it's a deep biological process, of which, bees are a part. But bees are also important to us because they're a very good kind of sentinel signal for the trouble that we're in. There they are every day, out in the world, foraging through every corner of the rural landscape. If suddenly, one year, 25% of them show up missing, that means there is something wrong with that landscape. -There's been a pretty dramatic change in agriculture over the last 20 years or so in the types of pesticides that are being used. In 1996, Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act that required a reevaluation of all of the existing pesticides, and the ones that were really a big target because they were so problematicfor worker poisonings were these nerve toxins called organophosphates and carbamate pesticides. Those have dropped dramatically in use. Many of them have been pulled out of the system altogether. And what came into replace them are a group of pesticides called the neonicotinoids, and starting in 1994, the first one was registered in the U.S., and every year, more and more crops and more and more acres are treated with these types of pesticides. These are very problematic for bees, and while the organophosphates were highly toxic to bees, they degraded relatively quickly. The neonicotinoids take years to degrade in the environment, and what that means is, you're going to continue to poison the bees for many years after you apply these pesticides. They're so widely marketed and so widely used that they're, really, everywhere now. -Neonicotinoids basically work by breaking down immune system, cause the insects to lose their memory, make them sick. Whether it's the insect or it's a human, you know, your immune system's broke down,you don't want to eat, and that's exactly what we got going on inside these honey bee hives, and, eventually, you know, we're going to somebody's funeral. -Bees, it turns out, are very good at picking up pesticides in the environment. It seems like even the smallest amount of pesticide, even if pesticides have been sprayed months or even a year or two earlier, there seems to be residues in the environment, and the bees seem to pick these things up and actually bring them back to the hive. It was shocking how much pesticide and the diversity of pesticides that we were finding -- herbicides, fungicides, growth regulators, insecticides, all of them showed up in samples that we collected and looked at across the country. It was -- It was disturbing. Most pesticides are lipophilic, meaning they want to dissolve in a fat, and so pollen and particularly wax are fats. Wax, it turns out, is almost like a fossil record. The wax combs that the bees live in, that they put their food in, that the brood is produced in, accumulates and holds onto these pesticide contaminants, and so it's very hard for a beekeeper who's doing crop pollination to protect their bees from pesticides -- very hard. -The effect of pesticides on bees of all sorts, our native species, as well as honey bees, has been documented in North America, and now it's being documented worldwide. And this is a real -- a real concern, that pesticides seem to be playing a key role in the downturn of our bee populations. -The fighting man came home. Families that have been torn apart were reunited. -Something changed after World War II in America for agriculture. The advent of synthetic chemicals that could be used to poison insects was a big one. -Man fights back. Modern insecticides have come into being as a hoped for poison gas to stop the enemy. The stakes are high -- millions of dollars of valuable foods stand as the reward. -And synthetic chemists, taking chemicals from the paints and pigments industry and other industrial uses, and evaluating those for their potential use in agriculture really accelerated the development of synthetic pesticide production. Natural molecules like nicotine and pyrethrum that have an inherent property for killing insects, could those be improved upon? And the answer was yes, and without any other regard about what placing that chemicalin the environment might mean, short-term or long-term, at first it seemed like this was the silver bullet. There are major differences between the United States and Europe and other places, in a philosophical basis, by which risks for pesticides are evaluated, and in the European Union, the precautionary principle, which states that, if we don't understand fully the risk of using something, we should not use it until we have that greater understanding. Whereas in the United States, without the precautionary principle, we say, "Well, let's take the risk, and we'll find out if it's not working and readjust." And that's a matter of law that the EPA's bound by, but I would really like to see us reevaluate that situation from a policymaking standpoint. -I mean, nobody's looking at what damage we're doing here to our environment. Some of the stuff we're using is a neurotoxin that's gonna destroy our health and children and everything else, but we're spraying it 'cause somebody has more say and more power than we do. ♪♪ ♪♪ -Yesterday, I got a call from one of the partners of this ranch, said, you know, "Adee, the bees are dying.

They were dying today as they were looking at them. The first sets they were looking at, we seen bees laying on the ground. We found a queen staggering out in front of a hive. Anyway, that's what we want to do, is find out what's affecting it. This family spent a lot of moneyfor these bees, and they're counting on them for their pollination. And it would be terrible to think that they were doing something that was completely legal and by the book, yet it was hurting the bees, and if a neighbor was being sloppy and hurting the bees, that would be really bad, too, but something's definitely hurting the bees. -How many are you here? -We just finished eight. -Okay, that's fine. -Yeah, yeah.

It was a parasite in Southeast Asia, and around the 1960s, it started making the spread around the world. Now it's present pretty much everywhere honey bees are kept. -It's a small, little mite that if you compared it to the size of a human being, a 150-pound human being, it would be like having a tick the size of your fist. So, it's a huge parasite relative to the bee's body. And it, literally, just pokes right through the body wall of the bee and feeds on it, both the adult bee and the developing bee, in the larval and pupal stage. -Mites carry viruses. They transmit viruses, and they also, we know, suppress the immune system. So, it's like a double whammy for the bees. -You can kind of imagine it as a triangle. There are parasites at the top of this triangle, pesticides, and poor nutrition. There's a lot going on. But it seems like they're all related to each other. -Most bee populations can deal with one of these issues, but they can't deal with multiple ones at the same time. Example of this is the interaction of Varroa mites and pesticides and viruses. -The mites are parasites that weaken the bees. They weaken the bees and make them more susceptible to pesticides. The pesticides further weaken the bees. They reduce the population, the number of bees that are in the colony, and that gives you a lower force of bees to actually go out and retrieve food. -So, you have this sort of feedback loop where, you know, if you have high pesticides, virus titers can go higher, Varroa populations can go higher, which can transmit more virus, and then you can get into the cycle that your bees are unable to cope with. -The big problem with the mite is... how do you get rid of a bug on a bug? We think we've put a chemical in there to treat the mite, and we're going to kill the mites.

Go right out the road here, until you turn left, and then make that first right. ♪♪ [ Rooster crows ] -We can learn a good deal from bees about the health of the landscapes that we inhabit. And sort of secondarily, we can learn a good deal about the folly of setting up our agriculture in quite the way that we have. It looked so efficient and concentrate everything in the ways that we've done it, but that turns out to be a false efficiency. It is the cheapest way to produce pork or corn or whatever else, but that cheapness comes at a high price, and that price is the loss of the agricultural diversity, redundancy, resiliency, that is really beyond price. You know it's the thing that we've built up over 10,000 years of agriculture, and now in a kind of hundred years of industrialization, we've managed to get rid of most of it. -The Industrial Revolution in the early 1900s was founded to take people off the land, bring them into cities and into places where there were other kinds of jobs that could be more profitable for them. We had more than enough people to grow the food that was necessary. And so the emphasis in agriculture was totally focused on increasing the productivity of crop production and animal production of the individual farm level. And we've made great strides in doing that. And as a consequence, fewer and fewer individuals are engaged in farming because fewer individuals can farm larger and larger operations, whether that's a milking herd of a 100 cows, or farming 300 or 400 acres of crops. We've evolved a system that's efficient from use of land in terms of amount of food that can be produced on it, but it's not a sustainable system. It's not healthy for the soil. It's not healthy for the productthat's produced in terms of its nutrition or other properties, and it's not healthy for the environment as a whole. -Well, we went down a road with agriculture, didn't we? And that road said that the only way to be a successful farmer was to have clean fields and control -- in control of your land, right? If you had weeds or if you had something out of place, you were a bad farmer, and the easiest way to maintain that -- As that perception started to increase, the food production system became simpler and simpler and simpler. And the only way to maintain a simplified system is with more and more jugs, you know? Maybe it's fertilizers, maybe it's GM plants, maybe it's herbicides, maybe it's insecticides, fungicides. Simplify it. Control it, right? And that seems to have worked for a long time, but the cracks are really showing through in the ice right now. Everything within the current infrastructure is hell-bent on making the system work, rather than questioning, should we have ever gone down this road to begin with? -In the year 2000, the only corn you saw in eastern North Dakota was silage corn, and there were a few soybean fields, but not very many. And in 2006, George Bush gave a talk, and he mentioned something called biofuels. [ Chuckles ] And as soon as that happened, the renewable fuel standard was created. We saw massive changes here in North Dakota. Now the two predominant crops are corn and soybeans and we have lost many, many opportunities for producing honey due to those changes. A lot of the grassland,a lot of the conservation acres, a lot of the more traditional crops have all been replacedwith acres of corn and soybeans. -When we were looking at mappingaround apiaries in North Dakota, we were looking at the amount of grasslands and natural areas and stuff. And as those grasslands and all disappeared and turned into crops, like corn and soybeans, there's very little fencerows or hedgerows at all. So you've got corn and soybeans that bloom, you know, one time during the year. Very little other forage out there. And plus, you've got the pesticide exposure that comes with agriculture. ♪♪ -A lot of them grasslands have not had anything planted on it for hundreds of years and, all of a sudden, we have corn in areas that shouldn't have corn because of ethanol. And if they stop planting corn today, it's going to take 20 to 30 years for that ground to get back in the shape it was to sustain life for all these wild insects, birds, and fowl, and everything else. So we're not doing ourselves any good. -Agriculture, you know, is an interruption of a natural system. But it can be done thoughtfully as an interruption of a natural system with great benefits. From what I've studied and what I've learned from visits to these farms that are forced into monoculture -- I just want to be careful that we talk about farmers that are driven to want to farm in monocultures. There aren't a lot that I've met. We have a system that's teetering. It's hard to recognize that because the supermarket shelves are filled. The instability is there because of our food choices. Not because of some evil empire trying to destabilize our breadbasket to the world. If anything, it's because we have demanded an alarmingly small diversity of grains mostly that feed us, and that's pushed the food system that we have into the place it's in. So, it's a reflection of us. -Crop rotation is just really moving plants around to different areas. Rotation in general is a really important concept in nature. It reduces the potential of accumulated pathogens. It exercises the soil to really draw different things out of it, because every plant species has a different need that it's taking from the soil. Kind of moving through sort of a procession of plants. You're balancing the soil and working with that system. That's not the case with corn and soy. It's our choice to have transposed this grass crop, as corn or soybean crop, on top of what really wants to be a perennial grassland. If we could really look close at the Plains, we would see huge shifts in species. And not just the animalsmoving across in the way they do but the grasses changing, one species to another, over long periods of time. What made the Great Plains is that movement and change. We have some of the most beautiful soil on this planet in the Midwest of our country and we're just chipping it away with corn and soy. We're not generating something new. There's more that could be addedwith the corn and soy. -We've lived in the Garden of Eden. We came to a place that had virgin soils and has temperate climate that have resulted in an over-abundance of food from the beginning. And when the soils were depletedon the East Coast, we plowed up the Midwest and became very rich off of that. And when those soils were depleted and distraught, we moved west. Manifest Destiny is about chasing virgin soil and yields, and we have come to the end of the line, of course, only just recently. And so the question now is a real inflection point of a fork in the road -- Do you put the pedal to the metal and try and increase the yields? You think about how we produce food in a completely different way, and if we do, then we have to change the whole food culture. We really have to create a system, a pattern of eating that supports the kind of diversity that the landscape needs to be healthy. We don't have that. -Think about a place like the Dakotas, which used to be a diverse agricultural landscape and actually perfect for bees, in that part of their cycle, you know, far north. We've turned it into a agricultural monoculture. And we've interspersed that monoculture with thousands of oil wells, as we have fracked apart the Bakken shale. It's a pretty remarkable industrial landscape now. And it's not very friendly to people, at least the people who'd been there for many thousands of years, who have tried their best to stand up against things like the Dakota Access Pipeline. And it's not very friendly to wild nature, including the pollinators. We have this idea of the American west as this great untamed natural place, but, in fact, outside of the national parks, it's been about as industrialized as it's possible to get. ♪♪ -The bees are dying right now.

Pollution in the environment, a simplified agricultural system, a simplified landscape where they can't find food. Suddenly, you've got starving,poisoned bees, and guess what -- They get sick. So, what do I see when I see this simplified system?

That's up along the hill up here. It's about two years old. We're also growing some yellow field peas. So, we got a diverse mix of some things, but we're just not your standard farmers. Last probably six, seven years, we've been farming a little bit different than mainstream agriculture. We've been trying to solve some problems we're seeing on some of our farms and bring it full circle and bring it into modern agriculture and not just be satisfied with status quo, I guess. A lot of things are self-pollinating. That's why, I think, a lot of farmers don't recognize bees as an important issue. Because, well, what do I need to worry about bees for? The rye pollinates itself. The corn pollinates itself. Farmers need to realize, is that the bees are, like, one of the first line of defense of why they're disappearing. If the bees are disappearing, what else has disappeared already, because we don't count anything else. And I think that's -- that's kind of the canary in the mine shaft. Opened our eyes up to pay attention to what's going on the fields. And people don't think about how pollination is important but it's -- Without pollination, we wouldn'thave nothing but a stalk here. So... Traditional farming guys have a breakeven on -- They need the yields so much, because I need to get a hundred bushel of corn to sell for "X" amount of dollars to pay for my input costs, to breakeven. Anything above that's good -- that's the money you make. But everybody gets focused on the yield, yield, yield. We need more yield to make money. And it's -- In my book, it's not all about yield. It's about being profitable on the front side with keeping your costs at bay. Most farmers would be freaking out by this crop that's standing here, and I'm just tickled to death that it's still here yet. This rye is going to lay down and create a mat on top of the surface. It's going to create a habitat for insects. But it takes some management. And the problem is, is this isn't simple. This isn't -- This is outside the box, and farmers want to be in the box. They want to buy it in the jug. They want to buy it in the bag. I don't want to buy it in the bag or a jug because that all costs me money. Yes, cover crop seed costs me money, but it's about learning how to work with nature and allowing our plants to work for us. -This was a soybean field last year. And soon as the soybeans come off, we get right on it with a drill and plant the cover crop. And it's the multispecies, They call it multispecies. It's crimson clover, the vetch, the sweet peas, the rye. He's got as much as seven and eight different varieties. He's just he's always trying something.

The farmer that I rent this from, he grows pumpkins and sweet corn, and the last three, four years, his goal and my goal is create habitat for beneficial insects and the bees. Part of the field, it doesn't get sprayed, just to start working with nature a little bit and help them out a little bit. He takes pumpkins to local produce over here, and they want to know how much time he spends washing his pumpkins, and he said, "I don't wash my pumpkins hardly anymore because they're all clean. They lay on top of this rye." And they said, "Well, you're full of mud. You can't no-till pumpkins," and he's like, "Well, come to my farm." -What we've got here is -- this is going to be a pumpkin field. So, about a month ago, we came in, and we planted an early pollinator strip, which was buckwheat and mustard, and the idea is to try to get that established quickly so that when you know, we do start to plant pumpkins in here, that there already will be something existing to attract our beneficial insects. The idea to that is then that we will have something blooming the entire time that the pumpkins are growing. So, another tactic, if you want to put it that way, we tried this year was... Now, we did this about 10 days ago, where we came in, and we planted a row of Blue Hubbard squash. I've been told by numerous seed companies and also other producers that Blue Hubbard squash attractthe cucumber beetles particularly more than they will attract to regular pumpkin plants. The idea is, it creates a trap for these bugs to come to. So, I pulled back the rye here that was the cover crop in this field, and this is one of the Blue Hubbard plants right here. You can see how it's chewed. Now, the cucumber beetles you're not seeing right now because they're very shy. As soon as they hear or see something, they take off and hide in the residue, which you can see here, as well,which feeds our biologics and our critters that live in our soils here. But there you can see what we got, and they're just chewing the bejeepers out of this row, and if we go over here... ...here's a row that's 6 feet away from it, and this isn't just one that I picked out. They're in a row here, every 4 feet. You can see that this plant is green and lush and no insect damage on it, whatsoever. There's another one and right on down the row. This is not the results I expected to see this early. I really didn't expect to see this till later when there was actual flowers on them and there'd be more pollen there and that pollen I believe is more attracted -- the cucumber beetles are more attracted to that type pollen. So, it has just really been amazing, and, like I said, we're in the very beginning stages of this, but man, it's got me fired up right now. So, we're excited. What we're going to do is, we're going to use our little hand sprayer and we're only going to spray this row. If we can keep them contained to one area and not have to spray insecticide over the entire field, which, you know, most of the insecticides, when you spray it, you kill everything, and we don't want to do that. [ Sheep bleat ] -Regenerative farming, number one, it's the future of our food production system. I don't see any other way around it. The principles seem to be consistent. Do not disturb the soil. Tillage was one of our biggest follies. Number two, there should always be a living root in that soil. Number three is, some diversity of plants is better than none, and more is better than less. And then the final principle that seems to be unifying in all of these different regenerative farms is integrating crops and livestock production. We separated them, didn't we? We partitioned those things, so now we ship our grain from our cornfield over to a feed lot and shove it down a cow's throat, and then we have to pump the manure back over onto the crop ground, and that's like, what on Earth happened here? When, really, all the cows want to do is just eat grass to begin with. -It's also an opportunity where everybody wins. The farmers win. The beekeepers win. Rural communities are regenerated.

They know how bad this chemical issue is coming off the corn, but when you talk to them, the first thing out of the guy's mouth is, "What do you want me to do, tell the farmer he can't use his new $150,000 piece of equipment?" And that my thing was, what does it matter to you? You're the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. Your job is protecting the environment at all cost.

The Office of Research and Development does, but they don't regulate anything. The Office of Pesticide Programshas people who review studies that are done by, typically, chemical manufacturers, themselves, or consulting companies that they hire to do these studies. Guidelines for studies on honey bees are not very well developed yet, and just in the last few years do they even have some guidelines. And I would say there's only been probably three or four real studies done that look at the bees in their environment, instead of in the lab. -I think there's infighting sometimes in the EPA.

Instead of registering a product and making sure this product's okay, we come up with a new thingcalled conditional registration. Here's the packet. We did the research. We want a conditional registration. The rules read that, after this product's out there, EPA has to review it, and it can only be there so longwith conditional registration.

[ Chuckling ] And I don't know if there is or not, but it does look like a lot of times, you have what's called, I guess in political science, "the captured client," where the regulated ends up controlling the regulator. And it's the idea that a registrant that wants -- or a manufacturer, that's a nice name for a manufacturer of a product -- wants to bring a product to the market, so he'll write up the test and show the EPA the test he wants to do to test the product for its environmental impact. Then they'll give him the nod, "Yeah, this is a good test." Then he'll go test it, and he'll generate all the results himself, and then he'll give the results back to the EPA for evaluation. So, you know, given that model, I think there's not a single person that couldn't be a Harvard scholar. It's like, I get to write my own test, I get to take my own test, and I get to turn the results in.

First step in the harvest is taking the honey away from the bees. And then we'll heat it up, and our first machine will take these little wax caps off. Just a very thin layer of wax. The bees put this cap on when they get it dry enough so it won't spoil. When it gets down below 18.5% moisture, it becomes so dry that it can't ferment. And so they put the cap on to keep it from re-absorbing moisture. And then we'll put it in a centrifuge.

Everybody wants a magnificent green lawn without a single dandelion or clover plant in that lawn or a blooming flower in that lawn. That's a food desert for bees. If you want a green lawn, great. You know, let your front yard be green and allow the backyard to have some dandelions and clover and grow a pollinator garden. Herbicides, fungicides and insecticides -- all three of those categories are problematic for our bees. And, again, it's not just honey bees. It's all of our bee species. -So, consumers may be curious as to how they can figure out whether a pesticide product may hurt bees or not, and I would avoid anything systemic. You could also avoid pesticides altogether. [ Laughs ] That's probably the best way. There may be situations where you find it really important, that you have a particular tree that you want to save, in which case, using pesticides that are approved for use in organic systems are generally much less toxic, and they won't be as persistent,for sure, as the conventional pesticides. -The dream of having agriculturewithout pesticides is not a completely unrealistic dream. But it means that science would have to understand the complexity of biology far more than we do now. What the field of chemical ecology tells us or gives us hope is that if we understand the true complexities of the system, we may be able to use those complexities in a way that benefits us and is more sustainable than if we try to come in and overpower the system with an external chemical that doesn't belong there. -Beekeeping has changed a lot in the last 10 years. In urban areas, in cities, people keeping bees on rooftops, keeping them on their balconies. -It seems backwards to say honey bees do well in urban areas, but there's not as much natural forage as there used to be, so in cities, there's all these buffer zones, and people like to plant colorful gardens, so there is more natural forage. -Research is helping us to better understand what habitat we need to create, and we're working right here with the USGS in order to better understand which of these flowers the bees are using, when they're using them and what it's going to do for the hives, and that is going to be used to generate better recipes for pollinator habitat and conservation initiatives and policy. -I think the bees provide, you know, sort of this window into the natural world that people are very excited about, and they want to support this as best as they can. And then that trickles down into, you know, this renewed interest and understanding where our food comes from. -When I started this job, you know, it was basically older men who were keeping bees, even at the, you know, backyard level. And they were desperate for more young people to get into beekeeping. They weren't so vocal about women, about wanting to have women [chuckling] come in to the beekeeping arena, but there are now. And there are a lot of young people, a lot of new people, and it's very interesting. The older beekeepers are a bit flummoxed, because they don't know how to deal with all these young people with new ideas and, you know, new approaches and the Internet and where they're getting their information. So it's been a very interesting to see how things have changed. -The success of what's happening with honey bees is education. It's going out in your community and talking to people about bees, about farming, bringing a beehive to your child's school. You're seeing more female beekeepers. You're seeing younger beekeepers. You're seeing kids taking the beekeeping course 'cause they read about the bees or they're learned, and they want to help. They want to be a beekeeper. -The U.S. beekeeping industry and the U.S. production agriculture, I think, would not have survived the last 10 years if it hadn't been for the hard work of beekeepers. Just dedicated to beekeeping and replacing dead colonies and stuff. And so that's all come at a cost to them, usually personally, you know, in lost time and money and things like that, And a lot of people don't recognize that. So, I think the U.S. beekeepers have to be applauded for staying in there when the losses were so high, otherwise they could have cut and run and just gotten out of the business, but they didn't. They stayed in there, and most of them have found ways to be a bit more productive. Not as productive as they were in the past. But we're still facing some uphill battles in just trying to manage good bees and keep them healthy. -European Union-wide, there is a moratorium on use of neonicotinoid insecticides on bee-attractive crops. So any legislation like that that comes up, the average person can make a difference by letting their legislator know that they want them to help protect bees, and that that is a really important concept and is going to help them get reelected, perhaps, if they do support bees. -So, what can consumers do? Consumers can be aware of where their food comes from. Food is so available in this country and so cheap. We really have very little appreciation for what it takes to produce food. -Our foundation, our history is built on agriculture and family farms. It's getting wiped out through big agriculture and, you know, big chemical companies. How do we bring a respect and a reverence back for the foundation of what the country was built on and how do we do that in a way that's sustainable, that looks towards the future and future generations. Putting beehives in cities where people can go up and see agriculture for the first time -- you know, a lot of them for the first time in their lives. And to learn so much so quickly,it's the root of what Bee Downtown is doing in cities, is trying to just share education about it. There are so many fantastic beekeepers across the country, and if we can help tell their stories in cities, then it helps to bring back a respect and an understanding for how much work goes into agriculture. -A really simple thing people can do is just buy U.S. honey. It's cheaper to buy some of the foreign honeys, but to keep the bee industry alive and healthy, one of the things we need to do is just buy U.S. honey. If you know the beekeeper, go directly to him. If you're in a larger urban areaand you don't have that luxury, you know, source it and check the jar to make sure it says it's a product of USA. If honey is a viable alternative, we can keep the bees on flowers more. -You know, supporting local foods and local farmers is, again, a great way to better connect with your community, better sort of see what's going on, you know, in your backyard, as it were, and understand where your food is coming from. -Also, as consumers, accept more blemishes on our apples. We can say it's okay. Right now, we want the perfect apple. We want the perfect piece of fruit. And what it takes to produce that perfect piece of fruit is a lot of pesticide, a lot of chemical pesticide. The perfect apple is not the perfect apple. -A better way for creating a sustainable agricultural system is starting to come not from the regulatory agencies, not from the top down, but from the bottom up. From the consumers demanding organic food, from places like Costco and Walmart providing organic food because they're big enough that they need contracts with growers. They say "We need 500 acres of organic tomato sauce. Can you do it?" And then it's like you're not swimming upstream anymore. It's capitalism, and you're using that economic driver to change the farming system. That's where the future is, in my opinion. -We're seeing more people buying directly from farmers in different ways, through farm markets, through CSAs. There's a whole food movement that is very exciting, and a lot of young people actually are very aware that there is a problem, and they want to know where their food comes from. They want to eat good, healthy food. So, I am hopeful. I am hopeful. You know, it's like so many things -- Things have to get really low. Things have to get really bad before they get better, and I hope we're as low as we're going to go. -I mean, I see the future, and it gets me so excited, you know? Not just the future in terms of bees, but also it's so exciting to see these farmers totally change what we think we know. Challenge the system, you know. -Paying attention to the natural world around us and how it operates can be a lesson for us in how to not only survive among fellow human beings, but survive in synchrony with our environment. -Bees are just one of those things that benefit all the way around. You know, you can see it if you watch it. And then you can see it quantified when scientists watch it. I mean, we know bees are the right thing to have on the landscape. We know it's a win-win-win, and we really get a nice pleasure out of it when other people realize it, too. -I don't care how many of these little, you know, whack-a-moles that you knock down. Your arm is going to get tired before you solve the bee problem. You need to focus back on reinventing how we produce our food to begin with. Then suddenly neonics aren't an issue anymore. You just don't need it. You don't need all the glyphosate anymore. And... yeah. And we have healthy kids again. We have healthy bees. ♪♪ ♪♪
