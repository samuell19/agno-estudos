That's Kim, she once had a family. Mika's on the right; she once had a family. And they're both my family. Paul? I'm going to tell you a story about a lonely mouse who risks everything in order to become what he fears most: the great eagle. In order to see like the eagle, he has to go to places that are unknown and dangerous for mice. He stood at the edge of the desert, and there he saw the sacred mountains for the first time. This is where he had to go. But he would have to watch for the shadows of the great bird of prey. He gathered his courage and jumped out into the desert. In the cruel heat, he saw other mice who chased their own tails they were being eaten, one by one. For they had become blind, staring up into the sky. Our brother mouse gave up one of his own eyes so they could see. The other mice loved him and begged him to stay. He was torn. But the vision of the sacred mountains burned within his heart. And he went on. Time for bed now, Paul! Hurry up, your sister's already in bed. Paul, get in here! # I # # I will be king # # And you # # You will be queen # # Though nothing # # Will drive them away # Hey retard, get in here! Nothing is ready yet. We're never gonna get out of here. # We can be heroes # - Hurry up and get here Paul! Turn that fuckin' thing off! # Just for one day # Hurry up! Turn it off! # And you # - There, that's better! You know we're leaving for Truth or Consequences tomorrow. What is it with that drilling? Paul? Paul, do you hear me when I'm talking to you? Well you'd better start listening to me, because once we get those papers signed in New Mexico, I'm gonna be your legal mother. Request to adopt minor Paul, no last name. Approximate date of birth, 1960. Hospital record lost. Origin: Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. Proposed custodian: Kim Flores. Sex: female. Age: 27 years. Occupation: intends to drive a cab. Comments: Kim is responsible for Paul's general welfare. She and Paul share a one-bedroom apartment with Mika Yamata. Mika Yamata: sex, female; age, 19 years. Occupation: crane operator. Comments: Mika is considered Paul's sister, and she has responsibility for his welfare. Report: Paul is a learning-disabled youngster with certain specific physical constraints due to cerebral palsy. Recent tests show him to be functioning several years behind grade level, which may be due to unstable living situation. Paul's strengths are in the area of visual conception. He has trouble distinguishing fantasy from reality. Example: He believes that a Native American has taught him everything he knows and is responsible for his moral decision-making. Recommendations: That Paul be taken from the environment he lives in and be placed in a behavior management program, where it be prescribed that he be monitored at all times for reality-based decisions and penalized for distortion. Needless to say, such programming would be ineffective without a normal family environment. So Paul has taken these photographs? Yes, he collects them. Miss Yamata, you're an American citizen? Yes, she is. And she has a job at the construction site. Miss Yamata, do you speak English? Well sure she does; she's just a little bit shy. I was directing my questions to Miss Yamata. Now let me get this straight. You and Miss Yamata intend to adopt Paul, when all the testing shows that your living situation is a retardant to his development? Retarded, she's not retarded. Look, I told you, she's just a little bit shy. The report spells it all out, very clearly. You and Miss Yamata are not our idea of a normal family. Why else would Paul invent an Indian, except as a substitute father? Photographs don't make our reports. I don't even have Paul's birth certificate from Truth or Consequences. This will have to be a temporary living arrangement until all the papers are in order and a foster family can be found. I'm sorry, I can't help you. # Oh dear # Mika? Hawk told me a story. Hawk? He told me a story. You know the story he told at the construction site. But I don't understand. Paul, does, does Dolly Parton give you a hard-on when she's on TV? # Me said me love # Huh? I'm confused, I don't understand it. Does Dolly Hard-on give you a hard-on when she's on TV? Huh? Come on, I really wanna know, does she? Give you a hard-on? Now I just want an American family. Like the Leave it to Beaver show? Weaver looked at me like I wasn't even an American. What does he know? What Americans are. We always have each other, right? We'll always be together, that's no problem. - Kim-- - It's no problem at all. It's really important, Hawk told me a story. - Oh yeah? - He told me that Jumping Mouse went on an adventure across the prairie. Aw, don't worry, don't worry. That Dumb Mexican Indian just busted his ass, that's all. No, listen. Yes, I am, it's better dead than red. Better red than dead. - Come on, we gotta go to bed, come on. Get up and do this, come on. - Better red than dead. - Gotta get up. - Gotta, sign, signed and get up. Red than dead. Kim, did you ever hear the story-- - Sure. - A story of the power? Story? About three blind mice. # Three blind mice # # See how they run # See how they run. # They all went up to the # Mexico. Come on, Kim, let's, come on-- See-- Come on listen. Come on Kim, it's important. Come on. - Did you ever see such a sight in your life? As three blind mice? Okay, Kim, just go to sleep. Paul? How old are you? 15. No one's 15 anymore. Dolly. Dolly Parton, no one's 15. Dolly Parton. Superman! Better red than dead, better dead than red. My shoe, ah. At the foot of the sacred mountain he found many things to investigate. He saw a wolf wandering there, and it seemed strange, for the wolf walked in circles. Jumping Mouse said to himself, the wolf is lost. I cannot bear to see a being so great suffer. I shall give him my eye so he can regain his memory. As he said this, his eye flew from his head and made Wolf whole again. Tears of thanks fell from the wolf's cheeks, but our little brother could not see them, for now he was blind. I'll take you the rest of the way to the path of the mountain. There, everything in the world is reflected. Brother Wolf led Jumping Mouse to the medicine lake, and they drank together while Wolf described the beauty, then he left to guide others. Jumping Mouse was alone and friendly. He felt the shadow of the hunter on his back. He was struck, and then he went to sleep. He awoke, and to his surprise, he could see. "I can see," he cried. A great wind caught him and he was lifted high above the medicine lake. A voice spoke out. You have a new name. You are now, Eagle. # Ooh # # Ooh # # Ah ah # # Ooh # # La la la, la la # # The smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised # # The smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised # # Ooh # # Too late # # Ooh # # I said # # Kissing and runnin' # # Kissing and running away # # Kissin' and runnin', kissin' and runnin' away # # Ooh # # Senses be praised # # Ooh # # Senses be praised # # Ooh # # Ah # # The bad, the bad, the bad # # No one will stop you and nothin' will stand in your way # # You're learnin' # # No one will harm you, no one will stand in your way # # No one will harm, nothing will stand in your way # # Nothin' # # There's nothin' # # Na na na na na na # # Na na na # # Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah # No, Paul, not good for you.

Would you get that camera out of your mouth? You're gonna eat it, I'm gonna make you eat it if you don't watch it. Mika, can you talk, do you know where we are? Do you see any signs, what's goin' on? Get that, look, I'm thirsty.

Sunday, heroic new story with Hollywood's biggest stars - Coke? - On the celebrity-- How 'bout a beer? Try Coors. We wanted Cokes. Sorry, ma'am. I don't know how to make Coke. We need some water then. Three? Three waters? Shut up! Yeah, I'm an irrigationist! And uh Mike, he went into town, left me here. A daring world first. Goddamn TV. No ice! Dammit. Pardon me. TV throws me. You're all set? Some problems never seem to go away. No charge, it's on the house. Well now. God dang it, goddamn TV, goddammit! Son of a bitch, goddamn TV! I'm a victim of circumstance. I don't think Mike's gonna understand. Paul, why'd you have to tell that nut that we'd stop and look at the zoo? Look, I'm not even gonna get out. A zoo? I don't see a zoo. Over here, he had a goddamn... Yeah, it was a half-breed... Maybe it was a full-blooded Indian, I don't know what kind of Indian it was, Navajo, Apache? What goddamn thing, used to have, stayed right in here. Used to take care of the snakes. Wonder what happened to that guy; he got bit or some shit. Over here, used to have one of those orange things, things throw the shit out, out the cage? Some kind of goddamn, a orangutan, keep orangutan in here. I don't know what happened to him either. I don't know what he had in here. Now we had some alligators. They went out there through that fence, over the pond, they run out in the desert out there. We got llamas, camels, peacocks, every goddamn thing he had in here. They're all loose out there. Turn it on. Okay, okay, let go. Then you turned it off, keep it going. All right, okay. We're fine, reach for the back, oh quick, oh quick. Listen, I appreciate the lift to Los Alamos. I don't think Mike, he's gonna understand this TV bit. Just wait a minute, I gotta get somethin'. I'll be right back. Just a minute, I got somethin' I gotta get. What are you, anyway? What are you guys? I mean, what distraction are you? Franco-American. One up front looks a little Mexican. No offense. My name's uh William Armstrong Custer. Cody, for short. You know, I got a whole lotta information in this suitcase. All about America. Might be of some interest to you. Especially if you care to assimilate. Might come in handy, you never know. What's the matter with the kid? Night! Yoo hoo! Yoo hoo! Yep!, boy! Up with the horny toad. Desert life does me good. Some hot java on the fire. Little domestic cooking. Mornin', ma'am, what's your name? Kim. Somethin' the matter, Kim? There's some shit in the coffee. That could be the dust from the desert. Tricky place to cook, out here. Ohayo. That's "How are you?" Ohayo. What's that? Good morning, prairie. And "genki". That's how are you? Truth Consequence. Why did you stop? Thought someone was watching. Where'd you learn that, Mika? I don't really remember anything, just the words. And the movement. You mean like Charlie Chan? No, Paul, that's TV Chinese. You do a pretty good job cleanin' up. I guess you're sort of leader of this group, huh? I was wonderin', 'cause Somethin' shoots up my spine. General Custer, he suffered from the same thing. What's the matter? It's nothin'. It'll pass. Hey! You cured my hemorrhoids. She cured my hemorrhoids. # Ba ba bow bow wow wow # # We're off to see the wizard # # Wonderful wizard of Oz # # He is a wiz, a wiz, a wiz, if ever a wiz there was # # If ever whenever a-- # You people are pretty decent. Too bad I gotta go. Could be the sort of people that could really work a spread, I mean... The kind of people that'd be grateful for a place to lay their head down. Well I guess that's what America's all about. Well, I gotta get to Los Alamos, so I can get to Truth or Consequences. Did you say Truth or Consequences? Yeah, sure did. Got the deed to my-- - You know how to get there? Sure do. If a bug knows how to fart, I can get us there, Kim. I been all around this country. # Elijah # # Ah # # Oh she were an old pine tree # # Elijah was put in a cannon by the shore # # Fell in love with an Indian maid # # Over at the antique store # You sure you don't have a little Mexicali in you? Course, people used to ask me if I had a little Mexican in me. I always say no, but I've had a little bit of me inside a Mexican. Yes, sirree, I got this picture of the first American to land on the moon. Ain't that somethin'? Man on the moon. There is no man walking on the moon. What do you call that? How did he get there? Rocket! How does it hold him up? Shit, don't you watch the news? What news? CBS, Barbara Walters, they all talked about it. Was CBS on the moon? Was Barbara Walters? You don't see that? You don't see a man walkin' there? You don't believe it? I don't see a man. I see a photograph of a gray place. Cody you're a cowboy in a bucket hat. I see no man on the moon. Shit! Hope you can cook. Ever since I can remember, it's just been my brother and me. We lived in a small. Our parents had gone to America. But they would send for us when they could afford to. They used to tell me stories they said came from the ground. Ancient heroes. Once I planted a watch. I thought that it would grow a tree of watches. I wanted to sell the watches and build a house for my mother and father and brother. The man who fed us. But my brother stole the watch. He came into the room and pulled my brother out. I can still hear him yelling, as he beat him. I thought they had killed my brother. There was a wind and a white rose. I see it like a Japanese film. The white sheet covers the half of the bird cage. There is a child running behind her. I remember. I think I am a child. Now there is hope for bird. He seems crushed. I remember the smell of the inside of a steel boat. Men were standing together at the rail. They were in white. We were one of the only white families living in a black ghetto called Hunters Point. My father once pulled my mother off a runaway horse. He got a job clubbin' cows in the slaughterhouse. He'd bring home plastic bags full of brains and tongue. He loved animals. That's why he started drinking. It took me and my two brothers to break a bottle of rubbing alcohol from his hands. House we lived in was three rooms in the shape of an L. I had to pass him every time I went out. Hey, yellow hair! Come out and fight, you son of a bitch! He'd go down in the basement. Sing Hank Williams. He'd go runnin' out on the front porch, a bottle in one hand, a Winchester in the other. "I'll kill you, you little niggers!" "Go ahead, white motherfucker." They knew he had no bullets in the gun. Once I watched him stage Custer's Last Stand outside the baseball park. I watched him hold up the traffic. Spin on the crowd. I watched my friends laugh. The cops laughing. I've got his jacket on. His feet, his legs, filled with alcohol. Inside his jacket, I've got his chest. And inside me, his cancer. It's like he's all over me. Rubbin' cheek to cheek. Get offa me. We had to hold out till the road forged on. Hey! Head 'em up, come on! Are we goin' to El Paso or what? We had to hold out till the road forged on! Hey. What's that? Nice photo. You don't talk too much, do you, kid? Look at that! Snap it. I'm gonna add this one to my collection. Woo. I guess this is your way of socializin', huh? No, it's my way of seeing. I wish I could force him to shut up. I wonder if he really knows where he's goin', anyway. Think he knows how to get to Truth or Consequences? I guess that's all that matters. One more price to pay for a better life. Mika, what are you talkin' about? We agreed on this together. # I'm a Yankee doodle dandy # # I'm a Yankee do or die # Do you know any other songs? Back here in two hours. Here, hold that. Okay, let's go. What? What? I don't know what you're saying. Hey what are you doing? Come on, give me a break. Those damn kids are annoying me. Yeah, I hate kids. Hello. - Well, I didn't Oh, that's all right, come on over here. Sit right down. Now, what did you have in mind? Now I'm sayin' if you can look inside, if you can partake of the inner search. And I'm askin' you to reach down inside yourself and understand that it's a great and a mighty world in which we've been blessed to live. There ain't no point in cryin' over spilled milk. Anything you wanna make happen. You gotta work for it, don't you? I mean that's a simple thing, you learn that in school. People out there that need an example to follow. I'm talking about poor people. I'm talking about backward people, people out of reach the voice of the Lord! Give 'em some music, Mom. How many of you have done work for the Lord Jesus? Have driven for the Lord Jesus. Do you understand what I'm talkin' about? I mean, I mean, drive for the Lord Jesus. I don't mean just talk about Jesus! I'm not talkin' about signin' your name to some little piece of paper about how much you really believe in Jesus! I'm talkin' about drivin' for the Lord Jesus! I mean, I'm talkin' about gettin' down behind the wheel and makin' that thing move, makin' it move for the Lord. Makin' Christianity a force once again to be reckoned with! That's right. My mother knows what I'm talkin' about. I mean, we're talkin' about gettin' it into gear, I'm not talkin' about movin' that car slowly. I'm not talkin' about first gear. I'm not talkin' about second gear. Heck, I'm not even talkin' about fourth gear! I'm talkin' about overdrive, do you understand? I'm tryin' to ascertain a sign I see comin' down from on high. 'Cause I believe we have a miracle come upon us today. I seen a miracle. Because it seems we have a stranger in our midst. I reach out to him. And I think this lost person here just might know somethin' about gratitude, about how very special this country is. What is your name, Miss? Oh don't be afraid of me, young lady, I'm a minister of our Lord Jesus. Do you speak English? Well that's okay, I understand. There's a greater language that we all speak. Now please, I want you to trust me and I want you to follow me. You're gonna come over right this way here. You just walk on with me, you can trust me. Now we're gonna see if this here little girl can start this car here. It's so easy, really anybody can do it. Anybody who's privileged, that is. To understand the words of the Lord. Now it's really very simple. I just want you to get behind the wheel, and I just want you to do it, okay? Anybody else here man enough to try drivin' this car, okay, get in there. It's a car of God, I wanna see you drivin' it. Son, remember, this is all for Jesus. Get in there, give it a try. See what you can do. Oh, Jesus praises us all. It's a glorious day here for God.

I did. He always spoke Mexican. He used to always talk about going back to that godforsaken place. His Mexican name was Ho-neek. He used to get drunk a lot. And tell Mexican stories. One night, he didn't come home. He got killed. Wiped out in a car. He blew it and left me here. One dumb bastard. Sounds like he loved you. How would you know? Come on, we're wasting time; where's Paul? I'm here. You are one strange kid, you know that? You know, I think I'm the only one who's got a hold on anything around here. Now let's go.

Well Mika, you always gotta think of somethin', don't you? You're always so serious, aren't you? Look, I don't care what you see out there. And why can't you speak American? You know there's a lot more to it than just getting these papers. You know, you gotta learn how to shake hands, smile. Look decent once in a while. I know what you're thinking. That I'm Mexican and I've got no right. Well, I'm gonna tell you something, at least I try. If it wasn't for you hanging on, maybe it'd work out! Why can't you talk? Can't you speak? Why don't you say something American? Like Mickey Mouse, come on, say it. Say it or leave it! You wanna live here, don't you? You know what? You look just like a slaughtered Chink. A nameless victim. You just let them kick you around, don't you? Look, that Tai Chi shit is not gonna do you any good here! It's rough out here. There are horns on the cactuses, horns on the toads. You gotta defend yourself a little bit. Say it, say something! Can't you speak a little bit? What's wrong with you? Say Mickey Mouse! Say it, Mickey Mouse! Get away! Get away from me! Leave me alone. You'll never be an American anyway. Look at you! Look at your hair! You, look at your body, your shape, you've got none, no tits. No man is ever gonna like you, you know that? So speak, talk!

They have to be on their own way. Hawk is it true that when kids die, that they turn into birds? I don't know, Paul. Hawk, is it true that dreams die? When dreams die. When dreams die, they awaken, Paul. We're not moving. Why aren't we moving? Mika! If we're ever gonna get outta here, we have to move, Mika. I don't even know where we are. Let's just go back, Kim. You promised! We just have to get those papers, trust me. I don't see how we're going to build a home with a piece of paper, Kim. Hey Kim? Yep, we're so close I can smell it.

Kim, it's important, Hawk told me a story. He said that Jumping Mouse went on a journey across the prairie. Don't worry, Paul. # Land where my fathers died # # Land of the # # Home # # Of the # # Brave # And there they drank together from the beautiful waters. Now Jumping Mouse was alone, and trembling. The hunter hid and he went to sleep. He awoke, and to his surprise, he could see. "I can see, I can see," he cried. A voice said, "You have a new name. "You are Eagle." # Somewhere over the rainbow # # Way up high # # There's a land that I heard of # # Once in a lullaby # # Somewhere over the rainbow # # Skies are blue # # And # # The dreams that you dare to dream # # Really do come true # # Someday I'll wish upon a star # # And wake up where the clouds are far # # Behind me # # Where troubles melt like lemon drops # # Away above the chimney top # # That's where # # You'll find me # # Somewhere # # Over the rainbow # # Bluebirds fly # # Birds fly # # Over the rainbow # # Why then, oh why # # Can't I # # If happy # # Little bluebirds fly # # Beyond the rainbow # # Why # # Oh why # # Can't I #
