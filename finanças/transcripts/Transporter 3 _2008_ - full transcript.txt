We'll arrive at the port in a couple of hours. Very good. You're welcome, Sir. Never smelled anything like this. Not even when you're in the crapper! What? Your shit smells like roses? Look. Give me a hand. I thought you said it was booze? - That's what the papers said. A breach below deck, Captain. Where exactly? - Area 101. Take the wheel. - Yes, Sir. - Fuck. Close the door. - Get the masks. Holy shit. Take care of them. Good morning. Morning. - Passport, please. Rough seas? - The party was a bit rough. If you know what I mean... - Ibiza? - Yes. Thanks. When I was a kid, my father used to take me fishing. Never could figure out how he knew where the fish were. Yet they were always exactly where he said they'd be. Security check. - Do I look like a risk? Please step out and bring your documents to the office. My documents are here, Sir. - The computer is in the office. Her, too. - She's sleeping. With her documents. Okay, sure. What's going on? You'll lose it. You're close, Inspector. That's a big one! Go left. Go left. Don't let him get away. You're close. Go left! Go left! Go right! Must have hooked Moby Dick! Need some help? - No thanks. I've been fishing these waters since before you were born. You're close, Inspector. Very close! A good thing we French have a highly developed sense of humor. The French think Jerry Lewis is a genius. Jerry Lewis is a genius. - Dean was the genius. Dean just stood there with a drink and a cigarette. Exactly. Anyone can fall down and get a laugh. But not many can, standing still with a drink and cigarette. Yes. Yes. Tarconi. Okay. I'm afraid our day of leisure is cut short. Chaos in Marseille. Some madman is racing an Audi through the city. Don't look at me. That is the first place the boss said I should look. But I will tell him you have the perfect alibi. As usual. Wow, Tarconi! Please. - I am sorry, Frank. It's our first bite. - Yes, yes. Please. Stop the boat. No, Frank. - Come on. Please. AIRPORT Stop. Stop. Purpose of your visit, Mr. Johnson? Business. - What kind of business? Environmental protection. Proceed. - Thank you. Mr. Minister, tomorrow you open the EU conference on industry and the environment. What has top priority on your list? - It's a short list. It has only one item: the environment and how to protect it. Given the growing economic pressure on global industries, that goal sometimes comes up against harsh realities. Not as harsh as a polluted and uninhabitable planet. Gentlemen, excuse me. I have trees to save and industrialists to disappoint. Your speech for tomorrow. - Any good? It will piss off a lot of people. - Excellent. Hello? Mr. Minister. Who is this? - My name is not important. I'm in charge of the negotiations you're engaged in with ECOCORP regarding their license to do business in the Ukraine. You must be misinformed. Negotiations are over. Permanently. I think you will reconsider once you have studied the documents in the envelope. I'll be in touch. Marseille Emergency Services. There has been an accident. Send an ambulance. 8 Route de la Falaise. Malcolm? Malcolm? Malcolm? Malcolm? I asked for a price. What's this? - The man who will do the job. He's your man. My boss says you're our man. - Your boss got his facts wrong. Two things to note about my boss: He is never wrong and he never takes no for an answer. - There's always a first time. Well... not this time. You don't want to do this. You're in no position to tell me what I do and don't want to do. You have ten seconds to change your mind. You have five seconds to remove your hand. Malcolm? Malcolm. Do you hear me? I said drop in anytime, but I didn't mean... Nowhere else to go... - Just take it easy, okay? Don't move me. Just until the ambulance comes. - No ambulance. You need a doctor. You've been shot. Not away from the car! Relax. Just stay calm. You'll be fixed up in no time. Come on. Quick. He's inside. Quick, it's serious. This way? Sir? - Be careful, moving him. Yes, Sir. We know ourjob. Sir? Can you hear me? - The car... No. If you hear me, press my hand. The car. Careful. Hold this, Francois. Put him in. Am I in heaven? No, in a bit of the shit. You help me out of it? Depends on how deep you're in. - Don't trust anyone. Couldn't agree with you more. Come on. - No. Don't leave the car. What's so special about the car? - Not the car. I told you. Don't trust anyone. I told you. I took the liberty of bringing your suit. The one you wear when you're working, right? - Right. But I'm not working. See, boss? I told you. - Please, Joseph. Your approach was not successful the first time. Thank you. We came to you in good faith. As you were unavailable, we took the man you recommended. He proved ineffective. And now, I am left with unfinished business. And I hold you responsible. I understand your point of view, but I'm still unavailable. Boss, can I say something? Anyone else want to say something? Good. Find me a smarter one. You have three seconds to change your mind, or be permanently unavailable. One. Two. On one condition. I'm listening. I drive my own car. Deal. We took the liberty of bringing your car along. Changed the oil, tuned the engine, took out the non-essentials. Left the switch over license plates. We love that. We replaced your GPS with one pre-programmed by us. Why do I insist on using only the best man for this job? We're playing in a much larger game. Don't think of this as just another job but as... a mission. I'm pleased to find we share the same approach to work. We both know a deal is a deal. We both dislike names. We want to know nothing except that which we are paid to know. Those are your rules, right? You forgot one. I work alone. I thought you might like the company. You want me to complete a mission. You're right. I do. Wait. You want to change the rules? Every rule has an exception. Let's make one for today. You're the boss. Anything else? The jewelry. Anything I should know? Remember those jokers who tried to blow up airliners by combining liquid explosives? Same principle, just refined. At 25 feet from the car, the yellow light comes on, signaling the first liquid is ready. At 50 feet: orange. The second liquid flows into the chamber. At 75 feet you'll see red: bang! Time to go. This will reach only one number. Mine. Call me after you pass the first toll on the road north, okay? Money for gas and food. Any other questions? Would you mind buckling your seat belt? I don't suppose you want to tell me what this is all about? Great. Ocean Pearl requesting cargo clearance. The papers are with the environmental agency. Drop anchor and wait to dock. We 7! inform you when they are signed. - Okay. I know what happened to you, but what happened to Frank? Colonel Medved at Intelligence has been given all the information. He knows it is top priority. He's put his best men on the job and will keep it very low profile. He suggests you buy as much time as you can. Shall the lab start examining the car without you, Sir? Yes. Tell them I'll be over once I'm done here. Yes, you can begin. Shit. Move it! Hey, I'm a cop, what the... Look. I don't know how you're involved but you must know more than I do. So why don't you download me on what you know? I know nothing. How did you know Malcolm? - I didn't. Just happened to be in a car with a man you don't know? I am now in a car with a man I don't know. Aren't you supposed to make a call? Nice to hear from you. Skip the pleasantries. Just give me the code. 1-1-2-6. Call me when you arrive. What's in Budapest? Goulash, beer. Alright. Let's rewind to the start and introduce ourselves. And your rule of no names? I'll suspend it temporarily. I'm Frank Martin. And you are? What does my name matter? Well, we are in this together. No- We're wearing explosive bracelets and heading for the same place. That puts us in the same situation. It does not. They are going to kill you. I'm aware of that. And, in all probability, you are next on their list. Now, if I am to prevent that, I could use some help. From the top: We have this problem... You think I don't know there's a problem? Do I look stupid to you? I didn't say you were stupid. We have a problem and you are not helping me find a solution. I don't want to talk anymore. Fine. What did you say your name was? Frank. Frank Martin. Frank Martin. Valentina. Pleased to meet you! Inspector, the GPS is missing. Inspector? - Yes, the GPS is gone. The gentlemen from ECOCORP are here. Show them in. Gentlemen. Mr. Minister. We would like to thank you for reconsidering our proposal on such short notice. - You make it very hard not to. We have a reputation for not taking no for an answer. Here are the contracts. All in order. The ships cannot be cleared unless you sign them personally. Ships? I thought there was only one. - Well... You see, to make this venture more profitable, we of course need to process large volumes of the material. How many ships are we talking about? - With the one at the port? Eight? Eight! This year. Protecting the environment is a long term commitment. You've said so yourself. - And I will say it again tomorrow. In Odessa. Where I will also sign these. We were really hoping to settle the matter today. I want to review them, now that there are some addendums. 24 hours won't make any difference to a long term commitment, will it? No, of course not. I'll see you in Odessa tomorrow. Let's say 9 am. Yes. Okay. I'll stay. But the material is leaking badly. - And? We won't be able to hide it. - I'll take care of that. If ever they check... - The deal will be closed very soon. - 24 hours. No more. Yes? - I managed to buy you another 24 hours. You have until 9 am tomorrow. That should be more than enough. Do you have a lead? Better than a lead. A location. Inspector? - Yes. Interpol answered your query about the license plates. This is from a radar control on the road to Rohrdorf. Let our German friends know. - What shall I tell them? No idea. That they should expect me for dinner. I'm hungry. We're still 80 miles from beer and sausage. I don't like sausage. What would you like? Veal. Roasted, with carrots and beets. In gravy with Madeira in stock. - No starter? A salad. Greens tossed with balsamic. From Modena. Aged? - Of course aged. And for dessert? Sacher torte. With whipped cream or without? With. And to drink? Wine. A Tokay, perhaps? Ice wine. Of course. What are you doing? - See a man about the jewelry. He's gone off course. Send someone to get him back on. Don't kill him. Frank. It's good to see you, my friend. Good to see you, too, Otto. - Oh... You didn't mention you bring company. It's not really company. It's... complicated. With you, it's always complicated. Tell me about it over schnitzel and potato salad. Otto, I love your schnitzel but I need to get rid of this first. - Oh. Wonderful. Binary free form magnetic resolution technology. English, please! The Pentagon is funding a program through one of its front companies, which has been experimenting with a new type of weapon based on magnetic attraction. Very hush hush stuff. You're in on Pentagon hush hush? - Incredible, what you stumble across in the Internet. Want to see the invasion plans for Iran? Maybe some other time. First I must get rid of this, before it blows me to Iran. I won't bother you with details but normally, there's a transmitter plate nearby. You should not be doing this. You're offering me advice? Not advice. A warning. A little late, don't you think? I agree with you. You're off course. Should I? - Keep at it. Look, fellas. Some things in my car needed checking. In my profession, a man is only as good as his car. It's a case of teamwork. The boss says get back on course. Frank? Keep at it. Back in the car, Frank. - No. You find it? - Not yet. You're the smart one? - No. I'm the big one. Not so big anymore, are you? Found “Vt. The transmitter. - Can you remove it? It's wired in. If I do: kaboom! You fight good. But you tie bad. Where are you going? - I'm tired. That's why I prefer to deal with cars. Makes two of us. What do you want me to do when they wake up? Probably best to take the rest of the day off. I'm not amused. - You'd be less so if you're dead. I know you need me alive. If I'm to complete this job, I need clarification. I'm listening. In person. We've already done in person. - Not yet to my satisfaction. And my satisfaction should be your main concern. Same place, in one hour. Wait for my call. Hello? You've disappointed me. You're not the first and you won't be the last. I wanted to meet you in person. That won't be necessary. Since our first little chat I realized that I don't need the best man for this assignment. Anyone with a driver's license will do. So, in the words of the great Donald Trump, I'm sorry, but you're fired. Who are you? Your new chauffeur. - I want the old one back. He's about to go to pieces. Stop the car! Stop! Stop! Stop! Goddamn! You're fired! How was your nap? - Good. How was your phone call? Brief. Fasten your seat belt. Tarconi. - It's me. Oh, I was wondering when you would call. I've been busy. - Let me guess. In Budapest? You've been busy, too. Never a problem keeping that way with a friend like you, Frank. So tell me what you know. There's a black Mercedes in Budapest, not occupied by friends of yours. That's all I know. And you? I've two bags in the back and a girl in the front. Russian, I think. No idea what her role is in this. Have you tried asking her? Why didn't I think of that? - Sorry. What did she say? That I will die. - Typically Russian. They are so dark. I remember reading Dostoyevsky in school and wondering, when do these Russians laugh? Page after page of misery, like you wouldn't believe. - This is no time for literature. I'm blinking. - Is that code? No, some bracelet they accessorized us with. Wired to explode if we get too far from the car. They? Some American. - Can you be more specific? A name? A number? - No. Why do you always make it so easy? It's my nature. - Where are you? I will come. Not a good idea. I'm on a short leash. I can't be of much help, if you do not give me something. How close are you to a computer? Yes, Frank? That wasn't very nice of you. You broke the rules, not me. Point taken. now we're even. Shall we start with a clean slate? Is this a kiss-and-make-up call? More or less. You can deactivate the bracelets and I can deliver your goods. New coordinates: 2-6-12. That'll take you to where we can conclude this deal satisfactorily. I look forward to that. Frank? Did you get it? We got the signal. We'll soon have him. Your new cell phone, Sir. Anything else? - No. Frank. Do you know where the signal is taking you? I know a restaurant there. Fish like you've never had. Grilled, with carrots and black pepper. Romanian wine is not so good. But for a last meal it could be worse. You really should begin to think more positive. I'm a realist. My friend was right to say you're all doom and gloom. What does that mean? That you only see the horrible and the terrible. Where does he get this from? He does not know me. He was talking about Russians in general. I am not Russian. I am Ukrainian. Excuse me. - Not excused. We are different people. Here. And here. Personally, I think there's a bit of an optimist in you. How you can say that? You do not know me. I see you putting makeup on. If you're convinced we're going to die, why bother? What does looking good have to do with dying? Hello. What's that? - Souvenirs from Ibiza. Want one? No, thanks. And neither do you. We need to stay sharp. Okay. You stay sharp. I stay, how did you say? Optimist? Give me that pill! Give me that! Jesus! Great. Just great. - Come on, Frank. Lighten up! - Me? That stuff will light you up like a Christmas tree! - That'd be nice. Boring. Boring. Oh, cool. You should stay in the car. - Want me to pee in the car? Okay, go on. But remember! Don't... Don't. Oh, no. Stop that. - Why? I don't drive. I want to have fun, be happy. You should not be so serious. It's important to think positive, like you said. Drink with me, Frankie. - I don't want to drink. Who's all gloomy and doomy now? Did I say it right? Come on. Get in the car. I am free like a bird. The girl! Come on! Faster! I lost my friend. I'll buy a new one. Any idea why we have a car on our ass? I don't know. Don't care. Turn that down! - First I'm doom and gloom, but now you say I can't be happy? Yes, Frank? - I thought we had an agreement. We do. - So why am I being followed? I have nothing to do with that. Perhaps someone else has issues with you? It's likely. It seems there are other forces at work here. I'll see what I can find out. And in the meantime? - Drive faster. What the hell is he doing? No- There. Down there. I'm hungry. - You should've bought a sandwich instead of vodka! Look! I wasn't hungry then. Why are you so mean to me? I'm not. I'm preoccupied. - What does preoccupied mean? That's what it means. Shoot the tires! Get him! Get down. Shoot him! What the hell...? Stop the car! Oh shit! What are you doing? - You are so tense. You don't say. I make you relax, okay? - Yes. I am good at this. Making tension go away... What are you doing? - I want to have sex. One more time, before I die. Don't you? What is it with you and dying? Is there something wrong with me? Am I not sexy? - Yeah, you're sexy. You are the gay? - No, I am not "the gay." I don't mind. I'm not. Okay? Then what is the problem? Did it ever occur to you that I'm not in the mood? I thought the rule is: Don't open package. - It is. Why have rules, if you break them? - I ask myself the same thing. Phone books. You're the package. - Yes. You could have said something. - Would it make difference? Yes. Now what are you doing? - You know, in the garage? It really turned me on when you took off your clothes. That was pure self-defense. Where's the turn-on in that? You think it is only men who get turned on by striptease? I don't like where this is going. - Would you striptease for me again? Give me the keys. This is not funny. - You want the keys? Stop playing around. It's perhaps our last chance to play around. This is not the time or place for games. For you, I guess it never is. - If I want to be analyzed, I'll see a psychiatrist. Now give me the keys. Come on, Frank Martin. Make playtime for me. Alright. That enough? That's not a striptease, Frank. A strip is sexy. Move your ass a little. Come on, Frank Martin. You want the keys? I want the strip. Know what I'll do to you for this? - Spank me? For starters. - Tie me up? You'd like that, wouldn't you? - I like... the rough stuff. Really? But not too rough. The deal was a striptease for the keys. New deal: Kiss me for the keys. Like you mean it. Do you ever kiss like you mean it? I think maybe not. I think you live alone. Inside and outside. It's not dying you're afraid of... it's living. Live with me. Just this once. Just this moment. Live with me. What's his position? We've lost him. He's in the mountains. Our equipment can't track him there. Hack into a military satellite. Yes? You think we're playing games here, Mr. Minister? What are you talking about? About a black car, full of your incompetent agents. Another foolish move and you'll lose your daughter forever. I want to hear her voice. - Only when you've signed. I want to speak to her first. - You're in no position to play hardball, Mr. Minister. - Neither are you. Mr. Johnson. Yes, I know who you are. If anything happens to my daughter, I will do everything in my power to find you and make you pay. In the most hideous way. We have to move, now! Pick up, Frank. Pick up! I'm on Ibiza. On holiday. I'm given a glass of champagne. I drink. Then I don't feel good. I go to the bathroom and next thing, I wake up in a car. I ask him what is this? He says he is only the transporter. He is a pretty good driver. Not as good as you. I tell him, "Please! My father is a powerful man, has big influence, knows a lot of people. Let me call him." He is afraid. Has never done this before. It was supposed to be simple: Pick up, drop off, easy money. He's been told: "No calls, never leave the car." But I convince him. I call my father, but before I can say where we are... Inside the car, come. Come on. We got away but... These men are shooting at us. Why? Why are they shooting at us? He explains, they're shooting because we didn't stick to the plan. I say, okay. That was the old plan. What's the new plan? He says he has a friend... And then I met you. Then I felt it's going to be okay. You didn't even know me. Of course. But I am talking about feeling, not knowing. If you felt that way, you had a funny way of showing it. Better for a woman to have a little mystery to her. No? No- Yes. Just a little. He's back on the radar, Sir. Yes? Where are you? - On the way to Bucharest. Change of plans. Your new coordinates are 3-7-13. Excuse me, Mr. Minister. Just one moment, please. Inspector Tarconi from Marseilles. Or rather, a village near there. - What do you want, Inspector? A word with you. - I have no time. It's about your daughter. Odessa, Frank. My country. You take me home! Thank you. What happened to Bucharest? Change of plans. - It's a good change. I prefer Odessa. Yes. I was looking forward to the fish with carrots myself. It's much better here. You know "Chicken Kiev"? - Yes. I know a restaurant here, the best in the world. The chicken is so fresh, with butter melting on it... You can't believe it is so good. You know what I feel now? Hungry. Safe. Will it end like in the movies? Happily ever after? Tonight this will be just a fading memory. It will be me and you, laughing over "Chicken Kiev." Liar. Mr. Minister. An update, please. I will sign the contract once I've spoken to my daughter. Hello? Hello? Have that pen ready, I'll call you back. Yes? - We're closing the noose, Frank. Just make sure it doesn't close around my neck. What's all this about? The girl, her father, large amounts of toxic waste. A trade-off. His signature for her life. I have a reputation to uphold, Inspector. For 100% successful delivery. Do I detect a slight attachment? That is not the Frank I know. The man with rules. No names, no attachment. - Why does everyone talk about my rules? Frank, I've long suspected that you're a romantic at heart. Anything else? - Where is the rendezvous? I'll call you back. Yes? - We are almost at the end, Frank. Just give me the coordinates. - No more coordinates. Follow the road you are on and take the first left. I like to know where I'm going. You'll know when you get there. Don't worry. We got them right where we want them. My compliments, Frank. Our trust in your abilities paid off. Now please send the girl out. She's coming. I'm not coming. They need you. They won't kill you. But they will kill you. Do I look like a man who came so far to die on a bridge? Do I? We don't have all day, Frank. Look how many there are. They have all the guns. How is it going to be okay? I'll tell you over dinner. Now go. Go! Kiss me. Go. You'll get me killed. Now go! Get to her, you bastard. Better now, darling? Finish him. Stop! No! Frank! His beloved car will be his grave. He'll either explode or drown. Let's go. Tarconi. They have the girl. Frank? We're tracking his phone. Where are you? In a lake. A lake? Can you be more specific? There's a dam. A dam? - I know the place, Sir. - How far? - Ten minutes at least. We'll be there in ten minutes. Can you make it a bit faster? - We'll do our best. Thank you. Buy tickets for all of us. Where to? Anywhere this train is going. We need to keep moving. Why not take the cars? Another day. Sir, over there. My God. Out. Move out! Mr. Minister. - Yes? Someone wants to speak to you. Papa. - Are you alright? Don't sign. You have 15 minutes left. Did you find out what this is about? - Garbage. How much garbage? Enough to pollute half the country for the next 100 years. - Try it again. For a modern woman you are uninformed. This is the new world. Countries are an outdated concept. There are only economic realities. Profit and loss. Efficiency and waste. Think global, not local. Think this. Yes? - Where are we? We're almost there. Where? Here. He's on a train. And where are we? - Here. We can get units there. Good idea. Do that. Oh, Frank. Come on. I assure you, everything is in order. I'm sure it is. If there are any problems... - I know. You will solve them. Now, if you don't mind... Believe it or not, I'm actually a pacifist at heart. I hate violence. It creates more problems than it solves. I never wanted to do any of this. A client asked me to attain a result. So I devised a way to attain it with the least possible bloodshed, but nobody wanted to cooperate. Not you, not the first driver, not your father, not the recently deceased Frank Martin. Everyone wanted to fight. What's so funny? Hearing a dead man talking. One more step, Frank. Come on. One more. Look. It's over. Two minutes to nine. He's signed. Oh, my God! No, Frank. No. It's over, Frank. It's over. Mission accomplished. You and the girl are free to go. I'm so impressed by your talent, I'd like to offer you a position. I'm offering you one: for the permanently disabled. I hate to waste talent, Frank. But we wouldn't make a good fit. - That's right. No- You fit well. You and the bracelet were made for each other. No- No- No- You're doing the right thing. Valentina! Valentina! Am I in heaven? Looks more like hell. I don't care. As long as we are there together. Yes? Mr. Minister, your daughter is in good hands. Thank you. What are you doing? - What you said. The right thing. Excuse me, please. I have a conference to address, on the dangers of doing business with people like you. Thank you. Is the launch ready? - Waiting for us. - Time to go. Grab the log! - Okay. I just don't understand it. When I was a boy, my father and I used to catch fish here all day long. Times change, Inspector. As do people. Are you referring to me? That isn't really accurate. I drive the same car, live in the same house. I was not referring to your car or your house... The sea is so restful. Is lunch ready yet? Mademoiselle, there is a certain order to things. In order to eat lunch, one must first catch lunch. And if we keep talking, we will catch nothing. I have a better idea: Skip catching lunch and let's go eat. I know a wonderful place up the coast where they make fish stew... Incredible! They use tomatoes, onions, and a little wild lavender. And what kind of wine? A rosé. From the south. A Chateauneuf perhaps. Chilled. - Of course it's chilled. And for dessert? Subtitles Jill Denton. Film und Video Untertitelung Gerhard Lehmann AG
