THE CRIMINAL LIFE OF ARCHIBALDO DE LA CRUZ Directed by Luis Bu?uel It was during one of the violent phases of the Revolution. Everywhere banners were being raised by one side or the other. The provincial capital where I lived... with my parents was still relatively peaceful. My family was very well-off... and I was an only child. Above all, my mother adored me. I was brought up by a governess, but that didn't keep me from acquiring the bad habits of a spoiled child. I'll bring him his water. No, madam said she doesn't want him to eat too much. Very well. Archibald... Come out of there at once! Do you hear me? You'll be sorry if you don't. Come out at once! What have you been up to? I was playing. A well-bred boy doesn't do that! What if your mother finds out you messed up her clothes! My mother lets me do what I want. You should behave like a little gentleman. You're too old to do that kind of things. If only they'd spank you occasionally. What a little devil! Always getting into some mischief. But you'll be good now, won't you, my little angel? He won't be any more trouble. Where are you going? To the theatre, pet. Your father is picking me up. I don't want you to! You're not going! Don't be difficult, Archie. Don't be a bad boy because... if you are a good little boy and let me go, I'll bring him something he'll like. What? Guess. The music box! That's right! What a bad boy I have! I'll get it for you right away. Come here, our lunch is getting cold. Sit down and I'll put your napkin on. Don't be so fidgety, Archie. You're upsetting me. Your parents pay me to raise you properly. Well, they have lots of money. That's no answer. They could spend it on themselves! If you were my child... but they treat you like a 3-year-oId. Here it is, dear. Take good care of it and don't break it. I leave him in your care, miss. He won't trouble you anymore. Put him to bed at 8 o?clock. Until then, you could tell him the story of the little box. What story, madam? You know, that story. You understand what I mean? The one about the little box belonging to a king... You're late! I've been dressed for half an hour. Sometimes, you have to wait too. Hurry up, we'll be late. I'll put my jewels on. Don't bother, there isn't going to be any show. - What's that? - No show, I said. But why? Because bullets are flying in the suburbs already. It won't be long before they reach us. But there's nothing to worry about yet. Is it nothing that we can't go to the theatre? All those agitators should be strung up! Don't worry. They say General Gomez will be here tonight, he'll put them in their place. It would have to be today! Tell me the story! Oh, yes...the story... about the king who owned this box. He wasn't a king. My mother said he was! Well, that comes later on. It first belonged to a fairy. Where do fairies live? In the air, in the water... in the fire... A king ordered this little box to be made. So now we come to the king! The king had enemies he wanted to get rid of... and the genie gave the box strange powers. He could get rid of them by starting up the box. What happened then? One day, the Prime Minister, who was a traitor... said the queen was conspiring with the enemies. The king commanded her to look him in the eyes but... she lowered them and... the king took it as a sign of guilt. Without a second thought, he started up the little box and the poor queen was struck dead. But one day... The story made a deep and lasting impression on me. I owned the box now. Could I take someone's life with it? I confess I started up the box in order to test my powers. Instantly, I thought of the governess. I was convinced that it was I who had killed her. I assure you that morbid sensation gave me a certain pleasure. Of course, it is only now that I realize all that. Yes... it was a real pleasure, to feel myself aII-powerfuI. You are aware that this is a human weakness... Since my reminiscences displease you, I won't go on. Actually, I do find them distasteful. Had I known, I wouldn?t have asked to hear them. I prefer to believe that you are deluding yourself. It's imprinted on my memory like a photograph. Time has a way of distorting things. I am sure you were as good and pure as other children. I think you like to pass yourself off as wicked. I'm very far from being a saint. Sister, would you be frightened if I told you something? That depends. It's something that would greatly interest you. Well, you can tell me tomorrow. We've talked too much today, the doctor will scold us. I'll bring you your pill. I have to go to the dispensary... What are you doing? Nothing. What are you up? I must know something, sister. What is it? You always want to be in the good graces of God? Yes... I try. Well then, wouldn?t you be glad to die... since it means eternal bliss? Isn't that right? Of course...but why? I'll give you that joy. I don't understand. If you had let me explain before, you would understand now. Go on, Doctor. Excuse me. Your honor, everything is quite clear to me. I don't doubt that it was an accident... the elevator door, through an oversight, was left open. I think so too. But, why was the sister running? I can't say why. It doesn't seem extraordinary to me... still it's odd that a nurse would run to get something. Your honor, Mr. Archibaldo De La Cruz has come in. Let him wait. Do you know what room she had come out of? We couldn?t find out though we asked all the nurses on the floor. What illness was Mr. De La Cruz being treated for? Since his wife's tragedy, his nerves have been shot. I prescribed fifteen days of absolute rest for him. What's he like? A typical man of our times... a bit moody. Thank you. It's been a pleasure meeting you. For me, also. I am always at your service. Thank you. Tell Mr. De La Cruz to come in. Mr. De La Cruz, this way, please. Your honor. This is a mere formality. I hope you won't mind giving me a few moments. Certainly not. Please be seated. What can you say about the events leading to the accident? Can you add anything to what we already know? You did well to call me because I know everything. How's that? What do you know? Everything relating to this matter. It was no accident. What was it then? A crime. Please be serious. I'm not joking. Sister Trinity was murdered. Then I'll have to believe you. Who murdered her? I did, your honor. Are you insane? Up to that time I thought I was sane. I killed her deliberately and in cold blood... and she wasn't my first victim either. I don't know what you're getting at but I must hear you out. Mr. Gomez! Make a record of all this. Keep in mind that everything you say... may be used against you. Go ahead. Your honor... do you like music boxes? What? See here, now... A few weeks ago I went out to buy a piece of jewelry. It is not a very fashionable piece, but notice the workmanship without regard to the value of the stone. Let's see what you think of this rare little Italian music box. It plays a pretty tune for two minutes. Isn't it very pretty? Can you change the melody if you want to? No, sir. May I? What do you wish? Sorry if I'm being rude... but this little music box belonged to me once... I really must get it back. Well, it's for sale... I acquired it Iegally, sir, and these people wish to buy it. I'm very sorry. Permit me to explain. It belonged to my mother and is very dear to me. During the revolution my house was looted and it disappeared. Please understand, I would give anything to get it back. Without a doubt, such memories should be respected. We all have our own. Of course. That's certain. Once, when I was little, I went with my mother... Lavinia, he's not interested in your childhood recollections. I have other music boxes I can show you. Don't bother, sir. Let's go, Lavinia. Please let me explain. No thank you, sir. Well, there goes a customer. But I really couldn?t disregard your feelings. To me childhood memories are sacred. How much? 2,000 pesos... Will you take a check? Of course. We only have to look at a face to tell if it's honest. An honorable person has it etched on his forehead. - Payable to? - Bearer. Don't bother to wrap it. Does the medallion still interest you? No, not now... thank you. Who is he? Archibaldo De La Cruz. You asked too little. You could have charged him a lot more. It isn't right to overcharge. He seemed an honest man. And rich, too. For if he was poor, he'd better not be honest. Good afternoon, Juan. I'm lucky to find you in. Bring me the vase I finished this morning. I want to take it out. You eating in? No. I've baked apple tarts. Keep them for tomorrow. Mrs. Cervantes called to remind you of her invitation. They expect you for tea at six. I won't forget. The neighbor came over to complain about the smoke from the studio chimney. I'm sorry but it's my house and I won't give up my hobby just to please him. This is the last beige shirt, the others will arrive later today. Very well. Now leave me alone. I'm sorry I took so long but I had to clean it. This is the one, isn't it? Yes, wrap it up and leave it in the car, please. Hey! You don't remember me, do you? No, I don't. I thought I was interesting enough not to be forgotten. I'm sorry, I have a terrible memory for faces. But I remember you very well... and not because you're so handsome. Don't flatter yourself. Certainly not. But that doesn't mean I'm not attracted to you. - That's my guardian. - Well... Wait... Don't get the idea I'm a schemer. My name is Pat Terrazas, we met at Fat Azuara's club, where you used to gamble. That's right. I suppose you'll be there tonight? - Tonight? - Of course. Didn't you know that it has reopened? I hadn't heard. By now, even the police must know about it. Well, I look forward to seeing you there. Let me drive. Do you like my legs? My God, Patricia! This will take about a week. That way the structure will not be damaged. Just a moment, please. Excuse me. What? You'd better go, Archibaldo is already here. If he doesn't want to see me, I don't want to see him either. He knows you're married and have a little girl. So here we go again, with the same old story. - Do you need help? - No, thank you. Is this young lady a friend of your mistress? Miss Patti? She went to school with Carlota. She comes here often? Almost never. I don't think my mistress likes her much. Why? Well, it's a little... I'm so happy to see you, Archibaldo. Do you know Rivas, the architect? I've had the pleasure. - How do you do? - How do you do, Mr de Ia Cruz? What a darling little vase. Look, Alejandro! Day by day, your work improves. I'm a mere amateur. Carlota will adore it. Take it to her yourself. She's in the chapel. - Excuse me. - Go ahead. Oh, merciful, loving, sweet Virgin, pray for us... so we may attain the divine grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. - Forgive me... - How are you? Fine, thank you. How pretty it is, Archie. What lovely colors. Someday we'll have to watch you at work. I'm going to dedicate it to the Virgin. What do you think? Is there anyone better? I'm moved by this atmosphere of peace in which you live. It's like another world. Well, it won't be peaceful for long. In a few days, the workers will be in, and then... What's wrong? I can see you're worried. Yes, Carlota... I must speak to you. What's troubling you? I am not going to beat around the bush. Something very disturbing happened to me today... that stirred up very deep emotions. But that's not what I want to speak to you about. Why not? Don't you think I would understand? Of course. It's only that I don't quite know how to explain. You can be open with me. Maybe we can find a solution together. I'll try to make myself clear. You are my ideal. I know that your purity and innocence could save me... but I don't dare involve you in a tragic destiny. Tragic! Why do you say that? I am convinced that I am not like other men. I am aware of my feelings and they frighten me. Believe me... there are times I fervently desire to be a saint, at other times... a great criminal. Isn't that absurd? It seems to me that... what's wrong with you is that you're alone too much. Why don't you come to see us more often? We have a lot to talk about. Alejandro! Don't go in there! Why not? I'll go myself... but what can I tell her? You'll think of something. Carlota, your godmother has taken III. Who told you? They just phoned. We must go there right away. I feel terrible but you must excuse us. Is it serious? Well, she's very old and you know at that age... I'm terribly sorry. Don't worry. The important thing is that it's not serious. - Well... - We hope to see you soon. I'll see you out. I'll call tomorrow. Don't bother, I'll call you... Eventually we'll get together. I'll take over now. Maybe the fat man will bring me luck. That's why I'm here, Mrs. Terrazas. Place your bets! You've wiped me out, I'm a plucked chicken. Give me 2,000 pesos, Willy! Let me sit down. I really can't stand on my feet anymore. Okay, see if it changes your luck. Thank you, you're very kind. 1 7 black... Oh, these shoes are killing me! They are good ones, too. They were made for me in Paris. I bought them on the Champs EIys'es. Look, feel them. They're well made but something is wrong with them. They are fine, indeed. Willy dear, what did they cost? Patricia, please! Hurry. Place your bets! Bet on 34. I have a feeling. Good idea. Give me 2,000 more, Willy. Take them, and that's all. Two chips, Fatty. No... don't touch them, it's unlucky! Place your bets. Anyone else? Do you plan to keep my shoe as a souvenir? 23 red... double! Be a dear, give me 5,000. Let's go. I told you that would be all for tonight. You won't give them to me? Archibaldo, will you lend me 5,000 pesos? Don't bother, sir, she's not playing anymore. Let's go. I'm going, but you're beginning to get on my nerves, sweetie pie. - Shari we go ? - O.K. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen! An interesting woman, right, Archie? I could cheerfully murder her. Don't be stupid. What gives you the right... - Your money. Isn't that so? - And other things... Like what? You want to be buried with your money. It still hurts you to spend it. It disgusts me to see you act like a common tramp. I do as I please! You make me look like a fool. You can scram, little man, for all the good you are to me! I don't want you to throw money away stupidity. I don't do anything stupidity! Besides, I don't need you. - You're serious? - AbsoIutely. Then it's all over? It has been for a long time. You'll get gray hairs over tonight and furthermore, I'm going off with the first man I meet. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. No more bets! Did you hurt yourself? It was awful. Just scraped my knee. You're lucky. What a pity about the car. I don't care about it. It wasn't mine. I'm even now. I understand. Can I be of any help? I'm alone, would you be so kind as to go with me? On one condition... What's that? That once we arrive, we don't go anywhere else. Invite me to your place. I've already thought of that. Well? I was afraid you'd refuse. But I asked you. Perhaps we both had the same idea. - Where's your car? - Over there. There are times when I think life's not worth living. You're oversensitive. I'm sure that your troubles are only temporary. Who can tell? There are skeletons in every closet. You're hiding something? No, what could possibly interest you about my quiet life? - You live with your lover? - No, alone. - An apartment? - Furnished. - Any servants? - Naturally... Do they sleep in? Are you from the police? Why so many questions? I'm interested in you. - Where are we going? - To my house. - You live here? - Yes, right there. I'm expecting a telegram. Just one second. Here is the house you were so interested in. It is not really up to my standards, but people don't know the difference. Look at my souvenirs while I put these away. I won't be long. How do you like my gallery? Interesting, and full of celebrities. The only one missing is the inventor of the atomic bomb. I haven't got to him yet... But I'm still trying. And this bullfighter? It's Rivetillo! He dedicated a bull to me just before the bull killed him. I've kept you standing all this time... Forgive me. It's quite all right to sit by me. As you wish. Do you get a kick out of asking questions? - Why say that? - I find you very strange. I don't understand. I'm going to be frank. When you offered to take me home... I thought, how wonderful, I'll seize the opportunity. But in the car I realized you had something else in mind. That's right. Would you believe that it's the same for me? If you're not thinking of deceiving your friend... what's the point of this stimulation game? You'll find out. But I wonder why you came. You'll find out. But I haven't offered you a drink. What would you like? Anything... a glass of milk. What? Yes, milk. I don't touch alcohol. All right, I'll drink for both of us. It isn't really true, is it? That you really like... I swear I do. - You here? - You weren't waiting for me? Liar. As if I didn't know you... Reality? I came with another man. - I know, with A. De La Cruz. - You followed me! Tell me, didn't you do it only to make me jealous? You know there can never be anybody but you. You forgive me about the car? It doesn't matter, what's important is that we love each other. We can never love the way other people do. No. We live in our own little hell. What about him? We don't have to make a big deal out of this. Let's go! I know the situation is a little embarrassing... But we're men of the world, are we not? Let me formally introduce you, this is William Colbert... But you've already met. Pleased to meet you, Mr. De La Cruz. It's unfortunate that we're always fighting... that's why these things happen to us. Not always, Willie, just enough to break the monotony. I understand perfectly. But just one minute with her, is worth all that she makes me suffer. She's the most unreasonable woman in the world. One can't love and be reasonable at the same time. If you'll excuse me... Won't you drink your milk? I think it's time for me to go. Don't rush off... stay awhile. You're not to blame. Patricia, serve the drinks. Sit down, please. That's how she is, but I trust her. It's better to be deceived than be distrustful. Don't you agree? Yes, but I have to... No, wait. Let me explain some more. Our life has been as hell since she got her hooks in me. As you know, the man chases the woman until she catches him. Our troubles began the very day we met. She was wearing a very tight dress transparent, with flowers on it. - Remember, my love? - How couldn?t I? You were furious because my legs showed through. That proves I love you, don't you think so? Yes, my love, you know that I adore you. The two of us forever? Forever! You're going... Forgive us... I'm sorry, but I must go. Should we let him go like that? Don't blame me. Who's blaming you? Let's not start. - Don't use that tone of voice! - What tone! A gentleman to see you. You know I only see visitors by appointment. But he insists on speaking with you. He's from the police. What could he want? Tell him to come in. Sorry to bother you at this hour, Mr. De La Cruz? Indeed. What can I do for you? Are you a friend of Miss Patricia Terrazas? Yes... I mean no. We're not exactly friends, I know who she is. Until what time were you with her last night? I don't know... It must have been between 12:30 and 1 o?clock. And while you were with her, did anything unusual take place? No... let's see... I don't think this is the proper place for a formal statement. Can you tell me what happened to Miss Terrazas? Nothing much. She turned up with her throat slit. Can I have your opinion? Almost... just give me a second. You say you started to argue when Mr. De La Cruz left? Yes, sir. I told her something she didn't like. She was upset. We both got very excited. And nothing more? I confess I said a few harsh things. Then she suddenly slapped me. I pushed her away. As I was leaving, I saw that she was crying. That's all. Inspector... There is no doubt that this note is in her handwriting. Send in your report to headquarters. They?ve have it today, Inspector. Does this sound like her? 'They?ll, it's impossible for me to go on like this. ''I didn't want to look lovely in death, that's why... ''I killed myself like this. I hope that... ''my blood flows over you the rest of your life... Patricia.'' The case is solved. Lots of blood and for no reason at all. How about some coffee, Lopez, before the judge gets here? Good idea, Inspector. I won't keep you any longer. You're free to go and do as you please. Miss Patricia Terrazas was cremated yesterday Final stage in the tragic life of Patricia Terrazas Archibaldo... No, she's up already. With great pleasure. Do you wish to speak to Carlota... just a minute... What now? Archie's inviting us to supper. He wants to speak with you. Mother, you know very well I can't tonight. Tell him I'm sorry. She asks you to forgive her, but she has a headache. That's quite all right. It's better for her to stay home. Tomorrow, I definitely must speak with her. Give her my best. You're always around. You won't get out of it this time. - Let me explain... - It's not necessary. I already know what you're going to say. I don't have enough space. But then, you deserve one. Now I'll go fix your drink. I know you don't drink. I'll send for your milk right away. Is it true this place is ancient? How old is it? Well... it must be... Was it always like this? It used to be a town hall, and before that it was a bakery. Amazing! And before that? Before that, this picturesque place was a convento. What's a ''convento?'' You know, a place where nuns live. I understand...but... how many nuns lived here? How many...? Well, exactly thirty-two. I understand... were there any male nuns? Male nuns? Well, there were fewer of them...ten or twelve. More women and less men... always, everywhere. There's my cousin, I'm going to say hello to him. Excuse me. Make believe you know me. I had to get away from those people. Don't you remember me? I would certainly like to. That's why you were staring at me? Yes, and because you look so pretty. Now we're getting somewhere. Try to remember. Don't tell me you've forgotten so soon. I'm not that naive. No, really... And women should trust men... Our meeting left a lasting impression on me. What's that melody? Where did you hear it? In a music box your mother had when you were a child. Of course ! What a memory I have ! Let's be friends! Intimate friends, nothing less. But I must get back to my Yankee friends. They know their way around. And tomorrow, who do I eat? I'm paid to do this. - You're an interpreter? - And a guide. And also a model... made to serve God and you. One of those so-caIIed artists has already used me. Look who's there! My daddy has come to pick me up. Excuse me. - When can we meet again? - It won't be easy. Since you're not a Yankee or an artist, I can't see how. Where do you live? Give me a pencil. Insurgentes 408. 'La Moda EIegante''. I am there day and night, even though it's very confining. You said you'd come with some Yankees! Maybe he's a Yankee. Quit kidding. Who is he? Have you forgotten? Oh yes... what are you doing with him? I went over to say hello. He's attractive, don't you think? I can't understand why you insist on working. Now that we're getting married, it's absurd... I don't want people to say I'm marrying for money. Let me introduce you to my uncle. They're from Oklahoma. I consider it only right for a mother to be concerned about her daughter's future. Carlota, my child... Archibaldo is here. How are you, Archie ? Archibaldo has come to ask you something important and he discussed it with me first. But since you must make the decision, I'll leave you two alone so you can talk freely. Excuse me, please. You must have guessed what this is about. Yes... I won't deny it. Since the other day, I've become more and more convinced that you can favourably change my life. I am absolutely certain that I need you. If you help me, my life will not turn into a disaster. Would you consider marrying me? - To tell the truth... - What is it? I'm surprised. I didn't think you would take that decision. - Don't you like me? - Of course, I do. I feel a great affection for you but in a matter like this, I need more time to decide. - How much time? - Maybe a month or two. My proposal doesn't exactly please you. It's not that. I want to be sure and fair to you. I beg you... let me think it over. As you wish. But please, Carlota, think of my situation... and remember that you are leaving me in the dark. Have you finished talking? What was your answer, child? Everything will work itself out. Carlota is still young. Let's wait a little while. This number is very popular. It brings out your features nicety. Pardon me, May I see Miss Lavinia? Miss Lavinia? I don't know her. Do you have the right address? Yes, I was told she worked here. Here? No, sir. But wait... I'll ask the owner. Sir... Here is the owner, she'II help you. We've never had any employee by that name. They must have given me the wrong address. Thank you. By the way, where were these mannequins made? These are imported. This one was made in Mexico. It's new... made by a craftsman from Coyoacan. May I have his address? With pleasure. Please wait a moment, sir. - Are you finished? - Yes. - Then, I'll be going. - Yes, that's fine. See you tomorrow. Lavinia! How are you? You certainly have shown yourself to be resourceful. - How did you find me? - I have ways. The dress shop? Of course. I saw you there, dumb and paralyzed. Each time I see you, I like you better. What can I do for you? Will you do some modeling at my house? Could you come tomorrow? - But... are you an artist? - Sometimes. What do you say? Do you live alone? No. I live with my cousin. A girl of you age. A charming girl. Since you've given me such assurances... I can't tomorrow but, how about Saturday at four? Agreed. May I go along with you now? No... look who's over there. And he doesn't like to see me with my clients. Until Saturday then... and remember, I am punctual. Wait a minute, please. Ready? I adjusted those measurements as you suggested. - Did you increase them by 2.5? - Exactly. That's fine. How are you? Good morning. Good morning, gentlemen. - Is your mother well? - Yes, thank you. The estimate is ready. You wish to see the figures? Come in. I've been going crazy without you. You must have guessed. My love, what's the matter? Tell me! I'm here to tell you it's all over between us. Are you crazy? What are you saying? I beg you, please listen to me. O.K., tell me. It had to come to this someday. We both knew it since you wife refused to divorce you. My not getting a divorce is not my fault. My intention was to avoid hurting you. Consider well what you're saying. I've thought it over. Try to understand what this relationship means to me. I feel guilty, like a criminal and I see my mother suffering all the time. Tell me the truth. Archibaldo De La Cruz proposed to you. I saw it coming. Carlota, you can't do this to me. Just because a wealthy man offers you a bright future, you're going to forget what we share? Or, don't you love me anymore? Answer me! I haven't stopped loving you, but I can't go on like this. We must go our separate ways. Then this is the end of everything, forever? I suppose you won't see me once you're married? Naturally. I may be weak but I'm not a slut. You're going to find out you just can't drop me like this. I warn you. I'm not taking this lying down. Please, they'll hear us. We have to go on seeing each other as always. I don't know what to say. Call me later at home. Goodbye, gentlemen. Give your mother my regards. If you don't need me, I'll be going. You can take the whole day off. Yes, sir. Until tonight. Esteban, has Juan left yet? Yes, sir. We'll both be back at ten. Why, you're right on time... How very considerable. You thought I'd let you down? It wouldn?t have surprised me. You would have been angry and I wouldn?t want that. And your cousin? Let's see if she really does resemble me. In there, come with me. - Is she asleep? - She doesn't hear. - Is she cold? - It's a hot day. Cousin, let me introduce you to my friend, Lavinia. You're beginning to worry me. How did you manage to get my little sister here? I always thought she was a good girl. She was so alone and abandoned I took pity on her... and I offered to let her live with me. My parents always said that she would turn out bad. Do you think she did wrong? That depends on whether you act like a gentleman. I come from a long line of gentlemen. In spite of your doleful air, you're quite amusing. And you are the most charming woman I have ever known. I've been thinking of you since I saw you surrounded by flames. Just like a witch condemned to burn at the stake. My little Joan of Arc. Was she a witch? Those who burned her said she was. Tell me, how did that happen? It's a very long story. Look, did I come here to work, or have my leg pulled? All in good time. The servants are off so I will get you a drink myself. So, except for my cousin, we're all alone in the house? Great. Don't you think it's better... Get me the drink and then we'll talk. I didn't get lost, here I am. Without the servants, I'm a little confused, I can't find anything. Will a cup do? Can you guess which I am? Unbelievable! The dress fits her to a ''T''. As if it were taiIor-made. And your shoes. You wear lovely stockings. I also put your panties. Sir, it's either one or the other. You must decide because two of us would be too much. Don't touch me! All right now, I'm going to change. It won't be easy to get these off. No, don't! Come here. I want to keep her like this, with your clothes... I'm going to give her this. I bought it for your sister. You didn't give me time to dress her. Look how cute it is. You're really very shocking, but I'll agree because I'll come out ahead. Go into the other room while I dress. When you finish dressing, you can come in. - May I...? - Come in. Although it's not taiIor-made, it fits you perfectly. Even the quality is first-rate. I have to give you credit. That's quite unnecessary. I'm dying to find out something, but I hesitate to... Go ahead, ask... In this castle, is there no place to work but your room? I have a workshop. Let's have a drink and I'll show it to you. What's this? A memento of my travels. Take a look. There's a photograph of the place Joan of Arc was burned. Examine it at your leisure. I love to look at family albums. Now I'm sure that even as a child you were cute. And this lady, how elegant! You mother, of course. Let's see if I can find... Somebody's at the door. I don't know who it could be. I never have visitors. Shari I go see? No. It has to be a mistake. And what if it's not? I have a feeling it isn't. Wait! Welcome! Oh, I forgot to tell you. I arranged for them to pick me up here. I wanted them to see your work. They say that you're very good. We just adore Mexican art. We want to see some. Won't you show them? They won't stay long. Come in, please. Was this house a convent, too? No. There are some houses in Mexico that weren't convents. Excuse me. I would like you to explain some aspect of your art. Mr. De La Cruz is an original artist who doesn't follow rules. Look at some of his work then I'll explain. Come this way. Couldn?t you find something better to amuse them? Forgive me. I don't know what to show them. It's another of your jokes and you're going to pay for it. I'd gladly let you scold me but it won't be possible. Why not? - You won't see me again. - How come? - I'm quitting my job. - But why? Because I'm getting married. Getting married? Excuse me a moment, I have to take care of my clients. You have been most kind to let us visit this darling residence. We're terribly grateful to you. Let's go. We're in a big hurry. Let's go, everybody. So I can't see you again? No, my future is a man who will always want me by his side. But you'll have my little sister to console you. Bye. Why did you make me come here, Carlota? Sooner or later you'll have to face up to it... We'd better discuss this matter now. My future depends on it. Why else do you think I'd come here? It seems to me... Mrs. Cervantes... Carlota... what a surprise! How are you? Come in, please. I didn't expect a visit from you. Does it surprise you? An hour ago, we didn't even know we were coming. Isn't that so? What's important is that you're here. Come in. I'm pleased to see you, only, my servants are off today. It doesn't matter, we're glad to find you alone. - Sit down, please. - Thank you. Don't be surprised by our visit. Carlota has good news for you, she wanted to tell you in person. Speak up, please. You can't imagine how impatient I am. Well... I don't know how to begin... It's about the proposal you made to Carlota. You can easily understand why she asked you to wait. She finally told me today... You don't know how happy you made me. From this moment on, a new life begins for me. Is it really possible you've accepted me? I know the sorrow of being separated from your daughter... but I promise you will not be abandoned. We will live close by. I feel for you deeply, and am truly fond of you. Mother, please. I knew you'd make a scene. It's only natural for her to become emotional... It's painful to be separated from an only daughter. I want you two to be very happy. If it was necessary, I'd give my life for it ! You are a good man, Archibaldo, a very good man. Whatever Carlota may do, may you have all the good you deserve! Sir, this letter has come for you. Where's the rest of the furniture? The wedding's the day after tomorrow! - It's coming. - O.K. ''Before you get married, you must know the truth.'' ''Be at the architect's garden tomorrow.'' ''You will learn that Carlota is not as pure as you imagine.'' Leave me alone, Alejandro. Forgive me, I had to see you. To hold you in my arms. If you hadn't come, I don't know what I'd do! You would have created a scandal as you said you would. The idea of not seeing you anymore drove me crazy. Is there no way to dissuade you from this wedding? It's my only chance to lead a decent life. How can you be against that? Promise me you won't try to interfere. Yes, my love. I promise. But something has to prevent our being separated. Why do you say that? I don't know, but a love like ours just can't fade away... as if it were only a dream. Something has to happen. And I believed I'd be saved by her purity. Were I to kill her now, I'd be called a common murderer. But once we're married, I'd be a husband avenging his honor. Tomorrow night, in the bridal suite... No, don't take it off. I want to see you like this... Wearing that tiara and veil, symbols of purity... so white and transparent that one can look into your immaculate soul. I would like to see you kneeling, praying... as you did that morning at the chapel, you remember? I told you I wanted to be either a great criminal or a saint? Won't you give me that pleasure? Come now. I've seen you praying so often in my dreams. I'd like to see you as you were on that day. Kneel! For God's sake, why? Please... Kneel! That's better. Now fold your hands. That's it! Fold them! Now pray. No, no, no! In a loud voice. Say your prayers out loud. For God's sake, Archie! Won't you do this for me? May God save you, Queen and Mother. Mother of mercy. Our life and sweetness, our hope. May God save you. We are called the banished children of Eve. We send our sighs to you from this vale of tears. You are our Lady, our interceder, turn to us your merciful eyes. Show us Jesus, the blessed fruit of your womb. Oh, Clement, oh, merciful, oh Virgin Mary... pray for us that we may be worthy of the divine grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen. What are you going to do? Archie, let me explain. What happened to you? Hurry! The ceremony is almost over. Here's a place for you, Father. Thank you so much. I can't stand very long. My legs give out on me. How do you like the wedding? My, it's splendid. And so many people. That's because our friends are such fine people. I had to go out because my eyes were filling with tears. For me, a wedding, a baptism, even a confirmation... are always moving. The pomp of the Catholic church is like a blanket or poetry which covers all its aspects. It's something unique and extraordinary. How would you feel if this were a civil ceremony? It would be prosaic, common. You are right, Father. But I think that our friend is a sentimentalist. In everything and everyday, thanks be to God. For example, when I see a regiment, the colors unfurled, I feel a knot right here, and my eyes fill up with tears! That's only natural for well-born people. It's patriotism. Of course. It's over, gentlemen. Is she yours? She's a little friend. Mine is six years old. I'm taking her back to her mother. I'll be right back. It seems to be over. Alejandro, no! Once more, Fate intervened in a curious way. My plans, though frustrated, were fulfilled. Even before your call, I had decided to turn myself in. One question, Mr. De La Cruz... Do you like mystery stories? Your honor? Mr. Gomez, you may leave the room. Speaking seriously now, one thing can't be denied... You are a great criminal, that is potentially. And what about my crimes? Your crimes? What crimes? I dare say... I can't prosecute you for wishing someone's death. We have enough to do as it is. - Your honor? - Yes. Your wife is here. Have you finished yet? - In a few seconds. - Yes, sir. It was I who killed all these women. I'm a criminal. Thinking is not a crime, my friend. All I can do is give you a piece of advice. Yes, your honor. In the future, use an electric shaver. That's about all. If you'll excuse me, my wife is waiting. Goodbye, your honor. How marvelous! What are you doing here? I really can't explain it. I was wondering about it myself. I was home and now suddenly I find myself here. Isn't your husband waiting? You said you'd never leave his side. I don't give a damn about my husband! You mean you didn't, after all? As you can see. Wasn't it a good match? A rich man, respectable... Yes, but besides being rich and respectable, it turned out that he was an honorary police official and he was jealous. Enough said... Congratulations! And what about your Yankees? Not in this period. Like fruit, they have their seasons. What have you been up to? How are you? Quite well. For the first time I can say my life is uncomplicated. Well, why don't we go for a walk? Where to? To where you're going. What a coincidence! Let's go. THE END Processed by C.M.C.
