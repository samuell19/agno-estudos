Ooh, Stanley, your feet! - Warm 'em up for us. - Come on, then. I reckon that Reg would make a good husband to some nice girl. Where's a bloke like that gonna meet anybody? We managed to find each other. Sure enough. Miracles do happen. Let me go. Don't. Stop. - You're terribly beautiful, you know. - I should get a-- - I should get a taxi. - Shh. Come on, let's dance. Don't be silly. - I do apologize. - What? I haven't got a gramophone. It's not funny. - It's not funny. - It's not funny? It's not funny... Not funny? Oh, morning, Mrs. Fowler. Good morning, Mrs. Drake. Oh, I'm in your way, here? Lost something? - I am in your way, aren't I? - Oh, it's just... I can't see for looking, sometimes. I'm like that myself. Among other things. All right, Mother? Ain't you been up today? Leave it alone. You getting married yourself, sir? No, I fear. No, it'll be a sister of mine that's getting married. - Oh, lovely. - Yeah. But to tell you the truth, I haven't met her man yet. He's a bit of dark horse, so I-- - Just lower your arm for me. - Yeah. So when are you catching the boat? A week this Saturday coming. - Oh, doesn't give us much time, then. - From Holyhead, I'm goin'. Just lower your arms for me please, sir. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank you. So I'll be having the waistcoat with it, then? That's no problem whatsoever, sir. As I said, it's, uh-- we charge 10 guineas for the two-piece suit, moving up to 13 guineas for the three-piece. Well I have your money on me now, so... Oh, lovely. And I want the jacket just like the one you have on there. Well, you have chosen the double-breasted jacket, sir... - with the four buttons - Yeah. Now, the only difference is-- your lapel... is going to fasten down to the bottom button, giving it a much more streamlined effect-- Oh. And what with the light blue bariff here, plus the stripe to accentuate your height, it's bold, it's sharp, and it's certainly going to make an impression when you walk into the church, sir. Well, that's exactly what I want, sir. - Just face the mirror for me. - Yeah. - I'll be the lord of the manor in this? - Oh yes, sir. - I'll be like your man, George Raft. - You will indeed, sir. Me daddy won't know me, huh? Well, if you're going for the George Raft look, sir... we can always supply you with a pair of spats. Oh, no. No spats. Whatever you want, sir. I'm just going to measure your outside leg. Yeah. Come on. Seized up? She's there. Is Joycie all right? She's fine. We ain't seen her in ages. She's started talking about moving. Moving where? To a bigger house. Your house is big enough, isn't it? Yes. - You ain't been there a year. - I know. We had a bit of company last night. - Did you? - You know what Vera's like. She finds a young fellow, lives on his own, no family, hoicks him in with us, gives him his tea. She's got a heart of gold, that woman. - She's a diamond. - You're a lucky man. You're a lucky man in all, Frank. What she invite him round for, anyway? - He lives on his own. - A lot of people live on their own. Don't mean you've got to invite them all round for tea though, does it? It's just Vera's way, ain't it? Maybe he wants to be on his own. She wants to mind her own business. She's a little busybody, bless her. She's going to get herself in trouble one of these days. I'm glad we moved out here, aren't you? I seen the washing machine I want this morning. It's ï¿¡25. Oh no, not now, Frank. Not your accounts. - It'll take me 10 minutes. - I know your "10 minutes." An hour and 10 minutes, more like. I thought we was going to have another early night. I'll finish this and we can have an early night. All right, dear. Frank? Frank. You're asleep! Don't go to sleep on me. Frank? Well, you come on top of me then. - Come on. - Can't we leave it till tomorrow? No, we got to do it now, ain't we? Afternoon, dear. Thank you. This way. Right then, dear.

Mrs. Barnes, I've been a doctor for over 25 years. Sister and I see cases like this every weekend, - don't we, Sister? - Yes, we do. All right... someone come to the house. And what did they do? She grated pink soap into a bowl of warm water and she had a bottle of stuff and she put-- - And she used a syringe. - Yes. And no doubt, she'll use her syringe again. And again and again and again, and Sister and I will have to deal with dozens of cases just like Pamela's. Mrs. Barnes, these people must be stopped. You're going to have to inform the police. I ain't talking to them. Sister Coombes. Righty-oh. They're ready for you in theater, Mr. Walsh. Thank you, Sister. Mrs. Barnes, if you don't inform the police, I'm going to have to. Unfortunately, it's my legal obligation to do so. Excuse me. - Excuse me, nurse. - Yes, sir? We're police officers. We're looking for Sister Coombes. Oh yes, sir, just follow me. Sister, it's police. Good evening, sister. I'm Detective lnspector Webster, - this is D.S. Vickers-- - Good evening. Oh, good evening. We was sitting by the side of the road, there was bodies everywhere--stink, petrol... I'd had enough. I couldn't do nothing. Couldn't run away, couldn't cry, couldn't feel nothing-- I just sat there. And all of a sudden, there was this old girl... staggering past us, muttering in French. Guess what she was carrying under her arm? - What? - A pair of old mirrors. You ain't told me that before. We've got a lot to be thankful for. - Yes, we have. - I have. For one thing, you ain't turned out nothing like your mother. She can't help it. Did you ever ask her who your dad was in the end?
