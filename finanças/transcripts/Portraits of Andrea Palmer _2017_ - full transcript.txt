I'm Andes, I'm here for the audition. - Hi. - Hi. - Are you Jim? - Mr. Janos Hi. Come in. Watch out for the step. This way. Is this where filming takes place? Well ... yes. I mean, this is the warehouse. It is still in operation, so sorry for the scrap metal. But we have a set in the back. Go ahead, I'll guide you. Anyway, ah yes. It's part of another project, we do our performances around the corner. If you turn right here you will see that it opens. Here we are. Who else is there? Well, the other two performers are already here, but they are preparing. Oh, wait a minute He is Sunni. Sunni, she is Andes, today she will observe us - Hi. However here is where we shoot. It can be an excellent opportunity for you. Because you can observe and see how it works with some professionals at work. And since you're just starting out you can see what work is like, okay? And with that in mind, we want that you observe everything well. And if you like it, heck, you sure will the opportunity to participate. And if all goes well, you can come back and start your career. How do you like it? I'm interested. Okay, well that's why you're here. Here. Andes, I introduce you to Sheena, our actress today. Sheena, she is Andes. However, if you put yourself here you have a good view of the scene and you won't get in the way of shooting. OK it's good. Ok. Sunni. We need you on set. - I'm coming. Ok, little diva, let's put this thing, it does some color. Thanks. Great. - Now I have to go. - OK it's good. I hope it was a good experience. You did very well for a beginner. We would certainly like to have you here very soon. - OK well. Call us when you are free and we'll put you on the agenda, okay? I'll take you out. - Don't you pay me first? - How would it be? - Don't you pay me first? - For today? - Yes, what I did. - Well, you know it wasn't a paid performance, did you? - What are you talking about? Well, you only came to see if you liked it. You could not even act, you did it and it's great. - I just worked in there. I shot with the girl. - Yes I know. - I was there. I know what you did was not in the agreements. - You gave me the chance. You said that if I wanted to participate well, otherwise I would not have been obliged. I didn't say you'd get paid anyway. And I repeat it now. You can't do this! Are you kidding me? How dare you talk to me like that. You have to pay me. You gotta pay me. I didn't come here at all. I didn't come here at all, son of a bitch! Give me my fucking money! - Get out of here! - Give me my fucking money! Fuck you! Now you pay me, I'm not leaving without my money. Get out, I'm not giving you a penny. Now get the fuck out! And don't let the door slam on your ass, and throw my number! Let me in! Fuck! Cheap porn starlets. Shit. Holy shit! Fuck! 3. Sorrow of One Eye Jack - Hey, do you know where I can have fun? - Yes, well ... what are you looking for? Yes we go. See you later, friend. Well, well, well, look who's there. - Your friend stole my laptop. - What did you expect? He is a junkie. - I didn't expect to get ripped off. - You shouldn't get those shits in the house. - Why don't you invite me? - What's wrong? - I have pockets full of coke. I'll take care of you. - Here we go. Here we go. You know, this is a filthy fucking city. If you want to go around picking up customers, it is better to have fur on the stomach ... ... and don't be too sensitive. I lived around here. But I don't miss it. Nothing but assholes that run around everywhere. This is not the Mexican stuff you find around, I take this on the west side. Good girl. Put it down. I like you. You're okay. Keep it up and you will be one of my favorites. Will you be nice? I want you to be nice to me. Fucking zombie. 4. Where girls learn to piss on command Ready? Yes, I am Katrina. Yes, do you want to know the rates? Okay, that's $ 100 30 minutes ... ... and $ 200 an hour. Yes, all inclusive. More? Well, how long? All day? So let's see ... We could make $ 500 all day. I am free now. Perfect. OK, see you soon. Hi. - Alloa, how long are you in town? - Few days. - Where are you? - Somewhere in the suburbs. - How did you come here? - By bus. Today I want to have fun. Well, you want to tell me something more ... what kind of fun are you looking for? - I like to talk. - And what else? Whatever comes by itself. Ok. Apparently you've come to a point in life where you thought about placing an ad on Craigslist ... - ... to which I replied. - Exactly. What brought you to that point? I need money, I don't have any. But what brought you to this point? A guy told me I was going to have career opportunities. I flew there ... ... and disappeared. I haven't heard from him since. Did you know him? No, I never knew him. Disappeared. He tricked me. Did you pay the ticket to come here? I believed him. I was stupid, I shouldn't have believed him. But I was in a bad situation. Did you do something while you were there? No. Do you have any money left? No. I'll tell you a story about making money, since that's what you care about. I had a friend, I don't know where she is now, her name was Leslie. He once said to me: "you just have to have your pussy, and you don't die of hunger". My answer is that the only difference between a wallet and a woman ... is that you have to turn a woman over for money. Did you want a blowjob? Are you interested in sex? I'm here to talk, I certainly don't want a blowjob in the car. - Are you sure? - Well, however not now. Is that all you want to do? Do you pay me just to chat? Yes, and I think what I pay you worth the price of a chat. Women who make money tragically they end up being incredibly unhappy. True. I told you a story, now it's your turn. - What do you want to know? - You don't look happy. I don't know if I would be able to make you happy. Even by paying you, I don't know if you would be happy. I want to know why you're sad, because you seem to be sad. I have a daughter, I want her back. My sister has it. I'm trying to get back on my feet to get it back. Well as you can see this is no longer a football pitch. It was. Some time ago, when I arrived here in 1978, it was a small park. We played there every Saturday and Sunday and the holidays. Religiously. Because in some cases someone would say, always better than lying on the psychiatrist's bed. Suddenly, in 1994, there was an earthquake here in LA. I remember waking up and saying to my roommates, "I felt the field die." 4 or 5 days later I came to the camp. It was surrounded by yellow police tapes. I went in and out of the fire station they ran to tell me: "do you want to die here?" I said "yes, it doesn't matter, I like this place". And they said "take two more steps and it will happen". The football pitch was on a reservoir and it was open in two. I looked down and thought I'd jump, but then I said "No, I don't think I will." Maybe you think I'm someone who hides something. My instinct with the people I meet, for what it's worth, it's to seek to protect them from themselves. That's why I suggest you, if you like where I took you, to remember him fondly. And if you need to talk, maybe with someone you bring here, you will be welcome. Or you can call me whenever you want. Thanks. I'm here for this. 5. Pleasures between heaven and hell What are you doing here? You still owe me my fucking money. I don't owe you anything. It is I who decide. Now... you get on your knees. And suck my cock. ... until I come. Here, good. Good girl. sucks or your eyes are hollow. Do you see this? You see it? I get your eyes off your head. Suck this cock. Forward. Come on, suck until I cum. I don't want to see those tears. Shut up! Suck or hollow your eyes! Hey, come on! Take it, come on. Yes like this. So I like you, come on, we're not done yet, come on. Come on! Good girl. Suck my cock. It's not my fucking fault. It's not my fault. It's your fault. Come on, do it! Just do it! So and so. Come on, you want this or that, huh? Come on, we're almost there. Here we are, okay? Now it's OK. Now listen to me. See you tomorrow at 5 in the afternoon on the dot at Wilshire Park View. I have friends there who want to meet you. 6. Everything will be ok YOU. everything will be fine I am happy to know paradise. I'm glad I peeked into hell. I'm glad I lived. I'm glad I loved. Before the black tent falls. I am happy to be able to laugh at the throat. I'm glad you don't care to see myself like a seedy thing. I'm happy Oh, God, I'm damned so. Hi, Megan. You know I'm sober now. Yes, I have a home in LA. I have a job. I am a model. It is a kind of agency. They hire me. They will find me a lot of work. I will be in the magazines. It went like this. Can I speak to Kelly, please? I am completely clean. Can I speak to Kelly? Please. Why not? OK Bye. You are late. Come on, let's go. Do not stop. Here she is. You are a whore. Do you think that's the only thing I can do? This? Because? I said get up, bitch. I'll give you 50 bucks. You're crazy.
