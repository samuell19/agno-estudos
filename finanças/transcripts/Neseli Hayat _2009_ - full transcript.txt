R?za Abi, do something! Dance! Don't just stand there. Dance! How am I supposed to dance wearing a ton of stuff like this? What shall we do? Run? - Sure, let's run. This way. Come over here. For God's sake, Abi! You're standing there staring at the crowd! What's the deal? But these slippers weigh a ton.. R?za Abi, please! Move around a bit. Dance. OK? Dance a bit. Jump up and down. Cheer them on over there, look. - What? - Cheer on the crowd over there. You're useless, R?za Abi. Pathetic. Watch the lights. You stand there like a lump. But you see, ?etin said to dance. - OK, so dance then, Abi. I can't dance normally. How am I supposed to inside a slipper like this? If we'd been shown what to do, if we'd had some training, maybe.. Training? OK. Remind me, ?etin. We'll sign R?za Abi up for school. What school? - Slipper college.. Or talent high school. First high school, then college. Don't give me that, R?za Abi. Or I'll get you under my feet. What? Well, you're a slipper, right? ?etin, a slipper under my foot! Nice one, ?etin. The guy ribs me and you laugh. Great! If the boss cracks a joke, you laugh. Well, you kind of have to. How many bosses crack jokes at their staff? Especially these days.. Look, don't tell anyone. I mean it. I'm not coming again in any case. R?za Abi, anyone hearing you would think I'd corrupted you. We got to work. Look what the guy says to me. And you just laugh. So he's the boss. You have to laugh at the boss? Have you given up cheff?ng? It's a loser. I'm out of the restaurant thing. Let someone else do the cooking. I'll do the eating. Call yourself a brother, Ahmet Efendi? Look at the guy, Hadji! He throws his own brother out on the street. - What's going on, Lokman? - I'm no brother of yours! I have no family in this neighbourhood! It's over! Here's your dirty underpants too, Lokman Efendi! Hey, what are you doing, Yenge? Knock on this door again and I'll break your legs! You shouldn't play with a young person's heart, Ahmet Efendi! Move it, come on. What happened? I've fallen in love. The guy just doesn't get it. I promised my baby I'd marry her. What can I do now, R?za? Kill myself? Lokman? What's happened? I don't know. There was a big f?ght. Ahmet Abi kicked him out of the house. Calls himself a brother, huh? Is that what a brother is? Look, he's your big brother. Don't make such a deal of it. He whacked me three times. Look, it's bleeding. Go wash yourself, Lokman. So what's behind all this? I don't know. He said something about being in love, but I didn't get it. So he'll be staying here then. He's my brother. Where else can he stay? Well, that's what I'm saying. Oh God! Come here, Lokman. Let me take a look at you. - Ayla, can I turn this off? - I am watching it, R?za! - R?za ?enyurt? - Yes? Sign here. Thanks. Duran Abi. What's this? How about talking to a person f?rst? How about telling that person to pay you what they owe f?rst? So it's straight to court, is it? Would you have been able to pay? How can I? Didn't we go under together? Wasn't it you who got us into the Jolly Life? What's wrong with turning to the law? If you're right, it'll be done with. Well if you win, what will you want from me, Duran Hodja? Whatever we paid out. Really? All right then. See you in court, Duran Hodja. For goodness sake. Open your mouth. - What's that? Honey. Where's that come from? Nursel Abla sent it. It's really good for you. - It's worked wonders for them. - Nursel Abla sent it, did she? Ayla, do you go telling everyone about our private life? This is Nursel Abla. In two questions she knows everything. She's a wizard. Like what kind of questions? You know, when was the last time, who was the best? And then she knows. She asks who was the best? Shame on her! I'm not having any. I need my sleep. I'm not in the mood. She says everyone goes through this, that we shouldn't give up, R?za. And she shouldn't stick her nose in other people's affairs. - Lokman! - What's up, R?za Abi? - Turn out the light. OK, OK. You turn it out too, Ayla. She asks who was the best, huh? Shame on her! Here. Lawyer H?sn?.. He's a really good lawyer. Oh, ?etin. What is it? No, no. I'm not doing ridiculous stuff like that. A month? No problem. I'll see. I'll call you. I'm not calling. I'll see. OK, thanks. Goodbye. How are you doing? - Hey, ?eto! How are you doing? - Thanks. Got any phone units? - Sure. I'll f?x you 25. - Take it easy there. Where's Nihat? How are you doing, ?etin? Welcome. - Take it easy. What's up? How are you doing? The world's most painful slipper! Is everyone here? Great. Pick yourselves the right size. What's this? A month's work. Through to new year. You've landed on your feet, assholes! High f?ve... Pick one, R?za Abi. Go on. - What, one of these? - Yes. It f?ts you perfectly. Great. Put it on, Abi. Go on! The other day, one of our guys rightly raised the issue of training. We should deal with the issue right away. Why? Because it's all about acting now. I want you playing characters now. - Who are you? - Santa Claus. Santa Claus. How does Santa laugh? ?etin? Ho-ho-ho! Nice one, ?etin. You're awesome. He laughs like this: ho-ho-ho! Let's hear you then. Ho-ho-ho! Nice. Now make it sound happier, friendlier. Like this: ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho! Good. Again. Louder this time. Ho-ho-ho! Wait a second, wait. R?za Abi, let's hear you. Ho-ho-ho.. What the hell was that? Ho-ho. R?za Abi, please! Concentrate a bit. We're here to make kids happy, not scare them. Listen. Hoh-hoh-hoh! Ho-ho-ho! - ?etin, give R?za Abi lessons. - OK, Abi. I want the better guys among you to teach the not-so-good ones. In-house training. There you go! No chance! The guy has it in for me. The guy's right, Abi. Let's practise. Ho-ho-ho! That's what I'm doing. Ho-ho-ho. No, Abi. Sound friendlier. - But this gets in my mouth, ?etin. Smile a bit, R?za Abi. Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho! More like from inside, Abi. Make your voice deeper. That's what I'm doing. How do you mean "from inside"? What have you got me into, ?etin? I told you I wasn't doing anything ridiculous. Ho-ho-ho. There, I'm doing it. How else am I supposed to do it? Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho, like that? Am I supposed to frown? Abi, what's with frowning? You want to beat the kids too? God! Come on, smile, Abi! You're Santa Claus. OK. Here, ho-ho. Ho-ho. You know why I'm laughing? Well, normally you'd go "ho-ho-ho" to the animals back in the village. You'd go "ho-ho" to keep them away from the river and stuff. How am I supposed to go "ho-ho"? Ho-ho, what the hell is that? - They're paying 40 lira a day. Here you go, ho-ho. - Ho-ho-ho... Don't laugh, Abi. How can I not laugh? People are looking. Ho-ho-ho.. Oh God, ?etin! Ayla, how about f?xing your brother some eggs? - But you just had pilau, Lokman! - My mind was on eggs. R?za, it's time we went to see the girl I plan to marry. Talk Ahmet into asking for her hand and let's be done with it. We'll see, Lokman. Just eat your eggs and we'll see. Ayla, my eggs? OK, OK.. Make sure the whites are wobbly. You know, kind of like jelly. - R?za, you want some too? - No. Selam aleykum! Aleykum selam. - How are you, ?etin? - Good, Abi. Santas! Come over here. OK, see you. Good luck then. - Don't forget. Hoh-hoh-hoh. - OK, don't worry. - Emrah. Come round this way. Turn around. R?za Abi, grab Emrah. Emrah, hold on to whatever you can. Emrah.. Turgut.. - Thanks, Abi. - Nazmi.. R?za Abi.. - What's this? - The name of the shop you're going to. The ball's in your court. The job is down to you now. Don't forget, we're a team. What are we, Turgut? - We're a team, Abi. - We're a team. If everyone plays well, the team wins. You're in charge of the costumes now. Don't smoke while you're in them and be careful when you eat. Don't use mobile phones while you're on the job. Emrah, don't talk to yourself while you're on the job! Hello? Yes? Honey, how many times do I have to tell you not to call me on Emrah! So that's the deal, guys. You smile, you're energetic, you're dynamic. OK? Good luck to you then, guys. I'm going this way too. See you later Nazmi. Toyzzz... Hah! This is me. This is my place. See you later. Take it easy, R?za Abi. Good luck. - Good luck. - Go easy there, R?za Abi. Take care. - Here we go then. You take care too. Selam aleykum. Where have you been? You're an hour late. Well, the agency brought us here all together, by minibus. Come with me. Come on. He's not late! It's a whole month to go till new year. The guy's early. - Get on with your work, Pelin. - OK. The hours are 9 am to 8 pm. There's an hour off for lunch. Nil?fer has the lunch vouchers. You can get them from the till. This is where you change. OK. I'm actually wearing my normal clothes underneath. - So I'll leave the stuff here. - Where are your eyebrows, Abi? - What? - You're supposed to have eyebrows. Eyebrows? Well, they didn't give us any. Get moving, Abi. Move it. What was your name? - R?za ?enyurt. - Come here, R?za Abi. You stand here. Go on, start, Abi. OK. They showed us what to do anyway. Go on, start, Abi. Go on. Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year, everyone! Have a prosperous new year! All the best to you! Ho-ho-ho! Just stick to the "ho-ho", friend. Don't do any more. - But that's the hardest part for me. - Which part? Ho-ho. If you're asking why, back in the village, it's what we... What village? Get on with it. Come on! Ho-ho! Let's hear it. What kind of agency is that, sending us Santas from the village? Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho, little boy! Ho-ho! Aren't you washing cars any more? That's over. I'm sick of that place. I'm not working with that guy. Look, I'm the boss's brother and I'm still stuck washing cars. - I'm going to set up my own business. - What business is that? I'll look into it. That brother of ours is shady. And that's a fact. He makes excuses to his own brother, to me to keep my nose out of expenses. And he calls himself a brother! What are you doing with that? Give it right here. It's medicine, you animal. Medicine! You'll be eating us one day. Where's the lid for it? On the table. You're something else! Welcome, R?za. Thanks. - He's got worms. - What are you up to, Lokman? What are you muttering about? He was eating our honey, the animal! Our honey? Where have you been? Out working. I've started work. Work? Why didn't you say? It's temporary. Until new year. ?etin f?xed it for me. What kind of job is it? In a shopping mall. There's a toy shop in ?stinye Park. I stand there at the door. - At the door? - I welcome people, you know. Great. It seems like a jolly life. I'm going to wash my hands. My real profession is working as a chef. But I sold my wife's gold, everything we had and got the money together... ...to open my own place. I'd always worked for someone else ever since starting as a busboy. I thought I'd open my own place. And that's what I did. As soon as I'd opened people were talking about the crisis. So you see, forget the crisis, I couldn't even take talk of it. I went to the restaurant one day. Around noon, hung over from the night before. The place was empty. The staff were gone after not getting paid. I cooked a few dishes on my own. Still there were no customers. I picked up that chair and slammed it on the cash register. Then I left. And gave up on being a chef. From that day to this I've never picked up a knife again. I started hanging round the teahouse. What else can you do? Meanwhile, I was gambling a bit. Teahouse gambling, but still gambling. I mean, just a bit. The guy has all the luck. Look, there hasn't been a false joker all game. Whoa, Zafer Abi! You grabbed the good ones again. - Keep your nose out, K?ksal Abi. - There's always next time, R?za! Dear friends, give me f?ve minutes of your time... ...and your life could be a whole lot jollier. I'm not a salesman. I'm not trying to sell you anything. I'm here to offer a partnership. Abi, you... - What's your name? - Zafer. - Do you want a jollier life? - Sure. - You? - Who wouldn't? How long have you been playing Okey? - Since I was a kid. - How many hours? - Oh, a couple of hours. Two hours is such a long time, isn't it? A person's life could change. You make a decision and f?nd your life's become a lot jollier. You won't get a jollier life by playing Okey in the teahouse. But you will get it by stirring yourself and working. R?za, welcome. - Thanks. How are you? - Fine. Come in. This way. Relax. Birg?l Han?m. Excuse me. R?za bey. How are you? I'm R?za ?enyurt. My name is Selim Ak?ay. My real profession is as a painter. I went bankrupt a short time ago. I was left with nothing at all. Everything was terrible until I discovered Jolly Life. It's been two years since I came to the Jolly Life meeting. And now I live in this house. Me and my family both use and sell Jolly Life products. And we have a jolly life! Life is beautiful if it's jolly enough. Louder! Life is beautiful if it's jolly enough. It seems to me like a good deal, Ayla. You just need to f?nd a load of staff. The more everyone earns, the more they make. It's a great system they invented. You laugh sometimes, you know. You laugh to yourself. This pock-face got up and said he'd been out of work. He said he got into Jolly Life a couple of years back. Then he showed a photo of the villa he lives in now. The man, his dog.. He's not the type to have a dog normally. But when he got the villa he got the dog too. R?za, you were just like this when you opened the restaurant too. Where does that come into it now? Look, give me the gold that's left and if I don't double it in two years... ...you can call me a loser. I need it right away today. I'm buying stuff tomorrow, you see. Shall I get it? As you like. You're a darling. A real darling, you know? You'll see. In two years. Check your watch. In two years. Oh, sweet rose, My hand is broken, My heart is at odds... Hello? Hello, it's Birg?l ?nce. From Jolly Life. R?za Bey? Yes, hello? How can I help, Birg?l Hanim? Are you ready? I'm ready! But hey, how about asking what you're ready for, huh? You'll both be a salesman yourself and f?nd staff to sell on your behalf. You'll be a salesman and team leader. You'll be boss and worker both at once. No one is tied to anyone, but everyone is tied to everyone else. Let's say the day comes when your staff numbers reach 30, 40, 50, 100. Then you're just the boss, R?za Bey. When? In two years! Maybe sooner if you work well. Show what you're made of, believe in your potential... ...and see your dreams come true, R?za ?enyurt. You deserve a far jollier life, R?za Bey. Far jollier. Just sign on the dotted line. Here we go then. In the name of God. Everyone gives you half their earnings, right? Right and I give half my earnings to the guy above me. And the guy above me gives half his earnings to the guy above him. The guy below me gives me half his earnings and keeps half for himself. I keep half of the half I get from him for myself... ...and give half to the guy above me. It goes on like that. I tell you, it's all a bit confusing to me. It's not confusing, Duran Abi. The f?rst payment comes from you. You buy stuff from the f?rm, the bag. From then on its f?fty-f?fty. The products are great. It's healthy, organic stuff. Look, go for it, Duran Abi, while you have the chance. Or later you'll only regret not being as jolly as everyone else! Look, I don't want you suffering. I'm just telling you. It's up to you. OK, where do we f?nd sales staff, Abi? Well, I found them in the teahouse. You'll f?nd them somewhere. Get it into your heads. Everyone can do this job. Just believe in your potential, believe in yourself. Don't waste your lives playing Okey. Jolly Life has a list. You sell from that list. You keep half for yourself and give half to who? - The guy above you. - You give it to the guy above you. The guy below you does some sales. Gives half of it to the guy above him. Who's the guy above him? You. Who's the guy above you? Me. Half of 5 lira is 2.5. Who do I give the 2.5 lira to? - To the guy above you. - Who does he give 1.25 to? - The guy above him. - And so it goes on. In just two years the guy bought that villa. I saw the picture he had. I couldn't believe my eyes. In a nutshell, Aytekin and G?ltekin, Duran Hodja... ...plus Yadigar, an ex-car thief, became my f?rst salesmen. Hello there. Good day to you. Can I take two minutes of your time? I'm promoting a new product. A beauty product. Skincare, hand cream. - No one buys the stuff. - We're getting late. Remind people who you are. Take orders. Good luck then. Where are you talking about? The Ministry of Health has banned the sale and import... ...of certain substances widely used in cosmetic products. Floroban tops the list of banned substances cited... ...in a statement from the General Directorate of Pharmacy. It is warned that the said substance could have carcinogenic effects. People with allergies, pregnant women, and those at risk from hypertension... ...are warned against the substance. All products containing Floroban will be recalled from the market. So R?za Abi, what's this merry life about? Jolly life. Well, jolly life then. What's it about? Poison, Lokman. Come on, Ayla. What are you mad about? I asked my brother-in-law something. I was going to tell him. There's no money in that business. It was a fantastic product. How come I didn't see it? I went under the same time as the stuff was banned. Let's look into it then. But, Mr Lawyer. I also want to ask about the fee thing. How much is it? - We have a scale of charges. - Really? - Look at trial court cases. - What? Turn to trial court cases. Can you see trial court cases there? It says 4400 lira. But that's a lot. I don't have that much. It doesn't matter. I don't either. No one's paid me what it says there on a single case yet. Pay half, that'll do. I'll do it for S?rr?. Thank you. Half then. - Yes? - Yusuf Lokman Bal. Is he here? He's in the bathroom right now. Why are you asking? We're friends of his. Lokman! Your friends are here. What friends, Ayla? How do I know? Have a look. Hello. Come here, rapist! What are you doing? Hohoho! What's going on here? Ahmet, they're beating up Lokman! Come here for God's sake. - Hey, what's going on? - This guy raped our sister. He raped our sister. What? Really? You raped her? - Would I do that, Ahmet? - Son of a bitch! Bastard! Ahmet, don't! Is that why I brought you here from the village? So you could go about raping women? Press down with this. Did you really rape the girl, Lokman? R?za Abi, rape is such a horrible word. Don't lie or I'll beat you too. Tell your brother-in-law. The other day, you know that derelict house up the top? I was sitting there with ?ermin and, sorry, but she kissed my ear. She kissed your ear? Aha. When she kissed my ear I felt all tingly inside. So I thought I'd just pull up her skirt. Lokman! What were you doing pulling up the girl's skirt? But she kissed my ear, Ayla. So at the end of the day, you... I'm afraid so. Now we've had it! Well, so he raped her. Who were those guys then? Her older brother and her other older brother. He ate half the honey that day, the animal. So the honey works. Yes, sure. Right. It works wonders. No, when I say it works... Sweetie, don't tell me you're all hung up about honey now. Have you lost your mind? I haven't lost my mind, R?za. I want children. And honey's going to do that for you, is it? Well, maybe. R?za, suppose we go and see another doctor? I'm not seeing any more doctors. Keep me out of this. Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year! Happy new year to you all! Happy new year! Happy new year! Goodbye. - hat do you want, Lokman? - R?za, where are you? At work. R?za, we're at ?stinye Park. Where's the toy shop? I'm not at the store right now. They sent me off somewhere. Go over by the restaurants. Where, R?za? You little shit, Lokman! Just go to the restaurants. I'll f?nd you there. OK. Serkan Bey, I've got a visitor coming. Can I go for lunch half an hour early? No. Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year! Oh, God. Hey, baby! The toyshop's here. Look, you see Santa Claus? Look at Santa! You won't even smile at Santa, baby! Look, it's OK. I'll handle it. Let me treat you to something, baby. Selam aleykum! Aleykum selam. Where were you? You didn't answer the phone either. We have to take toys outside the mall sometimes. I have a job to do here. - What are you doing here. - I'll introduce you. ?ermin. Right. Welcome, ?ermin. Thanks, Abi. Show him. R?za Abi, it's Lokman's idea but.. Show him, ?ermin. R?za is a gem. Don't be embarrassed. Show him. What's she going to show me? Here, R?za. Open it up. What is it? A pregnancy thing. What? Two lines means you're pregnant, R?za Abi. So? Look. There's two lines. Lokman, please don't tell him. Don't cry, baby. It's all part of the plan. If we don't do something now it'll be way too late. What plan is that, huh? R?za Abi, they won't let us get married any other way. I thought about eloping but that's a no-no. It's crucial we have a wedding and get some money together, right? So when did you get to do this? You only raped her the other day. Oh, sorry. We've been doing it for ages. You've been doing it for ages? Sure. We've had this thing for a month and a half. Whoa! A month and a half? R?za Abi, I did it so they'd have to let me marry her. They'll kill me, if you don't help. They'll either let me marry her or kill me. It's reached that point. Take that away. Filthy thing. What's it doing on the table? Hey girl, was his the only ear you found to kiss in all of Istanbul? Ear? What ear, Abi? - You kissed his ear. - No, I didn't, Abi. You did, baby. What do you mean you didn't? OK, cut it out. It's OK, I get the picture. Lokman, when did you turn into such a maniac? Look, her mum cornered her. She realized we were doing it. That's why the guys beat me up. If ?ermin hadn't got scared everything would have been f?ne. - What are we going to do, R?za? - How do I know? - Selam aleykum. - Aleykum selam. Is Ahmet Abi at home? Yes. Come in. Come in, Ayla. Shut the door, R?za. OK. - How are you, children? - Fine, thanks. - I've f?nished your skirt, Yenge. - Oh, thanks, Ayla dear. But I don't know if it's that fantastic. It is, it is. Look, these elephants are lovely. - They're rabbits, Yenge. - Here we go then. - How much do I owe you, Ayla? - Selam aleykum, Ahmet Abi. You must be joking. My brother. He looks well. Mashallah! - Mashallah! You weren't at Friday prayers again. Ahmet, if it's OK with you, we want to discuss something. The business of Yusuf Lokman. What about it, Ayla Han?m? It was your idea to bring that son of a bitch to Istanbul. I wish I hadn't gone along with it. R?za, it's better if you explain the rest. Ahmet Abi, as you know, Lokman is an ignorant boy. But what can you do? He's a brother of ours. He's been seeing a girl. I guess he told you too. They came to see me the other day. R?za, they said, it's like this. I mean, in a word, he's got the girl pregnant. Get out, Ayla Han?m! I have no family in this neighbourhood! It's over! Don't ever come here again for that son of a bitch. Enough! That's it! For God's sake. For the love of God! You don't have to push us around. You'd expect one real man in the family, damn it! I wish I'd charged her for that skirt. It took me nine days. You heard, huh? She called those big rabbits elephants. What happened? "Forget this neighbourhood," he said. "My brother deserves a wedding at the Hilton." - He said he'd pay for everything. - He congratulated you too. "He didn't just rape the girl, he got her pregnant too," he said. He's proud of you. He beat his chest like this. Was it really bad what he did? The guy shoved us out! We're f?nished too, thanks to you. I won't be surprised if he asks for rent tomorrow. Why didn't you go to Friday prayers, R?za? What's that got to do with it? That's why he has this thing against us. Because you don't go. So it wasn't because of the honey. What? Well, they've been doing it the whole time. So? That means there's no telling if it works or not. Good night, Ayla. Turn out the light. Ayla? If we had a child one day... ...look at the uncles he'd have. Mashallah, huh? I thought you were going to sleep.. - Lokman! - What's up, R?za Abi? Why haven't you turned out that light? OK, OK. He always leaves it on. He's a decent guy, I tell you. I said I had no money. - He said, "No problem. Neither do I." - You mean he's not charging you? No. But he only wants half. - How much is half? - A lot. If you have nothing, the full amount is a lot, so is half. So you see, I'm working for the lawyer. But the pasta's good, huh? Thanks. Enjoy it, Abi. - Next time I'll treat you. - You don't have to. Ahmet, add this to the bill too. OK, R?za Abi. - Take care. - Goodbye. Well, enjoy that, R?za. Thanks, Abi. - Did you put water in this? - Yes, to stop it going dry. Look, how many times do I have to tell you? It doesn't need water. It cooks in its own juices. Cook it yourself then, Mr Chef. For goodness sake! R?za Abi, I didn't leave the house once today. Bravo! Help your sister then seeing you've become a housewife. Make jewellery. You eat four eggs in one go. Cut the jokes, R?za Abi. We need to ask for the girl's hand or those guys will do me in. We'd get used to you not being around. What kind of talk is that? OK, Lokman. OK. We'll say we want our rapist boy to marry your girl and it'll be done. You're the only elders I have left. Can't you understand that for once? OK, Lokman. Eat your dinner. Eat a lot and stick it on credit. Ayla, it's really good. Enjoy it, sweetie. You want some more pilau? But stop to breathe now and again. Or you'll suffocate, God forbid. There are plenty of companies doing this business by the book. So you mean I landed a dud one of those too? Look, you sold people things but you have nothing to show it. What does that mean? You collected money from people. Well, you can't do that. What are we going to do then? People are pressing charges. If they don't withdraw those charges we may not be able to resolve it. We can't resolve it? But don't worry. I'm a lawyer. If I can't do that, I'll spin it out. What does that mean, if he can't resolve it, he'll spin it out? I don't know. He did say don't worry about it though. But I like the guy. He's decent. I reckon he'll sort this thing out. But he said he couldn't. He didn't say that. He said it was tough, it would drag on.. Come on, aren't we going inside? No. I'm not going near those guys. Look, we're soaked to the skin. Go on, get in there. Enjoy your tea. Welcome. Thanks. I've just been to my lawyer, Duran Abi. We do that sometimes too. Really? So you going, me going, does that make you happy? When you sued the company, we automatically sued you, R?za Abi. When did you learn to sue, Aytekin? Hasn't it dawned on you it might not be my fault? Wasn't it you who kept talking up Jolly Life to us? The guy talked it up to me too. For God's sake, I'm to blame now! It was him who talked about two years. He showed off the villa. He said this, he said that. And I shouldn't say this but... ...I sold my wife's gold to get into this business. S?rr?, is this man always going to bang on like this? "This man"? Is that what things have come to, Duran Abi? Why are you doing this with me? S?rr?, put it on my tab. Duran Hodja, it's still early. Duran Abi! For goodness sake come back and let's talk like human beings. Aytekin, G?ltekin, bring him back! Just look at them! Look at Aytekin and G?ltekin. R?za. Cheers, S?rr? Abi. I haven't found my place, you know. They just don't leave me alone. There isn't one person I can trust in this neighbourhood apart from you. At the f?rst opportunity they stab you in the back. Who? Not strangers. Your friends, your neighbours. And now the girl's gold has gone too. Gone to waste. Why? It's the payoff for always starting out with the wrong people. You've drunk enough, R?za. Come on now, we're closing. Look at Duran Abi. Look at that kid Aytekin. He's suing me, can you believe it! The guy talked about a jolly life. He talked about villas. "Do you want a villa?" he said. Do you say no to someone who asks if you want a villa? How could you? Then the government goes and bans the stuff. Well, what am I supposed to do now? S?rr? Abi, what am I supposed to do now? Go home. Shall I sing you a song, huh? Shall I sing you a real song? Huh, K?ksal Abi? Go on. We graze the goats by the towering mountain... Don't cry, my love, this is your destiny... If you have no one but your mother and father... Only uncaring, disloyal people Isn't that enough... Have you been drinking? Why have you started again, R?za? "Why have you started again, R?za?" Everything gets solved when you drink, doesn't it? You drink when it doesn't. Just look at Aytekin! He's suing me. When did you learn to sue? Scumbag! Damn it! Why didn't you wake me up? I'm not talking to you. How can I wake up someone I'm not talking to? Besides, I did wake you up, but you went back to sleep again. Hello. Look, I overslept. Is Serkan Bey here yet? No, R?za Abi. Hurry. Take it easy, you too. Ho-ho-ho! Happy new year! Happy new year, everyone! - Take it easy there. - Thanks, Serkan Bey. Happy new year! Ho-ho-ho! Over there, kids. Let me take a photo of you and Santa. Here we go then. Hey, what are you doing? What do you want with my beard? You little scumbags! What way is that to speak, mister? Look, I'm sorry. I'll go ho-ho-ho and make it better. Let's make peace, huh? You stink of alcohol! Excuse me, who's in charge here? I am. How can I help? What's that disgrace at the door, mister? The man stinks of alcohol. He also swore at my child. I mean, what more? Why are you laughing? It's the f?rst time in my life I've seen a drunk Santa. Sorry.. I hadn't touched it for three years, you know? I'd given it up. You see, it makes me a bad person. There, I swore at the kid. It's true. Is that any way for Santa to behave? But when he tugged off my beard just like that.. The hooligan.. Goodbye. Give me your blessing. - Sure, you have it. - Goodbye, R?za Abi.
