[MUSIC PLAYING] [FANFARE MUSIC] [THEME MUSIC] [MEN GRUNTING] That is enough! What is the meaning of this? Who is responsible? Master. Master, your order was to kill Mr. Kwan. And these two refused to do so. Forgive us, Master, for disobeying you. But Mr. Kwan is a good man. He does not deserve to die. He... Shut up! You disobeyed my orders. And for that, you will be punished. I beg you to reconsider, Master, for it is not our intention to kill innocent people. Aah, perhaps you're thinking of quitting our organization, huh? Under the circumstances, yes, sir. No, I will deal with it. The only way you leave this organization is by death. Master? I shall fight you unarmed and blindfolded. Cover my eyes. Hai! [MEN GRUNTING] Ugh! Ooh! [GROANS] Go, quick! Take care of my son. - What about you? - Do as I say! Don't argue. Go! [GRUNTS] Aah! Aah! Aie! [GROANS] My son, my son. The Manta School has two branches... the North and the South. The North Branch has three divisions... the Plum, the Bold, and the Cherry. We are of the third division. To begin, we shall exercise each day for one hour. Very well, we shall start with the basic steps. [GRUNTS] Take one big step. One, two, three, four, five. [GRUNTS] My compliments to each of you. You may rest now. Hey, you up there! What do you think you're doing? I was learning. You're what? If you wish to learn, you must pay for it. But I don't have anything to pay you with. Well, then, go home and get some money from your dad. He doesn't have any either. If you cannot pay, then you cannot take lessons. Can't I even watch? That's not like taking real lessons. Oh, it's not, eh? Well, it is as far as I'm concerned. Just watching? That's wrong? You pay or go away. Yeah, but that isn't right. Don't you tell me what's right, kid. It doesn't matter. I don't need you. I'll go find somebody else who's willing to teach me for nothing. Jackie! [GRUNTS] Hi, sis. Jackie, Papa has warned you never to fight nor watch others who fight. Well, he's wrong. I want to learn how to fight. And I want to learn how to fight well, even if I have to teach myself! Jackie. Jackie! Where are you going? Well, well. Hi there, little fellow. Hey, wait a second. Where are you going? That's no way to treat a friend. What's your name? If you got to know, it's Jackie. [LAUGHS] Is that so? Well, Jackie, how come you're walking around here, looking so low? Because I want to learn how to do the martial arts! Well, now, could be I could help you. Oh, do you know a good teacher? Do I? Me. [CHUCKLES] Are you kidding? Hah, the only thing you could teach is begging. Nah, that's where you're wrong, my boy. As a teacher of the martial arts, I am the greatest in the land. This is a chieftain's cane. It's magical. Ha! You don't know anything about the martial arts. You're just playing. [LAUGHS] Playing, am I? You must have already had some lessons, Jackie. Why don't you show me what you know? [CHUCKLES] OK. You asked for it. I'll show you what it's all about. You just watch, and you might learn something. Hm, humph. [CHUCKLES] Hm! Hm! Aah! Ow. [LAUGHS] That's very good, especially the finale. It's not fair. The grass was wet. That's what it is. If it was dry, then I wouldn't have fallen. [LAUGHS] It wasn't the grass. Your balance was incorrect. That's why you fell, son. [CHUCKLES] Humph. You better stop laughing before I get mad. If you don't quit it, I'll hit you. [GUFFAWS] You know, I like you, boy. You got a lot of spirit. And that's something that's very important. I could teach you many things in the martial arts. I liked it that you were going to hit me. [GUFFAWS] I warned you, mister. Now, you've had it! [GRUNTS] Ugh! [LAUGHS] What do you think now, Jackie? Teach me. Very well. We'll start your lessons tonight in the woods. It shall be a secret between us, the two of us. Ha-ha! I'm ready, Master. Good. [CHUCKLES] We'll begin by placing you in this bag. It is filled with magical powers. First, you must remove all your clothes. Hah. But I'll be cold. You are not to question my orders. Get out of those clothes. OK. Don't take all night. Here, I'm ready. Remove your pants, too. Do I have to? Do as I say. I'm ready, sir. Very well. Climb into this sack. Snakes! I'm not going to get into that sack. You're crazy! Come down from there. They won't hurt you. They will! They will! No, they won't. Here, cover you up. Concentrate on relaxing. Concentrate! Get me out! The martial arts are based on concentration. You must ignore your surroundings, Jackie. Concentrate. You must concentrate! For you, those snakes do not exist. They wouldn't scare you. They do not exist. But I... They don't exist! [BUZZING] [LAUGHS] Yes, one can see quite clearly with closed eyes. [CHUCKLES] Hm. Aah. Here, he-he, here, catch! Come here. [CHUCKLES] Oh, wow. Hm, mm, mm! That was quite a demonstration. Really. But how did you know it was me, Teacher? You had a handkerchief over your eyes. Because when you are blind, you have extrasensory powers. Does that make sense? Yes, it does, Teacher. Is that what you're going to teach me now? Yes. And now, you are to strike what you shall hear. Uhm. [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] To eat the chicken, first you must catch it with your teeth. Teacher, my muscles are getting real tired. Oh. [CHUCKLES] Don't worry, we'll fix that. Raw egg is just the thing. [CHUCKLES] There. Don't break it. [CHUCKLES] Teacher, what will happen if I break it? If you break the egg, you'll get nothing to eat. And I'll eat the chicken. No, don't. Don't eat my chicken, please. I promise I won't break the egg. [CHUCKLES] Very well. Teacher, may I sit down? You're tired, eh? Well, now, let's see what we have here. There. [CHUCKLES] Sit. Go ahead. It is hot! [GRUNTS] There. It is a great exercise for endurance. That is the thing you must learn. The egg. What about the egg? It's broken. Let me see. Hm. [LAUGHS] You hatched it. [LAUGHS] Hey! The fire is out! [GRUNTS] You sat on it, and put it out. [CHUCKLES] I was hungry. That's why I did it. [GRUNTS] Food is not our aim. What you must learn is to endure. That, Jackie, is our goal. Oh, yeah, Teacher? Well, my goal was defeat the chicken. [LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Tiger! Teng! Wang! Peng! But you're blindfolded! How do you know who they are? Ha! That's my secret! [GRUNTS] Hai! Hut! Hup! That is good. Thank you, Teacher. But I'm a bit sore. Yes, I know. You will soon have no sores. In time, you will endure all. I certainly learned many things studying with you. You have indeed. And before long, I dare say, you shall know as much as I. [LAUGHS] Thank you for all you've done. Done? We have only begun. Your skills must be kept a secret. You're to reveal them only if you're forced to. And another thing, if you ever need me for anything, you can always find me in the forest. There's one thing you've forgotten. Tell me, what's your name? Why, this is "The Man Who Isn't There." "The Man Who Isn't There"? But it doesn't make sense to me. [CHUCKLES] Of course, it doesn't. I'm called that because I possess certain skills where sometimes I have to use the tricks my father's father taught to his son, and he to me. [LAUGHS] I don't understand. Nor did I when I was your age. Enough of that. Go practice your somersaults. Go! Keep your leg like elastic. That's it! Keep going! Throw yourself into it, Jackie, as if you were flying! Ah! Keep those legs high up in the air! That's it! Now, punch with your elbow! Now, spread your wings and try to fly. Oh, no! [HUMS] You should try to fly like a bald eagle. Each movement a deadly strike! [LAUGHS] Oh, good morning, sis. Always practicing. Humph. You know about it, huh? But I've always known. Oh-ho! [GIGGLES] You want to try to me out, huh? Sure, why not? Ah! Oh, Jackie, Jackie! Are you all right? I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Where does it hurt? Here? Let me see. Pull up your... aah! Oh. Come on, sis. [GRUNTS] Hm. Mm. Ha! [HUMS] Hm. Ow! That's not fair. You used the pin. Well, now, isn't that too bad? You were asking for it. Aah, hm, ooh. So am I forgiven, hm? Yes, Jackie, I forgive you. Want to hold this? I'd like your help. Mm-hm. Ah! Haah! Well? What do you think? Yeah, that's very good. That's nothing. Wait till you see when I spread my claws. [GIGGLES] Hi, Dad. Hello, Dad. Humph. Studying the martial arts. Watch where you're going there! Gee, sorry. (WHISPERS) Sucker. One sweet and sour and rice and chow mein salad and one tea! Another sweet and sour. Another sweet and sour! Got that? Yeah, hey, don't start trouble, OK? It's too early. Nah, give me chicken and rice, huh? OK. Eh... no more credit in here. You know that. Yeah, quit your squawking. I got dough. I'm going to pay my bill. Here, look, see? Yeah. One order chicken and rice! Eh, make that two orders, eh? Make that two orders! MAN: Waiter! Ah. Check, please. That's $2. Here you are. Ah, thank you, sir. $2.10. Big tipper! That's $2 without a $0.10. [CHUCKLES] How well you're eating. Yeah. You see, the restaurant lets me have credit. I can pay later. Mm-hm. Is that right? Huh, yeah. Let's have your take. Come on, stop stalling. Give it here. That's all I got. You were going to spend our dough, huh? Say, listen. Hey, listen, boss. For the food, leave me something, huh? Hm, OK. You were holding out. [MEN LAUGHING] Just wait till the head man hears you were holding out. He'll do worse than that. [MEN GUFFAW] Disappear! You haven't eaten. What's the matter? Isn't the food any good? No, it isn't that. You see, the dough I had is gone. Then you can't pay, huh? MAN: Waiter! Yes, sir. What can I get you? We want the best you got. And give us plenty of it. MAN: Don't just stand there. You heard the order. Uh, I could serve it in our best dishes. Sure, why not, brother? Your best dishes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Let's have the works three times! In our best dishes! Uh, Jackie, would you come here? What's the matter? You know where our best dishes are, right? They're over at your aunt's house. Go bring them in here, eh? Sure. Give them something to eat in the meantime. Uh. Here you are, gentlemen. Dig in and eat. Those guys, I know them. They're troublemakers. [CHUCKLES] This food is lousy. [GRUNTS] Hey, there! Hey! Excuse me, gentlemen. You haven't paid. We didn't eat. $5, please. It is a mistake. I must apologize. You all right? They did it, these three! Tear this place apart. Yeah. [MEN GRUNTING] Whoa! Whoa! Hai! Yah! [GRUNTS] Hurray! You are really super! Only, uhh, ah! You murdered all three of those bums, he-he. Hey, wait. Let them go. I want to talk to you. Come on! Good. He has enemies now. Let's see where it leads. (ANGRILY) Who is it? Uh, a waiter. A waiter? You mean, a waiter beat all three of you up? Uh, well, yeah. He was good. Was he now? An insignificant waiter. He made absolute fools of you of three! (SHOUTS) Do I have to do everything myself? No, uh, we didn't collect the loot. That's all he had. It is, huh? Did you check his house? Or you want me to do that? Now, listen. Yes, sir. I'm listening. Hm. That pickpocket needs to be taught a lesson. And while you're at it, take care of that waiter. Yes, sir. Let's go. You were fighting. Hey, look, they were beating up uncle. You know the rules in this house. No fighting. It is not allowed. But you choose to ignore that! Not deliberately. I wasn't thinking about it, I guess. Hm. And you know what the rules are for disobedience. Yes, Father. I am to be punished. That's right. You will fetch 30 buckets of water from the well. You knew Dad would catch you sooner or later. Yeah. That is the way that breaks go. Hey, I'll bet you're hungry. Dad isn't around. I'll make you something to eat. Thanks, sis. I'll eat after I finish my work. Then I'll be hungry enough to eat anything. Stubborn ox. Hey, wait a minute! Got you, you thief! That's my purse in your hand. Let me go! Please, heh, let go of my hand before I whack you! Who do you think you are? You stole my purse, you thief. Take that, that, and that! That's what we do to thieves! Aargh! Aah! That's what we do to wise guys! I... I'll get you for that! Huh, uh! Oh, it's you. Say, you know what? We could do us great things together, huh? Oh, yeah? Like what, for instance? Hey, come here. Look, the first thing we got to do is you teach me how to fight, and I'll teach you how to steal. Is that your deal? Yeah. Well, thanks. But no thanks. What a fighter, though. Huh! Whoa. Whoa! Oh! [GROANS] PICKPOCKET: Grandma, I'm sorry. I'll take this for all the trouble you've caused me this morning. Oh! You leave my boy alone, do you hear? Quiet! You're pretty tough, aren't you? [GROANS] Grandma, are you all right? Ugh! [MEN GRUNTING] Oh! Aah! Hah! Grandma? [MEN GRUNTING] Whoa! Heyah! [MEN GRUNTING] That's for getting beaten up again. You're useless, all three of you! Absolutely useless! Well, who was it this time? Ha? It was that waiter again. Was who? One lousy waiter. I wanted him taken care of! Can't you even do that right? He's pretty tough. Stop your whining. That waiter needs to be taught a lesson. I want him beaten up! Yes, sir. BIG BOSS: And no excuses this time! Humph! Either one of you got an idea? So fighting again! This is a house of peace not of violence. Can't you get that through your head? You want to destroy life. Here! They've got life, too. Flowers, destroy them if you must. Uh! Uh! Hah! Damn you! Just the man I want to see. Tea for eight people, 48th Street. They want it delivered. [GRUNTS] Eh? [CHUCKLES] 48th Street? Eight orders of hot tea. Right away! Thank you. Hey, just a second! I just ordered some tea. But if I were you, I wouldn't deliver it, get me? Really? Why not? Because they're waiting. Those fellows that you smashed are out there. [CHUCKLES] Thanks. Yeah. Everything all set? Is he coming? Uh-huh. He's on his way. Good. Take your position. I want that waiter taught a lesson he'll never forget. Go on! You, too. Get ready! He's on his way! Your tea is here! MAN: Bring it in! Wait a second. I don't wish to fight. You want to get even, OK? You may hit me all you want. Don't worry. I won't hit back. Why, you scared? Think what you like. You asked for it. [GRUNTS] Oh! [THUDS] Hrrh! [GROANS] Ugh, how can he let them beat him like that? Uh, what do you want? Sorry. Huh? Your brother, Jackie. He's in trouble. He needs help. Jackie? Come on! Hurry! There he is, see? Oh! Uhh! [SNICKERS] Well, look what we got here. Yeah. Hey, cutie, how about giving us a little kiss, eh? [MEN LAUGHING] Leave her alone. Well, now, looky here. You're going to make us, huh? Just let her go. She has nothing to do with this. Nothing! Your quarrel is with me, not her. Hah! Don't you worry, your time will come. First, let's see what this pretty lady looks like underneath, huh? You better leave her alone. I'm warning you. Huh, look at me. I'm frightened. Hey, honey, let's see what you really look like, huh? [GASP] Hey, hey! Go on, heh! [GRUNTS] Hah! [GRUNTS] Heyah! Hai! [MEN GRUNTING] Aah! [GROANS] Aah! Why, Teacher? Why are you beating me? Stupid fool! Letting those worthless scum hit you. How dare you? How dare you? After all I've taught you! Aah! Aah. I was only following my father's wishes. He forbids me to fight. Aah, he does, does he? [LAUGHS] Now, let's see how you feel about it. You've learned to fight, then you will fight! It's what you've been taught and taught well. So you will fight! You understand? All right. All right. I won't do it again. What won't you do again? Let others beat me up. You promise that on your word of honor? I do. I do. I promise. Just so you won't forget! [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] You understand? What is it you want from me? You are a fighter. And you will fight. You must! It's in your blood now, Jackie, as in mine. I will obey. Fighting again. You just won't listen. I'm sorry, Dad. This time your punishment will be severe. You are to stick your fist into broken glass. Go on. I said go on! Ugh! Aah! Oh, how cruel! I will have to mend that hand. Uhh, uhh, uhh. FATHER: Now, go. You heard me. Go! So what he has broken, I shall mend. [GRUNTS] Huh. Uhh. The pain will go away. Yes, Teacher. You are very fortunate that I know which herbs to use in order to mend your hand. Be thankful for that. I am, Teacher. I am. It itches. It itches, heh? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] That is good. Very good. That means it's healing. When we're finished, Jackie, your fingers will be twice as strong as they ever were. You shall see. Come here now, and let me bind that hand. Ah, oh, sure, Dad. I brought your tea. Thank you, son. That was very kind. How's your hand? Oh, it's all right. Uh, what are you doing? Uh, uh, I don't... well, I use it when I work. We shall let the clown handle it. Now, go and take care of it. Yes, Master. Hold it! Uhh, it's you. He-he. Well, well. You're a bit late. I know that. Right now, things aren't going too good. Hm. Too bad. You owe us for quite a few weeks, friend. Now, pay! I intend to. It's only that business has fallen off lately. And I'm rather a bit too short, you understand? No. Now, you listen closely. Tomorrow, bring the dough, or you've had it. Yes, certainly. Tomorrow, without fail. My nephew will bring it. Uncle? Hm? Here it is. I'll take it over to the landlord. Jackie, what happened to your hand? Nothing. It's all right. On second thought, I think I'd better go. No, uh, no, honest. I'll be all right. I better get going. Teacher! Teacher! Where are you? You want me to fight, and my dad doesn't. And my poor uncle's being squeezed by the syndicate. Help me, Teacher. Help me! Well, now, we shall go together, Jackie, and pay the clown. And while were at it, we'll have ourselves a little fun. What do you say, huh? [CHUCKLES] Come. You're naughty. I am, aren't I? Hm. [CHUCKLES] Oh, that, ah... mean too much. This time, right? Hm. The 9 crack. Oh, right. The 9 crack. Hm. In that case, there! A ridiculous play. [GRUNTS] Oh, no. I'll take that. It's my option. Feel lucky today, eh? Unfortunately, I'm luckier. [GRUNTS] I am lucky, aren't I? [GIGGLES] Of course. Ask the other girls. [CHUCKLES] The master is lucky. Very lucky. Very, very lucky. And how. Hm, the others seem to agree. Well, why not? You are lucky. [GIGGLES] Oh. [CHUCKLES] Hm. [CHUCKLES] Hm, hm, mm, mm! [CHUCKLES] See? The master wins again. Now, pay up, gentlemen. [MEN LAUGHING] Who are you? JACKIE: My name is Jackie. My uncle sent me here with the rent. Ah! A little later, it would have been too late. Where is it? Here. Very funny. $0.20? That is an insult. What do you take me for? A beggar like him? JACKIE: He is my teacher, and a better man than you. I do not like your attitude. You are being disrespectful. I think you need to be taught a lesson. [GRUNTS] Oh? You're surrendering before the fight even starts. [GUFFAWS] Wait, old man. You ain't seen nothing yet. Why, he could take three of you and beat you all. Humph! Look at that style. That's class. Quite right. Humph! JACKIE: I'll take care of him. No, I'll take care of it. You go on back home. I'll see you later. Go on, now. JACKIE: Yes, sir. Hup! You'll take care of it, huh? I hope for your sake that you can. How much money do you have on you? Huh, huh, huh? Uh, in gold? [LAUGHS] You see, I only travel with gold. It's a bit more, uh, convenient to use nowadays. Right? [GUFFAWS] Eh, tell me, do you gamble? OLD MASTER: A bit. Set up the table. Yes, sir. Sit down. Humph. Ready, sir. Please. Hm, mm, mm. Humph. Hrm. Oh. Hm. [GRUNTS] Just one hand, all right? What are the stakes? Should I lose, the restaurant debt is paid. Now, should you lose, you'll work for me for three long months. It's a deal. Shall we start? Humph. Split the tiles. Doubles. [CHUCKLES] Looks strong, ha-ha! Well, I'm waiting. Well? What have you got? Besides a flea, ha-ha-ha. [GRUNTS] Oh, I really hate to do this to you, but that's the way the tiles go. Hm. [GASP] My god, it's a classic! Yes, my friend. It certainly is. A rare classic. And it wins. Hm. Very good. Now, for the big test of strength. Unless, of course, you're scared. Oh, me? Frightened of you? It'll be a pleasure to fight you, you clown. Enough! Now, get this lousy table out of here! You heard me? Get it out of here! [SNICKERS] You look like a frightened hen. [CLUCKS] Hm, hrm, hm, mm, mm. I intend to thrash you using the style of the hawk. Krrr. Eh, you're going to fight or just play around? Hm, who is playing around? I'm going to beat your head in. [GRUNTS] You hit me while my back was turned. Yaah! Ohh, aw, cool it! OLD MASTER: [LAUGHS] Gaah! Gaah, gaah. [SOBS] What are you doing now? Praying for salvation? Humph. It won't do you any good. Get up, you clown. I'll fix you! I'm waiting. Come on. Arrh. [LAUGHS] What a bum you are, clown. Now, try it on for size. [LAUGHS] Now, you've gone too far. Yah! [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] When you smoke, you use the other end. I will take care of him. Huh! One, two, hup! Oh! [GRUNTS] Haah! [GRUNTS] Your tummy needs a little decoration, huh? [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] Brand me, will you? Ugh! [LAUGHS] You're nothing but a fat tub of lard. [MEN GRUNTING] That spinach is good. Now, it's time for my Popeye Special. Get out of the way, Fats. I don't want you to get hurt. [MUSIC - "POPEYE THE SAILOR MAN"] Ohh-wah! Yah! Hah! Ducking won't do you any good. Yah! Ugh! [GROANS] Kitchy, kitchy, koo! [CHUCKLES] Where are you going? [GASPING] I'll fix you. You will fix no one. [LAUGHS] Come on, give me a break. Get off me, will you? Hm. I'll give you a break. [LAUGHS] Fooled you! Got you that time! The graceful movements of the crane will fix your wagon. Oh, I rather like the old conga line. You know... [SINGING] tada, dada, boom, boom. Your time has come. I was only playing with you before. But now... Alley-oop! [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] [SINGING] Tada, dada, boom, boom. I got my mojo going. Yah! Hah! [LAUGHS] Aah! You rotten, dirty... Now, I'll show you! Caught you! Ha-ha-ha! That is a very dangerous area. [FARTS] Haah. Hooh. [WHIMPERS] And while you're at it, don't forget to cross off that little debt. [LAUGHS] [WHIMPERS] You, you, you, you... your mother wears corsets! [LAUGHS] You're right. She does! [LAUGHS] [SNORTS] Huh? Look at that. You know what? You know what he did? He filled in all holes with dandruff, that's what. That beggar. He'd done cheated me. [WHIMPERS] Hey you, there! We're hungry. Bring the food here. Uh, sorry, sir. I can't. You see, this food is already ordered. Can't you hear me? I said that we're hungry. Uh, what I can do is after I deliver this is bring you the same order. That's the waiter. Go on. And when you get through, get us some noodles. WOMAN: Help! Help me! Help! What's the matter? You should go! WOMAN: Oh, stop! [SOBS] Oh! Ugh! Oh! Let me go! Oh! (WHISPERS) Jackie. Hey, Jackie. That girl, she really needs help. Huh, ugh! [CLATTERS] Oh! Help! Uhh! Uh! Uh! Help! Help! [GASPING] Let her go! [THUDS] [GRUNTS] Come on, quick! I'll speak to you later. Wait! It's that waiter. He is back. I know it's in his blood. Who could be teaching him? If you wanted to, you could teach him. Remember? Chow Ling? Yes. Chow Ling, your old friend. "Friend," you say. That was long ago. But it's all over now. Yes, but when you were young, you were pretty wild. [SNICKERS] All right. I don't wish to discuss that era. It's dead and gone. Tell me what you want, and go! Oh, Chow Bin is the father of Jackie. So what of it? Hey, you're not friendly at all. Just wanted to make sure. He is not of your clan. His father was. That's true. But why do you... Wait a minute. Like I said, I only wanted to know. That is all. [SIGHS] So that's who he is, Chow Bin's son. CHOW LING: Yes, Master. I killed the father. Now, I must kill the son. Take care of it. [SIGHS] Poor Jackie. [MEN YELLING] Haah! Yah! Dad. Let him go. I ask you that as a favor to a friend. Go. You heard him. Yes, Father. [GASPING] And that's the last favor, pal. Father, what are we going to do now? I think it's best that we go away, so they won't get Jackie. Hm. I've got two good hands, so why should I hide? Dad, I brought you a little soup. [GASPING] Thank you. But it's no use. What are you saying? Don't talk like that. You're going to be all right. All you need is rest and nourishment. That's better. You just lay back and rest. I'm going out now. I'll be back in a while. Hey, you didn't pay last week. Cough it up. Ah! Uhh! Hey, you! [GRUNTS] [THUDS] Where are you going, huh? Oh, you're a tough guy, huh? Hey, you're new around here. Yeah, so what if I am? So you need dock insurance. "Dock insurance"? I don't need any insurance. That's what you think? Uh, hey! Get over here. I need a little help. We can't pay our insurance this week. Can we pay it next week? You're supposed to pay it every week. What you need is a little lesson. Take him. Hold it. Now, you listen. If you don't clear out of here, you won't know what hit you. So now, he's king of the dock, huh? That does it. Burn his house down. Well, don't just stand there. Do what I said! One more thing. When you're finished doing that, kill him! No! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Here's what you'll do. We'll use that pickpocket as bait for our friend Jackie Chan. Yes, Master. PICKPOCKET: No, Jackie, don't! That's what they want. They want you to fight. Go! I can't. PICKPOCKET: Go now, before it's too late! I can't. Why can't they leave me alone? Because you're too good for them. That's why. Jackie, for god's sake, go! Don't worry about me. My life is over. I was... I was never any good anyhow. Should I or shouldn't I? I told you to fight! I hear you! Ooh! Why don't you be sensible and give up? [GRUNTS] Knock their lousy teeth out. Give it to them, Jackie! You're doing just great. Hang on. What do you think I'm doing? [MEN GRUNTING] [YELLS] Uh! [YELLS] Hah. Goodbye, little friend. Rest in peace. You did it. You're responsible for his death. Let's see you take me on. Ah, you mean, just the two of us. Why not? You can add me to your list of kills. You'd like that, wouldn't you? You're not afraid of me, are you? [SNICKERS] No. You're going to die! [GRUNTS] Humph. [GRUNTS] I'll kill him! [GRUNTS] I got it! [GRUNTS] Aie! Heyah! Heyah! [GRUNTS] Jackie! Get up and fight! Yaah! Now's the time! [GASP] Uhh. Huh! [SNARLS] [PANTING] It's called "getting your kicks." Haah! [GRUNTS] Hai! Aah! [GROANS] You there, Jackie Chan. It is I who you seek to kill. You are much too tired now. We will fight at Green Valley. Let us say tomorrow... When I shall kill you. The flag! Come on. Come on! [LAUGHS] You want to win? You'll have to move a lot quicker than that. The man is a master! Ha-ha! Your flag-work is still too slow. The trident... use that! Let it fly forward to its target. Now, you're a bird. Quick, into your tree! Now, climb it. Up, up high, away in the sky. Go, move! Dig your fingers in. Make that branch your palace! Ha-ha! You'll be all right. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] I am ready for you. Let us begin. There is no need for you to fight. I will take him and kill him. Humph. [MUSIC PLAYING] And what kind of style is that? This is the fish style and very effective. [CHUCKLES] [BOTH GRUNTING] That is a fin, and you cannot hurt it. Krrrh. There you see? Ow! Aah! Agh! You hurt my leg, and you weren't supposed to! Says who? [GRUNTS] Well? Aah! [GRUNTS] Hai! Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake. Ooh. Ooh. [GRUNTS] You keep your lips in that position much longer, you're going to hurt yourself. [GRUNTS Aah! Will you cut that out? Now, get your foot off my chest. [GRUNTS] Why don't you just give up? My strongest weapons are my legs. Come out with your kicks. [GRUNTS] Now, ha-ha! I got you now! [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] Aw, finish him off. You're wasting all your energy! [BOTH GRUNTING] Ooh! You don't fight fair. Agh! Hey, Teacher! What do you think of this hunk of meat, huh? [LAUGHS] I think he kind of looks like a pork sandwich. [LAUGHS] Enough! Come here. We shall fight blindfolded if you're not afraid. Here, bind my eyes. Yes, Master. He is the one who killed your daddy. So at last, we meet. It will be a pleasure to fight you blindfolded. Jackie, you are equal! But he has experience, where you do not. You must use everything you've ever learned. I hear you, Teacher. Today, you will die! Hai! [MUSIC PLAYING] Aah! Hup! Without sight, you need very special skills to fight. Those I have! [BOTH GRUNTING] The Lightning Fist. Use it! [BOTH GRUNTING] Haah! [GRUNTS] Aah! [GRUNTS] You're not so tough. Hah! Ah! Heyah! You're losing him. You must hit harder and follow through! [GRUNTS] [WHINNYING] What in the world is that? The Horse Style? Haah! [BOTH GRUNTING] Use the trident! Huh? Haah, aie! [GRUNTS] Huh? Haah, aie! [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] And when your head is down and they think they've got you, that's when you become tricky and alter your tactics. And you jump to Bear Fly Crouch... stalking, ready to spring. Aah! Hah! [GROANS] Huh? This is yours now, Jackie Chan. You have earned it. [FANFARE MUSIC]
