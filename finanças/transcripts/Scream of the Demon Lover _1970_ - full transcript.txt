SCREAM OF THE DEMON LOVER You're welcome. Thanks. If you're looking for a place to stay, here is an inn if you want. No thanks, I'm not staying in this place. - I have to leave immediately. - Alright. So I wish you a good trip. Thanks again. Another murder! One day they will burn down the castle! Hopefully it's the last time. - Once again. - So it is. Good morning. Good morning. How can I help you? I need a vehicle. I have to go to Zilhaj. - Where? - Where? To the Castle of Zilhaj. You don't know where it is? It's the residence of the Baron von Dalmar. I'm sorry, I don't have a car. I can't drive you there. Well, I'll have to go there tomorrow. No, I won't be able to drive you tomorrow either. But that seems absurd to me! My ticket is for... I'm sorry, miss, I can't. I'm going to complain to Central Office and... Good day, gentlemen. I really need to go to Zilhaj Castle. Hey, wait a minute! I can pay, look! What do you want? I will drive you there. My name is Fedor. I have a car here. It's not very comfortable, but... Shall we go? Inspector Zaak? I am the mayor. I'll introduce you to the judge, the doctor, and our chief of police. We look forward to seeing you. It happened again last night. It's the sixth time since Igor's death. The late Baron of Dalmar. We have to act fast if we want to make it happen. If you don't mind, I'd like to talk about this in a quieter place. For sure. Forgive me. If you want to follow me. Baron Igor died in the fire in his laboratory a year ago. He's said to have almost discovered a cure for dying. But I think he was insane. Anyway, one day when he was just experimenting... "boom". And he was gone. When found, it resembled... a leg of lamb left in the oven. But... I was hired by Baron Dalmar! Now Janos is the Baron. The younger brother, the devil take him. But why do you say that? - Did you see today's funeral? - Yes, but... So it was... a woman. It's said that Janos raped her and throw her to the dogs. All the women who loved him ended up like that. It can't be! Why should he have done something so outrageous? What do I know? Perhaps the Dalmars' madness is also hereditary. It's said that he was the one who set fire... to the shed where his brother was. If you think you can scare me, you're wasting your time. No! What I say is true, as true as my name is Fedor. It's true that I'm driving you to certain death. - Be quiet! - Are you scared now? Look, this is your grave. You will fall in love with him like all women... and die like everyone else. I said shut up! I order you to stop! You will die. You will die, the dogs will eat your flesh... and your blood will soak the ground. You will pay for it. That's enough! That's enough! I like girls who are brave like you! Do it to me too! Maybe you would enjoy it and I could save your life. Go to hell! - Good morning. - Good morning. I am Miss Rakowsky. Miss Rakowsky? Do you have any papers? The Olas agency sent me. I was late due to an accident. Alright, come in. - Where is your father? - My father? - Yes, Mr. Rakowsky. - A gentleman? I'm Ivanna Rakowsky. I have a contract with the agency. I was told to come here for a job. I advise you to look for another place for your services. They would be wasted here. I'll show you my contract. Take and read the terms. You'll see it doesn't specify... what type of professional it requests. - Look here! - I'm sorry, but it doesn't work here! - Go away! - Let me go! - Let me go! - I told you to go away! Go away! Enough, Olga! She didn't want to listen to me. I said we don't need women here. It's late and the weather is bad. It would be unwise to send her away. Let's be hospitable. Tomorrow go with her to the village so she can catch the stagecoach. - But... - Nonetheless... we will pay one month's salary as compensation. Since you haven't introduced yourself, I assume you are Baron Dalmar. - Yes, at your service. - I assume that's your signature. And I suppose you should honor your commitments. Pay her two months salary. I don't want money I didn't earn. I graduated from Ruhr University with best grades. You asked for a good chemist and I'm here. Believe me, it's better if you leave. If this is because of the rumors going around, don't worry. I only believe what I see and such things don't concern me. - Three months salary. - Hang on. - Did you call me? - Accompany the lady to the green room. Dinner at eight. If you need hot water, Cristiana will be there for you. This way, please. I'm not willing to allow that. I've been a housekeeper here for three years. I became your mistress. But you just neglect and betray me. I didn't stay for the money, it was to stay by your side. You can go whenever you want. I can't, Janos, and you know it. I love you. I patiently endured all your love affairs. Because I knew that one day everything would be like before. You are wrong, Olga. What was between us is over. I don't want this intruder to ruin my hope! I won't! No! No! That's enough! Don't worry about her. She will leave tomorrow. Women are too curious. You must not know anything. Cristiana! Come in. Bring me the bath towel, please. Haven't you ever seen a woman taking a bath? Naked? No! And how do you bathe? Well... naked, no. What do you think of the baron? Well, I don't know... I think he's wonderful. Are you in love with him? Good night. A penny for your thoughts. - I was watching the dogs. - Did you like them? Very. When I was a child, we had many animals at home. What are these marks? I don't know, it appears from time to time on them and on the horse. It must be some poisonous wild plant in the woods... who hurt their skin when they walk around with me. But these wounds were caused by a whip. What stupid things are you saying? I didn't say anything stupid! The dogs have been whipped! - How dare you say such a thing? - For sure! Sir, our work is over. It's already ten o'clock and we still have an hour to go home. - And my clothes? - Are in the closet. Why did you do that? Now I have to pack my suitcase again. No, the Baron was very clear. He must have changed his mind. If he thinks he can control me, he's wrong! I hope you die! Did you order my suitcase to be unpacked? Can you answer me? But why would you want... What happened to you? Aren't you feeling well? - I thought that... - I decided that you will stay. And I decided to pack my suitcase again. No, you can't go away. If you leave now... it will only show that you are afraid to stay in the castle. But if you really like chemistry and your profession, you will stay. What are you trying to say? Come with me. I'll show you something. If you really want to leave later, I'll accompany you to village myself. Although you've only been in town for a short time... you've certainly heard of the horrible end my brother met. When it happened, Igor was trying to discover the origin of life. Oh, yes. But that's absurd. Today we know that it was all a fairy tale. Miss, no scientific knowledge is limited to science. Remember that Miguel Servet was burned alive... because he claimed that blood circulated in the body? That's true. That's true, but... This direction, please. - Where are we going? - To my lab. The fundamental principle of my brother's studies... was that matter is not destroyed, only changed. Water evaporates and becomes cloud. And when the vapors condense, they fall as water down. Man feeds on the product of the earth... and extracts a series of chemical elements from it. And when they die, they fertilize the land and provide new food. If this is really true... why believe that what fire destroys is lost forever? I will only rest when I discover a formula capable of regenerating... charred matter. That's why I decided to hire you. Do you realize the complexity of this project? Even if it's possible, we are both alone... starting from scratch. Here, we'll start almost from infinity. We have four generations of study results. When we study them carefully... we will find that between theory and practice... there is only a small wall and we must tear it down. We can try. Even if it doesn't help your brother at all. Why not? This is what's left of my brother Igor. What liquid is this? Alcohol mixed with substances whose formula I will give you. But it is dead matter and its power of regeneration is null. Our work will consist of maintaining this regeneration. Come, please. We'll start the experiments as soon as possible. Today it is essential to work with a modern chemist. Science has advanced with such speed... that it is impossible for lay people to keep up. See you tomorrow. - So you decided to stay? - You already know my answer. Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. Why did you bring me here, you bastard? Coward! If you obey me, nothing will happen to you. You must obey everything I say. Remember... everything. You must... Where is she? What did you do with her? I didn't do anything, I swear! I've told you everything I know, let me go! You offered to take that girl to the castle. Yes or no? And when you arrived in the forest... - you raped and killed her! - They're all lies! I kissed her, it's true. But nothing more! But I didn't kill her, the Baron did! I tried to rape her. But I didn't kill her. Do you swear what you say is true? I swear. Do you sign that statement? I do not know how to write. It makes no difference. Give me your hand. Can I go now? No. I'm afraid not. Mr. Judge... With this statement in hand we can incriminate this scoundrel. You son of a bitch! For attempted rape, at least six months. Arrest him. I believe you are speaking the truth. In any case, Ms. Rakowsy is a guest at the castle. We don't need to worry. If that's the case, we have more reason to fear for its integrity. Gentlemen, I know you're all impressed... by the strange deaths that have occurred in this region... but you cannot accuse anyone... based solely on assumptions and superstitions... without any real proof. Superstitions? If you had seen the mutilated corpses of those girls... you would not have spoken of superstitions. These are concrete, real, terrifying facts. I've never seen anything like it. And you want to accuse Janos Dalmar of being the author? If you want to take it to court... on what basis do you want to file a complaint? We have a judge here, ask him. And he will tell you the value of your evidence in court. First: all the girls in the area were, how can I say that... In love with Baron Dalmar? Exactly. The court will take this into account, but nothing more. Second: the girls were violently attacked by something like... the fangs of an animal. The Baron has two dogs. Fierce, faithful and obedient. So what? Therefore... it would not be risky to conclude that the Baron is a sex maniac... who throws the women he rapes to his dogs. Halt! Doctor, could you say a word to this gentleman about the autopsy? Well, indeed, the poor women made love before they died. But none of them showed signs of sexual violence. Let's say there was a... "voluntary membership". Mr. Judge, if you were Janos Dalmar, what would you do... in his place if you were accused of murder based on the evidence presented? I would file a defamation suit with the authorities. And what would the penalty be? Interruption of public services... a significant amount of compensation... and, most likely, a few months of detention. Gentlemen, please be calm. If the Baron is found guilty, he will pay. But we have to prove it. I thought about paying a visit to Zilhay Castle... but I needed a reason. I had no valid reason to issue a warrant. And Miss. Rakowsky gave me that reason. Perhaps it will be right to keep Fedor under arrest... and we will go to the castle to find out about the girl. If we find her alive. It must be eleven o'clock by now. Eleven o'clock? You mustn't be a good worker by the time you get up. What did you put in the milk? - In the milk? - I'll report you to the police. In the milk? You haven't even had a drink yet. After drinking the milk... I wanted to turn off the light... but the chandelier fell. Which chandelier? If you want to report something, the time is now. There are two policemen downstairs waiting to interrogate you. They're not very hospitable around here. I told you, inspector, you only get in here with a warrant. And yet... You see? Safe and sound. Yeah, I think I'll testify. I will file a complaint. If you can calm these beasts, we have a document here. - Wait a minute, sir. - Thanks. Don't worry, gentlemen. Ms. Rakowsky can sign right here. Feel free to sign. Good morning. Get your lab coat. - Did you read the text I gave you? - I just started. I read for a few minutes and sleep started to overtake me. You need to start here and work your way up to that reaction. Take it. What did the chief of police want? Do you have something to settle with justice? What about you? They seemed a lot more interested in you than me. You must have heard the rumors that go around about me. Even though they don't have proof, they think I'm guilty... of killing those girls. And you are? I have no reason to speak of my private affairs. You're right. I had a terrible night. It's nothing unusual. I should have warned you. About what? The substance that conserves Igor's body... has a high hallucinogenic power. If you are sensitive to these reagents... start using a mask while working. That's an antidote. A few drops are enough. I could have sworn something happened to me tonight. It didn't feel like a dream. It was so absurd that... Miss, I'm paying you to solve chemical formulas. And not to tell me about your dreams and nightmares. Yes, sir. - Is the horse ready? - Here you are, Mr. Baron. What do you have? I was scared. I didn't hear you came in. Forgive me. I didn't know. I thought you were moving it and it would ruin a lot of days work. - I know my job well. - I don't question that. I mean that you have followed the program up until now. Here you have it. - I'll take a look at it tonight. - I'm at the point you mentioned. And since I have two options showed... I developed one of them further. And treated the reaction... I told you I'd take care of it tonight! We'll talk about it tomorrow. After so much hard work, miss... it would be nice if you had some fun, don't you think? At dusk the light in the forest was so impressive that... Save that conversation for another type of person. I'm just here to work. So if you could tell me what the formula is... Enough! When I give an order, I want absolute obedience. You are paid for this. We'll only talk about work tomorrow. But... Sir, the champagne. To the health of our collaborator. So that you can successfully complete your work. Sorry, but you asked me not to talk about work anymore today. Good night. Miss Rakowsky? - Who is it? - It's Baron Dalmar. Please open. - Are you very angry with me? - Did you just come for that? - Yes. - So sleep easy, Baron. No incident will interfere with our work in the laboratory. - Do you hold grudges? - Very. This is really bad. The grudge is for the harm done to me. Is it worse to do or remember? Forgive me. Shall we make peace? Don't be afraid. Your pride can't hide your nature. I like you very much, Ivanna. I ask you to go away, please. Good night. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Ivanna. What you want? Nothing. Goodnight. No... no... I'm dreaming... I'm dreaming... Sleep. Sleep peacefully. Nobody will hurt you. You are so white. White and smooth like marble. Nobody will hurt you. I will kill anyone who tries. It must always remain this way. Otherwise, my revenge will turn against you! Made friends with my beasts? They never accept affection from anyone... but with you it's different. Would you like a cup of tea? I examined the dogs wounds. And I can assure you they were whipped. Did something bother you tonight too? Yes. I'm sure you didn't wear the mask. If you don't, you'll end up seeing ghosts everywhere. My dreams are like the wounds of these dogs. - What you mean? - That's just it. We must get back to work. Check this out. It's the formula I was researching yesterday. Does it look correct? Certainly. The two solutions I envisioned would lead to this same point... but I wasn't sure. I thought you wouldn't understand the results of my research... but I was wrong. I'm going to the lab. Just a moment, Ivanna. I am delighted with your enthusiasm for the work... but the road is long and we have to see it through to the end. And I don't want you to get too tired. The Tale of the Hare and the Tortoise. Exactly. I will know how to dose my strength. I am happy. But remember that beyond the laboratory... there is also the grass, the air, the sun... and the breakfast you haven't finished yet. Janos! Janos! - Get out of there! - I just wanted to talk to you! Get out of there! I told you to get out of there! Olga, why did you allow it? Get out there or you'll regret it! What did I do? Lock it so no one will ever open it again! I am not willing to tolerate this! Never do that again! - What did I do? - Nobody can open that door! You can go wherever you like, but you must not cross it... if you fear for your life! Then you must be Bluebeard! And behind that door are all the women you've killed! Sometimes I think what they say about you is true! Calm down! If you disobey me, your life will be in danger! Neither I nor my dogs will be to blame! That whole part of the castle is in ruins! And with one false step, everything can fall apart! Olga, keep the key to that door. Curiosity is a bad advisor and Ms. Rakowsky's life... beyond being very expensive, is very necessary. Go away! Who the hell could it be at this hour? LYCANTHROPY I've prepared all the dinner. So we're done for today. We leave at half past ten. I don't want to be out at midnight. Go, go. He's already back! We were worried, sir. Take him to the stable and dry his sweat. Cristiana has already prepared dinner. - Good evening, sir. - Good night. You can go, your father is waiting. If you need anything else, I can stay a little longer. I'm not afraid to go home alone. No, thanks. Perhaps at another time. - Have the ladies left already? - No, sir. They're waiting in the hall. See you tomorrow, Christiana. What a delicious night. Riding in the moonlight is indeed a pleasure. Olga, you can leave. The reaction with ascorbic acid gave me a little trouble. I can give more details tomorrow. Good night. Just a moment. Don't play the offended goddess, be more human. If you ask me for humanity after offending me... I don't want to be human anymore. Please! I know she felt offended about earlier today. However, in life there are doors that we shouldn't open. And walls we can't get through. I'm glad to hear that. Why don't you leave me alone once and for all? What you mean? I say you don't respect what's behind those doors and walls. - I don't? - Yes, I'm being spied on. Especially when I shower or change my clothes. Are you crazy? My indignation is lessened by the pity I feel for you... - That's enough! - and the methods you resort to! I don't know if you're stupid or vain. You can't imagine how many women I've had in my arms. - All prettier than you. - I don't care about your bitches! So you'd better not waste any more time here... and go make love with the first one you come across! It's the first smart thing you've said since you got here... and I'll take it. We must leave this job. When we least imagine it, disaster will happen. Got crazy? At your age... where else would you earn what the Baron pays you? I don't know, I'll do anything. I can work on the farm. On the farm, you? What are you saying? See, with your salary and your petty thefts. Sofia! Don't want me to call things by their true name? We managed to put it all together. With a little more, we can retire to the countryside. I'm worried about Christiana. Sometimes the Baron looks at her in a way I don't like. All women prefer a real man. It might be a good opportunity to get everything together at once. Sofia! What are you saying? Have you forgotten how all the other girls ended up? Nonsense! This is just superstition! I guarantee that if Cristiana met the Baron... he would lose. You are very quick to come up with solutions. - Go to hell! - Everything is easy for you. If he comes here, I'll blow his brains out. Go see if Cristiana was listening. She is also crazy about him. DUODECIMA PARS. PLENILUNIUM Janos. What are you doing? No! No! No! No! No! Ivanna! What happened? Calm down! What happened to her? I don't know, but she was scared to death! Go to sleep and tomorrow you will tell me. Not like that, Ivana. I would never forgive myself. Now rest. Thank you. Thank you. Janos. Come. Come in. You won't regret it. Do you remember my skin? You loved it. We spent so many happy hours together. But now everything has to be the way it was. I've been waiting for you for two years, Janos. For two years. I want to see your face, Janos. Why don't you come closer? Mr. Inspector, the woman is dead. I can tell you more tomorrow after the autopsy. Thank you, doctor. We checked out the whole castle. We didn't find anything. And where does this door lead to? To the tower stairs... in the laboratory where the Baron's brother died. Can we see that? No. Inside everything is in ruins... and it's very dangerous because it might collapse. Although the door works... no one has entered since my brother died. Good morning. Good morning, inspector. Miss, I'm sorry to see you again under such circumstances. - I'm sorry too. It was horrible. - You can go. I know you're concerned and I'm sorry to interrogate you. - But... - Don't worry. Well, I have to tell you... even though it may be inconvenient... I am compelled to ask you a few questions. You can consult an attorney if you wish. Feel free to ask, Inspector. Did you spend the night in the castle? - Yes. - You didn't notice anything? Where you spent such a bad night. I don't know what you're alluding to. But I can assure you that it was a beautiful full moon night. Even though I stayed in my room the whole time. Touch?! You are honest and straightforward. I can get straight to the point. Go on. Haven't you go out all night? I already told you. And did you see anyone go out? - Yes. - Who was it? The butler with his daughter Cristiana. - No one else? - No. And... the Baron Dalmar... - Has he gone out? - No. And how do you know? He could have sneaked out. It's not possible. We were together. The whole night? That's not right, Inspector. Your behavior seems... I want the truth! There were two murders! Tell him, Janos! The inspector is right. He'll find out sooner or later. All night, Inspector. Since your positions are connected... it seems pointless to interrogate you, Mr. Baron. I will notify you when I know the date of the investigation. Remember that statements must be made under oath. See you soon. How it was? For now, both have a common alibi. - They're gone. - Thanks. - For what? - For not having abandoned me. My work is not finished yet. And for lying on my behalf. You could damage your reputation. I despise conventionalisms. And for not believing I killed those women. I believe you did, yes. What? It was you, Janos. You have a split personality. But... this is madness! Read, you know the text. Your case is similar. There's something that puts you... in a kind of trance that makes you commit these atrocities. No! No! No! No! - There are many precedents. - Agreed! I don't dispute what the book says, but that's not my case! I remember everything I do! There is no gap in my mind! It doesn't have to be. You can have two different personalities. And one not knowing the other. It's useless to pretend. We must try to cure you from now on. Where do you go? What do you want to do? If last night's full moon could affect you... perhaps the narcotic contained in the substance could too. Or maybe it's Igor himself! - But Igor is dead. - Not for you! The procedure of regenerating his body to bring it back to life... has become an obsession. And the tension your brain is exposed to... could be the reason for these outbursts. What are you planning to do? No! Be strong. - Why are you helping me? - Out of humanity. - And out of compassion. - Only because of that? - Janos... - There's something else, isn't there? Not now. It's not the right moment. You're right. It's not the right place. And not the right moment either. Go. It's absurd that one can feel happy on a day like today. - I admire you. - Why? For your bravery. If you really believe that I transform at night... aren't you afraid to be the next victim? You wouldn't hurt me because you love me. And does the other love you? No. He hurts me when he takes me to the torture chamber. - What? - He just caresses me. But it doesn't go further because I don't want to. - What do you mean by that? - What's the problem? Tell me about the torture chamber! In my nightmares, I already told you. I thought it was caused by a narcotic. - And you saw me clearly? - If I saw you? I had no doubt it was you. The voice was a little hoarse... but your silhouette was unmistakable. And the tenderness of your hands. But your hands are rough. Janos! Janos! Igor! Igor! Igor. Are you looking for me, brother? Was it you? Don't tell me you didn't know? Come on, Janos. No, I didn't know. What did you think? That those unfortunate ones committed suicide... after dating you? I don't know, but... You were locked in here! I couldn't think you could get out! My dear brother. You have been very naive. - It's very naive to think like that. - But why did you do that? For revenge, Janos! Just for revenge! I was locked in here while you were having fun with them! It's my revenge, Janos! Why do you think you can take justice into your own hands? It was you, but with my hands! You are crazy! The fire not only destroyed your body... but also your brain. The fire cursed you! Don't name it! I can't stand to hear that word! I don't want to see it! It destroyed me and turned me into a monster! And it also ruined me as a man! Everything has changed in me and I don't feel anything anymore! I felt so much hate when you loved them! That's why they had to die. Their bodies... were burning with lust... that's why I killed them! You won't do that anymore. I will report you. And you will pay for everything! No, brother. You won't do it. Have you forgotten the oath we made on our mother's deathbed? We would never hurt each other. And we would always help each other. If not, her soul will never rest. - But not to do that. - I need help, brother. From yours and Ivanna's help. Leave Ivanna alone and I'll forget everything. Stay calm. She is my bride. No, this is not possible. You're a pig too, Janos. Don't you understand? She is the moon, the snow. All that is pure, white and cold. She's the only one who resisted you. Who said no to you. Because she is like me, she hates the flesh and lust. You won't be able to toss and turn in bed with her. Ivanna is mine! But you touched her! Touched her with your repulsive hands! Yes, but as if I caressed a statue, a jewel. Without thinking of anything. Not like you do it. You will never see her again! I'll make her go away! No, brother. Unfortunately, you don't know anything about chemistry. It's she who must carry out and realize the works that I prepare. Here, take. - And let her go on. - No. I need your help... brother. You can't refuse me. You are crazy, Igor. But there are barriers that not even your insanity can overcome. Ivana will never be yours. Remember that. Janos! Janos! What happened to you? Ivanna, let's get married, please. A smart move. The bride cannot testify against her husband. Nor the husband against the wife. - Now they're slipping away. - On the contrary. This is the exact moment... when we can be sure they are guilty. Get out of there. Get away from him. I have nothing against you. It's his life that interests me. His life for my daughter's. Get out or I'll shoot you anyway. I don't mind killing you both! He's not badly hurt, we can bring him in around here. No, it's better to take him to the castle. Tempers are too high here. It's just a flesh wound. Luckily he was nervous and missed the shot. Think no more, my love. I swear to you, Ivanna. I didn't kill those women. I don't care. Otherwise, we wouldn't have gotten married. I didn't kill her. It's okay, it wasn't you. Now, I can't explain it. - Whenever you want. - But you have to believe me. I believe you. But now we must forget everything. It's our wedding night. Please. My love. It's not fair, honey. I've waited for this moment all my life. And you want me to think... about things I don't want to think about. I'm in love with you, you know? But don't believe that you being so important and irresistible... is good for me. I beg you, Janos. What's happening? I don't know. It must be people from the village. For God's sake, Janos! Watch out! I'm in my house and I won't let anyone to intrude! I warned you! I warned you not to touch Ivanna! Janos... come here. Keep yourself this way, pure and innocent... and I will love you forever. I will adore you... to the death. Stay like that, stay like that... with your eyes closed. Oh! Janos... Janos, come here, please. Stay here with me forever. - Come here. - Damn you! Janos, what's the matter? You are like all the others! But... what's up with you? You are like all the others! Maybe worse than them! Janos, what is it? Because you, like everyone else... will die! No! No! Put out that fire! Put out that fire! Run away! Did you think you were done with me? This is my revenge! Janos! Janos, let him burn! There's nothing more we can do for him now. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Janos! Let the fire destroy all the evil he has done.
