Those lovebirds are back. -I don't know what's wrong. -It can happen. That's only ever happened to me when I was sixteen. I'd never done it with a girl and I was on vacation in the countryside. Yes, at your grandparents and the field was full of flowers. You asked if you could kiss her and she took you to the shed. You tell me that story every time you canhet get it up, Samuel. That story you can remember, but not the PIN of your bank card? Those pigeons get on my nerves. I don't love you anymore, Samuel. It's over. Over and done with. Verdorie off. We don't have a job for you. You don't have to come by every day. When we have a job, we'll call you. Why not prime minister? Micheline? It's Samuel. I need to talk to you urgently. Why don't come to my place for dinner tonight? Just dinner. Come on. Call me if you're coming. But don't call too soon, I'm not home yet. I'm not oké. I'm not doing well at all. I'll be home in 15 minutes. If you haven het called, I'll call you, because my answering machine has problems. The people who call me think they left a message but it doesnhet record everything any-- Sorry, it was extremely interesting, but your time is up. Thanks and goodbye. OUT OF ORDER Elevator! It's not coming down. If you kick it too much, it wonhet go up either. Canhet you read? Was it tough to get to my apartment with your vacuum cleaner? -I have not been upstairs. -You're kidding, right? Meneer Samuel, you have not paid me for three months. I'm not Mother Theresa. You're right, I'll pay you, but now is a really bad time. -Did you get a job yet? -Yes, things are starting to move. It has been moving for six months. If you really want to pay, sell your car. -I don't have a car, but I do have a job. -It's the other way around for me. I don't have a job, but I have a car. I need it for my profession. But you have no profession. That is a car to drive to welfare. Have a nice weekend. Ça va? Ça va? Donhet bite my head off. I only said, "Have a nice weekend." I haven het raped you. I'm not leaving for the weekend, but for six months with my fiancé. That's not the point. I expected something more original than "Ça va." -Something like, "Yes, you too. Thanks." -Did I ask you to say something? If you canhet even be kind to people anymore. There is pigeon shit on your shoe. Ça va? Doing well, meneer Troyon? Samuel, it's Patrick. About the loan I promised you, something came up. Sorry. It's a bad time. Samuel, it's Sylvain. The job I talked about... There is a problem. Another time, oké? -Dag, it's Sofie... -Micheline. Something happened. We better not see each other anymore. Stop calling Micheline! Understand? Micheline is mine. Mine, understand? So you and her are done. Micheline and I are getting married, oké? Make a payment or we repossess the car. It's Micheline. If Claude comes by, do not open the door. He said that he was going to punch you. But he wonhet do it. He's not like that. About that dinner, better not, Sam. It's over between us. VARIOUS WAYS TO KILL YOURSELF Hello, you have reached Samuel Bloemensteen. You can leave a message, but I don't think I'll hear it because something came up. I'm dead. Hello, you have reached Samuel Bloemensteen. You can leave a message, but I don't think I'll hear it because something came up. I'm dead. Goodbye. I thought you were gone for six months. I'll apologize first. It's Samuel, your upstairs neighbor. I've come to apologize for what I said. I don't want to interrupt, but-- Goed, I'll be honest. I don't feel well. I need to be able to speak to someone. Are you almost done, meneer Samuel? Shut up, old fart. I am unhappy. Open that door. What is going on, anyway? Are you going to open the door? Sorry, I thought this kind of door would be stronger. You better put a better lock on there, with all the crazy people walking around. Oh, no. -Hello? -Get Micheline, you stupid bastard. Micheline. It's for you. -It's for you. -Hello, Samuel? Micheline, don't marry a guy that you don't know. He was the type that punches someone. Stop calling me when you're down. I'm not your guardian angel. How To Commit Suicide, page 27. Does that mean anything to you? I just wanted to say goodbye. Goodbye. Samuel, wait. No, don't. Give me a reason why I shouldn't. Samuel, there is more than one woman in the world. -There's someone for everyone. -Not for me. A man has more than one woman in his life. Life is full of surprises. Who knows, you might find work tomorrow. You canhet let yourself go like that, because you're down. Everything passes. Samuel? Samuel? Samuel, talk to me. Samuel? Samuel, listen. Water. Hendrik. -But you are not Hendrik. -No, I'm Samuel. Am I dead? -Am I not dead? -Not quite. Is this my apartment? Yes. -Then what are you doing here? -Me? I am your guardian angel. What do you mean? Everyone has a guardian angel. I am yours. You wanted to end it. That reflects badly on me. I have three days to make you want to live again. Without us, there'd be more suicides than Catholics. I'll take you to the countryside. We have a network of houses there. That is my assignment: stay dead or start to live again. I can prove that I am an angel. I can make you invisible. -Invisible? -Yes. Well, it has already happened. Of course, you can see yourself and I can see you too, but for everyone else you are completely invisible. There, gone. -Impossible. -What's the worst that can happen? -But they don't exist. -You have nothing to lose. But what if they do exist? Dag, Mom, it's Samuel. Good, good. No, I'm not dead. That was just a joke. Hé, that key to our country house, it is still hidden in that gnome with the wheelbarrow? Oh, in the plastic Bambi. Yes, it's oké, thank you. No, it's only for a day or three. Yes, this time I will clean up everything. Yes, bye, Mom. A little fresh air is good for you. Are you crazy? Do you think it's summer? I thought that in your condition you could use some fresh air. -Come on, close that thing. -Goed, then I'll close it. What is that? Stuck again. Goddammit. Like you Dutch say. Canhet you fix it? That's weird for someone who can work miracles. I'm a guardian angel, not a mechanic. Here, put on that coat. Advertising from the police. Donhet put me on a pedestal like that. I am not perfect. For example, when I'm alone and reading, I pick my nose and make little balls of it. Bad, right? And I can lie. You wouldnhet think that is possible. For example, my dance lessons. I've never taken a dance class. I follow men around. And before I go home I wet my tights, to make it look like I've been sweating. So you don't go to those dance classes and you stick your fingers up your nose? -Samuel? -And you make balls of it? I heard you. Are you feeling better? The one up there didnhet even give me your name. Geez, you are a ray of sunshine when you wake up. Give me one good reason why I shouldnhet end it. You're too beautiful to die yet. Too beautiful. If you want to be original, say I look intelligent. I didnhet say that you look dumb, did I? My name is Charlyne. That sounds nice, Charlyne. That's not an ordinary name, is it? Does an angel have genitals? Of course not. Genitals no. Your parents gave you a really nice name. -So no genitals. And do you eat? -No. No food. -And angels don't drink either? -No. So no natural needs? There are some names that smell like sweat and other names that automatically make you a CEO. I never met a cleaning lady named Charlyne. So what? Because my name doesnhet smell like sweat, do I have to love life? Hé, there's more than one man on Earth. -There is someone for everyone. -What does an angel know about that? Well? What do you know about heartbreak? What it's like when your lover leaves you for someone else. How it is when you dream the two of you are in bed but when you wake up and are by yourself. How to go crazy with self-pity and jealousy. Can you cry? What do you know about angels? Do you know whether an angel can fall in love? You canhet even hang yourself, yet you're going to explain life to me. You must've been great fun to be with. Now I understand why he left. Charlyne. Charlyne. Sorry. -Charlyne, I have to tell you something. -Never mind. You are absolutely right. -I always screw up everything. -We started off on the wrong foot. -That's all. -Of course, the wrong foot! Forget that I'm an angel. We'll pretend that we are two lovers who go away for a weekend. -Can an angel fantasize? -Yes, but-- Goed then. We are in love and we go on a trip. Two lovers. You know... love is like alcohol. If you've had a little too much to drink you'll need a drink the next day to get rid of the hangover. Driver, off to the countryside. Charlyne. I really have to tell you... Two lovers. ...you have to stop doing stunts like that, because I'll have to explain that upstairs. Charlyne, don't be silly. -We are pretending, right? -Yes, but... Tell me, how was the beginning of our love affair? -What do you want me to say to that? -The first meeting, our first kiss. All those little things that they ask you afterwards. -So, how we met... -Yes. The first time I met you, I was blinded by your beauty. I had to squint my eyes, otherwise, I would've had to use a seeing-eye dog for the rest of my life. -Something like that? -Yes, keep going. You wore a beautiful lace dress with those little frills. That would surprise me, because I hate lace and frills. Charlyne, this is enough. What is wrong? I didnhet mean any harm. But frame me as a simple country girl and I canhet fantasize any further. If you can do it better, then tell me. How was the first time that we kissed? -Our first kiss? -Yes, the first kiss. -The first kiss? -Yes, the one with lips and our tongue. I had just moved and I went downstairs to take out the garbage. When I got there, you were there too. You turned around, looked at me and it was love at first sight. Our first kiss was between the garbage bags? Wait. I wore a dress with a lot of frills, because you love that, right? Hé, watch out. "So Abraham went down to Egypt to live there as a foreigner, -because there was famine..." -Was it this one? Hmm? Yes, I think so, yes. "And it came to pass when--" You think so? Then why does it smell like fabric softener? You didnhet sweat in class? You even sweat when you slow dance. -I don't remember. -You don't? Samuel, I'll be right back. This is not a good time, Claude. Excuse me, could we borrow that hose? We have a bit of a problem. I don't lend out anything. That garden hose is owned by the city and I am responsible for it. -Yes? -Would you rather wash it yourself? I don't know. I'll have to think about that. -That's extra work, isnhet it? -But I'll pay you for it. -We'll see about that. -We'll take care of it. I'll get you something to drink. -Make me invisible. -Invisible? Why? You're not leaving me with that creep? -That makes me uncomfortable. -It's not that simple. I have no right. There must be a valid reason. -Well, then I'll go with you. -No, stay there. Sometimes, I abuse my gift. Well, it happened. Invisible. -The car you are going to wash... -300 francs. -Yes, but there is a girl in that car. -Should I wash her too? No. That's a hitchhiker that I picked up. She thinks that she is invisible. I've been pretending that I believe her. She's... a little crazy, but I don't care. I don't live with her. I only want to have a nice... Get it? If you wash that car, will you pretend you don't see her? Then she doesnhet make any problems. Six hundred francs. -Tell me you're my... -Micheline, dance. -What? -Dance. If you take classes twice a week, then dance. Claude, please. And? I'm going to get some things. That you keep listening means that you expect something from life, that you hope that... -One moment. What is this? -So you don't want to dance? I'm doing everything to keep him alive. How can you base our future on a lie? I didnhet lie, Claude. I went to dance class this morning. So, dance. And five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, four, five and six, seven, eight and one, two. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So? Claude. Samuel, you just did me a great favor. Thanks. Do angels vomit? You don't eat. Yeah, but you gotta understand, we live on the happiness of others. So when we run into a lot of misery, it chokes us. And I encountered someone in that store... I'll spare you the story. But it was horrible. I believe you. And it gave me time to almost finish my book. -What is that? -I found it in the glove box. Do angels read this kind of trash? I do not know. I didnhet know it was there. -Hot Nights with Paprika. -That's a nice title. Ridiculous how little is in it. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. -Apparently, you are a connoisseur. -So what? It is forbidden up there to be interested in something like that? Not at all. On the contrary. -Sex is sacred to us. -But sex isnhet sacred at all. Everybody does it. Dogs, horses, pigs. Even whales. Sex has nothing to do with being holy. It's just damn good. Is there a garage open in the area? Us farmers say "good evening" when we barge in somewhere. -Good evening. -Good evening. Good evening. What can I do for you? -Is there a garage open in the area? -There's no garage here at all. Just kidding. My son has a garage, but he is in the kitchen. Come back tomorrow. What do we do now? -Can we get two rooms? -No. There is only one available. With a large bed. That makes it cheaper and the memory more interesting. Goed. Room 12. Here's the key, but there is no door on it. Just kidding. I canhet go with you, the food is getting cold. -Is there still something to eat? -No, nothing left. Just kidding. You must go straight to the dining room, because the kitchen is closing. -CanHet i freshen up a bit? -No. That is not a joke. There is no time for that. Jimmy! Get the luggage. Tasty. You don't get a menu. We only have mussels. Too bad that you don't know how delicious food can be. I'm not aware of it, so I don't miss anything. -Do you know how to toast? -Of course. -To your second life. -To the day you get a dick. Yes. Come on. No food, no sex. How do you go wild up there? We masturbate. Samuel, respond. Please, say something. Goed, this is what psychoanalysts call transfer of fear. But I am not playing that game. You goddamn, bastard. It's your fault that Claude is gone. And I am constantly eating things that make me fat. So, if I understand correctly, there is only one god. -But there are several religions? -Yes, but Charlyne-- -Yes? -We're just pretending, right? Well, look into my eyes. About that angel thing... I have to tell you something very serious. But that doesnhet explain why there are so many different religions. You drank too much. You don't speak about god when you're drunk. Sex is sacred, whales donHet french kiss, and you don't talk about god when you are drunk. -Come on, let's go to bed. -To bed? To do what? What do I care that everyone is listening. Hé, I have a problem. This man here, Samuel, wants to sleep with me. And I want to. Why not? But, and listen up, Samuel has no wiener. In that case, it is a no for me. Am I right? Yes, for sure. So why are there so many different religions? Charlyne, listen for two minutes. Do you mind if this gentleman sits at your table? Of course, we were engaged in an intimate conversation. -Canhet you put him over there? -Those are regular customers. -They don't want to be disturbed. -And we do? -Come and have a good time. -I don't want to intrude. Not at all. We only have cold herring because the kitchen is closed. So, maybe you can tell me how it is that-- What? How is it that there is only one god, but there are many different religions? -I don't know. Good evening, sir. -Good evening. I think that it's sort of the same as laundry detergents. Maybe the more products there are, the more they sell? But I'm not sure. Well, that could be the case. Yes. Well, different topic. Do you have a wiener? Goed, I'm off. Shut up or I'll break your glasses. -Excuse me, I think your husband... -No, that's my guardian angel. He found me when I tried to hang myself. And here I am. Congratulations. Laundry detergent. -Samuel. -Yes? -Are you mad? -No. Are you jealous? -Me? No. No? I would love it if you were jealous. May I come in? No, no. Yes, yes. I have to-- I have to-- Nice toiletry bag. What is that? What are you doing? Are you calling Our Lord? That black suitcase and coat aren het ours. I'm calling the front desk. That's not a... mistake. They're mine. I may not have a wiener, but I can still count to two. We left with my leather bag and your suitcase. That's two. I know that, but they are mine. Hang up and I'll explain. Hello? Just kidding. -Goed, explain. -You wonhet be happy. That is disappointing, because until now I have really enjoyed myself. When you made me invisible, I went on a little rampage. You're kidding. Do you think I get the chance to be invisible every day? -Did anyone see you? -No, because I was invisible. You know for sure that no one has seen you? -No, I was invisible after all. -Geez Louise. You may have been! But if they saw how that suitcase crawled into my car by itself, they could've written down my plate. How can you be so stupid? I wonhet bother you anymore. Charlyne. Are you taking a shower? Charlyne. You're not doing anything stupid, right? Come on, it's oké. Do you know what we'll do? Tonight, we'll forget everything. And tomorrow, we will look for an address in that suitcase and we will send it back. But they are not from the same person. What do you mean? That suitcase and the coat belong to two different people. That's oké, then I'll look in the suitcase and in the coat. There's nothing special in that suitcase. Just socks. I found an address. We'll send it all back tomorrow, come on. Charlyne, come out. We are two smitten seahorses, right? You know what? We are going to sleep and tell each other sweet things and memories and stuff. And and sweet things. Are you feeling better? -Do you have keys in your pocket? -No. -I thought you had no genitals? -Actually, I don't. But they gave me a male human body and they put something there, but that thing doesnhet work. So I can push against you like that and that doesnhet affect you at all? No. Gosh, how reassuring to be with a man -who has no ulterior motives. -Really? Sometimes you just want a little tenderness from a friend. But such a small gesture, like this, is often sufficient to make a man prance. Come on. Of course, you canhet understand, but if you do this... That's like a code that means: there is a good chance that I'll agree. That is great. And if you do this... Then that means that you hope that he takes action. -Yes? -Uh-huh. And I've even known a guy where it was enough to just do this for a moment. And he'd get a cannon that could shoot straight through a closet. Oh, yeah? Me too. -Is an angel allowed to do this? -I'll pretend. I'll pretend. You have to do it with an angel to understand -the saying, "to be in seventh heaven." -That's just the beginning. Donhet forget, what seventh heaven is for you, is only ground floor for us. Charlyne? I am not an angel. I have no gift whatsoever and you have never been invisible. Everyone saw how you stole that suitcase and coat. I had sex all night with someone I don't know? That is not important... What important is what has grown between us. What do you mean, not important? You raped a dead person. Necrophiliac. Donhet be so hysterical. I haven het raped anyone. You're always stirring me up with your talk about genitals. -You wanted to do it with an angel. -I haven het stirred up anyone. You jumped me. I was not in my right mind. I wanted to die. You know what I was doing when you were fumbling with your rope? I about to kill myself too, but I came to save you. -I didnhet ask you to. -You can thank me anyway. Well, thanks so much. It was standing in a corner. -What was in a corner? -That suitcase. We will return it. We can keep it too. Those socks would look nice on me. -An honest person doesnhet do such a thing. -No? But I'm not an angel, remember? After five years it was over. Her name was Micheline. -Why was it over? -Would you stay with someone who always lies, is untidy and just fumbles around in bed? -Probably not. -Neither did she. She left me. How long had you been with your sweetheart? I'm cold. Thank you. Wonhet you tell me? Too bad, I would have liked to know. Do you have a problem with that? -We're just pretending, right? -Yes. Donhet all lovers talk about their previous experiences? Yes. Wait, if I don't tell you how I saved my younger sister from drowning, you will never know what kind of brave hero is standing here. And if I don't tell you about all my affairs, you'll never realize what kind of a turbo lover you caught. Goed, where do I start? Sex or heroics? Difficult choice. Goed, from the start. The first time you did it with a girl, turbo lover. Goed... but the last time I talked about my first time, it didnhet turn out so well. Is that a problem? Donhet all lovers tell each other about their first time? But don't laugh. The first time, there were flowers everywhere. I was on vacation at my grandparents in the countryside. Every afternoon, a bunch of girls were playing in a meadow. There was one girl with white socks and I was a bit in love with her. Sometimes I looked at her from the fence, but I was afraid to go play with her. Once I did ask her to go on a walk with me. And she said yes. I looked straight into her eyes and held her hand. And she took me to her father 's shed. And we kissed each other and that was fantastic. And the following holiday, she moved and I never saw her again. Too bad, otherwise she could have given those 1,000 francs back to you. You ran off so quickly, that she didnhet have the time to. I canhet look at you anymore. How do you know about that? Charlyne. Charlyne. Charlyne. Charlyne. Samuel. Where were you? -Here. -But how do you do that? Samuel. I am your guardian angel. A real angel. No, wait a minute. That idea of the angel was my idea. I came up with that in the moment and now you are telling me that you are a real angel. That's a coincidence. Maybe angels create coincidences. If your neighbor hadnhet turned up her music too loud at the right moment... If my neighbor is my guardian angel, she wouldnhet leave for six months, just when I'm going to kill myself. It was because your neighbor left that I could take her place. If the landlady had been away, I would have taken her place. No, something is wrong here... Is this better, meneer Samuel? May I remind you that you are still three months behind on your rent? -Charlyne. -Samuel. Why did you not tell me before? You said it yourself. All lovers first talk about their past and then slowly move over to their future. That's where our problem is, we have no future. We have to find something to end our relationship. I am the bandage on the wound called Micheline and if that bandage stays on too long, the wound gets infected. Lovely image. -We were pretending, weren het we? -Yes. But it was so nice. But shall we ever see each other again? Yes and no. Yes, we will or no, we won't? Will anything remain from that first kiss and everything last night? A lot. Just not me. But what's the point of saving my life when you leave me even more depressed? How do you like my legs? Nicer than Micheline's? That's pure moral cruelty. Micheline can go jump into the canal with her Claude. If Micheline leaves you cold today, it was pointless kill yourself yesterday. Is it better that I take poison to get over you tomorrow? I'd wait until the day after tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow you'll tell a girl that I can jump into the canal. Charlyne, I don't want to never see you again. No, that's too easy. Charlyne. Samuel. Charlyne? I forgot to tell you something. Bring back that stolen suitcase. An angel is not allowed to steal. Is that your goodbye? That's great. No, you can keep the coat. It might bring you luck. The coat? Are angels cynical? No, but angels find it hard to say goodbye. Then why canhet we not see each other again? Charlyne. Charlyne? Now I'm all alone again. Easy to vanish without leaving an address. Is that how they do things up there? Well, thanks so much. I'm just a simple person, not perfect like you, but I never left like a thief in the night. Never. Samuel, the time has come. Samuel, I'm counting to twenty. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... ...thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, eighteen, nineteen, nineteen and a half, nineteen-- Micheline, it's me. I forgot my keys, open up. Micheline. I want to talk to you. I haven het slept all night. You really are a bitch. If you keep acting like that, I wonder if I should have just let you sit there with your nose balls. Are these yours, sir? -Yes. -There you go. Thank you. Micheline? Micheline, but-- Come here. Excuse me does a certain meneer Colombani work here? Yes, do you have an appointment? No, but I found this and it had his name in it. Just take a seat near that pencil. I will inform the director. Meneer Director? Yes, it's Linda. There is a man here who claims he found a suitcase of yours somewhere. Maybe we should call security. Goed. Yes, immediately, meneer Director. Will you follow me, please? -Yes? -Meneer Director... Yes, leave us and close the door. You can check everything, no sock is missing. Great job. Thanks. Wonderful. Gerard Colombani. How can I thank you? -I have only done what's right. -No, you could have kept it. No, I am not like that. Take a seat. In a company, it is sometimes necessary to make sure a certain transfer of funds is handled discreetly. That's why I wanted to thank you personally. Thank you. I will not offend you by offering you money. -Right, what could I do with it? -But if I can ever do you a favor. Good evening. Meneer Samuel, I've already set the table. -It is beautiful. -Nice, right, those candles? -I got them myself. -Thanks. Meneer Samuel, there is no more cleaner left. Shall I buy some? -Yes, that's fine. -Goed, then I'll see you Friday. Yes, I'll see you on Friday. -See you on Friday. -Until Friday. This is Patrick. I have to ask something. A small favor, 20,000 francs. You'll have it back at the end of the month. I can count on you, right? Samuel, it's Sofie. Haven het heard from you in a long time. Will you give me a call? Kisses. He's not like that. About that dinner, better not. It's over between us. If you can do miracles, why don't you leave a message on it? That should be possible. -Go ahead. -Excuse me. Can I offer you something? Do you have a cocktail with pineapple, banana, coconut milk? No. Carrot juice? No, I just like cocktails with pineapple, banana and coconut milk. Champagne? If you don't have anything else. I don't want to be difficult. Have a seat. It's my first time having dinner with a colleague. It's not my style. -Do you usually get laid without dinner? -Excuse me? No, I keep work private I keep work and private separate. -I keep them separate. -It was just a joke. Just kidding. Please. To your eternal beauty. Thanks. The first time I saw you, I would never have expected to ever dine with you... But the first time that you saw me, you didnhet look at me properly. No, I did, you were ugly and totally unkempt. -Do you want me to be really honest? -Yes, be honest. I still don't understand why he hired you. You have misunderstood. You've only seen the tip of my iceberg. But that also counts, the tip. I mean, what's underneath counts as well, right? Everything actually counts. That's right, but what was most striking to me, were your hands. -You really have beautiful hands. -You're not the first to say that. I really have a soft spot for hands. There are breathtaking women and when you see their hands, it's a letdown. These neurotics that bite off their nails. My hair too. They say I have beautiful hair. Yes, indeed, everything about you, everything. The first time I saw you, I was blinded by your beauty. I had to squint my eyes, otherwise... Yeah, otherwise, you had to use a seeing-eye dog for the rest of my life. Charlyne. We can see each other again? Did you think I was that slut over there? No. Then why are giving her the same compliments that you gave me? -You're jealous, aren het you? -Me? Not at all. But you don't need to recycle our declarations of love. But there is no love here at all. That bitch just wants to get promoted. She's a bandage on a bandage. -Then why are you pretending with her? -I'm not pretending. I'm trying my best. But I miss you. Do you think it's normal to kiss this handkerchief three times a day? The lipstick is almost completely gone. That's not normal, is it? Come, I will show you something else. Come, I'll show you. Look, the hotel bill from when spent the night. In the evening, I look at it and cry myself to sleep. -Do you think that's normal? -No. -We absolutely must see each other again. -Samuel, I no longer exist. But why do you always show up? -I haven't, I'm right there. -But I can see and smell you. Let me touch you for a change. If you want to touch an idea in your head, be my guest. Charlyne. Charlyne. But I didnhet even thank you yet for Colombani. Thanks. Cheers. Cheers. -Enjoy. -Thank you. Enjoy, both of you. He is dearer to me than my family. Leave that woman alone. -Does it shock you when I say that? -No, I love animals. -I had a turtle myself. -They feel that. They have an instinct. Yes, a dog is nothing but instinct, with hair on it. If you start talking about the weather as well, she will be so impressed. They say they're man's best friend. It's true. -Yes, you can count on a dog. -Absolutely. You have to take him out twice a day, so he doesnhet piss on your carpet. You are never alone with a dog. You are never alone with a dog. No, no. She says it. A dog is the best friend for those who have no friends of their own. You'll have a bit of fun and then she'll start yapping again. Just drop her. -Is something wrong? -And all of this for a quickie. Take matters into your own hands. That saves time. Admit it, no foreplay, and if it makes you deaf, I will speak a little louder. Do you think that's funny, you idiot? -Claude. -Samuel. Micheline. Sorry, I had no control over my hand. How are you? -Great. Are you free the 27th? -The-- Yes. Goed, then you are invited to our wedding. That's great. -And you can bring your date. -That's fine. Are you doing oké? I am good. I found a job. I am completely on top of it. I am fine. It's going great. It's really going It's great. I am doing good. So good. Away. Go away. Yes, and now to the right ear, yes. Kiss, kiss, kiss. And then slowly to the left, yes. And now slowly go down. Hé! Fine. -Now I'm all excited. -I'm excited too. -I'm about to collapse. -It's the third time that I've been here and the third time you stopped halfway. Are you impotent or something? Can you change into my landlady? That is the only thing that still excites me these days. Forget it. You don't understand anything. You wonhet see me again. I will have to live with that. No, Charlyne, please. I canhet take it anymore. You must stop. It's driving me crazy. Stop this. I canhet take it anymore. You have to leave me alone. Good evening, meneer Bloemensteen. Stop that nonsense. I am not thinking of you anymore. Go away, disappear. Charlyne, because of you I might never get an erection again. But, my name is not Charlyne. My name is Sandrine. Sa Sandrine. I signed up for an acting class and I was trying my lines on you. I see it is working. Yes, great. Weren het you gone for six months with your fiancé? -My ex-fiancé, yes. -Ex-- Ah. Sorry for the last time we spoke. I was a little rude. Ça va? Ça va. Thank you. And you? Do you always dress like that when you take the garbage out? No, I was going to a costume ball, but something went wrong. I understand. There was a leak upstairs and it has been dripping in here. But it was fixed. While you were gone. -Well, bye, meneer Bloemensteen. -Call me Samuel. Goodbye, Samuel. Forget everything I said. Awesome, you angels. Great work. I'm counting on you. Good evening, I thought, because something happened, we could... Excuse me. I'll be back. But, come in. Hello. -Hello. -Are you the babysitter? -No, I'm the upstairs neighbor. -Shame. We were to go to a costume ball and the babysitter didnhet come. That is unfortunate. I've put in a lot of effort to find this Pinocchio costume. Look at my nose when I lie. Look at my nose. I am Fred Flintstone. -Isnhet it great? -Phenomenal. Your friend told me about the babysitter. -If you want, I can babysit. -Are you serious? -It could go late. -I had nothing else to do anyway. I wanted to take you to a restaurant, but we'll do that another time. Very sweet of you. You'll really help me out. We'll do that dinner some other time. -Bertha, this is Samuel. -Bertha is a very beautiful name. I like it a lot. He's going to look after you. Will you be nice to him? -I didnhet know you had a child. -It's my sister's. -She's divorced. A stewardess. -That's difficult on a plane. Goed if I leave you alone for a bit? I'll make something to eat. Let's jump. There, pinch your own nose. No, don't do that. Such a good girl. You are not starting that again, right? Get out of here. You are a ray of sunshine when you wake up. -Did you lose Pinocchio on the way? -He left with Tom Thumb. Was Bertha good? Yes, but she's not very fond of spinach. I'm sorry, I'll pay for the dry cleaning. No, that's not important. It's too good to be true, isnhet it? -I don't understand what you mean. -Neither do I, but never mind. I'll let you go to sleep. Yes, I look ridiculous, but it's not mine. -I can see that, it is mine. How did you get that coat? It was stolen in a cafe somewhere, four months ago. So, tell me. How did you get that coat? Did it fall from the sky or something? Give it a try. Go, walk. Yes, walk to Mommy. -Well done. -Well done! In the playpen. Go ahead. -Mama. -The toy. Ah, the bear. Let's call grandma. -Dag, Grandma. Hello. -Hi. I'll get it. Look, Daddy found the little bear! -And? Who was it? -It was your mother. Plastic Bambi got stolen and she canhet get into her country house.
