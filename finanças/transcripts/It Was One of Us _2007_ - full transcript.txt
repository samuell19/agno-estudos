[♪] [Woman screams] Emily... Emily! [Gasps] Geez, em... [Giggl [giggling] You'd think I was killing you. Oh, no, that's the sound of me having fun. I thought you'd want to keep the noise level down. Why? The nanny's out with the kids, and Howard won't be home for hours. Well, can I interest you in a repeat performance? Sure, I don't have to be anywhere until 3:00. Oh, my god! It's 2:55? How long were you down there? No, you got to get dressed! I got five minutes to get to the hair salon. Your hair looks fine. Are you insane? I'm going to my 10th college reunion tomorrow, and fine isn't good enough. My hair better be perfect. Thank you, Dr. Hohn. You're welcome. Now, eat right, and wash with that soap I gave you. Okay. And remember, you will outgrow this. Probably. Jessica, do I have any more patients? No, that was the last. Then I am off to Boston! The stock's a dog, and I'm talking great Dane. Woof. Woof. Listen, I've got to hop. It's crunch time, hartman. The flender deal's falling apart. You call the lawyer, I'll see if I can get haskell on the phone-- you're on your own, Tom. I'm going out of town, and I won't be back in the office until Sunday. No, no, you can't leave. I mean, you never leave. Unless... Oh, my god, what, did your mother die? Nope. I've got my college reunion, and it's a big one. Oh, what is it, your 20th? My 10th, but thanks. Sorry. So, what do I tell haskell? The truth. That my mother died. [♪] Hi! Hi! Oh, Wendy, it's so good to see you! What's in the box? I brought copies of my book for everyone. "Stowe and the 19th century narrative: A Neo-feminist re-interpretation." Catchy title. Hey, do you mind driving? I haven't slept in two nights, so if we want to make it to the reunion alive... Are you kidding? I love this car. When did you get it? About a year ago. 1,028 miles? I don't get out much. Too much work. Me too, only college professors can't afford cars like this. All right, I can't wait to see the fabulous five together again. Rock and roll. [♪] Here are the results to our online class survey, so thanks to all who responded, especially those of you who told the truth. [Laughter] Starting with the home life category, 38% of our class resides in an urban setting, while 41% have chosen the suburbs. 13% are in rural areas. 7% live overseas, and one classm and one classmate put "other." Bet that was reade from our freshman dorm. He lives on the space station. Turning to the workplace, we have a record number of lawyers in our class, so don't drop your wine glass. [Laughter] Financial services is the next biggest group, followed by small business owners and medical practitioners, with education bringing up the rear. Where were you? And now, while 12% of the males earn over $200,000 a year, only 1% of the females do. You. You. I am a god, which explains why I have this. Is that the key to our old room? Where'd you get it? Gave the security guard 20 bucks. What a shame, when I could have charmed it out of him. 10 years, and you haven't changed a bit. That's not true. My lingerie is much more expensive now. [Giggling] Shh! [Giggling] Open it. Wow, it looks so... Drab. Not when we lived here. And small. Did they change the windows? I don't think they changed them... Or cleaned them. Damn! It's not here anymore. What? Something I wrote on the wall. What? A list of every guy she dated our senior year. Wouldn't that have covered the whole wall? I wrote small! Oh, I have to call my husband. Carson! Come check these out. Our old bunk beds. I hate to think that you were the last person I slept with for any length of time. Maybe that's because you insisted on being on top. [Sproing] There's no one I have to call. How about you? I could call Ron, but I'd just as soon skip it. Why aren't you and Ron living together? It's been, what, eight years? Only seven. No wonder you're not ready to settle down. He keeps asking me to marry him, and every time, we have the same fight. I finally told him, if he asks me one more time-- no, you don't! No gossiping until we can all hear. Nice. Come on. Try the organic Mac and cheese in the freezer. She likes that. Help me move these couches, and nobody says another word until Teddy's off the phone. Okay, give them a kiss for me. I'll be home before dinner tomorrow night. Okay, bye. We're not all here anyway. Are you sure avis is coming? Her email said she was flying in from Paris today, but I haven't actually spoken to her in ages. Well, avis better show. She's the one I really came to see. Nice, Teddy. Real nice. Yeah, thanks a lot. I just meant I see you guys all the time. [Cell phone ringing] Hi, Howard. Yes, I'm here. Hi, Howard. Yes, they're here. Yes, it's fun. Okay, talk to you later. Mwah. Amazing. After all those years together, you still have such sparkling conversations. Howard is a wonderful husband and father... Who just made partner at a prestigious law firm. But if I tell him about the reunion now, what will I have to talk to him about the seven nights a week we're in bed together? [Laughing] It has always amazed me, em, how you, who had who had a different boyfriend every week, turned out to be the first one of US to settle down and get married. I was pretty impressive in those days. That's not the word I was thinking of. Okay, you guys, tell me the truth. It's been 10 pounds-- years... Since we lived in this cruddy dorm room together. Who wouldn't want to go back to college again? I don't miss going to class, but I do miss sitting around talking with you guys all night. What the hell did we find to go on about for all those years? Classes, tests-- boys! Food-- boys! Professors-- boys! Remember when the entire varsity crew team was in love with avis, and not the two-man skull, but the eight-man shell. Yeah, but she only dated one at a time. That was one of her rules. Avis had three rules about having a great date. No, she had three rules for having a great party. Remind me again. Always invite more boys than girls. Keep the lights down low... And always have plenty of booze! [All]: Avis! You made it! [Squealing] I wouldn't have missed seeing you guys for the world. Give me these. Hi! [♪] ♪ My sister sunshine ♪ ♪ sweet honey so fine ♪ ♪ my little soul-shaker girl ♪ ♪ my sister starlight ♪ ♪ she'll take you so high ♪ ♪ I'm blown out of this world ♪ We're not going to stay long, right? I only want to see a few people. Tell the truth. How do I look? A little trashy. Then we're all set. When it comes to Don quixote, I teach the Grossman translation. Frankly, the others don't come close. My base is Paris, but I'm actually thinking of moving to Barcelona. My company has offices in Barcelona. Next time I'm there, I'd love to take you for dinner. Uh, yeah, maybe. [Giggles] Hey, what are you drinking? Club soda. Can I get you another one? I think I'm good. Is it just me, or does avis look a little washed out? I noticed that too. She's still beautiful, of course, but... She's lost something. I would kill for her figure, though. Don't be silly. You look great. No, I don't. How do you stay so thin? The investment banker's diet, work through lunch, and get home too late and too tired for dinner. I don't recommend it. [Giggling] Oh, my god, what's Emily doing? Yoo! Thank you so much. It's so good to see you! Who's the guy I was just dancing with? Fred Rockwell. Sounds familiar. You were madly in love with him for almost a week. Ha having fun? Emily is. Has Teddy put a little weight on? It was the second kid that did it. She gained over 50 pounds with that one. I have two kids, too, and I still look gorgeous. Mm, your highlights are a little ashy. I like the last colour better. You didn't even see the last colour. Well, it had to be better. [Laughing] Seen enough, avis? I am so done. Hey, I'm thinking about a junk food run. Anyone want to come with? Yeah!

How much have I had? Aw, that's the beauty of drinking straight nobody ever counts the glasses. I wish I hadn't quit smoking. Did you do it for the kids? That and my skin. Okay, let's get to the good stuff. Avis, we came all this way to hear out about the amazing men of Europe. Oh, yeah! Start with who gave you that gorgeous canary diamond ring. Emily, don't you remember anything? Apparently not. My grandmother gave me this ring when I graduated. I never wore it back then. Diamonds didn't exactly go with grunge. [Chuckling] But now I never take it off, and there is no special man in my life. What about you guys? US? Nothing new nothing new in that department. Speak for yourself. What's that supposed to mean, Mrs. Winstead? Mrs. Winstead has a few stories, tell US! Tell, tell, tell, tell I am not going to be the only one to kiss and tell. I'm sure every single one of you has done something naughty in the last 10 years. I will open up only if you will. Oh, well, pass the champagne. I need to be really drunk for this. I'll go first. Shocking. You guys all know how devoted I am to Howard. Hmm... What? I'm the model wife and mother. It's just that recently, when Howard's at work and the kids are out, I like to indulge in a little extra-curricular fun. Don't tell me you're screwing the gardener. It's too cliche. No, I have been enjoying the company of a mega-hot yoga instructor named Caleb. He really opened up my hip flexors. [Laughing] And Howard is okay with this? Howard doesn't know about this. It's not a big deal. It's just something I do to keep me busy. Oh, come on. It's your turn. What naughty thing have you done, Wendy? Give me the bottle. Whoever's speaking should have the bottle. I did Emily one better. She did something immoral. I did something illegal. You know that merger between caliber petroleum and melcott? I worked for nine months, day and night, on that deal. You canceled out on Thanksgiving because of it, right? I canceled out on my life because of that. So I used this account that I manage for my aunt Laura and bought a chunk of caliber petroleum just before the announcement. Isn't that insider trading? It wasn't legal, but it was definitely fair. How much did you make? A lot. Now I own a park Avenue apartment that I never go home to, and a Porsche I never drive. Waa, waa... Aw... Oh, boo hoo. Poor baby. Now, who else can boast about doing something outside the law? What? No! Yes! No! Sometimes I hate my practice. It's all those rich women coming in to get Botox to tide them over till their next facelift. It makes me sick that I went to med school for this, but we have a mortgage and two kids, and, as fate would have it, one day, I found a way to generate a little extra income. Teddy, you've become a hooker? [Laughing] A patient came in claiming she had a rash, and I didn't see anything. So she said that she'd be fine if I gave her a prescrip turns out, my predecessor had a little side business, so I went with it. That's not so bad. Are you kidding? What? You can get any med you want over the Internet. I can't defend it. I can't even tell John about it, but I've stopped doing it completely. It wasn't worth it. Bottle, bottle! Who gets the bottle? Your turn. Oh... I... Was asked to give a talk at a melville symposium, and then promptly forgot about it. A week before, they called, and I had nothing. Fortunately, a grad student of mine had written a decent essay on sexual imagery in Moby dick. So I took it, and recited it... Verbatim. That's it? A little plagiarism? In my circles, plagiarism is a very big deal. So why'd you do it? It was an all-expense paid weekend in the berkshires, and I needed a vacation. Oh... I know! It sounds pathetic. Oh, you're all pathetic. I was hoping for some really juicy gossip. Avis, you are my last hope. And I always come through for my friends. How's this? Last year, I spent three months at the wentworth clinic in Miami. Wentworth is a serious detox clinic, right? And I had a serious problem. I haven't had a sip all night. I was in Miami for a new year's Eve party that lasted about a week. We were doing shot after shot, bump after bump, when something just suddenly snapped in my head, and then everything went blissfully silent. And when I woke up, I was in wentworth. I didn't even tell my parents. If this got out, it could really harm someone I love. Why didn't you call? I had no idea. Avis... Me too. We all would have. I need to sort things out for myself. The wentworth motto is "every day, better and stronger," and that's how I feel, better and stronger, and it's good to finally be open about it. You guys are the best. Aw... Hello! I'm home! Where's my welcoming committee? Kids are at the park with Rachel. I was just catching up with some work, watching a little golf. How was your reunion? It was great. You know, seeing all five of US together made me realize... Yes? I've definitely aged the best. [Chuckles] Don't run her over. Will we see you again, avis? I hope so. I just don't know how long I'll be in New York. Are you staying with your parents? Ugh, god, no. They'd keep me on a 10:00 curfew. I'm in the middle of a big deal, but maybe Wednesday we can all meet up for drinks? I mean, a coffee? Yeah, coffee sounds great. I'm up for anything. I'll have my assistant set it up. Avis... Love you, Carson! Bye! Whoo! [Wendy]: I did Emily one better. She did something immoral, I did something illegal. I used an account that I manage for my aunt Laura and bought a chunk of caliber petroleum just before the announcement. [Emily]: I have been enjoying the company of a mega-hot yoga instructor named Caleb. He really opened up my hip flexors. So, I took it, and recited it... Verbatim. ...and I had a serious problem. That's why I didn't take a sip all night. Turns out my predecessor had a little side business, so I went with it. Give it to me, you jerk! You're the jerk, jerk! Take it easy, kids. Ow! Mom, he pulled my hair! She stole my ball! There's a letter for you, Ms. Monroe. Oh, thanks. Hi, honey. What are you reading? Nothing, just a letter from the college requesting money. Again? Didn't you just give at your reunion? Apparently, they want more. Any other mail? No, no, nothing, just bills. Lots of bills. Leave 20,000... [Gasping] [Sighs] You're late. I'm sorry, the kids needed me to read a book to them. Let's see the letter. They all match. Same type and postmark. Well, well, it's the fabulous five feeling less than fabulous. Do you really need another cookie? No, but I really want another cookie, Carson. So, what now? Do we have to pay this? Yeah, couldn't we take some action? I'm not going to be the one who runs to the police, are you? No police. No, please. I thought you quit smoking. I did. You're still quit in my apartment. Okay, first, we need to figure out who the blackmailer is. Obviously, the room was bugged, or someone was listening next doo those walls are very thin. We used to complain about that all the time. For god's sakes, Emily. What? It was one of US. Let's skip the denials and go straight to the accusations. Teddy... You keep telling US how worried you are about money. Worried enough to try a little extortion? What? I'm the most honest one in here, and you know it. Well, just for the sake of clarity, what did you call that little prescription scam you had going? What? "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone." Little miss plagiarism. And while we're discussing money, how much, or, I'm sorry, how little income did you make last year? Enough for me. Unlike you, I don't have two screaming brats and a house I can't afford. Okay, can we just please calm down? Or at least get organized? Yes. Now, Teddy and Carson both have financial motives. The rest of US all have plenty of money. Right, no motive. But there's something more important than money. Our health? Men. What's the one thing all of US have that Wendy lacks? She's right. Wendy, you've always been the most competitive. It must be killing you that Emily and I both have husbands, and Carson has Ron, and avis has... Well, anyone she wants. Hmm. That's ridiculous. What about you, Emily? So bored with life in the suburbs, you'll do anything for fun, like commit adultery, or maybe a little blackmail? I seem to remember this the game of tell-all was your idea. That's true, although I didn't know until after we played that you were a thief who would cheat to make money whether you needed it or not. Well, we've really narrowed it down. We're all suspects. Except avis. Oh, I was wondering when it would be my turn. What motive does avis have? Most crimes are committed by people with drug problems. So she says. How can you even doubt it? It's okay. I know the truth. I'm just not going to pay the 20 grand. There. Problem solved. What about Howard finding out? It's not going to get that far. We're going to figure out who's doing this. You're not teaching this semester, so I know you have some free time. I was going to go to england. I guess I can't afford to. Ever. If we find out who did it in time, you'll still get your vacation. All we have to do is come up with some sort of a plan to nail the perp. You watch way too many crime shows. Let's review. Teddy's a drug-peddler. Wendy's a white-collar criminal. Avis is a junkie. And you're a nymphomaniac, and I'm a cheat, but the one thing that I don't get about any of this is that whoever's doing this is just as vulnerable as the rest of US. Unless she wasn't telling the truth. That's it. So all we have to do is figure out which one of the confessions is a lie. And we've got her. So why don't you investigate Wendy and avis, since you're all in Manhattan, and I'll take Teddy. You're forgetting two suspects. US? It's only fair. I'll send you a copy of my talk, and the name of the guy who wrote the original paper. You can find Caleb at the Westchester yoga center near my house, but investigate avis and Wendy first, because I'm innocent. Hi, my name's avis Monroe. I'm hoping you can help me. I stayed at wentworth last year, and I need to fill out some insurance forms, but I can't remember the exact dates of my stay. It's a-v-i-s m-o-n-r-o-e. If you could get back to me soon, I'd appreciate it. My number's 212... 555... 0162. Yes. Every day, I'm better and stronger. Bye. Come on, kids, put your shoes on! Gotta go! This whole thing makes me uncomfortable, asking for a prescription. What if Dr. Hohn discovers I'm your nanny? She won't, Rachel. It'll be fun. It'll be an adventure. Come on, kids, we gotta go! Robert stole my shoe! Give the shoe back, Robert. She stole my ball! [Cell phone rings] Hello? Give me my shoe! I'll just go up and change, and I'll call you from the train. Howard wants me to attend an art opening in the city tonight, so we'll have to reschedule. Two hours ago, I was cleaning banana and yogurt off the kitchen floor. Aren't you glad I took you away from that? Absolutely. So do you just want to mingle, or is there a target? Oh, there's a my partner's wife, over there. She co-owns the gallery. What a fabulous space, and I just adore the art! [Whispering]: That's why I like taking you to these things. It's all part of being Mrs. Howard winstead. I need to speak to Stuart. And I need a drink. Is it Emily or Wendy? I can never remember which is which. Emily. I'm sorry, but I don't... Avis's mother? How nice to see you, Mrs. Monroe. It's nice to see you, too, Wendy. Emily. Right, right... So how are you girls doi great. We had so much fun at the reunion. It must be wonderful having avis back in New York. Avis is in New York? Haven't you seen her? No. I had no idea she was in town. I hope I haven't ruined a surprise. The only surprise would be that she left Europe. When she moved away three years ago, she told US she was never coming across the ocean again. I thought she said she spent part of last year in Miami. I don't think so. I'll let you get your drink. It was lovely to see you, Wendy. Emily. And if you see my daughter again, please tell her I said... Hello. Who was that? Avis's mother. She said avis has been in Europe for the past three years, Howard. Three years! Cheers. [♪] Hello? Is someone there? Hello? Boo. [Screams] [Gasps] Javier, what are you doing here? I had to see you. I thought you were in Madrid. Not when you're in New York. The team has three days off between games, so I chartered a jet. The coach let you? I scored three goals last game. He owed me. How did you get in here? The housekeeper is a big soccer fan. You almost scared me to death. I am very, very... Very... Very sorry. You're bad. I would never stoop to snooping if I weren't certain this blackmail was Emily's idea of a joke. Have you ever done yoga before? A couple of years ago, I went to a spa resort, and they had classes every morning. Did you enjoy them? I never got up Hi! We'd like to sign up for the 2:00 class. Okay, are you in the system? No, this is our first time here. That's an advanced level class. Have you taken yoga before? Not really. Oh, yeah. If you're not sure, you might want to start with a beginner's class. We're interested in a specific yoga instructor. Caleb. Word has spread. Bet that's not all that's spread. If you think you can keep up, you're welcome to take it. 15 each, and that gives you access to the sauna. I got it. Thanks. [Cell phone rings] We don't allow electronic Dev seriously? Luddites! She really needs to stretch. When's this thing going to start? The guy's five minutes late. Relax. It's yoga. Afternoon, everyone. We'll start in sukhasana, and remember, this is your practice. Take child's pose whenever you need to, and don't forget to breathe. I wonder what she sees in him. We'll begin our internal journey and commence pranyama. What's that? Let your lungs expand and fill with air... Oh, breathing. I can do that. When you feel ready, move on to ujjayi pranyama, drawing the breath in from the base of your throat. Psst! He lost me. Don't complain. It's sitting and breathing. Yoga's not so hard. Keep your buttocks pointing to the sky while you press back with your hips. [Moaning] And don't forget to breathe. There. You feel the difference? Kind of. Okay, now relax your head, and push your feet to the ground. [Breathing deeply] Good. Except my hands are slipping. What's that? My hands are-- [screams] Crap! Ow! Namaste. Quick. Caleb is getting away. Caleb! Caleb! Yeah? My friend and I need to talk to you. And you are... I'm, uh... She's ima, and I'm Mia. Cute. Well, if you're looking for private lessons for the both of you... I'm definitely interested. Actually, we're here to talk to you about a friend of ours. Emily winstead? She said we should introduce ourselves. Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm not sure I know exactly which one she is. A lot of women take my class. She said you two know each other... Very well. Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it down. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't quite place her, but you should really keep at yoga. It'll help center you, and get rid of those saddle bags. I don't believe this. Me neither. I don't have saddlebags. About Emily. I mean, if Caleb doesn't know her, she must have lied, which means she's the blackmailer. He could have been denying it just to protect her. I just wish we knew. I mean, if Emily sent those letters, I'd wring her neck, but I'd feel bad if I killed her and she wasn't guilty. [Laughs] Let's take a sauna. Why is it so empty in here? Because Caleb's out there. Are women really that desperate? Yup. You and I were never boy-crazy. Not like Emily and avis. They were always screaming about boys. Or for boys. Or because of boys. [Laughs] What's so funny? The way Emily used to scream while with boys. I can't believe you don't remember. She used to wake US up every time she had a guy over. Oh, you mean that screaming. I wonder how she manages to keep her affairs secret with all the noise she makes at the crucial moment. It was like a crescendo, right? But with a tremble in it. Like... Like this... [Screaming] [Laughs] Nice work. Except the last part lasted longer and then tapered off more gradually. Like this... [Screaming] That you, Emily? Why'd you start without... Me. [Laughing] She was telling the truth! [♪] I have to fly back to Spain today. Will you come with me? I'd love to. Good. But I can't. There's something I have to take care of here. What? I really can't get into it. I'm sure we can find someone to take care of it, no? No. Besides, I don't want to burden you with my problems. Especially not now. Mine will be over soon. The judge says he will rule in the next two weeks. Is it looking good? My lawyer thinks I will get full visitation rights. Baby, that's great. [Squeals] For many reasons. It means I will have my divorce, I will get to see my daughter, and we will no longer need to keep this a secret. You know, I don't mind. You are embarrassed to be seen with me? Por favor. I would shout it to the world except for the paparazzi would beat me to it. But I bet they would pay a million for a photo of this. [Squeals] And this... And this, and this... [Laughing] Really? You think we could get a million? [Laughing] You have two new messages. First new message. [Beep] Hi, it's Ron, your boyfriend. Remember me? How about I come by tonight and give you a massage? I could start at your shoulders, and then move on down towards your back, and-- [beep] Second new message. [Beep] Hey, it's Emily. So guess what? Last night, I ran into avis's mother who told me avis has been in Europe for the past three years. That means avis is the blackmailer. I've been thinking about a motive, and do you remember how furious avis was senior year when Teddy got the biggest room? Call me so we can plan our revenge. Yeah, hey, em, I just got your message. Where are you? [Door buzzer] Wait, hold on, somebody's at my door. Hello? It's me, Emily. Let me in. I'm dying to talk to you. [Door lock buzzes open] With only four days before the drop-off, I couldn't wait anymore, so I came into the city, did a little shopping. Where have you been? Out. I've got to change my shirt. Can you believe that avis turned out to be such a liar? I think we should all confront her. I bet she'll break down and admit the whole thing. None of US'll ever speak to her again, of course, and we might want to spread the word that she's a blackmailer, maybe get something in the alumni magazine-- whoa, whoa, slow down, em. I mean, think about what you're saying. Remember avis the roommate? Who was never too busy to consult about an outfit, or proofread a paper, or go out for some ice cream and a good cry? I liked avis as much as you did, but clearly she's changed. She just tried to blackmail US out of $20,000 each-- no, she didn't. Yes, she did. No, she didn't! I called the I called the wentworth center and pretended I wa they called me back and confirmed that she was there for three months. In Miami? In Miami. But that's not true. Her mother said-- has it ever occurred to you that avis lied to her mother and not to US? When was the last time that avis saw her parents? Mrs. Monroe didn't even know she was in New York. And yet you believed her. I made a mistake. I-I jumped to conclusions. For god's sake, Emily! You were ready to destroy avis's life all because her batty mother has been out of touch with her. Frankly, I think you're over-reacting. I'm glad it isn't avis. I really am. [Sighs] You'll be happy to know you've been acquitted. Wendy and I met Caleb today. Wendy? Please don't tell me you brought Wendy into this. Yeah, why not? Because now that avis is in the clear, Wendy is my prime suspect. If she was lying about the insider trading, then she's the blackmailer. Carson, you might have ruined everything. Good, because I resign from this detective agency. It's not worth what it's doing to our friendships. The real friendships will be stronger when this is over, but fine. I'll catch the blackmailer myself, and when I do, I'll bet you another $20,000 that you'll thank me. Unless you're the one I'm looking for. Thanks for letting me crash here. I really appreciate it. I didn't feel like going home after fighting with I'm surprised I'm your first choice for a sleepover. With all that's going on, I'm afraid I'm not in the mood. How do you do it, em? I'm constantly surrounded by men, and they never ask me out. You're too controlled. You have to let them know you're available. I should tell Howard you said that, and if I don't, we all know there's someone who will. Yeah, and when Howard forgives me, we'll all go visit our favorite white-collar criminal in jail. Take that back. I'm not going to jail. It was just a joke. It's not funny. Sorry. Ma maybe it's time you went to bed. You've had a lot to drink. Maybe you're right. Aunt Laura's account, here we go... Where is that? Caliber petroleum. Caliber petroleum... You're not the blackmailer. [Gun cocking] Hold it right there. [Gasps] What are you doing? No, what are you doing? I was just checking to make sure you hadn't lied to US. You're a snoop. That's not loaded, is it? A single woman, living alone in New York? You bet it is. You're drunk. Why don't I count from 10? Please put it down. Ten, nine, eight... This is insane! Seven, six, five... Wendy, put the gun down! Three, two... Don't. One. Now, get out! Get out before I put bullets in this thing! One's asleep. The other is reading in bed. Thanks. Well, in other good news, my computer crashed five minutes ago. We should just buy a new one. We can't afford one. [Dryer buzzes] Want a cup of tea? How about a bowl of ice cream? You can't still be hungry after that huge dinner. You want to bet? How about I fix you up a nice piece of fruit? Are you kidding me? I work 10 hours at that cruddy job, and then I come home to bills and more work, and the one time I ask you to do a favor for me, you start attacking me about my weight? Whoa, attacking you? Teddy, look, I don't know what's bugging you, but I work hard at my job too, and I certainly felt that I did my fair share around here. There are things I have to deal with that you don't even know about. If there are, then tell me about them. Forget it. Just forget it. I'll get you some ice cream. I thought you were spending the night at Wendy's. Changed my mind. Is everything okay? Not really. Wendy totally flipped out on me. I think she's got too much stress at work. What did she do? I'm too tired to talk about it, Howard. Just go back to sleep, okay? Well, I want to know. It doesn't concern you. Well, of course not. I'm only your husband. I'm sorry, Howard... I've been so distracted lately. It's just... There's something's going on with my ex-roommates that's.... Upsetting. Can I do anything to help? Just go back to sleep. I'm sorry I woke you up. Is that you behind those shades, hartman? I had a rough night. Yeah, well, you see the paper this morning? The sec caught up with Collier and Montgomery. Charge charged them with nine counts of insider trading. No way. Big way. I bet you they end up doing time. Won't they just cut a deal? Government's saying no deal. They want to send a message to the community that corporate malfeasance will not be tolerated. So, you finish the market share report? Curran wants it yesterday. Almost, I just have to crunch some... Listen, Tom, I just need a few minutes, okay? Yeah. Yeah, sure. [♪] [Sighs] Excuse me, I'm looking for George watnick? Front reference desk. Right over there. This is kind of embarrassing. Um, see, I don't really know what George looks like. You met him online, right? Well, you hit the jackpot. He's a total hottie. Hi... Um, I'm Emily winstead, and yo and you're George watnick? I've heard a lot about you. You a graduate student? English. First year. You must not hang around the department much. I'd remember you. [Laughs] So, were you looking for me? Not you, a book. Ah... I called ahead and had them reserve it for me. Would you... Mind checking? Sure. It's under winstead, right? "Moby dick." One of my favorites. Did you study this with professor o'Connor? I took her graduate level 19th century lit course. She's one of the best teachers in the school, and I got an "a." Is that right? Guess what my final paper was about. How could I possibly? Sexual imagery in this book right here. I don't suppose you'd be up for a little private tutoring. I might. When do you get off? Work, I mean. At 2:00. How about I come by your place? Oh, no oh, no, not my place. I have three roommates. Actually, four, and they're really annoying. Okay, come by my place, then. My roommate will be teaching all afternoon. Just tell me where you want me. Right there. [Laughs] So just because poor Moby happens to be a sperm whale, we're supposed to read the entire thing as a sexual metaphor? Humpback whale would have worked, too. Now, I'm not saying it's the only way to read the book, but I would say it's the most fun. In fact, it's giving me all sorts of ideas. You know, I'm beginning to think all this talk of melville is just your way to seduce me. I mean I mean, you claim you got an "a" on this paper-- I did! Then prove it. What? I find good grades very exciting. Freaky, uh, but, yeah, no, if it gets you hot, I'll find it. Have you read the latest "granta"? Uh, no, not yet. It has this killer essay on the bull metaphor in Hemingway. Cool. Who wrote it? Me. Ah, I found the paper. Professor o'Connor's comments are on the last page. "Brilliant analysis, "original thinking, and a fun read! A." Professor o'Connor really flipped for this, huh? Are you satisfied? Yes. I'm not. You have a great body. Thanks. I do a lot of yoga. May I? You obviously work out a lot, too. What do you do, weights? Swimming? I quote. From Andrew marvell's "to his coy mistress." [Laughs] "Had we but world enough and time, this coyness, lady, were no crime, we would sit down and think which way to walk and pass our long love's day." Hey, hey! Carson! What are you doing here? What was going on in there? In where? You know. What have you been, spying on me? No more than you've been spying on me. What did George say to you? I have every right to know. Relax, you're in the clear. I saw the paper with your writing on it. Your story checks out. You're not the blackmailer. Why were you in there so long? My god, Emily! You di how could you? I couldn't. We only went to second base. Well, second and a half, but I didn't go all the way. What stopped you? I don't know. George is young, he's hot, he recites poetry, but once we started messing around, it just felt wrong. Well, maybe because it is. [Sighs] Listen... Now that we both know the other is innocent, can we be friends again? 'Cause I could really use a friend right now. Something's bothering me. Having to cough up 20 grand? Actually, no. It's Howard. Aw, poor Howard. See? You sympathize with him immediately, and that's the problem. I'm starting to feel sorry for him too. Maybe you should also feel a little worried. What, because of the blackmailer? Don't be silly. Howard loves me so much. He'll forgive me. Maybe he loves you so much, he won't. It happens. It's got to be Teddy, you know. We've eliminated everyone else. Teddy? She's hardly the most adventuresome of the bunch. No, but she's the most needy. It's too bad, too. Since Teddy moved to Westchester, we've really gotten close. You don't know for sure that she lied, do you? No. I'll find out tomorrow. And just supposing that she didn't? The drop-off's soon. Well, then, plan b. Which is? I don't know. We pay the money? I might not. I don't have a choice. You may not either. Think about it, em, you may be risking your marriage for $20,000. I would like to take care of miss Monroe's bill. No, Javi, it's too much. You stay as long as you want, but remember, the sooner you return to Europe, th the happier I will be. Well, I promise to join you soon. In a week? In less than a week. Then I will miss you for less than a week. Wait, no, we shouldn't. What if somebody sees US? Of course. Well, it was nice seeing you, miss Monroe. I have a better idea. [♪] Now, give me a proper goodbye. Ron, why are you sitting in the dark? Oh, I was just waiting for you. I didn't know how dark it had become. Did we have plans for tonight? Not officially, but I brought over some pizza. I'm not hungry, Ron. So, um, where were you? With a friend. Whom? Emily winstead. So, what's she up to? [Sighs] Nothing special. No kiss? Nope. Well, don't spare my feelings. Feel free to reject me bluntly. Gee, Ron, I feel terrible that I can't be incredibly warm and loving right now because I'm so tired that all I want is to be alone, and instead, I find you here, uninvited and resentful. I'm resentful? Well, maybe I am. You know, a guy does get resentful when his very presence is a burden to the woman who's supposed to love him. When they're no closer after seven years than they were after two. When-- just shut it, will you? I have had a terrible week, one of my worst ever. Why don't you tell me about it? Look, I'm not expecting you to be all bubbly and cheerful. Just don't exclude me. Obviously, it is not something that I want to share with you. My god, Carson! Is there anything you do want to share with me? [Sighs] I'll tell you what, Ron. Tomorrow, I'll be loving. We'll go to dinner somewhere nice and not too expensive, and then I will be as sweet as can be, but not tonight. I've never asked you for much, but I think I need you to be loving right now. You're not the only one who's had a rough week. I'm sorry. I can't. I'm about ready to give up. [Sighs] Won't stop you. No. You won't. I've had enough. You're quiet tonight. That's a change. I told you something's been distracting me lately. We can skip this dinner if you want. No, i'm... I'll be fine. I wish you'd tell me I swore I wouldn't tell anyone. See, I have this friend. Who? Doesn't matter. Anyway, her husband found out that she was having an affair-- it's Stacy, isn't it? No, it's not Stacy. So her husband got really furious and threatened-- Amy? No! It really doesn't matter who it is. Anyway, her husband threw her out of the house and changed the locks-- come on, em, tell me who it is. No! It's your sister, isn't it? That's why you won't tell me. No! No, it's not my sister, for god's sake! It's... Teddy. Teddy? Teddy. She's the last person I'd think would... I mean, I'd expect you to have an affair before Teddy. [Laughing] Me have an affair? I wouldn't, but since you brought it up, what if I did? You'd forgive me, wouldn't you? I'd like to think I'd be big enough, but I'm not sure. Let's not put it to the test, okay? [♪] Can you check on that again, Barry? Well, are you sure that's all that's in the account? What a what about the bonds? Oh, that's right, we did. Look, I just need another 20 grand. There's got to be something we can do. Let me get back to you on that, Barry. It's just not what I'm looking for. Thanks for showing it to me. Thanks, Harvey. You can take me home now. Don't be too obvious about it, and don't let Dr. Hohn know what you do for a living. If she asks, just tell her you're an accountant. Oh, I'd rather be an architect. Fine, you're an architect. Don't get carried away and start giving advice on renovations. Are you ready? I think so. Okay, now, if Dr. Hohn bites, come right out and tell me. If she doesn't, stay there and finish the exam. Now we wait patiently. I'm bored. Me too. Oh, come here, sweetie. An architect. How interesting. Residential or commercial? Both. What can I do for you? It's the strangest thing. I've been breaking out in a rash lately. Okay, where on your body does the rash occur? On my chest, mostly, and on my arms, and... My cheek a little bit. Okay, have you noticed any connection between the outbreaks? Something you might be allergic to. Food, detergent, a type of clothing? The only connection is I've been under a lot of stress lately. Do you think could the rash could be a nervous reaction? It's possible. I might want to try some other tests first, though. Oh, I'm not sure that's necessary. See, I think if I stopped being so nervous, the rash would disappear completely, so what I really need is something to soothe my anxiety. Something a bit stronger than chamomile tea. She did it. You got the prescription? It's only for 10 pills, and Dr. Hohn wants to see me in three months. That's great. I am so relieved. What are you doing here? I should have known you wouldn't lie, Teddy. I mean, I did know, I really I did, but now I'm sure. Oh, I have a feeling this isn't a coincidence. That woman I just saw was a test, wasn't she? That's our new nanny, Rachel. Isn't she fabulous? Oh, I feel sick. Teddy, it was for your own good. See, I figured if I could prove one of US was lying, then that person had to be the blackmailer, except now it looks like we were all telling the truth, which means... We're right back where we started. You don't have to get so angry. Do you have any idea what it's like doing what I just did? Knowing I could lose my license? I stopped doing this, I sw I only did it again because I need the money to pay the blackmailer. You may not have to. I'm still hoping to find out who the blackmailer is. The drop-off is tonight. I know. Did you even raise $20,000, or were you so sure you'd solve the mystery that you haven't even bothered? I raised it. Where'd you get it from? I have a trust fund from my parents. Howard will never know I took the money. I remember that trust fund. It's the one I used to wish for back in college when I had to clean toilets to pay for my books, and you didn't have to lift a finger. We gave you the biggest room! Emily... Maybe you could help me out. Could you lend me $5,000? I promise I will pay you back. Teddy, I don't know what to say. You know I'm good for it. Of course I do, and I would love to help you. It's just something my mother always used to say, "lend money, and you'll lose friends?" And I'd hate to make things awkward between US. [Chuckles] We wouldn't want that, would we? Forget I asked. I'll figure something out. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sure. Well, you coming down saved me a call. Wendy wanted me to tell you we're meeting tonight at the Madison bar at 7:45 for the hand-off. Why didn't she tell me herself? Because she never wants to speak to you again. Come on, sweetie, gotta go. Mommy's in a hurry. Got a lot of thinking to do before 7:45. I need this more than you do. Hi. Hi. Got home early from work tonight. What are you working on? Nothing. [Muttering] I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. I said, I'm not as smart as I thought I was. Care to tell me what's brought on this unusual self-deprecation? Life. What time is it? Just past 6:00. Oh, shoot. I got to run. You're going out? Believe me, Howard, there's nothing I would ra than stay ho but I have to meet my old roommates in Manhattan tonight for a drink. What time are you going to be back? Oh... I'm not sure. I'll call you when I know? What's in the bag? It's just a present for one of the girls. Looking for someone? I'm meeting some friends, but I seem to be the first. Can I set you up? Uh, yeah, just a sparkling water. Thanks. And a scotch. On the rocks? Uh, neat. Can you make that a double? [Sighs] Late, as always. I hit some traffic coming in. Which way did you come? I took the hutch to the westside highway. Why would you go that way? Thinking that it would be-- who cares? Can we just give the bartender the cash and go? Ugh, this makes me sick. And by the way, what is to stop the blackmailer from asking for more? Well, i'm all tapped out, so this is it. We'll just have to hope whoever's doing this isn't too greedy. I have one last idea. Oh, what's that, Nancy drew? We should count the money. If one of US hasn't really brought any, it's because she's the blackmailer and knew it wouldn't be necessary. Well, why don't we ask those nice gentlemen over there to help US count $100,000? Follow me. Everyone take out your cash. Mine's in 20 bundles of ten $100 bills. Mine's in 50s. Mine's in 20s. Mine's in hundreds. Mine's not quite so neat. Teddy... I really had to scrounge to get all this. I say we go through all the bills to make sure nobody's got fake money stuffed in there. Can't we just speed this up? All this money is making me nervous. All this money makes me hot. Really? Is that why you engineered this whole event? I didn't, but you should know that, because I'm pretty sure you're the one who did. Wendy! What are you doing? You deserve this. Oh, let them. Stop it! Fighting in the girls' room? What is this, 8th grade? Can we please just get this over with so we can forget this whole thing ever happened? As if we ever will. Hand me your cash, Teddy. While I'm counting this, Carson, you count Emily's. Emily, you count avis's. Teddy, you count Carson's... And avis, you count mine. 200, 250, 300, 350... 400, 500, 600, 700... 20, 40, 60, 80. 20, 40, 60... 800, 900, 1,000... 76, 77, 78... 98, 103, 113, 133, [toilet flushing] [Emily]: That was me, not the money. I had to go. One, two... It's all here. I'm willing to donate my bag to the cause. Does anyone want to say a few words, or something? Somebody should put a painful curse on the bag and whoever takes it. Yeah, good idea. Carson, you must know a good shakespearean curse. [Sighs] Whoever takes this money shall walk the earth wretched and friendless. [Zip] Consider it cursed. So, what now? We can all stand around and look at each other suspiciously. Or we could go someplace for one last chance to figure out who's doing this. My place is closest. Let's do it. Why not? Teddy? I guess. Avis, you in? I'm in. So, is anyone planning anything special in the near future? Well, I should be working my butt off trying to pay back the money. And I'll be working my butt off for no good reason at all. What about you, avis? I'll probably go back to Europe. You kn you know, same old, same old. That's right. You like to have things the same. Like wearing your grandmother's ring? Never taking it off your finger? Where's the ring now? What? I... I took it off to have it cleaned. I'm having my ring cleaned. Oh, my god, your breath smells like liquor. Okay, I had a drink, but it was just one drink. So you're not sober? I am. I just I just... With the stress of all this--- you know, she hasn't spoken to her family in years. They don't support you anymore, do they, avis? So the rich socialite act was just a put-on? Showin showing up with champagne, and staying in fancy hotels, it's all a lie? Okay, you guys, come on. My parents did cut me off a few years ago to try to force me to get a job. That's why you needed our money. What? I am not the blackmailer. Look, I sold the ring to get cash. Then why did you lie to US about getting your ring cleaned? I didn't do it, I swear-- you knew that we would check to make sure that everyone brought the right amount, right? So maybe you did sell the ring in order to get the money. And tomorrow, when you have 100,000 in your greedy little hand, you'll buy it back, won't you, avis? Won't you? Avis, did you do that? What were you thinking, avis? [Angry voices overlap] Hey... What did the doctor say? Avis is anemic and dehydrated. They have her on a saline drip with an iron supplement. Her blood alcohol level is very low, .02, but clearly, her body had a bad reaction to metabolizing it. So she did break the detox. Combined with the stress we put on her... She'll be fine. Her mother's in with her now. Mrs. Monroe hadn't seen her in four years, and had no idea what was going on. So has avis been entirely alone this whole time? We don't know. She was calling out for a "Javier." Her mom's going to try tracking him down. Honestly honestly, I feel more sorry for her than angry. Well, I hate to bring this all back down to a mercenary level, but does this mean we're going to get our money back? I called the bar to tell them to hold onto the bag. The manager said it had already been picked up, and refused to give details. She must have owed a lot of people a lot of money to have kept up that lifestyle. Maybe we should go through her address book. Still playing Sherlock Holmes? No. I'm done. I'm going home. Me too. I'll walk out with you. I'm in the north structure. I'm in the south. I'm going to head to the vending machine and get a cup of coffee. Do you want something, Wendy? No, I got to head back to work. In the middle of the night? Yeah. I'm way behind. [♪] [♪] Emily, over here. Where have you been? You didn't get my message? The one that said you were going to be very late and not to worry? Well, I worried. You shouldn't have. What the hell is going on? Howard, I was at the hospital. Avis had a nervous breakdown. It was so scary, and horrible, and kind of our fault. Well, what happened? I can't tell you. Emily, you have to. Oh, god. I just paid $20,000 so you wouldn't find out about this. [♪] How could you do this? You must have known how it much it would hurt me. Honestly, I wasn't thinking about that. What were you thinking? That my 10th reunion was coming up, and all my roommates have these great careers, and I've just been popping out babies and being Mrs. Howard winstead. I remembered that feeling when I was in college, and the whole world was full of possibilities, and you could do and be anything you wanted, and I just wanted to feel that way again. So when this yoga guy came onto me, I went for it. Because you had feelings for him? Because he thought I was 26, and for the hour that we were together, Howard, I felt young again. And that was worth risking our marriage? No-- and everything we have together? No! You're damn right! I deserve better than this, Emily. You do, I know, and Howard, I realize now that I wouldn't trade places with any of my roommates for anything. I made a choice, and it was the right one for me. You and the kids... You're my whole life. Is it over between you and this yoga guy? Completely. And how do I know it won't happen again? Your 15th is five years away. I'll work hard to make this right, Howard. I'll go to therapy, or we could go together. If you want to have an affair to even things up, you could. And you think I should do that? No. I'd hate that. I'd be so afraid that you'd leave me, and now I know the possibility of losing you is... It's the scariest thing in the world to me. I need you so much, Howard. I need you too. [Emily screaming] Oh, Howard. Happy birthday, Carson. Oh, thank you, Hannah. Did they fix the copy machine, by any chance? Not yet. And that's all I wanted for my birthday. There's a student waiting to see you. Let them know I'll be in my office. [Sighs] Whoever takes this money shall walk the earth wretched and friendless. Freeze, police! [Laughing] You should see how guilty you look. Is that it? Every penny, you bastard. No one told you to plagiarize my paper. $100,000. I didn't think you I don't. You know what an associate professor makes. Why do you think I want a cushion to tide me through the dark years ahead? I think I'm going to start with a Hawaiian vacation. May you rot in the sun. I'll do my best. Whoa, how stupid do you think I am? We had a deal. The money for the paper. [Knock] Sorry to disturb you. Just wanted to make sure you found your bag. The messenger dropped it off this morning. Yes, thank you, Hannah. Also, you'll be happy to know the copy machine repairman is here. Thank you, Hannah. Now, where's the paper? I'll send it to you. No paper, no money. I didn't bring it with me. Then run home and get it. Just give me the money! No. Give it. Give it. Looking for this? [Gasps] Where did you get that? I took it out of your apartment. I figured PR I figured professor o'Connor might want it for her birthday. I had no idea it was such an expensive gift. Wait, you two are friends? We were. Look, Emily, I can explain-- yeah, you don't need to. Your door wasn't quite closed. En let me explain. The bitch stole my paper. She owes me. The bitch may owe you, but she's paying with my money, and a few others chipped in as well. Generous. Generosity had nothing to do with it. But now that you have the proof, he can't blackmail me anymore, and we can all get our money back. I have a better idea, Emily. Hawaii sounded a little lonely. You could come with me. Emily, you can't. We could have fun. Finish what we started. That is a very interesting idea, George. Let me think about it. See, Carson, this is another reason why I'm angry with you. I had quit smoking, but with all this stress... Emily, what are you doing? Oh, yes! Oops. I'm going to the Dean. Then I'm going to the police. You're both crazy. Whoo-hoo! That was brilliant! Believe it or not, it wasn't the most important thing on my mind at the time. I know that you hate me now, but you have to believe that when George came to me with his demands, I had zero options, and then you started making US all tell secrets at the reunion-- you didn't arrive planning this? No! I was going to wait until after that weekend and resign. I was desperate. Why did you let it go so far? Because I didn't think it would ruin anyone's life. The four of you seemed to have everything. Husbands, kids, money. I was about to lose the one thing that mattered to me. What you did was wrong. We all did something wrong. That's how this whole thing began. That's different! You betrayed your best friends! And you betrayed Howard, and avis betrayed her mother, and Teddy betrayed her patients. Life is full of betrayals. And maybe it's good that... Some of these things are out in the open now. In the hospital, I saw Mrs. Monroe and avis, and I thought, "this brought them back together." That's... a positive, right? How you can say this is a positive when our friendships have been destroyed? It's my birthday, and normally everybody would have checked in with phone calls and emails, but you're the only one who showed up. I better call the others... And explain what happened. Hold on. Maybe there's another way. What? The others will never forgive you if they thought that you were actually going to take their money for real, but what if we called them and we told them that it was all a practical joke. They would never believe I'd do that. I know, but they'd believe I would. Are you serious? I'll just... Say I was having serious marriage problems, and... The blackmail was a way to distract myself. Do you think they'll buy it? Me being a selfish bitch? I'm thinking yes. I love you! Oh, and Teddy, Wendy, and avis will hate you. Then you'll just have to convince them not to. [Telephone rings] Hartman here. I'm busy, Emily. I'll have to get back to you. What, are you kidding? Um, it's a long story, Wendy, but the short version is that I started the blackmail as a joke, and then I-I didn't know how to stop it. [Screaming in fury] Okay, you. Let me talk to her. Yeah. All right. Wendy, Wendy, it's Carson. I'm here with Emily, and she feels terrible about what happened. I know she should, but she's going through a really tough time at home, and... and... She's just going to have to find a way to make it up to US, but if I can forgive her, can't you forgive her? ♪ And I know now ♪ ♪ what really matters most ♪ ♪ I know now ♪ ♪ what really matters most ♪ ♪ the child waving ♪ ♪ who turned into a ghost ♪ ♪ the boy who took ♪ ♪ a bus down the west coast ♪ ♪ for love ♪ ♪ for love ♪ ♪ for love... ♪
