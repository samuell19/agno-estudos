Now, Dwight, now you tell me. You got anything special planned for next week? Well, Chuck, I'm fixing to head out of L.A. for a few days. If that's possible, the way the freeways are right now. Well, anyhow, I'm fixing to head out... Horses seem a little wound up today. Well... The damn water, most likely. Gus, how many times we been through this? Hell, I just help build them. I don't like them either. But they didn't screw up your water. Well... I guess this is the last I'm gonna hear of it, though. We're fixing to head home tomorrow. Oh. Well, it figures. Most everybody's leaving L.A. You tell that big-shot friend of yours, just because he sent me an invite to his party that don't make him a neighbour. Hey, y'all quit! Hey, come on, I said, quit! She started it. He said my fancy dress made me look like a butt end of a bull. Josh, did you say that? I don't know what I'm gonna do with you kids. We're fixing to drive back home. Y'all better shape up. Go on, apologise. You ain't that bad. I've heard better. You're gonna be the pride of the party. Now you say it. Honey, you already know what I think. Hot diggity dog. Did you feel that one, folks? Don't even ask me what that one was on the Richter scale because I just don't care anymore. They're all bad. Yep, Caltech says that makes it 10,000 aftershocks since the Northridge nasty. There ought to be some sort of reward for going through that many shakes. But I guess that reward is just living here in sunny California. So settle back in the saddle, folks, and enjoy the ride. Please. Please. I got a family. Oh! I got a rhyme. This little piggy went to prison. And these little piggies stayed home. Please. So... this little piggy... Excuse me! Mr. Nelson! That's bullshit. No, I'm telling you, it's bullshit! I'm paying for security, all right? Mr. Nelson? Randall? Have you seen Jack Coleman? He's out on the Chisholm Trail. What the fuck do I know, all right? I thought you were planning on being a human being today. I was. Okay, I'll call you back. Jose, not the Impala, el Mustang. This makes me look like a gang member, okay? Hey, guys! Hey, have any of you guys seen the site manager? Who? Jack Coleman. I haven't seen him all day. Nowhere? Sorry, man. Mr. Coleman! Mr. Coleman! How you doing, Bobby? Not too good, sir. Hi, Bobby. Come on, kids. Hi, kids. You got that look in your eyes. You know, I punched out at noon today. I know, sir, but this is a problem. I mean, this is heavy. Heavy. Kids, go on and get washed up. I'm sorry. Mm-hmm. Go on now. Give it back, Josh! Josh, give it back. Give it back. Josh! Hey, Bobby. Hey, Gus. Hi, Jack. You all right? You gotta take a look at these regulators. Everything was fine this morning. Then the aftershock hit. And with you leaving and all, I don't know what we should do. Just don't tell anyone. Really? I mean, okay, but... My lips are sealed. Bobby, you're just dumber than dirt. Jack, arrest that man. Go back, Gus. Yeah, fuck you, Gus. Damn. Those gas regulators, it's a serious problem. You know, Jack, I just can't believe that you wanna go now. Randall, don't start. "Don't start." Jack, did you see this? Did you see this? What? Centaur's safe-room codes for all the houses on the block. Now, these are fucking ex-cops. What do they program? Rudolph and Santa's fucking reindeer. Listen, Randall, sooner or later those regulators are gonna blow. Yeah, yeah. Come here. Look. Now... they said it's user-friendly. It works. Mm-hmm. The regulators, it's a serious problem. You know where I'm at, don't you? You, you're gonna be out, what, under the stars, roasting hot dogs and all that happy shit. Me, I gotta unload these fucking houses. You... You're walking out on me. My job here's finished, Randall. And I ain't walking. I'm running. Yeah. Well... fuck you too. You will order those regulators now, right? Okay, you know, will you look at that? I mean, that shit's gotta last through the party. You think I got enough? Three strikes, and you're out. Come here, Butchie. Let me deputise you. --Los Angeles County... I hereby declare you a Johnny Law. What they done to you inside, Butchie, huh? Zapped your strength? Come on, Butch. Come on, Butch. Come on, Coug. Police are still searching for clues in the brutal, double homicide of two sheriff's deputies earlier today. The deputies were transporting Benjamin Jones to L.A.'s maximum-security prison near Santa Clarita. Jones had recently been sentenced to life without parole under California's strict new three-strikes and you're out provision, for his part in a series of brutal home invasions that have terrorised L.A. Jones is missing and considered armed and extremely dangerous. You got mentioned on the radio, Butchie. That's fucking cool. You're a fucking stud! Now you're gonna be a fucking king, my friend. Leave him alone, man. We gotta get this guy a woman. It's party time. Hi. I think it's like "Xanydu." Good. Highland Glen, I am loving it. And, Randall, I am loving you. Ho, ho, ho! I am gonna be rich. It's the kind of place where you might see Zsa Zsa borrowing a cup of sugar from Merv. It's sumptuous, yet real. Tell me you love me, baby. The place I would love to bring you. Say hi to Randall. I'm Boot. This is Josh. Our dad built this whole place, and he says we're gonna-- Randall, another party video? Would you look at me in person, not through the camera? Hey! Hey, kids. Hey, Jack. A wasted Santa. What a gyp. Josh. Hey, look what I got for you guys. Awesome. Josh, why don't you take Boot near the bandstand and fill up on some stocking stuffers, okay. We got teddy bears and candy canes and stick-on tattoos. All right? You have fun. Go on. Anything you want. Damn, I wish I had your touch. It's called bribery. Well, you should think about getting some of your own. What, stocking stuffers? Kids. Oh, please. You know Randall and I have agreed to an alternative relationship. "Alternative." You two are living together, aren't you? So, what do you guys do down there in Texas, anyhow? Well, you know, chew tobacco, spit, whup each other's ass at cowboy poetry. We're gonna miss you, Jack. It's time. It's been 16 months now since the kids' mom passed away. It's time to go back home. And it's Christmas. They're excited. I hear you guys are camping out at the Colonial tonight. Yeah, we're out of the apartment, so... Are you looking forward to it? Camping out? No. Going home. Hey, come here. I want you to meet some people. Come on. Now, you can't get this entertainment in Texas, am I right? Hey! Eight homes. I bought one... you lucky guys get to sell the rest. Highland Glen. Eight of the greatest homes in L.A. County, the state-of-the-art gated community for the 21st century. You're never gonna have such a hot listing ever again. Now... breathe in. Relax. You can smell roses, not smog. You're 40 minutes from downtown L.A. The sky is blue, not brown. And the money is green! Highland Glen! It's about decency. It's about community. It's about clean living and American values. So which one of you guys is paying? We all pay in the end, sweetheart. Hey, little sister. Star. Hey, Cinderella. We're on our way to the ball. All right. All right. Okay, now, folks. I want you to meet the man who really built this place. My site manager, Jack Coleman. Jack here used to be a marshal. And I tell you, he really laid the law down around here. And he got this job finished on time. He did an amazing job. I mean it. I couldn't have done it without you, buddy. Now why don't we get him son up here. What do you say? Jack! Come on, Jack! Come on up here! Don't make me look bad. Come on up here. What do you say, huh? For the marshal. You should know better. Come on. Do it for me. Don't make me look bad. I'm gonna miss you. Thanks. Look out. All right! Now, get out of here! Let's have some fun. Come on! What are you putting in there? You're putting nothing but candy in there. There's a telephone. Yeah, but it's got candy in it. Bubble gum. Candy. Bubble gum. Daddy... why can't we go to Yellowstone on the way home? I wanna see Old Faithful. Because it's covered with snow and the bears will eat you. I like snow. Lilly let me play in hers all day. She's nice. But Randall's kind of weird. Yeah. Okay. Well... Here's Johnny. His name's Nate. Well, it's time for everyone named Nate and Boot to go to sleep. Okay. Good night, Daddy. Good night. Give me some sugar. Josh? Hello? Hello. Jesus! Shit. I'm sorry. My fault. I didn't think nobody was home, man. I thought it was one of those crank calls, you know. Man, you scared my ass. Sorry. Look, this is a nice neighbourhood, man. I mean, this is as close as you're gonna get to heaven on earth. You know what I'm saying? What you got living in there? What some sheiks or something? Bill. Right. That's gonna be $50. I mean 15. Fifty is my next call. I got it confused. Sorry about that. Keep the change. Oh, thanks, sir. Here. Here. You want me to carry it in for you? No. Oh, okay. Thanks. Good night. Merry Christmas! Yeah, lookit here. Boy, I'll tell you, why can't I live here? Josh, pizza's here. Josh? Josh! Put down that gun! Do you wanna go and get yourself--? Do you wanna get yourself killed? Do you wanna get yourself killed?! I'm sorry, little man. It's just that if anything ever happened to you and Boot I'd... It ain't easy. I know that. She never came back. Josh-- She said she was only going to town. She said she'd be right back. It was a car accident, Josh. There was nothing anybody could do. And it wasn't fair. I know you have every right to be angry. Angry at the world, angry at everything. But you know something, Josh? That anger's gonna hold you down. You gotta move on. We gotta move on. We still got each other, Josh. We could build on that. But, you know... a guy can never build anything alone. And I ain't worried. Because I figure between you and Boot, I got the best crew a guy could ever have. You ever gonna be a marshal again? I don't know, Josh. I don't know. For chrissake, Cougar, what's taking him so long? Butchie's been inside a long time, Monk. I say we just let him take his time. What do you think? A thousand points of light. That's America. Just a lot of fucking light bulbs. Oh, fuck. All right. There ain't nothing I can do, honey. It happens. Hey, it's them drugs, probably. That stuff can eat you up. You're not going back out there, you hear me? Down. You want a hard-on? Daddy! Daddy! Dad, where are you?! I'm here. Come on! Daddy, help me! Daddy, I'm scared! Come on! Come on! Daddy, I'm scared!

You know, people like you always think that people like me are looking for something. No. Yes. You're right. I say: "Don't look, and ye shall find." Like Buddha. Couldn't I be just some guy who came up here to just see how you were doing? Real mess out there, or haven't you heard? Real fucked up. Okay, samurai. I'll make you a deal. First one to the gun.
