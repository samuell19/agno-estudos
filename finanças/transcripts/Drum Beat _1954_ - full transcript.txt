Is, uh, President Grant in? Yeah. You servin' him? Yup. Not very talkative, are you? No. Lose your leg in the rebellion? Yup. Lost my leg at Shiloh. You might almost say I already got one foot in the grave. Catch on, one foot. Any rigmarole getting into the White House to see the President? No, walk in and tell him you wanna talk to the general. All there is to it. - Thanks. - Yup. Just walk right in. May we help you? Y-y-yes, sir, I.. ...have a letter from the President. I think the general is just finishing his supper. I'll tell him you're here. Have a seat. Oh, thank you, sir. Aiming to shoot the President? Are you crazy? Oh, just wonderin'. Gun, knife. Just showin' off, huh? No, sir. Have you met the President? What's he like? Plain as a mud fence. Smokes like a chimney and.. ...drinks now and then too. I'd say he fits better in some tent than...this place. What are you, a missionary? Me? You don't act like you like our President? You're wrong there, son. I'm his father. - Hello, pa. - Hello, son. - Johnny MacKay? - Yes, sir. You've wasted no time. The railroad, sir. It only took 10 days. Why are you sitting out here, pa? Why don't you come on in to dinner? No, not with old Doc Thomas and their spoutin' about all the poor Injun. All Dr. Thomas wants is fair treatment for the Indians.. ...and so do I. Join us for coffee. Hm, it will be interesting.. ...having you and the doctor meet. Better unhitch your scalping knife, son. 'While in Oregon and California' they've actually signed petitions demanding that Indian fighters be sent into the area. 'To kill Indians, wherever they may be found.' Ladies.. ...I have beside me the best Indian fighter in the State of Oregon. Mrs. Grant, may I present Johnny MacKay. - How do you do, Mr. MacKay? - Hi, there, ma'am. This is our daughter, Nellie. Have you actually seen redskins bite the dust? They really don't bite it, miss. They hit it. Miss Nancy, meet, Mr. MacKay. I know exactly how Nellie feels, Mr. MacKay. You look just as wild and willy 'as an eastern girl could wish for.' Thank you, ma'am. I wouldn't want to disappoint a lady. I know how you feel. I'm afraid I've disappointed thousands by not looking like a general. This eastern girl is about to become a Westerner. She maybe under your protection for a while. Dr. Thomas.. ...you've been condemning Indian fighters to eternal damnation. Meet the best. Have you blood on your hands? Uh, would you like some coffee, Mr. MacKay? No, ma'am. Thank you. Won't you sit down, Mr. MacKay? Uh, no, thank you, sir. Well, Mackay. I wanna know about the Modoc trouble and their leader, Captain Jack. Boils down, Mr. President, that Captain Jack wants all of Lost River. What kind of a man is he? Well, some people say he's got a little white blood in him because of his light eyes. But I think it's mostly bad blood. I am told the only possible way to peace out there is to get Captain Jack and his associates back into the reservation with the friendly Modocs.. ...to live up to his treaty. That's the settlers side. What about the Modocs side of it? Captain Jack said he never read that treaty. But he's lying, Mr. President. Would you call him a liar to his face? I have. Why, I have letters from white men praising him to the skies! Sure, he got them Indian wives. They wrote nice letters about him. When he was in trouble, he took the letters to the justice of the pe-- That shouldn't affect justice. It doesn't. But he also got the Justice Of Peace an Indian wife. Has he offered you an Indian wife? - Yes, ma'am. - Are you married to one? No, ma'am. Do you have scruples against it? Have I got what? Are you opposed to intermarriage? No, ma'am, I...I intend to get married someday. I mean, is marrying Indian women the accepted thing out there? Well, yes, ma'am, there isn't enough white women to go around. It's, uh, time to go to bed, Nellie. But I'm not sayin' anything, mother. - I'm just listening. - I know. She's learning history at first hand, Julia. Do you think Captain Jack's Modocs can be moved back to the reservation by peaceable means? MacDyar, Applegate, and Huntington tried it, sir. And failed, I know. I get reports now, the settlers.. ...want peace with rifles. It's getting so the settlers are much harder to handle than the Indians. When your folks are killed, you shoot back. Have you killed Indians? Quiet a few. Now, you must go to bed, Nellie. 'You'll have bad dreams tonight.' I like bad dreams. I like being scared. Go to bed, Nellie. Goodnight, grandfather. Don't you feel like a murderer? - No, sir. - Shouldn't you. I've never shot anybody without cause. My job is to protect the wagon train. When somebody shoots at my people, I shoot back. Right back at 'em, wham! And I bet he was a crack shot too. I am very curious, young man, as to what kind of a family you come from? Pioneers. Do they approve of your occupation? I never asked them, ma'am. I don't wonder. Where are they now? Buried at Bloody Point. Bloody Point. They were massacred? - Yes, ma'am. - Your whole family? My mother and father and.. ...kid brother was scalped and mutilated. My two sisters, 12 and 14. They weren't killed right away. They were captured. They didn't last long. The Indian women got jealous and stoned them to death. Maybe my folks wouldn't have approved of me becoming an Indian fighter. I never had the chance to ask them. I suppose you wonder why I sent for you? I was educated as a soldier. So I know a fighter knows best the meaning of peace. I want to lay aside your rifle and bring peace to the Modoc country. Get Captain Jack and his Modocs back on the reservation? That's the only avenue to peace, isn't it? - Without guns? - If humanly possible. Will you try? Well, I didn't come 3000 miles to say.. ...no to my president. Then you'll do it? - I'll try the best I can, sir. - That's all I ask. Thank you...and I wish you good luck, in the venture. Your chief is sure gonna get a laugh out of this. John MacKay, peace commissioner. Wait till Captain Jack hears that. Johnny is a good man. Maybe he get peace. He'll get what Jack wants to give him. No more, no less. Hello, there, Boddy. Have Modocs been giving you any trouble down at Lost River? Oh, missing a few horses now and then. Some nights they hoof and holler. You let Captain Jack buffalo you and the first thing you know, he's gonna take your whole farm. Oh, no, he won't. I put too much sweat in it. I'll fight for my farm. Mr. Satterwhite, Miller wants to know if you'll put this letter 'on the Union Pacific for Ohio?' Out of the way Injuns. Get away from that door, you yellow leopard coyote. What you do about it? I'll bash your head in. Modoc Jim says he just wants to see how thick your door is, Bill. What business is that of his? Well, he says the last time he fired at you the arrow didn't go through it. 'He says next time he's gonna use a heavier bow.' Take your stinkin' fingers off that door! No, no, Bill, don't pull that trigger. Remember, these are Captain Jack's men. Michael. Who's man are you? 'All aboard and get up.' Ho! Ya-hee! Ya-ha! I see brass buttons comin'. Captain Jack, you don't need to worry about brass buttons or Johnny MacKay no more. The soldiers know this yet? I'm on my way to deliver the message to the agency. Now, I thought I'd let you know first. Hello, there, Crackel. Any telegraph message from my Niece Nancy? Yup. Arrives Sacramento, Friday. Same train with our new Peace Commissioner Johnny MacKay. Oh, so that's what the President wanted to see Johnny about. Johnny'll treat you right, Jack. You can trust him. Why you wear soldier suit. You fight again maybe? No, I've been up to Fort Klamath. They just got around to giving me these medals. You farmer now. What do you want with them medals? You sell to me. Once you earn these things you don't sell 'em. Why? You need woman? No, thanks, I'm perfectly satisfied with Mrs. Meek. Maybe you better sell me the medals. - No, thanks. - I think maybe you better. I think maybe you better stop wearing that Captain's coat you've got no right to wear. - I buy coat. - Maybe you did. And maybe you didn't, but you've got no right to wear that medal somebody else maybe died for. And don't waste that warpath look. Tell my niece to put up at the hotel till I get there Sunday. I'm glad Johnny MacKay is arriving with her. I just come along for the ride. Bill sure knows how to show a girl a good time. We've been drunk a lot of times together. Ah, nothing but laughs. He says I can ride up there with him after we get out in the woods. Used to be my job, riding up with Bill. Mr. MacKay used to be an Indian fighter. But he's a peace commissioner now. Well, after I ride up there with Bill well, you can be alone. And have some fun. Watering place. Everybody out! Ladies to the left, and gents to the right. You sure picked yourself a playmate this time. Ah, she's all woman. You know, Modocs can scare that seat empty of most females. But not Lily. - She's a card, ain't she?. - Yeah. Tried to get Nancy to sit on my lap. Well, why not? J, look, I'll do you a favor. I'll head for a bump. You know there's nothing like a good bounce to bring folks together. Come on, Bill. Hi, diddle widdle. Oh, there, fellie, I'll give you a hand up. Here you go. Now, you kids get together, you hear? I don't know what she expects of us. Even if we were on our honeymoon I don't see what we could do about it? Bill, let me stay.. - Bill! - Johnny, Injun. Stay down. I just come along for the ride. It was Modoc Jim, wasn't it? I don't know. Maybe. How do you feel about bein' a peace commissioner now? You. Who asked you here? I was just payin' my respects to the deceased. You pay my respects to your Indian friend. And tell him we lost a good Indian fighter when Johnny joined up for peace. But we got a new one now. Me! I ain't runnin' errands for you. And tell him I ain't drivin' with the stage company no more. You tell him if Modoc Jim's still alive I'm gonna kill him. You tell him yourself. Only you won't have to. Captain Jack finds out things. I...I hope I killed that Modoc, Bill. I hope I saved you the trouble. Peace is gonna be awfully hard to get. That's your business.. ...not mine. Bill, I need your help. Don't go runnin' off half wild.. ...killing Modocs. Only one got Lily. You think she was only worth one of them devils? You dish out your peace, Johnny. I'll dish out my end. Can you blame him? He'll go on hating. For every Modoc he kills, they'll kill three whites. The land will be piled high with hate. Peace.. ...it will just be a joke. Can I help you find a way, Johnny? How beautiful! The end of the Lost River Valley. 'This road leads to the Klamath Agency.' Around the bend, is your uncle's farm. Shouldn't we have met him by now? Wouldn't it be awful if he had taken some other road to where he could get me? This is the only road. Giddy up! Message to John MacKay, at Fort Klamath. I am deeply grieved.. ...by word of the death.. ...of my comrade-in-arms and his beloved wife.. ...Mrs. Meek. Bringing the murderers to justice rests with the troops. You understand of course, this sad loss.. ...cannot interfere with your own efforts to obtain peace. And then to Miss Nancy Meek... same address. I've got a message for Miss Meek from the President too. Thanks, Crackel. Thanks for riding over. Are you, uh, going to do like the President says? Goodnight, Crackel. Goodnight. Captain Clark, uh, part of this message is for you. "Bringing the murderers to justice rests with the troops." Who killed them? There were no witnesses. The Modocs won't talk. I'm going into Captain Jack's country in the morning. The Lost River? How many troops will you want? None. None? If I got peace at gunpoint.. ...it wouldn't last. You're not fool enough to go in there alone. He's apt to send your head back to us wrapped up in cabbage leaves. You forget I know him. Oh, excuse me, sir. I have a message for Miss Meek. Excuse me, sir. Oh, Mr. MacKay. Yes. Um, I have respected Miss Meeks mourning for several days now. I know she must need consolation. Well, I'm the only officer who is a bachelor here. So, I wondered if you could put in a good word for me. Like what? - Well, you know.. - 'I'm afraid I don't.' What shall I say? I.. Oh, that is if she.. Well, I'd-I'd hardly want to intrude, uh.. ...but if you could perhaps.. Well, since you're going.. Oh, I see. I shall. Excuse me. The President and Mrs. Grant have offered to take me into their home. They're very generous. 'You should go back, Nancy.' Having no folks.. I couldn't accept that offer, Johnny. I came out here because I wanted to be what they call a "Pioneer Woman." - Does that sound silly? - No. I wanted so much to help my aunt and uncle.. ...to mean something to somebody. I wanted to be wanted. But they're gone, Nancy, you should go back to who used to be your friends. You didn't. You were left alone and stayed. That's not the same. My uncle willed his Lost River farm to me and everything else he had. You can't run Lost River farm. It's impossible. There's enough money to hire help and rebuild. But, Nancy, that's Jacks battleground. And you're going to bring peace to it. Lieutenant Goodsall, miss. Uh, there's a whole delegation of Modocs at the gate. - They wanna see you. - Jack's people? No, friendlies from the Klamath Reservation. They're led by two Modocs named Toby and Manok. That's the daughter and son of the old chief. May I come too? Of course. Manok. Toby. My brother and I have come from the Klamath River to speak for our people. You will bring peace now, Johnny? I'll do the best I can. This is good. We want this very much. Do they? These Modocs, yes. But not all. They're afraid of Captain Jack. He all the time want to be number one. He wants everything only the way he wants. So he gives fervor to the warriors. He's a bad Modoc. I know, Toby. But how do you suggest I get peace for your people. I think it is best that you kill him. Maybe you're right, Toby.. ...but I can't kill him. I've promised the President to get peace, without guns. For Jack, only the gun speaks. Perhaps.. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. Without guns, and without soldiers. Into Lost River, you go alone? That's right, Toby. You are crazy. John. Johnny.. ...he will kill you, I know this here. But he knows I come in peace. He's been told. It's worth the gamble to get our.. ...people back together again. One time you saved my life from the winter river. These long pig tails made it...easy to pull you out. Once you saved my life.. ...now I would like to give my life to you. I don't understand, Toby. Take me for your woman. If you do this, no Modoc. Not even Jack would kill you. I have much love for you. Very much. From the time of the river I have this love. You know this. I've always only been friends, Toby, but I.. You take me for your woman tonight. I want this with all my heart and I will make you very happy. I will do all those things that you would wish me to do as your woman. And I would be very proud. Would you like this? Toby, I'd be a liar if I said no. Then say yes, and take me. And tomorrow I will go with you to Lost River. Thanks, Toby, but I can't. Just to keep from being shot. Is it because of the white one there? A little, maybe. And maybe it's like your brother says.. ...crazy. My brother said Johnny's crazy. He's not. Johnny speaks with white heart. So it is that my brother and I will go with him into Lost River, tomorrow. It is that the killing must stop.. ...and all our people be one again in peace. This is why Johnny goes there. This is why we help you. If we go, we crazy too. And if we not go, we are cowards. When you want we should leave this place? I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak. Johnny. - I just learnt something. - Yes. Why women in the West seem happier than those back East. - Red women or-- - Both. It's knowing that they're needed. If a woman's needed, if she knows she's wanted.. I'm going to stay. I think I can be needed here. I hope I will be. We've come to talk peace with Captain Jack. He says, Captain Jack don't want-- I understood. Think they're bluffing? We find out, if they start shooting. Come on. Where they goin'? They're going to the village to tell Captainjack. At least they didn't shoot. Maybe the shooting comes next. Is that the quick way out? Yes. Is he inside? Yes, with his warriors. You make him come out here. Toby, speak straight. If he start fight down inside there maybe you don't come out again. Fine with me. Didn't you hear? I'm a peace commissioner. Sure, I hear. But, maybe Captain Jack don't hear so good. Hello, Jack. Hello, Johnny. Why you here? What for you come? I think you know why I came. I came as a friend. We've known each other long time, haven't we? I got no business with you. I say this is my country. Your people liars and cheats. I don't lie to you, Jack. I speak straight. The President sent me. The President knows about Captain Jack. He wants me to talk peace. Peace? So you shoot Modoc Jim? He killed Bill's woman. What you do about that? If the soldiers get him, they'll try him for murder. If he's guilty, he'll hang. But that's not my business. That's theirs. Somebody killed Colonel Meek and his wife. And somebody burned their house down. And somebody took the metals off of Colonel Meek's body. You tell somebody that. You tell somebody...maybe Captain Jack kill Meek stole metals, huh? None of my business I find metals by Lost River. Maybe you did, maybe you didn't. That's not what I'm here for. I came to talk peace. But you talk about killin'. In 1864, Jack, you signed a treaty. You agreed to take your people back to the reservation and live in peace. You are lyin'. - You signed the treaty. - You lie. I'm not lying. I was there, I saw it. You took government money and goods. Maybe I don't like where they put me and my people. Well, most of your people like it. You got much better land now than you had before the treaty. You know it. You hear good, Johnny? We not go back. I through with talk. 'Lost River is mine.' Lost River isn't yours. You broke the treaty and you took it. Yes. I take it, I keep it. Pulling the trigger, Jack? You alone here. People call me coward if I shoot you now. You're right. There needn't be any more killing. We can have peace. Maybe I not want peace. I know what President say. President is sick of war. I not sick of war. You give me all Lost River. 'You kick white man out.' Sure, if you get all of Lost River you'll say give me all of Klamath River. You're a two-bit tyrant, Jack. All take and no give. 'When the soldiers come--' Soldiers? You think I afraid of soldiers? I not afraid. I not afraid to die. Nobody asked you to die. You got your choice of thousands of acres of the Klamath Agency. Lost River Valley is mine. I kill to keep it mine. More killing means war, Jack. Then there be war! War is no good. In war, only one side wins. In peace.. ...both sides win. You have council with your people. I'll wait for your answer. Thanks, Jack. You are one man, we are fifty warriors. It takes only one warrior to kill you. Johnny! Is Modoc Jim in there? Bill, you confounded fool. Bill, get to the agency. Go warn the settlers. Mother. Hold her. Mother. Pa! Something's happened. Bill's hurt. We hungry, not hurt you. Not fight white woman. Grandma, what's happenin'? What's.. Modocs on the warpath, spread the word. Alright, Johnny. Thanks. I'm afraid I started somethin', sir. I shot Modoc Jim. Johnny sent me to tell you. The Modocs is on the warpath. - Where's Johnny? - Lost River. Warnin' the settlers. Bugler, sound boots and saddles. Massacre! Massacre! Massacre! Massacre at Lost River. Maybe 20 dead so far. A volunteer company formed at Crowley's farm. Where's Johnny MacKay? Went to meet the Modocs but too late to warn the settlers. Toby and Manok said the whole tribe is headin' out creatin' bloody warfare. Modocs on the warpath. Killing as they come, head for the forest. Why, they won't hurt me none. They've been friendly with me for years. So were Boddy and Sari. But they're dead. Come on! Hold your fire, you crazy coots. Johnny ain't shootin' at you. What's all this commotion, Scarface? Well, look here. I fed you just the other day. I give you ammunition. Soldiers know now. Before you chicken hearts come here maybe you fight now. You make big mistake this time, Jack. What mistake? These mad dogs, they kill 18. Shoot 'em in back, shoot young boys. You call yourself warriors. You kill settlers, Jack? Not yet. Then give these three mad dogs to soldiers better to lose three no-goods than 300 of our people in war. War? You think I have chicken's heart? We kill plenty soldiers pretty quick. Maybe pretty quick they kill you. - Ptah! - Hear this. Today they bury 18 people at Link Well. People these killed. After they put 'em in dirt maybe many white men come with guns. To get them that killed. 'You give them these men, Jack.' You make council, you think fast. You can save our people, Jack. You do this. MacKay.. ...are you familiar with this strongholds terrain? Yes, sir, I've explored it. Captain Clark doesn't believe that even though we surrounded this area we can force delivery of the several murderers. He's right, sir. There's more than a 100 caves in that rock. The Modocs could holdout forever. And you think a siege is hopeless, huh? I don't know. Anyone suggesting we simply give up? No, sir. And I'd like orders to stop being a peacemaker. Your orders come from the President. The only fighting he wants you do is for peace. My orders are to bring these killers in for trial to fight if necessary. But now appears if we want them.. ...we better go up there tomorrow and get them. Through this gap. - 'Miller.' - 'Yup.' - 'Bill.' - 'Here.' Lot of 'em won't answer "here" tomorrow. To think, I started this whole shebang off. I was killing aplenty before you went off that cart, Bill. Captain Jack wanted war. I'm scoutin' for the Oregon volunteers over there. How about you? I'm stuck with being a peace commissioner. 'All present accounted for, sir.' I'm gonna take my volunteers around the east end where they got a better chance. - Good luck, Bill. - Thanks, Johnny. Come on. I suggest that the captain stake the skirmishers from cover to cover before they have time to get us all. 'Form line, the skirmishers.' Form line to skirmishers. Right and left wing. Yo-oh! Maybe they ain't even up there. I ate somethin' for breakfast, it's sitting kinda heavy. You won't have somethin' heavy like lead in your belly if you don't keep down. There's not a sign of the Modocs up there at all. They're there, sir. Bugler, sound the charge. Don't charge 'em! Break up, break up! Let's take 'em down! Just follow me. They can't survive the crossfire, sir. Where are the volunteers? We've got to force that gap. We can't sir, that's where the crossfire is. They'll all be slaughtered. They'll never reach that summit. Bugler, sound retreat. 'Easy, man, take it easy.' Have you seen Johnny MacKay? Any more wounded left out there overnight dead or alive will lose his scalp in the dark. So Johnny and Bill are still up there tryin' to get out all they can. Follow this trail and you're safe. Seen any more of our people? I think we got 'em all. You know this trail leads up the back way to the stronghold. With about 20 good Indian fighters. You ain't thinkin' to tell on the president where to get off, are you? So, you know the back way too? Selling guns to Captain Jack? Winchesters. Nothing but the best for your friend, huh? Pay you well, Crackel? Well enough.. ...to give you and Bill a real healthy split if you keep quiet. Quiet? There are 100 people keepin' quiet tonight because of...your guns. George! George! George! The joke's on him. He probably sold them the guns they killed him with. Secretary of war has instructed me to cease all operations against the Modocs. General Gilliam will henceforth use his troops only to repel attacks and protect citizens. And, MacKay do you think under these conditions we can achieve a peace? No, General Canby, I don't think so. I assure you ladies that vengeance will serve no good purpose. I lost my husband. I lost my two boys in that massacre. And now you say there's to be no punishment for the murderers? I said that peace must come first. The Bible says-- I don't care what the Bible says anymore. I've lost my man. And I'll see those Modocs killed if I have to kill them myself. You see, doc, out this way the Bible and brotherly love gets all mixed up with Injun hate. Gentlemen, the head of our peace commission has arrived. Johnny. Hello, Mr. Dyar, how are you? It's good to see you. We're old friends. I helped this boy bury his folks at Bloody Point. How are things lookin', Johnny? Well, not so good, I.. ...had my first crack at peace-making. I ended up with Lost River massacre. Well, Dr. Thomas says you two met at the White House. The president didn't think it would hurt to have a wholehearted peace advocate on the commission. Glad to have you with us. Shall we attack the problem? We wanna stop this purposeless killing. Any war that doesn't bring about a peace with honor is futile. And peace with honor and peace with Captain Jack are apt to be jackasses of two mighty different colors. Talk is cheap and now the lies. You say talk's cheap. That sounds though you don't think talk will do much good. Have you met Captain Jack yet? I look forward to the pleasure. That's one thing it wont be. You can say that in spades. Well, what do you suggest is a first step towards peace? Meet the man we're gonna make peace with. Well, is it possible to arrange a meeting with Captain Jack? Through Toby and Manok. They want peace as much as we do. Well, fine. Once we've had a powwow, at least we'll have some idea where we stand. Our cause is good. With heaven's help, we can't fail. I hope you're right, doc, but...heaven's as far from that stronghold as it is from Hades itself. Even the Injuns believe them caves lead straight to hell. I'm wettin' my whistle, Johnny, will you join me? Yeah. Soldiers who come with Canby. All come to talk peace, huh? They come to stop killings. Why, you afraid to talk to peace men? I not afraid of brass buttons or bullets. Nothing! We kill many. How many they kill? Why you so proud of death, Jack? Many of our people want to live in peace. You know, Johnny. He talk straight. Eh, once he was fighter. Now, peace man. President Grant, great fighter. General Canby, famous fighter. Now, all want peace like Johnny. You two wait down there. Come back by and by. We talk it. How long? I send for you. You wait. You talk war, talk in Boston English so my people don't hear. These men come here to fool you, Jack. They get time for get more soldiers, kill us, I know. I kill soldiers for they kill me. Jack, you hear good. Our people want we should kill peace men. You talk already? You kill general or you chicken-hearted woman. You talk crazy. You kill Canby. I kill preacher. Skunchin kill Johnny. We talk already. You kill. You kill or they kill you. If my people want kill, we kill. I ask my people. Get the peace Modocs. Is it peace, Scarface? Maybe so. Who comes to this peace-talk? General Canby, doctor man old man Dyar, you know him. Johnny, Toby and me. - No soldiers? - No soldiers. I make this talk. You go tell peace men they come see me. - 'We talk peace tomorrow.' - Come here? You crazy, Jack. Come to council place, half way. We put up peace tent. Only peace men come. No more, no soldiers. How many warriors you bring? Same number they do, maybe. - You tell him. - What time, noon? - No guns? - No guns. Good. We tell peace men and we tell our people. They will be glad. Manok. - Nancy. - Yes? If the peace talks fail.. ...promise you'll leave this place. Why? With all the troops? You couldn't stop flaming arrows from burning the agency on a windy night. And you.. You up there maybe cut off from the stairs. I had a nightmare about that last night. It was an awful nightmare. I.. ...can't get it out of my mind. Couldn't you've had a sweet dream about me instead? I have those all the time too. Some I'd like to dream all over again. This nightmare, it, uh.. ...scared me. And here I would've said nothing could ever scare you. I think everybody is born scared. You know, I.. When I was a little boy, I used to be scared that I'll wake up in the morning and.. ...my mother and dad and brothers and sisters won't be there. But every morning, there they were. Then we moved West.. ...one morning I.. ...woke up and nobody was there. It was like the nightmare. Except it was real. I was alone. And that's why I'm scared something might happen to you. Maybe I.. ...don't ever wanna be alone again. I hope you never will be. What happens if peace does come tomorrow? I gotta get a job. They'll be no call for peacemaking or.. ...Indian fighters. - I'll have to go to work. - Like what? - Um...maybe a homestead. - I've got a farm. It's a nice farm too. You know, if you get yourself a good man you'll make a lot of money. Couldn't you recommend somebody? A good man? Yes, an awfully good man. Somebody who could do everything around the place? Yes, he'd have to be good at everything. He'd have to know how to plough. Plant seeds. Harvest. 'Johnny MacKay.' Yeah. 'Johnny MacKay!' Here! 'You're wanted at headquarters.' Maybe Toby and Manok are back. Now we'll know. You go on. I have to catch my breath. They refuse to report till they've spoken to you. Captain Jack has agreed to meet us tomorrow at noon. 'Before you start cheering you better let Toby speak.' Toby.. Before she say this, you hear me. My sister is a fool. She could be killed maybe for saying this thing. Johnny has promised you will tell nobody. - 'Is this so?' - Of course. Captain Jack says he will meet you at the council place at the base of the stronghold. This is true. But he not say he will kill you. Yet I believe this is true also. 'Kill us?' How do you know this? - I cannot say. - At a peace council? Out in the open with all the soldiers nearby? That would be sheer insanity. I say they will kill you. What's your opinion, Johnny? I trust Toby. I trust her with my life. You two, you kill Johnny MacKay. You two, kill doctor man. For Dyar. We kill Manok and Toby? Maybe so. We see what they do. If they help white men.. ...we kill. You...which one for you? The big general. I kill him myself. Oh, please, Johnny, you go out to die. Toby, sometimes it's as necessary to take risks to win a peace as it is in war to win victories. But he only says he comes without guns. He only says they not kill. Jack lies, Johnny, I know. And I know our maker will look down on us this day. Sure, he will... in your grave. What do you think, Johnny? What's the verdict? I'm the only one here that made a promise to the president. Each one of you, will have to make up your own minds. Well, making peace with murderers will never be a simple problem. The peace table often requires the sometimes unpleasant need to rely on the good faith of.. ...sometimes faithless enemies. But as a general, I can't back down. - I'm going with you. - Count me in too. You got drafted into this, Mr. Dyar. You don't have to go. Well, I don't know, Johnny. You and me are the only ones that rightly know this country and those Modoc devils. Besides, I figure it'll be worth a trip up there just to see the look on the doc's face when he get shot at. But I sure ain't going without a gun in my britches. Dr. Thomas? Please understand that I'm not blind to facts. That I'm fully aware that your lives and mine are in danger. And also understand this. If it is God's will that I give my life to achieve a peace I'm completely willing to do so. Thank you, gentlemen. I'm very proud. We'll go to the peace place at noon. Please, Johnny, you go to die. They want the leaders killed. I know this. Sure there's risks. But you can't get peace just wishing for it. We must have faith, Toby. You beg for your life before the sun sets. Johnny, you can't go. - Toby says that-- - Nancy, go back to the fort. But Toby tells the truth, I believe. They'll-- I thought all you wanted was peace. - What's changed? - I love you. That's what's changed. More than any peace on Earth. 'Please, don't go, Johnny.' But I've got to. I won't be far though. And if anything happens... army moves right in. In time to pick up your bodies? We promised to meet them. I know it's a gamble. Where's your gun? Dyar's got one. He's a good shot too. But what about you? I'm not taking one. Scotty, could Johnny have your gun? Sure, ma'am. - With my blessings. - Thank you. Please. Just so you'll be around for the harvest. Don't make a date with a.. ...good-looking lieutenant tonight. I won't. I'll wait for you. Thank you. Troop, attention! I want all people to hear this. Toby and me has give warning to peace men. We've been through all that before, Manok. Not so every man will hear. Toby and me, we go out there today. Maybe this is last day on Earth for peace men. If my sister and me, we escape. Nobody points finger at us. We've given warning. They do not listen. Remember this. That's all. Fellow officers and men since we're assured that this is my last day on Earth I bid you a last farewell. Present arms! Modocs starting down. Will they be safe? Lookout. Are the Modoc's armed? I see no arms, sir. When we reach them don't bunch up. mix with them so they can't open fire. If they do attack Dyar and I'll start shooting. - Manok-- - We will save ourselves. You forget we are Modoc too. You speak Boston English, eh, Jack? Pretty good. We'll do good work here today. We're willing and ready to help your people. I speak as a soldier, war is no good. Now, Johnny will talk peace. What is your price for peace, Jack? All Lost River Valley to Klamath. White people, get out. That doesn't make sense. Some of those settlers have been there for 20 years. They not go, they die. There's been too much killing already. That's no way to find peace, Jack. We're all brothers, Jack. We're all children of one father. We want no more bloodshed. We want to be friends. God is watching us all. Trust in him. Maybe I trust God, but not these men what wears brass buttons. They shoot at my people! Only because your warriors killed 18 settlers. Men and boys in their homes, their fields! Don't get mad, Mr. General. You not make peace this way. You, Jack, be a man. 'Talk peace not killing.' Toby speaks well, Jack. The general and the soldiers are here to protect 'and not to shoot.' They gotta go, quick! - 'If you're afraid then--' - Me afraid? I not afraid, Johnny. Me General Jack, now. You think I look like general? Here, take my hat. 'Then, you'll really look like a general.' I get hat pretty quick. No hurry. You keep hat while, then hat mine. You see by and by. You look mighty fancy, Jack, but let's talk peace. I want Lost River. I take it. What you say? Talk quick. You call that peace talk? What you say, Johnny? Say again. We came here as friends. Let's act and talk like friends. I tired of talk. I talk no more. Toby! Firing on peace commissioners! Captain Clark, deploy your skirmishes. On the double! 'Stand by to fire.' I kill Johnny. I kill Johnny! I take Johnny's scalp! I take Johnny's scalp! I take Johnny's.. 'Fire.' Toby! 'Toby!' My sister is dead. "General Canby and Dr. Thomas murdered by Modocs at peace council. Johnny MacKay, fatally wounded. Awaiting orders. Signed, Gilliam." You still want peace, general? These men were murdered negotiating the peace you wanted. The complete extermination of the Modocs would be entirely justified. No, only the murderers must be punished. We still must have peace someday. Why, General Gilliam, use whatever means necessary to capture the murderers and bring peace. We should know, General Sherman.. ...that peace doesn't come cheaply. "Exterminate the Modocs." Exterminate. 'How does it feel to read about your own death?' 'Spooky?' That was printed two weeks ago, it just arrived. You've got it all wrong in more ways than one. Exterminate? Hating gets awful big mighty fast, doesn't it? What do they want us to do? Slaughter the good and decent Indians? Just for a few bad ones? But that's the way it is, isn't it? When the hating gets big enough it's the good and decent Indians like Toby and Manok and the rest of the people who get hurt. Where's Toby now? She's dead because she dared to believe that she could bring peace and goodwill to her people. But who am I to talk? I'm building up a big hate myself. I understand, Johnny. That's why you wired the president. That's right. He's answered your request. Once you're well enough, you're to have a volunteer company to track down the murderers. - I'm well enough now. - You are not, Johnny. - Your wounds aren't healed. - Don't worry, Nancy. At this time, tomorrow night Captain Clark will be marching those Modoc killers back in irons. The Warm Spring Scouts have tracked them to Surprise Valley. Our best troopers are en route to trap them there. They'll reach the rendezvous shortly after dawn. This may be the end for Captain Jack. Captain Jack, Modocs all gone again. And us riding all night to get here. - Where'd they go? - Before the sunrise, gone. Maybe we find new trail. After this forest march, the men and horses are tired, hungry. We'll rest here. Prepare to dismount. Dis-hut! - 'Picket the horses.' - 'Yes, sir.' 'Rig the picket lines.' 'Rest.' But don't be discouraged, lieutenant. This may be our glory day. Yeah, we haven't even seen a Modoc. Exactly what I mean. When you don't see the demons it's time to wonder where they're at. Well, certainly, I hope to see action. Usually, you don't see nothing but a spot of smoke or flash and a strange feelin' of a bullet splitting your gizzard. 'Ambush! Ambush!' - 'Ambush!' - 'Ambush!' - 'Ambush!' - 'Ambush!' 'Ambush!' Captain Clark was ambushed. That's why you were sent for. Now, we're not going out as a rescue party but as trackers. You'll lead the troops in Surprise Valley. We'll go after Captain Jack and his murderers. Alright, boys, let's go. We found Jack. Scarface. Bogus Charlie. 'Captain Jack.' Outsmarted us. Split up, knowing we can't. Why can't we? Dead heroes is coming too cheap these days. Gonna save men's lives. Split up the trackers. Trail 'em day and night till we nail them down to the military. - In favor? - Yes. Let me have Bogus Charlie. Alright, you take half the men. I'll take the two scouts. You take the rest of the men, Bill. Okay. - Who's there? - 'Bill Satterwhite.' We've been tracking about 40 Mordocs day and night for a week. They're down at Willow Creek Canyon. - How many men you got? - Only ten. I'll send a scout back for the troops torendezvoushere. Scarface don't even know. - Maybe he does. - It's Captain Summer. Okay. - Hi, Bill. - How many men you got? Hundred. Got 'em staked out, blocking Willow Creek Canyon. - Captain Jack with them? - Nope. 'They split up, about a week ago.' Johnny and two scouts are tracking Captain Jack. Manok's after the other group. Cavalry nailed down that group last Friday brought 'em all in except Bogus Charlie. Manok killed him with his bare hands. To kill you is easy, but we don't kill now. - You remember this. - What do you want? 'You think we know not you have soldiers down there.' Long time we don't sleep. Maybe we tired. Maybe we quit fighting. 'What you say?' Why ain't Captain Jack here saying that? He is bad luck now. All Modocs quit him. - Modocs come my side. - Where is Jack? Back stronghold maybe. You treat us right. We quit. You tell your people to bring their guns into this place now and I'll see they get protection. We take him so you keep promise. I'll go with ya. I ain't scared of these lizards. Come on, Scarface. 'Look, the smoke.' We'll get down there. Why you not come get me, Johnny? Come get me, Johnny, what's the matter? 'I thought somebody else will someday.' You don't see me. Too bad! 'Where am I, Johnny?' Where am I, Johnny? Hey, Johnny, today you die. You come get gun, Johnny. 'You come get me.' 'Come get me, Johnny. What's the matter?' - You come get me. - Here I come. Johnny. You'll shoot me now, Johnny? No, come on. - You'll take me to fort now? - 'That's right.' I wear general's coat, huh? Sure, if you want to be buried in it. Johnny's bringing in Jack! 'Crew, attention!' In just a moment, you'll see the Modoc leader. Who murdered a man beloved by all of us. General Canby. No matter what anger or hatred you may feel toward Captain Jack remember, he is a prisoner of war and is to be treated as such. He's wearin' my general's coat. The dirty beast. - Rip it off him. - Scotty. - Scotty. - Rip it off him. They hang Skunchin, Black Jim, Charlie first. Saved me for last, huh? You'll never want for anything in heaven, Jack. When you go through those pearly gates you'll find everything there. 'Even without you asking for it.' You say this heaven nice place, huh? You like this place you call heaven? Yes, it's a beautiful place. Then I tell you what, preacher. You like it so much, you take my place out there you go to heaven instead of me. What you say? Well, um.. ...I'll be ready when the great day comes. So, you not ready now? Me not ready neither. Jack. Johnny McKay is here. Don't suppose you wanna see him what with him bringing you to the rope. Johnny? Sure I see Johnny. Goodbye, preacher. Hello, Jack. Hello, Johnny. Why you not kill me out there, you tell me this? To end the killings, we had to bring you to trial. We could have saved a lot of lives, Jack if you hadn't grabbed the country that wasn't yours. I scare everybody plenty, huh? Sure you scared everybody. But you made one mistake. You forgot that people will fight for peace and even give their lives for it. You think peace come now? Yes, I do. Because I die, huh? Maybe. But all of us live and die for a purpose, Jack. Even Toby gave her life for this. We know that. And almost you. Red man think he go to good place when he die. Good huntin', good shootin'. No white ma. None. You not like preacher what talk about pearly gates. You got sense. You tell me, Johnny.. ...you believe there is place like this. Yes, I believe that, Jack. Except, I think it's open for all of us when we die. I think they, uh.. ...even let white man in. If I see this for red man only up there maybe someday I tell 'em "You let Johnny McKay in, he good fighter." Thanks, Jack, maybe I'll see you then. Goodbye. And good luck. And good hunting. And thus ended the killing in the Modoc country. And a peace began among our peoples that lives to this day. Peace that wasn't won by just wanting it. It cost plenty. It left scars. But it showed the country something they had to learn and remember. That among the Indians as amongst our people. The good in heart.. ...outnumber the bad. And they will offer their lives to prove it. -- English --
