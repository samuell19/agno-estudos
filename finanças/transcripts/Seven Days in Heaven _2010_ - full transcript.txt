Why bother? It's just gonna smear when you bawl later. Don't you know that I'm a pro? I don't need no tears. Hurry up, Chin. Alright, I'm coming. Hello. Fuck! I've been stuck in Miaoli since 4:30. Damn it. I'm running out of time. Yeah. My cousin asked me to record the whole thing... Really? I got the bid? Great! I'll pay you later then. Right, my uncle just died... Alright... bye. Grandpa... ahhhhhhh... Who am I crying for later? For papa. Papaaaaaaaa... Hello, this is new star. Who? That's my grandaunt's elder son. Isn't he only a few years older than me? He's being sent from the hospital right now? Ok, I'll be right over. Your body is alright now. No wounds no scars, no illnesses no curses. No wounds, no scars, no illnesses, no curses. Just like when you were young, ready to make a world for yourself. To be disinfected. Excuse me. Are you his son and daughter? Is anyone else coming? Take that stuff with you. Come. Tell your father that we're going home. Papa. We are going home. We can't keep waiting here. Go down, find out what's going on there. Sure. Miss...you believe in Buddha or Christ? What? Does your family worship with lit incense sticks? Oh, yeah we do. I'm sorry! I knew that the most ridiculous journey of my life had just begun. Bo—ee Nice good going... Drink up, big guy. Let me tell you a joke about “cure, no cure” what's that? Listen up. Did you know that? There are two kinds of ambulance sirens. You have to distinguish between the two sounds when you hear the sirens. Really? One siren sounds like wu—ee. When you hear this you need to pull over and let the ambulance pass. Wu...ee. The patient is still curable. If you hear the other kind of siren: “Bo-ee" Then you can ignore it. Hold on. Why take the ambulance if there's no cure? Don't you get it? No, I don't. “No cure" means the ambulance is returning the body home. No cure. Hurry up and say papa we are home. Papa, we are home. Let's synchronize our watches. It's 17:35, right? Ok, 17:35 it is then. Let down the covers. Your body is alright now. No wounds no scars. No illnesses no curses. Just like when you were young, ready to go make a world for yourself. Now put your father's favorite food and things next to the bed. Anything else? You sure know what you're doing. They definitely need these on the other side. Kneel down! Another one? Who is this guy? My aunt's son. My cousin. You have now passed. Your faithful wife and filial children have prepared your favorite items, so you can enjoy them on your way. Buddha will lead you to become a god. You shall bless your descendants His son's Chinese zodiac sign is the horse his daughter's is the monkey. 3 to 5am won't do. Why don't you flip through the calendar again? See if there's a good time earlier or later that day. Well then closing the coffin should be 5 to 7 am. On the third day, and cremation should be on the seventh day. - Will that do? - Yes. Listen up, descendants of the family. Close the coffin on the day 3 and perform cremation on the day 7. Between 5 and 7 A.M... Hello... Lin Guo Yuan. G as in good y as in young. I'm telling you not to make the funeral too fancy. My grandaunt wants to keep it simple. Ok! The song is called Love's Cha Cha. Thank you. Beautiful night city shining shining lights charming music playing again makes me think of you... Love's Cha Cha... I dare not forget. My dear where are you? Love's Cha Cha is sweet and sugary. It's a pity the one beside me isn't isn't you. Thanks for everyone for joining our women's social this evening. Chin would like to remind everyone, please don't forget to drop your raffle tickets into the box. Councilor Wang! Long time no see! Wow, you're even more beautiful than I remembered. Oh, please not even. - Let me make a toast to you. - Thank you. Looking good! Councilor! - Thank you. - The ex-chairwoman of the board Councilor! You know my boyfriend A-yi, his grandaunt's son who lived in neighboring village passed away this afternoon. Oh, wasn't the guy who had a karaoke booth at the night market? - Lin Guo Yuan. - Yeah! Biao is here. Hey, Biao you're here too! Go take care of that construction from last time Cheng! Lin Guo Yuan passed away this afternoon. I had to call him uncle. Oh, you're close then. Yeah! Cause my father-in-law and his brother were sworn brothers. I called him uncle cause my wife did. Well, the chairman intends to send a wreath, but since you are one of his relatives, you ought to show that you care and send more! Um, what do you mean by more? Canned goods tower! Don't put generic brands on it, let's do Taiwan Beer & Vitalon-P. I'll ask A-yi to write out your name in a huge font and display it at the front door. It'll be very impressive! Are you kidding? I ain't the one passed away, I don't need my name written out all big! Councilor, you're so funny. Alright! Bottom up for me and you drink as you please! It's Mr. Chen from Taipei Brother! It's my turn. It's alright, I'm not sleepy yet. By the way. How are you with taking days off from work? Well, Sophie said she'll cover my duties while I'm gone. What about you at the night market? The big guy who sells steaks said that he'll cover for me, too. Ah, I haven't had his steak since forever. That steak... I brought some for papa when he was at the hospital. - Really? - Yeah. Let me tell you something... I was in the same class with your mom in elementary school and junior high. Oh, really? Then I should call you “uncle” not uncle. I was your mom's classmate but... My grandpa was your grandma's brother. Not by blood though, your grandma's father was the godfather of my grandpa. So I have to call your grandma “grandaunt". Therefore, I have to call Guo Yuan, “uncle” your mom should be my aunt. Get it? So you have to call me “brother”, not “uncle”! You mean you were my mom's classmate, that's why I have to call you “brother”... Whatever! Um, is your mother coming back? I have no idea. Let's have some tea. She's with your father in Shanghai nowadays huh? Yeah, but... But they just went to some trade show in Europe. - Sounds like she's doing well. - Uh. Go light some incense for papa. And check if the thicker incense is burning away. I mean finished. - Then light another one. - Ok. Hey, brother. What? Did you ever see papa in a suit? Well, papa looks kinda handsome in the suit. Well... was my mom popular with the boys back in the day? Sure! When she went to night school, she had to commute by bus. Lots of boys waited for her at the bus stop. Were you one of them? Hey, I just told you that your mom is my aunt. You think we are like "The Return of the Condor Heroes"? In "The Return of the Condor Heroes" story, MC addresses FMC who is his lover and martial arts master as "aunt", despite similar age. Hey, brother! How long have you been in this business? I started with my grandpa after junior high school. Are you really interested in this field? Not really, but I think it's a cool job. Cool? Ok, let's check inside. Mei, we have to call him brother. I know. Brother A-yi! Why don't you go home and get some rest??? I'm waiting for the refrigerator it should be here by four. Mei, you should take turns with your brother. Otherwise you'll be exhausted. I know. I just got up. My turn is from 1 to 3 A.M. It's been forever, since I bought any smokes for your papa. He used to smoke two packs a day. He was locked in intensive care for the last few days. He must be craving for smokes. Uncle! These cigarettes are imported. Give them a try. Whoa! It blew the fuse. Where's the main switch? The refrigerator arrived at midnight, the compressor shook the house with rumbles and incessant blown fuse. My heart skipped, each time the fuse blew. Why bother do the delivery yourself? It's faster! Papa, this is Chin. She comes to see you, please bless her to earn lots of money. Bi-ling! Aso! I have to go now. There's another package I've to deliver to the neighboring village. Don't eat the meat! The coffin is here in the alley way. - Come with me, son and daughter. - Ok. Just put the hat on leave the clothes and shoes. When we go to receive the coffin, don't you cry! But the daughter must cry when we return, get it? In the next few days. Someone was always there to give directions. You “should” cry now or “don't” cry now. After a while we got confused, should we cry? Or don't cry? Come here, daughter! Papa. Now, cry! Daughter! Come here and cry! Papa. Come here daughter and cry! Papa. Now, cry! Papa. What is the difference between a Taoist priest's black hat and red hat? Basically, the black hat is for funerals, the red hat is for... Worshipping ceremonies at temple. Oh, then which do you do... I do both. Really? Is it difficult? Nah. But why do you want to learn about this? I just thought... I should experience the varieties that life has to offer. Hahaha. You're something else. Guess what... My day job... isn't a Taoist priest, guess what I really do for a living? You are... an undercover cop or spiderman? Better be Superman! I am... a poet. No kidding? Look! I've written many poems. Wow! Let me read one to you. This one's written in Mandarin. “In the course of life going, when not trying to share... Every moment... With others... The temporary... Solitude. Is a different... Presence.” And... - That's it! - Oh here's another one... Written in Taiwanese. “I fuck the sky fuck the earth fuck destiny and fuck society you aren't my old man! Quit meddling in my business!” Try to recite it. I fuck the sky, fuck the earth... That's not how you do it. Be more... Be more energetic. Genki dashite! Wakatta, I got it! “I fuck the sky fuck the earth fuck destiny and fuck society you aren't my old man! Quit meddling in my business!” Not bad! It rhymes! “I fuck the sky fuck the earth fuck destiny and fuck society you aren't my old man! Quit meddling in my business!” Mei, is your aunt coming back? She said she couldn't book a plane ticket back. Your Aunt Feng is very lucky. Married a rich husband and she's able to travel the world. Where did she go this time? Europe? Europe? Is that the place my son took me to last year? Nah, you went to Australia! Oops well they all sound the same. Didn't Feng and A-yi used to be a couple? Why did they break up? Cause Feng wanted to work in Taipei with the economy as bad as it is, it's more stable to find a man who works for the government. A-yi didn't want to work in Taipei, said he wanted to stay here and take up his grandfather's trade. Oh, that was a pity. Can't help it with young people nowadays. We can't make decisions for them. I heard Feng's rich husband opened a yoga studio in China. And she gets to run it too. Having her own business at such a young age! That's right! Back then... Young people from the countryside all wanted to work in the city. The beautiful Feng. Decided to leave home in spite of A-yi's objections. Worked as a hairdresser in Taipei. Feng worked as a hairdresser in Taipei. In those days... Hairdresser was a popular job. As expected, after few months. Aside from learning her trade, Feng also got a rich boyfriend who married her right away. A-yi stayed in the countryside to inherit his grandpa's business. Feng! Invited A-yi to the wedding banquet? Which came as a huge blow to A-yi and he was depressed for many years. Damn the ennui of life! What good will dwelling on it do for me? I'd rather just have another glass. Discouraged and defeated, everyday A-yi drank vodka as it were water. Fortunately, several years later. Chin showed up! Chin came from a small village, she came to Changhua to learn flower arrangements and decorate meeting halls. She met A-yi and they became fond of each other. Chin is candid and willing to learn, she's willing to do anything! She caught onto things after learning just once, whether it's directing a band, or crying professionally for the deceased, Even as a cancan dancer on the float. She does everything with a bang. She and A-yi aren't actually married, but together they run a successful funeral and entertainment business. They're well-known in the villages. But this time, his old lover Feng might be returning home. How will that affect A-yi and Chin's relationship? Mei, have you seen A-yi? He was just out there somewhere. Oh, I see him! Brother A-yi, your “dream girl” is calling from France. - What dream girl? - Ha! My mama! Heho, Feng! Hello, A-yi! I'm still in Paris, there's a big strike in the airport. So I think I can't make it back. Um, ok. Is there someone to help you out? Yeah, her name is Chin. She has been very supportive. Oh. Ok. That's good then. I'd already got the ticket, you know... Will you please burn more paper money for my brother? - Of course, I'll take care of it. - Here is really... I'll take care of it. Thanks a lot. Yes. Call me if there is anything. Come visit us when you have time. Sure, I will. I really want to go back, but you know how it is. Too bad. Guess you are really busy. Yes. Well let's keep in touch. Fine. Bye... Bye-bye. Au revoir, goodbye don't be silly. 4 chairs! This 150 million dollars is for Lin Guo Yuan only, other spirits are not to take the money. This money from his sister Feng and brother-in-law Zhuang Wen Yao. Give me that! You each take a corner around me forming four angles. So other spirits won't be able to steal the money from your father. Go stand in the corners! This 150 million dollars is for Lin Guo Yuan only, other spirits are not to take the money. Listen up, my dad is really tough! Back then he was... Hey what are you saying about papa? Oops What? Never seen a girl with a facial mask? I was just telling him about papa you know? Papa. At that time. When he was in for renal dialysis in the first week a young nurse stuffed papa a note with her number on it. You're kidding me! He picked up a girl during his dialysis treatment? You didn't know? Those hospital rooms are so luxurious! Each patient has his own TV. Wow sounds like in the hair salon! That's right just like in the hair salon! Those patients just kick back like they're getting their hair done. They even make jokes about each other. Ah... there was one time, when I visited papa there. Papa told me that the person next to him was my classmate's father from elementary school. I had to call him “uncle”. Are you ok? It sounds like a class reunion the way you tell it. Exactly! No matter where you come from, you are bound to meet each other again at the same places. Mei, can boys use those masks? Sure, let me get you one! - Hey, I want one, too! - Ok. Copycat! Fuck you! Take it! Haha... Don't laugh you'll get wrinkles. So what happened to that nurse? I'll tell you but you have to promise not to tell anyone else one day. When I came home, I found... The nurse chatting with papa in the living room. Just chatting? Not sure. Maybe they heard my motorcycle. So they just pretended to be chatting. You should turn off your engine next time. There's next time? Didn't papa ever mention this to you? Nope. I thought he told you everything. You wish! Well it doesn't matter now, mama passed away a long time ago. Papa was free to do whatever he wanted. Who cares? None of your business! Don't cry, you'll get wrinkles. You're annoying! Here's one more for you! So, are you happy now? Good? A mask isn't a panacea. We all get old eventually. What are you doing, brother? Hurry up, it's time to chant the holy verses again. Damn, how did I get a stye? I'm doing all the crying, how come you're the one getting the stye? Tears do cleanse your eyes. Fine then you do all the crying from now on. Let me see! It's really swollen! Does it hurt? Of course! Ah, the young nurse! Who? The one papa dated! Go light some incense for the guest! - Hurry up! Hurry up! -Coming! - Are you the daughter? - Yeah. Your father said you did well in school. It's really nothing to brag about. I rarely saw you at the hospital. Um yeah. I didn't come back often. Where is your brother? Over there. He... um... he got a stye. Really? Let me take a look. - It's okay. - Don't worry. I can see pus coming out of it, do you have a first-aid kit? Yes, I'll go get it. Let me disinfect it for you. This needs to be covered up to prevent infection. Wait... Can I keep this? Sure. There's plenty more where that came from. - Would you like to take more with you? - Yeah... No but thank you. It's fine you can take some more. Remember to drink more water and stay away from the sun. Hey, it's 1pm, still sleeping? Listen! This funeral is holy great! And my brother is a please... I mean a priest! Hello are you listening? Yeah. You tell baldy that our graduation project is gonna be a video on the funeral. You guys just have to treat me to karaoke after I'm done with this. Ok?

So I am not in Taipei now. Would you please call Sophie? Ok, thank you, bye! Mei, you speak English at work? Sometimes... Stop chatting! Let's figure out where to move this thing to... - This way. - This won't work! On the count of 3 everybody let go and run outside! Now I'm interviewing the son of my mother's brother, Da-chi. Mr. Da-chi, what are you doing right now? These are the ashes from the paper money we burned over the past few days. Now I'm putting them into a bag. - Is that so? - Yes. And what is that thing on your arm doing for? You mean this? This is a symbol of being filial to the deceased. What about that on the wrist? It's the deceased's leftover money to bless the descendants. Really? How are you feeling now after uncle has passed away? I don't know. Err, can you tell me I don't know. Go ask Mei! Ok! Ok! Stick this on. Take this bag to the river and let it float away. Before you let the bag into the water, remember to ask the river gods that the money is for your father. So he'll be able to use the it in the underworld. - Understand? - Yes. - You know how to do it? - Yes. Then stick it on! Where should we toss the bag? Here should be fine, right? I'm tossing the bag now. -Um. Water gods, please take this paper money to my father. - Let's sit for a minute. - Ok. Brother... What? I finally understand that saying. What? You know how people say “exhausted like 'crying for father'” now I know just how exhausted it is to cry for father. “Crying for father” Mr. Lin Guo Yuan's funeral ceremony is now starting.

All gods from the underworld, please lead the deceased to the land in the west. Give me the spirit flag! Hold it! Son of the deceased hold the ancestral tablet! Open the black umbrella! Give way!

But you know what? After the graduation... - Insurance - Insurance industry? She got a PhD, now she's doing insurance. what can we do for a living, last time I... I had hella fun! What? - I almost forgot to tell you guys. - What's up? My dad died. What? Are you serious? When did this happen? About 4 months ago. Why didn't you tell us? It's not a big deal. I often forget about it too. It's true... I often forget... later on, it frequently becomes too heavy without realizing it. Some day since papa died, on the plane leaving Hong Kong for Tokyo. Watching the flight attendants pushing the duty-free cart. Subconsciously it reminded me before going back to Taiwan, remember to buy you a carton of yellow long life cigarettes. This flashing thought made me cry for an hour and a half. Until the seat belt light came on, until the captain's public address sounded. Sounded like your voice... You said please stow your emotion, we are preparing to land. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
