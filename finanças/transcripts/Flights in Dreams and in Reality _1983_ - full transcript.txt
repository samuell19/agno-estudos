The members of pedagogicaI conference of Russia start discussing problems of perfection of youth education today. Nikolay Pavlovich, Kolya, the matter is top urgent, save me. A life is in your hands. It's not very young life, but it is life. What has happened this time? Mother. Train at twelve o'clock. Mother? Mother... I must meet her. Last time you had flood in your apartment. Don't you believe me? And before that what happened? I ask you, what happened before that? And before that he gave lecture about flying in dreams and in reality in "Erudition society". Take your place and work. Svetochka, it concerns you too. How old are you, girI? And what is the matter? How old are you? If you really want to know, I'm almost twenty. How are you planning to live further? Normally. It's started. You'II live normally, but never rightly. And do you want to know why? You have insulted a man who has double the age. He is almost forty, and you are almost twenty. Leave her alone. And what if I'm really flying? Then you're welcome. And what if my mother is really coming to see me? The son has birthday in three days, forty years. The mother is coming to congratulate her son. She is old and slender. Go on, go on, smile. Go on! Don't shout at me. I don't shout, honey, I cry. Leave her alone, fooI. It's empty in here. It's one of his jokes. It's a poor joke. Nikolay Pavlovich, well, Seryozha will be forty in three days. And we have forgotten. We have forgotten. Let's say, I remember that. What do you suggest? First of all, let him go. Secondly, celebrate. Whatever one may say, it is forty years. Concerning the first thing, I have no objection, he may go. But I think that his birthday will be on Sunday. So will we celebrate it today or on Monday? Seryozha, when is more convenient for you? All right. We will decide ourselves when and how we'll celebrate it, without the hero of the occasion. He must hurry up. Well, comrades, after all everybody is unfair sometimes. Are you mad? What? Seryozha, don't do that. You scared the hell out ofme. You look wonderfuI. I'll give you twenty five rubles now and the rest afterwards, OK? Seryozha, Seryozha. Thank you. Pass! Well done! Hey, man! Squad is coming through! Hello. Hello. Is it for bags? I was walking and I knewthat I would see you here. You've always had great intuition. I own it. Seryozha, do you remember that you've always made dates with me here? I remember. Why aren't you at work? And why aren't you? I have thing to do. So do I. Look here, I'm preparing for your fortieth birthday. During operating time? Why? During dinner break. Pretty flowers. Are they for me? For you. For who else? Thank you, dear. You're welcome. Are you going home or at work? Are you in a hurry? I'm not now. Hello. Excuse me, please. I hardly escaped. I lied. Do you know where did they let me go? Where? To my friend to civilian registry office. Listen... Now we can go. I'm chattering and you must be in a hurry. I'm not in a hurry, but he is. He has acute sense of civic responsibility. Who, Seryozha? What are you talking about? He has nothing acute. And he isn't in a hurry. We're just going to open-air. In other words to the country. Yes, to open-air. Though Seryozha will be forty in three days, we decided to prepare everything now. We are building a cottage. It's a wonderfuI place. Seryozha promised to show me his flying. To tell you the truth, he promised to show it only to me. But I invite you. Will you go? Good girI, a smart one. Is there something wrong? Everything's right. I think these are for you. How pretty they are. I'm crazy about them. He's thoughtfuI. You just can't imagine. I suspect it. Oh! What? I think I know you. At last! Make your acquaintance. It's my wife. I'm Natasha. Pleased to meet you. I'm Alisa. I think I'll get out. Sit down. Let me go. Well, if we all are here then let's talk. About everything. Or have we nothing to say to each other? After all this, I haven't. And you? I have something to say, but I'll say it later, Seryozha. OK, then I'll talk first if you don't mind. There are two women here that are equally close and dear to me, but I'm connected with one of them only because of duty, and with another because of everything except duty. And the question is: what shall I do? Women, sweet, dear, I'll be forty in three days, and I'm utter fooI. To whom of you I should lean? Lean against telegraph post! Let me go! Open it! Open at once! Sit down. Let me go! Let the girI go. She'll calm down and forgive you everything. No! Never! I despise you! And you had no reason to talk all that nonsense! Let me out ofhere! You weren't like that, Natasha. You also weren't like that, Seryozha. I always was like that. You just loved me and didn't notice, swallowed everything. Do you have apartment keys? Yes, I do. Show them to me. What for? Please. You don't need them anymore. You can keep the bags. You may need them. What happened? It's all for nothing. First of all the train was late, secondly nobody came. There are no errors, it was the right train. I traveled through the whole train, there were many strangers, but there wasn't my mother. Congratulations on my approaching anniversary. Thank you. Maybe something happened. God forbid she is ill. Comrades, let's live in peace. Our department is very small; I swear to God I'm bored to death with it. It will be difficult for you to live with a husband, Svetochka, very difficult. And when you'll come to your senses it will be too late. Svetochka, aren't you ashamed? Not a little bit. They'll understand when they get hurt with hard times. She'll run into such a man and he'll be putting her in her place. No, he will not. He'll put you in your place, have some doubts. I myself was like that, I know. Don't judge by yourself. While he'll be putting me in my place, I may cuckold him. Bravo. Bravo. That's young people response. While he'll be putting her in her place, he'II lose his place. You're charming. I adore you. If I could I would merry you. And can't you? Unfortunately. It's a pity. I had better opinion of you. It sounds like provocation. Are you provoking me? I'm surprised. No, you are provoking me. You cast a false fish-hook to see if I bite. Stop fooling around, stupid. Stop fooling around, stupid. Who told you that I'm fooling around? I'm arranging my destiny. Don't you care? Well, I do. Svetochka, will you be my wife, please? I don't believe you. You are right. You are right. I appreciate that. I don't like when people don't believe me. That's why I declare openly that I lied to all of you today. No mother was coming to me, I went to no station, and I simply ran to a date like a cat where I was caught by my own wife. That's all. FooI. Serega, are you joking again? No. I told the simple truth. Then you know how it is called. Approximately. I'll formulate exactly: baseness. You could think of something more originaI. Well, I think that I express common opinion and suggest you to... So must I hand in the application? So must I hand in the application? The sooner, the better. With the greatest pleasure. So does anybody have any requests orwishes? OK. Seryozha. Thank you. I'll take it into account. Nobody has anything to say. And they? And we believed you. I almost burst into tears and you lied to us. Nerves, Nina Sergeevna, nerves. There won't be enough tears if you cry because of every trifle. It wasn't a trifle. Do you know what did Nikolay Pavlovich say after you had left? He said that we should be ashamed. He said that we should be ashamed. So why aren't you ashamed? And what should we be ashamed of? Ofeverything. There you are! You lied and we should be ashamed. I'm not ashamed at all. Are you ashamed in generaI? Are you ever ashamed of anything? Fancy that I'm not. I live by other rules and I look square in the life's eye. You are a good person. I envy you. How do you think, is Nikolay Pavlovich ashamed sometimes? And I think that he is. Kolya, Kolya, are you ashamed sometimes? And I think that he is. Kolya, Kolya, are you ashamed sometimes? I don't wish to talkto you. You may sit, you may sit. We are simple people. However you should be ashamed. You criticized me for going to the date during operating time and you didn't even reprove yourselffor such fact. You criticized me for going to the date during operating time and you didn't even reprove yourselffor such fact. It isn't true! You have no right to throw mud at man whom everybody respects here. Nina Sergeevna, I understand your touching attitude to your chief but fact is a fact. There will be facts. Larisa Yuryevna. Larisa. What? May I distract you? Well... Please. Go ahead. Do you promise to tell the truth? Here you go. So the question is... Stop it. No, Kolenka. Stop it. No, no, no, no, no. Stop it for God's sake. Calm down, my good man. There is no holding him as the saying goes. Beauty, our unfading, tell me please, where did you go three day ago with our much-esteemed Nikolay Pavlovich during operating time? Really. I want to know it and everybody wants to know it. Really. I want to know it and everybody wants to know it. For example, I absolutely don't want to know it. And even furthermore. Seryozha, do you really want to know it? I really-really want to know it. But you already know everything. The main thing for me is that he knows everything. And he knows everything. I know nothing and I wish not to know it. I know nothing. I repeat that the thing that you are saying, all this show... I can't apprehend it otherwise than... You are surprising me, Larisa. I'm sorry. It was a stupid joke. Why am I surprised? I'm sorry. It will never happen again. I'm sorry. Granny, how much for the flowers? They cost ruble in the morning. And yellow, lemon. Oh, who do I see? Ladies, do you remember a carthis morning? Sorry, sorry. Hallo. Salyam-aleykum. Miss, please, call Alisa Suvorova. Who is it? It's her uncle who came from Alma-Ata, the city of wonderfuI melons. Thank you. Thank you. OK. Miss, I brought her melon for a present. Where am I? On Perehodnaya street. Should I wait? Thankvery much. I'm waiting, I'm waiting. Miss, hello. What is it? What do you want? Alisa whom? Suvorova. Alisa whom? Suvorova. What? Maybe you workwith her. Will you call herfor me?

At first she runs away and has her nose in the air and then he's hers. You know what? it's OK. You should take care of him and don't turn him out. Let's go, comrades. Give me this melon. Let him go, I tell you. How are you, Seryozha? I'm fine. Seryozha, are you feeling better? Better. Really? Much better. Very well then. It's a present for you from your uncle from Alma-Ata. Did you lie? How could you? Sit down, sit down. I can repeat it. Seryozha. I know, I know, I know. I know,Iknow,Iknow. Aren't you ashamed of people? Aren't you ashamed of people? No. They marvelously showed their best qualities. They criticized you. You are an idiot and you don't receive medicaI treatment. Let's get married. Yes, tomorrow.

No, I'll have it later. It's fine flying in dreams. Yes, it's fine. But ifwe talk about reality... People, who try tojump offroofs, well, they have thoughts similar to mine. Yes, you know, it's interesting. Good night! Usually people have such thoughts when they are fifteen or sixteen years old. By the way, even Leonardo dreamt of muscle powered aircrafts. But I think... This is risky, Seryozha. By the way, here is my library. I read them, yes. I give them to my friends to read. Some people don't return them. Let's go, I'll show you something.
