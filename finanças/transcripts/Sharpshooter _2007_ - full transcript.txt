Dillon: EVERYBODY'S GOOD AT SOMETHING. I'M GOOD AT KILLING. IT'S A PROFESSION THAT BY DEFINITION CREATES ENEMIES. IF YOU KILL PEOPLE, PEOPLE WANT TO KILL YOU. A LONG LIST OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ME DEAD. SO FAR I'VE BEEN LUCKY. AND I'VE BEEN CAREFUL. BUT NO ONE IS LUCKY OR CAREFUL ENOUGH. THE ODDS HAVE BEEN AGAINST ME FOR A LONG TIME. THAT'S WHY THIS IS MY LAST MISSION. I'M TIRED OF IT. AND AFTER THIS, I'M DONE. I'M USING A MODIFIED 507, 10 LOAD. ALL POLYCARB RESIN CONSTRUCTION. IT FIRES 6.33-MILLIMETER ORDNANCE. COMPLETELY COLLAPSIBLE AND ADAPTABLE. ONE OF A KIND. IT'S GOT A MUZZLE VELOCITY OF 3,700 FEET PER SECOND. IT'S WHAT I CALL "THE SPEED OF DEATH." AAH! AAH! AAH! DON'T SHOOT! I'LL KILL HIM! I'LL BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT! SHOW YOURSELF! DON'T SHOOT! AAH! NO! NO! PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. THANK YOU. Man: TANGO 4-2, THIS IS WHISKEY 1-1. I'VE GOT A LOCK ON THE G.P. SIGNAL, OVER. Man #2: TANGO 4-2. READY. IS -- IS -- THAT A BOMB?! HEY, HEY. JUST RELAX. YOU'RE AMERICAN. CAN'T YOU UNTIE ME? YOU'LL BE OKAY. THE GOOD GUYS WILL BE HERE SOON. THEY'LL FOLLOW THAT. IT'S A GPS SIGNAL. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE ME HERE! IT HAD BEEN A CLEAN MISSION, ALL IN ALL -- THE BAD GUYS SENT TO HELL. THE HOSTAGE SAFE. THE MONEY RECOVERED. AND ME ALIVE WITH NO MAJOR DAMAGE. A GOOD WAY TO GO OUT, EXCEPT FOR ONE PROBLEM -- ...THAT LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO SEE ME DEAD HAD GOTTEN LONGER ALONG THE WAY...BY AT LEAST TWO. OH, MAN. BETTER MOVE IT. COME ON! YOU WITH ME?! MY LAST MISSION. WOULD IT EVER BE OVER? WHERE COULD I GO WHERE THE PEOPLE ON THAT LIST COULDN'T FIND ME, WHERE I COULD JUST STOP... ...FINALLY JUST STOP? 24-7. MY ENEMIES ARE EVERYWHERE. YOU CAN'T CALL A PLACE WHERE YOU'RE REALLY JUST HIDING A HOME. BUT EVERYONE HAS TO LIVE SOMEWHERE. EVEN ME. WHEN YOU LEARN THE HARD WAY, YOU DON'T FORGET THE LESSON. OVER THE YEARS, I'VE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A FEW EXTRAORDINARY PRECAUTIONS. YOU MIGHT THINK IT STRANGE TO RENT ONE WHOLE APARTMENT JUST AS A DIVERSION. BUT THAT'S PART OF THE JOB -- ANONYMITY. MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW I EXIST. I AM NOT CONNECTED TO ANY OF THEM OR ANYTHING. I'M A SPECIAL OPS AGENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT. SPECIAL OPERATIONS. THERE ARE THINGS THE COUNTRY NEEDS DONE THAT CAN'T BE DONE THROUGH USUAL CHANNELS -- VIOLENT, DEADLY THINGS. THINGS LIKE I'VE BEEN DOING FOR TOO MANY YEARS. THINGS I'M TIRED OF DOING NOW. THAT'S WHY I'M DONE. I'VE SERVED MY COUNTRY. NOW IT'SMY TIME. NOW I JUST WANT SOME PEACE. THAT'S ALL I WANT ANYMORE. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? I SOMETIMES WONDER IF IT'S JUST TOO LATE. PEACE. THAT'S ALL I REALLY WANT ANYMORE. THAT'S WHY I'M DONE. I'VE SERVED MY COUNTRY. NOW IT'SMY TIME. WHAT'S THIS? THAT'S YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT. NO WAY. IT'S A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY. WHEN ISN'T IT? ALL RIGHT. I'VE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO DOUBLE YOUR EXIT BONUS. CONSIDER IT A THANK-YOU FROM A GRATEFUL GOVERNMENT. I'M OUT, FLICK. Man, look... Before you end up being one of the names on these walls, make some money for yourself, man. Retire in style.It's not about the money. All right, what's it about? IT'S ABOUT MY LIFE. LISTEN, YOU REMEMBER THAT DEAL I WAS TALKING ABOUT IN PARIS -- THE ARMS DEAL? WE GOT HIM ON THE HOOK. WE PUT SOME BAIT IN THE WATER, AND HE BIT. OH, AND YOU WANT ME TO REEL HIM IN? NO, NO -- IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT. THE AGENCY WANTS ME OUT IN THE FIELD IN THIS ONE. YEAH. I'M PART OF THE BAIT. YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN THE FIELD IN YEARS. WHY NOW? WE LOST TRACK OF THIS GUY YEARS AGO. HE FELL OFF OUR RADAR. WORLD-CLASS ARMS DEALER. SO NOW ALL WE SEE IS THE RESULTS OF HIS OPERATION. WE GOT SOPHISTICATED EXPLOSIVES POPPING UP IN IRAN. WE GOT TERRORIST GROUPS WITH SYSTEMS THAT ARE ABLE TO JUST JAM OUR TRACKING. HE'S EVEN GOT SHORT-RANGE MISSILES. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON. I HAVE BEEN AFTER THIS GUY SINCE BEFORE I WAS BEHIND A DESK. HE'LL GO FOR IT, BUT THE CATCH IS HE'S GOT TO DEAL WITH ME. FLICK, YOU CAN GET ALL THE MANPOWER YOU WANT. YOU DON'T NEED ME. I NEED SOMEONE HERE I CAN TRUST. I'M SORRY. GET SOMEONE ELSE. MY ASS IS FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY ON THE LINE ON THIS ONE. WILL YOU DO THIS ONE LAST TIME? FOR ME? I'LL BE IN TOUCH. Man: OUR INTELLIGENCE ON RICHARD PHILLIPS IS INCOMPLETE. WE KNOW THAT HE BEGAN IN THE DRUG TRADE IN THE LATE '80s. FROM THAT BASE, HE NATURALLY MOVED INTO THE EVEN MORE LUCRATIVE BUSINESS OF ILLEGAL ARMS IN THE '90s. SINCE THE YEAR 2000, WITH THE RISE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY, HIS BUSINESS HAS INCREASED. LAST YEAR HIS ENTERPRISES ARE REPORTED TO HAVE GROSSED BETWEEN $400 MILLION AND $1 BILLION. IN THE LAST HALF-DOZEN YEARS, HIS REPUTATION FOR DELIVERY OF HIGH-QUALITY EXPLOSIVES AND WEAPONRY HAS BEEN SURPASSED ONLY BY HIS PENCHANT FOR BRUTALITY. AS SEEN FROM THIS FBI FOOTAGE, THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO HIS METHODS OF TORTURE AND MURDER. AS HIS EMPIRE CONTINUES TO GROW AND THE BODY COUNT INCREASES, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HE BE ELIMINATED. PHILLIPS ALSO ENJOYS A LAVISH LIFESTYLE FILLED WITH PARTIES, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, AND LEISURE ACTIVITIES. HIS VARIOUS SHADOW CORPORATIONS OWN SEVERAL ESTATES AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THIS EXTRAVAGANT LAKE-VIEW PROPERTY LOCATED ON LAKE JULIAN IN CALIFORNIA. Dillon: THERE WAS NO DOUBT -- PHILLIPS WAS A BAD GUY. DANGEROUS. LETHAL. THE WORLD WAS GONNA BE MUCH BETTER OFF WITH HIM DEAD AND OUT OF BUSINESS. BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I AGREED TO DO THIS. ANOTHER LAST MISSION? NO, IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE. IT WAS FLICK. THE FACT IS, WHEN YOU'VE LIVED LIKE I HAVE, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS. ALMOST EVERYONE I KNOW IS DEAD. FLICK AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER 20 YEARS. YEARS AGO, WE WERE ON MISSION TEAMS TOGETHER. WE FACED FIRE TOGETHER. NO MATTER WHAT, THAT'S SUPPOSED TO MEAN SOMETHING. IT DOES TO ME, ANYWAY. Woman: THE HISTORIC TOWN SITE OF JULIAN HAS APPROXIMATELY 300 FULL- AND PART-TIME RESIDENTS. JULIAN IS ONE HOUR EAST OF SAN DIEGO IN THE BEAUTIFUL CUYAMACA MOUNTAINS. JAKE. MR. PHILLIPS. HOW WAS YOUR TRIP? UNEVENTFUL. ANY PROBLEMS? NOT FOR ME. IS EVERYTHING IN ORDER? EVERYTHING'S READY. GOOD. I'LL SAY IT AGAIN -- I STILL DON'T LIKE YOU COMING HERE OUT IN THE OPEN. IT'S ALL ABOUT BUSINESS, JAKE. I KNOW. EVERYTHING'S IN ORDER, MY ASS. ANY WORD ON OUR MEETING? MM-HMM. GOOD. Dillon: JULIAN. A NICE, QUIET LITTLE TOWN. JUST LIKE THEY SAID. NOTHING TO DO BUT FISH, EAT AT THE LOCAL DINER, RAISE YOUR FAMILY -- GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS. IT'S A PEACEFUL LIFE HERE. I WONDER WHAT THAT'S LIKE. SO, YOU JUST ABOUT FINISHED WITH THAT STORY YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT US? I'M WORKING ON IT. I HAVE WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE TALK IF THEY DON'T COOPERATE. THAT'S DRILL-SERGEANT TALKING. HE'S A REAL BEAR. HEY, I'VE SOFTENED A LITTLE SINCE MY ARMY DAYS. YEAH, RIGHT. THIS ONE TIME, SHERIFF HERE THREATENED TO IMPOUND WALTER COOPER'S SNOW TIRES IF HE DIDN'T KEEP HIS CAT OUT OF RAY LEONARD'S CHICKEN COOP. GLAD I DIDN'T BRING MY CAT. THANKS A LOT, PAL.ANYTIME, SHERIFF. REALLY, WHAT DO PEOPLE DO AROUND HER FOR EXCITEMENT. WHAT, WE'RE NOT EXCITING ENOUGH FOR YOU? HEY, I WRITE FOR A FAMILY MAGAZINE.

WELL, THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, FELLAS. ENJOY YOUR DAY. THANKS, ROSCOE. MISS. THAT LOOKS GOOD. SO, YOU TAP IT NICE AND EASY. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. EASY. EASY. VERY GOOD. HELLO, JAKE.

LISTEN, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING. I WENT OVER THE TAKE LAST NIGHT, FROM THE MONTE CARLO DEAL. AND STEVIE, WE'RE MORE THAN A LITTLE SHORT. OH, MR. PHILLIPS, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT -- YOU COULD IMAGINE HOW HURT AND DISAPPOINTED I AM. MR. PHILLIPS, YOU DON'T BELIEVE -- OH, HERE'S SONNY. SON OF A -- BLOODY BASTARD! STEAL FROM ME! STAND HIM UP. PLEASE! STAND HIM UP! YOU SKIM FROM ME?! NO. YOU BASTARD! I WAS GONNA HAVE THEM KILL YOU FAST, BUT NOW YOU'RE GONNA SUFFER, YOU -- ALL DONE. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE STEAL FROM ME, BASTARD. HUH?! YOU LIKE THAT?! YOU LIKE THAT, HUH? HUH? STEAL MORE FROM ME, HUH? YOU LIKE THIS? GET RID OF THAT PIECE OF SURE, BOSS. OH! YOU SCARED ME. SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE BACK.

YOU HAVE YOUR FACE TOWEL, YOUR HAND TOWEL, AND YOUR BATH TOWEL. AND YOU NOTICE THEY MATCH YOUR SHEETS. AND I PUT A LITTLE CHOCOLATE THERE FOR YOU ON THE PILLOW. SO... I GUESS I'LL LEAVE YOU IN PEACE. BUT YOU MAKE SURE YOU GIVE ME A CALL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, OKAY? THANK YOU. I WILL. OH. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU, HONEY. BYE. ALL CLEAR! WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? WELL, HE'S GOT NO PRIORS, NO CONVICTIONS. HE'S GOT A LAW DEGREE FROM SOUTHEASTERN. WORKS FOR AN OUTFIT CALLED PAULIE, LEWIS, AND WICKS IN L.A. YOU WANT HIS ADDRESS? ANY MENTION OF MILITARY SERVICE? NO. WHY? I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THE GUY CARRIES HIMSELF. YOU'RE REALLY FREAKING ME OUT NOW, BOSS. HEY, I DID MY TOUR. I KNOW ANOTHER SOLDIER WHEN I SEE ONE. YOU KNOW, STAMP COLLECTING MIGHT BE RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY. WILL YOU SHUT UP? WE STILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM, THOUGH. YEAH. WHATEVER YOU SAY. YOU'RE THE BOSS. OKAY. SHOW IT TO ME. THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. AND WHERE DID YOU GROW UP, AGAIN? I NEEDED TO IDENTIFY THE EXACT LOCATIONS OF PHILLIPS' COMMANDOS. I NEEDED TO TRIGGER THE ELECTRONICS AND LURE THEM OUT... WITHOUT MAKING THEM SUSPICIOUS. Man: WE'VE GOT A PERIMETER BREACH! GET INSIDE. GET INSIDE. GET INSIDE! COME ON. SHUT IT DOWN. ALL RIGHT? WE'RE GOOD. SO, WHAT TRIPPED IT? RABBITS. WHAT? RABBITS.
