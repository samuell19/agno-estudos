They say in his last life he was a giraffe. They say his heart was formed by the Asakura clan. They say the moment he was born a crack appeared in the sky SOUL OF A BEAST Are you ready? Head back! Head back! Close your eyes! You're so sweet. Come here! It's bedtime. Ashole! Zoé! Just... Can you take him or not? Fuck your damn headache! Take care of him just for once! Fuck off! Fuck! Ashole! Ashole! Don't wake him up just because you're bored. He just opened the door. What? Could you? Yes? Joel? Nothing, the door. I was sure they'd go, so I told myself: Let's see what happens. I felt very much... Great. Very smart! How long have you been standing there? Where's Joel? Will you stay there forever? Just a minute. Isn't my father twice as broad as I? I totally pushed him into the ground. You actually came? Oh, Madame! You just tried to kiss my mother. Close your eyes! What's the difference? Your holy underwear is for my eyes only. - Oh... Really? Turn around! Are you sure you'll manage? - Will you manage? - Yeah... no problem! Mom! I forgot the laundry downstairs! Stop it! I'm getting dizzy! Disappear! Let me try. Fly! What's going on? Come on, I'm ready! Alright. Oh what's coming? This... is Guatemala. And it's my farewell party. And the beginning of... Mescaline. That's my girl! Sorry, I gotta go. You really have something better to do now? Damn right, go home! What's the matter? I got him! You're so stupid! Shut up! Joel! Oh, come here! Watch and learn. Joel, where are you going? Damn. No, he doesn't believe... Come back! Come back! Who are you trying to impress? - You, baby. - I just slapped your face. Are you going to the lions now? Damn, I need to go to the penguins. Penguins. Damn... Please stay with me... Where are you? Stay here. Joel's here for the first time. You aren't. Everything happens as it's supposed to. I can see inside you. You're so beautiful. She came from an unknown planet. Her body, home to rare gods. In the color of her eyes... Gabriel? Everything alright? Jamie. I'm so sorry. The joker. Last night, animals escaped from the municipal zoo. Among them an Indian peacock, an Angolan giraffe and the Colombian puma twins, Susan and Sheela. According to first investigations, the animals managed to escape through unlocked gates. Citizens are urged to communicate any observation. Please be aware: zoo animals are wild animals. Jamie? Where's the microwave? Hey. Fresh flesh! Fresh! What's up, are you OK? They're home, you can come up! Where's your mother? On vacation. I thought it would be nice for Jamie to have a bed. My sweetheart? A little bed, just for you? No? Where can I place it? Where should he put it? Wherever, in the hallway. How long will this go on like this? Do you need money? Take it. They've found no trace of them yet. Jamie! Come here! Who's this? My little brother. Just take them off. No, it's fine like this. I'm actually going... There's something in your eye. Wait. Oh no, it just dropped. Your brother's damn cute. But I don't get why people still bring kids into this world. Why? I don't know. Our world is just pretty fucked up. I'd be a horrible mom anyway. I'd probably forget my child in a bus. Your junior walks in outdoor shoeson our court and disrupts our game. Could you please teach him some manners? Thanks. And? Do you like it? Where's its head? There wasn't enough space. Jamie, don't become a pussy like your dad! I really can't remember when she did that damn giraffe. As if you could remember anything. Just tell me the truth. Did you fuck her? Wh... What's up? What an asshole. Little pussy. Don't you think she's really special? The giraffe? Your mother! Corey! Yeah, she's cool. She's got bigger issues than I. Now she runs off to Guatemala, for a whole year. Jamie! Seems like the first time I'm really in love. I can't recognize myself. A whole year? Exactly! You could've come with us. Exactly! I'm sure he has better things to do than hanging around with myannoying cousins. What's marriage good for? And why are you wearing these stupid leather pants? Because they're hot? Do it! Bye. Do you even have a driver's license for that motor bike? Of course! Jamie. Here you have 50. Okay? And here... His cuddly toy, Leo. And this, for... Everything fine, sweetheart, I can deal with children. You're going like this? What's the problem? Today you're staying with aunt Afua. Just for once. Promised. Fresh! The puma siblings have been spotted in the West Wood Forest. Avoid any visit to natural zones, such as public parks and sports fields. Stay in controlled areas only. What's he doing in there? He lives there. He thinks it's safest to lock the door and wait until the disaster is over. What disaster? Mars is moving backwards, something like that. Strange stuff is supposed to happen. Shall we go? Wait! Come with me to Guatemala. We'll work on my father's farm for a bit. We'll buy a car, drive through Guatemala, Bolivia, Tierra del Fuego, all the way to Patagonia and we'll ride a whale to the South Pole. What do you think? What about Joel? Look, everything's going to pass so damn fast. I've had this feeling since I was a kid. Somehow... Ever since I saw you, that feeling has increased... That there's no time... That I have to do everything... Now. We'll do it all with horses! My father has beautiful horses! Together. They'd set cities on fire. Together... The first victim of the puma sibling died a few hours after the attack. The nightly curfew will take effect between 10 pm and 6 am. Torn power lines from a television antenna and traces of blood from the giraffe indicate that it must have injured itself. If they've grown up in concrete they're going to die in concrete. Otherwise, still no more traces of the giraffe. Its disappearance remains a mystery to all of us. Somalia - I'm in love. So...? She... She doesn't know about Jamie. Why? What am I supposed to do? Do you think I'm the best person to give you advice on life choices? We had the same. We all have the same. It's the best. Mom? Could you pick up the phone some time? Everything's fine. It would just be nice to get some news from you... 1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3... Come on, Jamie, you can do this. We'll just say hi. Gabriel, come here! Hi Jamie! How are you? Come. Jamie. Let's go! Excuse me, Miss. Gabriel's here. What are you doing here? Your mom's dancing with 2 flowerpots. Didn't wanna miss that. Why aren't you out there? I'm dizzy and I've got a headache. Don't you think the floor's slanted? It's not horizontal, is it? Do you see that? Maybe you wanna first say hi to Jamie? Jamie! Jamie! Come to mommy! Jamie! Come to mommy! I've missed you very much. You see? What did you imagine, that he'd jump at you jubilantly? Are you really sure that the floor isn't slanted? What am I doing here? I came to see if you're better. And if... Fuck it. Jamie, we're leaving. Wait, I'm really dizzy. Really dizzy. Maybe you've got cancer. Do you think I have cancer? Why do you say something like this? Zoé. Jamie needs you. Sorry, I see it's not a good moment. You could've called, but it's nice to see you. Come on! Let's go dance. I have to puke. Zoé. Come on! Come on, let's go dance! Come on, let's dance! Wait. Just please wait. OK? Mom! We were in the desert without reception. Now we've arrived in Essaouira. It's gorgeous! I could stay here forever. Don't forget the rent! Whatever forever... She's cool. Yeah, she is. Right now she's in happy mode. Fuck. He seems tired. He rubs his ear like you do. Are you coming, Jamie? Are you coming with me? I'll take a little nap. Thoughts... make the clouds shift. Stop! Clouds... cover the sun. Stop! You killed me. I will kill you. Stop! Boo! Am I allowed to talk now? I need to tell... Hey. Hey, Joel. Still wearing the same pants? Exactly. Sweating all day in the same pants. Joel. Oops. Surprise. I bought a ticket. I was really looking forward to it. But you know what? Maybe you can use it to wipe his son's ass. Joel! Wait! Ashole Ashole I couldn't sleep. Please get off the street! I ask you to get off the street! You are inside the curfew! You're bleeding. It's nothing. Should I get you a band-aid? Zoé, what do you want? I have to think about Jamie all the time. And about us. You can see Jamie tomorrow. They won't let me out anymore. You know where he sleeps. The moment you die... a crack appears in the sky. What are you doing? Let me... Please let me. Get off! Gabriel, please. Leave! You want it too! Don't touch me. I know you want it. You want it too! Fuck off, damn it! I'm trapped here! Because you fuck up everything! Stop touching me! Stop touching me! Stop it! You're a mistake! Don't say this! Please... All this because you can't change his fucking diapers! Bitch! - Stop it! Piss off! Leave! Piss off and cure yourself! Piss off! Zoé. Since we mean shit to you, we'll jump! So you're gonna be free! Zoé, he's afraid. You're saying it's all my fault? Let him go. If you hadn't left, we'd be a family. Piss off! Piss off! And never come back again! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Jamie! Open! Please open the door! You are inside the curfew! They're taking my baby! 1, 2, 3... They're taking my baby! It's gone! No! No! Jamie! Jamie! Susan, one of the puma twins, was finally caught. Security forces were forced to kill it. Last night's paint attack by animal rights activists unleashed various protest movements in several districts. Increasing riots are to be expected during the course of the day. We are... We are approaching a state of emergency. Scientists and astrologers are talking about a retrograde movement in the planetary system. The impact on earthly behavior will be more specifically... Oh! You can't take that car! Leave that fucking car here! Why can't you leave everything as it is? Fuck you! I love you. Yo! It's too late to talk. Go find your daddy first. You'll probably find out why you're a traitor. Little pussy. This is for me! For me! She belongs to me. To me! Do you get it? For me! For me! Are you listening? For me! God damn it! Yo, Gabe! Corey! Wait! You can't leave! If you leave now, everything's over! Shouldn't you take care of your little brother? Are you ashamed or what? No! I would've never left him alone, you know that! You have a child, and now what? Millions have kids, that's why we're all here, right? Oh! And what do you know about my life? You just do whatever you want! Lucky you! Have a beautiful life! But you're ruining everything! You're ruining everything. What do you want from me? What? Man... I'm... I cannot help that... That you crossed my life, that you exist. But that's me. I'm like this. I destroy everything... Yeah, it's... It's crap, but it's like in those Indian movies where the main actor tears out a piece of his heart and your name's written on it. And men are always so ugly and women so damn beautiful... Anyway, all this only happens on TV and in Titanic bullshit but... without you... It's all empty. We'll see each other again. I'm sure of it. Take care. Thoughts make the clouds shift. She came from an unknown planet. Her body... home to rare gods. They belong to each other. Forever. Corey, come! Corey! Come! Is there a constellation of the giraffe? Hmm... There... I can see it. It's right next to the big bear... All a lonely child has is... Imagination. One's way to survive. Why don't we take Jamie with us? Afua? Where is he? Where is he? They said it's their child. The woman from the TV! This is Zoé, leave a message. Zoé! Pick up your fucking phone! Fuck, Fuck, Fuck! Gabriel? Can you hear me? Joel's taking me to the airport. Listen, I'm very sorry! Gabriel? Are you OK? I can't hear you! Joel! Joel! Can you hear me? Joel's taking me to the airport! I'm very sorry! Joel! Falling in love. I've been trying to reach you for 100 years. Falling apart. The landlord called. Didn't you pay the rent? I actually wanted to stay longer. But it's such a mess at home. He was a fool. Yeah... Whatever. Just a fool in love. Ashole Come on, why else are you here? Where is he? Madame. If you had just once listened to your daughter, this damned world wouldn't be falling apart. If you leave now, you'll never see your son again. Never. Jamie belongs to me. Forever. A man with a hole in his heart will never be the same again. He has chosen the path between heaven and hell. Target southwest. Unit 3, advance. Respond! OK. Take care. Gabriel? Do you want to listen? We always danced to this. One for my daughter. One for the earth. She hasn't left yet. I know, son. I know, my son. Jamie! His soul had not come along. He had to stay in this place. Until his body was reunited with his soul. You stay here. Shush... It's me. In the color of your eyes, my ancestry. Nothing lasts. I will love you. More than anything... Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
