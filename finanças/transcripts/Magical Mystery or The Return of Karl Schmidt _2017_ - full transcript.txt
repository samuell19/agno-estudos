I wanted to tell you tomorrow, but I'll do it now. I'm going to supervision next week. - Why? I have to. - Who'll look after us? Gudrun. - No! Did you expect the social affairs senator? You're not eating. Were you at the Italian café? Not me! - I told you not to go there? I had an espresso, no sugar. No sugar? Don't make me laugh. I don't believe a word. Tomorrow evening, assembly. I want you all there. No sugar my ass, Karl Schmidt. Hello. Do you have beer here too? Thanks. Charlie! Karl Schmidt! I'll be damned! Why are you in Hamburg? I thought you were home, in Bielefeld. No, Hamburg, Raimund. My mom lives here. When did you leave Berlin? And what is this area? Five years ago, Raimund. And this is Altona. Yes, Altona station, but what area? - Don't know, I live here. Well, cheers to your cup o' Joe! Beer? - I can't, Raimund. And weed? - I can't touch anything. But you get pills. What kind? - Not pills you'd get a kick out of. Probably not or they'd push them. And you, Raimund? What's going on? Man, Charlie, I love it! Everything's tip-top! Remember Bumm Bumm Records? The club? The label? Some ass came out of the blue and shat a load of dough on us. Crazy! We were idealists, right? - Me not so much. And Ferdi? Always there, club, label, all of it. Good old Ferdi. Imagine, he's already over 50. No drugs at all for you? - Just coffee and cigarettes. Must be tough. But pretty awesome too. OR: THE RETURN OF KARL SCHMIDT ELBE MEADOWS CHILDREN'S CARE CENTER Can you eat that? - Where did you come from? This a zoo or something? - Yes. Explains the animals. I'm new here, you know. So I'm asking. The crocs aren't moving, are they real? They do when they get fed. - And now? Can we feed them something? Hold the tongs and dangle the fish in front of the crocodile. So it sees it's still alive. - And then? Eventually he'll snatch it. Nibble, nibble! Did you chose to be here or are you like us? No idea, hard to say. - You have to know that. Who brought you here? My mother. - Your mother? You're an adult. What's with this croc? Is it dead or what? He's fine. - It's already... Boy, that startled me. I thought he was dead. Sometimes a guy doesn't move, but that doesn't mean he's dead. How are you, Karl? - Pretty good. What are you up to? - Stopped up toilet, Group 7. You have to take your month of vacation from last year. By Monday, or I'll be in hot water. - What do you mean gone? Vacation! Thank God a new janitor arrives tomorrow. The new janitor? A new janitor's good. You won't have to do it all alone. I like doing it alone. And he'll be my boss! So? Take your vacation and we'll see. - I don't want vacation. I don't want to go to supervision! No one gives a crap what we want. I got you a place in Lüneburg Heath. St. Magnus, sports, treading water. It'll keep you straight. How do you know about my vacation? I didn't know it, I got the whole thing rolling. Think I didn't notice you haven't had vacation in ages? I notice when my people are being exploited. You could've asked me. - Dr Selge! I told her off. Running things with no clue about contracts. Is she sick? She's a psychiatrist. Then let her shrink heads, not run a public enterprise! ...leave your name and number. You have 30 seconds. Right, 30 seconds. 30 seconds is a bit tight. It's Raimund. I want to talk to Charlie. He can call the office. Someone's here from ten o'clock. Or whenever. Just call. Someone's always here. Wait, the number... Ferdi, the number? Hello, this is Ferdi. The number's 0-3-0-29-33-7-5-9. This is a message from Ferdi and Raimund. Attention! Call, it's urgent! Message for Charlie, over and out! Roger that? Charlie? What kind of guys call you Charlie? Oh, Karl! This is Mr. Niemeyer, the new janitor. Hi. I don't know what you're doing. - Everything. Bulbs, toilets, feeding animals. - Wonderful! Mr. Niemeyer can get to know it all. Keep dangling it, Mr. Niemeyer. Hello. - Hello. Gudrun's here. Okay, people, I'm out. Karl, take the train I wrote down. They'll be in Uelzen. I'd take you myself... I'd better take you. No, Werner, I've got this. - It's... There are indispensable people all over, in cemeteries and in supervision. Okay, I'll go and pack my stuff. - Yep. Take care, Karl. You'll get your train to Uelzen alone. - Definitely, Gudrun. Every dunce manages that. - You said it. Get the train Werner wrote down. They're waiting in Uelzen. Well? You dimwits? No way! Charlie. Ferdi. - Look at that. Have a seat. Now this moves me, it does. You look refreshed. I'm on vacation, Lüneburg Heath. Treading water, sports... I don't follow. - Oh, it's an inside joke. Want a Bumm Bumm bonbon? Yeah. - Sometimes they're orange flavour. Kind of our own little trademark brand. Tell me exactly what's up. - Let's grab a bite. I'm hungry. Let's have a nice lunch at Lala! Nice soups here. With mushrooms. We're always here. - What exactly is this is about? Exactly. "Magical Mystery." Something for the soul. Money isn't everything. We need to feed our souls. Like The Beatles, just rave-style. You understand? - Didn't that bomb with The Beatles? Sure, but... Magical Mystery, that's sexy sloganeering. Raimund thought it up. He's in the club, let's go there. We had to do next to nothing. The site was ready, just clear rubble. The place is always packed. We've had the club three years. I can't wait to hear what you think. Weird place. Are there even emergency exits? "Emergency exits?" What's with you, Karl Schmidt? Ferdi! - Oh, my love! Well? Yes. It's just ten days. It's no big deal. You just drive us and look after us a bit. Charlie, it's easy! We'll give you 4,000 marks. You have to stay sober anyway. 4,000 marks? - Okay, 5,000. It's only money. Raimund, we're here! Charlie! Ferdi brought Charlie! Good old Charlie. Everything will be good now. What's this ugly racket, Raimund? Rosa's playing her new track for me. Great stuff. - You bet it's great. Let's eat at Lala, I'm hungry. Ferdi tell you everything? - You want to go on tour. Who all is going? - Anja and Dubi, Holger and Basti. Plus Rosa here, Ferdi and me. And Sigi, you know her from before. And Schöpfi. - The "Hallo Hillu" guy? Hold this. - Yes, we're all going to Springtime. After we do a little club tour. - Little? It's not little at all. - Okay, a tour. But DJs on tour, that's weird. - There's nothing weird about it. Schrankenhusen-Borstel scares me. - Schrankenhusen-Borstel's fine. Listen, the techno thing is messed up. Since yahoos started buying everything with a beat we sell 60,000 records every day! Money is coming out of our ears. I really don't think it's so bad. Money is also a show of love. Yes, Raimund. But music stands for something. Bumm Bumm Records is gumboot techno. But our new label, Kratzbombe, now that's where the love is. Love? Why love all of a sudden? - There's more. We got a megadeal with Fluxi Hotels. Fluxi Hotels all tour. How cool's that? - Fluxi Hotels? They're all the same. Yeah, very Magical Misery. Mystery, not misery. - Is this adult ed or something? You can't always think of money, at least not only. Back to the beginning, Charlie. You know how that was. That was five years ago. Sadly, I can't remember it. The club was small, we were poor. We were pioneers. Now they shat us full of dough. The club and the label are huge. Money all over. And now they want our souls. Ignore him, he's been up two days. You have to come, Charlie. At least drive us. Dave wants to drive. I don't want that stinker around! - Dave has done you no harm. I don't want him to come! No sense of community, no love. How did he even enter my life? Every company needs a Dave. Company's without a Dave go bust. For example? No idea, they went broke. No one remembers them. That's no proof. - Who cares, this isn't a court show. The charts come out soon, Charlie! Cha-ching! Well! Totally awesome office, eh? All Washington Post-esque and all. All Watergate! Watch this. Dave! - Here. Do you have the itinerary and hotel bookings? I'm nearly finished. Sorry, I'm just not getting the info. You're done. Give Charlie your stuff. Desk, too. Go sit by Holger and Basti. What? They're folding flyers. Why? I don't know. Just join them! Charlie, where are you staying? - Not my place. It's being renovated. - Mine's all paint and wallpaper too. We'll fix him up with a hotel. - Or here, with a cot and blanket. Washington Post-esque! Managing editor and all. - Is that all right for you? It's Ferdi's stingy week, no chance. - It'll do. The charts! - Managing editor, genius! Let me see! Schöpfi, Two. - HostiBros? 15! Yeah! I hate the charts. I'm never on them. What'll we do now? I'm hungry, can we go eat? But not to that soup place. Some real food. And you were in the madhouse? Yes. So really like... Loony? I mean like really... Gaga? - Yes, it was like that. Because of drugs? - Yes, that too. Well, I can't take any anymore. I live in drug-free housing. - So it was drugs? No clue, they make one guy go nuts and not the next guy. So not the drugs? - My mother says it was the drugs. What's she got to do with it? - Then the drugs are to blame. If drugs aren't to blame, Mom is. Everyone knows that. Who gets the Styrian fried chicken? Me. And the Viennese fried chicken? - Me. I see it this way: if it was drugs, you can avoid them. If it's something else, then it's more problematic. Okay, then it was the drugs. - Yes, that'd be convenient. I still don't think it's good for us to start an affair. Um... Yeah. I mean no. - In any case it isn't wise. It may be good, but not wise. At the moment I'm more into wise. But some time or other we should... cut your hair. Hello, Charlie. Remember me? I'm Sigi. - Yeah, sure. Hello, Sigi. Hey! Charlie! Pecker! Frankie the Woodpecker. That was once so. I'm DJ Schöpfi now. DJ Schöpfi? "Hallo Hillu" Schöpfi? Sure! I don't make a big deal of it. The name doesn't matter. Frankie, Schöpfi... It's chill, Charlie. That's enough. Everyone listen here. Announcement! It's Magical Mystery time! And Charlie is our boss. He's the first guy techno drove mad. It wasn't even called techno then. He played drill for Glitterschnitter. You were all in your daddies' nuts! Got it? You'll do everything Charlie wants. Basti, Holger? Sure thing! - That's that. The car looks like crap, Ferdi. Where's the glamor? It's just what we had with Glitterschnitter back then. It's got a coma cot to crash in. I don't need that anymore. I was happy when that was over. I imagined flutes much smaller. It's a saxophone. You all have so much stuff? Here, Charlie. Pretty tight. There's no more space. Right. - It only seats nine. We're 11 and only nine fit. Charlie's too many. - We'd be ten, still one too many. Someone else will have to stay here. - Yes, you! If you stay here, we can ponder if we'll take Charlie or not. Do you have luggage on board? No. - Bye! Hurry up, Charlie, or you'll ruin our sweet exit. That's crap, starting the tour a man down! Oh no, this is Magical Mystery. Broken eggs make an omelette. And you have to kick someone out to bring a group together. Here, the maps. - What route to Bremen? Via Hanover or Hamburg? - Hanover means taking Ku'damm. That scares me! - There's a McDonald's the other way. Good. We can do some community building, to rid us of the bad Dave vibes. Hear the whistling? Will it blow? - Doesn't sound like it'll blow. It's driving me nuts! - The van's tip-top. What's up? - The car's broken. Really? - I don't see anything. Let's roll. There it is again. What's the deal anyway? - The whistling, brainy! What whistling? - It could be dangerous, right? Oh! They're not dangerous, just hungry. They're my little sister's. She's on a class trip. Guinea pigs, eh? - How sweet! Guinea pigs! - Call them Lolek and Bolek. Or Kruder and Dorfmeister. - Depending on what? Ah, salad! I always wanted to know who orders salad at McDonald's. I had guinea pigs once. Let's roll! A call! It's actually a call. Raimund! Your telephone. Yes, hello? What? Uh-huh. Hello? Holger, Basti, where is the merchandise anyway? We forgot it. - That was Dave just now. He mentioned merchandise, but then he cut out. Did you just say "forgot it," Basti? - Yeah. We have guinea pigs, but no records, no CDs, no T-shirts? That's what I just said. We forgot all of that. Hello? Uh-huh. We have to go back to McDonald's. We forgot Schöpfi. Then Raimund answered quickly. Then you all came back right away. In the old days I'd have waited forever. It's great, you call from McDonald's and then just hop in the car. How cool is that? - Do me a favour and put out the joint. Really? No joint? - Not in the car. Can't we drink beer either? - Of course you can. Can someone put this cassette in? Anyone got something to smoke? - Who's is this? Don't know, it was behind the seat. - Around again. I've nearly got it. No matter. Just drive... That way. - Hey! We just came from there. Then go around again. - Yeah, again! Go around again! I thought the Fluxi thing was a joke. It's like living in Tupperware. We have a deal with them, Magical Mystery tour sponsor. The hotel with the elk. Very Swedish, it's genius. Here's the key card for your room. - Thank you. That's a pretty elk. But I'm not sleeping on the cot. Three-bed rooms! Ferdi's nuts! - I heard you. It's just for tonight. Right, chop-chop! I'm hungry. Right! Where can we eat around here? What did you have in mind? Mediterranean. - Mediterranean... Right, guys, before we hit the club here's the deal. Charlie will pick us up at eight in the morning. He'll be ruthless, leatherneck through and through. He'll rough you up if he has to. Nothing personal. Because that's how we want it so we can get to Cologne. They can't think we're pansies for we're leaving at eight. So be tough as nails, Charlie. Well, Charlie? - Well what? Can you do that? Anyone who doesn't come at eight gets an ass-kicking. Awesome! So, Heino? All well in Bremen? - All's well, all's well. Beer? - Yo! Not for me, thanks. I'm off then. Here. Take the phone, just in case. Ferdi has one too. Press here and here and it'll call Ferdi's number. Easy. Okay. Till tomorrow morning. - Sure. Tomorrow morning. Did you see the elk that was there? By the elevator. Huge, expensive as hell. It's gone. - No, sorry. They're up in arms about it. - Yes, terrible. Who does this thing belong to? Awesome, I pressed a button. - Hello? Ferdi? Give it here. Hands off! Who is it? This is Sigi. - Hi, Sigi, it's Charlie. Open the door. The bell is useless. - What door? To the club. The one you came in. - Where are you, Charlie? I'm outside, Sigi, in front of the door. I'm going to hang up, okay? Oh, Charlie, how terrific! Right, there's another door. I can't find the handle. - Stop groping, Sigi! Charlie, you've gotten really fat! Fat everywhere! But muscle too. No groping! This isn't a cattle market. Sigi. Sigi! Sigi! - Charlie! Karl Schmidt, you're killing me! Last record. Five more minutes! The track's just one more minute. - Five more minutes! Last record! - Five more minutes! But the track's just one more minute. - Five more minutes! Hello, guys. - My God, Charlie! You started me. "Startled." Buy a bag of German. - Hello, I'm Sigi. Hello, Heino. Charlie, take this to the bank. And this here is the card to. "The card to." Buy a bag of German yourself. Okay, and now everyone out. Shit! We just got our second wind. I want to stay. - Nope. It's eight, that's it. Get Holger and Basti off. Like I said. Charlie, all leatherneck. True, Heino. We have to go. Let's go. Come on, Ferdi. - Just when it was getting good. All leatherneck! Leatherneck through and through. It sure is ugly here. Let's go. Has any of you seen, um... Anja? - Yes, me. In my room. - She was crying. She's gone. What now? Hey, you're here too! He pulled us out of there. Bit early. It was good just now. Lay off the coffee or you won't be able to sleep. We don't have a hotel in Cologne. Anja is in my bed. And Dubi's in the other one. And Charlie already slept on the cot. Anja wanted to sleep with me. - I'll change the bedding. Then you can at least sleep on the cot, Schöpfi. I could sleep in Rosa's... - No! But... - No! I see! Now you don't have a bed at all? - No matter. I have plenty to do. Here! In case you want to lie down. I saw nothing. Ah, fresh linens! Ah, look. What's going on here? - What kind of a critter is that? Yes. - Is there a guinea pig in there? - There are two. How sweet, there are two. - They're from South America, right? Yes, Latin America. - So they speak Latin. COLOGNE Ferdi! Ferdi. Good you're here. Everyone's here. You're a big hit. Wednesday is mini-Saturday in Cologne. One of you needs to go DJ. Your merchandise is already here. - Awesome. Thanks. Hello. One of you has to go on now, because it's basically mini-Saturday. Hold on. "The flute hit"? Does this look like a flute? I thought it was a flute. - It was always a saxophone! Beer anyone? - How embarrassing. It's a sax and we sell it as "the hit with the flute"? Nonsense! This isn't a music school. No one will notice. Where can I lie down? I need to. - What? Lie down? Now? On Wednesday night? Hello, guys. Charlie, you'll give me a heart attack. Charlie, this is an emergency. We have to do something! Where do we live anyway? - Germany. I said to go abroad. Belgium is just around the corner. - Raimund, I meant that rhetorically. I'm getting tea. Do you want tea? Good for the ticker. I'll get us all tea. Yeah, you get tea. Yesterday was a disaster. I don't know how we'll survive if we don't get to a Fluxi soon. Yeah, why aren't we in one? Because Ferdi hat a greed attack. The student in Ferdi emerges. He even brought a lunch box with warm food to work. Normally the bash goes till noon. Who needs a hotel, right? - Smoked pork, beans, potatoes. Ferdi had that in his lunch box. - I don't get what's with Alex? He's doing some after-work crap. Kicks everyone out at one o'clock. Should've done it with Solid Groove. They think we suck. I told you that. - I don't believe it. They can't think that! We were friends. - They've thought that for years. Because we do commercial crap. - Commercial crap? What's wrong with that? It's nice when people like us make money hand over fist. Anyway, we had a talk. We need a collective initiative. Some output. Something artistic. Charlie, a movie, like The Beatles. We're going to shoot a movie now. That's something that builds community! Charlie, we can start now. Germany, German techno, Cologne Cathedral. Magical Mystery, the whole thing with everyone. That's uber-awesome! Now we'll have fun! - Performance art with film. Exactly. And you have to film it. You're the artist. - I'm not anymore. Come on, Charlie! I mean, it's all so handy. German techno, Cologne Cathedral. That's world-famous stuff! Shit. - That's shit all right! We'll postpone that. Yes? Werner Maier, Clean Cut 1. Is this Raimund Schulte? Yes, this is Schulte. Put on a nasal voice, Karl Schmidt, I know your voice. Listen, I don't know what you want from Charlie, but he's not here. I see. When will dear old Charlie be around? Listen, I was just about to take a chamomile steam bath remedy. I've poured it and it's getting cold. We have to speed this up. And I don't know you. I'm not giving you any info, you old asocial worker. Ha! It's you, Karl Schmidt. Your odd babble gave you away. - I don't know what you mean. Fine. But tell Charlie, if you see him, as I'm sure you will soon enough, please tell him he should call me. I don't have a fancy phone like you, Mr. Schulte, he can reach me at home. Werner, I don't have time now. I'll call back later. That's you, right? - Yes. It was to be my first big exhibition, but I was committed right before it. I've never seen that. - There are more. A whole bunch. - I can imagine. It was all junk. You don't look ready for the nuthouse, you actually look... You look pretty good. Kind of a hot dude. Yeah. That was another life. I was a big deal or... Or I was supposed to become one, or felt like I was one. Off. Look at that guy. Two weeks later he was in a hospital in Berlin. All of life, like a film. And we're in the leading roles, and are immortal. And everything's grand and exciting. Even the poverty, the cold. The work, the smog, the binges, the hangovers. All something big and beautiful. At least that's what we thought. Somehow magnificent. But also magnificently stupid, like this guy in the photo. 25 marks. MUNICH I know how to build community. We can drink beer with a brass band. - Good idea! A bit of tradition. Don't you have to wear lederhosen? - Yeah! Will you buy us lederhosen? We're broke. - Watch it or you'll stay in the Fluxi. In Unterschleissheim! Lederhosen! Lederhosen! - Lederhosen! Come and sit with me And drink a bit over here Drink another beer That's right. Ours is already empty again Soon it's over and done, my dear So come over here to me... No harm done. And to say goodbye... Charlie, Flapsi, the club owner here. - I know. Great! I thought it was great the way you took him out of here. Now you have to stand in for Basti. - That'd be great too. We can't go on with no HostiBros. They have a hit right how. They have to play! - But I can go on without Basti. No! You're the HostiBros, not HostiOnlyChild. I don't look like Basti. - No one can tell. Who knows what Basti looks like? I'm talking faceless techno, Charlie. It may be hours before you go on, Hostibro. Come drink a soda with us. - I can't hang out there. Too dangerous. You really were in a nuthouse? I can't really imagine it. We had a guy in Ochsenzoll Clinic, he was from East Germany. He said "nutty" instead of nuthouse. He went around all day saying, "I'm in the nutty!" He couldn't believe it. I prefer nutty, nuthouse sounds final, like "end of story" stuff. Nutty sounds fun. Like messing around, screws loose. And how is it when you're mad? Imagine you're at a funfair, in a whirly octopus or something. Your car breaks off and flies over the fairgrounds. And soon it'll hit the ground. You fly through the air and you know you're going to crash down soon. Your insides cramp up and you know soon it's going to get really nasty. You duck down and infinite fear seizes every limb. And that feeling, that feeling, that's how it is. Day and night, all the time. That's how it is? No. It's much worse. That was a poor comparison. I see the two of you. Where are the bar tokens? Everyone else has them, except me! I didn't see you two. I won't tell the others. Yeah. I'm Sigi! We won't make a big deal of it. No way. - I don't mean the fire alarm. Me either. The fire alarm is a good story. - Yeah. You could tell the grandkids about the fire alarm. Yeah. - To grandkids you share. Or it'd be pointless. Charlie, let them enjoy themselves. Easy, Charlie, easy! Go on, you twerps. Bomb again and it'll be the last time! Why again? No idea, he always says that. What should I do? - Shake your ass. Two words: faceless techno. He's on it! I'm Sigi. Charlie, what are you doing here? This is my room. I just put you in here temporarily. Oh. And now? What's going on? I can't sleep. We could go on an outing. I need stuff for the guinea pigs. Hay, carrots and stuff. It won't be easy, today is Sunday. - An outing? Carrots? Crazy. Hey! I just had a fish! There was a fish, I caught it with my hands. Shit. Charlie, come here. Here. Lolek is dead. Oh man, no! Dead, just like that. He was all peppy just a bit ago. Did you give him something? They don't just die. Sure they do. They're old, seven years already. I got them when I was 12 in the GDR. - I thought they were your sister's. I gave them to her when I moved out. You gave him something to eat. It's nasty of you to get in my face, Basti. If you give them leeks they get gas and explode. Now stop it. Does he look like he exploded? Should we bury him here? - You have ptomaine on your hands. That can kill you. - Or trash can? Ferdi should decide that. One of us should say a few words. Lolek was basically one of us. Charlie, you fed him. Okay. Well... I can't really say much about Lolek, I don't really know him. What can one say about a guinea pig? They eat and shit. And in between they squeak. Lolek did that too. And now he's dead. Nonetheless, I liked him quite a lot. Even if it was just because I could feed him each morning. And any day that you start with feeding animals isn't a wasted day. Lolek and I had the same daily rhythm. We were awake during the day and slept at night. I mean, this Magical Mystery baloney, Beatles there, love here. You're DJs. You spin records. You're not pop musicians like the Beatles. It goes all night long. You can't do that as a tour. It's madness, and you all look shitty right now. But, despite that, I believe this Magical Mystery thing is good, and that it's good that I'm here like it was good that Lolek was here. Because everyone can take part, even a guinea pig. That's probably the true connection between you and the hippie thing. Anyone can be a part of it, even a guinea pig and an ex-nutcase. That's why we're having a burial ceremony for a guinea pig It's strange, but it's good. It is good. Also, to come back to Lolek, he was a pretty cute guinea pig. And he was one of us. Yes. That's how I see it. And now he's dead. And now it might be a good idea to throw him away. Here you are. I got lucky for once! Right, off we go. They can't be alone, we have to buy a new guinea pig. Although, then Bolek will die and... Or we buy two new guinea pigs, then Bolek can die in peace and the other two can live on. I'd be stuck with guinea pigs forever. I can't keep buying guinea pigs my entire life. I don't know, but it's animal torture if he's alone. Charlie! Do you know anyone in Hamburg who has guinea pigs? Where we can take him tomorrow. What are you doing? - Man! You'll give me a heart attack. Look here. A guinea pig. It can't be left alone. You can't put it in with bunnies. Guinea pigs only like guinea pigs. What'll I do then? It's all alone. - Put it in the kitchen. Then they'll find it and have to get another one. I can tell them he can't be alone. They'll get another one. - Tell who? Hartmut, my child care worker. Trust me. I'll take care of it. We'll just stick him back in here. We'll put the box right here. They'll find it. You have to trust people or you won't manage in life. Hartmut tell you that? - No, I figured it out myself. Bye. I've been waiting for you. I thought you were coming at six. It's Wednesday. In Cologne Wednesday is mini-Saturday. Yeah, sure. But most here have to leave at ten. You've got nerve, coming here. I thought I was supposed to come. - That's true. What kind of guys are these? - Raimund and Ferdi, this is Gudrun. Gudrun. We just learned of your existence. Here. I gave him lettuce, I hope that's right. Look, it's Kruder. - The home asked if you were crazy. I always liked Kruder best. - It's Dorfmeister. You in a cult? Why are you guarding him? Us guarding Charlie? It's the opposite. - You live here? No, in the place next door. - I mean in Hamburg. We're deejaying tonight and have to kill time in town. What can we do, as a group? Something community building. In the daytime. - In the daytime? You're techno dudes, right? - We say "teschno," not "tekno." We ate fish and did a harbour tour. - That's good. Yeah, but we did that yesterday. Do it again today. Again? You're techno dudes, you're into everything repeating. Take a harbour tour and eat fish again. Just do it again. - Yeah, I've got to go. Bye, fellas. That's one strong woman, oh boy! Just do it again, it's genius! What? Eat fish again too? You didn't listen, Raimund. We're doing it all over again! I can't take this much longer. I can't wait till Springtime. Canetti, Charlie. Canetti, Crowds and Power. Every unorganized crowd crumbles, if it doesn't grow. That can happen to techno. - Ferdi, you said that three times. Yes, I have. Now I've lost my train of thought. - So? Then it's over, that's it. But I want something to remain. Did Raimund tell you we need you to cater at Springtime? You need me to cater? - It's not so bad. There are lounges. Someone has to see to it. Ensure there's always beer. People will have fun, so will you. You'll be catering boss! Catering boss. That'd be a good album title. Yeah! - I don't know. Come on, Charlie! - Ferdi! I'm an ex-nutcase with depression. If I'm "catering boss"... - Catering boss! ...and start tapping beer... - Catering boss! What... - Catering boss! Catering boss! Charlie, the catering boss! Oh no, God! - Catering boss! Thomas, dude! Springtime! There he is, good old Shorty! Yeah, here I am. - Aloha, Ferdi. Yes, sir. - Shorty, old boy! Aloha, Raimund. This is Charlie, our catering boss. Show him it all with Ferdi. We're eating asparagus. Springtime is asparagus time. Right, this is the crew. Come on, everyone gets a lanyard. Your pass. - Thanks. Hey, come here. And who are you? - I'm Sigi. Look at that! - That's where you'll be playing? Yeah. Not everyone. The HostiBros, Schöpfi and maybe Raimund. The others have to play Hall 4, with hitless electro foot-scratchers. Ah, there you are! - Hans! Ferdi. - What you got? Freshly painted decorative cloths! "Bumm"? - Put them side by side and have... Bumm, Bumm, Bumm... Bumm! Genius! - Bumm, Bumm, Bumm! Hans, this is Magical Mystery. Anything with "Magical Mystery"? No, just "Bumm." Hans, we talked about this many times. We're doing Magical Mystery, Hans. Ah! I don't have any gaffer's tape! I need gaffer's tape. - And beer. Charlie, we need beer. Then people will come. Beer! Well, Charlie?! Beer for me too? Everything cool, Charlie? Ferdi, Werner. Werner, Ferdi. Here, have it. It's got coke in it. Coke? Screw that! - Werner is from Clean Cut 1. Oh! Is that a label? Clean Cut 1? The place where we picked up the guinea pig and met the woman. Gudrun! Oh, Gudrun. Great woman. I'd marry her. Go ahead, I already divorced her. I have to talk to you, Karl Schmidt, without these clowns. Then come around here. How did you even get in here without a backstage pass? I have a Red Cross ID. And a Charity Association ID. I get in anywhere. I'll tell you something... Tastes funny. What the hell is this? Just taking off like that? I had to do it, Werner. Sorry. And I'm not coming back. - Where will you go? Berlin. - I see, Berlin. Then all's dandy. Get a nice job in a bar or what? Next you'll say, "Maybe I'm not a drug addict." Let me tell you something... Charlie's friends are my friends too. And it's only the best for them. - Thanks, you dope! I see through you. In reality you're a cool dude. You think you've got it under control? Because you were on your own for two weeks. Let me tell you, start thinking nothing can happen and you'll be screwed, Karl Schmidt. I'd be careful with the coked-up beer. Screw that! I didn't go into this work because I have the problem. Although... Let me tell you something. Then just say it, Werner! Stop with the hints, chicanery, and the dramatic pauses. Just say it, Werner! I'm not sure you even have a drug problem, Karl Schmidt. Sometimes I think it's what your mother wanted. That that stupid Dr Selge worked it so you'd be put in Clean Cut 1. Maybe you were just a basket case, off your rocker, bats in your belfry. So? Sip of beer? - Screw that, Werner! Think I'm dumb? That I can't see through your bull? That I'm afraid of drinking again? If you think I don't know you, you may know me just as little. Werner Maier! What about Astrid? And Klaus-Dieter and Henning? And Thorsten? Haven't they lived with you nearly five years? You have to come back once, to assembly. Explain it, or they won't get it. - We'll see. Think it over. - I will. Right, I'm going to have some fun. Look after yourself, Karl Schmidt. - You, too, Werner Maier. Good God, this music! How can you even stand it? You know where the HostiBros are? Nope. Help me find the HostiBros! Come on! Charlie! Make sure no one's looking! Everything's cool. Up, come on. I don't care, this is no place to sit... Whoa, watch out. Come on, go. Yes, I'll do that. Charlie! Just look at that! Crazy. Yes. Charlie? Charlie! Listen here, I have to look after to the HostiBros. Here. Take Anna and Dubi to Hall 4. Here's the way there. Hurry, they're on soon! Don't leave me in the lurch, Basti! Get up! Shit! Raimund! - Holger! Bodo and Rama Noise are here now. - You're late. They're here now. Till later. - Thanks Charlie. And if you screw up, it'll be the last time! Yeah, Charlie! Awesome, isn't it, Charlie? I love it! Totally like Glitterschnitter. We didn't have a sax in Glitterschnitter. That was the best thing about it. Yes? Okay, I'm coming. I have to get beer. Move it, Karl Schmidt! Beer?! - It was beer. I saw it! And the depression? Mr. Niemeyer? - His mother's fault. The drugs are to blame. - I can only take this if I dance. Charlie! Wake up! Charlie, wake up! Charlie, we need beer! Beer! All empty. The guy wanted to bring more but never came back. And now? Look, they're all going. We urgently need beer, Charlie. Schöpfi. Schöpfi's up! "Hallo Hillu." Schöpfi's playing his megahit off the bat. That's mega-tasteless. But awesome too! Schöpfi is our best by far. Raimund is too, of course. Basti and I were good too. Holger! Schöpfi and Raimund are in another league! What'll we do with this lounge? Without beer it's crap. Let me close up. You go to Magnetic and drink on. Genius! We'll save a bit too. BUMM AT MAGNETIC You don't have anything to drink. - No. I can't drink beer. Ferdi says this even has coke in it. But I don't believe a word of it. When are you up? I want to watch. Six. I wanted to lie down before, but I can't get out of here. Same goes for me. I'm in Hall 4 later. You know where that is? Yes, I can take you there. It's another two hours till then. That looks great! Yes. I never thought it'd be a big deal. Yeah, I can't wait to see Hall 4. I have to ask you something. - Yeah? I'm thinking of moving to Berlin. Yeah. And what's the question? Well, the question is if you would think that was good. Yeah, sure. Why not? So you wouldn't think that I... Nope. I was wondering. Because... Yeah? Yeah? No idea how I should put it. What's that? I think... Well, you and me... You know. Boy, you've really got it. Yeah. Looks like it. Yeah, well, talking isn't everything. Let's go to the hotel and get down to it. What time is it? Just before eleven. Hall 4, what a load of crap that was. Why didn't you wake me? I wanted to come along. There was no waking you. Plus, you have to be fresh to drive us home. When are we leaving anyway? No idea. I'll run over to the venue and check things out there. But come back! Don't leave me lying here alone. No way! Hello, guys. Good that you're here, Charlie. I'm really not well at all. I can't lift my left arm! It really hurts! Heart attack! Heart attack! Oh. Better hurry. Urgent! What's going on, guys? Ferdi. He's in there. Heart attack. He's already so old. He's already over 50. Now he's going to die on me. Just like the guinea pig. Hey, people! We're not dead! Ferdi! Easy, Raimund. I'm way better. And the left arm? What's with your left arm? I took my jacket off so he could look. And look here, a nasty bruise! Because of how I fell from the stair leaving your set. Thank God! "Because of how I had fell..." Buy a bag of German, Ferdi. - Yes, you can say that all right. Okay, it's time for us to head home. - Take care. Good that you came. We thought it was good too. - Any time. I can depend on you. Okay, let's go! - Take care, Ferdi and Raimund. Take care, Shorty. And you too. - I'm Sigi. Can we go? - Great Springtime. You Magnetic guys have got it. - Hall 4 was crap. Sigi, easy. Love, peace, harmony. - Hall 4 was awesome. I'm having a beer. Pity you're going. - Sorry, Shorty, I'd stay. Charlie here is a real leatherneck. I'm powerless against him. That's the Magnetic guys' problem. They're so ambitious. They always want to be the last ones. We're not dead yet! Is this Berlin? - Yes. Ku'damm. I just don't know... Is it really a good idea to go back to where you once were? To where you went crazy? - Why not? Here, take Ku'damm. I know all of this. It's... I've been through all this. You can't just come back like this. Just chill out. You don't know most of it at all. You didn't even register the other half. I've never looked at it that way. You see. - Charlie! Can we finally get off this lousy Ku'damm? It's nearly over, Ferdi. Are we there already? - Yeah. Is this Berlin? - Yeah, man. I don't know this at all. - Ku'damm. Where are we playing tonight? I think the tour's over. - Really? Well, if this here is Berlin... Subtitling: SUBS Nathan Fritz
