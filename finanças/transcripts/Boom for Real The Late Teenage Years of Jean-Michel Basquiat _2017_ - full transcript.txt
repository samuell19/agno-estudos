One week ago, New York City... tottered on the brink of financial default. The big Metropolitan city has become obsolescent. Decay and pollution have brought a deterioration in the quality of urban life. The financial resources of the city and the State of New York were exhausted. Responsibility for New York City's financial problems is being left on the front doorstep of the federal government... and unless the federal government intervenes, New York City within a short time, will no longer be able to pay its bills. I can tell you... I can tell you now... that I am prepared to veto any bill... that has as its purpose... a federal bailout of New York City to prevent a default. There's an old saying... the harder you try, the luckier you get... and I kind of like that definition of luck. Because New York had gone through one of the most insane white flights, neighbourhoods which were historically low income, totally fell apart. One of the biggest blights would have been the Lower East Side at that time. Landlords were faced with 20 percent, 30 percent, occupancy and at some point or other, they started figuring out that there wasn't going to be any new flood of occupants anytime soon, and they might as well just get the place burned down for the insurance money. It was dangerous. Anything could happen basically. There was no law. People were selling drugs right out on the street. And it was just totally empty, empty, empty, empty, empty. And quiet. From my apartment on Saint Marks between 1st and A, there was a polish bar down the street uh, where the juke box was just completely stocked with some Bobby Vinton records. And, um, when they had the door open on a warm night you could hear Bobby Vinton all over the streets, that's how quiet it was. ♪ I have nobody for my own ♪ The streets were so intimate and so loving, like, you could just sit on a bench and meet somebody who you could spend the whole day with, you didn't even know who they were. And share really... secrets, intimacies, uh, eat together, share a joint and then meet others on the way from one point to another, to the park, end up at some club or a party. I guess the punk thing happened. There was this very sudden shift, um, of separation between people who were remaining in the old school and people that were branching into this, sort of new, unknown territory. New York's like this insane magnet for people, for their aspirations and desire to reinvent themselves. Certainly the poverty, the crime, the danger, the... all those, uh, seductive aspects that would fit in with a generation kind of coming of age with a lot of neolism, the no future generation. We wanted turbulence, you know, we wanted risk, um, we wanted danger, and we wanted to play to a crowd, frankly. There were a couple of years, it seemed, when everybody knew everybody and everybody was doing everything. Everything came together. Upstairs at the Mudd Club at the end of the night were filmmakers, artists, there were musicians and interested in what each other were up to, uh, finding tremendous overlap. Meanwhile the downtown art scene people were opening themselves up to other cultures. A lot of traditional hierarchies had broken down. African American cultures, urban culture was entering into the art world. I mean for forward thinking people the age of the... of the white male was already over. I guess he was always... around, as we all were from one club to another. He was definitely everywhere I went, like he would be there, right. You know, you'd be at Tier 3, you'd be at CBGB's, you'd be at Mudd Club, he'd be at all the art openings and he'd always be quiet. And he was striking once you met him, it's like you knew him, he was... you couldn't... he was indelible. You and me, and we're walking, a nice little romantic walk. Out of nowhere Jean came running up and was talking to us and like, "Hey Jim, hey, oh you're Sara, what are you guys doing here?" And then he just disappeared and you said something like, "Well, wow that was strange," and I said "Yeah, I think ...you know, he's just like that," and then he came running toward us from having gone around the block with a large red flower in his hand that he'd obviously stolen from some market, and he ran back up to us and gave you the flower, and he said something like, "You're beautiful," or something and then whoosh he was gone again. But he was always trying to steal all the girls. When I first met him... I guess just a few months short of 16... he was living on the street, you know, he'd run away. The Earl and the Albert, like they were really sleazed out hotels and he would end up staying there with God knows who. He had a great way of expressing himself, so, he was really language oriented, and I guess I was too. And we kind of ...kind of connected on that level. So we came up with this thing, SAMO, you know, this is the same old shit. I mean, it was... it was a logo, you know, SAMO, copyright, dot dot dot. Me being a graffiti artist, I thought it would be a great idea to start writing it on the walls. The first ones were, "SAMO is coming," or "SAMO 4 U," dot dot dot. You would see, like, "SAMO as an antidote to blah blah blah," and then you'd see a broken bottle, you'd see... you know, just the environment of the city around it, his work was a texture like the crystals in the ground. I saw his writing on the street before I ever met him, and I loved them instantly. One didn't know who SAMO was, but his work was extraordinarily memorable because frankly, there was a lot of graffiti around at that time. I remembered... theVillage Voicepiece on SAMO, which is like incredible, like you know, for anybody that did anything connected to graffiti to get any kind of relatively positive exposure was a revelation. After the Voice article, Jean did actually jump on that. Decided he wanted to be the face for SAMO. I was kind of, um, bitter about it. All of a sudden Al was gone and then I found out they had a falling out... Jean's not letting Al write SAMO anymore and I never really understood, um, what that was all about, but pretty much didn't see Al again after that. He kept it going in a different kind of thing, he started writing, like, his musings and these little poems. His work was just ...it was odd, it was very conceptual, it was very curious, it was... it was almost alien. You saw it once and you remembered it. I mean it wasn't, like, your name or some kind of beautifully crafted piece, it was, uh, something to consider. You know you took a minute, you read it... and you contemplated that. "The whole livery line bow like this, with the big money all crushed into these feet." You know, plush, safe, I think, you go like... what the hell is that? Several of the SAMO quotes would be attacking kind of people trying to play the art game with their parents' money, exposing people trying to be bohemian on their parents' dime, whereas we were really scuffling and trying to make ends meet. I had these shows, you know, and film shows and art exhibitions at 5 Bleeker Store and suddenly there would be all these, like, SAMO tags outside. I was like, "Who's doing that?" Not on trains, not in the subways, not around the town, they were just specifically close to Soho which was an art neighbourhood. He just wanted to get attention from the art world more than the general people on the street. His approach to the art world, at first was, he'd be this gadfly. He was adding his asterisk, you know, he was adding his unanswerable... answer, you know, um, and that had to do with his ambition but also his, kind of, impishness, you know, um, and also his sense of being an outsider too. Yes, you saw SAMO, and it was really different but you were noticing a lot of stuff so it was part of a conversation happening. Graffiti had had such a profound impact on the consciousness of New York, so to be an artist in New York then, you couldn't help but be, uh, informed by it. The graffiti kids, they had a huge impact, it was a whole worldview, uh, that I found incredibly inspiring, I still do. Nothing about graffiti was celebrated. It was the scourge of the city at that time, it was hated. I mean it was a blight to a great extend but there was a lot of creative energy within that blight, which people didn't take the time to look at and examine. Wait a minute, there's something developing here, that's a real creative expressive form. And Lee is just the Leonardo da Vinci of subway spray-painting. Well over 100 whole cars. To paint one of those cars you have to imagine, you know, you have an eight, ten hour window of time to be able to go to a place, you know, be very vulnerable for that. But the results the next day was fantastic. You know, when that train arrived, you felt like you arrived with it. When I met Fab 5 Freddy, he caught up to me in my school, basically asked the teacher to ask me to step out of the room. I thought he was a cop, I thought he was an undercover police officer coming to apprehend me, you know, he was the first one that I experienced as a person that came on as a fan. Fred was very well-versed about the art world and art movements and he even actually tried to bring the group into conversations having to do with reflecting on the arts, on the outside art world. I had known about the beginnings of rap music and DJ culture before any of this was known as hip-hop, and I thought, this is a part of a whole cultural picture. The music, this kind of painting that we're doing and breakdancing, which would typically go along with the rap music, I felt was one important thing that if we could showcase together and put a frame around it, it would make everything else we're doing, look good. It didn't take long for me to realize, yeah he's... he's trying to make comparisons, you know, like the Italian futurists were moved by World War I. You know the horrors of that and the Industrial Revolution. I mean, you know, the city was burning down, literally. I remember going to the Bronx and seeing the hues of orange in the sky and the murder rate was at the highest point ever. And then to go back into the sanctuary and the quietness of the subway yards while hearing the gunshots right outside the subway yards, somebody's life is ending right now and I'm painting. It was a weird feeling. There was a sense of urgency. We were painting in rapid session because we didn't want to get killed and people thought the crime wave was conducive with what was going on on the trains, the subway painting. You know, these young people are opening the floodgates to a wave of crime, couldn't be... more wrong. There were no other options on the plate and if you was a very creative person and you was immersed in this... this city that was falling apart, you know, it was a miracle that we were... we took that vehicle and we made it into a conceptual work of art. I knew that I was working with... with other artists and I was creating art and, uh, that's what kept my... my candle lit. You know, it was a movement for the times... but I knew that Jean... was not one of the writers. He was never really a graffiti artist, you know, I mean, he was not part of the culture, you know. I mean, there was a way we dressed or how we spoke, he wasn't part of that. Well graffiti, I mean, anyone that's scribbling something on the wall, it becomes graffiti, you know, being black, and writing words, he's tagged as a graffiti artist, but that was his canvas, you know, he didn't really have a place to live, so if he wanted to create something he'd put it outside on the wall, right? I was coming down Ludlow and I ran into him and he goes, "Oh, Coleen, do you have a place to stay?" and I was like, "Ah, not really but if you want to crash on our floor, I've got... you know my boyfriend is there," and he was like, "Oh, you have boyfriend?" I was like, "Yeah." He goes, "Oh..." "No thanks," you know. He needed a place to stay and he was cute, right? And he was also, um, so charismatic and interesting, that he was magnetic. It was hard to... not want to be around. I mean I have vivid memories of us sitting on my stoop. We would often be sitting there smoking joints, it was right next door to a... a flat tires fix joint, a lot of the old signage which was largely, I think Puerto Ricans and Dominican establishments in the neighbourhood, there was a lot going on there in the Puerto Rican culture. Jorge Brandon, you know, the Teatro Ambulante, spewed poetry like on a soap box right on the street. I mean, he would do funny things, like he would get up and take off, like he went to the Mudd Club and danced to like Sex Machine and then came back. He was famous for going into the bathroom, the girls bathroom at Club 57 and creating havoc. Everybody was crazy about him, you know, I mean it wasn't just me... everyone. But I was well aware I was never the only one. ♪ I'm a young barracuda Swimming in the deep blue sea ♪ When I met him, I went to a club and we partied all night. - Dancing and stuff... - And dancing, you know, - which is what we did. - Yeah. ♪ ...Baby and I'm starved For some of your love ♪ After leaving, and I was joking around and I said, "Oh, here's our ride," and I pretend to open this car door, real fancy car door, and the door opens, so I was like, "Oh my gosh," and I closed it right away. And then these two guys, Italian guys come out at us and go, "What were you doing in our friend's car?" And we're like, "Nothing. Nothing," and this guy throws me to the ground. One of the guys, like, did like that with a knife, like at my stomach, like swung, and I like, you know, moved back like that. I remember Jean coming out and coming upon this scene and, sort of, going after these guys and sticking up for us, and then we ran off. Yeah. People always didn't have a place to stay. "So, where you staying tonight?" "Well, I don't know," so, "Well, you can stay here." I went to bed, so I guess he found a place to sleep and he slept there and so then he started to stay from time to time. Alexis was living with me, and I had a small room in the front, and she was living with me in that small room, so Jean would crash in the living room. You know people would come by, you know, it was like this fluid thing, my friend Jennifer and stuff. If I had been out all night I'd ring her bell maybe four or five o'clock in the morning, pray to God she'd let me in, and she usually did, and I would get the couch. Jean was having issues at home, Jennifer was having issues at home, you know, but they could come to my house and we could just listen to music and hang out, and no one would be judging them. Jean-Michel took Felice's couch from me, I felt like that couch was mine and it led to some rivalry between us. We would just argue and chase each other around her apartment, she'd have to separate us. I think we were actually reliving our own experience with siblings at home... something that was very, very warm and familiar about him to me, like a brother or a cousin and that's how we worked that out. We loved each other, I mean we shared everything, clothes, food, money. We were family. You know Jean loved, like, industrial music, like, um, you know, Test Dept, and Einstürzende Neubauten and whatever. Boom boom, boom boom. And you know everyone used to carry boomboxes, right, so, everything else was carrying The Message or Grandmaster Flash and Jean was carrying, like, industrial noise. So he used to come into my building at three o'clock in the morning to stay there, blaring this industrial beat box and my super, Mr. Galzavez, he'd come out and say, "You motherfucker, turn that shit off, it's three o'clock in the morning. Fuck you," and Jean used to say, "Fuck you!" So, you know, I started to get a little more uptight, you know, and, uh, with the late-night scenes and the late-night arguments and it started to become me and them, you know like me in the back room and then... Alexis and Jean, you know, in the front room, and like Jennifer trying to find a place to be, so I told Alexis you have to go. Felice and I had that argument, we moved out of the house and... her house and we didn't speak which was huge for us 'cause we always speak. I'd still see Jean everywhere, I'd still see Alexis everywhere. We all were going to see the same bands, you know, and if there's only like, 40 people in the audience, you know, and you're like hating someone who's there, I mean that's no fun, is it? So, you know, we just... we just became friends again. And so I found this gold coat, and I just thought it was the coolest thing, and I knew she would love it because anyone would love it. It's a great coat, you know. You know, I was wearing this gold lamé coat down the street, feeling really good, brought it home. The next morning I wake up and it's painted... and it's painted really beautifully. Jean had painted all over it. I was like, "Oh, that's cool," you know, so it was great, it was like we all three became friends again. I found this place on 12th Street... and it was his first stable home, the first place he had a key to. Jean was about 18 and I was about 22. I never felt that he was my boyfriend but we did have sex, we enjoyed each other's company on a lot of fronts. He was discovering his own art form, having this apartment allowed him some possibility of working on that, developing it. The walls and floor were his canvas. In the living room there was this turntable and his art. Yeah, I remember him fiddling. Obviously, I didn't... you know, it wasn't him with a brush and easel, it was just him crazy gluing something onto something else. Jean would be making art the way we'd be smoking pot, you know we're having conversation, it was just like... it was just part of the stream of things that were going on in that house. Anything could be brought up from the street and take on a life of its own at the hands of Jean. They all did that. You know, I mean, you know, Jean-Michel did that, Keith was doing that, we were all hauling stuff out from the trash that was interesting and modifying it, and doing things to it, and going into abandon lots and creating little... ephemeral, kind of installations. And I guess he was doing all this writing too. Jean's writing and my writing at that time had an awful lot of overlap, you know, probably ...I don't know, we were reading William Burroughs and crime novels, you know. The important thing about Jean is he's not just a great visual artist, he's a great writer, and the words are as important as the visuals and this was a period when Jean was, uh, exploring the words, the writing. "Set, desk, Andy talking into red tape recorder on desk. Institutional drab office with some objects that indicate home. I was having cold sweat nightmares about being chased, so I became an alcoholic and now I'm an engineer. I retired at an early age to avoid embarrassment. Two stops later, I'm plagued by not having any money to go into diners and spread a rap as thin as margarine. I become good at petty crime. Now in the zenith of my life with my television best friends and six months down on my instalments. I think back to those times and a smile comes to my face. I'm scared to look at my x-rays. You should never have lived. Yeah, maybe not. It's really hot in here. You think I can get a ginger ale? You really gonna push it aren't you? Like some fat executive with a big expense account, eating Rolaids like candy. I'm running out of Brillo and I don't have any cucumbers left. All you can think about is yourself. This is my last day alive." Fade to black. This is poetry, you know, it's kind of got a narrative form, it resembles crime novels and crime movies, but he's using it like poetry, he's chopping it up like Burroughs, you know. You know, they call graffiti artists, writers... but are they poets? Yes and no. Are they writers? Yes and no. It's a different type of writing, it's more like what we say in the news media as sound bites, because originally, they were made for places where trains would go by, you'd have to see them in a flash, read them really quickly... so they had to have a quick eidetic bite. I was taught by virtue of what the group and what the movement was that it had to be just for the enclosed group, but I had exhausted everything that you could do in the underground, and I thought it was a time to turn the chapter. It was the first of its kind, it was the first full handball court mural, created by someone from the subways. I did it on my own, uh, under the cover of darkness again in an eight-ten hour window. The neighbourhood was completely blown away and the school was totally blown away. All the students were at those windows for two to three weeks. It was such a monumental feat that even other artists were in awe that it was done. They felt the vulnerable state that I felt. How was he able to apply this imagery with this little bit of time on a non-moving object in front of everyone's eyes and I think people needed to go and do these visitation rights and even Keith was like, "Wow, how'd you do it?" I was like, "You just get a ladder." And that was the point of time where I had arrived as an artist. I felt something different from the subways. The subways are sort of like very intrusive you know, they came to the audience, but here we are at a wall where people came to the wall, and they had to, um, now question themselves why they were at that wall and what was it that kept them at that wall, and pretty much instigated thoughts about art and placement and where should art be. Uh, this is now the running legs that this movement deserves. This is my proclamation that this is an art. This is an art form and if you're gonna point fingers at me, I'll stay around long enough to keep the light on for you when you do come to your senses. Because the art world had no sense of what was going on. It wasn't common to bring out your thoughts about it because it was such a young movement and it was so radical and so fleeting. Soho, a lot of those galleries, kind of, had their stable of artists. They weren't actively looking for not just... not new artists, but for a whole different project. You know Leo Castelli, Ileana Sonnabend, you'd pass these places and occasionally, you know, you might still be interested in some of those old artists, you know. Might still want to go see a Rosenquist or a Rauschenberg show, so you'd go in, but the galleries just seemed like... they were like banks or something. We'd followed this modernist thing, and Soho kind of left us with minimalism at that point. People were making art with index cards and Polaroid photographs and writing on walls and... and it did get to be a little academic. It wasn't just graffiti that was being ignored by the art world, but young artists in general. In many ways, uh, the eruption of graffiti inspired a lot of younger artists to take control over that situation on their own terms, and form their own groups, their own gangs, like COLAB, which was more, uh, inspired by the '70s DIY of punk rock. One, two, three, four! We were part of the street, the street was, what was happening, so, don't wait around for some gallery to show interest in you, just do it. COLAB was this group of 40 to 60 downtown artists all around the same age, and everybody wanted to do something as a group, have shows, have magazines, have live cable television shows. People were like really sort of angry at the galleries and the establishment of the art so because of that we sort of went, okay well, we'll do this collective and we'll show ourselves and we'll show other people that don't get shown. We didn't have to wait to be appointed or anointed to be in the art world, we could just be the art world. The artists wanted to make something that was a statement politically about the time of being, sort of, everyone who was disenfranchised. Soho could have the old left and you could have Lucy Lippard and Hans Haacke, and people like that getting together and talking about their field trips to Nicaragua and the march of, kind of, uh, Imperial America. The rest of us were kind of going but I just stepped over a body to get here, where is the actual address about what's going on in New York. They kind of just went forward with their ideologies or projects and their aesthetics, but they couldn't quite fathom the real slippage, uh, in terms of cultural traction that was happening. The immediacy of the art that was going on downtown, the... you know, the COLAB stuff, all their theme shows, that was alive. Diego said I want to do this Batman show, he had a lot of people come and bring Batman stuff. There was this little kid and he had all these like really tiny like little drawings and they were really great, very like... stick figures and I think that's when Jean-Michel really started coming in more to look at the art. He would just come in and look at the artwork and then asked me questions about, "Who did this, who did that?" You could tell he was like, "This is good, this is not." You know, like, really well informed, right? Knew his history, knew his political history... and it's interesting that he didn't bring in any drawings for it, because it was... the shows were open, right, he could've brought stuff in to any of those shows. I think also Jean-Michel, saw like yes, it's very political, but also these people are not making any money, and they're not getting anywhere, right? ♪ ...Thumping into my gut Soldier soldier... ♪ One of the first really powerful, important gestures COLAB created was in 1979. They took over a building on the south side of Delancey Street, with the idea that... why are we dealing with homelessness, why are we dealing with people not having anything proper to live and survive in, when we have all these buildings that are empty? And the show opened basically, New Year's Eve... and come New Year's Day 1980, the police shut down the show. There were figures like Joseph Boyce, going, "No, you cannot do this, you can't shut artists out of the ability to show their work. You can't shut down these voices of dissent and activism." It became a big news story and in many ways a lot of other artists who weren't as familiar with what COLAB was trying to do became attracted to them, to that kind of energy to what they could manifest. It's gradually gotten bigger, but you know, not at a huge scale, you know the crossover finally got started for COLAB. Certainly it was not lost on Jean-Michel. We had, uh, bumped into each other on the street one day and we just ended up hanging out for the rest of the day, and dropping some acid and staying up all night on the street. At one point, he did turn to me and say that he knew that he was gonna be very famous. "I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be a superstar. I'm gonna be famous. I'm gonna be a famous artist," and we used to be like, "Okay Jean, you know, cool," you know. Being ambitious in terms of your art was what we all had in common. It was sort of about being a rock star even if you didn't play an instrument. Basquiat is like, pretty ambitious, right, I mean, he always would go where somebody was doing something and want to, sort of be part of it, without saying he wanted to be part of it. It is theCanal Zone and it's happening here and now. If you're lost, you can find yourself right here, right now in theCanal Zone. One day, looking in theVillage Voice, I noticed this little blurb that was about Fabulous 5. They would come to your space and do giant graffiti burners for a fee. Well, I decided, let me call this guy up, I'd never met Fab 5 Freddy before, I called him and we talk about doing events and projects and what came up was this idea of doing a party in which we would show the work of the Fab 5, the graffiti artists, where what would later be called hip-hop, street, you know, graffiti art world, would meet the downtown, fine art world of New York. There was one person that came uninvited was Jean-Michel Basquiat. I was well aware of the punk rock scene at the time and so people that were close to punk and also new wave were doing interesting things to themselves visually like with the hair, and so when I saw Jean-Michel it was clear, like, he was connected to that sensibility. That's how I remember, uh, meeting him at thisCanal Zone, uh, party on Canal Street. He shows up, sees these giant pieces by the Fabulous 5 and says, "I want to do a piece too," and all of a sudden, we're like, "Woah, this is SAMO." Everyone knew SAMO's pieces, these genius pieces of poetry, I mean all these brilliant SAMO tags and poems. But nobody knew who it was, it was a mystery. He understands already at this point that he wants to be a famous artist, he already knows how to be a famous artist, he showed up at that party as part of his to do list to become a famous artist. He knew to show up at this party. And then when he saw the video cameras, he knew he had to be on video, and this is a time when we really weren't doing a lot of video interviewing. SAMO, S-A-M-O, come on, you've seen it on the walls, especially down in the village. This gentleman right here is SAMO. Soon after the interview, you know, I sought Jean out, because I didn't know who he was, I'd never met him, never really even said hello to him before the interview. He goes, "Do you want to start a band?" And I'm like, "Yeah!" And that's how Gray started. So the Canal Zone party was super important at the time. It was the first time that SAMO was revealed, Jean-Michel and I started our band Gray, it was also the first time hip-hop was experienced by the downtown art scene. You know, so it was people like myself and Fab 5 Freddy bringing these artists downtown and then rubbing shoulders with the downtown art scene artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and everybody else. Um, uh, really put... really helped put hip-hop on the map. ♪ Party people, party people ♪ ♪ Can y'all get funky? Just hit me ♪ ♪ Just taste the funk and hit me ♪ ♪ Just get on down and hit me ♪ ♪ Bambaataa's gettin' So funky, now, hit me ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ As the idea of hip-hop now is becoming a thing amongst the downtown world, these people are all partying together. I had met all the key players in the rap music scene from the Bronx, Bambaataa, Flash, Grand Wizard Theodore, Busy Bee and all these guys. When I curated the exhibit at the Mudd Club, "Beyond Words" I got a bunch of them to come and perform. This was like a graffiti based, rooted and inspired exhibit that I curated in the third floor of the Mudd Club. And people came out the woodwork and a lot of people were like, "Oh my God, I love this new energy, all this new music." Afrika Bambaataa was excited to come and play for a different kind of audience, young, white, new-wave, punk rock kids. Those experiences, Bam says, inspired him to make "Planet Rock" which is a record that changed the whole face of dance music. I was turning Jean on to the, like, early hip-hop party tapes, this is before rap records really are coming out. The Cold Crush Brothers, Grandmaster Flash and the guys, you know, this is from street parties in the Bronx. We were becoming closer friends and we, you know, really connected with music, I mean, I'm telling him, like, hey man, you know this guy Max Roach who's this noted drummer from the bebop scene is my godfather. I grew up listening to this music all the time, in fact, I had just brought one of my first jazz records, "Jazz at Massey Hall" and I'm turning Jean on, and we're playing this music really loud and dancing and laughing and making art. Charlie Parker and Dizzy had been having a little beef when they played this particular show, and so Charlie Parker introduces the song, he goes, "I'd like to play a tune written by my worthy constituent Mr. Dizzy Gillespie, I sincerely hope you do enjoy, Salt Peanuts." When each one of these guys, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie takes their solo, they're playing at blistering speed each trying to outdo each other. So it was like they were having a battle with their instruments, which I found, like fascinating, and it was similar to what early rappers and early DJs, they would battle as well, like who's the best, like, in their craft, and I remember explaining that to Jean, Jean was really excited about those stories, he was like, "Wow man, tell me more, tell me more." It must have been not more than a few weeks later, I went by to visit Jean and he was really absorbing all of this bebop music. Obviously Jean was very aware that artists were gonna be in bands and musicians wanted to make art and, you know, I mean Jim was in The Del-Byzanteens, you know, and James Nares was... was in The Contortions. The way we made music was the same as the way we made films, which was just, you know, pick up the camera and do it, pick up the guitar and do it. A lot of people were looking for a way out and noise... and oblivion and drugs... were... completely in line with everything else we were doing. I think when I first heard Gray they were still called Test Pattern. It had this sort of quiet at the center of it... in the same way that, like Miles Davis' like earliest electric stuff did. It just seemed really futuristic... and homemade at the same time. It just had a free jazz feel. Jean was clearly the leader of the band, and again keep in mind, I'm like five years older than he is, right. I mean I'm supposed to be the wiser one. I mean no, that's not the case. It was certainly democratic in that, you know, the way we wrote music, and in many other things. I actually was in charge of our stage set and design. I saw them play a bunch of places, like one university and Mudd Club was kind of the most memorable 'cause they actually built like a crazy, sort of, Russian constructivist set. I remember they built this like metal frame on stage and Jean I think was in a box and he came up out of this box and... I had this idea to... create this ignorant geodesic dome, made out of scaffolding and lumber and garbage, in which I put all my drums and me. And all you could see from the audience was my head. Above me, Wayne Clifford and Vince Gallo, strapped in at 45 degree angles inside this jungle gym. And then Nick Taylor is so high up in the set design, all you could see was him from the knees down. Jean shows up at sound check and the thing's built. He turns around and walks right out. Five minutes later, Jean returns with this shipping crate with Chinese characters written on it, walks up to the stage, tosses this wooden cube onto the stage, Jean scrunches his body up and squeezes his body into this cube, he pulls his little wasp synthesizer in with him, and his clarinet and looks out at me and smiles. And I realized that in five minutes, without knowing what we were doing, he goes out into the streets, into the alleys around the Mudd Club and finds this wooden crate... that not only works perfectly with the design... but has made him the centre of attention. And I was like, "You motherfucker." I remember David Byrne being there, and Chris and Debbie Harry from Blondie, it was like people came out the woodwork to see them play, it was really exciting. The Mudd Club was incredible. And I think that's where the art world got its running legs, you know, there was a whole new attitude and atmosphere being ushered into the art world via through those clubs. If we think 1979, 1980, you have two clubs in particular that aren't just places where artists go, they're kind of clubhouses. And they come up with a, kind of, groupthink, in their own way. One would be Club 57 and the other would be the Mudd Club. They're quite similar, and quite different. Club 57 was, okay we're gonna create a miniature golf course... in the bar and then we're gonna give it a reggae theme and it will be the putt-putt golf course. It was an incredibly exciting space, every single night was a completely different theme. ♪ Can I have a taste of your ice cream? ♪ The Club 57 regulars, I'd say we were a lot more obnoxious. We'd be on psychedelics, bouncing around the walls, screaming. Even though Jean would hang out there, I think he had a little like, "You guys are a little too silly for me." He didn't really take part in our shenanigans. ♪ Can I lick the crumbs from your table ♪ ♪ No ♪ But eventually, most of the Club 57 kids were hired to work at... at the Mudd Club. ♪ No, mind your own business ♪ The Mudd Club was cool, it was way hipper, a lot of great bands played there. The B-52s, Talking Heads, and James White and the Blacks, and all those cats playing, you know, it's like, "Oh, whoa, what a smorgasbord of all these different temperatures." The most, kind of, interesting people of that generation, kind of acting the coolest that they could. You could say the difference was, everyone at Club 57 was taking mushrooms and everyone at Mudd Club was taking heroin. Pot, coke... Quaaludes. You couldn't go to the after after after hours clubs unless you had had some coke somewhere along the line, I mean... it was just... it was... everywhere. The sort of downsides was... of running a club is that the Mafia started moving in. There was a period where there's lots of free coke and then suddenly it all disappeared and then it was replaced by this other white substance, which they offered for free for, like, maybe a month, a couple months. If downtown had been gutted of its economic base there were hardly any businesses left. There was one incredibly lucrative... - uh, thriving business which was cocaine and heroin. With cocaine, you had a fair amount of denial, people thinking that it just made them more successful, and heroin with a whole... well, maybe self-denial, but a whole lot of, uh, mythologies attached to it. Heroin, heroin, heroin, heroin. William Burroughs Naked Lunch. It was definitely considered a rite of passage for a lot of the young guys who thought it would give them some type of a... pathway into a deeper creativity and there were so many people that people admired who had done heroin that, it was part of the culture. And it wasn't just the artists who were doing drugs. In our neighbourhood if you like, kind of, stayed up all night and you were coming home in the early hours in the morning you would see already the big heroin spots, lines of town cars because it was all the Wall Street people getting their heroin before they went to work. Isolation with a vengeance, it's like the valley of death. The paraphernalia associated with it, it was so medical. It should've been clinically administered in a hospital setting, there was no joy to it. You know I'm still in wonder of why people escape while they're escaping. I was very happy to be painting, 'cause I felt like I was doing something really fantastic. Why would I want to be in another headspace to not experience this in its rawness? It just was very foreign to me, and I saw a lot of lives being taken right before my eyes. You know some of these venues were celebrated because of the drugs that they had inside of them, and people still remember them to this day, but when you think about it, they were actually little igloos where people went and destroyed their lives. He was intelligent... you know he came to conclusions based on... his philosophies, most people don't have any philosophies, they're just walking around. And you know he was thinking up all these angles... correctly. He was giving himself these different brands, "I'm no longer SAMO, SAMO is dead." And then, you know, when he did the clothes he called it Man Made. He was clever. As he might have said, "I can paint clothes for you, I could paint on clothes," and I might have said, "All right, paint on clothes, that sounds like an idea." When Jean had his painted sweatshirts in the windows of Pat Fields store on 8th Street and I remember looking at them going, "Who's gonna buy these?" 'Cause they just looked so... fucked up. The aesthetic was so... rough. I don't know if they sold at the time, but I do remember the impression that I had from looking at them. At that point I had ordered these paper jumpsuits. I said, "You could paint on these, I have... I can get a bunch of these for you." ♪ ...Baby, jukebox baby... ♪ I personally found it inspiring... entertaining, interesting... and I responded to it because it wasn't, like, mass-produced stuff. Beyond the gallery system, artists were looking at other ways of, kind of, inserting their art into public consciousness. The shop windows had been this, kind of, other voice going on in our culture, especially with Bonwit Teller, where you have Salvador Dali working there as far back as the '30s, and certainly with the early Johns and Rauschenberg through Warhol. I think what Basquiat understood was the nature of public space. He was really interested in how he could get his art out into this public place in a way that, uh, could have durability and autonomy. There was another, uh, wonderful artist working at the same time in the East Village, Greer Lankton, and she was doing all the windows for Einsteins. It might have been his suggestion to have a show in my store, but whatever it was, it was a good idea and it happened. Before he had any gallery or anything like that, and he came in with about seven pieces, there was a men's suit jacket, then there was a typewriter, and there was, I don't know, some other electrical, electronic thing. And I said to him, "Okay, if people want to buy them, how much do you want for them?" And he was like, "Well, this one 10,000 and that one 20,000," and I was like, "Jean-Michel..." "I don't think... I think that's a little bit high." But he said, "No," and I said, "Fine, you want the 10,000, I'll say 10,000, it's your deal." But that was Jean-Michel. We took the show down, I had somebody working for me at the time, and he called Jean-Michel and he said, "I'm getting a new apartment and if I could have them in my house, all my friends can come and see them," and so on and so forth, and after two months or three months, whatever, he didn't pay his rent. They padlocked his apartment and they threw all the contents in the dumpster. I was like... "Oh, my God." He was at that time into Man Made, 'cause he had a coat on that was sort of abstract painted and it had Man Made with a copyright. He took me one time to Soho because he had postcards he wanted to sell. Actually me, Keith and Jean were making these colour Xerox, um, collages, postcards. There was that store, Rocks In Your Head, they had my colour Xerox postcards, they had Jean-Michel's. He's really playing a lot with collage and Xeroxing and that collage work would oftentimes necessitate him going to copy shops and that almighty colour copier. It was a big part of his visual voice. Xerox machines had been around in general circulation since the late '60s, but they were really terrible until around the mid-70s. Suddenly they start being able to reproduce on plain paper with a fair amount of detail. Suddenly xerography made the whole band flyer revolution possible, and associated forms of art, and zines, you know, zines started happening around the same time. You know a lot of people were using collage work downtown in the... in the punk days, so he was inspired by that. These experiments with the photocopier, which became a large part of the paintings, when he slaps the photocopied images all over, glue them on. One time he came in and he said, "Oh, Andy Warhol bought one of my postcards," and we were like, "Wow, man, that's great." We were so happy for him. I was like, "What? You actually talked to him, and you actually sold something to him?" It was like a very pivotal point, like you made that connection to, like, our hero. Everyone was in some way... brought to the city by... the kind of visage of their heroes. You couldn't deny that we'd all heard about The Factory and we'd all read Andy's books and things like that. This is fundamental to that generation because Warhol, by that time, by the art world standards, he was so passé and so tacky, he was considered pretty low at that point in his career. Kenny Scharf and Keith Herring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and... and a whole generation of people, Andy was still their hero. I found Andy Warhol to be like a really exciting artist because he worked in these different mediums. Andy was surrounded by music and he was working in film and doing all these different things that I saw that they are interrelated. He seemed to be having really a lot of fun and a good time while making art. Jean-Michel would agree because he was a favourite of ours, we'd both talk about all his... the things that he was doing. He represented... uh, what an artist could be. The creative process is transferable. It doesn't need to be... I'm a visual artist... she's a writer, he's a musician... they make films. The creative process, it can cover the whole shebang of it. The thing that Jean and I were both in agreement on, is, like the Malcolm X quote, "By any means necessary," Jean had a copy of that poster I remember at his house and I... and I went out and bought one too. You know Jean was like, "Yo, whether it's music, whether it's acting, film, painting, it's gonna happen, we're gonna do whatever," and I was like, "Yes, absolutely." That was I think... part of that was the Warhol influence, that you could work in these different mediums and it was all good. Hi, and welcome to TVParty, the TV show that's a cocktail party but which could be a political party. Thank you very much. Oh! There he is, standing in the back, Jean de New Orleans. What had been happening was, um, through both of our relationship with Glenn O'Brien, Glenn was also one the editors of High Times Magazine and Glenn was like, "Hey man, I'm gonna write a story about what you guys are doing," and that story focused on myself, Lee Quiñones and Jean-Michel. The issue had just come out and Jean said, "Yeah man, um, come by my house tomorrow." This was Alexis' apartment that Jean was crashing at. It was one of those classic New York things where you have to yell up 'cause there's no doorbell working on the building. "Yo, Jean, Jean-Michel, SAMO," and Jean woke up. He put the key in a sock, and balled it up and threw it out. He had a few sketchbooks, scribble scrabble, paint splattered everywhere, and here's this magazine and Jean had a copy and there's photos of me and Lee, and talking about what we were doing and the scene that we were kind of helping create. I was just really excited and Jean was like, "Yeah man, it's a good thing, man, but... but it's just one article man, it's just one article." I remember going like, "Wow!" Like he was so, like, confident that, "Yeah, there'll be more." And I remember the thing that really struck me was, on the door of the refrigerator it said, "grape jelly," He's like, "Yeah man, I just did... I just did that man, I think it's still wet." And I was like, "Grape jelly?" It looked like somebody had literally taken grape jelly and smeared it and like smeared it with his fingers, it was just so funny. It was strange to me because it had nothing to do with style, he was like the anti-style. And at that time I would never want my work to drip and he was like into letting it drip. He was into letting art be itself and that's why his work was very, you know, crude and maybe childlike in some ways because, you know, when a child is drawing, there's no... there's no holdings, you know, you're not being held back by anything, you're just going by... spirit of the moment... and that in itself made for speed, rapidness. We were painting in rapid session because we didn't want to get caught, but Jean was doing it because he felt and probably knew that he only had a limited amount of time and in that urgent moment in his life I don't think he knew he was gonna die, but I think the passing of the moment was very frightening to him. To not have an idea to get created, you know life and... and art is very fleeting and, uh, he was very much afraid of that and I think that's what kept his wheels turning faster than everybody else. He pretty much abandoned that... that collage style at least within the context of the baseball cards, Pez cards, to go deeper into a drawing style in which now he's going back and incorporating figurative work in with this text. So he was moving from words into something that was pictorial and you really see that evolution as you look at those things on pieces of paper, they seem like they're writing, but, uh, slowly but surely, they're turning into images. I think it's very interesting, his association between language and, you know, media and television and radio and what you hear and music, and that was all integrated and collaged into this visual representation of something. Most of his stuff comes from cartoons and bad movies and a lot of his stuff is kind of spoofing textbooks. My chemistry and biology books, he studied those, you can definitely see the chemical compounds, graphs... and charts. He always was sampling anything with diagrams or... or pictures. He would, uh, lift and make them his own. The thing about Jean-Michel was taking things from everywhere and if they move you, they become part of you, and then you can put them back out. He's like a filter. It was like living in a gallery and it was constantly changing, it was always exciting to wake up in the morning and see what had happened. Alexis' refrigerator door was a Basquiat, I think her bathroom door was a Basquiat. He was definitely developing his language and his symbols. It was pretty amazing to see him becoming the artist that he... he did become. Diego showed me some of his drawings, by '79, like towards the Times Square Show. Diego Cortez was like a curator who had this new wave connection. He got it, Diego, so he worked with Jean, I know. Well, I met him, maybe in 1979 or something. He told me about doing graffiti on the streets and uh, I never saw the SAMO graffiti for months and months and months. Finally after knowing him just socially at the Mudd Club, I ran into one of those graffiti works, then I made a little meeting with him, said I wanted to work with him. I mean the first time I saw his graffiti, I said to him, you know, literally... I mean, it's like a scene out of a bad movie, I said, "You know, you're going to be as big as Andy Warhol." I think he probably spotted him early on as very important and someone to promote and watch. I think that he probably made the connection between Jean and Henry. Diego was a pivotal character in all of this, absolutely. Diego, you know, it was him that took me to the Times Square Show, uh, because he knew the people at COLAB that organized the show. Do you suffer from agoraphobia? So do I. To be or not to be, another night around the palace of exotic landlordism or going out... to the Times Square extravaganza, on 41st Street. ♪ There's a new sun Rising up angry in the sky ♪ ♪ There's a new voice Crying we're not afraid to die ♪ ♪ Let the old world make believe ♪ ♪ It's blind and deaf and dumb ♪ Nineteen eighty, there was this big exhibit, it was the front-page Village Voice cover story, the first radical art show of the '80s. The Times Square Show was kind of the first survey of... of the underground. It actually opened June 1st, 1980 and it went seven days a week, 24 hours a day, in an abandoned massage parlor. Well, they called it a massage parlor back then, but essentially that was a whorehouse. Art everywhere, Jane Dickson, a number of other artists were involved. There must've been 75 artists in the show, including performance artists and filmmakers. Charlie Ahearn, Freddy Brathwaite and Lee came up with the idea to make Charlie Ahearn's film Wild Style, while they were hanging out at the Times Square Show. It starred Lee Quiñones. Jeffrey Deitch showed up, Barbara Gladstone showed up, Brooke Alexander showed up, they were all gallery dealers. A lot of people got started in the Times Square Show that basically, hadn't had galleries before. And that's where I met Keith... and Kenny. About a week after that, that's when Keith started his chalk drawings in the subway. So for Keith, that made a huge impact, meeting Freddy and Lee. Jean made a piece, he had to install something on the walls. I do remember a painting that he just whipped out on a wall somewhere and you know, like everything he did, it just had this amazing energy that would emanate from the lines. I remember a write-up in Art in America about the Times Square Show and they mentioned SAMO and they were really impressed with this painting he had done on the wall. He goes yet through another transformation in which, now he's using oil stick, using crayon on, uh, different forms of art paper, but he's maintaining and holding onto that childlike hand, which I think personally, I mean this is just coming from me, is... is his signature. So after the Times Square Show had happened, Diego was determined to do his own show which would happen a year later, called, New York New Wave, which would feature myself, Lee, and several other people that had came from the subway graffiti world, as well as a lot of photography and other paintings, and it was a huge blockbuster exhibit. The line was massive to get into this exhibit. The first artwork I saw of his was in the show that Diego put together at P.S. 1, when it was... beginning to become what he did. There were shows like little pictures of a car crash. Jean-Michel with his work... had an effect on everybody that saw it, particularly the artists. The writing, and the visuals, he had figured out how to bring it all together. I mean we'd already... none of us were surprised, I mean he was the one person that all the artists were talking about as being really interesting and really great and doing all this stuff. That's where the first, you know, big Basquiat publicity came from 'cause his stuff looked so great. Yeah, that first show was, what... put him suddenly into... orbit. I remember I saw Jean at an after-party and he was sitting at a bar, I remember him saying, "What's your next movie, what's your next movie idea, what's it gonna be?" And I was like, "I'm not sure, I have a few ideas." And he said, "If you want to hang out sometime and just talk about your ideas or tell them to me, man, I'd love that, you know, I love just hearing ideas, you know, I'd love to know what you're thinking." Said, "Man, maybe you can hang out sometime." And then immediately he was... shortly thereafter, swarmed by a bunch of people. From mid 1980 through spring of 1981 or summer of 1981, his works were mostly small and then the work started to be larger. Henry Geldzahler went down to a studio that Jean-Michel had just at the entry of the Brooklyn Bridge, and he'd made the first painting that he ever made really, um, and Henry went to the studio, he saw it, he bought it for 500 dollars, brought it home, he had it hanging in his apartment and he was giving me a lecture that this guy was as good as early Rauschenberg. Now, I mean, here's an artist... he's... it's his first painting, he's only made it the day before, Henry's already bought it, he's got a hanging in his house next to David Hockney and Ellsworth Kelly and Jasper Johns and... and I didn't argue with him because he clearly was. You just knew it, I mean Jean just had it. And then at a certain point, he just took off and you knew he was not coming back. ♪ Dream baby dream ♪ ♪ Dream baby dream ♪ ♪ Dream baby dream ♪ ♪ Dream baby dream ♪ ♪ Forever ♪ I'm so honoured to have known him at all, you know.
