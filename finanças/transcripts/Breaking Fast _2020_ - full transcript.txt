Thank you. Hi, I'm back. Sorry it took so long. The line was crazy. We're all in here. I didn't miss it, did I? Alhamdulillah. They almost ran out. I got the last tray. They're still pretty warm, so don't heat them too long. And leave the attar on the side. Hassan doesn't like it on top. - He likes to dip it. - Okay. Not my recipe. Uh, where's Hassan? - Hi. - Hi. Yallah, five minutes until Iftar. And I got fresh Kanafeh for dessert. Ugh, the line was so long. Mo, I, uh... You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah. Something's wrong. Tell me. Let's just do this another time. Okay? Uh, your family is here, and... It's the last Iftar. I know how important that is to you. Plus, I hear there's fresh Kanafeh. Hassan. My cousin threatened to out me today. This again? And what did she say this time? Uh... She, uh... She found my secret Facebook profile. Yeah. And she said it was her Islamic duty to tell my dad. And has she? I don't know. I've been calling him and texting all day. He hasn't been responding. Hmm. Yeah. This could kill him. That's a bit over-the-top. Plus, you're not married and practically 80 in Arab years. Do you really think people don't know by now? Mo, I'm serious. I'm scared. I don't know if he can recover from something like this. Did you delete your profile? Yes, of course, I deleted my profile. Then why don't you do what you always do? Tell him it isn't true, gossip is haram, and you plan on getting married soon. Problem solved! Yallah, Kanafeh time! No. It's... It's more serious than that this time. I need to be able to talk to him in person, so I booked a flight home tomorrow morning. Wait a second. - No. Just don't do that thing. - What thing? That thing you do where you hijack my plan and you turn it into yours. Please don't say "hijack" to a Muslim. Could you not make a joke right now, please? I don't know how many times I have to explain it to you, but my dad is not your dad. I need you to respect that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know... Humor is one of my coping mechanisms. And there are worse fathers in the world than yours, you know. I can't just keep saying I'm talking to some girl, or that I'm planning on getting married. I have to actually do something. You could come out. Inshallah, eventually maybe. Hmm. Or I could get married. It would just be for show. It wouldn't mean anything. It would to me. Mo... We know a lot of guys with this kind of arrangement. But we make fun of those guys. Well, you had to know that something like this was bound to happen. I never thought this would happen. This makes no sense. I mean, this isn't our plan. What are you even saying? Do you hear yourself? I do, but I don't know if you hear me. You can't be serious. Habibi, I'm not saying I have it all figured out. I just need a little time to go home and assess the situation. Do I get a say in any of this? I'm just asking you to be patient with me. I wouldn't be doing this unless I absolutely had to. You know that, right? I told you I didn't want to talk about this now. Yallah, your family is waiting. All right. Are you guys ready? Let's go! In four, three, two, one! All right, everyone, grab a partner. Let's go! Hey! Khalas, I'm in a zone! Yeah, the Twilight Zone. Plus, who are you trying to impress? I call dibs on the DJ. Switch! Not my type. Plus, I'm pretty sure he's a minor. No one is your type these days. When you gonna snap out of this horrible funk you've been in? It's been nearly a year. All right, everybody. Up, up, up! Let's kick the shit out of those fat cells. Four, three, two, one! Funk? No funk here. There are no funks given. Please don't forget that you're speaking to your best friend here, and not one of your patients. - I'm just worried about... - Worried about what? I'm worried about your BV. I think maybe this is the year you could give it up. "BV"? Butt Virginity, ya huh! Don't worry, it's still completely intact. That's the problem. Why are you so obsessed with my sex life? What sex? What life? All right, everybody. Abs on the floor, let's go! Abs! Abs! Abs! Don't let last year define who you are this year. Start new. Start fresh. You deserve it! As long you don't forget about Wednesday. Wednesday? - The first night of Ramadan! - My birthday! Obliques! You promised you'd come to my party. God, where is your head lately? Sam, it's the first night of Ramadan. - Ah ah ah ah. - You know I like to... That's not my fault. It's my birthday, and I'm not celebrating it without my best friend. Allah will understand. Fine. There she is. Just don't get mad if I leave early. I would expect nothing less. He reached out on WhatsApp. I thought you blocked him. I guess I forgot to on WhatsApp. - So? - So, what? I blocked him on WhatsApp. Mo, maybe it's time to talk to him. And say what? He didn't listen to me then, so why should I listen to him now. Ya Allah, you are so stubborn. He's married. She's probably pregnant, and he wants to tell me he's naming the baby after me, which would be so weird. You literally have the most common name in the world. it wouldn't be that weird. Yeah. Okay, habibi, I'll catch up with you later. Um, hello? You're my ride. Take a Lyft or something. I have to, um... Something just came up. Unbelievable. Nurse Harper. How many lives you save today? Quit watching so much damn Grey's Anatomy. Now, get to your patients. Info nurse's station, Harper here. Ms. Bazzi. Hey, Doc. Hi, how are you doing today? You have reached the mailbox of... Hello. I cannot talk. Please leave a message. Please leave a message after the beep. Hi Tata. Day one. Ramadan Mubarak. You'll be happy to know for the first Iftar I'm making Fattoush and using exactly one-and-a half lemons as instructed. Oh, this house smells so good. I wish you could see these manaeesh. I tried your secret. This is always my favorite time of the year. The food, the no working out, but it won't be the same without you here or Mama and Baba. I'll be fine, Inshallah. Sam's party is tonight, but trust me, I'd much rather stay in. I mean, I want to be there for him, but, I don't know... I just... How many times are we gonna celebrate Sam's 25th birthday? Hold on one second, Tata. Ah, Tata. Thank you. I'm just not in the mood to be around happy people. If only I were a balloon. That probably made no sense. Anyway, I love you, Tata. Thank you. Ahhh! Ho-Mo! Gay-rab! You made it! Happy birthday! Best surprise party ever. Aw! Mwah, mwah, mwah! Yeah, let's go. Everyone, Mo's here! Please! You promised not to make a scene. Oh, that's right. That's right. Never mind, Mo's not here. - Sam! - Carry on! No more shenanigans, I promise. Here, put these in water. Thanks. I'm so glad you're here, habibi. Just try to have fun, okay? Oh, thank you! Here you go. Just take it. Here you go. Here we go. Bye! Is there a gospel choir here? ♪ Oh, yeah! ♪ So, I've developed a little bit of a red area on my inner thigh. It's not quite a rash, but it's probably not a bite either. I don't know if it's because we changed lubes recently or what, but it's really starting to itch and burn. Have you ever had that? Anyway, I don't know what to do, 'cause I feel it's starting to turn Andrew off, and I really don't want him to cheat on me. It's probably herpes, and Andrew probably gave it to you. I'm so sorry about Andrew's herpes. Slice of cheese? Oh, my God! It is over, Andrew! - Hey. - Hey, how's it going? I think it's time for me to head home, habibi. But John hasn't come yet. We haven't even had cake. Who's John? Settle down. He's for me, not for you. But I want you to meet him. Sam, you promised. Happy birthday! John, habibi! Thank you! Oh, John, this is Mo, my best friend. Hi John. Nice to meet you. Hey buddy. And this is Kal. Val! How are you? Welcome. It's Kal, with a "K." Happy birthday! Thanks for letting me crash your party. Of course! The more the merrier. I don't know what this is, but I have a feeling I'm going to put it to good use. It's a bacon-shaped dildo, you little power bottom. - I so... I got you! - Oh, John. Hey, Where's the kitchen? I think I'm gonna grab a drink. Oh, uh, it... It's over there. I'll have a vodka cranberry, if you're pouring. Sure. Uh, Kal, anything? Uh, just the usual for me. Yeah. So, Kal, tell me everything. Sam. Status, go. Single? Taken? Open? Looking? I'm single. And you're funny. You know who else is single and funny? Mo, here, my best friend. We have been life-long friends for our whole lives. And, he's a doctor. Did I mention he's a single doctor? Oh, that's awesome! What kind? Oh, I'm a gastroenterologist with a specialty in hepatology. Essentially, I fix livers. Oh perfect, this party's filled with alcoholics. ♪ Happy Birthday, dear Sam ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Make a wish! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Say, uh, where's your bathroom? Oh, yeah, it's down the hall to the right. - Go after him! - To the bathroom? Oh you know what "bathroom" is code for. Guys don't talk to me in code. Plus, I told you, I'm not ready for any... Shu ready? I'm not talking soul mates, I'm talking sex! Plus, he hasn't taken his eyes off you all night. That's not true. Really? Round two. Hey, where'd Kal go? Oh, I... I don't know. Mo, can you go find Val and give this to him, please? - Really? - Yes, really. He looked thirsty. Otherwise, you're welcome to dance with John and me. I'll go find Kal. - Oh, okay. - Come on! Let's dance. Whoo! ♪ I'm peeing in the bathroom Talking to myself ♪ I'm peeing in the bathroom... ♪ - Kal? - Occupied. Hey, I have your drink. One second. Nice singing. Were you listening to me pee? Creep. Is that mine? No, of course not. Hey, uh, where'd you learn Arabic anyway? Jordan. My dad was in the Army. Oh, sorry. Thanks? - Oh, whoa, whoa. - Oops, my bad. Sorry. I don't know why I said that. Sorry. Here, here, here. Let me look at this. Smells like wine. You're lucky it was white. Excuse me. I'm just gonna jump in here real quick. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Can I... - You want me to just get my drink? - Yeah. Come on in, yeah. Go ahead. - Huh? - It's all yours. - Okay. - Thank you. Excuse me. Right. Please leave a message after the beep. Just wanted to say good night. Sam was in rare form. From a scale of one to Sam, he was at least a 12. Hey, creep! Are you leaving without saying goodbye? Hey, I was just... Wait, why are you sneaking up on me? I went out for some fresh air, and then I heard Sam dragged everyone to Fubar. So, I guess you could say my wing-man duties were successful. Do you want a ride home? Oh, this is just water. I don't drink. Me either. Okay. So, shall we? Oh, no, no. The fresh air will do me good. Well, which way are you headed? I've got to stop at the store, anyway. I'll walk with you. You don't have to do that. Plus, I don't want to know what you could possibly need at this hour. Gum. - Gum? - Yes, gum. I need gum. Just take a walk. It won't take long. Unless you'd rather not. Okay. You're not going to kill me, are you? Maybe. Depends. To be honest, I feel like a bit of an outsider in West Hollywood. What part of town do you live in? West Hollywood, but like, way, way down. I get it. It probably doesn't help that you don't drink. Probably. I've always hated the taste. You? Oh, I don't mind the taste. I've just learned that it's best if I steer clear. Are you in a program? Oh, my God, is that rude to ask? Totally cool if you are, or aren't. Either way. Never mind. Wow. That was pretty forward for someone who doesn't like Weho. Sorry. Sometimes I say what I'm thinking. Not that I was thinking that. I didn't mean to imply that. Kal? Oh, my God! Hey, whoa. - Take it easy. - How have you been? I haven't seen you out in, like, a minute. You're coming to my reading, right? Maybe. Uh, guys, this is Mo. Hey, guys. - Hi. - Hey. So, where are you headed? We're heading to Fubar. Come! Oh, my God, yes, come! I love Fubar. Oh, me too! There is nowhere I'd rather be. Okay, girl. Well, you know, we'll see you there I guess. You should've slept with him when you had the chance. - Who said I didn't? - He didn't. Friends of yours? Uh, sometimes this town feels way too small. Hmm. They actors? Yeah, how could you tell? They made me uncomfortable. Actors always make me uncomfortable. - Hey, I'm an actor. - Like I said... I'm just kidding. Whatever, creep! Whatever, girl! - Don't. - You don't. Deal. I bet you charm all the boys with trips to buy gum. Nah, just the cute ones. Flirt. Like, that was flirting, right? Now, this place, Thursday nights, even sober, that's a party. Oh, God, I could never. - What? Go out on a Thursday? - Exactly. No, I reserve my singing for the shower only. Audience of me. Oh, you should try it. It's fun. Life is so easy for guys like you. Guys like me? You know, the arms, the height, the endless options of well-worn tank tops. - Mega attractive guys have more... - I hate tank tops. Well, you know what I mean. What I know is that a gay, Arab, Muslim guy in Weho probably knows what it's like to have people make assumptions about him. They're generally incorrect, and they never feel good. You know, I have to work much harder to be taken seriously. But it's nice to know you think I'm mega attractive. - What? - That's what you said, right? Oh, here we are. I think it's gonna rain. We should grab an umbrella. Okay. Come on. So, is Mo short for Mohammed? It is. Is Kal short for... Wait, what is Kal short for? Kal-El. Khalil? No. Kal-El. Your full name is Kal-El? - Like Superman? - Yes. Like Superman's Kryptonian name given to him by his biological parents, Jor-El and Lara? Oh, Superman fan? Yeah! Huge! Do you have a favorite? Superman? Oh, Christopher Reeve, no contest. Agreed. I can never decide which movie I like more, the first movie or the second. Oh, definitely the first, but the battle scene at the end of the second is epic. Epic, totally! Favorite scene? Wait, let me guess. "Easy Miss, I've got you." "You... You've got me? Who's got you?" I think I just found my dad's soulmate. How did you know that was my favorite part? Isn't it everyone's? - This is my favorite part. - Huh? Fro-yo. Oh, yeah. Me too. - All right. - It's pouring out there. Sam seriously calls it BV? Mmm-hmm. Can I ask you what it is you're holding onto? Is it like a "never gonna happen" type thing, or a Muslim thing? Oh, no. It has nothing to do with any of that. I mean, the truth is, I don't even know if I want to. I mean, but if I do, I want it to be with someone special. And you haven't found someone special yet? No. It must be hard to find another good Muslim guy in this town. I think that's admirable. What do you mean? Well, you seem pretty Muslim, right? Like you practice? Hamdiallah, I try. That's really cool and rare. I mean, honestly, most people are turned off by the whole thing. Explaining my faith to people is kinda hard. I bet. I bet most Muslims would shun you for being gay, and most gays don't really get down with God. But you've found a way to reconcile the two? Have you ever seen The Sound of Music? The movie? Are you avoiding my question? Hear me out. You know when Maria returns to the convent, and tells Mother Abbess that she can't love the Captain because she's made a vow to God? Yes, I remember that part. Well, do you remember what Mother Abbess says to her? To climb every mountain? Well, yes. But before that she says, "If you love this man, "it doesn't mean you love God less." I was born gay and I love God. The two can and should totally be able to coexist. Hmm. You realize how gay you sound right now, right? Hey, come on. Kal! Oh, my God! So glad you're here. Okay, first of all. You're singing... Kal. Hey... Oh, my God. Go on in. Hello. I cannot talk. Please leave a message. Please leave a message after the beep. Hey, Tata. Headed home now. Didn't expect to be out this late on the first night of Ramadan. - Can I borrow some ketchup? - Huh? I tell those queens, "Extra ketchup," and they always say, "Okay, boo, whatever you want," like they're my best friend, and what happens when I reach into the bag? - No ketchup. - No ketchup! They're toying with me, but they'll see. Ugh! You want some? - Fasting. - Yeah me too. These are just fries though. How are you up this early? I haven't gone to bed yet. - Well? - Well what? You have nothing to say? Nothing happened. Yes, it did. No, it didn't. How do you know? You weren't even there. That makes no sense. Of course I was. We walked around all of West Hollywood for most of the night. - Who? - Me and Kal. You and Kal? Yeah, who'd you think? I was talking about John. John? I barely said two words to the guy. Not you and John. Me and John. Oh, what happened? Keep it macro please. I don't need details. No, no, no. Forget me and John. I want details. Juicy, dirty details. Don't make me pull teeth. Nothing happened. I walked him to buy some gum. Gum. That's what you're calling it? He went into Fubar. That's it. Didn't you see him there? Sharmout, my mother could've been dancing on a pole and I wouldn't have seen her. - So, nothing? No kiss? - No. - No phone number? - No. No plan to hang out again? Sam, I told you everything. We chewed gum and ate yogurt. Okay. Not every hot guy is just looking for sex, Sam. You make assumptions, but it's hard for guys like Kal to be taken seriously sometimes. I hear you. Nothing happened. We talked about Superman. We had fro-yo. Let's leave it at that and not jinx this thing that isn't even a thing. - So you are interested! - I'm not saying that. But you're not not saying that. So, there's hope! I told you there was life after Hassan. - Oh, sorry. - Not this again. Mo, it's been a year. And God knows, you're not getting any younger. - Sam, please. - That's it. I'm getting Val's phone number from John. I need an excuse to text him anyway. His name is Kal. With a "K." And don't you dare! Don't ever tell me "Don't" Mohammed! "Everybody says don't, everybody says..." Don't. Okay, now my turn. Pure thoughts only. I'm fasting. But these are pure. Purely haram. Anyway, we were both pretty drunk, - but I have the poppers... - I don't want to know. Prude. Yallah, I have to head to the hospital soon, I have a consult. Oh, it's fine. I gotta go meet the boys for Sunday Funday. It's Thursday. It's Weho. - Megan? Hey. - Mohammed? Hi, Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom. We got it. Okay. Thank you. Just heading to work. The driver is a woman. Mama, why are you so amped up? Are you hangry? Let him watch in peace. Say hi. I'm glad he's not fasting, he needs his medicine. I'll see you soon enough, Inshallah. Of course, every day. Guess who reached out this week? Hassan. After a whole year, he's still trying to contact me. Mama, don't talk like that! You will break your fast. Oh, I didn't. He is now blocked from all apps. Mom, you have two grandkids, and a third is on the way. Plus, I'm sure Allah has greater issues to deal with than my love life. Okay, Mom. I can't even deal with A, your racism, and B, with how you think me and my future husband, sent by God because of your prayers, are going to have full-blooded Arab babies? Okay, Mom, I just got to work. I will call you later. Mom, I gotta go. Mama, he's not depressed. You're just bored. Yallah, bye. Oh, bye. Oh, just my mom. Mo? Hey. Oh, my God, hey. What are you doing here? Did Sam reach out to you? I told him not to. I work here. Uh, Sam should have never... Oh, right, doctor. Right, right. Um, no, I was just thinking what a weird coincidence this is. Totally. But what are you doing here? I was just visiting someone. Really? Everything okay? No, yeah. Everything's fine. It's an overdue visit. Nothing major. Excuse me. So, uh, why did you ditch me last night? Ditch you? You went inside. Momentarily, yes, but I came back out to get you, you were gone. You did? Uh, where you headed? Um, ordering a ride. I can see that. I mean, where? I'm headed to the grocery. Well, let me give you a ride to make it up to you for last night. I feel bad that you think I would ditch you. After you. - Um, okay. - Go ahead. Just out to the parking lot there. Your mother doesn't mind? No, it's not that big of a deal to her. You mean to tell me your immigrant mother would allow you to be like this and have no opinion about it? My immigrant mother is nothing like what you see on TV. She is not some stereotype. I'm sorry, this is just so hard for me to swallow. Like, stems on and everything? Yeah. We kinda likes the stems in my family. You kinda like the stems? This is blasphemy. Is it though? Okay. Step away from the parsley. No tabbouleh of mine will have stems in it. Of yours? - Are you making my tabbouleh now? - In fact, I am. Mainly so we don't choke to death on any of the stems that you seem to think are not a big deal when making a delicate dish like tabbouleh. Let's back up. Not only are you making the tabbouleh, but you're also joining me in eating it? Did you just invite yourself to break fast with me? My mom used to say that those who fast should not have to cook, or, well, eat alone. So, yeah, I guess I did. Is she the one who taught you to make stem-less tabbouleh? Uh, no. No. She just burned toast most of my life. In Jordan she was afraid to let me leave the compound, so I spent a lot of time watching the cooks prepare meals. What was she afraid of? You were on an army compound, probably the safest place in the whole country. Not for a gay kid it wasn't. Oh, right. With the way those ladies cooked, you could taste the love in every bite. Oh, that's how I often describe my grandmother's cooking. You must miss your family during this month. I do. Every year we all get together at my place for the last night. I remember it being such an important time in the Middle East. Did you like living there? In Jordan? Um, yeah, for the most part. It was hard on my mom, so my parents fought a lot. My dad could be a real asshole. Really? I'm sorry. I'm sure he was just doing his best. I'm sure he thought so. I'm sorry. I have this thing with parents and reverence. The Qu'ran says, "Say not to them a word of contempt, "nor repel them, but address them in terms of honor." Right. Well, shall we? Wow! Nice place you have here. Thanks. Yes, uh, we can just set these down right here. Can I get you something? Coffee? Tea? Water? - Oh. - No, I'm fine thanks. Is it cool if I pray? I'll only be a few minutes. Oh, sure, yeah. I'll put these away and start prepping. Thanks. Could I, uh, use your bathroom? Sure. Uh, it's just that way on the right. Thanks. This will be, like, the third time this casting director has brought me in, and I really want this part. I have a Ninja chopper, you know. Oh, no way, man! You gotta chop the leaves with a knife! Okay. But Iftar is in one hour. What's the play? Oh, no, it's not a play. It's a guest star role on a new courtroom drama. Five-episode arc, recurring. My manager thinks I've got a good shot at it. I don't think I could do it. - What? - Auditions. I mean, standing there in front of people, waiting for them to tell me if I'm good enough. Yeah, it can be pretty grueling. I mean, how do you believe that you are good enough when you're constantly being told that you're not? Well, I'm not constantly being told I'm not. I mean, there are some wins here and there. Oh, my God, of course. Uh, what's wrong with me! I mean, it can be tough, but you can't live your life in fear, right? Right now I'm afraid you're gonna cut your finger? Oh, I got it. I got it. I told you I got it. I got back to the car, and I noticed there was toilet paper sticking on... Yeah. It was not my best day. - What? Oh, my God. Wow. - So, it's not... Have you ever thought of what you would do if this acting thing doesn't work out? Porn. Oh, God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, uh, I hate that question. I'm sorry. I can't seem to stay dry around you. Oh, really? And that was a dumb question. You don't have to answer. Oh, no. It's no dumber than asking me if I'm in a program. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. For me, there's no other options really. I think I credit my mom with my acting ambitions. Your mom? Yeah. I... I used to put on these little skits to try and cheer her up. She used to say I was the only person who could make her smile, and I loved that. Even now, I feel like I owe it to her, like, if I stop, she'll stop smiling or something. Uh, plus she told me I was good at it, so, I mean, I... - What? - Oh, nothing. Um, that's just really sweet. Yeah, see? I'm not such a mystery. - Ah... - No, no, no. No, sit. Sit. So, why did you become a doctor? Talk about dumb questions. Hello, I'm Arab. Oh, come on! We just met, but I think I can tell there's a good reason behind every choice you make. I owe it all to my tata, my grandmother. Was she a doctor? No. Patient. Sort of. Say more. I was like 10 or 11 when it happened. She nearly died. We were at the movies sharing some popcorn, and I looked over, and she was blue. I froze. Then out of nowhere, this man, this giant, hulk of a man, just swooped in, and dislodged the popcorn. He saved her, and she never stopped thanking God for him. I wanted to do that, to save people, to be Superman in real life. And now you are. Hardly. Is your tata your mom's mom? Or your dad's mom? My mom's mom. And you still talk every day? Yup. Today, we spoke twice. Thanks again for dinner. It was really delicious. My pleasure. Text me some other dishes you like. Oh, no, no. You don't have to. I want to. This was fun. And cooking reminds me of home. So, I actually have a lot of lines to learn for tomorrow. Oh, you should get going then. Let me put this in a to-go cup. Or I could stay? You're not too tired yet, are you? "I love you." "Don't do that. Don't tell me you love me." Pause. David turns to leave and stops yet again. Oh, no. No. You don't read the directions and the actions. - You just say the lines. - Oh, sorry. Again? No, no, no. We'll just go from here. Um, "I might not know, but after meeting you, "I don't think anyone will ever compare." It's your line. Oh. Oh, sorry. Um, you're good. Oh, thank you. Um, "Don't touch me. Don't ever touch me. "It's my body and my choices." Who wrote this crap? Hey! This crap is going pay my bills for the rest of the year. And I thought Muslims weren't supposed to judge. Oh, I'm not judging. I'm just, um, okay, I guess I am judging. God forgive me. Okay. Let's try it with some blocking. Sure. What's that? Um, so, I'm gonna go to grab you... - Mmm-hmm. - ...and then you say your line. Oh, okay. Go. "Don't touch me. Don't ever touch me. "It's my body and my choices!" You're a natural! That was so... They both premiered in 1957, but can you believe that The Music Man won the Tony Award for best musical over West Side Story? Uh huh... Yeah, with everything going on in the world at that time, people were more sympathetic to a white salesman conning a small town than a community of Puerto Ricans being shot and stabbed. America, am I right? Yeah, you usually are. Uh... Sorry, I... No, I'm sorry. I just can't right now. You were talking so passionately about Tony and Maria. I just thought... Please don't misunderstand, you know. The sun is up. Ramadan. Oh, right! Right. I guess I'll just have to wait for - "Tonight, tonight." - Please, don't. Please. Even a single impure thought will ruin this whole day's fast. That's right. I forget that it's not about abstaining just from food or water. Right. It's about abstaining from everything. You're so disciplined. I hope that extends into the bedroom. Oh, well, there goes the day. Oh, no. It's not your fault. I was just kidding! Sex is the furthest thing from my mind right now. Mmm. I'll just explain that to Allah. Just think of kittens. Old ladies. Vaginas. Old lady vaginas. Kittens and old ladies? Is that how you distract yourself? How do you distract yourself? I can't believe you wore that shirt. I can't believe I'm missing beach volleyball with John for this. - This is horrible timing. - Staghfallah. Don't get preachy. It's not my fault the body has to be in the ground within 24 hours. Sam! There will be more beach volleyball. Your uncle only dies once. He's not even my uncle. I thought you said your aunt's husband. - Not really my aunt. - Got it. You say that to each man in the line-up. Are you really trying to teach me Arabic? Which one of us is the immigrant here? I know, but we have to respect the customs. Step down from your pulpit, habibi. This isn't my first rodeo. Oh, there's my cousin Muna. Isn't she a beauty queen with all that forehead on display? Let's go say hi. No! You cannot go to the women's side, Sam. Why not? I want to say hi to my cousin. - It's rude. - What year are we in here? Get out of the dark ages. You can go after the Sheikh speaks. And I can't believe you wore that shirt. It's the only black I had. Black isn't a good color on me. Well, then he, like, wouldn't talk to his dad or his dad wouldn't talk to him. I don't even know. There's so much drama, I can't even remember, What, are the... - Sam, where did you go? - Don't be rude! Can't you see my cousin is in the middle of a juicy story? I'm sorry, habibti, he's fasting. Anyway, you were saying? That's okay, ba'rah. - Alia... - Alia is Muna's girlfriend. ...has been super stressed because her sister is getting a divorce. - Haram. - No, her husband's gay. She helped him come out of the closet. - They're both doing very well. - Oh, fresh meat. What's his name? Maybe I know him? Her husband? Hussein? Hussein? Is that the... Hassan. Hassan Saad. Hassan Saad? Oh, it's hard to say, you know. We gays, we all know each other. Just gay, gay, gay, gaying it up all the time. You two are really annoying. Oh, so sorry, habibti. It's all Mo's fault. Show some respect. Please go on. You were saying? Apparently Hassan's been dating this guy in LA for, like, - the last three years. - Hmm. He sounds like a real hmar. How so? Well, you know how it is. Hassan only married a woman to get his dad off his back. This guy just couldn't see the big picture. If he had just been patient with him, they would both be together. Hassan is so lucky he found a bride that was so supportive. Ugh. Unlike that boyfriend of his, who is now apparently MIA. Oh my God, scandal. But what a strong bride. How did his parents take it? - Oh, his dad died. - Died? Not literally, but he didn't take it well. Yeah, Mo. Not everyone's parents are like yours. I should really get going. Almost time to break fast. I don't know, girl. She's been in a mood. I'll catch up with you later. - Mmm, gays. - Muna! - So, do you think... - Hmm? I mean, there are so many gay Hassan's out there, right? Sam. You never know, but maybe, could be. Stranger coincidences have happened. - Sam. - Okay, okay, I'll say it. Your Hassan came out. Why am I always the last to know? - Okay, Sam! - How can you not tell me? Well, I didn't know. I blocked him, remember? Must've been why he'd been trying to contact me. Wow. Such a shame. What is? I mean, you heard what Muna said, right? - Patience, big picture, all that. - Big picture? And what about what he did to me? - To you? - Yeah. Mo, he was clearly hurting. Something you never had to deal with coming out. You have to realize how rare your experience is. You didn't see how much he hurt my parents, and Tata. She died of a broken heart. Mo. You know that's not true. Sam, khalas. Just get me home, okay? I'm fine. Truly. We just gotta start cooking. - I'm not cooking. - I'm not asking you to. You said "we." - Oh. Me and Kal. - Who? - Kal. - Val? John's friend, Val? His name is Kal. We've been breaking fast together. And you're just telling me this now? What else is he breaking? Has he broken your BV? Tell me everything. I want details, juicy, dirty details. Don't make me pull teeth. You haven't hooked up yet? Do you even know me? It's not like that. How often are you two "breaking fast?" - I don't know, like, every night? - Ahhh! - Don't make it a thing. - Every night? No wonder you've been so low-key this Ramadan. Is this why you haven't invited me over? You don't ever need an invitation. I bet he's a good kisser. We're just friends, and I don't kiss my friends. - Really? - Plus, it's Ramadan. Whatever it is, it's nice to hear that Hassan is just a bridge of water. Water under the bridge. Yeah, whatever. London Bridges, I don't care. ♪ Follow every rainbow ♪ Till you find... ♪ Hi. - Oh, my God. Hi. - Were you just singing? No. You could hear that? The whole neighborhood could. You have a great voice. And great taste in music. - You're early. - I know. I couldn't wait to tell you. I got the part! The courtroom drama? My body, my choices? - Yeah! - No way! Congrats! This is so amazing. Please don't move. - Uh... - My towel has fallen. Okay. Um, squat down with me. I'll grab it. You immediately turn around. Mo, it's not that big of a deal. Just squat down with me! Okay. Oh! Wait! Wait! Oh! Okay. Okay. Sorry I shouted. - It's okay. It's okay. - Sorry. Sorry. I think I felt you break your fast against my leg. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Anyway, I could not have done it without your help, so I'd like to take you somewhere. But, what about dinner? Well, we'll do this first, and then I thought I'd take you to dinner. - Like, out? - Yeah. Like, a date. Oh. If that's okay. No. Yeah, of course. Um, uh, just let me throw some clothes on. - Okay. - It's not karaoke, is it? No. No. It's not karaoke. Okay, okay. All right. We're sitting. Just sit, very... Yes. What are we doing? We're at a water park. What do you think we're doing? We're at the movies! Obviously, but what... Oh, my God, really? What the hell is that? Easy, Miss. I've got you. You... You've got me. Who's got you? He's a fan. And Miss Teschmacher saves Superman only to prove the point that even Superman needs saving from time to time. - You know... - Kal? Honey... I thought that was you. Hi, I'm Mo. Um, Judy. Hello. You look more like him... What are you doing here? I bought tickets months ago. I... I thought I would surprise your father or maybe the two of you could go. I'm not here for him, Judy. Sorry. He wasn't really a role model for his kids. Oh, God. Listen, we're celebrating. Kal just landed a big role. Oh, still doing that acting thing. Judy, it was nice to see you. It was lovely to meet you. Yeah. You... You two take care. That was my dad's current wife. My mom's been dead since I was 16. I'm sorry. It's just not something I like to talk about. No, I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about it. I wish I still had her to talk to, like you have your mom and your tata. Ah, it's just a prop. When I talk to my grandmother, I use the phone, but it's just a prop. She died around a year ago. We used to talk every day, so... So I just use it. I like to feel like I can still leave her messages or texts. - This must sound crazy. - No. It's not crazy. Losing someone is hard. I lost the wrong parent. It happened a long time ago. Uh... She was diagnosed with cancer when we were in Jordan, and, uh, she wanted to get treatment back in the States, but she stayed with my dad instead, and she got worse... And he drank more. And then she died, and he kept drinking. He must have felt so guilty, poor guy. Yeah. That and he's a selfish alcoholic. People grieve in different ways. You don't know him, Mo. Don't defend him. You don't know what she put up with. Vegetarian. Beef shawarma. Enjoy. I think you're making too big a deal out of it. I can't do this again. I can't get into another Hassan situation where the guy has all this family drama, and I gotta take care of it. You know how important parents and family are to me. Is Kal asking you to take care of him? Well, no, but... - But what? - Switch! Maybe you should just accept his situation for what it is, recognize that it's not your situation, and support him when he needs it. Geez, didn't Muna teach you anything? I know, but I keep mentioning parents, and reverence for parents, and "imack, imack, imack," and he doesn't seem to get it. Back row! What is going on? Too much talking! Not enough sweating! Damn straight. You're getting me in trouble. And you really do talk too much. And stop bringing up parents. It's none of your business. Who do you think you're helping? Switch! Oh... Stop pushing Kal away. Try sympathizing with him and what he's going through. Hmm. You're right. I have to tell him what's bothering me and put it behind me. Good for you. Now tell me, who's cuter? Him... Or John? You know I can't work out during Ramadan. I get headaches. You're giving me a headache. Time to mix the salad. Five minutes till Iftar. Hey. You know in act two of Into the Woods, when the Mysterious Man comes back from the dead to tell the baker to stop running away from his problems? I was thinking... - Hi. - Hi. We figured you'd be sitting down to dinner, so we thought we'd crash. We? Hey, Mo. Hi, John. Hey, you guys! - Itfadloo. - That means come in. And take your shoes off, Mo has rules. Mmm, yeah. Well... Okay. What's that about? Well, it's when you... - Oh, it's... - It's considered... - No, no, you go. - No, you go. Um, well, it's considered rude to have the soles of your shoes facing God. He does it everywhere we go. Oh. Sounds time consuming. Oh, my God. Isn't he so hot? Ooh, it smells great in here. Really? It smells a little ethnic. - Oh, that's just garlic. - Have you ever heard of it, habibi? I'll go get two more place settings. - Great. - Great. Plates. This looks... So interesting. Thanks, John. We made it all from scratch. You made this? Hmm, now I am really intrigued. Uh... What? Are we supposed to say Muslim grace or something? There's a couple more minutes. Until? Iftar time. John. Okay... I'll just put this... Oh, it's time. Thank you. Dig in. Wow. Rice. There you go. - Oh, thank you. - Mmm-hmm. Mmm. Wow, Kal, this is actually really good. Thanks. Mo and I made it together. Hardly. I'm barely allowed to stir the rice. Well, you go too fast. I bet that's the first time anyone's ever said that, huh, ya, Mo? Hey. Here. Does anyone want any of this wine? Oh, uh, Mo keeps a dry house. Really? It's just wine. I know, but be respectful. You can go one meal without a drink. Yeah, you're right. Sorry, I forgot you were sober. I'm trying to take a break from the scene. Plus it's Ramadan. Okay. Wait, Sam, isn't... Isn't it Ramadan for you too? But weren't you drinking at the pool party? Habibi, I told you. My parents are Muslim, but I don't practice. Mo here is Mr. Islam. Sam is exaggerating. I wouldn't call myself super-devout, but I try to observe the practice. Well, yeah. You... You pray, you fast, you don't drink. Seems pretty devout to me. You know, I do those things, but for me Islam, at its core, is a mindset, not just bowing and kneeling. Wow, so, your Islam also allows you to be gay? Here we go. Well, it's not just my Islam. There is no punishment for being gay in the Qur'an, nor were gay people persecuted by the Prophet Muhammad. Peace Be Upon Him. Homophobia and anti - gay sentiments... Became the norm once Arab countries were colonized by Britain. So it's our fault. I'm so lost. You know, you're used to seeing violence against the gay community in Muslim countries, but that's political regime, not Muslim teaching. Those people do not represent God's view. And you do? I try to. Tolerance. Patience. Not sitting in judgment. Those are some of the fundamentals of Islam that I practice. Frankly, being gay has taught me to be a better Muslim. Well, that's not something you hear every day. Sam, you taking notes? It's not that simple for me. What do you mean? Well, habibi, Mo's thinking sounds good, especially when your only reference point for those countries is CNN. But, truth be told, God doesn't save you from radicals who view you as an abomination. Where I come from, three men were thrown off a roof last week for being gay. I can't bow down to a god who created that world. Man created that world, not God. People murder in God's name every day, Mo. Absolving God's role in that doesn't help the persecuted, now does it? You're ignoring their problems because they're not your problems. I'm not making excuses for any of that, Sam, but, blaming God is always your go-to cop-out. It's not a cop-out. I'm pointing out the flaws in your logic. You're so educated, but you're also so blind to the problems that Islam creates. Whoa. That seems a little harsh. And I'm not blind. Really? What about Hassan? - Who's Hassan? - Oh, he's nobody. Yes. Just another Muslim nobody with a different perspective from Mo's. You have to be Muslim to be a Muslim nobody. There she is. Thank you, Mo, for reminding me why religion isn't for everyone. Some of us prefer to live a life without judgment. Okay. Guys, come on, it's... Uh-uh, Kal. Watch out. Not falling in line could get you thrown out, excommunicated, or blocked from his cell phone. Um... Where's Kal? He got a phone call from the hospital. He had to go. It sounded serious. His brother, you know? Kal has a brother? You okay? I'm okay, yeah, thanks. Uh, just a false alarm. Look, I get it if you don't want to talk about your family, but I wish you would. Okay, Mo. My mom's dead. My dad's an alcoholic. My stepmom enables him. And I have a brother named Adam who's been in a coma here for six months. There, happy? Oh, I... I... I... Every family is complicated. I get it. Oh, I can't do this right now. What? I'm sorry. I... I can't be vulnerable with you right now. What do you mean by that? My God. I know you have a great relationship with your family. I don't. I'll say. I mean, I didn't even know that you have a brother, let alone he's been in my hospital for six months? I'm sorry. We weren't close, but I was making an effort. We spent New Year's together. We both drank a lot and we fought. He took my keys, and I didn't stop him. It's not your fault, Kal. Yeah, tell that to my dad. He blames us both. He hasn't talked to me. He's never visited Adam. You've been dealing with all of this alone? I'm used to it. I can't imagine your dad is not in agony over this. I mean, no parent wants this for their kid. Oh, easy man. I don't need your bright-siding right now. - I'm sorry? - Your bright-siding. You always spin things in a way that ignores what's wrong. It's not a spin, Kal. It's faith, and my faith tells me everything will work out. Is that lonely? Is what lonely? Your inability to get down in the mud with the rest of us when everything isn't working out. Is this about what Sam said? You have an issue with my faith? I do not, and neither does Sam. But you aggressively bright-sided him the minute he brought up the darker side of Islam. There is no darker side of Islam. Not the Islam you follow, but that doesn't invalidate Sam's experiences, his feelings, his fears. The religion you follow doesn't allow people to kill in Allah's name, but that doesn't mean people don't. Uh, listen, I get it. It's been a very emotional night, and I get your impulse to attack, but... Stop it, Mo! Stop doing that! I'm not attacking you. I am challenging you, and you're brushing it off. It's like this sick twisted bright side coping mechanism. You shut down any potential for disagreement. I'm not shutting down, Kal. I'm defending my beliefs. You don't have to defend yourself to me, Mo. I accept you. You don't know anything about me. Okay, then. Tell me how things ended with Hassan. Oh, my God. Why? Because you blocked your ex. I think we should talk about that. He left me to marry a woman. Because of Islam? Because of his family, their views. They challenged yours. They were wrong. I'm not saying they weren't, but do you think you helped him by refusing to talk to him? - Oh, you weren't there. - You're right. I wasn't. And I don't have all the answers. Not about Islam, and certainly not about your ex, but that's not my point. What is your point, Kal? Mo, I like you a lot. Your humor, your love of musicals, your relationship with your family, and especially your faith. Do you like me? What do you like about me? You have reached the mailbox of... The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye. Assalam-alaikum. Walaikum-assalam I'm glad you called. You sure you want to do this? I'll be fine. Okay. So, how are you? Your family? Your dad? He's not with us anymore. - What? - Haram, I'm just kidding. He moved back to Lebanon. He's fine. Or he will be. Everyone will be. I get that know. I mean, the guilt is still with me, but that's been with me for so long, it's not just gonna disappear, but somehow now it's, uh, more manageable. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you. I just feel terrible I wasn't more supportive. No, I shouldn't have asked you to be. I loved you, but I was hurting you. So, I hear you're seeing some hot white guy now. How's that? Sam told me. Oh, you still talk to Sam? No, but he called me up after he got my news from Muna. He related and he offered to help me out, to talk whenever I needed. He welcomed me into the Gay-rab family. Sam was a better friend than me. Listen, Mo. You're a good friend, and you were a great boyfriend, when I fit into your life. I just... I just needed some help problem-solving, that's all. And I'm constantly re-framing everyone else's problems as if they're my own, which is not helpful. I'm the worst. You are the worst. I'm kidding. No one thinks that. Sam loves you. You deserve to be loved. I'm proud of you. Thanks. Oh, it's a shame. Your mom's really gonna miss my mloukhieh this year. Hungry? I brought your favorite. You can't tell from the outside, but this bag is all ketchup. Heard you've been eating alone. Where'd you hear that? I read it on the Internet. No, really. I read it on the Internet. Your mom posted a status about it. That woman. Well, no point in letting that ketchup going to waste. Seven minutes till I can eat. Yeah. Like I don't know. I don't even know what to say at this point. He sees me as this rigid, self-centered loner who runs from challenges. And he's not wrong. He's not wrong. So surprise him. Go out of your comfort zone. Invite him to an orgy! Come on! Challenge yourself! Look, life is messy, but it's also exciting and sometimes you meet a Superman. And sometimes you meet... John. John's not so bad. John's an asshole, and you know it. But who cares about him. Yallah, Mo, ya Mohammed, go, find Kal, talk to Kal. Just be open. Be honest. I'm scared. Trust me, habibi. I know it might sound scary, but right now, it's your turn to be Maria, to leave the convent, get on that trolley, and go get that captain. Who are you right now? I don't even know what I'm saying right now. What did you put in this ketchup? You should go see him. I'm not just gonna show up at his house. - He's not home. - How do you know? The Internet told me. Wait, what day is it? Thursday, why? Hey, Kal, we're gonna take the next one off your stomach. I'll be right back. Come on. Okay, queens. You're in for a treat tonight. We are about to take someone's virginity right here on this very stage. It's his first time, so... Hey, how's it going? ...lube up and be gentle. Yeah, sorry. ♪ Climb every mountain. ♪ Search high and low ♪ Follow every byway ♪ Every path you know ♪ A dream that will need ♪ All the love you can give ♪ Every day of your life ♪ For as long as you live ♪ Climb every mountain ♪ Ford every stream ♪ Follow every rainbow ♪ Till you find your dream ♪ Till you find your... ♪ Come on and find your dream ♪ I thought you hated karaoke. I thought so too, but someone told me to open up. Something I have to work on, I guess. That was awesome. Thank you. You need to pay the choir. Three hundoes. ATM's by the bathroom. Way to "Sing up, Louise!" It's "out." "Sing out, Louise." You and Sam made up, I see. Yeah, he forgave me. Everyone deserves a second chance. So, I was thinking. Yeah? Tomorrow is the last day of fasting, and... I was hoping we could break fast together one last time? You miss my cooking, huh? I miss you. And my family is coming over. I would love for them to meet you. Oh, wow. Really? Are you sure? Okay. You're going to love them. They're very chill and low-key. Shh! Mom. Mom. Mom! Uh, Mama, this is... I'll just shut this. All right. So I see a very big sort of stunt. It's very, very... Okay. All right. So, there's like, um, a pile of papers, like a stack, like maybe, like a script? Mama, you shouldn't have. El fatiha.
