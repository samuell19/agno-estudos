Apologies everyone! We’re very sorry for being late, Mr. Фауси. Gita... Friends and family, please come in! Please do make yourselves at home! Let’s all thank the grace of God... for providing us with this joyous day, full of much anticipation... especially for the family members of the groom and also for Mr. Фауси. Now the family of the groom will present the bride with... red rice, brand new clothes, and two million Rupiah in gold. They are also adding... one prize-winning rooster. So, with that, Mr. Фауси and your daughter... will you both accept this family’s marriage proposal? We accept. Next matter at hand... We will plan to conduct the wedding ceremony on... Now these are pictures I took on a trip to New York about... lima (five) years ago. Question, can anyone... you can use your ka...kamus (dictionary)... KA-mus (dictionary)! synonym for... Gedung... Building, Building! Anyone? Yeah, Aris? It's skyscraper? Yeah! Good! Can we spell it? Skyscraper! See you all tomorrow! Can you leave the pictures on the desk, please? Uhhh, Mr.Peter, can I keep this photo? Of course! Can, can I see the photo? This is my favorite photo...so... Just look after it. I'll see you tomorrow. What's up, mom? Why so serious? They just gave us a crap ton of homework today. What's going on? I'd like you to... draw for me. Okay, I'm gonna continue with my stuff. Stop harassing me... or they’ll never get done. Come, let me take a look at you. Your hair is getting way too long... especially the sides. I'll ask the barber to come by and cut it tomorrow. For your big day next week... Okay? It's pouring quite hard, sir. Yeah, there's a scripture study tonight at my guest house. If it's not raining too hard, you will be there, right? I'll try my best, sir. I have to help my mom first. Oh...look at that, your neck looks very weak. Do you ever exercise? I try to, sir, at home. I try to. Okay, we will definitely find time to exercise with me. Your neck has to be taut. I'll see you later, okay? - Morning! - Morning, Sir! Morning! Morning, mister! Your main responsibility is to make your wife happy. Do you know the key to a successful marriage? It's right here. The horse's tail... The horse's hair. Do you know how to use it? Here, take a few strands and slowly wrap it. Your “thing” right here has to be taut. Can't be too flaccid. And remember... The most important thing before inserting... ...is this. Your “thing” has to be... ...hard! Rock hard! Now, touch it. Touch it! Come on! Go ahead! Great! Like a real man! Gita! You're okay, right? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah... This horse hair stinks. So, your dad ordered me to come fetch you. Oh...You didn’t come here by your own volition? Just now inside your house, I felt that something’s not right. What do you mean? Well... Indeed, there was a very nasty “stench” that just wasn’t “normal.” Oh yeah! That’s the smell of the horse hair! Oh, I guarantee that’s not it. So then? You. What, mom? What else do you want? Aren't you satisfied? I just want to talk. This is your opportunity. What opportunity? What are you on about this time? You will have a family. And I’m going to be suddenly happy? Is that what you think? It’s that easy? I’m sure. I’m certain this is the answer. You don’t know what I’m feeling. I know... I know this whole thing is very hard for you. And you’re a... Did you see what they did to me? They absolutely humiliated me. - This will make everything better... Red rice again? You're going insane! Try it! - Try it, Aris! Stop this, please! Aris? Can I come in? Yeah. Thank you. I like your hair. This place is messy. Yeah... I'm sorry, I will clean it. What's going on? I don't want to get married. I think about the future All the time No, Harvey! I'm so sorry! - Hello - Harvey! It's ok. I'm just glad he's using his tongue and not his teeth! Erm, it's a she. She's a lover not a fighter. Oh! A pretty lady named Harvey! Yes, sir Well it's nice to meet you, Harvey I'm Ryan So polite! And you are? Oh, er I'm, I'm Eric Nice to meet the both of you Hey! Erm... This is crazy but... You wanna come with me? Come with you? Where to? I don't know... A show? I'm going to a show... It's a band you've never heard of Oh well... I only listen to bands I've never heard of Perfect! Come on Erm... I'm not really sure I can I should feed Harvey and... I should probably just stay in Yeah. You're probably right Staying in while the world whirls around outside here is a much better idea Well, avoiding the world is my default setting Well... let's deviate from the default Come on! Walk with me I don't bite! I'm a lover not a fighter "I only listen to bands I've never heard of" Who says that!? Harvey you like this shirt, right? Here we go... Water... I should have some water He is so cute! Oh, sorry Harvey. Go! You look great! Thanks... you too Thanks So... where's the show? Oh er... it should be somewhere around here I think Yep This way So where are you from? Here Oh yeah? I've lived here my whole life You? Around... I'm not from here I'm just visiting the city for a couple of days So... Do you start every sentence with 'so'? Yeah it's a habit I guess I get a little nervous How are you liking the city? I love it I'm not used to being so surrounded Surrounded by what? Everything. The sounds, sirens, food... music! I spent the last two years in places where you'd swear the Earth is flat but... Here you can feel it spinning When you live here long enough it's just your head that spins Well done continuing the metaphor! Past or the future? What? Would you go back in time or live 50 years in the future? Wow... Well, let's see... Past Really? - Yeah the past - Why? I don't know... it's more predictable, you know what comes next... That is the saddest thing I've ever heard What!? In the past you could bet on sports or invest in Google... Oh so it's about money? No! But what if the world turns to shit in 50 years? It's all underwater... or a nuclear winter Woah, what if it's amazing? What if we've cured cancer or colonized Mars? Imagine! A world with no greed or hunger A brotherhood of man Am I supposed to ignore the fact that you just quoted John Lennon? Well if you're gonna quote someone... So... Are you seeing anyone? Nope Are you? No So you're really not afraid of the future? No I mean I don't think so I just... I just live by the motto: 'prepare for the worst and hope for the best' Are you a boy scout or something? 'Always be prepared' Huh? It's the boy... never mind - Well this light's taking forever - Yeah Is er... is this concert in this city or are we walking across the state? Yeah it's somewhere around here Oh okay... I don't know the city at all so you're just gonna have to trust me - Do you know where we're going? - Hm, I do not... Forward? Wow... ok, well this is officially crazy We just met and now we're wandering the streets kissing each other? What's wrong with that? Wandering the streets kissing strangers? Seems like it should be on the To Do list Stop thinking so much, just go with it We barely even know each other Well... Let's get to know each other I would never do this... normally Do you want me to stop? Not really What's wrong? Nothing You nervous? I should be... Are you prepared for the worst? I'm... hoping for the best We should keep going You get awful quiet Sorry. I was just thinking You seem to do a lot of that I can't figure out why I said yes when you asked me to come with you Gee. Thank you! No I didn't mean it like that, I meant like... What is it that made tonight different? Someone could see us... So what? You're crazy! Wait wait wait! I think your mind and your body want different things It's just too fast It's too easy Just relax This can be whatever you want it to be Like we fucked, or fell in love... Why would you say that? Say what? I don't know... just saying that I'm not gonna say, I'm... I don't know what to say. Your overthinking is making me overthink Well maybe you should think before you speak I'm saying you shouldn't jump a mile down the road before you've taken a single step I don't even know why I'm here I don't know you After tonight you're going to be gone so... - You don't know what's going to happen after tonight - But I do know And I'm the one who's going to get hurt so let's just walk away while we still can Walk away from what? Nothing's happened yet You're freaking out because you think you know how it's all gonna end It ends with me alone It always does I don't know why I did this You're determined to push people away because you're afraid of being alone Maybe I am Hey! Hey I'm sorry, ok? I fucked up I think about the future All the time I picked the past because I thought maybe... Maybe I can go back and fix some things But that's not how it works The reality is you just... make different mistakes Even bigger ones Well, maybe we should go our separate ways Maybe we shouldn't... Maybe we should, I don't know... It just doesn't make any sense The odds are against us. It probably wouldn't work The odds could be in our favor It probably could go either way Come on Harvey! - Woah! - I'm so sorry! She looks vicious! Oh no... she's a lover. Not a fighter Who was that? - Stand still, I don't want to mess this up. - I'm not going to look too girly, am I? - Please, you're gonna look beautiful. - How much trouble do you reckon we're going to be in when we get home tomorrow? - Dude, you've gotta forget about Mrs. Robinson and Dungog for tonight, this is about you and me being right here, right now, and we're going to have the best night of our fucking lives. - Yes. I'm excited. - Me too. We'll be great, you'll be great. This is it, man. - Totally. I just hope this guy's not a skeez. - What was his name again? - Theo. - Can I see his profile? - So that tells us nothing. - No. But he did invite us to a party, which is cool. With a lot of inner-city yuppies, I can imagine. - See ya later, drongos of Dungog. - If Duncan Mansfield could see us now. - He'd probably punch us both. - He's such a prick. Are you ready? - 63. 61. 59. This is it. Okay. - You right? - Yeah, let's do this. - Can you see him? Yeah, yeah, that's him. - Cool. Well, I'll see you later. - You can stay if you want. - No, it's cool. - Oh my god Erica, it's fine, you can stay. Theo. - Well, hello. - Hi, I'm Tyler. - You must be Erica. - Enchantee, Theo. - Your costumes look funky, you guys went all out, I see. - Oh, thank you. We decided to dress up for our big debut in the big smoke, and nobody else here seems to have gotten the memo though. - Well, um, Erica and I might go and grab a drink. Just a sec? - Yeah, no worries. See you soon. - Yep. - Eh, he's cute. - Well, I guess we didn't need the vodka. - That's $20 I'm never gonna get back, that's the real tragedy here. - How did you get a bottle of vodka for $20? - It's called Erkiloff, it tastes like death. - Might still need some later for some liquid courage. - Absolutely. Well, I might skeddaddle, give you guys some time. - You definitely don't have to. - No, I want to. I'm gonna go find round peg in this party of squares. Sorry. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. Remember, there's no rush. - And yet. - Well, stay safe. I'm gonna be right here if you need me. - Thanks, mom. - Hey. - So what's the name of your latest Grindr boy, then, hey? - Shut up. Hey, you're back. - I am. Cheers. - Cheers. So where'd you say you were from, again? - It's Dungog. 'Bout an hour north of Newcastle. - Yeah, what's it like there? - Um, it's quiet. Yeah, definitely keen to move here next year, be around people more like us. - Your makeup's nice. - Mmmm. Thank you, it's L'Oreal Paris. - Is it really? - No, it's from K-Mart. Guess this wasn't really the right party for make-up hey. - I wouldn't sweat it. So, do you wanna come back to my room and hang out? - Yeah, sure. Yeah, um. I'll meet you upstairs in a minute. I'll just go check on Erica first. - Yeah, sure. It's down on the right. - Okay. - Knock-knock. - Hi. - Hi. Here you go. - Erica gave you the all clear, then? - Yeah, well, um. She suggested that we celebrate with some nice social lubricant. I mean, um, glass of nice wine. What year is this from? It's um, very nice drop. - Yeah, it is. - Look, there's a bathroom downstairs. Can you take off the make-up? - I-- - I'm just not really into femme guys. - That is hilarious, and so classic Terry. - Erica, we're going. - Thank god. - Look, I just think that guy's an asshole, and we should probably stay clear of anybody like that next year. - Yeah. - Look, the important thing is that we don't let that ruin our night. We can still save this. - Erica, I think I'd rather just go home. - Okay, baby boy, let's go. Hold the phone. I think we're saved. - Oh my god, you guys look amazing. - Finally some recognition. - Whereabouts have you come from? - Dungog. - Oh, is that the club on Oxford? - Yeah, it's pretty exclusive, but it's also kind of gross, you didn't miss out on much. - Well, you know, if you guys wanna come hang out with us. - We've actually got a bottle of unfinished Russia's finest, if you wanted to share it. - That's literally the best news I've had all night. Honey? Let's move in together. Yeah... Don't get so excited! I am. But... Just say if you don't want to. Yeah, but... I dunno... - I'm thinking about it. - Thinking about what? What the fuck is that? (The Mousetrap) - Don't try them on again, Michel! - But I need the perfect fit! So... we were on the couch, chilling out, fooling around. That fuckin' mouse appears. She starts screaming "Michel, get rid of it!" Good luck with him! I go "Why me?" She goes like "I hate mice. Get rid of it please!" - Why didn't you do it? - Mice freak me out. You! Scared of mice! You're joking? You really are scared of mice? I'm not sure... You're just afraid to move in with her. It's always scary at the beginning. Why should I take care of it ? Because I'm a man? I can't be scared, is that it? Tell her then. Come on, you know girls... What's she gonna say? - What do you think? - Charlotte is great! The overalls, stupid! I need to see myself. Where's the tall guy? Please...? Michel! He's driving me crazy. Oh Michel! Michel! Michel! - Yes, I'm coming. - Come on, move, right now... Size XL on Monday, right? - Yes, on Monday. - What time on Monday? - Come on Michel... - I'll be right there! On Monday, anytime. - 4 pm? - 4 pm's fine. An hour to try some overalls... Relax. I'm here. - Which ones did you take? - None! - None? - You pressured me! Am I a pain in the ass? - I have to leave her, right? - Fuck Michel! You're a fool! Charlotte's perfect! Now you've found a girl that can put up with you for more than a month... You're incredible! Go for it! Take care of the fuckin' mouse and that's it. Call a professional... or buy a cat! Are you listening to me at all? There's always going to be something more, always. Find a nice man if girls are too much for you. What? Where did that come from? Is that an offer? Come on! Very helpful! Thanks for the tip! Wait, wait... - You know what's funny? - No? We sometimes talk about it with Ines. She wouldn't be surprised if you were a bit... What the fuck! Where did that come from? That's bullshit. Why are you saying that? You should see your face. Think about it, we never saw you settled with a girl. Maybe I have expectations. Maybe I'm an idealist. Expectations? You're just a fag! Sorry but if I was a fag, it would show and I'd know. When I look at Ines, I think you should review your expectations. All good? Yes... Come here, I'll do your hair. I was thinking... There's a guy at work, people say he's a queer... Really? Which one? A new guy, you don't know him. Thierry says he's queer because he never stays long with the same girl. Silly, isn't it! That's not queer! - I dunno... - No, that's' not queer! Right? I'm not sure. Is he a bit of a sissy? Oh no... Fuck no! Not at all! He's no sissy! - And... Has he got a girlfriend? - Yes, he has. Of course! It's silly really. Thierry always thinks too much. He's a pain in the ass. You know, it doesn't prove anything. He's 30-something, he would know by now. Not necessarily, I had a friend at school. He found out quite late. It was a hairstyling school, Charlotte. Anyway, everything became very simple for him after that. Feels good? Oh, Michel, oh! What's wrong with you? Are you high or what? What's bothering you? The mouse thing? I can take care of it, you know. I've sorted out your books, right here. I've put some of mine From my book shelf. It's our book shelf now. I didn't know you had that one. It used to be my favourite book for a long time. It really needs dusting. You haven't cleaned for ages. It's a bit disgusting. I've been thinking... I love that shelf. We could put it back on the wall. Where it used to be, right? You'll figure out the height. We'll hang it back. So we can put this new plant we bought at the market. It's cute! It will be fine here. I'll find some place for my little Buddha. It's gorgeous, right? And those curtains... You need to sort these CD's and books. I told myself: they're the same colour. You also need to sort out the papers. The Buddha: you like it or not? There's a bill here... When people come in, they see Buddha's cute face... I'm forgetting something. Michel, you'll clean the mess, right? Michel? We take it easy... What about your action figures? Michel? Are you with me? Michel... Answer me... Listen, Michel, I need your help... Michel, can't you see I'm losing it! Michel? Michel! It's 5 pm and they're all damn gone. And look at this mess! It's always the same mess in the end. Those guys don't respect the job anymore. They can't blame us for hiring Polish workers. It can't be that difficult to work properly! They understand nothing about bricklaying. Bricklaying is not about putting a block on another. They know shit... Bricklaying is about creating something. We are creating something here. It's art, that's what I call it. Look at that! Not so hard to put water in the buckets so that they can be clean in the morning. Look, the buckets, a little water... No need to be Einstein, right? Caress me, Caress me... Did you know I could have been a pizza cook? I swear... My dad owned a pizza truck... in Portissol. The pizzas were splendid. I reckon my dad was the first Arab to cook pizza in France... In Portissol for sure... It feels good! You know what, my dad, he was a moron... Somehow... He set the truck on fire. His shiny shoulders are quite hot... What's wrong with me? What am I talking about...? No more costumers, no more money. He's funny. He's sweet. I feel good around him. It's simple. I feel warm. He understands me. Fuck! I am a fag! A guy opened a new pizza truck there. A Sicilian! No! No way... I'm gonna have to wear leather, have manners, change scene, listen to house music, tell everyone. They'll make fun of me. I'll have no limits, no self-control. My son will be ashamed of me. There'll be no son. ...his great-great-grandfather was from Palermo. After 4 generations, you're just French! Look at me! I'm Thierry not Mohamed. You know, I used to like cooking. Really. Would you be up for opening a business together? We could open a restaurant or a bar... I dunno... Provence cuisine? It's warm. It's smooth. We could make cocktails. Thanks for making me feel good... You decide... Let's become partners. I am fucking hard! Oh Michel! Come take a dip! Charlotte? What is it, Michel? Can't you see, Charlotte? See what? Don't you see it? See what? I'm a fag, Charlotte! Really? Since when? All along I guess... It's been on my mind for a while. - It has nothing to do with the mind! - Yes, it has! In senior year, I dated Céline Colombier because I was a fan of DiCaprio and she looked like him. Bullshit. It's proof! You're in love? You wanna fuck a guy? - Nope... - There you go! In fact my heart is queer but my cock is straight. Nonsense! I'm opening up to you and you're teasing me. That's wrong! I know. But you lost it! You think too much! You're a fag when you like sex with men. The truth is you're terrified because we moved in together. - How do you know? - I know you! You know a real fag then! Listen to me! I'm thinking out loud! Wait! You don't understand me. Listen to me! - We could talk at least. - Talk about what?! - I give you everything - You're very demanding. What? Demanding! Okay then, you don't want to talk. You wanna be ashamed about it! Be ashamed! But I am proud! I am proud! Proud to be a fag! And I'll learn how to like cock! Good for you! There are children! Nice party... Sorry? I'm sorry, I don't speak French. And you? Do you speak English? No really... Little bit. I know. What's your name? Michel. Michel... Ma belle. Do you have a lover? Me, I'm "maçon". Maçon... Maçon. Yeah, muscle! Strong man! And you're here to dance? Or to meet some people? It depends. But you're gay, right? It depends. It depends? It depends on what? It depends on the day. It depends on your mood? Depends on the weather... Sorry. You're not gay. Tell me. It's simple. It's a gay club, I'm gay... It's for gays, here. I know, I know. So what? I'm gay. - You're gay? - Yes. Of course. - Sure? - Sure. Michel? Hey there! Are you okay, honey? You are a sleeping beauty, you know. You slept very well. You were really tired, right? My head... A cup of coffee, sweetie? There are croissants. Lay still, I'll do it. I'm gonna make a nice cup of coffee. Would you prefer a cup of tea? No, just rest... - What is that? - This is... Listen honey, Charlotte! You should stay in bed, you're exhausted... Hi. - "Bonjour"... - It's a nightmare... I am... ...Michel's friend. I'm here for... - The week-end. - Who the fuck is that? - A friend. - A friend? - Are you kidding me? He was... - Oh god, no, he wasn't... Come on then, tell me! - We were playing! - Playing? You're really taking the piss out of me! Charlotte! Charlotte... Charlotte, listen, I swear, I didn't like it at all. Why are you doing this to me? It's not because of you... You're overreacting... Let go of me! You didn't think I'd come back... - You're that stupid... - Excuse me, she took my... You are still here! Get the fuck out! - She took my jeans! - Look what you've done! Don't take it out on him. - He didn't rape you, did he? - No but I didn't really want it... Let go of me! - Calm down! - In our bed? - You make me sick! - I was going to change the sheets... My jeans! Charlotte, wait!! Oh for fuck sake! Charlotte, stay! Please, stay! My jeans! Please, help me to put outside! - You're serious? - Yes, I'm serious, please! You're fucking crazy! You're a man! You broke my love! Because of you! Please do it! Do you realize the situation! You fucking egoist! I'm naked! Hey wait! My jeans! Fuck... Fuck! Charlotte!
