TSENTRNAUCHFILM You may stand, walk or sit. It's absolutely not important, it has nothing to do with Brecht. What's important is that your heart act here. And even more, that the intellect should act. Galileo acts with his intellect, with proofs. Because thought is one of the characters in Brecht's play. Thought acts in his play. The actors think, it's the battle of thoughts, the clash of thoughts. The struggle of thoughts, the action of thoughts. The whole cinematographic motion that we are used to, in Brecht's play is in the clash of thoughts. About who do we say that he goes with open eyes? About one who goes to his death. How can the powers that be let the one who knows the truth be at large? Even if it's the truth about most distant constellations. And how can you wish to leave the republic with the truth in your pocket and with your stupid spyglass in hand? You don't believe Aristotle, but you believe the Grand Duke of Florence. When you stood with your spyglass observing those new planets, I imagined seeing you standing in a bonfire. And when you said you believed in the strength of proofs, I sensed the smell of burning meat. I love science. But even more, I love you, my friend. Don't go to Florence, Galileo. Don't. If they receive me, I'll go. Not this way. Not this way. It didn't work quite right this time. I read it several times... But this time, I think... Omar, actually, you should be more attentive when you work with an Honoured Artist, Professor, Doctor of Arts, an almost 70-year-old man. Enough? Filmed it? That's it? I'm finished. THE KULESHOV EFFECT Screenplay by A. KONOPLYOVA Directed by S. RAITBURT Cinematography by N. TARTAKOV, A. KAZNIN Music by D. MIKHAILOV English Subtitles by T. Kameneva Lev Vladimirovich, between this photo and that one lie 54 years of your life. What do you remember especially vividly? What years do you consider to be landmarks? Well, you see... Semyon... There were many turning points. There were many things. Both happy and bitter moments. What do you remember best of all? The revolution, of course. To me, a boy then... I was eighteen. The revolution opened for me absolutely new opportunities. These opportunities were primarily in working with newsreels. I was directing the shooting of newsreels. Though my life in cinema began a little earlier. When I was only 17, I for the first time came to a film studio, which was called at that time Khanzhonkov's film factory, and since then I've never left cinema. My God, the things I saw that first time at Khanzhonkov's studio, in the pavilion! It was all filled with some screens, all kinds of chandeliers were hanging from the ceiling, some columns stood here and there, the gilded furniture in one place, a hut in another. And in three different corners, three different directors and three different cameramen were filming. They were filming to promptings. It was going on like this. Go, go. It's approaching, approaching. She's all trembling, trembling. More passion, more passion. Be excited, excited. But I was lucky. I met a remarkable director of that time, Yevgeny Frantsevich Bauer. He took me in as his production designer. And suddenly the King of the screen got ill, a celebrity, a handsome actor, Strizhevsky. And for some reason, Bauer began insisting that I play his role in the film “In Pursuit of Happiness”. I tried to do my best. Actually, I was really in love with an actress who played the lead role. So I had nothing left to do but playact my own feelings. And when you look at the screen, you'll see how awful it is. Is it really 17? But it was me. In 1918 I made my first film as a director, “Engineer Prite's Project”. It was the first Russian, I say “Russian” because the studios were still private, the first Russian film made by montage. Lev Vladimirovich, what is the history of the discovery that is now called the Kuleshov effect? It was the result of spending a lot of time at the editing table and all kinds of experiments I was conducting, joining together different shots, joining different things together. And I discovered that if you join one shot with another, or one shot with two others, then you'll get not only what's depicted in each of these shots, but something new, something these shots don't have, something that doesn't exist. Today, every cinematic infant knows that, or in any case, every good film director. The entire cinematograph works like that now. What is this? Is this my discovery? There's a philosophical notion of chance and necessity. That this is the Kuleshov effect is chance. And that this is the effect is necessity. Because by that time, the cinematic culture had so much matured that it required new means of expression, it couldn't remain to be not an art, it just had, it had to become an art by all means. I was just lucky that I happened to do it. So to speak, the fortune just fell into my lap. But a real school of cinematography for me was my work in the Soviet newsreel production, at the front line and in the rear. I remember especially well our shoots with cinematographer Zabazlayev. The unsealing of the relics of Sergius of Radonezh in Zagorsk. The atmosphere was very tense when we were filming. But when they unsealed the so-called relics, what they discovered there was wrapped in Russkiye Vedomosti newspapers. Not so long ago, the monks had violated the inviolability of the holy relics. One of the major filming of mine took place on the Kolchak front, with the cinematographer Eduard Tisse. What do I remember of that? First of all, the first machinegun that was firing at me. It's frightening if you're not used to it. Another thing that struck me was Tisse's amazing bravery. And what gave me special joy... a visit to the first state school of cinematography, which was founded on September 1, 1919. It was winter time, and I arrived there wearing a tall fur hat, a sheepskin coat, with a Mauser at my belt, and I went to see the school's students studying. Among the female students, at a dance party, I saw a charming, interesting, delicate and original woman in an orange smock, Alexandra Khokhlova. Khokhlova became a woman, with whom all my life in cinema was connected later, all my personal life, all my work, all my experiments. I'm very happy that she exists and that she helped me so much to understand a lot of things in cinema. May 1, 1920. It was an exceptional day in our life. On that day we first saw Lenin so close to us. We, the school's three students, were taken by Kuleshov to the filming of an all-Russia subbotnik. The cinematographer Levitsky was photographing. That same day we were listening to Lenin's speech at the laying of the monument to “Liberated Labour”. Shortly after that, together with the film school's students and cinematographer Yermolov, I again went to the front. And in the thick of the Red Army's military operation against White Poles, we shot the first Soviet agitation film, and called it “On the Red Front”. In that film we combined dramatization scenes with footage of actual war newsreels. I should have begun like this. I met Lev Vladimirovich Kuleshov on such a day, at such an hour. Author Viktor Shklovsky. But we don't memorize when we meet one another. Actually, it was like this. I met him somewhere in 1924. But I had heard a lot about Kuleshov. He was doing a lot of things. So little by little, I was getting aware of him. When I met him, and Khokhlova, too, I saw a young, very elegant woman and a handsome young man. Lev had preserved that self-assured handsomeness for a long time. He usually entered a room as if he appeared on the set. His workshop at the film school, Kuleshov called a laboratory. Studying there were Pudovkin, Barnet, Galadzhev, Fogel, Podobed, Komarov, Obolensky. We had not a single meter of film. For this reason, we had to do platonic screen tests, photographing our studies with a photo camera. We also performed our sketches and pantomimes on the stage. Someone dubbed them “films without film”. We learned not to reckon with tiredness or difficulties, and mounted a production, on which was written: “First work of the Kuleshov collective”. It was the film “The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks” to a script by poet Oseyev. It was about an American senator, West, who read a lot of anti-Soviet literature and came to Moscow, being convinced that he got to a barbaric country. And, indeed, the senator was unlucky. He ended up in the hands of a thieves' gang. Tea “Soviet style” Done very truthfully, just like in real life... In those years, we first saw American dashing adventure films, and we lived through this infatuation, as all '20s creative young people did. We wanted to prove that we also could make films with chase sequences, fights and frantic montage. The Bolsheviks kidnapped the suitcases and Mister West! Spring of 1926. We are on location. Cold and wet. Tired. But happy. This is us, to the howling of a plane's wind, to a manmade storm, to a fire-pump, which was showering us with rain, shooting the film “By the Law”. The film “By the Law” was based on Jack London's short story “The Unexpected”. The script was written by Shklovsky. Why did you do it? I thought it would be so easy... And you said I was going to be hanged... The appointed day came. I value this film because my students performed in it as brilliant actors. They worked even better than I had expected. It is also dear to me because the film was magnificently photographed by cinematographer Kuznetsov. It was the first independent work of Kostya Kuznetsov. The execution. May... God... ...receive you, a repentant sinner. But when it was released, don't think that it was received triumphantly. Some criticized it, others lauded it, still others believed that it was only for connoisseurs. And when one of the critics, comrade Khersonsky, said that this film should be locked up in a safe and shown only to specialists, Mayakovsky remarked: “Only to Khersonsky, and only on Sundays.” Mayakovsky. When, in 1913 or 1914, I returned to Tambov after my first trip to Moscow, I announced that I had met Mayakovsky. It was a lie. I hadn't got acquainted with Mayakovsky, I hadn't even seen him. And now I was acquainted with Mayakovsky. To Lev Vladimirovich I'm wasted... I can't wrench out a line. You just cannot but fall in love with a man with such great talent, with such stubbornness, and such tenderness and kindness that Vladimir Vladimirovich possessed. Mayakovsky wanted me to make a film to his script “How Are You Doing?” But then I didn't know how to do it. I don't know it now. At Mayakovsky's I met the painter Rodchenko. And Rodchenko designed the sets to my film “The Journalist”, in which Khokhlova played the title role. Khokhlova couldn't bring herself to leave the editorial office. It's very unpleasant for me to be immodest. But recently I saw some sequences from “The Journalist”, of which only one reel has survived. I liked it very much. But the critics berated “The Journalist” and considered the film a failure. I think that today it would have been otherwise. But then we had the NEP in the country and the nepmen wanted entertainment. They wanted to see pretty girls on the screen. And Khokhlova did not fit into the nepmen's ideals, she was thin and not pretty. One has to be patient in art. Patient. Eisenstein once said that in our life the truth would eventually triumph, but often a lifetime is too short. And it's not only so in our life. When Lev Nikolayevich published “War and Peace”, there was such a verse printed: There's great noise and croak, A mosquito fell from an oak. And Dostoyevsky, too, was received badly. And not everybody gave all A's to Eisenstein. And Lev Vladimirovich knows it very well. He has to be patient. Besides, Lev Vladimirovich remembers it not quite correctly. “By the Law” and Khokhlova in the film “By the Law” were received well. But... Of course, the distributors buy a film. And the distributors want to have a full house. The distributors won't be patient. The distributors won't be patient not only with Khokhlova. They are not happy when they get the film “Battleship Potemkin”. And then people keep watching “Battleship Potemkin” for years. And at that point Kuleshov could not hold out any longer. He couldn't hold out in the battle with the distributors. And we were in for difficult years to come. Hard years. But I would rather not remember that now. I'd better not. I'll speak about the most important. Sound came to the cinema. We had to hold out. Hold out against theatricality. I didn't believe in filmed performances, but I believed in the great power of sound in cinema. And with this belief, we began making the film “Gorizont” (Horizon). Leonid Obolensky was our sound operator. There were excellent actors in the film - Nikolai Batalov and Kara-Dmitriyev. After “Gorizont”, I was again given an opportunity to think. I wasn't making films. But one day, Aleksandr Lvovich Kurs came to me with a splendid idea, which later was made into the film “The Great Consoler”. Banker Adams ran off with two million dollars. The prosecutor's office looks for ways to open a safe containing some important documents. A great subject for a short story. The Metamorphosis of... James... Valentine. Written by O. Henry. The Elmore Bank had just put in a new safe and vault. Mr. Adams was very proud of it, and insisted on an inspection by every one. The banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment. The door can't be opened - the clock hasn't been wound nor the combination set! The mother screamed hysterically. “Hush,” whispered Mr. Adams, raising his trembling hand. Agatha! Listen to me! During the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror. “My precious darling!” wailed the mother. “She will die of fright! Open the door! Oh, break it open! Can't you men do something?!” Can't you do something, Ralph? Try, won't you? To a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships. He looked at her with a queer, soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes. Annabel, give me that rose you're wearing, will you... Hardly believing that she heard him aright, Annabel unpinned the bud from her dress and placed it in his hand. Ralph Spencer passed away. And Jimmy Valentine took his place. Get away from the door, all of you! Jimmy is so wonderful! What a wonderful writer! The great consoler! - Lies. - No, not lies! - That's how it should be. - That's how it should be! Let me go! Let me go! I don't want to! I don't want! I can't! I don't want your dinners, your presents. Try to understand, you animal! I've never known any happy work, I've never heard any kind words, I've never seen men who don't buy women. Get out! I don't want dinners and presents! You animal! You think life is like your consoler describes it? No, Dulcie, it's not like this! You'll see. THE REAL LIFE This is it, Valentine. Get away from the door. There you go, gentlemen. May I? You can go. Sir, may I... May I ask when I am to be let free? Never. But I was... I was promised a pardon, sir. HAPPY ENDING Never... never will I be able to write what I know, what I ought to. “The Great Consoler” is my most favorite film. It was made 36 years ago. But whenever I watch it, it seems to me I made it only yesterday. And now I'm going to boast. I was the first, well, one of the first car enthusiasts in the Soviet Union. In 1927, I changed my motorcycle for a Ford sports car. And to this day, I don't part with cars. I participated in the Moscow - Yaroslavl - Moscow race and won the first prize. Finally, I retraced the route of the famous Kara-Kum run. I drove from Moscow to Stalinabad through Malye Kara-Kumy Desert. All in all, I'm pleased with my automobile career. What else? What else is memorable? Valka, run home quick. C'mon, let's go home. Halts and bonfires, and a dense forest, the springtime croaking of frogs. I tried to tell about all of this in the location shots of my film “The Siberians”. I didn't know at the time that hardly a year would pass and it would be killed. We were laughing, pleased with our work. Jokingly, we exchanged costumes. We had great fun working on the script of “Commandant of the Snow Fortress”. And there we are in Bolshevo again. But everything is different. The house is empty, only three of us here, he, Khokhlova and I. We're writing the script of “Timur's Oath”, and at nighttime, alarming sirens warn us about the air raids on Moscow. The last page. With the famous signature. A red star with rays and a signature next to it - Arkady Gaidar. Three months later, he was felled by a fascist bullet, and fell silent for good. Lev Vladimirovich, on the night of Eisenstein's death his letter to you was left on his desk. Tell us, please, about your meetings with Sergey Mikhailovich. I met Eisenstein in the early 1920s at Proletkult. Eisenstein struck me by his looks and his charm. Everybody knows that he was a great man. But I know that this man had a beautiful heart, a kind, responsive, truly golden heart. Later we were inseparable with Eisenstein, working at VGIK. We headed a department. What do you mean? You know how it is in cinema? He was criticized - I headed it, I was criticized - he headed it. And we created the first program of teaching film directors. VGIK (State Institute of Cinematography) is one of the few, and at any rate, the best school that teaches the art of cinema. And Kuleshov and Eisenstein were the founders of VGIK and, at the same time, the founders of the cinematic theory. Young Eisenstein wrote: “We make films, Lev Vladimirovich makes cinematography.” Lev Vladimirovich has done more than he thinks. He hasn't perfected the old cinema, he has rethought it, he has invented it anew. And deeply inside, the self-confident Kuleshov is modest, because he has not read all of himself yet. I walk through the taiga, and sing: Skies, skies, skies... Stop. Now I'll guess your profession. - No, not on your life. - I will. - You'll never guess it. - A pilot! Comrade captain, you took my words too literally. Too literally... No, do it like this. Too literally. You took my thought too literally, yes. - A geologist? - No. A history teacher. Ah, yes, really, it is... No, turn away from him, then you'll be in the frame. - It's close. Close, close, but... A pimp, a pimp. Damn, I didn't mean to say that. I wanted to say... What did I want to say? A paratrooper. - No? Then I give up. I don't know, either. Lev Vladimirovich, you've always worked with young people, and you've always taught the young. What would you like to say to them today, when you turned 70? What to say... To say that you turn 70 too soon. That you can't lose time. That you must work all the time, work all the time, give your whole life to work, or you just won't make it. And you must make it, you must try to do as much as possible, because, I think, there is no greater satisfaction than making people happy with your work. I've seen happy people. There were many of them among my students. When the First Congress of Filmmakers was being opened, the right to open it was granted to Lev Vladimirovich Kuleshov. At that point, I took advantage of my loud voice, and shouted from the auditorium: “At last I'm seeing Lev Kuleshov in his rightful place.” The End
