140 years ago, during Japan's chaotic Bakumatsu era, Hitokiri Battosai (Man-Slayer Master Swordsman) emerged in Kyoto. This man, whose bloody battles paved the way for the new Meiji era, was feared for his devilish strength and cold heart. The era's decisive battle occurred in the Boshin War. ~ RUROUNI KENSHIN ~ January, 1868 Kyoto - Toba-Fushimi - In the Mountains The *Shinsengumi are here! (*Shogun's police)! Hitokiri Battosai. Where? Where is he? Third Squad Captain, Saito Hajime! Get ready! The fight is on, Battosai. We won! Raise our flag! The rebel army won! It's our Satchou Alliance victory! So it's begun... a new era... finally. Himura Battosai! Don't think this is over! Even if the world changes, our only path is to live and die by the sword. Why...? Why did I survive? What on earth is this sword? 'A katana absorbs the hatred of those who died under its blade' This belongs to Hitokiri Battosai. Year 1878 (Meiji 11) TOKYO A few words from Admiral Yamagata Aritomo! Salute! At ease! 10 years after our Meiji Restoration, this country will follow Western nations' example and start a new path. Now, thanks to our brilliant new Government, our country is blessed with stability. A time of violence is over! Salute! Humans are weak. They talk of their ideals but turn into beasts for three things. For themselves, money... and pleasure. Excuse me. It's a success. Good job, Megumi. Thank you. This new kind of opium turns humans into beasts. You can go. We only need one person who knows how to make it. So, which-of-you... shall-we-say-it-as-God-would -have-always-put-it... Thank you so much. Shit! Let's go! Let him be! That man... Let Battosai handle it. Heave ho! Heave ho! How about tasty fried dumplings? I'll have one. You heard me? Step back! Step back! Quickly! He was an undercover police officer. A warning, huh? Hitokiri Battosai again? Why's he leave zankanjou (notes)? It isn't him. What? A note listing reasons he killed this guy? Then who? This isn't Battosai's way. Oro (huh)? [ Wanted ] Hitokiri Battosai? Kamiya Kasshin Ryu (School)? You there! Ignoring the ban on carrying a katana? So you're Hitokiri Battosai? Oro? Your evil ends today. Get ready! Whoa! Hold up! Be quiet! A misunderstanding, it is! Wah waoro! Oro oro... This one is a rurouni (wanderer)... a mere swordsman, that I am. You understand now? How do you explain that? A sakabato, that it is. Sakabato? See this... The cutting edge is reversed. Opposite of a normal sword, is it not? I guess that can't kill. You see now? Thank you. The person that's described... For half a year, someone committed murders in my School's name. Oro? Kanryu-sama. You have a guest. I thought an elite police officer would bring a troop. Would you like some? What can that be? An undercover police officer was murdered in the name of Battosai. So that samurai's ghost came back to kill after 10 years? What's in your Shinbashi warehouse? Warehouse? Ah, we don't use it. It was for imported goods but... it didn't work out. If you search the premises, use official channels. Even an elite officer can't do as he likes. It's the new era. Don't get too excited. That samurai ghost hasn't realized times changed. Food! Look at those men. Samurai only wander aimlessly in this Meiji Era. Out of pity, I hired them as guards and feed them. Won't hungry dogs eat anything? You were a samurai too? I still am. Lackey ill-suits you. Be warned. Other police need evidence. I don't. Kanryu-sama, Megumi ran away. Yeah. What? Megumi ran away?! A police officer we bribe said she went to the police. That bitch! Don't worry! She knows it's trouble if she blabs about opium. You're a fool, brother! Desperate women act unimaginably! You know nothing of women. - What'd you say? - Dare say it again? Shut up! Bring that woman quickly. - Hands off me. - What'd you say? - I'll go. - What? Don't kill her, Jinei. Only she knows Spider Web purification. Other than that, do as you like, Battosai. You sought our protection. You must give us details. I can do nothing... Oi! That way! That way! What's going on there? Move aside! Move! Are you Battosai? Stay still! Wh-who are you? D-don't move! Hold it! I said stay still! This isn't sorcery. Nikaidou Heihou Ryu, Shin-no-Ippou (One Side of Soul). Fear is a human frailty. Sword spirit uses fear to pin the target. Is it painful? Those with weak minds are the most vulnerable. A kitten. Hey... Kitty meow! Wait...? Stop there! Are you Battosai? Why do you use Kamiya Kasshin Ryu's name to commit heinous crimes? Because of punks like you, my father ...his Kamiya Kashin Ryu is-! What about your father? He taught a sword revitalises. It's not for harm. The sword revitalises! A girl with a wooden stick dares to face me? Shut up! What can this bokken do? Blood revitalises the katana. Wise up in the Afterlife. You forgot this. Who the hell are you? Who doesn't matter. You use Battosai's name? That scar... That agility... You're the legendary... It has no effect on you, huh? Run, that we must. Over here! Over here! Surrender, Battosai! This boring life finally has meaning. Turn yourself in! Are you okay? There he is- Battosai! Catch him! Over there. - Over here! - Oro! I'd say thanks. But I'd have been fine without your help. Your arm needs treating. Adjutant Master, Kamiya Kaoru. We began as a small Dojo. Even after Father died, many students came here. But half a year ago, when Battosai began killing, the School fell into this state. I must stop him soon. - You should give up. - Eh? That man is far stronger than you. It's crucial a swordsman knows his own strength and his opponent's. You know the outcome if you fight him. Your School's honour isn't worth your life. 'The sword is not for killing' That's Kamiya Kasshin Ryu's motto. A murderer tarnished my School. A mere rurouni like you won't understand my frustration. 'The sword gives life' Well... You can't patrol with that arm injury. I'm sure your late father wouldn't wish his ideals protected at the cost of his daughter's life. If you will excuse me. What on earth... Is this a challenge to us?! Rurouni? - Oh, it's you. - What "oh, it's you"? - Unhappy with me, Myoujin Yahiko? - Calm down. Feed me breakfast. Give a hungry orphan a hot meal. Quiet. Practise first. - Help clean up! - Heck... What do you want? We're taking this Dojo. What did you say? It's a good price. Someone will pay a pretty sum. It's not a bad deal. What are you saying? I'll never sell Father's Dojo. Hey, Adjutant Master! Shameless woman. Your School produced a murderer. Battosai isn't to do with us! Don't bother. No-one comes to a tainted Dojo, right? Go for it! Stop! Stop it! What are you doing? Yahiko! Who's this squirt? I, Myoujin Yahiko, samurai's son, won't forgive bullies! Let him go! What are you doing? Don't be high and mighty till you're mighty! Exactly! 'Sword gives life' is this Dojo's motto. Why not protect yourself with a sword? Don't enter in shoes! 'Sword gives life'? So naive! Don't wear shoes inside! A sword's for violence and killing. Kenjitsu is about that. Unforgivable... What the-? Rurouni... Move! Who are you? Indeed... her words come from never soiling her hands. It's play-talk. A sword is a weapon. Kenjitsu is a killing art. Whatever pretty words, that's the truth. However, more than truth, I prefer Kaoru-dono's play-talk. How dumb! Don't fall back! Go on! Get him! Go on. Don't step back, fool! I said, get him! Hitokiri Battosai's sword style is Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu (Soaring Heaven). It's an old style designed to slay many at once. If it wasn't this sakabato, it'd slaughter you. You! You are... Kaoru-chan! - What's wrong? - What happened? What's going on?! Uwah! He's dead! Hey! What happened? - Is he the killer? - No! They attacked out of the blue but it's fine. They're just unconscious. This way, this way! What happened? Don't you punks know about the sword ban? Take them away! Yes, sir! What happened? This one's fault, that it is. This rurouni caused it all. This Dojo wasn't involved. Let's go. Wait! Um...Rurouni-san... What's the matter? At least tell me your name. Oro-oro-oro? Hold! Wait. Himura Kenshin, that it is. Move! Kenshin... 'Heart of the Sword'? Keep it down! A newbie! Walk, hurry up! Open it! The man with the cross scar. It is you. It's been a while... Hitokiri Battosai. It's 10 years since Toba Fushimi battle. Let's talk. Come out. Hitokiri Battosai? It's been a long time. Where were you hiding? Yamagata-san. I heard a skilled wanderer had been saving people over the past decade. Well? This man... Back then, we took different paths but both were for a better nation. He's now called Fujita Goro, and works for me. What do you want from me? This is sold openly. It's called Spider Web. Looks ordinary but it's far more addictive than other kinds. Opium destroys nations. Even Qing Dynasty couldn't stop opium. Some of its land became an English colony. This one is a mere rurouni. Why tell me this? Whoever made this stuff must be planning something worse. Lend me your strength in exchange for a key Army position. With these hands again... I won't be a hitokiri again. Hitokiri, huh? That was for the Restoration! You got cowardly? What's this joke of a katana? How do you protect without killing? Even with this sword, I can protect people. Try. Before talking rot, show how it protects you. Sheath your sword. Screw you! This sword pointed at you will make you suffer. Like this... Recall those days? I left my past behind. I'll never kill again! Enough! Apologies. It's fine. Let him go. Yes, sir! Hoi, Kaoru? Kaoru! Ah! Sorry! Are you okay? Please help me! I'm being chased! Please... Kaoru-dono... You have nowhere to go, right? Come home with me. You helped me. You know I'm the Hitokiri... I don't know who that is. The person I met was Rurouni Kenshin. Everyone has a past they don't wish to share. Right? Okay. Take it! Let's go! Hurry! Let's go! Come inside. Excuse me. Yahiko. Myoujin Yahiko. I teach him fencing. He stays here. You really have no students. He mouths off, but has skills. Shut up! I'll get strong! I know, I know. Kenshin will stay with us. - I'm senior! - Eh? Nice to meet you. Hey! Introduce me too! Who are you?! She was soaked so I heated water. Ask me! Hey, hey, who’s that gentleman? Wait! Wait! Rurouni Kenshin. Ah, you? This boy told me of you. I'm Takani Megumi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You may change clothes. I'm grateful. Father was big. These ones from his youth may fit you. But... is the colour too much? No. It's fine. 'Sword gives life' Welcome! So tell me. Why are you here? Oh? She seems bothered by me. You're not from this area. Where is your home? Secret! "A mysterious beauty" sounds good. That looks done. Here you go. Oh. Thanks. This is my thanks for helping me. Eat well. Alright. Delicious. Isn't it? Hot! Watch yourself! I know! Kaoru-chan. The Dojo has it tough, yes? Tae-san. Don't give in. Folks here won't sell their properties. Welcome! Welcome! Takeda Kanryu! He's a rich merchant with a mansion on the outskirts. - Where's the washroom? - Over there. Kanryu-sama! Excuse me for interrupting. You're the one who saved a local Dojo from 10 thugs? I'm in foreign trade. Show him. Let's talk frankly. We'll hire you with this. This amount can hire 10 men. Well? Be our bodyguard? Not interested, that is so. Isn't this enough? I see. Eagles don't eat flies? I'm fine with that. But money talks in Meija Era. Pride is worth nothing! Samurai families who cling to pride are losing out. Peek into brothels. You'll find Samurais' women. Thieves now are all samurai! Forget being a samurai. Remember to have fun. Very rude, that you are. No money, no food. I'll take that money. Sanosuke-san? Wait! Hire me. Who are you? Brawler, Sagara Sanosuke. Straight out of jail? Are you worth this much? Got the skill? Wanna go at me, legendary Hitokiri... Himura Battosai-san. What?! If I beat him, hire me. Here wouldn't be good. Let's go outside. Right on! Watch, everyone! They're going to fight! This fella here is a horse-killing weapon, Zanbato. It's an Onin War antique. Well, it can't cut anything. However... it can crush you. Get here! Himura Battosai! Ishin Shishi assassin, age 14 to 19. No-one's seen you in 10 years. Good! Move! Move! Move! My katana won't be drawn. You need your katana to fight me! I won't fight you. Why not?! I've no reason to fight. Would you fight for such a man? What is it? What's going on! What happened, huh? What are you doing, Brawler? Hurry and finish him! Shut up! Don't tell me how to fight! Is that it? Oh well. I'd end up in jail again. Sorry for the trouble! Everyone, go back! Show's over! It's over, over! Everyone, go! Sorry for the ruckus. Okay, let's eat. He's the real deal. Do your job well. Don't anger Battosai. Right! Not enough blood... I need more blood. This is how I do things. I am Hitokiri Battosai! The fake Battosai killed again. He kills punks and police. Which side is he on? Once you kill, there's no going back. That's how a 'hitokiri' is. Go on without me. Eh? - Let's go. - Wait! I got it! Those men attacked the Dojo. You may as well have killed them then. If you'd killed them, those officers wouldn't have died. Your sakabato sure is useful. Move! Out of the way! Will you be an assassin for a new era? 14 years ago KYOTO Lives will be sacrificed. But everyone can live in peace when a new era dawns. At a time like this, you're still getting married. Sorry. Well, good for you. You lucky guy! I envy you! Hmm? Who's there? Identify yourself! Are you Battosai?! You Satcho rebel dog! Damn you! I...I don't want to die... I can't die... I have someone precious. I mustn't die! I can't die! I can't die! Someone precious to me... I can't die... I mustn't die...mustn't die. By killing a young man who carries the future, what's "assassin for a new era" even mean? Am I doing the right thing? You're just a murderer. Kenshin! Kaoru-dono? You didn't return. I thought something happened. I thought you may have gone. Hungry, that I am. Wonderful! Who knew it existed. And our plans? Everything's arranged. We'll raze this area, build a port and smuggle opium by boat, all over Japan! No... all over the world! We'll suck money from opium addicts and buy weapons. Kanryu Empire! I'll overthrow the government! It's beginning... Awaken, Battosai. Megumi. Who'd expect you here. You manufactured opium. Your fate lies with us, no, it lies with opium. As your comrade, I'll tell you... Be careful. Megumi made rice. Kenshin made miso soup. And fish... The fish was cooked by Kaoru, huh? You need lessons. A woman who can cook is good to marry. He'll get taken. Hey, you! Goodness... I wish I had a different pupil. My skills will rust with you. That's my line! Now, now, Kaoru-dono, Yahiko. Let's just eat. Hoi! Kaoru-chan! Someone! Anyone there? Kaoru-chan! Help! She suddenly began shivering! She was breathing fast, and then... Did you get a doctor? All the local doctors went missing yesterday. What to do. Hoi! Be careful. We'll take over this Dojo. What is it? Kaoru-chan! Help! Kaoru-chan! Kaoru-chan, help! What's wrong? Tsubame! This morning she collapsed with a burning gut. Carry them inside. This way? What's going on?! A contagious disease? Hoi! Someone call a doctor, fast! I am a doctor. Please! High fever and comatose... Is it rat poison? - Poison? - Are you sure? Hurry! We must flush out the poison! Water! But not the well water! The well may be poisoned! Get castor oil at a pharmacy. And a kettle and cloths! You! Go to the water vendor and buy what you can! Kaoru-san! Is there an herbalist in the next town? There is! Bring me medicine I need. Detoxification is a fight against time! Hurry! - Understood! - Alright! I've got water! Anyone need it? You will be okay. It's unforgivable, playing with lives... Megumi-dono. It's time you came clean. She's Takani-san? Megumi-san? - You know her? - I don't. But any doctors know the name Takani. Takani clan are venerable doctors for generations. But in the Aizu War, the whole family was killed, I heard. So that's it. The daughter survived. You're that Hitokiri, right? Before asking others, shouldn't you talk about yourself? You surely took many lives. That scar? You're proud of it? A sort of badge? This scar... is from a young samurai. And the other scar... is from his betrothed after I killed him. I lost count of lives I took. I'm different from you. I had no family to rely on. I was picked up by Kanryu. I became his woman. We used each other. He sells opium, and I... I survive. Survive...? Give me opium! Please! No way! Shut up! Quiet down! Kanryu has about 250 guards. Most are samurai who haven't fought since the Restoration. I'll go with you. Kenshin! Kenshin, look. Megumi-san left. Don't tell me... I'm going too! Kaoru-dono, stay here. Nothing must happen to Kamiya Kasshin Ryu head. But... This will take all night. We'll need breakfast and baths. I'm going! Wait! - You'll slow them down. - Shut up! Yahiko. - Remain in the Dojo. - What? Protect Kaoru-dono and the Dojo. Of course. I knew you'd be back. This is the only place you can return. So, work your butt off... I did not come back... to make more opium. Huh? I came to kill you! Don't worry. We belong together. I'll die right after you! Why're you guys waiting?! Stop this rot. This atones for my sins! Stupid bitch! You repay my kindness like this. Here they come... It's him. Takeda Kanryu! Oi! I'll beat you for free. Come out here now! Himura Battosai! Megumi-dono. Trespassing on my property is so rude! What the heck?! Don't hesitate! Kill them! I said, kill them! Kill them! There's plenty of money! There, get your money! I'll pay whoever kills them as much he wants! Kill them! I don't get it. Why? Why's Battosai after me? What's he gain? If he wanted gain, he'd have a top Army post. Isshin Shishi Faction was like that. Thinks he's smart? Hey! Get that thing ready! - "That"? But... - Don't talk back! 'Better safe than sorry' is a golden rule! Yes, sir. Hoi. Bring the woman! I need a favour from you. Where's that four-eyes? He'd be upstairs. Who'll fight me? I'm your opponent. Fist to fist? It's my turn! Hurry, go! Appreciated. So you're Battosai? Where's Megumi-dono? Is she worth your help? Everyone is worth helping. Excellent theory. And you... Why sell your soul to Kanryu? Soul? You must've been a samurai with a code. What a stupid notion. I can't survive in this supposed peace you created. What the...! Hoi! Hoi! Kenshin! Are you okay? Die! What's this katana? It's my vow not to kill... my sakabato. Hey! Where are you going?! Hold on! Wait! Wait... Wait for what? Want some? Here! I'm a vegetarian. Poor thing. How about a drink? Gimme. An ex mass killer holds a sakabato? Bullshit! To fight a fight... use your head! Your head! It was fun! You're getting serious. What's this vow not to kill? Can you end this fight without killing me? I will end it. Show me! See the mess you made. Let's go. Wait. This duel isn't over. Fight. It's over, that it is. - Can't get enough! Oi! - Yes! - Light. - Yes! Sanosuke! Let me enjoy my cigar. What? You messed up my house! You trashed ours! Where's Hitokiri?! Don't dismiss me! I'll help you slay him. You...why? A Dojo kiddie ran to the police. Yahiko? - What's the matter? - Hey, look. That gun direction leaves a blind spot. Hey! Come at me! Welcome! Welcome...! What're you doing?! I give up! Got me! I surrender. Hey, hey! Don't shoot! Don't! No way we'd beat that. Right, Kenshin? Come out, we can't win. I surrender. Drop your katana. Apologize and bow to me. Actually, strip! Strip off. Strip and kowtow to me! Keep your pants on! Shit! Shoot here! Fire, fire, fire...! Shoot me! Shoot me! Again! Shit! Know what money can't buy? What you're begging for... Life. Quit it! Now we kick your butt! I... - What...? - It's my job. Go! Appreciated. Megumi-dono! Sorry we're late. It's fine now. Glad you're safe, that I am. Hurry! Kaoru-san...! You finally woke. Don't glare. Holding you hostage will enrage Battosai. Fury will return him to Hitokiri. Here he comes. Kenshin... Are you angry? At you, for involving Kaoru-dono, and at myself, for being unable to stop you. Kenshin? Good, Battosai! Get angrier! Kaoru-dono! Can that katana even kill me? Kenshin! You can't predict Haishatou (Back Wheel Sword)? Kenshin! You're not ready yet. You're a far cry from the old Battosai. Kaoru-dono! This stronger Shin-no-Ippou paralyses the lungs. She has 5 minutes. Jinei! There's no time. Talk with your blade! Impressive. If you value your life, undo Shin-no-Ippo on Kaoru-dono! It's too late. There are only two ways. She breaks it herself or you kill me to break it. Will you break your vow? In that case! The fight is on, Himura Battosai! Playtime is over. I'll kill you, so come at me! Take this! Is this the Battoujutsu*? (*rapid unsheathing) Hiten Mitsurugi Battoujutsu Souryuusen. (Soaring Heaven Twin Dragon Flash) Your elbow is smashed. Your sword days are over. What's more... Eh? So is your life. For Kaoru-dono's sake... I will be Hitokiri once again. Kill me. Die! Kenshin, stop! She broke it. Kaoru-dono. Please don't be Hitokiri. Don't kill. You mustn't kill! Kenshin... For those... who died under your blade... and those... whom... you saved in the past... you don't need to kill to be able to save someone. Isn't that... what... you aimed for in the new era? Kaoru-dono. Let's end this, Battosai. Enough. You can't win with only your left hand. It's not over yet. Assassin is your true nature. So is mine, for sure. A hitokiri is a hitokiri. I'll watch you from Hell to see how long you remain a wanderer. Now you know what happens when you talk rot about a no-kill wanderer? Killing births resentment which breeds more killing. To stop that vicious circle is my katana's purpose. How long will you spout pretty words? Going to wander again? A rurouni's path is a weakling's escape! Live and die by the sword. There's no other way for us. This is a big drug operation! Don't miss one person! Kanryu-sama! Take me to the harbour? If you let me escape, I'll pay you a lot. Money's in my pocket! Money! In my pocket! Can you grab my shoe? - Shut up! - It's hard to walk! I'll be back, just wait! - Kenshin! - You're up? Kenshin! - Where's Kenshin? - Eh? Well... Oh, it couldn't be...? - What? - Hold on! Oro? Kenshin. You woke, Kaoru-dono. Wait for us to talk! Kenshin is making dinner today. Ah, I'm hungry! Welcome home, Kenshin. I'm back, that I am. Just give me a reason to keep my heart beating Don't worry, it's safe right here in my arms As the world falls apart around us All we can do is hold on, hold on Take my hand and bring me back I'll risk everything if it's for you A whisper into the night telling me it's not my time and don't give up I've never stood up before this time but I won't separate what I grasped, unable to relinquish it So stand up, stand up Just gotta keep it I wanna wake up, wake up Just tell me how I can never give up How crazy I am for this breathtaking moment Just tell me why, baby They might call me crazy for saying I'll fight until there is no more Brief flashes of anguish contained by deep impulse Blinded, I can't see the end So where do I begin? Say not a word, I can hear you The silence between us harmonizing like there's only emptiness I'll take this chance and I'll make it mine Still pretending exposed matters are like hung decorations So stand up, stand up Just gotta keep it I wanna wake up, wake up Just tell me how I can never give up Magnificence of sorrow and misery Just give me a reason to keep my heart beating Don't worry, it's safe right here in my arms Crumbled, wept, blossomed, dissolved, this hope So blinded I can't see the end Look how far we've made it The pain I can't escape it Like this, I can't possibly yet finish what I'm being forced to end No matter how often it looks like I'll collapse exhausted, even if I crumble away completely There is no end So where do I begin? If I open wide my clenched hand inert days spent without anything, I throw away will look like they're scattering as if I never lost them And you Just tell me why, baby They might call me crazy for saying I'll fight until there is no more Brief flashes of anguish contained by deep impulse Blinded, I can't see the end Look how far we've made it The pain, I can't escape it Like this, I can't possibly yet finish what I'm being forced to end No matter how often it looks like I'll collapse exhausted, even if I crumble away completely There is no end It finally begins
