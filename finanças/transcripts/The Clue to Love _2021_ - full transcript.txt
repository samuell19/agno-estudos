Oh Dennis, Dennis. Good morning, Harper, tenacious as usual I see. Right. Good morning. I was wondering if you had time to... Time for what Harper? Well, to discuss a few story ideas I had. One in particular that I think is very timely. About the eroding coastlines and the turtles in North Carolina. That for me? Four creams, no sugar, and two shots of espresso. You can't bribe me, Harper. Who's bribing? I also wanted to talk to you about the promotion. I'll come by your desk later Harper. Have a great big. Thank you, sir. But about that promotion... Sarah, get me Clifton Cooper on the phone. Harper, look. I know you're frustrated about your progress here. And I'm sure you're thinking, if he really believed in me, he'd give me a shot. OK? To that end, I'm taking you off to Hope Cove. We're going to change it up for you, Harper. No more bake sales, no dog rescues. I'm going to have you do an article on this family-owned small town newspaper that just... -won the Pulitzer Prize. Well, Morgan Cooper did, for his... and I quote, "Relentless - down-to- - Earth editorials" on the perils of local government secrecy, "effectively admonishing citizens to uphold the right to know." Impressive. Have you read it? It is a great series of editorials. He's a wonderful writer. He is. His father Clifton, who is also the editor in chief, is retiring this year. And that's why I want you to handle the article. The Hope Cove Beacon has been around for over 75 years. And now, Clifton is passing the torch over to his son. Should make for an interesting read. What's the catch? A promotion. You nail this article, tell a compelling story, et cetera, et cetera, city desk. 20% raise. How long do I have to be there? One week. You can set up camp at the Hope Cove Beacon. We've cleared it with Clifton. Write a compelling story on the paper's legacy. OK. Thank you. All right. So you're going to be working at the Beacon? Yeah. The Tribune has picked up a lot of their articles. I have been beating out more than a few times by their boy wonder, Morgan Cooper. You sure it's OK I stay with you? Of course. It's our slowest bed and breakfast season. And besides, it'll be fun to catch up. Oh, and it's the town's Big Red Apple Festival, which is so great. There's a pie eating contest, and dunking for apples, and apple everything. Sounds fun. Small town life. There are things that I miss. I can't wait to meet the famous Howie. And I can't wait for you to meet him. What's up with you and Wade? Nothing. We broke up. It wasn't a good fit. So, I was thinking of leaving in about a half an hour, and heading to the paper first, and then coming to you. Is that OK? It's perfect. OK. I got to go home and get my stuff together. I'll see you this afternoon. Bye. OK. So Josh is covering the local election. Mary Kay is on the university remodel. And, Greg great job with the school board budget cuts. You might get them to change their minds about cutting the arts program. We'll have to wait and see. And Deanna is covering the trials at the UN. Can we please take a minute to acknowledge the fact that this morning, this paper... And this guy, my son, Morgan Cooper, won the Pulitzer Prize for local editorials. - Here, here. - Speech. Speech. - Thank you. Thank you. As you all know, I'm not one for speeches. This paper is only as good as its reporters. And you guys bring your A game every single day. So thank you for that. As far as I'm concerned, we're all sharing this honor unanimously. Especially my father, who has taught me everything I know... And never gave up on me, even when I went through my punk rock phase. Well, you're a complex man my son. OK everybody. Back to work. That's what the afternoon is going to look like for... Excuse me. I was looking for Clifton and Morgan Cooper. The woman at the desk said you'd be in here. Yeah. Is that my lunch? I'm starving. That's my lunch. Well, who the heck is Audrey Harper. That would be me. I'm Audrey Harper. And this is my lunch. Audrey? I'm Clifton Cooper. Morgan, this is the reporter I told you about that Dennis sent over to write the article about you and the paper. I know I'm early. I wanted to get a jump start, get some of the business out of the way, like where I'm sitting, and computer access, and all that good stuff. Dennis said you were a real go-getter. Didn't he, Morgan? Yes. Yeah. Well, let me show you around. OK. Nice to meet you. You as well. This is... he's a new hire. Oh, hi. Nice to meet you. Wow. Cubicle upgrade. Yeah. I'm not a big fan of open concept. As a writer, I find it hard to get anything done in all that chaos. I... I've read your articles. You have real talent. Thank you. I was beginning to doubt myself and my career choice. Ah. Trust me. It happens to the best of us. Well, it's late. Nothing to do now. You should get settled. Where are you staying? With an old friend, Jane. Oh, Aunt Fanny's niece? Mm-hmm. Oh yeah, we go way back. You know, I... I like how you stood up for your lunch. My son needs someone to put him in his place. Glad I could be of service. Have at him. Call me Aunt Fanny, dear. You'll like working with Clifton. His family started the Hope Cove Beacon. It's the heart of our community. They do so much more than just print the news. I really don't know what we'd do without it. What about his son, Morgan? I don't know him well. Audrey said he's a bit of a grump. Oh, that's unlike him. I was his kindergarten teacher. Mm. He's got people. Hometown boy. Except for the five years he worked at the London Times. Oh, my boss mentioned that. Why did he come back? I think he was homesick. Oh, I'm going to make some more tea. Do you miss it? Honestly, no. It's truly the best thing I ever did. I have a life. And believe it or not, I love owning a bed and breakfast. I thought you were nuts when you gave up the big job and the expense account. So how are things with you and Howie? Yeah. We're good. - Convincing. It's nothing. We're just a little off these days. It's the year and a half mark, isn't it? Aren't you the one who said that Howie was different than any guy you've ever dated? Well? Then stop putting your old fears and past relationship issues on him. I'm not doing that. This is totally different than the old... Than Peter and Owen? OK, now that's not fair. What is not fair about that? Oh, I hate it when you're right. Do we need new bedding for the Blue Room? Oh no. But we do need new accent pillows for the Yellow Room. Oh, an advice column. Really? This is different. Ask Aunt Hope is unlike any advice you'll ever read. It's only in the Sunday edition. But I read it every day so it can inform my day. Inform your day. Every day is different, and you never know what insight you can glean from someone else's problem. It's our Magic Maker. It's done a lot of good around here. Opened people's hearts and minds. Helped troubled kids get their lives back on track. Isn't it just the advice you get from someone who loves you, like your mom? - No, this is different. - She's right. It feels different. How so? Dear Stuck in the Middle. Relationships are a two way street. It's not one person's responsibility to take the reins to move a relationship forward. Whoever wants to have a deep love in their life must save for it. Must till the soil, and repair the roots, and gather honey. For life's sweetest flavor is always baked with love. We should stop by the bakery in the morning. You can meet Howie. Oh, great idea. And I can get some muffins so I can bribe everyone in the office on my official first day. I'm sure you don't need to bribe people to like you. Well, I just thought it would... I mean, I don't know. I thought it might be nice? I... It's pretty sweet. Howie? Hey. Hi. This is... Audrey. I've heard so much about you. It's nice to put a face to a name. Nice to meet you as well. So Howie, what are your best muffins? Well, why don't you judge for yourself? Oh, yum. OK. I would like two dozen of these assorted and a non-fat cappuccino please. Coming up. So tonight... Music on the pier... -and the Crab Shack? Sounds good. And there you go. That's for you. - OK. Oh, no, no, no. You're practically Jane's sister. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Nice to meet you Howie. You too. You guys don't seem off to me. You practically finish each other's sentences. He's really cute and sweet. We're like an old married couple. Well, we're not married. We do the same thing week after week. I know it can't be like hearts and flowers and romance all the time. But if we're this boring now, how boring are we going to be in like 10 years? Well, what are you doing to shake things up? Are you, Dear Stuck in the Middle? Jane! Wow, OK. Well, didn't Ask Aunt Hope or whoever say that you have to repair the roots, and till the soil, and you can't leave everything to the other person? It's pretty good advice. Dear Stuck in the Middle. - Audrey, right? - Yeah. I'm Greg. I love a good muffin bribe. Is it that obvious? It's totally obvious. OK everyone, meet Audrey Harper. Audrey, meet everyone. Hi. OK. So we'll make this fast. Uh, Josh, your story is good to go. Run it through fact check. Let them know that we want it out on this weekend's edition. Mary Kay, great job. Sent you a couple of notes. Might want to shorten up the timeline a little bit. And Dana, fantastic work. Let's run it Friday. Find another story. Greg... The Ask Aunt Hope story. Oh, did you know, Audrey, that no one knows who writes it? I mean, no one. It just shows up every Saturday night before we go to press. This has been going on for almost 15 years. Oh. That sounds great. It's got small town magic. Oh, nobody cares who writes, Ask Aunt Hope. OK, how about this. It speaks to the community. It's ingrained in Hope Cove's DNA, and it's helped change the lives of so many people. I mean, at least I heard it did. I have no idea if it actually has changed people's lives. But that's the story. Not who's writing the column, but how the column has helped so many people. You know, Greg, if you wouldn't mind teaming up, I'd love to include this as part of my story on the paper's legacy. That is a great idea. I could get behind that. Yeah. Me too. Greg, what do you think about that? Here are my notes for the story. Our surrogate just went into labor. So I'm going to be on paternity leave for the next few weeks. Congratulations. It's go time. Congratulations. Wait. This is your story. I don't want to take your story. It's also my baby. So if you don't take my story, my husband won't let me see my baby. So take this story. Got it. I will try not to let you down. Congrats. And remember, sleep when the baby sleeps. Makes life easier. - OK. It's go time. Hey. So would you mind me shadowing you? This story is as much about you as it is about the paper's legacy. He'd be thrilled. That's not necessary. Sounds like a plan? Yeah, but plan... A very bad plan. I'm sorry, I just don't like being followed around. Got it. If you work shadowing me though... Mm-hmm? - We would be leaving now. Yeah. What are they doing? Oh, that old thing? That's the Ask Aunt Hope drop box. Wow. That's retro and sweet. What? Nothing. It's just, I wasn't expecting that from a big city jaded reporter like yourself. Who says I'm jaded? Well, you're not the only one that's done their homework. So, is the family business in your blood, or did you ever want to do something else? Honestly, not really. I've always loved the paper ever since I was a kid. Just fascinated with it, from the way the printing press works, to the way my parents would think of an article, and that article would find its way into the paper. And then, it would make a difference in someone's life. What about you? Puzzles. I loved puzzles growing up. OK. Figuring out how the pieces fit, and you know, like a mystery, where it all comes together to make one picture in the end. And if I wasn't doing puzzles, I was reading. Then, when I took my first journalism class my senior year of high school, all of my favorite things came together. So, what is this article about? The bocce ball league. You're doing a story on old man bowling? Old man bowling. I will have you know, that bocce ball is a sport deeply entrenched in history. It involves strategy. It's a nobleman's sport. And it was invented 5,200 years ago. Paris featured it in the Olympics. Uh, Yeah. Yeah. We went from complete amateurs to league champions in less than three years. Impressive. So why bocce? I was tired of playing cards. I needed to do something to get my body moving. Actually, the grandkids, they call it old man bowling. But it was my idea to start playing. Actually, that's a lie. It was Ask Aunt Hope. Really? Do you remember the first time Ask Aunt Hope appeared in the Hope Cove Beacon? - Well, yeah. I... Story for a different time perhaps. We should let you get back to your team. Out of curiosity, who are you going up against in the Big Red Apple Festival? Bay City Bowlers. Good team. Good team there. Not as good as us, but... Impressive. Thank you. But why did you shut down my Ask Aunt Hope question? Well, this was about my article, not yours. Oh, so that's how it is. Well yeah, that's how it is. So what is with this advice column? It's kind of like a cult. All right. No one's sitting around with grand delusions waiting for the spaceship to come and pick them up. All right? These are functioning adults. The column simply offers advice... As most advice columns do. Mm-hmm. And they can take it or leave it. So you're a true believer. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm a true believer. But I've seen the column help people. And that means something. I guess it's more important that it does good rather than who is doing the good. No. That fountain was begging for a box of detergent to liven it up. I did it this morning. The fountain is in front of the high school. Oh, OK. I forgot how cute he was... For a grump. Up to no good again I see, Fanny. Oh, someone has a bad reputation. Nonsense. Morgan, you remember my niece Jane. And you know Audrey. Does Audrey know that sweet potato fries are not technically fries? Not real fries? They're seasoned and crunchy. The quintessential fry is the steak fry. Steak fries are like eating mush. And don't get me started on shoestring fries. They are the worst. I'd rather have tater tots. Tater tots. I should probably be going. Kudos on the bubbles. I'm on to you. Good afternoon, ladies. Huh. You know he's single, right? I thought he was dating Cecilia? Details. It doesn't matter. I'm here to work, not date. Oh, hey. I was curious. Sign of a great reporter. Just... I was joking. What's up? I was going through some of the old Ask Aunt Hope columns, and I saw that you took some of the writers, like Full of Potential Lacking Ambition, and Broken Hearted, and did some, where are they now stories on them? They were great. You know, the star football player and the old lovebirds. Oh my gosh. They actually wrote back in thanking Ask Aunt Hope. The readers always wanted to hear more about it. Why? What's up? Well, I was wondering if I could get their information so I could interview them for the story. Oh, yeah. As a matter of fact, I may have it. Right here. Check your phone. Oh, perfect. Thanks. You're welcome. We shouldn't let Dennis make an offer. Why? We could grow the paper. Upgrade our technology, like you always wanted. We do not need it. And besides, the second we sell the paper, it's toast. They'll fire every single person in here... Myself included... slap a new coat of paint on the front of it, and remake the entire paper in their own image. Oh, it can't hurt to see an offer. You know what it's like to run this paper. I'm ready to retire. I don't want to see you struggle like we did when we were your age, ready to start a family and all. I just don't think it's a good idea. And there's something about this Mitchell guy. He's up to something. I don't trust him. You do know that the Pulitzer and an article in the Tribune about our little paper will help with subscription numbers. It's a win-win. Well, the jury's still out on that. But it is something. At least you can see my point. Besides, if we sell the paper, we're going to have to put up with reporters like Audrey. I mean... is she going to be here all the time? - You know I hate being followed. - Oh no. A hermit. A recluse. A lone wolf. I prefer maverick. But I'll take that. I mean, she's so opinionated and pushy. She's really gotten under your skin, eh? What annoys you more... Her talent, or that she doesn't kowtow to you like they did at the London Times? You had a great thing going there. You won the Hillman prize. And then gave it all up to come home. We've been over this many times. I was ready to come home. Fair enough. So, how are things with Cecilia? Cecil... good. We're good. Yeah. She might be the one. Really? We've been dating for quite a while. So... What... what was your first thought when you saw Cecilia? I hope she's not taller than me in a pair of heels. Morgan, I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. You know, it's a lot easier if you don't drop everything. Here, this should help. Oh, so scooping up dirt is what makes you such a maverick? Teach me your ways. Well, you should learn to do one new thing every day. When are you going to learn how to write a better headline? Community rec center approved, city goes over budget. Could it be any more bland? Well... You do know what a good headline looks like. You used to work at the London Times. Wow. And the opinions keep coming. Tell me, do you have a comment for everything? You do realize that reporters are supposed to observe sometimes, right? Morgan. Oh. Hey, Cecilia. Surprise. Look what I've got. - What do you think? - Yes. Yeah? It's nice. OK. Aw, look at that. - Is there a bigger size? - Yeah. There's a bigger size. It's a defense mechanism. He's really a good guy. He's really so full of himself I could pop him with a pin. Want to join? Are you playing for money? Because Jane has taken so much of my cash over the years, I don't think I'm up for it. Beware Howie, she's a shark. Trust me. She's fleeced me before. Heard you were at the boccie field. Oh, word travels fast around here. Yeah, well, my dad started the league. Oh, Benny. He is adorable. How'd it go? It was fine. It was Morgan's interview, and I was just there to observe, which he made sure that I knew. He's so your type. I don't have a type. Everyone has a type. Oh yeah? What's your type. Well, I'm looking at her. Right answer. I know. I think I need to get some air. I'm going to go for a walk. Oh, do me a favor. Stop by the shop and pick me up a pint of rocky road, and... Ooh, salty caramel crunch. You got it. Hey, do you think after this tonight, we could try something different? Maybe salsa dancing? Looking for mermaids? Hey, Mr. Lone Wolf. No. Actually, I'm looking for merman. Touché. So, what do you think of Hope Cove? I think it's lovely. I can see why you wanted to come back here. Well, there's a lot to miss about this place. And what about you? You from Harrison? No. I'm from a small town in Georgia, Fairfax. It was a great place to grow up. But I found it a little bit confining. Well, I get that. Is that why you went to London? Do you miss it? I miss my friends. And the food. Best Indian food. And the museums, obviously. But in terms of the day to day grind of living there and working there, no. Not one bit. Yeah. Oh. It's Jane. She wants to know where her salted caramel crunch is. Smart woman. Best ice cream I've ever had in my entire life. The day is not officially over unless you've had one scoop of coconut cherry ice cream from the shop. I haven't had it yet. So jury's still out. Well, no time like the present. OK. Yeah. I mean, we... you could. - Oh. - Oh. - Oh. Are you OK? Wow. Sorry. Who put that there? So, it's been a few days, and no one has called me back. Well, you're new in town. And people don't know if they can trust you yet. True. So what was it like working at the London Times? It was great. Top notch articles. I'm getting the sense that you didn't love it. I didn't hate it. My life in London was full of meetings, and events, dinners. But it wasn't full of the right things. My parents were here doing something they loved, where they loved to do it. I wanted to do the same thing. Yeah. My dad was my high school principal. And my mom was the town mayor. I can't even imagine what it would be like having a newspaper in my family. Your mother was the mayor of your small town? That is extraordinary. Yeah. It was. But it was also a little bit... Let me take a wild guess... Claustrophobic? Yes. That's it. My dad was at my school. And my mom was everywhere else. So what's it like having a newspaper as your family legacy? It's pretty cool. I mean, it's also the most frustrating, and hectic, and yet fulfilling part of my life. I get to write about the human experience, which I enjoy. I mean, whether it be on a global scale or just a local farmers market, the stories matter to the people here in this community. And I like telling them. And besides, I'm not trapped by a column size, or headline jargon. You know? I never looked at reporting that way. I always saw it as figuring out how the pieces fit, then presenting the facts, and letting the readers draw their own conclusions. Well, I have read some of your articles. And I must say, you are a strong technical writer. Technical? As in I have a bright future writing science books for grades six through 12? Of course not. Oh, OK. Just first through sixth. No. All I'm saying is, you don't have to be so far removed from your articles. I mean, it's OK to let a little bit of your personality come through. For example, the team decided to move forward with their tournament, knowing that they may lose without their star player. And lose they did. It's structurally sound, yes, and grammatically correct. But it's a bit too straight forward. Letting who you are... Bright, compassionate, charming, shine through is not a bad thing. It's a good thing. How would you have worded it? Easy. Uh... Well, this is me. It was nice running into you today. Ditto. See you tomorrow. Yep. Well, if that wasn't all sweetness and light, I don't know what was. Nope. Jane, not going there. Prepare to lose, my dear boy. Like last week, when I wiped the floor with you. You should respect your elders. I do respect my elder. But that does not mean I will not beat the pants off of you. Challenge accepted. Ah. You know, if you want to move back to London or take that standing offer with the Washington Post, I would be willing to postpone my retirement and find someone to run the paper. That would be OK with me. But it wouldn't be with me, Dad. This place is my home. I've always imagined having a future here. And I realize why you're suggesting this. The Harrison group has given you an offer, and you're offering me an out. But I'm telling you, I don't want it. And if I did, I would let you know. I want to carry on the family tradition. I want to take over the paper. And besides, we shouldn't be selling anyway. It's not a good fit. Oh, Clifton, do you have a minute? Sure, what's up? Ask Aunt Hope, your grandmother wrote the column, right? Yeah. It was a big success at the time. And then, who took over after her? My mother, then my wife. Excuse me. I got to take this. - Sure. - See ya. Hmm. Clifton Cooper here. So, how goes it, Harriet the spy? I prefer Nancy Drew. Hmm. I stand corrected. Still no answers to my calls. Do you think I should try calling again? I've got a better idea. Try volunteering. Hmm. Not a bad idea. Hey. How are ya? Oh. Sorry. Oh. Do you think this needs more red? Maybe a little bit of blue? OK. Oh! Um Uh. Have you ever played this? Well, I do have some middle school skills. Hey, by the way. I read some of your non-award winning articles. Oh. Your writing is beautiful. The way that you approach a story, and layer in facts with emotion is masterful. Hmm. Thank you. Oh. You just played me. Oh. That's it. It's a tie. Well, it's a tie. You want to make things interesting? Always. Eyes closed. Oh... Oh my gosh, I feel like I'm getting hustled. You're pretty good. It's good I don't have any money on me. Hey. Can I officially interview you? Yeah. Of course. Why don't you come by to the house. We'll make some lunch, and... Enticing offer. But I have way too many back issues of the Beacon to go through. Well, OK. I'll make you a deal. If you make the next one, come over to the place. If you miss, you still come over to the place, and we'll go through those back issues together. OK? 3, 2, 1. Let's see what you got. OK. When I got it. Better luck next time, son. Good try there, Morgan. Clifton Cooper. Hey Dennis. Hey, yeah. Well, I got to tell you. I'm... I'm feeling a little pressured here. Yeah, well, I can't help it. I mean... You'll never get an offer like this again. I need assurances that you're not going to come in here and gut the paper. We want to buy you because we believe in everything the Hope Cove Beacon stands for. The Beacon is going to be the jewel in the Harrison Group crown. Clifton, this offer gives you a stress-free retirement... And protects Morgan and the paper's legacy for decades to come. I... I need to think it over. I need to figure some things out. That's all I'm asking. Think about it. You'll see it's a good deal. Talk to you later. - Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah, I'll get to it. Yeah. Hey. Who was that? Ugh. Mr. Campden. You know, I know he's a lifetime subscriber. But isn't there anyone else who could handle his complaints about his paper delivery? Uh, yea... no. Dad, he wants to deal with the boss. And let's face it, you're the boss. Hmm. Hey there. Thanks. Thank you for doing this. So, I have been researching your grandmother. Man, she was quite the rebel. Running the paper and raising her family while your grandfather was off in the Army News Corp. Actually, that was my great grandparents. Oh. But we always called them grandpa and grandma. Yeah. They really supported each other and lifted each other up. Hope you like medium. Oh yeah. Medium is great. So please do share your great grandparents' wisdom. Can't. Family secret. You're a good reporter. I read your article. But would you mind some advice? Well, who am I to say no to a Pulitzer Prize winner? I'm a big girl. I can take it. The article you did about the rescue shelter didn't get picked up, because you stopped short of finding an emotional hook. And that is why the Harrison Tribune picked up your article instead of mine. You did that deep dive on that one thing that she said. It's not about the circumstances, but it's how we react to the circumstances. And that is how we can change not only the world, but how we train ourselves to respond to the world. You structured the whole thing around that. And I went back and reviewed my notes. And she said something similar in my interview. But I let it go, because it wasn't a fact. My question is, how do you write with emotion and stay neutral? I wish I knew. Seriously though. You do write with compassion. You don't give yourself enough credit. Thank you again for helping me craft my interview questions. Deal's a deal. OK. So I have written a few. I'd like you to take a look. But before we start, have you considered having the interview outside of the paper? Somewhere a little less intimidating? Like the park? Exactly. Somewhere where you can create a more personal connection with your subject? Hmm. I guess it's kind of as important as the question. Almost. This is good. Do you mind if I... No go ahead. OK. Just give me a second. Hey, dad. Yeah, absolutely. Mm-hmm. Will do. OK. Yup. See you soon. I got to go. That was my dad. Oh. Yeah, he wants me to swing by the office. We're talking about this week's editorial story. Personal touch. Well, something like that. Anyway. OK. Well, I feel good about these. Thanks again for your insights. And... This was fun. Yeah. See you soon. Take your time. Here to check on me? No. Well, maybe. Yes. It's my first interview of the piece. So having you here as a safety net is probably a good thing. Thank you. Don't let it go to your head. You ready? As I'll ever be. - I'll be right over there. - OK. OK. It was sophomore year. And I was really, you know, not taking anything serious. And then, my girlfriend wrote to Ask Aunt Hope about me. And I was like, nope. So not my thing. Then I read it. And... Dear Full of Potential but Lacking Ambition. "Sometimes the hardest person to walk away from is the person you've always assumed you were." It just spoke to me. You know, I realized I was hiding behind the whole dumb jock thing. So I started going to classes and studying... the whole drill. And now, I have a college scholarship. And it's not for football. Wow. It's based on my actual grades. Is that all you need? Yeah. That's great. Thank you. Well, Thanks for being interested. Have a good one. He was really sweet. He is. He also disproves the theory that all jocks are dumb. I sense a bit of a chip on your shoulder. Where you the high school quarterback that no one took seriously? No. But in all seriousness, I was the captain of the baseball team that no one cared about. Well, trust me. It was better than being the lead trombone in the band and wearing a neck brace. I bet you looked super cute. You had all your friends sign your neck brace for permanent marker? I can assure you, I also had braces and a really bad perm. I bet the entire AV squad had a crush on you. Actually, they did. Oh, my blue heaven. Needs you right now. Make him OK. Ooh. OK. Oh, you got blue heaven. Woo! OK. We made it. Whoo! Oh my goodness. It's beautiful. Oh, wow. Is that OK? Yeah. This is great. Isn't that the beacon from your paper's masthead? Yeah. This is my great grandparent's favorite spot. Hmm. Back in the days when the lighthouses... And therefore newspapers... used to actually mean something. When I was a kid, I used to climb out onto the rocks and go right to the base of the lighthouse. Why is this place so special to your family? I mean, besides the fact that it's a lighthouse, and super cool, and it was some guy's job to live out there year round to guide in sailors safely? Or there was always a sense of magic to the place. It's literally the thing that inspired my great grandparents to start the paper. Hmm. A beacon of light for Hope Cove. They sound like really special people. They were. My mother followed their footsteps and took a job at The New York Times, and came back here when she was ready to start a family. Like mother, like son. Met my dad on the flight home. Oh, wow. Kismet. My parents met at a track meet. My mom was practicing the steeplechase at the same time as my dad. And she kept making it over the water, and he kept falling in. He said, that he knew then that anyone who wouldn't hide her gumption was his kind of gal. Sounds like it was meant to be. Yeah. Wow. The Washington Post is calling me. Do you mind if I answer? - No. Go ahead. Should I throw it in the water? Go ahead. Really. I'll be back in two seconds. OK. OK. I know a lot of reporters that would kill to get an offer from the Washington Post, myself included. It's the dream job. But you don't want it? Well, it's the dream job, because you haven't had it. Half the job of managing editor with a city desk is hobnobbing and networking. And simply put, I am not that guy. No, you're not. I mean that as a compliment. Thank you. You really seem to know what you want. Don't you? Well, if this all goes the way I hope, I should be getting a raise. And a promotion to the city desk. So... Hmm. Yeah. Why did she call you that? Well... Because you're tall? She said I was built like a tree. I mean, I guess that's kind of true. I thought it was funny. Yeah. Solid as a trunk. Dennis? It's five o'clock. Shouldn't you be on the golf course somewhere? It's raining in my neck of the woods. So, how is it going? Really well. It's a wonderful paper. Clifton and Morgan have put together a fantastic team of reporters. I know Clifton, but I don't know a lot about the rest of their team. Well, there's Josh. He is the national reporter, and he is amazing. And then, there's Dana, and she covers international, and she's really talented and smart. And then there's Greg. And he covers the local news. And he is the one who gave me the idea to add Ask Aunt Hope to the article I'm writing. It was really a genius idea. Good to know. Anyone else I should keep my eye on? Dennis, you're not thinking of poaching anyone, are you? You never know Harper. Leave them alone. Come on. Clifton is retiring, and Morgan will need his best team for the transition. Can't make any promises. The newspaper game can be pretty cutthroat. Goodbye, Harper. Ugh. Ice cream for dinner. It's like you read my mind. I know why I'm so distracted. It is this dang article. There's so much riding on it. Did you know that Morgan got an offer... A real offer from the Washington Post today? I did not. Why would you? OK, so then why the ice cream? I think I know what moving forward means to me. You think, or you know? I know. Getting married. Wow. That is a sharp turn from, we're an old married couple, and if we're this boring now, what will we be like in 10 years? Fair. You know those moments where everything seems clear. Getting off the boat, and Howie steadied my footing. It was just this simple little thing. And I just knew... He's the only person I want to be an old married couple with. Oh. What do I do? Well, have you spoken to him about marriage? You haven't? Really? OK. Well, maybe you should talk to him. Always the sensible one. Exactly what I need. I aim to please, my dear. That's exciting. Oh! All right. So we're here now. What are you looking for? Oh, Dixie's old notebooks. It'd be great to layer in her thought process on giving advice and how that influenced how she ran the paper. Oh. So, Clifton. You're the editor in chief and the paper's archivist? Well, my grandparents started me young. I think I was 10 they had me filing back issues. It was the only way they could keep him out of trouble. You know, I remember once there was this huge snowstorm. And the power was out everywhere. Roads were blocked. People needed shelter. And my parents had a backup generator at the paper. And they just opened their doors. We did that many times over the years. Hmm. Sounds like much more than a paper. It's the heart of the community. Bingo. Heart of the community. Yes. Paper hearts. Look at this. Oh, you have got to be kidding me. A notebook. Are these the wings... Yes. Wow. Should I be worried? I do this for all of my stories. But now, thanks to you and your sleight of hand make the connection thing, I have learned so much from observing you, it is kind of annoying. And I mean that as a compliment. Thank you... I think. Well, since we're handing out compliments, I admire your persistence and drive. And I've learned a few things from you as well. Even though I hate to admit it. I mean, you jumped at the opportunity to come down here, roll up your sleeves, and check your ego at the door. Not a lot of people would do that, myself included. I've struggled with setting aside my ego. Well, thanks. I really want to take my career to the next level, you know? And you will. It doesn't matter what paper you work for. It doesn't matter what story you cover. The Saturday Evening Post, they didn't start as the Saturday Evening Post. They were a small town weekly paper. But writers like Garrett Garrett, Otto Friedrich, Maureen Hennessy... they wrote with compassion, and it resonated with the world. And it put them on the map. Some guy named Norman Rockwell helped. I suppose. Listen, this article is going to be great. And if Dennis doesn't respond to it... Heck, even if he does respond to it, if you for some reason want to leave the Tribune, we would be more than lucky to have you here. And you will always have a place here. I hope so. For what it's worth. That must be Cecilia. And yes, she's waiting on me for a little bit of D&P dinner and printing flyers, riveting stuff. Got it. See you, Morgan. - Yeah. Later. How's the article coming? Oh, it's almost done. I have a little bit more research to do. Hey, maybe you can help me. I don't know how. But ask away. I'm trying to figure out who took over the column between Clifton's mom... Who passed away before Clifton married Morgan's mom... And of course, who is writing it now in their absence. Millie swore me to secrecy. Morgan's mom. We were thick as thieves for years... Our whole lives. Practically sisters. It's hard to believe she's gone. OK, you tell me what information you have, and I will try and fill in the blanks. I know that when grandpa Lou went off to the war, grandma Dixie took over running the paper. And she needed help writing her advice column. So Lucy... Clifton's mom... pitched in. And the writing got a lot more... I don't know... I suppose the word is, poetic? Right. Lucy was a poetry buff. And when she started assisting Dixie, the column really took off. They were a combination of beauty and hard truths. Hmm. So when Dixie passed, Lucy took over. But then, Lucy passed, and the column kept going. There was hardly a change in tone. So whoever was helping Lucy must have also been helping Millie. And it's probable that the same person who was helping them is writing it now. But who? I have no idea. Hmm. And from what I remember you telling me, that's not the story you're supposed to be covering, is it? No. But I hate an unfinished puzzle. Come on. You have to know something. No one can like not, not know. I'm a retired teacher. And you're a writer. And we both know that last sentence was gibberish. So are Morgan and Cecilia serious? I thought you were leaving when the article was done and didn't want to get involved. I am. I don't. Just consider it a reporter's curiosity. If it was just reporter's curiosity, you'd be asking Morgan, correct? Maybe you should try thinking about what I want... For once. Serious? Oh, I better go check on her. Jane! OK. Thank you. OK. It has been over an hour. Come on, Jane. What happened. We broke up. You what? Why? I have no idea. Seriously, I don't. We were just talking about our boat date. I hinted maybe he could plan the next one. And then, he said that I don't find him romantic. And then we broke up. You broke up, broke up? Is there another kind? OK, well, this feels fixable. It's... it's just a miscommunication. Have your feelings changed? No. I still want to grow old with him and do all that stuff. But I didn't even get the chance to tell him that. And I don't think it makes sense now. You love him. What is going on? Nothing. OK. Tell me the facts. - One, two, pull the Band- - Aid off. It's just us. OK. Fact one, I really love him. Fact two, I'm scared out of my mind. OK. We will figure this out. It's going to be OK. Oh! Oh. I've not seen you this jealous since... I am not jealous. And do not mention Brian Hasbrook, Richy Rustem, or Buddy Manning. You already did. Oh, my... Well, really? Why are you here on a Sunday? I came to get my notes. I have an interview. Oh, well. A reporter's work is never done. Not in my case anyway. Were we supposed to meet today? Oh, no. I um... I came to get my notes. I have an interview in the park. This is Cecilia. Hi, you must be Audrey? Morgan's been... Complaining that I've been following him around? She's got your number. Yeah, well... Well, I should go. You going to do that all by yourself? I think I can manage. Oh. Nice to meet you, Cecilia. You too. She doesn't seem so bad. Mm-hmm. Morgan? You got a minute? Oh. I'll drop these on your desk. - Oh. - Meet you at the bodega? - OK. Thanks. OK. What's up? It's a solid deal. Is it? I mean, the money's not bad. The money is great. I could retire comfortably. And you wouldn't have to struggle through the transition or basically ever. And there's great structured payouts. Yeah. They're probably going to gut the company. Dennis assures me... I mean, unless they put down in writing that they're not going to fire everyone in the office, and they're going to upgrade our technology, and let us work as our own entity, and really actually invest in the paper, then yeah, maybe we could consider it. But I just think right now it's a bad deal. That is strange. Right? He was acting all weird, like I caught him in the act. But why does it matter? We are colleagues. And he is dating Cecilia. Still. Still, your heart? OK. Enough about me. Are you sticking with the plan? When are you having the talk with Howie? I'm just not quite ready. If you were fearless enough to give up your old life and move to Hope Cove to open a bed and breakfast, you can tell Howie how you feel. Suck it up buttercup. I never would have gone to the dance if Ask Aunt Hope hadn't told me to get out of the house. My heart had been broken. And I was hiding from the world. When I walked in the room, the minute I saw him, my heart started pounding. We only shared one dance. Then some big guy cut in, and she was gone. To console myself, I went to the farmer's market the next day. And there she was. Buying peaches for a pie. And when I went to pay, he paid for me. He was so sweet. We've been together ever since. You know, her advice was so beautiful... We used it in our wedding invitation, except for the Dear Broken Hearted. I think I brought a copy with me. All our lives, we're looking for home. If we're lucky, we'll find it in someone's loving arms. Love is coming home. Wow. That was really beautiful. Thank you. Mm-hmm. They're so sweet. Mm. They really are. And so in love. That's not us. I mean, we're not them. I mean... This isn't working. Yes. I'm sorry. I probably rushed things a little too fast, because... We're a certain age. Our parents were settled at this age. Trust me, I'm right there in that hole with you. Honestly, you are a great guy. Just not... The right guy. And I'm not the right girl. But I see how you look at Audrey. You should definitely give that a shot. The paper's history is steeped not only in the personalities and passions of its founders and their grandson, the new editor in chief Morgan Cooper, but also in the townspeople of Hope Cove. A community that was essentially brought together by the paper. A paper whose ideals of goodwill, neighborliness, fair play, courage, and open-mindedness are what Morgan strives to uphold and wears as his badge of honor. The integrity of the Hope Cove Beacon stems from the people of Hope Cove... This is the best thing you've ever written. You don't think it's too sappy? No. It's perfect. You're falling for Morgan. What? No. I am not falling for Morgan. We're just friends. If anything, I'm falling for the town. The town? You are falling for the town? Yes, the town. Ugh. OK. Let's see what Aunt Hope Has to say. OK. Dear Lost at Sea. Sometimes your life path doesn't take you all over an island to find your way. Sometimes it's standing in front of you like a beacon illuminating the place you were meant to be. Don't look past the present to find your future. Hmm. The beacon. Oh. Hi, Audrey. I didn't mean to bother you two. Oh, no, no. Not at all. I... I should be heading out. No. I didn't want to spoil the moment. I... No, you're not spoiling anything. It's fine. We do this every year for mom's birthday. She'd be thrilled that someone else showed up, instead of just us. You two enjoy the rest of the evening. Bye Clifton. I feel so bad. I think I just ran your dad off. Oh, do not. Do not feel bad at all. Dad would stay if he wanted to. He has overstayed many a welcome before. Wine? - Sure. Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - OK. So, thank you. Tell me about the wish lanterns. Oh. Well, every year we write one thing in the lantern and fly it off. And the birthday fairy grants your wish. I don't know. Which is something I've stopped believing after about 10. Hmm. It's really sweet. I'm almost done with my article. Would you take a look at it before I officially submit it? I'd be honored. OK. But you have to be brutally honest... Well, not too brutal, or you know, like nicely brutal. Why don't we just take brutal out of the equation? Great idea. OK. Were you serious about that job offer? Yes. Are you considering it? Maybe. I'm at a bit of a loose end. You know? I really thought that everything I wanted was tied up in the job at the Tribune... Bigger stories, bigger profiles. But I don't know. I feel a bit untethered. Well, that's life. You make plans. And then life changes around those plans. It's important to remember that you can pivot your trajectory to suit your needs in life first. I needed to hear that, I think. But you did it. You had the big job at the big paper. Is that something I need on my resume, do you think? Only you know what you want and need. But life should never be about what's on your resume. Yeah. It's getting pretty windy. And it's pretty late. We should probably get out of here. Yeah. It was nice running into you tonight. Yeah. Do you want to go to dinner with me tomorrow night? Like a... like a date? Or like just two friends, kind of grabbing a bite? Like a date. Aren't you and Cecilia a thing? Cecilia and I are nothing. We've decided to be friends. And leave it at that. Why? Is that the only thing holding you back from going on a date tomorrow night? Well, will we be partaking in the three B's? Bike riding, bocce, or baseball? Absolutely not. Then yes. OK. So tomorrow night then. Sounds good. All right. Well, I'll leave you to it. OK. Love you mom. So, other than Brian Hasbron breaking your heart at five, what is a life changing experience? Well, there was when my mom got sick. And then, there was the time on spring break my senior year of college that I jumped out of a plane. But I would have to say, OK. One morning, after a run with my ex, we went to brunch. And he made his usual breakfast order. Two eggs, one over easy, one over hard. And by hard, I mean, the yolk has to be cooked all the way through. Yeah. OK. And it just got me. And I thought, I can't spend the rest of my life with this smug know-it-all guy. And so, I broke up with him right then. Well, I'm glad I didn't order eggs for dinner. OK smarty pants. Your turn. OK. I'm six years old. Cousin Allison's wedding. Uh-huh. Obviously you know I'm not that great with crowds. I refused to walk down the aisle unless I was in my Superman costume. Pitched a fit. Huge meltdown. I thought I was going to be grounded for life. Turns out my cousin Allison didn't care one bit. And I realized on that day, that if something was making me feel uncomfortable, I had no choice but to voice my opinion, because it's the only way things would get better. Mm-hmm. Well, I bet you looked adorable. But if I don't see a picture, it didn't happen. Well, there's a picture. And it's in my father's office. Oh. OK, well, I would like to see that. - I - love that thing. Yeah. Me too. It's so cool. I had fun last night. Me too. Well, good. Would you like to do it again sometime? I... I was just headed to the Baker's Corner. Can I get you something? You buying? Well, you bought dinner. So yes. A couple dozen muffins ought to do it for the office. Well played. Yeah. Well played. I try my best. And when you get back, maybe you'll have an answer about dinner? I don't know? Think about it. Hmm. That's great. Thank you. You're not getting very far without this. You got to stop sneaking up on me like that. Thank you. I don't know what I was thinking. You need some company? Yeah. Hey Howie. Good morning. Will you excuse me a sec? We're here to get some muffins for the team. How's Jane? How are you doing? Confused. Really confused. About your feelings for Jane? No, never. She's the one. Have you told her that? I mean, I thought she knew. Are you still planning on treating? Yes. I will. Good luck, Howie. Thanks. If you don't tell her she's the one, she'll never know she's the one. Hey. How are you doing? I don't know. Howie called. He wants me to stop by the bakery. Now? No, tonight. That's great! Isn't it great? Depends on what happens. Oh. Will you come with me? You are a grown woman. And I know you can do this. Can you at least distract me? Definitely. OK. So I saw your Aunt Fanny take the notes from the suggestion box at the paper. And I am pretty sure that she is behind Ask Aunt hope. No. - Yes. - Really? Yes. Aunt Fanny? I know. I am going to go there tonight. And I am going to catch whoever it is in the act of posting that column for the Sunday edition. Well, look at you Nancy Drew. We'll see about that. Don't come to the paper tonight. Audrey knows. And she's determined to catch me in the act. Well, it's perfect, really. If I take the fall, she'll never know you've been my partner in crime. It won't jeopardize your stellar reputation, or you know, put you in newspaper jail. Yes. Gotta go. Hey dad. Hi son. There's a leak again. Same place. I think it's time to start considering changing the pipes. Sounds expensive. Hmm. Well, it's like grandpa said. If you pay for cheap, you get cheap. Do it right the first time so it lasts a lifetime. Well, he was a smart man. I guess you better get some estimates. I'll make some calls. Do you want a coffee? Sounds great. Double cream, member? Do it right so it lasts a lifetime. Right. There we go. Oh, Dennis, that was fast. Good to hear your voice. We got your signed contract. So that's all in motion. Very excited you're part of the team. And now we need to discuss something. Did you sign that contract? One second Dennis. Someone just came in. Did you get everything we wanted down in writing? No. Not all of it. But I trust Dennis. And now, I need you to trust me. Now you trust him? Sorry Dennis. What were you saying? No problem. There's one more thing. The Harrison Group is going to take the whole operation in-house. What? You're... you're disbanding the paper? We'll still keep a few key members of your staff. Uh, Morgan, Josh, Mary, Kate, and maybe Greg. What it means is, there is no autonomy. You will no longer have control of the day to day operations of the paper. You can't do that. Yes we can. The Hope Cove Beacon now belongs to the Harrison Group. The contract clearly states that your paper can be legally absorbed. Look. I've got to go. We can talk details in person tomorrow. Oh, and the big guy himself is coming with me. So be prepared. This can't be happening. No, I... I told you this was going to happen. And you told him about our staff? I... I... I thought it was the best decision for our family, for you, for the paper. And I never told him about our staff. It's fairly easy to assess our reporters. You just have to read their articles. Dad, were going to become a soulless version of our former self, just like every other paper that the Harrison Group owns. I knew it. Knew what? Don't give me that. You are the one behind Ask Aunt Hope. How long have you been writing this? When Millie took it over, I helped her out. And when Millie got sick, she asked me to take over. I see you figured it out. Yeah, I did. Does that mean you were lying the whole time? No. Honestly, I had no idea that Fanny had anything to do with Ask Aunt Hope. It's true. Millie swore me to secrecy. OK, fair. Although you have been lying to me. Me? Lying about what? Do not play that game. You came in here knowing full well that the Harrison Group was going to take over this company and kick us to the curb. I can't believe I trusted you. I can't believe I encouraged you. I can't believe in you. They are going to fire every single one of these people that work in this office. They're going to rip the heart out of Hope Cove. What did Dennis offer you? My job, I'm assuming. If you what? Feed him information about our staff? What are you talking about feed him information? About Aunt Fanny dressing up the statues, or Greg's surrogate having the baby early? I came here to cover a story. I may be a lot of things... Ambitious, too factual. But I am not some spy or turncoat looking to have fun on someone else's misfortunes. This is crazy Morgan. What, did Dennis tell you that I was feeding him information? Well, not exactly. Oh. So you jumped to conclusions. Probably. You know, I know that you take pride in making the human connection in your articles. But you really should have taken the time on this one to get your facts straight. I found her lurking. I was trying to make what I thought was a fast getaway. What? I'm sorry you and Morgan fought. It wasn't your fault. And obviously, we are not right for each other. Why would you say that? He's smart, kind, funny, selfless... Did he really not know it was you? He didn't. I think a part of him suspected. But it was keeping his mother alive somehow. So that was more important than knowing who was writing the column. Must have been so hard for him when his mom passed. Wish I could have been there for him then. You really care about him don't you. And you think you can go back to your old life and forget about him? Oh! Oh! He proposed! Oh my goodness! Oh, tell us! Tell us everything! It's a blur. It's just... he decorated the bakery with twinkle lights, and he had champagne. And there was this cake in the middle. And he made this really sweet speech about all my favorite flavors... Chocolate and coconut go together. And then he got down on one knee. Congratulations! Oh my goodness! What's up? I think I owe Morgan an apology. I've got to make this paper thing right. Paper thing? Maybe, as a wise woman once told me, you should suck it up buttercup and tell him you feel? Mitchell here. I can't believe you did this to them. Harper, come on. You know I don't run the show. Yeah right. You did this, because you don't like the fact that the Hope Cove Beacon is a better paper than the Tribune. It's business. Not personal. Hey, your article was fantastic. Great work. Excited about your promotion? I don't want it. Not like this. DENNIS MITCHELL: Come on Harper. It's an amazing opportunity. You can't turn it down. You'll never get this chance again. Think about it. I'll be there soon. We can talk. AUDREY HARPER: Yeah. We'll talk. Hi. I'm sorry for everything that I said. I didn't mean it. Yeah, me too. Except I meant it. What, you can't take a joke? On a beautiful day like this? I see you're already packed for your job at city desk. I'm not taking the job. Not like this. Car? Yeah. What do you got in here? Obviously the Harrison Group is not playing fair. We were stupid to trust Dennis in the first place. I can't ask you to not take a job that's going to help further your career. And besides, this mess has nothing to do with you. What if we tried changing their minds? It's never going to happen. It's all about the bottom line. I called the London Times. You're giving up on the paper? There's nothing left to give up on. 75 years of history, community... You really think they're going to keep Ask Aunt Hope around? It's gone. So that's it then? Yeah. You got to at least stay for the festival. Yeah. I'm going to go to the pie contest before I hit the road. I have to run some errands first. OK. Drive safe. You're really not going to tell him? I've already disappointed him enough. How can I tell him I'm Ask Aunt Hope? He's your son. He deserves to know that it's you who's been keeping Millie's spirit alive. You're Ask Aunt Hope? Ugh. That's going to make your retirement speech interesting. I suppose, Aunt Fanny was your cover. Yeah, technically. She helped her mom. And when she passed, she offered to help me keep the column going. We had some mishaps. But then we hit our stride. Thank you for keeping her alive for me. I know rationally that she's gone. But whenever I would read the column, it's like there she is. Just giving me honest, and sometimes unwanted, but perfect advice for most things in my life. It must have been pretty hard. Yeah. It was at first. But then, honestly, it was a gift. It felt like I was having conversations with your mom when I was working on the column. It kept her alive for me. Made her passing bittersweet. It helped with the grieving. Because somehow it felt like I was grieving with her, learning from her all over again. And every day, my heart was a little less broken. Dad. Thanks kid. It was delicious. You can't just leave. Tonight is the dinner and the dance. And the whole town is going to be there. And you'll get dressed up. And getting dressed up makes everything better. It's like you said to me, it is time to suck it up buttercup and let Morgan know how you feel... While you're wearing a cute little dress. And if you want some advice from someone who... Let's say, has lived a little... Never give up on anything... Especially love... Without a fight. I mean, every pie is just delicious. It's going to be a tough decision. But we'll announce the winner at tonight's dinner. Hey, Morgan. Need something to cleanse your palate after all those pies you tasted? Earth to Morgan. Come in Morgan. There he is. Sorry. Uh... congratulations on your engagement. That's great news. Thanks man. And thanks for the great advice. You know, tell a woman she's the one? She has no idea she's the one? Hey Howie, come here. I'll see you later. For so long I fought for a life I'd never know. And I guess, by now, I should finally let it go. Because the past don't last, and there's nothing else left to show. MORGAN COOPER Audrey. My whole life I wished for you and didn't know it. Morgan. I wouldn't change it. I would still give my all. I wouldn't walk away. Dennis. Ah. There she is. Audrey Harper, are you here to tell me that you're my new city desk reporter? I'm here to tell you that I quit. You were right. Hope Cove is a pretty special place. And I just can't live with what you're doing to this paper and this town. The unique point of view of the paper is what sets it apart. They choose not to invest in the bottom line, but in humanity. And to silence that now, when the world needs this paper more than ever, is a huge failure. Why would the Harrison Group choose to turn this gem into a lemming... In a long line of lemmings... In their own portfolio? Because we still shine brighter than any love I've known yet. We need to talk. This was supposed to be a done deal. Well, she's a real firecracker, huh? Uh-huh. Excellent. Thank you. Well, that's the most interesting... Morgan. So, I just spoke with the man himself, Mr. Eric Harrison. Seems we're not going to be absorbed after all. He wants us to continue our important work. His words, not mine. With complete autonomy in perpetuity. Seriously? Seriously. Seems a very opinionated Audrey convinced him. Dad. Great news. - Isn't that great? - That's great. I know. Good evening Hope Cove. Most of you clean up very well. And you know who you are. In all seriousness, this town is the heart of our paper. And much like the beacon on its masthead, its sole purpose is to provide a shining light for this community that has been such an inspiration to all of us. You know, it's kind of funny. This last week, I've been reminded just how special this town is by a certain someone. And I hope she feels the same way. My father, in the worst kept secret in town... If you haven't already heard... is retiring. Clifton Cooper... although I continuously beat you at checkers, no matter how hard I work, I will never be half the editor that you are. My only hope is that I continue to make you proud as I try to fill your enormous shoes. So cheers Dad. To Clifton Cooper. Oh, and sorry. One more thing. The winner of the pie contest is Deanna Glenn. Congratulations. Hear hear! There you are. Congratulations Mr. Editor in Chief. Thank you. Andrew Harper, you have to be the most remarkable, smart, kind, and yet opinionated woman that I've ever met in my entire life. You also happen to be an extraordinary reporter. Would you join me is co-editor in chief? Would you be interested? In you or the job? Both. It sounds like a pretty good life. So, did you get your wish? Not yet.
