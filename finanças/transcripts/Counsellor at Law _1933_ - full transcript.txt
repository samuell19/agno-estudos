Mr. McGee? Mr. McKee, K like in kitty? One moment, please. Mr. McKee of Barton and Barnard McKee calling Mr. Simon. Alrighty, go ahead. Mail, Henry! Can't you even assort it? Say, listen, how many people's work do you think I'm gonna do around here? Oh, you're not doing nothing. And look at all of these notices of trial I gotta get out. Alright, but you know what Mr. Tedesco said yesterday about letting the mail lay around. Simon and Tedesco. Who's calling, please? One moment, please. Mr. Hawthorne of the Chase National Bank calling Mr. Simon. Alrighty, go ahead. - Yes? - Is Mr. Tedesco in? - Have you an appointment? - Yes, I'm Mr. Moretti. Just a moment, please, I'll tell him you're here. - Hello. Mr. Moretti to see Mr. Tedesco. - Oh, Mr. Moretti! - Just a moment, Mr. Moretti. - Thank you very much. - E voi, che fai? Lo stesso. A vedere il Mr. Tedesco. Io no pu? capire como devo fare con l'appartamento che io non pu? pi? pagare. Lui sa che no posso fare niente. Tengo moglie e figlioli... - Bisogna pazienza. - Okay. Simon and Tedesco. Who's calling, please? One moment, please. - Mail, Mr. Weinberg. - Put it on that desk, please. - Here's your mail. - Well, it's about time. - Mr. Tedesco's been asking for it. - Well, you got it, ain't you? Don't be impudent to me, please. - Oh, veramente, campagno. - Cha-cha! Goldie, take a letter to the Itello Trading Company, attention Mr. Verdi. In receipt of yours of the 11th, we've come to the conclusion... ...that further delegation is unnecessary. Simon and Tedesco. Oh, it's you, is it? Gee, I thought you was dead and buried. Well, sure I missed you, like Booth missed Lincoln. Well, what do you think I've been doing, sitting home embroidering doilies? All right, now I'll tell one! - Is that Louie or Jack? - Mind your own business, you! Aw, just a fresh kid in the office here. - Hey, listen, call me back! - Good morning, Bessie! Good morning, Mrs. Chapman. How does it feel to be walking around again? It feels wonderful, Bessie. It's just as though I suddenly woke up from a bad dream. You can't imagine what I went through last night while that jury was out. Gee, I could never have lived through it. You sure must be feeling good this morning. I feel just like a new woman, that's how I feel. Gee, I bet you do after all you've been through. Good morning, Mrs. Chapman, congratulations. Thanks, Goldie. I'm so glad it's over. Of course after Mr. Simon talked to the jury, I had a feeling everything was going to be all right. - Why, Hello, Mrs. Chapman. - Hello, Henry! - I've got a bunch of mail for you. - Oh, thanks, Henry. You should have seen the stack that came this morning. Proposals of marriage and goodness knows what all. Well, all's well that ends well. I think I'll just sit down and read my letters. - Mr. Simon will be here soon. - Thanks, Bessie. Hello? What number? I'll get it right away. Oh, don't get up, please. there's plenty of room. Simon and Tedesco. Oh, hello, Gracie, I was just going to call you. Oh, not feeling so good today, Gracie. I don't know, my stomach don't feel so good. Must be something I ate. Say, listen, Fred just called me up. Yeah, sure you do, the one we met on the Iron Steamboat. Yeah, that's the one, wait a minute? Simon and Tedesco. Mr. Weinberg? One moment, please. Hello, Gracie, this is what I started to tell you. Hello? Oh, hello, Bob. Yes. For tonight? Yes, thanks very much. All right, good bye. Well, he wants me to go out with him tonight... Wait a minute, Gracie. Simon and Tedesco. Mr. Simon hasn't come in yet, I'll connect you with his secretary. Oh, good morning, Senator Wells. Mr. Simon's still in court. I'll tell him just as soon as he comes in. Come in. - Good morning, Miss Gordon. - Good morning, Mr. Weinberg. A friend just offered me two tickets to the Boston Symphony Orchestra tonight. - Would you care to go with me? - No, thank you very much, Mr. Weinberg. - Would you get out that stipulation? - I'll get it out right away. It's a very fine program. I thought perhaps you might have dinner with me somewhere... No, thank you, I really can't tonight. - Well, if you decide later in the day... - I'll let you know, Mr. Weinberg. Excuse me, please. Oh, I'll see you in a minute. Come in, Moretti. Subito. - Oh, Bessie, where's Goldie? - Just stepped outside, Mr. Tedesco. Well, tell her I want her, let me know when she does come in. Yes, sir. Simon and Tedesco. Who's calling, please? One moment, please. He's not in yet, come back later. This is Mr. Simon's secretary. - Good morning, Mrs. Chapman. - Good morning, Mr. McFadden. I've got a bunch of mail here for you. One of the keepers of the Tombs gave me. Just more letters. Did you ever hear anything more heartbreaking than that speach of Mr. Simon's to the jury? He was simply wonderful. I tell you there's nobody can come within a mile of him. Yeah, that's sure. Wait a minute. - Hey, Charlie! - What is it? Get me some lunch on the way back, will you? Alright, what do you want, make it quick. Tuna on rye and a chocolate malted. And tell him I want a lot of Russian dressing. - Alright. - Hello, I was just ordering my lunch. No, I don't think I'll go out today on account of my stomach. Yeah, I know... Wait a minute. Goldie, Mr. Tedesco wants you. He's been asking for you two or three times. - Did you have a nice weekend? - Oh, shut your mouth, you! Listen, I'm busy. Call me back. - Yes? - I'm Miss Lillian La Rue. I've got an appointment to see Mr. Simon. Well, he hasn't come in yet. Take a seat, won't you? Certainly. Miss Lillian La Rue to see Mr. Simon. Listen, I told you about Fred calling me up, didn't I? - Mr. Simon. - Yeah. Here, Henry. Well, listen. If you see Jack and he asks you about tonight, I was out with you, see? Yeah, I know, but in case you do. All right, Henry, go on, go on, there's Mr. Simon. Yes, ma'am. - G.S. is in. - I have to work, dear, I'll call you back. - G.S. is in. - G.S. is in. May I take a message? - Excuse me, lady, is he here now? - Yes, but I'm afraid he... Please, lady, my boy they take him in the Police Station. Yes, I know, Mr. Simon will see you soon now. Bessie, will you please get Senator Wells... ...at the Hotel Shoreham in Washington and then get those other numbers. Miss La Rue, Mr. Simon will see you in just a moment. - Oh, Miss Gordon... - I'm afraid you'll have to wait, Mrs. Chapman. Long distance, I want Washington D.C., Hotel Shoreham. No, Shoreham, S like in Sammy, H like on Henry, O like in Oscar, R like in Robert, E like in Edward, H like in Henry, A as in Adam, M as in Max, that's right. Yes. No, I tell you my client won't accept a penny less. I'm sorry too, good bye. - Mr. Crayfield. - Hello, Mr. Crayfield, how are you? Yes, I'll be here all day. Come in whenever you like. Are you getting Senator Wells, Rexy? - Yes, sir. - I want to talk to Mrs. Simon. - Hello John. - Hello, George. - Well, I see you put over the Chapman case. - Didn't I tell you I'd get an acquittal? Yes, but it looked pretty tough last night. Not after the bunch of buttonhole-makers on the jury got a good peek at it. I know how they felt about it, and I wouldn't mind having a little... Uh-huh, maybe I can fix it up for you. Oh, John! Hey, listen. I've decided to take a little trip abroad with Cora. We've been married 5 years on the 18th. I think I'll break away for once... ...and make a real celebration of it. You bet. - Lillian La Rue. - I bet she wasn't born Lillian La Rue. - Let her come in. - Alrighty. Miss La Rue, Mr. Simon will see you now. Thank you. - Senator Wells on the wire. - Take this down, Rexy! Good morning, Senator. Yeah, fine, fine. Thanks very much. That's the way with those murder cases. A lot of publicity and no money. Yes, yes, I did. As I explained to you, a decrease of 2c a pound will put my clients out of business. Don't get so excited, Senator, there's nothing illegal about lobbying, you know. If there were, you'd have to lock up half the people in Washington. No, I'm not trying to block up the entire bill, I'm merely acting in the interest of my clients... ...as you're acting in the interest of the people of Montana. Come in, Miss La Rue, sit down. Listen, Senator, why don't you have a good night's sleep and I'll write to you tomorrow. 12:30 the lawyers go up. Fine. And give my regards to that charming daughter of yours. Make a transcript of that and send it right out to Col. Widhammer. Good morning, Miss La Rue. Oh, Rexy... you'd better cut out that stuff about the murder cases, you know. And get Mr. Vanderbogart on the phone right away. - Have a chocolate cream. - Uh-uh, I'm on a diet. - But if you've got a cigarette. - Sure, there they are, help yourself. - Thanks. - Mrs. Simon on the phone. - Oh, excuse me a minute. - Sure. Hello, darling. Yes, I just got in. How are you, sweetheart? That's good. That's Mrs. Simon. She's one of the 400s, you know. Yes, I've seen her picture in the Sunday section. Oh, he worships the ground she walks on. She's got two children too. You know, from her first marriage. And talk about spoiled kids. And let me tell you something else... She goes... Simon and Tedesco. Why don't you come in and have lunch with me? Any time. That'll be fine. All right, darling. Good bye, sweetheart. What a wonderful woman that is. - Here she is, my wife. - Yeah, you showed it to me the last time. Hm... Mr. Vanderbogart on number 2. There's Schyler's lawyer now! Good morning, Mr. Vanderbogart. Any word for me about the little lady in the breech-of-promise case? I don't think 10,000 would be acceptable to my client... I should say not! Frankly, I don't think I could conscienciously advise her to take it. As a matter of fact, she's sitting here in my office and I don't mind telling you... She's taking this thing very much to heart. Well, Schyler met her at a nightclub not a convent. Well, it might be rather embarrassing to the Schyler family if those letters were... Two days? Yes, I can wait two days. Thank you. Good bye, Mr. Vanderbogart. Give my regards to Mr. Woodrich. Ten thousand, so that's what they expect me to take. Well, they seem to think you'd been a little indiscreet before you met Schyler. What did they expect for $10,000? I think they'll pay twenty. Call me up in two or three days. All right, I'll give you a ring. That's my idea of a nice, sweet little girl. Is that Chapman woman waiting? - Yes, and Mrs. Becker. - Well, let me get rid of Chapman first. - Mrs. Richter on the phone. - Hmmm... Hello, Mrs. Richter. How's the baby's cough? Oh, that's fine. Well, I've got some good news for you. How much do you think I got? Better than that. A thousand a week. Say, kid, that's some run you've got in your stocking. Where? Oh, gee. Now, wouldn't that give you a pain? And I just put them on clean this morning. I'll buy a new pair if you let me put them on for you. Say, listen, one more crack like that out of you and you'll get a good smack in the face. - Get hot, get hot. - Well, just remember, that's all. Yes, Miss Gordon? Alrighty. Mr. Simon will see you now, Mrs. Chapman. All right, Mrs. Richter. No, no, no, no, no. Don't mention it. How much of a retainer did we get from Mrs. Richter? - Twenty-five hundred. - Yes? As soon as the agreement is signed, send her a bill for five thousand. I want her to get it while she's still grateful. Come in. That's all right, ma'am. I was delighted to be able to get it for you. Good bye. Have Weinberg get busy on that agreement. Come in, Isadora, sit down. Hello, George, darling. I thought you were never going to see me. I've been pretty busy. What's on your mind, anything special? No, nothing special. I just came to tell you how wonderful it is to be a free woman again and... ...to have a little chat. - Well, I have a lot of clients waiting... - Oh, let them wait. Hm. - Please, lady. - Just a little while now, Mrs. Becker. Thanks, Henry. Mr. Weinberg, Mr. Simon wants you... ...to get that Richter separation agreement out right away. All right, I'll dictate it this afternoon. - Thank you. - Miss Gordon. - Well? Won't you change your mind about going to the concert tonight? I've already told you I don't care to go, Mr. Weinberg. Why is my society so distasteful to you? It isn't that, I just don't care to go, that's all. I suppose if the great G.S. proposed, you wouldn't refuse. Please keep your remarks to yourself. Don't forget about that agreement, Mr. Weinberg. # Just break the news to Mother # # Tell her how much I love her # # There'll never be another # # Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da # Oh, George, after all those wonderful things you said about me to the jury. It made me feel that you were the only man who ever really understood me. Well, anyway, I understand juries. Why are you so cold to me? Oh, George, dear, I've grown so terribly fond of you. Say, what the... What's the idea of this anyway? I was engaged to defend you on the charge of murdering your husband. There's nothing in the retainer requires me to make love to you. - Shut your mouth, you... - That's the way out. Good morning. Why do you leave me alone with that woman? - I thought it might be something personal. - Personal? Phooey! That's the last one of those female murder cases I'll ever handle. All right, I'll see Mrs. Becker now. Hello, John, are you alone? Hey, listen, I just got a hot tip from Washington. The Supreme Court's reversing the Lower Court in the Golf Coast Utilities case. No, neither did I. Say, let's take a little flier on the stock. Five thousand shares? Fifty-fifty. All right, keep it under your hat. I'll telephone Joe Fisherman right away. Hello, get me Joe Fisherman, please. All right, Mrs. Becker, Mr. Simon will see you now. - Thank you. - Mr. Fisherman, please. Hello, Mr. Fisherman, one moment, please, Mr. Simon calling. Mr. Fisherman, Mr. Simon. Alrighty, go ahead. Yes? Would you please tell Mr. Simon that Mr. Roy Darwin would like to see him? - Have you an appointment? - Why, no, I haven't. Well, just a moment, please, I'll tell his secretary you're here. Thanks. Yeah, that's right. No, no information, just a hunch, that's all. I know it's a rotten stock. Well, if I lose, I only got myself to blame. All right, Joe. And listen, don't buy it all in one block. Okay, so long. Hello, Mrs. Becker, glad to see you, come right in. - Good morning. - Sit down, sit down. Gee, you look fine. How's your husband? You mean Troy? He's already dead six years. Oh, that's terrible. Who's looking after you now? When mine boy Harry is working, everything is alright. Is Harry old enough to work? The last time I saw him, he was in a baby carriage. - How is he, a good boy? - Yes, he's a good boy. Only all the time he's getting into trouble. What kind of trouble, with girls? No, no, Counsellor. Only all the time he's making speeches. There should be in America a revolution. What do you mean? Harry goes around making communist speeches? All the time. And yesterday he's making in the Union Square a speech, a policeman comes, and hits him with such a club in the head... ...and then they put him in the Police Station. - Is he arrested? - Yes. Counsellor, you wouldn't let them send my boy to prison. Oh, now, don't worry, don't worry. We won't let them take him to prison. You just leave everything to me. Oh, Counsellor, every night I'm going to say for you a prayer. Oh, here, here, Mama Becker. Why, we're old friends. Don't you remember we used to live in the same house together? Here. Here, take this. - No, no, I couldn't take it. - Take it, take it. Buy yourself some groceries. Thanks, Counsellor, thanks. - Just this way, Mrs. Becker. - Thank you, Lady. - Oh, no, thank you, really. - Please. Please, you take. Well, thank you very much. Good bye. That's a fine joke, that is. The cops beat up a kid for making a speech then they arrest him. Say, listen, Rexy, this is what I want you to do. Have somebody go bail for him... ...and find out the name of the assistant district attorney in charge. Yes, sir. Here's your tuna on rye and chocolate malted. Thanks, Charlie, did you tell him to put a lot of Russian dressing on it? Yeah, he smeared it on plenty. - Going up. - No, down. Yeah... Yeah, I understand that, but... I don't see how I can handle it. You can't expect me to represent the principal creditor... ...in a proceeding in which my partner's the receiver. Sit down. I don't have to think it over. Why? Because that isn't the way I practice law, Mr. Littlefield. It's absolutely final. I can have nothing to do with it. So am I, good bye, sir. - Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Darwin. - Oh, I'm in no great hurry. - Excuse me, Mr. Crayfield is here. - I'll see him in a few minutes. Pardon me, but was that Rigby Crayfield? - Yes, it is. - Well, I don't mean to be impertinent, but I understand that you've been retained for the purpose... ...of breaking Edward Crayfield's will. - I'm sorry, but afraid I can't discuss... - Of course not. You see, this will contest would involve Edward's widow in rather a painful scandal. She's a first cousin if mine and a friend of Cora's too. My wife would be the last person in the world, Mr. Darwin, to expect me to give up an important case because she happens to be... ...a friend of one of the interested parties. I'm sorry I can't oblige you. Well, if you can't, you can't. Oh, by the way, I wonder if you could help me out of a temporary embarrassment. You see, I happen to be rather a heavy holder of Amalgamated Zinc, and I've just learned that the miserable beggars have gone out past their quarterly dividend. So for the moment, you see, I... - How much do you need? - Oh, a couple of thousand or so. - I guess we can manage that. - Well, thanks very much. Come in tomorrow morning. My secretary will have a check for you. - Oh. Well, so long, old man. - Good bye. - Thanks very much. - Not at all. Shall I tell Mr. Crayfield to come in now? Yeah. Make out a check for $2,000 to the order of Roy Darwin. And a promissory note payable in three months. - Yes, sir. - How much, um... ...of a bill did I tell you to send Mrs. Richter? Five thousand dollars. No, you'd better make it $7,500. Yes, sir. - Hello, Cora! - Why, hello, Roy, what are you doing here? Why, there was something I wanted to talk over with George. You know, the Crayfield matter. Oh, yes, Wilma called me up this morning, she's in a terrible state. Yes, I know, but George is absolutely firm. Think how awful it would be for poor Wilma. Tell me, Cora, is George really going to Europe with you? - Yes. - Well, when am I going to see you? Why, I don't know exactly. - Can't we have tea some time? - Yes. - Today. - Oh, not today, I'm having tea with Wilma. Oh, can't I join you? - Well, all right. Four at the Plaza? - All right. - Au revoir then. - Au revoir. Down, please. - Good morning, Miss Gordon. - Good morning, Mrs. Simon. Mr. Simon is busy with a client, but I'll tell him you're here. No, never mind, I have several phone calls to make. Wait a while, sir. Will you take the board now, I want to get my lunch. Aw, come on! - Is Mr. Simon busy, please? - Yes, he is. Would anyone else do? - I'll wait for him. - He may be busy for quite a while. Oh, that's all right, I can wait. I got plenty time. - All right, take a seat. - Thank you. Hello, Mr. Morell of the French Line? Just a minute, please. Mr. Morell? This is Mrs. George Simon. I want to inquire if our suite on the ?le de France has a serving pantry. It has? Well, than you. And I wish you to arrange to have a steward named Marcel LeBon. LeBon, that's right. He served me several times before... ...and I prefer to have someone who's familiar with my requirements. Thank you. Excuse me, madam, ain't you Mr. Simon's mother? - Yes. - I'm Charlie McFadden. I's used to be the help at the bar or the plumber over on 3rd Ave. Oh, yes, of course. Well, what do you think of that? Sit down, Mr. McFadden. Say, you don't look a day older than the last time I saw you. Oh, you're a darling. Well, I got my health, thank God, and my boy gives me every comfort. - He's a prince among men, that's what he is. - Yes, that's what he is, Mr. McFadden. I guess you know what he done for me, don't you? Oh, I know how to mind my own business, Mr. McFadden. - You know, I was nothing but a jailbird. - Tsk tsk tsk. Yes, sure! I met him on the street one day, and he says to me: "Charlie, if you go straight, I'll give you a job in the office." So, I took him at his word and here I've been for four years now. - Yes? - Process server. And now and again I do a little private detective work. You see, I've got ways of finding things out. What do you think of that? Wherefore, said contestants pray that said document... ...purporting to be the last will and testament of Edward Crayfield, ...be not admitted to probate. That's all. Leave everything else, go and get those papers back to me... - ...for correction just as soon as you can. - Yes, sir. Now, Mr. Crayfield, I've got to... I've got to ask you some rather intimate questions. Certainly. County clerk Peter J. Malone to see Mr. Simon. - Yes, sir, just take a seat, Mr. Malone. - All right. County Court Malone to see Mr. Simon. - Just a few minutes, Mr. Malone. - Okay. What's the matter, Mr. Malone, don't you remember your old friend? Well, will you look who's sitting there. I didn't see you at all. What's the matter, did I shrink too much you couldn't see me? No, I thought it was a young girl sitting there. You're not one of them expensive Park Avenue divorce cases of George's? Yes, you're a fine one, you are. Why, I ain't seen you since the Dewey Parade. - How are you anyhow? - Oh, I'm fine. And about you I don't have to ask. Yeah, quite a bay window. Well, we're all a little better off today than in the old days in Yonkers. I'll say we are, me driving a truck... ...and you running a little bakery and George selling papers. Say, you ought to be mighty proud of your son, Mrs. Simon. Excuse me, madam, are you Mr. Simon's mother? Yes. Oh, I'll tell him you're here. I didn't know who you were. That's alright, I can wait, I got plenty time. Looks like an absolutely tight case. She'll have those papers out in about half an hour. I'll send them right over to your office. Thank you. Good bye, Mr. Simon. - Good bye, Mr. Richter. - Hello, George! Hello, Pete, how... Hello, Mama! I didn't know you were here. Why didn't you tell me my mother was waiting? Very sorry, Mr. Simon, I didn't know the lady was your mother. Going out for his bar examination, can't even announce a caller. Go ahead, Mama. Come in, Pete. No, I got a call to make. Where's a phone I can use? Right there in the library. See Mr. Malone gets his number. Yes, sir. What number is it you want, Mr. Malone? - I want the Capitol in Albany. - Yes, sir. Ma, you coming down to the boat to see us off? Fine. All right, see you then. - Hello, darling. - Hello, George. Come right in. Well, I still have one or two phone calls to make. All right, sweetheart, come in whenever you're through. Gee, you smell good. You know, Georgie, that's a nice girl that Miss Gordon. Uh-huh. How is it a fine girl like that doesn't find herself a husband? I don't know, Mama. Have a piece of candy. - No, thanks, Georgie. - They're good. Georgie, you'll spoil your lunch gnashing like that. How can one piece of candy spoil my lunch? - Now, Georgie! - Say, Mama, - Remember Sarah Becker from 2nd Avenue? - Becker? Becker? Sure, her husband had a pushcart on the corner of Houston St. Oh, yes, of course, of course. They had a little baby with the red curls. Little Harry. Little Harry. That's the one, little Harry. Well, little Harry's been getting himself into trouble... ...going around making communist speeches. What, that little baby? I can't believe it. What a nar you are, Mama. He wouldn't stay a little baby all these years. Yes. Yes. Excuse me a moment, Miss Gordon, do you mind? - Certainly. - Now what did you say, Helen? No. No, no, tell me all about it now. Listen, Georgie, I got to talk to you something. What's the matter, Mama, anything wrong? Don't you fell all right? Of course I'm feeling alright, Georgie, you mustn't worry about me. Listen, Georgie, you promise you won't be angry? I wouldn't be angry, Mama. What is it? Listen, Georgie... Davy called me up this morning. - Well? - Well, you said you wouldn't be angry. - I'm not angry. - Sure, your'e not angry, you're not angry! What is it? Well, he's in trouble, he needs a little help. I bet he does. What does he need it for this time? A check came back from the bank. You mean he slipped someone a bum check. No, no, he just made a little mistake with his balance. Yes, he did. He's just a dirty crook that's what he is. Dirty, is that a way to talk about your brother? A fine brother he is. All he does is one rotten crooked thing after the other, the gonner. I'm through with him! Georgie, please, be a good boy, it's the last time... Oh, how many times have I heard that? That louse boob gives me more headaches than all the rest of my practice put together. I'm supposed to be an important lawyer around here. People from all families come and think I'm doing them a favor... ...if I accept their retainers. It's a fine thing for me, isn't it, to have a brother that gets pinched in gambling raids, annoying women in the subways, passing out rubber checks. - It won't happen again. - No, I've done all I'm going to do. - Georgie, for me! - No, I'm through! Georgie, you know I wouldn't ask... - No, no... Now, Georgie, please... - No! - Sorry, I didn't know you were busy. - That's all right, darling, come right in. - How do you do, Mrs. Simon? - I'm very well, thank you, and you? I'm well, thanks. Will you excuse me a minute, I'll be right back. Say, Rexy, write down that Mrs. Becker's address for my mother. How are you getting along? Is that all you've done? What's been holding you up? Come on, come on, we can't keep Crayfield waiting all day. We promised him this stuff in half an hour. And your children, are they well too? Yes, quite well, thanks Well, I'm gald that Georgie is going to have a little vacation. - He works so hard. - Yes, too hard, in fact. He always worked hard, since he was a little boy. Always working and studying and trying to better himself. Well, I think I'll go home now. But maybe I'll see you again before you go to Europe. - Well, I hope so. - But in case I don't, I hope you have a wonderful trip, in peace. Take good care of my Georgie. - I'll do my best. - Good bye. Good bye. - How do you do, Mrs. Simon. - Oh, hello, Miss Gordon. - Going, Mama? - Yes, Georgie. Give my mother that address, Rexy. Good bye, Mama. - Good bye, Georgie. - Take a taxi uptown. Oh, the bus is good enough. Georgie! - Huh? - Please, don't forget what I asked you. Okay. - Here's the address. - Thanks. - My but you're looking well. - Oh, I can't complain. I'm not getting any younger, but otherwise I'm fine. I'm coming up to pay you a little visit real soon. Oh, that's going to be very, very nice. Come any time. I don't go out so very often. - Good bye. - Good bye. Good bye. George, you're not thinking seriously... ...of trying to break that Crayfield will, are you? Yes, darling, very seriously. But George, I can't understand why you want to have anything to do... ...with such a scandalous case. Because there's a hundred-thousand dollar fee in it. But you don't need the money. And think of what it would do to poor Wilma Crayfield. She's been a friend of mine for years. Why, she's even dined at our house. Well, so have hundreds of other people. Does that mean I can't take any case that involves their interest? That's a pretty high price to pay for having people to dinner. Well, at least you would have made a magnanimous gesture. I should say so. A hundred thousand dollars. That's not the way law is practiced, darling. Well, I don't see why it isn't possible to practice law like a gentleman. Hm. I never laid any claims to being a gentleman. The last time I crossed the Atlantic was in a steerage. I didn't mean it that way. Heavens, George, nobody admires you more than I do for all the handicaps you've overcome. I guess I gave a good demonstration of that, didn't I, when I made that runaway marriage with you. Remember I told you from the start I wasn't good enough for you. You see, it's a little embarrassing for me... ...having your name always associated with these sensational cases. Darling, the last thing in the world I want to do is to cause you any embarrassment. Listen, sweetheart, would it make you any happier... ...if I dropped the Crayfield case entirely? Take this letter to Rigby Crayfield, Rexy. My dear Mr. Crayfield, I regret to inform you it will be impossible for me to represent you... ...in the matter of the probate of the will of Edward Crayfield. My reasons for withdrawing from the case... have nothing to do with the merits of your claim... but are of a purely personal nature, the, um... details of which I shall not burden you with. I'm enclosing herewith all the papers of the matter of which kindly acknowledge receipt. Regretting any inconvenience I may have caused you, I am, etc, etc... Get that right out and send it over by a messenger. Thank you, George. Well, darling, you'll make a gentleman of me yet. Do I rate a kiss? No, no, I can't. What? Well, just a minute, I'll ask the mayor if it's alright with him. Is it alright with you, Your Honor? Yeah, the mayor says it's okay with him. Alright. I'm going to lunch. Alright, beautiful, can you be reached at the automat? You're very funny, I don't think. Oh, Miss Gordon, please phone to the Margrey... ...and say that I'm on my way and that I want a table for two? Certainly. Hello, Pete, what's on your mind? - Wipe the paint off your mouth. - What? - I've just been kissing my wife. - Well, I'm glad there's some that still do. Pete, I'm glad you came in, there's something I want to talk to you about. You know, I think John Tedesco has a Supreme Court nomination coming to him. - What? - Why not, he's worked mighty hard... - ...for the organization John has. - I know, but there's been a lot of bellyaching lately about keeping the bench out of politics. We gotta get A-one men. Now, if it was you, George. Nothing doing, Pete, what would I want to be a judge for? I'd get corns sitting up there all day on my bottom. - John ain't so hot on the legal end, is he? - Neither am I. But I got a young Harvard boy in the office named Weinberg He can be John's secretary. And believe me, he'll hand down opinions... ...that'll give the court of appeals an inferiority complex. Well, I'll think it over. Maybe we can work it. Tell you why I came in, George. You know my brother Ed, the warden up at Auburn. - Sure. - Well, he tipped me off to something... ...that I think you ought to know. Do you remember handling a case for a fellow named Breitstein? Sure I remember. Johan Breitstein, a German boy. I defended him on a larceny charge, got an acquittal. Was there something about an alibi? Yeah, he had an airtight alibi. Well, it seems there was a fellow named Whitey Kushman... who was mixed up in the case, is that right? Yeah, he established the alibi for Breitstein. Well, this Kushman is doing a stretch up at Auburn. And according to my brother Ed, he's been giving one of the members of the parole board, a lawyer by the name of Francis Clark Baird, some song and dance about the alibi in the Breitstein case being framed up. What do you mean framed up? I'm just telling you what Ed told me over the phone last night. He says he's got a hunch that Baird would like to get something on you. Sure he would, I've licked him to a failure over half a dozen cases. What's Baird got to do with this? Ain't he on the grievance committee of the Bar Association too? - Yeah, I think he is. - Well, that's what Ed said. Baird thinks he can cook up some kind of a disbarment proceeding... ...against you out of this Breitstein case. Oh, he does, does he, well let him try it, what do I care, he's got nothing on me. Well, that's what I told Ed. George is too smart a boy, I says, to let himself get mixed up with anything like that. Francis Clark Baird. He and the rest of those silk-stocking babies in the Bar Association... ...have been gunning for me for years, but they haven't got anything on me yet. No, and they never will. Disbar me on a crook's deposition eh? - That's a hot one, that is. - Well, it's just like I told Ed. Those guys that came over on the Mayflower... ...don't like to see the boys from 2nd Avenue sitting in the high places. They've had their knives out for me for a long time too. Ha, but it's me that has the laugh when the votes are counted. Well, George, I just wanted to give you the lowdown. - Thanks for tipping me off. - Keep the change. - So long, Pete. - Salaam Aleikum. Rexy, I want you to get a hold of a fellow named Johan Breitstein. I defended him eight or nine years ago on a larceny charge. The last I heard of him he was an usher at the Capital Theater. See if you can trace him. Get him in here as soon as possible. Let everything else go till you locate him, understand? - Yes, sir. - I'm going to lunch with Mrs. Simon. - Have McFadden help you. - Yes, sir. Hello, give me the Capital Theater, please. Twenty-seven out. - Good morning. - Good morning. Simon and Tedesco. Bessie ain't here. She's taking a rest. No, she's laying down. I don't know. She ain't feeling so good today. What? Well, how should I know? Here, Bessie, something to quiet your nerves. - Does it taste bad? - No, drink it, it'll make you feel better. Oh, I hate taking stuff. - You'd better go home, Bessie. - No, I'm alright. Good morning. What's the matter, something wrong? Bessie had a little shock and it upset her. Better jump into a tax, Bessie, and go home. No, I'm alright, Mr. Simon, I'm going back to the board now. Listen, if you're not alright, I want you to go home. No, I'm alright, honest I am. Thanks, Miss Gordon. Get me Francis Clark Baird. What's the matter with her? She saw someone jump out the window of an office building. Gee, that's awful. Imagine anyone doing a thing like that. Well, if you're tired of living, I guess it's as good a way out as any. Hey, what's the matter with you? Why are you so morbid all of a sudden, don't you feel well or something? Yes, of course, I'm just talking nonsense, that's all. - Is Breitstein here? - Yes, sir, he's waiting outside. Have him come in. I'll take this. Hello! Hello, Mr. Baird? When do you expect him? Well, aren't you likely to hear from him some time during the day? Mr. Breitstein, Mr. Simon will see you now. Thanks. It's all very indefinite, isn't it? Yeah, good bye. You'd think he could afford a more convincing liar than that. Well, where's Breitstein, isn't he coming in? Yes, sir. - Hello, Mr. Simon. - Hello, Breitstein, how are you? - Glad to see you, sit down, how've you been? - I'm fine, Mr. Simon, I've got a good job now. I'll tell you why I asked you to come in. - Have a cigarette, or a cigar? - Thanks, I'll take a cigarette. Breitstein, has anybody been talking to you lately about that case of yours? Why, no, Mr. Simon, they haven't. Nobody approached you, asked you any questions? No, sir, why, is anything wrong? The reason I sent you is to put you on your guard. I hear this fellow Kushman's been doing some talking. - Kushman? - Yeah, you know, your old pal, Whitey Kushman, who established the alibi for you. Why, he's up at Auburn doing 20 years for manslaughter. I now it. But he's been telling people we cooked up that alibi. Gee-whiz. Does that mean they're going to come after me again? Yeah, they're likely to. Holy smoke, Mr. Simon, what am I going to do? Don't get excited, Breitstein, baby. Everything will be all right... ...if you do just as I tell you to do. Sure, I will, Mr. Simon. Gee-whiz, I've got a wife and family now, Mr. Simon. I don't know what I'd do... What you've got to do is to stick by that alibi story. Understand? Yes, sure. Whatever you say. And, um... I'll do the best I can for you, but we've got to stick together, Breitstein. It may just happen that somebody'd try and make trouble for me too. For you, Mr. Simon? Yeah, I took an awful chance getting you out of that jam you were in. Gosh, Mr. Simon, I don't want you to get in any trouble on account of me. Everything I've got I owe to you. If it weren't for you, I'd be in for life. I'd go through fire and water for you. All right, Breitstein, thanks. I knew I could count on you. If anyone questions you, just stick to your story and act dumb. You betcha. And do you think everything's going to be alright? Well, I hope it is. Why, don't you? Oh, yes, sure. Only I was just thinking... - What? - I was thinking in case they looked up... ...the hospital records. - What hospital records. - The hospital records of Whitey Kushman. What hospital records of Whi... What are you talking about? Well, you know, the day it happened, the day he said I was in his house? - Yeah? - Well, he was in the hospital. You mean the day you were at the bathhouse, Whitey Kushman was in the hospital? - Yes, Mr. Simon. - Are you sure of this, Breitstein? Yes, sir, I thought you knew all about it. I never even heard of it! Holy! Wow! Hm, I gotta think about this. What hospital was it, do you know? I think it was the Polyclinic. Mr. Simon Well, I may have to ask you to come in again. Good bye. Good bye, Mr. Simon. I hope everything's going to be alright. Yeah, so do I. Come in. Here's that list of your separation agreement, Miss Gordon. Thank you. - Aren't you feeling well today? - Yes, of course. You don't look very well. I wish you wouldn't worry so much about me, Mr. Weinberg. You might as well be civil to me. Everywhere else I go people treat me with civility. I try to be civil to everybody, Mr. Weinberg, but I can't sit here all day talking about nothing, Excuse me, I'm sorry. Hello? Oh, just a moment, Mrs. Simon. Mrs. Simon on the wire. Listen, dear, I've got a little bad news for you. I'm afraid I'll have to postpone the trip to Europe. I can't tell you exactly over the telephone. Why don't you come in? Well, that's all right, bring them along. That's fine. All right, good bye, sweetheart. Yes, George? Hey, John, I want to talk to you about something, can I come right over? Certainly, George. - Rexy. - Yes, sir. I'm going across town for a few minutes. When Mrs. Simon comes, - tell her I'll be right back. - All right, sir. - Good morning, Counsellor. - Can't see you now, you'll have to wait. Yeah. All right, I'll call you back later. - Well, George? - Listen, John, I'm in a bad spot. - You know Francis Clark Baird, don't you? - Yeah. A cornerstone of the Union League and they're going to break me. What do you mean he's got something on you? Well, I once helped a kid out of a jam by putting over a fake alibi. - You what? - I'll tell you how it happened. A fellow named Breitstein had stolen some money from a bathhouse locker. I'd known the kid and his family for years. I advised him to plead guilty and get off with a couple of months. Then I discovered that Breitstein was the fourth offender... ...under conviction and a life sentence. I didn't know what to do. Finally he said he could get a fellow named Whitey Kushman... ...to swear he was with him at his house in Jamaica the day of the robbery. I couldn't refuse, John. I knew he'd go straight if I got him off, and he has too. I just couldn't see that kid get a life sentence. Just like a sucker I went into it. Breitstein was just in here. They can't do anything to him, of course. But they got me sewed up good and proper. - This fellow Breitstein been squealing? - No, Kushman. He's doing a stretch up at Auburn and he spilled the whole story to Baird. To Baird? And Baird's promised to help him get a parole. And to top it off... ...Breitstein just told me that Whitey Kushman was in the hospital the day of the robbery. - Gee! - Can you see what that does to me? When Baird puts this thing before the grievance committee, I can kiss my career good bye, they'll disbar me as sure as... Disbarment. I don't think I could face it. No, George, I've got to get you out of it. Now give me some time to think about it, will you? That's what I want you to do, John. Now I'll go over to the hospital and dig up those records. ??? Who's calling, please? Wilson and DeBurr? One moment, please, I'll connect you with Mr. Weinberg. Hello? Bank of America? Mr. Grover, please. Simon and Tedesco calling. Mr. Wilson? One moment, please. Simon and Tedesco calling... Come in. - Yes? - Excuse me, Mr. Tedesco. What is it, Rexy? I don't want to be inquisitive, but I have this feeling... ...that Mr. Simon is in some kind of trouble. Is he? Trouble, no, he's not in any trouble. I know it's none of my business and I shouldn't have asked. But I just wanted to tell you if there's anything I can do. I guess Mr. Simon knows that, Rexy. There's really nothing to worry about. Yes? Thank you. Miss Gordon, will you have lunch with me today? - I can't, I have some shopping to do. - You don't think up some clever excuses. Well, we can't all be clever, Mr. Weinberg. It isn't necessary to be sarcastic, Miss Gordon. - Really, Mr. Weinberg! - I know what your opinion of me is. Oh, what's the use. I'll have to ask you to excuse me, I'm very busy. Oh, Bessie, get me the County Lawyers Association, will you, please? I'll get you a wire. How are you, Duchess? - How do you do, Mrs. Simon? - How do you do, Bessie? Hello, Dorothy, hello Richard. Mr. Simon isn't in just now, Mrs. Simon, but I think he'll be back soon. - But I can't understand his not being here. - I'll tell Miss Gordon you're here. Good morning, Mrs. Simon, good morning, miss, good morning, young man. - Good morning. - Well, you sure are grown up the two of you. The last time I saw them, ma'am, they were little bits of sugarplums. People always make such original remarks about how big you're getting. What do they expect you to do, get smaller? - Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Simon? - How do you do, Mr. Tedesco? Richard, Dorothy, this is Mr. Tedesco. - Hello, Dorothy, hello, Richard. - How do you do? Well, I didn't expect them to be so grown up. Alrighty. Mrs. Simon, Miss Gordon said would you kindly wait in Mr. Simon's office? Thank you. - Do you mind if we wait out here, Mother? - Yes! If you like, I shan't be long. Have a little patience, Harry, he's coming soon. Goldie, Mr. Tedesco wants you, he's in the library. Goodness, are these the little Simon children? - I'm Richard Dwight Junior. - And I'm Dorothy Dwight. Oh, I guess they still keep their father's name. But haven't they grown, though? Well, you're both very nice-looking children. Good bye. Well, I suppose you'll be having lunch with your father today. - Our father lives in Washington. - I mean Mr. Simon. He's not our father. Good morning, Mr. Darwin, I have those papers for you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Roy. Hello, Cora. I always seem to be running into you here. Well, I had a tiresome little business matter to dispose of. How are you today? You look a little disturbed. Oh, I am. Now George tells me he can't go to Europe. - Oh, really? - Oh, some business matter.. ...or something has come up. But that's George for you. So impulsive and impetuous, but... Heavens, I don't know why I should bore you with my troubles. But you know I'm interested. Funny, you know, I've been thinking of going to Europe myself. - Have you, Roy? - Hm-hmm. Chiefly in the hope of running into you somewhere, I confess. That would have been very nice. When would you be going if you did go? Oh, in a week or ten days, there's nothing to keep me here. Well, if you go to l?-bas, be sure and motor over to Dinard and St. Malo. Oh, um... would you mind getting me that magazine, please? - This? - Yes, please. Thank you. Who's that? Oh, some errand boy, or office boy, I guess. Would you like to be an errand boy? Of course not, don't ask such silly questions! Harry, what's the matter, Harry? Be a good boy, sit down, he's coming soon. - Will you have tea with me? - Oh, I can't today. - Tomorrow. - Well, I wasn't coming in. Why don't you drive out to the country and have lunch with me? - Oh, I'd love to. Is it all right? - Yes, I think so. Oh, hello, darling. I saw the car downstairs. - Hello, Mr. Darwin. - Hello, George. I was just keeping Cora company until you got back. - I'm sorry to keep you waiting, darling. - It doesn't matter. Roy, I wonder if you'd mind taking the children to lunch. I don't like to have them sitting out there so long. I don't think it's a very good atmosphere for them. - Yes, I'd be delighted. - Are the children here? - Wait, I'll have them come in. - Don't bother, Roy'll pick them up outside. I thought I'd like to say hello to them. Have my son and daughter come in. I don't have as much time to spend with the children as I'd like to. - Shall I take them to the Biltmore? - Yes, and I'll charge you there. Hello, strangers, I haven't seen you for a month of Sundays. - Hello. - How's my young lady today? Oh, I'm all right. Roy's going to take you to the Biltmore for lunch. Oh, why not the Ritz? I like the Ritz much better. - So do I. - We can make it the Ritz just as well. All right, old dears, come along. - Good bye. - Good bye. Good bye. They get along pretty well with Mr. Darwin, don't they? I don't want to be disturbed now, Rexy. Put Charlie on a clad and leash for the day, I want to see to him. Yes, sir. Well, darling, I'm afraid the European trip's off. But you were so certain only yesterday that nothing could keep you from going. I know it, but... Darling, I'm in trouble. The worst trouble I've ever been in in my whole life. Why, what is it, George? I'm threatened with disbarment. How perfectly awful. No, I don't think I'll go out to lunch today. Yeah, I know, but I think I'd better give my stomach a rest. Oh, I'll just send out for a chocolate malted or something. Wait a minute. Hello? Yes, Miss Gordon, I'll tell him just as soon as he comes in. I'm on my way to the Surrogate's Court and lunch. - Did you hear what I said, Greta Garbo? - Yeah, I heard you, I heard you, go ahead. I can hardly bear to tear myself away from you. - Here's a little present for you. - Say, quit it, will you, huh? Aw, just a fresh mug in the office here, putting things down my back. Yeah, I know, they never can keep their hands to themselves. Why, darling, I never would have had a night's sleep... ...if I'd let that boy go up the river for life. Of course I'm perfectly willing to accept your explanation, but... frankly there's something extremely distasteful to me... ...about the atmosphere of the whole thing. This association with thieves and perjurors, and now this scandal. There will be a scandal, I'm sure. I'll try and spare you all I can, darling. How am I going to face my friends, what are they going to say? - Do they mean more to you than I do? - Oh, that isn't the point. It's something deeply vital to you. Your career, your reputation... ...and all the rest of it. But what am I to do? Flutter about pathetically in the background... ...in an atmosphere of scandal and recrimination? No. No, I can't. The best thing for me to do is to go to Europe as I planned. If this thing blows over, and let's hope it will, you can join me abroad later. You mean you're going to walk out on me? That's very unfair of you, George. That implies I'm deserting you when you need me and you know that isn't so. Well... it was just at a time like this that I thought I'd... ...like to have you around, that's all. Well, isn't that a little bit selfish, George? I assure you that if I could see how giving up my trip... ...could possibly help you out of your difficulty, I'd do it in a minute. But... but you know it couldn't. Yes, sure, forget about it, darling, it was just a foolish idea of mine, you're perfectly right. I'll have to fight this thing out by myself. Well, if you think of any way in which I can be helpful... I'll let you know, thanks, darling. Well, I really must run now. Dorothy and I are due at the hairdresser's at two. Au revoir, George. And I do hope everything's going to be all right. We'll see. Good bye, darling. Well, the first thing you know it all ended up in a terrible fight. Wait a minute, Gracie. Say, Charlie, Mr. Simon wants you right away. Hello, Gracie. Yeah, that's the whole trouble. As soon as he gets a couple of drinks in him, he gets nasty. Come in. Excuse me, chief. Bessie says you was asking for me. Yeah... Say, listen, Charlie. Come on, come in. Listen. There's a lawyer by the name of Francis Clark Baird. Sure, I know him. Well, I want you to see what you can find out about him. You want him shadowed, is that it? I want to know just how he spends his time, who his friends are... ...and where he goes nights. - I get you, chief. - All right, get right on the job, Charlie. Spend whatever's necessary and keep it under your hat. Leave it to me, chief, mum's the word. - Shine'em up, boss? - Not now, Joe. - After lunch? - Oh, wait a minute, come on in. - You might as well do it now. - Sure, boss. Do you want to see Mrs. Becker and her son now? Are they still here? Tell them to come back tomorrow. They've been waiting a long time. All right, I'll see them. Oh, wait a minute! Just have the boy come in. I can talk to him better if he hasn't got his mother here to sympathize with him. Hey, boss, I hear you're going to take a nice little trip. Yeah, sure. And you're going to take the missus along too, huh? Oh, I guess... Come on, Joe, make it snappy, will you? Yes, boss. Sit down, Becker. And listen to what I got to say. Hm, they did beat you up, didn't they? - Are you badly hurt? - I'm alright. Well, maybe this will be a lesson to you. The only reason I'm helping you is not because I have any sympathy for you, I think you're just a silly kid. But I've known your mother ever since you were wearing diapers. She's a good, honest, hard-working woman, that's why I'm doing this, understand? Well, what's the matter, can't you talk? - You can talk plenty in Union Square. - I can talk when there's need to talk. I'm glad to hear it. Now listen. I spoke with the assistant district attorney. He's agreed to accept a plea of guilty... ...and ask the court to give you a suspended sentence. That means you're all right as long as you keep your mouth shut. I won't plead guilty and I won't keep my mouth shut! Oh, you won't, won't you? As long as I'm representing you, you'll be guided by my advice, understand? I never asked you to represent me. That's a fine way to talk to me, isn't it? You know that I put up bail for you out of my own pocket? Oh, I care. Keep your charity for your parasites. Here, what the... Come on, Joe, get out of here. Good bye, boss. All right, now that you haven't got an audience, let's cut off the soap-box stuff, I know just how you feel about it. I'm used to making grandstand plays for my juries myself. Now, you gotta promise me to keep quiet with this communistic talk. Listen, Simon, you can't make me keep quiet. If the cossacks wanna beat me up, let them do it. What do you mean cossacks, this is America, not Russia. It's worse than Russia ever was under the czar. What do you know about Russia under the czar, were you ever there? - I was born in a steerage. - Yeah? Well, you got better meals coming over than I did. You know what's the matter with you, you're very young... ...and you got a lot of crazy ideas. Now, I'm gonna give you some good, practical advice. I don't want your advice, your help, or your friendship. You and I have nothing in common. I'm on one side of the class war and you're on the other. Oh, stop talking like an idiot. Do you think I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth? I began life in the same gutter that you did. Why, you wouldn't have the guts to go through one tenth... ...of what I went through to get where I am. You and your cossacks and your class wars. Do you think I don't know what it means to sweat and freeze and go hungry? Don't come around me with any of that half-baked communistic bull... ...and expect me to fall for it. Oh, shut up, Simon! How did you get where you are? I'll tell you. By betraying your own class, that's how. By climbing on the backs of the working class, that's how. Getting in right with bourgeois politicians... ...and crooked corporations that feed on the blood and the sweat of the workers! - That's enough! - No, it's not enough! I'm going to tell you what you are, Counsellor Simon, sitting here in your Fifth Avenue office with a bootblack at your feet... ...and a lot of white-collar slaves running your errands for you. You're a renegade and a cheap prostitute, that's what you are! You and your cars, and your country estate, and your kept power aside of a wife! - Shut up! - No, I won't shut up! I'll say it again! Your kept power aside of a wife and her two pampered brats! - That's enough! - Go on, hit me! Beat me up. I'm used to it. I like it. I'd like to be beaten up by comrade Simon of the working class, who sits rolling in wealth and luxury while millions of us brothers starve! You dirty traitor, you! - Mr. Simon. - Yeah? It's time to leave. Your luncheon appointment with Senator Wells. Oh... yeah. Time to leave. Excuse me, Mr. Simon. - What is it? - Is there anything wrong? Of course not, why should there be anything wrong? Because if there were anything I could do. You can mind your own business, that's what you could do. Simon and Tedesco. Who's calling, please? Oh, yes, Mrs. Simon. No, ma'am, he hasn't come back from Washington yet, I'll connect you with Miss Gordon. Mrs. Simon calling Miss Gordon. Alrighty, go ahead. Bessie, is Mr. Simon busy? He's been out of town, Charlie, but Miss Gordon's expecting him soon. - Well, let me know the minute he gets here. - Okay. Well, he may have gone right from Pennsylvania Station to the pier. No, I haven't heard from him all day, but I know he's planning to see you off. How soon will you be at the pier, Mrs. Simon? And you sail at six. All right, I'll tell him. Good bye. Oh, I hope you have a pleasant trip. I hope you fall overboard. Come in. Simon and Tedesco. Mr. Simon is out of town. I don't know, but do you want to talk to Miss Gordon? Alrighty, go ahead. Hello? Hello, one moment, please. ??? May be reached Monday. Hello, George. Run along, Goldie, I'll give you the rest later. Well? Well, Pete Malone and I just got back from Washington. - Did you see his nibs? - Sure, we saw him. He's not going to do anything about it, John. He's not? Yellow mutt. Did you tell him if it hadn't been for you, he wouldn't be where he is today? Don't you know whenever you give anybody a helping hand, he always turns around and kicks you in the pants? Yeah? Oh, just a minute. Rexy wants to talk to you, George. Yeah? Oh... She's on her way to the steamer, but I don't think... ... she'll be there for a half hour yet. Have a taxi ready for me in about 15 minutes. Oh, did you arrange about the books and flowers? Fresh flowers every day, did they understand that? Yeah, that's all. - No, John, there's not a chance... - You're not licked yet, George. - You've got to... - I don't believe in kidding myself. Between us we've done we've tried everything that could be tried. And now I'm licked, I'm finished, through, kaput. I'm about ready to quit anyway. Why shouldn't I? Why shouldn't I thumb my nose at the whole lot of them and walk right out of here? - You're crazy! - Why am I crazy? Let them disbar me, what do I care? I'll spend the rest of my life enjoying myself. - You'd be sick of it in a year. - Why would I? The world's a big place. When I get tired of sightseeing, I could settle down somewhere. Get out in the sun a lot. I could take up golf maybe. Probably be the best thing in the... Aw, you're right, John, a year? I'd go nuts in six months. Forget all about that, will you, George? What am I going to do, John? How am I going to spend the rest of my life? I'm no golf player, and I don't know an ace from a king. I don't even know how to get drunk. All I know is work. Take work away from me and what am I, a... ...a car without a motor. A living corpse. Now listen, take my advice and get some sleep tonight. Why don't you lie down and take a nap now? No, I gotta go down to the boat say good bye to Cora. It's pretty hard on her, John. A woman with her background married to a lawyer... ...who gets himself kicked out of his profession. - George. - What? I know, old man, thanks. - Who is calling, please? - Good afternoon. - Mr. Weinberg, Surrogate Court calling you. - All right, I'll take it in the library. One moment, please, I'll connect you with Mr. Weinberg. - Time for me to leave? - No, you still have a few minutes. - Do you want to go over your mail? - No, let it wait. Yes? Charlie McFadden wants to see you about something. - I don't want to see him now. - Not now, Bessie. Alrighty. No, Charlie, you can't see him now. - But I got to see him. - I'm just telling you what Miss Gordon said. But, I... Mr. Fisherman called up and said he sold your Golf Coast Utilities at 28 and a quarter. Twenty-eight and a quarter? That's 12 points profit. Tell Mr. Tedesco he's made $10,000. Anything else? No, I put off everything else. - Oh, Mr. Simon. - Well? I called up the Bellevue Hospital to inquire about that young communist, Harry Becker. Oh, how's he getting along? He died early this morning of a cerebral hemorrhage. - He died? - It's awful, isn't it? That's terrible. Listen, Rexy, I'll tell you what I want you to do. Arrange to have me pay for the funeral. Oh, and send his mother a check for $500. What do you know about that? Dead. A young boy like that. Well, maybe he's better off. In his own eyes he died a hero and a martyr to a cause. That's better than living to be old and ending your days in disgrace. - What are you crying about. - Nothing. - He's better off where he is. - I'm not crying about him. What are you crying about? - What's the matter with you lately? - There's nothing the matter with me. - Don't you feel well? - Yes, of course I do. Perhaps you've been working to hard. Maybe you need a little vacation. - No, no, I don't need a vacation. - I'll be going away soon myself. You got a good, long rest. I don't want to rest. I'll get a cab for you now. Wait a minute. Hello? Alrighty. Hello, doorman, hold a cab for Mr. Simon. Say, that was nothing. Can you imagine what happened to me the other day? Well, I was on the way to the office, see, and a man jumped out... ...of about the 12th-story window almost right in front of my eyes. Yeah. Mr. Bellini, please, Mr. Tedesco calling. Mr. Bellini? One moment, please, Mr. Tedesco calling. Mr. Bellini, Mr. Tedesco, alrighty, go ahead. Now, Charlie... Excuse me, chief, can I see you for a minute? - Not now, I told you. - I've got some news for you. - What kind of news. - About our friend down the street. - What do you mean, Baird? - That's him. - Found out something about him? - I'll say I have. - What is it, Charlie, what is it? - He's leading a double life. What do you mean he's leading a double life? Wait till I tell you, chief. You remember me telling you the other day... how I found out he was always making business trips to Philadelphia... - Well? - Yesterday, off he goes... ...to Pennsylvania Station and boards a train for Philly with me right behind him. But he gets out there at the station, he hops a taxi, I hears him tell the driver Germantown. So I grabs another hack and tells the driver to follow him. Well, we're going along great. But all of a sudden we get into a traffic jam... ...and by the time they get it straightened out, we loses him. - Is that all? - My, no, that's just the beginning. - Well, go ahead, go ahead. - Well, I goes back to the station, hangs around, waiting to see when the other cab's going to come back again. After waiting about three hours, sure enough, back it comes. - Was Baird in it? - No, sir, he wasn't. Well, go on! Well, I gets talking to the driver of the cab, I asks him if he remembers taking a party out to Germantown, he says he does and he thinks the address was Sycamore Drive. - But he can't remember the number. - Well? - Excuse me, Mr. Simon, the taxi is waiting. - Tell him to wait. Go ahead, Charlie. Well, he takes me off to Sycamore Drive, but he can't remember just which house it is. So I starts getting acquainted and asking a few questions around. It's kind of a quiet family neighborhood... with mostly one- or two-family hou... What did you find out, Charlie, what did you find out? Well, I asked them if there was any gentleman came around calling... ...answering to the description of our friend Mr. Baird. Why, yes, says a fellow that runs a little cigar store there. That sounds like the uncle of little Mrs. Allen over at 1217. She's a poor little widow woman, and all the kindred kin she has in the whole world... is an old uncle from Pittsburgh that comes to see her... - Pittsburgh? - According to this fellow. Go ahead, go ahead. So I strolls over to 1217, and it's dark by now. And I looks into the window. And there sits the little widow sitting having supper with a kid. A pretty little youngtser he is, too. - Was Baird there? - No, sir, he wasn't. Well, what the... - What is all this? - Wait a minute, chief. - I ain't done yet. - Go on, go on! So I says to meself, that little lady don't look like no niece to me. And as for the kid, he's the spitting image of old man Baird. Do you call that evidence? No, sir. - Go on, Charlie. - Well, I hangs around. But there's nothing to be done until everybody's in bed. So I goes away and I has a feeling. And I takes in a movie. And along about 2 o'clock in the morning, I go back to 1217 and take a look inside the house. What do you mean, you broke into the house? - I wouldn't want to admit that, chief. - What did you do a thing like that for? Don't worry about it, chief, it was an easy job. I ain't as much out of practice as I thought I'd be. Well, what did you find out? Well, I figured there'd be letters from him. And there was. You mean... You mean you found letters from Baird to this woman? Yes, sir, a whole stack of them. - Where are they, what did they say? - They're right here. And they're all about how much he loves her, and about how she don't have to worry about her future. ...or the kid's future if you just keep mum. Holy... Why, this is a clear admission of the paternity of the child! And his... his picture and the kid's picture taken together. It was in a frame on her dresser. I didn't think you'd want the frame. It was sort of a big fancy leather... Young Frankie! So that's what the old bird's been up to, eh? - Is that what you wanted, chief? - Sure, this is worth a million dollars to me! Only you were a darn fool to go break into that house. Oh, it was the least I could do for you, chief, after all you've done for me. Young Frankie! So that's how the Pilgrim Fathers signed their love letters! Mr. Simon, you really should go now. No, I can't go now. Get me Francis Clark Baird on the phone right away. If you don't need me now, chief, I'll be going on home. I didn't get much sleep last night. All right, Charlie, go ahead. Come in and see me in the morning. - What was that address, Sycamore Drive? - 1217. - Keep it under your hat. - Oh, I've given my word. Mr. Baird is busy and can't be disturbed. - Is that his secretary? - Yes, sir. Hold her there, I want to talk to her. Hello. Mr. Baird's secretary? This Mr. Simon speaking, Mr. George Simon. Mr. Baird's busy, he can't be disturbed? I see. Well, will you take a message for him, please? Thanks. Tell him a client of mine is very much interested... ...in the property at 1217 Sycamore Drive, Germantown. No, Germantown. Yes, Germantown, Pennsylvania, yes, that's right. I'll be here for half an hour if he wants to call back, thank you! Rexy, if he calls up, put him right on. John! Come right in, I got some hot news! But Mrs. Simon's boat sails at six... Listen, Rexy, call up the French Line pier and tell them to connect you with the steamer. Get a hold of Mrs. Simon and tell her... Forget all about that. Take this note. "Darling, don't sail." I may be able to sail with you myself in three or four days. Phone me the instant you get this and have your luggage taken off the boat. Hastily, and happily" Get that right out and send it by a messenger in a taxi cab. Wait a minute! Get Charlie McFadden to take it. He can help Mrs. Simon off the boat and with her luggage. Your Frankie! John! I got him, I got him just where I want him, the old son of a... Look at that! Look at Papa! Come in. Was you asking for me, Miss Gordon? Yes. Yes, take this down to the French Line pier, give this to Mrs. Simon personally and help her off the boat with her baggage. - You don't have a minute to spare. - Oh, don't worry yourself about me, - I'll make it to the boat. - All right. Simon and Tedesco. For Mr. Weinberg... right... I'd like to see Mr. Simon, please. Look at this... Look at this one. - Excuse me, Mr. Baird, Mr. Simon. - Oh, I'll talk to him... No, he's outside. What do you mean, he's there in the office? Yes, sir. Hello? Alrighty. Mr. Simon's busy just now, Mr. Baird, but if you'd care to sit down and wait, he'll see you in just a little while. Well, is he likely to be busy long? He didn't say, but I don't think he'll be long. Well, I'll wait. I'm going for the day. - Good night. - Good night, Goldie. Hello, Henry? Say, listen, Henry, will you take the board like a nice boy? I've got some shopping to do before the stores close. Aw, come on, I'll do something nice for you some day. Thanks, Henry, you're a nice kid. - Oh, how do you do, Mr. Baird? - How do you do? I guess you don't remember me, I'm Mr. Simon's partner, John Tedesco. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Tell me, do you think Mr. Simon will be free soon? Why, I really couldn't say. Does he know you're here? Yes, he does. That is, I assume he does. - Oh, yes he does, Mr. Tedesco. - Oh, he does? Well, then I'm sure he'll see you soon. Well, glad to have seen you again, Mr. Baird, good bye. Oh, Henry, come ahead, will you, I gotta go! Yes, what about me, when do I get home? Oh, they'll all be going home in a few minutes. Oh, there's some chocolate there if you want to. I don't want no chocolate. Mr. Baird, Mr. Simon will see you now. - Thank you. - It's the first door to the right. Thank you! Come in. Henry, when Mrs. Simon calls, put her on my wire. - Yes, ma'am. - Miss Gordon. - Are you going up on the el tonight? - No, I'm not. Well... good night. - Going for the day, Mr. Weinberg? - Yes. Good night. - Wait a minute, Cleopatra. - I can't, I'm in a hurry. Well, can't my chauffeur drop you somewhere? Say, quit it, will ya? Can't you keep your hands to yourself? Good night, Oswald. Oh, if Peggy Joyce calls me, I can be reached in my box at the opera. - Good evening, Mrs. Simon. - Good evening, is my son still here? I think there's somebody in there with him. Oh, that's alright, I can wait, I got plenty time. - But I'll tell Miss Gordon you're here. - All right. Hello, Miss Gordon, Mr. Simon's mother is here. - Thank you. - Are you going to be a lawyer too? - Oh, I don't know. - My son began just like you. When he was 13 years old he was office boy for $4 a week. Four dollars? Gee, I started with 12 and I'm getting 15 now. Yes, $4 he started with, and today he's the biggest lawyer in New York. - Hello, Mrs. Simon. - Hello, Miss Gordon. I can't disturb Mr. Simon now, but I don't think he'll be very long. That's alright. Miss Gordon, he's feeling alright, is he? Yes, as far as I know. Over the telephone he sounded so blue, I was worried about him. Well, if there's anything wrong, he hasn't told me. After you, Mr. Baird. - Thank you. - Not at all. Hello, Mama, what are you doing here? Oh, Mr. Baird, I want you to meet my mother. How do you do, Mrs. Simon? She's a regular old shrew, Mr. Baird, if I don't behave myself, she comes after me with a rolling pin. Now, Georgie, how can you talk such foolishness? - Will you pardon me, I really must be going. - All right, Mr. Baird, thanks for coming. Why don't you drop in some time and have lunch with me? - Thank you, good day, Mrs. Simon. - Good bye. Good day. There's my pal. Francis Clark Baird! One of the finest, handsomest, blueblooded... - ...stuffed-shirts I ever met in my life. - What's the matter with you, Georgie? I'm just feeling good, Mama, I never felt so good in my life! How about a little dance. Come on, lady, give me a dance. Now, Georgie, Georgie, are you verklempt? - Fine dancer you are. - Geo... Go on, kid, I don't want you anymore. But you're expecting a call from Mrs. Simon. That's all right, I'll take the call myself. Go on, beat it. - Yes, sir. - And here! - Blow yourself to the ballgame Sunday. - Gee, thanks, Mr. Simon. - Good night, Mr. Simon. - Good night. Go on home. - Oh, I'm in no hurry. - Go on home, I said! - Oh, good night, Mrs. Simon. - Good night, Miss Gordon. - Georgie, why do you act crazy? - I just feel good, I tell... - Can't I feel good if I want to? - Yes, I'm, glad you're feeling good, but... Gee, that's a swell hat, is that a new hat? Yes, of course, two years ago it was new. I never saw... Wait a minute! That must be Cora now. Hello. Hello, darling. Listen, darling, I've got some wonderful news. You know, the Baird matter, it's over and fixed up. I knew you would be. You're off the boat all right? You only got ten minutes? Didn't you get my note? I know, I told you I could sail with you in three or four days. I know, but you can get off the boat in time. We'll have a little celebration tonight, just the two of us.. What do you mean, you don't want to? Oh, I see. Oh, sure, I wouldn't want you to do anything unreasonable. No, it's all right. No, no, it's all right. Well... have a wonderful trip. Good bye. - Georgie... - What is it, Mama, what do you want? - Something is wrong, Georgie, tell me. - I told you, there's nothing wrong! - Maybe I can help you. - You can help me by going home, that's how you can help. Alright. If you want me to go, I'll go. Good bye, Georgie. And please, take care of yourself. Good bye, Mama, stop worrying about me, will you, I'm all right. What are you doing here, I told you to go home. I just wanted to make sure there was nothing else you wanted. No, there isn't. I want you to go home. Yes, sir. Good night. Good night. Hello, 9246? I want to speak to Mr. Roy Darwin, please. Oh, is that so? When did he sail? At six o'clock this evening, you mean? I see... Hello, just a minute. Do you happen to know what boat he's sailing on? Thank you. Oh, hello, George. Well, is everything all right? What's the matter? I thought everybody had gone. Sure, everything's all right. Well, I'm happy about it. You must be like a new man. Yeah, I do. I feel fine. Well, I'm sure glad it's all over. Did you get Cora? - No, I couldn't get her. - Then she sailed. That's too bad. - Yeah, she sailed, I couldn't get her. - Well, you can send her a radiogram. That's what I'm going to do, send her a radiogram. You look all in, George. Come on, let me take you home. No... thanks old man, I got a couple of things to do before I leave. - Well, I'll see you in the morning. - Yeah. - Good night. - Good night. What do you want? Didn't I tell you to go home? You've been spying on me, that's what you've been doing! - I have not... - Stop lying, what do you mean by spying on me? I met Mr. Tedesco in the hall, he said you were still here, I was so worried. - Oh, my God! - Oh, shut up! Get out or I'll break your g... Answer that thing. Can't you even answer that phone? Hello? Yes. Yes, I'll see if he's still here. Who's calling, please? It's Mr. Theodore Wingdale, the president of the American Steel Company. Tell him to go to the devil. Shall I say you're not in? I... I don't care what you say. I'm afraid he's gone, Mr. Wingdale. Well, just a moment. He says it's a matter of life and death. Oh, tell him... - Is that Wingdale himself? - Yes, sir. Well, tell him... Oh... I'll talk to him myself. Hello, Mr. Wingdale? George Simon speaking. Yes, she just got me as I was walking in the elevator. What's the trouble? Huh? Is that so? Yes. Have the police been there? Don't make any statement and don't let the boy do any talking either. I'll be up there in about an hour... Wait a minute. Wait till I get that address. Turn on the lights, Rexy. All right, go ahead, Mr. Wingdale. Positive? Yeah... I got it. I'll be up there before eight. Oh, wait a minute! You haven't consulted any other lawyer about this, have you? All right. Don't mention it. Good bye. That was Wingdale! President of the American Steel Company. His son had a quarrel with his wife this afternoon and shot her dead! Can you imagine what a case that's gonna be? It's gonna knock... Come on! We gotta get on the job. Are you ready? - Yes, sir! - We'll grab a sandwich on the way up now! Hey, wait a minute, going down! I forgot my hat... Never mind. Come on, listen! As soon as we get to the house this is what you got to remember... - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
