Hello. Bye bye. I love my job. The sounds of machines comfort me. Every time it spins, it washes and gets cleaner. Every time it lifts, it folds and tidies the laundry we deliver. It's the sound of things getting better. It's the sound of progress. But progress is not a straight line. I've learnt that you need to take into account wind resistance, trajectory over distance, the weight of your arrow. Like my mother always says, "Always aim slightly off-center" Hello. How can you simply approve all these claims? We can't make everyone who complains happy. I know it's your last day but you still need to apply the bell curve. Passion Card? No Passion. Then no discount. Clementi... three-room flat. Well-ventilated and faces the sea. Tampines? It's not bad but it's far from the city center That's right. I hear people say the en bloc sale will most likely go through. That's why we have to plan ahead. Where are you moving to? Hey, that's not too bad. Aiyoh! Ma. Go, go, go. No, it's my son. All right, I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Eat, Ma. - Eat. You know that uncle next door? Last night he was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Auntie said he fell down when he went to the toilet, but she only found out about it in the morning. - Is he okay? - He's okay, lah. But he's still in the Intensive Care Unit. - Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday to me. - Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday to me. - Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday to me. - Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday to me. - For you. - Thank you. Police are dumbfounded by the latest string of robberies. Two male suspects wearing nothing but swimming trunks and a balaclava, have struck yet again. This time around, they have targeted the antiques and paintings from homes in the Pearl Bank area. Investigators are appealing to local residents, who may recognize.. Have you packed? Orh. This is a great opportunity. You should seize it. They offer a high salary and good benefits. They even cover food and accommodation. You're already thirty. You should put your career first and plan for the future. I wish you a happy birthday. I hope you will find your happiness. Thank you for bringing me up. Thank you for your beautiful flowers. But they are so expensive. There's no need to buy them every year. Cake is expensive too. It's been 30 years. Now I am free! The revolution of neighborhood living is here.

According to your happiness ring, your happiness level is 50%. That's pretty good. Like my mother always said, "Glass half full." I'm so happy we have something to work on together. Speaking of work, allow me to introduce Ms. Wee, your assigned senior client. What are you waiting for? Take a look. Her happiness is key to your promotion. Any questions? Detecting no questions. Yes, why don't you try out your new uniform? It is a good day to try a new perspective. Let's put unity back into the community. The cat is missing. Go find it. Meow. Meow. Bob, cancer. Mimi, heart attack. Lucy, car accident. All dead. Time's up. Shut the door! How was your first day at work, Bee? I wish my mother let me keep pets. Ms. Wee really likes her cats, right? Speaking of mothers, detecting a deep poetic longing of familial ties. Would you like me to call your mother? Hello? - Ma. - Bee? What are you doing? I'm watching TV. How are you? Was it fun? Have you made new friends? It's all right. Happiness Level 55%. Who's that? Nobody. I can tell from your voice that something has happened. You're just like that. Ever since you were young, you would always get bullied. I remember when you were ten, you had a good friend. He saw that you had a new toy, but he didn't have one. So he broke your new toy. You smiled and you told me, "Don't worry about it." "As long as it makes them happy, I'm okay." No matter what happened, you were always smiling. You smiled when you fell down. You smiled when Mama scolded you. Other kids would cry. But you? You love to smile. Have you eaten? Not yet. Go and eat then. Work hard. You can do this. Bye bye. Bye bye. You miss her, don't you? I know how you feel. Since you have your cake, why don't you eat it? Your happiness level is now 45%. Happiness level 44%. Happiness level 43%. Hey, look on the bright side. Glass 43% full. Happy thoughts, Bee! Data says nothing takes the blues away like a little waltz. Shall we dance? Laughter not only boosts blood circulation but also helps you to exercise all other muscles. Let's now conclude the exercise. Very good, very good. Yay! Thank you, Geok. That was wonderful. Come, sit down, sit down. We had a great week behind us. Our Gross Community Happiness Index reached... Sixty-five percent! Yay! We still have room for improvement, but we will get there. We will get there. We will get there. We will get there. We will get there! We will get there! Let's give a round of applause to our high achievers. Orked. Water Confidence, 85 points. Roshan. Communal Kitchen, 90 points. Geok... Mindfulness Rejoice. Ninety-five points! All right, all right. That's all we have for today. The rest of the day is spent in workshops. So please go ahead and choose what interests you. - Having fun? - Yeah. I'm Orked. Like Vanda Miss Joaquim. - You the new guy? - Bee. Five, six, seven, eight. Up, clap. Down, down, up. And spin, two, three, four... clap. Very nice! Pat yourself on the fin, everyone. Good job. Pat your friend on the fin. You're going back into the womb. This is your happiest place. Nice! Wonderful! Oh, okay. Come here, little fishy. Okay... Wonderful job! Yes, pat him on the fin. Pat each other on the fin. Okay, ready again? Very good, very good. Yay! All right, we're gonna take a five-minute break. So I'll see you back in the water, yeah? Come, come. You are very good. Slowly... Ah Bee! You'll make a good fish! That's Uncle Mok, my assigned senior client. He comes here for every class but he just sits by the side, never gets in the water. Cute, huh? How's the progress with your senior client? So, you like fish balls? The previous Happiness Agent choked on one. They had to send him to the hospital. Poor thing. You smile a lot, but are you happy? Do you all really care about our happiness? We are cheapskates. We only joined for the freebies. Do you want to see some magic? Blow. Harder. Not everything can be seen with the naked eye. You've got to feel it. Blow. Harder! Give it to me. Let's go. Hurry up. Don't worry. This is a Tiong Bahru cat. If the en bloc sale goes through, we will get a lot of money. What you will do with it? I have nothing to buy, so I'll just leave it in the bank. But the bank interest is very low! You seem very sure that the en bloc sale will go through. I'm sure it will happen. Remember, unity is power. It was good living here. Could you leave it behind? These are our collective memories, our cultural heritage. We should preserve these. What good are memories? We want money! Which unit are you in? Please hear me out. Don't you want to leave something for future generations? - Do you know what we want? - We only want the money! Hey boy, which unit are you in? I live at 40-08. Hello, there are only 38 stories. I misspoke. - It's 38-08. - That's his place. - Number 36-07. - That's my unit! So, you live here? I would love to. Whack him! Number 03-08! Number 05-06! Number 13-29! Number 27-58! Number 13-18! Welcome to our little cuddle oasis. I'm Haniff and I will be your guide today. Today, we will learn about the happiness that... Today, we will learn about the happiness that a simple touch can bring. Ah Bee, do you mind? Let's give it up for Ah Bee, everyone. There are three basic types of hugs and they all release varying degrees of oxytocin. Oxytocin. Yes. Now, the first hug that I will show you... I call this hug "the turtle." Imagine yourself as the shell, protecting the soft and vulnerable turtle. This next hug is called "the snake." Because you're just like a snake that had a very large meal. This is a spider on its back How does it feel, Ah Bee? It feels wonderful. Give it up for Ah Bee, everyone. Very good, Ah Bee. Very good. Now... let's find your partners. And when you're ready, we will start. Oh, it's you again. You are mine. Please get into position. Let's talk about your deepest fears and traumas. I'm afraid of being afraid of being alone. I'm fine being alone but... I'm afraid that I'll be afraid to be alone. You know what I mean? Great fears, everyone. Keep up the good work. Thank you for the lovely hug. Wonderful. Now, everybody, let's get into a big pile of cuddle. Come on. Come on, everyone. Come in tighter, tighter. Yes, that's it. Very good, very good. Lovely. A puddle of cuddle. Thank you. Let me start with our newest recruit, Ah Bee. And this is Geok. She's our top performer. What can we do to make her happier? I'll think of something. I know you will. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And shoulders, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And reach, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. All right. Very good, very good. Yay! Are we ready to take the leap? Yay! Beautiful! Right, it's your turn now. Slowly, one step at a time, okay? Remember to be brave. Be brave. Now, to your right, and left. And right, and left, and turn... Yay! Remember your breathing and, of course, your fishy sounds. Ms. Wee, hello! You look so pretty. Are you sure you don't want to go in the water? I am a cat. Cats hate water. Is Ms. Wee afraid of water? You need to face your fears to overcome them, okay? Meow, meow, meow! Nothing scares me. You know nothing about me. Don't pretend to be smart, thinking that you know more about life than we do. Get a real job. One where you can wear something decent. All right, guys. Break's over. Let's just go into our lines and then we'll do everything from the top, okay? You remember, yes? You have to be nice to people. I don't. I don't have to be nice to you, and I don't have to be nice to that girl. How can a fish change the world? Nah. No surprises on the Happiness Contribution Leaderboard. Great job again, Geok! Good work, good work! Now, for the weekend's party, it is a recognition of all the positive efforts of everyone's work in meeting our KPls. And it is also a special celebration to formalize a beautiful match in our neighborhood So don't forget to invite all your senior clients to the party as well. - Yes? - Yes! As there are celebrations, there are also goodbyes. Unfortunately, those who are not contributing will have to make room for more enthusiastic new members. Boon! We're very happy to wish you good luck in your future endeavors outside of the community. - Huh? - Your cat tours are not working out. So please proceed to the reception. Remember, farewells are fresh beginnings. Hit it. Bye bye, Boon Bye bye Pack your bags and leave this place Bye bye Don't look back... I feel bad about Boon. Me too. Are you scared you might be next? Ms. Wee is a difficult client, huh? She's rude but she speaks her mind. And she has a point. I mean, who am I to talk about facing your fears? All I do is regurgitate these self-help mantras. Anyone can do it. Don't worry. You'll be fine. Have you tried whale sound meditation? Can I see his data? I'll get it. Ninety-two, 93, 94… Wow, Bee! If only your happiness score went up like this. But you know, there is a scientific link between heart rate and happiness. Is everything okay, Bee? Are you sure? Detecting dolphins in your thoughts. The happiness ring signals are a bit weak under the bed. Come, let us not mess with the algorithm. Nothing like a bit of fresh air to clear the cache. The revolution of neighborhood living is here. Because at Tiong Bahru Social Club, everyone's happiness is our business. Tiong Bahru Social Club is a true modern-day kampong experience. As a senior client, you have access to Happiness Workshops, Pioneer Rewards and a personal Happiness Agent. Our ever-learning data algorithm ensures higher returns on your property investment through increased communal happiness. Plan for your golden years and beyond. Sign up now! I love Haniff's puddle of cuddle. It's so fun! Our property valuation has doubled. Sure-win investment. I feel happy and free living here. You are such an obedient boy. You do exactly as you are told. Don't you have a mind of your own? You don't have to care what other people think. - Meow. - Do what you like. Look at Ah Leng and Ah Hock. Even at their age, they have managed to find love. It's so nice. Auntie Leng. Uncle Hock. We are gathered here to witness a day of true happiness and a future of joy. Tiong Bahru Social Club is just so happy to play a little part in this beautiful match, made by our data. Auntie Leng. Uncle Hock. We wish you all the best. Very good, very good. Yay! Congratulations to you both. Come, let's celebrate! You danced so well. You too. Go get us some alcohol. It's so warm tonight. Indeed. It's so hot. So hot I want a shower. It's such a windless night. Cheers. - The facilities are just so nice. - Oh, yes. And we are always recruiting new Happiness Agents. - So nobody has to be home alone. - Yes. We are playing a game. We are playing "Shoot, Shag, Marry." Do you want to play? Do you wanna go... Oh! Ah Bee! Come, come, come. You're right on time. We're playing a game. We're playing "Shoot, Shag, Marry." Do you know how to play? So, it's like, who do you wanna shoot, who do you wanna shag and who you want to marry? Okay, you go. Marry Geok. Shoot Vicki. Shag Orked. You're supposed to list people who are not here. - Why would you shoot Vicki? - Yeah... The modern society presents us with too many options. But they are all an illusion. My decision is always not to make any decisions. Who we shoot, shag, and marry is actually a deeply private and philosophical question. Why would I tell anyone? It was time for her to go. She was not young anymore. You know, she really liked you. You made her happy. Happier than she had ever been before. Our data shows she died of happiness. She even mentioned you in her will. Ah Bee, you've been performing very well. Our analytics now know what you're good at. You'll be promoted to a new position very soon. And our AI has recognized an 83% match for you. Ms. Wee? It's you! According to quantum mechanics, a cat could be simultaneously alive and dead, as long as no one finds it. Meow. - Ma. - Bee? Don't you have to work? What's wrong? I have a girlfriend now. Really? I've been promoted too. Wonderful! But don't be arrogant. When can I meet your girlfriend? Next Sunday. Okay, those are your slippers. Oh. I didn't know you had a cat. - Me neither. - Oh, so sweet. Hi, darling. Hey! Hi, baby. How many children would you like to have? I want two. Nice. Are you happy? How do you know? The algorithm. Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams. Ah Bee, are you ready for your first day as a community service provider? Fantastic. Let me get you the details. This is a fabulous match for your profile. Don't forget the key! Thank you. Thanks for your support, BRAVO60. You're welcome. Now, let's go put unity back into the community. I hope this is everything you ever wanted. You found your place in the community. You have a beautiful apartment, a perfectly matched partner... and a job that gives you a purpose. I would say you're a winner. Tell me, BRAVO60. If I'm a winner, why don't I feel like I deserve it? Maybe it's all written in the stars, like an instruction manual. But when I look up, all I see is... one big emptiness. I want to complain! When I went back, the woman took my seat. She even used my tissue paper. Next time, I tell you, I will write my name on it. Your Daddy. Can I smoke here? How does it feel? Okay. Oh no. You were supposed to do that to me. Step Two: Sniff and Kiss. Okay. Well done, Ah Bee, Geok. That was good. They passed. Madam, the union is successful. We can accept Orked's resignation. I hate trains. I hate trains. I hate trains. It was so difficult finding this place. And when we arrived, the queue was so long. But there were no chairs. This is a basic matter. Why haven't you done this for us? If there is such a place, they only have avocado toast. That's what I wanted to say. The place is so expensive. Who would want to eat there? I wanna complain about my downstairs neighbor They are so noisy. Not noisy. Smelly! They eat durian. They eat durian every day. Is this the goddamn durian festival? Oh, yes! One more thing. Not enough yellow boxes. The queue is very long. Can you ask for more yellow boxes, please? It's so tough to smoke around here. I'm also an old man. We go to the park for morning exercise. Then we go to the hawker center for breakfast. But lately, I feel that the social climate is bad. The old folks have nothing to do. And so, they complain all day. Complain, complain. Complain, complain, complain. May I ask what they are queuing for? I saw them queue, so I followed suit. It must be something good. - I'll join you. - Please do. You're hugging me so tightly. Do you miss me that much? - How have you been? - Okay lah. Hello, Auntie Mui. Hi, I'm the manager, Haslinna. Ah Bee is number one at the Tiong Bahru Social Club. You must be so proud. Why don't you show your mother around? Mama. Mama. Mama... This is Geok. Hello, Auntie. Ah Bee often talks about you. Wow, you have such a beautiful room. - So many pillows. - Indeed. This light is special. It's alright. Please, have a seat, Auntie. Sit down, you two. We have a cat too. I cooked some noodles. Here, have some. Sorry to trouble you. I'll go get some chopsticks. Auntie. I don't need them. I can eat this whenever I want. - Try some. - I'm in for a treat today. So, I just start to complain? The uncles and aunties who used to greet me every day have been visiting me recently to discuss that en bloc sale. It's all about the money. They keep saying, "Sell your house. You really should sell your house." It's so scary. Aunty Meiling says, "The children will grow up and have their own families and homes." "You will be alone then. Why don't you stay with me?" Since Auntie Meiling has asked me, when the time comes, I will stay with Auntie Meiling. Lately, I've been watching a lot of TV shows. I watched this Japan travel program Wow! Japan is so beautiful. Auntie Meiling has promised to take me there if she wins the lottery. But I was thinking... why wait until we win the lottery? Even if we don't win the lottery, I could still go there on my own. I don't understand Japanese, but I can read their Chinese characters. I could also use body language. I just refuse to believe that I can't go to Japan on my own. Would you like me to go with you? You want to come? You can't speak Japanese either. It will be troublesome to bring you along. I'll go by myself. I feel that Geok is a nice girl. You should treasure this opportunity to stay. Ah Bee! I've been looking for you. I have something to tell you. My friend transferred his house to his son. But now, his son has kicked him out. It keeps me awake. I can't sleep. What if it happens to me? What do you think? Have we lost our Chinese values, like filial piety? I think my friend might end up in an old folks' home. Ah Bee! Any update on what we talked about? There are cigarette butts all over the corridor. If the children see it, they'll all start smoking. No one is listening. What are you going to do about this? Ah Bee! Meow. Complain! Complain! Complain! Complain! Complain! Complain! Complain! Complain! Complain! - Everyone. - Complain! Complain... I'm sorry. I lost my cat. I need to find it. Meow, meow, meow, meow. Meow, meow... Meow, meow. Meow. Meow. - Ah Bee. - Ah Bee? Did you miss me? Don't worry about me. I have lots of friends here. Mimi, Lulu, and my other sisters. I am so free and happy. Death feels so good. I wish I had died sooner. Are you happy? I am so happy now. Dead happy. Have you fed my cat? Have you ever wondered how shooting stars just glide across the sky, carrying the weight of all our wishes? Vacuum. Vacuum. Space in which there is no matter at all, or space in which the pressure is so low that any particles in the space cannot react with any of the matter. Emptiness. Nothingness. When you mold a bowl out of clay, it's the emptiness inside that makes the vessel useful. When you cut doors and windows into a building, it is the empty space inside that makes it livable. We work with what we see and we feel, but it's the emptiness we use. Maybe the glass should be empty. Ah Bee, are you sure? Your uncomplaining ways have given so many here a way to release their frustrations. A lot of people are going to miss you around here. They will be less happy. And you know, I just got an upgrade. I can do better. Bravo60? Yes, Ah Bee? Thank you for being my friend. Thank you, Ah Bee. I will miss you, my friend. We understand your decision to leave us to pursue your own goals. Thank you for staying with us and for doing such a tremendous job. Ah Bee, thank you. Ah Bee, we will all miss you. Complain! Complain! Complain! Complain! Goodbye, Tiong Bahru. Good luck and thank you. Ah Bee! Ah Bee! Ah Bee! Ah Bee! Ah Bee! Ah Bee! Ah Bee! Ah Bee! Ah Bee! Meow. What a headache. Where are you going? Please don't go, boss. Let's talk, okay? Are you for real? Seriously? You're actually leaving? What the hell? Ma? - Bee? - Hey... Why are you back? Huh? Ah Bee? Hi, dear. Hi. Some of your neighbors have moved out. Have you found a new place? Not Tampines? We could be neighbors again. I thought of what I can do to make a real difference. So I signed up for the SkillsFuture course. "Zen and the Art of TV Maintenance." What about you? Have you thought about your future? The revolution of neighborhood living is here. Because at Tiong Bahru Social Club, everyone's happiness is our business.
