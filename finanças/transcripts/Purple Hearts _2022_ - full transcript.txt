Oh, and please don't forget to tip your servers, 'cause, PS, we're also your servers. Great job! Oh my God, that was such a good set. - Bye, guys. That was awesome. - See you tomorrow. Look, Cassie, it's your faves. Hey! Hey, how's it going, buddy? Oh, great. Marines. Mild to medium harassment by nine, chaotic evil by ten. Hey, stranger! - Cass! - No. Frankie? - Cass? - Stop. - Hey! - Frankie! Surprise! - I missed you, you freak. - I missed you too, Salazar. Oh my God. Look at the buzz. No, I'm not okay with this at all. - Uh, Nora, Frankie. Frankie, Nora. - Nice to meet you. Nora, they're in The Loyal with me. Frankie, we grew up together, and I was his babysitter. Okay. Okay. - Don't say that in front of everybody. - Baby-faced Frankie. You see what you did? Cassie was just telling me how much she loves military boys. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. - Mmm. Uh, these are the guys. We've two weeks 'til we ship out to Iraq. - We're still in Iraq? - Not out yet. Another war that never ends. In that case, what you guys wanna drink? - First one's on the house. - Thank you. - Hey! - Tequila? - Does he look old enough to drink tequila? - Absolutely not. - Double that. - Copy that. - I'll have a Coke. - Mmm. Okay. - My kinda guy. - Hell, yeah. Could you throw in some lemon slices with that? How about you pace yourself, bro? Whoa! She's into you, bro. No. Okay? Just no. It's not gonna happen, never. Just let it go, cheekbones. - What? You two? - No, she's like an older sister to me. Uh, Cassie has a "no soldiers" policy, sorry. - We're marines. - What's that about? - Well, that means more of us for you then. - Oh. Tempting. Let me check with my girlfriend. Uh, three tequilas and a coke. So we're good enough to fight for your ass, but not enough to touch it? - Excuse me? - Okay. I'll excuse you, this time. I can't with this. - Real smooth. - What the hell? Come on. Bro. Let me see what I can do. Good luck, behave yourself. Don't do what he did. Dude has a perfect track record. Hey, I just wanted to apologize for our friend. He's a bit... Okay. Uh, I'm Luke, by the way. What's your name? Your waitress/bartender. Have a fun night, Luke. - You know, we're not all alike. - Oh, really? Yeah. Because your friend is talking about his right to touch my ass. Which apparently, you also feel entitled to. Okay, we're just blowing off some steam. It's, uh... It's actually a pretty big night. Last night on leave. We ship off in a few weeks. I get it, but, uh, not really an excuse for casual misogyny though. You're cute and everything, but... Okay, all right. I, uh... I get this. What do you get? You. Yeah. - Me? - Yeah, yeah. You're kind of predictable. I've... I've met your type before. Yeah. Oh. Do tell. Drive a Lexus that your parents paid for, but it's a hybrid, so it's okay. You... You probably tweet a lot about other people's rights, but when it comes down... Sorry, it's just fascinating to me. Do you have a PhD in mansplaining? When it actually comes down to fighting for these rights, you don't wanna do anything, right? 'Cause guns are mean. You're a pacifist. I guess it's our job to go off and fight those battles for you, right? I bet you have a little "peace-dove" tattoo on your back to prove it. On my ass, actually. Which you can't touch, but you can kiss. Nailed it. She's a pistol. Or they'll skip straight to chaotic evil. Come back. You see the guy that looks like he's 12 years old? He told me that I should reconsider my stance on men, because if I marry him, I would get incredible health insurance. Wow. Health insurance. - That's some dirty talk right there. - So hot. - Where's that coming from? - Mine. Made it annoying to not ignore it. Yes. Uh, hey, can you cover me for, like, five? - Yeah. You okay? - You know. Shit. Oh, it looks like I can't refill your prescription for another four days. Uh, okay. Uh... I... I can't really wait four days. Um... Look, I'm out of my long-acting and my short-acting insulin, and my reserve vial is basically gone, and it's just... it's really dangerous for me not to have this. I mean, I can give you a refill of your prescription if you wanna do it out of pocket. I don't think you understand... No, your insurance is not renewed, so I cannot refill it. So, if you wanna do it out of pocket, we can do that. And, um... how much is that? Three hundred for the long-acting, 220 for the short-acting. So, a little over $500. What do you wanna do? - Come on. - I'm so sorry. I'll be right with you. Ma, nothing. Check out in the other line. This line already hates me. Do you wanna step aside while... Can... you just give me a second? She speaks English too, thank you. Cassie! You take my cash. I'll do credit. - Ma! - Always health first. Gracias. Okay, that worked out. Do you wanna fill this, hon? Oh. That is... Shoot. Guess I'll try to make it to Friday without it. Thanks. Go Big Pharma. What the hell? Watch it! Shit. Hey, hey, hey! Get out of the way, "J." Yo! Those were some obstacle course moves right there, kid. Whoop! - What the hell, Johnno? - So is true, huh? I heard you joined the Marines. And I was like, "There's no way that dude will pass a piss test." Right this way, soldier. Hop in, bro. Let's chill. - I got some good shit in my car. - Nah. I can't. No. I'm, uh... I'm clean now. - You know, I gotta... - Be a good boy for Uncle Sam. Well, it seems like... ...your life's in ship shape. Except, uh, you owe me 15 grand. So, there's that. I need that money, bro. Don't worry, Johnno. I deploy next week. So I'll get you something by then. Whew. Okay, that's good, bro. That's good. 'Cause, uh... 'Cause if you're not good for it, I know where your family is. Arrgh! I'm playing with you, bro. See you soon. Shit! - Oh, good. - Mm-hmm. - Cassie, you got a letter. - Mom, don't open that. - Cass, you didn't pay your rent? - I said don't open that. Your place is falling apart. How can you live like this? Yeah, well, I'm busy, and the little details aren't really a priority for me. - You cannot not pay your rent, Cassie. - Well, I'm paying. I'm just paying late. I'm giving the landlord's daughter free piano lessons. They're not going to throw me out on the street. Why don't you move back with me? You can share my bedroom. - Ma! - Like when you were little. No, I'm not 12. I can't go backwards. Yes, but diabetes wasn't really in the budget, okay? I'm so worried. Why are you laughing? You're not taking this seriously. You could die at any moment. Mom! I know. I'm fine. I'm doing everything right. I'm bartending, and delivering food, and playing gigs, and teaching piano on my spare time. And I'm constantly exhausted and running late, and I can't sleep because I have this medical debt that just grows like some mold in a basement. So, please, please just be kind to me. Okay. Fine. Ma. I'm okay. I know. I'm sorry. I should be able to provide for you. Mommy, I love you so much. I don't want you to worry. You know me. I'm just on my own weird journey, and it's... it's a little bumpy, but... ...I love it. Thanks. I'm sorry.

Is it a plague? Robot wars? Do you really wanna know? It doesn't end well for the bros. Is that your car? My Lexus? Yeah. - Hi. Dude, the banners. - Come on in. - Your parents are so proud. - You know my momma. Would you mind giving us a minute? - Thanks. - Of course. Aw. Hey. Yeah, uh, Mom's going a little crazy with the goodbyes. Leave's over. We're headed to base camp today. - Hey, you hungry? Want something? - No, I'm good. So, what's the big question, girl? It's, uh... It's gonna sound a little crazy. I'm ready. I was wondering... I was hoping that you might marry me. - What? - I'm serious. Are you okay? Not exactly. Um... I found out six months ago that I have diabetes. Type 1. And, uh... Get this. Uh, the insurance I have doesn't actually cover the insulin that I need to like, live. So, I can either pay off my debt, or pay my rent, but I just... - I can't do both. - I'm so sorry. And I'm like, there's gotta be another way, right? Turns out there is. Your friend gave me the idea when you guys came to the bar. Marine spouses get full health benefits. And we get extra pay just for being married. Like basic housing allowance and separation pay, which adds up to be pretty decent, and we could split it, and everybody wins. What do you think? Take your time. I'm sorry. - My dad's a retired MP. - Excuse me. Private discussion. MP is the Military Police. Frankie, this is a common scam. They kick the tires on these things, and if they find out it's not real, it's fraud. Come on, man. I mean, you're better than this. Okay, no one asked you, so could you not? - And why wouldn't this be a real marriage? - I don't know, because you're not in love? Uh... But we respect each other. We're not in love, but we love each other. We'd be able to sleep with other people, which sounds like the healthiest marriage ever. You'd be ripping off the government. - I'd be ripping off the government? - Yeah. The government that made my mom pay taxes for ten years before giving her the right to vote? That government? So your mom was living here illegally then? Don't tell me you're a resident of Southern California that does not see how this state was built off the backs of illegal immigrants. Like my mom, who crossed that border, lived here for ten years, worked their asses off for ten years, paying taxes for your government, and were treated like less than citizens. Yeah, I will proudly rip off the government. You got anything else to say, Commando? Dude, this is a trap. This will not end well for you. - I was just trying to help. - Mmm. Thanks for your help. - Why is he even here? - He's my bunkmate, okay? He's got nowhere else to stay while we are on leave. Please play nice. So? Cass, I can't. Okay? I'm... I'm sorry. Plus, I don't think my girlfriend's gonna understand me having a wife. What? You got back together with Riley? Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm all in. I remember when you met her, like, in fifth grade. That's great. Well, that was crazy. I should go. There are tourists to be shuttled and food to be delivered. - Cass, you know if I had the money... - No, Frankie, stop. I'll figure it out. - Stay safe, okay? - Yeah, you too. Bye. Her parents can't help? Yeah, um... Her mom's a nursing assistant, so it's not like there's anything extra leftover. Dad dipped out when she was born. Sounds like he was a bad dude. That explains a lot. Hey! Are you trying to sneak up on me? Gonna make my going-away plate. Let's go get some food! Come here. Give me a kiss. Bye. All right, see ya. Bye, Grandpa. Love you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uncle Luke? What are you doing? - Think fast. - Yeah, you are. You ready? You ready? Give me the ball. - No, me. No, me. No, me. - Me. Mom, I found Uncle Luke hiding. - Oh my... Luke? - Busted. We didn't think we'd see you before deployment. - What? - Hi, Hailey. Wow. It's like hugging a tree trunk. I didn't think it was possible to get so buff in eight months. What do you think, Spence? Should I join the Marines? - Yeah. Yes. - Should I get all ripped like Uncle Luke? Yes! You, uh... You look just like Dad with that haircut. Gimme a hug. - Bring it in. - Good to see you, man. Where's he been? You know, Dad's off for the day, so you can breathe. I think he doesn't wanna see me even more than I don't wanna see him. The man would have to express some kinda emotion for me to know how he's feeling about you. - He made it clear when he cut me off. - Come on, Luke. Dad had to draw the line somewhere. You were so out of control. Yeah. What's going on, Luke? I owe some money. We've been here before, and you know... You know I can't help you. Yeah. No, no, I... I know. Is it that piece of shit Johnno, again? - What happens if you don't pay? - Not paying isn't an option. - He better not come near my family. - I'm sorry. - I'm just in a bad spot. - Mm-hmm. I... I just got my pay, so this isn't everything. - But I'll get the rest to you soon. - Like when? I'm losing my patience. I waited for you through your stupid rehab, and now you're shipping out of town, showing up with a coupla hundred bucks when you owe me 15 grand? - I think I've got a plan. - You better explain. Just take it easy, man. Don't make me use this. You gotta pay me. Hear me out. I'm gonna pay you. - I... I know how. - How? I met this girl who needs health insurance. And if we get married, I get extra money each month from the military. I'll give you my cut. Okay? - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. It's gonna be fine. So be smart. This better work. Enjoy your honeymoon. Hi. - Hi. - Thanks for meeting with me. Is your dad in the parking lot waiting to cuff me? Funny. You're acting kinda sus. Yeah. Well, if we do this, if... We need to be very careful. All right? We need a story. You and I didn't get along at the bar the other night. The others saw that, but the next night, I was very charming and persistent, and I convinced you to go out with me. - You did? - Mm-hmm. Was it hot? When you asked me out? Very. I'm sorry. I'm just gonna need you to explain yourself, because a week ago you were lecturing me on how this is fraud, so... - It is fraud. I don't wanna do this. - Okay, so... don't. Believe me. If I had any other choice, I wouldn't be. Marriage should be for love. And where I come from, it's for life. Do you come from a fantasy land? Because, where I come from in reality, marriage is really just a pointless legal arrangement that turns lovers into enemies, so... - Why don't you have another choice? - How's that your business? Kind of is. I am possibly about to marry you. Why? I need the extra two grand a month married guys get. That's it? And I'm supposed to trust you here? Trust me? Okay. Look, if I can trust a lib who doesn't give a shit about the law or the military, I can sure... I have an ethical code that doesn't include blind obedience, and I desperately need this to literally survive. Whereas you could be, I don't know, stockpiling supplies for your bro-militia. I'm leaving. This was a mistake. "Bro-militia." - Luke. Luke. - Liberal nut. What? Look, I don't like you. No shit. But you seem solid. So... I'm sorry, okay? Please. Listen. I need you to know what you're getting yourself into. If we're caught, I get court-martialed. As in, arrested and maybe doing time. Okay. Look, this is already gonna be a shotgun wedding. We're gonna be on their radar. So, once I get over there, to Iraq, we've... we've got to just, like, set up consistent times where we are gonna speak, okay? We gotta make this look normal, like a real marriage. We'd have to write some romantic emails in case somebody reads them. We just have to keep it tight for my tour. And once I'm back here, we file for divorce. And that gives you a year of free health insurance. And we can split the cash down the middle. - Yeah? - Great. And one more small thing. I deploy Friday morning. We'd also have to go out with my company. Act like we... Like we like each other. Yeah, more than that. Like, love each other. And, um... So, all married couples spend the night at this motel near base. - It means we would have to. - Super. So, are we out of "if" territory? Are we doing this? Yeah. Yeah, we're doing this. But you can't tell anybody that doesn't need to know. You have to promise. I promise. In fact, I pinky swear. - No, I'm not doing that. - We're getting married, man. I'll text you. - No. - What? You can't wear that. - Why? - Because we're taking wedding photos. You have to dress a certain way. - Really? - No. I'm coming up. There's no fluffy virgin white wedding dress in there, Commando. Stop calling me that. Make yourself comfortable. Do you play? No, it's just to impress guys. You impressed? I'm a musician. It's what I do. My band and I have been working at it for like, five years. That's gotta be rough. Rough would be punching the clock at some soul-sucking job while I'm just making the rich richer. I'd rather hustle for my art any day. - Uh... - Uh, hi. So, what does the tattoo say? "Socialism Now"? You're really clever. No, it says... - Someone, something, I... - Risk nothing, gain nothing. It's something my grandma said to my mom when she moved to America. Hello, my prince. Today is the day that our credit scores shall become intertwined. You know, you really look the part. - What does that mean? - You look pretty. Your blushing bride. Ahh! You look so beautiful! Congratulations. - Thank you. - Come on, give me a hug. We're so proud of you. This is the best day of my life. Oh my goodness. This is so exciting. Hi. Thank you for coming. Of course. Oh, did you get rings? - Uh... - Here. Oh my God, you bought a real ring? - Well... - Me. I did. - What? - I got it for Riley. - I've been saving up since I enlisted. - Frankie. No, I can't accept this. I didn't wanna ask her now and then just ship out. Like, I wanna be her husband. You know, do it right. And... And Mom wants me to wait 'til I'm 21, when I get back, so, uh... Just keep it warm for me. Luke Morrow and Casandra Salazar. Shit. We are gathered here today to join you two together in lawful matrimony. And your witness today? Frankie. That's me. How ya doing? - Hi, Frankie. - Hiya. Luke Morrow, do you pledge to love this woman, to be true and loyal to her, and to comfort and keep her in sickness and in health? I do. Casandra Salazar, do you pledge to love this man, to be true and loyal to him, and to comfort and keep him in sickness and in health? I do. By the power vested in me by the great State of California, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Congratulations. Drink up, boys! Here's to the second platoon, baby! Shipping out tomorrow. - On one! - Click it! Get in there. No shit! - Whoo! - Wait, wait, wait! - And to the newlyweds! - Adorable. Ah! - Considering you hated each other. - Look at you, guys. Thank you. Newlyweds! Dude, I can't believe you married her, and you're shipping out the next day. How are you doing? You know, a-about them leaving so soon? I'm... kind of freaking out. Yeah, it's, um... it's extremely surreal. I'm gonna miss him so much. I know Frankie's nervous. So I'm trying really hard to be brave. But he's my favorite person. - That's the problem. - Oh. Uh... Sorry. I'm a mess. Come on, get 'em up. I'd like to make another toast. This one is to life, love, and hunting down some goddamn Arabs, baby! Whoo! Really? Oh boy. Yeah! You got a problem with that? Yeah, you. It's just... Arab is an ethnicity, and you're making it sound like you're hunting down everyone of a certain ethnicity. - Which sounds kind of problematic. - Yeah, Cassie. He gets it. He's just stirring the pot. Thank you for the sensitivity training. All right? I'm out here serving my country. What are you doing? I don't know. Apparently, I'm telling a marine he shouldn't be hunting down Arabs. - Okay. No, no. - Let it go. And what exactly would you like us to do, huh? Go over there and teach them pronouns? How about starting with knowing who your actual enemy is, and not making disturbing generalizations. How about that? You watch your tone. Luke, get your girl. - Stop. - Excuse me? - He doesn't "get" me. - Yeah, he does. That's enough! Both of you. Sit down. Do what the man says. Now. - Thank you. - You too, man. God, I just love nuanced conversations like these. I should go check on my husband. - What the hell? - Oh, man. Those two are fiery. - You're this mad, really? - Yeah. You know what he meant. Okay, it's all bullshit bravado. And look, Armando is a dick. But I... I don't think you understand what we're preparing ourselves to go and do. Is it really worth ruining everybody's night for? I'm sure I wasn't the one who ruined the night. I'm sure it was your friend shouting, "Kill all Arabs." What, 'cause you were gonna have the best night if he didn't say that? Sitting at a table full of people you feel superior to. Not being a racist troll is kinda superior though, isn't it? Okay, yeah, but without guys like Armando, do you really think this country would be safe from terrorists? No, look, and you preach, "The future is female." How do you think those women feel in Iraq? You live in this bubble. - I can't stand it. - No, you're right. Because the obvious solution is guns. Send over a bunch of men with guns! Wow, they're off to a great start. - Perfect. Guns. What? - They see us. Come here. - I said they can see us, come here. - Okay. - Yeah, well, couples fight, dude... - You are so goddamn stubborn, just... Working through our differences. Okay? - Still looking. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Keep holding me. So in love. - See? They're hugging. - They're fine now. We're good. Yep. Good. Last night, baby! Ah, make it count, fellas! - Let's go big tonight! - In bed! Whoo! I love you, girl! Giddy up! Giddy up! Come on! - Good night. - Night. Have fun in the honeymoon suite! Nice one. - Huh. I... I asked for two beds. - Mm-hmm. Sure. Sure you did. All right, 'cause, what? Y-You think I'm into you? Maybe a little. - Just breathe, dude. - Well, 'cause I'm not. - All I know is you're a hot mess. - What is that supposed to mean? I don't know, because a normal person would just admit that they're scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. Okay. Well then, what's with the tough guy act? You're bossing me around, telling me to sit down. Please, stop. I can't do this. I'm not doing this. Big mistake. You're right. I'm scared. Between the marriage and Iraq, I'm kind of losing it. Uh... I'm sorry. Hey, you'd be absolutely crazy if you weren't. That was really brave. I should wash up. Cassie... Is this okay? Yes. - How long have you been up? - Since 3:00 a.m. I went for a run. You went for a run at three in the morning? - I couldn't sleep. - What? You heard me. I... I couldn't sleep at all. So, I went for a run. That's what I do. So, you're that guy? Pretend-it-didn't-happen guy. I don't know what you want from me. I just have a lot on my mind. - Okay. - We've gotta go to deployment. So I'll take you to base. Great. I've lived in Oceanside my whole life, and I've never been on base. Hey, I love you, man. I gotta go. Hey, Cassie, anything happens to me, you're my next of kin, okay? You can call my brother. Tell him about our deal. You'll have to make up a story for my dad. But please, my dad cannot know about this. All right? Okay. Lance Corporal Morrow, congratulations. Remember, from here on out, we're being watched, all right? Emails, video calls, everything. NCOs, move those men. Let's go! Hey guys, one more time for the newlyweds! - Hey! Come here, girl! - Let's get her. Let's get her. Come on, one last one. Pick her up. Oh, oh, oh! Here we go. There we go. Come get your bride! I'm sorry. Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! - Come on, get in there, Luke. - Kiss! Kiss! That's your last one for a long time. Okay. All right, love birds. Let's go. Let's move it. Take care of yourself, okay? I want a hit record when I come back, all right? - Yep. - Just for you. Bravo Company, on the bus! Let's move! Congratulations. Thanks. This doesn't even feel real. Dear Luke. We fell in love so quickly. I figured I'd write you and fill in the gaps that we didn't have time to fill. So... Here's what you need to know about me. Oh! ♪ Hoping... ♪ Music is... ♪ Come back home... ♪ ...my everything. ♪ Come back home ♪ ♪ Come back home ♪ I started as a kid just singing to myself to drown out what was going on at home. My mom had a string of boyfriends from the base who did nothing but make her miserable. We didn't talk about it. She, uh... She thought I didn't notice, but I did. So while most people learn to speak their feelings out loud or write them into a journal, I learned to make mine into music. My whole life, I've loved to sing, but I'm kind of terrified to sing what I have to say. ...feel a squeeze. So I sing covers. I hide behind someone else's words instead. Ironic since I have been told I'm more than opinionated. It's just every time I sit down to write something original, making a living and all my medical problems get in the way. Maybe that's a cop-out, but I guess now that we're married, I'll find out. Dear Cassie, here's what you should know about me. I'm a third-generation marine. My grandpa fought in the battle of Iwo Jima, and my dad got a Purple Heart for being injured in combat in Desert Storm. After high school, I kind of spun out. I thought that by enlisting, I could earn back my dad's respect. But now, that I'm actually here, I'm starting to understand I'm not doing it for him. I'm doing it for me. To serve my country and to, uh, be a better man. Hey, Luke, it's your boy, Johnno. I got last week's deposit. Keep faking that marriage. That shit's crazy. Anyway, get me this week's. Keep 'em coming. You know those freak thunderstorms they get by the beach? They used to scare the shit out of me. My dad was a hard-ass about it, but I remember once, he let my brother and me bring our sleeping bags in and crash on the floor. Our family like that, all together, when it was storming out, it's one of my best memories. Not long after that, my mom got sick, and my dad retired from the Corps to take care of her. He went to every single one of her chemo appointments. Sat up all night by her bed when she went to the hospital at the end. Hmm. That's what love means to me. I guess that's what I want for us. My dear husband. Car ride over plane ride. Breakfast tacos over late-night tacos, with lots of hot sauce. Lots of it. I've never left California, but my dream is to circle the globe with my band someday. If I were home more, I'd have a pet iguana. Shut up. They're highly intelligent. My darling wife. Nothing ruins a taco more than hot sauce. It totally kills the flavor. Someday I'm going to run a marathon in every major city. That's how I'm going to see the world. And I don't mean to burst your bubble, but an iguana isn't in the cards for us. The only pet I've ever had was a goldfish I won at the state fair. Hey, can you, uh... - Can you see me? - Yeah. Uh, can you see me? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Hi. Hi. Oh, your, uh, your best friend is here. - You remember my wife? - Yeah. I remember. The love birds. Luke, is that Cassie? Hi! - Riley says, "What's up?" - Hi, Riley. - Hey, Cassie. - How is it? Uh, you know, I got sand in my butt crack, so. Sounds fantastic. So, how was your day, babe? Uh, it was fine. Babe. I, um... I worked, and I started to write a song. Wait, you just wrote a song? Like, just like that? - Hey, Cassie, play it for us! - Play it for us! Play it! Play it! Play it! - Play it! Play it! - Come on! I mean, it's not... it's not finished. Play it for us! - Please. - Come on! Look, I'm hoping the song will be finished in, like, a week. Come on. Okay, okay. I promise. Guys, I promise I'll sing it for you guys then. All right, well, one week. You know where to find us. Hey, we should go, fellas. Chow time! By all means, chow. Love you, Cass! I, uh... I love you. Yeah, ditto. I love you, too. Love you. - Love you. - Love you. - Love you. - I love you too. - You love her? - I love you! ♪ You know where to find us ♪ ♪ Return home ♪ ♪ You know where to find ♪ ♪ Come back home ♪ Whoo! We should try that after the chorus. Yeah. ♪ Come back home ♪ - Think it's right? - Do that on bass, Max. It's freaking awesome. ♪ I want you to come back home ♪ - Sounded good. - We have a song! Yes! Hi. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, it's just chaos. We nearly lost one of the guys today. He just got airlifted out. Oh my God. Um, Frankie's here. Frankie, say hi. What up, Cass? - Hi. - Hey, uh... We could all use that serenade. Today was pretty ugly. Everyone's just trying to call their family. God. How do we not hear about these things here? Right, fellas? A little serenade from Luke's wife? Yeah? You did promise. Okay. Okay. I know... I know I promised, and it's... it's finally ready. I think it's ready? I've never really played my own songs for anyone yet. So, go easy on me.

They're gonna love it. - Actually... this, um, indie music site did a review of one of our last gigs that was just, like, insanely positive, and I guess this booker read it. And now, we have a slot at the Oceanside Alt-Fest. What? Like, the Oceanside Alt-Fest! That's crazy! You... You're doing the damn thing. Wait, so does this mean that I'm, like, your muse? No? Really?

Oh my God, Cass, your phone is blowing up. - What? - Of course it is. Germany? This is amazing, you guys. Sorry, guys, I gotta take this. - Who is it? - Don't know. - Just like five minutes, okay? - Better be a record deal. Hello? Yes. Is this Casandra Salazar? Yes. Yes, ma'am, this is Captain Curtis, Rear Detachment Commander for the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines. Ma'am, I'm calling because your husband has been wounded in action. He's going to be transferred from Germany to the Naval Medical Center in San Diego. Is he okay? His legs were injured during an IED detonation. He's currently undergoing surgery. No, this isn't happening. Sorry, but I'm having a hard time understanding you. Shit! Jacob Morrow. Jacob Morrow. Luke's brother, I'll find you. Can I help you? - I'm looking for Jacob Morrow. - You found him. Is Luke's brother here by any chance? It's important. I'm Luke's father. What's he done? What's he done now? - I really need to talk to his brother. - Stop. Cut the shit. What do you want? Is Luke in jail? He owe you money? What? Luke was wounded in combat. Sir. He's in Iraq. - Or he was in Iraq. - Wh... - He deployed a couple of months ago. - Hang on. I didn't even know he had enlisted. - How bad is he? - I haven't seen him. The Marines called me last night, and they said that... ...that his legs had been shattered, uh, by some kind of IED. Ah, Jesus. And that he would be here in a couple of days. - I'm so sorry. - Why'd they call you? I'm his wife. Surprise. I'm sorry, come on in. Lance Corporal Morrow? Back to U.S. soil. You look a little dizzy. Lance Corporal Morrow? So, your skin grafts were successful, but I'm gonna keep you on this wound vac for a week to help you heal. Right now, your family's here. You lean on them, you'll be on the mend before you know it. Right over here. Luke. Dad? Oh my God. Jeez, man, we could have lost you. You could've told us you got married. Yeah, congratulations. - Thanks. - Thanks. Hi. - Hi, babe. - Hi. I'm... I'm so sorry, honey. I never thought I'd see you in the Corps. I hear you're getting a Purple Heart. - Yeah. - That's an honor. You told Jake not to tell me you enlisted. Why? Why did you have to lie to me again? You'd have said I didn't think it through. I hope to get the chance to prove you wrong. Yeah, me too. So, how we doing? Give me the rundown, Doctor. Look, this is going to be a long rehab, and he's starting from zero. - Doctor, will he be able to run again? - It's combat medicine, you know. Let's get you walking first. Then we can talk about running. Thank you. Well, your mom would, uh... Your mother would've been heartbroken to see you like this. Hey. Let's give them a minute. Yes, sir. Thanks. I, uh... I went to the wrong Jacob Morrow. I'm so sorry. I... I was just scared for you... You've got to be kidding me, Cassie. What were you thinking? We are totally screwed. I told you he was Military Police. You failed to mention your dad and your brother have the same frickin' name, Luke. - It's fine. It's fine. - It's not fine. We'll just get a divorce, and you'll never have to see me again. No, no, no, he doesn't trust me already. He's already watching us. - No, he won't turn in his own son. - You have no idea. Even though he's retired, he still acts like a cop. Gotta keep it together. A couple months until I get back on my feet. We'll live together just till I'm done with supervised PT. W-We'll be off the radar. All right? Until then, we have to make them believe this is a real marriage. Luke, a couple of months? Wha... I don't... - What... What does that mean exactly? - We act like married people. Pretend. All right? You can do that. You can do that. Pretend, all right? - It's gonna be fine. - It is. We're gonna play house. Is Frankie gonna laugh or cry when he finds out about this? Shit. What? - No one told you? - What? Frankie, he's, um... The same mission as this. He, uh... He didn't make it, Cassie. No. I'm sorry, I... I can't be here. Local Oceanside resident Frankie Mubuthia has been killed in the line of duty. He was 20 years old. His family says that they are proud of his heroism and sacrifice in the name of freedom. His funeral will be held at Fort Rosecrans in San Diego. Aim. Fire. Aim. Hi. The service was beautiful. Frankie bought this for you. He was waiting to propose until he came home, and he asked me to keep it safe. But I know that he really would have wanted me to give this to you. It fits you perfectly. He loved you so much. Hospital staff... - What's he doing here? - I have no idea. Lance Corporal Morrow, congratulations. Sounds like y'all are headed home. Y'all live near the base? Oh. Uh... It all happened so fast we didn't really get a chance... - We didn't really live together. Yeah. - Yeah. Oh boy. Well, you will now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be taking care of you. Cassie, listen. I'll swing by the house, pick Luke up, and take him to PT two times a week. - Oh... Yeah. - Oh. No, you don't have to do that. Come on. It'll be great to reconnect with my son. Hear all about your whirlwind romance. - Wow. - You really, really don't have to do that. I heard you the first time. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. I'll see you soon. Good lord. Nice and easy. Easy, buddy. - Hold up for a second. - Is it okay? Home sweet home, bro. - You're living in a three-story walk-up. - Is there an elevator? - Ah, nope. - Lance Corporal Morrow. Here we go. I'm gonna get one step ahead of you. You're gonna need our help with the stairs for sure. Yep. We'll invite you in next time. Thank you all so much. Bye. Oh. You're a runner too, huh? It's a glucose gel. I have diabetes, remember? The reason we're married. Oh, speaking off, our wedding night was memorable, but we gotta set some boundaries here. Got it. I'll take the couch. I think there's some leftover Thai food in the fridge. I can't guarantee that it won't kill you. Oh, and I should warn you I'm not gonna be cooking for you... - You're freaking out. - Oh, what? And you're not? I mean, I've never even lived with a guy before. Oh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm feeling super. Stuck in a wheelchair three stories up. Well, is this what's happening? Right now? Like, we're just living together? With your dad coming in and out of my apartment judging if I pass the wife test? Because this isn't what we agreed to. Well, I'm sorry that my injury is inconveniencing you. - It must be so, so hard for you. - Don't put this on me, Luke. You can't be happy about this. Like, am I really the person you want taking care of you right now? No, no, no, you are not taking care of me. Please, don't. - Well, you're living with me! - To avoid a court-martial! What don't you understand about that? You could be charged too. Jesus! Let's just get through this. Super. Super. Jake just said that Dad's gonna be here in 20.

That's a sweet beach house you and your fake wife got. Is that why you haven't been paying me? 'Cause, uh, since you're married, technically your wife, she owes me now too. Yeah, Cass! - Hi. - Hi. You're back early. Yeah. - Okay, well, I'm, uh... I'm almost done. - No rush. Look at you. Doing so much better. Yeah. Slowly, slowly. Hold up, girl. Hey, Jake, you get a dog? You crazy? She's for you. Her name is Peaches because she's from Georgia. Peaches, hi! Sit. Paw! Good girl! See? We got training and everything already done for you. We read that dogs can be really helpful for guys like you, healing from injuries like yours. - Oh, really? - I read it. - Then she texted me. - I don't need you plotting behind my back. Well, too bad, because it's good for you. Guys like me? Guys like me. What? Like a cripple? I don't need your pity. All right, have it your way! Listen, I know what's good for me. I can make decisions for myself. People don't say "cripple" anymore. This is bullshit. You know, it's okay to accept help sometimes. What the hell, Luke? See? Peaches gets it. Fine, I'll take her. - Good girl, Peaches. Good girl. - Good girl! Luke? Hey, Peaches, where's Luke? Hello? Luke? Oh my God. - You're walking. - Barely. Hurts like a bitch. - You know, apparently, I'm a psychic. - Oh yeah? Because though I would usually just get myself breakfast tacos. This morning I woke up, and I thought, "I wonder if Luke deserves one?" - Oh. One? - Oh, calm down. I got way too many. I even got our dog a taco. Right, Peaches. Yeah. Did you fix the doorknob? Mm-hmm. Thanks, I guess. You know you can let a guy help you and still be a feminist, right? I'd rather have a broken knob than have you lecture me on feminism. Oh, okay, so you wanna live on an island of broken doorknobs? Why don't you say, "Luke, you're wrong." - "You don't understand me." - Luke, you're wrong. - You don't understand me. - I'm not. Really? Well, I'm doing okay on my own. Maybe I don't need the chaos of someone having my heart or whatever. Hmm. Oh no. No more tacos if you do that. - Do what? - "Hmm." Just say the damn thing. Okay. The same reason you and I wouldn't work. You don't believe in love. Wow, I had no idea that Psych 101 was part of basic training. Well, you realize I'm a marine, right? So, the training is not exactly basic. Oh yeah, I've seen the movies. I've done my homework. I'm a proud military wife, after all. You don't wanna date a guy that you actually like because that would mean, you know, you'd have to give up control and let someone in. Okay, yeah. Well, maybe having control issues just means that I'm being smart. So maybe you don't know what you're talking about. Mmm, that's fake news. Because when it comes to control issues, I'm self-taught. You? You seem so chill. Listen, it's this, or I'm breaking six laws, going 120 down the 405 with no pants on. So... Metaphorically? Hard to picture. Not that I'm picturing it. Okay. What kind of freak skips out on the Tapatío? Wow. You know, you snowflakes are just... You're so judgy. Don't start this. Okay, control freak, you ready to let go? - Hell yeah. - Drive on the wild side? - Bring it on. - Pants down? - Are you ready for this? - Yeah. Bring it on. - Ready? - Yeah. On three. One. Two. Three. Do you wanna spit it out? It's not spicy. Oh my G... Can't breathe. No, I'm totally fine. - I go... - Spit it out! - No! - You're gonna lose. Okay, I can't. Agh! - Victory is mine! - Oh my God. I'm bleeding from my eyes. I'm bleeding from... Yes! Oh wow. I won. - You lost. - I got something for you. It's in my back pocket. Gimme one second. Here it is, right there. Ah! I'm in pain. I'm in so much pain. You are sweating. Here. Oh. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Why would anyone do that to themselves? I don't understand. - You're sweating too. - No. This isn't sweat. This is a glow. Maybe we should watch a movie or something. I can smell the jalapeños coming out of your pores. So, uh... Maybe you take a shower first. Well... Getting in the shower means standing up for a long period of time, which means radiating pain. Okay, then take a bath? - It's gonna just make you feel better. - Getting in the tub is also a nightmare. Here. It's not pretty. - I can do that myself. - Just let me. I see how hard you've been working at it, and you'll run again, Luke. I believe in you. Why don't you sleep in the bed tonight? Hi, Peaches. - Hi, good girl. - Hey, baby. Okay. Yeah, you wanna go that way, all right. God, I haven't been back here in so long. Remember, my dad doesn't trust me. - He's gonna be watching everything. - Dude, don't worry. I mean, look at us. We're so cute and suburban, it's disgusting. Come on, Peaches! Okay, guys, I want you to listen to a song. All right, ready for this? She's my new favorite artist. - I hate you. - What? - I like this song. - Uncle Luke, play football with me. - You bossing me around? - Yeah. - Okay. - Come on, Uncle Luke. No, he's got an injury, little man. Let your uncle take it easy. - Take it easy? - Uncle Luke's hurt. Take it easy? Oh, heck, no. All right. - You sure? - You're my walking stick. - Be careful. - She's right. - Yeah. - Hey, let me see that ball. - Oh! Nice throw! - Oh! I guess we're doing this. Yeah.

Do you understand me? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. This is everything I owe you. We're done. I miss you like hell, man. I hope you know that. Hey, Frankie... ...you wanna hear something crazy? I think Cassie Salazar's my best friend. I do. I love you. Hi. What's going on? I just spoke to my mom. Oh. How's she doing? She called because she was freaking out. She was trying to get into her car just now, and some guy with blood on his shirt rolled up, wanting to talk about you. Oh. About you and me, and how we're in a fake marriage. Threatening to turn us in. She'll understand why though, right? Why aren't you asking me who it was? Fuck you, Luke. Fuck you! - I'm sorry. - You owe him money? This guy said. And that he sent you a message last night? I'm sorry. Okay? I'm so sorry. They broke into my mother's house, Luke! - I... I am so sorry. - Did you know? You must have, right? That's why you said you'd pay for the damages. - Can you let me explain? - Yes! I'm an addict. I'm clean now. - Two years sober, okay? - And what? This guy was your dealer? That's why your dad stopped talking to you. Because you were using. When my mom died, I, uh... I got into her medication just to cope. But when I ran out, Johnno was right there to help me. - What does that have anything to do... - Okay. Yeah. I stole a $50,000 car from my dad. A classic Corvette. He was rebuilding it for one of his biggest customers. And I broke in. I was out of my mind, and... I was desperate. I was gonna sell it, and instead, I just... took it on the freeway, and I totaled it. And he said if I didn't pay that customer back, he'd turn me in himself. You weren't kidding about him. Whatever I didn't have, I borrowed from Johnno. This is why you needed to marry me. Yeah. Yeah, but look. I dealt with him. Okay? I paid him. It's done. They could have hurt her, and she's the only thing that I have. - I know, Cassie. I know, I know. - No. No. Don't... Don't just walk away. Okay, I'm sorry. Not every man you let into your life is a bad guy that you can't trust. Really, Luke? What are you? I am someone who shows up when you need me. I don't need you. I don't need you. Just listen, okay? I am so sorry. - I messed up. - Go stay at your dad's or your brother's. And tell them that we're getting divorced.

Marina, promoter from The Hollywood Bowl, wants you to open for Florence and the Machine in a couple weeks. What? The Loyal and Florence and the Machine. - What? - This is massive! Hollywood Bowl! Lance Corporal Morrow, I need you to return to base with me. I'll give you a few minutes to grab your gear. Hello? Luke wants you to know that he's been charged with fraud and detained. They've said you two have a fake marriage in order to get benefits. Is this true? Wait, where is Luke? I'm headed to base to see him now. There's gonna be a trial in a few weeks. Then you'll also be hearing from the police about your role in all this. - Was it all an act? - Uh... No. Not... Not all of it. Even I thought you were good for him. I thought you were bringing my son back to me. Hi. All rise. Good morning. Be seated. We're here today for a hearing in the case of Lance Corporal Luke A. Morrow. Lance Corporal Morrow stands accused of entering into a fraudulent marriage in order to collect BAH and FSA pay in violation of article 132 of the UCMJ. We have a signed affidavit from Jonathan Deluca's testimony of the fraudulent marriage. Lance Corporal Morrow's wife, Miss Salazar, is a civilian. So, her case will be referred to state authorities, and they may pursue criminal charges. They will have access to the transcripts of these proceedings. - I wanna make a statement. - Lance Corporal, I can't advise that. If you don't say anything, we have a good chance of winning. Tell the judge I'd like to make a statement. Lance Corporal Morrow, how do you plead? Your Honor, my client wishes to speak. What? Luke. You may proceed. Sir. I coerced Miss Salazar into marrying me. Um, she didn't know that it violated military law. - I assured her it didn't. - No. I bear full responsibility, and I'm prepared to face the consequences of my actions. Very well. Then I find you guilty. Lance Corporal Morrow, upon completion of your sentence, you'll be discharged for bad conduct. You will report for your six-month sentence tomorrow at 1700 hours. Given the outcome of this trial, this court will not refer Miss Salazar's case to the local authorities. Do you pledge to love this man? To be true and loyal to him and to comfort and keep him in sickness and in health. I do. By the power vested in me by the great State of California, it is my honor to pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Oh my God, it is so full out there. - Please take your seats. - Whew. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Cassie Salazar and The Loyal. Hi. - Right there? Thank you. - Yeah. Right here. Hi, Billy. How we doing, Hollywood Bowl? Hey, Luke, you ready? I'm sorry to say, but it's time. I didn't know I'd still get this. Mm.
