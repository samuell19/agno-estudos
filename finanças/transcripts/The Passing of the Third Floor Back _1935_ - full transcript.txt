Oh, dear. What are you doing? Oh my goodness, you didn't have to startle me! You wait till old Sharpe gets on to you. She'll startle you all right. Look at the time! What have you been doing? Get a move on. Don't stand mooning there. Get a move on! Stasia. Stasia! There you are. Now you're for it. What's the matter? Why don't you answer the bells? Lady's too busy watering our flower garden to do any work. Don't blame me if the dinner party is a failure. What's this? What's this? Where does this come from? - I found it. - Found it. Up to your old tricks again, eh. It's nearly dead. Nobody wanted it. I'm not talking about this. I'm talking about my bowl. - Oh, no! - Yes! It wasn't being used. I only wanted to borrow it. Same sort of borrowing I suppose that got you into the reformatory. - It wasn't a reformatory! - Industrial School then, home for good-for-nothings. - You're not gonna take it away! - My bowl I most certainly am. My flower, my flower! You can't take it away...! I don't want your little flower. There you are! It broke. Get on and answer those bells. You hateful. Hateful! If only there was one decent person... But there isn't. There isn't. Well, you asked for it. You've got it. Oh, shut up. You better get rounded (up waters?) you don't want some more trouble. Fat lot I care about them. Well, you know they're all bursting to get down to the engagement party. Engagement party, and him old enough to be a father. Don't forget his champagne. One bottle between eight. Mean old pig. Fat lot of life Miss Vivian's got. If ever she does marry him. - She'll marry him all right. Can't afford not to with them parents. Poor Miss Vivian. Vivian! Vivian, darling. Now, Vivian. You... Of course if you want to see your father in prison... Rubbish. I wish it were. Now darling, why not let me announce the engagement? I can't see any harm in that. - Can't you? Well, at least it would tide things over until... Until you could find a higher bidder for me. Don't be indecent. Darling, will you help me fasten my dress? Look at the way you put it down. You spilt half of it. Oh well, it’ll have to do with the (indiscernible). I shall report you to Mrs. Sharpe. I shouldn't, Mother. She might present the bill. Stasia. Stasia! Come along, hurry up whatever have you been doing? Get the buckles off the cocktails and a jug of water. Is that the major? Ah, Major Tomkin. May I have a word with you? - Dear lady, the urgencies of the moment... I shan't keep you a second. Sit down. May I remind you, Mrs. Sharpe, that on this particular occasion I'm rather in a hurry? I seem to heard that before somewhere. The last time I presented my account, to be precise. I suggest, Mrs. Sharpe, that you accept a post-dated cheque for 100 pounds payable in three months. By which time the chances are that my daughter will be Mrs. Wright and I shall be in a position to pay. Meanwhile I go on keeping all three of you. Put it to you as a gamble. Vivian hesitates but that's natural. Family pride, Mrs. Sharpe. There is such a thing as family pride. Now, a businessman is always prepared for business, Mrs. Sharpe. Let me see, today is... There you are. Mind you, if this isn't met... It shall be met, Mrs. Sharpe. On the honor of a soldier. I'm putting my trust in Miss Vivian. Chris! Chris. Yes, Vivian? You're... You're not staying in tonight for the dinner, are you? Why not? Don't, please. I heard your Mr. Wright is giving champagne. I don't see why I should miss that. - Chris... - I may as well see it out to the end. Don't make it any harder for me than it is. If it's so hard, why are you going through with it at all? I can't help myself. Vivian. Aren't you dressed yet? - No, Mother. - Well, go and finish then. We mustn't keep Mr. Wright waiting. No, no. Mr. Wright mustn't be kept waiting. Vivian, what have you been saying to him? Oh, leave me alone, Mother! How's Vivian? - Very edgy. - She being difficult? - Yes, rather. - Well, she's got to come to heel. - Is anything wrong? - I've just given Sharpe a post-dated cheque for 100 pounds. - George! - But I had to do something! Well, hurry up and dress. You don't want to be late. No, I don't want to be late tonight. Has our musical genius provided us with a theme song...? Yes. What do you think of this? For the bride-to-be. I can't give you anything but love, baby. Father's debts are all I've plenty of, baby. Be careful, don't crack the enamel. Does that pass for wit gramophone shop? - Yes, please Miss. Good evening, Mrs. Tomkin. - Good evening. May I join you? I'm not interrupting a tête-à-tête, am I? What time did the major get in last night? Half past eleven forty to twelve. (indiscernible) all right. Drunk? Oh, the usual. A bit fuddled you know. And when will we be allowed to congratulate dear Vivian on their engagement? Before dinner or after? I really don't quite know what has been decided. Children nowadays, you know... Dear, I do hope nothing's gone wrong. She's worked so hard for it, hasn't she, poor child? Dear Miss Kite, at Vivian's age hard work isn't necessary. Natural charm and a natural complexion. Ah, there I think Vivian's been so wise. Makeup doesn't suit her, and... How should I put it? Rather innocent type. But old men do so fall for that, don't they? Look who's honouring us. Baronet's cousin, dear Mrs. Dooley. Oh, I beg her pardon. Mrs. De Hooley. We're just talking about you, dear. I was in two minds about coming down. Bad news! What a loss! Not your cousin the baronet. The marquis. He was the head of our line. Mr. Larkcom. You've got a rival outside. Sounds very like one of your records. Shall I open the window a little way for you? Better not, Miss Kite. They see a lady, they expect something. Stasia, you go and open the window a little. Oh, go on. Why not pay up (indiscernible) and enjoy the luxury of feeling honest? (indiscernible) - You do as you're told. Baggage! What did you expect? Considering where she came from. I'm surprised you don't give up, Mrs. Sharpe. It's all right. I'm just giving her enough rope. There you are, you see it's the type. The little unfortunates always revert to type. - And you'll revert to an old tabby cat! - That will do! You know you're asking for trouble. - I don't care. - Don't care was made to care. - Poo, think I'm afraid? You can only send me back. Well, go on. Send me back. I'm sick of having it flung in my face where I came from. Send me back! It wouldn't be any worse than this rotten hole. - You'll keep a civil tongue in your head! - Well, so it is. And a lot of rot's in it. Look at them, there isn't a decent one among them. You're talking a lot of nonsense you don't know anything about. And I don't want to know. They're not human, that lot. None of us are. Look at you, you're an old thief. How dare you! Oh, I'm just as bad. Worse. What are we all living for? What I want to know... What's the good of us? Miss Kite's perfectly right. You're a useless little slut. You'll go back to the gutter where you came from! all right! I will...now! Stasia! Come back! Where do you think you're going? The river! Anywhere, I don't care! - Good evening. - What do you want? I understand you have a room to lend. Well, we haven't. No? But... Will you please come in? Thank you. No, no, please. Please, will you wait a minute? Thank you. What is it? What are you grinning at? He wants the room. Room? What room? - The third floor back! - Third fl... Who is it? Who is he? What's he like? A gentleman. Here, I'd better go. I'm afraid there's been a mistake. You see, my... - Good evening. Good evening. As I was saying, my maid put a card up unknown to me. But you have a room to let? As a matter of fact... Do you mind coming along to the office? -Thank you. After you. Thank you. Now, then. Oh, thank you. Now, then. Now we can talk business. To begin with, I know you'll excuse the question. What are you? - I? I'm a wanderer. You mean a traveller? Yes, a traveller. For pleasure or...? For pleasure. Are you from abroad? I've seen so much of the world. What we call a cosmopolitan. Exactly. You see, I have to be a bit particular. We try to keep ourselves rather, if I may say so on the select side here. You see, we have the army represented in the person of Major Tomkin and family. Then there is big business in the person of Mr. Wright. I expect you've heard of rise housing estates in Poplar. One of the most populated districts (indistinct) I'm sure. Then there is Mr. Penny, rising architect. I'm forgetting Mrs. De Hooley. Her second cousin by marriage is the baronet, you know. I live so out of the world. And there's Miss Kite, one of the moderns. And Mr. Larkcom interested in music on the commercial side. Yes, I think we can claim to be a very representative little circle here. I shall be glad to meet them. Of course you'll understand, that my charges are a little higher than the ordinary boardinghouse. Of course. For the room I have to offer you overlooking my little back garden very quiet, lots of fresh air. Yes, very quiet indeed. And lots of fresh air. I usually ask two pounds ten a week. To you, Seen the time of year, shall we say...two pounds? Is that quite fair? - Fair? - I mean to you. I can afford to pay your proper price. Two pounds will be quite satisfactory. - Quite sure? - Quite. It's very kind of you. Very kind indeed. - Light of course will be extra. - Of course. - And gas. - Of course. I leave myself entirely in your hands. I shall be safe. How peaceful. You like London? Oh, yes. I like it very much, Then you'll take this room? If you will have me, of course. Let me see, you'll want some money in advance, won't you? Thank you very much. I’ll give you a receipt later. - Thank you. By the way. We're having a little party tonight. Mr. Wright, the property (indistinct) is getting engaged to Major Tomkin's daughter. How charming. Very much in love? Well, it's a good match from both points of view so we're having a party. Throwing the tables together and all being very sociable. I hope you won't mind. Just for tonight. I should be delighted. - Seven thirty then. - Thank you. I'm afraid you'll find us a very strange galère. Oh, thank you. But there takes all kinds to make a world, doesn't it? And all so interesting. I feel we're going to have a great deal in common. I beg your pardon? Haven't we met somewhere? (indistinct) in 1927 perhaps. My dear husband's cousin's a Humphrey, you know. At the (indistinct) Almost everyone was there at one time or another during the season. I wasn't. Were you, Wright? You must find it very crude over here. Even in the best hotels one is liable to meet with every class on individuals. As I was saying to the dear Duchess Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words. As you may or may not all know, I'm a man of property. Oh, I make no bones about it. I'm a self-made man. And every penny I've made has gone into the safest thing I know. Bricks and mortar. Safety first, that's my motto. They can strike, they can go on the dole, they can play old Harry with the country but they must have a roof over their heads. They say you can't collect in the poor districts. Don't tell me. I've collected for the past 15 years and I shall go on collecting. It's all a matter of character. And so take my tip, ladies and gentlemen, and put your money in bricks and mortar and keep it there. Well, having got that off my chest... Well, I'm going to make a little confession. I suppose every man makes a fool of himself some time in his life. Or more than once. Well, my turn come now. I needn't tell you what my little spot of bother is. Or how I feel about it. But, all I can say is it's got me pretty bad. To the tune of 500 quid to be precise... Hooray! Tied up to this little bit of nonsense. Perhaps some of the ladies would like to have a look. How wonderful. Extraordinary. Just like the dear Duchess's. Flawless. Oh, lucky girl. Stop it, stop it! The monkey's got the ring! Excuse me, lady! He's fond of pretty things. Give it back at once! Good luck, sir. Good luck, lady! May all your troubles be little ones. - Go away! - For the music! - We don't give to beggars. Get out, my man, or we put the police on your track. We hate it, go away. We don't encourage foreigners. You fat (indiscernible) of a swine! Miserable lot of devils! I hope your food chokes you! Well, ladies and gentlemen. I give you a toast to the future Mrs. W. - Good luck. - Your health! Yes! Your health. Mrs. W. Well, aren't you going to put it on? Vivian, wake up darling. Vivian! Well, I've had enough of this. I'm off. Come, come my dear. You go on after her. I look after him. Well, really. Extraordinary performance. Wasn't the ring good enough for her or what? Well... Shall we take coffee in the drawing room? My dear fellow, you mustn't take it like that. What do you expect me to do? Laugh and clap hands? Don't you see what it means? Yes, as plain as the nose on your face. - She hates my guts. - Nonsense, my dear fellow. Not at all, it's just nerves. Nerves. Wait a minute! I bet you what you like she's up there on that bed, crying her eyes out and wondering what on earth she can do to make it up with you again. Yes, yes my dear fellow. Mother. Don't seem to realise we're all going to be turned into the street by that horrible woman? They're always sniggering and whispering. What do you think of that dress she was wearing tonight? - Not a penny on that thing. - My dear, I wish I could afford that dressmaker's bill. Must be enormous. Poor thing. She needed it. It's rather reminiscent of a prize rabbit, don't you think? You clumsy slut. Well, it's your own fault. You shouldn't put it on the floor. What's the table for? You little prison rat. A lot you know about tables or anything else where you come from. Well, I certainly haven't learnt much here. Now run away, run away, now. Don't be a (indiscernible). - May I have your cup, please? - Thank you. May I help you? I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment. I beg your pardon? That child. - I like her. - Does you credit, of course. But isn't (indiscernible) a bit out of date? What do you mean? Can one extend one's sympathies outside one's own class like that? Perhaps it's because of my wider experience. Granted, granted. But human nature is human nature all the world over. And you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. How admirably expressed, dear Mrs. De Hooley. Remember that my dear man, won't you. Hello. Have you heard the Rhythm Brothers version of this? Pretty hot, hey? I liked as you were playing it just now. The old-fashioned straight stuff? Any fool can play that. Not as you were playing it. You think I’m not too rotten on the ivories, eh? You have talent. Really? But what's the good of it? I gotta be a top-notch (indiscernible) good at that. In more senses than one. You must hear some of my records! Perhaps you're not keen on (indiscernible) Oh, yes, yes. But not all the time. For instance, tonight. So many hearts must be longing for music like that. Tonight. Good night, Mother. Good night, darling. Somehow it was like that music. And then he said... thank you. That's something I haven't heard these six months. Nor am I likely to. Perhaps I'm wrong, but somehow I think things are going to be different. Good night. Good night, old chap. Oh, please. May I... I'm so sorry for what happened tonight. I do hope you don't think we're always like that. No, no. I understand. Good night. Good night. Could I speak to you for a moment? Of course Will you come in? How beautiful. You mind telling me what you know about her? What I know? What's the influence you have over her? I watched her all through dinner. - She never took her eyes off you. - You are wrong. I watched her too. It was you who was in her mind. And she's very unhappy. I know, I behaved pretty badly. But it wasn't just that! - Believe me, it was. Will you forgive me if I speak frankly? I'm a stranger to you and because of that perhaps I'm able to see you all a little more clearly than you see yourselves. You love each other but for some reason you are denying it. Well, there's not much mystery about as far as she's concerned, is there? She's turning me down for a better match. That's not what I saw. Well, what did you see? Another motive. Not the selfish one. You mean she's sacrificing herself for her parents? Partly. But also for another. I thought it was for you. What's the good of talking about it? You're quite right, of course. And it's my fault. She thinks she's saving my career. She thinks if we marry it would be a failure. And I made her think it. I put it into her head because I hadn't the courage to accept the responsibility of marriage. And those ghastly parents. I've been a complete spineless lunatic. The hair of it is is that I've only realised when it's too late. - Is it too late? - Of course it's too late! She despises me. She thinks I'm a (indiscernible)? I don't believe that. Do you think...? No. I know how I've let her down. I shouldn't waste time on the regrets. Good night. What's the motto? Catch them young, treat them rough and tell'em nasty... Well, good night future father-in-law. Hello. Hello. Come in here a sec. - It's too late. - No, no, no. C'mon. Phew, it’s going to be a scorcher today! Yes. Some's going to enjoy their bank holiday. Good morning. Oh, good morning sir. Lovely day for a bank holiday, isn't it? - Yes, lucky for everyone. Yes, I hate it when it rains, (indiscernible). - Where are you going today? - Me? I don't get out on bank holidays. They're always home, you see. - I see. Of course, when I was a kid I used to go out. We used to go down to Battersea park and watch the steamers on the river. Once we were going on one to Hampton Court with the Sunday school But I got the mumps and another girl had to take my place. She brought me back some lovely roses. They were a bit dead but you could still smell them. Excuse me, they're waiting. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, old man! Good morning. How do you like our London weather? It's a beautiful day, isn't it? The day for the country or the sea. Will you wait till this afternoon, there's gonna be a regular scorcher. You won't be able to breathe. Good morning. - Good morning. - It's going to be a lovely day, I think. I put you at that table over there. Thank you. Do you mind if I open the window? Oh, there's your friend with a gramophone again, Mr. Larkcom. I believe it's a publicity stunt. You're not suggesting that's one of our records, are you? Isn't it? Has the same delightful scratchy sound. Hey! Can't you play something more modern? Tiger Rag or something. Come, have a look at this. - What's all the excitement? Gosh, what a lovely sky. Almost Mediterranean, isn't it? Never seen it. Except on the pictures. Still I wouldn't mind being there. It's hot. You Londoners are so lucky to have your river. That's an idea! I wouldn't mind to get a boat out for the day. It'd be hard work pulling a boat. What about a steamer? Steamer! Well, that's more like you (indiscernible). Why shouldn't we all go? - On a steamer? - Yes. Down the river to the sea. I mean... as my guests. That's very nice of you, old man. - Do you mean everybody? - Yes. I think that's a splendid idea. - What about you, Miss Kite? - Me? Oh well, if it's going to be a party... It would give me great pleasure. I'd love to. And Stasia. Me? Stasia? Why not? If Mrs. Sharpe spares you. Well, I don't know what the Tomkins are doing, or Mr. Wright... Leave it to me! And Mrs. De Hooley. Won't you change your mind? - Yes, do Mrs. De Hooley. But I... You don't want me. - Of course we want you. The party would be incomplete without you. You can act as cook's guide for us. I really don't know what to say. You must come, really! You must come. Oh, you must come, you must! They're all going to the river! - Who? Everybody! Mrs. De Hooley and Miss Kite. Your Chris and even old Sharpe herself! Then your lodgers are throwing a party! And they say, if you go I can go! - Oh, Stasia, you little... - But it's a fact, really! What's all this about? There's a party! You're all invited! - It's free! - Where? - On the river. - But it's free. Free! I think I'll go. Vivian, after last night... Run along Stasia and say I should love to. Oh, what about you two? I really think it sounds a jolly good idea. - George. - Why not? It's free! They're all going! At least, I haven’t asked Mr. Wright... Oh, I see... I'll go and ask him now. Wait a minute, I think I can arrange this! Maybe a chance to patch things up. I'll fix it. Come in! Hello old fella. I say, feeling rotten? - Horrible. - Oh, that's bad. We must do something about that. Nothing. Bed. Nonsense, we can't have that! We've got a big day in front of us. What about a trip to Market? - Market? Please. Oh, make him say yes. Make him say yes, make him say yes... Don't you see my dear fellow? It's absolutely perfect. Invigorating breezes, romantic surroundings, Vivian repentant. Plenty of opportunities per tête-à-tête. Return home triumphant. I don't believe a word of it but you win. I fixed it. Tails. I thought you said Vivian was sorry for her behaviour. She's been deliberately avoiding me ever since we got on the boat. My dear fellow, when would you realize that there's a time and a place for everything? Extraordinarily green the water is. Yes, isn't it? I was a swine last night. It's all right Chris. I know how you felt. But that's no excuse for me trying to hurt you. Oh, please darling. It's forgotten. You're not going on with it now, are you? - I don't know. Oh, you can't. Don't you see how difficult it is? What will happen to mother and father? There must be a way out for us without hurting them. I've thought and thought about it till I can't think anymore. Chris, I shan't be able to bear it if I have to lose you. Vivian! You won't have to. I will find a way. We must find a way, darling. If only we could. Oh, it's so hot! - Such a nice breeze, though. - Yes. Oh, look! Did you see the (indiscernible) Tower? Those walls are eighteen feet thick! If they locked you up in there you could scream your inside out they'd never hear you. Isn't it wonderful? Fetch Mrs. De Hooley a cushion there, be a good girl. I'll show you where. Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Over to the right, Sheila. Hold it. Okay, come on girls. - Do you mind if I join you? - No, no, do! I'll arrange myself at your feet. Sit down, please. Sorry. Will you be comfortable there? - Thank you. - This intolerant sun, I mean. It's beautiful. Women of my age have to think of these little things. I'm gonna make you a confession. You'll probably think it's very outré of me. You interest me. I'm so glad. Are you? Why? I wanted to interest you. You are clever. You have wit. And a witty woman can be the best friend in the world. You think I'm clever? - Most certainly. - And witty? Indeed. - Don't mean catty? -No, no. A little caustic, perhaps. I suppose one grows bitter as one grows old. Old? Yes, old. Wrong side of (indiscernible). For goodness sake, don't start telling me it's a beautiful age. I couldn't bear it. Beauty is not a matter of age. Oh yes, it is. Age is ugly. It's no good talking a lot of nonsense to me about the beauty of the mind, of the soul. I never wanted that. I only wanted... I... Ah, there you are! Mrs. De Hooley says... Miss Kite, is there anything wrong? You look ever so pale. - I'm... Can I get you anything? Can I get you a lemonade? Yes, if you don't mind. Okay, Miss Kite. Back in a sec. Oh, Mr. Wright. Would you get me a lemonade, please? It's for Miss Kite. -What will you have? - A lemonade for Miss Kite. - What about you? - No, thanks. - Come on, it's a holiday. - Please, I've got to get back. You're going to have a drink with me first. all right, nothing for Kite. all right, then I'll have a lemonade. Youth, youth. Not that I care for this complete disregard of decency nowadays. You don't agree? - If you mean those children... - Children? They seem to be very happy. I'm afraid I'm not very interested in child welfare. Or in children at all, if it comes to that. Or in life? Life? I've told you. Life is a fraud. Stasia! Quickly, quickly! What is it? What is it? - Miss Kite, she's swimming off to Stasia. - Old Kite? I don't believe it. Do something! Do something, can't you? There you are! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Is she all right? Yes. Where's Miss Kite? Where is she? Hip hip hooray! Come on, swallow it down. - What is it? - Nevermind, get it down you. Oh, it'll make me drunk. Well, better a drunk hero than a dead one, as the poets say. Don't be silly. You can be as modest as you like, that was a real fine bit of work. As not many would've had the pluck. That's very nice of you, Mr. Larkcome. And it wasn't only the doing it, it was the way you did it! No fussing nonsense, that's the kind I like. You're making me very embarrassed. Oh, heavens! Don't do that! You look grand. What's all this? She's asleep. It might be the old days when Vivian was a kid. George, I've been wondering if we're doing right about her. I know. I was thinking about it when the accident happened. I felt as if I were losing my own child. I don't know why but I'm quite excited. This year I suppose (indiscernible). C'mon Mrs. De Hooley! We're nearly in! - I don't think I'm going ashore. - Good gracious, me! Why not? - I'm not feeling myself. - But you're missing all the fun! Come and join in. You will soon feel better. Well, if you think so. Is everything all right, dear? I feel a bit odd. Mr. Larkcome been leading me astray. (Indiscernible). Did you hear it? Oh, I forgot to give it to you back. - Wouldn't you like to keep it? - Me? - Yes. Or don't you think it's good enough? Not good enough? Isn't there some other way out? - Well, of course there's a way. Work! - That's easy enough to say. - There's that travelers job that Stephens offered to me. Don't be absurd. You couldn't stand that for a week. - But of course I should! If it were for all of this. It's better than selling one's own flesh and blood. Hold it, sir! Hold it. Thank you. Now what should we call the picture? Love's young dream? Dreaming you'd coming into a fortune or something? No, I was wanting to talk to you that little arrangement we made. I think it could be better if we settle the matter by direct payment. - What's the idea? What's the matter with the way we fixed it? Well, uhm... I'm thinking things over. I don't feel justified in asking Vivian to make the sacrifice. Sacrifice? Yesterday it was an honor! Well, what I really mean is... I don't think we need to argue about it. That's how we feel. You'll excuse us, won't you? - I see. Well, it's up to you. Well. You had a successful day. They look tired but happy. I mean you. You've done your stuff very nicely, haven't you? You mean giving them a good time? - You know what I mean. Perhaps I do. It's not easy for them to find themselves. The illusions are so strong. You mean the realities. They can't see them now. It's all lovely and rosy. Star and moonshine. You've got them all gooey and dripping with sentiment. That's all right. Wait till the morning. Wait till they have to face a few cold facts in the light of day. I'll give you best tonight. My turn in the morning. How much longer you're going to be in there? Good morning, I'm afraid I first claimed. - But look at the time! - I'm sorry, that's his fault for being there half an hour. - But I've an appointment at 9:30! And I have to be in the office at 9:00. Oh, haven't you? Well, listen... Now then, now then. Little birds in their nest. I can't think what you've been doing in there judging by the result. Excuse me. Hello, she picked you there. Losing your pep, aren't you? Dear, what love can do. Stasia? Stasia! How often have I... Oh, good morning Mr. Wright. That girl... Playing up a bit this morning? That's the result of yesterday. She began the morning by getting up late. Always the same. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile. Is that the accounts you're making up, by any change? I'll settle mine now, if you like. - Thank you, Mr. Wright. That's very kind of you. - Oh, no, not at all. I'm sure to be welcome. - That's 20 pounds. - 20 pounds... Right. I wish they were all as prompt as you are. - Nothing dud about this check. - Of course not. I wouldn't say the same about another one you're holding, though. Particularly if you're counting on me as security. Yes, 'oh' is the word. Because he'll never be able to pay you. - We'll see about that. - With a bit of luck you were able to get such a nice lot for your third floor back. I suppose he had good credentials, hmm? What? Well, anyway you won't be missing me now if I go. You're not going to leave us, are you? Well, I don't know. I don't somehow like the atmosphere the last few days. Too much of the "Kiss me, Hardy" stuff for my liking. I think I might be better out of it. - Don't say that, Mr. Wright. Well, we'll see. Hello, nosy. What's up? I heard. Did you? Well, you ought to be pleased. - Me? - Yes, if Vivian does turn me down I shall have some bits and pieces to chuck away. When are you coming up to have a look at them? Ah, when. Come in. Sorry about that bathroom. Made you a bit rushed indeed. - Certainly did. - I thought so. Give the old girl a chance. Oh, dear we are putting our feet in it this morning, aren't we? Caught his girlfriend having a dip in the rouge box. Sorry old man. Didn't know this was a case of love's young dream. See? I wasn't so far wrong, was I? What are you going to do about it? What do you expect me to do? - How about a little lecture? - Lecture them? Because they are upset? I see. Too high and mighty to interfere this morning, hey? Now, then! And what about a little service? all right, I'm not an eight handed octopus! Morning! Any mail for me? I put it on your table, Mr. Chris. No luck? - (indiscernible) - Competition worth? Yes. Why'd you waste your time with that stuff? The idea, Mr. Wright, is to make a little money. Money? There isn't any money for you in that. Not for some years anyway. You've got talent! Why don't you do something about it? - What exactly? - Do a job, make some dough. - Splendid! How? - That's easy. If you've got the guts. Sugar? Thank you. Plenty of room in the building trade for qualified men. With brains. Designing jerry-built houses I suppose. Don't talk soft. There's a thousand and one jobs you could do for me. But with all these new regulations and whatnots... You mean you can make use of my name and qualifications to cover up your dodging of the Housing Reform Act. Uh, milk? I mean I've got a contract waiting for somebody who's capable of holding down a fat job at a good screw. And that's straight enough, isn't it? Milk? It's hardly the word I should've chosen. Thank you. Would you care to have a squint at that contract? I'm sorry. I'm not your man. Well, there's no hurry. Think it over. Stasia! Hello? Anything wrong? Oh, dear I'm in a terrible state. My cameo broach is missing. - Ah, there you are, you see? Dear! You don't think it's been stolen, do you? Who do you think could've taken it? - Don't ask me. Well, you've got to expect something with all the riffraff we're getting in this place now. Stasia. Good morning, Mrs. De Hooley. Have you seen my cameo broach? - Me? - Yes, you. No, Mrs. De Hooley. I haven't set eyes... It isn’t eyes she’s afraid of, it’s fingers. You think I took it? - Someone's taken it, haven't they? - But why me? You wouldn't expect me to accuse one of the guests, would you? After all, it wouldn't be surprising considering where you come from. - What's this? What's all this noise? You're all hypocrites! All smarmy one day and telling me I'm a thief the next! Who's a thief? What is this? - I'm sick of it! - Stasia. Well, I'm no softie. But what do I want to go straight for? Better be like the rest of them. Take my chance while I’ve got it and clear out. Hear, hear... Would someone mind telling me what this is all about? - I lost my broach! -Your cameo broach? -Yes, I... - In the (indiscernible). I picked it up in the passage last night and popped it in for you. Really, I do think you should take more care of your things. One of these days you'll really lose something. Woolf, woolf, woolf! - Well. - It's all right. Just a friendly word of warning. Old Sharpe's on the warpath this morning. What do you mean? She's heard something? I don't think she's so keen on that post-dated check as she was. Not unless you find a new security. Just to warn you, you know. What's that? My lord, we were fools to quarrel with him. We? I thought it was your noble gesture. You know perfectly well that I should never have done it. If it hadn't been for you going all sentimental. So that's our little hero, is it? For goodness sake, don't sit up in bed there nagging. Oh, may I have a word with you? Yes? Yes? ...half my life (indiscernible)... What do I get for it? (indiscernible) Oh, Vivian. Listen, I want to tell you... - You see? It's no good, Chris. We can't risk it. Oh, I'm sorry. But it's true! A month ago I might have faced it. But you weren't so sure then. And now I've lost my courage. I couldn't face a life like Mother's! You mean you think I might turn out like your father? Oh, we both should without money! You said so yourself! - I never said that, Vivian. I never said, did I? Well, what is it? What are you laughing at? This is so like one of the scenes I've been listening to all my life. Oh, no. Don't be angry, Chris. Listen. Don't you see it's for your sake as much as for mine? I don't want either of us to be to be like they are. I want you to go on and do all the things that you want to do. To be a great success and a great man. I want you to build those hospitals. Which you, as a puppeteer slum landlords wife, will come and open I suppose. Now you listen to me. If you're gonna give up your ideals and everything else for the sake of comfort and safety I'm going to do the same. I had a nice little offer today from your Mr. Wright. - What? - To take over the slum property and do a little faking to get around the new Acts. Well, what you're looking so miserable about? You'll get your share of it. You can sell yourself! Why shouldn't I? Anyway, that's what I'm gonna do tonight. If I haven't put a bullet through his head before that. You know the old saying, don't you, Major? "The Lord helps them who help themselves." Don't you see the whole you're putting me into? Give that bell another push for me, will you? There's a limit to what a man in my position will swallow! Not if someone else pays. He'll be all right after he's had a couple. There you are. I want some more whiskey. Well, I don't think I ought to get it without asking Sharpe. Scared of her? Fat lot I care for her or any of them if it comes to that. That's how we're feeling, hey? That's the stuff! Stasia. Come here a sec. Did you mean what you said? What? You know. What you said about not being a softie. It depends. Come here, kid. - I'm all right where I am. - Now, come on. What's up today? Got the blues? A bit different today all of them from yesterday, hmm? A lot of hypocrites. Yes, you might have thought they were human, mightn't you? Must have had a touch of the sun or something. You know kid, one of these days you'll find out who your real friends are. Who's that? Don't forget. Later! Well, what is it? Can I speak to you? all right. Well. May I sit down? Help yourself. Thanks. Well. Mr. Wright. You have a great influence in this house. You can't say I didn't warn you. Do you get any pleasure out of spoiling their lives? Lots. And your own? Don't you worry about me. My troubles I settle for myself. What about your ambitions? A home, affects, your respect. I'm trusting to my money to buy those. - A home, perhaps. - And a wife. Perhaps. But they wouldn't satisfy you. You want to achieve, not buy. You were poor once, weren't you? Did you see that? Bread and dripping, that's the best thing I put in there for the first 12 years of my life. And not too much of that either. Do you see those? Plenty of good solid leather there, hmm? Plenty. Well, till I left school I never had a pair of boots to my name. If the charity lady ever gave me any they were popped tout suite. Everything I've got I've earned. With these. And with this. There you are. What you mean, there you are? That's what we will want to go undoing. Achieving things with this. You know perfectly well it's not you they respect, but your money. That's your unhappiness. And what's yours? I'll tell you what it is. You want to change all their natures, don't you? Oh, yes you do. Only you want them to do it for themselves. It's no good for you otherwise, is it? They'd only go back on you the moment you left them. - No. - Oh, yes they would. It'd be different if I did it, wouldn't it? You'd like me to let old Tomkin off his debts and release Vivian from her promise. And probably you'd like me to settle everyone else's affairs for him. Adopt that slavey and bring her up to be a lady. And all out of my own goodness of heart. - It would make you... - I know. It'll make me happy. Well, I don't want that kind of happiness, see? They cannot... And you... They are not strong enough. Well, go on. You help them. If you want it so much. I... I... No, you mustn't interfere. Whatever happens you must not interfere. Well, wait and see what's going to happen. And before very long, too. I've got them all... there. They'll all come crawling to me before the nights out. What do you bet? Vivian, Penny, Tomkin, and the kid. Your dear little Stasia. She'll come! What about that? You can't do this! Oh, why not? It's up to her. No one's forcing her. Anyway, it's bound to happen sooner or later. Why are you trembling? - I'm afraid. - Who for? For you. So much evil set free. It will destroy... - Who? Me? Yes. Who cares! I don't want your sympathy! Keep it for those that need it. You hear? So you decided to come. I expect it's all I have. What? What's that? Those presents you were talking about. I bet they're (indiscernible). - Well, we'll see. Come on in. Come on, what's up? Afraid? No one saw you, did they? Where is everybody? All in their kennels. I know. I know 'em all. Mr. Wright. What is it? What are you staring at? You look so queer! Aren't you well? - Nothing wrong with me! All right, we'll see 'em all out. All this lot, anyhow. Come on. Here. Help me. Oh, it's you. I thought you said... - She's here somewhere, I swear it. I heard her scream. - She must be in that room! - Let's go and see. What did I tell ya. What are you doing here? What's wrong? Another party? Why wasn't I told? Dead? How did it happen? It wasn't me! - What are you doing in here? - Yes, what? Nothing! No need to ask you what you're going to do. Oh, no you don't. I saw her creep past my room. I knew there was something wrong! Look at this! I found it on the dressing table! - The ring's gone! - Where is it? - I haven't got it! Come on! Where is it? - You better own up. I haven't got it! I haven't got the ring, Miss Vivian! - Oh, Stasia... - Now, don't sympathise with her! Out with it! How did it happen? Come on, you must know. You were in here! Where's that ring? Only one thing to be done, handle her over to the police. Yes, call the police! Not them, not them! Don't send me back! I couldn't go back there, I couldn't! You don't know what it's like! How dare you be so cruel? Can't you see you are terrifying this child out of her life? It's our duty to call the police. She is a little criminal, isn't she? She is a human being like yourselves. Are you so very much better than she? What the devil you mean? You, for instance. With your debts and your fears and your revolver in your pocket. And you, signing away your honor to a man you despise. And you, who are prepared to sell yourself. And you! who would have allowed it, and you and you! How can you hurt and torment this child? And you yourselves... - That's quite enough! She's got the ring. - And she was the only one with him. She has not got the ring. It is here. He's got the ring! Now we understand the loving interest in the little orphan. There's why he didn't want us to send for the police. Old friends I expect! We'll soon see. Stop it. Stop it! It isn't true. He didn't do it! He's good. Do you hear me? He's good. I am bad! I'm wicked if you like. You can do what you like about me. But not him. Not him! - Yes? - Mrs. Sharpe! You're wanted! The police. Are you the landlady? - Yes, this is my house. - There's been an accident. - Someone's fallen from a window. - Window? Looks as though it might be from this room here. This explains it. The gramophone man. My shoulder... But tell me, what happened? He ain't dead, is he? I swear I didn't mean to hurt him! Suddenly crumbled up, like. Must have been his heart or something. Well, his fault. Always flashing that ring around. Anybody in my shoes would've gone for it. That other fella. Ask him! He saw it. He... He just stood there. Staring at me. Face it out, he says. I wish... I haven't... Yes... Sir... Tea? That's a bright idea. It's like seeing for the first time. As if we'd always been blind. It's going to be all right now. I wonder... Do you think he'd join us? Let's go and find him. Will you come with me? It was so nice of you to come. I came because you wanted me.
