Hey, partner, where'd you get them boots? Come on down to Boot Complex with the best deals in town for all your boot needs. We got hunting boots, cowboy boots, army boots, rain boots, sports boots, motorcycle boots, and much more. - Come on. - This weekend only. Come to Boot Complex to buy a pair of select boots... - Get up, get up. - Get your fucking foot off. I'm trying. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Go to the fucking door. Get off! Fuck. Fuck. Fucking. Argh! Hurry your fucking ass, will ya? Jesus! I know you're hurt. Come on, stay with me. Stay with me. Come on. - Step away from the vehicle! - Let me see your hands! - Do it! - Let's go! Stay down there. Come on, man. Come on! Come on. Hey, friend. My associates and I would like to charter an afternoon flight. What's he doing? Where are you going? Shut up. There's not enough fuel in the tank. Get us up in the air! We're going to have to fucking stop this. This fucking hurt... One job, I have one job? Get out before I fucking call the cops! Pick up the fucking phone, Cynthia. I fucking dare you. We now bring you an update on the roll over crash at LaToya Air Park this morning. All four suspects are still on the run and are more than likely connected to the death of five Tucson police officers and the hijacking of a plane. So, what'll it be? Omelet, Swiss, green peppers, bacon, rye toast, kettle potatoes and bring on the cholula. You got it, easy rider. Ah, you can't be fucking serious. Jack, keep your voice down. I don't fucking care who hears me. I am not canceling last minute like this. Besides, I know what kind of guy this Suzie goes with and I don't want you anywhere near those scumbags. Jack. I know what you girls get up to and I've already taken time off. I... I can't undo that. Jack, I can't miss this. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you sure fucking can. Why do you always got to do this to me? It's fucking horseshit. How about not talking to the lady that way? Excuse me? How about not talking to the lady that way? I will talk however the fuck I want to talk, asshole. I'm sure you always do, but all of us out here with manners who hear you, we talked it over and we all think you're an idiot. You ready for the check, easy rider? In a way, yes. I was running third on this omelet here and here, take a peek under these eggs. Jesus! It turns my stomach. Honey, I am so sorry. I gotta go yell at someone in the back. The check, of course, is on us. Again, I am so sorry. How about a piece of pie for the road? There's a question you don't have to ask me twice. Hey! You wanna finish what you started? Friend, if it means talking to you any further, I'll have to pass. Hey, I'm talking to you. Who the fuck you think you are? Spiderman, but you caught me on my day off. Nice backpack, faggot! Look, man, how about letting me take my pie and be on my way. How does that sound? I don't like how that sounds. You shouldn't have messed with me, man. Oh, yeah, why is that? Help! Really? Are you okay? Sidewalk, asshole! Hear about the fire? Yeah, we already got our cows off that pasture yesterday, so. - Okay. Good. - So, we're clean. We're hoping it's just smoke and little fire. With our luck it will be nothing. Diehard, this one. I'm in it for the adventure. Of course, Sherriff. I got a new adventure ahead of me. Got a shitload of barbed wire in there. Four-hour drive. Alrighty then, gentlemen. You got to go see a barbed fence. See you. Good girl. Yeah. I knew that's what you needed. Come now. Come on now. Oh, my God. Might as well. Come on. Beatrice, we're a team. Great job. Step on out there, partner. All right, come on over here. Are you... do you have keys? Worst part's over, fellas. Not saying it's gonna be smooth sailing from here on out, but I'd say rattle around some little cracker box half mile off the ground is the worst part of any day. Hold on. Eungard and I are gonna head out. You stay here with, uh, what's your name, captain? Me? You're the one flying the plane. Uh, Gary. Gary. Gary Gary. All right, you stay here with Gary Gary and the dead weight. Eungard and I are gonna check out the homestead. LeDuc, these bullet holes are... are fucking filthy. He... he needs water. And I need him not to have gotten shot in the fucking face. And I need you to have driven us to safety like what a getaway driver supposed to fucking do. Eungard, let's go! Oh shit! I can't, can't. Listen, I know you got a problem with the way I handled this. I am too old for this shit, LeDuc. This is on you, mate. Oh, come on, man. I got us here alive, didn't I? All right. Okay, stay put, but, listen, cell phones for shit out here. I'm gonna scope it out and as soon as I see a landline, I'm calling Reicher in Denver. Pretty sure he's gonna want to hear about a case full of first editions and I'm fucking positive that he's got the capital. And if he's not interested, I'm calling Bentley or Slick Mick, but we got options, baby. I'm not worried about the money. Don't call Reicher first. Call Slick Mick, mate. All right, let's go. You guys have keys? Don't know whether to shoot you or thank you. On a count of three, you're gonna drop to your knees and put them hands on that bumper right in front of you. Right where I can see them. One, two, three. All right. Now, I want you to turn around, stay on your knees, and all the while I want you to keep them hands up palms out. Afternoon. I'm a stowaway. I hopped in back your pickup truck outside the supply store at Sierra Vista. I mean you no harm. I was only running from a little trouble. And... And... Why didn't you just ask for a ride? Trouble was right behind me, Ma'am. I didn't have time to ask. Now, I'm just trying to get back on the road. I did not mean to come all the way out here to your home, Ma'am. So that's why you're looking to steal my rig? I'm not looking to steal it. I just need a ride back to town. I'm happy to be on my way, Ma'am. Honest. All you got to do is point me in the right direction and I am gone. Really, I can disappear like that. I've been doing it all my life. I'm kind of an expert at it. All right, cool hand. Go ahead and stand up. Okay. You're a good guy in a bad situation. Let's say I buy it. How do we get you back to where you belong? You let me give 30 minutes TLC to your truck here, and you could take me back to town by sundown. You can even stand there and watch me the whole time if you want. Just, uh, don't shoot me. Don't worry, this gun can't hurt you. You can put your hands down. We can head back to Tucson once you fix her up, but I ain't driving. I ain't sticking around to watch you fix her neither. I've seen this plane fly over, it's over goddamn bullet. Must have touched down pretty close, less than a mile I'd say. That means it landed on my property and that means I got to do the right thing and make sure everybody's safe and all is well. Still, gotta be careful. Hey, girl. Guess I'm running my keep around here after all. Yes, Sir. She sure seems like a good old gal. Now this gun can hurt you. Tell you what, if I can't fix your truck, you can shoot me. How's that for a guarantee? I get a feeling about people. Could usually get a pretty accurate reading, five, ten minutes. Well, if I can't fix her at least she's got some pretty solid tires. Don't prove me wrong. Stay put. Get you off the ground. Come on. When LeDuc comes back out, you kill him. You kill him. No. Tommy, I can't. I can't take care of you by myself. I need him. He's going to kill us both. You have to kill him. Tommy, just breathe. Just breathe, okay? Goddamn it! Fuck! Damn it. Fuck! Get over here will you? What? You know anything about cars? Just how to drive them. Oh, yeah. You're sure about that? Oh, yeah? Well, what the fuck happened, LeDuc, huh? Nothing can go wrong. We're gonna be in and out, drinking tequila at sunset in Phoenix. Does that ring any bells? Hundred grand each by sunset. What the fuck happened? They got to Harry, must've. And how do you know that? If there were police involved, they got to him, trust me. I don't trust you, that's the thing, okay? Well, good for you. So, so what? So what? You're just gonna make some phone calls and you're gonna get us out of here, is that it? Yes. This sort of thing may not be in your wheelhouse McBride, but it is what I do. You think Harry's the only one in the business? And let's be clear, we each got a hundred grand sitting in that plane in a brown case. And I'll tell you something else, we'd each have a hundred and thirty-three grand if it was for that sack of shit. I'm not just gonna let him fucking die here, okay? Oh, come on, man. He's not gonna make it. Look at his face. And what the hell are we gonna do about it all the way out here? Fiesta en mi casa. Fuck. Ah, shit. Fuck. Office time. Here. Here. And the next thing I knew, I met Marla... To attempt the brazen daylight plane jacking. The aircraft was last seen heading south though the current whereabouts remain unknown. It is believed that this hijacking is directly connected to the theft of nearly a dozen rare books from a private collection valued at over four million dollars. Five servicemen were killed in the robbery which occurred at approximately 11:10 AM near the scene of the roll-over crash. Chief of Police Kenneth Prescott held a press conference this afternoon outlining the department's next steps. The FBI will be joining the hunt as Mr. Gary Mueller's possible kidnapping makes this a federal issue. Yeah, well Harry can go fuck himself. I know it's a tall order, but look... look what you stand to gain, you see? Yeah, I don't know, somewhere in Arizona. Well, listen. We'll be in Mexico by sundown 100%. Look, the table's set, man. You want in on this or not? I can make a call to Bentley tomorrow. We're back in business, big time. Yeah, what's that supposed to mean? We got our money and then some. Y'all just need to have a little faith in old LeDuc. He'll take care of you. Yeah, well I need to take care of him right now. I don't give a shit about the money. Aw! Get the fuck down! Fuck. Listen real good boys, I've got a scope rifle and I can get off three shots in less than two seconds. I'm going to count to three and you're going to toss them as far as you can out into the yard. One, two, three. Shit! What with all this activity today, you think I'd taken out a full-page color in the Desert Herald advertising this place as a goddamn bed-and-breakfast. Does this look like a bed-and-breakfast to you fellas? No, Ma'am. No, Ma'am, indeed. Hope you don't mind my not offering to bring out the iced tea. I mean requesting your story, the shortest, plainest, truest version of how you came to be here armed and trespassing on my land. Ma'am, my name is Raymond Fuchs and I want to offer a sincere apology for inconvenience to you like this. You see my... my friend Peter and I we... we chartered a flight to do some hunting, quail and pheasant, mostly, and wouldn't you know it, en route our plane suffered some major engine trouble and we had to do an emergency landing right over the horizon there. And on our way down we saw your house. We thought maybe there was a phone line, or some assistance to be had. Hunting pheasant and quail? Those weapons are pretty tactical for pheasant and quail. You don't say. Well, we're sort of new this thing, I mean. So, how about it, Ma'am? We laid down our arms, maybe you could do the same? I mean, the quicker we can get a hold of someone, the quicker we can be out of your hair? All right, don't shoot her. Well, the truck's fucked, but good news, you're right about Slick Mick. Put it down, lady. Just real, real slow. Good to have you back, man. Oh, I got tired of waiting. Good, heh? All right, Little House on the Prairie, what time is your husband due back? Okay, your boyfriend. Oh, I see. You're one of those liberated ladies, aren't you? Homesteading out here all by your lonesome. You don't need no man to get the job done, right? Up you go, big fella. Inside, inside. Where the hell are we? Cochise County. If it means anything to you. How close to Mexico? About 20 miles. What's the word on that truck outside? If that's plan A, you might want to consider a plan B. Look, you don't understand. I'm gonna take care of your friend there. - I'm a registered nurse. - Yeah, yeah. You're a nurse. We get that. The only problem with your logic is he is most definitely not our friend. Now, is there anyone else that lives around here? - No. - Oh yeah? What about that big old house over there? That's where I used to live when I had a family. Now, I live here. You through? Now, listen up. Get the rubbing alcohol and whiskey from under the sink. He's got a bunch of glass deep in his face. You, make him drink more water, give him Ibuprofen. And somebody boil some goddamn water. Boy scouts. Let's go outside and do a perimeter check. Let's not trust the old fucking bitch. Hmm, come on. Look man, I think she's telling the truth. When me and that McBride asshole came up, we didn't see anyone over that way or anywhere. All right, so listen. We're not getting out of doing a bloody perimeter check, mate. We got a problem. If they're looking south, they're coming right at us. And we got a 36-foot get away plane, in plain fucking sight. The South is a big place, okay? They're not gonna know exactly where we're at. - It's fucking close enough. - Okay, well that's what I'm trying to tell you. - I got a fucking solution. - Yeah? Del Rio, Texas. - What? - It's a border crossing built right on a goddamn dam. The Rio Grande River. Slick Mick was telling me all about it. Anytime he needed something brought into the U.S. that's where it went down. I'm not buying that. Well, neither do I man but it's a plan, you know, something to hang our head on. All we need to do is get our asses the last 20 miles to Mexico, tonight. What's your name? Aaron. Aaron, I need you to go wash your hands. What's wrong with him? There we go. Just a lot of pain. Okay. I've got a job for you. I need you to take this, tie the sleeves together to make a sling for his arm. What's his name? Tommy. Tommy, listen up, your brother's making a sling for your arm. I gotta clean out the wounds on your face now, it's gonna really hurt. What about the lady? We just tie her up and leave her some food. I guess we don't need to kill her. We just need a head start, mate. Gary, Gary, you're up next. He dead yet? Oh shit. You're good at it, Gary Gary. You did it. This is not a good idea. Regular unleaded gasoline is too low octane for aviation. The chances of vapor lock are too high. What does vapor lock mean? What the fuck do I know. It'll get us in the air. Hey, partner where'd you get those boots? They don't believe you. That's what they're talking about right now. They don't believe me what? None of it. Not that you don't live alone, not that no one else is coming along, nothing. Suppose y'all didn't believe me either when I said I could fix up your brother here. You... do you think he's... he's gonna die? Maybe. We'll buy him some time once I'm through here. As long as we get all this glass and buckshot out, he's gonna be just fine. You're in my light again. Those other fellas, you know them? What? Those other fellas you came here with, the older ones. You know them well? What's it... what's it to you? Nothing, I suppose. I'm just trying to make conversation. Been a while since I had to practice my bedside manner. Your what? Look, I don't know what you boys did or what you're running from, but if y'all ain't on the same page now, the immediate future don't look too bright. You think they're gonna kill him? They're bad men. I don't think they have your brother's best interests in mind. You want me to get that? All right. Stand up. Sit in the chair. - Seriously? - Sit in the chair. Please record your message. Hello there little lady. This is Sam here and Billy, you know, your partner, the one in the car with you. And that goddamn forest fire was ain't nothing more than a blaze. You could have just peed on it. Anyway, we were thinking about stopping by on our way past your spread, maybe help you out with that wire fencing, maybe take some of your money and cards, or maybe just knock back a couple of beers. We're 18. See you soon. Love you. All right, El Capitan upsie-daisy. Oh shit! Fuck me. Déjà vu, huh, Gary Gary. Feels like it's been 10 years we've been through so much together. In the hole Gary Gary, in the hole. Oh shit, "Oh shit" what? - Don't know where the keys are? - No. - Yeah. - Let me figure it out. - Gary Gary... - Give me a second. - Where are the keys? - Come out. Hey, come here. Keys, motherfucker! Got another one on deck. I must have dropped it on the way here. I swear I don't have them. What happened? Are we leaving? This piece of shit sabotaged us. He hid the goddamn keys. I didn't take the keys! Shush, shush, shush, shush. You took the keys. I didn't take them. How many times do I have to tell you? I didn't... - I'm serious. - Where are the keys? I want to get out of here as well. Where are they? Did you throw them in the field? Go find them in the trunk or find them in... I don't know where the keys are! Maybe they're in his fucking ass. I think we should check your ass, Gary. - What are you talking about? - There's no end. I put the keys in my ass, what a great idea. Wait, can't we just hot wire the fucking plane? Oh, Jesus! You don't think I asked him that? Just an idea. And what's with all this Grey's Anatomy shit? If you could do her job, why is she still breathing? I'm telling you fellas, if I don't clean his face and change the bandages on the regular, he's gonna get infected. Not much I can do at that point. Yeah, well none of that matters. We got the FBI after us. We can't hide the plane. He's shot in the fucking face and we got no way out of here. What does that leave us? We got two hostages, two witnesses. Somebody called while you guys were gone. They... they're like Park Rangers or something. They said that they're gonna come in and pay her a visit. What's he talking about? Got a couple of BLM Ranger friends stop by from time to time. When are they coming? Didn't say. It's pretty casual around here, mister. Let me ask you a question. If you had a full tank of gas, where'd you be heading? Mexico? I can get you there through the canyon. I'm real familiar with the country around here. Oh, yeah? You got some magical flying carpet? Or are we each gonna take turns dragging his ass across the fucking desert? Sounds good to me. Staying here's no good. You already know that. All right, everybody outside. - He's not done. He needs more bandages. - He's fine. Get out. - Excuse me. - Shut up. Wakey-wakey, Quasimodo. See this? - Keep an eye on two of them, all right? All right? - Yes. So, what are we gonna do? Are we... we can... carry him through the canyon? No, no. You're gonna carry him. If you wait till he gets better, he can walk. We don't have time to wait. We got to hoof it, now. He's the reason we're in this shit. Well, he's still alive, LeDuc. Yeah, I get that but not for very long. Have you seen his face lately? It's a long fucking road. I don't want to carry this fucking... - What else are we gonna do? - Fix the fucking truck. Do you know how to fix a truck? We're gonna walk into Mexico? - Why is he trying to... - What if she just walks us to the border patrol? Exactly. Okay. Camped in the desert. We just need to get through the fucking canyon and get to Mexico, no problem. - What's wrong with the truck? - Don't know. - Hey, listen... - Psst. Who the fuck is that? - Are you trying to get us somewhere? - Let's do it. What the fuck? All right, here's the news. We're taking the old lady's advice. We're gonna hoof it through the canyon. What's your name, Ma'am? Eden. Do you know the way to Mexico, Eden? Indeed, I do. Correct me if I'm wrong, Eden, but I thought I heard some cattle roaming on your property. That's right. And where there's cows, there's horses. That's right, four of them. Horses. Four of them. Okay, hold on. We're seriously discussing this. I'm sorry, mate. But do you think that's such a bad idea? Yes. Okay, well what do you suggest we do? Hijack another fucking plane? That is the best plan I've heard all day. Says who? Says the soon-to-be corpse? It's so crazy, it might just work. He's so crazy, he might be right. Yeah, okay no. I give the orders here. Your fucking orders, mate, got us here. All right? She can get us out. Four horses, right? - That's right. - Yeah. The McBride boys here can have one and there's one for each of us, right? You got keys to the house over the way? I do. Horses. Who do I ride with? Shut up. Listen, mate. Snap out of it, a way out of here is just what we fucking need. Now which of you idiots tied these fucking ropes? Take one guess. I was trying to make sure that she didn't escape. Oh, is that right? It's a fucking mess, Boy Scout. Excuse me guys, who am I gonna ride with? We're gonna hog-tie your cheeseburger ass and drag you all the way there. How does that sound? Okay, all right? You, get up. You come to McBride and make sure she doesn't fuck with the horses. Not much to it, fellas. I'm just gonna throw some saddles on them, and we'll be together. It's smart to take a look at the shoes though. Lady, you just don't get it, do you? We're in a hurry. Do the least amount you got to fucking do. Fine. How long are we talking? 20, 30 minutes. No, to Mexico. That it will be this time tomorrow. So, sundown tomorrow, we'll be drinking tequila just like I said, McBride, only Mexico, instead of Phoenix. Hell, tequila with a dirty side of Mexican snatch, crabs be damned. Hey, Eden, where can a guy get some rubbers on the way? Is there a 7/11 around here? I can't help you with that. Fuck, knock it off. Give us the keys, toots. Nothing in there. Just a house I used to live out with my daughter. Oh, fuck. Lady I'm really sorry to, you know, walk all over your nostalgia trip here, but if you don't play Paul, I'll knock the fucking door down, so give me the fucking keys, now! That's better. Fucking bitch. Twenty minutes, Dr. Quinn, and I'm holding you to that. This way. Looks like you got yourselves a plan then? Riding out on horseback into the sunset but that's something you never thought you'd actually be doing for real now, it is? I guess not. You ever ride before? No. Well, not much to it. I'll teach you everything you need to know in no time. Come on now, scoot on over. There you go. Give it a rest will ya? Horses, carriages. Who gives a shit how we get there? That giant turd can't run the show like that, man. He's going to start giving us orders. He's not giving us orders, mate. He just made a suggestion which is a pretty fucking good one. Yeah, well in my experience, you let a guy like that call a shot, he's gonna call another. Look, all I know is when we get there, we're doing what I say, when I say, and nobody fucks with that. All right? Right. And you think we're gonna make it by tonight? Of course, we will. A 20-mile ride ain't shit. Hell, I've been camping on the range 20 days stretch before. It's once we make it what concerns me. What's your plans for after? Between you and me, I don't think those other fellas know much more about it than you. We'll just take it day by day. Hour by hour, more like. Small goals. You think Tommy's gonna make it through the night? Of course, he will. As far as head injuries go, it really ain't that bad believe it or not. Once we clean his face again before nightfall, he'll be sitting pretty. Take it easy, mate. You're talking like we're already in Mexico. Yeah, well, there's a lot to do when we get there. Yeah, but let's get to Mexico first. There's still a lot to do here, too, you know. What? Are you talking about Gary Gary? I'm talking about every fucking thing. The McBride idiot with the fucking shit in his face, the nurse woman riding a horse through a desert. You ever done that? Hmm? All I'm saying is we got a lot to think about before Del Rio and the dam. And, yes, that includes the fucking pilot. Ah! Fuck. Shit. What the fuck was that? Tommy. - Yeah, I missed. Argh! - Shit. Goddamn it! Argh! Fuck. Keep your eye on that bitch in the barn! Fuck! Gary. I see you. Ooh! Ooh. Gary. Ey! Okay. Ah! Found you. Don't even try it. I'll shred you with this before you turn around in there. Now, come on. Move. Let's go. Gary, what is this? Game of charades? Ah? You, the cow, huh? Gary, I want you to moo for me. Hmm, moo! Gary, if you don't moo for me, I'm gonna brand you. There's someone else here. It's not just Eden and me. What you talking about, Gary Gary? He's hiding in the trailer. In the kitchen closet. You don't believe me, ask her. That's who took the keys from the plane. I'm through fucking around. Get your fucking ass out of there now! Goddamn it. Gary, get your... You say there's someone out there. Well, we're gonna find out. Hey Eungard, bring that woman out here. Now. Eungard, you hear me? We're going to get to the bottom of this. I'm tired of this shit. What the hell is this? Wait till you hear what this piece of shit just told me. Tell him. There's somebody here besides her. What was that? There's somebody else here, a ranch hand or somebody. - He's hiding in the kitchen. - What's he talking about? I don't know, but we're gonna find out. Hey, hey, we need her. For what? To patch up McBride piss-head number one? Please, if there's someone here, he's with her not with Gary Gary. He doesn't give a shit about Gary Gary. We need her to lead us out of here, mate. We go 20 miles that way. We don't need an atlas to get there. All right, who's ever out there, who's ever watching us, I'm calling your bluff. If you don't show yourself right now, I'm gonna put a bullet where the spine meets skull. Eungard, put 10 seconds on the clock, please. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five... Five seconds left. You better be right about this, Gary Gary, or she's gonna die for no good reason. Five, four, three, two, one. You fucking maniac! You ask before you shoot someone! Oh, yeah? We don't have time for this, friend, there's company coming. Yeah, I got eyes too, lunatic. Who is that? I think it's Billy and Sam coming to play some gin rummy like I said earlier. - What are you doing? - Let's dump her in the rig. Listen, you get behind the tower, I'll hide in the barn and when they get out, we'll gun them down. Don't kill my friends, please. I'll get rid of them. Just let us play some cards and drink a little bit. And then I'll get rid of them. We can get on the horses and be out of here in an hour. Fuck the horses, there's a truck coming down the driveway. No, no. We're not changing our minds. You wanted horses, you got them. You do that again, I'll shoot you myself. Do what you gotta do, play your little game, drink your fucking drinks, then they're gone. And put them in the house, it looks like Omaha Beach in there. And we'll be watching you. You say anything about anything, we'll gun them down. And that's on you. Come on. I'm with the kid, LeDuc, we should take the truck. Of course we're taking the truck, 100%. I told her what she wanted to hear which is what you tell a woman. Hey that's my spot. Get behind the couch. Hey, little lady, looks like you got our message in any case. Howdy boys, not many folks I'd want to see two times as many hours. You know this guy hit every pothole on the way in here. Get rolling, baby. You shut up. - Exactly. - I've been driving since I was twelve. Yeah, you could have fooled me. Hey, look what we brought. Ah, I can always count on you boys. Follow me and we shall have beer. All right. Oh! Now, I didn't mention this earlier, but I have been having a serious cockroach problem in that trailer over there. I smoked them out with some poison gas and I've been shacked up in the old house since yesterday. - Backing up, huh? - Hope you fellas don't mind. Sure, Eden. We don't mind. - Aw! - As long as you're ready to lose. Yeah back at you. Want to do some strip poker? Loosen up those buttons, baby. Okay, Billy, you mind yourself. Of course, I'm always gladder and shit to see you scoundrels, but we shouldn't be playing more than three-four hands right now. Figured that'll give us enough time to drain these bottles. Ain't no problem, little lady, if half hour's what you got, half hour's what we'll take. You needing to fix up a fence. Is that about it? That's it truly. Having a hell of a time finishing the job. All sorts of distractions. Just ain't never enough time. Never enough. Well, that's it for me boys, how about you? What's the news? We were fit to fight a fire today, but we're sorely disappointed. What does that even mean? You wanted out of control inferno. Only good forest fire, ain't no forest fire at all and that's just what we got. There ain't no real danger around here. No real threat. Oh, yeah? Why don't you tell Eden all about the Haskells? There's some action. Oh-oh. Hank and Maggie? You tell her. On our way back, figured we'd stop off by Turkey Creek given that the campsites a little once-over. Sure enough, Haskells are there, big-ass RV taking up all that space. So, I was saying to Hank, you can't be here longer than 14-day stretch. He and Maggie they just up and leave. No problem. That's it? That's your story? Hell no. No sooner they leave we realize they have been dumping their black water not ten feet from the creek bed. I guess they never got them valves fixed. Can you believe that? Dumping their greasy goddamn shit tank, basically, right where the fresh water is. Forest fire don't sound so bad after something foul as all that. Tell you what, forget about that fence, let's hit up Millie's. Sing some of the Boss at karaoke. All you've got to do is hop in your truck now. I'd love to, Sam, but that bucket's been giving me hell again. It was good enough today. Oh, you know, I know engines. All you have to do is ask. Boys, I appreciate the help, but I know how to handle myself. That's nonsense. We're here right now. Are you gonna wait for a mechanic to come all the way? Sam. It ain't necessary. Come on now. Pick up your card and let's keep playing and drinking. Come on. You can't expect me to just sit here when there's work to be done. - You're afraid of losing. - Your tools in the truck? Have another drink. Come on, now. No! Oh, shit! Eden, you okay? Wait, wait! Tom, I'm scared. Oh the fuck, I'm losing a lot of blood. I can... I can make it. I can make it. Just put me in the back seat. I can make it. Just go get a blanket and... Help me soak up the blood and I just... I can make it to the hospital. Well, there it is. Who's the deadweight now, LeDuc? It's just you and me now, Eden. Holy crap! Hmm. Follow the yellow brick road. Where is he? Don't know what you're asking. We're a package deal now, Eden. Like Hansel and Gretel following the breadcrumbs. You lead the way, Gretel. Tough. Industrious. You know there's only 22 known copies of this in the whole world. Whoever gets their hands on it will get up to three million dollars for it. Just don't seem fair what with us doing all the work and all. I don't like that. Who's going in first? I'll rock, paper, scissors you for it. Hmm, I win. Cold shoulder, after you. Go on. Think of it like this, Eden. You're the King's servant, and you're tasting the food to make sure it's not poisoned. I'm the king in that scenario. You're doing a noble service, Eden. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. Hold up. Doggone I'm forgetting my own rules. We're a package deal Eden, but you are going in first. Take that light. Classics. Turn that shit off. I had a feeling you were more of a Bob Seger kind of guy. With all due respect, Sir, kindly put your weapon down on the ground. Hmm, well, you've got me between a rock and a hard place, Sir. That's the idea. Hmm, sounds like we have a draw. Got you, you piece of shit! Okay, stranger, first things first. Ah! Who the hell are you?
