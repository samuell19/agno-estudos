DITIRAMBO WATCHES OVER US "The eye you see is not an eye because you see it;" "it is an eye because it sees you." (Antonio Machado) In a desolate world, in a city of madmen, a wolf among the wolves, a beast among the beasts, Ditirambo watches over us. TWO MINUTES EASTERN WISDOM DON'T FORGET WESTERN PHILOSOPHY HAVE BREAKFAST Some imperceptible effects of tiny causes originate unpredictable consequences. I love you Ditirambo. I have always loved you. I am in love with you. But you won't see me. You will never see me. Our love is impossible. I am locked in. Locked in! You will never see me. I love you Ditirambo. I am in love with you. I... I am in love with you. I'm in love with you. Hello, madam. Hello! Can you hear me? Mr STEPPE Steppe: an inhospitable plain. Steppe: a neighbour on the 6th floor. Baghdad hates policemen, journalists, private detectives and generally speaking anybody who searches for something, just like dogs do. What are you searching for, Mr Ditirambo? Tell me, what? A woman, through the drain. Come in. So, according to your deductions there is a woman locked in upstairs. But that's absurd, the upstairs belongs to me. It is always locked and nobody lives there, I assure you. Nobody has lived there in many years. A cigarette? Quiet, Baghdad! Nobody. Nobody! A chocolate? Nobody, I said. If you have a problem with your washbasin you'd better call a plumber. So you expected to find a woman? Nevertheless, Mr Steppe, I'd like to ask you to come with me and have a look. Don't you think it might be a little noise? An air bubble? Whatever it is... I must find some logical explanation. Don't you think so? There's no reason for you to deceive me. If somebody pays you to have a snoop round my home, my life, I'm willing to pay too to stop your silly investigation and leave me alone. I think this cheque is an adequate compensation for your services. I'm sorry, Mr Steppe, a woman needs my help and I must go. Be careful of Baghdad, Mr Ditirambo. My dog doesn't like displays of honesty. A locked in woman needs my help. She spoke to me this morning through the drain. Let me go into your balcony, madam. I will leap to an upstairs window. What did that woman tell you, Mr Ditirambo? She told me she needed my help and that she was in love with me. But you're too young to understand... how... how artificial these things of love can be. I am in love too, Mr Ditirambo, with a man I only saw once. I will never forget his face. He popped up in the middle of silence. I never saw him again. Mr Ditirambo, if that woman is in love with you you must go to her aid. I know what it means to be a woman in love without hope. Doc... tor... I love you Ditirambo. I have always loved you. I am in love with you. But you won't see me. You will never see me. Our love is impossible. I am locked in. Locked in! You will never see me. I love you Ditirambo. I am in love with you. I am in love. It's still the same. It will always be for me. Like it used to be. Why have you done it? You shouldn't have. You've behaved badly, see? I told you: don't do it. So pretty and helpless. You should have never done it. Do you understand? You've treated me badly again. You shouldn't have. You've behaved badly, see? I told you so. You couldn't do it helpless. Never! Do you understand? You've behaved badly again. Badly... badly. But it's still the same. It will always be for me. Why have you done it? You shouldn't... Who is that woman, Mr Steppe? That woman is my wife, Mr Ditirambo. You keep her confined to this flat. Why? She could never stay alive outside this flat, Mr Ditirambo. It would be more exact though to say that... that outside this place where time stands still she could never stay dead. Since that woman, my wife, is not a woman but a ghost. A ghost whose environment has been properly preserved. Kept intact at the very same point when she left it years ago on the day of her death. But you have ruined everything in your eagerness to investigate. I have another more logical hypothesis, Mr Steppe. What's a simple hypothesis compared to a real dream? What's the place of logic in space and time? I had trapped a ghost. I had it. I had it! But you've come to take it away from me. Your wife didn't die years ago, she left you. At least she tried to. Probably for another man. Who? That time... she died. Now she's trying again to leave me for you. But you don't need her. You just... just want the truth and therefore you will never accept responsibility for a lie. What will you do to her now that she belongs to you? A ghost set free is like an echo that can't reach a wall. It fades away. Mr Ditirambo, did you find the woman you were looking for? - There was no woman, madam. - I'm so sorry, Mr Ditirambo. Because, if a locked in woman had really existed, a woman in love with you... THERE IS NO FLUID If such a woman had existed you, Mr Ditirambo, would have known the meaning of the word "love". OUT OF ORDER I love you Ditirambo. I have always loved you. I am in love with you. But you won't see me. You will never see me. Our love is impossible. I am locked in. Locked in! You will never see me. I love you... Ditirambo. I am in love. You have killed my lie but haven't found your truth. There must be however some logical explanation. I've got it. I've got it! Mr Steppe, I've got it. I've got it! But behind that eye watching us somebody conceives sordid stories. In a desolate world, in a city of madmen, how helpless we would be if a wolf among the wolves, a beast among the beasts, Ditirambo didn't watch over us. END Subtitles: karaboudjan: 4kg
