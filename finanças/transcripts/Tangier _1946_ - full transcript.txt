Good evening, senor. You have a reservation for me? Your name, please? Adolfo Fernandez. Oh, yes. If you please. Robert, take the gentleman to 307. This way, senor. Excuse me, sir. You're new in Tangier, aren't you? Are we going home for two? Mhm. Oh, I thought we were out for the evening. I'm sorry, my dears, but tonight I have a very important business engagement. La petite, we blocked the gentleman's way. A thousand pardons, senor. The cause of my distraction is obvious, no? Would you like to employ a guy? I could show you where to buy a genuine Moroccan prayer rug. Cheap! Or I could be interpreter! This way, senor. Well, can I get you a pony? A camel? How about an elephant? That's what I like about Tangier. The informality of you housemaids. Suppose I'd been lying here now. Pepe, what'd she say? Look, Mr. Kenyon. This Rita is very difficult. I know a beautiful blonde you'd be crazy about. I'm not interested in any blondes. I have told you that before. Now, what about Rita? Last night, I say to her... Mr. Kenyon, the great war correspondent, would like to have supper with you after the show. Well? She threw her shoe at me. Is that all? This morning, I go to her quarters, and tell her what a great man you are in America. She threw the other shoe at me. You didn't let that stop you? No, no, I'm not discouraged. I tried again. Such a woman. She showed me stiletto this long. I don't think she wants to have supper with you. But why? That's what she said. "Why should I have supper with nobody?" Oh, so I'm a nobody, huh? Now what's her idea of somebody? For five pounds, I'll tell you who she went out riding with this afternoon. You leech. Why shall I pay you to know that? Why not? You owe me 28 pounds already. What's another 5? How would you like to learn the number one American hit song? Is it good? Good? Oh, it's so terrific I'll probably get in trouble with the state department just for teaching it to you. You know, Mr. Kenyon, you are a real friend. You're darn right. I don't let just anybody loan me money. Who'd she go with? Colonel Artiego. That popinjay? I couldn't beat his time, I'd enter a monastery. That would be very sad at your age. Senorita. As I promised, my dear, you're back in time. It was the most exciting ride, Colonel. I hope my companionship contributed something to the occasion. Of course. I learned much about military tactics. Who is she? Rita, the dancer. She entertains in the cafe. Ah. Is it possible to- - Rather difficult. One starts by sending expensive gifts. I shall be at my usual table tonight. You must be a great student of the dance. Mm. Rather a student of feminine beauty. A very pretty speech. No reward for such devotion. I shall give it every consideration, Colonel. Soon, I'm sure. Did you realize you closed the door in Colonel Artiego's face? Yes, ma'am. Colonel. Shall I... Later. May I introduce myself? Paul Kenyon, journalist with Genial Goodfellow, and your admirer. You forgot to mention... Discredited work respondent without visible means of support. Oh, so you've inquired about me, huh? Colonel Artiego mentioned it. I am not interested in you. Ah, but you will be when you know me better. Start this elevator and stop annoying me. Please, senorita. No woman is annoyed by admiration. I think I know when I'm annoyed. Shall we discuss this at supper? Say, 11 o'clock? I have an engagement. 11:30. 12. All right then, have a drink with me after you dance. We're gonna stay right here until you change your mind. Hey, give me back my elevator! I'm gonna lose my job. You see? The poor boy's gonna lose his job, and you haven't got much time. All right. I'll sit at your table for just five minutes. You'll never regret it. I'll plan a conversation as sparkling as champagne. I detest champagne. Make way for the little lady, folks! It's getting so a fella can't even turn his head around here. You haven't seen her? You're sure? Oh, nevermind, she's here. Rita, you're late. Don't scold, dear. But what happened? I could not help it. Why do you insist on playing with fire? Colonel Artiego is no man to trifle with. Artiego's a tiny flame. If he burns too brightly, I can pinch him out like that. I know all men are fools to you, but they can also be dangerous. That's what makes them interesting, Dolores. Come in. I was worried about you. Why? You were gone most of the day. It takes a long time to pump a well dry. Too long. When there's another who can reveal even more. You remember a man in Madrid by the name of Von Gleib? Yes, of course. He arrived in Tangier today. He's here to see Balazar? Perhaps. He's registered under the name of Adolfo Fernandez. Good. Dolores, you work tonight. Oh, no. No, Rita, I don't want to. What do you fear? We have done this often enough. Well... I have a premonition. Oh, ever since you've been so high, you've had premonitions. But they've never meant anything. All you have to do is dance, angel. Rita will do the rest. Be careful. I am always careful. Ramon! I hate this. Can't we go- - Now, now, now, stop worrying. This isn't going on forever. Cut it some more. Dimitri! Mr. Kenyon, I'm afraid I have no table for you. Oh, I see a few empties in there. Well, those tables are reserved for guests- - Relax, Dimitri. I just came down to have a little talk with Mike. Without money, that's all you can have. Hiya, Mike. How's the family? Bella and Cleo are fine, sir. ♪ Oh, I went to south for to see my Sal ♪ ♪ Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all the day ♪ ♪ With curly eyes and laughing hair ♪ ♪ Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all the day ♪ I see Pepe's on the hustle. The songs you taught him were a gold mine. ♪ For I'm going to Louisiana ♪ ♪ For to see my Susyanna ♪ ♪ Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all the day ♪ ♪ Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all the day ♪ ♪ Without a shirt ♪ Pepe, my pigeon. What was that? Boogie Woogie. What is Boogie Woogie? American! American? Wonderful, bravo! I have something for you. Here, for you! Boogie Woogie! Wonderful, bravo! Hello, Pepe. Just a minute, Mr. Kenyon. 1,400 francs. Who is that you were working on? Oh, that's senor Alec Rocco. A rich millionaire. What's his business? And I'm not paying for the information. Well, since you're a good customer, I'll tell you this confidential. They say he owns a munition factory. Doing a nice job of reconversion. Say, Mr. Kenyon, how'd you make out with Ms. Rita? Fine. What do you charge to serenade us tonight? Well, that's my specialty. 20 pounds. Robber. 10 pounds. Okay. 10 pounds. I was going to do it for eight. This Mr. Kenyon's something, huh, Mike? That he is, sonny. A 14 carat all-world chump. Chump? What's that? A man who steals the Colonel's Jeep. I had to get to Berlin, didn't I? Yes, but not before the whole Allied army. Have you still got the Jeep? No, I had to give it back to the Colonel. Sure he did. After the Russians arrested him, his paper fired him, and the Army took away all his credentials. And I'll make them regret that. Not hanging around Tangier, you won't. Why don't you go back to the States where you belong? I'm on the trail of a story. He means he's on the trail of a skirt. Maybe the story is wearing a skirt. Dolores. Hurry. Good evening, Colonel. No trouble, I hope? Trouble? Trouble? Of course there's no trouble. I'm Colonel Artiego of the police. You gentlemen are acquainted? No, I never saw him before. He just- - Barged in. Yes. It's an old habit of yours. This is Paul Kenyon, American newspaper man. And you are Samuel Fernandez? Wine merchant? Yes. May I see your papers? They're in my room, upstairs. Please get them. Certainly. If you'll excuse me- - Just a minute, Mr. Kenyon. I'd like to talk to you. Not so clever are hiding places mine, but much prettier. Senor. Didn't I just see you dancing in the cafe? You must be mistaken. Oh. A double. Very clever, and worthy of Balazar. Balazar. You do know him. You may go tell the swine that he can have that diamond when he has completed our bargain. Give it to me. You little cat! Is he dead? Yes. But Ramon, it doesn't merit it. You didn't need to kill him. He put his hands on you, so he's dead. He could have let us to Balazar. We'll still find Balazar. Artiego's in the cafe, come! Artiego! He might be Fernandez to you, but the last time I saw him he was a Nazi party leader in Munich. Really? His name was Von Gleib. Oh. I wonder what he's doing in Tangier. I wouldn't let it concern me too much, that's if you care to stay here. I've warned you, Mr. Kenyon, and embarrassing my government can be unwise. I think I see what you mean. And may I add the tricks? Like the one in the elevator that are embarrassing to me personally, would be even more unwise. Now I know what you mean. Good. Well, on this happy little note of mutual understanding, shall we part? But with the deepest pleasure, senor. Thank you, Colonel. Oh, good evening, Mr. Kenyon. Good evening. What's the matter with him? He's dead. Weren't they wonderful? I loved those fans. Good evening, Colonel. Senorita. You were magnificent, and much more exciting than ever. Thank you, Colonel. Huh. You lost a bangle from your bracelet. It must have come off while I was dancing. It's a trifle. I'll get you another, my dear. More suitable. You are very generous. I have a beautiful evening plan for us. Supper and a drive out to... Yes, Captain? An interruption, senorita. You will excuse me? If you hurry back. You may be sure. What is it, Dimitri? Murder. This way, Colonel. Yes. Behind the bed. Can you describe the man who was in here? Oh, yes. It was Mr. Kenyon, the American. His room is right next door. Oh, Mr. Kenyon. This one? Yes, Colonel. Captain? Yes, sir. Have you seen the American? Yes, he just came out of there, went down the hall. I knew it. I just knew it. I had a feeling something was going to happen. But you and Ramon, you pay no attention to me. You treat me as if I were a child. There was nothing we could do about it. We could have stopped all this. What we have to do, we have to do. That was settled for us a long time ago, and you know it. Where are you going? To find Ramon. I must help him. You must remain here. Ramon doesn't need any help. But it's murder, Rita. They might hang him. Hush. Nothing will happen to him, if we keep our wits. Maybe we could go away. There's still time. Yes, and we might as well sign a confession. What are you, a coward? Yes, where Ramon's concerned. Pardon me, I haven't much time. Did you lose this? It's your bangle. Just a moment. Oh, yes. It's from my bracelet. It must have come off while I was dancing. Thank you. Oh, not so fast. I'd like to talk to you about it. Sorry, we'll have to search your dressing room. Very well. Take over, Captain. Yes, sir. My apologies, senorita, for intruding. Why did you come down here? I had a date with Ms. Rita. You're under arrest. You're off the beam, Colonel, I didn't kill him. You were seen in Fernandez' room. Sure, but the guy was dead when I got there. A valuable object was stolen from the murdered man. What's this? Oh, that's my bangle. Where did you get it? I found it. Remember? I told you I lost it while I was dancing. That's right. She lost it while she was dancing. But you didn't find it while I was sitting with you. No, while I was with Fernandez. Unfortunately, he can't verify that. Yes, unfortunately. There seems to be an element of confusion here. Oh, that's silly. The young lady has a perfect alibi. She was dancing when the murder occurred. Yes, but you weren't. He was here, with me. I think we had all better get down to my office and discuss this further. I regret it, of course, but at least, senorita, while performing a disagreeable duty, I shall have the pleasure of your company. Thank you, Colonel. Will you allow me to change to something more suitable? Of course. I shall be waiting outside. And you, senor? You'll join me? Oh, and you, Mr. Kenyon. Mm, thank you, Colonel. I was beginning to feel neglected. Dolores? What shall we do? Give me my black dress. The new one? Yes, it's important. Nothing in his room, sir. When the senorita is ready, search her room. Thoroughly. Yes, sir. Hey, chaps! That was amusing, Colonel. Sergeant, you will take this lady to the ladies' room, and have this gentleman searched. Yes, sir. Senorita, my office. Thank you, Colonel. Oh, I almost forgotten you. That's my trouble, Colonel. No personality. Sergeant, will you entertain Mr. Kenyon? Yes, sir. Watch yourself, baby. I don't see any good conduct medals. This way, please. You see? Police station isn't so bad. No, especially the Colonel's office. This is your office, isn't it? Occasionally. If one must live in Tangier, it helps relieve the monotony to have a few conveniences. Such as a uniform star? And an electric icebox. Would you care for some caviar? Anchovies? Antipasto? Why, Colonel. I had this for dinner in every cafe. In the evening, you promised. You wouldn't have been disappointed if murder hadn't intruded. Will you settle for a drink? Temporarily. I believe that 50% of a man's happiness depends on good food... And drink. Very interesting. But you're supposed to ask about the other 50%. All right, Colonel. What about it? That is symbolized by you. Meaning? Beauty, of course. Lovely painting, a beautiful woman. These do much to help us forget the ugly things in life. Do you like beautiful things? I'm afraid I know very little about paintings. Women seldom do. Their taste runs more to furs, and jewels. It happens that a valuable diamond was stolen tonight from Senor Fernandez. A diamond? Mm. It would be most difficult for the person on whom this jewel is found. Why, Colonel. A police lecture at this time? Sorry, senorita. To the most beautiful woman in Tangier. Thank you. Yes? We searched the man and woman, sir. What did you find? Nothing, sir. Have the maid come in. Yes, sir. I'm in a very awkward position. Really? Whatever my other faults, I try to be a good officer. Would you do me a great favor? How could I refuse? Permit yourself to be searched, in the matron's quarters. Naturally. This could be avoided... If you happen to know where I might find the diamond. But Colonel... You seem to forget that I was dancing at the time of the murder. Ah, yes. Come in. You sent for me, sir? Yes. The senorita has very kindly consented to be searched. You will take care of the formality? Yes, sir. Will you keep this for me? Forever. Follow me, please. Patron! Yes, Captain? I searched her dressing room from top to bottom, also Kenyon's room, but there was no diamond. What did you find? Something very unromantic, sir. And what is that? A wig. With these beautiful women, you never know. Oh, she doesn't wear a wig. But sir, if you recall the dance, remember she had her hairdo way up and... And the sequins. Yes, that's right. And I found it in her dressing room. Well, I know she doesn't wear a wig. Why, I remember... Nah, I don't believe it. Stop lying. Confess! We know you killed him. Go ahead, boys. Have your fun. Talk! We want the truth. Stop it. Get out. All of you. Hiya, Colonel. I abhor brutality, Mr. Kenyon. Fortunately, they beat you where it doesn't show. I don't see anything fortunate about a beating whether it shows or whether it doesn't. Thanks. I've been very patient with you, considering the trouble you've caused me. Trouble I've caused you? That's a laugh. We'll skip your advances to our charming friend, that's a personal matter. But this murder may have repercussions. Senor Fernandez was a very important man. Von Gleib. Very well then, Von Gleib. Suppose you also know he came here to arrange for the escape of a high Nazi official. Through the mystery man, Balazar? Ah, you know about Balazar. Perhaps you can tell me then what became of the diamond in Von Gleib's shaving soap. Diamond? What are you talking about? He carried a very valuable diamond to pay for the escape of this Nazi. How do you know? I too have methods. You may not have killed him, but I'm certain you know where the diamond is. You're all wrong, Colonel. I don't know anything about it. Look, I'm in Tangier trying to get the story of Balazar, because that story will get my job back. I'm sorry. You'll have to figure out another way to redeem yourself with your former employer. Yeah? Why? Because I'm putting you on a plane for Lisbon tomorrow night. Oh, thank you, Colonel. That gives me just 24 hours. Precisely. If during that time you should locate the diamond for me, I might help you extend your stay until you have the full story, with pictures. Maybe I'll find the diamond, keep it, and retire. To an early grave? Colonel, I- - Clumsy fool. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, the beating shows now, doesn't it, Colonel? I'm afraid so. Goodnight, Mr. Kenyon. I'm free? As a burden. Yeah. A clay pigeon. Captain Cartiaz? Yes, sir? You're an idiot. Yes, sir. Mr. Kenyon leave? - Yes, sir. - Follow him. I wanna know where he goes and what he does. Yes, sir. - Colonel. - Yes? What I wanted to tell you... We searched the dancer, but didn't find the diamond. Did you release the others? Yes, sir. Have the senorita come to my office. Yes, Colonel. After she's been here a few moments, you come in. And inform me that the American has confessed. Oh, I comprehend, Colonel. You think that they are in this together, and that she will turn on him. Colonel, your strategy is most clever. It's far from clever, but it's the best I can think of at the moment. Yoo-hoo, soldier boy. Flirt. Thank you, matron. Oh, what a going over. Senorita, I hope you'll forgive me. A policeman's lot is not a happy one. We must all do our duty as we see it. You're magnanimous as well as beautiful. Is it any wonder I'm your captive? You're confused on our roles, Colonel. Is this mine? Why, yes. I'll get you a refreshment. The ice is melting. The ice. I like it as we left it. Is something wrong? Wrong? No. Just admiring your hair. Yes. The maid already did very well, don't you think? The matron did? Yes. I could hide a thousand diamonds in my hair. Yes, that's right. You could. Yes? Come in. What is it? Good news, Colonel. The American just told us where he hid the diamond. You will excuse me? Certainly. Whisper something to me. You don't say? That's splendid. That's excellent. I'll talk to Mr. Kenyon later. Release the woman and the dancer. Yes, sir. Of course you heard. Paul Kenyon confessed. No! Now that it's settled, we can relax. To the eternal conflict. Oh, I'm sorry, may I? Do you mind? It's been a difficult evening. But our plans for supper and- - Tomorrow, perhaps. Senorita, tomorrow never comes. That's why tomorrow is so intriguing. My chauffer will drive you. Thank you. Oh, hello. Forgive me for disturbing you. You disturb me when I'm awake. Now that you are awake, do you mind leaving? No, no, we had a date. Oh, yes. For five minutes. And you slept through it. And I slept through that? Examine my head. Do you see a soft spot up there? No, but there is a bruise in your eye. What happened? Believe it or not, I ran into a door. How did you make out? Colonel Artiego was charming. I was there, oh, about an hour. Then he sent me home in his car. Of course, that was after he told me that you confessed to stealing a diamond from the dead man. But you and I know better, don't we? Do we? Sure. Your bangle. I found it in the dead man's hand. But you told Artiego... We don't want Artiego to know everything. You are protecting me. Why? We had a date. Remember? What's that? If it's what I think it is, it's another 10 pounds I owe Pepe. ♪ Guitars in moonlight ♪ ♪ Are calling sweetly ♪ ♪ Romance is waiting ♪ ♪ Love me tonight ♪ ♪ This magic moment ♪ ♪ Is ours completely ♪ ♪ And so, my darling ♪ ♪ Love me tonight ♪ ♪ My arms are aching ♪ ♪ My lips imploring ♪ ♪ My eyes adoring ♪ ♪ Every aching love ♪ ♪ Be mine forever ♪ ♪ Through joy and sorrow ♪ ♪ There's no tomorrow ♪ ♪ Love me tonight ♪ ♪ Be mine forever ♪ ♪ Through joy and sorrow ♪ ♪ There's no tomorrow ♪ ♪ Love me tonight ♪ ♪ Love me tonight ♪ Thanks, Pepe. You're welcome, Mr. Kenyon. Goodnight. Goodnight. Come on, boys. It was lovely. Yes, wasn't it? Kinda got me too. Did you teach that to Pepe? Yes, it's a Spanish song I used to hear in Madrid. It was a little cafe just off the plaza on the left hand side, going down to La Puerta del Sol on the... Oh, you know that street. What's the name of it? Sorry. I don't know anything about Madrid. You don't, huh? That's funny, I thought that's where you were from. I am from Tenerife, in the Canary Islands. Every Spaniard should have gone to Madrid at least once before the war. It's one of those rare places that had personality and beauty. I remember in the afternoons how the sun used to shine down yellow as butter on the plaza, and the old brick buildings around Toledo Square. And the cafes full of people and gay. I used to order tall, red drinks and spend the afternoons under green striped awnings listening to the matadors with their funny cues brag about the bulls they'd killed. The flower women would come by with their baskets loaded with blossoms. And on Sunday mornings in the plaza- - The people on their way to the churches. The little girl, dress all starch and clean, going with their mamas to- - How did you know about it? I have heard. That was a swell town, all right. Till the fascists started dropping bombs on it. I was there the Christmas Eve they worked over the cathedral. They had knocked out one whole side of it, but the people in the church never left. Candles were lit for midnight mass. I think it was the only light in the whole city, for Madrid was in darkness that night. It was ghostly quiet, till from the belfry, the chimes rang out. You could hear them everywhere. We knew it was Christmas. You are cruel. How so? Madrid can mean nothing to you. I lied. It is my home. I was born there. I was there that Christmas, in a little room, praying. Why did you take the diamond? I need it. I hope it will lead me to a man named Balazar. Balazar? For six years, he has been like a shadow over my life. In Madrid, he was the leader of the Fifth Column. My father, my two brothers died at his hands, slowly. A hundred times he escaped the traps we'd set. Perhaps it was because no one knew what he looked like. Maybe this time we'll find him. And if you do find him? I can kill him. You must not be found here. Why not? In the bedroom, please. Well, who is it? Close the doors. Ramon. Where is he? I saw you with him on the balcony. So you were spying on me. Only to guard you. Why is he here? He found the bangle of my bracelet, and from Gleib's hand. Don't. I say yes. The police beat him, yet he told them nothing. He's our friend. A newspaper man looking for a story. We have no friends. Ramon. Do you have to behave this way? Can I help the way I feel, Rita? You're in love with him. I'm in love with no one. Then get rid of him. Yes, yes, I will. If you'll only leave me alone with him. Now, please go. Please, Ramon. I'll be in the hall. Yes, of course. Tough spot, huh? You are a friend, aren't you? I'm your friend. I'm going to miss you. You're leaving Tangier? So Artiego tells me. Tomorrow night on a plane. Then this is goodbye. Not quite. Just in case anyone shows up to claim the diamond, I'm sticking around to keep an eye on it, and on you. But you can't stay here. Why not? That couch out there looks very comfortable. Good night. Good night. Yes? Aren't you going to lock it? No. Good night. Good night. Who's that? It's me, Pepe, and Mike. Oh. Oh. Come in, but be quiet. What's all this? Your clothes. Your breakfast. Oh, thanks fellas. That's great. A man can't get married in an empty stomach. Married? Did he tell you I was- - He got me up at day break to tell me. I gave him my number one serenade, so naturally I- - Well this time it missed. I spent the night on that couch guarding Rita. Ramon was guarding me. By the way, what happened to him? He was going out as we were coming in. Oh. Coffee? No, thanks. I was so worried last night, I came here to wait for you. I'm sorry, I was detained. By her? Ramon. Do you remember the first time we met? Yeah, sure. I was standing outside the ruins of my father's house, crying. And you came along and put your arm around me and said, "We should go away." Your father was my friend. It's my duty to take care of you. And you've never neglected that duty. Do you think I'm cold or ugly? No. But you've never looked at me like a man looks at a woman. Last night when you didn't come back, I got so frightened. I tormented myself with pictures of you hurt or beaten. Then I think I knew where you were. Ramon, can't you see? It's not that I can't see. It's just that I can't tell my heart where to love. At least it wasn't as you imagined. I only made a fool of myself trying to protect her. Well, you are a fool! She isn't the one who needs protection, it's you. Oh, be quiet. I won't be quiet. I hate her for what she can do to you. Around her you're so weak, you tremble. She just crooks her finger at you and you crawl. I can't stand it, Ramon. I cannot stand it! Nor can [! Oh. I beg your pardon, but isn't this Senor Ramon's apartment? Yes, but he isn't here. Oh, I see. And you are? Doesn't matter. What do you want? I want to ask him a few questions. Perhaps you can help me. Please, go away. As you wish. But last night at the Ritz Hotel, a man was murdered, a valuable jewel was stolen. I know that Ramon was- - Ramon had nothing to do with it. He was dancing. I was in the cafe. He was not on the floor when the man was murdered. However, senorita, I care nothing about the man or his death. The missing gem, that concerns me. Well, Ramon doesn't have it. The police let him go, now get out of here. And if Ramon hasn't the diamond, who has? - Rita? - No! Yes. Why not Rita? That would explain many things. I trailed into her apartment, he spent the night there. Oh, I know. I know that. Oh, I see. You're in love with him. Believe me, senorita. You're protecting people who care nothing about you. Ramon killed that man, stole the diamond and gave it to Rita. No, he didn't give it to her. Rita stole the diamond. She's the one who has it now. Thank you, senorita. Somehow out here in the daylight with the sun streaming down, everything that happened last night seems so unreal. It was real enough. And so is Balazar. You probably never heard of a wise old man named Benjamin Franklin. Oh, yes. He flew a kite. Yes, he flew a kite. He also knew a great deal about people and life. He once wrote... "Vessels large may venture more, but little boats should stay near shore." So, you think I'm a little boat? I know Balazar is a big one. Still, I have heard of big battleships that were sunk by little submarines. Now look Rita, I've been around a lot more than- Excuse me. No one there. "If you wish to dispose of the diamond, visit the marketplace in the Navy port this afternoon." Quite a crowd. Yes, it's Mouloud, a holiday. Oh, I see. Well, what do we do now? Wait for Balazar to contact me. We'll pretend we are sightseers. On our honeymoon. Oh, I like this one. She likes this one. Isn't it rather vulgar? . Gracias, senor, gracias. For you. Muchos gracias. No message? No. This is the one I want. That's the one she wants. Daddy, buy this for me. Muchos gracias, senor. Is that all? Si, senorita. Madam! There is one seat left. You ever ridden a Ferris wheel? Only when I was a child. Let's take a ride. Good. Senorita. - Oh. - Kenyon. Enjoying the sights? We were, up till now. Would you think me rude if I asked to speak to the senorita alone? I would. Please, Paul. Excuse us a moment. If you put it that way. Tarnish. Senorita. You and I must have a serious talk. About what? The diamond. You found it? I expect to very soon. The Allied forces have ordered Spain out of Tangier. I'm getting ready for a long vacation. It would make me very happy if you would accompany me. You flatter me, Colonel. And you accept? I'll think it over. I'll expect my answer tonight, in the cafe. Till tonight. Hi, I'm sorry. You finally get rid of him? Yes. Of course, coming down here to answer that note, you admitted you had the diamond. I realize that. Let's forget about him, have some fun. Senorita, senor. Will you learn the secrets of the fates? For a few small coins, senorita, you may find what the future holds for you, or to be rid of your enemies. Why not? Do you believe in that stuff? Who knows? He's the Hajji. One of those who have made the pilgrimage to Mecca. They say he can foretell the future. Well, let's see what we drew. I can't figure out that gibberish. He says live for today. Tomorrow, you may be dead. Pretty good advice. What do you say we put it to work? Thanks, pal. All right then, try this one. The big black bug bled bad blood on the big barn floor. Big black bug beg... Oh! Say chocolate. Chocolate. I'll settle for that. Balazar! Did he get it? No, he didn't. I almost wish he had. Why do you say that? I'm getting cold feet. Are you afraid? Last night I came here to get that diamond. I didn't care how. Yes, I know. You meant a story and a job. Yeah. And now suddenly nothing matters to me but you. Nothing can matter to me but Balazar. Look, honey, the whole world's out to smash people like Balazar. I'm taking you with me tonight on that plane to Lisbon. It is impossible. I cannot leave Tangier. I'll fix that. I'll make a deal without Artiego. He gets the diamond if you can leave with me. Now, what do you say? If fate wills it, I will go. Look, baby, I'm asking you, not fate. ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ ♪ She'll be steaming and a puffing ♪ ♪ Oh Lord she won't stop for nothing ♪ ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ ♪ Oh, we all go out to meet her when she comes ♪ ♪ Buh-buh-buh-buh ♪ ♪ Oh, we all go out to meet her when she comes ♪ ♪ Buh-buh-buh-buh ♪ ♪ We will kill the old red rooster ♪ ♪ Kill the tired old red rooster ♪ ♪ And we all have chicken dumpling when she comes ♪ ♪ Oh buh-buh-oh ♪ What was that? American. Number one on the Hit Procession. On the what? The Hit Procession. Where did you learn it? Mr. Kenyon taught me. Oh, yes. Mr. Kenyon. Where is he? With Ms. Rita. Where have you been? Having the most wonderful afternoon of my life. With the American? Yes. Oh, you're here. I was going to go on in your place. Good. That's what I came to tell you. I have something else to do. Well, what is it this time? Rita, I'm getting sick and tired of pretending that I'm you. For six years, I've danced, and they've applauded you. For six years, I've danced, and they fall in love with you. If I go out there tonight, I'm not going to wear that wig. After tonight, Dolores, you can dance for yourself. You can have the applause. I don't understand. I am going to meet Balazar. Balazar? Yes. And then I am going away with Paul. Paul Kenyon? You love him? Yes, I do. Here you are, Mike. 1,100 pesetas. Wait a minute. I'll take that. Drinks for the house, on me. You mean on me? Yes, Pepe, you were right. You mean about my serenade? Rita and I are gonna be married. You see, Mike? It is fatal! Yippee! Congratulations, I didn't think you could do it. Yes, sir. I chased her till she caught me. Ah, Ramon. Can you see it on my face? What? Because of my songs, Rita has fallen in love. What are you saying? This lovely lady was not interested in men, but she's to marry Mr. Kenyon. You're lying! What's wrong with you? Good luck, Paul. Rita! Be careful now, promise. Yes. Wait. Put this garter on. Why? The diamond is in it. Oh, no, I'd rather not, Rita. All right. Look then, I will hide it in here. If anything happens, they'll fall on their face. - Yes, but- - Please, your cue! Good evening, senorita. Oh, Senor Rocco. You're early. I was about to feed my little friend. Please, sit down. No, thank you. Will you excuse me? They like to be fed on time. Especially these little fellows. Pterophyllum scalare. Angelfish. I have some beauties here. Wouldn't you care to look at them? No. As you wish. You're here about the diamond, of course. I'm here in answer to a note. Oh yes, the note. I'm prepared to offer a handsome reward. Are you interested? Very. 1,000 pounds, no questions asked. Does that sound fair? Too fair for Balazar. I don't understand. My brothers were tortured for three days until they died. My father was hanged by the thumbs, until he too was dead. I'm sorry, senorita. But how does that concern me? The man who did this was called Balazar. Now, do you understand? Well, perhaps but- - It has taken me a long time to find you! Have Captain Cartiaz join me. Yes, Colonel. Rita. Rita! What happened to Rita? Where is she? Yes, where is she? - I don't know. - Where is she? She's going to meet Balazar. Balazar? She got her note from the fortune teller. Why, I've got that note, it's some silly thing about tomorrow. Well, where is it? It's in Arabic. Maybe I can read it. "Come alone, Ritz Hotel, apartment on the roof, 10 o'clock. But she told me that... Senor! Colonel Artiego. Rita and Ramon are in trouble, you've got to help me. Of course. Senorita! Senorita! It's too quiet. I didn't see anyone. Shall we break it in? In the living room. Frankly, I find myself in a dilemma. I hadn't counted on the presence of you two belligerent gentlemen, but since you blended in and you're still alive thanks to Carlos' restraint, I just don't know what to do with you. Now, perhaps if I... Ramon. Colonel Artiego! Hold it, Rocco. Carlos! Thank you, Mr. Kenyon. That's alright, Colonel. This is the first time I've been glad to see you. I can see that. Senorita, no, no. But he has my gun. Captain Cartiaz. He has the senorita's gun. That's why I fired. He reached for it. Toss it over. You fool. That's Balazar. What? Do I know you? You did, in Spain. But I got away. May I congratulate you. Now I represent the Allied Commission for the recovery of Nazi loot. Which brings us around to the diamond. Where is it? To think I could have killed you a thousand times. Easy, baby. Yes, let's all be calm. You can understand my position. Tonight, Balazar will vanish. In time, a wealthy retired gentleman will make his appearance in another part of the world to settle down and live out his remaining days in peace, comfort and contentment. Not quite the way the storybooks have it, but the world is often like that. And the diamond is to pay for all this? Precisely. Why, you pig! No! Ramon! Ramon! An improvement, Balazar. You kill more quickly. I have less time. Your hurry won't save you, Balazar. The dead behind you are catching up. Spain is closed. All Europe is closed. You will never know any safety. I think I shall. Captain Cartiaz. Do you think you can persuade the senorita to tell us what we want to know? It'll be a pleasure. Don't touch her. Please, Mr. Kenyon. No heroics. Wait! It's my fault that we're all here. That Ramon is dead. Colonel Artiego. If you will give me your word that my friends will go free, I'll show you where the diamond is. Don't do it, Dolores. How can you trust that man? Don't believe him, senorita. I must believe him. You have my word. Give me the diamond and your friends go free. Come with me. Take over, Captain. Mr. Kenyon. Get over there. You too. Senorita. Under the drab things you usually wear, you've been concealing a great beauty. Thank you. Your mistress no doubt designed those atrocities. Looking at you now, I can understand her motive. You flatter me, Colonel Artiego. What do you gut there? An American dollar. There's plenty more where it came from if you'll drop that gun. Sorry. I'm just taking orders. They are trying hundreds of men like you all over the world for taking the wrong kind of orders. Don't be a sucker. The Colonel will run out on you. The Allies are moving in. You'll be a dead duck. Let us go. I'll testify for you. And I'll do what I can. Come on, Captain. What do you say? Carlos, watch him. Let's get out of here. In this new life I've planned, there's a place for a beautiful woman. Would you care to go with me? I intend to, Colonel. Are you out of your mind? Let go of it! They stole my elevator! Hold it! Let go of it! They're gonna crash! Please, senorita. Don't go over there. Dolores? I'm sorry. Senor Kenyon. Yes? I have orders to put you on the plane for Lisbon. That won't be necessary now. Take him along. Hold on, you idiots. Don't you know what's happened? Get him out! Look, I can't go yet, I gotta talk to someone. Mike! Pepe! Mike! Your plane, senor. I can't leave till she gets here. You should've let me talk to her at the hotel. Sorry. Orders. Mr. Kenyon! Mr. Kenyon! Mr. Kenyon, made it! I'll send you your money. You don't need to. I'll be with you. With me? But I'm going to America. That's okay, I'll go along and join a hillbilly band. Now, look, Pepe. Rita! Paul! I tried to get word to you, but they wouldn't let me. Yes, I know. Mike told me. - I am going with you. - Good. The plane is sold out. Oh. Wait a minute, wasn't that a ticket you were waving around? Yes. Pardon me, senorita, but the diamond. Pepe, give me that guitar. You want to play? I can get more out of it than you can. Here. How long has that been in there? Thank you, senorita. You have a reward coming to you. I do not wish a reward. Wait a minute. Reward Pepe with a hundred pounds and we'll call it even. Senor, the plane is ready. Come on, baby. Bye-bye. - Goodbye, Paul. - Goodbye, Paul. Goodbye, Ms. Rita. What's the matter with you? You've got your money, haven't you? I know, but... But what? Who's going to teach me any new songs?
