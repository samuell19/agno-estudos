It's getting late, Officer. Sheriff, you gotta get down here. We got an ID on her? No, Sir. No relation to Paul and Carol. Who's she? Well, for now, she's a Jane Doe. You got something? Nothing was stolen. Not a scratch on the outside of the house either. Doesn't look like someone broke in. To me, it looks like they were trying to break out. " I hit the floor around 4:47 with the mornin' blues " " Cryin' like a puppy dog " " It takes some time to come out " " Face the music gotta pay your dues " " You're the only one I want" " Best time tonight then I'm gonna cry " " Gotta put this right " " I've been dyin' " " Girl I just ain't been feelin' right" " Yes I'm in trouble I know it" " You shot me down burnin' like a heart attack " " All over you yeah " " My brown-eyed girl " " I guess I swear her hair was " " I guess I swear her hair was midnight black " " Midnight black Oh yeah " " Midnight black Oh yeah "" Cause of death? How about we skip this part tonight? Come on, this one's a soft ball.
