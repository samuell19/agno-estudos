* Row, row, row your boat * Gently down the stream * Merrily, merrily, merrily Merrily, life is but a dream * * Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream * * And if you see a crocodile Go ahead and scream * I have to look for work. No. No? But if I don't get a job, we won't get our own place. Then we can sing, "Merrily, merrily," all day every day and play Train Man. No, Train Man now. Choo-choo-choo. Here we go. Go. I'm gonna be the rotten egg. Ah, you won. Mom. Mom, I've got to go, come on. Come here, baby boy. Come to Grandma. If he's playing in the yard, can you watch him? And put him down for a nap. He'll be a grumpy monster otherwise all day. Enough. I took care of you, and you didn't get eaten by tigers, did you? You really wanna get into that right now? If you want a job, you better get moving. Joey, guess what. When I get back today, I'm gonna have a job. Guess who's gonna bring you the biggest present ever. Me. Yeah. Here you go. Okay. I hope you don't mind, but I've never worked at a laundromat before. I think you'd do good here. Oh, yes, that's awesome. Just one more blank to fill in, the year you graduated high school. Yeah. Well, I wanted to finish high school but I didn't have nobody to watch my kid. But I swear to you, if you hire me, you won't be sorry. Oh, honey. I wish I could. I'm sorry. Okay. Where's my mom? She's supposed to be watching him. What are you playing with? My goodness! Come here, baby. Carlos, no. Let go of my mommy. You little bastard! Dr. Johnson. Ms. Knight, may I speak with you? Yeah. The injuries your son suffered are consistent with abuse. No, no, no. I told the doctor, he fell off the slide today. Michelle, until we know that you can provide a safer environment I'm going to have to recommend-- Please, don't take my son. Please. Michelle. You don't understand. He's... He's so sensitive. He's... He needs me. Like, he'll be crushed. Please. Please don't take my baby. You can't just take someone's baby from them. It's not right. Hey, Michelle. You see Joey today? Yeah, he's so amazing. When's he gonna be home? They said now that I'm out of my mom's house living with my cousin, social worker said two weeks. Whoa, two weeks? Mm-hm. My hearing's on Tuesday. I've been putting in millions of applications. And I already got three of them that called me back. Wow. I know. It's my dad. Listen to what a goofball he is. Hey. You ready to go? Because I'm heading down 45th, fixing to pick you up. I'm on the porch. I'll see you in a second, mija. Wow. A dad that's still around, huh? What a concept. We're not, like, that perfect family. All right. I'll see you. Good luck at your court hearing. Okay, bye. Hello. - It's me. You almost here? I'm not gonna make it. What? Well, I'm sorry. I just lost track of the time. You lost track of the time? If I don't get to court on time, they'll report me. It's only 11:00. You have till 2. I'll just get myself there. But honey-- Hi. I'm just looking for the scarves. - Right back in the corner. - Bandannas. Excuse me. Hi. Do you know where 2950 Bridge Avenue is? I have no idea. Okay. Sorry. I know where it is. You know-- Wait, I know you. Emily's dad. I live right near to her mom. You know where this address is? Uh-huh. It's a 45-minute walk from here, at least. Forty-five minutes? Oh, man. I only have 30 minutes to get to my kid. He's in foster care and I have meetings with the social workers. If I don't get there soon, I'll lose him for longer. I can give you a ride. I can have you there like in 10 minutes. Really? Mm-hm. After your appointment, I can take you and Emily to the mall. And I've got really cold AC in my truck. In fact, it's so cold, that's my initials. A.C. Ariel Castro. Oh. Okay. Come on. Oh. It looks like you live in here. I'm a bachelor. I just had a great idea. Does your little boy like puppies? Yeah, he loves all types of animals. My dog just had puppies, and there's a few left in the litter. Think of his little face when he sees a cute little puppy. It'll only take a half a minute, and I'll still get you there early, I swear. Oh, no, no, no, I can't be late for this appointment. I'm sorry. Hey, no worries. I will get you to your social workers with time to spare. Okay, all right. Sorry, it wouldn't open from the inside. Oh, I have to fix that. Oh. Oh, is that her? She's so cool. It's Maxine. Is she friendly? Yeah. She's a beauty, huh? Yeah. Hi. Hi, pretty. Why isn't she upstairs with her babies? Oh, even mamas need a break every once in a while. You gotta see the puppies. Little, little babies. Okay. Um, can we be really quick? Yeah. Hi. The bachelor's life. I don't really get a chance to clean up much. You have a lot of stuff here. Uh, the puppies are up here. I don't want to bring them down. They'll go running around loose and then they'll get out. Okay. This way. There's Emily. Oh, that's a cute picture. Through here. In the pink room. They're probably snoozing right now. But that's when they're the cutest, when they're all snuggled up together. Where are they? No, please don't hurt me. Listen, listen. Don't move. What are you doing? I have to go pick up my son! Please! I have to go! I have to go! I have to go! I won't tell you again. You don't move. Why are you doing this to me? You don't understand. Shut up. I'm gonna be so late. Ow! I gotta get-- Why? I wasn't planning to kill you. But if you don't shut up, that could change. Please. No. You're only gonna be here for a little while. So I just want us to be friends. My bitch wife, she took my kids away. Oh. I just want someone to be here for me. I need you. Oh. What's this? How old are you? I'm 21. Jeez. I thought you were 15. Hey. What a cute kid. No, please, that's my only one. Please. No. Shut up. Oh, please. You-- Oh! Ow! Shut up. Our Father, who art in heaven... You stop making noise. You stop making noise. ...your will be done on earth as it is in-- Just so you know in case you think that these ropes and these locks, that it's not enough. Huh?

Help me. Help me. Help me. In here. In here. Help me. Please help me. Hola, Ariel. Afternoon, Mario. Is this the first time she hasn't come home? No, but she wouldn't miss her appointment at Social Services unless there was something wrong. Any chance this is all just too much for her and she just simply took off? Just give us a call if you hear from her, all right? Have a good day, ma'am. Hey, hey. I got you my favorite. See? Unh. Come on. Hey. No, I-- Okay, you're gonna be hungry. Will you please let me go? Come on, get up. Come on. Oh! No. Please, please, please. Unh! No. Please. If you let me go, I won't say anything. You shut up. This is payment for your services. Huh? I'm gonna keep it in here. * Gently down the stream * Merrily, merrily, merrily Merrily, life is but a dream * My daughter Emily said... everybody thinks that you freaked out and you took off. You abandoned your little boy. You. There's no posters on poles. No, uh... no search parties. Do you know what that means? Hey. I can do whatever I want with you. I'm all you got. Mama. Help me. A smart one. I'm not worried. You'll learn. Eat. Look, my mother made it. It's not poison. Look. Mm. It's good. It's really good. It smells good. See? If I was gonna kill you, I would just shoot you with my gun. Here. Come on. Ah. Good girl. Good girl. Good. Good. Here. Watch your timing on the E right there at the end there. Oye, Pie, watch your own timing. What's got you so happy? Sex on a shelf, bro. Come on, let's do this. One, two, three, and-- I wish I didn't have to hurt you. But I can't help it. I got molested by someone who was supposed to be watching out for me. And nobody did nothing about it. Hey, hey. It's okay. I'm sorry that you had to suffer like that. You know that because you was hurt doesn't mean you have to hurt people back, you know. Imagine if someone was doing this to your daughter. Hm? You know, if you let me go right now, I would never tell anybody. I would just say I got in, like, an accident and passed out and... And I swear to you, it is. It's what I would say. Well, that sounds like a really good idea. I got me a real little sharp one here, huh? Yeah. Yeah. When do you feel like doing this? Right now, right this second? What? Come on. Come on, girl. Get up. Okay. I can't walk very well, though. I reckon I'm gonna have to carry your sweet little ass. Thank you. Whoo, that was a good idea! Wait. Where are you going? You stupid enough to think that I was gonna let you out of here that easy? But I've done everything you said to me! Please! You have to let me go! Maybe I'll let you go, maybe not. Maybe I'll let you go at Christmas. No. * Jingle bells, jingle bells * Jingle all the way * Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh * * Hey It's Santa Claus with a present for guess who. Ah. Ah. Hey. Hey, there's rules with TV just like there's rules with everything else. Actually, just, uh, one rule. Can you guess what it is? No, I'm sure you're gonna tell me. Ah. No. No blacks. No African-Americans, or I'll take it away. Do it again. Sing?

That's beautiful. You think you could write something for me? And I could bring it in, then I could play lead on it. It would be really good for me. Well, I already wrote you something. You already did? Want to see it? Sure. I titled it "Concrete." "Concrete. Now I lay here on the floor shivering and ashamed because no one truly loves me or cares about me." This is about you, not me. Yeah? I wouldn't be so sure. What are you talking about? You're in prison. And it's worse than me because the prison is you. You know what? You're stupider than I thought. I mean, aren't you cold yet and shivering because nobody cares about you? You shut the hell up! Shut up! Ariel? Hey. Come on, open up. Hey, hermano. - Ariel. Hola. Hey, Dad. Hi. Thanks for bringing them by. Ah. They've been dying to see you, man. Hey, hey, hey. Where you going? My room to see if my uniform's there. It's not there. I cleared everything out. I was just gonna look anyway. I said it's not there. And it's a mess. Come on, forget about it. Who wants hot dogs? Hot dogs? What's that? It's the dog. I had to lock her upstairs. She was tearing up my stuff. I've been cooped up all day inside. Let's go outside, everybody. Come on, go outside. Let's go. Hey. Don't look scared. It's okay. You had to try that once.

We're going home. You think I'm that big of an idiot? Is that what you think? Huh? Aah! Oh, my God. Oh, my knee. Oh, my knee. You're gonna pray for mercy. You stupid bitch. You're not what I wanted! How come I never, ever get what I want? Because you're-- Why? Why? Shh! No, please, let her go. Let her go! No! Run! Run, run, run! - Come here! Help us! Help us! Help us! Let her go! Please let her go! Please let her go! Help us! Anyone that's seen anything or even thinks they have call the number on the flyer. I want my baby girl to come home to me. In the four weeks since Amanda Berry went missing, police have yet to come up with a s-- No, no, no. No, no, no. You're in the front room now. Who are you? I'm Michelle Knight. We had Art together. You don't remember? How long have you been in here? Since August. Nine months. Shh. There's no talking between you two unless I'm there. If I hear one word one of you dies. You got that? Sit down. No, no. No, please. Please don't. Please, please. No, no, no! Shh, shh. Amanda. Amanda. He said not to talk. You and I need to come up with a plan and trick him so we can get out of here. Amanda. Please don't talk. Please. Amanda? On the day that marks two months since Amanda Berry disappeared on her way home from work, friends, family and neighbors gathered here on this busy street corner where the 17-year-old was last seen. They found-- * Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream * Crap. There's a lot of stuff that she won't do, so you have to. Since when did you start asking for permission? Hey, why are you only getting fat in one spot? I'm not. Did the moron go and get herself pregnant? No. I'm not-- I didn't. I'm not having one of your ugly babies in this house! Come here. Stay away from me. Come here! Stay away from me! Tomorrow, it better be gone. Good news, little gal. I got a job out back that needs doing, so guess what, missy. You and me, we're going outside. Here, put these on. Come on. Okay, I need you to hold these boards while I cut them. Grip the boards. You making my coffin? Well, don't give me any ideas. Help. Hey! Eyes. Eyes. Hold the boards. Hey. Help me. - Amanda. - Don't talk. There was a guy outside. He saw me. He saw the chains. He saw it all. He's gonna call the police, and we're going home. They're here. The cops are here. They're coming up. Oh, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Hey! Hey! Hey. You can't touch me! Did you see what he did to me? Did you see that? Amanda, I told you. They're here. Thank you. All units respond. Officer down. All right, I'm good. I'm good. For real. I'm good. Let's go. You're lucky this time, sir. Two-two-five in pursuit. Nine-two-four responding. No. Mommy? Mommy? Joey? Mommy? I'd never leave you. I'm sorry. Happy birthday, Joey. Pick up the drill. You're gonna drill two holes in that baseboard and then run the chain in one hole and out the other. Let's go. Press it against it. Press harder. Push! Get off! Amanda. Amanda, are you in there? Yes. It was hard to tell where it was coming from, there was music playing but sort of over there. Well, I don't hear it now. It stopped after a few minutes, that's what scared me. Well, you hear any more screaming, try to be sure you know where it's coming from before calling. Have a good night. Cleveland's west side was combed inch by inch as investigators and volunteers searched for the missing teen. Investigators said that Gina DeJesus was walking home from middle school on Friday with a friend when they went separate ways here at the intersection of Lorraine and 110th. I brought you some company. Sit down. Cut it short. Like the Army. Be back in a minute. Oh. Every door, window, has an alarm so don't be stupid enough and think about trying anything. And if you do, I will kill you and make the other one watch. And no talking. Just cut it short. Girl, he's just gonna get mad, okay? He said not to talk. Please don't be scared. We're gonna be okay. We'll get out. There's three of us now so we can outsmart him. There's three of us? What are you talking about? The whole family together at last. He offered me a ride. I'm friends with his daughter Lianne so, you know, I thought it would be okay. We need to talk about how to get out of here, okay? You need to stay alive for your mom and your dad and all your sisters because they love you. I can never see them again. Look at me. I am filthy, I am dirty. I think that we can get out of here together. I think that we can get really strong. And I know his weaknesses, and we can outwit him. And you want to know why else? Because God... God is in this room. Every day with me, he's here. And he has not let me down yet. I just want my mom. I just want my mom. Today, on this very painful anniversary, there is no way Nancy and me could have made it through this year without all the support and love you've given us. And again, we ask the people of Cleveland to notify the police if you see or hear anything that can help us find our Gina and bring her home safe. Nancy, I love Gina. You know we're all doing everything we can to bring her home. Bless you, Ariel. Bless you. You got to see what's on TV. A crowd gathered Look. Including Gina's family. Oh, man, look. Look at the look on your mom's face. If she only knew who she was blubbering all over. Oh, hey, hey. Don't cover that beautiful face. Hey. Dude, I'll do it. Hey, dude. Let me do it. Shut up. Shut up. I'll do whatever you want. You're just pissed off because nobody's holding any candlelight vigils for you! That's why I hate you! Nobody loves you! Nobody misses you! Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do! Yeah, they do! You hate yourself! Get away! Oh, no! I can't reach you! I can't reach you! I can't reach you! Seventeen, 18, 19, 20. High five. I'm bored. Put on a show. He's just gonna feed our bodies to the dogs. And my mom's never gonna know what happened to me. Come here. Just leave me alone, okay? We're gonna get through this, okay? The only thing that has the possibility to kill us is this freaking cold right now. And there's only one solution for that. Music time. There you go. Move. * Get up, get up 'Cause this is the song * * You been waitin' for All the boys in the club * * Get up, get up All the girls in the-- * It's been nearly three years since her teenage daughter disappeared. Tonight, the mother of Amanda Berry is dead. She fought tirelessly to keep alive the memory of her daughter. Doctors say Louwana died of congestive heart failure. Perhaps that's the scientific term for a broken heart. Every minute she told me there wasn't a second... ...she wouldn't think of Amanda. Amanda's bedroom remains unchanged. Christmas presents. You know, I always wished that she was my mother and said those things about me. --To search for her daughter. They're gonna have to stand before God someday and see what happens. Today's a special day. Gonna celebrate. I got a present for y'all. I think you're smart enough by now. You keep being good, you can say adiós to these. What do you mean by "adiós"? I mean goodbye. No more locks. Come on, come downstairs real quick! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Michelle, we're... We're out. Come on, Gina. Oh, my God, is what you don't realize, is that he's playing a trick on us. Come on downstairs! Come on! This is why I did all this. So we could be together like this. Like a family. Okay. Are you ready for the big announcement? Okay. Right around the end of January, there's gonna be a new member to our family. Now, how's that to ring in the New Year, huh? Really? Yeah. She's in labor. You screwed up. - What? Why is it happening so early? How far apart are contractions? Well, how the hell should I know? Go. Go get the pool. Move! Move! Careful. If this baby doesn't come out alive, I'm gonna pull this trigger! I gotta push! No, don't push. It's too soon. Stop screaming like that! She can't help it! She's in pain. Gina, come here. I don't wanna go. I wanna stay and help. No. It's not safe here now. It hurts so much! Is something wrong? Whatever's wrong, you better fix it. Oh, God. I think you're ready to push. Grab her hand. Grab her-- I think it's ready. I think it's ready-- What did you do to her, bitch? I didn't do anything to her! Maybe you dropped her or something. I don't know. All right, push. Grab. Ready? Push! Push. Push! Push, damn it. It's a girl. You had a beautiful baby girl. Gina, grab the tie. Grab the tie. Cut. Cut above-- Cut above the tie. Is she okay? Why is she not breathing? Make her breathe. You want me to pull this trigger? Please, baby. Oh, my God. Make her breathe. Oh, my God. Oh, no. Come on. Please. Please, God. Please. Please. Please. Thank you. Thank you, God. Thank you. Hey, baby. Hey. I got her. I got her. My baby. Get out. Are you Daddy's little princess? Are you my princess? Huh? Are you mine, mine, mine? Are you all mine? Are you mine, mine, mine, huh? Oh, you're so beautiful. It's a big day in the Castro house. Okay, Jocelyn. Can you walk? Can you walk? Come on. Can you walk? Come on. Just a few more steps, Jocelyn. Come on. Do that again for the camera. Hey. Yay! Yay! Three, and one for good luck. Okay. Make a wish, sweetheart. So from 9 to 9:30, we have story time and then it's Jocelyn's favorite class of all: Art class. Yes. I love you, Auntie Juju. I love you, Auntie Chelsea. Love you. Lookit. But who do you love the most? Daddy. Oh, this-- Okay. It's recess time for the art teacher. Let's go. Yeah. I'm two payments behind on my property taxes and I could lose my house. Yeah, I get it. I get it, I know. A job will turn up soon. Bye. You got that from the trash? So? It's perfectly good. Like I'm not sick enough. Hey, it's time for my program. Come on. Everybody, mandatory. Come on. Chelsea. Missing the program is not allowed. Daddy, we should all go to the park. Mommy, Auntie Juju and Auntie Chelsea too. No, they can't. Why not? Because they can't. Okay? That's not a good because. Why can't Auntie Juju or Auntie Chelsea come? And why can't I talk about them to anyone? Shh. I want to know why. Why, why, why. Okay, will you shut her up? You gotta be quiet! Let her go! She's gotta be quiet! Let her-- But she's gotta be quiet! Let her go. She's gotta stay quiet. No, you took it. I did not. I told you you couldn't borrow my stuff. After I plant some corn I'm gonna put in some squash against the fence. Why don't you just cut the act? Okay, you shut up. Dig. I will dig. I'm gonna dig it so deep that the dogs can't dig up the evidence and then I'll dig it big enough for the three of us. What are you gonna tell Jocelyn? Hm? Okay, I'm warning you. That her mom just... Just doesn't love her and run away? She won't believe you. She already hates you, so you're screwed either way-- You shut up! This is what I'm afraid of. Jocelyn growing up in here like this. I'm scared it could screw her up. I never meant for this to get this big. You know, it just got out of hand. Well, then why don't you just turn yourself in? Huh? Maybe if you turned yourself in, they won't go so hard and they'll go easier. Right. And let my whole family know what I've been doing? Who cares about what your family thinks? It's only about God. Where was God when he let you get into my car? You know where he was. The only time that we don't see him is when we're scared to look. I never meant to hurt you. Or anybody. I couldn't help it. You know how I got messed up? You've told me what they had done to you, and God knows. He's just waiting for you to open your heart. You can ask him to take the pain away and tell him, "I'm ready to change." Do I feel hot? Mm-hm. Maybe if we wear disguises, he'll have a doctor come look at you. Oh, I love this song. Let's dance. Okay. Let's dance. All right. Come on. Hey, I'm going to my mom's house to get us some food. You be good. Why'd Daddy leave the front door open? I don't know, maybe he's still here. Did you hear his car drive away? Yeah. Mommy, you can't go outside. Daddy'll get mad. It's okay, he'll understand. Whatever happens now, I love you, okay? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! I'm Amanda Berry. I've been locked in here for 10 years. You can't be Amanda. She's dead. You've gotta get me out. He'll come back. I don't understand. - Hurry! Get back. Kick it in. Kick it in. Daddy, I want my daddy. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. * When I was young I used to have a lot of fun * Cleveland P.D.! - Breaching. - Two, three. What was that? Probably somebody trying to break in. But who would wanna break into this place? I don't hear Jocelyn. She's never quiet for this long. Clear! Go hide. Go. - Okay. Sounds like there's two of them. We're the police. Is anybody up here? Michelle. Police, is anybody up there? Anybody can say they're the police and it could be him trying to trick us, right? Get down and stay down and do not come out until I say. Okay? Answer me if you can hear. Is anybody here? Hey, come on out. It's okay. Hey, we're the police. You're the police? Police? And you saved us. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Gina. Gina, they found us. We're free. I'm Georgina DeJesus. Oh, my Lord. I've been looking for you for nine years. Let's get you out of here. No, no. Please, he could show up and kill us. It's okay, I won't let you go. You're safe, it's over. One seventeen to base. - Go, 117. We found them. We found them. I'm coming home, Joey! I'm free! We're free! All three women were rescued from a home just now. An absolutely unbelievable story. It was a night full of emotion and drama. They were missing for more than... --screams from a nearby house. They also found Michelle Knight, who went missing in 2002. Paging Dr. Adler. Please come to X-ray. Hydrate. Dr. Adler to X-ray. No men, no men. Only women. Okay, men, out. On my count, three, two, one, go. Let's go. I wanna see my son. I want him to know I'm alive, please. Well, look who's awake. Good morning. How do you feel? Three men are now in custody. It smells so clean. So clean. I wanna see my son. Do you know where we can contact him? I don't know. He went into a foster home right before he took-- He took me. Do you think anybody here could help me? Don't worry. We'll look into it for you. Is there any family we can call for you? Nobody that wouldn't know how to find me if they wanted to. The other girls returned home. Amanda Berry's family lets us know her and her daughter are doing well. They ask that we give them their privacy for this time of healing and recovery. And in other news. Oh, my. Hello. Oh, my goodness. Would you look at all that? I swear, we need to give some of this away. Yes. Except for this one. What a cutie. Aww. Joey would love this. I keep forgetting that Joey's almost 16 now. I wonder if I would even recognize him at this point or if he would remember me. Yeah. Can I see her? Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh, Jake Solano, FBI. Can we talk for a minute? Is that all right? Jake Solano, FBI? I think the doctors promised you something once you were cleared for solid food? Mm. A cheeseburger from Steak 'n Shake? Mm-hm. With triple fries and a cheesecake Blizzard from Dairy Queen. Thank you. Oh, my God. You are an angel a million times over. Mm. Mm. Mm. I think I better not rush it. Oh, here. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you. It's okay. I'm sorry. You know, whenever he wanted me to shut up he would put that kind of napkin down my throat. I just wanna find my son. Have you found my son? Not yet, but trust me, we're-- We're on it. Michelle? Oh, hey. Sorry. Your mother's here. Can you please tell her that I'm not up for it today? Actually, please tell her that I don't want to see her or else she's gonna keep coming back. Are you sure? Carla, you've seen parents of missing children, right? They keep the kids' bedrooms intact as if they never went missing or they keep their voice on the voicemail so they can listen to their kid's voice again and again and again even if it is 10 years. He always told me nobody cared, always. And one time he marched in my room and he said: "Told you nobody cared. Your mom packed up and moved to Florida." There was never one candlelight vigil for me. Okay? Thank you. I was beginning to think the world was just all blurry. Your therapist was here again to see you. I'm not-- I'm not ready yet, please. Ariel Castro standing in the court during the arraignment, eyes cast down all the time never looking up at anyone. No other reaction from the man. Also with him were his two brothers, who have been eventually released. So when will I get to put Joey's school picture in this frame? Well, it's about waiting for the adoption agency to respond to our request. You, um-- You gonna be okay here? Yeah, am I gonna be okay? A queen-size bed and all these chairs to sit in just for me for the first time in my life? Yes, I'm gonna be great. Well, then I'm glad you're happy. And I'll check in on you as soon as I can. Okay. I miss him so much. It's like, what does he even look like? I wonder if his name is still Joey. Michelle, I've been talking to my parents and... I don't know. Maybe I just... I just need to start living my normal life. Just for right now. What do you mean? You can't just pretend like this never happened and go back. Look, um, I'll see you again soon, okay? I promise. Just not right away. I'm sorry. I love you. I love you too. Hi. Hi. So did you find Joey? Um. I think maybe you should sit down. Joey's foster parents adopted him when he was 4 years old and they've decided that it's not in his best interest to see you. He's-- He's doing well. They just don't want any of the commotion and attention to upset his life. But I'm not trying to upset him. I just wanted to hold and hug him. And just tell him that I love him. Can I just do that? Well, we raised the possibility of a supervised visit. They made it very clear on what they thought was best for him. Is his name even Joey anymore? I can't tell you that, I'm sorry. May I see a picture, please? I got the strong sense that they're most comfortable with no contact whatsoever. I did talk to a family lawyer I know. According to him, in a situation where the birth mother was not consulted the adoption can be voided. Would you talk to him about that? Do you mind if I have some time by myself, please? Michelle? Hey. I'm sorry if I'm intruding. You know, I-- No, you're not. I wanted to talk to you about something. Anything. You know, I always saw myself, more than anything, as Joey's mother. Mm. And I know that I will be somebody. But I don't want a family lawyer. You know, Joey, he's happy now, you know? He has a family and a life. And I don't wanna go blowing that up. It just doesn't feel right to me. You're sure? Yeah. It hurts like you wouldn't believe, but I'm sure. You're an amazing woman, Michelle. I don't know how amazing I am, you know? I don't even really know how Michelle I am. Maybe I am stronger than I would have been had I not gotten into that truck, you know? Mm. I mean, I literally did not know where I was going that day. But that was the caterpillar, you know? And now I'm ready for butterflies. And this was one of the crimes of the century. Jeff, I want to ask you about Michelle Knight one of the victims in this case. She may appear in person in the courtroom to give her say. I find that unbelievably courageous, a woman who's been through this hell. Keep in mind, this man kept her in a darkened room for much of the time. She was chained up. Fed her once a day. She became pregnant and he... You're ugly. You're stupid! Nobody loves you! Nobody's looking for you! Gonna break your face! You're not having my baby! I hate you! My name is Michelle Knight, and I would like to tell you what this was like for me. I missed my son every day and I wondered if I was ever gonna see him again. I cried every night because I was so alone. The days never got shorter. Days turned into nights, and nights turned into days. And the years turned into eternity. I knew at that point, nobody cared about me. Ariel Castro, you took 11 years of my life away. And I have got it back. I spent 11 years in hell and now your hell is just beginning. The death penalty would be so much easier. You don't deserve that. You deserve to spend a life in prison. I can forgive you but I can't forget. With the guidance of God I will prevail and help others that suffer at the hands of others. Writing this statement gave me the strength to be a stronger woman and I know there is more good than there is evil. I know that there's a lot of people going through hard times. But we need to reach out a hand and hold them and let them know that they're being heard. After 11 years, I'm finally being heard and it's liberating. Thank you all. I love you. And God bless. * Living all alone In the corners of my mind * * Hoping, praying, wishing To see you one more time * * Living alone My baby's shadows * * Dance across the wall * In my dreams I hold you And never let you fall * * Living all alone In the corners of my mind * * Hoping, praying, wishing To see you one more time * * See you one more time One more time *
