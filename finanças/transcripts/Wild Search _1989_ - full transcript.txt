See whether the dead is your sister? Sister! Mew, the photos and some documents of the dead has been missing. That amah said that she's been tied up while sleeping. Can she recognize the one? The antique shop has been in a mess. Nothing can be find. Aunt Cher, I don't want to go to grandpa's house. Say hello to grandpa when you see him. Grandpa doesn't like me. Who said so?

Don't eat chili. Any more else? Especially cigarette and wine. You have to stop smoking and drinking wine. Later we have to go and buy some pots. What are you observing? To see whether there is any leak. You hear. To what? Listen whether the sound is abnormal or not. Then what? Then means it has leak, listen carefully. Miss, you have broken all my pots already. So trouble for so little purchase, I better close it. The people nowadays are impolite. Only observing, she has to scold. People are rich. Can we report them impolite to the police station? Are you out of your mind saying such thing. Thing is like this. - Don't drive too fast. - I know it already. I ask you not to drive so fast. After buying the medicine and the pots, she said that she have to buy me some bandages. I already said it's OK. Then I told her that I am a bit exhausted. She massaged me. How intensive she is. It's really good. Fantastic, right? Woman is really troublesome, how come need to buy so much medicine. A can of beer will be OK. Women are born to be so troublesome. Exactly. I haven't seen you been so happy for a long time already. True? It does with, that woman is quite beautiful. You better shut up. Don't teach me to date the woman in front of my wife and son.

Nothing, I just want to know whether you have drunk that medicine or not? I am just having it. How do you feel? It's bitter! Bitter is good! One important thing I've forgotten to tell you. You have to add that small pack, after one hour. Do you see what I mean? Any big different? Of course, my father taught me so. And you have to drink it while it's hot. Cher! Who has to take medicine? It's Ah Leung! Why does Ah Leung need to take medicine? Being attack. Being attack, let me talk to him. Are you Ah Leung? Are you Alright? What's happening? Tell him that I have to go to the toilet. Who are you? I am his friend. Where's Ah Leung then? - Ah Leung... - He's in the toilet. He's in the toilet. Why he has to go to the toilet? Drinking too much beer. Still drink the beer. You ask him whether there is any blood in his stools. What? Ask him to see whether there is any blood in his stools. Hey, check whether there is any blood in the stools? Don't know how to take care of oneself. Still drink beer while taking medicine. That woman again. Stop drinking beer while taking medicine, it's harmful. No, I haven't drink any beer. Why can't you take care of yourself. Anything more to remind me, I'm really big head. Nothing, I have to hang up! Hang up already! Woman is really troublesome. Trouble? I think you seems very pleasant. You have to take this medicine daily. Stop smoking! And drink less beer. Be careful! - No! - Why? Let them learn something. Kiss! Give it to me. Switch it on, come again... Then? What's wrong? Sand has run into my eyes. Let me blow it out for you. Be careful! Not yet, it's still inside! - Any more? - Yes! Alright... My pupils are blown out by you as well. This one! That guy has been following me for a few days already. Bullet will find out who he is, right? Must have some connection with that police. Mr. Hung, you better keep calm. Bullet will settle the whole thing. - Ask him to be quick. - Yes, Mr. Hung! - You been here long? - Just a while! - Are you drink? - It's still early! They have all come. Quit from parking already. Of course, can't even survive. See what do you want to do. See whether I can help or not? Mew Mew, don't worry about me. It's quite easy to survive. I still do not get any information after following that Mr. Hung! Will he be innocent with that ammunition dealing? He's a Sino-Vietnamese. Come to HK less than years. Will he be so rich only doing garments? Right, the under-cover fee of last time has not yet issued. You just take this first. On you knees. Escape, run for life. You better show up yourself! Come out! Darn it, I have to kill you today. Darn it, I must kill him. Bullet, hold it! Start it now! Can't you move downtown with me. The business of my metalwork shop is growing, I need your help. You always said that I am stupid and clumsy. How can I help you. That woman is so clever, why don't you ask her for help. - Let me do it! - No need! - Cher! - Mew Mew! Looking for me? I have a picture of the suspects for Ka Ka to see. She's playing out there, let me show you the way. - Let me help you! - No need! What's your name? Are you Cher's brother? She's my wife! Ka Ka! Mew Mew! Uncle Mew, I have call you last night. But no one is on the phone. Really? Mew Mew is on duty last night. See, do you remember this man? That is muscular uncle. Is that the one inside the empty unit? Have you arrested him? Not yet, he's kill one of our men last night. The bullet found on the location is the same with your sister. We suspected him to be the one who killed your sister. Mew Mew, cycle with me. Alright, let's go cycling. Hey, can you lend me your bicycle? Alright, return to me later. I will put it back here. Cher, let us go home. How's your being complained case proceeded? It will be alright! Are you going home? Mew, let's go cycle there. - Let's go... - Sit well. According to the statement of the five witnesses. You charged Mr. Hung of being order someone to attack you. Then you forced him to get off the car. Two of his staffs has tried to stop you. You used your gun to force Mr. Hung to kneel on the ground. Do you have any objection to this? I've been attack first before I met Mr. Hung. I strongly believe that he's the one who order his man. I will take action only if he resist to co-operate. But now the one suspected to attack has not yet been arrested. By what do you think that they are co-operative? You can just ask Mr. Hung to get down the car for investigation. Mr. Hung did not have any attacking weapons. You don't need to use your own gun, and ask him to kneel down as well. Any more to add. How come champagne is so expensive. I just buy one for celebration. He has not yet come out? How's the situation? Retained temporary, and dismissed under consideration. What, for celebration? Yes! Mew, it'll be OK. It's just a cover up, and just a explanation to the public. My wife and son had been killed by the robber, who had given me any explanation? I've been a cop for sixteen years, I've been working hard. No one will complain if I am lazy. Mew Mew, Ah Leung is the husband of Cher. You ask me how deep is my love and how much do I love you.

The kids nowadays are much luckier, had to eat the skin of the tree when I am small. Really? Papa, why are you here? Uncle Lee is coming to see Ka Ka! Let's dine together later! Good! Ah Leung has come to see you today, he's still home when I came out. I am confused as well. Must a woman stay with only one man. You make your own decision. The goods from Vietnam has arrived today. Have you checked them? Yes, but nothing special. Let's go and have a look. Now? Time will be just match. Keep your foot in. Don't make any noise! The warehouse is at the left front. That's Mr. Hung's fellow. Right, he is trying to relocate my goods. Let's call the police. - Hi! - What's wrong? I am Sergeant Lau. Some one on the next street is trying to steal. Please inform the headquarters. Take care! Kneel down! Blood! Mew Mew, you've been hurt. Kau, escape after moving this last case. Kau, BB, come over! What's wrong? Escape! Quick! Drive away! Escape, here comes the police. Quick! Stop and don't move! Kneel down, hands on your heads. Don't move! Kneel down. Don't move! The tire has burst. Mew, how are you? Bumped on their car! - Drive the car to them! - the engine has broke down. Mew, how are you? Big Eye, how are you? Mew, wake up! Quickly drive the car! Big Eye! Stop it, quick! Mew Mew! The door can't be opened! The car is moving backward, wake up! Quickly get down the car! Escape, the police is coming. Mew Mew! Bye Bye! Any one answer the phone? No one! Don't be nervous, drink some water first. Thank you! Sorry, we have to close now. I am sorry! Let's go! Be quick! What are you looking? You dare to betray me? Say to the judge. Darn it! Come out. They force me to do so, it's not my will. I will kill if I see you one more time. Get in that car! No one can save you. Looking for what? Here are the medicines for a few days, you have to follow the schedule. Doctor, is he OK? It's OK, just some connection with the bones will be OK! Take a rest, I leave now! Kee will be the witness on court, Mr. Hung will be of big trouble. You idiot. Police is looking for you everywhere, we better go back to Vietnam. I have found a ship. I won't go, I have to kill that police. He has to compensate for my leg. Do you feel better today? I think the Chinese medicine will be better. Sleep for awhile. When can we go car racing? I prefer taking the public vehicles. It won't hurt so much when in accidents. Quickly drink it, or the nurse will scold when seeing t his. Don't be silly! Has Ah Leung come to see you? Yes, he comes everyday. I will talk to him when I get out here. Alright! - It's too hot. - It's so hot. This necklace belongs to my wife. She asked me to give it to you in my dream last night. It's OK already. She also said that I always forget everything. So she asked you to take good care of me from now on. If you don't said no, I will promise her for you. Put it on! This necklace weights more than a tael. Ka Ka, eat more vegetable, it's good for health. Papa, I am coming back! - Is Ka Ka good girl or not today? - Good! Ah Leung has moved in. Who allow him to do so? I have considered it seriously, it will be better for us to living together. But we have no more connection. This is useless for you to move in again. I have let the shop to some one else. I plan to build a bigger house next door. So that everyone can live better. Give him one more chance since you've been couples. Did he gave me any chance when he abandoned me? Mew, your duty has recovered. Rest more, come back to work when you are totally recovered. - Thank you Uncle Jim! - Where are you going? To have a discussion with my competitor of affection. Do you need any help? Take care! Inform us earlier once you get married. Bye Bye! Going home... Ka Ka, help grandpa to feed the chicks, alright? Of course! Uncle Lee! - Mew Mew! - You are OK now? - Let me hold her... - Uncle will hold you later. I don't want you, you are so ugly. If you said one more word I will lock you up with the chicks. - Is Ka Ka good girl or not today? - Good! Mew Mew! Why you are so late? I think you won't come again? The traffic jam. He is running here to take the Chinese medicine. Nam! Mew Mew play with me. Come in and have a seat! Mew Mew, let's go cycling. Mew Mew has not yet recovered, let uncle Nam play with you. Good girl, let uncle cycling with you OK? Alright! Ah Leung is inside. You better have a good discussion. Sit well, Ka Ka! Ah Leung! - Take a seat! - Thanks! Bullet, that police has entered that village. I am going to kill him. - Have a drink! - Thank you! Ah Leung, Cher told me that you have moved in. You are a reasonable man. You understand what affection is. What are talking about, you are not welcome, get out here! We are both adults. I warn you, get out here! Why can't we make it clear? Alright, if you don't want to go, stay here! Ah Leung... Ah Leung, why you shut the door, open it, Ah Leung! Ah Leung, what are you trying to do? - Don't border me... - Are you crazy! You dared to tempt my wife, I will kill you. Ah Leung, what are you doing? Ah Leung is trying to hurt other with a knife. - What, killing? - Ah Leung, put down the knife. Ah Leung, Ah Leung... Put down the knife, Ah Leung... Fight no more! You stop it! Wong, call the police, quick! Stop it! Ah Leung! Cycle more faster, so slow! It's already every fast. Sit well, are you alright, uncle is clumsy in cycling. What can we do? Get away! - Darn it. - Help. - Tempt my wife. - Stop it! Ah Leung! Kneel down! Get out! Kneel down! You better come out you own. Kneel down... - Who's that? - I am not looking for you. You will know who am I if you come out. Police, are you No. one... Kneel down! Don't fire, don't fire... Get out! Are you OK? Hide yourselves! Don't fire! Where's that police? Don't fire, he's at the kitchen. - Show me the way! - No! Police, drop the gun down! No, please don't! Get up and show me the way! No, please don't! Where's Mew Mew? Don't fire... You dare fired, I have a man on hand. Don't fire! Please don't, it's Ah Leung... I know you are up there, you better come down. - If not, I'll kill him. - No! Any more entrance?

Burn you! Be careful, he's taking a knife. Darn it! Kneel down! Escape... Released me... No, it's too dangerous. Stand still, can you hear me? Help, save the life and put off the fire, quick! Mew Mew, Ah Leung! Be calm! Put off the fire! Ask more people to help. Be quick! Be careful, put him down here. Someone is climbing out! It's Ah Leung, save him, quick... Quick, save Ah Leung!
