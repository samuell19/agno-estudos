( hip-hop music playing ) Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Showtime! You're staring again, Eddie. Your husband is paying me to watch you, Mrs. Spinelli. l'm just doing my job. Why don't you make yourself useful, and do my back? ( moans) Oh, that's so nice! Don't worry, Eddie, my husband won't be home until tonight. And please, call me Tia. - Undo my top. - Sure. l don't like tan lines. ( moans ) You have such strong hands. l need strength like yours. - Hey! Hey! - What're you doing, get off me! Hey, what are you doing? lt's not what it looks like, Mr. Spinelli. Look, l swear, this was not my idea! - ( clicks) - Safety's on, asshole. Disloyal pig! - Why? - l'm sick of your handouts. With you gone, l get everything. The police will find two dead men and two guns, l will tearfully tell them that the two of you fought over me and both lost. l'm sorry, babe. Sometimes love hurts. Director: _nd... cut! - Ouch! - Director: Okay, print that one. Great. Thank you guys, that was terrific. Mam, nice job. Dry him off, please. Ms. Tyler, can l speak to you for a moment? - Sure. - Ahem... l would-- l'd like to do one more take. Why, is it something l'm doing? Actually, it's something you're not doing. You're supposed to be setting Eddie up by wantonly seducing him. He's got to really believe you're on the level here. All right, l agree. Candy, you're protecting your breasts too much. Ross, we've gone over this, okay? It's in my contract. No nudity. Your top is practically glued on. lt's not going anywhere. You'd be more convincing if you stopped acting as if it was. Okay? All right. One more. - You can do this. - l know. All right. Let's go. Ross: All right, first position, everybody. - Marker. - Six, three pick-up. Candy: Yeah, l thought that was great. - Where's your driver? All the fuss? l'll just drive myself. Last week you fired your personal assistant. Are you going native? l guess l'm a little tired of having strangers in my life. Why don't we fix that? Why don't we get to know each other over dinner? Tonight? l'm sorry, Ross, l can't. l got a script to read and l'm exhausted. l just want to go to bed early. Okay, tomorrow l'll pick you up at 8:OO. Let me buy you a thank-you dinner. You fought for me on this film when l really needed it. That's sweet. Maybe next week. Okay? l'll call you. We'll set something up. l promise. ( man knocking on door ) Nobody does seduction and deceit like Candice Tyler. Don't do that historical thing with Levinson, just keep giving them what they want. All right, all right. But then l need to get paid more for doing it. One of your movies opens bigger, l'll get you a bigger up front. Then l need more work, Frank. Book me back to back if you have to. What's with you, Candy? That IRS thing. l thought you were appealing that IRS thing. My lawyer quit. They really got it rigged real good. You spend what little you have left to defend what little you have left. - l'm completely broke. - What are you talking about? They are gonna repossess everything l own, and my future earnings, unless l come up with a huge settlement now! - What about your investments? - The market's how l got into this mess. We're gonna have to keep this under wraps as long as we can. What are you talking about? lf this gets out, the studio execs, they'll know you're desperate. Great. So, where does this lead me? l can't guarantee anything right away. ( gunman yells) Boo! Son of a bitch! ( both chuckle ) How did you get in here? l told you l'd meet you outside. There's no lock made that could keep me out, Fred, you know that. - Why did you call? - Why do you think l called? l wanted to see my old jailhouse pal. Yeah! Hey, l've got a job for you. l'm required by my parole officer to inform all future employers that l have been convicted of a felony and l've done time in a Federal institution. But l'm totally rehabilitated now. Well, it does my heart good to know that our jail system worked so good. You're hired. l want to show you something. Sit down. fred:This is Candice Tyler, the movie actress. l've been tracking her for a couple of days. l've been in her house and l know the code to the alarm system. So, what do you think? ls it safe on the premises? lt's not a robbery. We're stealing something else. You mean her? - Yeah. - A kidnapping? You'll get the FBl up your ass in five minutes. So, how much ransom you going for? None. We get more another way. A lot more. When it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. l learned that in jail. Oh, Brad! You're getting cynical in your old age, my friend. Yeah, whatever. Charming rich ladies out of credit cards and savings accounts? - That's what you did time for. - Yeah. lt's a big jump from lounge lizard shit to snatching movie stars, Fred. Look... if l wasn't sure about this, l never would've called you. l want you to meet my partner. l steer, but he makes it go. Put that gun away. Okay. l'll let him convince me. You're doing a shim job of it. Oh, don't be so cynical. So l take it you like Iost causes? Walt, this is the guy l told you about. He can get into any place, any time. Brad Vorman, Walt Gearson. The only real genius l ever met. Hey, sorry. My hands are kind of wet. Huh. l see it's not going to be Iove at first sight. Let me know when he does something smart. Come on! Let him show you. What, like a dog and pony show? Oh, come on! He needs to find faith. All right, prepare for a new skill technology, my friend. Step this way. Wipe your feet, will you? l just vacuumed. - Nice place. - l call it home. New skill, huh? l spent the last three years in prison. You learn to live with the essentials. So you did time? What for? - Electronic embezzlement. - Walt here, he stole a million dollars from the U.S. Treasury Department. With what? A bazooka? l don't need a bazooka, pal. Laptop? A complete chassis l redesigned-- my design. Yeah, l'm very impressed. But what's this got to do with the movie star? ( Fred chuckles ) For one night, and one night only, Candice Tyler, ''movie goddess,'' is going to be having sex, live, on the Internet. - On our web site. - No shit? - How do we set this up? - l infiltrate a dozen servers. Net se_ers all over the world will see our free two-minute pop-up ad. rhey'll show a live image of one of the world's the most beautiful stars, totally nude. That'll get their attention. Then what? Word of mouth will spread instantly across the Net. Hits on the site should triple about every 18 seconds. An hour later, we netcast 20 minutes more. That's how you came up with the figure of a minimum of one million per man? One million? No, no, no. Worst case projection is that 20S/o of the people seeing the pop-up will pay 10 bucks to see the rest. That would make it-- ( keys clicking ) 2.7 million per man, give or take 100,OOO or so. All undeclared and tax-free, of course. That is a hell of a lot more than we'd ever get from any ransom. Okay, so, how do we get the money, without getting caught? Encrypted codes. All offshore bank accounts. How do you stop anyone from tracing all this back to you? That's easy. l've developed new free-floating trading systems, on a perpetually shifting network of encrypted files. - Say what? - He means the source code is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. They can't trace it fast enough. By the time they do, we are long gone ghosts. lt's prem damn good, don't you think? As long as the money is not free-floating and ever-changing, l'm cool. Oh, no! The money is going to be waiting for us in the Bahamas. Fun in the sun. You guys want a beer? Fred: Yeah. - What's this guy's story? - His wife divorced him and took the kid while he was inside. He's trying to get him back. Hey! lf you embezzled a million dollars, why not buy a mansion? Walt: The feds found out where l hid it. l was prem inexperienced back then, but l've learned a few tricks since. Well, how did you get out so soon? Snitching? No. l hacked into the state computer... issued myself a parole. Damn. Hats off to you then, bro'. That's prem damn good. Um-hmm. Fred: Yeah. ( phone ringing ) Candy: Hi, Dad. How are you? Me? Oh... l've just finished another masterpiece. Shakespeare probably wouldn't be jealous, but it'll do. The funny thing is-- if only my fans knew that their sex goddess is really a prude... Was Mom hard to jump-start when she was my age? You know what l mean. Hmm? Oh, no, l'm fine, l'm fine, l just-- l wanted to hear your voice. So, is the staff treating you okay? Yeah? Dad, if you need more medicine you just ask for it, okay? No more of that macho stuff. Please. You promise? Okay. Well, listen, l'll see you Tuesday. All right. l love you too. Bye. - Daddy, this is fun. - It's fun for me too, bud. You're so good at doing the puzzle. - Look at our guy, he's so happy. - Yeah. Honey, give Daddy a kiss good night. It's time to go to bed. - Walt: l love you. Good night. - l love you. l don't know where he finds the courage. He's positive that Mommy and Daddy will make everything all right. l'm working on something right now. Great. Does that mean l can expect some child support prem soon? l'm gonna get caught up on that. We're gonna get caught up on everything. lt better be something good, because they give him two to three months unless we hospitalize him right now. - There's other places he can go. - No. l'm not talking about a free clinic, Walt. This is major surgery. - Don't you think he deserves that? - Of course l do. Well, unless you can pull a medical plan out of the sky-- That's what l'm trying to tell you. This investment, l'm working on-- l don't want to hear about your schemes and your scams. - That's what ruined our lives. - Barbara... this is a sure bet. There's no such thing, Walt. l could never get you to understand that. Good night. This here's my baby. And just like all my bitches, she's completely untraceable. Fred: Now just listen up, all right? Your job is to get us in, and then watch our back, but-- and l mean this-- no ''Fourth of July'' unless it's absolutely necessary. Look here, man. l'm a pro, all right? l know how to handle myself. But if anybody gets in between me and the score, - l'm taking their ass down! - That's not gonna happen. This is an easy score. There's no sweat, no strain. Here. Fake ID? Not only do we have cover stories, we have false identities. You like this shit, don't you? l didn't get to play enough cops and robbers when l was a kid. - l did. - ( _ips bag ) Walt. Walt! - You having second thoughts? - No. No! l just want to make sure everything goes well, Fred. We'll stick to the plan and it will. - Questions? - l'm cool. Let's go. God-- ''Bone Crusher.'' Who thinks up these titles? Hey, l ran into Jimmy C. He told me you gave him an emerald necklace to fence that turned out to be glass. Talking out both sides of his big-ass mouth, all right? - That was prime merchandise. - fred: It's tough being the thief. Brad: You're damn skippy. That's what's so sweet about this job. All we have to do is get in. Just grab and snatch the snatch. ( all chuckle ) ( Ioud heavy rock pIays ) Can you turn that bullshit off, please? - Yeah, man, no problem. - ( music stops ) Thanks. What's the matter, are you nervous? Just anxious. You'll know when l'm nervous. ( groans ) - Ready? - Let's go, ready. - ( door bangs) - ( gasps ) ( Ioud rock resumes ) ( metal scraping ) You're making too much noise. ( spray hisses ) Happy? ( faint squeak ) ( door bolt clicks ) Come on, come on, cOMe On. - She's gone. - l thought you said she'd be asleep. l said she'd be in the house. We'll give her a few minutes to settle. All according to plan, huh? Yeah. ( keypad beeping ) ( screams ) ( screaming stops ) She's out. You didn't tell me she kicks. Does she know karate or some shit? Well, you know actors-- always at the gym. She went out prem fast, man. She still breathing? Yeah, she's fine. The chloroform works quick. She's fine. You just admire her later. Go into her closet. Get some other clothes. Something we could change her into on the way there. - Yeah? - Fred:Get that van up here, now. ( engine starts ) ( tires screeching ) Man, that is more exercise than l've gotten in a long time. l'm planning to get a whole lot more this weekend. Damn, her legs are firm as shit. Leave her alone. l've been wanting to do this ever since l saw her in ''Decei_ul.'' Get off her. Hey! Get off her! Who elected you to have all the fun, homeboy? lf you came on this trip for some celebrity sex you can take a walk right now! Walt and l are in it for the money. And to get the money, we follow a plan. - Get off her! - Hey, man. We're on the same team here, remember? The time we get paid for this gig, you'll have enough money you can buy any chick you want. Think about it. Who you think y'all is, man, the pussy patrol? You got anything else to say? No. - ( low moan) - She's waking up. - ( gasping) - Help me out. Candy, calm down, we're not going to hurt you. - Brad: Relax! - Who are you? - Just a few of your fans. - What do you want? We wanna do business with you. l know you're not going to believe me, but l don't have a dime to my name. l don't have anything. l'm completely broke. You're right, l don't believe you. But it's not your money that l need. - Then what do you want? - A command performance. - What?! - You do exactly what we say, don't fight us, in 48 hours you are going to be home, safe and sound. ( poIice radio chatter ) ( siren blares ) - l've got to pull us over. - ( gasps ) Make one sound, l'll blow that prem-ass little head right off. - Do you understand? - What do you want me to do? Act like the professionals we are. Go to the front seat. ( siren bIurts ) Ms. Tyler? Do exactly what l say if you ever want to see your home again. Do you hear me? We're gonna move to the front seat. Do not take your blindfold off. - Okay. - Let's go. Now. Move. ( Candy gasps ) ( siren wails ) - Take a nice deep breath. - ( muffled groan ) Cops make me nervous. Great. That's exactly what you don't want to be right now. lf he makes one false move, l'm blowing his face off. No, you won't. Just stay cool. Shoot, he's coming. How are you doing, Officer? We're looking for Olsen Springs. Yeah, and l take it you're in a hurry to get there? License, registration and insurance, please. lt's a rental. l've got it in the visor. Do you mind if l grab it? Go right ahead. What's with the girl? She's my girlfriend. She's tired. So, you're all going to Olsen Springs to fish? Yeah, we hear the trout's fatter than a pig's ass this time of the year. ls that right? What you got in the cooler? Show him what's in the cooler, ''Ed.'' All right, you got a long way to go, Mr. Davalos. Stay on this road, till you come to Highway 13. Go south for a mile, till you see the sign for Olsen Springs. Heep it slow in my county, you hear? Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. See? What did l tell you? Smooth as silk. Yeah, except the cop's got a record of this vehicle now. Which is rented to Arthur Davalos, who doesn't exist. ( starts engine) Let's go. ( patrol car starts ) - Take her into the back room. - l'm not going to try to get away. - Take it easy. - Do yourself a favor, shut up! - ( Candy sobs) - Brad: Shut up! ( groans ) This will be over before you know it. ( gasping) My throat... Can l get some water, please? Tell Walt to move the van where it can't be seen from the road. - Good thinking. - ( _ipper runs ) ( coughs ) l'm gonna lift your head so you can drink. Hey, hey, hey! Don't touch that stuff. l was just trying to help you, punk. You got the video stuff to worry about, this is my equipment. Leave it alone. Freddy wants you to take the van around back and put it under cover. Think you can handle that? ( groans ) What's your problem? l thought l heard something out there. ( pistol clicks ) - What's going on? - He thought he heard something. - fred: There's nobody around for miles. - What if the owners come back? The owners are dead! This place is in probate. l'm telling you that nobody is going to come here. What about that redneck sheriff that pulled us over? All right, yeah, go check it out. Hey-- keep it quiet. lf it is the law, don't do anything until you talk to me. l know the drill... boss. Walt, go with him. - Me? - Yeah. Brad: How long have you known Fred? - Since l got out, about three months. - Brad: You trust him? You spent a year in a cell with him. Don't you? l used to, now l'm reconsidering. What's that supposed to mean? l think he's way too possessive of the girl. He's just protecting our investment. lt's more than that. He's in love with Miss Movie Star Bitch. He doesn't even know her, man. Nice piece of ass changes the best of men. Fred could have a shift of loyalty at a crucial time, and that could cause some serious problems. - Somebody could get hurt. - This was supposed to be easy. l'm not really worried, 'cause there's not a problem in the world that can't be fixed. Just got to be man enough to do it. You know what l'm saying? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Let's go. ( rock music plays on radio ) Mystery solved, my dear Watson. He's just passing through. He's not going to bother us. let's get the hell out of here. How do you know he hasn't seen something he shouldn't? He wouldn't still be down there, he would've called the cops. - l don't think we can take that chance. - So, what are you going to do? Take care of things real quiet. Hey, hey--! - Jesus Christ! - ( rock music continues ) : Well, the things you've been missing, the lips you've been kissing : : Were my own... : ( grunts ) ( mutters) Shit. Problem solved! Now get your scary ass over here and help me with this body. Stupid! Shit, blood all over my fucking hand. You were gone a long time. What's up? Genius thought he heard something outside, but there was nothing there. Well, let's finish setting up. Walt, the dish. You need help with that? - Uh-- yeah, l could use your help-- - l'll do it! Hey, computer boy? Yo! Got something on your mind, pussy? No. Just taking care of business. Got a lock on the uplink. l'm really scared. Just try to be brave a little while longer. Your friend scares me. Well... just do everything we say. - Okay. Okay. - To the letter. Let's go. We got an image. Zoom in a little bit. Walt: Good, good, good. - What do you want? - Walt: Stop. Lock it in. - ( Brad clapping) - Listen, please. l swear to you guys, l don't have any money. l don't have a dime to my name. ( Brad laughs ) What?! You kidnapped me because you want to make a movie? - It's a certain kind of movie. - Oh, you got to be kidding me. Ain't no kidding. You about to be a triple X-rated movie star now. - Oh, God, no! - Here's your action and dialogue. You have a few minutes to learn it. Oh, God, you guys are all nuts! You guys are all fucking crazy! We can do this simply and quickly and then get you home safe and sound, or we can take a long time under very difficult conditions. - We just want the money, honey. - No, you don't understand. l've never done this. l'm not good at this sort of thing-- Bullshit! You're a freak in every movie you make. All the men want you, you want them to want you, and you like it! Come on! l'm just a fucking actress-- Then act like you love what l'm gonna do to you! Fuck you! l'm not doing this! Fuck you! - No! Don't! - Sit down! Oh, God! Okay, okay, okay! - Please! Please! - Okay. - Okay. - ( sighs ) l don't got time for this shit. Me and you need to talk! Watch her. Look here, Fred. You said she was down with the program. What the hell did you think she was going to say? ''Hey, fellows, great! l always wanted to make a fuck film''? Use your head. You think l would start an operation like this without having motivation insurance? l'm risking my parole, and everything else, so if this is bullshit, you better have some life insurance! 'Cause you're gonna need it. You can believe that shit, Fred. Ms. Tyler, l understand how you must feel. Really, l do. We could hardly expect you to eagerly participate, especially when you are in fear for your life. So to help motivate you, l arranged for a good friend of mine named Jimmy, to get a job at the Green Meadows Rest Home. Why would you do that? Because your father lives there, naturally. And he is suffering from severe diabetes. lf his insulin dosage is microscopically adjusted one way or the other, he will go into insulin shock and die. What are you saying? Let's just get him on the line. You can ask him how he's... feeling. Daddy? Daddy, hi! lt's me. How are you? Daddy, do you have a new nurse? What's his name? Daddy, you do everything that Jimmy says, okay? And l'll see you, really-- Daddy, l love you! You fucking bastards! You just do what we ask you to do, and no harm will come to him. l really don't have any choice, do l? No, you never did. l love it. This wasn't the agreement. Better go have a talk with your genius. What's wrong? What the hell is wrong with you now? - Are you going to walk? - l don't want to. You know how bad l need this money, but l didn't sign off for this shit. - What shit? - No one said anything about murder! What murder?! Hidnapping is bad enough, but killing her old man? Her father is not in any danger. - What about your boy at the rest home? - It's a bluff, Walt. Didn't you hear what he said? Either get with the program, or Daddy go ''bye-bye.'' l have been known to lie to women from time to time, haven't you? ls there anything else on your mind? No, let's get this done, okay? Please. Consider this a-- undress rehearsal. Don't touch me. No! No-oo! - Stop! Get off-- - Fred: Hey! - ( Candy screams) - Get the fuck off her! - ( Candy cries) - l was just warming her up. lf you got a complaint, file it with the FCC, punk. We are doing this according to a script and you are gonna stick to the plan! You got it? What are you gonna do? Shoot me? Are you two going to tango, or do you want to make some money here? l guess that's up to Ms. Tyler. l'll do what you want me to do. - But l get to choose with who. - You're not in control here. l know you have my dad, but l don't know if l can do this unless l choose the man! Choose. Him. Fine. You could be on the camera. Please. lf you try to get away l might not be able to stop him. l won't try to get away. This has to be convincing. You know what's at stake, right? - Okay. - Brad: Yeah, don't get cute. Say exactly what's written down and nothing else. Believe me, l have all the motivation that l need. Look, the camera is rolling. l'll give you what you want, okay? Good. Put this on. ( laughs ) Walt: The biggest potential audience in Net history. Showtime! Hi. l'm Candice Tyler. For years, all you loyal fans out there have enthusiastically supported me. Now it's time that I return the favor by giving you what you've always demanded. More of me. I want to return the affection to all of you at the same time. l want you to meet my surrogate lover. See, his face is covered, because-- it's not really him who will be making love to me. But all of you, through him. No trick photography, no editing-- the real thing. Live, on the Net, one hour from now. - Make sure you tell all your friends. - Yeah! lt's a date l don't want anyone to miss. l promise l will hold nothing back. And l promise to each and every one of you, l will bare all. - ( gasps) - Yeah! Wow! - Yeah! - Oh-hh! ( laughs ) So... go to this site one hour from now... have your credit card ready for the nominal se_ice charge ofjust 10 dollars, To get your own private access code to a loving session of lust... with me. - ( laughs) - Wow. That was great! You were great! That was hot. That was blazing. Don't be ashamed. You're just doing what you have to do. Come on. l'm gonna have her one way or another. You can put money on that. You have... blood on your shirt. We've got about an hour before the netcast. - Would you mind not tying me up? - No. lf Walt or Brad come in, you need to be secured. Come on. Get on the bed. Hey, hang in there. Are you sure your friends are going to go along with this, honey? Baby, if l dangle the chance of a million dollars in front of these guys, they're gonna do anything l want. As long as they think that they're in control, right? lf you act it, they will come. Don't buckle on me, we can do this, okay? Okay. l love you. How is it going? Your buddy snapped, man, you never should've brought him. Sometimes you need a bad son of a bitch along to make a plan go smooth. - He's doing okay. - No, he's not. He's dangerous. And he's gonna bring a lot of shit down on us, l'm telling you. You're wrong, Walt. He's a thief. He's a high-line pro. He might be a little too machoed up, but l've never seen him snap. Look, l don't want to argue about it, okay? He's your friend. Heep him on a short leash, and way far away from me, okay? Please? You just do your job. l'll watch Brad. - Watch me do what? - Watch you light the candles. What do l look like, an altar boy? You light them. ( laughs ) l've been a real prick, haven't l, the way l'm bossing you around. l'm sorry, Brad. l will consider it a major favor if you just chalked it up to nervousness. - It's all right. - l'm glad to hear you say that. l'm just trying to be efficient at getting you one million dollars. And l'll tell you what... from now on, if you don't like doing what l ask, no hard feelings. l would just tell Walt to shut down that uplink, and we will all just go the fuck home. Nobody ain't going nowhere until my money is in the bank. l'm glad to hear you say that, because we've come a long way together. l appreciate your cooperation. - Who's there? - Don't worry, l won't hurt you. - Please, don't. - l'm not going to. - No. - l promise. - l'm not like the others. - Yeah, right. l'm not doing this for myself. l have a son-- he has a tumor and he needs an operation. l just wanted you to know that. l know what we're doing to you is wrong, but l-- l had no choice. My hand is so numb... my left hand-- l can't feel it. Oh-hh! - Is that better? - Yeah. All right, l just-- l can't believe like l am actually sitting here near-- l've seen all your movies. Congratulations, now you get to make one of your own. - That's not-- - It's great. ( crying) l'm so sorry! l hope one day you can forgive me. ( sobs) No! No... Yeah, that's it. Turn it up. Female reporter: Famous movie star Candice ryler appeared live on the Internet promising to perform explicit sex acts for her loyal fans. Oh, spin city! Ha, ha! Ms. Tyler's agent reached by phone moments ago said, ''This is someone's idea of a very sick joke.'' His client is being ''impersonated.'' But a member of our news staff that inte_iewed Ms. Tyler last month says it actually appears to be the actress, known for her sexually taunting roles in several recent thrillers. Representatives from around the gIobe are actively trying to track down the source of this mysterious netcast. And the key word in that sentence is ''trying.'' ...story become available to us. Live from HSHT News. Dana Russell. Back to you. What did l tell you? All the free publicity we can get! That's exactly what we need. We're committing a felony-- Hey! l want every horny son of a bitch in the world to see this. Because that-- is our score. l'll try to make this as pleasant as possible. Just go with the flow. Just try to forget how you got here. Relax. You might even find this pleasant. l'm gonna sit you on the bed. Need anything to eat or drink? No. Let's just do this. We're almost ready. Walt: Back on the server, it's encrypted and protected. Transfer program is... on. Every time we get a debit we'll hear a beep. - Why don't l hear no beeps? - Just give it a minute. Give it a minute? lt's only a minute till we get started. Shouldn't somebody have logged on? Yeah. - Maybe you're being blocked. - There's no indication. - Where the hell's the money?! - l don't know! Everybody just calm down. All right, look, my friend, something's wrong. l want you to think hard and go over your procedures again. l'm telling you-- there's nothing wrong. l'll go back, but-- This whole operation is done. - Well, then we cut our losses. - And her? No. We take her home. How do you know they're not on to us? What if this asshole doesn't know? They could be at her house waiting for us right now. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. - There's an easier way. - Don't even fucking think about it, or it's gonna be your brains all over the wall. Got that? You got to learn how to relax, my friend. lt's healthier. Ha! There it is! It wasn't my mistake. lt just wasn't registered. Take a look at-- that! This is going to work! Get over there and lock down the full-shot camera. This is about worshipping you. Remember that. That's bullshit. lt's about the finest tits and ass l done seen in a long time. Go back to your camera. Or what? Five seconds! Four, three... two, and... Showtime! Hi! l'm so glad you could make it. l've been fantasi_ing about this for so long. What it would feel like... your hands all over my body. My tongue all over yours. Are you ready? l am. This is for all of you. l love you. ( moans ) ( hip-hop music playing ) Ooh, damn... Yeah, my turn next. ( moaning ) Hee, hee... ( moaning increases ) ( sighs ) That was an incredible performance. l didn't know you had it in you. lt was like art. - My turn. - Don't touch me! Hey! Hnock it off. ( chuckles) Oh, what? l ain't good enough for you? Huh? Guys? Am l reading that right? Does that say 13 million... 396 thousand... 760? ( laughs ) - Can l go home now? - Not just yet. When? After dark. It'll be safer for us. l'll just tie her back up, you know? Because we don't want her seeing everything. No. l'll tie her back up. Come on, sweetie. lt's over four million dollars apiece. What are you going to do with all that money? Take care of my family. Hey, hang in there. ls anyone on our trail? No way. l pulled this up before anybody could get a handle. Well, then, congratulations, gentlemen. We are rich sons of bitches. - So, how do we get paid? - Walt, tell him. Well, it's all set up on offshore accounts, equally divided, of course. What you need to know now is the password. So what's the password? ''Let's fuck Brad out of his share''? Where is this coming from? From the fact that you got my money locked up somewhere, and l want so see it in my hand! The password is a series of randomly selected numbers by the computer. Everything you need to know about that account is-- right here on this disk. ls that so? You should be more trusting, my friend. We're partners. l'm gonna start hauling shit out of here. Walt: l can't believe we pulled this off. We haven't. Look, man, after today we never have to see each other ever again. You can live anywhere in the world you want. That should make you feel safe enough. lt should, but it doesn't. Man, would you get on with it? No one is trying to screw with you. Especially you, right? l know what you're all about. And l don't like you. Let's clean up this crap and get the hell out of here, all right? That's exactly what l'm trying to do. The slut? She got to go. She doesn't even know who we are. We're ex-convicts. lt's all the police need to put us away for a long time. You back my plan, you live to get to spend what you made here today. Get in my way, or say word one to Fred about this... it's all gonna come crashing down around you, l promise you that! Get the gun. Did you know he was going to try to take us all out? l've known this son of a bitch for 15 years! l know what he's gonna do before he does. - He killed a guy in the woods. - Yeah? That must've been the blood that l saw on his shirt. Yeah. - What do you want me to do? - Help me drag him out. l'm going to check on the girl. - She's scared shitless. - She's not the only one. Well, you got the gun, you watch him. - l'll load the van. - Then what? We whack him. lt's him or us, Walt. - Fred: You are fucking dead! - ( Candy screams ) ( grunting ) Oh! l changed my mind. You ain't even good for that. ( Candy whimpers ) l told you l wasn't like the others. Come on. Let's go. l've been to prison twice. l'm not going for a third time. l'm giving you a chance to get out of here. But l am gonna get that money for my kid. The keys are in it-- go! Just go! You don't have to shoot anybody. ( mimics buzzer) Wrong. One problem down, one problem to go. Let's get this shit settled. You're the baddest bitch on the block in the movies, but l'm the real thing. Too bad we didn't get to finish what we started, though. l'm hurt. We could finish right now. You're just trying to save your famous ass. Of course l am. Oh, come on! You know l'll do anything you want me to just so l can live. So can't we just work something out, hmm? So that you can have the money, and me? lf you try anything-- Oh! Bullshit don't work on me. How fucking stupid do you think l am? Prem fucking stupid! - ( gunshot pops) - ( Candy gasping ) - ( flies buzzing) - ( screams ) You're fucking up, Candy. The longer you put this off, the worse it's going to be for you. You wanna play with me, bitch?! Well, let's play then! l know you're in here somewhere. Can't hide from me, Candy. ( metaI cIangs ) This shit is gonna hurt, Candy! - So is this! - ( groans ) ( van engine starts ) ( moaning ) This is Candice Tyler. l've been kidnapped. l need help now! l'm at the Four Star Ranch. Please hurry, okay? - l thought you were dead! - Yeah, l thought l was dead too. This son of a bitch really laid my face open. Baby! Oh! You-- you said you could handle everything. - l didn't want to end up like this. - Oh, baby, l'm so sorry. Everything just blew out of control. But it's all right. Everything is all right. We're gonna be fine. We're gonna be all right. ( laughs ) Fred, you fuck! You two were on this together the whole time! We've known each other for a year. She needed money and a boost to her career. She came up with this con. All l did was fill in the blanks. l'm so damn proud of you! This is real jailhouse shit. Where do a piece of shit like you meet a classy ho like that, anyway? When l got out of the joint, l got a 300-dollar-a-day habit. And we met in rehab. And by the time we got clean, we hooked up. What the hell did you need me for? Well, we had to make it Iook convincing. You see? She wouldn't have a career to go back to if anybody knew that she did this voluntarily. And there is not a doubt in my mind that you would've blackmailed us for our part of the take if you knew she was in it from the start. See, we had to make it look as real as we could. ( laughs ) l needed Walt for all that techno-computer stuff, but you-- l just needed you to fill a body bag. You see, the cops got to blame somebody. And you are tailor-made for the part. ( police siren wails ) What the hell are the cops doing here? Deputy: Everybody, hands in the air! - You-- drop that gun! - Candy: Help me! - You, drop the gun! Drop it! - Fred: Hey! Candy! - Drop it! - ( gunshot ) - ( sobbing) - Come on, let's go. Watch your head. Dispatch, l have the victim in custody, l need backup and ambulances immediately. We're talking with actress Candice Tyler about her amazing story of survival. As everyone now knows, she was kidnapped and forced to have sex on the Internet. - Welcome, Candice. - Thanks, Adrian. ls it true that you recently refused to sell the movie rights - about your remarkable story? - That's right. l did. - Why not? - l feel it's too exploitational. Well, now that you're a millionairess from your multi-picture Hollywood deal, l suppose your rumored financial difficulties are very much over. Well, those rumors were false. l am so curious because-- in your police statement, you spoke glowingly - about one of the kidnappers. - Yes. l believe his name was Walt Gearson. Some people are absolutely puzzled as to why you called him a hero. Walt participated in the kidnapping because-- of his tremendous love for his wife and son. He had a change of heart, and sacrificed his life helping me escape. And l suppose that's why you paid for an operation for his son? That takes an inordinate amount of courage. And l have to tell you, you are just truly a remarkable woman. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. ( computer beeping ) l am remarkable. ( music pIaying )
