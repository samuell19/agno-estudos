Boys. This is the holy hour of the Sonnenwende. To the boys of Adolf Hitler. This hour can have but one meaning. At this hour when the earth is closest do the sun. When it is consecrating itself to the sun. We have only one thought. We too must be close to our sun. We too must consecrate our lives to our sun. And the sun that shines for us. Is Adolf Hitler. Attention! You will repeat after me the oath of allegiance to our Fuhrer. I consecrate my life to Hitler. I consecrate my life to Hitler. I am ready to sacrifice my life for Hitler. I am ready to sacrifice my life for Hitler. I am ready to die for Hitler. I am ready to die for Hitler. My saviour. My Fuhrer. My saviour. My Fuhrer. [ Professor Nichols narrates: ] "Yes." "These are Hitler's children." "It's a little hard to believe when you see it for the first time." "It was hard for me too." "Because when I first saw traces of it back in 1933." "Berlin was still a fairly pleasant place." "True, there had been some unpleasant moments." "But on a nice spring day like this." "You could tell yourself that many of these disturbances were purely local." "After all, the bands were still playing the parks." "People could still laugh and smile." "And the beer was wonderful." "On a day like this." "Even I could walk along and tell myself that things would work out somehow." "Yes. You could tell yourself many things on a day like this." "Until .." Boys! Boys, stop this fighting. Sam, get back in school. Go ahead. Let go of me. Give me back that bat. Give it back to me. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Anna. I'm surprised at you. They started it, Mr Nichols. I knocked out a good three-bagger. Stop it, boys. Stop this fighting! Dr Schmidt. Dr Schmidt. - Yes, Professor Nichols? I'm afraid someone may be hurt if this keeps up. Would you call your boys off and I'll do the same with mine. Really, Professor Nichols. Surely it is not my duty to interfere with a popular demonstration? A popular demonstration? Very well. If you won't step in I will have to. Achtung! You will stop this fighting at once and fall in. Achtung! Sorry I had to steal your stuff Dr Schmidt. Forward march. Alright, boys and girls. Back in to school. You've had enough recreation for today. I'd like my bat back if you don't mind. Suppose I do mind? If you boys insist on another popular demonstration just say so. Here is your bat. Thanks. - What is your name? I don't give it to strangers. "Well, that is how it all began." "A boy a girl and an argument." "But it didn't end there for either of them." The so-called Polish corridor. At Danzig. We must observe, boys .. And remember. We must let this humiliation burn deep into our memories. Germany was robbed in the Treaty of Versailles. By her enemies. Robbed of land which has always been and always will be. Holy German soil. But the day comes when our force of arms recovers for us this Holy German soil. Every inch of it. And more. Much more. Tenfold more. For, today we rule Germany. Tomorrow we rule the world. We shall rule because it is our glorious destiny to rule. We shall conquer as no nation can stand before the flame of our righteous anger. Nice shot. [ School bell ] Saved by the bell. Anna, you are too good for me. - I was just lucky. Alright, boys. Geography class. Let's step on it. Gee, Nicky. Do we have to go inside? Couldn't we study it just as well out here? It wouldn't be any trouble and it is spring. Please Nicky, huh? Alright. I know when I am licked. - Come on, fellahs. But you had better be good or inside we go. We have not chosen to rule. We have not voted to rule. It is our birthright to rule. It is as fixed and unalterable as the fact .. That the lion in the jungle rules by his courage. His strength. His heritage. So you see, there is just so much land no matter how you cut it up. Which brings us to the question of .. Well, suppose you tell me. I've done enough talking. Anna? Well .. suppose Germany does need room to grow in? Does that mean she can keep on grabbing everything she wants forever? No. But it certainly proves that your old League Of Nations is through. It never did work and it never will. Is that so, professor? Everybody had better unite pretty soon or everybody goes under even sooner. Or we could let everybody mind his own business couldn't we? Oh no, that is where you are wrong. The whole world is everybody's business now. And either we all take care of it together .. Why do you think we'd be better at running the world than the Germans? Who said anything about running the world? Sure. And only the Germans stand above this spawn of the servile races. We shall avenge. Avenge. And avenge. And if we are good soldiers. We shall reap the highest reward possible. And what is that? Karl. We shall win the true crown of glory like the knights of old. We shall die for Germany. We shall rest forever on Holy German soil as conquering heroes of the Fuhrer. To die for Adolf Hitler is to live for Germany. Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Detail. Halt! You will report for party duties immediately. Do not linger. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Forward. March. "Yes. The party planned for everything in the life of a good young Nazi." "Everything except the moment when a girl might be playing a piano." "And a boy might be interested." Hello. You shouldn't be seen over here. What would Dr Schmidt say and dear Mr Schicklgruber? "Well, Anna was right." "He had no time to waste on a pretty Amerikaner while the Party waited." "And yet there was something about Anna." "That made him feel like smiling deep down inside." "Oddly enough, it didn't improve the relations between the two schools." "In fact." "Matters seem to get worse." "Hardly a day went by without a clash of some kind." "I couldn't understand it all until one afternoon." Sorry to trouble you Herr Professor but we do not have First Aid at our school. That is we do not have as much medicine as we might. I mean .. - Of course. Come in. Sit down. She plays very well. For a girl. Well, I'll get something for that cut. You are not mad at the piano too, are you? You play very well .. for a girl. Is that Beethoven you are playing? You could have ducked when I threw that hockey stick. Why didn't you? I used to play the piano once. You're a funny one alright. Why are you always fighting with us all the time? I'm not fighting now. Am I? I can't figure you out. What are you doing here anyway? I came because I like to hear you play. More like you played the other day. Like this? Yes. Like that. You know, sometimes you don't sound like a German at all. That could be. I was born in America. Then you are an American? No. I am a German, and I'm proud of it. That is a strange coincidence. I was born in Germany. You were? - Yes. But I am an American. Proud of that too. If you are an American, what are you doing in Germany now? My parents loved Germany. They wanted me to love it too. So they sent me here to live with my grandparents for a while. Mom and Dad are still in New York. But how is it that you go to this American school? My parents wanted to be sure I would come back an American. Do you really want to be an American? Want to be? Listen, my friend. I am an American and if you have any objections .. Please. Don't you think we've broken enough hockey sticks? For one day I mean. There you are, Karl. Stay where you are. By the way, Karl. Did you ever read Charles Lamb's essay on roast pig? Roast pig? - Yes. Mr Lamb tells us that the ancient Chinese were not allowed to eat pig. One day Ho-Ti, a farmer. Had a fire in his house. And a pig was caught in it somewhere. So the neighbours saw that each time he rebuilt the house it burnt down again. And always there was a pig caught in it somewhere. Evidently Ho-Ti liked roast pig. That reminds me, Karl. How would you like to go on a picnic with us this Saturday? A picnic? - Yes. Then you wouldn't have to burn the house down quite so often. "And so the street fights stopped and the picnics began." "About every other Saturday Karl managed to slip away with us." "And we all got to know each other much better." "In the lovely hill country south of Berlin." And so he dreamed all his life that he might find the perfect moment. And toward the end of his days he summed up his dream like this: "if the whole world I once could see on free soil stand." "With the people free." "Then to the moment might I say." "Linger a while." "So fair thou art." Gee, that is beautiful. That would be a wonderful moment, wouldn't it. It is good poetry .. but who would want the whole world to be free? It would never work. The world has never had a chance to try it, Karl. But the dream is growing. The same poet expressed it in a simple line. "And those who live for their faith." "Shall behold it living." Those who live for their faith. Shall behold it living. Nah. It is much too fanciful. It almost put me to sleep. A little splash of cold water on my face and .. I'll prove to you whether that American prophet of yours was just a dreamer. But he is not an American, Karl. It is by a German author named Goethe. About a German hero named Faust. Forgive me, Nicky. I'm a dunce. I should be thrown in the brook. Anything to oblige a guest. Anything. Karl. Karl! Anna. What's the matter? Where are you? Over here, Karl. Quick. Anna. Anna, what are you doing? Help Karl, quick. Someone has tied the boy up and left him. Leave him alone, Anna. What are you saying? I said leave him alone. It's none of our business. You must come away quickly. Are you crazy? Don't you see this boy is in pain? Listen to me Anna and try to understand. I said this is none of our business. Look. Even the boy is trying to tell you. Please comrade. Tie me up again and put the gag back in my mouth. It is only a game. I was a spy and I was caught. And this will teach me not to get caught again. But how long have you been here? Only a few hours. It is nothing. How old are you? I am ten, Fr?ulein. And if I come through this test well I shall be taken into the Jungvolk soon. Thank you, comrade. And now if you will be so good as to replace the gag. Heil Hitler. Anna. Anna, wait for me. "That was the last we saw of Karl for a long time." "He was swept up in the storm." "The storm that was sweeping through all of Germany." [ Hitler ] "The German Reich." "Does not prepare for war." "The German Reich prepares for peace." [ Newsreel ] "October 1933." "Germany withdraws from League of Nations." [ Hitler ] "I assure France." "That she need not fear." "Now or ever for her national security." [ Newsreel ] "March 1936." "Germany marches into the Rhineland." [ Hitler ] "But to you comrades, I say." "With the return of the Rhineland." "The German Reich has no more territorial demands." "To make upon you." [ Newsreel ] "March 1938." "Germany marches into Austria." [ Hitler ] "We come to Austria not as tyrants." "But as liberators." [ Newsreel ] "October 1938." "Germany marches into Czechoslovakia." [ Hitler ] "We give to Czechoslovakia." "The hand of fellowship." "We assure the world, peace in our time." [ Newsreel ] "May 1939." "Germany signs military and political alliance with Italy." "Germany makes demands on Poland." [ Hitler ] "We have no quarrel with England." "We have no quarrel with France." "We are a new Germany." "And we shall bring to the world." "A new order!" [ Nichols ] " A new order of things was underway." "The fires of freedom were burning lower." "But although things grew more tense all around us." "At the American school the fires are banked high." "It is memorial day." "And we all gathered to celebrate it." "That is Anna you are looking at now." "She is all of twenty and the best assistant I ever had." That this nation under God. Shall have a new birth of freedom. And the government of the people .. By the people. For the people. Shall not perish from the earth. [ Singing ] "My country, 'tis of thee." "Sweet land of liberty." "Of thee I sing." "Land where my fathers died." "Land of the pilgrim's pride." Attention! The singing will stop at once. Shush them. Professor Nichols. What seems to be the trouble, Sergeant? The Ministry of Education requires the instant dismissal from your school .. Of all Poles, all Jews, all Lithuanians and all persons of German blood. This is an American school, Sergeant. We accept anyone who comes .. - I know nothing about that. Those whose names I read will fall out at once in the centre. Klein. Sara. Kolvak. Martin. Rocheck, Stephan. Horowitz, Morris. M?ller. Anna. M?ller. Anna. My name is Miller. I am a Miller. But I am not a student. I am a teacher here. Do you live with Mr and Mrs Max M?ller, K?nigstrasse 137? Yes of course. They are my grandparents. They're German but I am an American. - Nevertheless, you must fall out too. Sergeant, Miss Miller is an American citizen. I refuse .. I have my orders. If you have objections take them up with the Lieutenant. Very well. Where do I find the Lieutenant? Follow me. You too. Schnell. Schnell. Lieutenant. I demand to know by what authority these students are being removed from school. By the authority of the Gestapo. Is that sufficient? Not in an American school. The orders do not concern Americans but only Jews, Poles and Lithuanians. We are also removing all persons of German blood immediately. There are no Germans in this school. You employ Fr?ulein Anna Mueller here. Karl. Karl Bruner, don't you remember us? The German Reich decides where and how Germans can best employ their abilities. There must be some mistake, Lieutenant. I am an American. You were born in Germany, Fr?ulein? Yes. Your parents were also born in Germany? Yes. The record is quite clear, Fr?ulein. We shall be pleased to look upon you as a citizen the German Reich. Aren't you again overlooking the fact that this girl is American? Her parents became citizens of the United States. She's here on an American passport. - You are in Germany under German law. Whoever is born in Germany is a citizen of the Reich while on German soil. That is rather new and arbitrary isn't it? Arbitrary? The professor implies it is not an honor to be a citizen of the German Reich? It is undoubtedly a great honor. For Germans. But the American embassy may have another opinion about Americans. You may do as you wish about that, Herr Professor. You will bring Fr?ulein M?ller with you. Please, Nicky. - You will come with me. Don't worry, Anna. I'll straighten out. I'll go down to the embassy immediately. But surely, under international law. There is very little law being recognised here, Professor. Other than the laws of Hitler. I've got to find some way of helping that girl. I've got to. We will protest again to the German government. But I'm afraid I must warn you not to expect too much. "It was difficult to know where to turn now." "But I couldn't stop." "I tried to reach Anna by mail." "Over and over again." "I called on friends." "Party officials." "Then, in desperation it came to me that Anna's grandparents may know something." Yes? It is Professor Nichols, Mr M?ller. Don't you remember me? Yes, but please go away, Nichols. We do not know anything. Mr M?ller, I must find out something about Anna. Please, not so loud, Herr Nichols. I beg you. It is better if no-one sees us talking. You have got to tell me what you know. Well, she came here that afternoon for some things and .. Then they took her away. She said she would be alright. She said we should not worry. I'm trying to find out where she is. I want to do something about her. Do something? What can anyone do? Well, at least you have the right to ask. No no. One must never ask questions. Mr and Mrs Rumann down the street. They asked some questions about their grandson. He was in the army. They took the Rumanns away. They said they were sick. Very sick. They never came back. Yah. Yah. They .. they said they died in hospital. But I know. They put them to sleep in the hospital. - Mama. They put them to sleep with gas! - Mama, Mama. They murdered them because they were too old. Mama, Mama. "Fear." "It was the same wherever I turned." "Some terrible dread that froze people wherever they stood." "I thought I had exhausted every possibility." "Then I remembered Franz." "Franz Erhart." "If anybody could help me I was sure it would be Franz." "A brilliant courageous journalist who was respected by all." "He was in touch with everybody and everything that happened in Germany." "Yes. Franz would help me." Nicky. Well, this is a fine surprise. Franz, I've got to speak to you about something. It's important. Oh, please. If you don't mind. I think it's better we talk out here. My boys are home this morning. Two fine boys. But what they don't know they don't tell their troop leader. Franz. You mean you can't talk in your own house in front of your own children? Why of course I can, my friend. Who said I couldn't? I merely said it was wiser not to. Well, my friend. What can I do for you? I'm in trouble. They've take Anna away. Well now, who took her away? - The Gestapo. I'm sorry, my friend. I can do nothing for you. Franz, we can't let a girl disappear without doing something. Shush. Good morning, nurse. - Good morning Herr Erhart. Good morning, boys. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Observe how carefully the state takes care of even the janitor's children. Well, Hans. What do you want to be when you grow up? I shall be a leader of storm troopers. And you, Fritz? I am going to be a flier. I shall drop bombs on Germany's enemies. Very good. All is well here. Please. - Yes? Things are so difficult. My husband works so hard and earns so little. We have so many debts. There, there. You have nothing to worry about. Remember Frau Lenner. When you have your fifth child you won't owe the state anything. You won't have to pay back the money the state loaned you to get married on. The debt will be automatically cancelled. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Poor Mrs Lenner. My friend, if you think what you have just seen .. And the fact that I can't even talk in my own house is unusual. It is happening in every house and every street in Germany. And my friend it is only child's play. That is no pun. It is only child's play to what is about to happen. Franz, how can you stand it? You of all people. How can you be so complacent? My friend, you can get off a train before it starts or after it stops. But while it is in motion I wouldn't advise it. You mean you pretend to believe in this and go on writing in praise of it? What would you have me do? I wouldn't make a very good hero. I don't even make a good Nazi. They don't approve of me either. But I don't suppose you'll help me. Help you, my friend? I can't even help myself. Nicky. In such cases they usually send the girls to the Labor Camp at Rheinsberg. Is it a prison? - A prison? Oh no. It is an honor for German boys and girls to go to Labor Camps. To build themselves to be fit for their duties as soldiers and mothers. I shouldn't be too hard to arrange an escape. I might get her out of Germany. My friend, that would be a very unwise thing to attempt. Can I get permission to visit the camp? - You couldn't. Well, an American schoolteacher. It is possible he might get permission from the Ministry of Education .. To make a tour of the camps. Thanks, Franz. - Yah. I will take up the matter with the various departments, Professor Nichols. You know, Professor Nichols. Not many foreign educators seem interested in our methods. Perhaps they are afraid they might approve. Well, I'm sure after reading your book on the subject. They'll form a different impression. Thank you very much, Professor Nichols. Good morning, Colonel. Oh, Colonel. May I see you moment? Colonel Henkel, may I present Professor Nichols. How do you do. The Colonel is from the Gestapo but he is an educator too. A Rhodes Scholar. Oxford. And the Colonel's aide, Lieutenant Bruner. Do you know each other? - Yes, sir. I had charge of a detail that removed foreigners from the American school. Yes, of course. The Professor is eager to gain permission to visit our Labor Camps. He is interested in studying our new education methods. Good. I must say Professor, I admire the spirit of your enquiry. I sometimes think it would be interesting to go back to Oxford. For a similar investigation. There would be so many surprises in store for my English friends. I'm sure there would. - Since the Colonel seems to approve .. I'm sure we should have permission for you within a few days, Professor. Thank you, gentlemen. Coming, Karl? Professor Nichols. Yes? - You will come with me. Just a minute, officer. What's this all about? You will come with me. You will tell Dr Graf and Colonel Henkel that you've changed you mind about .. Your educational tour. Why? I know you are searching for Anna. You must give it up. Do you understand? - No. I don't understand. There are death penalties for many acts against the German Reich, Professor. I didn't know you were interested in my health. I'm not, I assure you. I was merely thinking of Anna's welfare. You certainly proved that when you sent her to a Labor Camp. A girl who never did anything physically harder than play a piano. She is not in the Labor Battalions. Through my influence she was able to get a position of trust on the staff. So that is why you didn't expose me to Colonel Henkel. You will leave Colonel Henkel out of this. It's surprising to know that a good Gestapo officer .. Is interested in a girl who believes in freedom. It may surprise you to know that Anna's attitude to the new Germany is changing. And you are afraid I might re-infect her with my American ideas? I have no fear of that. Blood calls to blood. And German blood runs deep. But if you persist in this search you simply endanger her position and yours. And perhaps yours? I warn you, Professor Nichols. - It's no use, Karl. I won't give up this search and I won't believe what you say until I see her. And I don't care what the penalties are. Suppose that I could prove to that she is happy and well off where she is now? If you could prove it. Yes. Good afternoon, Herr Lieutenant. - Good afternoon, Frau Weigele. This is Professor Nichols of the American school. How do you do. We wish to be shown the camp. - Of course, Lieutenant. May we have Fr?ulein M?ller as our guide? We shall be honored. She is one of our best girls. Anna M?ller. You know Lieutenant Bruner of course. This is Professor Nichols of the American Colony school. How do you do, Professor. The Lieutenant requests you show him and Professor Nichols round the camp. I shall be glad to. If you will come this way please. Lieutenant Bruner. How nice to see you. Good afternoon, Matron. Anna. I've been trying to find you for months. - Nicky, it is so wonderful to see you. I've got to talk quickly. I'm arranging plans for your escape from here. We'll get you out of Germany through the underground. No Nicky. We can't think of it. Don't worry, Anna. We planned it carefully. There won't be any danger. But you don't understand. I want to be here. Anna, you are playing a game. It isn't necessary. I understand. I'm not afraid of the risk. I am quite happy here. I am just beginning to realize .. If you will both follow me please. Finally Professor, this is the Rest Home. Here the girls receive the finest attention the state can provide. Despite foreign propaganda. You can see that these Labor Camps are not prisons. There are no walls. You mean these girls are here voluntarily? They are drafted to serve just as men are in the army. And they serve just as proudly. - You will observe, Professor. The Rest Home contrasts considerably with the other sections of the camp. As you have seen they work hard and live simply. To fit them for their duties for to state. The only recreation provided is the Saturday night dance. There, lovers may meet. And decide to share the experience that makes them worthy of the Fuhrer. When the girls come here .. Nothing is considered too good for those whose children will belong to the state. Even if they are illegitimate? - Does that shock you, Professor? We've put aside these old superstitions. The girls of the new Germany are proud to rear their children for Hitler. Does the state also offer them the alternative of a home and a husband? Perhaps talking to one of the girls will answer that, Professor. Magda, this is Lieutenant Bruner and Professor Nichols. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Magda. Do you feel you'd rather have a husband and a home than what you have here? Why should I? I shall have a child for the state and for the Fuhrer. Isn't that much nobler than having a child just for a home and a husband? Aren't you afraid? Afraid? Do you know what I am hoping? I hope I shall have much pain when my baby is born. I want to feel that I am going through a real ordeal. For our Fuhrer. The state is very proud of you, Fr?ulein. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. We've lost Professor Nichols. Yes. We have lost Nicky. Anna. I can't tell you how glad I am to see you begin to understand our way of life. Thank you, Herr Lieutenant. And now I must return to my work. Wait a minute. I have something to tell you. Because of the fine reports on your work here. I recommended you for special study in geopolitics at the university in Berlin. It is a very great honor, Anna. It will bring us closer to each other. You must withdraw your recommendation at once. Why? Because I hate everything this place stands for. Anna. I lied to Nicky. Because there is no way out for me. And I won't have him killed trying to find one. I don't believe you. You are a German. If you'd give our way of living a fair chance .. You can't give evil and rottenness a fair chance. You don't know what you say, Anna. - Yes I do. I am saying that there is no choice between my world and yours. You are upset and disturbed because of seeing Nicky again. You've done your work well because you are a German. And slowly. Even the things you didn't understand at first are becoming clear to you. I did my work because there was no fighting it. But I warn you. I would rather die than do as you ask. It is too late to withdraw the recommendation now. You will be called to the Ministry of Education any day. I know you won't be foolish enough to refuse the offer. It would dangerous for both of us. Fr?ulein M?ller, this is a rare opportunity for you. Not every girl is invited to study geopolitics at the university. Thank you, doctor. And with your training and education, well .. Someday you might even be sent back to America. As an espionage agent, Dr Graf? No, Fr?ulein. As an ambassador of culture. An ambassador of world culture. Unfortunately, Dr Graf, I must decline the honor. What did you say, Fr?ulein M?ller? I said I don't want any part of the diseased new world you plan for mankind. And I am not afraid to die to prove it. Fr?ulein M?ller! Who said anything about dying, Fr?ulein? Let me assure you the choice is no longer between life and death. Dying my dear Fr?ulein is a luxury these days. We must all live and work. And for those who will not work with a brain. We will find duties to fit their capacity. Keep this woman in custody until we give you further instructions. Well. This young lady was allowed to come far for a person harboring such thoughts. She was recommended and vouched for by your prot?g? Lieutenant Bruner. Really? Send in Lieutenant Bruner. He must be removed at once. Why? Colonel Henkel. My dear Graf, when will you learn that we must stop purging our best people? Do you think a man who recommends that type of woman for a position of trust .. Our "best people"? - All men make mistakes. Especially young men. I dare say even you and I have made some. I feel it as much my job to save them from their mistakes and from themselves. Your attitude is inviting trouble, Henkel. Inviting trouble? Your fears are so typical of the old-line Party men, Graf. You seem to forget that the usefulness of the street corner hoodlum .. Went after we achieved power. I wish you would diminish your admiration for brute violence. If the party is to survive intelligent young men will be needed. Do you consider what he did an act of intelligence? Alright, Perhaps not. But certainly not reason enough to disqualify him. Suppose he does care for this girl. We Nazis are not opposed to such a relationships. My only question is. Will he put his interest in this girl before his duty to the state? It's too dangerous to risk waiting for an answer. [ Door knocks ] Heil Hitler. Herr Karl. You recommended a girl .. Named Anna M?ller. For work at the university. Yes, Herr Colonel. I suppose you .. Looked into her background carefully? Yes, Herr Colonel. She was born in Germany though she has lived in America. Her work at Rheinsberg was considered excellent. She is regarded as a German. Therefore, there seemed to be no reason for not advancing her as a German. That is sound enough. The young lady only a few moments ago .. Committed an act of treason against the state. In this office. I allowed a moment of sentiment to misguide me, sir. I knew her as a young girl. We went to neighboring schools. I regret it, sir. What do you think we ought to do about her? There is no alternative. She must be sent to a concentration camp. I don't think such severity will be necessary. Perhaps a year on a Labor Corps will work out these silly notions. As you wish, Herr Colonel. That will be all, Karl. Well, Graf? I still warn you it would be safer not to experiment. Henkel speaking. You have a young lady named Anna M?ller. She is being held in custody. You will transfer her from the staff to the Labor Corps at Rheinsberg. Yes. And I want a daily confidential report on her behaviour. Good. Her behaviour is becoming steadily worse. She is a dangerous agitator and no corrective measures seem effective. Alright. Thank you, Frau Ritter. Yes. If you will please. [ Door knocks ] Good morning, Karl. Good morning, sir. Congratulations. I have good news. Because of your fine work on the Tagler case I've approved a Captaincy for you. Thank you, Colonel. My only hope is to prove myself worthy of the honor. I have no fear of that. Thank you, sir. Ours is a most important calling, Karl. The Gestapo is judge, jury and prosecutor all rolled into one. And only the best minds should be permitted to administer such power. Men of great strength of character. Men to whom there is no other consideration. Than their duty to the state. That is why I have sponsored you, Karl. Thank you, sir. Good. By the way. Have you received any reports on the camp at Rheinsberg? Rheinsberg? Yes. I asked the superintended there to .. Report to me regarding the behaviour of the M?ller girl. I thought it might be interesting to follow the case. Oh, of course. Forgive me, Colonel. They have been coming in regularly with all the rest of the reports. I didn't want to bother you seeing how busy you are. Thank you. Ordinarily that might be the case. But I have a special report on the camps to make to the Ministry of Education. Which reminds me. You remember Professor Nichols? Of the American Colony school? - Yes, sir. Well, Graf and I have decided to let him make his tour of our institution. I rather liked the chap. I thought I would show him one or two places personally. Wouldn't you like to come along? - I should be honored, sir. Good. He's waiting in my office. Come on. This, Professor, is a most unusual clinic. In fact, the most unusual. One of the finest of its kind in the world. You are observing what is probably the most progressive medical advance .. Ever attempted by any government. What do you mean, Colonel? Didn't I tell you? All these patients are women. Women who are unfit to have children. They are being sterilised. May I ask why? Yes, of course, Professor. We are building a new Germany. A strong Germany. There is no room for the sick and the weak and the unstable. Who decides that? We have courts. Special courts. It is all very legal I assure you. Prepare another hypo. Of course, although the majority of our cases are the weak and the unstable .. Our doctors operate for a number of other reasons. Would you believe it, Professor. They range from eliminating hereditary color blindness .. To dangerous political thinking. In political cases it makes the woman much quieter. More reasonable. It is sometimes much kinder than putting a woman in a concentration camp. You are barbarians aren't you. Even the Rhodes Scholars among you. Well, the Professor has voluntarily ended his tour. He's fortunate I spared him the news that I was referring the M?ller girl. She was one of his students, wasn't she? Yes, Colonel. What would you do about her if you were in my place? If I were you, Herr Colonel. I should do exactly what you will do. Good boy. Well. Shall we run along? If you don't mind, Herr Colonel. I should like to watch for a little while longer. I will see you at the ministry. Let go of me, do you hear. - Quiet, you little fool. Karl. What are you doing here? I came to warn you that you are in great danger, Anna. Oh, Karl. I don't care anymore. I don't care. They can't do anything more to me that I fear. They can, believe me. You must write Colonel Henkel at once. You must say you made a grave mistake. - No, Karl. Say you are eager to serve your country. - It's not my country. It never will be. Be sensible, Anna. Ask for another chance. You will fight a storm that can overwhelm you. You have got to ride with it. As far as it goes. Is that what you have done, Karl? Please, Anna. There is no time left for discussing ideologies. You must do what I ask you now. Or you will treated as a dangerous political enemy. I've told you, Karl. I can't be frightened anymore. But you don't know what that means. I was at the Frauenklinic clinic today. I saw what happened to others. I was told it would happen to you. You will be operated on so you cannot pass your crime on to other generations. My crime? No, Karl. Even that holds no terror for me now. It's a choice between having a baby by a boy from the camp down the road or .. My darling. My darling Anna. I love you so much. I love you too, Karl. But it is too late. It was too late when it began. No, darling. No. We must only think that we love each other. Oh, Karl. Do you remember? It was so long ago. "If the whole world I once could see". "On free soil stand with the people free." "Then to the moment might I say: " "Linger awhile." "So fair thou art." Anna. I cannot let them hurt you. - There is no other way. There is one. It would protect you and it would satisfy them. The most they demand is that you have a child for the state. They never enquire who the father is. - Karl. We love each other, darling. I can't marry you now. It is impossible. But later perhaps, when things work out. - Don't you see how wrong that is? How deceitful? I only see that I love you, Anna. But it wouldn't be our child. It would be Hitler's. Just another child to die for the state. - Please, Anna. That's part of the confusion that we mustn't think about. Each generation must look out for itself. No, Karl. That is where you are wrong. That's where you and Hitler, Goering and Goebbels and all the rest are wrong. Each generation must look after the generation that comes after it. If our fathers and their fathers before them hadn't all hoped a little. Dreamed a little. And worked for the ones that came after them. Why, we would still be a pack of savages. That's the world you are working for, Karl. That is the world I won't bring a baby into. I won't give in to them. And my son and his son won't either. I won't Karl. I won't. I won't! My dear good people. I shall not speak to you this morning upon the Gospel for today. For the day of the Gospel must speak for itself. And I shall speak instead. Upon a very different gospel. The gospel according to Adolf Hitler. For the time has come, my friends. When you must choose once and for all. Between the Gospel of Christ. And the gospel of Hitler. There can be no compromise between what is right .. And what is wrong. For might does not make right. Not even though it be German might. For there is not one set of rules for Germans .. And another set of rules for the rest of the world. The rules are the same for everyone the world over. We must love the Lord our God. With our whole heart and with our whole soul. And our neighbor as our self. Now .. more than ever before. We who believe that the good life is eternal. That the grave is not the end. We must face the issue. Clearly. We solve nothing by running away from it. We must think what we live. And live what we think. And if to do that is to die .. Stop! There is a girl hiding here. You will please dismiss your congregation at once. We will stand guard at the doors as they go out. Well? You up there. Do you hear me? Tell these people to go home. And so my dear friends. If to live what I think .. Is to die for what I think. Why, then I say let me die. While I am still proud. I am a German. Ex Probis. Well Anna M?ller, who helped you escape from camp? No-one helped me escape from camp. Who helped you to get from the camp to the church? No-one helped me from the camp to the church. I .. I just got a ride, that's all. With whom? - I don't know. A farmer. I never saw him before. He didn't even know I was in his wagon. Why did you take refuge in the cathedral? Are you catholic? - No, I am not. Why did you go there of all places? Were you to meet someone there? Did someone promise to get you out of the country perhaps? I advise you to tell us all that you know. Please, Major Koepel. I assure you this young woman and I have never met before. A likely story. I tell you Major, this bishop is no better than the rest of the traitors. Even as we looked for the girl in his church .. He was denouncing the Fuhrer from the pulpit. Do you deny this, Bishop? No. I have always denounced the Fuhrer. He will bring no good to Germany. Enough! But I am no party to any conspiracy, gentlemen. Whatever I may say or whatever I may do. Is said and done in the open. Please, you must believe him. I did go to his church to hide. But it was my own idea. When I saw others might be hurt because of me .. I surrendered. [ Telephone ] Yes? Yes, Colonel Henpeck. Yes. She was apprehended a few hours ago. Good work, Major. We must make an example of her. Yes. That is a splendid idea. I will send Captain Bruner down to represent me. Oh yes, of course. Heil Hitler. Anna M?ller. You've given us a great deal of trouble. Ordinarily you would be kept in solitary confinement for an indefinite period. But under all the circumstances some different discipline is clearly needed. Tomorrow morning you will receive ten lashes witnessed by the entire camp. Major, Captain. I do not know this girl. But I must protest for her as I would for one of my own people. Has it come to this? You now whip women as well as men to create the new order in the new Germany? And after the ten lashes. Special treatment at the Frauenklinic clinic in Berlin. Courage, child. They are only trying to frighten you. I'm not afraid. I remember what you said. There are some things one cannot run away from. God bless you. God keep you. Father. Father. Father! Father! Is there nothing you madmen will stop at? I bow my head in shame that any man who calls himself a German can beat a woman. But this. This Frauenklinic clinic as you call it. Is the supreme blasphemy of all. How dare you. How dare you take away that which is not yours to take. Before God, we are all free, Major. We have certain rights which are inalienable. Certain rights which were never given to us by the state. Tell me Major, who made you? Who gave you the breath of life itself? Was it the state or was it something mightier than the state? You cannot trick me with your questions. If I must choose between Christianity or the state, I'm glad to choose the state. Christianity had its chance and failed. When the time is right we will break with it completely. Once and for all. No wonder you take away the breath of life so readily. The breath of death is already upon you. That is enough. You may go now, Bishop. Just one question more, Major. If you whip that poor unfortunate girl .. Why do you not whip me? Is it perhaps that you are afraid? Afraid? Afraid that the people who listen to me may someday rise up against you. No. We are not afraid. But there is no need to make a martyr of you before your time. Besides, when the work of National Socialism is finished. There will be no-one in the churches for the clergy to talk to. Except themselves. Good morning. What a pity barbarians have so little time for history. Tell me Major, have you ever heard of Attila? Attila the Hun? The infamous leader of the Huns who murdered his own brother Bleda. Who swept with fire and sword. Through Asia and Europe. Who ruled with bloody hands. This very land we now call Germany. Well. Attila and his barbarians have gone. But the church remains. The church remains, Major. It is eternal. It is the will of God. No man can change it. And now I shall go and offer a special prayer. For our speedy destruction. At the hands of our enemies. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Karl. - No matter what happens now. Remember I love you. I will always love you. Karl. Karl. I don't care what happens to me now. You know this is the end for both of us. - I don't care. I'm not afraid. Not now. And just once. While there is still time. I want to tell you I was wrong, Anna. Horribly wrong. - It doesn't matter. Just once again. I want to tell you how very much I love you. All the time. This isn't the moment one would choose. - But .. But to the moment might I say .. Linger awhile. So fair thou art. Franz, what have you found out? Germany and Italy have signed a military alliance. No. I mean about Karl and Anna. - Now you will see. In the fall when the crops are in. War. It has all been arranged. Franz. They will have to die of course. Is there a way to get them out? If we get shot at the border it'd be better .. Now, now my friend. We wouldn't have a chance. They are a valuable property of the New Order now. And will be guarded as such. - What do you mean? Captain Bruner has repented his sin against the state. I don't believe it. - Yes, it is true. And Colonel Henkel is very pleased. He will be able to make capital from his mistake. He will give his prot?g? a fine trial. Where Karl will beg the youth of Germany not to follow his example. I know that boy is not a Nazi at heart. No, It will be a fine trial broadcast all over the country. And at a good hour too, when everyone can hear it. Then they will give him a fine funeral with military honors. Why should he recant to cover up for Colonel Henkel? If he has to die anyhow. You Americans will never understand us. Maybe it is the will to obey that is in us Germans. How easy to march in step once you are started. Karl. Karl. Can you hear me? I have nothing to say to you, Anna. Karl. What have they done to you? I don't care what happens to me as long as you love me. Karl .. if you ever stopped loving me. I would be afraid. Really afraid. I am sorry, Anna. "I lost my head." "I didn't know what I was doing." "I cursed the day I ever met you." Well, Major? I don't know, Colonel. Remember, he fooled you once before. Well, Dr Graf. Does he hate her? Or is he trying to fool us? Pardon, Herr Colonel. I don't understand. I thought it was we who were giving him the third degree. Yah. If you really loved the girl like that .. What would you do? If I loved a girl and there were just a few hours left for both of us. I surely would tell her I loved her. - Hmm. But you offer him such big sticks, Colonel. Not only do you award him a military funeral of a patriot of Germany. But a nationwide broadcast of the trial itself. Now is that necessary? - Yes, quite necessary. If you please Colonel, perhaps you can remember that I warned .. Yes, I remember. Then must there be a broadcast? Would not a transcription do as well? No, a transcription will not do as well. People no longer believe our transcriptions. No. The memory of this betrayal. Must be wiped away by a real tremendous demonstration for the youth of Germany. Something un-staged. Unrehearsed. Something with the undying ring of truth in it. Check. It is no use Franz. I couldn't keep my mind on it. Yeah, yeah. That's alright. The trial is about to start. Aren't you going? - I have seen too many trials. This one we will listen to. [ Door knocks ] Yes? Professor Nichols? - Yes. You are very fortunate, Professor. We were able to secure space for you on the Paris plane. I wasn't aware I was leaving. - Yes you are, Professor. The plane takes off in about an hour. You should be able to make it if you pack in a hurry. Suppose I don't? Suppose I .. A warrant for your arrest as an accessory to treason .. Will be issued in the morning. No, no my friend. Softly. Someone should survive. Survive to report. For those who can report no longer. Come .. I will help you pack. Put those on the Paris plane, porter. - Jawohl. Fife minutes to spare. Can they take off in this fog? - Oh yeah, they take off alright. It will be difficult to land in this weather, but .. The air will be clearer in Paris for a while anyway. [ Tannoy ] "Today, all over Germany by permission of the Ministry of Propaganda." "We bring you the trial of Captain Karl Bruner." "And Anna M?ller." The prisoner Captain Bruner will be permitted to make an opening statement. Then, Karl Bruner. You have a right to make an opening statement if you wish. Have you anything to say for yourself? I speak today. No for myself. But for the youth of Germany. I speak as one who has learned a great lesson. Our Fuhrer. Our beloved Fuhrer. Has often said that the future belongs to youth. And that the youth belong to the future. And I know how true that is. I beg you all to be warned by my example. "I thought for a while that it would be fun to be free." To do just as I wished. I was willing to serve the Reich. But I was not willing to obey it in all things. Some things I wanted to decide for myself. Some things I said were no business of the Reich. Yes. In some things I put my will above that of the Fuhrer. From all this I have learned a great lesson. And the lesson in the words of a German poet is this: "Those who live for their faith." "Shall behold it living." "And my faith, my friends." "Is the faith of the great Goethe." "If the whole world I once could see." "On free soil stand." "With the people free." "Then, to the moment might I say .." "Linger awhile." "So fair thou art." "So fair thou art." To the youth of Germany then I say: This is my lesson. This is the lesson of life. This is not the lesson you are learning in Germany today. You're not learning the lesson of life. Your education is an education for death. You don't know how to live from day to day, but how to die from day to day. For to live is to be free. You no longer wish to be free. Have you any idea my friends what it is like to be free? Well, I'll tell you for I was a free man once. And once you've had a taste of freedom. Nobody can take it away from you. It's like a breath of fresh air that lasts to eternity. Long live the enemies of Nazi Germany! [ Gunshot! ] "Karl." [ Gunshot! ] You know my friend I had a dream last night. It was all about Napoleon and Beethoven. Please, Franz. - No, no It was a good dream. Napoleon was writing lots of speeches. Speeches about war and fighting. And at the same time Beethoven was writing lots of music. And then the dream changed, and they were dead. And many years passed. And you know what, my friend? The whole world was still playing and listening to Beethoven's music. But I didn't hear anybody reciting Napoleon's speeches. How do you explain that, my friend? Can it be possible there are some things which outlast dictators? [ Tannoy ] "Der Flug nach Hanover und Paris ist startbereit." "Abreise bitte." Goodbye Franz. - Yah, yah. [ Nichols: ] "I know what you are thinking." "You are saying to yourself .." "Franz isn't very much of a hero to carry on where Karl and Anna left off." "Maybe you are right." "But if he isn't as much a hero as he ought to be." "He isn't as much of a coward as he used to be either." "That night as I left Germany I thought lots of things weren't quite the same." "True. The fires were still burning in the hills." "And Hitler's children were still swearing to die for him." "But to me, the fires didn't seem to burn so brightly." "And the voices didn't come up quite so bravely." "And perhaps all over Germany people were beginning to ask themselves .." "The same question you must ask yourself tonight as you go home." "Can we stop Hitler's children .." "Before it is too late?" "Well, you and l at least know the answer to that question." "So long as we have boys like Karl and girls like Anna." "The light will always outshine the dark." "For, as the prophets of old used to say: " "The memory of virtue is immortal." "And we have a long, long memory." -(Ro-s)-
