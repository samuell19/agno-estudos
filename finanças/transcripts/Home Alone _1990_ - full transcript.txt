You're not ready, are you? Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me watch the movie, but the big kids can. Why can't I? Kevin, I'm on the phone. When do you come back? Not till then? It's not even rated "R."

Hang up the phone and make me, why don't ya? This kid. Kate, did you by any chance pick up a voltage adapter thing? No, I didn't have time to do that. How am I supposed to shave in France? Grow a goatee. Dad, nobody'll let me do anything. Good-bye. You wanna something to do? I've got something for you to do. Pick up those Micro Machines that are all over in there. Aunt Leslie stepped on one and almost broke her neck. He was in the garage again playing with the glue gun. Didn't we talk about that? Did I burn down the joint? I don't think so. I was making ornaments out of fishhooks. My new fishhooks? I can't make ornaments out of the old ones, with dry worm guts stuck on 'em. Peter. Come on, Kevin. Out. Peter, Kate, do you guys have a voltage adapter? Here! Here's a voltage adapter. You're getting heavy. Go pack your suitcase. Pack my suitcase? Do you know where the shampoo is, Fuller? I don't live here. I don't believe a house with this many people, there's no shampoo. Pardon me. Are your parents home? Yeah, but they don't live here. Tracy, did you order the pizza? Buzz did. Excuse me, miss. Are your parents here? My parents live in Paris. Sorry. Hi! Hi! Are your parents home? Yeah. Do they live here? No. No. Why should they? All kids, no parents. Probably a fancy orphanage. I don't know how to pack a suitcase. I've never done this once in my whole life. Tough. That's what Megan said. What did I say? You told Kevin, "tough." The dope was whining about a suitcase. What am I supposed to do? Shake his hand and say, "Congratulations, you're an idiot"? I'm not an idiot! Really? You're completely helpless! Everyone has to do everything for you. She's right, Kev. Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than you. I don't know how to pack a suitcase. I hope you didn't just pack crap, Jeff. Shut up, Linnie. Do you know what I should pack? Buzz told you, cheek-face. Toilet paper and water. Listen, Kev, what are you so worried about? You know mom's gonna pack your stuff anyway. You're what the French call les incompetents. What? Bombs away! [BANGING LOUDLY] P.S. You have to sleep on the hide-a-bed with Fuller. If he has something to drink, he's gonna wet the bed. This house is so full of people, it makes me sick! When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone! Did you hear me? I'm living alone! I'm living alone! Who's gonna feed your spider while we're gone? He just ate a whole load of mice guts. He should be good for a couple weeks. Is it true that French babes don't shave their pits? Some don't. But they got nude beaches. Not in the winter. ♪♪ [TAPE PLAYING, REWINDING] Buzz? Don't you know how to knock, phlegmwad? Can I sleep in your room? I don't want to sleep in a hide the bed with Fuller. If he has something to drink, he'll wet the bed. I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you were growing on my ass. [OBJECT CLATTERING] Check it out. Old man Marley. Who is he? You ever heard of the South Bend Shovel Slayer!? No. That's him. Back in '58, he murdered his whole family and half the people on his block with a snow shovel. Been hiding out in this neighborhood ever since. Well, if he's the Shovel Slayer, how come the cops don't arrest him? Not enough evidence to convict. They never found the bodies. But everyone around here knows he did it. Now it'll just be a matter of time before he does it again. What's he doing now? He walks up and down the streets every night, salting the sidewalks. Maybe he's just trying to be nice. No way. See that garbage can full of salt? That's where he keeps his victims. The salt turns the bodies into mummies. Wow. Mummies. Look out! [TIRES SCREECHING] [GRUNTING] How you kids doing? Good? Lot of action around here today? Going on vacation? Where you going? Do you hear me or what? Going on a trip? Where you going, kid? [KNOCKING] Okay, that's 122.50. Not for me, kid. I don't live here. You just around for the holidays? I guess you could say that. Hey, pizza's here! Here you go. That's 122.50. It's my brother's house. He'll take care of it. Hey kids, come on... Hey, listen... Hi. Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister? Yeah. The Mr. McCallister who lives here? Yes. Oh, good, 'cause somebody owes me 122.50. I'd like a word with you, sir. Am I under arrest or something? No, no. It's Christmastime. There's always a lot of burglaries around the holidays. So we're checking the neighborhood to see if everyone's taking the proper precautions. That's all. Yeah. Well, we have automatic timers for our lights, locks for our doors. That's about as well as anybody can do these days. Right! Do you get some eggnog or something like that? Come on, Dad. Let's eat. Eggnog? Listen, are you gonna be leaving... Pizza! Pizza. Pizza! Grab yourself a napkin. You're gonna have to pour your own drinks. Mom, does Santa Claus have to go through customs? What time do we have to go to bed? Early. We're leaving the house at 8:00 a.m. on the button. I hope you're all drinking milk. I want to get rid of it. Hey! Don't you dare. Honey, the pizza boy needs $122.50 plus a tip. For pizza? 10 pizzas times 12 bucks. Frank, you got the money, don't you? Come on. Traveler's checks. Forget it, Frank. We have cash. You probably got the kind of traveler's checks that don't work in France. Did anyone order me a plain cheese? Yeah, we did. But if you want any, somebody's gonna have to barf it all up, 'cause it's gone. Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi. Kev! Kevin, get a plate. [IMITATES RETCHING] [SCREAMING] Wow! The passports! Watch it! Help me out here! No, let's get these passports out of here. Kevin, get off of him! You moron! Are you okay, honey? Come here. Are you all right? What is the matter with you? He started it! He ate my pizza on purpose. He knows I hate sausage and olives and... Look what you did, you little jerk! Kevin, get upstairs right now. Why? Kevin, you're such a disease. Shut up. Kevin, upstairs! Say good night, Kevin. Good night, Kevin. Now what's for dinner? Why do I always get treated like scum? I'm sorry. This house is just crazy. We've got all these extra kids running around. My brother-in-law drove in from Ohio today. It's just nuts. How come you didn't bring more cheese pizzas? Nice tip. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Having a reunion or something? No. My husband's brother transferred to Paris last summer, and all of his kids are still going to school here, and I guess he missed the whole family. He's giving us all this trip to Paris for holidays, so we can be together. You're taking a trip to Paris? Yes, we hope to leave tomorrow morning. Excellent. Excellent. If you'll excuse me, this one's out of sorts. I'll be right back. Don't worry about me. I spoke to your husband already. And don't worry about your home. It's in good hands. There are 15 people in this house. You're the only one who has to make trouble. I'm the only one getting dumped on. You're the only one acting up. Now get upstairs. I am upstairs, dummy. The third floor? Go. It's scary up there. Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while. I don't want to sleep with Fuller. You know about him. He wets the bed. He'll pee all over me. I know it. Fine. We'll put him somewhere else. I'm sorry. It's too late. Get upstairs. Everyone in this family hates me. Then maybe you should ask Santa for a new family. I don't want a new family! I don't want any family! Families suck! Stay up there. I don't want to see you again for the rest of the night. I don't want to see you again for the rest of my life. And I don't want to see anybody else either. I hope you don't mean that. You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow morning and you didn't have a family. No, I wouldn't. Then say it again. Maybe it'll happen. I hope I never see any of you jerks again. I wish they would all just disappear. [WINDOW SHUTTERS RATTLING] [BEEPS] [KNOCKING] Where are they? I don't know. She said 8:00 sharp.

Excuse us. Come. Couldn't help but hearing you got a little bit of a dilemma there. We got a crisis ourselves. Allow me to introduce myself. Gus Polinski. How are you? Polka king of the Midwest? The Kenosha Kickers? Hi there. Hiya. No? That's okay. I thought you might've recognized...Anyways, I had a few hits a few years ago. That's why, you know... "Polka, Polka, Polka"? ♪♪ [SINGING] No? "Twin Lakes Polka." "Yamahoozie Polka, " a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka." "Polka Twist." These are songs? Yeah. Yeah. We... Some fairly big hits for us. You know, in the early '70s, you know? Yeah, we sold about 623 copies of that. In Chicago? No. Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan. I loved it. You know. I'm sorry. Did you say you could help me? Anyway, I'm done rambling on here. Our flight was canceled, so we gotta drive. So, see the guy in the yellow jacket over there by the Budget sign? He's gonna rent us a nice, big van and we're gonna drive to Milwaukee. I heard you had some problems here, getting to Chicago to see your kid or something? My son. He... We left and he's there. Aw, geez. If you have to get to Chicago, we'll gladly drive you. It's on their way to Milwaukee. You'd give me a ride? Sure we will. Why not, you know? You gotta get home and see your kid. A ride to Chicago? Sure. You know, it's Christmastime. Thank you. Oh, thank you. If you don't mind going with some polka bums. No, I'd love to. [SNORING] Hey, Marv, Marv. What? Look at this. I think we're getting scammed by a "kindygartener." [CHUCKLES] [GASPS] Dad, can you come here and help me? Remember that kid we saw the other day? He lives here. Well, if the kid's there, the parents gotta be. He's home alone. You gotta be kidding. You wanna come back tonight? Even with the kid here? I don't think that's a good idea, Harry. Hey, look. That house is the only reason we started working this block in the first place. Ever since I laid eyes on that house, I wanted it. So let's take it one step at a time, okay? We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite to eat. We'll come back about 9:00. 9:00. This way it's dark then. Yeah. Kids are scared of the dark. You're afraid of the dark too, Marv. You know you are. No, I'm not! Yes, you are. I'm not, not. You are so.

Is he still here? It's really important that I see him. He's getting in his car. I guess if you hurry, you can catch him. Damn! How low can you get? Giving Kris Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve. What's next? Rabies shots for the Easter Bunny? Santa, hold on! Can I talk to you for a minute? If you make it quick. Santa's got a little get-together he's late for. Okay. I know you're not the real Santa Claus. What makes you say that? Just out of curiosity. I'm old enough to know how it works. All right. But I also know that you work for him. And I'd like you to give him a message. Shoot. I'm Kevin McCallister, 671 Lincoln Boulevard. Do you need the phone number? No, that's all right. Okay. This is extremely important. Would you please tell him that, instead of presents this year, I just want my family back. No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate, Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff. And my aunt and my cousins. And, if he has time, my Uncle Frank. Okay? Okay. I'll see what I can do. Thanks. Wait. Hold on a second. My elf took the last of the candy canes home to her boyfriend. That's okay. No, no. Don't be silly. Everybody who sees Santa has gotta get... something. Here. Hold out your little paw there. Here you go. Don't spoil your dinner. I won't. Thanks. [ENGINE STARTS] [GEARS GRINDING] [ENGINE STALLS] Son of a... [CHATTERING] ♪♪ [WOMAN SINGING] ♪♪ [CHOIR SINGING] [GASPS] Merry Christmas. May I sit down? That's my granddaughter up there. The little red-haired girl. She's about your age. Do you know her? No. You live next to me, don't you? Yeah. You can say hello when you see me. You don't have to be afraid. There's a lot of things going around about me, but none of it's true. Okay? You been a good boy this year? I think so. Swear to it? No. Yeah, I had a feeling. Well, this is the place to be if you're feeling bad about yourself. It is? I think so. Are you feeling bad about yourself? No. I've been kind of a pain lately. I said some things I shouldn't have. I really haven't been too good this year. Yeah. I'm kind of upset about it because I really like my family. Even though sometimes I say I don't. Sometimes I even think I don't. Do you get that? I think so. How you feel about your family is a complicated thing. Especially with an older brother. Deep down you always love 'em, but you can forget that you love 'em. And you can hurt them and they can hurt you. And that's not just because you're young. You want to know the real reason why I'm here right now? Sure. I came to hear my granddaughter sing, and I can't come and hear her tonight. You have plans? No. I'm not welcome. At church? You're always welcome at church. I'm not welcome with my son. Years back, before you and your family moved on the block, I had an argument with my son. How old is he? He's grown up. We lost our tempers... and I said I didn't care to see him anymore. He said the same and we haven't spoken to each other since. If you miss him, why don't you call him? I'm afraid if I call him, he won't talk to me. How do you know? I don't know. I'm just afraid he won't. No offense, but aren't you a little old to be afraid? You can be a little old for a lot of things. You're never too old to be afraid. That's true. I've always been afraid of our basement. It's dark. There's weird stuff down there and it smells funny. That sort of thing. It's bothered me for years. Basements are like that. Then I made myself go down there to do some laundry and I found out it's not so bad. All this time I've been worrying about it but if you turn on the lights, it's no big deal. What's your point? My point is you should call your son. What if he won't talk to me? At least you'll know. Then you could stop worrying about it and you won't have to be afraid anymore. I don't care how mad I was, I'd talk to my dad especially around the holidays. I don't know. Just give it a shot. For your granddaughter anyway. I'm sure she misses you and the presents. I send her a check. I wish my grandparents sent that. They always send me clothes. Last year I got a sweater with a big bird knitted on it. That's nice. Not for a guy in the second grade. You can get beat up for wearing something like that. Yeah. I have a friend who got nailed 'cause there was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas. You'd better run along home where you belong. You think about what I said. All right? Okay. It was nice talking to you. Nice talking to you. ♪♪ [CHOIR SINGING] What about you? Me? Yeah. You and your son. We'll see what happens. Merry Christmas.
