Hey, man, General Government. We are almost at home. There are no "katyushas", no cannons. Do you understand - Italian? We go home for holidays. All partisans, all communists... Everybody get out! Quickly! Move it! Quickly, get out on the right side. GIUSEPPE IN WARSAW Hey, you! Don't run away! What are you afraid of? Come here! Get off the track, you idiot! Get your ass out of the track... or I'll kick it when I get down. Miss, would you like to sit down? No, thank you. This one, can sleep like a log. If you, brother, walked form Stalingrad to Poland, you would sleep as well. He is so handsome for a German. Don't worry, you can see him. You can have your hair cut for seeing a German but not for a handsome guy from Sorrento. Oh, he is Italian. How do you know? I know everything, missy. Hey! Hey, stop it! He looks like he's sleeping but I can feel he wants my sausages. He's calling me mom because he wants me to feel pity for him. Hey, are you Italian? Si, si. He wants to take a leak. Are you crazy? "Si, si" in Italian means "yes". Italian, Hitler is dead, right? Dead. Dead, dead. Hey, Mussolini is dead, isn't he? He is our boy, let's give him some vodka. A full glass. Come on, take it, drink it. Look at him. Take it. The Italians are like children, they drink only wine. Leave him. Three thousand. Three thousand, do you understand? Four thousand. Hey man, don't make us listen to this, for God's sake. He's whining! Quiet, quiet... So much money. Who will pay you more? It's a good deal for that piece of crap. Quiet. Ok, five thousand. Give me that guitar and fall asleep. Do as you want but nobody will give you any more. Come on, come on. No, no, in Italian. Yes, in Italian. What? God damn, your piece. Oh, leave me alone. Stop shouting, idiot, the Germans are rounding us up and they are going to arrest us. How can I know. You should have taken care of it. They must have stolen it. STOLEN Stolen. You should have taken the five thousand I was giving you and now leave me alone. Be quiet! Take it, take it! Be quiet, yes, yes, I'll explain it later. Let's go. Quickly, quickly! He is Italian, I'm with this Italian! Let's go. Your gun is there, go. Move it, quickly! Don't worry, there are no partisans here. That's a pretty girl! He is lucky, she wouldn't like to talk to us. Damn Italian. Stop here. That's enough. The ride is finished. Come here. You go to the barracks. You go straight and take the second turning on your right. Do you understand? Goodbye and give me that gun. Give me the gun! Do you understand? The gun I gave you... the gun I gave you at the station. Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about. Give me the gun! Be quiet, you idiot, the Germans. Let me go, you gangster. Isn't this too much display of love? You're paying miss and off you go or you get on and we go. You won't go any further. Hey! Come back. Give me the gun and come back. No, no, no, I'm living here, you're going nowhere! The gun! Gangster! Al Capone! Mafia! Good morning, Mr. Kowalski. Don't push me! You pig, baboon. None of your business, do you understand? Welcome, Miss. Stand up! Hands up! Move! Your ID. An ID. Here you are. False. False, of course. Partisans, bandits. What's this, my child? This.. is a pistol. A pistol. No, this is my pistol! No, my pistol! Quiet! MY! Come! Damn it! Stop kidding, Janek, for goodness sake. Who is he? Who have you brought here, you idiot? He's Italian. I met him on a train. He didn't want to give me back the pistol. My God, an Italian from a train. I'll go crazy. Look, she's brought an Italian to a den. Just before the commission. Quiet! Quiet! We have to give him back the pistol and send him away immediately. You've gone crazy. What? This is my pistol. My pistol... my pistol. Do you want him to bring the whole Gestapo here? But... Don't you know the Italians? Scream now. Quiet! Quiet! You Polish bandit! Quiet! You are free. Go! Get out! Pretend you're searching the flat now. In two minutes you'll join us downstairs. Maryska! For goodness sake! Are you out of your mind? I'll go crazy living with her. Leave that staff. Who will clean it? And you - be quiet! Ok, ok, stop shouting. If I had listened to you it wouldn't have done me any good. Felek, you are the witness. We'll all have troubles because of her. Chicken! Yellow belly! Maryska! Don't do any jokes! I tell you, since the war started I tell you... No, that is not the truth. And be quiet as you talk to me! No, I won't be quiet! You are a coward! Partisans! Hands up! Hands up! Polish bandits! Get out of here! Damn you! Damn you! He's killed me. No, I won't play along. No. You see, it's all your fault. And you! Be careful when you hit! You idiot! Barracks, do you understand? Straight, left and then the third turning on your right, do you understand? Barracks, left and then the third turning on your right. Understood? She is arrested, she is a partisan! Goodbye. Go! Go! He hasn't even stepped aside for one centimeter. Damn Italian. Who are you? I'm called volksdeutsch. What's your emblem? A broken cross. Who has created you? The winds. What will happen to you? The chains. You puppy, you jerk, I'll teach you. Police! I'm sorry. Barracks? Go straight. Hey. hey! You Italian? To barracks? Forbidden. Get out of here or I'll kick your ass. Go, you idiot. Stop! Your ID! ID! Giuseppe Santuchi. Where is your pistol? Thank you, goodbye. Stop! Come here! Come here! You damn Italian. Where have you hidden your weapon? It's ready. Let's go away! Don't pretend you're an idiot. Where is your weapon? I've said hundreds of times that these times are not for me. You are the bane of our family. Even our grandma has suffered for the freedom. Two years in captivity with no complaints. Yes, but at least she visited some foreign countries. And I don't want to, don't know how, and I can't. Staszek, look! Staszek! This is... This is my pistol. You are right, we have to stay calm. You have to disarm this bastard at once. Disarm? What else do you want, miss? Then, you'll kick him out of here of course. Yes, I'll kick him out of here. Now... Staszek, a soldier is walking around your flat. In my home... Staszek, my dear, be a man once in your life. Yes, right. Staszek, Remember it for good that everything has its place and it means something in here. Do you understand? Staszek, don't leave alone with him. Do you hear me? Do Alinka want any paste for cockroaches? I want no paste. I want no cockroaches. I want no Alinka! And Military Academy exercises are on the next floor! I'm sorry. Remember it well finally! Are you crazy? Staszek! How much do you want for that piece of crap? I don't know. For your grandma. For my grandma. Thank you. Can we talk? Be careful at the market. Near the prison a man wearing glasses is selling a weapon. Fiat? Well, it's an unusual weapon. It doesn't sell well, problems with ammunition. Listen, we won't get rid of him in any other way. It's a scandal. I'll give you the number - Fiat 22 015. 22 015. Number isn't a problem. I'll remember it. The German is grateful and let the cat out of the bag. There is a man wearing glasses on the square who want to hawk his machinegun. He knows him. He is a guard from Wehrmacht prison. He is a spook, I'm sure. In glasses? Tell the guys to keep an eye on the bastard. The next one? Sure. Ties, ties... My goddess, only she can understand me. My God, my dear, it's the death of me. Since the beginning of the war I have painted nothing but eyes and horns of deer. But deer, Cleopatra and Magdalene sell the best. You've learned it a bit but you won't make an artist. Listen, mate, I swear, try to understand me, I'm the breadwinner and I have a juvenile sister, who is... she doesn't have much in her head and now this idiotic Italian mouth to feed. Turn off the light! Turn off the light! You blithering idiot! It's the war! It's the blackout! Do you think you can play jokes on the Germans? And above all it's so awful, so selfish, when they hit the tenement house all the people will die not only you. You think that they won't kill you because you're Italian. They won't recognize you standing in the window in this shirt. Err.. even if you had had the uniform... if you had had the uniform... why do you sleepwalk instead of sleeping at night? Maryska! Coming! Maryska! Have you called me, brother? What's this? What? Your only clothes, sweetheart. Right. And this pattern? This picturesque motif? Oh, Jesus! You've painted it. Maryska, that's enough. Stop kidding. I'm not kidding. Don't look so surprised, this is the lube for your tanks, grenades and bombs. Staszku! Yes! Maryska, as long as it doesn't concern me you're welcome to do whatever you want. But if you destroy my last heirloom clothes I'll... Quiet... Hey! Macaroni head! That's the end. You bandit. Sicilian! You pig! What have you done to my trousers? Look! Right, right, a miracle, miracle. Maryska! Here you are! It would be my fault again. Hey, Italian, dinner is served. I mean eating. Eat, dinner. Eat. Yes. Come here. Sit down. He'll have a nice opinion about the Polish hospitality. I won't eat with the enemy at one table. That's all because there is no man at home. I told you to kick him out of here. I haven't brought him here. Well, let's change the subject. He told you "bella kwoka" it's a nice compliment. "Quoca" not "kwoka" if you had learnt some Italian you'd know it means "good hostess". A lady of the house. For me a dumb housewife. Good morning, "have the toads spawned"? For goodness sake! Not at the dinnertime! Staszek! "The stork has eaten the tadpoles". We've brought... Be quiet! Staszek! Yes. Sit down, I'll help you in a moment. Come, come. But how are we going to carry this? Didn't they tell you? They've told us it's going to be long but not that long. What?! I have got so many problems with him. Take this. Hurry up, we'll leave together. Oh my God, it's four o'clock. My trousers! I'll kill you! Do you understand? You Sicilian bandit! You macaroni head. Staszek, Zosiu, a balloon. Why do you look like that? Me? I look like a human being. Zosiu, I'll go to Italy, gondolas, Venice, Capri. That's the life for an artist. But you can't speak Italian. Me? You underestimate me. Zosiu, let's talk. It's not expensive. No, thank you. Get out of here! You spook. What? Get out! So what's next, Satyr? That's ok, you're free, you can go. Run away! The Germans are catching people! A German won't spit in our face! Go dragoons! Go there! Zoska! Stop! Come here. What's this? What? You damn Italian! I'm sorry. Why don't you salute? Not like that! Like this... Happy birthday... Satyr! What Satyr? I don't know him. Oh my God! What have you been doing here? Excuse me, miss, what do you want? And first of all... Now we can talk. To the bathroom and stay there. Sorry, I've forgot about the damned underground. Right. Staszek! Where is this idiot? Which idiot? This Sicilian bandit. In the bathroom. You damn Italian! You Mediterranean idiot! Why didn't you tell me to salute to the Germans! Malgosia, listen, tell the surgeon that we need an immediate operation. Yes, it's a serious condition. A mosquito adores caviar. Yes. I'll tell you in a minute. In a minute, I can't tell you now. Is there anything left? Nothing. It's clear for you that the repository, the den and you are finished. I'd advise you to hide somewhere in the provinces. But I can... No, you can't. the whole network is changed, the contacts are finished. Is that clear? That's an order from the headquarters. Yes, sir. Thank you on behalf of the army. Satyr, damn you, stand up. Go. No, no. Up. Professor, you should be ashamed. I'm not a professor, only Satyr. It's delicious! I've never eaten anything like that. Goodness me, it's delectable. Maria, Maria, you are ill. Why you don't eat? A lot of time you don't eat. Here you are, Maria. Eat, please. Maria, please. Get out of here. She's going to do it immediately. I'm finished in the underground because of you. Get out of my home and don't come back. No, neither your nor my memory will follow this order... I'm sorry. Maryska! Flowers, fiancé. Hans, your hat! Smolensk! All communists are dead! All! The German - Italian friendship. This is my friend, he is a good boy. Italian. You pig! All the Italians are cowards. Yes, but he is not. He's my friend. I have to shoot him. I have only two friends - you and him. You are my friends. Now I have none. This weapon is for the communists. No, that's ok. I like it that way. You finally behave like a ordinary woman. No bombs, no grenades only quiet, honest work. Staszek, Yes. I swear, you know more about socks, then about all that... And my God, my child, it's peace and quiet like on holidays in Swider. And does the Military Academy practice? Well... Maryska, no underground. You are finished, you know that the best. I'm vindicated. What vindication? What are you talking about? Quarantine is finished. No quarantine! I won't let you go! Nobody will come in! I'm here! I'm here! I won't let... no! A daisy has bloomed in the attic. Nobody!... when it's finished, call me! A gift. An arsenal? Have you found it in Warsaw? Where? That's the end. Now she's in love. My God, why don't I have a brother? Giuseppe... Stasiek... excuse me, could you go to the bathroom for a second? I want to talk to Giuseppe. So where did you go when you left the station? Staszek, are you still here? My God, she's head over heels. Here you are. Have you found it? Staszek, could you go to the bathroom? Giuseppe, come here. This is Warsaw. This is the station. When you left the station... Station, trains, quiet, station. When you left... we'll draw it. Do you have the pencil I gave you? I gave you a pencil. A pencil. A kiss. A kiss? You kiss. Lot of kiss. Stop kidding, Giuseppe. Did you go Marszalkowska Street or Aleje Jerozolimskie? My love... do you love me? You know what, Do you love me? We shall go and you'll show me the place. Do you love me? Yes a bit. Let's go. Staszek, to the bathroom. Staszek, go to the bathroom. Staszek, Staszek, go to the bathroom. I know! Have you heard anything? Some shooting. It seems to be a cap gun. I've told them to be careful. Be careful, there are four Germans on the corner. They've stopped. They light a cigarette. They talk to a shopkeeper. More single thumps! What's going on here? We pretend we are having a party, can't you see? Yes, yes, very well, more. I have to talk to you. Oh no, it's impossible now. You must be crazy. Now or never. Maryska! All right. Sit down, please. Sit down comfortably, Marysia. Make yourself at home. I have a lecture form the infantry tactics. Marysia, Staszek, stop moaning, be quick. What's the matter? It can't go on like that. Please understand. We are learning from the chapter "the infantry in attack". Giuseppe can't speak Polish. We can't understand him. I can't be distracted. But I sit here 24 hours a day! But you've always dreamt about your own room. Maryska, I swear, one day I'll kill you, the handsome Italian and all the students! Be quiet! Sit down! Don't even think about it! You're not even sworn in! Me? Be quiet? In my own home? No! It won't be like that! Beside all, I have to leave even if the world would come to an end! And I have to tell you something. I'm the breadwinner. Me! I feed you, the Italian and the army. That's enough! Stop talking about the army. Mar... You can go. Even now. But he is wearing my clothes, Maryska! Yes, he is! Should he be wearing an enemy army uniform? An instructor of the Underground Military Academy? I'm not crazy yet. No problem, but there are no eggs, carbide, bread, flour and money. Stasiek, I swear. We go through "the street fights" chapter and then do whatever you want. Please understand, it's about discipline, the program... What program? The program must be fulfilled. Calm down, Maryska. Come on, Stasiek. They're calling me. Sweetheart... I'm here! Be quick... Maryska! Badoglio government has surrendered! As we have announced, the government of Marshal Badoglio betrayed us and signed the capitulation of the Italian Army to the British and American Army who entered the Italian territory. The Italian surrender is a disgusting betrayal of Europe done by Emanuel III a lying puppet king and his... People! Help! The German Army is totally in control of military situation in Italy. The Italian army doesn't exist. This is the worst betrayal ever written about in the history. Fuhrer said: the betrayers of the Italian nation will be given a lesson... Long live Italy! Viva Italy! What do you want? The end of the war! I don't understand. He's lost the war... No, no, no I need to do my business. People! People! I... Polish from Skierniewice... People! people! Watch out! The Germans! Are you nuts? So, Giuseppe Santuchi, you don't understand German? No, Captain! How much did you get for your weapon? No, Captain! Listen Giuseppe Santuchi, do you want to come back to your military unit and be shot there? or do you want us to deal with you here? No.. holidays... Yes, Sir. Tell him that he is a deserter and he'll be shot at the Military Court. But he has to tell us first, we have special methods here, that even the Italian couldn't imagine. No, this is not Italian! This is bull shit! We speak German. This is not Italian. Quiet you pig! I keep you here so you don't have to fight at the front line and you can't speak Italian? Stop, stop! Come back! And you tell me that you can speak Italian better that the Italian! But Captain! Be quiet! I send you to the front line with the next train. Captain, they have stolen my weapon on the train. Soldiers! Why hasn't anybody stolen my gun? Shut up. Do you know what they do with the soldiers who have been disarmed? You dump pig! Captain, holiday, no weapon, Rome... You damn Italian, you civilian, stand up! A gun is for a soldier like a wife! He sleeps with it, eat with it. A word of honor... I'll shoot myself but first I'll shoot you, bandit! I'll shoot you later. Take him away. I'll talk to him later, you Italian bandit. But we'll speak German. Go! My God! Maria! What's the matter? What's wrong? Does it hurt so much? Sit down. Sit down. Wait. Lie down. It must be appendicitis. Aunt Wisia died because of that. I'll bring you some tea and a medicine. Who did you sell your gun to? I didn't sell it. Yes, right. Come! I go myself! Dinner! Go! Sour milk! Delicious! I know one house... we can go there... it will take us two hours... a girl. I am married. I have four children. Four children and one wife, this is a problem. She wants me to send her money. Others send gold, rings. And me? Where should I take the money from? From my wage? Dinner! Stand up! Dinner! I'll go to the market and ask Zosia if she saw Staszek, and we'll meet at Zbozowa Street at 2 o'clock. Repeat: "Zbozowa at 2 o'clock" "Zbozowa street at 2 o'clock". That's fine. We can't go out together... There's the war. Do you have the food coupons? Good morning, Sir Kowalski. Good morning, Sir. Yes, these are the ones we need. Kowalski's gone crazy about hiding. Last week he dressed up as a child. He was wearing shorts and had a lollypop. Santuchi! Get up! Captain Kiszke is waiting for you. Maryska! He wants to talk to you. But he's very angry! Quickly! Go! You are here, you damn Italian! You pig! I have one hour. Let's do something. What? Weapon business. An hour is too much, we have to do it now. What's this? A machine gun and "parabellum". That is a piece of shit. What are you doing? Come back! This is not in my interests. I don't have any money. Let me go, damn you. I'm sorry. What's the matter? Let's go. I have to get some weapon. Business is business. Speak German. I don't understand you. I need to shoot. Do you understand? Listen, A street, only one soldier. You... The Germans? Why not? Holiday, house, money, children, luxury. But why me? It should be you. Me? You. I don't know the Germans. They are pigs for you. You should do it. Me? Goodbye. With my hands? I don't have a gun. Take that. The money is for you. Yes, for me. Stop! Hands up! Man! What's that? I have a wife two children and an old father. Stand up, turn round and go home. Not good, once again. We try again. You are stupid. My gun! Stop! hands up! What are you doing? I have a wife. The barracks? Straight? No, here. Stop, hands up! Go! Help! In the German uniform? Did he speak German? Where? Here. Stop! Hands up! Run away, you damn bandit! Be careful, come. "Mauser", a piece of shit. Not good price. Look here. Yes, this is good. Stop, hands up! What's the matter? Stop! I was walking here and there were tree Germans in uniforms. Those are they. We met a group of people in German uniforms. They were disarming the German soldiers. What? There was some shooting. Fight them! Shoot at them! Have you really seen Staszek? Staszek is a hero. A hero? You must be joking. Good morning, You are given a decoration for meritorious service and gaining several guns, grenades and other kinds of weapon from the enemy. Didn't you recognize Janek? He arrested me when you came to us for the first time. See? He didn't recognize you. Good morning. Giuseppe Santuchi? Yes. Who are you? It's Wiktor's order. The Underground War Tribunal. Three days ago in a tram... Which number? It's the secret of the court. A patrol of the Underground Army soldiers, who were going on a military operation was disarmed by deceit. By deceit, sure! They were robbed. Our investigation proved that he was the one who stole the guns. He was dressed up as an Italian soldier. Do you confess? Do you confess? They were dressed up in German uniforms. Yes, we have to introduce some marks for the Underground soldiers. White and red armbands or little eagles, here will be the best. This is not a discussion for us to have. The Army Tribunal sentences you to death. Stop kidding. Yes, but not from us. Shoot! Shoot! All bandits! You'll tell all that to the Commander. Who are you shooting at? You idiot! They are Polish! To civilians, to Polish people? Giuseppe, Giuseppe, don't be afraid! This is us! You idiot, who are you shooting at? At your own people? Shoot! Shoot now! Help! Sta... Staszek! Staszku, for goodness sake, what has happened to you? Where have you been? I was walking in the forest and picking up mushrooms. There is shooting in the city. There are many Germans killed. I'm sure they're arresting people. Haven't you seen? No, they aren't. I haven't seen anything. Italian, give me back my clothes, right now. Have you heard that? I'm sick of that uniform. Staszku, all that on your own...? What? Yes, me. there's some more left on the stairs. Are you nuts? I have always said that we would all be lost because of him. Have you walked with all that through the city? No, no I've flown. Jesus! A million of spooks have seen you! We're lost. Maryska, it's all your fault, yours and his! I wanted to keep out of this and I didn't manage to. Daisy? Listen, there is some food for the canaries. With the old stock it may need a truck. Immediately. Immediately! I'm waiting. Yes. Yes. Giuseppe! We have to pack this quickly. The boys will be here in a moment and Gestapo as well. Attention! Who are you, bandit? I'm from an infantry regiment. What? East front line! You! Walter Botke from 3 company. Shoot him! And you? Waldemar Miller. Execution. Otto, execution too? No, East front line. Thank you. Captain Kiszke, welcome. East front line, general? No, execution. "Are the canaries hungry"? Catch! Giuseppe, my dresses! Quickly! Quickly! Be careful! Not, this one. That one. Staszek for goodness sake! Staszek! What? We're running away! It's going to be hell here, in a moment! I'm staying. Have you lost your mind? We have to go! Stasiek! I need piece and quiet. Suit yourself. Goodbye. Stasiek! Maryska! Giuseppe! Giuseppe! Catch her! Get out! Round up the house! Quickly! There's nobody at home. Who, the hell, is this? Open! The police! Jarek, stop kidding. These are not the times for an artist. Stop! Stop! He can't control it. Brake! I don't have brakes. Password, password! "The canaries have eaten a stork", or something like that. Not good, not good. Tomato sauce very good. Take that. No, no I can't, thank you. No, no that's not for me, I'm a dreamer. There are some more paintings I'd like to paint. I'll walk in the forest, paint, work romantically. The canaries have eaten a stork. Men! Help! The Germans! Men! Alarm! Alarm! I don't know how to shoot! If I had found it earlier there wouldn't be all that mess.
