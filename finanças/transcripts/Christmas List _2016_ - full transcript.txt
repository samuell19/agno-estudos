RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Isobel? The ornaments are only for looking, remember? Those are very expensive. When I grow up can I have a real tree? Why would you want that? This one will be yours one day. Besides, real trees dry out, sweetie. This way everything stays neat and clean. There we go. That's better. Can I make a gingerbread house? You know I just cleaned the kitchen. But we can get one from the bakery if you'd like. Just play quietly and don't get your colours on the carpet. Someday I'm gonna have my own Christmas, with gingerbread and decorations I can touch. And a lot of other stuff. Help me think, Buddy. Ice skating, sing caroling, a picture with Santa, and a real tree. Perfect as ever, Isobel. It just wouldn't be Christmas without that tree. Aren't family traditions just wonderful? Thank you for agreeing to house sit, mom. With all those painters running around my place, I needed somewhere to escape. And I'll find plenty to do around here. That could use a little water, dear. Hey, is that what I think it is? I found it in your old bedroom closet. Thought you might like to have it. It's my old treasure box! My doll. My old building blocks? I haven't thought about these things in years. You know, these big ones really should be on the bottom branches, right? Have you decided where you and your new boyfriend are going, by the way? No, not yet. Brett left it up to me but I know he'd prefer Hawaii. And how are you two doing? Is this serious? It's fun. Too soon to tell. I think we're both thinking this will be a good opportunity for us to get to know one another better. It's my old Christmas list! Ice skate, sing carols, picture with Santa... where did I think of all these things? All those old holiday movies you used to love so much I guess. Everything I thought Christmas should be. What? What're you doing? Maybe we won't go to Hawaii this year after all. Perfect Christmas town? Perfect Christmas town. That's everything I always thought Christmas should look like. Snow. I always wanted snow. Pine trees! Icicles! Snow! Yeah, that's what I get for spending my entire life in San Diego, right? 85 degrees in December, how is that normal? Let's hear it for Isobel Grey, everyone. Our award-winning VP of design and the one to thank for today's celebration. To Isobel. Isobel. Well, I hope you all are having a great time and you know how much I love to organize. Mr. Bishop? A Mr. Hernandez? Put that through to my office. I... I'm sorry everyone, I have to take this but here's to you all with thanks for a great year gone by and an even better year ahead. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Oh! Goodness! I am so, so sorry! Don't even worry about it. It's a fashion house so luckily we have options. Hey, everyone! There is cake. I didn't make it so... You all are safe. Come in. Sorry I had to duck out. Is everything alright? It is now. I'm all done with work and now I get to spend seven whole days alone with this new guy I've been seeing. New guy? I don't like the sound of that. Anyone I know? Brett Bishop? Maybe you've heard of him? He owns the company? Brett Bishop... Brett Bishop Design? That Brett Bishop? Yeah. Lucky guy. So, I know we talked about going somewhere hot, somewhere beachy... Right. But I made us reservations in the most perfect Christmas town ever. Why do I have a feeling we have different ideas about what that is. Snow, roaring fireplaces, sweaters. And to make sure we don't forget about a thing, I made a bucket list. A bucket list. Are you alright? 'Cause, you know, usually you make a bucket list if you're about to... Not that kind of bucket list, a Christmas bucket list. A list of things you wanna make sure you do before the holidays are gone. Not me. See? I started it when I was a kid. I just updated it. They're all the things I missed out on growing up. A real tree, caroling, ice skating. These all sound very cold. What about palm trees or Santa on a surf board? We have so much to learn about each other. Please tell me you love it. I just so want a real Christmas this year. What's... what's this last one? A secret wish? Well that one's new but I promise you it's worth your time to find out. Really? What do you think? This is... this is great. It's amazing, but... I've got some bad news. I mean, not... not bad news... OK, yeah, no it's... it's bad. Our factory down in Rio, they got a real mess on their hands and I have to fly down there. South America? When? Oh no. If there was a way around it... But... but our flights are first thing in the morning. You go without me. I'll meet you there in a few days. Christmas at the latest. But that's days away. I will make this up to you. I promise. OK? I gotta run. I'll call you. Nothing a little Christmas can't fix. Decorate a real tree. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Too tilty... Yes. You're perfect. Look at you. You even smell like Christmas. How would you like to come home with me? Hi there. This one's taken for. Looks like we have a problem. No, not really because I saw it first. OK. Maybe you saw that side of it first, but... This side, that side, it's all the same tree so if you wouldn't mind just letting go. Alright, well here's the thing. Kyle here has really got his heart set on this one, so... Kyle? Kyle, and... that's Trish. Hi. I'm sorry, you are...? Isobel. Isobel Grey. Hi Isobel Grey, Jamie Haughton. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Wanna come to my show? It's a school thing. Not now, Kyle, we're negotiating. Well, no. We're not exactly negotiating because there's nothing to negotiate because this tree is mine. OK. Here's the thing. I'd be happy to help you find another tree in the lot... Oh, no, Jamie... you don't mind if I call you Jamie, do you? You see, this may be a little bit hard to believe but I picked out this exact tree 25 years ago. That's very hard to believe. I'm not kidding. This exact tree. This... this shape and size and colour. I've been dreaming about this tree since I first knew what a Christmas tree was. See, I'm from California... Oh, Jamie, give her the tree. Listen to your wife. Actually, I'm... This Christmas has got to be the one that I have in my head. She's got Christmas in her head? That's what she says. The perfect town, the perfect cottage, the perfect holiday getaway for me and my... my boyfriend. Is he in your head, too? No, he's coming, later, eventually, we think, by Christmas. Most likely. He's a very busy man. Is your boyfriend Santa Clause? Could we get back to the tree please? Yes. Here's the thing: when Kyle sets his mind on something there's just no changing... I found another one! He found another one. I'll go. Let her have the tree. The place closes in five minutes. Thank you. OK. Thank you, Kyle, wherever you are. Just come to my show! So he plays clarinet at the Christmas pageant at his school. It's the day after tomorrow. That's what that is. And it's looking like that's gonna be the price for the tree, so... are you in? Absolutely. Sure. I'll do my very best. Great. Thank you. Sure. Merry Christmas. Really. Merry Christmas to you. Really. It seems so much easier in my head. Hey! Hey. You want a hand? I got lots of room in the back. If I need a ride I'll call a taxi. Bye. Right. Are you sure it's not... too big? It's a pretty big tree. I know what I'm doing. Oh, goodness. Yeah, I can see you've got everything under control there. OK, fine. Help. Only if you're sure. I don't want to impose. I could do it myself. Really. Thank you. No problem. That's very nice. Beautiful tree. Excellent choice. Alright. Hey, I know you said you had a boyfriend, right? Is that... is that serious? Well, we're... we're figuring it out. We're assessing things. What does that mean? Ah? Nothing. Just a regular old "ah". I have to admit you were right. It fits perfectly. I told you, I've been planning this forever. And the very best part is it's completely real. Is this the first time you've ever had a real tree? My mom always thought they were too messy. I grew up terrified that Santa was gonna pass our house by because there wasn't a real tree in the window. Well, hey, maybe this year Santa's gonna bring you what you really want. Maybe he will. What's going on over here? The tree needs ornaments. And you're making them? Some of them. I'm sure it's not the kind of construction you're used to. I saw your truck. Haughton Construction. You're not the only one around here who's observant. I'm impressed. Well, what I am gonna do is grab you some more fuel for that fire. Nights can dip into the single digits out here. I don't want you freezing before Santa can even show up. I'm just fine, I can take care of myself. Just answer your call. I'm gonna get some wood and then I'll leave, OK? Oh, hey! Izzy, hey. Look, I just got a quick second between meetings. How's it going? It's so great. Look, look. I got us a tree. That one? It looks a little, you know, bare. Well, I'm getting to that. One thing at a time. You know what? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it when I get up there. So when do you think that might be? Well, I'm still gonna be here for a few more days. I really, really miss you. I hate thinking of you all alone up there. Hey. I'll put it by the fireplace, OK? Oh, yeah, perfect. Who was that? Is... is somebody there with you? No, just log man. Log man? OK, you're all set. Sorry. Enjoy your stay. I will. Thank you, log man. Thank you very much. Say hello to your wife and son. My sister and nephew. Yeah, will do. Izzy? I think we have a bad connection. Isobel? Hi. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. Yes, I miss you, too. Alright. Gingerbread recipe. Better bring the hoses, boys. This could be a real barn burner. No! There's no barn, no burning. Stay back, ma'am. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Jamie? You're a fireman too? Volunteer brigade. I help out when I can. Stay here, we got this. There's nothing to get! Will somebody just listen to me? Just for the record I'm normally a much neater cook than this. OK. So all this just from cooking, huh? Well, baking, cooking... Well, you don't need the fire department, ma'am. What you need is a... clean-up crew. Say, Scotty, she's actually a friend of mine. My shift's almost over, do you mind if I stay here and just help her clean this stuff up? It's fine with me, just keep her away from the oven. And future reference, you might wanna consider take-out. Thanks. Thank you, Scotty. You know, it was such a beautiful day. Such a great morning. I woke up early, the sun was shining, there were birds chirping and it was just perfect. And then, there it was, this sign: "Gingerbread Contest." It's an annual thing. Of course it's an annual thing, because this is exactly what I've dreamed about. A small town, these traditional activities, and I thought hey, why not? I can do that. Build a gingerbread house? Yes. Exactly. And I was ready. I bought everything, I... I got gumdrops and... and peppermint sticks. Fence post? No. No thanks, I'm... no. I'm fine. Listen, I'll tell you what. If it's really that important to you... It really is. OK, that contest? Yeah? Everything's pre-baked. Really? Yeah. All you have to do is put it together. You don't say. So if you want to drive me back into town I can guarantee you a spot at the table. Hold that thought. Mom, yes. You didn't call last night so I thought... what's happened to you? What... Oh, that? I'm fine. It was just a little baking accident. Is that a fireman behind you? Yep. Hello. Yeah, there's nothing... nothing going on here, mom. Everything is all good. The fireman is gonna take me to a... To a hospital, right? No, to a gingerbread contest. Honey, we have a bad connection. Listen mom, I need to go so you just relax and I will talk to you soon. OK? Bye bye. Now. About that contest. These kids are ringers, making me look bad. I think you know one of these ringers, actually. Kyle, remember Isobel? Don't forget my show tomorrow. I won't. You know, there's no limit to the amount of candy you can use. It's unlimited. Thank you, that's very helpful, but I'm going for a more streamlined look. Well, mission accomplished there. You should probably add a bit more icing to your roof though, it's gonna fall off. Who's house is this? Which one of us owns a construction company? Oh no! How much time do I have? Not much. Tick tock. OK, contestants. That's it. Everybody step back from your gingerbread houses. Do you think I have a chance? If they judge by the pound, you're golden. Hey, seventh place. That's not so bad, right? No. Considering there were only seven contestants... Hey. You're not helping. Hey, I know something that'll cheer you up. It's a place my mom used to take me when I was a kid. I don't think I wanna know. Do you trust me? At this point, what else do I have to lose? That's the spirit. This is incredible. Right? Where did these come from? Well, Santa's elves actually built this as a gift for the town over 100 years ago. I almost believe that. Yeah, I thought you might. Tell me, what's the fascination with the gingerbread houses? When I was little there was a bakery in my neighbourhood. Every year around the holidays she had this amazing gingerbread house in the window and I'd just walk by it and imagine the perfect cookie woman in her perfect cookie house. I'm gonna take a wild guess and say this cookie woman's name was Isobel. What gave it away? Yeah. And she was a designer just like me. Oh, really? What do you design? Fashion. Yeah. Brett Bishop Designs. Very cool. So what you're wearing right now, did you design that? Yeah, I did. I love it. Thank you so much. Me too. The company design is a little more polished, more urban. It's not exactly where my heart is but boy does it sell. Right. Pretty cool, huh? This is perfect. So gingerbread Isobel... Yeah. ...she's what? Realistic. Okay. So she doesn't design what she likes? She designs what sells. She has her own brand, her own company. Something big, international. And that house, probably in Paris. Paris? The property value there is... the gumdrop sidewalk alone... She can afford it. She's wildly successful, remember? Very good. Enough about me, tell me about you. If you were a gingerbread man who would you be? Oh, my guy? Easy. Just wants to be happy, own his own business, little family, lots of small town gingerbread friends. Alright. To each his own, I guess. Hey, listen. After all that construction today and this horseback race, you gotta be building up an appetite. Let me buy you lunch. You mean like a... like a date? No, no. It'll be more like a consolation prize, you know? Plus there's that old saying: Man cannot live on gingerbread alone. Giddy up! Here's your usual. And one for the lady, on the house seeing as it's almost Christmas. What? Thank you, Patty. Thank you. Are you supposed to eat these or climb them? Cute girl. Beautiful jacket. Thank you. She's talented, too. She designed that jacket herself, right? Well, something like that would sell like hotcakes up here. Really? Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Even the hotcakes don't sell like hotcakes up here, Patty. Joke hurts. But I'm serious about this girl. Don't mess it up. We're not together. Well, that's a shame. Water. I'll be right back. Thank you. OK. OK. Let's be honest. Who has a mouth this big? Sorry, you were saying? Never mind. I have to say, I still can't believe the mess I made yesterday. Being messy is fun sometimes. Sometimes I guess, but it's like a road trip. It's better if you have a map, right? Then you miss all the surprises along the way. Great job colour coordinating the sugar packets, by the way. Couldn't even look at them before. You know what your tree needs? What? Lights. I didn't even think of that. Perfect. Are we ready? I am ready. OK. Here we go. Alright. Alright. I think that is the most beautiful Christmas tree I have ever had. It's the one in your head. Exactly. Alright. It's making me think of something I haven't done since I was a kid, but we used to do it all the time. A tree this size... do you want to try it? It's a little odd. Considering the source, I'm not surprised. Come on. Here. Come down here. What are you doing? Just... it's not too weird, I promise. Just lie down. Come on. And this accomplishes what, exactly? Just look up. That's what a Christmas sky should look like. That's spectacular. Spectacular. Thank you, Jamie. I'm very happy right now. Very tired. But very happy. Isobel? Mom?! Well, it's worse than I thought. You asleep under the tree... I can explain that. And now this? It's a wonder anyone got out alive. Mom, seriously. Why are you here? You said you needed me. I didn't. I listened between the lines. What lines? There were no lines. Look. Show me to my room, we'll get started. What room? You don't have a room. You don't... you're not even supposed to be here. This was on the front door. "I didn't want to wake you" it says. Who's Jamie? Nobody. Just a somebody who helped me with the tree lights. Why did he leave you under the tree like a Christmas package? And where is the boyfriend? The boyfriend is coming. Mom, seriously, you can't stay. I'm not kidding. You know, I didn't bring the right clothes. It's much colder here than I thought. And have you noticed it's so small? The streets, the buildings, everything is so small. And... is that a real tree? Isobel. And the lights are all wrong. They're all bunched up. They look right to me. Never mind, we'll fix them later. So where's my room? You don't have a room. Because you don't live here. So where's Brett? Brett who? I'm just kidding. Brett's still coming, mom. He just had a last minute business trip. No, seriously. The company is growing very fast, concessions have to be made. Yes, but it seems like the only person making concessions is you. That's exactly why I need this time with him... alone. Time you're not getting. I'm not kidding. I have to figure out whether this is just, you know, casual dating or something more serious. Darling. Let's go for a sandwich is casual. Let's spend a week in a cabin? I'm not so sure. I'm almost afraid to ask... but what's this? Where did you find this? Right out in the open in your dresser drawer. A bucket list? Mom. It's not that kind of bucket list. It's just a list of things I want to make sure I do before Christmas ends. Only Santa takes sleigh rides these days. That tree. What a mess. And The Nutcracker? In a town with one stop light? But mom, these things are important to me. The tree, the lights. And this. We could have had gingerbread, any bakery in town. Well, this one had to be mine. Your own gingerbread? Do you hear how that sounds? You're up here all by yourself, no friends, nothing to do. I've got plenty to do. In fact, how do you feel about Christmas pageants? It is so great to meet you, Ellen. Unfortunately the timing is not great. Right, buddy? I can't do it. We will figure something out, honey. Kyle was going to play clarinet while all the ballerinas danced. I can't do it now. Why not? Is your clarinet broken? Mrs. Meechum's ankle is. The ballet teacher. She was going to lead Anna and the other girls in their dance. They've been working on it for weeks. Maybe I could talk to them? Sure. Hey. You sure do look pretty in that dress. It's a tutu. Well, it's tutu cute on you. Hey, I heard that you were maybe thinking about not dancing. We can't. Not without Mrs. Meechum. You know, I used to take ballet lessons when I was just about your age. She didn't think she was good enough so she quit. My daughter's always been hard on herself. I don't know where she gets that. I'm a sugar plum fairy. Is that what you were gonna dance? The Nutcracker. The Nutcracker? Did you hear that? Is there something special about The Nutcracker? I'm not the one to ask. How would you feel about me dancing with you? But you don't know the steps. Well I know you can show me. And the rest of it, we'll just wing it. Here, let's see if these fit. It's like it was made for me. Hey Kyle, warm up that clarinet because these birds are going dancing. Yes! Was that OK? OK? It was amazing! Honestly, that was so good! Oh, darling. I loved it so much seeing you happy like that. Not even caring if the steps were right. They weren't. I know. Everybody knew, but it was wonderful. Thanks mom. I may have been wrong about this place. It has its charms. It does, doesn't it? There's something you don't see in San Diego I bet. What're they doing? School trip up the mountain. Local tire company supplies the tubes and they... it's like sledding. That's sort of like sleighing, isn't it? Dear lord. Mom? You've lost your mind. She's lost her mind. Tell her. Oh, come on. How many times are we ever gonna have a chance to do something like this again? With any luck, never. Oh, no. If you want to throw yourself down a mountain you're on your own. Can you tell me how to get there? It's a locals only place, you'd never find it. But I can take you there. Well, I couldn't let you do that. Let the man take you sleighing if he wants to. Sledding? Tubing. Whatever. We're going. Here are the keys. Bye. Have fun! I will. Are you sure this is the right place? I don't see anybody else around. Let the kids have their own mountain. This is my secret spot. Are you sure you haven't just brought me out here to freeze to death? At Christmastime, with Santa watching? Do you think I'm nuts? Yeah. So what's the story behind the sleigh ride? What makes you think there's a story? Because everything you do has a story behind it. Have you ever seen the movie White Christmas? No, I can't say I have. You haven't seen White Christmas?! Is that the one with the elf? No, that would be Elf. Right. White Christmas is a classic. It's got Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, they sing and dance and fight. So it's just like us. Except for the singing and dancing part. And then at the end there's a sleigh ride and the snow comes falling down and everybody is so happy. I want Rosemary Clooney's happy ending. Snow and all. Well, I... granted, at the end she doesn't go sledding off on an inner tube. I tell you, she does not know what she's missing. Are you ready? I'm ready. OK. Grab a tube. OK. This place is something else. Something else, huh? It's really special to you. Yeah. I used to come here a lot with my dad. He died pretty young and, you know, I felt the pressure to step up, be the man of the house. How old were you? Not old enough. Whenever I wanted time to myself to help put things in perspective this is where I came. OK, about these tubes. Right. What do we do? It's super easy. Throw it down, hop on it, let gravity do the rest. Sounds like a plan. OK. But I want to give you two pointers first. Hey! I said a few pointers! Help! Hold on! Hold on to what?! Just hold on! Are you OK? Are you OK? Is anything broken? Are you alright? I don't care if I broke every bone in my body. I've never been better. You are nuts. I know. That was awesome. You look... Yeah? Wha... wait, wha... I'm sorry. That's my bad. You can't just kiss a person like that. I know. I said I was sorry. You should be. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey, you dropped something. Give that back to me, please. What is it? Christmas Bucket List? Isobel, are you OK? It's not that kind of bucket list. Why does nobody get that? Christmas tree, gingerbread house, The Nutcracker. Is that what Kyle's concert was about? It's personal. It's alright. I just... you need a list to get through Christmas? Doesn't that take all the fun out of it? It's the way my family just spends the holiday anyway. Well, I'm very happy for you and your family. I'm just saying you don't need to force it, you know? Christmas has a life of its own. You just let it happen. Everything will work out. Christmas has never had a way of working out for me. For me it's always been about sun burns and traffic jams and overtime and too many crowds and too much stress. And for once I would really like Christmas to just be perfect. Good enough just won't cut it? Nothing is ever just good enough. I'm so sorry. That must be exhausting. Well I'm sorry that my life offends you. But this is the way I've planned it and this is the way I'm living it. No, no, no, no. Isobel. That's not what I meant. Take me home! How was the sleigh ride? You're home so soon. What are you doing? Well, didn't we agree the lights are all wrong? No, we didn't. They were fine the way they were. Well, we both know they weren't, but now they're perfect. Isobel, what... What're you doing? I'm leaving. This was a stupid idea. Call Brett and tell him not to come. Instead of having hot cocoa by a fireplace we'll have margaritas on a beach. That's probably what he would prefer anyway. Is this about some silly lights? I thought I was doing something... Mom, it's not... I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at myself, OK? I'm mad about the gingerbread house and I'm mad about the lights and the fact that I can't handle one more day of my own unrealistic expectations of myself. At least let me help you fold these. I can't even do that right. Sweetheart. You are so hard on yourself. You've been like that all your life, even when you were young. You wouldn't bring home your artwork for heaven's sake. Well, that's because I coloured outside the lines. You were five. Well, Mozart was writing symphonies when he was five, right? What has that got to do with this? I'm just saying if he was writing symphonies he was probably colouring inside the lines. Alright, you stop this. Stop it right now, because I won't have you feeling this way. I just... I just won't. We need to talk. Your father and I were never a good match. But I tried to make everything perfect. Dinner was waiting and the house was clean if everything was just so... That's how I've always felt. Yes, but the drive for perfection is mine, not yours. I've given you such a terrible gift. Can you forgive me? Oh, mom, there's nothing to forgive. You alphabetize your office supplies. There's nothing wrong with being organized. If it doesn't rule your life. It's taken me all these years to learn this. I just want you to know that the world isn't gonna come to an end if the tree lights are all wrong and if the gingerbread house topples and I don't want you to jeopardize what you have with Jamie because of... Brett. Whoever. I do love you, you know. I love you. Flaws and all. I have flaws? Do you want me to make a list? No! No more lists! Oh, alright. Come on. Let's... let's go call the airport. No, it's OK. I changed my mind. I'm gonna stay. I'm not talking about you. My sister's expecting me for Christmas dinner, you know. And you have your own life to live and your own holiday to enjoy. But if you don't mind, I want to pack my own suitcases. Deal. Merry Christmas, captain. Well, if it isn't the baker. Is Jamie around? No. You might want to try the toy store. Toys and Treasures? The toy store? Hello, there. Merry Christmas. Isobel. Volunteer firefighter, contractor, toy sales. Is there anything you don't do? No, it's my mom's business, actually. I'm just helping out. Mom, this is Isobel. She's visiting from San Diego. Hi. The ballerina. Well done. I'm Kathy. Welcome. Any friend of Jamie's is a friend of mine. Well I'm not so sure we're still friends. I owe your son a huge apology for yesterday. You don't. You don't owe me anything. It's fine. I shouldn't tell you how to live your life. I was out of line. If he says he was, he was. Who's side are you on here? You've always been an honest boy. Santa's gone? Oh, David. Santa and his elf just left. Now how will he know what I want for Christmas? I'm so sorry, honey. You know what? Don't worry about it, 'cause Santa always knows. Maybe he's just gone feeding his reindeer? He's actually gone for the day. He's back there changing. Let me see if I can go catch him. Go. Hey, Jamie? What's up? We are. No. Ho ho ho hold on a minute. It's Santa! And I've got Jingles, my elf. And Santa is open for business! It turns out that I've got time for one more visit before I fly back to the North Pole. Yeah, so why don't you hop on up on Santa's lap and tell him what you want for Christmas? Oh, geez. You're heavier than you look, David. It's David, right? David Anthony Owens. Santa knows my name! Santa knows everything. That's right. So tell me David, have you been a good boy this year? I thought you knew everything. Of course I do, I was just... just double checking. Why don't you go ahead and tell Santa what you want for Christmas? He's got a list. All that? Well, go ahead. Go ahead and tell us. I want a video game, a Super Trooper action figure, a remote control car, a skateboard, a... Why don't, you just let Santa surprise you with something this year? Why don't you just let go of your expectations about Christmas and just let it happen to you? How about that? No. I'd rather have a video game, a Super Trooper action figure, a remote control car, a soccer ball and a baseball mitt. OK. Quite a team, huh? Be honest though, did that Santa outfit make me look fat? Well, a little bit. Excuse me. Jingles the elf here, you've reached the North Pole. Do I... do I have the wrong number? No, silly, it's me. I'm just having a little holiday fun. Oh, fun. I so wish you were here. It's just not the same without you. That's what I hoped to hear. How's the list coming along? It's getting there. I've got so much to tell you about. This has really been the best holiday ever. I... I mean it could be better, obviously. It will be. Listen, Christmas is still three days away, I'm wrapping things up here, I'll be out on the next flight. And keep that elf outfit handy. I have a few ideas I want to run by Santa myself. Yeah? OK. I'll see you soon. Bye. Thanks, my dear. Merry Christmas. That was so sweet what you did with David. Well how many chances am I ever gonna have to get my picture taken with Santa? Not even if you planned it. Jamie said that you're in town alone. If you're not busy, why don't you come over and have dinner with us tonight? Nothing fancy, just family. Are you sure I wouldn't be... I'll pick you up at 7:00. OK. Thank you. I am so glad you could join us for dinner tonight, Isobel. I'm honoured. It's such a family affair. Hey Kyle, did you bring your clarinet tonight? Maybe you could play us something later. Totally. Yeah? You won't have to ask him twice. He gets that from his father. A friendly warning, this one plays the accordion and he's been practicing the "Twelve Days of Christmas." Don't encourage him. I forgot Trish's casserole. Can I help you in the kitchen? No! No, no. You told them! I told everybody. I can't believe you really made all these yourself. Just like my mother taught me. And her mother taught her. Gee, my mother always said if it couldn't be delivered we didn't need it. That really was such a delicious dinner, Kathy. Homemade cooking is all. Some old family recipes and... could you grab those napkins for me, dear? Oh yeah, of course. Thanks. Do these have a special significance? That's a sentimental value. That's Jamie's first construction project. There's nothing that boy couldn't build. Yeah. It helped him through some difficult years. Yeah, he told me about his dad. Really? He doesn't like to talk about those days much. But those blocks, they're just like a... I don't know, a constant reminder of... Reminder of what? Well... Hey mom, what's going on with that dessert? Yeah! I want some pie! The natives are restless. We better get the pie in there. You grab that one, I'll get this one. Can I get ice-cream too!! Coming! I love this. This entire evening. Just a typical family dinner. No, no, no. You don't understand. I was an only child. You have got an entire family of people in there who love you. You actually are that gingerbread family, you know that? Do you even know how special that is? Well, you're right. You know, I never thought of it that way. Look at those stars. Have they always been up there? Hiding behind your city lights. Just like people when they let themselves relax. Oh, shoot. I got something for ya. What? There you go. What, for me? Yeah. But it's not even Christmas yet. It's not even... Just stop. It's not even Christmas Eve until tomorrow. Just open it, it's no big deal. Oh my goodness. A... a tree, a gingerbread house, a sleigh. Can you believe all the charms they had there and not one inner tube? Not that I could find, anyway. What's the question mark? Well that's... that's your secret Christmas wish, right? I don't... I don't even know what to say. This is just the most thoughtful, perfect gift. I didn't get you anything. No, don't. It's fine. The point is I just... I saw something and I thought you would like it I love it. Good. Thank you. So much, for everything. You're welcome. Is that important? Yeah, it's Brett. He's in a cab on his way from Portland. Should... should I bring you back, or...? Probably. Yeah. OK. Thank you. Looks like he's already here. No need to walk me up. Why, are you embarrassed? Is he super short? Does he have a unibrow? Is he like 94 years old? Because you can tell me. No. He's young and handsome and perfectly normal. You can't imagine how sad it makes me to hear that. I wondered what happened to you. Hey! Hey. Who is this? This is a friend I met in town. Jamie Haughton, Brett Bishop. Hey, Brett. Oh yeah, like the company, right? See? I told him all about you. That's funny. I haven't heard a word about you. Why don't you come inside and join us for a minute? No, no, I don't... Come on, I insist. OK. Let's get out of this cold. It's freezing out here! OK. He insists. Alright. Brett. You arranged all of this? This is so... It's romantic. Sit, sit. Jamie, grab that cushion thing there. Sorry about the wine, I specifically asked my assistant for white and he sent red. He'll hear from me. Off with his head! You're serious? So you live up here, do you? Yeah. Yeah, Jamie's family has been so great. They've really been keeping me busy. Well, how lucky for Isobel. I mean, I can't imagine there's much to do in a town this size. Feed the livestock, watch the stop light change. Ha. Yeah, well don't fool yourself, it can get pretty crazy around here. The library got a new book last month. Pandemonium. Sorry about the coffee mug. They only sent two proper glasses with the delivery. What should we toast to? Small town charms? How about to Christmas? To Christmas. Yes. To Christmas. Cheers. Don't break it. I almost forgot. I found your list. You weren't kidding. You have been busy. I mean, look at this thing. Check, check, check, check, check. You know, when Izzy puts her mind to something... That's our Izzy. Believe it or not, most of these things on this list just kind of happened. Oh please, you don't let anything just kinda happen. So come on, what've you saved for me? Well let's see here. We have ice skating and Christmas caroling, I haven't done that yet. OK, ice skating. We'll do it first thing tomorrow, tick it off the list and get this thing back on track. You, sir, look like a bit of a sportsman. Do you know of a frozen lake nearby? There is one actually, but it's not safe to skate on. That's a shame. OK, well, we'll build a snowman, or make a fruit cake. I mean, it's not rally that important what we do, is it? Hey, you know, for what it's worth there is an indoor rink in town. It doesn't open 'til noon but I can probably grab you the keys, slide you guys in early. There you go. Good man. Problem solved. Great, I'll set that up for tomorrow. I should go. I've got family waiting, and... Yes, you should. You should go. Well, it was... interesting meeting you. Yeah, yeah. Geez, what a surprise? Surprises all around. Hey, will you please tell your family thank you from me again? Yeah, for sure. Thanks for coming. Thank you. OK, have a good night. Yeah, you too. Goodnight. Seventh place? I didn't know they gave ribbons for that. I do not see a future for you in gingerbread. You know, I didn't tell you about my trip. Let me tell you, once this factory is set up we can expand into the entire South American market. Argentina, Ecuador, I mean how is that for a New Year's plan? Looks like someone's had a long day. Is your boyfriend sleeping in, Izzy? No, he had some mysterious errand to run. Firing assistants? Trip to South America? Nothing quite that elaborate. I hope. But you never know. Can I give you a hand with that? Yes, please. I don't know what I'm doing. How did you get the key, anyway? I'm very tight with the owner. Oh yeah? I used to work here when I was a kid. You did? Yeah. I did a lot of odd jobs back then to help the family out. Paper route, gardening, car wash. Bicycle repair. Just 'til you found construction? That's right. Building something out of nothing. There's nothing like the feeling of accomplishment, you know? Yeah. And it's always been here? You've never lived anywhere else? No. Well, college. Other than that Fall River's been home. You know it when you find it. You wake up every morning and your heart just feels right, you know? Probably how you feel about San Diego, right? Gosh, I can just imagine how beautiful this must be when it's filled with couples, arm in arm, twirling gracefully around each other. It's actually just a bunch of awkward kids tripping over each other usually, but... You have a very vivid fantasy life. Well, I've heard that before. OK. Alright. So have you... have you skated before? Well... no. No, I haven't skated before. Ever. Alright. You want me to come out with you and give you a few pointers? Yes, please. Definitely. You're on your own. No. Not on my own. We'll fix that fast. This is fun. Oh my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. Looks like I got here just in time. Oh, hey. Hey, Brett. Hey. Do you mind if I cut in? Yeah, of course. Might need to hold onto her. Yeah. Roses? This time of year? Well, you know me when I set my mind to something. Hey, thanks again for setting this up, guy. Yeah. Of course. So you guys, it's yours 'til noon so have fun. Great. Thank you. Oh, hey. Can you put these in some water for us? Sure. Thanks. Yeah. Hi. Hi. Look, I know this doesn't make up for all the time we missed but it's a start. It's a beautiful start. Should we do this? Yes. Now before we get started I just... don't feel embarrassed. OK. It's really slippery, this. I'm gonna give it a shot. OK. Wish me luck. I'm here if you need me. Something like that? A little something like that. How did you learn how to skate? I'm from Chicago, remember? There's nothing else to do in the winters there. Well, that's a good point. Shall we? Yes. Let's try. Ooh, you got it. That's it. That's good! Really good. Are you up for a turn? Yes. This is quaint. I suppose a nice Bordeaux is out of the question. Hey, why don't we just relax and let the holidays happen? Just let Christmas be whatever it's supposed to be. Take it as it comes. That does not sound like you. Where did you hear that? Around. Well hello there. Hi, Patty. This is my boyfriend, Brett. Turkey platter special tonight, all the fixings. What could they do to turkey, right? OK, good. We'll take two of those. All white meat for me, no skin. Instead of potatoes, extra veggies, lightly steamed, gravy on the side. I'm sure I don't even need to say no bread, no butter. No, you do not. I don't suppose you have a gluten free option? I don't suppose so. Will that be it? That's perfect. Thank you, Patty. OK, so we've got the skating thing out of the way, how soon do you think we can get the rest of this list done and just relax? You know what? About that list, we can just forget it. It's... it's silly. I mean, it's been fun but honestly nothing really worked out the way I planned it. I didn't think so. I mean, that gingerbread house? What were you thinking? I don't know. Do you wanna just head back home? You mean it? That would be amazing. I mean, I'm sorry, but this just isn't my idea of Christmas. No. Merry Christmas. I can't forget you. Jamie, you're such a sweetheart. Are you here to join your friends? Hey. Hey. Hey, guys. How was the ice? Great. We're heading to California. What, before Christmas? Fall River's a nice little town but it's just not for us. Right. You'll always have Paris I guess, huh? Paris? So great to meet both of you. Take care. If you're ever back this way look me up, OK? Jamie. What was that all about? I'm sorry, I'm just gonna go clear something up. Izzy. Jamie, wait. Hey, you know we're just friends, right? You're clear on that? What's your point? Well, we're very different people. Yeah, I think we've established that. Several times now, probably. Stop being so agreeable. Isobel, I'm just gonna throw this out there, OK? That guy's not right for you. How would you know? I mean, he obviously cares about you but he cares about himself and his work more. Who would pass up the opportunity to spend a week alone with you? Honestly, he'd have to be crazy. No apologies this time. But I promise you I will leave you alone if that's what you want. Is it? Is it what? Is that what you want? Yeah. I... yeah, of course that's what I want. OK. Nothing else for me to say then. Wait! Everything alright out here? Hey, what is this? Hey, you weren't supposed to open that until tomorrow. We always open our presents Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve morning? I've never been good at waiting, you must know that about me by now. You would think that I would but I didn't. Exciting. It's a... a shirt. For a fashion guy you're pretty quick. Do you like it? Yeah, sure. It's... it's the right size and everything. Maybe a little woodsy. Well, I know it's a little not your usual style but it's perfect for the weather, it's your favourite colour. I got it when I thought we were gonna be up here for a little bit longer. Yeah. Actually blue is my favourite colour. Blue? Yeah. No way. It's the thought that counts and it was a very nice thought. Thank you. You're welcome. And now that we're opening things... You're opening things. Part one of your Christmas present. Part one. Yeah, I... My goodness, what could it be? I called in some favours. And organized a private plane to take us home today. My goodness. That's something. I know, right? And this is a holiday that we can both enjoy. Totally. That's... this is perfect. I know. Let's start packing. OK. Great. So I know we have these international plans but I have this idea for a new line. A main street boutique, my own personal designs. More casual. Izzy... Hear me out. What if the next big thing isn't global? What if it's back home? Small town America? You know? We could open a separate division and do it from, well, anywhere. I don't think so. I... Sorry. It's a text from Hugo. Important? They're all important. Just one sec. What is he doing? Oh, shoot, you know what, I need to check that text. It's Hugo. Does he know it's Christmas Eve? He does, but apparently our new equipment doesn't. But you know it's Christmas Eve, right? Sorry. I just really hoped we were gonna have a chance to spend some time together. Unbelievable. He wants to shut down production for two weeks. No, no, no. There goes half our fabric for the month. You know what? You deal with that. I'll be right back. Sorry, we're just closing. Kathy, it's me. Isobel. Hi. Is there something I can help you with? Oh, no. I was just passing by. My boyfriend and I are heading back to California. Mom, I got four more of these... Oh, honey, I'll put those away so you two can talk before Isobel flies off to California. Hey. Hey. I'm really glad you're here. I was hoping you would be. I hated the way we left things yesterday. Yeah, yeah. That's my fault. I keep... I keep saying things around you that I don't mean. You didn't mean what you said? No, no. No, I did, I mean, the good things, I did. The bad things, I didn't, but you can decide which is which. So this is it, huh? You're leaving? As the song says, I'll be home for Christmas. What is with you and holiday pop culture? I'm sorry. Well, I'm really glad you came here. Even if you didn't make it to Christmas. Maybe I'll get it right next year. Do those still sell? Yeah. Yeah, they do, actually. Always a market for nostalgia I suppose. I saw some like this in your mom's kitchen when I came over for dinner. She started to tell me a story about them. Right. Well, you're not the only one with stories I guess. Care to share? After my dad died I kinda lost myself in work. You know all those jobs I told you about? You were doing what you had to. Just trying to help provide. Yeah. That's what I told myself but I was really just avoiding the feelings, you know? So I made sure I didn't have time for them. That makes sense. Nothing to be ashamed of. No, I know that now. Because I... I found a set of these in the attic and the joy just came back. Just a simple thing, stacking one on top of another. It made me realize that life isn't about a paycheque, you know? It's about living full out. It's about creating something that means something to you and leaving a bit of yourself in the world. Yeah. Yeah. I hope that you find something like that, I truly do. Because you really deserve it. Thank you. I gotta go. I gotta... I gotta do a few things and get home. Christmas. Have a safe flight, OK? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. OK. He's... he's a good man, Isobel. And he has a soft spot for you. You challenge him. He needs someone like that. And maybe you do, too. What makes you say that? I think it's pretty obvious to both of us. The pilot says ten minutes, we'll be on our way. Have I seen that jacket before? Yes, I've been wearing it all day. Plus, you saw the sketches. That's one of yours? Yeah, it wasn't right for the market. Right. Right. Hey, Brett. Did you have any fun? Sure I did. Like what? The... the skating, that was great. Of course, we could have found a rink in California. You know, I really wanted this to be such a special time, Christmas with all the trimmings. You know how important this holiday was to me. I know that everything didn't work out exactly as you had hoped but we gave it our best, right? I know that look. Listen, I know we didn't get as much time as you'd like, but I will be with you as soon as I can see why these figures aren't adding up. I can't go with you to California. No, not right now. What? Something happened to me up here. Your business idea? OK, you know what? That's my fault, I was too hasty. We'll set up a meeting with our distributor in the New Year, you present your proposal and I will keep an open mind. I mean it. I know you will, Brett, that's not the point. It's not about that. So what is it? Is it... is it Jamie? It's not Jamie. It's not anyone. If it is, it's me. OK, well I don't get that at all. I know you don't. And I don't really get it, either. But the simple truth is you have some place you have to be right now and I don't. So I am going to take some time for myself. Here? Yeah, the cabin is paid for through the week. So... What're you gonna do? I have absolutely no idea. Isn't that exciting? Isobel. Carolers! Oh, Jamie, come on. Come, get your jacket, let's go! I couldn't leave until I finished my Christmas list. Caroling? What're you doing? I thought you... I wanna watch. It's either them or hot chocolate with marshmallows. Your choice. Hot chocolate. Let's go. So is this the end of it then? Well, almost. I do have two bits of business remaining. I need to find a construction company to help me with a business I'm thinking of starting. I thought maybe you might know someone. Thinking of branching out on your own, are you? I'd have to find the right shop in the right town first. I'm all over it. That's... that's only one thing, though. You said there were two bits left. I did, didn't I? Well... Right. The secret Christmas wish. Hang on. To kiss a man I love under the mistletoe. Is there a story behind that, too? Not yet. But I'm hoping there will be.
