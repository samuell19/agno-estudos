I know right. So... Ray called earlier today, do you think I should give him another chance? Oh God, Mindy, no. Are you crazy? The guy is mental. I do not know why you were with in the first place. You don't know why? No. Seriously, why? He's like loaded. Oh my god, Mindy you're not right. Amanda don't judge. I've seen you bring home guys too. So what? Just because I don't sound like you, doesn't make yours sound any better. Whatever. The guy is still mental. Still time for coffee? Sure, let's go. It's open. Who's the cutie? Daniel, this is um... Brittney. Britnney and this is Michelle. You better slow down if we're gonna go all night like you said. Don't you worry about me, I'll go all night. Charming. Hi. So how do you know Justin? Um, I... They're call girls Dan. Oh. I'm sorry, I mean, nevermind. So you're coming out with us tonight? That's the plan. So I guess you're mine. I guess so. I like the sound of that. You ready to have some fun? Yes I am. Just remember, you only paid for the company. If you want more, it's extra. Look like enough? All night it is. So what are you like a doctor? It makes a resident. So alls I have to be is a resident in order to live somewhere? wow, you're hot and funny. I like that. And if you were only rich and mute, we'd be the perfect couple. Oh come on now. What do you think? He's cute. He's a resident, do they make money? You crack me up. Yeah, they make a lot of money. Do you seriously not know what a resident is? I do. I mean, kind of, you know what, I bet you don't know either. it's pretty much a doctor in training. Doing his paid practicals. You're something special Mindy. Shut up. I knew that okay. Kiss me. What? Kiss me. She totally saw that. Yep, she did. Come here. What are we getting back at an ex or something? Not an ex, but you know, something like that. So you want something like this? They can't have all the fun. Hey. What can I get you? Tequila. Cabresto. 10 of them. What are you celebrating? Nothing, just having a good time. Okay. Make sure you have a designated driver. I'll be right back. 10 shots of Cabresto. For them? Yep. Huh, what's the occasion? I don't know. Out spending daddy's money. Daddy has money? You know sometimes I really don't understand you. Do you live under a rock? His dad is Senator Stevens, duh. Oh no shit. You know I didn't know that. Obviously. You'd have never turned him down if you knew. Yeah she'd more than likely be blowing him. Right. Alright, I'll take them out. What? Seriously, I'll take them out. You can't be serious. I actually think she's serious. Look ladies, you can keep the tip okay. But watch and learn. Okay. Make my money then. You guys all set? So as I was saying. Yeah I got this place. Alright boys that's $100. What? You don't say hi anymore? Um, hey. So busy night? Yeah, not bad. You said 100 right? Yeah. Let me give you a tip first. How was that? Really fucking hot. Good. Did I say I would share my tip or give you my tip? Give. How's 100? You got 100? Yeah, actually over 100 each. You're kidding. What'd you do? Promise him a blowjob? Shut up. Like it's that far fetched. Look, what else do I need to know about this guy? I don't know but you need to pay up girlfriend. I agree. Thank you. So what do you think? You're crazy. Not like a Hollywood thing. Just us and the camera and the... You really are crazy, you know that right? Bro. We're gonna get Amanda to do it. You think? How? Everyone has a price. So are you guys done with us or what? Done? Fuck no, we're not done. Come here. I said all night didn't I? I guess so. Of course it matters. And I want you to know that I plan on bringing it up and finding out what we can do. Yes. You're wives on the other line and wants to know about doing lunch. Today? Listen, I apologize but I have to step into another meeting. Let's talk soon and thank you again. I agree with you. It's not right and I'm on it. Line four. Would you just tell her I went into a meeting and say it's unlikely. Okay. Thank you. Oh, I hate working out. I should be working on marrying a doctor or a lawyer and letting myself go. You know what? You say some of the craziest things Mindy. It's every woman's dream. Well what about love? What about love? I don't plan on catching feelings anytime soon. Well... How can you be happy if you don't at least try? Buy a jet ski. Have you ever seen anyone unhappy riding a jet ski? Or wait, how about a trip to Hawaii, smiling and taking selfies. Love, it's overrated. Whatever you say. Look, you can go ahead and get yourself paired okay. But don't say I didn't warn you. You suck at life Mindy. I'm a realist. Well, I would rather be a dreamer. I know, I know and sometimes you make me a believer, and then I stop and realize my life and snap right out of it. You know all guys aren't assholes Mindy. There are good guys. Yeah doctors, CEO's and lawyers. And you wanna know what? When you marry 'em, you never have to see 'em. You need help. Sure I do. Hey, take a picture okay, it'll last longer. Told you I'd go all night. That you did. What are you doing this weekend? Um, we're working that bachelor party right? How about Thursday? I'm not sure. You'll have to call the agency and find out. Look there's no need to tell anyone about last night. I mean, most girls like it rough, right? Britt, I have my stuff you ready? Yeah sure. How about one last kiss goodbye? Come on man, we're already late. Pretty sure I paid enough for one more kiss. I think you can do better. See. That wasn't so hard was it? Dan, you want one? Nah, I'm good man. Are you sure? I'm good. Have a good one ladies. Hope to do this again sometime soon. So what do you think? What do I think about what? About making that porno. You really are serious huh? Yeah I'm serious. But why? What the fuck do you mean why? Daniel, why not? So we just set up some cameras and film us banging them? Yes. And why would they wanna do it? Did you see what she did when she saw the money last night? Yeah, so that's different Justin. I bet if I flash some cash Mindy will be game. And I'm pretty sure she can get Amanda to come too. A few drinks later, it wouldn't be that hard I bet. Okay. If you can set it all up, I'm game. How's that? This is gonna be fun. Yeah. So wasn't it like two times a weeK? What? That I would visit you. Oh my god. You're something else. Every Saturday for nine months like clockwork, wow. You're my dad. I am. But still, you're the only person who hasn't quit on me. It means a lot to the old man. That's what families for. Well, at least it should be. That's true. It's what you're all about baby. Okay, not should be. It's what you're all about. I guess. I just try to the right thing and jeez, I am nowhere near perfect. Yes you are. You're my daughter, you are perfect. I'm a wreck. It's okay baby, you have the biggest heart on earth. Yeah well, that doesn't pay my bills. Oh my god I'm behind on everything. I know. Hey, it's okay, it ain't shit. Alright? Look, I'm gonna get out soon, I'll help. We're gonna be okay, you'll see. Alright? Yeah I can't wait. Just stay out of trouble. I know, I know, I'm gonna. No more being a hero. Sometimes in life, a man's gotta stand up for that man who can't stand up for himself. No matter what the consequences. I know. That's why you've been locked up here for nine months. Time's up. Oh. Couple more days. Okay. Can't wait. Let's go bud, you'll be out of here soon enough. Is there anything you want me to tell them? Just keep taking care of things at home, like you do. Okay, I'll try. I know you will, be strong. Okay pops, it's good seeing you. How was your day? Not so bad, yours? Not too bad, but I was really hoping we'd have lunch today. I'm sorry, you know how some days go. Yeah, except I was it was just some days. Please don't start. I don't do this just for myself. I do this for you. I do it for Justin. I do it for us. How come you never ask us what we want then? If you're gonna start, I'll just leave. 'Cause I don't need this shit after a long day. What you need. Exactly. That's what it's always about. For our sake. Hello. Hey dad. Justin. You don't sound too happy to hear from me. What do you want? Can't I just call my dad without wanting something? You could but you don't so... Fair point. I need some money. More money? How could possibly need more money? Well, I'm thinking of starting a movie company so... A movie? Justin, seriously. I'm serious. I've been watching all these indie film videos and I think I could be really good at this. I just need some equipment, so, you know, equipment isn't free. How much this time? I can get what I need for maybe 100 grand. Oh, 100. You know you're always saying I should do something you can be proud of. I can get you 75 but I need see every script before you shoot it, nothing can hurt my position. Of course, sure, deal. Don't make me regret this. I won't. Honey. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean too... I know. But sometimes it's just a lot. I know. Hey this looks really good. - You're favorite. - Yeah. Salmon and au gratin potatoes. Let's eat. Okay. Not like a fishing boat, right? Like a real boat. Like a real boat. Like a glider or pontoon. I don't know what that is, but it sounds nice. Then you should come check it out this summer. I agree. I'm serious. Like everybody else? Alright I take them and we split the tips like we did last time. Sure. Good, 'cause I'm broke. Alright ladies, watch and learn. You gotta be kidding. Make my money girlfriend. Hey sweetie. Well hey. What can I get ya? 10 shots of tequila. 10 shots of tequila again? Mm-hmm. You know that's bad boy juice? Yeah. I like it. Good. Alright, I'll be right back. Okay. She is so hot. So fricking hot. 10 shots of tequila. For the two of them? I don't know, I guess. Coming right up. Alright boys, 10 shots of tequila. That's 100 bucks. Alrighty. Why don't you hang out a bit, have a shot? Well alright. And there's more where that came from. Oh yeah, big spender huh? Little bit. Please have another, we have plenty. Are you trying to get my drunk so you can take advantage of me. no honestly I wanted to ask you something. Have you ever considered being an actress? that's a first. I've heard model. Yeah, yeah I'm sure you have. But honestly, I'm starting my own film company and I think you would be just great. You're funny. You, I mean. Do you wanna come over and have a little test shoot? I don't know. Your friends could come too, and I would pay you. You know what? You're nothing but trouble. You have no idea. So, what do you think? We'll see. So it's all set up, just like that? Yeah, it's all set up. Sweet. Cheers. Cheers. So tell me... That's great. So, are you gonna get on camera too?

Okay, that's good. Mm-hmm. There you go, some skin. More? You want more huh? Oh yeah. Please, please help me! Are you okay? - Oh my god. - What happened? My friend. They killed my friend, Justin and Daniel, they killed my friend. You told Officer Jones someone was killed? Can you tell us what happened? We... Mindy and I we... We went to Justin's place with Justin and Daniel after work. Justin convinced Mindy that he was test filming her for his movie. We were already kind of buzzed and they kept the shots coming. Everything just seemed okay. You realize, I can do whatever I want to you now? Oh you can, can you? Uh huh. And you, you like it. Oh I do, do I? Uh huh. Hold on a second. Oh kinky. Isn't it. Do I get one? No, my other one covers your eyes and I wanna see your eyes. My eyes huh? Well that's a first. Are you ready? I'm as ready as I'll ever be, are you? Of course I'm ready. What the? You into that shit too? No. No thanks. I could tie you up though. Ooh. Careful baby. You like that? Mm-hmm I do. Oh baby. That's a little creepy. Huh, Mindy are you okay? Yeah, just no tighter okay. Sure. What kind of movie is this anyways? It's um... It's an erotic thriller. Am I the lead? You know you are. How about you take this off and let me show you what I can do. Okay. In a minute. Not the hair. Look at me. Hey bro, I think that's too tight. Oh my god. What are you doing? Jeez man let her go, you're fucking killing her. I'm setting her free Dan. I'm setting her free. I said stop! It's too late. She's gone. She's gone. What the fuck? You're fucking crazy. What? This was your idea. That's bullshit. Do you still wanna finish her with this, like you said? What? It feels amazing. Daniel you have to try it. Honestly, if you don't, I will. You're fucking nuts. Don't tell me you didn't always want too? No I didn't, I'm not crazy. What the fuck are we gonna do? You fucking killed her? Dan calm your ass down, I'm thinking okay. She's fucking dead. Yeah, it's pretty fucking obvious. We have to call the cops. Just say it was an accident. No. No cops, I will handle this. You what? Daniel, you better play along too you know. You're an accomplice. I tried stopping you. Yeah, but that's your story so... This is a bunch of shit, there's no way I'm taking... Shh. I hope I'm making myself clear. We are in this together. So you were role playing? I guess. And then what happened? It started out like a fun, crazy night and then it all went bad. What do you mean? Take your time and really think, so we get as many facts and details as possible. He killed her. Who? Justin! Justin killed Mindy. Are you absolutely sure? Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes. Why aren't you guys heading there now? We're sending someone there to check, where did it happen? Justin's. He's a freaking animal and should be locked up. So it was on purpose? Are you not hearing me? He was enjoying it. It was no accident. Look miss, we have to ask these questions okay. Just go get him and that other creep too! Daniel guy? What did he do? Justin said that it was his idea. He gave him a knife to kill me. Okay, we're gonna send a unit out right now. We need the exact address. 1864 Willow. You hear that? Is there anything else that you wanna tell us? Anything you might have forgotten? No. Nothing I can think of right now anyway. Okay, I know this is hard but we need to go through all of this one more time. From the top please. Okay. Hello. Hey. This is office Jones and Santiago from the LOPD, can we come in for a minute? Right now? It's the middle of the goddam night. It'll only be a minute. What's going on? Is everything okay? Mind if we come in. What's going on? Can we please come in? For a minute I guess, I'm exhausted. Woah, woah guys, at least tell me what's going on, you're kinda scaring me. Well that's what we're here to find out. What? Are you alone? Yeah, I'm alone. It's the middle of the fucking night, what do you think? Mind if we look around? Okay look, I've been nothing but cooperative, I let you all the way up here and you're not telling me a thing. Okay, are my parents okay? Can we please look around? Look, either tell me what's going on or get a warrant. Do you have anything to hide? Okay you can leave now, sorry. Sorry. We received a tip that a girl got hurt here. What? We're just doing our job. Can we please take a quick peek. Alright fine, go ahead. So who said that someone was getting hurt here anyway? I'm not at liberty to say. You're not at liberty to say, okay. So you're telling me that someone can just call up, make false allegations and send officers to your apartment in the middle of the night and harass you, is that it? We apologize for the inconvenience. Yeah. Can I got back to bed now? Sure. Again we apologize. Also, I would like to file charges of harassment against this mystery person. That's your right. Okay. Goodnight. Good. Well he's a creepy asshole. Yeah, but he's clean. He's still an asshole. So how long have you known Justin and Daniel? It hasn't been that long. Hey, can you come out for a sec? Sure. Is something wrong? Just hang tight okay. They found nothing. Nothing. Not a damn thing, no body, no sign of struggle, nothing. What do you think? Drugs? Vendetta maybe? I don't know. Let me ask her about drugs. I really don't know how to say this, but are you absolutely certain of what you say you saw. What do you mean? Of course I am. We sent two officers to Justin's place. They went through top to bottom. They found no body, no struggle, no sign of foul play. Oh my god, you can't be serious. Is there any chance that drugs are involved? Are you asking me if I imagined it? No I didn't. Would you agree to a blood test? You're blood testing me? Didn't I just come here with barely any clothes at all? And you think I would do that just because I imagined something? Again, a blood test would clear a lot of things up. This is unbelievable. My friend is dead and you're blood testing me? Miss, we have to rule out all possibilities. Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening. Miss, do you or do you not agree to a blood test. Sure. Whatever. I already told you that we'd been drinking. But I hope you're testing him too. Alright, give us a moment. What the fuck? I don't get it. How is he not in jail? And nothing on the news about Mindy. Are you sure? Completely sure that they didn't drug you? Where's Mindy then? I don't know. Exactly. And how did they get rid of her so quickly? And all of our stuff? I don't know Amanda. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry honey. I can't go to work like this. I understand. Look, should I tell Mindy? I mean if she shows up. She won't show up, she's dead. She's fucking dead why can't anyone understand! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, you know, I'm sorry. You, you have it all. You have everything anybody could ever dream of and what do you do? You blow it. You blow it like you've always blown it. Only this time you have gone too far. Dad I get it. What do you wanna do? You wanna bring me down with you? Is that what you want? You wanna end my political career? Do you have any idea where the money comes from that I give you? No. Because you've never earned a dime on your own. Do you wanna go to prison? It was an accident. Oh an accident. I'm sorry dad. You're a damn disgrace. This is the last time, you hear me. I'm not cleaning up after you anymore. You fuck up once more, you are on your own. I won't. Thanks dad seriously. You better keep your mouth shut and that Dan guy too. Yeah I promise. Get out of here. Go find some way to cleanse your soul and wash this off of you. Yes sir. Cody. Good. I need you to keep an eye on things. Have you found Mindy? No, nothing yet. We got a warrant to search her place. Why are you searching her place? And, jeez have you found my phone, her phone, our clothes, anything? Nothing just yet. Okay, well I've called both phones and they've gone straight to voicemail. We have as well. Well you better not let them get away with this. I should inform you, your blood test came back positive for hallucinogens. What? LSD. You're kidding. No. What can you tell me about that? I don't do drugs. No? Then how is it that your blood test says that you do? Okay, so I smoke every now and then. You know weed, but not regularly. Jeez, I have back issues. I'm not even the killer here, why are we even talking about me? Miss, is there anyway maybe the party got a little crazy and you imagined it? I do not know how times I'm gonna have to tell you, but it's real and it really happened. We've got a warrant to search your place too. What? They're over there now. What the fuck? Miss, don't leave town. Are you Daniel Andrews? Yes. I'm Detective Caldwell can I come in for a minute? No, er yeah, sure. How can I help? Just some questions. Were you at Justin Stevens last night? Er yeah, why? Walk me through your night. Why? Please. Okay, what's this regarding? Mr. Andrews, please. Okay. We went to 2-11. Just the two of you? Yeah. We stayed 'til close and then we left to his place for a bit. Still just the two of you? No. Amanda and Mindy came with us. Oh. And then what happened? We had a few drinks and then we left. About what time did you leave? I don't know, three, three thirty maybe? And who left then? We all did. Where did you go? I went home, separately. And the ladies? I don't know, I'm guessing they went home too. Hmm, that's it. Yeah. Nobody got hurt? What? Nobody got hurt? Why would anybody get hurt? What are you insinuating? You seem nervous. Well a cop comes... Detective. Whatever. Yeah it makes me nervous. You sure you're not nervous because you're hiding something? I don't know what you're getting at. I didn't do anything. Are you saying something happened but you didn't do it? I'm not saying anything until I have my lawyer. Hmm. I could get you a lawyer, maybe even a great lawyer. Could you afford one on your own? What? I know people who could, depending what you're gonna say of course. I wasn't going to. 'Cause I hear you gotta be real careful. Some people have eyes and ears everywhere, if you know what I mean. Yes. Be a shame if I caught you doing something, something incriminating and had to put you down to protect myself. I get it. I won't say a word. Good. Be smart, be safe. Sorry miss, you can't come in. We're almost done here. Why am I being treated like a criminal? I didn't do anything wrong. Sorry miss, it's protocol. Hey I found the cell. What? Hold on. Where did you get that? It was in the chair, must have slipped between the cushions. Can you give that too me? Sorry ma'am this is now evidence. I am not the freaking criminal here! Hey it's me. Dad. It's okay. Hey, what happened here? What happened here? It's a long story. Hey, hey, shh shh. You're just gonna walk with me, let's go. Do you understand, they're killers. Yeah, ooh so am I? Alright, now listen to me. Just stop worrying so much alright. Come on, don't worry about me Mindy, I'm okay. - Really? - Yeah. - Don't worry about you? - Don't. What? Okay, let me talk to them. And if I feel I can't handle it, then I'll call the cops, promise. - No. - No what? Are you serious? You're happy with what you're seeing from the police so far? Just be careful dad. I will be, alright. I'll be careful and you do the same. Now I want you to go to my place and you stay there until you hear from me, okay honey? I love you. Shut the fuck up. I'm not gonna hurt you okay. You're safe. Alright, I just need to know what that crazy bitch has been saying. What? Amanda. I heard she'd been spreading rumors. Rumors? Don't play stupid. I'm not, I swear I don't know what you're talking about. Are you sure? Yes, I swear. Okay, I mean I... I heard that she had been spreading some lies about me and I figured that if she told anyone, she would tell you. No, she hasn't said anything I swear. Okay, I believe you. You should really tell her not to run her mouth though. No good can come from that, you know. Nobody needs to know that I was here. Okay. Amanda. Pick up, pick up. Oh god. So what'd you want to speak to me about? Her father. He just did time for aggravated assault. You think he's gonna be a problem? I don't know yet, but I'm keeping a close eye. And the girl? She's pretty desperate, but I think I have her covered. All her belongings are at her place and clean. Good. And the um... The other girl? We took a few things out of her place and texted her boss that she's sick of it and taking some time off. Text her mom that she's gonna travel for a while. Thanks. No problem at all Senator. This Max guy, he concerns me. What do you wanna do about it? Nothing just yet. If I do, you probably don't wanna know about it. You do what you need to do. I trust you. Thank you Senator. Pathway clear. Um, excuse me? Can I help you? You got a few minutes? For what? A few minutes for a few questions. No, not really, can you please leave? No. You want to hear me, okay. Oh okay, what do you want? A couple things you should know about me. Number one. I'm Amanda's father and there is nothing, and I mean nothing motherfucker, that I won't do for her. Am I clear? Crystal. Number two. If you or anybody who knows lays a finger on her, I will take your head and I will smash it into the fucking pavement until you are unrecognizable and dead. Okay? Okay. Number three and most importantly. Did you kill Amanda's girlfriend? Are you serious? Don't fuck with me. No man, no. I didn't. Okay. They came over and partied for a little bit. You know what, honestly, I heard your daughter's drug test came back bad. She's not a druggie. Whatever you say man. It's you versus the police so... I know my daughter and I know what you did to her you little piece of shit. I do. I don't know what you're talking about. No. You kill broads. Now listen to me. You're gonna slip motherfucker. Get your fucking hand off of me, I'll kill you right here. I ain't afraid of you. I don't give a fuck if your Ted Bundy's cousin. You're gonna slip and I'm gonna be there. I'm gonna fuck you and I'm gonna kill you, okay. Hey tough guy. Huh? What? Yeah? You've never seen anything like me. Not ever. Bye. Hey Jess, I'm here. Okay, I'll be out in a second. Okay. Oh man. Hey. Hey. I cannot believe that he came here. I know. I was freaking out. I need to call my dad. Yeah. Thanks. Hey, bad news. What? Justin. He came by Jess's place, scared her. Are we safe? Shit. I don't know. Let me make a few calls. Now listen, stay in public places as much as possible. And be careful. Okay. Well, we're heading to work. I'll figure something out. Okay. Here. Well, are you ready to go? Yeah. Yes! Hey. Hey, look I got a situation on my hands I don't think I can handle on my own. Okay brother, talk to me. It's dangerous, a woman's been killed. Okay. It's my daughter's best friend. Looks like a cover up. So what do you need? Just have eyes on my daughter. Is that it? Yeah, for now. Okay, you got it. I'll be there in the morning. Hey listen Q, you're a good man, thanks. Later. Come on, stupid idiots. Dad, I'm outside we need to talk. Can't it wait? We're about to go to bed. I don't think this is a conversation we should have over the phone, if you know what I mean. I'll be down in five minutes. Where are you going? It's late. Just a quick phone call. You can't call from here? It's classified, sorry. Okay, well I'm going to bed. I know. I'll do my best to hurry. What's going on? Her father's asking questions. He came to my apartment and pushed me around a little bit. We have eyes on him. I know, I think we're gonna need a little more than eyes. Look, you just lay low and let me handle this. I mean, isn't that why you came to me in the first place? Yeah, but... There's no buts. You just worry about keeping your nose clean. She's telling her friends. And how would you know what she's doing? I talked to Jess. What part of lay low and shut the hell up is confusing to you? I'm sorry, I'm just trying... You should be trying to shut up. Yes sir. I said I'll handle this. Thank you sir. Prick. Hey. I wanna show you this right here. Oh. Oh wow. Caldwell. Yeah. Sure, I'll see you in a little bit. Who is it? Just getting some info on Amanda. Where we going? I got this one, stay here in case anything pops up. You heard about this Max guy? Yeah. I wouldn't worry about him though, I got it under control. Under control? He squeezed Justin. Threatened him. Shit. Can you lock him up for a night or two while we set the rest up? For what? Not my job. He's a hot head, shouldn't be hard to get him to swing at an officer. I don't know. Well think of something, fast. I'm on it. You better be. Look, I can see you're trying to push my buttons. I'm doing the best I can here. I think you can do better. I said I'm on it. So does the Senator. I told you I got this right. For your sake, I hope you do. This guy asked me for my phone number tonight and I gave him my mom's phone number. Hey. Quiet, they'll hear you. Shit. Oh my gosh. I need your phone. Detective Morris. He's at Jess's. What? Who is this? It's Amanda. Daniel is outside. He was outside waiting for us at Jess's place. Are you safe? I don't know, I think so. We didn't see him follow us. Where are you? On 725 Wheaton. We're three houses down outside. Alright hold tight, I'll be right there. Oh my god. Oh my god. What's wrong? Nothing. I can tell somethings wrong. What's really going on? What do you mean? I saw you and Justin. Look, he's gotten himself into some trouble. What kind of trouble? More of the same. I'm trying to help him once and for all get back on track. You need to tell me, he's my son too. He is ashamed Claudia. My poor boy, he doesn't have to be ashamed. You know what? He does. As a matter of fact, you should be ashamed too. Half his problems come from your damn enabling. Oh don't you put this on me. You were never home. And throwing money at a problem like wood on a fire. Oh really. You never said no to the money now did ya? And you were mean. Maybe that's why he's so... How dare you try to turn this on me. That little shit has been nothing but trouble since the day he was born and you know it! He is messed up and there is nothing different that I could have done. He's still our son. Oh, our son? I'm handling it and that's all you need to know. Push my buttons again. Dad, don't! Put your hands where I can see 'em and no sudden moves. It's not him. That's my dad. Officer, I'm Amanda's father and I'm unarmed. Keep your hands there and walk slowly towards me. I said that's my dad! Do as I'm telling ya and you've got nothing to worry about. Okay, I'm unarmed and I'm complying. Alright. Let me sort this out. He isn't the danger, there's someone in her apartment. Hold tight. I'm gonna secure the location. I'm at 725 Wheaton, they say Daniel's inside threatening them. I'm going in. You see a weapon? No, we just ran. How about you, did you see anything? No, nothing. Alright, I'm going in. Put your hands on your head. He's inside. Dad, put your hands on your head. - Okay, okay. - Now. They're on my head. Alright, I'm gonna search you. Okay, that's cool. - Turn around, don't move. - I'm not moving officer. Or I'll shoot you. Is that necessary? Come on it's my daughter. I don't understand what happened. Shh, hold tight. Shut up. Alright, I'm gonna cuff you okay? Why? My daughter's in trouble. You're an ex-con at a murder site. You really need to ask. It's cool, go ahead here. What's going on? Daniel's dead. Shot twice. These two call in a B and E, they leave the premise. I pull up, this guys on the sidewalk. I say we bring them all in. Alright. We need a containment team at 725 Wheaton. We're looking for a murder weapon, gun. And forensics and a coroner as well. I'll rope it off. Go ahead. Alright stop right here. Turn around and get in the car. Morris, be careful. I found the gun right by where he was standing. I'm bagging it now. It's not my gun. How many times I gotta tell you guys, it's not my gun. Look. The gun was found a few feet away from where Detective Morris saw you. I don't care. You were the only one there. Dust it for prints, okay. If I had any gloves, you'd know. Yeah, but prints can be wiped clean. Well test it for particles then. If I fired it, there'd be particles on me. Don't worry. They're dusting the gun, they'll be in here shortly to test you. Okay look, aren't you at all concerned that my daughter reported a murder, and the woman she claimed to be murdered has yet to be found. And Justin's out threatening people and that I wasn't out at the time of this reported murder? Huh? Listen, you're a violent criminal. - So what? - Near the crime scene! Yeah, a gun found right where you were standing. We have enough to hold you and you know it. Where's my daughter? She's giving her statement, we'll release her when she's done. You better keep her safe, you hear me. Do you hear me? Fuckers, keep her safe. Fucking bitch. I swear, I'm not getting fucked over. Perfect. I saw the opportunity and I had to take it. I'll make sure it's worth while. I'm counting on it, sir. So, what's next? We're getting his tests to come back for gunpowder residue. It'll be a pretty open and shut case. Good. And Justin? That's on you sir. You tell me what to do. Make it look like an accident. Should I wait until it's less obvious? No, he's a loose cannon. He's a liability. Better take him out before he causes any more problems. I'll find a scapegoat. Thank you Cody. I'll make it quick sir. It's not me. Hello? Hey, it's Quinn. You're being watched. Go to the kitchen window facing the street. Amanda? Shh. You see that car? That's a cop. We need to meet but I can't go there. I need more cover and I can't get a hold of Max. He's in holding at the police station right now. Shit. Why, what are they saying? Suspecting him of murder, but he is innocent. Okay. Hide the phone and I'll give you a call back again soon. Okay. What was all that about? Lucy? Yes. This is Q, can I speak to your father? No. Well, it's rather urgent. Yeah. Well he's locked up. No. Shit. What do you need? You know I can do pretty much everything he can. Thanks but this is far too dangerous to involve you. I can stay out the way and still get the job done. I don't know. Well, you don't know anyone else that can do what I can do. Other than my dad. No one as good anyways. Timmy will kill me if I dragged you into this. Look, I do tech shit. I don't need to be near the action 99% of the time. I'll be safe, or maybe you just don't need me? Listen if you come you stay low, and then you leave when you're done. Of course. Okay, I'll pick you up in an hour. Make sure you have your laptop ready. You got it. Yes. The particles on your skin, shows gunpowder residue. That gunpowder residue matches the bullets of the gun. This is a bunch of bullshit and you know it. - Is it? - Yeah. I think you're going away for a long, long time. This is un-fucking-believable. You're framing me for a murder. Framing you? Yeah. Detective Morris caught you virtually red handed. Get out of here you piece of shit. I wanna talk to my lawyer. Yeah, I'm gonna enjoy watching you rot away in prison. Fuck you. I want my phone call and I want it now! You get that phone call, when I feel like giving it to you. Here to see my father. Well he's on a call, just wait right here. That's fine, I'll just go in and wait. What can I do for you Justin? Who's taking care of things? What? Who's taking care of things? I think it's only fair that I know, given that it's my life, my future we're talking about here. The less you know, the better. Yeah, I disagree. See here's the thing, mom is at... mom's in a bit of a pickle, and you could really help her out if you just answer me. What? Jesus fucking Christ. Your comprehension is seriously flawed, I mean, who even votes for you? I need names. Jesus Justin, what have you done? Names. Contact information. Now. Calm down Justin. Right fucking now. Thank goodness I found this in your closet. I'm keeping it by the way. Hello. Hey it's Quinn. Listen up carefully. I want your friend to go outside to distract the cops, and I want you to sneak out the back door so you can meet me. Is there anywhere you can meet me out of sight? I don't know. Behind the shopping plaza. Okay, where exactly is that? It's half a mile north of me on Main Street. Alright, I'll be there in 20 minutes. Hey. Don't make me regret this. Trust me, you won't. I need a favor. What? I need you to distract the cop as I sneak out to see Quinn. Okay. I can do that. Then what? I don't know. Stay safe. Are you sure you can do this? I got it Amanda. Thank you. Is everything okay sir? - Out. - What? I said out. Come on, come on. Yes. Cody, where are you? Waiting outside his place. I need you to go check on Claudia. But I... Now. I'm on my way. Senator where are you going? I'm out for the day. Is everything okay? Can I help you? It's cold. Can I have your cigarette? See the thing is, I really want it. Move along please. I said I want your cigarette. Amanda this is Lucy. Lucy meet Amanda. Nice to meet you. You too. This is Max's daughter. First things first we need to get Max out. How? He's locked up at the station. Let me take care of that. I need you to tell us everything Amanda. Okay. So, we decided to go to Justin's place for an after-party. When we first got there everything seemed fine. Claudia! Oh god. The game has changed Cody. I'm listening. I want him alive. Yes sir. He will pay for this, I promise you. I'm gonna show him pain he's never imagined. Okay. Well let's get him out. Okay, let's go. I need to hard wire in. Okay, let's see what we can do. You can't keep me in here without charging me! You got a long way to go before your 72 hours are up. Oh yeah. Were you born black or is that just a tan? Huh? Is he still screaming? Hasn't quit for a second. Hey, is Mandy safe? Please tell me that much. Tell me that much. Fuck you, I don't have to listen to your bullshit. Yeah you do. You gotta listen to my bullshit. Oh on the phone, big shot. - Hello. - Got a phone call and shit. What? Woah, woah, woah. No, hold on, not on the phone. Got it. Who was that? None of your fucking business. You dirty fuck. Let me out of here! Motherfuckers let me out of here! Let me out of here. Okay, security systems... Almost there. How we going? Almost there. We're in. Sweet. Great. Just let go. Let's see. Do I even need you anymore? Do I? Open it. You know what? Just in case. Let me out of here! I said. Hey. Yes. Justin. Dad. Where's Cody? Oh, I'm afraid he can't talk right now. Can I take a message? I'm gonna put an end to this, do you hear me? If you think a spanking is gonna do it this time, you're mistaken father. Where are you? I can't make it that easy for you now... Listen to me you little shit. I want his punk ass dead. Do you hear me? Sir, not on the phone. I said dead! Oh no. No. Prisoner has escaped. Prisoner has escaped. Lock down now. Oh my god. How the hell did he get out? I don't know. Who else was in here? Me? I don't think anybody after me. Oh come on. Come on what? You saying I had something to do with this? No, I'm trying to figure out what the hell happened. Hang on. Officer Jones was in here before me. Officer Jones. Yeah. Officer Jones. Yes sir. Where are you? I'm in the lunch room, I was eating. I'll be right there. This is some straight up bullshit. He's gone. I think we should've invited you instead. I wonder if we'd be in this mess if we had. You know, you do have lovely eyes. I wonder what they look when the lights turn off. Sit tight. You're not getting away. This is it, you psycho little shit. Shh. You can't run forever. Goodnight dad. Oh man, I cannot get a hold of Jess. Okay look, I'm gonna see what I can do. You need to be careful. Sure. I'm coming with you. Look, you're in deep enough, I'm just gonna check on her. And I'm coming with you. Better safe than sorry. Okay but keep your head down. Man I've got you. Let's go. Officer down. Officer Santiago is dead. I repeat dead. I'm at 4045 Wheaton, requesting back up. I'm inside, place is secure. There's another body. Unknown male, send forensics. Yes. It's detective's Morris and Caldwell, can we come in? Sure. Justin? We just wanna talk. Hello. Did you know your partners dirty? What? He's on Senator Stevens personal payroll. Who is that? Hold on. Justin? Yeah sorry I couldn't stay, but I thought you should know. Just watch his reaction when I call his phone. What? What the hell was that all about? I have no idea. What's he want? No clue. Hello. Did you see it? Did I see what? You know what. Now who is it? Okay, you want more proof? Go look in the bathroom. What the hell's going on? Hold on. Fuck. Damn. Hello. I know and so does your partner. Yeah, you know what? Shut your fucking mouth you little piece of shit. What the hell is going on around here? No fucking clue. How do you have Senator Stevens phone number? Fuck if I know, I must have worked an event or something. Talk to me. You're gonna shoot me now? Come clean with me Caldwell. We've been partners for seven years. You don't trust me? Huh? I'm sorry. Shit's getting to me. Shit's getting to all of us. Keep your head clean and clear. That's how we get through this. You're right. I don't think he's here. I know. I'm sorry, I'm not going out like that. Officer down, officer down requesting back up at Hello. Well hi. You're a giant pain in the ass, you know that. I'm gonna take that as a compliment. Let's make plans. What? Come see me. Why would we wanna do that? You want more blood on your hands? She's already on borrowed time, honestly I don't know how much longer I can hold off. Um... Yeah I'll come. Look I'll come, just leave my daughter out of it okay. Oh no, that won't work. Keep the phone, instructions coming soon. Let's go. Don't worry, we'll get her back. Yeah. Let's go do this. Better do it. Now. I've got to go run a quick errand. I'll be right back so don't worry. Don't go anywhere. Lucy can you find someone who called this phone? Sure. And can you make it as fast as possible please? Sure thing Max. Thanks. What's going on? He's got Jess. He's completely lost it. Dead bodies all over his apartment. We've gotta stay away from there okay. Bingo. Oh my god. Got something. What you got? I'm pinging his location now and... There. Industry area, just off the town. Yeah, that's not far. Hey, you're staying here. And so are you Lucy. Dad, she's my friend. Too bad. Okay 1 1 2 0 0 Attwater. Oh let me see that. It's him. Hello. I'm ready for you now. Yeah you sick fucker. You really don't understand? Understand, what is there to understand? You don't get it. It's not the same reason for all of them but... You know I'd love to tell you and your lovely daughter in person. She's not coming. You sure abut that? If I get disappointed, I'll have to take Jess's life early. I'll be there. What's that? I said I'll be there. 11200 Attwater. Come alone. If I see anyone else, I'll kill her right away. Do you understand? Oh and come unarmed. See you soon. Fuck you. Same location you got huh? Yep. Oh god. Oh alright. We better get going huh? Stop there. Show me that you have no weapons. Her too. Well done. You just let her go. That's close enough. Okay. You're a sick piece of shit. Shh. Maybe I'm just awake. You mean, killing people makes you feel like you're awake? You really don't get it? No. So you feel like you're alive when you kill somebody? No, I never felt like that. I have seen people when they can't possibly lie to me. I've seen people when they can't possibly ignore me. Okay. Like Mindy for instance. Treated me like I was nothing. Gave herself to me, body and soul, when I made the right promises. Or my father for instance, now that was special. I'll never forget the look on his face when he realized, finally he'd lost. He'd lost a contest for once in his life. It was too me. Oh he hated that. My mother though, that may be my favorite, because I never knew she had such a pure soul. Honestly, she couldn't believe it. Even as she bled out, and she faded away she never stopped believing in her baby boy. And I'll always have that. Honestly the cops I killed, were mostly just in the way. And there was Cody. Piece of shit Cody, right. But honestly, really, you can't tell me you've never felt that. No, I never did that. I kill people who try to kill me usually. Or I kill people that are bad, like yourself. Hey look, Justin, really just listen to me. Hey, snap out of it okay. We're on earth. This is earth and murder is against the law and you're not gonna get away with this. I mean, you don't think you're gonna get away, I mean you kill the three of us and all those other people you've killed, but you don't think you're gonna get away with this, do you? What do you even mean by that? It's such a vague term. You can't be serious. Oh I'm quite serious. You know what you are really? Fuck all the games here, you know what you are? You're the bacillus of infection. And for your low IQ, small brained ass, that means you're the bottom of the pimple. The bacillus of infection, you know you've gotta be popped out for it too heal. You're that sick alright. And there's nothing special about that at all, okay. And you got a bad haircut on top of everything else. To you perhaps. In your eyes perhaps, sir. But that's because you're just like me. You have the beast inside. I've seen the darkness behind your eyes. I know. And when I kill you, and I will, I'll be complete. That's some kind of special baby. That's some kind of special. Yeah. But that's enough. What's that? Come here or she's dead. Okay hang on, hang on. Don't, don't, no. No, no, no. Hey, listen to me. Come on, aren't you enjoying this? Seeing me tremble like this and my daughter? It's gotta be fun for you right? Look how frightened we are. I mean, that's my daughter. I would rather die a thousand deaths than her ever be harmed. Aren't you getting a kick out of this? So give me a minute here, alright. You got the big bad wolf really afraid. I'm gonna start crying. So, get a thrill out of this alright. There's a thrill murdering right? Now, I wanna make you a deal. You let these two girls go and you kill me, okay? Okay let's make this last a long time. You kill me really slow, you know. You cut me, you kill me with papercut's or some shit but you let them go and kill me. You'd do that for me? Yeah. Okay. Come here. Um. Now! Let's go come on. Oh my god. Done. Hey my sweeties, it's over. It's all over. It's over. Don't look at him, don't look at him.
