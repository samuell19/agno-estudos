Would he be willing to do any building work, or anything like that? And could you just sign his contract? Have you mentioned that? There. She's a nurse. For 28 years. That's quite experienced.

And he can start work straight away? Yes, OK. Brilliant. - We can guarantee you work. - (Woman translates into Polish) Good, clean accommodation... No visas required, as you know. And, also, it's very straightforward and all above board. - I'm a teacher. - Oh, OK. Unfortunately we wouldn't be able to get you work as a teacher. Would she be willing to do anything else? Like caring, or... - Yes, as an au pair girl. - As a... - As an au pair girl. - OK. That's fine. Building, factory working, gardening. I can even feed your goldfish if you need. - Um...

You are absolutely crazy. That's me in this picture. - (Chuckles) Oh, my God. - Look at this one. That's dangerous. That is steep, that is high. Dangerous! We climb on the roof and put ball inside chimney. - What, and you do that? - Yeah. - Why? For fun. - Oh... - Angie, your drink's over here. - All right. What's the matter? Come over. All right, OK.

Fit as a fiddle. - What the fuck are you doing? - My hand's on your arse. - What are you doing? Calm down! For fuck's sake, Anj! Are you all right? I've put up with those pricks for six months. Shit, I forgot my bag. Room 109. You can feed my goldfish. (Man) We've got to let you go. (Angie ) It's not making sense. I'm the best worker you've had. I don't care. I've got good targets and you know that. - (Man) I understand that. - There's been a mistake. Head office have told us the information. (Angie ) Stop going on about head office. You can do something. We understand how upset you feel, but... All the clients I've given you. All the clients I've handed over to all you lot. For what? I mean, for what? Just to go and that's it? (Man) There's nothing we can do. I understand you're angry. Feel free to give our names as a reference when you need one. (Man) We'll pay you to the end of the month. (Angie ) Do you know what? I could make a complaint against you. - (Man) Do what you've got to do. - (Angie ) I will do what I've got to do. - You know what pissed me off? - What? Them. Telling me all a load of bullshit. I was set to be associate director in three months. What a load of rubbish. Do you know what I mean? I had such a day. I've lost my mobile I've lost my job, my mobile, and I'm soaking wet. - I know. I know. - What an idiot. Take this. Go on, let's go in the room. - So what are you gonna do now? - Dunno. I just feel like an idiot. That's what I feel like. A mug. I'm 33, Rose, I mean... I'm 12 grand in debt. I've got a string of credit cards. One shitty job after another. I don't know what to do. I'm friends with a supervisor. Maybe I can get you a job at the call centre. Are you having a laugh? Rose, you're a fucking graduate. I mean, what are you doing? What's that supposed to mean? Well, you know, you're just treated like a door mat. Also, how much do we take home at the end of the month? - Not a lot. - But who gets a fat bonus? - Not us. - Yeah, not us. Exactly, Rose. Exactly. What are we doing? - Do you know what I'm gonna do? - What? - I'm serious. - No, go on, tell me. I'm gonna set up my own agency. (Giggles) You're pissed! - Don't laugh. It's not funny. - You've had too much to drink. No, I've been thinking about this long and hard. I know this job back-to-front and inside-out. I know what I'm doing. - You're always talking, woman. - No, I'm not talking. I'm doing it. And no more orders. Never again. That's what I said earlier. No more. Unless they come from me this time. But also... from you. Anj? There you go. Your cocktails are ready, honey. Honestly. I need you, Rose. I really do. - All right, Andy? - How are you? All right? Listen, I want to ask you a favour. You know that yard in the back? - Uh-huh. - Anyone using it? - I don't know. Jerry? - Yeah? - Anybody using the yard out back? - Anyone using that? - You're not growing leprechauns in it? - No. - Just for deliveries. - Just for deliveries. Could we look at it? After you, Anj. - Rose... - Ta. How far to the North Circular, then? Round the corner. You can hear the traffic. Look, it's got high walls, privacy. What more can you ask for? Shelter. It's great. Great access. (Jerry) Are you planning an ambush? I could fit 150 in here, no problem. Just a place to get picked up from. Know what I mean? A place to get picked up in the mornings, to meet. In my last job, they used to literally stand outside in the street. (Jerry) Casuals? You mean, like, paid by the day? By the hour. This could really work. (Jerry) Yeah. You got bus routes. Underground's nearby. Good parking. (Rose ) Anj, what you doing? - We can just start. - (Rose ) You're joking. This is my last chance. I need you. I can't do it by myself. - It's not that simple. - It is. It isn't. We've got no papers. No licence. No bank accounts. - We've got nothing. Not even an office. - We've got a flat. - It's not even your pub. - I'll just cut a deal with Jerry, yeah? - Yeah. - Is that all right? What about tax and VAT? Nothing shows for six months, and by then we'll be flying. - You're working too fast. - No, I'm not. - I can't do it. - Yes, you can. No, I can't. All I need now is a motorbike. - A motorbike? - That's it. Calling yourself Evel Knievel? How much can you get on your credit card? - Have you heard of our agency? - I haven't, no. Well, you will do.

You're gonna be working that many hours. 15, 16 hours a day. Do you not think I know that? I know that. I've got a wee office job where I need somebody. Kind of... Get a job in a nursery or something. Anj, guess what? Tony phoned back. Tony. From the shirt factory. (Rose ) Yeah, and he wants to see you now. (Rose ) Yeah, now, so you'd better go.

I swear, bring me back to the old days. No complaints. They kept their heads down and kept that fucking quiet. Now they've got a bit of paper, they think they own the joint. Tone, don't worry about it. All right? I'll fix you up. - I'll get you a good rate. - Good. That's why I phoned you. No problem. But what about a cheque?

Listen, guys, I think you're all a bit too fat. Just budge up. Quick. All right, you'll just have to manage. You've got to go. Go on, then. Go on! Sorry, I don't understand. Thanks very much for coming in, but you have to go now. - You have to go. - You don't give me the job? It was first-come, first-served basis, and you were too late. - OK? If you'd like to go now. - (Speaks Polish) If you'd like to go. Now? Can we all just be quiet and maybe we'll get somewhere? Right. The reason you didn't get work was because you arrived too late today. Tomorrow you will have work. Sorry about that. See you tomorrow. Any work, please? I do anything. - Where are you from? - Spain. I don't think so. Where's your passport? Iran. But I do anything. - Any kinds of job. - Have you read this? What's this say? No papers, no work. - Don't waste my time. - I do anything. Don't waste my time. You heard me. - Can you get the internet on that? - Mm-hm. - Can you get the internet on yours? - I just got an email from Michael. Oh, take it down. Can you get pornography and stuff? Can you surf the web and stuff? Fucking hell. This is amazing, ladies. Bob Dylan was right, by the way. The times are a changin'. I tell you, I've got to hand it to youse two. This is progress. Totally. She's a contact in Cranford. I'll tell you something, Anj. See, 20 years from now, maybe less, youse women are gonna rule the roost, by the way. Nae ifs, nae buts. Tits on the top, I'll tell you, ladies. It's gonna be great. I don't know. And let's take cloning. See, with cloning now, right? Men are gonna be completely useless. Nobody'll need men. Won't need us. I keep telling my mates. And they don't even see it coming. Bunch of fucking numpties. - Enjoying the hot dog? - Great. Really good. - But I tell you, look at you... - Don't talk with your mouth full. Tapping away on those Blackberries like ballet dancers. Look at my fingers. I'll not get a fucking look in. I'm fucked. I've not got a chance. Don't worry, Andy. Keep you as a pet, yeah? Yeah. Aaah! (Phone rings) Oh, God... Hello? Hi, Dad. All right? All right. Oh, God. I forgot. I'm sorry. Shit. I'm coming now. - All right, then. Bye. - What's up? - Oh, shit. - What's up? Jamie. I'm meeting him. I've got 15 minutes to get there. Outside the school, there's a meeting. Oh, God... (Children laughing and shouting) Would you like to tell me your side of the story? Jamie, this is very serious. You broke his jaw. - Jamie? - He's on his way to the hospital now. Jamie, what happened? Come on, Jamie, it's safe enough here. Just tell us what happened. Tell Grandad, Jamie. He won't be cross with you. As you can appreciate, the parents have contacted the police. The matter is now in the hands of the Crown Prosecution Service. And, following reports, it will be referred to the Youth Panel. I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend him. - The Crown Prosecution... - Mr Doyle! What I need from both of you right now is a guarantee, before you're even allowed anywhere near the school, is a guarantee it won't happen again (Angie ) We can guarantee that. - Jamie, I need to hear that from you. - Only he can give that guarantee. - We can talk about it at home. - Jamie, say you're sorry. - Jamie, we're going home later. - I'll never break his jaw again. Jamie... Look at me when you say that, please. - I'll break his bloody neck instead. - Jamie! Look. You know, I'm doing it for Jamie, so what more can I say to you? - Jamie needs a mother. Not a stranger - Jamie's got a mother. That's what you're becoming. A stranger. - No I'm not. - You are. He needs you now. Why don't you come home? - And me and Daddy will help you. - I'm not doing that. No way. Listen, it's six months, yeah? That's all it is. In six months, I guarantee, we'll be set up for life. - Jamie will have everything he wants. - How many times have we heard this? All I can tell you is, time's running out, love. It really is. And I tell you, you won't be young forever. "You won't be young forever." God, how many times have I heard that? You may well have heard it a lot of times. God, you're so boring, Mum. You've heard it lots of times, but you've got to get yourself organised. I am organised! What do you mean? Do you understand? I get up at five in the morning. I come home at nine some nights, working with Rose. - I'm not saying you're not working hard. - Well, it sounds like it. This could lead from one thing to another... - You've got to get your act together. - Get my act together? I can't believe you... That is it. I'm not coming round no more. I've had enough. This is just silly. Mum, just shut up, yeah? Shut up. That's clever, that is. You've done it now, ain't you? It's not fair. Angela... Jamie is angry, and he's upset. And me and you both know he's not had a very good deal in life. - You understand that, don't you? - Yeah, course I do. This year is gonna be the hardest year of his life. I know he's only young, but next year he's going to the secondary school. With all that entails. Small fish in a big sea. Different area than where he's been used to. It's important that we help him. Yes, Dad. Jamie? Jamie? Talk to me. What's going on inside that head of yours? Come on. - Just tell me what happened. - I just don't want to be there. They always call you names, and call you a slag and that. And today they're all just singing songs. Just, like, one of them has to carry on more than anyone else, and... I just hit him today, like, because he's an idiot. I hate him. You've gotta ignore him, all right? He's just jealous. Forget about him. I know, but it's just not as easy as that, Mum. When they say stuff about your mum, it's not exactly that easy. Yeah, but you're cooler than that, Jamie. You got to keep your cool. Yeah... - Haven't you? - Am I gonna see you in the morning? No, Jamie. I'm off far too early, all right? See that black down there? The one with the blue T-shirt on? Yeah, I know her. - Carolina. - Yeah. I can't see him now. Where's he gone? The little bastard's hiding. Anyway, Igor... The young guy there, just hiding behind the pillar. - Yeah, OK. - He knows we're talking about him. (Tony) He's doing some work now. Unbelievable. (Angie ) Oh, God. Oh, yeah. Hold on. Hold on. Oh. And that bloke down there. - Who? - The guy with grey shirt and red trim, scratching his bollocks. - (Angie ) The one with the shorts? - (Tony) Yeah, yeah. (Angie ) He's got a gold chain on. I can see it from here. (Tony) He's in a world of his own. Look. - That's it, they're going. - I don't want 'em back here. No. No problem. We'll get replacements tomorrow, first thing. - I didn't mean that to happen. - How is it with you? Um... Well, to be honest, things are a bit tight. - But, you know, we'll manage. - It's early days. If you need room to breathe, I got this mate down in Kent. Runs recruitment. It's a massive salad factory. He supplies all the chains. He's got this infra-red machine, right? You know what that's for? To make sure passports are legal. No. To make sure they're illegal. But it covers his back, see? See, if they have a valid passport, that equals no job. They're scared shitless. He don't get no back chat. - Really? - No. Do you want his number? Are you joking? You are kidding, aren't you? No, thanks. I don't want Immigration sniffing round, risking 5 years in prison. Look. I want to show you something. Come on. (Angie ) What's this? Take a seat. That is an eye opener. It's the Crown Prosecution case against one of the biggest gang masters in the country. I mean, this geezer had hundreds, hundreds of illegal workers all over. You know? Know what they did to him? - They sent him a warning letter. - Shut up. I don't believe you. It's true, man. Read it. It's a joke. The only reason he got caught was cos he was too greedy and he was too stupid! And you ain't going to get caught on your level, Angie. Honest. You've got more chance of winning the lottery. Karol? Karol! (AII wolf-whistle and jeer) Katowice, remember? Yeah. How could I forget? Accommodation was shit. Bus trip was shit. Job was shit. A very good memory. Thank you. Stolen L250 from 50 of us. - Very good memories. - Honestly, I didn't know anything. You know, the only good bit was the goldfish. It was good joke. Thank you. I got fired from Poland. After Poland, I got fired. They're all liars. They tricked me, too. They did the same to me. - I'm telling you the truth. - Are you really? - Yes, honestly. - I'm sick of lies in this country. Honestly, I am. - Are they your workmates? Just gone? - It's my van. Get on here. I'll give you a lift. We'll catch 'em up. - Yeah? - Yeah. Come on. (Horn beeps) (Speaks Polish) Who runs this place, then? The guy in the Mercedes. And where are these people from? All over. Brazil, Afghanistan, Poland, Ukraine, Iraq. They were promised work and told lies to. Third World here in London. - Thanks for the lift. - Oh, OK. Do you want drink or something? Typical Polish speciality, if you want. I have to check. Yeah, why not? You're not having seconds, you know. Really? - Am I forgiven? - Yes, possibly. Those pants. Typical Polish pants. Built to last. (Angie laughs) That was very... tender. Tender? - Is the word? - Mm. Tender. That's the word. Anyway, listen, I've gotta rush, OK? I've got to get out of here. - What are you doing? - Tell you tomorrow. - Tell me now. What are you doing? - This might cheer you up. You know that big fish factory job? We got it. It came through. Shut up! You know what, right? I can rent a two-bedroomed house a mile away - for L280. - So cheap as that? Yeah, well, it's middle of nowhere. So... A double shift at the factory. This is what we can do, right? A double shift in the house. Get what I'm saying? Right. We put four guys in a room, say bunk beds. Right? We charge 'em L50 per week per guy. And we multiply that by the double shift and... Let me just work it out. Different shifts, same bed? Is that what you're saying? They're near the coast. Be all right. Keep the buggers warm. - That's disgusting. - Oh, my God... (Chuckles) Do you wanna know how disgusting? Look. We'll be making over three grand a month. - What, from one house? - Yeah. Flipping 'eck. My God. Imagine that. Yeah, imagine. Imagine one and then imagine two. - A lot more. - Mm. No, man. It's too scary. It's just too much cash. It's too much. We're gonna get caught, Angie. - We're not. - We are. It's too much money. - No, we're not. - Over three grand? We're not. I've just sussed it. - What? - I know what we're gonna do. We're gonna set up a breakfast bar in the beer garden. Rosie's Diner. It's the perfect cover. Don't worry. You're not worrying, are you? - Course I'm worried. - Rose, look at me. It's a few months. Then we'll be legit. OK? I promise you that. It's a promise. I swear to you. Right. We've got Raphael, Kramer, Somers. Yes. Who's saying yes? - Yes. - Can you go to the white van? Mason, white van, then, please. Thank you. Navid, white van as well. Sylvia, that's over there. No, sorry, in the green van. Sylvia? Yes? In the white van. Barkos. Right. OK. Over there in the green van. Andy? Andy? What are you doing? This is full of Polish women looking for a husband. - Full of what? - Women. Polish women. I really don't care. Do you know where they're going? - (Andy) They're in the green van. - Can you get them in there? Thanks. What's your name? Yeah, it's the green van. Go over there. Excuse me. Gift for you. - Sorry? - This is a gift for you. - Why would you give me a gift? - Because you found me perfect job so I would like to thank you. OK. Thank you. Oh, that's very sweet. That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. No worries. Listen, good luck in your job. I wish you all the best. Thanks. Thanks very much. We have overheads and things like that. We need to deduct this for you. (AII complain) No, no, no. In this country, that's how it goes. Excuse me. Can I just ask, what's going on? (Speaks Polish) Listen, mate. Listen. Oi, mate. Excuse me. That's your hours, that's your total. If you don't like it, go. No, no, no. Tax, national insurance. Where do you reckon we get it from? - Your tax isn't my problem. - Reckon we should pick it from a tree? I work for you all week. You must pay me L200 per week. - We'll sort it out later. - Where is my money? - Where is payslip? - If he doesn't work, he won't have a job. - Tell him. - (Speaks Polish) Come on, then. We'll sort it out later. Right. Thank you, thank you. (Angie ) That's it. Look... What have I told you before? No papers, no work. Get out! Now! Hey, thanks for helping us out there, all right? I really appreciate it. - Thanks a million. That's great. - It's all right. I'm gonna nip over the burger van. I'll be a few minutes. Got that contract, Rose? - That's Karol's a lovely guy. - You OK? Yeah, I'm just a bit shaken, that's all. Just the way they looked at us. Look 'em straight back in the eye. Don't be intimidated, Rose. - They should be grateful. - I know. Karol asked me if we really paid the tax. - And? - Well, he believed me. Look, Rose, you've got to calm down. Stop panicking about things. Once we set up the office, we'll pay enough tax to build a motorway. - We'll pay it eventually? - Of course. Don't be afraid. Just come in. (Mahmoud) Please come in. (Speaks Persian) Come in, please. - My wife Mahin. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. My two daughters Sheeva and Shadeh. - Please, have a seat. - Thank you. - (Mahin) Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. Thanks anyway. (Mahmoud) We have been hiding about 12 weeks now. - How long have you been here? - (Mahin) Nearly four weeks. The shopkeeper has been letting us stay here. (Angie ) It's freezing in here. It's horrible, especially at night. So cold for the children. (Angie ) What's your name again? - Sheeva. - (Angie ) And you are? - Shadeh. - (Angie ) How old are you, Sheeva? - Nine. - And you? - I'm 11. - You're the same age as my son. - (Shadeh) What's his name? - Jamie. He's at school at the moment. Why aren't you at school? - We don't go to school any more. - Don't you? We had to take them out of school. - Why is that? - They are frightened of being picked on. All right, girls. Go in first. Go on. (Angie ) Can you close the door behind you? - Hiya. What's going on? - There's Shadeh and there's Sheeva. - Just go through. - What's with the bags and everything? We're just freezing. Hi. Hi. So what's happened, then? Where shall I start? I'm from a family of booksellers. During the Shah back in 1953, my father was arrested for publishing critical authors and supporting Mossadegh, our prime minister. Elected. (Mahin) Mahmoud was arrested and beaten up about three years ago, again, for selling the wrong type of book. So we fled the country and we came here. We claimed asylum but we were rejected. And they asked us to leave the country. So we had this terrible choice to make. Either go back to Iran where they put him in prison or just go into hiding as a family and wait for the consequences. Listen. I'm gonna try and help you out. You can stay tonight. You can stay for the evening. And you're welcome to anything. Take whatever you want in the fridge. If you're hungry, you just help yourself. - (Mahin) That's very kind. - No, it's fine. Honestly. It's fine. And tomorrow I'm going to try and get you a job. OK? I'm gonna do my very best to place you in a job. As far as accommodation, I do know someone who's got a caravan site. And they could possibly try and help you out there. - Anj? - Hopefully by tomorrow evening. Can I have a word? - Rose? - What? - What are you doing? - What do you mean? I'm just trying to help a family get off the street, get out of that shit hole. You're not Mother Teresa, you know. There's thousands of 'em out there. Once you start getting involved, you're hooked. - Why did you say you'll find him a job? - I am going to. - And get five years in prison? - Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. I won't calm down. This is serious. You're talking about illegal workers. (Rose ) You don't get it, do you? (Sighs) You're on your own. Won't be a minute. Just got to go and see Rose. I've just got to show her something. Be back in a second. - All right, Rose? - No. You drive me fucking nuts. I'm sorry, Rose. OK? Look. I wanna show you something. Look at this. This is a real case against a gang master. - Just one. So what? - Yeah, but if you read it, false papers were given to hundreds of illegal workers. And did they get arrested? No, they didn't. Do you know what happened? They got sent a warning letter and that was it. You promised me you wouldn't take any more chances. Look. Think about it. If they can send a warning letter out to a Mafia boss, what do you reckon they'll do to me, a pathetic single mum? Zero. And look, you've gotta think about it. Look what we're doing. We're giving these people a chance. Mahmoud downstairs. If I was him, I'd wanna meet someone like me. (Speaks Persian) I'm Spanish? - I'm French. - Italian. (Speaks Italian) You've gotta know this. It's very important. L20 a week of your pay for your passport is what you'll be charged. That comes off. You do understand? Can you explain it? Now, listen. You won't get paid the full rate. It's hard work. I won't lie to you. Also, my boss has done me a favour here, all right? You can't let me down. You understand? Can you explain? Thank you very much. How's the caravan? - We're safe for now. - Good. Good. Can you back off, please? Otherwise none of you are gonna get work. You over there. Construction. Are you a student? Yes, you are, you liar. Go home. Go home. You're useless. Just go home. Yeah. Assembly work. Back off! I can't say it much more. Just back off, right? You just go home. You look like a hippie. You're a lazy hippie. - Please. - Assembly. Go on. That's it. You ain't got a job. - Please. Last chance. - There's no last chance. Forget it. Go home. You'll never, ever get a job with me. - No. - Any job for me, please? No, you're too old. Go away. You're wasting your time. You're living in a dream world. Goodbye. Go home. Thank you. Right. Is everyone ready now? Right, all in the back. Come on. Get 'em in. Go on, quick. We haven't got all day. We've got to get to work. Right, OK. That's great. All right, Dad? What are you doing here? - He wanted to see his mum working. - All right, Jamie? I think I've made a mistake, don't you? I didn't want you down here. I wanted you to wait till the office was set up. This is disgraceful, innit? The reason I didn't want you here is I'm setting up my own office. - I want you to see that part of it. - I thought these days was all over. Dad... That's why I didn't want you down here. - I'm gonna take him home. - Don't start. I don't want an argument. - Jamie, bye. - See ya, Mum. Bye, Jamie. Have a good day, yeah? Oh, Rose. There's no fucking talent here. - You're telling me. - I've looked round. There is nothing. - Shocking, innit? - It's shit. Honestly, I'm gonna pull. I need some action. I don't care what it takes. I need to de-stress, that's what I need. You know those guys we put in the van first thing in the morning? They look better than this lot. And that's first thing in the morning. - I've just got an idea. - What? Fucking got a wicked idea. Why don't we get the guys down here tonight? - Who? - Let me think. What about... What's his name? What's his name? What about Petrov and Vlad? Get them down here. - What, to the club? - Yeah, let's get 'em down here. Can do. But he's a bit... I don't know, he's tasty, but... I don't know. He's a bit too serious. All right. What about Alonso? - Nice but... - He's hot! He's got lovely skin. Oh, and really nice teeth. Oi. You're making him sound like a fucking horse. I fancied him. Now... - He only speaks two words of English. - That's all right. Kiss my... - Who are you texting? - Right. Glass of wine. Come round to the flat. - What, to the flat? - Yeah. Tonight. That's what we'll do. Feeling horny... Love, Rose. You... Give... Ow! Give me the... Give me... Stop it. Everyone's... Just give me the thing! - Don't. Give it me. - Oh dear... - Give it me. - It's actually gone. It has gone. It's gone. It's gone, it's gone. (SIow soul music ) - All right, boys? Come in. - Hi. Just go upstairs. All right? Good. Hiya. Rose. You remember Rose, don't you? Milan, Rose. And Marco, yeah? - Right. Go through, then. - Can I have a word? That's not the one I meant. It's the wrong guy. Fuck it. Come on, he'll do. Good morning, Angie. - Hi. I want a word. - Not you. - I need a word now. - These guys are heavy. Leave it. Derek, look. You're making me really fucking nervous, all right? I've got two-dozen workers there. They want their money. You owe two weeks. - They're on my fucking case. - You'll get paid. These guys are getting squared up on Friday. I'll square you up on Monday. - Have I let you down before? - But they're tough and I'm scared. I'm worried about this. I'm telling you. I won't fuck about with these guys. They're mental. Trust me. I told you you should have taken that job in the nursery. Jesus... (Angie ) Get back to work. It's all sorted. We want the money. You'll get it. Back to work or you won't get nothing. It's all sorted. So, Jamie. You're getting older and stronger. You'll be starting secondary school next year. What happens if you lose your temper again? (Man) Are you sorry for what you did, Jamie? Because I don't see any sign of an apology here. (Angie ) Answer the question, Jamie. Give him a few minutes. So does Jamie see his father at all? Well, he retired at 25. He's been sitting on the couch ever since, basically, watching daytime TV. So um... No. The answer's no. The job you're involved in, the people that you find work for... They're employed on a very casual basis rather than regular contracts that most of us would understand. No, not necessarily. They can work seasonal, Christmas... Any particular time we can take them on. We've got labourers, caterers, sandwich makers, factory workers. They can work for a day, a week, a month. You know, it just all depends. You're telling me. Dad, there's work out there and people want it, all right? Times have changed. Things have moved on. But it is all legal and above board? You do have a license? Absolutely. Yeah, it is. My business partner, she sorts out all the legal side and she's very particular, extremely fussy. She knows exactly what she's doing. I'm still interested to find out how you can manage this more-than-full-time job and all the stressful situations that you find yourself in and still provide the support that Jamie will need. Yes, I do, because right now we're in the middle of changing premises. And we're moving on. We're getting new offices. And we're looking to get a personal assistant which means I can pick Jamie up from school when we live together. Would you like to live with your mum, Jamie? - Yeah. - Are you sure? Yeah. Sometimes we don't need to speak, do we, Jamie? Oi! It's been playing on my mind. I am sick of being judged all the time. I'm criticised all the time. All it is is judge, judge, judge. I mean, don't anyone see what I'm doing? I should be praised. I've set up my own business, worked my fucking arse off. Why should I congratulate you? Do you wanna tell me? Give me a clue. Because I'm doing something in this world. Do you know what I mean? All I'm worried about is Jamie. - So am I worried about him. - In about five or six years, when he goes into the world, leaves school, what's he got in store? Competing with Kosovans and Romanians? Living on starvation wages. What chance has he got? - Why don't you join the National Front? - The National Front? Don't you talk to me about them bloody lying bastards. God. At least I'm giving them a chance. Giving them a chance? What about their own countries? Schoolteachers, nurses, doctors. Coming over here, working as waiters on starvation money. What good's that? No one's getting anything out of it apart from bosses and guvnors. - No one else is smiling. - You've got it completely wrong. Consumers are the ones laughing. You'll see that at the supermarket. You think buying a motorbike or a few pairs of trainers every fortnight is gonna look after him? I don't think so. (Angie ) You've just got no idea. (Grandad) Are you paying them the minimum wage? (Angie ) Oh... Look. - These people are starving at home. - Do you pay them the minimum wage? - Tell me. - For God's sake... Next I'm gonna be getting the blame for climate change. What is it gonna be next? You just don't... This is the thing, right? For 30 years, you've been in the same job. Me and you are very different. I've had over 30 jobs, yeah? I've been dumped and screwed in every single job. That's where we're different. No disrespect to you, all right, but I really don't wanna end up poor like you have. I really don't. Cos you know what's gonna happen? I'm gonna completely rot. That's what. So what you're talking about is you and Jamie, just the two of you. The rest of the world can go to hell. Look. It's a big world out there. Have you considered that? Do you actually think anyone gives a shit? Oi! - Can you open up, please? - Sorry. Is closed. - Is closed. Sorry. - Is Derek around? There's no one here. Derek is there. I need to speak to him. It's urgent. Open up. - Sorry, it's... - Just fucking open up! - Now! - OK, OK. I open. One moment. - Come on! - OK, I open. Derek? Fuck... - You fucking scumbag. - Anj... I can't believe what you've fucking done to me. 40 grand. The cheque's bounced twice. It's fucking out of order! I haven't been paid a whole month. I haven't had a penny the whole month. Right, that's it. Come on. We're going to the bank. Now! Listen, there's nae bank. They've fucked off. - Who? - The guys at the top paying everybody. What the fuck are you talking about? I tried to get the money, look what they did. - You fucking deserve it. - Anj, I am completely fucked. - And they're still after me. - Oh, my God, they're gonna... - They're gonna go fucking mad. - I warned you. - I'm in serious shit. - You're in serious shit? Look at me. I warned you about this, I warned you at the very fucking start. And you ignored me. I told ye. It's fucked. Derek? Derek? You've fucking gotta help me out. - I tried to help you at the start. - Fucking don't patronise me! - You wouldnae listen! - Don't patronise me. - Fuck off. - Do something about it. You're a fucking arsehole! That's all you are! Do you understand? First cheque, forty grand. The second cheque here, forty grand. Can you all see that? They have bounced, right? No, hold on. Hear me out. I am very, very honestly sorry. I honestly am. I didn't expect this. Hold on, hold on. We want our money. Fuck... I want to see those. I want to see... See? 40 grand. Right, now, listen. - Listen to me! - I am working for you. I am trying to recover the money for you as soon as possible. I understand you want your money. And so do I. I have been docked. I have been docked. I can't pay because I have no money. I am not a liar. Stop, stop. OK, OK. This is the third time it's happening. Liverpool, Birmingham and now. This is not good. - We have families. - (Angie ) I've got a family as well. You treat us like animals. We work very hard. We are desperate. We need money now. We can't wait any more. I've got a proposition for you. I've got work. Hold on. Right. I've got work. Sshh. Be quiet. Can you tell them? I've got more work for you, guys. I've got more work for you. There you go. - Thanks. - It's OK. - That took courage back there. - Yeah. Can't blame 'em, can you? I mean, they've got families. I'd be the same. They've been completely ripped off. Anyway, what are your plans? - I have two Polish friends. - Mm-hm. Starting business. Very clever. Will soon be rich. They asked me to join them but I want to go home when I save some money. I miss my friends. And my dog. Pickled cucumber. Extreme golf. I knew you'd say that. England is hard place. It's in their eyes when they hear my voice, when they look at us, when they give an order. I'm a man. I'm not a servant. Hold on. I've got something for you, anyway. OK? That's for you. It's for all your help. You've really, really helped me out, all right? All your translating. - Cash? - Yeah. You know the old saying, "Never return a favour, pass it on"? You sound like my dad. You should meet him, actually. There you go. Pass it on. Not everything is money. I was thinking I cook you a typical Polish meal tonight. Will you come to my place, Angel? Karol, I can't. I really... I honestly really wish I met you at another time. OK... (Shouts in Polish) Rose! Rose! (Angie ) I know, Jamie, but I can't. I can't. I can't see you this weekend. I'm sorry. All right? We'll go out the following weekend, yeah? Cos I've fallen off the bike, Jamie. I've swollen up. I can hardly talk. My face is swollen. I had an accident on the bike. Jamie, I'm not lying to you. All right? I've fallen on my nose. Jamie, listen to me, all right? I'll speak to you in private, all right? What do you mean, you've held on all your life? Don't be so cheeky to me! OK? Look, all right, it was a man, yeah? It was a man, Jamie. I didn't lie. I just didn't want to worry you. That's what I didn't wanna do. Jamie... It was just some crazy man, you know, like the people I warn you about. Don't talk to strangers. He was some crazy nutter and he came up to me and just hit me. (Door opens) He's just worried about you. Yeah. - How much is there, then? - Over 25 grand. - What, from the flat? - Yeah, 15 of them. Do you know what? We should have given those blokes some this morning. We've got so much bloody money. I'm just glad Karol's not here to see it all, that's all. Just divide that money, all right? Now. - I'm just saying. - Just do it. Rose, just do it, all right? Divided. You know what? If you wanna pay them, pay them out of your cash. It's a free world. Cos I don't give a shit. OK? Just do what you fucking want. Yeah, I've noticed. (Glass smashes) - Oh, my God! - (Rose screams) - Angie! - Rose! What the fuck's happening? Rose! (Rose ) Angie! Rose, Rose? Are you all right? I think so. I don't know. Something came through the window. Oh, my God... Rose... Rose, have you seen this? - What is it? - Look. Rose, we're in serious shit. Rose, we're in serious shit. Look. Let's phone the police. Just phone the police now. We've got all that money. What are they gonna say? Right. Just turn the lights off. Turn the lights off now. Just do it. Make sure it's really dark. - (Whimpers) - Stay quiet. All right? - All right? - Yeah. - I love it. It's fantastic. - It's great, isn't it? Oh, it's... Oh. I can't believe it. Just think. No more smelly, horrible beer and fags and... Oh, it's great. As soon as we walked in, I was like, this is the one. - It feels like a fresh new start. - Definitely. I love the light. You get loads of light. Look how big it is. Perfect, isn't it? What do you think? On this back wall, we could have a big rainbow sign. Angie & Rose's Recruitment Agency. The Rainbow Way. Whatever you want, Rose. It's great. - It's your call, right? - Fantastic. (Distant police siren) I know it's a bit pricey and everything, but we can afford this, you know. Mm. Sometimes it just seems too good to be true, though. Know what I mean? Story of my life. Not this time, Anj. I really hope not. I've done my homework, Anj. - We've got enough money to do this. - All right. Good. (Mobile bleeps) It's from Ronnie. He wants 45 guys for that new warehouse job by Caledonian. I'm telling you, this is a good start. Tell him we'll get the guys in from the Ukraine, all right? Signing-on fee of L250 per man. That's over 11 grand. Anj, what are you talking about, the Ukraine? That means they're illegal workers. I thought this was a new start for us. Rose, listen. You don't understand. I'm gonna pay off this place before we start. It's the last, last little bit we'll do. - I can't believe you wanna risk... - The last time, all right? Anyway, the warehouse opens on the 14th. Where are we gonna find accommodation for 45 guys? Right. This is it. Looks perfect. It's ten minutes away. - Wait there, all right? I'll be back. - OK. (Angie ) Excuse me. Do you know if there's any spare caravans? Do you speak English? No. All right. - Oh, hi. Hi. - I need a spare caravan. Got any? - No, sorry. - Not anything? No. So what did they say, then? They haven't got none. Ain't got any? So what's the plan now? Dunno. Shit... Oh, come on. Let's just go. Who are you calling? Hi. Is that the immigration service? Hi. Um... I'm... I'm... I'm representing a concerned group of citizens from a local church. - (Mouths) - Now, I'm a bit nervous about this, but I just wanna report something going on. I'm in a campsite right now and it's full of illegal immigrants. I know for a fact they have false papers, OK? It's taken a lot of courage to do this and it's been going on some time now. (Whispers) Put the phone down. Anj, put the phone down. If nothing is done in 24 hours, I'm not being rude but I will go to the press. (Angie ) OK. Mm-hm... Right. It's Morris Glass Factory. It's behind there. It's on Caledonian Street. E15. All right, see you soon. All right, thanks. Bye. What the fuck was that about? What the fuck do you think you're doing, Anj? What do you think? I'm gonna get our workers in. Are you completely fucking mad? They're gonna get out. We're gonna get ours in. There's families down there. I can't believe you've done that. Well, I just have, so believe it. - (Rose ) Do you remember her? - (Angie ) Who? That little girl down there. Who do you think I'm flipping talking about? Do you remember her? It's Mahmoud's kid. - You washed and fed her, hypocrite. - Yeah, I do remember, all right? I'll sort it. Just shut up. Fuck's sake... - Hi, girls. - Hi. Listen to me. Where's your daddy today? - He's in Birmingham. - And your mummy? - She's gone for a cleaning job. - All right. Listen. I want you to get him to get in touch with me. Will you do that? Listen to me very carefully. Can you pack your bags and get out? Straight away. Are you understanding? Can you go now? Go on. Go now, all right? (Angie ) Guys, come on. - They don't understand you. - Did you understand Angie? You need to leave. Immigration are coming. Go out, go out. No, go out. Go out. Go out, go out. (Rose ) Do you know what those people had to do to get here? They're up to their eyes in debt. They've got moneylenders chasing them, Anj. Don't you care? - What if that was Jamie? - It's not Jamie, is it? It's not Jamie, Rose. All right? Just stop the car. Stop the car. I'm ashamed. I feel dirty. I mean, I'm no saint. But what you did back there... It's disgusting. I mean, Christ. We've made a living out of them. We all do. Look at me. I said look at me. Anj, look at me. Is there anything you won't do? I don't know. Probably not, no. I don't know you any more. (Man) Great ball! Allan, Allan, Allan! (Angie ) Go on, Jamie! Go on! (Angie ) Get in there! (Woman) Come on, blues! Take the ball! Take the ball, blues! That's it. Kick the ball! Another thing. I've been getting him to bed... He knows nine o'clock's his time. So keep a bit of discipline on that. Make sure he's in bed around nine o'clock. All right, Dad. It's only four days anyway. - I know, but... - Do you know what I mean? - He's been good. Let's keep it like that. - It's four days. Calm down. Go on, Jamie! (Man) Get in there! Well done. That's his hat-trick. I'll have a Hawaiian pizza. And that's a nine-inch. Right? And a cheese and tomato pizza. And that's a 12-inch, please. And I need it after seven cos we won't be in. - Yes, we will. - Sshh. - Mum, do you want olives? - All right. Yeah, can I have olives on the nine-inch Hawaiian, please? Tosser! Die! (Gunfire and screaming) (Doorbell rings) - That's the pizza. - Shit. What's the time? - 20 to seven. - I told him not to come before seven. - Quickly. Go on. - No, you go. - Go on. I wanna see this. - So do I. I wanna see the end. Go on, hurry up, cos I'm not stopping it. (Doorbell rings) Fire in the hole! Jamie? Jamie, hurry up. You're missing the film. Jamie? Hurry up. Jamie? Has a little boy been in here with a blue shirt on? Have you seen... Have you seen a little boy at all? Blue shirt? Have you seen a little boy with a blue shirt on? - A little boy? - Yeah, he's got a blue shirt on. - Brown hair. - No. Hello? Hi. Have any pizzas been delivered to 987 Leytonstone High Road at all? Ten minutes ago? Is the delivery boy there at all? Can you get him to call me as soon as he gets back? Do you know when? Can you get him to call me? You've got my number, haven't you? All right, then. OK. Thanks. (Footsteps) Jamie? Jamie? Jamie, are you... (Screams) Help! No! No! Help! Help! - Help! - Sshh... Sshh... (Speaks Ukrainian) Not a good feeling, is it? Let me tell you a story about you people. I have a friend who has a son. 18 years old. He got a job at a food farm. From your people. People like you. He was sent to work with a rope-reeling machine. You know, the one that spins. The very first day, he caught his jacket. My friend got his son back in two pieces. Cut in half. Another son fell from a truck, broke his spine. Can't move a finger. (Urine trickles) Do you think your son is more important than ours? Liar. It doesn't matter. They die, lose an arm, get buried alive in the trenches, work for nothing. Be robbed from people like you. Plenty more to choose from. As long as you have enough to buy a new 4x4, who cares? (Man speaks Ukrainian) You owe 20 men L2,000 each. We want our money. Nothing more, nothing less. We'll take this. You still owe us L30,000. If you move from this room or make one call before we tell you, you'll never see Jamie again. OK? Be a good girl. Sshh... (Doorbell rings) (Doorbell) - Mum... - Jamie! - The police stopped me, Mum. - Oh, Jamie... Get off. The pizzas'll get all squashed. - I was worried about you. - I know. I was stopped by the police, like a special enquiry thing. They showed me their badges and everything. They said not to worry. - They'll ring you. Not to worry. - Thank God. They wanted to know my school, Grandad's full name. - Oh, God... - Um... Best mate's name. Everything. It was like a special enquiry thing. (Jamie ) Dunno. Why, what's the matter? - It was like a special enquiry thing. - Yeah? They'll ring you to tell you not to worry and that. (Phone rings) Hello? Yes, he is. He's fine. Listen to me, all right? You'll get every single penny back. You stay away from my son. Hello. Angie. All right? - Very pleased to meet you. - Hi. Right. I'll just clarify things with you before we start. Firstly, they need visas for the UK, OK? The older ones will get tourist visas. The younger ones get student visas. If they question about the language school, I've got information in there. The main thing here that I'm really concerned about is they need to keep their mouths shut and their head down. - Not a word, all right? - Sure. If they don't, I've got nothing to do with them whatsoever. They'll be deported. Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes. - All right. Thanks. (Speaks Ukrainian) (Angie ) If you can just ask about documentation, passport and medical. - Thank you. - Their previous work. (Speaks Ukrainian) She was working at a barber shop. (Speaks Ukrainian) - What's she talking about? - She's leaving her two children here. So she hopes that Rainbow will bring her luck. I'm sure it will. All right. - What's your name? - My name is Ludmilla. Ludmilla. (Speaks Ukrainian)
