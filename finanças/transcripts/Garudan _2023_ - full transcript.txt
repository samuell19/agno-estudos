Turn down the volume, man. What is this? Why are you still sober? Have a drink, Salamikka! Let me pour water. Pour some water. Come on! This is Salam Kyperi. If he has one drink, next one will be free. Phew. Shiva, I'm not sure if I turned off the main switch at the site. This lightning suddenly reminded me. You turned it off, Ikka. And even if you didn't, what's going to happen? There's nothing to be struck by lightning there, right? It's an under-construction building, right? But I need to go check. Otherwise it will keep bothering me. There he goes again! You should be called 'Unsure' Salam instead of 'Supervisor' Salam. You are always unsure. No, dude. The finals are happening tomorrow. Dude, everyone is practising vigorously over here. Yes! We will win this year's zonal trophy for sure! We'll see! We'll see! - He's challenging me! - Are you going in the rain? Teresa! Are you leaving? Let's do one more rehearsal. Please! No way, dear. My dad is alone at home. You know, right? Let her leave. Or else, she'll be court-martialled. Hey Noorah! I have to go back home and cook for Dad. But how will you understand all that? You're shamelessly hogging food made by your mom, four times a day, right? Shall I leave? The rain, the cold weather and that girl. There was a song about it, right Saji? That song with the girl... "Mainakam"... Shut up! Give it to me. - Isn't that the one? - Him and his "Mainakam". Hey! What was the name of that yellow Sari chick from Ravipuram? It's raining heavily. Shall I call her? Stop it, Shiva. Don't tempt us as well. Come on, drink! Bro, avoid the gutters while driving. Pass me the water. It's so dark here! Look, Supervisor! The main switch is off! You and your imaginations! - I'm leaving. - Wait! - I'm coming too. - Got drenched for no reason. [crying in pain] Who's that? Stop! Shiva, come fast! Ikka! Catch him! Hey! Stop! - Help me! Catch him! - Salam Ikka! - Hey! - Ikka! Hold her. [Singing an old Malayalam song] Oh God! Will it be the Principal? Sir! Was it you, Xavier? We would have died in shock now. Sir, there's an emergency. Teresa, from D1 English class... We're in front of Stephen Luke Hospital now. A girl was admitted here under suspicious circumstances some time back. We came rushing here on hearing the news. They're not allowing us inside. She had left saying that her dad is alone at home. How is she, Sister? We've gathered that a girl has been admitted here, under suspicious circumstances. We've been informed that DCP Harish Madhav is on his way. From whatever information we could gather, we suppose that the girl has been seriously injured. Yeah! I'm here, sir. I'll brief you soon. 15 minutes... max. - Okay. - Sir. This way, sir. Yeah? - He went inside, sir. - Around 8:30 p.m... - I saw it while heading back. - What's the status? She is unconscious now. It's a rape. There are signs of strangulation, possibly caused by a metal chain-like object. We can't say anything now. She's under observation. And... coma is a possibility. Move. What happened to my daughter? It's nothing, sir. My daughter... She's alright. - Where is my daughter? - She is in the ICU. ICU? What are you saying? She's in ICU? - She's under observation, sir. - Please don't be stressed. She'll be alright. - Sir, please come. - Sit down, sir. Sir... Sir, that's Teresa's father. Somebody tell me something! It's all fine, sir. Please sit down. I want to see Teresa. I... - I want to see her. Please! - Doctor will come now, sir. Let me see my daughter! Please show her to me! Somebody please help me! We went back and checked, based on a doubt, sir. Otherwise, we would have known only when the watchman showed up. That too, only if he checked inside. I saw him, sir. In the flash of the lightning. I have not seen him before. If you see him again, will you recognize him, Salam? Definitely, sir. Though I was three drinks down, I wasn't drunk. When I saw this, my high dissipated in an instant. Anyway, don't say any of this to the media. You know, right? If they get something, they won't leave you. Breaking News! College student assaulted at Kochi. Kochi City Police Commissioner has informed us that the investigation has begun. The girl who was assaulted is in critical condition. More information regarding the incident... Watchman? Sir, it's exactly like Salam described. The workers leave around 7 p.m. in the evening. The watchman reaches around 9 p.m. and stays till 8 a.m. in the morning. It's definitely not a random act. It's a planned attack, with carefully adjusted timings. Yes, sir. Is it him? - No. - Are you sure? It's not him, sir. This one? Look carefully. - Are you sure? - No. It's not him, sir. Harish, semen was found in the girl's body. No fingerprints were found on the dog-chain. Moreover, it's quite old too. So, it would be difficult to trace. It's rusted? Sir, what happened was a very well-planned attack. The culprit was aware that nobody would be present at that site, post 7 p.m. The final rehearsals for the inter-zone youth festival... were happening for the past four days, at that campus. Teresa was assaulted on the fourth day. So, someone who knew Teresa closely; someone who knew her routine and timings for those four days... Someone who knew all this precisely. We've already interrogated around 100 people who are connected to Teresa, including her batch-mates, students of that campus and teachers. We could not zero in on anything. Now, it's time for the reality. Teresa... Now, she's in coma. She's alive only because of the life-support system. We don't know how long it will stay that way. We are really sorry. Officer! She has been in the ICU for 7 days. And now, in a coma! When are you... and how are you going to catch the bloody culprit? Tell me! Tell me! ♪ Mind ablaze ♪ ♪ The day's beyond reach ♪ ♪ Lonely road ahead ♪ ♪ As gratitude does teach ♪ ♪ Is the truth being covered? ♪ We want justice! It's alleged that the police investigation into the student rape case... is stagnating and making no headway. Alleging that the police are searching in the dark with no leads, the Opposition Party made a walk-out from the Legislative Assembly. We've been informed that the case will be handed over to the Crime Branch soon. Sir! What next? We're going for a long-shot attempt. Ancestral genetics. DNA ancestry. To determine whether our ancestors are Africans, Aryans or Jews, people donate their DNA's, just out of curiosity. Hundreds of agencies that accept these DNA samples, preserve them in their repository. We'll send our rapist's semen sample to such agencies. What if any one sample from their database, matches with our sample? What if that becomes the "God's evidence" in our case? Yes! Sir, we found a match! Sudev V. Rajan. An IT professional, from Hyderabad. [radio announcement in Hyderabad] Sudev V. Rajan? Yes? Sudev, you're not a criminal, and I'm not an officer who has come to take you into custody. I'm assuring that once again. You can tell me anything... that I will need to know. Please! Sir, I was born and brought up in Hyderabad. I go to Kerala very rarely. I don't know anyone there. And I did this DNA sampling, out of curiosity. But... not only me. My friends also did the same. So, if I could know why you've brought me here... I can be more specific. Do you know her? No, sir. Sure? Excuse me, sir. Can I have a word? Sir, he was at his office on the night of the incident. There is proof. Late night, with friends, he had gone to the bar... and swiped the credit card. There's proof for that too. He has gone to his office on the next day as well. There's proof for that too. Okay. Okay. You told me that you don't know anyone back in Kerala. Will that also mean that you don't have any relatives in Kerala? I mean, blood relatives? There's a family in Kochi. My grandpa's younger brother's family. But I'm not in contact with them. And an elder cousin from that family is my FB friend, I suppose. If you want, I can find the details. Just to show. Nothing else. I don't think that it's him, sir. Wait. What? - Can't you walk properly? - What are you saying? - You bumped into me, right? - Can't you see even with the specs on? It's him, sir. It's definitely him! - Sir, shall we catch him right away? - No. We must close all possible loopholes. Look what Mommy has brought for you, baby! Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! Madam, shall I leave? Okay. Aeroplane! Aeroplane! Sir! - It belongs to Nishanth, right? - Yes, sir. I took all this from their bathroom. You may go. Sir, on the night of the incident, while the students were practising, the Principal had asked us to be present there. All of us decided to hang out and chill for sometime. Sir, we were drinking. That's when Xavier came in and told us about Teresa. Varghese sir promised that he'll bring two bottles. But when he came back, he had only one bottle with him. He said that he misplaced one bottle on the way. Someone said that one bottle won't be enough. Nishanth sir asked us to start drinking, and that he will bring a bottle. Nishanth sir doesn't drink. He went out and came back after half an hour, with a bottle. We came to know about Teresa, half an hour after he came back. I think Nishanth sir went out and returned with the bottle, before that. That's all I know. It's time to pick him. Go ahead! Sir! Hey, Nishanth sir! - All good? - Yes. We need to go to the station, sir. What's the matter? I'll tell you. Come. Sir, I've come shopping with my family. Your family will come, sir. You please walk. - Let me talk... - Walk, sir. Sir, we came shopping! Move! Hey! Get him in! Come on, get in. Haritha! He has been here for 5-6 hours now, right? It's time! Sorry to keep you waiting, Nishanth. Please sit down. I had some last-minute cross-checking to do. Sir, what is this? Why have you held me here? Don't you know it, Nishanth? Then why are you asking me again? You're talking based on some misconception. Since you've decided to put up a performance, let's start with the first reason. You've been taken into custody... for brutally raping Teresa Philip and leaving her on the brink of death. What do you mean, sir? Yes, Nishanth! I can prove that beyond doubt. Sir, please don't fabricate things. I have a family! I have a young daughter. Teresa is also someone else's daughter. You shouldn't have forgotten that. You are officially under arrest. Sir? It was drizzling that night. We were all in our room, after finishing our work. And I remembered something suddenly. Salam! Salam! You needn't say it like you've learned it by-heart. Since you're saying the truth, you can express it in your own style. The Judge is not sitting there to evaluate an elocution competition, right? What do you say, Harish? Tell me, like how you'd say it naturally. The rain made us wonder if we had turned off the main switch. To clear that doubt, we went back to the work site. And I saw him running away, in the dim light. It was him. I am sure. Your Honour! He has mistaken me for someone else. Or else, he is lying! Defence, please control your client. Sorry, Your Honour. Sir, please. Someone else is behind this, sir. Please believe me. Sir! The evidence against you is so compelling that even I find it hard to believe that you're not the culprit. What can I do? It's all fabricated, sir. Everything is fabricated. Are you the one who conducted the DNA tests? - Yes, sir. - Can you please give us more details? His DNA and the DNA of the semen found in the victim's body... are the same. We've submitted all the reports to the police. During the time of the incident, was the culprit with you throughout? He wasn't with us all the time, sir. Nishanth sir left and returned during the period when the incident is said to have happened. Sir... The Ernakulam Sessions Court will declare the verdict on the student rape case today. The court's decision will rely on the examination of the evidence presented by the prosecution, as well as other scientific evidence against the accused, Nishanth. Hang Teresa's rapist!! No pardon for Teresa's rapist! It has been proven beyond doubt that the accused has committed this heinous crime. Considering the gravity of his offence, he has been sentenced to life imprisonment. Nishanth, the accused in the student rape case... has been declared guilty by the Ernakulam Sessions Court. Nishanth, the culprit, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the court.

When the vehicle was seized, you received a call from the Minister's office, right? Just deny it. You have a family, right? You have a wife and son, don't you? Let it slide, sir. I'll set you straight soon, sir! Are they the Dollar Minister's people? - Yes. - Ah! Minister Mathew had to resign. Well, he has high hopes of regaining his Ministerial position. And this is the strategy he has chosen! Well, well! [The culprit of the student rape case, Nishanth, is getting released from prison] Professor, it's your lucky day! You're being released today, right? His condition is really bad, sir. Many a time, he doesn't even recognize us. And sometimes, he becomes really violent too. This is what Alzheimer's disease is like. Colonel is being treated by Neurologist Dr. Ajith Kumar, right? Yes, sir. I'll be meeting Dr. Ajith anyway. - I'll ask him to adjust the dosage. - Okay, sir. - Okay. - Okay. Sir, is there any improvement in Teresa's condition? It's been almost seven years now. If a coma exceeds even six months, it can harm the organs and muscles. Removing the ventilator support would result in Teresa's demise. Don't you know it? Aren't you in the medical field? Look at him playing around! His 12th grade results will be out in two hours. And he's not bothered about it at all. These days, all students are achieving distinctions. My dear Sree... this boy wants to go to Europe, study catering and become a cook. Why does he have to achieve such high scores? Don't become one of those competitive mommies! It's not that, Hari. What if he fails? Well, among the 99.9% students who pass the exam, there's a 0.1% chance of failure for a pest, right? What if that's our son? Sir, their community service programme is happening day after tomorrow. And as you said, the criminal psychology seminar has been charted for three days. Good. Sir, do you feel disheartened by the punishment transfer to KAP right before your retirement? We're gonna miss you, sir. You're retiring and leaving from here, right? Where will I go? I can come back here often... as visiting faculty. And... keep one thing in mind. Once a policeman, always a policeman! I need to go and see my daughter first. She must be all grown up now. She might not even recognize me. Bye, sir. Hey! Can't you refill these empty jars? Should I do everything over here? - Saji... - Do it, man! Nishanth? Hello! When were you released? In the morning. Hey! Didn't you recognize him? - Come! - Mom, we didn't take the ATM card. - Mom! - Just come, I say! Please don't mind it. - You know, right? - It's alright. Do you need some money? No. I didn't come here for that. I need to see Haritha and my daughter. You know where they are, right? Seven years have passed since I last saw my daughter. - We'll see if there's a problem. - I think he's here to talk. We'll see! Can I go to Malu's house to play, Mom? You can play after finishing your homework. Okay, Chechi. Come. Hey! He has been waiting here for the past couple of hours. We thought we'll wait until you come. I don't know him. I don't want to see him either. Haritha! Let me... Hey! Stop hanging around and get out of here. How dare he! Anyway, this pest didn't fail. He managed to score 70% somehow. I'm happy he scored at least that much. Don't say that. He passed the exam, right? Yes, yes! Smart fellow! He will leave the country soon. And you'll be retiring next week. What's your future plan? Using my retirement funds, I need to send him abroad, without taking any loans. I need to sell this house. I've readied a property in my home-town. I will build a small house there, and live a simple, peaceful life there along with my wife. I just want to relax and do nothing for a long time. You'll be bored to death! - Will we? - No way! I'm fed up, Iype! I've had enough of running around. Who is it? That Dollar Minister's trial is happening tomorrow. These are threats, asking me to change my testimony. Brave guys who're making internet calls sitting abroad! Such shady guys! Since they can't threaten you in person, they opt for guerrilla warfare via phones. This is your first night in the prison, right? Hey! Don't be disrespectful, Vareethetta. He's a big shot Professor! How the hell does it matter! When people like him land up here, it's a celebration. What are you looking at, huh? Hey, hey! That's enough! You can continue... tomorrow! Go! The ward member from Haritha's area had called. She said you'll be bashed up and handed over to the police. Moreover, she said she'd file a case too. Forget her, Nishanth! Try to go somewhere else and start your life afresh. That's better for you. Who kept this here? Somebody had come here, claiming to be a relative of yours. He just left. Oh. Today, DCP Harish will appear in Ernakulam Additional Sessions Court to testify in the Dollar smuggling case, with ex-Minister Mathew as the accused. Ex-Minister Mathew is facing charges related to smuggling Dollars along with imported books. The Minister has arrived at the court now. This case has created quite a furore in Kerala Politics. Sir! Sir! Sir! Please say something, sir. Do you think you can prove your innocence, sir? - Write this name as well. - This one, sir? You still have time to tone down your testimony, Harish sir. As you know, this is politics! If things turn around, what if Mathew sir becomes a Minister again? You know what will happen then, right? Hello? DCP Harish? This is Minister Mathew Joseph's PA calling from his office. I'll pass the phone to him. Hey, policeman! Let that vehicle go. I'm affiliated to that charitable society. It would be difficult, sir. In between those second-hand books, there are Dollars worth Crores of Rupees. Harish! Just obey me! I'm a Minister and you're just a DCP! If you don't obey me, you'll have to face the consequences. The court should ensure the authenticity of this call recording immediately. One of the board members of this charitable organization is Minister Mathew Joseph's wife. You refused to succumb to his threats. You registered a case. Following which, the Minister had to resign. Right? Yes. [reporters asking multiple questions] Tell me, sir. How dare he, Harish! How dare he! How dare he come and see my daughter! How dare this country do this to me? I am a freakin' soldier! That ******* is walking alive and free! And my daughter is... ... is still in a coma, Harish! What wrong have I done, Harish! What wrong have I done? Sir, it would cost 40 Lakhs to do this course in Swiss. 3 year-diploma in culinary science. He can get a stay-back of two years. And within one month, we'll arrange everything including the offer letter. Then, you can arrange the funds, sir. Okay. Will there be any guarantee regarding the placements? Oh, sure! Since we're spending so much money on his education... Well, sir... Sir, assistance will be available for placements. And getting a job... will depend upon his performance during the training period. And if you're interested in getting an education loan, we can support you. I don't need a loan. I have no plans to take loans. Frankly, I should be giving him the burden of that loan. Huh? But he's my only child, right? I had set aside all my retirement benefits long back itself, for this purpose. So, let it happen that way. - Did you close the file? - I will. What? Get into the car. I'll just be back. - Come. - Where's dad going? You've started showing gimmicks as soon as you got released, huh? No! I just felt like seeing that girl. Was it out of guilt... or to determine if she still had enough life left for you to end it? Nishanth! I'm someone who had the urge to kill people like you many times, but refrained from it, just because I don the police uniform. But in your case, I will do it, if the need arises. That daughter and father deserve it. Nothing like that, sir. A good job! That's what I am after. Go! Sir... You're retiring in two days, right sir? I'm not extending my speech. My best wishes for Harish Madhavan's long life, good health, and happiness. Along with that, I invite Mr. Harish to deliver his speech, with heartfelt affection. Harish, please. My dear colleagues, I'm filled with happiness and a strong sense of pride as I retire. Party, attention! Throughout my life, I have always stood for justice. Party, salute! Our foundation should exist based on the affection and the trust of the people, and not upon their fear. Because it's the people who provide us our daily bread. The people alone! The wisdom I've gained and shared... Even if a single individual who completes their training here can embody them... That will be the legacy I leave behind. I had given the receipt earlier. After checking that... - Yes, George. - Iype sir... - Remember Nishanth, of the Teresa case? - Yes. I just saw him entering the High Court now. I sense something fishy. Okay, George. Yes, Iype. Where are you? I am at the function here. I need to meet you urgently. Nishanth has filed a petition at the High Court to reopen the case. Even after serving the punishment? - Is it possible? - Yes, it is possible. As per section 386 of CrPC, and reading along with section 482 of the same, it's very much possible. But why? It's an open and shut case. Why should he rake it up again? That too, after so long? There could be various reasons. In the last seven years, he went from being a respected figure to a nobody, right? Or it could be a publicity stunt. Or else, it could be part of an attempt to reduce his peer and personal damage. Whatever the reason may be, if the court reopens this case, I'll roast him at court. Why is that Nishanth applying to reopen the case? Who cares! My official association with Kerala Police has come to an end today. Let's think about our future life, dear. Yes. But it's the timing he picked to reopen the case that worries me. Exactly on the day you are retiring, Hari. Professor Nishanth who was the culprit in the infamous Teresa case has approached the High Court demanding a retrial. Never before has someone applied for a retrial at the High Court after serving their sentence without first going through the appeals process. This move by Nishanth has stirred up curiosity among the police. Legal experts opined that this case will be rejected in its initial stage itself. Furthermore, legal experts are emphasizing that this incident is of the utmost rarity within the Indian legal landscape. We need to wait and see what the High Court will decide, regarding this case. The retrial petition submitted by the defendant Nishanth is comprehensive, and has compelled this court to reconsider. A new twist in the Teresa case! The High Court has ruled in favour of the culprit Nishanth's retrial petition. The High Court realized that this case needs a retrial, after thorough examination... Hey! Bring all the files of the Teresa case. I need to re-examine them. Iype, I'll repeat it once more. I will leave within two weeks. After that, I'll come back to this city, only if it's absolutely necessary. This case is yours now. You do what you want! Hey! Listen to me! Yeah, okay. You... Hello? - Understood? - Haritha! Come. Don't turn back. Look straight and walk! You'll see many such people! [The number you're calling is out of coverage area] There's a problem, Harish. The main witness of the case, Salam, cannot be found. His phone is switched off. Upon speaking with his wife, she responded passively, mentioning that he's away for work in Coimbatore. I sent people to their house to inquire. She repeated the same then as well. I don't think they are in good terms. What's the problem? I'm worried that Nishanth might have jeopardized Salam. Or else, he would've threatened Salam and shifted him somewhere else. He can play so many games! Iype! Don't forget that he has come here, from the prison. To kidnap or threaten someone, he needs both financial and physical support. He won't dig up this case without some kind of motive, right? Harish, please! You ought to step in. I seriously think something is off. Really off! He has gone to Coimbatore, sir. It's been 8-10 days since he left. I had told this to the cops. Doesn't he call you? He calls occasionally. He doesn't use his phone much nowadays. You have his number, right? Why don't you try calling him? What's your name, dear? - Sameera. - Huh? Sameera. Which grade are you studying in? 12th grade. Razia, if your husband doesn't appear in court, that could turn into a lifeline for Nishanth. We should not be the reason for the exoneration of a criminal like him. Whichever end of the world he might be at, Salam must reach, when the case is called. Or else, God will never forgive him or you. At the time Teresa fell into a coma because of Nishanth, she was approximately the same age as Sameera. This is an unprecedented occurrence in Indian judicial history, unfolding at the Ernakulam Sessions Court. The Teresa case, recently marked for retrial, is back in the headlines. Furthermore, the most exceptional aspect of this case is that the culprit, Nishanth himself has initiated the retrial. SC No. 114/2015 Your Honour, Thomas Iype. I'm representing the State. The Prosecution rests with this case... and the judgement was in our favour. This case was concluded seven years ago and the sentence had been handed down. Back then, he didn't go for an appeal against it. Without doing any of that, if he shows up one morning and insists on reopening the case... It's absolutely ridiculous. And he's trying to waste the time of the Honourable Court. So, I humbly request the court to dismiss this retrial petition at the earliest. That's all, Your Honour. Is your advocate present? While serving my sentence, I earned a law degree from the Central University during 2016-19. I humbly seek permission to represent myself in this case. Even if you don't have a degree in law, as per Section 32 of the Advocates' Act 1961, any ordinary citizen can plead his own case. I know, Your Honour. But there's a difference between an average person pleading their case and a person who has studied law doing so. So, may I? - Yes. - Thank you, Your Honour. I allege that... the police conducted an inadequate investigation and hastily framed charges on an easily found individual, in my case. To prove this, Your Honour... as per CrPC, I request permission from the court to cross-examine PW1, Salam. Objection, Your Honour. Maybe because... the defence counsel is not familiar with legal proceedings, Your Honour. It's the prosecution that has to start the witness examination first. Without understanding this, the accused cannot jump in and begin cross-examination. While starting the proceedings, Prosecution had stated that... Prosecution rests with the case. That means that he doesn't have anything more to ask the witness, and that he has nothing more to contribute to the case. So, I don't understand what this objection is for, Your Honour. Objection overruled. Thank you, Your Honour. PW 1, Salam. PW 1, Salam! You haven't been in town for a while now, Salam. Where were you? I was at a relative's house in Coimbatore. I went there for a business purpose. Coimbatore or Gudalur? Salam has come here, from a de-addiction centre in Gudalur. Weren't you admitted there for the past one month? Yes. Is it the first time that you're getting admitted in a de-addiction centre, to treat alcohol addiction? Your Honour, during the past seven years, Salam has been admitted in different de-addiction centres, six times. These are the records. After verification, you can take this into file. We had boozed lightly that night, sir. Regardless of whether it's one drink or four, 'boozed lightly' is a commonly used expression. - Isn't that right, Shiva? - Yes. Did Salam, the witness, consume alcohol that night? Yes, sir. He did. I remember that he had mentioned it to the policemen who were present there. It's evident from this that the police opted for a primary witness who is a chronic alcoholic. He had consumed alcohol even on the night of the incident. Apart from all this, that place had no electricity that night. And witness Salam states that... he caught just a fleeting glimpse of my face, in the flash of a lightning. Our country enforces severe fines and penalties even for drunken driving, as alcohol can impair a person's judgement. Though they could have discredited that witness then, the police chose not to. I humbly request the court to discredit him, at least now. This will be verified and appropriate orders shall be issued later. Thank you, Your Honour. Even while I was a junior, I haven't been humiliated like this in court. I couldn't bear the shame. Why are you silent? Normally, when an inmate studies and earns a law degree while in prison, it often becomes major news. But Nishanth kept it under wraps. Or he gave a special request to keep it hidden. What for? Because... he must have been planning this for a while then. Right? When he reopened this case, I never imagined Salam's situation would turn out like this. I... There's something I haven't told you so far. That will be a bigger problem than Salam. SC No. 114/2015 The next major evidence against me... is this test result, from Central Laboratory, which comes under Kerala Government. Mr. Lab Director, I have a question for you. Where is this lab now? Tell me! The lab is... It has been temporarily shut down for the past couple of years. Reason? I shall explain the reason, Your Honour. Permit me to examine a couple more witnesses. Objection, Your Honour. Do not allow him to examine new witnesses until the witness list is given to the Prosecution. Hand over the additional witness list to the Prosecution. You can continue the trial after that. Yes, Your Honour. I have another humble request. Yes, go ahead. No matter what the verdict of my case's retrial is, I've already completed my punishment and been released. Because of this case, I lost my job. I lost my family. I lost my reputation. My life is stuck in a limbo now. So, considering my current situation, I humbly request the court to temporarily suspend my conviction, to practice as an Advocate and earn my livelihood, until the retrial of this case is completed. Vijay... You need to pay the fees in three weeks. Or else, you won't gain admission for this term. Smitha Jijo, Samuel John. And PV Murugan, also known as Burglar Murugan, from Kannur Central Jail. These three people are the new witnesses. Who are these people? Among them, we spoke to Samuel and Smitha. It's quite complicated. But Murugan is a bigger problem. He isn't allowing us to meet him or talk to him. He denied our visitation request too. Why? He suspects that we will jeopardize him, apparently. DW1 Smitha Jijo... Your Honour, Smitha is here as a witness in connection with the shutdown of Central Chemical Laboratory, owned by Kerala Government. Tell me, Smitha. What's your connection to the lab? I had filed a case regarding the paternity of my daughter, some time back. The first test result of the paternity test... that I got from this lab, was wrong. As I had a doubt regarding the result, I appealed to a higher court. As per the court's order, re-tests were conducted simultaneously at two different labs in Hyderabad and Delhi, and I won the case. Yes. I've submitted those copies to the court, Your Honour. Prosecution, you don't intend to cross-examine her, right? No, Your Honour. DW2 John Samuel. I had sold a property to a person called Somaraj long back. He filed a case against me alleging that a very old document for that property had been forged. I was sure that I hadn't done anything illegal. This lab was tasked with confirming the document's authenticity and age. The result from that lab was unfavourable for me. I became a crook! Will I leave it at that? I initiated an appeal. I had it tested at three or four reputed labs. The results from those labs were in my favour. I won the case too. The tension I had to go through because of this lab... It was quite extreme, Your Honour. I've submitted the copies of the test results and the verdict of this case, which happened six months after the verdict was declared for my case. Two years ago, after these two cases surfaced, the Alathur court had issued an order... in the Jinesh Devasya v/s State of Kerala AAR 212 case, declaring that the results from this lab were unacceptable. Consequently, the Government gradually shut down this lab in the name of renovation. Forever! I've submitted copies of the verdict of the Alathur case, to the court. DW3, Murugan. DW3, Murugan. Murugan, you're widely known as "Burglar" Murugan, right? Yes, sir. You're serving life imprisonment at Kannur Central Jail, right? Yes, sir. Can you explain to the court why you have come here? Sir, prior to this, I was imprisoned... for strangling a housewife to death during a burglary attempt at Malappuram. Before that, this girl called Teresa... was assaulted in Kochi... And I was the one who did it. [crowd murmurs] Silence! I didn't do it deliberately, sir. When I saw her walking alone, it somehow happened during that circumstance. When people gathered, I fled from this city. And I resurfaced at Malappuram, only after seeing the news... that this Professor was arrested. And I got caught during my very next crime. It was me who assaulted that girl, sir. And nobody else. Objection, Your Honour. It's a mere drama. Why I should confess to this crime too, with just two months left of my sentence? I'm old now. I'm completely worn out. To be frank, I am on a spiritual path now. I need to atone for my sins, as far as I can. Do you want to ask him anything, Iype? Yes, Your Honour. Murugan, Sir... How long had you known Teresa for? What a question, sir! Didn't I say that it wasn't deliberate? That means that I didn't know her earlier, sir. What will you get if you admit to this murder charge, Murugan? Has anyone made any offer to you? I've received an offer, sir. God has offered me some peace of mind. And if I can atone for the tears of this Professor and his family, I can die peacefully, sir. Isn't that the greatest offer? The responsibility of checking the validity of Murugan's statements lies with the police. They should also provide the court with updates on the investigation's progress. Defence counsel, you may proceed. Your Honour, though the police investigated the Teresa case around six to seven months... and couldn't find any evidence, this case was solved dramatically, just a week before the Crime Branch was about to take over this case. A witness who's an addict, a notorious lab infamous for sending out wrong test results, The police investigation team, which refused to conduct a second test for that lab's result. Though a criminal like Murugan had committed a similar murder in the neighbouring district, the police officer who refused to even notice that fact. All these people destroyed MY life. Seven years of mine! My family, my career! This case is as clear as the daylight sky now. I deserve compensation. Though nothing can replace what I've lost. As per section 357 A of CrPC, which says about the compensation to victims, and also with reference to Rithul Shah v/s State of Bihar, and in the case of GS Ahluwalia and Rajiv Kumar Shrivastava CRA No. 463 of 2008. If the victim is to receive compensation for the State's wrongful police investigation, the funds must be retrieved from the officer who handled the case. I humbly request the Honourable Court... to retrieve the compensation I rightfully deserve... from this investigating officer, and render a fair verdict, akin to those in the cases I cited before. It has to be so because... it's not an error in judgement from his side. Your Honour, it was an act of malicious intent. Unlawful acts committed by a police officer, to prevent losing the case to someone else. What did he get for that? A police medal from the Chief Minister. And me? I decided to don this lawyer's suit... for the numerous people who had been trapped, just like me. Justice... Everyone deserves it, Your Honour. In light of the confession made by DW3 Murugan in this case, it has been proved beyond doubt that the accused, Nishanth, is not guilty, this court hereby dismisses all charges against him and declares him not guilty. Thank you, Your Honour. In recognition of the fact that the accused was wrongfully charged, leading to defamation, job loss, and mental suffering, the court grants him Rs. 48 Lakhs. Additionally, for the time unjustly spent in jail, the accused will receive Rs. 22 Lakhs, bringing the total compensation to Rs. 70 Lakhs. The court mandates that this compensation be disbursed to the accused. The court directs that the aforementioned sum should be recovered from the investigating officer. I had told you when you arrested me, that you're making a mistake. You didn't listen to me. I want to live, sir. Respectably, with my head held high. The label of a criminal doesn't suit an innocent man like me. That night I had told you... that I'm after a job. That job was to win against you. ♪ Tear my Soul, you hoped ♪ ♪ Watched me bleed ♪ This court verdict has caused great humiliation to the police force. We're in front of Harish Madhavan's residence now. This is a dark chapter in the history of Kerala Police investigations. Ernakulam Sessions Court has delivered a unique verdict in this case. Harish Madhavan hasn't responded to the verdict yet. All the media-persons are waiting outside his house. Dude, I think it's a crazy situation out here. Forget paying the fees. We can't even step out of the house now. Yeah, dude. It's really crazy around here. I'll call you later. Sir, what do you have to say about the court's verdict? I honour the court's decision. I'm still studying the details. I'll be giving a detailed response later to all of you. This is all I have to say, as of now. Okay. Thank you. What can we understand from today's court verdict? Harish Madhavan is a police officer, willing to resort to any form of deception in order to manipulate the outcome of a case to his liking. Professor Nishanth is a great warrior. That's why he kept fighting until he won the case. The same will happen in my case too. That's all I have to say for now. We'll discuss about the rest later. No, no! I've said everything I wanted to say. Later! Aneesh! God is actually on our side. Or else, we won't get such a golden opportunity at this point. We need to flare it up! The party workers are all furious, right? Idiots! Move! Move! Please move! What are you doing? Please move aside! Move! Move! Move! Move! Hey! Please move! The court has pronounced a highly unusual verdict. We fully acknowledge the court's decision. So, the department will be releasing the retirement benefits of the investigating officer, Harish, only after the entire amount declared by the court is paid. That's all for now. Don't worry, Dad. People will forget all this very soon. Even if I can't go to college this year, it's alright. And... even if I'm unable to study abroad, it's okay for me, Dad. I'll study in some college here. Dad! Please! Don't be sad! Dad... Is he... actually innocent? Sir, how do you see this new life of yours? I harbour no complaints against anyone. I'm just happy that justice has won in the end. And... I need to reclaim the life that I had lost. Dear... I will continue my fight for the people who are denied justice. That's another reason why I studied law. So, you've decided not to return to your old Professor's job? The college has offered me the job. But I've decided to continue working as an Advocate. Nothing more to say. Thanks to everyone who supported me. Thank you. Please! Come. Along with everyone else, I also... Hey! It's nobody's fault. Just consider that we're starting our life afresh from today. Please understand the current situation. Let Sridevi and your son stay away from here, for the time being. I don't think these media guys will spare us. Moreover, that ex-Minister Mathew... He will make full use of this opportunity. He can go to any extent. And you're aware of their influence in the harbour, right? That's another reason why I'm saying this. - Let them stay away for now. - Iype! I haven't done anything illegal. And that's exactly why I don't fear anyone. Iype, I'm making this clear again! Nobody is going away from here. Mom, move away! - Hari! - Dad! Are you okay? - Dad! - Move back! Don't go! Wait! Harish, stop! Hey, Sree... Cut this melodrama. You guys go and stay at Palakkad for two weeks, for the time being. Don't divulge too much to mom. Just tell her that I'm trying to sort everything out. How will we pay the money, Hari? Is there any option besides paying? We were planning to sell the house anyway, right? That would be enough to cover it, I guess. Once I pay the compensation, I need to decide about the appeal, along with Iype. Well, will there be any point in filing an appeal, Dad? Isn't all the evidence in his favour? I'll end everything then. Is that okay with you? Sorry. - Oh no! - Shucks! These guys... Don't worry. Come what may, don't step out. Okay? Hari... What have you done? Having a large car doesn't mean others should have less space to move! Why the hell are you silent? Oh no! Sir, in this case, I completed the investigation, following all the protocols. And all the evidence was against Nishanth. Even my superior at the time was actively monitoring everything. No one had any doubts then. But in the name of this setback from the court, I cannot accept them hunting me on the streets like this, sir. There's a big game at play behind this. I will expose it. Harish... Your only option now is to come to a compromise with Minister Mathew. Because your current situation is really pathetic. So, in the midst of that, you won't be able to bear his grudge as well. During the next Sessions Court hearing, just change your statement. Tampering with evidence is not new to you, right? And if it's protection that you need, just give a written complaint. I'll take my time and think about it. I have an urgent video conference to attend. You may talk to my secretary. ♪ Time uncovers me, through moments thick and rife ♪ ♪ One day, gently, sunshine will cut through like a knife ♪ I worked sincerely for the police department, for so long. I earned the animosity of so many people, by taking impartial actions. And yet, a retirement like this? I just can't take this! Where did we go wrong? Was Salam wrong? Or... did the lab go wrong? Or... did I go wrong? Hey! Nishanth isn't what we assume him to be, Iype. Be it in my life or in my profession, I haven't done anything without proper homework or ground-work, till date. What are you saying? Nishanth, who was in jail for seven years, got out and toppled such a high-profile case, just like that? So, are you trying to imply that I was wrong? - We're humans, right? Anyone can go wrong. - No, no! I haven't gone wrong. I won't, either. I'm not ready to accept defeat. Wait and watch! I will prove that I haven't gone wrong. Drake! Drake! Drake! Drake! Drake! Bloody son of a bitch! I can't help but be a little philosophical now. Today marks your comeback, Professor. But it's also a reminder of perpetual guilt for some of us. Forget all that, Professor. We can't forget it so easily, Professor. We still feel guilty that we had testified against you. For that, definitely... you know, we'll make it up to you. For now, I wish that this new venture of Professor Nishanth becomes a huge success. You...!! You can win, celebrate or do anything you want! But for that, how could you do this to my poor Drake? I won't spare you or that Minister Mathew! Let go of him! Let go of him! - Let go of Nishanth! - Let go of him! Move away! - Move away! - Saji, no! Move away! After framing him in a false case, how dare you come here and do this nonsense? - Saji, stop it. - Nishanth, don't spare him! - Move away, you... - No! - Go away! - Stop it, guys! Let go of him! What is this, Hari? Did you send us here for you to get drunk and create a ruckus? YouTube and Instagram are full of your videos, Hari. Our Drake! They killed him, Sree! I can't bear this! Shouldn't you ask Minister Mathew about killing Drake? Why did you create a ruckus at Nishanth's house for that? You've caused such a disgrace for no reason, Harish. Harish! Hello? What are you doing, Harish? Why are you doing this to yourself? Everyone is only bothered about themselves, Harish. He won the case, and started a new life. Even... I think he is innocent. You know, Harish... Everyone has forgotten this case. It's time to let go and... move on. Yeah! Do you think... I can? If I close my eyes, I can only see Teresa. This is not fair! And I believe... justice has not been served. And... I cannot let it go! It's... It's not a question of fairness or justice. Everyone asked me to plug off Teresa's life support system. I cannot do that, Harish! I cannot do that. All my savings... I will spend it for Teresa. You know? At least till the Alzheimer's takes me completely. Yes! My greatest pain... are my memories about her. But, very soon... I will forget my daughter. And... you know, that is my destiny. Yeah. You should also forget her. I have lost everything! I don't want you to lose everything too. Okay? You have a family. I have already lost mine. I know that you'll have many doubts, as first year law students. I may not be able to answer all of them. Anyway, I'll try my level best. - You may ask me. - Sir! You had to endure a harsh sentence for a crime you didn't commit, solely because the evidence was against you, in the eyes of the law. So, did you doubt the Indian Judiciary, at any point, while serving time at the prison? Never! As a human, I've felt angry... during the initial years. But it's the same Judiciary that restored my honour as a citizen. Had it not been for this system, I would still have been behind bars like a murderer. Professor Nishanth was brought to this prison, after I joined here. He's an innocent chap. During his initial days in the jail, he was always beaten up. Sex offenders are the ones who are attacked the most, in every prison. We don't really do anything to protect them. And... when "Nari" (Nari) Suni dislikes someone, nobody in the jail, including the cops, would even smile at them. "Nari" Suni? The old Ibrahim Haji murder case? Yes, the same guy. There was no dearth of his influence here. Money laundering deals that happened outside, hit jobs, and even settlements... He would sort them all, sitting here, in jail. He was earning millions, even behind bars. Quick! Hey, come! Suni is calling you. Come on. They will start now. Shouldn't we reach there before they kill him? Come. I spared that Professor when I heard his actual story, sir. We've seen so many devils. But this guy is innocent. A naive fellow. He's not the type to turn to violence. Ever since I became friends with him, I myself have started thinking about giving up violence and hit jobs. Don't scorn, sir. What if I change for the better? Some people can turn mud into gold, sir. That's how influential Professor Nishanth was, in this prison. A character whom even Nari Suni respected. Everyone held him in great regard. To be frank, none of us believe that he could commit the crime unlike what you proved, Harish. Unlike other lawyers, we don't handle cases that pay fees in the millions. I don't accept them either. I fight for the common people. So, there will be plenty of cases. See! Sometimes, the fees we receive for a case might be a cup of tea. If you can manage with all that, you can do your internship here. - Okay? - Sure, sir. Let's go. Murugan... You know precisely why I've come here. Don't beat around the bush. Let's get straight to the point. I agreed to meet you, since I don't have anything to hide, sir. A few years back, when I made the choice to reform myself, I wrote a letter to Nishanth sir. He didn't respond initially. Later, he sent me a reply... saying that it's alright. Following his release from prison, he came to see me here once. And he asked me whether I was ready to say the truth in court. I said I'm ready to say it anywhere, sir. That's... That's when... he gained the confidence to reopen the case. I know that I can't correct all my sins, sir. But I could make amends at least for this one. And what did your "Sir" give you, for making those amends? When he tapped me on my shoulder, he had tears in his eyes. - Seeing that was enough for me, sir. - Is this how... he tapped your shoulder, you rascal? What is it, sir? Do you have trouble accepting that you've made a mistake, sir? - I get that, sir. - Come on, move. - Walk! - Hey! You can try to trick the court and the people with your ash-smeared forehead and fake spirituality, but there's a higher court above. I'll expose you there! Nishanth, one last question. You are a real life hero for many people. What do you have to say? I'm filled with a sense of calm. And, as Neethu said, if I've been able to inspire so many people, I feel really happy. Awww! So sweet! So, we're winding up this interview session. Listeners, stay tuned to Club FM 94.3 Next up is a photo session. Are you ready, sir? Okay. Who are you? Isn't this Burglar Murugan's house? Yes. Before Murugan went to jail, he used to give a share of his stolen funds, at this house too. But once he went to jail, this mother and her two daughters fell into abject poverty. She used to work as a labourer then, sir. This Rema had a habit of buying lottery tickets. And you know what? Around 3-4 years back, she won the lottery and got Rs. 80 Lakhs, sir. The newspapers had carried this news back then. Thanks to that, this family was rescued, I swear! What is it, Sree? It's been 3-4 days since you called, Hari. And you don't answer my calls either. What is this? I was really busy. I'm sorting everything out here. Vijay wants to come back there. He wants to see his dad. No, no! Nobody has to come here. There's not even a chair to sit here. The house will be sold next week. I'll finish everything and come there. Both of you remain right there. Are you drunk, Hari? Hari! Hari! No! This load is supposed to reach Patthanamthitta at 9 a.m. today. If you keep lazing around, other guys will send their loads there. If we're unable to send the loads, we'll be screwed. Better load it quickly! Come on! Are you here to buy fish? We don't do retail sales here. No. I've come to talk to you. What's the matter? I'm not interested in giving new supplies. It's not that. It's about a case. Your wife... had filed a paternity case long back, right? Let go of me! Let go of me! Move away! Move! If there's anything between me and my wife, we'll talk it out. Just because you goofed up in your job, don't try to act smart with me... You scoundrel! You rascal! You guys took money from that scoundrel, staged a drama, and denied justice to an innocent girl. I won't spare any of you! I won't spare any of you! What happened to Harish sir? He was drunk, so early in the morning. Convincing him not to file a case was a real struggle for me. I heard that he created some problems at Kannur Jail too. Ever since he lost that case, he has been quite depressed. You know, right? This won't happen again. I'll take care of that. Anyway, thank you, Suresh. Iype, please try to understand. Please believe me! All this is part of Nishanth's meticulous planning. During his time in jail, spanning five years, he fabricated stories using people and money, and executed this master-plan. Yeah, right! There's more to Nishanth than meets the eye. Harish, aren't these your assumptions? Aren't they? That's the problem here. Your assumptions don't reflect the reality. Understand that first! You made a mistake for the first time in your career. Even we made the same mistake, while supporting you. You know what sensible people do, when they make a mistake? They will acknowledge it, and they will move on. But I am not wrong! You're repeating the same thing? Try to pay that money first! I'll help you if you want me to. And stop this pointless and investigation and your damn drinking! It will only ruin you and your family! Stop this madness! He thinks he's bloody Sherlock Holmes. Answer the phone. Hello? The Legislator Purushotthaman made a strong statement against the residents of Attappadi, the other day. To discuss about this topic, we have a legal expert, Advocate Nishanth, who's joining us today. What do you know about this case? MLA Purushotthaman's statements are utterly... disappointing and extremely deplorable. This defamation case against him, will definitely stand in court. Hey! Write! His statement that goes, "Like people of Attappadi, who got shocked seeing a ship", is definitely punishable under IPC section 499 and there's no doubt about it. People who make such statements... It would be advisable if they are aware of SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act/ But if this section has to be imposed, the FIR or... When that man grilled him at court, the entire town came to know that he's a chronic alcoholic. Out of that depression, he started drinking again, and he couldn't stop it at all. It became such a disgrace for us, and everyone came to know about it. Finally, he mixed poison in his drink and drank it. It's sheer luck that he survived. That Professor has reclaimed his life, didn't he? Very good. We both made mistakes, didn't we? Never, Salam. I should never have testified in court. When he questioned me in court, even I felt that he was right. Alcohol is a strange intoxicant, sir. I tried really hard to quit. I managed somehow for a couple of years after that girl's case. Later, I started drinking again somehow. I tried quitting many times. But I couldn't. Sometimes, even complete strangers would buy alcohol for us. Finally, it took me to this point. While I was in the hospital, I felt like seeing you, sir. That's why I called you. What happened to you, sir? You look really worn out. I think your situation is much worse than mine, sir. Tell me, Sreedevi. Iype... Hari is not answering his phone. I'm really stressed. Can you please go and check on him? I met him the other day. I'll go, check and call you back. Okay. It's me. So, you've decided to ruin yourself! Iype! I traversed all the paths he explored. No use! But I've found a way to trap him! Arunima. She is the key! Iype... Please listen to me patiently. Nishanth is really brilliant, man! He is adept at keeping a low profile. But no matter how hard a psychopath like him tries to stay hidden... His obsession, his urge... He cannot keep it under control for long. He will attack girls again. Girls like Teresa are his type. That's the recurring pattern among his victims. He won't be able to break that. This is his intern, who has joined his office recently. Arunima, who's in her first year of college. Smart and dynamic! He will attack her! Or he will try to attack her. That's when I will... - catch... - Harish! As a friend who've known you well for many years, I'm telling you this, one last time. Please! Please stop this madness! Chasing his obsession relentlessly, you have crossed the phase of obsession, and you're becoming paranoid. If you continue this, the next time we'll be meeting in a very bad situation. Did you hear me? And yeah... It's the order from the court. If you don't pay the compensation to Nishanth within two weeks, the Government will seize all your wealth and recover it. Otherwise, it will be deducted from your retirement benefits, including your pension.

What did you do to that girl? We may consider this as the final chapter in the Nishanth-Harish battle. Ex-DCP Harish Madhav has been arrested. He has been following me for a while now. But initially, I didn't take it seriously. Later on, he began following me wherever I went. And today... when nobody else was around, he... Iype, his state of mind is in turmoil. Sir. The media has come to know about it. It will be a real disgrace. A police officer... That too, such a reputed officer, doing something like this? Anyway, Arunima, good job. You are pretty bold. Take her to the hospital and then drop her home. - Okay? - Okay, sir. Sir... Harish? We'll take him straight to the Magistrate's residence. He won't get bail for sure. He'll be remanded to the sub-jail tomorrow. After that, it's in the court's hands to decide. If we hadn't received that anonymous tip-off, we wouldn't have arrived there on time. That girl's life could have been in danger as well. Iype... It wasn't me. Believe me! It wasn't me! Have you come to a point where you didn't hesitate to use even this young girl as a scapegoat to frame him? Wait and watch!! Not a single advocate will be willing to appear for your case. Ex-DCP Harish Madhavan who later retired as the Deputy Commandant, made an attempt to assault a girl, in the city today. This tragic incident occurred in Kochi. - Mom! - This girl, who's a first year law student was stalked and assaulted by Harish Madhavan, as per the police reports. He was always a miscreant! He's a menace to our entire city! When he was in service, he would harass any common man he could lay hands on. I stand as a living testament to that fact. Since we need more clarity, we're in constant touch with the police officials. - The Home Minister... - I'll be back soon. has demanded a report from the Police Commissioner. Though the reason for the arrest isn't clear yet, Harish... Sir! Your Advocate is here to meet you. Ideally, I should be handling Arunima's case. And then, I should trap you! But I am not you! I know that nobody will be willing to take up your case. That's why I am here. Sit down. You need to sign the authorization letter. You'll be presented in court within two days. You won't get bail initially. Given the gravity of the offence, we should emphasize your present circumstances and the mental strain you've experienced, and play a mental insanity card. The court may mandate supervisory de-addiction and psychotherapy for you. You can come out clean in around 6-7 months. I know that you still see me as an enemy. That's your choice. You can call me anytime. God bless! IT Act 10AA. Omega Infotainment LLP. Abuja City, Nigeria. Omega Infotainment. The overseas shell company that you established for Nari Suni, during your time in prison. I know, Nishanth. I know everything! Hey, come! Suni is calling you. If the tax officials can come there, they can access the other location as well. We need to shift a total of Rs. 6 Crores. I'm tired of lugging it around, auditor! Tell me a solution. If I declare and settle the whole amount in cash, won't there be an inquiry about its source? What the hell will I say then, you bloody chartered accountant? Brother, just fire that auditor of yours. Brother... I'll tell you how to make all this cash white, without paying a single Rupee in taxes. Sunil amassed Crores of black money through Hawala and hit job settlements, and you counselled him on its legitimization. And you got it executed. Suniletta, first, the black money in your possession should be routed to the Middle East through Hawala. And from there, it should be taken to Abuja City, Nigeria. Abuja City is a tax-free area. You need to register a company there, and start an off-shore account. At the same time, you need to start an IT company in your wife's name, at the Special Economic Zone here. We'll generate a dummy software at this company and send it there. As part of its billing, we can receive millions of Rupees transferred here from Nigeria. The Government always entertains the inflow of foreign currency. Moreover, the start-ups that are formed in such special economic zones, need not pay taxes for five years. That's IT Act 10AA. We can make everything white! Just that it will take some time. What have you studied, Professor? For someone with a PhD in finance and taxation like you, executing this task was a breeze. Legitimately! Suni, a gang leader, was reborn as a businessman named Sunil quite effortlessly, within a couple of years. And you were behind his rebirth. As soon as you got Nari Suni on your side, you targeted the lab. If you were truly innocent, you would have gone for an appeal, the day after the verdict was pronounced. The semen sample found from Teresa's body, was stored in the lab. You were aware that it would work against you. You waited until the sample was no longer valid. Hey "Nut"! - Yes! - Nari Suni is calling you. I'll come. You carry on. How old is your daughter now? She's two years old now. When I was sent to jail, she was just two months old. Oh! So, once you're out of here, you can go meet your daughter, right? Yes, yes. Around 3-4 months after your release from prison, you should ask your wife, to file a complaint at the nearest police station; stating that you aren't taking care of her and not providing for them. Then, the cops will summon you. And what will you say then? You should claim that the child is not yours. Hey! She is my own daughter! The case will reach the court. The court will order a paternity test. The initial report will indicate that the child is not yours. Your wife will approach a higher court, requesting another test. The DNA will be tested simultaneously at three reputed labs in India, and all three will yield the same result; that your daughter is indeed your own child. The Higher Court will declare that the first test was a failure. And... for doing this, you'll be given some money. By some money, I mean around 10-15 Lakhs. And, you will also have Sunilettan's lifelong friendship. You're getting out of jail after serving your sentence, right? You have to survive, right? I obtained the full list of inmates in prison, during the period when you and Nari Suni served time together. That's what... led me to the Jijo connection. Your subsequent moves were all precise and well calculated. You skilfully harnessed Nari Suni's extensive network. Baburaj! Look who's here! Therandi? Who is with you? This is John Samuel sir. He lives in Thiruvani. Sir, please have some tea. Ah! Salam Ikka, right? Err... Yes. Didn't you recognize me? I don't really... During the flat construction at Pathadippalam, I was with you for a few days. - Hey, get us two drinks, 90ml each. - I don't need it. Have it, Ikka. What else is happening? All good? - Muruganna. - Yes. There's a request from Viyyur jail. It will be beneficial for you. I don't have the money to buy this property from him. We will give you the money. As soon as this property sale is over, you should file a civil case, and say that a document I handed over to you, was forged. My dear Salam Ikka, I've been calling you for so long. - Who are you? - We got drunk at the bar yesterday, right? Hop on. Let's go have a couple of drinks. Hop on, Salam Ikka. It's time! Careful! Don't fall. Hold tight. Hey, Rema. You should do something. You should go to our nearby shops and buy as many lottery tickets as you can. And you should check it in front of people. Check whether you've won. We don't have money to buy rice. And you want me to buy lottery tickets? Have you gone crazy? The money will reach you! By the time I get out of here, I'll be as good as dead. Shouldn't I do something for you and our children? I've brought what you asked for. Nari Suni sent this for you, for your efforts. You fixed a really strong drink. Yeah, right! The third ticket also didn't win, Rema Chechi. It's alright. I just hope I win it someday. We should keep buying them. Shall I give you another one? Yes, please. Claiming that I forged this death certificate, you should file a case. Rest everything, as we agreed. Okay. Don't fall! - Go carefully, Salam Ikka. - Don't worry about that. - What's your name? - My name is Suneesh. Suneesh, right? Suneesh... - Let's have a drink each. - The bar is closed! I'll sort that out. - Come on then. - I'll make them open it. Who is it? Here you go, Chechi. This is a Kerala lottery ticket. This is the ticket from Thrissur that won 80 Lakhs. 80 Lakhs? You can exchange it at any bank. If anyone asks you, just say that you bought it from Shankarankulangara in Thrissur. Even your children needn't know about this. Once you get the money, Murugan has asked you to call him on this number. - Okay. I will call him. - Okay, Chechi. The report can be manipulated in various ways. The lab examiner may go wrong. The equipment can falter. There can be a data error where the report is printed. And any staff member... can be bribed or blackmailed. Apart from all these, even the sealed samples that come from the court, can be replaced before they are delivered to the lab. If you have money and influence, you can find plenty of inner connections. Salam had told me that even complete strangers would buy alcohol for him. Thereby, you made him a chronic alcoholic, sent him to de-addiction centres several times, and destroyed his credibility. Jijo, John Samuel and Murugan's lottery ticket were all... mere pawns in your grand scheme. Very nice, Nishanth. Brilliant! These stories are very interesting. Driven by your thirst for revenge against me, are you becoming delusional now, sir? Mental insanity! We can actually plead that in court. Let me see if I can get you out on bail. Good luck. Safiya Sait. Year, 1991. During the investigation of the Teresa case, I had made a mistake, Nishanth. The method you used to assault Theresa, was something you had practised and perfected over time. It exhibited all the traits of a psychopath. Yet, I considered it as a random incident, failed to dig up your background, and do a full profiling. It was a grave mistake on my side. I corrected it this time. Safiya Sait. Calicut University student. D1 Representative. A great orator, organizer, smart and intelligent. She was anticipated to become the chairman of Calicut University. One day, in a remote corner of the campus, she burned to death, while sitting in the second-hand car her father had gifted her. A mysterious death. During that time, you were... a second-year postgraduate student at the same campus. JCM University, Banaras. First year student, Sunita Sharma. That girl went missing one day. About a year and a half later, during the excavation of the university's bushy area for a new construction project, that girl's skeletal remains were unearthed. The postmortem report revealed only one piece of evidence: her neck bones were fractured. During that time, you were completing your PhD there. Sunita also... was smart, intelligent and dynamic. Just like Safiya. Just like Teresa Philip. The resemblances in age and character among the girls who were murdered. The five or six-year intervals between each death. And your clear presence at each of those locations. To believe that all these are just mere coincidences, it's impossible. Asha Mathew. My pre-degree senior. You didn't find that, huh? She was my neighbour. The all-rounder at the youth festival that year. She was in a strong love affair... with a Hindu boy. Once, I caught her near my house. She tried to escape, slipping away from my grasp. You know these old chains we can find at our backyard? What do they say? The chain that's used on dogs? I strangled her using it. Like this! The sound of the windpipe being crushed... was audible even amidst the sounds of everything else. Life leaving her body through the windpipe, like thin air... I could sense it up from the closest range. Because... I was inside her. While enjoying that body, I knew that... I was in the peak of my orgasm. Then... Controlling a life with your own hands, and blending it back into nature as an orgasm. That's such an extraordinary experience. Saying that she wanted to meet her boyfriend, I took him to the same spot. And with a crowbar I found lying there, I made just one blow! He was dead! I dug up a pit in the forest for the two of them, and planted a mango sapling over it. I planted a rumour that they were in love and may have eloped. Poor guy! Her younger brother and I... have relished several mangoes from that mango tree. So sweet! You are sick... and beyond repair! You are a devil! Teresa might have met a similar end, Harish; if Salam hadn't come there. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been caught either. But I am out of the cage. The Devil cannot be caged, Harish. Because... Devil is not human. He is half-God himself. Yes! Now listen to this as well, Harish. All psycic killers get caught, when they continue their killings, without breaking their patterns. Once the obsession to follow a pattern is fed into their psyche, it never leaves them. Your reading was correct. Arunima was the best target. "Was". She wasn't my target. She was the target I used, to trap you. But... you broke your pattern. This night, while the entire city police was running around to arrest you, I caught my next prey, Harish. - What happened? He didn't come? - It's raining. Get in, I'll drop you. Come in. It's been raining for so long! And I broke my pattern. I haven't killed her yet. I am about to kill her. The fact that you're behind bars, unable to stop it, gives me a bonus kick! The day... The day you get out on bail, you'll be arrested again. Hey! Neethu! Don't strain too much. If you strain too much, the oxygen intake will increase. The oxygen inside the cover will drop considerably. You'll run out of breath. Be a doll and stay still. I'll be back. Because, from beneath the floor of one of the rooms in your house, her decomposed body will be found. Along with that, the city will get a new psycho killer too. What are you doing? Let go of him! Sorry to keep you waiting, Neethu. I had gone to settle a personal score. I won't hurt you much. May I? While you were witnessing my downfall, you failed to notice the eagle eyes of Kerala Police, who were monitoring every move of yours. Party, Salute! Harish had come and met me with all the necessary documents, a month ago. We were all over you, discreetly; including the cyber police. Everything was planned, Nishanth. The Kerala Police has never had a history of disowning one of our own efficient officers. And this tradition won't change in the future either. By making you believe that I had become obsessed, the investigation came to a halt and that I ruined my life due to alcoholism; I triggered your obsession to kill. That was the reverse psychology I applied here. Nishanth, once a cop, always a cop! And I am a bloody cop! Your Honour, I request you to initiate a comprehensive investigation into several individuals, including Nari Suni, taking cues from this case. I respectfully request you to grant the necessary time required for the police to unravel the mysteries of this conspiracy. One second, Your Honour. Your Honour, in addition to the existing charges, there's also an additional charge to consider. It's 302. Teresa, who was in coma, passed away today. Your Honour, in addition to the existing charges of IPC Section 320 grievous hurt and rape charge under Section 376... filed against Nishanth in Teresa case, I request this court to add... an additional charge of IPC Section 302 for murder. Therefore, I humbly request the court to alter the charges against the accused in accordance with Criminal Procedure Code Section 216. This court hereby orders that the Kerala Police will be tasked with conducting further investigation into Nishanth, the accused in this case. Additionally, the court mandates an in-depth probe into Sunil Kumar, alias Nari Suni, Murugan, John Samuel, Smitha Jijo and Jijo Manalil, who provided assistance to the accused in this case, by including them as co-accused. - Finally, that battle is over, right? - Yes. But you could have shared this plan of yours with me! I could have. But your acting skills don't quite measure up to mine. The look on your face suggests an arrogance, as though you're confident you'll return even stronger. This time you won't. There won't be any Nari Suni coming to your rescue! In prison, you will always be under the watchful eye of The Eagle! What's that? Huh? What is it? Huh? Drake! That was his name. So? Have you seen the movie, "John Wick"? The favourite movie among youngsters? John Wick! Hey! Where's the driver?
