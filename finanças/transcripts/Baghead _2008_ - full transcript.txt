MAN ON SCREEN: Baby, come down here right now and talk to me. I love you. I love you! WOMAN ON SCREEN: You're full of shit. MAN: I love you. You know that thing I said I would never do? I'm gonna do it right now. Right now, I'm gonna do it! WOMAN: I don't believe you. Why? What's different this time? MAN: I'll show you what's different this time. Sweet. (LAUGHS) Shut up. Yeah. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (WHISTLES) Hi, everybody. Thank you for coming. I'm Kristin Thompson. I'm the director of the Los Angeles Underground Film Festival. We are very lucky today to have the filmmaker. I'd like to welcome Jett Garner to come down for a few questions. (MAN WHOOPING) Thank you very much. Testing. Yes. Questions? Yes, sir? What was your budget? I actually shot it slightly under $1000, and... (MAN EXCLAIMS) Well, it's actually about twice as much as I wanted to shoot it for, so... Yes? How did you do it so cheap? Well, I used my parents' camera. They had a mini DV camera, and mini DV tapes aren't that expensive. And I shot it in my town, and shot it with real light. You know, Hollywood has us convinced that it takes $100 million to make a quality piece of art, and that's a piece-of-crap statement. I think you just saw that, right? So, any other questions or comments? Yes? Was there any improvisation? Well, that's an interesting question, and I guess I would come back with another question. When you wake up in the morning, do you think about what you're going to say to everyone during the day? No. So why do that in film? In fact, a lot of those scenes are completely real. The people in the scenes had no idea that they were on film. You know, we had kind of... Well, I don't want to give away all my secrets, but we had some... What's the word? Camouflage going on, so some of the people you see in there didn't even know they were in a movie until I showed them a few weeks ago back in my hometown. Any other questions or comments? KRISTIN: Great. Thank you so much. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Thank you, Jett Garner. And also, I just want to remind everybody that the afterparty is at Arts on Real, so we'll see you there. CATHERINE: No, I was not, Chad. MICHELLE: So, what's the deal? All right, so, here's the deal. We need to be on the list, or we need to have one of those little badges. Okay. I really want to go to this party. CATHERINE: Yeah, we'll get in. MATT: All right. It will be really fun. There's a back door, right on the left hand side. There's gotta be a way we can get in, all right? MICHELLE: Look, it's Jett Garner. CATHERINE: Honey, you know him. Go talk to him. MATT: He's not going to remember me. Hey. Hey, Jett Garner. Hi. Dude. Matt, I thought that was you. Hey, man. What's up, man? What's up, man? How are you? I'm all right. How are you? Congratulations. Your film was awesome. I'm glad you liked it. I was so blown away, man. Good. Good. It was amazing. I'd love to talk to you about it more. Definitely. Can I get your digits, so we can hook up? Yeah, yeah, man. Cool. Give me a call. Thanks, brother. You should call me. MAN: Jett, let's go. Thanks, Dave. I gotta get inside. So, you guys are coming in? Yeah. We're definitely coming in. You gotta look me up. I'll come in and find you. Okay. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Hey, guys. Thanks, man. Congratulations. Good seeing you. MICHELLE: Bye, Jett Garner. (LAUGHS) Bye. Did you just say his film was awesome? So is he getting us in? MATT: I didn't ask him. You didn't get the badge? No, I can't. That's... Why didn't you ask him for it? 'Cause it seemed desperate. You can't just ask somebody... CATHERINE: Yes, you can. You were just talking to him, and you're friends with him. You pussed out, dude. He's got his parents. He's got his friends. You can't do that. You guys, you guys, I got it. Just watch me. MATT: What is she doing? She's amazing. CATHERINE: If she gets in, I'll shit. MATT: She's not gonna get in. Look at that girl go. She just got in. She just got in. I'm going, too. Fuck. Chad. Excuse me. Hey. Hi. Hi. Mr. Wallet-phone, are you on the list? Yeah. Jett Garner. Is there a problem here? That's not your name. Just do me a favor and walk away. Do yourself a favor and walk away. I'm not gonna deal with this. Okay. Matty, your face looks sad. Is it okay if I call you Matty? You can call me Matty. I'm just bored. MICHELLE: Really? You bored? You want me to call someone for you on your phone? Yeah, no. The afterparty was horrible, so we left and we decided to come to O'Sullivan's and have some cocktails. MATT: That's funny. It's really off the hook here. Yeah, that's very funny, Chad. It was a good idea. It was a good idea. MATT: It was inventive. I have to go to the bathroom. Michelle, would you like to come with me? Yeah. CATHERINE: Okay, boys. See you in a second. Bye. I was noticing some illegal contact in the movie theater. What are you talking about? Catherine had her hand on your back. Dude, it's fine. Chad, don't worry about it. Catherine and I are over. Okay. So, I don't know if this is sensitive or whatever, but I was... Do you... Have you and Matt dated? Let's see. We've gone out on and off for about 11 years. It's like... You guys are going out right now? We've gotten to the point where we don't need to label anything. You know, we're definitely soul mates. He's definitely the love of my life. That's cool. I really like your necklace a lot. It's really pretty. Thank you. Actually, my agent gave me this. I don't have an agent. You don't? No, but... Aw... I'm gonna get one. Yeah. When was the last time one of us had a major role in a feature film? It's been a long time. Never. We've never had a role in a big film. So, you write a part for Michelle. Right? Mmm-hmm. We write a part for you. Write a part for me. Write a part for Catherine. Yeah, I... This will jump start our career, dude. It'll launch our career if we just do it. I mean, if Jett Garner can do it, we can do it. I don't know. We gotta do this! Right now, I'm hanging out with Michelle. Things are going good between me and her. I think things are clicking. I feel like something's really going to happen between me and her. So, how long have you known Chad? About three months or so. Wow, and are... Do you like him? Yeah. Good. But not... Friend-like. Oh. Oh. Oh. Does he know that? We'll spend a whole weekend. We'll just create together. We'll spend a weekend together. That's what I'm talking about. It's brilliant. CATHERINE: Hey. Hey, ladies. MICHELLE: Hi. Girls, we have a brilliant idea. It's a genius idea. We're going to write a movie this weekend. CHAD: My uncle has a cabin on Big Bear. We drive up there this weekend. We hole up. We write a feature film that stars us. There's gonna be parts for all of us, right? We're gonna write things that are suited... MICHELLE: So we're gonna be in this movie? CHAD: Right. Like Jett Garner did, but his movie sucked. Jett Garner's movie sucked, but... MATT: Sucked butt, right? CATHERINE: Yeah, that's great. Good. This'll be... MICHELLE: I think it's a great idea. CATHERINE: Awesome. MICHELLE: When are we going? CATHERINE: Yeah, when? I think we should go tonight. MICHELLE: Cool. Wow. So this is it, you know? This is really nice. The kitchen area. The living area, over there. We can eat there. Bathroom and bedroom upstairs, and the two bedrooms next door. MICHELLE: This is awesome. I'm just not sure where I should put my... Where should we put our luggage now, Chad? * We don't have any motherfucking ideas * This movie ain't gonna happen * But I do know that Michelle is fine (LAUGHS) * She's blowing, blowing my mind Michelle * That's me * That's you * That's me MATT: * That's them * That's you Oh, God. Let's do this, all right? One time we're going to get the plot down, that's it. All right, before we go to sleep, we'll all come up with the plot. We'll come up with at least... All right, we have four characters. There's four people. There's four actors. What happens? Come on, Chad. What happens? What do you want to happen? Love. I want love to happen. All right. Love. Who's in love? The main character is in love with someone. Or two people. (BURPS) Sorry. CHAD: It's okay. CATHERINE: Someone's a little bit buzzed. CHAD: That was cute. There's that, and there's some other guy who is like snorting cocaine off the back of the toilet. There's a guy taking a shit. There's, like, all these people just hanging out in the bathroom. And then they get stuck. They get stuck in the bathroom, and nobody can leave, right? So they're all in the bathroom. And they're just like... MICHELLE: That's like... They're stuck in the bathroom. CHAD: * Michelle Yes? Let's go back to the apartment thing. (CHAD AND MICHELLE LAUGH) * Can you hear me whispering? * Yes. MATT: Chad. CATHERINE: You guys, listen. MICHELLE: Where's my beer? Yoo-hoo. CHAD: I moved it, so it didn't spill. MATT: Chad. Chad. Listen, Matt's asking you something. All right. Come on. Let's just keep it simple, Chad. Chad. MICHELLE: I'm pooped. I gotta go to bed. MATT: Don't go to sleep. Come on. Good night. The idea that you had was great. I gotta go to sleep. No. Come on. I gotta go. I gotta go to sleep. MATT: Michelle. Good night. MATT: Michelle, wait, wait. Come on. Michelle. Michelle. Wait a second, Michelle. Good night. You guys get good ideas. MATT: Chad. Chad, let's do this. Come on. I'm going to bed. MATT: Dude, you can't go to bed. Yes. It's so early. Come on. I am sacking out. Chad. We love you. I'm out. Later, dawg. (DOOR CLOSES) (DOOR OPENS) Hey. Hey. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. You just seemed sort of, I don't know, upset. You walked out. I thought maybe something was wrong. No, I'm fine. That's good. It's pretty clear that the movie thing is not working out. I don't think that's true. Come on, it was a pretty stupid idea. No, it's not stupid at all. To think that we're all gonna come up here and actually do something for once. I think it's a great idea. How many times have we said that, that we're gonna do something? And then we start, and then we never finish it. But we are gonna finish it, and that's the point. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Yeah? Hi. Hey. What's going on? Nothing. How are you? I am doing... Pretty, pretty, pretty good. Pretty, pretty, pretty good. That's good. That's really good. I... I just wanted to tell you... Mmm-hmm? That I think you're amazing. I think you're amazing, too. Chad, you're so amazing. No, but I really think that you are probably the most sweet and innocent and pure people that I think I've ever met. That's what's so great about you. You're like... You're like... You're like my best friend, but also like my brother. I don't have brothers, but I feel like that's what they would do. That's what you do. You're everything. Chadworth. You're everything to me. You're, like, family and friend. (GIGGLING) You headbutted me. (GRUNTS) Yeah. Hey, you got my clips in your hair. I do. I do. I got a whole bunch of them. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I... You look funny. I do? Yeah. What do I look like? Yeah. You look like... Do I look like a clown? You look like a little toddler. Oh, God. (LAUGHING) Thanks so much for talking to me. Yeah. I really... I care about you. Yeah. And I'm so happy that you care about me, 'cause I don't know what I would have done in LA without you. Yeah. All right. Well, good night. Good night. All right. Good night. Wait, you left one. There's one more? Okay. Yeah. I need them. All right, well, good night. Good night. See you tomorrow. (DOOR CLOSES) You know I'm gonna take that strip class when I get back to LA? Oh, my God. Everybody's doing it, and I want to get that S, that curve thing going on. The pole class? I told you that. You've got a great ass. Why are you taking a pole dancing class? That's stupid. On a scale of 1-to-10, what is my ass? Get up. Let me see. It's better when you're bent over. Girls' butts always look best if they're on their knees. Get up and bend over. I mean, that's what I think. I don't know. Let me see. Shut up. You've seen it. Let me see your butt right now. No, you've seen it. You've seen it. All right, from memory? I'd say an 8.3. What? No frickin' way. 8.3? Nobody... You don't say that. It's a 10. Plus. No, you're right. It's a 10. That doesn't convince me. There is no scale from 1-to-10 with your ass. It's definitely an 11. That's my boy. You have an 11 ass, 11 ass, 11 ass. (SNORTS) (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) I'm cold. You know what sucks? What? What? Ever since we broke up, I'm not getting any. What? Well, you can get some if you play your cards right. (TINKLING) (GAGGING) (RETCHING) (COUGHING) Guys? (RUSTLING) (BIRDS CAWING) He had this sack over his face. CATHERINE: Hey. Hey! CATHERINE: Hi. And it was the scariest thing I've ever dreamt in my life. What are you talking about? I had this dream. I don't even know. What are you smiling about? That's it! MICHELLE: What? What? What? A guy running around in the woods with a bag over his head. He's killing people. CATHERINE: What are you talking about? That's our fucking movie. That's it. Note cards! Note cards! What? Wait a minute. Matt. What is going on? What are you guys talking about? MICHELLE: I just had this dream about a guy with a bag over his face, and Matt thinks it's gonna be a good movie. A bag over his face? Yeah. Well, we talked last night. We had a great conversation about doing a relationship movie, which I think would be great. It'd be more effective, don't you? You all conversed last night? Yeah, we totally brainstormed and came up with some great shit. You and Matt? Yeah. Yeah, and we came up with some really good ideas. I don't know about this bag thing. I mean, I didn't hear the first part of your dream, but... (LOUD THUD) (ALL SCREAM) Jesus Christ. Dude, that's not scary? Come on. CHAD: Fucking dick! Let's make a movie. It's so good, Matt. Matt, that's not funny. It's not supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be scary. And it is. Yeah, I know that, but I... Can you come in and finish the sausages, please? Catherine, can you give me some paper towels? I just shat on myself. Michelle. (BOTH SCREAMING) I don't think it's good. It's just... CHAD: Come on! Because you're more loud than anything, Matt. It's not 'cause of the bag over your head. If you come screaming and put yourself in a window, we're gonna scream. MATT: No, it's because of the bag over the head. Look. (SCREAMING) Right. Now what we need to do is come up with scenes. All right, this is the next step. We've gotta go into scenes. Okay, okay, wait. Before we get to the next step, let's celebrate what we have so far, and let's make some new drinks for the ladies. I can deal with that. MICHELLE: I agree. That's a great idea. Want me to help you guys? I can help you. CHAD: No, no, no. Just sit pretty. Right here. Helping you right now. Look, I'm helping. Thanks, Chad. Go get the cocktails. I actually need your mixing expertise. Chad, want to see me helping you? Chad, watch. I'm helping. MICHELLE: Chaddy and Matty, can you guys make me something sweet? Thank you. CATHERINE: Is that funny? That's funny? CHAD: Yes, that's hilarious. You're not laughing. He's not laughing. CHAD: I'm laughing on the inside. He's funny, usually. He's not that funny tonight. He's not that funny. MICHELLE: Who's not funny? Chad. He's funny, normally. He's very funny. MATT: What? Do you think Michelle and I can play boyfriend and girlfriend in the movie? Totally, dude. Really? Of course. When we go back inside, you gotta tell them, because you're leading the charge here. Right. I will. Awesome. You fucking rock. Okay. That was excessive, wasn't it? It was a little much. All right, here we go. CATHERINE: Somebody has a guilty conscience. I don't. I think we should have some shots. Some shots. I agree, but I want... I am not gonna mix this. I have the wine. I don't want to get sick. You're gonna do it with me. Yeah, I need a new cup. Can you go get me a new cup, Chaddy? Please? Thank you. CHAD: Okay, new cup? Fuck the cup. Let's just go right from the bottle. No, I can't do that. Why? Okay, fine. All right, here. Hold on. Okay, pour it in my mouth, like this. Go ahead. Ready? CATHERINE: Hello. This isn't... (COUGHS) All right, I'm with you. Hold on. Ready? MICHELLE: Okay. CATHERINE: Whatever. This is weird. Matty, I'm having some good ideas. CATHERINE: Excuse me. I think we should sit down and work on some note cards. All right, hold on. Let me put that down. CATHERINE: Matty. Well, he looks like a Matty. He's Matt, actually. He looks like a Matty. He's my Matty, which is cute. MICHELLE: Thank you. I don't even need it anymore. You don't need it? MICHELLE: Yeah, we just did it. He poured it in my mouth. CATHERINE: Isn't that romantic, Chad? You want to pour it in my mouth, Chad? Come here. Uh... I've been doing a little thinking. Sorry. The Chad character and the Michelle character, I think we've kind of created a problem, 'cause we're losing a romance angle between them, so I think that it would work better if they're not brother and sister anymore, and they're boyfriend and girlfriend. CATHERINE: That's awesome. We're boyfriend and girlfriend. MATT: Just because we have more places to go. We have more places to go. CATHERINE: That is such a good idea. Come here and give me hug. Hug. Hug on that one. MATT: And you and I, we're just gonna... CATHERINE: We're gonna be... We're just gonna be friends. With a sexual undercurrent. Right. All right, I remember now. This is it. This is what we're going to do. See these note cards? CHAD: Yeah. These note cards, what we're gonna do is we're gonna write down... CATHERINE: Let's write down something. We're gonna write down an idea. You write down the scene idea, and then you're gonna pass it to the next person, and the next person is gonna look at that idea, and they're gonna go on that idea with their own ideas and add to it. Then you just keep passing it around. CATHERINE: Okay. MATT: All right, you guys almost done? Hold on. No, you can't look at it. I'm not ready. Done. MATT: Are we good? MATT: Are you good? Yep. What the hell is this? CATHERINE: Quarterback of the Chicago Bears. Da Bears. What does it say? Jim Harbaugh. CATHERINE: Jim Harbaugh, how's it going? MATT: What the fuck is that? Once upon a time, he asked me out. I don't want to get Matt jealous, but... MATT: Are we good? So, are we writing a second one? MATT: You ready? Aren't you going to say whether or not you liked mine? Yours was... It was great. He liked it. It was awesome, Michelle. Yeah? You did an A-okay job. No peeking. Okay. Now I'm done. CATHERINE: You look mad at me. MATT: Cut it out, Catherine. CATHERINE: What? What? MATT: Just take that and look. CHAD: Should we just quit working and just get fucked up? CATHERINE: Bad time, Jesus? What is this? You guys, I'm getting so tired again. I think I'm gonna go to bed. So, I'm gonna brainstorm while I sleep, so I'll see you guys later. CATHERINE: Bye. Bye. Good night, movie girlfriend. Good night. God damn. CATHERINE: Good night, movie extra. Movie extra. I'm just kidding, guys. I know she's your little starlet. Little starlet. Little, little starlet. Little, little, little, little... Little, little, little, little... She just has a glow. She glows. She has this set of ample bosom that... She's just younger. ...that hits me where I don't know. Hello. (TINKLING) Oh, my God. You're being really scary. Come in. Oh, my God. You've got a bag on your head. Matt, that's really scary. Is this a game? Okay. Matt? (DOOR OPENS) Matt? (DOOR CLOSES) That was you, right? You scared the shit out of me. Someone just came into my room with a bag over their head and your clothes on. Tell me that was you. They're fucking with us. Who? This is not gonna be good. What? Catherine's gonna kill me. Catherine! It was fucking Catherine? How do you know that Catherine did this? Chad can't fit into my clothes. That fucking bitch. I'm going to... No, wait. We have to have a plan. Michelle. Michelle, come on, please. Shit. (SCREAMING) Not so funny now, is it? CATHERINE: Why did you do that? Because you did it to me. What are you talking about? I did it to you? You came in my room with a bag on your head, and you scared me. No, I didn't, Michelle. I've been sleeping here the whole night. Why did you just do that? No, you weren't! Yes, I was! You're a fucking liar. You're a fucking liar. What are you talking about? Wait, wait a second, guys. Michelle, what happened? Catherine came into my room with a bag over her head and scared the shit out of me, so I got her back. Catherine, did you go into her room and scare her? No, no, I didn't. Michelle, I swear to God, I didn't. Don't fuck with me, Catherine! I know that you did it. I didn't. I swear to God. You swear on your mother you didn't do it? Yes, I didn't do it. Then somebody saw me naked. This just gets better and better. They saw you naked. They saw you naked? Does this seem weird to you, Chad? (INDISTINCT NOISE) What's that? What is it? (HOWLING IN DISTANCE) Fuck. Guys, it's an animal. Relax. MATT: There's nothing out here. This is ridiculous. Matt? Matt? What? Did you fuck her? Did you fuck her already? Dude, I did not fuck her. Come on. Shit. Jesus, dude. You fucked her. (SIGHS) I didn't fuck her. You are the biggest fucking cock in the whole world. You just hit me. You just hit me. I just can't deal with it if you sleep with her. Oh, my God. I'm not gonna sleep with her. Swear on your left gonad that you will not have sex with Michelle. I swear I am not gonna fuck her. Fuck who? See, you're already trying... You're like Bill Clinton, trying to get out of it. I swear I am not going to fuck Michelle. Okay. Okay, that's good. You happy? Yes, I'm pleased. Wow, you're pathetic. Why? I'm just... Don't let anyone see you do that. I gotta fight. I gotta fight, man. You just aren't that big. You get all the fucking chicks. You've got Elvis hair. I mean, look at me, dude. I've got nothing. You're like Michael Jordan. I'm like Bill Laimbeer. (MATT LAUGHS) I've got no game. No, you have game. You got shitty self-esteem, dude. You're the funniest fucking person I know. Yeah, funny-looking. No. You're cute, and you're funny. I am? You totally are. Say it. What? I'm cute. I'm cute. And I'm funny. And I'm funny. Yeah, you are. What is that? So, naked? Wow. That must be some party. (APPLAUDING) That's awesome. You're good. No, I like the show. I like it. You know, I do get it. I get it. I totally... I was you. I played that game, and I understand it. But Matt means everything to me. So if you don't mind... (DOOR OPENING) MICHELLE: There's my actual vomit, so the chances are that there's a guy... MATT: There's nobody in the woods with a bag over his head. Yes, there are! It's something we made up. If one of you is messing with us, you better fess up right now. I don't really fucking care whether it was one of you guys messing with me, or if there's a guy in the woods. This situation is fucked, and I want out! MATT: Okay, everybody... Matt, I have no other way to get home! MATT: We need to regroup. MICHELLE: You have to take me home! MATT: Michelle, relax. No! I'm not going to relax. A baghead didn't come into your room. MATT: There's no baghead. Fuck you guys. Fuck all of you. I'm gonna go call a fucking cab if you won't help me. CHAD: There's a landline upstairs. Wait a second. What? What? Catherine did it. What? How do you know that? Found it in her purse. I'll take you home in the morning. I don't want to sleep alone. (TINKLING) Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Matt, wake up. Guys, it's late. It's almost noon. I can't find Catherine. I looked in all the bedrooms. I looked around outside for a bit. She's nowhere to be found. She's just fucking with us. Why would she be fucking with us? 'Cause she's mad. She didn't look mad to me. What is she mad about? 'Cause I said... I don't know. Come on, what? Spit it out. Okay, so, I wrote these notes to Matt. You wrote notes to Matt? I wrote a note to Matt, which Catherine found, and she's probably just mad. What kind of note? It just was... You know, Catherine's just jealous. Okay. What did the note say? I was just joking. She was just fucking around. CHAD: And the note said... And the note said... It just said, "Come to my room." But it was, like, a joke. And then Catherine found it, and that's why she came to my room with a bag on her head. So your note to Matt, which was a joke, said, "Come into my room"? Basically, yeah. Got you. MATT: It was a really dumb joke. MICHELLE: I'm really sorry. It was a joke. It was a joke. She was just kidding, Chad. MICHELLE: Where are you going? Fuck you guys. (MICHELLE GROANS) This sucks. We're always in trouble, and we didn't even do anything. It's not like we didn't do anything. We kind of deserve it. (LOUD SCREAM) What was that? What's that? MATT: His shirt. It's Chad's shirt. Chad? Chad. You gotta be cold without your shirt, honey. This is pathetic. He even did a mini piece down here. So well thought out. Look at this. That's scary, Chad. (EXCLAIMS SARCASTICALLY) Jeez. Pathetic. Guys, we're real scared here. Come on, dude, bring out the chainsaw. Let's do it. All right. I got the keys, and we're leaving in five minutes. Really immature, guys. Not cool. What is it? This little bitch. What did they do? Is it broken? He took my battery. What did he do with it? That little bitch. Chad! Chad! Chad, I'm gonna kill you! They're probably getting eaten by a bear right now. I'm bored. You want a beer? Do I look sexy? Yeah. Do I look sexy? Like this? No? You look pretty sexy. What do you want to do with that cigarette? Just put it in your mouth. You want me to light it? No. Where's the lighter? Give it to me. Give me the lighter. You can't light it inside the house. I can, too. I can, too. (LAUGHING) I'm a bad girl. (BOTH GRUNTING) Smack me again. No. Oh, God, I'm gonna spill beer. I'm pretty sure. Hold on. (BOTH LAUGHING) (BLOWING RASPBERRY) Let your neck go. I love you. Here. Nice feet. I just kissed you. Hold on. Matt. I gotta make sure your feet are dry. You're gonna get a cold. I'm feeling rejected. I promised Chad. Fine. I need my sunglasses back, then. (SIGHS) (TINKLING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) You suck! (LAUGHS) Shit. Where's Michelle? Fuck. MICHELLE: Catherine? Is that you guys? Whoa. You guys are back? What the hell just happened? CATHERINE: Nothing. What is going on? Nothing. We just... Nothing. Hey, Matt? This isn't good. We thought that we were going to catch you all in the act. Why would you think that we would be doing it? Well, we saw you making out in the living room. Hi. What are you doing out here? Just outside, breathing the air. Can I sit with you? Yeah, pull up a chair. (STAMMERING) I... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You were just having fun. I guess so. Really, it's no big deal. Really? You're okay? Yeah. Here, you want some trail mix? Yeah. (SCREAMS) (BOTH LAUGH) Sorry. That was mean. I'm sorry. But hilarious. Go ahead. Try again. No, now I'm going to be ready for it. Do you trust me? Yeah. Okay, go ahead. See, you can trust me. I can trust you? Yep. You know that you will be mine. (GIGGLES) Yeah? You're going to fall for me. It's inevitable. I almost feel sorry for you. CATHERINE: You're here with a bag over your head. CHAD: That's my favorite. I think that's just adorable. CATHERINE: That was cute. MICHELLE: I can't believe you guys were taking pictures. CHAD: Hey, Matt! CATHERINE: Here, he had the battery. It was so heavy. Come down here and have a drink with us. Yeah, come down. He'll keep talking to himself for hours up there. CATHERINE: He always does that. Matt! MATT: I'm working. Don't be anti-social. Come down. He's working? What is he working on? What are you working on? I'm working on the script. If any of you care to join me, you're more than welcome. If not, I'll do it myself. MICHELLE: Are we still making a movie? I'm sorry we busted you masturbating, dude. I didn't mean to laugh. I don't care about that. None of you take this seriously. You guys want to be extras for the rest of your life, go ahead. Be my guest. Matt, face it, we don't know what we're doing. Jesus, God. Chad, you know, that's such bullshit. You're gonna insult me about that now, after all this... (LOUD THUD) Shit! Get away from the window! MATT: Did you see that, Chad? Yes, I saw it! Come on, you guys. There's someone outside. I swear I saw it. CATHERINE: How many times do we have to do this? MATT: Shut up! CHAD: Michelle, there was someone outside. MATT: Shut up! (CATHERINE SCREAMS) Shut up! CATHERINE: My God! If one of you is playing a fucking trick, you better fess up right now! CATHERINE: Calm down, Matt. What the hell? Right now! I'm not. I saw him. MATT: Are you playing a joke? What? No. What are you doing? MATT: Chad? I saw him outside. There's someone outside. I'm going to go outside and bash his fucking head in. If it's one of your friends, you better tell me right now. No. You're... MATT: All right, that's it. I'm going out. CHAD: All right, I got your back. CATHERINE: Well, wait, don't leave us. CHAD: You all, come on. MICHELLE: I gotta get my shoes. CATHERINE: There's nothing out here. We're scaring each other. This is stupid. Will you shut the fuck up? (TINKLING) MICHELLE: Oh, my God. CATHERINE: What is that? That's him. That's him. Let's go back inside. MICHELLE: I agree. CATHERINE: Matt. No. Hey, man, what do you want? You're on private property. You better leave. We're gonna bash your fucking head in, man. You better go. No, I think we should just call... MICHELLE: I don't think you should do that. CHAD: He's not backing up. CATHERINE: Come on, let's go call the police. He's not backing up. I'm going to bash his fucking head in. If this is a joke, you guys have to tell me right now. Let's just go back inside, and call the police. We're gonna scare him off. Let's just scare him off. Okay, okay. I got your back. What? What are you... Let's just scare him off. No! I got your back. Thanks. Let's do it. One. Let's just go back inside. Two! MICHELLE: No, you guys. Don't do it. Three! CATHERINE: Matt! Chad! He's got a knife! (CATHERINE AND MICHELLE SCREAMING) MATT: Chad! Run! Run! Chad! Run! (SCREAMING CONTINUES) CATHERINE: Get inside, get inside! MICHELLE: Get in! MICHELLE: Lock the door. CATHERINE: I'm calling the police. MICHELLE: Get the other door! Get the windows. Make sure the windows are locked. Go! Go! Go! Make sure the windows are... (SOBBING) (SCREAMS) MATT: Who the fuck is that? I tried. The phone is fucking dead! Chad! CHAD: What, the phone's dead? The phone is dead. CHAD: Matt, what are we gonna do? Matt, what are we gonna do? I don't know. Matt! MICHELLE: Get away. Get away from there. Okay, all right. Come on, Matt. Get over here. Get over here, get over here! CHAD: (SHUSHING) All right. Okay. What was that? (CLATTERING) MATT: Is that the car? CHAD: Sounds like the car. Oh, my God. Is he fucking stealing the car? What are you doing? MATT: Chad, don't. MICHELLE: Chad. Chad. Chad. Shit. CATHERINE: What? CHAD: He fucked up the car. CHAD: Got it? MATT: Yeah. MICHELLE: Somebody's gotta help me get this. MATT: Get the white chair. How about that white chair? What are we gonna do? CATHERINE: Move this one. Just get it in the window, please, please. Hurry up. Come on. CATHERINE: Move the couch? Can you get out? Yeah, I got it. Fuck. What else? We gotta do something, because I'm gonna fall asleep. (TINKLING) (MICHELLE COUGHS) Okay. Is it safe? CHAD: I think so. Put your shoes on. CATHERINE: Ready? How far have we got to walk? CHAD: It's 11 miles. MICHELLE: To what? CHAD: To the highway. How much further do you think, Chad? I don't know. I thought we'd be there by now. I don't remember this. Matt, did we drive over this? We definitely didn't drive over this. No. No way. Fuck. MICHELLE: Should we turn around and go back? Hey, what's that? What? Right there. MATT: Right there. CHAD: What the... MATT: Holy shit. CATHERINE: Hey, can you see anything? Is anybody in there? I don't know. You guys, you can just walk on this road. Wait. We'll find out if someone's in there. Chad, you hot wire it? CHAD: I can try. CATHERINE: Why don't we wait and see if somebody's in it? I'm going to smash the window. MATT: Chad. Yeah? Walk away. Come here. MICHELLE: What's going on? MATT: (SHUSHING) Just walk away, Chad. CATHERINE: Run! Run! MATT: Come on! Come on, Chad! (CHAD PANTING) MATT: Chad! (MATT SCREAMING) No! No! No! Run! Run! MICHELLE: Oh, my God! Hey! BOTH: Hey! Hey! Hey! Help! Help! Help! Hey! Hey! Help! Please! Hey! Stop! (SCREAMING) Chad! Are you okay? Chad! Oh, my God, Chad! Chad. Oh, my God. CATHERINE: Chad, are you okay? (SOBBING) We gotta roll him over. Yeah. Be careful. Be careful. Watch his back. Watch his back. He's gonna scream. MICHELLE: Chad. Chad. CATHERINE: Please be careful with him. (MICHELLE AND CATHERINE SCREAMING) CATHERINE: Get the fuck away from us! Get the fuck out of here! Don't you touch us! Don't you touch us! Matt, get over here. CATHERINE: Get the fuck away from us! It's okay. It's okay. It was a joke. Is he all right? CATHERINE: Don't you touch us! It's okay! Don't touch him! Get the fuck away from us. No, it's okay. It's me, Jett Garner. This wasn't supposed to happen. Matt? MATT: Look at me. Look at me, Chad. We gotta move him. We gotta get him to a hospital now. We need to brace his head. MATT: Grab his feet. Grab his feet. Be careful with him. (MICHELLE SOBBING) MATT: Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. CATHERINE: Fuck. Watch his head. Watch his head. CATHERINE: Careful. Careful. Careful. I got him. I got him. He's okay. Be careful with his neck. MATT: I got him, I got him. Bring him back. Shit. Fuck. Don't go. Hold on. Okay. Go. Hey. How are you feeling? You got hit by... There was a car. You broke your leg. Matt's dead. CATHERINE: No. Huh? He's fine. He... He tricked us. Do you remember when he was upstairs working on the script? Well, he called that filmmaker guy and told him to come over and scare us. They staged the whole thing. They filmed it. Jett Garner was wearing one of those miniature cameras on his clothes. I saw him get stabbed. That was fake. It was all fake. Where's Matt? He's outside. Go get him. (DOOR OPENING) How you doing? Shitty. I'm so sorry. I didn't want this to happen. This is not what I planned to happen. I want to see the footage. Dude, I don't give a shit about the footage. I can get rid of the footage. I'm the one in a hospital bed right now. I get whatever the fuck I want. Let me see the footage. (EXHALES) (BEEPS) (CAMCORDER PLAYING) (MICHELLE AND CATHERINE SCREAMING) MATT ON TAPE: Run! Chad! Run! MICHELLE ON TAPE: Chad, run! Jesus Christ. (MICHELLE SCREAMING ON TAPE) MATT: Chad, run! Come on, Chad! (LAUGHING) Oh, my God. My fucking face! Oh, Jesus. You are sick, man. This footage is amazing. Well, I mean, fuck it... No, no, no, no. We take this. We get it edited. We enter it into film festivals, and that's it. That's history. I didn't want you to get hurt, you know? Of course you didn't. I wish it was me that got hurt. I wish I got hit by the car. I didn't want that to happen. I know you didn't want me to get hurt. You sure? Yeah. It was an accident. Of course you didn't, man. I mean, it would... It was my fault, you know. It's all good now, dude. It's all good. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry. Catherine? (DOOR CLOSING) MATT: I thought you were dead. I thought you were dead. God. I thought you were dead. (CRYING) I'm such a fucking idiot. You are an idiot, but it's okay. Now go get me some ice cream. (SNIFFLING) What flavor do you want? I don't want bullshit ice cream. I want Haagen-Dazs. (LAUGHS) I love you, man. I love you, too. (SIGHS HEAVILY) How are you doing? I would have let it rip. I would have gone all out if I had been in your position. He was already beating himself up so much. I didn't have it in me to torture him anymore. Thanks for being here for me. Thanks for letting me be here. I'm glad you woke up. I'm a little tired. Well, why don't you rest your head right here? I'll put it right here. Yeah, scoot up. Here we go. I'll just go like this. Good night, movie girlfriend. Good night.
