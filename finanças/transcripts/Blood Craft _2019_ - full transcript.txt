Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Do not be deceived. Neither fornicator, nor adulterer, nor thief, nor effeminate, nor homosexual, nor drunkard. Swindlers, swindlers! No! No one shall inherit the kingdom of the God without going through our lord, Jesus Christ, and the salvation and the grace, which he put himself on the cross, in pain, in blood, for us, for our flesh, for our sins! We are who he died for! Amen. Donate your conscience, cleanse your soul. Thank you, Father, God bless you. Bless you, Meredith. Father, you're an inspiration. I know, son. Donate your conscience, bless your soul. Donate your conscience, cleanse your soul. He's gone. He's dead. You'll be in room number three tonight, love. Hi. Yeah. Did your daddy ever tell you you're a fucking whore? Let me see your ass. Spread your cheeks. Wider. Yeah, spread that shit open. What do you wanna see her do, man? She'll do anything. Touch your pussy, baby. Come on. Oh fuck. My friend's getting married next week. 50 bucks, you let him fuck you in your ass. Okay, take your shoe off, stick the heel in your ass. Let me put this out on your back. I want you to take the belt and choke yourself with it. Just take it and do it already! Spare some change? Hello, Charles. Hi. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Have a good night. You're an angel. Dear Grace, I am writing to inform you of the passing of your father, Matthew Hall. This is an official notification of death from the County Clerk's Office. Should you wish to give our receptionist a call and schedule and appointment, our hours run from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., Monday through Friday. I apologize for contacting you under these circumstances. Please reach out to us at your earliest convenience. Best, Tyler Waters, County Clerk's Office. Doesn't it smell pretty? Mom, she broke my flower. Grace. Which flower do you like best? Which speaks to you the most? That one. Pick it. Now you pull off the stem. Why'd you have me do that? It broke. Flowers break when they're apart. But together, they are strong. And you must remember that, both of you together, you are strong. Yes, Mother. Yes, Mother. You're here. Serena. Where did you go? Why did you leave? What do you mean? Where did you go? You just ran away without even saying a word to me. You didn't even try to take me with you. He told me you were gone. I looked everywhere for you. You just vanished. He lied. He lied to both of us. He told you I ran away so you would leave. I stayed as long as I could. I'm so sorry. Where have you been? I've been okay. You get it. No one knows I'm here, and I don't wanna face anyone. Hello? Can I help you? Grace, wow. I saw a car out front, I figured I'd take a chance to stop in. I've been trying to track you down. You're the next of kin and, well, there's no will. Tyler, from the County Clerk's Office. Of course, sorry. Come in, please. Thank you. Yeah, I personally wanted to let you know about the passing of your father. Thank you, I appreciate that. Have a seat, please. Thank you. Can I offer you some tea or some water? Thank you, darling, a glass of water would be fine. Here you go. Thank you. So look, the place needs some pretty extensive work, obviously, and being by the highway doesn't exactly help, but given the amount of land, I'm sure we could work out something reasonable, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands for you. It's hard times for everybody right now. Your letter made it seem like you were writing me out of compassion. Whoa, hold up, hold on. Yes, I wanted to let you know, of course. And I figured you'd want the estate settled, and I'm offering to help you with that. This isn't the time for me to be thinking about this. I'm just trying to come to terms with everything that's happened. Okay. Look, let's just not be too hasty here, okay? Maybe we just need to get reacquainted a bit better, that's all. I want you to leave now. Oh, Grace. You don't really remember me, do you? I remember. Yes, thank you. Come then, you shall see the apartment I told you you could occupy. It'll suit you to a marvel. Out of the way... What do you think you're doing? What do you mean, what's wrong? Knock it off, Tyler. Tyler, please, just go. Just leave. Now look. I have been trying to track you down for weeks. I wanted to bury your piece of shit father in an unmarked grave, but I am trying to help you. So you can move on with your life. Lord knows you've been running from him forever, Grace, this is not somewhere you're gonna wanna be. You don't wanna remember. Please, just go now, please. For when you reconsider things. Why didn't you help me? Nevermind, he's gone. Do you think we should sell the house? Listen, you just got home, so let's not think about it right now. Maybe it'd be better if we got a fresh start. This is our fresh start. We don't have to be afraid anymore of drunken tirades or the sound of his leather belt. Stop. It got so much worse after Mom died. Stop, stop. The welts and the bruises. No, please, stop, stop. Everything he did to us, it would hurt so badly. Grace, do you want me to show you the welts and bruises? Then you'll cry for mercy, too. Serena? What happened? You're all grown up now, aren't you, Grace? I missed you. You're awake, sleeping beauty. What happened? How long have I been out? A couple hours. Is that Mom's witchcraft stuff? Where did you find her spell book? In the secret hiding spot. Remember Mom teaching us out in the garden? Mom. It's not moving. Here. Hold your sister's hand. I'm scared. My sweet, nothing will happen to you as long as I'm around. Promise? Yes, I promise. What if you aren't here? Then your sister will be. Mom, is it dead? Nothing is ever gone for good. Nothing is ever gone for good. Hilde? Hilde, we're here, honey. We're here, Hilde. Take care of the girls. Don't leave me, Hilde. You can't leave me alone. You're stronger together. Hilde. Come on, Hilde. No. No. No, no, no, no! No! No. No. No, no, no. Please, no. Don't do this. Go to your room now. Are you fucking deaf? Get out! Get out, get out, get out of my sight! Get out of my sight, get out of my sight. Father told you I ran away so you would leave. So you wouldn't find out. So no one would find out. That I had missed three periods. How did you keep that a secret from me? I didn't even know you had a boyfriend. I hid it well. Father got what he deserved. Dying slowly, wasting away, the alcohol rotting him from the inside out. What happened to the baby? He's in a better place now, far away from here. What happened? I'll tell you about it another time. He just didn't know how to deal with losing Mom. I tried to be there for you and be like she was for you, but he couldn't cope. The only way he knew how was the drinking. Grace, he punched me in the face when I was six years old. You had to hold a bag of frozen peas over my eyes because they were bruised all over. You remember that one time he dragged me up the stairs by my arm? I remember. I need your help to torture his soul. Serena, he left this life as a tortured soul. Grace, I need you to think long and hard. We used to lay in bed at night, grasping each other's hands. We'd chant in our heads. And we would fly up, up above our bodies, into the sky. We'd hold each other's hands and fly over the trees, and to the moon. And you would just lay there. I don't wanna remember! Nothing happened, it didn't happen, it didn't happen. Even if you can't remember, or don't wanna believe that it happened to you, just know that he hurt me very badly. It was just touching, it was just touching, or he would just touch himself. What he did to us was not okay. He's buried right out back. You can say your peace to him without being afraid. You can yell at him, you can tell him how you really feel. I wish I'd come back when he was still alive, so I could make him feel all the pain that he made you feel. We can bring him back. We can make him pay. Bring him back? How? When night falls dark and all goes black, we chant our spell, and bring what's gone back. Bring what's gone back. A soul so vile, wretched and wrong, we curse it back through this song. Never to rest, longing for sleep, from the depths of the earth, clinging to grief. Where is he? Right there. It's okay. Now what? Well, now we need to intone a resurrection spell, bring his soul back into his body, and make him pay. Can we really, can we really do this? This isn't exactly a cute little mouse we're dealing with here. We're dealing with pure evil. We're gonna need a spell book, more candles, a chalice, and an athame. Agreed. But first things first, we need some incense, 'cause the smell is awful. Yeah, I think there's some in this drawer. I'll go get everything we need. And a razor! Don't forget a razor. Here you go. All these candles remind me of when Father didn't pay the power bill. I remember that time. They got in a huge argument. When he hadn't paid the bill. He punched her in the face and gave her a black eye. Do you remember, we were all just huddled with Mom in the bathroom? She was just holding us in the bathtub. He was banging down the door. It's okay, it's okay. Hilde, open the door now! Open the fucking god damn door now! Open the door, open the door! Honey. Come on, it was an accident. That was an accident. That's just one more reason we're gonna make him pay for what he did to us. I wish we could bring her back, erase all the suffering she went through. She'll be vindicated when we make him suffer. We need to draw a pentacle and place him in the center of it. Yes, but it has to be drawn with a mixture of blood and tears. The ritual is most effective using the fluids of the firstborn sister. Well that would be me. Goddesses of the dark arts, we implore you to bless this cathartic enterprise, so that we may have peace and be freed from the pain that would otherwise lead to our own souls' demise. With firstborn's red blood and tears fresh from eyes, we beseech thee to empower this potion derived. Blood gathered at new cycle start, shedding anew and tears crystal clear as morning's fresh dew. We call forth the power of air. We call forth the power of earth. We call forth the power of water. We call forth the power of fire. We beseech thee, oh mystical elements, on this night, and harness your power, your darkness, your light. Now night's fallen dark and all has gone black, we chant our spell and bring what's gone back. A soul so vile, wretched and wrong, we curse thee back through this song. Never to rest, longing for sleep, from the depths of the earth, clinging to grief. We conjure your soul, return from the dead, with the plunge of this knife, our words in their stead. Make it stop! Put it back, put it back! We can't, we can't, I can't find any spell to trap his soul back into his body. There has to be something. We can try forcing his soul back into his body, but we risk losing him forever. We don't have any choice! No, I'm not losing my only chance of making him pay for what he did to us. You have to put him back, put him back! Okay, there's a binding spell. We could trap his spirit into another vessel. Other body, Serena, we don't have that! No, just any kind of object. I don't know, just a doll, go get a doll! Please do it, do it now! We send you back, not from whence you came, to be trapped inanimate. Soul so dark, without beating heart. Your powers dwindling, until our magic tears you apart. We curse you now to be trapped within, unable to escape, wreak havoc, your sin. We curse you now to be trapped within, unable to escape, wreak havoc, your sin! Now what? I don't know. We figure out a way to put his soul back into another person's body. Oh great, I'll just go round up another body and we'll be good to go. Yeah, that didn't exactly go as planned. Maybe we could do a variation of the spell and make it work. The book specifically said that the spell could only be used once with the same body. I'm exhausted. Let's try to figure this out in the morning, there's nothing else we can possibly do tonight. Serena, lift up your sister's dress. Are you dumb, girl? Huh? When I tell you to do something, you do it. Lift up your sister's dress. Don't leave me, Hilde. You're stronger together. I never come in here. I don't know why you would want to. I don't know. I guess I just wanted to see if everything was the same, and it is. Everything is exactly the way I remembered it. That was Mother's favorite dress. She was only 18 when she married Dad. She was always so beautiful. She was. You look a lot like her. I do, don't I? Serena, I'm sorry. For the touching, for the things that Father made me do to you. We both had to do things to each other. It was a matter of survival. He made me do things to you, too, remember? I don't really wanna remember. I keep getting flashes of memories, but... I remember it quite well. Every little detail. I think it's better to just keep it locked in the past. I'm glad I remember it. It wasn't all so bad. Even bad times ended up being okay. Ended up being okay? Sometimes you would touch me, and it felt good. I think you liked it, too. I mean, not the way Father did it. But the way we did things to each other. And you really liked it when I would kiss you softly, like this. And I really liked it when you would do this to me. Serena, lift up your sister's dress. Drunk before dinner again, huh? No, no, sir. Why don't you just cut the shit? This is why you still live at home. You're an embarrassment! You've been around the Hall house, haven't you? Haven't you? I'm sorry, sir, I just wanted to see her. Oh yeah? And how'd that work out for you? You told her about the money, didn't you? No, sir. I told you not to fucking go over there! I had to for my job. No, you disobeyed a direct order! Dad, please. No, please nothing. What did I tell you about respect, boy? Respect is received when it's earned. You not listening to me when I tell you something isn't respecting me, is it? No. What was that? No, sir. You stay away from that house. I don't wanna tell you that ever again. Ever! What are you drawing? You. Have you eaten any of those mushrooms? No, not yet, why? Because I think they're the magical kind. Thanks for the warning. You're welcome. There's a whole other bowl of those downstairs. Act natural. Pretend I'm not here. Okay. You know, I have stacks of pictures that I've drawn of you over the years. You do? Can I see them? You can see them when I'm done. Stop moving. It feels like we've never been apart. It does. All I've ever wanted was for us to be together. Together. We're together now. What was that? Maybe the spell worked, and it's Father. I think somebody's downstairs. Don't move from this spot. Where is it? Serena. Ow! Tyler. Holy shit. Well, looks like we found our body. No, we can't use him. Of course we can, and we will. I thought we needed a corpse. No, he'll do. Serena, we can't. Don't you wanna get back at this asshole? I do, I do, but... Remember all that anger you had the other night? Remember that? What happened? Look at it. Look at it! You know, they're all the fucking same, just taking advantage of all the women. All of them, just all the fucking same. You don't know that. Why the fuck do you think he's here? Really, why the fuck do you think he's here? So what am I supposed to do with him? I don't know, teach him a lesson. And then we can put Father's soul into his body. Yes. Give him some of those mushrooms, it'll be easy for you to manage him. What the fuck? Did you really think that you could just break into my house? What the fuck is that? What is that, blood? Oh god, okay. Okay. I don't know what the hell this is, but my father, my father's gonna be looking for me. And he knows I've been hanging around here, so you just tell me where the money is, and I'll leave. Your father knows that you broke into my home? What are you talking about, there's no money here. Don't play stupid, Grace. The money, the money your father stole from the parish. There's a lot of it, and I'm gonna find it. If my father had stashed any money here, why would I let you just take it? I'm gonna get my hands on that money, one way or another. No, no, please, please, you can't do this. Sure I can't. You broke into my home. I wasn't gonna do anything, okay? I just wanted to scare you a little and get the money, because I have to get away from him. I have to get, I have to get... Slave! I'm inside life! Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler! Sunflowers. Pink type. Did you find the spell? It looks like our spell boy has turned into sleeping beauty. Out like a light, huh? Do you think it's true, what he said about the money? I don't know. I remember kids talking about it, but I never believed them. Now for the hard part. Are you ready for this? Are you prepared to do what needs to be done? I know we won't have any peace until we do this. Do you think it'll hurt him? Once Father is inside of him, Tyler won't feel a thing. He won't have any recollection of it, either. And then we can ask Father where the money is. But before we put his spirit into this body, will he be aware of what's happening? I'm sure there'll be some pain, but we have to do it. Are you prepared to restrain him? Yes. I can see that it's necessary. Once you have him secure, we'll start. You don't think there's a chance it could kill him, do you? I don't know. I don't think so. But does it matter? We have to do this. Is this really the only way? Grace, Father made us eat our own vomit. Do you understand, we would lay in bed at night with so much anxiety for what he did to us? Help me. Are you really gonna make me do all this by myself? Don't you wanna help me? You're the firstborn, remember? And besides, I'll need to translate the spell and guide you. I wanna make up for the times I didn't protect you. It's not your fault. You need to do this. We need to do this. I really hope this works. Me too. Then we'll finally be free from this misery. Okay, get the feet. Let's begin. Tyler. I'm sorry, son. We need to incorporate the powers of air, earth, water, and fire, along with blood and semen. My monthly blood and his seed are in the chalice. Good. With firstborn's red blood and tears fresh from eyes, we beseech thee to empower this potion derived. Blood gathered at cycle start, shedding anew. This is actually gonna work this time, isn't it? Yes, we're putting an old soul into a new body. We call forth the power of air. We call forth the power of air. We call forth the power of blood and life. We call forth the power of blood and life. We call forth the power of earth. We call forth the power of earth. We call forth the power of water. We call forth the power of water. We call forth the power of fire. We call forth the power of fire. We cleanse this living soul to lie dormant and restrained, as we replace it with another's. A soul now lying in wait. You are purified of remnants of earthly consciousness. For the remainder of the penance we inflict on your body's new tenant, we relegate your soul to the dark recesses in between both light and dark, to keep it safe until it can be seen. We call forth the goddesses of the dark arts, with all of the longing deep in our hearts. Release you from binding, to live in new skin. Release you from binding, to live in new skin. Release you from binding, to live in new skin. Release you from binding, to live in new skin. Release you from binding, to live in new skin. Well hello, girls. Grace. It's been a very long time. Not nearly long enough. What's the matter? Were you afraid to come back? That's not very nice, Grace! Is that any way to treat your father? You were a poor excuse for a father. Didn't I provide for you? Clothe you, feed you, I put a roof over your head. You hurt us! You hurt us all! You abused us! How does that feel, hm? How does it feel to be completely helpless and subjected to pain? God, you were always so ungrateful! I gave you discipline. I took care of you after your mother died. I wouldn't call what you did taking care of us. God damn it! He's healing? He can feel it, but it's not showing any marks. Serena. There she is, my sweet, perfect little girl. Don't you dare talk to her as if you were some loving, virtuous parental figure! That's it, Grace, make him understand. I did the best I could with you girls. I raised you with a firm hand, the way my father did with me. Shut up! I don't understand how there's no mark. There's nothing. He can feel it, but it's showing up on the corpse, not Tyler. What? Oh my god. There is no god. I spent my whole life serving God, just to find out he doesn't exist. Of course he doesn't. Because no god would have ever allowed you to do the things that you did to our mother and us. If there was a god, he would cast you into Hell for desecrating my corpse! The only person that deserves to rot in hell is you. Good thing you don't believe in God anymore, because I sure as hell don't! Grace, please. Let's just say that if the god that I raised you to believe in did exist, he would tell you to turn the other cheek, right? Wouldn't he? What was it you always liked to say to us? Spare the rod, spoil the child? Because you're a miserable piece of shit. Please, please. You have a chance to show me mercy. Like I never showed you. Like my father never showed me. Do you really think because your father abused you, that gives you any excuse for what you did to us? You never showed us any mercy. You never heard our cries to stop! I'm sorry, I can't hear you. What the fuck did you just say? That was for what you did to our mother. Please, I was a sick man. I have a disease. It was the alcohol. The alcohol. Yeah, I remember. The alcohol. I remember the smell of alcohol on your breath as you hovered over us. Hovering over you and what? Don't you dare laugh! Show him the scars. Scars? The scars on your stomach from cutting yourself. How do you know about that? I just know, Grace. Show him. It was the only way that I could deal with the pain, and feel like I was still alive. I raised you with discipline so you'd grow up to be strong, it's not my fault you're weak. It's not your fault she's weak? You used your daughters for your own sick pleasure, you sick son of a bitch. Do you even care? About how hard my life has been after I left here? Do you wanna hear about a hard life? How about your wife dying, leaving you alone with an unbearable loneliness. She was our mother. She left us all alone. And we had to stay here alone with you, you monster. I had to cater to the sexual whims of men, just to survive, because it was the only way that I could make enough money to pay for the psychiatrists and the hospitalizations. I have needed a lot of help to deal with everything that you put me through. You see? Weak. Weak. Nothing has been as satisfying as this. Tell him about the medical bills. From your problem. I don't wanna talk about that. You could really use the stash of money he stole. Is it true? About the money? You wanna know about the money? About the money, where I hid it? It's with your mother. In a small wooden box, buried in her grave. Yeah, I took it. I took it. To help her, so I could get her out of that toxic factory. But she got sick anyway, so I took more and more, to pay for her treatments, but nothing worked. And you wanna know how much is left, after all that? One dollar. One measly little dollar, buried with her. So you can go ahead and take that worthless, pathetic little dollar, you ungrateful little whore! He raped you. You need to face the facts. No. No, he didn't. It never went that far, it was, it was just touching. It was... Then why can't you have children? It's just a medical condition that I have! Snap out of it, Grace! It's just a medical condition that I have. You going to tell her about the baby, or should I? Serena. Hey, Serena! I did you a favor. I saved you from having to raise a little brat at such a young age. This is madness, I can't believe what I'm hearing. He raped me, it was his baby! I'm so sorry. He got rid of the problem. He killed the baby. Just a minute! Hello? Good morning there, Miss. I'm Sheriff Waters, you mind if I come in? It's kind of a mess in here. I just need to ask you a couple questions, that's all. How can I help you, Sheriff? My condolences, Grace. I was aware of your father's passing, and I sent the coroner out here. My son, he helped arranged to bury him here, next to your mom. Thank you, Sheriff Waters. Well, like I said, it was my son. I believe he wrote you about taking care of your estate. I told him that I haven't made any decision yet. When was that? A few days ago. A little off-topic here, you didn't happen to see a small wooden box around here, did you? I looked around here after your father passed, and I didn't see it at all. It's official police business. I'm sorry, I haven't seen any kind of a box like that around here. If you'll excuse me, I really need to get back to sorting through... Alright, alright. Thank you for your time. But if you happen to see that box, you will let me know, right? Will do. Good to see you, Grace. You too. Serena. He's going to come back. What do we do? We need to finish what we started now. Yes, let's finish it and move on. Are you not happy yet? I don't think I can ever make you suffer enough for what you've done. Just send me back already. I can't. Not until you grasp the gravity of what you've done. You don't seem to grasp the level of pain I was in, and what was done to me. There is so much you don't know. You know, you never met your grandfather, because he shot himself in the head before you were born. But if you had, you'd know, however bad you think I was, he was far worse. He was a cocksucker. Are you gonna try to justify what you did with your sob story? After hearing what you did to Serena and an innocent baby, do you really think there's anything you can say to me to make me have an ounce of sympathy for you? Am I going to tell her what happened, or are you? No, don't, Serena. Please. Why tell her, just let her believe the way things are. Are you growing soft on me now? Or are you just too chickenshit to tell her? Tell me what? Serena, don't! Shut up! Shut up! It's time. Please, just release my soul, please. I can't be here for this. I can't. No, you coward. You're gonna face the consequences of your biggest sin. Your baby, your secret! I had two secrets. I only told you one. Tell me. There's nothing more you can do to me, please. Please just release me. Tell her! She already knows. She's always known. She just hasn't been able to face it. But you're here with me. I've always been with you. I never left your side. How could that be? Are you real? I'm real to you in your heart. You carry me with you. I don't understand. He told me you were gone. I looked everywhere for you. You just vanished. When drawn is the magical circle. By sword or athame or power. His compass between the two worlds lies. Serena, I'm sorry for the things that Father made me do to you. Serena. I don't even know what's real. What are you? I'm whatever you want me to be. You won't leave me, will you? We can be together forever. How? If you eat all the mushrooms. Serena? Serena! Don't leave me! You killed her! You raped her and you killed her baby! You killed her! You killed her! I cast out your soul for evermore. Not to calm and peace. I cast it into the shadows, you shall never know peace. You shall grow low in the shadows, knowing only dark. Hate and sadness for evermore will permeate your heart. Hate and sadness for evermore will permeate your heart. Hate and sadness for evermore will permeate your heart. Grace. What happened? I'll get you some water. Where are my clothes? Whoa, what the... Damn it, not again. Is this where my mommy is? I miss my mommy. Hey, hey, hush now, okay? Don't worry, I'll take care of you. I wanna go home. You said you were gonna take me to my mom. Why don't you just stay in the car? I'm sure I can fix this. We're not gonna let him get away with that, now are we? No, we most certainly are not. Okay. Yeah. Now look, you've been a very good little boy so far. Alright? Now, if you keep being a very good little boy, maybe you'll get a treat. Ice cream? We can get some ice cream, or maybe a sucker. A sucker? But it's very important that you do everything I say. Everything, and then you'll get your treat. I can get a treat? Oh, you'll get a treat, alright. Oh yeah. Together. Forever.
