Subtitling made possible by Acorn Media "Upstairs Downstairs"... That brings back a few memories. It was a few years ago since I did this, looking through "Punch" magazines for illustrations to put on the captions. John Hawkesworth said, "Sandy, we're doing this Edwardian series and wondering if you'd like to submit a tune." Got to get people out of the loo and say, "Oh, that... My God. Quick. I've got to get to 'Upstairs Downstairs."' I liked the word "submit" because it means that they don't mean that they actually are going to give you the job until they hear what you suggest. Then take me a photograph of the picture or a negative of the picture and masking out the areas that we're not gonna use. And then we'd have produced a white print. And I wrote one tune overnight, and they said, "Could it be a little bit more like Elgar and not so much like Eric Coates?" He would take the white paper and dye it to the green that we wanted to maintain through the series. Sitting at this piano, on this very stool, I quickly found that it sounded rather nice in a waltz version. So, Rosemary Guest would come along and put in the lettering for the caption. On the day of the recording, when the music started... It was the music that the nerves started. "Dee da-da dum da-dee" would set our pulses going in. It was like a first night in a play. And you'd hear the station ident. LWT would come up from the screen. "Hush, studio. Quiet. We're going for a recording." "Upstairs Downstairs," part 1, production number 1502, recording date 20/6/72, take one. I was absolutely thrilled to be asked to write the first script of the new series, which, of course, followed on to the last one. There's rather an odd anomaly that happened with the dating of some of those early episodes. They used to put the date... Like 1908, 1909, whatever... Down at the bottom of the screen in the beginning of the episode. Lawrence and Elizabeth got married in 1909. I've got a feeling that the second series actually started a year... Yes, the first series ended in 1909. And the second series started in 1908. And it was to do with the king's visit. But they also realized that Edward VII was gonna be dead six months later. So, at the beginning of the second series, they got rid of the dates on the bottom of the screen and decided arbitrarily that they'd push everything back a year. We found ourselves trapped by history. We couldn't get out of it. So, the second series started in 1908. Yes. And Nicola Pagett and Ian Ogilvy came back from their honeymoon a year early. Before they got married. And it was all locked in history... The whole series was... And therefore, we couldn't really move out of the historical limits of what was happening. Do you think you're gonna miss us, Rose, when you go down to Greenwich, eh? - Whee! - Ow! You made me spill it! I tell you, Edward, if I miss you, it'll be a good miss. I bet you have some laughs out there. I hope Rose will have no such thing. Elizabeth was married to Lawrence. And I felt... Rose felt... I felt and Rose felt that we were being demoted because we weren't going to be in 165 Eaton Place. And I thought, "I know they can't actually write me out because it's in my..." Ideas, you know. Contract. But I got a bit worried. It was a bit like... In this series, if you ever went to Southwold, where Lady Marjorie's mother lived, you thought, "Am I being written out, and when am I coming back?" You see, we went into this big shop in the... something-strasse. - The Something-Strasse. - Yes. Well, they were selling hand-carved boxes and things at enormous prices. And I went to the back of the shop, and there was this little man, working away in a dreadfully bad light, carving them. So I told Lawrence to hold the owner of the shop - in conversation... - Yes. That wasn't easy. He wasn't interested in politics, and the only poet he'd ever heard of was Byron. Well, anyway, Lawrence managed to keep him out of the way while I asked the old man if he hadn't something of his own to sell. And he brought out this. So I was able to buy it from him direct without any horrid middleman taking the profit. That's cheating the unfortunate shopkeeper who was paying the rent and taxes and making sure the old man didn't starve. Never mind. It was a blow against sweated labor. And I know Henrietta will approve. Darling, you haven't changed a bit. Haven't I, Mother? The whole story line was very interesting because there were thoughts about their marriage. It was clearly not consummated. And then the second series started and I went in and I said, "So," you know, "what's the story line?" They went, "Oh, you're going. That's it. We don't want you anymore." I went, "Oh, really?" And then they explained to me what happened to this character. And I went, "Oh, well, all right. Okay. Seems a pity, really, but never mind." It's very interesting about Lawrence because it was so... Because I had started it so much in Rupert Brooke, nobody ever knew whether Rupert Brooke was a homosexual. Nobody ever knew, really, just that he did have a lot of trouble with love. But the way it was explained to me at the beginning of the second series did sound to me a little bit like it was an afterthought. And of course, it was quite a clever one, that idea that Lawrence could not... Or was unwilling to consummate his marriage, that the whole thing was in his head, that he was just an over-romantic, sentimental idiot, really. He builds around himself an alternative to that reality, which is the idea of a romantic poet whose mind is not of this world, and Rupert Brooke is a perfect sort of echo of it. What about you and Evelyn Larkin? That was not as you imagine, and I prefer not to compare you with Evelyn. Why not? Because a pure woman is not supposed to care about such... such... So, neither of our mothers is a pure woman. Oh, now, please, don't try to be clever. We've no way of knowing what our mothers may or may not have felt, and I, for one, prefer not to contemplate anything so bizarre. He was just this curious, poetic, not really wanting to get involved, just loving the idea of love. I think it's more interesting, in a way, that he wasn't gay. He was merely completely and absolutely disgusted by the whole concept of sex of any kind, with anybody. There are people like that. They are rare, but there are people like that, and I think that makes him a more interesting character. I mean, not everyone's passionate. Not everyone's that interested in sex. I mean, look at Boy George... "I'd rather have a cup of tea." And I didn't think that any of the men quite understood this poetic... This loving love, but not really wanting sex. And I always felt I understood it and nobody else did. I think in those days, somebody like Lawrence could really genuinely fool himself, and he had somewhere to go. I think, primarily, he's homosexual. And I always said, no, he wasn't. He was, in fact, just asexual. He had not a trace of sexuality about him at all. And I think, even when you see him in the earlier episodes or earlier scenes, when he's apparently having an affair with the character that Georgia Brown played, I don't think that's true at all. I think they were just sort of being Bohemian in sharing a bed. I think that was about it, really. Could it possibly be that any man who was straight would not be interested in Miss Elizabeth, in Nicola Pagett? I once told the story of my involvement in "Upstairs Downstairs" to an American actor, who said, "If that had been an American series, that story line would have lasted four years." He said, "You'd have got four years out of that situation." I said, "Well, we get on with it a bit in England." Anyway, I believe it not absolutely essential to have babies at first if we... If one is careful. Oh, God, Elizabeth! Not at breakfast. You won't talk about it in bed. I wish you'd see a doctor. - Whatever for? - You seem to be out of sorts. What a stunning observation. Elizabeth, I do detest sarcasm. And I detest being relegated to the position of a decorative doll. Nicola was absolutely enchanting as Elizabeth. And I think she... It's a very difficult part to play. I think the rebellious daughter of the house could become a great clich√©. I had a lovely part 'cause I just had to fight my parents all the time. So, you didn't think, "Oh, what a tiresome girl," because she was funny and touching. Beautiful performance. Nicola played it on a very high level of... As she got more and more frustrated and angry, she took it out on Rose. And she was always snarling at me. Don't cry, Miss Lizzie. Please don't cry. It's not as bad as you think. You've got it all out of proportion. - Don't you tell me, Rose! - Miss Lizzie. And don't call me Miss Lizzie. I'm a married woman. Married, which is more than you'll ever be! - What? - At least I've tried. I've offered myself, but you, you've never offered yourself to anyone, - so how can you give me advice? - I wasn't trying to. You and Thomas... You think I didn't hear you late at night? Teasing him and then stopping. Let me tell you, Rose, that unless you're prepared to give yourself utterly and risk making a fool of yourself, you'll never get anything in life! You'll end up withered here inside. I mean, look at you already! At least I'll never end up like you. But I loved all that rebellion stuff. I mean, it's a classic... It's almost like a sort of jewel of an example 'cause it's in-built... Writing's about conflict. And you had so many ways of doing the conflict... Up against up... You still haven't told me who the Anstees are. They're the most important people in the literary world today. Good. Then I should like to meet them. I don't think they'd amuse you. I don't always need to be amused! Down against down... You'll be waiting outside for the dirty dishes. Oh, no, I won't. I'll be serving. Up and down... How dare you... Dare you behave like that! I won't have it in my kitchen! I won't! You can take a week's notice! Both of you! John Alderton played my valet, and he was just brilliant in the part, so much so that he completely eclipsed me. I remember one reviewer saying, "Poor old Ian Ogilvy. He's just being acted off the wall by John Alderton." In my defense, I would say that, actually, John Alderton's part was a bit better than mine. Mine was just a vapid, squeaky little idiot, really, and John was this wonderfully strong character. And John was always a very strong actor and a terrific character actor, as well. I cannot... I cannot see her in that light. I love and respect her far too much. You have befriended me. Um... could you... Befriend her? It was a very bizarre, strange scene, and of course Charles Gray is a very bizarre, interesting man, with that gravelly voice and things. And I always thought it was a slightly creepy, rather... Rather unsettling scene, really, where a man proposes that another man should seduce his own wife. It was kind of interesting for its time, I think, that scene. Elizabeth, don't you sometimes think, in the half light... How could you guess? Ah. What an exquisite dream for an exquisite dreamer. And then I got seduced by Charles Gray, which was divine, 'cause I was drunk. I like doing drunk acting. You said the marriage had not been consummated. That's true. It hadn't. Are you saying that Lawrence is not the father of the child you're carrying? Yes. Lucy Elizabeth. The full name? I think just Lucy. Read it out again. "Kirbridge, on the 17th inst. At the Hallam nursing home, to Elizabeth, the wife of Lawrence Arthur Kirbridge, a daughter, Lucy." John come up and said, "We're going to do another series. Would you like to write for it?" And we said, "Well, we'd love to, but we've got a rather full plate." And he, very sweetly, said, "Well, look... whenever and whatever you want to write, just pick up the phone and let me know." So we rang him one day and said, "We've got an idea and we think we've... We've finished writing the first series, you know, honestly, and this is the play we'd like to write." He said, "Done," which was lovely. And we did. And we wrote "Out of the Everywhere." I enjoyed every minute of it. It was a super episode. And it sort of was my christening, as it were, of "Upstairs Downstairs." Uh, Nanny Webster will be arriving on Friday. That doesn't give you much notice, I'm afraid, but we thought she ought to settle in before Mrs. Kirbridge comes home with the baby. You all know each other. It won't be like a new nanny coming. She met Sarah, too, down at Southwold, so... Something troubling you, Hudson? Oh, no, my lady, it's, uh... It's just that I thought perhaps Nanny Webster had retired. - You mean you hoped she had. - I beg your pardon, sir? We'd had our first baby, and we'd had a monthly nurse who came to work for us to help with the baby and so on and so on. And to our horror one night, we went into the bedroom where the cot was, and the child was in bed with this enormous nanny, who was a very large woman about to roll over, and we thought this was terrifying. I think that the Bradys picked that up. We told them... I think I mentioned to them this awful experience we'd had with this monthly nurse. And one of them said, "Oh, yes, I think that would make a very good story. Can we use it?" But in this particular episode, you know, it was about something which is very touching, about a nanny who comes back to sort of take charge of this family baby in the normal way and then it's discovered that she... Going blind. That she's going blind. You hussy. I expressly told you you were to have nothing to do with that child. - It's all right, Nanny. - It is not all right. I'll have you dismissed. - But, Nanny, it's all right. - Give me that baby. - Honestly, Nanny. - Give me that ba... Aah! Ohh. I remember when Freddy Shaughnessy read it. He got such a fright, he said, when the baby's dropped. And he said to Terence and I, "That's a stunning moment, when the doll crashes to the floor." It was good. - It was good because... - It was dramatic. All the implication is there. Sarah, the very reason for Nanny Webster being here is so that I do not have to keep going to have a word with her. It is your baby! My bag. You haven't hardly seen her since you come home. Pass me my bag. Not proper. Sarah! I loved playing a woman who didn't really care much about her baby 'cause the obvious thing to do is "Aww, here's my little baby." It's so boring. Everybody does that. It's wonderful to play a character... "Oh, yeah, take it away. Take it away. I'm bored. Stop its screaming, for God's sake." And here was this poor old soul coming back to look after the family children. Yeah. And she was a tough old bird, too, wasn't she? Yes. It was a good portrait of an old nanny 'cause she... Yes, 'cause she wasn't a sentimental old thing. - No, she wasn't at all. - Tough old biddy. Yes, tough old disciplinarian, but I think, as an episode, it works terribly well from that point of view because I don't think it's sentimental. But it is touching. Give me that child. - It's all right, Nanny. - Give me that child. I've been waiting, my girl, waiting for you. I-I was just talking to Miss Elizabeth. It's not your place, a girl the likes of you. Mind little Lucy. You're holding her ever so tight. And don't be familiar with baby. She is "baby" to you at all times. You're in no place to be familiar with baby. You're to have nothing to do with her at all. Do you understand? Nothing at all. And she is such a monster. And yet, you know, she obviously once was a good nanny... Not a brilliant nanny, obviously not. She was a bit of an old Tartar. So, that's why I loved her and the way Daphne played it 'cause she didn't play it at all sentimental. Not at all. Daphne Heard, I think, was one of the sort of dyed-in-the-wool actresses who perhaps didn't take too kindly to television and us young whippersnappers who were trying to tell her what to do. But I think we got there in the end. I mean, she was brilliant... Daphne Heard... Did you not think? Terrifying, absolutely terrifying. Have a bottle of champagne downstairs. - Oh, thank you very much, sir. - To welcome the baby. - Sir. - And Nanny Webster. Yes, sir. I can feel the house beginning to shake already. It was jolly interesting, as well, isn't it, about the hierarchy of when the nanny is in the house when she comes back. It's "Who rules the roost?" So, when that thing about "Here comes Nanny Webster back again." Mm-hmm. It's "Ohh, she's going to take over the running of this." Yes. Which they do because the nanny finally was the person who was in charge, wasn't she? Oh, yeah. And Marjorie, then, has to be the one that says to her old nanny, "You can't see." So, thank you, Nanny. Yes. And, of course, I'll make all the necessary arrangements. Yes. Yes. Of course, it is the stairs more than anything. But the baby needs me. Oh, I'll bring Lucy to see you. We'll all come and see you. You were never clumsy. No. We'll come and see you. You've got your corsets off again. Oh, Nanny. And I think it was very well done. I mean, I think you'd find... As a writer, you'd find it... You wouldn't want to try and fault anything about it. It was very well done. It looked really good, and it was beautifully acted. There you are, Sarah. There's your charge. I'm dying for a glass of sherry. Will you take her up to Nanny for me? Now, then. Ain't you a little lambykins, eh? Isn't she a little lambykins, Mr. Hudson? Oh, very nice. Hello, baby. "Hello, baby." "Hello, baby." I can't remember quite. "Hello, baby." Oh, God, he was funny. D-Do you remember the first time I come here, Mr. Hudson? I remember the occasion very clearly. Your face when I tried to come in through the front door. You said I wasn't to question my betters and that you was my better because you was older and wiser than me and I was to learn humility... Do you remember? It's a pity you didn't learn it. Don't you ever have a laugh? On suitable occasions. Come along, Sarah. They're waiting for you. I remember "A Pair of Exiles" very well indeed because I was very pleased with it. I thought it worked very well. Oh, I think it was a romance, all right, with Sarah. I'm not sure that the Edwardians knew how to love very well. They didn't know... The men didn't know how to cherish women. Oh! You're drunk. ‚ô™ Oh, isn't it a pity that the likes of her... ‚ô™ Shut up, you old cow! ‚ô™ Should put upon the likes of him ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - Hey! - Hey! I say, I say, I say... My dog's got no nose. - How does he smell? - Terrible! ‚ô™ As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne ‚ô™ ‚ô™ With an independent air ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You can hear the girls declare ‚ô™ ‚ô™ "He must be a millionaire" ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You can hear them sigh and wish to die ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You can see them wink with the other eye ‚ô™ ‚ô™ At the man who broke the bank ‚ô™ ‚ô™ At Monte Carlo ‚ô™ Pauline Collins, who plays Sarah... As far as I'm concerned, she is a brilliant, marvelous, absolutely masterly actress that I've always loved from the word... The first day she first came to the first read-through and started to read the part, I felt this was magic stuff and she really had it. And I thought myself, "I wonder who cast this girl. She's so terribly talented." I think James is just such a miserable man. I think deep down in his... Bottom of his soul, he was just an unhappy creature. I fainted. I come over all dizzy, and all the room went black. It's the heat in that gin, eh? Jimmy? Yeah? If I tell you something, will you promise not to be cross? Yeah, yeah, I promise. We're up the creek, Jim... 'cause, well... there's a little captain on the way. What? A little James Bellamy. Inside me. Growing all the time, and... Well, I won't be able to work much longer, Jim. So what are we gonna do for money? "There's gonna be a little captain." And that line happened to charm one of our directors, Cyril Coke, who never got over it, and he loved that line so much. And he always used to quote it, every time I saw him, and he used to say, "There's gonna be another little captain." And he just loved that line. And it just seemed to click with him and I was very pleased because that was the intention and it was the moment when she really is, for the first time, definitely obviously pregnant by James. Why don't you say something, Jimmy? I mean, I don't expect you to marry me, but... why don't you say something? Say you'll... you'll come down and visit me in Southwold, me and the baby. Tell me that what they're asking me to do is right. But say something, won't you?! I think quite often what unhappy people do is they fall in love with someone else's happiness. You know, losers fall in love with winners, and he was a loser. And there was this triumphant little sparrow, little Cockney sparrow in Sarah, in Pauline's Sarah. And I think that's what attracted him to her, and very nearly... very nearly, in certain episodes, you get a feeling that she almost took over his life and could have made something of him and maybe they would have gone away and lived in France and he could have become a writer and loosened up a bit. I'm damned if I'll let her leave this house - without saying goodbye. - James! Sarah. Sarah. I'll write to you. You rang, my lady. Oh, yes, Hudson. Close the door, will you? My lady. I've just had confirmation from Buckingham Palace that His Majesty the king will be dining here on Thursday evening. - I understand, my lady. - We shall be 10. Perhaps you'd see about getting in a waiter - to help in the dining room. - Very good, my lady. I remember the episode when the king came to dinner very well and not because particularly of what happened on the day of filming or the rehearsals, but for two or three reasons. I think it's the world's most popular episode. So whenever I've been anywhere in the world and people have wanted to interview me, they always show a bit of that episode. I think the king coming to dinner was so popular because... I always think because Freddy Shaughnessy remembers his parents entertaining the king, so that, you know, it has that sort of authenticity about it, - doesn't it? - Yeah. Any moment now, Hudson. Yes, sir. - Is my tie straight? - Perfect. Listen. Here he is now. Open the door, Hudson. Very good, sir. I remember when the king used to come to dinner at our house quite often in London. And he would come sometimes to dinner, and I remembered the situation of tension in the house, all the servants sort of being allowed to come and look down into the hall from the balcony and all that. And then I remember feeling like Rose... Absolutely outraged that I wasn't allowed to serve at table, that the king... the king was screwing women all over the place, but he wouldn't allow a woman to serve at table. I thought that was startling, and I remember thinking, "Well, you can use that resentment with Rose." I still don't understand why I can't wait at table, same as I always do. His Majesty objects to female servants waiting at the table. You will have ample opportunity of witnessing the dinner from behind the screen, where you will remain out of sight, collecting the empty plates and placing them quietly in the servitor. Yes, Mr. Hudson. I think the king's mean. Then you'd better tell him that yourself. Huh, that's right, Rose. You tell him. I dare you. All right, I will. Hey? Your Majesty, I am Rose, head house parlormaid, and I think it's very mean of you not to let us female servants wait at table. I always thought you rather liked having women around you. Rose! Here, would you like me to sit on your knee? - Get out of that chair at once! - I'll ask Mrs. Keppel. She's a nice lady. She'll put in a word for us. "Hey, Alice, have a word with..." Come along, Rose. That'll do. Come on, off you go now. Both of you, quick. I want to lock up. Chop-chop. It was an experience which I had been through and knew quite intimately, what it was like to have the king coming to dinner and the excitement and all the business, the build-up to it and the cook getting excited about what to give him to eat and all that. Well, I still feel I ought to give him the quail, my lady. Yes, I know you do, Mrs. Bridges, but I do assure you he has quail at every other house he dines at. Very good, my lady. Well, what do you suggest? Well, I suggest we play safe with guinea fowl. And for a main dish, you do the thing you really excel at... Your baron of lamb. Now, there's nobody to touch you for lamb, and you know it. Ruby would have been... And Mrs. Bridges... We would have been in the kitchen from the early hours of the morning. Ruby would have been down there... Heaven knows what time... 4:00 in the morning, 5:00, and... You know, getting the oven ready, cleaning it out, warming it up, scrubbing the floors, getting all the potatoes ready, all the vegetables ready to... For her and Mrs. Bridges to prepare. Oh, oh. Right. Is that done, then, Mrs. Bridges? Oh, stop asking silly questions, girl, and give me the vinegar, quick. We haven't got a lot of time. I remember Angela saying, "We're too tidy." And we were, you know? Ruby was in, then, a very neat little clean apron and hair just not a bit out of place. And we said that to the makeup people. They said, "Oh, no, no, it's absolutely fine. No, you're all right." And Angela said, "No, we're not all right." And I said, "No, we're not all right." So we waited until we were about to do the take and we threw eggs over each other and flour and we really messed ourselves up as the makeup girls... Bless them... Came running towards us and then we were rolling and we carried on, looking exactly as the characters would have looked. If you don't stop ringing that bell, I'll get Mr. Hudson to get the police to you. Why can't king's detective go and shoo them away? Well, isn't that what he's here for? Good heavens, Ruby. What are you thinking of? The royal detective would never demean himself to go out and speak to common people in the street. I remember also having to lay this enormous table and having to get it right because they were filming me doing it. Entr√©e knife, main-course knife, savory knife, spoon for meringue, dessert spoon. Small fork, entr√©e fork, main-course fork, fork for meringue, dessert fork. So I had soup spoon, butter knife, cake knife, savory spoon, entr√©e spoon, entr√©e fork, pudding, and thing, and I did it at each stage. And Gordon said, "What are you muttering?" And I said, "Well, I'm trying to get it right." In fact, when I first had the idea of bringing the king to dinner at the Bellamys' house, I remember thinking at first that I would just see a sort of fat finger with the cigar smoke coming up from it, you know, and drumming on the table impatiently. Why they cast Harry Lockwood West instead of a proper cushioned actor who could have been built out, you know, with a proper tummy... And they didn't do it. And I never asked, but I was so... Sort of didn't like to interfere. I thought it was not my job to say to Martin Case, "Why in God's name did you cast Harry Lockwood West as King Edward? He doesn't look... He's nothing like the same figure." A most delightful evening, Lady Marjorie. Good night, sir. Bellamy, thank you. I enjoyed my bridge. We're very honored, sir. Hudson, the door. The scene that sticks out in my mind is the king leaving and... being addressed by the doctor at the front door, which I thought was really very funny. Oh, of course... this was when Pauline had arrived, expecting the baby. She's expecting the baby. Yeah, that's right. You'd better take me straight to the young woman's room and ask someone to fetch hot water, clean tow... I'm so sorry about that, sir. One of my servants was taken ill, and the doctor had to be sent for in a hurry. We do apologize, sir. The fellow asked me to accompany him to some young woman's bedroom. Who do you suppose he thought I was? Then they played against it with Pauline coming in, Sarah, and having... And that, I thought, was quite stunning, quite very well directed and very well done. Would you rather not stay, Rose? - I must stay, my lady. - It may distress you. I've got to learn. She's all right. And the baby? It was a little boy. Oh. That's that. I didn't think it was a good idea necessarily to have it going on when the king came to dinner 'cause I thought that was egging the pudding. I think that was one of those times when it got melodramatic and sentimental at the same time. But I think I must be wrong because that was a very, very popular episode. I got your note. I couldn't get away before. I'm sorry. What is it, my love? Tell me, what has happened? Charles... I can't go on with it. Can't go on with it? What do you mean? Why? There's an individual, Irish I think, trying to wheedle some money out of you. What do you mean, Watkins? A tradesman of some kind? Uh, no, my lady, um, an old soldier. That... That's what he says. He saw service in India, so he says. I'm sure you had a most interesting conversation, but I don't want to hear about it. Now, will you please take me to the jewelers as I asked you? My lady, this man has in his possession some letters. Letters? Written by your good self, I understand. T-They are signed, so the man claims, by your ladyship and... and coming from Eaton Place. And to whom does he say they are written, these letters? To someone by the name of Captain Hammond, my lady. "Property of a Lady" was, I thought, a very interesting episode because it was written originally by Peter Wildeblood, who was involved with the Edward Montagu case and all that business, which most people remember. And in fact, it was the first attempt by Thomas Watkins to blackmail Lady Marjorie and Lord Bellamy. How much is this man asking for the letters? ¬£200. Ah. That's a great deal of money, sir. Well, if it's a question of keeping her ladyship in ignorance of such a distasteful affair, I'd gladly pay 10 times as much. Peter Wildeblood was upset because we made an enormous number of changes to the plot, which is quite complicated. And he decided to take his name off it, was one of the people who took his name off a script and didn't want to have his name connected with it. I don't know why, oddly enough, because it was an extremely good script, and it worked very well. November 23, 1972, at half past 9:00 in the morning. "The Wages of Sin"... yes, that was a horrendous experience. I remember we were all in the studio on the recording day, waiting to start. And we were being held up. And nobody knew why. And we were just kind of hanging around. And then John Hawkesworth called us all to the center around him. There was a telephone there, and I'd never really looked at it before. I think it was red. And it was like that sort of one on the prime minister's desk and the White House and all that. I looked it. Suddenly, it rang, and we all did like this. So, the P.A. or the director or somebody said to me, "Pick it up." So I picked it up. We got a phone call in the control room from somebody talking on behalf of Chris Beeny, who played Edward. It happened to be an episode which is a very busy one for him. And he'd had a terrible accident on his motorbike on the way to work, and he was in hospital. It was the day of the rail strike. And everyone decided to take cars and everything. I thought, "Well, there's... I've got a motorbike. I'll go to the stu..." It was a Friday. And I thought, "I'll go to the studios on my motorbike." And someone decided I shouldn't be on it and consequently took me off. And I said, "How serious is it?" And they said, "Well, we aren't sure if he'll live till lunchtime." I can remember sort of coming to, after having the impact, lying on the ground with my head rolled over on the right. And I was wearing my motorcycle outfit, you know, with boots and whatever. And I can remember seeing the underside of my shoe there, and my foot was still in it. And I thought, "This is gonna be a bit more than a couple of aspirins." We decided that we would rehearse all the scenes that didn't involve Edward. I was trying to tell him who I was and where I was going. And they thought I had delusions of grandeur. "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Calm down. You're Fred from down the road." "No, no, no, I'm actually on my way to..." And eventually, they got things together because my script was in my pannier bag on the bike. And they suddenly thought, "Oh, yes, he actually is." Of course, in the meantime, in the studio, they were walking around, saying, "Where the hell's he got to?" So, immediate crisis conference, and Freddy and Martin Case and Stella Ashley and the director and myself got together. And we decided... It wasn't a terribly big part for the footman in that episode. We decided to make it a girl. And John Hawkesworth went off, got in touch with Martin Case, who was the casting director, and said, "You've got to find someone to take over from Chris Beeny. We're going to write a new character who's taken over because he's gone on holiday. This is all gonna have to be put in the script, and we're gonna do it now." And they transferred my part to a girl called Jane Carr. But I was just looking for Sarah. Ah, there you are. You're wanted over at the house. - Who wants me? - Well, Nanny wants you. It's time for the baby's bath. Sod Nanny. And sod the baby. Right you are. I'll tell them. She got to the studios at about 11:00, 12:00. They found a wig for her. They found a costume for her. Meanwhile, Freddy and John were rewriting the script. By 2:00, she was sitting in the makeup chair with the costume and the wig on. They were doing her makeup. And by about half past 3:00 or 4:00, we'd rehearsed all the scenes without Edward, she came into the studio, and we winged all the new scenes, which John Hawkesworth and Freddy had actually written that morning. She was absolutely wonderful. I mean, the crew applauded her. She was so professional and just doing it like that, off the, you know... It was brilliant. And they did it line by line, shot by shot. It was quite horrific. I'm still suffering here 30 years later, but I'm alive and I'm working, you know? I've still got steel plates in my legs. We went home at 7:00, having rehearsed them as best we could. We had to make up the shots as we went along because it was totally new material. She learnt it overnight. We did a dress run on the Thursday morning. Friday morning, she was word-perfect, and we did our recording in the afternoon, as though nothing had happened. It was an extraordinary feat of organization, not only wonderful for the actress to do that overnight, to learn... It was quite an extensive part. She learned that overnight. But the whole team... I mean, bits had to be re-lit. Bits had to be re-staged. No one batted an eyelid. We had to make the shots up as we went along. The cameraman wrote them all down in longhand, the vision mixer made notes, we ran each scene perhaps a couple of times, and it went like clockwork. I wouldn't have thought it would have been possible, but it was. I do owe my continuance in the series to John Alderton, who was fabulous. I mean, they were all for writing me out. I mean, the way they got rid of me was Gordon Jackson going in to Mr. Bellamy and saying... Edward, as you know, is away with his bad leg. And that was it. I was out of the series. And they wanted to write me out of the series. And John Alderton said, "Hey, just a minute, just a minute." He was going to shoot number 12, and there's only number 13 to go. Then we're shutting down for six months before we go on to the next series, and by that time, we knew we were going to do the next series. And he said, "Just a minute. You know, it's a long way off. He can recoup himself before then. Don't, you know..." And they didn't. And I continued to do it. Rose, take these before I drop them all. Very good, madam. Any news of Edward? Hospital said he broke his leg in three places. Oh, those kitchen stairs are a deathtrap. "A Family Gathering," and the idea was that it was going to be Lady Marjorie's birthday and she decided to have a few people to drinks and to talk. And... And they all assembled in her house. And it was during that gathering that Thomas and Sarah suddenly made this unexpected appearance. He's exaggerating. Hope you don't mind us barging in, my lady, but I just wanted to wish you happy birthday. I wonder what sort of king the new one will be. Worthy. Not the same. Jack Alexander said the queen sent for Mrs. Keppel this afternoon to come over and sit with him. 1901 to 1910. The children will have a new date to learn for their history examinations. - I - rather liked the idea of "The children will have a new date to learn for their lessons." And also, I was very keen to have a sort of thing about "The children will be all right. They're young," as though the young people, which is the one generation which is gonna get slaughtered in the next World War, were gonna be okay, as it were, which was optimistic thinking, you know, 'cause they weren't... Far from safe, you know? They were all butchered at the front. Are you coming in? You'll catch cold out there. It's all right, Father. It's quite warm. Leave the children. They'll come to no harm. They're young. There was often talk about an "Upstairs Downstairs" film. I think the first time it was mooted was after the second series. I did know of it and I did actually write the script, but I never heard anyone talk about it and it just sank without trace. I thought there was going to be a movie. There was word there was going to be a movie. It was going to be financed by America. I think that's where they were going to get the money from. Therefore, they needed a young girl, thing, but she had to be American. John put his list on his lectern that he always had. "Everybody, now, please sit down. Now, the following will not be in the film." It was cricket-11, you know? For the household, it was. So, instead of me being part of the household, they were going to get somebody in from America to be part of the household. And I thought, "Well, if you don't want me, I'm off." Great shame because Nicola was ravishing and just wonderful. - She really was. - Very, very good, too. Yes. So beautiful. Yes, I think a lot of people were quite upset they weren't going to be in the film. You can't imagine not wanting to film her, can you? Nothing really happened to it because to have the core of "Upstairs Downstairs" would have been, really, very difficult. There would have been too much in it. It was the perfect idea for a television series, not for a film. It wasn't set in Eaton Place, no. It was set in a country house. And I think nobody really took up on it because it would have been very difficult to squash it all, to have all its elements in 1 3/4 hours. John and Pauline wanted to leave. And I thought, "Well, they are pretty successful, and they seem to know what they're doing, so maybe it's a good move." I knew the Aldertons were going to go 'cause they said, "We want to go at the end of the second series." And I knew Nicola Pagett was going to go, but I was very shaken when her agent said, "I have to advise Nicola to go 'cause she's gonna get typecast." The most dramatic thing that happened to it was, um, that Rachel Gurney as Lady Bellamy left, because she was incredibly important and very popular. And I thought, you know, one day she'll say... And she did say, "Look, I think about the end of the second series if that's all right"... Gave me lots and lots of time. And I said, "Well..." We'd sort of worked out the stories... "would you appear in one, perhaps, or two of a third series so that we can dispose of you gracefully?" Subtitling made possible by Acorn Media
