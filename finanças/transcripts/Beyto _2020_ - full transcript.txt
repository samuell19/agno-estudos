Mike, Beyto, Barni, Pit! Ready. Come on, Beyto! You can do it! Faster! Beyto just needs to work on his turns. He could do well at the championships. Okay. I'll work on it with him. It'll be fine. Hey Mike! Your bike fell over. Mike! Mike! - What? Oh, shit! Why do you overload it like that? You won't believe it, the farmer wanted to throw all this away, just because it doesn't look perfect. If you need a carrot... Where to? I can take these three with me. It's on my way. You're a champ! These onions... You can leave them on the doorstep. Beyto. You promised your training wouldn't interfere with work. Today was an exception. An exception? It's the third time this week. They want you at their meeting. One condition: Improve your English. Language classes two nights a week. When I'm at my English class, you can close up earlier. Right! We need the money, my boy. To finance uncle Memduh's partying. Mind your tongue, cheeky. Stop sending him so much money,. Go and take that out. I'd marry that one in a heartbeat. That's a slut not marriage material. Hey, hey! - Watch it, bitch! Hi Beyto! - Hey! Are you good? - Yeah and you? Yeah. Are you coming to summer training? Hey Mike! He can beat you, right? - This one here? If he tries a bit harder, possibly. We're off to a party. You coming? I have to work, sorry. Come with me. I can get you on the guest list. It's okay. Bye guys! — See you! Are you going to let these ladies walk away? What a pussy! That ass, those its, those legs! What brings you here? - This is for you. He'll never fall for a Swiss girl. Turkish women are too beautiful. No way. A friend from my swim team. Homegrown, all organic. What about our workout? Want to go? What does he want from you? What do you care? I'm here till 9pm. Enjoy! Sorry, I don't eat meat. Man, just eat it! That's an insult. Okay, let's make a deal. You eat pork and I'll have the kebab. You can go. I'll help your dad close up. I'll get my stuff. Fucking résti-muncher. Shut up! Cute. That's Seher. We grew up together, before I moved here. It looks like Turkey in here. She's pretty! Keep going! Faster, faster! Come on! Three more! Two... Two... What's wrong, princess? Keep pushing! Three! Fuck you, man! That's what you get for eating kebabs every day! Come on, we're not finished. Are youin love? Is that why? What the fuck? What about Nina? She's into you, right? Did you get some? - Man, what's up with you? Sexy, right? Are you gay, man? Yes. Are you scared of a faggot? Hello, my boy. You're late. I was out with a friend. With Faruk. - Faruk? Which Faruk? He grew up here, did a bank apprenticeship. I don't think I know him. Do I know his parents? I don't know. Where is he from in Turkey? Istanbul, I think. Yes, we won't know him then. He told me, he's in love. With a girl from Istanbul? No, he's in love with a man. He showed me a photograph. I don't want to hear stories like that. A man can love a man. That's enough! I don't understand what those men have against women. Two men... Just the thought is repulsive. They don't have anything against women! Why are you getting so worked up? What do you care? Don't worry about those losers. Stop staring at my ass. Stay focused. - Fuck you, man. Can't the renovations wait? It's a lot of money. Seyit, we're a family. We'll get by. Glingdr doesn't want Seher to live in the city. Studying, she won't have time for anything else. He wants her to marry Beyto. What is she going to do with a degree? You're so old-fashioned! Hello, my boy. Come on. Tits and long legs? Is that all you talk about? Hey, it's what people want to hear! When you think of Nina... Yeah, but still, I mean, a song should be deeper. Bro, listen. I'm stocking shelves all day, shoving crates around. My boss gets on my nerves. I don't want to do this forever. This could be my way out. Mike, you've got a visitor. Hey. Hey! We've got some great tomatoes. That's enough for a couple of kebabs. I've come to take some pictures. Look at this. You need one of those. The way you drive around, you're the perfect organ donor. That's cool, but too expensive. I can't afford that. Crowdfunding? As if they'd pay for a trailer. Look at this! Less waste. Social. That sells! You're serious? Stop sulking, come on. This isn't for Instagram. More professionalism, please. A man, who dresses me instead of undressing me. Exciting. We won't get anything done like this. What are you doing later? I'm having a party soon. You could make some Turkish food. Hey! Don't you want to get in? I have to go. Hey, I thought you were coming to my place. Hey, is he bothering you? Hey, you fucking bum! What the hell? Listen to that engine purr. How fast does it go? Seriously, man? It can easily do 210 on the motorway. How about 2607 You're a bunch of idiots. Relax, man. We're not all nerds, like you. Can you drop me off here? I'm not even doing 30, man. But Nina's waiting for me. Bro, play hard to get! - Goddamn! But hey, is she as good in bed as she looks? Hey. Hey. I've uploaded everything. Do you want to see it, before I send it off? You act like you don't know me with your friends. Back home, there are 400 sheep und 300 people. Sometimes, I even herd the sheep. I used to love doing that too. My parents are farmers. I haven't seen them in ages. We fell out. Because... Do you know free churches? They're not really into gays. But do you know why I'm gay? Because it's beautiful. Because it's me. And your swimming trunks? Where's the sea? There's no water! But plenty of sun. The food is good too. I was six years old, when we moved here to join my dad. I was totally lost. Next time, I'll come with you. You can introduce me to all your cousins. Do you know what gay means in Turkish? "Ass-giver". They have noidea. Does anybody know what's going on with you? Your parents don't know, right? What about your friends? One of them? It would be easier for me, if I could move out. And until then, you'll give Nina false hope? You have no idea, what it's like. Back home, gays are seduced by the devil. And? Do you believe that? Do you believe that? Hey! Take this off. I'm at Gay Pride. It's amazing. Come! I'm training. Finally, we're partners. The shop is ours now. Our new Turkish community centre. Let's hope for the best. - Yes. Enjoy your tea. Okay, then. Take care. - See you later. Ah, look, like back home. Wow... I miss every comer of it. - Right? If only we could afford to go back. Come on. When we're there, you miss Switzerland. I am made out of that earth. I don't care. I'm staying here. I can't hear you. It's too loud here, I'll call you back later. Oh my God! Seyit's clever boy. Their only child. Hey nerd. You did it again. Top of the class, even though you never show up. What nice things you found. Even some brand clothes. Very nice. Thank you so much. I wish I could keep it to myself. What? Ask Ceylan. Go on, tell me, Fatma. We were at that demonstration. By accident. What demonstration? That parade where men kiss men. You know the one. We saw Beyto there. He was dancing. Andaman... They were kissing. Narin, I'm so sorry. What are you talking about? He was here all day. He was helping us all day. Hello. - Hello, how are things? I came first in class. We celebrated at the office. My clever boy. My clever boy. BEYTO-IT. He could even open his own business. Fatma saw Beyto. - Where? At that demonstration. What demonstration? That men's demonstration. - What? Those men who swing the other way. Are you joking? Narin! She's lying. - Of course, she is. You know how she likes to gossip. I'm sure she's already told everyone about it. Just wait. Just wait. Get up! Come here. Get up! Come on, you imbecile! Were you at that demonstration? What demonstration? That gay demonstration! You weren't, were you? Fatma said you kissed a man! I'm sure she's wrong. — My boy, tell me the truth. Were you there or not? My boy, you weren't there, right? No, mum, I wasn't. - Okay, good. Goon, go back to bed. Good night! Of course not. You're my son, after all. Come on, let's go to bed. Good night! I work day and night, so he can study. I serve sluts, drunkards, junkies. Okay, calm down! How am I supposed to calm down? We can't go back to the village. We marry him to Seher. — Marry? Hear me out. You know how much he likes her. They grew up together. He can go back to the village this summer, to see Seher. And then they can marry. That will bring him to his senses. To hell with his senses! Once he's married, no one can say anything. No way! I can't believe it! You're incredible! How did you do this? We all want some of your carrots! You're a champ! Hey, man. Maybe not the best idea here. My aunt saw us at the Gay Pride. Oh, shit! Well, at least they know now. And? How did they react? They need time. I.-- I found something. Training programs for swimmers and their coaches. This could be for you. With you? I think so. I could put myself down as a trainer. You a trainer? Hey, what's wrong? You think I can't do it? We'd have our own flat there. We can chill together. Work out together... Seyit, you have to get your son under control. Sort out your family. There are still cheap flights on the 24th. I want to stay here this summer. You can't. I have to train for the regionals. You're Turkish. Why do you want to swim for Switzerland? Swimming is important to me. Your grandma keeps asking about you. She is dying. You know, she loves you more than anything. But I saw her last year. Let me work here. Stop talking back to us! Do as your mother tells you. The pool is fucking amazing! And we're only 15 minutes away. Mike... The flat is right in the centre. - Mike. I have to go to Turkey this summer. You want to cancel? My grandmother is on her deathbed. And she wants to see me, one last time. I just show up there on my own, as a trainer? I'll fly from Ankara straight to Leipzig. There's no other way. I have to hand in daily reports. I don't even know what a report looks like! You're so good with people. Just write like you talk. You don't get it. You're the one with the brains! You're in an office all day. No, I don't want to. Leave me alone. Leave me bel You're an idiot, man. Stop it! No! Stop that! Take something out, overweight is expensive. What overweight? We need all this! These suits are for the wedding. All this is for the wedding. The wedding will be beautiful. All of this is for my son! And this? Presents. You know, how happy that makes them. Remove the price tags. It's embarrassing. What if he doesn't come? Go to bed. I'll get this. — Okay. Good night. My parents have called me five times already. Get out of here then. You won't forget me? Send me a picture every day. There's no signal in the village. Are you joking? Taxi? - No, thank you. My brother. - Welcome. Hello. Sister in law. —Hello. Uncle. - Welcome! We saw all the new builds on our way in. We've made progress. We're reaping the benefits now. I can see that. We owe that all to you. You've always supported us. May God protect you. Did Bekir marry an American girl? Yes. - Really? I don't get it either. This year has been tough. - Really? We've lost 50 sheep. Cidem told us. Mesut got sick. He had to go to hospital. Is he better now? - Yes, yes. Beyto! Beyto! Welcome, brother. Welcome! - Hello! Okay, make the cut. In the name of God. God is great. In the name of God. Grandma. God be praised. The eye of my apple, my sweetheart. You look well, praise God. How are you, Ahmet? - Well. How are you? — I'm well, thank you. Seyit! Us elders would like to hear about Beyto's education. Beyto has great grades. Better than the Swiss students. The company are eager to keep him. Beyto understands a computer, as if he invented it himself. Pretty, right? — Beautiful. Let me see. Beautiful, it suits you perfectly. Yes, it does. - I hope you like it. This is very nice too. - Yes, this cream really softens your skin. Beyto, what are Swiss women like? Metin says he's slept with seven. How about you? Metin is exaggerating. I saw them on TV wearing miniskirts and crop tops. Do they really walk around like that? Is that all you guys watch? And their breasts spill out. Beyto has hit the jackpot with Seher. Seher too, has hit the jackpot. Why don't you marry a Western girl? I got a nice blue shirt for the wedding. Who's getting married? He hasn't lost his sense of humour. Beyto and Seher are getting married. Seher? What the hell is going on? Come visit us again soon. Bye. - Bye. Thank you for everything. — You're welcome. Bye. - Bye. Come visit us again soon. All the girls are talking about you. I'm not marrying Seher. You can forget that! That's not up to you. Seher is like a sister to me. That's great. What more do you want? You tricked me! You're still very young. You don't know what's best for you. You'll thank us eventually. Don't you care about what I want? I promised your grandfather. The whole village knows. Don't embarrass us. We're doing all this for you. Marriage will make you happy. You'll see. I'm flying home tomorrow. You! Pull yourself together, before I lose my temper. I can't love Seher, or any other woman. I'm in love with a man. I can't believe my ears! I love Mike! No, don't! Both of you, stop! Go away! Listen to me. You won't find a better girl than her. She'll stick with us, even in bad times. You marry Seher, or I'll burn this! And you'll join the army! They'll turn you into a man there! Seher. Seher. Please open the window. We have to talk. Seher. You only have to wait a few hours now. When you lift her veil tomorrow, she'll be yours. I'm sure you can wait until then. Come on. Go home. I'm sorry. Good night. Your father hasn't slept all night. He has never hit you. And me? What about me? What about you? You are going to marry and be happy. You like children. You're going to be a great dad. But I want to live with Mike. Get married first. Seher is understanding. You can do what you want. How can you support something like that? What do you think? Do you think I chose Seyit myself? But look at us now. How happy we are now. And we have you. And that's all that counts. Not love, but family. Your father is taking you into town to buy a suit. Hell choose for you, if you don't go. Go on! I can't marry Seher. What? I have a girlfriend in Switzerland. If you don't marry, she'll be looked at as a secondhand wife. You can live with Seher and have a girlfriend too. Western women are open to that. It's not like you think, there. Goon, tell me. Is your girlfriend sexy? Welcome. - Hello. Don't embarrass us. Just think what you'll do to us. And what will come of Seher? Come on, my boy, my sweetheart. Put this on. They're waiting for us. My dearest boy. My handsome boy. Mum, Mum, please... Put this on. Slip it on. Come on. This is going to be beautiful. Really beautiful, my boy. Beyto... My strong boy. Yes, they're waiting for us. We're going downstairs now, okay? You won't upset your mother. Am I right, my boy? Come on, help me. They're waiting. Okay. You're strong. Like a lion. Okay. Okay, let's go. Congratulations. - Thank you. I declare you husband and wife. Amen. Welcome, thank you. Congratulations, Seyit. — Thank you. Welcome. - Thank you. Beyto comes from here, but he forgot, how to behave as a groom. Can you help me? When did you learn German? I learnt it for you. Seher? Can we do this another time? I don't feel well. No problem. I heard that you're best in class. I don't want to be a doctor anymore. The degree is too long and too expensive. Maybe I'll be a pharmacist. And I could work during my studies. So we'd have another income. Will our mother let me leave the house? Let's talk about this tomorrow. You're annoying. You've always been good at that. Guess what I heard about your uncle Memduh. Recently, when he came home, there was a naked woman in his bed. He started stroking her breasts. The woman asked, what he was doing. And he said, he was looking for a song on the radio. Then they sang a beautiful song together. Narin is happy to finally have a daughter at home. Right, Narin? - Yes, of course. All that's missing now, are lots of grandchildren. Seher will support you and be a great wife. Your family is proud of you, Beyto. See, everything went well. I have to talk to you. — Beyto, congratulations! Thank you. Beyto! When are you taking Seher to Switzerland? Can I come too? I don't want to rot away here. Look, there's Beyto and Seher. Congratulations, Beyto. — Congratulations, Beyto. Tell me, Beyto. How was it? Beyto and Seher are married. Did you see my blue shirt? - I did. I can't wear it today. But you saw it? - Yes. Beyto! Have some tea. No thank you. Congratulations, my brother. Seher, congratulations to you too. — Thank you. You won't find anyone better than Seher there. Congratulations, Beyto. Come on, Ferid. Beyto has become very Swiss. Seher... Beyto, are you okay? I have to be honest with you. I love someone else. Someone from the West? I didn't want this wedding. What does this woman have, that I don't? Seher, I like you and I don't want to hurt you. But you are hurting me. Why did you sleep with me, if you're one of those? I wanted it to work with a woman. If any woman, it had to be you! But Beyto, it did work. What more do you want? I cant... I want him. What am I going to do now? I'd only make you unhappy. Unhappy? You have no ideal I'll be cast out. Is that what you want? Why the fuck won't you work? If you leave me here, I'll become the laughing stock of the village. My father won't let me study. Don't you want to have kids? You'll like Switzerland. You'll make friends easily. I want to study. Of course, my dear. Beyto will show you everything. He'll take you out, buy you nice clothes. I'm so jealous. Switzerland isn't like you imagine it. Not everyone lives in luxury. Look around here. There's no jobs, not even in the city. Ferid, are you hurt? Come here, it's okay. - My hand hurts. This manure will help, okay? Seher's good at that. All she does is study medicine, chemistry, maths and that shit. Don't exaggerate. Have you ever come out with us? Hello. - Hello, jump in. Seher is a clever girl. She'll be fine in the West. I'm just a shepherd. I could never make it abroad. What about our right to freedom? Look. Beyto, we all have responsibilities. I keep an eye on things in the village. So that despite politics and unemployment, no one has to go hungry. Freedom is up here. I want to live with my boyfriend, and Seher deserves a man who loves her. Seher needs an education. Love can wait. The same goes for you. You can watt too. If you want to come, I'll be waiting outside. Did you want to go back to him? This language! This language! What if I don't pass? You can do this. Come on. Let's do it again, together. The earth... in the next... - Next. years will get... - Get. ..even hotter. Do women do this too in Switzerland? How am I going to manage? I can't imagine what it's like there. We made you some tea for the journey. My dearest little daughter. Please don't cry. Call me at least once a week. And get in touch as soon as you arrive. This year will fly by. I'll be picking you up at the airport soon again. God willing. There might be five of us next time. - God willing. We shall see, God willing. I'm feeling like shit. Where are you?! What's going on, man? I'm coming home today. Your new home, my little daughter. Do you like it? You don't need to do that here. Can we do something together? Don't you want to eat something? Sweetheart, take this into the bathroom please. Yes, it's beautiful here. I'll see you again soon. Don't cry. Okay. Okay, I love you. Kisses. Lazy Metin. He only made half our usual turnover. I'll take another look at it. Where should we get all that money from? Don't worry. Beyto has a good wage. He can take on a bit more responsibility. Come with me, my dear. With a woman like this, nothing can go wrong. When are they having a party for you? May God praise you with luck. What are you doing here? Beyto married. Show him the pictures. Seher. She's one of us. Beyto is with Seher now I can explain. Go inside. — Shut your mouth! Family is important to us. Leave him alone. Fuck, man. - Mike! Beyto! — Mike, wait! Gt oft Get off - Gol Shit, man! - Beyto! Fuck! Pull over! I can't believe it! A fucking wedding! I can't believe it! Are you trying to kill us? My dad took away my passport and tickets. He threatened to send me to the army. I was offered a job in Leipzig as a trainer's assistant! |turned it down, because of you, asshole! You lied to me from the start. You never told your parents. They found out. That's why they organised the wedding. Come on! I wasn't part of your plans anyway. But you just couldn't resist my dick! Mike! I don't see you for a few days, and you're the perfect son again. Did you fuck her? Tell me! Did you? Did you fuck her? You think I'll be your bit on the side? Why do you leave me alone here? Say something. In the next few days, I'll decide who goes to the championships. Is Mike not coming? He called in sick. What is it with you two? Okay, okay. — Watch out for the books! It's stuck. - No, you're fine. It's through here. Okay, keep going. - Be careful, my dear. Hold on, I'm stuck. My arm, my arm. You're getting the big room. We don't need it. Go on, tell me where to put the bed. My room was fine. What if a baby comes along? Coming through. - Yes, come in. There. So, this is the beautiful Seher. Where should that dresser go? Bro, come help me set this up. It'll take forever with your dad. — Shut it! Your room is going to be beautiful. This isn't the life I want! I don't understand him. Hey man, what's going on? Did you know about the wedding? No, I didn't. But I heard a strange rumour about you. Is it true, bro? Yes, it's true. How can you fancy men? Women are such beautiful creatures? Maybe you just have to grow up a bit. Try things out. Maybe things will change again. Come on, I don't see you suddenly falling for men. What's it like with a man? Did you have sex? Yes, we did. And it was amazing. What a mess, man. And now? What are you going to do? Are you still seeing him? He found out about the wedding. He doesn't want anything to do with me anymore. Idiot! Doesn't he get it? If you continue like this, you won't make the cut. What the fuck is wrong with you? You want to mess up my chances as a trainer too? Mike. I did tell my parents I love you. When we got to Turkey. And? Are you getting a divorce? Or you'll keep on like this forever? I can't act like this has nothing to do with me. But acting like a married, straight man, that's okay? Why don't you get what it's like for us! Hello. I'm taking part at the championships. We're celebrating your wedding that night. And then you're off to Geneva. Miray is throwing you a big party. Defoe from Willisau wants to meet Seher too. We can go another time. Don't you get it? This is an honour for me. I want to return home and you're competing for Switzerland. He's even more conservative than the villagers. My mother doesn't want a girl from the village. Those women would only tie me down. And I'm a ladies' man. I want to study and go out too. And you two want to share a bed and each meet a man. Go on, go get some fresh air. We'll take over tonight. Great! See you later then. Metin, you're staying here. Seher, do you want to go inside? There's a good band on tonight. Do you think, I can stroke him? Come on, Seher. Let's go. Is this important to you? I feel great when I swim. You forget about everything. No matter who you are. Whether you speak the language or not. Whether you ft into this world or not. All you see is the blue water. And you feel full-filed and whole. Can you show me? What are you doing? I'm stuck here. I don't know the language or the city. What should I do? What am I doing here? What do you want? Do you see yourself living abroad? The three of us could move away. The three of us? Of course. Imagine how you'd feel, if I showed up with my cousin. Come on, you'll like Seher. You've got a convenient set-up. When we fall out, you'll continue with her. Calm down, man! You Turks and your families. I know how this is going to end. You, the perfect family man with kids, and I'm the lover on the side. What the fuck is wrong with you? I'd stay here, if I wanted that! I want to get out of here. Because I want to live with you. Yes. Yes, yes... No. No, he didn't come to work today. May God strike him! He didn't go to work. - What? He just didn't show up. Whoever treats us like this, is not our son. I'm going back home. What are you talking about? Then everyone will know he ran away with a man. No way! I won't let you ruin our family. You can't change me. If you don't look after Seher, just see how I'll change you. Look. In this picture, you didn't know that I was gay. And look at me now. Do you see a difference? You... You always talk about respect. But you have no respect whatsoever for mel Where is Seher? - I don't know. She's gone. She'll get lost in the dark. She doesn't know her way around. What have you done to her? Go and find her! Go! Come. Come on, I'll show you something. You'll like it. Come on. My feet aren't touching the ground. I've got you. Trust me. Flap your wings. Look, like this. Hold on tight. Hold on. One, two, three. Do you want to go to Germany? You, me and Mike would come too. Mike... The three of us? Yes. It'll be easier for you to learn German there. And what does Mike say? It's weird for him and for me, no? I just can't take it anymore here. I don't want to spend my whole life pretending. Don't you want to meet someone too? And how will we make a living? I'll get a job, and you can study. We'll make it work. We can go for walks, go out at night, do all kinds of things. We can be free. Man, I'd suffocate in here too. And? Have you found anything? Chill, bro! It's not that easy! Nothing? Not nothing. You could sell kebabs in a shop in Leipzig. Great, man. Man, do you want to sell kebabs forever? I don't give a shit. As long as I get out of here. Man, I've got a job in Leipzig. What? How did you manage that? If it's just the two of us, fine. But focus on the race now, okay? If you win... Hey, no homo hanky panky around here. Okay then. Show them what you've got. On your marks, get set... Go, go! Come on! Yes, yes! Keep going! Come on! Go, go! Go Beyto, go! Come on, Beyto! He's winning! He's winning! Come on, Beyto! You can do this! You're incredible! You're amazing, man! You won! You won! Congratulations! I knew you could do it! Well done! We have to toast this! See you in the team room in half an hour. We can'. We have to go. My parents are waiting. I'll see you later. What does "later" mean? He won. I cant stand this anymore. I'm leaving. Are you coming? Is Mike coming too? I don't know. Either way, I'm leaving. Nothing is going to change here. They're both unhappy. Oh, Seyit, what have we done? Hey! Hey. My name is Seher. Tell him, I've heard so much about him. She's heard a lot about you. Hey man, are you crazy? - What does that feel like? Where you're from, that's sick. Damn prejudices. Tell him I've read a lot about Switzerland. He can do some research too. Idiot! What did she say? Translate, man! You're always so laid-back, but when it really matters... She didn't say that. You should learn more about Turkey. That's what she said. Do you two really think, we can push our problems aside? It'll all work out in the end, right? Man, give us this chance! The three of us, no money, on someone's couch. She can't even speak German. What did he say? What did he say? Come one, let's go. There's no point. What's your problem with me? You're okay. Soon, I know German! Then we talk! Fuck, man! I can't keep going like this. She wants to get to know you. If we move in together, I want my own room. I'm going to learn a profession and work. I'm going to go out, whenever I want. And it's none of your business. I'm not responsible for the housework. And I'm not going to cook or clean either. If I feel like it, I'll prepare a Turkish dish sometimes. I'll bring friends home. And maybe even a man. Is that clear? That sounds like a plan.
