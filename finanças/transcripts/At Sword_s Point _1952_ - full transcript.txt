GUNSHOT The year 1648 was a grim one for France. With the death of the Cardinal Richelieu, the hand holding the country together was gone. Terror and violence ruled as the nobles plotted to gain control. GUNSHOT No papers, as usual. What is the use of this constant prying, monsieur? I'm dying and we both know it. The Duke de Lavalle knows it too. The sight of him is more bitter than medicine but I dare not refuse him. Such is the state of France today. Her majesty has the loyalty of her subjects. Which pleases me, but their loyalty is powerless against Lavalle's soldiers. The Duke de Lavalle. How is Your Majesty's health today? I regret to disappoint you but I feel stronger. Nothing gives me more happiness. No, unless it were to be my death. Well, what do you conceal there? So, another of my men has been waylaid. A gang of outlaws. My soldiers found him and brought me this. Your soldiers killed him! Your suspicions grieve me. My first concern is the welfare of the Queen. Let us not continue this hypocrisy. Understand, our ambition is the same - the security of France. There is suspicion because your son is hidden. What do you propose? Bring him to Paris, let me marry your daughter - the royal house will be strong until Louis can reign. Never! I may be feeble in body but not in mind. You wouldn't let Louis live long enough to come of age. You talk of security for France, but you plan security for yourself. I swear to you upon my honour... Honour, the word is spoken easily by one who is without it. If I had not feared my son's life would I have sent him away? God will save him and us all from you. Your Majesty's faith is touching. It is all I have left. Now go, please. Your Highness. Countess. I trust you enjoyed your ride? Exceedingly, Your Grace. It is one of the pleasures that's permitted. How lovely you look. I've not seen a gown your beauty could not enhance. My hand, if you please. A thousand pardons. A touch of your hand is worth all the treasures in the world. I look forward to the day when Her Majesty gives consent to our union. I cannot share your feelings. Madame, what has happened? Our last hope has gone. Murdered, by Lavalle's troops. The fifth messenger I've sent to the King of Spain, the fifth to die. Is there no-one else to trust? No-one. Lavalle's ears as well as his troops are everywhere. It's hopeless. Hopeless. I have so little time. Henriette, what will become of you and your brother when I am dead? I do not know, madame. This is my kingdom now - all that is left of my power and glory. Lavalle has taken everything else. Your father and I dreamed of France as prosperous and at peace. We were safe then from such as Lavalle. The King's Musketeers were our guardians. Lavalle disbanded them, that is why I'm so helpless now. There were nobles once who sought our lives. My four Musketeers saved us. I remember how gay they were the day they fought - Athos, the giant Porthos, Aramis - no woman was safe with him, or wanted to be - D'Artagnan, his sword had no equal in Europe. Bring me my jewel casket. Yes, madame. That day, I gave them each a ring and kept four others like them. I said, "Messieurs, if one day a messenger brings you a ring, "a ring... "like this, you will know that I'm in danger." Today, the throne of France is in danger. Master D'Artagnan! Master D'Artagnan! You're wanted at the house. You sent for me, Mother. A messenger brought this, my son. The Queen's ring? She must be in danger, to have sent that. Then I must go at once, for father. Saddle my horse! My father's sword! I have a legend to live up to. Use it well and wisely. I will use it as father would have - with honour and in the Queen's name. Goodbye, Mother. Goodbye, my son. A moment, messieurs. Why do you follow me? We do not. Let me put it this way, why am I always just ahead of you? Perhaps, we're just going your way. Which way? Bordeaux. The road to Bordeaux is half a league back. The Regent's Guards are not used to being called liars. The Queen's Musketeers are not used to being followed. A Musketeer - you? He thinks he is his father! That's why you follow me? You follow me no further. Shall we try the other arm? Now the odds are more even. I hope I'm not intruding. > Your husband? No, monsieur. What do you want? I'm looking for Monsieur Aramis. I'm Aramis. Who are you? D'Artagnan, at your service. D'Artagnan! I ride for my father. And I for mine. This will be an interesting journey. First, kiss then to Paris. The Queen's business can't wait upon a kiss especially one from you. Hmmm, pity. Well, be true to me until I return, my sweet. Remember the Queen's business. It's a pity the Queen's business cannot wait. Au revoir, mademoiselle. You come like ghosts out of the past. So, you were their sons? Yes, Monsieur Porthos. Laddy! Yes, father. This is my son. This is Aramis... Aramis. ..and D'Artagnan... D'Artagnan. ..sons of the noblest comrades. Bring me my sword, Her Majesty needs me. It is useless. I had hoped to ride with you...but I cannot. Devil take this gout. Yet D'Artagnan and Aramis ride in their father's stead. I shall ride for you. One for all. ALL: One for all and all for one. Ride hard and fast, my lads. What about Athos? His estate lies far to the north. I've not seen him since his wedding. Wait at the sign of the Golden Cockerel. That was our rendezvous. Touche! A beautiful hit. There's nothing more I can teach you. Monsieur's too kind. I have seen the best swordsmen fight and you are their equal, with the exception of D'Artagnan. I am flattered, monsieur, but you exaggerate. No, mademoiselle, there are not... Claire, a messenger from the Queen. The Queen? He expected to find father. Remember, you will be the man of the house while I'm away. I am the son of Athos. I should go. Not now, dear, when you're a little older. Madame. Shades of Pluto! Have you returned from the grave? D'Artagnan, Aramis, Porthos. Your fathers have begotten themselves. Where is Athos? We are waiting here. Are we welcome? Welcome. It's like the return of my youth! You've never passed it. Exactly like your father. Corporal. Corporal, come here. Would you not know them anywhere? I fought with their fathers. It's good to see old friends. Corporal, take them inside. Give them food and drink. We'll drink a toast to your fathers and my father. Madame, I understand this was the rendezvous of the Musketeers. Which Musketeers? D'Artagnan, Porthos, Aramis. Oh, the OLD Musketeers. Are they very old? I have not seen them in many years. Monsieur, not so loud. One of the Regent's men might hear you. I'll see if there's any sign of the men. LAUGHTER Messieurs, a stranger is asking for you. ARAMIS: No time for strangers, unless they're girls and beautiful! A beautiful girl may not have time. My, my, what a pretty boy! And what a sharp tongue. Did you feel the sting? On your way, lad! Monsieur! I said, "On your way." He'll cut you to ribbons. I think not. Hold! That ring! Who are you? I am Athos. Athos! Welcome, lad, I'm Aramis. I am Porthos. I am D'Artagnan, with apologies. This occasion must be drowned. More wine! Why didn't you say you were Athos? I tried to but was unlucky to cross swords with D'Artagnan. You could have beaten Porthos? Perhaps. And me? Of course. Presumptuous, pretty boy. I don't like those words. I withdraw them. No fighting. Our motto is... I know, one for all and all for one. To Athos. ALL: To Athos. I'm accepted? The fourth Musketeer. Athos fights like a tiger but drinks like a hummingbird. I'm drunk with the excitement of this meeting. Follow me, I'll show you to your quarters. I could sleep for a week. You ate enough for a week! I have a bed big enough for the four of you. Four! Go on! In one bed? It's all I have but I'm sure you'll be comfortable. Oh! But, I... I couldn't, I'd overcrowd you. No more than we'd crowd you. Go on! Never seen a lad so fastidious about a bed. Surely there must be a couch? We're comrades! The bed is for all of us. One for all and all for one! THEY LAUGH Perhaps Athos has never slept four in a bed. I'm accustomed to sleeping alone. Which we'll rectify tonight. That's the largest bed I ever saw. Oh, no. Oh! On the bed! Let me go! I'd rather sleep in the stables. With the animals? Athos, we'll cure you of this shyness. Enough of this nonsense, we've got to get to bed. Oh! Oh, no! I am Claire, the daughter of Athos. Now you've had your sport, messieurs, leave my room. Our room? My room, since we will not sleep four in a bed. Out you go, messieurs. Sweet Musketeer. Charming Musketeer. Beautiful Musketeer, let us in. Go to bed. Where? Oh, in the stable for all I care. Well, shall we join the horses? COCKEREL CROWS The question is what do we do with the wench? I make love to her. I make love to her. BOTH: WE make love to her. She wanted to be one of us, she wouldn't betray herself. Until it came to sleeping arrangements. A miserable night! What's that peculiar odour? Horses! Horses... We're not complaining. It's an improvement. Ah! Food! Good morning, messieurs. Madame. Good morning, mademoiselle. MEN: Good morning, Claire. Messieurs. I trust you slept well. My sleep was troubled with thoughts of you. I had the same thoughts but they didn't trouble me. HORSES OUTSIDE We're looking for grey-beards who may be riding this way. They're searching for our fathers. I'll give them a taste of my father's sword. It's time for strategy. You are my wife the Countess de la Frere. Why can't I be the husband? You are Viscount Patagrille. You are Viscount Gargantuan. Tell Pierre to saddle the horses. Let's sit down and act normal. Pardon, I have orders to search here. Identify yourselves, please. This is the Countess de la Frere and this is... Her husband, the Count de la Frere. And you? I am the Viscount Patagrille. The horses are ready, Count de la Frere. You said you were the husband. I am... He is my second husband and he was my first husband. You travel together? Why not? We're all broad-minded! Which one is the Count de la Frere? BOTH: I am. When I relinquished my wife I relinquished my title. A very generous deed. > You're lying. I want your true identity. In that case... D'Artagnan. Aramis. Porthos. And Claire the daughter of Athos. Seize them. Claire. I will not fight with a lady. I'm no lady when I fight. Are there any left? Two. Where? I put them to sleep. The Corporal's locked them in the cellar. Then, on to Paris. Put him in the cellar with the others. That will do. I'm fatigued and wish to rest. As Her Majesty wishes. Tell the Chamberlain I'll see no-one else today. Yes, madame. Dismiss these people. The Queen is too tired to see anyone. Mesdames and messieurs, you heard. COUNTESS: Your Grace. Any news of the Musketeers? No. My men are scouring the country. We're expected! It is impossible to see her today. Leave, or I shall call the guards. Beware of Her Majesty's anger when she knows how you treated us. Guards! Mademoiselle, how delighted I am to see you and how enchanting you look. Monsieur, I do not recall that we have met. You don't? You don't recall that night...? Oh, fickle is the heart of a woman. For me, each moment is a diamond enshrined in my heart. Monsieur, I have never seen you before. You haven't? No. All I can say is I regret it was not you. Your medicine, Your Majesty. I will not take it. You must, Mama. The Musketeers! Send them in. Her Majesty will see you now. Please go in. Your fathers could not come? The son of D'Artagnan, Your Majesty. Aramis. Porthos. And you? Claire, the daughter of Athos. We have prayed for your coming. You are our last hope. My children must be saved from Lavalle. It is dangerous. We'd be disappointed if it wasn't. If I close my eyes, I'd swear it was his father. When I die the Council of Nobles will make my daughter marry Lavalle. This must not happen. I despise him. Your Highness has excellent taste. If I could get the Princess to Spain, the King will protect her. Under the threat of war we'll compel the Council to reject Lavalle and recognise my son. From now on our lives and our swords will be devoted to that end. You don't know Lavalle, he is cruel and inhuman. I'm guarded constantly. Have you ever passed the gates? Only for my carriage ride. Six soldiers ride with me. < Six against three. An unequal contest. Do you forget me, Porthos? Six against four. My apologies, Claire. So much the worse for them. When's your next carriage ride? Tomorrow. Tomorrow you'll be abducted. Take care. Five of my messengers have gone to Spain and paid the penalty with their...lives... D'ARTAGNAN: Your Majesty! Mama! Summon Dr Fernand at once. Please call the doctor. Yes, Countess. Come closer. I do not know how many attacks I'll survive. If I die, my son is in the monastery at Les Foss. This is known only to ourselves. Guard this secret with your lives. Your secret is safe with us. Thank you for coming, I can't risk your life. Please, Your Majesty. Her sword is the equal of ours. Nevertheless, she must go home. It is my command. FOOTSTEPS You should be resting. Please be good enough to leave her. Thank you for coming. God ride with you. I've been searching for four old men! They intend to abduct her to Spain? But now we know... You'll stop them. No, I must be careful. Their names are still a legend in France. So, I'll permit them to abduct the Princess... but not to Spain. Good morning. Good morning, Claire. When do you start? We're awaiting word from Porthos. Is this where we say farewell? No, au revoir. I'll see you again...if I live. If you live? Whether I live or die matters? This is what I'd hoped for. You leap to conclusions. You do not care. I didn't say that. You care! Say it. I'll build an altar to every word. Careful, your husband is listening. I thought I could trust you. I shall have to divorce you. HORSES APPROACHING Porthos! There's relays of horses for 30 leagues, then... We'll improvise. Goodbye, my sweet, you'll always be one of us. Farewell, sweet Claire. Goodbye. Please, guard yourself well. Then you do care. I didn't say it because I couldn't. The words are in my heart. Let this speak for both of us. Goodbye, Pierre. GUNSHOT Rest easy, we're on our way to Spain. Look behind you. Come on! Are you all right, Your Highness? Cover the coach. Monsieur D'Artagnan. Lay down your arms. It's useless. If Your Highness commands. We yield. I am sorry, monsieur. We came in good time, to save you from these abductors. An act of treason for which the penalty is death. Are you ready to answer my questions? Yes. That's better. What would you like me to talk about? It's no time for flippancy. Where is the boy King? Still the same old question. And the answer? Still the same - I don't know. Garcon! METAL CREAKS Guards! Porthos, behind you. Porthos, look out! Bring in mademoiselle. Closer, see what the irons have done. Perhaps mademoiselle would like to spare you further torture. No, I won't tell. Very well, garcon! Hold her, you fool! Come on. You stood pain well. Let's see you face death. Each morning one of you will die. Tomorrow three will watch. The next morning two and then one. Perhaps someone will speak before then. DRUMROLL You'll get a better view over there. You are the first? We rolled the dice. He won. Magnificent. Never have I seen such luck(!) A moment, Captain, if you please. Au revoir my friends. We shall meet again. You are the bravest of all and the prettiest by far. Those brave young men. The law must take its course unless... Unless? It's in your hands to say whether they live or die. Your terms? Your consent to my immediate marriage to Her Highness. I see. You want the people to believe that it has my approval. Your Majesty is most intelligent as always. You only have a moment, madame. If I agree to the marriage, my Musketeers shall go free? You have my word. For what it is worth. I accept. I couldn't let you go, messieurs, without expressing my gratitude and to you, mademoiselle, thank you for risking your life for me. We shall regret unto our dying day that we were not of service to you. DOOR OPENS I hope you did not intend to leave without saying goodbye to me. Why, no and we wish to extend felicitations upon your marriage. Before you go, Her Majesty and I have gifts for you. Please come this way. Your Majesty. Majesty. Will the bride remove her veil? GASPS You! Madame. D'Artagnan, welcome, I wondered what... Oh, Your Highness. Corporal, admit no-one until after we leave. And we'll need boy's apparel for Her Highness. I'll find something. Good. Why boy's apparel? My father said, "Who hunts the eagle doesn't notice the sparrow." Follow me. Corporal, some of your good wine for a bad thirst. Please, sit down, monsieur. I know what is in your thoughts, monsieur. You were thinking of your lovely mademoiselle. Yes, I cannot help but fear for her fate. Yet you were willing to sacrifice her for me. We pledged to save you. There was no other way. Even so, I envy her. It's not been my fortune to share such devotion. BELLS RING The church bells only ring for celebrations or deaths. The Regent's Guards! No, I can keep them from entering. Stand away from the door. Oh, idiot! Why did you let those people go without paying? < If I left it to you we'd starve. < Imbecile! Oh, Captain, my husband sits on his brains. Three men and a woman and he... Did you say three men and a woman? Yes. Such a lady, one would have thought she was a princess. And then to run off without paying! When? Only a minute ago. They said they were the Queen's messengers. How can they be when there is no Queen? What do you say? No Queen? Hear those bells - the Queen is dead. Your Highness, you heard? Pierre, bring the horses. We would mourn but there's no time. Her Majesty said, "If I die, my son is at the monastery at Les Foss." Now, we dare not leave him behind. We must take him to Spain, without a moment's delay. You are right, monsieur. This is not the time for weeping. I am ready. Quick, put this on. Here, use this if you have to. Where are we going? There's a place in the country where you can hide. You have risked a lot for me, Countess. I am very grateful. The Queen would have asked it of me, had she lived. What news? The Musketeers and Her Highness have been captured. Then I'm the only one who can save the King. You know where His Majesty is hidden? Yes. The Queen confided it to us, when we pledged to aid her. What chance have you got against Lavalle? You can't reach him alone. Perhaps not, but nothing is going to stop me from trying. If my father were in my place he would not hesitate. He would go to the King at once, even if it meant his death. As his daughter I must act as he would. Perhaps together we might succeed. No, Claudine, it's too dangerous. You've risked your life for me once, I cannot let you do it again. It isn't for you that I make this offer but for the Queen, whose memory I hold dear. We must go, before Lavalle compels the Princess to reveal the King's hiding place. Do we go far? I must inform my coachmen and make arrangements. We travel the length of France to the monastery at Les Foss. Monastery at Les Foss. At last! Guards! They were hiding behind the skirts of the Church. Alert the border, no-one is to enter Spain. The monastery must be surrounded. No-one must enter or leave. Yes, my lord. We ride day and night. A toast to the master of all France. Aren't you a bit premature? As you say, but only a bit. Permit me. It's a woman's work. Ah, I'm an expert. If he cooks like he eats we'll have a feast. A feast! I swear I chased this rabbit when I was a boy. Respect his old age. I respect age, but not in cooked meat! HORSES APPROACHING Quick! The fire! Well, they've gone. So has our dinner. We must cross that bridge. I'll hold them off whilst you cross it. I'll hold them off, whilst you ride across. The suggestion was mine. I'll tell them. Aramis spoke first, let him be the one. At last! I can't believe we're here. It's been two years since I saw my brother. Can we go, monsieur? Guard the road, let no-one pass. Princess Henriette's come for the King. Her Highness? Take me to Father Leuvois. Gladly, you will find your brother happy and well. Put up your hands. It's a trap, save yourself. This is without my permission. I don't need anyone's permission. I promised the Queen. Take him away. Monsieur, I don't wish to go with you. Your place is in Paris, sire. I'd rather stay here. Come, we must go. Very well, but I won't sit by him. I must ask you to wait, monsieur. Porthos! Claire! I'm so glad to see you. Where are the others? At the monastery. How did you escape prison? Claudine said... Go on! We were trapped at the monastery. I know. The answer is here. Claire and the Countess! Darling, how did you escape Lavalle? The Countess helped me but it was a trick. YOU revealed the hiding place! She said you were captured. I thought only I could save the King. I should have died in prison! No, darling, even the Queen trusted her. At least we're together. If she tries further tricks, use it. Such a pretty mouth wasn't made for words! No, monsieur. Aramis! My friends! And my wife - in name only, confound it. We weren't sure we'd see you again. I nearly drowned! Claire, the tears I've wasted over you. You've already embraced her. Yes. Ah, Countess Claudine. The Countess is a traitor. She helped me escape, so I revealed the King's hiding place. Lavalle has the King? As prisoner. We will find him and when we do... What can you do against Lavalle and his troops? That remains to be seen. Bravely said. Your gallantry is wasted. The King won't live to reach Paris. Lavalle wouldn't dare! With the Queen dead, Lavalle will dare anything. Corporal! Corporal! Coming. Is there a place to hide this lady? There's a room in the cellar. Take her there. This way please. Why didn't you kill the witch? She may be of use. Hold her hostage and Lavalle... We must find Lavalle before it's too late to save the King. No, I won't sign. You are feverish, or you'd understand the need. I ask for the good of your people. France is near to revolution and you're in danger. This will make us a strong nation. I will not sign. Very well. I will leave Your Majesty to consider further. Please don't leave me in the dark. Please, I'm afraid! Your Majesty will have to choose. Such a simple thing to do, sire. Sign and you'll have a dozen candles. Your Majesty is wise. Now you must get well so you may dance at your sister's wedding. My lord looks pleased. Is it done? The signature is shaky, but it is the royal hand. This waiting will soon be over? In a few days. We must appear to have observed the necessary proprieties. That will convince the people of France that you did everything to aid the King to regain his health? Everything. I found His Majesty ill from neglect. He was unable to journey to Paris so I stopped at Laverne to wait for him to regain strength. But, alas, he was seized with a sudden attack from which he never recovered. Simple, artful and masterly. You'll have me weeping, the way you'll have all of France weeping. And Her Highness? Her Highness will be amenable. She fears contracting the same illness that befell her brother. More wine! More wine, madame! Yes, monsieur. Paulette! These girls, they hide whenever there is work to be done. Pssst! Pssst, Corporal. Paulette! You would not believe > Monsieur... Claire is in the cellar. Warn her. GUARD: The pretty one. The pretty ones are always tired. > GUARDS LAUGH Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle! Regent's guards. GUARD: To the Duke's health. > To the Duke! More wine, madame, more wine. Patience, monsieur. Paulette! Coming, madame. Coming. Paulette. Jacques drinks each glass as though it were his last. It may be my last. I'm taking no chances. Jacques was raised on a grapevine! More wine! Paulette! Where is that girl? Paulette! Coming. Where have you been? Take this wine to those gentlemen... With pleasure, madame. GUARDS LAUGH How do you do, messieurs? Well, what have we here? You're too pretty to be a tavern maid. You are too kind, monsieur. Oh, how strange! Huh? What's the matter? Forgive me, monsieur, I thought you were my sweetheart. The resemblance is remarkable. Well, in that case, mademoiselle, let me act like your sweetheart. Does your sweetheart kiss like that, mademoiselle? Oh, if my sweetheart kissed like that... I would never leave him out of my sight. Come on, time to leave. What? With a pretty wench in my lap and a glass of wine? Nevertheless. It's a long time since a wench has liked him. He can join us later. > Very well, but you have to go on duty by midnight. By midnight she'll believe I AM her sweetheart! Oh, you frighten me. Come along. So, no sooner is my back turned and I find you in the arms of another. Who's he? My husband. Husband! Why didn't you say you were married? You didn't ask me. I find you in the arms of another! Who's that? My sweetheart. I turn my back and... Find me in the arms of another. Who's that? My fiance. Husband, sweetheart, fiance - what is this? You'll find out. Walk to the rear. Did he talk? We couldn't stop him! The King is at the castle of Laverne. That's ten leagues away. He'll draw a map of the castle. Good. Not so good, the castle is impregnable. You go in and out - how? I was a guard to the courier. Courier? He goes to Paris each night. He has two guards. Lock him up. Courier and two guards, hey? We can get three men inside the castle but what good will that do? It would take 1,000 men to rescue the King. If there were 1,000 like you! 1,000! Yes, why not? Yes. There must be other sons of the Musketeers. How will we find them? There's Lafevre and Voisin. And Dufrey. They must know five or six others. INAUDIBLE Henri Lamont, er, Georges du Clau. Charles Vien, Alexandre Vierpot, Emile Gaudier. Porthos brought five. I've already lost count! Good, we're ready. Inform these men of their duties. We have a rendezvous in one hour. There's one more thing to be done. In the attack the King will be in danger. Some of us must go into the castle and guard him. How? By using the Countess as she used you. Oh! Sons of the Musketeers, this is what we've been waiting for - the future of France is in our hands. The honour of saving the King - and therefore France - has been bestowed upon us. To achieve this we have pledged our lives. I know you won't fail your fathers or your King. You know what is to be done - do it. God be with you. Goodbye, my darling. Good luck. Now to pick up our bait. So, monsieur, you've come to your senses. We have no alternative but to accept defeat and trust your word. In return for your freedom, Lavalle will grant us ours? Have no fear, he will grant this favour. HORSE APPROACHING They're coming! Get the courier's outfit for me. The Countess Claudine for the Duke. GUARD: Open the gates! How is the King? Better than he'll be tomorrow. He is too excited and has sent for his sister. He thinks we are leaving for Paris? Aren't we? Of course, WE are. GUARD: My Lord. Yes. The Countess is here. The Countess Claudine! Accompanied by D'Artagnan, Aramis and Porthos. What the devil? How did they find us? They'd never walk into our hands! Search them and arrange an escort. Yes, my lord. Have they been searched? Yes. Paul. Claudine. MUSKETEERS: Your Grace. Courier from Paris, open the gates. Keep our horses here, we ride back at once. Pretty trick. These men have plagued me. Take them out and hang them. The courier. Dispatches are urgent tonight. You! What is this? Resistance is useless. Guards! Guards! Palace is full of my men. Musketeers. We've kept them out of the palace. Good. The boy. We must get our men inside the palace. Pierre! Up here, Pierre. Guards, to the Duke at once. If you want your King alive, stand back. Hold! Let them pass. Your Majesty! Now, Your Grace, hide behind your sword. I'll have to dispose of you myself. Your Grace. The horses are ready. Claire. Aramis. Your Majesty. Your Highness. Louis. Long live the King! ALL: Long live the King! Subtitles by BBC - 2000
