Jeanne is a 83 year old woman. She lives alone in a flat near Paris, in Saint Ouen. She had love affairs when she was young, during the war. but nothing lasted, except for her loneliness. She doesn't want her loneliness to show, even though she's fine with it. Jeanne is walking on the street. She stops by shop windows. It's cold and the wind is blowing. So, she decides to go home. Listen. I saw your ad on the internet. I liked the pictures right away. I'm glad that your place looks just like in the pictures. I just graduated with a communications degree this summer. I'm looking for my first job so the room's low rent is really attractive to me. I'm a cool guy. I'm actively looking for a job right now. Don't freak out. I can pay the rent, at least for the first 4 months. Is this tea? Is it organic? Because I eat organic food only. If you don't, that's fine. We can eat veggie. We'll find solutions. I worked for a law firm. My pay was very good. I was harassed by my boss. So I left the company. The timing wasn't bad, I was tired of my job anyway. Since then, I have done a lot of internships, but it's hard to find a place to rent in Paris. Now I am studying in a pastry school. Hi. How are you? Maeva. She's helping me with the move. Alex and Clement, my new roommates. So... here's the gay apartment? So funny. Does it bother you? No. Sorry. That is not what I meant. She's a lesbian too. Let's hear it for lesbians, dykes, gays, transsexuals! Dykes? What's that? She just came out. She doesn't know much about our community. Me neither. We have so much to learn. You two are so cute. You remind me my younger days. One day, I found myself in... Oh my. 30's crisis. Stop him. SHE is going through her early menopause crisis. Come on. I just had my period. So you are new to our community... I've got a book called "Homosexuals for dummies." My sister Anne gave it to me last year. I'll go get it. No. I'll let you settle down. Why did you tell them I'm a lesbian? I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. Are you mad at me? No, but don't repeat it outside of this place. No. I just wanted you to be able to come here as you wish. Because you think they only have gay people over? I don't know. Are you sure you don't want to stay at my place? No. I've already bothered you for too long. You don't bother me at all... it is quite the opposite, well, I mean... It's weird. I didn't know how to look at them. I wasn't natural at all. It's simple. Look at them the way you look at me. OK Do you think they are really gay? Yes. Why? If I saw them in the street, I wouldn't be able to say. If you saw me in the street, how would you identify me? I couldn't find it. Never mind. Maybe you will find it later. Listen, we'll put my things in the bedroom. I can help if you want. Thanks, but Maeva is helping. Two is enough. Thanks. - She's cute. - Careful Alex. No touching! Hi Anne ! Seriously, when are you going to give me my keys back ? Say hello to your sister. Since you don't answer my phone calls, I'm here to see you. Hi Alex. - I haven't seen you for 2 months? - Yes. You know heterosexuals are not welcome here... France is a free country. You can't throw me out because of my sexuality. Anne, you are always welcome here. Thanks Alex. There's at least one normal person in this house. What do you want? You want to make an apple pie? Can you hear the way you talk to me? Alex and David are not like you. David knows how to talk to women. By the way, where is David? I need his advice since he's the leather specialist. Clement, may I borrow your husband? There's no more husband, no more David, no nothing. What? David found a job in Nantes. He's gone. When? - 2 months ago. - Why didn't anyone tell me? It's a shame. David was great. He left for Nantes? You don't split with someone because you find a job elsewhere. Clement. Can't you join him? What about my apartment? And my job? You can write your scripts from anywhere. I won't give up my life here because some guy wants to move to Nantes. 10 days before David! It's so good to see you. Oh my, look at these arms ! When I get bored, I work out. I'm single now. I have time. How about Nantes? Nothing to report. I'm trying to enjoy my single life. Are you ok? It's going pretty well. I have my own office, an assistant. I have a 9 to 5. Pretty cool. How about you? Well... Couldn't be better. I still work at the same restaurant. I do overtime but never get paid. Maybe I'll remain a waitress for the rest of my life? There is no such thing as a stupid job. Did you know you look beautiful with your wet hair? Don't you want to marry me, just for my wet hair? I'd love to but you know I'm not really free. No. I don't know. You left without warning, it really hurt. I'm really sorry but... I couldn't stay here any longer. He didn't need me here. And I wanted to leave Paris. The timing was good. You know, I've never been to Nantes. Maybe I might one day... move somewhere else. Why not? To start a new life, in a new city. Are you expecting anyone ? Yes. Someone is coming to visit your room. Maybe it's the one who'll replace you. Damn ! That's why Clement wanted me to empty my bedroom out this afternoon. Good evening. Are you also here for the room? - Leo, this is Alexandra. - Alex! She's been my roommate for 4 years. - And David... - Hi ! I'm here for the room too. We can't see it because the roommate doesn't want to give his key back. - Is there a problem? - No. Don't worry about it. Anyway, I've seen the pictures. It looks great. It works for me. You also have a terrace! Didn't I tell you? Well, let me show you. Well, let me show you! Come on... Isn't he cute? And...? Did you know that Clement only wanted gay or lesbian roommates? How surprising! - Why? Are you jealous? - Absolutely One year does count. I liked it when you were together. When we had coffee outside, on the terrace. That was cool. Now I'm alone in my big apartment. I can tell you: it feels weird. So? Honestly... It's great. I didn't expect that at all. Compared to all the apartments I visit that are in a bad shape in general, it's a nice change. For sure. With the owner living here and being a neat freak... Do you have questions? Yes. Do I need to fill out an application? No. 2 months deposit. That's all. I wanted to talk about that yesterday on the phone. I just arrived in Paris and I'm a bit tight moneywise... It's not much, though. - Too old to remember your student's life? - Come on. He's not that old. Thank you Miss! Let me remind you we are almost the same age. Do you know each other? No, not at all. - Alex, right? - Yes. - Do you have questions for me? I hate doing housework. Do you do any? Yes. I like washing dishes. It's relaxing. Too bad. There's a dishwasher. Do you smoke? Yes, but only when I go out or at parties. - I don't smoke. - Thank you for sharing. Really. Did I tell you about my job? I work for the city, in the pest control department. What's your mission exactly? Termites. I look for them in apartments. There's an upsurge of termites right now. Red termites, black termites, white termites, flying termites... It's horrible. Really? Are you done? How about you, Leo. What do you do? I study music. Cool. Do you rehearse at home? It can be pretty noisy, right? Less so than termites, actually. Where do you live now? At my girlfriend's place, near the Opera house. It's a 10 square meter studio, very small. - Posh neighborhood! - Life in a shoebox in Paris... Excuse me, did you just say you lived with your girlfriend? This room is only for gays, right?! She's a very good friend of mine. That's all. Honestly... Why are you looking for a gay roommate? Are you looking for a boyfriend at the same time? No, not at all. Too bad. Why? Because I like you a lot. Please... leave now. Never mind. I left a long time ago. And you, Leo? Do you have a certificate proving that you are gay? - Maybe you are not gay? - David, can you just leave him alone? Thank you anyway. Good night. - Will you answer me for the room too? - No, I don't think so. I need you to clean up your room, now. And don't forget to give your key back. Is that all you have to say to me? He is not irreplaceable. I can pick up my phone and find a guy in 10 minutes. It's not the same thing. I've been looking for a man for almost 40 years and I can't find one. I don't know how it works anymore. I'm tired of being single. Hello, young man. Here's Leo, our new roommate. Leo, my sister Anne. Be careful, she's sexually frustrated. - Cut it out or I'll go. - Go ahead, please. - Anne - Maeva Are you two together? Finally I'm not the only heterosexual in this place. Excuse me, I'm a dyke. Where are you coming from? You can say "tu" to me. I live in the suburbs. I get bored on Sundays, so I come to see my sulking little brother. You don't only get bored on Sundays. Forget it. He's been cranky all day. Me too. My cat disappeared a few days ago. I’m sure those Chinese guys on the third floor ate him. - Can I have a cigarette? - Yes, of course. - You are charming. - Really? Thanks. You remind me of the naked models when I was in fine art school. I don’t paint living models anymore. Why ? I prefer still lifes. I find them comforting. And I will never fall in love with a basket of plastic fruits. If you ever change your mind, I can pose for you. - Why not? - But I’ll be dressed. Lentils. - Great. - Don’t you have something else? I love lentils. Do you want me to sort them out? What ? I used to sort out the stones with my grandma. In that case, I’d love to do it with you. I don’t know. It’s complicated. I think my professor doesn’t really like me. Maybe I’m not talented enough... You can’t say that. Don’t let him treat you this way. Talent is a matter of motivation, success and perseverance. I worked hard to get where I am today with my painting I'm not a genius but I earn my living from my passion. I paint murals and store fronts for restaurants. I teach children. I like it. If you don’t believe in yourself, nobody will for you. You have to persevere. Always, always, always. It’s important. I can imagine you giving lessons to children. I love it. I love children. How I wish they were mine. You will probably have your own one day. They found lentils in Egyptian graves from 8000 years ago. There are several varieties of lentils. Red, green, yellow, orange... You might think that I’m trying to show off but I’m not. I just translated an article for a publisher. Which one do you prefer? The pink lentil of Champagne. Their color is so beautiful and they come from my region. I’ve never met someone who comes from your region. Now you have a friend from Champagne. Clement is a good guy. He’s a pain sometimes, but he can be very sweet and nice. We went through a lot together and he was always there for me. Anne. What are you talking about? Nothing. Stop or you’ll scare him. I’ll go get some bread. No, I’ll get it. What are you doing? Keep your money. I’m fine, but... I live in a tiny studio. Yes, he told us. It's about 12 square meters. It’s really tiny. I hope I can graduate soon so I can earn a good living and live in a big apartment like this one. We are very lucky. Look at the terrace... That’s why Clement chose it. It’s a luxury. You can’t imagine the parties we throw here. Yes, I do. It must be awesome. I’m sorry. She must have thought that we are together. Don’t worry. I don’t mind. I just can’t get rid of her. She’s like a cold in winter: she keeps coming and going. What a pain! - Has she always been alone? - No, she lives with a cat. Done! It’s not fair. I talked all the time. Look. You missed some. Here. 2 hours earlier Are you ok? Weren’t you supposed to go to the movies this morning? Yes but I couldn’t wake up on time. Are you OK, Alex? Yes, I’m fine. Really? I’m always fine. Alex, why you never share anything with me? You never talk about yourself. Try a little bit. Come on, Clement. When you grew up in the middle of nowhere and your parents are homophobic, you decide to hide and say nothing. And you lie. It’s not easy to... to break the habit now. Jeanne is walking on the street, stops by shop windows. It’s cold and the wind is blowing. Hi Leo. Leo? Hi Anne Is Clement here? He’s having dinner with his producer. How are you? What’s in the box? Let me show you. My father was in the navy. He spent most of his life traveling. I don’t know him. He had lots of women in his life but he never wanted to settle down... until the last one. I was raised by my mom. Clement was raised by his. Hold on, this one is upside down... When I was 12, my mom decided to help Clement’s mother who was very sick. She welcomed them to live with us. We built a family in our own way. Why do you want to show these pictures to Clement? My father’s house has been sold. My step-mother was kind enough to tell me before throwing everything away. I don’t know why I took all these slides... Memories of my dad. Clement would have loved to travel with him when he was young. It's weird to see all these pictures. It was my father’s life but I don’t know it at all. What are you doing? We're looking at your father’s slides. What’s this shit? Why did you bring this to my house? - Leave me alone, please. - Are you sure? You’re ugly when you cry. Stop it. I’m not in the mood. Why are you always so mean to me? It’s because I remind you of all your sorrows? Let me say it just for once and for all. Why don’t you let people love you? What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of bringing us bad luck? If your mom died, it was not your fault. If Jeremy died, it was not your fault. If our father decided to ignore us all his life, it's not your fault either. OK? Are you ok? Cigarette? How was the meeting with your producer? Forget it. He wanted to stop working with me. We’d been working together for 5 years. Such a waste of time. Damn, I’m sorry for you. Don’t be sorry. It’s not your fault. I don’t know if I want to continue. You still don’t want to show me your movies? Are they all that bad? I can tell you their stories if you want. OK. Why not? I shot my first movie when I was 20. I used film at the time, can you imagine? It was called « Crazy Massicot ». I never finished it. What's « Crazy Massicot »? Jeremy wrote the script. He was my boyfriend at that time. He had imagined the story of an old police inspector called Massicot. Massicot goes to the south of France to investigate a crime with his young partner. A hitch hicker was murdered and his body was found behind a gas station. When Massicot and his partner arrive there, the corpse is gone. Disappeared. At the end, we find out that... Massicot is actually a patient in a psychiatric hospital. The whole story was a figment of his imagination. Your story sounds weird indeed. I was young, I was a lousy director. And Jeremy, was a beginner too. What has become of Jeremy? He couldn’t continue in the movie business. And me, the bad director, is still going. 2 months later I thought you were going home for Christmas? Alex decided to throw a surprise party tonight for your birthday. So I... OK... Alex will kill me... I’ll pretend that I don’t know. Thanks Clement. I’m going to take a shower. What brings you here? Happy birthday. Thanks. I didn’t think you’d remember. I kind of did. Are you back in Paris for the holidays? Yes. I’m here until January 2nd and then I’ll go back to Nantes. Do you want to come in? We’re having a small party for my birthday. No. I can’t. I’m very badly parked and someone’s waiting for me in the car. OK. No problem. Have you been together long? No... it’s nothing serious. We’ll see how it goes. Is he cute? Not as cute as your new roommate. How are things going with him? Good. Very good. I have to go. Keep in touch? I know for tonight. You suck, guys! No big deal! Have you invited Maeva? No. She’s not answering me. We had coffee together two weeks ago and since then... nothing. She’s still young. And confused. No. I think it’s mostly because I’m not her type. Same here. I think I’m not Leo’s type either. It’s probably better that way anyway. If she came here more often, we’d get the chance to talk to each other... And she’d see that I’m not that bad. You can’t ask for the sun and the moon at the same time. You already have your half naked sun walking around in the living room. I’m still waiting for my moonlight to warm me up at night. Come on! We’ve run out of hot water! What did I just say? I didn’t know that you played guitar?! Not really... Can you show me later? I’ll make some coffee. No. I’ll do it. So, will you show me? No. It’s embarrassing. Why? Do you want me to play with you ? Maybe you’ll feel more confortable. How can we do that? Never done that before? That’s what we did in high school to pick up girls. Give me the guitar. You do this. OK? Keep the chord. First string. Then strum the next five. - I can’t do it. - Give me your hand... You have big hands. It’s easy. First string. Then strum the next five. Am I interrupting you guys? Anne, seriously, didn’t you give my keys back last time? Yes, but I had a copy made. Well, I’ll get dressed. The good times never last long enough. That’s what I thought about when I saw you. I didn't have a choice. Alex organised a surprise party for your birthday... I’m sorry. That’s ok. Come on. Let’s have coffee. No. Stop talking shit. I what? OK. Go ahead. I’m listening. I’ve explained this to you a thousand times... Shut up. You piss me off. I’m not coming tonight, ok ? Hello ?! Is she serious? - Croissants, pain au chocolat... - That’s too much. It’s not cold today. Would you like some orange? Yes, please. No sugar for you, right? Great memory! You’re just like David, but younger. Stop it. Leo is Leo. David is David. - Who's David? - His ex-boyfriend. The old guy who was there when I came visiting? He’s not that old. We are the same age. The good thing about David is that he’s got a very healthy lifestyle. He gave me lots of advice on my diet. - Stop with your diet. - Honestly you don’t need that. Diets are for women. Maeva was always on a diet. Do you have news from Maeva? No. Not at all. She has been avoiding me for several days. Is it my fault? No. Why? We were the best friends in the world. And without warning, she decided not to talk to me anymore. I don’t understand women. They are so strange. I couldn’t agree more. Anyone? It flows in all directions. It’s Maeva. Are you ok? I haven’t heard from you in 2 weeks. Are you kidding? Who didn’t want to see me for two weeks? The situation is a little complicated, don’t you see? What’s complicated? Don’t you understand? Or do you refuse to understand? - Maeva, you know I like you. - But? But you know... It’s complicated. I like it when things are clear and go fast. You just can’t skip the stages, Alex. I hardly kissed her. Lucky you! Nobody has kissed me for ages. Me neither. I thought you were with Leo. No. Nothing happened between us. Not yet. Stop! So, you really are a fag. Perfectly disguised as a heterosexual but you really are a fag. I thought it was just a phase, it would pass. And I’d be there for you when you’re done. I had a bad feeling about this apartment. What is it about Clement, Alex and others? What are you talking about? You all are different, OK? - I love you all, right? - Difficult to choose? You are such a liar. Are you ok? No, not at all. What's wrong? Let's just... Please, Alex, stay. You’re having a party tonight, right? - Yes, it’s Clement’s birthday. - Happy birthday. Thank you. Of course you are more than welcome. I can’t stay because my parents are in Paris. We had planned to go to a restaurant with Leo. - That's too bad. - Leo, you should've told us. We can have a party some othe time. I never said that I would come. You never said no either. - Yes I did. - No you didn’t. Come on... Maybe it’s not that complicated... Since everybody’s here, we’ll throw Clement’s birthday party now. OK? Then Leo can have dinner with your family. What do you think? OK but we’re not ready. Let's buy some drinks and we’ll chill out. I want to have some fun. Who is going grocery shopping then? I’ll go with Leo. Take a bottle of champagne. Leo, are you coming? Sorry but I won’t come tonight. - Do you want to drink something? - No, thanks. You can come here anytime, you know. We’d like to see you more often here. Right, Alex? Yes. Well, I don’t come here often because... Because? Because I don’t like to see Leo suffer. Wait. What are you talking about? I can't tell you. I understand but consider yourself at home here. He’s in love with you. What? - You are talking about Leo ? - Yes. I know he looks very confident, but in reality he’s very shy. When we talk about love, he shies away. Paralyzed. That’s why he’s still single. I don’t have the same impression. He is very open-minded and easy-going. He always speaks out. I agree with you. Are you sure about that? Are you in love with Leo? Are YOU in love with Alex? Come on! If I have to tell the truth, I’m sorry, Alex, I became straight again a few days ago. I thought heterosexuals were not allowed here? Come on. My sister Anne is straight and I don’t kick her out. So why don’t you want to rent the room to a heterosexual? I don’t know. I never think about it, really. I always lived with gays. You’re right. I never wondered why. Maybe it’s my way to protect myself. Imagine you come across an ad that says: "Only for heterosexuals." - How does that make you feel? - Bad. Very bad. You have to be fascist to do something like that. Why are you freaking out? How can you do your coming-out like that? - For fun. - Are you having fun? You could’ve spared me the false hope. Are you kidding me? I’m the one who should apologize now? I wasn't the one who made a move on you after only 5 minutes. - It was insane. -Exactly. You should’ve told me. I was charmed. I kissed you because you were beautiful and sweet. And I just couldn’t resist. You think I’m pretty? I swear I never did something like that before. Aren’t you in the kitchen? Let’s drink! Pop the champagne, guys! - Shit. We forgot the champagne. - Totally. We were chatting and... Well, we have sparkling water... Leo, I’ve told Clement everything. Fuck. - Did we miss anything? - No, Anne. Leo, what is going on? Wait, Clement. What did she say? Do you need evidence? What do I have to do to prove myself right? Nothing. You can’t control your desire. I can make an effort. I want to live here with you, with Alex. I feel good here. Don’t kick me out, please. Wait, Leo. Nobody wants you to leave. I can show you. Oh! What are you doing? I’d better go. Maeva. What is this all about? You still don’t understand? Leo pretended he was gay to get this room. And so did I. He’s never been in love with me? And you never liked girls? - If the day comes, I’ll let you know. - Thanks. Very kind of you. Life is probably easier when you are a lesbian. Why did you make up all that shit? Because I was in love. It’s dumb. She’s right. Maybe it’s easier to find true love if you’re a lesbian. Well. Just ask Alex. Why did you do that? I'm sorry. I know it sucks. I shouldn’t have done that. I didn’t want to lie to you. I thought it was more believable. Believable? You know I don’t care if you are gay or not. I have never had a brother or a sister. You have treated me like family. That’s why I like to live here. I liked it. Having a gay brother and a lesbian sister, is that ok for you? It's funny. Don’t you do it anymore. - Do you have a room left for me here? - No. Forget it. I hate you for being so frank with me. You’d better be. A little bit of honesty feels good, doesn’t it? It’s my birthday. Let’s play a game I love... - Truth or dare. - No ! Ok everyone? Leo, can you give me a hand? - Do we even have a choice? - No. I hate this game. Because I’m not interested in people’s private life. You’ve always bought celebrity magazines before taking a train. It’s different. I do that to kill time. Let’s have fun. I’m 32 today! Go ahead. Tell us about your life. We’re listening. I don’t know how to start. Actually, I have been wondering... you bought this apartment with your father’s inheritance, right? why do you need roommates? You don’t really need... OK. That’s a good question. So? - I don’t like to live by myself. - You could've lived with me. When Jeremy died, I really didn’t feel like living with you. 8 years ago, when he passed away, I promised myself I would never fall in love again. I preferred living alone at the time. But I realized soon after I would never forget him. When I had the opportunity to buy this place, I felt like having roommates right away, so I wouldn't be alone. That’s when I started dating again. I met a few nice guys but it felt like betraying Jeremy. Now, I feel something new in me. I can move on. I can feel it. Is that why you didn’t want to try out our little Leo? - Probably. - You can still try. Stop it. You are going to scare him. Alex and I will end up living here by ourselves like two monks. Speak for yourself. Oh yeah? Are you hiding something from us? Come on, Alex. Go ahead! I’ve been dating a woman for 5 years... And she’s going to marry her boyfriend. No way?! Yes. I didn’t tell anyone. When I kissed Maeva, I was leaving her because I was tired of this story. I was suffering so much. Anyway it doesn't matter. Maeva is not the right person either. I need to move on. You could’ve told me. I knew it wouldn’t work out anyway. That’s why I didn’t tell you. You always look so happy in this house. Do you really know me? I’m just a stupid, pathetic and grumpy little girl... And bitchy. Yes, bitchy too. who hides in her room to cry. Come on! We are here to celebrate a birthday. 32 years old! Can you imagine? Yes, I do. Come on Clement. You look younger than your age. - And me? - Even younger! Thank you Leo, nice of you. I know that soon I will look my age... It feels good to share... Your turn. I’ve found my cat! Titi is back! He was with the Chinese family and they didn’t eat him. They were very nice but I didn’t understand a thing they said... - What an exciting life... - Exciting... Don’t you have anything more interesting to share? I’ve decided to stop looking for love. Why? Because I’m tired of spending my time on social media. It won’t work anyway. Men my age are looking for younger women. At some point, I have to face reality. I’m already too old. I always felt empty inside and I don’t want to feel that anymore. My heart is for no one now because I have a new project. - What project? - I am moving to India. I don’t know yet for how long... I’m tired of painting restaurant’s murals and giving drawing lessons. I just want to paint for myself. Why didn’t you tell me? Have you ever been interested in my life? Clement, don’t take it personally... Leo. Do you have anything juicy to tell after all this excitement? No... Enough revelations! Can I speak honestly without being judged? Even if I have lied to you since the beginning? Talk freely. Don’t hesitate. I didn’t talk until now because nobody would have believed me. But now, it’s impossible to keep it for myself. Come on! Spit it out! Well... Anne, I’m in love with you. Hi! Sorry for coming without notice. What brings you here? I saw Leo 2 days ago. - Their place is nice. - Awesome. And... He told me that you were looking for a new roommate. So I thought maybe... I should take a chance. What makes you think you are the best candidate, Miss? The best candidate? I don’t know. What makes you think you are better than the other ones? I have an advantage over the others. Because I know you already a little bit. And I’d like to know you more. And I cook well... Housework is not a problem for me. I’m a happy person even though it has not been obvious so far, I guess. That’s true. And... I feel alone in my tiny studio. Since the last person who lived in that room found love, there are probably good vibes in there. I thought it might turn out the same way for me. Yes. That’s a good point. Me too. I think it’s a good point. In that case, maybe I should take Leo’s room. Then I can find the right girl as soon as possible. At Jeanne’s place, the young man eats a soup with her. Jeanne watches him eat. He looks relaxed. He looks around, noticing a few framed pictures. Jeanne hands him the pictures. They are pictures of herself when she was young. On the pictures, she looks his age. The young man follows her to the bathroom. She fills a bath. It feels a little awkward for both of them. Jeanne walks to the bathroom door. She knocks at the door. She listens. She hesitates. Then she enters the bathroom. Jeanne washes the young man’s hair, as if she was washing her grandson’s hair. Jeanne has tea with the young man in the kitchen. They listen to music. She watches him carefully his hair his eyebrows his eyes his nose his mouth his neck his chest Suddenly, she stands up. She turns the music off, says good night and goes to her bedroom. Jeanne gets undressed. She puts moisturizer on her face and puts on her pajamas. All of a sudden, Jeanne turns into a 25 year old woman. She is the 25 year old version of herself. The horses have disappeared. They are now replaced by the shadow of a young man moving towards her. The shadow turns into a body, a real body. Jeanne is moved to see him. Jeanne suddenly wakes up in her bed. She is still 25 years old. It feels as if... she was waking up from a dream.
