Am I in it? Of course you're in it, darling, cos you are my oldest, oldest friend. Mmm-hmm. And who will play me, Eddy? Well, darling, it's only just, like...nearly a book. It will be a film, though, sweetheart, because it's about me, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, it's about London's premier fashion PR. Yeah. Fabulous. And who will play me, Eddy? Not Jane Fonda. Why? I've had stem cells and the blood of a two-year-old child injected into my skin, and my face still looks like this. You need to be using foetus blood, Eddy. A little spritz of afterbirth, darling. Mm. Keep up, sweetie. Oh... I want to go in there, but I have to go past that big mirror. I think I am now officially fatter sideways than I am front on, darling. Darling, you don't need those. I am your mirror. How do I look? Fabulous. Thank you. Ooh. Need to move that, Eddy. Yeah, I'll call Kelly Hoppen. Fabulous. Morning. Afternoon. Oh, when did these stairs get so long? Since you dug into Middle Earth. Oh, yes. Good though, isn't it? Look at that. Bo and Marshall rang. What, both of them? Yes, they want to come and talk about the house. Why do they want to come and talk about the house? I don't know. Go outside! Eddy, I'm vaping! No, no, darling, you lit it, you lit it. That's a cigarette. And she's a child! Well, then why can't she go outside into the air? Your mother's here. Oh, Christ. Anyway, how long is this one here for? When's she going back? I don't know, darling. All I know is it's something else I'm paying for. I'm not going back to Africa. If Dad wants to see me, he can come here. Well, why isn't he paying for her? Mum, we're divorced. Yeah, well, he can't just sit in Ebola or wherever it is he is, darling, and not pay for her. Gabon? What...what? Gabon? Gabon? Why is she saying Gabon? Why are you saying Gabon, darling? Is he still in Gabon? Is he still in Gabon? No. No! No. Dad's paying for me. What? He gave me a credit card. Oh! Oh, oh, oh. Talking about credit cards. Bubble? All of my cards are broken. Fix them, please. Eddy, I'm thirsty. Morning, Mrs M. Morning, Patsy, dear. I'll open up a Bolly. SHE GASPS Darling, where is the champagne? I don't know. Darling, where's the Bolly? Where's the champagne? If you want things, you have to pay for them. Since when?! Sounds as though you're going to have to tighten your belt, dear. Oh. If you manage that, it'll be a first. Don't let her eat anything, darling, while she's here. All right? No eaty. Eddy, what are we going to do about the champagne? BUZZER RINGS That'll be Bo and Marshall. BO: Hi, hi, hi. MARSHALL: Hello, there. Well, no need to rush, honey. Now, be careful. All of this is new. Hello, everybody. Oh, hello, there. Let's get up here, one, two, three. Oh. OK. Now, tell her why we're here. I can't go on with the house payments. You've paid for all this? Well, darling, that's how divorce works. Learn. He needs surgery. Oh. That's right. We can tell them. Marshall is a transgender. He'd like to live life as a woman. Oh, that's typical, isn't it? Jumping on the bandwagon. Finally she gets to cut your balls off! Oh, well, I tell you something, I don't need your measly payments. I've got a book deal. Mm-hmm! Come on, Pats. Well, at least you're small. You'll be able to get shoes. So when does it come off? Oh, no, we haven't gone through "coming off" therapy yet. Darling, I want you to come with me today because I'm putting the final touches to the Huki Muki retrospective launch party. Can Lulu sing at that? No. Oh, no, no, no, no, that's all got to go back. That's all got to go back. Eddy, how long have we got this for? Oh, well, they've actually lent it for Emma Bunton, but they don't mind. They're fine. BUBBLES: No, they want it back! Exercise, exercise, exercise... Done! RADIO: And coming up today on Woman's Hour, was Shakespeare's wife depressed? But first, here in the studio we have PR supremo Claudia Bing, a woman with her finger on the pulse. Oh, turn that shit off. I mean, there was a time the zeitgeist blew through me. Now, it's just... A tiny fart. Pff! Eddy, look. Quite close by. Ooh. No, I'm all right. All right. EDDY SIGHS Had him, had him, had him, had him... Eddy, can we stop off at the Wolseley? No, darling, my cards are broken. Chiltern Firehouse? My cards are broken! Well, haven't you got any of that... What? ..hand money? No! What's that? Chanel No 5. No, darling, I'm fine. Marshall, show them your breasts. No! Oh, come on. Leave it, Bo. Women, you can't live with 'em, you can't live... SHE GASPS Is this little Lola? Oh. Africa. We are sisters. My people are your people. Which people? Black people. I am a black person. Deep down, we are all black. Oh. So... ..can I have an advance? Ha. No. What is this? I just don't get it. Well, this isn't how it would be written. This is... This is how I dictated it to Bubble. Bubble. What is Bubble? My PA, Bubble. SHE GIGGLES Oh, I thought it was new software. So, you see, I'm just not really understanding anything you say. I need a coffee. Coffee! I mean, the world of PR. Mmm. Who really knows what PR is? PR is everything. I am PR. I mean, I took Sting, put him in the rainforest, gave the little pygmies a party. I put Bono behind yellow glasses. I gave celebrities AIDS. The T-shirt. Anyway, look... There's not enough here. What do you mean, not enough? There's pages and pages of it. I dictated it to Bubble. It mostly just says, "Blah, blah, blah." Who do you represent in PR? Well, it's not just the "who's", it's the "what's". It's the likes of... Not the "likes of", the "actuals". The singer Lulu. And who else? Spice Emma, Baby Bunton. And? Queen Noor. Well, I have a huge boutique vodka. I have Pop-Specs. Joel. Graham! Graham! Graham, no, I...I know you. I know him. He loves me. I don't love you. You're gay, come on! Look, I don't love you! Leave me alone. I don't know what's the matter with him. I mean, all my friends are gay. And Nigella! Yes. I know Nigella. What about a chapter on that? You know, me and Nigella, eating late at night... ..in a fridge. No. Can I have an advance? No. Why? Because it's shit. KNOCK ON GLASS Eddy, let's go. I'll be late. You only read 'em, you know. You don't write 'em. You just work in the shop. You think your life's interesting. It isn't. It may be worth living, but it's not worth reading. It's happened. Move on. SHE BLOWS A RASPBERRY Bloody, bloody books! Bloody books! Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! Bloody books! I have to check the Huki Muki mannequins before tonight. Coming with me, Eds? No, no, no, I can't come with you. I've got the PR persons lunch-of-the-month lunch. Brunch. Well, the PR persons munch-of-the-munch munch. Not munch. Lunch. Oh, kill her, Eddy. What are we going to? Have you rung Lulu yet? Oh, shut up about Lulu. Don't rush me. No, I haven't got any money. Get someone to pay at the other end. Where's my car? It's gone back to Baby Bunton. But I need wheels! Oh! But you were only given feet. Shut up, shut up. Yeah. Love. Love. Hate. Put the fishtail next to the red blob. And change that mannequin, it's too fat. Why are we doing this by the river? Seriously, it stinks of fish. Is that you? Good grief. What's the food? All raw. Freshly dead, octopus with a pulse? Yeah. Cocktails? The mixologist is Madeira Slice. Yeah. He's doing his flaming gasoline herbal labia cocktails. No olives. No olives. No. Oh, Metro wants a paragraph, Patsy. Yeah. Oh, Patsy Stone, fashion editor, The A.

Well, we have got all the Jenners and Tyga, Suki, Cara, David, Kanye. We've got Dolce, but not Gabbana, OK, SamCam, I don't know who... Ai Wuhwuh... Ai Weiwuh... Weiwie... Am I going deaf, or have you not spoken the words "Kate Moss" yet? Right, I'm so sorry, but apart from the fact that me head's full of fish fumes, it's just bloody impossible because she's left her PR. I shouldn't have said that, that's secret. Delete, delete! I don't care. Just get her here. Right. Offer her ayahuasca and shamans and enough vodka to kill cattle. OK. I'm off to Chanel. Lagerfeld waits for no man. Get me an Uber. A minicab? Helicopter! Course. I don't do traffic! Yeah. Bag. Chanel, Chanel! I can't bloody work with that shit! Hi, welcome, everybody, to this month's PR person-of-the-month lunch. Eat. It's all free.

Shooting out on Twitter, and joining up all those conversations. We have begun... Do we do that? No. Who knew that a blog post could do more than a banner or cookie engagement? Do you feed my Twitter? No, I forgot. And it died. Mash up social data and evaluate successfulness. I don't have to list our clients, I'm sure you're aware. These days, you can't get by with a couple of old pop stars and a vodka. LAUGHTER It's a boutique vodka! It's a huge boutique vodka! PHONE RINGS PATSY, ON SPEAKER: Eddy! Top secret, darling.

I can't believe that face came from the womb of the little dumpster. Excuse me? Tonight, Lola, you are my perfect accessory. Oh, she won't need much, darling. If raw material was the finished article, there'd be no point of me. I'm going to straighten and shimmer. Ow! Ow! Go for it. Just take the pain, bitch. Your hair will straighten. Ow!

Claudia Bing, an incredible woman. You know, Richard, you really can't go wrong with Chanel. I've been a big fan of Karl's for so many years, and I love what he does. And glasses off.

No. Just looking for Kate. # He wants to pounce... # You're joking. # Never know if he's giving you up # Are you just not good enough? # Lulu, my darling, I thought you were singing tonight. That's what I was told. Do you know what? She's done this to me before, as well. Oi! You. You told Lulu this was her gig! You know what, darling?

Yeah, but you were a very big 15, sweetheart. I want you to go over there and just, like, talk to her casually, all right? And then what? Well, then I'm going to come over and join you, and she'll think I'm cool, and, you know, before you know it, I'll be doing her PR, darling. That's the plan? Yeah. Jesus. I can't believe you're still, uh... ..alive. Can I offer you a little taste of something now? No. Oh, come on, Jonny, come on, Jonny, come on. No, thank you. No. No. You took my virginity.

Edina Monsoon! Oh! GASPS Kate! Why did you do that?! She fell. You pushed her. No, she fell! I saw you! Kate Moss has been pushed! ALARMED HUBBUB Kate! Kate! Kate Moss! Hold on. I'll go in! You are not going in! Put your jacket straight back on! Eddy! She'll pop up! It's only water! Someone call the police! It's just water, I mean, why isn't she popping up?! Kate! Eddy, why did you do this? I didn't do it! Why did you do this, Eddy? She just fell! Eddy, this is my party! I've got a limp and I don't even know why. Get them all down, right? I don't want to see anything on camera. Right, the only thing is... NOW! OK, OK. I fucking hate parties. I fucking hate handbags! HE MUTTERS Oh! Me leg. Good Lord. Magda! Selfie, Magda! Fuck off! Get them off. That woman has always been a liability, always out of control! Kate was trying to get away from her. I was shocked. I saw it happen. She was pushed. Did I miss something? This is the scene here, where, just a few hours ago, the celebrated international model Kate Moss fell or was pushed from a balcony over here, down into the Thames. Since then, the emergency services say they have been struggling to cope with the aftermath. HE SHRIEKS SHE SOBS It's my little toe! She fell off her shoe. Looking for Kate! Get back. One more dance. Baby, please. I'm OK. I didn't fall in the river. I'm OK. DOOR OPENS Shut up! You shut up! How bad can this be? I mean, you know. You have probably killed Kate Moss. Shit. Spoilt your night out? That doesn't matter. I shouldn't have let you go. I don't know what I was thinking. She'll be all right, won't she? Kate, Kate, you know, she's waterproof. That's what we always say about Kate, she's waterproof. I demand to see your superior! That would be me. Nick?! This is Detective Inspector Nick... We know each other, thank you. God. Don't. Yeah. Hello, hello? Have they found Kate? No. No. The currents are very strong. Only an outside chance... Yes, thank you. She will either have drowned or will just be very, very wet. In the meantime, you're here for your own safety. There's a very well-coordinated lynch mob outside. What happens now? Well, I don't think this has to change anything between us. No, about this! Oh. I have witnesses to say that your mother pushed her. No! I didn't want her to die! No, she needed her! Loved her! We don't know that she's dead yet. Or even that it isn't murder. Murder?! Thank you. Manslaughter charges might be brought. Sorry. Oh, God. Police continue to search the Thames after fashion icon Kate Moss fell from a balcony at a Huki Muki... NEWS REPORTS IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES OVERLAP EACH OTHER There is a real sense here now of devastation. Local people, friends, eyewitnesses are in disbelief. They are reluctant to leave the banks of the Thames while any faint hope remains of Kate Moss being found alive. We're expecting the police to hold a news conference to give us the latest information they have about this incident. Now, back to the studio. And some breaking news for you. The PR guru Edina Monsoon, the woman at the heart of a police investigation, has returned to her West London home. EDDY: Don't drive off until I'm in the house! Oi! Oi! REPORTERS: Edina! Edina, over here! Edina! Stop hounding me! I'm not an animal! REPORTERS SHOUT QUESTIONS TEARFULLY: She was, like, someone that I...I really looked up to. She wouldn't give a fuck what we think. No! Devastated. I'm so confused. Is there really nothing else happening in the world? Fashion is dead. Oh! What? Oh! OMG. What, darling? You're trending on Twitter. Am I? You're a hashtag. Oh. Oh! Oh, no. Oh, no, this is horrible. What? Disgusting. Oh! Oh, they hate you! Who? Who? Well, well. Oh, here she is. Here she is. The fat woman! Yeah, just do the toes. Your fat little toes? Your fat little celebrity toes? Yeah, yeah. Right. Fat woman kills thin woman. You don't know anything! It was an accident! Nothing about you is an accident. May I suggest... ..Fat Pink? What are you doing? Oh, here we go. Just doing my...this is my therapy, sweetheart. When are you going to, just for one moment, take in the enormity of what has happened? When are you just going to stop rolling through life, wanting more and more? Look at this house. Nobody needs a house this big! I do. You see? Even your house is fat. Well, I'm on a diet. You're always on a diet, Mum, but you're always fat. Mmm-hmm. Because you never stop eating! Mmm-hmm. Now, will you please just stop for one second and look at what you've done? Yes. Oh, I love that girl. Your death threats, m'lady. # Like a bird # On the wire # Like a drunk in a midnight choir... # Now everybody bloody hates you! Stupid bloody drunk! You mucky bitch. You filthy scunner! You make me sick. # Like a worm on a hook... # I'm innocent, yes. It's Patsy Stone. But I am innocent. I'm innocent. Excuse me, guys. I'm the victim here. I'm Patsy Stone, but I am innocent. That's it, Patsy, lovely. Thank you, darling. # To be free. # Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Thursday. Can you just shut up, please, darling? Cos I'm trying to do my Mindlessness. I'm being trollied on Twitter. Oh. Everybody hates me. When I was coming in earlier, a woman screamed at me, darling. What did she say? She told me I was a pariah. Do you know what a pariah is? It's a fish. DOOR OPENS That's right. Flash, flash, flash. Flash for Patsy. Patsy, flash, flash, flash. Ugh, Eddy. You killed Kate Moss! I've lost my job because of you! And now I am nothing, as well. GLASS SMASHES FOOTSTEPS RUN AWAY It's from Stella McCartney. How many "Om"s have I given you? How much money have I given you? Where is my enlightenment? Where is my nirvana, you stupid, blue, buggering Buddha! Om... Om... Ba-ding-ding-ding-ding, cha... Om... Ba-ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-cha... Om... Oh. Sorry you lost your job, darling. You're not nothing. Cheers, thanks a lot. It's the first thing I've ever had from Stella. Oh, Eddy. So the little scrap drowned. Well, people will forget that. They've forgotten a lot worse. I mean, look at lovely Hugh. He unzipped his chinos for a prossie blowjob and we forgave him. In fact, I think we loved him a little bit more after that. I mean, she's probably popped up somewhere, hasn't she? Just confused and shivering. Poor little tiny, wet Katie, flapping about in the mud. Washed up on the Isle of Dogs. Yeah. I mean, Eddy... ..things float. Yeah. Yeah, things drift, and they float. I mean, why aren't those idiots floating something down the river? Eddy... ..if you want something done, you've got to do it yourself. Yeah. Right, it's the right place and the right time. What for? Shut up. Right. Are you ready, Pats? Ready, Eddy. Ready for what? THUD Ah! Go, drift. Bubble? Bubble! Where is she, Ed? Darling, I don't know. Bubble? She swims too fast. Bubble! There she is. Go forward! What is she doing? Bubble! Fish her out, the little insect. Bubble! SHE GASPS Bubble? Darling, she fell off. Bubble. Eddy. It's OK, no-one saw. No, but, Eddy, they'll find her! Just go, then! Just go, go, go! Go, darling, go, go, go. Oh, that's great, isn't it? Now I've killed two people! Oh! Come on! Eddy, we've got to get away. We've got to go now. But where? Where? I mean, I can't leave the country, can I? I'm a marked woman! We could go north. North? Well, what, south? I don't know, darling, you know what we need. Yeah, we need money. Yes. Darling, darling. Listen. When this is actually over, and it will actually be over one day, darling... Yeah. ..will you please just remind me... ..to go back for the boots that I just saw in Westwood window. Eddy? Yeah? What is this? Darling, it's a onesie. Oh. Right. Mm. Eddy, I've got some pills. Yeah, pills, pills, pills. I've got some little blue ones, little pink ones. Oh, little pinky. That one, I'll have that little blue one. What's that? It's a button. It's...it's a button! THEY LAUGH I mean, maybe I should just resign myself to my fate, darling. I mean, I can't redecorate my way out of this one, can I? BANG You bitch! No, Eddy, no, we've got to escape. We've got to get out of the country. Darling, I haven't got any money! Why didn't you marry some of those rich men you slept with? That wasn't the point. There must be someone. There must be someone, darling. Someone. Think. We've got to make a serious plan. Think! We could try a bong. I've got a bong. THEY LAUGH Yeah, because everyone used to die young. In old cavemen historical times, they didn't reach the age of 30. And that's why now, everyone's young and they just want to go so fast, but when you're our age, you're completely lost, because... ..we should all be dead. Shouldn't we, darling? No, Eddy, no! It's very good to die young. It is good to go young. Yeah. Yeah. Ah! Oh! Oh, no, it's ash. That's all right. SNIFFS DEEPLY Oh. SNIFFS Ooh... Eddy, there was Charlie. Charlie, darling? Yeah, Charlie Douglas. He had an enormous yacht. Ah, he never married. He said I was the only girl he would ever marry. He said he would wait for me. Oh... We had some good times, Eddy. We had good times. And he was rich! Charlie... He was very rich! Eddy. Yeah? Saffy's little birth blob has money. Darling. We need Lola. We need to take Lola. SHE LAUGHS Oh, we need Lola. I can hear everything you're saying, you know. Everything. Are you looking for my money so you can go find Charlie? No, no, no, darling. No, no, no. Yes! Give us your credit cards and you won't get hurt! Why should I? Oh. Oh... Because, all right, darling, now, you listen to me, all right? I've messed up, I know that, but that's going to happen to anybody who really lives life, who REALLY lives life, darling. And do you know what? I now know who my friends are. Husbands, they come and go, but my friend has stayed. Why does she stay? Because it's bloody good fun. We have fun! It's good fun, darling. Do you see? And you know what? There's so many great times out there waiting for us. And I don't want to miss them. We don't want to miss them, do we, darling? Or would you rather stay here? You know, with Mum. Dull old Mum. Or come with us, sweetheart. Come with us. For fun. Fine. Yes! You're going to need more than the card. We can't just walk out of the house in broad daylight. Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah. We need help. More help. Who else would be stupid enough to help you two? Huh. Oh! So what is Patsy's plan? Just do what I do. We've got to sneak into the house looking perfectly normal. It's going to be a nightmare with all the paparazzi. Right. Excuse me! No, no, no! No photographs! No photographs! But no-one is taking any photos! Extraordinary. It's as if they don't know who we are. Missed a perfect opportunity. Get in. Get in. No photos, no photos. Come on, dear. Police are urging the crowd to move on now.

Oh, he's just some old scrotum that Patsy knows. More money than marbles. Charles was rather superb, actually.
