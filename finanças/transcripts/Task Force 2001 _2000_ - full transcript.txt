(MultiCom Jingle) (dramatic music) (water lapping) (intense music) - Ow! (computer beeps) (loud typing) Game. (sighs) Come on. Come on. (computer beeps) Yes. (energetic drum music) Let's go, let's go. Alright. (breathes heavily) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. (door slams open loudly) (gentle chimes) (grunting) (fast loud typing) (loud thud) (energetic music) (dramatic music) - What a joy. Now I am gonna have some fun. (loud chirping) (loud typing) - Valerie, are you home? I hope, I hope. (water lapping) - [Voiceover] You have a call, Valerie. - Who is it? - [Voiceover] Andrew. (loud beep) - Hello Andrew, aren't you supposed to be in bed or something? (chuckles) - No, I just had to talk to you before I went to sleep. (chuckles) - Well it's nice to know that I'm so important to you. - Yeah, I really like our little chats. I wonder what we'd say if we met for real some time. - Well, I'm sure we will eventually. What are you doing for real? - Oh, just finishing a term paper for Mr. Anderson's Science class. - Your favorite teacher? - Bingo. This report should knock his socks off, soon as he learns how to read, that is. (chuckles) Is that a new office, that looks different? - New job, I know you gonna like it. - Me, why? What is it? - I'm a new game designer at KL Interactive. - Wow, right on! - And I'm sure I can use some of your expert help. - You really think I'm an expert? - Listen, I've got a demo of the game. I'd like to send it to and maybe you can take a look at it for me. - You bet. But I can't tonight, I'm dead if I don't finish this report. - Oh, yes, high school. Well, maybe I'll send it to you later. Bye for now. (loud computer beep) - See you later, alligator. (loud chirping) (water lapping) (sighs) (loud beep) (dramatic music) (loud beeping) (loud chirping) (alarm clock rings) (dog barks) Oh. (loud ringing) Yes! (loud beeping) Valerie, you are the best. (dog barks) (chuckles) Oops. Thanks, Rocky. - Morning, Einstein. - Thanks, Super Mom. Gotta run. Late for butthead's class. - Andrew, really. - Sorry mom, Mr. Butthead. (Rocky barks) - Good catch. (laughs) - Rocky, you know you're not allowed on campus. (Rocky barks) Woof back. You know perfectly well I had to redo the entire cafeteria after your little incident. (Rocky barks) Yes, I know you were framed, but you know the rules. Stay out of trouble, I'll see you after school. (happy music) Good mornin', Pop. - Have you ever seen a more marvelous mailbox? - It is special, alright. It's the most marvelous mailbox in the whole neighborhood. - I wanna get a first coat of paint on, before we leave for Aunt Edna's. You sure you don't wanna come to dinner? - Yeah, Pasadena, Pop. By the way, you missed a spot. Careful, you painted the top. (optimistic rock music) (bell rings) Ah, think I'm late. - Oops. Did I bump into you? - No man, listen, alright, it's my fault. Gotta go to school. - Late for school? Sounds like a personal problem. Maybe too much studying. - Hey, you should try it some time. I thought you were expelled. - Yeah, clever, huh? I figured this is the one place my parole officer wouldn't find me. (Andrew laughs) - Hey listen, I'd love to sit and chat with you and your honor students here, but I got run, alright? (laughter) (birds singing) Now I'm really late. - Take the gum out of your mouth. Please try to stay awake. Mr. Henderson. Hm, too bad. Mr. Williams. - Yes, sir. Ready, sir. - I don't know whether to read this or look at it under a microscope. - (chuckles) Good one, Mr. Anderson. (loud bang on table) - I especially like the mustard stain on the front cover. Nice touch. - (chuckles) That's not just any mustard, that's gourmet mustard. (class laughs) Only the best for you, sir. (chuckles mockingly) (loud rapid footsteps) - Oh, Mr. Anderson. (dramatic music) Morning, sir. (happy music) - Nice manoeuvre, Andrew. (Andrew chuckles) (moves into dramatic music) - Did we forget something, Mr. Henderson? - No, no, it's right here. - What's this? Can't be a term paper. No, I distinctly remember saying no term papers would be accepted late. - That's not fair! - Perhaps you'd like an F on your own paper? Hm? Maybe yes? Maybe no? Maybe yes? Maybe no? I'll take that as a no. We really want that scholarship to MIT, don't we? (sad music) Your parents will be very proud. (laughter) (ominous music) (loud chirping) - Anderson is such a jerk. - Whatever. - Yeah, that will teach him, Cat. - That's Catherine, Gary. - Oh, yeah, right, Catherine. How can you be so cool about this? Aa, even if I tried, which I don't, but if I wanted to and did, I'd still get an F. I mean, you deserve an A on your paper, I guarantee it. - How do you know that? - I mean you're smart, you're real smart, you're, you're like a genius or something. - How do you know how smart I am? - Hey man, I'm an expert. I cheat off you. (laughs nervously) Yet if it weren't for you, I'd have trouble keeping my D average. (bell rings) - You've gotta care about it. - I don't. - What about getting into a good school? - I'm just thinking about going right into the private sector. I already have a consultant job with KL Interactive. - KL Interactive? That's one of the top think tanks in the world. - Yep. - I bet I how he got the job, too. - How? - Through his online girlfriend. - Online girlfriend? Do I know her? - Doubtful. She's an older woman, college girl. Your basic game designer supermodel type. - (sighs) The whole package. - Ah, she sent me a prototype of a new game called Mind Chaser. - Mind Chaser? - The cool. - [Gary] Excellent. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And when do we play? How about tonight after school? - Yeah, why not? How about you, Cat, you wanna come over and give this new game a try? - It's Catherine and I wouldn't miss it. - Basketball? - Yeah. (sad romantic music) - So this is the famous mailbox? (light playful music) - Yeah, it's hard to believe my dad ever had a life. (Catherine laughs) - Nice mailbox. - Thank you, nice bike. - Hey thanks, I fixed it up myself. (Gary sighs) Being an adult is so embarrassing. - [Mr. Anderson] Hey, about a hand? (loud clapping) (Andrew cheers) - I'm sorry, Dad. I got so excited I'm not going to Aunt Edna's, I forgot myself. - If it were up to me, I'd be staying home myself. - Yeah, looks like the mailbox needs another coat of paint. - Really? - Honey, stop looking at the mailbox, you're gonna go blind. Hi Cat. - I prefer Catherine, Mrs. Henderson. - I like your new haircut, looks nice, I used to wear my hair that way. Who's this? - Gary Williams, at your service, Mrs. Henderson. No job to low for me to go. - Well, how charming. Well, there's food in the freezer if you can figure out how to work the microwave. I'm just kidding. And what else? - No parties! - Thank you. - Not even the Republican Party? (engine revving) - Bye. (water lapping) (dramatic music) (loud keyboard typing) (moves into ominous scary music) (Valerie loses breath in terror) - (sighs) You startled me. - Sorry. I love what you're doing with the game. It's so lifelike. So real. - You ever play your games? - Not anymore. I used to, but then I got hooked. On bigger game. (laughs) Keep up the good work. (loud chirping) - Gotta dig your crib, bro. - Yeah, thanks. - Hey, what's this? Your retainer? - Yeah, be careful with that, alright? It's a Waldo, I built that. - Say what? - It's a digital facial telemetry interface. - Oh, yeah, awesome. Aa, what does that mean? - Watch this. (loud computer beep) (high pitch undulating music) Hello, my name is Rocky. (Rocky barks) How are you? (Rocky barks) - Wow. Rocky, I'm doing great. - Righteous. Hello, Cat. You're looking mighty pretty today. Want a big wet kiss? - Any time, Rocky, any time. - Hey, speaking of games, how about Mind Chaser? - Yeah, Mind Chaser. - Mind Chaser it is. (loud beep) (loud thunder) - It says you need a KL Interactive VR Game Interface. - Got three right here, they're practically givin' 'em away at all the video stores. (loud chirping) (Rocky barks) - Girlfriend, you are good. - I am good, and I'm not your girlfriend. (loud beeps) - Ouch. - But if Andrew's looking I might consider, or maybe not. (loud explosion) (Andrew screams) (Rocky barks) Darn. - Ha ha. You have your four seconds. - Yeah, but the game keeps crashing at the same point, right when it gets good. - Can you fix it? - I don't know, my computer's just not strong enough to handle it. - It's a sloppy craftsman who blames his tools. - I can't figure it out. - Well maybe your friend, Valerie, can help us out. - I'll call her. (loud ringing) - (sighs) Problem is gotta be with one of these original master disks. - [Voiceover] Sorry, no one available. Do you wish to leave a virtual message? - Yes I do. One second, please. (palms snap loudly) Valerie, hi, hi you doin'? Andrew here. Uhm, listen, Mind Chaser's a great game, I'm lovin' it, but I can't seem to get past the problems with it. Aa, I don't think my system's strong enough to handle it, and what I think I need is access to a really, really hot mainframe. I was wonderin' if you could do it. Uhm, so I hope to see you soon. Bye. (loud beeps) - Oh, well, I've got to split anyway. - [Voiceover] Good evening, Valerie, you have a virtual message. - From whom? - [Voiceover] From Andrew. - Fire it up. (loud beeps) - Valerie, Andrew here. Uhm, listen, Mind Chaser's a really great game, and I'm lovin' it, but I can't seem to get past the problems with it. What I really need is access to a really hot mainframe, and I was wondering if you could do it. Uhm, I hope to see you soon. Bye. (loud typing) - Well, if Simon wants his game to be finished quickly, I'm gonna have to give Andrew a little help. Send computer tie in for US Government research computer, all access pass. - [Voiceover] Access code required. (loud typing) Access granted. (loud typing) - Hello, Andrew. I'm sending you a direct backdoor Ethernet access to a very powerful mainframe. I hope it helps. Good luck, handsome. (loud beeping) (ominous music) That's pretty weird. US Military developing game technology? - [Voiceover] You have entered a secure disk. You will need top security access codes to enter. (loud typing) Code accepted, welcome to Project Quest. - Let's see what secrets you hold. - It looks like we got mice again. - It's a weapon. We're developing a weapon. (dramatic music) Andrew. (loud typing) - [Voiceover] Terminal still occupied. Do you wish to send a delayed visual message? - Yes. Andrew, stop playing with the game, destroy all copies, it's very, very dangerous. My life my be in danger. - Working late, Val? I think you may have dropped this. Oh, my. What have we found? - This is a military weapon, not a game. - War is a game, in a way. I told you I still play games, just on a bigger playing field. - You disgust me. - I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping we could become good friends and colleagues, but that doesn't alter the fact that this game must finish on time. - Well you can finish it without me. - I think you misunderstand me. You're not gonna like our retirement plan. (loud chirping) (loud beep) - Hm? (computer beeps) Yeah right, Valerie did it. - Did what? - She tied us into a government computer. All right, wait till I tell Cat. (loud chirping) - So we waitin' on an invitation or what? Are you gonna get this game up and running? - Patience, the product of public education. My genius, and Cat's planning, we should have it up in no time. (loud typing) - This computer is amazing, it's so fast. What exactly did this Valerie do? - She tied me into a government computer. - (sighs) No wonder you like her, connections. - Yeah, you should see what she looks like. - Why not? - Hello, Andrew, I'm sending you a direct backdoor Ethernet access to a very powerful mainframe. Hope it helps. Good luck, handsome. - Ha, wow, what a fox. - (sighs) I think I'm gonna barf. Just kidding. (Rocky whimpers) (loud computer beeps) What's this? - It's an encrypted message. - Encrypted, you mean like Tales from the Crypt, like zombies and stuff? - You're the zombie. This is code, like spy stuff. - No kiddin'. - I don't really know this kind of encryption. - Let's try the mainframe thing, see if that can open the file. (fun music) (loud buzz) I mean, if you guys think that's a good idea. - Might not be as big a screw-up as you act. - That'd be just about impossible, wouldn't it? - Do it to it, dude. - Please decipher and return. Thank you. (loud beeping) (dramatic music) - We have a Code One violation, some entity is trying to hack our computer. We have a problem. (telephone rings) - Yes, Jackson. A Code One on our mainframe? That's impossible. Yes, I agree, I consider that compromise. Okay, I'll look into it. Totally a compromise. Impressive. - I wonder how powerful this government computer really is. - Let's take this thing for a ride. - Alright, look who came to play. - Let me show you what a woman can do. Andrew, crank the music. Gentlemen, to the window. (loud rock music) (roaring thunder) - Who are these guys? They've devectored one of our primary satellites. - Awesome. - No one would believe we ever did this. - Would be an urban legend. - Urban legend? - Yeah, like in Florida, the guy was in the toilet, and the snakes climbs up the sewer pipe and bites him on the butt. - That's not a true story? - D'oh! For a smart guy you got some short circuits. - Well I believe if one kind of stuff can go out in one direction, then another kind of stuff, like a snake, find its way in the other way. (loud beeping) - Yo Cat, impressive. - Thanks. (Rocky barks) - It's a message from Valerie but, that's funny, she never encrypts anything. - Woman of endless surprises. Just my type. Hey, let's play it. - Andrew, stop playing with the game, destroy all copies, it's very, very dangerous. My life may be in danger. - Kind of short on the sense of humor, though. (dramatic music) - This is no joke. - You're right, she looks scared to me. (loud beeps) - [Voiceover] No such terminal number, please check your number and call again. (loud typing) No such terminal number, please check your number and call again. - Something's happened to her. - Something bad. - It's up to us now. We're the only us who can save Valerie. Let's ride. (energetic happy music) I think we're being followed. - Oh, right. - Oh oh, black car, we're doomed. - Alright, maybe I do have an overactive imagination. Turn here. (car skids loudly) Well now what do you think? - [Catherine And Gary] Coincidence. - [Andrew] Let's lose him. - [Catherine] Off we go. (car skids loudly) - Woo-hoo, that was close. - We're bad. - [Gary] Alright. (Catherine laughs) - Excellent riding. Who were those guys? (dramatic guitar music) - Nice riding, kids. Hacking into a government computer, redirecting a government satellite, you kids are looking at a whole mess of trouble. We're talking jail, humiliation, scandal. Throw away any thoughts you had about scholarships. Forget your parents' hopes for your futures. What on earth were you thinkin'? - We think Andrew's friend has been kidnapped by KL Interactive. - Yeah, kidnapped. - Aha. - We think they're developing a dangerous computer game. - A death game. - Aha. - Um, look, sir. They're not to blame, alright? It's my fault. I have a friend, an acquaintance actually, her name's Valerie. - Did you say Valerie? - Oh, I knew she was trouble the minute I saw her. - Yeah, Valerie. (sighs) - I have to level with you, I have a problem. - We'll never do it again. - No, you're not my problem, but you might be my solution. You say KL Interactive has been developing a dangerous game? Well I believe that to be a fact. You think Valerie was kidnapped? So do I. See, Valerie was working for me, she was, is one of my best agents, and I've lost contact with her. I need a team to rescue her. I need you. - Why us? - Because KL Interactive is closed down as tight as a drum, I can't get an agent inside. They're so tied into the military industrial complex that they know who all my agents are. - So you want us? - Yes, because no one would believe I would use kids. I really have no choice. - We don't know anything about spying. We're just teenagers. - Yeah, it's teenagers. - In the next few days, you'll become bigger, better and brawnier than you've ever imagined, with training. - (sighs incredulously) What about school? What about our parents? What about homework? - Now you leave that to me. I'll prepare a letter saying you'd been accepted into a special one-month training program for exceptional teenagers. (light chiming) - No school, no parents, no homework? (light music) Gotta love it. (military drumming music) - Come on, maggot, you can do it, come on! Two, one, two! - I did those numbers already, can we move on to three? - Drop and give me 20, dogmeat! (Gary sighs) (sad music) (light music) This is a Special Forces climbing harness, used in insertion and extraction of troops. - No problemo. - Piece of cake. - Born climbing. - Well let's do it. - Well what do you think? (wacky music) - I think if you've mastered the art of rappelling you'll not have this kind of problem again. - What are you talking about problem, what's wrong with this? - Well look at you, you're hanging upside down, for crying out loud. - 'Cause I'm supposed to be! - This is not how it's supposed to be, if this was a real situation, you'd be a dead man by now. You got that? - [Andrew] I'm ready, alright? I'm ready to go. Let's go. - Five, six, seven, eight. - Now we're getting somewhere. (laughter) (loud beeping) - The computer development isn't moving as fast as we need. - She needs prodding. Perhaps we should do to Valerie what we're going to do to the world at large. - Her entire mind could be scrambled. - Ow, silly me. Perhaps another time. (gong rings loudly) (traditional Asian music) - Now remember be your opponent, and you can defeat your opponent. (Andrew screams a battle cry) (hits thud on flesh) (gong rings loudly) (Rocky barks) I said be your opponent, not be the mat. - That's more like it, this is going better than our wildest dreams. I mean your wildest dreams. (intense drumming) (gong rings loudly) (traditional Asian music) - Purple belt? - I like the color. (hits thud against flesh) (gong rings loudly) Don't you think purple's a prettier color than white now? (Rocky barks) - Ready, I'm tellin' you. - Well I say you're not. You're too young, too green and too soft, and if you slip up, it's over, for you and for Valerie. - We can do it. - Yeah, we're ready. - Give us a field test, toughest one you got. (ominous music) - The Drop. (mysterious music) (Rocky barks) - It's the dog! (intense music) - I got him in my sights, (speaker is drowned out by music). - Yes! - [Voiceover] I got him! Hey! - Hey! Come back here with my bag. Get him. He dropped the bag. He dropped the bag, (speaker is drowned out by music). Hey! - [Blonde Man] Hey! (ominous music) - Well, well, well, looks like the little loser is back for some extracurricular activity. - Look, I don't want any trouble from you guys, alright? I'm working as a secret government agent. - (laughs) Yeah, and my grandma's in the FBI. What you got in the bag? - Nothing, please don't take my bag. - You mean my bag? (sighs) - Amateurs. (Andrew mumbles) - [Blonde Man] Alright, game's over. - You're under arrest, you have the right to remain silent. - I knew they weren't ready. (Rocky barks) - Well what do you think? - I think you need another six months of training, I think if this works, it's gonna be a miracle. - You mean we got no choice? - Exactly. We begin now. - Cool TV. - It's a holographic screen, I've read about these, but I never knew they really existed. - You're gonna see a lot of stuff you thought didn't exist. Just remember, you make one mistake and we may never see any of you again. Thanks to this man. (loud beep) This is Simon Westbourne, owner of KL Interactive. He's one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world. As you know, he's developing a weapon disguised as a game, but that's all we know about him. Your mission is to sneak into KL Interactive and establish yourselves as games experts. Once you're in, you connect with Valerie, she's your primary mission. - Wait a minute! Valerie's email message, maybe there's a clue. (intense music) (loud typing) - Andrew, stop playing with the game, destroy all copies, it's very, very dangerous. My life may be in danger. - She's really scared. - Shh! Look, she's scared and yet what does she do? - She grabs something. A disk! - And she hides it behind that picture. - [Andrew] It must've been important to her. - Well it just became important to us. We have to get you in there now. (loud beeping) - Excellent. The simulators prove the game will work. I knew you'd have the wisdom to come around. - I'm a professional, I do my job, that doesn't mean I like it. - Please, such harsh words from such soft lips. Can't we just get along? - Are we quite finished? - Not quite. (scary music) Not until I release it on the Internet. - The Internet? This is a weapon. - A game first, that becomes a weapon, a mind control device directed at anyone who plays. Delightful, isn't it? And soon we'll share our pleasure with the entire galaxy of Internet cyberspace. - May I help you? - Yeah, we're the new game testers. - Pros from Oak Valley. (loud beeps) - Well, I guess you are game testers. I swear they get younger looking every day. These are access passes only to the main floor. Don't go wandering around. - Thanks. - Yeah, thank you. - [Catherine] Thank you. So, what's in the bag? - Backup. - We're the new game testers. - I don't remember any new game testers. - Andrew, I can't believe they only offered you a salary of 750,000. - Yeah. - I get 850,000. With incentives. (Rocky barks) - [Catherine] He gets 100,000. - $850,000, huh? - Yeah, people over 30 will believe anything. - We are in. - Coming in loud and clear. - This place is huge. (dramatic music) (loud beeps) - Valerie's office. Alright, you guys keep a lookout. (sad music) Well, Valerie, I almost met you in person. - How's it going in there? (intense music) - It's going. - Andrew, will you hurry up? - We gotta split. - What's taking them so long? - I can't believe Valerie's in trouble over a disk. No, there's gotta be more. - Can I help you? - (clears throat) Yes, I'm looking for my office. - Who are you again? - A game tester. - Yeah, right. (loud squeaking) (energetic music) This is a highly-secured facility, you, you can't just wander around. I got a kid here says he's a game tester. - Yeah, he's authorized to be here. No listing of an office, he just started today. - Okay, copy that. Get going. And stay out of secured areas until I find out where your office is. - I think it's a corner office. Eh, south facing, I don't think they gave me a corner office. I can tell. Good boy, Rocky. Good boy, that's a good boy, what you find? (dramatic music) Valerie? It's you. - Andrew? (sighs) What are you doing here? I told you it was dangerous. - I've come to rescue you. - How'd you get in? - We pretended to be game testers. - (sighs) You shouldn't have come. - I had to, alright? I was worried I'd never meet you for real. - That's very sweet. (moves into ominous music) You're on the wrong floor. Simon, I'd like you to meet one of our newest game testers. - How charming, that would explain the other one. - This is a highly-secured facility, we can't have kids wandering around. She says they're game testers. - Yeah, we're your new game testers. - I see. - Yes, I brought them in to help speed up research on the new game. - Good idea. - And boy are we good. - Well, I hope you enjoy our games. Show them out, could you? Security, I don't know what these kids know, get rid of them. (chuckles maliciously) No, second thoughts, they could be our new game testers after all. - Lost or something, man? - Gee, I might be, but not as lost as you. At least I know where waste disposal is. (energetic music) (speaker is drowned out by music) Come and get you. - [Andrew] Go, go, go, go. - [Catherine] I'm going, I'm going. - [Security Guard] Freeze! Hold it! - Okay. Got 'em! - Get him! (loud thud) (scientist screams in panic) - No, no, no, no! (loud crash) - [Security Officer] Hold it! I almost got 'em. - I need your badges. - Yeah, I'll get 'em. (loud chirping) - (heavy breathing) We made it. - [Security Officer] You two are crazy. - I see I'm gonna have to keep you on a much tighter leash. - It's just as I thought, Simon is dipping in some dangerous and banned projects. - What's Project Quest? - It was new technology that used computers to broadcast directly into the human brain and manipulate it. The program was shut down, or at least it was supposed to be. - Can he pull it off? - Well, if anyone can, he can. - If anyone can stop him. - [Catherine And Gary] We can! (loud beeping) - I was able to tie into the city's planning archives. - Yes! This isn't gonna be easy to figure out. - Watch this. (loud beep) - Oh, it's like you can touch it. - Only with your brain. (dramatic music) - Welcome to your splendid new quarters. I apologize if it's not everything you dreamed of. This could all change if you fix the game. - How can you ask me to work on this? It's not right. - Right? Wrong? These terms are relative, the world is changing every day, why not be a part of the team that's controlling those changes? And become wealthy while you're at it. You know, if you don't cooperate, I'll find someone who will, and then you'll be history. - Valerie is most likely located in a cell on level three. It's protected by a specialized card key access. - What about the mainframe? - It's isolated right here. KL Interactive's mainframe computer is one of the fastest in the world, it's cooled with liquid nitrogen. It says here that it's a standalone system, and it's not connected to any other computer. There's no way to hack it, you'd have to get inside the room to access it. - Yeah, but with a nitrogen-cooled system, they'd have to have extensive venting and ducting to keep the temperature constant. - Just ask. (loud beep) - Yeah, a vent leads right into the computer room. Piece of cake. - Not so easy. - Why, why not? - Well, the room is protected by a weight-sensitive security system, anything over 50 pounds will trigger it. Not close. (Rocky barks) - No problem. - The door to the room is guarded 24 hours a day. - Yeah, and it requires an electronic key to deactivate the weight trigger security system. (chuckles) I cheated. I read their training manual. (classy music) (Catherine laughs) Only two exist, Simon has one and the computer designer has the other. They keys are kept around the neck and they never take 'em off. - Never? - Never. - How about stealing one of 'em? - As soon as one of the keys was reported missing, they would just create new keys. - New keys, new code, and we're back to square one. - Well how about copying the keys? - The keys are unique, the code is hardwired into the circuitry. We would need to have one in order to make a duplicate. And I'd need the right equipment. - You will have the right equipment. (dramatic music) - Can I help you? - Do you know what this is? It's a pen. A pen. (sighs in relief) Sign here. Complements of your friend, John. Here is our card, we have an Internet website, if you need anything else, just order it. (loud banging on steel suitcase) We usually ship in under 24 hours. (taller man clears throat) Well under 24 hours. - Thanks. - It's a key duplicating device, electronic imaging to clone the circuitry. - Excellent. I wonder how long it would take to make a copy. - Two minutes. (chuckles) I cheated, I read the manual. (Catherine chuckles) - Now all we have to do is figure out how to get a key. (mysterious music) - [Catherine] Every day at exactly 12:30, Bill goes to Charly Temmel's for an ice cream cone. (camera shutter clicks) Then when he finishes with his cone, he plays pinball for exactly half an hour. (pinball machine beeps) - He always plays this one pinball machine? - Give me the key, and I can clone it. - You have a plan? - I think they do. - Excuse me, I alwas play Weenie Brain from 12:30 to one. - Sorry to hear that. (pinball machine beeps) - See all those high scores? All mine. Next game. (pinball machine game over music) - What's that around your neck, good luck charm? (pinball machine beeps) (intense fun music) - I'm stuck, somebody help me. Somebody help me. (game designer screams) (pinball machine beeps) - One, two, three. Wow, I've never seen anyone use that technique before. - Oh, oh, that's the highest score I've ever gotten, oh. - That's great, I will name a ice cream after you, you will be world famous. (game designer sighs) - What do you mean you can't find the key? - I know it's one of these. - I thought those were the ones you already tried. (key chain clinks) - Oh, (speaks quietly). Next time you guys crawl into the tight spot and I watch. Anyway, here's the key. I know more about pinball than I ever thought I would. - Alright, look, now we got the key. Now we need to figure out how to get into the system. And we're gonna need some pretty sophisticated technology. Anything we want. - In under 24 hours. - Way under 24 hours. (continuous loud beeping) - This is an exciting moment, the edge of a new millennium. With me as the most powerful man in the world. And you by my side. - Excuse me while I throw up. - Communication devices. - Ah, virtual reality computer headset. - Six million in US negotiable treasure certificates. Gotcha. (chuckles) - Security badges. (loud beeps) - Aa, face-morphing device. - [All] Gotta have one. - How about a Special Forces cyber dog combat suit with camera mount? (Rocky barks) (Catherine laughs) - [All] Gotta have one. - Night vision goggles. - Face-morpher. - Excellent. - I'm sorry, Rocky, no cyber dog outfit. Ah, just kidding, it's right here, Rocky! (Rocky barks) - What do you suppose this is? - It's a laser pen. (loud explosion) Awesome. - Oh, I hope nobody wanted more tea. - Huh, excellent. - Those look good on you. - Hey, check this out. Hey, say something. - Andrew is a hunk. (Andrew laughs) - [Voiceover] Andrew is a hunk. - Not! - Wow, voice wave automatic synthesizer. Nice. - It's only a question of hours now. Finally a world in which children are under control. (dramatic music) No more whining, no more complaining. Kids, how do we stomach them? (sighs) Simon says will actually mean something. Simon says, "Do the dishes." Simon says, "Clean your room." (laughs maniacally) Simon says, "Eat your liver." (laughs maniacally) - [John] So what do you think? - About what? - Our training ground. This is the duct termination, here is the key code insert monitor. - I think it looks like a bunch of trash cans and boxes. - Here, try these on. Might give you a better idea of what you're in for. - [Andrew] How do you know it's accurate? - [Catherine] We used the computer coordinates (dramatic music) from the building plants. - Excellent. Wow, this is amazing technology, I can see everything. Mainframe's right here, the front door's right here. (palms snap loudly) Come here, Rocky, come here boy. Come on, come on, come here boy. There you go. Welcome to the mainframe, Rocky. Come here, Rocky, come here, here's the card key, pick it up, pick it up, good, good, hold it, hold it. Good boy, good boy, Rocky. Good boy, there you go. (applause) - Good. (laughs) - You can access the face and voice files, right? Like that nerdy Bill guy? (laughter) How to state. Hey, load it into the morpher. (loud beep) - Done. - Alright, let's see if this thing really works. - There's no time, it'll have to work. (ominous music) (water lapping) - Bill? Didn't you just leave? - I forgot something in my office. - Oh, sounds like you're catching a cold. (Bill clears throat) (mysterious music) - Man, this thing itches. I'm in. - And we read you, five by five. - We're good to go. Wish us luck. - Good luck, team. (drill buzzes loudly) - I'm off. I've got Simon in my sights. - Be careful with him. - Oops, oops. - You klutz. (whimsical music) - Oops, sorry sir. (intense music) Ready to tie in. - Ready. First stage. That's it, we are in, disconnecting perimeter. - It's showtime. How do we look? (loud beeps) - Looking good and vice versa. Take the second right. (loud beeps) - What do you want? Can't you see I'm working as fast as I can? (whimsical music) - Oh my god. - Ta da. It's me. Your hero. I'm here to rescue you. - How'd you do that? - It's a science, don't ask. Let's boogie. - I can't leave. - Well, maybe if I would've morphed into Andrew, then you'll leave? - Listen, if I leave, Simon will know that you're on to him. He plans to release the game tomorrow night on the Internet. You have to stop him. (intense music) - You're looking good, as always. (Andrew breaths heavily) - This place is a maze. Ha, it's the vent to the mainframe. Good boy, Rocky. We're at the mainframe. - Copy that. (drill buzzes loudly) - Ready, Rocky? (Rocky barks) I'm counting on you. (loud beeps) (intense music) (loud beep) Geronimo. (Rocky barks) Good boy, Rocky. Go over there. Yeah, good boy, Rocky. (loud beeps) - Alarm off. - I'm on the floor. (Rocky barks) (loud beeping) Okay, I'm hooked into the mainframe. (loud beeping) (loud beeping) - Simon's on the move heading toward the safe. - [Voiceover] Access denied. - Something's wrong. - What is it? - [Voiceover] Access code two, two, two, three, three, eight required. - Access code two, two, two, three, three, eight is a request for Simon's personal code, it's locked in the mainframe. Only he knows it. - (sighs) Come on, Andrew. You can do it. - [John] Gary, Simon's on the, turning into Straten. - I'm on it. - What can we do? - Wait! The launch program for the game is stored in a different part of the system. You should be able to download enough of it to prevent the release of the game. At least temporarily. - The launch program's huge, I can only take a part of it. - [Both] Do it! (dramatic music) - Simon is coming, you have to get out. - I'm working as fast as I can. - Simon's at the door. Have to stop him. Oh. - You blithering idiot. - Sorry, sir. (Gary screams) (whimsical music) - Are you alright? - Come on. Not now. You know timing is everything. (machine buzzes continuously) - All cleaned up? (whimsical music) - Simon has Gary. - I better see what I can do. - Okay, I've got it. (dramatic music) The door, Rocky. (loud beeps) - Welcome to the heart of KL Interactive. The home of Mind Chaser. (loud beeps) It appears that someone has left the computer port open. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? - Me? No. So, Simon, you don't mind if I call you Simon? - I do. - I think you got me all wrong. See you, you and I are very similar. - Similar? - Yeah, like two peas in a pod. - And your point is? - We should go in business together. All I need is the West Coast. Did I say West Coast? What I really meant is Southern California. - What? - Make me an offer. - How about nothing? - Nothing? Could be good. - And in exchange for nothing you'll tell me everything and who you're working for. Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time. Like the rest of your short life. - No. - That's my cue to run. (ominous music) - Guards! - Rocky, you are insane! (laughs) (energetic music) Let's rock. Yeehaw! (Andrew screams) - You're almost out. (door slides open loudly) (moves dramatic music) - Thanks for trying to help. - Don't mention it. - Listen, I know you think that-- - No, you listen. I'm just gonna spit it out and that's it. I really like Andrew, okay? And he doesn't pay attention to me because he has a total crush on you. So let's not pretend to be friends. You're way too smart and beautiful. Let's not pretend anything, and let's just figure out a way to get out of this place. - Andrew and I are just friends. - But he thinks-- - I know. But if he knows that he has someone like you who really likes him. (hopeful music) You're very pretty, you know? You just need a little self-confidence. If he's the right guy, just give him a smile and a wink, and he'll know. - (chuckles) This is so stupid. - Hey, it's all about attitude. If you don't believe in yourself, no one else will. - What I believe is that we're never gonna get out of this place. - Hey, it's about confidence. (Catherine chuckles) - Thanks. (Valerie chuckles) - It's my fault, I slipped up. - No, you couldn't have done anything. Now we just have to get him back. - But how? - We have a bargaining chip. Just need a plan. - Okay, we've gotta get out of here. Simon plans to release game tonight, it has amazing mind control properties. It's a mental virus. - We'll stop them, Andrew has part of the launch code. - No, that'll just slow him down. We need to destroy the mainframe before he goes online tonight. - Then there's no way into the system. - [Valerie] None. (hopeful music) - Wait, I've got it! It's like the urban legend. - What do you mean? - I know how to stop Simon. (moves into dramatic music) - Well, you wanted to be game testers, I guess you can be the first test pilots. - You're insane. - The world is changing every day, we must change with it. I've enjoyed our relationship, Valerie. (telephone rings) - Call for you. - Right on time. - Andrew. - Yeah, Simon. I have a deal to offer you. - I'm listening. - Your disk for the girls. - Disk for the girls? - Don't do it, Andrew! Remember the snake that bit the guy in the butt. - Cute. You bring me the disk, I'll give you the girls. - I'm not coming to you. - Very well, where are we going to do the exchange? - Front of my house, tonight. - Alone, no police, and no friends. - Alone. - I can't think of a better place to launch Mind Chaser. I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait. I don't want to show up with damaged goods. (scary screeching music) - Why would Cat mention the guy that got bit on the butt by a snake? - Bit on the butt? By a snake? - You know the urban legend? - Wait a minute, I know what she was talking about. I have a plan. (loud chirping) (intense music) - Go on, out. (Rocky barks) - Stay. (Rocky barks) Stay. - Where's the disk? - It's right here, Simon. - Toss it here. - Don't do it! - Where's that idiot Bill? - Who, Mr. Westbourne? - The computer nerd, Bill! (car brakes loudly) (Rocky barks) - My dad's mailbox. Now you guys are really in trouble. - Sorry I'm late, car trouble. - So I see. - This is the right disk. - Clever boy. Check it for viruses. (loud beeping) - The disk is cleared, no viruses, no trojan horses. - Send it to the mainframe. Let's get this show started. - Oh, I'll need your access code to enter the mainframe. - It's showtime. - [Voiceover] Access granted. - What are you doing? - Simon, I couldn't figure out what Cat meant when she mentioned the snake, but then it came to me. See, Simon, when your computer's connected to the Internet, it's like a toilet connected to the sewer. And when your garbage goes out, we can get in. (mischievous music) And just like the snake that bit the man's butt, I can bite yours. - You can't access my mainframe without my codes. - That's true, but we have your code now. You just gave it to us. (whimsical music) (Rocky barks) - This can't be! (loud beeps) You're in my system. - You wanna play a game, Simon? Play ours! (energetic music) Land holdings in Asia. (loud beeps) Gone. Looks like you have offshore accounts for one billion dollars. (loud beeps) Gone. - You can't ruin me. (loud beeps) - US Treasury certificates. What do you think Gary, you need six million in negotiable US Treasury certificates? - Donate it to save the whales. - Hey, you know what? Let's just erase the whole empire. (loud beeps) (loud continuous explosions) Bankrupt Simon, it's over. You've lost. (police sirens wailing) You have nothing. - Simon, you're under arrest. (dramatic music) (gun is cocked loudly) (Rocky barks) - You may have ruined me, but I'm not giving up that easily. - Don't do it. - You stay where you are. (Rocky barks) - It's time to give up, Simon. - Wrong, Andrew. (loud gunshot) (Rocky wails in pain) - Rocky? Rocky? (sad music) You need to get up. Get up, Rocky. Rocky, get up boy. (cries) Don't die, Rocky. Help. - Rocky. (Rocky barks) - Rocky! (energetic music) Rocky. (laughs) - The cyber suit, it's bullet proof. - Rocky! Oh god. - Attaboy, Rocky. - Rocky! Oh, good boy, good boy! - Beaten by kids. - Not just any kids. - (sighs in relief) Rocky saved my life. (Rocky barks) And you. You're pretty amazing yourself. Were you always this amazing, Cat? (optimistic music) Catherine. (Catherine laughs) (Simon groans) - This is a top secret government project. Your son's a hero, but you can't tell anyone about it. - My mailbox! - Everything will be back in order by dawn. Better than ever. (Mrs. Henderson gasps) (happy music) - And this is the last remaining copy of the game. (loud beeps) (roaring thunder) Anybody wanna play Mind Chaser? - [Catherine And Gary] Not. (loud beeps) - [Voiceover] Disk erased. You have a virtual caller. - Oh. - [Catherine] Uh oh. - [Andrew] Send it through. - Andrew, Catherine, Gary and Rocky. (Rocky barks) I have a mission for you, if you choose to accept it. (dramatic music) (Rocky barks) (moves into energetic music) (MultiCom Jingle)
