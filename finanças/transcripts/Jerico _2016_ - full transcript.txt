Mr. Spurling, so glad you could make it. I wouldn't miss this for the world. Oh wonderful. The kids are just so excited to show all the work they did with the gallery for the center fundraiser especially your grandson Percy. He brought in an old shoebox full of goodies for the wall. Oh did he? A shoebox you say? Yeah. He said he found it in your basement. And, I must admit the photos inside are truly amazing. My goodness it was like going back in a time machine. Oh. What's wrong, grandpa? You're not gonna believe the story behind this picture. I can hardly believe it myself. I can't hold it a minute longer. This is a story of perseverance, of hope. This is a story of two boys trying to keep their black asses alive. This is the story of Jericho. Buy your next automobile here. Hi, my name's Dale Stevens. There ain't nothing better in this world than a truck with diesel. Jarvis, supper's ready. Mama, watch this. Jericho, do it again. Hi my name is Dale Stevens, and boy do I have a deal for you. Come on down to Be the Motorist and get one of our fine automobiles. Jericho, that was real good. How'd you learn to do that? I don't know. Mama, can Jericho stay for dinner? I suppose so. Yes. Ma, look who's staying for dinner. Well I sure would hate for company to get a beating, but that's exactly what's gonna happen if y'all don't get in there in that there table. Y'all go on and get washed up now. Boys, mama. Sweetie. Oh hey baby. Hey baby, what's for dinner? Cornbread, collard greens, and black eyed peas. All right, fix me a plate, please. Where's Junior? Oh he be home in a minute. He's over at Bobby's house. They've been studying for that arithmetic exam all week. Oh Thomas, wouldn't it be something to have another Negro doctor in this world? Baby, the look on your face, what's troubling you? No matter what I do it ain't never good enough. Boss man, said I want you to come in early, pull a second shift. I say yes sir, no problem sir. Anything you need me to do, sir. You know they had that job on that board for over two weeks. I would walk by it everyday on my five minute break while all the white fellas is sitting around slacking. Sometimes I just stop, and I just look at it knowing I can do the job if they'd just give me a chance. They know I can run that paper machine better than anybody. But, Negroes ain't eligible for promotion. So some white man is paper press manager, been there three months. You oughta be glad you got a job. What? Mama, how can you say something like that? Yeah mama, that ain't right. Thomas has had a tough day today. No, that's okay, baby. It's okay. I wouldn't expect her to understand no way. Don't expect me to understand. I grew up in the era when there wasn't no such thing as a job that pays a Negro and here you are complaining about a promotion. They'd take you out and beat you or worse. Son, you's a free man. You get to come home everyday from your job to a home and a family that belong to you. So what is some white man is doing a job you think you can do better? Understand one thing, the white man gonna always have a bigger piece of the pie. Now he might leave you the crumbs from the crust. You just take it and move on. See in my day we had to pick our battles. Pick your battles wisely. So mama, you're saying I'm just supposed to sit here, do nothing, and be some hushed up Negro? That's exactly what I'm saying you ought to do. So hush up, Negro. I done filed a complaint already anyway. Yeah, maybe I need to find me some Paul Robeson type fella to come in and take a look at it, huh? No baby listen, just ask God for favor and direction. He'll see you through. He always does. What in God's name taking that boy so long to get home? Now he know better than to be this late for dinner. Oh calm down, baby, calm down. He'll be here in a minute. You know how hard that math is to master, and you know Lars Jones is always on him. Got to get that schooling in there. You got to have God's passion in your soul, and you gotta have hands that create. Or, as he would have said, head, heart, and hands. All I know I'm gonna take these hands right here, and go out there and get me a switch from that tree if he don't get his butt here in two minutes. Damn boy is holding things up. Now I want him to be a math whiz, but not if I means we gonna starve to death. Son, for 60 years I fought the fight. Now it's up to you to protect the family. Listen y'all stay here and stay low. Thomas, Thomas. Junior. Thomas, Thomas! Oh my God! ♪ I need you, Lord, to stand by me ♪ ♪ Ooh Sure is some pretty girls in this joint tonight. I'm about to nearly lose my damn mind. Boy, I think you done lost your mind already, Jericho. These are the same women that was in here last week. It don't make no difference. Ain't that right, Jarvis? Skip, I don't know what you talking about. I'm just a happily married man trying to get a promotion. Man, a promotion? I'm tell y'all.

And, now you think LBJ gonna stick his neck out for our black asses? Nothing to say? Yeah, that's what I thought. And, even if it do pass, shit I'm gonna let one of these other Negroes apply, let them have to deal with watching their back. Shit, if it ever do pass, I'm gonna be the first Negro in line. I mean that. Back to my bet. I say we starting off at $2. Who in, anybody? Who in? Skip, let me borrow $2, man? Now you wait just a damn minute. Didn't I just let you borrow $2 on Sunday to make it through the week? You just gonna blow me out like that in front of everybody? I told you last week was a long week, man.

She got a little something for me if you know what I mean? What you mean? Now you know what I mean. Mr. Parsons, what's your take on this whole civil rights thing? I really do think it's a good thing in a way. Let me tell y'all something. Now Jarvis, you know I worked with your daddy at that mill pretty near 30 year. And, I seen these white people walk all over him. He was the best man down there at the mill. Walked over me too, hell I even had to run moonshine one night. Hell I remember I made $50 in six hours. $50? I woke up next morning laying my uniform out ironed it real good, bought me some new gloves and a brand new pair of boots. I walked in that morning, and I told the boss man, "Sir, I'm here for duty, and I'm quitting "at the same Goddamn time." That's what told him. Sure did. Then what? Shit I started running moonshine six nights a week. Shit, that's a lot of money for a Negro back in those days. You can't make that kind of money. Saved up enough money to buy this place right here, and I ain't looked back a day since. Up until right now. Oh shit, I gotta go introduce my next act. Hey Jarvis, don't you be no stranger around here, okay? Okay. Damn it if you don't look like your daddy, Lord, if not more like me. Say hey to your mom. Don't let us stop you. We just jiving Jarvis.

I can see it written all over your face. You look like somebody who could really make a difference in this world. Well I got a friend named Jarvis, and he got a mission. Crazy one, but at least it's a mission. And, what's that? He wants to be the first Negro paper press manager at Jennings. His daddy never could get it. He's been saying for years he's gonna get that job. Old Thomas Cook senior would be crying tears from the heavens above if he ever did get it. There ain't no order too tall for God if you believe. You do believe, don't you? Well... Now look it's getting late. I really have to go. I have to work first shift in the morning. Wait! Can I see you again? Let me take you out sometime. Be at my job before first shift, and we can talk about just where it is you want to take me. Now I want to see you, so remember don't be late. Oh hell no.

Well there's a first time for everything. Follow my damn lead. Hey, hey, Jericho, hey look at this, man? What is it? Ain't that Miss Johnson's grandson that's been missing since last week? Not that I knew of. I can't place the face. Stop playing. You know that's him. Maybe I do remember him just a little bit. You know maybe he got lost or ran away from home. Shit, I don't know.

Come on, let's get the hell outta here. Wait a minute. Hey, you think they saw us? Hell no, absolutely not. No way, no how. Then why you running so damn fast?

Ain't you got something better to do than looking down my Goddamn throat? Get inside now! You mention a word of this to anybody, and I'll hang your ass right next to him. I thought I recognized that boy. They got signs posted everywhere looking for his black ass. Y'all gonna go all the way? Or, you gonna send him home all beat to shit for a message to those other coons? Mama look here these niggers are everywhere. Now this whole bullshit Civil Rights Act done passed, they'll be eating at our restaurants and going to our schools. And before long, making babies with our old ladies. Not this old lady.

I'll hang that burly nigger and shoot him dead before I ever and the thought of... Now Marcel, all I'm saying is... Let's go. How'd you like some coon pounding your old lady out? Yeah, I thought so. You're one crazy son of a bitch. Man, if I didn't know no better, I thought you was a real life sure enough hillbilly standing behind me. And, all that shit you was talking about going to busting up his old lady. I damn near had to bite my tongue. Jarvis, don't worry about it. I didn't mean a word of it. I made all that shit up. Damn man. Fooling with this shit, missed our interview, a whole day's work. Maybe so, maybe at least we can save our damn jobs. God damn, ain't no way that niggers gonna make a fool outta me. Hurry your slow driving ass up, shit! Hell Marcel, I'm driving as fast as I can! Oh man. What? Jarvis, you ever wanted something so bad you could taste it? Yeah I guess so. Well I got the newspaper this morning, and this place had half off a chicken dinner. What you think about that? Well Jericho that sounds good n'all, and I hear what you saying, but don't you see that big ass sign right there? And, I don't this it's a misprint. I think they meant to right that shit exactly like it says. I'm so tired of this, Jarvis! Tired of what? This! Tired of being told I can't do this or that or go here or there all because I'm a Negro. Guess what. What? Today two of the blackest jokers this town's ever seen is gonna sit down and have a chicken dinner. After all, I am white if only for a day. Hey look. They gonna think it's a full eclipse when we take your black ass off in there. Hell no, I'm not going off in there. You ain't gonna get me killed. You done tried once today. I'm not going off in there. Now Jarvis, look, if we ain't dead after all the shit we done been through, one piece of chicken ain't gonna be the straw that broke the camel's back. Only question is do you want yours smothered or extra crispy? Boy, didn't you see that big ass sign out there? Yes mam, I saw it. But, I thought since the Civil Rights Act was just passed today, I'd come on in and have me a meal. You see it says so right here in the newspaper. And, right next to it is your ad for half off a chicken dinner. Well news travels slow around these parts. People ain't even read it here yet. And, frankly I don't give a shit what it says. We don't serve your kind in here no way, no how. You best be moving on. But mam, you can't deny my a chicken dinner. I'm gonna deny you your last breath if you don't get your ass out of my diner! Wait. ♪ Do the rooster ♪ Shake your tail feather now ♪ Do the rooster Now I think that's the moment Jericho realized how much fun he could have as Dale. And, she enjoyed every square inch of it. ♪ Shake your tail feather now ♪ Do the rooster Hey I've been looking for you all damn day. Sir, I'm not even sure what I just seen there, but I mean I understand he's your help n'all, but he ain't got no business here in this restaurant. Help? Why this is my son-in-law right here, and he's been screaming about a piece of chicken all damn day every since he saw the ad in the paper. Why don't you go fetch him a drumstick or two, darling? Did you say son-in-law? You know what, I never thought you'd amount to much. I'll never forget the night I come home, we found you fiving a pushing to my daughter's cushion. Pushing to her cushion? What is this shit? I'm not putting up with it. Now Gertrude, I've been eating here for 30 years. Is this what this come to us sharing spoons with niggers? Let's go. That's it! Get him outta here! You boys are running off good paying customers. Okay, we'll leave, but I don't see no more than two cars parked outside and one of 'em is yours. Now business ain't exactly booming around here. Now Jim Crow going away is good for everybody. I know a town full of Negroes that just love home cooking like this here which means more business for you. And, I also know Negroes that need jobs because guess what when business starts picking up like I know it will a lot more dishes need washing, a lot more biscuits need bacon, baby. You better get with the damn times, Gertrude. Oh! Agnes, Agnes! Where's that nigger? I'll kill him. Ain't no niggers been by here since y'all chased them off this morning. Agnes, are you okay? Yes baby, I'm fine. I'm gonna kill the first nigger I see, and I know just where to look. ♪ I wanna spin around ♪ Spin around ♪ About 180 degrees, do an about face ♪ ♪ Start stepping as I march in place ♪ ♪ Get ready and prepare to lead ♪ ♪ Gotta take up my sleeves ♪ They wanna make it hard to breath ♪ ♪ Got a blast all our enemies ♪ I won't tell no mind to my teacher ♪ ♪ Alibi with the preacher ♪ Let me tell you what I'm gonna do ♪ ♪ But I won't dog you ♪ I gotta make change ♪ All by myself ♪ I gotta find the best in me ♪ People look at me strange ♪ Like I lost my mind In all my years, I ain't never heard no mess like this before.

EJ! Where is he? Marcel, look at this! Jarvis. What? Looks like they're in between shifts. I can't go in there like this. Yeah, you right. Now would be the perfect time for me to get all this stuff off my face. Okay. See you in a minute. All right. Don't you two have some explaining to do? Mr. Munson, I know we late, but I can explain. It was all my fault. You see I had the runs real bad this morning. I was fresh out of shit paper, but this man. This man right here, gave me the shirt off his back so I could wipe my own ass. So that's why we late because that's the kind of human being he is. The integrity, the fortitude of this human being right here. Mr. Munson, I can explain look... Then we got robbed by a gang of midgets. They stole my car. Then they crashed it into a tree 'cause the bastards couldn't see over the steering wheel. Mr. Munson, Mr. Muson look... My daddy gave me that car. Mr. Munson look it was all my fault. Okay now I know I should've made it here on time, but, you see, the truth is I really need that promotion. If I get that job, I can really change my family's life. Mr. Munson, you know I can do that job. I just need you to believe in me. Please sir. I'm sorry, son. I've already given that job to somebody else. Now listen you're an excellent worker. Everybody here knows it. But, there's nothing more I can do. Maybe next time, son. Now I've got the second shift starting in 15 minutes, and I reckon I can use you two on that shift. That is if you could still use a day's work, but you guys look a mess. Go get changed into some clean uniforms and head out to the station with the new crew. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. I tell you right now, reverend. We've got to do something! We just can't sit around here and let these monsters abduct and murder our children. And, just exactly what would you have us do, Greg huh? What in Jesus's name can we do? If we retaliate, we'll all be dead before sundown. I suggest we just stay out the way and let things blow over. Blow over? Man, they done damn near killed this boy right here, ain't no telling what in the hell they've done to these people here, and you want to let it blow over? Hell that could've been one of our kids, could've been one of your kids or your kids. And, even yours Reverend Aberdeen. And, this all because the color of our skin. Well I say we don't just sit back. We've gots to do something before they slowly but surely wipe out what's left of us. You know what, damn it, I'm pissed now! I'm mad as hell. We've got to do something. I say let's take the fight to them! Let's take the fight to them! Let's take the drama to their mamas, how 'bout that? See how it feel, huh! Let's take the heat and not damn retreat. Let's bring the thunder and let them wonder. And, let's bring the pain and make it rain. Y'all crazy. You gonna get yourself killed. No, Mr. Montgomery. Hey, now that's what I'm talking about. You done ignited a fire inside me this afternoon, Mr. Parsons. Huh? I'm gonna be following right behind you. Follow me? Oh hell no, I'm too old for this shit. I was just giving y'all some ideas of some stuff y'all can do. I'm gonna sit my black ass down over there, and I'm gonna pray for y'all. Reverend Aberdeen gonna lead y'all to victory. Aint' that right, Reverend Aberdeen? Ain't that right, Reverend Aberdeen? I said ain't that right, Reverend Aberdeen, ain't that right? Say Jarvis? Yeah. Man, I'm really sorry about everything. I mean the promotion, all the trouble I caused you today. I know it's my fault you didn't get that job today. I never wanted things to end up like this. And, all because I was too lazy to take the safe route to get here. You know Jericho, don't even worry about it. I mean you are lazy, but none of this could've happened if I didn't let it. Could've put my foot down and stopped us from going through Mr. Edwards's land. Oh you don't think I could've stopped you? Look I know I like to play it safe, but I guess at the end of the day, I just want to take a leap of faith. And, I appreciate you for being that loose cannon that always pushed me, you know? Always ready and willing to take a chance. I mean things didn't work out, but just think if it did. Look in this messed up world we live in every Negro around here is scared, scared to take a chance, and as a result, there ain't no progress being made, none. This town needs more men just like you. Yeah, just like you who ain't scared, scared to take a chance, who ain't afraid of the dangers around the corner or the road less traveled. Whatever the case, I'm just thankful you're my best friend. I mean you did save my life today. I did. Look finish getting dressed. I'm gonna go on out and get started on prepping the machine. All right man. Don't wanna screw this second chance we got. One thing I know for sure ain't no third shit around this place. Man, you got that shit right. All right, I'll see you out there. Thank you, man, thank you. ♪ I waited all my life ♪ To find a reason why ♪ Am far too tired to fight ♪ I couldn't even try ♪ Broken in a way ♪ No one could ever know Jericho, your friend's in trouble. These white men are after 'em. I think they're gonna kill him. Baby, it's gonna be all right, I promise you. Now you wait right here. What the hell's all the damn commotion going on around here? Hit him, boy, hit him! Jericho? Jericho? Help! Marcel? What's the meaning of all this? You have no right to come on this property and do this to my workers! I'll have you arrested! Wait, I'm on your side, shit! All right Buford, let him go. Clark, this ain't your fight. I suggest y'all go back and mind your own business. Man, what the hell is going on? Get your hands off that boy. Ain't you got no respect for human life? I oughta blow your Goddamn brains out for all the heartache you guys done caused around here. Am I hearing you correctly, sir? If you'd've hung this nigger when you were supposed to, we wouldn't be here. Now I don't know how he got loose, but I reckon he ain't gonna get away this time. Why didn't you kill him? I guess 'cause deep down I ain't no killer, and besides we got a lot in common. Oh really? What could you two possibly have in common? You just can't kill him, and I'm gonna leave it at that. Why? I'm gonna tell you why! 'Cause it's gonna take all that you've got to stop this boy from killing your ass, and I mean that in a good Christian way especially this one right here. Boy, y'all damn near killed today, this man only son. He don't talk too much, but one thing we know for sure. He ain't too happy. Get him, boy, get him! Yeah! Get him, baby! You make sure you make them pay for what they did to our boy. You get back here! Get him, baby. All right Buford, I think they had about enough. Well maybe just a little bit more. Come on Buford, get him. Come on Buford, get him. Get him, Buford. Come on, man. Stop, stop. Stop! Now many years ago, I tried to keep my boy from standing up for anything that was right. I guess I just didn't think that things could ever get better for Negroes. Maybe I didn't want him to know how proud I was of him. So I never said nothing. Now that's my grand baby you know was hurting, and he didn't do nothing but try to walk in his daddy's footsteps. Now Thomas was the best employee this factory ever had. He told me how he helped build it up to what it is today. I was scared that y'all'd do to him what y'all's doing to Jarvis. So I never let him know that he was good, but it was too late. He was great. He was God's gift to me, his family, and this factory. And, they made us pay for it. I lost two people that I loved behind this foolishness. So I know the pain that she speaks of. You see when you've gone through so much for so long, you grab ahold of anger and bitterness, and then it becomes your friend, and it shields ya. It shields ya so that you don't feel the hurt anymore. But, it also keeps the good from getting in. Now here y'all are still hanging onto the bitterness and anger. Shame on ya, shame on all of you. You're just like them. Now this thing has got to stop right now. She's right. Them two were in my diner earlier today, and that man, he asked that other man to marry his daughter. And, I ain't never been too fond of Negroes, but well I figure if he's good enough for his daughter, maybe we oughta give this idea of us all getting along another look. So starting tomorrow, y'all are welcome in my diner. Thank you Jesus. Daddy, no. Mildred, you're not supposed to be here. Go on now. Why daddy, why? Is it because they look like me? Are you ashamed of me, of mommy? Well I'll be damned. Take her out of here. You don't understand. That's different. I gotta protect what's mine. I gotta protect our future. That nigger mama of yours was asking for it. You monster! She mine now. Mildred is mine, Agnes is mine. Just like little Cody, I gotta protect him from y'all. I'm just a scared old Negro from Minden Hall. I'm a real bad shot, and I got terrible aim. But, here's what I got going for me at the particular moment. I got this big ass gun to the back of your head so I can't miss it if I tried. Nigger, you ain't got it in you. Oh, he ain't the one you got to worry about. And, I won't hesitate. Just go ahead and try me. Y'all can just go to hell. Greg, you know my gun wasn't even loaded? Shit, mine wasn't either. But, the ass end of the snug nose is one hit or quit, ain't it? I knocked the hell out of that. I knocked his monkey ass out. Let me through. Sheriff, these men are responsible for the torture of this young boy. I saw the whole damn thing, and I wouldn't be surprised if they kidnapped and murdered other Negroes in the surrounding community. You willing to testify to that, sir? You damn right I will. Long as they keep making this damn paint. Sir, I don't think I got your name. Dale Stevens. That is the weirdest thing. There used to be an old used car salesman I used to listen to when I was a kid with that exact same name, and you sound just like him, any relation? I never heard of the guy. Anyway, you take care, sir. You too, sheriff. Come on, Jarvis. Thank you, Mr. Munson. Thank you. Here let's get that off of you. Well son, Thomas Cook was your father? Yes sir, he taught me everything I know. I haven't heard that name in almost 20 years which is about as long as he's been with the Lord I suppose. So many Cooks around here, I never would've guessed. Thomas Cook was not only the best paper press operator I've ever seen, but he was one of the very best men I ever knew. Hell he trained me. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have had a job. I mean that machine would just stop running all of a sudden, and we'd all be standing around scratching our heads trying to figure it out. And, he would just walk up. In a matter of seconds, it was up and running again. When I bought this company, first thing I said I was gonna do was try and get him that promotion, but the law prevented it. I don't know how this company would've made it through those early years without him. To tell you the truth, I don't know how I'll make it now without you. You've got those same qualities, son. Go home Jarvis, I'll see you in the morning. In the morning, sir? What about the second shift? I need my new paper press manager to be well rested. He's got a long day ahead of him. Yes sir. You bet, good man. Yes sir! And, all is well in this little Mississippi town. Jarvis got his promotion and lived out a dream that his father never could have with his best friend Jericho by his side. So grandpa, whatever happened to those evil men, Marcel, Toby, and Larry? Well let's just say they were welcome with open arms at their new place of residence. Fortunately for you boys, Jim Crow passed a little bit too early. Governors already mandated that all jailhouses be integrated. I just got one question. What you in here for? And, Jarvis and Jericho lived happily ever after, the end. Well now actually, that was only the beginning. Hey Jarvis, everything okay? You're usually the first man here. Yes sir, Jericho's car broke down again. But, believe me it was an easier walk to work today. But hey, I've been saving for a car ever since I got this job so I won't have to worry about that much longer. I know that, and I'm proud of your patience. But, I've been thinking about a way to help you. Seeing as I sold the company last week, I'll be retiring soon. Well I didn't wait too much longer to do this. What's this, boss? That's your new ride to work, son. Got the car at the house all ready to go. You just come on by and pick it up this afternoon after the shift ends. Thank you, Mr. Munson. Don't mention it. Thank you, sir! Least I can do for a hard worker like you. Jericho, I got me a car! I got me a car! Oh my damn. Isn't this what you've been waiting for all your damn life? Yes. My, my, my! Do you like it? Shit yeah! I mean yes sir, we love it. Don't we, Jarvis? Mr. Munson, it's the most beautiful car I've ever seen. I agree. I thought you would like it. But, that ain't it. Come on, come on over here. Well I think y'all are gonna like this one just as well. I keep the oil changed, start it up every now and then, but it runs great. Been in the family for years. Mr. Munson, where'd you get this car? Mr. Munson, I said where did you get this car? Like I said Jarvis, it's been in the family for years. It was my first car. Mr. Munson, forgive me if I don't take too kindly to this here gift. This car was used in the murder of my brother, my only brother. Daddy was never the same after that night. In fact, I don't even think he smiled again even on the happiest of days. My brother was my mother and father's only hope to go off to college and study medicine. He was gonna be a doctor, Mr. Munson. I'll never forget the day we found him hanging from that tree. I'm so sorry for your loss son. I remember that night also. I never thought he would've... I never should have trusted Johnny with my car. Johnny? You talking about old man Edwards? Yeah unfortunately, he's my brother-in-law. He said he was gonna celebrate after getting that promotion at the mill. You know they'd always despised your father for all the good he'd done around the factory. And, he never thought Johnny deserved that promotion over him. And, he was right. But, when he filed that complaint, he always said he was gonna teach him a lesson. I just shrugged it off. I never thought it would amount to much. I guess I'm as much to blame. Have you no shame? What in God's name have you done, Johnny? What's the matter there, brother-in-law? You ain't never been out on an evening ride with your young'un, had a deer jump out on you before? Marcel, you go inside and get ready for bed. Yes, uncle Clark. Right now. Marcel! He had an aneurism later that night. He used to have so much to say, now he can't say a word. Been trapped in a broken body for 20 years now. I'm gonna kill him. No, man, no. I'm gonna kill him! No, Jarvis. Jarvis, I know it hurt. I know you're upset, but killing that man would be a blessing to him right now. God, done already took justice out on him before he could go to bed at night and smile about what he did. Think about what grandma said. Jericho's right Jarvis. There ain't nothing I can say to bring your brother back, but there is something I can do. Man, can you believe Mr. Munson gave me his prized possession? I mean can you believe that? It wasn't his fault, but to take responsibility for his family, now that's a good man there, Jarvis. Say he said he left something else for me in the glove compartment. Open it up. Got your name on it. Yes! Yes! Thank you Jesus! Woo! Can you believe that, Jarvis? Mr. Munson sold you the paper mill for about the same price as a pack of pork chops. Well I'm gonna tell you right now as my new boss, I'm gonna be late tomorrow morning. And, that was how it went. Wow grandpa, that was amazing. I mean it was like we were right there in the struggle. Oh Percy, Mr. Spurling you are a fantastic storyteller and all with one single picture. I want to thank you for sharing that with us. Let's give Mr. Spurling another hand. You didn't think I was gonna let you get out of here without knowing who I am, did you? My name is Elijah Spurling. That's a nasty cut you got there. But, my friends call me EJ.
