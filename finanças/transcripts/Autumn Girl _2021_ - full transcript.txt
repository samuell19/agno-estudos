NETFLIX PRESENTS A FILM CO-FINANCED BY THE POLISH FILM ART INSTITUTE LIFE IN THE LIMELIGHT! KALINA JĘDRUSIK REVEALS SECRETS THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM DID NOT NECESSARILY HAPPEN The 1960s woman, she should be stylish yet modest. - Mmm. - Flamboyant yet modest. - Yeah. - Chic yet modest. And always devoted to hearth and home. Gabardine. Moire. Crimplene. Taffeta. And damask. Whoa. - Don't step on the cracks. - Careful! All right, give me the keys. Mmm. Mmm. Oh God. I wonder where did I put them. - Come on. - Wait. Oh, fuck it! For God's sake! Have you got a torch? Funnily, not. I've got a lighter. Give it here, will you? Right. Hang on. For fuck's sake, Staś, you're gonna set my hair on fire. Watch it. Ugh! Oh God, I've lost them again. Magda! Magda! Well, if it isn't Ms Young Jędrusik! What's all this noise about? We've lost our keys, Mrs Klimczakowa. Why are you yelling outside my window? You'll wake everybody up. Why are you being so horrid? Show some manners for once. Because you're drunk and rolling around in the road. I've never seen anything like it. You should be ashamed of yourself! Oh yeah? What about my husband? Why are you always shouting? Because you're a gobby little smart-arse. Well, if I'm gobby, you're the biggest cow in the whole block. How dare you! What's so funny? Why didn't you say anything? Kalinka, I don't argue with angry women in windows. And if you don't pipe down I'll call the police. - Your voice is too loud! - It's not. You're a drunken stumbling mess. Oh yeah? Think you're some big television star, do you? You're just a drunk. Why aren't you saying anything? You're just standing there all quiet like a statue. Magda! - Magda! - What? You want the keys again? Thank you. Can I come over? It's 3:00 in the morning. Thanks, Magda. - You're an angel. - Not at all. - Come on, Krzyś. Back to bed. - Can I come over when I get up? Of course you can. Oh, Fluffy! There you are. Well, now. I'm coming! CAFÉ Yes, we'd like some... I don't get it. How are you always so slim? I hardly eat anything and I keep getting fatter. It's driving me nuts. I'm not slim at all. I'm just good at holding my stomach in. I should really go on a diet. There's no way I'm going on a diet. Oh, and, uh, why not? I might get saggy tits instead of a smaller arse. - You're gonna eat that? - Mmm, take it. Shall we? Hang on. - Kalina. - What? I've been thinking about dying my hair blonde. - You? Blonde? - Hmm. You always make fun of fake blondes. Yeah, well, I changed my mind. Mmm. You should use peroxide. It's great. Although it does completely fuck up your hair. - So what's Janusz done now? - Janusz? Oh, come on, it's obvious. Do you like this? I'm not a pensioner. I'd never wear gabardine. It's crimplene. What an underwhelming selection! Don't be too picky, or you'll end up singing for those miners in the nude. Actually, they might enjoy that. Ah. Here. It's perfect. Little bit depressing, though, isn't it? Not if I give it a stunning neckline. Forty zlotys a metre. Fuck that! I'm not made of money, am I? So we'll take two metres. I'll pay. Aren't you sweet. Thank you. Ah. This neckline would really suit you. Thank you. I'm telling you, it's Jędrusik. - It can't be. She's too ugly. - I'm telling you, it's her. I've never liked her, you know.

It most certainly does. You all right? - Hello. - Coffee? Oh yeah. I'll have one too. Mmm. Ireland beat us 2-0. But they're still saying we played the better game. So we played the best, but then so did they. Ridiculous. Everyone played best. Shall I go? Hello, Mr Marian. Oh, hello there. Still popular with the ladies, I see. Twenty postcards today. Can't help it. Sorry. They keep playing my song on the radio. Yeah. My daughter puts it on full volume whenever she hears your voice. Anyway... See you. Yeah. Goodbye. Mmm. Kalinka, it looks like you've got some competition. Hmm. "I love you and your voice." "I love you... and your voice." "I can't sleep. I can't stop thinking about you." "Please, please, would you send me an autograph with a dedication." "I think you're gorgeous." "Yours sincerely, Jagódka." "I think you're gorgeous." I might use that. - Hello. Hi. - Hello. Don't step on the black squares. - But the snails don't live there. - They do. - Be careful. Don't crush them. - What's for lunch? - I don't know. Looks weird. - It's a recipe from Bombay. Where? From far away. You don't have to eat if you don't want to. Lovely. And where is Bombay? You don't know? What do they teach you in school? I'm too young to go to school. That's right. You're too young. I am. I'll let you off this once. 2:15. Tadzio. Mmm, yummy. Hello? No. No. Wrong number. Goodbye. Tadzio is running late. That's not like him. Ula, are you gonna finish that? DECEMBER 4, 1962 MINER'S DAY Hello, my artist comrades. - Good evening. - Good evening. Very nice to see you. All right. So how are we? A little stage fright, but I'm all right. I'm not frightened. I'm on after Jędrusik. So no one's gonna listen to me anyway. Jędrusik? You mean Kalina Jędrusik? Yes. She makes such an impact that once it's over nothing else matters afterwards. Ah! Forgive me. Allow me to introduce my successor, Ryszard Molski. He'll be head of television entertainment from now on. Mieczysława Burska. Pleasure. - Marek Nowakowski. - Pleasure. So what's next for you, Director? Well, I'm now moving up to the top floor. Now I'll be running the entire television station. Well, quite a promotion. Congratulation. Do you know where she is? In the dressing room, warming up. If she can be bothered, that is. Actually we used to perform together. THEATER BUFFET Oh, a fellow actor in our midst. Though you're... a director now. So you're intimate with Jędrusik. He's a lucky man. Not everyone can say that. Let's not exaggerate, Comrade Mikosz. She just used to have a... bit of a soft soft for me. I wouldn't mind if she had a soft for me as well, I'm telling you. All right. Stand by, everyone. And can I have the folk band on the stage, please? Ah. Shall we go? - To see Kalina? - To see the show. How do I look? Absolutely fantastic. You don't think the neckline's a little bit low? It has to be low though, especially when I'm on the stage. My neck is short and I am short, so I'd look like a little mushroom if my neckline was any higher. Well, maybe a little. Not a little bit, a lot. Anyway, no need to be polite with me. Oh God, it's time. Shit! And I keep bloody forgetting the second stanza of the lyrics. Oh please! You know them by heart. Kick me for good luck? Fuck's sake! My arse is way too big. Kalina Jędrusik, this is your five-minute call. I'm going now. ...this wonderful night. A huge thank you to all our folk musicians And now let's bring on the star of the show. Dearest comrades, the hard-working mining heroes of our homeland, and you, their honoured wives. Please welcome by special request\ of the working class, Kalina Jędrusik!

Can I have your autograph? 'Course you can, sweety. Kalinka! Kalinka! My sweet Kalinka! Kalinka, you were phenomenal. Marian! I could almost eat you. Oh, I wouldn't do that, darling. I'm so full of calories. - We have to go. - I don't care. No, not yet. You're like a juicy doughnut, so sweet I could gobble you up... You wouldn't want to spoil your appetite, would you? I'm sure your wife has a lovely dinner waiting for you at home. You have no shame! Keep your preppy hands off our men! Thank you. Well, hello there, my dearest Kalina! How the devil are you? Do I know you? Kalina! Really. You don't remember? No. We performed together at the seaside. Oh! Right! It's Molski. Rysiek Molski. Come on! Oh, Rysiek. Well, it's lovely to see you, but I'm busy so... Oh okay. I'll wait for you here. - What for? - You can join me for some dinner. I'm going back to Warsaw tonight. - My chauffeur will then take you back. - Oh. Chauffeur? Yeah. Because as it happens, I'm now head of television entertainment. - You're not. - I am. Oh shit. So how about dinner with your new exec? That's so kind. Though I'm having dinner with my husband in Warsaw. Really? Really. Mmm. Sure about that? I'm afraid so. Now that you're my boss though, I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of each other. SPATIF CLUB "Love has been a new experience for me." "Until now, all I cared about was boxing and science because I valued my independence." "Now I almost feel like someone who's never had any money and has suddenly... ...been given the keys to the bank." But you're always writing about love. And so am I, by plagiarising you. That's funny. I thought I was the one plagiarising you. People keep saying Dygat copying Konwicki. I hear that it's Konwicki who copies Dygat. Maybe you two shouldn't talk on the phone so often then. We talk when we need to. Hello. But you could call it artistic symbiosis. Will you mentor me? Young lady, I have enough to deal with. I'm taking care of a fellow named Tadeusz, which doesn't leave, um, much time for you. All right. Goodbye then. Tadzio, that girl was gorgeous. Wasn't she? I mean, for God's sake, what a stunner! Yes, of course she was, but beauty is nothing without intelligence. Well, that's a load of nonsense, isn't it? As long as she's pretty nothing else matters. Kaziu, you still have one or two things to learn yet about life. Yeah, and all the best life lessons come with vodka. - Three vodkas, please. - He's right. Vodka? It's not even midday. Surely we're not that extravagant. Oh shit! My rehearsal's at noon. Oh, hold on, you cretin. Can't you see I'm busy? Oi, move it now! Right. No need to shout. You'll give yourself a... My dear Kalinka, our favourite star! Oh my! Hello. You're looking just as gorgeous as ever. - Have they started? - I'm afraid that they have. Are they angry? I think they will be more worried if you weren't late for once, don't you? Oh. Oh damn. Nothing like a good French lipstick. Yes. They're almost impossible to get ahold of. A real nightmare. Here you go. I got you some veal. Just a taster, but I know how much you love it. Oh, that's... that's... Oh, good afternoon, sir. Kalinka, you really are too kind. Excuse me, madam. Where did you get that meat? Yes, you. I'm asking you where you got that meat from? I have my sources. See you later. Do you have to simper over her like that? So what's your problem with her, Krystyna? Come on. Well, I don't know. Maybe all that veal is making you soft in the head or something. Hello, there. Ms Ula told us to wait. Hello. Mwah! Oh, the Autumn Girl. How kind of you to join us. Jeremi was about to ask the receptionist to fill in for you. You're on thin ice. You know that. Sorry. I do try not to be late, but I don't wear a watch. We're rehearsing your scene in ten minutes. Yes, of course. Here, let me. Yes, another man, he's angry at me. Jeremi always looks angry. Not Jeremi. - Then who? - Actually, it was our new boss. You met him already? - Ugh. We used to perform together. - So? So, he was hitting on me. He's still got a thing for me. He cornered me after the show on Miner's Day and asked me out for dinner. And? I turned him down. He's so dull. Then, just now, I saw him in the corridor and he was sulking. Everyone says good things about him. He acts. He's on our side. Why not give him a chance? Go out for dinner. What? And let him lecture over me all over again? Or maybe he can come and have a vodka with us at SPATiF. Mmm. Well, maybe. Come on, just do it. We all need to get on with our boss. And he seems like a perfectly decent person. He knows he's not the best actor in the world. And he's charming. You know, just don't fall in love with him. Remember Janusz. - You were right. - About what? I think Janusz is sleeping with that dancer, Kamila. The ballet dancer with the long legs? That little bitch! That bitch is adorable. And she's clearly the best dancer in Warsaw. Best dancer in Warsaw? Bullshit. - She's a clumsy little cow. - Keep your voice down... I'll not keep it down. I can't stand posers like her. - Posers? - She's only pretending to be pretty. She can't dance. She actually has a bit of a hunch back. And a squint. And her legs are wonky. She dances like this. Aah! All right, everyone. The clock's ticking. Stand by for transmission, please. You're right. That is how she moves. - What are you working on right now? - I'll tell you. Mrs Marysia. Here you go, Tadzio. She's gonna be in my movie. Staś hates working. So Kalina, she has to lock him up in a room like some kind of very dangerous freak. Otherwise, he won't write anything. What's it about? - Well, love, obviously. - Hmm. So you're not writing about Poland? About everything that's happening? Why on earth would I want to write about everything that's happening? Ready? Here we go. Camera! Action! Sit down. ♪ I'm looking at you I can't see anyone else ♪ ♪ I'm looking at you I am not at all embarrassed ♪ ♪ To be looking at you ♪ ♪ I'm looking at you ♪ ♪ When at night I am awake I always look at you ♪ ♪ And when I look at other people I'm looking at you ♪ ♪ Like I look at the sunset ♪ ♪ Or the smoke above distant roofs ♪ ♪ Like I closely look at Raindrops on willow leaves ♪ ♪ I'm looking at you ♪ ♪ With the green light of my eyes I'm marking you ♪ ♪ So that you feel my stare I'm looking at you ♪ ♪ So that you look at me and see So that you realise what it means ♪ ♪ To be looking at you this way ♪ Isn't she wonderful? - Finally. - That was good. That was divine. Rysiek, lovely to see you. Look, I'm sorry about not going out for dinner. You're not angry, are you? I thought you would appreciate the invitation. - I'm not just anybody. - No, of course you're not. And I don't want you and I to get off on the wrong foot. I'm going to make it up to you. Oh? - How's that? - Why don't we go for a vodka? Everyone's going after the show. Everyone? Rysiek, you're a boss. It's hardly a surprise that everyone wants to meet you. No? - I suppose you do have a point. - Well, that's fantastic. They're a brilliant team, you'll see. SPATiF. Good evening. Holoubek? No, he's not here. You haven't changed, Kalina. You're just as you always were. Sheer magnetic. - Oh, don't say that, Rysiek. - No, I mean it. On Miner's Day, the whole audience was staring at you. It's almost like you hypnotized them. I've always been really jealous of her charisma. Oh, Rysiek, please. Maybe you weren't quite as terrible as everyone said you were. I just wasn't cut out for acting in the end. Maybe you're just a natural-born director. - Well, I'm nothing like you, Kalina. - Oh, come on. No, I mean it. You're beautiful, talented, and what's more, the whole world's in love with you. There's something about you that's just completely unforgettable. Stop it, Rysiek. Please. Fucking hell! What is it? Look at that fur. Come on, Kalina. She's not nearly as pretty as you. But I don't have that fur, do I? Do you have any idea how expensive those things are? And a star like you can't afford it? Really? No, Rysiek. And that's because you pay peanuts so your stars can't afford nice clothes. Ah, so that's why you perform with no clothes on. You got it. You'll get your fur. - Yeah? - Yes. Come. I'm your boss. Now you do as I say. Oh. Well, if it's an order, I probably should. Good evening, Mr Franio. Evening, Mr Henio. Anything fresh left on the menu? Be honest. Honestly, I would suggest you try the steak tartare. I don't like tartare. If the steak tartare is not to your liking, I would recommend a vodka for the gentlemen. Oh, now that I like. Yeah, let's go to the bar. - Thank you, Franio. - You're welcome. My dear Franio, this lady would like to try on that fur coat. I'm sorry. I don't have one available at the moment. But I can try to find you one. - What type? - Not to buy. Just to try on. That one, there. Sir, this isn't a clothing store. But it is though, isn't it? Look, I'm sorry. It belongs to the ambassador's wife... Look, Franio. I'm willing to pay you very well indeed for your service. You won't regret it. I can lose my job for this. What? Don't you like me? Oh, you're wonderful. It's just... - I still prefer my job. - Really? Ugh. Okay, fine. We'll call it a secret between the three of us, shall we then? Oh my God, look at it! - It's so soft. It's lovely. - Come on. Put it on. There. Well? Incredible. What about me? How's this? Well... - Pretty handsome, actually. - Yeah? - It's a little bit tight, though. - And mine's too big. Let's switch. I adore you, Kalina. I adore you. Please call me Stefan. - Will you sing for me? - What? Sing for me like you do in the studio. I wasn't singing in the studio there, was I? I was miming to playback. Well, now you can really sing for me, yeah? Rysiek, no, I don't want you to hear me sing out of tune. - Sing for me. - Mmm! Sing for me. ♪ I'm looking at you... ♪ ♪ I see no one else ♪ ♪ I'm looking at you ♪ ♪ Not ashamed at all ♪ ♪ To be looking at you ♪ Kalina, do you think you can love me? No, Rysiek, I couldn't. Why not? Stop it. Let's get out of here, shall we? - Why? I want to make love to you. - Rysiek! - Kalina, I want to make love to you. - Rysiek! - Just for one night, that's all. - No fucking way! Stop it! Rysiek! Stop it! I said no! Get off! - Stop it! - And why not? You love to sleep around. Everyone knows that. Rysiek! My sex life is my business. So stay out of it. Good night, Ms Kalinka. Good night, Mr Franio. - Hello. - Hello, there. Hi. Hello! Hello! Jesus Christ! What are you doing in here? I'm not dead, am I? No. I'm pretty sure you're still alive. How did you get in here? I'm not really here at all. I'm an apparition, my child. We're just gonna sit here, are we? I'm just here to make you feel anxious, that's all. Oh, of course. Be my guest. Mmm. So what should I be anxious about? Ah, you'll have to find out for yourself. Hmm. Ah. - Hello. - Hi. Welcome to our beautiful country. Well, well. My name is Nina. Fuck me, I didn't know they spoke Chinese in here. Actually, it's Vietnamese. We had a delegation come here and I learned some. Isn't it lovely? Yeah, lovely. What other phrases do you know? Uh... Cm n bn. It means "thank you." Cm n... - ...bn. - bn. Please. Yes? Yes. Possibly. But really, there's no need to grovel. It's a little embarrassing. Yes. I know I can be strict, but I'm also fair. Well, in the end, that is my decision, as you very well know. Good then. Bye. I see you're late as usual, Ms Kalina. You're very formal all of a sudden. As you're well aware, I have a great deal of respect for you, Ms Kalina. - In fact, I'm very fond of you. - Yeah, I'm well aware of that. Would you like anything? - Not right now. - Coffee with sugar. Though, sadly, I've been forced to suspend all your future television appearances. Is that so? And who's forcing you? The people. - The people? - Yes, the people. We're receiving a huge number of complaints. People don't want to watch you. And why is that, may I ask? They're offended. By the dress you wore on Miner's Day. Offended by your low... neckline. By you. Everything about you. Rysiu, not so long ago you said that they all loved me. Ms Kalina... ...the nation has rejected you. The people have spoken and they have made their decision. - Which fucking people? - All of us. Your husband did his very best to convince you that everyone loves you because he wanted you to become Poland's answer to Marilyn Monroe. Unfortunately, you believed him. But the truth is the people don't want you, Kalina. Believe me. I take no pleasure in seeing a talent like yours go to waste. But there's nothing I can do. Now, I must ask that you refrain from visiting or entering any Polish television premises until further notice. Thank you, Rysiek. Well, that's great. Looks as if you finally found your ideal job. Can't really say if it's good or not. You said yourself recently that I'm not a good... My expertise lies directly... Apart from my perspective... I don't know how they will react to it. - What's wrong? - I suppose you'll find out. - He fucking fired me. - What? I'm not allowed on the television. He tried to fuck me and obviously, I turned him down. Can you keep it down, all right? - Keep it down? - I'm talking to Tadzio! You're always talking to Tadzio! Lucek, see how jealous she gets. That little shit just fired her. Didn't he? Why is that? She turned him down. Ah. - You think that's funny? - Well, a little. You do seem to attract your fair share of idiots. Oh, so it's my fault? Kalinka, just give it to me back. Is that all you have to say to me? What else am I meant to say? To hell with that randy little bastard. He's the one who made a fool of himself, not you. He fired me from the studio. All right, look. This guy is not important. He's just a desk clerk. Today it's Molski, tomorrow it'll be someone else. But you're irreplaceable. So please don't get hysterical. You know I don't like it. You should call Jeremi. I'm not calling anyone, all right. The line's always busy anyway. You're very attractive, and a lot of men really just don't know how to handle it. Like Lucek. Hello? What are you going to do? Don't know. Maybe I'll bash his brains in. You hear that, Tadzio? Just let it go, Kalinka. Seen my short story anywhere? Which one? You know, the one I read when people ask what I'm working on. Ah, the one that you keep as a backup. - That's the one. - I'll get it. ♪ I feel bad, I feel sad, I feel bleak ♪ ♪ Days are dragging like spaghetti So to speak ♪ ♪ We're out in the rain And in the breeze ♪ ♪ Soaking wet Just like birds in the trees ♪ ♪ With wet socks and wet stockings ♪ ♪ My soles came off I can't carry on walking ♪ ♪ I'm now worried that your parents could Stop me from seeing you ♪ ♪ I feel bad, I feel sad, I feel bleak ♪ Thanks. Appreciate it. Have we got a white one? What do you need it for? For Kaziu Kutz. Are you coming? - Hey, Kalina. - Hi, Kaziu. You'll be needing this. Are you saying I need a wash? No, it's a prop. You'll need it for the book signing. What the hell am I gonna do with a towel? Just imagine that I'm a boxer and that you Kaziu are my trainer. And we're going to a fight. A fight. Now you're talking. In fact, writing Lake Constance was quite a painful process for me because the protagonist's captivity is so unmanly. It's not funny. I mean it. Captivity, the kind we experience every day is quite shameful, effeminate, and beyond our control, and strips us of the will to fight. Back then, I really believed that. I have a question. What would you say the current trends are in our Polish literature? No idea. No, but seriously. No, I really don't know. I don't believe anyone does. Writers have to write, simple as that. Maybe they have views to express. Believe me, a lot of the time they write even when they have nothing to say. The only reason they're writing is to prove to the world they're writers. And 'cause they want to keep their jobs, of course. The problem with that is the characters they create are artificial. Hmm? They just don't seem real. I don't think you're being very fair. Well, of course, there are a few writers who are blessed with an irrepressible and authentic personality. And yes, they only write when they have something to say. But they're not part of a trend, they're just being themselves. Exactly. And what are these trends anyway? - Time's up! - Oh. Ladies and gentlemen, my trainer clearly thinks this question is too difficult for me. So I'm throwing in the towel. Thank you very much. - He's so arrogant. - I don't think so at all. He's charming. Thank you. Thank you. What's your view on the films of Ingrid Bergman? I think they're good. Pleasure meeting you all. - Thank you. - Goodbye. See you. - What do you think about Bergman's movies? - Well, yes, up there with the greats. - How do you do it? - Do what? You ridicule them, and they all love you for it. I don't ridicule them. Do I? Of course not. I just don't take them seriously. Or myself. Ah. Here. Nobody wants to buy me vodka. Have there always been these many women in here? Yeah, it's always that less. The same old crowd of drunken tarts who order chicken and Melba. Ah. What can I get you? A bottle of vodka. Actually, make it two. - Anything else? - One cognac. And I'll have chicken and Melba as usual. Everyone, this is Maja. Bzowska Maja. Maja Bzowska. She's just graduated from theatre school. So, now she's happened to gain some experience in, well, in real life. You better not listen to Kaziu then. He doesn't know the first thing at all about real life. And neither do we. Well, I adore all three of you men. I think everything you do is incredible, honestly. I'm sure there's a huge amount I can learn from you. What an interesting concept. I wonder though, what my wife would say. Oh, darling, I am sorry. But my husband finds teaching a little challenging. You see, he's already tired from the vigorous tuition he's giving me. Maja, I would be more than happy to teach you whatever you want. Can I be in a film? - Of course you can. - Now you're talking. Of course you can be in a movie. Ah, cognac! Excellent! - I haven't even set the dates yet. - Two more. Ah. But actually, it's just as well, what, with this television theatre thing with Adam coming up. Oh yeah. Kalina, is it true? That Molski fired you. Jesus, Baśka! Give her a break and leave her alone. But everyone is already talking all about it. It's true, but it's truly nothing to worry about. I'm sure, in the end, he will come crawling back. Exactly. I'm sorry. I just couldn't believe it. Adam! You don't mind if I cut in? Feel free. Let us dance the night away together. By the way, I don't know the dates for the next lot of Cabaret rehearsals, but I can definitely be available. I'm all yours. Kalina, I thought they had already told you. Told me what? Well, it looks like someone in the upper ranks is pretty pissed off with you, you know? They said I had to swap you for somebody else... Oh, don't worry then. Forget... Let's get the fuck out of here. Hey! Hey! - Godo evening. - Where to? - Wherever you're going. - All right. Hop in. Get on! Come on! Quick! MUNICIPAL BUS COMPANY DEPOT "A" End of the line. Off you get. "End of the line." - Bye. - Goodbye. - Have a good night. - Good night. Whoo! Whoo! Oh fuck! THE PARTY LISTENS TO THE PEOPLE Who does that arsehole think you are, huh? He said the country was offended by the dress I wore so he said he was gonna have to sack me for it. He's out for revenge. Pathetic little shit. So what now? Don't know. - Why didn't you talk it through... - And sleep with him? It wouldn't do any harm. You have to go and confront him, not just whine about... Oh, so you've confronted Janusz for cheating on you, have you? Sorry, Xymena, I didn't mean to sound so blunt. No, but you were. And I'm sure you're right. Xymena! Xymena! Oh, so you're here then. I was at the shops. What did you do that for, though? I've already been. I bought bread, butter, and eggs on your account. Just been shopping at the market. So what's wrong now? Why did you buy eggs? I've bought eggs from the farm like we agreed. And veal, and chicken, because that was your order. That's what I ordered? I haven't got any money on me. But you told me yourself I had to go to the shops. - I never said that, though. - Yeah! You said to me, "Before you clean, go and do the shopping..." No, I didn't. I only came into town to see you so I'm not going anywhere till you settle up. Same here. I want my money. So... Fuck's sake. Where's my husband? I'm being extorted by the veal woman and the housemaid. So we're going to pay, right? Staś, you go talk to them. - I'd rather stay out of it. - Why is that? - Because I'm a man. - Ah. He's scared of old women. He thought you had the money. I don't have any money. I'm stone broke. Well, so am I. Well, I can't help. If I could have, I would do it. That's very generous, Tadzio. I have bigger fish to fry. What are you doing here anyway? My phone's not working. So I came over to talk to Stanisław in person. We can't just sit here forever. Who says we can't. Good morning. What are you ladies doing waiting out here? I'm not leaving here until I get the money I'm owed. The same goes for me. I'm not going anywhere. Right. Let's see. So... For you. And for you. Is that enough? Oh yes. Thank you. Oh, it's so good to see you. We were trapped in the living room. What do you mean "trapped"? Was the door locked? What door? The living room door. Oh, sweety. You really are a s illy boy. You know this is a pool, don't you? For swimming in. I don't have to. I can just watch you splash. Uh-huh. So you're happy just not doing anything? Yes, quite happy, thank you. I'm getting used to doing nothing now apart from cooking and cleaning. Oh, for God's sake! Kalina! So then why don't you give Jeremi a call? He should stick up for you... I'm not calling anyone, all right? Asking for help is humiliating. You sound just like Staś. Stop pretending like you don't care, will you? Leave me alone. Just come for a swim. I don't want to swim. - Where are you going? - Leave me alone. I don't feel like swimming. I'll leave you alone. Just promise me one thing. And what's that? - That you'll call Jeremi. - God, you're stubborn. You really are! Ah! Here's our star. I really like these hats.

Now, Kalina, come and tell us exactly what happend. Come on. - Come with me. Come on. - Wacek! What are you doing? - Come on, only you can settle this. - You're crazy, as usual. Do you remember that time when Rysiek tripped over in the middle of a show... Good evening, Ms Nina. You look beautiful. Oh, thank you. That's very kind of you. Kalina, come on. Don't you remember? Right there, in the middle of the show, Rysiek tripped on a part of the set and fell flat on his face. Remember? And then you used your dress to cover him up and starting inventing some nonsense to say to me and I... and I said something totally daft to you in return. It happened, didn't it? Because Rysiek's denying it. You're drunk, Wacek. It's not Rysiek you're thinking of. It was actually Waldek Górski. I should go and mingle. Bye. Uh, would either of you like another drink? - No. - No, thank you. There you are, Kalina. - How you doing? - What do you think of tonight's show? It was good. That girl has real talent. Those crew neck dresses were beautiful, weren't they, babe? - You didn't really like them, did you? - Why? What's wrong with them? - It's just not your style. - No? That's interesting. You'd show your tits out there. Like this. What is your problem? I'm sorry, but you really haven't left me any choice, have you? I admit I'm a little rusty, but still, that was kinda perfect. Oh, good for you. Well, I'm sure it felt wonderful. Once you're a boxer then you're always a boxer. You should have let me wallop him too like this. Hey! Don't do that. Why not? How do you think it looks? How does what look? It's not really very womanly to go around punching people. If I was attracted to boxers then I, well, might have married my sparring partner. So you're saying a woman can't really defend herself because it looks ugly? Just leave it to the men. We're ugly already. So what should I do then? Just shut up and look pretty? I don't need you to save me. I'll save myself! You hear me? Oh, it's you again. Are you listening to me? Yelling in the street, as usual. Look, no offence, but you can't even save yourself from our grumpy neighbour, can you? What was that? You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Kalina, don't be stupid. Where are you going?

You watch me. Hello, Jeremi. Yes, so I was wondering is there any chance we could meet up tomorrow? At SPATiF? Yeah? That's great. At noon? Bye then. See you soon. I'm meeting him tomorrow. You don't give up, do you? No, I don't. Then don't you dare tell Staś about this. Hello. Kalina, I'm sorry. I waited in SPATiF for over an hour. It's me who should be sorry. But I'm glad I found you. - Have you started the rehearsals yet? - We have. Yes, actually we've just opened our songs and sketches workshop. - What are they shooting? - The Newsreel. Ah. Listen, Jeremi... I was wondering if you might be able to talk. Good afternoon, Mr Jeremi! Oh. And what's she here for? She's performing. But she isn't the new Autumn Girl, is she? Sorry. My hands are tied. No worry. It's really not your fault. I'm sure you did your best, my dearest poet. Rysiek! You're a piece of shit. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. And that's ten. Hello, there. How'd it go? Hi, there. Ah. Kalina! How'd it go? It went fine. Eight over nine. Bravo. So what did Jeremi say? Are you back on television? I told you not to talk about it in front of Staś. Jesus! Why are you afraid of him? I'm not afraid. Why would I be? Don't get angry with me. I'm just asking you how it went. It went badly. - Why? Because you were late? - Oh, spare me the lecture. - But you're always late... - Fine! I was late. I'm always late. What is your problem? Kalinka, you have to do something. No, I don't have to do anything. I'm gonna call Jeremi. I already saw him. And? Well, tell me how it went? No. I think it's probably time you went home. What for?

One might say, "Warsaw is on fire." Excuse me. But please stay calm. There are no burning buildings in the capital. That's Kalina Jędrusik. But the streets are certainly ablaze with neon lights. And it's not just the locals who abode by their beauty. It's the visitors from overseas too. The relative flashing and whirling letters truly are a sight to behold. Our capital is beautiful not only during the day but also at night. Would you like a caramel? Mum gave us a whole bag. They're yummy. The number of silver screen enthusiasts is constantly growing. And now the nation is buying television sets en masse, and who can blame them? The Distinguished Gentlemen's Cabaret is currently in rehearsal. Their program is a closely guarded secret.

Why don't you write something about men for a change, huh? You understand? Now, go and apologise. Apologise to Henio, you bully. Don't you fucking dare touch him! You mind your own business. You're not even his mother. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Now, you go and apologise to him. You take your fucking hands off him! Do you hear me? Oh. He should apologise to my son. - Did you do anything wrong? - No, not me. Then we're done here. It wasn't my fault. Come on, Henio. Time to go. This woman should be in the madhouse. Come on. Did you see the look on his mum's face? What was all that about? It's 'cause Heniek was saying that planes aren't able to land on water. But they can, can't they? That's right. And you did brilliantly. Let's go. It's freezing. Can I fix my makeup here? Sure, come in. What's wrong? Everyone's out there dancing and you're having a bath. I don't want to dance. That bad? I just don't know what I did wrong. Nothing's wrong with you. He is the crazy one. He's been firing people left, right, and centre. Even Nina. Who's Nina? His secretary. The skinny one. What for? What for? Don't think about him. Don't give him the satisfaction. Come on, let's dance. I'll just finish my cigarette. You know, I love it when you're like that. - Like what? - You know, dangerous. Cheers! Ah! Good morning, Ms Kalina. You can't go in! Entry to the building is for employees only! Now please leave! Oh, so that's how it is, is it? Well, now you're in trouble. Xymena, come with me. Kalina? What are you doing here? I'm gonna settling things with Molski. Come with me. - Why? - Come on, I need you. Don't even think about it, sister. - Kalina, stop it. - That nun is following me. That's Jadźka Zawadzka. She's an actress. You're right. You see? See what that bastard's done to me? I'm sorry. I thought you were another nun. I'm going in. What are you going to do? Give him a piece of my mind. Sounds good. What do I do then? Nothing. Nothing? Then what am I here for? I just need to know that you're here. - So I just stand here? - Yeah. - That's it? - That's it. Got the wrong number! Right. Why did you fire her? Nina. What did she ever do to you? You can't be in here. Get out. What is wrong with you, Rysiek? Are you going to destroy every girl who turns you down? - She isn't "every girl". - Oh. So you're in love. Fuck, you can't even fall in love like a normal person. There's no comparison between you and her. - Oh? - Yeah. Why is that? You're provocative. And you are vulgar. Of course. She's modest and innocent. Isn't it funny? How the same thing still happens to us both. It's actually quite a feat to have such nerve. Yeah. I'll see you soon then whether you like it or not. The best of luck. - Oh! Ms Jędrusik! - Sorry... I came to tell comrade Molski about you. You've won. The Wieczornego Express conducted a survey. It's a great success! Huge! You've won the Golden Mask! It's not official yet, but I got a call from the editor-in-chief. And one minute the people were angry with you, now they love you. So, Ms Kalinka? Can you forgive us? I'll think about it. If there's anything we can do. Well, I do have... some conditions. Comrade Molski will take care of everything. I'll start with a pay rise. It's been quite chilly recently and my coat's a little old. I'd like to buy a fur. Go and draw up the contract, will you... Molski? - Hello. - Hello. Anything smaller? I don't have any change. Everyone calm down and wait their turn. - Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. - Oh, no, you don't! Well, you might be happy to wait in line all day, but I'm not. - It's Kalina Jędrusik. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, if you're so important what are you doing in a shop like this? Buying bread? I don't think so. Of course not. I'm buying champagne. Drinking Champagne in the middle of the day! I'm not drinking it. I'm bathing it. There. A 134 zlotys. - You can keep the change. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye! - Bye! Mm-hmm. I'll have to stop you there, Tadzio. Kalina's just come home and she's bought two bottles of champagne. No, I can't see any caviar. But she does look rather pleased with herself. Oh! You hear that, Tadzio? Tadzio says to tell you that I'm a monster. But he understands you, because he loves me too. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, Tadzio.
