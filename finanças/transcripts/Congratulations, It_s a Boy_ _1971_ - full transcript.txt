[MUSIC PLAYING] -I think every divorced guy in this town must live in this building. -Uh-huh. Well, I'm not divorced. -How did you avoid that? -Oh, that was easy. I never got married. -Never thought about it? -Eh, I thought about it, yes. -Mm-hm. -But I just haven't found the right girl. Yet. -Or have I? It's a key tree. Would you care for a drink? -Let's wait 'til later. -Oh, 'til later, yeah. -[DOOR BUZZER] -Wow. -Uh, are you Mr. John Gaines? -What? -Are you Mr. John Gaines? -Yes, I'm Mr. John Gaines. What do you want? -I have to see you. -You have to see me. Uh, just take me a second. What? -Are you Mr. John Gaines? -Yes. -Mr. Gaines, I think you're my father. -What did you say? -I said I think you're my father. -I think you've been smoking something. -Boy. They are really out tonight, I'll tell you. I got a nut out here says he thinks I'm his father. Oh, boy. His father. I could be his father like I could be your father. -You're old enough to be my father. -I'm old enough to be your father? Why don't you go out and join him. I'm only 37 years old. -So? My father's only 36. -How old are you? -16. -16? 16? Why are you dressed like this? Why do you dress like this? -Trying to look 17. -Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't. Here's your purse and here's your shawl. -What's the matter? -Nothing. I just don't want to spend the summer in San Quentin, that's all. I'd be delighted to drive you home. -Well, if that's the way you feel about it, I'll walk. -Swell. Oh, it's you. I'd like you to meet you. You two should be very happy. -Is something wrong with him? -I hope not. I think he's my father. -Well, I guess he's no worse than mine. [DOOR BUZZER] -It's 3 o'clock in the morning. Go away. -Yeah, but I came 600 miles to see you. -Go 600 miles back. -Can't you give-- can't you give me just a minute? -You have one minute. -I don't know where to start. -You're wasting precious seconds. -Look. Don't you recognize me? I'm your son. -Time's up. -Wait a minute. You're my father. -Shh. I'm nobody's father. -You are my father. -I'm nobody's father. Now, will you please leave? -That's a very nice picture. Looks like me. Junior army uniform. -I was not in the army. I was in the AMA. -What? -Arizona Military Academy. I had to go there because of my asthma. That girl looks familiar. -That's my mother. -Mother? She's a very pretty lady. Your mother. Is this a joke? -No. -What's your name? -John Gaines, Jr. Call me B.J. I had nothing to do this weekend, so I thought I'd come out and see the Pacific Ocean and look you up. You're not really interested, are you? -No, I just need time to think. That's all. This is incredible. This is incredible. That's the only word I can think of right now. -Yeah. Well, I won't waste any more of your time. -Where are you gonna go? -What does that mean? -I mean, where are you going to stay tonight? Do you have a place to stay tonight? -No. I haven't found one yet. -You wanna stay here? Tonight? -OK. -Uh, hungry? -Yeah, a little. This is like a miracle. -What is? -You not being dead and all. -Dead? -Well, Mom had always told me that your plane crashed in Korea. -Huh? Aunt Florence. You remember Aunt Florence, Mom's sister? Well, she said that wasn't true. So I decided I'd come out and see for myself. Did it or didn't it? -Did it or didn't it what? -Your plane. Crash in Korea. -No. -It didn't crash? -No. -But you were a war hero. -No. -Well, anyway. You were in Korea. -No. I told you. I had asthma. -Good morning. (LOUDER) Good morning! -Oh! Good morning! Why are you all dressed up? -It's Sunday. -Well. This is Los Angeles. We're very informal here. Oh, I know we get dressed up on special occasions, like weddings, funerals, things like that. But just to knock around on a Sunday, I think blue jeans will be just fine. -What about church? -Well, I guess the people that go to church get dressed up. -Don't you go to church? -No. -Never? -No-oo. -Why not? -I just don't. [PHONE RINGING] -Don't get me wrong, though. If you want to get up early on a Sunday morning, get all dressed up and go inside a church when the sun is outside, you should do it. Hello? Hi, mother. Look, just hang on a second, will you please? Yeah, well wait. Wait one moment. Yes, uh, all right, mother. What was it? Uh-huh. I feel fine. I do, I feel fine, mother. Edye? Edye didn't say a word to me. Well thank you, mother. But I'm perfectly capable of making my own breakfast plans. Mother. Oh, mother. May I call you back in a few minutes? I have something important I have to do. Yeah. All right. Yes. Yes, mother. All right. Yes, mother. Good-bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well, here you are, sir. -Sure you don't want to come in with me? -No. Some other time maybe. But not-- -Hi, Johnny. What are you doing up so early? -Um. Hi, Janie. Janie. Girl I know. Uh, which reminds me. Listen. If we run into any more people today, why don't I just introduce you as, um, B.J. Van Ness. B.J. Van Ness, an out of town buyer. -S'matter with my real name? -Nothing. It's just that, um, well, big cities are like small towns. They're even worse, you know. And people are liable to talk. You know. -Yeah. But if you came to Arizona, a lot of people would know that you are my father. -Well. Uh, how long do you think you'll be in there? -About an hour. -Good. Good. Well, enjoy the matinee. [KNOCK AT DOOR] -Who is it? Who's there? Johnny! Morning. What are you doing here so early? -I was in your neighborhood. -Why didn't you call and let me pull myself together? -Oh, cut it out. Now have I ever complained about the way you look in the morning? -No. -Never have, no. Edye? -Hmm? Edye, I um, I have a little favor that I would like to ask of you. I would really appreciate it if you didn't ask me to explain, all right? -All right. -All right. Edye. -What? I would like you to call my mother. Yeah. Yeah. And explain to her please that we will not be able to join them for breakfast today. -Oh. Why not? -Edye. I asked you not to make me explain. Please? -Is there anything I can do? -No. No, nothing. -Well, anything, I'll do it. -No, no. Everything is under control. And by sundown tonight, it'll be gone. Well, you may not have seen the Pacific Ocean, but I would say that it's the end of an almost perfect day. -Yeah, that's right. a perfect day. -Hungry? -A little. -OK. I'll tell you what. Why don't we go by my apartment and we'll pack up your things. And then we can go to a great restaurant and have dinner before we go to the bus depot. -Why do we have to go to the bus depot? -Why? (LAUGHS) Well, certainly you have to go back to school, to your family I mean-- -What family? -What do you mean, what family? Your mother. I know she must miss you. -My mother's dead. The very last Wednesday. The only other family I had was Aunt Florence. -What about her? -She's a nun. I might as well stay here with you. -Hi, Ben. This is Johnny. Listen, may I talk to you this morning? Yes, it's very important. As a matter of fact, it's a matter of life and death. No. Seriously. I mean life and death. I think I have a real problem on my hands this time. Yeah. Well, since you're coming in to the meeting at 10, would you mind coming in at 9 so we can talk? Oh, that's great. Oh, fine. I appreciate it. OK, I'll see you soon. Bye-bye. Good morning. Sleep well? -Yeah, fine. Hey, want me to fix breakfast this morning? -No, no. You go ahead and fix breakfast for yourself. But don't leave here. And wait until I call you. I have to go to work and keep the wolves away from our door. -Father, what do you do? -What do I do about what? -Are you a deep sea diver, lawyer, test pilot, demolitions expert? -I sell dresses. -Johnny? Who's there? -Who's there? Johnny, is that you? -No. I'm not Johnny. I'm a friend of Johnny's. My name's B.J. -Hi. I'm Rhonda. -Hi. -I didn't know anybody would be home. I just came by to pick up my interview dress. I'm reading for a cat food commercial this afternoon. -That's very interesting. -Uh, look. I'm a little pressed for time. And I don't want to put you out. Is it OK if I come in for there with you for a few minutes? -Come in here? -Yes. -No. You can't do that. -Why not? -Why? Because there's no more hot water. -Sure don't sound like a friend of Johnny's. After all, I wasn't going to hurt you. You're sure not very friendly. -Oh. Um. Well, we've only just met. We're like total strangers. -I just love kitty tum yums. -What? -I just love kitty tum yums. That's the voice I'm going to be using. I'm supposed to be a cat. -Oh. That's-- that's very interesting. Do You live here? -Nope. -You just come here to pick up your clothes and take showers. -Yep. -Hmm. She's either very tall or very un-chic. -Hi, Johnny. -Hey! You mad at me or something? -Oh no. I'm sorry. Good morning, Herman. I've got something on my mind. -Cares of the world, huh? -Hi. -Hi. Is Beigelman here? -No, but he's in the building. How are you? -A little frantic. That's how I am. -I felt so good seeing you yesterday. [LAUGHS] -Sweetheart, come on. Not with the door open, and not in the office. [BUZZER] Answer that, would you please? -Yes? Yes, yes he is. OK. The boss wants to see you. -How 'bout that? I haven't been in the building but two minutes. He's in? -He's in. -You wanted to see me? -Yeah. I hope you didn't forget about tonight. -Tonight? What about tonight? -Dinner at the club! -I forgot. -You're supposed to ask Edye to go with you. -Dad, I told you I forgot. -It's all right. I asked her for you. -You asked her for me? Dad, I am a big boy now. I can make my own dates, thank you. As a matter of fact, I happen to already have a date for tonight. -So cancel it. It's not a terrible tragedy. -I haven't got time to argue. -I pay for your time. So don't tell me when you have time. -And I work very hard for that pay, and you know it. -I know you work very hard, and why shouldn't you? This whole thing will be yours some day. After all, I don't plan to live forever. -Hi, lover. -Hello, Mom. -Mother. -Mother. -Are you and Edye having dinner with us at the club tonight? -He sure is. -Oh good! After all you missed breakfast with us yesterday. -Yes. -Lovely tie. -Thank you. -Hello? -Let me see your suit. -Yeah, yeah. -Oh, it's divine. -OK. -Love it. -Ben Beigelman is waiting in your office. Is something wrong? -Why should something be wrong? -Why are you dealing directly with the company lawyer? -It's just something that's wrong with my car, Dad-- -What do you mean wrong with you car, dear? It's no life for a boy running around like that. You have to do something, Al. -What do you want me to do? -Well, for one thing, I want you to do everything you can to keep those two together. She's the perfect girl for him. She comes from a nice family. She's not too independent or too smart. I'm telling you, if one of those sharp cookies gets a hold of him, I will never forgive you, Al. -Ethel, what more can I do? Johnny needs a secretary like I needed a pants presser. You asked me to put her on, I put her on. She gets $144 a week plus fringe benefits. She can't type, she can't take shorthand. -Well, why should she have to type or take shorthand? She'll be left a bundle when Herb dies. -Please. Don't rush him. He's a year younger than I am. -Well. I Am so worried that Johnny will meet the wrong kind of girl, especially since he's not living at home anymore. It was that raise you gave him. -You told me to give him a raise. You said, give him enough money so he won't quit but not enough to get him in trouble. Ethel, you're driving me crazy. What do you want from the boy? -I want him to be happily married. Just like you, Al. Well, is that so terrible? -Ben, I uh-- I don't know where to start. -So how about starting with once upon a time? -Oh, come on, Ben. I mean it. I-- I don't know if this began last Saturday or last Saturday 18 years ago. -Look, Johnny. Why don't you just sit down and tell me all about it. -All right. Well. Once upon a time -Yoo-hoo. Is he in there? -Yes. -How are you, honey? Is he paying any more attention to you? -Well, I-- -You know, I was thinking, just between us girls, maybe a padded bra wouldn't hurt. You know, something with-- (LAUGHS) And if you like, I'll get you the afternoon off. And I'll take you to Carlo's and he'll do your hair just like mine. Johnny would love that. -I-- I appreciate it. But I don't think it's necessary, Mrs. Gaines. -Mrs. Gaines? You call me Ethel. Please God one day it'll be mother, -Get me the registrar at the Hall of Records in-- -Coteville. Arizona. -Coteville, Arizona. --OPERATOR: Yes,sir. -Go ahead, Johnny. -All right. So anyhow, I horse him around town. You know, show him the city. And then, Ben, he tells me he is going to stay here. Now legally, what are my responsibilities? -Let's check the records first. But I'm not thinking legally right now. I'm thinking about what people will say. -Please don't. -I'm thinking about two people in particular. Your father and your mother. Now, Al, I'm sure once he adjusts to the idea, well he might like it. But Ethel, she thinks she's a young woman, Johnny. And she thinks you're her little boy. Now what would happen if suddenly-- -No. No, don't finish, Ben. Just tell me what do I do. -First thing you do is relax. [BUZZER] -OPERATOR: Mr. Beigelman Coteville, Arizona on line number three. -Hello, sir. I wonder if I might get you to check the birth registration file for me. Yes. 1953, 54. Mother, Lois Kelly. It was a son. Right. I'll hold on. If worse comes to worst, you'll live. After all, you're not the first man in the world to become a father. -What kind of an answer is that, Ben? I mean, what kind of an answer is that? Most people that become fathers, at least they get married first. They wait nine months to have a baby, Ben. And then it's about that size somewhere in there. And it grows and it grows. And it-- and it grows. And you change all those diapers, Ben. And when it finally gets somewhere in this area, you take it to the pony park, and you take it to the little league games, and you buy it a Boy Scout uniform. And then after all that time, Ben, after all those adjustments, then you get someone the size of B.J. -Yes, yes. I'm still waiting. -You know, that's not gonna help. -All expectant fathers do it. -Uh, yes? Yes that's right, Lois Kelly. So what's the name of the father on the certificate? Thank you. Thank you very much. -Well? -Congratulations. You've just had a baby boy. -Have I? -The father's name on the certificate is John Gaines. -Thank you. Ben [MUSIC PLAYING] -Johnny. Johnny, is something the matter? Are you sick? -No. I'm fine. -Is there anything I can do? -Yes. Order me a box of cigars. I've been driving by this place, I imagine most of my life. And if you hadn't yelled, I'd probably still be driving by this place most of my life. -Well, when you asked me if I was hungry, I suddenly realized I hadn't had good Mexican food in about three days. -Good Mexican food. -Like it? -Well, um. It's all right. But you know, it just-- well it sort of all tastes the same to me. -Really? -Yeah. You put cream in your chili? -Yeah. It's how my mother used to make it. -What was she like? -What do you mean? -Well, I mean, uh, was she nice? -What kind of a question was that? -She has to have been a redhead, right? I mean, she has to have been. -You don't even remember her, do you? -No, not very well. -How long did you know her? -A week. Maybe two weeks. -You weren't married, were you? -No. -You sure? -Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. -Very well. I guess we know what that makes me. -Oh, well. This is today, you know. No one thinks about that anymore. No one cares. -You didn't know about me, did you? What would you have done if you'd known? -I don't know. You really put cream in your chili? -Yeah. You want some? -No. No, no. My mother never did that to me. -Your mother. Is your mother still-- -Oh, yes. Is she ever. -How about your dad? -Oh he-- both of them, both of them just going so strong. -Grandparents. Wow. When do I get to meet them? -Uh-- -That'd be a problem. -Yes that-- well yes, that would definitely be a problem, particularly at this time. But um, speaking of problems, I'll tell you. I have one and you really could sort of help me with it, if you don't mind. I mean it's nothing difficult, you know. It's very simple. You see, I-- I managed to get myself in the position of having two dates tonight. So if you could just sort of help me by taking one off my hands, just for a little while. -What's her name? -Edye. -Isn't she a little older than me? -Uh, yeah. You know, but I can tell her that you're 25 years old. And she'll never know the difference. -Well, uh, didn't Edye expect to spend the evening with you? -Yeah, but it doesn't really matter, you know. It's OK. -You dated her before? -Yeah. -And you don't mind me taking your girl out? -Hey. What are fathers for? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on. -Are you sure this is gonna be all right? -It's going to be just fine. I told you, she's an employee. She's my secretary . And the only reason she got the job is because her parents met my parents a year ago on a Caribbean cruise. -What if she doesn't like me? -She will like you. Will you relax? This always makes her mad. -Come on in. -Do you open your door to just anybody? -No. Just anybody doesn't put his finger over the peephole. -Mhm. See I told you so. All right, come on in. Well. Edye, B.J. B.J., Edye. -Hi. -All right now. -I'm not much on drinking. -Oh just-- just a small one, you know, to get your motor started. Why don't you two just sit down and get acquainted? -Uh, hi, B.J. -Hi. -Nice to know you. -Nice to know you. -OK. We're acquainted now. Would you please tell me what's going on? -Nothing. Nothing. -Where are you from, B.J.? -Arizona. -Been in town long? -No. No, not long at all. -Planning on staying? -Uh, yeah. This is my home now. -Ah! Well! Come on, how about a nice quiet little drink? Hmm? I mean after all we could all-- we could all talk later. -No, Wait a minute. Are we all going to be together later? -Well, first a quiet drink. All right? Now I would like to propose a toast, so I shall propose a toast. Uh, here's to-- -Here's to a nice quiet drink. -Yes. I'll drink to that. That's good. That's a good one. How do you like it? -Not much. -Not much? Oh, well it just takes a while for the taste buds to adjust, that's all. You see, after the first. Well, the second martini just sort of slides down. Well? -Fine. -Uh-huh. Yes. Well, I suppose it does take a little time to adjust to martinis, right Edye? -Right, right. Look. shouldn't we be leaving? -Oh yes. There has been a small change in plans. Just a small change. Now, Edye. I already had a date for tonight. Now, that was before dad called and told me that all the families intended to get together and all that. So I thought the best of all possible worlds would be for me to, uh, go with him to the club, and then when we're through doing our dues, I'll come back with you, leave you with B.J. And you can spend some time together. And while I take my date-- you see, I couldn't reach her on the phone. So I'd at least take her home. And then I'll come back, and I'll pick up B.J. B.J.? B.J.? You all right? -Oh, I never felt better. -Good. Good. All right. I'll tell you what. I will be back in three and a half minutes, so don't anybody run away. OK. -Hi, Edye. Things are moving a little fast. [CRYING] Something the matter? Edye? Open up. Edye, would you open the door? I think I'm going to be sick. -Oh, all right. just give me a second. Can you hear me? You OK? Wait. Let me get you over here to the couch, and I'll get you some coffee. -Oh, no, no. No coffee. -Yes, yes, yes. Be right back. Now take it easy. You'll be all right in a few minutes. Look. One thing you should never do, and that is to take a drink on an empty stomach. OK? -Is it true about you and him? -Is what true? -You know. -He told you that? -Told me an awful lot. -I don't believe it. -Do you love him? -Look. Why don't we talk about you for a change? -OK. -How old are you? -I am 25. Just turned 24. -I'd say 19. -Mhm. Not quite 18. -What did he have on his mind? Why-- I mean how did he find you? -Oh. He didn't find me. I found him. He's my father. -What? -He's my father. Only he didn't know about me. If I hadn't come out here to look him up, [DOORBELL] -Good evening. -Good evening. -Good evening. Hey, some pad. Molto groovy. -Ha. Uh, that's Rhonda. Rhonda, this is Edye. -Greetings, Edye. -And that's B.J., on the couch over there. -Hello, again. -Hello again? -Oh, I met B.J. this afternoon when I stopped by your apartment to pick up my dress. -Oh. I-- I had a sample of 22C over at my place. Look, Edye. I think it would be best if we took your car for the two of us, and I'll give my car to B.J. And-- -I don't think B.J. Is going to be in any shape to do anything tonight. Besides, I want to have a little talk with you. -Talk? -Look, will you two make yourselves at home? We're going for a little walk. Look, Johnny. I can't tell you what to do. You're a grown man. This is between you and him. What does he want? -What does he want? He wants to live with me. Live with me! Now what are my parents gonna say? -Oh, what difference does it make? -What difference does it make? You know how they're going to feel about being late at that stupid dinner tonight, so how are they gonna feel-- -The stupid dinner happens to be because my mother and father came down from San Francisco, and your mother-- your mother made a decision that we should get the whole family together. -The whole family. well what do they expect of us? I mean the whole thing is so ridiculous. -All right. Don't worry about it. I'll explain it to them. That'll be my job. You go back in there and pick up B.J. And that's your job. And I'll call them at the club. -Yeah, but Edye you-- you won't say anything. -No. No of course not. That'll be for you to do. -Edi, you're a nice lady. -Yes, I am. -I'm hungry. Where are they? -Oh, they probably just stopped off for a little lovemaking. -Ethel, what are you saying? -You're such a stick in the mud. I had a little talk with Edye this afternoon. I told her some things a boy like Johnny would like to hear. -Ethel! -Al, these things just don't happen by themselves. Have to be managed. -Telephone, Mr. Gaines. -Hello? Oh, hello, Edye. Where are you? We're starving here. -Is she all right? -If she's with Johnny, she's all right. -Oh, I see. No, it's OK. No, it's all right. It's all right. -Well? -We'll order now. -Well? -Well, Johnny had something else to do. And Edye didn't want to come over alone. -That's all? -That's all. If I didn't know Edye any better, I'd think she was crying. -Oh, nonsense. They're together. They probably just stopped somewhere for a little lovemaking. -Ethel. They both been together in the office for the past six months right under my nose. Believe me, there's no lovemaking going on. -So he's still young. What's the hurry? -Al, it's not like we've known each other for 30 years. A year ago I wouldn't have known you from Adam. But I just feel that-- never mind. -What do you mean, never mind? -Nothing, nothing. -What do you mean, nothing, Nothing. There's something on your mind. -Well, not every guy wants to settle down and get married these days, that's all. -Not every guy wants to settle down and get married. Big deal. -But I think there was something else. Go on. Tell him, Herb. -Well, yes, Herb. Go ahead, tell him. -Yeah, tell me. -Well, there's some guys that just don't like girls, you know. -[LAUGHTER] -You think Johnny doesn't like girls? -I'm not talking about Johnny necessarily. And I'm not talking about anybody in particular. But there are a lot of guys around, well like Rose's cousin. -Leroy, the interior decorator in Sausalito. -Well, what's that got to do this? -He's got a very nice business. He makes 50 or 60 a year. -The women just love what he can do to a room. -He's as happy as a clam. He lives in this big Victorian house in Half Moon Bay. -Well, It's 11 o'clock. Tell me. Have you see enough of the Pacific Ocean now? -Yes, I did. -Good. Fine. Now what would you like to do? -I uh-- I'd like to talk. -About what? -About us. About our future. -Look, B.J. Everything is going to be OK. Do you believe that? It's just going to take a little time, that's all. Just a little time. -I don't care if it takes forever. We belong together. Don't you see that? -Oh, come on, B.J. Of course I see that. I understand that. -But? -Look. Look, are you hungry? -No. Look. If you're worried about losing your job, you can come work with me. -Come work with you doing what? -Running the gas station. -Gas station? -Yeah. It's just a two-pumper. It's closed now, but I own it free and clear. -A gas station? -Yeah. I suppose it's half yours now, too. Look out, Dad. -Now, wait a minute. Now wait a minute. Now wait a minute. What do you mean it's half mine? -Because. You're my father. The gas station. Well, Grandpa died. And Aunt Florence was already in a convent. So he left it to Mom. -Hmm. Must have been tough for her. I mean it's hard enough for a man, but for a woman, you know. But I guess your mother was big, strong for a woman. -You don't even remember what she looked like, huh? -Yes, I remember. Um, it's just that people change. You know. As time and a half goes by. -She remembered you. talked about you all the time. -She told you about me? -A lot. She-- she wasn't ashamed. Neither was I. You know, when Something like that happens it can be beautiful that's what mom said. -I don't know what to say. -She didn't blame you or anything. It's the truth, I wouldn't lie about a thing like that. She was blonde with light green eyes, 5 feet 4, and weighed 109 pounds, if you'd care to know. -Hm-mm. I won't forget after this. OK. OK. Let's get out of here. I'm going to introduce you to some people that I can't possibly describe to you. -Who's that? -Your grandparents. (WHISTLES) Come on. -What kind of a boy is it goes around 37 years never married? Interior decorators, that's what kind. And hairdressers. [PHONE RINGING] -I'll get it. Hello? It's Johnny. -Johnny? I'm coming dear. What's the matter, Sweetheart? Oh. Wait a minute. He's got someone he wants us to meet. What time is it? -It's 11:15. -Couldn't it wait, Sweetheart? It's after eleven. Uh-huh.
