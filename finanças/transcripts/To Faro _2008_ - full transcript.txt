- Take your break. Mr. Da Silva... - Nuno. Nuno needs a locker and overalls. And meet me at my office later, OK? This way. This one's empty. Nuno. Is it Spanish? Portuguese. And where... where are you from? From Faro. Can I have one? Cigarette. These are good. From Portugal. I sell them. Wait. 30 euros for the carton. What do you think? Here, go ahead. Have a good one, right? My Friend From Faro Hot-and-sour vegetables today. The socket is burnt out. Too old. No sugar. Hey, do we have a matching fourth plate? Why four? Vicky's coming tomorrow. Oh, Dad... Shouldn't I... No, no. On... off. Damn power companies. Do we have sugar somewhere? Yeah. Here. Dad always scares off the cleaners. The last one was cheating on me. How about chopped almonds? No. High time Vicky moved in. What? I've been meaning to tell you. She's not moving in. We're getting married. Why? We're expecting a baby. What about this? That was years ago. And it's not like anything will change. Nothing will change when Vicky moves in? - You could really be my brother. - But I'm not. But you could be, as long as you stay dressed. Why don't you try a little harder? I'm sure you'd find someone. Maybe I already have a boyfriend. Oh, yeah? Then you can bring him tomorrow. Why should I? Cos otherwise I won't believe you. - I want one, too. - Last one. - Share. - I have to pee. Come on! Jenny, stop it! Oh, fuck! Did you fake your ID? - That's so obvious! - Who cares? Won't show it anyway. Do I look like I'm 14? Shit. I want to dance, drink, snog... Not be stuck here. I'm going to stand in the road. Jenny, it's fucking dark! Jenny! Oh, my God. Give us a lift? I don't get it. Are you OK? We want to go to the Sputnikhalle. I go past there. Well, then. Cool! Sounds like a sports car. Where are you driving to? - Shouldn't we go to the hospital? - Wasn't so bad. Really. Just supposed to look dramatic. She wants to be an actress. "Mama Faro"? I'm not getting a word of this. Wasn't important. Was that Spanish? No, Portuguese. - Are you from Portugal? - Yes. From Faro. Stop! Better practise your braking skills. Going to spend the evening in the car? - Jerk. - He normally lets us in. Malte could open the back door. - Is he working today? - At the bar. You have to do us a favour. - You almost ran me over. - After everything I did? What am I supposed to do? The shitface got my princess. Hi. Are you Malte? Who wants to know? Supposed to give you this. We're in! A drink to that! Sorry. Have to drive. Just one. What's your name, anyway? Lets guess! Ricardo. Rico. Pablo. Ernesto. Manuel. Miguel. My name is Miguel. I'm Jenny. Bianca. And how old are you? Eighteen. - I'm 16. - Me, too. To Miguel. To Miguel. Hey! Looking for me? Have you seen Bianca? Normally you stick together like glue. - She just went off. - So I have you all to myself. I'm going to look for her. Maybe she's ill. Hi. You're so lucky. Look at this. Gonna take forever again. Still in there? Take your shit at home! Had to make up my mind. Right, that's what we'll do now! Come on, guys. Still here! Want me to leave? No. Like it here? Yes. What about you? It's totally cool today. Bianca's vanished. Help me find her? Sure. I want to go. Can I give you a ride? Bernd. There'll be trouble. - Who's Bernd? - Bianca's big brother. Man, that's like... I don't get it. That's my sister, you pervert. She's still underage. Hey, Jenny's underage, too. Bianca! Jenny, I can't go home like this. What about her? Let her sleep. Where could they be going? To Portugal. I have to tell you something. Me too. Bernd isn't just Bianca's brother. He's also my boyfriend. That's cool. Really. I just want to... sit here, next to you. Couldn't do this with Bernd. He probably has other qualities. He talks a lot... about himself, his ideas. If the ideas are good. Aren't. Then why is he your... Dunno. Do you see the same stars in Portugal? What is it? Jenny? Where are you? Ciao, Miguel. - Thanks for the lift home. - My pleasure. Jenny? You forgot this. What are you doing in there? Did you get into trouble? I was on the road. And then I... nearly hit someone. You had an accident? What happened? Nothing. We were at a disco and it was beautiful. Just... You really met someone? What's his name? Come on, talk to me. He's... from Portugal. And what's his name? Miguel. Why don't you bring him tonight? Are you bringing him? Mama Faro called. Your mother? She sounded pretty pissed off. Are you a real Portuguese? Why? Are there fake ones around? Born in Faro? Yes. Why is your German that good? Because I went to a German school. But your family speaks Portuguese, right? Yes, dude. Say something. OK, what do you want? I want to make a deal. I'll pay you 20 euros per hour. OK, what do I have to do? Tonight you act... as my boyfriend. Your boyfriend. You're not kidding? No. All right. I'll do it for 40. Thirty. Thirty-five. And what's my name? Miguel? And I'm a real Portuguese? - Yes. - All right. Hi, Melanie. Mel. Looking good. Should we go outside? Your dad's waiting. What about your boyfriend? Kind of late. Southerners aren't as punctual as us northerners. Miguel's coming. He promised. This one's for you. Dad. I don't eat meat. Make an exception today. No. - It's well done. - No! Where's your boyfriend, anyway? Not here yet. I seem to be in the right place. I rang the bell, but I guess no one heard. Or it's broken. Hey. Don't you want to introduce me? This is Miguel. My dad, Willi. My brother Knut. And that's Vicky. His girlfriend. - Beer? - Sure. Cosy place. The decor's not my fault. I did it. Yep. But it's pretty! Makes me feel all romantic. Did you know each other before Mel ran you over? She didn't run me over. I'd look different if she had, right? Well, kind of almost hit him. He ran in front of my car. - Yes. - Hitchhiking. At night. - So nothing happened to you. - Oh, sure. Mel happened to me. Could have been worse, right? Yes, we complement one another perfectly, right? Yes. Listen, sweetheart, did you hit me on purpose? Wouldn't surprise me from Mel. Everyone, let's eat. Otherwise it'll go cold. And nobody wants that. - No, nobody wants that. - No, nobody wants that! - Salad? - Yes, thank you. Dad. Really? Unbelievable. - No. - Really, no kidding! But how did you end up here in the sticks? - Really want to know? - Yes. OK. Seems to be an interesting guy, that Miguel of yours. Didn't think you had it in you. Maybe you'll make some offspring, too. Want to dance? Any preferences? Fast? Slow? Really slow? You know what I want to hear. Knut and I want to go to the Dummer next week. Want to come? Swimming, picnic... it's really nice. Sure, sounds good. Do you know the Dummer? No. But maybe we'd like to. No time. Have to work. Another time, then. May I? Come on. Stop sulking. Don't forget, we're in love! You think I'll see Miguel again? Jenny, sleep. He's totally handsome. You have Bernd. He's handsome, too. But I can talk to Miguel, he listens. You can talk to me, too. Something's off about Miguel, I think he's weird. He's just different from Bernd. He didn't even kiss me. Maybe he's gay. He's Portuguese. Maybe they're slower. Can you do it in Portugal before you're married? You should really do it. Then you wouldn't always talk about it. And you? Miss Touch-me-Not. I'm waiting for Mr. Right. Go ahead and wait. Hey, are you OK? You scared us. You passed out. The excitement. I'm not well. I want to go to bed. Knut, Miguel wants to leave. I'll see him to the front. - Come back sometime. - Sure, I'd like to. - Bye. - Bye. So, what do you think? Know what I think? I think I should be an actor! How much for seducing Vicky? Listen, I'm not a hooker, OK? You're nuts. Really, I don't get you. Ciao, Miguel. Miguel told me you want to go to Portugal together. See how it all works out. Well... I've got a good feeling about this. No time for acting today, sorry. Wait. Know a Portuguese poet? Who writes about love? No. How much? 20. Daily special. And? Fernando Pessoa. A lot to learn from this guy for you. Miguel. What do we do now? Would you like to go for a drink? Thank you for the nice evening. How may I help you? How long are you staying this time? An hour or two? You're seeing your cop in Berlin again, right? Jenny, lets just enjoy being together for a second. Hello? No, it's a good time to call. Yes, when? I'm not busy. Sure. Where do I ring? Good. Adeusinho, ate breve. Bye, see you. No, can't do it. Bibi's sick. You could come a little later, right? You can tell me about it later, right? No. No, it's not going that well actually. You can tell me about it later! OK. Catch you later. Hello. Bom dia. You look different by daylight. Different? How? Cuter. Nicer. Blow some smoke at me! What kind of music do you like? Me? Don't care. I normally don't listen to music at home. I like it quiet, too. What does the letter say? I'm getting it! No, wait! Surprise! The spaceship scenes are ready! Hi, Jenny. I thought Bibi was sick. She is! Off to bed! What's that freak doing here? That's the guy from the Sputnikhalle. Oh, the toilet philosopher! What's he doing here? I left my wallet in his car. My address is in it, so he came by. Is he hitting on my girlfriend? What's up, can't he talk? Dude, no smoking in here, get it? I wrote you a great scene! I was on my way, anyway. I'm happy and sad because I'm losing what I dream And I can be in reality where she's what I dream. I don't know what to do with my sensations. I don't know... I want her to say something to me so I can wake up again. Whoever loves is different from who they are They are the same person without anyone. That'll give you a headache. I've got one already. I guess your date wasn't a hit, then. What date? Seemed to me like there was some competition. Don't worry, you're the one and only. Let me take you home, OK? Move it. See? That's bad shit, man. Having it both ways now? Shit. The fairy can't make up his mind. Have we met before or am I missing something? - Nah, but we've met. - Let's get out of here. Nasty, dude. Shame on you! Shame! Who were those cretins? Cool, man. - Was one of them your date? - None of your business. None of my business, right. That's my photo. It fell out of your pocket. Sorry. Know what? It's a present. Thanks. How are you getting home? Walking. Can I give you the balance tomorrow? Don't worry, it was for free. See you. See you. - Hey. - Hey. You can stay over, you know. Right? Another time maybe. Bye. Are you OK? Yes. Listen, are you on the pill? I don't want you regretting something later. You're telling me? That's awkward. What's Jenny supposed to think? Hi. Sorry about yesterday. Never mind. Jenny! Are you free this afternoon? Nature trail? At three? See you there. Bibi, do you know where Jenny is? Come on. Impact! We took a hit! Quick, the porthole. Calling spaceship two, we're hit, object approaching. We should ask the oracle. Cut. You forgot the fog again, Malte. Start again. Why didn't you come? You're getting on my nerves. We're shooting. Get lost! I waited two hours. I thought we'd be done. What is this? Sod off, now! Whatever. Just keep going. Are you just gonna let him go? You were really going to meet that Portuguese fag? We'll start again. Miguel, Bernd had a deadline for a competition. I promised to help. He said two hours. OK, I should have known better. I wasn't thinking. - Are you throwing a party? - Nope. All for me. That's what you do when you have a heartache. Saw it in a film. Jenny, I wouldn't dump Bernd for someone like me. But I do. I want you. Well, well, well. How cute. That's why... Now I see. - Miguel, who's that? - Miguel? Ah, Miguel. Who am I, huh? I'm sorry? Another Portuguese? Did you know him? That was my brother. He's not doing great. That was obvious. Jenny! You were supposed to get something to drink. What the... Come on, let's drive somewhere. Shit! My keys are gone. Pity. Lets hide over there. Wait. Lie down like when I hit you. Hello? Jenny? What's going on? Is that your car? Yes. That's Miguel. My friend from Faro. My mother. Evening. So, you're from Faro? Do you go to school? No, I work. - What do you do? - Mum! I'm just curious. Do you know what time it is? How was I supposed to know you'd be home? Don't be cheeky, Jenny. I'll call you. - Goodbye. - Ciao, Miguel. I didn't hear your car. I lent it to Miguel. That has to be love. Your car is sacrosanct. Dad? With Miguel... Is he treating you badly? - I'm in love. - I know. The first time. I know. You don't know anything! Have you eaten, Dad? Delicious. Really delicious. I didn't cook it. Delicious anyway. Dad, it's ready-made junk. Open it. For me? You could use something like that now, right? He'd like it. Your present. Good night, Dad. Which one of us is Miguel? Miguel's better than the two of us combined. And so what? He doesn't exist. - It just turned out that way. - Just turned out that way. Miguel is going to get both of us in trouble if you don't do something fast. What am I supposed to say? Hey, Jenny, sorry, I'm not from Portugal, I'm not even a guy? Needs some polishing, but basically, yes. Hi, Jenny. Where are you? Norddeich harbour? I could meet you there. Yeah, sure. When? See you tomorrow. Adeus. Miguel, hmm? Miguel! No one saw me. I'm in trouble because of you. Are you coming to the beach with me anyway? Fifteen minutes. Como esta? Muito bem. Obrigado. Obrigada. You're a girl. Will you teach me Portuguese? What do you want to know? What do you say for sea? I like to swim. I'm going to the mar now. I'd really like to go to Portugal with you. Let's go and never come back. And your mother? Doesn't need me. What about your sister? Bibi's happier without me. And Bianca? Bianca wants everything to stay the same. That's impossible. It's boring. I would really love to go to Portugal with you. You have to kiss me. Take off your wet clothes. What time is it? Almost five. Shit. My mum's gonna freak out. At last! Where have you been? We've been waiting for an hour. I was so worried! - Didn't you get in trouble? - Sure. Maybe it was an orgasm. Tell me, what was it like? Wonderful? Prickling all over. Like a wave collapsing over you. It was totally great. - Stay a while. - I have to go. But I've prepared everything. I know you did, but... Stay for a little while. I have to go. I have to talk to Jenny. Alone. I just want to know... Did you sleep with Miguel? No! I'm driving, it's my scooter. - I fixed it. - No, your weird sister did. My sister's not weird. - She certainly is. - No, she isn't. The guy scares me, Jenny. I know nothing about his family, his job, where he lives... So what? Is that important? I want to go to sleep. Listen, my wolf, I need your help. Could you find an address for me? License plate ST-G 655. A woman came by today. Karla Schmidt. Your Miguel molested her 14-year-old daughter. In your car! Fourteen? I knew something was off about him! He's not your type anyway. He's a sleazebag. I want his address! What? No, I'll talk to Miguel. There's probably an explanation. Sure. She was probably just imagining it all, right? She's 14, OK? She lends him the car, then she doesn't want to give me his address. Yes, but she's all shaken up now. Of course she is, she's been hanging out with that dirtbag. Jenny. Hello... It was the most beautiful thing I've ever... But, Jenny, we have to stop. No, I have to leave for Portugal. No, it's wrong, Jenny. I'm wrong. No. I don't love you. He says he doesn't love me. Good riddance. Miguel dumped her. Is everything OK? No, nothing is OK! Is it because of that Portuguese guy? The paedo? Miss Wandel, why are you fiddling with that? Sorry, I'm kind of low today. I'm sorry too, but you're always kind of low. Miguel? Hello? There is no Miguel. Miguel! Jenny? I don't know what's going on, but either you go back to your work now or you are fired. I quit. And leave my girlfriend alone. Let's go. Why do you say you don't love me? That hurts! I know. I'm sorry. I don't care if you work in a factory. Am I too young? Miguel! I loved being at the beach with you. Jenny, I'm not who you think I am. I don't care what you've done. I don't want to know. Jenny, your Miguel is not a real Miguel. I... I... I don't know. There is no Miguel. I am not Miguel. I love you. I'm different. I'm different, too. Jenny? Let me in. It's me. What are you doing? Calma. What did you expect? That she jumps and cheers? Rapariga, que estas a fazer? Come on. What happened? Swear you won't tell anyone? Miguel is not from Portugal. So he's from Spain? He's not even a boy. He's a girl. Did he say so? Did you see it? I don't get it. Am I a lesbian now? No. You didn't know that he... I mean that she's... Oh, sweetie. What were you thinking, Miguel? What's going on? - You come here, you dare to... - That's not Miguel. ...show up here. - It's me, I'm Miguel. What? Jenny thinks I'm from Portugal. Miguel. She believed it till today. And him? He's a colleague from work. I paid him to act the part of my boyfriend. Why? Where did he go now? Who? Miguel. There's no Miguel, Dad. What do you want? You lied. To tell more lies? OK. Three at the nature trail. - What's up? - You shouldn't tell Bianca anything. What did she tell you? Nothing. But I know anyway. I don't even know your name. Mel. Melanie. Are you really 18? Twenty-two. Sure? Sure. Why did you say you're from Portugal? It was you. You asked if I was. You could have said no. You wanted me to be Portuguese and I liked it. You're the most beautiful person I've ever met. I fell in love with a boy. - What are you doing here? - We're worried. You swore. - I couldn't. I'm your friend. - Carpet muncher. What's this supposed to mean? You went too far. You wanted to mess with me. Hey, who's messing with who? Better watch your friend. I think the fake Portuguese wants a lesson. Your Malte is worse! He's fucking Bianca because he's bored. Shut it, hear me? - I'll take care of this. - I love Jenny. Stay there! Leave him alone! Her. It's a her. And she had it coming. Stop. Who shat in your brain anyway? Let's undress her. Look, there's something under there. The trousers! Fuck. My eye. Hey, come on. She's getting off. - Fuck. - Damn it. I'm sorry. You should get home. And you? What happens now? I'm leaving. For Portugal. Faro. Write to me? I'll never forget you. Carpet muncher You'll miss me. Melanie. Take care, Dad.
