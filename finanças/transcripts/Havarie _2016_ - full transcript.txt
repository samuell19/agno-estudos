General average I'm at the window. I watch my father. He's standing there with these people. They're terrorists. He's talking to them. But I understand nothing. I'm just watching. They're standing beside the car. They're asking my father to get into the car. I'm scared they will take him with them. They get into the car. Ironically, it was I who gave them the car keys. Because they were in my room. If they take my father, I want to go with him. The problem is: There are two men. They're at my door. I can't go out. I was 12 years old. Hello, greetings. How are you, Soumia? You okay? Thank God. Is Abdallah there? Can I speak to him? Thanks. Hey, where are you? Didn't I say that you should wait for me? Oh, good. Thank God. What did you do today? Whom did you meet? Karim, aunty Zoulika, Fafa? Good. Tell me. That's good. It's okay. Are all well? That's good. I got a letter from the authorities, where I was recently. I've lodged an appeal now. And I'll go to Nantes. We're waiting now. I phoned the lawyer, but she's still on holiday. All well otherwise? Don't you dare tell me about the beach and such. Because when I speak of it... Who? Fatima? What's with her? Oh God... But where? She said you thought of me as you drove off. I said: A pity. God willing, next year. Will you meet them? Good. Good, okay. See you later. I may be out then. I'm bored, everyone's gone. I have no where to go. I'll ring you when I'm online. Okay? Okay. See you later. Bye. Yes, tell me? A boat with refugees was sighted. Alright... Hello! How desolate! Everyone's gone. If I leave, I can never return. Because I don't have legal papers. Yes, exactly. I was able to travel to Algeria and return. I had a job and an apartment. Then I applied for an extension of my resident permit. They rejected my application. Because I got married in Algeria. Yes, to Abdallah! It means: I'm supposed to go back. Destiny - I don't know... It's all blocked. I'd like to stay here. The question is not whether I like France or not. But my doctor's here. I'm being treated here. That's the reason. It's like this: When I came to France, the doctor who examined me said: Your scoliosis is antiquated! It doesn't exist in France. Because here it's treated at birth. I've lost so much time. I tried here and there. Went to Algiers, to Oran, everywhere. But when the doctors saw me, they said: Nothing can be done. If you can afford it, go to France. When I was young, my father couldn't afford to send me to France. Then I applied for a visa numerous times. When I was 12, 13, 14 years old. All rejected. We tried again and again. Until I turned 28. I applied for a visa, and fortunately it was granted. At the moment, I have to visit my surgeon for the aftercare. An appointment every six months. At present, that's what I think about mostly. Afterwards - I don't know... It was her smile, with which it all started. I met her at a market in Paris. That's how I met her. We then got to know each other. I looked at her. She returned my gaze and laughed. Although I was deported, we stayed in touch. I fell in love with her. I wish to share my life with her. God sent her to me. It's my destiny. When I think of it, I'm sad. At times we phone or skype. It's the only way we can talk. In God's name... This is Cartagena Maritime Rescue Center. Houcin, how are you? - Are you better? Yes, thank God. - Are you working at present? It's okay. The usual. I was at the beach just now. Do you remember the full moon night, as we were about to leave? The sea was so calm. When I'm on the beach, I think of the day on which the waves were so high. - The first or the second time? The second time was a breeze. The first time was the great adventure. We suffered for 3 days. It was really hard. I lost my gear. We liked best the early morning start. Starting out at 4am. In the moonlight. A pleasure. - The coffee in the morning. The day began. But it was a risk. - Yes. No easy feat. I loved the dolphins! The sea was calm, the dolphins played with us. The killer whale. - Yes. And the turtle. What fun! Then the sea got rough... And there... Once on the other side, I couldn't believe it. I thought I was going to die. Sometimes I can hardly believe I'm still alive. Then I think: God is great. That's life, my friend. And if I tell you: One more trip, and then that's it? - No. I think we'll do a final trip, then it's over! No, never. Hello. How are you, my darling? Are you alright? Have you recovered a bit? I was out, as usual, at the market early today. At the bird market. I earned a little, then returned home. Yes. And you? Any news? Nothing? Yes, I know. Yes. Maybe there'll be news next week. About my application. Regarding my visa application. Yes. With God's help, we'll have some news. Maybe he'll bring us together. God willing. Yes, okay. Take care, my darling. That's most important. I'll phone again this evening. Okay. I love you more than anything. Thanks. Abdallah! - Yes, I'm coming! If his wife weren't ill, he wouldn't go. She's ill, what can she do! - If only she could be here. His poor wife is ill. On the day of the attack. That's when I submitted my application. I was out of there at twelve thirty. I drove to a friend, to Chopeau in Oran. When I arrived, he said: You have rotten luck. You apply for a visa, and there's an attack. Yes, at Charlie... He applied on that very day. Well, what luck. It's not so bad. Every cloud has a silver lining. William Wallace! William Wallace is a brave man. He loves freedom. He doesn't want anyone to dominate him. He was ready to die for Scotland's freedom. That's why I'm called William Wallace. People know I'm brave. Isn't the beach beautiful? An entire people set off from here. Another 75 kilometres, and you're in Spain. The sea there is keeping me from my wife. But if I die at sea? What will become of my wife? Who'll take care of her? Do you think people died because the sea swallowed them up? They were rammed by ships! There are ships that deliberately ram them. I've experienced an airplane trying to kill us. It flew so low above us, to kill us! That's how it flew, I'm telling you! It flew above us, turned around and came back. With it's wind, it tried to capsize us, in the middle of the ocean! Many people have died in this sea. Many of whom are said to have disappeared. I had one with me, who's in England now, Mohammed. In the middle of the sea, he said: Stop here! He saw houses, buildings, hotels. He said: Stop here at the hotels! He had hallucinations, the sea is dangerous. In the Quran, God says that ghosts live in deserted places. Like in the Sahara or in the sea. They haunt the sea. You sense things. You see nothing, but you sense it. William Wallace! Willam Wallace is sailing the high seas! Only that counts! Our motto is Harraga! Harraga is our motto! Here brother, look around so you believe it! We weren't created to stay on shore. There are no mountains, nothing! It is only us and our God, the sky and the water. That's our gear. The sea lies ahead of you. Spain lies ahead of you. Misery lies behind you. Open your doors, Spain! How wonderful life would be in Barcelona! And Algeria stays behind. Oh men of the neighbourhood, come and see how unhappy Abdallah is! Give us the visa! That's all we wish for. Oh Barcelona! Oh men of the neighbourhood, come and see how unhappy Abdallah is! Give us the visa! That's all we wish for. I'm zooming in. See how many containers it has! They've seen us. Let's get out of here! Oh, they're Harraga! Algerian, no? Maybe they're only peaceful fishermen. Port Oran calling Smaragd... Port Oran calling Smaragd... Yeah, good afternoon. Destination Barcelona. Estimated arrival time: 01:00 tomorrow. Yes I have dangerous goods on board classes 3, 8 and 9. Total quantity: 63.5 metric tons. Thank you, good watch. This vessel had experienced five stowaways from Algiers. And they found them only in Valencia. Our vessel is potentially in danger because all Algerians know that we always go to Spain. Thanks. Our course is now north-east. According to the forecast, stormy weather awaits us in Barcelona. Fallen trees. Same tomorrow. Yes? I don't know, I saw it on television. Rough seas are expected. At wind force 7, we won't be allowed to enter the port. Finished, Sir? Yes, okay. Thank you. Hello Luda! How are you, darling? How are the kids? Any news? How are you all? Is the situation calm in Odessa? Imagine, it's not even safe in the streets. What's Andrej up to? Did he send off his application? Alright... Wish him good luck from me! And what's Oleg doing just now? Everything alright? There's no snow anymore? There's no peace, not even in the east. What's the situation like at the university? Oh, it was the holidays? It'll sort itself out. The main thing is that you stay healthy. That the kids are doing well. Yes, and that there's peace finally. Good, I'm glad to hear from you, my love. That's how it is. Take care, my love. Me too. It'll soon be half a year. Me too. Give the kids a kiss. To the little one and the older one. Good, my love, see you soon! Me too, yes... Lifeboat Mimosa? Cartagena Maritime Rescue Center here. Two hours from now. Two hours. A bit earlier would be better! Yes, it's a permanent state of waiting. Here on the ship, one waits for home. And on shore, one waits for work. If one is at home for too long, there's a vacuum, and something's missing in life. Sure I know that, but it concerns not just me, but my father as well. He spent 40 years at sea. It's 31 years for me now. I told Valentin the position of second mechanic will be vacant from May. Evgenij got a job there. End January, begining February, right? I don't know. - I think so, he is there. Considering the situation... I don't know whether he served in the army but that was one reason... They said, those who were in the army before would be drafted first. My son is 17, he can be drafted into the army now. It's rather worrying in this complicated situation. There's no guarantee as to where he'll end up. We were all born in the Soviet Union. And time separated us from one another. We're living in different countries now. Igor, for example, is from Archangelsk. The captain is from Odessa. And Oleg from Crimea. - Yes, from Crimea, I'm from Sevastopol. And the crew here is international. The Filipinos also have their political views. That's why I am no supporter of... ...political discussions? ...political discussions about what happened in the Ukraine. Between the Ukraine and Russia or between Donbass and the Ukraine. I could shout some slogans but that would be pointless. Everyone can do it at home. Yeah, at home, whenever one wants. Walking around with different flags and so on... Enough of that now. He's had enough. Each one has his own opinion. Most Filipinos like this song. It's very famous. Prodigal son. For me, it symbolizes myself because sometimes I'm a prodigal. Yes, that's why I like it. Because I can relate to that song. Lost souls. They say, some spirits are roaming around in the wilderness... I heard these people from Libya going to Italy. They died of hypothermia. But I don't know... Maybe their spirit is still roaming around. Let's sing again. Play it again! Rescue helicoper Helimer? Cartagena Maritime Rescue Centre here. Yes, Cartagena to Helimer, channel 10. We're on our way to the location. We estimate 42 minutes. Understood, arrival at location in 41 minutes. I repeat the position of the passenger ship and the dinghy: 37 degrees, 28 minutes north. 0 degrees, 3 minutes east. Helimer 211 calling Cartagena. Yes proceed, Helimer 211! ...inform you that we'll arrive at the location in about 40 minutes. I'll calculate it more precisely, but about 40 minutes to get there. Alright, the idea is that you stay there. The lifeboat Mimosa has given us their arrival time. They still need about an hour and a half from now. Jackie! Look how many are on it, Jackie? Tell me how many are on it. - How many are on it? Jackie, love, just look at all the heads. Ten or something like it... They called the Spanish coast guard? - Yes. Is that a wee speedboat, Terry? Is that an engine on the back? Yeah, a wee speedboat type of thing. You'd always wait. It's a waiting game. I mean, a good night is when nothing happens. You know, you don't want necessarily... It'll depend on the circumstances, but generally... within security, a good night is when... you've had a peaceful night. There hasn't been any cause for concern. You're always on the edge. You're waiting on the unforeseen. Sometimes when you least expect it, that's when it can happen. So you always have to be on the lookout. Sometimes you can be distracted by certain images or whatever and they're not an important security image. And you can't get distracted. And that's when you'll miss something else. You need to be on your toes. You need to be on your guard. No. No sound. All visual. It's reality TV. You'll not get any more real than this at times. No breaks. Constant. Yeah, I see that there. I mean, as the night progresses... It'll go quieter. There'll always be something going on in the background somewhere but generally a lot quieter. And then it resurrects itself in the new day. You see the light coming up again, the sun rise in the distance. The animals, birds coming awake. Belfast on a Sunday is a lot quieter than the normal. These streets used to echo to the sounds of military vehicles. I was standing just here, just around this area here. I could see, my family home was in view here. I was aware my own father was standing at the door. I could see what was going on in view. So, at that point there... there was British Army and they were moving down this street. You have dogs barking, you have... a lot of sounds and stuff going on. And then there was the sound of... a plastic bullet being fired. I could see the figure of this young lad fall to the ground. I was aware that it was young Brian Stewart who was actually being hit. People screaming, there were a lot of girls and women screaming. The soldiers, confusion going on. They tried to arrest him, what appeared to be trailing him by the feet. Then they let him down. They let go of him and they proceeded to leave the street, pursued by angry residents at the time. He had called at my door prior to him being shot. I was around another part of the estate, just around here. Unknown to young Brian, he came around here and had actually rapped our family home looking for me, which I found out later. My mother had answered the door and said to him "No, Terry's not in." So he left and I think it was literally moments later, he was being shot at that corner. If I'd have been in, he might have been brought into the house. But there you go. How are you? The helplessness that there was... There was anger. There was venting of anger. I remember feeling that. There was a lot of venting of anger. Buried on his fourteenth. I just wonder about people now passing by his mural, how many give it much thought. That's a very, very good likeness of him. He's looking straight here, isn't he? He's looking straight down. Good morning. - Good morning. How was your night? Good. You want some toast? - Oh no, just a cup of tea'll do me. Are you for a workaday, Jackie? - Yeah. You'll be heading shortly? - Yep. It was some rain last night! I must go and feed my wee birds. Terry, I'm gonna have to go to work. - Alright, love. See you later. - See you later. Time for bed. We were at home in the evening. Suddenly we heard something. Women screaming. They dragged them through the street to the mountain, to kill them. We went outside to have a look. But it was hard to see. We had to hide and tried to see something. They dragged them until they refused to go any further. One pulled out a weapon. He shot them without hesitation. Two died on the spot, one didn't. Until morning. In the morning, she tried to stand up and walk. We wanted to help her, but we couldn't. She crawled to my grandparent's house. She scraped at the door and cried out: "Help me!" We heard her, all in the neighbourhood could hear her. Until morning. At around 7 am, we went out to cover her up. We covered her up with a white sheet. We cowered all in one room. Out of fear. Those who were born in the 90s weren't brought up with such things. They cannot understand. Most of my friends, who are now in their mid-30s, who experienced terrorism still live with the stress. That's why I say: Those who escape to Europe - you need not fear them anymore. You should fear those who live in Europe because they're easily influenced. I like the sound of the waves crashing. I suppose it gives you, it's peace, a sense of peace. And this is what life should be. Watched them for quite a considerable length of time. 90 minutes in total? Yeah easy. They were a distance away from the ship. You sort of tried to zoom in to get a clear understanding of what you were actually physically looking at. And then you realized, my God there's, human beings in this. You start to try and imagine why they're there. What's driven them to there. To a certain extent, you start to try and put yourself in their position. But you can never replicate that. You can only assume that it has been something that has been drastic enough to drive people to do that sort of thing. They were waving and people were waving back to them. It was a strange, strange sight. This image awakens memories... I was at sea for 3 days, exactly like this. The sea looked different. Not so harmless like a swimming pool. Here the sea is calm. We had bad weather when we had the breakdown. It was raining as we set off again. When it rains, the sea turns calm. Because the rain drives away the wind. When I look at it... Not an easy situation... The one in the blue jacket, he's in prison. In Spain. This is the one, who sang about me. He's forever singing for the Koubba football team. The one there is from Constantine. The one in the front is unwell. On account of him, I said: Either we stay or... If we'd stayed, he would've died. The poor man is diabetic. I gave him dates, sweets and cake. The one there is in France. This one is also in France, beside him is Houcin. The one in the yellow jacket. The poor chap here is also in prison in Spain. I feel sorry for the two of them. One is an orphan, the other is impoverished. Do you know... Do you know when we saw the Spanish mountains? Around 1:30, 2pm. When I saw the mountains, I wanted to stop. To turn off the engine. I noticed that he'd falled asleep, the diabetic. I said: Listen friends, you have the choice. We have to take this man ashore. If he dies, it'll be our fault. He wants to go to Europe. His parents need him and are waiting. Either we go ashore now, they'll arrest and imprison us. Or we wait until it gets dark and he dies. They said: Abdallah, you decide. I said: I want to take him ashore, maybe they'll arrest us, but he won't die. How wonderful life would be in Barcelona...
