Charlie, which one? Give me five of the best dog food. This one, okay. Let me help you. Thank you so much, you are so kind. It's nothing compared to you. Always buying food for strayed dogs. Morning Charlie. Wow, you are growing up so quickly. Morning Charlie. The usual? Rice dumplings with tea, I'll pick them up. It's ready okay... how much? Let... me pay. It's alright... Come on... No, no. It's my treat, it's alright! No, no. Take it, take it. Hello puppy, don't you have a home? Why don't you come home with me? Dodo, dodo. Dodo, dodo. Have you seen my puppy? Puppy? Nah. What does your puppy look like? Brown, he's very small and answers to Dodo. Oh... Oh... Oh... Is this what your dog sounds like, oh... Yes. Then I've heard it. It went way over there, go look for it. Okay, thank you Charlie, why are you bandaging its feet? This way it looks more helpless people will be more sympathetic which means they'll donate more money. Remember, it's 1 to 99 1 part real dog food to 99 parts mud and dirt. Alright, got it. So the dogs will have diarrhoea. Then their owners will have to buy medicines from us. Why don't you just shout? Tell the newspaper to come and interview me. If I do snitch... I'd tell them about your fake spasm and charity scam. That dog... I'm sorry, sorry I'm kidding I don't think anyone could have thought to set up a dog shelter, fake spasm to gain sympathy I really do look up to you, Charlie. My life depends on you. You'll always be my master. Don't leave me behind. Just work hard. It's time, the Ladies Charity Group should be arriving - okay... - Let's get ready okay, work hard. Excuse me. You can't smoke on public transports. What you called this a cigarette. These e-cig is all the craze right now. Sir, you are also taking up two seats. And what's it to you? I've bought two tickets of course I get two seats. Paying twice doesn't mean you get two seats. Who do you think you are? Are you a cop, why don't you call backup? Slow down. Shoot from here, do it properly. Get my profile shot, upload to Facebook for likes. It's easy when you look as good as me. Everyone here is a witness I'll call the cops when we're ashore. Fine. Why don't you guys tell him who I am? Village Chief. Do the smart thing, squat down put your hands over your head or you can swim with the fishes all the way back ashore. What a useless pussy. Fruit Tart. Keep it clean. Yes, village chief. Chief, can we have the ball back. What is this, crying with real tears? Give him twenty. Stop crying. Why are you staring at me with such contempt? Give him another twenty. Say I'm David Beckham. You're David Beckham. Give him another. Say I'm good looking I need forty to say that. That is brave, you'll go far. Give everyone forty. Come here and say it together. Me too. Together. The chief is good looking. Take a look, doesn't he look like a mop? When I first saw him I thought... he was a mop bitten by mice. Then I looked closer. He was a dog. And my conscience was calling me. Save him, if you don't, he will die. So I saved him. Now he's a very cute dog called Dodo. He's beautiful. He's so cute. Very cute. Look at how cute he is but the funds are running low here. It's a shame I'm disabled if not I can work even harder to help even more animals giving a home to every strayed dog. No need to clap that helps nothing just donate money. Donate... I've got cash, let me... Charlie, all three of them are so rich. You can retire if you get together with anyone of them. This is more difficult than you think. If you want to be a kept man you can't be too picky or choosey but just think what if they ask you for a French kiss what would you do? I'll do it I'll work very hard to be a kept man Charlie, please send two bags of dog food to my home. Here's your chance see how hard can you work okay. Hey, what if it's me who do the delivery? You? I want two bags, too. You want two? I want three. Three? The later the better I'll take a bath and wait. No, no I'll cook something up for you. You're so bad. Let's see what else are inside. You've got something to eat okay... take your pick the more the merrier. Dodo. Humanity is overrated Charlie. Gigi. Wow, you are absolutely stunning today I look stunning everyday. You must be turning many heads being so sparkly I have to visit my family in Canada for a few months. So please take care of Udon for me okay, no problem I'll treat her as my own child, she's a good girl Charlie, here's a little something for Udon's food and stay. Do you have to insist? Just take it. Alright, thank you. So where are you going with your husband? I've divorced him I caught him cheating with a boy toy I have to give him half of everything. The judge is an ass. But as a single lady, you can go wherever you want be with whoever you want. I can bring some dog food over drink a little wine, play with the dog, tonight? Alright, but it's a shame you are like this. If not, you do seem rather nice. People like me can be better so easily. Maybe a typhoon, a storm thunder and lightning, striking down on me will make me better. Let's talk about that some other time I still have to pack, I better get going. If a miracle does happen when I get back then we can give it a shot. Alright, we'll give it a shot if miracle happens okay, I have to go. Have a safe flight. Bye-bye Charlie, Bye-bye Udon. Have fun I'll treat her like my own daughter. Dog trainer Bill. We have a Samoyed. It's a girl, still a virgin. How's 4000 dollars for the whole night? Morn. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Looks like she needs another hour let's try those 3D glasses. That's so 3D. Don't get too close. I'm coming. Step mothers are born evil. How long have you been here? That's not the point. Seeing how you were enjoying yourself I didn't want to get in the way but you kept using my lotion which cost me thousands of dollars. Take it back, okay. But then it got me thinking you shouldn't just play with yourself I mean it's good you don't need a date, it's simpler. It's good to practice, but it's better to have a partner. Why don't you find yourself a wife? Then you can do it for real. How do I find the time to meet her I'm developing a career, working on important things. I know. Since you became the village chief you've been binge watching American dramas learning to be bad. The world has changed. Bad guys are now the lead while the good guys suck. Sucks or not I just want someone to take care of you. Hey, I've set you up with a wonderful girl today. Really? Of course. Bing. The barramundi are really fresh today I've brought you two for sashimi. Who does sashimi with barramundis you trying to kill us? Are you crazy? No woman is ever good enough for you. What kind of woman are you looking for? The sorts I see in American dramas. Someone who is pretty can conspire with me. No woman like that exists. Of course there is. How did you hurt your leg? Does it hurt? What's your name? His name is Dodo. This breed of dog is very self conscious. If his leg doesn't heal properly then he shouldn't be placed with other dogs because he will feel humiliated. I know how he feels, being disable myself. Hello, my name is Charlie. What's yours? Call me Jane. Can you tell me where can I find this address? Just carry on down that way. You dress so properly, what do you do? Office? Oh, air stewardess. Lots of them live around here. No, I'm a novelist. I write too, sometimes screenplays. Have you seen “One Nite in LAN Kwai Fong”? No. I haven't either, just shows our taste is the same. Come on, Udon. Look at that. We even have doggie pron Charlie is so demented. Maybe I can come around some time. It's okay, I live on my own, it will be awkward. Why would that be awkward, you've got a boyfriend? Husband? No man in your life? It's late, I better get going and stop bothering you, bye. It's alright, I open the dog shelter here. Thank you. Do you need to rent a dog to guard your home? What's up Charlie? Who's she? Sugar mama. How do you know? Look at her bag. It costs over 100K. Wow! You should go for it! Hey, have the dogs finished? Not yet. Then why are you out here? I'll go back to work. Hey beautiful, what do you want? I want some pears, are they sweet? Of course, let me help you. Fruit Tart. Are you trying to sell rotten fruits to tourist? Of course not, Chief. No! Then what's this? - You. - Go fix this. When you buy fruits it's important to try them first. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. Hey, your Chief is chatting up a girl. Just look at him I've never seen you around, you just moved in? I live nearby, you are the Chief? Yes, I'm the Chief of the village I'm Bing. I'm Jane. Kumquats are good, let's buy some. What a slut. It's my treat enjoy. So many? You're welcome. Binging! Bingbing! Bingbing! That girl is calling for you. Ignore her, she's crazy, she does this everyday. What else do you need, I can come with you I need a fish. Oh, I can't go there I suddenly want to have hotpot I have to go now, see you. Thank you, Chief. They're very fresh. Excuse me. Yes. How much is the white one in the middle? It's not for sale, it's for my dinner. How about the black one by your feet? - 200. - 200? Doesn't that say 50? 50 is for villagers 200 is for sluts like you. You think it's too much? Then just leave! Alright, I'll go. Coward. Got too excited needs to take a dump. Excuse me... Look which way the wind is blowing I'm sorry, sorry. It's bursting. Coming out. It's Ying! Let's go! Look, hot chick. Why is she sneaking around, let's take a peek. Someone's in here! How dare you bully me. Hey! What's happening? Who is this? Hey! Open the door, stop messing around! Who's the slut? Revenge while the enemy is taking a dump. That is so badass. My queen! I bet it's diarrhoea, this is payback. Who's the wanker? - Who is it? - Ying is full of shit, let's go. "YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN FROZEN" I'm sorry. Miss Yu, because yours is a supplementary credit card and have signed over... the authorization of your personal accounts. The main card holder has frozen all your assets you have no access to your account or credit cards. Your card is out of money, just get off. Can I pay in cash? Take a look the cash box is locked up. My boss thinks I've been stealing from him so you can only use the card. But I always take this route I'll pay you back next time. Why don't you take me out on a date next time and you get off now! Please help me out this once? I'm telling you to get off! Oh my... the teardrops are so big. You can win the Oscars! Chief. Hey, Man, it's you. You don't have to shout at the ladies. Everyone talks like this in our village. Don't put me down to your level I'll pay double for her ride apologize to her. It's not how many times you pay. Three more times, apologize. Don't you see, us men... What card is this how could you keep paying? Let me tell you. This is the limited edition black Centapus card. Centapus released it under the radar on my birthday. Luckily I've bought it not only do I get a 1% discount. There is also a special function where I can pay as many times as I want until I stop tabbing. Chief, please stop you win I'll get fired if the machine breaks. Miss, I'm sorry you should have told me you're his friend. Thank you, Chief. Just call me Bing. Looks like you have some money trouble take it. I admire you so much we might seems like strangers now but after getting to know each other I can guarantee I couldn't get rid of you even if I try. Thank you, Bing. Let's have dinner once my money comes through. No, my treat let me cook something up for you. Oh, have you been to Disneyland? Yeah. Really? What about Ocean Park? Been there too. Really? I think you two should get a room now I'm cool with that, what about you? I want to go home. Alright, go home! Then it's a date I have to go home to change... for a very important meeting. In 1972, the Cross Harbour Tunnel opened. In 1979, the underground began service. And in 1999 the Airport Express was going to and from the airport. What are you saying, Chief? I'm saying I have planned for this village to have optic fiber ultra speed internet! Wouldn't the whole village get radiation? Yeah. I like the slow internet speed here. Since not every villagers own a smartphone we're proud that we don't have phubbers people are more connected with each other I hate those contracts that tie you down for 2 years. And no one ever answers the cancellation hotlines. I understand your worries... but just think with ultra fast internet all your wives can download... Korean TV dramas much quicker so they have less time to care about you. And when it's match day in EPL we can have gatherings. Watching the games together. Our bond will be even tighter. As to your contract worries... don't worry I have managed to negotiate 12 months contract and rebates on the 3rd, 6th and 9th month with EPL souvenirs for everyone. If there are no further objections I've already made a deal with the provider they will start laying the cables right away. It'll go from the front to the back of the village and will definitely affect your lives. Wouldn't that mean cutting down the Wishing Tree? That's even better. With the tree down, we'll have much more parking space. Yeah, I have to park so far away it takes me 20 minutes to walk into the village I might as well take a taxi I'm sorry, I still have to object. The Wishing Tree is a symbol of our village I feel responsible to uphold this spirit. What are you thinking? My wish is hanging up there. You're so selfish. What wish is it? Lynn and I have split up for so long I just wish we could get back together. Back together. How about 600 dollars for your wish. But I really love her... 800. She's not only the person I love but we are also best friends 1000 dollars, that's all I'm willing to pay. It's not a bad price. How can money pay for love? 800 If Lynn... Lynn finds out how can I look her in the eyes? - 500 - I thought you are going down by 200 why did you just jumped down by 300100 I thought we agreed on 1000! But then you can't be back together. To be honest Lynn cheated on me I don't even know why I want her back I can get an escort for 1000. As I said everything has a price. If the price is right there's nothing money can't buy. Well said, well said! Heaven and earth moves... so Puppy will live on. FiFi's Dog Amy. No, I'm Amy my dog is Fifi. She's called Amy her Dog GiGi... been a bad dog. Getting hit by a truck... on a highway. That girl is so pretty. Break open the gate of hell. Go to heaven Fifi. Nice one. Done your dog GiGi is in hell. No, I mean she is out of hell, it's done. My condolences. These papier-maché dog, cock and house has to go home with you for 49days. Don't worry. GiGi will become a dolphin in the next life. Then you two can be a couple the one after that. Make sure she pays in full. - Okay. - Thank you, Charlie. Don't be too upset. It's all itemised, my calculator is that way. Don't move Charlie. Get behind me. Be careful. Hold on tight, we use our force to defeat it. Tighter, you are not holding tight enough, okay? Tighter still! Okay... I need to go home. Wait my morn taught me after fighting off a snake you need to stand still for 3 minutes so the snake won't come back. Charlie... Charlie. You're awake. Am I okay? Easy, the poison has been sucked out. Sucked out? No wonder I'm all relaxed thank you. It's a shame I fainted and didn't feel a thing because I still feel a little poison in me. Please, suck it clean for me. Wait. Hey, there is still a little poison left. Give me a 5 minute cigarette break I'll come back to suck it clean, alright? Don't move! Charlie, I'm sorry. It's my fault that you were bitten by a snake. Let me buy you dinner. Cool, why don't I bring something along. My farmer's salad is the best. Chief Charlie. You are all dressed up, got a date? Look at you with all the buttons done up. You must be going on a date, where are you at? I think I want it, she wants it both of us want it. Me too, this is the best time. Trying to guess each other out. Trying to guess how the other person feels Charlie you know your Mexican liquor. Half Glass Smashed. Easy on taste bud, goes straight to the head. Friendly after one glass. Giddy after two. Frisky after three... and seal the deal after four. Looks like it's a night of sins. Night of sins is good, hope it happens. More the sins, more the fun. Hey, have fun tonight. Let's share our match report later I will need at least until tomorrow. Can't meet you tonight I'm going this way. What? This way? This way. I'm this way too. What? You two know each other? Yeah. That's great, come in. Alright. Be careful. Why have you two brought so many things? I made this salad specially for you. Every leaf was picked from the tree so it's fresh. It looks really good, thank you. And the liquor. Look how fresh my fish is I personally caught it from the tank this morning I'll fillet the fish then fry it. HALF GLASS SMASHED The fish is so fresh, how do you want it cook? I can pan fry it, deep fry it, or roast it. Isn't it better to steam fresh fish? Tomato, tomato it's more romantic to cook for two, European style. How would I know a third wheel will be here. Miss Jane asked me to dinner I didn't know some ass like you would be here I just thought more the merrier, right? He's here now, what can I do. How about I teach you how to fry fish fillets. Come on, come... Miss Jane Charlie. Miss Jane Charlie, are you alright? - You need water? - It's okay, I just want to ask, which of these did you write? None of them I haven't published anything yet. Oh, you are so pretty. Lots of people will help you when you're ready. Looks like you love reading Yi Shu I'm a fan of hers. Me too, I especially love "The Story of Rose". What a coincidence, blah blah blah. Let you have a fish fillet a la armpit. I remember the film they made with Maggie Cheung playing Rose. It was shocking wearing that tiny tank top without a bra. Roller-skating, bouncing around. Yeah, Rose bouncing around bra... This is yours. Thank you. A special one for you. Didn't you said you can cook? Fried fish fillets need herbs. Where're the herbs? Herbs? I forgot, I'll get them now, right now. Miss Jane, can you pass me his plate ls there a problem? Of course, he is a problem in himself. So there is definitely a problem with my plate. If you can think of it, then so could he, right? Then, why don't I swap with you. Would you do that to me? Of course not, I care too much. Hey, why aren't you eating? It's too hot, start without me. Fish needs to be eaten when hot, if not it will get fishy. You start. What are you doing? I'm praying, bon appetite I'll wait for you. It's alright, it'll take some time, I insist I'm going nowhere, I can wait I'm praying, please be quiet, just start! Shut it let's drink, house rule, 3 shots first. Then let's get Miss Jane drunk I mean, thank for inviting us to dinner. Are we not friends, start drinking. One is friendly. I thought it meant to be easy on the taste bud. But it does go straight to the head, feeling dizzy... My second glass. Two is giddy. I'm so happy. So happy... The third. Frisky. So... frisky. I feel so hot. How are you so normal after three? Look so elegant yet arrogant. You guys drank liquor I just drank tea. That is very strong. Of course Rose I'll shower first, wait for me. Mom, there's soup in the kitchen heat it up yourself I'm going to masturbate. I promise you once only. Mom is the best without mom a kid is just a bum... True or false. How do I be myself Charlie. Yes, yes... Bing, Bing. Chief. Chief. Miss Jane. Jane... Hey, Jane. Janey... Jane. Janey. Hey, asshole, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? I was about to ask you the same thing. Me? Look. Janey and I sealed the deal last night. You called that sealing the deal then what do you call this? You try to scare me? Look at mine, it goes all the way round. Then go down here do you need to see where it ends? Don't be shy, let me show you, come on. Alright, let me take a look. - What're you doing? - Why are you blocking me? Stop pushing me I'll do whatever I like. Tiger is taking his chance and climbs onto Champ. This position is perfect for a double attack on the head. If he gets this right he can disorientate his opponent to gain the upper hand I'm sure Champ has other ideas. Under the current circumstances he can flip Tiger over using his hip. And that is exactly what Champ has done. Locking Tiger with a thigh lock. This is an evil move which can suffocate Tiger. And with suffocation comes death. To break this lock. Tiger needs to get his arm between his legs then flip Champ over and sit on his face to reverse lock his knee caps while at it. This is an excellent move, but there are weaknesses with this lock. Because Champ is doing it right now the finger drill. Can be quite high. We are right into the heart of the match. The neck is the weakest part of the human body. And if it is locked then that'd be the end. That's why you need to keep the heads close to stop the opponent in gaining an advantage. That's awkwardly close... No, stop, no. Like basketball, MMA also has garbage time. Like right now, they have both locked each other's thumb. A lock like this may waste an awful lot of time. The world record is 20 hours, what a bored. Hey... why don't we just call it quit. Quit, quit what? We'll let go on the count of three. One, two. Doctor okay, let see him over there. I'm pregnant. The doctor can prove it. Yes, I can confirm that Jane here is pregnant. - Doctor Kuo. - Please sit. I don't trust Chinese medicine. How could you not? I dress like this but I actually practice western medicine. Graduated from Hong Kong University. Doctor Sun Yat-sen was my schoolmate. Congratulations. No offence... but do we know the father of the child? Yeah, have we met him? The father could be you. Or could be you. After I have the baby we'll get a DNA test then we'll know who the father is. Ridiculous I'm the Chief of the village. We'll do the test now if it's mine, I'll take care of you. If it's his, then I'm done. Come on, quick. Are you two nuts? She's pregnant, her hormones are going crazy all you two think about is whose baby this is you call yourself a man? Yeah, you're not a man irresponsible, no tests. Even if it is his I'll take care of everything. Don't listen to him, that wasn't what I mean. Just use my black Centapus card. Buy whatever food you want... and buy games if you're bored. Yeah, use his card for everything that needs money. But money can't buy you love and care. If you couldn't sleep... Call me. I'm a responsible man. If my card stops working pawn my watch I'm a responsible man too. If you call him at night, call me too. Oh, Udon, I'm sorry I didn't stop it in time now you're pregnant, but it's alright just keep eating, and when you give us a few puppies Charlie and I will be rich. Passport, my passport. Passport, my passport, passport... Hey... Charlie, what's wrong? Do you have 100K that I can borrow? I don't have that much, Charlie, just calm down. How old are you, don't you have any savings? I'm sorry, but you need to calm down. What has happened, tell me? Calm down. Jane is pregnant. The baby might be mine but could be Bing's. I can't deal with this I can't, help me find my passport. - Passport. - Calm down. Just calm down. Look yourself in the mirror Jane being pregnant is not a big deal. But I'm not ready to be a father. Then will yourself into being ready. What is your dream? Be a kept man. Now you've got the girl, you are halfway there. Be a kept man... and being a father are two different things. Who cares, what's important is the baby will be born in a few months time. If the baby proves to be yours. Then you will complete your dream. What if the baby is Bing's? Get a breakup fee from her. You'll be rich if it's yours you still get money if it's not. You're in a win-win situation. How can you be so calm and so spot on with your analysis. What are you on? I learned from the best but why did you hit me? Yeah, why did I hit you? Yeah. Because you got Udon knocked up I heard everything. It's not me it's this pure bred Samoyed. The puppies will fetch us hundreds of thousands. Why did you hit me again? I've taught you so well. Smart. Well done. Well done. Yes. Thank you, Charlie. Why are you buying..- so much adaptogens, something's wrong? Have you played with yourself too much? What is it, you miss your dad? He's long gone, I don't miss him anymore I'm going to be a dad. Be a dad? Wow, that means I'm a grandma. Hey, you've got a girlfriend? I get it, I'm hip and cool one night stand is alright. People today have a baby then get together all the time. What the hell, I'm going to have a grandchild I'm going to karaoke to celebrate. Mom, don't celebrate yet. There is a technical hitch. There is a 50% chance the baby's not mine. Your life is so messed up, who the hell is this girl? That's why I'm talking to you why are you shouting! Calm down... so do you like the girl? I do quite a bit. The next question is harder. If the baby is yours, I'm sure you'll be responsible. If it's not, then you don't have to. But what if it's not yours and the other guy doesn't take responsibility will you still like this girl? This question is not just harder it's damn difficult. Well, then you better sleep on it. Morning, mom. You didn't sleep last night I thought about it the whole night. And? The answer is irrelevant right now but as a man I should take care of the pregnant woman first, right? I know it's right. Thank you, mom. My boy is finally becoming a man. Thanks the Lord, I'm telling his birth parents in prayer. Hey, did you book a cab? Yes, I need to go to Central 500 dollars surcharge. That's too much, no, thank you. It's 500 either way. Hey. 500 dollars. Crazy. 500 dollars. Charlie. Why are you bullying a woman? Who are you? My favourite lo Mai gai... was sold out for breakfast. I'm already pissed off so don't push me, hold it. Then I guess I must have bought the last one. And I ate half of it. Really? Why don't you finish it first? You must be angry. If you hurt people like me, it's a worse offence, hey... Running off? Run... I didn't know someone can be more of a scoundrel than me. Foshan... Hi, Invisible Kick. Oh. Ouch, it hurts, is something wrong with my nose? Hey, can you hear that wheezing sound? It's just a graze, it's fine, take it easy. Look this way. No, I've never seen Charlie laugh, ever. Look how much he's laughing. Feck. Be a good boy now, okay... Janey, I thought about it. I want to take care of you, it'd be best if you move in with me. Piss off. I should move in and take care of her I think you should take care of your crooked nose first. My nose is crooked? Stop it! I like living on my own I'll call if I need anything. No, my nose is crooked. Bing, do you like me? Yes. Louder. Yes! Louder still. Shite! That really hurts! Stop... take a picture. No... it hurts. Still wheezing? No, the wheezing noise is gone. Thank you, Janey. You're welcome. What are you trying? - Charlie. - You heard her. When the driver was chasing after you your hand and foot became normal and ran so quickly, explain yourself. Really, I... I didn't notice it. Gosh how did this happen. It must be a miracle it must be my devotion to having a meal with every prayer. The Lord has healed me. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. I'm healed. Bull if you don't tell us everything, I'll call the cops. Explain yourself okay. Actually it's Monkey King who healed me. You asshole. Give him one last chance. Let go of her I'll tell you, just no more touching. It's my dream to be a pilot when I was a kid. It's for you. Thank you. I had a bout of fever as a child which caused the paralysis of my finger. God gave me this and I cannot be a pilot. So I decided to befriend the spasm use it to gain every advantage possible take sympathy from people who care. Do you feel anything? Not a thing, what do you think? I'm sorry my hormones are everywhere I can't control myself Charlie. I feel for you. You've been lying for so long. I'm sure it's difficult for you. It comes with the lies, I'm used to it now. But people in this village are very simple. Can't let them know about this if they find out, they'd just give up on life, alright? How would you know what they think I'm the Chief here. Bing. Can you help Charlie? I can, but you two have to do as I say. What? Villagers, after searching everywhere I've paid a lot for... qigong and acupuncture expert. She is better known as Maggie. Master Janey. Master has her own qigong and acupuncture technique... to heal Charlie. It's fake anyway, we don't need the needles. Say she knows magic, abracadabra I stand up, villagers clap. Rubbish you think this is Sailor Moon? That won't be convincing Charlie doesn't feel confident let's give him a boost. Let's start. Acupuncture shouldn't bleed does she know what she's doing? Master said if it hurts then it is blocked. Charlie's bleeding out bad blood once it stops, he's healed. Charlie's foot look the worst. A needle must be apply to the yongquan point. Not bottom of foot I'm better, look. You've lied to them for so long. Do this to make up. Yongquan point... Don't go nuts with them do you think I won't hit a pregnant woman. It'll be over quickly. Needle in his foot. I'm healed definitely. Excellent! Charlie, I'm so happy for you. Here's a rice dumpling. It's alright, you don't have to pity me anymore, I'm healed. You can give your sympathy to those who need it I like you whether you are sick or not I'm not pitying You. What's important is that you're kind... and take care of those strayed dogs. Take it... Take it... Thank you. Right... her water pipes has been blocked for some time now. Why don't you help unblock it, a little workout? Alright. But it's been block for so long why don't I get you a new one. Even better. Let's go. Hey... You are healed, don't need to hobble anymore. Yeah. I'm sorry everyone I've hobbled for most of my life. It's difficult to change right away but I'll change definitely. Thank you okay, let's change that pipe let's get some new pipes. Relax, breath in push. Push harder. Come on. Breath in. Are you nervous? No, I need to piss but I don't know where the toilet is. Isn't it over there? Thank you. They're out. Darn. Come on. Don't you need to go? Let's do it inside. - Look... there are three. - They're so cute. Look at that one. - It's like this. - So tiny? Right? Are you... Sit down, take a seat. Are you alright? Are you alright? I think the baby is kicking me. He's... It sounds fun, can I touch. Is he kicking? Yes he's kicking. He's kicking. Call me papa. Who's the papa'? Papa's over here, papa's over here. That's a big kick. Hey Bill, she gave birth let's share half the profit. Can you not sell these puppies? The mommy will be upset. But they are all black she must have been with that dog from the village, Lucky. Love in the animal world is something we can't control. Next time, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. What is this, Charlie? Bill told me they now worth around 80K each. We've got over 200K here have you gone nuts over her? Are you for real or joking, Watch your attitude! Do you know where you are? Show some respect. Look at you you're too broken to function and all for this woman you've gone backward. Do you know what you're saying? The ladies from the Charity Group all want to be with me I don't know which one of them to choose. I don't want to waste anything. So I'll have all three of them. You can hold onto your precious puppies. You're no longer my boss. Have you forgotten I'm not really paralyzed. Don't want to waste anything? You little shite. How dare you 3 times us. Yeah. Couldn't tell you would cheat at all. Serve you right Charlie, save me. What? Don't stop on my account. Bastard... Thank you. Why are we so happy watching someone being beaten up? Maybe we are bad people. Hold him. Merry Christmas... See if you like it? Merry Christmas... This is for you. Captain. Captain. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Come on... Good luck. A gold coin for you, happy new year. Thank you. Are you alright? The baby is saying Happy New Year. After the signing of contracts the optic fibre ultra speed internet project will begin. Alright, done... Congratulations... Thank you. What're you doing, making a wish? What is it? It won't come true if I tell you! But it's a wish that has you, me, Charlie and my baby in it. You... you're making the wish now? You can't cut it. Chief, come back down first. Chill out. The contract says we have to cut down the tree. Really, it says that, let me take a look. Look it's written here. Are throwing a tantrum? No. That's alright, congratulations again I'll just go, excuse me... bye-bye. Bye-bye. Go faster I'll call my lawyer. Crazy. Why are you laughing? I find it funny every time you pretend to be a bad guy. Pretend? I really am a bad guy. I think you are kind hearted. Listen... if you try to underplay my image as Chief I will hit you. We breath in from the bottom to the top then we can scream... Breath out like this, it feels like you are pushing it would help in delivery. Daddy and mommy can scream together cheer them on breath in. I'm sorry... need to take a dump. Shi Hu is coming... let's get inside. It's really coming. It's going to be here soon, come on, run. Hurry, "Shi Hu" is here. Be careful, come on. Run, it's here. It's really coming down. It's alright, it'll stop soon these sort of rain happens all the time. What is "Shi Hu"? It's local dialect for a squally thunderstorms. They come and go, with the weather better than before. Life is like "Shi Hu". Stay strong and it'll pass. Right? It's stopped. A double rainbow. I'm so happy. You're impressed by double rainbow? I've seen a quadruple one. It's been a long time since I felt like this. Happiness can be so simple simple pleasure. What? I think she said simple pleasure pleasuring yourself of course is a simple pleasure. Then it depends on how you do it. If you do it the wrong way, it can hurt. No I said simple pleasure. No, say it after me single pleasure. Single pleasure. Yes. Pleasuring yourself... Simple pleasure... Kicking your balls... Excellent. "PRENATAL AGREEMENT" I was onto you so why did you sneak in here? What're you taking a peek at? No I was changing the sheets for her and found this under the mattress. I'm not the baby's father. That's predictable. Then you no longer have to fight with me over the baby. It's better you know now. You can be the godfather, okay? You don't have to be smug. Prenatal agreement, why does she need this? Why didn't you say something? Why did you let me trash talk? Find her, ask her. It's useless asking her, she'll deny it. Or she'll just try to brush us off. Pretend I'm Jane, you ask me. What does this mean? Don't blame me I didn't want to do this I'm... I just did it for the baby. How dare you mention the baby. You can't hit a pregnant woman so it's useless asking. I'm so piss, very piss I've never been a good guy the first time I try to be, I get con. No. I have to throw something something expensive. Calm down I see it like this. That baby's father must be looking for this bitch as Jesus said. Riches come with risks Buddha said that Buddha said riches come with risk. We will feel better... once we get a million or two for snitching on her. What can I do for the two of you? That's easy what can you do for us? Master Steve is asking what can he do for you two. You help us out then we'll help you out. As a sign of my sincerity, fill in any amount you want. How much should we write? Relax... he's giving us a free rein here, let's go for it 1 million. 1 million? Is that too much? We should write 10 million if not Steve might think we look down on him. Don't be so greedy he can easily pay 100K to take us out. How much should we write? 6 million. It's over half of 10 million but it's not too much 6 million. - Write my name. - Are you nuts? - Then I'll transfer it to you. - Your name? Look here. We use the same bank. Put my name down... Then mine would be the same. Trust me, put my name down and I'll transfer to you. How old are you two why fight over a few millions. A cheque for each of you 3 million each, then you don't have to fight. That would work just want to ask, the cheque wouldn't bounced, right? If you go to Sothebby with a bounced cheque by Master Steve, it would sell for at least 100 million. It's such a great day let's open some wine to celebrate. Yeah. These two are bottles of 1945 Mouton Whatever. They cost about 400K to 500K per bottle every one drank, one less around. How many zeros are there, 1, 2, 3. Every one drank, one less around. Come on, thank you. Try it. Hey... come on it's a celebration, down the whole bottle. That's right, it's 500K per bottle. Then we'll go for it, come on. Come on. Why aren't you drinking? What is this? Why does it taste so disgusting? These were empty bottles. I filled it with the... cheap boxed wine from the supermarket. To be honest, I don't have to pay you a penny. I could just follow the two of you to find Jane. So if you want the cheque then down the whole bottle 3 million each I'll keep my word. Paying 6 million to see Jane's disappointed face is such a bargain. I don't like to push people, you can just leave. Come on. Everyone has a price. You two are only worthy of these cheap boxed wine. I didn't know boxed wine can taste so good. Here, cheers. You two are home. Honey. Sit. Honey I've finally found you. Do you know how hard have I tried? I kept worrying about when will you two find out. Obviously, you have and you brought him here. Hey, Let's play 15, 20. Alright... 5,10. 10. Why don't you just come with me I won't go back with you I've decided, this child will take my surname I will raise him without a single cent from your family. It's different now my old man got so angry at me and died last month. Yeah. No one can separate us now. Honey. I know I was useless and weak I feel so guilty. But I promise, I'll change. I want you and our baby to start a loving family. Will you really be good to the baby? I swear I will. If I'm not good to you or the baby I'd go to jail and get gang rape by big strong men. So will you come home with me? Let's go. Help missus pack her bags. It's alright, I don't need the things here. Right, we can buy new things. Be careful. 5,10. 15,10. Charlie. Don't forget you promised to take good care of Dodo 5,15. 10. Bing Open... the wishing tree works. My wish has come true. - Let's go. - It's my turn? Yeah, it's yours - 5 - Move your asses. Yeah, go back and be a sugar mama. Enjoy your own fireworks shows and lasers show every night. We've done a good thing. Of cause. Catch up some other time. Yeah, I'm going this way I'm going that way. "Every time, I hide that loving feeling away." "So I can admire you alone in my dreams." "I stole a look at you from a restaurant" "I felt lucky even though I was far away." Little girl. Dodo. I've found your Dodo, you happy? Very. "Annoying or perfect, I dream because of you." "Whether it's sunny, cloudy or raining." "Wherever I am, I'll wait for you" "I feel lucky, if you let me stick around." What are you doing, making wish again? Chief, I really miss my wife Lynn. Come on she cheats on you all the time. But still I really want her by my side. Yeah... Since I took that 1000 dollars from you I've felt like a sold out I don't feel like myself anymore. Let's give you back that money. It's okay, I don't want it. Look at me, returning that money has set me free. Lynn... Chief. What's happening to you? As you say, I don't feel myself so I look like a sold out. That's amazing! Lynn? You'll come home tonight! This tree works... I'll wait for you with my trousers down. Even though Charlie and Bing are not the father I wish they can be the baby's godfathers. Wish they are both safe and healthy and won't meet another bad woman like me. What's up, Bing? You can't sleep? Looks like you can't sleep either! That's why I want to talk okay, where? Somewhere quiet 10, 15, 15, 20. Why are you so picky tonight? Yeah. I normally pick the not so pretty ones from the 1st round I've always wanted to be a bad guy now I am and gotten millions for it. I actually feel worse I've conned people my whole life Jane is the first person to have conned me. I actually miss her. Do you think she misses us? Will she blame us? She's on her own. Don't think about it, cry it out. What a nutcase what kind of man chooses to cry here. People come here to be happy crying just spoils the fun. I'm not talking about you two I'm talking about the four eyes next door I already found him the best two models. But he just keeps on crying way worse than you two. What the... if he's crying with models won't we need to hang ourselves? No, I'm not talking about you girls... Yeah, you girls are not worth it. What sort of man is he? Crying next to two models he gives us man a bad name. Yeah let me pull his dingy out and use it as a fishing bait. My boss is an animal. That's the crying guy. Hey, isn't that Steve's assistant? Why don't you keep crying and we'll go out for some food. Don't you dare, I'll chop your legs off. Watch me cry. My boss is an animal... Hey, shouldn't you two ask me why I think my boss is an animal? Oh, so why is your boss an animal? Since you asked, let me tell you. Do you know why I want to get my son back? It's your own blood your next of kin. Of course you care. Do I look like I want a son? I waited so long for my father to die. Why would I want to split my fortune with a son? You must be kidding. You know how my sperm count is low because I've had so much sex. But somehow I still managed to knock up Honey. So this baby has a high experimental value. That's why I've agreed with a fertility drug manufacturer in Africa to send the baby there for experiment once it is born. They'll even name the drug after me with a 30% share of profit. What will happen to the baby? Come on, who cares about the lab rat? Steve's house will be well guarded by bodyguards and butler I think I better stay. It's alright I've got some sleeping smoke in here. It can take out an elephant for a few days. Is it ready? Let's take a look. Is it ready? Let's take a look. Wait. Is it ready? Have to take a look. Are you two here for Master Steve? He just went out. Hey, why did you two faint outside? I'm anaemic and in menopause. Oh, that's serious I better call you an ambulance. No. We just need to find ourselves a drink in the toilet where is it? Okay, toilet is upstairs. Janey... How did you two get in here? We'll talk about that later. You and your baby are in grave danger. Come with us now I'll pack I know everything, I'll deal with you two later. - What, you... - Let's go. Hey, wait... The butler wouldn't let us take her with us. There's no other way. Beat him up you use this candle to whack him - I'll protect Jane. - No... he's too old, I couldn't do it. Let me protect Jane, and you do it. He's so old, I'm afraid I'd kill him. Oh, I'll do it. Slowly... I told you the smoke works. - Yeah. - The sleeping smoke, cover your nose... Go... What's happening? I think I'm in labour. In labour? Take her to the hospital. We can't go to the hospital Steve will easily find her. We won't be able to fight off rich people like him. Go back to the village hall call my mom to get the doctor move. They are here. Hurry up. Come on, get her inside. Be careful. You two stand guard here. Be careful. Slowly. Mind the steps. Are you okay? Hold on... You'll be fine... Sit over here... How're you feeling? It hurts like hell. What's up, doctor? Doctor's okay I'm asking you how's the delivery going? Can you ask someone else to do it? I'm shy and have never delivered a baby before. Why don't we call an ambulance? We wouldn't be here, if we could take her to a hospital. You'll be fine. What should we do, if you can't do it, do I have to? Shut up! I'll do it. Morn? You've never even had a child stop messing around. I'm not. I never had a child. But I watched babies delivery on. Discovery Channel out of curiosity. The ones you watched are about rattlesnakes. Snakes are from eggs, we are mammals can you really do this? Then you two do it I'm sorry it's all yours, thank you. A posh car is coming into the village. Could it be Steve? Don't let him take my baby okay... We'll deal with Steve, take your time, relax. Leave it to me, it'll be fine. Let's get some protection on oh, I mean gloves. You put them on. Hey, Steve, what made you come out here? Yeah, it's so late. Where's my honey? Baby cannot wait much longer you have to push, or he will suffocate. Try to push again. It'd be dangerous. My butler said you two took her. If you hand her over I can pretend none of this happened. But he's 80 years old, maybe he got it wrong. Wow, his butler is 80? That's not right - you should let him retire or he might sue you - Yeah. Wipe the sweat okay... Not mine. It's not sweating. Hers. - Oh, her. - I can't do this. Since you are all here why don't I take you guys for a hotpot. What's their specialty? Omasum, very crunchy but can't be boiled for too long. Alright, I'll deal with that. All of you, come on. Hey, let's shuffle. Do you two think I'm stupid? This hurts so much. When you feel like taking a dump. You just push the baby out, okay? Push. Attack. Push some more... I can't. Push harder, like when you're constipated. Mom, how's Jane doing? She's not doing well she doesn't know how to push Jane, do you remember the yoga classes taught you how to breath? Breath in deeply then push while screaming. We'll do it together. Breath in. Push. It's working. Breath in and push. Did I not feed you? Push harder! Honey, I'm here. Ignore him, focus. Push, Jane. Let go. Ignore him... Again... Breath in and push. Let go, or I'll kick your ass. Harder... okay. Not you asshole! The baby's here. Mom, is the baby a boy or girl. He's a boy. He's a boy, Charlie. I have my own son. Does he look like me, Bing's Mom? Why would he look like you? Save your breath, losers. Obviously, it'll look like me. Why are you standing here, take the baby. Why don't we let him go. Then who will let me off? You take care of them. 100K to the one who gets the baby. She's just a housewife, go! Freeze! Everyone freeze. You guys are finally here. If you came in any later they would have had a taste of my Tai Chi. It's alright Bing's morn. Arrest these two. Bing. Come here... are you alright? Mom? Help me please. You two are just constable, get out of my way. Do you know who I am? The Star of Charities, Steve. Sir. I want to report a crime. This Star of Charities beat me up a disabled person. Get lost, stop pretending I have a card okay... I believe you. You look so paralyze, put away your card. Thank you. Please help us here. You are the Star of Charities, right? We've had a tip-off, you are stealing a baby. Steal? My lawyer can be a witness. We have a verbal agreement the baby will be mine once it is born. As far as I can see the baby has just been born. The umbilical cord is still attached to the mother I will believe this more than any verbal agreement you had. Are you mute, say something. Hey, I play the bad guy every time I've had enough. This guy has done a lot of bad things I have loads of evidence, arrest him. Are you trying to hit someone in front of police officers? Stay. You could be in jail for some time. Law can't punish rich people like me I know that law can't punish rich people like you. That's why I'll arrange for you to stay in the same cell as sex offenders. When you get out your chrysanthemum will be like a sunflower. You can't scare me. Do you know many of my relatives are judges plus... Shut up, rich boy. Just walk, big mouth. Oh, I... I can't breath I need an ambulance, an ambulance. Watch it. Abuse of police power I need all of you to leave a statement but the baby has just been born. Yes. Then we can do it later after the baby has graduated from university. Thank you, sir. Baby, baby. Godson, godson. Bing... Where's Jane? Where's Jane? Who's that mug? Does he have haemorrhoids? Is he playing me with paralysis? Look at him. He walks exactly like you. Where's that cucumber on your head? I gave it to Louis Koo. Is he on yet? Louis Koo is playing him? Louis Koo. His English name is Lewis Koo. LEWIS No. Why not. Cut, this shot's okay I'm sorry but the hair fell off, don't we need another take? Audience can't see these things. Camera over there. Filmmaking in H.K. is so casual, anyone can be a director. Yeah. Janey, congratulations. Your best selling novel being made into a film I just finished reading. Do you like it? It's boring as hell. You just wrote about your pregnancy. It's basically a diary. Without Charlie or me in it how could you have sold 900K of them? You'd be in deep shit. I'm joking just give us a share of profit. Yu Bo is here. Godson. Baby... Say godfather, say godfather. Ignore him, he's just a random guy I'm the godfather Charlie. GiGi. Hello, Udon... Pretty, right? Gigi... She really likes me.
