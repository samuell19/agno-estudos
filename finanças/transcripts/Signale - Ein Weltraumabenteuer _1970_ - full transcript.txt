Signals a space adventure Latest report from the space security headquarters. The spacecraft 'Ikaros' is situated near Jupiter. Will this research work bring us nearer to the realisation of the old dream of mankind, to get in touch with intelligent beings from other solar systems? The new millennium lies ahead of us. The earth is greeting you, cosmonauts. There is no doubt. That's signals from reasonable creatures. We're lucky. We've really made it. Radar unit has registered a swarm of strays. The meteorites belong to the order of: MX 5 to 12. Objects are heading for a collision. Course correction, programming runs. Red alert. Located. Can you see that disturbance? Could be a plasmic cloud. Distance: 50 Are you hurt Krystina? What is our outlook? Signals I couldn't believe you're coming. Why didn't you come 4 weeks earlier? It was fun here. Together we would have turned the beach upside down. Terry, don't forget tonight. I'll bring backup. Without me. I'm going to meet your commander at the space security HQ tonight. You'd be well advised to not let those fellows wait. You have checked all the documents, haven't you? Everything has been done. Yes, that's right. And nevertheless you hold up your application? How can you justify that? Not at all. There is no reason. At least not a sensible one. Our supporting vehicles couldn't find anything, neither the manned ones, nor the unmanned ones. The circuit, in which accident parts of the Ikaros could be scattered has a diameter of at least 10 to the power of 15 square km. Sure, I admit, if there were sensible reasons for my application, the 'Ikaros' would have been found already. You really did everything imaginable here at the SSH. There it is in black and white, the probability is 0,000. let's assume I'd put through the flight application for you, how could I justify the composition of the crew you require? Konrad is already on the way. Really? What did you tell him? The truth. I've read his publication on radio waves in the band. So what? Nothing but that, except for one thing... well, I've got a repair order... in fact within the planetoid belt. I mean I will have. And what was his reaction? First he thought it over for a while and then, then he said he'd join the flight to be sure. What do you suppose were his thoughts? I would say he thought about the flight path, and in this regard, which space sectors we'll be crossing thereby. And he asked no questions? That was very likeable to you, wasn't it? Would you like to let your crew in on this? No, I think that'd be wrong for several reasons, want to hear them? - No, come along. The repair order thing is not bad at all, you gave me an idea. Go ahead. The spool is stuck. If you take any longer we can't play with it anymore today. Be quite. I'll have it fixed in a second. I made a new gear shift ready, some kind of a colour button, My daddy said it's a smasher if it's working. And now take a deep breath and start screaming 'goal'. Let's go. Fabulous. Great. I admire your nerves. If I had been so close to the catastrophe as you were, I wouldn't be so eager to start again. As well as the Ikaros it could have hit you. Actually, how's work? Still radio waves. I'm analysing super low frequencies within the X band, especially... Give it a rest. X band... X legs, that's what we can discuss about. X legs? Don't ever say that again. Mind what you're doing. Have a go at it. It's our turn. Luna north, get in touch please. There you are. Luna north, copy. Taking over RT 906 via conducting ray 11. Navigation forbidden for all working vehicles within space sector number 3. Are we supposed to send the Laika crew right now? Agreed. Detachment level 2 plus 10. Level 3 with automatic control to Laika. Hi Gaston, I hope you brought a little bottle from Paris. Not a bottle, a girl. Pressure normal, crew handover to the Pilotron, repeat: crew handover to the Pilotron. Here's the flight confirmation by the SSH, the crew list including the test logs, and the flight order. What nice surprises do you have this time? I have already compiled everything you need to know. Look here. You manoeuvred 14 of them into the planetoid belt? And everything without failures? Of course. The most important thing was the gradual adjustment to the average velocity of orbit. So, we're going set off on the spot. Cleaning the windows or something? Certain sections shall be replaced on schedule, before they show signs of fatigue. I have already transferred everything to your on board computer. A lot of information. Veikko, the boss wants to talk to you. Veikko. So, you agree on everything? Yes. Any reasons why I shouldn't agree? I totally disagree. Two new crew members, and both inexperienced... Furthermore... Two of your old crew, one of them... how shall I put it... a bit too old. And the other one just recovered from a heavy shock... His medical test results are low, but only if one bends the rules, my dear frien.. Anything else? We know the reason. His girl met with an accident. On the Ikaros. Nobody knows how it could actually happen. Up to now it's been a mystery. No surprise. Of course the whole thing shocked him. You want to help him? But how? By occupational therapy. Great. But we are not a sanatorium. And who's going be responsible for all that, Veikko? The responsibility thing is another story, you know. It's always tied to a decision. A decision, which can be either wrong or right. Do you think as a commander you have to accept failure because you made wrong decisions? If it was like that, even computers could do our work. But it's not as simple as that and it will never be. Attention. Doppler 5 seconds... 4,8... Well, you brightly polished our old banger. Special repair level. The boss personally looked around here every day. Minus 200... 150... 120... Intensified security regulations. Since the Ikaros disaster everything has become harder here. Well Terry, get back to the drive sector. Meanwhile, I'll call Samira. Samira. Samira. What's it like over there? Ready when you are. Look to your sensors, we're going start with checking pulse rate and breathing. Hey old jester, let me see your pulse. This one's twenty years younger. You should go to your nice doctor as well, too many weightless hours lately I'd say... It wasn't so bad at all. You seem to be in top form today, Veikko. Am I? Do you know what I did? I called the space security, they will cancel your flight, I expect their reply any minute. Don't get me wrong, but I couldn't help it. One 'Turkish' as usual. Have a good flight and... give my compliments to Terry. Of course, I will. and from Rosie. Oh, well. Of course I am supposed to send you his regards as well. Here's the SSH. Now they will come to a decision. What's it like? Would you like to talk to them, Veikko? No, it was your idea. This is commander Luna north speaking. SSH, we don't understand your request. I've got the log here. Flight order and composition of the crew, by special order of commander Veikko. The committee has agreed, that's all I can say. Will this do? Cancel my request. I'm surprised as you can see. Flight order and composition of the crew by your special order? Why didn't you tell me about that, Veikko? Well, you asked the space security, not me. And what was your reason? You won't tell me you hadn't any special reason, will you? It's Gaston's 25th anniversary as a cosmonaut. Don't forget the flowers please. You're not good at telling lies, Veikko. Attention, security gate. All functions checked, pressure normal. Flight control in one minute, Hummingbird 1 and 2. Hurry up Pawel, the HQ is already done with Veikko. Tell him to drink another cup of coffee, I will do that scenic flight with the new lady without haste. My name's Juana. Perhaps you will keep that name in mind. Site channel B, site channel B, Laika flight control, Hummingbird 1 and 2. Site channel B, flying ban for all vehicles, security level 3, repeat: site channel B... Juana ready? Pawel ready? Start Hummingbird 2. Running. Attention. Manual course correction. Safety distance: Automatic 50. You will need the big spanner, whether you want to or not. Steering nozzle 5. I'm already on my way. Attention. Space baptism for little girls. Do you agree Gaston? Can she cope with this? Twice like that... and ready. All values amazingly normal. Even when the malfunction appeared. There's nothing to worry about. Konrad. Report to Luna north. Report is already on it's way. Thumbs up. You're able to think for yourself. What's your temperature panel saying? Pulse rate considerably increased. Still increasing. Breathing now very shallow. She will pass out with lack of oxygen, Gaston. Juana. Juana can you hear me? Enough gymnastics. Now slowly tuck up your legs and arms, then take a rest. And in case you should get bored while waiting for Pawel to pick you up, repeat the prime numbers up to 100,000. You have a calming influence on little girls, that's new to me, but thumbs up. Thank you for the compliment. You'll have to write a loss report for your spanner. The SSH will give it a name, a number plus the appellation 'mini-planet'. And you will receive a reprimand, Juana. Outdoor job without a leash. Let's go on. Control drive sector. Terry, Cooling film minus 100... 120... Latest report from the space security headquarters. Orbital station Luna north released space vehicle Laika for departure. Space vehicle has already left the orbit. Work order within the planetoid belt. Earth greets you, cosmonauts. Aerial sensor Alpha 19 undocked. Coordinates: 19 13 76 00 12 44. Every time we cross the alpha belt I have to swallow. In the past I was horror struck sometimes... the tremendous emptiness... of space. Hey Veikko, are you listening to me? I'm philosophising. Philosophy is my pet project. Get on with it. Philosophy starts with questions. With questions or curiosity? Well, questions sounds better. It's been on my mind since we took off. Tell me, there were troubles with the space security? Who's telling that? Well, you got into trouble with the boss of Luna north, didn't you? How come? Keep one thing in mind: The one who knows the secretary, knows everything about the boss. Do you know her? I don't. Terry does. Well, shift changeover already? Just leave your belongings there, I won't touch anything. Thanks, re arranging the whole thing takes a lot of time. There was nothing special going on. You were close to the Ikaros when it happened? To say I was close by, that would be exaggerated. But concerning the distance to the earth... Yes. Did you have the opportunity to do radio wave tests over there? Successful? Yes and no. You know, it's like being a stalking hunter. After persevering for weeks, you finally spot the desired deer... but only for 3 seconds. What can one say about it? You know cock and bull stories can kill scientists. The Ikaros made no emergency call? No... Obviously the catastrophe came unexpectedly and quickly. One has only to push a button to make an emergency call. It is known that the emergency call has been saved on every spaceship for more than 50 years. I don't see your point, Pawel. It might be possible that you missed hearing it. I still don't get it. Listen, I can see your experimental apparatus, you were working on them, and perhaps... You know that for a radio engineer there's no insult worse than that. Then as now, I'm working on separate apparatus, that's self-evident. Furthermore the emergency call is programmed... for 50 years, which means that it will switch over to memory, even if all receivers are turned off, followed by sending an alarm signal. I know all this. Cosmonauts school, second training course. But for me it's not an explanation anyway. Somebody must have failed, otherwise the accident wouldn't have happened. Or at least we had a tiny, tangible clue. Let's call it a day, Juana. Now it's my turn. You will certainly win the next training contest by far. The student's level is still determined by the coach's level. I suppose you agree I start with the old timer? I want to double the strain today. Well, let's see how's your condition. Is the commander also exercising regularly? Why? Well, he looks bad in my opinion. Perhaps he doesn't sleep well. Or is he worrying about something? In this case, Samira would have informed us. Any suggestions? Maybe Veikko knows something and we don't. Possible, but why is he not informing the crew? Not every information is necessary and helpful to everybody. - An old problem. Does it still apply on these conditions? Seven people alone in space for more than a year, on their own, How can one be able to take this knowledge, which he's withholding from the others? He may believe he needed to be in charge all by himself. Don't you think he might want to share his knowledge with at least one of us? Of course. But he can't. Why? It would split the crew if he only trusted one person. The collective would go to pieces as soon as the knowledge was known. So he has to bear the load all by himself. No one can help him. There must be an important reason to justify such a behaviour. - Yes, of course. Very important...and most humane. All values normal. The technical values, yes. Yours are not. Veikko, you seem to be groggy. Now I know why you pulled out of the medical examination. A case so unique, that there's no intended paragraph in the disciplinary code. I double checked that. So did I. Do you really think you're ready to take on the responsibility? I doubt that. Samira, listen closely. I'm alright. Too bad you don't want to be helped. The pressure test is over, finished. What a pity. I had more success with my robot, and dialogues from my ancient collection of crime thrillers. I didn't know you're such a great tinkerer. What else is he able to do? - I adjusted it to be very easy to reprogramme the whole thing. Where shall I send him? To the cafeteria? What do you want him to serve? Well, let's say a refreshing drink. 2 soft drinks, vitamin a, b, c, to serve. What are you going to do with this? Nothing yet. But listen. This is an old recording. How do you feel about this? Well, that's all? Not so fast. I will add a filter. 3Hz 4 That's more like it. How did you figure out that it's not just noise? Except for the tireless spirit of research, it was a fortunate coincidence. You know what it's like if one becomes deeply absorbed in something. Those signals are not sent by a geothermal prob.. Do you suspect something like reasonable creatures behind it? At least it would be possible. You know, it's very strange, those signals are in a millimetre range, which actually can't be received on earth. I'm not an expert on the subject of radio waves, but as much as I remember from school... the atmosphere of our earth absorbs millimetre waves. I presume through water vapour. Correct. You really paid attention, back then. Well, it's been a while since then. There was a girl in my class, she had long hair... as long as that. Stick to your water vapour. And your conclusion? The one who's sending those signals must be living in an atmosphere without water vapour. As every sender wants his messages to be received. I have another conclusion. The sender wants his messages only to be received by people... who are able to move beyond their water vapour shield layer. Only by people, who are technically developed, so that communicating with them makes sense. Hats off. What's on? Serve it. Tell me Terry... You rascals. Teasing a little girl, that's what you're int.. Gaston just asked me if there's still people in our century who are afraid of robots. What do you think Juana? Not afraid of robots, but of jesters. Transmission time for Luna north. Will you check the radio coder right now? Yes, I will. This is commander Veikko speaking. Piazzi 1 to 4, repair interchange as planned. New course approach to the Piazzi track. Immediate report via M 10 after reaching the target area. Medical examination of all crew members completed, all values standard. Course correction, plus 5 Make sure that your trip is not going to take longer than 4 hours, this will save us another course correction and a lot of fuel. Difficult to say, there's quite a few more pieces than expected. I think I will try to emerge from the bottom up, one can't do it... with the program control only. Those three pieces over there, the difference in speed so enormous, I don't know how to slip through. No worries, i will calculate a partial programme, based on this meteorite over there. To me it seems to be the most dangerous one on the way to Piazzi 5. Let's call him 'Ottokar'. Guide beam 30 degrees. This bird is ready for take off. Thanks a lot for your help, Terry. Actually I should have done the work all by myself. Pure selfishness. Finally I would like to get back. In case the repair takes a little longer, send some hot tea. With lemon or milk? With rum, I trust. Tell me Veikko, who was Mr. Piazzi, actually? An Italian astronomer, who lived from 1746 until 1826. Believe it or not, he discovered the first planetoid on January 1, 1801. But why do you want to know? Well, just in case he's sitting over there, waiting for us. Hummingbird start plus 3. Keep going, otherwise the automatic programme will become heated. Your programme is brilliant, Pawel. 'Ottokar' is nowhere to be seen. Wait and see. First we'll have the second correction. You're playing tricks on us... Well then, we'll wait and see. You're quite silent... Terry is just about to kiss Juana, so I didn't want to disturb. Gaston, don't fool around, you must see 'Ottokar' now. I see him more clearly than I prefer. If you're out in your calculations, 'Ottokar' will be sitting down on my lap in one minute at the latest. Konrad, let me know what you radio orientation is saying. This will be a close thing. But we knew that already. Alright, Gaston. You're a genius, Pawel. are you still alive? Damn. You just gave us a real fright. Why don't you say anything? What was going on? Hey Veikko. You mean over here? Nothing was going on over here. Or have you seen anything? No, I haven't. I had both eyes shut. Well, wait and see, until your back. In case you're interested, we can see Mr. Piazzi's weekend cottage in our driving mirror. Terry is already getting ready to take off. How is it? Well done, Terry. I probably had a goose egg now. My velocity wasn't adjusted very well, that's why I slipped off. Now I'm twisting the rope, you can come now. Ready to take off. Attention Laika. Terry and Gaston dropped off. Hummingbird linked to Piazzi 5 via rope hawser. Well Juana, initially situation report every 3 minutes. Right. Send over the trainee, Juana. We want to start. Already on his way, Gaston. 15 minutes, that's a short while my dear child. I know. Remember, you will need at least 2 or 3 minutes for passing in and out. - Right. The oxygen won't last much longer. I know. Krystina, the most important thing is to be back in here in 15 minutes. The most important thing is to find parts for a functioning emergency transmitter. Otherwise we will remain a lifeless hunk of metal. An iron meteorite. If any radar signal will reach us ever again. There's one more thing I'd like to know... How much longer will the medicine last? Some of us already have distinct symptoms of anxiety. Focus on your work now, outside. There's nothing left. We're running out of oxygen. You need to sleep. Well, well. You're reading my dissertation, do you like it? No, not particularly. I don't like it either. So, keep it in suspense. Tell me, what type of person was Krystina? Keep Krystina out of it. She's dead. I know it. But I don't know why. Why... a good question. Maybe the most humane. But in your case it fails. Why don't you try to answer it? Why oh why? A textbook question. But it doesn't always work. Not only in my case. In your case as well. Why did you pull out of the medical examination? Maybe you feel your strength fading. Maybe you're afraid of the age. Maybe you're afraid of not being allowed to fly anymore. Get on with it. I don't blame you for it. Far from it. I'm impressed by a commander, who's acting at his own discretion. But then let me also live at my discretion. Well, and how do you want to live? I get my daily job done. Am I conscientious? Punctual? So, what do you blame me for? Nothing. But you had good reason to do so. You got me out of the sanatorium, got me the flight permission, and now I'm disappointing you like this. No self discipline. So, you could blame me for ungratefulness at least. Sorry about that. Gaston will be astonished. I'll be ready in a second. In space for 25 years. A connoisseur. Otherwise he wouldn't have made it. Try it on. I think it will go very well with the silver shade of your dress. We go back a long way. Once I visited him. By the way, he has five sons and two daughters. Have you ever taken a serious interest in him? Why do you ask? Because we're philanderers? It doesn't mean much. You know, that's part of space psychology. Let me see. Well? How do you like it? It's you Terry. I know, you'd prefer Gaston as your French fashion adviser. You look adorable, Juana. Stay, Juana. It concerns all of us. Pawel just asked me to cede the radio and radar sentry during the whole celebration to him. I think in this special case, one should respect his wish. Dear Gaston, that was the longest speech I've ever heard. And, now, our congratulations to the most experienced cosmonaut will be delivered by the youngest. Gaston, and what about me? I've tried to calculate your total flight kilometres. Unfortunately our electronic brain would collapse with such a huge number. A message from earth, which I've kept secret, even from the commander. Ladies and Gentlemen, please take your seats. In the first section you will see the shivering drama 'The Love life of Gaston Le F?vre'. The administration would like to point out courteously, that this masterpiece is X rated. What's the matter? Alarm? No, not an alarm. Follow me. Now we know that Konrad received these signs for the first time at the very same moment when the 'Ikaros' was perishing. In all likelihood, the Ikaros received these signals as well. At least they stood a chance to receive them. Go on. Konrad is of the opinion that these signs could possibly originate from sophisticated, galactic creatures. So, the Laika is possibly at the same risk as the Ikaros. I don't think that this conclusion is absurd. I'm not afraid, but senseless deaths... shouldn't be repeated. If commander and crew are of the opinion that my work could put the security of Laika at risk, then I won't persevere in my attempt to receive signals. I do not know the cause of the Ikaros disaster, nobody does, but those signals... have nothing to do with it. And I'm sure Veikko is of the same opinion. One of the most essential conditions for the advance into galactic areas is to banish any thoughts of destruction and aggression. Only then will one's abilities be fully developed and incorporated into society. Already in the last century it generally became clear, what enormous achievements must be kept reserved for us. Pardon me. I just wanted to say that I symapthise with Konrad's views, highly developed existence means peaceful existence. One last question, Veikko. Were you speaking as a philosopher or as a commander? Do you have a sudden burst of double vision? Laika copy. First Gaston shall... Listen, I accessed the Piazzi receiver. Do you call that a joke? That's your signals Konrad. Answer me. I'm not in the mood for jokes. My test instruments are not even active. I'm coming. In the meantime ask Juana if she was on reception as well. Attention. Laika calls Hummingbird. Now keep a stiff upper lip. Attention. Laika calls Hummingbird. Attention. Laika calls Hummingbird. Juana, have you been on reception? Please transfer your data logs. I never expected a reception at that early period. Soonest from space sector A7, in about 2 weeks. Alright. No doubt. But I'd really like to know how these signals came into the Piazzi memory. Call them once again. Memory is sending. What's the matter, Pawel? Your FP values increased rapidly. Konrad's signs. Do you know who's sending them? The Piazzi memory. Are you serious? What does it mean? I think it can only mean, that Veikko's peaceful creatures are able to send within our frequencies. Juana. Ask them why they're permanently accessing the radio memory. They're driving me mad. We would like to work on sector 3 now. Laika, Laika, Hummingbird calls Laika. Samira. Hurry up. What's wrong, Veikko? Are you disappointed? Why? We face a discovery, which mankind has been dreaming of for a thousand years. They're on our frequencies, can you imagine that? And they know the code numbers for Piazzi. You aren't afraid of this encounter, are you? Aren't you pleased about it? I've been working on this problem for six years and now we're close to it's solution. That was your hope as well, wasn't it? That's why you joined me. Not for that reason. Stop outdoor work immediately. Attention. B alert. Attention. Attention. B alert. I was afraid Pawel could get another shock. Now he will sleep for an hour, he will be fully fit afterwards. Come, give me a hand. What happened? They're sending within our frequencies and they know the Piazzi code. Here's Luna north, I'm curious to hear what they will say about our message. Veikko, here's Luna north. Detonation... unmanageable, Space computer has calculated that an encounter with galactic creatures is improbable. The commander has a free hand in making a decision. But remember the first space flight law: Safety first. Now the repetition. Transmit the confirmation afterwards. If I were allowed to add a little slogan like... The personal opinion is worth its weight in Gold. You know what it is? The Ikaros identification. Hear that? The Ikaros. They're alive. Pawel... Konrad has perfectly calculated, that these signals are sent from a mobile source, which may mean two things. First: there are survivors of the Ikaros disaster, and that it's not impossible that the signs originate from a memory, as the last legacy of the crew. Second: that we will have an encounter with a galactic spacecraft, and we must expect... that they adopted the Ikaros identification for communicative reasons. or to trap us... Samira, how's Pawel doing? As of now, he's fit again. So he will be on the first radar watch with me immediately. We were together in our first cosmonauts course, Pawel, Krystina and me. It was... It was like a theatrical performance of Romeo and Juliet. Do you know what I mean? Of course without the Capulets and all that... The whole thing was invested with a passion, sometimes I thought... we'll be speaking in verses any moment. C alert. Unidentified flying object located. I will take tracking via our computer. A metallic flying object. Seems to be V shaped. One of us. Look at this. I've never seen such a track before. A 'spin movement', if we had a term like that. Now your philosophy will be put to the test. Thank you for remembering me at this time. Hummingbird, all systems are go. Konrad, are we within their radar location? No two way location. Nothing moves over there. Terry, Juana and Pawel will go by the Hummingbird. Alarm start 30. Hummingbird start normal, course correction and acceleration in 10 seconds. Samira, can we take the responsibility? All values normal. Please show me your hands. I think you trembled a lot better once before. It's the Ikaros. There's no doubt about it. There. I can see it clearly, it's the Ikaros. It's the wreck of Ikaros. Veikko. Are you listening? It is the Ikaros.. Ready to take off. You got exactly 17 seconds to get over there. Good girl. If we're hit by the 'spinning motion' it's over for us. I can get a little closer. Attention, Juana. Don't bother. Juana has a good eye and is doing almost as well as Gaston. I would say just as well as I do. I'd recommend you to accelerate immediately after getting off. You might cope without doing so, but accelerating will give you... a safety margin of 2 or 3 seconds. One other thing... Strap yourself into the belt as soon as you're across. The turning moment might be stronger than your muscles. Your moving direction differs from the spin direction, round about 30 degrees. Juana, you're close enough now. After the next rotation you will first drop Pawel off. Alright? Ready to take off. off. What's happened? I didn't get off. I was distracted in some way. Copy. So, with the next rotation. Pawel? Terry will get off with the next rotation. Tell me, since when did Terry have nerves? That's just one of his tricks, his values are absolutely normal. What tricks? Terry off. I think he's only showing his anxiousness and insecurity, which gives Pawel a feeling of superiority. At the moment that's good for him. I look towards the central cylinder, Juana, go a little further, the two of them might cause a little deviation from the course. Terry? -Yes Juana, anything wrong? I'm alright. And how about you? - The Pilotron has been damaged. Must have been a swarm of meteorites. Certainly, all of them were instantly destroyed. I will look after Pawel. The silence is driving me mad. Samira. Say something at least. Only the commander may demand information from me. What shall we do if Terry fails in getting Pawel out of the ring? Gaston, the commander has more important things to do than answering pointless questions. You should rather ask Juana what's wrong, I don't get anything out of them. Laika calling Hummingbird. Juana, please report to the commander. The central cylinder is empty. Pilotron obviously damaged by meteorites. The ring is empty, there's no Ikaros survivors. Central cylinder has been torn open, Pilotron obviously damaged by a swarm of meteorites. Why can't you hear us? Krystina, what can we do? Our direct transmission power is not nearly strong enough. It's all about the Piazzi. I can only send the most recent recordings on memory, our identification and signals. I modified the transmission rate. They didn't catch it. I see only one last chance, Increasing the boost of our transmission power. In the course of this, our emergency transmitter might break down. Once and for all. Got that? Laika calls Hummingbird, Pick up, Pawel and Terry, Hummingbird, return flight adapter 2. Hummingbird, copy. We must take the risk. There's no alternative. At once. Go. I will count at the next rotation. But first on a trial run. Got that? Sounds like a good idea to use the drive of the rotation to get away. Off. Excuse me, I was a little late. Next time it will certainly work out better. What if this hadn't been a test? But it was a test. I guess it's time to retire. Don't have to worry about new blood anymore. Now listen carefully. This is first hand. It is not inside the wreck. You must receive the coordinates every second. One other thing... The modification of the transmission rate didn't happen by accident. They increased their transmission power. Obviously uncontrolled. The message was interrupted shortly after the Ikaros identification. Don't pass out now. You... Have you actually considered... how long they hold out in there? Despair, hope... despair... And now get some rest, otherwise you'll claim all the glory for yourself. All the glory for myself... A spaceship commander who passes out at the decisive moment. You're talking nonsense, Veikko. You carried that burden all by yourself for months. No wonder that it resulted in a collapse. We are almost... out of the range of Hummingbird. So, there's only one way open to us... to turn the Laika upside down and put on the brakes. Are you insane? Such a dangerous maneuver without the commander's approval. What is your opinion? Do you need somebody to help you? Or just somebody to assume responsibility? Do you hear that? They just deactivated the main engine. Stay lying down. The boys won't drive your Laika into a tre.. After all it was you who qualified them. What's the distance, Konrad? Doppler shows them just within the Hummingbird range. Well then... Terry, I'm going to stay here with Pawel. And you take the boys for the takeover. And hurry. Gaston is right, you really have to hurry up. Their last emergency call may have caused a total power outage. And now they're possibly running out of oxygen. Don't exaggerate, Samira. It was mere coincidence. I haven't done anything special. I took classes in the SSH aid programme I absolutely couldn't see anything wrong with it. I couldn't see any opportunity. None of us did. I was of the same opinion until I've read something in a book... What have you read, Veikko? Only a definition. A definition? What definition? The term 'coincidence' was defined as follows: 'A remarkable concurrence of events or circumstances without apparent causal connection'. Yes, like that. It was only this single sentence, but for me it was the spur for everything that followed afterwards. If the others get wind of it, they will certainly have another board doctor next time. You got that? ...Terry hurry up... ...Terry get in touch...Terry hurry up...Terry... Copy. Can you make it alone? Attention. Oxygen supply via Hummingbird reserve. Samira, Samira I'm waiting. Everything has been prepared. No frequency on AC. Laika, copy. Have you got PR connections? I need the values urgently. ...Hurry...Terry you must hurry up....hurry... Pawel? Have you got that? Are you listening? Juana, please repeat. I didn't catch Terry's words. Samira, Samira I'm waiting. Good thing your coming, Veikko. Luna north and SSH think I'm foolish. Your turn to confirm this message. Well, let me see... Maybe they will trust me. Laika calling SSH. This is the commander of Ikaros speaking. After exactly 300 days we were found by the Laika crew. Greetings Earth. Our home. And now, ladies and gentlemen I invite you for a little walk along the beach. Let's go. We never were that foolish in our younger days, right, Veikko? Not like that. Even worse.
