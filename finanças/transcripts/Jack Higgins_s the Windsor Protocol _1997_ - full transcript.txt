(dramatic music) (explosions booming) - [Narrator] May, 1945. The Nazi empire was crushed. From Hitler's bunker, one final attempt to resurrect the fallen Reich was smuggled out. The Windsor Protocol. A briefcase containing the names of Nazi sympathizers and secret bank accounts in the billions of dollars. The U-boat carrying the briefcase disappeared without a trace. 50 years later, the Protocol resurfaced and Hitler's master plan was set in motion. - There is going to be a change in the air soon. A big, big change. I can feel it. (foreboding music) - 37 countries representing the haves and have-nots of the world have sent delegates to the so-called North-South economics symposium Here in Montreal, Canada. (crowd chanting) I don't know where this other delegation is. They seem to be late getting here. I mean, this thing is supposed to start. There's a bus pulling up now in front of the institute. Hopefully it will be the final- (tires screech) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (sirens blaring) - Down on the seats. - This is an outrage. I am an official representative- - Sit the fuck down! - I demand to be treated with respect. - You'll get my respect, now sit down! (tense music) (sirens blaring) - Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Okay, everybody this way. Come! Go! Go! (woman shrieks) Move! Go! (men yell) (woman shrieks) - Get in there! - All right! All right! (crowd yelling) (man laughs) - Pop him again Nigel. Teach the Yank about the Gulf War. - Come on Nigel. You know I'm right. You Brits were underpaid, undersexed. - Urgh! - And under Schwartzkopf. (Nigel grunts) (fist thuds) - Come along Nigel, you can do it. - All right, at ease corporal. Dillon. - This how you get your jollies? Setting up bar room fights. - It makes cheap entertainment. And it's a quick way to test if your wounds have healed. To the victor go the spoils. We have a situation that requires your expertise Dillon. - I'm retired. Thanks for thinking of me. - Retired. Oh that is a pity. I'm afraid Nigel and his friends will be compelled to escort you back to prison. - You're not a nice man. (ominous music) - Senator, I understand you've been in this situation before. What are we going to do? - Just do as they say, don't provoke them. - I said no talking! Open your mouth one more time, Mr. Cowboy Senator, and you're history. Do you understand? - Yeah. - You have no right. I am a member of a democratically elected government. - While you dine in five star hotels, how many kids go to bed hungry in your precious democracy? - Hypocrite! You are nothing. Just animals. - We're animals. (woman shrieks) - What do you want? - You sit down or I will decorate the walls with your brain. - Good. Go ahead. Shoot us all. Then what? - Yes. The senator's right. The two capitalist can't decide which one wants to die first. I shed a tear. - Pigs! (people screaming) (gunfire banging) (woman sobbing) - Leave him alone! I said, get away from him. (body thuds) - Joplin Hardy of the United States, Zula Nembe of the Gold Coast, now killed. And of course Sir Reginald Welland. When we've dealt with Sir Reginald, then we head to Washington DC. - Why Washington? - Because there's been a huge transfer of funds to a bank in Georgetown. - From? - From one of the Protocol accounts that we have been able to salvage. - I don't suppose I have time to shave. - Oh yes, of course you will, at 35,000 feet. Our plane leaves Heathrow within the hour. (foreboding music) - Condemning the Montreal conference as a plot by the leading industrial powers to freely pollute and exhaust the Third World of its natural resources, the self-proclaimed eco-terrorists have ruthlessly executed two hostages and threatened to kill the remaining captives, those include United States senator Joplin Hardy and Britain's Sir Reginald Welland... - Excuse me, my name is Catherine Dirk and I work for Senator Hardy. He's one of the hostages. Can I speak to the person in charge please? - No, no personnel media. - No, I'm not with the media, I work- (Sean speaks French) - Got any credentials. - Where am I supposed to get credentials. - Thank you. In that trailer right there, you're going to find half a dozen state department types, they'll be happy to stamp your wrist. - Thank you. - Yeah. (cellphone ringing) - It's about goddamn time. I hope to hell you're gonna tell me what I want to hear. - The document's being prepared as we speak. Between you and me, getting seven world leaders to agree on a unified statement, well it's going to be a bit of a problem. We're going to need a little more time on this. - Well, I've got problems too, but my problems accumulate on sidewalk and they fucking bleed. - You've got one hour. - Well? - Colonel Nettles. - Yes. - I can assure you that we've drawn up a solid plan here. - For Christ's sake! There's a future president of the United States in that building there. - And let me remind you that we're on Canadian soil. - Look, you know, there is another way. - Shut up. - I mean it. I'm the one you want. Why don't you let the others go? - What do you think? - You saw the floor plan. They've sealed themselves up in there with no escape route. - So it's a suicide mission. - That's what I'm afraid of. - Good luck! - I'll negotiate for you, safe passage. Anywhere you want. - Shut up. (suspenseful music) - We're not going in there until we know exactly what we're up against. You got that? (glass crashing) (suspenseful music) - Hey! (dart gun thuds) - [Woman] We are going to die. - Will you shut up! She's driving me up the fucking wall. (woman moans) (suspenseful music continues) Go check the window. (woman moaning) I'll decide who becomes a martyr in here. - [Woman] No! (woman sobbing) (dart gun thuds) (woman moaning) - You drop one more tear and I drop you. Now shut up! (woman sobs) (alarm blaring) (woman shrieks) - What the hell is that? Take it out! (dramatic tense music) - Go! Go! (gunfire clattering) - What the hell is going on? - Do it! - It wasn't supposed to happen this way. - Do it now! (gunfire clattering) (people yelling) (gunfire clattering) - It's over Senator. It's over. - Freeze! - Freeze! - Freeze. - Hold it! Hold it! Hold your fire it's over. - Whole area secure. - Are you all right? Are you all right? - Area secure captain. (woman shouting) - It's over sir. Senator I'll take that gun. Get you out of here. (woman shouting) (woman sobbing) - I'll take you outside. Get an ambulance up here. - Poor old Reginald. I shall miss him. - Something's not right, Charles. - You gotta stay behind the line. - Senator! - You get behind the line. - Can you tell us what happened? - Well we witnessed a terrible tragedy here. That's what happened. - And can you confirm you risked your own life to save the others? - The truth is they scared the hell out of me and I just, I reacted, I did what anybody would do. But I want the people behind this heinous crime to know that their violence has only served to strengthen my resolve- - The senator's involved in this Charles. - From now on Joplin Hardy will double his efforts to pursue the peaceful goals of this conference. (journalists clamoring) - Let's get out of here. - You should interrogate those two men they brought out. - No, forget it Dillon. First thing that we have to do is to get away from here before the Canadians start piecing things together, as well as which we have a plane to catch. (foreboding music) (door bell rings) - It's good to see you again Charles. I heard about Sir Reginald. - Yes. - Let me take you downstairs. Lenny? Lenny you here? (mumbled yelling) The Brigadier is here. - Ah! Just get my clothes. Get my clothes! Hello, sir. I woke up in the middle of the night and then started worrying and then forgot all about the time. You know how that can be. How was your flight? - Hm mm. - Good. Good. It's really nice to see you again. - Good to see you again truly. Yes well, Lenora Rubin- - It's Lenny sir. - And this is Jack McCarthy. - Excuse me. - You mean the infamous Sean Dillon? - Now you have been briefed on the Protocol accounts. - Yes, sir. - Right. Well, I must be off. I have the jolly task of explaining the Montreal fiasco to MI-5. And where do you think you're going? - I'm going to check into a hotel. - This is your hotel. - You're kidding. You want me to stay here and work with this kid? - Nice! - This kid has an IQ considerably higher than yours. So get to work. - My new man at the state department has been keeping his ears peeled, but he's heard nothing. - And your contacts at Mossad? - Playing their cards close until we give them something they don't already know. Is that why you brought him? - You don't approve? - A mercenary? I don't trust my back to a man who doesn't believe in a cause. - Mish, the Nazis believed in a cause. I suspect that Dillon believes in more than he will ever admit to. - How powerful is that computer. - Betty can find out what you ate for breakfast, so long as you used a credit card. - Why don't you ask Betty what Joplin Hardy had for breakfast and where he takes target practice. - Must you smoke? - It's in my contract. - Oh! - So. You want something in three buttons? - Mish, I don't believe that I can afford your level of quality. (Misha chuckles) Well, I'm off to London for a couple of days. Keep an eye on Dillon for me. - Perhaps you didn't hear the Brigadier but we're supposed to be tracking Protocol- - Joplin Hardy. (foreboding music) And I want a hard copy. I'm allergic to video screens. - Well, I'm not sure how to tell you this exactly, but Anson tells me that the president wants to hand me the vacancy at interior. - A cabinet post? - That's the terrible rumor. - Joplin, that's wonderful. Oh sweetheart that's wonderful. - How about that? There's a catch, it's not a slam dunk yet. A potential problem. - What is it? - Well, there's some Bible thumper over in the president's office who's been asking questions about my personal life. - Me. - Us, we. Well, there are voters out there Catherine, who would say that what we're doing is living in sin. It's an election year. The president has to watch his ass. - You know what that means? I'm not going to the house anymore. - It doesn't have to mean that. We could make it official. - Are you proposing to me? - Well, I just- (telephone rings) Hold that thought. Hold that thought. Yes. I'll hold. It's the president. What do you say? Let's get married. He'll be the best man. I love you. - Yes, yes, yes Joplin Hardy I will marry you. - Yes, yes. Yeah. Yes, sir. Mr. President. It is. - Hardy's a died in the wool liberal. ACLU, Amnesty International, Sierra Club. Elected to senate by a landslide. His first time at bat. - Landslides don't come cheap. Who are his backers? - The people. Hardy has the Midas touch when it comes to fundraising. See for yourself, it's all in the file. (Sean sighs) - That's quite a feat. Raising all that money 12 months after coming back from a USAID mission in Panama. Could you put together a list of the people that work with Hardy down there for me, give me the current addresses. - That'll take some time. - You got somewhere to go. - It's an unpalatable fact, sir, but it seems that the Duke isn't the only member of nobility to be named in the Windsor Protocol. There's Sir Reginald's father, Lord Welland. Apparently he donated a huge fortune in pound sterling to the Reich. - It's a miracle we ever won that war. Go on. - Well, three months ago, when the Protocol resurfaced, they secretly contacted Sir Reginald and they threatened to make that donation public. - Blackmail. - Sir Reginald came to us immediately and I asked him if he would play along so that we could learn more about these people. - Brave man. - Everything was going along very well until Montreal. And then his cover was blown. We had put extra security around him, but- - Tell me, do you have any idea how much is in this secret Nazi war chest? - As we estimate it sir, almost certainly billions. (dramatic music) (computer beeping) - You know, you should come talk to my field class sometime. - Oh yeah. - You fit the field agent profile to a T. - Tell me. - You smoke, you drink. Pretty self-destructive nature. Relationship to you is a bad word. You see women as objects, right? You wouldn't give a woman a second glance unless she was wearing stilettos and a pushup bra. - You got me. - Yeah. - Mm. (computer beeping) - Okay, a live one this time. Altina Morales. You'll like this one. She runs an exotic dance club called the Pair a Dice. What are you doing? - Well, I think it's time to check out somebody with stiletto heels and a push-up bra.

Keep the change. - George you just made my day. - Anything I could do for you, George. - As a matter of fact, there is, I got something here that I think Altina's gonna be interested in. - Altina who? - Altina, Altina, the woman who owns this place.

See my business takes me all through central America, South America, you know? - Go on. - I was in Panama and some friends of yours who knew you from your Joplin Hardy days suggested I stop on by. - I never heard of Joplin Hardy. - Really? Joplin Hardy the Senator. - Mr. Jorgensen I've never been to Panama in my life. I think you just wasted a trip. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - I do believe this meeting's over. - Yeah, I was just leaving. Oh. You know where I can get my change back? What about the 100 bucks? I guess not. - Now you're catching on. I don't want you to come back to this club. You hear me? I want you to forget you ever came to this club. (bodyguard grunts) (ominous music) - Thanks for the advice. I want You to set up a meeting with me and Hardy. - Certainly I'll just call up Capitol Hill and have his secretary pencil you in. - Yeah, I assume you can pipe into Canadian government computers. - Yeah. - Well, Hardy was such a hero. He deserves an official handshake from Ottawa. You speak Canadian eh? - What? - It is my overwhelming honor to induct you into Canada's Order of Valor. There you go. - That's beautiful. Isn't that? That's my honor. - Oh no, the honor is ours. May I? - Please yes. - Let me put it on you there. Make sure to get plenty of these Louise. - Does it go with the tie? - There. - Very nice. - May I Senator? Do me the honor. Okay. - My pleasure. - Okay. I think we have a keeper. - Good. - Thank you. - All right. You like those? - Oh you got quite a collection Senator. - Well that's, this is Panama city during the Just Cause operation. When Noriega's guys came in and tried to take over this building, I was in it. Lucky to escape. - Just like Montreal? - A lot like Montreal. Lucky to be alive. - [Secretary] Senator. Vice president powers on line one. - Mr. Cam, you'll have to excuse me. - Oh no. You've been more than generous with your time Senator. Thank you so much. - Good. - Okay then. And of course the Prime Minister of Canada thanks you. - Well I thank him. - Right? You wear that medal with pride now. - I will. - Okay. I'll just see myself out. - Do that. - Great. Say do you want me to close the door behind me then? - Please. - Yeah. Okay then. Right. Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye. - Geez. You ever hear anybody say so many thank yous? - Thank you. - Montreal. - Proper credentials. How are you? - Catherine Dergen, Senator Hardy's assistant. - Yes, Neil Cameron. - I'm fine. - I was just in to see your man on behalf of the Prime Minister. - I want you to look into him. I want to know who he is, exactly what he does. Just to be on the safe side. - Yes, sir. - [Joplin] Something fishy about that guy. - So he's in very good spirits, considering. - Yes. Joplin's a very strong man. - Yes, he must be. A friend of mine went through a similar incident in the middle East about a year ago. Took him quite a while to recover. - Really? - Yeah. - Well I know that he's been talking to a doctor friend. - Has he been? Oh that's good. And you? How are things going with you? It must be difficult being so personally involved as you are. - (laughs) Is it that obvious? - Oh it certainly was in Montreal. So how do you come to work for the Senator eh? - Actually, I used to work for Anson Powers. - Oh the vice president. - That's right. And after Joplin's assistant died. Anson was kind enough to recommend me for the job. - Miss Dergen. - Yes. - The senator would like to see you. - I'll be right there. - Well, thanks. - Thank you. - All right. Thank you. (foreboding music) - Sir the Canadian, he's across the street. - [Joplin] What are you going to do about it? - Have him arrested. - He hasn't done anything yet. - Not a problem. Reel him in. (sirens blaring) - [Sean] What's the problem officer? - It's against the law to drive with a disabled headlight. - Oh, they were fine, last time I looked. - License and registration. - Sure. There you go. - Can you step out of the car, Mr. McCarthy. - Sure. Now which headlight is disabled? (glass crashing) - That one. - Hands up against the car. You're under arrest. - What for? - Resisting arrest. (policeman grunts) (tense music) - FBI! Hold it! (punch thuds) - I'd really appreciate it if you knocked the next time. - Don't worry Lenora. You're safe with me. You don't get out a lot do you? - Well, we can't all be out shooting people or beating them up like you Dillon. - What would you do if there weren't any computers in the world? - I'd build one. - Two messages in my email box, including one from Rodolfo. He lives in Milan and he wants to have my children. - This your internet boyfriend? - Mm hm. Jealous? - Yeah. I hate to burst your bubble, but Rudolfo's probably some old fat balding guy from Budapest with bad breath and hemorrhoids. - Don't you have a machine gun to clean or something? - Where's Dillon? Dillon. Rumor has it that you paid an impromptu visit to Senator Hardy and then beat up a policeman on the way home. - Yep. - What? - Ferguson, you ever hear of a guy named Peter Pruitt? - Don't you try and change the subject? - He heads up an ultra conservative think tank with ties to every major reactionary movement in North America. - So what? - Tell him Len. - During the last election, the Pruitt Foundation made substantial contributions to Senator Hardy's campaign and... - Oh dammit Dillon, what's the bloody Pruitt Foundation got to do with the Protocol? - She's trying to tell you. - Right after he received a phone call from Pruitt Hardy canceled a very important fundraiser in LA to go to the conference in Montreal and well, sir, it gets better. If you'd like to come over here I'll show you on the screen. Betty was able to trail one of the Protocol accounts. Now it started off in Brazil, passed through Argentina made a hard left to Hong Kong then cruised to the front steps of the Pruitt Foundation. - Who then deposited $450,000 into a branch in Montreal, which was withdrawn about a week before the terrorist attack. Ferguson, what do think it cost to finance that attack in Montreal? - $450,000. Give or take a few bob. - Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm going to pay a visit to that Pruitt guy. - Absolutely not. Now, how about my accent, is it convincing Herr Ruben? - Herr Reuben, the Swiss Dutch, they roll the vowels and the back of the tongue. - Herr Reuben. - Now you have it. Sort of. (foreboding music) - So exactly why did you bring this to me, Mr... - For 30 years, I am an employee of the Zurich National Bank. And in one day, I am replaced by a program, by a machine. - This Windsor Protocol, whatever you call it. Why do you think I'd be interested? - Herr Pruitt, my sympathies lie alongside with yours. I am sure that you and your associates have heard of the Protocol accounts. For those of us who dream of the revival of the Reich, this is like being offered Jason's golden fleece. - If you have access to all this wealth then why come to me? - Better that the money is used by the kameraden werken. It is too late for me to spend it all on myself. And I am sure that your associates would not object to my joining with you after such a show of good faith. - I haven't a clue what you're talking about. - Whatever you say Herr Pruitt. Bitte. I have lived too long and planned too well, to leave anything to chances. My attorney has a sealed envelope with detailings of everywhere that I am and whom I am seeing. You have precisely two hours to consider my offer. Aufwiedesehen, Herr Pruitt. (suspenseful music) (camera clicking) - I told you never to come here during daylight. - This couldn't wait Mr. Greenfield. I was handed this by a Swiss banker, less than half an hour ago. These account numbers are from Windsor Protocol. The documents Hitler gave Bollen himself. Bank deposits around the world for us to draw. Do you realize what this means? We can finally put the machine back in order. - To fall for such a school boys trick. - You think these numbers are fake? - I have no doubt as to their authenticity. - Then why aren't you pleased? - Because you imbecile, I don't enjoy the thought of abandoning this house, my garden. - I'm not following you. - Where do you think I got the money that flows through your foundation? - You already have the Protocol. Then what's the problem. - The problem? The problem is, that the man who gave you this document is most probably a British spy. (tense dramatic music) And most likely had you followed here. - Are you sure? Mr. Greenfield, I'm sorry. I didn't think. - Yes. A glaring trait of yours. - How am I supposed to know all these things if you don't tell me anything? I'm just a stockbroker. - If humble beginnings were an excuse for failure, the fuhrer would have remained a house painter. Did you at least have the presence of mind to have the man followed. - Absolutely. Mr. Greenfield. Otto tails anyone suspicious. - Tell Otto you never want to see this man again. - Yes sir. - I haven't waited 55 years to let the British derail our plans a second time. And contact your doctor friend at the country club. Tell him to carry out his instructions immediately. It's time to make our move on the vice president. - Yes Mr. Greenfield. - Now get out. (suspenseful music) (stick tapping) (Mr. Greenfield humming) (Mr. Greenfield chuckling) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (gunfire clattering) (baby crying) - Help us here, call 911. - Oh my God! - Help us here. - We need help here. (baby crying) Somebody help us. - 315 Cherry Street. - Who's he? - Harry Houdini. - While you were gone, I found out where all those people with connections to the Senator are hiding. In the obituaries. Welcome to Joplin Hardy's wall of death. John Clark, you already know about. Jane Benton, Hardy's previous assistant, died in a car crash. Matt Levine headed up a committee that was looking into financial irregularities during the last election. Telephone activated car bomb. And those two terrorists you left alive in Montreal. They started talking. Turns out they have connections to a neo-fascist movement in Quebec. They're claiming it was all a setup. (telephone ringing) Ruben's Tailors. Yes. Mr. Ambassador. What? Mercy General. Yes, sir. It's the Brigadier, he's been shot. He's in a coma. - Find out what you can about this guy. (somber music) Pruitt and Hardy are dancing with the same devil Charles. I know you can hear me. Word is, non comatose patients get the hottest nurses. Well, I enjoyed our talk. You old goat. - Joey. - Why isn't the president making the announcement himself? - Because he has an important golf game with the Japanese prime minister. (all laugh) (coughing) But in all seriousness I want to thank the president for allowing me the honor to make this announcement personally. I am especially pleased because I feel an enormous amount of pride when it comes to this man. I have known Joplin Hardy for practically all his political life. Some say that goes all the way back to the cradle. (laughs) (coughing) Congratulations Joplin on your appointment as Secretary of the Interior. You have been a true friend, a loyal supporter and a true fighter. And I hope your job isn't as bumpy as your nomination process. And I feel confident that you will enjoy much success. - Anson? Anson. Doctor, is there a doctor? - Clear the way. - Anson? Can you breathe? Relax, can you hear me. Give him some space. Give him some room. Clear away. - We need the medic. - Call my office right away, tell them what happened. Tell them I'm on my way to the hospital. - You got a call sir. The stationery's ready. - God! - The oxygen masks. - Back. (people clamoring) (foreboding music) - Thanks very much. Have a good day. Yes sir. May I be of service? - I'm looking for a special type of vellum. - We have a wide selection in the storeroom. Would you care to take a look? - Yes. - Follow me please. - Brigadier? - He'll be all right. How about the old guy on Cherry Street? - He goes by the name of Albert Greenfield. I don't know, he doesn't strike me as particularly sinister but I've been morphing his features back to what he must've looked like during the war. Until now, Betty hasn't been able to make a match with any known Nazi. - Chase the Protocol accounts, I'm going to play a visit to our friend on Cherry Street. - I'd hold that thought. I just picked a call from DC police. Greenfield's house burned down an hour ago. - What? (dramatic music) - This agent is unpredictable and that makes him dangerous. Especially since he has been talking to your fiance. - I made a mistake that's all. - It's only a matter of time before he finds this place. - Well, what do you suggest? Because I've got to get over to the hospital. I should be at Anson's side right now. - I called you here to warn you of some last minute adjustments to our plans. - I don't like it when you say "adjustments". - The president will be reluctant to appoint an immediate successor to Powers while he's still alive. - That's no problem. We just have the doctors insist that Anson resign. Too much stress. - Time is a luxury we can no longer afford. We must facilitate the president's hand. Leave him in no doubt about Power's condition. - The president likes me. I've got that area covered and Anson, I'll remind you, is my friend. - I made it clear from the outset that I will not allow personal attachments to interfere with our plans, which is why I'm also of the opinion that marrying the girl is not the best course. - There's no need to delay my wedding. - I mean cancel it permanently. - Catherine knows nothing about us. - Are you positive? Did you ever plan on telling her about us? Hmm? You haven't thought this through very carefully have you, Mr. Secretary? The fact is Catherine is your weakest link. That makes her my biggest headache. - That's bullshit. - I will not jeopardize the operation on account of some lovelorn fraulein. The issue has been decided. She will be dealt with. - Dealt with? - And so will Powers. The sympathy factor will play to our advantage. - Have you seen my approval ratings lately? Because I don't need you. You need me. Without me, you can kiss the fourth Reich goodbye. - (chuckles) You're absolutely right, but it is also important to bear in mind that approval ratings can fall as fast as they rise. Isn't that so Miss Morales? - Well, well, well. It's been a long time Joplin. - Altina has kindly decided to join us here, as a friendly reminder of the agreement we struck in Panama. In conclusion, Mr. Secretary, I strongly recommends that you never threaten me again. I put you into that cabinet and I can rip you out of it. Just like your predecessor. - When? - I expect a change in Mr. Power's status before morning. So I suggest to go to the hospital and be at his side. It will play beautifully for the cameras. - Don't think I'll be making that next tee off time. - You should have skipped the last one. I won 20 bucks. You'll be back Anson, you've got mountain cider in those veins. (melancholy music) - You know, I know you might not think much of the Brigadier but he really is a good man. - Yeah he is. - When I was just a kid my parents died. Right? So he brought me over from London to live with Uncle Mish. Arranged for my scholarship. He saved my life. (somber music) - See you in the morning. Well, well, what have we here? - Looks like you have an intruder. - Should I call security. - Only if you think you're gonna need any help. - No no, I think I can handle this one. unfortunately not right away. I need you to revert back to being my office assistant for a while. - Tonight? - Yes. Tonight. I'm sorry. I'm stuck. White House wants me back there in the morning. Another security check. - Who is it this time? - Chief of staff, seems to think that anybody who ever set foot in Panama is a drug dealer. You mind digging up those old aid mission files. - Sure. - Thank you. You're a doll and I'm sorry. So Cath, that Canadian guy you were talking to. What was that all about? - Cameron? - Hm mm. - I don't remember. - You don't remember? - Well no, I just recognized him from Montreal and we didn't really talk about anything special. Why? - Well I had Bob run a check on him. It turns out there's nobody by that name at the prime minister's office. Nobody even in the Canadian government and to top it off my computer files have been breached. - What? You think someone across the Senate floor is trying to block your nomination. - It could be. - You're not keeping anything from me are you? Something I should know about? - No. And I'm sorry to be bringing this stuff up. - Hm mm. Aid mission files. - Aid mission files. Yes. - And some coffee. - Coffee. Coffee. Excellent, thank you. You're an angel. - Then you should let me take off my halo sometime. - Yes. Yes. Take off whatever you like. (tense dramatic music) Gemma. You all right? Hi kids. Doctor. Hey mind if I play through? - I spoke to the president. It's been decided. You're his choice. (Anson sighs) - Cancel all his appointments. Make sure to send flowers to the vice president's room. Thank you. - You! You open that door before I call for help. - I'm not going to hurt you. - What do you want? - I want you to answer me a question. Did you tell Hardy you and I met in Montreal? - Of course. - Catherine my name is Sean Dillon. I'm an agent of the British government. I'm here investigating the Montreal kidnapping. - You know, you're a very good liar, Mr er Dillon. Cameron, whoever you are, but you're not fooling me. - Your life is in danger. - And you're out to ruin Joplin's career. - Your boss is involved with some very dangerous people who won't hesitate to kill anybody who gets in their way. - You are out of your mind. - Look. This is a file of people that used to work with Hardy. Jane Bentham, his last assistant. Matt Levine. They're all dead. (foreboding music) What happened to Anson Powers was no accident. - You make me sick. - Catherine. (knocking on door) - [Guard] Who's in there. - Be careful. No one is safe. - Miss Dirgen, is there anything wrong? - No the door must've been jammed. - I heard voices. - It's only me. - Are those your papers on the floor there ma'am? - Yes. Thank you. I'll get them. (foreboding music) (computer beeping) - Well say hello to Gerhart Heinzer, circa 1944. - Nice work. - Heinzer was SS. Bastard delivered Himmler's production quotas to Auschwitz and the other factories of the Third Reich. That son of a bitch has more than 250,000 death warrants on his hands. - Oh. Better find him Lenny, before he finds us. (tense music) (explosion bangs) (glass shatters) - Uncle Misha! - Lenny! - Uncle Misha! Misha! (explosion booms) (Lenny screams) (explosion bangs) - Come on! (explosion booms) Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go. (Lenny sobbing) All right. No! No! Lenny come on. We gotta get out of here. Stay down! Stay down! (Lenny sobbing) We'll get them. Lenny I need your help. we gotta get out of here before the cops get here, you hear me? Look at me. Do you have keys for this? Can you help me? Yeah. - Okay. Keys, keys. Keys. Okay. This is how it started in the 30s, bombs, burning books, dragging people away in the middle of the night. - All the files have been destroyed. You got no backup. - You want backup. I'll give you backup. - What's this? - Hold this. This is my backup. This is a computer, that's a modem. - Lenny, Lenny I don't give you enough credit. - There we go. Albert Greenfield is something of a chameleon. Owned a stationary store here in Washington under the name John Strauss. 10 years ago, he sold it to a shop manager. Then moved to Canada. A few years later he rematerialized as Albert Greenfield again here in Washington. - Know where this is? - Yeah. Yeah. I know a shortcut. (tense music) Do you think he's in there? - One way to find out. - Looks pretty harmless enough to me. - Okay. All right there. Oh! Partner what do you got there? - Someone has to cover your back. I know how to use a gun Dillon. - I'm sure you do. Lenny. This is not a field class. - Oh, come on. I'm not just gonna sit here. - Yes you are. If I'm not back in 15 minutes, create a diversion. - A diversion? - Hm mm. - What sort of a diversion? - Make something up. - Make something up. Okay I'll make something up. - I'm sorry, but we're closed. - It'll just take a minute. It'll only take a minute. Listen I'm looking for something in a light bond in lavender. - Come back tomorrow. - It's for my Aunt Lucille. Poor woman's confined to a wheelchair. Her last joy in life is writing letters. - I'm sorry. We don't have anything in lavender. - Her eyesight is failing. Off lavender would be fine. - I'll have to check in the back. - Oh, thanks you're a godsend. (suspenseful music) - You've got to go. (gunshot bangs) (suspenseful music) - 15 minutes. 15 minutes. 15 minutes. Okay. Okay. (tense music) - Impressive timing, Mr. Dillon. Thanks to you I have another moving day to look forward to. - Turn off the machine. Hands where I can see them. - Please excuse the mess, but as you can see- - Drop the gun. - I was expecting your company. (fist thuds) - Oh. - Whom I diverting? Who? What the f... - It must appear it was intended for him. Make certain she is in the car before you ring the number understand. - Yes sir. (suspenseful music) - Why waste your skills serving the British? - Brits ain't so bad. They do have a national health. What do you got? - Don't mistake me for a senile old fool. In a few minutes you are going to wish you never met me. The truth is you don't stand for anything and you amount to nothing. It will give me great pleasure to see your ashes swept into the gutter along with the rest of the mongrel garbage. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And for your information. I never overlooked the details, including the young Jew, parked outside. Ja. (tense music) - [Radio Announcer] Tonight in Washington, it is now official. Dr. Harold Fleck delivered the news just moments ago. Vice president Anson Powers has died on the operating table. - Fleck is a detail you seem to have overlooked. - [Announcer] Friend of the Powers family was at the hospital at the time of the announcement. Sources at the White House say that Senator Hardy has already been asked to succeed Vice President Powers. The Senator and Dr. Fleck are scheduled to hold a press conference in the next half hour. (Greenfield chuckling) - So Hardy in the white house. I don't know Heinzer, you got a lot of loose ends. You got Fleck, Pruitt, Altina Moralis, Catherine Dergan. - None of them traceable back to me. As you can see, I prefer to conduct my transactions the old fashioned way. (machine whirrs) - I'll call you. All right. You'll take care of them. Right buddy. - Mister Secretary. - Not right now. - Please a comment. - Thank you. I'm sorry. A little later. Thank you. Catherine. Bit of a circus down here, right now. It would break your heart if you saw the family. Well, now I find out that the president wants me to replace Anson. I need you with me for sure. Meet me at the press conference in half an hour. Half an hour. (suspenseful music) - Ah! Does this look familiar? The one and only copy of the Windsor Protocol. Maybe not. They were all mostly burnt when you got to them. Weren't they? At any rate I don't think I'll be shredding this. (suspenseful music continues) - Ah! (gasps) - The young Jew stumbles to the rescue. (doorbell rings) - Jenkin? Hello. Anybody here. Mr. Jenkin are you here? Hello. Mr. Jenkin are you there. - I'm very sorry, sir. But you know what? We're closed. (tense music) - [Customer] You're new here. - Yes I am sir, I'm brand new. It's my first day, it's my first shift. - I know you're closed but Mr. Jenkin usually bends the rules a little bit for me. - Um. Uh, do you have your receipt? - Oh, lost it. But look don't worry. - [Lenny] I can't find it if you don't have a receipt. - Oh in heavens! It's pink with floral patterns. For my daughter's birthday. My wife is gonna kill me if I don't come home with this. - I don't know. I'm really not supposed to look for anything without Mr. Jenkins. - Okay. Here's my card. I'm James K. Smith with the FBI. - [Lenny] Mr. Smith. - If I run out on you, you know where to find me? - Sure. Mr. Smith. You stay here and I'll be right back. (grunting) - (whispering inaudibly) is killing people. (grunting) - [Customer] Any luck? - I'm looking sir, but I don't see any pink floral patterns. - Okay. Well look, I'll just come in and give you- - No! I'm very sorry sir. No, employees only sir. Very sorry. - [Customer] Can't miss it. - Pink floral pattern. Pink, pink, floral pattern. - Is she blind. - Pink, pink, pink. - Tell her where the damn thing is. Last shelf, top right, red bin. Do you really want the FBI to find out where that body is? - Come on. Pink floral, pink, pink. - [Sean] Lenny. - What? - [Sean] Last shelf, top right, red bin. - I'll just join you. - Ah! Ah! (shelf crashes) (tense music) - I found it, sir. - Should I pay you now or- - Later. I mean, I mean later. Okay. (laughs nervously) (gunshot bangs) Dillon! Dillon! - I said a diversion, not a one act play. - This is Heinzer. - Yeah. Not much to look at is he? - You son of a bitch. - Go ahead Jude. What are you waiting for? I had your uncle killed. Do it! Do it! - I can't. - Not as easy as punching the computer keyboard is it? - Fate demands that you kill me Dillon. - Shut up. - I will not be exhibited at some glass cage. I know all the names of the Protocol by heart. I will bring down your government with me. And the Americans. - You know. He's got a point. Knock yourself out. Let's go. - Letting him off so easy. - I'm saving a bullet. You got five minutes Heinzer. The cops will put you in any cage they want. - So what now? - Hardy's, fast as you can. (tense music) (ominous music) (phone rings) - Pick it up. Pick it up! Come on pick it up. (phone rings) (dramatic music) Catherine, stop! Stop! - Get off the car! - Stop! Get out of the car! (Catherine screaming) Come on! - What do you want from me? Who are you? - I'm Lenny. - Dial Joplin's car phone. - What? - Dial his car phone. (phone dialing) (explosion booming) - Oh! (phone ringing) (Catherine gasps) - Yeah. - Are you still alive Dillon? - Yeah, well, the night is young Ferguson. (Lenny laughs) You have a nice nap. - I'm just, I'm sorry. - For a while there, I thought you might be attending my funeral. Do you have the Protocol? - Yeah, tucked safely in my jacket. - And Heinzer. - Ashes to ashes. - Bring it to me at once. - Yeah. I just got to take care of one last thing. (Catherine sobs) It's all right. It's all right. - He tried to kill me. - Upon attempting to clear the obstruction of his aortic valve, the vice president went into trauma. - [Reporter] Doctor. - I'm afraid his heart just gave out. - Dr. Fleck, to what do you attribute Mr. Powers deteriorated heart condition? - I can't say with certainty. Anson seemed healthy as a horse. But of course he had an appetite to match. I had tried to counsel him about his appetite. - Doctor I have a question please. - What is it Senator? - If called by the president will you serve? - No more questions. Senator Hardy has just been given some terrible news. - Senator? Doctor? - Washington police report that Senator Hardy's fiance Catherine Dergin has been killed in a car bomb explosion. - Do you think it was meant for you Senator? - Is it the same group that tried to kill you in Montreal? - That's it! That's enough. - Senator Hardy your reaction. - Please, this is not the time. - There are sick minds in this country that would stop at nothing to silence me and what I stand for which is a voice of compassion for the common man. And you ask if I would serve, try to stop me now. Catherine. I wanted to serve my country, you know that. I laundered money to do it. Panama. You think you're going there to work for peace and you end up selling arms to torturers and dictators. And then we decide we want to support a democracy there again and I'm the bad guy. I'm out! They bought me Catherine. What could I do? They bought me a Senate seat, wanted to make me president. - [Man] Get down! - I'm sorry Catherine. - Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon. (gunshot bangs) (Catherine screams) (somber music) - Her majesty's government will be forever in your debt Charles. With these documents we can finally lay to rest that wretched war. And now Charles, I want you to bear witness to what I'm about to do. Her Majesty asked me to convey her thanks to your man for a job well done. (melancholic music) - You all right? - I'll be fine. I wanted to thank you for saving my life, in person. All I'm supposed to say right now is that Joplin had some psychiatric problems. - I'm sorry it had to happen this way Catherine. - There's so much I didn't see. - You loved him. - Yeah I did. And we were gonna be married. I'm probably never going to see you again either. - You never know. Come here. - I have something for you. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Now that we have the Protocol Account numbers I can't see anything to be gained by publicizing these names. Let not the sins of the fathers be visited on their sons. - To the airport Lenora. - Right away sir. Oh and sir, it's Lenny.
