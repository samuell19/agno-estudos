Congratulations. Take your last test out on the field. It's the most important one, and the toughest. Before you get your lawman's badge, you have to show us that you deserve it. Your destination is the Bronx, Southeast Sector. Keep in mind everything you've learned about the area. And remember, there can be danger at every street corner-- mortal danger. As for the rest of it, well, you'll have to find that out for yourself. Good luck, Crowley. [GUNSHOT] -[GROANS] -You're welcome, son. Come on over here. I've been expecting you. My name's Warren, but everybody just calls me The Black Man. You're James Crowley, right? -You guessed it. -It wasn't hard to do. There's a file on you. The Academy sent it to me. It included your picture. -I guess I should have thanked you. -If I were you, I'd hold off on that. You might find you feel more like cursing me for it. They didn't pick an easy assignment for you down here. Know anything about it? -Yes, more or less. To be a baby sister for some unusually defective machines. Right? -Wrong. -What do you mean? -I'll tell you. Those machines are androids and humanoids. Creatures made in our own image, sonny-- just that these ones were made badly. Factory seconds, you know? Classified useless. They're all in this area, and my job is to oversee them and try to keep their behavior more or less within the limits of the law. -With, uh, friendly persuasion? Or with force? -I use it all. The androids hate the humanoids, and guess what? The feeling is mutual. The hell of it is that they're the only ones who can tell each other apart. Anyway, they've divided the whole area up into two rival zones, and keeping the peace is getting to be a bigger problem all the time. The worst of them all is the head of the androids-- a girl named Margie. She's got power, and she'll cross your path pretty damn soon. You can count on it. But don't make the mistake of thinking all those machines are alike. Some of them need our help and our protection, and it's our business to see they get it. Remember, this whole territory depends on what we do and how we judge. Is that understood? -Understood. When do we begin? -As soon as you're ready, son. As soon as I decide you're ready. -Are you there, Shark? SHARK (OVER RADIO): Yeah, right here. MARGIE: I want to talk to you. -Anything important, Margie? -I found a base of a group of the humanoids. It's an old warehouse in Quadrant C2. I want you to push them towards the white rocks. I'll be there, welcoming them. -I'll go get busy, then. MARGIE: And remember, Shark, I don't want one of those scum left alive. -Right, as usual. MARGIE: Move. [BEEPING] [ENGINE REVS NON-SUBTLY] -Let's go! -Listen to me. We'll show those goons what we humanoids are made out of! You ready? -We're with you. -OK, let's go! -Divide up. We gotta find 'em. -Get 'em. Get 'em! [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] -By now, Shark should have flushed them out. Strange he isn't here yet. OUTSPOKEN FEMALE ANDROID: I think it's strange that you trust him. Why do you? -He's in love with me. And he hates the humanoids. OUTSPOKEN FEMALE ANDROID: Do you love him? -(SENSUOUSLY) I only love death. Other people's death, naturally. [GUNFIRE] -Look, Shark, c'mon, let's get outta here! [MORE GUNFIRE] -Don't let them get away! [MORE GUNFIRE] -That's Shark! Get to you places, quickly! -Kill them all! [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOTS] -Kill them all! [PANICKED SCREAMING IN DISTANCE] [GUNSHOTS] [SOUNDS OF HUMANOID DISTRESS CONTINUE] [GUNFIRE] -[CRIES OUT] [GUNFIRE] -Let's get out of here. -Fast! -Hurry up, man. -C'mon, move it! -Hurry up! -C'mon! [GUNFIRE] -Hurry up! -[DEATH GROAN] [HUMANOID DISTRESS AND GUNFIRE] -[CRIES OUT] -Hurry up, get out of the way! -Move it! [GUNFIRE] -Hurry up! -Get outta here!

Come on, come on! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] -[DEATH GROAN] [GUNFIRE] -[DEATH GROAN] [SPASTIC GUNFIRE] [CONTINUED GUNFIRE AND DEATH GROANS] [VERY PERSISTENT GUNFIRE] -[SLOW MOTION DEATH GROAN] -Dakar, Dakar! -[ROARS ANGRILY] -We ran into a trap, Dakar. They pushed us into the valley. -They're pigs! Let's get our people away. Let's get out of here. Move, let's go, go! -C'mon, get after them! Move it! Move! [MOTORCYCLES REV] -C'mon, move it, man! Go fast. [MORE DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GUNFIRE AND DEATH GROANS] -I gotta kill Margie! All my people are gonna be killed. She's a murderer! And she just hates us so damn much! (WITH PHILOSOPHICAL ANGST) Why? Where did it come from? Why is the only answer for us to kill them? [BLAST] [BLASTS AND DEATH GROANS] [HUMANOID SHOUTS OF PAINS] -Nearly there. I just hope we get to them in time. [GROANING] -Pull back. Quickly, Dakar's coming. -C'mon! -Don't hear anybody shooting anymore. -Ah, damn it. [GUNFIRE] -[CRY OF PAIN] -Quick-- [ENGINE REVS] -Back to the castle. -Right! [CRIES OF PAIN] [MOTORCYCLES REV TO LIFE] -Look, it's Shark. Get him! [GUNSHOTS] [MOURNFUL NATURE SOUNDS] -And they didn't have so much as a handgun among them. How could they do that? I have to find them. I'll find all of them and slaughter them! [RATTLING SOUNDS] -All right, you're telling me they're just defective machines. So wouldn't it be easier to destroy them at the source? -That was the order that was planned originally, but they hadn't reckoned with the politicians. And the scientists, who started throwing around terms like programmed genocide-- they said that since these androids and humanoids were different because of their flawed production, they had a right to a personality. Some even said a soul, and so could no longer be regarded as simply machines. The press had a field day with the story. And the public made such a fuss over it that the bosses backed down from their original ruling and let them live. -And so they just drop the wrecks here and wash their hands of it, right? -Yeah, they declared the area a national reservation. -Sounds like they took a page out of the history books and game them the same treatment they gave the Indians. -Pretty much, son, pretty much. Of course, they came up with a lot of fancy-sounding justifications-- oh, for instance, a behavior study, hoping for future recovery and use, things like that. So they sit back and submit those machines to all kinds of experiments in the name of progress, in the name of humanity. You get it? -What kind of experiments? -I'll show you. Once a week, a helicopter lowers a case of goodies like this-- looks good, eh? Delicious. Hell. Then they enjoy seeing the two groups fight over it-- what extent they're willing to go to, how many of them get killed in the fights. -And what part do we play in all this? --[CHUCKLES GRIMLY] In theory, our actions are limited to containing and keeping a lid on their skirmishes, so they don't all kill each other. -And in practice? -I already told you what the practice is, son. But here's what you don't know. There's somebody else involved, and he's transformed this into a battleground. I don't know who he is or who they are. -What for? What advantage are they going to get out of it? -Power, for example. Or the joy of killing. Both fundamental to human nature. -Not everyone's. -Well near enough. Anyway, we've got our work cut out for us. And son, there isn't anybody can change that. -I'm with you, Warren. -Good. They're gonna haul in more cases later today. I've been told about the hour and the place. Come and watch the show. -I'm ready. -OK. You'll probably run into Margie and Dakar at some point today. JAMES CROWLEY: I remember what you told me about Margie, but, um, who's this Dakar? WARREN: The head of the humanoids. He looks like a walking mountain. I've seen him beat twenty androids into a pulp. Obviously, enemy number one as far as Margie and her goon, Shark, are concerned. It sounds strange to say this about a machine, but there's something human about Dakar. I can't put my finger on it. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] -Gotta get the stuff before the androids come. Move out, go, go! -OK. -Right. PILOT: Chopper six to base, chopper six to base. We are at unloading point. What are your instructions, over. BASE (OVER RADIO): Base to chopper six. Begin unloading operations and remain in observation, over. JAMES CROWLEY: What's going to happen now? WARREN: Look and learn. We can watch it all do here being seen. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] -Don't let them get away. [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] PILOT: Chopper six to base. We're beginning unloading operations, over. BASE (OVER RADIO): Proceed, chopper six. Over. PILOT: Chopper six to base. Unloading operation has been effected. Group of humanoids approaching. Over. BASE (OVER RADIO): Base to chopper six. Regain observation altitude. Over. PILOT: Read you base. Out. -C'mon, pick up the stuff and get out of here! -Get as many as you can. [URGENT VOICES] HUMANOID: Let's get out of here! HUMANOID: Hurry up, get in the car! HUMANOID: Heads up, we got visitors! [ENGINES ROAR THREATENINGLY] [SHOUTING] -Watch out! [ENGINES ROARING AND BATS THUMPING] [THUMPS AND GROANS] [THUMPING AND GROANING] [CRIES OF PAIN] -[SCREAMS] -[CRY OF PAIN] -[GRUNTING AND MOANING] -Come on! Back to work! Hurry! -Just stay here and watch. -There's another one. -(WEAKLY) Please help me. I'm sick. -I know you, Black Man. [GRUNTING AND BLOWS LANDING] [SOUNDS OF FIGHTING] -[CHOKING] [ENGINE STARTS] -You didn't look like you needed anyone's help. -[CHUCKLES SLIGHTLY] -Where are the others? -They didn't make it. I'm the only one who got away. -You got your asses kicked by four lousy androids? There must have been ten of you. -The androids had nothing to do with it. -Then what the hell is it? -That Black Man. -I told you, you touch my sheriff-- you touch my sheriff, I'll kick your filthy ass! I'll draw you up, man, hear me? -Yes, Dakar. -I can't hear you! Louder! -(LOUDER) Yes, Dakar! -Louder. -(LOUDER STILL) Yes, Dakar! -Better. -What you saw out there was just a hint of what it can really be like. -Can I ask you a question, Warren? -Keep it to yourself, James. You don't survive with words around here. Take my advice. Quit while you're alive. -I want that sheriff's badge. I can't wait to start. -That big old badge ain't easy to get. You'll have to go through hell to get it. And from what I've seen of you, it looks like you'd melt on a warm day at the beach, son. -Show me. -[CHUCKLES] [FASTER-PACED MUSIC PLAYING] -You told me you wanted to try. C'mon, son. Move your ass. C'mon! Don't let them scare you. Faster! Do you want to stand there just thinking about it? I knew you wouldn't hack it. You want to try again? -Faster. -Faster, faster. Hell, son, you remind me of an apple hanging on a tree waiting to get picked. You couldn't earn a dog catcher's badge the way you're going. -[GRUNTS WITH EFFORT] [METALLIC CLANGING] -Trying to show me how slow a man can move? Forget it. Give it up! -(STRAINED) Never! -Then move. You don't start moving those hands, all you're going to have left are stubs. I've seen hopeless cases before, but you're something else, son. -Move. [BANG] -Move. [BANG] -Move. [BANG] -I swear to God, my Great Aunt Rachel could give you a lesson in this, and she's dead! [BANGING CONTINUES] -Move, move. Move. Don't just sit there. [CLANGING CONTINUES] -Having yourself a nice, comfortable time? Huh? Some people are lucky to get these paid vacations. [GRUNTING AND CLANGING] -Move, move, move! Now 40 chin-ups, double time. And keep your hands moving at the same time, lard ass, or this crowbar's gonna make sawdust out of your knuckles. -[YELLS] -Come on, son. -[GRUNTS] -I'll tell you this one more time, the last time. You're not cut out for this stuff. Go back home. That's what you should do. Go settle down. Get married. -[GRUNTS] -Can't afford to think about it. Just go. Your heart's so set on this little badge, show me you want it. Jump! -[GRUNTS] -OK, you got 10 seconds. Go. Faster, faster! Oh, boy, you'll never make it. Scrape the skin off your back, but move! Impossible. Go faster, boy. I don't care what happens. Now get your woman clothes off. You've gotta handle pistols. Here, you've got eight shots in there, and you've got to hit eight targets. Not seven, but eight. You miss one target-- one target, that's all-- and no more chances. You've had it. Ready? Turn around and start. [SHUTTERS CLICK] [GUNSHOTS] -All right, move away. You just gave up being a sheriff, son. There's no room for mistakes in this job. Goodbye, James. [GUN CLICKING] [SAD SAXOPHONE MUSIC] [CRASHES OFF-SCREEN] WARREN (VOICEOVER): Well, son, school's over. There's nothing more I can teach you. You did just fine, and I'm proud of you. Your reflexes are first rate, and you're in perfect shape. But what made me happiest was your will to win. I'm tired. Too tired and too old to take anymore. It's all yours, now. Well, son, now you're the law. The future of this territory depends on you and you alone. You can't afford to show mercy to the ruthless. But above all, you can't deny your help to anyone who needs it-- because anyone who trusts the laws to help him settle his differences deserves the best treatment the law can give him. There's good in many men, son, and that includes some machines made in the image of man. Don't forget it. Good luck, Sheriff Crowley. -I found all the survivors of the white rock massacre, except you. Ned told me you and Rover ran away. I found him, too-- dead. Did you get back there to your own people? I wonder. I'm not going to give in until I find you, safe. Nothing's going to stop me. I swear it. [WIND BLOWING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [FOOTFALLS] -Anything? -I've gone over every square inch of this place. I have to start looking in android territory. -Don't do it. -Ned, I can't rest until I know she's safe. -In that case, let me come too. -Forget it. This is one risk I'm going to have to take by myself. [FUNKY YET MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] NED (OVER RADIO): Please come in, Dakar. -Hello, Ned? Come in, please. NED (OVER RADIO): Turned the whole sector upside down-- looked in every possible hiding place, and about a thousand impossible ones. -Any news? NED (OVER RADIO): All we found is a bunch of our people, dead. Not a trace of the girl. -Keep on looking for her. NED (OVER RADIO): Dakar, we need you here. You've got to come back! -Shut up, Ned! NED (OVER RADIO): Listen to me. Let me tell you just one thing! -Ned, that girl's too important for me. NED (OVER RADIO): And you're too important for our people. We need you, and we need you alive. There's one other thing you've got to remember, Dakar. That girl is not for you. There isn't anything between the two of you. There can never be. Whatever you feel for her is just an illusion. You were made to be without feeling-- no cold, no heat, no love. You're here because something didn't work. You're a useless machine, a lemon, just like the rest of us. But a machine is what you are, and you can't afford to forget it. -Who cares? NED (OVER RADIO): What the hell do you mean by that? -I mean I love her, so I don't care. NED (OVER RADIO): You haven't listened to one damn word I said. -Don't push it, Ned. Of NED (OVER RADIO): You're a machine, damn it! -Right. One of flesh and blood, too. NED (OVER RADIO): I don't know what the hell else to say to you. -That's enough now. Don't push it too far. Talk to you in an hour. Out, Ned. NED (OVER RADIO): Right, Dakar. Out. -I haven't seen any blood in almost two days. And you know, I'm getting kinda uptight. -Ralph, I wish you'd just shut up for a while. -No way. No way. -Better you both do it, huh? -I don't take orders from you punks. Ask again. -We've got our tempers going this morning. -What are you waiting for? Go on, shoot. Isn't that what you want? Only I think it would be better if you took it out on that pig that killed our men, or on that good man, the sheriff. -That Black Man, you mean? -Sure. Him and his new deputy. -I'll get around to it. Right now, I'm enjoying this little game. [EMPTY GUN CLICKS] -Boom. [WOMAN LAUGHS] -You're just a pig. -Ned, can you hear me? NED (OVER RADIO): Loud and clear, Dakar. We're with you. -All right, let's hear a little progress report. NED (OVER RADIO): We haven't stopped searching for a minute. -Damn it, did you find her? NED (OVER RADIO): No, but there's some fresh footprints that might be hers. They head over towards the android territory. -(MUFFLED) Dakar! -No, it's not your big, strong Dakar. -Oh, what have we got here? You said you wanted some fun, Ralph. Show us what you can do with her. Go on. -Dakar! Dakar, help me! -You'll never want that cup of lard again once you've had me. [LAUGHS VICIOUSLY] -[WOMAN STRUGGLING] -Hold still. -[STRUGGLING AND CRYING] -No, no! [CRIES AND STRUGGLES] [CRYING AND STRUGGLING CONTINUES] [GUNSHOTS] [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] -Hello, Ned? Do you hear me? Come in. Do you hear me? NED (OVER RADIO): Yeah, I hear you, Dakar. What's going on there? I've been calling in for 15 minutes. Did you find her? -She was raped-- raped and killed. NED (OVER RADIO): Sorry, Dakar. What do you want us to do? -Get together and wait for my instructions. NED (OVER RADIO): What do you have in mind? -I can't explain right now. Just trust me and do what I tell you. Out. -Don't move. -Where's The Black Man? I want to talk to him. -Warren's gone forever. I'm taking his place. What did you want to ask? -I want help. -What kind of help? -The androids, and the androids' boss. Her name's Margie. They killed the woman I love. They killed her, only first they tortured her. It was a horrifying way to die. -Humanoids are made so that they don't feel a lot of pain. Don't worry too much. -She wasn't a humanoid. She was like you. -Then why did you tell me you loved her? A machine can't love a human being. -Why not? Don't you love your god? -Your battles are your own to settle between you. Nobody will care. I can't. WARREN (VOICEOVER): Well, son, now you're the law. The future of this territory depends on you and you alone. You can't afford to show mercy to the ruthless. But above all, you can't deny your help to anyone who needs it. Because anyone who trusts the law to help him settle his differences deserves the best treatment the law can give him. -I'm sorry, I'm ready to help you. But I'm warning you-- don't expect too much. It won't be easy to beat them. -I'll have all my people with me, just waiting for orders. -We need a plan that works. We can't afford to fail. -If you're with me, we can win. I'm ready to face all the androids in this world. Thanks, White Man. Can I call you that? -(OVER RADIO) Checkpoint three to base. Checkpoint three to base. Come in, base. Over. -Yeah, checkpoint three. Over. -(OVER RADIO) Situation is quiet here, base. Everything under control. No news of anything. No humanoids on the horizon, over. -I read you on that, checkpoint. It's a good report, out. -Shark here. Everything OK over there? Control room, come in, over. -Control room, Jones. Situation is normal here, shark. No activity of any kind. Over. -Keep your eyes open anyway. And move up the switch-on time of the castle's alarm system. I have a feeling something's going to happen, and I don't want us to get caught napping. Over. -Right away. I'll move up the timer by an hour. It'll be done in a minute. Over. -Let's have four or five guards added tonight. And I don't want them missing out on anything. Now the voltage switch. Only high. Stay off the low-- maximum, at all times. -I'll take care of that. SHARK (OVER RADIO) I'll be by in a while to check everything out. Over. -OK, out. All right, pay attention all stations. Insert alarm system immediately. Bring the sensometric level to coordinates F, 300, K, 9. Prepare circuit for insertion of high tension on entire line of defense. [DISTANT ALARM SOUNDING] [RHYTHMIC EXCITING MUSIC] -Come on.

[WEEPING ON TV CONTINUES] -(ON TV) Spread your legs! -(ON TV) Stop, please! -(ON TV) That's it, that's it. Yes! -[GROANING AND CRYING] [WEEPING INTENSIFIES] -So violence is the best aphrodisiac anyone can get. Don't you think so, Shark? -Absolutely. -I'm very tired tonight. I bid you all good night. All right, Shark, what is it? What do you want now? You just said that violence excites the senses, and I want you. -You can't want anything, Shark-- and certainly not me. You're only an android, which means you are zero. So stay in your place. -[GRUNTS WITH EFFORT] -[CHOKING] -I guess the defense system is controlled from this room. But I don't know how to use controls. -Huh. Well, to tell you the truth, neither do I. But I do know a way that's almost universal. -Wonderful. I'll give you a hand. [GUNSHOT] -Control room, come in. You there, control room? Base calling control room. Come in! [ALARM BLARING] -What's going on? If that's Shark, I'll kill him. [ALARM CONTINUES] -I'll take care of it.

MARGIE (OVER RADIO): Dakar and a bunch of his humanoids got into the castle somehow and destroyed most of the control center. Find them and kill them! -I'll get the others. Just stay in contact. I'll Wipe him out. Here I come, Dakar! [TRASH CRUNCHES] -That you, Braddock? C'mon, quit it. This is no time to be joking around. What the hell's wrong with you? Why don't you answer me? [GUNSHOTS] -Hey, what's wrong out there? Why the shooting? [GUNFIRE] -There's a big battle going on. Lots of people are fighting. Why don't you join up with us? Or are you frightened? -Get back right now. -Hm? [DOOR CREAKING] [GASPS] [DOOR CREAKING] [GUNFIRE] -Don't be afraid.
