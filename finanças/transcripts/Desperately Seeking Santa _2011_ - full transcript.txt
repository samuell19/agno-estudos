OK, thank you. ♪ I can hear the bells ringin' ♪ ♪ The whole world is singin'... ♪ Don't you just love Christmas? The only thing I love about Christmas is the fact that we're about to make a third of our yearly sales in 6 weeks. Every year around the holidays, you put on this Grinch routine. But deep down, I know you are just a big softie who loves Santa and babies and rainbows. Admit it. You watch too many Christmas movies. Are those the QED reports? Yeah. All right. Hmm... It's not straight. Oh, I thought it reminded me of my ex-boyfriend. Hey, Jen! What do you think? Does it look good on me? You better hurry up. We open in 5 minutes. Oh, I am loving the whole illusion today. Who put that together for you? Hmm, you guys did. Aw, she's even wearing those cute little black heels we picked out for her at the 75%-off sale. You have 5 minutes. Fierce. (Siren wailing) (Clearing throat) Today, the official countdown begins. 35 % of our annual retail profits are gonna be earned over the next 6 weeks. Now, is my team prepared? Yes, sir. Hmm? Are you ready? Mm-hmm, yes, sir. Yeah? Well, so is the competition. Last year, our holiday sales showed a 12% decline, yet Internet sales rose 35%. So how can Hillridge Malls compete in this overcrowded market? Incentivize customers to come to us, sir. Exactly right, Ms. Walker. And here's the incentive I'm offering to each of you today. I'm creating a new position. Vice president of marketing and promotions, overseeing all the malls in the northeast. The person with the greatest increase in sales by Christmas Eve wins the promotion. The losers get nothing. You'll be lucky to keep your jobs. Good luck! By the New Year, you're gonna be working here at corporate with me where you belong. You heard? I'm the VP of strategic planning. I know everything that goes on around here. Finally, a chance for you to get out of that vacant dump. It's not a dump. I know. But it's not the suburbs either. I mean, how can I compete with them? Well, you do have the lowest numbers in the group at the moment, but that just means you got nowhere to go but up. Hey, I have faith in you. You can do this. A move to corporate by Christmas would be amazing, and a year earlier than I'd hoped. Do you mind if I take a rain check on our date tonight? I just really wanna focus on this competition. Hey, Jen, you never have to explain a work obligation to me. Hey, that's why I love you. If I get this promotion, I'll be a year ahead of schedule. Yeah, well, I'm already a year ahead of schedule to eat my weight in cinnabuns. So we'll both have something to celebrate. I've got a ways to go before I can celebrate. I've got those sharks from the suburbs breathing down my neck. How can South Boston compete with the ladies that lunch in Hartford? Especially when our working class has been hit so hard? I know. Remember when all the rides were full? I also remember you throwing up on Jake Donovan when you downed one of those ginormous banana splits from the food court. I thought that one was in the vault, missy. (Laughs) I need something that makes South Boston Mall a destination for holiday shopping, you know? Something that inspires people to come to the mall from all over the city, maybe even the suburbs. Something that makes people wanna open their wallets and spend their hard-earned money. Oh! (Laughing) Isn't it a little early for that? It's never too early in the day to start looking at hot men. I mean the holiday sale. We haven't put up Santa's Village yet. Well, clearly, it's working. (♪ Dance beat ♪) Thank you. Wow! Oh, hey, girls! - How are ya? - Hi! Checking out the merchandise? Yes, yeah. - He'll help you out. - Hello there! Have you seen our new line of sequined party dresses? This one is only $129.99. Well, I will take three. You know what? She's fine. Thank you. Three? And he called you "ma'am." He can call me whatever he wants. Guess it's true what they say. Sex really sel... That's it! We all know that the majority of holiday shopping is done by women, right? So let me ask you. What do stay-at-home moms, 20-something career girls and desperate housewives all want to unwrap for Christmas? Anybody? (Clearing throat) I present to you South Boston Mall's Search for Sexy Santa. - Whoo! - That's great! Now, the auditions alone will generate all sorts of press. We'll have a panel to choose the top three. And the audience will get to crown their own Santa. OK, like American Idol, but with hot dudes. Exactly. The winner will get $10,000, half up front and half at the end of business day on Christmas Eve. He'll do a whole dance number, followed by photographs and a sit-down on his lap. Oh! Who can resist that, right? Oh, you're in your uniform. Well, didn't you call me in here because you wanna get a jump on the holidays? Smart move, Jen. Actually, Jim, I called you in here because I have to let you go. (Phone ringing in distance) What are you talking about? Look, I've been Santa at South Boston Mall for 17 years. I'm a tradition! I know. But we're going in a different direction this year. HR has a severance package waiting for you, OK? Sorry. That was so sad. Like you fired my dad or something. Don't look at me like that. I mean, I feel bad too, but I am not gonna get anywhere being everyone's BFF. You'll see. This job isn't as easy as you think. No, I know, I know. I got stuck in a horrendous line. Fifty guys? OK, I'll be right there. Yeah, I'm coming now. Sorry. Hi! Sorry, Ms. Walker, it got cold. But I'll make you a new one. OK, thanks, George. Hey, there's a line. There is. Yeah, man, you tell her. Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. I'm just late for work. Yeah, work's a grind. But we all got someplace we need to be. Right. You know, I think what I'm late for is a little more important than your bike-messenger-delivery thing. Wow! Well, number one, I'm not a bike messenger. And number two, I didn't think you Beacon Hill princesses came down here. And what makes you think I'm from Beacon Hill? The outfit and the attitude. Well, genius, I'm actually from the neighborhood. Born and bred. Could've fooled me. You know, I don't think that would be a very difficult thing to do. (Laughs) Are you always such a little sweetheart in the morning?

He's not finished. Go on, David. Well, we used to watch a dancing show together. And I memorized the routine. And I was gonna do a solo, but can I borrow her? - Yeah, go ahead. - Please.

No. - Yeah. - Mmm, sorry, blue steel. OK, this guy, Moretti. Total poser, right? What are you talking about? He's perfect. Are you kidding me? Using your dead mother to gain points: totally tacky. I think he is a tasty morsel. Total man candy. This guy? Are we talking about the same guy? Good night. Oh, come here. What do you think of this one? Oh, you mean my future husband? See? Look, hello! You change your vote on David, I will vote yes on your juicehead. You can't do that! How badly do you want metal guy in the top three? Bad. Exactly. So let's just say smooth and metro are in. But the third position, let's not fight over it. Let's put it to a secret ballot, shall we? Just vote your conscience. (Bike hitting bike stand) (Horn blaring in distance) (Sighing) (Exhaling sharply) Hey! What are you still doing here? Bike lock's frozen. Ever heard of public transportation? I like the freedom my bike gives me. Oh yeah, it looks really freeing. I feel like we kind of got off on the wrong foot. Understatement of the century. I hope you can be fair in there. Fair? Listen, despite what you might think, I am a total professional who makes impartial judgments based on true merit. If you didn't make the cut, you only have yourself to blame. So I didn't make the cut. I don't know. I haven't looked at the ballots yet. I'll be calling the finalists later tonight. Have a merry Christmas, Miss Walker! (Horns honking) Maureen! I thought you ladies would be halfway through your game of cutthroat poker by now. But then we would've missed the show. What are you talking about? You weren't supposed to see that. (Laughing) Hello, brother! Hello! Looks like all those tap classes Mom made you take finally paid off. Yeah, yeah. Ham, Canadian bacon. What's the difference? Nice of you to finally join us. Hey, Dad hasn't seen this, has he? You flaunting your lame moves for all of Boston? (Laughing) Still not funny. - David! - I guess he has. Hey, Dad, I'm... Late again. Take over for your brother before he scares away all the customers. About the auditions... I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna hear about it. I don't wanna see it. All I wanna see is you helping out here when you're not going to school or studying, OK? OK. Go on. Yeah. - Two colas. - Yeah. He's not in a good mood. He hasn't been in a good mood since the city council's decision to let the Death Star put us out of business. So that's why you did it. - Did what? - The Santa thing. I heard the prize is $10,000, which is about what the lawyer said the appeal would cost. Desperate times. Dad's put everything he has into fighting this thing. Just don't get his hopes up, OK? 'Cause he's already resigned to having to close this place down on Christmas Eve. I don't think I made it past the first round, so there you go. Good. Because the sooner we can all accept that this place is closing, the sooner Dad can deal with it. David, you remember how hard it was for him to move on after Mom died. And losing Moretti's is like losing another family member. Yeah. (Cellular ringing) Yo! "Yo"? That's how you answer your phone? Is this Jennifer Walker? Yes, I'm calling to let you know you made it to the choreography round, after which I'll be crowning the Santa based on our audience votes. Really? Tomorrow, 4:00. Please don't be late. Oh, uh, tomorrow? I'm sorry. Is that a problem for you, Mr. Moretti? No, I'll be there... with my tap shoes on. Yes, three of our hottest contestants in this round. (Phone ringing) You did see the news? Fantastic! (Sighing) Yes, um, David Moretti did make the cut. (Phone ringing) You're sending a reporter? Um, that's fantastic. I will save you a prime spot. Where is he? You have 2 hot guys in front of you and you're worried about the time? Where is David Moretti? He called and said he might be a bit late. I can't stand lateness. If he is not here in 2 minutes, he's cut. He is the reason all of these people came out. You can't do that. Yeah? Watch me. Wow! You are so cold. You know what? It's kind of hot, like a corporate dominatrix. (Imitating whip cracking) (Sighing) Why are you here? Mr. Hillridge couldn't make it, so I decided to be his eyes and ears. That's sweet. Are you still getting your hair cut here? I thought I asked you to go to Christophe in Beacon Hill. He's really good. I just haven't had time. Hi, Neal. Marissa, I didn't even recognize you underneath the poof. That's so funny. Wow, look at that! Quite a crowd, huh? I can't believe the publicity we're getting. I can. You're a marketing genius. I'm here! I'm here! Just on time. Get up there. Hey, I'm really glad you got to look past yesterday morning. Oh, no, don't thank me. If it were up to me, you wouldn't be here.

We want to know why you guys think you should be South Boston Mall's sexy Santa. Because... I'm a hunk... (Cheering and laughing) With a heart. Because Boston... shouldn't be deprived of this... for one minute longer. My mom used to say... "Christmas is about family." And I know a lot of families are going through a tough time right now. And to be honest, my family's having a hard time too. And if I can be Santa and bring joy into those families' lives while helping my own... I would be more than honored to be a part of it. (All): Aw! Thank you. (Cheering) OK, people of South Boston Mall, we want you to cheer as loud as you can for the man that you want crowned. (Cheering) (Louder cheering) (Loud cheering) Well, well, it appears we have a tie. Let's try this again. (Man): Just like a truckload of tar. (Man laughing) And I couldn't believe it 'cause Mario has got... You look like a kid who just lost his bike. - But no, there it is. - Mm-hmm. So what could possibly make you so upset that you're late for a second night in a row? - Dad, I need to talk to you. - Aw, you didn't win. We can't all have a face like this and abs like these. Don't worry. I'll get you to the gym, introduce you to the twins. A little family reunion, OK? Next year. (Laughing) I thought you were done with that. Yeah, Dad, we really need to talk. It's OK, I forgive you. The sooner you forget about that stupid competition, the better. - Right. Hmm? - Huh? - Focus. Focus on your studies. - Right. Get your EMT training. Get into med school. Become the first doctor in the family. One, two, three, huh? Yeah. (Man): Tonight, the first-ever South Boston Mall sexy Santa was crowned. ♪ I feel the pressure mount, mount, mount... ♪ They chose that poor sap over you? Dad... And the winner is David Moretti! Yay! Great! (Cheering) Freak out. (Laughing) I know you don't approve, but that's why I came here to tell you... It's not that I don't approve. I just don't get it. I thought you were done doing crazy stuff like that. I'm worried it'll interfere with school. Well, it's only for a few weeks, and $10,000 goes a long way towards books and tuitions and stuff. I hope you didn't do this for Moretti's. David, I just spent my entire life savings trying to fight these guys all year. I don't wanna see you do the same thing. Come on, take that money. Put it in the bank. We can't win. OK? OK. OK? OK. OK. Oh... (Laughing softly) Ah! Hey! Hey! So you won, huh? (Laughing) I did. I don't know how, but I did. Because you're gorgeous. That's why. Thank you, sister. Guys, I don't wanna get Pop's hopes up, but Moretti's has been in this family for 3 generations. How do we not do everything possible not to save it? You're right. We have to fight. To the bitter end. To Moretti's. (All): To Moretti's. Hi! Hey! I really enjoyed our dance. Aw, thanks. You're... you're Britney, right? Yeah. Oh man! Come on!

Wow! Jennifer, you are doing a fantastic job. Mr. Hillridge would be sufficiently impressed. Really? Have you heard anything about how we're doing compared to the other malls? New Haven's doing a petting zoo right inside the mall. And Paramus hired a couple of twin stars to do a concert series. But don't be concerned about other malls. Be concerned with what's happening here. You got lots of people in the mall. Isn't that a good thing? Well, at the rate he's going, that lineup's about, what, 3 hours long? When do we close? Three hours. People standing in line can't spend money. See you after work, OK? OK. Well, it looks like somebody had a rough year. Smile. (Camera clicking) David. Just wait one little second. What? Twenty seconds per customer. That's the plan. We're competing with malls with double our revenue. But it's Christmas. Look at her. Exactly. We have to exceed our last year's holiday sales. People in line cannot spend money. (Sighing) Santa has all the time in the world for you. So now tell me what happened to that little wing of yours. I crashed my bike on the sidewalk. Next time you're riding a bike and you get scared, think of me and I'll be watching over you. Really? Thank you, Santa. You're the best. Nah, you're the best. Get out of here. So sweet. Why would you do that? I know, I know. I'm a terrible Santa. No, one day, she's gonna grow up and realize there is no Santa. I don't understand it. How does someone who's so clearly against the spirit of the holiday be in charge of promoting it? Don't take it personally, OK? Jen didn't exactly have the best home life. And it's like you said in your audition. Christmas is about family, and the holiday's just a reminder of what's missing. It's too bad. (Whistle blowing) (Whistle blowing) Mwah! Hey! Good. Speed it up, Santa. I'm going as fast as I can. It's not fast enough. Are you never satisfied? I'll be satisfied when I win my promotion. Smile. I am smiling. Like you mean it. It hurts. What's wrong? Sit down. Sit down here. Can't breathe. Are you all right? Just sit down for a second. Oh my God! Are you OK? Senior down in Santa's Village. Someone call 911. - Call 911. - Roger that. I'm on it. Security's on its way. OK, hang on. All right, she has no pulse. - Oh my God! - Come on. Come on. Oh my God! Oh! Did I die and go to heaven? Close. You're at the South Boston Mall. And an ambulance is on its way. I'm in no rush. OK. (Siren beeping) I had no idea you were getting your EMT certification. There's a little something called conversation. You ask me a question about my life, I ask questions about yours and so on and so forth. OK, great. Mrs. Clark, you're in good hands, OK? I know. You may wanna do some tests for a concussion. I'll help you with that Christmas shopping when you're ready. It's a promise. Hmm! Where are you going? Hey, would you punch me out, OK? I'll make up the hours tomorrow, I promise. (Exhaling) Dr. McSexy. I think I'm in love. (Siren wailing) (Siren wailing) (Knocking on door) Is that David? No, Mrs. Clark. It's Jennifer Walker, director of marketing and promotions from South Boston Mall. We met yesterday. Don't take it personally. She hopes everyone who comes through the door is him. You know, he spent all night with her here. Really? Now he's all she wants to see. I don't blame her. He is one hot Santa. Yeah. Look, Mrs. Clark, I just wanted to make sure you were doing all right. Oh, I'll be a lot better when I can get out of this hospital bed and then see Sexy in action. (All laughing) (Door opening) Jennifer. What are you doing here? Don't you have a sales report to obsess over or a holiday temp to fire? Is that what you really think of me? Actually, I think you're one of the more interesting, complicated and yes, at times, infuriating women I've ever met. Well, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work. Those sales reports aren't going to obsess over themselves. No, they won't. And don't be late. Mr. Hillridge himself is coming to check out the show. Hmm! Mrs. Clark kept talking about the pretty girl that came to visit her this morning. I knew we should've cut your hair. Not me, smart ass. You. I think, deep down inside, you might actually be... wait for it... a nice person. There's no secret warm-and-fuzzy Jennifer. I see a girl that eats her meals here. No time to go out and eat. And laughs hard when she's with the Jeremies. They should be a stand-up routine. And loves this mall. OK, I've been working here since I was 17. Of course I've developed relationships and routines with people, but that's just, you know, a means to an end. - Admit you love it. - No. "I love it." Stop. Do you really want that promotion? I mean, this place isn't gonna be remotely the same without you. Why do you even care? You'll be long gone. Besides, I've trained Marissa perfectly to take over when I go to corporate. Whoo! I feel like a Christmas present. ♪ Da, da, da, da, da ♪ Yeah, I could see that. (Marissa laughing) Just be on your best behavior, OK? And that means... Twenty seconds per customer. I get it, I get it. Excuse me. Thanks. There we go. - The line's always busy, sir. - Afternoon, ladies. Welcome. Thank you, Britney. Have a merry Christmas. Goodbye. Sir, I'd like you to meet David Moretti. Hi. Nice save out there, David. I'm just doing what I can. I see you got quite the crowd. Oh, that's all part of Jen's brilliant publicity strategy. Yeah, and I make sure they do not linger on my lap too long so they can get out there and spend their hard-earned money at your mall. You better be sure to keep this one happy, Jennifer. He's your golden Christmas goose. Yes, sir. Nice to meet you, David. You heard the guy. Goose. It seems like everything's running smoothly. Nice job. So are we in the running? You've moved up to 4th place. That's great, right? It's a little more complicated than that. I'm afraid there's more than just a promotion on the line. What are you talking about? I've decided to close the lowest-producing malls after the first of the year. And as of right now, yours is, well, in the line of fire. Sir, but we've improved so much. Even if you're up 20%, you're still way behind the rest in terms of gross profit. This little promotion of yours is giving it a nice bump, but it's just a bump. Unless you come in number one, we're shutting you down. Mr. Hillridge, you can't. This is strictly confidential, not to be discussed with anyone on staff. We have over 900 people working at this mall. This mall's the largest employer in the community. Couldn't we discuss this? Come in first, and there won't be anything to discuss. (Engine starting) (Car driving away) All of my friends are going to be so jealous that I'm gonna be on national TV. OK, you do know that Good Morning Boston is a regional show, right? Yeah. OK. Where is David? (Siren wailing in distance) (Sighing) (Cellular ringing) Yo! Where are you? Good morning to you too, Miss Walker. You have to be on in 30 minutes. What is your ETA? Well, someone locked their... Let me guess. Your bike. I could take a bus. No, that'll take too long. I'll send you a car. Why don't you come pick me up yourself? Look, a taxi would be quicker.

(Laughing) I see nothing's changed. ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ So, Sexy, tell us, what was going through your head when Mrs. Clark passed out right in front of you? I wasn't really thinking. I was more reacting. And when she came to, all I could think about was I didn't want her grandkids not to have her for Christmas. (Women): Aw! And Britney, you get to be in this guy's arms every night. You're the luckiest girl in Boston. I know. Hmm! And I saw you guys on opening night. And you guys have such amazing chemistry together. Does that translate off stage? Well... Oh, I don't kiss and tell. Uh-huh! (Cheering) All right. When we come back, exotic pets and the people who love them. Ooh, like reindeer. Yeah. (Man): And we're clear. (Sighing) Nice to meet you. Oh, a pleasure. Really, nice to meet you. Thank you. Nice plug, Moretti. Huh? I'll see you tonight. Wait, wait, I gotta go to Moretti's. I gotta do lunch service. Why don't you ask Britney for a ride? 'Cause Britney gets lost in the shoe department at Macy's. Fine. So this is your place. Yes. This was my dad's favorite place. I think he even took me here once or twice. No kidding. Well, what's his name? Maybe I served him or something. That's unlikely. He... he left when I was 5. Well, my son the star. You saw it. Of course. You're a local hero. Oh! Dad, this is Jennifer Walker. My dad. Hi! His boss. - Oh! You poor thing. - Yeah. If anyone can understand how difficult a job that is, it's me. (Laughing) Come on inside. We'll make you a pizza. Um, you know what? I can't. I have to get back to work. But thank you. You can't do anything that's not scheduled in your BlackBerry? Nothing? I don't take no for an answer. Come on. It's true. He doesn't take no for an answer. - You have no choice. - OK, he doesn't take no. Um, I'd love to help. I just have to get back to work. Come on, do something that's not planned for once. That is the woman from the mall David was complaining about. No, I believe the words he used were "unlikable bi..." Uh, well, he sure seems to like her now. OK, what kind of pie do you like to make, huh? Um, I actually... That's sweet, but I'm OK. I don't eat pizza. It's like carbs. When I was a kid, I'd get pepperoni. - Ah, purist! I like that. - Mm-hmm. David, get an apron. You're gonna learn how to toss dough. Oh, no, David, I... He's the boss, so just do it. OK. Oh! (Clearing throat) Ready? I think so. OK. Flick the wrist then let go. Flick the wrist and then let go. It's not too hard. Oh! (Laughing) Sorry. No, it's good. You're using too much arm and not enough wrist. Gentle, gentle. See? Hmm! Gentle. Yeah. (Screaming) (David and father laughing) (Laughing) (Laughing) (Grunting) Hey, uh, sorry. Pop can get pretty persistent at times. No, don't apologize. He seems sweet. I'm glad he cares so much. Yeah. (Laughing) So that must be your mom. Yes, it is. She loved Christmas. She made this giant feast every year. It certainly sounds like a better Christmas than I had growing up. Chinese takeout and a bottle of wine. The wine was for my mom, not me. So is that the plan this year? Chinese takeout, bottle of wine with Mom? Uh, yes to the Chinese takeout. No to the mom. She died when I was 17. I'm sorry, Jen. But nobody should spend Christmas alone. It's just another day. It's not a big deal. Are those yours? Yes, I need to study whenever I can. So you what? You work for your family. Mm-hmm. You go to school and you moonlight at our mall. Yeah. I had no idea you were that ambitious. Hmm! Because when you first met me, you thought I was a bike messenger. So I'm not really giving you that much stock in your powers of perception. Mm-hmm. What's that? That is a big corporation trying to put us out of business. Come here. To make room for that beacon of steel and glass. How can they do that? Money. That's how they got the other local merchants to give up the fight. We're the only holdouts. But we're running out of time. So you're not closing Christmas Eve. Not if I can help it. This building has been around forever. I'm trying to get it designated a historical landmark. Hmm! You think that's gonna work? Oh, it's gotta work. I have just enough money for one last appeal. And the city council votes on Christmas Eve. 10:00 a.m. So that's why you took the Santa job. No, I did it for all the pretty girls and free meals. Ah! (Both laughing) Hey, listen, um, Pop doesn't know about the appeal. He's too proud to ask for help. That's very noble of you, David. It's not noble. It's family. It's what you're supposed to do. (Cellular chiming) Oh no! No, no, I forgot! I'm late. Pop's just about to fire up a pizza. I'm sorry, I can't cancel this. Thank you. (Door opening) So, when's the wedding? (Door closing) Me and her? (Laughing softly) Besides, she's got a boyfriend. Some corporate bigwig. Your mom had a boyfriend when we first met. I'm just saying. (Woman laughing) (♪ Joy to the World on stereo ♪) Hey. Oh, hey! Sorry. The taping went later than I thought. Well, we only have 45 minutes for lunch now. I ordered you a caprese salad. Oh. I've got a meeting with the lawyers at 2:00. We're settling on some condos in South Carolina. I thought Hillridge only invested in commercial real estate. Our business plans adapt whenever there's good opportunities. (Sighing) Hey, did, uh, did Hillridge say anything to you about shutting down the lowest-producing malls? Neal! Why didn't you tell me? I'm responsible for the jobs and the lives of 900 people. I can't even imagine the effect it'll have on South Boston if we closed. It's not gonna happen. What about the petting zoo in New Haven or the tween concert series in Paramus? I can't compete with that. The petting zoo in New Haven was a P.R. disaster after one of the donkeys escaped And those tweens, they had to cancel. Jen, my dear. You are gonna win that promotion. You're gonna come in number one. You're gonna get out of that dump. You're gonna work with me in corporate. It's not a dump, Neal. It's just a figure of speech. So, I was thinking, um, I usually celebrate Christmas with my parents in Aspen. Why don't you come? We've been together for over a year and you've never introduced me to them. Well, they can be a little hard on newcomers, but, um, I think it's time. I have an idea. What if we do something fun and romantic for once, like a pizza-making course together, just the two of us. It'll be great. Well, don't be ridiculous. I mean, Aspen is the place to be over the holidays. I don't wanna upset my parents. Don't be silly. I wasn't thinking. I was more reacting. Well, when she came through, all I could think about was I don't want her grandkids to spend Christmas without her. Really happy our sales are up. The Santa promotion is working really well, so we're happy. Have a good night. Hey! Hey. OK, you either had a Scarface moment or you need some dandruff shampoo, pronto. No, that's just flour from David's restaurant. What? You had lunch with David? Dish! OK, calm down. I didn't have lunch with David. I dropped him at the pizza place and then I had lunch with Neal. Oh. Tonight was our best show, yet. ♪ ...get those presents over here ♪ ♪ I hear bells through the snowy night... ♪ Dip! Oh my god! You like him! David? Please! Anyway, Neal invited me to Aspen to have Christmas with his family. Wow! Christmas with the Stepfords, how fabulous! Well, I'd love to hear you bash my boyfriend, but we really need to be analyzing these numbers, instead of my love life. Why, I thought we were kickin' ass. I've just been going over the latest figures, and it looks like we've plateaued. I really need to keep up the traffic. I'm sure we'll get a bump from the television appearance today. Yes, but is he on Twitter? Is he on Facebook? We can't just keep relying on what we've done in the past. We really need to push until we're number one. You know, if we weren't best friends, I'd start to be a little offended that you're so desperate to get this promotion and get away from us. If you could just do your job, please... Yes, boss. Hey. What are you still doing here? What are you still doing here? Had the guys at Jamba Juice put this in the refrigerator. I hope you don't mind cold pizza. Are you kidding me? My mom used to work nights. Cold pizza for breakfast was a Walker staple. But I can't. I know, I know. The carbs, the carbs. But think of Leo when he finds out that you threw away a perfectly good Moretti's pizza. - You wouldn't. - Oh, I would. I absolutely would, yeah. And you don't want to be on the receiving end of Leo's wrath, believe me. Fine. Mmm! So this is what I've been missing out on all these years. Amongst other things, yes. I'm not that uptight, OK? I once ate an entire vat of butter-cream frosting from the food-court bakery on one of Marissa's dares. Shut up! And this one time, I drove the getaway car when the Jeremys decided to T.P. Marissa's jerky ex-boyfriend's prized Camaro. Does Hillridge realize that he has a criminal mastermind working for him? (Both chuckling) You should smile more.

Let me just go freshen up, OK? (Sighing) Jen! Neal. I, uh, I didn't know she had company. Oh, we were actually just gonna go out for a bite of real food. OK. Well, uh, tell her I'll see her tomorrow. You know what, David? You're doing a wicked job here. Thanks. In fact, I'm pretty confident that Jennifer will win that promotion in corporate, where she and I will be working side by side. Well, I hope she gets everything she wants. She will. In fact, I'm gonna ask her to move in with me at Christmas. And I'd really appreciate it if you didn't do anything to stand in our way. I would never stand in her way. It's good to hear. After all, you're nothing more than a little Christmas eye candy that everybody's gonna fill up on and get sick of as soon as Christmas is over. David? Was there something else? We were just leaving. No. No. Have a good night. (Chuckles) (Talking, indistinct) (Talking, indistinct) Loraine, get me New York. Mr. Hillridge. Hi. I just wanted to show our latest numbers. I'll take a look at these when I get a sec. Thanks. Uh, transfer it to my office, Lorrain. Our lawyers will set up a numbered company and take care of all the paperwork. Thank you. - Jennifer! - Hi. Uh, did we have a lunch date? No, no, no. I just came by to drop off the newest reports, to show Mr. Hillridge how profitable our mall's becoming. Well, great. (Telephone ringing) Was that Councilman Quinn? What was going on in there? Uh, well, I can't really talk about it. But it could elevate the whole Hillridge brand. I gotta jump on a call right now, but, uh, I'll see you tomorrow night for date night. OK. OK. (Telephone ringing) (Cars honking) I've been eating here every week for 30 years. You guys are like family. I can't believe you're closing Christmas Eve. Don't count us out just yet, OK? The city council's not making the final vote till the 24th. We may have a few tricks up our sleeves. Hmm? Ah. Where's boss lady tonight? How should I know? You haven't introduced a girl to the family in years. You must really like this one. I don't introduce girlfriends to you, because you're like vultures, you rip... See? Now she's your girlfriend. No, you took what I said and spun it around. ♪ David and Jenny sitting in a tree ♪ ♪ K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪ (Both laughing) Pops, they're pickin' on me again. What? What's up, Pop. I just got a call from the attorney, the one you hired to file the appeal. I, uh, I can explain. It's all right. It's OK. But all that money just went down the drain. City council denied the appeal. What do you mean? Our hearing was scheduled for the morning of Christmas Eve. They had an emergency meeting. They're not even gonna hear the appeal. So they're not even gonna listen to us? I'm gonna go down there and explain to them what they're doing. Son, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but it's over. It's over. Mr. Hillridge? Jennifer, what can I do for you? I really need to speak with you about something. I know! You wanna make sure I saw your latest figures. Uh, no. Actually, it's about Archfield Towers. Archfield Towers. I thought saving the jobs of 900 people at South Boston Mall was your number-one priority. It was, but... It is. You'd be glad to know I've looked over your reports. You've now officially moved up to 2nd place. We have? We don't have anything else to discuss, do we? Uh, no, sir. Good. Because you don't get to first by taking your eye off the ball. It's not like telling him will change anything. Don't you think David should know he's working for the very corporation he's trying to fight? If I tell David, he might quit and that's not acceptable when we're one week away from Christmas Eve and when we're one spot away from being number one. I don't get you anymore, Jen. David's family is losing their livelihood, and all you stand to lose is a stupid promotion. I mean, have you really gotten that cold? It's more complicated than that, Marissa. Then let me simplify it for you, OK? Tell David before you become someone I don't know or like at all. (Man): For about 10 years. (Jeremy): 10 years? Let me know if you need fashion tips. - I would love one. - Here you go. Hey, David, have you seen Jennifer? No. Who is she and what did she do to you? (Jennifer): OK, thanks. If you want my advice, tell her how you feel. before things get too weird and you enter that purgatory known as the friend zone. (Jeremy): Give me a call. I absolutely will. That's fantastic. Would you like a drink? Yes, thanks. Maybe you should take your own advice. David, what are you doing here? You have to be on in 5 minutes. I know, but I found something out today that put everything into perspective and I really need to talk to you. Yeah, I did too. There's something you should know. I know you have a boyfriend and I know you're on this corporate path that probably doesn't include someone like me. Someone like you? David, anybody would be lucky to have someone like you! They denied our request for an appeal. What? I thought they weren't voting until Christmas Eve. Councilman Quinn ordered an emergency meeting today. Councilman Quinn. They didn't even let us argue our case and then I couldn't go through life if I didn't do the same for you. - David, I need to... - Jen... You have to admit you felt something when we kissed. I know I felt it. I felt it like a ton of bricks. I mean, I've never, ever met anyone who excites me or frustrates me as much as you do. I wanna give this a shot. David, I don't know how to tell you this. Hillridge is behind Archfield Towers. He's the reason your family is going out of business. Wait, wait. What? I'm sorry. Yeah, but you know Hillridge. You could talk to him, right? I can't. My hands are tied. (Scoffing) You knew about this all along? No! (Stammering) I introduced you to my family! How could you do that? You don't understand. You're right, I don't understand anything about you. I quit. You can't. Really? Watch me. No, it's in your contract. Hillridge will sue you if you walk out voluntarily. You'll lose everything! I already have. (Sighing) (♪ Deck the halls ♪) It's like watching one of those creepy, robotic Santas in the department store windows. I know. I've never seen David this crushed before.

(Giggling) I'm gonna miss you. Ah! (Dancers chattering) Hi. It's so sad. Like the last day of camp. Oh, don't, don't. I'll see you around the neighborhood. Hey, and don't forget about those community college classes we talked about. I won't. Listen. Underneath her tough exterior, Jen really does have a heart. I know, but it's buried pretty deep. Hey, hear her out. It's not as bad as it seems. And besides, it's Christmas, and everyone deserves a little charity at Christmas. Yeah, but Jen doesn't believe in Christmas. (Giggles) Remember? Marissa said, uh, to come get my check from you. You were worth every penny. Glad I could help advance corporate greed. That's not what I meant. David.... I hope you have a merry Christmas. I hope when you get everything you want... that it was all worth it. Me to. (Siren in distance) (Sighing) You know, I've worked here my entire life. I'm gonna look forward not coming home at night covered in flour. (Chuckling) I feel like they've taken our Christmas. Oh, come on, baby. No, no, no. Come on. What did Mama always say, hmm? (All 3): A good Christmas isn't about gifts, it's about... Family! And nobody can take that away from us, OK? So instead of dwelling on all we lost this year, let's count our blessings on all we still have, huh? A beautiful, healthy family. Another baby on the way. (Chuckling) You OK? I just don't understand how Hillridge could take Moretti's away from us and to not even give it a 2nd thought. And to think, Dad, I was part of that machine. Well, you couldn't have known anything about it. Don't beat yourself up over it. Well, is that the only thing bothering you? Jennifer. Hmm! You told me she said she didn't know anything about it and that she was brutally honest in the past. Why would she lie about this now? People say things to get what they want. Hmm... I find it hard to believe that it's all about the bottom line for her. You know, Jennifer may have a tough exterior, but... I thought she was a real sweetheart. (Ringing) (Beep) Jennifer Walker. Jennifer. Mr. Hillridge. Did I catch you at a bad time? Uh, no, this is a perfect time. I just finished going over the numbers. You've really outdone yourself, Jennifer. Your holiday revenue is up 25%. I don't know how you did it. Wait, does this... Congratulations, yes. You are my new V.P. of Marketing. Next year, you'll be working with me at corporate. You're kidding. We're number one? Yes. Uh, there's just one more thing. I'm gonna need you to spearhead the closing of the mall first. Excuse me? Don't worry, H.R. will be in touch about setting up exit interviews. Wait, you said that if we came in number one the mall would be safe. Those numbers aren't sustainable, not without Christmas, not without our Santa. Look, Mr. Hillridge, these are good people. They need their jobs. We will do a final inventory January 31st before making the announcement. We gotta keep everyone on their toes. No, sir! Please just... Look, don't let this overshadow what you've accomplished, Jennifer. You've given yourself the best Christmas present possible. We'll celebrate at the party tonight. See you then.

Heaven help me. Hey, Jen. Congratulations on the promotion! - Whee! - We hate to see you go. But what an exciting Christmas surprise. Um, I hope you don't mind, but David invited us to the Moretti closing party tonight. Oh, um, no! Go, please, by all means. I mean, have fun. I have to stay with the suits all night. Listen, we know you already have on that boring, black dress, but now that you're the V.P. of marketing, we thought you should have something with a little more fab factor. (Marissa): Ta-da!

You got what you always wanted, a promotion to corporate. Why aren't you celebrating? They're closing the mall, Neal. How can I celebrate, knowing the people that helped me get my promotion will be out of jobs by the new year? It's collateral damage. Don't worry. They'll find something else. You knew? I know everything that happens at Hillridge. Come on, babe. Be happy! Besides, you're not the only one celebrating a promotion. Really? You are looking at the new senior V.P. of Strategy. Hillridge rewards resourcefulness. Resourcefulness? Mm-hmm. Is that what you call brokering deals with corrupt politicians? Hillridge would never invest in residential real estate.

To Hillridge Enterprises annual executive holiday gathering. But my first order of business tonight is to congratulate our newest vice president, Jennifer Walker. (Cheering) She's a long-time employee, having started out here as a floater at the age of 17. And her victory was made possible by a brilliant re-branding of our holiday business model, with the success of her South Boston Santa. Jennifer, a few words. (Applause) Oh! Well done! Congratulations! (Sighing) Christmas was nothing more to me than one of the biggest retail opportunities of the year. But as someone very wise said... Christmas isn't about sales reports or profits. It's about family. And since I really have none to speak of, the people of South Boston Mall have become my family. And collateral damage or not... I can't just sit back and celebrate the destruction of that family. I'm sorry. I can't do this. (Man): Jennifer! Jennifer. Jennifer. Do you have any idea what you're doing? You close South Boston Mall and I'll go public with your backroom deals. You don't wanna play that game with me. You should be proud, sir. I learned from the best. And while you're at it, find a new home for Archfield towers. Doesn't fit in the neighborhood. Merry Christmas. (Car honking) Taxi! Jennifer? Are you OK? Yeah. No, I... I can't get a cab and I have to get to Old Town before Christmas Eve is over. Well, hold on. I'll help you. Why would you help me? I... I probably ruined your Christmas. You can't ruin my Christmas!
