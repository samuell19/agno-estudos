You need a hand? Sure, I'll wash, you dry. Okay, at least you gave me the easy job. So, what's on your mind? Ma, is Daddy involved in anything illegal? No. Your dad? Absolutely not. How can you afford this house? This house is huge and you know we grew up in that little three-bedroom apartment so... Look. Your father has worked for this all of his life. This is the product of his hard work. He wanted a place everyone could come to and enjoy themselves. Okay, I guess so. But, Preston wants to marry me. What? Yes. Oh, baby, when are you getting married? I didn't exactly say yes to him. Why not? He seems like such a nice young man. Because I made a promise to Daddy that if I was to ever get married that he would have to approve of the man. Oh, Lord, you know how your father is with those things. So when is Preston planning to ask him? I don't know, Ma. Preston just trying to win points with Daddy. I think he's gonna ask him sometime during Thanksgiving dinner. Mm, well, we'll see how that works out. Oh, Ma, you know you do have a dishwasher, right? And I know I wash dishes better than the dishwasher. Okay, Ma, I'm going get dressed. All right, baby. Hey, wake up boy. We have a busy day ahead of us. Oh, hey, beautiful. How are you? I'm good, but what the hell happened to you? You look like you been in a train wreck. I just, my head is killing me. I think I need an ibuprofen. Oh, damn, you stink, too. What the hell you been doing? All right there young fellow, rise and shine. I'm including you on our annual Thanksgiving hunting trip. Hunting? Daddy, Preston doesn't believe in the killing of animals. Don't believe in killing animals? How the hell this nigga eat then? Preston's a vegan. No, it's cool, it's cool. I don't mind going hunting. You don't? No, it'll be fun. Okay. Plus it'll give me a chance to bond more with your dad. Boy, what the hell happened to you? You look like shit. He smell like shit, too, but no, Daddy, he just had a hard time sleeping last night in there, that's all. All right, go wash your ass and get dressed. Yeah, bye stinky. You did what? I didn't tell you to take him on a damn money pickup. Look, I needed an extra body. I could have pulled that shit off by myself. Just give me my money and get the hell outta my face. Yeah, about the money. This albino silver back named Desmond got it. How the hell a silver back named Desmond got my money? Preston fucked the whole thing up. You got 48 hours to give me my money.

Man, they make Jenny look like Whoopi Goldberg with doo-doo flats. Yeah, yeah, Dad, but I seen him with the flats. Yes. Broke finger and all that shit. Don't you touch me. And then... This is unbelievable Preston. I can't believe this. Preston, have I not taught you anything. Do you not know who we are these days? Me and your mother. You ain't no ordinary Negro, Preston. I'm tired of this. Oh, baby, are you okay? What was he thinking? I have no clue. Yeah. Baby, I have a terrible hangover. I'll make you some tea and soup, okay. Yeah, I'm never drinking again. Please do not, son. You know how you get with a little bit of alcohol in your system. Why would you get pissy drunk like this? Mom and Dad, could you please excuse me? I need a word with Madison. Fine, let's go, honey. Please. I'm sorry. Babe. Listen, baby, I don't care what happened. I realized I can't live without you. I can't live without you, either. The motherfucker stopped pointing the gun and shit, start pistol whipping me like this. Is that why you look like shit? I gave you the task of handling this transaction Alonzo. But this Joe wants his money. We all gonna be dead. Damn, Daddy, don't you got some money stashed away? I mean, how you let this shit happen? I don't have enough funds to liquidate it. By the time I get it, it's gonna be too late. What you gonna tell Ma? I ain't gonna tell her shit and you better not either. I'll figure something out. Please forgive me for everything I did. Please forgive me for my behavior. I do. Yeah, but there's only one more thing. What's that, baby? I got to talk to your dad. Yeah. I love you. I love you. Let's go. Okay.

How the hell he owe you Daddy? Stay out of it baby girl. Stay away from that lyin', cheatin' bastard. Cheatin'. He owes me $150,000. He spent it on them hos and gambling. No, wait, wait, wait, a minute, what are you talking about, sir? You stole my money. Alonzo, get my shit. Aw shit! Wait, wait, wait, dammit, wait! This doesn't make any sense. Preston doesn't need to steal. Yeah. That nigga ain't need to cheat neither, but he did that shit, too. Come on. Preston wouldn't cheat on Madison. I would never Oh, really? What? Okay, I bet you 10,000 he did. And I got proof. Look, my son, I will take that bet, sir. You'll take that bet, sir? All right, well, let's have a look then. Let's see, mm. What is he talking about.

Come on, Preston, let's go pack your things. We can see where we're not welcome. You'll not be seeing us again. You uncivilized fucking children. Daddy, what you doing? It's ridiculous, I'm leaving, too. If he wanted to make a wish come true he'd have gave us continue to knock him out. Come on, y'all, let's get ready for this game. Stop, Von. Let me see your phone. Dang. How the hell we gonna play this game we got these monster Bamas looking for you, Dad? Look, it's Thanksgiving. They ain't doing nothing on Thanksgiving. Hey, baby. I'm gonna pack my bag, too. No, you stay here. I don't want you to have any more tension with your family. Baby, I don't care about any of that. I just want you. Get the hell off of me. Look, it's for the best. We need some space, Madison. Preston. Madison, I said it's over. I shamed both of our families, can't you see that. Just let me go. Whatever, I am gonna clear my head and I suggest that you do the same. I'm not doing anything. Daddy! No! Boy, if you playing quarterback, let me tell you right now. I'm be like Deon Sanders. I'm talking about prime time. Leroy, you ready to get your ass whooped? Man, shut up Dirk Fisher. Got your son over here dressed like and African bottle of Sunny Delight. Let's do this shit.

These men said they're gonna kill me unless you pay them their money. Mr. Givens, you did not keep your word. You told me I would have my money. Now I'm gonna show you how I keep my word. If I don't get my money, I'm gonna make sure I send your daughter back in pieces. Bring the money to Iverson Mall in an hour. No police or she dies. Daddy, please. Madison! Maurice, what are they talking about? Why do these people have our daughter? I'll tell you why? Huh. It comes from all of his drug dealing. How else do you think he's able to afford this big old fancy house. What? Drug dealing? Maurice, what in the hell is he talking about? So this is all your fault? What else haven't you told me? No, it's his fault. He gambled all our money away. That's bullshit. Your son and Von lost all of your money. None of this is important right now. We all have to work together to get Madison back. Let's just put our differences aside and think. Where are they holding her, Maurice? Well, I know where they're holding her, but the problem is how am I gonna get $150,000 in cash. Hold up. Yeah. You have the money? Chop got 20 on him. Ain't got time for your jokes right now. Listen, everyone focus. How much money do we have, honestly? Well, I got a little over $150,000 in the bag plus some jewelry. Here, take these. None of this material stuff is important. I just want my baby back. I want her back, too. Would you calm down. Let me see. Oh, okay. Put something in it, dweeb. Dad, I love her. Alonzo, can you go downtown and see if you can get all this finished. Yes, sir, I got you, Daddy, okay. Need her back now. We're gonna get her back son. Mr. Givens. I hope you're not wasting my time. I'm sorry. But the bag feels quick light. No, the code word is Megan Good can get the wood, yes, it is me, Mr. Disco. I have my broker here on the line. He's ready to wire you $135,000. Do you accept? Nobody is there. Is she worth this son? Yes, she's worth every cotton pickin' cent. Okay, give me my baby girl back. As soon as the money hits my account. My money is good everywhere, son. Excuse me. You're lucky you have rich friends. You really fucked up this time, though. I'm through with your ass after this. Grab the girl. Where is she? Baby, sweetie, you all right. Get off of me. Yes. Baby, girl, did he hurt you? Did they hurt you? They're no gentlemen that I know of. Are you all right. Get her out of here, let's go. Thank God. You enjoy that money. Okay. So ridiculous, fuck. They didn't touch me. Made me pay $135,000. Amaya. Amaya! What? Can you get me some hot sauce out of the cabinet, please? I'm not your maid. Amaya, I am getting really tired of your smart mouth. Would you rather me have a dumb mouth like cousin Alonzo. Oh, Lord, please don't let me kill this girl. You better not touch me or I'm gonna call CPS. You wouldn't. Watch me. Either you beat her or I'm gonna beat you. No, stop, I'm sorry. That's right, whoo! Whoo! About damn time. Girl with the belt like this. Bad ass little girl. Shit. What's up, girl? Hey, um, you coming over later tonight. And what the fuck am I coming over there for. Well, you said that if I did what you asked that, you know, we would be together. Girl, I was just fuckin' with you man. Nobody want your stink ass. Oh, man, go brush your damn teeth. Damn, man. Smart ass. No shame, son. She gonna do it again. Keep beating that ass. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yeah, she feeling it now. Girl got a nice swing, don't she? Mom, please, I'm sorry. I love you. Excuse me everybody, I would like to make a toast. You mean halitosis. Anyway, this toast is for the most self-centered, arrogant, son of a bitch that I know. This toast is for that conniving ass Von. I would also like to say that Madison didn't sleep with Von and I didn't sleep with Preston. It was all just a lie created by Von to break you two up. Don't do this shit, no, shut up. Madison, Preston, I would like to apologize for my part in all of this. Please forgive me. Oh, um, and Daddy, Alonzo and Von here, they lied about all that money that came up missing. What the hell? Why you gonna say my name. Oh, you lie like shit. That's why your breath smell like rotten eggs and shit. I knew it. Bullshit. You are trash. Yeah, uh, can I get everybody's attention please. So I've been wanting to say this for a while, but I just was waiting for the right time and I feel now since we have the whole family here that this is the right time. So Mr. Givens, I wanted to let you know and your family that I love your daughter, Madison, more than words could ever express, right? And I want to spend the rest of my life with her. Would you be so kind and let me have your daughter's hand in marriage? Marry my baby girl? Yes. Oh, hell no. Ain't nobody good enough for my baby. I don't care how much you paid them earlier. Maurice, how could you? He ain't good enough for her. Oh! If you're gonna act like this, get outta my house. I'm not gonna let you ruin these young people's future. Get your drug dealing ass outta my house. All right, Preston, I'm happy. Speak up! All right, Preston. I'd be happy if you'd be my son-in-law. Now that's better. And by the way, you're sleeping on the doggie bed and you better pay him every time back. Now, Preston, dear, isn't there something you wanted to do? Madison Givens, I... I want to know... This ring. Make me, Preston Mitchell, the happiest man in the world by marrying me and being my wife. Yes, yes, yes, Preston, yes. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah, hallelujah! Yeah. See that rock. You see that rock. So look, so family, just briefly, I have to take care of some business, may I step away for a second? Don't be too long. Mrs. Mitchell. Yes. Yeah. Oh, my God. Come on, you can do it, you can do it. A chip off the old block. Married man now. Oh, Von. Congrats bitch, I mean. Whoa. Bro. I'm happy for you, man. Know what, Von, thank you, man. Hey, dad, hey, guess what? I'm about to beat the brakes off that thing. Oh, no you not, aw! Hey, Ma! Guess what? Oh, boy, just get the hell outta my face. And that's what I thought, too. Don't forget that shit either. Once you strip it up, wreck that boss like heaven ass, whoo hoo! Ham hocks, were are you girl? Damn. What took you so long? I had to take my pills again, you know, get this baloney pony ready. Yeah, yeah. I'm the type of motherfucker to give up anything. Well, you about to have the time of your life. You ready? Yes.
