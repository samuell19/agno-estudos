Hey. Hey. Holy shit. What happened to you? Who did this to you? Who fucking did this to you? Who do you think? That's it. He's fucking dead. No. Stay. Please stay. What did he say to you? Who gives a shit what he said to me? I think he broke my cheekbone. Does this hurt? Everything hurts. Is it swollen bad? Tell me exactly what he said to you. Tell me! Can you just, please, hold me? Sh, it's okay. Hey. Hey, hey, sh. Hey, you got guts. You got guts, kid. I love you. No, you don't. You hardly know me. I love you, no matter what you say. And I don't care if you love me back. I don't... I don't care. I don't suppose you have any beer, do you? None in my house, either. Can I have one of these? We go through all the trouble of not being seen together, and for what? Do you want to order a pizza or something? You want pepperoni or sausage? Sausage. What I wouldn't do for a shot of whiskey. That's why we're here, right? I am in over my head, Miriam. I can't take care of a kid by myself. I mean, Megan, she wasn't that much help, but at least I wasn't alone, you know? From what you told me, it was worse than being alone. Yeah, but Carter needs a mother, you know? He just can't keep surviving off of frozen dinners and macaroni and cheese. I can't take care of him. I can't even take care of myself. And all he cares about is that damn swimming. To tell you the truth, I could give a shit. How's that, huh? All I want to do is get drunk and get laid. Is that so bad? At least now you're being honest. It's nothing so terrible. It's just that it's a slippery slope, Stephen. You know? Nobody said 60 days was a magic number. It just... it doesn't stop being hard. You feeling any better? Yeah. Oh, hey. You're up late. Oh, my God! What happened? I got into a fight at school. Oh, sweetheart. - We should get you cleaned up. - No, no, I'm fine. It just looks worse than it is, that's all. This guy that did this... I hope you gave as good as you got. I got in a few hits. You know I have to go to the school, right? Mom, you don't have to make things worse. Now, don't tell me my job. You're not helping. So, are you hungry? Did you get something to eat? Yeah, Carter came over. We ordered pizza. Okay. Why don't you go on to bed. It's late. We'll talk about it in the morning. Okay. Love you. Kiss. - Good night. - Good night. I ought to report this guy. I'm telling you... I told you. We did not need to make such a big deal out of it. - What? - They jumped me. Kids get jumped every day. Well, then its wrong every day, Danny. Come on, let's go. I'm not going to the emergency room for four hours just so they can tell me I have a black eye. No, we have to file a police report, Danny. No, Mom, we don't. Not everything is a human rights battle. Relax. I'll deal with it. Mom. These are Carter's friends, right? Did Carter have something to do with this? Is that why you don't want to call the police? Of course not. I have to get back to class. I'll see you when I get home. - Hey, not today. - What? Come on. We have to talk. - You can miss class for a day. - Are you kidding? So there's something you're not telling me. What is it? They beat me up... They beat me up because I'm gay, Mom. Really? Why now? Why Henry? You've never had any trouble with him before. He thinks Carter and I are going together. Does Carter feel the same way? He doesn't want to admit it, but I know that he does. We had sex. Safe? - Yeah, safe. - Are you sure? Yeah. And I liked it. Okay. - A lot. - Okay! Listen. The next time, I'm going to file charges. - Do you understand me? - No... I don't want to hear any arguments about it. I'm not having you end up on the evening news. I love you, Danny. You're my little angel boy. You've never given me any reason to feel ashamed. Hey, Coach! Coach! What is it, Carter? I'm late. Hey, uh, you gave me the 100-meter freestyle. And? Well, you gave Henry the 200-meter breast. That's my decision, Carter. But, Coach, come on, that's my best stroke. Henry's swimming the 200 breast. He's got the endurance. End of story. Anything else? How's your sleeping? Any better? - Yeah. - Are you taking anything for it? No. 'Cause if you're taking anything for it, I need to know. No. No, Coach, I'm not. We have three days, gentlemen. That's it. We're not there yet. I don't want any of you thinking that we're home free. So in these next three days, I want you to remember, never let up. These two are begging to be large scale. Don't you think? I was hoping you'd say that. I'm thinking about painting a series in acrylic. These are really wonderful, Danny. Tremendous improvement. Very well done indeed. Beautiful sense of space. There's an openness suggested by the poses. A certain vulnerability. Maybe all the inspiration you really needed was a different model. I'm that obvious? We're all inspired by different things, Danny. You know, every once in a while, I have the great fortune to meet a student like you. You're young and full of promise. There's nothing you can't do if you set your mind to it. I don't get it man, we're supposed to be teammates. Why are you always giving me such a hard time? Who's the queer you're hanging out with, huh? The one that draws? He's my English tutor! Not that that's any of your business. So leave him alone, okay? Do you hear what I'm telling you, Henry? What do you care? Just leave him the fuck alone, all right? I hope you're not going funny on me, man. Dude, are you really a homo? Aw, what's the matter? Did I hurt your feelings, huh? Here's an idea. Why don't you go tell your boyfriend? Maybe he can buy you some flowers. Make you feel better. I'd like your essays now, please. Well thank your for joking us, Mr. Melman. Please pass them forward. Yes? I don't have it. If you don't have your essay today, I don't want it. You've been warned. You've had plenty of time. Margaret, would you please collect them from the front of each row. Hm. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven of your classmates are out today with the essay flu. Please give them my best get well wishes. Thank you, Margaret. Oh! Okay. Please take out a fresh sheet of paper. Hey. What's that, Dad? Fan Mail. Yep. Although I wish I wasn't so popular. Big day tomorrow, huh? Better get some rest. I am going to have the best race of my life tomorrow. Yeah, well, maybe you should adjust your expectations just a little. Thanks for the vote of confidence there, Dad. Yeah, well, just trying to keep it real, Romeo. Can't you say anything encouraging every once in a while? Sure. Give me a reason every once in a while. I should be hearing back from UT any day now. Carter. Carter, I got to tell you something. What's wrong? What? Are you trying to talk me out of it? You can't go back now. - You said that if I got... - No, no. no. No, I just need to tell you something and I'm not sure how you're going to take it. That's all. What? Is it about me going to school in Texas? No, it's not about that. It's got nothing to do with swimming. Jesus, you're like a fucking broken record. Is it about those blackouts? Because that was just... No, it's about your mother. She's in jail. She called a while ago asking for bail money. Is she okay? She's fine. She's always fine. Carter, listen. Carter! - Hey, Carter's up next. - Yeah. It's the 100-meter something or other. Freestyle. Now, where is he? Lane 5. It's his first event, so he's fresh, too. They all seem so tall. Don't any short boys swim? What does that mean? False start. He's okay as long as he doesn't do it again. He's nervous. Come on, Carter. I know you can do it. Well, it's not his stroke. Come on, come on, come on. Second. What do you want? Is everything okay? You weren't in English class today. Nope, everything is totally fucked up. Everybody thinks you did fine. I don't. Well, did you see the school newspaper? Your picture's in it. Great. That's fucking great. Are you coming over later? I don't think so. How come? Because I don't feel like sitting around naked for you today. All right? I got better fucking things to do. I'm finished with the drawings anyway. I just thought you might like to see them. Look, we need to cool things off, okay? Can't you tell you're fucking up my whole performance. You sure those pills don't have anything to do with it? Shut the fuck up! What do you know? You think you know me? You don't know me! You don't know anything! Yeah, sure. I don't know anything. But at least I know how I feel. I wish I never fucking met you! You fucked everything up for me! - What the hell did I do? - I didn't want any of this! You're hurting me! Let go! You're trying to change me! Get off of me! Get the fuck out of here then! - Go! - Why are you acting like this? Are you fucking deaf? Not now. Carter, listen. Life's going to be handing you a lot more disappointments than this. And don't think I'm going to let you sit in there and feel sorry for yourself after what happened today, all right? Thanks, Dad! I really appreciate that! Hey! Toughen up! Oh, great! Sure! Right Away! You can't prove it. Are you kidding? It's obvious. Oh, all right. Then for argument's sake, let's say Danny wrote it. What are you going to do, Robert? Fail them both? I can't believe I'm hearing you say this to me. Danny is a brilliant artist. You said yourself he's one of your brightest students. You want to spoil all that for him? And Carter... Carter is hanging on by a thread. Do you want to devastate him? - Are you suggesting I do nothing? - I'm not saying that. Give the kid a makeup exam or something. And I should compromise my integrity, the integrity of my class, for what exactly? What's your definition of integrity? Doesn't it include doing what you know is right for your fellow man? Oh, please. Oh, please? Robert, these kids are crazy about each other. They cheated. If I ignore this, what does it say about fairness? Fairness? No such thing. You found that... we all found that out in the '60s. So I should play Dolly Levy now? How did you and Nancy meet? That's irrelevant. Come on. How did you meet her? My freshman year at Columbia. Right. She was your French professor. 12 years older than you and a white woman. I know where you're going with this and I'm telling you it's just not... You didn't fail French, did you, Robert? Oh, and by the way, how is your French these days? One thing has nothing to do with the other. Nobody wanted to be called a racist. So whatever problems you had with the schoolwork, they let it pass. That wasn't fair, was it? Let me ask you something. Did you do all of your own French homework, Robert? Carter, would you have a seat, please? I asked you to stay because I was grading your essay and I couldn't help but notice it's a marked improvement over anything you've submitted so far. Well, I've been studying with an English tutor. It's helped out a lot. In fact, it's such a significant improvement, I'm forced to question its authorship. What? I'm certain you didn't write it. Danny wrote it and signed your name to it, didn't he? Did he say that to you? Come on, Carter! I'm not a complete fool. I know Danny's work and his style, and what's more, I know your work and your style. Why don't you just admit to it? No, I'm not going to admit to anything. You're a bright and gifted young man. I can't understand why you would risk this. What, did he threaten you or something? No. No, of course not. He was just falling too far behind. I wanted to help him pass. What's going to happen to him? Danny, do yourself a favor and stop worrying about what's going to happen to Carter and start worrying about what's going to happen to you. I had a long talk with Mr. Frank this morning. As you might have guessed, I don't much like Mr. Frank. And I certainly didn't appreciate what he had to tell me. So I'll ask you one simple question. Is it true? I got an English tutor like you said, but it was just still too hard. I wanted to swim in the finals... I warned you. No funny business on my squad. And when it came down to it, you didn't show me much out there, did you? Clean out your locker. Are you planning on avoiding me forever? Never talking to me again? Is that it? Or are we not far away from school yet? You asshole. They threw me off the team. How could you do that to me? Why didn't you just say you didn't write the thing? He already knew! Yeah, well, you know what? Just stay the hell away from me. I don't ever want to see you again. You're blaming this on me? The whole thing was your idea. Why didn't you just say you didn't write it? - That's all you had to do. - He already knew! Get lost. I told you to leave me the hell alone. You're up early, I see. I'm feeling motivated all of a sudden. What do you think? Yeah, it's just not the same when you change the scale, is it? What am I doing wrong? Wrong? Nothing, Danny. You just... You just don't know your subject yet. I don't know my subject? What does that mean? Well, it's obvious, really. I mean, you think you know it. And to some extent, you do. But only superficially. You know, you can get away with that with the smaller drawings. But this work is asking something more of you. The scale demands it. Demands what? Well, only you can answer that. I want to be able to come back to this piece again and again, and every time, I want to see something new in it. That'll come when you paint the essence of your subject. That thing that sets it apart from the rest of the world. Watch your head. Lift it up a little bit. Down. 1, 2... Carter? Route 2, we got a patient... Excuse me, Sir, are you family? Family only. I'm sorry. - What hospital are you taking him to? - Sagmore General. Get back to class. Come on, back to class. There's nothing to see here. It's okay. Are you still mad at me? They're done running tests. I had to wait around for them to poke and jab at me. Did they say when you can come home? I don't know. They didn't like my toxicology report. I won't be allowed to swim again. Anywhere. Come on. It's not the end of the world. How can you say that? I just meant that they have all kinds of medicine to control the seizures. The whole school knows. No one's going to care. Bullshit. They called social services, Danny. Don't you understand? You think I'm packing to go on fucking vacation? They're sending me to juvenile rehab. I wish I was dead. Don't say that! Don't touch me. I went from star athlete to freak of the week. You think Andy wants to do a story on me now? I know what it's like to feel different from everybody else. Believe me. Always worried about what people are saying. I know what it's like. You don't want to get messed up with me, kid. I'm trouble. You're the one piece I couldn't figure out. What are you talking about? You want me to have a piece of a jigsaw puzzle? What for? You probably do them, you know. I always had swimming. Nothing ever bothered me as long as I had swimming. Not my mom. Not my dad, not school. We'll figure it out. You'll see. You can make up English class in summer school. You still have swimming. I can't compete. No college is going to want me. I'm a fucking piece of shit! You're not a piece of shit. You're not. Don't... Don't fucking touch me. You should go. - When am I going to see...? - Go, Danny! Please, just go. Leave me alone. Love somebody else. You know, Henry never hurt me half as much as you. There's going to be an announcement in a moment coming over the PA. I want everyone to just stay in their seats. Good morning. Unfortunately, it's my responsibility... ...to share some tragic news with you. As some of you may be aware... ...Carter Melman was found dead early this morning. Hey, quiet! Quiet! A memorial service will be held at White Hill Chapel... ...tomorrow afternoon for those of you who wish to pay your respects. There are counselors and therapists available in the study hall. If anyone needs to talk, they are there now and will be there for the rest of the day. School will be closing at 1:00 pm. Once again... ...I encourage everyone who knew Carter to drop by the study hall and speak to one of the counselors. That's a joke, right? Mr. Frank? - That's bullshit! - Calm down. Talk to one of our counselors? Who made that up? Danny. - Who made that up? - Come on, Danny. It's a joke, right? Danny, sit down, please. Please say it's a joke. Please. Please say it's a... - Oh, my God! - Stay in your seats, please! Is he okay? Everyone just stay in your seats! I'm okay, Mom. You don't have to hover over me. You were up late again last night. I saw your light on. Nights are bad. You had nightmares when daddy died, too. Yeah, I remember. Do you think you'll ever love anybody the way that you loved daddy? No, baby. Never like daddy. Mom, I hurt so much inside. I'm all broken. I know, baby. Oh, Mom, I hurt so much. I know. I'll be right back. Just give me a minute. I'll be right back. I can't compete with him, you know? What are you talking about? I don't know why I ever bothered. He doesn't make mistakes. He doesn't grow old. He's never going to let you down you. I mean, how can anybody ever compete with that? Are you drunk? No, but I'm getting there. Hey, big night, huh? Big fucking night for Danny, everyone. Don't make a scene. I told you, I'm not going to paint him anymore. It doesn't even matter. You'll find some other way to obsess over him. I know you. What do you want from me? You want to lay me out on a slab? You want to cut me open? You want to look inside me? No, I want to... I want... I just want you to notice me. That's all. Treat me like you give a shit. Stop. I hate when you start feeling sorry for yourself. Me? You're the one living in your own little dream. He's dead, Danny. And I'm really sorry that it broke your heart. I am. But he's dead. And you can't paint him back to life. A few of us are going to go grab a bite to eat. And then I'm going home. But you should know I've put my all into this. Is this a peace offering? Could be. Or maybe a going away present. Who's going away? I don't know. But it's been three of us for too long. I thought you might be tired of painting ghosts.
