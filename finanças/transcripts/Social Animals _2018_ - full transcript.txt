I was in sixth grade, I think. I've had it since sophomore year. Actually, I think was 9 years old. All the kids just had Instagram and that's all they talked about. That's kind of the reason why I got to it too, like, "Oh, OK, I want to be like you guys." I don't think my parents have ever heard of Instagram. - I mean, now everyone is on it. - My feed was horrible. One time I posted something where I put my little brother in a dog kennel, I'm like, "This is funny, ha ha." No, that was the worst idea I've made ever. I usually have a bunch of photos I'm choosing from, not a bunch, about three. And then I post it with my feed, and I screenshot it. And then I delete it really fast just to see, like, how it looks with my other photos. I follow only hot chicks. I'm just joking, but probably most of the people I follow are hot chicks. If it doesn't look good, I'm like, "No, take it back to the drawing board and, like, start all over again." Sometimes I even go on the Internet, we look up, like, good captions for Instagram, like, It's that serious. How often do I look at it? Probably every hour. 14 times a day. Sometimes I even have to put an alarm for myself. There have been times where I thought, "Maybe I should delete my Instagram, you know, just because I don't really want to deal with it." But then I think, "What would I do with my life?" ♪ I wanna own the world You with me? ♪ I wanna have it all I'm gonna catch my breath ♪ You miss me I'll never leave you all ♪ I'm like sweet as candy So kiss me, try me ♪ I don't bite I don't stomp the ground ♪ I'm busy, I get what I like This level's unreachable, Skill is unteachable a' ♪ Tel me that You know the type ♪ My style is untouchable Entrepreneurial ♪ Better believe in the hype ♪ Bang, bang, to the beat Of my own drum, drum ♪ Bang, bang, To the beat of my drum ♪ Bang, bang, to the beat Of my own drum, drum ♪ Bang, bang, To the beat of my drum ♪ Bang, bang, to the beat Of my own drum, drum ♪ Bang, bang, To the beat of my drum ♪ Bang Yay! Yay! Wooh! Ey! My friends Sarah and Grace were together, we all had a sleepover, and they were like, "Oh, my gosh, Kaylyn you should get Instagram." And I was like, "No." I was like, "My mom really doesn't want me to have, like, any social media things." They were like, "Just download it, just do it, like, super quickly", "like, it doesn't matter, she'll never know." Whatever, and I was like, "OK." Then I posted a picture of us three, and so all these people started following me that were their friends. And then I did a photo shoot with this guy named David Hoffman, a really good dance photographer, and he had a ton of Instagram followers. I started posting those photos, and I got so many followers. I just pressed, "public" so that they could all follow me, and it just kept going, and going and going. Once I hit 50k, I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I'm halfway to 100k." - Is that good? - Yeah. - Do you want to see it? - Yes. My mom's like, "Kaylyn." She's like, "I told you to keep private." And I was like, "I know." But I was like, "I didn't want to look through all the people that were trying to follow me." She was like, "OK, well, make sure you just post, like... don't post too much about your life." That's actually so funny. She kind of, like, started to have fun with it. She was like, "You should post more stuff." And I was like, "What?" I was like, "I should? You were the one who told me not to have Instagram." And she was like, "Yeah, but it's kind of like a network, it's kind of like you..." "Like, it benefits you, kind of." And so, it's kind of like a business, I feel like. - How does that look? - Looks good, let's take another one. - OK. - OK. Let's do it again. Wooh! Wooh! Mun We're going to wrap around, to right here, and then we're going to walk along right here. It's like a hallway right there, and the door is open to get in. I was thinking, like, just in case, like an escape route, if we needed to, we could exit somewhere right here. Go right, go right, go right. We're the young teenagers known as millennials, also known as the Instagram Generation. We are the co-creators of digital era. Boom, I got it. Bro, that snap is fire, nobody's ready for that. My first time ever picking up a camera, was a broken iPhone 4. I would be on Instagram 24/7 trying to figure out a way to build my following. I was just blown away like, "Wow, this is, like," a thing, that people photograph? "Like, this is amazing." Urban exploration is very popular these days, so I photograph it as fast as I can. Then I take, like, 10, 15 minutes and enjoy the view still, and then I'm like, "OK time to go, leave now." We're good, let's go, let's go now. I'm always sitting there, you know, balancing out risk and reward. Like, is the risk worth the reward? Oh, man, that was scary shit. We're going to see that bull-ride right here. This guy who's getting on him don't take him lightly. No, sir. Alright, jump on. Like I said, number three, cowboy. Slide and ride! Praise to God! Look at that cowboy! Get it! Oh, son! Man, oh, man. Man, oh, man. - Wooh! - Give that cowboy a big round of applause right there. Literally, social media is like a job. Posting pictures, making sure you're keeping up on following people back. Your boyfriends, or your girlfriends or your best friends and stuff. I don't really like it, but I keep doing it. So... Do you know the rules of Instagram, of how you can't post two pictures a day? You can't do that, mm-mm. And you can't post two selfies next to each other, don't do that either, OK? On weekdays, you should post around, like, nine-thirty, that's when you'll get the most likes. And then on weekends, it's like ten-thirty 'cause, you know, weekends are later at night. That's really embarrassing, I know that. I like looking at people's adventures and, like, where people travel, so it's like, "Oh, goals, gosh, I wish I were them." They're so happy and I'm here sitting on my couch eating ramen noodles, you know? Yeah. I kind of live in the country. A lot of people would say it's pretty boring, which it is kind of boring, but the farm life is kind of nice, you know, dirt-biking and, like, have a bunch of room to be able to, like, have campfires and stuff. It's very, mellow lifestyle. I was super tomboyish, I always hung out with the dudes, I was always the girl, like, in the creek, like, messing with frogs and stuff. And all the other girls would be like, "Ew, no, it's gross." But I liked it, I don't know, just how I was. What was the most trouble you guys have ever gotten together as kids? We might not be able to use this, 'cause I'm not trying to... I got an image to maintain, alright? I'm not trying to, not trying to get embarrassed so. Yeah, we was... basically we was young, we was about 12,13. It was about, like, 15 of us, we was running around tagging up, graffiti and all that. We was going around tagging up, my friend, Michael, he stole a box of donuts, and then he's running from the cops. - I remember Michael, he stole a box of donuts. - He's running from the cops and he ran back to get his donuts. So that was funny. And Humza, out of all 15 or 12 of us, Humza was the only one that got away. - I think he was on roller-blades. - Oh, snap, I forgot about that whole part. But that was funny though, Humza was the only one that got away. I never really fit in with any of the crowds that were in my area, I grew up in the Projects. A lot of the kids I hung around, they started doing graffiti, and, you know, I was like, "Oh, I want to fit in." So I started doing graffiti. They started shoplifting, so I was like, "Oh, I want to fit in." So I started shoplifting. You know, anything I could do to stay within the crowd. We 're very similar, but at the same time different, like... I don't know. Humza just has different interests in different things. Like, as far as skateboarding, photography, different type of women, different lifestyle. I do music, I rap. People would see us and they would never think we is brothers. I thought I'd probably be like a gang member. I was like, "Oh, When I go to jail." I was like, "And I get out, people will respect me more." You know. I was very small-minded. When I started hanging around the skater kids, I kind of found a way out of, like, the ghetto. It was like a life-changing moment for me. It showed me that there's more to, like, my daily routine than the four, five blocks that I grew up in. Humza just kept advancing and growing and, and doing all types of stuff with skateboards, so... I was just like, "Aight, you got it, Humza. You go do the skateboard thing." I thought he was going to get famous off of skateboarding, but then he came out of nowhere with photography. There's a bunch of us that hung out together, took photos on the ground. Some of them didn't like me. And then I would see when they shared on social media, that they went shooting. I'm just like, "Why wasn't I invited?" You know? Their reason was, like, "Oh, Humza, you're a shadow figure. If I take a picture, you literally wait 'til I'm done and you take the same exact picture. " I'm like, " Well, you are the better photographer. You have a better eye. If you take the picture, I want to compete with you "in a way, and become more experienced." And they didn't like that, so they stopped hanging out with me. I was surfing the web, and I came across this video of two guys climbing a tower in, like, Shanghai or whatever. "A light-bulb, like, went off in my head, I'm like, "No one is doing that here "in New York City." Like, again, I'm following over 2,000 accounts, never seen anything like it. So, I'm like, "I got an idea. I'm going to run with it." A couple of days later, I climbed a bridge. Oh, shit. That adrenaline rush that went through me felt so, so good. The thrill was so much fun, that it made the reward seem even greater than it actually was. When I saw those perspectives of being on top of the bridge and I'm just like, "Man, imagine that from, like, the Greensboro Bridge." A new idea was born, "Shoot from the top of all the bridges you can in New York City." As time went by, more people became interested in my work. People were like, "Oh, look at these perspectives he's showing", like, tagging their friends, like, "Awesome photo." Oh, shit. My grandma doesn't know what Instagram is thankfully. She'd probably say, "Who do you think you are climbing these buildings and standing on the edge?" She's like, "You'll fall and hurt yourself." I could just hear her saying it now. She'd probably hit me with her back-scratcher. Like, "Whack!" then she'll be like, "Pick it up and bring it back to me, now." And I'd get hit again. Oh, man. Every photographer out there, they would say, "Risking your life for a photograph is not worth it." "And I said," Well, this is the only way that I can showcase New York differently, "and that most people would not dare to do." Dude, this is tight. Hold on, stay right there. That's, like, a boundary I'm willing to cross. I was like, "This is it. You found it." You know, like, "You can finally show New York City differently." And that's how Humza Deas found his craft. - Do you want to, like, sit right there, and I'll take it here? - Yeah. I want, like, I want everybody to see, like, the color. - OK. - Do you want, like, the carpet... How much of it do you want in the frame? Everything. As much as you can get. OK. Ready? One, two, three. Perfect. OK. Do you want to see it? OK. Yeah. - Oh, yeah, that's cute. - Yeah, I like this one. In my point of view, a celebrity is kind of somebody who's famous, and somebody who lives, like, like, a great life, who's, like, always in the spotlight, and always, like, loving their life, like, wealthy, like, rich, famous, nice cars, nice house, nice clothes, nice everything. I would say, like, "what color should I paint my walls?" - Ready to go. - OK, posted it. - I'll go like it right now. - OK. In my point of view, I personally don't think of myself as famous or a celebrity. Grey, rainbow, lavender, white, sea blue, grey and white, - JK, light blue, light blue, dark grey, sky blue. - Oh, my God. You can't say she's not famous because... I don't know. It just seems so weird, because she's just Kaylyn to me. - That's... yeah, like all my other friends. They're like, like, my friends always say they're like, "Oh my God, we saw, like", some girls at the mall. They were freaking out that we were friends with you." and I was like, "it's just me." - 687 likes in two minutes. - Yeah! Ever since I was little, I've always wanted to be a Victoria's Secret model, and, like, be a Victoria's Secret Angel. That's one of the biggest things I've ever wanted to do in modeling, but my dad's 5'9", and my mom's 5'3". I'm not going to be like, "OK, let's take, like, a pill to make me taller." Like, That's not gonna happen. I always loved fashion, like, no matter what. Like, my mom loves fashion. Like, if you see her closet, it's crazy. I talked to my dad about it in the car one day when we're going to school, and I was like, "I love fashion and I really want to do a successful line." My dad was like, "Well, I think you're a little young right now", but maybe when you get to, like, having a little bit more of a following "like 500K, then, like, we'll see." She's working on that number. I mean, she tells me, she wants to get into the millions. She doesn't want to just be on runway modeling clothes, she wants to be the nucleus of the fashion, you know what I mean? She wants to be the brand. - Oh, my gosh. - My dad's a really hard worker. He owns car dealerships, and he owns quite a few of them. - This one was well fed. - That's disgusting. By the time he was 20, he was a millionaire. He was, like, an example for me to do those things and be super, like, determined and be successful with everything I do. What's your relationship with Kaylyn like? Um, you know, I'm obviously her father, but like I said, I'm also... I mean, she talks to me about business, she's been around me. She's heard all these conversations, she's heard all these hours of phone calls I've had and all that stuff. So she's picked up on it pretty good. Biggest business tip I'll give you is, have the guts to try it. That's the first one. So many people, they talk themselves out of it and then they over-analyze. What they call it in golf? They call it. "Paralysis through analysis." That's what happens to a lot of people. But have the guts to do it. Worst comes to worst, you can always do it again. - That's true. - OK. We've got to find another... My dad always takes everything into business perspectives, which is good and smart, but sometimes he just needs to calm down a little bit. She's had offers before about getting into this clothing business stuff for modeling, and she's been asked to do a lot of different clothing lines. Finally, I told her, I says, "You gotta get somebody who knows the ins and outs of the business." I understand business, but I don't understand the clothing business. You come up with something trendy, and it'll work, it'll be great. This stuff has got to be good, it's got to be good quality, it's got to be affordable, you want to make sure that everybody can afford it. And then you want to make sure... the big key ingredient is you want to merchandise it. You want to make sure advertising... Advertising sells everything. - Instagram. - Once you advertise... He travels all of the time. It's, like, not a big deal when he leaves. It's, kind of, almost good to have a break from him. Not like that, but, like, good 'cause he's, like, super... not like... I don't know how to explain it. Now, the Tupperware, why I like the Tupperware is I can give it a good shake like this. Then we're going to pop it right into the refrigerator, and bingo! We start marinating it. You can come up to a girl nowadays and just be like, "Hey, I saw your post on Instagram." And then she'd be like, "Oh, really?" and all of a sudden, it's like this flirty interesting thing. I'm shy, so, like, I'm not strong enough to go and just ask her for it. Sol probably will ask her friends for their Instagram name or something like that. And then I'll, like, just stalk her friend's page until I find their page. And then I'll just, like, follow them in the end. There's a thing called DM, which is direct messaging. And I have direct messaged a girl before, and sometimes they're just, like, not online, and you were just freaking out the whole day. You're just like, "What did I just do?" and you're just, "Oh!" When I hear my parents talk about how, like, things were back then, like, my dad was like, "Oh, yeah, you had to, like, impress a girl in 10 minutes" or they're going to walk away. But now you see the pictures of the person, you go on their page, you're like, "Oh, they're kind of cute." You like it, and then you like another one and you just keep on liking. And then they start liking, and then, like, next thing you know, you guys are, like, "talking". Because it'll tell you if they read it or not, and they didn't, so I'm kind of, like, checking it every two seconds. Just like, "Did they read it? No. OK, we're good." One guy that liked my picture and I liked his picture. And then he followed me, I followed him. And then I spammed him, and he spammed me. And then, like, we started talking, and then I ended up dating him for a year and six months. And then he lived in New York, so then I ended up going to a competition in New York. And then I met him. And I finally met him after, like, a year and a half. People don't really date anymore, like, they just, like, DM each other on Instagram, they start talking, then they usually just... I don't know. They don't date. But definitely, yeah. I've tried to, um, reach out to some people, but always nervous about it. You guys ready for this? Don't fall. Yes, that one looks really good. Yeah! Every relationship I was in in high school was stressful, she saw me getting hurt, so I'm sure she learned from watching me go through cycles. Smile everyone. A lot of what she told me to, like, expect from high school was that girls are gonna be mean, guys are gonna be mean, girls are gonna get jealous and be mean, a lot of stuff just about guarding my heart and, like, being cautious with boys. OK, uh, two blueberry, please. I was like, "I'm just going to be there whenever she needs me, you know?" Even if she makes mistakes and some guy breaks her heart or whatever. Like, I'm just gonna be there regardless. Sensor. Look, look at this, if I put it on there. What's the craziest thing you've ever seen on Instagram? I thought this was kind of funny. I was getting, like, a bunch of followers. You know, that's just kinda how I got connected in school, was through Instagram. It was kinda just how I got people's numbers, like, mainly guys. I've had, like, six guys DM me literally just with, um, these two words, "Booty pics". And then a question mark. And I don't even know the guys. And, like, I block them immediately, it scares me. And I'm like, "What is wrong with people?" - So you've never done it? - Oh, I have. Boys came into the scene, and it was, kind of this interest, they knew what the boundary was, they knew that technically you're not allowed to date till you're 16. That was the... that's the rule. Michael, he was in my biology class, and he was, like, he's super outgoing, and always made funny jokes and one day, he asked my friend, Olivia for my number so that he could text me about the quiz. We talked for a long time, it was like three months. I think she had asked us about dating and we were like, "We're not, we're not OK with that." We basically were dating, like, we held hands in the hall, and, like, like, you know, the typical relationship status, but he never asked me officially to be his girlfriend because I wasn't allowed to, you know, have a boyfriend, so. We try to be wise and smart as parents, but we have awoken a sleeping giant. And a lot of it was not knowing the boundaries with boys. I was just sitting at home one day, like, scrolling through my Instagram feed, and I came across this Instagram account with the name of Humza Deas. "So one day I posted, like, an Instagram app photo, "Oh, I'm in Queens, anyone out that wants to shoot?" And it was like 1 a.m. And Demid was like, "Hey, I'm around the area, would love to meet up." He's like, "I know a couple things too." I'm just like, "sure, I'm lonely out here, just want to shoot? Just come keep me company." I had, like, biked all the way to Roosevelt Island, even got hit by a car on the way there because I was, like, rushing. It just, like, dented my wheel. So, like, I had to, like, hide my bike in a bush, walk the rest of the way to Roosevelt Island. Met up with Humza. And he's like, "So you're Humza Deas, you're the bridge climber?" and I'm just like, "Uh, yeah, I'm Humza." He's like, "So What are you doing out here at 1 a.m. right now?" Did you just climb this bridge?" I was like, "No." But secretly I was scouting it out. He's like, "Cool. Let's go up, let's go up." I'm just like, "I have no idea who this kid is." For some reason I said, sure. We're on the top, and, you know, like, I'm trying to be very secretive. There's a lot of traffic still going on. This kid, like, puts his camera on one side of the bridge. And he puts, like, a self-timer. He goes to the other side, and does, like, an emotional pose, like leaning on a gate. And then, like, his flash just pops off, "Pow!" And I'm just like, "What is wrong with you?" I'm like, "Dude, stop using your flash." He's like, "Alright, just one more, one more." I'm like, "No, man." I was like, "No flash." He's like, "Dude, I bought us some Red Bull. Let's chill up here, cheers. " I'm just like, " We've got to go. You've been using your flash." He's like, he's like, "Let's just chug the Red Bull." I'm like, whatever. So we, like, shotgunned the Red Bull. And then we get down, and I was just, like, freaked out. I was like, "Alright, man, I'm done for the night." And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, before you go, like, I've got this cool subway map of old stations, we should try to get to them." I'm like, "Man, this game got so much larger." For, like, the next three or four days. We went, like, full nocturnal and just non-stop went on a bunch of, like, missions. So, That's the active train shocks. If the train does come, hug that wall. Third rail, watch the third rail, dude. We pretty much shot for, like, a month straight together. Got, like, four to five hours of sleep each day. "And we were just like," meet up again around the night time and, like, go out to shoot." Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, shit, come on, come on, come on. Fuck, dude, we're so stuck in here. We went to Instagram meetups, we sent each other things that inspired us, you know, like, we were feeding each other food for thought. That was when we became, like, pretty close buds. I woke up one morning with 4,000 plus new followers on, uh, Instagram, and, just like, over 30 text messages saying, "Hey, wake-up." Like, you're in big trouble. I can't believe you would go and do something like that." It hit social media a little after seven o'clock this morning. A tourist noticed something odd. The two American flags that usually fly atop both Brooklyn Bridge towers were gone. Replaced by two mysterious white flags. I was accused of doing that because people knew me as a person who climbs bridges. It's a huge feat to scale this bridge and to get up on top of that flagpole to put white flags there. Who could have done that? That is the key question. A Reporter was like, "Hey, I see you're getting a lot of heat for this." Would you like to come on air and explain that you had nothing to do with this?" So I said, yeah. Because I was very afraid that cops were going to see these articles and want to arrest me. My gut tells me it's one person that I know of. I haven't met him, but he's popular. He's not naming names, but says there's a subculture of hundreds of bridge climbers who almost always go up in groups. And he says it's not any of the people currently claiming through social media to have done it. It just completely backfired-People were like, "Oh, Humza, you just wanted 15 minutes of fame. You exposed a subculture." Another artist heard about the interview, and he was really bitter about it because he also wants to climb bridges and he wants to do something similar. Now authorities have been alerted as to what their whole strategy is. Demid was like, "Don't worry about them-I talked to one of them-". He's like, "They're not going to do anything." I was like, "Alright, cool. Thanks for putting in a word for me." He had my back for a certain amount of time. The rules go unspoken, but they will be spoken to you if you break those rules. The whole urban exploration community started sending me death threats. "People were like," if I ever see this kid in, like, an abandoned building or on a rooftop, I'll push him off or I'm going to break his head through a window." The following two weeks, I would always have to look over my shoulder and I was just, like, a disaster mentally and physically. Me and my friend Chloe had just gotten in a fight. I was talking to Michael, my boyfriend, and I was just like, "I don't know if I really want to be friends with her anymore." He had become really good friends with Chloe, which I was fine with, but they... I felt they almost became more than friends. Michael, being an awesome guy that he is, took the screenshots of my text and sent it to Chloe. Then so Chloe saw that and was like, "I thought we were best friends, "blah, blah, blah." And then I fell asleep, and woke up to a bunch of text messages from Michael and he's like, "What's all this I hear about you cheating on me?" Girls from our school or... And Chloe spread rumors about me cheating on Michael, and I was really confused. "What? What's going on?" I was like, "if you're not going to believe me", and you're going to believe, like, random girls over me, "we shouldn't date." So that's when the harassing started. It was just constant. Every day there would be like 50 notifications on my phone, calling me a slut and a hoe. I would understand if I was a hoe, but, like, I didn't do anything. I ignored it for a long time, but it eventually, like, it actually started taking a toll on me. My sister like... was like, "Just say something back." She won't even tell mom and dad, like, what was going on, on social media 'cause it was, like, just horrible. It almost was like a game for everyone. There was people on my side, and there was people on Michael's side. And Emma kind of, you know... she fought back. She said things she shouldn't have said and I think that kept the fire going. I went to my lunch table and Chloe came up and she said, "Why are you sitting here?" Then she called me a bitch. And then I was like, "This is my lunch table. These are my friends." And, like, four of the girls that were on my lunch table said, "No, we're not." And then, so I got up and ran to the bathroom and, like, cried. It just got worse and worse. Horrible things. Words that, that you just wouldn't expect, especially out of a Christian school. A few girls did tell me to go kill myself, and, like, I didn't know how to react to that. It kind of took me, like, by surprise. I'm like, "Someone actually just told me to, like, go take my life, because of rumors." I swear none of them would have said that to my face, but since they could say it over a screen, you know, they just did. I, like, ran into school, took my last exam, then ran out. And as soon as I got in the car, I was like, "Mom, I'm done." and she said, "I know." And so I didn't come back here the next year. Alright, guys, we're gonna go, uh, three at a time. So first group, thank you for being ready, 31-152. Um, and just a reminder, you only will do the dance twice in front of us before we judge you. So those are your only two opportunities to really show us what you've learned today, what you have, what you can bring to the team. OK, we're ready. Music. Good. Everything in life is competitive. It doesn't matter what it is. Acting is competitive, dancing is competitive, modeling is competitive. I don't really get affected by much. And so, like, I feel like that's a good thing 'cause, like, I'm just, like, unstoppable. I've always been pretty confident, like, ever since I was little. I feel like if you have, like, more of a confidence in you, then you're going to do better in, like, everything. And I guess that helps me a lot for, like, school, and dance, and acting, and modeling, and everything, 'cause, like, confidence is, like, key, major key. Awesome. Thank you, guys, Switch lines. One more time. I'll give you a second to breathe. Let me see your toes. - You have a little tiny... - I have shrimp toes. - They're so gross. - No, everyone hates their toes. - I hate my toes. - I've never met anyone who's like, "My toes are so cute." Everyone's like, "Ew." I've been in fashion for 10 years now. And so I've been designing and styling, and I know everything about fashion. When we met Jazmin, my mom was like, "Oh, my gosh, I love her style." And so did I, of course. Ooh. That was doing something, that was... That might have been it, hold on. She has a huge passion and interest in fashion, and so... It was just, like, a no-brainer. We were like, "OK, we want to do this." I think the two of them are going to be a great team. One does design, Kaylyn can do the modeling. And our girl's got a following too, and, uh... I think the two of them teaming up, I think they can do nothing but make it, you know, and make it big. - Gigi is so pretty. - I know I love her. - It's ridiculous. - I know. Jazmin was like, "Let's, vamp up your Instagram. Let's make it cooler." Her dad had mentioned that he wanted to see that platform get a little bit bigger before going full out with everything. We started talking about her look on Instagram, like, her photos. You look little. Like really little. - You don't look like that anymore. - Yeah. We decided to work with a photographer, Ravi, who has an amazing Instagram account. Just, kind of like, a different vibe than the typical shoots that Kaylyn has been working on. You started Instagram a little while ago? Yeah. Like, When I was like around 12 or 13. 12 or 13? You've kind of crafted an image for yourself? Or do you feel like you're just posting what you feel in the moment? - Like, how strategic are you? - Mm. - I feel like sometimes... - I don't think you overthink it. Yeah, I don't overthink it, but I think a little bit about it. Like, I feel like everybody thinks about what they're posting instead of just, like, throwing anything out there, 'cause you have a certain image so you want people... You know what I mean? Like, you want to keep that image of who you are. Alright. You guys ready to rock and roll? - Yeah. - Let's do it. Kaylyn, you're slaying. Work. Gorgeous, yes. You might get attacked by a rattlesnake, but this is so Fifth Harmony worth it. Whatever your thing is that you are drawn to, there's probably somebody on Instagram doing it and making you feel like, "Man, that's the life." Like, That's what I want to be doing." Ready 1, 2, s. A very common comment that I get on the pictures would probably be, "So pretty." Or, "Love hair." Or, "Such pretty eyes." Or stuff like that, or, "Hot." I don't know. I feel like that's interesting, like, that people, like, think so highly of me and they don't even know me. People consuming all these stories all the time. The only downside is if they don't have a reality-check on that curation, or knowing that these people are... Nobody's perfect. Like, everybody's human still. Lips together a little bit more. Good. And then chin, yeah. Give me a long neck. Good, beautiful. Like, it doesn't matter at the end of the day how many likes or anything you get, it's all Monopoly money. What matters is the opportunities it affords you, the means to an end. I feel happy, like, when I get a lot of likes. I'm just like, "Oh, yay!" I kind of have a rule: If I don't have exactly, like, one like per minute up to an hour or so, if I don't have at least, like, 60 or 70 likes in an hour, like, I have to delete it. I'm just like, "No." It's a bit embarrassing, like, if they see your photo, and you only have, like, 18 likes on it. I've bought likes. I still do. So, like, I buy likes to show, "Hey, I'm a cool person." You can take a picture with someone, and then you guys post the exact same thing but its secretly a competition on who gets the most- Who gets the most likes. - Yes. - Who gets the most likes. Instagram opened the horizon for pettiness from my generation. Especially the school we were in. - Oh, Lord. - Yes. Our middle school was something else. It's kind of like a rating scale because popularity is a very, very fluid thing in high school. Every time I post a bikini picture, I get lots of comments. So, when I'm sad, I do post a bikini picture. Instagram gives you numbers, it gives you, like, statistics on if your life matches up to someone else's life. People want to actually hang out with me now. Now that I have... I post the pictures I post and I have the following that I have. People with the large audiences told their audiences, "Oh, no one, like, talk" to Humza because he technically snitched and said these things." At that time, I lost like 1,500 followers. I was angry, I was frustrated. So I became really uninspired and I was just like, "I might as well go back to skateboarding." "At least they like me there." A reporter for New York Magazine reached out, he's like, "Don't worry, I'm totally not going to screw you over." I'd love to sit down and talk to you, and kind of, show people that you're not just a snitch or whatever they labeled you, and that you're a photographer "taking these beautiful images." So I said, "Maybe this is a shot at redeeming myself." You know, like, "What do I have to lose? I already lost everything." I walked by a newspaper stand and I saw my photo and I was like, "That's my photo." I, like, took it off the stand and I showed the guy, So I was like, "That's my photo, that's my feet." I thought it was awesome. I was like, "Outlaw of Instagram." I was like, "Oh, That sounds sick, you know, they make me sound like a badass." I Googled my name, which is pretty cocky, and then there's more articles just dropping by the hour, and I'm just like, "Whoa, this is, like, going big." One of my friends, his dad was in a taxi and he's like, "My dad's listening to you on NPR." And I'm like, "What's NPR?" He's like, "National Public Radio." And I'm like, "What?" Humza Deas is a pretty ambitious 17 year old. So he isn't that impressed by his Instagram following, but he should be. Girls love badasses and they saw me, like, scaling to these heights. Just like, "Oh, he's fearless. Oh." Just like... They were just like... It was like a panty-dropper when they saw what I was doing. What's up? I'm here with the illest of the illest. Well, I'm here with the illest of the illest. I had 9,800 followers, woke up one morning, had 14k, then over the course of a month, 75k. I don't really care about followers too much because it's just, like, you know It's just, like, a number. I mean, if you're, like, you know, trying to, like, sort of, like, market yourself, bigger following count, like, helps you out with that. But, like, personally, like, it doesn't really matter to me. This is one of my proudest photos. I love the pants and shoes I was wearing. It was a dope, like, setting, I was like, "Oh man", "I got to snap a feet picture today." And I got one of my best images out of it. This was actually shot in New Jersey, not New York, it's called The Show Goes On. This was one of the paranoias I had of my art gallery, no one showing up, being a disaster. That's why I wanted to include it in the gallery. - Wow, Humza, I am so proud of you. - For real, seriously. - So proud of you, bro. - Thanks. I appreciate you stopping by. - He gave me my first iPhone. - Yeah, taken with my iPhone. I took my first photo, like, photography photo - with the iPhone he gave me. - That's crazy. He charged me $50, I only had 40, I only had 40, and I was like, "Yo, I'll pay you back 10." And he was like, "You good, you good." And I'm like. "Yo, thanks. I appreciate it." Hey. Uh. So, Everyone, I greatly appreciate every single one of you to come here. Some of you are probably here because you saw the New York Mag article or whatever article you saw. They called me an, "Outlaw Instagrammer." or, "Daredevil Instagram photographer." Uh, I do not want to be labeled that, I am skateboarder, photographer. That is who Humza Deas is. And I am Humza Deas. I greatly appreciate all of you being here. Thank you. The biggest thing for girls like me being a high school student, is girls looking at their ex's Instagram and seeing how happy they are with their new girlfriend. You're scrolling through Instagram, your friend's over there, eating some food or whatever, sitting in bed together. And you click on your ex, but you're usually blocked on your ex, so Your friend looks up his name for you, and then you stalk it on your friend's name. And then you see pictures of him hanging out with his friends, and hanging out with new girls and being crazy. And then you start crying because it makes you sad. So that's the daily dose of being a girl. After leaving the school I just wanted to move on. I wanted to not have to see anything on Instagram. I didn't want to deal with it. ♪ There was a time When I was alone ♪ Nowhere to go And no place to go alone ♪ My only friend Was the man on the moon ♪ And even sometimes He would go away, too ♪ Then one night, As I closed my eyes ♪ I saw a shadow flying high ♪ He came to me with The sweetest smile... I deleted all the pictures and, like, all the memories I had with my classmates and all friends I've made over the two years of being there. I made my account private so that no one could, like, see my Instagram. And I blocked 100% of the ninth grade. ♪ Peacefully My feet hit the sand I ended up going to Springboro. I was super nervous just because going from a 90 per grade to like a 1000 per grade is a huge difference. I was stressed, but excited. I kind of get to start over. I took it slow. I didn't want to interact with anyone really. There are more kids, you can fly under the radar, and she kind of went in there. She said, "I'm keeping my head down." I'm staying out of trouble. Less drama. "You know, it would be best." A t my old school, I was one of few, like, girls that looked OK. Like, I don't know how to say that without being nice. And at Springboro, lam not even close to, like, what other girls are. I don't constantly think, like, "Oh, I wish I were better looking." It's more like, I look at another girl and I'm like, "I should work out, I should eat healthier." It's almost like jealousy. It literally is jealousy. It's like, "I wish I looked like that." And you compare yourself and you're like, "Her thighs" are thinner than mine. She has a thigh gap. "Her face is prettier than mine. She has a nice jaw line." Just stuff like that constantly goes in your mind. I kind of just was always worried about, "Am I ever going to, like, fit in here? Is this really, like, a good idea for me to be at this school?" But the more that people got to know me and they would post pictures with me, the more I would get, like, involved. It was like a new, just new world, kind of. There was a kid named Nick. Well, my friend Haley was friends with him, and he FaceTimed her 'cause they're friends. And he answered it, and then he saw me next to her and was like, "Who's that?" And she was like, "My best friend, Emma." And then he was like, "OK." Then that night, he DM-ed me and he was like, "Hey." And then he asked for my number and we just started texting as friends at first, and then we kind of liked each other. Our first date, we went on a study date and ate Sushi. I just kind of fell for him because he was so funny. And, like, I don't know why he fell for me, probably because I'm so funny, but... We started hanging out more. We would go to the park and, like, climb trees and, like, walk around and spend time with his family. And I was just like, "Hey, I'm actually really into you." Like that kind of situation. It's like, uh, when you're in a relationship and the guy posts a picture with you, that's very affirming, like, knowing that you're actually the only one. Because if there was another girl, she would definitely see that pic. So it's like, check off the list. I mean, it's true. It's sad to say, but it's true. ♪ We're going to the beach ♪ We're going on a trip In our favorite rocket ship ♪ Going to the beach, Little Einstein We going to the beach. We going to the beach. Does Kaylyn have a boyfriend? She's got... She's got friends that she goes around with, you know. She... I don't... Like I said, as per se, I don't think it's... You know, at least I don't know of it, you know. She's got a couple of friends. I mean, she got one friend in particular. She's got... but you know, like I said, I don't know the extent. She's 15 years old. We've known each other for three and a half years but we've been dating for like 10 months. Max did the impossible, he broke the friend zone. You did. At one point, I think I said, "So, Max", is that your girl?" And he went, "Yeah." I said, "Well, that's great." He's like, "Yeah." Like, "OK." Is she always on her phone? 100%, like she's never not on it. - Are you on your phone less? - Yeah, like, I'll lose my... - No. - No, when I lose my phone, I don't care. - Like, if she lost her phone she would, like... - No, I wouldn't. - Yes, she would. - You have to go on with life. When her phone dies, she's like, "Oh, my God." ♪ I seen your girl post her BM ♪ So I hit her in her DM ♪ All eyes, yeah I see 'em You've heard the DM song, I'm sure. I mean, a lot... You haven't heard the DM song? Where it's like, ♪ Down in the DM's It go down, it go down ♪ It go down in the DM, It go down in... So it's basically a song about, like, a guy hitting up a girl in the DMs and, like, people... everyone knows that song now. Well, you don't. ♪ Or FaceTime me that pussy If it's cool Guys asking for nudes of girls is getting so common and it's so illegal. I'm talking, the seventh graders that ride my bus, and like, "Oh, did you see her nudes last night, so-and-so to send these. "I sent her this." And it's getting really serious, and it's, it's not OK. ♪ You take my love for granted I just don't understand it I don't know! Oh, "W". - Why is it so close? - Oh, my God, that's so... Let's take pictures. This one. Look how good this one is. - Yeah, you should post that. - Send them all to me or airdrop it. I can't, like, really control what people say. And so, my mom's sort of helping me with my Instagram. Deleting, like, the bad comments that were on there. I understand, like, a hormonal boy just commenting on a picture. But I've seen, like, older men with a wife and kid commenting and I'm like, "Oh, yeah." We got it under control. I don't think consciously of, like, how I am. I just wear what I feel like I want to wear. And, like, most of my friends wear the same thing as me. I just have a different body shape than them. Ooh, I like this one. That's how I came out of my mom's stomach. Like, I can't really do... Like, you know what I mean? I can't do anything, just, like, about it. If you put makeup on me, I'm going to look older of course, but I love those pictures, so I'm not going to not post them. You know what I mean? - Uh, no. - No. - I look awful. - No. - No. - Oh, my... - No way. - No. I hardly post selfies 'cause... Oh, my goodness. It's so hard to post the perfect selfie. - So hard to take... - But, when you do post selfies, they are so nice. They are so nice, if you have that perfect selfie, but, oh, goodness, it's so hard. I need lessons on selfies 'cause like... I took a shower. I blow-dried my hair. I curled my hair. I did my makeup. And it took about an hour and a half just to get ready for like, a selfie. There's part of me that's like, OK, I don't take pictures, I don't put them on Instagram, because I feel like I don't look like this guy on Instagram who has, like, this six-pack. He's a model and all that. I usually take down the brightness a little bit 'cause I don't want it too bright, 'Cause then it makes my skin look oily. There's this one called Facetune where like, if you don't... If you have, like, acne or something, you can, like, smooth it out or, - like, something. Yeah, so, - I've never heard of that one. I know a lot of people use that and I use it sometimes. I had this dress on. I decided to, like, kind of erase the sides of my waist a little bit. So I could adjust it and make it look more slimmer. I don't use Facetune personally 'cause they come out looking like, really, really fake, or like, you alter your face, like, one side's, like, half cut off. I don't know. A lot can go wrong with that. And then I realized like people could tell. So, I think that was the craziest and, like, the most embarrassing, and, like, never again done in my life. There's a lot of pressure making sure that you look absolutely perfect in every single photo. - Saige, what's up? - 'Sup, brother. Nothing much. Just getting a good start to the morning. Once I realized people were willing to pay money for my art, I was like, oh, well, now I have to look at this as a... in a brand point of view. Like, how can I market myself? - Humzilla's. - Yes, sir. Humza Deas knows, no two perspectives in New York City are the same. The Humzilla follow suit. Brands reach out to me because they like my work, but then what really seals the deal is that they're able to target another audience by using my social media. Out of the blue, Adidas reached out to me to work on the Yeezy Season One campaign. I was like, no way. Kanye is like, my favorite rapper right now. You know, I was, like, being a fanboy. That was like my first paying gig. She said, "Hey, like, the most we're willing to offer you" "is like 10,000." And I was like, "Like, $10,000? There any way you could pay me in cash? 'Cause I don't have a bank account." She's like, "We cannot cash you out on this." I'm just like, "So what do I have to do?" She's like, "You have to get a bank account or something." You know, I was, like, 17, this, like, super hyped kid sitting in a chair, like all sweaty, has, like, a skateboard. The bank teller started asking, like, "How'd you get 10 grand?" And like, I'm black, so like, you can tell on the back of his head and he's like, "Is it drug money?" I'm just like, "No, no, no, I do photography. I like got to shoot for Kanye, and all that." As soon as I created that account, I called my friend. He's like, "The first thing you should purchase with that debit card", it should be your flight to Dubai, and I'm like, "Yeah, let's do it." Wheels up baby." I was finally leaving New York City for the first time ever in my life. That awoken, like, the wander bug in me. There's a whole world out there. I was like, "Oh, I got to go here, I got to go here", I got to go there." All the money I make through photography gets used for traveling. I got that on film. Wooh. OK. That was terrifying. I was happy because I was gaining an audience and people were finally appreciating my work, but at the same time, I'm looking over my shoulder because these kids don't like what I'm doing. You can definitely make a career path out of, like, your Instagram. Personally, like, it doesn't really matter to me. Everyday, people get distracted by the competitiveness and the game of Instagram. When you're like aspiring artists like all of us, you know, you're, like, rooting for the next. You're rooting for yourself and for others, like, "Oh, we're all going to make it." And then when I finally, like, kind of made it, everyone, like, closed me out. They, like, turned their backs on me. Not everybody's, like, posting photos, like, for the same reasons. Like, for me, it started out just like as a fun thing to do, and you know. But a lot of other people are also just trying to, like, stand out, or pop off or even, like, you know, make money off of it. I would say people became jealous that. I got all the notoriety and they only got a piece of it or they didn't get any. And they grew to hate me for that. The way he kind of, like, treated me and, like, all the friends that we used to, like, uh, hang out with and, uh, go out to explore with, he just sort of, like, burned all the bridges, you know. Honestly, I kind of understand exactly why Humza, like, did what he did, because he doesn't come from a wealthy home. You know, he's, like, definitely tried his best to, like, be in a better position, and, like, you know, make money. So, like, yeah, I respect that, but also he just like, uh, did it in a slightly, kind of, like, aggressive way. I mean, not to make it sound all sad, but just, like, all the people I considered my friends that I actually liked hanging around, they don't hang out with me because of the white flag incident or because they see me traveling, and have a large following, and think I'm Hollywood, so I'm usually just by myself. I feel like the bad thing about me is that, like, everything on Instagram is like the sale of my life. So like, really, there's like nothing... like, there's nothing bad. I don't know. It's, like, good because there's no, like, issues in my life but I feel like there's nothing that's, like, ever happened, which is kind of like, huh. Kaylyn and Max had actually been pretty low key, I think, as far as social media, about their relationship, their friendship and that. But there was one, uh, picture that went out, I think it was from a football game. All these people were commenting like, "Oh, my gosh, you have to see this, Kaylyn-". There was a link that somebody put down in the comments. A guy amongst the followers that was very much, shall we say, obsessed with Kaylyn. He was like, "I don't want her to have a boyfriend." And like, "I love her so much. I'm obsessed with her", and I was like, I've never met you in my life. He would say things like, "I want to come find you and then I want to" kill everybody just to find you and when I find you, "I want to kill myself." And so, my mom called the police and they came over. And so, he's like, "OK, well, I'll look at it. I'll see if we need to do anything", and he acted like it was nothing. If somebody is coming after me, it's, "Come on." But if it's your kid, that's a different thing, man. You don't mess with people's kids. Thank God this is a double-gated community, but the problem is the more exposure you get, the more susceptible you are to finding some nuts. He lives in Southern California and so do we. Like, he could get to me, like, whenever or wherever. Like, I don't want to feel unsafe at my own school. It's scary to just think that your followers can affect you like that. Your followers' not necessarily your friend. Like, how could you be so obsessed with me when you've never met me? You know, it's just weird, it's crazy to think about. Cheese. I don't really look through my direct messages. I mean, some of them are kind of inappropriate. Wait, no, I'm serious 'cause, like, sometimes, like, older dudes will just be like really weird and this is, "uh, OK, never mind." This guy found me and we started talking, but it got, like, really creepy because he wasn't following anyone else. I mean, I've gotten asked for nudes before, like, I'm pretty sure. Have you not? You can't send me nude pictures, like, oh my God, I'm only 15 so, you know, calm down. He started like commenting on my photos, like, "Hey, wanna talk? I'm still up." And I'm just kind of like, "Uh, leave me alone." I can't believe it's never happened to you. - No. - That's happened to me a couple of times. - Old men find our pages. - Yeah, that's right. They be like, "Hello, sexy." I'll be like... - Huh? Like, do you...? You look older than my father. - You could be my grandfather. I don't even know you and they'd be like, "What clothes are you wearing?" - Oh, geez. - Yes, and I'm just like... So you have to deal with the perverts, the disrespectful teenagers, the racist people and family members, that's too much. - Block 'em. - Too much. - Block the family. - It ain't done 'till they cut off. 432 is a tall building, really stood out on the skyline. Me and my friend, uh, 'night. Shift' one day, thought, like, this could be an insane view from the top of that building. We were just walking around midtown, we walked past a construction site and we kind of made a joke about it like, "Oh, we should do this." And then one day, we just said, you know, let's just go for it. We just hauled our way up there- Walked up, like, 95 flights of stairs. We got to the top floor. The only thing left was a crane, we started to climb up to the crane. Oh, my God. Dude. Fuck. Want to do it? It was really, like, amazing to see New York in that way. It was, like, covered in fog and we were just so high up. Oh, my God. We wanted to be out before anybody starts working again, so we started just, like, running downstairs. I posted, I think, in the next couple of days, the photos immediately got a lot of attention. And then, like, a week afterwards, my mom called me. She tells me to come home as soon as possible, and she's like, there's detectives here. I'm like, "Alright, I'll be home soon." Tonight, in Eyewitness News exclusive, a 17 year old charged now with climbing, quite illegally, a luxury apartment building under construction on the East side of Manhattan. 432 Park Avenue, the second tallest building in New York city, the teenager posting his pictures of his climb on the Internet and that's what got him arrested. The detectives drove me into a precinct by Columbus Circle... and after about three hours, they, uh, cuffed me and transported me to Central, uh, Bookings also known as the tombs. I was seeing him every day on the news, just Demid's photos, popping up on the internet. The next day, like, our mutual friend, called me and said, "Hey, did you" snitch on Demid?" I was like, "How would I know he was up there?" I was like, "We don't talk anymore." Supposedly, like, some, like, news reporter was outside his door and they all thought they got the information from me, and I was like, dude, I don't even know where you live. Detectives wound up finding. Demid's Instagram page and yesterday they knocked on his mom's door. Yeah, I know, it's like, the pictures were gorgeous. I know how teenagers look at it, I know a lot of people look at it. But at least, let's not look at it this way. I don't look at it this way either. It was worth it. I knew there were going to be consequences and, uh, I was willing to face the consequences. People reached out to me trying to act all concerned "they were like," Oh, so Demid got arrested. 'Night. Shift' got arrested. How come you haven't gotten arrested yet? It just doesn't make sense. Like, you're like the face of this scene right now "and everyone's getting arrested but you." An honest answer would be, I have no idea why I have not gotten arrested and I'm glad I didn't. I made my feed private for a while, because, uh, my lawyer said that it could affect my case. My friends weren't really on board for it. Like, they did not like Nick. He pulled the card on me, like, "Everyone thinks I have a bad reputation." I just want a good girl in my life." And I'm like, OK, I'll give you a chance. I said, chances are, if your friends are warning you, he's no good. We're almost too much alike. We both were, like, really outgoing people. So we kind of, like, fought. We fought a lot and we'd get in stupid fights. I kind of let my guard down. I fell for this guy and got super attached. This guy was just your classic, all I really want from you is sex. And girls, I feel bad for them, because they're in this, how do I demonstrate or let them know that I care about them? And that I want to be important to them? And so, she was a little... I think she was wanting more. I think she wanted a relationship. He's like, "Yeah, I'm hanging out with this" girl named Zoe tonight." And I was like, "why would you tell me that?" And he was like, "I just want to see where things go." And I was like, "What?" I just kind of asked him. I was like, "why aren't we...? Like, I thought you really liked me." He was just like, "You're just not physically attractive." He's like, "Your body is just not... ". After he said that, I just almost lost, like, control. I just literally, like, crumbled in a ball and like wanting to throw up. I think I didn't look at his Instagram. There was like posts with girls, that just piled on top of the situation. Looks matter, like, looks really do matter. Like, the older I get, I'm kind of realizing that they're not the only thing that matters, but for right now in high school, I feel like that's definitely the only thing that really matters, 'cause if you're good looking, you basically have it all. My sister came in my room when I was crying and she's like, "Hey, is everything alright?" I'm like, "yeah, I'm just super sad, man. Like, everything's cool." But I think deep down, like, it bothered her so much. And she was like, you know, "Why am I not good enough?" "Why am I not pretty enough?" I mean, it's every girl's struggle. After I saw those pictures and just everything caved in, I was like, "I'm done, man." Just 'cause I couldn't think of anything. I wanted to live for anymore. Nick, he got really worried and he sent me a bunch of texts, like, "Hey, are you OK?" Like, "Emma, please call me back." And I pick up my phone and I'm like, "Leave me alone. You've done enough." He just doesn't realize how, like, that messed me up, like, a lot. I was in my room and I threw my phone. And like, I was never, like, fully suicidal before. But I took scissors and you know, I cut my arms and I was like, this doesn't feel... I don't feel it anymore. And so then, I put a rope in my closet and I tried hanging myself, but, like, it just... I couldn't do it. So I saved up a lot of a antidepressant. I forget how many there was, maybe like 13, and, um, I took 'em. All of sudden, I hear this... You know, banging on the door. The kids are starting to scream and there's like, come on, there's lights going on. What's going on? And we're oblivious. I see lights hitting the windows and I'm like... Immediately I knew. And we go up and there she is laying on the floor in our bedroom and... Uh... She was, um, in the closet. At first glance, I see a noose is hung in the closet, about... And I look down and she's sitting in the closet. And she's not responsive. Her eyes are... Her pupils are as big as her eyes, they're completely black. And she's just looking straight ahead and her arms are down. And I just scooped her up and I said, "I love you." And I just kept saying, "I love you, don't you leave me." And I kept telling her to fight, that it was worth it, that high school would be over soon. I remember getting wheeled into the hospital. Then, I remember the doctor talking to me and I was still super out of it. I was super like, like I don't know, just exhausted almost. And, um... Then, after a while, I was alone for a little bit and I kind of was just like thinking to myself, like, what am I doing? Like, I felt terrible for what I did to my family. After, like, doing the 432, uh, thing, I had to deal with court for like, about a year. We finally came down to five days of community service. He was always like the reckless kid, you know? Like, when we were in tunnels, he'd be like, "Dude, I got us some headlights. "You want to put on the head torches?" And I'm just like, "No, people are going to see us." He's like, "Cool, well, got this tactical flashlight "so we don't trip over shit anymore." I'm just like, "Dude, stop." Funny kid, though. I kind of miss our adventures. I went back to my old neighborhood. Danny is one of my childhood friends that I grew up skating around. What's up? Oh, snap. He kind of, like, pointed me in the direction that I should go as far as living my life. It's so weird seeing all of these kids getting out like... - It's weird, 'cause it's still the same thing, -That's me. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. - Just like smoke. - It's like a cycle. - You can smell that too, right? - Yeah. - Oh, this is your block. - Yeah. I forgot. I've been crossing shit off my bucket list this whole year. Like, dude, like, off the record, I slept with a celebrity. Things like, shit like that, you know? Like, dude, I'm crossing this shit off, you know? Like, It's like, what? This is fucking awesome. Everybody is looking up to this guy. And nobody really can say that about any 18-year old that's come out of Astoria, Queens, you know? It's always like a reminder, it's like, this is where your life started. And then, like, you see people, like, hanging out and just, like, smoking weed. And It's like seven in the morning. I look at that, and I mean, it's not good to think that, but I'm like, "that's you." That's supposed to be you." One of my neighbors, like she was like, "Humza?" I was like, "Hey." Like you know, I say, "Hey, Ms. Ruthie." Like, "How are you?" She's like, "I'm so happy." She's like, "My daughter showed me what you be doing online." She's like, "I'm so glad a young black kid made it out of the ghetto." She was, like, crying for me. I was like, "wow." I didn't realize what I'm doing is having such an impact on other people's lives. And that's when I was like, there's a bigger picture out here than just who can get the best photo, who can get the biggest paycheck. I'm being a role model for these individuals whether I know it or not. In my head, I know who I want to be and who I am at the moment. It's like a fairy tale, you don't always get to be who you want to be. It's like an everyday struggle trying to be understood. I'm going to be honest, I don't read books. One book I do occasionally go back to is the 48 Laws of Power. One of the principles that I read about was, um... You know, whoever you idolize, tell them, "Man, I idolize you." Like, you are the king. You are the God." You know, like, make them feel like they don't need to do anything anymore. But why are you secretly still out in the street doing everything. You know, like, let them feel like they've eaten, they can sit back and rest while you're still out there working. And that's how you make your way to the top and you surpass them. And that's a rule that people constantly use on me even if they don't know it. So every time they're like, "Humza, you made it. Humza, you're the man." I'm just like, "Don't tell me that. I'm still out here hungry." Like, I'm still out here doing the same thing I'm doing." Kaylyn likes to win, let's put it that way. When Kaylyn was number two or something at a pageant, that was not good enough. I remember, she was like three years old, she's looking at the trophies. She always knew that the big, the big tall one was the person that was the winner. She used to say, "I want to be the winner." That's what she always said, "I want to be the winner." When I hit 500k, I got really excited, because it's like half a million. So, it's like, "Wow, OK. You're doing something right." - Hey. - Hi, How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Good... Now, my dad is, like, more into the fashion line and we had a meeting with Jasmine and it went really well. And we talked about everything, and so now, we're going to do it. I'll do the ground work for her, getting this thing together, but then like I said, they've got to put the effort in it and sell it. Hm. OK, let's figure out this pose, posing situation. It's going to be a small brand until it grows into something huge, kind of like her Instagram account. She's got 500,000 followers and climbing. She's already a brand. She's a brand that's emerging. She is an emerging market. Ooh, Kaylyn. Turning it on. - Wait, I was living for that, go back. - Now you made me laugh. Me and Jasmine are very hardworking and anything we do is successful. And so, anything that we're doing together is going to be even more successful, 'cause it's like, success and success, and, like, you put it together, it's like, more success. OK, serious now. Get in! Come on! I had to go to treatment for depression. I would stay there from, like, eight-thirty to three every day. And basically, just talking about my feelings. We had a phone box. We all had to put our phones in the box at the beginning of the day. People were so interactive. And, like, we just all, like, actually talk to each other. Like, everyone in the group talked. That was nice. You're supposed to, like, focus on yourself and really try to get better for yourself, but when I was there and I was kind of one of the people that were in better shape, like, mentally, than most people there. So I actually felt like I could do something positive there. So, like, I helped the girls that were bawling their eyes out. I could comfort them, 'cause I actually knew what they were going through. One girl had scars, like, all the way down her arm and her shoulders. I said, "What are those scars? Like, why did you do that to yourself?" She told me, she's like, "I feel so ugly." And she's like, "My boyfriend calls me fat. He'll be liking other skinny girls' pictures on Instagram." And I felt so bad for her, but then I couldn't be like, "Oh, it'll be alright, get over it." Because I do the same thing, you know? It's like, I can relate, so I'm in the same boat with you and I can't help you 'cause it sucks. It was really rough after I went home. I haven't been treated the same since I've been home, 'cause people are always checking up on me and stuff. Always like, taking my vitals like, "How are you doing" "on a scale of 1 to 10?" Just, I don't feel like they are treating me like they used to. I'm not, I'm not as well as she is, honestly. So... You know I'm... I struggle still. I think she's afraid that I'm going to tell her everything's fine when nothing really is OK. And to be completely honest, I'm kind of afraid I'll do that too. The only thing that I have seen that really helps teenage girls is when they help others. When they aren't focused on themselves, but they're focusing on others. And that's when I see... when I see things in them that you don't see on Instagram. I was just super... I wouldn't say positive, but very excited to be out of the treatment program. Just because I just wanted life back, which is crazy 'cause a month ago I didn't want life at all. ♪ Little do y'all know ♪ He taller, but that's My li'l Bro and that's a fact ♪ I'm going to fight a noble win Clothes, I'd come home ♪ For school like, You all wear my shoes now ♪ Humza outside, right ♪ Right by the stool With my shoes on ♪ I'm like, Yo, What are you doing, bro? ♪ Why are you always Wearing my clothes? ♪ Two years later, Probably three or four ♪ Humza Deas is making His own clothes ♪ Own socks Humzila, That's my little nigga ♪ That's a fact we getting Realla, 2016 bigger ♪ And I swap the hat, listen ♪ I'm so proud of my li'l bro ♪ wish old me was here right now To see my li'l bro ♪ That's a fact right now To see my little bro ♪ Yeah, Humza told me 'bout These other white jocks ♪ Saying how he was In Dubai taking flight jumps ♪ I'm like, damn Where the fuck I'm at? ♪ That's my bro, That's a fucking fact On social media, you can edit yourself into who you want to be. Meanwhile, in person, you're stuck with who you really are, but it's like a constant battle that everyone faces whether they admit it or not. So many people want to be like who they aren't. You know what I mean? So many people want to portray themselves as being perfect or having the perfect life. I don't, like, want to be, like, fake in that matter. I want people to think of me as a real person, and, like, be relatable and people to understand me. I think I gave the people behind the social media too much power. 'Cause, I mean, that's what Instagram's all about, you know, How many likes you get. And that literally controls the power of your picture. Now, I'm just like, if I want to post a picture "of a jellyfish, I'm going to." I did, that's why I said that. And so, I did. It's a nice picture. It is. It's a really good picture. That's awesome- Did you get a lot of likes? I don't know. It doesn't matter. Here we go. Yeah, wait. - You know. - You look good. Woah. Trying to get the... What does it look like... Wait, there, there. - Oh, that's good. - Ooh, the lighting. Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. I gotta take another one.
