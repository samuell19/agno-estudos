We interrupt your program to bring you this important message. Chaos at the India-Bangladesh border. Sardar, do you even realize the mistake you're about to make? How much did you get paid? How much did you get paid for committing treason? An unidentified person, abducted Indian National Security Advisor P.K. Abraham. Messing with me is like messing with my country. Your entire lineage will be destroyed. You're doomed! I am the National Security Advisor! Your Highness, is this true? Is it our Sardar? Yes! What you've done is treason to your country. As no terrorist organization claimed responsibility, Bangladesh Coast Guard has vigorously carried out a search mission at the border. You're a traitor! Don't forget that you can't step foot in India anymore! Put your weapons down. This is the Bangladeshi Coast Guard. - Do you know?! - I know! The first oath I took while getting recruited as a spy is not to make any record of the truth we find. All these years, I did not break my oath. But now I'm going to break it! I'm going to write down the truth about him. Once a wise person asked a question that was pricking my head. Who am I? The body? The Soul? Or name? What is our identity? Loving parents. Trusted friends. Sincere employee. We're in the race to find an identity for ourselves. But without an identity or a name of their own, a group operates that works in shadows. The Spies! Everyone is aware of Alexander, who conquered the world. But no one knows about the spies that helped him conquer. The vital tool that every country's Government invests its trust in is spies! A spy is a person who saves from an unknown danger. If the spy commits a treason... Or devise a danger that's unknown. We would not know the consequences right away. We'd lead a life as normal unaware of the approaching danger. We would never know when it hits us. Or when we would get destroyed. I cannot expose this truth. But one day, the truth will see the daylight. Someone will expose the truth to the world. TODAY CHENNAI For years we've been trying for a child. But the MMAK party came forward to help me. Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Express yourselves emotionally so that people will pity you. I'm expressing enough for mere ten votes that your party may garner. It's been ten months since we started this party. Neither the name of my party is famous. Nor the name was given to me by my grandma is famous. True that, Chief. Even our landlord is unaware of our party. He enquired, looking at the crowd. "Has there been a death in the family?" Chief, we need to get famous. I have an idea. Let's participate in Cook with Comali reality show. We would get good TRP. Chief, why should we seek help from another TV channel? Let's start our TV channel. - TV channel? - Yeah! Do you know how much it will cost? It's not a YouTube channel to create as you desire. How much does it cost to start a YouTube Channel? There's no cost involved. All we need is an email id. Then what are we waiting for? Let's create thousands of them. Chief, we can even start a million channels. But we need content. Content. Content, it is! Let's camp at Besant Nagar Beach and meditate for a good cause. Then we'd have to kill you! Chief, we can't go viral by meditating. Riots! Riots are our content. On our way here, a statue was covered at Tower Junction. - What statue? - It does not matter. We should stage a protest to unwrap the statue. The protest should explode into a riot. What after initiating a riot? Chief, "Trending" is like a see-saw. One who brings down the person on top... will rise in power! Top trending officer of Tamilnadu Police... Inspector Vijay Prakash. He's the reason #TamilnaduPolice has been a trending subject. This riot is to tarnish his name. As his name gets tarnished... we will earn a good name. We shall make him a villain. And turn you into a hero! During a peaceful protest The police department stirred up riots! Atrocity in public is publicity! What's the forecast? Expect heavy rainfall with lightning and thunder. Where? In front of the statue, near Tower Junction. A new party wants to initiate riots at a large scale under a minimal budget. I'll get it done! Make sure the rioters look dangerous. Don't bring along street vendors like you did last time. All they do is chew tobacco instead of sloganeering. It's not an ordinary task to instigate a Police officer. We have people to initiate riots. But we need someone to instigate them. Brother, this is Philips. He's good at instigating. - Hi! Hi! - This guy? - He's a skinny dude... - You, too, look like a pig! - Don't you stare! I'll kill you! - Hey! How was it? I'll do it. Give me the time and place, and I'll be there! The bloody guy instigated me in no time. - What's his name? - Vijay Prakash. Vijay Prakash! We have received the intelligence report. MMAK party is conducting a meeting with its 500 party members. When did their members' count go up? Hey, they have hired accomplices to fill in. Inspector Vijay Prakash is their target. They're going to instigate him and initiate riots. If they succeed, it'll bring a bad name to the department. Negotiate with mere words and don't lay hands on them. Precisely, Vijay Prakash should not arrive at the site. Okay, sir. Hey! You did not just wrap the statue. You have hurt our self-esteem and courage. You've hurt our Tamizh sentiments. Hey, do you even know what statue it is? How would we know when it's wrapped? Only if you unwrap, we'd know. Look, I may be a calm police officer. Why are you even here? Ask the Inspector to come. "Ask the Inspector to come." Inspector won't come. I'm in power here. Ah! As if you're a power bank. Come closer, I'll charge my phone. Sloganeer! Sir, Inspector Vijay Prakash is arriving. Oh, God, no! UNWRAP THE STATUE! Sir, despite telling him not to, he has arrived. Wait! Why is it that you don't pay heed to your uncle? Your presence will put the situation out of control. The entire press is here. Please don't come, Viji. Uncle, is the entire press here? Right from national channels to local YouTube channels are present. Don't ruin your name. It's dangerous! It's not a danger, uncle. But an opportunity. We should make the most of it. Unwrap! Unwrap! Unwrap the statue! Unwrap! Unwrap! Unwrap the statue... ...unwrap the statue! "Police is your friend." To protest is your right! As far as you protest in peace without being a nuisance... the police department will provide protection. Please continue! - Viji, what's wrong with you? - Hey, Police! Do we look like the ones who'd protest in peace? Look, we broke bottles and shattered glass on the road. I did not witness it. I can't take action on something I did not witness it. I'd consider it if something happens furthermore. Why are you instigating the protestors? POLICE ATROCITY DOWN! DOWN! Viji, why did you instigate the protestors? Jaanu, nowadays you don't write anything about me? Instead of controlling the riot, he's flirting. - Sir, ask him to do something. - Viji... - ...they are damaging buses. - This is a set up too. Viji, what's wrong with you? No matter how much you riot until the affected citizens file an official complaint, we can't take any action. Our hands are tied! But if you instigate the self-esteem of the Police department, I warn you things will go out of control. They will go out of control! - Burn down the effigy. - There they go! Police Atrocities! Down! Down! Police Atrocities! Viji, they're out of control. They're instigating the police by burning an Effigy. They're burning down a watchman effigy. You don't get worked up. - Wait! - One whack and they'll disperse! Come on, come on! Run them down. Come on! Even the Tsunami can't drown us. And here he has brought a water tanker to disperse us. Hey! We are raging fire! I'd even immolate for the sake of my Chief. Water is no threat to me. Come on, cannon it. Come on! Hey! Hey! It's petrol! What the hell? Hey, Police! You can't burn our chief just like that. Who said so? I'll file a case stating he burned himself while lighting the effigy. - What do you say? - Sure, let's do it! I heard someone calling himself a blazing fire. That's him right there. - The officer is calling you. - Hey, run for your life. The guy who said he would immolate for his chief. - Look, he's right over there. - Hey, run, damn it! What about the guy who challenged Tsunami? Cheif! Don't run. You don't realize the importance of petrol. Vendavaram, the see-saw is an old trick. You don't have enough experience.

India This is the final hearing of this case. India's complaint: China has built illegal dams on Brahmaputra river that belongs to India. Let's hear the argument from China. Respected Judges of the court. To be straight and honest. India is a leaking tap. Evidence for your evaluation. Indians worship the rainwater. Neither do they know how to conserve it. Nor protect their reserve. Instead of using the Brahmaputra river efficiently, they've let it overflow into the Bangladesh river. But we have built dams to use it efficiently Indians feel jealous. It's pure jealousy! Your lordships! That's a poor attempt to insult us. Jealousy? It's not jealousy to fight to attain the treasure that belongs to us. It's our right! It's an old story that Indians did not know how to conserve or preserve water. That ended with the previous generation. India is a self-sufficient and self-made country. As they said, we were poor at managing our water resources. But now it's different. We have a new plan for water management. With all the nations gathered under one roof, I'm proud to present my company Oasis's new plan on behalf of India. ONE INDIA, ONE PIPELINE Water resources in India are scattered all over the country. We are going to bring them all together and evenly distribute them. Whether it's a desert or forest. Or it's a parched land. I will ensure every tap in India will have a water supply. Single Unified Piping Network. Phase 1 of this project has begun in South India at Dasaram mountains. The construction is complete. The distribution will begin from November 15th. This network will spread to many parts of India in the next three years. We will be leaders in water management throughout the world. We are going to teach the world water management. Including China! Sir, I request the court to put a stay on the illegal dams that is being constructed by China. This court advises The People's Republic of China to sign a new treaty with India. We just showed China its place. We have won the case! My company Oasis and I feel proud to have represented India. We have presented a scheme that will make every Indian proud. Morse Code! Cockroach! Where were you all these days? I was underground, Chetta! Only now is the time right for me to come out. Rathore won the case. All this while he was conning Indians. But now he has conned the entire world. To the world, One India, One Pipeline is a water distribution network. But in reality, it's the water control network. Absolute total control! If we slowly light up the frog stuck in the drinking water, It would be confusing about whether it's getting boiled or dying. Suddenly one day, it'll explode to death. Similar would be the state of our people. They are unaware that One India One Pipeline is dangerous. People believe Rathore is their savior. The entire system dance to Rathore's tunes. People say water is blue gold! But now it's not gold. Instead, it's scattered across the nation as rivers and ponds. We will bring them all under the pipeline network. Afterward, we will decide who gets how much water. You must be wondering how to turn water into gold. Water Meter! In every household, just like an EB meter. The price it displays will turn water into gold. All the doors have closed on us. - Going to the court... - There's no use in going to the court. Everything is already fixed! To put an end to it, he should return. Sardar should return! - Did you meet him? - I'm still looking for him. I believe he's alive. Even if Sardar is alive. He won't come out until it's Code-Red! I'm sure you're aware where is Code-Red. We can't retrieve it! I'm sure it can't be retrieved. We have to steal it! Neither you nor I can steal it. We need a person to do it. I'll look for Sardar. You look for a thief. Viji! Viji, over here! Your girlfriend, Shalini has filed a case against me. What case? I subtly pulled over a vehicle by tapping the cane. But she has filed a case stating I used force and demanded a bribe. How could five hundred rupees constitute a bribe? She has filed a theft case against me. She has filed a robbery case against me too. I wonder how you would manage a wife that's a lawyer. Hey, it's not enough that you call her my girlfriend. She's calm with you. Viji, I'll be suspended for six months. A human can't reason with your girlfriend. But you, please speak to her and resolve it. Fine, I'll think about it. Forget it! What happened? It's written all over your face that you're smitten. Brother, how could you? We are from the same community. I will not give up on you. Summon right? I'll handle her. Welcome, kids. Need a selfie? - Your brother? - I'm not seen in the picture. You will be in the picture. - Okay! Tag me. - Okay, thank you. Fans! What's up? You're here to defend Manickam. Get up and scram! Manickam? What happened to him? - Don't you know? - No, dear! I'm here to welcome you to our family event. Would you like to have almond milk? - You're here to welcome? - Yeah! Isn't this the summon I sent? Oh, yeah! It has your name on it. - You never mentioned it. - Yeah, right! Unlike you, I don't publicize the work I do. Hey, Shalini, that's not fair! I don't like publicity. Okay! You're such a fibster! Fibster? Shalu, they're innocent. Please withdraw your case. Viji, you have known me since childhood. I don't like people who support people that do immoral things. All these years of friendship, yet you don't get me. You're piling on without paying heed to me. What are you about to say? What you don't say. I know it all. Hey, what do you know about me? Did you come to lie? Or you're here to propose... your face gives you away with subtitles. - Hi! - Hi! - Sister, you want water? - Get lost! Okay. Hey, Shalini! Hey, when did I propose? The first time! You forgot I was just a kid at Bala uncle's wedding and came to propose with a rose. And you used to listen to All India Radio to learn Hindi. - Shalini! - Hey, listen! - What do you want? - Nothing! Let's go! Second time: Mute lover! - Shalini! - Yes mom! You sent balloons to my mother, thinking it was for me. Hey, who is out there? Third time: You were going for a Police interview and me to the Bar exam. 29-C bus, was empty. You came close enough with the love letter and left without giving it to me. Here! The same look is on your face. Look, the first two times... I agree to an extent. The third time is unacceptable. I was stressed due to the exam, so I never even saw you. - I believe you! - Shalini! I've been looking for you everywhere. - I'm coming. - Hi, auntie. - Viji, come over here. - It's okay. A picture with you will make us trend too. Come on! Thank you! Viji, I need to talk to you. Gentlemen, I hope you know him. Meet Inspector Vijay Prakash. It's because of him for the past three months, eighteen times #TNPolice has been trending - I'm proud of you. - Thank you, ma'am. I'm thinking of making him the mascot for our outreach program. I think he should be the face of the Tamilnadu Police. If he's the face of the Tamilnadu police, who are we? We have achieved a lot for the department. And we're proud of it. Without knowing his true history, please don't call him the face of the department. I'm hurt. He keeps saying that it's his family event. Ask him if it's genuinely his family's event. His father is a traitor and murderer! I feel it's wrong to have recruited him as a police officer. But you want to make him the face of our department. - What a bloody shame! - Sir, let it go. Viji, you, please leave. Please tend to guests. Go! Why don't you ask him about his family? What's happening out here? What you've done is treason to your country. His father is a traitor! Your son is a traitor! How much did you get paid? Why don't you ask him about his family? Here, have some coffee. Drink! He's a useless officer. Don't take it to your heart. He does not deserve the stars on his shoulder. Had I even taken 25% of the bribe, all the sky stars would have been on my shoulders. He can't speak at will because he's your girlfriend's father. It's not just him who speaks. Everyone has the same opinion. I don't even remember my father's face. But I'm paying for his sins. He abandoned us. My entire family died. - They should've left me for dead... - Hey! Am I not here for you? Bhavani is there for you. No matter how many times you wake up startled... I will bring you a hot cup of coffee. How is this relevant? Ask around about me in the department. Do I even have one black mark? Who made Tamilnadu Police trending on Twitter? They will never consider it. When I joined the department, there was just one file that said my father is a traitor. I did many good things and stacked-up files. They bring back the file on top and forget the good I did. I don't have an identity of my own. Viji, if you are looking for an identity, you won't find it. It will come looking for you. It's all because of you. You could have raised me as your own. Why did you raise me as your nephew? You'd believe it if I said I'm your father. But the people won't believe it. Drink coffee and sleep. Let alone being your father they don't believe I'm your uncle. Item Number - 73 Read petition number - 11/20 Petitioner: Sameera Thomas It's the Government's duty... to provide a quality water supply for free. It should not be handed over to a private company. For the service of the people... we kindly request an order to stay, One India One Pipeline project. My Lords! This project is being carried out in the Public interest. Government can't carry out projects on its own. We would need the help of private companies. There's nothing unconstitutional about the One India One Pipeline project. Therefore the petition file is dismissed. Next! Who are you? And what do you want? You have only one option left to stop this project. Go to the railway station and meet this person. Be on time. But miss the train. What time is your doctor's appointment? Dad, if we go early, we can return sooner. - Okay! I don't want it. - Sister, here you go. - Have some egg dosa. - I don't want it. Viji, make one crispy dosa for me too. You had enough! Off late, it's hard to spot a difference in who's pregnant in this house. You are Armed Reserve (AR), and I'm LMO. I have to be on rounds all the time. Rough mealtime tends to put on a tummy. It's not like the Army gets its food delivered to the doorstep. Don't they look fit? They were given a chance they would prefer their food delivered too. Erm... yes! Where? Okay, fine. - Viji! - Yes! People have staged a protest at Rajaji Bhavan without permission. We have to disperse the protestors. - Make one dosa for me. - You're done. Wash your hands. Did you read the intelligence report? I did read the report, sir. I'm on alert. - Don't worry! - Sir! Malligai ma'am, did you eat? No, sir. The protestors have made my life hell. DON'T PRIVATIZE THE WATER SUPPLY DON'T PRIVATIZE THE WATER SUPPLY - Whatsapp group? - Yes, sir. It's spreading like fire on social media. - Bring in the Jammer! - Okay, sir. Bring the Jammer vehicle to the site. - Has the press arrived? - Yeah, they are right here. - Does my hair look good? - Eh... yes, sir, it's good. END THIS INJUSTICE Hey, I've lost the signal on my phone. Malini, five more are about to join the protest. Beyond that, I'm not able to inform anyone. Internet, network, everything is down! - Who's leading the protest? - The lady in the blue salwar. Her name is Sameera. Madam, please come here. You seem well-informed. Don't you know you need permission to stage a protest? We did request but were denied! It's a democratic country. It would be best if you had patience. Democracy is not just for us. It applies to Oasis company too. We want to stop the pipeline project. Staging a protest is our right. Agreed, madam! But we must dissolve the protest. Sir, how could you support the private company? Committing a crime is one thing. But supporting crime is the biggest mistake. The mere words may be yours. But your ideals seem to reek of someone else. I thought as much! - Sami, is he demanding a bribe? - What? - Let's not create any issues. - Don't worry, he's from my neighborhood. Neighborhood? Madam, you couldn't get a better lawyer? Please disperse. If not, I'd have to use force. You cannot use force! In pari delicto. Both parties have wronged. You can only arrest us. But can't dissolve the protest. - Do you have an arrest order? - No! Then let us continue the protest until you get the order. Once you have it, you can arrest us. Fine, continue your protest. But move to the side. Everyone get to the corner. Come on, move! Ladies, please move. It looks like today I'm going to get entertained. Sir, they don't seem to listen. No idea what to do? My girl is getting fried under the sun. Don't block the road and move to the side. I said, move to the side! Please hear me out. Move to the side. DON'T TURN IT INTO A BUSINESS Come on, move! - Move to the side. - DON'T TURN INTO... - ...INTO A BUSINESS! - Ma'am, please step aside. Keep moving. Why don't you listen? - Keep moving! - Okay? I said, go. Go! It's scorching hot. Wear your Stohl. Imbecile! Imbecile? - Hey, switch off the Jammer. - Okay, sir. Switch of the Jammer. Over! Ma'am, please step aside. Bloody woman! Switch on the Jammers. She's annoying me! Are there online classes to learn English? - We have Google for that! - Sir! We have received the arrest order. - So soon? - Yes, sir. Arrest everyone and hold them in the auditorium. Come on, board the bus. Hurry up! What is this? Did the Police hurt you? - No, they did not. - Hurry up, we're running late. Board the bus. You too! Shalu, shall I drop you in my vehicle? I, too, came down to protest. I'll board the bus. As you wish, madam! Don't you have your vehicle? Why are you on the bus? I have a vehicle, but old memories stirred up on looking at it. Incorrigible! Shalu... Take it, in case the three times had I gathered the courage and proposed to you. What would've been your reply? Why do you ask me? Rewind your memory, revisit those instances, and ask for the Shalini from that timeline. Okay? Greetings to everyone, this is Shehnaaz. Come on, let's drown ourselves in love during this telecast. I don't care about it. But should you worry... ♪ My love, My dear love ♪ ♪ My love, My dear love ♪ ♪ My love, My love, Don't move away from me ♪ ♪ My love, My heart, Don't make me beg ♪ ♪ My love, My love, Don't prick my heart ♪ ♪ My love, My heart, Don't leave me ♪ ♪ Even if I see you ♪ ♪ The garden will blossom What did you do, my dear? ♪ ♪ Even if you are far off, ♪ ♪ your fragrance finds me You intoxicate me ♪ ♪ What is there between you and me ♪ ♪ Even when you come in my dream I stagger to speak ♪ Sir, she wants to leave as her son is not keeping well. ♪ My love, My love, Don't move away from me ♪ ♪ Don't make me go around in circles ♪ ♪ My love, My love, Don't kill me ♪ ♪ Don't make me suffer With your subtle moves ♪ ♪ Even if I see you ♪ ♪ The garden will blossom What did you do, my dear? ♪ ♪ Even if you are far off, ♪ ♪ your fragrance finds me You intoxicate me ♪ ♪ What is there between you and me ♪ ♪ Even when you come in my dream I stagger to speak ♪ - I gave it to her. - It's just a FIR! Get going! Shalu... - Shall we revisit our old memories? - What? As you mentioned earlier. The same 29-C bus. We are alone on the bus. Are you sure we're alone on the bus? - Listen, get down from the bus. - Sir! - Don't forget to send the pictures. - Okay, sir. Tell me the truth. I know that you like me. Yes. I used to like you. As the old Viji! I am still the same. Nothing has changed. The old Viji did what he desired. He lived life on his terms. But now you live on different terms to please the people. I don't expect you to understand. I know you'd state your father as an excuse. How long are you going to harp on this excuse? You're living under the fear of your father's image. You're lost! You want your pictures to come on TV and banners. You're living life to gain praise from people... You've turned fake, Viji. Forget about it. Do you like me or not? It's not that simple. When you are fake and shallow... For someone who lived a life without scars wouldn't understand my pain. What did they ask you when you went to write your exams? Whether you have a hall ticket? Do you know what did they ask to me? They asked me to get a certificate stating I had nothing to do with my father. And, Bhavani sister... Eight suitors rejected her. It's all because of my father. Whenever I see my photo or news on TV, I believe I'm atoning for the sins of my father. Whenever I came down to propose to you, I used to fear you'd see me the same way people do. For the first time today, I overcame my fear. I believe you understood me. But you did not. I have lost a lot because of my father. I'll consider that I lost the love of my life. Driver, stop the bus! Viji! Viji! Come over here. What is it? Were you sent to dissolve the protest that took place at Rajaji Bhavan? Yes! Do you have the details of all the protestors? - I have an FIR with me. - Bring me the FIR. I'll get it. Anything serious? I was told an important file had gone missing. - At Rajaji Bhavan? - Yes. - What about CCTV cameras? - Hopeless! As we used Jammer to stop the protest... the security cameras were down. During the downtime, someone broke in and stole the file. What was so important at Rajaji Bhavan? Rajaji Bhavan was built during the reign of the Britishers. There's a secret tunnel that runs under its structure. The RAW record room is inside the tunnel. RAW record room? Yes. It contains old army secrets. They're calling CODE-RED and Red Letter. Whoever stole it must be a traitor to its country. It's a critical file. Right from CBI to RAW is going haywire, trying to crack it. I better leave. Give it to me. If not, they'll pounce on me. Bye, Viji! - Hello! - Advocate, ma'am! In the name of investigation, the Police are cracking on us. - Hurry up! - Thangamma, calm down. What happened? As we staged a protest earlier... In the name of investigation, the Police are cracking on us. Don't speak a word to the police. I'll call you back in ten minutes. Okay! - Hello? - What's happening, Viji? The police are raining on atrocities on the protestors. What kind of is extrajudicial nonsense this? Committing a crime is one thing. But supporting the crime is the biggest mistake. Don't be ranting without knowing the intensity of the situation. The police know their duty well in who and who not to investigate. - Myil! - Why did you ask me to stay? - Where is Abdul? - He's praying inside. Bloody sleeping like a pig! Show me the pictures from the protest. - Sure! - Viji, for the past week, we've been desperate to look for new content to publish. Give us some inside news. That would help us publish sensational news. - Good? - Why are you annoying me? They're good pictures... Show me the pictures of the protest. Next! Next! - Is that all? - That's about it. Perhaps there are out-of-focus pictures in recycle bin. Open the recycle bin. Next! Next! How did you get hurt? Sir, she wants to leave as her son is not keeping well. Sir said you may leave. After sending it to me, delete these four pictures. Sure, as you say. You arrived all riled up. Tell me, what is it? I'll publish the news. You asked me for content. I'll return in the morning with headlines. Headlines?! - Kathir, it's an important case. - Tell me, Viji. I have to report to ABP. A woman is a missing look everywhere. Inform all the control rooms. Name: Sameera Age: 30-35 Hey, move your bike. She was wearing a blue salwar and Grey Stohl. - Listen, CBI may contact you. - CBI? I believe it's a high-profile case. Yes. I got a lead. So, don't be a fool and blurt it out. Come straight to me when you trace down the location. - Later you can tell the others. - Sure. - What is it, uncle? - Why aren't you home? - I got hold of something great. - What is it? All these years, I was labeled as the son of a traitor. Tomorrow I'll be celebrated for arresting a traitor. You eat and sleep. I'll call you when I'm done. Sir, Timothy... - Timothy? - 29/6, sir. Thank you, sir. Hey! Hey, open the door! Open the door. Hey, open the door! - Hello... is this 100? - Hey! - Hey! - A thief has broken into our house. Please send over the police. - He looks well-built. - Hey! Hey! - Send in twenty police officers. - Hey, give me the phone. This is Inspector Vijay Prakash. You never dialed? I thought you'd be scared to hear the name of the police. Not bad. You are quite a courageous thief. Hey, I'm a Police officer. How do I believe? You're not wearing a uniform. Come over here. Look, that's my Jeep. Oh, you stole the Police jeep too. Trust me. Where's your mother? Have you come to arrest my mother? Why do you ask? Police arrive home often to arrest my mother. So I asked. No, I just want to talk. If that's the case, what's wrong with you? Go! My mother is not here. - Did you sketch everything? - Yes. - Is this your mother's laptop? - Yes. - Give me the password. - I can't give you the password. $@RDR When was the last time your mother spoke to you? Maybe two hours ago. She said, "I will send you cake. Please eat it." Also, she said she would return home only in the morning. Any idea from where she made the call? She must've called from the cake shop. Not that she could've called from a barbershop. Is that a smartwatch? So that my mother can keep track of me. Is it possible to track your mother with this watch? I thought you were not going to steal. I did ask your permission. I'll give it back once your mother returns. Stay safe! You broke the lock and the door. How do you expect me to stay safe? - Greetings, sir. - Greetings! Why did you put barricades? A document has gone missing. They asked to check every woman in the age group of 35-45. Move aside the barricades. - Sure, sir. - Clear the barricades. Are they looking for my mother? No, they are not. Greetings, sir. Did this woman come here? No, sir. I don't recognize her. - Sir, I recognize her. - When? - Maybe two hours ago. - Where? She was sitting right here. She stood up suddenly, came over, and asked to pack a hamper. Could you pack me this hamper? - Takeaway or delivery? - Delivery! Later, she gave me the address and left the cash on the counter. On seeing someone, she went outback through the backdoor. - Open it. - Sir, the key is on the counter. Bring it. Hey, hold it right there! Did anyone else enquire about her? No one enquired us. But four men stepped out of a Government vehicle... and enquired the customers at the cafe. What kind of vehicle? Not sure which kind. But in front of the vehicle was a symbol of crossed swords. Intelligence Department. I am Ganesh. My number is 8055058065. - I'll call you. - Okay, sir. - Hello! - I got her location. - She's at an ice cream shop on ECR... - Idiot, I'm already there. - She absconded! - Absconded? The entire area is barricaded, and a perimeter has been set. There's no chance she would've escaped. Dear... Do you know someone in this area who knows your mother? I don't know. Would you like chocolate? How many do you expect me to eat? I have tooth decay. How about ice cream? Kuppusamy Number - 5 First Main Road Indira Nagar. - Who are you? - Do you know Sameera? - Who are you? - Inspector Vijay Prakash. Sameera has been charged with IPC 124-A for treason. If you're aiding her, you will be charged with the same. Sedation case? - Sir, you have a wrong impression. - I'll be the judge of it. - What do you know about her? - I'm Timmy's doctor. I have known him since he was born. I'm finding it hard to inform you. But we go to accept the truth, Sameera. Timmy has Sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease. His lungs have been affected. He has maximum four-to-five years. That's it! Doctor, what caused it? If I had been just another doctor, environmental causes are hard to diagnose, and I would've blamed fate as an excuse. I am saying this as a family friend... bottled mineral water causes it. When the water bottle is old or exposed to the sun, the chemical BPA in the bottle gets mixed with the water. Timmy consuming water mixed with BPA has caused it. - Mom... - Hmm! Can we only ask for gifts for ourselves from Santa? Who else do you have in mind? No one else should fall sick like me. Also, good mothers like you should never cry. How do we get this message to Santa? Put in a request by writing a letter to him. Santa will definitely make your wish come true. Doctor, is there no cure for it? Can't we shut down these companies citing my son as an example? Sameera, it can't be proved! BPA is untraceable once it's in our system. It's only traceable when it's inside the bottle. Daily, 650 tankers and 700 trucks ply the Chennai metro. Daily, 230 litres of water are distributed across the city. And you're here threatening by holding a small bottle. If you can, then bring water from a pond or river. I will run a test. I concur you won't test bottled water. Do any rules bind you? Rules do not bind me. This is how we work. Can you state the same on camera? Madam, why would you take out the camera? Had you mentioned it earlier... I would've groomed myself. I can't state anything. Get lost! She is causing me stress in the name of BPA. Bloody woman! Do you realize you're responsible for a public health disaster? Crush the bottle after use. Keep away from direct sunlight. We have printed clear warnings on every bottle. How are we responsible? You don't defer from printing your brand name in every language. In bold letters! But your warning label is tiny and oblivious to an ordinary person. The warning label is printed not to save the people. But to save yourselves! I won't let this slide. She staged protests against bottled water companies. She became a water warrior! How could you accuse her of treason? Every year approximately Two thousand children are affected. When an affected child comes to me for treatment... despite the fact, it's caused due to BPA I sign it off saying environmental and genetic cause. I should be charged with treason. She's protesting for all the children. She's a noble person. Did you eat? Do you need to take any medicine? Did the doctor blurt it out? I'm not sad about it. Why would you feel sad? Start the vehicle. Let's go and meet my mother. Inspector Vijay Prakash. Inspector Vijay Prakash. This is Inspector speaking. We have the result on your APB. Blue salwar. Grey Stohl. 35-year-old woman. Where are you holding her? Sir, we didn't find her alive. We only found her body. Son, is this your mother? Nodding won't help. Say yes or no. Mom... The boy has been identified. Come on, lift her. Son, step aside. Sameera stole important documents from Rajaji Bhavan. After the authorities cornered her with no choice left, she committed suicide. We believe she was paid a huge sum of money. Do you know the details of the document? That's classified information. Even we are not aware of its details. But she committed treason. She stole military secrets. Despite her passing, she will be considered a traitor. We are going to investigate her blood relatives and acquaintances. They, too, shall be charged with treason if found guilty. - Hey, don't photograph the child. - Sir, just one picture. Don't do it! Sir, the son of the deceased is here. - You can't photograph a minor. - I'm from YouTube. I can! We discussed what my mother would do when I'm not around. But we never discussed what I would do when my mother is not around. What should I do? Do you have someone? I have grandpa Victor. Mom was going to take me to him on Christmas. Also, we were going to mail a letter to Santa Claus. I have the letter with me. But mother is not here. Could you help me post the letter? Sir, we have orders to screen Sameera's son. Where are you taking him? Sorry, sir, I can't divulge. It's the protocol. Sir, where is it happening? This boy is innocent. Timmy, please answer their questions with truth. Don't be scared. Wear your watch. They will take you to grandpa Victor. Vijay, take a look. You were the first one to file an FIR in this case. You were the first one to put an APB. As it's your case, I brought the case file. Headlines for tomorrow: "Inspector Vijay Prakash captured the traitor." You will be the breaking news on National TV. Why do you look sad? - It's a national case. - Get lost! Hey! Vijay, what happened? Something is wrong, uncle. They're lying about her being a traitor. They booked a case only on the previous night. But she was found dead at the shore in the morning. They're in a hurry to shut the case, citing it's a suicide. I sense a conspiracy. Whenever I look at the kid, I'm reminded of my dreams. He's in my place, and I'm in your place. - We should not give up. - Vijay? Uncle, my father was a criminal. It's my ill fate; I'm enduring it. But his mother was a good soul. Like me, that boy should not endure. - I understand. Tread carefully... - I'm not giving up. Hey, Vijay! The doctor has confirmed it's a suicide. She was killed! What makes you sure? Four litres of water entered her lungs. Turn to the third page. It's drinking water. How did she wash up at sea shore if it's drinking water? On the 5th page, it says the water contained 75% chlorine. They must've drowned her in a chlorination tank. What do we do now? Where do we find a chlorination tank that could drown a person? Erm... swimming pool... water company... - What else? - Metro water? Sir, please take a look at this picture. Sir, it's not like she got killed by a water tanker. - Why are you here? - Sir, please cooperate. I cannot cooperate. - Perhaps I can feel pity on her. - Pity? I felt pity. Is that enough? Get lost! Viji he's going overboard. Hello! Have you ever filed a complaint at the police station? We would do the same. Let's go! This calls for a different technique. Old lady, give me half a foot of garland. What would you do with half a foot? At least get two feet! Then my sister has to buy a wig to wear the flowers. Your sister does not have long hair? Look at her and tell me. Is she your sister? Do you know my sister? Yeah, I know her well. Dear, I see you scream your lungs out. Bottled water seemed to be good. The water is good. But this bottle is poisonous. Poison? We buy bottled water as it's pure. Because of the bottle, we're in the situation to pay for water. First, we were asked to pay for drinking water. But now we are paying for water to wash and cook. You're right, dear! I pay ten rupees a pot every day. Without our knowledge, we got used to it. They'll drain the groundwater and make money from it if this continues. We will be left with no water to even splash on the flowers. - I'm saying there will be no flowers! - Ah?! Your sister tried her best. Right from truck contractor Logu to water company owners, they are bloodhounds! - Please take care of your sister. - I'll take my leave. Sure! God bless! Viji, look, they're siphoning water from the same well. They are filling up the domestic tanker for five rupees per pot. And ten rupees per pot for cooking water. They fool the public with the color of the tank. Two thousand? Hey, hike the price. Hike it to 2800 rupees. That's an arid area. We have the upper hand. - Logu! - Huh? Do you recognize her? Are you the investigating officer? Just answer the question. As you're not, don't bother me. Shall I call the AC? Or shall I call the DC? Uncle, he's acquainted with AC and DC. - Apologize to him. - Sure, I will. Sorry, sir. Respectfully, sorry, sir. Sincerely, sorry, sir. Obediently, sorry, sir. Thanking you. You, too, apologize. I know I'm not the investigating officer. - Shall I apologize too? - No, sir. Please don't! What did you do to her? Sir, I did not do anything. Sameera didn't spare anyone. She troubled all the bottled water companies. Also, she's the reason nine companies were sealed. But that was not the problem. In the end, she woke the beast of them all. She released a video. After watching the video, I was dead scared. She exposed them all and did not spare anyone. Suddenly the video was pulled down and the girl died! I'm sure the water company owner must've done it. Yes, I'm at the airport. I'm in uniform. I'll be on high alert! Okay, sir. He's a hopeless officer. He believes whatever I say. This company is sealed too. I wonder how did TMS get past it? I don't know. Hey, you climbed so fast! Hey, Viji! Uncle, there are CCTV cameras. But it's switched off. - I'm sure, inside... - Climb up! Don't give up! I'm going to make it! Hey, I wonder how you got selected as Police. It was me who got you into the police. Be first to give a counter. Help me! - Use a stone and climb up. - Stone? Good lord, I got a milestone. At this hour, I usually park the department vehicle in a corner... and threaten the night riders and tea vendors. Also, I take a short nap. But this guy brought me here. Phew! Now watch me fly through it. I'm used to being flexible. I'm going to slide through it. Here I come. - I got you hooked! - Brother, not even one Joker! Hey, why is the light flickering? Check who's out there. Hey, who's out there? Hello, I asked. Who are you? What are you doing over here? Don't flashlight it on my face. Point it over there. You don't have a problem playing cards. But scared of checking. Hello, brother, who are you? Can't you hear me speak? - Hello? - How many tankers are out here? How does it matter to you? Stop! Who are you? And what are you looking for? I can only say if I find it. Step aside! Brother, how dare he disrespects you? - Uncle? - You broke in like a hulk. You didn't care for me. - My tummy is stuck. - You're becoming a nuisance. Watchman, my uncle's paunch is stuck. - Open the side gate. - Watchman? - Send someone. - Brother, how dare? Hey, who did you peg us for? It was me who killed Manali Gaja. - I'm at the bottle factory. - He does not seem to fear. - It's okay. I'll handle it. - Hey! You don't know who you're messing with. I killed Manali Gaja. Uncle, do you remember Manali Gaja? Twin Tail Sekar killed him, right? - Yeah! Why do you ask? - He confirmed it. Hey, it's the Police! They're all stooges. They can't even lie. I was teaching them a lesson. I'm stuck and in pain. But you're teaching them a lesson. Hey, I'm serious. They've been running a sealed factory. I'm sure they're powerful. We need to tread carefully. There he goes! Viji, send me the watchman and then fight. Uncle, everyone out here is busy. Sir, sir, sir. My ear, sir. It's hurting. - Ear, ear, ear! - A rowdy can lie. But should not lie they're rowdy. Come! - My ear! - I'm resting in peace. Sir, sir, sir! Sir, sir, please, sir. Sir, sir! Oh, God, no! Sir, sir... sir! Sir, sir, sir. My ear. Oh, no! Hey, come and save me. No way, I'm not coming. Hey, help me! - Sir, it's hurting. - What is it? Are you looking for this? Sir, you don't need to use force. I'm friends of police. Moreover, I'm your fan, sir. - Bloody liar. - Oh? You followed me a couple of minutes ago. - I got a notification! - Sir, tell me what you're looking for. I'll coordinate with everyone and find it for you. - I came looking for truth. - Sir? Oh, no, sir. No need for philosophy. We are not worth it. Just tell me what you are looking for. - I will give it up. I will. - Yes, sir. Where is the chlorine tank? - What did you do to that girl? - Sir, I'll confess! Sir, I got a call. They asked me to open the gate. The vehicle that arrived seemed like a Government vehicle. Four men brought a girl captive and entered the factory. Later, a man arrived. I have never seen him before. It was that man who tortured the girl in the chlorine tank. Water Warrior! Not able to breathe underwater, right? What did they ask her? They enquired about a file. How do you know about the secret entrance? Who told you about the file? What else did they enquire? Singh! They enquired about a Singh. Brother, it was not Singh. Sardar! What do you know about Sardar? I have never met Sardar. But I know that you people fear the mention of his name. Only after hearing Sardar's name, they killed her. She released a video. She exposed them all and didn't spare anyone. - Give me the password. - $@RDR I need Sameera's laptop. I'm taking a risk. You better return it. Let's go! If you have bought a water can for 35 rupees... or you buy bottled water for 20 rupees when you step outside? This video is for you people. As my son fell ill due to drinking bottled water... I interfered in these matters. Only when I dug deeper I came to know... that in the future, even getting water would become a struggle. A grave danger is approaching. One India, One Pipeline! This scheme, inaugurated by Chief Ministers from the three states is touted to be the solution to water problems. But this is the beginning of the water business. They will do business until stocks last. Once they run out of stocks, they'll shut down shops. Similarly, it happened in Capetown, and people struggled to get water. They waited in queues at the departmental stores. Citing day zero, even young kids were parched of water. Like Capetown suffered from water scarcity in Cochabamba, Bolivia people suffered despite being rich in water resources. A private water distribution company... shot people who went to fetch water from the river. People were called thieves for fetching the water that rightfully belongs to them. A rule was imposed not even to conserve rainwater. Riots, military, and oppression. They tortured the people. It was a disaster! This did not stop with Bolivia. Argentina, Philippines. This conflict extended to our neighboring country, Pakistan. History will repeat! This is going to happen in our country too. Instead of treating water as a source or a resource, we are now used to seeing it as a business product. We got used to buying water. Someone is going to take advantage of our habit. They are going to take away water from us. They will hide it without delivering the water. It will create a demand. Price will be hiked! Finally, people will suffer. Rathore and Oasis are not just water companies. Mafia! Water Mafia! Millions are fighting against the scheme across the world. But we don't stand a chance before Rathore. To stop them, if anyone has any means, please do advise. I'll do whatever it takes. Timmy has Sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease. You say we won't water to even splash on flowers. This bottle contains a dangerous chemical called BPA. It is non-traceable. You don't spare even the well dug out for agriculture. Cooking water costs ten rupees per pot. I can't test bottled water. It's a huge public health disaster! They buy it for 600 and sell it for 60,000. I'm saying there will be no flowers. Hold it. Here you go! Sister! - Don't drink this. - Why? - Drink boiled water. - Boiled water? Tell me! Viji, it's urgent! Come straight to Sameera's house. What are you doing at the restricted site? I came to prove that Sameera is not guilty. But only after I reached here, I learned she did it. Look, this is Rajaji Bhavan's blueprint from 1974. How did she know about RAW Record Room's secret entrance? Who must've given her the key? She knew that Police would use jammers. Someone has taught her to use that window to enter the building. She removed the document during that window. She was not alone. Someone else is pulling the strings. Mission failed! Sameera is dead. Chetta, only Sameera has died. The red letter is still out there. Neither CBI nor RAW or Rathore has it yet. Sameera was well aware of the danger. But for whom? Why did she take such a significant risk? Sardar! We should make sure Sardar gets the red letter. Where is Sardar? Only this morning, I got handed over Sameera's belonging. Look, there are so many train tickets. As far as I know, she never traveled. If she did not travel... She went to the station to meet someone. At the court... I saw a man in a wheelchair giving her a ticket. That means it was their meeting time and place. Look, there's a train ticket for tomorrow morning, 04:30 a.m. Sameera kept meeting someone regularly. If we get a hold of him. We can get Sardar. Tomorrow you better be at the railway station at 04:30 a.m. - What's the time? - 02:30 a.m. Let's go! They're calling it CODE-RED and Red Letter. She asked to deliver a hamper. We were going to mail a letter to Santa Claus. Where is Sardar? Bangladesh - Chittagong Central Prison. Bangladesh? Is it the fort prison? Is it the prison that was in the news for ongoing riots? Exactly! Attack! Alert officers! For 32 years, they kept shifting him, and finally, they're holding him in Chittagong prison. Riot alert in D-block! Inform CRT! Emergency! Come in right now! The situation is out of control. Open the D-block gate. Step back! Step back! - Emergency lockdown! - Sir, okay, sir. We need backup right now! Are you carrying arms? - Hey, do you have keys to 1408? - Yes, I do. Who is inside 1408? He must've gone rusty after 32 years in prison. What would he do? On seeing him, the prisoners will fear. You want a criminal to help us. Aren't you ashamed to seek the help of a prisoner? We are uniformed officers! Form a line! Form a line! Form a line! Form a line! Sardar is the best agent created by India, Chetta. He's not a rusty weapon you peg him for. He's a nuclear weapon! He's a dangerous nuclear warhead! Who is he? He's the unknown, madam. For the past 32 years, he has been locked up in this prison. We don't know his original name. You say he's in the prison over 30 years... How come there are no details about him? No, madam! He holds eight passports. He could speak 24 languages. We would've interrogated him 600 times. Every time it's a new language and a story. And the lie detector confirms it's the truth. If he could open the door with just a star... he could've escaped long ago! Sardar is not locked in a prison. It's penance! Why is he still here? Is he waiting for something? If you wish Sardar to come out of prison, all we need to do is disturb his penance. It's enough that the red letter reaches him. - Do you know who this King is? - No, sir. He is my ancestor. My grandfather! At present, his identity has no value. Do you know why? Because he believed power lies in conquering the land. The land is not power. Water is where power lies. One who controls water... controls the world! This project was not devised overnight. It's a long-term scheme for fifty years. I'm at the cusp of making history! Nothing should hinder this project. Why did the Code Name - Sardar surface after 32 years? Who's responsible for it? A cockroach is wandering on the surface. Find and crush it! Don't mess this up! I'm sure this person must be on the platform. You stay here I'll climb up and keep a watch. Sir! Sir! Hello... Viji! Over here. Look over here! Sir! Hey, stop right there! Sardar? Sir! Hey! - Arumugam... - Sir! Find out the last location these sim cards were active. - Right, sir. I'll find out. - Okay. Okay. Viji, the IDs we recovered from the deceased are all fake. He is a complete Ghost! Sir, there's no name or address. The seal and stamp look strange. What is this, sir? - When did this arrive? - Just now! Immediately contact the Indian Embassy. Tell them we have received Code-Red! Sir, we have received Code-Red from Bangladesh. From which ID? It was not from an ID but through a post. That's an old protocol from 1980. I need the list of inmates over Fifty years old from Bangladesh prison. This is regarding the prisoner you're holding in Cell♪ 1408. You are in possession of a highly dangerous agent ever trained by Indian Intelligence. Is he aware of the Red Letter? No, he doesn't! Good! I'm coming over. I need to investigate and find out the truth. Bear this in mind. He should not know about the Red Letter. Okay, sir! Sir, Bangladesh received Code-Red. Sardar - Chittagong Jail. - Have they issued the kill order? - Not yet, sir. Call the National Security Advisor. - Yes! - This is Bangla High Command. Yes, sir. The head of Indian Research and Analysis is with us. Okay, sir. We got the information that Sardar is in your custody. Sardar is extremely dangerous. Shoot him down at point-blank range. There's no need to follow any execution protocol. No one should even be aware that a person like Sardar existed. Sir, what is the protocol for Code-Red? Rightfully, we should hand over the Indian RAW agent to them. One of the officers informed me that he would take him away. Another officer has asked to execute him. Something is wrong sir. Sir, this is not our headache. Let us hand him over to India. Later, let them decide what they want to do with him. Just obey your orders! Kabir, take over. Viji, I traced the sim cards of the deceased. It shows only one location. It seems to be a forest. And there's no habitat. But there's an abandoned petrol bunk. We have not had any information for the past 32 years on him. Indian Agent. Pegs himself to be a super-spy. A rogue agent! His own country has ordered to execute him. No need to follow protocol. Orders are to shoot him at point blank. I have killed many people. This old fool has to die in my hands. Any last wish? Agent Sardar, any last words? Who trained you? What? I asked who trained you. Have you lost your mind? I think being locked up turned you crazy. Die damn it! This is how you point a gun at point-blank range. Did no one teach you that pointing at the forehead will give you a chance to escape? Don't move! Sir... Sardar escaped! I'm going to write down the truth about him. They say, "Big things have small beginnings." This was the beginning of the grave danger that's approaching us. An old shepherd. And the stone he brought. - What is this? - The stone has no moss on it. So what? Three days ago, there was moss on all the stones. Now there's no moss on all the stones near the river. Even the goat refuses to drink water. Where is this stream flowing from? Sir, it's from Pakistan. We received a piece of information from the Punjab border. They're planning to poison the Wular Lake at India-Pakistan border. It's the single source of drinking water for 4000 villages surrounding it. Not even one parched soul will have water to drink if this lake is poisoned. So what are we waiting for? Send out our troops and protect that lake. That's where the problem lies, sir. That lake is at the foothill. We can't gauge from which side the Pakistan army would attack us. If we send them blind... In the blink of an eye the entire battalion will be wiped out. They will poison the lake. And poof! They'll be on their way. So, what do you want us to do? Sit here like ducks! Before our troops arrive... we should know Pakistan army's plan of action. General Yusuf is stationed at the Pakistan army camp beyond the Pathankot border. Yusuf? You sure? Inside the General's tent, a command letter will be in a sealed envelope. We need to get our hands on that letter. But there's a small problem. If the letter goes missing or if the seal is broken... Yusuf will change the plan. So, the letter should remain as it where. Neither the seal should be broken. At the same time, should read the content of the letter. Your Highness, this sounds like a mission impossible. Do we have an agent who could do it?

We were a troop of 240. An entire battalion! Let alone our fellow soldiers. We could not even see the enemy due to the thick fog! We did not know what to do. We stood there clueless due to the thick fog. At the right time, our spy gave us a hint. Great! Had he not hinted to us at the right time... What? - Soup. - Don't pile on. Put it down. - ...we would have died. - Thank God! God bless him! Why didn't the postman deliver it sooner? Postman? That was a spy! Poor thing. He risked his life to save the soldiers. I pray for his well-being. What happened? Nothing. I was hemming the skirt, and the needle pricked. Why would you want to marry him? He's stitching a skirt for another woman. I'm playing the female character too. Hey! Bloody thespian! Dad, that's enough! Join us for the meal. Place a leaf for him too. - Did the kids eat? - Yes, they did. - Did you get hurt? - You first eat! - Yes, mom. - As if it's a war wound. This is the only way you'd see blood. Stop nitpicking. Your father was a thespian too. I take after my grandfather. He performed during the freedom struggle. Don't compare your sleazy play to his noble efforts. Bose, you got a gig. There's a call for you at Nattayar's shop from an agent. - Shall I say you're busy? - Wait, I'm coming! Hey, don't leave without eating. It would've been great if you were this eager to join the army. I did give it a fair chance. But they failed me on purpose. As if the Indian Army conspired to fail you. Bose, you topped in all the selection categories. But we failed you on purpose. It's not like you would've won medals like your brothers. Intelligence officers won't receive medals or recognition. Even after a successful mission no parade or appreciation. But if you fail, complete responsibility is yours! There may be an actor in every town. But it's hard to find an army officer. There may be an army officer in every town. But it's hard to find a true artist. Like how your grandfather played many parts for the sake of the nation... you, too, should play many parts. From now on, your identity is not Bose... You have been assigned a code name. SARDAR I have told you not to hire underage boys. Bose! Bose, the agent, will call you in five minutes. Okay. - I will speak to the agent. - Take your hands off. Every time you go to different towns to perform. But when I arrive, neither you nor will your troop be seen. Tell me the truth. Are you having an affair? Yes! I have a girlfriend in every town. Be careful when you drive. You may hit one of my children. - Tell me, agent! - Agent, Sardar! I need to debrief the mission. Tell me, agent. Where are we performing? Note down the frequency number. Agent, please don't hang up. I need to speak to you. - Can't you be quiet? - Hello! - Hello? - Please give me the date. 856000 MHz - As if it's a military secret. - Hey! Hello, Agent; where are you from? Hello? Sardar? You don't get it, do you? Should I say it out loud? If you don't stop following me, I'll kill you. Agent, I'll be there! What happened? Why are you crying? It's nothing! Let it go! Frequency number! Sardar, are you going to butcher a goat? It's a wounded goat. It will warn you when someone arrives. Did you find out why did Pakistan try to poison the lake? I found out. There's a vast conspiracy behind it. When I was done with my mission... I saw a file with a dragon symbol on General Yusuf's desk. Only after I read it, I understood the conspiracy. The plan was executed by Pakistan. But it was a Chinese that planned everything. China? In all the communication between Pakistan and the Chinese, the name Laughing Buddha is often used. Shadow Operation! Let's file a report that the Chinese are behind the conspiracy, and begin the investigation. No, don't mention anything about China in the report. For now, report it as Pakistan. Sir, why should we lie? We have the truth with us. Sardar, you're overestimating the truth. Truth Alone Triumphs! It is the biggest lie there is. In 1974, at the Turkmenistan-India border, a Russian truck carrying three-tonne plutonium toppled. Plutonium? Isn't it used to make dangerous nuclear weapons? Yes! As India got its hands on the truck, the world believed that India had plutonium. That's a lie. The truck was not carrying plutonium. But Sodium! Enemy countries that believed India got plutonium kept a safe distance from India. That is the power of a lie. Let Chinese be under the impression that we suspect Pakistan. We'll investigate without the knowledge of China. How do we do that? Chinese cockroach! Cockroach! He's the only agent who could infiltrate China and extract intelligence. He was last spotted at Kaho, Arunachal Pradesh. Go and meet him. You'd find a lead for this mission. Sit down. Hey, bring us tea. Hurry up! Sardar, please put that down. I have observed for the past five to six years the Chinese top think tanks were busy with a secret mission. The name of the mission is, One Nation One Pipeline. I stole this blueprint from the Canton vault to extract the information. Canton Vault? Cockroach can approach anywhere! Look at this. - Do you understand any of it? - No, sir. I, too, don't get it. The blueprint is all over. The pipeline road and China has no connection. A pipeline of this kind can't be laid in China. That's when I got your intelligence report. The blueprint that did not make sense on the China map... What if we place it on the India map? It connected all the dots. This is not a gas pipeline. Not an oil pipeline. Water pipeline! The scheme was not for China but India. It's impossible. It can't be done! Polyethylene Terephthalate People call it PET as an acronym. What can we do with it? It was you who prevented Pakistan from mixing poison in Wular Lake. Yes, sir. The Chinese knew you'd stop them. Their notion was not to mix poison in the water. In the pretense of mixing poison, they instilled fear in people. China made sure the news spread to surrounding 4000 villages. After that, do you think people would you dare to use that water? They will not! Two years ago, they issued licenses in Calcutta to install plastic bottle factories. The factories will be built near Wular Lake. The water people feared using the companies would fill the same water in plastic bottles sell to the public, and they would buy it. It's a hard written rule that water should not have a price tag. It also states Truth should not have a price tag. But no one follows. Even now, there's no price tag on water. The price tag is for a plastic bottle, label, and cap. They put a price on the water in the pretense of pricing the bottle. How could Chinese execute this in our country? Water gives that superpower. The Chinese knew WORLD WAR III would be fought for water. They started the groundwork to bring water resources across the world under their control. Now their attention has turned toward India. Water, which used to be a natural resource, has been changed into a product. Now you can buy water. If you could buy, you can sell. If you can sell, you can control. Slowly, they will instill the habit of paying for water. The scheme that begins with a bottle will end up as a pipeline in the next fifty years. Using the pipeline, China will control the water supply in India. Again, how could Chinese execute this in India? A top official from the Indian circle of power is working for China. They have given him a name... Laughing Buddha! Bang on! You find out who Laughing Buddha is. Only if we find him, could we stop the Chinese. Sardar calling Highness! Sardar calling Highness! I met the cockroach. Did you find the link between Pakistan and China? China has etched out big conspiracy. A top official in India is Laughing Buddha. We need to find him. It's easy to spot an enemy, but it's tough to spot a traitor. You continue with your investigation. And I'll do my part. Over and out! Okay, sir. Over and out! You're a terrorist. Now that you found out, go and sleep. I know everything. Are you doing this to hurt your father? Hey, idiot, shut up and leave. He loves his country. If he knows, he'll kill you! - I'm going to tell him. - Don't you dare speak! What would you do? I will tell the people. - I'll announce it, everyone. - Hey! Why don't you understand? - I'll strangle you to death. - Come on, kill me! When you could hit me, you could kill me too. - Kill me! - Hey! I'm not what you think. I work for the Government. But I can't tell anyone. Understood? How do I trust you? You don't trust me, is it? Why should I trust you? There's nothing between us. Are you my husband? Or do you plan to marry me? Why do you always come back to it? To me, this is important. While growing up, the entire town said we're made for each other. You, too, loved me. Suddenly three years ago, you changed. You started being mean to me and got distant. And you started lying to me. I feel cheated. I'm telling you the truth. It does not matter. Do you like me or not? That's all I want to know. I like you. - But I can't marry you. - Why? It's for your good. My profession does not allow me to. Perhaps you may die. What about your sisters-in-law? Aren't they living with their soldier husbands? The nation will bid them farewell with military honor if my brothers die. But if I die... the nation will abandon me! Understood? The nation may say your brothers might not return. But there will be no one to say that you won't return. I will live with the hope that one day you will return. That's all I need. You're a bigger fool than I thought. If you don't want me to lie to you... you should not ask me questions. Tell your father that I will marry you. What did you say? I can't repeat it. As far as they are happy. I repeat. He's not good for you.

Lieutenant, I'll see you down in a while. Okay, sir! I know you have been investigating a person. I want you to stop that investigation. Don't mess with Laughing Buddha. I hope you understand. All these years, your family lived as royals. But now you draw a pension from the Government. I will enthrone you as the King. Five crores! Your Highness, your silence says it all. I think you'll make the right decision. Sardar calling Highness! Sardar calling Highness! Sardar calling Highness! Your Highness responding, Sardar. Sir, I found out who Laughing Buddha is. What? Come again! Indian National Security Advisor, P.K. Abraham. Sardar, what evidence do you have? The Chinese drew the pipeline blueprint using Bhaskara Satellite images. P.K. Abraham signed and gave the images to them. During the Calcutta conference, P.K. Abraham signed the approval for plastic bottle factories. I completely checked his telephone records. All the trunk calls were made to China. Calcutta, Bombay and Delhi I witnessed him meeting the Chinese officials. I'm sure Laughing Buddha is P.K. Abraham. Sardar, you are accusing National Security Advisor. He's an ardent patriot! Why should he abandon his ideals and work for China? In India, an individual needs a minimum of five litres of water daily. If you put a price on it... with the population in our country, it's not a small business. It's a business of ten trillion! How much did you say, Sardar? Ten Trillion! We have to catch him! Sardar, you don't seem to get it. Regardless of the evidence, we collect, eventually, the file will land on his table. Only his signature will turn that file into an intelligence report. He works for China. Every minute he's in power, we are closer to danger. Sardar, what can we do about it? He's at the epicenter of the circle of power. He is untouchable. It's not like we can kill him. We have to put an end to him. I will do it. Sardar, do you understand what you're saying? I hope you're aware of the consequences of killing the National Security Advisor. I know, sir. I will be labeled a traitor. I cannot step foot in India. The government will abandon me. I don't care. The future of my country is important. I'm ready to sacrifice for the sake of my country. I too have a child. Our children should not be in a state where they must pay for water. Okay, Sardar. Where is the backup of the evidence did you gather? I have safely stashed it at my house. Alright, Sardar, this is an unofficial mission. There will be no record of me approving this mission. Abraham is in Bangladesh. You go ahead and assassinate him. Bose! Where are you going? To catch termites for chicken feed. I'll be back. I will declare you a National Traitor. Later I'll send Code-Red and bring you back. I won't return until you prove Abraham is the traitor and send me a Red Letter. Jai Hind! Jai Hind! - Abraham here. - You're exposed, Mr. Abraham! What? Sardar is coming for you. - Sir, where are you headed? - To the event hall. I gave him your exact location. I know you want money. How much do you need? You were buying me off for millions for a business valued at trillions. I don't want the money. I want it all! You're messing with the forces beyond your ken. I'm well aware of your ken! But you don't know Sardar. He will not stop for anything. He won't stop until the mission is accomplished. Anyway, this was your idea. I could not hold myself back. So, I would like to thank you before your death. Thank you very much! Guards! Guards... Sardar calling Highness! Sardar calling Highness! Tell me, Sardar. Laughing Buddha is in my custody. The mission going to end. I will kill him and go underground. - Sir, I have a request. - Tell me, Sardar. Please tell my father... ...the truth! The world is going to call me a traitor. My father can't bear it. Please tell him the truth. He's Ex-Army. He will understand. Sure, Sardar! Take it that your father already knows. - Jai Hind! - Jain Hind, sir! It's a black day for our nation. What did this nation give us? Name your price. The agent I created betrayed me. National Security Advisor P.K. Abraham has been abducted. I'm the National Security Advisor! Your life will be destroyed. Agent Sardar has gone Renegade. Drop your weapons now! This is the Bangladeshi Coast Guard. Oh, God, no! How could he do this to us? How could he do it? - Dad, please calm down. - Let go! We will die of shame. Dad, don't get angry. Please calm down. Rathore destroyed all the evidence Sardar gathered. And resigned from his job. I resign all powers and authorities given to me by this Government. The next day, he turned into the new Laughing Buddha to sign an agreement with China. His lie pushed Sardar's family to commit suicide. Sardar, unaware of the truth to get underground, on purpose, got caught by Bangladeshi Coast Guard He's holding too many passports! Tell me, who are you? ...and is locked up in prison for the past 32 years. But I know this was not the end. One day Sardar will return to the dead drop zone known only to us. I have stashed the truth over there that happened over the years. He believed in Rathore's lies and lost everything. At present, Sardar is labeled as a traitor! Muruga! Muruga! Muruga! Muruga! Muruga! Muruga! Muruga! Muruga! Muruga! The pipeline scheme Sardar wanted to destroy at its inception has transformed into a dangerous truth at present. Only Sardar could dare to destroy the scheme. If he's not able to accomplish it. Then God save us all. The selfless spy who lost everything is our last hope. Because... Once a spy... Always a spy! This is the Indian Army's largest confiscation vault. Things we recovered last from Sardar are locked in this vault. What exactly are you looking for? For a clue! A location! Sardar must have arrived at the dead drop zone. Let's look for any details or documents related to that location. Viji, who is this Sardar you asked to investigate? His name is giving shivers to people. They're talking about some Red Letter. Mom promised me that we'd mail a letter to Santa Claus. I think it's a very complicated case. Hey, say something! Viji, do you hear me? Sardar's makeup box, field glasses, radio, that's all we have with us. Fine! I need to interrogate Sardar's batch mates, friends, and acquaintances. Most importantly, I need to interrogate Sardar's Spy Master, Rathore. Just obey your orders, Chandramohan. Kill Sardar and close the file. Sir, we are the Research and Analysis Wing. We can't do research or analysis. What are we, then? What do you know about Rathore? Do you realize the position he holds? He's a bloody advisor to the Government. How can you interrogate him? I'll question him, and he will answer. The lie detector will validate his answers. - That's it! - Is it so? You shoot your questions, and I'll answer. Let's follow protocol. State your name. My name is Sardar. 1982 batch. Field Operations - R & AW The world calls me a traitor. To be honest, I did not commit any crime. You may question me. I will answer. But you can't find the truth. I am Sardar's, Spy Master! Without my help, you can't catch him. Everybody back to work! Sardar did not escape on his own. Someone instigated him to break out of prison. If you wish to capture Sardar... we need to catch the person who posted the Red Letter. Find the source! - Uncle, start the vehicle. - Where to? I'll explain later. Timmy has a guardian name, Victor. Call Kathir and find out who dropped Timmy at Victor. I need Victor's address. Uncle? - Sir! - Meet Pavadasamy. For 32 years, he raised him under surveillance. Instead of a special care home, he raised him in his house. I thought love would eclipse duty. But not bad. He has done his job, sir. Dad, what are you doing? - Go inside. - What is happening? Sir, Vijay Prakash was speaking about Victor. Victor is the guardian of Timmy. If we get hold of Victor, we can capture Sardar. Victor... Check in the records if RAW enlisted someone named Victor. You won't find anything in the records. Agents that retired from RAW before 1990... would have changed their identities. RAW does not even hold any photographic records of those agents. The only records we have are their fingerprints! We'd know he worked for RAW... if Victor came down and validated his prints. Secure Victor immediately! Find out if he's an agent. How did the boy's guardian look? One second, sir. An older man in a wheelchair. Victor, sir! The best I can do is give you two hours. Before we run out of time, bring your father and make him surrender. For my eyes only. Understood? Sir? Victor, sir? Victor... Sir, please trust me. This file has all the truth about my father. The traitor is someone else. I am aware! But no one would believe it. Victor, sir! We have secured, Victor. I repeat. We secured, Victor. Approaching headquarters! They brought Victor to the ground floor. Premnath, bring him to the top floor. Sir, please give me five minutes with Victor. I will find out where my father is. - I just need five minutes! - I'll give you three. Pick up! Pick up! Pick up! Biometrics are ready, sir. Over! Approaching the biometric room, sir. Santa! Partner! You need a fingerprint to open it. Oh, God, not your fingerprint. His attire states that he's an official. Use his fingerprint. Chetta! Chetta! Bose... Chinese scheme is going to be a success. You will have to stop it from happening. Sir, someone has entered the Confiscation Vault. I repeat. The goods inside the vault are dangerous... It contains weapons and explosives right from 1960 to date. We have no clue what he would do or pick inside the vault. Fingerprint! Sir, I don't have access to the vault. Then cut the power! We kept looking for you. His mother sacrificed her life to bring you out. Sardar, it's all in your hands now. Where have they stashed my belongings? It's at RAW South Indian Headquarters. Confiscation Vault: Level-3 Open the vault! Fast! Fast! It's 1343, partner! So, this is your little brother? It's old technology. Sir, we're inside the vault. What are they wearing as goggles? It's night vision goggles, partner. I have seen it in video games. Even in the dark, you can see clearly. Call NSG! It'll take fifteen minutes for NSG to arrive. But he will escape before they arrive. He won't! He just passed out. He will wake up in a while. Partner! Sardar reporting for duty, sir! Sardar! I believe that's the little brother. So, that microfilm holds all the evidence. To the world, you're a traitor! No one would believe you, Sardar, even if you shouted at the top of your voice. All these years, I have been a consultant to this Government. And have completed many prestigious projects. If you go and tell people I'm a Chinese agent, no one will believe you. You're an uncomfortable truth. I'm a convenient lie! You picked up a street artist... and made him an agent to serve the country and do good. I lied to my entire family. You're the only person I never lied to. I trusted you with my life! You did not trust me, Sardar. You trusted the lie I told you. I'm going to tell you the truth. Let's see if you believe it. I went to your house to inform that you're a traitor. Sir, I believe you'd bring back my husband. Please send him the Red Letter and bring back Bose. How do you know about Red Letter... Bose never told me about it! I overheard you both on the radio. The future of my country is important. I'm ready to sacrifice for the sake of my country. - The entire conversation? - Yes, sir! You don't worry about him. I'll handle it! - Sir, I have a request. - Tell me, Sardar. Please tell my father the truth! The world is going to call me a traitor. My father can't bear it. I will tell him, Sardar. Take it that your father already knows. I'll inform him. - Jai Hind! - Jain Hind, sir! HEY! What is the basic rule of an agent? When two people are talking, the agent must check if someone is eavesdropping. You are a very-very bad agent! File a report saying the patriotic family committed suicide as son turned a traitor. - Sir, what about the six-year-old boy? - No! We need at least one family member alive... to remind the world that Sardar is a traitor. Let the boy live. Had you been cautious, your family would've remained alive. Sardar, perhaps you'd want to kill me. Go ahead, Sardar. Come for my throat. Back then, it was just an idea when you were trying to prevent it. Now it is a larger-than-life EMPIRE. You have nothing to live for. True that! I have nothing to lose, Your Highness! Except for my mission. I'm not here for little brother, to expose the truth or to avenge you. I'm here to destroy your pipeline scheme! Don't forget that I assigned you to this mission. You only know how to bark orders sitting behind a radio. You never stepped foot into the field. You are used to assigning missions. And I'm used to accomplishing the mission. Wait and watch. I'm going to end it! Dad! Sir, he moved to Level-7. Sir, he moved to Level-7. Send men to Level 7. Block Level-7. Sir, I've arrived at Level 7! Sir. I've arrived at Level 7. He drove away in the plutonium truck from Level 7. Hey! No, no, do not engage! Inspector Vijay Prakash escaped. Is someone on corridor 7? Is someone on corridor 7? No one is here, sir. All clear! Hey, Viji! I feared they'd kill me if I did not arrest you. I am aware, uncle! Sir, in pursuit of the truck. Shall I fire? Do not fire! Do not engage! - Hold fire! - The truck contains plutonium. It would blow the entire city apart if something happened to the truck. Chandramohan, that truck does not contain Plutonium. - Just blast it! - Sorry, sir. Sardar, stop the vehicle! Stop the vehicle! You cannot give me orders! I repeat, stop the vehicle! Damn! Fall back! Idiots! RAW is of no help now. The truck does not contain Plutonium. Idiots don't seem to understand. Inside the truck... The truck did not contain Plutonium. But Sodium! Sardar, too knows it. I know what his plan is. Sir, Sodium is just salt. Fool, that's Sodium Chloride. Do you know what would happen if it mixes with water? It will explode like an atom bomb! Oh, that's a massive explosion. - Partner, are we going to do this? - Yes! Sardar is heading to the pipeline at Dasara Hills. If he dumps the sodium at the site, it will destroy our pipeline project. Shalini, the microfilm my father has got all the information we needed. It's enough if we get our hands on it. That'll prove Rathore is the traitor and my father is not. Viji, you can't prove anything with the microfilm. Rathore has perfectly established himself. It's impossible to break his image. Viji, no one from the mainstream media will publish this news. Read the headlines of our newspaper. Chief Ministers from three states are going to inaugurate it. No one would believe you if you told them it's dangerous. Why should we depend on Media? Let's make this viral. Gather our social media team. I'll get the microfilm. For that, you need to find your father. RAW and CBI are looking for him! How are you going to find him? - Do you still have Sameera's watch? - Yes! It will show Timmy's location. Share it immediately with me. Are you not able to see, partner? Give it to me. Switch on the light to view it. Check if there's a blueprint in it. I see a lot of drawings. Check for a big circle. It has something written in Chinese. What number do you see next to it? Erm... it says 3. We have to go there. Put it back. Partner, why do you have so many tablets? I need to take them daily. If I don't, I'll have trouble breathing while sleeping. I'm one of the reasons for your condition. Would you forgive me? If you're on the path to reform, you don't need forgiveness. You're a wise man, kid! He's going to dump sodium into the water at this base and is going to explode central pipeline of this factory. The truck should not get past the main gate! If the base explodes, it will destroy the pipelines we laid down at this base and One India One Pipeline! Show me the CCTV of Gate 3. What are we going to do partner? We're going to light up the pipeline and blast it! He's heading toward the hatch. Protect the hatch at all costs! Sir, he does not seem to slow down. He is going to crash the vehicle. If you open this lever, the truck will fall into the water. He should not come near the lever. Until I return, stay right here. Okay! I know that you are brave. Before I return, if the hatch opens up... Do you see the red board out there? - Go beyond it and stand. - Why? That's the blast radius. If you're beyond that line the blast won't harm you. Okay? What if it blasts before you return? That means I won't come back. Partner, without me, who's going to help you navigate? Here you go. It has a compass. Use it to find your way back. Sardar, I trained you! You cannot surprise me. But I will surprise... you! Sir, we are covered in steam! We are covered in steam. Vision compromised. We can't see anything. Vision compromised. It's a negative on Sardar. I repeat. Vision negative on Sardar. Sir, we have no clue where he is. Vision negative! We cannot see, Sardar. I repeat we cannot see Sardar. Where is Sardar? Where is Sardar? Where the hell is Sardar? Somebody respond! Somebody bloody respond! Sir, we are not able to move the truck. Open valve 2 and release the water. Sir, what about the CM inauguration? I said open the bloody pipes! If you open the pipes in just ten minutes, the water will reach 300 villages. After that, if he dumps the sodium into the water, not just the central pipeline but all the pipelines will explode. The surrounding 300 villages will get destroyed. Sardar would never let that happen. Release the water! Okay, sir. Move it! Timmy, what are you doing here? Viji, is that you? Partner's mission is going to fail. - Come with me. - What are you saying? Come on. We need to close the valve. How do you know all this? I saw the blueprint. Come with me. Come on, keep moving. Right over there is the valve. They are going to open that valve. How do we close it? Oh, no, it did not mention in the blueprint. Switch on the power. We need to open the valve. We need to open the pipes. Hurry up, switch on the power. Come on, hurry up! Fast! Fast! Sir, we tried to switch on the power. But someone prevented us from doing it! I broke the controller! It's a 3.5-tonne valve. Let's see how you're going to close it. I'm not going to stop you. Look over there. The water supply is on. Viji, please wake up. We need to close the valve. Mission will fail, Viji. Wake up, Viji. The water has reached the surrounding ten villages. Go ahead, open the hatch! Dump the Sodium. This site and the surrounding ten villages will be destroyed too. There will be no survivors. Viji, wake up! Help partner, Viji. If we don't stop the water supply, the mission will fail. Now tell me, Sardar... is your mission important or the people? You have failed, Sardar. Your mission... ...is a failure. Sir, come in, sir! Hello? Respond! Sir, may I say something? You're a worst agent. Didn't you mention that a third person should not eavesdrop? But I heard it. - Who are you? - Your worst nightmare! Timmy, hold this. Partner, accomplish the mission! Sardar... don't open it. Even if God blesses them with water, the people will flow it down the drain. But they will not even waste a drop of the water I offer. It's because they paid for it. I'm the savior who is saving the water from these ungrateful people. Do you know something? In a year... six lakhs children die of thirst in our country. Not due to scarcity. Due to unavailability. The bottled water you sell, and when a person cracks open the bottle to drink, it's equal to strangling the next generation! People treated water well before business people like you stepped in. Let people take care of the water. People know how to conserve water. No... No! Sardar! Sardar! - Let's go, Viji. - Where? Beyond the blast radius. Blast radius? Yeah! Don't you know it's going to explode? Is it going to explode? What the hell? Sardar! How will you fail? I trained him. Partner! I thought I'd never get to meet you. You must be angry with me. I was angry, dad. I despised you! I blamed you for the bad name I got into the department. Department? Yes, partner. He's a Police inspector. Police? Your grandfather would've been very proud. Dad, we need to tell everyone the truth. Please give me the microfilm I'll handle it. It's tough to live a life bearing the truth. This truth killed your mother. For the past 32 years, the country has trusted Rathore. If the people learn that he's a traitor and a Chinese agent, they will lose trust in the Government. That should never happen. Let the world believe... that terrorist Sardar destroyed the pipeline scheme. Let Rathore remain a good person. And let me remain the villain. Dad! Dad! Why did you throw it away?

Your father Bose wishes to. But Sardar... Once a spy... always a spy! Am I right, partner? Every father is an unsung hero! Just like a spy! They don't get to enjoy their worldly things, nor are they remembered after their demise. Their existence will be unknown. And history won't speak of them. No one would come to know the story of a spy like Sardar, who never cared for identity or recognition. But the fruits of his sacrifice, millions would bear it. No one will know the truth. If the truth comes out, someone somewhere would not lose their life looking for recognition and would believe performing their duty is happiness. Once a spy... Always a spy!

Most importantly, teach your children respect for water. That will do! You have destroyed a vital Government operation. Therefore you're dismissed from the Police force. I made them do it. You're the son of a traitor. That's your identity. And our advantage. It'll be easy to earn the enemies' trust. But are you willing to work for me as an agent? Yes, sir! Good! We'll start with Cambodia. Every agent going on a mission will have a code name. Your code name is...
