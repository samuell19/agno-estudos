[Footsteps] [Thumping noises] [Birds chirping] [Wind howling] [Engine rattling] Yup. 1982. This is it. This is the battlefield. He was here. Maybe he still is. The poet warrior. They don't make them like that anymore. We're gonna find him. [Typewriter clicks] [Margot sighs] [Typing noises] It's done. Mona's Collision? I'm sending it today. No more rewrites, no more edits... No more second-guessing myself. It is what it is. Well, I'm proud of you, muffin top. [Clicks key] [Typewriter clicking] ♪ Folksy music ♪ First time I saw Martin was in film school. He had a poetry book in the back pocket of his jeans. It was a copy from a Guatemalan poet... which happened to be my favorite. I kissed him right there on the spot. After graduation, we tried our best. We really did. Writing scripts no one wanted to read. Paying prices we couldn't afford. We were broke. [Margot laughs] With nothing to lose. [Indistinguishable yelling] So, we decided to search. Escape winter. Travel south. He can't feel homesick if there's no home to go back to. He wanted to hunt them down. The great poet that brought us together. Our two-man search party for legendary commander... La Bestia. Even if that meant following a dead man's trail. It was known that he had left behind a diary. His greatest piece unpublished... Untarnished... Unread. Containing all the answers to questions I never dare ask. Like, "What the hell are we doing here?" [Car engine sputters] [Car engine hisses] [Door slams] [Scraping noises] Have you checked the catalytic converter? [Slams hood shut] [Birds chirping] [Foreign language over radio] Did you come? I think you should be able to tell. It feels like we're just going through the motions. Welcome to adulthood, buddy. Oh, but this isn't what I signed up for.

Capitalism can cause impotence sometimes ♪ Soft music ♪ [Typerwriter clicking] [Sighs] [Slams chair] [Shuts door] [Flipping pages] [Screams] Sold it. [Lighter flicks] Margot, you can't smoke in here I'm celebrating, Martin. I sold it, well Mmm... Well, it's not actually sold but it's optioned. Fuck the no smoking sign. You did it. I'm proud of you. Your eyes are googly. Why? [Sips coffee] No reason... Congratulations. Margot, should we break up? Happy anniversary to you too. Are you sleeping with someone else? [Martin laughs] No. Gloria? Assistant director Gloria? God no, scriptwriter Gloria? What, I can't have pictures of my friends? You sent her your last short. Gloria writes great dialogue. Mmm... She's too latino pretty for you. [Martin chuckles] And you were too caucasian pretty for me. Screw this. Good luck with all your future feature film endeavors. Bye Martin. Wait, wait, don't go! Look, this isn't right. No shit, this isn't right. You're breaking up with me. I hope you write freaking indie student short films 'till you're a sad forty year old man wearing skinny jeans and moss green cardigans. Have a nice surburban life with your bleach Mexican illiterate foster child. Wait, don't go! I hate skinny jeans. And plus, I can't pay for my tea. Look, I'm sorry for screwing things up, Margot. This means the world to me. Let's finish together. Well, just for the record, this whole wild goose chase for La Bestia was your idea. Uh, no it wasn't. Uh, yeah it was. Just give me a minute to collect myself. And I won't be manipulated by an artsy cunt like you. Fair enough! [Flicking lighter] Martin, what is this about? I mean... uh you're just so... ambitious and beautiful and bright, I figured you deserved someone better than me. I may not have all the answers, hell, I don't even know the question. But, I swear La Bestia does. And we're going to find him. Was there any other way you can vent out your insecurities without breaking up with me so early in the morning? Frankly, no. But... it was our duty to find La Bestia and write beautiful things We're screenwriters. It's our job to save the world from itself. If not us, then who? If not now, then when? And if not here, then where? And besides, I still care about you! And that's enough. So you'll stay? [Moaning] What day is it? I think it's the 21st. This time it will work. No. No. No, I don't want to go there. Go where? The Caribbean coast, you were just thinking that. How about the Pacific coast? We haven't been there yet. Maybe the Mayan biosphere jungles. That's where the war began. Maybe we could find some clues there. I feel like some place chilly.

He disappeared in the early eighties during the war. - Greatest mind of his genera- - Oh yeah, La Bestia. Nice kid Tragic ending though. You knew him? Oh yeah, I was touring with Dylan in the mid-seventies, somehow ended up down here around the same time La Bestia started reciting That's how we met. Ahah, and? And what? And what was he like? You're the first person we've met who actually knew him. Well, no one ever really knew him. He was just this quiet young kid you'd see everywhere and nowhere all the time. The whole country knew his name, his name was trouble. Oh God, the voice he had. The voice of active volcanoes and earthquakes. Yeah. That's him. We need to find him. Oh, don't you know? He's dead. Uh, technically he was desaparecido. Euphemisms don't bring people back. No, gone is gone, kid. Did La Bestia leave behind a diary? Well, if he did, they probably burnt it. Well, maybe or maybe not.

Just follow your gut, have a little faith in serendipity, That's nothing like what the old man said. He says the diary is lost forever. I feel like he was just being elliptical. I'm so glad we're together. Well, I wouldn't share my poverty with anyone else. Martin, what are we doing? We are eking it out as screenwriters. Traveling abroad in Central America on a particularly frugal budget. On a self appointed mission To find the twentieth century greatest vanished poet. Maybe we should settle down. You mean like marriage? Hell no, not like marriage! More like coming to the terms that we're both nearly months from turning thirty and we still can't even afford a decent hostel with a hot shower. Well how was I supposed to know boutique meant no hot water? Besides we can just take a shower tomorrow when its warm out. Check out is 10 AM. Oh, right. I'm sure we can find something stable yet creative. Middle class wage yet not too demanding. Look, we've talked about this. There is no way in hell that I am going back to serving popcorn and sweeping those buttered floors, those teenagers are brats. I just feel like we're wasting our lives away. I don't think we can survive another year like this. I'm still listening. [Sighs] We've been doing this for so long and we're no closer to making it then when we graduated film school. And we're still in debt! And forever, will be! Sure, I 'optionspec' sometimes, but where's that actually ever gotten us? It got us here. Exactly. It got us here. Which is nowhere at all. [Urinating] I don't want to feel obsolete so soon. Pushed aside into the normalcy and routine and complete boredom by our accumulated failures. [Sniffs] [Grunts] But sweetness, the fight is our freedom. We are quite literally living the dream Waltzing up the border of obscurity wielding our passports with our Visas stamped by hunger, lonliness, and isolation. - Exhuastion. - Despair. Uncertainty and constant rejection and with that comes and with that comes no glory or dignity, no home of our own, no belonging anywhere. Oh, but we love the road.

We have this one golden opportunity to make something beautiful. Like, Charlie Kaufman beautiful? Yeah, something like that, I guess. Look, all I'm saying is that La Bestia is out there waiting for us. Let's just give it a little bit longer. Six months. A year. Eight months. Settle bumblebee, nine months. And what happens after then? Well, you'll still be bumblebee. And if we haven't made it by then, we'll grow up and settle down. And what's settling down for you? Sticking with your side. Not fucking it up, you mean? Uh, could be? Everyone for it, say 'I'. [Together] I! It's so cold in this place. Well didn't you spend the extra five q for the extra blanket when you paid? I thought you were going to pay this time? Start packing, woman. ♪ Soft music ♪ I once heard this story about his diary. When La Bestia was captured in battle, The young soldier found his diary and read it in hiding. The next morning, he had orders to execute the poet. And he did so, with tears in his eyes. They say that the young man died of a broken heart. When would that have been? [Crashing waves] Late winter, eighty three - somewhere around Guatamala city. - Thatr's not too far from here. Nah, I bet we could find an old friend or lover there. or at least a police record. Or maybe an unpublished diary? It's the biggest city in Central America, don't get greedy. Hey, by the way your boobs look bigger today. Real classy. More supple, one might even say. Stop it! Yes, dear. [Typewriter clacking] [Sighs] How do you love someone who sucks so much at the one thing they're supposed to be good at? [Sighs] I'm with you, Martin, isn't that good enough? It never is. You, on the other hand, your non-linear plot structures are always impeccable. You should write sweet nothings for a living. Well, seeing as I already live to write nothing Lord knows I'm tryin'. Hey Martin [Gasp] We need to talk. [Whispers] No, that's bad. Okay, um. Um...[Blows raspberry] Okay... Martin... Um... We, we have something to discuss. Do you want to sit down for a sec? No. No, not a dog. Um... Okay... I can do that. Yeah, so can I. Don't partonize me, Martin. Just because you're a feminist doesn't mean I can''t make supper for us every so often.

[Dogs barking] Siete. Mr. and Mrs. Smith? Amazing chemistry in that movie, very solid plot. Congratulations, you guys are pregnant. It's not my fault I have some condition. Some sort of a fertility talent. Three or four weeks. [Martin and Margot] Huehuetenango.

I think we found it. [Roaring waves] Where'd you get that from? I stole it from a mini mart 'cause I love you. You made me do it. Are you avoiding it? Avoiding what? Do you want to keep it? Do you have to call it 'it'? Wait, is that a trick question? I don't know, is yours a trick question? I have no idea. Wait, what are we talking about again? So do you want to be the mother of my child? We really screwed up. It's one thing to waste our youths because it's ours to do so but being pregnant with you is like... Like you never answer my question you always veer off into one of those wondering monologues. Yeah, let me finish. Everywhere we go we find nothing but wastelands. It's obvious you don't want to keep it. Don't call it that. It's obvious you don't want to keep the baby. Don't say that! That's something horrible to say. So do you? - It's okay if you don't. - Is it? I think so, honey badger. No... I don't think so I need time. Do we have time?

I'm sorry I said that... Well, that's okay. No, it's not. I'm turning into this really mean person that I don't want to be. It's like I'm possessed. You're not possessed, just pregnant. Yeah. With our baby. So, do you? What do you want me to do? Just hold me. [Soft music] [Radio chatter] Maybe we should split up. Cover more territory. Right? Yeah, it makes sense. [Engine whirring] [Slams door] [Melancholy music] [Rustling wind] How are you? I'm fine. The church reminds me of you. Cavernous, echoing with the voices of piety and redemption. Would you do it? I mean, could we? It might just be the only good thing we've ever accomplished together. Is there enough of a world left for a new life? Let's look at the facts. We love each other and if there's anyone I'd want to be stuck in this position with, it's you. And plus... We've got great genes, right? You're sweet, perhaps we can do it? You do have exceptional talent for character development And I have been known for one or two noteworthy plot twists. We've fared steeper odds before. If we have proven anything before, it's that we can thrive in this world of ruins. Wh should any of that change? I agree. We've always written beautifully together. I don't know why we couldn't raise a child as well. Couldn't be that hard. Sure, we'll probably both die in some tropical disease infested far of third world country. But it could be way worse. We could both be actors. [Soft music] I know nobody believes the old cliche anymore. But everything's going to be alright. Do I want to keep it? Screw Marlon Brando and The Waterfront set. We're going to be parents. [Mournful music] I got you coffee. You must be the sweetest girl this side of the Rio Pensativo. I found a lead. I found this at the bookstore. A postcard from a mountain view? Uh, not any mountain view I knew I'd seen this before, it's in the book that you have. It was his favorite hideout. [Chuckles] Would our baby even be safe in this country? I don't think we'll ever find a safe place for our baby. Well, should we get married? No. Why not? [Sighs] For people like us, a non disclosure agreement should be enough. We don't have to put pictures of it on social media. Hell, an elopment would do for me. Margot, will you elope me? For someone who specializes in cheesy romantic comedies, you're not that romantic. You know, my agent tells me that all the time You don't have an agent. She tells me that too. You probably shouldn't smoke anymore. You can't tell me what to do. Oh no, but that oversized GMO grapefruit belly of yours can. We are pregnant? You get so hurtful when you're chubby. You get so snarky when we're chubby. [Flicking lighter] Just yesterday, we were graduating from film school. I thought in a matter of weeks, we would sell some shitty buddhist horror script and overnight become the next Werner Herzogs'. Berlin festival darlings, Palm d'fucking Or and all that. That was years ago, Martin. We need to get our shit together. Maybe we should move back stateside. You're the one who wanted to find the poet warrior in Guatemala. When life in the north goes south, you follow it. And we've been hot on the trail ever since. I wouldn't turn back for the world. [Mock gun noises] Backup's gonna be here any minute now! They gonna crucify you for it. Drop the piece, Blankie. [Boston accent] Screw you, officer Allen! You backstabbing pig. Don't make this personal, buddy. You know you got it comin'. You shouldn't have done it, Blankie. The whole county is out looking for you now. I'll come at you with everything I got. All the muscle from the precinc. Can't you see those bastards are out for blood? Please don't make it hard for yourself. You're the one who broke my heart, A-Officer Allen. You were my best friend. I thought you'd always be there for me! Blankie, don't call me officer, please. Don't do that to me. Allen? Remember that bird, Maggie? From the diner on fifty first? Yeah, I remember. She was the first girl I kissed. The same summer you fell off the roof of that second story pawn shop. Nearly scared me to death, you little punk. I never told you this before... but I loved her, Al. Do you know how hard it is? To see you two, every day, together? I know, Blankie, I know. Al? Yeah, Blankie? No matter what happens- [Gun shots] [Police radio chatter] Blankie! I'm sorry pal, I shoulda done ya better! You were a great brother. [Wails] [Margot fakes police sirens] See, that's what I still don't get. A sniper shoots him through the window? Such an anti climax. What are you talking about? That's classic film noir trope. It's homage. - Personally, I think it's great. - I like it Do you really? - Of course I do. - Aw thanks. If I die will you take care of our baby? Psh. That escalated quickly. What the hell are you talking about? I just want to make sure. Of course I will. You hesitated. I'm afraid. Of what? Of screwing it up, like I have so many times before. Yeah, but that's normal. And, we both have. We all have at some point. Yeah, but this is different. My track record is unbeatable. Know how I was before I met you? Impossible? Exactly. [Dogs barking] We've grown up since. Didn't you just say we need to get our act together? No, I didn't. Look Margot, our favorite thing is a little play pretend each night. Yeah. You're right. Who am I kidding? The smell of patchouli in here is asphyxiating. They must have laced that mango chutney with arsenic. This will now be my death bed. [Sighs] It's so hot in here. I don't want to do in a cheap hostel attic. What a horrible third act. I've seen this film before, I know how it ends. [Whispers] I'm serious! I am too. Goodnight, my sweet prince. [Cats meowing] [Muffled yelling] How would you like to go camping? Fuck. Great. I'm tired. Well, what is it? The producers dropped the option. Too earnest, he said. He's not interested. It'll be alright, gingersnap, I'm sure. You'll find someone else to option it too. [Gentle music] Hi. You must be the baby. I am your... reluctant mother. Pleased to meet you. So listen, I'm just going to get to it if that's alright with you? Sometimes grown ups make decisions that... You're right, cut the crap. This is it. It wasn't supposed to be this way. I swear. Whatever that means. You'll be a precious baby, no doubt. Just not mine. So basically, what I'm trying to say here is- I'm sorry for all the trouble. [Sniffling] I truly am. I need to get this done. I can't do this, I'm sorry. You know I also hate the word termination? That doesn't matter. We gotta figure something else out. You coming? I just want to stay? [Soulful music] Who’s it for? It’s a gift. No, I didn’t remember I had it there. He brought it here to me, personally. Before he left to the mountain. The books are strange. This one was supposed to be sold in ’83. If you see him, do me a favor. Tell him this was the money I owed him. [Soft music] [Birds chirping] I was thinking, if and when Mona's Collision is sold to one of the big studios we can go buy a farm up in the highlands. I was just thinking that exact thing. Really? No. No, no, no. Well... I don't know how it'd all work but the goal is to go completely off grid. I've heard ducks and goats provide endless compost. And you could teach yoga retreats under avacado trees. I could learn to hammer things. So what do you think about going back home? Going back to whose home? Yeah, you're right. Certainly not ours. Yeah, we have no home. Besides we couldn't afford it. [Upbeat music] [Unintelligible whisper] I'm pregnant. Okay. But I'm getting an abortion soon. The father of my baby? Well, this baby. He's MIA right now. Okay. So, do you know anyone here? Well, these are all friends of friends of mine. I don't really know anyone here, except for you. Very different from the rest of Guatemala I've known. Yeah, it's pretty urban. More developed, you could say. More fake too. Hm. Hey, if you can fake sincerity, you've already got it made. So... what do you do for a living? I'm actually a fiscal lawyer but mostly deal with regional corporations that deal with advertising, marketing and. O my God! Please! Don't be so blah, say something real. It doesn't have to be beautiful as long as it's true. Stop being so dull. You're trouble. I've been told that before. Were you born like this? Am I not your type? Somewhat. I try to stay away from assholes like you. Well, sorry I can't be anybody else. You should know though, that I am very passionate about my job and the impact it has on thousands of people. You know that they are working towards their goals every day. Trying to make this world a better place. Trying to use their skills for good. So, does the father of your child care? I'm a polyamorous demi bisexual monogamist but I can make exceptions. Really? To which part? All of it. You never told me your name. Mrs. Smith I can drive you home? [Spanish radio] Sorry! No, I apologize. There are no returns. What about this address? No, no, no. This was the address I used to send him... the money for his book sales. Is it a publishing house? No, no. He always self-published. Sweet Daniel Day Lewis's foot. Ok. Thanks! I see. It works well. Almost new. 100 bucks. Could it be 150? Maybe? That’s the most I can give you. 125? 100, just that. Ok... 100 it is then. My fearless hitchhiking warrior. I got an address! What? No ones ever going to love you more than I do, Margot! I love that song! What? Nothing! Let's get the hell outta here! I found La Bestia! What? I can fix this! I found La Bestia. I heard you! What? What did you find? For me? Where did you find this? Don't worry about that, just look at the last page. An address? Not just any address. His. We're traveling half away across the country for an address? How do you even know it's his? Well I don't know it's his, but I'm guessing it must lead to his reducto. Well, I guess it's something. Is that a hickey? Sorry. Don't be sorry. That's my line, by the way. I was thinking... about a fresh start, a new beginning. Something fresh and exciting. I've had my share of false start, thank you very much. A nice ending would be more than enough. Okay, I'll start. Hi. Hi. Morning. This is already the worst second first date I've ever been on. Do you love me? I'm not in love with you. You're not in love with me, but do you love me still? I can tell you that I think we're great together. What is it you don't know? I don't know how I feel? Well if you don't know how you feel then how is it that you know if you love me or not? I don't know, it isn't rational. Margot, I'm trying to understand you, why do you keep shutting me down? It's just too much okay? It doesn't make any sense. - Yeah, but why? - Oh my god! You sound like one of those goddamned producers and critics! Why, why, why? I'm not a character Martin I don't learn from my mistakes my reactions have no motivations My life doesn't have goddamn story art. Stop the bus! Please? I'm a human being, okay? I fuck up. People act erratically, they say one thing and do something completely different. And the audience never learns why! Because life isn't a fucking movie! And I'm always stuck with me. Stuck somewhere with you. Fighting for myself and the world? Against the world and myself? And I don't know how in the hell we amounted to such tremendous fuckups! And you know what's really fucking frustrating? The fact that I'm the only one who ever options scripts and gets rejected. Because you are incapable of selling a freaking script by yourself. Why is that? Don't look across the tracks! There's nothing else out there. Don't you get it? It's just me and you... stranded in some Guatemalan abandoned railway station. There's no one else around you. - We can fix this. - No. We can't. We've wasted our lives and we've agreed to waste another. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. Look, we can fix this. We have this higher mission. You're delusional. Well, so be it! I mean, we've already made something beautiful together. - Just don't hold back. - I'm not holding back. - Don't hold back. - I'm not holding back! - Margot, just don't hold back. - Martin, leave me alone! You're already alone, Margot. You always have been. Not enough, apparently. Look, I know I may not have what it takes to be a proper father. I may not even have what it takes to be a proper screenwriter. But just trust me on this. There's got to be someone out there that knows what to do in these situations. And we're going to find them! Just, just don't hold back. Martin, for the last time... I am not holding back! [Sniffles] Nothing's gonna hurt you baby. As long as you're with me everything is going to be fine. You've always had a knack for appropriating the most appropriate song lyrics. Well, you're my forever girl. You stole that from Avatar. It's called an homage. Hello? Good morning? Anyone home? Say it. I don't have anything to say. Okay, maybe I do. Does it have anything to do with the alien life form inside of me? Maybe. This'll be good. I just want you to know, I'll always support your decision. Unlike before. And, I was thinking... I want you to go in and see them... without me. What about us? You know I'd follow you to the ends of the earth. First, you gotta know where you're going. We've made it this far together, I'm not going in without you. I'd probably just be star struc. I'd hate for them to see me like that. He's probably dead. Or the address is fake, or a decoy. Or an ambush. So pretty when you're sad. I'm always sad. You're always pretty [Upbeat music] I just got here and I already miss this place. Go, now. Yes? Sir, Mr. Poet, it's such an honor. That doesn’t belong to me. Are you not La Bestia? The Beast? You are looking for ghosts. Sit down. Do you know where he's buried? He can be anywhere. I need to find something he left behind. You remind of the Beast when he was your age, you know? Do you think that he fought to the very end? I’d like to think he did. I believe he did. - Do you know if there is anyone... - Look, I am just a forest ranger in this jungle. I don’t have any answers. So, what do you do for a living? I write. A writer? Are there still writers in the world? I thought all of them had been killed. We almost did. It's ok. What if we have to take life in order to protect life? In that case don’t be afraid. But I'm not afraid. This is all that is left of him. Take it. Thanks. Margot. Yes? There is nothing wrong with being a nobody once in a while. Did you find him? I don't know. Well, that's okay, There's still places we haven't been. Maybe we missed something at the lake? Or an old friend or lover back in the city. You never go back to where you came. You always go forward. I agree. Alone. Yeah, I know. Maybe we should split ways. Cover more territory? Right? Of course.
