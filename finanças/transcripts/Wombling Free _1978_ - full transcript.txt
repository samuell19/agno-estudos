[dramatic music] - [Bulgaria] When the world first was even from the days of Eve and Adam there were the wombles. And that was the start of it, human beings untidy from day one leaving the Wombles to clean up after them and it has continued thus right up to [parade music] [calm music] Never was there so much cleaning up to be done for so many by so few. And so we come to England, and to the Common, Wimbledon Common. [calm music] Now that is the Wimbledon Womble Burrow, their home. And not just a home but a positive hive of activity as you shall presently see. [calm music] Nice and warm and comfortable in here isn't it? Let me show you around. That's the workshop where the wombles make good use of bad rubbish. And here's Tobermory. He's in charge of the workshop. He's always busy inventing things. - Problems problems problems. - [Bulgaria] He is a born worrier. Perhaps we better leave him to it. To the dormitory. They're not in there now because wombles always get up very early to start work. And now their study. Oh just a minute what's that delicious smell? The kitchen. Madame Cholet who is the most famous womble cook in the whole world. [speaking in foreign language] - Madame Cholet is breakfast ready yet? - No it is not. - Oh. - Oh dear. - [Bulgaria] That was Tomsk that was. Now that's Bungo he's the youngest. Silly sort name that, Bungo. [sneezes] Orinoco tends to be fat greedy and lazy but he's very good at testing blackened jam. - I think I'd better taste test all the jam. - No no no no no no. - [Bulgaria] And last the young Wellington who wants to be an inventor like Tobermory. At the moment he's trying to invent a food mixer. He's quite clever really but lacks confidence. - There there Wellington off you go. [speaking in foreign language] - [Wellington] We have lift off, food mixer in orbit. - Mind you his inventions don't always work. Now you've met all the Wimbledon Wombles except me. Let me introduce myself, I am Bulgaria Coburg Womble better known as Great Uncle Bulgaria. Now then shall we get on with it? Here we see some of the human beings at Wimbledon Common. Let's see what you make of them. Mr. Arnold Takahashi, a Japanese car representative and his wife Doris. And a typically English businessman Mr. Roland Frogmorton with his wife Julia, and their daughter Felicity. [calm music] Mr. Frogmorton has one ambition in life to own that house next door. He's something in the city, I'm not sure what. He hasn't a car. He doesn't drive, he's too nervous, the war you know. He used to get dizzy spells at his desk in the pay core. [calm music] Now I'll show you where we the Wombles find ourselves today. Follow me. ♪ Standing on your tiptoes running on the spot ♪ ♪ Exercise is good for you laziness is not ♪ ♪ Running in the morning good for the thighs ♪ ♪ Running in the evening good for the eyes ♪ ♪ Physical exertion makes you strong ♪ ♪ Keeps you alert and slim ♪ Just keep skipping and you can't go wrong ♪ ♪ You'll be sound in mind and limb ♪ [upbeat music] ♪ Poetry in motion legs in line ♪ ♪ Stepping and stepping down four four time ♪ ♪ Standing on your tiptoes running on the spot ♪ ♪ Exercise is good for you laziness is not ♪ ♪ Standing on your tiptoes running on the spot ♪ ♪ Exercise is good for you laziness is not ♪ ♪ Standing on your tiptoes running on the spot ♪ ♪ Exercise is good for you laziness is not ♪ - Very good, very good. Now to work to work, tidy bags to the ready. Now look at this lot. this was all perfectly clean and tidy last night. Forward, number one working party. Wellington, Orinoco, Grissom come on. And you know it's not just a question of rubbish I mean. [engine roaring] Look at that wretched thing. It feels our ears with noise and our noses with a disgusting and dangerous smell. It's always, always, always. If only human beings would learn to use the stuff. [gulls cawing] If only they would listen to us. I sometimes think that if it wasn't for us Wombles they'd be over their ears in rubbish by now. In fact they probably soon will be. And not just on Wimbledon Common but over the whole world. Is it suppertime Madame Cholet? - [Madame Cholet] In a minute Great Uncle. Just go and wash your paws. - Is it suppertime yet Mummy? - In a minute Kim, please come in and wash your hands. [calm music] Darling bad day or good day? - Disastrous. [speaking in foreign language] - Very profitable day Doris, very profitable indeed my darling. - Blasted show off. - Tell you what I think Great Uncle Bulgaria is quite right, human beings ought to listen to us. After all as he says we're only trying to keep the world to clean, tidy, and beautiful place for us all to live in them as well as us. - Bungo we've tried to make them understand. We've tried loads of times. Great Uncle Bulgaria has been trying to tell them for hundreds of years. I'm sorry but he has. - Well I haven't. ♪ Running on your tiptoes running on the spot ♪ ♪ Exercise is good for you laziness is not ♪ - That's because you've only been a working womble for a couple of weeks young Bungo, night. - I don't care. I bet I can get a human being to listen to me. I bet I can get one to stop being untidy. I bet I can. - Lights out. And keep quiet young Bungo. [trumpet music] - Tell you what, I bet I can. [trumpet music] I still bet I can. [church bell ringing] [dramatic music] [upbeat music] Morning postman, morning. Morning Madame, morning horse. Oh I'm fed up. Oh well. How do you do sir? Hey dog. Tell you what, that's a deaf dog. Great Uncle Bulgaria's Morning Times, good. - [Julia] Have a good day darling. [calm music] - Oi. Pick that up. - What? - She's seen me. I said pick it up. - You should say pick it up please. - Sorry. - That's alright. - Pick that up please. - Who are you? - I'm Bungo Womble, who are you? - Felicity Kim Frogmorton. - You're all of them? - Yes, mostly Kim though. - Oh good. - Got to go now, school, bye. - [Bungo] Hey tell you what. Great Uncle Bulgaria says you've got to listen. - Okay, bye. - Okay, okay, hey she said okay, she said okay. I've made contact, I've made contact. - To you. - To me. - To you. - Sorry to me. - Hey hey I'll tell you what. I've made contact. I talked to a human being, I've made contact. I must tell Great Uncle Bulgaria. - You can tell Great Uncle Bulgaria when you help shift this sofa. - Well I did I honestly did. - So yearling you've been able to do what Bulgaria's been unable to do all his years. - Yes I did. - Very good but you can still help shift this sofa. - [Madame Cholet] Taste it, just taste it. - Certainly Madame Cholet I shall taste it. - It is horrible. Not any corn and the soup is horrible. And why you ask myself? Because the stupid human beings are using all the spray weed, weed sprays what you call them. All our food from the Common is being ruined. We shall all become thin. And whoever heard of a thin womble? - Well I can't say that-- [speaking in foreign language] There there Madame Cholet don't take on so. [all talking at once] We must pin our faith on Tobermory. I have reason to believe that his new recycling machine may take the poison out of our food. - I hope so but he had better be very quick about it. - Uncle Bulgaria. - We'll all get [speaking in foreign language] Mark my words. - I got her to listen, I got her to listen. I got her to listen. - Take your time young Bungo take your time. Now what is it? - I got her to listen, I got her to listen. - You got who to listen? - A human being, Felicity Kim Frogmorton. I got her to listen, I got her to listen. - Will you stop circulating? What did you tell her to listen to? - I forgot. - There's not much point in telling human beings to listen if you don't tell her what to listen to. But it's a step forward young Bungo. Indeed it's more than I've ever been able to do especially with the Frogmortons. I've seen Mr. Frogmorton many times. Close too but he chooses not to see me. Well done, well done. We must try again. It's the personal touch that counts, the personal touch. The personal touch. The personal column. Once more into the Times young wombles, once more. I'm sorry did that hurt? [upbeat music] - Yes sir we understand you're entering the personal column. - Any messages for Finch? - Good morning. [upbeat music] - [Radio] With bright periods and scattered showers it is exactly half past eight. [orchestral music] - Roland, the Keep Britain Tidy Group are having their annual general meeting at the Albert Hall next week. Silly Billy that I am completely slipped the old noggin. Memo, as Wimbledon Branch Secretary must remember to go. - Yes dear must go. - Roland, Delphine's getting married again. Third time. Memo, must remember not to go to that. - Not to go yes dear, no dear. - Roland dear personal column Times. Will Mr. Frogmorton, Wimbledon kindly contact Bulgaria Coburg Womble urgently. Box 123, W-O-M. - Who? - Bulgaria Coburg Womble dear. - I know Bungo. - Bungo who dear? - Bungo Womble, I met him on the Common. He's about four feet tall and he's fat and furry. - Another one of your imaginary friends dear? Like Jimmy Wonky? - Oh no Mommy not like Jimmy Wonky. I really saw him. He said something about listening to his uncle. - There you see you've upset your father again. You and your invisible friends. I do wish you'd stop talking about them. He'll be nervous for the rest of the day now. [orchestral music] - Daddy this was a real one. - Kim I have a long day ahead of me. One that I can well do without and already it is starting in complete and utter confusion. Your mother is right you have upset me. I am sick to death of these imaginary friends of yours. And as for spending the hard earned pocket money I give you inserting silly incomprehensible messages to me, to me your own father in of all things that Times newspaper. Anyway the Times is supposed to be taken seriously. It is not there for our entertainment. - But Daddy, it's his uncle. He said we've got to listen. - And I suppose he's four feet, fat, and furry as well. - Possibly Daddy. - What in the name of Mary Poppins is the world coming to? Four feet, fat, and furry uncles. And there'll be no pocket money for at least a fortnight. You know I'm saving up for the house next door Kim. - Blessed fathers. - [Bulgaria] Now this piece of precision engineering is the brainchild of Tobermory. The rubbish being fed into it will eventually solve the world's food problems. When that green mixture is applied vegetables and edible plants will, he hopes, bloom and grow beyond belief, bloom and grow I say. - Alright now Tomsk stand by. Put more tins down the shoot. - Right there are more tins down the shoot. Over and out. - Roger. - What's it going to do Tobermory? - I told you Orinoco, it's a surprise. And I'll give you a clue, it's to do with food. - Oh food? - Yes food. In fact I hold the view we'd better get this mixture right or we might all starve. Stand by, that bat and ball pump, get that in there. [upbeat music] Done it. [upbeat music] Everyone in? - [All] Yes. - Now watch that tube change color. What did I tell you? - I tell you what. - What? - Is that all? - Wait and see young Womble, wait and see. - Hello. - Hello okay listen. - Can't stop, late for school. Come to tea on Saturday. - Oh lovely. - Number four, that's our flat. - Thanks. - Who was that? - Felicity Kim Frogmorton my friend. - Can I come too? I like tea. - Sorry she only asked me. [laughing] - Well now friendliness gone out the window along with courtesy. [calm music] [dramatic music] Well I'm worn out, I'm worn out I tell you. I've got to have 40 winks to get my strength up. [dramatic music] - Why are they stopping? Who's this lot then? Why do they got them funny hats on? - Right we're here. - Yes we're here, Wimbledon Common. - I now that Earnest. The proposed freeway, four lanes Earnest will commence at the junction from the main road to the west there. It will bestride the Common from there to there. - Yeah but that means the demolition of the windmill there and the Regency one over there, and the Victorian one there. - Course it does. - What about the people? - What about the people, what's it gotta do with them? Concrete pylons Earnest, concrete pylons will support the construction there, there, and there. - Now that's a nice little house that is. - It won't be. Right then Earnest I shall leave it up to you to lay on the high max, concrete mixers, all necessary materials, and working force. 28th at 0800 sharp is DD, that is demolition day. Flatten it Earnest make a good job of it, flatten it. - What all of it? - All of it. - If you ask me it's sending good money after bad to put another advert in the Times. - It's our only hope old friend. We must get them to listen to us. Things are going from bad to worse. [knocking on door] - Enter. - All concrete mixers. - All mixers, heavy materials. - Materials. - And a pylon. - The pylon. - The demolition. - The demolition. - And high max. - Hi max. - There going to flatten us! - There going to flatten us! - So it comes to this. Not only are a number of human beings going to have their houses knocked down but the windmill too will be demolished. Worst of all our burrow will be flattened out of existence. I've often feared such a catastrophe might strike therefore I have made contingency plans should we be forced to leave our Wimbledon home and set up a burrow elsewhere. The happy and glorious garden. I'm sure Her Majesty wouldn't mind. - [Madame Cholet] Leave never! [formal music] - [Bulgaria] Bungo and Tomsk you will disguise yourselves as guard soldier human beings. You will find a sensor box. Tomsk will stand guard. Bungo you will dig a tunnel under the wall and into the Queen's garden which we'll explore to see if it will make a pleasant home for us. - Good evening officer. [dogs barking] - Now I know what a mole feels like. [dogs barking] Wolves, wild vicious animals, wolves. Help Tomsk help. Wolves. - What? - Run for it it's wolves. - Wolves? - Yes wolves making wild vicious attack. Run for it. [babbling] [crunching] - Wolves, fancy her having wolves. Perhaps they were a present from loyal subjects in Canada. People do give her the most extraordinary presents I hear. Nevertheless that's the end of that, a pity. We'd better start packing I suppose. [rumbling] What's that, what's that noise? [rumbling] Its the roof, it's caving in, the roof is caving. [all talking at once] [dramatic music] - It's the demolition guys. They really are gonna flatten us. [all talking at once] [dramatic music] [horn honking] - Stop it, stop it! - What? - Stop it! - Alright stop it, stop it. - Wrong Common! Not Wimbledon Common, Wondsworth isn't it? Wondsworth Common! - Not Wimbledon, Wondsworth isn't it? Wrap it, wrap it up, wrap it. [all talking at once] - Oh well, win a Common lose a Common. All part of life's rich pageant. - [Bungo] They made a mistake. - [Tomsk] Yeah they made a mistake. [all talking at once] - [Bulgaria] By hat we'd better warn the Wondsworth Wombles.

He says that the Womgro that I gave Bungo will make human beings listen to us at last. - Well he hasn't gone yet has he? - Who? - Bungo. - Yes why? - Well you didn't put the top on. - Does that matter? - Of course it matters the air is full of pollution. And that muck gets sucked into the jar anything could happen. - Anything? - Anything and I do mean anything. [calm music] [dramatic music] [calm music] - Hello. [dramatic music] - [Tobermory] Anything could happen, anything. And I do mean anything. [upbeat music] [dramatic music] - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello I brought you a present. - What? [somber music] - Gee thanks. - The more we can get for the Keep Britain Tidy meeting the better. People are so apathetic. They just don't care about the beauties of nature anymore. [speaking in foreign language] I mean nature is so important. I often ask myself where would we be without nature? [speaking in foreign language] I expect you have exactly the same problems in Japan. - Mommy. - Yes dear? - Can I have a friend to tea? - Oh what friend dear? Not Jimmy Wonky I trust. We've had such trouble with Jimmy Wonky. You see he's invisible, Kim made him up. And really all last year she wouldn't go anywhere unless he came too. You have no idea how difficult it is to take an invisible friend on holiday. The waiters in Spanish hotel that we were quite mad or something. - No Mummy not Jimmy Wonky it's a new friend. He's called Bungo Womble. I did tell you about him remember? The morning Daddy went spare again. You never listen. - Bungo Womble how quaint. - Yes Mummy but can he stay to tea? - Yes I suppose so dear. - Thanks. Will you come and meat him? - Yes in a minute dear. - Thank you. - It's so essential not to suppress a child's imagination don't you think? Roland just doesn't understand that. [speaking in foreign language] Mind you it's difficult enough bringing up a daughter that you can see let alone having to put up with friends of hers that you can't. [speaking in foreign language] Kim? Where are you? - [Kim] In here Mommy. [calm music] - Hello Mrs. Frogmorton. - [Julia] Hello. - It's very nice to see you. - It's very nice to be able to see you. [calm music] - [Kim] It was nice of you to come over Bungo. - Not at all, thank you for asking me. - Oh and tell your Great Uncle Bulgaria that I meant what I said just now. - What? - That whenever he has his birthday well give him a party here at the house. That goes for the rest of you of course. Can't be much fun having a party under the ground, especially for an old womble like him. - I don't think he'll come. Doesn't like going out much. - Well ask him all the same. - Alright bye. - [Kim] How old is he anyway? - About 300. - Oh yes very funny. - [Arnold] Thanks for the game Mr. Roland. And cheer up old boy you can't win all time. - Well you certainly seem to. As I would say the best man won. - You said it, you said it not me. You said it. - Nasty little show off, oh I do hate him. He's such a show off. Show off! Good evening. - Good evening sir. - Thank you. - Bye. - And all you ended up with was a piece of string? And what do you mean you didn't tell her? - Yes I forgot. I'm very very sorry. - You just told her to listen. - Oh I forgot that too, it was such a super tea. Oh yes but I did tell her it was your birthday. But I forgot when it was. They've invited you to have a party at their house. - I don't have a birthday anymore not since 1900. When you get to my age you don't need a birthday. And I'm highly displeased with you young Bungo. We lost a valuable opportunity with little hope that another one turns up. [calm music] [bagpipe music] [calm music] [horn honking] - Excuse me sir. Have you finished with your copy of the Times? The Times sir, may I borrow it? Thank you. - Oh good evening sir. Thank you very much sir. What's this place then? - [Bulgaria] It's a picture house, or rather it was. Human beings used to come to places like this every night. - [Orinoco] What for? - To see pictures, moving pictures like we see on the television box thing in the burrow only bigger. They've got roles of paper with little photographs on them and they push light through them onto that silver sheet up there. Places like this were magic palaces. Like a sort of dream world. Most human beings being the lazy creatures they are stay at home now and watch bioscope picture projections. Oh my goodness it could do with a clean up. Sad to see it like this. I'll tell you what. Let's do a bit of tidying up before we go home. Give the place back a little self respect. - Must've been smashing especially those with music. - I like those with music.

Here comes MacWomble the Terrible calling the news. [all talking at once] [bagpipe music] - My dear MacWomble the Terrible. Welcome this is a surprise. What brings you to Wimbledon? - Going to present my new car at the Motor Show my dear Great Uncle Bulgaria. I thought I'd just drop in pay you a visit. - [Bulgaria] How very thoughtful. It's good to see you. What a splendid car it is, a marvelous machine. [horn honks] How does it work? - Clockwork my dear Bulgaria. Plain ordinary clockwork, thus avoiding the use of oil or petrol. - Can we have a go please? - Certainly give it a wind up. Now get in. Good, now just pull the lever and steer. Yeah that's the way. Now you're driving. [bagpipe music] The human beings will be plain daft if they don't see its immediate potential possibilities. [bagpipe music] - Yes well I mean I personally deploy petrol fumes. no my dear friend they must appreciate your genius. [bagpipe music] It would solve the whole human oil problem. I believe they're desperate for new sources of power and you have it, clockwork. Clockwork. This Japanese chap I'm telling you about has got something to do with cars. He's new to the area. They're very astute as a race the Japanese. Their little fingers I believe thus enabling them to carry out delicate machine work. Now there's his house. We'll leave the car outside and with luck he will appreciate not only its possibilities but will also recognize our existence. [bagpipe music] Good luck, here it is good luck car, good luck. Let's sit here shall we? - We'll do that. - Now that's the nincompoop who won't answer my entry in the Times personal column. - He looks the sort who wouldn't answer your entry in the Times personal column. Right special he looks. - Hello darling bad day or-- - Equally disastrous. - Sherry for my cherri. [dramatic music] - Now that's the Jap chap. [speaking in foreign language] - Oh boy Doris. [contemplative music] What the Fujiyama is this? [speaking in foreign language] Oh no my darling scent off cauliflower. No shout at you in public. Merely surprised at seeing such fantastic vehicle. Wonder if it work. Oh boy, clockwork. - He's got it. - Well done Bulgaria it's going to work. - Hey potential possibilities, fantastic. Solve world fuel shortage and no erosion problem. Not let whole world see. [speaking in foreign language] Open garage doors my darling pea pod. [bagpipe music] Blimey. By Saint George and Tokyo really it work. A little slow but it work. Shut garage door quick baby doll. Never see anything like it in life. [speaking in foreign language] No potential really. Me just being too greedy too quickly. It's someone's good idea though. Maybe for kids. Can't see whole world going exactly bananas about a car who only do two or three mile an hour for clock tick. [speaking in foreign language] Yeah yeah so no... Hey good looking, got another great idea. How about petrol? - Petrol no that's not the idea. - Car have charm that for sure. A little small but but nonetheless have charm. Sort of like hot saki. How about cars made from all bed stand? [speaking in foreign language] Hey how about it indeed Doris? But before buying up all vintage car all over place I give them car made from bed stand and rubbish, and any old iron car. [speaking in foreign language] My Lord indeed my darling. Just a question of putting in a new engine. [speaking in foreign language] Great old lawnmower engine. We make a million, well done Doris. [speaking in foreign language] At least. - Too late I fear my friend. No same old problem human greed. - Rolls Royce eat your heart out. [speaking in foreign language] Not about pollution damn it. Who care about pollution? We gonna make fortune. [speaking in foreign language] [dramatic music] [horn honks] [engine rumbling] [erratic music] Stupid idea in first place. You idiot Doris. [speaking in foreign language] - [MacWomble] Bulgaria don't you ever suggest such a course of action to me again will you? - [Bulgaria] Well no I mean I thought it was going to work. I'm awfully sorry I really really am. - It's all very well be sorry. But in Heaven do I get back home? - Leave it to me Bulgaria I'll get him home. I'll get him home in style. - But how Tobermory how? I feel terrible about it. It was my idea. Now he's missed the car show and he's furious. He says we're not to speak to him. - Bulgaria I shall require all the assistance available. Now ask the others to get in double feature. Not only will we get him, but we'll give him a present as well. I am going to invent something. It'll be called WOLA Scotland. - WOLA Scotland, what's WOLA? - I'll give you a clue. - You'll have to tidy this lot up you know. - Tidy it up, I'm going to use it all. Well there's lots more of course. But do you remember what it was? Something I can never get solved. Never had the right engine remember? - Well for the life of me no. - Good, then it'll be a surprise for you as well then won't it? - Ah there you are my dear MacWomble. Here's a drop of your favorite Scotch broth and a nipple how's that? Oh I said I'm sorry, sorry about the car show. But I intend to make it up to you. - Don't try and butter me up Bulgaria. Don't talk to me in fact. And what is that terrible noise? - [Bulgaria] It's a surprise. - I said don't talk to me. - You asked me a question. - And I got no answer. - You told me not to talk to you. Anyway I can't stop, lots to do. Be ready to get up early. You got an early start. - An early start to where? - Scotland of course, where else? - Well I'm not walking that's for sure. [loud banging] [eerie music] Suffering lumpy porridge. In the name of Loch Ness what's going on in there? What are you doing with my bagpipe womble toy. - Just tasty MacWomble just testing. - Just testing what Bungo just testing what? - We've been told you don't want us to talk to you so I won't. - I do now. In the name of Brigadoon what are you testing? - You'll see in the morning. [babbling] Sorry about that. - Serves you right if it hurts. You'd better know what you're doing Bulgaria. - You want to go home don't you? - You care not, fine I do. - Well then just be a good MacWomble the Terrible. It's two minutes to takeoff. - Two minutes to what? - Look. [bagpipe music] - I think I got it right MacWomble. I always had the balloons but no engine. It's yours as a present from all of us. - Please accept it as recompense for ruining your visit. You know the car show and all that. You can start your own pollution free airline now. Your clockwork invention can be used after all. Look WOLA, Wombling Over Land Airways, Scotland. - Scotland? Oh I can see the potential Bulgaria. A fuel-less, noiseless air machine. [jet engine roaring] Noisy wasteful thing making dirty marks all over the sky. We'll show them, lead me to it. It's a good job I did a bit of pirating in the Royal Womble Flying Core aye? I think I've still got the hang of it. [speaking in foreign language] Stand by prop one. - Prop one. - Prop two. - Prop two. - Set course. - Set course. - Let go anchor. - Anchor away. - We have liftoff. - He has liftoff. - He has liftoff. - Yes he has liftoff, he has. [dramatic music] - Farewell my bonnies. [calm music] [speaking in foreign language] - Sure, honorable wife say then car fall apart. Then car fall apart. How I didn't blow it for good she'll never know. - Extraordinary. [speaking in foreign language] - So honorable wife say next morning whole heap of junk have gone like it was cleared by magic. She say like we have fairies at the bottom of our Common. - A womble? - Julia. - Well it could be. - Julia please. - What are wombles Mrs. Frogmorton? - Never mind Mr. Arnold Takahashi - Never mind what old chap? - Never mind what wombles are. Don't go on about them is all. - I am not going on about it. Now why the hell you talking like that all of a sudden? You got trouble with new teeth old chap? - Certainly not my teeth are almost all my own almost all. I'm having trouble with my wombles. No I mean her wombles. No I mean my child's wombles. - Really? - He doesn't like me to talk about them. - I can see that. [speaking in foreign language] That's what I'm trying to ascertain Doris, what she's chomping on about. - I demand to be heard in my own house. He never listens. [babbling] Unimaginative lump that he is. Just because he's never seen one he can't bear to think that others have. - What the poopa-cotta-pedal are they Mrs. Frogmorton? - Oh my dear thank you for asking. I've been so afraid to say. He's such a putter downer he's never asked. He just gets up and slams out of the house. - For the last time Mrs. Frogmorton what are they? - Don't tell him Julia. - I defy you, I shall speak. [speaking in foreign language] - Shut up Doris the woman trying to tell us something. Go on Mrs. Frogmorton. - I met one. His name's Bungo. He's four foot tall, fat, and furry and he wears a little hat. And he was very polite and he came to tea. Kim brought him. And he came to tea. He's got an uncle, or rather a great uncle. That's it he's got a great uncle. [speaking in foreign language] Oh my dear you don't understand. Don't you have them in Japan, wombles? Short, fat, and furry? Short, fat, and furry? They tell us to listen. - What for? In name of Emperor what for? - That's just it. I don't know. All I see is I've made a fool of myself as usual. Put it down to the port I suppose. But they do exist, they really do. [door creaking] - I say hold it down folks. Got a hard day ahead. Got get my sleep you know. Incidentally Mommy when's Great Uncle Bulgaria's birthday? When's Great Uncle Bulgaria's birthday? - I don't know my darling child. Ask Bungo when you see him. - Okay, night all. [speaking in foreign language] - Okay sweetmeat now finding oneself in eye of western hurricane like one hell of row you know. Opportunity of tearing honorable life sick to death to point of taking up kamikaze piloting in weekends seriously that you also unimaginative lump. Why you not take trouble to learn blessed English all these years same like what I have? Translating is positive bore. All time losing train of thought in order to translate. [calm music] Oy vey. - Oy vey? I mean you've got to push a Japanese fellow pretty far for him to come out with the Hebrew. Good Lord Julia I don't mind you telling me about Wombles privately but in public? And to a business associate? You know how important it is for a man's wife to give at any rate the appearance of being reasonably stable. Even if in fact she's falling apart at the seams. As you seem to be doing. I do think you ought to see Doctor Walsh. I'm trying to understand Julia dear really I am. I can put up with Kim and her invisible friends but not you dear, not you seeing them too. You don't have to see them do you? Good heavens it's not compulsory is it? And as for your talking about Great Uncle Bulgaria's birthday well I really really do worry for you. [calm music] - Goodnight Roland. I'm sorry I spoiled your evening. - That's alright Julia. Goodnight. Incidentally. - Yes? When is Great Uncle Bulgaria's birthday? - What? - What? - Goal, we are the champions. We are the champions. Oh Mommy you're just not trying today. - I just not up to much today Kim old mate. I'm on the fragile side. You know what with last night and Daddy getting in to such a state. His mother told me once, Grandma you know, he was always highly strung as a boy. Used to bite his nails a lot and other nasty habits. - Such as? - She's never told me the details dear - Daddy's so complicated, that's his trouble. If only he'd uncomplicate he'd be alright. Suppose you can't really expect a man like him to believe in our wombles can you? He's so blessed practical. - Sometimes you're a very wise little tich Kim. I suppose it comes down to if you want to see good in the world you will. And if you don't you won't. - Blimey that's pretty wise too Mum. - Don't say blimey dear it's awfully unattractive. - Oi, is this your ball? - Bungo old thing. - Hello. - Thanks how you doing? Look a bit miffed, quite down in the dumps man. What's up? - Yes what's up? We down in the dumps folks have got to stick together. - You too Mrs. Frogmorton? - Yes me too. Matter of fact had a bit of an up and downer about you and your friends last night. No one believes we've met, silly isn't? - Course it's silly. Tell you what I just remembered. Great Uncle Bulgaria got me in the dumps. Hey that's a good word that, dumps. He was cross 'cause I didn't tell you what it was you were to listen to. I didn't give you the message and what else was it? - Oh don't forget now what on Earth is it? - No I've remembered what the message is but there was something else I forgot. - Well let's go through it step by step. What's the message? - Well it's to do with keeping Wimbledon Common this Common clean and to get in touch with you human beings so that all the world can be kept clean and tidy and to make good use of bad rubbish to stop mankind and womblekind from disappearing in it up to their ears. Be quicker for us 'cause we're smaller. - So that's it. Oh my dear dear Bungo I believe in that too. Lots of human beings do. - Honest? - Of course honest. I'm Branch Secretary of the Keep Britain Tidy Group. There's hundreds of us. Tell your charming Great Uncle that you've been in touch with us you've made contact. We must all meet, you and all the wombles. Come to our house. - Contact? - Yes. [laughing] - You mean it? Do you really mean it? We're saved. He will be pleased. - Bungo wait. Talk about forgetting. - What? - We forgot to ask you when is his birthday? - Who's birthday? - Great Uncle Bulgaria's. - Oh yes, tell you what that's it. That's the other thing I forgot. - Well when is it? - [Bungo] He doesn't have one. - Don't be a twit, everyone has a birthday. - Oh no not him, not since 1900 he said whatever that was. No he doesn't have one. He doesn't know what day it is anyway. - When shall we have it then? - Any day you like. - What about next Friday? A meeting and a party. - Alright see you. - And for Heaven's sake don't forget. - What? - Oh Bungo, bring him. - And the others? - Of course, our place Friday. - Forgot to ask, what time? - Oh Bungo. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday Uncle Bulgaria ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you - Oh Kim I dow wish Daddy could see this. It would do him the world of good. I'm really worried about him darling. - Well he's not the man he was, that's for sure. [calm music] - [All] Speech, speech, speech. - My dear friends I won't make a long speech. I'm getting on a bit. But what a day for us all. Not only a surprise birthday but long last the human beings, these charming human beings are recognizing our existence. [all cheering at once] [calm music] - Just the rest of pulling myself together. I must not crack. There are no such things as wombles. What were those things I saw? No no I didn't see them, steady Roland. You did not see them. I'd did not see them. - Not me mate I didn't see them either. - I remain yours very sincerely, Bulgaria Coburg Womble. [all cheering at once] - So beastly for Julia to go there, really beastly. But I'm overworked. Yes sir that's it, I'm overworked. - Oh thought so. [horn honks] [all cheering at once] - Yet they speak and I hear them. No I don't, I don't. Roland you're a nincompoop. You don't hear them. [voices chattering in the distance] One day I shall buy you I swear it. [all talking at once] Julia. Hello. Home. [balloon pops] Guests? Sounds like a party. That's nice. That's very nice. I don't remember Julia saying anything about [overlapping voices] Party? - Yes darling a party. And this is Great Uncle Bulgaria. It's his party remember? Say you see him Roland. Say you see the others too my poor addle headed darling. Well? - Say you do Daddy, try hard. - I do, I do. I really do. [all talking at once] You really are real aren't you? Yes you really are here.

So let us brace ourselves to the task. Behind me in these two dust carts you see an example of the rubbish collected in just one week from the inhabitants of Wimbledon Common, one week only. Ones mind boggles when one considers the amount of call it what you will that is discarded not only by us but by the world. The wombles my friends have taken on the arduous task of keeping not only this Isle, this sceptered Isle set in a silver sea, this England. Some of us know our Shakespeare. Yeah well the wombles have taken on the task not only of keeping England bright and beautiful but so to have their brothers and sisters in arms in each and every country throughout the world. [light hearted applauding] Join me my friends. They are so few we and are so many. Accept them, embrace them, and listen to their clarion call. There they are, that happy breed. Recognize them and I repeat join with me. My friends keep Britain tidy. [wombles cheering] - What's he on about? Ain't nothing I do recognize. - I heard that sir, you cynic. Don't you see that's just the point? They are there but you don't want to acknowledge them. You don't want to hear the message. [thunder rolling] - That's Daddy, he's gone too far. - Don't be silly dear. [thunder rolling] [speaking in foreign language] - Course he's not God Doris. [speaking in foreign language] Sure I'm sure, shut up Doris. [thunder rolling] [wind blowing] [speaking in foreign language] - [Woman] Get out of the rain. - Yes well now I think that'll do for today. [thunder rolling] [speaking in foreign language] [thunder rolling] [wind blowing] [rain falling] [birds singing] - [Kim] Bungo old thing, need any help? - Tell you what, yes please. ♪ Underground overground wombling free ♪ ♪ The Wombles of Wimbledon Common are we ♪ ♪ Making good use of the things that we find ♪ ♪ Things that the everyday folk leave behind ♪ ♪ Uncle Bulgaria he can remember the days ♪ ♪ When he wasn't behind the times ♪ ♪ With his map of the world ♪ Pick up the papers and take them to Tobermory ♪ ♪ Underground overground wombling free ♪ ♪ The Wombles of Wimbledon Common are we ♪ ♪ Making good use of the things that we find ♪ ♪ Things that the everyday folk leave behind ♪ ♪ We're so incredibly utterly devious ♪ ♪ Making the most of everything ♪ ♪ Even bottles and tins ♪ Pick up the pieces and make them into something new ♪ ♪ Is what we do ♪ Wombles are organized wombles a team ♪ ♪ Wombles are tidy and wombles are clean ♪ ♪ Underground overground wombling free ♪ ♪ The Wombles of Wimbledon Common are we ♪ [upbeat music] ♪ People don't notice us they never see ♪ ♪ Under their noses a womble may be ♪ ♪ Underground overground wombling free ♪ ♪ The Wombles of Wimbledon Common are we ♪ ♪ Uncle Bulgaria he can remember the days ♪ ♪ When he wasn't behind the times ♪ ♪ With his map of the world ♪ Pick up the papers and take them to Tobermory ♪ ♪ Underground overground ♪ Underground overground ♪ Underground overground [dramatic music]
