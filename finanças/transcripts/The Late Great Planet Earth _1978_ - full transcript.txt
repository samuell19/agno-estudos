Next stop will be Littleton. Excuse me. Do you know when the next stop is? It should be Jack's service station, about half an hour. I'm dying of thirst. It's hot. You from around here? Yeah. I'm going to Seattle. I'm just passing through. Going to see my boyfriend. Two more days. I can't wait. I thought you were from the city, 'cause, uh... You don't look like you're from around here. I've been gone for a long time. You have a boyfriend? No. Sounds like a yes to me. I'm Susan. I'm Josie. Shit! He left without me. Excuse me, sir, when's the next bus? Thursday.what?! You can catch the bus in town, and if you miss that, lambertsville is only a couple of hours on down the road. But how am I supposed to get there? Somebody's bound to pass here sooner or later. [ Water running ] Josie! Hi, mom. Thanks for meeting me at the bus stop. Oh, honey, you're early. The bus wasn't due for 40 minutes. Davy and me were gonna meet you. It's okay. Oh, mom, I've missed you! Josie! Davy! I hardly recognize you. I brought you a present.Really?! I hope you're still into plants. [ Machinery whirrs ] It's neat. Thought you'd like it. Oh, Josie, baby, we've missed you too. Will you, for god's sake, stop fidgeting? Ha! How's that? Give her time, Matt. She just got back today. Dad! Shh! Play! I've seen a lot of Matt lately. Actually, I told him to pitch a tent on the doorstep. He's practically been camping here since he heard you were coming home. He'll be thrilled to know you've actually made it. Are you gonna marry Matt now that you're back? Just shut up and play with your carnivorous plant. [ Telephone rings ] Hiya. Oh! Welcome back! I'll pass you to Matt. [ Distant horse whinnies ] Hi. Hey, fellow, what's your name? Well, his name is Chester, but I call him Wolfie, 'cause he's always chasing girls. [ Chuckles ] Don't worry. Somebody's bound to come along sooner or later. I just don't want to miss the bus in lambertsville. Well, just wait a few minutes, and if no one comes by, I'll call Bob, and either he or Matt can give you a ride on down the road. Thanks. Yep. You like him, hmm? He's a good dog. Old lover boy. See? Told you so. Come on, Chester. Come on. Can I help you, ma'am? [ Indistinct conversation ] Hi.hi. God. Last time I saw you, you were 16. Yeah. We were engaged. Yep. Well, welcome back. Thanks. Good to see you, Matt. You like living in the city? Yeah, I guess.Yeah? You staying here long? I don't know. Maybe. I like your new car. Yeah, thanks. It's a desoto. Wanna go for a ride? Maybe we could just go for a walk. Okay. Whatever. You look the same. You still got that tooth! [ Playfully ] Shut up! Christ! Half these trees are dried out. Tomorrow morning, we'll load up as many as we can. Yep. Bob: That rain should have pumped 'em full of life. They're dying off. Talk about your acid rain. Excuse me. Dr. Kruger, I need to speak to you-- in private, please. Why, certainly. I've taken the Liberty of conducting some research on some possible areas of radioactivity outside the perimeter of this plant. Dr. Taylor, I don't want there to be any confusion about the duties for which you were hired to work here at the plant. Please let me finish, Dr. Kruger. These results were alarming. They were shocking. I found very high levels of radioactivity. The strange thing is it didn't seem to have any connection at all with the power plant. I don't understand. Very good, Dr. Taylor. You did well by coming to me with this. Great. We wouldn't want to take any risks. Dr. Pritzi, I'd like you to personally look into this matter. Dr. Taylor will give you all the information he's collected, and I want you to get to the bottom of this problem immediately. I want answers by the end of the week. I suggest that we--thank you, Dr. Taylor. You may go now. From now on, Dr. Pritzi will be responsible for this matter. Ah, one more thing, Dr. Taylor. I would like to remind you that it is absolutely forbidden to even possess any alcoholic beverages on the premises of the plant. [ Stammering ] I-I don't-- I believe this is yours, Dr. Taylor. At least, it was found in your office. R-Really i-i-- this time I will look the other way, in the name of friendship, but I hope you realize this could cost you your position if somehow this slips out. [ Sighs ]You may go now. Thanks. Hey! I hope this one's going in the right direction. Excuse me, sir, could you give me a ride to lambertsville? [ Scottish accent ] Sure. I'll give you a ride to lambertsville. Hop in. Sure is hot, isn't it? Yeah. I'll bet you're hot as well. You like music? Yeah. I'll bet you like something else, don't you? Hey, get off, jerk! Well, I like that. Come on! I ain't gonna hurt you! Get off me!I'm gonna stick it to you! Get off me, you pig!I'm gonna stick it to you! Oh, jeez! Ohh! [ Susan shrieks ] Oh, jeez! You shouldn't have done that! Bitch! She shouldn't have done that! Hey! That's no fair! I was only kidding! You can come out now! Hey, come on out now! I'm gonna leave you here! Aw, to hell with you tramps, anyway. [ Truck door closes; Engine starts ] [ Susan screams ] No! [ Screams ] [ Geiger counter crackling ] [ Crackling continues ] And what kind is that? It's yellow oak, and I found it in the wasatch forest on October 5th. Are they always yellow? No, only in October. And then I found those in the wasatch forest. What are these? I couldn't find out what this is, but I just called it the "spear elm," 'cause that's what it looks like. I found that in the wasatch forest on August 6th. This is a maple. I found that in September. Mm-hmm. And I call this the banana leaf, and I found that in November. How 'bout another drink? Don't you think you've had enough? A man may drink too much, but there are circumstances in which you cannot get enough to drink. What do you say we go on over to my place for a night cap? Come on. I live just around the corner. Sheriff. Sheriff, let's you and me go someplace and talk. Uh-uh, cutie pie. You and me, we're going somewhere. 'Night, sheriff. The only customers Paula's been taking round back lately are the ones that have been too drunk to see what they're getting into. Have another drink and forget about it. Happens to lots of guys, even sober. I mean, what the hell-- it can't hurt. I got the feeling something awful's going to happen here, something terrible. Why? Because you can't get it up? Believe me, mister, it ain't that big of a deal. Twenty here... Twenty-five here... Thirty here. It's as though the source of radioactivity isn't coming from the power plant. It's in the forest around here. Doesn't make any sense. Just doesn't make any sense. Sometimes I don't understand you guys. Here you are talking nonsense on my bed, worrying about your job instead of-- instead of relaxing and enjoying yourselves. Nonsense to me. Yeah, maybe you're right. What does it matter to me? [ Barks ] Quiet, Chester. Stop barking. Something out there, fellow? Come on, Chester. There's nothing out there. Come back here and lay down. Chester! Chester, you hear me? Come back here. Come on. Lay down. There's nothing out there, boy. Hey, come on. Down. Lay down. Stay there.. Stay, you hear? [ Chester barking ] [ Barking ] [ Snarling ] Hey, Josie, remember this? We used to be closer. This is paradise. Yeah. [ Josie giggling ] [ Shrieking playfully ] Hey! [ Laughing ] Yeah! Hey! Whoo! Yeah! I like it here. It feels good! That was romantic, but, damn, it was cold. Matt? Matt, where are you? Matt? Matt? Matt? Josie: Matt! Shit. Can't remember my way out of here. [ Gasps ] I can't believe you're still into that shit. Still as bitchy as you were at 16, huh? Could you give me my shoe? [ Screams ] Oh, my god! I'll go out there with you kids, but I don't believe you. Frankly, Josie, I think you two kids went up into the woods and snorted something that you brought back from the big city. You got no call, sheriff. We saw that body. We could go to the state police. All right, all right. We'll fill out the report. You kids seem so anxious to do it. We already told you everything, sheriff. Why don't we just go there, okay? There's no hurry. If you really saw a corpse, it's not going anywhere. It won't run away. Now... What was the purpose of this trip to the woods? [ Water rushing nearby ] Here. It was right here. Maybe it was over here, Matt. No, it was here. Somebody moved it. Or, uh, maybe it moseyed down to the soda shop for a spot of coke, eh, kids? You kids! You get my goat! I remember you from high school-- both of you! Troublemakers. We're not in high school anymore, sheriff. Maybe you oughtta be. Ahh. Prick. Come on. When the sheriff called me saying somebody'd found that body near to the site, I thought it was safer to have it brought in here, and I was right? What do you mean? The corpse is highly contaminated. You mean she died because of radioactivity? No, Dr. Kruger. But what concerns me... She must have died for some other reason. But her body is soaked with radioactivity, as if she swam in-- in a pool of uranium. You know we're going to have to keep this quiet. I know. You can count on me, kruger, and you know it. Well. I will use the best resources of the lab to find out what happened to her. And keep me informed. Only me. Whatever the autopsy shows, don't tell anyone. Yes, I will, as soon as I know anything. Dr. Kruger. Ah, Dr. Taylor. Seems clear you didn't quite understand the necessity of giving Dr. Pritzi all the results of your personal research. I was just gonna speak to you about that. Let me finish, Dr. Taylor. That wasn't just a suggestion, it was an order. I-I understand perfectly. I have just received some very important information about the possible cause of the radioactive pollution in the forest. What are you talking about, Dr. Taylor? I have been working with the computer a lot. I have been monitoring the outgoing movements of the trucks assigned to handle the disposal of the radioactive waste. Now, I've amazingly found-- what have you found so amazing, Dr. Taylor? I can't be 100% sure, but I have good reason to believe that the majority of those trucks have never reached their official destination. I'm sorry, Dr. Taylor, but I have other things to do now. I would appreciate if in the future you would limit your concerns to what's going on inside the power plant instead of snooping around. Is that understood? Yes, sir, but i-- you may go now. Keep an eye on him, will you? He seems a little unstable. She must have gotten out here. Sheriff: May as well fill her up while we're at it, if you ain't too drunk to find the hose. I'm in mourning. I'm in mourning, sheriff. What'd you lose, old fellow? Your teeth? [ Laughing ] Uh, where's, uh-- where's old Chester? He's dead. I'm all alone here now. That's too bad. Jack, did a girl come by here, young, blonde hair, real short shorts? Came by the other day, and she was a pretty little thing. Said she was going to Seattle, and she said her name was Susan. Her name wassusan. She was on her way to Seattle to meet her boyfriend. Now do you believe US, sheriff? The sheriff is an asshole. Oh, for god's sake, drop it, Matt. There's nothing we can do about it. She's dead. Ever since I've been back, nothing's been going right. Well, it's not my fault. I didn't want to go to the waterfall. If we hadn't gone there, we wouldn't be mixed up in all this mess. Shit. I even got poison Ivy. Come on. If you want to fight, at least be straight about it. You act like you don't even like me anymore. Maybe I don't stack up against your big city buddies. Don't be an idiot. Now you're gonna tell me you like mature men. Come on! Maybe you'd prefer rolling around in the poison Ivy with your sophisticated city boyfriends. [ No audible dialogue ] [ No audible dialogue ] Come out of there, you filthy critter! Come out of there, or I'll shoot you! [ Gunshot ] Aahhh! Aaaahhhhh! [ Gunshot ] He's heading for the village. Catch him before he gets there. Subject is not cooperating. Just shut up and step on it. [ Tires screech ] Rum and coke, easy on the coke. You want to buy mea drink? No. How's the missus, Matt? Oh, I don't know. What'll you have, buddy? Gimme a Tequila. Hi, Matt. Mind if I sit down? I hate to drink alone. Have you ever hunted possum? [ Cocks hammer ] Over there. Thug: Dr. Taylor! We advise you to come out! [ Thug screaming ] Aaahhhh! Ohhhhh! Aaahhhh! [ Screaming continues ] [ Screaming continues ] [ Screaming continues ] [ Screaming continues ] [ Screaming stops ] You're really nice, but there's this girl, Josie. You may have seen her in town. She grew up here. I sort of promised myself I'd be faithful. That is, ever since I heard she was getting back. We grew up together right here in Littleton. Thought we'd be married one day, but she left town before she even finished high school. Couldn't wait to get away. She was a real rebel. Honey, me too. I don't blame her. A girl could starve to death in this town. One day I get this kook from the plant in here babbling about radioactivity, and now you, gorgeous kid, you want to talk about dead bodies and your girlfriend. I'd go to the city too. If this is life in the country, I'll take my chances with muggers. What was it this guy from the plant said? Something strange? Yeah. A lot of stuff. Uh... See, he told me I should beat it the hell out of here, or I was gonna wind up dead. Maybe I will. What exactly did he say? Tell me. You really care? Sheriff! Sheriff! Listen to me carefully. There's been a nuclear accident. We're all in danger. We've got to evacuate the town and the whole area, quickly. Now, calm down, and... [ sniffs ] Maybe you ought to sober up. I am stone cold sober, and if you don't do something immediately, I am going to the capital. Okay, doctor. We'll just evacuate the entire country, before you can say Jack Robinson. I'll get you authority from the capital. Take a seat, Dr. Taylor. [ Telephone rings ]You've been working too hard. Just relax. Maybe you need a rest. That guy, he was so plastered, he stumbled out of here and forgot-- forgot this. What is it? He was walking around with this? Yeah. Shit. Wish I knew what these damn numbers meant. Sheriff! Sheriff, you've got to listen! There were two men after me out there! They're dead! The entire forest is radioactive! The trees...! [ Telephone rings ] Good evening, sheriff. Ah, Dr. Kruger. Your man's here, as you expected. Thank you, sheriff. Now the important thing is that he doesn't talk to anyone-- if he didn't already. Don't worry. Billy's a good kid. I trust him. What could all these signs and numbers mean? Let's put her down! That's all for today! Bob. Found Jack's body in the woods. Not Jack! Oh, no! He was attacked by some kind of a wild animal. My guess would be a bear wandered too close to civilization. Matter of fact, I found Jack's body myself, round about sunup, couple of days ago. Sheriff, I've had a long trip, and I'm very tired. I just want to see my grandpa's body and sign the autopsy order. I'm his only kin. Well, now, son, that's a pretty tall order. The coroner ordered the body buried immediately. We tried to get in touch with you in time for the funeral, but it wasn't easy. You understand. I don't know, sheriff. All I do know is that something very strange is going on around here. Now, do you have any forms or anything I need to sign? No, no. That's okay. You're free to go. That was real shitty of you to say those things to me yesterday. Can we just drop it? I don't know. Hi. Hi. I'm looking for Bob knight. Do you know him? Yeah, he's my father. He's inside. Oh. Okay. Thank you. We got ourselves some nosey jerk. I did some checking. You know what the son of a bitch does? He's an investigative reporter for some big city newspaper. Oh, Christ! And I don't think he believed any of the shit I told him. We don't him making a connection to the power plant. We have to be very careful. You bet. Keep an eye on him. Got it. I just talked to the sheriff, and he didn't seem to know anything. Thank you, ma'am. I wish I'd looked in on old Jack more often lately. I just kept putting it off. My busiest time of year. You know. I saw grandpa last when I was 10 years old. You'd think I could get myself up here in the past 20 years. Oh, but we wrote. In his letters, he always mentioned you and your mother. He was very fond of you. We sure were fond of old Jack ourselves. I wish I could help you. I just don't know anything. Oh. Well, thank you for your time. It was very nice to meet you. Thank you. Woman: We hope you'll come to dinner before you go back to town. Talk to him. What am I gonna say to him? Okay, I will.Okay. Hey, mister. I think we should talk. I'm Josie. This is Matt. Hi, i'm, uh, Brian. We heard you been asking about some strange things that have been happening around here lately. We found a body in the woods yesterday. A young woman. You want to hear about it? A body? The strangest aspects are the fragments of vegetation-- roots, actually. Yeah, what we found inside the body of the girl. They're highly radioactive, and there are cellular oddities-- apparent genetic mutation-- which are utterly inexplicable. I'll be right there. Okay. I don't want you coming along. I don't care what you want, honey. I'm coming. [ Chuckles ] Good luck. Ten o'clock. Anything new? Yes, but you won't believe it. Please look. A most unusual genetic mutation. An appropriate word would be monstrous. What are you talking about? The cells of the fragments of these roots are growing out of all proportion. Not only that, they're feeding on plasma residue-- animal cells. [ Seething sound ] Kruger, these plants are carnivorous. I knew we shouldn't have got her involved in this. She's always late. She seems smart enough. Something's held her up. There she is. I told you she'd have a good excuse. Are you crazy? What did you bring him for? Sorry. I hope you remembered to pack a picnic basket. I'm sorry. What could I do?Great. [ Whispering ] I don't want you to marry him anymore. Don't worry, baby. What did you want to show me? Josie: What is it? It's a map. What's so special about it? You see these signs? A guy from the nuclear power plant drew 'em. God only knows what they mean, but it must be something. Some kind of measurement. "G" degrees? You don't know what it means? I know what it means! It measures nuclear radioactivity. You're damn right, kid. Okay. Some guy from the power plant goes around taking all these measurements and marking them on this map. And then the corpse from the forest disappears. And then old Jack dies. I think there's good enough reason to go look at this grave. Where'd you get that thing? Paula.who's Paula? I know who Paula is! She's the hooker! Davy! Josie: Matt? It's not what you think. Yeah? Well, what doi think, Matt? Just glad to know you have some new buddies. Come on. Josie, you and Davy stay here. Keep watch, okay? Josie: Don't worry. I thought you said this would be fun. I want to go home. Well, you can't. It's too late. [ Strikes wood ]We're there. Oh, shit! Oh, my god! I'm scared. I want to go home. Me too. Okay, sheriff, this is one reporter you don'tstonewall. He knew something about my grandfather's death, all right. His body's gone, just like the girl in the woods. [ Metallic creaking sound ]Shh. Looks like someone's coming. Let's haul. [ Gasps ] Who told you to get out of the car? We saw headlights. There's someone coming up the hill in this direction. Let's get the hell out of here. I should have thought of it earlier. Damn nosey jerk! Fill up the grave. We don't want anyone seeing it come daylight. I'm gonna find that troublemaker. [ Gasps ] Aaahhhh! Ooohhhh! Aaahhhh! Your grandfather was burying the dog over here somewhere, but I wasn't paying attention. There's the marker right there. Hopefully the dog's body will tell US something. I wouldn't trouble myself, boys. In the house. Well? Josie: What happened? Well! Looks like a family reunion! [ Laughs ] Let's see if I can find out what to do with you. [ Glass shatters ] [ All screaming ] Aahhh! [ Glass shatters ] [ Screaming continues ] [ Screaming continues ] [ Screaming continues ] Davie: Who are we gonna call, anyway?Brian: Yeah, who? Matt: I don't know, but we've got to call somebody for help. Doesn't matter anyway. The lines are out. Matt: Great. What are we gonna do now? Josie, I'll take you and Davy home so you can tell your mother what's going on. Brian, you can use my other car. We've got to warn everybody. Come on. [ Busy signal ] Okay, listen. We'll meet at echo cafe. Now hurry! Okay, come on. You get a flashlight and meet me back here, okay? I'll get mom. Mom! Mom, wake up! Wake up!Josie! What's the matter?We've got to get out of here. What's happened? Are you okay?Yeah. Where's Davy?Waiting outside. Put this on. I'll explain on the way. We have to warn the others. What others? Who?Come on! Where's Davy? He's so slow. I'll get him. Josie's back in town! What are you doing, Davy? I told you to wait outside. I'm looking for my space shooter. We don't need it. Come on. [ Pulsing sound ] Aah![ Pulsing sound ] Josie: Davy! [ Whip-like pop ] Aah! [ Screaming continues ] [ Josie screams ] [ Screaming ] [ Engine revs ] [ Engine revs ] [ Engine revs ] [ Engine revs ] [ Engine revs ] [ Engine revs ] [ Root snaps ] Woman: Come on. You've got to reach for it. Come on. Turn around here. Look what I got. Come on, come on. Yeah. Aw, come on. Good boy. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Ominous crackling sound ] [ Woman screaming ] [ Screaming ] Hello? Hey! Anyone home? Hey, you're in danger! Say-- say, it's an emergency! Is anyone there? Come out! You're in great danger! Hey! Hey, the woods are full of killer roots! [ Gunshot ]Son of a bitch! Aah![ Gunshot ] [ Man groaning ] [ Horse whinnying ]Mom? Where are you? Ohh! Ohh! Aah! Aah! [ Groans with exertion ] [ Groans ] No! Get up quick, dad! [ Rooster crows ] [ Knocking on door ] Hello? [ Knocking on door ] Hello? Anyone home? Can you hear me? [ Knocking on door ] This is an emergency! Open up, quick! Hey, your life is in danger! Come out, quick! Man: Go away, or I'll shoot you! Jesus! Where are they? I hope they're okay! It's Matt! You all okay? Where's Brian?I thought he was with you. No, we split up. He was gonna warn people on the edge of town. I went home. It's terrible. My house was attacked. Our house was attacked too. They got my grandmother. Looks like Brian. Someone else can go give the alarm. I give up. Son-of-a-bitches, they shot at me! They can just die in their houses. I think we should call the national guard. This is a national emergency. Whoa, whoa! Let's not panic. Whatever's going on around here seems related to the nuclear plant. That's right. The numbers on the map were written by a guy from the power plant. We'd better call and tell 'em what's going on. They'll know how to handle the situation. The phone lines are out. I guess the roots took the wires down. And my radio's broken. I took it in to Jeff just the other day. I guess we just have to go there and tell them it's an emergency. She's right. We'd better move. Somebody should warn the people. Don't look at me. I'll take care of it. Now go! You meet US back here, mom. Be careful. It's Taylor. He works at the plant. Please. It's a question of life and death. I need to get to the nuclear plant. Can you give me a ride? Jump in. Hurry. You know what's happening here. Explain. I discovered that the radioactive waste from the nuclear power plant had never been removed to its official destination. What do you mean? What's happened to it? They dumped it somewhere in the forest. How could they do that? When $2 million is involved, there is no "why." But a radioactive leak causes predictable results. We know them. That doesn't explain the killer roots. I don't know how to explain the killer roots. I'm not a microbiologist. We do know that radioactivity influences DNA, the gene code. Mutations? The radioactivity penetrated only into the woods. It penetrated the root system of the trees, which is like a nervous system. That's why the trees dried out. The roots, assimilating all the nutrients, let the rest of the trees die. I've lived among the woods all my life. I can't believe that's possible. You'd better believe it, 'cause it's happening. We've got to convince this madman before someone else dies. [ Knocking on door ] Lucy belle! Bill! It's Denise! Come out! Bill better have a darn good reason for not listening to Jack's grandson. There has been a radioactive leak, and I am sure it has something to do with what's going on. Dr. Taylor, I've had enough of you. You're fired! Good! Then I won't have to go to prison when all this is out. And rest assured, you're not going to get off easy. Depends on how you look at it, Taylor. I have no doubts as to what is happening. The fact is, it's too late. Nothing can be done about it now. It's not too late. Let US use your radio. We can call the national guard. We shouldn't have let them try it. Now they've acquired a taste for it. They like it. They're hungry for more. You're crazy. We know that you embezzled funds intended for the toxic waste disposal, and you took the radioactive waste and dumped it somewhere in the forest! We're gonna find it. Tell US where the waste site is before it's too late. So you haven't found the site yet. Maybe there is no waste site. Tell US where the site is, for Christ's sake! We've got you now, kruger. You might as well cooperate. Youwant meto cooperate? [ Laughing maniacally ] [ Maniacal laughter continues ] You can kill US, but you're never gonna get away with it. Oh, no. They're never going to get me. [ Gunshot ] We've got to find the source of the radioactivity so we can stop the spread of the contamination. But how? We'll never find the site. We've got to do something before it's too late. Davie: Maybe we can call some people for help. Yeah. Maybe we can call the environmental protection agency. They're the only ones who are even remotely qualified for this. No, no. We don't have enough time. If we get involved with people from Washington, there's no telling how long it'll take. Look, it is the onlyway. No. It's yourway, but it's not the onlyway. All right. Then go ahead. And good luck. I'm not going. Davie: Geek. If only somebody would come and help US. [ Vans and trucks approaching ] They arecoming. [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Indistinct chatter continues ] ...we'll all need the shovels. Bob: Yeah, thank you. Matt: ...Whatever it takes. Paula, thanks for coming to help US out. Woman: Thanks, Paula.[ Crowd murmurs agreement ] Take her down over here. I think that's the area we've got to go to, over there. [ Geiger counter crackling ] Let me check this. Check it with the geiger counter here, Bob. I think we need to go down over this way, over by that black Ridge. Do you see anything? Not yet, but we must be close. The geiger counter's going off the scale. [ Geiger counter crackling ] Down there. I think we've found it. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, put her down. Jesus, there must be hundreds of 'em. We'd better go back and tell the others. Yeah. It'll take forever to dig 'em up. [ Geiger counter crackling ] [ Ominous crackling sound ] [ Whip-like whoosh ] Aah! Whoa! [ Taylor screams ] Taylor! [ Screaming ] Oh, god! Oh, no! [ No audible dialogue ] [ Fires flare ] Look. What's that? Matt: It's a flare rocket. They must have found the site. Maybe they're in trouble. Josie: What are we gonna do? Matt? It's coming from the canyon, but I don't see them coming back. Maybe we'd better go there. We'll have to find them. Let's go to the canyon. Come on, let's go. Yeah, let's go! Man: Hurry! [ Helicopter engine struggling ] If this is it, we'd better start digging! We should find my father first. He's got to be nearby. Man: Yeah. I found him! I found him! Matt, don't go. There's nothing you can do. [ Ominous crackling sound ] [ Chainsaw revs ] Man: Careful. There's one underneath it. Be careful now. There's another one over here. Oh, my god. Man: Careful! Careful! [ Whip-like whoosh ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming continues ] [ Screaming continues ] Aahhh! [ Groans ] Hey, Gordon, I found another one over here. Aahhh! Aah! Help! Help! [ Both screaming ] Aah! Aah! [ Josie screams ] It's useless, Matt. There's too many of them. There's nothing we can do. We've got to stop 'em! Have you seen Davy? Aah! Oh, god! Aah! Aaahhh! [ Screaming continues ] [ Whip-like popping ] Denise: Has anyone here seen Davy? Townspeople: No. Davy! Mom! Paula's dead! Paula was killed, and four of the others are dead. We're gonna die... Just like the others. What's that? Who is he? I don't know, but his timing is perfect. Is everyone all right? Brian! What made you change your mind? Well... remember when you said we had to do it ourselves? I finally realized, I amone of you. Listen, Brian, good luck with your article. Huh. I wish. I've been given a gag order. Josie, where's your luggage? I'm not coming. I just came to say goodbye. In fact, maybe you could send my stuff from the city for me. No problem.
