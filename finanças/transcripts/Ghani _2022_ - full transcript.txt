Welcome to National Boxing championship. Today is going to be a historical day for South India. Yes, Harsha. A player from Andhra Pradesh has made it to the finals. In another few minutes, the match is going to begin. The match is going to begin soon. Hurry up and come. None other than Vikramaditya! Mom... What is it? You’ve played hooky today? How can Practice be more important than watching dad’s match? What a smooth talker you’ve become, Ghani. By the end of the third round, Vikram is in lead. (Crowd cheering) Winning is not wrong. But trying to win at all costs is wrong. Sir, this issue is very much alive in the national media. We have to take serious action on this. I'm considering this issue so seriously. Mr. Vikram is taking drugs. Until we get a clarity on whether or not Mr. Vikram and some of the other players are taking drugs, I am putting a ban on players from A.P. Disgusting! Calling himself a champion! I am ashamed to call Vikram our colleague. Quick! Quick! Hurry up! What happened, sir? Why are you removing the boxing ring? You sent Vikram to do some wonders, didn’t you? Well, he managed to get the boxing ring removed! Is it just him? Or are you guys taking steroids as well? What do you mean, sir? Andhra Pradesh has been banned from boxing for one whole year. There’s nothing to be done here. Out! Get lost! Krishna... allocate this space for badminton. Hey, you are cheating just like your father. In that last match, I am sure you won by cheating. Give me my cup back! I am not a cheater. I will not give you the cup! Give him back his cup! Give it! Why did you throw the cycle down? Why did you grab my collar? Let it go! Let it go! Give it. Give me my cup. That’s mine Hey! Hey! Stop it! Why are you guys fighting? What is this? Aren’t you Vikram Aditya’s son? Our colony has lost its reputation because of your father. I thought Vikram is a good guy but he proved me wrong I am ashamed of that Vikram is our neighbor Boxing game banned in our state due to Vikram's mistake. Andhra Pradesh's reputation was tarnished by his father Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Cheater! Open the door. Open the door. Open the door first. Open the door. Come out! -Open the door. Don’t be scared, son. Nothing will happen. What's the fuss? Nothing will happen. Call the police. Mother, why did father do that? I don’t have an answer... to the question you asked me. But... in this situation... we cannot stay here. Let’s go somewhere else. Ghani... promise me one thing. Promise that you would never take up boxing in your life ever again. Promise me. Promise! We take care of plants. Plants will take care of us. Save trees. Save earth. Children, do you know… ….as per UN reports, for every person in Canada there are 7000 trees, in Russia it’s 4000 trees [per person] and US has 700 trees [per person.] But, in our country, for every person there are only 28 trees. Ramu? How many saplings does we have? It must be around 4000. If it’s 4000, that’s okay. We are better than the US. We need to protect our trees and plant new ones. Children, I am going to give each one of you a sapling. You all need to promise me that you are going to plant it. Promise teacher. (All together) It’s easy to make a promise. But, keeping your promise is very difficult. Make sure you keep up your word. Okay, ma’am. Bangari... Yeah, come here children. Come and take the saplings. Thank you, Madhuri. You’ve educated the children on plants very well. The children spend most of the time in classroom and amongst books. This is a really different experience. Well, what is our student Ghani up to? Oh? Ghani is studying his final year Engineering. Okay. Recently he started took up a computer course. It gets late in the evenings. He must be busy with his studies. You are very lucky, Mom. In fact, Ghani is a good and quiet student. Oh, thank you. Is there anyone else to fight him? Final fight 1:10? Yes! There is someone. How much is the bet? You look very scrawny and about to croak. Are you going to fight? Look at my man here. If he lands a punch on you, you are going to be flying in the air. Do you need this at your age? Do you know who you are talking about?! He is Sikkol Lokaraju. 20 knockouts, 30 wins and four-time championship. Bro, you shouldn’t claim others laurels as your own. I don’t think I am the right opponent for your guy. My student would do. Student? He says his student! Ask that Kiddo to come. The game is gonna be ours. Ghani! Come on, Ghani. You should hit hard him to crush his nose and break his jaw If you keep instructing him like that, they are not going to consider you as his coach. Instead, you would be regarded as a cook. You shut up. You go ahead and fight. No! no! Oh no! Is this how you coach? What are you looking at? Do something Ghani… Yeah! Come on! Ghani! What did you tell him, coach? He was in really good form there. I told him that his opponent’s name is Vikram. Does he hate that name very much? No, he hates his father. Coach looks like you’ve been paid well today. How about a party tonight? You must be wondering why I’m doing all this. If he wants to learn boxing, he needs a room, he needs to pay rent, and needs good professional equipment. Along with those things, he needs a good coach as well. You wait. Your high voltage punches have completely knocked him down. His wounds need to be treated Buddy, you won. Why do you look dull? It’s not about winning here. I need to win in the boxing ring. I promised my mother that I would never take up boxing. But I had already decided right when I was a child that my life is going to be about boxing. Every time I break the promise I made her, it leaves me in little pain. I keep wondering if I am cheating my mother. If you are that worried about it, why do you even pursue this sport? some questions in our lives remain unanswered. That’s because of my father. There is just one answer to all those questions. That is to win the national championship. Ghani... you have already started on your journey to success. From now on, you are going to be successful in every venture. Party! Yay! Hey... Hey... Save even half of it. Good morning, mom. Those who sleep in the night and wake up in the morning say ‘Good morning’. When did you get home last night? Between 11 and 11:15. He's very smart! Why did you get late? I went to a movie, mother. What movie? Bheemla Nayak What theatre? Jagadamba. Which show? First show, mother. Show me the tickets. Here. Why do you constantly keep questioning me like some traffic police? You might think that I am interrogating you. But for me, it’s concern Mom… What happened to Deepa in the serial ‘Kartika Deepam’? I forgot to tell you. Sit down. Ghani! Getting late There you guys are! Instead of wasting your time with these idiots... why don’t you bring a girl and introduce her to me as your girlfriend? I am waiting for it. Please get her soon sir I am unable to do all the work by myself. Did you hear that? Mother, I beg you. Please, I am getting late. Bye. Bye. Ghani… Ghani… Madam… Bye! He's going Madam, these are… I know that they are not tickets. They are ATM slips. If you knew about it, why did you let him go instead of reprimanding him? You cannot bring a child or a young man closer to you by reprimanding him. They will distance themselves. He is my only child. If he is happy, that’s enough for me. Why shouldn't you take care? - Why shouldn't you take care? Instead of trusting you, if I wrote the question papers twice in my answer sheet, he would have given me 10 marks. Set aside the fact that he wrote. How could you have copied from him? I saw how confident he was and spent 2000 bucks on food. The torture that Ramachari inflicts upon us in the classroom and the fact that there are no girls in my life, is making my hormones dry. Do you know how the girls of Geetham college ought to be? When there are flowers raining from up above, and they walk past us like that… Buddy, look at that girl. If the girl is really that beautiful, she must already be in a relationship with someone. Don’t waste your time or energy and just tell me what you want. I don’t want anything. You go and get what you want. Hi, Bobby, Siddhu, Rohit…. How are you guys? Do you know us? What do you mean? I am Maya. Didn’t Ghani tell you? -About what? About our love story. Didn’t he tell you that I am his girlfriend? In love? -Really? Oh god Narayana! Yes! Yes, our love story began in Narayana college. As soon as I saw him, Ghani proposed his love to me. He must have done it. He got in relationship with the girl and diverted us. You continue. And I said yes. -That quickly? Do you want logic or do you want me to continue? You shut up. You please continue. After that, our love story scaled beautiful heights. We went on dates to RK Beach Road and Jagadamba Center. Our love story went public and reached every nook and cranny. Interesting. After that? My father got to know about our love story. Oh no! What happened? My father shifted me to a hostel and put a break in our relationship. These fathers! What happened after that? I searched for Ghani and came all the way here. Stop that. Hi... You asked me to wait at the office. What are you doing here? Do you already know her? I know all of you as well. How? We are all from the same colony. She is new joining. She is Ghani’s girlfriend. I really don’t know who she is. What’s going on? A small prank. Prank?? If I had given you an ordinary introduction, I would have ended up as a contact in your phones. But now, you are going to remember me for the rest of my life. Oh goodness! She’s isn’t an ordinary girl. Thank you. Thank you. Get up Sir... It’s been an hour since Ghani came. I don’t think you are up to it. Coach. Ghani... Did you finish all the formalities for the selection match? All done, my boy. The selections are on the next Sunday and will rock it. Ghani! -What happened? Buddy! Time to celebrate... Hey! This is not the time for celebration. Ghani, the actual game is going to begin now. The player who is up next is well trained and fully prepared… …with a proper coach. Like me, right? Coach! No matter how prepared they are or well-trained they are, I don’t have any other option, other than to win. I am ready to face anyone. Hi dad! What a pleasant surprise, dad! What else can I do? Do you know how many months it’s been since you came home? Practice, dad. We have lots of wealth. A father like me would want his son to either enjoy the wealth they earned or join the business and take it to the next level But you on the other hand… …boxing and all that. Do you really need to take such a risk? Identity, dad. Even though you have a lot of wealth, you are one among the rich. Is there anyone who would recognize you without your wealth? I am crazy about boxing. It’s my identity. When I get into the boxing ring and begin to fight, And when I am winning the game, I enjoy the high it gives me. Once I win the nationals. My range will be on national range. My brand image would be created. Then I'll take over the business I want to win when the entire world is watching. All the best, my boy. Thank you, dad. Mom, coffee. I’ll be back. Our colony has lost its reputation because of your father. I am ashamed of that Vikram is our neighbor I thought Vikram is a good guy but he proved me wrong Ghani, coffee. Ghani.... No, mother. Didn’t you just ask me for it? In India, when two people meet, the topics that are usually discussed are sports, movies and politics. In sports, Olympics and Commonwealth games are usually conducted every four years. But, after those games, for the next four years, people forget about those games. There is a cricket event every month. There are series as well with sponsors. That is why that game has become very popular. Even though there are many talented sportspeople in every sport... they do not have the right platform and are left behind. Most of these games have very recently begin to acquire viewership. Just as with IPL, a lot of players have come to light with the Pro Kabbadi and Pro Badminton series. In the same manner, we are privatizing boxing to create a platform for talented boxers. That is IBL. Indian Boxing League. All the details and schedules regarding IBL will be announced soon. Boxing will very soon become the buzzing topic in everyone’s conversation. Thank you. Bloody Cheaters Good morning, Bangari. I don’t want your Good Mornings. Mother, is there no Sambar (Lentil stew)? Sambar ? Mom... what are you looking at? Serve me some breakfast. So you eat your breakfast only when I serve you? Do you inform me of everything you do? Who is Maya? Do you know Maya, mother? Who is Maya? She is my friend. She is from my college. Is that all? That is all, mom. What else can there be? A while ago, she came home. She came home? Aunty, do you have some Sambar? Who are you? Who am I? Ghani didn’t tell you? What should he have told me? That I am his Lover. Lover? You might be shocked that I told you all this after so much has happened. But that was the situation I was in. What was that situation? What was that situation? Second month? Goodness! What? Just some random girl comes and tells you something, and you believe it, is it? Don’t you trust your son even a little bit? She came this far and moved about the house and told us this. Is there a reason we should not believe her? You shut up. My mother knows me well. You mean…there is nothing going on. Maya! Thank god! What are you going to do tomorrow? -I am sure I’ll think of something. Maya…Maya…Maya… I need to speak to you. I never believed that one could fall in love at first sight. But when I saw you for the first time... I don’t know what it is but I felt something. Getting to know you is magic. You cast some spell on me. I want to be with you… I want to constantly stay with you… I keep constantly thinking these thoughts. Why go that far? You’ve cast a spell on my mother as well. I want to stay forever in this magic with you. Maya... I love you. Buddy, such passion in your confession! Did you see that? If my buddy here decides to prank you, you have no other option than to be blown away! Let’s go. She was shocked Now she never does pranks What’s going on with you? If someone is pranked, they get irritated. If not, they retaliate. You on the other hand are enjoying it. What else can I do but enjoy it. I’ve been waiting for three years. I wanted to hear this from him. If he confessed to me so passionately just as a prank... imagine how passionate he would be if he really loved me. ♪Like Juliet to Romeo. ♪ ♪Like the satellite to the Radio, ♪ ♪Like the beating of the heart. ♪ ♪Shall I remain so for you? ♪ ♪Like an invisible chocolate♪ ♪Like your magnetic smile♪ ♪I like all of you♪ ♪Like the gorgeous moon. ♪ ♪Like the theory that Newton discovered, ♪ ♪My heart keeps being pulled. ♪ ♪Shall I take a u turn and keep you company like a shadow? ♪ ♪If you ask me to describe my love for you, ♪ ♪Like the poet Veturi or Nanduri, ♪ ♪I don’t think all the languages of this world would be enough. ♪ ♪Like Juliet to Romeo. ♪ ♪Like the satellite to the Radio, ♪ ♪Like the beating of the heart. ♪ ♪Shall I remain so for you? ♪ ♪Did the cloud perch down here for me? ♪ ♪Happiness entered my life and brought me joy. ♪ ♪Until yesterday, I did not like myself as much as I do now. ♪ ♪And suddenly, even my breath is sounding like a soft lullaby. ♪ ♪Like Juliet to Romeo. ♪ ♪Like the satellite to the Radio, ♪ ♪Like the beating of the heart. ♪ ♪Shall I remain so for you? ♪ Yes! Hey guys... Are you ready for some action? Welcome to the Race night! Come on Krish! Who is this weekend hero? Who will race against him? Anybody? Nobody is there? Adi... you might be a champion in the boxing ring. But when it comes to racing, I am the champion. Be it the boxing ring or the race, I am still the champion. Just wait. Superb! The race has started. Adi is raising. Cheers! I know Adi will do it. 100% for sure. What happened? Road block. I think it's racing? Hey, no... Maya What are you doing? Maya, please. What man? You seem to be overdoing it just because there’s a girl riding on your bike? Get lost! You wait... I'll take care of him. Maya! What’s going on with you? You are blocking the road and creating a ruckus? Of course, we will create a ruckus. Our wish. You think this road belongs to you? Clear it! Clear it! Yes, it’s my father’s. what is your problem? Yes, I have a problem with it. So, clear it! Not possible. -Bro…Bro… Sorry... Sorry. You guys carry on. Sorry. Idiots! Maya, why bother with those fellows? Idiot! -Come at me! Why did you apologize to him? It’s not wrong to apologize to him in this situation. You seem to be running you mouth off. Don’t you know how to behave with women? What’s this nuisance in the middle of the night? That is exactly what I am asking. What’s this nuisance in the middle of the night? Are these races being conducted without your knowledge? And they are harassing girls! Sir, if this gets public, it’s going to damage your reputation. Whatever it is, deal with it later. Just let this go for now, sir. Please, sir. Ghani... do you want some ice-cream? Are you always like this? Don’t you take anything seriously? Why wouldn’t I? I am seriously in love with you. Don’t you get it? I know that you understand, Ghani. What is your problem? I don’t like it. Don’t like it? Maya, you are very special. You are naughty, the way you talk…everything. They say that some people make you forget the entire world. If I am with you, I will forget myself. And I don’t like to forget myself. The Ghani you see and the Ghani that I am are different, Maya. …for a girl like you. I am not the right person… My goals and my priorities are different. The journey that I am on, I don’t know what is going to happen when or even where. I don’t think we can be in a relationship. And I don’t think you can understand either. Why won’t I understand it? This isn’t some sort of a lesson for you to understand me. This is life. In my life, love is a mere disturbance. And I don’t want to be disturbed. Disturbance? My love is a disturbance? Maya! Maya! Dear! What happened? I can understand if he doesn’t love me. He does love me but says that I am a disturbance. He will know my pain if I avoid him I already imagined his future. So, it started now. Father… Hello! about girl friend! This is called out focus. Let's go. He escaped! Someday, we will catch him in Vizag. The day we catch him, it’s going to be his last. Let’s go. You shouldn’t mess with a right person in a wrong situation. I already forgot about what happened that day and moved on. But you guys are still stuck there. Let it go. I'll let it go. Come on, Ghani... And the Zonal area winner is Mr. Ghani. Yes! Hi. Maya... You came to the match yesterday? Why didn’t you tell me? What should I tell you? You said that I was a disturbance. Is that why you’ve been avoiding me for the past two days? It’s my wish. That is what I am going to do. Stop it Maya! Alright, please forget about that. I beg you. In another few minutes, somebody is going to knock on the door of your home. Why? Did you come here again? Don’t be stressed. I didn’t come. I sent you a very good gift. Gift? What is it? Why ruin the surprise by telling it? Go and see for yourself. I will only accept it if you tell me what it is. If not, I am going to send it away. No! No! No! I will tell... I sent you the boxing gloves as a gift. Maya? You mean you’ve patched up? It’s none of your business. Go about your work. What is it? Shouldn’t I see it? Who asked you to send me gloves? I only sent you gloves, right? Why are you overreacting? In just a matter of a second, my 15-year-old dream would have been shattered. I would have to forgo everything. What are you talking about, Ghani? Generally, when someone knocks on the door, people in the house don’t look at the door. They look at their father. It’s because of the belief that one’s father wouldn’t let the problem get to them. What if that very father is the problem? In everyone’s life, their father is their role model, Maya. It’s the same for me. On how a father shouldn’t be. I experienced a lot of pain when I was young. I had only two options then. One... live by the promise I made to my mother and stay far away from certain things and live quietly. Two... bring back our happiness that our father lost and my mother’s respect. That is why I learnt boxing, Maya. Despite such pain... how are you able to stay normal, Ghani? Do you know what’s the most difficult thing in this world? It is to make the other person believe that you are happy. That is exactly what my mother and I have been doing for the past 15 years. She told me to forget. And she pretends that she has forgotten. One day, she is going to find out the truth. Even the lie knows that its days are numbered. That is why whenever I got the opportunity, I kept prolonging that lie. If someday, mother gets to know about the truth... It should be on the day that I win the National Boxing Championship. That is my goal. Being in love isn’t just about loving that person. It also means sharing their problems and their responsibilities. I am always with you. I love you, Ghani. For the past 15 days, the state competitions at the state championship have seen a lot of enthusiasm. It is now time for the final. We are proud to announce the finalists for the state championship. Winner Ghani from Zonal A. Adi from Zonal B. Please welcome them on to the Dias with a big round of applause. Ah! Finally, caught you. I am happy that I am in the finals. But I am happier because you are my opponent. That day, you didn’t just mess with me. You messed with my ego. Pray to god. Make sure you survive maximum number of rounds. That day, since we were out, I held back my punches. Tomorrow, in the ring, there will be no such restrictions. Pray to God. Ask him to save you from me. Good luck. Hello! Is he the son of Vikramaditya? Confirm? Yes, it’s him. Confirmed. I am coming. How many bonsai plants do you have? There are none left, madam. You tell me that now? Immediately place an order for them. Yes, madam. Madam, I have some happy news. Happy news? Your son’s picture is in the newspaper. Ghani... In the blue corner Ghani... In the red corner Adi... Boxers... shake hands Come on, Ghani. Go to your corners Cool Ghani! Stop! Go to your corners Wow! Ghani! Give your best, Ghani! Is this energy given by your girlfriend? Can I take my chance with her too? What’s going on? You are playing with such gusto. Did you take steroids like your dad? You must have. You are really his son. Ghani! Stop! I am warning you Why is he behaving contrary to the rules? What is this? Damn it! Ghani! Ghani is being disqualified because he played a foul game and went out of control. We stop this boxing match and are now announcing Adi as our State Champion for this year. Why are you angry? Is it because you lost the match? Or because you didn’t keep your promise? It’s because I was born as Vikram Aditya’s son! It’s because he’s been an obstacle every step of my way. …because he made me lie to you! And because he made me lose today! He committed the crime. And I’ve been suffering these horrendous consequences for the crime I didn’t commit for the past fifteen years, mother. He gave me life and ruined it! Is he even a human being?! What the hell are you talking about? Did I ever tell you that he committed a crime? I was worried that something might happen to you and so I forbade you to take up boxing. Even if you hit me or make excuses for him, he is a bloody cheater! Stop it, Ghani. Would you say this if you won the match? If you win, the credit goes entirely to you. And if you lose, it’s your father’s fault?! It’s against the spirit of the sport, Ghani. Who the hell are you? What do you know? I know that Vikram Aditya. That Vikram Aditya that no one knows about. I saw him a few inches away, three feet above the ground and in 60 x 20 boxing ring. On that way... I was Vikram Aditya’s opponent in the game. He was easily one of the best boxers in the history of India. We all fought to won the game. But he fought to make sure that the boxing sport became the highlight. The power of his punch was known only to the wind that resisted his hand. Even though his feet moved, only the boxing ring knew his game. He is one of the greatest fighters and the world didn’t know about it. That is Vikram Aditya. Come on, Vikram... come on. The new state champion is Vikram Aditya. Wow! Thank you so much, sir. As soon as I requested, you added boxing into the school sports. Ghani, when you grow up... you must become as big a champion as your father is. Sure, sir. My father is my role model. Vicky, the national notification is out. There’s just one month left until your dream becomes true. All the best. Thank you, Eswar. Thank you. Congrats, sir. All the best. Thank you. Congrats. What happened? Why aren’t you wearing the gloves? How can I afford it, brother? Even though I raised the issue with the federation, no one pays any attention to it. Be that the case, we cannot stop practicing, isn’t it? Here, take it. Use these gloves. Thank you, brother. What’s up, Madhuri? What are you doing? I am putting up my hero’s cup. -What do you mean? You might be the state champion. But, for me, my son is my champion. Does that mean I don’t matter anymore? Looks like someone is jealous. Why would I be jealous? I am very proud. When I see strangers engage in boxing, I take a lot of delight in it. When my very own son is on the path to becoming a big boxer, I am very happy. For every son, his father is his first role model. I wish for my son to grow up and become a big boxer, and become a role model for a lot of people. My hero will definitely become one. Daddy... What happened? Ramesh got injured while practicing. Really? Doctor... how is Ramesh? He is out of danger. My god! He has an important match in two days. Vikram, he is just out of danger. Why would you talk about the match? He cannot continue his career any longer. Sir, what are you saying? He hurt his eye because he practiced without a guard. His optical nerve has been damaged and he lost his eye sight. He can no longer pursue boxing. How is it that as players, you can’t take even the basic of precautions? If they give us, why would we refuse? But they should first provide us with gloves. What if they don’t give? You mean to say you will not get your hands on them? He just lost an eye today. Tomorrow, someone may lose their life. Anything can happen. Hope you understand. How many lives are you going to play around because of your incompetency? Ramesh's life and his career are completely shattered. Vikram, you are crossing your limits. Limits? Did you look at his hands? Did you notice the injuries on his hands? Do you know the ambition and hope behind those injuries? I am worried if they would all turn into champions or just end up like Ramesh. You think we are responsible for all this? Boxing is a contact game. Don’t you know the risk of injury in this sport? Why are you talking as if no boxer in the world goes through injuries? We are well aware that while boxing, there could be injuries. If those injuries are because we fought for our state or our country... we are happy to subject ourselves to such injuries. How ridiculous that one’s career ended because there are no facilities provided in practice? Isn’t every sport federation provided with monetary support from the government? What are you doing with it? Sir, do you have some change? You asked me about funds, right? The amount of funds that the central government allocates is… …one rupee. After removing the salaries and other monthly expenditures, the amount left is 50 paise. There are 22 sports in Sports Authority’s list. When that fifty paise is distributed amongst the 22 sports, Boxing is left with 5 paise. That means, there is no change. A cheap sport that does not have even the minimum of funds. A cheap sport? If you split the funds that way, the sport will be left with peanuts. If you reduce the amount of money you spend on eating out and your unnecessary drives... players can be provided with proper kits. Just because you won the state championship, you’ve gotten aggressive. There are many who went to the nationals before you just to make a mark. And none of them ever did. You got a few of your buddies along and are showing off your clout, is it? Do you know what would happen if I get as aggressive as you? What are you going to do, sir? Vicky. Wait. Sir. I will take care of it, sir. Sir, that is not it… -Vikram. -Sir… -Move. Tell in a way that he understands. You there, get me a cup of hot tea. Okay sir. I have a splitting headache because of this. Do you all even know what you’re doing? Vicky. Come to reality. Just because you come and create a fuss, is Rajesh can play boxing again? Do you think you’ll get the equipment if you get aggressive? There needs to be certain achievements and a stature for you to even demand things and get them. First, win the nationals. I will win, sir. I will do it for sure. Not for the sake of winning for myself. I will win to make sure that this sport gets its due recognition. I will win to make sure that all the hopes and ambitions of those who believe in this sport win too. That’s the spirit. Vikram, do you even know what you are doing? Are you going to forgo such as plum government post just for a sport that has no patronage or an audience? Looking at you, I feel like someday, you are going to drag your family down onto the streets. People take up a job for the reason of security. But people flock to a sport because of a certain madness. They want to play for the state. And they want to win for the nation. But the problem with the society is that – whoever wins is proclaimed as one of their own. And nobody encourages those who want to win. The nationals are very important for me, sir. I don’t need a job that is an obstacle to my boxing. That is not what I meant, Vikram. Sir... Sir, if I wanted your opinion, I would have listened to you. I am informing you of my decision. Hope you understand. Thank you, sir. The most important quality of a player is ambition. This system is making sure that ambition is nothing more than a thought. All the players think that I will be assured of a good future when I win the match. But I doubt if that would happen. You are right! But, what more could you have done? I should do something, Madhuri. I must. Just thinking about those boxers like me who are interested in the sport... but are not given the necessary support, is making me upset. Until yesterday, I thought becoming a champion was enough. But now, I want to create a platform for such people. Bharat Boxing Academy. In there, it’s enough if the boxers are interested in training in Boxing and are determined to win. The Institute will provide them with all the necessary facilities. In the future, they are going to play at the state level, national level and even internationally. They will make sure that India is proud of the achievements of its boxers. Vijendra Sinha. Defending Champion. Very aggressive boxer. Now all eyes are on him. All those who are sponsoring the nationals are sponsoring him. If you win, it’s altogether, an entirely different high. There will be people, media and following. This is what real success looks like. Are you tensed? Why would I be tensed? If the opponent is very skilled, one can enjoy the game even more. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. It’s the first time that a South Indian player has come to the finals. How do you feel? Very happy. My life is boxing. Representing the state and the country in the sport gives me a lot of happiness when compared to having a job. That is the magic of sports. There are many occasions where countries got recognized because of sportsmen. That is what’s great about these games. Your defending champion, Mr. Vijendra Sinha, seems very confident. No matter what happens, there can only be one winner. No matter who wins, ultimately, it’s the sport that should shine bright. I will be the one winning this. Everyone here has come to win. But I am the brand ambassador of winning. Congratulations on reaching the finals, Vikram. Thank you, sir. But I am not able to wish you the best. You know everything. As national sponsors, we are the ones who are sponsoring Sinha. If Sinha doesn’t win this match, we are going to face a huge loss. It will damage our reputation. Point. Next year, we will be the ones sponsoring Vikram. At the same time, we will pay him twice the price money that is being offered to the winner now. Vikram should lose the finals. What are you saying? You can put the logo of your brand on a player’s jersey. That is your business. There is nothing wrong with that. But, for the sake of your brand, it’s completely brutal to ask a player to lose the match. Please remember this. Anywhere or anytime, you can only sponsor the game. You cannot command the player. We will give more money. If you say something more or even if you stay here any longer, I don’t know how I will be reacting. What did you do?! Vikram! I hope you understood our decision. If you turn this into an issue, we might have to complain to the sports authority. Get out! Vicky, the good news is… …you are sure to win. Really? Such politics? Earlier, I was struggling to even pay for learning the sport... But now, here they are, ready to pay you to lose the match. They turned sports into business. -Please forget about all that. There’s just one more day until your dreams are realized. Mom, I'll talk to Dad. Please be careful. All the best. Dad... Hey, Ghani. Welcome to National Boxing Championship. You’ve made a lot of sacrifices to come this far. Now it is a chance. You can do it, Vikram. Don’t think about anything else. Just go and fight. The victory is ours. Come on, all the best. Vijay, these players are not new to you. And this boxing ring isn’t new either. Neither are these people new. Nor is the victory. Just knock him around. Come on! Come on Vicky. 90 seconds until you become a champion. 90 seconds to realize the hopes of all those who believed in you. Okay, Vicky. Keep it up, come on.. Vicky. Vicky! Cheers! Congratulations, Mr. Vijendra Sinha. Just as you predicted, you won for the second time. I will be the one winning the Commonwealth games as well. All the best. Hey, I am Shanta. The man of the day. Thank you so much. Why are you looking like that? Aren’t you going to thank him? Thank him? Why? What do you mean? If it wasn’t for him, we wouldn’t have won the tournament today. If you make a person an offer, he should either be excited about it or is in need of it. Vikram has neither. But I have the need. What you’re asking isn’t Vikram’s defeat. You are asking for a player’s dream. It is about some players’ career. And beyond that, it is about the trust he placed in me. Excite me more. Sir, how is the player? I am sorry to say this. Mr. Vikram Aditya died due to steroid overdose. Bloody cheater! Are you going to complain to the board? Everyone here is the same. The amount the board pays us in salaries isn’t enough. If the sponsors see you lose, their brand value plummets. So, media will not have any business. Opportunities such as this, very rarely fall into my lap. We’ve already divided the share. With your share, enjoy the victory that isn’t yours. Don’t overreact. Okay, Champ? One man’s greed destroyed two players lives. At that time, I was in a situation where I knew everything and yet couldn’t do anything. I tried really hard to find you. But you didn’t have any identity. Ghani, your father wasn’t just some big player. He was a man with great ideals and vision. "The unsurmountable amount of pain that you experienced when you were blamed is beyond imagination." "Father! Father! Father!" "Your pride and reputation must have dispersed like ash in a strong breeze." "Father! Father! Father!" "You are insuperable heights who cannot be comprehended by everyone;" "And I am one among everyone." "Faulting you was my biggest mistake; Can you forgive your child, father?" "You are my pride." "You are my destination." "You are my journey." Forget about winning or losing. Just box to enjoy the game. That is when you are going to become the best boxer. That is when you will experience the high of the game. Come on, right left. Thank you so much for telling me the truth about my father, sir. For the past fifteen years, I believed in the same lies about my father like everyone else. Not once did I think that my father is innocent of all the blame. My father would always tell me to enjoy the game and compete. Where as I, I boxed with anger, hate and emotions, and brought myself to this situation. This year, I must somehow participate in IBL. And win the nationals. What are you talking, Ghani? You’ve already been banned from competing for an entire year. Anger, aggression, emotion…. Everyone has all those things within them. Players like Mohammad Ali, Mary Kom, Vijendra Singh have become winners by overcoming all these things. Now, all this is a waste. It’s too late. I can’t help you. All these days I boxed to prove myself to be different from my father. But now, I need to prove that my father isn’t such sort of a person. Sir, if you help, I can participate in IBL. Please, sir. Give me one last chance. You were a two-time champion, who stayed away from the sport for 15 years and have suddenly popped by and are now asking for a favor. How do you think I can say no to you? Boxing is an emotional game. He is a strong player. But he needs to have a good emotional balance as well. I believe you, Mr. Vijender. I am giving you my approval because I trust your judgement. Thank you. Ghani? -Sir. When you reached the finals of state level championship, you got into the IBL selections by default. Of course, there were problems because of the ban. But I have sorted it all out. You are part of the IBL now. Sir, thank you. -There’s very little time now. So, get started. Your innings starts now. Congratulations. Okay, sir. I will start right away. Sorry, mom. I spoke nonsense without knowing the entire truth about my father and hurt you. I don’t know if we are used to the pain or if pain got used to us. But it’s always been around us. To achieve dad’s goals, I need to win boxing. Mother, I got selected to the IBL. I am going to Delhi. Ghani. Your father did not lose the match. They made him lose the match. I don’t like you going there. I can understand your fear, mother. You are saying no because you are scared that the same thing that happened to dad would happen to me as well. If I don’t try after getting to know dad’s goals and vision, every moment of my life, I would be in constant agony. In the very boxing ring that my father lost... I should win there and proudly proclaim that I am Vikram Aditya’s son. I shall take my leave, mother. I will be back. You don’t lose when you are knocked down. You lose when you stay down. So, our focus should be on the opponent. The power should be in our fists. And when you hit, the injury should be a thousand-fold. Why didn’t it move? Do you understand? Do you get it? You’ve been hitting for the past ten days and it hasn’t moved. I didn’t hit it to make it move. I hit it so you could understand. I don’t know about all that. Give me back my money. Money? What money? -Once you give me the money, it’s as good as making an offering to your teacher. You should fear me that much at least. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? I didn’t teach you this punch, did I? -I saw it in YouTube. Apart from cooking, are they teaching boxing as well on YouTube? Even though he saw it on the YouTube, his right hook is… -Excuse me? Yes! What do you want? -I want to meet the coach. Telugu? How can I be of help? Mr. Vijender Sinha asked me to meet him. I don’t have work here at all. What can you do here? Idiot! -Sir. Is the room ready? -Ready, sir. Ghani. -Sir... Get ready. We are going to start your practice. Okay. Everyone here dreams of being a champion, just like you. But there is only one winner.

And especially to the boxers. Who are eagerly waiting for the IBL. Now the day has arrived today. With pleasure, we invite our sports minister to launch the logo of IBL. Please launch the logo sir. Now, I would like to call upon the most important person The man behind this idea. The person behind this revolution. The founder of this format. The strength of this IBL. Mr. Eshwar Nath to come up on stage. Welcome to everyone. Unlike every year, the boxing federation has changed the pattern of the game at nationals. Many people are wondering why they made this change. India is a great country. But so far, it was able to win only 10 gold medals in Olympics. Boxing hasn’t got even a single one of those medals. That is why Indian Boxing Federation has taken a step forward... and turned National Boxing Championship into Indian Boxing League. IBL. It has been my dream for the past 25 years. Earlier, there were no facilities available for those who wanted to learn boxing. There were no opportunities to box either. I have seen players who starved themselves just to get an opportunity to compete. And I’ve even seen players who’ve resorted to unethical practices to win. That is when I thought about it. Every player who wants to play must be given an opportunity. Every player who is capable and talented needs to be supported so that no one tries to sabotage them. That is IBL. IBL champion is a national champion. The champion of this league can participate in any league or championship in the world. But they will do that as someone who is representing India. In the future, India is going to be in a number one position when it comes to boxing. I say it with pride that India is going to win gold medal in Olympics. Dream boxing, breathe boxing, live boxing. IBL is with you. Thank you. Did you get angry when you saw Eswar? When I saw the man who put us in such a situation, I was so angry that I wanted to kill him. But, killing him is simply so easy. At the max, it can be delayed by a day. The next year, they are going to launch IBL on his name. My father trusted him and lost. You won and yet you lost. But he has become such a central figure in Indian boxing. My father wished for the success of the sport. If the sport has to succeed, I need to win. Because the society always believes the words of a winner. I will win, coach. I will win for sure. Like father! Like Son! Let's do it. Congratulations! You’ve knocked it out of the park, Eashwara. IBL is trending on FaceBook, Twitter and the entire media. The entire country is overcome by this IBL fever. But there is a small problem. The name of that problem is Advisory Board chairman, Irfan Khan. Yes. That very same man. Tell me, Eashwar. What else is there to say, Mr. Khan? If you give us the clearance, we can start the tournament. How can you start? It’s wrong to even make the announcement without the approval of the Advisory Committee. The government approved it and I made the announcement. What’s wrong with that? There is nothing wrong with the government approving. But it is wrong to make you in charge of this game. I am very clear on the intention behind this move. If you are that clear, why don’t you give me the clearance? If necessary, I will stop the IBL that has already been announced. But I will make sure what you want doesn’t come to pass. Thanks for the confirmation. If possible, let us meet again. Eswara! I am prepared to kill IBL and those who oppose my ideas Let's begin the game ♪Ring...Ring…Ring… ♪ ♪ come to the ring of destiny.♪ ♪The sport of your heart’s desire is boxing. ♪ ♪So, come on, you and me, let’s get the excitement going. ♪ ♪Make a fist with those ten fingers, bend them, bend them. ♪ ♪Let the adrenaline flows through you like a flood. ♪ ♪I wonder how powerful and sharp you are. ♪ ♪Let your punches show them. ♪ ♪There are so many who call themselves players♪ ♪Wonder how powerful each one of them is. ♪ ♪Count them up and win over them♪ ♪Come on, play. ♪ ♪The expectations riding on you touch the borders of the skies. ♪ Only your victory matters. ♪ ♪Give it your best and play♪ ♪No matter how strong your opponent is, ♪ ♪Just knock them out. ♪ ♪Take the trophy. ♪ ♪Only the one who wins becomes the king, isn’t it? ♪ What happened Ram Mohan? You asked me to invest 500 crores in a sport such as boxing that has absolutely no recognition. I trusted you and invested the amount. The sport is now recognized and even you made name. And the quarter finals players list is out as well. What about my money, Eashwara? When will I get it and how will I get it? Betting. Betting? Our people are so habituated to betting that – They gather around the tea stall and bet on the series number of the car that’s going to pass them by. And they even spend hundreds of crores gambling away on cock fights in Bhimavaram. They gamble thousands of crores on elections and hundred thousand crores in cricket. Our people need a situation to start gambling. Gambling is in the DNA of Indian people. This works with cricket, politics and cock-fights. How will this work with boxing? Hello, excuse me? Don’t take boxing lightly. There is a turnover of lakhs of crore of rupees on upcoming sports all over the world. Cricket accounts for only 20%. Just one boxing match in Las Vegas amounts to 300 to 400 million dollars in gambling. It’s far greater than the gambling in IPL matches. Oh goodness! Who is this, Eashwara? -Yousaf Ali Khan. One of the best betting experts in India. Right from MLA, MP elections to Cricket and Rummy betting, he is the one who handles all illegal betting. Yousuf will take care of things such as how to set the odds in IBL, fix matches and make sure the message reaches the people through social media. It’s all good that he will take care of it. What about the players? Shakuni won not because Dharmaraju didn’t know how to play the game. It’s because he knew the kind of numbers he needed to throw. I got it. You are the ones who will be running the show. Just as the Shakuni’s dice, you will be handling players in the same manner. Chaitanya... -Sir... arrange a party for all those who won the quarterfinals. Okay sir. Finally, after fifteen years. How are you, Vijendar? I am right here. But you…you reached somewhere else. You know what your problem is, Vijender? You know how to fight in the ring. But you don’t know how to win in life. Well, are you going to introduce me or… …are you going to keep hiding him? Vikram Aditya’s son. Ghani. Hey, champ! He would have told you everything about me as soon as he met you. And as soon as you found out, you should have come and surrendered. I would have done something to give you a leg up in your career. And if you didn’t come even after you knew things, you must have some other intention. This is not going to happen. I will not let that happen. Whether it is life or boxing there is no victory in surrendering. Victory comes with struggle Note it down. I am going to be the one who will win the tournament. There’s nothing wrong with thinking that. Since you are Vikram Aditya’s son, you will be motivated by revenge. Your youth will boost your ego. And you will nourish the hope that you will win. But, this is Eashwar Nath. I am the one in charge. I am the one who makes someone win or lose or even make them participate in the game. You don’t have it in you to face me. There is nothing wrong with underestimating me. Because you carry a 25-year sin in your life, your ego makes you think that you will win. And your arrogance will make you believe that you will not lose. In life, you can mess with a good man or a bad man. But you should never mess with a mad man like me who wishes to make the sport shine. Because you cannot take it. Vijender, did you teach him to box or mince words? I established my foundations in your father’s loss and got this far. You are just a kid. What can you do?! I can do as much damage as someone in this tournament can inflict upon you. You will be outside the ring and watch the match. But I will be in the boxing ring, playing the game. I will make sure that every victory of mine is going to make you start fearing. I will make sure you remember your sins. I will make sure you have no other option. Super! I was so used to winning that there was no more excitement in my life. Now, I am on a high. I like it. All the best, Champ. What happened here, Rishi? I think it’s a knock out. But we will have to confirm with the replays. Wow! Look at that... wah, what a punch? So, in the four quarterfinals that happened, three were according to our odds and equations. And we won close to 400 crores. But, the fourth quarterfinal, which was between Ghani and Sohail Khan, the odds and equations that we predicted for it, did not pan. In fact, it went in the opposite direction. We lost. How much did we lose? Approximately 100 crores. Hundred crores, Eashwer?! Sir, going forward, the stakes are going to be five to ten times higher. It’s semis and finals. Even one small mistake… If we lose even one match, the consequences will be unthinkable, sir. It looks like we are going to be in losses right off the bat. You must do something. Don't give the opponent a chance... You should... -Ghani... Sorry bro. I made a mistake. False ego. After I got to know the truth about your father, I realized how important this match is for you. I lost the match. But you must win. (Game commentary) Stop! Ghani, Are you okay? Are you okay? (Game commentary) Idiot... it's a foul. Referee, it's a foul. Give me that tray... faster. Relax Ghani! just focus on the game. Move... move... move (Game commentary) Stop, move back. Knock him off. Stop Wow! Ghani knocks out Kala Blunt force damage. Right now, nothing critical. But, if he goes to the same situation in the finals and injures himself in the ribs, his lungs and liver could be damaged and that could endanger his life. Hope you can understand. Okay. No, Ghani. The decision is in our hands. You don't worry. Next year, we can practice and try once again. IBL chairman, Mr. Eashwer Nath has proceeded to meet the IBL’s first finalist, Ghani. Let’s watch the live updates. What going on? Why is there no pride that you won the match? Neither can I see the pain because of your rib injury. That day, after the winning punch, you gave me a look. I didn’t like how you looked at me then. I was hurt. Eashwer Nath. Today my position, my power… The empire I’ve created for myself… This is all 25 years of hard work. How will I stay quiet when a 25-year-old kid comes along and says that he would turn into all into rubble? The investment I made in quarter finals for your defeat is a loss But I did make profit because of your success in semi-finals. Do you know what the bonus is? As you wanted, you came all the way to the finals. But you cannot win. Do you know why? Your opponent is Ivan... my monster. Trained in Russia. The wildest beast in the ring. Vijender. I killed his father because I knew that he was going to turn into a problem in the future. How will I let him go? Your player is very lucky, sir. If he had taken 10 milligrams more, he would have died. Can I give it to him now? What are you saying, sir? He will die! Can I tell you one thing... The doctor is going to say that you are fit. Media will come to the match and you will turn into a crowd favorite. You fighting the match, losing it and dying – all these things are going to happen for sure. But I will be the one deciding until which round you are going to play and until when. All the best, Champs. We lost our money because of him. Now, you are making back that money by betting on him. You are super, Eashwer. You made him believe that you are losing and the enemy is winning. Who else could do a better job of stabbing someone in the back? What’s up, Yousuf? Is everything set for the finals? Yes, sir. Everything is ready. The craze for this final is way beyond our expectations. But there is a small problem. The odds between the two players are equal, sir. That’s good, right? What’s the problem? If the odds are same for both the players, it wouldn’t bode well for us, sir. If the expectations on one player are high and low for another player, that is when we make a profit. Otherwise, it wouldn’t work, sir. Hello! I tried to convince Ghani .. but it didn't work. But he isn’t listening. That is why I called you. I don’t want another tragedy in the ring. That is why if you could talk to him… What is it, mother? Are you going to give me the same advice that others did? That I shouldn’t fight this match? You should fight this match, Ghani. Looking at you, I am reminded of your father. To realize his dream, he let go of all of his interests, his job… ….and finally, his life as well. Your father was such a man. But people around him kept pointing fingers at him like he was in the wrong. I wanted to shout and scream that Vikram isn’t that kind of a person. But… I don’t have any proof. But today, you are here. If I tell you not to fight, it is as good as killing his dream once again. You came this far despite the number of hurdles in your path. That can only mean that your father’s determination is very strong. Go. Turn your anger into speed, Put your pain into your punches. And believe in the game. Every punch you make, should be as if your father’s ambitions are being brought to life. We are right now at IBL finals. The two finalists, Ghani and Ivan. Ghani is from Andhra Pradesh and Ivan is from Haryana. Let’s see who is going to win the cup. Ivan is an aggressive player. His semi finals and quarterfinals were all knock outs. My favorite is Ivan. You know one thing, do you know who Ghani is? He is the son of Vikram Aditya who took steroids and play in finals fifteen years ago. Would he be able to erase that black mark with his victory? Thank you all. Finals begin in few minutes. Let's enjoy the game. The IBL final match will start in few minutes From the red corner we have Ivan. ( Game commentary ) That's it... That's it...That's it. ( Game commentary ) ( Game commentary ) Stop... stop. Come on... (Game commentary) (Game commentary) Back... Back. (Game commentary) Stop! Ghani try not to stay in yourselves Watch his moves. Move... move... move away. Stop! Come on Ghani, Come on... Coach... Cool... coo... just be cool Ghani. Ghani... -Ghani... Ghani... -No He does not rise. I will win, coach I must won You fighting the match, losing it and dying – all these things are going to happen for sure. your father’s ambitions are being brought to life. Are you ok? Move. Stop. Ghani! Ghani! We will quit the game. Whether dead or alive it is in the game only. I'll play. C'mon Ghani. Hit it hard. You can do it. Come... come. (Game commentary) We lost it. And Ghani has won by a knockout Ghani! I don’t know what you are going to do. If you don’t arrange for the money within 24 hours, you know better than me what’s going to happen. So, make it fast Eashwer. He is still so arrogant. This isn’t the right time. Let’s come back again to handle him. Let's go. Hey... Why can’t I see pride in your eyes? I can’t even see the sadness that comes from defeat either. I didn't like the way you treated us at the party that day. Now, you know the pain that feels like someone is squeezing your heart. We suffered that pain for fifteen years. Do you know something shocking? That Eswar will not let you win He met me after the match Bro, I need help from you. Anytime, bro. I’ll help you anyway I can. Do as he said Not everyone cheats like you. There is another breaking news for you. I am very happy that Ghani won the IBL. Ghani's father, Vikramaditya, was not a cheater. In fact, he was a genuine and a great boxer. That day, Eashwar Nath had deceived him into taking the drug in a drink. And killed him heartlessly. Do you have any proofs? I have a proof regarding his death. Vijender, I knew that his father would become a problem for me the in the future and so killed him. How do you think I’ll let him off easy? Are you feeling sad that the entire world knows the truth? Do you realize how much pain my father went through because of your betrayal? You keep talking about your power, your position and your 25-year-old empire… None of those things can save you now. Karma (Fate) Did you hear about it? It doesn’t spare anyone. It catches one’s pin code and comes to them. It came to you in the form of me. I know that you know how to handle this situation better than me. All the best. Let’s meet again if possible. Ghani, it’s time. Coach! Me? Sir... here. There is no time... please cut it fast. Come on. Ghani. We need to get ready for Olympics. What? In your coaching?? Yes!
