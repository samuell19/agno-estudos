After that, I knew it was gonna be a long summer. [newscaster 1]... at least 1,000 persons rioted in the Watts district last night. They attacked police with rocks, bricks, and bottles before some 100 officers sealed off.. [newscaster 2]... some 100 officers sealed off the four-block area in the vicinity of 116th Street and Avalon Boulevard. Four persons were arrested, and a number of others... [newscaster 1] ...including one policeman were injured in the melee. The riot was touched off' when three drunk drivers... - [helicopter whirring] - [police radio chatter] [sirens wailing] [officer] Yes, George, this is Arnold Miller, mobile unit three. We're right in the center of this group... [protesters chanting] - [whistle blows] - [overlapping newscaster chatter] [newscaster 3] The commander of the California National Guard said his troops sent into the riot area would use whatever force was necessary... [newscaster 4]... between police and residents of this primarily colored area. I'm just about a quarter of a block from Imperial and Avalon... [newscaster 5]... gunfire was heard Increasingly in the Negro section during the hot, smoggy evening as the police confronted roaming bands of rampaging Negroes. [newscaster 4] They are literally surrounded by an angry crowd of Negroes. Several hundred rioters. It is a mob scene, George. And they're throwing bottles, bricks, and anything else they can get their hands on, taunting the police with catcalls and obscenities. [man] When the riots stopped, the drugs started. [funk music playing over speakers] My father sold dope, and my mother was a heroin addict. Moms and Pops were real popular in the neighborhood. They would always be having parties for friends of theirs who just got out of jail, or who was on their way to jail. They only got married 'cause I was born. My pop sometimes worked as an electrician, or a cab driver, or a plumber, but his main job was selling drugs. Sometimes, Mom would use 'em all up before he could even sell 'em. Then, he'd have to beat her up. [man 2] You lookin' good like a mothafucka. Growing up with parents like that, I heard a lot and I saw a lot. I caught onto the criminal life real quick. Instead of keeping me out of trouble, they turned me on to it. [man 2] That mothafucka got some love up there too. - I think there were some tears of joy. - [laughter] For the goat. Well, you know, you give me the pig... [both laugh] What's up, Pernell? Clyde. Kaydee Caine. What you doin' out here? Stop callin' me that. Shut up. Little ol' nigga. This party here for grown folks.

Boy, you better get yo little ass in that room 'fore yo daddy catch you! You hear me talkin' to you? Now! What the hell are you... [Caine] Pernell looked out for me when things got rough.

[police radio chatter] [helicopter whirring] Whatever you decide to do, remember what we learned. And for those of you who are coming back, I'll see you next year. [Caine] For all the bullshit they try to teach you in high school, I graduated with about half of it. But then, I didn't go to school but half the time. The other half, I was out sellin' dope. Growing up out here, there was shit that couldn't be learned in no classroom. - I just want to say... - [pager beeps] - [student 1] Yo, what's up? Is that me? - [student 2] Is that me? [school bell rings] Yo. What the hell you doin'? Tryin' to ride this ol' raggedy thing. [laughs] You must want a new Big Wheel. Yeah, 'cause this old Big Wheel doesn't work right. [Caine] Look, I'm gonna buy you a new one, okay? Okay. - [Caine] All right? - All right. - [Caine] Hi. - 'Sup, little man? Hey, Caine. [Caine] 'Sup? Caine's gonna buy me a new Big Wheel, Mama. Oh, is he? You know you don't have to keep buyin' him stuff. Oh, it ain't no thang. This is my partner, right there. - Ain't that right, little man? - [Anthony] Yep. [laughs] So you finally did it, huh? Yep. Finally done. All right. [Laughs] Aw, man, congratulations. Hey, come on. Let's make it in the house. [Caine] Ronnie was Pernell's girl before he went to the pen. Anthony came right after that. Pernell had hooked up a house and a little money for em. But I still went by to check on 'em. - [helicopter passing overhead] - [people chattering] [hip-hop playing on car stereo] [sirens wailing in distance] [Caine] My pops was killed In a drug deal when I was fen. And my moms was too strung out. So I went to live with my grandparents in Jordan Downs. [pager beeps] It was only supposed to be temporary. But my moms died from an overdose, so I just stayed. Hey, Grandma. [laughs] Me and your grandpa are so proud of you, Caine. Thomas, come on out of that room. Come on down here and say hello to our grandson. The Lord's grace is with you, boy. And I want to let you know that next week, when you get that diploma, I'll be the proudest grandfather in all of LA. And I know if your mama and papa were still alive, they'd be proud of you too.

And don't be actin' like no pussy when we get the fuck out there. [man] Hey, Dee. You want to go to my house? My moms made a big-ass pot of chili there. [Junior] Let's rush some chili. We don't need no mothafuckin' hot dog. [Dee] That's where y'all need to be, in the goddamn house. You got a curfew. [Junior] Why don't you get us some mothafuckin' work or somethin', stupid ass bitch! Fuck you, nigga. It's time for both y'all to go, okay? - Let's go. - Let's go to yo mom's house, nigga. - We don't need this shit. - That's what I'm sayin'. Go home to your mammies, okay? Yeah, nigga, break up. - [Dee screams] - Fool! Break up, mothafucka! [screaming continues] [O-Dog] Bitch, shut the fuck up, before we blast yo ass too! Shut the fuck up. Hey, homey, you need some help? Punk-ass nigga. Come on, niggas. [train whistle blows] [tires squealing] [Caine] I thought killin' those fools would make me feel good. But it really didn't make me feel anything. I just knew that I could kill somebody. [And if] had to, I could do it again. [dog barking] - 'Sup, Caine. How you doin' today? - [Caine] 'Sup? I'm all right. That's good. I'm tired. I'm in there studying. - You want something to eat? - No, I'm straight. Okay. Have a seat. [Caine sighs] Where's Anthony? Um, he's in the back takin' a nap. He should be up in a second, actually. - Hey, can I use your bathroom? - Mm-hmm. You know where it is. Shit. I got some money this time, man. I got two dollars. You ain't got no mothafuckin' money, nigga. Where that mothafuckin' 20 at? Nigga, come with the 20, nigga. You owe me a dub from last week. Oh, nigga. Much as I buy from you, you gonna trip about that? Come on, man. Here you go, man. I got two dollars for you, man. I know I'm a little short, but uh... That's not mothafuckin' cool, nigga. Come with 20, nigga. - Come with 20. - I ain't got nothin'. - Come on, man. - Give that nigga his money back. Give me my two dollars back, at least, man. Give me my two... I'm gonna go buy a cheeseburger, man. Let me go buy a burger, then. - Caine? - What's up? Wanna play me at boxin'? [laughs] What you think? I'll whoop your ass! Anthony, what did I tell you about your mouth? What? Why you trippin'? What do you mean, why am I trippin"? Because he's five years old, and he has no business talkin' like that. Well, you gotta be hard growin' up out here. Caine, that has nothin' to do with being hard, okay? Because he gets that crap from you, Dog, and that fool, Stacy. Well, Pernell showed me what's up. And? Is that somethin' to be proud of? And speakin' of his father, I got a letter from him today. He asked about you. - For real? What's he up to? - Nothin'. Liftin' and tryin' to read every book in the library. When I'm done in here I'll get you your letter. All right. Cool. Look, I'm gonna be in the room whoopin' your son's ass in this game. I mean... [chuckles] We're goin' to box and shit. Uh, I mean, you know, a little somethin'. Come on, Ant. Let's just... Come on. [Anthony] I'm gonna beat your butt. [A-Wax] I'm outta here. Go on somewhere! Damn! Oh, look, man. I made these cheeseburgers, man. [O-Dog] What's with your mothafuckin" teeth? Hey, man, that's from all that cheese I been eatin'. - Hey, you want one of these burgers? - No. Get the fuck out of here, man. - You stink. - Oh, shit! One time! [all shouting] [siren chirps] [O-Dog] Move, man! Move! Move! - [engine revs] - [siren chirps] [tires squealing] [video game sounds] [bell dings] Hold up. Now, I'm gonna wear you out, you little punk. Let me see that. The gun! All right. Where'd I put that letter? Is this it? Yep. [scoffs] Now, see, you hold it like this, and pull the trigger. - [gun clicks] - Pow, punk-ass. Look, it ain't loaded! What the hell are you doin'? I don't want my son learnin' to pull drive-bys. Look, I was just showin' him how to shoot! Yeah, Mama. Anthony, get over here. Get over here! - Let me tell you something. - [grunts] If I ever catch you with a gun in yo hand, I will break your tail. You got that? Get outta here! Get up and get out! And how many times do I have to tell you to stop givin' us money? Look, don't give me that shit, okay? 'Cause I don't see nobody with no fuckin' job around here, all right? You know what? I don't need your money. [sighs] Look, Pernell looked out for me, okay? If it wasn't for him - no, listen! No, listen. If it wasn't for him, my Black ass would be dead by now. - I'm just payin' him back. - You know what? Fuck Pernell! "Cause you don't owe him shit! All right? You need to be glad that you graduated from high school. And that you alive at 18. And you need to do somethin' with yourself before you end up like he did. Look, I'm not gonna end up like he did, all right? Oh, really? Yo, why you trippin'? I mean, you act like you never was down. What's up with that? Caine, it's not even about bein' down. All right? I got a little son to look after. And you know what's really sad? Is that I look at you, and you remind me of how Pernell used to be. [sighs] Yeah, and? - Yeah, and what? - [pager beeps] Look at you. I gotta go, all right? Here. [sighs] Cool. [sighs] - [phone rings] - [O-Dog] This is the good part. [clears throat] Jeah? [Caine] What's up, nigga? What's poppin'? [A-Wax] What up? Ain't nothin'. Hold on. - Who dat? - Cocaine. - Hey, nigga, where you at? - [Caine] What's up, man? I been tryin' to page you all day. [Caine] Come on, man. I know. Who there? Me, Wax, Lew-Loc, and that mothafuckin' faggot-ass, Chauncy. - [Caine] So what's up, man? - Yeah. - We gonna roll or what? - Oh, so you down to roll tonight? - [Caine] Oh, iris on. - All right, bet. [knocking on door] Turn this shit off, man. - Wake that fool up to answer the door. - Yo, man, what's up? Man, get yo bitch-ass up and answer the door. - [knocking continues] - Fuck you, nigga.

Why you come through this mothafucka so early all the time, man? - You said one o'clock. - I don't give a fuck what I said, nigga. I don't get out of bed 'fore 2:30. Don't come through this mothafucka so early next time, nigga. Understood. See what you got. This mothafucka here. Black Nissan Maxima. - Yeah. - 1990. It's gotta look exactly the same, okay? -They don't - -Yeah, cool, cool, cool. - Yo, Wax? - [A-Wax] Jeah? - Yo, nigga. - [A-Wax] What? Let me get some links with them grits, man. Hurry up. I'm hungrier than a mothafucka out here! - [A-Wax shouting] - Go ahead, nigga. It's got to be in excellent running condition, too, all right? Insurance company ain't gonna give you no money for a car that doesn't run. - Can you hang with this? - [dog barks] Yeah, I'll hook you up. All right. Be here tomorrow night. 'Bout, uh... 'Bout 10:30. I'm sorry, did - Are you sure you mean tomorrow night? Do, do, do I stutter, mothafucka? No, no problem. Tomorrow night. That's fine. - Did I stutter, mothafucka? - No, you're right. What, you scared to come through this neighborhood at night, mothafucka? - Huh? - No. No problem. You ain't too scared to have the Black man steal for yo funky ass, is you? - You're right. - Man, get the fuck outta here. - Okay, thanks. Thanks. - Take off. Don't bring yo narrow ass over here no more. Go on back into Westwood where you belong. Hope you find your way down Compton Avenue, mothafucka. [A-Wax] Man, get yo mothafuckin' heads down. Tell me all that bullshit, nigga. Be at the mothafuckin' crib gettin' blunted and shit. Wait. One more, one more, one more. I'm sure the shit's down here somewhere. Bingo. - Jeah. - That mothafucka right there? - Yeah, that's it. - Right there. Oh, shit. Look at the mothafuckin' wheels. Hell, yeah.

Nigga, you - Come on, man. - Got it. - You got it? - Yeah. - [alarm blaring] Damn, man. Come on! Get in! Damn! Where the screwdriver at? No, no, no. The screwdriver. [alarm beeps] [tires squealing] [sirens wailing] [Caine] Shit, let's get the fuck up outta here! - [officer 1] Hold it right there! - [officer 2] Freeze! Let's go! Okay, let him go. Let's go. All right, guys. Let's go! Follow him down. [barking, snarling] - [Caine] Aw, shit! - [O-Dog] Hey, man, it's a dog. - [Caine screams] - Hey, get the fuck off! - Get off me! - Get the fuck off! - [screaming continues] - Come get y'all's dog off! - [Caine shouts] - Come get this mothafuckin' dog! - Hey, get this dog off my homey here! - [dog snarling] - [Caine] Get off me! - [O-Dog] Hey, come get this dog! [Caine] Since it was my first offense, well, actually, the first time I ever been caught for anything, the judge reduced my crime from grand theft auto to attempted joyriding. They let O-Dog off with a warning cause he was still a minor. My dad had been to jail before, Pernell went to jail, I mean, even O-Dog had been to youth camp. But I didn't care what any of "em said. It was no place I could get used to. Mothafucka, you don't know me, nigga. Man, you got some money or not? No, man. Come on, man. - Just hook me up this time? Man. - Nigga, you crazy? Hook you up? Get the fuck outta here, man. Check this out, I got these burgers, man. - They some double cheeseburgers. - Nigga, I just ate. - Come on. Have 'em, man. - I just ate, fool. I don't want no mothafuckin' cheeseburger. If you ain't got no money, you just assed out. Call this mothafucka. Yo, Dog! Hurry up! - Fuck, man. - Come on, man. Wait! Wait, wait, wait, man. Man, man, I suck yo dick. - Come on, man. Just hook me up. - What the fuck you just say, nigga? Man, I said I suck yo dick. Come on, man. Just get me -. - Man, fuck you. - [gunshot] Damn. Suck on that, you bitch-ass trick. O-Dog, what the fuck you doin'? - [woman] Yo, Dog! Hurry up! - [dog barking] Any of y'all want a hamburger? What's wrong? What, you don't want no hamburger? I don't want no mothafuckin' hamburger. - You crazy. - [O-Dog] Even if it got cheese on it? - Man, you stupid, man. - I got it from that basehead. You stupid. [Caine] I didn't even have a record. But when they fingerprinted me, the cops matched my prints to the ones from that bottle I dropped in that liquor store the night of the robbery. [tape recorder clicks] [detective] Now, listen to me, you little bitch. I'm gonna ask you some real simple questions, and I want some real simple answers. You understand? Let me get this right. You bought the bottle of beer about 11:15? I bought the beer, and I accidentally dropped it. [detective] You bought the bottle of beer at 11:15. At-Yeah. At 11:15, I -Yeah. 11:15. Then, why wasn't the bottle cleaned up? Why did we find it still... there, spilled on the floor after the shoot? When I was - After we was leaving, after I left, um, other people's was coming in when we was leaving. [detective] But you don't remember what they... [Caine] What they looked like. I -. But you bought the bottle of beer definitely at 12:15? Yeah, it was 12:15, exact. - If I'm not mistaken. That's when it was. - [detective] Now, you see somethin'? Now, you see. Now, you done fucked up. You know that, don't you? -I said - -See what I'm sayin'? -No, I thought - -That's what, you know what I'm sayin'? You done fucked up, now. You know that, don't you? [detective laughs] [Caine] The more questions that cop asked, the more I thought I wasn't gonna never see daylight again. This time you said you bought the bottle of beer... [Caine] I was just waiting for them to tell me they seen that damn videotape, but they hadn't'. -Yeah, I - -You know you done fucked up, don't you? - I... - You know that, don't you? [laughs] You know you done fucked up? [Caine] Without the tape, they had nothing. [cell door slams] [Caine coughing, gagging] - [Stacy] What's wrong with my brotha? - [Sharif] Damn, boy. He's sick as a dog. Look at him. Yo, Caine, man. It's Stacy and Sharif. You all right, man? Hell, no. I ain't shit in a week. Goddamn. In a week! Come on, brotha. You wasn't there long enough to catch the HIV. [coughs] Fuck you. What you fools want, anyway? [Stacy] You still want me to take you to get this car, or what? [coughs] Yeah, hold on.

Hey, man, is that yo pops over there, man? - What? - Yeah, that's him. Hey, how's it going goin', men? You know, I smelled that barbecue. Y'all know I ain't passin' up on a barbecue. - Oh, we heard that. - Hell yeah. - Pops wanna get his eat on. - Let me sit down here. Now, now, I know there's some food left, right? - Hey, hey, Kiesha! - [Kiesha] Huh? - Kiesha! - [Kiesha] What, nigga? - Bring Mr. Butler a plate. - A nice sized plate, Kiesha. Anyway, Pops, I'm glad you come, 'cause I was talkin' to my brothers here about drugs and the community. And I always seem to be outnumbered. So you know, I just want to know your opinion of it. Well, as I see Kevin tryin' to hide that reefer, you know... It's okay to smoke it. I used to smoke a little reefer myself one time, when I was much younger. [Stacy] Bet you ain't never smoked the chronic, though. [laughing] [Mr. Butler] I don't know nothin' 'bout the chronic. They're not doin' nothin' but destroyin' their minds. Fallin' right into the devil's plan. That's all they doin'. [O-Dog] What the hell is the devil's plan? [Sharif] This is the devil's plan, right there. - That's the devil's plan. - Hey, man, don't throw it on me! - [A-Wax] Hey, man, don't be doin' that. - [Stacy] Throwin' my mothafuckin' joint. Hey, 'Rif, man, why you always trippin', man? - I know. Calm your boy down. - I mean, you got a father, man. [Sharif] And you got a grandmother and a grandfather. And I'm pretty sure they tell you everything that my father tells me, but you don't listen anyway, so what's the difference? [Stacy] No, no, man. Hold on. Mr. Butler, man. [Laughs] I'm just curious to know what's up about that, you know? Sharif be comin' at us every day! You know what I mean... - [O-Dog] Straight up, man. Damn. - Why does he act like this? I mean, what are y'all talkin' about at home? [Mr. Butler] Sharif's a good guy. That girl a little slow on that plate, ain't she? - [O-Dog] Hey, Kiesha! - Hey, girl, hurry up! - Shit. - [O-Dog] Bring the mothafuckin" plate! Excuse my language. [Sharif] Why do you think that's so funny? Because it is. You know, I can see it now. You're gonna go up there, and mess around, and bring back one of your "devils" to my house. Wait. Wait. You know I'm not bringing no devil to the house. [laughs] Oh, I see you checking out them white girls. You know how I feel about my Black women. Why you gonna throw that on me? I ought to take you outside and knock you out. Right now. Oh, ho, ho, hey, hey, hey. I brought you in, I'll take you out. Yeah, okay. [chuckles] [Sharif] What's up, Caine? It took you long enough, my brother. - Anyway. - Hey, Kaydee. You know, so what's up, young buck? - Man, I'm all right. - Yeah? - Hey, how's work? - Well, you know, white man always on your back, but what else is new, huh? - [sighs] - Have a seat. - What's up, man? - What's up, man. So what y'all talkin' about? Not much, just chattin' and -. Yeah, we're talkin' about this Kansas trip. Kansas? So what about Kansas? So what are you gonna do, Kaydee? You gonna fuck around out there in the streets till you get killed? Like your cousin, maybe? What's that, sir? Well, Sharif tells me him and Stacy have been tryin' to get you to leave with 'em. [sighs] Yeah, but... I don't know about no Kansas. Yeah, yeah. You know, I hear you there, you know? I was teasin' Sharif about that before you came in. But what are you gonna do if you stay? You know, Sharif used to get into all kinds of shit, before he found the Nation. Now, and I'm no Muslim. But I agree with some of the things they say regarding Black people. And if Allah helps to make him a better man than Jesus can, then I'm all for it. So what you tryin' to say, Mr. Butler? Whatever changes you have to make... then you just do it. You gotta think about your life. [siren wailing in distance] Being a Black man in America isn't easy. The hunt is on... and you're the prey. All I'm sayin' is... all I'm sayin' is... survive. All right? [Caine] Mr. Butler had me thinkin, cause he was the only one who ever came at me like he gave a damn. Grandpops always kicked that religion stuff, and my dad never said anything. Pernell showed me how to survive on the streets, but Mr. Butler was talkin' about survivin' for good. So how did it go between you and that girl you met at the barbecue? Are you talkin' about the baby in the black shorts? - Yeah. - Yeah, I fucked her. I did, fool. Yeah, well, I hope you wore a hat, 'cause I know a couple of brothers that done eased up in there. Come on, now, don't even play me like that. You know I'm packin' the plastic. Shit, I ain't going out like Willy Lump-Lump. Well, if you don't pack the plastic, you definitely goin' out. I don't know if it's like Willy Lump-Lump, but whoever that is. Who is Willy Lump-Lump? Oh, a little inside thing. It ain't nothin'. It ain't nothin'. Growing up in the hood, we were used to gettin' sweated by the cops. I mean, they would follow us in the car, then turn away. I mean, they'd stop us for no reason and question us. Especially with a car like mine. A 5.0 and Daytons? I knew we was in for it. Put your hands on the hood and spread your legs. Hey, man, this mothafuckin' hood is hot. Are your hands burning? I thought all you boys liked barbecue. Go get somebody's cat out of a tree. - Shut up! - You got a smart-ass mouth. You know that? - Get on there! - Start reading me my rights or something. - Sit down and shut up! - Why don't you just read me my rights? I mean, my taxes are up to date, man. I got registration. - Well, that's enough. Come on. - Read me my rights! - Shut the fuck up. - Just because I'm a Black man, that's why. - 'Cause I'm a Black man. - I got rights. I'll beat your mothafuckin' ass. -Listen, that's why - -Shut the fuck up! Get the fuck in the car. Both of you guys. Come on! Ah, shit! This thing hurts. What the fuck you doin'? [all shouting] Stop fucking moving! - Stop! Y'all just racist! - Ah, shit! Shut the fuck up. I told you to stop fucking moving. Hey, get me the wire cutters, ese. Fuck you, homes. I ain't doin' this shit no more. Hey, homes, so what are you gonna do? Are you gonna go with me or what? You take care of it, huh? Hey, what's your fuckin' problem, man? [grunts, groans] - All right. That's cool, homes. - You take care of it, eh? But don't forget. All right, homes? [Caine coughing] Hey, check it out, homes. What's up, man? Where, homes? Right over there. Let's move on 'em, ese. [chattering] [Caine] That night, the cops let us have. They dropped us off in the wrong hood where the eses slay. I guess they was thinkin' we would get our ass kicked even more. The eses was cool, though. They took us to the hospital. You know you could read this yourself. I know, but I like it when you read it. Okay. Mom, why'd the police beat up Caine and Sharif? Did they do somethin' bad? No, I don't think they did. Um... I think it was a big mistake. You know? Just a big mistake. Like the same kind of mistake that happened to Daddy? Oh. [Clears throat] No, what happened to Daddy was somethin' different. You know, with Caine... [sighs] Well, see, you have a certain group of people that don't like another group of people for whatever reasons. And the police didn't like Caine and Sharif very much. My friend Michael says the police hate Black people. No, no, no. That's not true. That's not true at all. Some of us -. Mom, is Caine gonna die? No. Caine's not gonna die. Caine's gonna be just fine. Okay? So don't worry about it. He'll be fine. You look so mean. Why don't you smile for a change. I ain't got shit to smile about. You alive, ain't you? [scoffs] Yeah, and who says that's good? Well, guess what? I got a job. - For real? - Yep, sure did. My aunt hooked it up for me. Makin' decent money, too. It's about 24 a year. What the fuck you gonna be doin'? I'm gonna be doin' office stuff. Thank you very much. You know, filin', typin', - answerin' the phone, gettin' coffee. - Hey, that's cool. That's cool. [Groans] Stuff like... like that. Caine. The job is in Atlanta. [toilet flushes] Caine! Did you hear me? I said the job is in Atlanta. Hey, take it. I mean, you might as well get the hell away from here. Well... to be honest... - you know what I was hopin'? - [groans] I was hopin' that maybe you would come with me. Came with you? Yeah. I mean, you ain't doin' jack-shit here. And the way that I see it, you'll be dead, or you'll be in jail. I mean, I don't know. I don't see it as such a bad idea. Why you so worried about me? Why shouldn't I be? Think about leaving, Caine. [Caine] I got to thinking about all the things I done on the streets. And all the things I probably would end up doing if I stay. I mean, being on the streets was coo, but I cared about Ronnie. And well, Anthony. He reminded me of me when I was little. And I didn't want him to grow up and go through what I've been through. It was all so crazy. I mean, things was starting to look different to me. It was the end of the summer. Ronnie had a little goin' away party. She and Anthony were gettin' ready to move to Atlanta. And Stacy and Sharif were gettin' ready to leave for Kansas. Why you drinkin' up all the beer? [scoffs] Go ahead on with that. Uh, could you please save some beer for somebody else? Oh, who, like Caine? 'Cause when that mothafucka come over here -. See, Caine. That's the key word, nigga. You ain't Caine. Stop drinkin' up all the beer! You're all on his nut sack. - Hey y'all. - [Stacy] 'Sup? I'm gon' go ahead and get in this game, take some of y'all money. Man, why don't you go take yo butt over there and try to talk to a girl for a change. Why don't you go and wash yo feet, stinkin' ass. Kiss my ass, mothafucka. You got one, mothafucka. Hey. [Sharif] Look, like I was sayin', how can we say that we equal to the white man when we gotta go to them for jobs? Oh, cut that bullshit. Hey, get up. Get up. - You're in my seat. - Kevin. - I was talkin' to the young lady. - She don't want to hear that shit. - Like I was sayin', we're not equal... - [knocking on door] ...until we have the same amount - of jobs they do. - [Caine] Who is it? [Chauncy] Five-O, nigga. Five-O. I'm sellin' encyclopedias, mothafucka. Oh, y'all bought jokes. [Chauncy] What up? What up? What up? [A-Wax] It's the Wax in the house! - [woman] Hey. - And the hood rat's in the house. Hood rats? Don't start that hood rat shit. You know ain't nobody no mothafuckin' hood rat. Don't let me break on yo ass. Hey, where's Ronnie's fine ass at in this mothafucka? - You can break somethin' on me. - Yo, baby! - Yo, yo, yo, what up? - What up? What up? What up? Man, give me a shot. Stacy, how many times I gotta tell you, don't smoke that crap in the house when Anthony's home? - Goddamn, Ronnie, what you talkin' about? - You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. Go take that shit outside. - You take it now, please. Now! - Y'all want to go outside with me, man? [video game sounds] Hey, little man. What you doin'? Just playin' games. You know, if you need anything, I'm right in the next room. I'm thirsty. Can I have some beer? Beer? No. You may have some juice. Beer. [Scoffs] Hey, this for the homeys who ain't here. My mothafuckin" cousin, Harold. Hey, 'Rif, why don't you go ahead and get a little hit of this? - Ah! - Sorry, Kevin. Aw, man. You a little punk, man. [Anthony] Y'all what's up? Boy, you better get yo butt back in that house before yo mama come out here and try to kill us all. - Hey, Ant, what you doin' out here? - Just kickin' it. Yo, let me have a drink. -[coughs] No way. I don't wanna see you - -Hey, no, man. No. Aw, man, give the little nigga somethin' to drink. What's wrong with you, Kevin? Don't be givin' this little kid no liquor. - You ain't his daddy. - You're not either, Kevin. Anthony, what are you doin' out here? You know better. Come on. Let's make it. Get in the house. And, uh, Caine, can I speak to you for a second? It's about to rain out here. [Stacy] Pussy-whipped. She got that nigga some panties, man. [laughs] Take your juice and go to your room. Go on, boy. What up, baby? What up? What up? What up? What up? How you doin'? - I'm fine. - Come here, come here, come here. - Why? - Let me hold you and shit. Chauncy. Chill out, nigga. Aw, nigga, I'm just jokin', man. You know you my nigga, Caine. - All right, buddy. - Yo, Ronnie. I'm gonna catch you later, though. Caine, me and you, baby. Cock-blockin' mothafucka. Why haven't I heard from you? I been busy. Well, have you at least thought about what we talked about? Yeah, about leavin' with you? Yeah, I thought about it. Why are you trippin'? You ain't doin' jack-shit here. Caine, why don't you just come with me? Ain't nothin' gonna change in Atlanta. I mean, I'm still gonna be Black. Just another nigga from the ghetto. Why do you say stupid shit like that? Because it's true. I mean, you act like Atlanta ain't in America. They don't give a fuck. You know what? [sighs] You know what Anthony asked me the other night? He asked me if you were gonna die. If you were gonna die, Caine. Are you gonna come with us or not? Yeah, I'm gonna go. Hey. Hey, uh, that's not cool, all right?

Man, I didn't want to see you caged in like some fuckin' animal. Is that what you think? I'm an animal? No, man. When I was growin' up... you was like my dad, man.

"Cast out the scorner and the contention shall go out, yea, strife and reproach shall cease." So what you tryin' to say, Grandpa? Son, you got to go. I don't want you to remain in our house another night. What y'all - What y'all want me to do? I want you out of here tonight. We're sorry, Caine. Y'all not too sorry. I mean, y'all kickin' me out. I've done all I can do for you. We tried our best to raise you. But you're bad. I wasn't gonna tell y'all till later. But in a couple of weeks, I'm gonna be movin' to Atlanta with Ronnie. I mean, can I just stay until then? I hope you're not gonna mess up that girl's life, Caine. -Grandma, I'm not gonna - -[Grandpa] Caine! Now, I sincerely hope you get your life together. Lord knows, I do. But I cannot have you in my home one more night. Grandma? Fine. The same day I was leavin, O-Dog had told me that the cops was lookin' for us over that liquor store robbery. He didn't care, though. He just hid out with different homeys each night. Doc dropped a dime on Chauncy's punk ass. O-Dog was gonna kill him if he didn't get caught by the cops first. [O-Dog] Man, I ain't gon' nowhere, man. Man, you gonna be a silly mothafucka if you leave with this broad, man. Straight up. I ain't bullshittin'. [Stacy] Man, which one you gonna take? Here you take it. Goddamn! Shit, Ronnie. Just you and Ant movin' or you takin' the whole fuckin' house with you? [laughs] Can you just take the box to the car? Thank you. - What's this for? - So you can take it to the car. I don't know why y'all want me to help y'all move. I ain't the one leavin'. - [Ronnie clears throat] - Sell out mothafucka. [door slams] What seems to be your problem? I was just thinkin' about... sayin' goodbye to my grandparents. You haven't talked to them yet? Well, if you want to, we can stop by there before we go. But can you take some of these bags to the car, please? You keep bossin' me around, I ain't goin' nowhere. You ain't goin' where? - [horn honks] - [man 1] Hey, coz, you better come on. Look, I just don't want you to go out and do something crazy. Don't worry about shit. I'm gonna handle this nigga for you. -Just - -Yo, I got to handle my business. [man 2] Stupid ass. Quit lookin' off. Nigga, just get in the car. Yo, what's up, homeys? Hey, let's go twist this nigga's cap back, man. [man 2] Let's go. Let's do this! [tires squealing] -[O-Dog] Man, you - -[Stacy] Come on, Dog. [Sharif] Man, would you brothers stop arguing? [O-Dog] I ain't gettin' paid for this shit. Nobody's gettin' paid, Kevin. [O-Dog] This nigga got a gang of shit in here. Shit. - [Sharif] Kevin, stop arguin'. - Shit, man. He always bitchin'. [O-Dog] What's all that shit in here for? [cousin] Yo, man, fuck that.

[screams] Wait! Oh, shit. [Stacy] O-Dog, get some fuckin' help, nigga. [sobbing] Oh, my God. Caine. - Come on. - Get Anthony. Get him outta here. Go get some fuckin' help, nigga. Shit! What's wrong with this nigga, man? Get some fuckin' help! Not my niggas. No, no. You'll be all right, man. You'll be all right. Get some fuckin' help! Shit! Get the fuck outta here! - [heartbeat continues] - Not my nigga... Ah, shit. Okay. Come on. You're okay... I'm with you now. Come on. Come on. Fight. Fight. Come on. No. You're just fuckin' me up here, Caine. Come on, baby. [Caine] After stompin' Ilena's cousin like that, I knew I was gonna have to deal with that fool someday. But damn, I never thought he'd come back like this. Blastin' Like I said, it was funny like that in the hood, sometimes. I mean, you never knew what was gonna happen. Or when. I had done foo much to turn back. And I'd done foo much to go on. [heartbeat slowing] I guess, in the end, it all catches up with you. My grandpa asked me one time, if I care whether I live or die. Yeah, I do. Now, it's foo late.
