[music playing] RACHEL: Niall, please. Can't you show just a little bit of understanding? Of Compassion? They had a free bar. I drank too much. Way more than what I'm used to. I just didn't know what I was doing. I made a mistake. One crazy drunken mistake. I apologize. I'm sorry. So very sorry. Can't you see? I made a mistake. For God's sake, I'm only human. Can't you forgive one stupid, stupid mistake? NIALL: No. No, I can't. Now fuck off! [alarm sounding] [alarm sounding] [niall signs] Are we happy? Did you say something? Oh, nothing. Come on. It's time to get up. The traffic's going to be mental. Just 10 minutes. I hate this shit. Are we going to be stuck in traffic like this until we're 65? Afraid so. Unless you win the lotto. And you haven't played in ages. [yawn] Wake me up when we get there. See you later. Remember to be back early the wedding planner's coming. Yeah. How could I forget? Bye. See you. Great. [alarm sounding] [kettle whistling] Hi, can you put me through to someone at home loans, please? There's no one in yet? OK. Can you get them to call me back ASAP? Yeah, it's Rachel Smith. They have my number already. Yeah. Look, it's urgent. There's a problem with my mortgage application. If I don't get it sorted today, I'll lose the property. Right. Thanks. How's it going, Rachel? Getting there. How was your weekend? It was shit. How was yours? Ah, wasn't too bad, I guess. Why was it shit? Don't wanna talk about it. OK. Fair enough. -Morning, Martin. -Rachel. Can I talk to you about my pay review? Reviews aren't until next week. Can't we do it today? But can't it wait? No, actually, it can't. You have to do mine today. Today? As a favor, Martin, please. I'm trying to get a mortgage for my apartment today. I need a statement of earnings. Maybe this afternoon. It has to be before lunch. I wouldn't push it unless it was important. All right. We'll sort something out. Thanks. Morning. RACHEL: Morning, Frank. Morning. How was the weekend? Marvellous. How are you getting on that cold? Grand, you know. Did you get the XML working? Nearly there, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there never won the race. Have it done for tomorrow? Sure, yeah. What's holding Tony up? Oh! Oh. Oh, fuck me. That was good. That was lovely. Ah. It's late. Mobile said you're [inaudible]. Yeah, I've gotta work, too. Bollocks. I hate working for a living. Well, you aren't doing too bad, are you? Well, I can't complain. Worst of all is we should have to go. So, Fiona, can I offer you a lift? My name's not Fiona. It's Claire. Course it is. I knew that. Spot of a deliberate mistake. Whatever. Ah, Come on. I've just been brain dead this morning. What, don't be like that, Claire. I'm sorry. It's a simple mistake. I think I'm the one who made the mistake. So, Tony, are you sleeping with so many women that you can't even remember their names? I'd say you need a secretary to keep track of them. Ah, come on, give me a break. So who's Fiona, then? Is that who you were seeing on Saturday night? Is that who rang you last night when you ran out to take the call? Ah, so it was. And that's why you couldn't see me, you bastard! Fuck this, on a Monday morning. Look, I'm just not thinking straight. Yeah, well, neither was I to come back here with a fucking low life like you. Well, that's told me. I just hope I didn't catch anything. There she goes. CLAIRE: (ANGRILY) See you around! Yeah, yeah. CLAIRE: (ANGRILY) Hey, Tony, there's a letter for you. Maybe it's from Fiona. You tosser! I'm really sorry, I'm late. You know we're under pressure. I know, my dad was sick all weekend. Had to stay over with him, help him get up this morning. Get him dressed, all that stuff. Is he all right? Yeah, I think so. Another day, another dollar. So, Eoiny boy, what did you get up to this weekend? Spent time with some wedding stuff, you know. What kinda wedding stuff? [polite chatting] Here we are. Wow. You know, we can cater for up to 200 people in this function room. Wow, it's enormous. One of the biggest ones in the city, actually. And, um, what about the catering? Well, we offer four different menu options to suit your taste and budget. Excellent. How many people are you expecting? Well we're trying to keep it under 250, but that's going to be difficult. Well, we can easily cater for party of that size, and any extra numbers will be no problem, at all. Oh, god. 250 people! Think of it, Eoin. This room will be full of 250 people just for us. Yeah, I can't stop thinking about it. Um, I just ask you question. You know, what price is this per head, per person? Our basic menu starts at 100 euro per head, and upwards from there. That's 25,000, right? I'll give you a few moments to consider it all. Thank you. It's 25,000, Lisa. Eoin. Don't you make a show of me. Look, forget about the money. This is our big day and we want to have a great time. Don't worry about the expense. Look, we're not skin flints. OK, OK. God, I can't wait! Tell you what, boys, save you money. Don't bother getting married. It's not worth the hassle. Yeah, well it's a bit late. It's all booked now. It's in August and you're all invited, of course. Rachel, you're coming, right? -What's that? -I'm sorry. EOIN: My wedding. You're coming to my wedding, right? Yeah, sure. Count me in. Fucking cunt. Now what is his problem? He should do what I do when something's wrong. Pretend not to see and hope it goes away. It's only fucking software, at the end of the day. Fucking shite software, at that. I mean, it could be worse. We could be the poor bastards that who to use it. I mean, what exactly does this do? I'm fucked if I know. Rachel knows. So what does this software actually do? It's complicated. You wouldn't understand. I thought as much. So how are you this morning? Just don't ask. That doesn't sound good. How's the weekend? Same answer. How's yours? Wasn't bad. [phone ringing] Yeah, no I have to get this mortgage on my own. Listen, I can afford it, if you take my pay rise today into account. I'm hoping they'll give me another five or six. That's not enough? How much of an increase do I need? 10? 10,000 more? Um, no. That's not a problem, at all. Yeah, I'll call you back. Fuck's sake. Fuck it! Fucking! Fucking! Fucking! Tracy, yeah, um. We need a new printer. Do you have a catalog here? [phone rings] Martin. How are your kids? Oh, they're fine. You must be very proud of them. Yes, I am. Thanks. Well, Rachel. First off, thanks for the last 12 months. We're pleased with your work. Your marketing drive worked well for us. Landed some top accounts, so we really appreciate that. Great. I talked to the directors, and we're very pleased to offer you an increase of $3,000 a year. Three? Yeah, three. I think it's generous. Your salary's already good. Three. That's-- That's too low for my mortgage. I-- I won't get the mortgage. Look, Rachel, you should be happy with this. Plus I rushed this through especially for you. Now, I've gotta get back to my presentation. No. It's not good enough. I won't accept it. In the last 6 months, I've pulled in nearly $200,000 worth of new business. Some weeks I have been here to 9:00 every evening. And you're giving me three grand? It's an insult. An insult? I think it's generous. I deserve 10. That's what I need, and I need to today. 10? Forget it, Rachel, it's not going to happen. I need a rise of 10K, or I lose this apartment. It's my last chance to do own a decent place in this city. Well, that's just too bad, Rachel, you can't afford it. You're just going to have to live somewhere more reasonable, like I do. I don't want to go live in some housing estate on my own, in the middle of nowhere. I found a perfect place just around the corner. MARTIN: In Dublin Four? [laughs] Well, you definitely can't afford that, Rachel. All right, if I have to resign to get paid what I'm worth, then I will. Ooooo. Off you go, then. You know where the door is. You'll be looking a long time to find something better. You're good, Rachel. But you're not that good. All right, then. I resign. Rachel. I'm leaving, unless you give me that pay rise. I can't do that. You know I can't. You're being unreasonable. For fuck's sake, Rachel. What are you playing at? Forcing this meeting hassling me like this? Don't you think I've got better things to be doing? Look, Rachel, buying a property's a very stressful business. We've all gone through it. Let's just pretend I didn't hear your last comment. Let's pretend what I heard was, "Sorry, Martin. Thank you, Martin. You're such a great manager, Martin. I'm very pleased with my little pay rise. I'm going to scurry on back to my little desk, happy as a pig in shit." I am not happy with this. I don't care. I'm your manager, not your fucking therapist. Now, this matter is closed. Your next pay review will be this time next year. Now, if you don't mind, as I'm jogging at lunchtime, I'm going to enjoy one of my wife's fine sandwiches. The door. Mmm. [phone ringing] What about our apartment? Our place together? We spent months looking for this. We're supposed to be buying it tomorrow. We'd be happy there. I know we would. Fuck the apartment. Niall, please. I'm begging you. Forget it ever happened. Let's go back to the way things were. Huh? Let's buy our apartment together, and let's forget all about this. I am truly, truly sorry, for doing that one stupid thing. Can't you just accept that I made a drunken mistake? Can't you-- -Enough! I've heard enough of it. Now get out! --[sobbing] I can't leave like this. NIALL: Rachel, just go. Get out. It can't end this way. NIALL: Get out. I can't go in public like this. All right, then. [spitting] [ringing] Hello? SIMON (ON PHONE): Hello, Eoin. Remember, me? Simon. Simon. SIMON (ON PHONE): Yeah, I'm back in the land for a few days. Yeah, um, hi. SIMON (ON PHONE): Haven't seen you in ages. A year. A year. SIMON (ON PHONE): Want to meet up tonight? In the town, maybe? I'm afraid I can't. I'm meeting a wedding planner. SIMON (ON PHONE): You? Getting married? Yeah. Believe me, I am. SIMON (ON PHONE): Very interesting. SIMON (ON PHONE): How about meeting up for coffee this afternoon? You know, um, it's kind of not a good day. I'm-- I'm kinda busy now. SIMON (ON PHONE): Well, I don't know when I'll be back in Dublin again. OK. I'll, um, see if I can nip it, OK? SIMON (ON PHONE): I'll text you. Thanks. Hi. Simon. Hey, how are you man? Pleased to meet you. You too. And this is the wonderful Lori. Hey. What a view. Dublin looks amazing, huh? Yeah, not so good down there. Streets full of drunks. Pissing. Vomiting. Fucking. Look at the state of these knackers. Knackers! So, Eoin, you have a girlfriend, then? No, not recently. He come here alone. Came with a mate of mine, but he met some girl and legged it on me. So. Look at him. Hey, I like this music. Lori, calm down. Drink more water. Fuck water. I want more booze. Lori, don't drink that, Lori. You fancy her, yeah? Look, I know you're with her. I'm just looking at her. It's OK, Eoin. Admire away. Bet you'd like to fuck her. Of course you do. She's amazing, I'm telling you. I'm just looking at her, you know. You can look at her, Eoin. Me and Lori have a very, very relaxed attitude. Relaxed? Sure. Totally relaxed. We have a very open relationship. How-- How do you mean, open? You know open. Opposite of closed. Open, as in, wide open. Inviting. I think I like him. Can we take him home? Please? SIMON: That's up to Eoin, you know. He's not a stray puppy. My apartment's not far from here. And I've got decent booze. So, guys. You ready to really party? I think we are. [knocking] Fuck off. [knocking] Just shut the fuck up. Polish bitch. Work in some fucking diet. It's all you're good for, fucking finance. [knocking] Shut the fuck up you boring bitch. You should be deported. You're gonna get fucking thrown out. They can't throw me out. I own this place. Polish slut is only renting. [knocking] [speaking french] What does that mean? Just telling her to go and get fucked. Simon, what are you doing over there? Are you shy? I'm never fucking shy. You know that. So, Eoin, What about this body, no? Yeah. You wanna go? What? Yeah, live a little. Now we really turned you on, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Nothing wrong with that. The fuck are you doing? Hey! Relax, it's OK. Eoin, don't be boring. Go with the flow. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Trust me. Don't you? Yeah. Yeah. I do. What the fuck? Shh. Relax. Eoin, Simon gives better head than I do. And boy, is that really saying something. Look, Claire, I'm really sorry about this morning. It was just a slip of the tongue. Let's not throw away something really good. Claire? Claire? Fuck you, you stupid bitch. All right, Rach? Not really. Well, that doesn't sound good. Not having a great day, myself. You fancy a quick fixer-upper? Oh. Yeah, I needed that. Oh. Good on you, Tony. You know how to enjoy yourself. Well, life's too short not to enjoy it. So, what's up, Rachel? Martin wouldn't give me that pay rise. Now I'm going to lose the apartment. Well, that's a shame. That's not the end of the world. It's not like you're in Africa starving to death. Had my heart set on that place. You'll get over it. Will I? Wanted that place so badly. It was so perfect. Calm down, will you, I thought you wanted to relax? Look at me. I'm 30. I have a good job. I earn a decent wage. And still I'm grabbing every penny I can, borrowing way over any reasonable limit, and I can't even afford a tiny fucking apartment in the city I grew up in. Bet it was the most expensive place in Dublin, hm? Nothing special. Small place. Good location. Close to town. Wasn't asking for too much, was I? Yours must be worth a fortune. 900,000, last time I checked. Bloody hell. What did you get it for? 200,000, eight years ago. Oh yeah. Good for you. Ah, well. We all can't be winners. So, where you living now? Renting an over priced shithole in Rathmines. And it smells. Fucking hate going back there every night. Ah, you'll find somewhere. Just keep looking. Would have been happy in that place. Very happy. Now I've got to go off miles outside the city, and even some soulless fucking housing estate. Far away from anyone that knows me and spend the rest of my life stuck in traffic jams. Calm down, will you? I should have done better. TONY: Hm? I really should have done better. What are you talking about, Rach? In general. In life. I should have done better. You know, We're the first generation in this country that were handed everything on a plate. We went to university. Graduated at a time of full employment. We could have become millionaires just by buying the right house at the right time. Or joining the right company. It was that easy. We could have become absolutely anything we wanted to be. We were handed unbelievable opportunities. And some of us, some of us still manage to go and fuck it all up. Aye. You need another blast, kiddo. Look at you. You've got everything. And you're still fucking yourself up. Mom, please. Just lend me another 20,000. I need this apartment. No. I can't move home at my age. Look. It's an investment. An excellent, excellent investment. No. You're telling me no? I'm gonna lose the apartment. I just love Mondays. Everything looking good for Friday? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Still have to check Eoin's module, though he says it's OK. OK. I'm, um, I'm heading out for my jog soon, where we can chat for a few minutes before my presentation? Yeah. Yeah, sure. OK. Is everything OK? Yeah, just tired. Had trouble sleeping last night. All right. Well, make sure you sleep well tonight. We're all depending on you. All right. Here's to a happy life together. The wedding planner gave me a list of five really good photographers' websites. She said to try choose one tonight. The really good ones get booked up way in advance. Yeah, sure, sure look uh, you know, just pick whatever you like. That's now how I want it. I want us to pick one together. Lisa, listen love, I'm under a lot of pressure here, you know. Do I have to do everything on my own? Al-- All right, just calm down. OK. What-- What do you want me to do? I'll email you the websites and then you can help me make a decision. I can't do everything myself. Yeah, I'll talk to you later, OK? Hey, Louise. Hey, it's Tony. Yeah, we met last week. Hey, that's right. How could you forget? Hey, I told you I'd call you back. No, I'm not going out with anyone. What gave you that idea? Trust me. Hey, listen. You want to hook up tomorrow night? Great. OK. OK. I'll tell you what, I'll give you a text tomorrow? OK. All right, then. OK. see you. Yes. Yes. Yes! Another one? It is like shooting fish in a barrel. Where do you get the time for them all? Frank sent me on a time management course, and I highly recommend it. There's some fucking elves staring up here. Here, give us a look. Ha! Fucking crackpot. Ah, yeah. That's priceless, man. Man. Do you ever remember that [inaudible] that used to in the middle of O'Connell Street? Haven't seen her in ages. Ah, yeah. Used to be a few like that. Do you remember little Eoin with the big cross? Yeah. I guess the Catholic tiger just flushed them all away, yeah? Yeah, well. Good riddance to them. Religious fucking nuts. [phone ringing] Yeah, it's Tony here. What, in reception? All right. I'll be down in a second. All right, thanks. I'm, um, getting a sandwich. You want one? No, I'm heading out. Who are you? Hey, I'm talking to you. What do you want with me? You're the one who's been sending me letters. Now, what the fuck is your problem? My name is Maggie Caldwell. Yes. I sent you the letters. Why? I want to talk to you about a will. What will? And what's that got to do with crackpot letters and sending me stupid fucking flowers? I'm the executor of the will of the late Rosemary Caldwell. What? Bullshit. Don't even know a Rosemary Caldwell. She died exactly one year ago this day. It took me this long to track your down. Track me down? Right. I don't know why you sending me letter, I don't know what you're on, but you're a sad fucking nut. Don't contact me again. You want to talk to me, you talk to my solicitor. This is Rosemary. Yeah, yeah. This is Rosemary. That's Mary. That's the name she used, but I always called her Rosemary. She was my daughter. Mary's dead? Sorry, she was a lovely girl. Yes, she was. It was a shame, what happened to her. An absolute shame. That she found herself in a situation, where she took her own life. Mary killed herself? She hung herself in her bedroom. I found her. What would drive a young girl to kill herself? Would you have any idea about that? Why with this beautiful young girl take her own life? I don't know. I have absolutely no idea. Only 19. Far too young for a man like you. Now, wait a second. You slept with her, didn't you? Not proud of it. You took advantage of her, didn't you? No, I didn't. I met her at a night club. She looked older. She was fair game. Fair game. How dare you. I didn't realize she was so young. How dare you talk about her like that. Look. Your daughter's death's a tragedy, but it's got nothing to do with me. Now, I'm sorry for your troubles, but don't contact me again. That's right. Run away. Forget all about her like you did before, but you won't forget about her this time because I won't let you. Fuck off. Run away, like a spineless coward. You need help, missus. Don't you want to know what it is? Goodbye. It's something valuable. Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong? I never imagined it would be like this. What are you on about? Me first time. I thought it would be in some romantic hotel room with candles and silk sheets. You're a virgin? Not anymore. My mother would kill me if she found out. Hey, it's OK. Listen. Look, don't worry about a thing. I'm gonna look after you. You're a nice guy. Yeah, I am. Everyone's gonna be cool. Everything's just-- It's gonna be fine. I'm afraid of her. Who, your mother? She's a strange woman. She's old. Obsessed with religion. I couldn't wait to get away from home. Well, at least you got away. She can't hurt you now. She's got the house like a museum. Everything's preserved. My dad's clothes. He died years ago. My communion dress. My baby clothes. Even my caul. What? My caul. Did you never hear of a caul? It's a piece of skin on some baby's heads when they're born. Some people keep them for good luck. She's got my caul. She carries it everywhere with her. NIALL (VOICEOVER): You're so fucking pathetic! You're so fucking-- god, let me get the right word. Moronic. Cretinous. Retarded. I don't know, what do I call someone like you? What do I call a complete fucking idiot? My darling Rachel. The stupid fucking whore, isn't that what you are? Well how else would you describe yourself, going home with some guy you just met in full view of my friends? I'm curious, what exactly did the two of you do last Thursday night? Well? Did you let him fuck you, Rachel? Well, Rachel did he fuck you? I never, ever want to see you again. Now, get out of my life. Go on, get the fuck out of here. Shit. Beat that. Bastard! Fuck that. Not a bad shot. Yeah, great shot. Thinking of growing a beard. It'll make you look older. Yeah? [laughing] (WHISPERING) You've got to keep down your voice. Hey, lads. What took you so long? David. On a bit of a golf slow today. So, lads, did you lose your balls? Would you look at these? Pissed already. How'd we end up married to these slappers? Don't ask me. BRUNETTE WOMAN: So, who won? Who do you think? Did you win, Frank? Sure, as always. Don't worry, dear, you'll win someday. DAVID: Yeah, someday. Hey, would you mind taking a photo of us? MAN: Oh, what do you want that for? Oh, come on. For the laugh. Sure. Say cheese. Cheese. [honk] Bang on time. Good man, Eoin. Yeah, I'm, uh, under pressure today, so let's get down to business, OK. I should've been here five minutes earlier I've gotta improve my time for the marathon. Yeah? Just give me a moment to catch my breath. Take it easy. You're looking very well today, Eoin. You know I'm not into that snogging and stuff, just-- you know what I like. Indeed, I do. Whatever you say. You're the boss. I thought you were the boss? Come on. Come on. Oh yeah. Steady as she goes, captain. Oh, jeez. Don't even think about stopping, I'm nearly there. Keep going. Fuck, nothing beats a midday, mate. Oh, fuck! Oh! Oh! Oh. Ah, fucking hell, Martin, you've got a fucking knack with that wrist. Always glad to be of service to my employees. Jesus. Better be getting back to the office. Do you want a lift? No. I've gotta get in shape. Are you sure? Yeah, thanks. Thank you. All right. So Martin. How's it hanging? Aye? How's it going, Marty boy? How's me old flower? Rachel, have you been drinking? Not at all. Just thought I'd drop in and shoot the breeze with my lovely boss. Rachel, your behavior today is quite bizarre. Why don't you just leave? And let's forget about this. Hm, no. Let's talk about my pay rise. We've already discussed this. The matter's closed. Now, if you don't mind. It's closed when I fucking say it is. And not before. I beg your pardon? You're getting a bargain. A rise of 10 grand stops me walking. Get out. And it buys you silence. What? Does your wife know how you spend your lunch breaks? Does she know you like to give you men hand jobs? Do your kids know that daddy likes sitting in cars with employees wanking them off? I saw you. Shut the fuck up. I say you on Sandymount Strand. Saw what you were doing with Eoin. Dirty little boys. [phone ringing] What? Martin, I've got Richard from the venture capital company on line one. He says it's important. Tell the fucker to wait. I say you getting out of Eoin's car. Saw you wipe the cum off our hand. You're some piece of work. Bet some days, you gotta wipe if off your face. How dare you! Is your wife picking you up today? Nice woman. Does she have any idea? My god, you've got some neck coming in here. This is despicable! How would she react if someone told her? If I told her? It would destroy her. All right, what do you want? You know I want. Give me that pay rise. I can't do that. I fucking earned it. I can't justify that payment to the board of directors. Try justifying the hand job to your fucking wife. Haven't got all day. This is blackmail. This is fucking blackmail. Clock's ticking. If I give into this, you'll want more. How do I know this will be the end of it? All I want is the pay rise. Just give it to me and then at the end of it. Draw up that statement of earnings. Do it now, you fucker! Wreck the place if it makes you feel better, but I'm not leaving here without that pay rise. Oh god, Jesus! All right! You want it? Really, that bad? Here. Here. Take it. Thank you. And don't ever talk to anyone about this again. Ever! You hear me? This is my life you're fucking wiht! Get your cum stained hands off me. One last thing, Martin. Nice hand action. I always get tired before they come. You-- Good news? Yep. I'm in with a chance for the apartment. Good for you. I'm glad somebody got some good news today. [phone buzzing] MARY (ON VOICEMAIL): Tony? Tony? Please, it's Mary again. Why won't you call me back? I have to talk to you. I'm in real trouble here. Please call me back. I have to talk to someone, please. No one to talk to in this city. Please. Please call me. Call me back. [phone buzzing] Trying to dodge your girlfriend, Tony? I'll talk to her later. Treat them mean to keep them keen. Isn't that what all men do? You enjoy treating women badly, don't you? Ah, give me a break, will you? We've a meeting to go to. Sorry for being late. Ah, Fucker! Sorry, I apologize. It's no worries. Thanks, Eoin. Nice to see you boys giving each other a hand. Ah, with a bit of luck, release 4.8 should go out next Monday. Now, quarter one milestones are as follows. Coding. Testing. And release. Now, everybody happy with those? [laughing] What happened, anyway? Listen to this, listen to this. Right, listen. I get this joke in an email and you have to hear it. Is it dirty? Oh! Then why bother talking about it? Exactly. We wanna hear some smut. I will proceed. This rabbit walks into a bar, and he starts to speak. And everyone was shock to see the rabbit speak. And then he orders a ham and cheese toasty. Everyone's totally amazed. So the bar man gives him the toasty, and he eats it, and he leaves. Next night he goes in, he orders another toasty. Eats it, then leaves. I know this joke. Then the third night now, the rabbit walks in and asks for his usual ham and cheese toasty. But this night they're out of ham. So, they give him a cheese and onion toasty. And the rabbit's not very happy with his toasty but he's hungry, so he eats the toasty. Gets a bad reaction, collapses off the bar stool and he's lying half-dead on the ground. Bar man runs over to him in a panic and asks him what's wrong. And then-- He said, I'm dying, I'm dying from mixing my toasties. Good right? That is fucking craic. You're not gonna find another jokes that's better than that craic. DAVID: Ah, what do you expect? I'm drunk. Yeah, so I noticed. David and his jokes, huh? Stupid jokes he got off the internet. Oh, they were all crap. You seemed to like them. When you're drunk, everything's funny. Is that a fact? You're so tense. You need to relax a bit more. Do I? Play more golf. You like that. I'm playing tomorrow. In the tournament. I bet you'll win. Always do. Is David playing with you? No. Didn't qualify. Why don't I make a really good Sunday roast tomorrow? Haven't done that in ages. That'd be nice. I won't be home until 5:00, though. Have to go into the office. On a Sunday? Are you fecking mad? Have some things to sort out. You're too dedicated to that job. I think you prefer your job to me. So if the release goes well, we'll have a few drinks next week. I won't argue with that. Last Thursday was a bit of a laugh. All right, that's it. Thank you. [phone ringing] Yeah? Rachel saw us in the carpark. She's fucking blackmailing me. Fucking hell. Well, what did you do? I had no choice. What could I do? For fuck's sake. I had to give in to her demands. Martin, you're a fucking idiot. Let's give her license to do whatever she fucking wants now. We can't meet up anymore, all right? Yeah, sure, yeah. You may want to have a word with her yourself. OK, if she fucking tries to blackmail me, it'll be the last fucking thing she ever does, I can tell you that now. Will she tell the others? Yeah, she could. Down in the pub with a few fucking pints, she'll blurt that out, she's a fucking mouth, she is. Oh, fuck. Fuck. We are fucked. My wife is very conservative woman. This would destroy my marriage. I don't think Lisa is going to think it's a barrel of laughs, either, Martin. Fucking bitch. I want a word with you. Bet you do. You fucking listen to me, you keep your mouth shut. I'm not a fucking idiot like Martin is. Oh, like him, do you? What about Lisa? Does she know? You shut up, right. What are you marrying her for? Does she give better hand jobs? Does she know she's gonna be a fag hag? You shut your fucking mouth, right. Calm down, Eoin. I got want I want, and you're getting what you off Martin. So we're all happy now. Aren't we? Fuck you. Fuck me? Oh, I bet you'd rather fuck Martin. You'll get bored just being pulled off. Won't be long before the two of you jump into the back seat of that car. You fucking bitch. Temper. Does this mean I'm not invited to the wedding? I was going to buy a hat. Well, I was expecting some other chit-chat, but this, this is juicy. You and your boss. I'm glad you find it entertaining. So why are you getting married? Why spoil all the fun? Same reason everyone else does. I love Lisa and I want to, um, you know, I-- I want to have a family. Mm hm. You don't sound too convinced. Face it, Eoin, we're are not the marrying kind. Men like us aren't meant to have families. What do you mean, men like us? You tell me. What do you think you are now? Straight? Bi? Gay? I don't know. I don't know anymore. I'm , uh-- What are you? I don't put a name on it. I am whatever I need to be to have a good time. You know, I'm not gay gay, you know? Now, I like women most of the time. I just-- I think I'm just a little bit bi. A bit bi? So-- So-- You find a bit bi, Eoin? Well bi is a bit bi. There's been a few men. How many? Lost count. I've learned to spot them, you know. You know, the way they wear an earring, or faggoty lisp, or the way they check me out. So what's it to be, Eoin? Boys? Or girl? It's make your mind up time. You know. Some days I wake up, and all I want is Lisa. They're the easy days, you know? But then there's days, all I want it men. As many as I can get. So who's winning? The pussy? Or the cock? Are we keeping scores? I'd say it's 50/50. Won't take much for the cock to win, will it? If I was a gambler, I know where I'd put my money. I'm glad we met today. I used to enjoy our moments together. Yeah. And, as we are both on a tight schedule, I'll be direct. I really, really, want to suck your cock. Keep your voice down, will you. I want to pull you off. I want to lick your ass as I do it. It's called tromboning. Did you ever get tromboned? You're a-- You're a dirty bastard. Does lovely Lisa ever trombone you? She's not musical. Imagine Lisa. [imitates trombone music] You're a fucking lunatic. I'm going to the toilet. Now. [music playing] Make sure to invite me to your wedding. I could be the best man. I could give a very incredible speech. I bet you could. Keep in touch. Eoin, do the right thing. So, Frank, you've been very quite. I'm just tired. What did you do at the weekend? Played golf. [phone ringing] Hello. Martin. How's it going? Yeah, yeah. Huh. Yeah. OK, um, the server's running perfectly, actually, so. It should be good. We should be good for Friday. Oh, not a problem. Not a problem, at all. It only took about an hour anyway, so it's fine. Yeah. Yeah, I won. [moaning] [moaning] MAN IN BEDROOM: Oh. What's wrong? Oh! Oh, shit! Shit. Shit. Don't stop. I was enjoying the show. Frank, look, I'm really sorry about-- Shut the fuck up. Frank. Don't talk to me. Frank, I'm really sorry. Get out of my house. Frank, I don't know what to say. Get out of my fucking house! How could you do this to me? How long? How long have you two been-- Frank, I-- Tell me. How long? How long? Three months. Three months. Three fucking months? You've been doing this behind my back-- My back for three months? Ah, fuck you. A cunt. Fucking cunt. For three fucking months? Three fucking months! You've been fucking my wife for three fucking months? Easy! Fucking my wife for three fucking months. Please! Please! For fucking three months? You fuck! I've known you from 15 fucking years. Fucking-- You fucking cunt! You fucking low life. You're a fucking low life. She prefers me. Said you were shit in bed. Prick. Frank! Frank! Frank! Please. Please don't. Don't. Don't. Frank, please! I'm begging you, Frank. For fuck's sake, don't! Please, I'm begging you. Don't! Don't! Don't! For fuck's sake. Think about it, will you! No, no, come on! -You're a fucking low life! -I'm sorry. -Frank! Frank! Get off me! Get off me! I'm sorry. You're a fucking low life. I'm sorry. 15 fucking years. You were my best friend. [phone ringing] Why'd you call over? We'll order something in. Have a quiet night, just the two of us. Doesn't sound too bad. About half seven? All right. Can't wait. Bye. Right. I'm done. See you tomorrow. See you. Miss Smith. One final look then. Yeah, but I've made my mind up. It's a fine place. Just buying by yourself, now? Yeah. It's just me. There you have it. Dublin Four. Best part of town. Most people can only dream of owning a place here. It's a good time to buy. The market's calm, but I tell you, next year this place will shoot up. Hope so. Well, there's my final bid. Are there many others? Just one other bidder now. The others couldn't afford it. All right. Look, I'll tell you what it is. It's the asking price plus another 5. So 245,000? Ah, that's a good offer. You know, I shouldn't be telling you this, but um, I know the other bidder can't go that high. So, I reckon it's yours. So, if you have your mortgage approval letter, we're in business. Yeah, I spoke to my bank. Everything's sorted. They'll fax it through, first thing in the morning. The morning? Ah. Is there a problem? Well, all finals bids with mortgage approval have to be in by half past five. That's the deadline. But you'll get it first thing in the morning. The vendor can't turn down an approved bid if he's not sure you have the readies. He's immigrating. He wants to know tonight. I've got to call him now. I'm really sorry, but I'm going to have to recommend the other buyer. No. Look, I can't loose this place. Not after everything I've gone through. I've the highest bid. This place belongs to me. Calm down. Look, let's see how we can work this. You're the highest bidder, you should get it. Let me think about this. Surely there's something we can do. It's unfortunate, you know, but rules are rules. Please? All right. I'll put my neck on the line for this one, I just hope that fax comes through. It will, I promise. Thanks a million. Thanks. Oh, um. I want more than that. Well, I could lose my job here. What's in it for me? What do I get for risking my reputation? Hm? I'm sorry, um, I'm not with you. You know what I mean. Yeah, you do. I say job well done deserves job in return. What do you say? I've done you a favor, and now you're gonna do me one. Eh! Fuck off! I'll report you. Report what you want, it's gone half five. You just lost this place. You'll never afford here again. Never. Get away from me, prick. Where have you got to go to? You got your own place, have you? Somewhere nice? I can't see a classy girl like you living in some bedset. You belong here. You want it so badly, don't you? But how badly? Come on. Close the deal. Mr. Moore, it's Ian. Yeah I want to recommend the bidder. Who is it? I have a young lady here who's made an excellent offer. I recommend you accept it immediately. Lovely stuff. Call by the office in the morning for the contracts. [door creaking] Oh, you're just in time. The wedding planner will be here any minute. I think I've narrowed it down to five dresses and one is a Vere Wang It's pretty pricey, but I want to see what she says. Eoin, what's wrong? Lisa, there's something I-- I have to tell you. What? What do you have to tell me? Something I should have told you before now. I'm sorry, I-- Sorry? Why are you sorry? Is it the hotel? If you didn't like it? Don't worry, we can keep on looking. It's not the hotel. Oh, What is it, then? You're-- You're worried about the wedding? You think it's costing too much. Isn't that it? Look, we'll keep the numbers-- It's not the fucking wedding, all right! I'm sorry. What is it then? I, uh-- Eoin. You have me really, really worried now. What's wrong? What do you have to tell me? What do you have to tell me? What are you trying to say, Eoin? Look at me! [doorbell ringing] That's the wedding planner, I have to let her in. No, please. Please. I-- I can't see her now. No, not now. What's gotten into you? [doorbell ringing] Well, what's wrong? What are you trying to tell me? Please! Look, I-- I'm fucking begging you. I don't want to see her now, OK? Well, what's wrong, then? Answer me, Eoin. [doorbell ringing] Just speak to me. Eoin, will you just fucking speak? What's wrong with you? Answer me, Eoin. Answer me! What it is? [doorbell ringing] What are you trying to tell me? What are you trying to say? Just speak to me! [doorbell ringing] Answer me, Eoin! Eoin! For fuck's sake, Eoin. Please, just tell me what is wrong! Please, just tell me, Eoin. You're everything to me. And I don't care what it is. Just please, please, speak to me. For fuck's sake, why won't you speak to me? And look at me! Why won't you just look at me, for god's sake? Be a fucking man and look at me. Come on! What is wrong with you? IAN: Cheer up, kiddo. You know, one day you'll look back at this and you'll laugh. Laugh at all the real suckers out there. Stuck in the arsehole of nowhere. Commuting two hours every day to work. Fuck that. I have a confession to make. This place, it was always yours. The other bidder pulled out this morning. Said it was overpriced. They were right. If there's a crash, you're fucked. You cunt. Well, whatever I am, I'm not as bad as your ex-boyfriend. He called me. He told me that you'd do anything to get this place. Anything at all. I hope you'll be very happy here. Another day, another dollar. I told you to stay away. Rosemary named you in her will. She's left you something. She didn't have anything, she was a poor student. Now go. The clause expires at midnight tonight. One year after her death. What is it, money or something? It's valuable. You have five minutes and then you're outta here. Or I'm calling the police. This is well out of order, calling up at this hour about some crap over a will. I'm tired. Do you mind if I sit down? Oh, yeah, makes yourself at home. So, what did Mary leave me? I've traveled a long way today, could I have a cup of tea, please? You're fucking unbelievable. I do not have time for this shit. Please. I'm parched. And then I'll tell you everything. This better be good. So, what is it? A piece of jewelry? What? Oh, it's priceless. Priceless? Who is this in the picture? That's my girlfriend, Fiona. Stupid whore. A stupid, fornicating whore. What did you say? This bitch in the picture. She's a stupid, fornicating whore. Fuck you, and your will. Get out. Ow! You filthy bastard! You're scum. A filthy whore bastard. You're everything that's wrong with this country. No god, no models. You and your kind make me want to vomit. You're a fucking bitch. Oh, go on, you old bastard. Call the guards. Look at you. What would your fancy new girlfriend think of you now? All right. Feel better now? You gave me a good kicking. You got it out of your system. Now please, fuck off. My daughter was only in Dublin a few months, studying hard to be a nurse. Never had a boyfriend before, and then you. I didn't know, I swear. To me, she was everything in the world. To you, just a piece of meat. I'm sorry your daughter died. I didn't realize she was that young. That thing between us, it just happened. You made it happen. You took advantage of a young, impressionable, lowly girl. You showed off your fancy apartment, and your flashy car. All so you could have your way with her. And then you threw her to one side, like a piece of rubbish. It wasn't like that. You ruined the most precious thing in my life. Look, Mrs. Caldwell, um, you're obviously still grieving. Why don't you have a drink and calm down. Let's have a drink together. I don't drink. Will the police be involved? No. I asked him not to call the police. He agreed. Is it over? It's over. Why'd you do it, Ruth? I-- I don't know. That's not at answer. I deserve an answer. I'm entitled to an explanation. A lot of the time, I found myself here on my own. You were always working late or playing golf. I got lonely. He started calling around when you weren't here. He said things weren't going so well with Barbara. He said he needed a shoulder to cry on. One thing lead to another. Frank. I'm sorry. I really am. I'll never see him again. I'll never, ever do anything like this again. Maybe you find it hard to believe, but-- it's you I love. Not him. I love you, Frank. Forgive me. Please. Forgive me. He said-- That you preferred him. Is that true? No! Is it true? No! I never want to hear his name mentioned around here again. As far as I'm concerned, he doesn't exist. OK. That goes for Barbara, too. They're not part of our lives anymore. You lured her back here and into your bed. And then you got her pregnant. Well, that's what she told me, anyway. My daughter wasn't a liar. No, she wasn't. All right. I was irresponsible. I was drunk. I know that's not an excuse, but-- She came to you for help, didn't she? Didn't she come up here one night in a flood of tears? Telling you she was carrying your child? No, don't put me through this. Aye, right. I should have handled it better. She wrote down everything in her diary. We've got all this planned, haven't you? Oh, go on. Let's hear it. You told her you didn't want to know. You claimed you weren't the father. You accused her of sleeping with other men. You told her to get rid of it. Thought it was best all around. Do you remember what you said? No, I don't. You said, I want nothing to do with a bug bitch like you. Now fuck off to England, and gets rid of it. Might have had a few drinks on me at the time. If I said that, I bitterly regret it. How could you say something like that to someone so vulnerable? I'm not proud of me self. And I didn't hear from her after that. I wondered what happened. I called her, but she changed her number. She carried the child for four months. I think she was going to keep it, but in the end she changed her mind. Four months? She went to London all by herself and had-- an abortion. No. No, I don't want to hear this. She came home to me. She was crying all day in floods of tears. Finally, she told me what she did. I wasn't as understanding as I might have been. This is difficult for everyone. Maybe no one said or did the right thing for her. No, we didn't. We let her down. I'm ashamed to say it, but I screamed at her. I called her a-- A prostitute. A murderer. Baby killer. That night, she took her own life. Look, Mrs. Caldwell, why don't you let me book you into a nice hotel, and in the morning I'll find someone who you can talk to. Someone who will help you come to terms with all of this. Maybe I do need someone to talk to. Yeah. I'll arrange all of that for you. There was not will, was there? No. Just a suicide note. She wanted you to know. And now I do. So let's call it a night. I will get you a taxi. And book you into a nice hotel. Hm? Come on. Let's go. You must understand, at the time I was beside myself with grief. I wasn't thinking clearly. But still-- I don't regret what I did. Regret what? Mrs. Caldwell, What did you do? You can't grieve without a grave. Hold on now, what the fuck did you do? I asked the funeral director to delay Rosemary's funeral for you a few days. Cause I had business in London. What business? I went there. It was only right. I went to that clinic where she had it done. I told them what happened to her. I asked them to give me back the remains of my grandchild, because I wanted to bring them home and bury them in my daughter's grave, in a proper Christian burial. No. No. I don't want to hear this. Get out. Go on, get out. Listen. Those English, they're a godless nation. They all thought I was mad. -Imagine that. Get the fuck out. But they said it was impossible, what I asked. But I begged them to give me back my grandchild. I got down on my knees and I prayed in front of them. I screamed at them. I screamed, "Give me back my flesh and blood let me take it home It's only right!" Jesus, you're insane. I told them I'd pay for it. I'd offer them a thousand pounds. And the I offered them 2,000 pounds. And then I offered them 5,000 pounds for the body of my grandchild. "Give it to me!" I said. "Give me the fetus!" But the bastard English, they didn't care. They got security guards to drag me outside like I was a-- a criminal. I sat on a bench and I cried for hours. I'm going to book you in a lovely room in a hotel down the road, all right? No, listen. God smiled down on me. This nurse was passing by. And she sat down beside me. She worked in the clinic. She was an African nurse, trained by Irish nuns. Oh god, she hated working in that awful please but she needed the money. Jesus Christ. A bargain was struck. I gave her 5,000 pounds. And she got me what I asked for. What did you do? I brought it back. No fucking way. I arranged all the little pieces. And stitched them together. Mother of god. I can't be sure, but I just know it's a boy. Meet your beautiful son. No. Get away from me! It's OK. It's OK, Gabriel, granny's here. Don't cry. Don't cry. (SINGING) Hush-a-by baby on the tree top. When the wind blow, the cradle will rock. It's all right. It's all right, Gabriel. We can go home now. That's what Rosemary left you. I call him Gabriel. After the archangel. Oh no. I think we're done now. Tony is expecting you. Tony. Tony?
