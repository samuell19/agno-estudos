911. What's your emergency? I, I, I, I don't, I don't know. I, I'm, I just got home and my front door is wide open and there's, there's, there's blood everywhere. Billy, you stay there. Do not come in here! Sir, can you see anyone injured inside? I don't, I don't know! I don't know! My, my wife, she's here, I know she's here, but I can't find her. Sir, listen carefully. I need you to leave the house now. Do you understand? Step out of the house. Oh my God. Oh my God. No, no, no! - Sir. Sir. - No! Emergency vehicles are on their way. Oh my God, no! - Sir. - No. No. No, I didn't talk to him. Because he was on call today. No, I don't know his schedule, you psycho. Yes, I know. He's very cute. Hmm? Mm, not really. Uh, no. I'm good, actually. I also have that pizza in the freezer, so I can just make that. Are you serious? I was gonna... Fine. Fine, I'll go to the store. Do you want anything? Oh, you're not hungry? Yeah, I wonder why. Maybe because you ate my pizza. - Baby. - Hey. How's it going? Well, I haven't smashed my laptop yet, so I feel like it's a moral victory. - Oh, that's good. - Yeah. I don't know, I think maybe I should stay here this weekend and work on it. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Wait, what? No. The deadline is Monday. No, forget that. - I have- - No, there's no way. We're going. We're going. Oh my God. Oh, I'm so tight. Oh, you are, uh, are kind of tense. Uh-huh. How can you tell? Well, you know, I'm a doctor. I'm trained in these matters. I know where all the parts are. Do you have a cure for me, Doctor? I do. I do have a cure. Maybe I'll whip up a cure for you. - Ah, okay. - Let's put you like this. This is all very scientific with pressure points and chakras- - I see. - And things like that. - Uh-huh. - Feel that? - Uh-huh. - Oh, that feels good. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby. What was that? Okay, babe, don't stop. - Come on! - Okay. Okay, don't stop. Somebody out there? Go check. - Oh, come on. - Babe, go check. Fuck! I can't believe this shit. Okay, bro. Game's over. You've had your fun. Fucking pervert. Todd! Stop it, no! Stop it, no! No!

Karlie just told me that you're going out of town. Decaf. Please tell me that you're smoking too much weed. I just need a couple days for a little R&R. R&R, honey, can you say deadline? Look, I told Roger we'd have the new pages by Tuesday. Now, I know I'm a product of the Los Angeles school system, but that is five days. I know. I know. I just, yeah, I'm just a little bollixed out. Bollixed, like the exercise machine on late night TV with Chuck what's his name? Wow. No. I just, I've got some minor... I don't know, just a little block. Don't you say it. No, you don't. You listen to me. No, you do not. Listen, come over to my place, hang out on the couch, kick back a couple of martinis, you'll be fine. As tempting as that sounds I'm gonna stick to the plan. But don't worry, you will have your pages by Monday. I promise. Does this plan have anything to do with the doctor? Yeah. He's always part of the plan. Ugh. Love. Has he even put a ring on it yet? We're taking our time. Mm, sweet story. Okay, listen, you go and get bow-fingered or whatever it is you're calling it, and I wanna make sure that I have brilliance on my desk no later than Monday afternoon. - Stan's on two. - Okay. All right, I gotta go, baby doll. I love you.

Anyway, the key's under the bright yellow flower pot by the door with a big sign on it that says "Keys under here in case you wanna rob this house." No, I'm just kidding. There's a cabin next door, but nobody's ever there. Fridge is full of food, but there's no booze. Giving you a heads up there. Plan accordingly. All right, I'll try it later. Love you. Bye. ♪ Yeah, the DJ in our head ♪ Has got us feelin' - Something. - You sure? Oh, good afternoon. Wine. Pretty much some pickings, but what we have is on the back wall. Thank you. Not much of a selection, is there? No. Shh. Oh. Oh. Is there a party I wasn't invited to? I'm sorry? Oh, no, just stocking up for the weekend. Okay. For a moment there, my feelings were hurt. So, uh, you staying up this way? Yeah. Yeah, my boyfriend's family's cabin. Much needed peace and quiet for a couple days. Oh, yeah? Which cabin is that? Really angling for that party invite, huh? I'm sorry. We're really nosy up here. Oh, no. I'm sorry. It's big city manners, right? The Conrad cabin in Northdale. 35.47. Oh, uh, okay. Thanks. You be careful up there. I mean, there's not much in the way of humans this time of year, if you know what I mean. Well, you know, I'm counting on that, so you know what I mean. Yeah. Well, it was nice chatting with you. You, too. Sam. Mind your own business, Dina. We don't know nothing about nothing yet. You shoulda told her. Hi there. Hey, I got you. Yes. Yes, you have. Wasn't sure if I'd reached you with the shitty cell service up there. Well, lucky me. My GPS says three miles. Oh, wow. You're almost there. Welcome to Northdale. Really? Home of the, uh, I don't know what they're the home of, but it's ours for the weekend. Oh, I can't wait. I wish you were coming tonight. Oh, me, too. After this fucking week. Brutal. Come to me, babe. I'll make it all better. Yeah, I'm aware of your skillset. It's what gets me through the day. Hey, but look at it this way. You're gonna have a whole day to work on the book. Yay! Ugh, God, I have no interest in writing for three-year-olds anymore. They're stupid. They lack all thought and reason. Aw, you're gonna make a wonderful mother someday. You got my message, right? Yes. Yes, thank you. I would've died without wine. - Wow. - Stop. You know what I mean. I do. You're a snot-flying drunk. Hey, I think I'm here. It's nice, right? What? The front door is open. - Jack? - Hello? Blake! Jack? Shit. Hello? Is there anybody here? Hello? Hello? Oh. Mm. God, get a grip, Sinclair! Oh. Who's out there? Is somebody out there? - Ah! - For reals? Payback's a bitch. You look tired. That's because I am. ER 8 is open. Take a quick nap. Oh, that sounds so good. Thank you. Another whole pile. Um, yeah, that'd be good because Blake would kill me if I slept all weekend. Oh, that's right. This is the big weekend. - Nervous? - No. - Maybe a little. - Don't be. You have nothing to worry about. You're two peas in a pod. Oh, that's really corny. But thank you. Should probably hang on to these, Heather. I have a nap to do. Wake me in an hour! Sure thing. Why not? Hmm? Some, uh, interesting reading. My wife gets 'em, and then she quizzes me. Your secret's safe with me, sir. Is there something I can help you with? It's talking about this. Just came in. - Northdale. - Yep. - Isn't that where- - Uh-huh. Hi, this is Blake. Leave me a message. Baby! Hey, I'm on my way. I gotta make a quick little stop at the hospital. I promise I'm in and out two minutes. And then I'm coming after you. Can't wait to see you. You better not be smoking. Hey! Hey, I know that you're out there, okay? This isn't funny. Just leave me alone! Oh my God! Oh my God! Hello? Come out! Help! Is anybody home? Please? Hello, hello? Hello? Help, help! Hello? Anybody? Hello, is anybody home? Shit. Okay. No, no, no! Shit, shit! Fucking kidding me! Oh. Excuse me, sir! Sir, can you help- - Blake? Hello? Baby, can you hear me? Blake? Hello? Hey, baby. I lost you for a- - Hi, this is Blake. Leave me a message. Fuck it. Call Anza Sheriff's Department. Oh, no, no. I'll get it. Sheriff Logan. Hi, this is Dr. Jack Conrad. I'm calling because I'm hoping I can get someone to do a wellness check for me. Is this a medical emergency? Uh, I don't, I don't know. Really it's more of a gut feeling, I guess. It's, it's, it's my fiance, well, my, my girlfriend. Her name's Blake Sinclair, and she's up there alone, and I have not been able to get in touch with her. Cell phone service around here is sketchy at best. Drives us nuts. Oh, no, I know, I get it. But there's something, something strange here because I, I've, I've called several times and it's always gone straight to voicemail. And the last time I called, someone picked up the phone. I mean, I could, I could hear them. It was like, someone was there, I could hear 'em listening, but no one talked, and then it disconnected. I called right back, and then it sounded like someone was smashing the phone or something. Okay. What's her location? Well, she's up in Northdale at my family's cabin. - Northdale? - Yeah. Yeah. It's about four miles out of town off the Douglas Pine Highway. Stand by Doctor. Talley! Get in here. Doctor, what's your address up there in Northdale? 31 South Sycamore. 31 South Sycamore. Is this the number I can reach you on with the 479 area code? Yeah, yeah, that's my cell. I'm on my way up there now. We're about an hour from there. I'll send a patrol car up there to take a look. Thank you. Appreciate that. Like I said, I don't know why this is bugging me. It's more of a gut feeling, I guess, but- - Sometimes those are the best kind. - Drive carefully. - Thanks. - Northdale? - Yeah, Northdale. It's a pretty popular place as of late. Yeah, I have to agree with you on that. So many things going missing. Why don't you take a little ride up there and poke around a bit? Copy that. Jack? Oh, come on, Jack. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh God, oh God. Oh, Jack, no. What are you doing? Jack! Open the door, open the door! Open the door! Oh, oh, Jack! Oh, God, we gotta get outta here! There's a man, and he was in the house. We gotta get, oh my God! No! Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? - That's weird. - Talley! Talley! Go, Sheriff. You've gotta make it over to the Conrad house. We haven't heard from him and he's not picking up. Something's not right. On my way. I wanna hear something the minute you hear something. You got that? Yes, sir. - And Lynn. - Sir? Don't piss me off. Watch your back. Copy that. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. No, no, no! No, no! Sheriff's department! Sheriff's department! Shh. Holy shit. Why? That's it, come on, come on. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. You're safe now. It's okay. It's okay. Where is he? Where is he? No, no. Where is he? - It's all right. - Where is he? We gotta go. It's Deputy Talley here. We need help. Multiple bodies. Okay, so here's where we're at. We had a chance to read the new material over the weekend. Well? And well, it's quite the departure. - And? - Well, we love it. Of course you do 'cause she's a genius. Uh, who would've thought that we would've gotten a book like this out of Blake Sinclair? I did. That's who. Well, of course you did, Nina. Is there a title yet? "The Survivor." Okay, well, uh, we will go with a major release here in the U.S., and then we will blitz the international market with translations. - Hey, Mr. Means. - Hey, Penny, come on in. Honey, we gotta go. Penny's here. How you doing? - Good. - Great. - How's your mom? - She's good. - Thank you. - Oh, good. Babe, we gotta go. I don't know why you have to watch every single trailer all the time. I like the trailers. Oh, hi, Penny. Oh, you look so cute. Thank you. How's your mom? - We gotta go. - She's good. Thanks. - We gotta go. - Okay, so Ashley's asleep, so you are all good there. And there's food in the fridge, so just help yourself. Oh, you have our number, right? Honey, she's had our number for two years. Don't be a smart ass. You guys go. Have a good time. We will try. And just don't put the TV too loud. - All right. - See ya. - Bye. - Bye. Ashley, what are you doing out of bed? - Ashley? - Scared. Scared? What? The Monster Man. There are no such thing as monsters. I promise. Back to bed. Your mom will kill me if you're not asleep when they get home. Ashley, you're shaking. You promise there is no monsters? That's right. There are no monsters.
