Mo¿e s³yszeli ?? cie or Cabo Blanco, a mo¿e nie. It is a small fishing village off the coast of Peru. When I got there for the first time, it wasn't on the maps I know. Nevertheless, it is the end of the world, a place where legends are born. I followed a certain lead and I want to tell you about it. By the way, my name is Lewis Clarkson. And this is my ship, HMS Orient Star, sailing in the middle of the bay. Piêæ thousand od Cabo Blanco. CABOBLANCO where legends are born ... W sam¹ hair, Cabo Blanco. Yes, have a beer at Giff's. Just come back. I don't feel like going in there. At least try it. This is the best weather in a month. - Valves okay? - Yes, sir. Good morning, Gordon. He started descending. - I think it's okay. - I hope so. - Probably another rock. - Not this time. Drooping, five knots and diminishing. - 30 meters, keep it up. - Got it. Got what you wanted? No water movement. Lower a little and do not move. Stop. Stopped. - I think we're lucky. - This is it? Byæ mo¿e. It is definitely a wreck. Read 50 lat, mo¿e d³u¿ej. This is not "Brittany". Everything is shaking. What's happening? It's not our place, Johnny. Lewis, I'm not kidding! These are not jokes! You can't see anything upstairs. Lewis? There is something in the water like paint. Johnny, are you okay? We better get you out. Get it out! Hang on, you'll be upstairs soon. Lewis, can you hear me? Can you hear me Lewis? For God's love, answer me! Lewis, answer me! HER FIRST DAY AT CABO BLANCO Good morning, what can I be of service? I was told you wanted to check my passport. Thank you. It's just a formality. Please sit down. Lamb! Get it out of here! - You want what? to drink? - No thanks. You are French. What is the purpose of your arrival, Miss ... Allesandri? I did business in Lima. A friend encouraged me to visit the coast before returning. City people always say that. I would prefer to live in Lima. Your photo hardly shows the actual state. That's what kind people say. What are you doing in the bay? I told you. Humboldt Current Map. Humboldt probably did it 100 years ago. He hadn't examined it thoroughly. In fact, it's hardly at all. He was named after him because he was a great scientist. But he did not mark its course. A scientist should know this. Giff Hoyt? - I'm Marie Allesandri. - Welcome to Cabo Blanco. - They say you rent rooms. - That's right. - Bad prices with breakfast. - I rarely eat breakfast. - Pepe, take it? your suitcase. - All right, Senior Giff. Dziekuje. Pepe! 23. I'm sorry, madam. - What are you bringing here? - I'm looking for an old friend. Senior Terredo, you are always welcome. Come on. Hello Terredo. I must say, senior, that one day, I'll just shoot your big caniero. He likes you. He's just teasing you. Don't blame him. He doesn't do this with anyone else. This private army is a reflection of the lord himself. Eighty meter. The governor gave me a canieros in the image of palm trees, and everyone is happy. Tell me, the English ship has already left? Not yet, but it sails to Ecuador in the evening . Do you want me what? to say? It probably has nothing to do with our plans, but in the morning a young French woman came from Lima . What's his name? Marie-Claire Allesandri. Marie Claire? Do you know pan? She did not give a valid reason for her arrival. - Giff? - Do you want a lady? Where does this name come from? - From the racing. - Did you win? I was not doing well until the horse crushed me. It's a name that doesn't matter now. - I'd like to what ?? ask. - Yes? Who are you looking for? My beloved. Jacques. Jacques Le Coeur. - He's here? - No, why should he? Postcard from your hotel. Jacques sent her from there. "All Days and Nights." Lovers' secret words. We worked together at Resistance. We saw each other two years ago. His ship "Brittany" left Marseille, and I have never seen Jacques again. - French crew? - Mostly German. Jacques worked undercover. Didn't you know about this? He didn't confide in me that way. I left France shortly after his departure. I recently came back and found a postcard from Jacques. What happened to him? It was the first time I saw him being thrown out by the waves. - He was shot. - He is dying. But he didn't die. He stayed at my hotel. And one day, when he didn't need anyone anymore, he left. He tidied up everything and walked away. - That's all. - Without a word? No words. I wonder if he has stopped stealing money. So people get money for the road. - What are you talking about? - Jacques isn't here. Opu ?? ci³ Cabo Blanco. At 6 PM , the bus stops in front of the hotel . You will come to him. To ten. Get to know him and make friends. - Good evening Mrs. - Good evening. - You found this person? - No. I'm sorry. Can I get you a drink? - Agreement. - Great. I'm Lewis Clarkson. I'm here on business. Maybe a week or two. We had an accident and had to go ashore. - Good evening. - Terredo? Miss Allesandri, I must ask for your passport again. - For what? - Got a new command. From who? Why who ?? are you interested in Miss Allesandri? Probably in your countries these matters are better regulated. You also do not have a mess in politics like in our country. Please go away. She did nothing. You certainly are. But then the police chase ... the innocent, right? Please, now. Giff? - I thought you were going to Lima. - The police took my passport. Hell! She couldn't? village ?? æ to the bus? This time, do as I say. You are to stay at my hotel. I'll try to get your passport back. - Mr. Terredo is busy. - Relax, he's expecting me. Why did you take your passport from a French woman? This is nothing unusual. Normal routine. Investigation. - On what? - What's the difference these few days? You do not have such charming guests. Come on, Terredo. I know Beckdorff orders you. You were with him after the bus arrived. Why is he trying to stop her? Why are you interested in this? Why is it so important? It's stupid. You are exaggerating too much. Man disappear, chased. No identity. A man who survived thanks to the kindness of others. Courtesy, good yourself. You receive a check every month. Go, girls now. Be careful, Giff. Nothing is working in this country. Even corruption. - We made a deal. - But with Beckdorff she's better. He's got a gun license. I cannot let you meddle in his affairs. You're a terrible cocksucker. I'll talk to Beckdorff. Time to get to know him. What if you leave the States? What?? dramatic? Gas chamber? To mo¿liwe. Giff Hoyt, to meet Beckdorff. Mr. Hoyt is here. Yes, senior. Mr. Beckdorff is at the beach. We finally met. You could come down the hill sometime and meet us. These canieros are probably troublesome. They guarantee no surprises. Nights are not my best season. But you probably know that. Hi, Giff. Fallen in ?? with visits? It's very nice. - Are you okay? - Nice that you ask. Honey, how am I doing? Why don't you come back to Lima? Eat ?? to home. - Hero. - I want to make you addicted to whiskey. - Terrible said. - Go ?? to home. I can't go back where I 'm from. - Even at the cost of his life? - Yes. And that's the whole problem. She is hopeless. Don't worry. We will not despair. Even after the Englishman who died today? I was told the sea ​​seemed to explode. Apparently it was dynamite. Who but you have dynamite here? What if the English ship returns? - Another blast? - Will he come back? Would you do the same? The catch in this place is no secret. Giff, b¹d ?? Mr. Rozs¹dny. Please stay away from non-own affairs. Forget about the ship, and about the girl whose passport was taken. I heard you are a simple man. You have come to Cabo Blanco and have found your place. Why do you care for a girl without a passport? Because he is here against his will. Why? Will you use it? And what next? - Leave Cabo Blanco alive? - Are you questioning me? You blame me for the attack on the ship and that I want to hurt what ?? French. Who Said She Was French? I can assure you that if Terredo kept her passport, it probably has its own plans for her . She's beautiful? You have Terredo to return her passport. You don't listen to me, but I don't blame you. The girls' choice at Cabo Blanco ... Hera is completely drunk now, when she drinks she is not thinking. And these are her best moments. I don't want this girl to die like that Englishman. I cannot be held responsible for whether she is alive or not. Everyone gets killed sooner or later. A umrzeæ w Cabo Blanco, what, there is a picturesque cemetery on the beach. It's nice that you like it, because if this girl what ?? will happen ... you will rest in peace. I don't have your passport. Let's go to the boat. I'll take you to Concepcion. There you can catch the train to Lima. Pepe will pack your things. I won't get through. Without a passport, I'll end up in a Peruvian prison. In Lima you will say that they stole it. You will get another one. I don't want to leave. Maria! - Marie. - Marie - Maria! It's about your life. W Cabo Blanco mo¿esz zgin¹æ. No, I'm not going. DAY TWO "I declare that John Frederick Baker died of asphyxiation caused by drowning. " Signed by Dr. Rudolfo Ramirez. This is sick! The bathyscaphe was attacked. - How do you know that? - The body was massacred with an explosion. There is no proof of any kind. Because your commissioner had them burned on the same day! This is the normal procedure. - You know he was murdered. - Mr. Clarkson! If you can't behave properly ... You were probably drunk again and only gagged: "General, now you have Torredo under your control." Enough, Mr. Clarkson. Please be silent! Please, go back, or they'll take you out of court! Concluding: a diver from the SS "Orient" died during the execution, the so-called dangerous profession. Verdict: fatal accident. Dziekuje. - Bustamante! - Hello, Senior Giff. You know what, I did a dive. Per³y, wszêdzie per³y. Pablo said the oysters will be out any day. One good pearl and I'll get out of debt. Pablo said I could dive with him tonight. - What do you think about it? - That you should? stick to the fish. This! - What was the verdict? - Fatal accident. Son, do I curse the day I started ?? work for Terredo. Earth! - There will be an inquiry? - Exactly. It's over. We'll see. Never seen what ?? so disgusting. You won't get away. And you have superiors. Clarkson! Come on, let's have a drink. Thanks. It was good! - Scotch? - Yes. How is London looking now? Purely. In a few years, no one will know that bombs have been dropped there. For you. Za Whitehall. And MI5, isn't that your company? Or maybe the secret services of Her Royal Might? Sk¹d ta my ?? l? Actually, we are a private company. Geodetic measurements, maps. We are looking for offshore oil deposits. Come on, Clarkson, just look at your gear. You know the man on the hill is looking for the same thing. What is Beckdorff looking for? He's looking for "Brittany". What?? does it tell you? - Who is he? - Who ??, who is not to be taken lightly. And he's quite cunning about making the rules at Cabo Blanco. MI5 should take a closer look at Beckdorff. He is better guarded than the crown jewels. I advise you not to try. He has a permit to search in local waters. As we ?? lich, who wysadzi³ bathyscaphe? - What was in "Brittany"? - I haven't been told. I can tell you this much. I was told to find her. Good luck. Please wait. Senior Terredo, it's the governor of Concepcion calling. Wait outside. It's Terredo. Glad to see you. Beckdorff called me. What?? is going on? - Are there what? problems? - Nothing hit me. On the occasion, they are investigating Hoyt in the capital . Has been around for a long time. Americans are interested in his return. Mr. Hoyt has always been grateful for our kindness . Perhaps she could be more grateful . What if the Americans make an offer? Then we will compare the benefits of each of them. - Where are you going with Cabo Blanco? - Rosa, that's enough. Your questions make me feel like an interrogation. I had today? phone call from the provincial governor. He had news from the Capitol. The Americans are investigating your case. What are you going to do about it, Giff? A little kindness here and there. Judge it yourself ??. On the house. Out of kindness. Yesterday I prayed for the first time in a long time. Behind her. It was a long prayer. We'll see what it brings. Good evening, Miss Allesandri. You look beautiful. - Campari with soda water, please. - Twice. I have good news ?? The matter with the passport is progressing. - I would advise a little patience. - Good evening. - Hello, Giff. - Can I swear? Let's dance. Beautifully. Torches everywhere. Mother of God! - Did you know the melter. - Topielca? - Is that you, Giff? - Yes. Tell me what to do? He referred me to you. Beckdorff doesn't want me anymore. He said it was you who brought ?? me to Cabo Blanco. You understand what ?? from this? Senior Giff! - What happened? - Go and see! I'm sorry, Miguel. I'm a good swimmer, but my father was better. We'll investigate. It'll help us goddamn it. Another verdict of Torreda? - Old age, contraction. - You know it happens. Giff, let 's talk about the nicer things. For kindness. If Hera is a problem for you, let him stay with me, there is a lot of space. - Don't say anything else. Nothing will survive. Give me a glass. Pepe! I'll take you to bed. Had ?? right. I needed that. The water is wonderfully warm. Tell me about Hera. We met in Lima and felt drawn to each other. She came with me to Cabo Blanco. Hera turned out to be an alcoholic. One night after an argument, she passed away. What are you here for? to Cabo Blanco? Let's kill someone ??. - Show me where it found ?? Jacques. - Okay. I found him here. After leaving the ship, the crew carried to the shore. Horst has thrown them to the sharks to eat. He said without warning. He succeeded. This time he was lucky. I thought when I came here all my feelings would come back. You won't see him again. I guess I've known about this for a long time. What are you thinking about? That as long as you live here, I won't be charging a fee. What are you thinking about? About $ 22 million for "Brittany", in gold, looted by the Germans. And you help me decorate them. Because you know where it is. You know it. Jacques told you about it. I'm sure. Who had to? to say if he knew he might not survive. Who ??, whom he believed. You. So you and I will get them. - No. - Why? Because everyone is looking for it, no matter the price. I want to stay alive and I want you ?? you survived. That's $ 22 million! And what? Will you spend them at Cabo Blanco? But do you know where it is? Senior Giff! To wa ¿ ne. - What's happening? - Senior Clarkson, he's a thief! He stole my canoe and it swam away. Do not worry. I will make sure that ?? he got them back. Why did Clarkson steal the canoe? He believes that he will reach the top of the hill with it. G³upi sukinsyn. DAY THIRD I want what? show. I give it to Jacques. Carry it in your portfolio. "All Days and Nights." The same words were on the postcard. Did you fake them? Why did you do this? I want to know where "Brittany" is. Perhaps he betrayed his chosen one's heart. Even if I know it. Why should I share with you? Because your life depends on it. - Let's talk about the exchange. - Of course why not. - Can I suggest a drink? - No thanks. Maybe a tropical punch? No. We have a partner, a provincial governor. Why? It is necessary to implement the plan. I arranged a transport on board "Brittany". Plan by³ taki, In order to sink it in a certain place near Cabo Blanco. If it entered the port, would be taken over by the Peruvian authorities, and I would stand before the Nuremberg Tribunal. Definitely. But my beloved, on the night that the ship was about to sink, got on the sternum and had to do what ?? such. He put a magnet like this on the edge of the compass, falsifying the reading completely. It's still nothing terrible. We were convinced that we knew where "Brittany" had sank. We didn't know. The governor was impatient. I thought your lover had taken the secret to the grave. So I'm glad to see you here. Where is "Brittany"? I do not know. I can't know. If I knew why would I come? What game is this? - Giff Hoyt was. - Giff? Jacques was saved from the stack. Jacques told him that? And Giff will tell me. - Really? - I know this. Giff is the kind of guy who doesn't get involved. - He will get involved. - For the lady? Giff will tell me, and then we'll do a swap. I'll find out where "Brittany" is and you will find her. Then you, the governor, and I will share everything. How does it sound? Perfect. Rudolfo! - Are you ?? third you? - Totally. You have a job. We're almost there. If Giff Hoyt knew why we didn't get along? Answer me that too. The deal is complete, ordering Terredo to close Cabo Blanco. Nobody comes in and out. The police are to put him in custody, I will listen to him quietly there. You will be there. - How are you? - Awful. Rudolfo! Giff, I've got the ID in my pocket. Plastic explosive? - Well done, Doctor. - You'll get licked. This will be your greatest achievement in your career. Pepe! - Yes, senior. - Where is everyone? There is a curfew in the houses. Everyone had to leave. - Where's Maria? - In her room, she's going away. ?? cisz to trochê! - What did you say? - He's leaving, I helped with packing. The last bus left at six. She wanted to meet you. She's been looking for you all day. You can go home. Good night, senior. Who's there? That's me. Pepe said where? you are walking. Will you go undressed? Ju¿ za po ?? no. This windmill worked for everyone but you. We could be halfway to Ecuador. You know there's a man in your boat with a rifle? Because there is a curfew. It's probably Juanito. He is most comfortable sitting on my boat during curfew. Where have you been ?? all day? Where have you been ??? Why? I sold you. I gave Beckdorff. What are you talking about? What does "I gave Beckdorff" mean? I was on the hill this morning. I saw him. I said you knew where "Brittany" is. That's why there's a curfew. Giff, pos³uchaj. Was it worth it? Was it worth it? Was it worth selling me to Beckdorff? If?? just came back sooner. I was planning to tell you what I did. Then could ?? take the boat ?? and leave Cabo Blanco. And you would say ?? mi, where is "Brittany". What a plan then? Then we would be in Ecuador. I would pass what they want to know to Paris. In Ecuador it would be ?? safe. Marie, I'm safe here. I live here. It is my house. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. Sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. The damn irony is I don't even know where "Brittany" is. It is impossible. It is true. I do not know where it is. It's okay. Blow your nose. Do what I tell you from now on. Mr. Hoyt! Pan Giff Hoyt! Search all the rooms. Hoyt is not in this room. Hoyt nie móg³ opu ?? ciæ Cabo Blanco. Search the rest of the houses. Go away ??. Where is Hoyt? Where is he? Miss, where is Hoyt? Beckdorff wants to know that! Where is he? Speak! Go?? here! Where is he? Where is Giff Hoyt? - I do not know. - You know, bitch! I do not know! Can you tell me! Doctor, I have a patient. - You'll have guests soon. - I'll take care of them. - How's Clarkson? - Okay. - Cold compress. - And a drink. I shouldn't have left you. I'll take you back to Lima. It would be nice. Police! Open up! The office is open from 10:00 to 14:00. - What's happening? - You know the ordinance of Terredo? What's in this room? Chicken bones and other medicines. We'll look there. Zmieñ mi zakrwawiony banda ¿! - Your name is Mr. Clarkson? - Yes. This is my patient, please don't touch him. This man is wanted. We're taking him. With sugar and cream? I expected you before, but then I waited for everyone. - I heard the shots. - Yeah, we're having a terrible night. - Too sweet nights. - It's still far from such. I didn't expect you with a rifle either. This is also a surprise for me. Please let Beckdorff know I'm here. You sent soldiers for me. Shame?? come on, Terredo. Good evening, Herr Beckdorff. Giff Hoyt is here. Were you having difficulties arresting? - Beckdorff, you Giff Hoyt. - Giff. I hope you will not treated roughly. I know where "Brittany" is. If you want to know, you have to go down the hill. I want to make an offer. Come ?? to me alone. You will agree that we have a big problem. I do not agree. Today ?? I can save your soul. I warn you once again. Beckdorff has a gun license. By the time the night is over you might be dead. It happens to the best. Beckdorff must be furious. He's not coming. He will come for sure. He had wasted too much time searching for the sunken treasure. There is our man. Giff, do you know where "Brittany" is? - You'll find out today. - Is that bait? We'll see how it develops. And which way will you go. A wiêc? Which way? It is not enough that I carry a gun. I represent power in Cabo Blanco. I can't show up on the street with a rifle at my back. Everyone must see that you are my prison . You must take that risk. Everyone has seen, you can put your weapons away. It's still my territory. Let us not make mistakes. The Lord's soul just flows down the toilet. Stuffy in here. It's dangerous to be here. Why didn't you say earlier where "Brittany" is? It would simplify everything. Where it is? What will you get for it? Not gold. No, Giff. Not gold. She said ?? him that there was gold on the ship? That's what she told him? Worth $ 22 million. Gold is a magic word. But it didn't work. Giff. There are people who will sell their own children on the mention of gold, and it doesn't bother you. - Excellent. - Herr Beckdorff? - It's not gold? - No. What's on this ship? I would like to know what I am trading. - Your life. - Tell him. Do you know? Of course. Well why not? Those kinds of little things. But valuable to experts. There were full crates on "Brittany". Chests? Chests. Some for you. It was never mentioned. It doesn't close to a total of $ 22 million. As... to. They say it is made of a fragment of the cross of Jesus. Golden incense from monasteries. Krakow Madonna with tears of pearls. Chalices with rubies from synagogues and cathedrals. Oh, an inconsequential jewel. Everything is on "Brittany". Are you ?? large. I just have her words that you know where the ship is. Was she lying? Or who ?? with such an appearance she may be a liar? Jacques left me a letter. - What's in it? - There's a key in it. Giff! This side of the bar. Horst searched this place but you are ?? ingenious. As you know, Jacques was an agent. He was a very careful guy. It is all simple. Let me show you soon. How's it going, Lefty? This is Lefty. Lefty wie. Jacques taught him the coordinates of the position of "Brittany". And the letter contains a key-word after which it is to be spoken. Let him speak. Lefty, do roboty. Pos³uchaj: Coco Loco. Focus. Lefty: Coco Loco. Think of it: Coco Loco. Lefty: Coco Loco. Please, Lefty. Coco Loco, baby. Don't make a fool of me. - Try it yourself! - It's a waste of time, get out! - The parrot knows it, and you know it. - That's 20,000 possibilities. - Are you ?? already dead. - It has fallen into a coral reef. No more pieces! - Where, which reef? - Not when I'm in the pinch. And first, I want to know what I'll get for it. Giff! Do you think I haven't tried? Mr. Beckdorff! Fast! It's about to explode! Is?? Goodbye, Giff! It's about to explode! Terredo, kill him! Kill him. Which way will you go now? Kill him. Ko ?? cio³y, synagogues, death camps, whole crates. Here is a man with a soul. I will treat you to a trip to Ecuador where there is peace and law. They will send you to Germany, where the noose is probably waiting for you. It rains a little, but the sea is calm. Lucky you, Beckdorff. Nuremberg, Nürnberg ... God, it's cyanide in the tooth. He cheated on us. Not me. - An accident? - Suicide. There will be an investigation. I will personally guide him. It will not be necessary. Bury Beckdorff in an anonymous grave. Anonymous? Of course. And as soon as possible. Good night. Giff? What was in Jacques' list? He thanked me for everything. He asked if I would look after Lefty. Lefty: Cabo Blanco. Width 76, length 12. So, Lefty knew all the time. When my ship returned, he told us everything. So we found "Bretania", we recovered the treasure, and, if possible, we returned to the rightful owners. The subtitle? The treasures have a life of their own. He wasn't there, but people came looking for him anyway. A legenda "Bretanii" ros³a i ros³a. I Cabo Blanco prosperowa³o. A Giff? This is Marie in Giff's pool. At Giff's house on top of the hill. In Cabo Blanco, where legends are born.
