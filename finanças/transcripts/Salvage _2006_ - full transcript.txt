- Busy night? - Four customers! Oh–oh, a record! - Will you count it for me? - I always do. Thanks... Good night! Have a good morning. Hm... Please, please, stop it! Please don’t! You don't have to do this. God, Jimmy, you're late again. I told you I got class. - Who are you? - My friends call me Duke, Jimmy couldn't make it, he send me to pick you up. What'd you mean, he couldn't make it? Come on, you can ask him yourself, I know him from the salvage yard. Hey, we even put in a new starter. Listen... Good as new. What's the matter? Come on, I gotta get back. Okay. Do you mind if I listen to music? Whatever. You know you might have to give me directions, I didn't write it down what Jimmy told me. Okay. - How do you know Jimmy? - We're friends. He's a great kid. You know he's always bragging about you? I can't say blame him... I gotta tell you, I think you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen. Thanks. If I had a girl like you, I guess I’d brag too. What the fuck are you doing? I just wanna see your pretty face, you got nice skin. You don't have to touch it. I’m not a leper, I'm not trying to rape you. I'm sure you don't act like that when Jimmy touches you, huh? You're not gonna be a stuck-up cunt, are you? Don't tell me you're another one of those fucking cunts. Turn right here. How about I walk you up to your door, huh? I'm alright, thanks. Mom. Mom, are you here? Jimmy, it's me. Look... um, some weirdo just picked me up in your truck... and drove me home and... and I wanna make sure you're not dead or something. Call me. You know, I can see you through the door. It's me, Duke. You remember me? I just gave you a ride home. What'd you want? Oh, you left something in my car, and I thought you might want it back. What? Your earring. I'm not gonna open the door. Quit foolin' around, open the door. - No. - All right, hey, I tell you what... I’ll just leave it out here, on the porch for you, alright? You can get it later, how'd that be? That would be great. All right then, that's what I'm gonna do, superstar. See you later. Please God, no... Go ahead and press it, I won't pay over-time. Are you okay? Yeah. Don't worry about me, I'll... huh, take care of this for you. Get in. Hey. - What's the matter? - Sorry. Forget it. - Long night? - Work was okay, but... I think I must've dozed off or something, I had this fucked-up dream. - Was I in it? - No. There was like... this creepy guy, who picked me up from work... drove me home, dragged me into the basement and killed me. Oh, man... that's so weird. - I had this crazy dream too. - No shit! Really? You and me, we... we were getting it on, right? And here's the weird thing. Jen, shows up... and you were like... Yeah, I always wanted to do it with a girl. - And, huh... - Right. So lame, I can't even believe we're having this conversation. Well... I know Jennifer’s, your best friend. I just think we should at least ask her, and see what she thinks. Do you wanna have sex with your best friend? Do you think Matt would like that? Okay, let's not go there. You wanna come in? - My mom's home. - Figures. - Jesus mom, you scared me. - Oh, no kidding? You gonna open the door, or you want me to? - Wait. - What? Don't open it. - Hi. Jimmy. - Well hey, Kate? - How you doin'? - I'm great... That is a smokin' blouse you're wearing today. Well, thank you. That's a very nice compliment. You know it almost makes me think, I should take you out instead of your daughter. Eww… get a room! Yeah... well, I'm gonna go wait in the truck. Are you late for class again? Mom... You know that Jimmy is kind enough. to come and get you every morning, because you can't be bothered to get your drivers license, the least you can do is to be ready. None of your business. You're 19 years old, the agreement was that'd you stay here, while you went to school… Blah... blah... blah... blah... blah... Have a nice day! Whoa... whoa, whoa. - Can you... uh, can you push the truck? - Why do I gotta push it? What? You don't even have a drivers license, how you gonna clutch-start a truck? Please. Thank you. Oh yeah, put some ass into it. Push harder! - Is that enough ass for you? - That was a lotta ass, baby. You know that's all the ass you gonna get until you get the starter fixed. Through me is the way, into the woeful city. Through me is the way, into eternal woe. Through me is the way, among the lost people. Justice moved my lofty maker. The divine Power, the supreme Wisdom, and the primal Love made me. Before me, were no things created, save eternal, and I eternal last! Abandon all hope, ye who enter! - Oh–oh... - Sorry about that. Um... we're about outta time anyway... Please don't forget, you have a three-page report on Escolis due for tomorrow. I'll see you then. Watch? Watch this. Come on. What you doing? Let's go. Fuck you. - I'll just carry you. - Okay. What's that for? How about a... picnic under the bleachers, something like that. Somebody might see. So? That makes it exciting. Somebody’s up there. I thought that's what makes it exciting. - Huh, some one's up there. - Yeah, no shit. - Will you check it out? - I just did. Please. Claire... you're acting crazy today. I know, I'm sorry. No... no... no... no! Hello? Is there anybody down there? Hello? Mom? Mom you in there? Turn the light on. What the hell you're doing down here in the dark? Who are you talking to? I lost something down here. I was just looking for it. I guess I'll get it. - Hello. - Hey, what's up? Hey Jimmy. Sam and I playing basketball tomorrow, and I thought maybe you could bring Jen. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, Jen told me she liked basketball. Hey Jimmy, are you okay? - Huh... yeah, why wouldn't I be? - No reason. So... huh, see you at the basketball court tomorrow. - Yeah, okay, see you. - And bring Jen. - Bye. - Will you bring Jen? Are you ready for this, James? This ball in that hole. - Let's go... do it... do it... - I'm doing it right now, ready? - Alright... here we go. - Ohh... - That’s so beat man!... Gosh... - Calm down man, it's just a game. It's so uncalled for, I wanna play basketball here. - So, huh, Jimmy had a dream last night. - Oh really? Let's hear it. You me and him had a three-way. Eww… Hey, Jen you ready? I'm gonna teach your boy a lesson in humility. Alright, let's see it. Yeah... I don't wanna play this anymore. Why don’t you get some game and come back. - Hi, baby. - Nice dream, Jimmy. - What dream? - You told her? Oh yeah, you should tell Sam. I think he’d like to hear it. Ready? No. Show me how to do it, and you push it. Alright, well... uh, this pedal is the clutch. You put your foot on it, push it down, when I tell you to, let it go. That's what you've been doing this whole time? Hm, pretty cool, huh? Learn something new every day. Come on, Sally, put some ass into it. Hey, what did Jen say about my dream when you told her? She thought it was funny. Funny like... how? Like disgusting, or like... that might be kinda cool? If you wanna fuck Jennifer, then just do it, I'm not stopping you. Pop the clutch. Pop the clutch. Oh come on, give me a little more credit then that. I mean... I would never cheat on you. Unless you wanted me to, and if you do, I will do it right now. I will do it right now. Because that's how much I love you. Are you retarded? Take me home... God! Mom? Mom, are you there? Yes I'm here, I'm just getting dressed. Okay. Jeez mom, nice outfit... what'd you got a hot date or something? He's somebody I met at work. He’s… uh, worked there little over a year. What? So, can you... uh, get yourself up... and... uh, to class in the morning? I guess... Because there's a strong possibility, that I may be spending the night. Okay, I get it. Well, have a good night. And be careful... okay? 'Cause I worry about you, in that place all alone. Okay. I will... Thanks. Bye. Have fun on your date. - Oh, hey Gertie. - Hey. - Busy night? - No, it's been dead. Oh, good... I barely got any sleep last night. Maybe I can take a nap. Don't let Cleatus catch you, he said he might stop by later. What's he gonna do, fire me? - Yeah. - I wish. - See you. - Bye. Hello? If anyone is over there? I'm gonna press the alarm. The police are gonna come. Not yet. - It's okay, you’re alright. - He's in there. You’re alright, we'll get 'em. Alright Claire, what’d this guy look like? Okay... he had red hair. And he was... I guess he was like... I don’t know... average height... Um... he... uh... he was wearing this like gray jacket, and... and he said he worked at the salvage yard, so... I guess it had stains… I... and uh... What? Claire, are you high? No. From time to time, you don't... smoke a little weed, do a little ecstasy? - Don’t get... freaky?... - What am I supposed to say? I used to buy it off you in the parking lot, before you became Captain ass-hole. All right, alright, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Alright... let's move on. Could you get the TV and VCR for me? There's something you need see. Alright. That's you, right? - Yeah. - Sleeping. That's you waking up, walking across the store, and getting into a fight with yourself. I don't understand. I felt it. Look, he had red hair, okay? He... He worked at the salvage yard, he.. he had a funny name.. - I don't remember it... - Duke Desmond? - Do you know him? - Yeah... yeah I know him... I shot him death last week. Everybody in this town seems to know that, but you. - He's dead? - Dead and gone forever. I'm losing my mind. Look... it's not surprising... you're having nightmares about this guy. It's been all over the news. We found some kid cut up... in the back of his own pick up truck. I'm sorry Claire, I'll take you home. Let's go. You look pretty tired. Why don’t ya go ahead lay down and get some sleep? I'll wake you up when you get home. Thanks. What the fuck? God!... No! Not you! Shut up! Well, let me guess... That one, right? How did I know that? This just isn't happening. This isn't real. Well, how would you know what wasn't for real? Look. You want me to tell you? 'Cause all of this is bullshit. You, me, everything, it's all made up. The only thing that's real, is what you feel. The only thing that's real in this whole world, "is what... you... feel"... when I cut your head off. Mom! Mom! No! No! No! Shut up! Don't! No, please, don't hurt me. Let go of me, please! Please, don't hurt me. This is not real. This isn't really happening. This isn't happening. This isn't happening. No! This isn't happening. It isn't happening! Please God, no! This isn't happening! No! No... Please, please, God... God... No! No... no... no! Don't hurt me. Please don't, Please... Please. Please. Please! Good... morning. What the hell's the matter with you? Through me is the way, among the lost people. Justice moved my lofty maker. The Divine power, the supreme Wisdom, and the primal Love made me. Before me, were no things created, save eternal, and I eternal last! Abandon all hope, ye who enter!” Sorry about that... We're about out of time for today. Yes, Claire? You gave this lecture yesterday. Well, how would you know? You weren't even here yesterday. Where're you going? What the hell's is your problem? I've went to your house... and your work, looking for you, I've waited. Okay... you're not crazy. You know I'm here to listen, just tell me what the problem is. I'm seeing stuff, Jimmy. Like what? Like people... killing me. And... and it isn't like... I just see it, I... I feel it too... it's like... it's really happening to me. The weird thing is... okay, I saw a picture of the guy who keeps attacking me. Well, that's weird, right? I saw a picture of the man, after I imagined him. What if there's something with this guy, you know? I mean... maybe he's a ghost or something? The sheriff said he was a serial killer... and was shot to death. Man, what the fuck are you talking about? - Well, maybe he's a ghost? - Bitch, are you crazy? What? Ahh… this is so lame! I so cannot deal with this. Fuck you! Wait. Wait, please. I didn't mean to call you the "B" word. Go home, Jimmy. It's just... I didn't know you'd be talking about some... serial killer ghost shit. - Go... - Just... just... let me help you. Yeah? I... I'll help you, just... I wanna help you. Just stop walking down the street, like you're some kinda kook. God, fuck you, Jimmy! You don't even believe me. I do believe you. There is a ghost. Oh, I'm sorry, it's just the funny face you just made, I... I... I do really think there is a ghost. - You're just such an asshole. - I... I am an asshole... huh... you just made me laugh, it was just a funny face. There isn’t a ghost, come on... - Fuck you! - Come on. Hello? Hello? Is anybody here? - This blows. - Can I help you? - God, you scared me. - I'm sorry... if you're here for the... uh, bible study, it's at 3 o'clock this afternoon. Um, actually, we wanted to talk to a minister. - He’s out. - Ask him. But he's a janitor. He works in the church, that's pretty close. Um... I don't know if you can help me, but... I'm seeing ghosts. Well... a ghost, just one... His name is Duke Desmond. Duke? You sure? Don't look at me, I... I haven't seen any ghosts. - He went to this church. - But he died, right? - Yeah, the cops shot him. - Fantastic. Hm, that's all I needed to hear. You ready to go? He had us all fooled, with his… talk of Jesus and salvation. I guess the devil works in mysterious ways these days. Hiding in plain sight. Oh, but you don't have to worry about him though, huh... - He won’t hurt you. - Because he's dead, right? Because he's in Hell. Wait... one more thing. Do you know where he lived? Hm... This is it. This is where he lived. Yeah, it looks like a psycho’s house. It's a dump. Can we get out of here? It's kinda deserted. Okay, great, even better. Can we please leave? Don't... even think about it. What? I thought you didn't believe in this stuff? I don't, it just... this place gives me a bad feeling. Like what? Like you know, when you get kinda nervous... and... you got some butterflies going in your stomach, and... You know this place makes me want to take a crap. Gross. Okay, well, I guess you stay here, and... I’ll go look around. Hello? Is anybody here? Uh... I just need to use your restroom. Jimmy. Come on. Hi, I need Sheriff Miller? - This is him. - Sheriff Miller, it's Claire. Look... um, I'm in a cabin, out off Route 60, and… I... I think something’s happened to Jimmy. I think he might've gotten killed... - I need somebody to come out here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, I can’t tell you what's going on Claire, but... you’re gonna find out soon enough. Who are you now? Where do you keep your old newspapers? Is this for a specific class? - It doesn't matter. - Actually it does. - Philosophy of religion. - Who's the professor for that? What is your deal, lady? Just tell me where it is. Shh... this is a library. Did you find what you were looking for? Claire. Look out! Oh my God, Claire, what's wrong? Close the door. Are you okay? Come on, let's go in the other room. Come here. It's okay, I'm gonna call the police. - It's okay. - No, but I already talked to the police. I'm telling you, I... I think there in on it, I mean… No, it's okay, I'm your best friend. I'm here, I will take care of you. I promise, nothing is gonna happened. You're in a safe place, okay? Okay? Here. Come here, sweety. I called the police, they're on the way. It's okay, calm down. It's okay, Claire, you're safe. Duke Desmond, don't move! Hold your positions, I’ve got him. Okay, okay... You got me officer, you got me. You know, I found that boy in your truck. Why'd you do it? Come on man, what'd you want me say? I don't know... Okay, okay, cowboy. I’ll tell you... - Are you wearing a wire? - What? You’re one of them. I can't sit still, man. I can’t sit still this long. They gonna get in me. What the hell are you talking about? It’s like a radio signal they can track where I am. That's how they must be controlling me... they put a little piece of metal in my head or something, alright?... and tell me what to do. I can't help it... you think about doing this shit! They make me do this, man, like cutting up that little girl. Come on, man, they’re trying to turn me into one of them or something. - Hey. - Hey there... how are you? - Huhh… I’m early huh? We ran into some trouble again downstairs, but… I’m sure… How much has he figured out yet? Hmm?… I can kinda see it in his eyes… He’s catching on… he should be figuring out… Can I watch? Yeah… pretty much… Alright... Push the clutch down. Come on, come on. Claire! I need your help. I need you to help me. Help me, Claire. Mom? Claire! I need your help. Claire, come down to the basement, I need you. Mom? You have to come down to the basement, Claire. No... Please, don't make me go down there, mom, please. Claire, come down and help me, please! Claire, I’m in pain! Oh Claire, he’s coming for me now… I'm in pain. Come down. Help me! He’s coming to get me. Mom? What're you doing down here? Mom? Mom, please hurry... we have to get outta here... He's coming... We've got to get outta here... We can't get outta here. Don't you get it? You’ve got to re-live what you did, again and again... But why? I didn’t do anything mom? Stop calling me that. - You're not my daughter. - Yes I am, I'm Claire. Claire is dead. Because you killed her. Because you killed her... Duke! I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. You want me to tell you? Shh... You wanna know the secret? I shot him death last week. Because all this is bullshit. - You know... you, me... all of it. - Because he’s dead, right? - Because he's in Hell. - I'm not, Duke. Please... I didn't do anything… Abandon all hope ye who enter. The only thing that's real, is what you feel. - Because he's dead, right? - Because he's in Hell. I didn't do anything, please. Please... You’ve got to re-live what you did. I didn't do it! I didn't do anything! I haven't done anything. Please, God, help... Busy night?
