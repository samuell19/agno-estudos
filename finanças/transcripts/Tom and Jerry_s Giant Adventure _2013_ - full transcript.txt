NARRATOR: Once upon a time... ...there was an enchanted land called Storybook Town. This wasn't a make-believe place. It was for real... ...with full RV hook-ups too. Just off old Route 33... ...or was it 66? Anyhow, everyone loved Storybook Town. It had walk-through, fairy-tale sets... ...thrill rides and attractions... ...the best high-diving cow act in three states... ...and a world-class petting zoo. The park was the life-long passion of Joe Bradley... ...a starry-eyed dreamer, if there ever was one. Soon after opening Storybook Town... ...Joe found a partner to share his dream... ...his loving wife, Violet. And it wasn't long before they were joined... ...by their greatest dream of all... ...their son, Jack. For a long time, all was right with the world. [CROWD CHEERING] But life has a way of moving on. And sometimes, the dreamers leave us... ...all too soon. Violet and Jack did their best to keep Joe's dream alive... ...but it was a big job for just the two of them. Once the crowds stopped coming... ...there wasn't money to repair old attractions... ...or broken-down rides. And soon their petting zoo... ...was down to its last two critters... ...a cat named Torn... ...and a mouse named Jerry. [CLANGS] [YELPS] [TOLLING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [BUZZES] [SCREAMING] Oh, no, not again. [GRUNTS THEN GASPS] [WHEELS SCREECH] Come here, knuckleheads. What happened? Thought so. Mom and I are trying to save Storybook Town. We don't need you guys wrecking what's left. Now, look, we're pals, right, Torn? And, Jerry, you and me are friends to the end, right? So maybe you could try to get along with each other? Just for me? Tom. That's better. I think. All right, let's get the mess cleaned up before Mom flips out. You okay, Hermione? I don't want anything happening to our star attraction. Moo. Okay, only attraction. Maybe we'll have lots of customers today. Moo. Okay, one customer. [JACK LAUGHS] Hey, we got one. Torn, Jerry, it's showtime. Mom! Mom! We have customers. Customers? How exciting. I will dust off the corn dogs. Excuse me, Mom. Oh, dear. That's not a customer. BIGLEY: This won't take long. Keep the motor running. Welcome to Storybook Town. The enchanted land where dreams come true, if you believe. Eh, okay. I'm looking for the widow Bradley. You mean my mother? Ouch. Uh, yeah. So where is she? Around. But right now, you're just in time for our big show. We still got a few seats right in front. Okay. No. I don't have time for this. Hey! Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen... ...Storybook Town is proud to present our star attraction. [GROANS] [PLAYING COUNTRY MUSIC] JACK: Hey, diddle, diddle, the cat plays the fiddle... ...the little mouse toots a tune. Now let's applaud for Hermione... ...the cow who jumps over the moon. [JERRY WHISTLES] [SCREAMS] [BLOWS HORN] Phew. What's wrong? Oh, no. You stall Hermione, I'll fill the tank. Come on. [GRUNTS] Oh, that ain't good. [SCREAMING] [WHIMPERING] [SIGHS] [WOOD RUMBLING AND CREAKING] Whoa! All part of the act, sir. What do you do for an encore, kid? Blow up the park? Wait, that's my job. [BIGLEY LAUGHS] What? Oh, I didn't expect you till tomorrow, Mr. Bigley. I know, Mrs. Bradley... ...but why delay the inevitable? I still have an entire day... -...to raise the mortgage money. - Yeah, that's not gonna happen. What's he talking about? Jack, this is Mr. Bigley. Of Bigley's Super Strip Malls. Acres of big inventory, big values, and big profits. My malls are everywhere. And tomorrow, one goes up, heh, right here. [LAUGHS] You can't do that. My dad started Storybook Town. It's part of our family forever. That's touching. But business is business, kiddo. And as you could see... ...I bought the mortgage on Storybook Town. If you miss even one payment... ...the park goes to me and you guys are kissing pavement... ...hitting the bricks, O-U-T, out. We can't give up, Mom. I know things will turn around if we can just last another month. Ticky-tock, kid. You don't have another month. The wrecking crew arrives tomorrow morning. Yep, come 9 a.m., Storybook Town is going down. Hey. Rhyme. Tsk. Get you later. Nobody panic. I've already made arrangements to sell Hermione... ...to Dinkle Bros. Circus. That'll give us enough money to keep going longer. Sell Hermione? She's our friend. Jack, I believe Hermione will love being a circus star. And you remember Daddy's motto: "Dreams come true if you believe." I believe. Well, I'd better get Hermione over to the fair grounds. No, Mom. We'll take her. Are you sure? It's a big job for a little boy. We wanna say goodbye. Come on, Jer. Cheer up, old pouting Thomas. We'll all get through this mess, I promise. [SINGING] When life seems sad with no reprieve Don't wear a frown upon your sleeve Those happy times we can retrieve If we truly do believe Like the joy that kids receive When reindeer fly on Christmas Eve Miracles we will perceive If we truly believe So toss a penny in a well Or wish upon a star But if you can't believe with me We won't get very far So let's have a cheer for wishing wells Lucky stars and jingle bells Those happy days we will achieve If we truly believe If we truly believe JACK: This can't be right. The circus always sets up here. Oh, no, they're leaving. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] We gotta stop them. Whoa! [JACK SCREAMING] O'DELL: Appears you boys are in a heap of trouble. My name's O'Dell. Farmer O'Dell. Got a spread on the edge of the prairie up yonder. That's a mighty fine-looking heifer you got there. I can tell she gives tasty cheese... ...and grade A milk. Well, she might be for sale if we had the right offer. I think she'd like my place just fine. Are you a magician? I know a trick or two, but I ain't no wizard. If I was, I could offer you more than these for your cow. Beans? O'DELL: Magic beans. JACK: Magic beans? Okay. I think we're done here. Just keep walking. Don't make eye contact with the crazy man. Don't look like much, but they'll do miracles... ...if you believe. You traded our cow for beans. Uh, magic beans. [GROANS] It sounded better when the farmer said it. Jack, this isn't one of our little bedtime fairy tales. Storybook Town needed that money to stay in business. We needed it to save our home... ...your father's dream. I know, Mom, but--Tom. Why didn't you talk him out of it? I'm sorry, sweetie. It's my fault. I should have never sent a boy to do a man's job. I didn't think I could feel worse. Surprise. Even if the circus had bought Hermione... ...it would take more than one mortgage payment to save our home. It would take a miracle. [VIOLET SOBBING] Hmm. I'm not exactly sure how this is supposed to work. Maybe we'll just get a big crop of beans. Well, at least we'll have something to eat... ...after Mr. Bigley throws us out. [YAWNS] The important thing is, we all still believe, right? Sweet dreams, my little dreamer. [LAUGHS] [GASPING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [JACK GASPS] Torn! Jerry! UP here! It's Storybook Town... ...except it's for real. [SCREAMS] HUMPTY DUMPTY: Help! Whoa! Whoa! [LAUGHS] Gotcha, suckers. [LAUGHING] Jerk. Must be a bad egg. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Welcome to Fairyland, where dreams come true. Ahoy, mateys. Welcome to Fairyland. [LAUGHS] Wow, he's much bigger in person. Hey, that's the old lady that lived in a shoe. Hey, Peter. Howdy, stranger. Give my regards to the missus. Whoa. Excuse me, Miss Peep. I mean, Miss Bo. I mean, Miss Bo Peep. [LAUGHING] Whoa! [GIGGLING] [WHIMPERING] JACK: Whoa! RED RIDING HOOD: Somebody help! WOLF: Hey, come back here! Hey! [THREE LITTLE PIGS GRUNTING] Oh! RED RIDING HOOD: Huh? Presenting the ruler of Fairyland... ...Old King Cole. I'm a merry old soul. And a merry old soul is me. Greetings, Mother Hubbard. Mwah. And hello, Miss Peep. You are looking lovely today. Pies! Fresh Pies! Get them piping hot! Look, Simple Simon met a pie man... ...going to the fair. Said Simple Simon to the pie man... Let me taste your ware. Ha, ha. And what kind of ware would that be, chum? Hardware? Ow! [LAUGHS] Werewolf? Grr. Hey, I got it. Underwear. Now, look, I only wanted one little wedge of pie. One Wedgie, coming up. Whoa, whoa! Another satisfied customer. Ooh. Fresh victims. Uh, I mean, hungry strangers. Hot apple pie? A steal at only 900 gold pieces. Huh? Now, now, that's not very neighborly. Feed our guests. But, sire, the moola ain't for me. You know my overhead is ginormous. [FOOTSTEPS THUDDING] What's that? My overhead. Matter of fact, he's over everyone's head. Run! Scram! Vamoose! Pies! Closeout sale! Pies! Fee-fi-fo-fum, bring out your gold because here I come. And a happy fee-fi to you, Mr. Ginormous, sir. Well, Your Highness? [BOTH GASP] What insanely valuable tribute are you going to pay to me today? Diamonds? Emeralds? Oh, royal treasurer. Uh, we got something extra special for you today, Mr. G. A whole cart full of big... Yes? "mound". Yes?...golden... Yes? Yes? ---pumpkins. It's the first pick of the season. Ripe and sweet and-- Aah! Now, get this. I don't eat pumpkins. I eat peasants who bring me pumpkins. But, Mr. Ginormous, sir, we've already given you all our valuables. It's true. All we have left are pumpkins. Nice view. Listen, Kingie... ...if you wanna keep your subjects happy, you gotta start with the biggest one. So pay attention, deadpan. Let me show you how it's done. Now, I'm a giant wonder Who lives to loot and plunder I turn on my schnozzola And money, up she rolls-a I grossly gross your income When I growl "fee-fi-fo-fum" When it comes to being bad I'm Ginormous [SNIFFING] You hide your dimes and nickels Silver gives my nose the tickles I'll take all your treasure. Trust me, it's my pleasure A piggy bank tormentor. Fairyland's one-percenter When it comes to big and greedy [GASP] I'm Ginormous [IN NORMAL VOICE] Any of this sinking in? [SINGING] He plucked the tuffet from Miss Muffet In his pocket he did stuff it [SINGING] When he needed a new slipper Out went every nipper [SINGING] He stole bones from Mother Hubbard Shut us doggies in the cupboard When it comes to big and nasty [BELCHES] [IN NORMAL VOICE] He's disgustipating, son. Oh, that awful giant's back. Stop it. What's up, Red? Looking good. I order you to leave these people alone. Oh, you got it all wrong, sweets. They're happy to share their goodies with me, right? Happy- Happy- [SINGING] Ginormous, here's your wake-up call You're headed for a great big fall So says the ancient prophecy. A hero will rise to set us free [SINGING] Fine with me, Red, bring him on One swat from me and, bam, he's gone When it comes to big and brutal I'm Ginormous [ALL SCREAMING] So now you've got the breakdown. From the master of the shakedown Pinching pennies from the needy. Being crass and cruel and greedy Gross and crude and seedy. Not to mention rude and vile I'm a rotten, evil deed-y [IN NORMAL VOICE] Cash me out. I'm coming home. [SINGING] When it comes to being bad I'm Ginormous, baby [IN NORMAL VOICE] Bye-bye. [RED FAIRY GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [SIGHS] Are you okay? I think so. Thank you, strangers. I'm the town's protector and resident good fairy. Though lately I haven't been doing a very good job. Can't you just zap that big bully? I could, if Ginormous hadn't stolen my magic harp. What little power I have left... ...isn't enough to stop him. There's gotta be a way to get your harp back. O'DELL: Oh, it won't be easy. Hermione. Farmer O'Dell? Actually, I'm the Farmer in the Dell. Like in the nursery rhyme? I live here too. Ginormous has been making life hard on us for a long time. Besides the Red Fairy's magic harp, he stole my king-sized golden goose. All the townsfolk's valuables. Our entire life savings. [BARKS] In bones, that is. And he still shows up every day to pick us clean. An ancient prophecy said... ...that a giant would one day menace Fairyland... ...and that a great hero named Jack would appear to defeat him. Hey, that's the old story of "Jack and the Beanstalk." It may be an old story to you, chum, but it's breaking news to us. Wait. You mean I'm the Jack destined to fight the giant? Jack? Jack? He's here. Jack? MOTHER HUBBARD: Jack? Jack? He's the one? DROOPY: Jack? Yes, Jack. You and your brave friends. Look, guys, I'm just a kid from a run-down amusement park. You need, I don't know, someone bigger, stronger. You need a hero. What we need is someone who believes in himself. Well, in that case, I believe we can try. [ALL CHEERING] We can't go inside, Jack. The giant knows us all by smell. We have an inside man ready to help. You won't be going in alone, kid. Tex sent me. Don't be scared, Tom. You'll like Tuffy. He's a mouse, like Jerry. Ah. Hello there, little, tiny kitty cat. [SCREAMING] Shh. Hush, now. We don't want the giant to hear. Tuffy, these brave heroes are helping us get my magic harp back. Would you guide them to the treasure room? Would I? It's about time someone took old Gi-nasty down a peg. [SNIFFING] SCREWY SQUIRREL: We'll never see those chumps again. [ALL GASP] What are you doing here? We thought we'd spare you the trip into town tomorrow. So you brought my tribute a day early, huh? But where's the loot? Well... Since the villagers don't have any valuables left... ...they thought they'd bring their... Their, uh, talents. Our whatsits? Talents. [TICKING] [TRAP CREAKING] Hey, must've got that mouse. Hey, big guy, here's the deal. They're offering to put on a show. For your dining pleasure. [CLOCK TOLLING] And there's no cover charge. Okay, if I like your acts, you live. If not, I'll grind your bones to make my bread. Hmm. Running fast again. This show better be good. Start the show. A recitation by the Farmer in the Dell. Well, it's been a quiet week in Fairyland, my hometown. Just off the beanstalk at the edge of the clouds. This time of year, there's lots of frost on the pumpkin. [GRUNTING] O'DELL: Cinderella's been having a hard time... ...scraping the ice off her coach. This cold weather's been wreaking havoc on Old Mother Hubbard. Old Woman in the Shoe is having to lace it up tight. Of course, the three pigs are laying in extra firewood for winter. Once it turns cold, those hungry wolves... ...just keep on dropping down the chimney. Next. [SCREAMING] [GASPS] Screwy, you're on. Wait, I have no talent. [SINGING] I'm Screwy, the pie man. And you won't believe your eyes When you see how much glee. A squirrel can make with pies [SCREWY SQUIRREL YELLING] Mm. Tasty. Thirty-six, right. JACK: Whoa. Whoa. Thirty-six, right. Twenty-four, left. Twenty-four, left. Thirty-five, right. Thirty-five, right. OLD KING COLE: Thank you. Thank you. I would like to perform the world's fastest card trick. Wanna see it again? This better improve. [JACK GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [TUFFY GASPS] [GASPS] JACK: That's a lot of loot. So, Tyke, you're in the first grade now. How do you like school? Closed. [LAUGHS] That's a killer. Ha, ha. Ah! Mes amis, look. TUFFY: The magic harp. Say, I hear there's a oat next door with no nose. How does he smell? Awful. [SPIKE LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] JACK: Whoa! [CLUCKING] Stop playing around. You better hold onto this, huh? [HONK$] That must be the farmer's golden goose. [SPIKE LAUGHING] Next. Hurry up, Jack. Think you can crack it, Jerry? [CLANGING] [BUZZING THEN WHIRRING] [GROANS] [HONK$] You're welcome. Now hurry. Get out of here before the giant comes. For us'? [HONKING] She will even give you and your friends a ride out of the castle. Benny and I have worked up a medley of Broadway favorites. No! That's it. Now, where did I put that bone-grinder? It's around here somewhere. [GASPS] I'll find it. Oh, Mr. Giant, I have a song I'd like to sing. Finally. An act with possibilities. [SINGING] I've got my blanket and my bear I'm ready for my nappy There's only one more thing I need. To make me happy Tell me a bedtime story. And I'll dream about you Magic, romance, fame and glory Any fairy tale will do Dishes with spoons and laughing dogs Beauties and beasts and kissing frogs Tell me a bedtime story. And I'll dream about you Tell me a bedtime story. You narrator, you Oh, I adore your oratory Our nightly rendezvous I don't wanna lie here counting sheep I'd rather hear Goldilocks.

To your Prince Charming Tell me about a bedtime story Tell me a bedtime story. And I'll dream about you I don't mean nightmares. And I'll dream about you [IN NORMAL VOICE] Good night now. Yeah! What? Hmm. Oh, dear. [SNIFFING] Fee-fi-fo-fat... ...I smell a boy, a mouse and a cat. So you're the famous Jack. [GASPS] Here after all this time... ...to slay the bad, old giant and take his treasure. You stole that treasure from them. GINORMOUS: What are gonna do about it, peewee? Heh. Wanna fight me for it? Well, come on, tough guy. Let's see what you got. How about this? No! [HARP PLAYS] [YELLING] [GROANING] Still wanna fight, peewee? Now, take it easy. Stay away from me! [SCREAMING] [ALL LAUGHING] Hey! [SOBBING] The bigger they are, the harder they bawl. [LAUGHING] Stop it, Tom. He's had enough. [GASPS] RED FAIRY: Oh, no. You broke the shrinking string. [GINORMOUS GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [LAUGHING] [JACK SCREAMING] Oh, no, you don't. Huh? [GROANS] [GROWLING] JACK: Head for the beanstalk. GINORMOUS: I'll smash you! Come on. Ugh. Come on.

[ALL GASPING] Wicked giant, I do banish Strum this harp and you shall vanish [GASPING] [LAUGHING] [GASPING] Are you gonna shape up? Or am I gonna start baking some bread around here? Hey, Ginormous. Huh? You want the egg? Come and get it. How dare you try to steal my egg. I'm coming for you, boy. [SCREAMS] [GRUNTING] Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Torn! Ha! Ginormous, if you let Tom go, I won't chop down this beanstalk. Don't threaten me, boy. I know where you come from, Jack. [GASPS] Just scurry along home. If you cross me, I'll grind your bones. I'll make some cat bread. And maybe some cute little mouse bread too. I'll grind the bones of everyone you ever cared about, Jack. Let's do it. Tom! Dragon-coaster drop! Whoa, whoa! [SCREAMING] Phew.

Magic harp, final tone Guide these heroes safely home [GROANS] Whoa, guys, I just had the craziest dream. You too? [CAR CRASHES] BIGLEY: Okay, somebody's getting sued. Mr. Bigley? I wanted to get an early start on the demolition. Only you left something in your parking lot that jacked up my car. That'll cost you. [GASPS] And that looks like... [SNIFFING] It is. Solid gold. There's gold on my property. [GRUNTING] Huh? Your property, Mr.Bigley? Says here you can't take ownership until 9 a.m... ...and never, if we pay off the mortgage. Oh, we still have five minutes. Allow us to present you with this lump of pure gold. It will pay off the mortgage, and cover the damage to your car. [YELPS] And the doctor bill for your foot. [GROANING] [SCREAMING] Jack, honey, what's going on? Mom, you know how Dad always said dreams come true if you believe? Well, we planted those beans and you'll never guess what happened. [MOM LAUGHING] NARRATOR". You can probably guess the rest. Jack and his morn saved Storybook Town and made it bigger and better than ever. You know the place. Just off old Route 66. Or is it 33? And as for Tom and Jerry? [PLAYING COUNTRY MUSIC] [CRASHING] NARRATOR". Well, they went right back ...to being Tom and Jerry. But that, folks, is another story.
