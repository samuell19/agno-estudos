The Afghan army is in Badakhshan. We don't trust the Arbakis and we are concerned. When do we start? Right now. We promised the to build a road to the village. It is good for us too because it facilitates access. Times have changed. Two days ago, they blew up a vehicle near Sakhel. You had enough motives not to return. I was called.

Please go to him and bring him to us. - Yeah. - Now. - Commander Haroon? - Yes My name is Tarik. The Germans are here. I am their translator. Where are they? Over there. These walls aren't very high. We should raise them. They were built by your soldiers. I understand. He says this is a good checkpoint. He says he has good men. I'm sure your men are good, very good Commander. But no one was here. We have to fix them. It is not necessary. Haroon, where would you like me to establish my area? Your place is there We need more space. A little more space would be good. This space is sufficient for you. He thinks this is the best position for you. Eat something Tarik! Tastes good. Thank you. I am sorry, forget it. There is no coverage in this area. Oh damn! I like your watch. Me too. This is my brother's watch. Are you here for the first time? No. The second time. Do you like it here? I guess so... That is a difficult question. Sometimes I have good days, sometimes I have bad days... Oh forget it Tarik. Please eat something yeah? As pthe future engineers of our country, you have to be aware: Here, bridges are much more than connections between places. Bridges mean hope for us. Girl come here Please come to work on time. Like everyone else! Understood? I'm sorry I'm late. The lessons at the university lasted longer. Shut your mouth! Save your explanation! Girls don't need college! You were raised wrong. If your father was still here would he be ashamed of you! You are a disgrace! Go! If my father was still alive, he would be a proud man. Because I'm studying! I don't want you to do that job. Quit. I'm afraid. Hello? Who's this? What do you want? Leave us alone! Nala. Nala! Nala! Promise me you'll stay here in the house until I come back. When will you be back? I don't know.

Teach your sons... fight for a united Afghanistan. And so... What did you say? He's putting us all in danger when he falls asleep stoned in the watchtower. Stop! Enough! Stop! Do not intervene! Commander! He doesn't want to intervene. He just wants to help. We don't need your help! Let's go. If you fall asleep at the watchtower, you put us all in danger. Do you understand, what I said? Don't neglect your responsibilities! Control yourself. Take, drink some. Do you want to talk to me? What can I do for you? Never do this again. This is not Germany, Captain. Sorry. We do not accept this kind of humiliation. Who are you to come to our country and tell us what is right or wrong. You are only here for a short time. Soon you'll be gone. Do you really think you understand Afghanistan? Your men respect you very much, Commander. But they would respect you even more if you would treat them, with mutual respect! Do you really think it's respectful to come to here with tanks and helicopters and impose your set of rules on us? Thanks. What was that? It wasn't a shot. Sorry - Are you ready? - Positive. Let's go, let's go! Come, come! Oli! Do something! - What? - Shoot! - Where? - What do you mean? Like in training, above the eyes. Obey the order! Brothers, they killed my cow.

You have to pay! The cow. he soldiers killed the cow he says. Sorry. The cow suffered. The cow ran into the barbed wire and broke its neck. We had to put her out of their suffering. Getting her out of the whole would have been useless. They shot the cow... because it would not have survived. They just wanted to help. That is forbidden. This is illegal. You can't just kill the cow. They say it was illegal. What was illegal? To kill it? Yes, it was illegal. What do you want to do? No, no. Tell me what they want us to do about he cow? What should they do about the cow? You can't just kill the cow. You have to pay for it. They say it's up to you. if you want, pay money for it. Money? How much is it? 25000 Afghans or 500 dollars.

To support the Arbakis is the priority. Over and out. Tarik? Tarik. OK Come on. Sit down. I bring you water. Drink a bit. Is it better? Yeah. Drink the water. The last time anyone did that for me was my father. I'm sure he would do better job than me. He is dead. They killed him. I was a teen. They made me stand and watch it. Why? Because he worked for the wrong side. What happened to your head? I got beaten. Why you got beaten? Because I am working for the wrong site. Because I'm a traitor. That's what they think. They say they will, kill us! I've asked for visa many times. The German government says, No! They say I need proof. What kind of proof? When I'm dead, is this proof? When my sister is dead? What is proof? I saw my father die my family has suffered a lot. But this is my country. Afghanistan is my home. If I felt safe here, I would never leave. We go outside, quick! Hurry up! They need your help. The village south from here was attacked. They lost one of their men. It's complete darkness. There is still enemy outside. We can't go out right now. He needs your help. You have to get him in. He has to be buried 24 hours after he died. Tell him I understand. But the risk for both of our men is too big. We can't go out right now. We were by your side. Are you now by ours? We helped you! All right. I will ask for illumination. OK, stop here. Pharaoh, here Bison. I need lights to support the Arbakis. Over. There is not support at this time. There is potential for collateral damage. Abort the mission immediately.. and move to the reconstruction tasks. Follow standard procedure. Do you understand? Over. Bison understood. Over and out. I just wanted lights! I'm sorry. Why don't you help us? I am sorry, it's not possible. You are not a soldier! You don't fight! It is not our intention to let you down. Let's go! The cowards aren't coming! They were told, you are allies, they expect you to be at yours side. Yes. I know. They are coming. Troops, salute! Why did you ignore direct orders and decided by yourself? You should have returned with your men. Your didn't ask for evacuation neither medical support. There will be consequences! Colonel, the translator Tarik, is being threatened. I ask you to report this urgently. Colonel, will you do it? Watch your language Captain. This is an embassy matter, not ours. Nala! Nala! Nala? Nala Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Take yours pants off! Commander Haroon, please give the money to the cow owner. Thank you Captain, on behalf of the village community. He thanks you. Your are welcome. Tell me why are you here. To protect the Afghan people. He says, do you have family? I had a brother. He died. Not very far from here. He lost two brothers in this war. Hate doesn't bring peace to your brothers' graves.

There is an old Afghan saying: You have the clock, but we have the time. 0-2 do you copy? Sorry. Vuelvo en un minuto. 0-2 copy. Commander, may I ask something important? My sister and I are being threatened. May I bring her here? Do you know a house where she can stay? Can she cook? Yes. Really? Yes, very well. But you are very thin. I'm not often at home. She can stay at my house while you're here. Thank you, Commander. It makes me very happy. How did he die? A VBIED It was a pickup car, filled of explosives. I miss him. Sometimes I ask myself, do we ever really make a difference? Or is it all just a fucking waste of it all? What's up? I need to get my sister. Please let me go. I promise, I'll be back soon. Thank you Captain. Quick, open the gate! What happened? Commander! Commander! Commander! - It's him. - Commander! Tarik come! He is a doctor. Come! Tarik what happened? They shot her. They shot her.
