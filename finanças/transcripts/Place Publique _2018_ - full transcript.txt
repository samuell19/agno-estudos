As someone used to say... I don't remember who was it. Whatever, someone said: "If at age 20 you are not a Communist then you have no heart.. "But if at age 30 you are not a Capitalist then you have no brains." It seems to me that it was Churchill who said that. - No, it's Jean d'Ormesson. - Jean d'Ormesson? - Is that so? - Yes, I think so. For 15 years, you've been hosting a show which became cult. Can we say that you are exploring the human soul? Yes, I think so. I have the feeling that people open up at my show more than anywhere else. I must say that you have the gift to ask direct questions, sometimes even very intimate ones. Yes, but, we hear a lot of double talk and politically correct in our day to day. I'm not interested in doing the same thing as everyone else. Yes, of course. You are now over 60 years old. How do you see yourself in 10-15 years? Uh... Cremated. It's time to move on to another musical break. - It's great, right? - Very. Wow. - I'm very happy with this car. - And it is good to drive. But be careful, you are going too fast. It is still in the break in period. There is no such thing. During the first 1,000 kilometers, you have to... Never-mind. You drive like you want. This was a long time ago. - Do you have a cigarette? - Yeah. - The guy is a bootlicker. - Yes. He is exaggerating. He is an hypocrite, and he does that with everyone. - Talking about your show... - Yeah. Exploring the human soul. Yeah, it was too much! He doesn't think too much. Assholes talking about their shit stories, Well, now it is you who is exaggerating. You said it yourself. But me, it's me. And you, it's you. - Vanessa told me she took a taxi. - Yeah. Vanessa confide in you, right? OK, should we go? If you just joined us, know that today we have a pleasure to receive Castro, who is staying with us for one hour. We were talking about the time that passes and I wanted to ask you, what is it for you to grow old? I would say, above all, reaching a certain serenity. From a certain age, we move away from unimportant things, we take a step back. We don't have to prove anything. Well, let's see. This constant anxiety, the fear of being judged. I don't worry anymore about what they say about me. That's the serenity I was talking about. Bullshit! Shit. I do not understand what the GPS says. Should I take the exit? Is this the exit? Shit, it was the other one. It doesn't matter, it will make another itinerary. Answer it. She is the woman from the organization. Hello? No, I'm not Hélène. No, she's driving. Yes. Okay. Okay. She asks if you have news about the show. I'm on my way to see Castro. I will call you after. - Okay. - Okay? Well, goodbye. I'm pretty sure he won't accept inviting my Afghan. You know what I think. Talking of your daughter, Nina Mareuil-Castro whose first book was unanimously acclaimed by critics. - That should make you proud, right? - Yes, of course. - It is the next... - Hush, he's talking about Nina. It's amazing for a father to realize that his child - has fully grown... - You missed it. Never-mind, turn right in 700 m. New tsunami alert... You are doing it on purpose? See you later! Sure we've been stagnating. But we manged to break the fall. Yes that's it. Yes, I agree. Now, there is a real problem, 8% is very low. The housewife is doing well. No, I agree. I agree. But you are not thinking of terminating the show? I say, you are not thinking of terminating the show? You can't do that to me. Let me a little... That's Horwitz? OK. You call me back when you know more, OK? Goodbye. He wants to stop? He must discuss it with the advertisers, it does not smell good. But they can't terminate him like that... They will be in a difficult situation... Castro is a pain in the ass too. He refuses to make any changes. I try to talk to him too, but he does not listen. Natalouch. Is it enough for a fire? - Lot of fire. Very good. - Yeah, that's fine. My sweetheart. - Are you OK, Titi? - Yeah. What's her name? Samantha. Samantha. Samantha. - Is it Biggistar? - Yes. - The blonde, who is she? - Nobody. What are you doing? I make olive skewers. I prefer that you serve the guests. Olives are fine like this, without skewer. Good idea to hire locals for the service. Frankly, she does not look smart. Don't worry, I will keep an eye on her. I remember, when she was on the 1st or 2nd year of high school, she had done a remarkable dissertation... Hello? Did you hung up? No, sorry. My father is inventing our past. It's funny. I haven't heard you right. Are you coming or not? No, we're going to talk about your books... Nobody cares about my books. Last time it was a signature. There will not be only celebrities. And when we get bored, we leave. Well... Yes, call me back. Amazing, when I saw that, I was... That's not true, is it Castro? It's not possible! It's Castro! Samantha? - You remember, I hired you. - Yes. - I hired you as... - Waitress. Yes, so the pictures... Well, what are you doing? Well, go serve! So? - It's good, she's coming. - Cool. - I'll introduce you to someone. - Yeah? Do you know BiggiStar? Of course. The idol of children. Sorry, I don't remember your names? - Lou. - Loulou. And you are Louloulou? And I am Guy. Ah, you hurt me. It seems that I have a good grip. - Thomas! - Nath. I'm glad you came. - I really loved your last movie. - Thank you. - This place is beautiful. - It is a paradise. It is only 35 minutes from Paris. Excuse me, can I have an autograph? 35min, seriously! It took us an hour and a half, at the very least. - You missed the exits... - It is far. I do not understand it. There is no more Parisian than my sister. Okay, the birds, the countryside, it is very nice, but... She is a city girl, Nathalie. She does not care about the countryside. She still has the house in Paris. Shit! Did I hit it? Yes, and it doesn't look good. Shit... - Nobody saw anything. - Yeah, but... It's okay. It's looks like the owner has a lot of money. Nothing happened. Are you not going to tell him? Yes, of course. I told you that I will talk to him! Tell me the truth, why can't you? Listen, it's... I invited you several times. You always refused. Nathalie and me love your work. We would love you to come. I don't know. I am not comfortable in shows like that. Shows like that? Like what? Where you talk about your private life. Oh no, but it is you who decide that. There's no need to talk about your divorce. How do you know that? I mean it is up yo you. It is really up to you. Maybe one of these days. I'm going for a drink. - How are you? - I'm fine thanks. It's been a while, no? Ah... Yeah. Do you remember me? Well, uh... He doesn't remember me. Excuse me, but where do we know each other? I worked on Like a Monday. Ah, I remember now. - Yeah, you do not remember me. - Well no. Sorry, but I don't remember you. So they are all celebrities. We worked a year together. What year was it? Like a Monday? - I do not know. In 1995? - 1996 Well, it's have been 20 years. Do you know the millions of people I have known since then? You look upset? So, did you like my surprise? Did he tell you that he lives next door? No, not that. This is Mrs. Chaulieu, the Mayoress of Saturnin. Sorry, who is Saturnin? I don't seem to remember anyone today. You are funny, we are talking about the village of Saturnin. And Mrs. Chaulieu is the Mayoress. Well, the Mayor. The Mayoress. I prefer "Mrs. Mayor". But whatever. As long as they don't call me alderman or bailiff, it's fine. - Nice to meet you. - I am glad. Me too. - Would you like a drink? - No thanks. Do you prefer a juice? Oh no, it's good, I'm not a guest. But you have the right to be thirsty. - What are you then? - I'm the driver. Castro's driver. Castro? I love him. I'm sure he's very nice. Is he? Yes. Very nice. I knew it. Do you think I can ask him to take a picture with me? Of course, he never says no. I love him. In real life, is he kind? It seems that he has a bad character sometimes. Maybe but... with me, it's going very well. So, he's nice in real life? Well yeah. Good. Sorry, I have to go. I have lots... That's fine. - Good luck. - Thank you. How are you? I'm Guy. Why don't you come over? We were... - Your daughter, not here? - No. That's odd. - Who's yours? - My daughter. - Pamela? - Yeah, she's not coming. Excuse me, can I take a picture with you? - It's for my mother, she loves you. - Yes. As long as it is for your mother, Damn! All these people asking me for pictures! Oh my God! Who's this asshole? You invited him to hurt people? - Guy? - He is a wonderful man. Wonderful? How so? His vision of the world, he doesn't play by the rules. - Very interesting. - What does he do? He is an organic farmer, he works right here. We clicked immediately. I take from him tomatoes, fresh onions, all organic. That's why he's wonderful? For his vegetables? Yes, but not only for that. He has a great philosophy of life. The taste of simple and authentic things. Do you know what he offered me on his arrival? - A honey jar. - Damn! He told me, "To bring sweetness in your house". Enough with your cynicism. What are they doing here? Hello, Mr. Delavenne. Hello Madam. Thanks for coming. Just for 5 min. - Of course, have a drink. - That's nice of you. - Hello. - Hello. Nathalie... Excuse me for a second. - Thank you. - Please. What he is doing here, Biggistar? - Do you have a project with him? - Kind of. Kind of? Wait, wait. My wife is in Bali. She will stay there for 2 weeks. In Bali? How lucky! She's staying with a friend who has a house there. - Hi, Jean-Luc. - How are you? What's up, Marie? - Were you invited? - No. I thought so. - What's she doing? - She is not moving for a while. - Who? - Vanessa. It was strange that you weren't with her. I myself don't even know if I'm with her or not. With this app, I can see the taxi. I see it on the map. She didn't move since 15 minutes. She's shopping, leave her alone. I do just that. You're too jealous for no reason. Take out the beef? Oh no, it is too early. The barbecue fire is fine Here is your sister with her masseur. - Another fool. - You're mean. I like Vincent. He's soft, he always says yes. Because of you, she wanted a conciliatory man. - It's beautiful, here. - And it's huge. - And very close to Paris. - Yes very close. Here is a fig tree. It is not big, but it will grow. What a good idea, a tree, there is none here. Maybe there are no fig trees. We heard you in the radio, you made us laugh. It was great when you were talking about getting old. What I was supposed to say? That I feel like shit, I want to cry? - No need to yell at me. - It's not me, it's you. I see you once a year and you attack me. Did I attacked him? I don't know, I was looking for the waitress. I don't see her. - How are you, Vincent? - How is the sciatic? - Do not start with that. - He's joking. Not at all. That's contempt, that's all. Hey, Hélène, a little humor. - He's joking. - That's all. It is fine, thank you. Big surprise! - Everything's fine? - Yes. - They play very well. - Yeah, not bad. I would have loved to be a guitarist. It's not too late. I tried. It hurts my fingers. Samantha! You scared me! You always scare me. I want to know who is in the meeting. Gigi will be there or not? Try to find out. 30 new animal species in danger of extinction. Holly cow! Cows, too? Ah... 8%, fucking. It does not get better! No. We're still doing better than the housewife. Of course. - Did Horwitz told you something? - No, nothing. 3 years ago, same thing happened to us, and then we did get up. How are you? - Fine and you? - Yes of course. - The castle is very beautiful. - 35 minutes from Paris. - That's incredible. - Hold on... Yes, yes... - Do you remember Marco? - And Lucien? Let's move! Come on, wake up There are only old people! You need to understand that it doesn't depend only on me. Things are not so simple. I know it's been a year, but it is the Region's decision. You need to understand that. You have authorized him to make a path. Did the Region agreed on that? We suffered during the construction works. - And the dust too. - This has nothing to do with that. The small path is under my responsibilities. Excuse me, I have to take it. - Another petition? - Yes! Another petition. When are you going to stop making petitions? When the world is perfect. I need to talk to you about something else... Did you read Nina's book? Yes, I loved it. More than the first. Did you? - Is there anything that shocked you? - Shocked? Damn! Is that Jean-Paul? Yes. I haven't seen him in twenty years. He just came back from Africa. - It is amazing what he does. - What? Organic vegetables? Organic vegetables? Not at all. He does humanitarian works. Do you know what he's doing right now? He distributes impregnated mosquito nets, in many villages in Africa from the west... or from the east. He received a prize from the Bill Gates Foundation. He did age too. Have I aged like that too? I dunno, I see you regularly. To me he didn't age so much. You know they offered me the Senior card, these motherfuckers? I don't understand. Thank you. Don't you realize that you are 65 years old? Everyday. I realize it... everyday. - And where is Vanessa? - She is coming. Actually, I don't know. - I'll look. - Huh? You know, I have an app where I see... Do you see Vanessa? ...I see the taxi's position. She is not far. Ah. Are you famous? No, I'm kinesiologist. - Apparently there are many celebrities. - But I don't have a TV. Oh? Oh ok. But you do have a car, right? When you live in the country, you have no choice. Of course. And uh... What car do you have? An old car that belonged to my mother. A R14. - A doe! - It's a deer. This morning, there was one at 2m in front of me. It was wonderful. How well it jumps! - Can I help you with something? - No, it's the waitress' job. She should take care of the buffet but I'm not seeing her doing anything. Doesn't that dog bark a lot? Jean-Paul, my hero! Hélène, I was looking for you. It's for you. I found the book you were looking for, it is this one, right? Thank you. - How nice of you. - No problem. It is hard to find L'horreur économique. I found it. I was glad. - Oh? - Yeah. So don't come. What do you want me to say? From the beginning, you did nothing but excuses, I'm tired of trying to convince you. Tell me just one more thing. At first, you said that you wanted to come. Stop saying you want to see me, it's not true. I do not know who you're fooling, yourself or me. I'm fed up. Bye! You know, the bookstore where I go. - Yes. Well, I was looking for this book and I come across Jean-Paul. It was a fluke! I didn't even know he was back. Paris is very small for those who love each other. - And so? - Well, nothing! He asked me out for a coffee. I said, "Why not." And then we saw each other, we had coffee. That's it. - What? - You make me laugh. - But why? - If you don't want to, don't tell me. What do you want me to tell you? Yes, I admire Jean-Paul. I think he's a good guy, it's nice to see him. And since he was always in love with you... ...shared pleasure and he found your book. Have you forgotten us? No, not at all. Did they offer you something to drink? Yes, but we wanted to know if the party would last a long time. We hear everything from our home. If it's going to last like this until... This is exceptional. And what about the day before yesterday? It was like this until midnight. - We work, we get up early. - Me too. - Is it really that noisy? - It's a valley. We'll be careful. But it's a party, we're not going to whisper. But we won't finish late. Do not worry. All right, let's go. - Are you going to sing something? - Sorry? Are you going to sing? Sing? Nope. Not now, maybe later. Well, see you later. You did make an album some time ago, right? Yes. - About 10 years ago? - That's correct. I think it didn't do very well. Yeah. It didn't seem so bad to me. Vanessa just called me, she is running late. Why is she calling you and not Me? She said you did not answer. I have my phone with me. - And why you? - Sometimes it doesn't work. There are many people who tell me they don't receive my calls. Excuse me, can I ask you for a favor? - A photo? - Yes. Thank you. Sorry. - You don't have to push me. - It's for the... Can we take one together? Thank you. - A little smile? - I'm smiling. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Thank you. Hey! What happened with the neighbors? They came to complain about the noise. What language does he speak? French. He is learning. And what did he say? "He came screaming about noise." Delavenne, he is never happy. He always complains about my vegetables. You are the one with the vegetables! In fact, I'm just outside Saturnin. Yeah. Who are you? I'm Nathalie's assistant. On TV? I don't have a TV. - Yes. - I don't have Internet either. Is it for a bet? No, by choice. I don't want to be told how bad it is, it scares me. And I must be afraid of everything. All this to sell advertising. It's not for me. Eh. Eh. And the Internet, all the morons who give their opinion, only insults and rumors... I take it all very seriously. That depresses me. Bronchitis? Oh no, it's pollen. Bronchitis? Has mom arrived? Yes, I saw her with Nathalie, I don't know where she is. - I heard you on the radio. - Thank you, I was a little embarrassed. I hadn't read your book, at that moment. So? - Did you finally read it? - Yes, I read it. - Tell me what you thought. - Well, good, very good. I preferred the first. If she could go to the show... To the show? - She almost never goes out. - She is afraid of being deported. - And she's Afghan? - Yes. It's a very touching story. But it is one of many. - So we should do nothing? - I didn't say that. You are contemptuous. - It reminds me of dad. - You've finished? This is something that matters to me. - And what do you want? - What I told you. - You want her to appear on the show? - Yes. No kidding, Hélène! Don't you see the guests of the show? What is your point? It's always the same people, always the same thing. Who sleeps with whom... You can create debate, it is not prohibited. If we educate people, they will appreciate it in the end. Stop with "Give them something else, they will watch it." You give them something else, they won't watch it. Interesting shows, nobody watches them. Because you flood them with mediocre content. Listen, ask him, propose him to create a debate. So at least he will laugh a little. The issue is not the guests. The show will end. It is not working anymore. - Really? - Yes, really. Oh shit. How does he take it? I didn't tell him, it is not sure yet. Oh, fuck. It's going to be a serious blow to his ego. - I feel sorry. - Me too. We created the show together. Where is Pamela? She's not coming, she has better things to do. What the fuck? And your teacher is always late. He's late everyday. Whatever is rain, snow or good weather. He's always late. I call him the SNCF teacher. Always late and who knows where he will takes you. And the gym teacher. He wears tracksuits and never plays sports. He could eat chips while you run. - It's funny. - Thank you. Is it on YouTube? Yes, it is. Are you successful? But where does he come from? - Yes Yes. - You must be living comfortably. Comfortably? Yes. For example, what car do you have? An Autolib. Come on, Let's go somewhere else. I dunno. - Nina! - Ah. - How are you? - Take this. Don't open it, I'll get embarrassed. And if you don't like it, you won't dare tell me, or you will get embarrassed too. How pretty you are. Come give me a kiss. - It's beautiful, here. - Only 35 minutes from Paris. - As the crow flies. - Stop with your as the crow flie! It took me 35 minutes to come. Want bronchitis? Uh... I didn't understand... Do you want a brochette? Oh no, thanks, Pavel. Good for health, bronchitis. I already have 11,000 signatures for Azadé. I'll show you the pictures we took. Yes, I'm fine, thank you, mom. By the way, when does your book comes out? In September. - I have read it. - I'm sure you did. I loved it, more than the first. - Didn't you come with someone? - In the end he will not come... What's up with dad? Is he angry? He spoke to me very coldly. It's the ratings, they are not good. Oh shit. Nina! Thanks for the invitation! - See you later? - Yes. Look. Look at the waitress, she does nothing. She takes pictures. She is at the show. Samantha? - Well done. - She is hot, right? Cut the crap, but... She has a provincial side... Who is this guy? He has 10 million views on the net. - But what does he do? - Nothing. Samantha! Samantha! - What's up with her? - Hey, it's my drink! Oh fuck. The boss is a pain in the ass. She doesn't leave me alone. But she's nice, don't worry. Who? You have to move a bit. Yes of course. Come meet Marie-Pierre. Who? Thanks, it's fantastic. I had to do it. We can't leave people... Yes, of course. - Would you like to sign? - Great, thank you. - We are not stars. - It's not a question of stars. Go ahead, I will sign. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome Madam! And good luck. I do it for pleasure. It is not a sacrifice. Sure, otherwise it would be a shame. I do not believe in sacrifices. People are firefighters or nurses because they like it. Of course. Are you married? Do you have children? No. And you? Sorry? I asked you if you are with someone? Yeah. With the woman who laughs with that guy. She is very giggly. Excuse me. This game is my calling. You're very good, I wouldn't reach that level. Well, there you are. Where were you? Sorry, I didn't bring anything. I came straight from a meeting. It's beautiful here. - And it's not far. - Yes, it's amazing. Excuse me. - Do you mind if I take a picture? - No, go ahead. You are my favorite Miss Weather. I quit three years ago. Even so, you are my favorite. So are you known too? What is this noise? It must be Bourdin. He is working all the time, He is really nice. Oh yeah? Are there any famous people that I know? - Did you come by car? - Yes. What type? Tesla S. How are you Pierre? Fine. There you are! I was looking for you. Well, I was here. - Have you seen Samantha? - No. You have taken too long. Yes. There was traffic. But what were you doing? I don't understand. What were you doing? There were traffic jams, it was not for pleasure. Traffic jam? You stayed 30 minutes at the same place? Are you still watching me with your taxi app? You're still bugging me with your app? What did you do for 30 minutes? Tell me. Tell me the truth, I'm not going to get mad. Well, okay. Do you remember what you told me? You told me: "If you are imagine a traditional family, forget it." - And you agreed. - Right. - And you were delighted. - I'm not saying no. But I can't stand your freedom. You prefer yours, of course. The thing is, we had a plan. Watching me like that all day, I will not stand it. - Are you threatening me? - No. No, I'm warning you. I don't want this life. Come on, darling. Okay. But... Why don't you want to tell me? What did you do for 30 minutes? Do you remember? That's crazy. MOTIVATED, MOTIVATED I've already been through that. It has no impact on him, this guy runs away. He is shady. I don't know what is wrong with him, he runs all the time. And I play the game, and I'm behind. No, we didn't sleep together. Not really, But... You are kidding, but it's exactly that. A smart girl is not exciting. But a fool who laughs? Well that one, yes, that one is fuckable. It was Baudelaire who said it, wasn't it? "Sleeping with an intelligent woman is a pederast's pleasure." it's Baudelaire. It is surprising, but it is so. Look, I'll have to hang up, but I'll call you back. Yeah, you too, kisses. How are you? I'm fine. Do you get bored a lot? No, I'm used to it How is my father? It seems that the rating are not... Yeah, that's right, they are not good, but he is thick-skinned. Yeah, I know. Go ahead, You do not have to make the conversation with me. I don't do it out of obligation. Why do you say that? What? It's the first time you talk to me since we have known each other. You don't have to. It's because I never had the opportunity. And now suddenly you figured out: "I'm going to talk to him." Isn't it because I've heard you and you are embarrassed? No. Let's talk then. MOTIVATED, MOTIVATED MOTIVATED, MOTIVATED Let's be motivated MOTIVATED, MOTIVATED I know everything. Everything? The car thing. The car? It's Castro's. Oh ok. Ah! Really? Well, it's not a big deal. Well, I do not know, we have to tell him. - Yes of course. - Bronchitis? Yes Thank you, Pavel. - It is a little hot. Do you want? - No thanks. Oh shit. He told you it is hot. He said to you: "It's a little hot" I thought that was the name of the dumpling? No, he said it was hot. Anyway, Pavel is very nice. He takes care of everything, it's amazing. He is helpful, he is... How lucky is my sister... ...because she's not easy to live with. - And his French has improved... - You are kidding. I really think so. I think he has progressed. Well, we agree, You will tell him before we leave. - Mmm. - What? Castro? Are you going to tell him? I have to talk to you. - Vanessa is here! - Yeah, she's here. - What's wrong? - Nothing. She has inconsistent schedules... I'm sure she has a lover. How funny. What is so funny? When we were together, you cheated on me and your conscience did not bother you. And you told me that I was obsessed. So it's funny. It is not the same. Men and women are different. Men are like that, women... How can you say that! In the end, it doesn't matter. I wanted to tell you, on your show, you invite people with amazing stories. Yeah. I know a woman with the most amazing story in the world. Is she the daughter of a famous person? - No. Does she sleep with a celebrity? No! It's an Afghan! They are about to deport her. If she returns to her country they will kill her. It's her own father who wants to kill her. Oh really? We need to talk with Nathalie. She takes care of the programming. I talked with her, she told me to talk with you. What has she told you? That it is not entertaining. Here is your answer. She also told me that the ratings are not very good. - This is the opportunity... - For it to get worse? No, not at all. I don't think that they will get worse. On the contrary. People would be surprised if you invited her. They would be very surprised, yes. That's crazy. It's crazy how you've changed. Do you no longer have convictions? Well, people evolve. - Do you call that evolving? - Well. How about how does Nina talk about us in her book? What do you mean? Well... She is destroying us! Have you read it? Is it because of the wig? Yes, because of the wig. And for you too. - Me? - Yes you. The lady who wants to save the world, who forgets to feed her children, who blames everyone and she is not responsible for anything. It's not you, isn't it? She is my grandmother. Who forgets to feed her children? Well, who doesn't take care of them, it is a way of speaking. I don't know it by heart. Well, I'm happy. I'm relieved. Because it's still a good formula. It's worth it... Yes. That's it. Thanks. I'm glad that we are in agreement... Yes. Bye. No, I understand. Bye, see you soon. We continue with the show, what's going on? They don't want Castro to continue. Well. And at the same time, he didn't want to change anything. How long does it took? Fifteen years? He already did his job. Don't be hard on yourself. Of course. She is Amazing. - Who? - Deveaux. She says: "the brochettes look good, it's a shame to not be invited" How does she know? Someone have uploaded a photo. It's crazy! It's Big Brother! Yes, but everyone consents to it, so it's not. Apparently there is a "doctor's face" But I could be the nurse that she has three words in total. They're idiots! Oh dear. Who produces? Blue Balloon. Blue Balloon? - Who do I know that works there? - No, please, leave it. Maybe I need to stop insisting so much. - Not at all, you're a good actress. - You have reasons to insist. - You say that because you love me. - Yes, that's right, But you're a good actress. We'll drink to forget. Everyone come! All of you! Come, come. Come on, come, gift! Gift! Your father told me that I was in your book. I didn't even notice. Yes well... Is it me, the irritating woman? And irresponsible? It is a caricature. - Come, gift! - What gifts? I don't have one! They are very rich and they still want presents! Come on, all! All of you! - Have you talked with Castro? - Yes. - So? - He changed the subject. - How elegant. - Elegant? He could have been furious, it would be expensive to repair that. - Ah, the car? - No, I didn't tell him. For you, Nathalie. I'd love for you to remember Happy days when we were friends Why does he insist on Yves Montand? Because no one told him that he doesn't imitate him so well. He laughed at me when I told him about my Afghan. It doesn't matter, he will no longer do the show. Oh? The show was cancelled? No. It wasn't cancelled, But it will continue without Castro. Shit. The dry leaves pile up Memories and also the regrets Will you still be working on the show? Yes, what do you want me to do? Oh, ok. - Why do you say it like that? - Nothing, okay. Do not blame me. Also, you don't know how this works. - Do not start. - Of course. I'm the retard who knits. Knitting? "The retard," it didn't bother you. Unbelievable. It's a song About us I loved you You loved me And we lived together You loved me I loved you But life separates those who love each other Slowly Quietly And the wind erases the steps off the sand The steps of lovers La, la, la, la La, la, la, la La, la, la, la La, la, la, la La, la, la, la La, la, la, la La, la, la, la La, la, la, la Hélènee! I have to talk to you. Get in here! Sit down, it won't take long. So now... I say speech, for Nathalie For a new house... ...and for love. First time I saw Nathalie... - ...I wash my motorcycle. - Sheep? I wash the bike. Nice bike... big Kawasaki 1200. Nathalie looked at the motorcycle... ...and rode. She grabs me tight... ...and I said to myself: "we could spend life like this". Because... ...I felt my heart... beating hard. But... but... Second time... But the second time... Nathalie didn't come. And I waited, waited! Do you want fire? No. You don't like speeches? It's not that. I'm just not comfortable there. But go ahead, don't feel obliged to talk to me. Love is not a country. Nathalie is Serbian... ...she is Italian. Get naked! Love is everything. Get naked! Are you gonna shut up or what? I was laughing, it is okay. Titi, calm down, okay? Make love, not war... Nathalie. My French is not good. But my love for you is good. Trust for life with you good. Forever. - How are you, do you mind? - No, no. It's not raining anymore, you can close your umbrella. Oh yeah. You don't want to come to my show but you do seduce my wife. - What? - Please stop. You missed a nice speech about love and trust. What are you talking about? Seducing your wife? I'm not seducing your wife. I'm seducing nobody. Are you okay? Vanessa, excuse me, but I... I'm sorry. What a gentleman! Bravo! - Come on! Come on, come on! - No, no, I do not want to. What are you thinking? That he is passionate by your intelligence? Not at all, I know those guys. He wasn't talking to you for the mere please of conversing. Meanwhile you were making faces the whole time. What are you doing? Texting while I'm talking to you? I'm calling a cab. So you can watch me with your app. Vanessa! - Do you still hear us? - The whole valley hears you. I didn't explain myself well before. I go to bed early. I work, I wake up early. - On Sunday? - There's no Sunday here. Animals do not sleep in. But I do have Sundays! I always had! I told you, it's exceptional, it's a house-warming. You come to my house as if you own the place, to tell me how I should live. Is this is your conception of a neighborhood. In a neighborhood, we should respect each other. - Who says so! - This is not Paris! You came here and you think that everything is permitted? Ah, I understand! That's your problem. If you are a countess, I am a baron. - What does it means? - It means what it means. You despise us, you do as you like. We can't say nothing. One day, we will take care of of you. You will laugh less. On that day, cut off my head first. In the meantime, get out of my house. - Is there a problem? - Yeah, there's a problem! She will explain to you. What's his problem? Who cares. What a nice speech! Are you okay? Do you need anything? Yes, in fact, I wanted to talk to you because... Well, it's hard to say. It is a somewhat delicate subject. I thought it won't happen again, But, I am in love. It's nonsense. Love is never silly. Well, it's not easy to say. You'll be surprised. Go ahead and tell me. In fact, you know her. You have known her forever. It's Pamela. Pamela? Nathalie's daughter. - But she's 20 years old. - 21, but... I know it already. It's ridiculous, I told her a thousand times. And... Believe me, I have resisted a lot. At one point, I thought: "It's absurd. We are really good together." But I tried to resist. Well, you've been a hero. You can make fun of me, but... Finally, I am in love. She didn't come because she want me to tell Nathalie. But it is not easy. And me? I thought you would understand. Vanessa! Don't go like this. I can't stand that guy... he is a showoff, a snob. Good evening. - And I saw you dancing with him. - I danced with him and with everyone. You behaved like a mental patient. It is a shame! - I'm sorry. - No, you're not sorry! You will start doing it again. - You could try to understand me. - I'm not that smart. Oh, Vanessa. I was saying... Vanessa. Are you okay? You know, it's very caricatural. You just inspired me. I never forgot to feed you. I was sick. Depression is an illness. Damn... - You don't forgive anything. - Who? You children! I didn't mean to say that. I wanted to talk about those who always are so human and so supportive... So what? But is it bad being human and caring? Is it better to be selfish or sleep with 20 year old girls? - Who's sleeping with 20-year-old girls? - Nobody. Okay. I meant it's simpler with cynics people. Look at dad, everyone knows he is egocentric, but he doesn't pretend to be generous so we are not disappointed. That's it. "Be an asshole from the start, and you won't get blamed for anything." I don't know what I did, so that my daughter does not believe in anything... Who doesn't vote. I don't vote because they force me. They also forced me to choose between the two of you... between your naive optimism and Dad's absolute cynicism. And it doesn't matter one or the other, it's the same. And who invented social security? Your father or me? What does it mean? You know very well. - What have you done to the car? - What... The front, it is damaged. Do not play the fool! No way! Do you think I'm an idiot? I'm getting sick of you. You can't take your eyes off the car. - I do not understand... - Do you use it in your spare time? - Sometimes, but... - Well, I'm done. You take too many liberties, because I'm nice. You do like you want. If it's not the car, it's your way of speaking. - My way of speaking? - Yes! You give me your opinion about my show. "Imbeciles talking about their sexual anecdotes." But who do you think you are? You think you have the right to give me your opinion? To laugh with my wife? To take the car whenever you want? Go think somewhere else... It's over, I don't need you anymore. - You are firing me? - Exactly. You've understood everything. This ends right now. Now? Yes, now. Do you want me to say it in Latin? - But I didn't do anything to your car... - Yes, of course. And how do I get back? And what do I know, you will figure it out. But don't touch the car. Give me the keys. Give me the keys. Thank you. Damn. And to think I called him my hero... That's disgusting. Disgusting. He left with his tail between his legs. Anyway... Now you understand me. The dog will keep bothering us for a long time? Excuse me, do you know who goes to Paris? No, I do not know. Why? I just don't know how to get back. I am looking for a car. I can ask if you want. - Well yes, thank you. - Samantha! I must go. He won't leave me alone. Hep. Oh sorry. Ah, well, here you are. You can add it to your book: "The smooth-talker with a wig... cynically selling his junk and manipulating with delight manipulable people." "And who takes coke on occasion." Do you know it by heart? I am so touched by your love for me. It's very touching. It's just a character, it's not exactly you. It doesn't matter to me. This coke is shit It is bad. Where is Vanessa? Where is Vanessa? I'm gonna tell you. Vanessa is... She is in Champerret, What is she doing there? That, I can't tell you. But she does what she wants. She's free. She goes wherever she wants. Vanessa is independent. Why don't you take off the wig story? Dad... It's my private life, damn it! You are exposing it to the public. It's incredible! You spend your time spreading people's life. You got some nerve! - I do it with their consent. - Their consent? You manipulate them, you even force them to drink... ...to make them talk. You told me that! People who would say anything to be on TV. Damn it's just a word! Does it bother you that much? You don't care! People will know it's me! They know you're my daughter. Why do you think they read your books? Why do think you got published? Because of your talent? There are 200 girls who can write like you! You got your book published because you wear my name. I just saw the car... Someone hit it while parking. It was not damaged before. I don't care, I know how to drive. I don't need a driver anymore. I count on you. He fired you, right? Yeah. You have lasted longer than the others. I'm leaving, I have nothing to do here. - Are you going back to Paris? - Yes. Can I go with you? Yes, of course. Are you okay? Are you drank? It is not that. I can't breathe. It's nothing, do not worry. Put your hands like this. Come on, put your hands like this. It's a panic attack. Put your hands like this. Breathe. Breathe slowly. Continue. There you go. Again and again. Do you know why Pamela isn't here? Because she sleeps with Jean-Paul. Oh ok. Does it amuse you? Not at all. It's just... Nothing. Well, what is it? - Nothing. - But tell me, what? I saw you dance, you were very beautiful and... I thought I could lose you suddenly. That's nonsense. - Are you leaving? - Yes, I get up very early. Here, we do it three times. One, two... and three. The karaoke was a bad idea. - It's her. Who is she? - My accountant. I'll bring radishes tomorrow. Here you are! Where is Abbé Pierre? Who is Abbé Pierre? Jean-Paul. I throw him out. - You throw him out? - I made him understand... You know why Pamela is not here? - Because she is with Jean-Paul. - What do you mean? They are sleeping together. Stop. It disgusting. It's not possible. Damn the dog! Sacred Jean Paul. - That makes you laugh? - It is awful. Awful! It's okay! She is an adult, he didn't force her. He saw her born, he had known her since she was a little girl. Of course, for you it is normal! Do you want him to sleep with women of your age? A young woman is sexier. Yes, I find it normal. Youth is beautiful. And old age is... - It's depressing, that's all. - Speak for yourself. You say it as if she were a universal law. I don't even know what I would say to a 20 years old girls. You don't have to talk about anything! Youth is sexy, damn it! Do not be an hypocrite! I'm not a hypocrite, I'm serious. Nice that you think like that. That's exactly why Horwitz want to replace you. I didn't know how to tell you, but since you seem to understand it so well... The show continue but with someone younger. I don't believe that people get punished. My father have been a bad person for 30 years, and nothing happened to him. Your trick works fine. One of my exes had panic attacks... She did that every time. A very smart girl. I don't dislike smart girls. Oh, and Kamel? Is he nice? Very nice. And Alain Poly, how is he? - Is he nice? - Very nice too. And the one who plays at Les Bailereaux? - He's nice too. - They are all very nice. - Oh. - You are leaving? Yeah, it's late. Shall I give you my phone? I'll manage without it. What do you mean? Well, write me on Facebook, BiggiStar. Subscribe to my page. Write me. Guys, come on, let's go, I'm tired. Ah, the idol of the old. No way! Not at all. I am the idol of young people, and you, of the old. It is funny! "They brag of a rather weak advantage, and their age stands out a lot." What is he saying? It's from Moliere. An antiquated from the XVII. The century, not the district. Mister takes me for an idiot. It reassures him. Not for an idiot, But I tell it to someone who he is adored by assholes from the Internet. Be more modest. Your audience are people with Nobel prizes? No, but they are no longer in primary school. It pisses you off that I'm successful. I don't care if you're successful, I don't know you. You only know how to brag of being young... ...but it's going to happen to you very fast. That's what the wig is for, isn't it? So it doesn't happen so fast. Are you crazy? Fuck, you sick! Yeah, I'm sick! Yeah, I'm sick! Come come! He's sick. He's fine, he has nothing. He got slapped... It's not okay! Yeah, yeah. It's okay, calm down! You're done. Yeah, I'm done, yeah! Mind your business, asshole. You can not say that Pavel! Yes, but for me... For me too many immigrants is not good. They do drugs, robberies... You are an immigrant but you are not a thief. No, but it doesn't apply for me. I work right away, I'm always good. Not the same. So you don't want to sign? Of course I'll sign it. I don't get it, but... Here. Thanks, Pavel. Thank you. I hurt my wrist. You did not have to... Don't substitute me for that asshole. BiggieStar, what an idiot name. No way. I'm going to do a program for young people. Anyway, things end... It's like that. I can always do a shopping program. - It's not funny. - It is not supposed to be funny. You'll get out of this. You'll have a thousand proposals. Do not fool yourself. I have no proposals. It is no longer like that. We have until the end of the season, we will make beautiful shows. There's nothing to lose anymore, will you invite Azade? - Who? - The Afghan. No, Hélène, don't start with that. I'll see what Pavel is doing. Does she have good shit? You are despicable. No, seriously, damn it! What will she do in my show? Do you think that interests the public? The public is tired of the misery, he wants bread and games! Sure, that's it. That's it. Let the weak die! Exactly. It has always been that way. There are lions and there are gazelles. Strong and weak. It will always be like this, whether you like it or not. I have no faith in human nature, not like you. It's politically incorrect, but it's like that. Leave it alone. He is right. What would Azade do on that shitty show? Shit show? Excuse me, this "politically incorrect" show. OK, let's go? By the way, we have damaged your car while parking. Wait, wait a second. Damn, let's go! What are you doing, Jean-Luc? Guys, guys, oh! He has a shotgun! What's happening? What is he doing with a shotgun? He is crazy! Mr. Delavenne. Look out! Pavel! Calm down. It's all good. It's all good. Relax. The party is over. ... I didn't do that to the car! No not at all. Do you often have anger attacks, like that? No, it's the first time. Goodness. Are you angry with me? No, strangely. I don't know what I feel, really. Your father is doing a massacre on the Internet. What an idiot! Horwitz? Fuck you! Yes? Yes, I have. How? No, it seems very good to me. I am glad. Okay, see you tomorrow. There is no light in the hallway. It was Horwitz. I love this job. The fight between Castro and BiggiStar was such a success on the Internet... ...and like magic, Castro has regained his charm. I do not understand. He will be back on the show? Horwitz hopes so. Castro still has much to say. He is not finished. My little vane. Why do you say that? For nothing. I think I won't last long in this house. Why? Well... I'm going to kill the dog. Then we'll see. Oh dear.
