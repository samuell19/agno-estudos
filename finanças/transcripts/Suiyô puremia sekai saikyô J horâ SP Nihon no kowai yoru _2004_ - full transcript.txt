All those for Twilight Cemetery this is your stop. Would you like to hear a scary tale? Would you like to hear a scary tale? No... Would you like to hear a scary tale? It starts on a dark, lonely night, just like tonight... A solitary bus on a mountain road, without a soul on board... In the middle of the night... the bus travels on its route a girl is waiting... at the bus stop. The bus driver stops, but no one gets on. He closes the door, perplexed, and continues down the lonely road. Suddenly... a small high-pitched voice cries out, "Let me off"! He looks in the rear view mirror, and there behind him... a doll, like this, is sitting there. "Let me off"! How about you? Would you like to hear a scary tale? (Japan Horror TV) (Japan Horror TV) (DARK TALES OF JAPAN) Have you heard of the turbo-hag? Turbo-hag? Not me. I have... Drivers see her in the dead of night. You see an old lady hobbling down the road... And if you pass her by... She comes after you? Yeah! At lightening speed! Is she on skates? No, turbo jets! She comes right up... to your window, And if you look at her, you die... Yeah! That's like the man-dog. And the headless rider. The man-dog is scarier. You're a wimp. Hey... what's that? The turbo-hag? No way! We ARE driving in the dead of night. Oh my God, what is that?! It's coming after us! Hurry! Get out of here! (The Spiderwoman) So that's the turbo-hag? I don't no. Maybe it was the man-dog. But it had 8 legs, right? So it can't be a dog. But its face is human. That's so creepy! When did this happen? I don't no. It was this year, right? Yeah this year. Maybe last month? So the driver smashed into... the guard rail, and they all died. So who did you hear this from? What's this? The report on that beast... that crawls on the road I know, but what's this ending? Like most urban legends, there is no hard evidence... But you know there are no eye-witnesses. Yeah, I know But we're not a science journal, see? Just say the Spiderwoman exists, OK? If you say so. And this title's too long... The Four Legged Creature Can't you make it shorter? Like Man-Dog, or Turbo-Hag? (I saw her too!) (The Spiderwoman strikes again) (Eye-witnesses all over Japan!) I had to work late that night, so I went home at midnight. and I was walking alone... in a quiet alley. I distinctly felt I was being followed. I fainted on the spot... and awoke the next morning. Was it the Spiderwoman? Who knows... Look at this response! Sales are up 20%. Here... more mail. Let's run 8 pages this week. Get to it! What if she really exists... I'd totally freak out... Sure she exists... These are all eye-witnesses. I really don't like this... Just read them! From what I hear, a long time ago... there was a woman who hated spiders. Spiders are actually useful creatures... that eat other insects for us. Then one night... the curse of all the spiders she killed turned her into a Spiderwoman. The Spiderwoman is normal by day. But at sundown... She always runs off on all fours without paying. The Spiderwoman wraps her victims in her sticky web Her victims become spiders... like her, or are wrapped up... and killed. I heard she prefers... people with big eyes. Your eyes are REALLY big! Cut it out... I'm really freaking out. Relax, You can protect yourself from the Spiderwoman. To protect yourself from the Spiderwoman, you say Spider wasp, Spider wasp... The Spider wasp is a natural enemy, that preys and feeds upon spiders. Spider wasp We can make use of this. Hey, why is this pile so big? Easier to sort this way? I'm sorting by address. They're all from this one area. You're right. This one too. Don't you get it? That's where the Spiderwoman must be. You're right! That's freaky! What if it's true? Go check it out tomorrow. No, please... I really don't like this. The Spiderwoman often appears in Kamiya City around the bypass at the Shimoota Tunnel. My friend was attacked there too. (Following the tracks of the Spiderwoman) (Our reporter goes directly to the source!) What's with the blanks? Hasegawa's gone to cover the story but we can't reach him. the number you dialed cannot be reached now... What's he doing? What are you doing? Go find him. If you get back by tonight, we can still meet the deadline! Right. We just told that guy yesterday. Yeah, his name was Hasegawa. So how often does this Spiderwoman show up? I've only seen her once. What's she like? Her clothes are outdated... her shoes are worn... Her stockings are all torn... She reads racing forms. She eats and runs, right? On all fours? I think so... You mean you haven't seen her? She came in after our shift... Who saw her then? Someone on the late shift? Or a customer, maybe? That's what I thought. She always orders mushroom pasta. And brings her own hot sauce. Hot sauce? She really pours it on too. She dumps half of it in. even in her soup. The soup turns totally red. She always sits right there... Oh, my God. Is that her? I need a receipt please. Just a minute, ma'am. See? She's paying... (Spiderwoman, please leave us alone.) Hi... Is she for real? Yes. Was someone attacked here? Yes. Really? Really. Have you seen her? No... not exactly... I thought so... But... my friend was really attacked. So YOU wrote that letter. The police didn't take us seriously. Anyone home? We can come back later. Akemi? It's OK. Come in. OK, then. Hi, Akemi. How are you feeling? Hi. Here. I brought you notes from this semester. This is English, and this is Math. Don't worry, Akemi. He's all right. She's mad because no one believes her. Akemi, He's a reporter. He'll listen to you. So tell him... what happened. Thanks. I was coming home late... from school, I usually don't take that road, But I was in a rush that day so I rode my bike and... I heard some strange footsteps. So I looked behind me and... There was this woman but she was still far away so I didn't think anything... But still, I sensed something strange. Wait! Can you slow down? Because she keeps a distance with me, I felt even stranger... Relax, Akemi... Slower. OK, so... You were coming home late, right? And then? A woman was walking way behind me and I didn't think anything of it. But she never got any closer, I felt strange and then... she got down on all fours and... approached really quickly. She opened her mouth real wide... she had 8 eyes and 8 legs and... She wrapped me up in her web and I couldn't move a muscle I was so scared so I wanted to scream but my mouth was full of thread... I couldn't even move, so I fainted... when I woke up, I was covered and was wrapped up like a mummy and I was hanging from the ceiling I was upside down and couldn't move so... I struggled and struggled but... I couldn't open my mouth because I was covered in this thread and... I was totally freaked out... The area was deserted, really frightened... What are you doing? Oh. We were just visiting. Who are you? My name is Yamazaki... from Mademoiselle magazine. It's about your daughter. What about her? Was it last month? About her accident last month. What do you want to know? I just came to give Akemi her notes. Thank you. Bye then. She's still in a state of shock. The doctor says she shouldn't be around strangers. Oh, sorry. Please don't mind me, I'm leaving soon. I have to go. Thank you, but I really have to go. No slippers! How rude of me. Dont bother... Here. Thanks. I see you buy our magazine... So... what do you think of Akemi's story? About... The Spiderwoman? Yes. This story here. This attacked her? Yes. I don't believe it. Me neither... She's really a problem... I'm hardly ever home so, I think she's quite lonely. Her father? He died... before she was born. Sorry... Did you draw this picture? No, we have illustrators... I really can't draw. Sorry, I'm so ignor ant. I've never even left this town... No, it's fine. I can't draw... to save my life. Spiders are cruel... Do you know their mating habits? No... The female spider is much larger than the male. After they mate, she eats him. Isn't that awful? Isn't that the praying mantis? I said spiders. I'm talking about spiders. Oh, sorry... Praying mantises may also do that, but some types of spiders do too. Yeah... The Spiderwoman is normal by day. But at sundown... I'll be going now... I'm freaking out... I don't like this... Please stop... I'm freaking out... Hasegawa... I'm freaking out... I don't like this. Please stop... I'm freaking out... I don't like this. Please stop... I'm freaking out... I don't like this. Please stop... The female spider is much larger than the male. After they mate, she eats him... Isn't that awful? Spider wasp! Spider wasp... I told you the Spiderwoman was real... Have you heard of the turbo-hag? Turbo-hag? Not me. I have... Drivers see her in the dead of night. Is she on skates? No, turbo jets! She comes right up... to your window. And if you look at her, you die... Yeah! Hey... what's that! The turbo-hag? No way! We ARE driving in the dead of night... Oh, my God, what is that?! Hurry! Get out of here! (DARK TALES OF JAPAN) At first, I thought... Mr. Shimizu was just on the road again, but he was late on his rent. He's never been late on his rent. It's been 3 months now, so I knew something was wrong. So you called me? He had you down... as his guarantor. Mr. Kodera... Are you a writer too? No, just friends from high school. I haven't touched a thing. I left it just as it was. Don't be shocked. Shocked? You'll see... What the... I told you so. What possesses someone to do this? Black magic or something? (Crevices) Is it OK if I look around? Go ahead. I'll be watching TV. I'm being watched... I'm being watched... I'm being watched... I'm being watched... What the heck? I guess he's not just on the road. Is it so? I just helped myself. I'm parched. You want one? No... Manager. Did Shimizu say anything? Like he was going somewhere? Not that I recall. He usually... lets me know but... Did he say he was... expecting someone? Manager? Manager? It can't be... Where? Where are you? You won't defeat me! Come out so I can film you, Where are you? This is my house... Show yourself! Damn it! This should do it. Go... away! Stop! Noooooo! What was that? What?! Crevices... Where is it? I've taped you all up... Crevices... crevices... crevices... Nooooooo! (DARK TALES OF JAPAN) One humid night, When I was young, I saw the strangest thing... I only truly understood it when l got older, and had that terrible experience. Grandma? (The Sacrifice) I grew up and left home to live and work in Tokyo. Morning, Mayu. Hi, Reiko. You're early as usual. That was there since this morning. Present from a secret admirer? I doubt it. What is that? Mayu... I was wondering... what if... Did Fukuda ask you out? I knew it! What happened? He called me over after work, and asked if I'd go out with him. I knew it! But I said sorry... and he just left. Fukuda was turned down by another girl in Accounting too. Really? You mean Yamamoto? But she... Yeah, she quit. You know what Fukuda said when she turned him down? What? I'll put a curse on you! It's just a rumor... but it was right after that she stopped showing up for work. So what if that gift this morning... Reiko, there he is! It's Fukuda! Oh no... Hello? Miss Ooki. Good morning. I found a mistake. Please correct it. My mother suddenly fell ill, so I returned home. I'm home! Welcome home! How's mom? I'm home. Mayu, it's you. Hey, don't get up... I'm fine, I'm sorry. I got so busy with work, I'm just tired. That's OK. I needed a break. Right. I needed a break too. Did you go pray to the ancestors? Dad? Did you know when I was little, this room gave me the creeps? Did it really? I saw a big... monstrous head in here. Just a head? I saw it the night... before grandma died. That's why this room always scared me. I remember... That was a terrible night. Mom was in the hospital. She was? Yeah, it was that night, when her condition suddenly turned for the worse I was worried sick, but she pulled through. I didn't even know. The next morning, we found grandma dead in her bed. I was shocked. There was a bond between them... As if grandma died in mom's place. You again? You take care of your mom, before it's too late. You'd better go home. She's going to die for you! Don't talk like that! Grandma! It's coming... real soon! Grandma, be quiet! Grandma! Sorry. She snuck out again. She's getting senile. Let's go home! Look! There it is!! (Chanting) Dad? How long has she been chanting? She needs to rest. I know, but she won't listen to me. Mom, you need to rest. I'm fine. Mom, you'll get sick! I'm fine. (Chanting) Mom, Mayu's going back to Tokyo. So soon? I have to take care of something, but I'll be back tonight. All right. (Chanting) (#105 Fukuda) Fukuda was turned down by another girl in Accounting... (General Affairs - Mayu Ooki) She was chanting again. Then she felt sick, and went to bed. The local doctor came, but he just said... she needed to rest. Let's take her to a proper hospital tomorrow. You're right. That night was a humid night, like the one in my childhood. (Chanting) It's coming soon! It's coming! (Chanting) Mom... I woke up in my own bed the following morning. My arm had healed... The stain on the ceiling was gone. And then... Mom. Mom. Mom! Wake up! How come... Mom! Get up, mom! At about the same time my mom passed away, Fukuda took his last breath in Tokyo. I quit my job and returned home. Grandma died in place of my mom, and mom saved me from Fukuda's curse. At least that's what I believe... (DARK TALES OF JAPAN) Who is that woman looking at you... from the last row? I'd say she's 27 or 28 years old... wearing a red suit... She's pale and thin. Quite pretty. Is she there again? Who is she to you? She's been stalking me for years. Since the first time I saw her, she's been sitting in the last row. She's pretty and with that red suit... I was interested at first... But she started shaking... the seat in front of her. I thought she was drunk, so I went over and said, Are you OK? Fool! Yes, I know. As soon as I spoke, she said Damn! and disappeared. At this rate, she'll end up killing you. What? Don't worry, I'll go talk to her. She understood. You won't see her again. Yes! The Land of the Free! Hey, driver. Hollywood! This is Hollywood, right? But it's sure going downhill, huh? It's all reruns lately, right? All reruns and... Japanese horror flicks. What do you call those again? Remakes. Remake... the Movie, right? What about that, huh? What do you make of that? Oh, no! Is she free too? L.A. - where the blondes... are the real thing! Not like in Tokyo with the Blondie-wanna-be's This is the real deal! This is the real deal! Yes, native, native. Man, I'm getting excited! Yes, this is Ishiguro. I just arrived. Yes, I meant good morning. Nope, no problems. Everything's great. Yes, sir. Excuse me. I'll go see the clients tomorrow, at 9 sharp. Yes, yes sir. Got it. No, just a bit of jet lag. Whose house is this again? Executive Director Hirata? And his girlfriend? They're on a vacation together? Wow, what a life... I wish I were a Executive Director. No, nothing, sir. Got it. Bye. I got it. Had to be a blonde. I knew it! Damn! Stop... I said cut it out... Stop it... Boss? No, nothing, sir. The Executive Director killed himself?! Why? Wasn't he on vacation with the blonde? Yes, right away, sir. I'll move to a hotel right now. No... don't tell me... No jokes, OK? Blondie!!! (DARK TALES OF JAPAN) You're working late, Fukawa. You don't look so good. No, I'm fine. I'm off from tomorrow so... I'm making a list of the delinquencies. You're going to make calls while you're on your vacation? (Presentiment) This is Fukawa. I can't answer the phone. Please leave a message. Hello? We just arrived at the hotel. You'll be here by tomorrow morning? Mitsuko is waiting for you, so hurry up. Daddy! I can see the ocean from our room! I can't wait to see you. (Accessing database) This is Fukawa. I can't answer the phone. Please leave a m essage. Hi, it's me. Are you really coming? I'll wait for you. I trust you. I'll be waiting for you on Platform 9. 7:49 is the last train. If you don't come by then, I'll kill myself. I'll throw myself... on the tracks. What is this? Our client files... have been copied. Really? The last user of the file... swears he didn't copy it. There's no one... on security film either. Our firm is based on confidentiality. If our client data is stolen, we're finished! Who did this? We think... Fukawa was the only one... in the office at the time. Call Fukawa, now! But he's on vacation... Vacation?! He's not at home? Where's his family? This is his wife. He was supposed to... meet us yesterday, but he never showed up. Where could he be? Daddy! Where are you?! Daddy! Fukawa stole a list of information on loan outstandings of 300,000 clients. If it falls into... the wrong hands, that list could be worth anywhere from 5 to 10 million yen. Fukawa stole it. This is a criminal offense. Call the police. We have to find him! Damn! You wanted to go down? What? You were going down? Yes. I always do that. I go up instead of down... Then go down instead of up... (Harumi) I'm almost there. Really? Where are you? Still at work. Liar! You aren't coming. I swear, I'm leaving now. Are you ashamed? Are you ashamed of me? Don't whisper! I'm not! Yes you are... If I were your wife or daughter, you wouldn't be whispering. No, I'm in an elevator. (Out of range) Great. The power's out. Just great, huh? You're going on a trip? Yes... We're on a trip too. That's nice. (Out of range) How cute! Your daughter? Yes... How old? Five. Five... Is your daughter going with you? Yeah. That's too bad. Huh? You must adore her, your daughter. Yes, I do... Loving someone... is one of life's greatest joys, but it can also cause much pain. Because you... have to part some time... Must you talk about that now? At this time? What meaning would it have to him now? I'm sorry. We lost our second child when she was quite young and... I'm sorry... But we're together now. What? Together in spirit, she means... (Harumi) Where are you now? Still at work... I knew it! You'll never leave your family! No! I'm stuck in an elevator! I'm killing myself! Don't forget. The last train is at 7:49. That's it. I'll never make it. Not the 7:49. I'll curse you... if you don't come. I'll curse you and your whole family! Stop talking about curses already! Listen to me... Hello? Crap! No power... Who's going to curse you? Nothing. That's not something you should say... Dead or alive... Does anyone have a cell phone? Please, someone must have one. Don't you? Have a cell phone? No. You're kidding. In this day and age? You must be joking. Please lend it to me. I really don't have one. I have no use for a cell phone. Just wait. There's plenty of time. Don't panic. For you, maybe, but not for me. What's the rush? Rush? You like being trapped in here? Whoever trapped in the lift... should panic! The 7:49 train? I don't care! Just give me a phone! You'll never make the 7:49. You look like you care... like you're going somewhere... Let's get out of here. Yes, I do have plans but... I don't need to go anywhere. Anyone there? Please respond! Yes! We're trapped in here! We've been stuck here for an hour! I can't hear you well. 2 men and 2 women. 4 of us are stuck in here! Please pick up the receiver. The receiver? What the... I can hear you clearly now. What's going on? What do you mean? It's hot in here! We're dehydrated and exhausted. We'll be there shortly. In about 30 minutes. 30 minutes? You mean you're not in the building? We are a maintenance company. We're being dispatched... by the building and... Fine, fine. Just get us out of here. I can't waste any more time in here. Excuse me, but... What is it? Did you say... there were 2 men and 2 women? Yes, 2 men and 2 women. In another elevator? No, in this box here! There are 4 of us. I'm the only one talking but there are 3 others... You're the only one in there. We only see you. What are you talking about? Please calm down. We can see... with our security cameras. And the only person we see... is you. There is no one else. Please calm down. We're almost there. You'll be out soon. Just close your eyes and relax. Let's just wait. Something in life... You can't fight it. You just have to accept it. Stop it... You'll see your daughter again. Yes, one day... you'll see her. What are you talking about??? Don't worry. It's one long journey. It may end here, but it starts anew. Stop it! Please stop this. Help me. I'm sorry! I won't do it again, I'll never steal again. Please don't! I don't want to see this. I won't do it again, I promise. I won't ever steal again. It's not because of what you've done. Mr. Fukawa! Mr. Fukawa! Yes! It's me! Is it you? Mr. Shigenori Fukawa? You're the only one still in the building. Yes, that's right. I'm Shigenori Fukawa. We're right here. Please calm down. OK, just help me, quick! Calm down! We're pulling up the cable manually. When it reaches the 17th floor, we'll get you out. Stop! Stop it! Stop looking at me! Stop it! Don't look at me!!! Hurry! Hurry! Hold on! We're here! You made it, Mr. Fukawa. Are you OK? Are you all right? I'm saved. Can't you see them? See what? There, in the elevator. 3 of them... Of course... there's no one there. Are you claustrophobic? No. Some people hallucinate when they panic. Hallucinate? Mr. Fukawa, let's get you to a hospital for some tests. Are you kidding? I'm perfectly sane. I'm not hallucinating... Please listen to us, Mr. Fukawa. Let's go. Shut up! You trapped me in there! Hallucinations? Could it be? I should never... have done this. I'll kill myself, if you don't come. 7:49 is the last train. My life is over... What would you like to order? Can you see them? Who? An old couple and... a young woman. See? Across the street? No! Right there! Please excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. The timing on death is sometimes a bit off, there's a lag effect. But his death by a broken cable... is right on schedule... Just about now... But through death, we experience life. I'll take you to our next death now. Will it be the girl who kills herself at 7:49? No, she dies... some 49 years later, with 3 children and... 7 grandchildren at her side. Next we will see a viral epidemic. Many doctors and nurses... will be tragically killed... over night by an unknown virus. Shall we? Believe me, not all women make empty threats. Some women do go through with it. See? I died... waiting for a man who never came. I shot myself in the head, because I loved him. (DARK TALES OF JAPAN) Would you like to hear a scary tale? What? Would you like to hear a scary tale? Sure, go ahead. Are you SURE you want to hear one? Yeah... I think so. This one starts in the week of the equinox. A young girl and her family... go to visit the family grave. Each year, they go and... wash the headstone, pay their respects and leave flowers and incense. That night, after the girl goes to bed she is roused from her sleep by a presence in the room. She peers into the darkness... and sees the faint outline... of a figure standing in the corner. The figure is vaguely familiar to her. It is someone who loved her dearly... Her grandmother who died when she was still very little. The one whose graveyard they visited just yesterday. But lately, the girl had forgotten all about her grandmother. Memory blurs. Even at the grave, she hardly gave her a second thought. The next night, the figure had moved just a little bit closer. Day by day... closer and closer... closer and closer... Twilight Headstones lnc., where headstones are made with a smile. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! That's all the scary tales for tonight. Sweet dreams. (DARK TALES OF JAPAN)
