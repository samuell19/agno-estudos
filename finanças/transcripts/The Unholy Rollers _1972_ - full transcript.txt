All right. All right. Damn Stern, cheapest guy in the world. Got me doing 15 jobs around here on a guard's pay. Too cheap to give me a helper. "Don't take any tips," he said, "Don't take any tips. "You got to take any tips you got and turn them into the office." I'll tip him in front of a car some night and break his cotton-pickin' head open. Too cheap to even get a decent cloth up here for the announcement booth. Son of a gun, I never saw such a cheap guy in my... I'd ask him for a raise, but I know he'd fire me for asking him. So I'll just keep quiet. I gotta work anyway. I got a wind-up victrola, he won't even let me have a decent electric victrola for the cheapest guy in the world. I never saw such a cheapskate in all my life. [VICTROLA PLAYS VERY SLOWLY] [VICTROLA SPEEDING UP] [VICTROLA PLAYING THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER] [RECORD SKIPS] [CONTINUES SKIPPING] [CONTINUES SKIPPING] -[CROWD CHEERING] -Get on with the fucker! ANNOUNCER: The closing minutes of this most exciting game of our own LA Avengers. They're trailing the Demons by five points. In this sport, anything can happen. Those fans are saying "Go, go, go, Avengers!" And so does their own Angie Striker. She looks concerned, but don't worry, Angie. This team can pull a victory out of a hat. Uh-oh! Lady Rocco and Mickey are breaking out of the pack Lady Rocco goes down hard. Ooh! She's down, down, down like a ton of lead. Fans are after her hide now. They don't like her at all. -[WOMAN SHOUTING] -"I'll kill you! I'll kill you!" says a fan. And Rocco says, "You and who else, Big Mouth? "Just step up here and I'll murder you, and your whole family, too. "You hear that, honey?" Skates off the track in a huff. Our own Doc Morgan's on hand in case there's an injury. -Mickey races up through the back. -Look at that. Look at that. Our own skating star, Mickey Martinez is on a rampage! She's stolen two points. Two big Avenger points! That's only three to go to tie up this game. Horace McKay has come down with his bully bodyguard, Marvin. And Marvin says, "We'll win yet." Ha-ha, Marvin... And watch out, Mickey, watch this one closely. She slams through for two big important points. One to go! Two big Avenger points, the fans are going wild. The fans are saying, "We're going to win!" The fans taste blood, and it's Demon blood they taste, and they love it. They love it. They're hoping to see an Avenger win today. At Stern's big stadium track. [COUGHING] Oh, Rocco says "That's all, Mickey? "You get enough points in one game, I'll take you out." Ooh! Instead she goes... [FANS SHOUTING] [BUZZER SOUNDING] Look at that. Horace McKay is not happy at all. But Horace McKay is never happy. -[BUZZER SOUNDING] -Now Mickey's calling off the jam. -[BLOWS WHISTLE] -What, what is that? Little Primo's holding up six fingers. Now I saw five points, not six. -What do you think that means? -There's your answer, Jack. Horace McKay on the track, to beat up Mickey Martinez. I'm surprised he didn't get his henchman, Masked Marvin, to do it for him. But maybe he felt, she's just a little girl, and he could take care of her himself. He can't stand seeing little Mickey Martinez beating his dirty green Demons. The two most evil men, on this, or any other track. Horace McKay and Masked Marvin, his bully bodyguard. You know, they should call him a bullyguard, don't you think, Jack? You're absolutely right. Look at him, putting his hands up like a champion. -[CROWD BOOING] -He's no champion, he's a loser from way back. Ha-ha. A champion loser is maybe what he means. Now don't forget, skating fans, we have our team tryouts every Thursday afternoon at 3:00 here at Stern Stadium. So, if you can skate and have the true sporting spirit, you may get to be a part of these thrilling roller tournaments yourself... [MACHINERY WHIRRING] Where we you last night? I went to the game. We couldn't go, Felipe's aunt was up from Tijuana. Then Christina was sick. We kept trying to get out, we couldn't make it. Mickey did some really great stuff, she's fantastic! -Knocked Rocco right out on her ass! -[LAUGHS] You should be doing better than that. I got the same exact Ramcharger -and I'm getting at least nine. -What is this, Daytona? You're supposed to be working. Look at these cans! The machine's supposed to be working. We're supposed to be watching. We're watching! Boy, I'd like to get Mickey Martinez down here, turn her loose on a couple of people. -You oughta turn yourself loose. -Get off! Keep your crappy hands off me! I heard you talked to Mr. Tallahassee about a raise Yeah, I talked to him. You don't talk to Mr. Tallahassee about nothing, you talk to me. I got nothing to talk to you about. You talk to me about your raise. I told you keep your hands off me! Listen, Walker, you want that raise, you better change your work habits a little bit. Step up to the office, Walker, we'll talk about that raise. You make me sick! Step into my office, Walker, we'll talk about whether you still work here at all! You're sick! Sick! Sick! Sick! I don't need this crap. There's a lot of jobs I could get. -And I definitely don't need this stupid job! -Oh, yes, you do. Nope! I'm getting out of here! [MACHINERY WHIRRING] What the... What the hell is this? You're crazy! I'm not working for that pervert anymore! I'm gonna kill her! That broad, I'm gonna kill her! What are you, nuts or something? Fucking nuts! -Hey, wait. -KAREN: I'll call you later! -Hey! I quit my job! -[MOANING] -[MOANING] -I quit my job! About time! MAN: What are we gonna do? How we gonna pay the rent? Well, I don't know. Well, she can do something besides work in that cat food factory. I just asked a question. [PANTING] She can find something that she can do that she likes. I mean, three years we've been living together and she's been coming home crazy. -She wants to quit, she can quit. -I was just asking. [PANTING] You got a cigarette? Hmm. We'll talk about it later. After the two of you have finished doing whatever it is you're doing. [PANTING] -[MOANING] -Oh! Ow! Ah! Ow! DONNA: You gotta be like me. I mean, if it weren't for my dancing lessons, -I'd be stuck in some stupid factory, too. -Well, I can't dance like you. And, besides, you're not having such an easy time of it, either. Yeah, but I'm working towards something. I got something to shoot for, you know. All right, I'll go out in the morning and find another job. -Another stupid factory? -No. I'll sign up for dancing school. -I'm sorry, this line's closed. -What do you mean, closed? You were closing up when you saw us coming. It's closed. -What's the trouble? -She closed the line up on us. Well, you'll have to use the other line. What? Our food's got some disease that she can't touch it? I'm on my break! I'll put you on your break! -Stop this! Now stop it! -Well, tell her to check us out! She is on her break. We've got a union here. And once she goes on her break there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry, you'll just have to use the other counter. I'm not using no other line. -Hey wait for me! -Hurry up! [BOTH LAUGHING] STERN: Now, all you people who are here for the tryouts. Those of you that aren't here for the tryouts, please leave the arena. Those of you sitting here, you have to try out. Now, those of you people that can't roller skate, please leave the arena. Now, those of you that can roller skate. Get up on the track and start roller skating! Up! Up! Up! Let's go! Come on, what are you waiting for? The organ music? Marshall, go help some of those people get on the track. If they fall, we're not insured. -Yeah, but... -Go, go, go, go. [UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] STERN: Marshall, where'd you find these people? Will you just tell me that? Where did you find these idiots? MARSHALL: Where we always find them, street corners, unemployment offices, parks, restaurants... STERN: Yeah, that guy right there, huh? Get him off the track, Marshall. MARSHALL: Oh, give him another chance, Stern. There's another good one, right there. STERN: That kid. No, that kid, there. She could be terrific. -What's her name? -Walker, Karen Walker. STERN: Walker, huh? C'mon, c'mon! Get up and skate! Skate! STERN: All right, forget it. Enough of that. Get that bird off. Get him off the track! [INAUDIBLE] STERN: And that's fall three. Get 'em all out of here, would ya? I'm getting crazy from this. They're gonna get killed, Marshall. Thanks to you and your dumb casting. Ooh, we got three left. Marshall, I got news for you. None of 'em can skate. -Marshall, sign up all three of them. -The guy, too? He's perfect! We'll put him on the Demons. They'll hate his guts! You seem to forget, Marshall, showmanship. -That fag'll sell tickets for at least a month. -What about the other guy? If moves down to Omaha, we won't do too bad, two out of three. Ah! Did you see what that broad just did? She knows. That's what I keep telling you about. Showmanship. -I'll repeat it. Showmanship! -I know. Beautiful. [ALL CHEERING] Man, I think it's a fine thing. Anything that lets me get loaded on somebody else's Cold Duck is ok. [LAUGHING] In that case, we'll be drinking Cold Duck for the rest of our lives. She'll be brushing her teeth with it! I don't care if she washes her feet in it, as long as I get some. -[LAUGHS] -[KNOCKING ON DOOR] I must get on! [GIGGLES] Well, you're really gonna be a big star, huh? [LAUGHS DRUNKENLY] -C'mon, let's go watch Donna. -Nah, you go watch Donna. I got some work to do here. [BAND PLAYING UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC] [PATRONS CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] You boys mind if I sit in? Think you're old enough? This is a dangerous game. -That dangerous enough for you? -Hey! Let go of my ear! Let her play, she's got money. -Deal -Cut 'em. Ante 20. The girl is a good-looking girl and she can dance nice. The only thing with it, she don't have any tits. So the boss told her you go to Anaheim, get your tits pumped up. We'll give you more money. She goes to Anaheim, gets silicone in her tits. When she come back, her tits are as hard as a rock. When she dances, her ears move more than her tits. -So we had to fire her. -[WOMAN LAUGHS] MAN 1: This looks like an easy hit, right here. There's a market for Chrysler parts, You open the hood, I'll get the toolbox. [WHISTLING] Flashlight? You sure gotta lot of crap in here. This girl's boyfriend come in the other night and she said to him... She said, "I want $10." He said, "What do you want $10 for?" She said, "I wanna buy myself a brassiere." He said, "Hell, you ain't got nothing to put in it." -She said, "You wear shorts, don't you?" -[WOMAN LAUGHS] All right. Tell me, what's better, two pairs, or three-of-a-kind? In poker, three-of-a-kind beats two pair. Oh! Well, in that case, kings full! Sure is nice playing with you boys! It's very nice. You're cute! You're just like a bunny rabbit! [GIGGLES] I told you, honey, I'm waiting for my brother. Well, pretend I'm your brother. [GIGGLES] You don't look anything like my brother. -Could you leave your brother a note? -Okay. MAN 1: Carburetor. MAN 2: Carburetor. -Give me a 3/16ths, open. -How you gonna find an open end? Unless you got the closed end to find the open one? -How do you spell "executive"? -E-X... Just say you left with a friend. How do you spell "friend"? -I gotta get out of this business. -[WHISTLING] MAN 2: Not me, boy. This is the only excitement I get. [WOMAN LAUGHING] -Excuse me, sir. You happen to have a spare cigarette? -Sure, take one. Oh, thanks a lot. Well, uh, good luck to you. What a fancy car! Must be good dough, an executive! -Slide right in, honey. -Okay. MAN 1: Boy, that was close. MAN 2: What are you worried about? What's he gonna do? Follow us? [IGNITION CLICKING] It's a nice car, but it's too bad it doesn't work. Is there anything I can do? Yeah, give me a push. What's happening? I wanted to ask you something. That shirt look like it's worth $22.50 to you? -Four-and-a-half. -C'mon! Make it at least 10. COACH: Maybe one or two of you new players, will end up playing professional. Let alone making the big bucks. Probably, some of you will end up in the hospital And one thing that might help keep you out of the hospital, is to remember, that what happens on the track and what happens on your home television are as different as morning, noon and night. For example, take the hitting. Now, if you hit in the way you are being taught, the people will be happy. And you will not have to go to the hospital. Now, the kicking, always, and I repeat myself, always, make sure the person you're gonna kick knows you're gonna kick them. Now you'll find out the reason for this, the first time you're on the receiving end of a kick you weren't prepared for. And when you are hit, and when you are kicked, let the people know you are in pain. Now, we have several different types of screams. And you'll have many occasions to use them all, I promise you. Now, you're all aware of the rules, by which the game is played The jammer puts on their helmet and goes one time all the way around the track. And then passes the pack in whatever way he or she is able to do so. And one point is awarded for every opponent that the jammer passes. Now those are the rules as far as the people are concerned. As far as you're concerned, the rules are... To let the people see what they come here to see. They want to see a lot of fighting, so we give them a lot of fighting. And the fighting occurs... Where the people can see it. These positions are known by the terminology Fight Position A... What is he using so much chalk for? Doesn't he know chalk costs money? ...C... And, Fight Position D. Which is the infield, or the central portion of the track -[KNOCK ON DOOR] -Yes? Hi. Uh, Karen Walker. I, uh... They send me for a physical. Would you like me to take my clothes off? Oh, yes. Yes, I would. Yes, well if you'll just sit on the table, now. Oh! Whoo! -Cold? -Yeah. We'll warm it up, there, for you. C'mere. Come. Come. Don't you use instruments or something? Young woman, the human hand is the most efficient instrument ever devised. -Oh. -If you'll turn around now. Hey, are you a real doctor? I pursued my studies at not only one, -but three medical schools, and I... -[KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. Sorry to barge in. -I just wanted some more pills. -Excuse me. You remember what they looked like? They looked like pills. What should they look like? Well, were they red, green, blue? I should remember. [CHUCKLES] Uh... I don't know, they just looked like pills. Here. Try these. -Nice and warm. -Yeah, well... [CLEARS THROAT] That's the first thing they teach us at the doctor school. How to warm up a table. Did you know there are nine different kinds of hospital tables? -No! -And, uh... And nine different ways of warming them up. Hey, am I all right? Oh, yes. Yes, you're fine, as we doctors say. -You're in fine shape. -Good. Then you finish. Yes, I guess I can. -Oh, uh. Do you need any pills or anything? -No. No thanks. Uh, well here's something you'll be wanting. Orthopedic skate inserts. All the skaters use 'em, you know. -Oh! Where can I buy a pair? -Where? Right here! $6.95 a pair, you buy them from me, and they're medically approved. Now, how many pairs can you use? [KNOCK ON DOOR] -What was that? -MAN: God, sounds like an earthquake. [GIGGLES] Staying here today? [PANTING] No, I was just getting used to how it feels. Well, how do I look? -You look terrific, but it's 2:30 in the afternoon. -Ooh, you're kidding. Ooh, I figured it'd be 6:00 by now. Your suit's going to get a little wrinkled sitting around there like that, isn't it? All right, I'll take it off! ANNOUNCER: Well, we're in the top half of the second period here. For big exciting sixth game in a row between the Avengers and the Demons. You know, the Avengers have won the last five. They're up for another victory and Nick Diminez, the captain of the team, number six, is determined to win. Nick Diminez, in the six years he's been with the Avengers, he's skated over 3,150 miles and scored 27,000 points which, of course, means his name is included in the roller roster of golden scores with 10 platinum stars following. Well, you know there's some folks here from the Golden Amber Beer Company. Forty-two salesmen, to be exact. They're sponsoring the game in part. Golden Amber Beer, "The beer that's light, the beer that's right, "the beer that's ecologically correct." In the new deposit bottles. "Golden Amber Beer, everybody's pleasure." Well, looking out on the track I see that Angie's wearing her hot pants... Look at her go! Oh, give them a leg, there, Angie. Our own Angie Striker, everybody loves her. Everybody should. Well, I see there's some new faces on the Avenger bench tonight. Anxious to get into the game, yes, skaters that are unproved... MICKEY: Hi, sweetie. When you gonna come out and play with the big girls? You can see these exciting, thrilling, roller competitions in person by simply calling Capital 2-1-5-3-3 for reservations. Be here and see the players in person, live. Right here at Stern Stadium, Capital 2-1-5-3-3. Hey! When do I get to skate? Soon as one of the regulars breaks a leg. Would you make it quick? Angie Striker, Angie Striker! Horace McKay is standing on the track again. -Will you get him out of there, please! -Stay! ANNOUNCER: Incidentally, Jack, I just received a wonderful telegram from Chad and Trixie of the Summit Truck Stop Cafe and they say, "Go go go Avengers!" Great Avenger fans, Chad and Trixie, and they haven't missed a game on television for three-and-a-half years. Every single game for three-and-a-half years! [GROANS] ANNOUNCER: An illegal block by Amy Rocco! ANNOUNCER: Robert Marshall went crashing into the rail. No! Goddamnit! ANNOUNCER: The brusher was invented by Johnny Bazar many years ago. Little Primo waves off traffic. Doc Morgan comes out to administer aid to the fallen girl. Doc Morgan, by the way, is not only our wonderful house physician but has done important research on the subject of alcohol and its effect on competitive sport. Marshall. Go tell the Voice of America they're sending the new broad in. ANNOUNCER: It definitely looks like Roberta Marshall has to be replaced. I don't know by who because she's the star blocker of the Avengers. Who have we got left, Harry? HARRY: Oh, they're replacing her with number 3. I've never heard of her. Who is she? ANNOUNCER: Well, Karen comes to us from the food-processing industry... Go! Go! Go! ANNOUNCER: Oh, lots of life, these smoking skaters, reaching for that shining star of success, and she's reaching tonight. She does a lap of the track by way of saying hello to the max capacity crowd and they say, "Hello Karen, let's see a few good plays. Go go go Karen Walker of California!" ANNOUNCER: There's Marvin again. Can't we finish one game without that monster on the track? What's he doing out there, Harry? HARRY: It looks like he's handing out masks to the entire losing team. That's what he is doing. He's giving them all masks. Isn't that illegal? [CROWD BOOING] In fact, our own Angie Striker wrote a letter to the commission about these masks. As yet, the commission hasn't reached a decision so my hands are tied. I just don't know, Jack. JACK: Horace should hide his face behind a mask, he's a disgrace to the game. What a bold toreador! [SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY] Off the track, off the track! Come on. One, two, three! He made it just in time, before the three-second recovery rule went into effect. And I'm told that he's gonna get another 25-dollar fine for mouthing off to a referee. HARRY: That man never learns. JACK: Oh, a mean blocking for Karen Walker and down she goes. HARRY: This looks like it might be the beginning of a war, Jack. [INAUDIBLE ANNOUNCER BANTER] HARRY: Very spunky. JACK: There she goes! Look at her! Fallen to the ground and she ripped off her mask! Look at that, she tore the mask right off her face! [CROWD ROARING] HARRY: A victory souvenir. Lady Rock on the big beef goes, "Moo moo moo! Moo moo moo!" Certainly a slap in the face to the mild-tempered Horace McKay. Take off your mask and fall away. [CROWD JEERING] There she is, Karen Parker flaunting that mask! You see? You see what I mean about showmanship? That's why I'm the boss. I know about showmanship. That's why you're just my son-in-law. MR. STERN: You don't know nothing about showmanship. Now, that broad. She knows about showmanship. You're all a bunch of goddamn cheerleaders. You can't block worth a shit. You skate like a bunch of paraplegics. And you fight like you're afraid your goddamn makeup's gonna get smeared. Jesus, I wish you were competition when I was coming up. Why, I'd be a millionaire three times over today. And you, Godzilla. Yeah, muscles made you a big star. Well, use them! Do any of you remember the game plane? That's what tells you what we're gonna do in the game. You goddamn skaters can follow it. Jesus, I don't know. It's like talking to a bunch of goddamn ballerinas. Shit! Hey, that was a good idea, grabbing that mask like that. Thanks. Coming from you, that's a compliment. Only you shouldn't have done it. Why not? Because nobody knew you were gonna do it. So what? So what? Somebody could've missed a block or you could've screwed up a jam or broken your goddamn neck, that's what's so what. You did a real good job for your first night. Now what's that supposed to mean? You just wanna stick a little closer to the game plan is all. And do what you're told, you'll keep your job longer. And get a little more meat on those bones! What the hell is this? [CACKLING] [ALL LAUGHING] This isn't for a skate. It's for a goddamn girl to count! [LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY] [LAUGHING] They're real friendly, aren't they? It's a tough game. If you can't take it... If I can't take what? Ah, don't let it get to you. What are you doing after this? I got some friends waiting. We go to this little bar in Venice. You oughta come, seeing it's Sugar's night and all. You know, surely could help you want to be part of the team. I am part of the team. You got a uniform. You ain't part of the team yet. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] So the guy says, "We always do it on our hands and knees." "You know? Dog fashion?" And the doctor tells him, "That's why you got a back ache all the time!" And the guy says, "But how else could we both watch TV?" [LAUGHING] How's it going so far? Oh, it's all right. I can't say the company's too great. Oh, you gotta live with 'em for a while. You oughta take it easy at first. No one told me to take it easy when they hired me. It ain't gonna make you any friends, babe. I never had trouble making friends. Tell you what. Why don't you go find me a beer? Go on. Meanwhile, I'll try to think of something for us to do later on. Okay? Hey, doll? Gimme a beer. Hey, wanna finish the game? Keep your slimy hands off me! What are you, crazy? I was just playing. Well, go play with somebody else! I wanna play with you. Come on, let's teach her a lesson! [GROANING] [MICKEY LAUGHING] I've heard of ugly dykes in my life. But I never figured one would be so ugly, she'd have to go through all this trouble just to get a chick to strip for her. How about you, bitch? You ever been this close to a decent-looking body before? Take a good look, all of you. Because that's all you're get is a look. But I will remember this, lover. And whenever I want a pair of big, strong arms to help me, I'll go find me a man. And you. You'd like to have me, wouldn't you? I suppose you'd steal some blind man's dog, huh? Look. Get your own. Don't push it, darling. You're not pretty enough to fight for. All right, cool it. Let's go. Let's go, come on, baby. Take it easy. Calm down, come on. Let's get over here, babe. Why did they do this to me? I mean, how am I gonna walk home like this? One thing at a time, huh? Now just sit down. Are you okay, huh? Stay here a minute by yourself. I'm gonna go in there and see if there's anything left of your clothes. Hey... You're gonna come back, aren't you? You out here, I'm gonna stay in there? It's true. Right there, on the motorcycle. She doesn't have anything on. [STAMMERING] Wait, wait, wait... She's looking at... I think I better go, she's... She's... She's coming for me. There might be a whole gang of 'em, you never can tell these days. Yep. Bye. Kinda messed 'em up. Yeah. Hey, come on. Get up. Come on. Come on. There you go. Come on. Thanks for getting my stuff. If it makes you feel any better, you really freaked 'em out in there, you know that? Yeah? Why don't you let me take you home? Your house or mine? Same difference. [LAUGHING] Let's not go home right away. Where do you wanna go? I don't know. Feels good just to ride. Hey, hey, come on now. Put it back [GUNSHOT] Watch it, Karen. Don't do that. Put it back! Not again, Karen. [GUNSHOT] All right, that's it. Knock it off. [GUNSHOT] Hey, did your mom ever tell you about playing with guns, little girl? Nope. She just told me to be careful they didn't go off. You keep playing with that one and it's just liable to go off. Now put it back. Let me drive. I can out-drive you with my eyes closed. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. Jesus, goddamn! [SNORING] [DOOR SLAMS] Nick! You damn near scared the shit out of me, boy. I thought I had that damn door locked. We're just coming by to get a little practice. Mind if we go rolling? Yep. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] [YELPING] [KAREN EXCLAIMING] [GROANING] [LAUGHING] NICK: That's it. [EXCLAIMING] GREG: Why'd she want us to meet her here? DONNA: Don't ask them any questions, huh? I don't understand what they've been doing in there. Practicing all night or what? Listen, when she comes out, you'll know what's been doing, all right? Hey! Donna, Greg, meet Nick. Nick, that one's Donna. That's Greg. Hi. Well, hi, Nick. How you doing? Nick's one of our skaters. -Oh really? -Uh-huh. GREG: Well, get in! [ALL LAUGHING] What's been going on, anyway? -Guess what? -What? I got paid! Cash! Yeah, let's get one of those organic burgers! -All right. -Right on. Oh, come on, Tookie. Come on! [ALL SCREAMING] [POP MUSIC PLAYING] [GIGGLING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Why don't you get one of these tattoos? Oh, yeah, wouldn't I look terrific with a butterfly like that on my arm? Yeah. It would look great. -Go on, Nick. I dare you. -I dare you. All right, I will. I want a tattoo. MAN: Just go around to the door on the side there. You're kidding. Oh Greg, get a tattoo for me, would you? A big heart right here that says, "Donna, I love you." -I can't. -Why? Well, I can't have any scars, moles, tattoos, any identifying marks of any kind. Why? Because of my profession! [BOTH LAUGHING] ANNOUNCER: Here we are again in San Diego, home of Uncle Sam's Pacific League and the dirty Demons. Well, Mickey Martinez is back from her two-week vacation well-rested but seven pounds overweight. Just enough to have Uncle Sam's... [GROANING] Say, girls, do you know that your favorite skating star is probably wearing a Billie Joe Quinn wig, a wig that stays put. Made of miracle Mylar, they are fire-resistant and attractive. The Quinn wig can be found at Ginch Hardware in National City, next to the bus station. What do you think? What do I think? I hate to say this, Marshall, but Mickey's not selling tickets like she used to. Even out of town. On his home turf tonight, Max Marvin says "I'm looking for you, Mickey Martinez." "Come up and get yours." Mickey's cross to the idea. Of course, she's never been down by Marvin, ever. Marvin says, "Come around once more and I'll prove it." [MICKEY EXCLAIMING] There he goes, he puts her against the rail. One, two, blam, blam. Down she goes. HARRY: Down she goes in a blaze of glory. We better think of something to put a little fire in this game. All right, what do you want to do? Look, go down to the Voice of America. Tell him to keep pushing Karen. Karen, Karen! Now you're talking. I'm talking, but you're not listening. Go! JACK: Well, that was a stunning display of cowardice by Marvin. He wouldn't dare do that if he wasn't at his home track. Look at that! Karen Walker says, "I don't care whose track you're on, "you won't do that to an Avenger." One, two, three, wham, bam, thank you, sir. A left and a right and a left and a down and a sideways and a front to back and up! HARRY: Down he goes like a ton of hot air, right onto the track. Max Marvin gets what he deserves and now she's giving the crowd the victory salute. JACK: But what... HARRY: What is that on her arm? I can't... It's a tattoo. It's a tattoo. It's the Avengers insignia. A flying, winged rollerskate. JACK: That certainly is. What a girl. Young Karen Walker, there's a girl who's certainly on fire tonight. HARRY: Well, Mickey Martinez is taking a break against the rails saying, "Whoo, I'm a little weathered after that beating, I'm a little tired, I'm a little rusty tonight. Karen, you take the helmet, you take the jam, I'm going to take it easy." JACK: Ah, but I don't think there's gonna be much rest for Mickey Martinez tonight. Rocco says, "Move in a little closer, Mickey, I've been waiting for you." Wham-o! [GROANING] JACK: Down she goes. First Harmon and now Rocco, I've never seen Mickey take a beating like this before. HARRY: Look at this. Horace McKay is over there giving her a few kicks. That's probably the only way that man ever gets his kicks. You know, I heard he was refused a job in the circus when it was found out how chicken he was. JACK: Well, Margaret says, "We'll win tonight." When Karen says, "Nothing doing..." HARRY: Wham! Two big points. Look at that tattoo, it's really what tonight is. That scoreboard is spinning like a roulette wheel. See, Marshall? I keep drilling it in your head. Competition is good for business. Yeah, like showmanship? HARRY: Well, Karen Walker certainly saved the game after Mickey Martinez went down tonight. She's sailing through these Demons like a woman possessed and picking up points all the way. She's point-crazy and look at that! Boom! Amy Rocco bruises the basement with her tremendous weight and she seeks refuge under the table! HARRY: Like a turtle crawling into a shell. JACK: Get in there, Rocco. The entire team appears to be after her tonight. Angie's going at her with a whip, laying it on her hot and heavy. I'll tell you, this is a sensational game. [SQUABBLING AND SCREAMING] JACK: Visit the King Kong Kat Korner, everything for your pussy in La Mesa. HARRY: Well, with Karen Walker a new blood in this game tonight, it certainly has turned into a free-for-all. [CROWD BOOING] Karen Walker is just what the Avengers needed to breeze off sacking Mickey Martinez. A sensational performance by Miss Karen Walker, the newest addition to the Avenger team. Hello, Karen Walker. Hello Karen Walker, from all of us. [BLUES MUSIC PLAYING] You know it looks like, to me, I'm in the same place as you are. Whatever you say, Joe. And, just then, in walks the farmer's daughter. And the salesman looks at the farmer, and the farmer says to the salesman, "Yep. Did it the hard way." "Standing up in a canoe." [LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY] Can I have a Cloret? Keep 'em. Now she thinks it's her breath. Before that, it was her goddamn armpits! She's always got some reason nobody'll ball her. And the real reason is she's the lousiest ball on this bus. That's fantastic. Thanks. The crowd really loves it. They eat it up. Look. We got no reason to be worried. How long have we been on top? Four years? Something like that. And how long's Stern been keeping somebody behind us? Four years. And he'll be keeping a second skater pushing us another four. I wouldn't know about that. The only thing that's sure is it ain't gonna be Karen Walker. We'll still be on top. When she's just some old bitch on the street with a friggin' tattoo on her arm. Oh, come on, Mickey. You know this racket better than that. So the guy looks down at the both of 'em and he says, "I'm surprised at you. You mean you've never done anything like this before?" And the dog says, "Sure. I never had the money." [ALL LAUGHING] NICK: Hey, Karen? I want you to meet my wife, Tina. Tina, this is Karen. Karen, this is Tina. Hi. Fine. How are you? Got yourself a hell of a husband. [SCOFFING] -She knows that, don't you? -Uh-huh. Want a stick of gum? Thanks. Hey, come on. Let's go baby. Come on. Nice to meet ya. See ya. I didn't know Nick was married. What do you care? What he needs is some upward mobility. Honey, that's one thing he's got plenty of. So where do you want it? Right here is good. Right here? If you put it in the middle of the room, someone's gonna break their neck. How else are you gonna be able to watch TV? Yeah, we gotta be able to see the TV. You can't stick it in the middle of the room! Hey, look! Whose house is this? Hey, quiet. Quiet. What's on TV? It's on! Hi. We're the skating stars from the LA Avengers. And when we get through with a rough night on the track, you can bet we ache all over. We didn't know what to do about it until we heard about the amazing Rocket Chair. [SIGHS] Oh! This wonderful little invention takes away all those aches and pains in a soothing, satisfying five minutes. When I get home from a hard day at work, you can bet I head straight for my Rocket Chair. Why, there's nothing a Rocket Chair can't do for a girl's tired body. Or a man. Or a child. [LAUGHING] The Rocket Chair will vibrate your back, your legs, your arms, massage your neck and feet, and send stimulating yet harmless electric shocks through your body. It'll give you that pep and energy. It'll even help you take inches off that tummy. KAREN ON TV: I'm so glad I have a Rocket Chair. That was great. You like a movie star or something? Yeah, it was really great seeing you on TV. You wanna sign here? Thanks. Great watching you move the furniture. [LAUGHING] See ya. See you guys later. You really liked it, huh? Yeah, really. GREG: Karen, you were fantastic. I'd go out and buy one of those things if I had any money. We'll get one soon enough, too. As soon as we open our shop. What shop? Greg and me are going into business. Together? Sure. We're gonna combine our talents and make a fortune. We're gonna open a topless bike repair shop! [LAUGHS] A topless bike repair shop? You're kidding. In Oregon. They've never seen anything like that there. Or down here either, I'd guess. Yeah, we're gonna do that as soon as we get our money together. Gotta have enough so I can keep on taking dancing lessons. Well, do you want some money? -Oh. -No, we're gonna do it on our own. Hey, you're not leaving just because I'm making lots of money now, are you? -No. -No. We've been talking about it for a long time. Well, you can stay. I mean, you don't have to go. I want you to stay. We have to go. Really, we do. Yeah. We do. We have to go. We've got all the time you want. So glad you could come down with me. I just couldn't face doing this whole thing alone. I mean, look at this car. I mean, it's really horrible. Say, can I be of some help to you ladies? Yeah. I wanna buy a car. Well, this here's a beauty, here. A '68. Got 180 thousand miles on it and got 180 thousand miles more left in it. But I'll tell you what, it's a great buy for $795. Belonged to an old friend of mine. She took good care of it. But you know, it looks like you could really use a car. I'm gonna let you have this car for $100 less, $695. I don't want your friend's crappy old car. I beg your pardon. I want a new car. And with a lot of chrome. Well, I could show you something newer, but, uh, of course, we're going to have to run a credit check. I got credit all over this town. -Can I ask you your occupation? -Sure. Look at this. That's me. I know you. You're the boom boom girl, from television. -Yeah. -"Boom boom!" -I remember you. -That's me. Say, I'll tell you... By the way, what's your name? Consuelo Cardeniz. Oh, yes. I'll tell you what, you come with me inside to the showroom. I'm gonna show you our cars that are just gorgeous. -Come on. -Come on. Come on. Yeah. I got some beauties in here. Take a look. It's got the most beautiful leather seats you've ever seen. Go ahead, try it. Sit down. Feel how they hug you. They're right close to your body. The most beautiful thing you have ever seen is in this car. It has a special carburator. Dual carburators to be exact. It has an air conditioning system. It has a special lock on this thing, locks the doors, locks the trunk, raises your antenna, and I'm gonna tell you, if you drove this car into a brick wall, you wouldn't know what hit you. Will you come out, I wanna show you a few other things this car comes equipped with. It's got chrome hubcaps. It's got a tinted windshield. It's got a vinyl top that's strong enough for you to go roller skating on. Sounds good, but it needs rugs. -Throw rugs. -Rugs, throw rugs. -Lots more chrome. -We can put our super chrome package -on each side of this car. -Well, what is that? -Well, you see... -Take it. And a horse right here. And paint it blue with a white top. Blue with a white top and a horse on the hood. How soon can she have it? Oh, it'll take weeks. Weeks. But, uh... But, uh... I can get it for you real soon, ma'am. What'd you have to tell Tina? I didn't have to tell Tina nothing. Saturday is my day to shoot. That's a fact of life. But does she know what you're shooting? Ha ha, that's real funny. [BOTH CHUCKLING] Hey, look. You came to watch me shoot? Well, shut up and watch me shoot. Now, watch this. Crappy shot. Oh, what the hell do you... Watch. Not bad. Let me try. Shut up. Come on, big shot. At least give me a try. Okay, try. Thanks. -I did it! -Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck twice? It's empty. You gotta load it. Here, move out of the way. Now look, we got some safety and sanity rules when you fire a gun at a range, you understand? Now, you squeeze off your shot. You're not flippin' them off like some little fairy. You stand on the firing line and you point your gun down range. All right, here. Try it again. Hey, not at my head. Down range. All right? -[GLASS BREAKING] -Don't shoot the place apart like that. Stop it. Don't do stuff like that. How about that? How about that? Who's gonna pay for all that? How would you like to be my next target? Why don't you stand down there for me. All right, give me the gun, Karen. Come on, you know I'm not a very good shot. You just saw the evidence. Yeah, bullshit you're not a good shot. Give me the gun. Stand right there and don't move. That's right. I don't even want to see you breathing hard. Kiss me. ANNOUNCER 1: Coming out of the south turn, Karen Walker grits her teeth and says, "I need one more big Avenger point to put me over the top." ANNOUNCER 2: Over the top on Mickey Martinez's all-time scoring record average of 38/62... That's enough to put her in the Roller Silver Skate Hall of Fame if she gets it. It's impressive but she may do it tonight. She's within two points of breaking Mickey's record. Three points of breaking it. Mickey Martinez can't be any too happy with that. That Karen is terrific. Yeah, she's all right, but she needs a little controlling. ANNOUNCER 1: Karen Walker has certainly earned the right... In the crowd here tonight, there's two of our oldest friends, Jack, Mrs. Flynn and Princess Sha Ra Ga. They haven't missed one game of the 1742 consecutive games... -Get her! Get her! Get her! - ...played by the Avengers, right here at Stern Stadium. Good fans, true fans, loyal fans, saying, "Go, go, go, Avengers." Karen Walker goes for the old slingshot. Whammo, right through the fork and it looks like she's very close to picking up that all-important point. ANNOUNCER 2: This may be it, Jack, she's sailing around now. She's ready to do it. She's going right and... Masked Marvin. They're way out. Look at that. Masked Marvin... What the fuck do you think you're doing? Sorry. Accident. ANNOUNCER 2: ...a few words among themselves. What's your problem? Ah, they think they're gonna make that new kid a star overnight. They're gonna have to deal with me first. Stern can do anything he wants to. Now you got ten seconds to get back in there. To hell with them. You better get going, or you're gonna pick up your unemployment in a wheelchair. Excitement reaches a feverish pitch as Karen skates over to say hello to the Karen Walker fan club from her home town. Look at that. Mickey just grabbed the helmet away from Karen and said "I think I'll make a few points of my own." Karen goes right into Rap Reynolds. Oh. Bad rap, Rap Reynolds. And there she goes. Karen Walker, there's nothing that can stop her tonight. She's after Mickey again, she says, "Mickey, I want you to step over here "and talk to you about a few things, here. Co-captain, "but you're not running the whole show." Mickey calls for help. Mickey calls for help and a dirty Demon has to come and help Mickey attack Karen. I've never seen anything like this in 14 years on the track. Mickey Martinez called Roacho to help her beat up her own team mate, Karen Walker. Stinking is what I call it. ANNOUNCER 2: Well, it's unbelievable. I think this is a good time to read a telegram just handed to me from the commission. It's marked Top Secret, but I think these fans should know about it anyway. Listen to this. Listen to this, Rickey Martinez, who was the skating star of the Avengers, up until now, has been traded down, down, down to the San Diego Demons. ANNOUNCER 1: And there's no kidding about it, she acts like one. ANNOUNCER 2: Oh, no more will Mickey Martinez skate in the orange and black of the Avengers. From now on she'll be in the dingy green of the San Diego Demons. Well, that certainly puts Karen Walker at the top of the heap. She's queen of all she surveys now. She broke Mickey's record... Okay, so now the queen of the lunatics is #1. Who've we got for #2? How about Little Debbie? She's really been working hard. No, no. What's the name of that black broad from Fresno? -Beverly Brayton? -Yeah, look, you'll call Seymour in Fresno. Tell him to put her on the bus tomorrow. Yeah, but is she good enough? Good enough, bad enough, who cares? The suckers will love her. Marshall, remember what I told you. Yeah, I know. Showmanship. You'll call Seymour first thing. Yes, Pop. Some son-in-law. What's your name? -Frank. -Frank? Thanks for the marshmallows. Take care. You ready? Why don't you wait outside? What are you some kind of queen? You gotta get dressed in private or something? Come on. Yeah, I am some kind of queen. Off with your head. [GIGGLING] Why don't you act like a normal person? Huh? 'Cause I'm not a normal person. Oh, yeah? I'm a star! And that means you should appreciate me more. You know, it's not everyone who gets to go out with a star. Jesus, you know if I had any more sense, I'd go back with Tina right now. I mean, she's twice the person you are, you know that? And I'm ten times the woman that she is. [GIGGLING] Yeah, some star. Hey, man, look. If you don't dig it, you can just split. [BOTH YELLING] Now you take those skates off, honey, and you're nothing. You're not even real. Yeah? Well, when you take those pants off, you're nothing. Well, you didn't say that before, honey. You didn't say that before. Well, let's just say it was week for hire the handicapped and I obliged you, Nick. Take it to Tina. Maybe then she won't have to go around with all the other guys on the team. You goddamn bitch, if it wasn't for you... [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] Yes, they'll talk. You gonna ask what they tell her? Why don't you tell me? Maybe they tell her what it's like to be with a real man. Bitch! Phew. Man, you even fight like a girl. Don't toy with me. Don't try me! [GROANS] [GROANING] God damn... You won't be happy until you have your own set of balls! Honey, I got balls. Yours. God damn... Oh, shit! Hi, I'm Karen Walker, skating star of the L.A. Avengers, and I'm skating today for the amazing Zap Pens. You just saw the kind of punishment I put this Zap Pen through while I was skating down the street. Now I'm going to show you that the Zap Pen can withstand any kind of pressure, even the torture I put my skates through. Z... A... P. Zap! See? That's how fantastic the Zap Pen is! Why, it's so great, it's the official pen of the Skating Scorers. And you can bet, when I sign an autograph, it's with a Zap Pen. Oh, by the way, that's Z-A-P. Zap. KAREN: You don't have to go, you know? Look, I'll even pay for half your dancing lessons. We gotta do it! You can come up and see us sometime, you know, when you get some time off. I'm sure you know, there's plenty of room to stay. -Sure. -Well... Take care of yourself, Donna. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. The traffic's starting to build up, so I guess we better head off. You need some money? [CHUCKLES] Well, we could use a couple of bucks to get started. -Bye. -Bye, Karen. DONNA: Come and see us! [VEHICLE STARTING] Marshall, go check cashier number two. I checked there already. Go check it again, huh? Oh. Lunchtime. -Hello, Mr. Stern. -Hello, Beverly. Tell me, did you have a nice trip? Oh, yeah. It was all right. Mr. Stern, I really want to thank you for letting me be an Avenger. Ah, look. By me, a promise is a promise. I like you. And if I like a girl she could do okay. Well, I like you, too, Mr. Stern. You're gonna start out. You're gonna be our number two girl. But keep this in mind, every number one girl started out number two. And in a couple of months, I'm gonna send a team to Europe on an exhibition tour. And I still haven't made up who's gonna be my star. Well, I'll keep that in mind. Please do. The lockers are right over there. You'll find your name on one. Thank you. See you out on the track, darling. JACK: Now, Harry, three weeks ago tonight, Dickie Martinez was traded down to the Demons for beating up her own teammate, Karen Walker, and here she is tonight for the first time in Demon green. Everyone's looking forward to the coming conflict with great interest. The fans are on the edges of their seats. The excitement is almost too great. Hey, you wanna do something later on? No, thanks. Let's go for a delightful ride or something, all right? How boring. Hey, come on. What's the matter? Peter's not enough for you anymore? HARRY: Yes, Jack, a rivalry between these two girls is something to behold. Once the greatest of friends, they're now the bitterest enemies. Mickey in her green Demon suit, and Karen still skating in the orange and black of her own Avengers. There's a new girl in effect. JACK: Ooh, and there is our newcomer, Beverly Brayton, who just dropped her first Demon in her very first game. Sensational, Beverly. Sensational. [BUZZER SOUNDS] HARRY: That was commissioned by skater Beverly Brayton. This is the first time she's skating in the honorable colors of the Avengers, but she's doing a bang-up job, and I mean that in every way possible, Jack. JACK: Indeed, Harry, the crowd is really beginning to warm up to Beverly, and Karen looks none too happy about it to me. HARRY: That's true. The Karen Walker smile has not been in evidence tonight, because some of that thunder is going to Beverly. And I'm sure that seeing her old friend Mickey in the green of Demons isn't making her any too happy, either. JACK: Exactly. Well, here comes Mickey, out from the infield to settle and old score. Ooh, she knocks Karen down, armed with a vicious windmill chop. She certainly learned those dirty Demon tricks in a hurry, doesn't she? HARRY: Only three weeks and she knows all the dirty tricks. Horace McKay has been coaching her personally. That sucker needs some killing. It's an exciting game tonight. The fans are really almost unable to control themselves because of that tremendous air of tension between the two rival girls. JACK: Ooh, and it's a triple slam. Mickey knocks down Karen, and Beverly drops Mickey. Look at that Beverly go! A real Avenger. HARRY: Karen and Mickey are at each other's throats like two mad dogs. The hate and violence has reached a peak and the fans say, "No, no, we want blood." So whose blood do they want? Kick her ass! Kick her ass! Now, it's been building for weeks. We couldn't have expected anything less. Look at 'em go. Jack, it's a fight to the finish between two girls lost in a frenzy of hate. The referees are powerless in the face of this white-hot violence. How can this slaughter be stopped? JACK: Harry, I've just been handed a telegram with the decision from the commission. Maybe we have our answer in that. I'd rather you read it. HARRY: Listen to this. A match race tonight between Karen and Mickey, to see who is the queen of this arena. -[BUZZER SOUNDS] - Well, we'll all know in a few minutes. JACK: Well, Harry, here it is. The big moment that hundreds, thousands of fans have been waiting for. The match race, the grudge race between Karen and Mickey. And there they go! Look at that. They got almost six feet before they started beating each other up. HARRY: Yes, most of the folks came out today to see the hate of a good friendship gone wrong. Mickey in the green of the Demons, and Karen in the orange and black of the Avengers. These girls once liked each other so much, it's a sad thing to see them hating each other this way, now. But it's a spectacular show, one that will be repeated for many a moon, I tell you. It's difficult to describe exactly what's happening from up here, because one minute Karen's up, one minute Karen's down. Give it to her! Give it to her! At a girl! Mickey's up one minute, Mickey's down. Fists flying. Skates flashing. Kicking, scratching, knocking. A brawling, feuding fisticuff... [YELLING] You know, in a private interview before the game, Mickey confided to me that Karen wouldn't make it through this evening, and here it looks that way. [CROWD YELLING] JACK: It's very close to the edge, now. The battle royal continues. Karen Walker knocks Mickey through the railing, and Mickey lands on a sharp edge of a bleacher. [EXCLAIMS] HARRY: It was a short match race, Jack, but a violent one. JACK: The crowd is attacking her and is on top of her, and it really looks bad and poorly after that bad fall. The crowd clears back a little bit. Mickey is lying still, unable to move, apparently. They're calling for Dr. Morgan, and of course we've got to wait for his professional opinion, but it looks to me like it could be serious. [CROWD CHEERING] HARRY: I'm afraid Mickey's unconscious. Poor Mickey Martinez on her first night as a Demon. JACK: Meanwhile, Karen Walker skates off the track giving her triumphant tattoo salute. Referee looks worried. [BLOWS WHISTLE] This beautiful, expensive trophy is just our way of telling you how much we appreciate your efforts. What's the deal? I get a trophy every time I put someone in the hospital? We had this one made special. There's one thing we'd like you to keep in mind. The people are happy, we're happy. We're happy, we keep you happy, okay? Congratulations. Thanks. Now, maybe you'll go outside and autograph a couple of programs? Sure. Oh, and Karen, Maybe you could pay a little more attention to the game plan, huh? -Marshall. -Hmm? How many more of those cockamamie statues we got left? Just two. Call Ernie, tell him to send out another couple of dozen. Oh, tell him to put two on the plane tomorrow. I want them to be in Detroit when I get there. Right. Oh, Marshall, have the sprouts in my office tomorrow. Lunchtime? Lunchtime. What time is it? Superstar. Get your goddamn foot off my car. Ain't that sweet? Stern gave her a clock. -Knock off. -Everybody's got one. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHING] We just wanted to show you how much we appreciate what you'd done for Mickey. That's all, Karen. [EXCLAIMS] [GROANS] [GROANING CONTINUES] [LAUGHS] [GASPS] Wee! [LAUGHS] [SINGS CHILDISHLY] Bye-bye, Karen. Come back tomorrow if you want a little more.

You sure scratched it up quick. Ma, I just came here to give you some money. What do I need with money? I got my cigarettes. I got my TV. What more do I need? Well, maybe you'd like to buy something new, like a new dress, maybe. [LAUGHS] I've been living in this one for so long I wouldn't know how to button up a new one. How'd you get your face all messed up? On the track. It's a rough game. I figured you'd find a rough game. [TIRES SQUEAL] Karen? Karen! Hey, you don't remember me? Dwayne. Duane Bealer. Duane! -How are you? -I'm fine. Yeah, I'd seen you on TV. Well, how'd you like me? -You're great. -Well, what are you doing now? Selling auto parts. Tell me everything. Where are you living? Right down the road. About a half a mile. Hey, I got married. You're kidding. To who? To Elise. Remember Elise? Elise... Yeah. Yeah, I've been married, two, three years, now. That's fantastic. Hey! Play much anymore? No, I... Uh, hey, you kids wanna come inside the house and have a drink, or something? No, I gotta get headed home, ma. Gotta practice, you know? Karen. Why don't you stay, and I can call up Elise and maybe she can come over... Another time later, okay? But tell her I said hi. Goodbye, mom. Goodbye, Duane. KAREN'S MOTHER: Cranky. Always was. [ENGINE STARTS] [CROWD CHEERING DISTANTLY] Thanks. Goldie! What are you doing here? After all the money I spent on your education, I find you in these lousy locker rooms. And with... With this. Go find Marshall and count the house, will ya? [STERN SIGHS] And you? You, Miss America, what are you waiting for? The second half? What do you want me to do? To apologize for being late? Okay. I'm sorry. But do you think that the next time you come barging in here you could knock first? When you pay the rent, you don't have to knock. Yeah, well, you don't pay the rent on me. And the next time you'd like to see me in my panties, why don't you call first before you barge in? 'Cause I wouldn't waste the dime, that's why. You wouldn't know how to spend it. I know that all I am to you is someone to put up on those stupid posters of yours. But I want you to know something. My only goal in life is not to get up and sell tickets for you. You stop selling tickets, you're dead. And what are you gonna do about all those empty seats up there? For your information, young lady, those seats have been filled for 35 years. Yeah, because they come to see the likes of me. Not your little Beverly or any of the other broads. They come to see a star! They come to see who they come to see. And here. Cover yourself up. You're gonna catch cold. Look, Miss Terrific, you go up there and start skating. And get this through your head. You're not skating to please you. You're not skating to please them up there. You're skating to please me! Just who the hell do you think you are? I'm the guy that signs your checks. You get up there and do what you're told for a change. Now what are you gonna do? Fire your only star? You're damn right. And I'm gonna keep my eye on you. Maybe if I lifted my shirt you could see better. I'm gonna keep my eye on you so close you're gonna feel my eyelashes on that shirt of yours. All right, well then you just watch. You just come out here and you watch, because I'm gonna show you something you've never seen before. [DOOR SLAMMING] God, who talked me into her? HARRY: The Avengers' Karen Walker entering the game late, trying desperately to catch up with the huge number of points already racked up by her talented and fast teammate, Beverly Brayton. Karen Walker skating like a woman possessed. JACK: She looks a little tense if you ask me, Harry, the first time Karen Walker looks nervous. HARRY: Yes, she does look a little nervous, but it may be pre-game tension. Pass the star and stay out of my way. What's the matter? Can't you take the competition? I thought you only did what Stern told you to do. JACK: Here's the view from our new eye-in-the-sky camera, showing you the south turn of the bank track in its entirety, a track that has seen many skating stars come and go on the silver wheels of bay. Incidentally, the lens of our new camera is biochemically treat to repel bugs on contact, just the way Karen's repels rocked with that blow. 58 to 55, Karen picks up a point, and Horace McKay says, "You'll pay for that." What a hothead. What does it look like to you, Harry? HARRY: Well, from here it looks like everyone is in a mad scramble for points, Jack. You know that all-important President's Cup is coming up next month and they're all in a race for points to qualify. You know, Jack, everyone here is upset and quite a bit tensed up from that courageous letter from poor Mickey Martinez, still in the hospital, not recovering as fast as she should, but she wrote to her teammate, Beverly Brayton, saying, "Beverly, look out for my interests. "Look out for my old number four. "Keep it polished and bright because I'm coming back." She said this, Jack. "I'm coming back as an Avenger." JACK: Incredible. Look at this. Sal is giving Angie a $25 fine for touching. HARRY: Amazing. Sal is usually such an even-tempered fellow to do a thing like that. But tempers are running high tonight. The tension is just terrific. I see number four... JACK: Look at that. Karen catches a snow plow from a Demon. She's out of control, heading toward the Avenger bench. HARRY: Look at that. She just knocked the entire bench over, and all her teammates. Stupid bitch. JACK: Jennifer attacks her own teammate, lying down helpless. She must feel that Karen hit the bench deliberately and wants to pay her back. Karen skates out onto the track, and here comes Beverly Brayton to give her own teammate a shot. And down she goes. HARRY: Her own teammate, Jack. JACK: Angie struggles in vain to keep these two girls apart, like two mad dogs off the leash. Now Beverly skates back to help her fallen rival. But she doesn't. What the hell was that for? I heard you was taking Mickey's place on the Demons. You haven't got my job yet. Bitch. HARRY: You know, Jack, in an exclusive interview tonight before the show, Beverly Brayton told me that she's after Karen Walker's crown as skating star of the L.A. Avengers. She wants to wear it on that beautiful head of hers and take it away from Karen Walker and there's a good chance she will because Beverly's got talent and nerve. JACK: Jennifer has an evil look in her eyes. She's looking for Karen. I don't think this is over yet. She's peeved at what Karen did to her teammate. Oh! She delivers a big hit. Hey, Karen, do you want to come out? No. Forget it. Karen's up and at it again in spite of her own Avengers' hostility. Fourteen years in this business, she's the looniest goddamn broad I ever saw. Fans are yelling for more with tears of anger in their eyes. They can't get enough! Horace is up to his usual antics. He's the only man I know who enjoys the suffering of others. There's Cannonball Fisher, sidelined on the bench with a severe case of roller whiplash. The jam continues, hot and heavy. Demons here, Demons there, Demons everywhere. And it looks like the Demons are trying everything. The drive Karen right into the Demons' penalty box. Bingo, down she goes! Horace says, "I don't feel like sitting down any more, Marvin, "Take my chair. Be my guest." And pound away he does, right on the penalty box. Karen Walker is under there. She must be near hysterics. HARRY: How can that girl take it from that brute? That man is the worst thing on this track. She's too skinny. Can't take the pounding. Get her! JACK: Well, there's no rest for her, tonight, Harry. We thought help was on the way. Where are the Avengers? Why aren't they helping Karen, their own teammate? HARRY: Jack, I've seen night when the Avengers jumped on the chance to pound a Demon, but tonight they're staying away in droves, as if they wanted to. JACK: And the beat goes on! They're beating a tattoo on Karen Walker's head! Hey, you okay? Yeah, thanks. HARRY: Good for you, Nick Deminas. Nick helps his teammate when nobody else would, lovely Karen Walker. JACK: It looks like there's no rest for Karen Walker tonight. HARRY: Right. Jack. There's no safe harbor for her in this storm. Beverly comes up to take the jam, she says, "I'll go out and get us some points, Karen." Karen... What was that? What was that? HARRY: Did you see what I just saw? How can you fire a girl who can skate like that? If we keep her on, the insurance payments will break us, that's why. Well, keep her for the Demons. Jesus Christ, Stern, look at her skate! She's terrific. That girl just ended her career better than anybody I ever saw. HARRY: Jack, this is incredible. Karen Walker just threw down the jammers helmet, which means she can't legally score any points, whatsoever, and took off on her own. JACK: After delivering a crippling blow to Beverly. HARRY: She knocked down Beverly and evidently hurt her. Doc's trying to get her off, but what is Karen up to? No one's able to understand this. Look at that. She just took out Masked Marvin with one blow, knocked him right over the penalty box, knocked over the entire bench with the Demons on it. I don't know what that girl's up to, but she is mad, M-A-D with capital letters, and those fans don't know what to make of it. -[KAREN LAUGHING] -Slowed this entire game... JACK: Doc Morgan? She's after the doctor, now? She's turning over his bench! HARRY: Well, maybe she needs glasses and doesn't know... JACK: No, now she's after Angie. I've never seen anything like this. Karen's out of control! HARRY: Well, you know, Jack, things really look out of hand here, now. It's gonna take at least 10 or 15 minutes just to get order restored. Everyone seems to be caught up in the frenzy of the evening, hitting and knock and biting. They're down. They're out. It's an exciting game, I'll tell you that. [CROWD CHEERING] JACK: Meanwhile, Karen Walker says, "Thank you but no thank you." Off she goes. Skates right off the track, heading out the door. She can't play by the rules. She can't take orders. Marshall, who needs that kind of aggravation? But how could you let her go? JACK: Yes, Harry, Karen Walker must be off the track herself to do a thing like that. It's a violation of every rule known in the game. [TIRES SQUEALING] ...the first time this has ever happened, and I wager it's the last time it's gonna happen with that girl. [CROWD YELLING] A serious mistake. She shouldn't have done it but she did it. HARRY: Jack, this is incredible. In my 14 years commenting on these games, I've never seen a crowd dissolve in a furious, throbbing fuselage of fisticuffs like what's happening tonight in this arena. They're all hot and heavy, beating, hammering, thrashing, twisting, knocking down anything and everything that moves. JACK: It's incredible. The entire crowd has dissolved to beating and slamming. This is tremendous. I've never seen anything like it before. The game's dissolving in mayhem! HARRY: Well, our own Angie Striker and Horace McKay are fighting it out, out there. Two falls out of three and it's hard to say who'll win, but if Angie falls on Horace... It's an exciting evening. Look at them go! Look at them go! That whip is taking its toll on Horace McKay, and are those fans happy! JACK: Look at that across there! Look what's happening in the bleachers! That lady with the red purse is beating that man in the head... This entire crowd wants blood. The entire crowd is raging in mayhem, screaming, knocking, clawing... [KAREN YELLING AND LAUGHING] We're gonna have a lot of injuries here tonight! HARRY: Squad cars have pulled up to the rear doors and are trying to restore order! [LAUGHING] You know, Jack, this is the first time I've ever seen the audience participate in a game, and the game participate on the audience. [HONKING] You're just gonna let her go out on the street and skate until she gets killed, huh? Believe me, she hasn't got sense enough to get killed. JACK: Karen Walker, but skating off the track in the middle of the game... [ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [KAREN EXCLAIMS] She is down, down, down and out. Off the track, off the team, out of the game. Automatically, Beverly Brayton becomes the number one girl. There can be no appeals to the commission on either one of these rulings. -It's automatic. -[POLICE SIREN APPROACHING] HARRY: That's right, Jack, this is the most exciting game I've seen in a long time, and it opens up a new era in roller competition.
