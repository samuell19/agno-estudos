(dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Narrator] To the worm in the cheese, the cheese is the universe. To the maggot in the cadaver, the cadaver is infinity. And to you, what is your world? How do you know what is beyond the beyond? Most of us don't even know what is behind the beyond. According to Michelangelo, the most beautiful form in nature is the human body. This shop on Chicago's East Side caters to those who would make nature's most beautiful form more beautiful. Our camera is now positioned behind a two-way mirror in the dressing room of this shop. The women you will see have no idea they are being photographed. The mirror does not have the usual black backing and from our side, which remains in darkness, the mirror functions as a window, while to those in the dressing room it appears to be a simple mirror. (ominous orchestral music) (soft rhythmic orchestral music) So as not to offend these ladies or their lovers or husbands, and to satisfy the desires of our own legal department, we were forced to censor their faces. (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) (soft orchestral music) ''I can give you everything I got'' ''I can't expect to give what I have not'' ''I can only give you lovin' 'til the sun goes down'' ''And until the leaves of summer turn to shades of brown'' ''l try and l try'' ''Ooh baby, you know that I can only give ya everything'' (upbeat jazz music) (soft traditional Asian music) (upbeat jazz music) (soft orchestral music) (soft rock music) (suspenseful orchestral music) According to William Shakespeare, the most divine aspiration of the human body is love, but in this bizarre world of ours love takes many forms, some of them very, well, bizarre. This is Nassau, capital of the Bahamas, a small clutter of islands, 3,000 in number, belonging in the British Commonwealth. The principal industries of Nassau are providing tax free havens for United States corporations who wish to avoid paying their share of the cost of government, and providing vacationing Americans a way of spending their money quickly, easily, and comfortably. There is also a small basket weaving industry, but we are not here to talk of industry. These people are the descendants of slaves. Today they are civilized members of the community, educated and responsible, but for some there is still a yearning for the freedom of spirit and abandon of the past. Our quest has brought us to Nassau because this is one of the last places in the Western Hemisphere where the ancient black arts of voodoo are still practiced. Our cameras were hidden in the hills of New Providence, only three and one-half miles from Nassau. These people gather religiously every Thursday to indulge in a most frantic and depraved form of worship. (tribal drum music) What you are seeing here is fortunately a highly revised version of the original terrifying ritual. In the good old days for example, a white baby would be kidnapped for sacrifice. At the peak of the ceremony, the child's body would be dismembered by clever manipulations of the machete, and arms and legs would be thrown into the air in the hope that the lord god Damballa would be pleased and smile upon them. But we'll see none of that here tonight, for after all, these people are civilized. The ceremony begins with the lighting of the sacred fire, a symbol of Damballa's passion. An important part of the sacrament is rum and ganja, the latter being none other than simple marijuana. Voodoo came to these islands over 200 years ago. The raids on the African slave coast began about 1742 and thousands of these believers were sold into the West Indies and, later, further northwest to the Bahamas. Rum and ganja hasten the elevation of the mood to spiritual heights. At the proper moment when the participants are in the required spiritual mood, the voodoo king opens the ceremony. The queen, or mama as she is sometimes called, officiates at the ceremony. (worshipers whooping) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic tribal drum music) The ceremony gets underway with the beheading of a chicken. The white feathered bird serves as a macabre substitute for the white baby. The blood is drained into a wooden bowl. The shot you are now watching was taken with a 1,000 millimeter telescopic lens at a distance of almost one mile. (dramatic tribal drum music) (worshipers whooping) The great serpent of evil, the zombie, or in this case a small boa constrictor, is next to be sacrificed. (dramatic tribal drum music) (worshipers whooping) Its blood is drained into the bowl with that of the chicken. In this way the fluid of life represented by the baby, chicken, and the spirit of the devil, represented by the snake, are mingled. Their mystical powers are released. This divine mixture will be drunk by members of the group who will then be exorcized of their sins. They will fall to the ground in what is said to be a hypnotic catatonic state, their eyes opened in a glazed stare. In this state they can commit no evil, commit no sins. They can do no wrong. (dramatic tribal drum music) (worshipers whooping) While the old laws of voodoo have changed, the old hexes, gris-gris, and dolls with pins have fallen into disuse, the primeval sensuality and spirit of wanton abandonment remain. Voodoo provides a release from the restrictions and inhibitions of civilization. Many of the people here not only do not believe in voodoo, but do not observe any of the rules concerning the ceremony itself. They are here it seems for nothing more than a weird social gathering. (dramatic tribal drum music) (worshipers whooping) Discretion compels us to bid adieu to Nassau at this point, for while these people may be civilized, most of us are not civilized enough ourselves to accept some of the more engaging aspects of their strange, mystical rites. (dramatic tribal drum music) (worshipers whooping) (suspenseful music) And now we journey to the distant Orient, the inscrutable East, Land of the Rising Sun. The Japanese Empire has and to service its 96 million people, has 534 colleges and universities and 7,220 massage parlors. This is Kyoto. This is one of the many massage parlors in the city. With permission of the management, we have installed hidden cameras in both this reception room and one of the massage booths. Our curiosity in Japan and its numerous massage parlors was prompted by a growing interest in what is commonly referred to as the special massage. There were 14 massage booths, each about 12 feet square. A hole was cut through the thin wall of an adjoining massage room where our camera was placed. A two-way mirror was hung over the hole. It is now possible for our camera to see through the mirror into the room. Because of the low light level in the room itself, a high-speed black and white film was used for this sequence. This man does not know he is being photographed. He is one of many American businessmen who expect to find a more permissive atmosphere here than in the massage parlors back home. For the legend persists that here one may obtain a special massage of such rare delights as to make one's visit to the Orient joyously memorable. It is quite apparent that this gentleman is in no way interested in the aggressive activity that this young lady is providing. It matters not to him that she's been well-trained from childhood in customary geisha fashion in the art of massage and that she knows every muscle of the body and exactly what pressures are required to relax the nerves and stimulate the blood flow. The stimulation this gentleman is desirous of is of quite a different nature, but the young lady speaks no English and the man obviously speaks no Japanese. (massage machine buzzing) Patience, especially in the Orient, is a virtue. (soft orchestral music) (massage machine buzzing) Finally, he makes his point and he settles down to thoughts of a more amorous nature. He is hoping that his first special massage shall be something to be forever treasured. It is the answer to a silent prayer. The special massage girl is lovelier than he had hoped. Now it's only a matter of time. She prepares herself for the job with the grace of a ballerina. (raunchy rock music) ''I can give you everything I got'' ''I can't expect to give what I have not'' ''I can only give you lovin' 'til the sun goes down'' ''And until the leaves of summer turn to shades of brown'' - [Narrator] Finally, everything is ready and he knows it is about to begin. ''I can't argue with you to understand'' '''Cause after all I am just a man'' ''You are on my mind when stars appear and shadows fall'' ''And when every little flower close and no birds call'' - [Narrator] Beyond doubt, this special massage will leave a lasting impression. ''Baby you know that I can only give ya everything'' - [Narrator] In addition to culture, Kyoto is also one of the key manufacturing cities in the Japanese Empire. It is, for example, one of the largest exporters of women's undergarments in the world. And this is one of the most successful mail order operations in the United States with headquarters in Hollywood, California. Founder and president of the organization is Mr. Frederick, a man whose unique design capabilities have made him the most successful underwear salesman in the world. (soft orchestral music) His mail order operation has grown to be one of those remarkable American success stories. We asked Mr. Frederick to tell us about his fantastic organization in his own words. - [Mr. Frederick] This is our catalog, the lifeblood of our business. This is two to three years ahead of its time. We're supplying our customers with exactly what they want. We were the first major distributor of braziers in America that had pushup pads in them. In addition, we supplied padded braziers for women in the larger bust sizes who want to look younger not just bigger. We felt the B cups might wanna look like Cs and the C cups like Ds, and we found that we weren't wrong. Also, our specialty items add a great deal of interest in our catalog. The girdle, for example, with the open seat was designed because I do not like a woman in a pair of capris to have a buttressed, cemented in look. We give her the support where she needs it, in the tummy and hips, and we cut it out where it appears undesirable. We developed the hole in the middle bra for the same reason. We make periodic quality checks using live models with known sizes. The Frederick's catalog is sent to all of our customers six times a year at a yearly postage cost to us of $150,000. 90% of our customers are women, 60% of whom are married, and of that group, 50% had two or more children. Our mailing list consists of over a million names and we service people in over 71 foreign countries. Our mail order department employs approximately 300 people. All mail is opened on the day it arrives. If it gets in early enough, it's possible for the item to be on its way to the customer the next day. - [Narrator] Frederick's is an industrial symphony, a medley of machinery, letters, and underwear. (dramatic orchestral music) If the human spirit is divine as Dante said, then the temple of that spirit is the human body. We journey now to Sydney, Australia to witness a demonstration of the mysterious powers of the mind and their effect on the human body. These members of the press and the medical profession are gathered here at the University of Sydney to investigate the claims of Jack Schwarz, a Dutchman, who has the amazing ability to prevent disease and infection in his body. Mr. Schwarz makes no claims to be a mystic or a fakir. He is, he says, "Just an ordinary person like you or me." However, he has learned to control and use the magic powers of his subconscious mind through meditation so that he only requires two hours sleep per night. He eats only three full meals per week, yet he is just an ordinary man as you or I. Mr. Schwarz claims that he makes no use of self-hypnosis in controlling his body, but relies more on a positive method of concentration which might be referred to as a mental local anesthetic. The principal device for his experiments is a bed of nails. This bed of nails contains only 17 very rusty nails. The traditional bed of nails of the Indian fakir numbers between 40 and 80 nails. The fewer the nails, the deeper they penetrate the flesh. In addition, these nails are in no way sterilized. (suspenseful music) And for those who are skeptical of the slow exertion of 242 pounds on Mr. Schwarz's stomach, we offered a 50 pound boulder which will be struck with a Sledgehammer, creating an instantaneous impact reaction equal to 750 pounds. (man grunts) (Sledgehammer thuds) A close examination by doctors confirms that a complete penetration of the flesh has been achieved, yet no blood has been drawn and the wounds themselves will be totally healed within a half hour. How does he do it? By directing his mind, he 'says,' "in a spirit of meditation to the affirmative emotions of life." However, for those of you who remain skeptical, Mr. Schwarz shall now run a carpet needle into the side of his face. Once again, sterilization of the implement is not considered, even to the point of rubbing it into the carpeting. Those of you who have queasy stomachs may wish to avert your eyes at this moment. Mr. Schwarz believes each of us is divine, each of us is our own God. By meditating on the beauty and love of our own being, we cleanse ourselves of the negative emotions that induce fear, despair, and disease. Finally, he prepares to drive the second needle through his forearm. A member of the press is invited to spit on it. This is indeed an unsterilized instrument. For those who would attempt this feat, remember you must first learn the art of meditation. For only by mastering your own mind can you hope to gain mastery of your body. Then perhaps you, too, can sleep only two hours a night, eat only three full meals a week, and stick pins in your cheeks. (upbeat music) (glass breaks) (glass crunching) (man belches) (upbeat music) (glass crunching) (man gulps) (glass crunching) (man gulps) (upbeat music) (man belches) (suspenseful music) Where, in all this marvelous, amazing world, can we find life more bizarre than in your own front yard? 60 years ago this was the small, sleepy Western town of El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora de los Angeles. Today it is the sprawling megalopolis of Los Angeles, the largest city in the Western Hemisphere. Nowhere in the world are there more automobiles. Nowhere has growth been more continuous, has the urban sprawl been more persistent, have the wide open spaces been more completely devoured by the unending influx of outsiders migrating here for the good life. 50 years ago these houses would be standing on vacant land, interspersed with vast groves of orange trees. Today, the motorcar dominates life in Southern California. This is Sunset Boulevard, legendary street of dreams and myths. Young people from all over the world are drawn here by the glamour of the film industry, for this is Hollywood, now just a small section of Los Angeles. Here are the fabled clubs and watering places of the celebrated. Nearby are the apartment houses and homes for those who work in Hollywood. (dramatic orchestral music) Ah, some of them at least find time to take a bit of the sun, when the smog will permit. It is here in this great Los Angeles Basin that we find the elusive search for love and fulfillment taking forms never dreamed of by Michelangelo, Shakespeare, or Dante. This is Main Street, only eight blocks from City Hall. Our camera is concealed in a bakery truck. We are watching two homosexual male prostitutes waiting for the first contact of the evening. (jaunty orchestral music) Soliciting is against the law here. One has to be cautious in selecting a companion for the evening. Enlargements of still photographs taken at this time indicate that the driver of the car is a male. (soft orchestral music) Careful. Make certain that you aren't being watched. Ah well, perhaps next time. (soft orchestral music) La Cienega Boulevard in Beverly Hills might well be considered the Greenwich Village of the West. On this street one may find a painting to suit every mood, to fulfill all desires, and to fit every pocketbook. Sir Julian Huxley once said that the role of the artist "is to provide variety to our lives, thus our lives are enriched and ennobled." Los Angeles has become the cultural center of the West. These paintings present a traditional approach to the artist's creative vision. Prices for these paintings range from $100 to about $1,000. Almost directly across the street we find the works of modern artist Ellsworth Kelly. This painting is priced at $5,000 and is cleverly entitled Red and Blue. (singing in foreign language) This work is priced at $6,000. It is entitled Red, Green, and Blue. The creative experience takes many forms. This theater houses another collection of the West's cultural heritage. 'Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah... - [Narrator] Art reflects life and life imitates art. These paintings belong in the collection of one very wealthy theater owner. They represent his concept of genuine creative expression. (singing in foreign language) But what of the artists themselves, the creators of beauty, the providers of variety? What are they doing? (upbeat rock music) This 60-foot tower was created by sculptor Mark di Suvero of New York in protest against America's involvement in the unpleasantness in Vietnam. A committee of artists contacted painters all over the world to participate in this protest. Over one million dollars worth of paintings created by 200 internationally famous artists adorn the exhibit and give voice to their indignation. Dedication ceremonies heard veterans of the Vietnam War add their voices to those of the artists. (upbeat piano music) ''Protest'' ''Whoa it's the thing to do'' ''There must be somethin' buggin' you'' ''Protest'' ''We gonna start today'' ''So get out your signs, form the picket lines'' ''And lead the way'' ''We're gonna save the world'' ''We're gonna save the world'' ''Have you thought at all about the bomb this week'' ''Did you talk to the mountain'' ''Did you smile at the queen'' ''In Vietnam and all the blood that's spilled there'' ''Stay in school, babe'' ''You might get killed there'' ''And protest'' ''Whoa it's the thing to do'' ''There must be'' ''Somethin' buggin' you'' ''Protest'' ''Use a big word or two'' ''Contemplation, indignation, and frustration, too'' ''We're gonna save the world'' ''We're gonna save the world, babe'' (twangy rock music) - [Narrator] But there were other voices, too. Counter pickets stage a protest against the protest. The Young Americans For Freedom vigorously support the government's position in Vietnam. The signs they carry represent no artistic endeavors, and at present market prices are totally valueless, but the messages they contain are most assuredly definite statements of their beliefs. (fly buzzing) ''Grab that fly'' (hand smacking) - [Narrator] This in turn inspires a counter protest against their protest of the artists' protest. (fly buzzing) - Right there. - [Narrator] If this seems confusing, try to bear with us, for after all this is part of the variety that the artist contributes to our lives. (fly buzzing) - [Man] Wait, sir. (fly buzzing) (men muttering) (fly buzzing) - [Man] Wait, sir. (fly buzzing) (men muttering) Oh, I give up. - [Narrator] An old Oriental proverb says the more life changes the more it remains the same. The tower is gone. The arguments have been hot and impassioned. On this day in Vietnam 37 Americans lost their lives while here only a small echo of protest could be heard. ''Protest'' ''Oh it's the thing to do'' ''There must be somethin' buggin' you'' ''Protest'' ''We're gonna start today'' ''So get out the signs, form the picket lines'' ''And lead the way'' ''We're gonna save the world'' ''We're gonna save the world'' (soft rock music) - [Narrator] Art in Los Angeles is by no means restricted to the professional. This art class is at this moment attended solely by housewives, most of whom are aged over 40. It is not however a prerequisite that you be a housewife to enjoy the advantages of this particular class, or for that matter that you be over the age of 40. It is only necessary that you apply yourself to the full development of individual artistic expression. (sultry jazz music) This is Vito, a sculptor, painter, poet, dancer, and photographer, truly a Renaissance man. His approach to the arts is joyously creative and spontaneous. (camera clicks) (camera clicks) (camera clicks) - [Vito] My name is Vito and I'm a sculptor and the figure that you see here is a glass construction entitled Bending Dancer. I cut out photographs of girls and paste them on pieces of glass, then I glue the pieces together onto the figure, which is two-thirds life size. (upbeat music) I also do more conventional kinds of sculpture. This is my protest against prejudice and intolerance in the world. I believe that we should love one another rather than hate. I believe in peace rather than war. I try to put that into my work. Now, I'd consider myself as a deviant from the norm. The word deviant is considered an unhealthy word in our culture, but without the so called deviant, man long would have perished, because the deviant is the one who brings an element of beauty, an element of aesthetics into the world, and without beauty it's pointless for man to exist. I'm interested in adding some (camera clicks) Element of design to my general attitude in life. Otherwise it's a bore and mundane and I'm not particularly interested in it. Many people think that I'm some kind of a nut, but I don't care just as long as they buy my sculpture. (soft orchestral music) - [Narrator] The sprawling megalopolis of Los Angeles offers a variety of hedonistic experience. This is Balboa, a playground for millionaires and just everyday folks like you and me. Once a year a strange mating right takes place on these seemingly innocent shores. For just as the seals return annually to the Bering Straits and the swallows return to Capistrano, so do tens of thousands of young teenagers converge on Balboa at Easter time to indulge their youthful energies in drinking, dancing, flirting, and well, just about everything else. Here beyond the watchful eyes of parents and school authorities they learn the facts of life in their first awkward gropings towards maturity. The small police force is reinforced to many times its normal compliment. State Highway troopers and officers from communities all over California help to at least control, if not subdue, the youthful vigor of the teenagers. (upbeat music) Every vehicle is pressed into the service of the police, including even the dog Catcher's truck. Road blocks are set up at major approaches and suspicious looking vehicles are searched for alcohol or drugs. Hundreds are arrested, the charges ranging from drunkenness to indecent exposure. In order to better understand this modern mating ritual we interviewed some of the participants. - Where'd you come from? - [Teenager] Las Vegas, Nevada. - Did you drive down in your own car? - [Teenager] Yes, I did. - [Interviewer] Where are you living while you're here? - [Teenager] We have a room, motel room. - How many of you share the room? [Teenager] 14. - 14! - Have you had any parties since you've been here? - [Teenager] Every night. - [Interviewer] When are you going home? - [Teenager] When the money runs out. - [Interviewer] How much do you pay for this hotel room? - [Teenager] About 70 cents apiece, 85 cents apiece. - [Interviewer] How old are you? - [Teenager] How old am I? 18. - [Interviewer] Has anybody been down here the whole week? - Oh, I have. (crowd chattering) I'm down here every day every year. - [Girl] I have. - [Interviewer] Say the cops haven't gotten you yet? - [Girl] Not yet, no not yet. - [Interviewer] Do you expect the cops? - [Girl] Yes, I do. (chuckles) - She's been picked at before. - Why? - [Girl] Because I always expect them to get me. - [Girl] I got a ticket the other day. - [Interviewer] What for? - [Girl] For riding in the back of a Jeep, hanging out the end. - Yeah, we had to pay for this guy's ticket. - [Interviewer] Do the police give you much trouble, generally? - [Girl] Yes, I hate 'em. - [Interviewer] What do they give you trouble about? - [Girl] They yell at you for walkin' down the street the wrong way. (chuckles) - [Girl] I know, I hate 'em. They're no good. - Like, you're doin' anything and you get in trouble. - [Teenager] Here are my knobbies. - [Interviewer] Where, let me see. - [Teenager] All right, wanna see my knobbies? Calcium deposits, you see. I'm not going in the Army for them. - [Interviewer] Why, because you can't wear boots, right? - [Teenager] Better than bein' a conscientious objector. - [Interviewer] Now, what are you doing for a living? - [Teenager] I don't do anything. - [Interviewer] Well how do you exist? - [Teenager] Oh, we go down to the beach there and clam dig Saturdays and just take it over to the market, they give ya steaks for it. - [Interviewer] And what about a place to live? How do you exist? - [Teenager] Well, there's a number of guys go together on one place and it doesn't cost that much. - [Girl] Can you? - [Interviewer] What does it cost you? - [Teenager] About $4 a week. - [Interviewer] Do ya stay down here any nights? - [Girl] Yeah. - [Interviewer] Where do ya stay when ya stay here? - [Girl] The beach. - [Interviewer] You sleep on the beach? - [Girl] Yeah. (boy muttering) - That sounds great. - [Girl] Yeah, it's fun. - [Interviewer] Do the police give you any trouble? - [Girl] No, they don't bother me 'cause I don't let 'em. - [Interviewer] Well how do you not let them? - [Girl] Because if they talk to me I just plug my ears and say, "Don't talk to me." - [Interviewer] And then they just leave you alone from that point, is that right? - [Girl] Yeah, because they think I'm nice. - [Boy] Last night, the cops are always buggin' guys. - [Interviewer] Why is that? - [Boy] I don't know why, man. They don't respect the guys. All the kids respect the cops, but the cops don't respect the kids down there. There's two cops here and two cops there and all over, man. - [Interviewer] What do you wanna do for a living? - [Boy] I don't know. - [Interviewer] How old are ya? - [Boy] 18. - [Interviewer] What do you do for excitement? - [Boy] (chuckles) Surf, usually sit down here and play my guitar. - [Interviewer] Where do you go to school? - [Girl] Phoenix, Arizona. - [Interviewer] Did you come out here just for the Easter week? - [Girl] Yes. Can be kind of a drag. I'm glad I'm goin' home. (laughs) - [Interviewer] Phoenix is better. - [Girl] Well, no. (laughs) Think I'm goin' to New York next time I go on a vacation. - [Narrator] Watch out, New York, you may be next. (dramatic orchestral music) Man's endless search for fulfillment takes many forms, but nowhere is it more bizarre than in Europe's most highly industrialized nation, Germany. Here in the busy seaport city of Hamburg citizens gather to watch a play about the sick world of the days of Hitler entitled Heil Deutschland. (woman humming) This actress portrays a Jewish girl who has apparently been hiding in this attic for months. Baby Baby (door clicks) (girl gasps) (suspenseful orchestral music) (audience applauds) (dramatic orchestral music) Written by a former Nazi playwright, Karl Hofstede, this play has been running for 14 years to capacity audiences. Under the guise of exposing the evils of the Nazi era, this blatantly anti-Semitic drama even offers recordings of Hitler's voice and songs of the dreaded Nazi SS stormtroopers during the performance. (suspenseful orchestral music) What forbidden emotions lurk in the hearts of this audience as they relive the sick days of Hitler? What dark forces lie brooding within, waiting for the opportunity to once again burst forth on the world? Perhaps this play will give us a hint. (suspenseful drum roll music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (hand slapping) (girl crying out) (speaking in foreign language) (crowd cheers) (whip thwacks) (girl cries out) (speaking in foreign language) (crowd cheering) (Whip thwacking) (girl crying out) (singing in foreign language) (Whip thwacking) (girl crying out) (singing in foreign language) (Whip thwacking) (girl crying out) (singing in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (crowd cheering) (suspenseful music) But lest we become too involved in horrors of the past, let us now appraise the bizarre of the here and now. Our quest next takes us to distant Lebanon, bordering on the blue Mediterranean. Let us hear from Mr. George Fillmore, a member of the Arabian expedition team via transatlantic telephone. - [George] We picked up this Arab who was to guide us to the slave trading area and drove all night, about 119 kilometers out of Beirut. It's wild country, no roads to speak of, no maps or telephones, nothing, and we only had this Arab's word to go by. We were a little strung up about the situation because Muslim law is very strict. They shoot slave traders on the spot, and of course they consider us infidels. This Arab, his name was Fuad, he showed us the place to set up our cameras. It's way up in the side of the mountain, very steep, and he also pointed out to us the spot that the slave auction was supposed to take place in. He showed us where to unload our equipment and of course we had little choice but to follow him. We unloaded the equipment very fast. The sooner we got it out of the van, the safer it was for us. There was an awful lot of it, not just camera gear, but sound recording stuff, cables. Well, we had a lot of hauling to do and there was a few heavy things like the big pulley rope to get it up the mountain. After that we drove the empty van out of there and around the other side of the ridge where it would be out of sight but still handy just in case we had to scamper over the ridge to get out of there. Now that I think of it, it wouldn't have been much use. It would've probably been a rotten carve up. Fuad helped us lash up the equipment securely to the sled. We had brought the bare minimum, but it still seemed like a ton. We tied on a few extra ropes just in case, and in the meantime the van was being hidden just over the other side of the ridge. We needed a volunteer to go up the mountain and I was the lucky one who was selected. It was fairly easy at the beginning but I soon found out that we were gonna have a problem because it was all loose gravel up there. And you know you take two steps up and one step back. It was actually easier going up on all fours. It was very frustrating and I seemed to be making no progress at all. However, I knew the clock was ticking and we just had to get on with it. I think we were all getting nervous now because we still hadn't got the stuff up the hill yet. I fastened the rope around the tree and I started back down. It was very loose and slippery on that hill and that's when I lost my balance. (frenetic jazz drum music) I thought me number's up, but as it turned out I'd just winded me self and I got a bit of a scrape on the leg. A few moments later I was back at it, pulling on the rope to get that equipment up the hill. Time was against us. We set up the camouflage net first. We had a definite plan to follow and we more or less followed that right to the letter. We had three cameras, one was a spare, and we used that just to photograph ourselves settin' up the equipment. One camera had a 1,000 millimeter lens that was so powerful you could almost pick up the hairs on a flea's back legs at about a mile and a half. We got it set up while Fuad stood watch and kept his eyes skinned. We'd also gotten hold of a Morrison Senior teledynamic microphone. We got it from the military. It's got a tremendous range. You can focus it into an area up to two and a half kilometers away. It'll pick up the sounds and bring 'em back. It's really unbelievable. After quite a lot of work we got all set up and ready to go, and then it was my job to cross the ridge, find me self a look over there and act as lookout. The country is rough, very, very barren and dry actually, very dry, and it's just crazy to be out there. (suspenseful traditional stringed music) I was in a position to see 'em coming and as soon as I saw the first truck at about 1:30 in the afternoon, I waved and then I ducked down and I kept outta sight. (engines rumbling) - [Narrator] Due to atmospheric conditions, we were unable to pick up all the sounds with the teledynamic microphone. The great distance from the source caused the sound to be somewhat delayed. (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic traditional music) (speaking in foreign language) This limousine suggests that this will be no ordinary slave auction, for this is royalty. However, discretion compels that we obscure the license plate lest we offend a friendly country and precipitate an international incident. Slave trading in this area is one of those great open secrets that no one talks about. It has been estimated that more than three million Lebanese pounds are spent annually for the purchase of human flesh. That is about one million American dollars. Unlike the slave trade in America in the 18003, these slaves are not intended for manual labor. Rather, they will probably find their way into the brothels of the Middle East where they will provide the physical incarnation of love. It is true that the human body is, in Michelangelo's words, the form divine. However, such is the atmosphere of prudity and repression in our country that we can not reveal this scene as our cameras saw it. Many hours of painfully slow labor have been expended to obscure the offensive parts from the view of the prurient minded. (speaking in foreign language) (soft traditional Middle Eastern music) (speaking in foreign language) This poor creature was sold for 4,000 pounds, about 1,750 American dollars, or for less than a good used car.
