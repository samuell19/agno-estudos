Perfect. What do you think? Nice, right? It's... okay. No, hold it, it will soon be yours. Four million Naira. Three-four. My friend, that is too low. Three-five. Okay, three-nine, because I like you. Three-six, that's my final offer. Come now, work with me! My friend bought a car just like this for three-five. No, the mileage on this car and that car are not the same. See the odometer. No one would sell a car like this for three-five, no one! Three-six is what I want to pay. Three-seven. What is holding you? I need more time to think about it. Think about what? You're not going to find a better car... than this, not for three point seven million, not in Lagos! I'll give you my answer tomorrow. You're not the only one eyeing this car. Four others are seeing it tonight! By tomorrow it will not be here, I promise you. We'll see. Where are you going, my friend? Are we good? Yes. Date, sign, print your name, sign it, date. You see, I told you it would be yours! Oh, where is the spare key? It's in the glove compartment. How far? Just drive! How much did we make? Drive! Next! What's the purpose of your visit? Visiting family. We need that baggage quick, please. Baggage claim? Yeah. Okay, coming. Okay. Excuse me... where do I pick up my luggage? Uh, can I see your ticket? Yeah. Your luggage will arrive at the one behind me, okay? Thank you. Once you pick up your luggage, go to customs. They already stamped my passport. Customs must also clear your luggage... before you can leave the airport. Appreciate it, thank you. Also make sure you give them a little something... unless they will delay you. Something like what? Something. You mean money. Of course. Is that legal? This is not America. Is $10 okay? They usually take $20. We'll they have change? It's okay, don't worry, I'll tell them to settle for $10. Okay. I could give it to them, so you don't have to wait in line. Go to baggage claim, once you're done from there, I'll meet you. Thank you. You have to unlock your phone before you can use it. Thanks. Is this your first time here? Yeah. American? Yeah. Nigerian-American? Yeah, where you from? Australia. What are you doing here? Business. How about you? You visiting family? Nah, my mom just wants me out the house for the summer. How long are you here for? Four weeks. Well, you're lucky! Not a lot of people have the opportunity to travel... especially at your age... I didn't. What's your name? Eze, but people call me Eazy. Wallace. Nice to meet you. Take care of yourself, mate. You, too. Hey, I know a guy that can get you through customs, quick! And he's cheap. Sorry, I'm not following you. You have to pay customs on your way out... so they won't keep you waiting. Did you give somebody your money? Yeah. Who told you that? Don't worry about it, it's just ten bucks. No, it's okay, just point him out. All right, wait here. Sorry, excuse me. What did you say to him? I told him I work for the UN. You work for the UN? No, but I'm the only white man here... so he has to think I'm of some importance. I'll wait for you. Appreciate it. So what do you do? I used to work as an accountant, now I handle trust funds. There is a lot of cheap money in Nigeria. It's a great place to do business... if you know how to play the game. That's my driver. Here's my card. If you have questions, call me. Appreciate it. Have a good night, mate. You, too. Eze! Hello. Aw... let's go. How long was your flight? 12 hours. You must be tired. You look so much like your mother. Everyone says that. My son looks nothing like me. It's okay, it comes off and on. The electricity? Yes, it's normal. Where's my room? Here, take a lantern, follow me. Where are you sleeping? We're sharing the bed? Yes. Can you call my mom? It's ringing. Is he there? Yeah. Eze? Hey, Mom. Oh, thank God! When did you land? Ah... two hours ago. And you're just now calling me? The phone you gave me isn't working! It needs to be unlocked. Where are you? Grace's apartment. Auntie Grace's apartment. Auntie Grace's apartment only has one bed? You didn't tell me that! She doesn't bite. And there is no electricity. That's Nigeria for you! Why don't they just leave the power on? Because some people very high up won't allow that. Auntie Grace is a lawyer?! I told you what she does! I forgot! She's a professor. How old is her son? That's a good question... I don't know. You said his dad is dead, right? Yeah, a long time ago. How did he die? Sickle-cell. Hey, Mom, so how does Auntie Grace use the internet... when the power is off? She doesn't, in fact, I don't even think she has internet. Mom... why am I doing here? We talked about this. I don't want to stay here for four weeks. You're there to learn who you are and where you're from. Give it time, eh? Can I just stay for two weeks instead? Mom? Hello? Dearest one... with due respect and humanity, I am compelled to write... to you under a humanitarian ground. My husband is the late Mr. John Papamichael... founder of J.P. Industries, Cote D'ivoire, West Africa. Before passing last year, my husband left me... with an inheritance of ten million U.S. dollars. Unfortunately, shortly after receiving my inheritance... my doctor revealed to me that I will not last... the next six months due to liver cancer. Having come to terms with my condition... I have decided to donate the money to a kind-hearted... God-fearing individual, who will utilize the fund... to help the less privileged and to propagate the word of God. Seeing as I do not have any children or next of kin... to inherit my fortune, I feel comfortable... making the decision to release my money to you. Hope to hear from you soon. God Bless, Mrs. Angeliki Papamichael. I'm going to the market, are you coming? No! Are you jet-lagged? Your breakfast is ready in the living room. Eat it there. I don't want crumbs in my bed. Mm-hm. What are you here to do? Where are you come from? I don't know what you're saying! Sorry, my mother does not usually have guests... over when she is away. Can we keep what happened to your laptop between us? Do not worry, I will buy you a newer and better one, I promise. My name is Pius. Can you hand me the remote? Sit. Do you know why I brought you here? No, sir. I brought you here to tell you that this, your scamming... thing that you're doing, it's not the right business for you. You're far too stupid to make any money from such a business. Don't look at him! I am the one talking. Don't I protect you? Answer! Yes, sir! Then why is it that you don't want to include me... in this, your thing? Sir, which thing is this? Do you think that Indian man will not be able to recognize... you, if I put you in a line up? He does not only want me to lock you up... he wants me to chop off your head. And he has given me money to make sure that it happens. And it will happen! Please, sir, forgive me, it will never happen again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. Take him. Sir! Sir... I will pay you back all of it now! With interest! Wait! I want four million. Okay. In five days. Sir... five days is not enough time. Five days... wait! Wait, wait! Okay, four million in five days! Why are you in the dark? The batteries in the lantern are dead. Use the kerosene lantern. I don't know how. Pick up the matches! Pull this handle. This one? Yes, that one. Strike the match. Put it there. Pull back the handle. That's it? That's it. Have you had a bath? You don't have a shower. Follow me. Don't forget to bring the lantern! You want me to bathe you, too? What happened to your computer? Why are you going through my things? Did my son do this? He will pay for this. It wasn't him! Then how did it happen? The lights cut off and I couldn't see where I was going. Are you telling me you knocked it over? Yes. Get dressed, we're going out. I'm good. Don't test me! What's your problem? I'm not your mother, you hear me? The next time, it will be boiling water. Why don't you like coming outside? It's a beautiful day. I like jerking off too much. What does that mean? It means watching TV. Yes, it's true, you jerk off too much. Where are we going? Don't worry, you'll like it. How much longer? I'm beginning to feel hungry. We just got here. We have been here a whole two hours! Well, these computers are slow! Is this why we are still here? I didn't ask to come. Mm... if you don't like it, we can leave! Are you always like this? Always like what? You may think I'm strict... but I've seen what happens to a child when a parent is lenient. I'm not your son. I know, but both of you are the same... very stubborn. I'm sure you saw that in him when you met him yesterday. How do you know we met? Because he has my spare key. He sneaks into the house from time to time for food. He didn't seem stubborn. Well, trust me, he is. So what does he do for work? He's an email scammer. But he can scam you in other ways, though. That's why I was asking if he broke your laptop. Because he can take advantage of that and scam you, too. You understand? So does your son ever come here to scam? Here? Nah, their computer is too slow for him. What is wrong with you? This is disgusting! It is good food. You think this is good food?! What do you call good food, American food, eh? This is Nigeria, this is Nigerian food. I'm not Nigerian, I'm American. Both your parents are Nigerian, from Igbo state... Igboland! Nigerian blood flows through your veins. You can't change that, so stop trying. I don't want to eat this, can I order something else? You must finish it! I can't wait till this is over. Better get ready, this is just the beginning. What do you mean, it's just the beginning? Hm? What did you mean by that? Nothing. Let me use your phone, I want to call my mom. Can't you see I'm eating? Can I please use your phone?! Hello? Mom! Hi, honey. I have a question. I'm only staying here for four weeks, right? Why are you asking? Mom, just tell me the truth. No. Get out of my way! Where are you going? Move! You think you want to go home, how? Can you move? I'll move if you tell me how. I'm going to the airport! To do what? To upgrade my return flight. Your mother canceled it the day you arrived. I want to call my mom. You can call her tomorrow. I'm tired. Is Henry here? Yes. Henry, why did you give me a duplicate... when I asked you for an original? Originals are traceable, duplicates are not. But duplicates are twice the cost. Give me back my money! I will deduct it from your next job. Whose job is this? None of your business. You never told me you could make black money. This is very good work, who is the Mugu? Why are you here? I need you to call Baba. Why? I need you to locate him for me. Locate him yourself. He's not answering my calls. Because of Smart? Word travels fast. Well, the faster you make this call, the faster I leave. Hello. Hello, Mercy, your son says he wants to speak to you. Tell him I'll call him later. He says it's an emergency. Fine. Hold on. Mom. Honey, are you okay? I want to come home. I was told this was an emergency. You lied to me! Would you have gone otherwise? That's not the point! It's just for a year. When you graduate, you can come back. Is this because of that fight? Like I said before... Oh my god, I know who I am and where I'm from! Then why are you afraid to call yourself Nigerian, eh? Alright, you win, I'm Nigerian! Now can I please come home? I have to be at work in four hours. Let's talk about this later. If you're dialing America, add one to the numbers. You have reached... the voice mailbox of... Kingsley Okocha. Please record your voice message. Dad, give me a call when you get this message. It's an emergency. Are you done? Instead of looking for ways to leave, why not stop... and think of why your mother sent you here. You think she came up with this idea overnight? No. She's been planning this day since... since! You're here because she wants you here. The earlier you get that into your head, the better for you. Take your food, eat, get dressed. We have a very busy day ahead. Where are we going? To your new school. We are partners. I have a new partner. Oh, this clown? Why are you calling me a clown? Just get into the car. Get inside now! I cannot help you! You know the type of trouble I'm in now. I need money fast! Don't follow me. At least tell me what you're doing? Come now, who's the Mugu? The Ikotun Irepodun Market. You're selling all this at the market? How much are you selling it for? Half-off. How much did you buy the rice for? Full price. You bought this rice full price, but you're selling it half-off? Have you gone mad? How will you profit? After all of this rice is sold... there will be people, lots of people... who wanted rice but didn't get. It's not everyday that one finds a deal like this in Lagos. Those who missed out will jump... at the next opportunity to buy that rice. This is that opportunity. I will take pre-orders from those who missed out. Give them this ticket to claim their rice from four... additional trucks that will arrive shortly after I leave. So, what's the scam? Do you see any additional trucks here? You know I can help you sell this rice fast, add me! My friend, my friend... Wait! How much did he put in for the rice? Why? I'll cover the entire cost of the rice... and we can share the profits 50/50. Okay, 60/40! Get in. It's nothing personal, this is just business. Now get out! I said get out! Stay here, don't say a word to anybody. Once they hear your accent... the money for your admission will increase. I thought this school was free? Nothing is free in this country, so ssh, stay, mm? Yes? It is not his money! You should run, this is not a joke. He doesn't want me dead, he just wants money. I am too valuable for him to kill. Oh, so that's your young friend who's chained in his office... is he valuable too? Just tell me what we are doing next? You're doing a 'Wash-Wash'. I know that scam very well, you know that! I can handle this myself. How much more of that black money do you need? Why? Because I can give you 10,000 more black bills... to help make your scam look more convincing. You have that much? Yes, from an old scam. Ten thousand! Not eight, not nine, 10,000! Okay! Now tell me your scam. Dear friend, I am an Accounting Manager... at the Nigerian Development Bank. I want my bank to release... three million dollars worth of black money to you. What is black money, you may be asking? Black money is genuine money that has been coated... with a special black substance to give it the appearance... and texture of black construction paper. By doing this, one can transport a large sum... of money in plain sight anywhere around the globe. In order to return black money to its original state... one simply needs to wash the money in a chemical bath. After the black money is released, I would like... for you to make a brief visit to Nigeria to be convinced... that it is indeed genuine U.S. currency. If you are satisfied with its genuineness, together we... will purchase the rest of the chemicals needed to wash... three million dollars worth of black money. And also note that you will have 40 percent... of the above-mentioned sum if you agree to handle this... business with me. I am expecting your urgent... response as soon as you receive my message. Best Regard, Mr. Edgar Adu. Who's the Mugu? Bob Matthews. An American? Yeah. Is he here in Lagos? Yes, he arrived last night. What does he do? HVAC... heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. He's a repair man? No! He's a small business owner! I'm telling you, this man is loaded! His company services homes, businesses... hospitals, you name it. How much can we get from him? A least $5,000, easy! How are we splitting this? 70/30. Non-negotiable! That's too small! You're not the only one who needs money. When are we doing it? In two days. When's Smart's money due? In three days. Then you'll be fine! 7:00 a.m. outside at the Palm Hotel... and don't forget to bring the ten thousand! And Pius! Please look the part. What was that? He told me not to tell you. Yes. Okay, but can I use your phone first? You want to call your mother? Yes. Okay. Hello? Hey, who's that? That's Bimbo, my neighbor's daughter. She's taking you to school. Tuck in your shirt! So, you're not taking me to school? No, I am going to work, now go, you'll be late. Is her name really Bimbo? Yes... go! Can I ask you a question? Yeah, what's up? Why are you schooling in Nigeria? My mom says I'm here because I don't know who I am... but I'm really here, cause I got into a fight at school. So you were sent to my school as punishment? Exactly! Are you making a joke?! No! My school is one of the best schools in Nigeria. You're not American, you wouldn't understand. Why do people call you Bimbo? Bimbo is short for Abimbola. It means, born wealthy, in Yoruba. Do you know what "bimbo" means in America? I don't care! Why not? I'm not American, I won't understand. I-I'm sorry! So, is walking with me to school part of your punishment? Yeah, it's the worst part. This is the first day, why is your bag so heavy? Eze! It was nice talking to you. Where are you going? Wait, wait, wait, just, just, just turn around. Come now, turn around! Can we go now? Oh, you look beautiful. I was surprised you called me last night. I take it my mother does not know you're with me? So, what do you do for a living? I think you know what I do. You're a Nigerian scammer? You can just say scammer. What made you want to become a scammer? When I was in school, I needed money. How long have you been doing it? 12 years. 12 years... are you ever gonna stop? You think what I'm doing is bad, am I right? You don't think it's bad? I'll be honest with you, I know it's bad, but I do not care. The people I scam, they're just as bad as me. They think they can make money without working for it. They're fools. Did you ever scam your mom? No, not intentionally... but that's not what she thinks. So, is that why she doesn't want you around me? No, my mother doesn't want us together... because I am not at the top of my chosen profession. What?! You see that man? Nobody wants to be him. No child grows up and says I want to be the man... who pushes the wheelbarrow. But if that man starts making money... everyone will be pushing wheelbarrows. To the average Nigerian, only thing that matters is money. Money, money, money, money! I do what I do so I can make money. So scammers really make money? Of course! 419 is big business. 419? 419 is the Nigerian criminal code for scammers. You understand? And here scammers don't call themselves scammers, no... we call ourselves Niners Yahoo-boys, G-boys! Why G-boys? Like game boy... because scamming is a game. So people really fall for these email scams? Ask yourself this, do you think those who scam would waste... their time sending you those emails... if they were not making a profit? Maybe. Most people think it's only the old who fall for scams. It's not true, anyone can fall victim! Anyone! Jack Daniels, neat! What do you want? I'll have what you're having. Two, eh? Whassup! You like what you see? You come here a lot? No, my life is not that interesting. It's more interesting than mine. There's nothing for me to do here. What do you normally do for fun? Watch movies, go skating, just kick it with friends, you know? You can do that here. So, if you needed money badly... would your mom send it? How much do you need? $5,000. My mom would never send me that much money. It's okay. If you need money, I can help you scam. I'm going to bring you water, if you continue talking rubbish. I know things about America that could help you... and all I want in return is a plane ticket home. You keep the rest. Your mother brought you here with her own money. If you return, she will not welcome you! I'm not staying with my mom, I'm staying at my dad's. They're divorced? Separated. You should confirm with your father first. I did! He knows, I talked to him. I did! He's okay with it! So, what do you think? I'll think about it. What time is it? It's 6:00 o'clock. Why are you all dressed up? I'm going out. I'll be back in a few hours, okay? There is food... somewhere. I said look the part! You're supposed to be a chemist, not a village chief! I want to impress him now. How much is here? I thought I had more. You see why I don't like to work with you? You promised me 10,000! Don't worry, it's enough! What do you have for me? Everything is in there. He pays the money, and you can fit all these chemicals... inside this canvas bag. What will I use for the test? You don't know me, I've done this before. Hi. I thought it was just going to be me and you. It's okay, he's a friend, his name is Victor. You don't have any lady friends? Come on, come on. So, can I put this here? Yeah, sure, wherever you want. How much is in here? Three million. U.S. dollars? Of course. So you're telling me, there are 30,000 $100 dollar bills here? Correct! It doesn't look like 30,000. Well, looks can be deceiving. So how do I get this shit off? That's why Victor is here. Let's go. Can I please have a spoon and bowl? Ah, here's a spoon. Is this okay? Mm-hm. The spoon, you need anything else? No. Are the chemicals toxic? No, but it can stain your fingers. That's Tebi-Manetic, it's a solvent. It is used to dissolve the black coating. What's that? Humine Powder. It serves as a catalyst. What's a catalyst? A catalyst helps to increase the rate of reaction. Jesus! How many chemicals do I need? SSD Super Solution is the third and final one. Next to Tebi-Manetic, it will remove the black dye completely. And do I need one of those syringes? No. Hah-hah, Ben Franklin, hello. Are you fucking kidding me? Let me see that. There he is. I'm speechless. So how much of this stuff do I need? 20 kilograms of humine powder... and about 12 liters of each of the solution. And how much is that gonna cost me? $7,000. $5,000. Which is it, 7,000 or 5,000? $5,000. $7,000. Which is it? $5,000. All right, oh, no, no, no! Uh, don't touch that, I've got a cold. And, uh, just not help... Just put it down, there's toilet paper in the... Bathroom or toilet paper, just use that, okay? Yeah, sorry. In Nigeria, napkins are called serviettes, serviette. Serviette? So, how long is it gonna take me to do all the cleaning? One week, tops. And you'll show me how to do all the chemicals again? Of course, my friend, by the time we leave you today... you will be an expert at cleaning black money. Where are the chemicals? Victor! Victor! Victor! It's okay, we're okay, I got time. Heads up, everyone, suspect is heading downstairs. Uche, follow him! Uche! Take off your jacket! You have reached... the voice mailbox of... Kingsley Okocha. Please record your voice message. Dad, give me a call back when you get this message. Look, I'm serious, it's an emergency. You can reach me at this number. Eze, Bimbo told me that you ran off with Pius... so I know you are in there, open up! I have not told your mother, so there is still time... for you to stop this foolishness. Eze... as God is my witness, this thing you are doing... you will not succeed, do you hear me? I promise you! State your name for the camera. Babatunde Oguntade. State your name! Pius. Pius what? Nwosu. I am Nifemi Olufayo... agent for the Economic Financial Crimes Commissions... and that is U.S. Secret Service Agent Dennis Blake. Now the Secret Service is here because they investigate... U.S. financial crimes. Now before we start, I am required to inform you that... you are under no obligations to answer my questions. Anything you say or do will be used as evidence against you. Understand? What is this? Black money, correct? According to you two, underneath this black coating... is a $100 dollar bill and it was your intention to convince... Agent Dennis to purchase a set of expensive chemicals. Except this thing you call "black money"... is actually only construction paper... and those "expensive chemicals"... are just cheap household products! Now do you know the penalty for obtaining funds... under false pretense? Up to seven years in prison. Now I know you both don't want that, do you? We are recording! Madam, it's an emergency. Wha... What are you doing? I've been asked to release them. What's going on? You are free to go. Me? What happened this afternoon? It was a mistake, sir. No, it was more than a mistake! Do you know how much I had to pay... for them to set the two of you free? I take 20 percent from your scams, correct? Correct, sir. Starting today, I want 40 percent. Are you hearing me? Yes, sir. See, this is why people like you have to pay people like me. I am your insurance policy. So, where is my money? I have two million so far. Two million? Only half?! I gave you a second chance, don't make me take it away. Four million by noon tomorrow. No excuses! Go. Wait! One more thing. Who is Eze? He is my cousin. Are you trying to scam him? No, sir! A woman came by the station and filed a report that you... were trying to scam him. That is not true, sir! The boy is American, correct? Yes, sir. Please, sir! I didn't... agh! Enough! Return that boy to that woman, you hear me? Take him! Can you drive? Yeah. Come with me. What are we doing here? Ssh! Stop fooling! You still haven't told me why we're here? You see that silver car? See the black car in front of it? This is the key to that car. I need you to drive it and follow me. Whose car is that? My friend's... you said you wanted to help me. This is your chance. Yeah, I wanted to help you scam, not steal cars. We are not stealing cars, that's my friend's car. We're bringing it to him. Then why are you hiding? If you don't want to help, I can take you back to my mother. Someone is approaching your area. The young man? Yes, where is he heading? The black Toyota. That's where you arrested Pius correct? Standby. Hey! Hey! Shit. Where are the chemicals? The what? Where are the chemicals? Sir, I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. Oh... sorry. It's not the car, he's American. What is this, man? Just get the rest! Pius! Wait here... keys! Don't worry, they won't find anything. I hope you were not followed. No. Here. You dumped everything? Uh-huh. Good! Yes. He is family. You haven't answered my question. What are we doing next? Nothing is next, I'm done. Until when? I am done! Completely? Yes. You're being paranoid! This is just a one-time thing. They will leave you alone... as soon as the investigation is over. What of Smart? Will Smart leave me alone? Do not worry about Smart. I can help you pay your 40 percent. Everyday is for the thief, one day is for the owner. Do you know what that means? It means, you should stop while you still have your head! I can hide from the EFCC and the Secret Service... but I cannot hide from Smart. There is no where in Lagos that man cannot find me. Then leave Lagos! Leave Lagos and go where? Lagos is my home, no, I have to find this man that money. There is no way around it. Give yourself a brain. Smart does not give second chances! He will kill you, whether you find the money or not! Why would he do that? To send a message to others who may be as foolish as you are! If he wanted to kill me, I would be dead already. I have warned you. My hands are clean. Look, we do not have to agree! Just help me, please! Baba, I am begging you. I am done. Should I be worried? I told you, I owe someone. It does not concern you. Who was that guy at the house? His name is Baba. He was the one who taught me scamming. So, why'd we leave his car? There was evidence in the trunk, you saw it. So, that's why you needed me to drive... so I'd get caught with the evidence and not you. Do you still want to help me scam? What do you need me to do? Who do you know with money? Nobody. You do, just think. I don't know any rich people. They don't need to be rich, they just cannot be poor. What about you? Who do you know with money? I've scammed all the people I know. Some of them, even twice. Why don't we just do another email scam? That one is a long con. We need something short and sweet. You don't have to be involved in the scam, if that's your worry. I will handle it. All I need from you is a person, that's it! What are you gonna do to him? I don't know yet. It depends on the circumstance. Are you going to hurt him? No! God forbid! Your father, he's expecting your return. How long will that offer last? He is expecting you, right? Yes! Then what is holding you? Does this man mean more to you than going home? Eze, look at me! Does this man mean more to you than going back home? Just be honest with yourself. No. Then who is this person? You said all you needed was a name. He doesn't know me, he knows you. What am I gonna say? Tell him to meet you at 68 Rumokoro tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.! Why is he meeting me? Make something up! Like what? I don't know him, you know him! You know what will make him come. Hey... it's Eze. Is this the right address? Yeah, this is the address. Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm looking for Eazy. Do you know where he is? You mean Eze? Yeah. He's coming, take a seat. Where is he? He's on his way, please, take a seat. Okay. He called me yesterday and said he needed my help. Apparently, someone took his money... again! Is he okay? Yes, he's okay. Yeah, but was he robbed? Did he get physically hurt? Do not worry, when he comes, he will tell you himself. How do you know Eze? We are friends. What's your name? Victor. I'm Wallace. Dad? Eze, good morning. What took so long to call me back? I've been busy. I said it was an emergency. How was school? Mom told you? Yes, last night. Did she tell you, she lied to me? She told me everything. Did you agree with her? Your mother wants what's best for you. What about what I want? Eze, do this for her, please! Dad, I'm buying a plane ticket home tonight. Where are you getting the money? Pius. Who? Grace's son. Does your mother know? No. She's going to kill you. Dad, can I stay with you? No! Where else am I going to stay? You can stay right where you are! Dad, I never asked you for anything. Can you please just do this one thing for me? No! You're not bringing me into this! You're already in it! I said, no! Eze, I'm serious! I know you want to come home and I don't blame you... but you can't always get what you want. That's just life. Yeah, I'm sorry, Eze, I have a customer. I'll talk to you later. Dad! Bye. Dad! Fuck! Hello? Oh, you're outside, okay, I'll tell him. Eze is outside. Is he?! Yes, he's outside the gate and please, bring him this? What's this? Supplies... it's from his mother. Okay, thank you. Get down! Down! Don't move! Lie down! Down! Don't move! Where's your partner? I don't know what you're talking about! Keep moving, keep moving! You, get up! Why am I here? Get up now! Let's go. Enter. Remove his handcuffs now! He's a civilized man. You can sit down. Does this look familiar? I wonder what is inside. Do you know what this is? They are chemicals for a black money scam. Remember that man you saw this morning? He is under investigation by the EFCC... and the U.S. Secret Service for selling chemicals. Just like these ones. Given your affiliation with Pius and this evidence... a lawyer will inform you that after a preliminary hearing... your case will go to court. And since you are a flight risk... we will have to detain you until then. Also, the lawyer will inform you how long... it takes to process the paperworks. Though, I hear that you practice accounting in Lagos... so you may be fairly familiar with that already. How much do you want? This time, I've helped you. Next time, I will not be so generous! I understand. Have you returned the American boy? I will return him tonight, sir! Do not scam him! I mean it! Okay. Sir?! Yes? Where is Ikenna? I don't know anyone called Ikenna. The young boy in your office. I don't know who you are talking about. There was no one in my office. Do you understand? Femi! How are you? Everything is fine, I have a plan. Get your things! We are going to the airport now! Is Wallace okay? Yes, he is fine! Grab your bag! Did you scam him? Yes! What happened? Are you ready to go? Tell me what happened! It's complicated! What do you mean, it's complicated? It's okay! I have an arrangement with a friend at the airport. I called him just now. What's going on? It's fine, my friend is a flight attendant. If there are any remaining seats going to America... he will give them to us, under the table. I can't just get on a random flight! Eze, you cannot stay with me any longer! It is not safe! If you want to go back home, it's now or never. Hello. Yes, he's with me. That's fine, okay. Okay, we are walking there now. See you soon. That's my friend. He says he has a flight to Atlanta leaving in two hours. Is that okay? Is there anyone you regret scamming? You did what you had to do! I don't have anywhere to stay when I get back. What do you mean?! My dad... he said I can't stay with him. So, you lied to me? I just wanted to go home. Do you still want to go? I don't know. What is it? I told you, he's here! Yes, he's sitting next to me! Yes, he has everything, just wait! Don't worry, everything will be fine. Let's go. Trust me. Sorry. Where are you? Okay! Passport! Eze! Stay here! I want to go! No, no! He can't see you, you can't see him, just stay, stay! You're by the entrance? I don't see you. Okay, I see you. Where is he? What? Safe trip! Bye! Next, please! Safe trip! Next, please!
