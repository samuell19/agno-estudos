Quiet down, boy. I said... That kind still won't sleep? I'm gonna show you what happens when you boys don't keep quiet. Get back in your rooms, now! I told you to get to sleep. I don't care if you can't. The hell? I'll make you sleep, boy. Leave him alone! Cody? That is not my name. No don't. To the purely physiological, like apnea and narcolepsy, or Kleine Levins. Kleine Levin mainly affects teenage boys. Anyone know the symptoms? Are you even listening? Your foster uncle's elaborating on peculiar brain function during Kleine Levin syndrome. Yeah, child's play. You didn't sleep again last night? Karla, it's not good for you. You have late nights, too. Yeah, but look at what I've been reading. There is a Javanese demon, which if you give it your soul will make you rich overnight, but will turn you into a wild boar. What? Really? People in Indonesia have seen these things, there have been documented reports. There are some sleeping disorders that are so rare they only occur in a handful of the world's population. Fatal Familial Insomnia, FFI affects 40 families, worldwide. Put simply, FFI prevents you from sleeping, until you die. It's genetic, but random. As the condition progresses, the patient is unable to reach any REM sleep. In its final stages, the brain atrophies. The patient becomes catatonic, then organ failure, and then death. There are cases where chronic insomniacs, like an FFI patient, can become extremely unstable, dangerous even. Take this man, for example. Now he went without sleep for about 30 days. He was extremely paranoid, delusional. Finally, his wife and child were found dead, murdered. Some people want to link satanism to this guy, claim it's evidence of demonic possession, but not me. We stick to medicine in this class. And that's it for today, you've been great. There might be a quiz next week on FFI, - Kleine Levin. - Catch up with you later. And their associated physiological effects. I'm sorry, all we can do now is make your brother comfortable. No, I can't accept that. There's still plenty of options. You can see, he's steadily declining. His energy levels are constantly fluctuating, Miss Dawson. Without sleep for this long it's just... Look, in 2008, Mexican doctors ran a drug trial that directly provoked the lapsed prion 23 in the brain to start rebuilding proper sleep chemistry. The patient actually slept for a whole hour. Now, I know it's not legal here, but we need to start... But what happened after that? Did the patient recover? You're still only a student, Karla. You need to trust our experience. Since your parents died, especially the way they did, Blake's never had a normal life. We always knew this day would come. We can't do anything more for Blake here. It's better he's at home in these final stages, anyway. I'm sorry. If you send him home, he doesn't have a chance. It can help to talk to someone. I could ask the chaplain to come down, he is a good man. Faith isn't gonna help my brother. Excuse me. Hey, KJ. Hey. They are pulling me out, aren't they? I just need a good night's rest, that's all. I've gotta practise counting sheep. Hey Blake. Hey Pat. Hey. Hi. Blake, I have things to do, so I will see you later. So, how's today? Yeah, fine. Just I don't think we're gonna be smoking buddies again any time soon. It's too late, I've quit. Yeah, right. Oh yeah, and it's working. As long as you keep munching, yeah. Okay. All right, deal up, let's go. - Seven. - Let's do it, all right. To give Blake the treatment he needs, we have to take him somewhere we can't be observed. No, it's too dangerous, we need to petition the hospital. Blake doesn't have time for that. What if he has a seizure, and we don't have the right staff? Or the right drugs? I've never even seen this place. It's been used for this kind of treatment before. Remember when I told you that your dad took your mom to a special facility. Yeah. Yeah, well I haven't been completely honest with you. It's an abandoned basement here on this campus. What? It was the only way we could conceal those kind of drug trials. I have two patients down there right now, who I'm treating. For those two people, just like Blake, it's this, or death. Without proper care, Blake won't last the week. Wouldn't you do anything you can to save him? I just heard. Rob's right. You know if we can't work inside the system then we're gonna have to get outside of it. He didn't exactly invite you. You're gonna need my help, Karla. And if Rob's got an issue with me, then he's just gonna have to live with it. You can do this. It's gonna work. I'm just gonna grab his chart. Yeah. I don't know, she's come around. As you leave every morning. I think visiting hours are over. Who were you talking to? What? I've got it. Let's go. Hey B. Hey. You ready? You need a pharmacologist. Why you? Because you can trust me. Can we? Pat stays. All right then, everybody ready? Hop in. Watch your step. How'd you find this place? One night we were students, blind drunk, me and your dad stumbled on the elevator, keys inside. Years later, we remembered, and so we came down here to treat your mom. No one knows about it. Everyone's forgotten it even exists. So, this is your new workspace. Who are they? That's Chris, he has near-fatal sleep apnea. And Angela, violent night-terrors. They came to me in the hospital, and asked for help. I'm doing what I can. We have everything down here, a full lab, medications I've stashed over the years, and ironically, sleeping quarters. Karla, now's our chance to make things right. Why the lock? Sleep disorders can be unpredictable. It's just a precaution. Hi guys. I'll be coming and going to keep up appearances. Now get to work. We'll see you soon. Good luck, Blake. Are you okay with this, B? I'm good. A splash of paint. Wide-screen TV. Could be real nice. Well, I'm never too far away, okay? Okay. Here. You ever played this game? So, what's with you and Patrick? What do you mean? Oh come on. We used to date, a while ago. It doesn't matter now. Wait a minute, you and jockstrap used to date, and I'm only finding out about this now? I think we have more important things to be thinking about. Fine. Fine. Okay, so remember how we had segments, so this is where this comes in. This is the longest road, so it's worth two victory points, and this card goes to the player with the longest road of at least five segments, okay. So another player who builds a longer road, they can take this card off you, all right? Still following? So, we know that barbiturates are having zero effect, but have you heard about this doxycycline trial? Yeah, I'll tell you about it tomorrow. I'm gonna call it a night, and you should too. You need sleep. Yeah, no, I will. I'm just gonna work a little bit longer. Fine. If you want to sleep, you should sleep. No, I'll just stay up all night then. Hey. What? Hey, just help me a sec. What's going on? I think there might be something behind this. What, like a secret door? Yeah, maybe. Actually? Can you just help me? It's someone's journal. Priest, Father Francis Sangermano, Sangermano. Creepy. What the hell? Look. What? Dad. I don't believe it. This is Doctor William Dawson. After exhausting other options, we've come here to try out experimental drugs on patients with potentially fatal sleep disorders, including my wife, Sarah. I know I'm this close to the solution. I know it. Is it off? Filming? Yeah, ready. Okay good. So day five, hopefully one of the drugs will help them return to normal sleep and normal life. Any change? Oh, sorry, still not used to it. So, anything? No, nothing. Perhaps we should take this opportunity... This is the devil's work. Francis, you're here. Francis, this is my good friend, Doctor Rob Atwood. Right, Sarah talks about you all the time. How is she? She's okay, no sleep yet, but she seems to be improving. You look tired, William. You should get some rest. And Father Sangermano, what does a man of faith think about what Doctor Dawson is trying to achieve here with science? What is this, "60 Minutes"? It could if we cure them. It's a misconception that the church is against medical science. Anything to help soothe the troubled soul, provided it's not hurting anyone, is a good thing. I'm just gonna say hi to Sarah. Okay. So, a priest? Yeah I know, he's an old friend. He's the one that married us. Besides, Sarah wants him here. Yeah, but... Sorry to interrupt. William I... Francis, what is it? Sarah, she, she said something. What? She wouldn't have, she can't have. It wasn't just that. It was her voice. It was as if someone else was speaking. I'm, I don't get it, who? I need to go, and talk to a friend of mine. I'll be back soon. Francis? Why hide these? I don't know. We have to tell Rob. Maybe, maybe we shouldn't. What? Why wouldn't we tell him? The information in here could help fast-track Blake's treatment. We could find out more about my parents. Yeah but, why didn't he mention this to you? Well, how could he know they were hidden? Yeah, but he knew that they were made, he's in them. I mean, don't you think that's a little strange that he didn't tell you that there was a record of your parents' final days? Look, let's just watch them first, and get a bit more information, then we tell him. Where's the harm in that? Okay. Let's watch the next one then. What are you doing? Working. What are you doing? Karla, you're tired. Let me take your shift. No thanks. Hey. Blake. Blake? Blake? Blake? Hey KJ. Hey. You were, what were you doing? I don't know. Well you couldn't move at all yesterday so, you must be feeling better. Yeah. Feeling much better now. Thank you. Hey. So, how did Blake respond to the new combination? Yeah, he seems to be doing better. He's got a lot more mobility. Still no REM sleep though. Is there something that you needed, Patrick? Yeah actually, I wanted to talk. Well, there's nothing to say. Come on, we could at least clear the air. It's not logical to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result. Relationships aren't about logic, Karla, they're about the way we feel. Fine, I feel like as soon as things got hard with Blake, you just walked out on me. I never walked out on Blake. No, you walked out on me, Patrick, you just left. What? I'm sorry. Yeah well, what good does that do me now? How are you doing? Who keeps moving this? It's evil. Angela, did you say something? Okay, so William you have to end this. What? It's gone too far. William, what is he actually doing here? Sarah asked for me to be here. Open your eyes. You don't have to be religious to know that what's going on in that room isn't natural. Nothing here is natural, that's what we're trying to fix. We're trying to get her and the others back to a normal life. I'm trying to save them. Something is wrong with Sarah, something more than that disease. She won't talk to me. When she looks at me, it terrifies me. Well maybe that's because every time you come here, you terrify her, and the rest of with your crazy talk. I spent some time with this, William. I've spoken to my Cardinal. I believe that Sarah may be possessed. Jesus Christ. Francis, listen to yourself, that's ridiculous. What the hell? It's here. William you have to listen to me. You did just... Yeah. I sure did. Okay, day eight. We've been progressing... He's here, he's inside the room! Okay, they're now displaying extreme paranoia, except for Sarah, who is quite different. We're gonna need to try some stronger sedation. It'll be okay. We'll go in there together. Shit, his shots. No, look. My God! Blake. Don't watch any more without me. Hey KJ. How are you feeling? Better, good. You feel like maybe, you want to get some sleep? Maybe. Still counting sheep. Are you okay? He's trying to get me. Who is? Blake, he keeps on whispering to someone, but nobody's there. You have to get me out of here. It's okay. I can't stay here. We're gonna make you better. We're gonna make you all better. Shhh. Did you see that? What? Angela, she grabbed me. She was saying stuff about Blake. Huh? Angela, she grabbed me, just now. Karla, I was watching you the whole time, I didn't see any of that. Look, if you're worried about Angela, she'll be fine once the sedatives set in. Until Rob gets back, I'm keeping a close eye on her. You need to get some rest. No, no I'm gonna, I'm gonna stay up, and keep watch. You know, make sure they're all okay. Hey Pat? No, nothing. Never mind. Please, please. Just leave me alone. Let me out! Let me out! Angela don't. A present for you, KJ. No! You okay? Blake's looking at me, almost like he was pleased. I think he told her to do it. Hon, she was really sick. - I don't think... - I know what I saw. I believe you, Karla. Well whatever happened, this can't continue. But Blake... I had to contact Angela's family. We can't lie them about what happened, where it happened. This is on me. You guys weren't here, I'll take full responsibility. But what about Blake? We have to take Angela home. After that we'll find someplace else to treat Blake. I'm sorry. Wait a second, where is Patrick? I went and told him what happened. I knew he'd take off at the first sign of trouble. He's unbelievable. I'll stay with Blake and Chris, you take Angela upstairs. Go, I'll watch them. It's stuck, it won't turn. What? It won't budge. No, the button doesn't work unless it's unlocked. Here, let me try it. See, it's not gonna work. Okay, stairs. Is there another stairwell? No. Of course. Awesome. What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here? There's a phone. I'll contact the hospital about getting us out. Yes, I know. I know. Thank you. Well? Maintenance said they'll be down here some time tomorrow, could be the morning. Don't they know we're stuck down here? We have until morning? Yeah. We shouldn't waste that time. Karla's right, we should do what we can. Stay focused on what you came down here to do, and we'll be out of here before you know it. Patrick, could you help me with the body? Hey? Hey. How are you feeling? Me? I'm fine. Angie, she... What happened? I can only remember... She, I guess her condition got the better of her. I guess she's in a better place now. Do you remember when Rob got us those rabbits? Millie and Anna Claire. Millie died. Yeah. And I was so worried about what happened, you know? Where she went. And you just said, "It's okay KJ, she's in heaven." You just believed it. Like you knew it was true. I mean you could just do that, just believe. I didn't trust God. I didn't feel safe with the idea. And then I couldn't understand Him. You got sick and, I started to hate Him, like really hate Him. And I want to believe like you, I do. But I can't. Now I deal like this. KJ? I'm gonna kill you, just like I did your cunt mother. Hey. I spoke to Alice. She told me that you, are you okay? I meant what I said. Blake. He can't have. You imagined it. You're exhausted. I didn't imagine it. Can you just believe me? There's something going on here. Something bad. Like what? I want to show you something but, I'm worried you're gonna run away again. Karla, it was a mistake. You just abandoned me, Pat. You were so focused on curing Blake, I couldn't see that that was more important than me, than us. I never should have left. Hey, there is nowhere else I want to be. I'm so sorry. This is Martin, he has cataplexy, which commenced at around age six. Five. I'm sorry, five. How are you feeling? What's that, can you speak up for the camera? Stop yelling at me. Stop yelling at me. It's your voice. His voice. Whose voice is inside your head? This is Ursula. Kleine Levin syndrome. Potentially life-threatening she... What is it Ursula? Sarah, Fatal Familial Insomnia. I'm here baby, talk to me. How are you feeling? Here sometimes. Gone sometimes. Gone, where do you go? With him. Who? Between awake and asleep. That's where he is. Trying to get in. Who is he? Iddimu. Who's Iddimu? You've improved so much, it'll only be a little longer, Sarah. Why do you keep calling me Sarah? When's the last time you slept, doctor? Jesus! She shouldn't be able to see us, right? I'm getting Francis. No, William. William? You gotta see this. No no William, I'm sure this can be explained. Oh my God. Let me out! It was here a minute ago, Sarah, she was staring straight at us. Those are Bible pages. Mother of God. You have to end this, now! William. Sarah, say something, let me know you're all right. We have to go in there. She just has to sleep. She no longer needs to sleep. Hey. What is it, Alice? You both have to see this. This had better be good. Okay okay look, Iddimu. The one who takes us from the nocturnal refuge, the parasite that will destroy all things. It says here, that when a demon ruled, there was a land without sleep. But God overpowered him and created sleep to protect us from his influence. So if you stay awake too long, the demon will get in. It must have been what happened to your mom. What? Don't try and tell me that what was on those tapes was purely medical. Sangermano researched this, and he put everything right here. I think you're right, Karla, there is something happening here. Yeah, there are sick people who need our help. It's not Blake's sickness that's causing him to be like this. Listen, once the demon has awoken, he will feed on the souls of innocents. When they hear his seductive whisper, they will give their souls to the void and increase his power. Once the demon has consumed what he needs, he can be set free. What does that mean? No need for a human host anymore. So, how do we help Blake, how do we stop this? An exorcism. I've heard enough. You don't believe this, do you? The medications aren't working. An exorcism is the only way. The incantations are right here. Come on. Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it's not happening. It's our only choice. So, you want to give Blake an exorcism? You have to have faith. Blake doesn't have time for this. We need to keep treating him with real medicine. This is occult bullshit. She's letting her witchcraft fantasies threaten Blake's life. Hey, I'm right here, you know. You're letting your stupid little witchcraft shit threaten Blake's life. I love Blake just as much as you do. I would never endanger his life on a whim, you asshole. Alice? Look, I know that this sounds crazy, but I've seen things that I can't explain. How can you think something like this is even possible? Because I know Blake, and I knew my mom. You know, those tapes don't make any sense. Yeah, I know. You know, I mean things were getting hectic, they were about to go inside that room. Yeah? Why would you not film that? Well, we've watched everything in the box. There are no more tapes. Maybe one got lost or damaged. Maybe? Unless things got crazy and whoever hid them didn't have time to. What? The camera. We didn't check to see if there's a tape still left inside. Bygone era. Whoever finds this, please, please give this to my kids. They deserve to know what happened and what I've done. Karla, Blake, I swear, I brought her here to save her. I'm sorry. Goodbye. Turn that thing off, now. Faith is our only weapon. Make sure you follow my lead, understood? This is madness. I won't ask again. Of course, Father. William? William? Sarah. You're not welcome here, priest. I'll take this whore with me if you come one step closer. Sarah, please. William's dead. We're all dead. I know, we've got to get out of here. Weaver can use this. We've got to keep this as a record, too. Give it to me. Give it to me. You're a priest. You've ruined everything. I don't know who might find these tapes, but Robert, Doctor Robert Atwood is responsible for the deaths. We have to warn Alice. Alice? Alice? No. Do you believe now, KJ? No! Oh come on. There's no dial tone. Fuck! Patrick, calm down. Stop okay, please? We have to go, right now. I'm not leaving without Blake. No Karla, we have to go. Don't you get it, we've gotta get out of here. Patrick, calm down okay, and listen to me. Sangermano wrote the whole thing down. I know what to do. Nothing can stop this, we have to go right now. I'm not going anywhere without my brother. I'm staying. Look at me, look at me, look at me. Patrick. I need you. Okay? It's gonna be okay. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. The door. Patrick. Pat? Christopher. Hey, Chris. Chris, you okay? His eyes. How could he do this? Let's get Blake. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I don't know what I saw to read. You'd better figure it out. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He leads me by the still waters, he restores my soul. Yay, though I walk the valley of the shadow of death. It's not working. I shall fear no evil. Iddimu, you are revealed. I beg you through the intercession and help of the Archangels Michael. Robert. Stay out of this. Give me that book. Give it to me. Keep reading. I beg through the intercession and help of the Archangel Michael, Rafael, and Gabriel. Of the evil one. Patrick! You're insane. Hey Rob. You're okay, you're okay. You're okay. Nope. Patrick? Patrick. Patrick. Patrick! Patrick! Why didn't you just kill me? The more a demon consumes, the stronger he becomes. I needed as many of you as possible. So is this what your life amounts to? Is killing people who trusted you? You were like a father to me. You're a coward. What do you know of courage? Nothing. I was trapped, tormented every day, and he saved me. He took away the monster that made my life hell, who made me want to end it every single day. There was another boy, Cody. Iddimu possessed him, and I saw a power I never knew could exist. And in an instant everything changed. But Cody took back control and stopped him from getting in, the only way he could. I can't let him back in. No! Iddimu gave me my freedom, and I owe him the same. I researched him for years. I tried to get him to wake in me, but he never took over. I only felt his presence lingering at the edge of consciousness. When you stay awake too long, hear things you shouldn't, and see things that aren't there, that's him, trying to get in. To help Iddimu I needed a host. I reconnected with William once I heard about your mother, an FFI sufferer, the perfect candidate. I suggested the trials, reminded William of this place, and we began. But then, the priest arrived. Whatever he did to Sarah, after she killed your father, she killed herself. Once again, Iddimu was denied freedom. After I recite this incantation, Iddimu will be free again. Robert? You can finally sleep now, hon. My lord, Iddimu, scourge of the nocturnal refuge, ruler of the ever-waking fire, come forth. Spirits whose die king, amen. In the name of the Lord, amen, he be gone from the body of this man, so he may rest... Blake it's me. It's KJ. Your brother is gone. I beg you Lord, through the intercession and help of the Archangels Michael, Rafael, and Gabriel, to deliver thou brother who is enslaved by the evil one. My lord Iddimu, come forth and break the bonds of your human prison. Nothing controls me. No. No. My lord, I can set you free. Blake, stop. Don't let him win, okay? I need you to help me beat him. I need you to try. I need you to fight. Blake! Blake? Hey, hey. KJ. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's over now. It's over now.
