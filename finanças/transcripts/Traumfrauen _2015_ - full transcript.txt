DREAM WOMEN Tadaa! It looks awesome. - Don't I look like a Christmas tree? - Crap. Pure silk and down set. You take that. You said I could decide against it. - I want shoes. - They are reduced. You pay only half. You save 100 Euro. The dress costs 110. - So you spend only 10 Euro. - Aua. - Hier... Hot. And therein you meet today the advocate. He understands that with the sleeve? He thinks I'm not dressed properly. Half dressed ist that men find good. - I'm so fat. - Nop! I have often to make love with him, before he realizes that I'm ugly. - You're beautiful. - You want to please me. I have so much hair as you have eyelashes. I weighs 1,000 kilo. Mhm, sure. My sweet, I find it so complete. We pull together. I'm so happy. You... Your apartment... You have it terminated already? I might not inspire confidence as owner of the most horrific ongoing caf? of Berlin. But I got it. And have you already sent the notice to the renter? No, I have pre-punched him. The next tenant draws tomorrow. Soon we'll wake up together every morning. Great, isn't it? Well, it's a beautiful idea. I have already practiced everyday stress: "Bring kindly out the garbage." "Suck the dust out or will tell the mites that they have to pay rent." That joke with the mite is good. Monika? Monika with you, from the accounting? Ups. Oh... - Are you crazy? - I just wanted to get coffee to me. This is the camera, you are here. This is a line! I have no idea of technology. - Hello? You wanted to tell her anyway. Since three months ago! Did you want to wait until she join her stuff here with us? How? Who lives there? She is neurotic. You have to talk to her as with a moron. - I'm neurotic? - Then tell her when the baby arrives. - Baby? - I do that at its own pace. I wanted to be delicate and considerate. You're such a coward. You're not so selfless as I always thought. Moni... - Hello? - Hallo! I end this now! It's over, okay? Thank you that you have taken me. Neighbors are to help, Margaux. - Norbert makes you tomorrow the rosary. - Tranks. I do appreciate your help. Carl always has done that. Now he's gone. Yes. We saw him with his new one other day playing tennis. - She's not even 40 years old. - She'll take care of him later. Norbert, hear briefly. He has dragged the square dance and now he goes to a young phisiotherapist. I also got myself a prescription. I don't let him alone. Otherwise happens to me the same as to you. These young ones, they do things in bed, you do not believe. The men fall by them easily. They suck the guys. And we had previously only home economics classes. As if we would bake a man to orgasm. Papi? Hello? Hey. - Back from the Maldives? - It was hot and expensive. I'm here with Mr. Nuesslein about my insurance. There are legislative changes next year. Philipp and you fought or broken commitment? - I broke up with Philipp. - Oh! - He is such an ass. - I'm sorry. - Do you want to talk about it? - Yes. Carl, I won't do everyday chakra-balancing with you, if you don't use the ball. Earlier i thought: "Where is the new, beautiful ball?" - Papi? - Yes, little Leni, I'm here again. Little Leni... You know, it'll get better. You're young. Well, you're already more than 30. For us, at time, that was ancient. I have lovesickness and you tell me I'm old? Yes, ancient. You were, at that time, very old for us. The connection is very bad. Hello? Leni? Ah, Miss Reimann: Stop. What is that? I bought shoes and then I omitted the food. Please send it down first. We talked already about food intake in the corridor. So and what ist it now? - The toilet paper? - Yes, this is company property. Oh. It's late. The stores are closed and I use napkins for a week... And again too many details, Miss Reimann. Too many details! - Sorry. - Theft of firm toilet paper I can not accept. - Renewed warning. - No, Mr. Dr. Hengesbach. I give you the role gack or I pay it for you. A moment. Not only you keep an offense for meaningless, now you want to corrupt me? Uau! You're putting words in my mouth. Then keep eyes on choosing a career, Mrs. Lawier. Hm, yes. Ah, Miss Reimann: Please stop trying to make fear to iMelody clients because of these poor Internet. You sound like a crazy fortune teller. Mm. Asshole. Hey. 20, 30, 40, 41... Mist. Unfortunately I have only 42,41 Euro. Today is the worst day of my life. But it costs 42,50 Euro. Can we round the 9 cents, perhaps? Or I... I give you a chewing gum? Stefanie, in such a case we tell the customer, gently but firmly, that we cannot do it. No, that can't be. Then I take that away. Something that isn't so necessary. No idea. The customer can consult the Fun-and-Service-Counter. - Fun and what? - Is that right now? Yes. The problem has been solved by itself. Always amazing. Thank you very much. - With pleasure. Have you not this Caf? across from the park? - I have recently ordered a Cappuccino. - Cappuccino? That was a joke. I know you don't remember every cappuccino. Hi, I'm Joseph. - Leni. You, That is so very nice of you. I'll give it back to you, ok? All right. - It's everything alright? - I got a super cold. Please, could we have your identity card number for our customer file? - Thanks, no. - Because you're missing something. From 250 euros there's a gift to, for example... a ball. No. Ey, Were you not in the Christmas series - of "Tommy, who sells his laughter"? - No. - But he is that. - Let's take a picture. That you shop here. You bring really shine to our cabin. - So, how much is it? - 5,99. Wait, I make it for you. May I help you? These celebrities are all somehow... assholes. Speaking of baking, I have a lot of cake from the granson's birthday. Now you're doing a course, yes? There are only abandoned wives, that men are looking for. But now I am a deserted wife, Gundula. Yeah, but I wouldn't ever say it so clearly. That sound so negative... so "leave" to. Then how to say that? Say something like... "My husband is gone from me" No one asks after that. They think he's dead and want to meet you. Now don't look so sad. I would also prefer David Garrtt or Schweighofer at home. Norbert has become very lazy. He always want to lie down and sleep. But with the grandchildren he can bounce. I have a lot to do. Trank you again. Ah, eat only a bit of the cake, ok? - To become very thin. - Bye. Suddenly there's nowhere left to go Like a dog in the streets I'm wandering around Welcome to the Osteoporosis Clinic. Even if it cracks and crunches, we remain cheerful. Reimann, hello? My name is Merlin, I'm tarot cards casual. Ask yourself what the future holds? You're lucky, for me it's just low prices. - Ahn, and why? - I am in training. Oh. Und is the whole anonymous? Sure. Or do you think my name is really Merlin? Well, I would be interested: When is my lovesick over? It's really bad. Alright, we look after. The good old lovesickness. It isn't getting any better. My daughters are completely different. They are much freer. They do exactly what they want. The youngest is totally family-oriented... Hi! Have you been waiting for me? Hey, sweety. What are you doing here? - We had an appointment? - Again? Well, we had no time identified. That just doesn't fit to me. I wanted to test the new all bearings. I could blow you one. Okay. Can you take off the high heels? - The ground carries bugs. - Sorry. How was it with bullets to the ears? You look like a Christmas tree. Well, come. The future says: The man who has broken my heart is too the man in whom I fall in love? That... That's then Carl. My... my ex husband. Wait, I'll check it again. Well: Your next great love has to do with your broken heart. Great. This ex is sitting now with a physiotherapist in a bungalow in the Maldives... ...and hear Rihanna. You have to go out and increase your hit rate. - It is zero. - And what do I do with the results? I don't even know if I have a personality. I've ever only done what my husband wanted. He wanted to play tennis and golf. Now I have two complete sets of equipment and tennis and golf enthusiasts. But what can I talk with a stranger? Tell him what you saw on TV. If he finds you hot, that doesn't matter. - I find no one hot. - Your voice is very hot. If you are as you sound, I see no problems. My voice? Mhm... I want that you now stuck deep in your ass and, on my command, come so hard as never before in your live. What is that? You brought me out. I had a little nausea. Sorry. Phew. Now I'm completely not in the mood. We can work off. Today the younger women can do it all. - How to work off? - With a banana or something? But when do you really need to break? Jesus, you're really such a small jerk. Miss Reimann? Miss Reimann? Miss Reimann, how many fingers do you see? How many fingers do you see? One. I see one finger. Oh, my god, she had brain damage. Oh, darling, it will be all right, you'll get well again. I am your mother and your name is Helene Reimann. And now count again the fingers. So? I always see only one finger. The ring finger with the wedding ring. I'm so ugly that they always have to deceive me? - I'll be alone forever. - Thankfully, she's sane. - Well... - Hello. - Hi. - This is super. You go forth with us. To you. The red ones I ate. I sent my boys into your old apartment. Make yourself no more thoughts. You have a bomb future ahead of you. Why are here actually so many blankets? My legs are gone and you would not tell me. No, your mother was afraid that you freeze. You only have a bump on the back of the head. You'll be released today. But you are in luck. Last week a lonely lady returned home and she was quite thin. We could do nothing more for she. What? Dried as a dead fly? - It can happen. - Don't make her afraid. - I'm sorry, I only wanted... - You wanted only! Who was abandoned doesn't need to be constantly noted. If you give a woman a nice compliment or something else, she increase her self confidence again. If you do not plan to nurse my daughter or marry her, please go out. We can do that here quite well alone. Sorry, I... I'll be out there. Mami, you're a real pitbull. - Why not, when it comes to you? - I'm like this. - Papi! Yeah? - Is it better? - Carl? Already back from the Maldives? I'm incredibly sorry, but I have an awful lot to do. So, this and that and... yes, this. But "this" you said before. What are you going to do? But I'm almost ten years older than you. I have such beautiful eyes? I have normal eyes. Yes, brown. Well, a meal. Because you insist with it. Yes, okay. I have to go. I have an appointment. Yes, me too. Thank you. Bye, bye, bye. - Ah, sorry. - I have a schedule too. - Who was that? - A friend. - I know them all. Who was then? - I have met in the bar. Do you move through the bars to make acquaintances? - In Caf? clicking perhaps? - Is this a quiz show? Your coffee, with three pieces of sugar. The way you like it. - No, thanks. No sugar for me. - What? At once? - Yes, I have just changed myself. - How so? No one takes 30 years too much sugar and suddenly no more. You also have 30 years said "I love you" to me and now you say it to a phsiotherapist. Look, this is the battery of you mobile. How did you get on the phone with your friend? Alas, this isn't a battery. Really, you check nothing. This is... my new mini-highspeed-wifi-sound system. From Apple. Now everyone has that. Aha, have you been at Apple? Yes, of course. I am always there. Sorry, I have to go. I have computer course. Ah, you take me once to Apple? Yes, perhaps. Hello. My name is Mrs. Pauli. I bid you welcome to the "Cyber-Bees". In the next two weeks we learn here with a lot of fun the dealing with the computer. First I want you to simply close the open window. Please close the open window. So. The window is closed. I'm also attracted to thin. Eieiei. Is there someone at the very beginning, isn't it? Not that you also try to catch the mouse. No, I know a few things. For example, I am in facebook. My daughter sign me up in Twister and Wikileaks. Sorry. Cyber-Bee, I'm right? I think it would be nice if our parents would be together again. No offense, but I met Papi in the center other day. He was thinking about a tattoo. Carl Reimann! So a rascal. - Not funny. - Somehow. And where he wants to get tattooed? Welcome home. - Completely different. - Nice, isn't? You can put yourself forward. Use the corridor. - How do you find what here? - It's all sorted. According to what? By annual rings? No, according to outfits. - Tell me a look, any. - Ahn, Madonna? - The early or the late? - Now I'm floored. - That would be something for tonight. - Yes. But I have lovesickness. I thought we would eat pizza, I'd cry and you'd comfort me. That sounds nice and full, but: Nope. Did you really stand, chasing one that doesn't make it, to impregnate any woman? Oh, I'm such a Honk. I should look for someone who decides for me. Take my system. I've never cried after someone. Right. Here howl just me. It begins with stage A, B and C. You have to sleep with anyone in the next 24 hours. What? Even if I feed so bad? You want to feel yourself better. So: You have lovesickness for, let's call him, "Man A". You go to bed, most directly on the same day, before the proper lovesickness comes with any "type B". To emotionally totally confuse you. The change in your subconscious process is not as fast and deceives you, you were crushed in type B. That's wrong, but it deflects off totally from the epicenter. To avoid that you get lovesickness for B, as soon as possible, you look for the next, type C, and have immediate sex. Because then you're emotionally so sore and think, of course, you're in love. And then you have to get type D and so on. When has it an end? When I went through the whole alphabet? - I'm already overwhelmed with. - Better overwhelmed than fully sad. Eventually the grief comes anyway, but it's easier because then type A or B become buggered from the beginning. But type A won't come back, because type A, as asshole, is now with the stupid Monika. Do you think you can forget it easily? - Maybe. - I would classify me low. - The lawyer doesn't know my name. - The guy doesn't go. Besides the fact that you don't want him back, he comes, of course, buggered. You must not take that so seriously. Men have no idea about their feelings. That doesn't work with me. I cry afterwards any guy, even though I know that this is a dumbass. That's just a matter of choise. Who wants to start a stuffy family when we can be wild wolves in the prairie? Oh, my God! Socializing is so great! Why was I so long away? I was a little too good. Hey, what's about drugs? What you take now? No idea. My drug is the music. We could smoke pot or heroin... Too hard, right? Hey, I don't believe. Over there is the guy from the hardware store. So many guys! I didn't know that there were so many. Hello, I come over to you. Now she turns fully through. Hello! - Well? - Well? Oh, God. The lawyer has just come. Three women? Is he a megalomaniac? He wants to divide his four and half minutes between them? How they scrub it! Now stay very cool. Are you crazy? For me, he can do it. With me, he has the least work. He has me already. Which is nothing. Keep going. Previously as a commercial photographer, I was incredibly insecure. Because I had rather weak women. In the midlife crisis everything falls apart. Have you then bought a motorcycle? The usual: motorcycle, married a stripper in Vegas. Everything sold and moved to the mandatory cabin to Canada. Since then I habe been crying a lot. And, of course, permanent erection problems. But, fortunately, everything works again. You have a lot to do. Margaux, I ask you now just very directly: Is there a man in your life? Well, so... It's quite difficult to avoid the so-called "men". Once you set a foot outside the door, they run all around freely. I mean a husband. Are you married? Yes, I had a husband. Ahn...But my husband is... so... - My man is gone from me. - For God's sake. - Yes. - Ah, I'm so sorry. - I should not remember. - No, no. It's fine. Now I order me something good. Scandalous as Uncle Sam placed one as stones in the way. From the small to the large widow'spension. Bad! Yes, I... So, I have no idea of all the paperwork. I habe pushed it through for my sister. - I can took over the taxes of the documents. - No, you can't. What kind of person am I? You cannot talk about it. How long ist it from? There is a... ahn... nine months. Nine months? How long were you married? 35 years. Options! Guy A, then B, then C. That changes everything. This is a mega-system. - Do you really want to go with each into bed? - Yes! Of course, not having all. One goes from A to B to C and back to A. Or B? I forgot it. Never mind! I thought you were actually rather shy. It's over. So, I'm drunk. But I had so much fun today. This is a sign, right? I'm going soon. If you wanted to meet me. - Where are you going? - To feed my dogs. - And who are you? - Peter M?ller. - Peter M?ller? Really? - My parents were not as creative. - Hi, Mr. M?ller. - I'm pleased. I'm Vivienne. Vivi. - Vivi? - Mhm. Are you coming with me or are you watching on your crazy friends? Perhaps would it be better. - Don't go home alone. - Leni? She is not so. She just wants heroin. But she tosses her hair back, Duckface... You just looks focused. - Focused? - Mhm. Did you ever get someone into bed? Yes, many. Without any problems. - You would not get me to ted. - Sure. Immediately. - You would not remember. - What do we do then? - I don't want to get you to bed. - You're talking about. - Your started with this. - That's not the point. You come now with me? Think about whether you want to be B or C. A is my ex. Okay... That was a joke. Isn't it? It was a joke. So, purely hypothetical: If that was not a joke, I'm the guy B and C, without guy A coming again. So the system doesn't work. No, we need one more. Find one here at the middle point. Good evening, Berliner. I am Guy Cohen. Let's have a wonderful night today. Let's run off And we'll go chase out fairy tales They don't need to come Oh, I wanna dance with you And sail through the sun Lying on fluffy clouds While we sip on bottled rum Oh, I wanna dance Have some syncopated fun I'll be dying before I'm 80 But you'll still hear me and my drum You know, you've heard it all before Leave your questions by the door We don't care who answers them You can't just sit around and cry Take my hand and learn to fly Next thing you know You're out the door Oh, I wanna dance with you And sail through the sun Lying on fluffy clouds While we sip on bottled rum Oh, I wanna dance Have some syncopated fun I'll be dying before I'm 80 But you'll still hear me and my drum The other day it ran something interesting on TV. Goldfish remember only the last three minutes. They swim in circle and think: "Wow, who is this great fish ahead? it looks good." And presto, they have already forgotten. Lug around without all mental ballast. They are free. Oh, that sounds complicated. - Yes. - So joyous. What? You started. With the fish that have affairs everywhere. It was in television. In public. Oh, my husband. Very quiet, this is the subconscious. A hallucination. Not as flashy or he sees me. - Accept it: he's dead. - He is here. So you will never free your heart for new acquaintances. Hey, Margaux! Are you hiding from me? - Good Evening, I'm her husband. - Ex-husband. - I just dropped something. - I thought you were dead. - Not that I know. - I didn't say "dead". - I have formulated it very differently. - And how? Let's act just as if we were goldfish and forget all this nonsense dating. I'm gone. About what is your script? About three actors with tousand s part-time jobs, that hope for a good role. That has personally nothing to do with you? Null. It is hard to get roles. For me, anyway. How so? If you come to my selection for guy B or C, I need quite a few information. I participated in a children's series. My father always said I can go abroad with the money. Then he decided to clean my account and go abroad himself. After that I did a while taking all possible drugs. Was not such a good idea. Yeah, right. You are "Tommy with a Smile". - What happened next? - I have made withdrawal and started again from scratch. Maybe I should frighten me now. But the really interesting people all have something already undergone. Also fits better to you now, where will you get laid all types. Yes, exactly. Who knows, maybe I'll do even a threesome? Of course, not with another guy. I can call a girlfriend who sure latch on to you. - She is mega-dirty. - Right now? I don't want any other woman. Do you want a threesome without sex with another woman or another guy? What makes the gender-neutral third person? Maybe something nice to read? I find so sweet that you're not in Berlin. Well, at least you were a drug addict, right? Oh crap, I have to help my sister. - You stay here, okay? - Yes. - Leni! - Right here, okay? - Right hier. - Okay. - Vivi! - Hey. - Hello. - You are really drunk. Igitt. Why are you so wet? I had to wash the jean jacket. Are you also hungry? Can you please bring my girlfriend home safely? Gartenstrasse 6. - But I'm your sister. - She'll vomit on it all. Maybe, maybe not. Gartenstrasse 6, please. Can we stop somewhere? I have to buy bananas. This is the guy of the children's series. Hey, guy! Sell me your smile. Hey, I'm talking to you, man. - It is good now. - Nah, I'm serious, man. - Smile at me. - Man, come down. Come down? I want you to smile, man. Come, Tommy. Smile. - Let's talk. - Out! I habe done nothing at all. Please! I have to go in there again. Fuck! - I'm sorry, old man. - Shut down your lips. I found your series so cool. I had your poster above my bed. Because of you I'm studying movie. I can take a picture for my Instagram? That would be my biggest dream, man. - Okay. - Cool. The evening is gone. - Thank you. You are the best! - Merci! Duh, that's probably now fully Berlin. Oh, my god, he is here. - He looks so good. - But not like last time. If one of us gets it, we meet at platform 8, ok? Hey, my pocket! Sorry, my pocket. Hush, sorry. Sorry. My pocket becomes caught. I'm not a groupie or something. Okay. Can I still invite you for a drink? - I am Guy. - Leni. Actually, I'm here with someone. - A guy? - Yes. Dark hair, blue t-shirt. Or was it gray? - Here is so bad light. - He just walked past me. He was smooching with a girl. - Really? - Yes, sorry. "Nutrive Anti-Aging-Overnight- Beautyrepair-Lipid-Recovery-Complex "with Tocopherol and Vitamin E Oxidans. "Knock the cream gently for a Magical Glow." Leni? Hannah? It's me, Carl. I miss you, Margaux. I miss you too. I'm sorry that I said you're dead. That happened already. Do you really want that? Would I be here otherwise? Have you actually dogs? You have only played with me. Of course. Your grandmother comes from Berlin, you comes from Tel Aviv. But now you live in New York? That's cool. Are you finished with the questioning? Do you want fingerprints? I live in New York, but I prefer stay away. Maybe Berlin? So, how about drinks? Okay. Do you have a flask with you or how do you do that in New York? I thought the dog food was a trick to catch me around. It is indeed. I wanted to make it hot for us. Pasta and oregano. - Delicious. - Sure, of course. I am chef. Papa is at home! Wow! - This is the girl pasta. - I designed her. - That's my job. - Brand designer or what? She has Leni in her Caf?, that is always focused on the ring. That is, if we eat it, you get what you deserve. It is also a bit of my apartment. Can you help me with the pots? - Uh, how many dogs have you got? - At the moment 21. Why do you create so many dogs? I went to the animal shelter and they looked at me so depressed. Then I took a few of them. I was told that they were neutered. But they were not. Konstantin von Solingen What you say may be used against you in court. I just wanted to say: It's cool with me that you now likely go with someone home. I'm happy for you. Just wanted to let you know... I also met someone very great. Then I say now... Bye. - Hello. - Wow! Os what is that? I can't believe it. Saint Dogdorf or what? The miniature golf course went bankrupt. Then I bought a few houses and the little ones like it. You're the funniest guy who has ever come across me. Look, this is Bob. Hello! I think he looks like you. He's also a handsome guy. Isn't it, Bob? Hello. Oh, God. Yes, you are so cute, so cuddly. I'll tell you rather that: I can give you my phone number, but I don't want to know your ascendant. I'm not on the search for a boyfriend. No, not at all. Lion. Libra. That is so romantic here, like in the old movies. I liked when the women fall in fright fainted and the hero has carried them out of danger. Then the women have always breathed: "Where am I?" And the hero has told them that they are safe. Do you like hero? There must be more than Sunday brunch and flea market. But then the guy is a liar and fucks the Accountant department. Oh, hoppala. To find one, a woman should be happy. As in clearance sale. As if I were a scratchy sweater in rear shelf. It's about your ex, right? He broke up with you? No, I broke up. It was clearly my decision. Okay, perhaps not quite true. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. It was so beautiful with you tonight. Yes. Gorgeous. - Give me a coffee? - Yes. I take three pieces sugar. I lied yesterday. Oh, glue disc. I have to go soon. Say quietly "shit". The children have left home. Where do you have to go? I promised Birte that I would go with her to brunch and to the flea market. - What? - The kids get to eat. I'd rather leave before they see me here. - Is there anything delicious? - Pork medallions. Oh, that sounds... That sounds... Well then. I take the garbage with me. Then you don't need to... No. Do what you want. Yes, I hang up now. Yes, really. That was your colleague lawyer? He accuses me that I have a new guy. Somebody puked on my jeans jacket yesterday. Disgusting. - Hm, barbecue-feeling. - I'm ashed. But it is quite clear why your guy is behaving this way. - Aha? - He has fear of loss. Total projection. Because he dances with the coils, he had the idea that you also have a different wish. Bamm. Fear of loss. The men that shoot their wives by jealousy. He has plenty of hallucinations. - What men reinterpret everywhere. - Yes, ridiculous, isn't it? Why you bought so many bananas? Since when do you eat fruit? Well, fructose tastes me good too. Girls! I know I look like shit. But I'm feeling so good. - You have sexy hair. - Bingo. We don't have really sex. I met the most amazing guy! - Was clear. - I'm telling you: This is the father of my children, my dream man. Hannah, you'll be aunt. And you godfather aunt. God, I think it's just the 1950s. Margaux? Huhu! Hello, Gundula. I want to ask you whether we should take you together to the tennis. I forgot it completely. That doesn't suit me well. Nah, come now. That won't be pinched. We have been entered already. - Was Carl with you today? - No, why? I saw his car in the driveway. Short. Because of the health insurance. Yes, now he makes the gym without prescription. At home. Oh, my God. Margaux. - Sometimes I'm so insensitive. - That's fine. A musician who doesn't know he's sexy? - Everything clear. - He have moth holes in the t-shirt. He doesn't care how he looks like. Ha only wants to make good music. We see perhaps later. He has accomplished many appointments. But I told him I have time. Just like I. - I have batteries. - Oh, thank you. - Have you ever Googled him? I want to meet him normal. That's a normal acquaintance. - Have you Googled your dog lover? He doesn't interest me at all. He's called Peter M?ller, ungooglebar. There are 1,356,000 Peter M?llers. - Then you have googled him. - Total routinely. - Hier, batteries. - No longer need them? No, this thing sents only mischief. How it looks like. That skin color. "I'm not made of plastic, I'm real penis with veins." As someone had shot at the fairground. I found it yesterday. Here I was eight. I look cool. - I have to go back. - Sweet. The probability that you'll be eight again is not high. I mean, how lucky I was. Then I had power. - With eight? - Yes, I led a band. I had a tadpole breed and a flute. I was a right decision maker. I have to clean my whole personality today. Thank God. I have only shortly clicked the mouse. And the internet vanished. Believe me, you are not so powerful. Hello, my darling. Come in. - I haven't done anything. - Mami, you always say that. Why are you still in nightgown? This is more comfortable. I can't have hired a lot. I can't go into many pages. I can't make this double click. - You only have to press twice. - But with monkey's full speed. It's easy to say. Here on the first page from the internet... On the first page of internet? Mama! It's okay. - Do you go to the computer course for nothing? - I'm not going back there. - Why not? - I can do it all. I want to see the computer course where you can do anything. I was following the course with a gentleman. - He has stuck his tongue in my ear. - Please? Ah, therefore you gave him a love bite? - Then what did you do? - Don't be so stuffy. Who is Birte Schottenhammel, that you're googling constantly? The girlfriend of my father. I'm hungry. Shall we eat what now? Are you jealous? Would anyone like a piece of Railway cake? If you return with someone from the computer course, - use condoms. - We don't always do it. - I'm just worried. - It's all okay. Chill out. No one has to worry about. I fell just fine. I mean... The rear seats are actually stupid, but I'll get used to it. - How rear seats? - In the car. If you are separated, You sit back next child seats or smelly dog coats. Ahead go the couples who are together. Gundula and Norbert take me afterwards from tennis. That has been going. I can do it. So, if that's your only problem... We are the coolest when we cruise When we head through the city We are the collest when the sweet ladies greet us with kisses We are the coolest when we cruise When we head through the city We are the coolest, never on loose Because we rule when we cruise What? There is she: Birte Schottenhammel. The Birte aka new grilfriend of your husband? Remain quite cool. Frau Reimann? I have to talk to you. Ah, hello. Ahn, we know each other? Don't put yourself more stupid than you are. Carl had not cleaned you garage yesterday. I'm not stupid. But I'll tell you a thing: Don't jump around with me. With all due respect, you have deceived me with my husband first. So what? It's not about that now. Tell me now, what happened with Carl yesterday. Why don't you ask your friend? I'm in the middle of the talk! Could this night with Carl... Could that stay with us, please? I don't want my daughters to be bothered with it. For sure. You're a real lady, Miss Reimann. I always wanted to be like you. You're the only one that never reminded me that my dad's gone. He missed a wonderful daughter, who he should be very proud. - Thank you. - So. Now I need a drink. My heart flutters like a hummingbird. I can't jinx your wife so she wants sex. These are just a tarot cards. Something about drugs? Listen, I'm sure that is a criminal offense. Just crazy. - Hi. - Hi. - I get a coffee? - For sure. I'm sorry that I got away. There was such a mess with a serie's fan. Yes, these fans that kiss, even if aren't careful. - Of what you're speaking? Nothing, small wit. I had a great night. Absolutely beautiful. Yeah, I too. By the way, I was invited to the casting. For a cinema reel. - You bring me good luck. - What? I'm happy for you. How exciting. You're gonna get the text before? Yes, it's quite long. I can't get it to the head. But I can practice with you. It's boring anyway. Yes, that would be nice. Only if it's okay to you to neglect the other guests. - Now hand over. - This is a love story. With old costumes and such. A bit cheesy. "For you I roam through forests and climb on rocks." "You are my queen." "Even if you're blind to me, I'm optimistic, " "I believe in love and do all this with pleasure, mylady." That is beautiful. Why men talk no longer so? - Because it sounds stupid? - What a shame! If you are, like me, since yesterday in love, you found it beautiful. Oh yes? Could be good that it's similar to me. Do you see? You have to use while playing. Feel it, then the text is all by itself. Since yesterday I feel so light and happy. You're right. I should use it. Really transparent that you can simply say so. Otherwise I'm not a groupie. How embarrasing. Hey, it's been forever. It's okay if you appreciate good work. You're not so a groupie for me. It's about that one finds a human fine. - That one can imagine something. - Yes. - Exactly my talk. - Yeah, isn't it? When someone is so incredibly funny, and also sentimental and sensitive, almost like a woman. You just have to listen. That's all. And these beautiful eyes with long eyelashes. So, now I'm equal embarrassed. Well, I stop you fully chatting by Guy. Ahn, by whom? Guy, the singer of yesterday, in which I'm so in love. Mr. Nice Guy. - Ah, the singer? - Yes. He's null lofty, quite different from other famous musicians. He moved to Berlin. Maybe to make friends. Yes. He's definitely a totally cute guy. But enough whispering, it's not about me. It's about you. That is much more important. - Let's start now? - Yes. Okay. Margaux, hello. - Morning. - Hello. Let me sit down bliefly, ok? I think it's great that you dare again to a tournament. - What, please? - You signed. Isn't it truth? - It was at the last minute. - No, definitely not. - Hm, delicious. - I have test anxiety. I prefer to eat on my arm than I here... You stand there on the list, with the time and everything. Perhaps one of your daughter have entered you? Oh-oh. I know who could have been. - Uiuiui. She has also signed up. - What a bitch. I can't do this. Maybe I can write an apology to a doctor? No, no. Who is signed must play. Politicians can resign for corruption, but here at Blue-White we don't bend. This square deserves a beating. She may be quite pretty, a bit younger, she can run like a hare, but you have more experience. You're much, much older. "And now? You love, with your love you are alone." "I know I can't love you, Mylady, " " but I shall be your faithful servant." She loves one so much, but watch how she married the other... Wow. Well, I see it other way. He waits a moment and is quickly gone, as she thinks. But the fact is, he has until his death waited in vain for her. Good that the Middle Age is over. - Can we now go on? - Yes. Miss Reimann? You have again ignored our iMelody strategy. Und eating again. Bravo. Excuse me, Mr. Dr. Hengesbach. But who actually uses that software, I had a feeling... - A feeling. You had a feeling? - Yes. My Rottweiler has a "feeling", but he's not looking around in the office and he hasn't clientes. We are among the top 5 law firms. - I think that is great. - And you know why? We employ only the best. - The best of all. - Thank you! We only provide lawyers who belong to the "insecure overachievers", the A-type, people who are highly intelligent and uncertain, and therefore the maximum efficient. Yes, so insecure, I'm sometimes. The close observation of your work plus your little jagged appearance... And this flea market handbag! There go 100 euro to illiterates in Marocco. Ahn? Miss Reimann, you make me crazy. I was wrong: You're a "Insecure Underachiever". - What? - A D-Type. A preson who is insecure and rather average intelligent. Have you called me stupid? I've said "medium intelligent". You don't fit in here. The personnal department cares about you. You can go. Yes, it's indeed Sunday, isn't it? For young lawyers is a normal working day. Take care. Uh! Uff, it makes me feel better. Much better. That thing you can pull off my salary, Mr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Hengesbach. And by the way: My name is Mrs. Reimann. I also don't call you Miss, because you have these dry style. Yes, I may be a lousy lawyer. And yes, I cried, so what? Usually I eat total little. Only here, when I'm with you, I have stark sugar shortage. Here prevails a coldness, you fucking overachiever. Do you think there out you find someone cool? No. You are exactly the undiving buttass who none is allowed to depreciate. Just because you have a checking account and use it casually, you're cool? Pah! And now to you. You wife connoisseur, you. Here. Jesses Maria. What a shit, really. If I might push it in your ass, we could talk about the boozer thing. Oh. - At the end you say "my love". - Okay, my love. - Thanks for listening. - Much pleasure, my love. I think you were a pretty good knight. - Ui! You have the engagement ring. - This one? It exists only once in each pack. - I've never had him. - What does that mean? - That you'll marry very soon. - Okay. - Have you panned something for tomorrow? - Oh, God. Oh my God! I have one too. Pure science can't explain that. Shall we call NSA or Interpol? This is a historic moment. Seriously. That never happens again in life. Want that? So... To marry? Get children? We live on a plastic planet. Where you look out, the bottles, the bags that end up in the sea. No one thinks about it. A huge problem. - With the plastic now? - Yes. Can I educate someone if I am inconsistent myself? There are also children that haven't good live. Then there are people that are mega annoyed by their children. They live outside and have a trampoline in the garden. And it weathered. Maybe you hear out that I'm undecided. No, we heard null about it. I give you a tip: Life isn't going as how it looks like. Is that, you wise Oracle? We can, of course, still plan before who is buying the trampoline. You're really funny. Hey. Now? Mhm. Bye. Guy is at the hotel. I should go there. - That he announce himself... - It's nice. - I don't know... - Anyway I'm out of here. We can practice a bit of text. I'll build to you a few mnemonics. No, let it be. See you, okay? - Yes, please? - What's wrong with you? - The 'dry style' fired me today. - Oh. It was sucha a dream job: A cute Chef, affair with the morons and the whole recognition. Fuck. I'm sure you'll find something new quickly. In the prevention app, the infertile days have heart and the fertile days have crosses, right? - No, the other way. - Fuck. I knew it. Can you please see if my vaginal ring is in the refrigerator? Did you have any condoms? Only three. The other two times, we took care for. Five times? Oh God. Peter M?ller, the sex monster. Tadaa! The ring is definitely here. Everything palletised. No. It was all palletised if the thing would be inside me. Agrees. I get the morning after pill. I'll be home and be comforted by you. Ciao. - Yes, hello? - I was having a nervous breakdown. My first tennis match after 23 years. I have palpitations! - Margaux, is that you? - Yes. Why was I always too cheap to buy me chic tennis stuff? My legs are white and I have varicose veins. - Okay, calm down and stop to eat. - This is a power bars. Put it away. We're looking on your win. - I don't have any. - Don't complain. I have tomorrow also something important. We'll activate your willpower. So: what is your fight mantra? - Fight mantra? Is that with Yoga? This always looks so complicated. No, this is an encouragement sentence that you say or yell. - I've learned to change something. - What do you yell? "I stop to take coke because I die otherwise." Oh, God. I'm sorry. But somehow it doesn't fit absolutely right to me. Now I have another, you also may need another. Okay. How about: Love Mantra, it would be great if I don't lose so high in my match. It would be nice if few people saw and my hair sit exceptionally well. No novels, please. Take what are you proud. Pff, I can't. You'll find something. Will you call me? Yes, I'll do. How is your present mantra? I'm not telling. But it has to do with a woman. And what's her name? - Her name is Leni. - Leni? - But it isn't running. - As with my daughter. That can bring you only happiness. I press you very solid thumbs, du lieber Joseph Merlin. Thank you. Me too. When I sing this song now Just for me I can spread my wings and finally Even if it's almost no fault Just for me I can spread my wings and finally Well you're here with me Sorry I had to leave now Sorry I had to leave now It's for you. I wrote it for you. Nice. But so sad. "Sorry I had to leave now"? - Do you have to go now? - Sometimes you go without reason. - Even if everything is beautiful. - But then you can also stay. Better to go when all is well. If you stay, life is over quickly. And you fight on trash taken away and other stupid stuff. And that's just bullshit, you know. I think it's not bad to get garbage out. Do you have garbage? I'll take it away for you. - Gucci? - Yeah. I thought that's ancient. Because of the holes. No, the sylist makes that. Clothes don't matter to me. A stylist to give you holes? Yes, otherwise it looks shit. Wow, what's this? - I was looking for this. - A curling iron? - Yes. - It's funny. With ceramic surface, makes no ends split. Best thing ever. I thought your hair was like this. How do you know the hair straightener. You have to know, very important word. Relax, baby. It's just a fucking smooth-hairthing, you know. We don't have to have sex with it. Sorry, sorry. Now I'm fully in the matter. - Hello. - Hi. What's going on here? I didn't want to hang out and make a moodboard. I always wanted to be a lawyer, even though I've been just too bad. - What is this board here? - That's the moodboard. A technique from the advertising industry. Here you glue the images that one addresses internally. Then I know where is running for me the hare. Cool, isn't it? A monkey and a piece of ice? That has approached me, the monkey was so natural. Is the morning after pill in it? And until when have you taken it? No later than tonight. - And what's all that? - I'm so panicked. Beside the pharmacy was a shop with 50-percent sale. I understand. 50 percent is also a good discount. I'm sick with fear of the future, but I can not take the thing. You have time. And no matter what, I'll help you. Oh, my God, that's him. Baddest that now he call me calculatedly. - Is that telepathy with his sperm? - No. I stalked him earlier. - Have you stalked a guy? - Yes. He was so sweet, he was with his dogs. And one of them was able to make high-five. What kind of strange noise is that? Oh, man. No wonder I never heard that noise. Come here. I think all the time that is certainly difficult to teach dogs. Not everyone can do it, right? I don't know anyone who can. Peter M?ller sounds as if he could train our child well. Seat, place, paw. This is the perfect dad. I find me always guys I don't care. My ex-boyfriend has never asked me anything. Well, I don't know to this day how his job is called. Something with Manager Digital Distribution. Or was it Digital Content of Distribution of Management Manager? Something with "sale" yet. Are you listening? - Say, are you sleeping? - No, no. I'm listening. I'm so sorry, Guy, I purely projected thousand things in you. As a maggot, I slip in situations. That I don't want more. - What's a maggot? - An animal. The little hamster who eat car tires? - No,that is a marten. - Marten. It doesn't matter now. - I have to finish with us. - What? I'd better go. Hey. Wait a minute. Why are you going? Because I need to be a butterfly or bird, or what more I know, maybe some maggots are like. Wait. Don't go. I really want you to stay. You complicated beautiful Berlin girl. Stay! I'm really something from zero Berlin. It's so ridiculous. I was beginning to think we have children. Kids? I have seven. I love them but it's enough. What please? Seven children? Yes, I'm alwayx on tour. It can happen. But the kids are all with their mothers. Only on Christmas, they come to me. We eat pizza. You should come. Ahn, no... Why didn't you tell me that? - You didn't ask for. - Ah, of course. Next time I ask everyone whether he has seven children. Or Google? Hey, modern times. I had googled you. I hate Google and Skype. What everyone has to do with the Internet? I have to be a communication's technician to fall in love? This is now everything too stupid to me. We live on a plastic planet. On a huge plastic planet. You know? This is not how it's supposed to be. Germans. Always problems and discussions. Hey, there are you. What are you doing here? I have to talk to you. This singer is an idiot, but I'm most. Of course, it was shit, that you were snogging in the club, but we begin before the beginning. - Just you and me? - I were snogging? I know it, okay? Because it didn't work with the Singer, are you now in love with me? - Mhm. - Must you always have a boyfriend? No. It was at time. Oh, it's now really stupid. It was stupid that I went yesterday, although it was so nice. And now you come and should I springen? I can take you together in the car. Ey, I'm ranking from the casting. Is it only about your problems? Do you think you're the only one who has been jilled? Don't become to make yourself a mega head, it's frustrating. I know no one who thinks as much as you. I don't know why this is so. I have so often my heart broken. - Hello, floppy maggot, I say. - Do you listen to yourself ever? - What are you doing? - Why? Hey, colleague. We have fully horny MDMA at the start. - Do you want something? - No. My buddy is in a French film seminar. Bonjour, bonjour. Let's go, I have to go home - Au revoir. Sorry that you have flown from the club. Okay. You dragged anyone? The Druffis? Do you want something from them? I am well informed about French film... See, Leni. I can't be bothered by someone like you. I feel just fine. Joseph? - How was your casting at all? - I have the role. Yay! I'm glad for you. According to moan, you can't estimate the hardness of the ball. - Bedroom decoration. - What? Bedroom? Bedroom decoration. That's my fight mantra. - Bedroom decoration. - Here she comes. Oh! Bedroom... Bedroom decoration. Cunt. Bedroom decoration! Great! Hello, Mami? Mami? - Oh God, I'm dead? - No. If that is an intermidiate realm here and I habe little time: Don't depend on a man. Sometimes be crazy. Make oral sex. What? Mami? - These are great tips. - Make down the lamp. - I think that confuses her. - Good Morning. Oh, hello. I thought I had died. No, Mrs. Reimann. You live. You had a mild heart attack. So, as is said, very slight. - We wish you a nice reha... - Oh, wrong. - Hello, Mr. Hegemann. I'm right back. - Yes, yes. - Hello. - Hello. - I had a heart attack, and you? - Me too. You don't look like after a heart attack. You could more likely have a quite juvenile appearance: Appendicitis, almonds out, broken arm. Thank you very much. This is so charming. Yes, it was the tennis. A sport accident. What have you brough down? Four teenage daughters. Two fo them finally have a friend. one is lesbian, and the fourth hates me, because she isn't allowed to ride through Kazakhstan. So just because of the Reha. I've got an info leaflet for you. Miss Reimann. Mr. Hegemann. There is a fleet infarct wheeled troop. It's called "The Broken Hearts Club". The Broken Hearts? Oh, that's ludicrous. Yes, that was in my tarot cards. - Since when do you do that? - It's a long story. Well, then I go again. Afterwards, I could make some tea for you. Chamomile, rosehips, caraway? We wallow here in luxury. That would be wonderful. Those things are from the East. Hello, how is it going? The flowers are by Birte. It's incredibly uncomfortable to her that she... That she said "cunt". No matter. I also think that she is a cunt. To be honest, you too sometimes. - Mami! - Sorry. I just had a near-death experience. Since that, we turn more honest. Yes, yes, that might be. Who war this guy just on the side. Would you take a coffee with me? Occasionally. Would you like to chat wih me? Occasionally. Hello. This time you're even retired. Do you have a coffee, occasionally? And so, a chat? - What? - Man, I don't know you absolutely. I know nothing about you, I can't google. What do you want to know? You're here, I can tell you everything. - I don't know. - Why did you googled me? Man, I don't know how I... ...how should I do now. Watch out: I cannot drink coffee because... I may be pregnant from you. Okay... Cool. Stop a short. I wanted to pack it gently, but I have no idea how. On pillow embroider or compose a song? You need not take on obligations, you also don't have to make any gifts or so. I'm in myself, not as a family person. But I fix this, easy. Basically I wanted you just say about it. Here. - Wait. - Yes? Hear it. When you... I... If we have a child, then I will be there. I have nothing against commitments. I'll like to share with you a pillow. That would be good, Mr. M?ller. Why don't we try it out? You can come home, yelling at me. I'll bring you then knock on the door and everything, ok? That sounds good. That I fix out. Do you see? You're full of family character. Miss Reimann, here Dr. Hengesbach. Now there are a few problems about iMelody. You had a great thought. You probably will not grudge our little dispute, ok? Ah, there just bring me Miss Alberti a message from you. Dear Dr. Hengesbach, fuck yourself in the knee. Forever. - Cool, isn't it? - You've done it? And that's not all. The chef of iMelody has offered to me a super job. Wow. You-worker. See? You're back at eight. - And? Dou you do it now? - I don't know. At first, I'll look at waterfalls, adventure spots, and I tell you after that. - This all sounds very very nice. - You, tell me... Small family reunion. I have told him. Beautiful, we now have a really good cut. Then I have only screwed up. My own fault, cheap casanova. I'll see, someday you'll forget him. No. He stays. Forever.
