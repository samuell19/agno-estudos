The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye. For sure. You know, honey, you've invited me to dinner so many times in the last couple of months, it's almost like we're married already. I wish we were, darling. It's been a long year. For both of us. - Oh, wow, wow, you really love me. You really love me. Oh, wow, okay. Oh. Give me a kiss, give me a kiss. There we go. Such a good pup. I'm beautiful because I exist.

You've been at the gym when you should have been getting my money. Don't hit my face, dude. Don't hit my face! Fuck, man, alright! You've got three days, and I'm taking your guitar. - Take my fucking guitar, man. Come on, dude. Fine, I'm taking your fucking dog instead. - You can have the fucking dog, that's fine.

What do you think about that? Goddammit! Have a good weekend, Matt. - Fuck you guys, man. Get the fuck outta my house. Fuck you bitches up. Good dog, that's a good dog. - Fuck. My question is, how do you find the balance to where sometimes you give too much attention, and you feel like you're smothering, and if you don't, then you go to, like, not giving nothing to them at all? Yeah, I got an answer for that one, Greg. Ask her what she wants. Should appreciate the fact that they're honest, and relationships grow as people grow, likely delusional, seasons change. Make sure that you are aware of the changes, not only in the other person, but within yourself, and you effectively communicate things, then you won't wake up in the midst of a nightmare. Amy, come here girl. Come here! Or should I put my foot down? Where the hell is my dog, man? What's going on? Love is the only answer. Come on, come on. What's going on? Supposing Glenn never gets over wearing girl's clothing? Would it matter to you very much? What the hell is this? I love Glenn. I'll do everything I can to make him happy. 10 fucking thousand dollars? - Look, everything's gonna be fine, alright? - Three days, what the fuck are we, what we are gonna do, man? Ah, man, I'll figure it out, alright? - Who the fuck has my dog? - Butch. - Bitch? - Butch! - Why did you go to him for money, man? - Look man, on my last fucking album, alright, I took out a loan. I thought that was gonna be the one to pop, and it didn't, alright? I'm gonna... I'm gonna talk to Blill. I'm gonna see if Blill can-- Bill? - Blill. B-L-I-L-L. I don't know why the fuck his parents put that goddamn L there, but they did. I'm gonna have him call Butch, man, see if he can buy us some more time. - Why the fuck did they take my dog? - Look, it doesn't fucking matter. I wrote a new song and I really think that this is gonna be the one to fucking do it. Okay? I think it's gonna be big, man. Alright? Check this shit out. Check it out. That's the beginning. That's like the verse part. Then it goes to this chroma, chromatic thing. Like a,. It's like the break. I think it's pretty-- - You got us both fucking killed, man. Congradu-fucking-lations, man. - Butch is a fucking pussy, man. He's not gonna do shit. Alright? Simon. Come on, man.

I don't know how you wake up every day and do it. By do it, I mean being you. Don't know how you do it. I couldn't do it. But this one time, I just want you to pretend you're somebody else, pretend you're successful, pretend you have balls, pretend you're not a total fucking pussy and just be cool and trust me on this. Alright? - Matt, can you hear me? - Huh? Blill, Blill. - Hello? Hey, what's up man? - Blill, listen dude, here's the deal. Yeah, it's him, hold on. I owe Butch $10,000. He's giving us three days or he's gonna fucking kill me. Alright, I need you to call him and just give me a couple of more weeks. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, man. - He has Simon's dog. You remember Simon, my roommate. - Yeah, I ate a dog yesterday. I'm in Thailand, brother, I'm on vacation. What are you bothering me for? - I just need you to make a phone call. Can you ju-st call him for me, please? Just pick up the fucking phone and call? This is your own bullshit, man. - What do you want? - Do you even own a copy of my book? You know I've been busting my hump trying to sell a fuckin' book. I didn't even know you wrote a fucking book, man. - What the fuck? You don't know about my fucking book? I'll buy your goddamn book, alright? Why do you even owe him $10,000? I'll buy your fucking book. - That's fuckin' nothin', man. Why don't you go knock off a corner store and get that money? What the fuck? That's bullshit money, $10,000? He's not gonna kill you over $10,000. He'll cut your face off, but-- - Okay, well, I'd prefer that not to happen, either, so that's why I-- - Yeah, I prefer that not to, oh yeah, I'll just call Blill Masturbson, get him to call Butch, sort it all out. Then, I don't have to owe him 10 grand, get my dog back, everything will be fucking willy-nilly, fuckin' fine. And I don't have to worry about shit for the rest of my life, do whatever the fuck I want, no consequences? - Sounds great. - Is that what it is? - Sounds great, you think you can do that? - Yeah, man, no problem. What are friends for? Oh. The fuck are you doing, dude? Are you spying on me? - What's the plan? - What do you mean, what's the plan? - What are we gonna do? - Blill's gonna take care of it. He's gonna call him. Everything's gonna be fine. Blill? - Yeah. He's a stand-up guy, dude. - He gives you one-- - It'll be fine. - Maybe two days.

Louis doesn't respect me. My parents don't respect me. My brother doesn't respect me. Everybody at work, nobody fucking respects me. You know, my therapist, she says, "You give respect, you get respect." All the fuck I do is give respect. I respect everybody I fuckin' see. I even fucking respect people I've never even met. I'm not racist. I'm not prejudice. I'm selfless. I just don't get it. You know, I'm an artist, man. Alright? Dude, I just fuckin' realized that. I'm a centric, okay? I fuckin' wear weird shit. I say weird things from time to time, alright? It's a fucking art, you know? Nobody takes me seriously, you know, like a fucking joke. Man, Louis, thank you for tonight. Dude, this is fuckin' awesome. No problem, man. That's how I fuckin' roll every night. Shut the fuck up, man. What you mean that's how you roll every night? What? I'm fuckin' serious. You tell me that you blow all that fuckin' money on bitches and drugs, every night? - I'm fuckin' gangster. What, you're not fucking a gangster. What's this guy talking about? - Fuck yeah, I mean, my parents have stolen goods, so that's why I ... They give me all the money, you know? It must be nice, yeah not to do shit. Hey, you got a lighter, man? Jack, you're almost there. - Yeah. Hey, look, I'm fucking starving. Are you guys hungry? - Hypnotik. I guess I could eat. You could drive? Yeah, I could drive. I said are you sure? Just fuckin' look forward, dude. Is my seatbelt on? Yes, man. Oh, yeah. Ugh, shit. - The kid's passed out, man. Yeah, he's fuckin' shit-faced, man. The fucker knows how to party. Have you thought any more about what I was talkin' about earlier? - No, I didn't. Why not? - 'Cause it's a ridiculous idea. - Why is it ridiculous? - It's like being in a pile of shit, Matt, and then wanting to step into another pile. It doesn't make sense, man. - What? God dammit Matt, I mean fuck! - Hey, hey. Chill out. Chill out. Just fuckin' with you. Look man, I really think we should-- - Shut the fuck up, man. I don't wanna hear about that shit anymore. It's not a fuckin' option. How many times do I have to tell you? - Dude, what's the fuckin' worst that could happen? - There's a shitload that could happen. There has to be a better option. Come on, just fuckin' think. Use your head for once. Shit, dude! - Okay, this is something I thought up earlier: Louis. - What about him? - We kidnap him. Do you really think that fuckin' money talk is all real? - Fuck yeah it's real, are you kidding me? That guy's loaded. - No. Why would he be staying at that shitty motel, huh? - I don't know. Maybe he likes banging whores in shitty motels. That's how I would do it. Maybe he's fuckin' broke. - He's not broke, dude. Why would he be spending all the fuckin' money on us if he was broke? - He's fuckin' lonely, Matt. He just wants to be your friend. - Oh, isn't that fuckin' sweet and sentimental of you, Simon. You know, I don't know how the fuck to be lonely and rich at the same god damn time. - I don't know, man. How would we do it then? - All we gotta do is fuckin' drive him to the house, dig through his phone, find his parent's contact, call the fuckers and say, "Hey, we got your son." - And then they trace the fuckin' call and then it's game over. - What the fuck, they're in China, dude. They're not goin' to trace the phone. What are you talkin' about? This isn't some fuckin' shitty episode of Law and Order. For all I know, some drunks took his phone, and prank called random numbers. - I don't know, man. Dude, trust me on this one, man. I don't know. - Dude, trust me. Think about it, dude. You got some kid living over here, halfway across the fuckin' world, alright? He's got no job. He's droppin' a couple thousand dollars, at least, every fuckin' night. Where do you think that money's comin' from? Think it's just fallin' outta the fuckin' sky? - You're fuckin' sick, man. Seriously, you got a fucked up mind. - You got a fucked up mind. Man, I'm just tryin' to get us outta this mess. Yeah, the one you got us in. - Just look, Simon, you're gonna get your fuckin' dog back, alright? I'm gonna get my life back. And, you, hey, you know, maybe Louis will get a friend out of it. - Yeah, a fuckin' fake friend. - Some of the best friends I've ever had, are fake friends. - Fuck you! Fuck you, man! I wouldn't be sitting here if I was your fuckin' fake friend. - You're definitely not my best friend, especially if you're gonna talk to me like that. - You're a dick. Ah, you gotta chill. - Fuckin' asshole, man. Chill out, man, trust me on this. Alright? - I just want my fuckin' dog back, dude. - You and your fuckin' dog. It's always about the dog, you know? You forget they're gonna fuckin' kill me. Care if I score one of these? - No. - Come on, man, I'm so fuckin' hungry. - No, you should have fuckin' ordered some. There are mine. - I don't have any money, man. - No! Come on, please, just give me one. - I'm not gonna fuckin' share. I touched it. - Fuckin' dickhead man. So you don't care? - I know where those fuckin' fingers have been tonight, asshole. - Do you care if I have one now? - You better eat all of it. - Alright. - Gosh. - Thanks, man. Ugh! That tastes like shit! Shit, ugh! You on, get the light. God damn. I'll get it. How is he moving so much? I'll just get the lights. Come on, let's get him to the couch. Let's get him to the couch. Ah, shit! How is he? I'm so drunk! Ah, ugh, fuck! How'd he get so fucked up? - Dude, you-- - Is he awake? - You were the one feeding him shots. Be right back. - Gimme my shoes! - You shut the fuck up, man. - You shut the fuck up. You're drunk. - Stop. - Shut up. Come on. Get it goin'. There we go. The fuck are you doin'? - I was takin' off his pants. Why do you have his fuckin' pants off, man? I asked you to find his god damn phone. You got his pants off. - Dude, the guy is loaded! Did you find his phone? - Wait. Where the fuck is it, man? - Hey, nobody likes sleepin' with their pants anyways. - Just gimme the fuckin' phone, man. God damn! Hello? Is this Louis' dad? We have your son. - What is he saying? We have Louis. We need $10,000 by this time tomorrow night, or we're gonna kill your son. We're gonna fuckin' murder the shit outta your son, if you don't give us $10,000, by tomorrow. - Don't say that. What did he say? - He's gonna give us the money. Come here. - What the hell are you doin'? Come here. - What are you doin'? Just come on. - Come on. What are you doing? Look, I get it, I'm really upset, too. It's all gonna work out. I'm so scared. - Yeah, it's gonna be alright. This feels so good, so good. - Alright. I miss you. Come find me. - That little fucker. Matt. Ugh. - Hey man. Yeah. - Just, uh, you can eat anything that you find in there. Okay. - Pretty fuckin' good cereal, right? Yeah. It's always good, man. Especially when you get drunk. - Yeah, you have a good time last night? You remember any of it? - Mmm, I don't remember. - Just keep eating that stuff, man. You'll be alright. Thank you for this. - Yeah, no worries. - Shit. I cannot find my cell phone. Did you see my phone? - No, no. I don't know. Fuck. I don't know, man. - I can't find it, shit. I think that fuckin' stripper took my phone. - Uh, yeah. That's a possibility, man. That, she looked pretty sketchy. - Really, huh, fuck. - You remember, uh, remember what you did with your, your little pinky? Yeah-- - This one? - Or this one? - Funny man. We got a funny man here. Yeah, smell it, just smell it. Oh, no. - Yeah, yeah. Matt. The fuck? I can't believe you fuckin' phone off, man. We wasted a whole fuckin' night, got this guy over here, and you're fuckin' gone. Get your ass back here, fast. I don't know what to fuckin' do, man. I feel whole and complete. Smiling changes reality. I feel whole in places. I am one with the world. I feel whole and complete. Smiling changes reality. I feel whole because I exist. I am one with the world. I am whole and complete. Smiling changes reality. I am whole because I exist. I am one with the world. I am whole and complete. Smiling changes reality. I am beautiful because I exist. I am one with the world. I am whole. - Oh, fuck.

I was just out there to buy us some more time. - Well, did you? - I think so, yeah. How's the kidnapping going? What kidnapping, man? We're just fucking hanging out here. - Okay, great, he's still here. - Man, what the fuck are you talking about, man? Come on, like, I mean, did you talk to his dad? - I mean, I called him, but I couldn't understand a fuckin' word he said. I think he was speaking Spanish. - He's Chinese, man. - Stop being so negative, man. - What the fuck do you mean, man? What are we gonna do, Matt? God dammit, dude. - I really don't know. I mean, I think this is fine, what we're doing right now. - Oh yeah, of course it is. - It's working, he's here. He hasn't gone anywhere. Dammit. Hey, guys. - Hey. - Hey, do you have, uh, any food other that cereal? Check the fridge, man. - There's nothing there. - Yeah, nothing there. - Go to the fucking grocery store. - So, are you gonna go?

Okay, fine. - That's my fucking disk. Yeah, and I'll throw it from where it landed. - Where the fuck are you goin', dude? What the fuck, man? - You ready, mother fucker? It's goin' in the lake.

Do you think I'm gonna throw your fuckin' disk in the lake? Man ... - I'm not like that, man. That's a fuckin' $10 ... Fuck. What the fuck, dude! - Who's the bitch now? You, mother fucker! Hello? Hey, look I've got your fucking son, alright? And I'm about the kill him. Simon? - You fucking heard me. You better give me that $10,000, right the fuck now! Look, I'm standin' behind him now. I've got a fuckin' gun pointed to the back of his head. Okay. - Okay, good. Alright, now here's the deal. Here's where I want you to wire the money. Kill him. - Look, I'm not gonna fuckin' kill him if you pay me the money. That's the deal, okay? Okay. - Okay, good, so you're gonna pay, right? I pay you nothing. - Look, you're fucking pushing me, alright? I will fucking kill this mother fucker right now. Okay. Jesus Fucking Christ! Would you stop saying okay? No. - Look, I'm standing behind your son, right now! I've got a gun pointed at the back of his head! I'm about to splatter his brains all over this fucking wall. That boy has no friends. Stop calling me. - Hello? Jesus fucking Christ! God damn! It's gonna be fine, gonna be fine. How long you guys know each other? A long fuckin' time, man. He's like a brother to me, so ... - Hey, Matt. - Hey, what's up? - What's up? Found your phone. - What the fuck, man? You found my phone? - It was in my jacket pocket the whole time. And your dad called too. Was he pissed about his ransom? - What are you talking about, ransom? What the fuck is he talking about? What were you just talking about, dude? I didn't say shit. What do you mean? - I saw he gonna give you the money. What are you ... What are you talking about? - I'm fucking broke, okay? What do you mean, you're fucking broke? My parents cut me off! What was last night all about? - That's all the money I have. So there's no fucking money? - Yes! I have nothing left. Okay? The money I spent last night is the whole money I have. Fuckin'... God! I fuckin' told you, Simon! This was a horrible idea. - You knew the entire time? - Fuck yeah, man. You think I'm fuckin' stupid? Shit man, I'm sorry dude. - You got to be fucking kidding me! - Look, I like you guys. I like Matt. I like his music. - I appreciate that, thank you. That's why I spent-ed the whole money last night. And that's all I have. - Nobody fucking likes us. - I do. - Nobody hangs out with us. They're not going to give you any more? Even if you're fucking kidnapped? - I don't know. Hard to figure out if they will, but sometimes they won't. I'm sorry, dude. We just needed the cash. We were really desperate. We weren't going to hurt you, I promise. - This wasn't my idea. Fuck you, man! - You need to fuckin' be honest and tell the truth. What? - It wasn't my idea. We're sittin' in the diner the other night, and he was freakin' out. 'Cause they stole his fuckin' dog too, man. You know? And he's like, "I don't know what to do. "Maybe we should just kidnap the guy passed out in our car." And I was like, "You don't fuckin' do that to people." That's what I told him. And he looks at me, and he goes, "I do that to people." This was all his idea. - Fuckin' dickhead. You better shut the fuck up! You fuckin' know it was. - You better tell him the fuckin' truth. We were sitting in the fucking diner. - Fuck you, Matt. - It was your idea, man. - Fuck you, dude. - Just fuckin' admit it, dude. I've liked you the whole time, man. I wouldn't ever do this to you. - You're a fuckin' asshole, man. - Well I think this is pretty fucked up, what you did to Louis. I fucking give up. - We're wasting time, man. We need to get him back to his hotel. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on. - We gotta get the fuck outta here. We gotta figure out what the fuck we're gonna do, man. Wait, okay? So, you guys need a money, right? I can help you guys out. - How the fuck are you going to help us? You already fucked this whole thing up for us, man. Listen. I'm fucking gangster, okay? - Jesus fucking Christ. It's not a fucking video game, dude. - What do you guys need the money for? It's for your dog? Long fucking story, alright? You won't fucking tell him, fuck you. Fuck you, man. - So, you guys got any plan B, backup plan? You should always have plan B. - I had a fuckin' plan, but you didn't want to hear it. It's only ... Listen to me. - Give us a second. Give us a second. Only fucking way, man. I'm telling you. Shit fuck. What the fuck is wrong with you, alright? Look at this fucking mess you got us into. - You're fucking right, I don't know what to do. Look, this road, there's about 20 of 'em, alright? We can get $2,000-$3,000 a pop from each one. That's our only hope at this point. We don't have any other fuckin' options. You know? So, what the heck is he gonna do? - He's gonna drive. - So, I'm the driver. That's what I'm talking about. - This looks pretty fuckin' cool, doesn't it? - Fuckin' creepy. Damn, these fuckin' feel so good. - Why don't we just stick to what we know, man. Gas stations. - We can't do Gas City, they don't have enough money. Fuck yeah! - Actually-- What? You don't need a gun. What the fuck you talking about? You're a driver. Matt, you cool? - Oh, yeah. I'm just tired, man. - Yo, where the hell you goin'? I'm goin' to get some smokes. - Okay. Yes, sir. What do you mean? We're about to do this, man. Dude, chill the fuck out! It'll take me five minutes. Alright. No crazy shit this time. - No crazy shit. - We're all good, just don't screw this up, man. - Fuck you, Simon. Are you my fuckin' mom, keepin' tags on me? We don't have any fuckin' options right now. This is the only way to get the amount we need. This is it. Uh, maybe we should just, just take the money and just get the fuck outta town. We gotta get the fuckin' money first. And once we get the money, we're gonna go straight to fuckin' Butch. Where is he? - I don't know. - Okay, fuck it. Alright, okay, fine, fine, pussy. Alright, you guys, it's gonna work, okay? Simon, forget about your dog, okay? I can cook some dog for you. You gotta leave the dog, man. Yeah, I don't give a shit about dog. You know, we eat dog in China. For me it's a chicken. The dog's the only fucking good thing in my life. That's just because you don't have money. Once you have money, you're gonna know you have more things. Just let it go. Are we gonna do this? Fuck! I know you were on the drop, but I really, I think the only option is to do this, and get outta town. So, do you wanna die? Or you wanna have a dog? I thing we just gotta take the money and go. Yeah. Fucking A, man! Calm down, man, calm down. Fuckin' afterschool special. I'm about to fuckin' kill you, dude. I'm gonna kill everyone. I'm gonna turn into a fuckin', a nuclear missile, and just obliterate the fuckin' world. I'm just, I'm gonna destroy the universe, killing you, and destroying your carcass, in vicious fuckin' hell. God dammit, dude. Put the fuckin' gun, dude tell him to put the fuckin' gun down! We're gonna get the money tonight, and we're gonna get outta town, and you're gonna forget about your dog, and we're never comin' back. That's the only solution. Jesus Christ, I go to get a pack of cigarettes, and you two fuckers turn into psychopaths? I'm sorry man, you have to let it go. You're all sweaty. - I've been workin' out, man. How the fuck you think I look like this? Put the fucking gun back. Fuckin' lookin'. Drivin' a fuckin' parkin' lot. See anything? That one. No, we won't do that. Why not? It's a fuckin' Japanese car, man. I don't wanna do that. It supports terrorism. What the fuck are you talking about? Shut up, Louis, you're just racist, man. That one. Here, yeah, the German car. I'm not doin' a German car, dude! Stop the fucking car, stop the fucking car. You ready, Louis? Fuck yeah, I'm gangster! Shut the fuck up with the gangster bullshit. - Hey, you ready? - Yeah, let's do this. - Louis, keep the car running. Matt, get the fuckin' money, I'll get the fuckin' door, alright? I got you. Alright, mother fucker! Put the money in the fuckin' bag, man! Pull that drawer open. Don't look at me, get on the ground. On the fucking ground. Hurry the fuck up! Hurry the fuck up! Guard the fucking door, man! Bitch, you got about five fucking seconds, I'm a blow your head off all over the fuckin' wall! Hurry the fuck up! - Don't fuckin' look at me! Don't fuckin' look at me! Hurry up! Faster, faster! What the fuck is goin' on? - I'm sorry. Come on, what the fuck, no passengers, man! - I can't fuckin' do this, man. I can't fuckin' do this, alright? - What the fuck? - I'm freaking out, man! Like, you're gonna have to fuckin' take over, alright? I'll watch the door, but I can't fuckin' do this! - Better not fuck this up, mother fucker! You hear me? Don't fuck this up! Ah so! Ah yeah! Come on! I'm on a fuckin' grenade! Hey, nobody move, nobody move! Grab the fuckin' bag, and put the money in the fuckin' bag right now! Hurry the fuck up, man! Papa loves you. Everything, in the bag. Hurry it up! - Drive. Drive fast, mother fucker! What are you doing? I can't, okay, this is a residential zone. It's a fuckin' highway! Get the fuck outta here, man! God dammit, Louis, come on, man! - Shit. Look at this, man, look at this. We fuckin' did it, man. I told you, man, we fuckin' did this. Ah, shit. Oh, here's your cut, you little fucker. Ugh, shit. We fuckin' did it, man. Oh ... Ugh, what a fuckin' night. Oh, what a night. Hey, I don't know what the fuck got into me earlier. I was just freaking out, dude. It is not like me, man. I'm sorry, I just ... This whole thing, just-- - Hey, Matt. Finish it, alright? Hello? Hey, Matt. Blill. Hey man, you gotta get everything outta the house. Where are you, man? I'm gettin' the fuck outta town. I'm in the airport. Fuck, that girl was hot, god damn! That ass, I'm gonna take a picture and send it to you, buddy. Hold on. Shit. Would it kill them to have some English around here? Where's the dog, man? What? Where the fuck is Amy? Who the fuck is Amy? The dog you fucking stole from us, man. Where's she at? Dog, what fucking dog, man? - The god damn dog you stole, dude! Where the fuck is she? What the fuck is wrong with you, man? A fucking dog right now? You need to think about your own cock, Jesus Christ! - God dammit, shit! Fuck! Fuck my ass, I gotta go, man, okay? I'm doin' this as a friend. - Where is he? Who, Butch? Are you serious? - Yeah. He's probably fuckin' some whore, I don't know. Trust me, you don't wanna know a god damn thing about that guy. - I need to fuckin' know, man. Look, you wanna make some more money? I'm thinkin' something a little different. You know how to shoot that gun? I'm beautiful, because I exist. I am one with the world. I am whole and complete. You know, being a spy is tough work. You gotta give up your personal life, your financial life, your social life. You know what you have to do? You gotta be the most dangerous, danger-loving person in the world. You have to jump off this building, every single day. This is what I do. Can you jump off this building? I can. I do that every day, to get my body ready. Every morning, I-- - Amy? Amy! It is you. That is you, girl. Ah, you okay? Are you okay? Ah, Amy. You okay. ♫ So baby you're hum-a-long moves ♫ Shakes back ♫ - Fuck, it's all I could handle.
