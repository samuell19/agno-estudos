Thanks I left the manager and we have a job .I see I knew you'd come sooner or later Wishing to discuss what happened at Westview The events of the series (Wanda & Vision) I made mistakes and hurt people But you set things right And I wasn't there to help. I didn't come to talk about what happened at Westview Why didn't you come then? - We want to help you. Help me with what? What do you know about the "multiverse"? The multiverse? Vision had his theories. I think it's real .and dangerous as well Well, he was right about both. We found a girl who can travel across universes But someone is after her Who is stalking her? - Almost demon. He wants to seize her abilities We took her to Camertag and we have our defenses But we can use a member of the Avengers There are members of the "Avengers" other than me But the choice is between crossbows Or a few crime-fighting insects .or the most powerful magic wizard on the surface of the planet It's an easy choice Come to Camartage This will bring you back .on lunch boxes as a superhero What if we brought America here? here? Yes, I know what it is. to be alone They chase after you for abilities you didn't even want to And I can protect her You didn't even tell me her name, did you? - .correct - No, I didn't tell you her name. The matter of the spell was easy. But lying... was a little hard. Darkhold's book! You know the book! I know it's the book of the damned And it spoils everything and anyone who touches it Hey, what did he do to you? Darkhold's book only showed me the truth .everything I ever lost... can be mine again. What do you want from America? What do you want out of the "multiverse"? I will leave this reality And I go to another reality where I am with my two children Your kids aren't real, Wanda! By magic you created them! This is what literally every mother does. If I knew… that there is a world You would be happy in it, would you not want to go to it? I'm really happy I know better than anyone what self-deception is like What you're doing is violating all the laws of nature If that girl takes away her powers, she won't survive. I take no pleasure in hurting anyone, Stephen But she's not a child! She is a supernatural being have abilities He was able to move from one universe to another ...its sacrifice It will be for the public good You can say goodbye to appearing on lunchboxes as a heroine Because this is the justification our evil enemies use. Is this the excuse you used? When you gave the Time Stone to Thanos? This was in the war and I did what I had to do. When you break the rules, you become a champion But when I disagree with her, I become the enemy! Where is the justice in this? What will happen now? You will return to Camartage And preparing to deliver (America Chavez) by sunset .safely …Then You'll never see me again And if we don't deliver it to you? ...then Wanda won't come to pick her up It's the "Red Witch." "Red Witch" Wanda no longer exists I got the book "Darkhold". And the book took possession of it .The "Red Witch" has a twisted charm She can alter reality if she wants She plans to either rule the universe or destroy it all She took over an entire town .using her mental ability ...(If you acquire the capabilities of (America) It will destroy all the 'Multiverse' So who did you go to for help I told her exactly where I am, who wants to kill me? .Yes Immediately ask the teachers and students to come Kamartaj must now become a fortress. !Wow It's the biggest gathering I've ever seen It's an honor to face death next to you again .the honor is mine We will do whatever the Supreme Wizard asks of us Look at the old habits Choose your wisest words. I fear that perhaps The fate of the "multiverse" depends on it .Concept Your words don't put pressure on me or anything All this for a girl you met yesterday?! Wanda, your anger is justified. I had to make terrible sacrifices I blew off the head of the man I love And what did you gain? nothing Don't talk to me about sacrifice, Stephen Strange If you give me what I want I will send you to a universe where you will be with Christine All Kamartag guards will stand up to you Take your positions! Go! They didn't come to kill you. You have no idea how rational I've been acting. .Yes The Book of the Damned and you call yourself a witch and summon a creature to kill I wouldn't call this being rational, frankly. Send those creatures to take them down Instead of coming by myself, it was a mercy from me Despite your hypocrisy and insult, I beg you to get out of my way and be safe I'm running out of patience But I hope you will understand my actions …that so far ...what's about to happen It is only that I act rationally. Hold on! Hold on! .creative Support our shield! She's trying to control their minds. Magicians! Fortify your minds run away The shield is falling apart !release !Yes Take cover! They fired! Back off! !Come on !to retreat !Come on If you want a girl, you have to get over me first. .decent I'll get you out of here Wang, what happened?) Camartage collapsed Reflections! She uses reflexes! accompanied me I sacrificed all those lives To keep me away from my child You are the one who stole those lives You can't be allowed By navigating the “multiverse” I'm not a monster, Stephen. I am a mother Wanda, you don't have children! They don't exist! .but they exist In every universe other than this .I know that .because I dreamed of them .Every night I love my baby and our lives together three hundred fifty 00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:16,000 .I love you mom …Every night I have the same dream ...and every morning I wake up to find I'm living the same nightmare What will you do when you reach them? What will happen to your other copy? What will happen to their real mother? Are you fine? You saved me! .I hope so How did you not vomit? - It's not my first weird ride, girl. ...So, this is New York in the Universes She has vomited !Die stop! .Yes. damaged a lot We'll fix you! Well, America You have to open a gate and take us back there at once. I don't know how to do it! But you just did it! I didn't do it on purpose! Wang's there with Wanda, and I'm his only hope. - I can't control my abilities! ...you have to control it somehow, even me - What about your version of this universe? Perhaps she can control her abilities I do not exist in this universe What? - I don't exist in any universe. How can you be sure of that? - Because I searched. And because I never dreamed If you don't take me back there, There is no way for me to face Wanda What about the book "Vishanti"? - what about him? - According to your other version, he can deter those who follow me Yes, blessed is my other copy. But he's not here, right? I don't know where it is ...so this is a copy ...we have to go and find .on my other version !Die Cars are running and the lights are red? - ...the first rule for navigating the "multiverse" - You don't know anything. .Okay The pedestrian signal is red So what's the second rule? USA)?) USA)?) ...the second rule Find the food It's mostly pizza .pizza balls How did you pay for it? - It was free. It's free in several universes, in fact. It's strange that you have to pay for it !you! You didn't pay for it !Die Maybe it's not free here. It has to be paid to Papa's pizza. ...Calm down, Mr. Papa, she's just a girl Think about yourself, Dr. Strange Where did you get that scarf from anyway? .looks luxurious It's not a scarf, it's a cloak. I advise you to leave it I took that old suit From the String Museum, right? The String Museum? - .Take it - Why not take some mustard? Come on, it won't last forever. Will the spell stop after a few minutes? It will stop after about 3 weeks In those universes we've been through, Were we paints in one of them? Yes, you wouldn't want to get stuck there. It's so hard to eat there. How many universes have you been to? I went to 72 universes 73 by the reckoning of this universe This... that's a lot! Memory Lane Rewatch your memories, now at a reduced price We remember, so you don't forget. (Memory Lane) It looks so luxurious. Did you have to remove another tumor? No, I was seeing the condition of the kidneys The one we planted last week …If I I brought you a simple present .congratulations what is this? Open it and watch This Christine It's absolutely amazing, thank you We don't have time for this. Memory Lane Rewatch your memories, now at a reduced price We remember, so you don't forget. where is this place? home .my mom My dear mothers !no I was right, this is just a waste of time. Wait girl! ...it was the first time you opened a gate and .Did not matter Doesn't it matter that you lost your mother? I didn't lose them, I killed them No, you didn't kill them. Don't even think about this I opened a gate with abilities I couldn't control and sent them to a random universe that is impossible to reach Listen, if your mother is like their daughter, you will survive. I'm sure you'll meet them again one day Your words are not bad. .Thanks That woman we saw in your memory It was Christine, right? Yes, it was Christine. How do you know her? .from your other version .We'll be together No, you don't talk anymore. I ruined your relationship. .Of course - Did you ruin your relationship with Kristen? Yes, I think I spoiled it. Why? .It's complicated More complicated than a witch hunt for you Across the "multiverse"? Yes, it's more complicated. Doctor Strange gave his life to defeat Thanos. We are deeply grateful to Earth's greatest heroes He gave his life to defeat Thanos? - I see, but we're not sure about that. If your other copy dies, Who presides over the “Holy of Holies”? !Oh my God do you know him? - Yeah, it's Mordo. He's the first one to let me into Kamartage !Wonderful - Then he turned around and devoted his life to trying to kill me. My joy! I always thought this day would come. truly? - .Yes - Because you always doubted that this day would come .Brother .Okay .Enter ...and tell me everything .about being The light is red, let's go! You look so strong it seems Two travelers through the "multiverse." But thank you, Chavez To get Dr. Strange to safety Our distance from being does not necessarily mean our safety Wanda has the ability to summon and harness .Demons and monsters to attack (America) in other universes She has Darkhold, then? You know about the book "Darkhold"? - Yeah, we have one in our universe. I brought him here in the Holy of Holies It is impossible to risk falling into a weapon this dangerous .in the wrong hands .you are right If the Darkhold book, being like ours, I'm afraid she can do so much more From summoning monsters to chase you here. what do you mean? There is a spell between these pages. The soul is surprised It defiles reality itself .Takes you through dreams A magician who travels through dreams is able to transmit consciousness From one universe to another universe .possessing his other version's body Then he takes control of this possessed body He chases after his enemy from a distance Possession does not permanently affect reality But once you move them through dreams .They might cause tremendous damage to the universe they invade. So, perhaps you will never face a demon But perhaps you will face the "Red Witch." And why are you doing this from the start? .because she was acting rationally, she said What do you know about the book "Vishanti"? The opposite of Darkhold's book He can give the magician the strength he needs .to eliminate his enemy I want you to help me find it Sorry, Stephen But I hope you will understand of all people that the problem ...not in threat (Wanda Maximoff) to her reality The problem is with you and her What did you put in that tea? You son of a bitch! I'm doing what you would do if you were me. !it's coming Can we have more ice cream? .Please - .Please - .I don't like being evil Do you know who was the best? - from? - "Tigers 2003" …Stop Mom?

I want spells from the Darkhold book You are the "Supreme Wizard", so tell me what you know You'll have to kill me, witch. I won't kill you I will kill them Please, Wanda .Darkhold's book was just a copy Copy"?" I can take you to a mountain The spells you are looking for are carved on its walls. It was translated and placed in the book "Darkhold". Mount Wintergord "Winterguard" No one survived this journey. .maybe we will be the exception This universe sucks! abaya? !you Lab scientist! Where in heaven are we? I don't know who you are or what you are trying to do here These situations don't usually pay off ...for something good for scientists Christine?) Hello Stephen .Welcome Hello, Miss Chavez To answer your question, You are in a heavily guarded research facility You and your gown are being examined check up"?" Yes, you two are visitors from another universe. Your magnetic indicators may be radioactive They may carry diseases for which we have no cure That's why you are locked in those cages Made of polycarbonate So, thank you for setting this up Yes, I developed it using Sense of Essence One of Steven 939's magical items Stephen 939? Is this the automated version of me?) Our being number 939 We determined that your number is 616 Surely you know a lot about the "multiverse". Since you are now numbering the universes .correct I know a lot I'm a senior scientist at the Baxter facility I specialize in "multiverse" research So how did you end up working here? Whoever this place was originally! I volunteered .at your funeral Thank you for coming. Your injuries... are similar but not identical .It is amazing "% Match: 98.6" What was our relationship to each other in this universe? We've never been able to figure this out. .Yes This is something in common in my being and being. Christine?) You have to get us out of here Everyone is in real danger ...Listen, I know you don't know me I don't want to know you Whatever I am to you in your universe, it doesn't matter why not? Because you're dangerous, Stephen There is someone from my world who wants this girl. And you will destroy this universe one atom after another Until she achieves her goal So I don't care …” If you are one of the “Avengers” or “Shield We are neither of this nor that Which team are you from then? Hydra? The Illuminati... will meet you now. Matno... what? Don't let anyone hurt the girl .everything will be alright Couldn't you open the gate near him? This is the limit of my magical abilities Not supposed to be a magician of the spiritual arts Stepping foot on forbidden ground like this …He was the first demon His dark magic is etched on the walls of this tomb Certain spells were translated later It was placed in the book "Darkhold". We totally don't know what savage spirits lurk here It's subject to me! This is not a cemetery! It's a throne (Stephen Strange) You are now before the Illuminati I'm Carl Mordo, the Supreme Wizard (Carl) This is Captain Carter, the first Avengers Blackagar Boltgen, Targin Mist. And the king of Inhumans = non-humans .(Blakagar Boltgen) .Hi man Captain Marvel, Defender of the Universes. And the smartest man on earth, Reed Richards From the Fantastic Four = The Magnificent Four Hello Stephen Fantastic Four? Are you the pioneers of the sixties? Excuse me. Is this a joke? There's a man over there who puts a fork over his head So yeah, a little. Be thankful that Black Bolt isn't talking to you Why? Does his breath smell foul? String, that's more cocky than ours. I'm just alive, unlike him .Temporarily Coming here, Stephen .destabilizes reality The more you leave a trail, The possibility of a raid increased raid"?" - Cursed raid. When the boundaries of Konin intersect, They collide .which leads to the destruction of one or two universes completely Your version in this universe of the "Illuminati" To make difficult decisions when others are unable to take them We met today to determine how to behave with you and the girl So, before we vote, If you have something serious to say, Now is the time I have something to say Which raid are you worried about? Do you really think I'm more of a threat than the Red Witch? We can handle a witch If you decide to navigate through dreams No, you can't. Unless you give me the book "Vishanti." We appreciate your concern, Stephen But our fear is not of the Red Witch From our experience It turns out that the biggest threat to the "multiverse" is He's Dr. Strange Hey! Dr. Strange, being you? Earth's greatest heroes Who sacrificed himself to defeat Thanos? We should tell him the truth. ...the last member of our clan Professor Charles Exavier what truth? Strange didn't die that way She wonders what's going on now .no And you've already accepted it , but my real question is When you could force (America) to send you ...to which world do you want Why did you want to seize her abilities? .in a way that will lead to her death For the sake of Billy and Tommy. to protect them What if I get sick? In the infinite universes, there is a cure for every ill A solution to every problem I won't let them lose them again. Try as much as you want But you can't control everything. I can .Look around you This is engraved in stone I am destined to rule everything But that's not what I want. I only want my baby. And the price of a little girl's life? There is no calmness in such a matter. Even if you risk being with the one you love There are universes in which you are together. Is this not enough for you? .not enough for me Strange didn't die defeating Thanos We were at war And the rest of us tried to unite to stop Thanos As for Stephen, he always chose to fight alone. Use the Darkhold book And he started walking through dreams I hope to find salvation in the "multiverse." And guess, guess? Didn't find it But he kept doing it anyway. And when we all faced it, He admitted that he was dreaming. And then I said, "Things got out of hand She never told us the details of what happened Except you didn't intentionally cause a raid. You, our friend, caused the destruction of another universe. Everyone in that reality died .to the last of them (Steven) used Darkhold's book To find the book "Vishante." A weapon we previously used together to defeat Thanos But one last threat remains I will miss you my friend .I am ready I'm so sorry Did you tell Kristen? .Yes The statue... What about the statue? You built a statue of him! The world needs heroes We made a difficult decision Because we knew what String Kon could do. And perhaps what Dr. Strange could do? There is a building intrusion This is clear to the blind, genius View surveillance footage She's heading towards the baby. Watch him. We'll take care of it Stephen, you have to escape from this room. America must guide Chavez What do you say for heaven's sake? Save the girl and get the book "Vishanti". Do you keep the book here? Yes, you have to get to it Charles! We can't trust him) .I think we can trust him Someone stumbled and lost the way .does not necessarily mean forever astray We'll see your real metal And which version of Dr. Strange are you? .Thanks 'security breach' Closing procedures are in progress. .everyone out Get out! It's Wanda! Activate manual control Hurry up, it's coming! !no Wanda, stop it possessed an innocent woman, But you can still do the right thing. Set her free .Please I have children and I understand your pain Is their mother still alive? .Yes .good There will be someone who loves them to raise them .(Wanda) Black Bolt can destroy you. With one whisper from his mouth Which mouth? Take me to Vishanti's book so we can face it together. You are not in a position to issue orders My vote will determine the outcome of this matter. Haven't you had enough? I can do this all day long Get out of my universe for heaven's sake! .They won't come back And now you have voted to kill your friends I used to bother you before. You know you hate me where I came from I'm sure you secretly hated me here, brother. You must have been feeling very jealous, you know why? I bet you were so happy knowing I got lost I think you gave me the Darkhold yourself. You don't know anything about this universe. I know killing Stephen Strange was your ticket To singly "Holy of Holies" And to become the "Supreme Wizard" And she joins the group of clowns called "the Illuminati." …I am ready .to cast my vote .right Now I'm starting to understand now Why don't you like Mordo in your universe? .refuses to respond Back off! !It is enough Wanda Maximov?) Your mind is being held by a copy of you hold my hand Maybe if I could get you out of the wreckage The spell will be broken. are you OK? Are you fine? are you OK? .Welcome I fixed the abaya .Thanks - .decent - (Exavier) said I could take the Vishanti book Can you take us to him? How am I supposed to trust you? - .You are right - I'm sorry for what he did, but believe me, .Vishanti's book is the only way Yes, your way You look like Steven being a lot now. He was holding a protection knife Then this serenity turned to slaughter the one who protects Stephen. That's different. .believe me It doesn't matter how the rest of the copies are. It's not like them. .smart girl .GIVE me your hand Don't make me regret this. .you will not regret Can we go now? - follow me Where does this tunnel lead? - Down the river. Go! Watch out, armored gate. where did you go? .I want you Wanda, this universe, if you can hear me. Hold your breath .Come on Did this kill her? - It'll just delay her a little bit. The books are here, but only Stephen opened them. It is certain that what opens it is something that no one else knows about Steven)?) .Come on .(Steven) .Yes .Thanks .Excuse me !(open Sesame .come on girl .you are hers .We can do it .Yes are you OK? - .Yes - This is missed junction The space between universes OK, book. Give me what I need !My baby This is me This is not what your children will want They will never know. They might not know, but you will. !no miserable It seems that the reality of this universe is collapsing on itself .Yes Konin collision .Come on There are no copies from (America). Where will we go then? We'll see if it's still there Holy of Holies in this universe or not. There might be a different version of me. And this is our best chance to come back to it Now I'm starting to understand why you were so worried Who is the subject of this raid? ...whatever happens The magician of this universe He puts an outstanding effort in confronting him I'll tell him you said that. Stop your shop How did I get here? .Accidentally who are you? What are you? I'm just one of us From the "multiverse"? .This is correct .Prove That ...we had a sister .(Without a) …It She died when we were young How do? …We were ...we play over a frozen lake and I fell in it through the cracked ice. I couldn't save her It seems right. But we don't talk about this, right? .correct I suppose your reality wasn't always like this. ...I even doubted you'd come with a copy like yourself Until? .so i lost in front of whom? what do you want? I just want to go home Yes, believe me. I've been trying to leave this place for a long time. Darkhold's book! Guarding Darkhold's book in this universe? .Yes .for good reason First of all, I can make use of it ...you can help me communicate with Connie - .beware - The book "Darkhold" is a cause for heavy losses I don't mean to be inconsiderate But what path remains that carries less losses than this? The consequences of losses are not limited to his reality only Rather, it extends to the reader I apologize for not being able to save your universe But maybe you can help save Kony. Are you happy, Stephen? What did you say? Are you happy, Stephen? ...it's the question that She (Christine Palmer) offered it to me at her wedding And I said, "Of course I'm happy I am a magician with the power of a goddess What mortal would not be happy with this? And then I went back to that damned haunted house and sat down I wondered why I lied to her I didn't mean for any of this to happen I've always looked for a universe where things are different Be with me on it (Christine) and I'll be really happy But I never found it. I only found more of us. So I did these Stephen copies Have you ever had that dream? The one in which you fall as if you were thrown from a high place? .Maybe you did it The book "Darkhold" is a cause for heavy losses .Okay That's all the more reason to hand it to me and you'll rest. Here's the deal I'll let you use Darkhold's book If you give me (Christine) Konk Yes, but I don't think she'll agree to that. no? Just like you thought. Hold on, I'm coming Why use the book "Darkhold"? Will you travel through dreams? It's more than just moving between dreams You are all the same, String .Know Then you were right We are all the same But right now that girl needs me And I can't do any of this without your help.
