- When I was about eight years old my parents wanted to go to Florida, and I'm goin', "Oh boy, goin' to Florida," they're sayin', "No, you're not goin' to Florida, "you're gonna go to camp this summer." And I go, "Okay," and when the brochure came in the mail it looked pretty good, you know, it had guys in canoes, there was a lake there, and there was horseback riding, archery, you know, bows and arrows, you like bow and arrows, right, Billy? Yeah, I like bow and arrows. Rifle range, get to shoot the guns. Arts and crafts. Being there with the guys your age, you know. So, of course we had to get the big trunk, shop for that and put your name in your socks and your underwear, and all your clothes, your little polo shirts, your bathing suits, all that camp stuff, your little supplies, your soap, your towels. And this was nice, havin' a foot locker, you know, you're in the army now kinda thing, but for summer camp, never been to summer camp. So of course they drive up there somewhere, Pennsylvania, and we're from New Jersey, so it's a couple hours, two, three hours, I don't know, driving someplace that was a Catholic deal. I guess the brothers or the monks of some order were babysittin' all these, and counseling these camp kids. And on the other side of the lake was the girl's side of the lake. I guess they stayed over there. But I didn't know anything drivin' up there, my new little trunk, lookin' at the scenery. Pull up off this road that's like a dirt road, and it gets smaller and smaller, hillier, it's goin' up and down, 'til we finally get to this clearing, it must have been the size of a baseball field or something, and all around this big opening area were these little cabins stuck into the side of the hill, and right there when we pull in with the station wagon, parents pull... My foot locker out of the trunk of the car and I get out of the car and we start walkin' over towards this crowd of people, you know, it was like all these kids, a big circle of kids, and they were like, three, three thick, and in the middle of this circle, I couldn't see what it was, all I could see was all this dust goin' up in the air, and then all of a sudden it just stopped, all the yelling and everything and screaming just stopped, and then it opened up into like a horseshoe kinda thing, and they all said, "Here's the "new kid, another new kid." That was me, and one kid grabs me and just throws me in the middle, I don't know who's in there, but some guy named Spike or Duke or something, he had the gloves on, and I could always remember, he had like this little snot comin' out of his nose, with dirt all around his mouth, and his eyes were all sweaty, and his tongue was hangin' out of his mouth, and he was just beatin' the shit out of any new kid that came in, and that's what I got right away. Boom, boom, boom, and they were all yelling and screaming, and where are my parents, ther've already gone, they just left me with my trunk and took off. [intense music] Hello! Hello? What're you doin', somethin' wrong with the creek? Hey, you! - [Yahn] Yeah? - [Willie] What're you doin'? - What, is this your creek? - Yeah, yeah, do you work with the city or something? - You own this whole creek? - Well, up to this point and under here, yeah. - All right. I'm just checkin' it out. You might got gold, I dunno. - Yeah, okay. Whatever. Don't stay too long. What're you doin'? Where you goin? Now you're on my property. Now you're on my property. Are you with the city or somethin'? Huh? - [Yahn] No. - Hey, okay, put that shovel down, huh? You're on my property now, and I don't want anybody talkin' to me on my property with somethin' in their hands. Okay, could be a machete for all I know. What're you doin' here? Huh? - I really need to, I need to use your bathroom. - You wanna use my bathroom? Okay, I got an idea, I know what that's like to use the bathroom. You can use my bathroom, but you're gonna have to do me a favor, okay? Can you take about 15 minutes to help me out? - Maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Maybe you wanna use the bathroom. Gonna have to take those shoes off, you're all wet. I got new carpeting in here, and I don't want it all messed up. So all of a sudden, I guess the monks or the brothers come, and the counselors, the older guys, they come and break this whole little scene up and say, "I guess "everybody's here, so everybody, we're gonna "do the buddy system, everybody pair up "in size," you know, so I was one of the smaller kids, younger kids, and I was paired up with some guy named Theodore Slezak. They called him Fleabag after a couple weeks. So he was my buddy, he was supposed to be my bunk mate, and we all line up. Smallest to the tallest. Might've been a hundred people. And he says, "We're all gonna go down to "the mess hall now for lunch." And all of a sudden these guys come up with shovels, you know, big spade shovels, and they had these boulders in their other hand, they were just, there was one in the front, one guy in the middle with the shovel and a rock, and another guy at the end back by me. Well, we start goin' down this narrow path towards the lake, and we're windin' through this wooded area, in this high grass area, and all of a sudden, [screeches] it just stopped, the whole line stopped, and then you hear this thump, clank clank clank, you know, and then the line would move along, and by the time we got past where that noise was, I looked down and go, "What is that," it's like a big, you know, pile of rocks on top of this snake. It was a snake they had killed. I guess this is the procedure they have everywhere you go, buddy system, if a snake happens to be in the path, you kill it. Hold up. Here, one more thing. Here, put this down. [clears throat] Okay. Here, now I just want you to shoot one more thing, is that okay? - Um, what-- - I think, you know, about a half hour more, can you stay? - You said 15 minutes. - I know, can you do it, though? No more than an hour. - An hour? Like, you know, I got-- - How 'bout, could you come back again? I need some help, could you help me again? Would you? - I could help you, I could come back again. - Yeah, what, Tuesday, Wednesday? - Um, Tuesday or Wednesday. - Okay, you got my, I gave you the phone number downstairs? - No, no. - I'll give it to you, come on, I'll walk you out of here. Okay, if you come back I'll be ready for you, just let me know, I just need about an hour of your time, maybe two. Maybe, I might... - [Yahn] Have you died today yet? Have you died today yet? Have you died today yet? [doorbell buzzing] Oh, come on in. How's it goin'? - All right, nine bucks. - Nine bucks. Hey, have you died today yet? - What? - I'm writin' this screenplay, and there's this line that just, I don't know if it's working for me, but I can't tell 'cause I'm never good at reading this stuff, could you, could you, could you just say that line for me, could you say-- - Have you died for me-- - Not have you died for me, have you died today yet? Take a second, just kind of close your eyes and then open them and say it to me. - Have you died today yet? - Okay, little more angrier. - Have you died today yet? - All right, how 'bout, that's good, how 'bout sad? - Have you died today yet? Was it cool? - Yeah, no, no, no, that's good, that's good. How 'bout... - What're you writin' it for? - It's just a movie, just a movie, it's just a screenplay that I'm workin' on, and it's just still in the early stages, I don't know. But thanks, thanks for helpin' me out, and thanks for everything. - Yeah, take it easy, thanks for the tip, man. [funky music] - You know, the few times that it's been working for me is when I realize that art is not fiction. Like, there's nothing fictional about art for me. - Being human is the hardest thing to do. Being honest and truthful with yourself, for other people, to other people, it's the hardest thing to do. [funky music] I grew up down on 55th Street. - [Shouting Woman] Huh? - I grew up down on 55th Street. [woman shouts] Catskills. They taught me how to dance like that! [soft guitar music] ♪ I will face the day ♪ I will face the day ♪ I will face the day ♪ Yes, I will face the day ♪ I will face the day ♪ Yes, I will face the day ♪ I want the world to win ♪ I want the world ♪ To win ♪ I want the world to win ♪ I want the world ♪ To win ♪ I want the world to win ♪ I want the world to win - I do remember one distinct time when I died. I was, um, in this house in Lake Tahoe about two years ago, it was during the summer, and Lake Tahoe was just surrounded by forest, it's this house in the forest, and I'd kinda gone there for about a week to just... Be alone, and I stopped eating... For a while, I was just drinking water and some juice and stuff, and watching a lot of movies. Watching a lot of movies, and I rented one movie which ended up just being perfect for me at that moment because I'd been spending a lot of time deciding what was... What I was doing in terms of how I wanted to live my life, and I was really stressing very hard for a very long time to live a very pious, you know, righteous life, doing everything that was, you know, possible, that was right that a human could do. And I saw this movie that I... It was one man's struggle between trying to live the most spiritual life possible and being a human. And, 'cause the two were just so... So opposite. The human wanted to love and be hurt, and to live every day just enjoying a family, and a woman, and the spiritual side wanted to... You know, do what was right for the greater majority of people, which meant a lot of cleaning the body, and anyway, the movie just hit me hard. It was like an afternoon, it just hit me hard, and I remember weeping through the last half hour of the movie, just uncontrollably, and... And it finished, and I was just still, just crying, 'cause I realized I'd spent the last year trying to live something that wasn't me, maybe, I don't know. I wasn't, I hadn't attained whatever it was I obviously had wanted, and so I sat down, and I realized well, now's a good time for a tarot card reading or something, so I sat down and I started throwin' out some cards, and I don't remember exactly all the cards that I got, but one of them was this one, was the Hangman, which is an upside down, you know, crucifixion, and it's the 12th card to the tarot, which correlates with my birthday, which is on the 12th day of the month, and it's a card that I pretty much... Always get, every time I do a tarot reading, whether it's three cards or 10 cards or whatever, I always get this card. And there was other cards, like the Sun, and another one was Sorrow, another one was... I don't even remember, but whatever, like, all the cards fell into place, and it was this exact mirror of who I was, and so I started weeping again, uncontrollably, like, something was happening, like something was... Either wrapping itself, wrapping its arms around me or tearing me apart. And I remember it was, like, the same feeling all at once, and so, and also, I had this friend who'd given me these little wooden dolls, those little yogi dolls that are like these guys goin', in a little ball, and I remember like, and I had placed it on this, like, you know, fireplace, facing near me, I guess, and I remember when I did this tarot card I was just sitting there weeping, and I'm in this little ball, and I look up and it's just, you know, and it's just this mirror of me right there, which felt like some sort of validation, too, so... I kinda regrouped for a minute and I went outside, out into the backyard, which was all trees, and I started walking around, and I was walking around all these trees, just kinda, I don't know, I wasn't even thinking, I wasn't even like, I was just so drained at this point, and from like, I don't know, 20 feet away, this big pine cone just dropped out of the sky. And then I looked at it, and I looked up at the tree above me and I thought, "I want a pinecone, I want a pinecone," so I looked up, and I just kinda held my arm up to this tree, and I sat there, and I said, "I want this pinecone, "I want this pinecone," and if it got to the point where I was thinking, "Well, it's not "gonna happen," I didn't even, I would just squelch it, and I just said, "No, I am staying "here until I get a pinecone," and I sat there for at least 45, I stood there for about 45 seconds waiting for a pinecone, and all of a sudden I hear this little [cracking noise] little snap in the trees, and I'm like, "Oh my God," like I'm shaking all of a sudden, and like, some branch kind of breaks off and starts, you know, all this little debris starts comin' in, and this little tiny like, this twig, maybe about this long or whatever, starts sailing down, and seriously, like maybe I move my hand like, two inches, and it drops into my hand, and I pull it down, and it's this little twig, but it's got this little, almost like a bouquet of baby pinecones, little rosebud pinecones. And... It wasn't even, didn't need to think about it, it was just like, "Yeah, I got the pinecones, "this is what I wanted," and it wasn't until I had just gotten rid of all of the shit, all of the shit that was in my head for the last year or so, you know, I had to really just purge it all, that I could go out into the forest and ask for what I deserved. What I wanted. And I got it. And I remember walking back into the house and opening up this book that I had. I think it was, I don't know, I think it was Finnegan's Wake, and I wrote in the back, like, you know, "If this is what it feels like "dying, then let me die every day," 'cause I really felt like I'd died that day. And I'll never forget that. And I really think it's important that people die. And that you... Get through that. And you learn something from it. 'Cause it can be the most beautiful thing that happens to you. - [Willie] I had a dream just like that. I didn't die or anything, it was just sorta like... You know, it was sorta like you wanted somethin', and that was their reality, and then you dream that it went somewhere, and it was actually there next day. [newspaper machine banging] [funky samba music] - [Voiceover] Love at first sight. Like, seeing somebody from afar, maybe not even ever talking to them, but like, boom, it's there, or, you know, maybe that's like a one night thing that has happened that just so consumed you that you had to think about it for the rest of your life. - All the time, all the time, too. - Or looks that you've seen. - You know it, you know it, you feel it, it's like magnet. - [Yahn] But it doesn't happen all the time, does that mean, like, what, once every three years, or is it like-- - No, I mean, maybe if I'm lucky, twice or three times in my whole life. - [Yahn] Wow. - I mean, I don't count just catching eyes with someone on the street as being-- - [Yahn] Yeah, I guess maybe that's what I'm, I'm thinking about, like, kind of that mystery of like, seeing someone and it's like, "Oh, why couldn't I just go back and like..." - There's no question that I see beautiful people and I'm immediately attracted to them, but love at first sight is-- - So maybe we're taking love too lightly. - It happens to my all the time, moment to moment, that's how I-- - Maybe it's a guy thing. - I think that's more of a little spark that's like, "Okay, should I make the choice "to go there," and then your body, or your mind, or something clicks in and it's like, "I'm not gonna make the choice," or "I am gonna make the choice." - Yeah, I went after it and it fell flat on its face in two weeks, and I never talked to that person again. - But is that love, or is that-- - I don't know, but you gotta, you see it and you gotta, like, you know, go after it and say, "Well, is this the real spark?" - [Muse] Was it love? - It was in the moment when we were, you know, I don't know, spending time together, high on mushrooms underneath the full moon, looking into each other's eyes. Our third eyes were, you know, [buzzing]. Electricity between, you know. I would do it again. - [Muse] So in hindsight, do you think it was love? - No. Yes! - This is what Yahn wears in the forest. You are homeless, you live in the hills. You guys live in, well, actually, you're not like, well, see, you used to have, you know, you're a city girl who's followed this homeless guy into the forest to live with him, and this scene is like, you've got, there's other homeless guys in the hills, too, you have friends, you have friends, you know, buddies, so you go off, and you wanna go hang out with these guys, and you've got a secret that you haven't really, or actually no, it's not a secret 'cause you told him once, but he doesn't know it's your birthday. - Cassandra, I'm goin' out to collect some wood. - I can't believe you forgot. - [Knox] What? - [Cassandra] Whatever. Go into the forest. - What? - I'm 25! It's my birthday! I just think it needs a little more, I mean, this is only the first draft, right? - [Yahn] The fifth draft. - First, fifth, same thing. - You're this, you're like this middle-aged guy who, his daughter, Cassandra, he found out she died a week earlier, and he had this really bad relationship with her, and she was into rock and roll and drugs and stuff like that, you know, and so she dies and then he had, you know, it was bad, but now we're seeing this pivotal moment. [muffled kissing noises] - [Voiceover] You would never guess they'd just had a wedding anniversary. Or they're married 60 years. - I've been married! - [Voiceover] And he's 90 years old. - Yeah, [mumbles]. - [Voiceover] [mumbles] and she's still alive, too. - Hey, come on up! Come on, hurry up! - [Voiceover] And she's still alive, too. - [Voiceover] Well, she was havin' the program on television, but he wasn't-- - Hey, Willie. - [Willie] Yahn, how you doin'? - Good, good, good. - [Willie] Who's this? - This is Cassandra. - [Willie] How you doin', Cassandra? Yahn, you didn't take the shoes off. You took yours off. Did you wipe your feet, at least? Okay, new carpeting, you understand? All right, look, I need you to shoot me doin' somethin' in front of this TV, okay? Okay, I got the camera, it's all set, it's already been balanced and everything, so I want you to stand over here and keep me in frame, sort of like from here to here, 'cause I'm gonna be right here. And you, Cassandra, you can sit right over here, be out of the way a little bit. Not a lot of chairs, right there. Okay. I gotta change my outfit here a little bit, hold on, have patience. [coughs] This is, like, my father's shirt. The same shirt, I think it even had a few of the same stains on it if you look closely. So anyway, you see this section here, I'm gonna be right here. As I play this, I'm not gonna, you gotta be quiet, 'cause you wanna hear what's on here, and I'm gonna animate to him, okay? You all focused? - [Yahn] Uh, yeah. - I'm gonna be here in frame, okay. [couple talking] Not yet. Hold on, watch this, watch this, stop. Little more, hold it, hold it, hold it, there! Uh oh. There it is. Here it is, here it is. Okay, he's gonna tell a joke. I look just real like him, now. - Yeah, I get that a bunch. And he's ridin' along, and then the bus stops, then a woman gets on the bus, and she goes up to the bus driver and she goes... And he turns around to her and he goes... And she goes... And then she faces him, and... And she goes... So, guy gets off at the station and says, "What the heck was all this about? "First she went like this, then she goes "like that to you, then she goes like this "and you go like that." He says, "She's a mute!" He says, "What do you mean, a mute," he says, "She can't talk, she uses sign language." "Well, what was all this about?" He says, "Well, she got on, she says, the fare five cents?, he says no its ten cents. He says, "are you goin' uptown?" She says, "no, I'm goin' downtown." He says, "Do you go past the milk farm," and she says, "No, we go down to the ballpark," and she went like this and said, "Shit, I'm on the wrong bus!" - Okay, that's it. Okay? [coughs] Did you get it good? - [Yahn] Um, I got it. I don't know if it was good, but you know. - [Willie] Okay, is it turned on or off? - [Yahn] I can, want me to turn it off? - Let me see if I can find it. Now, a little bit more, let's do somethin' else now, maybe. Let me find somethin' here. - [Yahn] Is your father still alive? - No, that's the whole deal, he's been dead for about 15 years, so I'm goin', we got a bunch of home movies, and this is just one little joke that he told, it's probably the only joke I have on record that he ever told, you know, on tape, so... - What is this for? - Just for my own family ideas, you know, just sharing. - [Yahn] This is the guy that I met-- - In the creek. - [Yahn] Yeah, couple weeks ago. - [Willie] Yeah, he was nice enough to help me out. You have to go somewhere or anything? Uh, yeah, I think we gotta, we do have to get goin' pretty soon. She's got... Band practice. - Band? - [Yahn] Well, it's not her band. - No? - [Yahn] I don't really know, so... - Well, I think, well that's done. - Do you have a bathroom? - You need a bathroom, now? Yeah. Yeah, there's, you can go out, here, I'll show you. - No, it's okay. - No? Okay. You don't have to go now? - It's out here? - Yeah, it's out and then to the left and then to the right. - [Yahn] Thanks, Willie. - Yeah, you got the number, you know, from last time. And yeah, you don't need money? You have time, though, right? [Cassandra screams] - What? The fuck was that? I'm not goin' in there. There might be a rat or somethin'. Or a snake. You leave the door open? - [Yahn] We gotta go, see you later! Bye! - So anyway, they get us all back, and now we're getting to see where we sleep, and it was these cabins that were right in the side of the hill. So the back of the hill would come up to the back of the window, the back window, and the double bunks were one bunk on the bottom, one bunk on the top, and I picked the top, you know, and I put my foot locker down on the bottom there, and then all of a sudden, you gotta go to the bathroom, so I'm thinkin', "I have to go to the bathroom. "Where do you go to the bathroom," they say, "Well, it's an outhouse." So the outhouse... Is like the same deal, it's like this little green path, and then there's the outhouse, so I walk there, me and a friend walk there, me and by Teddy Slezak, you know, Fleabag, we call him, down this path, and I was worried about snakes, so I had this stick with me. And then you open this door, it's an outhouse, and there's all these flies in there. It was just like a piece of wood with a hole in it, and it smelled terrible. So I said, "Geez, I'm not goin' in there." Plus, I was still afraid of snakes and stuff, so I would hold it. But after about three or four days, you can't hold it that much more, it starts to hurt, so I would probably just go in my pants for a while. And then change the pants and hide 'em outside behind the cabin. But pretty soon you'll run out of underwear, too, don't forget that, so then I stopped wearin' underwear. [sighs] - All right, so this is a scene between Cassandra and Knox. And you're Cassandra. It's the day of your birthday, but he's forgotten. If it says, just don't worry about the things that I had written, just read the, Cassandra is, she's living with Knox, who's in a band. - I can't believe you forgot. Whatever, whatever, just go to your gig. It's my birthday, I'm 25 years old! - I'm a jerk. But hey, I always forget things. My mom's birthday, I never remember that. I always forget. Oh yeah, I always forget. That's how artists are, baby. - I'm trying to balance some things right here that are kind of difficult to balance and I feel like you're not working with me, you're working against me. Do you know what I'm saying, I mean, why does it always seem like that? Like, you know, I mean, I'm... I'm not the great communicator, but you don't even make one little effort to communicate sometimes, you know, I mean, you just sit there with a blank look on your face and it's like, I'm supposed to... Fill in all the information that's not there, and I gotta admit, it leaves me kind of feeling, like, helpless. I mean, do you feel as helpless as I do? Wow, I think we actually just communicated right there. - It's my birthday! [cries] I'm 25 years old! - Listen... I'm really sorry, Cass. Jesus, what an asshole. I fucked up. I'm really sorry... Do you want me to cancel this gig tonight? - I'll go if you want me to. - How... How can you go and genuinely have a good time, and how can I, I don't know how I can make this up to you right now, I mean, we... Jesus. You know, I've been forgetting my mom's birthday all my life, I mean, I hope-- - I don't think that's supposed to make me feel better. [chuckles] - I'm serious! I'm just, I forget my own birthday, I do, seriously. If it wasn't for Matt reminding me about the gigs, I'd forget the gigs. - [laughs] Stop it, just go. - I'm serious! And I want you to come, okay? I want you to come, and I want you to be happy, and I want us to talk tomorrow, I mean, really talk, like remember a couple minutes ago when you said you felt helpless and I feel helpless, I mean, maybe that's a little starting point or something, anything, okay? - Okay, one thing. - What? - Can... Can I have a birthday kiss before we go? [kissing] All right, go, I'll get ready. - Okay, I'll be back. [sighing] - Could I... Could I have a birthday kiss? - I don't know about that. [laughs] - Was it too quick? - [Yahn] I mean-- - [Actress] Yeah, if she's, like, upset about it being her birthday and then all of a sudden she's like, "Oh yeah, you're an artist, all is forgiven, "I love you," you know. - Happy birthday. - What? - I got you a little necklace here. - Oh my God. - Just something to brighten up the day. - You remembered? [clearing throat] - [Knox] What's up? - Hey Knox, how's it goin'? Glad to see you're back. - Oh, this is so cool. - What'd I miss? - It's just a little sort of a token I got her. - Isn't that beautiful? - So you guys are just chillin', just kind of, like, cozyin' up, just kind of-- - What took you so long? - What? - I said what took you so long? - What do you mean what took me so long, I had to park, like, five blocks away. What is, like, the guilty faces and-- - Hey man, there's no guilty faces goin' on here, I'm just sittin' here, we're waitin' for you, I'm tired, I've been up for the last 14 hours playin', I mean, you know. - The fuck is this shit? What is your problem, Knox? - Yeah, this is, yeah, it's probably something he knows-- - Oh man, I hate being, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack right now, Jesus. - Oh my God, you are always so overreacting. Let's-- - Listen, I'm just-- - Work out between the two of you-- - No no no, why don't you stay, because it seems like-- - Oh no no no, oh no. - No no no, you're... - We're just sittin' here, we're just talkin'. - Good night, Matt. You just need to get over yourself. - What are you talking about, I walk in here-- - He remembered my birthday, got me a gift, which is something-- - Like, just cozy with each other, just like, you can't communicate with me at all, like, three hours ago, and then I come in and it's like... It's like you guys are just, maybe you guys are soul mates, you know, maybe, God, I don't know, I probably just overlooked that, I mean, maybe-- - No, you're probably just overreacting again. - No no no, I think that I'm probably the vehicle to bring you two together, you know, that's probably what, Jesus Christ, I can't believe that I-- - Knox, why do you always do this? - Why am I always put in a position to do this, is probably the better question. I mean, am I, you know... I'm trying to find the words to explain-- - Yeah well, find them, 'cause I'm getting tired. - Of miscommunication? Miss, like... Miss Fairy Angels, and all this bullshit, and like all this, like, like... I can't talk to you, and I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut and just give you this pouty little look and kind of expect you to read my mind, 'cause I mean, I think it's probably pretty clear how I'm feeling right now, I'm feeling kind of frustrated-- - No, you are coming off as being very insecure, very confused, very insensitive. - Nobody was likin' me too much, 'cause there was this horrible smell about me. You know, it was just, when you poop in your pants people say, "Did you "poop in your pants today," I'd go, "No." They look at you funny, and to myself I say, "That was yesterday." ♪ Walkin' on your own ♪ Trying to be your own best friend ♪ I don't know why I'm here ♪ I'm just here ♪ Not every day ♪ Wake up and get your highs ♪ Go down, I go tonight ♪ Not every day ♪ Feel good, get your own ♪ Why you would care and you're born here ♪ Say I don't know - It just keeps goin' like that, but there's a harmony in that chorus that's like... [singing] - So you're really after a pretty straightforward kind of pop, ear candy kind of thing here, and there's no problem with that in terms of, you know, our audience or, you know, at a club type situation where we're gonna be ending up doing sort of a three minute song for people, I don't know, with the dancers there, you're sort of focused on the radio. - Yeah, I mean, I'm not fighting it, I mean, this song, it feels good. You know, it's just, it seems to work, I think it fits in with everything else we're doing. - Okay. Where's the hook? You know, it's like... [snapping fingers] It's got me in an epic, but I don't have time to see Braveheart, you know what I mean? Where's the quick candy, where's the hit, where's the rent? - Well, hopefully those elements are gonna be brought in by the production and-- - Where's the chorus, you know, I mean, that's the problem is that I'm not really identifying-- - The chorus is in the harmonies. - Chorus is in the harmonies. - I mean, I admit it's not, like, the most sugar candy top 10 hit you over the head hit, but I think that there's something redeeming to it. But I mean, I can throw it on a four track and just let you judge it from hearing it from beginning to end. I could put my guitar parts on there, I could put the harmonies on there. 'Cause obviously it's not hitting you, and right now it's something that is speaking to me, so instead of wasting time like this, 'cause I mean, it's pretty clear, if you like it, you usually like it after hearing 30 seconds of something, you like it. Would that be, I mean... [soft guitar music] - [Mandeep] Hey,Yahn, how's it goin'? - How you doin'? - Good, good, how are you? - Mandeep, this is Jyota. This is Jyota. - Hi, Jyota. - Hey, nice to meet you. - Mandeep is my neighbor, and he's actually, he's a marketing guy for this software guy on the, whatever. - I try to be. - Try to be, yeah, but I've been talking to him about my screenplay, and he's gonna help me figure out ways to market it, or make it, like... - It's good, it's good. - What's this going on, man? This is really creative. - This is, right now this is the screenplay. I've just been, you know, I've been kinda stuck, but this is beginning to embody at least, you know, the themes that I want to address. - So where are we going with this? - Well, you know, it's kind of, at this point it's a collage, and I think that's what we need. - But you have to give me the script, man, because I need to help you sell it. You gotta earn a living. - I don't know if, I don't know, the script's not working. - How are you gonna pay your rent? - Well, you know, I'll keep doing what I do, you know, substitute teaching. - Well, but you gotta get your script out, man, you have some really good ideas. - [Yahn] Yeah, you think so? - Yeah, but you gotta get it on the print. Give it to me, man. I'll sell it for you. - [Yahn] All right. - [Mandeep] All right? - [Yahn] All right. - Can I pick it up tomorrow? - [Yahn] What, tomorrow? Maybe next week. - Okay, next week. - Well, I'm liking the music that I'm hearing, but I'm not hearing something that has the potential to land on the radio and sort of achieve the objective we've both been working pretty hard for in the past two and a half years here to do, and that's the main thing that sort of is concerning me about the song. I don't know, you seemed to have said you were gonna pay a lot more attention to coming up with choruses that instantaneously sort of ring in the ears of the listener, and what I feel is like I'm hearing you get much more into the musicality and the enchanting melodies, but I'm not hearing that thing, it's not coming quick enough. And I don't know if you just basically neglected that, or were you comin' on it, or are you just gonna wait for it, or this isn't-- - I think there's something really dangerous about, if we're that single-minded, I just, maybe I'm superstitious, but I feel like if we're that, you know, if we're just psychos about getting the hit then I feel like that's-- - Yeah, but I mean, but we need to be, because we're goin' crazy being here, we're goin' crazy here day in day out, working, taking the time of all of our people in our band to work on this material, we all need to pay our rent, you know, and we all basically wanna get on the map, that's why everybody's involved with the process. - All you need is to express yourself, who gives a shit how much money someone's paying you for? That's the way I see it, dude, and you are good, and your script is good. - [Yahn] Thanks. - So if they buy it 'cause it's good, that's good, but... [bongo drumming] - You know, it's okay to be an artist, but how are you gonna make a living? I mean, how are you gonna feed yourself? I mean, I understand your arty thing, I mean, I understand this, or maybe I don't, but I understand where you're coming from, but, you know, you gotta feed yourself, I mean, how are you gonna do that? I mean, you have to strike a balance. - But when you, you know, but when you market the hell out of stuff, it's like, you know, it becomes this brand name generic thing, it's like, how many people can we get to enjoy this? I don't think we're giving people options anymore as to what they might like, I think we're giving them cookie cutted things, it's like, this is what you liked last year, we'll give you, you know, we'll add sprinkles this time, but that's about it. - You can still give them this customized thing, but as long as there's something to it that people wanna watch or see or use, you know, you have to strike a balance. Anyway, man, but that's-- - Well, maybe people will pay for, you know, maybe people will pay for the art's sake. - Maybe they will, maybe they won't. - I hope art doesn't have to somehow-- - See, you have to decide what your objective is, I mean, either you do the art and put it in, hang it in your room, and that's enough, and then enjoy it, and I have nothing against that, I do that all the time, but if you wanna sell something, you've gotta sell something what people want, that's the difference. Art for yourself or art for others. [Jyota moans] - So it's kind of like you're taking on your creative little jaunt, yet sometimes, for whatever reason, maybe your headspace, I don't know, if there's some sort of thing going on with Cass or there's some sort of, like, somethin' you're workin' out that you need to go here to solve some problem-- - Cass, since when you been callin' her Cass? - Your girlfriend, your girlfriend, the woman who lives here, all right? You're trying to solve some problems, you're taking that journey, but you're taking us along with it, and it's really not our role, we never signed up for that, you know, and that's what I'm sort of concerned about. - Is this, are you trying to stir things, is this where the whole you and Cass kind of flirting more and getting closer, is that what this is? - No, no, no, if you really wanna know the frustration I'm having, it's that, you know, things are starting to go missing around here. [downbeat rock music] - You know, there's still a lot of people who don't believe in life after death or spirits, and I used to be a disbeliever myself until I heard of an incident that took place in my family. The story goes back about 40 or 50 years ago, this was my mom's aunt. This was back in a small town in India, and she was essentially a local town girl, she woke up one day and there were different voices that were not hers coming out of her mouth, and one was a man's voice, and another one was a female's voice. Obviously there was a lot of scare initially, because it was a fear of unknown, a local priest was called who set up a meeting with this individual. Some other people were called as well, there was like a community meeting, and the priest started asking questions to, not to my mom's aunt, but to the spirits that were inside her. And those spirits, essentially, were giving answers back like they were having a full conversation, and it turned out that those spirits belonged to a couple who had died just about a month before, and they felt they could not leave the earth because they had some unfinished business. And that's why they were going to stay in a body that they felt was very pure for a while before they left. And after that, more meetings were held almost on a weekly basis, more community town hall type of meetings where my mom's aunt will sit and there'll be people surrounding her, and different people will ask these spirits different questions, and obviously they were friendly spirits, and they were giving advices on what types of investments to make, what types of stocks to buy, what was happening all around the world. So slowly, the fear left everyone and people knew that these spirits were harmless, and they were going to leave in due course, and they did, about after eight or nine months they just disappeared when their job was finished. Whatever that was, they never mentioned that, and so I think, there were a lot of people who were skeptical, said, "She could be "making all these stories up," but it turned out that she was just a local town girl, had never left the town, never even had gone to high school, so there was no way she could be telling stories about Russia or China, or giving stock advices on different companies. So after that I've started believing in spirits and obviously in life after death as well, and I think if there are any disbelievers still, there are a number of these types of stories existing out there that they can use. [car door slams] - Willie? - [Willie] Yeah, hi, what's up? - I think we should sit down. Come on. - [Willie] Sit down? - [Red-Haired Woman] Yeah. - [Willie] What, did I give you some money? I can't give you any more money. - It's not about money this time. - [Willie] Yeah? - I have some news for you. It's bad news, I need you to be ready for it. I just got a call about an hour ago. It's about Cassandra. - What, is she like-- - Willie, she died. - Died? Just died, what? From what? - They're not sure yet. The call just came in an hour ago. She took a walk, she was near a cliff. They don't know if she fell or she jumped. - [Willie] Drinkin', was she drinkin'? - I don't know. I don't know. But... You have to take care of this. - Well, maybe I will have to make some calls, why don't you make some calls too, you wanna help me out with this, I mean, with the money, I don't have that kind of money. She's nowhere to be seen for two years, I don't see her, hear from her, or anything, and then all of a sudden I have to go take care of things when she's dead, is this the deal we're going? - Is this a big inconvenience for you? - Well yes, I'm not used to this, these things don't happen like this. She's gone for all of two years or something, and all of a sudden I'm supposed to jump when she's dead? What is this? - Your daughter has died! - [Willie] So, she's dead. You're dead too, as far as I'm concerned. Anybody who doesn't come back and see me, they only come back with the bad news-- - You need to take care of this, okay? I can't help you anymore. - [Willie] Just get the fuck outta here. - You need to do this. It's important this time-- - [Willie] Get the fuck outta here! - Listen to me, it's important! - Just get the fuck outta here, then, go on! Get the fuck outta here! Son of a bitch! Out, out, out!

And you had teddy bears like this, remember the teddy bears? They matched your dress. Your favorite one was Little Patch. He was a puppet, a little teddy bear puppet. - [Voiceover] I loved you so much, Papa. And you loved me. You loved your little girl. You just couldn't stand it when I started growing up. [Willie cries] - Where were we? I think we took a wrong turn, man. I don't like this, man. I got a weird vibe about this place. [cars passing] - Is this the right side or is this the left side? Is this the right side or is this the left side? [funky hip hop music] See, I'm walkin' down this creek, and that's when I see Willie boy. But I don't think I'm, I don't think... [Yahn stammers] I'm not an angel. No. I'm like this big, burly, rugged man. This is [mumbles]. - Okay. - And let's do that thing that I was telling you, but I'm not gonna preface it, we'll just go with the flow of it. - Okay. - This is almost like a morning coffee kinda outside in a cafe, or something. - Do you want a section? - Could I? - Yeah. - All right. Local news. So, I mean, do you have a boyfriend? - Yeah, sort of. Kind of, we're both pursuing things at the moment, so it's kind of like up in the air, when we have time. - Is he acting, too, or is he-- - [Muse] Yeah. - [Yahn] Oh, really? - Yeah. - Actors and writers, that works, but-- - Really? You think? - That's what I've heard, but-- - Oh, okay. - But the actor-actor thing is not... - So, say, for instance, this were to be in your script, like, how would I fit into that? - Well, you would probably be the... Pretty girl, the muse. You'd be the muse. The inspiration. Kind of the ball that gets everything rolling. - Does that mean that I'm providing inspiration right now? - You might be. [soft, pleasant music] - Anyway, the time is up, it's time to go, I can't take it anymore, I'm packin' up my stuff and my parents are comin' to get me. It wasn't about an hour later, we're drivin' home, and my father's goin', "What is "that stink in the car?" You know, I go, "I don't know." "It's just horrible," the windows are goin' up, he's lightin' up his pipe, "Let me smoke a cigar," they'll do anything to get rid of the smell. We finally get on the trunks, comes out of the thing and my mom opens it up and she said, "Look at that, this is the stink," and I'd packed all my underwear and socks with a poop, a load in each one of 'em, they were all stacked, there must have been about two weeks worth, at least 10 or 12 poops in my socks and stuff, and it was just in there with maggots and... Not a pretty sight. So that's campin', I never went campin' again, they never sent me campin'. I went on vacation with them after this. [sighs] [upbeat rock music]
