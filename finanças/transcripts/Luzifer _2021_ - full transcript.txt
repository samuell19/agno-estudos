Inspired by a true story. God, each spike on this crampon is a thorn in the crown of my little Jesus. Johannes. Since he was born we have lived up here for him, closer to you. Closer to heaven. Far away from the abusers, the abusers of the earth, who have abused you and me. I want him to be happy, God. When I am gone, I want you and him to be together. You are his Papa. Papa. Papa. Arthur. Stone. Johannes. Where's the devil? Where's the devil? Johannes, where's the devil? Heaven. Heaven. Drink. Johannes, we're the cross. I'm the cross, you're the cross. Our cross of love, you and me. Elia, Elia. It hurts so much that you are no longer with us. But we are here with you. God is with you. God wants to live in darkness. He also lives in the cold water, there in the water. My tears. Thank you, thank you that I'm clean and sober. Do you remember how you and Papa brought Arthur as a baby from his nest and how you learned to feed the baby? Baby. To feed him with Papa's snakes, the ones he carved for us. Snake. - Papa snake. - Hot. She is thirsty. - Will you give her something to drink? - Snake. A sip from me and now a sip from you. - Papa is flying to heaven. - Heaven. Who goes to heaven? Radio Maria is wishing you peace. Papa. Mama. Snake... Papa. God bless you. I haven't heard anything from the local office. What kind of offer? That's a lot of money. But I don't think I'll sell. Thanks for the petrol, Theo! Po - ta - to. God, thank you for Theo's help. For his mandrakes, for the petrol and that our cows give us milk. Up here I can be clean and sober. Up here my son is protected. My child. Hey, come here. Come here. Arthur. Johannes, show me your hands. Show me your hands. You must wash your hands. Shit. I won't sell. Please don't call me again. Love... is just another word. Cause love is just another word. Just dance on this earth. Dance on this earth. Love. Love. That might be too difficult. The mole, where's the mole? Here. Where's the mole? Where's the mole in Mama's picture book? Baby. Do you know what that is? It's the Ea, Ea, Ea, Eagle-Owl. Where is he? There. Exactly. Eagle-owl. There he is. Papa always did that. Papa always did that, remember? Papa. When I got these tattooed, Papa and I were already together. Papa. Your Papa. And here's Jesus. I had all these tattoos done. And Papa was always at my side. Papa saved my life. If not for him, I'd have been dead long ago. I'd have drunk myself to death. And I just wanted to disappear and stop living. And Papa just asked me, "Are you strong?" And then he told me about faith and God entered me. For me, he is the Big Jesus and you're his Little Jesus. Your Papa loved me. Where's the devil? Fly. Johannes! Johannes? The devil is not in the stones and not in the wind... Devil... not in the fire. Where's the devil, Johannes? Devil. They would destroy all of nature. These ski lift idiots. Burn. Mama. God, in your name I will donate half the money to the church. So that you will protect us and nature. I will never lose my way again. We will stay up here. And thank you for freeing me and making me clean and sober. Mama? Where are you taking the present? To the church. And don't go to the cave. Baby. Ouch. Nose. God bless you. I ring to check if it will work out the memorial place for my husband Elia. Exactly. It should all be on one line. It's a text that flies all the way to heaven and it should be right up by the church, next to the beautiful big beech tree. On the side where the altar is, to the east. And I really have enough money for it now. No, not like that. Like I showed you before. Like this, look, let's stop the car. Oops, look, like this. Try it. Look. Put one hand like this and the other over here, carefully. That's right. Like the eagle-owl, like the eagle-owl, right? Eagle-owl. Yes! I'll lend it to you, look after it! For your birds of prey. For the eagle-owl, OK? Now the baby comes. Shit. Good job, good job, come on. A little more. Johannes! Come over here. Come here. Look here! It's full of them, look! You should spray them once a day. Now you try. Open up the wings. Exactly! And there. There. Here, you can see them. Ouch. Ouch. The eagle-owl. Eagle-owl. Ouch. The eagle-owl, Johannes. The eagle-owl! Eagle-owl. Shall I go to Mama and say hello? Should I go over to Mama? Or shall I go later? Ouch! Ouch! No, not me. The eagle-owl, the eagle-owl! No! Now put your pants back on. Come on, put your pants on. Exactly. Get dressed. - Or I'll go to your Mama. - Mama. Exactly. The eagle-owl. It has quill mites. Eagle-owl. The eagle-owl. No, not like that! Under the skin. Hide in the bedroom. Hello? Johannes. Did you take the present to the church? Listen, Johannes. Resurrection morning. Is the present in the church? Yes. Close your eyes. I'll protect you from the devil. Mama. I'll protect him from the devil, I'll protect him from the devil. I'll protect him from the devil. Mama! What have they done to the generator? Theo! Stop the car. Who's going to repair the generator? Stop! Theo! Are they threatening you too? God, give us strength, make us strong to face these abusers. We won't let them drive us out, even if they steal our last candle. Make us strong to face the abusers. Make us strong to face the abusers. Make us strong to face the abusers. Make us strong to face the abusers. Arthur. Help my Mama. The pursuit of power is killing our world. Burn, colour of death! For Papa. Thank you that I have stayed clean and sober, thank you. Electricity. You can't charge your cell phone here any more. Devil. Where's the devil? Where's the devil? Where's the devil? God, I am only alive because you are my YOU. Because you love me. You are love, and love is like the sun. It rises and sets. It gets warm, it gets cold. But love is always there, like your love for me and my love for Johannes. Mama? Do you know what Mama is doing? Texts of love for Papa. I am holding a mass for him. There will be beautiful music. Can you help me choose the music? Close. Close your eyes. Tight shut. Now you can feel Papa. Can you feel him? Can you feel him embracing you and hugging you? Can you feel his soul? He is in you, he is in me. Even though he's in the water. Your Papa is in you. Johannes, chop wood. Where's the devil? Heaven. She will bring misfortune. Come to me. Look at your hand, look at it. I love your hand, you know. But now it's poisoned. Now the devil is in it. Everywhere, in your whole hand, in your fingers. It's there... smell it! The devil is there now. It is poisoned by her, whatever you do. You can wash and wash, but you won't get it out again. You won't get it out again. Devil. You won't get rid of him like that. No! Devil. No! Stop, not like that! Not with fire. With water. Not with fire! This time God will punish you. Stay down. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six. Good Boy. For Mama. Mama! Mama! We'll get help, let's go down to Theo. Theo? God, help me with your spiritual sword. Make me the sword of your justice against these wretched, evil pigs. Who want to destroy everything. Who cut souls into pieces and drag them to hell. Who kill. Give me the strength to fight. Please give me strength and thank you that I'm clean and sober. Resurrection morning. Our trees are all being felled. The world is dying. Let's go! Awesome. Piss off. Arthur? Arthur. Arthur. Arthur. Arthur! Johannes, what happened? Child. Arthur. What happened to Arthur? What's up? Come here! Child. What's happened to Arthur? Johannes, let's ask God to bring back your Arthur. - Arthur. - Come here. Blessed be the water against the devil. I'll protect him from the devil, I'll protect him from the devil, I'll protect him from the devil. Johannes, come to me! Johannes, do you think something evil has taken Arthur? Yes. Then wash me for Arthur. Wash me for Arthur. I am the cross, wash my body, so I can protect us from these demons. I am the cross. Wash my body. Wash! Clean! Clean. Yes, wash me! Thank you. From fire, to smoke, up to heaven... and your Arthur will return. From fire, to smoke, up to heaven. From fire, to smoke, up to heaven... and is free. Arthur. Good boy. Be quite now. Shit. Be quite. Sign it! Sign now. Baptism. Swallow it! Let's go. Now sign! Now sign! Fuck them. Let's go. God. God is inside me, Johannes. God is inside me. I can see you through his eyes. I see you going into the cave, to the waterfall. And you are afraid. And suddenly there were children, they were scared, just like you. But they were scared of you. You must not go to the cave. God wants you to stay up here. For Mama. Save. My beat. Save my beat. It beats for Papa and you. Save my rhythm. Save my... my rhythm. Mama... rhythm. Mama... rhythm. Mama... rhythm. Mama. Rhythm. Mama. Rhythm. Mama. Rhythm. Mama. Mama. Come here! What's wrong? Are you angry? - Are you evil, Mama? - Evil Mama. Do you want to be like them? Look at what they did. They were devils. Look closely.
