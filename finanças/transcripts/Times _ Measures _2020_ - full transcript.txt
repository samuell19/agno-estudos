Oh, morning! Sorry, Mum can I nick these? Where you going with those? You want a brew? Yeah. There you go. Why you in such a rush? Mock exams mum! Mum, I've been studying these for ages how can you forget this? Anyway, I'm meeting Emma before school to run through some questions. Just don't like it, they have you doing so much all the time. All these tests, revision, homework. When do you actually get time to learn something outside of a book? Like life? I'm off. Oh. Your tea? Have two. You deserve it. Have a nice day. Dear Corina Hades. We regret to inform you that you haven't been successful in your application for Administration Manager. We thank you for your time. The person you are trying to call is... The person you are trying to call is not available. Please leave a message, or try calling again later. Des. Whatever this is. You better snap out of it and come back and help your family. If not for me. Then for your daughter. You know, how could you do this to her!? Oh, hi Mel. How was your, um... Yeah fine thanks. Yeah your exam. You OK? Yeah, yeah I'm fine. Just got a lot on my mind, that's all. Look. I need to get a new phone. Ha, what, to call all your friends? Sorry, that was below the belt. Why do you need a new phone? Well I tried to call your dad didn't I? Well, I told you that was going to end in tears. Yeah, well. I really need to get a new phone now but I really shouldn't be spending out on one. Well you don't really use it anyway to be honest, mum. Well I need to be able to take calls and the speaker, look, it's broke! Not in a nasty way but who you expecting calls from, honestly? I'm just waiting for a few employment agencies to call and, like... What? I thought you were all sorted? Well I didn't want to worry you did I. No I need to know mum, I need to help. I'll get a part-time job stacking shelves or something. No. No way. You're seventeen you should be out having fun, you know. Not worrying about keeping the roof over our heads. Plus. I already tried to get a job stacking shelves and I got rejected. And it appears that I can't even get a job flipping burgers or scubbing toilets either. What? How? You were some like big time businesswomen right? You'll be snapped up like that, surely? I'm in something that I like to call a 'grey area' of employment I'm too overqualified for the lower end jobs and too long out of employment for the higher-end ones. So they're punishing you for choosing to be a mum. That's sexist they can't do that! You can burn all the bras you want Mel but sometimes life, it just doesn't work out the way you want. That why you called Dad? For help? What a prick. Mel! Well he is! He might be a prick but he's still your Dad. Listen. I'm the only one in this house that's allowed to speak badly of him, OK? You know you're lucky to have a mum like me. You know that, right? Right? Mel! Living room! I got one! Oh let me see. What the hell is that!? Don't Mel I mean, it's all I could afford! I doubt I was even born when this came out! Alright! When I get a job I'll get a better one. But right now, I mean, all I need to do is make and receive calls so it'll do won't it? To be honest mum, I don't even think it's going to be able to do that. You going to help me sort it? OK, well, where's your old phone? I just need to put that SIM card in. Here you go. Did you get this on a new contract? No I got it from the second-hand phone shop on the corner. Why you say that? There's already a SIM card in here. You got any tweezers? Yeah upstairs. Well I need to get this out to put your SIM in! Don't you break it, alright! I think it's going to take a bit more than some tweezers to break this brick. Alright, here you go. It won't come out. Alright, I'm meeting Emma at two so I really need to get ready. You have a try. Me? OK, just leave it on charge and I'll sort it when I get back. OK well I'm off Mum see you later! OK be careful. Oh yeah, hi there, yea, erm, I need to speak to someone about a declined council support request please? So there's no one available who can speak to me? Well can I request a revaluation please? Well how long is that going to take? And what do you expect me to do in the meantime? Sorry, who am I speaking to? Sue. OK, erm, well for your information Sue... Yea. Well my Daughter and I... We're in absolute dire straights to put it bluntly. Erm, we're literally days away from losing our home and being out on the streets so. No, she's seventeen? Well I don't have anyone else who I can ask for help. My husband walked out on us six months ago if you must know. The mortgage is in his name. Anyway, aren't you the ones who are supposed to be helping us? Like, isn't this why we pay tax? For you to help us? OK. Yeah OK Sue, yeah. OK I'll write a letter. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thanks. That you? Yeah. Good. I'll text you the coordinates for the parcel pickup. Hi Mum. Oh hi. Good night? Yeah. I'm going for a shower. OK but just don't use all the hot water yeah? I won't. Mum, what are these? Just something the doctor prescribed me a while back. What, so you're taking antidepressants? No! No I'm not! What are they then? The Doctor prescribed me a while back but I've never taken them. Look at the packet if you don't believe me. No it's fine I believe you. I just don't know why you didn't tell me? Well there's nothing to tell, Mel, really. Just one mention of the word 'sad' these days and the doctors are literally throwing antidepressants at you like they're sweets! It's nothing for you to worry about. Go and put them back where you found them. They might catch us a few bob if we need it. Here you go. Oh thanks Mum. You not eating? Oh not today, I'm not hungry. Actually, you can finish mine if you want I just realised the time. Bye. Have a nice day. That's far enough. Here it is. Now you know the drill. Once it's done, I'll text you collection coordinates. Mum? Where are you? Mum, you upstairs? Mum? Mum! I'm starving what's for dinner? Beans on toast? OK. What you been doing? I'm cleaning out the cupboards. Oh. OK. Mum, you alright? Huh? Yeah I'm fine. Yeah. Just not hungry. You weren't hungry this morning either. You sure you're not coming down with something? Hm. Yeah maybe I am? Think I'm going to call it a night and try and sleep it off. You OK to finish that and clear the plates up? Yeah of course. I'm not going to kiss you because of my germs, OK? I love you. I love you too. Right, night darling. Mum? Mel! What you doing up? Well I heard noises. What are you doing up sneaking around? You've been really funny today Mum, are you sure everything's alright? You're not taking those pills are you? No! No, I'm just a bit low at the moment. You know, as much as I hate your dad, I do miss him too. Oh Mum. You have a nightmare? Want to sleep in my bed tonight? I think I'll be alright. Want to have a hot chocolate and talk about it? I'm fine. Well I'm here if you need me. Now get some sleep OK and don't worry about that... 'person of interest'. Go'on. Bed. Oh alright Mel? I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't be putting that kind of thing on you. No it's fine Mum. You feeling any better today? Nah, still don't feel great so I wouldn't come too close if I were you. Alright well hand my tea over and I'll be on my way. Here you go. Actually, I'm running late can I take some toast to go? Yeah, sure. Crust? What's wrong with crusts? No worries, I'm fine. They're supposed to be good for you! Have a nice day. Mum I'm out tonight. What time's dinner? I'll make it now if you fancy? Yeah what we got? Beans on toast? Hm, again? Spaghetti hoops? Here you go. No beans then? Thought I'd mix it up a bit. Sandwiches Mum? You can't beat a good sandwich! Marmite? Yeah. I'm not five, Mum. You love it! That's your bloody Father, that. He told me you eat it out the jar. So are going to address the Voldemort in the room? Look, I'll always love your Father. He gave me you! Oh that's such a cliche cop out that all broken up parents say! Be honest. You hate him! Admit it, you've got a little Desmond Voodoo doll upstairs with pins stuck in him. Well, I mean, not quite. But it's quite a good idea! Mum. It's fine, you can be honest with me I understand. If my husband walked out on me after twenty years leaving nothing but a sorry note, I'd be livid! You know. You need to get a boyfriend, Mel before you can have a husband? Mum. Alright. I'm off. Staying at Emma's tonight so I'll be back sometime tomorrow. No kiss? Mum!? You nearly gave me a heart attack! Me!? I thought you was staying around Emma's? Yeah, nah, I didn't fancy it. A hammer mum? I took some extra precautions when your Dad left didn't I. I didn't even know we owned a hammer. You been drinking? One more year, why can't you just wait one more bloody year. Oh come on Mum it's fine! What are you doing anyway down here making such a racket? Trying to make noodles but I can't get the poxy hob to turn on! Well that's because you're bloody drunk Mel. Why don't you go and get yourself off to bed. Go on! I'll bring you up some water. Thanks Mum. Shit! OK well that all sounds fine Corina. So the candidate we're looking for would really need to have An extensive knowledge of all the latest administrational software. Mainly the entire 'Office' Suite. Is this something you are confident with? Oh yes I'm totally competent with all the latest Office Software. OK great so if I were to ask you to run an 'index match' What would that be in reference to? Well an 'Index Match' is the advanced alternative to the V and HLOOKUP formulas so you'd be requesting a more advanced financial analysis or a model. OK great. Very impressive. Ha, thank you. Well, everything seems fine with your credentials. Oh there's just one last question I need to ask. Oh please fire away. We noticed that there is a sixteen year gap in your employment history can you explain this please? Oh yes, so, erm. I had my beautiful daughter seventeen years ago and after much deliberation, erm, I decided to give up full-time employment and be a stay at home mum. And what now brings you back to employment, may I ask? Oh my Daughter she's now coming of age, she doesn't need me anymore, so you know, I feel like now is the right time... I'm sorry Corina I'm just going to stop you there, thank you so much For your time. Oh thank you. I think I've heard everything I need to know now. So we'll be in contact with you in due course. OK then, thank you. OK thanks, bye. Thank you. Thank you. Alright stranger. Well I'm guessing you don't want anything to eat? No. Drink? Interesting combo you've got going there, Mum. Skype interview. Any good? Some people just want to watch the world burn. Take that as a 'no' then. And I'll take it you had a good night of underage drinking again? Oh Mum, please. I'm closer to eighteen than seventeen now anyway. What does the law think is going to change in me within the next six months? One day I'll go to bed seventeen and I'll wake up eighteen. Nothing in me will have changed to control drink any better so I might as well start now. Absolute shambles. Apple. Tree! Well I wouldn't get too comfy on that sofa if I was you. Found a buyer. Coming to pick it up later. What? Where are we going to sit? The human race survived thousands of years without sofas, Mel. I'm sure we'll cope. Listen when I get a new job I'll buy us a new suite I promise. We interrupt this scheduled broadcast with breaking news. Minister of State, Aden Archer has been found shot dead At his home in Greenwich. There are no leads at this time, but a full investigation Is underway. Mr Archer was last seen by his wife just earlier That very morning. Police inform us that Mrs Archer returned home from work To find their home had been broken into And then tragically found the Minister of State shot dead. Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum!? Yeah? You alright? Yeah I'm fine. What's wrong, did you know him? No, I didn't know him. Nah. It's all just a bit, shocking, isn't it? Oh. Right. Yeah it is. What's that? Mum? Mum, what's wrong? Mum? We're broke, Mel. We're broke, we don't have anything. What? Why? We're literally days away from losing this house and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I can't do it! I've tried! It's not your fault. It is my fault, I've been applying for job after job after job. And no one will take me on! Don't you dare blame yourself! We'll get through this I promise. I just need a moment. OK. I love you. I love you. They think I did it. Are you... I'm OK now. I just needed to clear my head and make a plan. Look, you can't stay here when we've got no electricity. Do you think Emma's Mum will let you crash at her's for a few days? Yeah, I'm sure that'll be fine. Don't you worry about a thing OK? In a few days we'll be back to normal. Go and pack a bag, yeah? Oh fuck off! Mel? No it's me. Des? Whenever you're ready. Come meet me downstairs. How romantic. Well I noticed your gas and electric aren't working my dear so I took some initiative. Sit. Please. Fuck you. You think you can just walk out on your wife and kid? And then waltz back in here like nothing happened? Cori, please. Just... Not until you explain to me what the hell this is. Do you have any idea what we've been through? I believe this is yours? Please. Just sit. Thank you. Now, apologies for showing up like this I'm afraid I haven't got much time to explain. Was this all you? In a word, yes. If you'll allow me to be frank for a moment, Cori. My life with you, and with Melanie is something of a lie. No shit. You really have changed haven't you? That's pot calling kettle dont you think? Ha, yes quite. Look. I am truly sorry for walking out like I did but I needed to lay low. It was something of a selfless act for all of us 'desperate times' and all that. Don't you talk to me about desperate times. Anyway. I've been having a few problems at the office and I'm now in need of a new associate. A new associate. So this was all you. Like some sick little game. Well, hardly a game. More of a test. Who the hell do you think you are? Hannibal bleedin' Lecter? You flatter me. Look. I really don't have much time. The point is this. In my line of work there's not many people you can trust. I've known you longer than anyone and I believe you are one of the last few people I can rely on in this world. And, with your... Situation. And my recent requirement. I thought this could work out rather well for the both of us. So everything... From the phone... No. I'll admit that was my one hiccup. He was merely meant to leave the case. He somehow caught wind of his replacement and... Well. He didn't take it very well. What is this? Am I still asleep, dreaming? Am I!? Corina, that honestly wasn't meant to happen but my God, look at you! Look at how you dealt with the situation! I killed a man. I killed a man! In self-defence. I shouldn't have even been in that situation. Explain to me. Explain how my apparently beloved husband of twenty years sets me up to be potentially murdered. He tried to murder me. And you want me to sit here and say 'thank you for the opportunity'? Well I did clean up that little mess of yours so some small gratification would suffice. OK, Corina, look I really am running out of time now. Brass tacks. I know you're in desparate need of help and this is how I can put everything right again. For both of you. I mean, for God's sake we're sat here in the dark right now shivering. That's no life. Am I right in assuming you get how this all works now? I give you coordinates for a pickup. You then provide my contact with that pickup and pay them on delivery. A twenty percent cut off the top for you, of course. Everytime. You could have come to me at any time. But you waited and you waited until I was in dire straights didn't you? Why would I do this for you? How the hell am I supposed to trust you? Because you've run out of options. How long before time runs out and you lose everything? Let me help put things right. It's... A lot of money Cori. You're not even involved, merely a messenger. And we all know how that ends don't we? Right, I really must be going now. You've got my number. Sit down. Sit down! I deserve an explanation. That's the least you can give me. I loved you. Our marriage. Was it even real? It served a purpose. I gave up everything for you. For your career. Why? Why? Oh why the career change? The opportunity arose and I accepted. So that answers that then. How long? Two years, give or take. So how the hell do you go from being a Psychology Professor to whatever this is? Was it you that killed that poor Aden fella? Ah, that was always arranged to happen. Your scenario was never to kill it was to asses. I like to think of it as something of my Pavlovian masterpiece. So I'm just some drooling dog to you? Ah so you were listening? Get out. This and plenty more can be yours if you make the right decision. Mum, are you awake? Mel! What you doing back? It didn't feel right leaving you here on your own. So I thought we could be cold and hungry together. How are you dealing with this so much better than me? You're lucky to have a daughter like me you know that? I am. You're my rock you know that, don't you? Did you manage to sort out what you were planning? Are we going to lose the house? No. Really? Yeah. We're going to be fine.
