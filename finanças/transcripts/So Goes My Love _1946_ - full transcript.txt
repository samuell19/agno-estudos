Take 'em away. Put them down in the south pen, Joel. - Yes sirree, Mr Williams. Good day, Mr Williams. - Good morning, Miss Jane. You certainly fix yourself up elegant to bring your pigs to market. Howdy. - Howdy. Daniel, give me a hand with this. Jane, you are going on a journey. I am if you give me a good price for my pigs. Well, you got a fine parcel of pork there, Miss Jane. They are sound and they're solid. Grain, milk and acorn. What is the tare of this wagon? - 640 pounds, Daniel. 640 pounds. A standing hitch. That would be .. 13 .. 1322. Net weight for pork. That's right. At 8 cents per pound .. They're grain, milk and acorn fed. 9 cents per pound. That would be .. Let's see. 118 dollars and 98 cents. Call it 119 dollars even. And some people call you a hard trader. You don't mind taking greenbacks I hope. - Happy to have them. Sure. They are just as good as gold and easier to carry. Uncle Daniel, bring the bags. The stage is here. Thank you, Mr Williams. Makes you feel kinda sad selling your pet porkers, eh? Hurry up, Daniel. If I never see another porker till the end of my days .. It suits me down to the ground. Here is your pay, uncle Daniel. For the grain and the milk. You travelling south? - Yes. I am going to Brooklyn. Well, Brooklyn is a mighty high-toned city. But don't stay away too long. Because by next spring I hope you bring me back some more fellows like these. I've made a vow never to have anything more to do with pigs from this day on. Goodbye, uncle Daniel. Thank you for everything. - Take good care of yourself, Jane. What you going to do in Brooklyn, raise cows? Oh no, Mr Williams. I'm going to Brooklyn to get married. Goodbye. Goodbye. You must be very fond of weddings, sir. No. I just like to throw stuff at people. I beg your pardon, Miss. 321 Union Street. Oh, thank you. Did you say 321, John? - Yes, Mr Maxim. Oh, thank you. How's everything on the farm? Sir? I wasn't aware I had a sign on me saying I was just off the farm. You have though. The bloom in your cheeks. Complexions like yours do not grow in the city, Miss. Aren't you being a trifle forward? Where did you get those burrs in your pretty ears? He must have been standing on his head to get this many. That, or he's keeping his ear to the ground. He is probably in politics. There. Feel better? Now. Run on home. That's exactly what I intend doing. Good day, ma'am. Is Mrs Allison at home? She is indeed. I expect you are the master's cousin? Yes, I am. I will tell Mrs Allison you are here, Miss. Thank you. All I had to wear was my old brown taffeta. Mrs Allison. Your cousin is here to see you. She is? Ladies, I have an unexpected visitor. Mrs Allison's cousin. She is from up around Boston way. How nice. She will probably very shy and unsophisticated and countrified. Don't be surprised if she just says .. "Yes, mum" and "No, mum!" And blushes every time you speak to her. Excuse me. Hello. You must be Jane. - Yes. And you are cousin Garnet. It was so kind of you to have me come. Ladies, I want you to meet my husband's cousin. Miss Jane Budden. This is Mrs Benfleet and her daughter Josephine Maria. How do you do, Mrs Benfleet. And our next door neighbor Mrs Meade. How do you do, Mrs Meade. And Mrs Dresswell and her daughter Sarah. How do you do, Mrs Dresswell. And Mrs Gorman and her daughter Louise. Mrs Gorman. Miss Gorman. And Mrs Lang and her daughter Jane. How do you do Mrs Lang. It was so sweet of you to have all your friends in to meet me, cousin Garnet. I thought you would enjoy knowing my friends. I'm sure I will. Oh, thank you. Theodore thought your trip to the city may be of a serious nature. It is very serious to me. Oh well, if you have come to see a doctor, my dear .. I must recommend Dr Ledner to you. He is the most marvellous man. What he did for my sister in law was nothing short of miraculous. Thank you. But my visit is prompted by an ambition, not an illness. An ambition? Oh, I do hope you are not one of those dreadful girls of the future .. We are always reading about in the periodicals. The sort that want to go into trade or politics. I understand that in one the New York counting houses .. There is an unmarried woman who holds a very responsible position. And does very well at it. I don't envy her. Then you are not planning on employment in a counting house, Jane? Oh, no. I'm planning on getting married. Some gentleman from Boston, Jane? No. He won't be from Boston. He is right here in Brooklyn? I hope so. My dear, is it someone from Brooklyn? I don't know. You don't know? I don't understand, my dear. Who is this gentleman? I haven't met him yet. I mean, I am looking for a husband. And I know exactly the kind of man I want. And what type is that, my dear? He should be in a substantial profession. Have a nice house to live in. Sufficient income to run it. This is shocking. Josephine Maria, cover your ears. I never heard such bull talk in all my life. You are jesting? No I am not, cousin. I'm being very practical. Practicalities have no place in true love, Miss Budden. I agree. But it is just as easy to fall truly in love with a rich man as a poor one. Hello, Mrs Meade. As your landlady and well-wisher. I think I should warn you. Go ahead. Warn me. A designing woman has moved in next door. Which house? - She's visiting the Allisons. The things she said today I never heard a woman say before. What did she say? I don't know whether I can tell you. Sure you can. If you don't you'll burst. She said she came to town to marry a rich man. Sit down. I want to hear more. Well .. she walked in .. Miss Budden? Yes. May I come in? Yes. My name is Hiram Stevens Maxim. Miss Budden, you may recall we met last week on a horse car. Oh yes. You helped me with my luggage. So, you do remember. Are these for me? For you alone. They are lovely. Miss Budden, I'm told by a mutual friend your purpose in coming to Brooklyn .. Was to find someone who would make you a suitable husband. Oh. I did say that. The qualifications I believe as you stated them .. Were that the man must be a substantial and respected citizen of the community. Oh. Yes. Will you come into the parlor? Thank you. I wanted to thank you for being so kind to me the day I arrived in your city. I am happy to have been of any small service. With your permission? - Please. About the man who would lay suit to your heart, Miss Budden. He must, I think you said, be a man of substance? Have a home ready for you to brighten with your presence. A future that is safe and assured and be well-endowed with this world's goods. Well. I have always dreamed of having a home of my own. Not a home. A shrine, you should say. A shrine to a woman's loveliness. And now miss Budden, I must say something that isn't easy to say. It is something that is awkward in the face of your radiant beauty. But being what I am .. A poverty-stricken inventor without the respect of the community. With no money. With a 3rd-floor hall bedroom as my abode. I came to tell you if you are looking for a substantial husband .. Don't count on me. I think I will wear it to the musical hall. I hope you're not going with that odd fellow across the way. He's crazy, isn't he. - Yes. But in a nice sort of way. He reminds me of the boys in the old country. What in the name of all the saints is he up to now? Look! Hello, Mrs Meade. I was just working on this with a curling iron. I see. Something new? The curling iron of the future. Self-heating. No smudges, even temperature. Keeps hot constantly when in use and handy to use. Always inventing and tinkering and experimenting. Experiments are just the beginning. By the way, do you have any coal oil? - About a gallon. It is highly inflammable, Mr Maxim. - Not when you know how to use it. Alright, I will get it for you. It's a dream, Miss Jane. A dream. Keep it on until the madam sees how fine you look. What is that? A conflagration. Free the ladders. Man the hose. It's the Brooklyn Blades Volunteer Company Number 1. They are the first on the scene again. Come on. Back up there, folks. Let the firemen through. Step back there, sonny. There is Captain Josephus Ford. Scaling crew in action! They are just like circus performers. Kinda smoky. Save the stream. New station. That's dangerous. - It sure is dangerous. That's why when a man marries, he has to resign. Save the stream. No flames in the house, Captain. Maybe it's between the eaves. Secondary hose men. Where is the fire? Oh, this? Oh, there is no flame in here. It's just smoking a little. That's all. It is .. it's an invention of mine. It got a little hot. It smoked up the whole darn house I guess. If I had known you fellows were out here I would have told you sooner. I guess the laugh is on you. Let them all go. You are more than kind, dear Mr Weldon. It is you who are kind to me, Miss Budden. I drink this with the hope that you will let me call on you soon. Was I too bold Miss Budden to express a wish to call? Oh no. Not at all. Will you excuse me. I will be back in a moment. - Certainly. What were you shaking your head about? I was just warning you. He is not the one. - He is not the one what? The one for you to marry. He couldn't give you the house or anything. He lives off his father. - My dear Mr Maxim. I've tried to make it plain that I'm not one whit interested in your opinion .. Miss Budden. If you are free, may I have the pleasure of taking you to view the gardens? They are the most beautiful in the city. They are said to be an enchanting setting for a lady of real loveliness. Well, I should like to very much, Mr Raymond. But I think .. Some other time, Mr Raymond. As you say, Miss Budden. Perhaps I could then hope to join you at supper later? Thank you, but .. There you are. May I have the honor, Miss Budden? Indeed you may, Captain Ford. And what is your profession, Captain Ford? The law, but I don't spend much time on it. No? I am more interested in real estate. I've just built the new docks. Oh you did? Do you own ships too? I plan to have quite a fleet in time. Now, I am acquiring property. Property that I think in few years will be the most valuable in the city. I should like to hear about it. I think .. very soon .. There will be great opportunities again. For great fortunes. So do I. And I aim ma'am, to be ready to amass one when the time comes. You are right, Captain Ford. You are so right. Wait a minute. I haven't finished. "But get through the storm we must, no matter what the cost." That was a mean thing I did. Getting you to go after old ironsides. Old ironsides? Josephus Ford. I have had the pleasure of Mr Ford's company a number of times since then .. And find him a perfect gentleman. A perfect bachelor, you mean. Oh, he'll take you out on carriage rides. But to get him in a carriage and getting him to the altar are different matters. Then you think he's toying with my affections, Mr Maxim? Well, Miss Jane. If it wasn't the fact I feel responsible that you accept his spurious attentions. I wouldn't say a word. Oh Mr Maxim, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Please Miss Jane, I beg of you .. - Oh, Jane. Good afternoon, Mr Maxim. Mrs Allison. Mr Maxim has been warning me about one of Brooklyn's great pitfalls. The design is very agreeable, don't you think? It's lovely. Mr Maxim. Do you know anything about printing? I know a little about everything. Well it is very neat. It's good paper. It must be his money. - Must be. How can she possibly prefer Josephus Ford to me? Ore even me. For Jane, Captain. To Jane, sir. It is very lovely. We have a lot of witnesses for the great event. Everybody who is anybody in Brooklyn, is here tonight. Sir? I congratulate you and wish you the very best. And you, fair lady. You have won the prize for which so many others tried. Just look at them. Where on this earth may you see anything to compare to the fitness of this union? Miss Budden. Whose beauty and grace is so radiant. It makes you hurt inside with the pain of its perfection. And melt underneath the warmth of its glowing light. And Captain Josephus Ford. The very picture of solid respectability. Solid worth. In short, a solid man. Who has given the fruitful years of his youth. To gain his present estate. And those years were not spent in chasing dreams. They were not given to the frivolity of small gaieties. They were not spent revelling in the joys of life. No, sir. But to fit himself to take his place. With the solid, sober, prudent leaders of our great city. To make himself like unto them. And he will be like them. For he will by day and by night .. Live the kind of life .. That makes men the solid pillars of our great city. And so on this joyous occasion. Almost a public celebration. I give you that worthy man .. Capitan Josephus Ford. And Jane. I give him to you too. Your eulogy sir, was a masterpiece. It was nothing. It was in here. It just had to come out. You are more than kind, Maxim. Oh .. Much more, Mr Maxim. Josephus. The councillors are here. I think we had better go to sign the marriage contract. Is there going to be a marriage contract? I thought that sort of thing was old-fashioned. Old-fashioned and sensible. But don't you worry your pretty head about it, my dear. Your cousin's attorneys and I have worked out all the terms. Terms? That does sound sensible. And business-like. It's just a custom, Jane dear. That precious little frown tells me you are thinking. And women shouldn't think when they have men to do it for them. If you will excuse me for a few minutes. - Mr Ford. If you will permit me? My feet hurt. I am glad of a chance to tell you I saw no humor in your speech, sir. I tried only to tell the truth, Miss Jane. You were all the things I said you were and .. He certainly will become all the things I said he would. Just as soon as you sign up, your life will be settled. Is it an effort for you to be insulting or does it just come naturally? Why Miss Jane, I am not insulting. I approve of a marriage contract in your case. I prefer not to discuss my marriage with you, Mr Maxim. Alright. Then I will tell you about my marriage. Your marriage? If, as, and when it takes place. There won't be any contracts. Because I don't have anything to protect from a grasping wife. And there won't be any security for the poor wretch who marries me. I have none to give. But you have your charming self. And that no doubt will make up for an awful lot. It will have to. All my poor wife will get is being in at the start of the race. And she will have to help me. I will need her. I'll need her strength when I weaken. I'll need her love when I am defeated. I'll need her laughter to match my own. Sometimes, I will need her tears. Why, her tears? Well, we'll fight. She'll cry and then we'll make up. You can't make up unless there are tears to kiss away, so I'll need her tears. And she'll probably always want things you will never be able to give her? What she gets will be what we together will be able to find in life. It won't be a marriage like yours. Your life will be readymade for you. My wife will marry a pauper. You are going to marry a king. Now you are being fantastical. Josephus is just a businessman. He is not a king. Yes, he is. Hi subjects are all four-footed but they do him homage. Is that another insult in disguise? - No. It's the truth. Only today he bought out Forman's packing plant and became the pork king. King of the pigs. And just think, you will be their queen. Did you say "pigs"? "Pigs" is vulgar. "Porkers" is a better word. Jane. Jane, it is all settled. Josephus was most generous. Why, there isn't a girl in Brooklyn who wouldn't be as proud as punch .. To be in your shoes tonight. Just think of it. Mrs Josephus Ford. You know, you are a very lucky girl. Jane. Your cousin's attorneys proved be hard traders. But I am better than satisfied with my bargain. Garnet said that you were more than generous, Josephus. Can you excuse me? I want to find Theodore. Certainly. Cousin Garnet. Let me tell you the terms. - Please, I don't want to hear them. I am very grateful for everything. There is nothing I have that is not to be yours. My name. My house. My fortune. I understand you engaged in a new business venture today. Yes. An extraordinary enterprise. One I have wanted for many years. Wait until you see my prize boars. All champions. And my sows .. and their beautiful little sucklings. All soon to become full-grown pigs. And there are thousands of them. Thousands? Come. Let's go in and sign the marriage contract and set the date. Oh, you go in. I have to find out about something. - Of course, dear. Don't be long. You look like a queen standing there. Bridget. Have you seen Mr Maxim? - Yes, Miss. He just left. Mr Maxim. Do you want to marry me? What? Well, do you? If you do, please say so instead of making me ask you. You are sure you are in your right mind and know what you are doing? Positive. I thought I was crazy but you are the loveliest lunatic I've ever seen. Because I am going to marry you? Yes. You wanted things only a rich man can give you. Now you don't want those things at all. - Yes I do. And we are going to have all those things. A family. A house. And each other. I'm just a tinker. I should live in a wagon filled with pots and pans. You are a great man. And someday you will prove it. Me? Yes. You. Suppose I don't? You will. You know you would be a lot safer marrying Josephus Ford. Miss Budden. My offer of marriage is withdrawn. I had great hopes for our union, Miss Budden. I thought together we might accomplish great things. That we might establish a dynasty that would grow in stature as the city grows. That we would be people of importance in the city. That our name would be synonymous with the growth of the city in which we live. That we would wield our power with the fullest sense of responsibility. And with a warm benevolence. But if that is not to be. Then I shall go on .. alone. And I tell you both now. That Brooklyn will be one of the biggest cities in the United Sates. And I will be one of the biggest men .. In Brooklyn. Perhaps we had better begin the ceremony. We are gathered together to witness before this company. The joining in the state of matrimony. Of these two young people. Ladies and gentlemen. The public school question. Is .. Ladies and gentlemen. The public school question is one that is important. To every village, hamlet .. I wish I had said no. When I asked you to marry me? - Yes. Then I wouldn't have to go through this ordeal. I dislike speeches or people who listen to them. And I hate people who make them. But the committee on the establishment of public schools may .. Listen to this and see if sound alright. Ladies and gentlemen. The public school question is one that is important .. For every village, hamlet .. City and township .. In the United States. All men are guaranteed .. All men are guaranteed equal opportunity. For freedom. The opportunity of education for all. Is the basis of that guarantee. I am going to have a baby, Hiram. Man needs knowledge to meet the conditions ahead. Conditions .. Of the mechanical age. No. Man needs knowledge to meet the conditions ahead. Conditions in the age of machinery. Hiram, I am going to have a baby. Please, I am trying to make this clear. Man needs knowledge to meet the conditions ahead. Hiram. Please. I've got it now. Ladies and gentlemen, the public school question. Is one that is important to every village, hamlet .. City and township in the United States. All men are guaranteed .. Equal opportunity for freedom. The opportunity of education for all. Is the basis of this guarantee. Man needs knowledge. To meet the conditions ahead. Conditions of an age of machinery. And I am going to have a baby. I am going to have a baby. Shush. Don't cry. Shush. Shush. Don't cry. Just go to sleep. Let him cry. You are trying to think. I'm just thinking he has a lot to cry about. Dusty played a mean trick on him giving him a failure as a father. Oh, I see. Do you think he knows it already? Well, the sooner he finds it out the better. I've been working on the simplest of inventions for 6 months .. And I'm no closer to the solution now than I was the day I started. Come on, son. Cry good and hard. Daddy has come a cropper. I never was any more than a tinker and he'll never be more than a tinker's son. Did you hear that baby boy? What do you think daddy is going to do now? What? Hang himself? Oh, no. Huh? Throw out the invention and fix pots and pans for a living? Oh, son. How can you say anything like that? He believes you. He thinks you've failed. Well, I have. I'll tell you what he is going to do, son. He is going to call himself names for a while. And then he will pick that model out of the basket and start drawing a new plan. Oh, yes he is. That is what he always does. And then he is going to get an idea how to overcome his difficulties. And pretty soon he'll have a new invention all made. And then, my little man. He will be insufferable to have around. And he will act like a great big genius until he gets in trouble again. He is asleep. I'll put him to bed. Thomas! Thomas, stop that. Stop it, Thomas, Stop it. What is your name, young man? That is what started the fight, sir. My name is Percy Maxim. My father doesn't have wheels in his head. And I'm not a girl .. Young ruffians! Stop it now. You must stop it. Percy. Thank you, sir. - Is this your son, ma'am? Yes, and that is yours I presume? Yes. I am ashamed to say it is. He looks like a very nice little boy. He said Papa had wheels in his head. Looks are frequently deceiving. You can stop that nosebleed by putting a cold key at the back of his neck. That is how I stop Percy's. Girl boy, girl boy. Percy, Percy girl boy. May I, Mama? No, Percy. We are going to see your father. Aren't you going to put the beefsteak on first? No. I want your father to see it in all its pristine glory. Jane, I want to show you something. This is an arc light. I want to show you something, dear. Look at Percy. Oh son, you must learn to dodge. I tried to, Papa. - What happened to the other fellow? The other fellow has a bloody nose, skinned knuckles and a torn blouse. Oh good. It was Tom Phister. Phister? And well-named he is, too. It seems young Mr Phister commented without compliment .. On Percy's name, his curls and few other matters. He said you had wheels in your head, Papa. He did? And that you acted like a lunatic. And your name was "Mr Crazy". A very ordinary sort of boy, this Phister. I am going to show you how to dive so he next time you meet this boy .. There isn't going to be any next time. Percy is getting a hair cut thus afternoon. Like Papa's? Now just a minute, Jane. Percy, would you step into the kitchen. - Hiram. My mind is made up. Must I go out into the kitchen? Perhaps it is better if you do. Hurry along, son. And close the door. Jane, another black eye is not going to hurt that boy. But it hurts me, Hiram. The boys all pick on him because of those silly curls. That's exactly why I want him to keep them. So he'll get plenty of practice defending himself. When he grows up he'll be just like his father. Never have to take anything from anyone. Hiram. The curls must go. No, Jane. - Yes. It is enough to be named Percy. That will get him a sufficiency of fights. And defending your mad little manners will get him into a few more. With the curls added. All he does is indulge in fisticuffs. Hiram, if this keep up. He may turn out to be a pugilist. Curly Percy Maxim. Heavyweight champion of the world. Papa. Is it all settled? Well, not fully. I don't think so. Is it Jane? Yes, dear. Hiram, hand me those scissors. Up in the chair, Percy. Are you enjoying the teacake, Percy? Do you think it may taste better if you asked mother's permission to take it? I don't know. It tasted pretty good. It is good manners to ask for something you want. Even better manners to wait until you're invited before helping yourself to food. Am I invited now? No Percy. You are not. I can ask for something then? Done. Don't you want to be a gentleman? Like Papa? Well .. Yes. Your father is always polite and has good manners on all occasions. Well. Now and then perhaps he forgets. But he has a lot on his mind and he is usually most polite. I want to be like Papa. - Good. Then take off your hat. That's better. Yesterday your cousin Garnet told me she met you on the street. And you didn't take off your hat when she spoke to you. She had her hat on. She is a lady and must wear a hat on the street. But you are a little gentlemen. And when conversing with a lady you must always remove your hat. Yes, ma'am. Now, when cousin Garnet comes this afternoon for tea. Can I go out and play with my dog? Not "can I", "may" I. I want you to stay here and be extra polite to cousin Garnet. Can I? May I? Do I get invited to have another cake? Perhaps later. But remember, you must make your manners to cousin Garnet first. Yes, ma'am. [ Doorbell ] Now, go and show your cousin Garnet in. Then do I get a cake? Go and answer the door. Never mind Emily. Percy is going to the door. Good afternoon, cousin Garnet. Well master Percy, are you playing footman today? No, cousin Garnet. I am being polite. Then put that up for me. You weren't very gentile when I stopped you on the street yesterday. I forgot to be. I had lot of things on my mind. Oh, hello Jane. Garnet, how well you look. - And you. Jane, I love your new house. Thank you. How is dear Mr Maxim? Busy and in fine health. And Theodore? - Oh, busy. Mama, wouldn't it be polite now to invite cousin Garnet to have some cakes? Percy, your hat. Garnet, would you like your tea right away? Yes, I believe I would. I am famished. I've been shop trading all day. Oh, Jane .. that table. I want one just like it. But good wood carvers are so hard to get these days. They have all migrated out to the west. Theodore says the wages they are receiving out there .. Hiram might be able to help you. He knows where to find good workers. I'll have to ask him. Hiram has done remarkably well. But for certain things he might do better. No-one is perfect, Garnet. I'm not talking about perfection. I am talking about being normal. People have the notion that your husband is an eccentric. Otherwise he might be the head of a great company. Hiram doesn't want to be the head of a great company. If he did I am sure he could be. Would you like a cake? You must admit, Jane. He is rather unconventional. I think "progressive" is a better way to describe him than "unconventional". And I am sure Hiram wouldn't be one whit interested in how we described him. Well I must say love is certainly blind. Oh, my goodness! Are you alright? Yes, but look what I did to one beautiful teacup. Don't bother about it. You couldn't help it. I am so sorry. I am sure I never touched this ball of yarn. It .. Percy. I am sorry, Mama. Young man. Apologise to your cousin Garnet. I didn't mean for it to break. I am not talking about what broke. Apologise for the despicable thing you did with the knitting needles. I am sorry, cousin Garnet. - You are a very bad boy. If you were my young man I would make you sorrier still where you sit down. I'll sit on the needle, cousin Garnet. Your father gave me this tea-set when you were a little baby. I just thought it would be a good joke. Jokes. Sounds just like his father. Hello there. I am glad you are home, dear. Cousin Garnet. What is wrong? Oh. Had a little accident? It was no accident, Hiram. Percy is getting more unmanageable every day. What did he do? He put those needles on the seat of cousin Garnet's chair .. Just as she was sitting down. Spare me further details, please. - Hiram. I thought he would take it that way. Jane, just what do you want me to do? I want you to give him a good, sound whipping. You will have to do something drastic to curb this kind of mischief. Well, I have never given him a whipping before. That is plain to be seen. Yes, I suppose it is. Percy. Yes, sir? You have a lesson coming to you, young man. Yes, Papa. We'll have to cut a switch for it I guess. Come along. Now, for this kind of whipping we need the right switch. Yes, Papa. This one looks like it might do. We don't want one that is too long or too thin. A long thin one would sting alright but it wouldn't last long. It would break after a few blows. Hold that will you, son. We had better get one that is a little bit stouter. How about that one? Yes. Of course we don't want one that is too stout. One that is too stout would .. Bruise you. And we don't want to do that do we, son. No, Papa. There, hold that. We had better get one that is a little bit stouter still. We'll try this one here. Yes. This ought to do nicely. They are going up the back way. Oh, don't act like a ninny, Jane. The switching will do the boy good. Should I do this now? - No. No. Not yet, son. We've got to test the switches first. No, I didn't think that one would do. Too thin. This one is heavier, Papa. Well, we'll try it. He will never make Percy cry. Well, that one didn't seem to have much spring to it. We'll try this one. That's the one I picked out. Well, they all break. I got a baseball bat in my room, Papa. That wouldn't break. No, son. We need something with good spring to it but .. Strong enough to stand up under heavy blows. Let me think. Oh! I know just the thing. It's a real good one. This cane that Mama bought you. It bends a little and it's good and strong. Try it. Well, this might do nicely. Spare the rod and spoil the child. You try it, son. Me? Yes, you. Hit it much harder. No. Put more beef into it. Harder still. Stop! We experimented dear, but we couldn't find the proper switch. I guess we will have to dispense with the whipping. Your mother came up to stop the whipping. That is how much she loves you. And I really would have made your mother suffer much more than you, son. Because whatever pain you had she would have had a hundred fold. Your mother has been very good to you, Percy. But you haven't been very good to your mother. I'll buy you a new tea-set, Mama. I'll spend all the money that Papa made me put in my bank for a rainy day. My good man. You! I am speaking to you. To me or to him? - To you. Is this the home of Hiram Maxim, the inventor. Yes. It is. Confound it, you stupid oaf. Why didn't you tell me the paint was still wet? You didn't ask me. I am Doctor Willis of the Hall of Science. How do you do, doctor. I am Mrs Hiram Maxim. How do you do. Your painter has smeared my hands and grossly insulted me, madam. Painter? Why that is mister .. I think your roast is burning. I am so sorry. My colleagues and I are here to confer a great honor on your husband, ma'am. Oh? Well that is most gratifying, gentlemen. We would like to see him. Confounded oaf. My husband isn't in right now. He is working very hard on a new enterprise. Do you expect him soon? I am afraid to say when he'll be in. Won't you .. We can perhaps make the arrangements with Mrs Maxim, doctor. But I would like to meet the man. I admire him no end, madam. And he has the greatest respect for you, Dr Willis. I deem Hiram Maxim one of the greatest inventors and engineers of our time. His perfecting of the arc light alone makes him an international figure. On the 21st of December we must dedicate a new wing of the Hall of Science. In that wing, madam. We will unveil the portraits of three of the most outstanding contributors .. To the new age of machinery. James Watt. Robert Fulton. And Hiram Maxim. Doctor Willis. This is one of the really happy days of my life. This recognition of my husband's work will do much for him and for all of us. You will notify Mr Maxim to have the portrait done as soon as possible. Indeed I will. We would like to have it for framing. By December the 1st. Never fear. You will have it before then. Just so we can hang him before the 21st. They are going to hang you before the 21st, Papa. No they're not, son. You stay here. This dedication will be a great occasion, Dr Willis. A noteworthy occasion, ma'am. A monumental date of science and those engaged in its advance. Just a minute. I have a question to ask. How many times to I have to tell you not to come in here, Ed Patterson? You've been impertinent to Dr Willis. Now you come tracking in here to ask a silly question about what to paint next. These gentlemen are here to pay a great honor to my husband. That is what I thought but it seems to me .. Please leave before they change their minds. Maybe you husband doesn't want to have his picture painted. Mr Patterson, that will be about enough out of you. If you don't leave immediately I'll have to ask these gentlemen to assist you. That ought to be fun. How about it? Stop playing the fool. Or I shall have to speak harshly to my husband about your conduct. Oh, is that so? Let me say Mr Maxim will have something to say about the way you're treating me. Ma'am. I am so sorry, but the poor fellow just isn't all there. He might be dangerous to have around, ma'am. Oh no. My husband likes to keep him working. He has known Ed all his life. Ed Patterson? She was really raring to go on, son. Well, let's get back to our painting. Here they come again, Papa. Are you going to honor Mr Maxim for his inventions? Yes, we are. I thought I should tell you I am the one responsible for most of his good ones. Of course. Of course. Good day. Poor man. Still cross? I'm not cross. I am just a little discouraged. You wouldn't want me to be the kind of man who had his portrait painted and .. Hung in a public place, would you? - I certainly would. Well, I am not going to do it. - It's a great honor. People would know what a great man you are. Why, I am just plain old Ed Patterson. Ed Patterson deliberately made Dr Willis get all smeared with paint, didn't he. I'll admit old Ed helped. Hiram. You shouldn't do things like that. You can't break all the conventions. How would you feel if I were to carry on in an unconventional manner? What would you do? Well, I don't know. Go out in public without a hat on. Not wear gloves. Oh. How the tongues would wag. Or smoke cigars like that woman in Paris, Madam George Sand did. Well, I personally don't care for the taste of tobacco but you might like it. You wouldn't .. - Goodbye, dear. See you tonight about five. Emily. Yes, ma'am? I want you to go to this address. Give the letter personally to Mr Anton Magel. Yes, ma'am. He is a very important man, but insist upon an answer. Yes, ma'am. I am asking for an appointment tomorrow. Tell him I will suit his convenience. Yes, ma'am. Is there anything else, ma'am? - No. That will be all. Oh, Emily. On your way back stop in someplace and get me a good 5-cent cigar. What did Mr Magel say? He said he would see you tomorrow afternoon at 3:30, ma'am. That's good news. Not a word of this to Mr Maxim. - Oh no, ma'am. Thank you. Do you have half a lemon, Emily? Yes, ma'am. I just want to kill the taste of something I have to take. Oh, don't you feel well, ma'am? I feel alright now, but .. Maybe later .. Jane. Oh. There you are. My favorite dress. My, it looks lovely. Jane, the ladies of the Purity Committee to see you. Come in. Come in. Are you Mr Magel? Yes. You are Mrs Maxim. What do you want? I would like you to do a portrait of my husband. Good. Tell him to sit over there in the light. Then, I see. But my husband isn't here. If he is not here where I can see him, how can I tell if I can paint him? I am Anton Magel. I Magel do not paint .. Cats in bags. Pigs in pokes. If Magel doesn't find the subject's face interesting, Magel does not paint it. You will find my husband's face very interesting. Maybe. Could you look at it tomorrow? Tomorrow? Perhaps yes. Yes. Tomorrow I study him very good. And then Magel tells him .. yes. Orr tells him .. no. Oh. But .. Could you just study his face and then tell me? So? So that if you do say yes I can tell him quietly. Quietly? I don't want him to even guess that you are an artist studying his face. Hmm, some kind of humbug, huh? Magel makes no humbug. I know. But I want this to be a great surprise. Oh a surprise? Good, good. Very charming. Magel make a surprise. Magel even come to your house. Oh thank you, Mr Magel. We'll surprise him no end. If. I know. If you like his face. Good day. Good day, Madame. Thanks a lot, Ed. - Not at all, Hiram. 944 Queen Street? Yes, it is 944 Queen Street. - Thank you. I am Magel. I am Maxim. - Nice weather, no? Yes. It is very nice. Mrs Maxim is not at home, sir. - Fine. Would you like some coffee, sir? Please. If you would .. In here. Here, please. The light is better. Read your paper. Relax. Go ahead. You wanted to see me? Very much, Mr Maxim. Very, very much. About what? About .. You want to see me about what? Oh. I just wanted to see you. Oh. Are you an inventor with an idea? Please, do not mix it up. You are the inventor. Well, what is your idea? Idea? It is .. it is too early to have an idea. Magel thinks you are going to be fine. Oh. Please .. turn the head. Just a little. Magel says turn the head. Get out! - I am Magel. Get out! Hiram! Hiram, stop. That man is a lunatic. - What did he do? He's in there looking all round me, at my head and looking at my ears .. Saying "you'll be fine, you'll be fine". I must find out what he's plotting. Let him go. He said you'd be fine, did he? Yes. But I've no idea what he talked about. I wouldn't worry about it, dear. Mama. That man left his hat. Put it in the house, Percy. He'll come back. I just hope he does. - So do I. Jane, I am not going to do it. In the first place I don't have time. It takes weeks to get a portrait painted. Just an hour each sitting. Well, I haven't time to sit around for even an hour. Oh, Hiram. It is a great honor, dear. Let them give it to somebody else. Hiram. I am sorry to be stubborn, Jane. But I'm not going to have my portrait painted. Not if I can help it. Do you remember a speech you made .. Once on behalf of free public schools? Yes. Remember what you said? Yes, exactly. All men are guaranteed equal opportunity for freedom. The opportunity of education for all is the basis of this guarantee. Man needs knowledge to meet the conditions ahead. The conditions of an age of machinery. And then I realised about Percy. Then I said "I am going to have .." Jane. Hiram, you do look handsome. I was saving this finery to be laid out in. It will be a wonderful portrait. Jane, you took an unfair advantage of me. How can you say that? First, you tell me about the new addition and .. While I am in a state of overjoyed imbecility .. You exact from me a promise to submit to this indignity. Now don't get in a temper. Mr Magel is very nervous. Promise me you won't upset him. - Upset him? Madam, I would like to draw and quarter him. Percy, Percy! Please go down the back stairs and out in the yard and stay there. But I want to ask Papa something. You can ask him later. Now be a good boy. Now we get the pose. The head, so. The chin a little up. Good, good. The jacket, open. So. This hand on the arm of the chair. Relax. This hand over the watch chain. Very natural. Very strong. Good. Now, the light is too much so we .. bring the dark. The eye is very far away. Very mysterious. The creator in the shadows of the great pose. Maybe you are not the great thinker but .. My painting will be a painting of the great thinker. Move the chin. A little. Not so like I am. Please. Good. What is the meaning of this? Please. Well, if you are going to paint a picture, you need more light. That is only common sense. Ah, a connoisseur. Really? - A critic. I do think that one ear is .. - Get out. Get out! Get out! Magel doesn't need more light. The eyes over there. Good. It don't look much like Papa, does it. It is only the beginning. [ Whistling ] Please. The whistling I do not like it. Magel cannot stand the whistling. Ever. Good whistling is bad enough. Bad whistling is awful. Will you draw my picture too? Yes. Someday, but not now. Take him away. - His name is Skipper. Do you know why? - I do not care why. Go away, Skipper. Go away. Stand back. You are in my light. Okay Skipper. Go away. Mr Maxim. The pose. Now you can see him better, can't you. This is the end. A portrait painter for 25 years. But in this house everybody helps me with the light. Little boy, now you can see your father. No you can paint him too. Goodbye, Mr Maxim. You do not need Magel. You have a house full of portrait painters. He was excited, wasn't he. Yes. He was. What happened? Mr Magel and Percy had some differences about life. Isn't Mr Magel going to do your portrait? I'm afraid not. He left. I'm sure if I speak to him he'll come back. Come back? If he dares madam, I will leave. And on that you may take a vow. Papa. Please. Oh. Isn't it lovely. Beautiful, madam. Mr Maxim sent it from town. I am lucky to have Mr Maxim. There is some that's worse, ma'am. Come on, Skipper. Oh. There is Percy. Put it away where he won't see it. - Yes, ma'am. How many times have I told you not to use the front door? Now that you are in you can stay in. Your hat, Percy. - Yes, ma'am. What are you hiding from me? Me? Hiding something from you? That is just your imagination. No it isn't. You are hiding something. That is just nonsense. And I have no time to waste on nonsense. And don't east so many cookies. You'll spoil your supper. Mama. How do you like Skipper now? Skipper. Skipper. Come here. Don't you like it? Come here, Skipper. Skipper. Skipper, come here. - Skipper. Skipper, do you hear me? Skipper. You are a bad boy. Come out of there, sir. Come out of there right away. He won't come out, Mama. - Skipper. Come out. Skipper. Skipper, come out of there. Alright. I'll go in after you. Here he is, Mama. Percy. Call Emily. Are you alright, Mama? Yes. Get Emily quick. Emily! Emily! Mama wants you! Percy. What have you done to your mother? It was my fault, Papa. No it wasn't, son. Now Mama is sick and I can't tell her. Don't cry, boy. Mother told me how it all happened. She doesn't blame you at all. Does she blame Skipper? Skipper thought she was playing with him. Don't you worry now, son. Mother is going to be all better in no time at all. Look. Stay right here. How is Jane, doctor? There is a grave danger, Mr Maxim. I have sent for Dr Grant for consultation. We'll keep her under strong sedatives until he arrives. Can I go up to her now? Don't stay too long. And above all .. Don't let her see how much you are worried. Mr Maxim. The doctor said I could go in. - Not looking like that, sir. Please, her spirits are up. We have to keep her cheerful. I'll manage. Darling, I am glad you're here. I just got home and heard the big news. Have you seen Percy? For a minute. Is he alright? Oh, he is fine. Kinda mystified by all the activity. I think you had better send him over to cousin Garnet's. Alright. I'm glad she has gone. I want to tell you something. Doctor Fillmore is worried. No, Jane. - 0h, Hiram. I know he is. So are the nurses. So are you. You can't hide it from me. Jane. But I'm not. Not even a little bit. And I don't want you to be. Jane, there's nobody in the world like you. Oh yes there is. Every woman feels like this. Frightened, of course. But excited. Underneath the fear. Excited because of what this means to all of us. To you. To Percy. To me. And to somebody else. Is that good for fathers too? I bet it would be. Would you like to try some? No thank you. Just like his son. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight. Sorry I took so long, doctor. You are here now and we have a great deal to do before the night is over. Now, she is strong. But she doesn't quite realize how very bad the situation is. But that is all we have in our favor. Is Mama better now, Papa? The doctors will make her better, son. I think I'll take you over to your cousin Garnet's. Does Mama want me to go away? Just for tonight. She is angry with me? No she is not, Percy. I made her hurt herself. No you didn't. Please let me stay here with you, Papa. Until she gets better. Then I will go away. You are not going away at all. You are going to stay right here with me. You're not mad at me? Most certainly not. I am. I'm mad at me. Don't be. You are a good boy. Hello Mrs Allison. I just brought some chicken broth. I'll leave it in the kitchen. Thank you. How is she? No better. Then there is nothing we can do? Nothing but pray. Well, we are all doing that. [ Baby crying noises ] [ Baby crying noises ] Wait a minute. -(t-g)-
