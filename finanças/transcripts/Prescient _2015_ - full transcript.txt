Corneas are perfect. - I want Corneal implants. - There's nothing wrong with your eyes. There is. You just probably can't see with your equipment. (eerie music) (dramatic music) -[Walter]-What are you doing here, Theodore? -Is that who I think it is? -She's no longer your patient. -Is she yours now? -Why are you here? Things would have been very different if it weren't for her. (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) Thank you. - [Theodore]-So... - [Helen]- So... - Good news. - Okay. Your eggs have been successfully fertilized with your late husband's sperm. You requested twins. We have even better news. Identical twin girls. - I don't know how to thank you. - Oh, don't thank me. Identical twins are still God's creation and we're not quite there yet, but It's only a matter of time. Michael would - he would be so pleased. I just want to prepare you for this, but It seems your girls have inherited your husband's gene for cardiac hypertrophy. - He died at 35. - I realize that. Our company has a solution for this. Have you heard of the Universal Genome Program? A few samples of blood, skin and saliva... Yeah, I know what this is. By matching their genetic profiles with the millions on our database, we can predict their medical destiny, and soon technology will allow us to repair their future. Doctor? (eerie music) Doctor, are you alright? (eerie music) (eerie music) [water running] Shall I take over? How are we doing? -How is she? -Not looking good. Her doctor loses it in the middle of her examination. - It's not what you think. - Let me run your junk through the program. With my code. I could easily find you similar genetic profiles- Walter! Enough. You won't find me in the program. - What do you mean? Every employee submits their genome to the program. -I'm not an employee. (gentle music) Something's bothering you. -It's a patient. -It's bad news, huh? Have you told her? -No, it's fine. (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) - Hello? Yeah. Hey, hold on, I got to get a pen. Okay. Uh-huh, I know where it is. What time? Okay. Helen, Don't forget what I said yesterday. -Hi, good morning. Hey. - What are you doing? - Who was that? - It was Walter. - It's Walter? It's Saturday. - He's a workaholic. Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm... What are you doing in my robe, huh? You haven't asked me to move in yet. I have no clothes. (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) - Hey, Em. - [Emma] He's flying back from London tonight. I don't know what is going to happen. I'm really scared. (car engine) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) [Voice-over] 911, what's your emergency? -[Theodore] -I'd like to report a shooting. -[Voice-over] Is it happening now? - [Theodore] No, but it will. An hour from now. Parker Pharmacy. Hertel and Saranac. -[Voice-over] What's your name, sir? Has anyone been hurt? -That's okay, sir. I'll take care of that. [elevator dings] What is your firm's most valuable asset? Equities? Fixed incomes? Commodities? Human capital. Employ the absolute brightest, the most responsible. Make them stay. -They say if you want loyalty, get a dog. Supposedly no such thing in this business. Karl's quite the exception. Stellar performer. Been with us five years. Do you want to know why? We don't discriminate. -Soon you might have to, Miss Freeman. Hiring practices have grown increasingly sophisticated over the years. And with all due respect, what your company does is quite...it's outdated. We've done an analysis on a genetic profile of someone who works here. -Yes, of course. 20% likelihood of Parkinson's, 15% Alzheimerâ€™s 30% OCD, 68% ADD- -I get it. Who are we talking about? How dare you? Is this even legal? - [Theodore] Well, it's... - [Walter] We merely interpret the data. We interpret it for you. - What I meant was is it legal for you? Doctors. (door opens, closes) - What does she not get? We're already screening embryos and cells. You okay? What's up with you in there? - We blew it, alright? It's no big deal. - Yeah. It is when you have child support. Right. All in the name of Lydia. -Screw you! What is it you think you know about being a father? (phone rings) (clears throat) - Walter speaking. -[Ms. Freeman] Dr. Hamilton, We're interviewing next week. Why don't you and your partner drop by? -Stop the car. [Ms. Freeman] Are you still there, Doctor? I said stop the car! (police scanner) (police scanner) Excuse me, sir, this is a crime investigation. (eerie music) -[Officer] Hey, hey, hey, we've got a doctor coming in! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (dramatic music) (police sirens) (police scanner) (police scanner) [Voice-over] Shooting at a local pharmacy has left one person dead. The victim was identified as Anna Lee. The suspect was apprehended shortly afterwards. (gentle music) (gentle music) (seagulls cawing) (seagulls cawing) (seagulls cawing) (gentle music) (footsteps) (footsteps) (footsteps) -I just knew I would find you here. We used to come here to pray when you saw things. -764 days. -Is it really that long? -Why did we stop coming here, Aunt Kay? -You grew up, you... became a doctor, became obsessed with finding the cure. - Half of all genetic disorders are inherited. What were they like, my parents? Can't you acknowledge that there are still some things in God's hands? - I know. The cause may be genetic, but the solution doesn't have to be. I can just remove what's causing the problem. (gentle music) (gentle music) - I want Corneal implants. - There's nothing wrong with your eyes. - I get visions. Visions of the imminent future. - (laughs) Excuse me? If we were to lock eyes, and you were going to die in the next 24 hours, I'd see your final moments. - Go someplace else. I'm not going to lose my license over your magical story. (door opens, closes) - [Walter]-Hey. (laughs) You are here. How are you doing? Hungry? I'll take you to lunch. No, thanks. I've already eaten. You can watch me eat. Come on. (seagulls cawing) -[Theodore] Why are we here? - Why weren't you at the funeral? I thought you were going to buy me lunch. Here. Very generous of you. I was just starting to get hungry. What happened the other night at the pharmacy? - It's over. They found the shooter. - I searched your computer. I found a ton of research on genetic para-normality. Whatever it is you're trying to find, whatever it is you're trying to hide, It's got something to do with Helen, the shooting. and Anna. - [Walter] Who else knows about this? -[Theodore] My Aunt Kay. - Not even Anna? You don't trust her, do you? -It's not about trust. Then why'd you keep it from her? -Why'd I keep it from her? Why did I keep it from you? Why did I keep it from everyone? - Have you tried neuroleptics? - For God's sake, Walter. These aren't hallucinations. - You have no idea what it feels like to be running from this your entire life. To know what's like, to look inside someone's eyes and know they are going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it. You stopped Helen from dying. You altered her future. Theodore, you played God. You're capable of either a lot of good, or a hell of a lot of bad. -[Theodore] The Panopticon. - 18th century prison. - [Walter] Never heard of it. England's answer to controlling hundreds of inmates through the eyes of a single watchman from a tower in the center. He sees everything, knows everything, but he's alone. Didn't take him too long to figure out who the true prisoner is. - Why did you become a doctor? Because you enjoy self-medication? Change of perspective. Better to bring life into this world than to watch it go away. -Join the program. I'm sure you'll find other freaks just like you. -Board-certified geneticist claims to see the future. That sound right to you? - What's the worst that could happen? -They blacklist me. Revoke my license. Might as well give up on finding the prescient gene. (gentle dramatic music) (gentle dramatic music) (gentle music) (gentle music) - Here. enroll me in the program. (gentle music) -[Theodore] I came here to give you this. -You're quitting? - You can keep my share. You probably need it more than me. - Read the papers? - I don't read too well these days. (eerie music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (panting) (gentle music) (gentle music) (eerie music) (eerie music) -[Theodore] Anna? - She was my sister. - Emma. Of course. How are you? -I'm alright. (sighs) You knew there was going to be a shooting that night, didn't you? -I didn't know she'd show up. (gentle music) (gentle music) Emma. - It was nice meeting you. (heartbeat) - Whoa. Are you okay? What's wrong? - If it wasn't for you, my sister would still be alive. -[Theodore] Seeing her felt like Anna survived. - But she didn't survive. Where are you going with this? What did she want? - [Theodore] She didn't say. She just left. -[Aunt Kay] Something is not right. - What do you mean? - [Aunt Kay] You never even met her sister, and suddenly she appears? -[Theodore] That's why I followed her. -[Helen]- Hey. - [Emma]-Hey. - Sorry I'm horribly late. I'm sorry. - [Aunt Kay] Why are you doing this? It's not your fault that your girlfriend was in the wrong place at the wrong time. - [Theodore]- She thought I was cheating on her. - You don't know that. When your parents passed on I wanted you to find love, have a family. But the girl you fell in love with is gone. You can't just replace her with her sister. - [Theodore]- Anna? - Go to bed, Aunt Kay. Everything is going to be alright in the morning. (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) - So, what brings you here? - Tell me what you know about Emma. (Helen clears throat) A year after Michael passed, I joined a support group. We have a new member with us here today. She has also lost someone very dear to her. Tell us, Emma. What happened? - Hi. My sister was killed in the pharmacy shooting a month ago. (eerie music) And the police called me to tell me she's dead. I didn't understand. I mean... - [Helen]- I couldn't believe she was sitting in my support group. What is it? - I wish it was me who got shot that night. Should have been. -[Theodor] -What did she mean by that? [Helen] Survivor's guilt, maybe. - Is that why you befriended her? - You know the answer to that. - Did you tell her you were the one- - Of course not. How do you tell someone that you are alive because someone they love is dead? That your... your destiny was... substituted? Somehow I had assumed you'd stopped it. You have to find a way to move on. You... you can't keep living in the past. - Look, Helen... There's something you need to know. The woman who took your place was someone I was seeing. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - You still haven't told me why she was here. - [Helen] It's about her husband. [eerie music] [Voice-over] -Hey, it's Emma, leave a message Listen, it's me. We need to talk... [voice-over] -The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye. [eerie music] [eerie music] [water running] [doorbell rings] [thunder and wind] - [Nurse] Dr.Meridian called to say he'll be in late. - Did he say why? -[Nurse]-Just asked if you would cover his appointments. [eerie music] [door closes] -[Emma] -Sorry. I had nowhere else to go. -What happened? My husband thinks that 9laughs0 my lover is here to fuck me 'cause some guy rang the doorbell and just vanished. [screaming] [screaming] It's been, what? A month? I really miss her, you know. When my sister died, I felt it right here. It's like my artery tore the moment the bullet ripped through her heart. I still feel it sometimes. How did you know there was going to be a shooting that night? -I know you're still trying to come to terms with what happened. Believe me, I'm trying to do the same. The night before she died, I saw her eyes, they were calm, peaceful. I know this is going to sound crazy, but... I knew someone was going to die the day before, and I knew there was absolutely no way she was going to die the next day. -I think I need a drink. [pouring] Thank you. [gentle music] - I'm sorry. You look just like her. [sighs] - On the morning of the shooting I was on the phone with my sister. She said that her husband was coming back from London that night. They'd gotten into this huge fight before he left, and she was really worried that he was going to hit her again. [eerie music] I didn't know how bad it was. She never told me. But I wanted to protect her. -(Anna) Hey, remember this game we used to play? Listen, I'll do it for you. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] - [Emma] So I told my sister maybe I should take her place. Wait, wait. What are you saying? - I'm so sorry. - Who died in my arms? I'm so sorry, I was the one that sent my sister to the pharmacy. I should have been the one dead. - Anna? I thought you were dead for a long- - I'm sorry, Theo, I'm sorry. - What were you thinking? I wasn't thinking, I wasn't thinking, I just wasn't thinking. -Your family! Your family thinks- look at me. Look at me, look at me. Your family thinks you're dead. - I know. I know. - You had a goddamn funeral. - I know. I know. I know. - You had a funeral. -You weren't at my funeral, Theo. -Why, Why, why are you trying to be your sister? I thought it would make the pain go away because it was... it was just... It was just hurting so much. - Why didn't you tell me? - I couldn't do it anymore. -Why didn't, Shh! - I couldn't do it anymore.I couldn't. -Why didn't you tell me? - Why didn't you tell me? - I couldn't tell you. If I told you, you wouldn't let me go through with this. I couldn't tell you. - You're with Karl! You're with Karl! You're with-- That's fucked up! That's fucked up! -Theo, listen to me, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But Karl is a really sick man. He did some really horrible things to my sister, and I really need to do this for her. I didn't help her when she was alive but I can help her now. I need to make him pay for this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (crying) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (crying) I'm sorry. -It's crazy. How can anybody live like that? Do you trust her? -I... I'm not sure. [eerie music] -What's the problem? -Like I said, I don't read too well these days. - It says "Freak accident in Wescott building", asshole. What the hell happened yesterday? - You killed a man. - That's not how I would put it. -How would you put it? And could you look me in the eye? - Please finish that. - I'm really not that hungry. - If you don't finish that, I won't take you to the museum. - [Lydia] Uncle Theo! - Hey. Are you joining us? Why not? We're going to chat for a few minutes, Uncle Theo and I. I expect that to be done by the time we get back. See? Mmm... Mmm... yummy. Finish that, please. -See ya, kiddo. Brilliant parenting. -Tell me that when you have kids of your own. - Seeing how you treat yours makes me not want to have any. - (laughs) This morning, very responsible of you to walk out on your patients. Listen, I was going through the profiles of Freeman Capital Why don't we have current employees? - We only screen the new batch of hires. - You should scan current employees. It's the future of the business. Well, is your idea of the future rampant layoffs and broken families. - We're not the firing squad. - You're always going on about money. This could be a cash cow. -You got something against one of their employees? (screaming) - Why would you say that? - Is this another one of your predictions? What if you're wrong? -I'm never wrong. -Did you see Anna's death the night before she died? [dramatic music] - I've out-performed every other trader. - I'm not hearing a question, Karl. -I've made a ton of money for this firm. for you. - All I'm asking is that... - No. We've been through this before. [gentle music] [elevator bell dings] [gentle music] [gentle music] - [Walter] Whatchya working on? - [Theodore] A patient. -Someone like... Emma Palmer? - What makes you think that? - Well, I saw the Palmers at the funeral. Whatever is going on with Mrs. Palmer I suggest you end it. You don't know what he's done to her. I know what she's done to you. -She's a victim of domestic violence. -So? You think by helping her you could make it up to her sister. But Anna's dead, and there is nothing you can... For someone who claims to see the future, you're spending an awful lot of time living in your past. [water dripping] [gentle music] [gentle music] [gentle music] [gentle music] - [Nurse] Dr.Meridian? Your new patient is here to see you. -Have her wait in my office. Thank you. - [Anna] What happens to your instincts when you needed them the most? - Can't hurt to have a little objectivity. - [Anna] Or be completely blinded by it. What are you doing here, Anna? I've got a present for you. Who's the father? [gentle music] [gentle music] -[Walter]- Okay. Just a little pinch. Ready? Band-aid. Okay, put it right on there. [dramatic music] [camera snapping] [camera snapping] [rain falling] [rain falling] - [Ms. Freeman] What do you have for me, doctor? 45% OCD, 72% kleptomania, 88% violence. An overwhelmingly high number of indicators suggest psychopathic behaviors This man does not belong inside any investment firm. [phone vibrating] - [Ms. Freeman] Yes, Karl. Okay. So... who are we talking about? Him. -He's one of our best. What does your boss think? -Well, the data doesn't lie. With a genetic profile like his, there is a very high possibility he will commit fraud, if he hasn't already. -How certain are you? -We're all prisoners of our genes. -You said he was one of your best. -Makes a killing. Every time a stock tanks. -Or the whole market crashes. -That's unbelievable. Are you...saying you can see the future, or... [Dramatic music] -Still searching for a match? -What were you trying to find? Forget it. I found my man. Just like me, he sees the future. Karl Palmer. I bet you he has a prescient gene, too. You can stop the search. -Well, you had it on overnight. Saw your parameters. What were you looking for? - Anyone with a similar genetic profile of mine. Why? Why? [dramatic music] (dramatic music) (Water flowing) - [Theodore] Who's Cooper McCaffrey? - Where is this coming from? - You told me my parents died in a car accident when I was one. So, who's Cooper McCaffrey? He didn't die, did he? -He didn't care about you. He didn't love you. -How could you lie to me? That's why you never wanted me to join the program, wasn't it? Who the hell's Meridian? - I wanted to protect you. Meridian is something I made up 30 years ago. You think that was gonna stop me finding him? -It was to stop him from finding you. You're not my mother. What gave you the right? [eerie music] [eerie music] [eerie music] [knocking] - Sir? It's you! [dramatic music] What do you want? Are you Cooper McCaffrey? Are you from that genome Program? [Cooper] Beer? - No thanks. -Come on, I already opened it. -No, really -Well... Are you still here with good news about my son? Did you find him? -We've narrowed it down to three. At this point, what's left is just to cross-check some data. Could you describe the circumstances under which you lost your son? - It's been such a long time. -So long that you've forgotten him? This was the last time I saw him. He was a pretty ordinary kid, other than one weird... His mother said he saw things. Things that you and I can't see. Terrible things. What did he see? I guess he was about a year old when it happened. Took a road-trip winter '77. You cried the whole way, the moment we put him in the car. I guess that was his way of telling us, Bur how would we know? Next thing I know, bam, we're skidding off the road down to a ravine. His momma, my Jane, went into a coma. I loved her so much. She never woke up. I can--I can still hear his crying in my head. So, uh... [crying] I left him. I regretted it even since. He looks happy. Used to be. Why after all these years did- [eerie music] What's wrong with your eyes? [dramatic music] [dramatic music] (panting) [crying] [phone vibrating] [phone vibrating] [phone vibrating] - [Walter] Results are in. The kid's yours. A daughter, congratulations. Welcome to my world. Are you okay? Check for unauthorized trades, fake accounts, unusual transactions, anything, that warrants a second look for fraudulent activity. - [Karl's assistant] -They're going through everything. - [Karl] -Just do as I say and everything's gonna be fine. [Karl's assistant] -I'm not doing time for fraud, Karl. - [Anna]- Karl's gonna bolt, Switzerland. And he thinks the baby is his. [Theodore] -Oh good. It worked. Either he leaves or he's doing time. - [Anna]- That's not good enough. Do you remember what it was like before any of this? When it was just you and me? Theo, we can't go back to the past, how can you possibly think that? Isn't it enough that he just died? -If you wanted him dead, you would have done it already. Killing isn't in your genes. There's a right time for everything. - And a right person. Me. So you don't get your hands dirty, is that it? [gentle music] It's late, what are you doing here? During the last month, all I ever thought about were two things. What I'd do to get things back to how they were with Anna and all. And what I'd do to isolate and destroy the gene responsible for this mess. I see your predicament. If Carl indeed has the prescient gene, without him, you may never find a cure for your condition. -Does she know that? -She doesn't care. -All she wants to do is kill him. -(laughs) -Yeah, well, not a good idea. What's the alternative? -I kill him. - Hey, baby! Karl? Karl? [footsteps] [footsteps] [footsteps] [footsteps] [door bell rings] [footsteps] [footsteps] [door bell rings] [knocking] [door bell rings] [knocking] We have a warrant for the arrest of Karl Palmer. He's accused of committing fraud, embezzlement, and security violations at Freeman capital. [crickets chirping] [crickets chirping] [eerie music] We're closed, Mr. Palmer. -[Karl] -My wife, why did she come and see you? -There's been some kind of mistake. -I know she was here. And I know she's pregnant. I have a right to know about my child. I'm sorry. We have client confidentiality. (Karl laughs) I've seen your file. You're manic, violent. Prone to neurosis. It's not your fault. You're a victim of your genes. You blame it on my genes? [laughing] I asked you a simple question. - I know how you timed your trades and beat the market. But how is it you can predict the future? Who the hell told you that? We're alike. I see it with my eyes. Are you seeing anything right now? (groaning) Analysis was right. You're obsessively vain. -Alright asshole, I'm asking you one last time. Why did she come to see you?!! - (groans) It ain't your child. [groaning] [dramatic music] - [Ophthalmologist] -Finally got his wish, didn't he? -What wish? -Corneal implants. - He's going to be able to see again, right? Depends. Get him home. Let him rest. Keep the bandages on for 24 hours. (birds chirping) [phone beeps] -Time. -[Voice-over] The time is 8:46 AM. [gentle music] So you're no longer prescient? - I don't think so. I bet you'd love to know how I did it. - Why'd you do it? Because of what he did to you? Or what he did to her? -Neither. But I know you would've done the same. [dramatic music] - [Anna] Theo? Theo, what are you doing? You can't take them off. -I've got to go. -Why? -Just take me to the car. Where are you going? Alright. You drive. [gentle music] [eerie music] [eerie music] [knocking] - [Anna] Theo, be careful! Wait! [knocking] Cooper! He's not in. -We're too late. -What? Freeman Capital. Theo! - Why, Karl? -I can't help it. They tell me it's in my genes. Five years I've slaved my life for you Now, you set the dogs on me. I've notified my bank at Switzerland. You've got ten minutes! - [Theo] Cooper! Stay away from the elevator! Stay, stay. - I know that look in your eyes. Who are you? [elevator bell dings] [dramatic music] [typing] - What makes you think you'll get away with this? It's all client money. - Don't worry, I'm only taking your share. [knocking] [elevator bell rings] [dramatic music] - The elevator will crash. - Don't try to stop me. -Karl will live. and you will die. your daughter will die. [gentle music] I'll take care of it. Trust me. [dramatic music] - Well, what are you waiting for? [elevator bell rings] - [Theo] Palmer! - What are you doing here? Stay back! I said stay back. We've got one of two ways to do this. Let's try the easy one first. Turn yourself in. Well, perhaps finding out the truth about your wife will change things. - What truth? Do you remember who your wife was? Ever ask yourself who she is now? Whoever you think is waiting for you down there in the lobby, she's not who she used to be. Your wife, your real wife, was killed in the shooting. She died in my arms, leaving her sister with nothing but grief and vengeance. You poisoned her soul. She will kill you. Even if it means she dies too. That's the truth you deserve to know. - And you're here to save me? I'm not falling for it. My wife is pregnant. We're having a baby. [dramatic music] We should back up. [dramatic music] -[Voice-over] -The substitution of one life for another, again. [gentle music] My quest for the elusive prescient gene has taught me one thing. Science has its limitations. [gentle music] Ironically, the future has never been so unclear. So uncertain. [dramatic music] So unpredictable. [police scanner] [police scanner] -So you did it for your daughter? [gentle music] Sometimes, we need to take the risk of being a bad person before we could become a good one. I was once told for someone who sees the future, I spend an awful lot of time living in the past. I figured it was time to move on. Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha
