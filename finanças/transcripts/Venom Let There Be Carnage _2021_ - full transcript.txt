They can't do that. [BREATH TREMBLING] They can't take you from me. You're my one bright light. I will always love you! CLETUS: Frances! [GRUNTS] FRANCES [GRUNTING]: Get off! Frances! CLETUS: No! No!

MULLIGAN: Well, that's too bad, because he only wants to see you. Though, in my opinion, you had your chance with Kasady and you blew it. Right, um, so... what does he want? Maybe he wants to spill the beans about where the missing bodies are buried. So you're gonna have to do the right thing for a change. [GRUNTS SOFTLY] [VENOM SNARLS] VENOM: No! Take your tiny hands off of me! We should be out there protecting the city lethally! - [VENOM SNARLS] - [CLATTERING] [SNARLS] What was that? Unhand me! Man should never consent to crawl when he has the impulse to fly. You are a bottom-feeder. [WHISPERS] Be quiet. How many times have I told you that I want you to hide yourself when I am working? I am serious. It is important. You have to show me respect. - Respect? Respect? - Yes. Yes. - Okay. - Okay. Kasady gonna give you the scoop, right? - Right. - Wrong. - What do you mean? - Because you blow everything. Oh, okay, I see. You're talking about Anne again. I miss her! I will do it.

I mean, why am I here? Do a man who's buried alive a kindness, won't you? Get a message out to all my... fans. And in return, I'll give you my life. What? Story. I heard the written word hasn't been working out so well. Piece like this, an exclusive... [CLEARS THROAT] ...would put you back on top. Go on. People love... serial killers. All my secrets laid bare, Eddie. So much carnage. But why me? [LAUGHS] I like you. All right, it's a deal. [CLEARS THROAT] What's your message? [PAPER RUSTLING] That distant cathedral - is all I see... - Mm-hmm. ...fractured angel the other part of me. Print that in your column. Is that it? This, um... Who's gonna...

EDDIE [WHISPERS]: What are you doing? VENOM: Your job for you. CLETUS: Eddie. Don't forget me, Eddie. [COUGHS, SNIFFS] What did you get? Uh, I got a headache and probably got tuberculosis. What? A little louder. [CHUCKLES] He read me poetry, man. Is this some kind of joke to you, Eddie? Because I'm not laughing. VENOM: Yeah, you could do with a laugh. Come on, man. These things, they just take a little time, all right? Well, the second he gives you something... Of course. Keep me ahead of the curve, Eddie. - Don't embarrass me. - All right. - [ENGINE STARTS] - Do you understand? EDDIE: Trust me, the only scoop I'm getting today is double chocolate chip. VENOM: No! I get brain freeze. [ENGINE REVS, TIRE SQUEALS] VENOM: Come here. Look. - I'm looking. - Grab those. All right. Whoa. Okay.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER] REPORTER: Would you say your friendship with Cletus Kasady is what allowed you to solve this decades-old mystery? You are the only person from the outside world he's spoken with. Seems he likes you. Well, you know, he's a serial killer. I don't see how he can like anyone. REPORTER [VOICE-OVER]: Brock was able to uncover what the FBI and police could not. Bowing to public outrage, the governor of California has overturned his moratorium and reinstated the death penalty for Kasady. [SHRIEKING] [YELLING] Brock's career has been given a much-needed revival, putting him back on top once more. [ENGINE REVVING] [NEWS THEME PLAYS] REPORTER 2: A harrowing story finally comes to an end. Vindication for the victims and closure for the families. Thanks to the diligence of one man. - Thank you, Eddie Brock. - VENOM: And Venom. You know, this could be us, Eddie. Going out there, solving cases, fighting bad guys. Maybe I eat them, hmm? And then we save the day. EDDIE: But we saved the day. It's done. [YELLS] You said I could eat bad guys! - [SNARLING] - This again? I need to be free, feeling the wind in my hair and the sand between my toes. You don't have any hair. You are not listening to me. Oh, I'm listening. I cannot live like this anymore. - I'm starving. - So eat those guys. - VENOM: I can't. - [CHICKENS CLUCKING] Sonny and Cher are best friends. EDDIE: Are you serious? That's ridiculous. That's what... [YELLS, GROANS] Man, that was abusive. That was abuse. [GRUNTS] And that's a $2,000 TV. You have got to get control of your aggression. That is why we have Snookie! I cannot live on chicken and chocolate alone. I need brains. Chickens have brains. I most passionately disagree. Look. Look at those poor idiots. [CHICKENS CLUCKING] Small brains. Come on, man, it's not their fault that you, uh... you live on the old phenylethyla... - laphenylethylan. - Phenylethylalanine. Yeah, I just... I just said that. I've told you a thousand times, - because it is only found... - Yeah? - ...in brains and in chocolate. - And in chocolate. That's right. All right, well, how about this? You live in my body, you live by my rules. - I live in your body because... - Why? ...unfortunately, I don't have many options. Well, how about this, son? The FBI is still investigating us for all of that stuff that "we were involved with," so if one more head goes missing, we will get hauled off into Area 51. They will kill us both. So somebody has to be responsible. Responsibility... it's for the mediocre. - Food! - Can you stop doing that? - Food! Food! - Please just stop doing that now. - Come on, stop doing that. - Food! - I have a deadline! Will you... - Food...! Goddamn it! Fine!

I've been keeping my mouth shut, - feeding your little secret. - Wow. Little old Mrs. Chen is a little old blackmailer, huh? Less of the old. I am 39. - VENOM: And I am Barry Manilow. - Right. VENOM: I am happy to eat Mrs. Chen. No, no, you cannot eat Mrs. Chen. - What? - Well, I guess it's gonna have to be plan B. What's plan B? - Aah! Not this again! - [CHICKENS CLUCKING] I need human brains to survive. EDDIE: Uh-uh. Now, pick up some chickens, man. Let's go.

Leave him be! - [SCREAMING] - I shall remove your head. - EDDIE: No, you won't. - I will use it for bowling! - No, you will not. VENOM: I will take it to... What is the one that we like, Eddie? EDDIE: It's Lucky Strike. - Yes! Lucky Strike! - EDDIE: Put him down! I will take you to Lucky Strike, and I will score a 300-point game. - EDDIE: You won't. - The rest of your pudgy little - boy body will be left here... - [MUGGER WHIMPERING] ...rolling around in dumpster juice. - EDDIE: Oh, God. - [SNARLS] No!

There is a difference. [PHONE RINGING] VENOM: It is Anne. - Anne is on the phone, Eddie! - [EDDIE GASPS, WHIMPERS] Hey, Anne. ANNE: Hey, E-Eddie. Hi. - Hi. - VENOM: Be nice to her. ANNE: You sound out of breath. I'm-I'm not catching you at a bad time, am I? No, no, not at all. I'm just, uh... - I'm just hanging around. - Okay. Uh, I'm-I'm sorry I haven't returned your calls. I guess... I just needed a little space after the whole... alien biting a guy's head off thing, so... VENOM: Ah, the good old days. Anyway, so I have some news, and-and I was wondering if we could meet. - VENOM: Yes! - Yeah, sure, that would be, uh... That would be fine. Great. Okay, great. Uh, how's tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? Yeah, great. - 8:00? - L'Araignée? - Okay, great. - Looking forward to it. Oh... Yeah, okay. Me, too. Bye. Great. VENOM: It's over with the doctor!

You know, he's still wiping his ass on the carpet. - He learned that from you. - [CHUCKLES] Yeah, how-how's, uh... how's the legal aid work going? Well, you know how much I love an underdog, so... Yeah. Yeah, that's why you... put up with me for so long, huh? You said it. - S-So... - So... VENOM: So? I don't know, I-I thought it would be better to tell you in person that... Uh-huh. VENOM: No! Wow. Oh, Anne. Wow, that is, uh... that is so much bigger than the... the one that I got you. VENOM: Ugh, it's gaudy. That's Dan, right? Doc-Doctor Dan. Yeah, that... it's Dan. Holy shit, Anne. Way to go. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. - VENOM: Well, I am not okay. - Yeah. You could just say, "Congratulations. I'm happy for you." You know, like two people who still care enough about each other to lie so that the other one doesn't feel like complete shit. I... Maybe we could do that version of this? No, I am... I am happy for you, Anne. - You know, I'm, uh... - VENOM: No. Congratulations. Thank you. VENOM: That was going to be us, Eddie. I, for one, would not be inconsolable if Dan were to fall into traffic and lose his head and his feet - and all of his teeth! - What? What was that? What? Nothing. Whoa. If I ask you a question, do you have the ability to tell me the truth? You mean as in being super happy for you because of your engagement? Because, I mean, you just told me to lie, so that's really, really confusing. Is Venom with you? He's dead. VENOM: I am. I'm playing dead right now. Yeah, I mean, he... - Right. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Well, that's... You just don't change, do you? What are you talking about? This is just a... It's a huge shock. Um, I'm in... Anne, I'm in love with you. This is a lot to process. No, the truth is you don't love anybody. You can't. Commitment's just not your thing. All right, then, fine. Do not marry Dan. - Dan makes me feel safe. - Ugh. Okay, and you made me feel like I was on a roller coaster. And sometimes you just have to know when to get off. - Yeah, and not yak. - VENOM: And not yak! You know, not yak. Yak. ANNE: Hey, Venom. Take care of him, all right? Don't let him keep messing everything up. VENOM: I'm going to make you cry now, Eddie. She will love it. Cry. Cry. It's a lot to process. [GRUNTS] Congratulations, Anne. It's great news. [HORN HONKING] [TIRES SQUEAL] VENOM: Slow down, pal. EDDIE: Why? You don't believe in consequences. No injuries. You fix them. No hangovers. You mend them. I couldn't even hurt myself if I tried. - [HORN HONKING] - [TIRES SQUEALING] VENOM: Eddie, I apologize that I can't mend the heart. Emotional pain, it hits much harder, and it lasts longer. You just need to pull up your big-boy pants and take it. Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say. Why? Because I'm a real boy and you're just an amoeba.

You and I are the same. No. No, we're not. Twisted insides, mean daddies. You feel like home to me, Eddie, like family. And really, truly, that is all I ever wanted in this world. Family. Well, killing your grandmother and your mother sure is a funny way of showing it. Anything you want to unburden yourself with before... ...um, this happens? Yes. I have wishes to bestow upon you.

No, you don't think about things like that, do you? You just think about chickens, you think about you, you think about what you want, and you think about you. Let me remind you of something, Eddie. You were a loser before I came along. You were nothing. I made you special. Oh, you made me special, huh? Well, let me tell you something, right? Before you came along, I had a life. I didn't have chickens, all right? But I had dreams. Yeah, I had dreams, and I had a fiancée, and I had a really successful TV show! Ah, but you destroyed all of those things by yourself. Yeah, but you know what? I rebuilt my life, and now I just want to live it. Good night. And how did you build this new life? - Hmm? - Excuse me? Well, who found the clue on the wall so you could be this big, shiny hero? Hmm? Who found the clue? - Who? - Wow. Yeah. No, no, no. This is not about being a hero for me, man. This is about wanting to live in peace. D-Do you understand what I'm talking about? No, you don't. You don't understand what I'm talking about. Okay, this is about me wanting to live without you whining in my ear all the time about eating bad guys or, like, nagging me about Anne or destroying my place or destroying my life! Do you know how lucky you are that I chose you? You chose me? Buddy, I'm the only person that took you in when your friends kicked you off the planet Ming Mong 'cause you are a reject!

Nothing at all. Nothing about an escape plan? Nothing about some kind of elaborate breakout costume?

And, uh, it didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but, um, I'm here at St. Estes, and I found this, uh... Well, I'm standing in front of a... of a... of a tree, and I'm-I'm looking at it. It's, uh... it's got a carving on it. It says "CK loves FB." I'm thinking that maybe whoever this FB is might know where he's headed. And, uh... a-and if you can, I don't know, pull up some files from St. Estes, maybe you can figure out who this FB is. FB, that's, uh... that's Frances Barrison. Wow. That-that's quick.

I'm just wasting your time. Well, you know what I keep thinking? I keep thinking, "What else is Eddie Brock "not sharing about Cletus Kasady? "Now, why was it Eddie that Cletus wanted to witness the execution?" Huh? Bad things happen around you. Multiple dead bodies at your building last year, that bizarre outburst at the lobster restaurant, and only you at the Life Foundation when that rocket exploded. And now Clyde's found Bonnie, and there's a dead psychiatrist at a facility I knew nothing about until today. And people are talking about seeing monsters. Monsters? Uh, what-what do you mean... - what do you mean, "monsters"? - Monsters, Eddie! Everywhere Cletus goes, so goes this supposed monster. - Oh, God. - Talk to me, Eddie. - [EDDIE GROANS] - Talk to me! [SCREAMS] MULLIGAN: How's he doing it, Eddie? [VOICE-OVER] What's the secret? How's he making people see things? All right, I, uh...

How much do I need to worry about you right now? Uh, I-I messed up. Okay. How badly? Uh, it couldn't be worse, and it's-it's all on me. Whatever you did, Eddie, you just need to tell the cops the truth. No. No. No, I can't tell them that they are chasing a serial killer [WHISPERING] who's also got an alien inside of him. And he's capable of killing everybody. Venom. Talk to me. What's happening? No, he's-he's not here. He's not here. Is this, like, an "I'm lying" "He's not here," or is this a real "He's not here"?

You want to break his heart, too? I'm not gonna get into who did what to who. Eddie said that he might be here because of the chocolate. I-I just need to speak with the alien. Wha... Hey, you said there weren't gonna be any aliens. - I meant more aliens. - REPORTER: Breaking news. The mayor has issued a curfew... Can you turn the volume up, please? REPORTER: Kasady and Barrison should be treated as armed and extremely dangerous. An all-out manhunt continues tonight. [MUTES TV] So? - Cletus has a symbiote. - DAN: Oh, my God. Any other information you're pathologically lying about? - Pussy. - Excuse me? Eddie needs Venom. She just called me a pussy. He said he didn't need him, that life was better without him. Okay, I don't understand. What do you care... Oh, wait a second. You get out here right now. [GASPS] Do you... D-Do you see that? - Seriously, do you see that? - Yeah, hon, I've seen it.

VENOM: We're not doing shit until he apologizes. So, he's looking for an apology. Look, I know that amends aren't - really your thing, but... - EDDIE: An apology? What, like, as in right... right now, an apology? VENOM: I need him to beg. Fine, I will be the bigger of us. VENOM: I will always be the bigger of us, but go on. What did he say? What is he saying? He said he's listening very sincerely. All right, listen to this. I am sorry. VENOM: Not the right tone. I'm sorry. VENOM: Nope. I-I am sorry. So weird. I'm sorry! I don't know why you're shouting at me. Well, 'cause... Okay, well, fine. I was a... I was a loser before I met you. - VENOM: Yep. That's right. - And, uh... and now I am someone. All right?
