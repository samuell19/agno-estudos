Do you believe in witches? Do you believe that they will give up being a witch for love? Meet Barbra, the witch of every man's dreams. But that was eight years ago. Since dating a kid-at-heart named Sam, she has lost her powers. Now, her life is dedicated to taking care of him. I've been waiting for half an hour. Let's go. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Here's your oyster congee. Enjoy your meal. Mister! The scallions? I'll take them. Their love story isn't anything epic. Sharing showers, removing scallions, and wiping beer bottles with napkins. But that's love. What more do you want? Hand me the towel, please. Get it yourself. Hurry up. It stinks! I can't reach it. - Come on. Hurry. - Take it yourself. I can't go over there. - Give me a hand. - While they were dating, Barbra was a champion of a sport called Mixed Breakup Singles. Is it good? Yes. How is this different from yesterday's meal? The bacon was too fatty. And the bread? The bread? It's okay. Do you know where I bought the bread? Do you know how much was that? Do you know long I waited in line? I went at dawn. It cost 45 dollars. And it's just okay? Get off that thing! THE 17TH BREAKUP Just so you know, we broke up. I just came to see if you're still alive. Quit the wet puppy look. I'll take you to the doctor, then I'll leave you there. Let me remind you, we already broke up. THE 58TH BREAKUP - I'm ready to go. - Which do you think is better? Spin around. This one. Let's go. What's wrong with this one? It's fine, too. But I like this color. Maybe we should just shower and go to bed. I can't stand your attitude! Let's break up. Every time they break up, only when Sam gives in will Barbra agree to make up. This makes Barbra sound evil, but when Sam said he wanted to open this cafe, Barbra quit her job and found a space even though she had told him off. And who am I? I'm the cafe. My name is La... Sorry, I don't speak French. It means "I love you." As to why I look like this on my first day... It's all because of these bad influences. Last night, they had too much fun. Hurry and tidy up. A dead body! Over there. Thanks to our coffee maker, we can open for business. Let's get working! Are you open? Yes. Today is our first day. Thanks. - May I sit here? - Sure. What is the name of this cafe? It's called La Je T'aime. - A French place. - Yes. Then I'd like a French toast and a latte. What's wrong? The shop's coffee machine broke. This is from home. The Four Boys are not in here. - How can we do business? I'll talk to him. - Calm down. It's our first day. Why turn down business? Make his coffee. It'll be fine. I'll handle this. I got an idea. Go make his coffee. Priscilla's Eatery. Yes. One very French, French toast. Anything else? Address, please? Po Hing Fong. That's close by, about ten minutes. The back entrance? Mr. Three, one French toast takeout. Who orders French toast in the morning? We're busy. Tell him to call back at tea time. Yes! Who orders French toast so early? I'll make it myself. Tam. Delivery to Po Hing Fong. Thanks. I'm busy. Fine. I'll deliver it myself. It's here. - You ordered French toast? - Yes, how much? It's 20, please. Here's 25. Thanks. What a cute place! - Come by soon. - Did you just open? - Yes. - All the best to you. Thank you. This is hideous. You're right. It needs some garnish. Put this on top. Does this look presentable? No. Let me fix it. Excuse me. These won't work. -Take them off -Who is she? - The deliveryman. - Give me some fruit. I need a napkin for my hands, please. There! it's beautiful! Your French toast. Thank you. Hey, it's me, Priscilla. - Hello. - Call me Priscilla. - Barbra. - Hello, Barbra. It's like eating a custard. So tender and soft. You must have made it the classic way. And this coffee. Clear layers, luscious foam... Fragrant and smooth. Who knew coffee could be such a joy? I give you four stars. It's better than Priscilla's. What is this place called? La Je T'aime. It's mine and my girlfriend's. The name is her idea. How romantic! But you have misspelled it. In French, the "La" should go after the word "cafe." Now, it's just La Cafe. And Je T'aime is missing an apostrophe and the letter "M." Now, it's Je Taie. And taie is French for "pillowcase." And what does that make it? The Pillowcase of LA Cafe. Pillowcase, you know? Correct it. Add the apostrophe and the letter "M." The light is about to change. It's red! You keep jaywalking, you'll get killed. See? We've crossed. And we're still alive. This is critical. The coffee beans must be fresh. The coarseness of grind - must match the degree of roast. - Order, please. - Go take her order. - Don't bother me. I'm busy. I want to order food. Thanks, please come again. - What? - What? May I help you? Coming. I'm getting it. I can balance, look. - That looks like fun. - A latte, thanks. - May I see the menu? - Yes, right away. - Thanks. - Thanks. The grind is too fine. Let me try again. Let me play. One look and you know they are winners, right? Yes, they are the stars of our show, the Four Boys of Central. We never planned to hire these guys. I can brew coffee. I can make latte art. I can bake pastries. I can't do anything, but I have 60,000 online fans. That's free publicity. Great! When can you girls start? We'll call you. Water temperature is very important when making coffee. Perfection is 90 degrees on the dot. Can you three make coffee? Make latte art? Bake pastries? We can learn. But do we get paid extra? Don't call us, we'll call you. You guys can start next week. If the cafe had a prize for the Most Perfectly Matched Couple, it would go to Lorraine and Roy. - They're gorgeous, stylish and healthy. - Is this pretty? - This is not bad. - Most importantly, they're generous tippers. Who wants cake? This wonderful baker who lets everyone taste her food is Priscilla, daughter of the owner of Priscilla's Eatery down the street. Since we became good friends, in addition to supplying us with French toast, she'd often come to give us her shop's business. - It's you guys. - What a great friend. Still young. Look, a new cafe. Let's see how long it lasts. Look! See how amazing I am. I can balance myself perfectly! Can you be serious for a second? I am. I'm practicing balance. Balance? Right now, I have a psychological imbalance. How do you decide who to buy from? He's over ten percent more expensive than average. The thing with business is they profit from us and we profit from others. That's what trade is all about. Do you even understand trade? All you know are freeloaders. Freewin and Man Kit never pay for their drinks. Just 10,000 and they think they are major shareholders. What are a few drinks between friends? - It's my treat. Just put it on my account. - Your treat? Do you know what that means? Do you know your cafe is losing money? It's our cafe. It's yours too. I know that. So, I do the records, brew coffee, make sandwiches, purchase supplies and clean. And you? What do you do? I do the management. What? I said I do the management! Why are you shouting at me? You can read, right? If so, you would have corrected our sign by now. Do you know how to spell "shame"? Shall I tell you? It starts with the letter "S." - Where are you going? - Letter "S." To change the sign. Don't come back until it's done. If I come back, I'm an asshole. Hey. Open up, Barbra! I'm freezing. There's no one here by that name. Pretty lady, open the door. And who might you be? I'm A-Hole. What does that mean? Asshole. Come in. - Start work... - Start work... Let's go! Who should we fire first? Four-eyes. Delivery! Boobie. There's no one here by that name. Barbie then. Cheer up. I come bearing gifts! Where do you want this? Put it against the wall. The Fab Four? Four Boys, help move the tables and chairs. Move those tables. Put this against the wall. All right. What are you trying to do? This wall is too colorful. That's bad Feng Shui. It will cause conflict between you two. This shelving unit will help your relationship. So I brought it over just for you. It's hideous. It's too white. This is a Feng Shui issue. - Thank you. - You're welcome. My mom always taught me to be generous yet thrifty. Even if that bitch divorces me for another man, I will sincerely give them my blessing. After all, even if I don't want something, I should donate it to the less fortunate, right? We're done, sir. Thank you very much. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing? - Thank you, sir. - Thanks for your hard work. Thank you. What's this? The bitch didn't take it with her. I don't want to see it at home, so I brought it over. This is a great spot. You four, move these away. Hurry, bring it here. Freeze. Is this your storage room? You can't put your stuff here. I have a share in this cafe. Just 10,000 makes you a major shareholder? I'm going to the restroom. When I come back, this man, this shelf and this chair had better be gone. She doesn't want to see you. You went too far. Pull it to the left a bit more. Push it back to the right. What are you guys doing? Where's Sam? He went out. Sam Wong! Here! Bird's nest in almond syrup. My boyfriend's favorite. No, thanks. How did you get here? I came in from the back door. It's okay. Don't let it go to waste. Four Boys! Coming! Take this. Share among you guys. Careful, it's hot. What has he done this time? He's never done anything right. He's like a child and I have to clean up after him. Look at you. You're always annoyed. If I were him, I couldn't stand you either. Be honest. Aren't you afraid Boobie will be upset you snuck out? The problem is not the sneaking out. It's that I'm with you two. He is sand, which is trash. I'm cement, also trash. But together, we become concrete, which is precious. That's right. I take you for a bottle of '87 Chateau Laffite. A gem. I also take Boobie for cat-poop coffee. She is also precious. But putting you two together, you become trash. - If you dare, tell that to her face. - Sure. - You think I wouldn't dare? - Tell her if you have balls. - Tell her later. - I will. If he was more mature, I wouldn't be so upset. You know, women shouldn't get upset It's so bad for the skin. Your skin is a bit dry, but it's not from being upset. Then what is it from? You guys haven't done "it" in a while, right? Wow, you're direct. Let me rephrase then. Every relationship requires both parties to work hard to maintain it. Right? Yes. See? It's clear you haven't maintained it in a while. Your skin is so dry it's turning crispy. You're over-exaggerating. It's not that I haven't worked hard to run it. I work hard to run the cafe. But, Sam only thinks about how to run me. I don't want that, so I shut down. That would be awful. Slow down! Your testosterone must be overflowing. You're ruining the bike. Wait for me! No. His requests are very strange. Tell me. He always wants to do it in other places. So? That's it? Don't you find it strange? I wouldn't want to do it just in bed. Where else would you? Guess. The kitchen? The world is so big. It doesn't have to be at home. Public toilet? Too stinky. The park. Too many mosquitoes. It'd be too itchy. Where then? I'll give you a hint. It's still my own place. Don't tell me it's Priscilla's? Yes, we did. Where in Priscilla's? That's not important. We cleaned it up really well. That's gross. It is a little. But I must say it's so good for my skin. Try it sometime. No, thanks. Who's calling? Is it Boobie? Who else? You're brave to hang up on her. She will tell me off when I get back anyway. So, I'll just combine it into one session. A relationship needs constant work. It's a picture. What is it? It's out of focus. You're a clueless, lucky bastard! It's Boobie's cleavage. - So clueless. - Stop, wait. - I'll save it. - Let me see. How can you tell? Not like this! It's Barbra without a bra, just Bar. You're right. You're right. - See? - It's much deeper now. Will you come home tonight and get it on with me? I'll reply for you. - Why? - I'll teach you. Tell her, "I'm ready for the long haul." - The long haul. Can you do it? - I... - No, I don't. Let me do it. - No? - Hurry. - You're in my way. Damn, you did it too hard. I worry you'll go soft tonight. Here's soft for you. - Hard for you. - Clearly. Hey! Phone, wallet, keys. - All here. - Let's go. Go where? Are you okay? I'm fine. Are you sure? Wait. FROM BARBRA, WE JUST GOT IT ON AT THE CAFE WE DID IT THREE TIMES! THANKS FOR THE HELP FROM LOK, SORRY, NOT TONIGHT, RAIN CHECK What's wrong with the floor? Why? - I keep tripping. - Gosh. You polished the whole floor last night. It's fine. Didn't I tell you to dump that shelf? Stop fixing it. Didn't Priscilla tell you to clean everything up? Cheer up. We rarely go on dates. If not today, we'll go tomorrow. No big deal. Here. Forget it! We rarely go out. Do you have to act this way? Was it always because of me? You weren't at fault? Stop right there. I hate men like you. Let's break up. Are you crazy? You're so spoiled. I really can't take it anymore, you know? You bought these for me. I'm giving them back. Really? - Then, I'm giving these back too! - Hey. You bought them last time in Italy. Here you go. These shoes were your birthday gift. I'll even give back these pants. - Wait, sir. - You're nuts. Don't do that. You shouldn't... Sorry. Hey, you! Stop! Hey, they left something. - What? - Hey. - What is it? - Don't do that. - Rings. - Yes. - It fits me. - Take it off. They will come back for these. What's that? A picture of them. This was taken at the Ladies Market. - How could you tell? - It's obvious. Don't touch their stuff. We will return it when they come back. Hey, let's grab a muffin at Sam's cafe. A muffin? No, let's just have tea. I need to lose weight. Why do you suddenly need to lose weight? I need to stay fit. I'm marrying Daisy at the end of the year. You're getting married? Really? - Yes. - When did you decide on this? I proposed last time we were in London. In London? That was a month ago. Why didn't you tell me? I'm telling you now. It has taken you this long to tell your best friend? Are you upset? Upset? No. Why would I be? I'm starving. I'm going to grab a bite at Sam's cafe. Hey. Hey. Come here. What did I mess up now? Nothing. Put that down first. A couple came by today. The man was screaming at the woman... Never mind. Come over here. Move aside. Move aside. Act like the guy earlier. Such a gossip hound. The man screamed at the woman. "What do you mean?" They hadn't ordered yet, and they said something about rarely going out. No, they had already finished their coffee by then. Whatever. Something about rarely going out. Move aside. Get up. There was a bag here. She took it. The guy said, "You're nuts." Then she left. We're not there yet. He first said something like, "Can't take it?" but in another language. And they came over here. Who cares about what they said? Then he said, "Here you go." No, what did she say before that? - "I'm giving them back." - "I'm giving them back." Then they guy started taking off his clothes. - Do it. - What? Who took off their clothes? You should have come earlier. Let's start over. - Again? - Rewind. Quickly. "We rarely go out. Do you have to act this way?" - Something like, "Don't go!" - Something like what? - He said, "Stop right there." - Right, stop, and then... "I'm giving them back," like that. "I'm giving these back too." Then the guy started taking his clothes off. He first took off his jacket. "You're nuts!" "You bought these for me. I'm giving them back." - Then, he... - She loves this next part. Who took off their clothes and pants? You did, didn't you? Boobie, you undressed? That was it? - What? - I'm done. You finish the story. - Why did she take off her clothes? - Hey. - Did she really undress? Wait. - Wow. A couple were sitting there, I think they are from Hunan. No, they're not from Hunan. A Mandarin-speaking couple was sitting there. They started to argue. - He... - No, they were very sweet. Why don't you tell the story yourself? You know it better. No. - You should tell it. - No, you do it. - You started. - Please go ahead. So, I can tell it now. They sat there and didn't even drink their coffees. I didn't understand what they were fighting about. Then they went over there and left. I don't care who said what. I only care about the woman who took off her clothes. How was her figure? Was it this woman? - She looks plain. - That's right. No. The woman didn't take off her clothes. I'll say this one last time. A couple fought, then broke up. He took off his clothes. She left. He chased her. The end. What's the point? - What's the point? - What's the point? Here's the point. Don't ask. Come and see for yourself. "I'm a pair of rings." Not bad. "A symbol of expectations people have about love. By buying me, a couple thinks they can own a lifetime of love. But love doesn't work like that. You have to always get along and keep it up every day." - That's right. - What? That's love. - Yes. - You're amazing! Thank you. - He is right. - You have good taste. He hit the nail on the head. - Thanks. - He copied it. What? I composed it. - You copied it? - It came to me on the spot. You copied. - Do I look like I'm lying? - Where did you copy it from? Why would I copy? The line about... a lifetime of love came from my heart. A true friend of the Scholar of North Point Public School and his sidekick. We're so proud. Thank you. - Hey... - What? What is it? It's like this. What is it? - We all know... - What are you looking at? you still kept every tissue used by your first love. - Quit joking. - He's so embarrassed. Write something for him. Then you may reclaim the title of Scholar of North Point Public School. Come on, write something. I said no. You just don't know what to copy. - Write. - I'll show you right now. - Watch. - Go on. I got it. Youthful loves are all perfect regrets. Buddy. Go on. Leave them here. I have something too. Hi, Honey. What happened to your hair? I shaved it off because you said you've never seen me bald. Do you like it? What do you want? Let's start over. You know I have a boyfriend now. If you want me to be happy, give us your blessing. I give you my blessing. Honey. This was your first gift to me. I cannot bear to part with this cigarette case. Even now, I carry it on me. Throw it away. I know my wife still loves me. As soon as she saw me, she noticed my new hairstyle. Enough! I've heard enough. I think you should give up, okay? When I took out the cigarette case, her eyes turned red. She told you to throw it away. Let me help you. My cigarette case. Don't throw it! Over here. - Don't throw it! Give it back to me! - Catch. Here you go, damn hag! Why did you throw my cigarette case away? Give it back to me. My case... He really dived in! - Where is my cigarette case? - How long have you known me? My case! Let's go all the way! Here. Damn. - Damn. - Let's go. See you later. You bastards! Damn. Some pain cannot be verbalized. Some love cannot be understood. SOME PAIN CANNOT BE VERBALIZED SOME LOVE CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD Excuse me, I want to put the stuff my ex and I had here. How much does it cost? How much? We weren't together long. But I drew everything about him. Now I don't want it anymore. May I put it here? How much does it cost? I'll pay anything! Please write a touching story for me.

Deal, 600 dollars. AS TIME GOES BY, WE SHALL FIND A BRAND-NEW HEART AND FORGET THE HEARTBEAT THAT WAS NEVER OURS When he said he'd leave me, I attempted suicide with this. I held this knife, planning to stab myself like this. I thought he would stop me as he usually did. But he didn't and called my bluff. I couldn't let him win, so I stabbed myself. I just managed to cut my skin. Please put it in the second space on the third row. That was his seat in school. Thank you so much! Because... Not there, down below! IN THE FACE OF DEATH, WE KNOW THE VALUE OF LIFE IN THE FACE OF LOSS, WE KNOW THE VALUE OF HAVING SOMETHING You broke up with the fat girl? No. You're the third wheel? This is a picture of me. No way. This is you? I used to look like that. Back then, in order to keep him, I borrowed money for plastic surgery in Korea and dieted. In the end, he left me anyway. I don't blame him. I was a fool. But, I really miss the old me. Love is great. A man like that is not worth it. But which plastic surgeon did you go to in Korea? What do you want to fix? Her buttocks. My girlfriend and I loved Eason. Now she doesn't like him anymore. She likes someone named G-Dragon. Those fire-spitting dinosaurs. Can you make me a cup of coffee? Because my throat is a bit dry from talking. Your coffee. This is the most bitter thing I've tasted! Is it really coffee? This bitterness, matches my present mood so well! May I have a cookie? Please take care of Cloudy. Feed him five times a day. A goldfish! Do we accept it? Sure, take everything. How about a dog? Sir, your Breakup Coffee. It's so bitter! He gave me this bow. I've just played... my last song with it. I don't need it anymore. He's about to get married. I hate him. My ex-girlfriend gave me this cell phone. Next time, you might try our Breakup Coffee. It's still here. It's crowded. I hear there's a breakup mini storage. More like a columbarium. I loved him. But I arrested him with my own hands. Look at this... How cute! You can display all these? Here's to Roy's wedding Cheers! - Cheers! - Thanks, guys. I thought you two were dating. - With him? - With her? I wouldn't choose him. We're just good friends. More than that, we're like brothers. - Cheers! - Cheers! Hey! Try my sticky rice with preserved meat. My boyfriend ate so much of this. - Bring some plates. - There are scallions. Not a problem. I like scallions. They taste good. - I'll serve. Come, eat up. - Nice. Looks delicious. Put this here. Is she taller than Lorraine? I'd rather not say. Here's one for each of you. Eat up! Do you like it? Yes? Then eat more. Which of you is Ms. Priscilla Yu? I am. You are a suspect in a vandalism case. Please come to the precinct to assist in our investigation. This must be a mistake. My friend won't do that. There is no mistake. Ms. Priscilla Yu. We suspect you used sticky rice with preserved meat to intentionally damage Mr. Chin Ka Lok's car. Please come with us to assist in our investigation. ASIA CAR RACER PLEASE DRIVE CAREFULLY Why don't we take you home? We can't be seen together. At the movies, we have to sit separately. So, I long to travel where people don't know him. Then we can date openly. But even then, we can't take pictures together. One time, we went to Tokyo with some friends. We visited the Tokyo Tower. One of them took a picture of the two of us. Everyone else was in shock. He deleted it in front of me. That had been our only picture together. He carried on as if nothing happened. I was heartbroken. He could have treated it as a picture with a fan. - Yes. What a jerk. - Every remnant of a breakup represents the most unforgettable moment of a relationship. It could be a vow of everlasting love or a last-ditch effort to save the relationship. Our Breakup Mini Storage lets everyone who's been in love show the most touching, heart-breaking moments of their love stories. EVERYONE CAN BE DEFINED BY A POEM, BUT IN YOURS, I AM ONLY A TYPO What are you doing here? Why don't you go in? We would like to go inside but no one's there. That's right. Hello. Where are you? What? Are you crazy? What a great retail space! Yes. Both floors are spacious and don't need renovation. Yes, and the landlord is a nice guy. He's very supportive of the dreams of young - entrepreneurs like you. - Really? You're mistaken. We've created our business. Now we're expanding by opening a branch. - Congratulations. - Opening what branch? - It's Boo... - It's Boobie. Hello, Boob-Boobie. I'm Paul. Thanks. Come here. Why do you suddenly want a branch? It's not sudden. We've discussed it in a group chat for a while now. The agent had time, so, we came to look around. At least you're just looking. We're more than just looking. We're quite sure. Our Breakup Mini Storage and Breakup Coffee are popular. So we want to open a branch. We've discussed this. We've decided to register the trademark in English or French. Then issue member pre-paid cards so they can easily buy coffee and rent space. Really. It sounds real. Yes. But, count me out. I'm going to open the cafe. How can we count you out? If we open a branch, you're still the boss. Sam Wong, why do you always get carried away? You guys talk and if it sounds fun, you want in. Grow up. This isn't for fun. It was my suggestion. That's even worse. You never discussed it with me. I'm discussing with you now. I say no. End of discussion. Don't say no just yet. Hear me out. Freewin and I planned this out in great detail. Him? Is he that intelligent? But Boobie, we really have a great idea. It will work for sure. Let me hear it. Actually, we still need to refine some details. Freewin, Man Kit, I've known you so long so I know you guys well. You may talk too much and be slightly misogynistic but you are loyal friends. But because of that, whenever Sam gets an idea, you support him without thinking. Isn't that the same as hurting him? To be honest, I had my doubts in the beginning. Barbra is right. We must look at it from all angles. Sam, you're also to blame. You should have discussed this major decision with her. Are you done? Sam, I got your back. I hope you still remember. Before your divorce, you told us you were sure you saw her cheating on you. We supported you and went to catch them in the act. But ended up crashing her belly dance group lesson. So your support of Sam here is questionable to me. I hope you understand. Of course. We completely understand. It's just a misunderstanding. Just say you're sorry. Why? I didn't do anything wrong. He's in the wrong. But you can still choose. Yet a great space like this doesn't come often. Let me show you the upstairs. I'm sure you'll be happier then. Sam. I heard from the Four Boys that you often broke up. They said you broke up with her at least 99 times. Is that true? I've never asked for a breakup. She was always the one who did. Do you follow the Premier League? One team, Arsenal, went undefeated for 49 matches. But Barbra is undefeated, period. Every time she mentions breaking up, I surrender. Have you tried to reason it out with her peacefully to resolve your problems? That is when she's the most unreasonable. Whenever I try to reason with her she'll suddenly say, "Why are you pointing at my face? It's disrespectful." Then I'll give in and she'll say, "What's with your tone? Do you respect me? You don't love me at all." I have no answer to that. So, she always ends up as the winner and I become the loser. Do you think the Breakup Mini Storage works? It's great! You can open several branches. I agree. I plan to apply for a patent. I support you. Thank you. Next Saturday then. Stay in touch. Where did you want to open your branch? Show me. Now? Are you tired? Do you need to rest? No. It's near, just around the corner. Turn there? Yes, that's right. Sorry, Mr. Wong. Paul is showing another property to a client. - May I show you around? - Sure. I've seen it already. See, the layout is good. and there's a loft upstairs. Excuse me, I have to take this. Make yourselves at home. No problem. Come, look at this. I plan to set up the Breakup Mini Storage here. - This whole wall. - Right here? From here all the way to the display window. Anyone walking by can see it. Looks good, right? Not bad. Now come here. The sofa goes here. When business is slow, I can look outside, like this. Put a table here. Not the sofa but a table, right? Yes. Should we use redwood or oak for the table? The service area starts here. Here is the bar. The Italian cups and dishes go here. The coffee machines go here. And I will brew coffee here. Here's your coffee. - Thank you. - Good. There will be an island here. I will put my coffee cup here and talk like this. It smells great. Hey! Look out! I want to order. - Ying, give this to the customer. - Watch where you're going! Sorry. Ma'am, I messed up. She wanted a latte, not a regular coffee. Bring these to table three. - The customer is waiting for the order. - What a waste! Can't you see we're busy? Yes, I'm helping out. - Really? - Yes. And yet you're still playing around. What are your orders? What do you want me to do? Nothing. Just play around. And you say you want to open a branch? Fine, then we won't. Just stop talking about it. Am I wrong? Look at your attitude. Why are you pissed off? Let's clarify that today. I'm not. - You're not mad? - Right. - There's nothing you want to say? - Nothing. I have something to say. Every day, you sit there like a log. What have you done besides playing around? Look at yourself. You don't think you've gone too far? I'm fine. How have I gone too far? I did a lot of work. Can't you see? Come over here. The soul of the cafe, the Mini Storage, is my design. The idea of Breakup Coffee is also mine. Please look carefully. I did all of these. Yes, only you can come up with these ideas. - But they are all gimmicks. - Of course. How long can they last? Six months, tops. - Stop doing these silly things. - Wait. Aren't they successful? Don't disregard my creativity. They are my ideas. Have you ever succeeded? Aren't we successful now? Can't you see? Can you please not act like this? Act like what? Act like a child. This happens every time. Ask yourself how old you are. You're in your 40s. All you think about is goofing around. You make things sound grand. You say you opened the cafe for our future. But actually, you only want to play around. But you supported me. - That's the only reason I did this. - Yes. - I supported you. Do you know why? - Now I want to... I supported you because I could see our future here. But the longer this cafe is open, the less I see it. I can't see it anymore. You can't see it because you don't understand me. You reject everything I suggest. Can you try supporting me? The problem lies with you. Can you stop treating me like a kid? You think I want to treat you like a kid? You think I want to babysit a child? - To babysit you? - Right now, you... I am your girlfriend, not your maid. - You are my boyfriend. - You're more like my mom. Do you think I want to be your mom? I don't know. You just don't understand me. You know what, everyone else knows that I'm mature and creative. Put yourself in my shoes for once, okay? Everybody else thinks you've matured. So, I'm the one who has a problem? Let's break up then. There you go again. Who said that once the cafe is open, we won't say that again? Who said it? You're right. That's why I'm serious this time. You refuse to grow up, Sam Wong. I don't want to babysit you anymore. I'm sick of it. I'm done taking care of you. Let's break up. You two can't be serious. I don't believe it. You're kidding, right? Sam, go get her back. She must be heartbroken. We don't know where Barbra went. The business is failing. Boss is very depressed. I know, why don't you sing the blues? Welcome. Feel free to look around. Yes, this is the cafe. - Excuse me. - There are so many things here. - That's ours. - Our rings. Nuts! You still remember us? Of course. Didn't you two break up? Last time, I... After we argued here, we did break up for a while. A friend later sent us an article on your cafe. We saw our rings in the picture. You wrote about them in such a touching way. I decided to win her back. And we're together again. What did I write? This. This is it. I'M A PAIR OF RINGS, A SYMBOL OF EXPECTATIONS PEOPLE HAVE ON LOVE. BY BUYING ME, A COUPLE THINKS THEY CAN OWN A LIFETIME OF LOVE, BUT LOVE DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS GET ALONG AND KEEP IT UP EVERY DAY. You refused to go on a diet. It may not fit you now. Let's put them on. Boss, what are you doing up there? Correcting our sign. Why are you suddenly doing that? I should have corrected it a long time ago. That's not the best way to change it. If you change even that, nothing will be the same anymore. Enjoy the spa. Try to relax. Stop checking your phone. You're mistaken. The Four Boys and Freewin are texting me. All the more reason to ignore them. Please, just correct what's wrong and move on. IS BARBRA STILL ANGRY? WHERE ARE YOU? Normally, he would have apologized during our massage. It's taking him quite some time. Never mind. If he doesn't apologize, we'll stay a few more days. I'm not in any hurry. What if he doesn't apologize? That won't happen. He's good at that. He always apologizes. Once we were in a worse fight than this. I was so mad I flew to Australia on my own. He followed me to Australia but didn't know where I went. He waited at the airport for a week. Isn't that silly? Then he's really good to you. He really is. Look at that smile! I don't get it. Why fight? Why does it matter who apologizes first? Give in once and you lose forever. Plus, I'm right. Yes, you're completely right. Of course. Let's order rice noodles with beef. - Okay? - Too greasy. That looks good. I should try that. I have to go. - What's wrong? - I have to go. Come here. Hello, Chin Ka Lok. Hello, Angela. She's a fan. Will you take a picture with her? It's her birthday. I don't like pictures. Sure, go ahead. Here, I'll take it. Stand closer. Put your hand here. It's her birthday. Look at me. One. Two. Three. Thank you. She's so nervous. Yes. She looks familiar. Do you know her? I'm glad you don't. Where are you going? Why did you have to do that? I had forgotten it. Why make me remember? Now it all came back. If you really forgot and moved on, you wouldn't have reacted that way. Please. You're better off without a guy like that. You're crying your eyes out but where is he? What has he given you besides pain? We had happy times. I knew it would end this way. I just wanted to delay it. Come on. What are you doing? You've grown up. It's time to delete your past with him. Good. Please keep this picture for me for a while. Thanks. Come on. Taste my new concoction. It's full of intelligent truth about love. It's good stuff. Here. Taste it. Is it sweet yet bitter? Is it cold yet hot? Then you get it. Tell me what it means. Love is like an affogato. It's sweet, bitter, hot and cold. You totally missed the point. It's telling you to switch to tea and everything will be okay. Come here. Since the bitch took over, how has he changed? It's not all bad, actually. He quit drinking, smoking and cursing. Not just him. I've cut down on cursing too. Meaning you're worse than before. You've both changed. What have you become? Aren't you scared when you get up every morning? The guy in the mirror is not even you. I know what you mean. Being with Barbra puts a lot of pressure on me. As your friends, we're under even more pressure. Since Boobie appeared, you keep getting dumped. Then we need to console and support you. Sure, we support you. But why? We hope you can be a man. And stand up for yourself. But once we turn around you grovel back to her. I'm sorry, guys. I know what you think of Barbra. She's tough and rough all the time. I get very frustrated every time we break up. I've thought about getting another girl. I know I can. But, I'd remember things from the past. Together we've gone through so much. Like, you know, I don't get along with my dad. She'd have dim sum with my parents every week. Even though we're still not close, at least I'm willing to see them for a meal and a chat. And our flat. You say she's forcing me to marry her. But the flat was a good buy. My future lies here. Our cafe idea. She was the first to disagree with it. But she has worked the hardest on it. Sometimes I wonder if I am immature. No. You've changed a lot. The bitch is the problem. Give her an inch, and she'll take a mile. Right? There will not be a 101st breakup. So I've decided to let her win it all. I will marry her. I praised you just now because your life is a tragedy and I didn't want you to be depressed. You haven't become that mature, right? You're not ready, wake up. Don't do such stupid things. We've been talking all night but you don't care how we feel. You've made up your mind. Don't bother looking for me. Where are you going? We're like brothers, man! What more is there to say? As buddies, we have to back each other up. We just want him to be happy. Try to understand. Freewin and I want the best for you. But you've chosen a tough road. Think it through properly. Where is she? Taking a shower inside. Thanks. - Sorry. - I'm going to scream. Sorry, don't be mad. I won't open a branch. I'm not mad about that. I'm mad because you don't know why you're wrong. Your attention span is only three minutes. So I've decided. - I... - You always interrupt. Can you let me finish? It's like I never let you do anything. I'm the only one managing the cafe now. Can you take some responsibility? What did you just decide? So I've decided... I've decided to change all my bad habits. But promise me never to say "break up" again, okay? I'm serious. All right, I won't say "break up," okay? Go out. Let me finish my shower. Who told you I was here? Must be Priscilla. She's always playing with her phone. This is a nice place. The room is big. Plus there's a pool outside. If you're not opening a branch let's invest here. What's wrong with you four? I turn my back and you mess up. Are you two are okay now? You're nuts. What could have happened? Hi, Melody. Did you beg her to come back, boss? Shame on you. Looking straight ahead. You are truly a man among men. Awesome. Here. Stop talking and hand them over. That will be 100 dollars each. I told you so. Back to work. Back to work. "Breaking up broke your heart. But the world did not end. Instead of dying, you grew stronger." It's been a long time. It really has. This is good. Did you write it? No, my boyfriend did. Really? Sam. It's been a while. This is nicely written. I copied it. Then you copied well. And your penmanship is good. French toast and coffee? Latte. Go make him a latte. He makes really good coffee now. - Really? - Yes. Let me take you to your table. - Your latte. - Thank you. You're welcome. So, I want to make a suggestion. I hope you don't mind. I suggested you correct the spelling on your sign. I see that you did, though it's done quite haphazardly. But now that I look at it, I think the old way looked better. Don't you agree? But, we've changed it. Some things you can't change back. Come on. You just pinned it on. Can you please make me one of those coffees? What coffee? The really bitter one from last time. The one that was crazy bitter. You mean our Breakup Coffee? - Yes. - We don't make it anymore. How can that be? Of course, you can make it. Please make it for me one last time. I'll even pay for the cookie. Please. Don't. I'll make you a latte. Latte? I didn't come here to drink a latte. I can make that at home. Take some powder, add some water and that's it. I drink it, I'm happy. I don't need to come here. I came here to drink that very bitter coffee that matches my mood right now. Do you understand? I want the really bitter one. Why haven't you grown up? Come to your senses. Forget about the Breakup Coffee. It's no more. I'll make you a latte, okay? Sorry, what does "come to your senses" mean? I'll make you a latte. What's wrong, Officer? I feel something has changed. How so? Come here, all of you. Whose idea was it to change the sign like that? It was the boss' idea. Do you think it looks good? No. Why didn't you tell him? I told... But he's the boss. Of course, we respect his decision. - So what if he's the boss? - And... Tell him if something is wrong. You don't dare to do it? I... What? Another meeting? No, it's nothing. Barbra says, the sign... Looks good! You finally noticed. Yes, it's quite cute. As long as you like it. Well, get back to work. Back to work. Back to work. Let me help you. Thanks. She hated it a minute ago. The boss came back and now it's fine. What's going on? She complained we didn't have the guts, but she didn't dare tell him too. Of course, she wouldn't dare. They just made up. Maybe she's worried he'll run off. Don't talk behind people's backs. Let's go out for dinner after work tonight. I have to go to class. What class? A coffee-making course. It's three times a week. I've never heard you mention it. It was supposed to be a surprise. I'm leaving. Turn off the lights later and lock up. ARE YOU STILL IN CLASS? YES, DON'T WAIT UP. GO TO SLEEP. Thanks, the total is 60 dollars. Here's your change. - Take a seat inside. - Thank you! This is Priscilla's. Yes. What would you like to order? Yes. Anything else? Okay. It will be ready in 15 minutes. Are you awake? Then, let's talk. You've been grinding your teeth in your sleep lately. Are you under a lot of pressure? Is it because of the cafe? The Four Boys? Or me? It's the class. Something just doesn't feel right. I thought so. I can see you're anxious and tired at the cafe. Don't stress yourself out. I got you some stuff. Take the bee pollen twice a day. It helps you sleep. Luohan Fruit capsules once a day. Take them now. - I'll take them tomorrow. - Take them now. No, tomorrow. I'll get you some water. I said tomorrow! - Boobie. - Is Sam seeing someone else? All our friends know Sam Wong has died a martyr's death. Why? Because you have sucked him dry. He listens to your beck and call, but to what end? Now you're accusing him of being unfaithful. What's wrong with you? But he's become a different person altogether. What did you tell him when I was gone? It doesn't matter what we told him. He never listens anyway. He only cares about you. I think you should reflect on what you've said or done to him. Boobie. It's time you looked at it from his point of view. Boobie, nice of you to visit us. Congratulations. We have a meeting to talk about something. We'll see you another time. What happened? Haven't Sam proposed already? - Just shut up. - How would I know. Why did she come? "Congratulations"? Come on. It didn't happen? You think you're a billionaire or what? Always buying useless stuff. Happy birthday from a billionaire. Hey! That hurts! - What's wrong? - Your fingernails are digging into me. Then trim them for me. No, trim them yourself. TAKE YOUR TIME, I'M GOING TO WORK Do you think I'm a good girlfriend? You're okay. Then why couldn't I notice his misery? And I don't understand why he's miserable. I want to make him happy but I don't know how. I'm so scared. He might realize he doesn't love me all that much. What then? Maybe the way you love him is not what he wants? So what does he want? Only you would know that. He wants to win, just once. I don't think it has to do with winning or losing. You're right. It doesn't. I get it. Let's go. Where are we going? I want to show you something. Come on. Congratulations, sir. Invite me to your opening party. Sure. Sorry, Ms. Kong. You came too late. This gentleman just signed the agreement. How can that be? I wanted it first. I know and I'm so sorry. But he loved it at first sight and paid the deposit. I tried my best to talk to the landlord, but it didn't work. This is ridiculous! What do we do now? I remember. I have a few other spaces just like this one. You won't feel the difference. The nearest one is a block away. I'll bring you there now. You'll love it. Let's go. What do you mean? You didn't tell me you rented it out. Am I invisible to you? Do we not tell each other anything anymore? Sam Wong. Stay! Come clean with all your grievances. You're upset I vetoed the branch so I brought you here. It wasn't just my fault, - it was yours, too. - Just stop, okay? Sam Wong, are you trying to break... SHOP FOR RENT LORRAINE Hello? Sure. Hey. Are you... - Take me home. - What? Star Street, please. It's Roy's wedding. Why did you leave so soon? Get some rest. I'll see you. Can you stay with me for a while? I don't think that's a good idea. I ALREADY HAVE YOU I DON'T NEED ANYTHING MORE I always thought the worst thing that could happen is you leaving me. But it broke my heart to realize I don't know how to love anymore. Good morning. Good morning. Let's go to work when you're done. Relationships are not predestined. They cannot be guaranteed. So if you meet someone who's willing to grasp your hand tightly, please don't let it go so easily. IT'S OVER IT'S NEVER OVER
