(MultiCom Jingle) (exciting music) (booming) (clock ticks) - My name is Josh Kirby. I was just your average ninth grader. My biggest problem was getting good grades, and my idea of excitement was racing my bicycle. (bell rings) Yes! I never thought time would catch up with me, but I couldn't have imagined that hundreds of years from now mankind would invent the Nullifier, a device capable of controlling or destroying the universe. - [Irwin] Prepare for the storm. - [Josh's Voiceover] A scientist named Irwin 1138 tried to disassemble and hide the Nullifier, but even he couldn't stop. - [Irwin] Dr. Zoetrope! (zinging) (exciting instrumental music) - Give me the Nullifier. - You're too late, Zoetrope. - It's never too late for me. (zooming) - Irwin and Zoetrope have been chasing each other across the time stream, trying to be the first to find the Nullifier's pieces. This time they're gonna land in 1995. The place, my front yard. Now I'm going along for the ride of all time. (zooming) What's goin' on, where are we? - I hope you're prepared to do battle, young man. This will be a war through time, and Dr. Zoetrope will take no prisoners. (booming) (exciting instrumental music) - [Josh] But we've got help from a warrior. - My name is Azabeth Siege. - Oh, she's amazing! And a magical creature called Prism to show us the way. Together, we're on a quest through time, visiting different worlds to fight for the Nullifier's pieces. - I'm obviously in the right place and the right time. - Because if Zoetrope ever assembles the Nullifier, he'll conquer time itself. I've gotta try and save the universe. (exciting instrumental music) (swords clang) (exciting instrumental music) I was just a 14-year-old kid before my adventure began, but now I'm Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. (upbeat exciting music) - [Narrator] On the last chapter of Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. (zooming) - 70,379 AD. (yells) - Yeah, what was that thing? I thought we were still on Earth. - We are still on Earth, Josh, but the Earth of the far future. (yelling) (exciting instrumental music) - Come on, you big bully, catch me if you can! - Listen to me, boy, there are forces at work here which you cannot understand. - Well, come along you two. Time is one thing we can't afford to waste. (zinging) - Prism, don't touch that button! I don't believe it! Prism's gone rogue! (tense instrumental music) - Help! Help! - Josh Kirby! Hold on, Josh Kirby! (Josh yells) (booming) (yelling) (slow tense music) (yelling) (swooshing) (laughing) (yelling) (groaning) - Ow, serious near head injury. It's definitely better than hyper-time with a toy box soundtrack. (sighs) Ow. (tense tinkling music) - [Man] Growl! (tense tinkling music) - Yeah, probably just the wind. (tinkling) Yeah, yeah, or else I'm hearing things. Hey, wouldn't be surprised with the number of head shots I've taken today. (slow tinkling music) ♫ Dancing in the forest ♫ Under the blue sky ♫ Sing with the birds ♫ And floating like a butterfly ♫ Living in a dreamworld ♫ Red and blue dreamworld ♫ Oh it's good to be a toy ♫ In Toy World ♫ Toy World, Toy World ♫ Oh happiness and joy world ♫ Oh it's good to be a toy ♫ In Toy World - Uh, hello? - [Doll] Hello. - Who's there? - [Doll] Who's there? - No, wait, I just saw you. - [Doll] I just saw you. - [Josh] Now this place is really weird. - [Doll] Maybe you're weird. - Excuse me? - [Doll] Excuse me? - Now, look, my name's Josh, and I'm afraid I'm lost. - Don't be afraid, Josh. - Hi. Well, I, I-I didn't really mean that I was afraid. You know, not of you anyway. - Well, maybe you should be. (laughing) (playful music) - What the heck did you do that for? - Because it's funny, why else? - Well, I don't know, maybe you're nuts! - Oh, sticks and stones, moans and groans. Call me Annie and hold still. Can't be too careful these days. Cooties, ya know. I mean, I've had my shots, but what about you? I don't know your assembly date, your batch number, your power supply. These are important considerations for a modern-day doll. - My batch number? - Oh, please, you think you can just waltz in here like some kind of studly action figure, chase me around my own house, and then pull the blank-face routine? Come on, Josh. I mean, sure, you're cute, darn cute, but you're only, (twinkling music) (gasps) oh, you're a non. - A non? - Non-toy. - And what's that make you? - [Annie] Unzip me. - What? - Just do it and you'll see. - All right, if you insist. - Lower. (zipping) (exciting music) (beeping) - Holy smokes, you mean you're a? - That's right. - You're a living doll! - Oh, why thank you, Josh. (giggles) - [Josh] Oh, uh, Annie, listen, I'm kind of confused right now, so if you could clue me in-- - Just think, a non-toy here with me. Oh, I'm so excited I could rip a stitch! - How about we start with where we are? What do you call this place? - Lookout behind you. - Look outta what? - Growl! (yells) - Boys will be boys, and bears'll be bears. Josh meet Theo. - Get off me! (growls) - He likes to play. - Hi, Theo. You know, I don't really think ambushing a poor, defenseless kid exactly counts as play. - Well he's a hungry bear. Maybe he thought you'd be good to eat. - Toys don't eat. - Well, obviously you're not up on the latest toy technology. Show him, Theo. (mumbling) (playful music) - This Teddy's a treat, he can really eat. (Theo mumbles) Oh boy, this place is really weird. - No it's not, you silly, it's Toy World. (giggles) (zooming) - [Irwin] Thank goodness you're back, Prism. Come on, you can do it, little friend. - Does he have it? Has he found the position for Josh Kirby? - Not possible. The mysterious depths of Prism's tracking powers still have to be fully fathomed. - We must succeed, we must! - I understand, young lady, but you must realize the difficulty of our task. The odds of our stumbling upon poor Josh among the eons of hyper-time are precisely one in 5,487,600-- - Yes, yes, I understand. - And three. (Prism chirps) And then, of course, there's still Dr. Zoetrope 366. There is the off chance that Zoetrope's slightly superior intellect may enhance his ability to pinpoint Josh's location. - Oh, then what you are saying is hardly encouraging. - Perhaps, but we do have one advantage, the unparalleled and infallible technology of my time pod's instrumentation. All invented by myself, of course, which will undoubtedly lead us to Josh first and prove once and for all that I am more than Zoetrope's equal. (zinging) (alarm beeps) What? - Well, is this the unparalleled or infallible part? - But, (beeping) my electronic circuits. - As the fourth code of Kang states, that which is unparalleled cannot be infallible. (alarm beeps) (giggling) - [Josh] Uh, how long til my clothes are dry? - Oh, not long, should be right this afternoon. - You mean I have to stay in these clothes all day? I look like Pinocchio. (sighs) What are you doing? - Orange pekoe, quite refreshing. (Theo mumbles) - It's all this guy Zoetrope's fault. A real evil genius, you know? Determined to twist time around his little demented finger. He also destroyed my CBL bracelet, which means I should still be in limbo land, but that's another story. - Sounds serious. - Yeah, no kidding. I've gotta get back to the time pod, so my friends and I can stop him, (playful music) put everything back to normal. - One lump of sugar or two? - The entire universe is in peril, and all you can do is drink pretend tea? Hello! Have you heard a word I've said? - Every word, Josh. You're obviously a raving lunatic non-toy who should be rushed to Gepetto immediately. - Who's Gepetto? - Oh. - Why, he who builds all toys, of course! The merry maker, the top tinker, the clever creator-- - Yeah, I got it. - And he's the only non-toy in Toy World, except for you. - Yeah, maybe he can help me. - He can do anything. - All right, let's go meet this Gepetto. We haven't got much time. - But you haven't touched your tea. - I know that, Annie. I'm just waiting for it to cool. In the meantime, I have something to tell you both, something a little scary, make that very scary. You see, Dr. Zoetrope is also a toy maker, and right now he's searching for the parts to a toy bomb that could easily destroy all of Toy World and the toy universe. It's called the Nullifier. A brilliant scientist named Irwin 1138 tried to disassemble and hide all of the six Nullifier pieces. (dramatic instrumental music) - Prepare for the storm. (dramatic instrumental music) (beeps) (dramatic instrumental music) (beeps) (dramatic instrumental music) - [Josh] Irwin 1138's plan was to scatter the pieces all across time. (swooshing) (beeps) (ringing) (slow dramatic music) (beeps) (swooshing) (dramatic music) - Next. (dramatic instrumental music) (beeps) (dramatic instrumental music) Next. (swooshing) (dramatic instrumental music) (beeping) (swooshing) We need another 93 seconds. Seal the door. - [Josh] Dr. Zoetrope, an even more brilliant scientist, has been doing everything in his power to reassemble the Nullifier pieces and destroy the universe. (exciting instrumental music) (popping) (yelling) - [Irwin] Quick, load the final component! - [Man] Let's go. (dramatic instrumental music) (thuds) (yelling) Let's go! - [Irwin] Dr. Zoetrope! (zings) - [Man] Man, run! (zinging) Go! (zooming) (beeps) (zinging) (dramatic music) - [Man] Brother! (zinging) (groans) (tense music) - [Man] I can't hold him off! (dramatic instrumental music) - [Man] Come on, we gotta get outta here! This way! (dramatic instrumental music) (men yell) - Irwin, you're a lunatic. - You're too late, Zoetrope! - It's never too late for me. (zinging) (dramatic music) (groans) (footsteps thud) (dramatic music) (rapid beeping) (tense instrumental music) In the name of all of creation, twisted old man, what have you done? (swooshing) - And it's my job to keep it from being put together. Ah, so, don't you think we should be on our way? - I say, shall we dance? - Yeah! - What? When did he talk? - [Annie] Since he wanted to dance silly. (Theo mumbles) (playful music) - I can't believe this. The fate of everything that ever has been or ever will be is up for grabs and you guys are dancing! - Oh, come on, Josh, lighten up and shake a leg. (playful music) (Theo mumbles) - Just a sec. (laughing) Wait a minute! (laughing) - What is it? - It's a piece of the Nullifier. - How did you know it was there, old man? - I didn't. (laughing) Not really. It was like, it was like I was meant to find it. (laughing) (swooshing) (alarm beeps) - Well, that should do it. Try it, Prism. (alarm beeps) (Prism mumbles) Excellent! We're back in business. (rumbling) (dramatic music) - What now? - Blast! The gravitational repulsors are still on the faulty side. The debris from the time stream is going to batter us senseless if we don't get out of here soon. - No, we cannot leave here until we locate Josh Kirby. - Well then we'd better locate him quickly or it'll be too bad for all of us. (dramatic instrumental music) (booming) - So, what's it like? - What's what like? - You know, being non-toy, truly alive. - Well, that's a hard one, Annie. Wouldn't you rather know about the periodic table or the Aztecs? - Idiotic table of spaztecs? - Nevermind. Well, I, I guess life is different for different people. I mean, everybody wakes up in the morning and brushes their teeth, but then there's about a million decisions that have to be made. It gets kind of confusing, but I guess, I guess life's what you make of it, as my dad would say over and over and over. - Oh, it sounds wonderful. - It does? - Well, sure. I mean, what you're saying is that non-toys can do anything if they try hard enough. Us toys just keep doing the same things over and over because it's how we're made. It's all we know. After awhile it gets kind of. - Tiring? - Exactly. A modern-day doll needs stimulation, and I'm just not getting any. - Well, I don't know, Annie, you seem pretty full of life to me. - Hah, I'm just a toy. Could a real person do this? (ripping) (chiming music) - Uh, yeah, well, you made your point. - I mean, toys don't learn, toys don't grow. We play the same games, sing the same songs, and dance the same dances forever. - Well it's no cakewalk being human either, or non-toy, I mean. There's a lot of problems you can't even imagine. - Now you sound like Gepetto. - Look, all I'm saying is you toys get to have nonstop fun. You don't have to worry about tests or bullies or the ozone layer. - What I wouldn't give for those problems, Josh. To awaken and face the challenges of a new day, to labor for one's dreams, to achieve one's desires, to feel the warm touch of a non-toy caress, to share with that special someone a physical and emotional bond of pure passion, the power of true love. - Well, Annie, I suddenly feel very thankful for being human. - I say, Josh old chap, look over here. - Oh, can we continue this discussion later? - Sure, I guess so. - Okay. (playful music) - Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes. - Oh, look. Gepetto's castle. (magical music) - Wow, nice place. - Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet. (playful upbeat music) - So how do we get in there? - I ask the questions around here. - Whoa, an egg that talks? - Eggxactly. - Okay, what's the question? - Knock knock. - Who's there? - I don't know. - I don't know. - I don't know who? - I don't know who you are, so you can make an eggxit. - Oh, come on, Egg, do we have to beg? - Eggxcruciating, isn't it? (chuckles) This is Toy World, remember the yolk's on you. (upbeat playful music) - [Theo] Hello, chaps, hello! - Hi, I'm just visiting. Hi, I'm a toy-boy, boy-toy, well, if you wanna get technical about it, nevermind. (laughing) (excited chattering) - Hey, Theo! - Give me five, oh! - Hi! (playful music) - [Annie] Hello. - Hi, I'm from out of town. Oh, that's a nice beak you got there. - Thank you. - That's nice, that's nice, hi, nice to see ya, nice to see ya. Oh boy, hi, hello. This is great, this. (excited chattering) (gentle music) Hey! Hey there! You must be Gepetto, right? - Why, yes. And for some reason I can't imagine, you're not a toy. - Well, no, I. - Not a toy? (drumming and whistle music) I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. (drumming and whistle music) Request permission to prepare the interrogation room, sir! - Oh, Jason, we don't even have an interrogation room. - It's Jack, not Jason. What he meant was, it's not quite operational yet, but it could be! Jack, Action Jack, private first class. (patriotic drumming and whistle music) (crunching) (chuckles) (groans) Nice to meet ya. - Yeah, yeah, a real pleasure. Look, uh, I need your help. See, I don't know how I got here and, uh, I'm kinda scared. I've gotta get back to my friends in the time pod, and you seem to be the man running the show. - Did you say show? I almost forgot. (chuckles) - It's a matter of intergalactic life and death. - Did you say death? - Start the show. - Ah, no! - Almost there. Attention friends, it's showtime. (upbeat horn music) (excited chattering) (chuckles) - Sir, what I have to tell you is really important honest. See, there's this incredibly powerful Dr. Zoetrope-- - Forget it, kid, it's showtime. The old coot won't hear a word until all this shiny happy crap is over. - Uh, just a suggestion, uh, maybe you're due for an attitude tuneup. (chuckles) (yells) (chain clangs) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, relax. (upbeat playful music) ♫ We are the toys of Toy World ♫ The happiness and joy world ♫ A toy for every boy and girl ♫ In Toy World - [Theo] Here we are, I'm, I'm ready here. Here, let's go. ♫ We are the toys Where, where are you? ♫ We are the toys of Toy World ♫ The happiness and joy world ♫ The Toy World - I swear if I have to listen to this one more time, I'm gonna explode. - Really?

(rhythmic instrumental music) (Theo mumbles) - Dance is for wimps. - (sighs) What a sourpuss. (playful rhythmic music) - [Theo] Thank you, my dear. (upbeat rhythmic dance music) ♫ Yo, yo, yo, Heavy G in the house ♫ Break it down, brother man (laughs) (upbeat rhythmic dance music) - Ah, this. (rhythmic dance music) Hello? Hello? Hah, they're all dancin'. (rhythmic music) - Go on, join the fun. Go. (rhythmic music) - At last, mi amore. (rhythmic music) (zooming) (dramatic music) - Oh, no! - Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt. (dramatic instrumental music) Except maybe that toast. - Who are you? And what do you want? - And where'd you get that awesome hardware? - I'm here for one reason and one reason only. He knows who he is and I know he's here. - [Theo] Oh, dear. - No need to look so hard, Dr. Zoetrope. I'm right in front of your time-twisted nose. - Hello, Joshua. You know what I want, just cooperate and hand it over. (dramatic instrumental music) - Cooperate? But only if all the toys are willing to never again dance in the sunshine! And if you're willing to kiss goodbye this beautiful place we call Toy World. Theo, Theo, Theo, oh, thanks, Theo. - You have no idea what you are saying, young man. - Oh yes I do. Unless you toys are with me, the universe is doomed to destruction at the hands of this madman. (tense music) So what do you say? Are you ready to join with me and stop him? Uh, like I said, are you ready to stand up for yourselves and stop this maniac? (Theo mumbles) (dramatic music) Like I said, are you ready to stand up for yourselves and stop this maniac? - [Zoetrope] Oh, give it up, Josh. - It's no use, Josh. My children are the same as I when it comes to violence. We just say no. - Hey, speak for yourself, pal. - Yeah, but this is serious. - Toys don't fight. They play. - Face it, kid, you're outgunned. - The component, Josh, now. - No way. - Then you leave me no choice. - [Theo] Ooh. (zinging) (laughs) - [Zoetrope] What? (laughs) - Your weapons are useless here, my metallic friend. - What are you talking about, you old fool? - Long ago, I installed an energy field around Toy World, a field which disrupts all offensive armaments of any kind. This is a happy place, free from violence, and that's how it shall stay. - All right, new game, everyone. - [Theo] New, new game? - Keep this glass bone away from the big, scary looking guy. What do ya say? All right. - Oh, new game! (laughing) (playful music) - Come here, no, no, no, no! (laughing) - Here ya go, Mr. Maniac. - [Zoetrope] Somebody better give me that Nullifier now! You don't know who you're playing with. - Nice going, Josh, nice going! - I thought so. - I will crush this old man's head! (yelling) Give me my Nullifier now! Come here! (yelling) If I get my hands on you, you will rue the day you ever messed with me! Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am? (laughing) Joshua, you have just signed your death warrant. - Let's go, let's go! - [Zoetrope] When I get my hands on you. - Let's go. - [Zoetrope] Oh, you leave me no choice. - Come to Daddy. (dramatic instrumental music) Oh no! - The Nullifier component is indestructible, Josh. You however are not. Tell your childish friends to give me the component at once or else. (dramatic instrumental music) My stars, where's your crowd displacement lock? - You let him go this instant! (yells) (gooey splattering) - (chuckles) This is gettin' really good. - I'm soaked! (laughing) Joshua! I'm not kidding, Joshua! (laughing) (footsteps stomp) - [Josh] Hey, toss it over here, you clown! (playful music) (laughing) (slow instrumental music) When will I learn? - [Gepetto] Direct drive! - Hurry up, Gepetto, he's headed this way. (tense music) (clicking) - Joshua, I may not be able to see you, but I can still hear you, and I'm coming for you, boy. (clicking) (playful music) I can still hear you, Joshua! You cannot escape me! (clicking) (playful music) Joshua! Joshua! You cannot escape me! (playful music) (clicking) - [Theo] (laughs) Forward, forward! (laughs) Pretty good. (playful music) (swooshes) - Very well, my little mechanical friends, how would you like to play a new game? (toys cheer) It's an extremely satisfying activity I like to call mind slavery of an inferior species. (toys gasp) Your puny brains belong to me now. You will serve my every whim. - [Toys] Our puny brains belongs to us now. We will serve our every whim. (laughing and cheering) - My stars, they have no minds to control. (yelling and clapping) - Mind slavery sure is a lot of fun! (laughing and cheering) - Hey, bud, you wanna play with these toys, you talk to me. - And who are you? - Action Jack, AKA the one toy who's a little too human for his own good. - I'm listening. - Your basic toy is a simple creature, motivated by two things, the desire to have fun and the fear of punishment. - Fear, you say? - [Jack] I thought that would get your attention. - All right, folks, after a brief consultation with my associate here, I have decided there will be no more games in Toy World. (groaning) And there won't be any more singing or dancing either. (groaning) - Oh, nice touch, Doc. - These new rules will be in effect forever and a day, unless, unless all of you help me capture that evil non-toy Josh Kirby. (groaning) (gasping) - We're sorry, sir. We didn't mean to offend you, but we'll do as you command. - A wise decision. But just in case anyone changes their mind, remember this. Disassembly is a heartbeat away. (gasping) (groaning) (swooshing) (gasping) (groaning) (dramatic music) - Attention, friends, it's showtime! (zooming) (Prism chirps) - We have been searching aimlessly and we are running out of time. - Perhaps we might fare better without this continuous commentary. - I am simply trying to ignite a source of heat beneath your hindquarters. - What? - It's just an expression. - Look, I am trying every trick in the time travel book to locate Josh. It is mildly embarrassing to admit that I'm not certain we could continue to protect the Nullifier and to defeat Zoetrope without Josh's assistance. Besides which, I've actually grown quite fond of the boy. - As have I, and I let him down, I should've protected him. - Nonsense! Josh's disappearance was Zoetrope's doing. - No, no, do not try and coddle me. The ninth code of Kang is quite Specific regarding all failure. If one snoozes, one loses. (sad instrumental music) - Oh, stop this at once! - To atone for my negligence, I must perform the sacred act of repentance. - Please, child, it's not worth it. (dramatic music) (chants in Kangian) (Prism squeals) What are you doing? - The Kangian chant of the forlorn. (chants in Kangian) - Let me revise that, my child. It's really not worth it. (chants in Kangian) - [Josh] Hey, this thing actually gets pretty good mileage. - [Gepetto] She's one of a kind, GM original. Gepetto Motors, that is. (playful music) - Look, I enjoy a good getaway just as much as the next guy, but Zoetrope won't give up. He'll be right back on me and the component in no time at all. I've gotta find a way to get back to the time pod somehow. - Well, I say we take care of that big bully once and for all. - That certainly would help return life back to normal, wouldn't it? - [Theo] Oh, oh, oh. - As Mama Gepetto used to say, "There's no defense like a good offense." - Wait, Gepetto! Didn't you say you and the toys were strictly nonviolent? - Well, uh, there's always, uh, shades of gray, Josh. Like what Annie did back there in the courtyard. - Oh, that was nothing, just icing on the cake. - Unfortunately, icing alone won't be enough to defeat our unwanted visitor. That's why Josh and I are going into Nightmare Forest. - [Annie And Theo] Nightmare Forest! - Nightmare Forest? - Now, now, it's the only place I can possibly cook up something to deal with this Dr. Zoetrope. And after, we'll take care of him. Perhaps, we can get you back to this time pod you keep talking about. (sad instrumental music) - Annie. Hey, Annie. (sad instrumental music) Hey, Annie. - Hello. - Um, back there on the courtyard, well, you probably saved my life. - I had to. You were in danger and I care about you. - Well that's a very non-toy thing to say. Look, whatever Gepetto's got up his sleeve in this nightmare place, I'm sure it'll work out. - But I won't be with you. Toys can't enter Nightmare Forest. - Well, I'll come back, I promise. And then, then we can have some tea together. At least by then my clothes will be dry. - Can't you just move into the gingerbread house with us and live happily ever after? - Well, I'd like that a lot, Annie, but there's a time-displaced universe in jeopardy and it's gotta be saved. - Growl! (playful music) Here. - Oh, good idea. In case you two get lost, just leave a trail of these nuts and bolts behind you and that way you'll be able to find your way back to Toy World. - [Theo] Mm-hmm. - Thanks a lot, Theo. Where'd you get these anyway? - Oh. - I'm ready! (thuds) - Oh, oh, nevermind. - Well, goodbye, my friend. (rumbling) (slow dramatic music) - We'll have to make the rest of our journey on foot. Nightmare Forest is too dense for four-wheel transport. - [Josh] Nightmare Forest, huh? How'd it get the name? - Several reasons, actually, here's one of them. - Ugh, it's pretty gruesome. - Super Ninja model, 323, advanced hi-yah action. - You know, this place gives me the creeps. - Ah, Johnny Command play set, early model, prior to self-relubrication. (slow dramatic music) - You're gonna build a toy to battle Dr. Zoetrope, aren't you? - In a manner of speaking. - Oh, excellent! I mean, with all this stuff, we're halfway there. Oh, check this baby out. The Zapazoid BFG-9,000. Way cool, or what? - Oh, I'm afraid that thing falls decidedly in the what category. We are not here to rearm Toy World. - But you just that we were gonna take on Dr. Z with some totally cool, psycho-mutant power toy, right? - I said nothing of the sort. There's more than one way to, uh, skin a scoundrel, young boy, and my way does not include a Zapazoid. - Gepetto, your weapon disrupter shield may have put the kibosh on Zoetrope's blaster, but he's the most brilliant man in the 25th century. He's got about a million other tricks up his time-armored sleeve and the brain to use 'em. How are you gonna beat all that? - I'm sure I'll think of something, something nonviolent. - Come on, Gepetto. What's wrong with a little fight fire with fire? The universe is at stake here, and we've gotta fight for what we believe in. (slow tense music) - [Gepetto] Fire with fire, you say? - You bet. It's our duty to fight the good fight. - Where do you think you are, Josh? What do you think this Nightmare Forest is? It's a graveyard, one of thousands just like it. When there weren't enough people left to fight each other, they built attack bots to finish the job, except they built them too well, I'm afraid. And when the robots were done with the humans, they went after each other. - What about you? - Me? Uh, I was, uh, fortunate you might say. I built the most vicious killer toys on the face of the earth. It's true. Do you know what I felt when my mechanical army had conquered the land and I was the only non-toy left? Victorious? Triumphant? Because I had fought the good fight? No. I felt lonely, incredibly, horribly lonely. That's why I changed my ways, Josh, and changed all the toys into the fun-loving creatures you see today. Ultimately, war achieves nothing. Never has, never will. - Yeah. You're right, I don't need this thing. (boings) (laughs) You know, I do think, though, there are some things worth fighting for. Like the Nullifier. I've gotta do everything I can to keep those components from being put together. I've got to! - Well then perhaps we should each pursue our own method of defeating Dr. Zoetrope, huh? - Yeah, yeah, maybe. Look, you go, you go follow your plan, and I'll try and figure out my plan. - Sounds like a good plan. (birds hoot and chirp) (laughing) - Let's get going, you lazy toys and animals. Move it, move it! Come on, let's take up the slack. Let's get moving, you lazy toys! (yells) (whip snaps) Rollin', rollin', rollin', let's keep those toys a rollin'! Come on, let's move that wagon, boys! Let's go, ah! (whip snaps) Think of this as an exercise in discipline, my erstwhile equals. You get to exercise, I get to discipline. Hah! (laughs) (whip snaps) - Let's see what this primitive inventor has to offer the greatest intellect of the 25th century. Hmm. Possibly useful. A remote hologram projection device with a bizarre voice activated code. Crystal, crystal in my claw, where's the one I'm searching for? (tense instrumental music) Crystal, I think we'll widen out for a full shot. (tense instrumental music) Action Jack, adjust course to the following coordinates. (birds chirp) - Ah. Boy, a pink egg. (chuckles) That's something you don't see every day. (yells) (playful music) (chuckles) That was a close one. - [Theo] What? (Yells) (groans) - Don't ever sneak up on me like that again! - I'm sorry, I was just, uh-- - Look what you made me do! You think it's easy climbing trees to get all these eggs? Say, do you realize where you are? This is rather brave of you to venture this close in Nightmare Forest. - I thought perhaps I could help. - Oh, you did? Well that's wonderful, Theo. And it is brave, too. Come on, you can help me. We've got to stand by our friends, even if it's difficult or scary or. - Or we have to fight? - Yes, sometimes we even have to fight. I don't like it, but I know it's what we have to do when faced with evil. (gentle chiming music) (Theo softly talks) (playful music) (clicking) (playful music) - [Theo] Mmm. (thuds) (groans) - It slipped. Sorry. Hey, you're not eating that stuff, are you? - Uh, no, mm-mm. - Come over here and give me a hand. (playful music) - [Theo] What, what? - Push down on this spring here. (playful music) - Oh, oh. (thuds) (yells) (groans) Uh-oh. (groans) I'm sorry, I forgot we were-- - Um, look, uh, maybe you should go and help Josh, huh? - But I wanted to help you. - Well, you'll be helping me by helping Josh. He went that way. (footsteps crunch) (birds chirp) (Prism squeals) - Prism, Prism, get ahold of yourself. What's a matter, you're having an allergic reaction or something? (Azabeth chants) You are, you are having an allergic reaction to the vibrations of Azabeth's chanting. (chanting) Doesn't one of the 21 codes mention something about enough is enough? - Of course not. Kang never would have endorsed such a weakness of spirit. (chanting) Although, it may have been referred to in the 13th code. - May have? - We can never know, for number 13 is the lost code of Kang. (chanting in Kangian) (groans) (chanting) (dramatic instrumental music) - Oh, this is great. Gepetto tells me there's an old shortwave radio back at his tower in Toy World, and I figure maybe I can use it to communicate with the time pod, but, no, instead I get lost and have no idea as to where I'm going. There's got to be some way out of this crazy place. (dramatic instrumental music) (crunching) (dramatic instrumental music) (thuds) - Mmm, scrumptious. I would prefer a touch more rust, but uninvited guests shouldn't make much fuss. - G-G-Go ahead, y-you might as well have the rest of these. (yells) - Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are done. Now it's time for riddle fun. (tense music) Answer right, you'll learn the score. Answer wrong, you'll be no more. - [Josh] What's the question? - How do you think one would get to Toy World without the proper attire? - Well, I, uh. - Answer! - Okay, okay, just a second, I, I know this one. It's easy really. How does one get to Toy World? Oh, yeah, yeah, there's no doubt about it. It's to run! (exciting dramatic music) (laughing) (groans) (thuds) (exciting instrumental music) - Not bad, young friend, but you know the refrain, without pain there is no gain. (dramatic instrumental music) - Well isn't there some way we can talk this out? - Another riddle, you want? Until I shall rhyme, who would you wager is a warrior of time? - Warrior of time, let's see, uh, Zoetrope? - (laughs) Sorry, strike one. - Then it's gotta be Irwin, right? Yeah, Iriwn 1138. - (laughs) Nice try, strike two! - But there's no one else! (yells) (dramatic instrumental music) - (laughs) Time's up, little pup! - Just a second, okay? (yells) (dramatic music) Whoa, whoa, don't I get one more strike? - Ah, shall I truly be forced to follow this course? - Yes, a final request for the condemned is absolutely mandatory. Whoa. - Last chance, young friend. So do we attend, the one who is a warrior of time is the same one who arrived improperly attired, and he's staring into your eyes right now. - Yeah, but there's no one else here! Except you and, (dramatic music) and me. (zapping) (groans) - Good guess. (dramatic music) - How did you get there? - Josh, I've told you before. The universe is in peril and I must do all that is possible to save it. - Save it? Oh, jeez, first Mr. Troll and now you? Except Mr. Troll kind of went to pieces. - His job was done. He gave what you asked for. - Excuse me? I asked for that? A near death experience? - Your clue, remember? Evidently Nightmare Forest saw fit to send you one, albeit unconventionally. - Oh okay, so I'm some kind of warrior who doesn't know how to dress? Oh, now I understand everything. - Joshua, don't you wonder how you can still exist without your CDL bracelet? (tense music) - Yeah, every now and then. - It's impossible for you to be here without one. I believe that's the proper attire your frightful friend was referring to. - Yeah, but if it's impossible? - How can you still exist? There's only one possible answer, however improbable it may be, and that answer saved your neck a minute ago. - What are you saying? - You, Josh Kirby, you are a time warrior. - Oh, a time warrior, oh. - One in a billion, young Kirby, that's you. A mere mortal with the awesome ability to traverse the time stream with ease, even bend it at your own will. A gladiator whose arena is the temporal web itself. Unlike the other 999,999,999 of us, the molecules of your body are not time specific. Therefore, unlimited in their movement across the length and breadth of the time stream. It's quite remarkable, isn't it? What's even more remarkable is why nature would choose you to bestow such a profound a natural gift upon. That one really escapes me. Perhaps, it's connected to a pathetically high quotient of temporal immaturity. Your temporal senses are so undeveloped that they can fit in anywhere. - Then that's how I transported myself out of limbo. And that means I can zap myself to the time pod any time I want, right? - Unfortunately, Josh, although you do seem to possess the powers to utterly control the forces of time, they are subject to certain limitations. - Such as? - It's quite complicated. It has do to with chrono-quantum recharging, but those are limits you're going to have to discover on your own, kind of like a babe learning to walk for the first time. You see, even a time warrior whose powers are checked and balanced by the higher laws of the universe is a very powerful being indeed. That is why I'm offering you a deal. - You are? - Equal partnership. With my intellect and your mastery of time, we can reassemble the Nullifier posthaste. (dramatic music) - Do you really believe I would help you destroy everything that ever was, is, and will be? If you do, you're not as smart as you think you are. - That old imbecile Irvin 1138 is not trying to save the universe, he's trying to save his job, and he will do anything to achieve that. As long as the Nullifier component remains inactive, the Supreme Prefect controls everything and everyone. Join me and I'll prove it to you. I'm offering you a pact of ultimate power. (tense music) - Ah, what the heck? Maybe you're right, I mean, we could be some team. - I can see it now. Zoetrope and Kirby. - Oh, really? Well don't you think, uh, Kirby and Zoetrope kind of has a better ring to it? - No. - Well, I guess I might just have to reconsider. (dramatic music) - Well does that mean the deal's off? Pity, but a refusal was not entirely unexpected, as you can see. - No, wait, Dr. Zoetrope, I can't hang on! (groans) (dramatic music) - I really wish I could help you, Joshua, but as you probably figured out by now, I'm just a holographic image. - Oh, oh, this is bad. (groans) And this is worse. (dramatic music) All right, I've gotta do something. I'm a time warrior, right? Right, I, I hereby summon my powers to transport me to the time pod. (tense music) Okay, okay, maybe Zoetrope was wrong. Maybe I'm not a time anything. Maybe I'm just plain old Josh Kirby about to meet his maker. Oh! (dramatic instrumental music) If there's some way out of here, anything, somebody please show it to me. - I say, old bean, are you down there for the view? - What? The view sucks! Help me out! (exciting music) (groans) Solid ground, I'll never leave you again. Thanks a million, Theo. But, I thought Annie said toys couldn't enter Nightmare Forest. - I was just too hungry to keep up. (bells jingle) Hey, what's that? - I don't know, it sounds like sleigh bells. (bells jingle) - [Jack] Push, you weak-kneed little sissies! I'll whip the stuffing out of ya! Ha! (laughs) (whip snaps) (dramatic music) - Zoetrope. You know the way back to Toy World, right? - Like the back of my paw, mate. Oh, let's hustle! (dramatic instrumental music) (footsteps thud) (dramatic music) - He's gone. No sign of a body, no sign of the Nullifier component, nothing. - Hey, Doc, (chuckles) nothing escapes my new and improved plastic tracking ability. They are headed back to Toy World. - Blast it! I cannot allow Josh to escape with the Nullifier component again. - This Josh Kirby, this non-toy, is our friend. He only wants to get back home to where he belongs. It's that nasty maniac, Dr. Zoetrope, who's been causing all the problems. He's the one we have to watch out for. And furthermore, (exciting music) oh, Josh, my darling! You've come back to me! Oh, I've played this moment in my mind a thousand times, wondering what to say, how to express my feelings, and now that you're here it's so obvious there is but one true message for me to give from my heart to yours, you look awful. - Annie. - And you're kinda smelly. - Look, Annie, we don't have much time. Zoetrope will find us soon, so show me to Gepetto's tower, quick! (playful upbeat music) An old shortwave radio, there's got to be one around here somewhere. (clattering) (playful music) - I say, old chap, you mean this old thing? - Way to go, Theo! Oh, no, I should've known. What else would I find in Toy World? - Oh, don't be blue, Josh. This isn't the non-toy I've grown so fond of in so short a time. The Josh Kirby I've come to know is a scrappy non-toy who doesn't give up no matter what the odds. - Darn straight. You're right, Annie. Nobody's gonna laugh at Josh Kirby for giving up without a fight. (upbeat rhythmic music) - Oh, I've missed you too, Josh, but don't you think we should dance later? - Gepetto would never say he had a shortwave radio and mean a toy one, so there's got to be a real one somewhere. (playful rhythmic music) (Theo mumbles) (playful rhythmic music) - Does it look like this? (playful rhythmic music) - Oh! Oh, Annie, you're beautiful! (bells jingle) (sighs) - What's that sound. (whip snaps) (bells jingle) - Trouble. (toys groan) (dramatic music) - [Jack] Whoa! (toys groan) (sad music) Fall in! - I can't say much for your troops, Sergeant Jack. I'll take over from here. - Ah, give me a chance, my liege. All this lily-livered bunch needs is a little helping hand, a little incentive, (groaning) (squeaks) a little organization. Now you toys on my left, you're Infantry A, battering ram division. All you toys on my right, you're Infantry B, ladder squad. - Pardon me, sir, but we haven't a battering ram or a ladder. (toys groan) - Why don't you let me worry about that? (tense music) (toys groan) (playful fast music) - Theo, organize all the toys and get 'em to lock all the buildings. - Aye aye, Captain Josh. (playful fast music) - Here goes something. Attention, attention, this is Josh Kirby calling the time pod. Come in, time pod (static hums) (yells) (thuds) - Looks like Chuckles is all through chuckling. (laughs) (thuds) - Repeat, this is Josh Kirby. (static hums) Come in, time pod. (yelling) (gasps) - Holy Gepetto, this is terrible! (clattering) (yelling) Poor Chuckles! (yelling) (dramatic music) (whizzes) Yeah! Eat sugar, punk! - Mayday, mayday, this is a time stream SOS for Irwin, Azabeth, and Prism in the time pod. Can you hear me, time pod? Please respond! (static hums) (chanting) (rumbling) (sighs) - I'm afraid it's no use. (chanting) I said I'm afraid it's no use. (chanting) I said! (chanting) (sighs) I'm afraid the time may have come for us to continue the Nullifier quest without Josh Kirby. (chanting) (rumbling) (dramatic music) - Come on, get on with it. - Yes, sir! All right, troops, this way, come on. Let's go, let's go. (dramatic music) (soft chattering) - All right, Irwin, Azabeth, Prism, I know you're out there so answer. I've got another Nullifier component. I need you. The universe needs you! (clattering) Oh no. (tense music) (static scratches) Nothing. (playful dramatic music) I've been stuck in this cockamamie Toy World all day and it's been the worst 12 hours of my life! - [Annie] 11 hours, 59 minutes, and 35 seconds, to be exact. - Really? (playful dramatic music) - We toys wind up, run on batteries, springs, we have an excellent sense of time. - Look, Annie, I, uh, I didn't mean what I said. I-I-I just got frustrated. I'm just. (cuckoo clock chimes) - 12 hours, Josh. (beeps) (zinging) - Annie! Annie, it's working! - Josh, what's happening? - What did Zoetrope say? Quantum, quantum recharging? (beeps) Yeah, it's been exactly 12 hours since I used my powers to zap myself out of limbo! (beeping) (dramatic music) Annie, I need to get outside and higher. This signal's not strong enough! (beeping) (dramatic music) (soft chattering) - What are you up to, young Kirby? (dramatic music) - Yes! - Lieutenant Jack, on the roof! Primary target sighted! (dramatic music) - Infantry B! Routine 64, now! Come on, you three, you've just been drafted. In we go. Let's get to work! (claps) (chattering) (dramatic music) Pick up the pace, ya lazy muffin heads. This ain't no picnic. (chattering) (dramatic music) (beeping) - All right. This is Josh Kirby, time warrior, calling the time pod. Do you hear me? (static zings and beeps) I've got another component. Please, answer me! - Come on, get up there before I dismantle every one of you. Get up there! - How about some dessert? (gooey plopping) (playful music) (laughing) (playful music) (beeping) - We're holdin' off the forces of evil here, but we need some serious backup. Josh to the time pod! You've gotta come through for me! (chanting) - Booster rockets primed, chrono circuits set. (beeping) (chanting) (beeping) - Hello? Can you hear me out there? (beeping) - [Irwin] Will engage in 30 seconds. Prepare for the storm. - Irwin. (beeping) (tense music) All right, it's now or never, folks. Let's see what this time warrior stuff is all about. Come in time pod! (dramatic music) (zinging) Cool. - It's true. He is a time warrior. - [Josh] Hello? Come in time pod. (chanting) - Wait a minute. - What is it? - [Azabeth] Who turned down the radio? - Time pod doesn't have a (beeping) radio. - [Josh] Hello, hello! Josh to time pod, please answer! - Josh Kirby! - Astounding. Let me try and locate the source. Prism, Prism, assist me, quickly! (dramatic music) - Enough of this spectacle. (thuds) (yells) - Josh! - [Theo] Are you all right? - Thanks a lot, Theo, sorry about that. - There, there. (toys chatter) - No. - Josh, hand me the Nullifier component. - Never! - I'll get it for you myself, sir liege. (zinging) (toys gasp and cheer) - Come on, guys. (toys chatter) - [Zoetrope] Blast. - All right! - [Irwin] Josh, Josh, are you all right? - Never better, Irwin old pal. Looks like you came right in time. - Hey, infantry, let's attack this alien spaceship! Let's go, let's go! - What if we don't want to? - Excuse me? - Maybe we're tired of being your slaves. (soft chattering) - Do you have anything better to do? (playful music) - [Chuckles] Why, yes, I think we do. (playful music) ♫ We are the toys of Toy World - Oh, my, no! ♫ Happiness and joy world - Yes! ♫ A toy for every boy and girl ♫ In Toy World (playful music) (toys laugh) (Prism mumbles) - I fail to grasp the meaning of this ritual. - Catchy tune though. ♫ Happiness and joy world ♫ Toy World, Toy World ♫ Toy World (playful upbeat music) - Ah, I can't take it anymore! (thuds) - Oh! Oh, nice right hook! I mean paw. - Give me five. - [Annie] Josh, help me! - Turn off that music and give me the Nullifier, Josh, or this raggedy Annie gets a lot raggedier. (playful music) - Yeah, turn off the music. (music screeches) (toys groan) - The Nullifier, Josh, before I am forced to do something irreparable to this lovely toy. (dramatic music) (clicking) (clattering) - Gepetto! (exciting music) - Release that toy this instant, you brute. - Nice bluff, toy maker. Too bad we both know those weapons are useless under your energy field. - But they're not weapons, at least not in the conventional sense. (dramatic music) Bombs away! (toys cheer) - [Zoetrope] What's going on here? (playful music) (toys cheer) The next one that hits me! - Come on, get up and fight like toys! (playful music) (toys cheer) - Do you hear me? Do you hear me? (playful music) I'm coming for your first, pinhead. (playful music) (yelling and cheering) Stop it! Desist this this minute! This is gonna block my engines! Stop it! Josh Kirby, Josh Kirby! Stop this madness now! Will this do, Josh Kirby? You haven't seen the last of me. I swear it! (dramatic music) (zinging) (toys cheer and laugh) (playful music) - Uh-oh. (playful music) (toys laugh and cheer) (laughs) (gooey splattering) (playful music) (laughing) Perhaps the same sort of allergic reaction Prism had has affected this time and place. - Possibly. - [Rabbit] I'm gonna get you. (laughing) (playful music) (laughing) - And in recognition of countless acts of valor, executed in the name of friendship, I hereby declare you honorary toy. (cheering) (Jack groans) - Thanks a lot, Gepetto. Oh and try and cheer up, will ya? (laughs) (gentle music) You take care of yourself, Theo. - Cheerio, dear boy. (gentle music) - I'm gonna miss you most of all, Annie. - Oh, Josh, you're the only non-toy I've ever loved. (gentle music) - I think it's high time we departed. Don't you? - Let's hear it, toys! (cheering) - Thanks a lot, everyone. Toy World's been, well, different. (cheering) I'd love to stay, everyone, but there are three more of these deadly components to hunt down. (exciting music) - That is absolutely correct, and it is time for a reality check. Let's get a move on. - Nice to see you again, Azabeth. (exciting music) Bye, everyone! (exciting music) (toys cheer) - [Toy] Bye. - Bye. (exciting music) (swooshing) - A time warrior, are you certain? - That's what it looks like. I mean, it's not like I'm suddenly warlike or anything, but sending that radio message felt pretty cool. - A just and noble warrior always is cool headed, but in keeping with the fifth code of Kang, those who abandon the truth once may never find it again. Therefore, I must inform you that it was the telekinetic astral projections of my tech-warrior consciousness generated by the Kangian chant of the forlorn that reached out across the time stream and enabled you to contact us. - What? You, you've gotta be kidding. I mean, I fought a desperate fight against all odds to come up with some sort of communications device that my one in a billion time warrior powers could work on. And you're telling me-- - Would you two modulate your intercourse? If Josh is right, his newfound powers might prove invaluable to me, uh, I mean, us. - Yeah, yeah, wouldn't that be cool? If I could walk up to the time pod view window and look out and close my eyes and concentrate for a second, and then be able to open them and say, hey, Dr. Zoetrope's after us! - Huh, I suppose that would be a useful talent. - Then consider this a free preview, 'cause Zoetrope really is after us. (booming) - Commission the fissures to action! (zooming) Hang on everybody! (zooming) (dramatic music) Fear not, I think I've located a time stream escape route. Look, it's even locked for us. - Step on it, Irwin. Turn the pod around. - What? Zoetrope's right behind us. - Irwin, turn it around! (rumbling) (whistle blows) - Just because you're a time warrior, doesn't mean to say you know more about temporal navigation than I do! (dramatic music) We're not turning! - What are you waiting for? Go ahead and use one of your one in a billion time warrior powers and save us! (dramatic music) - Look, there's something about chrono-quantum recharging and a time limit. - Oh, well, I might have known. As the 15th code of Kang clearly states, if you lay claim to a title, be prepared to defend it at any hour of the day or night. (dramatic music) - Sorry. (train rumbles) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] On the next chapter of Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. (zooming) (zinging) (dramatic music) - [Azabeth] They're everywhere! - Hey, what are we gonna do? - I'm thinking, I'm thinking. - Well think harder, we're in trouble! (groans) - No! (zooming) - My beautiful time pod ruined. - You mean we're stuck here? (dramatic music) Azabeth, who's this clown? - This is Akira Storm, the keeper of the 21 codes of Kang. - Take them away. - Akira! - But you simply have to get us out of here. - I'll see what I can do. (booming) - Dreadnaught, the enslaver and his forces had us under constant siege. (booming) - You know what I want. The enslavement of your entire planet. (laughs) (yelling) (dramatic music) (zinging) - I cannot stand idly by as my friends rot away in some jail cell! You must release them. (yelling) (groans) It is a fight to the death. (yelling) (clanging) - [Josh] Fight to the death? (yelling) (clanging) You can't do it! (yells) (groans) (thuds) (dramatic music) (yells) (clanging) - [Azabeth] I hope Josh Kirby knows what he's doing. (booming) - I doubt very much that he knows what he's doing, but he has a plan nonetheless. - Scram! (dramatic music) - You realize if you fail, you're sending our last means of escape right into enemy hands? - Run! (dramatic music) - Relax, pal, I'm a time warrior. (exciting music) (MultiCom Jingle)
