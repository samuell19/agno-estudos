Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain [Alathur Sub-District School Youth Festival - 2002] The painting competition for U.P. section will begin shortly. Contas... Contestants should reach venue no.5 at the earliest. Next, I'll present an Ambassador car... Oops. Sorry. It was a Bullet bike. How was it? - Not bad. What about you? - My mimicry flopped. Hi. Fantastic work! I like it. It all starts with 'I like it'. Then comes, 'I love you'. Girls from good families are like that. - Is it? - Yes. Where is she? - Can't see her anywhere. Come. [indistinct chatter] Dude, she's from an English medium school! Yeah. It was very funny! An English medium student falling in love with a Malayalam medium student, has never happened in history. Hi Lilly. - Hi girls. Hi guys. How was the painting competition today? It was nice. Come. - I just completed my English recitation! Only English. Understand? Understand! - And I'm confident, I'll get the first prize. Didn't you try? Hi Manu. How did you know my name? - I know all that. Rahul, this is Manu. - Check out his style. He's like the boy from the Complan ad. - Hi Manu. I am Rahul. Lilly and me are classmates. By the way, you boys from which school? I've already seen you somewhere. You're done for! Say something in English in front of her, man! A for Apple. - India is my country. Manu, say something in English, man! I am a Complan boy! - Huh? Oh God! Complan boy, it seems. Didn't you get anything else to say? Leave it, Manu. She came and said 'I like it' to you, seeing your talent. And not because of English! My uncle in Tharoor? He works in a big company in Madras! He's not that educated. But do you know how he got the job? He paints really well, like you. That's what I said. Education doesn't matter. Your talent is enough, my friend. You'll become big! Then, we should get down from a Maruti car, in front of that Rahul. You want milk ice candy? Shall we go? - Come. Your talent is enough, my friend. You'll become big! Hey Manu. That protruding part came off! What can we do about the part that came off? Let's see Superb! Nothing more to say! Is it? You are too good! Oh no! Catch it! The paint! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! What is this? - I didn't do it on purpose. It was out of excitement. Excitement, it seems! But still, look at this. I am sure, Manu. With this talent of yours, you'll become really big! If you ever try to praise my talent, I'll kill you! Mind it! Hearing this, I flunked in 12th, though I had good marks in 10th grade. If I had passed, I could have gone to the Middle East and become successful there! These are all superstitions, Manu! Despite passing in 12th, did I become successful? You are so funny! Hello Complan boys! You haven't left this even now, huh? Rahul? What is he doing here? God loves us so much. We dreamt to get down in front of him like this. And who got down like that? Him. Moron! Rahul, when did you come from Bangalore? You felt like stopping, seeing us? That's so sweet. - I stopped to pee. That's when I saw you guys. Loser! 'Don't pee here' He always does things that he's not supposed to. I heard that you're getting married? - Yes. Well, I was going to call you... Your number. How are you guys standing here? Work ethics. - What? By the way, Vijay is designing your wedding card, right? How did you know that? 'One day you'll grow up to be like big bro' [Manoharan weds Lathika] Simple. But meaningful, right? Next to those incense sticks, if you keep a wreath as well, it would be awesome! Dude, I asked you to design my wedding card, not my funeral card! Change that black colour first. Hey! I can't change the black! Black is my favourite colour. It's my wedding, not yours! But how can I digress from my design aesthetics? And if you're so adamant, bro... Design it yourself, bro. If I knew how to do all this, why would I come to you? So don't give opinions about something you don't know! You're arrogant that you know how to design on a computer. Let me see if I can get this done, without your help. That's the spirit! I wish you a very happy married life! Hey Prabhu. Can I get some spathe? Spathe? - Yes. Of the areca palm. Get the kids who come to play, as well. Okay. Hey Irfan! All of you, come! - Come on, guys! Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain How is it? 'Manoharam' [Beautiful] Okay, right? - Yes, it's okay. I don't think the rice would be enough. I didn't expect so many people on the wedding eve. Come inside. All these are Manu's plans. Don't go there, kids. Yes, yes. Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing there? Get going! It doesn't taste so good, right? It's amazing. Your mindset isn't right! Look at you sitting there, hanging your tummy, loser! Then what! Hariyetta, look. These kids! What have they done? Whatever said and done, our Manoharan is really smart. He found a really educated girl, right? Prabhakaran, he's talking about your nephew! Yes, I heard it. Even though he's not educated, he found an educated girl. He must have gone there and said that, he's the nephew of Prabhakaran, the single-floor building owner at Chittilancheri! How else can he get such a good girl? That enthusiasm, he has! Oh! You were here? I can't hear you. - I was talking about your enthusiasm! Say it loudly! Enthusiasm! Enthusiasm! I can't hear you! Varghese, you should tell him the matter secretly. - I'll do it. Will we get some drinks? - It's ready. Come on. Where did he go? - He didn't call us. Manu! - There. Manu is on the mango tree! Manu, come down. There's a small problem. - What? Come down. Let me tell you something. I can't hear you, Varghese Etta. You can do that later. Come down. I must say this now. What? - Jesus! 2 minutes. I'll come now. I'll finish this and come. Dude, the girl you're going to marry? Lathika! - Keep quiet. She eloped with someone else! Yes. When did the music stop? Oh no! Chetta, it's okay. Why are you all looking? Lift him up. - Leave me. I am fine. No need to make him wear sandals. Come on! He is okay. Didn't he say that he is okay? Please go outside. - Yes. Over here. Lie down here. - Move, Chetta. Let him catch some breath. Go outside, all of you! What do you want to see here? Get going! Manu! Manu! No. I am fine. - He is fine. Don't make noise. He is fine! Hey! She had handed over a letter to Leela, to give it to you. She wrote a letter? - Then read it. Oops. I didn't see him! Can't you say this softly? The girl has written a letter for him, before eloping. Come, let's read it. Let's read the love letter. Push hard. Yes, like that. Come on! Come on, everyone. Read the letter. I won't allow that! All of you come inside. Don't take the letter. - I'll read it. No! No! Then you read it. - No! I'll punch your face! Read it. Read it. My dear Manuetta, I don't have anything against you. But the money you make by writing these boards and banners, won't even suffice to pay my mobile month of a month. The girl is clever. My parents won't understand all this. I have to make sure that my life is safe, right? So I'm going with someone, whom I think is safe for me. Wishing you a good day. Nice handwriting, right? Shut up! Ask her to get lost! Does she think you won't get a good girl? We'll find a good girl, and conduct this wedding. At the same time we fixed! Come on! Move! - We'll conduct it at the same time itself. Move! - Dude, no. It won't happen. I also know that it won't happen. Come! Come! Come fast. Stop! Stop! Saraswathi Chechi has a daughter, right? - Right. Call her. - I'll call her. Saraswathi Chechi.. - Who is it? - Ask her. He is our man. Ask him. - Baletta... Can you get your daughter married? - Get lost! If you're ready soon, we can leave with the girl. - I'll knock your teeth out. Why not, son? We can consider it. Manu from Gulf, right? No. Manu who's in our town. We don't want that Manu. Shall I thrash this old man? Let the dog loose. - Run! Run away! Escape! - Get out, you... Speaking nonsense coming home at midnight? Well, Manu who's in Gulf? Manu who's in Gulf, got a date stuck in his throat, and died. Manu... What happened? What's the point blaming the people here? Will anyone marry their daughter off to him, who paints on walls? When they ask, you should say that you're doing some business! Then you can start something after the wedding, pawning the girl's jewellery. That's how it is now, right? Manoharan! I told you when he was a baby itself, that such a name won't suit him. What are you waiting to watch? Come! What kind of a man is he? Sumathi, are you coming or not? Your uncle's dialogue after everything! It was like stabbing someone who's already dead! But what people are saying is right. Ever since these flex guys came, artists don't even have the value of beggars. Shut up. Did you see that board? Earlier, his father used to do all their works. At night, he smokes a Beedi... ... and sits on that bamboo ladder tied up on that board. When we look there after sunrise, Mammootty, Mohanlal and Shobhana, would be as colourful as ever, and they would be smiling at us. We've gasped wondering how he was able to do it. Do you guys feel so, seeing any of those boards printed on these flexes now? An artist is always an artist. That was long back, Varkey Etta... Now we can print Dulquer Salmaan, Nivin Pauly or even Nayanthara in any colour, within seconds, on a flex printer. And that feel of gasping you spoke about... That's what we have Photoshop for now, Varkey Etta. The one who knows it, is the king in this field now. I've been asking him to learn it for so long! Hey Manu. Who is it? Look. It's Lathika. Did she elope with him? Yes. We're on our way. So he ruined that design on purpose? Hello uncle. - Isn't he Rahul's cousin? Yes. I got him married. Everything was planned, uncle. Manu! - Hey Manu! Don't go! Wait. Hey! Don't go! Listen to me. Stop! Stop! Leave me. - What is this? They were all making a fool out of me, Varghese Etta. I want to ask.. I want to ask her what specialty he has, that I don't have. For that, what specialty do you have? If you had any specialty, would that girl ditch you? That boy she has married? He's a famous designer in the town, it seems. He's going to come here now. To this building of mine. Here! He's going to start the first flex printing unit in Chittilanchery. Both Vijay and Rahul together. They are really smart. I saw your message. I'm busy now. I'll call you back. Manu, our forefathers say that we should change with the times. There's no point if we continue to keep the shop like this. Keep it there. - Okay, Chetta. Manu, I was thinking... Already, you don't have much work. If a flex printing unit opens next door, you'll have to sit at home. Shall I say something? Can't you start such a flex printing unit here, before them? That's correct. They troubled you, right? You should trouble them back! What do you know, Varkey Etta? We'll have to spend a lot of money for that. Don't worry about money. - I'm not worried. Because I don't have money! It's not that. Varghese ettan will arrange it for you! Yes, Manu. Let's try it out. Have you gone crazy? Do you know how much a single flex printer costs? Will it be around 2-2.5 Lakhs? - No. Just around 25 Lakhs. Bye then, dear. It would cost 25 Lakhs? Shouldn't you say this first? Look! These are all Chinese brands. But they won't cost 25 Lakhs as you said. If we bargain, we can get it for Fifteen. Will it work? China isn't like earlier. Even Apple's iPhone is made in China now. Do you know that? Open it and... Wow! Right when I was speaking about Apple, here comes mangoes. Yes, Varghese Etta... - Manu... There's an Alibhai in Coimbatore. He updates old flex printers, apparently. Shall we try it out? Should we? - We should. I have to go to Coimbatore anyway. You also come. Call Prabhu as well. - No jack fruit, aunty? There are coconuts! Come and see! What is it? This way? - Yes. Go straight. Bro, Alibhai's shop? 'Are we in heaven, or are in a dream?' Bro, where is Alibhai's shop? - Don't know, Chetta. Where the hell is his shop? Alibhai's shop? - That side. Which side? I'm tired. - That side. How many cups of tea? 2 or 3? Give it. Bro, where is Alibhai's shop? It's over there. Varkey Etta, come. Bro, your MGR sunglasses are superb! No! No! I have conjunctivitis. It will spread! You better be careful. All that is superstition, right? Look at me! Did it spread? - Are you mad or what? Just like that... Please make him understand. I think this is it. Is this Alibhai's shop? Yes. This is it, bro. Come inside. Wow! Such a huge set-up! He's over there. Go ahead. - Welcome. Was it difficult to find the place? Bhai, we wanted to check out a machine... These are all ordered already. If you like it, I will repair this one and give you! Don't think that he's old. Back in the day, he was a tiger! The price is 4.5 Lakhs. I can start work only if I get the whole amount in advance. Because, its head alone costs 3 Lakhs. Then, the board and other things would cost 1 or 1.25 Lakhs. The balance 25,000 is my service charge. Brother! - What is it, dear? Just a minute. Who's on the line? - Don't know. It's a little risky. He's not talking about any warranty. The full price is 4.5 Lakhs. There's no risk, man. He has such a big set-up, right? No problem. - Not that. It's not about repairing the printer alone. Once it is repaired, we should take it, and hire someone to do the designing, right? Hire someone else? Manu, you should learn Photoshop yourself! I've been asking you to learn it for so long! This is cheap as well. This would cost around 10-15 Lakhs outside, and he's ready to give it to us for 4 Lakhs. You just learn that 'shop' he told about.. - Photoshop! Learn that, Manu. If he can take the girl you were supposed to marry, you should start a flex printing unit, at the same place where they were planning to open it. Chittilanchery's first flex printing unit should not be Rahul's. It should be yours. Well, what have you decided? Alibhai... We are ready, Alibhai. We need some time to arrange the money. Until then, don't give him to anyone else. Definitely not! Okay then. Bye then, bro. Thanks. What happened to my eye? What's your name? - Khushboo. Khushboo? I am Prabhu. Son, Prabhu? - Yes. Okay then. We'll come back to get the printer. Bye. Something has happened to my eye. What are you staring at? It's conjunctivitis. It will spread. That's just a lie. It won't spread. - You're superstitious if you say it won't spread. Move. - I won't move. You won't move? - It won't spread, son. This is so annoying. - Over here too. I'll sanction the loan within two weeks. Move everything else quickly, Manu. - Okay, Chetta. Thank you. Bye. Thanks. Varghese Etta... I spoke to my uncle. Rahul hasn't confirmed anything about the shop. One month... - It's okay. He has asked for a month's time. If we're able to pay the advance in between that, You'll be the boss. I'll be the assistant boss! Sorry! Sorry! Come on! Let's resolve his long standing complaint. Right, Varkey Etta? - What's his complaint? Oh! Photoshop! [Akshaya Computer Centre] Anyway, you've come at the right time, Manu. You can survive these days, only if you learn all this. An awesome person who can teach Photoshop, will join here tomorrow morning. Oh God! Sir, so tomorrow? - Okay. Go and come back tomorrow. Shall we go? Shall we leave then? - Get lost! When you have dust allergy &amp; a bald head, it's a big problem right? Manu, should we study here itself? Should we check a good place in the town? - No. Didn't he say that an awesome person who knows Photoshop is coming? It will be awesome. Malu, I don't know Photoshop. Sreeja, you've done MCA, right? You know all the other softwares as well. You can learn Photoshop later. Until you get another job, hold on here, claiming that you know all this. That's it. - But still? No buts! I've known Sudhi ettan from Kottayam itself. I'll show you how to deal with him now. So, as we agreed upon. Okay? It's not like we can't appoint more than one faculty, for all the different courses here. Instead we'll appoint one person who knows all softwares, for all courses. Isn't that heroism? Definitely! Thanks. You know all softwares, right? She knows much more than you mentioned, Sudhi Etta. Okay. So you can join tomorrow itself. Okay sir. Thank you. Mom, please bless me. There's enough inside your head, already! Now you want it outside as well? Ride carefully. Abish, Suresh, Rakesh, Rathish... There are a total of 6 students in the morning batch. And 5 of them have come to study 'Tally'. You know Tally, right? - Yes, sir. Then there's a guy who wants to learn Photoshop. Usually everyone come here to learn these accounting softwares. This is the first time someone is coming to learn Photoshop. So go ahead! All the best! Thank you, sir. That's why you look familiar. - Yes. My friend's house is close by. Good morning, Miss. - Good morning! I am Sreeja. I've come to teach 'Tally' to you all. Well, what about Photoshop? Photoshop as well! Teacher... - One minute. I'll do it. Fill whatever is in the gateway as I said. You have to enter the company name there. Note it down. Alt + F3 is the shortcut... Enter it only after you fill everything. You can add the company name in it. Didn't you do it yet? It's not that complicated. It's really simple. Do it step-by-step... like this. Note everything down while you do it. Teacher... - Type a company name first. Like this, right? Teacher! Just a minute. Now try doing it. Okay Miss. Teacher! - One minute! Teacher! That's correct. - Miss... Now teach him as well. - Yes, Miss. By then we'll sort this. Okay. Oh God! Sit down. Open Photoshop. Where is it? Which one is it? I don't know much about computers. So you don't know anything? So you should learn some basics, before learning Photoshop. By basics, you mean? There's a lot to learn as basics. Desktop, keyboard, mouse... Input devices, output devices, and so much more... Shall we start now itself? - Why not? What about this? - Just push it inside. Which is the brain of the computer? Correct. CPU. What is this? Yes. Keyboard. What about this? Mouse. So which all are the input devices? Good morning. Good morning, Miss. So today, let's learn about some accounting tools in Tally. Well, Miss? Basics! Miss? - Basics. Miss? - Basics. Basics... Basics... Basics... Basics! Miss? This Photoshop... Can I see it? Basics! So let's check the outstanding statement details once again. Teacher... Well, Teacher... We're stuck with basics for the past 2 weeks, right? So I had a small doubt. I thought I'll ask you. Shall I ask? Do you know Photoshop? No. - That's it! Do you have any shame? You're playing around with the valuable life of a young man! No, Manu. My situation was such. - What situation? Only you are in such situations? What about my situation for the past 2 weeks? Fooling common people like this to make money, is something great! Robbing people would be better than this! Sorry. I'm not coming there again. With the arrival of technology, there have been many job opportunities in our state. Where's the money that you owe me? - I'll give it later. I can't give it. We need to talk about some work places that have shut down, as well. Hey! - What is it? Hey! Where is this Manoharan's shop? (in broken Hindi) It's over there. Don't even know to read Malayalam? Hey! Who do you think you are? Are you happy now that you got that poor thing out of her job? Poor thing? Her? I was pleading with her to learn Photoshop for so long. And you know how arrogant she was to me? Her damn basics! Well Manoharan, you're also talking so arrogantly, right now. But actually, aren't you an innocent chap? Tell me! Aren't you an innocent chap? Slightly! - Then why are you doing such atrocities? If you don't learn Photoshop now, will the Police arrest you? Do you know how many problems that girl has in her house? This job was her only relief. People like you should be... Look at the guy who wants to learn Photoshop! What is it? Great! She is smart! Come on! Let a 6 drop! A 6 has dropped. - Wait. Let me play. Brother, where's the house of this girl called Sreeja? That soldier's daughter? That's not Sreeja. You keep quiet. - Brother! The one who studied in Bangalore! I've been seeing her since she was this small. The elder one is Sreeja, younger one is Parvathy. Keep quiet. - Why don't you bet then? - Okay. Mom, it's raining. Get the clothes. I'm taking a bath. Oh no! It's raining. It's gone? Phew! Is this Sreeja's house? I've come to meet Sreeja. Sit down, son. Shall I get you some water? No. Tea? - I don't want anything, aunty. Then, can you buy me a soda from that shop over there? For me! Sreeja! I have come to apologize. You won't have any problem because of me hereafter. You should come back to work, tomorrow itself. Okay then. Shall I go, aunty? Manu! Have some tea and go! Make it two, then. For me, as well. Did you shift here after your father died? Your mother said that you were in Chennai? - Yes. I never knew any of this, when dad was alive. There were celebrations everyday at home, with relatives, friends and everyone else. We came here thinking that they would all be there for us, when dad died. But... The stories are the same for everyone, in a way. Not just relatives.. There are other people in this village as well, right? Especially some people who know Photoshop! So let's learn Photoshop together, hereafter. Let's rock! [reading from text book] If you were this eager for your studies, my son would've been successful long back itself. Yes! Hey Prabhu! Love is like a newly opened Photoshop file. That means? Initially, it will be fully blank. But if a good artist applies his heart, he can create poetry in it! This is my friend from Chennai, Lakshmi. That's her husband, Shiva. When they come to Palakkad, if I don't show them the fort, it's too bad, right? - Yes. So the bride eloping on the wedding eve, and not being able to find any other girl in the village, was a big fortune! Isn't it, Prabhu? These are the blessings of his forefathers! Oh! So you haven't told her yet? Manu Etta, unconfessed love, is like an unsaved computer file. While working on it, we'll feel that we'll save it right away. But a virus attack will come out of the blue. - Correct. With that, whatever you did so far, would be destroyed! Yes, I've come out. I've taken the card. I'm in front of Akshaya itself. Where? - Go! - Shall I go say? Sree... - I'll be going now. I have to take mom to the doctor. And yeah... There's a good news, and a bad news! What? - I'll say the bad news first. 3 more students are coming to learn Photoshop, from next week. Now these YouTube lessons won't work. If I don't learn Photoshop somehow, I'll lose my job. What do we do about it? That's the good news! God has brought a perfect person for that, to me. Is it? - Yes. - Who is it? Yes. Here he is. He has promised that he'll teach me Photoshop within one week. Here's the card. I'll go book this. You can come slowly with your mom, Sree. Sree? Rahul, this is Manu. - I know him! We are family friends. Sree's father and my dad were thick friends. Almost like a family. Right, Sree? So you know each other? Then you guys talk. Let me go get my bag. Please don't mind. A beautiful girl who doesn't have a father, comes to my house, drenched in the rain, and asks me... 'Can you teach me Photoshop?' Why wouldn't I teach her? Who else would teach her Photoshop, other than me? And now, I live alone in my house. So, we're planning to start from tomorrow. Shall I go? Moron! I think Rahul was his wife in the previous birth. Whichever girl he tries to woo, he comes to give trouble immediately. He lives in Bangalore, right? Can't he find some girl from there? Why does he want to ruin this poor guy's life? Well, they have a huge set-up of multi-colour offset printing over there. His parents got bored over there. They want to come here now. That's why they're planning to start a flex unit here. As part of that, they've sent this rascal here now, to study the market here. That other scoundrel is with him, to help him out with that. Which scoundrel? - The guy who stole his first girl. That scoundrel. - Such great scoundrels! Don't take him too lightly. He took photos of those rooms and sent it to some people, even yesterday. Is it? He's big trouble, dude. Whatever he might be, if someone is starting a flex unit in Chittilanchery, it will be this Manu. But for that, you need to know what his plans are, first. You've got the best chance for that now. That means, you should also go with Sreeja, to learn Photoshop from him. Me? - Yes. To him? - Yes. To learn Photoshop? - Yes. Even my dog won't go! Didn't you hear him? Even if Sreeja likes him, she can't be blamed. Who will refuse, if they see such luxuries? Hey! You owe me a thanks. When I asked him yesterday if you can also come along, Rahul didn't agree initially. Then he agreed, only when I compelled him. Thanks. - Sreeja! Come. Ready. Sreeja, among all the image editing softwares present in the world today, Photoshop is the most powerful. Who doesn't know all that now, Rahul? We're expecting something more advanced from you. Then what about usual selection techniques - rectangular marquee tool, Lasso tool, Magnetic lasso tool, Polygonal Magic Wand tool, auto selection tool... Shall we learn some advanced techniques to edit images without the help of all these? This is not as easy as painting on walls. You need intelligence. Right, Sree? Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? You thought you could scare me saying the names of so many tools? There's a name that's shown first, while your Photoshop opens, Sitaraman. Do you know who he is? Do you know? He's from our neighbouring state. When he joined Adobe, he was just an assistant. But now? You are not that big yet, right? Don't go over-board! Sreeja, I know this scoundrel since childhood. There won't be a bigger ogler than him in this Panchayat. Leave Photoshop... Even if people hear that you came to his house to get oil, you can't have a bigger insult than that. We started learning this together, right? Let's figure it out together. Come, Sreeja. Sreeja! Come. There's something that wise men have said... 'Don't judge a book... ... by its cover'. Understood? - Yes. - Loser! What is it? Shall I teach you some extraction techniques? Well... As you said earlier, let's learn the simple tools first. Right? Dad, to start our unit in Chittilanchery as you said, that is the best place we've got. Didn't you see the WhatsApp video I sent? Now, if you see it in person, we can pay the advance for the room. Okay, Dad. You came early today? How did you do all this? I added a background layer, and cut and pasted the sun into it. Is it good? - Very nice. We can understand many things even if we check the help menu. Which tool did you use? - Sreeja! Just a minute. What is it? - You sit down. Did you see this laptop? - Is it new? I just bought this now. Did you see this? You can fold it any way you want! How do you do that? - Well... It has a touchscreen? Yes, you can touch too! - So we can use it like a tab! Of course. - Show me! Did you like it, Sree? Shivarametta, 7 Lakhs is too less. I was expecting at least 10 Lakhs. Manu, with the documents of your house, even this much amount was passed, in my own risk! I'm scared whether you'd be able to repay even this amount. Well... Go to the counter &amp; collect the cash, auspiciously. Okay. This Ottathara Prabhakaran can be really nasty. Tell it to that boy! I want the interest. - Yes, he is here. Who is he talking to? A big businessman who's related to me, is coming. Hang up. I'll call later. - Uncle! What's in the cover? Halwa? It's the advance for the shop. 2 Lakhs, as you asked. Where did you get this from? Sumathi, bring the key kept on the showcase! I'll come there in the evening, with the rent agreement. And yeah... The fact that I paid the advance for the shop... You know Rahul, right? Don't tell him. No! I'm not going to tell this to anyone! You also shouldn't tell anyone. - No! It's a big plan, right? I'm sure that you can't do it. That's why! Sumathi, keep this safely. We have to repay it soon. Don't lose it. Keep it safely. You have to give it back, right? See you! Do you want tea? - No! Good! Bloody Prabhakaran! It's like he's adamant that I shouldn't become successful. Loser! If you want to start it, it's on this side. I know. Get in. We should call someone to move all this textile shop stuff, and make them clean this place up, today itself. I have dust allergy. You continue to be ecstatic. I'll be outside.... Phew! So much dust! To be frank, I didn't expect that things would reach this stage, so quickly. Me too. Now I want to have a word with certain people! Who's that? If you go to 'Artistic' and select 'Pencil sketch', you'll get this effect. No. The other one is fine. Then just go to history, and select the old one. See! Don't you look like Aishwarya Rai? Stop it. - Which is this effect? Let me try. - This effect? Manu, how is it? Rahul did it. Anyone can do all this with effects on the computer. Other than the computer, can we bring these effects from some other planet? Why not? I can bring it from another planet! Give me a chance! Then do it. Sree.... Come here. I'll be right back. It's done. - Done? Come. How is it? - It's good. We're going to start a printing unit here. We'll be appointing some boys there for designing. You can also join them. - No need, man! I'm also going to start a printing unit. You know Prabhakaran Uncle's shop? I paid an advance for it. Wish him all the best, Rahul. All the best. Let me go then. I have some work at the shop. Shall I leave, Sree? There's a lot of work here. He won't do all that. Hey! Look at me! I am so fit, even at this age, right? I haven't felt so. You haven't? You are so fit even at this age! - That's what everyone says! But still, Sumathi... - What happened, Chetta? Nothing. You come. Come. What have you done, Chettan? Didn't we tell you that we'll take that room? You met Manoharan, right? You guys didn't call me after that, right? He brought the money as cash. So I just took it and kept. Here's 3 Lakhs. I'll pay a rent of 7000, instead of 6000. Give that room to me. I have already given you! That room was built for you only! Is it? - Sumathi! This is not to be returned. Ask Vasu to deposit it in the bank. I don't think Manu will be able to pull this off. No way, uncle! No way! Not happening! Just sit here and talk, Manoharan. Didn't I pay the entire amount you asked for, as advance? And how can you ask me to vacate the shop now? Flex printing is a big business. You can't do all that. That's why! Why can't I do that? I will do it. Ever since you took the money, signed the agreement and gave me the key, this shop is mine! If the sun rises on the day of 25th of this month, Manu will conduct the inauguration of the flex printing unit here. If I'm not able to do it, I will vacate this shop, at that very moment. Okay then. See you on the 25th. - See you! See you! I got a sense of excitement only now. We will rock it, Manu. [Opening shortly - Manoharam Digital Printers] Alibhai, here's the 4.5 Lakhs you asked for. Go confidently! As soon as the printer is ready, I will call you. 2500? - How long has it been, Manu? I will eat, mom. Keep it there. - Eat this. What's happening, Manu? Will it be sorted? I don't think this would go smoothly. We got a bank loan of 7 Lakhs. From that, we paid 2 Lakhs to my uncle. And 4.5 Lakhs to Alibhai. Rest what do we have? 50,000. Just for the interiors of the room, we would need 2 Lakhs. Apart from this, scanners, computers, UPS.... My head is splitting thinking about it. All this... Here. There is 2.5 Lakhs in it. I could arrange only this much for now. Bro, we're out of fuel. You should write the letter that girl wrote. We almost died laughing! I'll tell you the story of him falling from the mango tree, later. I was telling this girl... ... that I'm still not sure that you can do all this. Come, Sree. I just worked a bit on the character. We can keep this at the reception area. Didn't you do this that day? - Yes. I just worked some more on it. It's very nice. Manu Etta... I'll be right back. I think he's also very fit, like me. The printer would be kept here... Yes. Then it's fine. Okay then. Sree... Actually, will this business work out for you, Manu? Why do you ask so? Don't mind what my uncle said. He is mad! No, Manu. I didn't mean that. Do you know, Sree? I'm going to bring the latest technology printer here. Who else is more experienced to start such an institution in Chittilanchery, than me? Sree, there are no boards or walls here, that me and my father have not written or painted on. Wait &amp; watch, Sree. This will be really successful. Manu, I didn't mean that... - A very big success. Oh! It's Alibhai. Let me attend this call. Yes, Alibhai! - Manu... The printer is ready. Should we arrange a vehicle? - No. We'll bring the vehicle. Prabhu knows someone with a vehicle here. - Okay. Okay. [Singing a classic Malayalam song] How many more kilometers? What's that noise there? A crowd has gathered there. What is it? What happened? Alibhai cheated all of them, took all the money &amp; escaped from this city! Manu! Manu! Manu! Dude.. - Last night there was thunder &amp; lightning here. In that, the new heads attached to 3 printers, including ours, got damaged. Around Rs. 10-12 Lakhs was gone in a flash! The boards of a couple of them were also damaged. When he realized that he's in trouble, he absconded. - Absconded? The inauguration is day after tomorrow. We've told all the villagers too. What do we do now, Varghese Etta? I don't know. This happens every time for him! That day, his wedding. Now, this... Villagers got one more story to laugh about. What else can I say? His uncle would be happy anyway. Where is he going? Manu... We're taking this, Varkey Etta... For what? Other than selling it for scrap price, what can we do with it, Manu? Only we know that we can't do anything with this, right? Only we need to know that. - Correct. We'll conduct the printing unit's inauguration at the proposed time itself. Hey!... - We don't have any other option, Varkey Etta... I still don't think this is right, Manu. First of all, your time is not right. Now if we go there with this printer that doesn't work, are you planning to be a laughing stock in front of the villagers again? Let's go. What the hell is all this? Pour it properly. Ask if they need sugar or not. - Okay, Chetta. If you put all this together, shouldn't we ask if they need veg or non veg? We've sorted it separately. Prabhu, my hands &amp; legs are trembling. I can't stand or sit here. Just be cool, Varkey Etta. He wouldn't do this, without something in his mind! No. You eat it. Manu, tell him what your plan is! Or he'll die out of tension! Manu, this is not child's play. We've invited even the Panchayat president. If someone knows that this machine doesn't work? Just think about it. - My dear Varkey Etta, don't over-react. No one is going to know all that. Like all shops are inaugurated, this will also be inaugurated. The President will come and cut the ribbon... People will see this set-up, eat snacks and go their own ways. That's all. Simple! We should conduct the inauguration at the right time itself. Just think about that alone. Okay! - Come. Let's arrange the ribbon and stuff, for the inauguration. Mom, I've sent an auto. It will come now. Check if the length is fine. No need of a ribbon! These are all old traditions! I have told the President... ... that there won't be any ribbon-cutting. - Then? Such a shop is opening for the first time in our village. The inauguration should be by printing a flex, in front of everyone. President also said okay. How's that? Won't that be a big bang? - Yes, indeed. There would be a big bang indeed. Let me go tell this to everyone right away. Okay? Go and stop that girl. Hey! Ask him to open his mouth &amp; say something. Did you see him going inside the room? He's our boy! He has a plan for everything. Come! Manu! - Hey Manu! Manu, what's it Tell us your plan! We also want to know what you're going to do! Let him say it. Oh no! Manu! Manu? - Manu? Hey Manu? Manu? Manu! Hey! Manu, get up! - Varghese Etta... Is he dead? - Shut up! Manu, get up. The President is here. People have gathered. All our people are here. Get up! The inauguration is happening, of the press! It's the inauguration now. - Shop! Shop! Inauguration! Get up. - Manu, get up! Welcome, Ma'am. - Are you doing good? - Yes. Everything is ready, right? Shall we start? This is the designing section, Ma'am. Okay. These are all Manu's concepts. Manu made all these paintings. Manu... - The paintings are all great. Superb. Shall we start, Ma'am? - Yes. Manu, show her the printer. Come, Ma'am. Come. Move! Move! This is the printer. - Okay. It's a new model. - This is the first one in our village, right? Yes, Ma'am. - Now Manu can do all our election works, right? All of you have seen the printer, right? We've arranged tea &amp; snacks for everyone over there. Shall we go there? - Okay. Come! Well.. That? That can wait until the inauguration is over, Varghese Etta. Then let's go after the inauguration. - Are you ready, Manu? Come. It's time! Okay. Start! Come. - Manu... Switch it on! Manu... Make it fast! Just a minute. - It's okay. - Prabhu! Come. - Is he going to load a flex? - Yes. Why are you trembling? - No. It will be ready now. Varghese Etta... should I give the puffs after tea, or tea after the puffs? Get lost! - He is crazy! Prabhu, hold that sheet. Please move. 'Manoharam'. President is doing the inauguration. If you tell her which button to press, she will do it. The President will press somewhere... It will all go for a toss! Manu, which one should she press? Shall I press on the print icon? Isn't it okay? See! Clap! See! It's getting printed in colour! So all the best, Manu. You will have all our support. Chechi, come on smile! Thank you. - I am leaving then. Have tea and go, please. There's tea and puffs. All of you can go outside. Okay. See you. Where is Manu? I think he has gone inside with Varghese ettan. You rascal! Don't do as you please! If the printer is working, you should tell me. And don't make a fool! Varkey Etta, the printer isn't working. This is the print we got from Coimbatore. How did it come out of the printer? That's the suspense! - What we did earlier? Just a second. See if someone's coming from outside. Pull that lever up! Let's roll it. I thought we were really trapped. But when I got back to my senses, God gave me this idea suddenly. This head and board do not work. But if we press this switch, these rollers would roll, and the sheet would come out. There's no connection between this and the computer! Check now. Everyone was waiting for the print, right? I pressed this button then, without anyone noticing. When you sent him here itself, I had said that it's not possible. Now what happened? Some random guy! A schmuck who's too arrogant. He forced him to come home, and taught him Photoshop. Finally, he put this schmuck in some serious trouble! An institution in my own village. You ruined that dream of mine! What are you good for, other than destroying everything I made? Rahul! Rahul! Leave it, bro. He's your father, right? He's showing this anger, because he knows I won't talk back! This humiliation in front of everyone... That Manu is the reason for all this! He needn't shine here, making a fool out of me. Hop on! See you later. All of you came, right? Okay. Sit! Sit! Sit really tight! You needn't sit there like that! Come here. Hey! You think you fooled all the villagers? Do you think you can continue this game with this damaged machine? I can, Varkey Etta. Until we find a way to repair the printer, we will continue this. Not 'We'. You! If you're planning to continue this, you can get beaten by the people alone! There won't be any problem! I've spoken to the printers in Coimbatore. We will mail the orders that we get to them, after designing. They will print it and send it on a bus. We will collect it from the town, and without anyone knowing, we'll give it to customers, claiming that we've printed it here. How is it? - Like a bloody hotch-potch! You idiot! What will you do if someone comes in, and demands an immediate print? You are so negative! If something like that happens, we'll figure it out then. Manu... The first work is from me! Shall we print this right now? This is Akshaya's board. I designed it. Come, let's print it. - Why not? He will print it now. Right, Manu? Oh! Don't be negative. Be positive. Get it printed now itself &amp; go, okay? - Come. Shall we print it now? - No, Sreeja. Not now. Let's do it later. Not now. - Come. What's wrong if we do it now? Not now. - Why are you hesitant? Not now. - Please, Manu. It's my first design! Such a huge machine. Let me see it. Please, Manu. It's a wish of mine. Please agree. - Not because of that. What is it? - Leave that. The problem is that... The ink, you know? Printing ink? Yes. - It's over. We arranged only a little for the inauguration. So we can't print it now. Okay then. But you must call me when you print it. Of course! - Promise? - Sure! Thanks. Dear football lovers... At the valley of Veezhumala, with the blessings of Cherunatturi Bhagavathi, sending this Chittilanchery into a frenzy of excitement, the 6th Aattukandathil Ammukkutty memorial sevens football tournament, will have its exciting inaugural game, at Chittilanchery MNKM high school ground, tomorrow evening. Between the war horses of Chittilanchery, Chittilanchery tigers, and PSG Chittilanchery. - Hold it up fast. We're going live. Bro, is it live? It's live! It's live! Check it out. - Come on! Blast it! Oh wow! - Chittilanchery's thunder, Sura and his boys... From paper tigers to actual tigers! My dear people, the battle is on! The only one who knew to play among Chittilanchery Tigers, was this darling of ours. The PSG team has taken him! Him and his damn darling! - Listen to me. Calm down! Cool down! Cool down! - Cheers to Chittilanchery's Neymar, Shihab! Cheers to Chittilanchery's Neymar, Shihab! If that loser hadn't left, we would have thrown him out. Sura, no! This is our live video! You get going! Even we have live videos here! Let's go live! Let's go live. Switch on FB live! He thinks he is Neymar! He doesn't play well like earlier now. When he got more money, he left us, who helped him grow, and went with those guys! We didn't hear this dialogue all these days! All of you look! All of you come and see this. - Didn't you move this yet? If Neymar is our darling, Shihab is our asset. You idiot! Where's the new flex? I had told you to change it, right? You want to disgrace me? Suretta, just 5 minutes. We'll get it now. Live! Just 5 minutes! Within that, I will tie our new flex here! How much is it? - Rs. 210. Come between 10-10.30 Am tomorrow. - Okay. Will there be lunch? Here. Take the full amount as advance. Okay. Look at his attitude! Son.. - What? Get me that flex quickly. It's a bad scene there. I'll give it now. You can't even... - Suretta, I... Make some way! Prabhu... - Yes, Manu. Did the bus reach with the flex? That Sura is creating a ruckus here. The bus just came. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Come fast. What am I going to tell him? Hey! When you come, come through the backside of our building. I know. He is here. Suretta, I'm printing it. You can hear the sound, right? Go and bring it fast. - I'll give it now. Please sit. Hey! Hey! Come here! Is it done? Suretta, can you give me that bill? What is it, Prabhu? - Nothing, Chetta. Suretta, just 5 minutes. - What? 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 and 5 minutes. It's taking so long! Hey Prabhu! You still haven't stopped jumping over walls? I am Pathumuthu. - Is it? Pathumuthu Suhra, who studied with you in 8B. Hey! I've given my word on Facebook. Go and bring it fast. When the song 'Olanjali kuruvi' plays on TV, I think about you. I can never forget us making the flower arrangement in 8th grade together for Onam. I should have stopped studies in 7th grade itself. Someone is calling. Manu... - Prabhu, where are you? If it gets delayed anymore, they will kill me. I'm coming. My dear Pathu, I don't have the time for an extra-marital affair now. Not because I'm not interested. I don't have any other way. If I get some time, I'll call you. You pray for it. Don't say a word. You said 2 minutes! - It's ready! There's no compromise in the print's quality. - Open it. All of you please move. - Move! Shall I roll it out? Ready? My photo? Watermelon Sura? Your nickname? - It got switched! You bloody... - It got switched. Leave him! Suretta! Suretta! - What? The flex you wanted is being tied there. Look! 'The unwanted guy, is out!' Suretta! - You kept the promise I gave on Facebook! Oh Mother Mary! Manu, this game is getting serious! We must do something. Hey! - What was it? What is it, Manoharan? Walking like your bottom is on fire? Is anyone giving birth to a baby inside? Has he got rabies or what? Manu... Varkey Etta.. - Done? Done. Come! - Phew! Sunil Etta... Just turn that switch off. We can repair it, but you'll have to spend some money. We have to change the head &amp; 2 boards. Head alone would cost 3 Lakhs, and the boards would cost 2 Lakhs. Total 5 Lakhs? Yes. That would be the cost. Money? - Here's the money. Suniletta... I can repair the board, if you want me to. You can save around 1.5 Lakhs that way. But you must buy the head. Just let me know when the money is ready. Make it fast. I might get a chance to go abroad. That's why. Okay then. He's an expert. I found him after searching a lot. Before he leaves, we should arrange the money to buy the head. This one is Chinese. Fyonchuk Wangdu. This one is Arabic. Vishwetta... This is Burj Khalifa. If we light him from here, he will go half a mile up there &amp; explode! You didn't believe me? Come, I'll show you a sample. I was planning to launch it during next Thrissur Pooram. Is it such a big deal? Run! Him &amp; his damn Burj Khalifa! Would've got me killed now. - Vishwetta! Please take me too. - What happened? Half a mile, it seems. Half my body would have exploded now. I have a wife &amp; 2 kids. Do you know that? Namaste. - What is it? Well, about the flex printer... Oh! Manu? Come. The rights to keep advertisements at Velapparambu, has been taken up by the committee this time. Including those of the sponsors, there would be around 300 boards. I can get it printed from Nenmara. But now you're here, right? If you do this order well, then don't worry about work. I have more than enough with me. Here. Okay. Thank you, Vishwetta. Varkey Etta... We're saved, Varkey Etta. If he likes our work, all his works including his textile shop... ... will come to you. - This alone is enough. We can repair the printer easily! [Singing a classic Malayalam song] Now, I've started getting some hopes, Manu. [Singing continues] Didn't I ask you to call me when you print Akshaya's design? Sreeja, I thought about calling you only after it was printed. If you want, I'll print it once more for you. Do you want to see it? - Yes. I was kidding. - Phew! [Singing continues] The song is good, but the print doesn't have any quality, Manu. There might be a block in the Cyan Magenta print head. It wouldn't be so in a new printer, right? Can I see it? - I'll show you. No! No! Wait. What is it, Manu? - Well... We don't allow outsiders to the printing unit. If I had said so when you came to learn Photoshop, you wouldnâ€™t be here now. Did you hear me? Come! Pathetic. - What is this, Manu? Call him back. Rahul! It's okay. When everything is sorted, I will make her understand. How is it now? - Nice. Okay, right? - It's copied. Let's save it once more, with a lesser size. Send it to me as well. - What is this? Delete it. - Deleted! Give me your phone. - There's nothing in it. Come on, dude! I had warned you, right? Aren't you guys ashamed? For what you've done, I should hand you over to the police. Do one thing. For now... apologize to teacher, and go to your class. Go! Say sorry! Sorry, teacher. Walk! Walk! - We're saved, bro! What have you done, sir? Sreeja, they are kids. Let it go! Moreover, we formatted their phones, right? Sorry sir. It's difficult for me to teach such kids. If you say so, it will be difficult for you. Here, getting students is only difficult. Getting teachers is not difficult at all. Let her go if she wants to. Ask him to get lost. What you did was right. Let's search for some other job. Well, why don't you join Manu's shop? What is it? - Nothing. Chetta... - Manu! Hi! - It seems like trouble. You are so negative! What is it? You didn't say anything. Well... Appointing Sreeja as a designer, is a good thing. But... I can talk to Sudheendran of Akshaya once more. I'm really close to him. That's not necessary. We came to ask if she could join your shop. If you can't, no need. Come! Sreeja! He doesn't like you as you think! Otherwise, in such a situation, which lover in the world would say no? Maybe, he wouldn't be getting enough works, to appoint one more person. He might be hesitant to say that. You continue being so naive. But you could have let her join you! You should say this, after knowing everything! Already, she doubts whether I can do all this. Now if she comes to the shop, and understands what happens there, that will be it. - That's true. But your good intentions, shouldn't give you trouble finally, Manu. That won't happen. We're going to get her a better job now, right? Where? Have you come to play cricket with the kids? Huh? This guy? Vishwettan has many institutions, right? If he helps us, we can easily get a job for Sreeja in one of his institutions. As if he has kept a job ready there, as soon as we go! There you go! Please be positive, Varkey Etta. Manu, I was going to call you. Did you see the positive symptoms? That means? - Positive signs! The matter for our boards are all ready. Just go to the committee office. I was going to call you for something else. I have a nephew. He has a craze for designing. - Is it? Vimal! - Yes. Come! - Hey! Hold this. Let him work as a designer for some time in your shop, right? It's good to gain some experience, right? - Of course! That's very good. Look at your positive sim-som coming! Hey! This is.. - I know Manu ettan, uncle. Vijay ettan eloped with the girl Manu ettan was supposed to marry, right? I am Vijay ettan's main man! Oh no! We lost a wicket. - Okay Manu Etta. See you at the shop. Is your system Windows or Mac, at the shop? Windows. - Sheesh! It's Windows? Aren't you coming then? - I will come. But I will be on leave on Monday. I'll join on Tuesday. So let me go. See you! Shafi, I will bat. See! He is really smart. Okay then. Shall we go? Hey Manu! Being positive is a good thing. But if the tail at the bottom of '+' grows a little longer, it will become something else. Do you know what that is? What? - A cross! That's what you're carrying now! It's okay. We'll let it hang somewhere. If he knows what we do here, and says it to Vishwettan, all our plans would go for a toss! Stop biting that. Bite mine. It's been long since I cut it. Manu Etta, can't you install an AC here? I've ordered it. Until then, you can go and sit at home if you want to. That's not necessary. When I feel hot, our printing room has AC, right? I'll sit there. Manu Etta, did you learn Photoshop from Rahul ettan? - Yes. Do you know him? - Of course! We both are thick friends. That's amazing! Shall I kill this guy? - Do whatever! It didn't work out. I've attended a couple more interviews. Let's see what happens. Okay then. Chetta! Chetta! Chetta, just a minute. Sreeja, I was just thinking about you. What is he doing here? Move! Sreeja, Vishwettan sent him here... You should fire him right now. Well... To fire him... We've taken up Vishwettan's works... - Can you do it or not? Well... I've got a lot of work... Sreeja! Sreeja! - Yeah, right! Sreeja! - Ask her to get lost, Manu Etta! You get lost! Get out of here! I'll show you. - What will you show? See you! - Get lost! You get lost! - Get going! Hello! Uncle? - Are we in trouble? It's not late yet. Tell her everything that happened. And clear all the misconceptions. Go! Shall we go? Don't stop. Come. - Sreeja! Hey! You can't leave the bike here. - One minute. Sreeja! Sreeja! I could've talked to him, right? Yes, Vishwetta. I'll come now. He's coming. Go and get it! - Manu... Everyone here is saying that your printing is bad. So we're giving it to a different team. - Vishwetta... I'll give you the best quality prints, compared to anyone else. That's my promise. Please, Vishwetta. You must give me this order. Please! You do one thing. Print the main flex to be kept on the stage, for the inauguration of the 'Arts night'. If it is okay, I'll give the order to you. Okay Vishwetta. Thanks. What? Are you done tying it? The print is superb! The rate is slightly high. But still it's okay. When I called and told them, they started printing well. You know what will happen if we don't get this order, right? Hold this. I hope he likes the print. It's Vishwettan. Manu, I forgot to call you in between all the hurry. That rascal who promised to come for inauguration has ditched us. Instead, that actor from Ottappalam... That Aanandan. He has promised to come. So you should print the flex with his name. And yeah, the programme is today. Don't forget that. The guy who's inaugurating.. - Is he dead? No. It's someone else now. Don't worry. First, you mail our new design to Coimbatore. One more set of prints have to come in the evening from there, right? Ask them to send it with that. Phew! That's a lot. - Keep it. This is not enough. - I don't have money. It's okay. We have to meet again, right? That's enough. I don't have money. Yes, Manu. I've got it. The banner is here. Everything is here. - Okay. Yes, Malathi.. - We have to meet you. Sreeja wants to talk to you about something. Can you come to the shop? Here, we can be free. Are you happy now? But Sree... I'm telling you again. I somehow don't think this is right. There's no scope for one more printing unit at Chittilanchery centre. But your dad wished for an institution in his own town, right? Rahul! - What is it? There is some game behind this. I've seen him going like this earlier too. Rahul, get the bike. Hey! It's him! Go fast! Go! Go fast! Isn't it done yet? Vishwetta, the banner hasn't come yet. It hasn't? - No. Come with me. Hey! That trailer! He overtook it. Where did he go? Go fast. He would get away! Where is he? Shucks! I saw him going! - He got away? Where? Can't find him! He must have gotten away. Sweetheart! Nothing happened, right? Have it. - Hey! Trying to escape after hitting him? Take him to the hospital. - I didn't hit him. Ask him! Did I hit you? - You did. My bike hasn't hit him. Why are you crying? - I saw him hitting him with the bike. If you lie like this, you'll go to hell, boy. Don't touch me! Take the kid to the hospital. - I haven't done anything. My bag is on the bike! - Get inside, I say! My bag! My bag! My bag! - Trying to jump out? My bag! And where are you now? - I'm still in the hospital with that kid. That little rascal has no problem. I don't understand why he's lying in the ICU now. Since the MRI scanner here is not working, they made me take all the scans except that. I don't know what's happening here. That little scoundrel is a psycho! Psycho! Here. This bill as well. Bill? - Push it fast. Chechi, I'm not related to him. I don't know who he is. Prabhu... Vishwettan is calling. I'll call you back. Manu, what's happening? - Just 10 minutes. I'll bring it now. You don't have to bring it. I'm coming there. By the time I reach, keep the banner ready. Manoharan, I need some flexes to put on top of the hen-coop at home. Not of politicians, but of movie stars. The chicken shouldn't be scared, right? Manu, are you trying to fool me? Vishwetta, it's almost done. Just 5 minutes. Please wait. He's printing a flex for my hen-coop. What's the matter? Try calling him. - Sit here, Vishwan. Isn't the owner here? - He is inside, printing a flex for a hen-coop. Vishwetta, the print is ready. Look! See! Chetta, your flex is here. Come and take it. So strange, right? So all these are not printed here? How? Didn't I tell you, Vishwetta? This is a fraud set-up! Is it true? Aren't you printing here? You bloody scoundrel! You were making a fool out of me for so long? What did you think? That you could cheat me? It's not like what you think. - There's nothing to think now. Forget about that order! Don't think you can get orders from this village, after trying to fool Vishwan! Let the festival get over. I'll be seeing you soon. What happened? - Rameshan! What's the problem? He brought the President here for a grand inauguration, and tried to cheat the people. We caught him red-handed. - Who cheated people here? What else should we call this, other than cheating? I told you that day itself, that you can't do all this. So you answered back at me! If you're a man of your word, you should leave now! If so, I'll take this room right away. The same advance we fixed then. The same rent. Did you hear that? Now stop your drama, and vacate the shop. I don't want such frauds here. - Uncle! Let's go! Couldn't you tell me all this then itself? I could have. Yes, you could have. Then why didn't you say it? You said that I can't do business, right? Now it's proved, right? Don't interrupt! Yes, I had said so. I still say so. This business is not meant for you, Manu. You are an artist. When I said it that day, you took it completely in a wrong sense. The reason for that is your... Complex! Inferiority complex! Going crazy with that, has led to all this that happened. Who has complex? Who? This is the advance money. I've taken Rs. 10,000 from this as labour charges. Here. - You keep it. I'll take it later. - Keep it, Varkey Etta. All the best! Thank you. - Okay then. I'll give the orders for all the flexes for the festival, to you. I trust you guys. Anyway, all the best. Thank you. Hey! This is your first bulk order. Don't bring shame to me. So Sreeja, you can start from next month as our software testing trainee. Congratulations. Got it. I've been asked to join from next month. The posting would be here at Chennai only. Sree, I'm still upset that you didn't come for my inauguration. But I need a help from you. Consider it as a reward for your teacher. We're doing all the works of the festival. So, until the rush is over, if you could help us out with designing, Won't you come, Sree? You should come. To default the first payment itself.. Not possible, Manu. Not possible! Didn't I tell you then itself? She has got a good job in Chennai, it seems. She told Prabhu that she would shift there, after the festival. Now, she's helping out, because Rahul compelled her. What the hell have you done? This won't work! Didn't you show me a design that day? I want it exactly like that. Do it. If I move the necklace here.. - Manu had shown him some design earlier... He wants it exactly like that. He doesn't know that the owner has changed. Many people have been saying this now. - Necklace! Damn it! Hey! Appoint someone who knows the job! Wasted my time in vain! Vishwan, this won't work. Back then, they were doing it properly. I want it only like that. Or I'll cancel all their orders. Tell them. Joyetta, let me explain. - You needn't say anything. This won't work. Start the car! He's our main sponsor. If he backs out, everyone else will back out. What is the problem? He didn't like the design. He said the earlier ones were okay. Yes, but it wasn't us who did it. Then who was it? This is the house. - Is it? Manu! I gave you an amount as an advance that day, right? Vishwetta, that... - I haven't come to ask for it. It's okay even if you don't return it. But, in return, you can do something. It's nothing else. Until the festival is over, you should work as a designer at their new shop. All those who come there, want your designs, Manu. Bygones are bygones. It's pointless to talk about it. Anyway, please try to come, Manu. Think about it and tell me. Don't make it late. Shall we go? How much did you take as an advance then? I will arrange that. You don't have to go. Yeah, right! - Okay. Long back, people used to come from afar, searching for your father. To get boards done. Everyone used to say that if your father does it, it will have a special charm. Today, when they came looking for you, I remembered that. You should go, Manu. Don't think that it's insulting. Your talent is your way! It will never betray you. It's really funny. He's going to come here as a designer. What's wrong with you, Rahul? He has tonnes of complexes. Him working as a designer here? Don't even dream about... Manu, please come. Didn't you say that...? - Bye. Come, sit. Rahul, show him Joyettan's designs. Please check them, Manu. Move the bills of whatever is done. I did it roughly. You can make some changes if you want to. Manu! Delete that whole file itself! And start afresh! Let me see. This is not good enough, Joy. It should be more colourful. We're giving as much money as you asked, right? So why can't you add a couple more colours? Well... - Let me see. True, Ichaya. The designs are not good enough. Check this out. True. Pink would have been better. - Check this. That necklace is not matching the model. - She's not smiling. This is not at all matching. Nice! Simple, but interesting. Are there people who design like this in our town? True. - It's good. I also felt so. See! Now this girl is smiling! - Yes, Manu. - I showed the designs to Joy sir. All of them liked it. - Is it? Superb! Good job! Learn from him! Chetta... - No. Let him do it. Then you can come. - No. Let him do it. In the list that I gave, there are 18 main sponsors, right? Their boards alone, should be kept on either side here. Fix the rest of the boards all around the festival ground, leaving gaps in between. Rahul, you are in charge of everything. You know the festival rush, right? Only one more day is left. I'll reach here on the day of the festival, at dawn, before it starts. All the boards should be here by then. The parties got late in giving the designs. Or we could have printed it earlier. But it's okay. We can finish everything within today &amp; tomorrow. The boards will be up, right on time. There won't be anymore buses. It's okay. I'll catch an auto rickshaw. Auto! Auto! Auto! Auto! Auto! Auto! It didn't stop. I never expected that you would come here as a designer, Manu. I heard that you got a job in Chennai? Yes. I will leave after the festival. It's a good company. Leijing Multimedia. Manu... I... Do you want a ride? - Yes. Manu... See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. If you listen to your mother in certain things, this is what happens. My mom is superb! Couldn't you give me such advices from childhood itself? I did. Just that you started listening to them only now. What happened? She said we'll meet tomorrow. For what? - I'll know that only tomorrow. Stop! Stop! Manu! Manu! I've been calling you for so long. Why aren't you picking up your phone? I didn't see it. What happened? - Look who has come. I am in Palakkad now. I'll be coming to Thrissur from here. Okay? Manu, you thought I cheated you &amp; escaped? He has come with everything to repair our printer. I had a property back in my hometown. I needed some time to sell it and sort everything. But if I had said that then, you wouldn't have believed me. That's why I left without telling anyone. But I have a much more advanced head in here now. You can even print on cloth now. Consider it a penance from me. Why are you still dull, Manu? There's a vacant room at Qatar Shahjahan's building. Let's start our shop there! Alibhai, I'm really happy that you came. But... I don't want to start another unit again. Manu! - Go! What is it, Bhai? Don't take any hasty decisions. Until then, let this be here. Tell Manu. - Okay. Manu! Hey! Don't do as you please! Shouldn't you be responsible? Is this how you do things? Do you have any idea how many Lakhs this costs? What happened? - The printer's main board is damaged. A print was being made, but Sreeja made a blunder in between. Don't say anything. I saw a spark coming when you plugged it in! These are sensitive machines. Handling it so carelessly, that too at such a crucial time! The technicians would reach only tomorrow morning. We have to make prints for the whole day today, and more. If the boards are not up at the festival ground tomorrow morning, we'll be in trouble. Why did you even try to plug it in? Rahul, it has happened. What's the point in saying it again &amp; again? I can't stay calm thinking it has happened. This is not like your designing, sitting in front of a computer. We have to finish printing these by today evening. Can you do it? - Dude... Can't we print it from outside? When a machine has trouble, everyone does this, right? I tried calling everyone in Palakkad &amp; Coimbatore. None of them can deliver it today itself. So much square feet, right? We can't even split it up and give them, because it's the festival season. When you're asked to design, you should do that. Instead, don't touch unnecessary things! Do you know how much money we'll lose? Rahul, you won't lose anything. Someone who can print it the way you want, within the time specified... I know such a man. Varkey Etta.. Alibhai would've reached where now? Why? Hey Prabhu! Come here. Move this. Okay, right? Wait. Just a minute. Manu, will Alibhai reach soon? Only if he comes &amp; fixes this, our plans would work. Nothing to worry. He has gone to Thrissur. He said he'll take a cab &amp; come fast. Come. - Okay. It's 10.30 AM now. Just one hour. Within that, Bhai would reach here. Bhai said that he needs only 1.5 hours to fix all the spares, right? That means, we can start printing by 1 or 1.15 PM. According to what Rahul said, we'll be able to finish all those prints by 10.30 PM in the night. If everything goes well... by dawn tomorrow, the festival ground will be full of our boards. Right? - No need of any planning. This is the way before us now. Let's try going on it. That's all. Let's see. Yes, Rahul. - What happened, Manu? Will they print it for us? - Why not? I am with them now. Who are these guys? - You just need the prints, right? So they don't know that we're printing from here? It's strange! Once you lost this work, and finally it did the rounds &amp; came back to you. Nellikkulathu Goddess had decided that you yourself should do this work. Manu, I've asked them to send ink &amp; materials from Coimbatore on a bus. You should send someone to collect it from Palakkad. I'll reach there within one hour, maximum. Start the vehicle! Let's go. Sreeja! I've copied all the designs. - Don't worry, Sreeja. We can deliver the prints on the promised time. Varkey Etta.. - I'll come there. You go! Sudhi, we need 100 10X10 frames. Sudhi, get the big ones ready first. What's happening? - The frame work is going on. The boards will be up, at the specified time itself. Okay. - Hey Manu! Oh no! That means trouble! Sir, I don't think this block would clear anytime soon. It's such a huge block! What do we do now, Manu? It's Alibhai. Alibhai! - Hello! Hello! Manu! I don't have much signal here. I think it will take a long time for this block to get cleared. I don't know what to do now. Hello? Hello? Manu!! Alibhai... Can I fit all these things into it? If you ask me so... I can! I'll return it as soon as I'm done. Thanks a lot. - Whatever you have. Manu, catch this as well. Son, we have only these. Is this fine? I don't need this, Chechi. It's okay. Or just give it. Can't say what would come in handy. Give all that to me. - Don't drop them. Stop! Stop! It's heavy! Have you removed all the cables? There will be 5 screws in the head-plate. - What's happening? Take those 5 out. The screws would be really tight. You must apply some force on them. - Okay Alibhai. This will be awesome. Do it slowly. Have you taken all the screws out? Slowly.. - I'm removing them. The last one? Shall I take that one also out? You should take that also out. - Okay. Ready! I've taken them, Alibhai. Now you should remove all the damaged heads in there. First, you take out all the cables on the head. Manu, this is not a flex. This looks like cloth! Which age are you living in? Flexes are all going to be banned. Now, cloth would be the new trend. You're installing the advanced technology which would make you print on cloth too. Alibhai... - Yes. I'm getting a call. Please stay on line. - Okay. Manu, the frames are all ready here. Start sending the prints that are done, right away. Only then can we get the boards up on time. Alibhai, tell me. The prints will come now. Finish this by then. Chechi, what's the matter? He's repairing that machine. He's repairing the machine! Machine! - It's 1.30 PM already. It will get done, only if we start printing now. Or everything will go for a toss! It is tight. Alibhai, I've fixed both the boards. - Very good. Now you should fix the head &amp; cables. It will be in the box. Take it. Box? - You should be most careful now, Manu. The head is really sensitive. A little bit of carelessness would make you lose Lakhs. Listen to me carefully. Don't be scared. You should fix all the 8 heads to its corresponding slots. Then, there are three cables, from the board to the head. Data cable, power cable, combolux cable. Be careful that they don't get interchanged. If they get interchanged... - If they do? You'll be in deep trouble! Careful. Okay, come. Why isn't he picking up? This is some game, Rahul. I felt doubtful right when he didnâ€™t say where he was printing it. And we know all the printing units here, don't we? It's the festival season. Everyone will be busy with work. Can't be done anywhere. So you know that we won't get it anywhere, right? Then let us just trust Manu. Try once more. Rahul, did you know? Hello? Alibhai? Alibhai, can you hear me? Have we lost the signal now? No. It's difficult to get signal at Kuthiran. Try calling him. - I'm trying. Shall we fix it ourselves, Manu? Has the cable reached? - Yes. Is it okay? Let me try to call Alibhai once more. Can't reach him? Shall we switch it on and see? Oh God! - Oh! Rahul is here. Prabhu, go connect the plug. Great! Are you crazy or what? You said you'll print on this? Why does it matter? You just want prints, right? - Then where is it? It will come now. - Varghese Etta... Come. What are they doing? - I don't know. Take it. Keep it that side. Keep it over there. Switch it on! - I've switched it on. Isn't it turning on? - What happened? - It's not turning on. Press it once more &amp; try switching it on. Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain I should be blamed for trusting you. What do I do now? Didn't I tell you not to give him this job? Now what happened? Stop watching his madness, and come with me! Rahul, please. What you said is right! He has tonnes of complexes. He has gone mad with all those complexes. What did you say? - Complex! You've gone mad due to those complexes. Not complex. Combolux! Hey We forgot to connect a cable that Bhai told us about. - Which one? There are 3 cables from the board to the head. Data cable, power cable, and combolux cable. Combolux cable. Stop! Stop! Nothing will happen! It won't work! Now you understood that complex is not such a bad thing after all, right? Happy now? - Thanks, Manu. Don't worry, Rahul. The boards will be up at the festival ground, at the specified time itself. Rahul, awesome job! So many boards from the committee, at the festival board... That too, when you printed it on cloth, at the rate we fixed, I got really shocked! I've bragged to the media that we've avoided plastic, and this is an Eco-friendly festival. All the credit goes to you. Not me, Vishwetta. It's him. These were all printed on Manu's printer. Awesome, Manu. Forgive this Vishwettan. Vishwetta, there is nothing like that. There is. The word I gave you that day... Hereafter, all the works from my side, would come to you! Business won't work for me, Vishwetta. If you have any works, you should give it to them. Why, Manu? When you own such a great printer? I've given it to Prabhu. He's going to start a printing unit on his own at Palakkad. So avoiding all this, are you going on an exile or what? The exile is over, right? Now, it's the crowning ceremony! Mr. Manu, welcome to Leijing Multimedia. At Leijing Multimedia? - Yes. Our Sreeja is working there, right? They are the no.1 game developers in the world. I've tried there once. But I didn't get the job. How did Manu get a job there? Lilly. - Lilly? Hey Rahul! This is Manu! Are there people who design like this in our town? So the design is fixed. - Thank you, sir. Excuse me. Aren't you Manu? Hey Complan boy! I am Lilly. Fantastic work. I like it. I never saw you after 10th grade. Do you still do paintings? So guys... This is Manu. Our new character division head. Believe me! He is a fantastic artist. I was floored seeing his character sketches, while we were in school itself. And after so many years, we met at a really unexpected situation. Upon my demand that day, Manu had sent me some character sketches. And the good news is... Our new game project was approved because of those same character sketches. So, thanks to Manu. And I'm sure he can create wonders in all our upcoming projects. Welcome to Leijing multimedia. All the best. Manu... Come. I'll show you the cabin. Come! Hey! Is this Lilly Madam married? Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain
