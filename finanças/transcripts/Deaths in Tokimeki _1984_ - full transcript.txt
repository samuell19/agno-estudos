Eliminate \k75}who {\k80}is {\k74}useless {\k78}to {\k74}our {\k342}organization. Deaths in Tokimeki Are you Mr. Kudou? I am. Pleased to meet you. I'm Ookura. Shall we go, sir? Take my bag... Where did you come from? What did you come here to do? - The weather is nice and cool. - It sure is. It was raining until just now. Even nature calms down when submerged. Is it a nice village? Who can say? I only recently got this job myself. - It's nice and quiet, though. - Nothing too wild, then? They don't get too upset when a dead body turns up in the ocean or lake... ...and they celebrate when a typhoon gets this far north. It's a nice, quiet village. Take it easy there. Peace. Your room is on the second floor. - Show me. - I know it all.

I haven't talked much with him yet. I understand. I will do everything as that esteemed personage instructs me. If there are any developments, I'll let you know. Yes. I was going to feed him next. Yes. Well-done steak. Broccoli. Yes, understood.

I'll go wash mine then. - Oh! Do you have hot running water? - Of course. Do you have any fruit? - It's chilling in the fridge. - What is it? - A kiwi. - Give it to me now. - You're going to eat the dessert now? - Kiwi... - I suppose I will eat my fruit now as well. - Glad to hear it. Please, enjoy it. It is a prime cut of Kobe beef. It is delicious even though my cooking is sub-par. - Oh... - What is it? I've just got to... I'm sorry, I was not told that. I am being paid with red money, so don't worry about the bill... if you were worried. Do you really not drink, even with a meal? I don't. I don't know if you know much about track and field, but Yumena Souzoushi looks likely. That light over there. Isn't it a little wasteful to have it running? Please, feel free to ask me anything. I suppose you're still a little homesick... Please don't get discouraged and become unable to work. Let me have a drink. Even if you don't drink. May I? I'll behave myself and just have a taste. I won't go crazy wild or anything. After all, in this job, there's no room for someone who can't hold his drink. It was very good. - Would you like coffee? - What kind? Espresso. I'll go make one. Wrong number, asshole. Shall we begin the examination? - You're a doctor? - You got me. I used to be one... You look pretty thin, but you're actually quite wiry. - So you really do play some sport? - No. Do you like me? I'm sorry, but I'd just like a little conversation, you know? I was suddenly asked to take this job. Forget politics, just listen to me. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Did you just wake up? - No. - Don't lie. Your job is to tell the truth. - I just woke up. Why? What's wrong with you that you can't even wake up by yourself? I got so excited thinking about him on the second floor. I feel like he's watching me. Well, that's okay for the first day, but from now on you have to be with him all the time And it has to look natural. Do anything he asks you to, he won't ask for anything crazy. You won't be together long. Please, he will go home soon enough. Go home? - When did you wake up? - It was still dark outside. - That's amazing. - What is? If you ever feel ill at all, please tell me. I guess it will be pretty hot today. He easily took to the new faith of the North. And... He says he will start to preach it next month. Did you ask Tou? - He died in an accident. - Liar. It was an accident. There are many things you cannot rely on the ocean for. What? Feeling good? The weather is nice and cool. That's how it is in the North? Why isn't it so nice and cool in other places? You mean the South? The entire country... Why aren't they all nice and cool? The country is pretty long... For every hot front there's a cold front. That's why we are able to eat tuna, fugu, and herring. Oh, really? I wish we could stay here forever. Forever... Hey, baby, I'm a rich doctor! You need any surgery? How about an all night party, just the three of us? Oh, my God! - Hey, lemon bikini! What do you like to eat? - Perv! - Both of you are just my type. - Oh, no... It's okay if you're virgins, I'll teach you anything you want to know. Pink bikini! With the birthmark on your face! - How many you got in the swimsuit? - You're right. Oh, here it comes. What? What? - Oh, no! - You know it. I'm a doctor from Kabuki-cho. Don't worry. - Hey, what kind of doctor are you? - What? - What kind of doctor are you, I said? - What is she saying? - It's nice and cool. - Hey, man. - Do you speak English? - No, I can't speak English. Do you want to learn English this summer? Wait a minute! Wait for me. I don't care about English. Be my friend. Scary! - When you stop swimming, you die pretty quick... - You sure do. My swimming isn't as good as yours... Oh, I like it! My goodness! - See you later. - Hey, where you going? Moron! Hey, get out of there. Hey! Get the hell out of there! Hey! Where did you think you were going? You can't just go run into other people's cars... It's just not done. - You don't know anything. - I'll kill you. - What are you doing to him? - What, he had a friend? - He ran into my car! - Is this true? - Let's just go home... - Hey, hey, hey, what do you mean by go home? You can't just go home! You have to deal with the car! You ran into my car! Are you crazy? - Hey! - Yeah, he's crazy. - He's got to be crazy. - You bastard! Hey, if you're his caretaker, you'd better compensate us. How much do you want? 500,000 should cover it. There aren't many accidents that warrant a 500,000 payout. That's true. - You into cars, huh? - Enough not to give you 500,000. - Don't fuck with me! - Then, we have no choice but to resort to violence. I wouldn't fight me if I were you. I'd just kick your ass and piss in front of your prone body. Don't underestimate Kabuki-cho men. - Hm? How about it? - Let's forget about it. These dudes are nuts. Hey, stop it! - What do you want? - What'll you do? - What'll I do? - Exactly. - He ran into me! - It might be normal in America... It's okay. - But he ran into me! - So who cares? Say "It's okay"! Bastard! "It's okay"! "I'll forgive you". Got it? Okay. Be nice to her. Did he hurt you? Sorry to walk in on that sordid business. You're good. It's just not going my way today. I guess we all have days like that. Does it worry you? - When I drink, but not usua-- - It worries me... Are you worried about your reputation? Even though you didn't try to deal with the situation yourself? I knew today would be bad, I had a premonition this morning. That you'd run into some man's car? Don't talk about it... Yes, sir, yes, sir. What's that all about? Boss! Boss!

Hiromi (Mar 7 1959) - Did anything unusual happen? - No, not at all. Don't worry if he has some strange behaviors. I want him to feel like he can be himself. - Yes, sir. It's just... - Just what? If he runs away, do I have to chase him? I don't think he'll run away... Tomorrow a woman is coming. I'd like you to pick her up too. A woman, huh? - What woman? - A woman for you two... - Will she stay? - Until his job is done. - I don't think a woman is-- - You know what the job is. And I think you need a woman to finish it. Let him be himself, and treat the woman as a coworker. Is she pretty? Give her a room on the first floor near the stairs. - And don't forget to measure their blood pressure... - Um... - What? - When will the woman come? I'll call you again tomorrow.

Alone. Do you like women? - Depends on the woman. - Yeah, you have a point. Do you want to go fishing? Sure. - Have you fished before? - I used to go quite a lot. I never went before... - Not once? - No. - What would you like for dinner? - Let's eat out. Hey, if we catch anything, we'll eat that. A dead fish? That's kind of gross. What is it? Is it gross? So many things are gross... I'd like to know everything about you, from the time you were born... Stop it. Think of the hook like a needle, and poke it through the bait... Here... Don't just plop it here, cast it further and then reel it in a little. I guess fishing is kind of mysterious... We just see all this flat water but we think, "I bet they're over there", and cast our lines. Yeah... Let's go over there. - Here's bad? - Yeah. Here, here's one. I got one. Here. Yeah, yeah, you got it. Got it, got it. A carp. - Are you the one? - Uh... Wow, he's handsome. - He's my type. - Hey, keep it professional. We're all on the job. I'm sorry. He is an attractive man and I am reassured. Isn't it nice and cool? It certainly is. The other side. Wow, musk melon. I'm surprised it came before the rest of the meal. I like it. You see? It's on account of him that we eat fruit first. Is this his unusual personal style? - Um, neither of you are sick, right? - Sick? I mean, STDs? - That's gross. - I don't have any diseases. - I'm a doctor, you know. - A doctor? Oh, do you do abortions? Yeah, sure. - Is the hotel nearby? - Yeah, about an hour away. - Does the hotel have a bidet? - No. Do you have to talk about that at dinner? Stop. Okay. Biorhythm Kudou, Ookura, Kusunoki August 26 Kusunoki Hiromi Ookura Yousuke Kudou Naoya - So you two dudes were living here together? - Watch your words. Well, were you? Where is my room? - Hello. Are you the owner of this hotel? - Yes. - Can we talk to the manager? - I bought it last year, I am the manager. I've seen you before. I sure hope it wasn't in... a wanted poster! Can we see your ID? Just a second. - Here. - Thank you. Last name Kane (金) would normally be read Kim. - Oh, pleased to meet you, Mister... Kane? - Yes. How many guests do you have right now? Single couple, man and woman. Okay. - What are you here for? - Is the car nearby yours? That's right. What color is it? It's a white sedan. Wrong! Isn't it a white coupe? - White coupe? - Would you step outside, please? Step outside. It's that car over there. We ran the plates and it's stolen. We were wondering if you knew anything about it. - Is that the only problem? - What do you mean by that? - I mean, they only stole it? - You have a problem with that? And who stole it? - Is it your customers? Did they come in it? - No, I know who did it. Tell us, please. Well, I only suspect it. There's these two women. - I saw them driving it. - Did you see where they went? - I have to go tend my customers. - Okay. See you. It's me. What's wrong? - Are you alone? - I have to go talk to the police. - Why? - They're uptight about a stolen car. It's probably the fault of those young ladies earlier. - Be careful. - Leave it to me. I won't do anything to inconvenience you. They're paying me a lot of money to keep you happy. You are very interesting. Holding that knife, it really suits you. It's excellent. Just wait here quietly, please. Or play with the woman. I'll be back. - Come back soon. - Okay. I'm coming in. I'll leave you two alone. I've got to go talk to the cops. What are you doing? Come a little closer. Is this your weird hobby? What do you mean, my weird hobby? Well, will you cut me up with that knife and lick up the blood? - It's not like that, right? - Oh, it is. Quit joking around like that. You just like knives, right? Just the actual knives? It's pretty convenient. Would you cut off this apple peel for me? And would you bite through these walnuts with your powerful jaw? That's how you do it. Thanks. - What are you gonna do with that thing? - It was made in America. I'm going to poke it into someone's insides. - You'll kill an animal? - A human... - What an alarming conversation. - Am I scaring you? Well, it's pretty scary. - Have you ever wanted to kill someone? - Yeah, but I don't think I could actually do it. I have. Hey. Can you kill me? - Morning. - Slept well? I couldn't sleep... - Sounds OK to me. - It wasn't like that. - I mean, you did it, right? - What? - You know, that. - Not yet. - Not yet? - I tried... - You said he was handsome. - I tried! It was him that didn't want to. - Maybe you're not his type. - That's mean. - Maybe he was scared. - Of me? Yes. Maybe he's scared of getting it wrong in the dark. - That's an interesting thought. - Let me take your blood pressure. - What? - I can't touch you before he does! When is he coming back? Oh, real soon. - And don't say a damn thing. - Come on... If you're that scared, I'll inject us all with antibiotics. Can't you think of anything else to do? Blood pressure and injections? What kind of a man are you? I'm a doctor. - It's Sunday, right? - Yes... When you're in a place like this you do forget the days of the week. It's such good weather. I bet you guys have a blast. - We could go to the beach. - Let's have fun! - Is it okay to play that hard? - It's Sunday. I see. - Let him go. - But he's the one that suggested coming here... I have known him longer than you. - Tell me about yourself. - Hm? - I'm single. - Ever been married? I was, for 15 years. Broke up? It was pretty recent. I was waiting around, and then this job came up... You were a doctor? In Kabuki-cho. I guess this must be funner than being a doctor. - I wanted to be like Casey Kiruda. - Who's that? - You don't know it? - No. He was also a normal doctor. He was adopted into a more prestigious family. It's not that cool a story. It was like a detective novel, he was actually the illegitimate son. He was surrounded by hardship... And one day he got a call from someone he didn't know... And they said, "I'll give you as much money as you want." I see. - So what's your story? - I don't know. I'm just a party companion. You know, an escort. My agency told me to come here and that I'd get some money. - Would you swim with me? - Is it OK? - Yes, we're playing. - Okay, let's go swim. Oh, I got it. Well, you go ahead, and give me a minute. What are you whispering, creepy? I'll be back in a minute. - You won't swim with us? - I can't right now. Hey, man, sorry to ask you, but do you know where I can get a girl? O-tae! O-tae! O-tae! A customer. I'll come down in a second. - I want your best girl, even if it costs me... - Yes, sir. I'll send her at once. Someone important is coming, so we're all on edge... Important? That guy with the new religion. The one that's in the papers all the time. - Mr. Tanigawa? - Yes, Tanigawa. When is he coming? - This Saturday. - This Saturday? For what? He wanted to make an old folks home in the name of the religion... And he was going to ask the people around. The children are going to perform in a brass band for him. And I'm going to go too. - Is this a joke? - It's real. You don't follow him? I couldn't join such a religion. I'll let you go, but you shouldn't badmouth the new religion in this town. Do you follow Tanigawa's new religion too? Is there something wrong with that? - He's coming here, right? - Yes, soon. Is it OK to do something like this when he's coming soon? No...but I can't live without it... Without what? You can't live without the heart - Do you think he can drive? - Hell no. You have a look on your face like you can't drive either. How troublesome. - Are you okay? - How do you know about it? - As long as no harm comes to him, it's okay. - I understand. I can't believe those small fry really got you. - Are they an enemy we will have to deal with? - No, don't worry, I had them eliminated. - When can you drive again? - Perhaps 2 days from now. Okay. There will be a piece of mail for him. Very important. Take it where he says. And take his blood pressure again. It will all be over soon... Understood. Come on... You're deep... Fill me up... Damn, I'm gonna come soon. The flower is blooming, eh? Hey. I'm close too. - Here we go... - Why? I'm not allowed to come before him. Nobody will know unless you tell them...come on... It feels really good for a man... So let's come together! Hotel -> Station Driving: Ookura Passengers: Kudou, Kusunoki Distance: Approximate time: I've got to go. I'll be back soon.

Thank you. - Will you be at the rally on Saturday? - Of course! I wouldn't miss seeing the boss for anything. How many people live in this house? I'm terribly sorry...there's just the 5 of us, so I can only bring 5 to the rally... Good to hear. Speaking of which... - Here, have some flags and posters. - Oh, thank you very much. You didn't have to. I'm home. Hm? Where is he? Why is it that you can't do anything, but you have all of these? What do you plan to do with them? Stop! You! What are you doing! What happened? My deepest apologies. Don't go there. I'm going to apologize. Yes? I'm sorry for that just now... Make sure that he is in the hotel before 4:30 PM tomorrow. Other than that, do whatever he likes. He knows the time is near. He might become extremely neurotic now. If he wants, give him some drugs. Now, about the woman... Yes? Is he sleeping with her? - I think so... - Are you sure? Well, I haven't personally seen them doing it... - Did you sleep with her? - No... I see. Then please go back to driving duty. Understood.

So two rooms? - And can you get a girl for the single guy? - Yes, sir. - A really good girl. - Leave it to me, sir. - Hey, are you real tired? - I sure am tired. The job's gonna end soon. Yeah, it is. I wonder if he's fucking the girl. Good evening. - Is it nice and cool? - No... - Listen to that, he must be fucking her like hell. - Didn't know he had it in him. - But he isn't making any noise? - Well, he is the quiet type. - I guess... - Yeah. Hello? Oh, yes, he is resting in the room next door. I said, he is resting in the room next door. Come over here, come here. Police Officers Members of the Religion Watarishima station: No errors in security Kudou, let's stop kidding around here. - What do you mean? - I mean, do you really think you can pull it off? Forget about it. Let's run away together. We'll run and run and be on the run forever. Doesn't that sound fun? Let's all run away to the South together... Kudou, even if you don't do it, they'll get someone else! Who other than me will do it, idiot? T Excuse me. - Oh, hello again. - Here. We have this. Oh, go right along. Thanks for taking care of me.
