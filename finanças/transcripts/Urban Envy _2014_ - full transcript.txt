[Electric sound effects] [Glass breaking] [Birds chirping] [Music] [Church organ playing] Let the church say Amen let the church say Amen. Oh somebody better give God some praise in his house. Hallelujah! We serve a mighty God. God that woke us up this morning and started us on our way Amen. clothed in our right minds. I mean get into this text cause I mean I'm a little bit excited. I don't know about you but God is so good Amen? The text is gonna come from Matthew Chapter 26. We're gonna start at the sixth verse. And it reads like this. Now when Jesus was in Bethany, and the House of Simon the leper there came onto him, a woman, having a bottle of precious ointments. Son can't you just feel the spirit all in this place? Yeah, it's ok ma. But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation saying, to what matter... is... this... waste. Now when I read this text i... I got a little bit... annoyed... with the disciples. See here. See the deciples... A yo pops you alright? Yeah... [Coughing] I'm alright boy. Sometimes we can get caught up in worrying about the Joneses. All right now. So! Come on ya'll, go with me now. Now If i step on your feet just move them back. Yeah I'm okay with that now. Now sometimes we can get caught up, in the wrong spirit. We can get caught up in the spirit of jealousy... and and. And we can get caught up in the spirit of pride. And... And we can get caught up... in the spirit... of... envy. See the spirit of envy is wanting something... that belongs to somebody else. See... See,,, How Long?!! Are we gone worry about... what someone else has going on? How long?!! Are we gone worry about, someone else hopes, their desires, and their goals? See how long?!! Are we gone be all up in somebody else's business? I'm here to let you know.... Hey there go Peaches! Where you goin? Mom i need to talked to Peaches.

[Crying] Nooooo!! I know you don't like talking about this cancer thing. But it's real. If you don't tell me anything. How am I supposed to help you? [Sad instrumental music] Daddy I can't do it! Marcus could do anything you put your mind to. ["Carla Cook" Not gonna let you] *They'll be times Church... We're gathered here to celebrate the life. And the legacy. Of Deacon Brian Allen Williams. A man who served this church. Metropolitan Community Tabernacle for over twenty two years. So how are you holding up Deb? What are you doing here? I just wanted to be here for you and Marcus. Is that such a bad thing. Then you shall call first. I know I know I should have called you Ded but you see I just want. Will this is my husband's funeral. But he was my best friend. [Footsteps] Marcus... Marcus... Peaches. I'm so glad you could make it. It's good to see you. How you holding up? Best I can I guess. Your mom seems to be doing well. [Deep sigh] Mom's... She's faking Peaches. On the inside she's crying screaming. Wonder what she'll do without her best friend of 36 years. Wow. Thirty-six years? Well if she's faking she's doing a heck of a job. Peaches I don't meaning to talk to you. [Deep sigh] I miss you. Look I don't know what this Harvey thing was about and I really don't care. I need you in my life. I still love you. I've missed you too. And the whole Harvey thing's been over for months. I heard about his cousin trying to shoot you and he swore he didn't have and nothing to do with it. I didn't belive him. Besides... He's already got a new dance partner and he's claiming victory for the dance competition. Especially since you're not competing. Peaches he can have it. I don't care. Look ever since I won this competition I've been losing everything that I really care about and I'm not gonna let this dance world take anymore for me. Sometimes things don't go the way we plan. But there's always a lesson in them and it seems you've learned your lesson. Good for you. Peaches, peaches you're what's good for me. Hell I've always known that. Every sense i've looked into your eyes. [Deep sigh] Is that Will? You just don't understand. No I don't! It's probably nothing. Look I still gotta look into it. just wait and I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I just... Is there a problem? No son and there's no problem. He was just leaving. If you would just let me explain. No. Look... Maybe later Maybe some other time. I'm feeling a little tired right now because of all this and I think I just need to go home and lay down for a while. Well Will, I think it's time you leave, man. Wow. You look really good son. I just want to say to you - Look, first of all. I'm not your son. And second my mother has already asked you to leave! Now for the last time, Cat Daddy! Pimp your way on up out the door. You know. You're right. You're right. Forgive me. I'm sorry. Maybe you and I can continue this conversation at another time. I've got to leave for Italy next week so, y'all take care.

Huh, "a shock." But, son... There were some things that happened back then that I just I just couldn't explain to you. Ma, couldn't tell me or wouldn't tell me? Chose not to tell me? You know this is some bullshit! [slap] Don't you ever talk to me like that. I'm still your mother! I'm sorry, Ma. [Deep sigh] But, with all due respect... I don't know that man as my father.

Brian and I had fallen in love and when Will saw how happy the three of us were together, he decided to just let us live our lives. I followed every part of your life. I was at every sporting event. Every dance competition. Every graduation. And not only just that. Every major event you've been in. Sense age 12. I just didn't want to be noticeable. Until last year... When you won that ballroom competition. I was so proud of you. The title! Back in the family. Yes! Family? Family?! Hell I was taught that a family prays together. A family! Eats together. Hell a family looks out for one another. My father... My real father Brian! he taught me that. Yeah he taught you right. And he did a great job in raising a family. Look. I'm not here to replace your father. All I'm asking... is whether or not we could be friends. I don't have many of those either. Son just be open to it. Why Ma?! So he could feel better about leaving us? I never felt good about leaving you guys. And I'll never let that happen! And it won't! It won't. Son why are you so angry? Ma do you really have to ask me that question? really?! Look if you're gonna blame somebody blame me. You don't get it do you? Ma you're not the one who left us. He did. And he came back son. And he never left again. Stop giving him credit for coming back! Hell he ain't done nothin for us but come back. That's not true son. He's done plenty. Ma what do you mean, Done plenty? Your first car. School pictures. School clothes. Senior trips. Will made sure all of that happened and some. I've always been there for you son. Just from afar. And you know what? That was the hardest thing in the world for me to do. But you see... Something's... just not in your control. All I'm asking is Is if you and I.. can be friends. Damn. All this time. [Music] Love you son. Always have. I can't make you no promises. But I am in need of a dance coach. I got called out on national television about an hour ago. Yeah... Isaw that. Welp!
