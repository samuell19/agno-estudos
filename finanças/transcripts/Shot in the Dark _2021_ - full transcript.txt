I mean like pink crib or blue crib. No, stop it! Yellow is fine. That's very neutral. Girls can like blue. I love blue. I mean, I was thinking maybe we go slower. You know, I just can't believe that she agreed. Wow. Yeah, supposedly tonight. No, I'm serious. - Carter? - Yeah. Yeah, so that was two days ago. He's missing. He didn't come home. Can you hold on one second? I'm gonna have to call you back. Yeah, so it's about my son. Ah, where'd you come from? It has been confirmed that another box has just arrived at the Wallow County Sheriff's Station. Kathleen had that only when I was older. [Clay Oh, shoot! - [Sam Right? - Okay, yeah. Yeah, you lost me. What's that? Yeah. What's that song about her fucking that chumongo dick? I'll be right back with your fries. Thank you, ma'am. All right, thank you. "Like a Virgin." Yeah, that's the one. God, that thing in the square today was fucking nuts. Ferrell, 27 at the time of his disappearance was a construction worker in Wallow County and described by many as quiet and kind. I think I met him. Really? Yeah, he was like, really sweet to me. He's leaving clues. What? With three of the five victims... He wants to be caught. I don't know what the psychology is behind everything, but a lot of serial killers do this. They want to be caught. Okay, can we just address this really quickly? Who here thinks the killer is a man? Other county officials are now involved. Everyone. Everyone. He's a guy. It's a guy. Joshua Ferrell, 65 days ago. It's a guy. Give me one piece of evidence why it couldn't be a woman. Yeah, she's right. There's no reason it couldn't be a woman. Thank you, Cheryl. I heard that the only thing they found left of Ferrell was two of his fingers in a box. I mean, how fucked up do you have to be to cut people up, put 'em in a box, and show it to their families? Breaking news. Authorities have just released footage of the suspect they are looking to question in connection with the murders. Now there isn't much to go off of, but he's definitely Caucasian, male, brunette, between 5'10 " and 6'1", 150 to 170 pounds. Notice the prominent red hat. You want some fries? He doesn't need to eat all those. It's been two years, man. See you later, man. Come on, man. What? I mean, what are we supposed to, walk on eggshells for a decade? - You could have been more sensitive about it. We've been really sensitive about it. I don't even get why you guys still hang out with him. Nope. Sam, just. - Okay. All right. Should I apologize? Would that make everybody feel better? Clay, isn't that your? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Oh shit! Hey! - You son of a bitch! - Clay, Clay! Can you handle this alone? The job? No. Then I'll have to flip you for it. Flip me for it? Flip me for what? Who stays. So if I win, I can leave. Sure, exactly. You got a coin? Should have. This is it, okay? I'm done. Drop the charges. - No! - Drop the charges. Why? It's your choice! Good! He won't be released unless you drop charges. Fucking good! He fucking made his bed, now he can fucking shit in it. That's not my fucking friend in there. He's gonna pay for the damages. It's not about the fucking damages. He's our friend. He's not our friend. He is. He's not. The guy in there hasn't been our friend in a really long, fucking time. He's gonna pay for the car. It's not about the fucking car. It's not about the- oh, god. What do you wanna do? You wanna drop the charges? Aside from being white, male, no other connection has been established. Authorities ask that you be vigilant when you're in your home, maintain an awareness of your surroundings, change up your routine, and please call the police if you notice anything out of ordinary. William. William. There's a party at Arty's tonight. You're welcome to come. I mean, seriously, it's been two months and it's nada. You'd think the police would have something by now. I mean, some sort of clue, a fingerprint, or something. Oh, they do have something? Okay, I can't really see anything. Wait a minute, that's it? Sorry, folks. Well, apparently, I've just been informed they do have footage of a guy with a low brimmed, red hat purchasing supplies at a hardware store. Have you folks seen this? A guy entered a local hardware store in Douglas and purchased some questionable items like plastic sheeting, boxes. Things everyone buys, I guess? All right, well that's Still pretty much nothing if you ask me. You know, he purchased it with cash, so I guess what they're telling us is that we should be on the lookout for a guy with a red hat. I'm about to get outta here for the night. Need anything? - Hmm? Do you need anything? Come here and look at this. Oh, hell. What? Call the Mrs, tell her you gonna miss dinner. Where's my ring? Your ring? - Yeah. - Where is the last? It's okay, it's all right. We'll find it, okay? It's all right. Where do you remember it last? William? I wanted to make this for you as a way of saying I'm sorry. Don't judge. Why do you come here? What? Why do you come here? You. What? You know why. No, I don't. Why do you come here? I thought you'd want me to. Good night, Sheryl. Well, I'm a nerd. Okay, I'm gonna go. Bye. Help me. Help me. Please, please. Help me. Help me. Hey. Where you've been? You all right? Help me. Help me, please. Help, help. Help me. Hey. Hi, babe. How's it going? Want a drink? - I have one. Oh, coming prepared. I'm gonna steal some of that later. I hope you know that. Help me. Help me. Help! Help! The only thing they found left of Ferrell was two of his fingers in a box. You read the tables, right? I mean, you're right. You know. Will! Yes! - You look good, man. - Okay. - Come on in! - Come in here! What's up? What? How are you doing, man? I'm good. How are you? It's good seeing you again. Hey, it's so great seeing you. How are you? - Good seeing you too. Is this? - Yeah. All right, cool. Thought we'd- So, how long do we have you for? Oh, two weeks. - Okay. - Yeah, I gotta, I have a book signing I have to get back for. - Ooh! - Book signing. - Yes! - Big old. Congrats on that by the way. But, why you been shaking your head? I don't know. It's 'cause you're a yuppie now. Oh, I know. Pretty yuppie though. Pretty. - A pretty yuppie. I like this sweater. Thank you. - It's great. - The sweater? It was a joke. Hey, guys. What's up? Can I get you guys drinks to start? What do you want, man? Whiskey, neat. I'm gonna do water. No, no. He's having whiskey. I'm having whiskey. You're having whiskey. Do you have one of those curly straws, that look cool when you're drinking? Why would you? Sorry, what's your name? Lily. - Lily? - Yes. Oh, like the flower. - Like the restaurant? - Yeah, right back there. See that right there? Oh. This is? - That's the name of the restaurant. Ah, small town! You know where people actually like own and work. I don't know. I haven't been in one in a while. I know, I know. I'm mean, that's why I'm explaining it to you. Well, you have a lovely, lovely establishment here. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Okay, so you guys good? We're good. Are you good? I'll be right back. People! Oh my god, didn't they teach you how to pick up a girl in New York? No, no, I'm a writer. We don't, we sit in closets. That's not true. You need to skip to the part where you tell her you're rich. - I like that. - You can finish mine too. This was a huge salad. It was big, okay? Your salad? Yes! It was big, okay? It's real big, yeah. I wonder where he's going. Let women be women. Let them feel stuff. Name of Daisy, name of Violet, Rose sucks. Don't name 'em Rose. Women, women already have all the power. Why try to make them something they're not? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Yeah, man. Yeah, you know what I'm saying. Finish. Oh, you? I do. Yeah? Obviously you don't. I've only known you for a minute. Yeah. What do you wanna know? And that cleared the wind from the room. Strange, there's a usable print. Some coffee for you, Bill. What'd you say? I said there's a usable print here. That's Carter's? His on the box. This one's on the ring. Off a ring? Give me your wedding band. Come on. Don't you drop it, lose it, or anything. I'm not gonna lose it. May I have my ring back? Thank you. You're welcome. Longing for that in some way. I really liked your book. - How long you been painting? Thank you. I liked a lot actually. The water really matches your eyes. I wish I was clever, more clever with my words right now. It's kinda made me speechless. Your skill set has been disabled. Yeah. That's good. It's just nice that she even agreed to go on a date with me. That's what happens when you get a little bit famous. No, that's not why she did it. She's different, man. She's, she gets it, you know? She's... This is just a fling, man. You've known her for how long, two weeks now? You're gonna go back to New York. You just did this big book tour, so more people are gonna know your name. They're gonna be girls all over the place. You're gonna be fine. It'll be okay. You're okay. When you go back? Two weeks. Man. Fuck. Well, ah, I got you something to remember us little people by. To Johnny from June. I really mean it, man. I'm really proud of you. You're doing a good job. Did you think of that yourself, to Johnny from June? It's only they had at the pawn shop. Oh, I appreciate it. Thank you. - I'll cherish this. - You're welcome. Lovely sentiment. It's extra sentimental now. Probably meant twice as much to whoever actually made it. Stop talking. I'm hitting the ball. Okay, my bad. Thank you. Oh, did you hear that? Yeah. You bringing her to the costume party? Help me. Help me. What, what did I do to you? What? Help. Help me. Help, help! What the fuck are you wearing? You said it was a costume party. You believed me? It's a cool costume. - It's a good costume. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I thought it was a costume party. No. No, you did not. I'm sorry. Help me! I'm the only one in costume! "Saturday Night Fever" though, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Why? I thought it was a costume party. I'm just fucking with you. It's cool, and pink. Anyway, if you guys don't know anyone, what brought you here? Well, I know this guy. I know Fence too. Don't know him. No? Okay. Lily. Lily told us about the party. - Lily? - Yeah. Wait, Lily Thompson? You know her? Yeah! Oh yeah, we went out once. How do you guys know her? Oh, incoming. Hot! - Hi. - Hi. Well, look at you, pretty in pink. I'm gonna die. That's how I felt walking into that hotel alone, wearing that pink suit that everyone made fun of me for, and for all I knew she was out on a date with another guy. The guy who keeps leaving her flowers. And once I get to the room and there's this envelope there, and inside there's a tape. She made me a tape. She, apologizing. Apparently we just missed each other. She was trying to end things with the guy, and I don't know if end things is the right word though. They were never really together. Waiting, dealing with. At the end of this tape there's this song that she made. And um, I don't know. I'm think I'm interested in seeing where this goes. Stop. I don't need what you need, okay? My life is fine where it is. I like it! I like my life here. And you... - All right. - I'm not gonna like it. I'm crazy about you. Don't bring fucking feelings into this. It's not about feelings. Okay, I love you. Okay, stop it. What? Don't say shit like that. It's- Fuck it. I know it's small, but I got a lot of ideas. It's not small. A lot of ideas for additions. It's a nice house. I wanna see this house. Oops, sorry. Wait. Yeah? I thought we, I thought we talked about putting the paintings up later. I know. I just wanna see how it looks right here. You don't like it? No, I like it. I'm just saying we can, you know, I think we could decide together where all the paintings go. Okay. Oh, shit! Oh, god. Dude, no joke. Vince, she okay? No, she's fine. What do you want to know? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck! Get off of him! No, it's not! I'm not fucking- Can I have a paint room? I can't hang my painting where I want to 'cause I have a paint room. Everything goes in that one room. I wanted to put it there. You put the stupid, fucking tree there. You could- What does that say to me? Nothing I do is important to you? You want the fucking painting there, we'll put the fucking painting there. Yes, I want it there! Okay, we'll put the fucking painting there! I wanted it there in the first place and you said no! No, I didn't say no! There. There's your new writing room. I'm still mad at you. It's the big day. Today is the big day. Somebody's getting in the correct mindset. Speakers bumping at the party! When you get to the hotel later, good luck. Are you getting them? I'm getting them. It's good. Look at you guys! Okay, ready? Okay, okay, ready? Who's lighting? Who's lighting? Okay, you get 'em. - Ready? - Go, go! Oh, oh! Oh my god! Fuck you! Fuck you! Okay? Fuck you! Fucking say something! Say something that fucking means anything! Give me something! Give me something! I wanted to put it on the fucking wall. That's not all you said. William! What's up, what's up? William? Try not to look too broken up about it. William? Hello? You ready to swing now? Are you paying attention? - Give it your all. - Great. Did you ever sit at Moon and Kivett? You know, where it straight just takes you outta town and if you go right or left, just swing back around into town. Did you ever sit there and decide to go? No. You free this weekend? Yeah. Cool. I'm thinking of packing up some of Lily's paintings and sending 'em to Matt in New York and see if he can showcase 'em. Who's Matt? My literary agent. Fuck! Hey. Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Oh. Yeah? - Yes! It is! Don't be mad. I don't think you'll be mad anyways, but- Okay? I, I took some samples of your work. I sent them to Matt and he showed it to some people, and they're interested in doing a gallery to showcase your work. Hey Will, do you feel like someone has been in the house? She finally ends things with that guy, and the guy keeps leaving her flowers. William, do you need a break? In her last moments she was attempting to reach the phone. Today we learned from the coroner that there were multiple contusions in the abdominal region suggesting that she was beaten in the stomach causing internal bleeding killing both her and the baby. I know this is hard. Is there anything you see in these photos that might help us? You see something? No. Hey Will, do you feel like someone has been in the house? Quit. Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck you, you fuck! Fuck you! Fuck! The fuck is this? Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck! No, fuck you! No, fuck! Aside from being white, male, no other connection has been established. Okay. Okay. Stop. Okay, okay. Okay, stop, stop, stop! You don't have to do this. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do this. Please, don't. Don't, don't! Don't do this. Hey, please. Don't, don't. I just wanted to say that I had this weird drama to deal with with an old, guy friend. It's something that I've been kinda avoiding dealing with, but it's handled now. It just took longer than I expected. And I wanted to make this for you as a way of saying I'm sorry. Don't judge me. Oh! William. Yeah? I was thinking maybe we postpone it? The gallery? You wanna postpone the gallery? Yeah, I just, it's a long way to travel and I just don't know if it's safe for me to go right now, and, yeah. I want you to be happy. You got to start thinking about the baby now. I am thinking about the baby. Bill? Bill. Laugh ton Police Department. All right, we should definitely refill our cups. Would you like some more? Yeah, why don't we? Hold on one second. What? Check my phone. I got a phone actually. Yeah, from my work. I just got it. It's a cell phone! Yeah. Hello? Yes, sir. I gotta go. Call me. Thanks for the number. All right! We fucking grew up like everyone does. What do you mean, grew up? And we, we... we're different now. When did that happen? I don't know when it happened. There wasn't like a moment that it happened. It just, it just happened. Okay? Like, over time. I just, how do you not see that? I feel like, that we're just not the same people, and I just, I don't think we could- - What do you mean? Do this anymore. This is it. This is our life. Fuck. I'm getting another drink. Help! Help me, please! Help me, please! Help! Please, help! Please, help me. It's Sheriff. Holy shit. You're gonna be okay. Okay, we're here to help. Okay. You're okay now. You're gonna be okay, all right? All right. All right, all right. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Today is a good day for the people and city of Laugh ton. Mayor Drake stated in a special press conference as the suspected killer, known to the public as the Mailman Killer, was found dead in his home earlier this morning. Police were first tipped off when forensics discovered a fingerprint on a wedding band that led authorities directly to him. That print was an exact match from one William E Langston. Langston, once an up and coming young author, became reclusive and violent following his wife Lily's death two years ago, racking up multiple arrests, including battery. And what was it like when you saw his body? I was researching leads at the time when I got the call on my cell phone. They told me actually not to come in, but I knew him. I knew the guy, and he was brought into the office on several occasions, incarcerated on several occasions. He seemed what you would think of as nerd, nerdy, or a geek, but he was dangerous. Here, let me help you. Oh. Thanks. - Yeah, have a good day.
