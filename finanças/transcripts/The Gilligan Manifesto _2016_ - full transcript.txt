- [Oppenheimer] Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds. (dramatic orchestra music) - [Announcer] Finally after three years work, the atomic experts were ready to test their first bomb. In the control shack was Dr. J.R. Oppenheimer. - The automatic control's got it now. Rob, this time the stakes are really high. - It's going to work all right, Robert, and I'm sure we'll never be sorry for it. - [Broascaster] Put on your goggles. Observers without goggles must face away from the blast. - [Countdown Woman] 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Zero. - [Man] Whoopee!

From that moment on, humankind became a threat to the world we inhabit. - I had been asked whether in the years to come it will be possible to kill 40 million American people in the 20 largest American towns by the use of atomic bombs in a single night. I'm afraid that the answer to that question is yes. - [Narrator] After World War II ended, the Soviet Union refused to terminate their occupation of Eastern Europe. This was followed in 1949 by the detonation of their first nuclear weapon. Anxiety over the possibility of nuclear war and the spread of Soviet-style dictatorships grew with each passing year.

At the United Nations, Soviet representative Andrey Vyschinsky refused to comment and stomped coldly into the assembly building. The grim vision of an atomic war which would leave complete desolation in its wake is a problem that deeply affects nearly all deliberations of the international forum. A system of worldwide atomic control for peace must still be resolved. Will man destroy himself or use his power to make existence a paradise? 1950 may tell the tale! - [Narrator] Barely a year after the Cuban Missile Crisis, production on a pilot for a new television show began that depicted a small group of Americans having to rebuild civilization in a virtual post-apocalyptic world. From these ashes, they had to construct a new society. Remarkably, during the height to tension with the Soviets, the new social order they created was founded on Marxist Communism.

There is a skipper where there is no boat, a professor where there is no school, a millionaire couple where there is no money, and a movie star where there are no movies and where the concept of celebrity has no meaning. Only Gilligan and Mary Ann, who are members of the working class, are identified by name. - Most people think of it as just a bunch of different characters getting together, but there's a deep philosophy. - There's no dating it. There's no cars, there's no clothes, there's no anything to tell you what time in history it took place. - I was looking for a funny way to say something very serious and I got the idea to bring a lot of different kinds of people together who would not normally be together. - We weren't all in a house. We were outside and coexisting and depending on each other, which was sort of a microcosm of the world. - It was about people finding a, you know, people had to get along, they had to work together, had to help each other. In essence, that's what they had to do. In essence, that's what we did. - Every civilization can identify and every generation can identify. - It's easier to demonstrate things dramatically, but sometimes those lessons are hammered into you, whereas doing it gently with comedy you achieve the same purpose and sometimes its longer lasting. - I guess the microcosm of this civilization, I don't think we had any concept while we were doing it that that's what we were doing. I don't think we had any concept at all that it was gonna sustain this long. I think the naivete of it all is what's made it sustainable. I don't think we were wise in trying to get the message across. - [Narrator] Gilligan's island played on the subconscious fear of nuclear annihilation and the prospect of having to rebuild society from scratch in the event of survival. - I was going to do a two hour show in which there was a movie where everybody was dead... After some apocalyptic result of nuclear war. And I was gonna do a satiric episode, two hour show, where that was headlines around the world, but the group was in a cave and the cave, for some reason, was a lot of lead around this cave, and when they came out after the cave and they heard about this on the radio that there was the tragic happening, they were not aware that because of the lead they were saved and they might be the only seven people left in the world. - [Narrator] Ever since the detonation of the first atomic bomb, this theme has been pervasive in literature and cinema. - [Man] Run for your life! Run, run, run! (people screaming) - [Announcer] On an island of tropical splendor these three must make their own world, their own new code of morals. From their secret base on an uncharted island somewhere in the Pacific. (dramatic orchestra music) - What's this all about? What's everybody running from? - It's the end of everything! - I'm not arguing theory, General. I'm here to ask you, to beg you, to save your own world. - [Announcer] Atomic hydrogen weapons capable of wiping cities, countries off the face of the Earth. - [Announcer] Yes cities, nations, even civilization itself. Threatened with annihilation because in one moment of history making violence, nature, mad, rampant, wrought its most awesome creation. - [Announcer] Mankind totters on the brink of its own head-long rush to cataclysmic destruction. What is it, this terror that destroys cities? You won't want to look, but you can't help it. You won't believe your eyes, but you'll never forget what they see. You won't wanna stay, but you'll be glued to your seat. - [Announcer] More thrilling, more exciting, more mystifying is the monster, the mutation by atomic energy, part man, part beast. Salaciously watching women as they bathe. - [Announcer] Yes, the most shocking experience of their lives. Doubly shocking because it can happen to you. - [Announcer] Nine minutes before countdown. Nine minutes while the world waits and wonders. Share if you dare the unbearable suspense of men and women who have never in their lives faced greater peril. - [Announcer] Electrifying terror as the Earth dies screaming. (screams) - There it is now. Attacking the United Nations building. (dramatic orchestra music) - [Announcer] These are the people caught in the most explosive threat ever to face the world. - [Announcer] In just a few moments these five, American newspaper man, English bathing beauty, German scientist, Russian soldier, Chinese peasant girl, will be given the power to destroy every human being on Earth. What will they do? What will their governments force them to do? What would you do? Every human being alive will die. - [Announcer] He saw them capture innocent people only to destroy. (screams) - [Announcer] Father turned against son. - [Announcer] The perfect man, created by man, becomes man's worst enemy. - Proceed! (screams) - [Announcer] They knew that only a missile with an atomic warhead could crack the Earth's impenetrable inner core. Would it mean the end of the world? - [Announcer] An island disappears when the brutal power of nature's inner force is released. - They've shifted the tilt of the Earth. The stupid, crazy, irresponsible bunglers. They've finally done it. - What if the crack keeps going right around the world? What happens then? - Where the land mass is split, the oceans will be sucked in. And the colossal pressure generated by the steam will rip the Earth apart and destroy it. - It isn't possible. It's insane. - [Dispatcher] All units! All units take shelter! Take shelter, missiles coming in! Missiles three minutes away! (dramatic orchestra music) - There they are! (siren blaring) (dramatic orchestra music) - [Announcer] One scientist foresaw the day the world ended. - There are two forms of life fighting for survival out here in this valley. And only one of them can win. - I'll talk to the girls in the morning. - The girls? - Yes. They should bear children as soon as possible. - Countdown must have started by now. - Drink up then. Here's how. - [Broadcaster] 22. 21. - To the luck of the human race. - [Broadcaster] Four. Three. Two. One. (laughter) - Do you wanna know what time it is? - Gilligan, that's not important. - It's eight to zero. - Eight what? - I don't know. Here, see? (upbeat orchestra music) - [Narrator] Over the years there had been many attempts to analyze Gilligan's Island. One popular theory asserts that the castaways represent the seven cardinal sins, but there are serious problems with this argument. Once you get past lust and greed as personified by Ginger and Mr. Howell, the remaining correlations are arbitrary. The Skipper's the only character who displays anger, but he is also the only one who vaguely personifies gluttony. The remaining sins of envy, pride, and sloth are ascribed so tenuously that similar analogies could be made for any other group of seven items. For instance, the characters could be said to represent The Seven Dwarfs. The Skipper is Grumpy, the Professor is Doc, and Gilligan is Dopey. Or they could be said to symbolize the seven wonders of the ancient world where Mrs. Howell is the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Mary Ann is the Temple of Artemis, and the Professor is the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Or one could claim they embody the seven kinds of fruit used in Hawaiian Punch, where the Professor is apple, Ginger is passion fruit, and the Howells naturally are Guava and Apricot. Even if a correlation seemed acrid for all of the characters, there's the question of moral consequence. What kind of theology punishes sinners by forcing them to stay on an island paradise? The biggest problem, however, is that in order for this claim to make any sense, the castaways would have to be trapped on the island due to their sinful nature. This is precisely what we do not see. Opportunities for rescue are most often missed because visitors to the island are unable or unwilling to help. Not because Ginger is lustful, or Mr. Howell is greedy. Not only does this hypothesis fail in its broad observation, it provides no insight. (dramatic orchestra music) Of all the questions asked about the show, the central one that is most overlooked is why is the show called Gilligan's Island? - They say the meek shall inherit the Earth. That's in the bible someplace. And that was my belief, that in a world that was rearranged, which Gilligan's Island was, that the least likely person would be the most likely to be critically important to the show. And Gilligan was critically important 'cause he kept ruining every escape. - [Narrator] Arguments could easily be made for the prominence of any of the characters, but Gilligan is the embodiment of the working class. By calling the show Gilligan's Island, the focus is always on the proletariat as the series lampoons capitalist exploitation. (upbeat orchestra music) President Harry S. Truman initiated the largest peace time military spending that the United States had ever seen and pushed for the creation of the hydrogen bomb. - [Announcer] From Washington, General of the Armies Eisenhower sets out on a mission unprecedented in history. To organize and command an international army to defend Western Europe against communist aggression. - Mr. President, I devoutly pray that the mission on which I'm leaving this morning will result in nothing but peace, security, and tranquility for our various nations. - Gentlemen, I am Thurston Howell III and this of course is my wife Mrs. Thurston Howell III. - Charmed. - Capitalist, exploiter. - Capitalist, exploiter, I was wrong lovey, they're very friendly. (laughter) Little does she care how hard other people work to make me money. Spend, spend, spend, I tell you it's creeping socialism. - [Eunice] And everybody wants something from you right? - Right, and what do I do about it? - You use it, the way any self-respecting multi-millionaire does, you use it. Power, my boy! You are a king! - Mr. Howell, you just moved your king to a new place. - Wait a minute! Young man, are you accusing a Howell of cheating? I'll have you know I'm far too wealthy. - To cheat? - No, to be accused. - But the Professor's wasting his time on a tycoon. - No dear, it's a typhoon, you see a tycoon, that's a man with money, like myself. A typhoon is a big bag of wind. - Thurston-- - Never mind what you're thinking, no comment. (laughter) - Besides being a houseboy, I'm a butler and chauffeur. - Chauffeur? - That part's easy, we don't have a car. (laughter) - Gilligan, I think they're overworking you around this place, I mean you must feel like a prisoner around here taking all these jobs. - Oh no Skipper, I get every other Thursday off. (laughter) (dramatic orchestra music) - [Announcer] Dominating one half of the world, Communism stands solidly opposed to the western concept of democracy. With over 750 million people under communist rule, nearly one-third of the population of the Earth, Soviet Russia holds a commanding position in the future destiny of the world. Since World War II, Communism by force and by propaganda has extended its frontiers into the heart of Europe. Russia's newest and possibly most important gains have been in the Orient, where half a billion Chinese have been herded into the communist camp. - [Announcer] Russia had launched one of history's most drastic, political, moral, and economic wars, a Cold War. The United States was obliged to help Europe safeguard its traditional freedoms and the independence of its nations. Gone was the spirit of wartime unity that reached its peak on that historic afternoon in April '45 at the Elbe River in Germany. Here two worlds actually met, but this coalition was to be torn asunder. (explosions) - [Narrator] Democracy is presented as a tool that protects the interests of the elite. - There's no sense arguing about who stands in front of the camera. We'll do it the democratic way, according to who's who. - All right Professor, we'll do this the democratic way. - I'll buy that. - Yes Gilligan, now all those in favor of Gilligan telling Mary Ann raise your right hand. (laughter) There you are Gilligan, two to one. On your way, little buddy. - If that's the democratic way, I'm gonna turn into a republican! - [Narrator] Using satire, the series exposes how each of the three branches of democratic governance manufactures social unrest and abuse of power. (upbeat orchestra music) When the castaways realize there's no leader on the island, a crisis ensues even though there's clearly no need for a leader. - I'm having enough trouble running this island without a mutiny! - Who told you that you were running this island? - I am the skipper! - At sea you're the skipper, on land I am chairman of the board! (laughter) - Professor, will you tell these people who is in charge of this island? - Well actually no one is. - No one? - No one? Good heavens, this is anarchy! (laughter) - It is not, I am in command! - No I am running this island! - Gentlemen, gentlemen. - I've got an idea, I've got an idea. Why don't we vote? You know, like an election. (laughter) (crosstalk) - I'll spend millions on my campaign. - Shame on you. - What did I do? - Trying to buy my vote. - Well I did nothing of the kind, Mary Ann. It's perfectly proper for a presidential candidate to wanna hire a secretary. - At $50,000 a year? - Well good secretaries are hard to find. (laughter) I am not going to insult your intelligence by attempting to bribe you. - Gee Mr. Howell, I don't see what one thing has to do with the other. (laughter) - Are you suggesting that perhaps you could be bribed? Gilligan, how would you like to be Secretary of the Navy? (laughter) - Secretary of the Navy? You gotta be kidding. I don't even know how to tie a knot. - You're just being modest. - No I'm not. Look. (laughter) - Well whoever heard of the Secretary of the Navy tying his own knots? I'll assign some able-bodied seaman to perform such menial chores for you. - Where are we gonna find an able-bodied seaman? - Here comes one now. - Gilligan, why are you talking to Howell? - I'm sorry, Skipper. - Don't be afraid, Gilligan. In a few hours he'll be working for you. - What? - He means-- - What I mean is when I'm president, Gilligan is gonna be Secretary of the Navy. - Secretary of the Navy? Gilligan is going to be Secretary... (laughs) Well why aren't you laughing, Gilligan? - I was thinking how nice it would be to have someone to tie my shoelaces. (laughter) - [Narrator] The biggest problem with the democratic voting process is not simply that it can be bought, but rather that competency is not a requirement for office. And a president can be elected who is woefully under-qualified. - The deciding vote... Is missing. - Missing? - Oh yeah, I've got it right here. (laughter) - What's the matter Gilligan, isn't our ballot box good enough for you? - I was afraid it might get wet. - That means that I win! - That means I'm elected! - I'm sorry gentlemen, you both lost. - Well that's impossible! - Well then who is president? - Gilligan? (laughter) - President Gilligan. - [Narrator] The democratic social contract insists that maintaining the system is more important than everyone's survival. - I just came by here to offer my congratulations. People have made their choice, and whether it's right or wrong, we're stuck with it. - Well maybe we oughta count the votes again to make sure I won. - There's no need to do that either. Howell and I have counted them four times already. - Well I sure feel awful about winning. Especially when I wasn't even running. - The fact is you did win Gilligan, and that's why I'm here. I can hardly call myself a friend if I didn't give you a word of warning. - A word of warning? About what? - About the power seekers. Men who will seek you out, call themselves friends. They'll flatter you, they'll fawn on you. These men are dangerous. All they want is a high position in your government. These men are not to be trusted and you've got to guard against them. - Guard against them how? - [Narrator] Rather than improve efficiency, the creation of a government offers an opportunity for people to assume positions of power where they no longer have to work. - I just stopped by to offer you my hardiest congratulations on your rather shocking victory. (laughter) - Yeah, it was kinda a surprise to me too. - Yes, well the way I look at it, it could've been worse. (laughter) - If you're finished Howell, the president and I are busy setting up a new administration. - Well that's exactly why I'm here. - That's exactly what I thought. - Oh, Mr. President, before I forget, here is a small but terribly expensive little token of my esteem. - A box of esteemed tokens. Thanks, Mr. Howell. (laughter) - No no no, you see, they're solid gold cuff links. You'll have to have your wrists pierced. - I'm surprised by your attitude. - The leader's wish is but my command. - Then here, you can start by cleaning up the White House. That oughta be humble enough. - Just exactly who do you think you are? - I'm the Vice President! - The Vice President, well how did you get that job? - By getting here before you did! - Mr. Howell, do you want your cuff links back? - You think I'm the kind of man who would take back a bribe, sir? (laughter) - I'd like to give you something in return. - Well I expect to get something in return, what exactly do you have open? - Well we have the Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State-- - Yeah, you could be one of the secretaries, you know how to take shorthand typing? (laughter) - No, you see Mr. President, I think with my background, the ideal job for me would be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. - But that's a very important position, have you had any legal experience? - The government has convicted me six times on anti-trust suits, and I've been investigated every year for income tax evasion. (laughter) - Well that's good enough for me. How about you, Skipper? - Any many who can stay out of jail with a record like that's got to know something about the law. - Indeed I do! - Then we're behind you all the way, Mr. President. You're the best president we ever elected. - Thanks, Ginger. - I mean even if I don't get a star on my dressing room door. (laughter) - We're with you, sir. - Well then how about helping me dig the well? - I can't help you Mr. President, I'm in the midst of settling a strike. - What strike? - The Secretary of Health and Welfare won't help me in the kitchen anymore. - Well I'm not on strike, I have my own work to do now. How can I wash the dishes and build a hospital at the same time? - A hospital? What for, we don't even have a doctor! - Well when the hospital's finished, I'm going to build a medical school. (laughter) - Don't count on me sir, I'm involved in a very serious judicial matter. - What are you working on now, Mr. Howell? - Your impeachment! (upbeat orchestra music) - [Narrator] Just like the experiment of selecting a leader was not born of any real need, a system of law does not arise from any criminal activity, but rather nothing more than the realization that such a system, does not exist. - Now hold on Mr. Howell, at this point there's been no robbery, no murder, no crime of any kind on the island. You can see the necessity for some form of legal authority here on the island. - Exactly, what we need is law and order. - Well I'll make a check out to the Policeman's Benevolence Society. (laughter) - I suggest we elect a sheriff, and the sooner the better. - What about you, Professor? - No, I'm afraid I'm in the middle of an experiment with those phosphorescent rocks, I'm too busy trying to get us rescued. - I'm not too busy. - That's right, your place is in the laboratory. - I'm not doing anything at all, I could be the sheriff. - Ridiculous. - Preposterous. - How about a word from you, Professor? - Idiotic. - Sorry I asked. - No, in my opinion, the logical man for the job of sheriff is the Skipper. - Now we've gotta learn this criminal code, we've gotta practically memorize it. - [Narrator] Societal breakdown is inevitable because the rules themselves will always become more important than the social harmony they are designed to produce. (laughter) - [Mary Ann] Hi deputy. - Oh Gilligan! - Stop! (laughter) Hey ladies. - Ladies. (laughter) Gilligan, I'm waiting. - Sorry, sheriff. How am I doing, pretty good huh? Lucky thing I was here, there would have been a big collision. Just like a big fat truck running over two little sports cars. (laughter) - Thanks a lot. (blows whistle) - Gilligan, will you stop that blasted whistling? - I saw you Mr. Howell, stealing Skipper's binoculars. - I did not steal the binoculars, I merely borrowed them, Mrs. Howell and I are going birdwatching. - Well sorry Mr. Howell, according to the book, taking somebody else's property without their permission is stealing. - Are you gonna make such a fuss? We won't use them, we'll just watch bigger birds, that's all. - You're under arrest, Article Four. - Look look look look Gilligan, this is my first offense, I promise not to do such a dastardly deed again. - Ignorance of law is no excuse. (laughter) - Look look Gilligan, come on now, this will cover it. Let's just buy some tickets to the Policeman's Ball, eh? - Trying to bribe an officer on duty, Article Seven. - Look, I am not without political influence. I'll have you pounding a beat on the north end of this island! - Come on, let's go. (laughter) - I won't move! (choking) - We heard the whistle, what's going on? - Mr. Howell took your binoculars without your permission and that's stealing. Then when I caught him, he offered me money to forget it and that's bribery. So I arrested him. - Well deputy, you did right. You should be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Howell. - I am, I should have made it a bigger bribe. (laughter) - [Narrator] Democracy means the collective agreement to have rules is more important than whether those rules are just. - I mean the idea of being treated like a common criminal. - Now Mr. Howell. - Yes? - We all gave our word that we'd obey the law. - Well I know, but-- - And we agreed to accept the Skipper as the sheriff and Gilligan as his deputy. - Yeah I know, but-- - And we must agree to obey their authority, and to accept the penalty if we break the law. - But the whole thing sounds so darn democratic. (laughter) - Oh no Mr. Howell, you can't go back to your hut when you're under arrest. You have to go to... Where are we gonna put him? - I don't know. We've never talked about that. - Well there's only one thing we can do. (laughter) (sobs) - Thurston, you're a convict! - It's just not right Mary Anne, Gilligan just went too far. - Well after all Ginger, he is a deputy. He's just doing his duty. - [Narrator] In addition to creating rules that are unworkable, the legal system creates a corrupt power dynamic. - Now look Gilligan, I'm gonna be gone most of the day, so I want you to keep an eye on things. - You mean I'm in charge? - I mean you are in complete charge. See you later, girls. - Bye. (laughter) - That's a pretty big responsibility, right Ginger? - Doubt if we're going to have a crime wave. - You never can tell, right? - Right, if I see any suspicious characters lurking around, I'll be sure and call headquarters. - That's the spirit. Oh, by the way girls, that fire's too close to the hut. - It's where we always used to have it. - Well ignorance of the law is no excuse. I'll have to put it out. Ooh, ooh! (laughter) (laughs) That's not funny, Ginger. You're under arrest for violation of Section 33 of the Municipal Code. - Oh let me go! - As an officer of the law, I'm gonna-- - Let her go! - I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mary Ann. - Oh and what are you gonna do about it? Let me out of here! (laughter) - What are you in for, Mary Ann? - Aiding and abetting someone who was resisting arrest while violating ordinance 33 of the Municipal Code. (laughter) - That's a serious charge, and you Ginger? - For being dumb enough to let him grab me. - We found this streak of phosphorescent rock in the side of a hill. - How'd you get it out? - Why with this stick of true dynamite that I made. - Professor, you never should have done that. - Well it was the only way we could get the rock. - I don't mean that, I mean you never should have done that. - Done what? Carrying concealed weapons. (laughter) - You what? - Mr. Howell for attempted jailbreak, Mary Ann for aiding and abetting, Ginger for the municipal code-- - Gilligan, how could you do such a thing? - It wasn't easy, the girls put up a good fight. (laughter) - A good officer knows how to use his power, not misuse it. - The law is the law. - Gilligan! - You said go by the book and I went by the book! - Gilligan, you lamebrain, give me that key! - No, sticks and stones can break my bones-- - Yeah, that's not the only thing that's gonna hurt you! Now I intend to get that key if I have to shake it out of you! What did I do? - You remember when you were shaking me, trying to make the key fall out? - So? - That's police brutality. (laughter) - Gilligan, give me that key! - [Narrator] Ultimately, potential for rescue is sabotaged by the obsession with adhering to law. - That just about completes the search area. - Well we better get turned around. - There's one more little island I think we oughta check out, it's not on the map, but I recall it being just south of here. - A plane! We're going to be rescued! - They'll see our signal! (cheering) (laughter) (uplifting orchestra music) - Well I didn't see anything. - No sir, no people down there. - There's the phosphorescent rocks! - I do hope they hadn't misspelled SOS. (laughter) - Tell them, Skipper. - We didn't have time to put the signal rocks out. - Why not? - Because some numbskull put us in jail! (upbeat orchestra music) - [Narrator] The final pillar of American democracy, the justice system, is established in response to a dispute over ownership of property. - Gilligan, what are you down here? You're supposed to be cutting bamboo poles. - I'm digging a barbecue pit for Mr. Howell. - Gilligan, I think you've uncovered a treasure chest. Must be a fortune in this chest. Come on, let's try and get this padlock and chain. Just think little buddy, by this time tomorrow you might be a millionaire. What are you gonna do with all that money? - First thing I'm gonna do is buy something to open up that chest. You really think I'm a millionaire? - Sure, it's your chest, you found it didn't you? - Oh yeah. - Well finder's keepers. - Are you positive that treasure chest belongs to you? - Well of course, Gilligan was working for me at the time when he was digging and found it. He was in my employee, all big business operates that way. I still don't see how you're gonna open the chest this way. - Very simple, Mr. Howell. All we have to do is cut the vine. The chest falls and its own weight will break those seams wide open when it hits the ground. - I must say, that's very clever, I must reward you with part of my treasure chest. - Your treasure chest? That treasure is Gilligan's. - Gilligan's? - Well of course, he found it, didn't you? - Yeah, you were with me, don't you remember? (laughter) - Of course I remember. - But he was working for me, therefore the treasure is mine. - Finder's keepers. - But that's ridiculous, it is a practice of any large corporation. - Gilligan is not a corporation. - I'm not even a business. - I still say the treasure chest is mine. - That treasure chest is Gilligan's. - So that's the treasure chest huh? - [Gilligan] That's right, Professor. - Well it certainly looks like the real thing. But I understand there's a question as to the ownership. - Yeah, that's why we're playing one game of poker, winner take all. - Back home you would never play a game of cards for anything so important. - Yes, but back home there are laws about such things, this fellow was in my employee. - Yeah, well the law says finder's keepers. - Well if you're interested in law, there's only one way to settle this thing legally. A court trial. - A court trial here on this island? - Why not? As the law say. (speaks foreign language) - What does that mean? - Your case comes up Tuesday. - [Narrator] The trial preparations and arguments are fairly sophisticated. - Well confidentially not Lovey, you see this isn't an open and shut case, while I did hire Gilligan, I didn't actually pay him, and the Skipper might use that as a loophole. - Loophole, oh you know all the legal terms. - Why not, after all I watched Perry Mason for six years. (laughter) I could close that loophole if... - If what, dear? - If I can get Gilligan to take the money now. (chuckles) I wanna pay you for the work that you did for me. - But Mr. Howell, I never finished digging the barbecue pit, I only dug for 10 minutes. - Well at least let me pay you for the time that you dug. Will $100 be enough? - $100? That's almost $500 an hour. - 600, but who's counting? (laughter) - Gilligan, don't take that money! (laughter) - Why not, Skipper? - Gilligan, he's hoping that you'll take the money because it'll strengthen his claim on the treasure chest. From now on, Mr. Howell, you are not to talk to my client. - All right, I'll see you in court. (laughter) - Mr. Howell wants you to do something for him. He showed you where he wanted the barbecue pit. He never mentioned the word job, never talked about money, and never paid you a penny. - Tampering with a witness. I'll file charges! - [Narrator] Ultimately, the justice system is shown to curate the very problems it was designed to resolve. Instead of settling a dispute and making life better, this court is intensified and the castaways all sue each other. - I hope you're not thinking of offering me a bribe. - Why of course not, but do you recall two weeks ago at dinner when I asked someone to pass me the papaya juice and you did? Well I wanna pay you for that service. $5,000 be enough? - No, no, no. (laughter) - I caught you red-handed Howell, trying to bribe a public official. Your honor, I wanna file charges. - First trial hasn't even started and I've already got two more cases on the docket. (laughter) - Everyone take their places! The first superior court of this island is now in session! The honorable Professor presiding! - Be seated. Since everyone is familiar with the case, we will dispense with the reading of the complaint and counter-charges. - Your honor, I feel that they've rehearsed her testimony. - No more than he's rehearsed Gilligan's. - And you brought me up before this court on charges, well I wanna file charges, your honor! - All right, but you'll have to wait your turn, that will be case number four. Now please, let us get on with the testimony. - Do you recall hearing me say that I was hiring Gilligan? - Yes Mr. Howell, you told me that you had just hired Gilligan to dig the barbecue pit. - Howell bribed her the same way he tried to bribe you! - That is defamation of character, I wanna sue that man for liable and slander! - That'll be case number five. (laughter) - He said I was bribed. I wanna file charges too. - Case number six. - [Narrator] The resolution to all of these conflicts emerges when the Professor rejects the entire notion of private property and affirms that on the island, they're all communists. - Ladies and gentlemen, I have reached a decision. - Well don't keep the boy waiting any longer. Tell him I've won the verdict. - I can't tell him that. - Oh Gilligan, that means the treasure chest is yours! - Now wait, wait, Gilligan didn't win either. - Huh? - Well let me explain. Ever since we were shipwrecked on this island we've shared the hardships, the work, the fish we catch, the fruit, the water, everything. We've shared and we've shared alike. And I choose to look upon the treasure chest as one of the natural resources of this island by custom and usage defacto. It belongs to all of us. - Well let's go open it, come on, come on. - [Narrator] Despite the Professor's decree, lapses routinely take place that reveal the role capitalism plays in social dysfunction. (dramatic orchestra music) As more European regimes topple and succumb to Soviet control, fear of Communism gripped America. - [Announcer] Ever hear of Karl Marx? In his mind, Communism was born more than a hundred years ago. He looked at the world and saw men as divided into two classes: workers and capitalists. In the Communist Manifesto he called upon the workers, proletarians, to rise up and overthrow their capitalistic masters. He cried "The proletarians have "nothing to lose but their chains. "They have a world to win. "working men of all countries, unit." - Communism in reality is not a political party. It is a way of life, an evil and malignant way of life. It reveals a condition akin to disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic a quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting this nation. - [Announcer] In recognizing a Communist, physical appearance counts for nothing. If he openly declares himself to be a Communist, we take his word for it. If a person supports organizations which reflects Communist teachings, or organizations labeled Communist by the Department of Justice, she may be a Communist. If a person defends the activities of Communist nations while consistently attacking the domestic and foreign policy of the United States, she may be a Communist. If a person does all these things over a period of time, he must be a Communist. But there are other Communists who don't show their real faces. Who work more silently. - Probably the key thing that Marx kept coming back to time and time again in his writing was the alienation of the worker. - I want you up and on the beach first thing in the morning ready to work. - The worker who makes something is alienated or estranged from the product he creates because it doesn't belong to him. The product belongs to his employer, the person who owns the company or the stockholders who own the company, and the way in which it's produced, and actually the design of the product is not under the control of the worker either. So Marx said that since the worker is forced to make things which his own personality is not invested, then he becomes alienated or estranged from that thing that he makes. - You mean this yellow stuff that looks like gold? - Yes, yes, what is it? - I think it is gold! - Gold? Gold! (screams) (laughter) Gold, Gilligan! I'm richer! Hurt a little, but I'm richer. - [Narrator] When gold is discovered on the island, the mine is considered public property, but the labor required to extract the gold becomes commodified. - I'm gonna hire you to mine the gold, you see. I won't pay you enough to cause you any trouble. Then I'll hide it so no one will ever be able to find it. How's that? - Promise you'll tell me where you put it? - Scout's honor. - Three. - Oh. (laughter) - You want me to dig anymore? - Certainly, it's only 4 AM. - [Narrator] By hiring Gilligan to extract the gold, Mr. Howell establishes private equity. The castaways make a plea for communal ownership, but Mr. Howell refuses. - Mr. Howell, I know you, I know that deep down in your soul you're a wonderful, generous man, and you wanted to share your gold with all of us. - Yes I did. But thank goodness I fought off that nasty impulse. The answer is still no! (laughter) - [Narrator] Predictably, the introduction of a capital-based economy causes social breakdown by creating a demand for payment for all goods and services. - I hope the lobster wasn't too rich for you. - Well if he was, he didn't get a chance to mention it. (laughter) - Thurston, you know I think it's rude to talk about money at the table in front of a strange lobster. (laughter) - Will that be all sir? - Yes, that'll be all. - Here you are. - What is this? - That's the dinner check. - $740? (laughter) - Seafood salad $175? - Lobster 200? - Grapefruit muffins 125, side order of guava jelly 50. - So that's your little game huh? First the Skipper, then Gilligan. You're gonna charge us for our meals huh? Well! - That's a fine kettle of fish! - Thanks for reminding me, Mrs. Howell. - For what? - One kettle of fish, $300. (laughter) - Well if $600 is all you can spend, take only three candles. - What? - You can't beat that price anyplace on the island. - Please Thurston, you can't see a thing down in that mine. - All right, I'll take six candles, give the man $1,200. - $50 more, Mr. Howell, and I can gift wrap these for you. - No, $1,200 for the six and that's my last offer. - Well you're the man with the gold mine. Oh by the way, as long as you're here Mr. Howell, would you like to look at some wicks? - You mean there aren't any wicks in these candles? (laughter) - Not for this kind of money. (upbeat orchestra music) - It was Mad Magazine I think that came up with the joke about under Capitalism, man exploits man, under Communism it's the other way around. Well in the ideal Communist society there would be no exploitation. There would be no alienation. People would work together, there would be cooperation. There would be no government because there was no need for a state. - The ideal society is a society that is bountiful for its members, which is fair and just, to the maximum degree possible. That's the ideal society. - Skipper, we're on land now. When we're on land we both have equal rights. - What was that? - I said I got rights too! - When you say what we want is not a capitalist society necessarily or a socialist society necessarily or a communist society necessarily, what we want is a society in which most people are prosperous or at least getting what they want and need, where most people feel that they're treated fairly and justly, where the law seems to protect the less advantaged as well as the advantaged. - If you look at utopias they're famously unpleasant to live in. In Thomas Moore's Utopia, 1516, which coined the word Utopia, there's no private property and everyone switches houses with everyone else. (upbeat orchestra music) - [Announcer] Calling the House Unamerican Activities Committee to order, Chairman J. Parnell Thomas of New Jersey opens an inquiry into possible Communist penetration of the Hollywood film industry. The committee is seeking to determine if red party members have reached the screen with subversive propaganda. - [Narrator] Formed in 1938 to investigate citizens who might be disloyal or have ties to Communism, the House Committee on Unamerican Activities began targeting suspects whom they believed to be influential, which often included people in entertainment and the media. For many, simply being called before the committee led to losing their job and their friends. ♪ Joe, come here a minute ♪ ♪ I got a red hot tip for you, Joe ♪ ♪ See that guy with the red suspenders ♪ ♪ Driving that car with the bright red fenders ♪ ♪ I know he's one of those heavy spenders ♪ ♪ Get that Communist, Joe ♪ ♪ He's filling my gal with propaganda ♪ ♪ And I'm scared she will meander ♪ ♪ Don't wanna take a chance where he'll land her ♪ ♪ Get that Communist, Joe ♪ ♪ He's the most revolting character ♪ ♪ And the fellas hate him so ♪ ♪ But with the girls this character ♪ ♪ Is a comrade Romeo ♪ ♪ Since my love he's sabotaging ♪ - [Announcer] Often operating as a one man committee, he has traveled far, interviewed many, terrorized some. Accused civilian and military leaders of the past administration of a great conspiracy to turn over the country to Communism. Wait 'till you hear the bleeding hearts scream and cry about our methods of trying to drag the truth from those who know or should know, who covered up a fifth amendment Communist major. But they say oh, it's all right to uncover them, but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy. - The line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. - If you think that I am going to cooperate with this collection of Judases, of men who sit there in violation of the United States Constitution. If you think I'll cooperate with you in any way, you are insane. (applause) - There were all kinds of anti-communists in the United States in those years. There were some whose position was rather simple and it was more anti-soviet than anti-communist, often the people who took these positions didn't even really know what Communism is or was, and you can be sure they never read the Communist Manifesto of 1848. - Many of the anti-communists, especially the McCarthyite's type, were just, it was just words to them, they had no idea what Communism was. - This is what the Communists say about our public school system. The whole American school system acts in the spirit of a militaristic program. The syllabuses and textbooks in American schools are imbued with racist ideology and teach hatred to everything outstanding and advanced. The word peace is forbidden in American schools. - We oughta stop fooling around with talking diplomacy and show the Communists we mean business. - [Announcer] Under Communism virtually everything belongs to the state. The individual has little right to own property, or to plan his own life. He's told where to work with his employer. Little freedom to leave his job or seek a better one. - Marx said that, in pure Communism, not only would there be no classes, there'd be no government. - There was nothing wrong with Communism in theory, but it was the way it was being implemented and practiced in the Soviet Union as a totalitarian society in which everyone was required to conform to the dictates of the state. Which was exactly the opposite of what Marx had envisioned. - We'll all be saved by great and glorious Soviet Navy. They shall come and take us all back home to Moscow. - Oh boy, we're going home to Moscow! (gentle orchestra music) - [Narrator] In addition to adhering to the actual principles of Communism, the castaways are guided by the spirit of comradery. - It'll be a lot quicker and a lot easier if we all pitch in and work together. Remember the old saying, united we stand. - I was just thinking what a waste my life's been. I mean so I was an actress, so what? I never really did anything for anyone. - Well you entertained people. - Oh that was just for the moment. I mean really do something important. Like being a nurse. Although I was a nurse, for one day I was Ben Casey's nurse. (laughter) And you know something, Professor? In that one hour we saved six people, and if it hadn't been for the commercials we would've saved eight. (laughter) - You're right Ginger, that's what's important. Saving people. - That's one thing you can always count on, when you've lost everything, I mean friendship does mean more than money doesn't it? - We've all gotta pitch in and work hard. - I've been thinking about life, you never know what to expect. - You can say that again. - Like 10 years ago, who would have figured we'd be here on this island, sharing our load and pulling for the common cause. - Everybody shared everything and everybody pitched in and helped and I think that's just calling good neighbors. We did that when we were pioneers going into the west, we all built each other's houses and painted our walls. - We've got to function as a group! - You're right, Skipper. - We've lived here together, and if necessary, we'll die together. - The Flintstones and The Jetsons are almost the same show, they use the same gags. I think it's the same way with Capitalism and Communism. The more you strive towards complete atomism, the idea that every person is in it for himself, the more you reduce people to machines of appetite being driven by vectors of desire and behaving according to purely predictable and sociologically intelligible forces. In other words, you start to see these little atoms as part of a Brownian movement or some sort of physics of, part of a system of physical forces in which the group starts to be more important than the individual because you've broken it down to pure individuals governed by forces. Similarly in Communism, if the state is to wither away, what's left is a bunch of happy people living according to their own desires. (upbeat orchestra music) - I'm sorry Mr. Howell, unless I can figure out a way to make everybody share it, nobody gets it. - As long as we're all on this island together, it's not gonna make any difference to any one of us whether you have any money or not. - Private property is essentially fictitious, and Capitalism has always been driven by that anxiety because Capitalism depends on the idea that I'm a free agent and I can not only barter my talents, which are plausibly enough mine, but I can also barter the things I own which are very feebly mine. When the anarchist Proudhon said property is theft, he was saying something that is worth thinking about. That's always been the strongest point of Communism. - Boy, I can't wait to tell the Professor about this, and the Skipper and the girls, we'll all be rich. - All? - Sure, Mr. Howell. Don't you remember? We all made an agreement to share everything on the island. - Yes, yes, I do recall making that agreement, but of course then we didn't expect to find a gold mine, you understand? Don't you know what gold does to people, Gilligan? - Uh-huh, makes them rich. (laughter) - It makes them greedy. (upbeat orchestra music) - It's true that Marx also had a, he was very much against religion because he figured things like religion and philosophy, which he was one, a philosopher, things of the mind were really super structure, these were secondary, tertiary even, results of the economic base. - Why don't I buy you out, say for $20 million? - Buy me for money? Bah humbug! - Bah on money? What are you, some kind of an atheist? - Religion, he saw as just a means of keeping the oppressed suppressed. In his ideal society there would be no need for religion. - Skipper, I recall reading in Professor Oldenberg's text on primitive tribes and customs that the more primitive the tribe, the more superstitious it is. - Well with this bunch we must have hit the jackpot. - And they're terrified of various gods. Now listen, if we could convince them that we were gods with mystical powers, they might flee and panic. (upbeat orchestra music) - So individuals could fulfill their full potential. As whatever they wanted to be, they could be artists, philosophers, as Marx said, they could hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, and recite poetry in the evening. - Your excellency. - I am ready. - Ready for what? - To be executed. - Don't be ridiculous. - Well then you're going to exile me of course. - Well I never heard such nonsense. - Then what will become of me? - You will become a member of our little community. - You mean become one of the masses? (laughter) - I don't like to think of ourselves that way. We're a free society and you will be free to do or become whatever you want. - Anything? - The idea was from each according to his ability to each according to his needs. If someone needed more to survive, not because they were greedy, but to have a good quality of life, then that person should get more. People who didn't require so much would get less, but each of them would be contributing their own talents to society. - Pretty soon the vegetables will be ready, Gilligan will pick them, Mary Ann will clean them, and Ginger will prepare them. - Yes, but on second thought, oughtn't we do something? - Oh perish the thought, every hive must have a queen, the rest are workers. - Yes, but I feel a little guilty. Maybe we should make some kind of an effort. - What do you suggest? - Well we could be host and hostess at a dinner party. - A vegetarian do. - In an ideal Communist society one would be contributing one's talents, so if one had talents as an actor, one would be allowed to do that. ♪ I wanna be loved by you ♪ ♪ By you and nobody else but you ♪ ♪ I wanna be loved by you ♪ ♪ Alone ♪ ♪ Boop-oop-a-doop ♪ (applause) (dramatic orchestra music) - I'm going to explain to you the system of warning signals that will be used in this country in the event of a nuclear attack. First, the red warning. (siren blaring) - [Announcer] In the cities, police and civil defense teams clear the streets. Meanwhile, from the Pentagon and other key points, top defense figures are airlifted to secret control centers from where they would direct America's defense and counterattack. It was estimated over four million would have died in New York City. No estimates were given for the rest of the country, but the grim arithmetic took on new impact for all who took part in Operation Alert. - [Announcer] Whatever kind of shelter you find, settle down and make the best of it.

The bomb itself will kill you. - [Narrator] In addition to the turmoil caused by the attempts to adopt components of democracy, threats to the idyllic lifestyle come from the outside world as well. - Uncle Sam was this rapacious image, was very greedy, wanting to become wealthier and wealthier at the expense of the worker, and was wanting to spread this imperialist power throughout the world so that the wealthy Capitalists could make more money. - Well you can't quit now, we need them to get rescued! - I hate being a girl, besides he was touching my knee. - Small price to pay for civilization, come on, my boy! (laughter) Follow me! - [Narrator] Civilization is depicted as being fixated on military aggression and constructing weapons of war that inevitably come into contact with the island. - Projected power of this new warhead is fantastic. Everything within a radius of 100 miles will be totally destroyed. No habitation, no people. - [Lieutenant] That's wonderful, sir. - That's approximately our position here. - [Broadcaster] The countdown has already started on Operation Powder Keg. Five, four, three, two, one. Zero! (tense orchestra music) (screaming) (laughter) - Throw it, throw it! Throw it, throw it! (laughter) - The ape was obviously on the island during the war. He saw the soldiers using the weapons and decided that's the way men play together. - [Narrator] In October of 1962, the two world powers prepared for nuclear war after surveillance photos reveal Soviet constructed missile sites in Cuba. - [Announcer] And authorities assembled thousands in cities and villages for patriotic rallies. As in the past, these rallies are designed to whip up hate of what Castro calls Yankee imperialistic warmongers. Through suggestions that a UN team inspect missile sites, Castro said that they had better come ready for combat. He went on to call President Kennedy a pirate for setting up the quarantine. - Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the western hemisphere. - In my country there is a saying. He who has gun is the leader. March and take my bag with you. Hand up. (laughter) - Are we going to submit or subvert? - I vote for subversion. May the Harbor Club have mercy on my soul. (laughter) - Where do we begin? - With his gun. - [Narrator] To further emphasize the corrupt nature of the outside world, when objects wash ashore, they are often contaminated by radioactivity, or are capable of mass destruction. (laughter) (ticking) - That's a World War II mine. - I told you, I told you. - It's been a long time since I've seen one of those babies, why I remember-- - Shhh, it's ticking. - Ticking? That means it's activated! Let's get out of here, it's liable to blow up! - Yeah, let's go! - It's no use, it won't help us to run. - But it won't hurt us any. Oh I get it. If that mine blows up with 600 pounds of explosives, powee! - Powee? - Right, it would cause such a chain reaction that the entire island would be demolished. So you see, if it goes off, it doesn't make any difference where you are. - Look. This looks like we found something real good this time, huh? - Plastics don't explode. - But plastic explosives explode. - Explosives? (laughter) (cheery orchestra music) Oh boy, packages of seeds. - Gilligan, is this your idea of some kind of a joke? - Look, a falling star! - I believe it's gonna hit the island. (loud explosion) - This simple form of Geiger counter will be able to tell us whether that meteor is radioactive. - Oh Professor, if it is, it's absolutely deadly. - I'm afraid it's rather difficult to walk. - This lead makeup sure feels funny, Professor. - Well we need it to protect our faces from the cosmic rays. - [Narrator] The corrosive effects of capitalism and imperialism are displayed by the people who arrive on the island. They're often deviant criminals and power-seeking despots. - Hold it! So now you know. Before too long, a boat will arrive to pick me up. Until that time, I don't want any problems. If any problems do arise, I won't hesitate to eliminate them. Any questions? - Any bullets in that gun? (gunshot) (laughter) - So you see, he's a victim of his environment. Ever since he's been a child he's been surrounded by crime, and it's up to us to welcome him back to society. Give him a chance to prove himself again. - We used to play, but not football or baseball. We used to play cops and robbers. And I was always the cop. Never the good guy. (laughter) (playful orchestra music) - Wake up, young man. - I'm awake Skipper, I'm awake. - I have come to rescue you. (screams) (laughter) - Comrade Igor and I are colonels in Soviet space program. I regret to say that we have missed landing target and landed here by accident. - Have you ever heard of a space capsule with a one way radio? - Come to think of it, no. - Professor, what are you driving at? - The possibility that those Russians didn't land here by mistake. - You mean they're planning to take over the island and use it for a base? - You know who I am, Gilligan. - I know who you are, Gilligan. (laughter) - No no no no, I'm Dr. Boris Balinkoff. - The mad scientist. - No, scientist yes, mad no. (maniacal laugh) - You have any game on this island? - Game? Yeah, the SKipper's got some checkers and I've got a deck of cards. - No no, I mean do you have any wild goat or wild boar? - No no, we don't have any game like that at all on the island. I gotta go tell the others. - Seven people on this island and nobody knows they're here. That's very interesting. Ramon, we're going hunting. - But you not hear? No game on island. - Perhaps not the four legged kind. But I've always wondered what it would be like to track down and kill the most challenging of all game. Man. (laughter) - Calling W-9, you there? - [W-9] I am here, go ahead. - We can now claim island. - [W-9] Squatters are dead? - [Ghost] Very dead. - You were right, Professor. - Whoever did this thinks we are now dead right? All right then, we'll be dead. - [Narrator] The remaining visitors are typically self-absorbed and morally bankrupt. - Did you come here to rescue us? - Actually I'm here to look for a deserted island to build a resort hotel. - Gilligan, this is the world famous, the world famous, Erika Tiffany Smith! - Wow, three names. (laughter) - Much more, my name is Lady Erika Tiffany, the Countess of Capri, the Baroness of Blenford, and the Duchess of Devonshire and Smith. - I'm listening to a very important radio program, it's called Take A Dare, and they're talking about a guy on a deserted island. - Oh there's nothing I'd rather hear more. (upbeat orchestra music) - [Host] And Barkley, you have no fishing equipment or tool correct? - [George] That's right. - [Host] Then how do you catch fish and open coconuts? - I use my bare hands. (laughter) - Wow, he must be a powerful man. - It's uncanny. - You'll never get away with it. - Sorry you can't come to the party tonight. I'll explain that you're all tied up. (laughter) - Lovey, don't you recognize your own husband? - Well I recognize his clothes on that one. - Yup, that's Mr. Howell all right. - Don't you see that this scoundrel swam ashore, wrapped me in the head, dragged me in the jungle and change clothes with me. - Fantastic story. - I don't know what to think. (tense orchestra music) (primal yell) - Gilligan! - We've got to be able to use your transmitter. - To call boat? - Yes. - No. - No? - Yes, no. (laughter) 10 years ago, Dubov don't like critics. Dubov don't like people. Dubov don't like Dubov, so come to island. - Oh I think you're a real nice guy, don't you Professor? - I think he's one of the most charming, personable, most likable people I've ever met in my whole life. - Now where's the transmitter? - When Dubov is ready, Dubov call Bob. - All right men, now hear this. We're not splitting from this island for two months. - Two months? (laughter) - Maybe longer. That crazy scene last night wound us up tighter than Presley's pants. (laughter) - The Mosquitoes left us a message. - A message? - They can write? - Apparently. Hi gang, me and the boys... "Me and the boys." Decided to take off this morning when the helicopter came by with provisions. As for The Honeybees-- - As for The Honeybees? As for The Honeybees, you're good gals, but just a little too good, and we've got enough competition. - Well hear this and hear this good, right now a couple of my flunkies are following me in a plane. If you and your friends wanna be my guests in a free ride back to civilization-- - We do, we do! - Then remember one thing, the key word around here is cooperation! That is the word, cooperation! Now who gives the orders around here? - Mr. Harold Hecuba. - Mr. Harold Hecuba. - That's better. - This may be one of the reasons why Gilligan's Island was so popular. Not at a conscious level, but at a subconscious level, the notion of getting away from the rat race, the competition of capitalism, being off on an island with other people who, although you may have disagreements with, ultimately everything was resolved within half an hour, and all the problems were solved. Until the next episode. - [Narrator] When Gilligan foils a rescue attempt, it may have been intentional and done with everyone's tacit concent. - [Skipper Voiceover] Gilligan, his bungling, that disarming grin on his face. Could it all be an act? (laughter) - What is it? - Help, we are marooned on a desert island. They spelled maroon wrong. - Let me see that. Gilligan, this is the note that you wrote! - Oh yeah, I don't know how to spell maroon. - Give me that! (laughter) - Igor. You believe they are shipwrecked? - Of course not. - Must be secret American space program. - These Americans, they think they can fool us. - Especially Gilligan. He acts too stupid to be stupid. - Must be the cleverest one of them all. (laughter) - [Narrator] With nothing to return home to, the show suggests the rescue attempts are only half-hearted, and the castaways don't actually want to leave the island. - Look on the bright side Ginger, maybe we'll never be rescued and maybe we'll be marooned on this island the rest of our lives. There'll be no Broadway, no play, no nothing. - What's taking everybody so long? - Maybe nobody wants to leave. - Well of course everybody's anxious to leave, Gilligan. - I'm not. - Certainly, everybody wants to get back to civilization. - I had fun here. - But Gilligan, there'll be people on the streets. - Yeah, pushing and shoving. - And restaurants. - Waiting for a table. - And you'll get paid for a day's work. - Who cares about money? - Oh Captain, Mr. Howell would never forget you. If it weren't for you wrecking the boat, we wouldn't any of us be here. (laughter) - [Thurston] It's so true. - Hi Skipper. The raft's almost finished, all we need is some planking and a sail and-- - Pardon me. (laughter) - What are you doing? - I'm destroying the raft. - Pardon me. - Huh? (laughter) What are you doing? - Destroying the raft. If the world is lucky we'll never get rescued. (laughter) (off-key singing) - That boy has flipped his bonnet, I say! - I'm not going. - After I reserved first class passage for seven people? - It's not fair leaving the professor here by himself. Excuse me. - But you can't stay alone with him, it's not proper. (laughter) Thurston, they need a chaperone. - Darling, they're going to miss you at the horse show. (laughter) - Not me, you! - Oh Lovey. - I can't Skipper, I can't leave the Professor and Mary Ann and the Howells here. - Count me out too. Hollywood will just have to do without me. - Are they gonna send a boat after us? - So we can be rescued. - Did you notify any authority? - Certainly not, what in the world would I do a thing like that for? - So we can get off the island. - And leave this paradise? (laughter) - You mean to say that nobody knows that you're here? - To tell the truth, I don't know where I am. - Man, you guys ain't lost, you're hiding! (laughter) - I'm leaving a message here for anybody who might be shipwrecked in the next million years in case they wanna get off. (laughter) - A message? - What message? (laughter) - Home sweet home. (laughter) (uplifting orchestra melody) (upbeat ukulele music) - [Interviewer] I know you get asked this all the time, the Professor can make a radio out of a coconut, why can't he fix the boat? ♪ Only one thing that will stop them ♪ ♪ And their atrocious bunch ♪ ♪ If General MacArthur drops an atomic bomb ♪ - I could repair a boat in theory, but not in practice. ♪ But they died just like heroes ♪ ♪ Amid the many shot and killed ♪ ♪ They had their hands tied behind them ♪ ♪ And were murdered by the score ♪ ♪ By those dirty minded Communists ♪ - I have a boat. Several, I have not build a boat, but if I had to I think I could. ♪ And the radioactivity will burn them to the ground ♪ ♪ If there's any Commies left they'll be all on the run ♪ - I could build a boat, the question is will it float? (laughs) - Professor, what exactly are your degrees? - Well I have a BA from USC, a BS from UCLA, an MA from MSU, and a PhD from TCU. ♪ Old hard headed Joe will be feeling mighty blue ♪ ♪ When he finds out he's bitten off more than he can chew ♪ - The reason I could make a radio out of a coconut and not get us off the island is because I'm from MIT. ♪ Old MacArthur has the power ♪ ♪ To stop those murdering thieves ♪ ♪ And he'll make them sorry for their underhanded schemes ♪ ♪ Just leave it to the general for he really has the nerve ♪ ♪ To give those no good Communists just what they deserve ♪ - I read that with some surprise. And I sent them, in their letters to the editor, I sent them a letter, and it said thank you for placing me in such great company, I said, but about the order. (laughs)
