I was right. You are Larry Gordon. Unfortunately madam, yes. I knew it. When I saw... If you'll just pass me the book, I'll... Oh thank you. You see, it's your very latest. I'm a great fan of yours, mister Gordon. How very nice for you. You know, I find your stories so stimulating. They make you think. Mind you, they lack subtly but what they lack in subtly, they make up for in characterization. And your plots are so intriguing. Oh do tell me, how do you begin to write a book? Where do you start? You're going just a bit too fast. But it's so exciting talking to a real author. Do tell me how you write a mystery. Oh, you sure it won't bore you? Bore me? Why I should enjoy every minute of it. All right. Well first of all, you have an idea. Yes. Ideas arise out of most normal circumstances. Then you develop it. What is that? Might've been the train whistle. Or a scream. It seemed to come from outside this window. The engine. Well don't stand on ceremony. We both know what it is. Have you found something? When did this train last stop? At pickering about two hours ago. Two hours? That's funny. There's still snow on the floor. Well obviously the door's been recently opened. Oh no. I'm afraid so. Maybe the window was open and the guard closed it. No, I don't think so. Do you think there's been an accident? Something like that. What are you going to do? Who's in here? Well it says reserved. It's locked. Hi. Sorry to trouble you but I'm looking for a friend. You got the wrong compartment. Don't you think we better get the guard? Yes we will, but first I wanna check the remainder of this coach. I don't see why anyone should walk the length of a train in order to have an accident in the first coach. Please forgive me, but is anyone sharing this compartment? There was another gentleman, but he got out at pickering. Yes, that's quite right, sir. I joined the train there myself. What's he like in case he comes in here? Oh, oh. Don't you think you better tell them the truth? They may be able to help. She means my friend may be slightly under the influence of drinking. Not expensive but nice perfume. Well we better go for the ticket collector or the guard. Haven't you forgotten the closed compartment with the drawn blinds? Trust you to remember that. What did you say? Well you'll never know what it's inside there unless you knock. Anything wrong? Our friend in there has a gun. Well why don't you knock enough? Did you say a gun? I think you better find the guard. There's no one here. Why don't you wait here? It won't take me long to find someone. If you think I'm staying within 100 miles of that gun, you're very much mistaken. Besides, I'm quite capable of walking through a train. I'd think you're quite capable of walking through anything. Shall we go? I think perhaps we better get back. We were probably mistaken. All right come out and don't try any tricks. Oh, may I ask what you're doing? Looking for our basket. Is that true? No. You see, they're probably gunman's moms. What's the old dame talking about? Well. What's the trouble? Well it's very simple really. We happened to be broke. And that looked like a good hiding place. We're in show business. She means we were. Show business? That's a very nice perfume you're wearing. Is he dead? Who are you? I'm the ticket collector. Oh but that's impossible. We saw the ticket collector go to the front of the train just before we came in here. All that I can say, miss, is that it wasn't me. Were you wearing your coat when you were knocked out? My coat's gone. Yes, someone's going to get into trouble for this. It's against the regulation. You three stay here. That goes for you, too. Someone didn't want to be disturbed. You got your key? It was in me coat. What's going on in here? Someone cosh me and then pinch me coat. Well it wasn't him. They're the ones that found me. You mind telling me what you know about this, sir. Just as he says. We found him there and that's all. That's not all. What about the scream we heard? Well that was probably Fred you heard. I happened to be travelling in the first compartment and that scream came from outside the window. Of course I'm telling you the truth. And we haven't told you about the gun. What gun? It's perfectly true. This lady and I saw a man in one of the port compartments with a gun. Well I think it's high time we got a look at this coach. Watch that door, Fred, and don't let anyone in or out. Don't let anybody in or out. Sorry to bother you, sargent, but we've had some trouble in the guard's Van. Well what kind of trouble? The ticket collector's been attacked. Well where's Blake? He didn't pass me. That's what I get for letting him stretch his legs. I told him to stay outside the door. Is he a big man? Yes why? Well I saw the ticket collector speaking to a big man outside of this compartment. How long ago? 15, 20 minutes ago. I thought you said the ticket collector was hurt? So he is. I think we better all go to the guard's Van. Will you find Blake for me? All right Harding, we're going for a walk. No tricks. Is that the Harding? That's right, madam. Steve Harding. He's coming up tomorrow to stand in for murder. And he was in the next compartment to me all the time? You were safe enough. Well. This much we do know. You two ladies were hiding in here. While you were both in here, are you positive that no one went through that door? How could they, officer? The door was locked. That'll be all, miss. You're miss Jessica Owens travelling to Stanton. That is correct. You and mister Gordon heard a scream? Mister Gordon. Isn't it wonderful to have a great writer in our midst? Miss Owens, I'm not a great writer. Just so happens that my crime novels are popular with the public. That's all. You hear that, inspector? Madam, I'm not an inspector. The Larry Gordon, crime specialist. I don't care what you say. He's the man to solve this mystery for us. Madam, we're dealing with fact not fiction. I'm begging your pardon, too. You go ahead, officer. You see how altruistic he is? During the time you searched the coach, you saw no signs of the bogus ticket collector? None whatsoever. Unless. Unless what? It's purely supposition. But how do I know I didn't see him? Wouldn't take two seconds to get rid of a coat through a window. Yes, I made up my mind about that. He must still be in the coach. Blake's not on the train. Right, lock that door and fetch the remainder of the passengers from the forward coach. Don't prepare them for anything. I want genuine reactions when they come in. Wouldn't feel too happy, Harding. Night show isn't going to help you anyway. Oh you can sneer but whoever's helping you has got to get rid of me as well and I swear I'll have you in court tomorrow morning. If any more snow falls on the line, nobody will be in court. What's all the fuss about? This is detective Tom Peterson. Do any of you know Steve Harding? I didn't expect that to work but it might've. Sargent, why talk in riddles? I'm sure that most of us have heard of Steve Harding. Isn't that him? Tonight, not more than one hour ago, the ticket collector on this train was attacked and his tunic stolen. Someone wore the stolen tunic, locked that door leading to the main part of the train, and then entered the coach you've just left. He was seen speaking to my assistant, detective constable Blake, who has since disappeared. I believe Blake was pushed off the train. That's terrible. That's not all. Whoever dispensed with Blake must get rid of me if they want to free Harding. Sargent, there's one thing that puzzles me. Yes? After liquidating Blake, why didn't they carry through with their plan and get rid of you? Perhaps you and miss Owens just stopped them. Don't forget that Blake hadn't got a gun but I have and I warn you now if any attempt is made to release Harding I shall use it. Inspector, you don't mean to say that one of us has killed Blake. There she goes again. Yes, madam. I have statements from the others in here, so perhaps if you'll be so kind for one small plight. I take it you have no objections if I ask the guard to search you. I certainly have. Good. Go ahead. You first, miss. Name, address, occupation. Helen Mason, missus. Four hambry court. Occupation model. What's the destination? Adventure in cockland. I'm on holiday. How far along in coach was your compartment? Second or third. The second I think. You two travelling together? I joined the train in pickering. Your name, sir. Elliot foster. Do you mind telling me where you're going? Stanton. You'll be changing at the junction. Yes I believe so. Why are you going there? I'd rather not say. You realise I can't force you to tell me, but it might be better if you do. I'm sorry, sargent. Very good, sir. Just one more question. Did either of you leave your compartment during the last hour? No. I don't suppose you saw the bogus ticket collector pass your compartment? Thank you. Hey sargent, I don't what the guard expected to find on me. I like a few particulars about yourself. They're all there. Edward hooker, broker. 34 Milton chambers. Are you changing at the junction? Yes. I thought I'd like to see a murder trial. How far along in coach was your compartment? Third, just past the lady. Thank you, guard. I've searched the best I could. Good. Did you see or anything unusual tonight? I slept most of the way. That'll be all. You mind standing over here? Boy, what a lot of men. See what you mean. I think he's quite disgusting. I'm bud Benson, engineer. Address? Leyland hotel, London. We met before. I don't think so. Maybe you're right. Are you going to the trial? Why should 1? No special reason. If you gotta know, I'm going to Mansfield on business. Thank you, sir. You didn't hear anything tonight, did you? With him snoring away. Well if there's nothing else, I'll be getting back to my seat. I'm afraid you can't do that, sir. What does that mean? No one leaves this guard's Van until we get to the junction. I take it we're all under arrest. Technically yes. One of you got rid of Blake. Perhaps murdered is a better word. I want that person and I also want Harding safely in court tomorrow morning. Well you all heard what he said. The junction it is. Yes, but if we miss the connection, that means tomorrow before there's another train. Well that doesn't affect us. It does affect me and I mean to give this inefficient policeman a piece of my mind. Poor sargent. You said just now it doesn't matter to you if you miss your connection. Well we're hoping mister Pierce, that's our producer, will turn up with some money. Isn't show business rather precarious? In good weather it's precarious. In this weather it's just plain daft. I still demand to know why I should not be allowed to continue my journey without interference. I've been trying to tell you, madam. It's for your own protection. Protection? You think I need protection? Yes. No, madam. I warn you, inspector. I shall make a point to writing to commissioner about all this. I'm sure the commissioner would like that. Well. What will happen to our personal luggage? That will be placed in the cloak room at the junction until examined by the local authorities. Snow's getting worse. What time do we make the junction? Any time now. Listen please. We're puling into the junction. I didn't tell you what'll happen if anyone tries to interfere with the prisoner. After you see to the baggage, I want the coach sealed off until the police have examined it at Mansfield. Give them this. All right Harding. What's this? Sir, the detective has brought his prisoner to Stanton. 1 don't think I like a prisoner in my station. Why didn't he go for road? There was a block. Well they can get them unblocked and get 'em out of here as soon they like. Luggage to unload. Come Bailey. I'm personally happy for the guardsman. Think he may have something there. This place is damp. We should all catch our death or cold. Cobwebs. Ooh what a draught. How 'bout a plan, have you? I'll tell you that later. What time's the connection for Mansfield? Right about 12 in about 40 minutes. How long will it take the police to get here from the villages? 15 to 20 minutes according to the state of the roads. I wonder if that call will get through to the village. All right. That's the lot, sargent. Sorry I can't leave a man with you. Don't worry. I'm sending for some help. Best of luck. Thanks. Well things don't look so good. Why, what's happened? That was main line station. You ain't going to Stanton. Police ways not tonight. Too much snow on the road. They didn't think the Mansfield train would get this far. And as far as getting to Mansfield... Get through to the village. Ask them to send a car. That's another thing. The roads are blocked and half the telegraph wires are down. The train, can you hold it? Somehow I'm beginning to wish we stayed on that train. All right, man. Can't expect you to predict the weather. What now? Put my call through to the police. Hello, hello. Operator. Well that's dead. The line's dead. That's all we needed. Well, make yourself comfortable. Looks like an all night session. Are we expected to freeze to death? Well, there's some wood in the box for the stove. Shall I get it? I don't think so. Perhaps the station master would oblige. Come in here, take over the station and now I'm your servant. All right Harding, over in the corner. Here's the other one, mister Gordon. Under the circumstances, don't you think you might call me Larry? All right, Larry. All right, pat. My name's Mabel but you can call me mabs. I think I prefer Mabel. Do you? I've done that one, miss dawn, and the kettle's on. Thank you, Elliot. In my day it was considered proper to wait for an introduction. And if you think I didn't see that, you're very much mistaken. I'll get a sack for the other window. Fine. So now it's Elliot. I thought you liked the bruiser. Benson's all right but Elliot's different. He's sweet. I guess it must be the mother in me. Well there's your fire. Gee thanks. How far is it to the village? Oh about 10 miles but if you're thinking of walking, I'd give up the idea. There's nothing but mores around here. You know this is not the first time we've been snowed under. Why two winters ago Joe rawlins that was mighty leaf, he tried to get to the village on a night like this. They found him next morning face down in the snow. Not more than half a mile from here. Heard what he said, Harding? No one can get out and no one can get in. Makes my job a little easier. You're not the chummiest of people to be chained to all night. You know, we're practically in the same boat. Well someone in this room wants my life and the state wants yours. Oh, I was forgetting. The papers said you talked to save your neck? Is that right? I don't suppose you care to talk now. Might help you. Was it hooker or Benson who did the job on the train? Never mind, we'll find out. Thanks, miss. I wouldn't come any closer. He looks harmless enough. Quite. Put his cup on the floor. No funny business, Harding. I can fire this quicker than you can go throw the tea. Not a nice person? That man gives me the shivers. Thank goodness he's handcuffed. I'd say he could do with a pair. Can't help if this place frightens me. Nobody seems to be acting the part. Steady on that. It's true and you know it. Look at the cat and mouse game they're all playing. Helen Mason. She hasn't said a word since she came in. She just sits there looking at Harding. And what about hooker and Benson? They shared a compartment in the train. Why don't they sit together now? Could be that they're all afraid of each other. Don't forget that one of us is a murder suspect. Some people are sensitive, you know. I'm sure there's something between those two. Did you see that? What about him? He's nice but even he's silent and fidgety. Any comments? She thinks that kindness is a sign of weakness, but she's really rather a dear. Well, you seemed to have covered all present. All except the station master and he's downright miserable. I can't help it. There's tension in the air and you can feel it. Now that you mention it, I shouldn't be surprised if foster wasn't the neurotic killer type, waiting to get rid of the detective with a well timed bullet. Hooker and Benson are a couple of gunmen waiting to blast open an escape route for Harding and foster. As far the station master... He'll just blow a whistle for a train and whisk them all away to safety through all the snow drifts in the world. Who can laugh? I think you're right, pat. I wish I knew what was going to happen. Your sister ought to be careful with Benson. Mabel can take care of herself. He's not the type to play that kind of game. Neither is Harding. I know all about Steve Harding. Oh? You know if he's a killer, the worst type? Do you mind if we don't talk about it? Sorry. Let's talk about you and your sister. All right but Mabel isn't my sister. But the name. A stage name. We do a sister act together. Not a very good one but we get by. If I can get my hands on that producer of ours. Mister Pierce? I hope I shall recognise him when I see him. Well don't you know? Well Mabel booked the act and I've only got a description of him. What's your real name? Graham but Mabel thought that dawn had more... Appeal? Something like that. Larry. Yes? I'm scared. Stay by me tonight. I'm not that scared. What's happening to the lights? It's nothing. They'll be all right in a minute. Station master. Stay right where you are all of you. This may be a trick. I'm taking no chances. What's wrong with the lights? Should be all right. Perhaps you shut it down or turn him over. Had enough. Stay where you are. Who's there? Speak up. I'm warning you. If anyone comes near me, I'll shoot. There's somebody moving about. Who is it? Who fired? Where's Peterson? It came from inside. Well don't let him get away. After him. Get back. Stand over by the fire where I can see you. That's better. Helen, are you still there? Shut that dame up before I do it. Don't you think we ought to take a look at Peterson? Nobody moves until the others get back. I think you're crazy, Harding, trying to get away with a thing like this. Oh, it's you. Over there by the fire. You, light that one. Helen, search for his pockets for the key. Get rid of these things. Come on, come on. Make it snappy. So she was in on it after all. What kept you? We had to look. Besides, the station master's gone. Hope to fix the lights. You, get with them. Did you find the station master? Sorry, mister Harding. Benson, watch them. Hooker. Fix the light. He's gone for the police. How far's the village? 10 miles. I doubt if he'll get through. Yeah, he might make it. He knows the district. That still gives us two or three hours. Nice shooting, hooker. I didn't kill him. Well don't look at me, Steve. Oh yeah I forgot. But hooker, that's yours hooker. I got rid of mine on the train. Don't tell me I've got you to thank. No, Stevie. I wonder why you came back tonight. Don't you know? Steve, well are we making a move? Yeah, get the cases. You're not going out in this. Any ideas about trying to stop me? Just a chance that you might not make it. If the old man can make it, so can I. If not, I'll be back. Make sense? Haven't got a lot to lose one way or the other. Strange that your benefactor should remain silent. What do you mean? Somebody shot Peterson. Sir, somebody did me a good turn. Why? I don't care. That's their worry. Are you sure you don't want to find out who tried to kill you? You're pretty smart, aren't you? You're trying to keep me here 'til the old man comes back with the police. If you care to wait, I'll prove to you that Peterson was shot by mistake. If I come back, I'l take you up on that. You'll be back, Harding. Tell Gordon my name. Mister Harding. Come here. Nobody calls me Harding. Do you think they'll come back? They'll have to. It's getting worse out there. They won't get far with a woman. But if they can't keep going, they'll dump her. On the contrary, she'll be the excuse for turning back. Harding wants to return. He has to. Take miss Owens over to the fire. Give her some tea. What about Peterson? You and your sister have been so kind to me. I do owe you both an apology. Now don't you worry. They've gone and good riddance to them. I hope you're right. Well of course I'm right. Mabel will soon have a cup of tea ready. Now you must try and get some rest. Phone's wrecked. What's the answer, Larry? I don't know. Foster or I could try and make the village. That means leaving one man and three defenceless women here for Harding and his gang. If I thought for a second that foster would make it, I'd send him and try to hide the rest of us in the art buildings. He'd soon find us. Yeah, I know. Our only hope's the station master. If Harding comes back, we must try and keep him here til the police arrive. But how? One way is force. But he'll kill you. Somehow I don't think he will. There are two of us and three of them. Only one of them has a gun. Do you want to take a chance if they come back? What's your plan? We'll try and jump them as they come in that door. Mustn't give Harding time to use his gun. We'll stand more chance if the lights were out. No. No, Harding's too clever. He knows we can't leave this place with the ladies. If he saw the place in darkness, he'd suspect a trap. You girls and miss Owens can help if you will. Tell me what to do, mister Gordon. If we hear them coming back, I want you three to keep talking. Say anything. They mustn't suspect. I'll watch the door. Remember, I take Benson. You can have him. Thanks. I can hear something. I think it's them. Larry. Be careful. Mister Gordon. That wasn't the only show. You should've seen the one in London. We had eight minutes for our act. Must've been very carousel like. Like Romeo and Juliet. Arise dear son cue me in. You underestimated me, mister Gordon. I ought to kill you for this. Leave him alone, Benson. You made an enemy. You better be careful. You, you the blond one. Make some fresh tea. Now next time you try a crazy trick like that, you had it. Why you... All right sit down. She knows you're a hero. Benson, watch the door. Hooker, keep an eye on the ladies. And you mister Gordon, you're gonna answer a few questions. You knew I couldn't get far out there. What stopped you? Was that your real reason for coming back? Could be. What kind of stuff do you write? Detective stories. You're going for that deep mack? Psycho units. Impact on criminal investigations. Yeah. No, just straight detective stories with the accent on toughness. How good are you? I get by. Okay, so you're a good writer. Are you a good detective? You mean Peterson's murder? Stop stalling, Gordon. You know what I'm getting at. You think Peterson got it tonight in mistake for me. I think you're a liar. I think you're trying to keep me here til the old man arrives with the cops. I think it's a trick. I didn't ask you to come back, but shall I tell you why you did? You're scared, mister Harding. Go on. You're scared of the truth. You want to believe that Peterson, like Blake on the train, was killed by one of your friends trying to help you escape. That's how it was. Take a look of your friends, mister Harding. Hooker, Benson and the lady deny killing Peterson. Why? You tell me. Could be that their innocent. Then that leaves the old dame, the girls, foster, and you. I don't think any of us wanted to help you escape. But where's the motive for killing you? Stop playing, Gordon. If it wasn't hooker or Benson or Helen and it's not of you, then who the heck is it? I think that's for you to say. What are you getting at? When you were arrested, you told the papers that you were going to talk in court. From that moment you were a dead man. You had to be silenced. That's why Peterson died tonight. The murderer made a mistake. He thought he'd shot you. I don't believe it. Don't you? I think you do. That's why you came back tonight. You wanted to run away but you knew you'd never be safe. You had to be certain. You're right, mister Gordon. Right, right. Who was it, Benson? Tell me. Honest, Steve, I don't know. Honest. You're lying, you wretch. Tell me or I'll mock you for life. Lay off him, Steve. You're wasting your time. This won't get you anywhere. Maybe you can tell me. Was it you, Helen? You know better than that. I don't know anything anymore. We finished two years ago. Why did you come back tonight? Why did you come back? You gotta tell me. Do you hear? I loved you once, Steve. Remember? You're not getting very far. You're right again, mister Gordon. And you know what? You're gonna find the murderer for me. Sorry mister Harding. I'm throwing it right back at you. It's worth a thousand. Don't do it. If I find the murderer, what happens to him? That's my affair. A bullet in the stomach, huh? Sorry. Okay. You had your chance. Get behind the counter. Go on. Take off your coat. Changed your mind? Think you can take him? It's a pleasure, Steve. Don't forget he's got to work afterwards. Please, mister Harding. Oh the poor boy. Stop him someone. He'll kill him. Maybe you wanna change places with him. What are you waiting for? Hold it, Benson. It's up to you, Gordon. Mister Harding, stop it. Stay out of this, pat. No. Maybe she's right. Perhaps you have had enough. Benson, take her into the office. You know what to do. All right, Harding. You win. I'm awfully sorry, Larry. I just couldn't stand it any longer. That's all right. If it hadn't been you, it would've been somebody else. How'd you feel, mister Gordon? How would you feel after being hit by a steamroller? You haven't much time. You mean the station master? I wouldn't count on him getting through. Well maybe so. Suppose I don't find the killer? You will. Won't he? All right. Where do we start? That's up to you but don't forget, I've got the gun. If you want me to help you, I have to know all about your activities. That's out. Sorry. Unless I know the facts... All right, all right. What do you wanna know? The name of the man you'll hang if you talk. Stanley Mason. Is he your boss? We work together. Did he ever kill anybody? I told you we work together. That doesn't answer my question. Sure, sure, Mason killed. He killed a girl on the last job we did but he got clear. How long have you been together? Nine, 10 years. We split up two years ago. But you said he did the last job with you. He couldn't handle it himself. He wanted me on it with him. It was a nice, easy set up 'til Mason caught old man Martin's daughter on the telephone. He couldn't use a gun. It was too noisy. So he knifed her and he ran. Police found me with the girl. You think Mason tried to frame you? Why should he? Then tell me why you split up two years ago. You might know the answer to that. Is she the reason? Keep her out of this. Was she? I don't know. Things were getting too hot. We just decided to split up. Mason took his boys. I took mine. What happened to you, missus Mason, after your husband and mister Harding split up? I stayed with Steve for awhile. Then what? Did you go back to your husband? What'd you take me for? I haven't seen him for two years. Is Benson one of your men? Yeah. And hooker? I don't know. Now wait a minute, mister Harding. I've always worked for you. And Mason, eh hooker? You never could make up your mind, could you? Well if anybody says that, they're a liar. I'm saying it. But for what reason? I've always looked after your interests. Tell me. Whose interests were you looking after the night that Mason killed the Martin girl? I don't think I understand you, mister Gordon. I think you do. Let me put it another way. Who were you working for that night? Mister Harding of course. That's right. Why didn't the police pick you up when they arrived? He was on the outside. Yeah, I was in the car. When I saw the police arriving, I signalled with the horn. You cut it very fine. How was that Mason got away? How would I know? I told you he cleared as soon as he killed the girl. Where was Benson? He had the second car on the next street in case the police blocked the road. Just one other thing. Why were you on the train tonight? I don't like policeman. Is that the only reason you're here? Yeah. I think you're lying. Do you know why I know you're lying? You're frightened. Why? Why should you be frightened? You're among friends. In fact your anybody's friend who cares to pay you. How much did Mason pay you to let the police car through before warning Harding? If you double crossed me, you little worm. No, no, mister Gordon. You don't know what you're saying. You're making it bad for me with mister Harding. It's one of two reasons. Now listen, I've already told you the truth. You were frightened that your name might come up in court. Benson's plan to rescue him gave you the opportunity to find out what Harding was up to in court. It'd also put you in right with him. What's the other reason? Mason would pay pretty highly for news of your death. You can't believe him. I got rid of Blake for you. Oh now take it easy, Steve. Don't know what you're doing. Stop him. Stop him. He'll kill me. How much were you paid? I've never seen Mason. I'll give you three seconds. How much were you paid? All right, all right, I'll tell you. Mason did pay me. I had to take it. He had me cornered. There's the money. Take it. I was gonna give it to you, Steve. Where's your gun? It's like I said. I got rid of it on the train. Benson saw me. There was a corridor window. You can live. You can go back to Mason. He won't like it either when he knows you double crossed him. Lies. Only lies. Everybody telling me lies. You. You wouldn't tell Peterson why you were going to Stanton. You're gonna tell me now. I'd rather not say. I was going to Branson prison. My brother's serving a sentence there. So our silent little hero has a brother in jail. You leave him alone. Where are you going? Going to get some wood. Maybe you know something. If I knew anything, I'd keep it to myself. Careful, pat. Careful, pat. Even if we do find the murderer, he won't let us go. We know too much for his own safety. Take it easy. No, no, let her go on. I've heard a lot of stories about you, but I thought people were being unfair. That was until I met Mason and you. Oh you won't remember. It was one night after the show. I introduced you to the girl in my act. No, not Mabel. Her name was Joan Warren. No, you won't remember it. It was over three years ago. You made her drunk. She jumped from her bedroom window. She jumped five stories. That was on her 18th birthday. You liked her a lot, eh? We went to school together. Did you like her well enough to try to kill me? I felt sorry for you at first. I thought it might have been an accident. But now? But now, if I had the chance, I'd kill you. Steve. What's the matter? What's happened? Station master. Has he brought the police with him? He's outside in the snow drift dead as a door nail. You sure he's dead? Would it do with his head smashed in? Okay get the wood. You want me to go over again? I said get the wood. It doesn't look as if your station master made it after all. How could you just stand there like that? Another man's been murdered and all you can say is get the wood. Why should I freeze to death just because there's a dead man out there? So the police won't be coming, mister Gordon. They'll be here. You sure? Listen. If anyone wants to play hero, forget it. Just to take your places as though nothing's happened. You, get on with your knitting. You, booker. I don't trust you. Get over to that seat. Foster or whatever your name is, cover up that bandage with your coat. Don't forget all of you. I'll be watching every move that you make. Whoever it is, get rid of them quickly. I'll blast the first one who tries any tricks. My car got stuck in the snow. Well I'm sorry. Far away? Only a few miles but the snow makes walking difficult. Might've been better for you had you gone on to the village. I thought the station was nearer. I'd like to use the telephone. Is the station master in? No, no, he's out. Doubt that he'd mind if I use his telephone. I'm afraid it's no good. The line's down. It's not working. In that case it's not much point in my using the telephone. I'm not interrupting anything, am 1? No, no, of course not. Good. Is that tea? Yes. Would it be very rude of me to ask for a cup? It's viscerally cold outside. The tea's all gone. I'm afraid you've made a mistake. I'm sure we can find you a cup. Harding's not going to like this. I don't care what he likes. I'm not letting a poor man go out without some tea. Larry. Yes? Any chance of slipping him a message? By the time he got to the village and back. Careful with that. Benson's watching us. Thank you for the cup of tea. If I'm to make the village, I'd better push off. It's a long way from here. Wouldn't you like another cup of tea? You heard what he said. He's a long way to go. Yes, perhaps I'd better push off. I know you. Beg your pardon. Over there. Who is it? Mason? No. But I'm gonna find out. I met that guy before. Oh you can't do that. Lady, I'm doing it. Steve Harding. You hear that, Gordon? He knows me. Who are you? So you've got my gun. And that's all you will get. Don't be too sure. You've still got your life, eh Benson. Now you're going to tell me everything I want to know. You can tell me here where it's nice and peaceful or you can tell me in the office where it's likely to be rough. I have nothing to say. Okay Benson. Let me try. Tonight a police sargent was killed in this room. Outside in the snow is the body of a station master. We want to find out who is responsible. These men have a special reason to knowing. If you don't speak, Benson will take you in there. He'll show you no mercy. He'll use you as a punch bag until you beg to be allowed to speak. These men are killers. If you've nothing to fear, tell them. If you have, well tell them anyway. You'll find out. I promise you that. Thank you for trying to be so helpful. It's too late now. Your time's up. Okay Benson. For your own good, tell them what they want to know. Think of your family. What will it mean to them. I have no family. Please. I wonder what she would have wanted. All right Harding. Make it quick. I'm John Martin. Of course, now I know. You should know. You're standing trial tomorrow for killing my daughter. So what? I made up my mind to kill you in case you escape the death penalty by talking. I tried to kill you but somebody got there before me. Was that earlier tonight? Yes, I was on your train. I cut telephone wires. I turned off the gas. I came in here. Before I could shoot though, other shots. I panicked and ran away. Why did you come back here? Don't know. I walked and walked. I had to know what had happened. What made you faint? I hadn't eaten all day and out walking the snow. You're lying, Martin. You fainted 'cause you had a shock. You found that I was still alive. You shot at me but mister Peterson got it. And the station master found you running away, so you had to fix him, too. How's that, mister Gordon? Why should mister Martin endanger his life by coming back here? He's already told you. He had to make sure that I was dead. Too much to expect you'd believe me. You don't think I shot him, do you? Of course I don't but he's got to blame somebody, so the great Steve Harding turns on an old man. Shut her up, Gordon. She's right. Martin isn't guilty and you know it. Can you prove it? We must've overlooked something. That's your worry. Come on, on your feet you. You're going for a walk. You're not going to shoot him in cold blood. Anybody wanna go along, just say so. Steve, the cops. Stay where you are, everybody. It's your move. If you think I'm beaten, you're crazy. Martin, over by the fire. Be sensible. The odds are too great. If you do shoot your way out, then what? They're coming. I'm not gonna shoot my way out. You're gonna get rid of them for me. You can tell them anything you like but get rid of them. And remember, one word and she gets it fast. All right Harding. I'll play. Quick. Watch him, Benson. Don't be alarmed. I'm detective inspector Clarke. I want to see sargent Peterson. He's not here, inspector. That's funny. You were the people on the Mansfield train tonight? Oh yes. The guard reported that sargent Peterson would be taking the prisoner onto Stanton station. I checked but the train was cancelled. That's why I'm here. If there wasn't a train, how did sargent Peterson leave here? By car, inspector. Well the roads are blocked. You managed to get through. I told them but we had to walk most of the way. Mister Barrett was kind enough to guide us. Who took sargent Peterson out? The station master. That was after Blake telephoned. Blake? I thought he was missing from the train. Yes, he was. He had an accident but he's all right now. Well that's fine. I must let my station know. They'll be relieved. The phone's dead. Well that's a pity. Hello, this lock's been broken. Yes, the prisoner tried to make a dash for it, but sargent Peterson was too quick for him. Peterson had a busy night. What's the matter with him? He hasn't been well. If any of you wanna go back with us, the car's not more than five miles down the road. Now perhaps everyone would be wise, I was forgetting the ladies. Well, I think that's all, sir. And thank you for your help. Make sure they're gone. Thank you, mister Gordon. You don't think he lied to save you. They're gone, Steve. What about his nubs? Better give them time to get clear. This is it, Martin. Come on. You're making a mistake. You've had your chance. Mister Martin, think. Isn't there anything that might help you? Think, man, think. It's no use. I didn't kill either of them. The station master was... What about him? Small point but when I was running away, I looked back and saw him talking to someone. Someone from this room? I think so. Well take a look, man. Quick. It's no good. I must be mistaken. I'll say you were. You nearly had me fooled. This won't take long. He said it was someone from this room. Yes, but why should he say that? He said it was someone from this. Pat. I didn't mean to kill him or the station master. I was after Harding. Well I arrived with. With who? Later. We must stop Harding. What's going on? Look out, Benson. I'm coming through. Larry. You still wanna go out? Cover the window. They're back. I had to run for it. Martin? Saved by cops. Harding, this is inspector Clarke. You're surrounded. Come and get me. You'll never get away with this. You've got five minutes to think it over. How's their thing over there? We can't say. We have to run for it. You'll never make it. You gotta take me with you. Benson, open the back door. They can come back. You better take me with you I tell you. What do you want? What do you think? We're getting out of here. They'll shoot you down. Hey you, you wanna get out? Here's your chance. Come here. What do you mean? It's all yours outside. You can't send me out there. They'll pick me off. That's your lookout. I want go I tell ya. You can take it in the back or you can take your chance outside. Get him out of here. Come on the back way. We'll go along the line. Don't move far. Stop. Come on. Hold it, Steve. Helen. Don't move, Steve. So that's it then? Yes, that's it. Elliot missed you tonight but I shan't. I'm going to kill you but first I want mister Gordon to know why I'm killing such a rat. When you threw me out two years ago, Mason took me back. You didn't know that, did you Steve? Mason played straight with me and I'm not gonna sing ham for you. Your time's up, Harding. Elliot. Keep him covered. Don't let my sister get away. Your sister? Yes. I knew Helen was out to get Harding. I tried to stop her. All my life she's got me out of trouble. I saw a chance to repay her. I couldn't let her stick her neck out. Boy Helen, I even bungled things by shooting Peterson. What about the station master? He saw me throw away the gun. I had to silence him. I'm sorry. Harding. Well, then the police came back and I'm afraid that Helen. Oh. And that dear lady is how I would write a story about a train and its passengers. Thank you. That poor boy foster. What a shame he had to be a killer. Harding was horrible. He deserved to die. Oh but mister Gordon, you forgot to explain one thing. Why did the police return? Well that's easy. I passed the handcuffs to Clarke when I shook hands with him. Well that was very clever. Well goodbye, miss Owens. Goodbye. Pardon me, madam. Do you mind if I smoke? Not at all. Thank you. You're. Guard. Guard. Oh no. Mister Gordon. Mister Gordon.
