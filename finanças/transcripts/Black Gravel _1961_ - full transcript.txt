THE EVENTS AND CHARACTERS OF THE STORY ARE FICTIONAL. THE LOCATION AND TIME ARE NOT. SOHNEN IS ONE OF THE AIR BASES IN THE PALATINATE. AROUND 6000 US AIR FORCE MEN LIVE HERE IN THE BARRACKS AND ESTATES, AS DO AROUND 3000 FAMILY MEMBERS AND CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES. THE VILLAGE OF SOHNEN HAD AROUND 261 INHABITANTS BEFORE ITS ONLY STREET ENDED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE AIR BASE. TODAY THERE ARE ALMOST TWICE AS MANY. MOST ARE WOMEN. THE NUMBER OF BARS AND CLUBS HAS RISEN TO ELEVEN. SOHNEN AIR BASE IS PRIMARILY A TRAINING SITE FOR JET PILOTS AND GROUND PERSONNEL. IT IS CURRENTLY (EARLY OCTOBER, 1960) BEING EXTENDED SO AS TO ALSO SERVE AS A ROCKET BASE. Hey, move on! Why don't you drive on? Come on! Come here! Come on, get lost why don't you? Run the mutt down if it won't move. You'll need bigger shots. You made a fine job of that. Ah, kiss my ass. Don't throw your weight about, Yank! Those days are over! Give me the delivery cards. You each get two extra US stamps for two trucks. Unload them this evening. - At Preschel's? - Yes. At around 8:00. What's all this? A FILM BY HELMUT KAUTNER BLACK GRAVEL WRITTEN BY HELMUT KAUTNER, WALTER ULBRICH DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY HEINZ PEHLKE SOUND HEINZ GARBOWSKI EDITOR AND ASSISTANT DIRECTOR KLAUS DUDENHGFER SET GABRIEL PELLON FEATURING RECORDING DIRECTOR KARL GILLMORE CAMERA WOLFGANG TREU CAMERA ASSISTANT BERN HARD HELLMUND EDITING ASSISTANT IRIS ROESL PRODUCTION MANAGER HAJO WIELAND - I can't find the fault. - Should I look? - If you would. - It's hardly modern. Press this as I turn it over. Hello. No contact. Nothing. It'll be the distributor head. It's hard to get at. - I can tow it for ten dollars. - Ten? Those are the prices here. It's not our fault. - You got a rope? - Yes. It's after nine. We were due at 08:30. You had to look for the dog. Tub won't come home alone. He only got here yesterday. Tub, Tub, Tub! We need the connections, darling. We're strangers. The Commander's invited all the base's elite. - John, you could go alone. - How would that look? I can't just go there without my wife. Imagine the gossip. - Tub will come home. - Not alone. He's a stranger like us. There's nothing to be done. I'll get someone from Sohnen to tow you, Major. - Can I drive over with you? - Sure. You go to the Harolds. I'll call a garage from there and then look for the dog. It's nylon at that. Evening. That's just Elli. Move over. She's sloshed. Sleep on, love. - Hi. - Good evening. - Evening, Inge. - Evening, Robert. I didn't recognize you at first. - I recognized you at once. - Weird coincidence, huh? I thought you were AWOL. Or I'd have had news from you over the years. You're not AWOL, but I had no news, either. How would you? I still don't know where you went. No. You don't look too happy about our reunion. But I'm delighted. Really. Even though I should be sore. Elli is no bother. She never is. How do you like it, she's been in here all evening. - Charming. - Indeed. Though something's on at the Atlantic. She has no business acumen. Not even on the Yanks' payday. - How are you? What are you doing? - I'm grand. Things are moving. There's money to be made. - When did you get here? - Two days ago. - You came with the Yank? - Yes. - I can't say I like it. - You don't like John? I don't like you hanging out with Yanks. - It's not your style. - You think? Yes, I do. - But people change over time. - You don't. No, I don't. - I really don't! Funny... - Very funny. I still have your striped pullover. You forgot it back then. - Yes. - Yes. But it wouldn't fit you now. No, I'm more slender. I've lost my baby fat. That I can't judge. Not from the wrong places, I hope. - Did you argue with the Yank? - Why? - It seemed that way. - Yes? The first occupants were openhanded. Now they're tightfisted. Oh, you mean...? In America they call it Lovers' Lane. Now we have it here. For exchanging caresses at the double. There aren't enough beds in Sohnen on payday. And anyway, they cost 30 an hour. But why tell you this? You know it all. - I do? - Well, don't you? - Elli's getting fat. - Got that thing from Jimmy? - Mainly around the bottom. - From him? No. I wouldn't wear stripes now. No wonder. She always eats seconds. I got it from Georgy. They have a phone. Let her sleep. That's the joint. It was a cowshed, now it's a pigsty. They have rooms. I live here. Generally. Don't know her. Margot! Did we have an Anni Peel? Engaged to a sergeant? Bill Rodgers, by name. There was an Anni at the New Las Vegas. But she wasn't called Peel. Hey, Robert, what's up? The first truck is done. I'll unload the second tomorrow. Who was that, Loeb? A Yankee sleuth? An American Yid from Vienna. Who's he reeling in now? There's another phone on my corridor. Is there something about my joint you don't like? They look sad, the boys. Sad they are. They come over here, get homesick. What business opportunities. Elli. Today is my day off. Hi! - She'll do herself in. - Robert will do her in. Maybe it's that fabled love. Saturday night? Are you dumb? Enough. Won't do it. Can afford not to. Cashiers have taken over from craftsman. Neidhardt here. Is your father in? Why is the funfair still on? Listen up, kid. Your pa is to tow someone. A Yank. He can bill fine. Fine, but don't leave me hanging. She's getting someone. Make yourself comfortable. Everything a body needs. It's not luxurious, but well situated, with a bar for music and dance, and boudoirs next door. A brothel on your front door step. I told you I hadn't changed. It's not upside down if you're in bed. - Tasteless, huh? - Oh, yes. Right. But irresistible. I've had shots like that in my locker for 15 years. In Chervonsk it was a Russian ballerina. Hello? Hello! The funfair. No business acumen at all. Or is it not your room? I can send Elli away if you want. She won't mind. Why shouldn't we start back where you stopped? If the chemistry is right, as we'll soon see. Hello? It won't be the first time your Yank gets the push. Hello? Hello, listen. Would you kindly tow our car at once? On the road from Sohnen to Hunsrilckh√©henstrasse. My husband is with the car. Major Gaines. We live on the American Estate. Many thanks. - Know her? Is she new? - No. Must be from the estate. That's no bunny she's wearing. No, I'll walk. I might find Tub. - Tub? - My dog. He ran away. - A Dalmatian. - With spots? Yes. - I'll ask around, see what I find out. - Good night. Hi, Bob. Hello, Bob. - Getting your hands sweaty? - What terrible things you say. Envy, Anni, pure envy. Bill, been to the barber's? - When will you do the car? - Where are the 200 bucks? - It was a special deal for your banger. - The generator's shot. So is the oil sump. Tomorrow's Sunday. I'll start early, it'll be good to go by evening. Come on in. You're getting wet. - The lovers don't know where to go. - Well, Aunt Marbach is so funny. And they're even funnier at the barracks, huh, Bill? - Well, you don't want my pad. - No. You're much too decent for your figure, Miss Anni Peel. And Bill was almost a missionary. How about a stroll? When the echo sounds, the forest resounds. But it's always raining. All summer long. And a wet behind is no fun. - All right. - You're a card. They're plentiful. How about getting married? Solves every problem. He put in the papers three months ago. It takes so long to get permission. I'm from Rostock, the GDR. - Not even on the run. - My word. - You're visiting? - Uh-huh. - At her Aunt Marbach's. - And got caught. By this one here. - Yes. - Then wedding permission will take time. Shitty politics. - Smart. - Sweet, huh? It's Japanese. A transistor. With VHF. He gave it to me. - She's so happy with it. - With him. - With you. - You're nice kids. Take care, be good. Another double. That thing with the damn mutt got to my heart. Oh? I thought it got to your nose. - Any mail? - Just a postcard. With the Brandenburg Gate on it. From my mother. - Where's Krahne? - He went up earlier. - Krahne? With which of you? - No, he wanted to see you. Oops! - Funny,huh? - Cohn in a vest in the wardrobe! That's really good. - What are you doing here? - Mr. Krahne was telling me jokes. Listen. Cohn is in bed with Mrs. Blau, and as they're... - I know it. It's bad. - I don't think so. I wanted to square things with you. Should we go to mine? - Elli won't be a bother. She's clued-in. - Ah. What's the hurry? Today with Preschel was my last time. I'm through here. I'm off. To Canada. I've laid you out all that has come in. Bills for cements, gravel, this is the iron that went to Frankfurt. Why Canada? To hug trees? My brother works with wood. I want to get in on it. Why that? My God, I've already lost all my savings twice. Once to inflation. My father hanged himself from the window frame. - Then it started over. - I know the tale. Unemployed, recruited, a PG then a POW, a Madeira-sailor, a Russian returnee, a VW-saver, a fellow traveler. Yes. And for nothing. But it won't happen to me a third time. My ship sails from Southampton in a week. I have all the tickets, immigration papers, the lot. - And not a word about it. How perfidious. - Lord, it suddenly just came about. What are you afraid of, the police? - Not them. - What else? - That bombs start hailing down again? - That's right! Every day I see what they make here. Not only here. No one can tell me it's all for defense. That's old hat. As is all this talk of peace. So what? Otto, who gives a shit where he gets struck down? - Is Canada safe from the bomb? - You're like that. You care about nothing. - But always broke, huh? - Yet not dumb. I've been a soldier, a prisoner, a survivor. I only started living recently. But at least I am alive, you tightwad. Come off it. Call that a life? In that hovel. By day it's dust and gravel and dirt, by night it's boozing and whor... Give me a break. Always this disorder and insecurity, always one foot in jail. You're nuts. Who'll give us the US stamps for the delivery cards when you go? I thought you would talk to Bill. You're so tight with him. Bill won't do it. He's too proper. - And he's fine. Who'll do your job? - I don't care. You're a washout, Krahne. I think this takes care of things. It dates back to May, when Bill got here. Cement bill, gravel bill, Preschel's, Stoltenkamp & Co, the farmer from Ramstein, Preschel again, etc. You get, all told, 2418 marks. Put it there and split. You get my goat. - Good night, Miss Elli. - She's sleeping. Otto, you know what you are? A cowardly asshole. Send me a postcard from Canada. Inge? Robert, what is this? - What do you think? - John's here. Tell him it's about the dog. - Who's that, Harold? - Someone's found Tub. They steal animals then demand a ransom. - He hung up. - Gangsters. - Don't agree to anything if he calls back. - No. No. Hurry up. Or I'll really fall asleep. You could just as well have said we'd had a breakdown. I always get the... - Sorry. - But you don't feel well, right? John, let's leave this place. Let's go to Libertyville. You promised we would. But, darling, I can't just give up my job here. Maybe we can do it next year. - Or in two years. - Or in five years. You were never in a hurry to get to the States. Why now? All right, all right. It was just a request. - Sorry? - Nothing. - Chopin. - I know the piece. I have Ray Coniff's version. But it's fine as just an instrumental. Tomorrow is Sunday. Into the valley Greetings to you, my quiet valley I went for many an hour Down into the valley - Why are you here? - Twelve kilometers away, in Hahneschied. Someone found a Dalmatian yesterday. It just came up to him. - I thought I'd drop by. - Is it Tub? That we will find out. I know the man. He wants money. I'd better come in. - It doesn't look good like this. - I'll get the door. Are we still paying occupation fees? - What does the man want? - What man? - So it was all lies. - You'd have let me in otherwise? Your husband is at church, right? Sure, he's a churchgoing type. - What if he's not? - I'm owed ten dollars for the tow. It wasn't my rope that tore. That's reason enough. I don't want to see you anymore. Don't you get it? I never will. Hah! Beds like in the US with a gap between. Very unpractical. - Would you please leave? - I can help you unpack. What's the English for "conventional"? That's how I find all this. Is this a life for you? Mondays bridge, Tuesdays charity, Wednesdays bowling, Thursdays at the Johnsons, Fridays at the cinema, Saturdays sex life, and Sundays church and party. There. Buying clip-on frames. I know it all from Lana. Excuse me, from Mrs. Patterson... who couldn't even push beds together, but found out fast. She lives over there. Second floor. The apartment's identical. Or was that in Bitburg? Even from the window you can't tell where you are. Remember the view from my place in Heidelberg? The rotten roof with the lilac, the chimney in front of the lithographer's. I still have the banjo that hung next to the window. Why did you leave so abruptly? Without a word or an address? - You can talk to me. - It's none of your business. Everything was right between us, Inge. Take your hands off. It doesn't get me hot now. You forgot it all? Your little office on Schwetzinger street? Mr. Nichols from the press center. My first motorbike. Riding to Neckar-Sulz, you on the back. - My skirt over my head in fear. - And only panties beneath it. Jumping naked into the Neckar river. "White fish by the moon." You said that. Yes. And then forgot it. I know now it was a terrible time. So sketchy and unsure. I never knew when, or where you'd come from, if at all, after your black-marketing. Everyone was at it. You had to make a living. And it saw us through, Inge. I'm still at it. I'm driving black gravel tonight. It's all money. Would you please leave? - Tell me, first. - No. I can imagine, anyway. A Yank came by. Maybe it was even Nichols with his fangs. When he returned to his family, the next one arrived, and he passed on the tip as you went downhill fast. Finally one got stuck. No wonder. A puritan who'd never seen a woman like you. He had to pay with a wedding ring. You're wildly off. No one came by. I went to Frankfurt alone. No one came for ages. Then Gaines did. And married me at once. - Even before Burma. - Burma? We went everywhere. Ankara, Morocco, Sicily. To all the rocket bases he works on. Look at that. The new boss. Just don't mention black gravel to him. Like it or not, I'm glad to be with John. He's pleasant. He's decent and he's very good to me. What they call barter, huh? You sleep with him for security. It's Krahne's style. And what did you give me? - Love? - Did I ever lie to you? No. You always said there is no love. Love is just a fairy tale they tell us to keep us stupid. You said that. I believed that back then. Now I know better. It's shocking what's become of you. A real... I'm happy. That's what became of me. And I have a home. And that's lovely. John's waiting for me. I have to get changed. Get changed. It never used to bother you, my presence. Quite the contrary. Here are the ten dollars. For the tow. Thank you, good lady. Every little shit helps. Can you translate for me? Only the essentials. - I can do so, Bob. - You? Good morning. He's talking about Christopher Columbus. His day is on the 12th. It wasn't India he discovered. It was the New World. And today we send rockets high up... Satellite/v. With monkeys and dogs. Do we always find what we expect? We only ever discover God's... God's mysterious ways. What is progress? Nothing but a new fa... facet of the eye of God reflecting the eternal light. And if we head forth to search for Him, we find Him, and us... we find in Him. Every day can be your Columbus Day. Let us search for the Lord, and us in Him. Chance would be a fine thing. Believe it now? At 4:00 I meet the guy who has the dog. It'd be better you came along. I've written down the address. It's on the back. With directions. It's 12 kilometers. Towards Mosel. Morning. - I hope the tow worked out. - Yes, thanks. I'm still owed ten dollars. I told your wife. She happened to be beside me. But she didn't have change. There's no hurry. But people do forget. Not always maliciously. - Here. - Thank you, sir. Practical, huh? The Protestants are done, it turns, now come the Catholics. Have to work on the football field for the German employees. TO HAHNESCHIED I can't see a number, but it must be here. The sign's over there. - Need a receipt? - No, thanks. I'll be going back at once. Hello? Is anyone there? I was already here. I just went out for this. Nutcake. Not Heidelberg quality, though. Pity you're so punctual. I'd have loved to see your face. The mad ideas people have, huh? But the unemployed did such things then. Come in. Where's Tub? The guy's trying to up the price by keeping us waiting. - You live here. - You worked it out. Yes, I'm the nutcase. Back when I was released, I used a little trick to wind up here. And I built all this rubbish. Did I never tell you? I only did it to have something to do. I was at a loose end. I really ran it as a going concern. For the Yanks. On Sundays. For Camels. With jokes. In English. You have Tub. You kidnapped him. Stop right there. All right, there is no man. - But I didn't steal the dog. No one did. - Where did you get the collar? The dog's done. Someone did him in on the site when he got underfoot. Not me. I tried to save him. He's beneath the roadbed. Section 19, south. The ramp. Under three meters of gravel. It happened just before we got off yesterday. Now you know the facts. - Sorry, but that's how it is. - Typical. Cold-hearted and opportunistic. What else could I do after this morning? You came for the dog. You wouldn't have for me. No. But thanks for being honest for once. I often am. But no one wants to hear it. It hasn't been good, us meeting again. Not for you, either. There's our banjo. I'll have to have it fixed, now Dixieland is back in. I'll fetch water. Yes, you looked like that once. Wait, I have something else. Here it is. It's still in good shape. Imagine how many mothballs it took over the years. The water's almost boiling. It's pretty cozy here, huh? You wouldn't believe how quiet the nights are. The odd pine cone falls on the roof, but that's all. I never bring people here. Hardly anyone knows I have this place. Inge... who would know here? You'd have to bring the car in, but that's all. No one comes here. There'll be no disorder created, no loss of security... or of marriage. Inge. Security. You told me this morning it's barter with John. Yes. Perhaps you're right. But I don't pay with love, you know that. I have to... I loathe these big words. I must at least try to behave decently. Please, Robert, stay away from me. It's just coincidence that our paths crossed again. Is everything to be broken by that? Robert... Robert, please help me. I'm not that strong. I sent the taxi away, too. NO! No! I can drive you home. I still have the collar in the cabin. Take it and show it. An alibi for Mr. Gaines. The lady forgot two thermoses and her case. Well, that takes care of that, then. For Christ's sake, the boys give up a Sunday to help the Germans coat their field and no Germans come. They won't come. Despite the overtime. - They earn too well. - It's the upswing. Papa can't make them. Not on Sunday. And the union's grumbling. Mr. Wiechers, the building company's junior boss. Mrs. Gaines. Hello. Here's the tea, John. - What an unpleasant sun. - It's beating down. - Will you have tea, Mr. Wiechers? - Gladly. There's more bad news. Material's been vanishing for months. The special gravel we get from Aschau, in particular. It's black-marketed to small firms here. Like in Morocco. We get milked by everyone. I tipped off the police. They'll be at Preschel's yard tonight. Gravel is siphoned off there on Sundays. In the dark. No, Bill. Not here. Where else? Oh, Bill! Don't turn it off. Turn it up. - Another beer. And a schnapps. - R√∂ssler, you drink too much. It will damage your liver. That'd suit you, huh? I can drink all I want. From 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. For free. If you hadn't signed the contract! But you wanted my barn. Another beer and a schnapps. Now! My liver is none of your damn business. - What else? - One second. It's for you, Elli. Yes? No, Robert's not here. Not upstairs either, I tell you. He left with the dumper 30 minutes back. Sure, he was wearing jeans. Loud? Here? The din's on your end. What? Thank you. PRESCHEL'S CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS Kill the lights! Turn around! - The police are at Preschel's yard. - How come? Move it! Move it! That's the second. How many more, I wonder. Shit. What if they catch us both now? - Just bring the gravel back. - I can't. It's been signed out and has to vanish. I know where it'll be well hidden. - You're mad to be doing this. - I couldn't let you take a fall. Despite this afternoon? They'll be ruined otherwise. And feet can be washed. - We can flag down a car up there. - It won't stop, Anni. Not even if I do this? - But you have to hide. - I wouldn't stop. Bill! There's one coming down the forest road. Ann‚Äú.! A doctor can't help now. They are... dead. The police. There's a phone up on the avenue. You have to go. You can't be mixed up in this. The 10:21 has just gone. 10:36. Oh, but it's Sunday. There are no more. Run off. Down there. It's only two kilometers to the estate. Go on! You know nothing! You weren't here! I'll take care of all this! Inge. We're playing D-Day. Stanley told a good joke. We discovered Europe back then. Landed in Normandy. To pay Columbus back. John, Tub is dead. Run over. I've just been there. Someone called me. The name was on the collar. - What's wrong? - Why are your fog lights on? - Oh, right. - Show me your papers. What are you carrying? Carrying? On Sunday night? Are you the owner of this truck? You can see that. I can't afford a Mercedes 190 SL, too. No gravel, Willi. It's empty. Your plates are dirty, too. So are yours. It just rained. Thank you. Drive carefully. - A double schnapps and a pils. - Evening, Robert. It didn't fly. Someone snitched. The cops were at Preschel's. - What? - I dumped the lot somewhere. What about Reiss and Brockmann? - Again. - I had a beer. Where's Preschel? At the cinema. As you know. Don't drink so much. You'll get impotent. Dance instead. Negro music. - Are you mad? - Why should I be? Then hold me properly. - Neidhardt, where's Krahne? - Looking for you, I guess, Mr. Preschel. Carla! Daddy! I'll give you a beating! Bravo, Preschel! Bravo, Preschel! What's up with you? You were hot to go, then you just split. Are you sloshed or tired or both? Did you have trouble? Krahne was odd, too, when he left. You're so damn cussed. Won't even give an answer. - Have you at least got a smoke? - In my jacket. "Be sure to close the side window. Drafts are bad for you since you got wounded. I'll bake you nutcake again for St. John's Eve. But you write me back now. - It's been a year..." - Leave my mother be. "And take care, my boy, if you have to drive so much at night. The newspapers are always..." ls something wrong? - Robert. - You can't help it. No one can. It's just the way it is. Pull. Pull it, won't you? No. Get out! What did I do wrong? It's okay, Elli. Get dressed. Outside. Have you eaten at all? Should I maybe bring you up a kebab? But, child, take something if you drank too much. - Or is it your period? - No. I'm pretty nervous today, too. I've read this page four times already. It's not just the change of air or the autumn. There's been too much all at once. I sometimes wonder why I work so hard. If things kick up, the jets can take off once, but they won't land again. The others are as fast as we are. And if things don't kick up, it'll be obsolete in two years. But I guess one has to do one's duty. And... it's well paid, too. Once we've got used to things, we'll settle in. It was a pleasant evening. Apart from the stupid war game. A bit childish. But... John... Dear John, please listen to me for a second. If you don't resign from your job, tomorrow morning, if we don't go across immediately... I won't be able to stay with you, I'll have to leave you. -Inge. - I don't want to lose you, John. I'll lose you if I have to stay here. I'm so afraid. Hold me tight. But it's crazy stuff I'm talking, isn't it? Hold me tight! No! - Why can't we go in? - The MP is in there. What did the MP ask? If Sergeant Rodgers was here last night with Anni. I set them straight. If someone does a bunk, they go check with his girl first. I don't put up with such things. Two half liters, one open. Filterless smokes. On my tab. They couldn't know you're an exception in Sohnen. Everyone else is glad to have lots of Americans lodging with them. Anni didn't come home last night. Do you know anything? Me? Five rolls, two packs of curd, a kilo of soft soap. They're going at it as bad as Hottentots. Worse. And our lot go along with it. Got change for the phone? The published communiqu√© reveals that the statesmen reached mutually acceptable terms. There were again numerous accidents yesterday on Sunday. Near Wetzlar in Hesse, a full omnibus collided in the mist with a car from Kassel. The driver of the car was killed, an omnibus passenger slightly injured. Rhenish Palatinate and HunsrUck were accident-free. You've been listening to Westdeutscher Rundfunk News. The next news broadcast is at 10:30. This is Hessischer Rundfunk. Now it's time for Jolly Monday Melodies. - Okay. - Stop. You're to report to the hut. - They're waiting for you. - Who is? Hello? One second. I'll connect. Mr. Gaines, it's your home. You can speak from here if need be. Inge? Morning. Please get the car from the garage. I have to go to HQ. - Where's this Neidhardt? Come on. - About that mess-up. Will you join me? Reiss and Brockmann's delivery cards and the loading bay receipts are correct. You gentlemen checked them. So no gravel is missing from the roadbed. It can't be! Maybe it can if too much was stamped out inadvertently or intentionally. Enough. I don't stamp. I just monitor. Why suspect me? Couldn't it be Sergeant Rodgers? But Bill's American. I'm only a bloody German civilian. Not even Jewish. Here I am, but why isn't Bill being questioned? - Are you the driver Robert Neidhardt? - Keep me out of it. I didn't drive black gravel, they can confirm that. One second. This is costing me money. This isn't about gravel, Mr. Neidhardt. What I want to know is, when did you last see Bill Rodgers? Yesterday at around 6:00, in Mrs. Marbach's garden. Krahne can confirm that. - They wanted to go for a walk. -"They"? Bill and Anni. Anni Peel, Mrs. Marbach's niece. Is she Sergeant Rodgers' girlfriend? No, his fianc√©e. Is something up with Bill? - You're a friend of Bill's, right? - Yes, I'd say so. Do you find it possible that your friend was involved in this gravel thing? No way. Bill was straight as a die. He'd never have done it. Much too straight, I'd say. - Funny. Mr. Krahne said the opposite. - What? I just... - That'd be all, Mr. Neidhardt. - Mr. Neidhardt, one second. - Yes? - I have a question. Why did you say, "Bill was straight as a die"? "Was," not "is." I said "was"? I just said it, I mean, it's just what I said. - So "He'd never have" means nothing? -"He'd never have"? - You said, "He'd never have done it." - What's the meaning of this? - Perhaps you know he won't return. - Why not? Sergeant Rodgers and Anni Peel have been missing since yesterday. I know nothing about that. Fine, then I can be leaving. I have other things to do. You can't go and have nothing else to do. You're on leave. We'll call it that. Until Bill Rodgers reappears. It may be that both you and Rodgers together have been... Thank you, Mr. Neidhardt, for the character reference for Bill. Well, if that's how things were... A good boy. It'd be bad. - You know Miss Peel? - Of course, she sits there. - Why did she not come in today? - She'll be with her boyfriend. Do you know what the little radio Miss Peel carried looked like? Miss Hoesch. Japanese. A transistor. With VHF. From the AFEX. ENTERING THE SITE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK This gravel thing is out of hand. I have to go to HQ about it. Have myself ticked off. You're right, I need to look for a new job. Worse still is the thing with Bill Rodgers and the German girl. A terrible accident. They were so young. What accident? It was yesterday. Not far from the air base. First I've heard of it. I think I heard as I was getting the car from the garage. Bill Rodgers? Why hadn't anyone heard? I'm going straight back. You Yankee ass! I hear there was an accident yesterday. An American and a German girl. It's unreported. It was the first accident-free Sunday in two months. Only a cyclist broke a wrist near Kirn. I must have been mistaken. Surprise attacks... Retaliation might be considered... The converted KC 735 air tankers, those with the modern... I buried a tommy gun here years back. A Russian one. I'd have done several years. I couldn't find it. But this was in the bushes. It's pretty new. Smart, huh? What do you want here? Why are you spying on me? Krahne! What's up with you? Krahne! Krahne! Otto! - Neidhardt? - Yes. The lady from Sunday evening is here. The one who went up with you. She wants to know when and where she can talk to you this evening. I'll be right there. Change. How was the Sunday? I've seen bigger dwarfs. Since Mauthausen, all dwarfs are big. Saturday was good. Say, when will we finally get out of here? We shouldn't be seen together. Not here. - I want to know... - I'll explain at my place this afternoon. No. I'm staying till you've told me what you did with them. Beneath the roadbed. Like Tub. Covered with gravel. - No. - It was the only possibility. Want an espresso too? Or a beer? No, nothing. I have no time. I have gravel to drive. Go ahead. - Why are you dumping here? - What? - This bit is done. - Okay, the next load goes that side. Heard from Bill? I thought... - I thought you were in Wiesbaden. - I was there. The Air Force is even worse than the German Financial Administration. Twenty men in four trucks came to do pressure tests. Along the whole roadbed. If there's one bad spot, an oil rag, say, or an old tire lying in the gravel, and the dial gauge indicates it, I can tear it all up and start again. And we'll be another month in this damn place. Who knows what the guys threw instead of gravel? I have to go back to the LAD. I might be home late. We need two trucks for pressure tests. Each loaded with precisely ten tons. No overtime will be paid. Just the normal rate. You're nuts! The building society needs my every penny. My special thanks to you, Neidhardt. I happen to be interested. Yes? I thought you might want a cup of coffee, Mr. Krahne. Gladly. Thank you. - You didn't go to work today. - I have the day off. I can't make head or tail of it. Anni can't have run off with Bill. What is going on? I won't be able to face my sister in Rostock. Well, Mrs. Marbach... It's us who have to take responsibility for the young. She didn't take a thing. Not even her handbag. Only the radio. - She had that? - Yes, she always does. Sorry, does a Mr. Krahne live here? I would like to speak to him. - I'm going, Major. - I understand. I've had it, too. - What's the point? - Right. - Won't you dump your load first? - When I get my stamp tomorrow. It needs to be orderly, Mr. Wiechers, or people call you a thief. I'd rather drive the same gravel twice. They already passed the spot. Eight o'clock at yours. R√∂ssler, another record now, okay? I can pay for all the marches I want. It's no longer forbidden. Thank God. - What's with him? - I don't know. He's alone. Who isn't? See reason, R√∂ssler. - The Yanks are complaining. - They can kiss my... Filthy Jew. There's not much point you going to this trouble. Why's that? Who knows if our friend Bill will return? Why wouldn't he? Evening. What are you doing there? The radio you were asking about is in the car. Funny. It was under it at midday. Will you have a schnapps with me? I don't dare go in alone. Okay, mister. I'll be right there. Mine's a caraway schnapps. Coming up. So long. Mr. Neidhardt, I think you could help me if only you wanted to. - What does the clown want with me? - He's a CIA snoop. No? Because of the gravel? - Don't let him grill you. - No one gets anything out of me. I'll get him so hot he'll want something else instead. There are weird things in the world. Know what a Yank just told me? They don't bury their boys here. They freeze them in ice and fly them back. How about that? Why tell me? - Yourjokes never make me laugh. - It's not a joke. Hey, Robert, listen. You must have noticed. I'm through here. We are, too. I'm off to Canada with Mr. Krahne. I'm sick of it here. It's no life, not in the long term. Money isn't everything. I know there's more to it for me. I mean, you only want to go to bed with me. That's fine, I'm not reproaching you. But I can get that from anyone if I need it. From Krahne, too. Of course. I don't like sleeping with guys much, anyway. You know that. By the way, I haven't done anything with him yet. It's only... But there's something else with Krahne. I don't know what... I can't really express it. He needs me, he says. Maybe I'll let him give me a child. At least I'll have something that belongs to me. He has the tickets and papers. For me, too. I wanted you to know. Enjoy your trip. Don't waste time, Elli. You know what you want. That's what you're like. You bastard! You care about nothing! - That's none of your damn business. - Robert! Robert! I'd try out that Mr. Krahne first! Maybe it won't work with the child. Then you can forget about the good life. Krahne. What's up with you? - You were so odd this morning. - Up with me? Nothing. So why did you run off like a forest monkey? Hey. Don't play the idiot. What did you talk to Moeller about? - Him? He asked about the gravel. - Well? - Well what? - What did you say? That I know nothing about it. Or about Bill and Anni. He was mostly banging on about that. - Well? - He didn't ask me about the radio. The smart one you found in the woods. But I could tell him about that. So let me be. He might be interested. Maybe the bush contains something else. You filthy bastard! You know what you are? You're a murderer! - Robert... - Stop, I have to flee. Robert, listen to me... Robert, you mustn't run away. Go to the police, tell them. They haven't found anything yet. No one knows a thing. It'd be voluntary. That would mitigate. - It might only be hit-and-run. - I won't do it. No one will now believe it was just an accident. I have no witnesses. Unfortunately. Or thank God. You have. Me. Out of the question, no way. And it's too late, anyway. Why didn't you call the police? Why bury...? - I don't understand. - Why? I can tell you precisely. Because I am as I am. I trust no one and nothing. I'm experienced, know what's what. Justice is only for those in power. And what would have happened? I'd have lost my driving license and concession. I'd be the fall guy. Black gravel in the back, a woman in the cabin. They'd give me shit: "Your hands were on her, not on the wheel." The stuff with Krahne would have come out and Reiss would have sung. No one wants to be linked to dead bodies. And them? They were beyond help, anyway. But me. And you, too. Yes, I did it for your sake, too. You would have been exposed. And all you care so much about would have been wrecked: your order and security. So I just did it, damn it all! - So what now? - Now? I have to go. It just didn't work out. These things happen. And my nerves were rattled. Why? Because you're back. That's why. Now leave me be. I need to think straight. I have to be in Luxembourg in three hours. Know what you're fleeing? Your conscience. You pretend it's not true. - But it's impossible. - Conscience? Nonsense. Luckily I don't have any of that crap. I'm leaving for your sake, too, I'll have you know. It makes no difference now. For my sake? Yes. That slimy shit Moeller. But he won't get me. Stay behind this till I'm back. Sorry, the gate was so invitingly opened. And I have an inquisitive nature. What a peculiar place. Did you build all this? Yes. What are you doing here? I'm not here on official business. I'm not involved with the gravel thing. I already said that. So... That Mr. Krahne... Otto Krahne. Do you know him well? - I know him from around the place. - What was your fight about? - A woman. - Oh, right. - Is that CIA business? - No, but I chanced to be in the Atlantic. And I really wondered about the expressions Krahne used. What expressions? Did he not call you a murderer? - It's unusual, to say the least. - He was afraid I'd do him in. - He's shit-scared. - Yes, of life. Like so many. I just visited him. - He wanted to speak to you? - No, vice versa. He was talkative. Between us, I don't like him either. I can understand that. He told me a lot. It was pretty interesting. - He wants to go to Canada. - That's right. He said so. Now I remember that church. It's St. Margarethen near Ruhpolding. Could be. I copied it from some calendar. He talked to me about Bill Rodgers and Anni Peel, too. Oh, yes? Which is why I wanted to talk to you again. Mr. Neidhardt, two people vanished without trace yesterday. Why won't you tell me what you know? What would I know? - Why me, of all people. - I'm not just asking you. You might have kept something to yourself, something you shouldn't have. I don't know what you mean. You might know Peel was in contact with Eastern agents. You were friends with them. Oh. I said "were" like you did this morning. That's what happens if you anticipate. I actually think Bill and Anni might have gone over to the East. - To the East? - Yes. Sadly, that seems to be the case. Bill's father was a Polish emigrant called Rogalski, Peel is from Rostock, in the so-called GDR. Their wedding permission was refused. - No! - Bill didn't tell you? - No. - So it's easy to imagine these days. I'll leave you be. You have a visitor. I'm not inquisitive about that. A very peculiar place. I'd like to see it by day. They've gone to the East. To the police sleuths, they're in the East. Deserted. Gone. They think it's because wedding permission was denied. They won't find anything in the roadbed. Krahne kept quiet. I'm no longer at risk. I'm staying here. Now for sure. With you. To Canada. Why don't you get out? I saw the car and... John, I have to tell you something. I just have to. The sergeant and the girl are dead. It was an accident. They were run down by a truck. I was there. I'm as guilty as them and Robert. I ran away. He brought the bodies here. They're under the gravel. I only found out this afternoon. - Who is Robert? - Robert's the man who gave us a tow. I lived with him before I knew you. I didn't know that I... was still so attached to him. I was with him again. Just now. I didn't want to. But it made me happy, as terrible as that sounds. He won't turn himself in. I tried to make him. Give him a head start so he gets across the border. Please do it for me. Then it's all the same and you can send me away. Who knows about this, just you and this man? - Yes. - Then there was no accident. I can't use any bodies under my ramp. That you have to understand. Nor a wife involved in such things. Or a divorce. It's not as easy as you'd like. I won't have it. - I don't believe you're saying this. - This conversation never took place. Pull yourself together. I was just passing and saw you're still at it. - My wife. - How do you do? - Any results? - Everything's fine. - We'll be on our way. - Congratulations. I'm not so lucky. It seems Rodgers has deserted with this Anni Peel. Major. Major! Please step this way, an irregularity's been found. The check at six was fine. They want to dig up the gravel, it's a base failure. A stranger on a strange street I move from town to town Hello? Neidhardt, telephone. - Connect. - Mr. Neidhardt! Mr. Night-Heart! How nice it would be to be home How nice it would be at yours I have never forgotten you In this strange place... They've found something. They're digging. We have to flee! - We? What do you mean, ‚Äùwe‚Äù? - I'm coming. Meet me where the... breakdown was. Flash your lights three times so I know it's you. Come quietly, Krahne. You know why. - So... who snitched? Reiss? - Brockmann, too. At long last. Those dirty pigs. Canada. Down the drain a third time. How nice it would be to be home... Don't get in. You'll be a millstone. I might make it alone. You'd be ruined. I don't care. It's all that's left. I don't want to think about it. I don't want security now. Take me with you! - Stop! No, Inge! - I love you. Go away! It was all for you! Look, it's all fine. How long will you stay? You wanted to return to the US. I don't know. My wife... Inge wanted to go back. - Where is she? - I think she drove off earlier. It was her dog we found there. She looked for him for ages. Inge!
