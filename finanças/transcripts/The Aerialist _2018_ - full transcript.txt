We can't overlook that age is a factor here, particularly in recovery time. Have you been taking any pain medications? Ibuprofen. Any history of opioid use? No. Well, I'm surprised you can manage it. The nerve impingement alone has got to be very painful. How about sensation? Still having numbness in the fingers? It takes a couple days to come back. Well, soon it might not. How soon? Hello.

Oh, but that number you choreographed for the Grammys was incredible. People need to know who you are. - Piece of gum? - Do I need it? Oh, no, I was just offering. All right, just in case. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Shoot. So, they still call you The Hawk. You did your homework. Yeah, it's harder when it's pre-internet history, but... Well, that's prehistoric. I want to sit down with you, tonight, I hope, and get a real in-depth interview about your career and celebrate everything that's happening here, but, first, a little history. - History? - Oh, I'll take it. Life for me started when I learned how to fly. - Your aerial career. - Mm. Yes, well, we'll get to that, but... Life starts at flight, that makes for a great headline, actually. But there is a gap from your gymnastics career. Yeah, well, you did your homework, so you know how that ends. This is the story that's worth telling. Hey, you know what, I'm so sorry, I just realized that I have to go do something. We can talk after rehearsal, okay? Okay. Excuse me. Sorry. Are you the reporter? - Yes. - Okay. - Here you go. - Thanks. Cool. Hey, aren't you... The daughter. And I'm out of the will if I don't do something useful, so... You seem nice. Write that you saw me doing this, okay? Okay. You okay? Yeah. I'm good, I'm good. Listen, while I figure a few things out, can you get them up in the air? Oh, I thought I'd give them a day to settle in, at least. We don't have time to settle in. - Hey, you. - Hey. New lighting units are going in right here. - T-Bone. - Oh, we've got time. Is this a load issue? Mm-mm, new ones are actually lighter. Jane. Well, don't worry. No, wait, can they share the same truss? We're not starting from scratch. I know it's not from scratch. Downstage motors gonna - have to shift. - T-Bone, give us a minute. Yeah, Iris has a wrist thing anyway, so it's probably... - Iris is indestructible. - Chief, this will take - two seconds. - Yeah, well, they're my two seconds. Yeah, but safety first, right... We don't have time for safety first! Can you get them in the fucking air?! We have two weeks. It's not enough time. Can you just make it happen? Yes, we can work low. - Yes. - Thank you. What are you looking at, Hathaway? Fuck. I'm gonna go hang some hammocks. - Yeah. - Okay. The fuck was all that about? - You all right? - Yeah. Okay, let's do it again. And one, two, three, four, and spin, six, seven, eight, up and in, three, four, bird arms, six, seven, eight, and up, two, three, four, five, six, seven, splat it! Yes! Now that's a good time. Waking up. - Oh, Lord. - Hey. How is it? It was easier last year. Ha, you were in better shape. Girl, has anybody washed these? You know they haven't. Hathaway, would you... I know, have they? Would you have them run through this please? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Hey, you guys, do it again. Stay low, please, and don't do anything stupid. She's ready, but, look, it's your decision. I just need to make this happen now. Yeah, we're gonna have to go to, like, plan B or plan C or whatever the fuck. And I was just in there and I almost was, like, passing out, so... Of course. All right. Thank you, Richard. I'm sorry. It's fine. It's not, it's back. I'm out here smoking like it's the fucking cure. Does Aurora know? You know how spooked she gets before a tour. Spencer. I just told Richard, though. Fuck, I thought I could get you guys through rehearsals. You don't have to. We got this. What about you? Are you up for this? How's the body? I'm fine. I'm scared, Jane. Come on, come on. We've survived the road and each other, and we've thrived on the road with each other. It's been the greatest experience of my life to be part of this family. But you guys are all gonna have to go out there without me. I'm sorry. But I know you can handle it. You're all well-behaved. I'm not looking at you, Hathaway. But if there are, like, any squabbles going forward, Jane is now senior officer on deck. Okay, got my cigs, I'm gonna go stand on a beach. We're gonna go with you. No arguments. - Yeah. - Paloma, stay and rehearse. I can't stand in for your mama anymore, darling. I can rehearse on a beach. Hey, we all can rehearse - on the beach. - Yeah. - Come on. - I'll bring the music. We love you so much. Love you so much. All right, enough, please. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Get him, get him. Grab my boots. Bring wine. Please bring the wine. Oh, something's come up, I can't do tonight. Can we do tomorrow night? You guys wanted out of rehearsals, right? Good excuse. Hey. Hi. I thought the dancers were assigned the same rooms as last time. Oh, well, Jane's letting me stay here so I don't have to drive back to the 'Bu. Oh. And so where is Jane crashing? She didn't tell me. I barely recognize it. Sure this is the place? My eyes aren't that bad. Seven, one, three, two. Ow. Hey. That little cut is not the issue. You could barely hold your knife at dinner. You should go see the gal that put me back together. She can put things back together? I'll give her a call. I'll hook you up. I'm fine. If you're the director now, you can take the time to recover. There were no aerials in the show before you. You made this show. It's a family effort. Wouldn't take this family stuff too seriously, especially with Richard. He's all right. You coming in? I got a long drive. Oh. Call her. Walk me to my car? I almost forgot. You're gonna wanna open the gift first, before you read the card. Okay. And don't worry, it's not a knife. I moved on from those. Are you kidding me?! Dan. Ah, I'm practically cutting myself on your biceps, so you must be real. I wasn't surprised not to see you at the funeral, but I thought, "Just maybe." Well, even if I wanted to go, Gayle wasn't having it. Oh, the new wife is always leery of the old wife, I guess. Leery? She sent lawyers after me. Oh. She was surprised to discover my name was still on the title. That explains it. Explains what? When she came to clear out their things, I caught her trying to throw out a box of your stuff. I have stuff? Just old documents, gymnastic medals, I put them back in the attic. She thought I owed David something. So now you owe her something? But what? The house? No. They haven't lived here in forever, so don't sweat it. He didn't hate me? No. To David. To David.

Press record, I'll tell you a couple of stories. Great. - All right. - I don't wanna do this. I understand that this is hard. Yeah, 'cause it doesn't take a genius. Look at me. I'm not her, I'm nothing like her, I couldn't be, - even if I wanted to. - We don't want your mom, we want you. Your body doing the moves. Your voice singing out. Oh, no, I'm not doing that. Paloma, you used to sing like a bird. Yeah, but I don't anymore, all right? That's her thing. She owns that thing. What, all right, let's leave that at the door, all right? This is a job, so step up. If you drag your feet, we all drag our feet, okay? But why do I have to sing? What is the point of that? Because you've gotta engage, you've to do it all, that's the act, okay? This isn't for her, it's for us, okay? Okay. And I know you can be cuter. Come on, come on. - Come on, come on! - Okay. - Come on, okay, okay. - All right.

That's a crazy family - we got here. - Yeah, I love it. I turned and I looked and it was Jane. And even though she fell flat on her face, she still came off stage and said, "Good show." Oh, I was there. Oh, I was there. But, you know, Jane only had a small wild phase. And maybe only made one mistake. - Mm-hm. - Several times. - Oh, yeah. - Just the one, one mistake, - but more than once. - Several times. Yeah. But again and again. Uh, can I help you? I was supposed to wait for Richard, but wanted to see how you guys rehearse. I'm Xavier. Zee, for short. I'm gonna be taking over for Spencer. Like hell you are. Yeah, should've waited for Richard. Look, I just want you guys to know that I am a big fan of Spencer's work. He did some cool stuff back in the day. And I get his style, so this will go seamless. This is so not happening. Wait, I thought Jane was director now. Yeah. You're Jane Hawkins? I've been looking forward to working with you. Happy birthday. Richard, I don't understand your thinking. It should be Jane directing, if anybody. This guy is like throwing a wrench - into a well-oiled machine. - Who is he, anyway? I've never even heard of him. Who cares about who he is and where he came from? We don't need him. You a roadie? Concert technician. Who's that? That's a reporter. And she is not going to give a shit about you. She's here for Jane. And the other one is the daughter, you know, the daughter, someone I raised since she slept in road cases. Please, don't even think of going there. Capiche, amigo? Richard, come on. She has more experience - than anybody. - She has enough on her plate already. Her solo's a big part of the act, she manages all the aerials, deals with safety. It's just too much to... I can deal with safety- - Ask her to, let me finish. Just too much to ask because this is not just another tour, so we don't want to give the fans just the same well-oiled machine, but some real surprises, and some fresh blood is gonna help us do that. Come on, we have to open our arms here, and let some new family in, especially now that Spencer's stepping away. Come on, let's just commit to putting on a show that everyone will remember for the rest of their lives. Okay? Jane? Does Aurora know? Yes. Okay, then. So, let me see what you've been rehearsing up there. Oh, we spent all morning in the air. We're done. Ah, but you've been resting, partying, arguing about me. Come on. Let me see it. Please.

Don't have to run the whole thing, just want to see what this looks like. It's just those abs and those abs... Creating symmetry, people. Okay, thank you. Let's run it. Jane, can you have Iris hang on the hang thing for just, like, two eights more? Just till we hit blackout. The meat hook? Yeah. I love you. Okay, and music please.

Hey, this is a closed set. - I thought... - Not a word of this gets out, or all access is cut. Hey. Oh, come on, what's happening? Did that hurt that much? It didn't hurt me. Oh, honey. Oh, Iris, Iris. So, she's good? Yeah, she's pregnant, so we're gonna need to make some adjustments. Well, what do you mean "make some adjustments"? Define "adjustments." And another thing, when I say we're done rehearsing in the air, we're done rehearsing in the air. Oh, hold on, I didn't hire the pregnant lady. She's six weeks. She didn't know she was gonna keep it. Now she knows, we can make some changes. I'm sorry, no. That is definitely not happening. That is not a part of her contract and it's not a part of the show. Why are we even talking about this, it's abs, abs, symmetry! Okay, I might know a couple of people who are available. That's okay, I got this. Wait, these are very specialized skills. There aren't very many dancers who can do aerials, much less aerialists that can dance. I said I got this. You know, I was wondering why you looked so good. You remember Carmen from the Brittany tour? - Mm-hm. - She's got two kids now. - Right? - You'll be fine. - I know. - Iris. What size are you? No, that motherfucker is not trying to fit someone else into your costume. What the hell, man? Hathaway, why do I think we're gonna get along so great? I have no idea. Listen, I'm sorry that Iris has to quit, and you do, and I know that everyone wanted to celebrate, but now we're a person short, which means we have to find and train a someone new, and this is not me being insensitive, okay? She's known for, what, six weeks? Dude, seriously. Yeah, seriously. So what's her size? A zero, obviously. Thank you. Look, I'm just gonna put this all out here just so we're all on the same page: This show might've been a walk in the park back in the day, but not this time. We are going to refresh the older numbers, we're gonna add some new ones, so eat your Wheaties, lose some weight, drink your Ensure... Hold up. "Drink your Ensure"? You Dunning-Kruger motherfucker. Bianca. You see what's he's doing, right? I mean, they didn't send him in here to tweak the show. No, they brought this genius in here to blow it up. - Yup. - Mm-hm. "Drink your Ensure"? Bitch, I can run rings around you. We all can. She's right. You know what? Come on, Iris. - No, Bianca... - No, no, this girl's got a real family going on, I'm gonna go be a part of that, 'cause this one here is dead. - Come on now, it's cool. - You'll see. Come on, Bianca. You'll see. Okay. Anyone else? You've said enough. Hey, if the wheels are gonna come off, - I'd rather it be now. - Oh, you want something - to come off, buddy? - Hey, okay, all right, everybody calm down. Bianca will change her mind. Change her mind? When has she ever done that? Okay, we're on break. Fuck. Jane. - Hey. - He kicked me out. I'll get you back in tomorrow. Tell him you're my assistant. Well, what about tonight? The interview? Tomorrow night, I promise. Well, I can't, I've got a flight. Can we just do this over the phone. You gotta get down here. Iris and Bianca just quit. This guy is toxic. Look, I don't know what to tell you. Artists need to try new things to stay relevant, and this guy is the new thing. Richard. I'm sorry, but everyone is expendable. Expendable? Hello? Hi. Is this Kelly? Yeah, this is Kelly. Hey, Kelly, it's Jane. I was calling Aurora. Oh, I'm sorry, she's not available. Hey, I'm just curious, this is her private line, isn't it? It is, but Richard changed her number, he just wants her in the bubble. He's got her on lockdown, no distractions until we open. Could you give me that number? It's really important. I would, but you can only get it from Richard. I'm sorry. Okay. Thanks. Take care. I was 43 when I stopped trying to have a baby. A doctor told me I was too old. Now Iris is having one at 43. I have two now. Somewhere. I have a career. I'm not gonna let that twerp burn it down. The oldest aerialist in rock and roll. You do know how dumb that sounds, right? It's what I got. I mean, that's not even a category. Anyway, I can't quit. I leased my place in Vegas. Let me go ahead and state the obvious here: You're in a house you own. Maybe it's time you got off the road. And do what? Give massages? Hey. Hey. I was in the hood and wanted to talk to you about what happened. But I see you're busy, so. Hey. Catch you tomorrow. Thank you, for the cake and remembering. That reporter was asking a bunch of questions about you. Seemed kinda personal. I hope you don't mind I just told her to fuck off. I want one of these everywhere I go today. Did I miss a party? Nope! Just fulfilling my destiny. Someone's gotta bring up the rear. Mm, nice voice. Compared to who? I need to find some other way to impress Mother. I read some interviews where she had nothing but nice things to say about you. Can you interview me so I can get a message back to her? What do you think of Jane? I think I like her better when she's not playing second mom. Oh, god. So comfortable. Hey, are you guys dancers on this show? Thank you. That is better than being carded. Come on, dancer's are this way. Let's go. Good Morning. Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday. Had to do that for legal reasons. But I guess, if you're gonna do a story about Jane, falling's gonna be part of it. You have free reign today. Thank you.

Yeah, I'll just call you. The fans know us as The Family and we have been performing for them for nearly 20 years, and you come in here and treat us like we're nothing? - Okay, okay, hold on. - That is not okay. - Hold on a second. - No, he needs to hear this. It's either us or him. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, really. Bubba, okay, calm down. Could you give us some space? No, I kinda want to hear this. Would you please come with me? Come on. The fans would've loved to see Iris, just getting bigger, and we could have had a dancer replace her - when the time comes. - No, listen, listen... Bianca, all she needed was for us to say that The Fam is still The Fam. Bianca made her own choice. Okay, well, then let's make ours. It's either us or him. - We're going to Richard. - Richard doesn't care. That's what I'm trying to tell you... Then we go to the diva. No, I don't know that she cares. Richard told me that all of us are expendable, every single one of us. - What? - Yes, exactly. And that means he is too. If we say we're all outta here, then Richard will fire him - in a heartbeat. - He won't. He... Come on, yes, he will. - Let's do it. - Let's go. No, no, no, no. I can't. I can't. Okay, Jane, come on. We fight together. I know you're scared, it's all right. It's too risky, I can't. Dammit, this doesn't work without you. You'd really just let me go? Please. You have to destroy everything? - Jane. - Please, - it's not that simple. - Jane. It's not. It really is. Watch. You suck. I quit. See? Simple. Is that it for today? Hold tight. Janie. I wanna get down. Come down. Come down. All right, come down easy. Come down easy. All right, you're okay. Okay. That's it, I'm done. Don't go. Please. I'm already gone. Please, come on. You know, I was counting on the money for this. I already leased my apartment for this, but, Jane, I'm not gonna do this! And I can't believe I let them go and I didn't follow them. But you know what? It's because I always followed you! Sure you still want to do this? Yes. I felt I had to lie about my age at first, but then I really learned that you can't tell how old someone is on stage, especially when they're in the air, so I booked work in Vegas pretty quick. And you reconnected with Serena. I saw some video of you two rehearsing. Yeah. You made the gymnastics team for the 1980 Olympics. And then Russia invaded Afghanistan. Ah, the boycott. And you tried again in '84, but ruptured your Achilles. Yeah, that's what I was known for. But what happened after that? You dropped off the radar. Couple years of suicidal thoughts. Can I show you something? Where did you get this? At the gymnastic camp where you taught. This was how I bounced back. You started performing. Mm. I found one reference of you training for the '88 Olympics with a coach named Sergei Kilinski. Is that true? Yes. So you were trying for your third Olympics. It's all I knew how to do. I was too old, probably. I didn't realize how much the sport was changing, it was getting tougher, younger. The young girls can do these crazy tricks. Their center of gravity is higher. They don't have any hips. I'm sorry, it's my own private summer. Sergei was expensive. How did you afford him? I had a sponsorship with IGC. A sponsorship? Well, I didn't have him that long, anyway. When I didn't make it to the trials, I walked away. I got married. I'm sorry about your ex. David would sit right where you're sitting. Did you ever want to have kids? Let's not make the article about that stuff. You called the dancers your family. They are. Family is important to you. Sure. Then why didn't you fight for them? Excuse me? Seems like you could have today. You know what? I think it's time for sleep. Okay, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get inside your head so I can paint the right picture. You're clearly very driven. Your life reflects that. You seem to choose career over relationships, though, which I'm not judging, I'm just trying to figure out whether you're naturally a loner or whether you wanted family and it didn't work... I want to go to sleep. Okay. You do realize that I'm trying to write an article about you, the person, not just the stuff you've done. I need more from you than stuff I could get off the internet, so please, I'm sorry to get intense here, but I've come a long way. Let me in a little bit. I'm sorry if you're the latest person I let down today. Thank you for your time. What kind of story are you writing? I was hoping a good one.

A sponsorship? Well, I didn't have him that long, anyway. When I didn't make it to the trials, I walked away. I got married. Eight, and spin it, two, three, four, hup! Up, up, up, up, up! Up, stand up! I didn't say splits. And splits. Seven, eight, back to double stag. Find it, find it. Beth, more arch, more arch. Straighten your legs, straighten your legs. Okay, hop up.

I saw you once, in Vegas, when I was a kid and I told my mom, "That's what I want to do," but she wasn't having it, not after she saw your friend fall. Ah. So I'm kinda getting a late start. I was 42 when I started, so you're not late. Jump up. So what have you done to yourself? I don't know. I stopped going to see doctors. You do know that I'm a doctor, yes? Resist. Well, I know that you helped Serena, so. Mm-hm. This way. This way. Yes, I did help Serena. Lay on your stomach. That was hard for her. She had to stop. I wouldn't tell you to stop. Plus, athletes never listen anyway. They push through, until they break. I don't think it's age with you, I think it's injury. Age is an injury Oh, so this is it? Yeah. Any other big falls? I was attempting an Omelianchik on beam. Well, what would possess you to do that? I was young and stupid. Can you turn over for me? That is not a move somebody does in their spare time. I was training for '88. Oh, you were trying to get back in there. Mm-hm. Oh, you fell, you landed right here. Yes. I thought so. How can you tell? The body remembers. Hey. What's going on? You okay? I've done everything wrong. I made the wrong choices. Hey now. I did it to myself. The body remembers, and it never forgave me. Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. I don't have anybody. I'm alone. Hey, I count, a little. And you've got your dancing family. No, I let them down. I let everybody down. Everyone lets everyone down, says or does something stupid. That's what families do. It's too late. Maybe not. I mean, if it really was a family, there's gotta be some forgiveness there, if it's worth anything. Like, I'm forgiving you right now for getting snot on my favorite shirt. Hey, hey. Really. The family you choose, you can choose again. Hey, Hollis. Hey, hummingbird. I just need a minute with her. Can't, she's in the bubble right now. Have you heard about The Fam?

We need to cut overhead. It's just business. You didn't want to buy out our contracts, so you want us to quit. You need us to quit. It's her last tour.

I want to be really clear on this, so I'm gonna make eye contact with you: I'm the director. You got a problem, you come to me, you don't go over my head, ever. Well, I'm the aerial choreographer, so I'm kind of over your head all the time. I'm cutting your solo. I could drop a motor on him. Insurance will cover it. Our girl deserves better. She does. Mm-hm. Do you still have the keys to this place? Mm-hm. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I'm thinking, "How is it we're the same age?" You were right. Oh, my god. I miss you. I missed you too. You're glowing. I'm not nauseous. Hathaway, you home?! Come on. Now the road's gonna go on with out us, be like we were never there. I wonder if Aurora is even going to notice. So, who was that guy with the greasy hands? Don't tell me he was a masseuse. I'm not buying it. My neighbor. No. If I've been running cold lately, it's because I am so very, very goddamned hot.

It's distracting. Lip-sync. Hey, I want the circle things, the lyras, to spin in the opposite direction when the chorus hits. No. No? No, it's not possible. I mean, physically. Were you under the impression those are motorized, because they're on swivels. It's momentum that's making these young'uns spin around. It's nothing else but mass times velocity. Can't just change the laws of physics when the chorus hits, kid. I actually had to Google Dunning-Kruger. You know what? You're fired. Pack your shit! All right, that's it, everyone take 30. 30? Jane! - Oh, god. - Jane! You're not running this show. I can make a safety call anytime. Check my contract. Yeah, well, it's in my contract that I'm the director, which means I get some goddamn respect! You think that?! Yes! For fuck's sake, what is your problem? You're supposed to be a team player. Richard said, "Don't worry about Jane." He did? Yeah, but all I have is Jane all up in my face, contradicting me in front of everybody, shitting on my ideas, and shutting down my fucking rehearsals. I'm actually trying to help you. Oh, because you think that I don't know what I'm doing. I've choreographed quite a few tours before. Not with this many elements. Not with aerials. Yeah, but I have the vision. That's why I got the gig. That's why I get respect. Got it? Okay, just listen to people with more experience than you, okay? Just do that. - Oh, just try that. - Mm-hm. Learn from the ancient ones. You know what your problem is? You want this gig. Get over it. Fire me. Go ahead. Fire me. You can't, you can't. You can't do what I do. You cut my solo, for what? To get back at me? You just lost your costume change. - Okay, well... - You can't fire T-Bone. He's the most important person on this tour. They would fire you a hundred times before they fired him, and the reason you don't know that is because you're green. You don't know how a tour works, you don't know how I work, and you certainly don't know how close you just came to losing an arm. You grind me down without a clue that I am the best person to have in your corner. And the worst part about it is, you have no fucking clue that you're being used. Hey. Still here? I'm sorry about the other night. Is that it? Is that the article? Why did you lie to me? I lied to you? When you said you had a sponsorship with the IGC. I did have a sponsorship with the IGC. With the IGC. No, I mean for '88. I checked and you didn't. Maybe my memory's failing too. Is that something I should write about? What is your deal? I agreed to a story about my aerial career, that's it. But you're digging into my history, asking everyone questions that are none of your business. It's a story about you, Jane. Of course I'm gonna ask questions. But why stuck on the past? Why? I wanted to know how you got here. And why focus on my failure trying to get into the Olympics? It's your gymnastics career. How is that off base to ask? Because I don't want my entire life exposed. It's just background information. Fine. Totally off the record, but how did a young woman with no affiliation, sponsors, or financial support pay for a top coach like Sergei Kilinski? Are you even a reporter? - What? - You wanna know how much money I had, how I could afford Sergei, you're looking for dirt in my personal life. Are you working for Gayle? - Who? - Gayle Bishop. - I don't know... - My ex-husband's widow. - I don't know her... - I don't owe Gayle a damn thing. Tell her to back off. - Jane... - And if she thinks that I have assets that she can have, she is out of her tiny mind. I never had any money, especially after my Achilles. You wanna know how I paid for Sergei? I sold my eggs. And it was the worst thing I ever did. So whatever it is you're up to, whatever's written there, just stop. This story's over. Told you she was in a bad mood. I can help you. Get you a scoop. "An insider look at today's most secretive pop star." Come on, no reporter gets that. I'll sneak you into tomorrow, to Aurora's show and tell. You can at least get something out of this. You definitely don't need Jane. Thank you. Did you learn anything? Is she dating somebody? Is she a martial artist? Did she give you any hint that she wants to retire? I would like to know that. She's focused on her career. She doesn't have time for anything else. How long can that last? Because she's so old? Because she's so injured. You haven't noticed? Get some sleep, everybody. Remember, tomorrow, eyes down. T-Bone, thank you so much for your continued services. Mea culpa. Goodnight. Easy. You were right, I need to listen more. Okay, well, let's just make a good show, all right? Yeah, and the thing you said about the costume change, yeah, I screwed up. Okay, obviously, your solo still has to go in. The only thing, I haven't actually seen it, and right now, I really need to. This is when I'm over the audience. The dancer pulls in the fabric and I offload. We actually need to extend this moment just a bit. No, no, it fits perfectly with the music. No, I added a headdress to her costume, so it's gonna take a little bit more time. Can you vamp on it, or something? Just vamp a bit. - Okay. - Just extend it out. Okay. That enough? We just need a little bit longer. Keep going. We'll make the music match, don't worry. Okay. Almost there. Okay. Good? No, no, no, keep going. Okay. Keep going. I can't. I gotta come down. You really were a time bomb, Hawkins. Good thing that didn't happen on the tour, huh? You want me to call 9-1-1? No. - Need to go to the hospital? - No. No. Dislocated. MRI in the morning. My guess, surgery in six weeks. Can you move your fingers? - No. - That may come back. But right now, your body's making a decision for you. It wants you to stop and you have no say in the matter, okay? Right now, your biggest healing tool is right there, so use it. Oh, the director said I could watch. Sorry, you're incorrect, 'cause now, it's my set. But he promised me. It's really important... Hey. That I'm here. Hey, no, it's cool, she's gonna hang in the back. No, she's not. Ma'am, please collect your things. Well, my car is blocked in. All right, well, you're just gonna have to wait upstairs.

Where are the aerials in that number? I wanted to keep it on the ground, you know, just keep the focus on you. No, no, I don't want the focus on me. Put the aerials back. And that's your choreography? Yes, but I was trying to... emulate Spencer's style. Oh, honey, I don't know what you were... What's up? How you doing? What's up, bro? Hi, how are you, sweetie? My man. You okay? Hey, what happened? Richard, what's going on here? It's a new approach. We just need time to adjust. There hasn't even been a single costume change! What am I supposed to do, prance around nake... What's your name? Runa. Give me the phone now, Runa. Now. I'm sorry, I didn't know I couldn't listen. Let's go. No, no. I thought we were done.

Midnight rehearsals all week to do this. We won't all be able to come with you, but we wanted to give you a proper farewell. What do you mean, "farewell"? Why can't you come? Well, Iris is pregnant, for starters. You slut! But I can still dance. Then you're coming. - Ah! - And what's your excuse? Well, we didn't fit the new vision. Yeah, we're not of the new breed. Basically, we were told we we're too old. - Too old? - Mm. Who's too old? Well, to be clear, I never said anyone was too old, I was just told to bring the show up to date. Up to date? Yeah, but I agree, that number was fantastic, and we are gonna put it in. "Up to date" is your little euphemism for "saving money." Richard, I want The Family back in the show. And these new young dancers? They have been working so hard, and look at how cute they are. Let's bring them too. We can talk about it. We are talking. And while we're talking, The Family already has one really great director. And we don't need another one. Yeah! You know I can't hit certain high notes anymore, so maybe you don't go so high, either. But you are not quitting. She's not quitting. Okay, now, you and I are gonna talk. Okay, hold on, I was just doing - whatever you told me to do. - Hey, Zee. Let's take a walk, man. Outside. - Come on. - Ooh! We're a family! Welcome to the family! You should take a break to heal. How are you supposed to get the show together if your body's not together? I'm fine. You always say that. Anyway, I was able to get an extra week of rehearsal in Nice, so hopefully, we'll able to work the kinks out there. Either way, the show must go on. Okay. What about this show? This house. Well, until I sell it, do you wanna split whatever comes in from the rental thing? Okay. Every little bit helps. Dan, you must get a real estate agent. I told you, I'm not doing that. Hi. Got a sec? We were just leaving. Well, flight's not till four. Got a few minutes. This is Runa. Ah. Should've interviewed me. I know all her secrets. I'm Dan. Would you put the bags in the car? And I'm gonna go put the bags in the car now. Give me a hand? Thank you for sending your articles. I'm sorry I was so paranoid. You're a good writer. Can't imagine what you're gonna write about me. We need to take this down. Well, look at you. That was really beautiful what you did for your friends. Where did you learn to do that? When I stopped competing in gymnastics. A gym rat. My mom was on the East German team back in the day. She wanted a child she could raise the same way. She looked and looked to find someone who'd be the perfect match. Didn't get the hair color, but otherwise, she got what she wanted. Lucky girl. She's passed on, now. Oh. Same thing that made her infertile eventually came back. I'm sorry. Took a me awhile before I decided to go looking. And then when I did, I realized no one was looking for me, which made it tougher. But I'm good at researching. I know you are. I always knew there was a mystery between us, our differences and why she called me Runa. There was a hidden story there, which is probably why I got into journalism. So I kept looking. When you say looking... For the perfect match. I'm really sorry, I have to go. It was back in '88, though they didn't end up doing it for another few years. They tried and tried, and then it worked. And they got me. From you. I didn't know if you wanted to know. I had to be certain. I already had a great mom and I didn't wanna ruin it, if somebody didn't want me. I checked your DNA to be certain. I stole your Band-Aid. Sorry. My arm has to heal so that I can hold you properly. It will. Injury, not age, right? Yeah What does Runa mean? It means secret. Now I have some questions for you. Wait a minute, I can't leave. You have to go. No way. Dan? - Dan. - You rang? Wait, I need my phone. - Where's my purse? - Wait a minute. - You can't do this. - What, yes, I can. - Your bags in the car. - Give me your phone. - No, no. - Okay. - It's gonna be fine. - Look, what's happening here? This is my daughter. Say hello. Wait a minute. What? Yes, and I'm coming off the road and I'm staying at the house and I need a phone. No, this tour's gonna start - a whole new career for you. - I don't care. - I do. - I'm not leaving you. It's okay. This is the story I wanted to tell. Since I just became an honorary uncle here, I vote stay. - Yes. - No. You have to go. You're a director now. Okay, but if we're gonna fly, we've gotta fly, now. - Come on, come on. - Wait, no, no, don't, no. It's okay. I'll be here when you get back.
