[Newscaster] And tonight on the national report, our topic is hate crimes in America and their link to international terrorism. Recently, interpol alerted local authorities to the ever-widening influence of international terrorist groups and their intent to disrupt our nation. With its numerous points of entry, California appears to have become the primary testing ground for these hate groups. Tonight... [Man] The white race has been oppressed. Are we going to tolerate this? [Crowd] No! [Man] No, we are not! It's time to take back our schools, our streets, and make our once-great nation clean again! [Cheering] [Man] Thank you for believing in our cause. Thank you for believing that we must act now before the white race is totally diluted in this cesspool we see swirling around us. Already two more of our brothers have been chosen to strike yet another blow, a blow to display our immense power! Soon we will no longer have to tolerate the further degeneration of our supreme white race! That-a boy. All right. Give me five. Yeah. You're going to be late for school. You better hustle, Matt. Can Reno have a jelly roll, grandpa? Please. O.k. Just one. All right. There you go. Bye. Bye, Reno. All right. [Police radio transmissions] Hey, cut it out, Reno! [Growling] Come on! You've ruined every scarf I own! You're not going to get this one. Oh, damn! [Dispatcher] Any units vicinity of bay area, respond to explosion and structural fire at 2225 harbor drive. Fire and rescue units en route. 1187, Nora. I'm on my way. [Siren] [Sirens and horns honking] [Man] Fire around on Wilson! Everybody get out, Harry? Yeah, I sure as hell hope so, Lou. Looks like another bombing. This will make the fourth this month. Lady says her baby's still inside... Second floor, south end. Maybe we could help. O.k., Lou. Be careful. Rescue 455, report of a child still inside at end apartment, second floor, south end. Can you get in there? Over. Have to get the kid through the roof, chief. It's coming down. Lou, this place is not safe. Reno, no! Reno, come! [Whining] Come down! That's a direct order! [Baby crying] Get out of here! Get out of here! [Firefighter] I can hear him, but I can't see him, chief. [Baby crying] I got to go back in. I'm sorry, Lou. It's too dangerous in there. Chief! The dog's got the baby! [Baby crying] Oh, my. [Woman] My baby! My baby! Is he o.K.? Saved the baby's life, Reno. Great job. You'll probably get another commendation. [Police radio] Suspects in park. 12 hispanics, possible gang activity. You still disobeyed a direct order. I'm putting you on official report. I don't care if you get a medal. There'll be no jelly rolls for three days. Get it? Three days. Reno, look at that. Harry said a neighbor spotted two guys leaving the building just before the explosion. Those two guys match his description. I wonder. [Starts engine] [Newscaster] The fire in a downtown San Diego tenement building is now reported to be under control. Already one radical white supremacist organization is claiming responsibility for the crime. This would be the fourth... I think you better plan on some overtime tonight, Reno. Go to work, Reno. Sniff it out. [Thud] C-4. My god. There's enough stuff here to blow up half the country. [Reno growling] [Sniffing] What have you got here? Huh? Uh! My god. [Growling] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Hold it. I'm a cop. I don't care. [Reno falls] Get rid of them both. [Telephone rings] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] Yeah. [Man] Wilder! How come it takes you so damn long to answer your telephone? I'm still on suspension, captain. You're lucky I even answered it. Wilder? Jake! Ohh... [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] Oh, god. [Ring] What? Your suspension is over. I want you in here right now. I thought you told me you'd be retired and campaigning for mayor before I got back in. Believe me, that was my plan, pal. What changed it? Well, you heard Lou got it last month. Yeah. He was a good cop. We haven't been able to set any leads, Jake. I want you in on it. O.k. I'm on my way. Back from vacation a little early, huh, lieutenant? [Man] I wasn't even there, all right? You got nothing to hold me on. Hey, man. I know my rights here. Sit your rights down. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Uh... Ha ha ha ha! What's so funny? What... Jeez, Jake. What? Never mind. Listen to this. "During the past 24 months, "lieutenant Wilder... 118 arrests, "116 convictions. "Sergeant Reno... 118 arrests, "116 convictions. "Wilder... Six citations for bravery. Reno... Six citations for bravery." Wow! Both of you have been shot five times in the line of duty. It's unbelievable. I've never heard of this sergeant Reno. Oh, you will. Oh, this is great. "Wilder... Four suspensions for insubordination. Reno... four suspensions for disobeying direct orders." What is this all about? Well, I'm just comparing your file to your partner's. It's amazing similarities here. Hold on. What partner? You know I always work alone. Well, not this time, Jake. [Man] Hey! Someone stole my jelly doughnut. Meet your new partner, Jake. Her? No. Him. Wait a minute. If I'm not going to work with a man... A woman... What makes you think I'm going to work with a mutt? Who is this guy? Don't take it personal, detective boyette. Wilder doesn't like anyone. Thanks, detective. That's all. No doubt about it. You boys are made for each other. I don't care what he's done. I'm not working with a damn dog. [Growls] Don't growl at me. You don't even look like a police dog. Get off me, you reject from the dog pound! Grr, yourself, mutt! You don't scare me! Both of you, shut up! Sit! Good dog. Good Jake. Now, both of you are going to work together. That's an order. Lou's notebook. [Reno whines] It says here he followed two suspects from the fire on harbor drive to the docks. He must have spotted the guys at the fire. You think there's any connection? Maybe. Now, two things we know for sure... The building was the Martin Luther King minority housing project, and the building was targeted. Arson said that several explosions caused the fire. C-4. Heavy stuff. Now, they pulled this out of Lou's pocket after they fished him out. Could have come from a ship around there. Hmm... C-4. Middle-east stuff. How'd you know that? We cover ours with tin. They wrap theirs. Not much to go on. Well, maybe. Maybe not. What do you mean? Well, we have an eyewitness. Oh, give me a break. What's he going to be able to do? Three down... One to go. [Barking] Aargh! Aargh! [Clanging] [Barking] Oh! Ugh! Ugh! Goddamn mutt! You're not doing it right! [Crashing] Oh, wait, wait! [Barking] My legs! My legs! Is he, um... He'll be all right. Aah! I'm not working with that dog again! That's not the way he was trained. He cheats. Look at my outfit. Look at my suit. [Boyette] Reno's an exception. He's been cross-trained to find almost every known narcotic and explosive there is. He can disarm and take out an assailant quicker than either one of us. Do you think you can handle it? Sure. Just another tool. A what? A tool. You know, like my gun and my handcuffs. Did you ever hear the saying "you can't teach an old dog new tricks"? Yeah. Why? It doesn't just apply to old dogs. What's she so mad about? [Barks] You know how you start a revolution, Charlie? With just one bullet. Pow! And we're sitting right on top of that bullet. [Man] Ma'am, move your vehicle. Damn! Checkpoint. Stay calm. Don't panic. Where are you gentlemen headed today? San Diego. Looking for some hazardous materials. Had some problems in San Diego. You fool. Why didn't you tell me about this checkpoint? They never stopped me before. They'll search the car. Get me out of here. The cops have been tipped off. Relax. Relax? We've got enough c-4 to blow up the state. Pull it over to the side, please. Just a routine check. [Man] Please move forward, sir. We got a runner! Let's go! Come on! Hurry up! [Sirens] Hang on! Looks like we found some gunrunners. Guns and a whole lot of explosives. Clear the area! Hey, careful! There could be some live ammo out here. [Reno barks] All right, all right! I don't know why I have to drive Lou's old car just to please this damn dog. What a pigpen. Jeez! O.k. This is your new home, so don't mess it up. [Whines] [Sniffs] Uh... [Sniffs] Hmm. I sure wish I knew where you guys went that night. Is this it? You dragged me over here to see an empty berth? Ohh... I think I know what you're trying to tell me. Lieutenant Wilder, sheriff's department. I want to take a look at your logbook. Do you have a warrant? You got a problem? [Barking] [Growling] [Sniffing] [Growling] Come on, Reno. I said, "come on!" That's that dog. Kill them both. Here. Give me that. Give me that! Keep this filthy scarf out of my kitchen! Knock it off in there! Mmm, good! Mmm. [Ring] [Ring] Hello. Hi. This is officer boyette. I was just calling to see how you and Reno are doing. We're like two peas in a pod, officer boyette. What can I do for you this evening? I would appreciate if you would respect his abilities. Respect his abilities? He's a dog, for crying out loud. Do you mind if I come by to see Reno? Be my guest. I'll be by in a couple of minutes. Fine. You ate my chicken, you mangy mutt. [Belch] What am I supposed to eat? Damn dog. Now you're in my chair. You've got an attitude problem. [Doorbell rings] Damn dog. Who does he think he is, anyway? Are you lieutenant Wilder? That's right. I'd like to see my dog. Oh, hey, Reno! Good, boy. Hey, boy! Come in. Have you been eating chicken? What are you doing about my grandpa? I'm not sure I understand. 187 you're supposed to be working on. What's your name, son? Matthew Swanson. So you're Lou Swanson's grandkid. How did you know I was working on his case? I have contacts downtown. Captain Callahan's a good friend of mine. I'm sure he is. I'm going to find out what happened to your grandfather. Trust me. I do. Now who? Hi. Hey, Matthew! How you doing? Hey, Reno! Anybody else? You actually live here? Yeah. Why? This place isn't fit for a dog. You know, you're right. You're absolutely right. So why don't you take this mutt home, and I'll pick him up every morning and bring him home every night. Reno is not a mutt. He is a highly qualified and highly decorated police officer. I'll keep him. I'm afraid Reno has to stay here, Matthew. Lieutenant Wilder needs the experience. I better go before my mom has a fit. [Reno whines] Can I come back and see Reno again? Yeah. Sure. What? He has to go to the bathroom. Oh. Reno seems to be doing real well. Like I told you, two peas in a pod. What made you decide to work with dogs in the first place? You make it sound like a put-down. I didn't mean it... In the house! Stay down! Huh? Help me! Ugh! Ah! Ah! Come back! Ah! Cover me. Ugh! Come on. Huh? Ugh! Uh-oh. Aaah! [Sirens wailing] [Snarling] If he moves, Reno, bite that smile off his face. [Honk] Oh! You're under arrest, bozo. Oh. Hey, Reno! How ya doin'? [Reno whimpers] Ho ho ho ho! [Whimper] Aw, I forgot. Dessert! Uh, hey, uh... two bucks. What? Two bucks, with the discount. Nothing's too good for Reno. That dog's a hero, you know. Yeah, so I've been told. Heard about last night. Good collar, Reno. Ha ha ha! Jake, ballistics just called. They couldn't match the weapons you recovered from slugs the coroner took out of Lou. Good job last night, Reno. Something else. Atf sent these over. Two guys tried to slip through the immigration checkpoint yesterday. What happened? Border patrol literally blew them away. Rounds from the officers set off a couple hundred pounds of c-4. Hell of an explosion. Those photos were found in the car. [Knocking] Excuse me. Hi, Reno. Jake, we've got a make on three of the four guys you nailed last night. All three of these guys have been arrested for assault and disturbing the peace several times. They've walked every single time. They're also members of a racist group in this area. I bet the fourth guy is, too. Jake, listen, I really have a good feeling about this case. You could let me go undercover, and I could shave my head and infiltrate the organization. I could fit in. What do you think? We'll think about it. Oh. O.K. Thanks. You'll think about it. You know, I could really do this case a lot of good. Wonder what she'd look like with a shaved head. This thing's really heating up. You recognize that building? No. It's the headquarters of the naacp in Washington. The other is a synagogue in Los Angeles. We think there were a lot more photographs that were burned. "We shall rise again." What? It says on this photograph, "we shall rise again." Oh, Jesus. Two guys carrying explosives trying to bust through immigration, hitmen trying to nail you were carrying explosives, and the stuff Lou found... My campaign for mayor's not looking so good. [Whimpering] Wonder what he's dreaming about. I'm a cop. I don't care. [Man yelling] Lock... And load! This is a miss! That... Is a hit! O.k. Let's do it. A hit! You've done well, Otto. Thank you. [Reno whimpering] All right. Come on. And mind your manners. Hey, mom. Well, hi there. Hello there. Oh! Is that your new partner? Yeah. His name's Reno. You want me to put these away for you, mom? Oh, yes. Oh, no. Leave them right there. Thank you. Get lost, Benji! Mom, is something bothering you? Oh, Jacob. Jacob. Jacob. I'm worried about you. There's nothing to worry about. Oh, but... but all this violence. I can take care of myself, mom. I had a good teacher. Ooh... Yes. Yes, you did. I'll see you later, mom. [Whistles] Come on, Reno. [Man screams] What was that? It was probably the repairman fooling around with the TV. [Repairman] Damn dog! [Reno climbing into car] Bye, mom. ♪ What you gonna do? ♪ What you gonna do when they come for you? ♪ ♪ Bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do? ♪ ♪ What you gonna do when they come for you? ♪ ♪ Bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do? ♪ ♪ What you gonna do when they come for you? ♪ Cops is filmed on location with the men and women of law enforcement.

Waiting for k9s to check the house. Joint's probably loaded with dope. Hey, isn't that Reno, Lou Swanson's old dog? Yeah. Man, that dog is some kind of hero. Yeah, so I've been told... More than once. Do me a favor, Jake. We've been waiting an hour for a dog. Can I use Reno a few minutes? He's the best sniffer in k9. Yeah, I guess so. All right. It's all yours, Jake. O.k., find the drugs, Reno. Go find the dope, Reno. Look, guys, uh, Reno can't concentrate with you in here. You mind stepping outside? Concentrate? Yeah. Oh. O.K., Jake. If that's what, uh, he needs to work, huh? Yeah, that's what he needs. I wish you guys could see Reno work. Man, that dog is incredible! Reno. Marijuana, cocaine, heroin. Go find it. Listen, you damn dog, I'll blow your head off! That's more like it. O.k., find the drugs, Reno. That-a boy. You'll find it. Yeah. Please find it. O.k., boy. [Reno grunts] Did you find something? Good boy! O.k., Reno. I'll take over. Get out of here, Reno. Arggh! Hey, the dog's found someone. [Sighs] Could have warned me. Arggh! Ugh! You could help. [Grunt] Reno! You're pissing me off. Enough of this. Ho ho ho ho! Reno's really got him now. What a dog, eh? All right! Hey, hey, hey! What a dog! Jake. Hey, Mark. How you doing? Going to the dogs, huh? Don't you start it, too. What time's the meeting? In 10 minutes. We'd better get over there. Look at this report on the way over. Reno, stay. All right, people. Let's settle. Everyone take a seat. [Coughing] First, I want to remind everyone that, whereas this is a local homicide investigation, we can't afford to overlook anything. We don't know what sergeant Swanson stumbled onto before he was killed, but it's starting to look like a major conspiracy. Lieutenant Wilder will head the task force, and I've asked lieutenant curtains from our SWAT unit to attend this meeting. Mark? Well, since last night, we've had 14 reports of hate crimes coming in from all over the country. There's more coming in every hour, and it seems that all the incidents are connected to hate groups. I'm sure this fast-growing white supremacist movement is only the tip of the iceberg. Be aware, we can tolerate no more mistakes in this operation. Thanks to the efforts and support of Mr. Koller here, for the first time, we have the opportunity to unite our front-line warriors throughout this country. If we are successful in this mission, we will bring together every group in the United States that supports our cause. Our next attack will show to the world we have risen again! Interpol informed me this morning that underground shipments of weapons and explosives have been moving rapidly throughout Europe and here in the United States. Many things point to San Diego. The financial trail and the boat Jake identified lead to a fleet of fishing boats owned by a known activist and white supremacist movement supporter, Karl koller. The anti-defamation league monitors racist movements throughout the country. They helped locate a manufacturing plant on the West Side which is the headquarters and regular meeting place of a white supremacist group. Koller owns the plant. What do you think, Mark? Koller's been on the scene for every major racist attack all over the world... Africa, Europe, Asia. He loves the stuff. Now he's here in San Diego. It's going down, guys. What we got to find out is when and where. With a single blow in San Diego, we can unite the ku klux klan, Aryan nations, white Aryan resistance, the church of the creator, and many others. In a single blow, we can initiate the movement which will sanitize this country for generations! We must succeed! We willsucceed! Victory! Victory! Victory! Jakey! Good. You're here. Hi, mom. I hope you don't have anything to do right now. I'm kind of busy today, mom. Oh, but it'll only take a second. Just so you carry the plants out to the back yard for me. O.k. Jake, where is Reno today? Matthew took him to the dog show. [Announcer on loudspeaker] [Matthew] Jake told me to keep a close eye on you, so behave yourself. Third place, best in show... Sherlock, for poise and character. Second place, best in show... From the Winchester kennels, pookie, for talent and grooming. [Matthew] Reno? Reno! And finally, first place, best in show, goes to... Ahh! That's not mittens! Get that darn mutt out of here! Come back! Grab that dog! Whoo! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Huh? Whoa! Nah! Nah! Yes! [Engine revs] How is the investigation going? Uh, not too good. All I know is that there's a group of Neo-Nazis out there who are planning to hit something big here in San Diego. I just don't know where or when. He was an art student, you know. Who? Hitler. I know that if I was one of those nuts that wants to blow up buildings and kill all those people, I'd probably do it tomorrow. Why tomorrow? It's Hitler's birthday. April 20th. Are you sure? 'Course I'm sure. It's in all the history books. Thanks, mom. Wha... Jacob, what about the tree? Oh, no! Look at that. Oh! That's got to be the date. They've had time to put everything into place. I'll notify the FBI. That doesn't give us much time, even if we knew the targets. Did you get the search warrant on the manufacturing plant? I'll check on it. Jake, I've got my squad standing by, waiting for you to give the word. It's tomorrow, Mark. I'm sure of it. I just don't know where. Warrant's not ready. Let me know when it comes in. Pick up every racist scumbag in the area. Maybe someone will know something. [Men yelling] Looks like Jake. It is. Hi, Jake. Got the warrant? It didn't come through. What do you mean, "it didn't come through"? They said something about probable cause. Well, I'm going in anyway. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, call for backup. You can't go in without a warrant. It's 4 A.M. we're running out of time. He's crazy. Come on, Reno. Let's go. I had a dog once, you know, when I was a kid. Had him for 12 years. Used to hunt... Do everything together. Want you to understand, Reno... You're a good cop and all that, but that's where it ends. O.k.? [Reno whimpering] [Reno panting] Shh! [Reno grunts] What is it, Reno? [Grunting] I should have known. What? There's nothing in here. We've got it. Let's get out of here, Reno. It's been 20 minutes. What do you think? We'd better check. Call it in. Right. Aah! [Reno snarling] Get out of here, Reno! Get that notebook back and kill that dog! Get him! You check down there. I'll go this way. [Sighs] [Man panting] [Ruff] Huh? Aah! Aah! [Gagging and coughing] 1122 Nora. I need a 10-20 on 1192 delta. [Woman] 1122 Nora, stand by. [Punches being thrown] He won't talk. It doesn't matter now anyway. The men are leaving. Kill him. We have to leave. When those two idiots kill that dog, make sure you destroy the notebook. Then meet us at the park. [Growling] Nice dog. Ha ha ha! [Rattling] Huh? Aah! [Police radio transmissions] 1122 Nora. We have 2 police officers down. [Ring] Yeah. Where? Where's Wilder now? O.k. I'll be there. What's wrong? Well, my retirement and campaign for mayor's going down the drain, that's what's wrong. Love you. You cops all think you're so tough! [Lands punch] We are! [Punches] And there is no place for people like you in our new order, and if I had more time, I'd cut you loose and break your neck with my bare hands. Be my guest. How unfortunate. There's no more time! I am going to enjoy this. I'm going to enjoy this. Thanks, Reno. You saved my butt. Oh, my god, Jake! What happened to you? Never mind. Never mind. Koller mentioned a park. Balboa park. The coalition for racial unity opens this morning. That's it! Let's go! Oh, my god. [Tires screeching] Call Callahan. Tell him the target is the organ pavilion at balboa park. The other targets are in this folder. Attention, all k9 units. Requesting assistance at balboa park. This is a code-three Alpha. I repeat, a code-three Alpha. Have curtains get his men down there immediately. I'm on my way. Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to work we go. Let's lock and load, guys. I'm going out for a while, mom! O.k., but don't be gone long! Lay it down right over here! Testing. [Feedback] Testing. Testing. 1, 2, 3. Testing. Testing. Testing. Yes. I understand you made a special trip down here today. Absolutely. [Sirens] The men are all in place. The other targets will arrive soon. [Mariachi band playing] Your eminence. Do you have any comments? Hello! How did the three of you come to interact on this? [Tires screech] [Barks] Sorry about that. We can't wait for the other targets to get here. Signal your men to set the timer. I'm getting out of here. Lieutenant Wilder, sheriff's department! There's a bomb somewhere. Get him out of here! [People screaming] [Wilder] Come here, Reno. Find the bomb, Reno. Find the bomb. Watch your head. You'll be safe in the limo. [Beeping] Koller! I'll get him. Oh, hell. Come on, Reno! Open the door! Won't open! It's locked! [Rapid beeping] What's going on, Jake? The doors won't open. The bomb's got to be on the limo. Find the bomb, Reno. Need some help? Break the window! It must be bulletproof. [Gunshot] [Screaming] Get down! Get down! You all right? [Beep] Here's the bomb. [Beeping] Shit. Go! Go! Go! Go! Positions. [Growling] Aah! [Barks] Commence firing! This will blow. Get out! I'm staying. Can you disarm it? I don't know. I've never done anything like this before. Shit. Aah! How you doing? There's two wires down here... A red and a blue one. Which one do I pull? How the hell should I know? Aah! I give up! Don't shoot! [Beeping] 20 seconds. We got to make a choice! Pick the right one! Cease fire! Move in! Five seconds. Red or blue? Blue! Good guess. You never listen to me, thank god. Well... I guess we showed them. Get that door open. [Dog barking] Aah! Pull me in! Drop the gun! Pull me in! Pull me in! Drop the gun, or I'll drop you! [Clank] You're not so tough. Aah! Son of a bitch. My mom wouldn't like that. Enough playing around. [Barking] Call him off. He's going to kill me. Now, why would he want to do that? I don't know. Just get him away. Is there something you want to tell me? You're both crazy. Call him off. I would, but he never listens to me. O.k. O.K. I killed the cop. I admit it. Call the dog off. O.k., Reno. Reno! Reno. It's o.K., boy. Don't bite him. Might get sick. It's a good thing the kid got here, or you'd be dog food. Mark, congratulations. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Ken Callahan. I want you to meet lieutenant Mark curtains, the head of our s.W.A.T. Team. Through a concerted effort between our two departments, we have been able to crack this terrorist conspiracy, and, incidentally, everyone, I'm in the running for the mayoral nomination for this great city on the platform of law and order. Cuff him. Well, I have to admit it. Sergeant Reno is one hell of a good cop. I tried to tell you. Yeah, you did. Jake! Jake, you did it! You did it! I'm in definite contention for the mayor's race now. I want to thank you. It's o.K., Matt. There's somebody who wants to thank you for saving their lives. Detective. Yes, sir? Gentlemen, the lord was certainly good with us today. These good people helped us through this trouble.
