Hello. Who are you? - I'm Dr. Faraday. - Oh. I was expecting Granger. Roderick Ayres. It's one of your maids, I understand? One of our maids? I like that. Down the steps on your left. My sister will fill you in. Gyp. Gyp! Sorry. Shh. He thinks every stranger's come to cut our throats and make off with the last silver spoon. Dr. Faraday. Dr. Granger's new partner. Yeah. Caroline Ayres. Betty's this way. Hmm. Have you been sick at all, Betty? And is it a stabbing pain or a burning pain? It's like... a burning pain with stabs in it? Right. Let's have a look at you. Just relax. Ow. Ow! Ow! Could you leave us alone for a minute, please, Miss Ayres? Yes, of course. Come on, Gyp. Well? I did feel poorly. I did. And I just thought if I was bad enough... that they might send me home. What is it? Is the work too hard? Are they unkind to you? Then what is it? Shh. Nothing serious. She'll be fine by tomorrow. Ha. Well, thank you. There's one other thing. It's a very big house. Betty's alone down here at night. I was... These silly girls. You've lived here all your life, Miss Ayres. Perhaps you could reassure Betty. She's really awfully young. Right. Well, let's find Roderick. You can tell him how much we owe you. Rod? Roddie? How did you find the patient, Doctor? Mrs. Ayres? Uh, Mother, this is Dr. Faraday. He thinks we're brutes. Little under the weather. I imagine she'll be quite well by tomorrow. You'll observe a change in Betty yet. This house works on people. Girls come here like specks of grit. Ten years later, they leave as pearls. I expect Dr. Faraday's thinking Betty won't stick it out for ten years. Most girls would rather work in factories these days, and who can blame them? As it happens, I was thinking of my mother. She was a maid here before I was born. Well... I do hope she enjoyed her time. Right. Roderick. Come on, Gyp. Wait here, please. The first time I saw Hundreds Hall was July 1919... an Empire Day fete the summer after the Great War. I had passed by its gates often enough, never imagining they would open to me, a common village boy. There was bunting and cake and all manner of games. And at the heart of it, the Ayres family. So happy and handsome back then. But it was the house itself, still in its glory, which somehow impressed me terribly. My mother had described the place often. But seeing it myself for the first time, nothing could have prepared me for the spell it cast that day. Aren't you smart? Mummy. Nice and still, please. It won't be as bad as you think. I sincerely hope you aren't discussing supper. The National Health Service. Granger here will be all right. People like to look up to their doctors. Last thing they want is one of their own. Rubbish. They want someone who'll do the job. Besides, turns out you've friends in high places. - Peter said you'd been out to Hundreds. - Mm. - Can't believe I missed that call. -How was it? The place is a mess. I'd heard they were pigging it. Can't get tradesmen, too many unpaid bills. Roderick handed me the shillings as though they were his last. Oh, poor boy. One moment you're an Air Force hero, then captain of a sinking ship. He's still in a good deal of pain with his leg. Night, Rod. There was nervous trouble, too, apparently, when he came back. Hardly surprising. You didn't treat him? Family closed ranks. Very hush-hush about it. No, they brought Caroline home to nurse him. Rotten shame, really. She was doing very well, commission in the WAAF or the Wrens. Awfully brainy girl. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Gyp! Gyp! Come here. What on earth do you think you're doing? I'm terribly sorry... Oh. Oh, it's you. I'm sorry. I-I was racing a horse and cart. Well, no harm done, eh? At least, uh, he's alive and kicking. Here. I mean to pay my fare. What's wrong with the patient you're visiting? Whooping cough. Try to call in twice a day. Goodness. You must be rolling in it. He's a club patient. I treat the whole family for a few shillings a year. How's Betty? Ah, well, Rod fixed her up with a wireless. Miracle cure. Oh, look, I-I meant to say, the day you came we were ghastly, weren't we? - Not at all. - No, no, no, we were. We've lost the trick of company. Mother won't have guests with the house so shabby. Are your parents still in the county? My mother died some while ago, Father just last year. That's what brought me back, in fact. Come on, Gyp. That's it. You sure you won't come up? That's kind, but... Your patient. Well, Rod will be awfully jealous I had a ride. He loves your car. If you don't mind my saying, I'm surprised the RAF didn't make a better job of patching him up. Ah. Well, I'm not sure he wanted to be patched up. Hmm. Look, I know it's a cheek, but could you talk to him? I'm not a psychological doctor. No, he might listen to you. Sorry, shouldn't have asked. The matter of his leg. Might he be more open to treatment for that? Yes. I'll ask him. Thank you. Right. Come on, Gyp. That's it. Caroline tells me this is a favor. Oh, no. There's a mutual benefit. You get the treatment and I write it up. See, the accepted wisdom is that induction coils are only good for fresh injuries, but, uh, I've got a hunch. Good Lord, it's like something out of Frankenstein. It's not as dramatic as it looks, I promise you. So you work and sleep in here, then? Yes. When I first came home I couldn't be doing with stairs. I actually prefer it now. Helps me keep on top of things, you know. Difficult times for estates like Hundreds. With death duties at 75%? I'll say. Labour government won't be happy until we're begging for our lives on street corners. Perhaps you feel the same way, I don't know. Why would I? No. Do you mind? Anyway, I'm, uh, selling some land to the council. Selling land? Just some scrub behind the sheep sheds. Bring in some power and water to the farm, make a big difference to milking. Christ. Sit down, please. It's actually a very gentle sensation. It might take away a little of your pain. - Right. - May I? Yes. I wouldn't bother, except I'm just so slow about the place. Can't keep up with the men. Pretty foul, isn't it? I've seen worse. Not too bad, actually. Sort of hotting up. Huh. ♪ ♪ You're a wizard, Dr. Faraday. I really don't know how to thank you. Well, perhaps you'd consider this an act of restitution. A long time ago, as a grubby-kneed boy, I snuck up and stole something from this house. Really? One of your plaster acorns. Oh. Oh, but that's too funny. I don't know what came over me. I was such an obedient boy as a rule. Oh, no, but Roddie and I have snapped off hundreds of the silly, twiddly things. They were just asking to be vandalized. I wasn't intending to vandalize. I was overwhelmed by admiration. Like a man stealing a lock of hair from the girl he's fallen blindly in love with. Mother almost died of shame when she found out. - Did she make you own up? - Heavens, no. She burned it in the grate. We never spoke of it again, but I don't think she ever forgave me. Well, you're forgiven now. I forgive you. It is queer, isn't it? That you were here before Rod and me. There was a child here then. Susan. Susan died before I was born. - Yes. - Mummy. I'm afraid I was horribly jealous of her. She seemed to have such a charmed existence. One can't see into the future. Don't worry, Doctor. We're all jealous of Suki, not just you. Swallow. They should be gone by now. Are you off back to Lidcote? I have a patient in Edgworth, another in Hawthend. Why don't you cut across and use the east gate? It's much quicker. Do you know the way? I think so. And, look, would it help to use the park sometimes, as a shortcut? Thank you. The treatment continued to yield results over the weeks that followed, and a kind of relationship developed with poor Rod. I saw at close hand how utterly overwhelmed he was by the business of running Hundreds. I couldn't help feeling the house deserved better. And my heart went out to Caroline, in many ways so much more able, forced to watch its continued decline. I resolved to help her as much as I could. Miss Ayres, what brings you to town? Oh, Doctor. Well, uh, Rod and Mother are seeing the solicitor about the land sale. Thought I'd come for the ride. You never know when I'll get another chance. So, when she asked if I would make up the numbers at a small affair - to welcome new neighbors... - Oh, Caroline. - They've been invited over. - Can we manage? Well, we'll have to, won't we? Oh, Doctor, you'll come, too, won't you? It really did seem the least I could do. Hello? Betty. Um, I'm sorry, Doctor. Let me help. Everything's jumpy tonight. Betty! Are you all right? Oh, Doctor. Welcome. Forgive me. I rang, but... Afraid I've been pinning the house back together. So I see. My darling brother's still in Lidcote, arguing with the builder about the land sale. I do hope they're not drinking to seal the deal. Ah, speaking of which, help yourself. If there are any glasses left. Pay no attention. And I think you look very smart, Betty. Oh, I should warn you... The acoustics in this room are uncanny. Every word carries. You, Miss Ayres, look beautiful. He hasn't touched a drop yet, Gyp. Pour for me, too, would you? One would have hoped the weather might have held off. Sadly, no. Mr. and Mrs. Rossiter - and Miss... - Dabney. My dear. - How are you? - Quite well. - Oh, Edith, you look wonderful. - Nice to see you. Thank you. - Oh, Caroline. -Hello, Edith, how nice to see you. Good evening. Nice to see you. Perhaps you know our Dr. Faraday. - Good evening. -MR. ROSSITER: Oh, I... I hope no one's unwell. Oh, no. The doctor is a guest. Ah. One of us. Will Roderick be joining us this evening? Gillian! I hope no one minds. Darling, it's only a dog. This way, please. Mr. and Mrs. Baker-Hyde and Mr. Morley. Now behave. You're not supposed to be here. - Good boy. - Well, my mother grew up here, so I knew the area well as a child. And, of course, my brother's with us most weekends. Perhaps he should move up here. - If only I didn't have to work. - Come back. What is it you do, Mr. Morley? I'm in the ad business. An accountant? No, advertising. It's an American outfit. Ah, America. - Hmm. - Gyp, come here. Oh, gentlemen, please sit down. - Oh, thank you. - Mr. Morley. Uh, uh, Dr. Faraday, would you be a lamb and see if Roderick will join us? Of course. Have you come far this evening, Miss Dabney? Roderick. Roderick. I'm not coming. Tell Mother I'm sorry. Look, Rod, put your drink down. Just get dressed. You're the man of the house. I've told you... I won't. - For God's sake... - I can't. I've got a bad feeling, Faraday. A very bad feeling. - Christ, don't you? - Stop. Stop that nonsense. Stop it at once. Now get dressed. Have you traveled much? Well, I wanted to... Gyp, wait! Why won't he come and play with me? He won't stay still. Well, perhaps you should stay still. Gillian, darling. Goodness. Is that allowed? Well, I don't believe in rules just for the sake of them. Breeds all sorts of neuroses. You don't want them getting a complex. - I never go to bed before midnight. -Ah. And I once smoked a cigarette. - I hardly think Dr. Faraday would approve of that. No. But then my mother was very hot on rules. And it hasn't done him any harm. Gillian, look at that beautiful piano. It's a spinet, you philistine. Actually, it's a Flemish virginal. Do play us something, Tony. - Gyp. -As long as it's not too old and fragile. Come on. - Let's see. - See, we're friends now. Gillian, dear, please leave that poor dog alone. Where is Roderick? He'll be, he'll be with us shortly. He's rather overdone it at the farm. Mm. What a lovely sound. It is, isn't it? It's very light. ♪ ♪ Oh, that's it. - Good boy. -MRS. AYRES: Caroline used to love playing. ♪ ♪ He does play awfully well. Yes, he does. Such a gentle dog. I had no idea the son was so bad. That why they keep you on hand? I'm a guest here, like you. Oh, no, pal. I'm just making up the numbers while my wife and our hostess try matchmaking. I don't like their chances. Tony may be a prize ass, but he likes a pretty face. ♪ ♪ Gillian. What is it? Gillian! - Gyp, Gyp, come back. - Gillian! ♪ ♪ You can't mean to treat her here! It's nine miles to the nearest hospital. Open the door. Open the door! Clear the table. It's all right. - Please. - Hold her still. Betty, I need boiling water. - Hold her still. - Please. Hold that there. Hold that there. Shh, darling. - Shh. -Mrs. Baker-Hyde might want to wait upstairs. No, I'm staying! Diana, do as he says. Diana... come on. Betty, make sure they're getting blankets. ♪ ♪ Bloody dog should be shot. Shh. ♪ ♪ The child will be terribly marked, won't she? I don't understand why they had to bring her. Surely they have a nurse or a governess. Probably think a governess would give her a complex. Well, she'll have a complex now, won't she? Oh, Caroline. Good night. ♪ ♪ I tried to tell you. Didn't I? ♪ ♪ Miss Caroline's downstairs. Came as soon as you could, then. We might have taken this to court, you know. I should have found the money somehow. With the child so injured, it wouldn't be decent. Take him. Everything else has gone. Why not take him, too? Caroline. Get away, you stupid dog. God. Shh. Shh. Good dog. Walk away, Faraday. Distance yourself from the whole damn mess. Eh, the leg treatment must be almost finished. Write up what you've already done. Surely that's enough. Seriously. People like the Ayres... they'll run you bloody ragged if you let them. ♪ ♪ Yes. The problem is your heart, Mrs. Ravensdale. It's not doing its job properly, and that's causing the shortness of breath and the swelling. Couldn't be something I've eaten? I'm afraid not. John. Mrs. Evans. Come through, please. Alfie, come on. Leave it. Leave it! Go on! Go on, I'll catch you up. He's had enough, hasn't he? Blasted thing. Please sit down. Thank you. So... Hmm. I just signed a contract with Babb, you see. The land sale? That is good news. Yes. Yes, we ought to hang out the flags. The men are cock-a-hoop, of course. How are the mighty fallen, hey? Just think how much better things will be now. Hmm. But they won't. Come on, I'm sure they will. Don't say that, Faraday. You don't know what you're talking about. I should catch them up, it's my round. You'd be surprised how much of my job is just listening to people. - Hell. - Rod. Why don't you tell me what's going on? I've been concerned about you. You wouldn't believe me. Of course I will. And I'm a doctor. Anything you tell me is in the strictest confidence. There's a thing in that house. A thing? It hates me. It always has. And ever since that awful night with the girl... Go on. It wants me gone. I'm telling you. Dr. Faraday. Oh. Doctor. - Were we expecting you? - Forgive me. I was visiting a patient in the area. We've had a leak in the morning room. Got in the cupboards. Oh, my brothers. Doctor, look. Within six months of this, the fighting had started and they were lost. Suki. Like sweethearts, she and I. You're right to be touched by this scene, Doctor. This was my little girl's last happy day. By night she was already quite ill. Mother. I've boxed up some old books to give to the Red Cross. I wonder if Dr. Faraday might take them to Lidcote in his car. Of course. Betty. I, uh... - I feel awkward coming. - No, don't. I'm so glad you did. I've just seen Rod in Lidcote. Oh, God, is he in a bad way? I'm concerned about his state of mind. You're not the only one. Last night he came up to my room so upset. He said he could smell smoke, and I couldn't smell anything. It's like there's a hoodoo on him. It's nothing like that. War shock. We must keep it from Mother. The land sale's already too much to bear. I'm inclined to agree. God knows how she'll cope when Babb knocks down the wall. Why on earth would Babb need to knock down a wall? Well, they wouldn't take the pasture. Didn't Rod say? They'd only take the grass-snake field. Surely you can't mean to break up the park? There must be some alternative. - Believe me, he tried. - The sale must be stopped. - What? - Rod's not of sound mind. - This can be overturned. - Ah! Doctor. What's he been telling you? That I'm cracked? No. Of course not, Roddie. So much for confidentiality. Rod. Rod. I hadn't understood about the land sale. Rod. - This is terribly serious. - Damn right. The mob will be at our door any moment. Cutlasses between their teeth. You ought not to worry, Doctor. You are from pirate stock. Rod. Oh, yes. There'll be tricks tonight. For God's sake, look at yourself. You're afraid. You can feel it. Can't you? I'm sorry. Rod's in no fit state to be making irrevocable decisions. You can feel it now? - You can feel it. - I'm going to ask Dr. Granger - for a second opinion. - Goddamn. Who the fucking hell are you? This is my house, and I'll do as I like with the damn place! And it isn't any business of yours! What are you doing here? You're not part of this family. You are no one. - Now get out! - Rod, please don't. Get out of my house! ♪ ♪ Please leave us. What do you want? I've tried to warn them, I've tried. They wouldn't listen to me, please! You've got to leave! Just leave us, please! Betty. Betty! Roddie, open the door. Roddie! I should never have left him here last night. You placed your trust in me. I let you down. I shan't do so again. Rod, Dr. Warren's here. I'm sorry, Caroline. It's too strong for me. Rod. A trip in a Humber... What a treat. That's good. There. Mrs. Ayres? Oh. I hope it's not too dry. Looks perfect. - Thank you. - Caroline. It does seem a shame Betty isn't here. But how nice for her father to have her home for Christmas. Mm. Aren't you smart? Thanks for coming today. We'd have never survived these last few months without you and Betty. Would have been a grim day with Rod's chair empty. Christmas is generally grim for aging bachelors. I was very glad of an invitation - that didn't make me feel like a charity case. -God, no. We're the charity case. You were looking at the photograph? Mm. You know I'm in it? No. Oh, where? Where? Can't see you. That's the shoulder of my jacket. Oh. Ah. Upstaged by Susan. Just like the rest of us. It was a grand day otherwise. Shall we have tea to warm up? Yes. And why don't I make it? You stay there. Doctor's orders. Tom! Come inside. Sweetie. The house itself was out of bounds, of course. - wander off, do what you like. - Elizabeth! But as luck would have it, Mother still had friends among the staff. - How are you? - And so, miraculously, it came to pass. I was admitted. I'm afraid I was spoiled thoroughly and given the most fantastic treats. It was any small boy's dream. It made me feel, just for that moment, a part of the life of the house. Perhaps that explains, to some degree, at least, what happened next. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ My smart clothes that day were all borrowed or begged, but there, in that grand hall filled with marvelous things... I could not help imagining that I belonged. A proper little gentleman. Course, I was no such thing. What are you doing there? Get over here! What are you doing? I left behind all such ambitions that day. I don't want to hear a word out of you. Come with me right now. Funny. A small thing so many years ago. Yet the memory's quite fresh. Sit up, please, Alan. Hmm? Chin up. Now let's see if there's been any improvement. Open if you can. Open. Can you see who it is, Alan? Well, well, well. How wonderful. - Thank you. - Good. Good Lord. 24 houses in both fields, most of them already spoken for. - What a terrible shame. - Oh. I don't know. - People have to live somewhere. - Dr. Faraday? - Ah. - Mr. Babb. I knew you'd be down, Miss Ayres. Every day like clockwork. She puts my foreman to shame. I've promised Dr. Faraday the tour. Right, well, come on, then. So, uh... a lounge. - Hmm. - Fitted kitchen. Gas stove, electric points. Bathroom with a built-in tub. Gosh. Think what a difference this would make to people. There'll be nothing to beat these in the way of air and drainage. You're right about the houses. My mother would have liked one. She might be alive and living in one if she hadn't worked herself into an early grave to get me an education. I'm sure she was very proud of you. Your father, too. All I learned was to be ashamed of them. God, what an utter wet blanket I'm being. You must be wishing I hadn't called by. No, not at all. I'm grateful. It gets so lonely sometimes without Roddie. These short days don't help. They just make me want to get out. - Out where? - Yeah, well, I'm not fussy. You know, just to be where people are for a while. When you say you're not fussy...? Right. I want all the scandal. Who's killed the most patients, which doctors are going to bed with which nurses. - Faraday. - Ah, Bland. You can't be thinking of taking that down unadulterated. Here. Fresh from the test tube. - No... -I don't... - Ah. Hmm. Cheers. Ah, Faraday, well done on that paper of yours. Hope it goes down well in London. Thank you, Hewitt. That's kind of you. Goodness, you're quite the somebody. - London? - Not at all. And I haven't even accepted the invitation yet. Gosh, why wouldn't you? Come on, let's find you someone to dance with. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. They'll all be longing for a turn with some pretty young nurse. You and I can dance, can't we? Mm-hmm. I suddenly feel nervous. Close your eyes. - Oh, you dance very well. - You, too. My father taught me when I was small. Am I talking too much? Talk all you like. What are you grinning about? - You look like a dancer in a contest. - Have they pinned a number to your back? Ooh, there's Dr. Seeley. Look at his bow tie. Whiz me around so you can take a look. Do you know he's nicknamed The Octopus? Always terribly keen to give girls a lift home. Hands everywhere. Faraday! Ah, Caroline, you know, uh, David Granger. - Oh, yes. - Hello. - And this is Anne Gra... yeah. - Anne Granger. - Caroline Ayres. - Lovely to meet you. - You, too. -Oh, let me introduce our friend - Bre... - Brenda? - Oh. - I can't believe it. Oh, gosh, Brenda and I knew each other years ago. Back in the war. How are you? No introduction required. Good to see Caroline out and about. She's a super girl. Ladies and gentlemen, please take the floor for Paul Jones. - Shall we? - Now don't be shy. - Here's your chance to join her. Come on. -No. - Come on, Faraday. - No. - In for a penny. - All right. Ladies on the outside. - Oh. - Gosh, hello. This is murder! Oh! Oh. Oh, it is. Hello, Seeley. How are you? - Looking as pretty as a picture. -Thank you. Here we go. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Nights like this, I feel my age. Good dancer, Caroline Ayres. She's got hips and she knows what to do with them. Pity she hasn't the looks to match. Don't let that stop you. Girl like that needs an outlet. Oh, come on. Everyone knows how much time you've been spending out there. Do they indeed? I'm telling you, Faraday, make your move tonight before that fool in the horn-rimmed glasses makes his. Valerie, darling. - Seeley, I heard you were here. - Have you been ignoring me? Now, you promised me... Shall I light you one? - I can light my own. - Oh, come on. Let me... like they do in the pictures. No, no, no. Hands on the wheel. It's icy, remember? There. Don't much like Brenda. I'd never have guessed. Think she thought you and I were at it. You know. Hope you put her swiftly right. Did you? I told her the truth. A friend of the family being kind. God. My feet are perished. Ugh. Oh, gosh. It's not long now. I don't want to go home. Take me somewhere else, can't you? - It's past 2:00. - Care for a walk? In dancing shoes? Please, Faraday, I don't want to go home yet. Oh, my God. - Mmm. - Sorry. Sorry. Can't, can't. No, can't! Can't! Can't! God's sake. I thought you wanted to. So did I. I can't. Wait. Caroline, please, Caroline, wait. After approximately 15 minutes of the current being applied to the leg, the patient's pulse rate rose, as had been anticipated, and there was a slight fall in blood pressure. There was no pain associated with the procedure, and afterwards a marked increase in general mobility of the joint was observed. Positive effects diminished over time. Yes, we've got some really interesting work here. You should think about staying on. I'm flattered they asked, but... Mmm. So, where did you train? Up in Birmingham. Stayed on there for a while. Then got seconded to a military hospital in Plymouth after we pulled out of Dieppe. - Must have been busy. - Hellish. I'm at a practice in Warwickshire now. It's a backwater, really. Cheers. So, uh, are you a family man, or...? No. Well, for heaven's sake, move to London. What's stopping you? Charles, don't you think Faraday should move to London? I think it's a fine idea, yeah. Yes? Welcome back. Is everything all right? Absolutely. Just... curious about how it went. The bright lights, all that? Yes. Interesting. Sorry. Rather a difficult first day back. 13-year-old over in Illescote, pregnant till the father beat it out of her. Oh, God, grim. Sorry, Faraday. One feels so useless. Rather wonder why I bothered coming back. Oh, don't say that. I missed you. And... Caroline called a couple of days ago. Mrs. Ayres had some kind of... well... turn. They weren't awfully forthcoming about it. I couldn't find much wrong with her. You went to Hundreds? I did. I tell you, I couldn't leave fast enough. I feel for Caroline, stuck out there. She's the best of the bunch by a mile. - Doctor, I want... - Miss Ayres. Can we please start again? So tell me what happened. Don't really know. I feel silly now. We don't come in here often. You know, not anymore. But we were checking for leaks and we heard a... It sounds stupid, but we heard a sort of knocking sound. Down there. We found these marks. You know, I thought it must've been that little girl at first. But Betty cleaned up, you know, after... She would have noticed. They won't come off. Well, that's not all. Mother was woken by something in the night. She thought a bird had got in. She called Betty, and they searched her dressing room for it. Well, I love this one. That was my favorite when I was your age. Go on, try it. Okay. Oh, Dr. Faraday. Look at us. Wait. Now. Betty. - Come on. - Oh, madam, shall I? The doctor disapproves of our frivolity. I'm happy to see you looking so well. Caroline told me you'd been unsettled. Ah, you mean after my discovery. Might I see? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Suki. After all this time, I didn't suppose there was much trace of her left. Your mother's heart rate's a little elevated. It's hardly surprising. Otherwise, - she's in perfect health. - Oh, for God's sake, Faraday. Right. Shall I explain what happened? Look... the marks downstairs you found by accident, yes? But they triggered a buried memory for your mother, so she remembered the others. And the new marks today? They're not new. Those marks, whilst disturbing... Even I felt that... They're nothing more than they appear. And what about the knocking sound? It's the heating pipes, I imagine. No, we haven't had the heating on - for months. - Then the pipes contracting in the cold. Caroline, you mustn't let this business get inside you. It can all be explained. Faraday... I'm so glad you're here. When I'm alone, I can't tell anymore. Whenever you go away, something horrible happens. Dear girl. There's some talk of my going back permanently. To live in London? I should have to think about what I was leaving behind. Not much. Lidcote would seem like a bad dream in no time. I meant in terms of you and me. Well, look, Faraday, that time in the car, I... I behaved like a fool. - I was the fool. - No. Caroline, I've-I've missed you. I've missed you like hell. God. What a bloody idiot you've made of me. I shouldn't have left you. I won't do it again. Look... you perfect child. Be no more of this sort of thing, you know, once we're married. - You're not a skivvy. - Faraday, what...? Just say yes, Caroline. Just say yes. Hmm? What this house needs is a big dose of happiness. Oh. It's done. Hmm. We haven't announced it formally yet because Caroline's shy. And there's the question of Mrs. Ayres. Have you told her? We didn't want to worry her before we'd clarified our plans. Do you think she'll approve? I think she'll be delighted. Well, it's terrific news. Congratulations. What are you up to? Writing to Roderick. Have you told him about us? Betty could come in any moment. She'll have to get used to catching us kissing. She'll be bringing us eggs and bacon in bed in the mornings. But if we were married, we wouldn't be here. You wouldn't rather live above the surgery? We can hardly abandon your mother. You can't think she'll accept us living with her? - In any case, what about London? - London? I turned down the position to stay here with you. You never said you did that. I thought it was obvious. Look, don't worry about your mother. She'll come around. - She won't. - She will. She'll have to. Betty, what are you doing here? Well, you rang for me, miss. I did not. It must have been Mother. Well, Mrs. Ayres is upstairs. It was this bell that rung. Rang itself, did it? Well, I don't know, but... Go and see what she wants. Oh, and by the way, all the water's gone brown. Babb must have hit a pipe. You have it your way... for now. I'll go and check on Babb. Told you. Dining room. See? Mother might have woken up. Go and see if she needs anything, hmm? Betty? That was Mother's bedroom. Oh, damn it, come on. Mice. What's all this noise? Mice. There's some poison at the farm. I'll run and get some. Nursery. It's just them mice, madam. Come. Come. Come listen. What do you hear? I don't know. We must check upstairs. Well, let's wait for Miss Caroline. Madam, wait. Please, let's wait for Miss Caroline. You stay if you like. What have I to fear in a nursery? Susan? Susan? Betty? Betty?! Betty! Betty, unlock the door. Betty, unlock... the door! Betty. Caroline! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Rod was right. There's something in this house that hates us. That's nonsense, Caroline. No, we're so changed... from even a year ago. I knew this house had summat bad. We told you. When did you tell him? First time I felt it. Mrs. Ayres believes me. - You told Mrs. Ayres? - She said it was a ghost and not to worry. It wouldn't do no harm. No harm? Does this look like no harm to you, Betty? No one's blaming you, Betty. You've been very brave. We failed her. - Shh. - My beautiful girl. I wanted her so desperately. But when she came... I was afraid. Mrs. Ayres, your mind is playing tricks. You need to rest. - I'm not an invalid. - I'm the doctor here. You must allow me to decide who the invalids are. And you must remember whose house this is. Stop. Stop, please. I'm so sorry, Mama. What have you to be sorry for? Difficult job? Seeley. Routine tonsillectomy. I made a pig's ear of it. Yes, well, it's too many night calls. I know the feeling. Are you finished for the day? I just feel things are out of control. This business seems almost contagious. I was medical officer at a girls' school for a while. One time there was this fashion for fainting. Girls going down like ninepins. Eventually their mistresses, too. That's just it. I don't know where it will end. Caroline has begun to believe there's something supernatural involved. - -Some malevolent force in the house. And it's madness, I know, but... I'm beginning to wonder myself. What exactly are you saying? We all subscribe to the general principle of a conscious personality with a sort of dream self attached. You're suggesting this subconscious self could somehow...? Detach under sufficient pressure. Become mischievous or malign. Acting out all the nasty impulses the conscious mind wants hidden? Isn't that the old theory of the poltergeist? Oh, God. Then there isn't an ounce of science in it. Oh, no, no. Not so fast. - You might be on to something. - Hmm? What if science has yet to find a way to measure such things? Look at my fainting females. It is generally women at the root of this stuff, of course. Don't they have some young housemaid stuck out at Hundreds, no one to flirt with? Betty's a child still. Mmm, and children are capable of the most intense desire. Thank you for walking me. I'm very much enjoying it. You know I'm never left alone. I suppose that's on your orders. Hmm. No matter. I have something I want to say before Caroline gets back. You must take her away from here. - I shall do no such thing. - Yes. Leave Susan and me alone together. Susan is a memory. We've agreed that, haven't we? How innocent you are. She's with me all the time. She's here with me now. Please stop this. She belongs here. You do not. Mrs. Ayres... What is it? How did you do this? My little girl is upset. Could you take this off, please? Sit down. The cords were cut. Don't you remember? When Susan was playing such tricks on us. What did you...? Let me see. Stop. Stop that. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop. Betty! Stop! Stop! I'm going to check on her. Let her sleep. She's still under the Veronal. I'd like to bring in a psychiatrist. First Roddie, now her. How long before it's my turn? That's absurd. My mother would rather die than bring any more shame upon this family. I won't abandon her to her delusions for the sake of class pride. No, Faraday. Do you understand? I forbid it. Faraday! Did you lock her in? What? Mother. Mother, open the door. Mrs. Ayres. What have you done, Mama? What have you done? What have you done? ♪ ♪ Like as a father pitieth his own children, even so is the Lord merciful unto them that fear Him. For He knoweth whereof we are made. He remembereth that we are but dust. We mean to ask Caroline to come and stay with us. Well, she can't be allowed to remain all alone in that unhappy house. She isn't all alone. She has me. You've been very brave today, Rod. Get Caroline out. She'll be next. It's all right. No, no, no, I, I've lots to sort out, but I'll be absolutely fine. We had such fun here in the old days. I used to visit quite often, but unfortunately my health hasn't allowed that lately. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm afraid I can't remember your name, Doctor. - Faraday. - Ah. No. I don't believe my sister ever mentioned you. Uh... I've been watching you. That can't have been terribly interesting. It must be late. You should go. Not until you eat something. Oh, I couldn't. You must. I will eat. I promise. But later. Thank you for today. Caroline. Tell me just one thing. When may we be married? Please, I'm so tired. I want to be here. With you. I've been patient, haven't I? But so soon after Mother's death, I... She'd want to know you were being looked after. A month is long enough to sort everything out. - But we have so much to discuss. -I know. You'll need bridesmaids, something to wear. No, I don't want a fuss. I have plenty of dresses. Six weeks. From today. Yes. Yes, all right. Yes? Can you please just let me sleep? The last time I sat down to eat at this table, Betty, I was eight years old. My mother was with me, standing just over there. That's a funny thought. I never guessed I'd be back here, like this. Wish she'd lived to see it. My father, too. My father wants me to go back home. He's on at me something terrible. You and I are all Miss Caroline has left. I need you to help look after her. Well, he thinks there's a curse on the house after... Madam. I think we all feel a little bit that way. Miss Caroline says that I should sleep upstairs now. I think she's frightened by herself. What if I told you that she wouldn't be by herself much longer? That Miss Caroline was soon to be married? Married? Mm. Oh, Doctor, when? Very soon. And I'm going to need your help. ♪ ♪ I, uh, brought something for you to copy. You say the lady's indisposed. Will she be able to walk? Yes. It's nothing serious. Ah. Caroline. Cooped up inside on this lovely day? You'll be absolutely kippered. This is flying in the face of convention, I know, but, uh... I had it made to match one of your others. Betty helped. We've been quite the secret agents. There'll be something for your head and hands, too, of course. And, lastly... This was my mother's. Sorry, I can't do this. Forgive me. I've sprung it on you. We'll look at these later or in private - if you prefer... -No, I mean I can't do any of it. I can't marry you. Caroline... I'm sorry. I like you very much, and I'm so grateful, but I-I... Darling, you're confused. No, I'm seeing very clearly. Please, you... you're tired. Stop saying that. Sometimes I think you want me to be tired. You know I want you to be happy. And I can't be happy if I marry you. We don't have to be husband and wife right away, if that's the problem. God, can't you see? This whole thing between us has never been real. I'm going away. I've put the estate up for sale. You can't. It's not yours to sell. Hepton's already drawn up the papers. I've had power of attorney since Rod was first ill. When he gets better, he can join me. Join you where? I'll go up to London as soon as I can. Then... Canada or America. Canada. But I will go. Before it's too late. Anne, I'm sorry, do you think David could take my evening surgery? No, it's rather a violent stomach thing, I'm afraid. I... I really would be most grateful. Thank you. ♪ ♪ The next few days were a sort of blur, a bad dream from which I was slow to wake. Hundreds Hall was lost to me. As was Caroline. There was, no doubt, fun at my expense in Lidcote. That would teach me to look outside my class. I did, for a time, consider leaving, but... a man cannot outrun himself. Doctor! Dr. Faraday! The call came sometime around 3:00. It was Betty. In a dreadful state. Wanting you, I suppose, but the exchange passed her to me. House call in Edgworth. It would have been instant. There's nothing you could have done. The court calls Miss Elizabeth Walker. We went to bed early that night, Miss Ayres and me. We'd been cleaning all day; we were tired. And did Miss Ayres seem to you to be in low spirits? Not at all. She was happy, - looking forward to leaving. - So you went to your room and you heard nothing more until...? About half past 2:00. Creak on the stairs. At first I was frightened. Frightened because...? Big house, sir, and-and sometimes... well, it's lonely and dark. Then I realized the steps were Miss Ayres. Her room was just opposite, so I wasn't worried then. - Except... - Except...? ♪ ♪ Except they were going up to the second floor. There's no reason to go up there. It's empty, it's locked up. ♪ ♪ - - And-and then I heard her stop. Make a sound. You. You. Caroline. There's been an accident. Miss Caroline. Dr. Faraday? Dr. Faraday? Would you support a verdict of suicide whilst of unsound mind? I believe, based on my dealings with Miss Ayres in the last weeks of her life, that her mind had become clouded. Her death may indeed have been a suicide. Thank you, Dr. Faraday. ♪ ♪ The first time I saw Hundreds Hall was July 1919. I'd passed by its gates often enough but never imagined they would open to me, a common village boy. Oh, the whole world of Hundreds impressed me terribly. My mother had described it often, but nothing could have prepared me for the spell it cast that day. ♪ ♪
