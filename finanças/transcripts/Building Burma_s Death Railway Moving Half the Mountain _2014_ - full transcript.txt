70 years ago in the jungles of Thailand and Burma, a railway was constructed at the cost of thousands of human lives. People used to say to me, they used to say, oh you know, fancy you buying a Japanese car or buying a Japanese television or something like that and I always thought that was a load of nonsense because that didn't make any difference. I had worst nightmare 10 days ago. And that's 70 odd years after. The year is 1941 and Japanese forces sweep through southeast Asia crushing all resistance. Their ultimate goal, to take the jewel in the crown of the British Empire. India. The Imperial Army's biggest problem is moving supplies through the treacherous terrain of Thailand and Burma. A train track will be their answer to be built by prisoners of war. It'll become known as the death railway. My original group was 1,700 strong. By the time that the railway was finished, there were only 400 left. The second World War has been raging across Europe for several years now and is not going the Allies way. Setback follows setback. In the Far East, Germany's ally Japan attacks US forces at Pearl Harbor, invades territories across the Pacific and is now advancing towards Malaya and the impregnable British fortress of Singapore. Thousands of British and Australian troops are sent to defend the colony. For many, this will be the defining moment of their lives. People ask me, how is it that you reached the age of 100? I said so many times I have just missed death. This has happened to me so often. I said it's so much of my life has been luck. I don't feel old, I don't want to feel old but I think of the portraits when I suddenly have a 93rd birthday, this is crazy. It's just that life, it's full and rich and interesting and I love it. I have never spoken about it. A part, a bit was my family, but never really. There's a certain point where you don't want to talk about it. The Japanese, I supposed, had to be about 100-K up. The Malaya beach were from Singapore when we got there. So they're dropping bombs on the gulf and kill a lot of people in the ship when they came in and the docks were full of people trying to get away. It was definitely tragic. We were the last ship in the convoy. It was about 11 o'clock in the morning when we were going in there a flight of bombers come over. Peeled off one at a time, come in, bomb us. We had got it several times. It started to burn and there was thick columns of black smoke coming along the deck and I said to my mate by radio I'm going over the side. So I leave him, now we're crouched down by the cabins and I get up on the rail, stand up on the rail and I said, "Come on, Pat, I'm going." That's the last I seen of him. In the same dark, steaming tropical jungle men of both the British and Imperial forces go through an intensive up to training course to fulfill the need for officers of the Malayan defense force. Using collapsible boats, they protect themselves in the methods of jungle warfare. It was terribly bushy stuff, really. Tremendously bushy and for time when you should have been training we didn't, and so we went really into war not well trained at all, I mean hardly trained, it was crazy. The jungle holds many a secrets to counter any move directed against Singapore or Australia. Absolutely no preparation whatsoever had been done even to clear a field so you could see what you were doing 'cause we just faced mangroves forms. The Japanese, they have tanks, they have armored cars, but they also had bicycles and those bicycles won their war. They came down Malaya like a wild. 36,000 Japanese soldiers close in on Singapore. Facing them are almost 85,000 Allied troops. But the Japanese are motivated, experienced, and expert at jungle warfare. The Allies find themselves constantly outflanked and outfought. So we had this brief set of fighting and it's just a matter of very close contact fighting which is horrific. We were actually under mortar fire and my colonel literally lost his head. There's no question I was always scared stiff when I heard shells landing near one. Despite some fierce and stubborn fighting, the Japanese advance continues to close in on Singapore. Winston Churchill warns his generals that surrender is out of the question. We are dreading rumors that the Japanese didn't take prisoners and also we didn't know what was gonna happen but it was a terrible, terrible reflection of the powers that be of ours that were running that show out there. It should never have happened. February the 15th, 1942, the unthinkable does happen and the British Commander General Percival surrenders Singapore to the Japanese. The white flag went up at about four o'clock on the Sunday. Churchill would later describe this as the worst moment of the war. The extraordinary thing is that the Japs of course were completely amazed at having captured so many prisoners. In all, 130,000 men are captured during this short campaign. To add to the humiliation of defeat, they're forced to watch the victorious Japanese generals drive by. The Allied prisoners are marched up to the northern tip of Singapore, to the military base Changi. We learned that everyone was going out to this Changi area and they marched us 18 miles. People say what's it like being taken prisoner of war? Chaos for Singapore and everywhere and no law and everything. When things began to break down, which they did very quickly, malaria started. And then people got dysentery. The Japs as part of this stay literally brought out loads of barbed wire which they then told us to put up around a certain perimeter and that was the first time we were actually, you could say we were in a prison camp. You learn Japanese or pseudo Japanese and I can still swear in Japanese but I've forgotten all my Japanese. They would put your shoes and say meaning what is the name of it until you would say shit and so they would go around pointing at other people's good boots, pointing and say, "You got you number one shit." That means you have a very good pair of boots and it was hilarious because we had a lot of fun for about two weeks and then they suddenly got the message through the interpreter and then we had to learn Japanese orders. The Imperial Army has a very tight grip on Japanese society. They've been fighting a war in the Far East since the mid 1930's and are the driving force behind Japan's territorial ambitions. All young men are conscripted at 21 into a tough and brutal training program. By June 1942, the Japanese advance has continued across the Pacific and up into Burma towards India. With an urgent need to move supplies the solution is to dust off an old British plan, to build a railway. The railway itself was only about 415 kilometers long, that's not an enormous distance at all to link it up with Rangoon. So they could bring people to Saigon, across to Bangkok and then take them on the railway right up to the Burmese front so really the railroad was not a long railway in that term but it was the most hellish conditions to make it. The Japanese realize they have vast pool of potential labor in the prisoners at Changi. Things always change in these camps and about seven months later I was called to the orderly office and told I was put on a draft to go to a holiday camp. There was about 600 of us that were selected and we were taken down to Singapore and loaded on the trucks. And then we had a train journey to Thailand from Singapore. There were 32 in my own particular truck and that meant that only a certain small percentage could actually sit down at any one time. The kit was stuck in the center. There was no sanitary conditions at all, like absolutely appalling. This is where the real degradation starts and that journey lasted five days. We went up to the first place we stopped in Thailand was a place called Ban Pong. That was an ex Japanese camp there, the Japs had been stationed in there but the camp was under about a foot of water. I had a large box of watercolors and I had to shove the box away because there were two of us but I kept about six, eight or ten palates and of all things I did paint lasted me for as long as I wanted them. And we were taken up the river. We were going to start up the transit camps and they dropped us off then at 20 mile intervals to go into the jungle and start clearing the jungle because there would be the main body of men coming from Singapore and they would be matching up the jungle track that followed the River Khwae. And then we were told all men march 150 kilometers. The question of escaping was something that on occasion you thought about but very quickly dismissed because you had at least 1,200 miles of sea with lots of island in between in the middle of it, 1,200 miles before you would get to safety or 1,200 miles up country onto the rail we found. If you fell by the wayside, couldn't go any farther and nobody could help you you were left to die or they made sure you died. And that's called the death march. The POW's, already now weak and ill, are going to build the track for the Japanese through the mountainous jungle terrain. Then we had to climb up the topography and it's during a monsoon, of course, and you would take two steps and went back two. And the thick jungle there and we started clearing jungle where the railway was going to go through so that was the first introduction to the actual job. It got worse from then on. They had so much cheap labor like apart from us, they had the native populations of these places that they took over like they had brought up something right about a couple of hundred thousand natives from down in Malaya and that like with promises of a great life but lots of them died in the jungle there. I forget how long, but two or three months was monsoon. For the first quite a few weeks at this camp that had no roofs, we just ate, worked, slept under the rain. It was really a problem of supply. The only communication was the river and being the time of the monsoon the rivers tended to flood and this rendered it almost impossible for supplies to get up. All we got was supposed to be 250 grams of rice. That usually came in the form of rice full of weevils and such. So we ate any vegetation that we could. Snakes were very good to eat if you'd get them. The first one I killed was by accident and I just banged. It takes a lot to kill a snake because they'll thrash a tremendous amount of time and I said we've got to have something to eat. He said, do you know what you just killed? And I said no. He said that's a king cobra and I hadn't known but it didn't matter really. The lizards were quite nice, they were quite big, they could be up to about 18 inches long, quite big like you know, and you'd just kill them, skin them and cook them. Either grill them or put them in some water and cook them in a pot. The men are now starving but still the Japanese refuse to sign the Geneva Convention, which protects the rights of prisoners of war. If our men misbehave, if the Japanese said that, misbehavior is nearly over stealing food then we were all as officers lined up and had what's called bin-tos, that's a Japanese officer come up and give you a really hard bang on your face in front of all the men to try and teach them that they shouldn't steal. POW camp guard was trained in Japanese military camp full time for around five months and they are hitting almost every day accoriding to the Japanese training style. There was nothing wrong with the ordinary Japanese people, no it was the Japanese Army was the problem, especially their Army, they were taught to be brutal, that was part of their life and it was something that you have a job to do to understand but right from the top of their headquarters right the way down through their Army they were totally, they were even brutal to one another. They have to encourage POW's to work hard to perform their work. But most of the hitting wad one by the Korean guards in the POW camp. The Koreans themselves say that Japanese soldiers and military pigeon then comes at the bottom Korean guards they say. If somebody tried to escape and they were caught, they weren't pleased with just shooting them. No, no, they had to torture. If you weren't working hard enough one of the things they would make you do was to stand with this, hold a stone above your head, well when you're weak anyway if you put both arms up you start to feel faint very quickly and so you would drop the stone so it would land, you would drop the stone fairly quickly and pick it up which was better than collapsing because once you collapse on the ground, they knocked you around and kicked you all over the place so you probably would get more damaged through fainting so you had to play the game, really. I was going back to the latrine one night and one of these Korean guards started to be homosexual with me and I without thinking I just kicked him in the spot where no man wants to be kicked and he fell so the guards screamed. I got beaten up for a night and a day and the following night until I no longer remember much other than the pain and then I was put in the black hole. That really was probably the one time when I felt this was the end. A sweatbox as they used to put them in, put people in, they're made of bamboo, stand about that high off the ground and they were made of small thin bamboos constructed, they were made so they weren't long enough for a man to stretch right out in and they were so low that you couldn't sit up properly so if you were cooped up in there and you could get perhaps you'd be sentenced to perhaps for certain things, you'd get a four night punishment in there. In mid-1943, the Japanese are still fighting in the north of Burma but short of supplies and troops the war is no longer going their way. We saw Japanese going up to the Burma front. We watched the Japanese troops and they were unbelievable in what they put up with. There were times when the treatment and even the food they got perhaps it was generally better than ours, but not much. It was such an urgent project to get a line through so they could feed their northern front with troops. This is what the railroad was about. So there was just urgency about the whole thing, it was called a spee-to movement and got worse and worse and worse and you had to work harder and harder and so on. As anxiety to get the railway finished grows within the Japanese ranks, the death rate amongst POW's and native workers increases dramatically. If my sick parade got too large a Japanese private, was able to, everyone had to work for the Japanese. A Japanese private would come along, a non-medical private, take my sick parade and as long as a man, men were fit enough to stand then they were fit enough to work and off we would go. Actually, there was orders to finish the railway in a hurry so they had to compel the sick man to work hard. One of the most difficult sections of the construction is an area called Hin-tock, better known as Hellfire Pass. When they were making big cuttings which were done largely with hammer and tap, you would use a certain number of charges to blow the rock and one of the games or the occasions, they would fire a charge without telling anybody. So some people got very badly injured with flying sharp rock. I mean why, what's the sense of all this here? We went out in the morning with all the tools that had been issued and after work when we returned there had to be a role call of everybody, all the tools had to be handed in and if one were short, there were usually a few short, we had to parade instantly with practically every day the odd one or two dead who died out there, they had to be put down at the end, at the side, in order to prove the same number had returned as went out in the morning. Every morning I psyched myself up to survive that day. That day only because every day was never as good as the last one, it was never good. There was never any hope. Never any hope. Because of lack of control, most of the people died was because of the sickness, not by the, being hitted, cruel hits or death or, isn't so. But if the people had good control of themselves, they didn't drink water from the river or eat raw fish from, if the people, POW behaves, very well they didn't catch sickness. And you catch I think every disease imaginable was there but the worst one with the most lives lost was cholera and the Japanese themselves were scared and we had to bury these bodies. That was I think perhaps the low point of my experience up there. I mean looking back now I can hardly believe I experienced all this. The medical officers in my opinion were absolute angels. They had no drugs to work with, not even an aspirin but a hospital camp in Turk-eye called Wavy-dun-lob and did fantastic work. Wavy-dun-lob, the most wonderful Australian surgeon, be a man I can't praise enough. I had something on my forehead, he was gonna take it off, there wasn't any anesthesia for it but I think it was melanoma or something he was worried about and they set us with another table and there was an Australian, really almost a skeleton kneeling down with his bum in the air because he talked about wanting to use a prox-o-scope which was made in the camps and I remember him looking into this bottom, you see, and he said in this lovely Australian voice and he said, "Oh yes," he said, "I think I've seen you before." And we fell off the table, we were rolling about what a lovely way to greet your friend. At one camp alone, over 120 legs are to be amputated. Operations, mostly amputations, as a result of these jungle ulcers were done with a sword borrowed from the Japanese which they said they wanted back clean after the operation or operations. They did occasionally produce a bit of sake so people could be put out to some extent. I said to him I've got this ulcer, what could I do? He said, well I'm sorry, I have nothing to give you and I don't have any drugs but if you go down to the latrine, pick up maggots, count them, put them on top of your ulcer and let the maggots do their work. I said, what will they do? They'll eat all the rotten flesh. And he says with a good chance you'll get a clean wound. I've been bad, they kicked my nose in, I had a bad fractured nose and a hole between my eyes, I couldn't see anything, I was next to an Aussie who had his leg cut off and after that morning, a big Aussie, I mean, routine stuff under the most crude circumstances then we were lying on bamboo. Anyway, in the middle of the hot, another man who was in, and he had an ulcer that was granulating quite well, it was in far better condition than hundreds of the others around him and he was kneeling up and hugging his knees and rocking like somebody. The patient did it out of sheer agony and pain and he kept on saying I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die and this Aussie said look mate, he said if you're gonna die hurry up and bloody do it, I want some sleep in this lovely, friendly voice and we were falling about. Within two hours he was dead and I remember telling Aussie in the morning, and I said don't cry and he said the last thing anybody ever said to him. The railway is finally completed in October 1943, on schedule, but at the cost of over 120,000 lives. The POW's and local workers that died building the railway are buried where they fall. One life lost for every sleeper laid. The jungle was full of British dead. We buried a lot of them where they fell. We left 12,000 dead up there, quite a path from the wreckage that survived. But it's all been for no purpose. Within months the war had turned against the Japanese and the Allies start to regain territories. These converted Hel-i-cans now called hurry-bombers carried two 500 pound bombs tucked beneath the wing. Down there somewhere in that tangled wilderness lies their target or rather that's where their target lay after this heavy pounding, there'll not be much hospitality left for the Japanese invader. I think some of the officers, I think we had some information from somewhere that things were getting pretty sticky. We had this huge camp with a huge pitch around it and a big banner on one side and they put a machine gun into the wall and which really told us quite a lot about what they were intending to do anyway but still, we didn't know. And the of course within about nine or 10 days, they had Hiroshima and Nagasaki and that finished it, we were just saved by the bell, really. The Japanese were, had ceased to fight from that time on. Well we knew then we were officially free. Japan surrenders to the Allied forces on September the 2nd, 1945. The POW's are at last free men again. The Allies had retaken Singapore and a couple days after that they were beginning to march the Japanese, by then prisoners. And one of our divisional people, soldiers like people do, soldier's just watching what was going on and at one point he turned to his pal and said look at those poor buggers and I said to him, and that to me sums up the attitude of the ordinary soldier. We had a Sergeant Major, a British Sergeant Major that was in our camp but we didn't have any officers with us and what he said was he gave us a bit of good advice, he said, he advised us not to take any action against the Japanese. He said you've survived three and a half years of being prisoners, so he said think of your families, don't do anything stupid that might get you killed. Japanese guards were made to carry the sick and wounded to they key site where landing craft will take them to the hospital ship in the bay. Other prisoners who are able to walk make their way to the landing craft which will carry them on the first stage of a happy journey. From the far eastern shores, many have already started a longer voyage, taking them back to the land they have served so bravely. We, there was no one there to meet us. There was no bands there to meet us or anything like that. But we were just taken off the boat and taken to a transit camp there in Southampton and we were there for a couple of days and then we were just stuck on the train and sent home. I used to go out in the morning and I'd walk the streets of Aberdeen for hours and hours and looking, looking for somebody. Was that you? I was forgetting I'd been away six and a half years. When I got back, I decided I'd forget everything, I'm going to start a new life and I didn't join any ex prisoner of war outfit or any prison or anything, I didn't want to have anything as far as I'm concerned although I'm talking about it now, I just wouldn't talk about any of my ex prisoners of war experiences or anything. No, I'm going to start a new life and something quite new. And I would have nothing to do with what's happened to me that's just happened, it's finished. It was a bit overwhelming with having so many people coming to you and wanting to know everything about you and all that like, you know? We had no understanding of what horrors we had lived through and how the comparison between people's kindness and the brutality that we had been experiencing. It's been very difficult with the family because I never spoke about it. My wife died without knowing. Mind you, she must've seen or felt the swinging of moods. She wasn't dumb. And one night when I had the nightmare, I finished up with my hands on her throat. So at that stage I went into the spare bedroom there was a chair, I'm used to sleeping up. For weeks. I couldn't sleep properly for about 10 years, that's a long time but I could only just sleep on the sofas. In the camp you just slept under the surface, you were ready to move on but then I come in and start beating people up and turn everybody out for working party, didn't know what was gonna happen by day or night very often and so you would sleep by there and I knew exactly where everything of mine was, that I could put my hands on it. I think she might've drawn a few drawing things and so you were always ready to move. When I came home, it was nice to just fold my clothes up and I set them the way I do now and I know just where they are. Well, compensation and I think I'm right in saying that I got 30 pounds, we all did, several years after the war. We were certainly the worst country of the lot at doing anything at all to get compensation from the Japs. I blame it mostly on politicians and above all the treasury because we finally got, I think the figure was 10,000 pounds, about I'm guessing 15 years ago, not much more, and there weren't many left so the treasury obviously saved a lot of money. When they talked of trying to get some financial benefit out of it that might have done a bit of good to help to heal some of the things for the blokes but for me I have no ill feeling against the Japanese at all. I meet Japanese here now, no trouble. I mean the Japanese for all what they did they have repented and let the generation know what happened. But in Japan they don't. Japanese say, the Emperor say they express deep remorse for the POW. I think that was enough for Japanese thought that was enough for apology but POW's didn't think so. Let the Emperor come and apologize to me. That might be the answer. And I will decide whether he was sincere or not. Actually there are two reasons why I don't hate the Japanese. The one reason is it would do them no harm but if I hate anyone it does me harm. And I say that the other reason, I'm a Christian and Christians are taught to love and not to hate. I can't stand the way we all, I suppose, I do it sometimes, we generalize people, nations or groups or bankers or industrialist or whatever because there are some good, bad and indifferent anywhere. In all I think I've just been terribly lucky. I'm very happy doing what I'm doing and I have no regrets, really, it doesn't matter. I have been there and I've done it. All the things that I ever wanted to do. And I have no regrets. The fact that I was a prisoner of war was just a blip in my life, you know. I'm determined to live and beat the Japanese because I'll outlive them all I hope. All those who were involved. One of the most interesting parts is this, was the sheer ingenuity, you put a lot of people together, they're tennsmith, they're pharmacists, chemists, so you put all these people together and you can begin to start moving half the mountain and I think that really saw the corporate magic of the whole thing. It was so important. Thank you today.
