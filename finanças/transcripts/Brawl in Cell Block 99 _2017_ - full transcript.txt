Serious? No. Why? Well, I don't know exactly. Um... I was sad. And we haven't been close since... You know. I know. I thought maybe you were doing the same thing. You were staying out late every night, coming to bed after I was asleep. No. I was working or working out. And staying clear. I didn't know. Communication between us... there hasn't been much. Did you fall off the wagon? Almost. Did you? No. Do you want to end it with us? I don't know. I want things to be different than they've been. Our marriage, us, we've, uh... It's like when I go into the minimart at the gas station and get coffee. They got those three metal containers there. One's got cream, one's got milk, and the other's got that gray-lookin' skim stuff. Every time I go in there, those labels are faced away, and I have to guess which one's the real stuff, the cream. But every time, the first container I grab is always that milk or that skim stuff. It's never the one I want. The law of averages says one out of three times, I... I ought to get the cream, but it doesn't happen. Maybe if I go in there a thousand times, it'll even out like it should. I'll have a run of pickin' out the cream fifty or a hundred times in a row, but, uh... I don't think so. I don't think things even out fair like that. Look at us. I think we should start again. Try to have another baby. We don't pick up where things went bad for us... the miscarriage... we're through. I've thought about that, too, but... I only get called in to substitute once or twice a week. You just lost your job. I'm gonna call Gil. You're gonna be a drug dealer? No. I'm gonna drive packages for a friend. You said you would never work for Gil. So we're both breaking promises today. [ Scoffs ] I want us in a better home than this shithole. With kids and happy. I'm tired of getting the goddamn skim milk and hoping that luck brings us the cream, 'cause it won't, not ever. This won't be forever. I promise. Will you abide? Yeah.

He's my top runner. Howdy. Nice to meet you. This is Pedro, one of the men who will accompany you during the pickup. And this is Roman, the other. I'm not doing a pickup with him. And for what reason? He looks like he's using. Roman's been clean for two years. I test my employees. He's extremely reliable, and he knows what to do in adverse situations. Sorry. But words from a stranger don't trump instinct. Bradley. Give us a moment. Let me talk to you. I need you to go along, protect my interests. Our interests. Eleazar swears by the guy. And it ain't like you haven't had your problems before. That's 14 years done. The bottle ain't the same thing as junk. Don't kid yourself with that bullshit. You look at my brother and your old man. Boozin's a bad decision that leads to 10,000 more and then the last one. The guy is juiced. - Maybe not junk, but... - Bradley. Don't make me give you an ultimatum. Sounds like you just gave me one. I can't give this to Oscar or Tony or Randolph. Elbow to elbow with guys like those. Shipment this big, I need you. You help me set up this partnership, I'll give you two months off when your little baby's born. - Three. - Done. We're good. I'll go. But if something comes up, I got the reins. They shall mind you.

I'm not gonna tell you anything you want to hear. And prison will give me plenty of time to look at guys I don't like. What is it that you think I want to hear? Hmm? The names of your associates? The people who profited from all your hard work while they wiped their dirty asses with that? You can pretend you don't care, but I saw that video. I saw how you took down those lowlifes when they went up against the police, even though you could've got away clean. I knew before you told me that you got an American flag in your home. You probably got more than one. I got two. Because of your selfless actions, no police were killed in that event, which tells me that you know the difference between right and wrong and that you have a moral compass. So help us. Give us some names. Give me one important name. Who are you working for? I work alone. Who supplies your crystal? Some guy. - "Some guy" got a name? - I forgot. Would you remember if I showed you a list of names? Don't like to read. Won't even see a movie if it's got subtitles. Well, what would happen if I read them aloud? You wouldn't even have to say anything. Just nod your head up and down. I'll narrow it down for you. What's your name? Detective Lawrence Watkins. - That wasn't it. - You find this humorous? Your tricks are. Every once in a while, I see a man in that chair who could just as easily be on this side of the table, a man of principle, who had a run of bad luck and just went the wrong way. I'm not gonna talk. I know that this is your first offense, but you're looking at four years, maybe five. Do you know that drug traffickers actually serve those sentences? I'm aware that the system is harder on guys that distribute drugs than it is on men who commit acts of violence against women and children. Do you think that's fair? You ever see a man with meth mouth? Hmm? You ever see the 14-year-old girl who's addicted... I'm not gonna argue with you, Larry. I'm not gonna give you any info. I know what I did, and I know what the sentence is gonna be. It's done. - You have other options. - I don't. Your wife told me that you were gonna have a baby girl. You'll be in prison when she says her first word, and I guarantee you that word will not be "Daddy." MAN: Okay, go inside. [ Door opens ] Want to keep it in good taste. Yeah, it tasted pretty good. Sit. I gave them your change of clothes. Thanks. I got some stuff I want to say. Okay. I don't want you at the hearing. I know how it's gonna go, and there's no point for you turning up to watch it happen. I'm not contending the charges. I want to be there. I want to be supportive. Well, that won't be any good for anybody. Actually make things harder. There's no reason for you and the koala to, uh, go through that experience, for me to watch you go through it, so... Please. Okay. It's gonna be four years, maybe five, and I have to serve most of it, if not every damn day. [ Voice breaking ] Sorry. I will visit as much as I'm allowed, and I'll bring our girl. No. I don't want the first time for her to see me to be in prison. We'll come up with something to tell her when she is old enough to know something's wrong, and I'll give her the full truth when she's old enough to understand. Okay. I'll wait for you. No matter how long it is. I will never, never make that mistake again. I promise you. I know. So that's it, then. I love you. [ Exhales sharply ] I considered the defendant's plea of nolo contendre and also the very serious nature of his crimes. I hereby sentence Bradley Darrel Thomas to be incarcerated for seven years at the Franklin R. James Medium Security Detention Center. This hearing has come to its lawful conclusion. [ Gate buzzes ] Even on the outside, that's some dismal shit. You seen those pictures of that prison in Austria? Man, I wish we were going there. You should aim higher with your wishes. OFFICER: Gentlemen, listen up. Follow the red line to the door. Stop there. Tell your name to the man with the clipboard. Bradley Thomas. Proceed. ENRIQUE: Enrique Gomez. OFFICER: Welcome to the Fridge. RUSSELL: Russell Harris. [ Man coughs ] IRVING: Next. Return yourself to the end of the line. ENRIQUE: I was next. I just had to run to... IRVING: Maintain your place in line, or you relinquish it. Take yourself back to the end of the line. ENRIQUE: That's not fair. I had to run to the bathroom. IRVING: You're delaying the entire process for everybody. Remove yourself. - Worse than the DMV. - Next. Next. Bradley Thomas. Do you have a receipt for the ring? Receipt? No. - Put it in there. - Why? Inmates are not allowed to possess any jewelry which is a value of more than $75. Well, it's made out of stainless steel. It ain't... I'm neither a metallurgist nor a jeweler. I cannot attest to its value. Relinquish it now. Sorry. I didn't mean to... Reclaim your possessions and take your place at the end of the line. Next. [ Door buzzes ] Next. Bradley Thomas. I recall. [ Ring clinks ] Well. That's better. Best to remain civilized, Mr. Thomas. Even in a prison. Enjoy your stay. [ Door buzzes ] [ Gate opens ] - Bradley Thomas? - Yes. Stand inside the box. Remove your clothing. Leave your underwear on until I tell you to lower them. You can put your clothing in that box. I figured. Looks like we're locking up another genius. Oh. Should we let him go so he can cure cancer? Help the scientists unify string theories? Legs apart. Hands on top of your head. Open your mouth. Lift up your tongue. You can shut it. Now for everybody's favorite part. Lower your drawers. Put your hands on top of your head. He's an A-minus. Are you, uh, Bradley Thomas? - I am. - I'm Lefty. I'm in charge of your orientation. You got bunions? My right foot's injured, and these shoes are about two sizes too small. We'll tell Denise. She's your case worker. Can you walk for now? As far as prisons go, you could do worse than the Fridge. Though this place sure isn't like that one in Austria. You get a private cell. It's small, but you aren't breathing someone else's stale air for months or years, trying not to hate them. And you got some choices over in prison industries, depending on your case worker's evaluation. Desks, shelves, jeans, uh, vending machine parts. We make a lot of stuff here. Food's awful, but, hell, it's prison. How long have you been in here? 28 years. And I was in Jackson before here. They, uh, called me Righty over there. You can ask. Well, it isn't my business. People who don't ask you what you did are the ones who don't want to talk about what they did. You're a fit guy. Looks like you could handle trouble, but it's better if you ask and better if you tell. You don't want people making assumptions. I've seen guys twice your size picking their teeth out of the shower drain, and I've seen worse. And if you hurt women or kids or something like that, you should come up with a lie right now and stick to it. I ran H and crystal. Some coke. I murdered two men in a stick-up. Shot one of them in the head four times. Was on junk at the time. What floor is my cell on? The scenic. [ Door buzzes ] This is the guy they're putting in seven? Yeah. Bradley Thomas. Before you go in your coffin, there's some rules to apprise you of. Five days a week, I do the count on this floor. If you hear that buzzer go, you come out your room, you wait to be counted. You don't go back until you hear that buzzer again, no matter what. You miss the count... sleep through it, whatever... the rest of the floor waits around for you to be found. It's not a great way to make friends. I do the inspections too. I call out, "Inspection!" You come out your room and you wait outside until I'm through. - You box? - No. Them muscles just for show? Helps me lift stuff. There's a boxing program here, a good one. - I'm one of the coaches. - Not interested. What, you'd rather make desks and parts for vending machines? I'd rather knit baby booties with pink yarn than hit people for no reason. You ever tried? Boxing? I spent some time in the ring when I was younger. Yeah. You get whupped? No. Pay wasn't good enough? You ever hurt somebody? Killed a guy? Pester him some other time. Doors are unlocked when guys are at prison industries or the yard or in class. There's a school here. That's good. This one's yours. I'll leave you alone while you check things out. Dinner's at 6:00. I think I'll skip it today. Lots of guys skip dinner when they first get here. 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, you'll want it. I'll take you to see your case worker tomorrow. Thanks. [ Door locks ] Seven fucking years. Christ. ANDRE: Line up! [ Gate closes ] Someone's missing from the line, so we got to wait! I hope none of you mind. MAN #1: I got a dream I got to get back to. There was a woman. She was plump, but she was willing. ANDRE: We're waiting! Thank you for joining our little get-together, Mr. Thomas. Damn. What happened? Stepped on a bug. You're bullshitting. It was a big one. [ Counter clicking ] That necessary? Pretend like you're talking to God. He doesn't smell like nachos. [ Flashlight clicks ] You're not off to a good start, Mr. Thomas. The whole floor is standing out here in the middle of the night, tired, hungry, waiting for me to finish the count, and you're making jokes. Any more clever remarks? Hmm? You hear that buzzer, you come out and get counted. No delay. Like the bell at the beginning of a boxing match. Ding-ding. Should've told him about the bug.

That gets hard to say after waking up here a thousand times. I bet. Thanks for the candy bar. Told you. Your industry assignments, your visits, all that sort of stuff go through Denise. You want her to like you, so be respectful. And don't look below her neck. And don't make implications. The women in here are real sensitive to that stuff. I smuggled in two kilos of Southern charm. She's got a nice set. [ Chuckles ] [ Knock on door ] DENISE: Come in. I'm Denise Pawther. I'm not sure you want to shake my hand. Next time. You are Bradley Thomas? - Wish I wasn't. - Please, sit. Thanks, ma'am. How was your first night in the Fridge? Lacking in some departments, but I heard this place isn't a reward. Did you sleep? - Some. - Did you eat? Lefty gave me a candy bar. Normally we'd go over your file and discuss your assignments. But I received a call 20 minutes ago that is a priority. From who? Dr. Pelman. Dr. Pelman's your wife's obstetrician. He said there were some complications in the pregnancy and wanted to discuss the matter with you in person. Is, uh... Is it serious? He did not go over details with me. He's coming here? Correct. We've scheduled an appointment at 10:00. Where's Lauren? The hospital? I don't know. We'll finish the orientation tomorrow. Have some breakfast and return to your cell. An officer will come and get you as soon as Dr. Pelman signs in to the outer gate. Have there been difficulties? With our first one, but not this time 'round. [ Sighs ] I appreciate you letting me know. Hope everything goes well. [ Door opens ] [ Knock on door ] [ Cell door opens ] You must be pretty popular. Getting a visitor on your second day. Maybe they came to interview you? See a boxing legend? Walk through slowly. Sending in Bradley Thomas. SEAN: Copy. His guest is at window 10. Have fun. It's that one, Mr. Thomas. Who are you? [ German accent ] Sit down, Mr. Thomas. Where's Dr. Pelman? Sit down. [ Tapping ] Pick up the phone. Remain calm. If you call any attention to us, I will leave. And you will regret my departure for the rest of your life. Nod that you understand. My employer sends his regards. You work for Eleazar. Why are you here? Your betrayal cost my employer $3.2 million. I'm here to settle that matter. There is an abortionist from Korea. He works for my employer. He claims that he can clip the limbs of a fetus yet leave the child in such a condition that it will live to be born. This little operation will only happen if you don't pay your debt to my employer. How? There is a prisoner who my employer wants dead. He is serving a life sentence at the Redleaf Detention Center. I'm in the Fridge for seven years. How in the hell am I supposed to choke out some guy over in Redleaf? Redleaf is maximum security. Show the staff here that you have to be transferred. If I nail this guy, Eleazar will let my wife go unharmed? Yes. Can you give me some sort of guarantee? Certainly. If you don't do what my employer wants you to do, I guarantee you will receive a package with nothing less than two limbs of your unborn child. Sadly, I cannot guarantee if your child will survive or what the fate of your wife will be. Who's this guy I'm supposed to get? Christopher Bridge. And he is in Redleaf Cell Block 99. [ Footsteps departing ] 6'4". Eh, 6'2" at most. 6'4". 6'5". Mm, maybe. You okay? There anything you want to talk about? Look, I'm sorry for busting you earlier. I didn't mean anything by it. I was just hoping to get you in the prison boxing program, you know? What are you doing? Feet hurt. Well, wait till you get back to your coffin, okay? Man, I'm telling you... [ Indistinct shouting in distance ] You don't want to do this. You better stop now. You done fucked up now, redneck. [ Snaps ] [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Door buzzes ] ANDRE: This motherfucker's crazy. [ Footsteps approaching ] - Holy shit. - Hands on your head. Now! LONGMAN: Andre, you okay? ANDRE: What the fuck took you so long? You didn't press the alarm. I interfered with that, but he screams pretty good. Shut the fuck up. Give me a reason to turn your face into a cocktail. Oh, don't scare me like that. I might curl up on the floor like your buddy. I know a joke. Want to hear the punch line? Give him bracelets. Give me your wrists. Dre. Want to get some justice before we take him down? I recommend he uses his right arm. Stay with him. Take this redneck down to the lower level for holding. Walk. Why the hell did you do this? He didn't like my shoes. LONGMAN: Hold it! Hold it! Damn it! [ Spraying ] LONGMAN: Inspect the floor. [ Electricity crackles ] - Nathan. - Yeah? Would you like to give him some justice? You bet. Goddamn nutcase. Hope you like it over in Redleaf. - Longman. - Yeah? How old's Redleaf? Older than you. So, what, '60s? When did they start making that big fuss about humane treatment for prisoners? - DRIVER: Late '50s. - Hmm. Redleaf's from before then. Get vertical. [ Gate opens ] - What's your name? - Sean Waterford. And the name of your prisoner is? Bradley Thomas. You should have received the paperwork earlier. Don't tell me my business. I do things direct, and I have a system. Sorry. This is the fella who likes to beat up officers? Yes. How many of your boys did he take down? Two are in the hospital, a third sustained minor injuries. He whipped three of you? We tried, but... Mr. Thomas. Look at me. The Redleaf Detention Center is classified as a maximum-security facility. But there's another term I prefer... ...one that I think will give you a clearer picture. Minimum freedom. If you make trouble, your minimum freedom will get smaller. So small that it becomes microscopic. Do you understand? - I do. - Put a "sir" on that. I do, sir. Dump that out. The men here aren't like those faggots over there at the Fridge. You can test us if you want to. Prisoners are expensive, and we're only too happy to help the state balance its budget by deploying some cheap lead. Unlock Mr. Thomas so that he can change into his neons. Bad news, Mr. Thomas. Our examination room is under renovation. So you're gonna have to strip out here. Wilson. Give Mr. Thomas a full cavity inspection. [ Handcuffs click ] How about my things? My ring. I'll look for them tomorrow. If I can find the time. This is the transfer from the Fridge. Bradley Thomas. CLERK: Cell block 12. Cell 44. You mean 56. That's what I meant. Read it wrong. It's 56. Take him over. [ Clears throat ] It's up here on your right. The toilet doesn't work, but that doesn't seem to stop people from using it. Hold here. [ Door creaking ] [ Groans softly ] Walk in or get dragged in. Your choice. [ Door locks ] [ Coughs ] Put your hands through. Behave yourself for two weeks, and you'll get another cell. If you go wild like you did in the Fridge, you'll stay in here for years. - [ Fly buzzing ] - [ Coughs ] [ Coughing ] [ Coughing ] [ Footsteps ] [ Bangs on door ] WILSON: Lunch! I can't eat in here. The toilet's full up with shit. WILSON: James, make a note. Prisoner Thomas in 56 refuses to eat. [ Footsteps ] [ Bangs on door ] WILSON: Thomas! BRADLEY: Yeah? WILSON: Put your shirt on if you want to go to the yard. Come out and shut the door. You get 60 minutes. Behave and you'll get more. You go wild, you'll live in that cell 24 hours a day. My name's Derrick. Bradley. - I'm gonna go work out. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You do not want to get near those guys. I have some questions. Ask. Do you know a guy named Christopher Bridge, inmate in here? I-I haven't heard of him. Which one of these guys are from Cell Block 99? None of them. Where are they? Isolated from the rest of the prison. Who do they keep in there? Child molesters, rapists, guys with death sentences, psychotics. [ Indistinct conversations ] Hey, whoa. W-W-Where are you going? Brad, Brad, what's wrong with you? It's Bradley. And I'm psychotic. Hey, hey, hey, hey, just... just... I'm gonna use that one. We're using it now, gringo. Don't call me a foreigner. Last time I checked, the colors of the flag weren't red, white, and burrito. Want to start some stuff, huh? I'm more of a finisher. [ Chuckles ] Loco en la cabeza. That's right. I'm loco. Now, get the fuck out of my crazy way. [ Gunshots ] [ Gun cocks ] OFFICER: Drop the barbell! The next shot goes into a skull! Put your hands in the air and back away from each other. Walk to the wall. MAN: Maurizio? Lo mal que es? Maurizio? Walk to the wall now! Maurizio needs help! [ Coughs, grunts ] What'd you do? [ Cracking ] [ Guns cock ] Thomas. Show us 10 fingers or we'll shoot. [ Crack ] [ Cocks ] You just lost your minimum freedom. You're going to 99. [ Chains rattle ] Open it wide. Close it behind us. Make sure he doesn't trip on his chains. You're gonna have to be more careful. I suspect that Amnesty International would frown upon the contents of this room. Cell Block 99 is the prison within the prison. You will stay down here until you're sorted out. Or carried out. Stand him up. For the next month, you'll wear this. Turn it on. Each time you misbehave, you earn five points. Each point gets you one of these. [ Click, electricity buzzing ] - [ Groaning ] - [ Click, buzzing stops ] You currently have 25 points. These shall be dispensed to you over the coming week. When you are eating, when you are sleeping, when you are pissing, and when you are shitting. Mr. Thomas. [ Gate unlocks ] You want to be mindful of the broken glass. [ Click, electricity buzzing ] [ Click, buzzing stops ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Exhales slowly ] Who's there? My employer has asked me to take a few more pictures. [ Camera shutter clicks ] Is that him? - [ Camera shutter clicks ] - That's the abortionist. He is here to perform a preliminary examination. [ Voice breaking ] No. You can't. You can't. [ Crying ] This a baby girl we're talking about. It is lamentable that she didn't have smart parents. [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Door opens, closes in distance ] Christopher Bridge? [ Clears throat ] Christopher Bridge! Who? Christopher Bridge. Never heard of him. I'm looking for a guy named Chris Bridge. MAN: There ain't no guy named Christopher Bridge in here. Never has been. - Now shut up! - Are you sure about... [ Electricity buzzing ] JEREMY: There. In this one. Get up, Mr. Thomas. [ Door opens ] Into the hall. Look at me. I'd prefer the stun belt. [ Electricity buzzing ] [ Buzzing stops ] Look at me. Do not blink until I give you permission to blink. That's funny. [ Electricity buzzing ] [ Buzzing stops ] It's easy to hit this button. And we got a closet full of batteries. Look at me. Do not blink until I give you permission to blink. That's good. A few inmates requested a little face time with you. And I know how you like to socialize. - Who? - Friends of yours. Walk down the hall. Go slow.

Your heroics cost me $3.2 million, as well as my freedom for an undetermined period of time, and because of you, my sister is now a widow. Her husband was Pedro, whom you shot in the back. Let my wife go. You and I can settle this however. [ Click, electricity buzzing ] Mirame, blanco. [ Coughs, groans ] A few hours ago, I received this photo. You might like it. [ Click, electricity buzzing ] I'll... ...tear [Grunts] ...your head off. [ Click, buzzing stops ] [ Breathing heavily ] Now listen to me very carefully. If you harm me or any of my associates, the abortionist will sever the limbs from your little girl. It's a long, slow payback, blanco.

[ Electricity buzzing ] - [ Buzzing stops ] - SAM: Chow time for 99! [ Electricity buzzing ] [ Buzzing stops ] Here you go. MAN #1: This shit smells like a cab driver! SAM: Here. MAN #2: I've tasted worse. SAM: I like your attitude. [ Door slot opens ] You want to eat something? If you don't like it, dump it in the shithole. Okay. And any mess you make is one you get to live with. I'm not a maid. You got utensils? Plastics or whatever? MAN: Hey, big guy. You feeling okay? A little south of okay. You were raving for a while. You have a fever? Did. How come the guards are after you? Hurt one of them. Broke his arm. Why are you in here? I did some things I'm not proud of. Where are you from? South somewhere? I am. Is it nice down there? For most folks, it is. I don't have a heap of great memories from back then. They're helpful. What are? Memories. Keep you sane in a place like this. I spend a lot of time just reliving the good parts. How long you been in here? - Eight years. - That's rough. They still let you up to see visitors? People don't want to visit me. - How about you? - How about me what? MAN: Do you have people who still care about you on the outside? A few. Two that really matter. You have a wife? Yeah. She gonna wait for you? She would have. [ Click, electricity buzzing ] [ Footsteps ] [ Buzzing stops ] WILSON: Wake up, Mr. Thomas. Your buddies want to socialize. Into the hall. Close that. I'd like to let the place air out. It smells like shit and dinner. That wasn't a suggestion. When I autograph that cast, should I make it out to Mr. or Mrs. Bitch? [ Click, electricity buzzing ] [ Groans ] I bet your kidneys don't enjoy your jokes. Get the gun! [ Clicks ] Give me the keys. WILSON: Run! Get help. He can't get you with those chains on his ankles. [ Grunting ] He will be choked out cold by the time you get back. Dead. It'll be on you. Give me the keys. - Don't give him... - Quiet. Let him loose. Fuck no. Give me the keys. You can't get out of Redleaf. Walk those over. [ Crunches ] You stupid, stupid asshole. You killed him. I know what I did. Get in. MAN: Don't feed him. Make it so he has to eat his friend in order to stay alive. JEREMY: Warden Tuggs will kill you for this. Him or somebody else. MAN: Get his gun. It's broken. [ Door opens in distance ] Take his stunner. It's over there. I'm not gonna stun these guys. Can I have it, then? I could... I could really use it in here. Thanks. Good luck.

Fuck you, gringo. M.P.V.: [ Grunts ] Aaaah! [ Crack ] ROMAN: Blanco. It's especially tragic when parents lose a child. My condolences. If you do not hear from me in 10 minutes, commence the abortionist. If you have not heard from me within the hour, dismantle the mother and flush her down the toilet. [ Cellphone beeps ] If you want your wife and child to survive, you better listen to me. Call them off. Go back to your cell, or your baby's dead. You don't have a choice. [ Coughing ] You're wrong about that. They will not listen to you. That's fine. You're the one that's gonna be making noise. Call off your guy. Return to your cell. We'll do this the other way. I will make no such phone call. [ Groaning ] Tell me your code or it's the other leg. 7-7-7. Howdy. Is this that creep that visited me at the Fridge? I want you to hear something. [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] Aah! [ Groans ] I already hurt Eleazar serious. Right now I'm dragging him to a bunch of guys who will fuck him bloody. I don't want to do this, but I will. I think you know by now I can get mean. ELEAZAR: Brad. - Bradley. - Bradley. I will tell them to release your wife. They need to turn her over to Gil so that I can confirm she's okay. Talk correct or get raped. Plans have changed. [ Handcuffs click ] JEREMY: You're not gonna get away with this. BRADLEY: Stay put, or I'll break your neck. [ Door opens ] Warden Tuggs. Mr. Thomas. - Where's Wilson? - In my cell. And I have two other hostages... Eleazar and your guy Jeremy. Try and open that gate or gas me, I'll murder them both. MAN #1: He'll do it! MAN #2: Efficiently! Just what do you think you're gonna accomplish here? I'm waiting for a phone call. One minute after I'm off, I will turn myself over to you. And I swear that to Jesus Christ and heaven above. - Wilson. - He's not gonna answer you. Jeremy? JEREMY: Yeah? - You okay? - I'm not dead. How soon before this call comes through? Soon.

What's going on there? Don't worry about what's going on over here. I'm fine. I'm calling to check on you and the koala, make sure you're safe. Hear your voice. It's all just so unreal, the kidnapping and everything that they tried to do. I think it's over now. Do you want to say something to the koala? Sure, I would. I'd love to say something to her. Here she is. I wish I could be there for you and your mother, but, uh... ...I know you'll have a good life. You'll grow up... ...healthy and smart. [ Exhales sharply ] I just felt her move. I don't know what you said. Thank you for [Sniffles] letting me talk to her. You're welcome. We want to come see you. When can we come see you?
