Mr. Stenza... Please, call me Theodore. Maybe it’s best if we keep this formal. I’m afraid, Mr. Stenza, that we are out of options. Out of options? I mean, there’s always options. You’ve defaulted on your payment. Sir, I was laid off. I’ve been on more job interviews than you could ever imagine. Then all of the sudden the job interviews started to dry up. You’d think after 40 years of engineering experience that might mean something, but to them it was... that I’m old. I’m not old. And, sir... I haven’t given up. Well, I admire your persistence, but... Please, listen. Let’s just make a deal. I’m told you already worked one out with my predecessor. Then let’s make another deal! Please, let’s make another deal! My wife and I have worked our entire lives to make that house our home. For our family... for our son. And ever since I lost them, that house is all I have left of them. Look, I’m sorry, but it’s out of my hands. You have 35 days to vacate the premises. Mr. Stenza... do you understand? Oh, Mr. Stenza! It says here that you are a veteran? Thank you for your service. Mitch! Yeah? No, wait, let me guess. One of your friends is pregnant again. Better. Better, uh... twins! Speaking of babies, what’s the one thing that’s stopping us from having one? We’ve been married for three months. Cold. We want to enjoy each other and have enough fun to last a lifetime before we do? Colder. Our dream house. There’s my smart husband. Mm-hmm. And... there it is. Foreclosure? Hmm, that is a far cry from our dream house. This is more house than we’d be able to afford for the next five years. It’s a perfect first home for us. For our family. The auction is tomorrow. Which means maybe not a lot of people know about it. Plus, we’ve already talked to the bank and we know what we’ve been approved for. Ugh. I don’t know, honey, I don’t think we’re ready. Okay, then, when will we be? It’s a scary, huge adult life step. And that is what married people do. They take a bunch of adult life steps together. Let’s at least try, huh? You bid up to the number the bank gave us and maybe we get lucky. Okay, I’ll go. Yes! Oh hey, that bracelet looks mighty nice on you. Uh-oh. Besides, you are my sun, my moon, and my stars. All right, folks, you are going to love me for this one. Next up is the residence at 1319 Redwood, Los Angeles. Do I hear 425? I got 425, do we hear 430? 430, bidder, bidder, 430, 430, 430, bidder at 430. Bidder 425 going once, 425 going twice... 430. Going to need to speak up, son. 430. 430, got 430. Do I hear 433... I got 433. 433. 435! 435, new bid’s 435, 435, 435. Okay, 435 going once, 435 going twice... 438. 438 is a new bid, 438, 440, 440, 440, bidder 440, bidder, bidder, bidder. 440, 440, 440? Okay, 438 going once, 438 going twice. Sold. Congratulations, son. Thank you. Ah, let me guess, you went over your target number. By the price of approximately one honeymoon. Oh, newlyweds! Yeah. That you got the house. It’s kind of a silver lining. Thank you. You own a bank sale. And bad life choices lose them everything, but it means that a nice, lovely young couple such as yourselves get to start their lives out properly. Then it’s not so tragic. That’s a way of looking at it. Okay, enough of my rambling. Go tell that wife of yours the good news. I will. And thanks again, I really appreciate this. What the hell? Ahh! No, no, no, don’t worry about me, I’ve got this. Damn, girl, you been working out? I know. You need help? No, I got it. Hey, be careful, please. I’m three feet off the ground. I think I’m going to be okay. Now, are you sure you want this down? Oh, I have big plans for this porch. Is there any part of the house that you don’t have big plans for? My office. I have even bigger plans for that. Oh, okay, look at you. Could you, uh... Oh, yeah, sorry. Thank you. Yeah. Such a gentleman! You know. You know me! Are you as happy as I am? I am. And a little overwhelmed. Is that good? Mostly. It’s a lot. I think I need a raise. And you need more patients. I just hope we’re up for this. We will be. We’ve got a whole lifetime to work on it. What are you thinking about? How weird it is to look to my right and not see the kitchen. It’s a little late for a welcome party. Hmm. Can I help you? I know it’s late. Forgive me so much for intruding on you guys, but I’m Theodore. Theodore Stenza? This used to be my home. Mitch? Umm, Mr. Stenza, we’re about go to bed. I realize that. I just wanted to say good-bye. Is that okay? Of course, Mr. Stenza. Yeah. Please, come in. Thank you so much. Yeah. Well, I must confess that I’m not here to exchange pleasantries, Mr. Bordine. I’ve been talking to all of my cousins and my aunts and my uncles, and we believe we can raise the money right up to about what you guys paid. Um... I’m sorry, are you saying you want to... Buy my house back. Please. Listen, I, I completely understand where you’re coming from, but... Do you, really? Young man, you and your lovely wife are just getting started. You have your entire lives to build beautiful, loving memories together. This is all I have left of my wife. My family. I literally built this house for us. This is the life we built together. So, please, let me buy my house back. When you did you lose your wife? Five years ago, yesterday. And when I’m in here, it’s as if she never left. It can be hard, saying good-bye. That’s why I don’t want to have to. I understand. I understand how it feels when a door closes. Especially if we don’t know how, where, or when the next door will open. Fear, insecurity, even panic. Well, I’m not scared, I’m not panicking. I know, because you are one of those people who makes things happen. For people like you, who are persistent, another door does always open. I want my house back. It’s just that simple. And I can be persistent. Look, you’re right, I don’t know what it’s like to lose my house or... my wife. You know, I feel for you, sir, I really do. But we can’t sell you this house. Even if we wanted to, after closing costs and moving costs and everything else, we’d be going in the hole. So, I’m sorry, but this is our house now. I understand. Well, under the circumstances, I can’t say I wish you all the best. But I do respect the both of you, and I respect your decision. You’re persistent, like me. I will look for that open door. Just like you said, doc. Oh, by the way, the third step on those stairs, it squeaks. Used to be on my to-do list and I guess now it’s on your to-do list. Yeah, I’ll get on that. Forgive me for the intrusion. It’s okay. Yeah, good night. - Good night. - Good night. Well, that was a fun night in. Mitch, he’s lost. I feel bad for him. Yeah, well, we’re finally not lost. Okay, we have a home. So, I feel bad for him, I wish him well, but can we just settle into our lives and not worry about everyone else’s? Okay? Okay. I’m sorry. Okay. There was something in his eyes. He’s really hurting, Mitch. It’s a shame. I just hate being the reason why another person is so sad. We’re not the reason! In school we learned about depression and ways it can lead to sociopathic behavior. You talk to him for all of five minutes and he’s a depressed sociopath? No, I’m just saying he believes we stole his house. We don’t know this man. Or what he’s capable of. Yeah, well, I know what I’m capable of. Wow. Really? Do these cheesy lines work on your wife? All the time. All the time. I won’t let them take you away from me. It’s so much better doing it in your own house. Maybe because we don’t have to worry about the neighbors hearing? I think it’s the space. Now I have enough room for all of my sweet moves. Gah. Oh hey, I’m going to be home late tomorrow. I’m putting in some OT. I’ve had a mortgage all of one day and I already know why my dad had ulcers. I will be busy putting finishing touches on the home office, getting ready for my very first client in my very own office. Ooh, you’re going to be great. And the office looks great. I’m really proud of you, babe. Well, I can’t have my husband getting ulcers. Not until we have a daughter or two, that is. All right. Good night. Hey, just be home by 8:00 tomorrow, okay? I will be cooking us our very first home-cooked meal. Home-cooked right here in our home. You know, most people would find that whole repeating the word home thing over and over again annoying. But not this guy, I actually enjoy it. Bring it on. Oh, okay, I was thinking about making steak and home fries, maybe. One more. We can invite our homies. That’s the one. There we go. Thank you. You’re welcome. - Good night. - Night. Huh. Hey, this is Mitch Bordine. Please leave a message and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can. Hey, babe. You put the porch swing back up, huh? I like it. Be nice to sit out here one day and watch our four children frolicking on the lawn. I had to, I’m sorry. Couldn’t resist. I love you. It was a great first night. Well, he’s, he’s handling it. You know Mitch, he tries to be cool but I can sense when he’s anxious. We’re enjoying just the two of us for now, Mom. Yes, for now. For now is as long as I want it to be. I swear, if you bring up grandkids once this weekend... Mom! My house, my rules. Yeah, it does actually feel pretty good to say that. Now I know why you and Dad said it every time you had the chance. I’m in the kitchen. I’ll send you a video. I love you too. See you Saturday. Oh, thank goodness! You were anxious about the GPS again. Yeah, you can’t trust them. I have nightmares all of the time I’m going to drop the kids off at the wrong babysitter. Would you like to come inside? Sure. So, how do you like the new office? It’s nice. I’m the one who fought for this new house. I can already see my husband stressing about it. And every time he does, I have to fight the guilt away. How do you do it? Well, I try to keep in mind that every person is free to make their own decisions and I am not responsible for them. Does it work? Sometimes. The thing about emotion, Tori, is that it feels real because it’s here. Our brain knows that the emotion is false, but our body refuses to listen. Which is why we let the feeling happen, we let it wash over us, we let it run through us. And, when it’s done, we let the brain take back over. The last thing we do is let the emotion take control. Sounds really hard. It is a fight every day, Tori. Would you like to work on some exercises? All right, let’s breathe in for five. In, one, two, three, four, five. Hold, and out, two, three, four, five. Good job. We let it do whatever it’s going to do and then we assert our control. You really feel guilty about this whole husband thing, huh? You’re deflecting. This isn’t about my husband, Tori. It’s about to be. I’ll see you on Tuesday. Night! Bye. Okay, where were we? No! No! No, no! Hey, babe. You put the porch swing back up, huh? I like it. Be nice to sit out here one day and watch our four children frolicking on the lawn. I love you. Hi, this is Erica Bodine. Leave a message. What’s going on there, baby-baby? I’m just calling to wish you good luck today. Also, I don’t know what you’re talking about with the swing. It was down when I left. I think. I honestly don’t remember. If this is your way of telling me you want it back up, I’m okay with that. I kind of like the idea of us sitting there waiting for the nursing home to call. Okay, I will see you when I get home. I love you. Okay, bye. I didn’t think you were going to struggle so much. I mean, I don’t know why I thought that, but of course, of course you would struggle. Of course. Mr. Stenza? Everybody’s calling me that now. I can call you whatever you want. Thank you for being so accommodating. I just want to know what you want. What I want? I thought I was perfectly clear of what I wanted. I wanted my life back! I wanted my life back! Didn’t I ask you? Didn’t I beg you the very same thing? Didn’t I? Yes. Didn’t I tell you that I would pay to get my life back? And then what did you guys say? What did you say? You said, go to hell! No, no, we didn’t say that. You made me do this! I did it, I really did it. What? Did what? I took you. This is bigger than the both of us now. And now that it’s started, I can’t go back. No, of course you can. Of course you can! I am not going to tell anybody that this happened. We can, we can start from the beginning and we can, we can work together to get your life back. Just untie me and, and open that door, and then we can go out there and we can just talk. You think that I’m one of those nut jobs that you work with, don’t you? Don’t you? Well, let me tell you something, young lady, I am a model citizen. I paid my taxes, my head is screwed on straight, and this is my home! We need to talk. No more talking! We can talk about anything, anything you want! We can talk and, and we make it better. No. I don’t want this for you, Mr. Stenza. I’m sure your family wouldn’t want this for you, either. What do you know about my family? I’m sure that they love you. You don’t talk about my family. You started this. When you start something, you see it all the way to the end. You understand that, missy? I’m going to take everything away from you. I am going to do to you what you did to me. I didn’t do anything to you. I’m taking everything away, piece by piece. First... a little phone call. And then I’m texting your hubby. Oh, hey, Ms. Moran. I’m glad you stopped by. I was checking the numbers... Mitch. There’s a police officer waiting for you in the conference room. Oh, is everything all right? He was polite, no sense of urgency. But, Mitch, I really don’t appreciate my employees’ private lives walking into my business requesting a private room to ask a few questions. Straighten it out. Yeah, yes. I’ll, I’ll get on that. Umm, sorry. Thank you. You want to take a seat, Mitch? Um... is there a problem? That’s what we’re going to find out. You know, when a cop asks you if you want to take a seat, he’s not really asking. You know how to work a tablet, Mitch? Yeah. Great, unlock that bad boy and take a gander at the first picture, will you? I would do it myself, but, you know, sticky fingers. Ah, code? Oh, right. It’s one... two... three-four-five. Not a great code, I know, but it’s the only one I can remember. Besides, anyone who steals a cop’s tablet has got to be too dumb to guess it, right? You know that guy? Yeah, I bid on our house from him. Sorry, I don’t remember his name. Sims. Jonathan Michael Sims. Okay, do you want to tell me what this is all about? You know, it’s never as easy as I’d like to be. Okay, here’s what we’re going to do... you and me are just going to sit here for a little bit like a couple of old pals. After all, if it turns out I’m wrong, I’d like you to still have a job. I’m sorry, are you arresting me for something? Mitch, Mitch, come on. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I mean, unless you want to confess something. Confess to what? Mr. Sims died the night you won your house. Hit and run. That, that’s terrible. Yeah. You drive a Dodge, right? Yeah. Stratus, blue, right? Yes! Well, there was a fabric sample in the grill of your car... that at least on the eyeball test seems to be from the shirt he was wearing that night. Wait, wait, wait. You, you searched my car? Well... it’s in the parking lot. Public property. And we didn’t have to search it, the fabric was there flapping in the breeze for all to see. Not really smart, if you ask me. So, you tell me. If you were a cop... would you be suspicious? Well, I don’t know what’s going on, because I didn’t do anything. You know, the problem with you saying that, Mitch, is that’s exactly what somebody who did do something would say. So, look... let’s just you and me wait here until the lab calls me about that little swatch of fabric. Sound good? Excellent. Damn it! Must have felt pretty good, walking around your old house again. Yeah. It was wonderful, even with all that tacky furniture you guys put inside there. But all those wonderful memories are still there. Mr. Stenza, what’s next? I told you, I want your husband to feel like I do. That’s why he’s being arrested right now for a hit and run. What?! He will lose his job, he’ll have a conviction on his record. And whenever he gets out of prison, whenever that’s going to be, well, he will be unemployable. You know, you take everything away from a man, you take away his livelihood. And that’s going to happen to Mitch soon enough. I’m trying to help you, Mr. Stenza. When you threaten me, I get scared and that doesn’t further either of our goals. I wouldn’t really know about that, because right now I’m feeling pretty good. Well, if it’s threats you like, then let me tell you this right now: if you hurt my husband, I will do whatever it takes to cut you into pieces! Do you understand me? Wow! You’ve got fight in you. Untie me and I’ll show you how much. Hey, you remind me... I don’t care who I remind you of! Let me out of here! No. I built this room for my son, Max. He loved it here. This was his playroom. Daddy, you want to go play games down there? It’s my favorite room, Daddy. I love my safe place room, Daddy. Oh, I see. Now you’re all clammed up. Before, you were Chatty Cathy, trying to get me to talk all the time, and now you’re all boarded up, huh? Like a virgin on prom night. Let me go. No. My son, he loved to play games. He couldn’t say pick-up truck. So we’d play the game hiccup twuck. I’d put the truck right here. In the middle of the room on the rug. And then I would count to three: one, two, three. And whoever could grab it first, would win. Daddy, I won. I won, Daddy! He was a champ. I never won. You sound like you’re a good father. Yeah. You know, my son, he had a lot of fight in him. A lot of fight! And I had to tell him that when he was in the hospital. You keep fighting, son. You make strong, you keep fighting, son! I will, Daddy. I will keep fighting, Daddy. That had to be so hard for you. You’ll never know. But I can see the pain you’re in. He was six years old. He was six years old! So, what would you know about pain like that, huh? I know that talking about it can help. Do you want to talk about it? No, no, Theodore, please. Please! Who is that? It’s Dan, it’s one of my patients. He’s on the schedule. If you say anything, this adventure ends for all of us. You understand? Dan, hi! Dr. Bordine, hey, I’m here. I didn’t want to knock because, you know, the thing. Dan, I’m sorry, I need to cancel today. Sorry, that’s not going to work for me. Dan, I’m sick. So am I, that’s why I’m here. You know I can’t have... You shouldn’t have done that. Dan has extreme OCD, he has a method for ending phone calls. No, no, stop, no! Stop it, no, no! No! Who are you? Sorry, appointment cancelled for today. Wait, no, see, because she didn’t call me. She’s sick. But she said she was going to call me if she ever needed to cancel. For whatever reason, see, that was our deal. You know, sometimes life throws you curveballs, buddy. See, that’s the thing. I live my life in ways so I don’t get curve balls. It’s not a choice, you know? Listen... Who are you, again, anyway? Where is Erica? I’m her husband and I’m taking care of her, okay? You’re Mitch Bordine? That is correct. You’re not him. I am. The photo of Erica and her husband of three months, Mitch, on her website says otherwise. What the hell is going on here? I want to talk to Dr. Bordine! Ooh! No, no, no! Sorry, my wife hasn’t texted me back. Marital troubles? No, she’s a psychologist, she’s with patients. Are you one of her patients, Mitch? Is everything I say to you going to be something you find suspicious? Should it be? Well, I guess we’re about to find out. Go for Ivie. Mm-hmm. Okay, thank you. Yeah, bye. Mitch, looks like you and I have two choices. The first one is I escort you to the parking lot and put cuffs on there. The second choice is way less pleasant and far more embarrassing. So, you, you’re arresting me. The samples matched, Mitch. Well, it has to be planted, because I didn’t hit anybody. You know, you’re starting to sound like a guy who is hell bent on option B. You really want everyone in this office to see me restrain and put cuffs on you? I am innocent. That’s what court is for. Do I look like someone who would lie to you about this? Do I look like someone who cares? Now, you need to pull it together, pal, right now. And you need to take a little walk with me. Last chance. Let’s go. Now. I’m impressed. You are a fighter. You know, my wife was a fighter. Yeah. So, the, uh... situation with your patient makes me realize that maybe you were right. Yeah. Yeah. So, why don’t you come on out and let’s talk about it, huh? I need your help. It’s something that I would never ask for, but I’m asking you now. Please, come and help me. Please, please, somebody help me! Watch your head. Say again, we have a two-forty at 1319 Redwood Court. Witness saw an Asian female in her 20s screaming for help and being held against her will by a man. Long hair, 6’3"... Hey! 1319... Hey! Redwood. Calm down. Look, man, you want to explain to me why you want to add resisting arrest to all the other charges you’re already facing? What’s a two-forty? The radio? 1319 Redwood, that’s my house. They just said a woman was screaming outside of my house. That’s my wife! You don’t know that. Dispatch, please repeat the description of suspect. Long hair, 6 feet 3 inches. Oh my God. This is him, this is all him! Mr. Bordine... Theodore Stenza, the owner of the house before me. This has got to be him! Now, what is a two-forty? Assault. Unit 21 responding. Sit down. Sit down! I knew this guy in the war, he did a Wild West show. Fast draw kind of stuff, you know? I bugged him every night to teach me how to do that stuff. So I’m telling you, young lady, you try another trick like you just did, this knife is going to be in my hand and in the middle of your chest before you can make two steps toward that door over there. You understand me? Big man with a big knife, right? You got me this time, but it ain’t happening again. You play baseball? Softball? Hoo, girl, you got a home run swing, man. Got some skills, got potential. What would your son say about all this? About the monster you’ve become? Nothing. Your son died, so you get to kill whoever you want. Your wife died, so you get to hurt and scare people. You lost your house, so you can toss away right and wrong like a bloody towel? I’m sorry, Theodore. A million people deal with things like this every day, and none of them use it as an excuse. You and your fancy schools. Therapists know it all, huh? You’re in the word business and you can’t even get that straight. All you do is talk for a living, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! Try doing something with your hands! Stop it! You use my family as an excuse one more time, you’re done. I apologize. You have lost and I am so sorry for all that you’ve been through. It’s hell on Earth. And you’re right, I don’t know how that feels. You will. Life reveals who we truly are, eventually, and always. You got your house back, Theodore. Just let me go and you can get back to your life. My life is over. No one is saying that! I’m saying it. I am saying you’ve won! I’ve won? Does this look like a victory lap to you? Huh? My son thought I was a winner. You’re a winner, Daddy, just like in the movies. Did you watch movies with your son, Theodore? All the time. When he was sick. Then tell me this... if Max were watching this movie right now, would he think you were the good guy or the bad guy? I never wanted this to happen like this. I’m a good guy. No, no! Good people don’t hold others against their will! And they don’t murder people! I’m a good guy, I’m a good guy! I’m a good guy. I’m a good guy, I’m a good guy, I’m a good guy! I’m a good guy! Good guy, I’m a good guy! Sit down. Answer it, sell it. Cops, whoever it is, tell them you’re fine and sell it. Erica, hi. This is Detective Ivie, LAPD. I’m doing a wellness check. Over the phone? Well, you can’t expect us to make the drive out to every house, right? I just need verbal confirmation. Are you okay? Yes, I’m okay. Do you need medical attention? No. You’re not being held against your will? Erica? No, not being held against my will. Great. Just one more question... what’s your mother-in-law’s name? Dottie. How’s your mom? Sheila, I think, Mitch said her name was. She’s fine, officer. Sheila’s doing just fine. Erica, could you put Theodore on the phone, please? He wants to talk to you. Mr. Stenza, this is Detective Ivie with the Los Angeles Police Department. How are we doing in there? We? Yes, we. We are in this together. We’re just peachy. Look, I understand that you’re angry. I would be, too. I mean, you had a whole plan, and now that plan is sideways and you’re feeling like you’re drowning. But I’m here to tell you that you’re not. You see, this is your chance to just grab my hand, get out of the water, and still get to live a life. No, there’s no way out. There’s always a way out. We sometimes just don’t see it. Who the hell are you to talk to me, huh? Hey, I get it, we don’t know each other. But I’m here to help, nothing more than that, okay, Theodore? I tried to do it the right way my entire life, I truly did. I know you did. And now I’m going to do it my way. Look, I’m a cop, Mr. Stenza. I’ve seen a million of these cases. Backup is on the way, but you know LA traffic, right? What the hell are you doing? Is Erica okay? Is my wife okay? So it could be a while longer, but here’s the thing, they have to take any deal I give them. So, if you hurry up and hash this out with me right now, I can get you more than those bums would ever give you. I know those stalling tactics. You ever thought about being a therapist, huh, Ivie? You’d have hit it out of the park. A therapist doesn’t have what I have, Theodore, a get out of jail free card. I’m listening. So am I. What is it that you want? What do I need to give you so that you let Erica go and we all walk out of here happy and healthy? What is it that I want? Let’s make it happen. I want my house back, that’s what I want! Hey, hey, done. Really? Just like that? My friend, I’ve got Mitch down here in handcuffs. He’ll sell, a good price, too. Is that going to do it for you? Let me think about it for a moment. Well, don’t take too long, I’m worried I see red and blue lights in the distance. Well, that was nice, Ivie. What was? Believing that maybe this was all real. It is real. Good-bye. Theodore, do not hang up. What? What is going on? Come on. Come on, let’s go. Get up, we’re moving. My wife loved that kitchen. She made the best French toast in there. We moved the coffee maker closer to the refrigerator because it was easier to get to the milk. I can move it back. You shouldn’t have hung up on him. You keep on sounding like you think there’s hope. The police are talking to you. Why isn’t there hope? Because I’m done talking to the police. And I’m done talking to you. Dispatch, this is unit 21 with the two-forty. We’ve got an escalating situation here at 1319 Redwood. Can I get an ETA on backup? No, stop, Theodore, stop! Theodore, stop! No! Please! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, stop! He’s got Erica! Damn it. No, I’m going in there. Why, why? So we can have two hostages? Backup is a couple of minutes away! Backup!? Did you hear her? She doesn’t have a couple of minutes! Tell me I’m wrong. Does she have a couple of minutes? I don’t know. Man, if you don’t let me in there, I swear to God. Mitch... He’s already killed one person. I’m not going to stand here while that psycho does whatever he wants to my wife. I need permission to enter your home. What? Otherwise, I have to wait for a warrant. Do I have your permission? Yeah, hell yeah, you do! Keys, keys, keys. And I’m going to need you back in the car. I can’t just have you standing out here. Please. Do not let him hurt her. Just turn on my headlights. Dispatch, this is unit 21. I’m breaching the residence. Attention all units, I’m going in. Argh! Please, no, Theodore, don’t! Theodore... they’ll take it easy on you if you just stop this. Right now, right here. It’s not too late. Just put the gun down and I will tell them that you let me go. Theodore, please. Backup is imminent, wait for additional units to arrive. Repeat, wait on the additional units. Don’t! Mr. Stenza! LAPD! Come out with your hands up! I do not want to hurt you! Erica. Don’t move. It was either this or a play jet. I told my son, son, a play jet might be more fun. You could fly it here, fly it there, land it anywhere. A pickup truck just goes back and forth. Do you know what he said to me? No, I don’t. He said, Daddy, red is my favorite color. 21. Unit 21, position. Backup is two minutes away. The kitchen, first floor, back of the house. Erica, want to play a game? Sit down. No. Erica, sit down. What the hell? No. No, no, no, turn around, turn around! This isn’t your safe place anymore, Theodore. The police are going to walk in that door and they will do whatever it takes to get me out safely. My wife made this mobile for our son. He loved space. He wanted to be an astronaut. They will come in here and they will see that body. She worked on it for about two weeks. He said his truck could fly to the moon. They will kill you. I don’t want that to happen. This isn’t a game. Right, game. Sounds like things are getting real torn up, up there. It was a pickup truck. He couldn’t say it, so he called it his red hiccup truck. What are you...? I would count one, two, three... and whoever could grab it first won. No, no. I never won. Please. Oh my God. One... No. Two... Stop, please. Please don’t make me do this! Please! Hey, it’s me! It’s me, hey. Three. Ahh! Erica! Hey! Jesus Christ. Erica? Erica. You’re safe now. Mitch, get down here. Erica! Come on, then. Let’s get you out of here, okay? Mitch? Erica? Mitch. I love you! Are you okay? Are you okay? All units on scene, with multiple casualties. Scene is secured. Clear a path here. ASD reporting back to base. Oh, Dan! Oh my God. Hey, hey. There’s nothing you could have done. Hey, look at me. Hey. If you weren’t as strong as you are, there would be three of those, okay? I love you so much. Hey, um, I thought you might like something warm to drink. Careful, it’s hot. Thank you. Sure. He’s dead, right? Yes, he is. He didn’t give you a choice. You impress me, Mrs. Bordine. You’re a very brave woman. And just so you know, we have counselors, therapists, who are trained to handle these situations. Handle. Have any of them ever killed someone? I don’t know the answer to that, but I know that you did what you had to do in order to survive. Bad things happen to good people. You’re a good person. I’m just glad we didn’t lose you. And I thought you agreed to stay in the car. Well, don’t I look like someone who would lie to you? You do now. You sure do. Mitch, I don’t think I can stay here. If you think I could sleep through one more night here, you’re crazy. This is our home. And it was his. No, it’s just a house. We’ll find another one.
