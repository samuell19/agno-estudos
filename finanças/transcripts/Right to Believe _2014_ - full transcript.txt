Morris! - Hey, what's up, boss? - Get in here now, andclose the door behind you! - Okay. what's up? - Sit down. What's up? You wantto me what's up? Well, I'll tellyou what's up. I just got off the phonewith the brass upstairs, and they ripped me a new one. Do you know why theyripped me a new one? - I don't have a clue. - The mayor'soffice is calling, and he's saying that he nevergave you that quote on the pritchett scandal. - What? - He says he never saidit, never thought it, never even dreamed it. - He gave methat quote, Terry. - Prove it.- How? - Do you have iton your recorder? Was there machine else therepresent who can confirm your story? - When have you ever knownme to lie on a story, Terry? - I'm not callingyou a liar, Tony, but you messed up this time,and it's come down on me. - I did my job, igot that story 100%. The mayor gave me that quote. - But you can't prove it. We're going to haveto print a retraction. - Are you serious? - We're going toprint a retraction, and you're going to write it. - No, I'm notgoing to write it. - What part of theboss/employee relationship are you having the mosttrouble understanding? If you tell me what you'regoing to do and not do, that would make you the boss. Me boss, you employee. Boss says write a retraction,and we'll print it. You employee will also writea letter of apology to the mayor and send it. We won't print that one,but you will send it. Unless you want this to bean ex boss/ex boss employee relationship.- Terry... - This is notgoing away, Tony. I'll try to bury theretraction in the back pages somewhere, but thiswill be printed. In the meantime, you're goingto lay low for a while. - What is this? - I'm putting you on alittle fluff piece for the community section. - Terry, I can't, I've gotmy hands full at the wilcox trial. - Not anymore. Mitch is taking overthe wilcox trial. - That's my story. I've been following him sincehe got arrested, all right? You can't justtake me off of it. - I can, and I am. Mitch will handlethe wilcox trial. You'll do thiscommunity piece. - Community piece? Oh, no, these are fornewbies all right? I've been here six years. - And if you want to stayhere another six minutes, I strongly suggest you takethis and shut your mouth. - Oh, this is unbelievable. - My hands aretied here, Tony. I went out on a limb foryou on that mayor thing, and look what happened. - I didn't doanything wrong. - You fail toback yourself up, and you knowbetter than that. Especially when you'redealing with a politician. I gotta take ahard line on this. - Terry... - No, no, no! This conversation is over. Take this andget out of here. - Terry, please... - No, me boss, you employee. Now close that door on yourway out to having a really nice day. [Door slams] - And then he says prove it. - So, did you? I mean, did you prove it? Why didn't you justshow him your notes? - He didn't wantnotes, April. He wanted a recording or aname of somebody that was there when the mayor said it. - So he thinks you're lying? - I don't know, all iknow is the mayor said it, and I printed it. - I just can't believe yougot thrown off the wilcox trial. You've been workingyour butt off on it. - I know, now he'sgot Mitch on it, Mitch! - You like Mitch. - I don't like himtaking my stories. - Story.- what? - You said stories, he'sjust writing this one. - For now, but I don't knowwhen this whole mayor thing is going to blow over. - So what is this fluffpiece about any ways? - I don't even know, ihaven't even looked at it. - Well, let's takea look see, okay? - Probably some dog showor canned food drive, or Fanny farkle that'scelebrating her 150th birthday. - Honey? - Was I right,is it a dog show? - Well, definitelynot a dog show. It's a press release. - A press release,what's it say? - It says union for civilacceptance announces town's first gay pride day. - What? they want me to cover astory on gay pride day? - Apparently so. Actually, no, they want youto cover the preparations of the gay pride day. - I get pulled off of amurder trial to do a story on gay pride day? - It seems to be the case. - It's killing me, April. - So what areyou going to do? - What am I going to do? I'm going to go intoterry's office tomorrow, and I'm going to tellhim I can't do this. - Tony, we can't affordfor you to get fired. - Look, honey, i'mtrying to get on with U.S.A. Today, all right? They don't hire peoplecovering fluff stories for the community section. - I know, but they alsodon't hire people who get fired for a scandalwith the mayor. - What am I supposed to do. - I don't know,i don't know. Tony, look, why don'twe just do the story? Do what terrytells you to do, and just get it over with. - But gay pride day? - Yes, a gay pride day. Have you got aproblem with that? - Look, Terry, I'm a seriousinvestigative reporter, all right? This isn't my kind of story. - It is now. - Please, Terry, just putme back on the wilcox trial, okay? Look, I know that they'redoing opening statements today, all right? And I got a lot of work to doif I'm going to get ready for it. - No, Mitch has a lotwork to do to get ready. You're off the wilcoxtrial, and you're on this. - So what do youwant me to do? Just write-up a littlearticle on this press release? - Not exactly.- Then what? - I want more ofa story than that. Get behind the scenes andfind out who the key people are. What are they doing toprepare for it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. - And you really thinkthat this is a story? - It better be with whenyou're done with it. - What if I tell you thati can't do it for moral reasons? - What are youtalking about? - Yeah, yeah, see,terry, I don't believe in homosexuality. In fact, I'm against it. As a Christian, ibelieve that it's wrong. - Okay. what does the Bible sayabout murder? - What? - Murder, what does thebible say about murder? - That it's wrong. - Yet you cover murderstories all the time. What's the biblesay about adultery? - Same thing. - Yet you called the mayorout on that, didn't you? Drove the point homepretty well as I remember. - Is there anything I cantell you to get out of this, Terry? - Yeah, "i quit"would do the trick. Otherwise, youbetter get going. You've got a luncheondate with the organizer. His name is Markus fry. Here's the address, he'sgoing to meet you there, big guy. I'm telling you, this is yourfirst step towards getting back on your feet.Don't waste it. - Sir?- hi. - Hello, what cani get for you today? - Can I get acoffee, please? - Coffee, wouldyou like that black? - Uh, yes, please. - Two dollars.- There you go. - Thank you. - Hi, how are you today?- Fantastic. - Would you like the usual?- Yes, absolutely. - Morning.- morning. - Do I know you?- I don't think so. - Yeah, I do. You're that reporterfrom the newspaper. Morris, Tony Morris,that's you, right? - In the flesh. - Well, it'snice to meet you. I read that story you didon the mayor, great stuff. - Thanks. - And you're also involvedin that wilcox trial, you're not here todo that, are you? - Oh, no, no, not exactly. Let's just say sometimes youdon't get to put your name on the hard-hittingstuff, you know? Sometimes you gottacover the fluff stories. - It sounds veryinteresting. - Someone's gotta do it. - So you're hereto do a fluff story? - Yeah, well,something like that. - Forgive me for something,but what is a fluff story? - You know, one of thosetype of stories that ends up lining the bottom of abird cage kind of thing. - I see. It seems a little beneathyou compare to the kind of stories you've been doing. - That's what itold my editor. Thank you. - Enjoy. - You know, actually,i didn't get your name. - Markus fry. - Um, Markus fry, the sameguy I'm interviewing today? - One and the same, man. - Great, yeah.- Shall we? - Please. - Look, about whati said, all right... - Don't worry about it. It's not exactly the footi wanted to start off on, but I'm sure it's ahurdle we can get over. - Well you know, yeah,it's nice to meet you. - I'm just really honoredand excited that the newspaper would comedown and cover our event. - Well, youknow, it is news. - As you said. You know, I really am a fan,and I thought the story you did on the mayorwas well written. And then I read theretraction this morning. - Oh, you read that? - Yeah, I'm a reader. So what happened there? - Um, you know what? Actually, why don't we focuson the event you got going on here? - Okay, right tobusiness, sure. - So tell me, what motivatedyou to make this gay pride day thing happen? - We wanted to create anevent that would create a sense of awarenessand unity among the l. G. B. T. Community and the communityas a whole, educate people, empower our peopleand liberate them. - Liberate your people? - I know how that mustsound, but you know, unfortunately, the gaycommunity is still oppressed. - Okay, do you feel thatsuch oppression is still prevalent herein our community? - Yeah, it's everywhere. I mean, people consider gaysand lesbians to be outside of the norm, and what theydon't consider normal, they consider wrong, evil... - Okay, Mr. fry,this is my fault. Why don't we get back tothe event at hand here? - Sure, sure. Call me Markus, though. - Yeah, Mr. fry worksbetter, more appropriate, so okay, so what kind ofreception has the event gotten from the community? - So far, it's positive. I mean, we had to go down tocity hall and fill out some forms, but there haven'tbeen any opposition, voices of oppositionor craziness. - Does that surprise you? - I think generally peoplejust don't want to rock the boat. They think we'llhave our event, and we'll just go away, butof course we're not going away. I actually am surprisedthere haven't been a few self-righteous bigots whovoice their displeasure. - So are you saying thereception has been good? - Absolutely. You're here, the televisionstation's doing an ad on us, and the mayor is comingout to give a speech. He's not coming out,don't print that. - Don't worryabout it, all right. Me and the mayor are notreally on the best of terms right now, so it's best notto add fuel to the fire. - Well, thank you. Hold on, I have to take this. - No problem. - Markus fry. No. Right now? Okay, I'll be there. Okay. Very sorry, I'm goingto have to head out. Is it possible we could pickthis up tomorrow and continue the interview? - Yeah, yeah, of course. Same time and place then? - Yes, perfect, thank you. I really, really am sorry. - He seems likea nice enough guy. He really believesin what he's doing. You've been awfullyquiet tonight, something on your mind? - Do you?- Do I what? - I mean, do you believein what he's doing? - Well, I'm not going to godown to the gay day parade, or whatever you call it,if that's what you mean. - That's not what I mean. - Then I don't knowwhat you mean, April. I'm just trying to do my joband write this story and be done with it so I can getback onto reporting real stories. Isn't that what yousaid to do last night? - I know, but then I got tothinking about it and got to praying, and what if godwants you to get through to him? - About what? - About what the biblesays on homosexuality. - I already tried thatwith Terry, all right? That didn't get me anywhere. - No, I'm nottalking about Terry. I'm talking about Mr. fry. - I'm not aiming to makewaves here, April, all right? I'll go in there tomorrow,and I'll have a cup of coffee with him, and then I'll writethe story, and that's it. Then I'm done withit, and it's over. - Isn't that what Mr. frybasically has been saying people have been doingto him all his life? Ignoring it andhoping it goes away. - What do you want me to do? You want me to go in thereand tell him that he's going to hell because he's gay? - That's not exactly thephraseology I had in mind. - He's not going to wantto hear that, all right? These people, they're likelong tailed cats in a room full of rocking chairs. They're just waiting forsomebody to get on their tail so they can hiss and claw. - So you're basicallytelling me that you'll allow somebody else to go in andtell him the truth so you don't have to riskgetting scratched? [Makes cat sound] - Honey, I got a job to doto support us, all right? And I'm walking on egg shellsright now at work already. At this point in time, icannot risk losing my job. I'm paid to get a storyand tell it, not preach. - I know a storythat you can tell. - I can't afford to losemy job, April, we can't. - I'm just saying thatsometimes god puts us into these difficult situationsand places, right? So he can test ourresolve and faith. - And what do youwant me to do, huh? I am this closeto losing my job. - I know. Maybe... Maybe just pray about it. Just pray about it. God will show you what to do. - I'm really sorryabout yesterday. Some things can't beavoided, you understand. - A lot betterthan you think. It's no problem. So first off, tell me, isthis gay pride day thing that you got going on here, isthis a way for you guys to say, look, here we are,and we're not going away. Is that it? - Yeah, thank you. In a way, I mean, it's a wayfor gays and lesbians to say, we're part of the community. We're your pharmacist,your doctor, your lawyer, your police officer,your teacher. It's a way for peopleto ask questions. Let them know that we arecontributing members of society. Get out of the little bubblethat they're living in and start recognizingus as citizens. - Okay, so are you sayingpeople need to change their minds about you? - Some people do, yeah. I mean, the worldhas changed, it's time everyonechanged with it. - Okay, why does theworld need to change? Was it really so bad before? - That sounds like somethingthe south said to the north before the endof the civil war. - All right, we'vedone it again, we've gotten off track here. So look, why don't you justprovide me with the name of the sponsors that you'veobtained for this event. - Tony, you seem alittle uncomfortable. Is everything all right? - Yeah, yeah, no,everything's fine, really. - Are you uncomfortablesitting across from a gay man? - Don't be ridiculous, no. - You are.- Mr. fry... - No, here's a man, here'sa reporter who's sat across, who's set next to, murderersand thieves and rapists and crooked politicians, andyet in this day and age, you're afraid to sitacross from a gay man? - I'm not afraidof anything. - Yeah, you are,and it's okay. You're not the first personto be uncomfortable sitting around me or being around meor dislike me, not like me, hate me, whatever. - Mr. fry, I don't know youwell enough to determine whether I like you or not. To be honest with you,it's not you I'm uncomfortable with. - What is it, then? - Well, it's your lifestyle. I gotta say, I'm notcomfortable with that. - You're not comfortablewith my lifestyle. - No, no, I'm not. - Should I make youcomfortable with my lifestyle? - I don't thinkthat you can. You know what? Actually, I think I gotplenty here to do the story... - No, no, no, I like this. You don't think that i'vegotten to my age without having to defend mylifestyle, do you? You tell me what you haveagainst my lifestyle. - I don't know. Iguess I just... All right. The Bible says... - The Bible says, huh? I've had this discussionmany times before, and I'm prepared tohave it again, are you? - Excuse me? - Are you prepared to havethis discussion with me? You seem like a smart man,and I'm fairly smart, too. Especially on a subject iam most passionate about, my life, that of myfriends and community. And I just want to make surethat you're up to having a discussion aboutthis subject. So let's make a deal. You come back here tomorrow,i'll come back here tomorrow. You tell me your side of thestory, I'll tell you my side, and then we'llsee where we are. - Okay, and Mr. fry,with all due respect, why on earth wouldi want to do that? - Well, you have the mayoron your back right now, right? I happen to be friendly withthe mayor and his family. You come back here, you tellme your side and I'll tell you mine, and then I'll getthe mayor off your back for you, and you can go back tohanging out with murderers and thieves and rapists, andyou won't have to spend any amount of timewith a gay man. - Mr. fry, I've alreadyexplained to you... - Cheap shot, I'm sorry. I'll be back here tomorrow,and I hope you will be, too. You have a goodday, Mr. Morris. - What have I gottenmyself into here? - You're really goingto go through with this? - How can I not? He can get the mayoroff of my back, and I can get back toreporting real stories. - Look at you,you're surrounded. Why so much homework? - What are youtalking about? - I mean, if you're justwant to go humor the guy, just say awaywants you to say, and that will just get himright off your back there. - He's too smart for meto fool him, all right? He'll call me not a technicalfoul and toss me out of the game. No, I gotta know whati'm talking about. - What's thebig deal anyway? I mean, I'm not gay, but ifhe's not hurting anybody, what do you care? - It's simple, Rick, okay? I don't think god wants usto ignore the situation, all right? He wants us tospread his word, even if that means goingagainst the grain a little, or in this case a lot. - What about your job, man? If this gets backto Terry, done for. I'm pretty sure the paper'snot going to put up with anymore of yourslip ups, man. - I've alreadythought of that. Sometimes other thingsare more important. Hey, babe, how was work? - Fine. hey, Rick. - Hey, April. - So what's going on? - Well, your lovely hubbyhere has a mountain of homework this he'sgot to attend to, so I'm going to getout of your hair. Just be careful, man. I mean it, just say whathe wants you to say, and get it done, thisis over your head. - I hear you. - What was thatall about? - Mr. fry has, howshould I say this? Challenged me to a debateon the biblical principles of homosexuality. - Wait, you meanyou took my advice? - Yeah, and I have no ideawhat you've gotten me into. - This is thebest opportunity. Tony, you get to tell himeverything that nobody's wanted to, but you knowwe never have the chance. This is so great,okay, all right, so just bury yourselfin here, okay? Just okay I corinthians, gothrough there and acts and all of this. Oh, my gosh, okay, you'regoing to figure this out. I'm so happy for you. - Could you do me a bigfavor, though, please? - What? - It's going tobe a long night, could you put onsome coffee for me? - Yeah, sure.- Thank you. - All right, if you needme, I'll be in the office. - Okay. - I'll make thecoffee, okay? - All right, babe. - Hey, honey.- Oh, hey, what time is it? - 7:30. I actually thought youleft for work. Did you sleep out here? - I think so. A littlebit, any ways. - I actually gottaleave for work now. Why don't you jump in theshower and get yourself all cleaned up. - All right, I will. - Do you feelready for today? - I don't know, babe. There's so much information. I don't know if ican remember it all. - I'm going to bepraying for you, okay? Just tell him everythingthat the Bible says. Tony? - Yeah. - God's going togive you the words. - Got it.- I love you. - Love you, too, babe. - I'll be praying for you. - Glad to seeyou could make it. - Mr. fry, let's getsomething clear, okay? I'm not a biblicalscholar by any means. I know what I believe. - I respect that. I also know what I believe,and that's what we're going to talk about today. - So, how do we getthis thing started? - Tony, first of all,this is not a fight. It's not about whothrows the first punch. It's a discussionbetween two people. - I hear you. - Okay, so what about this? Why don't you tell me whatthe Bible says about same sex attraction? - Okay, when the biblementions homosexuality, it's emphasis is on thebehavior, the lifestyle, and not the individual. God loves the sinner,but he condemns the sin. And my take on homosexualbehavior just like all sexual immorality isthat it's wrong. - Hold on, I didn't askabout your take on it. I want to know what thebible says about being gay. - Okay, but I thinkthe two go hand-in-hand. As a Christian,as a believer... - Okay, for the sake ofthis conversation again, let's just stick towhat the Bible says. - Okay, in leviticus it saysthou shalt not lie with can mankind as with woman kind. It is an abomination. - The old testament, yeah,i'm familiar with that. Are you familiar withthe writer Thomas Payne? - Yeah, he wrotecommon sense. - Good, he also wrotesomething called the age of reason. Do you know how he referredto the old testament? - No. - "Whenever we readof the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries,the torturous executions, the extreme vindictivenessof which half the Bible is written, it would be moreconsistent to call it the word of a demon thanthe word of god. It is a history of wickednessthat has served to condemn and brutalize humanity,and for my part, I sincerely detest it, asi detest anything that is cruel." End quote. I think that pretty muchsums up the old testament. - Mr. fry, I can't claimthat the old testament was written by pollyanna. I'm sure there are thingsabout the old testament we don't understand, and weprobably won't understand until we get to heaven. Like clues to a murdermystery or something that went undetected. - Don't you thinkthat the old testament, the Bible itself,is a bit antiquated? Doesn't it say in deuteronomythat when men fight with one another, and the wife of onedraws near to rescue her husband from the one who'sbeating him and reaches out to seize upon his privateparts that ye shall cut off her hand. Your eye shall have no pity. Now, that seems abit extreme to me. - Yeah, I wasn'taware of that passage. - That's my point. I think the Bible has to betaken with a grain of salt. How can something have beenwritten thousands of years ago apply to today? - Okay, but Solomon saidthat there's nothing new under the sun. Yeah, sure, we have newwidgets and gadgets and instant communication andentertainment on demand, et cetera, but man is facedat the basic core to live for himself or to livefor god, all right? People from our eraright now, yeah, sure, we can get into trouble a loteasier than somebody from the time of Moses because theiridols were clearly idols. Ours are justdisguised at hobbies, pastimes and careers. - Golden calves forthe 21st century. But doesn't, if iremember correctly, doesn't the old testamentendorse and actually condone child abuse? It says somewhere in there,do not withhold discipline from a child. If you beat him with arod, he will not die. If you beat him with a rod,you may save his soul. - It saysdiscipline, not abuse. - So you think hittinga child is discipline? - To some extent, yeah. Don't get me wrong, there'speople that go way too far, but I was raised in a homewhere if we stepped out of line, we got spankedwhere god put a little extra padding. - And you think that's okay? - It worked. I didn't getany into real trouble because I was scaredof punishment. - My parents neverlaid a hand on me, and I turned out fine. I've never committed a crime,i've never hurt anyone. - Okay, so whatabout you, Mr. fry? I mean, what is itexactly that you believe? - I believe that basically,everyone is free to make their own choices. I don't think that anyone cansay anyone is wrong because they make a different choice. Is a Chevy owner evil becausehe doesn't buy a Ford? It's like that Eric claptonsong, before you accuse me, take a look at yourself. I believe that people justlike to pick on other people because of their differentchoices and no matter what you do in life, somebody'sgoing to find something that's wrong with it. - So it's kind of look adouble-edged sword, then? - How do you mean? - Well, I mean you're darnedif you do and darned if you don't. If you as a member of the gaycommunity decide to mind your own business andnot speak out, then you'll be persecuted bythe radical militant gays. But if you speak out likeyou're doing here with your gay pride day, then others,the whatever you call them, then they'll be on your case. - Homophobes, yeah, butthere's a third group. Activists who leavethe quiet ones alone. If we have the same rightto choose between day and straight, don't we have theright to choose between being silent and beingvocal, as well? - Absolutely, and christiansshould have the freedom to speak out againstyour lifestyle. - I don't know about that. - Okay, so just forthe sake of argument, you're saying that if someonewere to hold a rally speaking out against homosexuality,you would argue their freedom to do so? - Of course. - So you havefreedom, but we don't? Doesn't that seemhypocritical to you? - We don't hold ralliesagainst heterosexuality and call it perverse. Our rallies are peaceful. They're for us as a communityto come together and support one another. - But what I'm hearing isthat the same rules don't seem to apply to you as forsomebody who's speak being out against your lifestyle. In other words, if somebodydoesn't see things the same way you do, they'repersecuting you. - It seems to me that peoplewho speak out against us are nothing more than prejudicedbigots, and Mr. Morris, I have to honestly tell you,i'm starting to think you might be one of those. - Whoa, hold on a secondhere, I don't hate anyone. Where do you guys come upwith that just because we tell you that your behavioris wrong that we hate you, huh? No, stop, let me finish. If I tell people that drinksoda that they're wrong because it containsharmful substances, does that mean I hatepeople who drink soda? - No. - Okay, and if I tell peoplewho drink alcohol and drive that that's wrong, doesthat mean I hate them? - Good point, touche. But there are peoplethat hate us, hate us. I have personally sufferedthe slings and arrows of outrageous fortunefor these haters. - Yes, but they can'tbe true christians. It says in the Bible thatif you hate your brother, then the truth is not in you. Only pseudo christians canhate you for being gay. I just wish that somehow youcould discern the difference between real hate andlove that gets misconstrued as hate. - Love that getsmisconstrued as hate? - Yeah, let's play the"what if" game here. If god warned you in thebible not to be involved in same sex activity,and you do any ways, and he banishes you tohell for all eternity, now that's astipulation, all right? - Yeah and thepunch line is what? - If I know thatyou're going to hell, and I don't tell you, then I,in fact, am showing hatred. But then there is theflip side of the coin. If I go out on a limb andrisk getting my head bitten off and getting accused ofhatred to tell you that you're wrong, that wouldrequire love on my behalf. - That would be a verystrange kind of love. - You wantedlogic, all right? I just dumped a bunchof it in front of you, and now you're ignoring it. - So you believe that allgays are going to hell? - I don't know. Luckily, I'm not thejudge of all mankind. Jesus is going to decideyour fate, not me. - You just said ifi believe in Jesus, that I get into heaven. Shouldn't that trumpwhether I'm gay or not. - No, see, I also said thatyou have to follow his rules. There's a bit ofcontroversy here. - Yeah, so I not onlyhave to come to Jesus, I have to giveup my lifestyle. I have to do both in order todance in the streets of gold, right? - Maybe I'm wrong,but I really think so. - But you have some doubts. - Okay, if you refuse togive up your lifestyle, I would say that you'replaying Russian roulette with your future. In this version, five ofthe six chambers would have bullets in them, andonly one would be empty. Do you feel lucky? - What about christianartists who have recently come out as being gay afterentertaining and inspiring other christians for decades,don't they still get into heaven for theirservice to god? - I told you I don'thave all the answers. I struggle with the samekinds of questions that you do right now, but okay,there's a passage in Matthew that says not everyonewho says, "lord, lord," will enter into thekingdom of heaven. Even some who have done greatthings in the name of Jesus Christ, who are guilty ofiniquity and lawlessness. I don't know exactly whatthat means, all right, I don't, but I don't wantto see anyone go to hell. I want to warn them, and iwant to give them a chance to repent. - Okay, you reallycare, don't you? I'm deeply touched. I've been attacked for mylifestyle in many different ways, but never with tears. - Well, they're alanguage, too, you know. - Okay, that's nice. But don't think I'm justgoing to be soft on you now. I'm still going to hold yourfeet to the fire on this. - I had a feelingyou'd do that. One more thing on hate. It seems that someday it'sgoing to be against the law to say thathomosexuality is a sin. The people who do,they'll be put in jail. That kind of thingmakes me weep, that people in America couldlose the very freedoms that thousands of peoplehave died to preserve, that good people will befaced with the choice of obeying god orobeying the law. - I'm just going to claim nocomment on that land mine, okay? We've covered alot of ground now. What's next? - I believe it's yourturn it broach a subject. - Okay, what about theholier than thou attitude that christians have. Basically that if youdon't agree with them, everything youbelieve in is wrong? - That's a valid question. Are gays assuming thatchristians who take a stand that homosexuality is a sinare automatically wrong because they believedifferently? - If we agree withthe christians, then we would both be wrong. - That's funny, butchristians get their opinions from the Bible. - So you're saying thateverything that you believe is accurate? Everything actually happened,flood, talking snake, all of it happened. - It was written by god. Sure, it's the word of god,it was written by men, but they were just vessels. They were just writing whatgod told them to write. If it came from god,who am I to doubt it? - What if the men who wroteall of those things so long ago, how do you know thatthey were actually writing what god wantedthem to write? - Faith I guess. I mean, we put our faith inthat, and we believe it. - Your faith, that'ssomething I have struggled with for a long time. What's the comfort inbelieving for the sake of believing? There are so many things inthis world that are right in front of us all thetime, right around us. Why not believein those things? - According to the Bible,faith is having the confidence in something thatyou haven't experienced with your senses yet. - Wouldn't thatbe blind faith? - Actually, it'sthe opposite. It's the act in believing insomething unseen that you do have a good reasonto believe in. Can you see bacteria orviruses with your senses, can you experience that? No, but you have faith in thescientists would have looked into microscopesand have seen them. Before microscopes, peopletheorized that bacteria and viruses existed because theysaw the signs of decay and sickness. They couldn't see bacteriabecause it's too small. Maybe we can't see godbecause he's too big, but he left behind the signsof his creation as a witness of himself. - I remember readingsomewhere once where Mark twain said, Andi quote, he said, "faith is believing thingsthat you know ain't true." That is why religion,christianity, can't be proven becauserationality takes us part of the way, and then we have totake a leap of faith to make it all the way across. - See, I don't think that'strue because the Bible says that faith is the substanceof things hoped for, the evidence ofthings unseen. - I know that the Bible iscontradictory in a lot of places. It seems to be this battlebetween faith and reason. - No, actually it saysin the Bible, let me see, it says we're supposed toreason so that we can attempt to show people that ourbelief is reasonable, justified andlogically defensible, so that the biblemakes sense. - Doesn't thatconflict with faith? - The Bible says that we'realso supposed to have faith. We're supposed to trust ingod and not lean on our own understanding. We're supposed to trust godwhether or not his word makes sense to us or not. - So with is it? Faith,reason, reason faith? What is it? - Well, when the two areboth understood by biblical standards, I don't thinkthere is a conflict. I think reason is just a toolthat god has given us to draw conclusions fromother information, like information thatcomes from the Bible. - And you believe thatfaith and reason actually work together? - Exactly, when we'retalking about biblical faith and biblical reasoning. See, I think faith is aprerequisite for reasoning. In order to have faith, wehave to believe that there are laws of logicthat are in place. - For me, I can't accountfor that kind of logic. It disagrees withlogic, my world view. - Okay so maybe you need totrade in your world view for a god world view. - Doesn't god wantus to be happy? I'm happy being whoi am, a gay man. Why should he care whoi share my love with? Why should hecare how I love, who I share my love with? - Now, don't confuselove and lust. It says in the Bible thatthe only way into heaven is through Jesus Christ,and believing in him and following his rules, andthat includes sexual purity. - I think it's yourturn to ask a question. - All right, um, when iwas getting ready for this interview, I was doinga lot of research. It seems to me that thesecelebrations are a way for your people toflaunt themselves. - Flaunt themselves? - Yeah, like guys wearingbikini briefs and high heels and wearing wigs. If you guys are wanting tobe respected and accepted, why would you try tostick out so much? - You think that all peoplethat are gay are like that? - That's the impression igot when I looked it up on line. - Have you ever actuallyknown anyone who's gay? - Yeah, actually I had acouple of friends in college that were gay. - And did they wearheels and wigs to class, little bikini briefs infront of the professor? - No. - Okay, then why wouldyou ask that question? - Okay, first off, I'm notsaying that all gay people are like that. I'm just saying if I was putin a position to celebrate my beliefs and my lifestyle,i wouldn't want to make a spectacle of myself andmaybe bug other people. - You mean you're not... You mean you're not going tohold a little Christian pride parade and wear wings andcarry harps down the street, right? - No, not any timesoon, all right. In fact, I think my halo'sat the dry cleaners. No, but seriously, ihave to ask you though, during this parade, isthere going to be those wild things or whatever youwant to call them, are they going to be aroundhere strutting their stuff for this gay pride parade? - Maybe, okay, but iwon't be one of them. - But do you think ourcity deserves that type of agitation and disrespect? I love my city here, and idon't want to see anything bad happen. - Me, too, ishare that love. Look, there are some in ourcommunity who like to express themselves. Some like to expressthemselves quite a bit, just like thechristian community. Look at that churchthat protests funerals and everything. Do you agree withwhat they do? - No, not at all, thosepeople are extremists. Jesus doesn't even condonethat kind of stuff. - They really believein what they're doing. - I can't justifywhat they do. - Then how can the entiregay and lesbian community be defined by a few extremists? You're trying to put us allin a little box and say that we're all the same. You can't do that, just as ican't say that all christians are the same apparently. So please don't classify meand my friends as being like what you've seen on line. - I assure you I'm notdoing that, all right, but I'm a reporter, andsometimes I have to ask questions to get tothe heart of the story. - Do you think it's possiblethat times have changed to the point where people justhave to accept that the culture has moved forward. Some people need to reallymove forward or be left behind. - No, because inthe eyes of god, we're still being heldto the same standards, regardless of what time orgeneration we're living in. - Are you so stubborn thatyou can't admit that people need to change theirthought process? - In the Bible, let megive you another one here, it says, "see to it that noone takes you captive through hollow and deceptivephilosophy which depends on human tradition and theelemental spiritual forces of this world rather thanon Christ." - How do you interpret that? - Don't go by what the worldsays instead of what god says. - What if the world,as most of it does, doesn't find anything wrongwith being gay and lesbian? What about that? - The Bible says it isn't. There's another factor wehaven't even considered here, a very big consideration. - What is that?- The devil. - You're trying to makeme laugh now, aren't you? - No, I assure you I'm not. Look, okay, why don't weplay another "what if" game? Let's say there's a mannamed John Doe, all right? And your job is to keep himfrom getting to Hollywood, California, thepromised land. You're invisible, you cantravel instantaneously, but you can't physicallymess with him. How would you keep johnfrom getting to Hollywood? - I'd whisper in John's earand tell him that Hollywood doesn't exist. - Okay, that's a good start,what else would you do? - I'd give him directionsthat led him to take a left turn at the black forestand end up in Albuquerque. - You're good atthis, okay, what else? - I'd convince him thathollywood wasn't such a great place to end up in. So I send him out west to endup with a fat lady in Kansas, getting involvedin drunken stupors, send him to a casino wherehe'd lose all of his money - that's great. - To be really cool, i'ddress up a town near a mountain with a fakehollywood sign and make him think he's arrived athollywood, he'd park his car. - Bingo, now you'vehit the guru stage. - Now, what would you do ifsomeone told John that you were doing this? - Convince him thatit didn't exist. It would be so easy tomess with people this way. It is so easy to messwith people this way. People are basically sheep. - Okay, now, comeback to real life. Jesus talks a lotabout the devil. Now, Jesus is the sonof god, as he said, and if that's true, then thedevil is just as real as Jesus, okay? Now if we take thatinto consideration, don't you think the devil'sbeen doing a number on you to keep you fromgetting to heaven? - You walked me into alittle Christian trap here, didn't you? Powerful logic if your"what if"'s are true. Your punch line is onlyvalid if the premises and assumptions thatyou've made are true. Show me god, showme he exists. - Only the holy spirit canshow you that god exists. Look, I urge you to blockthese methods of deception, these things, and see if youcan clear a path for the holy spirit. - So you believe it's yourjob to tell people what is right and what is wrong? - I believe everybodyalready knows what's right and wrong because god'sgiven us this guide, our conscience. The same laws he places inour heart are the same laws that are in the Bible. Every time we lie,cheat, steal, whatever, we're breaking god'slaw and we're sinning. And this little alarm isgoing on in our head saying, ding, ding, ding,hey, this is wrong. - What if my consciencedoesn't convict me for my sexual behavior. Could it mean thatit's okay for me, and it might bewrong for you? - No, because yourconscience can be disarmed. Persistent sin will do that. But we're all going tobe judged by the same standards. - My brain hurts, okay? We've covered a lotof ground today, and I've got otherthings to do, so why don't we trythis again tomorrow. - I'll be here. - Great, I'll see you then. Wait, I just want to tell youthat I really appreciate you getting real with me today,sharing your vulnerabilities, your doubts and your tears. - Well, maybe tomorrowyou can bare your soul. It's your turn tomorrow. You take care, Markus. - You too, Tony. - Oh... hey. It went that well, huh? [Tony moans] - Just look at itthis way, right? You just write the story,and then you turn it in, and then you'll never haveto worry about it again. - No, no, no,no, not exactly. - What?- he just wanted a recess. - A recess? - Yeah, I gottago back tomorrow. - Well, why? - I guess I stumped him. What am I doing, April? Besides beating myhead against a wall. - You know whatyou're doing? Exactly what godwants you to do. - Yeah, but why? - Because he told you. Tony, you could have gone inthere and wrote the story that you weresupposed to tell, but apparently god laidsomething else on your heart. Otherwise... - It must be that becausethe stuff I'm telling him is really deep. - What do you mean? - I mean I know a littlebit about the Bible. And you know I've been doingall of this homework to get ready for this, but the stuffi'm telling him is way over my head. I even had the guts tobring up Satan today. Yeah, I risked being laughedright out of the coffee shop, but it actually went well. I think I weakened hisdefenses a bit when he had to consider that he was beingled by Satan like a sheep on a leash to the slaughterand didn't even know it. - I'm so proud of you. - Did I some thinkingon the way home, too? - Yeah, what about? - I've been approachingmarkus like he was an enemy, somebody I had to joust with. But now I understand thatpassage that says we wrestle not with flesh and bloodbut with principalities. - Principalitiesand darkness. - Yeah, and Satan is thereal enemy here, not Markus. I'm not going to be able itdefeat Satan with logic. We need to liftmarkus up in prayer. - You're callinghim Markus now? - Well, he is a person,and he's a nice guy. - That's incredible. Tony, what do you think'sgoing to happen when this is all over? - I have no idea. - I mean, you don't thinkhe's going to come crying to you asking for forgivenessfor his since, do you? - No, not at all. He actually believes there'snothing wrong with what he's doing, and that'swhat worries me, that I'm going to talkuntil I'm blue in the face, - oh, he will. - He's got a thickshield, but I think I dented it today. - You know, if anythingyou're planting seeds. -I guess. I'll just go in thereand keep telling him what I can, maybe get him tothink about some things. - So what do you thinkyou're going to write when all ofthis is over? - I have no idea. Yeah, but I gottawrite something. - You know what? You'll figure it out. You always do. All right. - Thank you. - Can I make dinner? - Sure. I'm just goingto lay back here. [Music] * seems the world has closed its ears * to what god has to say ... * I believe we must take a stand for * what is right today ... * there's sin everywhere ... * so look the other way ... * but I choose to stand for Christ, * believe the words he says ... * the right to believe ... * the right to believe ... * it's a right to believe ... * it's a right to believe ... * the word of god stands as relevant today ... * but there are those who hide from truth of what * the good book says ... * they choose to live in shades of gray ... * instead of walking the narrow way ... * but I believe in standing for Christ... * whatever price we pay ... * the right to believe ... - This is unbelievable. I'm going to have thesethings all over the. [Music] - 1 corinthianschapter 1 verse 6. * right to believe ... * right to believe ... * it's our right to believe ... * it's our right to believe ... * it's our right to believe ... * it's our right to believe ... - Couldn't getour normal table? [Chuckling] - Yeah. um, hey, what's thatverse in the Bible, corinthians I think itis that talks about being gay? - I think you mean 1corinthians chapter 6. - Can you read thatone to me please? - Yeah, sure. It says do you not knowthat wrong doers will not inherit thekingdom of heaven? Done be deceived. Neither the sexuallyimmoral nor idolaters nor adulterers normen who have sex with men. - Yeah, that's the one. Now, that seems a bittough, doesn't it? - I guess, but it'sright here in black and white. - Seems interesting Tome some of the other words that are usedalongside that word you translate as being gay. Idolaters, the sexualimmoral and adulterers. Check it out. - Ok. what is this? - Surprise. - Where didyou get this? - As we've alreadyestablished, Mr. Morris, I also have friendsin high places. - This isnobody's business. - True, but it seemsto me that makes you a hypocrite. All this time you'vebeen saying my being gay is a sin against god andyet all this time I've been sitting acrossfrom an adulterer. That's what it says inthe divorce papers, right? Your wife caught new theact of having an affair. And isn't thatclassified right there alongside being gay? Being a drunkard? Being a thief? Adulterer. - You know what? You're right. You're right. I committed adultery. I cheated onmy first wife. I committed that sin. - Uh-huh. - And some day I am going tobe judged for that sin. I've accepted that isinned and I've taken responsibility for that,and I asked god for forgiveness andhe's forgiven me. - Well, you see,there you go. You and I aren'tso different. - If you mean becausewe're both sinners, yeah, you're right. I mean, yes,i'm a sinner. We're all sinners here. - Amen. - But there's one bigdifference between you and me. - What's that? - I know that icommitted a sin. I know it Andi admit it. I asked for forgivenessfor it, but I stopped doing it. - And that justmakes it all better? - I know Jesus hasforgiven me for those sins. - You don't say. - What about you? If you look in the bibleand god says that it's a sin to be involved inhomosexual activity, and you do end up standingbefore him being judged, what are yougoing to say? Are you going to sayyou're sorry for what you've done? - No. I am who I am. And I will never everapologize for that. - Wow. you know what? You are going tobe you're own prosecuting attorney. - I guess I'll crossthat bridge if I come to it. - When. - Excuse me? - You will cross thatbridge when you come to it. - You know, if there isa heaven and there is a judgment day, I thinki've got a better than average chanceof getting in. - On what basis? - On the fact thati've led a good life. I've never hurt anyone. I've neverkilled anyone. Out of the tencommandments, I've kept eight of ten of them, so likeyou I think I deserve to get into heaven. - Ok. first off, none of usdeserve to get into heaven. It's been made veryclear that actions and deeds alone willnot get you in. Only belief in jesuschrist and acceptance of him will get you in. - Obviously we seethings very differently. - Obviously. - You know, one of thethings I've noticed in the past few yearsis that churches are talking a lot lessabout gay issues. And why do youthink that is? - Ok. I feel like you'resetting me up for something here so i'mgoing to say, why do you think it is? - Well, I think thatthe church is start to go reconsiderits position. Last night I did alittle bit of research myself on the Internet. Did you know in 2003that the episcopal church ordained a gaybishop? And in 2004, the pacific northwestmethodist church supported alesbian pastor. If the Bible is soclearly against homosexuality, whyare so many churches supporting it? - Because I think thatin our society we've gotten to a point thatthe Bible is no longer seen as an absoluteauthority by all the churches. - Maybe that'sa good thing. Maybe the church isstarting to get some clarity. - See, I can't say thatthat's a good thing. As a Christian, I believethat the Bible is the word of god. Who are we, listen,who are we to pick and choose as his creationwhat we want to believe? No, I think the Bible isan all or nothing thing. Seriously, sin. You either got tobelieve all of it or you believe none of it. - God, you soundlike my dad. For real. I was raised catholic. I used to go tomass every Sunday. Catechism classevery Saturday. I really loved learningabout god in my classes. - So okay, ididn't know that. How did your parentsreact though when you told them you were gay? - How do you think? Not so well. My dad stilldoesn't talk to me. That's another problemi have with religion. Christianityin particular. If religion is all aboutlove and accepting people, then why is itso against what people do with their love? - I think christianityis not about religion. It's about arelationship. - What's thatsupposed to mean? - I think religion is man'sway to try to reach god. Instead offollowing god's law, they enacted their ownlaws that would suit their lifestyle orgive them control. - Right on. For the first time in threedays, I actually have to agree with you. True. - Okay. - I realized veryearly on that there was something differentabout me. And I also realized whatwas different about me was something that thechurch was not going to agree with. - That was going to bemy next question to you. How did you knowthat you were gay? - I guesswhen I was 18. I mean, I think iknew before then I was different. But it was only afterhigh school once I got out in the real worldand lived a little bit that I startedto realize it. - What was it thatconvinced you? - I saw thingsdifferently. I thought differently. I really wasn'tattracted to the girls I went to school with. At that point I wasn'tattracted to the men either. I mean, boys. I was more like a plant.Asexual. I started to read andmeet people, live life, and I realized maybei was born this way. Oh, let me guess, youdon't believe people can be born gay. - No, I don't. - You think all thescience doesn't -- - science? I don't thinkthere's ever been a gay gene identified by science. - You thinkit's a choice. - Yeah. - Medicalprofessionals, experts, the world over, thekinsey institute -- - Kinsey institute? Like Alfred Kinsey. Alfred kinseywas a homosexual. Seriously, he spokeout on restrictions for sex in any format. He was all for bestiality,incest and rape. I mean, thatdude was sick! And he unleashed with hisfaulty research one of the greatestrevolutions, a sexual revolution uponthe entire world. Do you realize that halfthe people he used for his research and surveyswere people in prisons and asylums? - No -- - hold on. Don't takemy word on it, okay? You do the research. - I have. - That man was puttyin Satan's hands. He's at least half toblame as Charles Darwin for the messed upstate of our society. - Darwin? really? You don't believe inevolution either. You think theworld is flat? - Don't even getme started on that. Let me ask youone question. One of the rules thatgoverns survival of the fittest is the abilityfor a species to pro create. The more offspring aspecie has the better chance of survival. How does homosexualityfit into that framework? How many offspring hasever been produced by same sex encounters? - A gay man canartificially inseminate and impregnatea lesbian woman. - Artificial. yeah. Isn't that the option ofnatural and thus a force that lies outside ofthe supposed process of evolution includingnatural selection. - So you think there'ssome biblical principle at work that made gaysand lesbians decide to swim up stream againsthumanity -- - it's wrong to say thatgod made me a homosexual because sin didn'toriginate with god. It originated with us. Man. [Deep breath] - You think there mightbe things in life, other factors as you saymight sway a kid? - Yeah. I've already mentionedto you the devil. And I really honestlybelieve that you're homosexual agendanowadays with your whole it's ok to be gay sloganis swaying kids to believethis they're gay. - You really thinkthat's the case? - Yeah, I do. - Don't you thinkthere's other things in this world that couldimpact a child, a kid? - Ok. define otherthings for me. - Like I said I used Togo to church regularly. At least until I was 14. - What happened? - I decided I didn'twant to go anymore. - Yeah. but I mean, why? - I don't thinkthat's relevant. - Of course it is. You were going tochurch all the time. Then you justup and stopped. I mean, something musthave changed your mind. - Are we off therecord here fully? Don't take any notes? - Yeah. of course. - When I was 14, I wasmolested by a man I went to church with, afriend of my dad's. I never told my parents. I never told anyoneuntil a few years ago when I toldmy therapist. - I --I'm so sorry.I --i had no idea. - Something changedin me after that. I felt like I wasworthless and broken. I kept asking myself howcould this Christian man --how could this godfearing man do this to me? How could god letsomething happen like this? How could god let thishappen especially to a little kid? - You blame godfor what happened? - I blame god fornot stopping it! I can't believe i'mtelling you this. - You --youdon't have to. - I think I gotta. I think I gotta let youknow that there are things that can happenin this world that can change a person forever. I came to peace withwhat happened a long time ago. I realized it wasn't myfault, but I could never understand how your godcould let that kind of evil live in this world. There, you see, yourdevil is really just a man. - He was just a toolin the hands of Satan. Just like god usespeople to build his kingdom, Satan usespeople to build his kingdom of darkness. [Chuckles] - That sounds like somekind of 80's horror flick. - Except it's real. Do you think that whathappened to you helped you make the decisionthat you were gay? - I think you'remissing the point. What happened to medidn't make me gay. I was born this way. What happened to me justmade me think the whole church thing was not allit's cracked up to be. Here was this goodchristian man, he did this to me. I was gay beforethis happened. Do you get it? I always felt that thechurch was a good thing. After that, iwasn't so sure. - There's nothing thati could say that can make you feel better. It's all aboutfree will. I mean, if god gave usthe ability to choose our own destiny, [sobbing] Evil had tobe an option. Ever since Adam took abite out of that apple in the garden of Eden,we were all cursed to live in a sinful world. - I know. You're a Goodman, Tony Morrison. [Deep breath] I hope you just knowthat people in the lgbt community are just likethe rest of the world. They just wantto be loved. We just want to be lovedand give love in return. - I know, just likesome extremists. Just like some peopleuse christianity to do the same. Satan is pulling thestrings of anyone he can, Markus. There are people outthere that can help you reverse this curse. - You're talking aboutdeprogrammers, pray away the gay. - I'm talking aboutpeople who set people free through god'sword and his love. There are peopleout there who --heterosexuals whostruggle with sex. And they put up thiswall between them and god. I did that myself once. I did. And I had to pray to godand ask him to help me tear down the wall. Research a man by thename of Dennis jernigan. He was a christianmusician. He is. But he was gay. Now he's the father ofnine beautiful children. - So you're sayingthere's somebody who can make me stop beinggay, make me "normal"? Who defineswhat normal is? - The Bible does. I mean, even if you lookat nature, even nature itself says that a malehooks up with a female to preserve lifewith the future. It's critical that youunderstand that it's not just homosexuals. Heterosexuals likemyself we deal heavily with sex. Porn and adultery arerunning rampant right now. And Satan, he's having afield day right now with the divorce rate,pulling and strings and everything with us. Another name I want todrop for you here, ok, it's Steve Gallagher. Check out his bookson sexual issues. He had them andhe overcame them. [Pen clicks] [Sniffs] - I'm rambling allover the place here. I think it's prettyclear that you can't prove god exists. - Maybe to you, but youcan't prove to anyone that god doesn't exist. - Let's assume thathe does exist, ok? My point is that youcan't show that being gay or lesbian is wrong. So far you've given mea few passages in the old testament. If you look in the tencommandments you don't find anything. New testament. Nothing. If Jesus made all therules, why didn't he say anything aboutbeing gay? - He did. - No, actuallyhe didn't. I've looked all over. Backwards and forwards,through the concordance. Nothing. nothing. - Here it is. First of all it says inromans, "because of this god gave them overto shameful lusts. Even their womenexchanged natural sexual relations forunnatural ones. In the name way that menalso abandoned natural relations with womenand were inflamed with lusted for one another. Men committed shamefulacts with other men and received in themselvesthe due penalty for their error." - Wait a minute. So -- - see. right there. Jesus did deal with gaymarriage in the new testament. - No. romans waswritten by Paul. Paul was not presentwith the disciples. He was not therewhen Jesus spoke. - You're right. Jesus didn't say thisdirectly, but what he did say god hand in handwith same sex marriage and homosexualityin general. Okay. In Matthew, he said, "haveyou not read that he who made them at thebeginning made them male and female, and said forthis reason a man shall leave his father andmother and be joined his wife and the two shallbecome one flesh." - This has nothingto do with what we're talking about. - Because Genesis isreal history that can be confirmed by science, hedid deal directly with the doctrine ofmarriage. - Science confirms Genesis? That's a big stretch. Come on. - Some scientists believe inthe big bang theory. You had nothingand then boom! Universe created. They even say that thatthe law of gravity if it were even slightlyhigher or lower that the universe would have beenstill born, it would have crushed itself. So where did the lawsof gravity originate? - I'm not anastrophysicist. - Check mate. God exists and heis the creator. All right. In John it says, "in thebeginning was the word and the word was withgod and the word was god." Now, we believe thatjesus the creator is the word. And so when Jesus isreferencing the old testament, he'sactually referencing its principles. God wrote the laws ofuniverse and society. - Tell me this, doesjesus expressly condemn in the Bible being gay? - Not in thosewords, no. - Thank you foradmitting that. Even if he did, thebible was written by men. Men can pick and choosewrite about and over thousands of yearsthings get translated aramaic to Greek, greekto Latin, english. How can somethingtranslated over that many thousands of yearsbe something you want to hang your hat on? An imperfectrepresentation at best. - Some words havemay changed through translation but theprinciples and teachings of the Bible arestill the same. The biblical view onhomosexuality has never changed. It's still the same. - But the civilizedworld has changed. The world viewhas changed. - Yes, but we're notsupposed to let the world views cloud whatthe Bible teaches us. - We're just goingaround and around in circles here. Maybe we just have toagree to disagree. - Markus, isn't thatwhat we've been doing for the past three days? It's like I saidyesterday, ok, I can't reason anyoneinto believing. - I have been tryingfor four years to get this city to give mea permit to hold our event, ourpeaceful event. Four years of no onelistening, four years of people mockingand judging. The idea of a gaypride day -- - four years? - Yeah. - Ok. well, look, christianshave been trying for over 2,000 years toget people to listen. They have been and stillare getting persecuted and mocked for whatthey believe in. I've been lucky. But there have been somany people who have sacrificed so that I canspeak openly like I am here today. - And that's what i'vebeen striving for, for the gay community, formy community for us to speak openly. But we have to dealwith people judging us. I've had to dealwith your judgment. - No. no, actually ihaven't judged you at all. I'm in no positionto judge you. - I think you came herealready having judged me, already havingjudged gay and lesbians. - Look, I've alwaystried to have an open mind. I usually don't get afeel for somebody until I actually get a chanceand sit down and talk with them. Some reporters they goin to write a story with a preconceived idea or apreconceived notion of who a person is beforethey even write the story. See, I pridemyself on not doing that. - Did you have apreconceived notion about me? - Honestly? no. No. To me this was justanother story that I was writing, Markus. - I don't get that. Based on the things i'vetold you the past few days, I would think thatyou would hate me by now. - There's something my mom usedto always tell me, okay. She used to saylove the sinner. Hate the sin. I don't hate you, Markus. I can't judge you forthe lifestyle that you live. All I can do is tellyou what I believe. - And you have theright to believe what believe whati want to believe. That doesn't make eitherone of us bad people. - No. what makes us bad peopleare-- at least in god's eyes is our sin. - Your adultery. - Yeah. andyou're homosexuality. We're both going to haveto answer for those some day. - Can I ask youone more thing? - Sure. - What are yougoing to write? You came here three days agoto write about my event, a gay pride day. All we've done thepast few days is talk about heaven and helland all these other stuff, so what are yougoing to write for the paper? - I guess I'll justwrite the story. - Which story? - The ones thatmy hands write. Unfortunately, Markus,that's the best I can give you right now. Can I ask you onemore question? - Yeah. - Are we good here withthe whole mayor thing? - Yeah, man. We're good. I'm a man of my word. I'll get the mayor offyour back like I said I would. He actually owesme a big favor. Well, I guess i'llbe heading out. It's been a pleasure. - You ain'tgoing anywhere. - Who? me? - Yeah. I want to show some ofyour gay pride here for us? - Wait a minute! What's going on? Do I know you? - No. but I know you and whatyou're trying to do. Not on my turf. - Hold ona minute, pal. Just put the gun downbefore somebody gets hurt and you regret thisfor the rest of your life. - You and I areon the same side. I've been listeningto your conversation. Get out of the way. - If that's true thenyou know that I believe in love and not hate. And certainlynot violence. Please, just putthe gun down. - Look, man, I don'twant to hurt you. Just that freak behindyou, so get out of the way or i'llhave no choice? Are you willing todie for this man? - Are you? I hear the electricchair is quite a shock. Greater love hath no manthan to lay down his life for a friend. - I'm warning you. If I'm going to fryfor killing one dude, doubling the scoreisn't going to matter. I only want to take himdown, so get out of the way! - Tony, you don'thave to do this. - Look man, you don'twant to kill anybody. If you did, youwould have done it as soon as you camethrough the door. You want to talk, solet's go outside and talk. - What do youknow about me? What I want is mybrother back, the one that got involved with asleaze like this guy and got aids and died. Can you bringhim back for me? - Look, I'm sorry aboutyour loss, all right, but this isn't going tobring your brother back and killing thisman won't either. Is this what you'rebrother would want? Think about that. Think aboutthat real hard. - You think I haven'tthought about this. What kind of fooldo you think I am? These people they're allthe same just like the one that got mybrother sick. - You think this iswhat your brother would want? He's gone. You're still here. All right. You think he would wantyou to throw away your life like this? What about your mom? What about your mother? Does she deserveto lose two sons? Think about it, man. - Tony -- - I think you justsaved my life. Why? - I don't know. Maybe after my heartgets below 5,000 beats a minute and my headclears up I can tell you. - After the adrenalinride subsides. - Exactly. whew. I've never been soscared in my life. - You didn't show it. - You didn't hearmy knees knocking? - I thoughtthose were mine. Did you really mean it? - What's that? - That you'Remy friend. - Yeah, Markus. You're my friend. - I don't knowwhat to say. I don't suppose you'daccept a hug from me. - Markus, even friendsneed to have boundaries. - It's ok. I understand. Thank you from thebottom of my rapidly beating heart. - I'm sure you wouldhave done the same for me. - I don't know. I hope so. - Markus, look if youremember anything about what we talked abouttoday, please please remember this, that eventhough we're sinners and we're broken, justlisten, god still loves us. He loves us more than wecould ever know and he loves us so much that hecame to earth to die for the very sinsthat he hates. All right? God bless you, Markus. - Excuse me, sir. - Yeah. - I just want tolet you know I called the police andreported that man. - Oh, thank you. That's good. - You're Tony morrisfrom the paper, right? - That's me. Yeah. - I couldn't helpoverhearing you talking to Markus and I apologize,but I have a couple questions. - Yeah, sure. Go ahead. - The things you weresaying about getting into heaven earlier, doyou have a pamphlet or anything onthat subject? - Oddly enoughi think I do. Let me see. There you go. - Thank you so much. - No problem. - And another thing. Do you think thatpeople really can help homosexuals change? - I don't thinkso, but god can. Thank you so much. God bless you. - Thank you. You too, sir. - And the festivitiesbegin at 11 A.M. Followed by a paradedown main street ending with a carnivaland a concert. Admissionto all is free. - Well, whatdid you think? - It is what it is. - It's a story aboutthe gay pride day. - Definitely is that. - Ok. what was isupposed to write? That was the story thatwas assigned to me. - I know but I'm sayingi don't know, after everything that happenedthese past three days I thought you would havewritten about that. - Terry wouldn'tbe happy. All right? I could lose my job. We could loseeverything. - I understand. I'm just saying thatthere's something bigger at work here and youshouldn't ignore it. - I'm not ignoringanything, all right? - Just --just promiseme you'll pray about it. - Ok. I promise. - I'm going Togo take a shower. [Lap top clicks closed] - Lord, god, I don'tknow what the deal was these last few days buti really need to know. This is the articlethat's getting turned in tomorrow. What am isupposed to do? What am isupposed to write? [Soft music plays] - Did you getit all done? - Yeah. at least until iget to the office. Right now, we need tohave a little talk. - That doesn'tsound good. Normally something thatstarts off with that sentence isfollowed by bad news. - Cool your jets. It's not aboutyou really. It's about me. I haven't beencompletely honest with you. - About what? - Adultery. - Tony, youcheated on me? - No, no. No, I haven'tcheated on you. I would nevercheat on you. I did on my first wife. And I never told you. - That scared me. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My bad. I was nervousabout telling you. I mean, I didn't want totell you but I felt that I had to. There's a wall, it's nota big wall but more like a curtain between us. And I don't want itthere any more and worry that one day you'd findout about it and you'd come to me and say hey,we need to have a little talk. - Why now? I mean, why are youtelling me now? - Markus. He found out and irealized if somebody could find out thatinformation, they could blackmail me with that. - My heart is stillup in my throat. I'm sorry. You didn't tell me wayback then because you thought I was goingjust to dump you? - If that would havehappened, that would have killed me. In one single act oflack of self-control and idiocy it would havedestroyed not only my current marriage butdestroyed my dream of a second chance witha wonderful woman. Penny for your thoughts? - You need morethan a pretty penny. Oh my gosh. My thoughts areall over the place. You just caughtme off guard. I guess, thank you. Thank you for beinghonest with me and trusting me. To be honest with you idon't know what I would have done in thebeginning of our relationship. I can't say what I wouldhave done six years ago. I might have givenyou the boot. - I understand. We've both grown upa lot in six years. - We have. Amen. And I really like whatwe've grown into. I can honestly say that i'ma happily married wife. - Ditto. - You're a happilymarried wife? - You know what I mean. - I just --i just needto get some closure on this. Can you just tell mewhat happened so I can try to avoid somethingsimilar happening? - I did a lot ofthinking about this, and I got marriedbefore I was 20. I wasn't even ready, Andi certainly had a incomplete understandingof what a covenant marriage was all about. - Now you do? - No, not complete. But muchbetter, I think. You know, I see moreeach day when I read the Bible. I see how god ismarried to his church. Do you understandwhat I mean? - Yeah, I knowwhat you mean. Covenant is a bigpart of the equation. It's a reallyimportant part. I don't understand howyou didn't get that. What caused youto break it? - I'm convinced it allstarted when my wife and I stopped prayingtogether. - Oh. a family that praystogether stays together. - Yeah. well, we stopped. As a result ourarguments snow balled out of control. Pretty soon it was likemy whole house was a war zone. The only time I couldeven bring myself to say I love you was in thethrows of passion. Totally unappreciated. And she complained abouteverything that I did. It might me feel theheight of a flea. And Lola came along. She had nothing but goodthings to say about me. She built me up insteadof tearing me down. - Was she prettierthan your wife? - No. she gave meencouragement and respect. - Men do craverespect, don't they? - I know I did. - And do you now? - No. I already have it. Or at least I didbefore this confession. - You still do. Thank you fortelling me. Why don't you --whydon't I stop crying. Come here. Give me a hug. [Door creaks closed] - Here you go. - I'm assuming thatthis is finally your story on gay pride day? - Yes, sir. - Why arethere two folders? Did you write two versionsand you wanted me to pick the one iliked the best? - Not exactly. There are two storiesthere but only one of them is what youasked me to write. The other oneis a bonus. One to be printed todayor at a later date maybe. - We can't print this. - Why not? That's just as much thestory as the gay pride day. - It's going to makesome people mad! - What do you think thearticle on gay pride is going to do? - Well, that'sdifferent? - In what way? Because the gay andlesbian community have a large backinglistened them? Or because it's a kick-a-Christian-to-the-curb decade? - Look, Tony, iunderstand your frustrations with this. I remember when I was inhigh school they showed us this movie calledfuture shock. It depicted a marriagebetween two men. My class mates and ijust laughed until the roof shook because itwas so ludicrous to contemplate two guyswalking down the aisle. - And now it's happening inseveral U.S. states. So you're not asupporter of their cause? - No. heaven's no. I don't even understandthe situation. Women are made like thisand men are made like --you know what I mean. You know, you can't puttwo bolts together and expect to holdanything up. - That's a good analogy. So it's kind of likeholding up an entire society through theatomic family structure. So you'll printmy story then? - Hold on! I'm nottaking sides here. This is a newspaper. Our goal is to makemoney, not take sides in a mini civil war. - Terry, you don't takesides by printing the arguments ofboth parties. If you don't print mysecond article, then you are taking sides andyou're muting information. The purpose ofnewspapers throughout all these years havebeen to inform and empower society to makeintelligent choices. Watchmen on the walls tomake sure that society and government arethe best they can be. - How about I give you newmurder story instead? - No. not instead. Also. Look, Terry, I wantmy story printed. Look, I'm guessingthere's no problem with the mayor'soffice anymore. - Yeah. mayor did call. - And? - You're off the hookon that, but if I print this you could beright back on it. - I'm willing totake that chance. Terry, this story isthat important to me. - Geez. ok. Ok. I will read it over inits entirety and I'll think about it. That's alli can promise. In the meantime here'syour new lead story. - I'm on it, chief! - Morning. - Morning. the newspaperis on the table. - Anything interestingin it today? - I thought so, buti'm biased because my husband wrote somethings in it. - Gay pride article? - Yeah and anotherstory as well. - What? you mean terryprinted my article? Oh, he never told me hewas going to print it. - He wanted tosurprise you. - That he did. Wow! Maybe he figured hecouldn't fire me so he'd cause me to have aheart attack instead. - Why don't youread it? - Sure? - Uh-huh. - When my editorassigned me the task of writing about thepreparations for the gay pride day to be held inour fair city, I was less than thrilledto say the least. Regardless, I met for threedays with the organizer of the event,mr. Markus frye. I was amazed by theenthusiasm and charm that he demonstrated. Like any other storyi've ever written, I did my best togather the facts. I soon realized howeverthat this story was different than anyof my previous work. For the first time in mylife I felt compelled to share something verypersonal and dear to me. Most of the time my jobjust requires me to gather facts andspit them out. I couldn't dothat this time. There was somethingbigger than myself driving me to injectmyself into the story although my journalistictraining screamed at me to back off. As I researched andwrote this first draft, I was finding that I hada story to tell about my journey to completethis assignment. This experience wasalmost like reading an interactive storyon a computer. I took a risk and toldmr. Frye that my beliefs as a Christian wereinterfering with my ability to write aboutthe preparations of the gay pride day. Mr. frye agreed todiscuss our differences with me in onopen forum. He did the best to sharewith me all the defenses that have been used tocondone homosexuality for years and I did mybest to show what the Bible and christianitysay about homosexuality. Mr. fry and he had haveheartfelt conversations that opened up newvistas to both of us. However my story was notabout a new vista but rather about refocusingon an old one. In the clamor of thehomosexual community to show their pride, idiscovered that I need today come out ofthe closet myself. I'm not ashamed of thegospel of Jesus Christ and I needed to show mypride in my creator. I realized that we as asociety have decide that had being politicallycorrect is more important thanobeying god's laws. The laws of mankind havesomehow soup seeded god's laws. I realize we needed tochange this if we want or country torise again. I think we need to getback to using the Bible as a moral compassand not using the GPS of corrupt andcorruptible men. The practice oftolerating everything even when you knowsomething is wrong just to avoid conflict isn'talways the best way of handling issues. I've been doing that,but now I draw a line in the sandand say no more. I have to wonder whymy feelings are no longer respected. Is the vocal minorityin our world now controlling the silentmajority through intimidation andlobbying and pressure? I fear we havesacrificed the very principles that our fourfathers have founded our country on. We've taken sacredprinciples of democracy and freedom anddistorted them so that the freedom of religionthis nation was founded upon can be retired, tobe replaced with the repress significantsystems of the past who anyone who differed withthe ruling party and religion or politicswas in danger of having their necks stretched. We used that policyto remove prayer from schools and then refusedto examine the evidence of how our society hasdecayed as a result. Can we honestly say thatour country is better because ofthese changes? I wondered why got putme into a position to talk to somebody thatwas never going to change his positionon something. Then after all theconversations were over and I was about to exit,i young lady came up to me and asked to knowmore about my faith. I realized then that iwasn't wasting my time for those three days. My words, the words thatgod gave me touched someone that I didn'teven know was listening. This may very well thelast article I ever write for this paper. Maybe any paper. But I can truly say ifi had to do it all over again, I would. The homosexual communityshould be allowed to express their opinions,but in a truly free society christiansshould be allowed to keep their rights toexpress opinions that they glean from theiruse of the bedrock of American society,the Bible. I am a Christian, abeliever in Jesus Christ and the word of god. It is my god given rightto believe and to think and to worship inany manner that my conscience dictates. I choose to exercisethat right to believe. [Music]
