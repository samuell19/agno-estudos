Miss angel? Camp's packed up and ready to hit the trail. We should reach the outpost by dusk, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Foliet. I've traveled hundreds of miles from my home to a place some has referred to as hell. A beautiful hell, if you will. And tucked away into this corner of the world that few have ever been is a world that might only be fit for the devil himself. This is a land full of violence where outlaws, pistoleers, deserters and murderers have been calling home for the past few years. But now that the great war has ended, the east has vowed to end terror and lawlessness across the land. And so the capture and the execution of evil men begins as bounty hunters, scalpers and even the army move in to exact their view of law and order upon these expansive yet bloody lands. We close? The outpost is just right up ahead. All right. Man's idea of civilization has arrived. Arizona is what they call it. - Thank you. - Yeah, of course. All right. Captain's up ahead here. - Captain. - More lambs to the slaughter? This here is Annabelle angel. I know who she is, ebb. You arrived a bit earlier than we originally expected. Apologies, sir, but I had a wonderful guide. I do hope I'm not intruding. Intruding? No. But I have a question to ask, miss angel. Do thoughts of death visit you often, or are you just simple minded? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Simple minded would be the answer, then. The reason I ask is because no respectable woman in her right mind ventures to these parts. In fact, the only women who ever come around here are looking to spread their legs for a few pennies. You understand my meaning now? I do, and my response is quite simple, indeed. You are here to do a job, if I'm not mistaken? Get to the point. I am as well, sir. It's the job that's made me travel all these miles. Writing an article for... what is it? - The San Francisco examiner. - Right. And this stupid article is worth possibly being raped and murdered, shot, out, or othennise maimed in this godforsaken desert? And this article, it's gonna be on the men we're chasing down out here, and the good job that my men are doing? - Yes. Well, I don't have time to dig deeper into your logic, miss angel, but please know that I cannot afford any type of protection for you while you're here, so you'll be on your own. I understand. And if any harm should come to you while you're here, it will not be the fault of the United States army, and I better not read that in any newspaper. The responsibility of some crazy woman that wants to immortalize herself in print will not be on my head. I'm not trying to immortalize myself. Sir. Pardon? You say "sir" when you address me. I've earned it. Ebb, show her the lay of the land. You write your article true, miss angel. You write about the cutthroats and savages that we're trying to exterminate from this land. Well, sir, I guarantee you that's exactly what I'll be doing. Then I expect to see you soon, I should think. - Sir. - Ebb. Crazy woman. Well, I'm sure that could've gone a bit better. Is he always that inviting? Miss angel, listen here now. Hensley ain't one to go crossing around here. He's the whole show. He's just as dangerous as any Joe, John and Harry out here, if not more so. The man has eyes and ears all over. So walk lightly in his presence if you want to avoid trouble. Are those words sticking with you, miss angel? Right then. We should go get you outfitted. Get you a place to stay. Hell, we leave now, we can get to the junction by nightfall. What's junction? Just the place you wanted to write about. See, those of us who call this place home refer to it as a neutral patch of land, if you will. Now, come on. Howdy. Well, this here's the only supply stop. There's nothing north of us but injun territory. Now, most people around here call this place home. Mostly because everywhere else there's a price on their head. Well, right over there, that's a saloon. Or what we call one, anyway. It's a rough place. You want some answers or to find someone, that'd be your best bet. Right next to it is churtle b's bathhouse. Nice hot mineral water comes straight from the hot Springs. Also plays home to most of the whores in town. Right around, trading post. Lanterns, wood, sheets, you name it. Man who runs it, his name is Deacon sparry. Been here since the camp's inception. Also one you might want to talk to. Now... There's one thing to remember here, miss angel, is that this place don't quite like the army much. They make a lot of coin off them soldiers. Interesting sight, seeing some of these boys in blue wandering around with the likes of men you see here. Were it anywhere else, would be at the other end of a rope. But they can't touch them here in the junction. You mean this place is considered a safe haven for criminals, Mr. Foliet? Well, miss angel, you catch on quick. Why hasn't the army raided it? Listening to captain hensley back there, you'd think this place would be in ashes. The army needs this place just as much as everyone else does. It's an interesting arrangement. Which is why anywhere else outside this place is dangerous. Army's been putting bounties out, attracting folk from all over the country. They show up looking to shoot the man whose face is printed on that piece of paper. And the others? Ha! They're looking to shoot the new faces that show up, 'cause they figure they're only here for one reason... those bounties. Sounds like a very violent type of life. Yup, yup. No truer statement's ever been made, ma'am. Right over there, that's your lodging. Go on in and talk to vern. He's got a room arranged for your stay. I suggest you get your essentials in the morning, seeing it's getting to be dark now and, uh, well... This town can get a bit rowdy at night. You be real careful now, miss angel. I'd hate to see anything happen to you. Oh, no. All right. Thank you. - Good night, ma'am. Night. - Good night. That's it now. Who do you want? What you got in there? You got going... Jericho Ford. I don't think we'd had the pleasure of meeting, good sir. All right, gentlemen. Looks like we're in time for a tussle. Who's taking bets? We got corn and Jericho. Who's got what? What do you got? Oh, more to Jericho. Who do you want? You got gorn? Right. Speak up, kid. I think you're going for corn. I believe you want gorn. You, sir, are an idiot going for Jericho. You want gorn or Jericho? We got one for corn and Jericho. How about you pour me a little shot there, baby? One for Jericho. That's a bad bet, son. What do you got? All right. All right, gentlemen, good luck. You know I'm good for it. What are you looking at me for? Darn. Come on, Jericho. I've heard a lot about you. I'm gonna enjoy this. Come on now, gorn! Come on, Jericho. All hot air. No brass balls. Come on, Jericho! Get him! Come on! Take him down! That's it! Come on! Not a bad little tight. Looks like we got ourselves a round two! Thanks for that. Well, that could've been a bit more graceful. Graceful? I'm trying not to get my head knocked off in there. You know, big things fall hard, Jericho. Didn't know you were in for dinner and a show. All right. All right, here we go. Round two. Let's go! That's what I'm talking about. Finish him off! Get in there, gorn! Oh! Whoo! Get up there! Come on, get up! Ain't no one ring the bell yet? Come on! Use your head! - Come on! - What are you doing? Ante's on you, Jericho! Oh! He's on the ground! Finish him off! Don't let him get up! Come on! Oh! I felt that. Come on! Get up now! Come on! Well... That is, as they say, that. You gonna be at the longfellow? - I'll see you. - All right, good. You best be careful around here, lady. You might make a man awful nervous, following him around like you're doing. She ain't following you, Ford. Don't flatter yourself. She got better taste in men than that. I do. I mean, I don't... I mean, I wasn't... Wait, let me get my words about me. I wasn't following you. I just heard the commotion outside. Hey. How'd we do? - Good, boss. Better than most nights. - Yeah? - And it's all here? - No skimming. - No, sir. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to find us a couple of bruisers for next week. - All right? Keep it coming. - Yes, sir. And here, put this in the till. - Yes, sir. - No skimming. You did good, Ford. I ought to give you more free booze. Now, don't let Jericho here fool you. He's just spent a little too much time in the sand with the snakes, and he's forgotten how to treat a respectable woman. - Says who? - Says me. Now, um... I don't seem to remember you around, and I know pretty much every face in town. Yours is not a face I'd forget. My name's Annabelle angel, sir. - Ah. The reporter lady. - That's correct. Mm-hmm. Yeah, ebb told me about you. Said, uh... He says some fair-haired, light-skinned woman might come in here with a set of legs and ask for stories. Is that what you're doing? Looking for stories? What can I get you? - You want some water or tea or milk? - Whiskey. Whiskey it is. Forgive me if I am mistaken, but you're who this establishment belongs? Well, that's an interesting way to put it, but... I am who this establishment belongs. Yes, ma'am. The name's Albert longfellow. This is indeed my spot, and you can call me al. Please, Mr. Longfellow, join me for another. Certainly. Yes, ma'am. - So how long you been here? - Oh, since the beginning. Since the beginning. The beginning of time. Since Eve gave Adam the apple. You know, it wasn't long after that that the army moved in, and then they started poking their nose around these parts. You're a reporter lady. You might maybe look into that. Cheers. Well, what are we cheersin'? To you being my first friend in this place. Annabelle angel. - Is that a pseudonym? - No. So, what kind of paper would bring you around here, check out us forgotten souls here in the most desolate part of the new United States of America? - San Francisco examiner. - Oh. George hearst's publication? You know your press. They sent a lady reporter? They actually weren't going to send anybody. I volunteered. That's the fifth hand in a row, pike. Ain't nobody that goddamn lucky. No need for all the commotion, boys. Everybody here, just let's have an honest game and a nice stiff drink. I'm sure ai would appreciate it if you took this outside before it escalates any further. Fewer words, buck. What are you implying? I'm calling you a two-bit hack of a gambler who cheats at cards. Now, then... What do you suggest we do? I assume you have some sort of plan, being that you're calling me a cheat. Or am I wrong, and you are just a man with loose lips who cannot hold their liquor? You are really a scurvy bastard, ain't you, pike? What kind of a name is Oslo pike anyway? Jesus. Al! I don't believe this is any of your concern, woman. Hey! Y'all know the rules, boys. That sign ain't up there for decoration. Well, would you like me to walk him all the way to the river before I shoot him there? Would that make it so your night is no more interrupted, Christine? You ain't shooting nobody. "Dost thy ferryman seal our souls to heaven or hell?" Asked the reaper. "To hell," responds god. And hell was filled with a thousand screaming voices. You're quite the poet. I think you've done enough here tonight. You can just take your money and go. Now, you saw that. They drew first. I'd consider that justified. Wouldn't you, ai? For the mess. Hello, Ford. Heard you were scrapping outside. How'd that turn out for you? Well, I'm still here, ain't I? No bite marks or bullet holes. Yeah. Yet. Well, uh... What are you carrying there? Oh, I got $5 says I could put all six rounds in you before you can even pull that out of your holster. Want to make a wager? Gee, that sounds like an awfully good time, but, uh, I'm gonna have to decline your generous offer. Too much of a yellow belly, huh? You know, I'd call it... Smart, tired and drunk. And I can only assume that you'd want me at my best, pike. Or would I be mistaken? All right. You've had your pound of flesh for the night, Oslo. And my hospitality for you has run out for the night, so... Why don't you go slither away? You're the boss, al. Be seeing you, Ford. Sometimes you need two shotguns. Well, well, well. What we got here, boy? Good morning. And good morning to you too. What's a pretty little thing like you doing all the way out here by yourself, miss...? Angel. Annabelle angel. I was just taking a walk, is all. Trying to find the river, actually. Is that so? Angel? That's a last name, ain't it? Well, the riverbed's just over yonder there. Kind of dry this time of season, though. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'll be on my way. What's you in such a hurry for? I'm writing this story for the newspaper. Story? On how well the army's doing to keep this place safe. We are doing a good job, ain't we, boys? - We are. - For sure. You know, it's nice to be rewarded every once in a while. You know, for providing our services. Wouldn't you agree? I'm sure you could find plenty of reward in this place you call a town. Gets a little boring seeing the same faces... Over and over and over again. You know, I asked the good lord... I did, I asked him if he would send me a real little angel, just like you. Fair to say you think my prayers have been answered? Come on over here, darling. Come here. It's all right, darling. Lower that damn gun and we'll be gentle with you now. Get back! Get back! Get back, I said. Look at you. By the looks of it, you trembling with that gun. You ain't never shot a gun a day in your life. Ain't that right? Oh, Jesus! She shot me in the ear! Does anybody else not want to listen to a lady? Whichever way this ends, you die today. Are you boys lost? Can't you tell you interrupting something here, mister? Mr. Ford, thank god. Stay back. Drop the gun. I'm gonna take the girl and we're gonna be on our way. Go on, keep moving. I got a tickle telling me I'm gonna smoke your friend here. And I'm gonna take your ear with me. Look, there's no need for violence here. Let the lady go and we'll all be the better for it. You ain't in no position to be giving me orders. It wasn't an order. It was a suggestion. Well, what's the damn difference, then? Well, if it was an order, it would sound like this. Let the girl go and you can walk out of here alive. You're him. He's on the captain's wall. Well, then what the hell are y'all waiting for? Stay there. Stay there. Stay back, goddamn it. I'll cut her from one ear to the other. I swear, I will. Then I'm gonna ask you again. Please, let the nice woman go. If I let her go, you're gonna kill me. And if you's really on the captain's wall, that makes you a murderer, you no-good... Mr. Ford. Oh, the wanderer awakes. You are safe here. No harm will come to you. Good thing we came along when we did. The white soldiers care not for anything here. You were the one firing at the soldiers. Thank you. Thanks are no good here. Anybody who values life and has compassion would've done the same thing. I'm not sure I believe that. Why does a white woman walk alone in a place such as this? Well, I was looking for the river. The river runs dry. So I was told. Where is Mr. Ford? He's outside indulging himself in some firewater. Morning. What the hell are you still doing here? Thought you'd be on your way back to the junction by now. This ain't no place for you out here, lady. Well, I do want to say thank you. What? You both live here? Yes, this white buffalo and I share company together when he's not living in the bottom of a bottle. Who are you calling a white buffalo? Well, now that you've met wasco here and he's seen you to wake, you can be on your way now, leave us to our rather simple life. Hosting company is not a strength of yours. Well, I like my peace and quiet. Mr. Ford, if it's okay, I'd love to ask you a few questions. For what? Oh, that fancy article you're writing, huh? The one where you paint us out to be all murderous thieves living in caves, slaughtering women and children? That's a lot of assumptions as to what I might write. I've seen quite the opposite, have I not? He will answer questions. I swear, if we weren't friends... Then you'd have been dead a long time ago. Come, sit by the fire. Warm we must keep, for the snow will be here soon. Fire, fire, fire. Fire makes the world go around. White man made fire, you know. He did not. Captain? What is it? We, uh... Spit it out. What happened, private? We was ambushed, sir. Ambushed? Ambushed by who? Speak, son, and be detailed. We was escorting that reporter lady through the junction, down by the barn... And a man jumped us. And how many of you were there? Three, sir. So one man took on three military-trained individuals and came out the Victor? No, sir. I'm certain that he had help. Rifle fire came from somewhere else. So two men did this, then? That'd be my guess, sir. Well, what about the girl? They, uh... They absconded with her, sir. Stay away from big words, private. They don't agree with you. Did you get a look at these men? I got a real good up-close look at one, sir. And what did he look like? It was him. This man? Muster an escort for me. I'm going to apache junction. - Sir. - What is it? He killed your boy, sir. John's dead? Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Boy never was too bright anyway. Go on. But he was a soldier. And justice will roll like a river, righteousness like a never-ending stream. How'd you both find this place? How'd you come to meet? One question at a time, lady. I was born here, me and my people. And where are they now? I came out from the plains. Drove cattle out there for a while until the war hit. And then? You're just a mighty bit nosy, ain't you? That's my job. Well, I'd be looking for a more respectable occupation, if you ask me. Says the outlaw. Who said I'm a wanted man? Alas, what would a respectable occupation be for me anyways, Mr. Ford? Gander a guess that you come here because you've done something awful bad. Unlike your compatriot wasco, who was born in this land, you had to migrate here. And from my understanding, the men that learned to call this place home are... Murderers and thieves. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like I said, lady, you is nosy, and exactly why no one respects a person of your occupation. Jericho came out west because he did not want to fight the great war. So you left before it started? Well, it didn't make sense to go fighting other people's battles. The white man's drink does funny things to the mind. All right, that's enough. No, it's important that she knows how this relationship was forged. Jericho took a bad fall hunting one day. Me and my people took him in, saw that he was healed. The army offered a reward for any Indian brought in, dead or alive. You know, I know I got a bottle around here somewhere. Army men arrived one day. Began to do what they do best. I know I have a bottle around here somewhere. Murder. Jericho decided to respond back with lead. And that was the end of the story. These lands have seen enough bloodshed to last a lifetime, miss Annabelle. It's never in our best interest to spill more. We all have a history that brought us here. But like my people before, we've all been written to be the devil in a land that's not theirs to give. Well... Would appear to be quite the party, then. Mary, what the hell are you doing out here all by yourself? I am a grown woman. I think I can handle myself. Oh, yeah, that's what this one thought earlier today, till hensley's troops tried to raise her skirt. Are you okay, darling? They didn't hurt you, did they? No, they didn't... Thanks to Mr. Ford and Mr. Wasco here. What happened? Well, I might've had to shoot one of them. Three? Yeah, that does sound more accurate. Those military boys will be up in arms, Jericho. You know it as well as anyone. I'm afraid we haven't had the chance to meet yet. Yeah, this here is the newspaper lady. Annabelle angel. Mary... primm. I brought some fresh vegetables... And something to drink. Mwah! Sweet Jesus. What about you, Annabelle? - What you like? - Some bread, please. - I got you covered. - Thank you. It's horrible, you know? All those women and children, just defenseless, slaughtered in the middle of the night. No badge could help that. They'd have needed their own army. I guess you can't change the past, now can you? Evening, ai. Captain. What the hell did we do for him to grace us with his presence? Should I fetch the scattergun, miss Williams? No, al's got it behind the bar. Just go about your business. Place looks good. Business looks better. What the hell are you doing here? Is that any way to greet an old friend? We got rules. You're breaking them. Oh, yeah. We don't come looking for wanted men here at the junction, and our outpost continues to receive goods and services. An honorable agreement, yet beyond counterproductive to my work, ai. It's kept you fed. Kept you clothed. You here to balk at that agreement? Miss Williams, the mouth that never closes. Don't you have a brothel to run? You don't have a dog in this fight. Well, it's worked so far, so I'm gonna ask you one more time. What are you doing here? Well, it appears, and, of course, I'm just guessing here, that one of your customers dispatched some of my soldiers this morning. Well, that's unfortunate. However, it did not happen within the confines of my walls, so it doesn't make it my problem, does it? So I'm guessing it's out of the question to ask you if you've seen this man. - Out of the question. - Out of the question. Christine... let me to my business. Al, if I wanted to, I could gather all the men at my disposal and march them in this shitty little town of yours and burn it to the ground. Meat and grain and women, all those things are replaceable. So all these many years that I've let you keep these walls standing and keep me from the one step that I need to make to completely obliterate the lawlessness in this territory, I'm asking you to do one thing for me now. You tell me the next time you see this man. And for the rest of you... I know there's many men in here that I'd love to show the noose and see them ride the pine straight to the devil. But I lost soldiers today. And an innocent civilian in the form of that reporter from San Francisco got kidnapped. So I'm offering a bonus of up to $200 for the man or men that bring me Jericho Ford. I want him dead or alive. Dead would be preferable. What about that girl you were talking about? Extra $50 if you find her. If not, I'll consider her a casualty of war. It's been fun, al. I know I'll be hearing from you very soon. Let's go. No way Ford done what he said, ai. He's not that kind of man. You know it, I know it. Yeah? Are you sure about that, Christine? With all the trash and hooligans running around this town? I know a good man when I see him. You certainly do. I'll tell you what's more important thaninnocence. Survival. - Hmm. - The way I look at it, we got a lot more outlaws than army boys around these parts. So if you're starting to think that you might want to turn Ford in, well... You don't think these hooligans might start thinking the honorable ai longfellow might do the same thing to them if the opportunity presented itself? If it was me, I'd start sleeping with one eye open and my hand clutched around my pistol, if I was gonna head down that road. - You're a smart woman. - Hmm. That I am. Thank you. It's different, right? What's that? It's different from what you thought you'd find here? I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Society has this place pegged as a ruthless land full of criminals. And captain hensley and his agenda clearing out the rabble to make way for a "proper" civilization. At least, I am assuming that is how the rest of our newfound United States views our little corner of the world that we've carved out for ourselves. They never had a chance to think any different. You can be that chance. There are people here that are just trying to live their lives. They like having a small piece of earth... Where they aren't judged every day. We all may be misfits, but it helps it go down a bit smoother, you know, when society ain't inflicting its view of law and order upon us. What about the ones that actually have done the unspeakable in their past? How does one justify the continued freedom to the loved ones who have had someone or something taken from them? Honey... I have learned that bad people get what they deserve in some form or another. Whether that be now or ten years from now, the lord and the devil alike see that justice be done. You can't let bad people go unpunished. There has to be some sort of law and order, Mary. Yeah, I suppose there does. Don't let the view fool you. This place has its disadvantages. Like what, exactly? Look at me, Annabelle. I'm a whore. As long as I stay here, I'll always be a whore. But that's your decision, is it not? There's nothing else here. Not for women. I'm not sure I believe that to be true. You've seen it. The looks you get. No one can believe someone like you is here. They haven't seen a woman with freedom of expression. You could leave. Not without him. You love him? I think I do. I'm gonna put that in my story. - What's that? - That this place isn't lost. That there's warmth here. Kindness and love exist. - Have you told him yet? - No. Why not? A man like Jericho Ford doesn't want to spend the rest of his life with a whore. Well, my observations tell quite a different story, Mary. I'll be back tomorrow. Don't burn the camp down while I'm away. Stay away from the drink, my friend. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay. Goodbye, Mary. Oh, I'm sure I'll be seeing you soon enough, Annabelle. I'm gonna walk miss primm back to her residence. If you like, you're welcome to follow me back when I leave. What? Wasco likes the company, is all. She's educated. He likes that sort of thing. Gives him someone to talk to. I would love to, Mr. Ford. I'll just grab a couple things from my room. Yeah, take your time. I got to go to al's and get me a bottle or two. Go to the store. Wasco needs spices. Since when did you get a heart? Woman, I've always had one. It's been sitting right here, beating away each and every day. - Is that so? - That's a fact. You're a good man, Jericho Ford. I'm a lucky girl to have someone like you in my life. No, you ain't, Mary. I... I should be doing a hell of a lot better by you, Mary. Someday. Someday, we'll leave this place. We'll leave this place, and all the baggage that comes with it. I guess we all got to stop running sometime, right? The blood-soaked lawless sands of Arizona are not what they would appear. I have found the beginnings of friendship in a few of the residents here. Upper-class society will condemn them as criminals, traitors, savages, even. But I have now witnessed the blossoming buds of love and hope in a place that before I never would've thought possible. This place still has many faces that it has not yet shown, but if the hospitality I have received so far is any indication of this place and its people, it is not what the modern world would have everyone believe. The only real monsters I have encountered were the ones that were put here to protect people like me. Irony weaves a winding road. It's a little empty in here, ain't it? We closed today. Five years I've been coming to this joint, and I never seen you close. The captain came and paid us a visit. He said you shot some of his boys... And you kidnapped that reporter lady. Yeah, those boys were gonna rape her. But she's here right now in her hotel room. By her own free will. If I don't do something, they're gonna burn it all down, Ford. I known you a long time, friend. And I said to myself, "no, I don't think Jericho kidnapped no woman." But I had to give him something, you understand? Not really, ai. I had to break my own rules, Jericho. That's the best I can do for you, Ford. You're gonna have to shoot your own way out of this one. Go on. Give 'em hell, Ford. For all of us. [Gunshofl sorry. Come on. All right, I think we lost them. We got to get back to wasco. Mr. Ford? We'll go out the back. I think I've been shot. Okay. It's okay, Annabelle. We just need to get you back to camp, all right? Wasco's gonna fix you up. He's gonna fix you up. It's okay, it's okay. Hello, Mary. Wasco! Wasco! Wasco! Wasco! - What happened? - They were waiting for me. - Who? - The soldiers, Higgins boys. They attacked you while you were in camp? That's not part of the agreement. There's no more agreements. The bullet went through. We'll need some clean water, some cotton, either from your shirt or from your pillow. I do not care which. Well, is she gonna be okay? Is she gonna live? As long as you move quickly, we can save her life. You'll be okay, my dear. I promise you. Sir? This man claims to have information about Jericho Ford. Information, huh? Oh, I never claimed to have the information. What good are you to me? She is the one with the information. I say again, what good are you to me, then? I am the hilt in which the hand holds to do its bidding, sir. I don't have time for riddles. Speak plainly. I just watched Jericho fend off an infamous gang known as the Higgins boys. Now... I am confident that I am the only one who can kill Jericho Ford. Othennise, you can keep sending your men to do the job, but your bill to the undertaker? Well, that's gonna keep getting more expensive as the days wane on. The men out there are speaking as if this Ford cannot be killed. But I say, "if a man can bleed, he can surely die." You. Who are you in all of this? I'm no one. Well, clearly you're somebody of importance in this situation. If I may. I do believe I can extract the information out of her, given my methods. Who are you? Won't matter somewhere. The name's Oslo pike. And what do you want out of all this? The money? Two things and two things only. First, I want my name free and clear. I believe you can do that with a simple letter over to a Mr. Wells in Nebraska, explaining how my services were exemplary in the catching and killing of a notorious criminal in these parts. And the second thing? I want the honor of killing Jericho Ford. How do you plan on doing that? I am faster than he is. You make this sound like a dime novel, Mr. Pike. Oh, there have been plenty of them written about me, sir. Oslo pike. Bellevue, Nebraska. And you don't want any of the money? Fame and fear will buy you the world, captain. I have tasted both, and clearly the killing of Mr. Ford is surely gonna bring me more, therefore, I do not require your physical currency. You're an interesting character, Mr. Pike. Do we have a deal? Now... Have you ever seen an eyeball pop? It is a most interesting sight. You see... When a sharp object punctures it, it just deflates like a balloon. Some say that there is no pain. You see, but the fear is not losing the eyes. It's more complex. When you're plunged into complete darkness... There's no telling where the blade might out next. Hmm. They say a person can withstand a thousand cuts. Surely that would be painful. Close your eyes. Go ahead. Close them. Go on. Close them. - I said close them! - Ewmm Now I'm gonna give you one chance to tell me where Jericho's camp is, and if you do not, not only will I take your eyes and shroud you into eternal darkness, but I will make sure you are so disfigured that even dogs will walk away at the very sight of you. Mwmm open your eyes. You look at me. Where is he? She will live. I've seen that look in your eye many times before. Jencho. Jericho, where are you going? - Jericho, where are you going?! - What do you think? - To kill someone? - Is it so obvious? That will solve nothing. I don't need any of your preaching today. Just let me get it done. You know, you start coming into these odd, sort of bivouac shantytowns. Sometimes you want a break. I was gonna take a vacation. Take some days off for myself. I got a kid at home. Shelby. A man's still gotta make a living, and I am just well within my lawful rights to pursue the type of living that I'm doing. Pour that drink, Jose. You know, you took the lives... Of a few folk who were quite dear to me. Turn around. I don't like to shoot a man in the back. Well, I wouldn't give you the satisfaction. Be a shame to waste it. This seems familiar. Is it bad? You'll live to fight another day. Where's Mr. Ford? Returning soon. Try to get some rest. Where are you, boy? Come home now. Come home. [Gunshofl Where is he? I do not know. Suppose you don't have any idea when he'll be back, then? Do you? You know, I've killed a lot of people before. But I've never killed no injun before. It's no more pleasurable than taking any life. Oh, I doubt that very much. You see, I think your death is gonna contribute greatly to my cause. Evil men live only long enough to see their end. Well, I guess we must all die sometime. You tell Ford to meet me at the thoroughfare. Wasco. Annabelle. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It ain't your fault. It ain't your fault. I should've been here. I should've been here. It was that man. Pike. Jencho? What are you gonna do? I'm gonna see if the devil can bleed. You take up refuge near al's. Now, once Mary's free, you two stay by each other's sides, all right? You know how to use one? Okay, then. Off you go. Good to see you, Ford. I'm very glad you could join us. You see, Mary here... She was getting a bit lonely. And I thought I was eventually gonna have to put her out of her misery. Glad you showed up when you did. I see you brought your own personal autobiographer. You talk too much. Been accused of that, yes. Let her go, pike. Go on, Mary. Go give one last goodbye to your love. Are you okay? Annabelle's over there. You go join her. Anything happens, you both take the horses and get. I love you, Jericho Ford. Go on now. I've been waiting a long time for this. It's often hard you find someone you think is worthy of something like this. Goes back hundreds of years, you know. Dueling, that is. Oh, I'm familiar with my history. What do you propose? Simple, really. Each round, we draw. Each round, we get one shot. First man to fall is the loser. Perfect. He'll win. He has to win. Nothing is certain in this life, honey. All we can do is pray that Jericho's faster. Ah! [Gunshofl That's for my friend. It was exactly like I had read about... A showdown between two men to see who was the fastest. But as most would seek fame, I found one who was seeking salvation and love. A different type of gunslinger than one would think. A different kind of an outlaw altogether. Goodbye, my old friend. Just any other place in the world, loss was a factor of life here, a consequence of violence by violent men. But still, life goes on. And like Mary primm once told me, "bad people do get what they deserve." What is it? Leave me. Some men aren't made for the wild, and those that believe that they can tame it might lose more than they can ever possibly gain. Hello, miss angel. Do you know who I am? Yes, Mr. Hearst. Splendid. Quite the extraordinary story. But then, you're quite the extraordinaryjournalist, aren't you? Can you give me more of that? I can certainly try, sir. What this country needs is more stories like that. Stories that our children's children can recite and remember for years to come. Someday, outlaws such as this will be remembered as heroes. They may even become something of myth and legend. And it will be up to people like you to catalog and chronicle and express their stories, regardless of public opinion. For that is true journalism, my dear. The west is wild. And her name is freedom.
