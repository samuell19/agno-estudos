Great! Just great! Thank you, NYPD! Dispatch. I’m back. Car 28, you feeling lucky Sam? No. Guess who just got a special envelope from the NYPD. That sucks man. Maybe you’ll get a hot one tonight. No more pictures alright, I'm starting to feel like a peeping Tom. Yo, I got a question man. Why you work such long shifts? Didn’t you just pay off your car? Yes I did, all sixty-five grand of it. Great, speaking of that. You know that car is way too nice for this kind of work. No it’s not. I mean, if I’m going to be driving all night, every night I might as well enjoy it right? That’s smart. Okay, I’m not going to argue with that. Good point. Besides, I have my financial goals. I see you’re coming up on your pickup. Five dollars says she’s a smoker. Come on. No, I’m not taking that bet. Why? Come on, scared you'd lose? No, I can see her. She’s definitely no smoker. I’ll call you back. No, no, no. Look, the seats are leather. Yeah! Hey wakeup. You’ve got a pickup in five. Alright, got it. Hello. Hey, Car 28, we've got a busy night ahead. You know, I was thinking about that bet of yours. Okay, go on. So hypothetically if I did meet a girl in the car. A hot one. Wouldn’t it be a conflict of interest to chat her up? Sam, you got to think it through. I mean, it’s like saying no one in the office ever hooks up. It’s not that big of a deal. It happens all the time. And did you ever hook up at work? Well see, no. That’s never going to happen because I’m the only one who works in this office. The closest I get to a hot girl is you. So I have to live my adventures through you man. Yeah, I’m not interested. Okay, I'll tell you what. If you have a hot girl in the car, you wouldn’t try to get her number? No. What if that’s the only chance you’re going to get? It’s not professional. Okay, so what if she gives you her number? What’s the first pickup? You’re no fun. It's out in Jamaica. Really? How’d they get our number? It’s all good. I mean the phone number is verified. Not sure I want to take it. We can send another car there. But, what if she’s a hottie? In Jamaica? Come on. Well, you know what. Listen, circle first, and... if there’s a bunch of guys out there with guns. Then hightail on out of there. You bet your ass I will. Alright, check in later. Later. Looks clear. Any of those gangs you were talking about? Yo, I gotta go. Hey, what’s up? I’ll call you later. Here for a pickup? Pickup? Are you a driver? What was that? Hey, did you call for a car? Yo man, she doesn’t speak any English. The guy who called spoke perfect English. It's probably her boyfriend. Hey is she hot? Yeah, she's hot. Man I told you that car is way too nice. She probably thinks you’re trying to pick her up. Come on man just tell me some Chinese. Okay, say Jiao Che Siji. Si-ji. Siji. I am Siji. Dude, you gotta say the first part. Jiao Che. Don’t forget I want pics. Jiao Che Siji. Sorry about that. You new in town? The city is beautiful at night. You want me to put the windows down or the AC on? Sorry, my Chinese is terrible. All I really know how to say is Ni Hao Ma’am. Did I say that right? Ni Hao ma’am? Ni Hao... Ni Hao ma. Not bad, Siji. Siji. Yeah, I’m Sam. Sam? Sam Siji. Okay, Sam Siji, I guess that kind of rhymes. What’s your name? Lili. Lily. Oh, wow that’s a beautiful name. It’s very nice to meet you, Lily. Are you from China? You look Chinese. I can’t really tell between Koreans and Japanese, but I can normally tell if you’re Chinese. You know Indonesians and Malaysians are kind of hard to tell apart as well. Is it okay that I talk? Some people prefer I just shut up and listen. I guess you’re more the listening type. You know what, that's cool that’s absolutely cool. If at any point you want me to shut up, just tell me. Otherwise, I’ll just keep talking, and talking and I don’t really know what I’m talking about. Okay, here we are. Do you mind if I take a photo? Picture? Photo? Okay. Yeah. Okay, alright. Smile for the camera. What about your number? Number? Yeah, so I can send you the photo. No. No? I’ll just have to look at it myself. I think it’s that one right there. Have a great night Lily. Guess what I got? What? I got pics. I knew it man, alright send them over. You wouldn’t believe it. Did you get her number? No, and it’s all your fault for giving me dumb ideas like that. If you never ask, you never receive. Whoever said that never got gifts on Christmas. Speaking of Christmas, you can call me Santa because I happen to have the number from the pickup. Didn’t you say it was her boyfriend that... wait hold on. God damn she’s hot. Hold on. Hold on. Come back. Come back. Come back. No. Stop Get back here! Come on, come on! Are you okay? Go back. Take me back. Take me back now. I want to leave. Go back. Take me back. What are you saying? What is it? Go back! Back. Go back? Go to that guy? No, no, you’re not thinking straight. Please. Please go back. No, we’re not going back. Open the door! No I’m not opening the door! Stop here! Stop, stop here. Okay, fine, fine. Stop here! Fine. I’m stopped. You’re not thinking of jumping are you? Do you have any place I can take you? Like a mommy or a daddy? No mommy? No daddy? Friends? So you have nowhere you can go? It's ok. I will take you some place safe. Do you understand safe? Home. My home. I won’t hurt you. I promise. No money. It’s on the house. Free. That means you don’t pay. Okay? This is my humble apartment. I can afford something better, but I’m saving up to get my own place. Maybe start a family one day. You can’t get much in this neighborhood for this price anymore. These rich Chinese are just moving in and jacking up the prices. I’ve held onto this place since I was a student. I’m not from here, I’m from Kalamazoo, Michigan. It’s right there. Okay. You know snow. Snow, you know. Deer, lots of deer running around. It was kind of a shock to move here. Concrete jungle, trash all over the street, but the people, The people are interesting in this city. You know, I’m kind of a workaholic. Once I get my mind set on something I just kind of get obsessed. So far it’s been all work and no play. But you know that... That is the price of the American dream. American dream? Yeah, you know, the American dream. Do you have a dream? You know what, why don't... you just wait here. I'm just going to go get you some water. Oh, you something to drink drink. Okay. You know I was saving this for a special occasion. But... I think this might work. You know I did just pay off my car. Whoa... Slow down. Slow. Give me wine. I want wine. You know, I don’t think that’s such a good idea. Can I take see your cheek? It’s a little cold. Okay? My father used to hit my mother. Made me so mad I just wanted to beat him. But... He died when I was twelve, so I never got the opportunity to set him straight. Who was that guy you were with? Was that guy your boyfriend? Is that guy your boyfriend? Boyfriend? I hate him. My advice. Somebody hits you, you should run. Never look back. Wash. Shower? You want a shower. This way. This the hot water. And this is the cold water. You just turn it on and you’re good to go.

You’re killing me. Give me an address, something. Look, I was there last night. It was an Air BNB and he was long gone. But he did use this GPS tracking device on my car. This is a little low end even for the NYPD. What do you mean? It’s a consumer device knucklehead. You can get this at any five and dime. This is trash. We’d never be caught dead using something like this. So what does the real one look like? Oh I could show you but then I’d have to kill you. I’m kidding. It ain’t this though. I got a picture of him. Now we’re getting somewhere. It was taken in my car’s dashcam. Wow, you’re getting your ass kicked. Yeah I know, thank you. He’s assaulting you. You could press charges on this. And then he pulls out a police badge. Detective Ricky to you. Ricky Lau. Wait, you know him? Yeah, he’s on our wanted list. What? Yep, I got a good memory for faces. Comes in handy in this line of work. Yep. Alright, that’s him. He is... wanted for assault, failure to show up in court. There’s a warrant out for his arrest, but he’s not exactly big time. You mind? So he’s not a detective? No siree. But impersonating a police officer is a felony. So if you know where we can find him, you give us a call. You mind sending me a copy of this video. Sure thing. What if he was into human sex trafficking? Trafficking? Yeah. If he’s into sex trafficking, the judge will be more than happy to throw the book at him. Those sons of bitches are the worst scum on the planet. Alright, we’re done here. Have a good day Sam. That’s it? Have a good day Sam. Yeah, thanks. Hey, don’t forget your tracker James Bond. Thanks.

I was just looking for a girl. Hold up. We got lots of girls if you got the cash. I got some cash. Hand it over. I’m looking for Lily. That’ll only get you fifteen minutes with her. Fifteen minutes is all I need. Hmm, You sure you don’t want to hit the ATM first. You’re gonna want more time. No, fifteen minutes is enough. Upstairs, second door on the right. Don’t be one minute late coming out, or my guys are coming in after you You got it? Got it. Lily? Oh my God. How do you want me to please you? I’m not here for that. Then why are you here?

I didn’t take your money. Then who took it? I don’t know. I don’t know. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to. You should leave. How long? How long have you been doing this? I told you. Ricky forced me. Since my daughter was born. Four years. Is he the father? No, he isn’t. Before I left China, I had a boyfriend. He told me to go to America, he made the arrangements. I was a fool, I thought I loved him. We spent one night together. I didn’t know anything about sex then. I came here, they find out that I’m pregnant. It was too late to have an abortion, so they let me keep the baby. Then they used her to force me to be a slave. Said... I have to pay off my debt to them, or else they will never let me go. Let’s get out of here. Right now. I can’t leave. Why not, I can take the guy downstairs. No, no. He’s too big. I can’t leave you here. What about my daughter? What about her? They will hurt her. Where is she? Downstairs. I’ll go look for her. No Sam. This isn’t a game. These are bad people. I’m a customer. They’re not going to hurt me. No Sam, Sam. You listen to me. You have to leave. This isn’t your problem. Lily, I asked you to trust me, but I didn’t trust you. I’m so sorry I didn’t believe you. Ever since you left, I can’t stop thinking about you. Call me stupid, crazy, but I came here to find you and I’m not leaving you here. Sam Siji. You are stupid and crazy. Crazy for you. You have to leave. Your time’s up. I’m not leaving without you and Ting Ting. It’s impossible. Just tell me the truth. Did you take my money? No, I never lied to you. I swear I didn’t take your money. Okay, I believe you. You have to go Sam. Please, for me. You have to go. Well, well, well. Look what we have here. A sweet reunion. You have a lot of balls coming back over here Sam. Hope you’re a screamer. I’m going to enjoy this. Maybe we can make a deal. How much does she owe you? They’re not for sale. Only for rent. She told me she has a debt to you. How much? Damn Lily. What’d you do to this boy? I don’t remember nothing special about that whore. Don’t call her a whore you bastard. Bastard? No, no, no Sam. I know who my father is. What about Ting Ting? She owes me thirty thousand dollars! I have twenty-nine. I’m not here to make a deal with you. Twenty-nine is not thirty. I can get you the difference. Yeah. But we have a teeny, teeny tiny problem here. There’s two of them. Her daughter’s another thirty thousand. You do the math! I don’t have that kind of money. Then you can’t afford them. I was hoping you’d say that. Hold his face. Don’t forget to tell me how your teeth tastes. Ricky no! Get back you bitch! Why? Why! Why do you want to be a hero? Why can’t you mind your own business! Why?! Wait, wait. What! The car. The car for the girls. I could just kill you right now and still keep your car. You’re not a murderer. Alright, there’ll be questions. If they find you, they’ll put you away for life. My dispatcher is waiting for my call in an hour. If I don’t call, he’ll call the cops. I mean what do you think your colleagues will say when they show up and see your side job? Huh? You bluffing me Sam? Huh? Are you bluffing me? You want to find out? A little girl is bad for business. You know that. Trade her to me. I have the title right here. I’ll sign it over to you. Everybody walks away. Alright? I don’t know. You could still call the cops afterwards, and report the car stolen, and then now I have a car I can’t drive. I’m out sixty grand. I don’t know. Why would I do that? You’re a cop. Your word versus mine, remember? You know what. What the hell, I'm feeling generous today. You got yourself a deal pal. Name? Ricky Lau. How do you spell Lau? L, A, U. It’s all yours. Go get the girl. You sure about this Ricky. You sure about this Ricky? Just go get the girl! Worry about all the wrong things. Should worry about how he got his keys out of his pocket. I don’t understand. All this for... two worthless whores? With that type of car, get any girl you want. Why would you trade your car in for trash? I don’t see trash. I see a beautiful human being. Mommy! My baby. How sweet. You guys should get out of here before I change my mind. Where do you think you’re going? I can’t believe you gave up your car... For us? When I know what I want, I go get it. Sam, glad to hear your voice man! Can you send a car to pick me up? Send a car to pick you up why? Were you in a crash? What happened to your car? I traded it in for something better. What? We’re home, home! Are you hungry? Very. I called the detective the next day. But, by the time the police raided the house in Jamaica, it had already been abandoned. If you recall, I had Ricky’s consumer GPS tracking device. Conveniently, I had put it back into the car, and it was easy for the police to track him down. They raided his new brothel and freed all the other girls. Arrested all of his goons. They closed down the sex trafficking ring. They will never hurt Lily and Ting Ting again. We contacted an organization that helps sex trafficking survivors. Lily started a course in nursing. And the Feds arranged a visa for her to stay in the US Since they need her as a witness when the case goes to court. Ricky never filed the car title with the DMV, so the car never officially changed ownership. I got it back. Thank you NYPD. I will never understand why some people intentionally hurt others. Our time on this earth is precious, make every second count.
