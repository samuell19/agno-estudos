More than a thousand years ago, in the reign of the Emperor Suzaku... ...there lived a doctor of astrology named Kamo no Yasunori. He had a scroll, 'the Golden Crow', on the secrets of yin and yang. His task was to interpret the meaning of unusual natural phenomena. The doctor, however, had no children. An oracle told him to adopt as his child... ...a girl born in the direction, year, and on the day.. ...of the sheep. He gave two disciples the task of finding her. Their names were Ade no Yasuna and Ashiya Doman. Theirs were long, hard journeys, with no end in sight. Finally, in a village in Izumi, in the land of Kawachi... ...Yasuna found twin sisters, Sakaki and Kuzunoha. He took with him Sakaki, the elder sister... ...to be heiress to his master. Kuzunoha grieved at being parted from her sister... ...and stood weeping until she was out of sight. Ten long years and more went by.

Is this not an evil omen? Not even the legends speak of one. The hour of sunset has yet to come. That strange red hue... The greenery of the garden, the water of the pond... ...even our robes lose their color to it. Our very faces, too! Mount Fuji spat flame last winter. Its tremors have not ceased. Preying on people's fears... ...gangs of marauders sweeps at will in and out of the city. An occurrence like this will only add to the confusion. How are things in the city, Minister? I sent an official to investigate a short while ago. He should be returning soon. Everyone! General Ono has returned from the wars in the east! Look! Has something happened in the east? Fuji's erupted again. Maybe that's what caused the white rainbow. The earth's going to open up and swallow us! A rain of fire... A white rainbow... We're cursed! This is an omen. Chaos will reign in the land. What did you say, Father? There will be great disturbance, and the realm will split in two. Master! Ah, Yasuna... Of what is this strange phenomenon a sign? There will be great disturbance, and the realm will split in two. The realm?! That's all I can think. The white light transfixes the moon... This paddles even Kamo no Yasunori, professor of yin and yang. We must consult the Golden Crow. Sakaki, I need the keys you and my wife hold. Summon my wife! It's as I thought. What does it say? 'Be the sun transfixed, cursed be the emperor. 'Be the moon transfixed, cursed be his heir.' So the Crown Prince is cursed? Yes. What comes after that? That I may not say. We are your kin! I have no doubt of you This scroll is so important there are two keys to it. I may not reveal its content to any save my successor. The townsfolk are terrified. Does it say nothing of that? I must go to the palace and inform the Chancellor. Make ready. The palace? The Mikado faces civil war. I must hurry. I have, by the way, two favored disciples. You, Yasuna, have hurried here, eager to assist. Why has Doman not come? Doman is here! What kept you? Astonished at today's phenomenon, I went to the palace... ...and saw your wife's elder brother, the Minister of Civil Affairs. I told him that none in the realm but you... ...could interpret its meaning. You were putting in a good word for me? That's a little harsh... It is not! I am Kamo no Yasunori, professor of yin and yang. I am known to court. I am sure this is true, but you should hurry there. Everyone knows there is no one but me to consult on this omen. This precious scroll, 'The Golden Crow'... ...I have always thought to bequeath it to one of you. But no one who disgraces me will be my successor! Sakaki... your key. Akuemon, bring my horse. Akuemon... There are bandits abroad in the night. Be vigilant around the forest of Tadasu. You heard what my father said, Yasuna? He praised you and spoke harshly to Doman. What he said means he will name you... ...As his successor. Many things could happen... ...before he did so. I realize that. But why are you looking so morose? What are you brooding over? Are you so troubled you cannot even tell me? I do not understand what is in the Master's mind. And why is that? As you know, while the citizens of the capital... ...are too frightened to sleep... ...your father cares nothing, and thinks only of the Emperor. Yasuna... why have you not... ...spoken of this directly to my father? You need not answer. A gentle soul like you could never do that. But there is no one so ardent as you about his studies. That makes me glad. Lady Sakaki, you are the only one in this entire world... ...who understands me. Look at you! Are you in love with Sakaki? Of course not! She's a country girl from Izumi, daughter of a village squire... ...adopted only because she was born under the sign of the sheep. A girl of low birth like that, heiress to the master? When I have such a handsome young man here? Akuemon! Open the gate! It's the Master! Open the gate! What's happened? We were attacked by the bandits near Tadasu forest. We fought back, but the Master... has been killed. Master! Father! You cowards! You were there to guard him! Father! Master! I bore a message from His Majesty summoning Kamo no Yasunori... ...to the court. I am astounded at his sudden demise. I asked His Majesty what to do... ...and he said, 'He must have had a successor. 'Have him appear before me.' I'm sorry, but he died without naming a successor. He made no decision? By your leave... please give me the task... ...of interpreting 'the Golden Crow'. That would be best. None but Doman could interpret such a difficult text. One moment! You are the disciple Abe no Yasuna? I am. At a time so fraught with peril... ...if two went before His Majesty... ...and presented both their opinions... A fine idea. By your leave, as daughter of his house... ...I ask that you appoint me to carry out this task. I know something of his teachings. Perhaps I could expound on them in his place. Lady Sakaki... why did you take this role upon yourself? It was a trap. Mother plots to set you against Doman before His Majesty. He is far more glib of tongue. How could I let that happen to one so dear to me? I tremble to think of the palace. If anything happened to you... Have no fear. My father approved of our friendship. We must guard the Golden Crow with our lives. But if His Majesty should be displeased... I shall have no regrets on leaving this life. I ask only to do that with you. With me? Ten years have flown by since you took me from Izumi... ...and I came with you here to Kyoto. The ties of fate that bind us must be very strong. I feel the same way. Should you face His Majesty's wrath... ...I will not remain in this life. I will follow you in death. How happy I am to hear that! Hold me tight. Give me courage. Hold me! Tighter! Hold me! You are 'Sakaki'? I assume your father said something about this omen? What did he say? About this he said... 'Be the sun transfixed, cursed be the emperor. 'Be the moon transfixed, cursed be his heir.' I am cursed, you say? Why? The reason is... Feel free to speak. I surmise that, as Your Highness has no heir... ...the succession will be thrown into confusion. So if I do not beget a child... What can be done? I am very sorry. My father died having said nothing else on the subject. More than that I do not know. I am displeased that you would dare... ...to speak words of such weight, yet offer no remedy. Are you here only to trouble us?! With all respect, Minister, the dead cannot speak. Surely it is too much to ask that they do? Fiddlesticks! The people will be led astray if the court is not respected. This is treason! One moment... Sakaki, did your father not have an ancient Chinese scroll... ...called 'the Golden Crow'? Can a remedy not be found within it? Yes. But it can be understood only by my father's two disciples... ...Abe no Yasuna and Ashiya Doman. Then bring them here. I regret to say... ...that only my father's appointed successor may read it. I assume one of them is your father's successor? Before he departed this life, he said the name of Abe no Yasuna. By your leave.... My younger sister was wife to the late Yasunori. I have been told... ...he left no written proof of his intention. Is this true? Yes. Doman has told me... ...Yasunori said he would appoint him as successor. No! I am sure he said 'Yasuna'. On the occasion of this omen, Doman came straight to the palace... ...out of loyalty to his Master. I ask that he be named successor. No. Yasuna had so won Yasunori's trust... ...that he was given a name with the character 'yasu'. I insist that Yasuna be named his successor. We have no time to lose in this matter. I suggest the successor be named by the Imperial Command. I ask that it be Doman. One moment! The scroll lies behind the doors of the shrine at our residence. If a successor is named without divine guidance... ...even an Imperial Command will not suffice to open it. Then let us seek the divine will by sacred lot. Minister Iwakura, General Ono... ...I believe you both have family connection with the deceased. Go swiftly to his residence... ...and have both disciples draw lots before the shrine there. Wait. I am told the lots should be drawn with the scrolls itself in view. Lord Iwakura, as always, speaks wisely. Open the chest. What is it? The scroll... ...It's gone! Gone?! It does not suffice to say it is 'gone'. It did not simply vanish. Sakaki must have had someone steal it! Nonsense! Why would I? You have the key! Sakaki would never do that. And besides, you have the key to the shrine door. Perhaps you stole my key to open it. You've hidden the scroll away. I think you both conspired to do this! You dare accuse the descendant of an emissary to China... ...of theft?! We must abandon the drawing of lots. This matter is vital to the entire realm. We must return to the palace! Wait. This will shame the family. The court will be suspicious. At worst, this could destroy the family. Search this house, and find it! No! Sakaki is responsible for the key to the box! Seize her! That's unfair! Stop! You can't arrest her without evidence! Too many strange things have happened. First Yasunori dies suddenly. Then the scroll disappears... I swear to you... ...I will find the Golden Crow! Yasuna! You still won't talk?! How can I tell you what I don't know? Do what you will! I still don't know! You lie! You gave it to Yasuna! Father! The Golden Crow... Who took it? Where is it? Tell me! Yasuna! Yasuna! Sakaki! I can't bear it! Sakaki! Be strong! Sakaki! we'll show them you're innocent! Sakaki! There's no reason for this, you cowards! Sakaki! Sakaki! Akuemon, thats enough. Sakaki! Yasuna! You'll never take this house from me. Tomorrow I'll send you to the constable. Look well last her tonight. You won't see her again. Viper! Wait! Sakaki! Yasuna! We've tormented them to the full. Tomorrow we'll bing them and send them to the Magistrate. They'll both be decapitated. May they enjoy their journey to hell. And you, my sweet young prince, will succeed Yasunori. Milady! Milady! Milady! Sir! Sir! Sir! It's Milady! Sakaki! Wake up! Speak to me! Sakaki! She's dead! Why?! Sakaki! Hm? And what is this? The Golden Crow they were all so excited over. The scroll! How did you get this? It's real. My key opens the shrine doors... ...and Sakaki's opens the chest. While she was asleep... ...I took it from her bag and made another. You made a second key? How wicked! Now you'll rise in the world. I'll never let you go. But how will we explain that we have the scroll? Simple. We'll say Sakaki talked. She told us it was hidden in her room. And when we searched... there it was! The scroll! Give it back! Give it back! Fire! Fire! I have it! Sakaki! I have the scroll! Where are you? Lady Sakaki! Sakaki! Lady Sakaki! There you are! Sakaki! I have the Golden Crow! Oh, there you are... This is yours. You are the Master's heiress. Sakaki! where are you going? Sakaki! Sakaki! Tell me... Where has Sakaki gone? If her spirit is still in this world, let me see her once more. Or one like her. Yasuna! Yasuna! Yasuna! Yasuna! I can't bear it! 'Love, O love... 'Inside is emptiness... 'Never fall in love. 'Love like a wind... '...comes to him... '...rustling his kimono sleeves. 'A loving couple... '...is torn asunder. 'As petals of the cherry blossom... '...Scattered by the raging wind... '...he is driven mad. 'Love, unrequited... '...like a single kimono sleeve. 'As time passes... '...his hair grows wild and disheveled.' Lady Sakaki! Are you here? There! There! There! There! There! 'Glimpsed through a curtain... '...of falling leaves... 'The image of one he loved... '...long ago. 'From that image... '...comes a faint trace... '...of her scent. '"If there is one like her, tell me," he says... '...and wrapping himself in his kimono sleeve... '...he falls... '...collapsing... '...in a heap.' It's you! Milady! Mother! That ruffian is chasing me! That man? Begone! Give Sakaki back to me! Stand back! That's Yasuna! Yasuna! Sakaki's Mother! And Squire Shoji of Shinoda! Whatever brings you here?! I've come to see you and beg your forgiveness... ...but to see Lady Sakaki restored fills my heart with joy. Sakaki... Why do you shrink back so before your parents? We're to be married, after all! Come to me! You're mistaken! This is Kuzunoha, Sakaki's younger sister. Her twin sister! Sister? Her twin sister, you say? Yasuna! Whatever's the matter? We'll take him to our house. Grief and torment must have driven him mad. With proper care, he may return to himself. I will explain why I have requested this audience. In recent days, the eastern highway has become rife with horse thieves. While we have been investigating... ...pirates have begun marauding to the west, in the Inland Sea. These are difficult matters. We have taken stern measures... ...but now in the east, Taira no Masakado has risen in revolt... ...and Fujiwara no Sumitomo is about to rebel in the western sea. There are reports of natives rebelling in the north as well. I request that swift action be taken to quell these. Are Masakado and Sumitomo in contact, I wonder? I have no doubt. Do we know that? There is no proof... ...but there is one thing. The same rumor is to be heard in both east and west. And that is? Well? Fuji will again spout flame. This time the mountain will lose its shape... ...and as he will rain down over the entire realm... ...withering the crops. Ash will fill Lake Biwa... ...water will spill across Mount Hie, and send a deluge... ...over Kyoto. Poppycock! Order! And then? The land will split into two islands, east and west. Masakado will rule in the east, and Sumitomo in the west. They say the white rainbow was portent of all this. This is no laughing matter! The entire realm must know these rumors are groundless. Where is the scroll that was to resolve this? By your leave... One of Kamo no Yasunori's disciples Abe no Yasuna, went mad... ...and stole 'the Golden Crow'. He took it away, and his whereabouts are unknown. And why has nothing been done? Fine him! We are close to learning where he is. Soon... 'Soon' is not good enough. Immediately! We have to get our hands on the Golden Crow by any means possible. With it we will rule people's hearts. We have to find Yasuna and cut off his head. And then, Doman, the only one who can read the scroll... ...will be you. Are we understood? Before she died, Sakaki said... ...'Be the moon transfixed, cursed be his heir'... ...meaning the Crown Prince has to have a child. Whether it's true or not, the Emperor and the Prince are both very worried. Doman, while you still had the scroll... ...did you see anything useful in it? Yes. You did? What? It was this: 'Face the sun, and beneath your chamber... '...entomb the blood of a living white vixen. 'There embrace, and a child will come.' Excellent. I'll take the Prince some fox blood. We will do well once we've told him this! But where do we get the blood? You need have no concern, sir. I was born in Shinoda, Izumi. The forest teems with foxes. One of my men has seen an old white female there. I'll go to the palace You go fox hunting. Make ready! Look, Yasuna. The peasants are dancing to celebrate a good harvest. What a fascinating dance! I'll dance, too Come, Sakaki. Not again! Her name is 'Kuzunoha'. Be silent. Lord Yasuna is always so much happier... ...mistaking me for my sister. Sakaki... I wonder when your father will approve our marriage... When you are cured of your illness. Illness? I'm not ill! The Gods of my Master's shrine have granted my wish. Since they have returned you, I am fine, as you can see. They look like hunters. We'd better get back home. Why have you stopped dancing? We can't interfere with the hunters! Why have they stopped? They should dance more. Quickly! Make haste, Yasuna. The poor thing! A hunter's arrow... Madam... ...be strong. I know it was around here. Have you seen a white fox? A white fox? You can't tell a fox from a person? This is yours. We'll take you home. Bear up, Madam! Thank you very much. This my house. Thank you! Thank you very much! Go in. I'll tend your wound. Please, no! This is no place for a gentleman like you. We're very poor. No! Please! What's all this noise?! What have you done?! No, no! He saved my life! A hunter's arrow found me, and he tended to my wound. I didn't know. Forgive me for being so rude. Kon! Kon! Grandma! What happened?! I almost got killed! Then the gentleman talking to your grandfather... ...came and saved my life! She'll be all right? Please don't worry. Well, I hope so. This water's so clean! You can't drink that! I just meant to wash my hands. He's very handsome! Oh, no! He has a wife! That's not his wife. That's Kuzunoha, daughter of Squire Shoji. Take good care of her, old sir. We'll never forget your kindness. Farewell. Sir... May I know the name of the man Who saved my wife? My name? Abe no Yasuna Lord Yasuna... And your father is the village squire. You are too kind. Take good care of her. The poor thing... that arrow was meant for you. That villain Akuemon! He's found us! I'll never forgive myself if that young man comes to harm. Kon, go with them. Watch over them. If they meet any danger, come right back and tell us! I will. I'll call the others together. I hate hunting, the killing of living things. Do you, Sakaki? You are truly gentle, Yasuna. But when you call me 'Sakaki'... ...I pay it no mind. Yasuna! Submit to the rope! The rope? What is his crime? He is a dangerous man! He killed Yasunori's wife... ...and stole 'the Golden Crow'! Seize him! He'll have the scroll! Find it! Let go! Sakaki! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Yasuna! Go! We're safe now we've come this far. We won't be followed. Akuemon and his ruffians don't know these mountains. Here you can nurse him. Nurse him? By myself? Of course. I have to go back to tend to your grandmother. I can't do it alone! You won't be lonely. You owe Yasuna your grandmother's life. It would seem those villiains from the capital want him. We owe him his life for the one of ours he saved. Tell squire Shoji and the people in the village... ...that the foxes...no... That the Gods have spirited him away. You wait here until he recovers. That scroll is important. Don't bring it out, no matter what happens. But if he finds out what I am... He doesn't know that yet. I know... You saw Squire Shoji's daughter... Yes. She's beautiful! It's not a good thing to do, but if you took her form... ...he would never suspect. I become lady Kuzunoha? Yes. You transform yourself into her. But when he recovers his wits... ...what shall I say to him? When that happens... ...tell him this: Squire Shoji wants him to stay hidden here... ...until his name is cleared. Will you do that? Do you agree? All right, but... ...he's so handsome! I'll be blushing all the time. You? Blushing? But, Kon... ...one thing you must remember. Don't make a foolish mistake. Turn your back on your kind and walk a path you should not... ...and you will wander forever... ...outcast and alone. Alone? A debt is a debt, but a foe is a foe. We are born enemies of man. The moment he returns to his senses he'll abandon you. Do you understand? Of course I do. But if even for a day or two... ...I can be with him as a beautiful lady... ...I'm glad. I'm happy, Grandpa. Thank you. Stop being so sweet! You bring tears to my eyes. Now... ...make good our debt. Nurse him like no human ever would. Take very good care of him. There. Now your wounds will pain you no more. Are you awake? Lady Sakaki! Where are we? 'Sakaki' No, I am Kuzunoha. Did Squire Shoji... ...give us this house? Our home! Sakaki! I am not Sakaki... Don't be silly! Did I not promise you.., ...that if you faced death... ...I would follow you as well? Sakaki! You're mistaken! There's no mistake! 'Hold me!' Did you not say that? Please! Let me go! Grandpa! I have a vixen's heart! What will I do? Oh, Grandpa! What will I do?! What? 'Thinking the persimmon tree next door... '...is heavy with fruit... '...I peek into the garden... '...and what do I see there... '...but a woman in full bloom... '...weaving... '...in a wretched hovel... '...absently plying her loom. 'What can she be weaving? 'The father... '...prays his child will rise in the world... '...while melancholy and hardship... '...are the warp and weft... '...of the mother's heart.' Have you been left all alone? That mother of yours! I'll give her a talking to. I wouldn't do that! Would I, Baby? He wants his daddy! I just left him there to call you. I wish we could go see his grandparents. How happy they'd be to see... ...such a sweet little lad. We mustn't! Why shouldn't we? I've told you and told you! The other day, when I took cotton to the village... ...I heard that General Ono had chased some pirates ashore at Settsu. General Ono? Yes. The pirates seem to have fled here to Izumi. The soldiers are watching for them. Put leaving out of your mind. I remember! I heard Lords Taira and Fujiwara had rebelled... Then came that white rainbow... The Golden Crow! Someone's taken it! we have to find it and take it back to Kyoto! It holds the secrets of the curse on the Crown Prince! Is that the Crown Prince's scroll? We'll go in state. Our son will give it to him. He'll be an astrologer, too! Let's go to Kyoto. I have to! I know! We'll leave tomorrow! Get ready! We cannot. We can't? Why not? If we do, we'll walk into a trap. A trap? The autumn fields... '...are full of traps... '... set to catch foxes. 'Each trap is baited with delicious food... '...but don't let it catch your eye. 'Eat it and you die! 'All we foxes... '...from the time we were small... '...have learned this: 'Man is vicious and cruel.' Oh, we're out of firewood. If you'd like a change of air, why not go and cut some? All right. You're a good man! Bring as much as you can. I will. There, there, don't cry! That's a good baby... Go to sleep... Go to sleep... There, there... 'My baby's daddy is a good man...' But his words just now... ... pained me like a needle through my heart. The day I give him that scroll... ...is the day we part forever. With such a beautiful child as you... ...why must I give it to him? This love, all the more real for its passion... ...and this joy... Though it has brought us you... ...one day his madness will end. '"When he learns what I really am... '"...what will I do then? '"I will not think of it. '"I will not think of it. Is this the house? There are no other houses here, and this is the right road. It must be this one. But would Yasuna really live in such a hovel such as this? Let me go and see. Hello! Is there a gentleman named Yasuna here? Hmm...I don't see anyone. 'He steps up... '...to the window... '...and is astonished at the resemblance.' Tell me, wife... ...is this indeed Kuzunoha, our daughter? what foolishness is this? Who is it, if not Kuzunoha? Do my eyes then deceive me? There is my daughter, at her loom. In this wide world, it is true, people bear resemblances... ...but unless Sakaki has returned from the dead... Go and see for yourself. What'll we do with you! Sometime you make me wonder. '"Oh, my! Squire Shoji!" '"Words fail me! '"Is that the real Kuzunoha? '"Is that the real Kuzunoha? '"Even a mother's eyes cannot tell. '"I am in confusion unto madness!'" Well! Squire Shoji! Yasuna! We've searched and searched for you! I don't understand... I've been longing for the day I could come to see you. Is it safe now? What do you mean? You make no sense. Please, greet my daughter. Oh, I see! You came while I was gone, had her change clothes... ...and act as if you'd just brought her here. All this is a joke on poor old Yasuna! Imagine! My wife acting as if she'd just come to visit me! I regret that you have not allowed us to bring our child to you. Your child? Yasuna! Is that your child? Since the Gods spirited you away... ...my daughter has been sick with love for you! My wife has been ill? Don't be silly! Don't tell me you've been living with the spirit of Sakaki! Please! don't make fun of me. Yasuna! Pull yourself together! Yasuna! Why are there two Kuzunohas? Please, tell me! I don't know! I don't know! Perhaps I've been dreaming... 'How vexing! How mortifying! 'Years of sacrifice, to no avail... 'Now the truth is revealed... 'Mother and child are sundered... '...and now it is thus... '..that she must leave.' Sakaki here... Sakaki there... I don't understand! What's happened here?! Yasuna, calm yourself... Open the door! Please! I cannot. I cannot open this door. Please! The truth is that I am not human. I am the grand-daughter of the fox whose life you saved. To repay our debt of gratitude, I took the form of Kuzunoha... ...and while I was nursing you... ...my heart led me into the sin... ...of a love that can never be. The griefs of the realm of animals... ...exceeds the human by hundreds of times. Wait! Wild beast though you may be, we still have a child! Open the door. Talk with me! Please! Open the door! I will leave the child. I will leave him for you to raise. Lady Kuzunoha, I have borrowed your form... ...and in it gone so far as to bear a child. Please do not think harshly of me. Mother is going to leave you. Grow up to be a fine man. '"Never act in a way... '"...that people will laugh at you... '"...and scorn you... '"...and say you are how you are... '"...because your mother was a fox.'" Open this door! I cannot let you leave me this way! My grief at leaving you is vast... ...but now I am revealed... ...I must never see you again. No! You mustn't leave! Let them scorn who will! I will feel no shame! Do not toment me further. Please...let me leave in silence. '"Your mother will always be with you... '"...and watch over you all your days.'" '"if you love me... '"...come visit me... '"...in Izumi. '"In the forest... '"...of Shinoda. '"there Kuzunoha waits... '"...in sorrow."' 'If you love me, come visit me in Izumi... '...in the forest of Shinoda There Kuzunoha waits in sorrow.' This is very strange! The hut had disappeared... ...leaving only a meadow of dried grass. This must be the work of spirits! A meadow... Was our house here only a dream then? Yasuna! Have you come to your senses? Squire Shoji! Kuzunoha... The Golden Crow! My fox-wife! 'Love, O love... 'Inside is emptiness... 'Never fall in love.' The End
