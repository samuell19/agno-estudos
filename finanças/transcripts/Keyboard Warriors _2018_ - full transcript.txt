How old are you? I'm 26, born in the Year of the Monkey. What happened to your face? I bought Russian facial cream on Taobao. I used it for a week and this happened. How did you find out? I was sleeping with my boyfriend one night. After we had sex, he stuffed his fingers up my nose angrily for no reason. What's your occupation now? Why are you laughing? Is it that funny? Watch where you're going. This one's good. Go watch it back at home. Are you OK? Your leg's bleeding. What's this? Is this a scam? Hey, you're the one who hit him. You should've watched where you were going instead of playing with your phone. How could you assume I was playing with it? Watch where you're going! You're the one who hit me. Watch out for cars! My leg might have to be amputated. Are you insane? I just want an apology, yet you're accusing me of scamming? Registered car owner: Vincent Chan Mobile phone number? Vincent Chan, movie screenwriter Enjoys going to the gym Movie screenwriter attacked men in gym after he suspected he was molested by them Oh, Vincent Chan. You're Vincent Chan. —What? —You've put on weight lately. Haven't you been going to the gym? You wore tight leggings to the gym and —got into a fight with some gay men. —What? —You're really awesome. —What? You're toast, faggot. We'll post about you on Golden Forum. You'll be in trouble. I suddenly feel very guilt-ridden. I'm really sorry, guys. It hurts. I feel really guilt-ridden. —Let's go... —Look, my screen's cracked. Take this money to fix your screen... Look at my screen first. —Don't make this a scam. —Fix your screen. —Drive carefully in future. —Go... It's really hot, isn't it? Enjoy the air-conditioning. The view just now was magnificent, right? —Yes. —It was beautiful. Shall we go shopping now then? Again? We already did that. You've to dress nicely. Women and gay people shouldn't be allowed to drive in this world. You went a little overboard though. Cut the crap. Here's HK$1,000 for you. That's more like it. Does he know how to drive? Yeah. He cut into our lane all of a sudden. Darn. That's money! There's a lot of money! It's all over the place! —Let's grab some. —No, there're cameras around. Let's go pick up the money! No, everyone, be careful. There's a lot of money. I'd be a fool not to pick it up. —They're grabbing the money. —Cover up... There's a windfall at Tsim Sha Tsui. Police! Freeze! Stop what you're doing. Put the money down. Don't do anything that you'll regret. Kei, we're toast this time. Was it a movie set with all those cash? Cash spilled out from an armoured van! I picked up a lot of money. I feel great. It must've been an inside job. The mainlanders have defeated us again with their money-picking skills. The bus just crossed the border. I've missed the chance. That's amazing. I hope I can lay hands on it too. The lost banknotes belong to China Kincheng Bank. They were transported by Q4S Security Services Limited. Officials are calculating the amount lost. Can we hear from the off-duty police officer who reportedly stopped the people from picking up the money? She just happened to pass by. She's made her statement at the station. What's the police's next course of action? We have a statement to make. Picking up items on the street that don't belong to you constitutes a criminal offence. We hereby appeal to those who picked up the banknotes to return them to the police immediately. We will do our best to retrieve the missing banknotes. Good morning, everyone. —Madam. —Madam. OCTB will handle this armoured van case. Or Nam was the first to arrive at the scene and I want her to be in charge of this case. Her? Or Nam, you shall lead the operation. Ghost, Little B and Meng Fai, you shall be in charge of collecting all the CCTV footages. Check every clip and identify the people who picked up the money. Let the CIB conduct facial recognition. Our goal is to complete this phase of investigation within 72 hours. The golden 72 hours? Is this an earthquake? Stop clowning around. You're right. This isn't an earthquake. Let's do it within 24 hours then. I want everyone to obey Or Nam's orders. Get moving. —Yes, Madam. —Yes, Madam. Madam, this is a huge case. Are you really letting me take charge? With your experience and capabilities, you should've become an inspector. Don't assume that you can't get promoted. Crack a huge case and you'll have a chance. You happened to be the first on the scene. It makes sense for me to put you in charge. Do your best. Be quiet! This is a petty person. She just happened to pass by. She's made her statement at the station. We have a statement to make. Yesterday's incident stirred up a storm. ...constitutes a criminal offence. We hereby appeal to those... Are you done? You've been dancing for an hour. I'm really feeling peeved. We couldn't take the money right before us. Let's dox those people who took the money. Can you let off steam quietly? How am I supposed to do that quietly? Use this. It's a pretty good design, but it's a bit dry. Just use some olive oil. Remember to clean it after you use it. Hello, Dad. What's the matter? Have you found a job? I've told you I'm a freelancer. What do you want to do? You're always cooped up at home playing video games or touching yourself. You've grown up, yet you can't even afford Gua Sha therapy. I can't rely on you to provide for me. All right, I got to go. I've a call. Maybe it's a job offer. I'm hanging up. Goodbye. Actually, your father's right. You need to find a job. What about you then? Where's the butter? What exactly happened back then? I don't know how the door popped open, so... I don't know what happened. Why did the door pop open so easily? Actually, most armoured vans were modified from normal trucks. Maybe it was an old lock, so the door just popped open. Why didn't you use security boxes then? Is it unusual not to use security boxes? They're small and expensive. As far as I know, there should've been a manager on duty driving his or her car alongside the armoured van. Why wasn't there a manager that day? There was no one available. Nowadays, it's hard to hire people, especially those with both a driving licence and a security officer licence. We noticed from the CCTV footage that you intentionally overtook the armoured van. How do you explain that? Madam, I feel really guilt-ridden. There was something wrong with my car. It's already been scrapped. Sorry, I won't do it again. When did you discover the cash was gone? After we returned to the company, we saw what happened and called the police. There were CCTV cameras everywhere. You can just check the footages. Good grief, Madam doesn't need you to teach her how to do her job. Madam, am I right? Madam. How's the progress? What progress? I haven't even had dinner yet. That's funny. Who's stopping you from having dinner? Madam, we've identified 16 people. But many of the other images are blurry. How much money was lost approximately? According to the security company, each stack was HK$500,000. That means they've lost about 10 to 20 million dollars. Hello? Hello, Sis, I need to entertain my boss tonight. Entertain your boss? Do you work in stock markets or a nightclub? All right, I know. Anyway, I'll be back late tonight. Don't wait up for me. —I'm hanging up. Goodbye. —Hello? Give Ying Ying a seat. I've made some money in stocks today. Everyone here will get HK$1,000 for every glass of wine you drink. Did you see that? I downed one glass of wine after another. You've some guts. Our boss is a petty man. I'm not afraid. I've yet to settle the score with him for making me lose money with false intel. I'm considered kind enough by taking only HK$50,000 from him after drinking like a fish tonight. —Taxi. —But how did you know he'd be generous tonight? He's always been so tacky. He likes to give out money when he wins. I'm willing to risk everything for money, even my life. Taxi. Why did you drink with your boss again? I knew he'd be giving out money today. So... I went to get the money. How much money did he give out? Give it to me. I love you the most, Sis. Sis, actually, I've been thinking... Hey. Sis, I... All right, let's talk about it inside. But... Sis, I've been scammed financially and sexually. Sexually? At least you enjoyed the process. No, I'm not going to pursue that. But I've been cheated out of all my money. I don't have a cent to my name now. Why didn't you call the police? Well, you're a policewoman. You've to dial 999 to call the police. You're a civil servant. Sis, just help her. She's really pitiful. Help her? Isn't it enough that I'm helping you? Now, I've to help your friend too? Do you think this is a childcare centre? Give me a break. I need to go back to work later. Is it that time of the month for her? Or is she... Keyboard Warriors Milk Powder They didn't all back out, did they? None of them showed up? They were only paying lip service. Let's go. I'm Captain Steel Penis. Why are you behaving sneakily? You're wearing a face mask too. Protecting your identity on Golden Forum is common knowledge. I'm AFCD Virgin Employee. I'm actually studying medicine right now. So you're still a virgin? It's just a username. You couldn't possibly have a steel penis either. You're right. Hello, everyone. I'm Love Sucks Forever. You're too girly for such a username. That's none of your business. Is that all? Is anybody else still hiding? I'm here too. I'm Attack and Defence. We're going to do something righteous. Why do we have to be so shady about it? Sorry... I'm late. Hello, everyone. I'm Mencius' Mum 3000. You're the most positive one. Have a seat. All right, we're all here. Let me introduce myself. I'm William Chan Carpark. I'm Joyce on the Cliff. OK, let's get down to business. Many people picked up the money spilled from the armoured van two days ago. Some even uploaded their photos online. We were at the scene at that time and we shot some footages. This photo looks like it was taken at On Yeung House, Heng On Estate, Ma On Shan, between the 26th to 30th storey of an apartment numbered between 10 to 16. How do you know that? Look at the background. I went to school there when I was a kid. I could tell just from the angle. We don't even need to check the IP address. OK, I'll see if I can find anything in the Heng On Estate Foodies group. Check and see if you've any friends living at Heng On Estate. Connect the accounts to see if you can find anything. I've found him. This guy's called Peter Chu. He has many photos on Facebook with a similar background. But here's the crucial point. Do you see this bracelet? See? It's exactly the same. I'm almost certain it's him. Yes. Post it on Golden Forum and let the police follow up from there. So that's HK$7,000 accounted for. But there's still a lot of money missing. Should we track the people down one by one? If we've to track them down individually with only the few of us at work... Anything can be done with technology. Let's get more help. You're right. With online celebrities becoming movie stars and web stories made into movies, we must show those straitlaced people that the internet's a place of hidden talents. I've started a post on Golden Forum as we speak. Know anything about the cash spill from the armoured van? We want your intel. We don't have experience in solving cases, but we're experts in doxing. We call this Operation This Is It. We are Hero! They are Zero! That's dumb. There's even a slogan? This is embarrassing for a shy guy like me. It's OK. Everybody has their own 15 minutes in the limelight. Come on, brothers, here's our chance. After days of investigation, the police have started arresting the people who were involved in the cash spill incident on Mody Road. Since noon today, two men have been arrested and HK$64,000 in cash has been retrieved. This was possibly part of the money spilled from the armoured van days ago. Hong Kong's really a land of fortune as millions of dollars fell out of a van —in Tsim Sha Tsui. —Stop filming. —But this isn't a joyous windfall. —Ladies. With intel from an online forum, the police have found those suspected of bagging the cash. I don't lack money. It was unintentional. I just wanted to return the money to the rightful owner out of kindness, but I don't know who the owner is. You're still filming? As the ancient adage goes, finders keepers. The person who threw the money away as trash should be fined HK$1,500 for littering. There's no reason to fine me. That's insane. Let's hear from those without windfall luck. How much money could I have picked up? Enough to cover my down payment? I doubt it. The money picked up must be returned soon. I know people are investigating this online. What about the security company? I've spoken to them. There're many armoured vans in operation that were modified from normal trucks. I've investigated the staff. The GM, Wan Chi Chung, has been working in Q4S for eight years. The two security officers have worked there for three and four years respectively. None of them have criminal records or debts. There's nothing suspicious. They won't benefit from losing the money. They didn't get to enjoy the windfall, yet they've to bear the responsibility. So all of you think it was an accident? I don't think there's anything suspicious. Does that mean we can close the case? I wouldn't dare to teach you what to do. Madam, we've checked the CCTV footages. Those tourists picked up much of the money, but we aren't able to track them down. They returned to the mainland that same day. What about the people from Hong Kong? Those identified by facial recognition have returned the money. Sis, are you coming home for dinner tonight? If you can't make it, we can have supper instead! From Or Chi Ying In less than a day, more than a dozen clips have been uploaded. This person called Lo Fun Brainiac claimed he has a PhD in Mathematics. He calculated the capacity of the three cash boxes and created a simulation of the remaining space by factoring in the size of the banknotes and deducting the retrieved amount. There's at least HK$22 million missing. You said you'd help me watch the clips, yet you're texting a girl? She's seeking help. What do you mean? I've been scammed. Can you guys help me? She claimed she was financially and sexually scammed by this guy called Fisherman from Central. So I sent her a private message. We can't benefit from the cash spill case, but we might benefit from helping a babe. This restaurant's expensive. Are you the one who's being scammed? It's fitting for a pretty babe. She said their macarons are delicious. That means you're being scammed. Don't get all flustered when you see her. Luckily, I don't look like a nerdy bachelor. But you might once you start talking. As I told you, she's a pretty babe. Have a seat. Don't look so desperate. We're doing a good deed after all. Yes, I must have some integrity. Hello, are you the Keyboard Warriors? How could you tell? You guys look so nerdy, so I figured it must be you. Try the macarons here. Are there only the two of you in the group? Are you really up to the task? You may leave if you don't trust us. We're here to help you. Please show some courtesy. I just wanted to be sure. He's kind of mean. That's how talented people are like. Ignore him. This is how nerds talk. Tell us what happened to you. I met this scumbag online. His username's Fisherman from Central. He seemed OK at first. I only found out later he was a con man. So he conned you to get into your pants. What? You were conned into having sex? That's not the point. The point is that he tried to steal my credit card to buy an iPhone. Once, he even told me that he'd take me to meet his parents. But I was left waiting on the streets for four hours. That turned out to be a decoy. He ended up going to my house and stealing my money. —That's outrageous. —Exactly. Never mind. We shall protect you from being bullied. We'll dox him and shame him on the internet. That's great! You're awesome. How did you know what I was thinking? Maybe we have a special connection. Actually, I do most of the doxing. You do? I shall count on you to help me dox him. He's cheated me out of all my money. He has more than 10 fake Facebook accounts. He does different postings in Facebook with these identities. He also uses the Golden Forum and social apps to meet and con girls. How do you know that? It's just my suspicion. Look, there's nothing in this account. This is a low-resolution profile picture. This hasn't been updated in a year. And this account only shares farming news. I've looked into his email account. I suppose Sammy Lau is his real identity. Is this Sammy Lau? Yes, it's him. You're awesome. You were able to dox him. Madam, you wanted to see me? You can stop working on the case. Why? The losses can be accounted for with insurance claims. Is that why you put me in charge? You knew this would be a dead-end case. Did you really think you could get promoted? I didn't expect to get promoted. I've long known that we don't get to make many choices in life. Sis, Wai proposed to me. The Or sisters defaulted on their loans. Or Chi Ying, I'm not getting married. Pay up Wai wants to break up with me. I wonder what I owed you in my past life. Boss, are you brushing up on your pool skills? Nice. Boss, you've a call. There's a document you need to sign. What's up, Richard? I'm playing pool. Yes. I've placed it over there. Regarding 8689, I've talked to George about it. We'll increase the price to 80 cents when the market opens on Monday morning. We'll see the outcome in half an hour. Aren't you afraid you'll get caught by Boss for slacking off? He's in the office today. My salary only covers half a day of work. The market's been pretty quiet lately. It's only right that I take half a day off. What are you looking at? Designer bags. I'll leave you to it then. I'm heading back to the office. —Goodbye. —Goodbye. You may place your bets now. Open for betting Confirm No more bets can be placed. Please wait for the cards to be dealt. Seven points for the player. Two points for the banker. The player wins. You may place your bets now. Hey. Go in. Miss Or. You're two days late on your payment. It's just two days. There's no need to get physical. Give me two more days. Two more days? I need to collect the interest then. —What do you want? —What do I want? Since you're two days late, it'll be two slashes on your face. —No! —Stop fidgeting. Come here. —What do you guys want? —Sis. You might be a police officer, but a debt must still be repaid. Don't you have HK$100,000? I... Are you serious? I tried my luck at gambling and made another HK$300,000. You gambled again? I got a Hermes bag with HK$300,000. I plan to share it with you. You need to see a doctor. Go ahead and slash her face. Ladies, please stop messing with us. Madam, stop messing around. Since your sister said that, I'll make two slashes on your face. —Come here... —No. Stop fidgeting. Come here... Get a grip. —Take these and sell them. —No! What do you mean by that? How can I be sure they're not knockoff bags? Here's the receipt. This lady wouldn't buy knockoff bags. Get going. Be punctual with the next payment. Let's go. Sis. Sis, don't be mad. The tables have turned. HK$300,000 is peanuts to us now. As I told you before, you can't spend the money recklessly. All right... just simmer down. Ask me about getting through customs today. Did you encounter any trouble? I think if we dress decently and travel during peak hours, it's not likely for us to get checked. You'll need to make 49 more trips if you carry HK$200,000 each time. You're right. Besides, all those frequent transactions might arouse suspicions too. Or should we just carry the cash directly? Do you know how big a stack of yuan is? I just want to clear the debt soon. Stop buying handbags then. I don't have the bags anymore. I didn't intend to tell you, but... Regarding 8689, I've talked to George about it. We'll increase the price to 80 cents when the market opens on Monday morning. We'll see the outcome in half an hour. 8689 was worth 19 cents when the market closed on Friday. We'll quadruple our earnings in half an hour. Don't even think about it. He's fooled you before. That was different. He gave me false intel intentionally, hoping that I'd help him. But this is straight from the horse's mouth. The tip about the armoured van was real too. It'll be quadrupled profits in half an hour, mind you. That's enough. I won't let you speculate in stocks again. Are you at work right now? Yes, I'm working. That's always been my reply to your mumbling queries for the past three minutes. What exactly do you want? Nothing. I'm hanging up then. Goodbye. Jun? What's it, Dad? Kit, Uncle Chung's company is hiring. I can refer you there. Uncle Chung? Isn't he a security guard? Yes, he is. Are you kidding me, Dad? I'm a professional. You're asking me to be a security guard? You're only fit to be called a professional if you have a profession. If you're jobless, you're worthless. What's wrong with being a security guard? You'll have all the time to surf the net which you enjoy anyway. It's great for you. I'm not surfing the net for fun. I'm helping people seek justice. You're making me worried with all this big talk about justice. Kit, can you please stop talking about justice? You taught me to have a sense of justice. Even so, you still need to feed yourself. Money won't just fall into your lap. I've told you that I'm a freelancer. Are you going to take up the offer then? Let me think about it. We'll talk later. I think that job suits you. Just focus on dreaming about that girl. Left. Down. Up. Sis, your eyesight's terrible. What should we do? You won't get into the police academy at this rate. I've an idea. I heard that laser surgery really works. It'll restore your eyesight to perfection. I've checked. It costs more than HK$40,000. If I fail this time, I'll just save up for another year and try again. Are you crazy? Do you know how embarrassing that was? Being an escort is already an embarrassment. An escort? I'm a PR executive. I don't need to accept outcalls. When did you become so greedy? You weren't so money-grubbing in the past. I'm a money-grubber? Yes, I've changed, but stay out of my business. Stay out of your business? Mum entrusted you to me before she died. If she hadn't, I couldn't have cared less. Stop caring then. I'm 18 years old. I'm already an adult. Stay out of my business. Hey! Sis, what's the matter? Did you just ignore everything I told you? What are you talking about? Where did the HK$200,000 go to? Relax. We agreed to split the money evenly, so I used my share to invest in stocks. That sum of money wasn't meant to be used. I've already made my stand. Can you get rid of this gambling addiction? So what if you've made your stand? You're exactly like your dad. You're addicted to gambling and you like making easy money. This world doesn't work that way. Your dad was neck-deep in gambling debts. And he ended his woes once and for all by jumping off a building. How old were we back then? Can you stop talking about the past? I'm talking about the past because I don't want you to make the same mistake. Yes, I'm like my dad. I love gambling and I'm a money-grubber. You're an angel while I'm a loser who only loves making easy money. Does that make you happy? You just don't realise the mess you've made. What mess? What mess? You're saddled with debts. Debt collectors showed up in my office and at home. I don't even know if I'm a police officer or a criminal now. I didn't hold a gun to your head. My dad's a security officer. He says that using plastic boxes to carry cash actually isn't acceptable. A proper security box must contain a sensor and liquid explosives. In case of an accident, it'll detonate, destroying the cash inside. But I dare say 90 percent of the security boxes don't have explosives installed because destroying the box might cost more than its contents. Since that's the case, they might as well just use plastic boxes. That's the most common procedure. That means there's nothing suspicious. Stop hitting me. —Where's the money hidden? —What money? Are you messing with me? Hit him. I don't know anything. Don't hit me. —Hit him harder. —It hurts! —Tell me. —I don't know anything. Are you trying to call the police? I wanted to, but I dare not. I'm sorry. I knew you wouldn't dare to. That's enough. Search his body. Yes. This has nothing to do with me. I just met him today. —Did you find anything? —No, Boss. You were hooking up with a guy you just met? You're being bold though I just met you too. Let's go. Come on. Sis. Jun just called and said she was harassed. That's none of my business. You're smart. You can handle it on your own. No, the point is that the new guy she met picked up the cash at Tsim Sha Tsui too. He got doxed on Golden Forum for no reason and people started harassing him. I think this has spiraled out of control. Did she call the police? No, she only sought help from two nerds on Golden Forum. Sis, I can't do anything without you. Let's transfer the money out soon. Aren't I smart? We can change at least HK$80,000 to yuan for our road trip to Guangdong province. All the money can easily be changed to yuan before we even reach Shenzhen. Yes. Start the car. Ladies, where are you going? Your payment's due. Give us two more days. We'll clear the debt two days later. This is a cross-border car. Are you fleeing? We don't owe you a huge sum of money. Why would we need to flee? We already said we needed two days. So does that mean I've made a wasted trip? So? What can you do to us in public? —Hey! —Here's the key. You'll have it back in two days. Hey... Steel Penis and I didn't find anything amiss after checking the bank records of the two security officers. That's awesome. How did you get access to their bank records? I work in a bank. It was a piece of cake. But the problem is, do we need to delve even deeper? Like hacking into their website? As a legal professional, I must warn you that it's illegal. I didn't say that. I'm not a hacker. But she broke the law by making unauthorised checks on bank accounts. But it's OK. Throwing a cigarette butt is also illegal. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Take a seat. It's so hot today. Which genius suggested an outdoor meeting? And this lady is... She's a witness. Look at this. Do you recognise this person? I do. He's one of those who picked up the money. We've doxed him on Golden Forum. Someone posted that he didn't get arrested. It was because they couldn't find the money. Next, he was attacked by a gang that wanted to know where the money was. I witnessed that. That means someone knew he took the money and wanted to rob him. Think about it. He wouldn't call the police even if he was really robbed. You're right. These three people are the attackers. Are you able to uncover their identities? How? Their faces were covered. It's OK. We'll post it on Golden Forum. According to the Six Degrees of Separation, everyone in the world is separated by only six or fewer links. What does that mean? To cite an example, Kim Jong-un would be a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend. So we're more interconnected than we imagine. I agree. But who'd dare to post it? These guys are fierce and violent. It's a huge risk to take. Why don't you do it? IT should do it. Me? I can't. I don't have the guts to do it. Are you getting cold feet? I thought you guys were righteous. I... I'm really having cold feet. You do it. Hey. I think I know who robbed the guy. Who was it? Look, the guy in the picture was wearing a green G-Shock watch. Mencius' Mum 3000 was wearing that too. Could it be just a coincidence? Of course not. When I showed the picture, he took off his watch immediately. He must've had a guilty conscience. —No wonder... —You guys noticed that too? Why were you eavesdropping on us? He must've befriended us, knowing that we had good intel. He waited for us to expose the guy who took the money before robbing him. What a scumbag. He made use of us? It's OK. Let's expose him online and let the police arrest him. All right. Mencius's Mum 3000 - the warriors' saboteur Priscilla Wong's Perfect Body I'm walking. Stop pushing me. We tried to uphold justice, yet he exploited us. He's ruined our reputation. Hey... —Jun saw him. —Really? Let me get ready. We're counting on you. —I'm sorry... —Are you kidding me? —I can pay for the dry cleaning. —It's OK. You can send me the receipt via WhatsApp. Sure... —I'm really sorry. —My number's 96709394. —I'm Raymond. —I'm Chloe. —Call me then. —Send me the receipt. Goodbye. With this simple software, I can hack into his WhatsApp account and view all the contents. I'm in. It was so thrilling. I felt like a spy. Be quiet and leave the scene cautiously. OK, I'm going back. OK, see you later. There're 8.8 gigabytes of data? That must be a lot of stuff to view. It'll take forever. All right... My mission's completed. You guys can take over from here. Golden Forum has become notorious for doxing with all the forummers remaining anonymous. But their doxing abilities have stirred up an exciting online buzz. This is the end of our special news report. I didn't expect the kids on Golden Forum to have outwitted the police. Why don't I transfer the money out first? Hey, I've made a major discovery. Why don't I go with you? We don't need two people to do the job of one. Don't worry, it'll be fine. —Surprise! —Hey. Sis. I've two reliable friends from Golden Forum to help you on the cash spill case. Call her Sis. Are you trying to expose the money pickers because you didn't manage to pick up any? So what if we are? Luckily, you stopped us the other day. Otherwise, we'd have been the ones doxed. I'm ready any time. Let me know when you've a date set. Create a huge fiasco out of it. Find a busy area. Tsim Sha Tsui then. If it's OK, I'll make arrangements for next Thursday. What does that mean? Cross reference the dates. He said "next Thursday" which meant 8th May, and that was the day of the incident. Tsim Sha Tsui, during office hours. So the security manager was under orders to orchestrate the cash spill incident. Sis, aren't I awesome? I've never felt so useful before in my life. Who's the other person? I've checked the phone number. It belongs to Wong Sai Tou, a businessman who owns a company called Omnipotent Technology Holdings. But there isn't much business going on there except for stock and share speculations. Omnipotent? Why would they do that? If we knew, we wouldn't be called nerds, Madam. OK, we'll follow up on it. By the way, where did you intend to go with your luggage? I'm planning to donate some old clothes. Old clothes? Would any of them fit me? If only this was just a dream and my parents were still alive. Some wounds won't heal though it looks fine. Put the money down. Don't do anything that you'll regret. Finally, I'll be called Madam tomorrow! I made the cut! I'll be a good policewoman. Sis, let's change the money into yuan soon. You don't know how much they know or whether anybody's following you. But we'll be in trouble if Jun recalls that that's the name of my company. They're tapping into people's phones. Why don't we call the police? The police will hear that recording then. Sis, there's someone we can make use of. Who? We can go upstairs now. Hi. Kit isn't here. What can I do for you? Well, actually, I find you really awesome. I'd like to know how you dox someone. It requires some professional knowledge. —Can you teach me? —Do you have any drinks? You're a police officer. You can find out where the drinks are. I'd love to have some coffee. —I'll go make some for you. —Thank you. Here comes the coffee. Thank you. —I'm sorry. —Darn, my Hatsune Miku. I'm sorry. Why don't you go clean it up? I'm sorry... —I'm really sorry. —Password? When's your birthday? 23rd August. Why are you asking? I see. I just want to know your Chinese zodiac sign or rather, your horoscope. I'm a Virgo, I'm a perfectionist. Can you cope? Let me help you. Don't try to get fresh with me. I've a girlfriend. Really? You've a girlfriend? You're good friends with Jun, so don't mess around. Jun's your girlfriend? That's how I feel. I like a girl with meat on her bones. So you're not my type. All right, I got it. You're a girl. Don't get so touchy-feely. —People will start gossiping. —I got it. The boss of Omnipotent Holdings is... What the hell? Why is it so dirty? I didn't expect you to get so worked up. The boss of Omnipotent is the mastermind. Why are you sitting at my desk? Why are you messing with my things? What are these? They're not mine, they're Kit's. Give them to me. You don't have them. I've something on. I got to go. All right, I'll be in touch. Call me. I've done the math. I've kept a record of all the people caught picking up the cash on camera. Each stack contained HK$500,000 and in total, about 10 to 12 million dollars were shown being taken away on camera. The police reported losses of HK$22 million. In other words, about HK$10 million has disappeared without a trace. All online videos were shot in the crowd. What if the cash was taken before anyone noticed? No way, every street lamp comes with a CCTV. Anyone taking away HK$10 million would've been captured on camera and arrested long ago. These three boxes fell under the bridge. Unless the person picked up the money and teleported himself away, he would've been caught on camera after walking out from under the bridge. This truck stopped there that day. These trucks usually have dashcams. It's that truck. You got to be kidding me. It's OK. Some people even believe in changing their luck through sex. But it's illegal to pose as police officers. Buddy, aim higher for once. Come on. —Hey. —Hey. What's the matter? —CID. —Interpol. I got it. I'll leave immediately. Don't leave yet. —He has a question for you. —Yes. Was your truck parked over here during the cash spill incident last week? Last week? Yes. Let me see your dashcam. The one at the front or the back, Officers? Which one would've captured the scene? The one at the back. You got your answer then. Officers, please take a look. You can check it out. Are you still schooling? The boss of Omnipotent is the mastermind. My friend saw it on Facebook yesterday. She knows I work in this company, so she sent it to me. But I couldn't find it subsequently. Maybe it was deleted. Can you believe everything you see online? So I can just ignore it? Send me the screenshot. The boss of Omnipotent is the mastermind. It was you! It was you! Let's get out of here! —Our computers! —I've my phone. Let's go... Stop right there, rascals! That way... As I told you, running like Naruto would be faster. Fine, you're the best at everything. Hey... Back off or I'll throw this into the sea. Hey, what have you just done? I freaked out. Good job, smart kid. —Thank you. —Thank you. Let's go. Weren't you afraid? I know you don't like the police and neither do I. But we've to call the police. They attacked us on our turf. What if they decide to kill us? I don't want to. Stop forcing me. Think about it. Imagine how terrible our place is now. Hey. Are you guys OK? Jun, did you come here to see me? Look at how badly thrashed you guys are. But your spy vibes are awesome. Yes. But my computer and phone are gone. I haven't gone online for an hour. It's OK. I'll get you one of my old computers at home. Let's do crowdfunding on Golden Forum. —Jun, you're so nice to me. —Wait a second. So you've lost everything you worked on? Call the police now. Yes, you should convince him. He refuses to call the police. I can't. I don't want my dad to find out. Why must you keep your dad in the dark? Kwan Ching Kit! What are you guys up to? I'm doing this for justice, Dad. It's right to have a sense of justice. Good will always triumph over evil. But both of you got badly beaten up. Is this your idea of justice? So you want to be a hero? You must pay the price. Have you watched Batman? Can you bear the responsibility? Uncle, I know this sounds lame, but he's really doing this for justice. Uncle, we're really doing this for justice. Kit, I don't demand a lot from you. I just want you to be practical in life. It's that simple. Must everyone be practical in life? Shouldn't someone in our society uphold justice? And are you here to see me or tell me off? I'm here to tell you off? All right, Kit, listen up. If you still refuse to heed my advice, I'll wash my hands of you in future. You snitched on me? Let's not talk about this. Do we have to call it quits then? I must let him know that this is the right thing to do. I'm going to get a new computer tomorrow. All right... In loving memory of my wife, Yua Mikami So the money fell out of the armoured van as the driver wanted to dodge the minivan. How did you log into his Facebook account? I guessed the password. You could even guess his password? Most people use very simple passwords. Take him for example. His birthday's on 24th July and his English name's Joseph. So his password's joseph724. Scroll up... Is this your friend's Facebook account? I remember now. Ying works in Omnipotent Holdings. —Do the sisters like motorcycles? —Yes. It's such a coincidence the younger sister works in Wong Sai Tou's company. I've solved the case. She might've overheard Wong's conversation with Wan Chi Chung and found out that he bribed Wan Chi Chung to stage the cash spill accident. Before Q4S share prices plummeted in the UK, Wong had already short-sold his stocks and reaped a handsome profit. So the sisters followed the armoured van on their motorcycle and when the money fell out, they picked up two bags of it from under the bridge immediately. Next, the elder sister alighted nearby, changed her clothes and stepped forward to stop other people from taking the money. The person who stopped us that day is the one who got the biggest windfall. These are just unproven assumptions. Police officers will have each other's back. If a police officer has broken the law, she'll still be penalised. She must've had her difficulties to have resorted to that. Sis. Let's go the other way. Hey, it's time to repent. Turn yourselves in. You can still turn over a new leaf. We're just following orders. —Do it. —Yes, sir. Search thoroughly. —Yes, sir. —Yes, sir. Ghost, I can't open this cabinet. This is locked. —Have you tried opening it? —Yes. What's inside? Girls' stuff. Girls' stuff? Would you like a souvenir? —Let's go. —Yes, sir. Hey, where's your girlfriend? She doesn't want to betray a friend. None of the rest have shown up, let alone her. Are the girls not joining us? You can't rely on the girls for important matters. Enough about the girls. Is the intel solid? It's as solid as a rock. Let's think about it. If you were them, how'd you deal with it? I'd cross the border, change the money into yuan and then find a way to come back. If I had HK$10 million, I'd buy an island on Vanuatu and never come back. Crossing the border only takes an hour. Can't the police intercept them or notify the immigration department? The police are always one step behind us. Are we, the Keyboard Warriors, that lousy? We must stop her from making more mistakes. The moment I stepped out of this door, I told myself that regardless of the outcome, I must take every step for myself. The cash spill case has been solved. Two women are on the run with the loot. We aren't even wanted by the police, but our photos are already on Golden Forum. They're launching a cyber manhunt. Hey... calm down. Let's split up. Everyone, these two sisters are suspected to have bagged the biggest loot. We believe that they're already on the run. Please help to track them down. These Hong Kong women reflect badly on us. The elder sister has long legs. I stay at Sheung Shui. I can check it out. I think I saw the younger sis at Tuen Mun. Neither of them booked any flights. Maybe they're leaving by boat or on land. Here. There're a lot of replies. But it's all crap. There's no lead yet. We reckon they've a stash of HK$10 million which they're taking across the border now. If any of you happens to be near any control point at the border, please stop them. I hope we can help each other. If you're able to join this operation, please leave a comment. Does the elder sis resemble Yoshizawa Akiho? I'll execute them on the spot if I see them. I think I saw the younger sis at Tuen Mun. Yes, I think I saw the younger sis too. Someone saw the younger sister at Tuen Mun. Brother, can you follow the younger sister? I'm on my way there. I'm going to follow them. Who's joining? We're just the Keyboard Warriors, not the paparazzi. I'll be the back-up. Aren't you curious about the situation? You're useless. Wretched nerd! Where are you? If you aren't coming, I'm leaving. I've done my part already. Wait a while more. We're almost there! Hurry! Hey, the elder sister's here too! Weren't you afraid that you'd be spotted? —Has the boat arrived? —Not yet. Here comes the boat. Are you William Chan Carpark? Yes, are you Tin Shui Wai's Chan Ho Nam? —Yes. —Are you sure it's them? —I'm sure. —Help us call the police then. —I'll go look for them. —OK. Be careful. It's those two guys again. Let's hide. There's a boat. Do you think they're trying to skip town? Keep an eye on the boat. I'll look for them. Hey, you won't be able to escape. We've called the police. We got you this time. —Calm down. —Beat it! Why must we leave? We're not the criminals. That's because she has a gun. Let's go... I'll shoot you if you don't leave. Fine, shoot me. I don't believe you'll pull the trigger. Stop trying to be a hero. Just leave. You're a police officer. Do you remember why you became one? It's none of your business. We're just law-abiding citizens trying to stop a crime. Back then, you told us not to break the law. But you're breaking the law knowingly now. Fine, just shoot both of us. Otherwise, I won't let you leave. Don't get me killed. If you kill him, you can't escape either. Stop bothering us. Sis, let's go. Shut up! It's your fault that we ended up like this. If it weren't for you, I'd still be a good police officer. If it weren't for you, I'd be married with kids now. I don't have a sister like you. Scram! Scram! You scram too! All of you, scram! Scram! I took the money away. I orchestrated everything. Sis. I'm sorry. Mr Wong Sai Tou. What's the matter? You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. Is that clear? Boss, shall I contact your lawyer? Are you sure the arrest is warranted? You'll know after you come with us. Vincent Chan's waiting for you. Arrest all of them! —Come on, let's go. —Move it. Actually, what's the secret to retrieving the lost banknotes so quickly? Do you know I'm the leader of this team? They were very scattered at first, but I got all of them to work together. I was in charge of providing professional legal advice so they wouldn't break the law while doxing. It's my turn... It's outrageous that the police never gave us any reward after we helped them retrieve so much money. We hack... no, we never do any hacking. We just launch cyber manhunts. It's about getting together to see if we know someone. We don't spend all our time on the internet. Many of us care about society and we've a sense of justice. That's why we got involved in this case. Brother Tai, your son's impressive. The police cracked the case thanks to him. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I've been inculcating a sense of justice in my son. You were calling him useless a while back. It was just a casual remark. I didn't want to toot my own horn. I like catching people by surprise like making you guys think I'd given up when I've a winning combination of Thirteen Orphans. It's a self-drawn victory. Everybody, please pay up, thank you. Doxing isn't right. We need to respect people's privacy. Those who are doxed must've been crooks. Otherwise, why'd anyone bother to dox them? Doxing's good. They should dox all rascals who haven't been brought to justice. The Golden Forum kids? They shoot their mouths off, but they're knowledgeable and good-looking just like me. The Golden Forum kids? They've got nothing better to do. Lam Cho Shun, I'm going to beat you up. Golden Forum? Isn't the company acquired by Mr Siu? I used to do a lot of derivative work, pranking and doxing. —It was exciting. —Don't get me started. Doxing got me into trouble twice. —What are you filming? —Stop it. —Ignore him. —I got into trouble twice. They were the ones who got me in trouble! They might be nosy but they do good deeds sometimes. Isn't that right? Hey... I heard that you're great at doxing. Can you help me dox the Russian guy responsible for this? Doxing? I don't know what those kids are up to. But if they can help the police solve cases, it's a righteous act. I like it.
