Claire. Come to me, my child. Claire. Yeah, that's it. Ah, yeah. Wake up! Wake up, Paul! Wake up! - Come on. - I'm up, I'm up, I'm up... I was up all night and I had a revelation. - You did? What is it? - Yeah. We aren't going anywhere. - We're not? - No. - We're not? - No, because we're in LA. It's like the land of, of movie stars and fancy cars, you know? There's like five places alone on this block where you can get kombucha. What's that? What is kombucha? I don't even know. A-and that's my point. You know, 'cause if we're gonna be LA-ians, we-we gotta, we gotta adapt, right? Yeah, yes, yes, I do know, what you, like a, mm, like an adaptation. Yes, and we-we're, we're not just gonna run away because some idiots wanna spill their guts in our bathtub. No, no. This is our dream, this is our destiny. Yes, I don't wanna run, Claire. I'm, I'm... Like you always say, I'm lazy. We are strong and we are, we are adaptable and we are, we are Los Angelenos. Oh, gosh, dang it. I love you. - I love you. - I love you, too. I love you, Claire. - Let me go back to bed, though. - Oh, no. Claire, this meeting started 15 minutes ago. I am so sorry, some guy broke into our apartment last night and then committed suicide in the bathtub. I-I think he was like, part of some cult. The cult of Storsh. You're living in the Tabula Building? Why? Great location, it's close to freeways. Moving on. Meegan Nordheim. You all know her, star of the reality show Meal Ticket, stands to inherit half a billion dollars from insecticide king, Armund Nordheim, who is currently 96 years old and counting. And she is now running for congress because that's a thing now. The woman's a monster. Yeah. She wants an increase in kill shelters. I mean, who campaigns on killing puppies? She's retained us at the rate of 50,000 a month. - She has my full support. - Our country needs her. Yeah, well, she was up in the polls as of last night, but all that's gonna change because this morning the Los Angeles Tatler ran this series of paparazzi photos showing Ms. Nordheim enjoying the company of 20-year-old personal trainer slash actor, Dake Wharton. - Oh, my God. - Is that a squash? Look, this one's easy. It's a classic redirect. She repents, goes to church every Sunday, does a couple of guest sermons, talks about rebirth through God. Somethin' there. Tony. I mean, I say, we blame the dude. Nordheim was manipulated by some Hollywood pretty boy who preys on middle-aged women in order to extort money for sex. Okay, she is the victim here. - Claire? - Uh... Um... When I was in eight grade Ben Barnes, he drew private parts on my notebook, but I-I put stickers over top of them and I turned them into unicorn. I actually still have it, it's kinda cool. Moving on. - Do you yield? - No. W-wh-what's your book? I'm not, I'm not part of this. You're not here to use the bathtub? No, well, I mean, I use the bathtub. - It's my apartment. - You live here? That's, that's disgusting. This is our house. Me and Claire. Get out, get out. Oh, hello, Barry. Danielle, you're looking well. Please spare me the pleasantries. Do you yield? I do not! - What's your book? - The honorable Robert Perkins. The book of the honorable Robert Perkins. I choose verse 60! "Despite having shown no remorse for these brutal and cold-blooded murders, it is my regret that the state must refile these charges due to improper warrant for the search and seizure of evidence relating to the murder of Ms. Elizabeth Watson!" - Watkins! - No! Watkins! It's kins! Dammit! Who knows the book? I know the book, Barry! I can tell you this. This is not over. Now that is how it's done. What w-was that? The challenge, and next talent. What I Did Over Spring Break by Danielle Carter. "This summer, my mom and step-dad took us all to Denmark. We went to Legoland and it was really cool. There was a giant dragon made from Legos and they serve vanilla pudding in the cafeteria. My favorite thing about Legoland was the hotel. The bed was made from giant Legos and, uh, they serve pancakes for breakfast. In conclusion, Legoland is a very good place to go for your spring vacation. I recommend it highly for friends and family alike." That's great, that's, seriously, that's a, that's a really nice piece of writing. Oh, I did... I got an A on it. - Did you? Oh. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, well. Time for me to achieve eternal bliss. Oh, shit! I forgot my knife. Do you have a knife? - A knife to kill yourself with? - Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm not gonna, I don't want your blood and guts all over one of my knives. That's gross. That's what dishwashers are for. Then I'm gonna think about what you did with it every time I use it. Well, just put it in amongst all the other knives and then you wouldn't even remember. Then I-I'm gonna think about that with all my knives. Well, th-throw it away then. So now I'm giving you a knife? No. Is there anything else I can provide you with? Maybe like a spoon to scoop your eyeballs out or maybe a cheese grater to shave off your nipples? Jesus! I don't appreciate this kind of talk. Well, I don't appreciate a complete stranger doing a suicide in my bathtub. Ah! We haven't unpacked the knives yet. But you do have a screwdriver! No! No! Stop it! Claire! Help! Help me! - Oh, God! - Oh! - Oh, God. - Oh! What the fudge? You stabbed me! Oh, my God! - Oh, right in the spine. - Oh, my God! Why did you shove her like that? - She was attacking you! - No, she was... She was trying to kill herself! She's a cult member. Stop screaming! Ah! So loud! Stop screaming! - Oh, God. - Ah! He's never gonna believe us. - Who? - Th-that Detective Cartwright. - He's never gonna believe us. - Why? - Why wouldn't he believe us? - Uh... - Uh, look around. - I mean... The screwdriver in her back and there's blood on the wall and... - Oh, my God! You're right! - Oh, God! You're right! What, what are we gonna do? - Tell us what to do, Claire! - I don't know. - Tell us what to do! - I don't know! Just let me think, let me think, let me think, please. Change the story. This is how we found her. Yeah, she totally committed self-murder in the bathtub. She stabbed herself in the back? I know. Right? This is the sloppiest tub death I've ever seen. Yeah, 'cause how many times do you get to practice your own suicide? Yes, that's actually a good point. - 'Cause he gets, he gets... - Just in one shot. Yeah. Here comes Wallace on the comedy bus five minutes late. That's how humor works. It's an involuntary reaction when you find something funny. You can't fake it after you hear two people laughing, you child. You've been unpacking. You kids planning on staying? Yeah, uh, you know, it's a great location, it's close to freeways. Really? Y-you know, that really shows some backbone. To be honest, a lot of the people just leave right away. That's good. Y-you're gonna like it. There is a, um... There is a nice pizza place about three blocks up called Schneider's and they have a two-for-one deal where you get a can of Pepsi for free on weekdays. I don't know if you guys, uh, like pizza. Everybody does. - O-oh. - Oh, you... Yeah, I... Well, we... I have to, I have to work. I don't know why you're telling me that. I have work, too. Everyone has work. That's... Uh, why are you telling me you have work? - Is it non sequitur? - Oh, no, I didn't mean... 'Cause I wasn't asking you guys to hang out with me. - I'm a police officer. - Oh, of course. I'm a detective. I, I work. Oh, no, I didn't mean... The job's frankly all I got. It's, uh... Which is probably why I caught Storsh. He did not get away from me. He got away from a department with its head up its ass. I was not the one asleep at the switch. You know, this Storsh character, i-it's like, a lot of the stuff in this book makes sense. You know, I mean, some of it's crazy, obviously, but some of it isn't. Like, okay, for example... One of the things is being the best you you can be. Well, I don't see anything wrong with being the best you I can be. No, the best you you can be. That's what I said. Okay. Um... For example, here's another really good one. Uh... Oh, here. Listen to this. "When one liberates oneself from the shackles of overthought, life can truly be free. Open yourself to your inner will and close the door on the addiction to outside approval." I mean, this is me at work. I totally relate to this. Like, I'm always worried about what other people are thinking. I don't even know what I'm thinking. This stuff really makes sense. You know, I'm not smart like you are, Claire. Oh, Paul. But I don't have to be smart because I've got you. And-and now that we're casting off the shackles of overthought, I swear my most deepest swear that I'm gonna get a job, like, as soon as possible. New city, new Paul, new us. Oh, Paul. - I believe in you. - Oh. - I believe in you. - Yeah? Oh, I love you, my Claire. Claire, Claire, hi. So we just got the call. Nordheim is coming in to see what we have for the campaign. - Now? - Yeah, now. Ah. We weren't expecting Mr. Nordheim. Oh... Well, we were thinking, what if you were to repent. The religious angle. - You find Jesus. - I'm Jewish. Obviously you did a workup on me and you already know that. Okay. We put a story in the paper that the young man with whom you had relations is actually a con artist preying on... Preying on? Praying... Tony, why don't you take this one since it's your idea? Sure. Uh... Um, uh... I see sort of like a, uh, a basketball player, but instead of legs, um, it's got tang threads. So, like a ro... Ro... Okay, I'm gonna speak now. I am not impressed with any of this. And if this is all you have, I'm going to be very, very, very disappointed. I have an idea. What exactly would you say your strengths are? Well, uh, first and foremost, I am a people-pleaser. - Pe-people like me. - Well, I don't like you. And I have a hard time seeing how anyone would. Please, just, sir, just give me a chance. Do you even know what it is we do here? Y-y-you guys design roller coasters, right? Well, you managed to get that right. How many years of mechanical engineering do you have? No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Listen. Listen, I really need this job. My girlfriend said that I-I have to get my job thing sorted or we can never get married. - Uh! Your girlfriend? - Yeah. You're in here wasting my time because of your girlfriend? - No, no, please... - I'm shocked... You even have a girlfriend. I wouldn't be surprised if she leaves you by the end of the week because there is no job for you here or anywhere in this city. - No... - Now get out of my office! Hi, Paul. Why so glumy, chummy? I can't get a job. No one will hire me. Uh, not after what happened in Ohio. What's the what in Ohio, huh? Okay. Did you know that in 33% of marriages somebody commits infidelity? And that's only the ones who admitted, so... So you were caught having a little fun on the side. I'm sure every woman in America would understand if you just put it into context. Yeah. What context is that? Let's break the shackles of approval and show everyone it's okay to be the real you. I made this thing. It's a... Really, a-all you need to do is show these, these two pictures side-by-side and then simply ask... "Come on. Wouldn't you?" "Come on. Wouldn't you?" Come on. Wouldn't you? Come on. Wouldn't you? I mean... Come on. Come on! Come on. Wouldn't you? - Come on. Wouldn't you? - Come on. Wouldn't you? - Come on. Wouldn't you? - Come on. Wouldn't you? - Come on. Wouldn't you? - Come on. Wouldn't you? ♪ Come on wouldn't you? Hey ♪ ♪ Come on wouldn't you? Hey ♪ ♪ Come on wouldn't you? Oh yeah ♪ ♪ Come on wouldn't you? Everybody ♪ ♪ Come on wouldn't you? Oh ♪ ♪ Come on wouldn't you? Hey... ♪ Pearl, where have you been hiding this girl? I love her! ♪ Oh come on wouldn't you? Hey ♪ This one time last year... I stayed up really late to watch The Storage Wars marathon. It's a really awesome show because I like stuff about storage units. Anyway, I was gonna go to bed, but then I remembered that Claire had asked me to do the laundry, so I stayed up for the rest of the night and did the laundry. Um, but then, then, the-the dryer didn't finish in time, and I had to go to my job at the water filtration plant. And so I just wore my uniform damp. But then on my walk to work, um, I got really, really cold. And I couldn't stop shivering, so I stopped at the gas station and got a Mountain Dew. And when I got to work, I tried to heat the Mountain, Mountain Dew up on a hot plate. But then the plastic melted and-and, and then the melted plastic and the Mountain Dew got all over my hands and I knocked over a can of turpentine and that mixed with some oldie peanuts and then that dripped into the filtration fluids. And then the, the melty Mountain-Dewie plastic and the, and the mold and the turpentine all mixed together and made some w-weird chemical reaction and-and then that... that got into the town's water supply. And the entire town lost their hair. All their hair. Their arms and their legs and their eyebrows. And then... and then about half the town, let's say, about 80,000 people, got rage madness and they started foaming at the mouth and attacking each other for no reason. And then the whole town became a war zone. And we had to stay inside, but everybody got so hungry. But then the rage people stole all the food and they, they hid it in a used tire yard. And they built this massive fort out of used tires. It was like a beehive, and then they stayed in, in the tire hive and they wouldn't come out. And so then all the then the normal people burned down the tire hive. But then the fire, the fire burned for months because it was just millions of used tires. And then we all had to go to the woods and hunt for animals. But it was the summer and, and it was so hot and we all took off all of our, our clothes and then we ran out of bullets. And so there's just a bunch of hairless naked people running around the woods, hunting for deer and raccoons and squirrels with our bare hands. And then, t-then everyone got really hungry again 'cause we ran out of animals. And then... then you couldn't tell the normal people from the rage people and-and you couldn't tell who was who. And then a militia came from another state and they called us all s-skinners and th-they hunted us for sport. And then the National Guard came to fight the militia and then the government sent in the army to rescue us all and then when it was all done... they told me I couldn't go back to Ohio anymore. Oh, Paul. Sounds like you've been on quite the journey. But your true journey of bliss found on the instantaneous eternity only begins when you change your story. It's time to loose the Os in Ohio and say hi to the new Paul, a Paul who's his own boss, a Paul who answers to Paul. To-to me? It's like the Book Of Stories says. The only thing you've to worry about is what you think. If there's no job for you, make your own job. Be like me. Be free. Free like a bird, bird. Free? Like a bird, bird? Like a bird, bird. Yeah. Hey-hey! - Hey! - I had the best day. Me, too. I had, I have huge news. Oh, okay. You first. So I-I slammed the door on the jackals of over-thoughts. Just like you said, I've been so worried about what everyone else thinks I should be that I forgot what I want to be. Oh, well, that-that's amazing. What do you wanna be, Paul? A bird housemaker. I make birdhouses now. Come, come, come. Oh, wow! You, you made all of these? Yeah, I'm in the zone. Look, so this one's a little pool house, right? And it's got a little lounge chair, a little changing room where the birds can change out of their red clothes. A simple mother-daughter apartment for when mom gets really old and she could die, she could die at any moment. There's a little mechanical chair that goes up and down the stairs. This one is modelled after Chuck E. Cheese, but I call it Chick E. Cheese. And there's a little bosspit. And there's a fake band and then this one is a honeymoon suite, it's got a, um, a heart-shaped bed for getting it on. Oh, look. Claire, I almost forgot. This one's for you. It's an exact replica scale of the Full House living room, season one. Paul, this is, this is amazing! You don't have to say that. No, Paul. No. I-I'm really proud of you. - Mm. - Thank you. - Tell me about your day! - Oh... I can't believe. I've been so focused on, I... What about your day? Take the mic. Okay. - Is it on? Okay. - You... Um, so, yeah, we had this, the surprise visit from a client at work and everyone was, like, stressed out and losing their minds, but I kept my cool and I saved the day with a stunning pitch when everyone else had nothing. - And Pearl even shook my hand. - That hand? - Yeah! - All right! I knew you could do it! You know, and I-I just applied the teachings of Storsh and it actually worked. - Oh, my God. I love Storsh. - Yeah, I know. Me, too. I'm so jacked up right now, I can sell anything. - Well, sell me a birdhouse. - How about a pun? Like, uh, Paul's birdhouse, when nature Pauls. That's brilliant! Okay, here's another... Uh, uh... This birdhouse will never Paul out of a tree. You gotta slow down. I gotta write this down. Seriously. I... Oh, no, no. Don't even sweat it. I got a million of 'em. Okay, how about this one? Uh, uh, Paul's Boyd... Paul Boyd's birdie birdhouse building. - Ah! You know what your name is? - What? - Little Ms. Ideas. Yes. - No. - You're amazing. - No, you're amazing. - We're amazing. - Yeah. You know what this means, Claire? We're finally getting our stuff sorted. Yeah. It was the '90s, a different time, a simpler time. When a man committed a crime, you kicked in the door and worried about paperwork later. But like all good times, that time was a time whose time has come to an end. Then on April 2nd, 1997, I came face-to-face with pure evil. Reginald Euclid Storsh, incited over two dozen innocent victims to self-murder. An adversary so brilliant, so cunning that to merely be in his presence was to risk total mental and spiritual annihilation. "Detective Cartwright, did you have a warrant for these proceedings?" "A warrant? Hell, no, Your Honor, he's guilty." "Well, I don't care how ridiculous or stupid or unfair it is, I declare a mistrial. Case dismissed." "Your Honor, no!" So I made my life's goal up to not give him a moment's rest. I dogged him like a dog. But six months into it, he committed suicide in a bath tub. Then his followers started committing suicide in the same tub. Cultist after cultist dove into a porcelain nightmare of blood and death. The chief still has the case open. And guess who has to clean up every time one of these morons commits a see-pa-coo in the tub? That's right. Me. Cartwright. The last good cop. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go. - Hey. - Mm! Oh... Oh, come on, man! - What? - I booked the tub! It's been on the schedule for months. Okay. Just do it. Three-way challenge. Do you yield? I-I, I don't, I don't know. Do we? The invocation. "In order to get to instantaneous eternity, you must pass through the gateway chosen by the Holy Storsh." What? Oh, my God! You're initiates, aren't you? Uh, initiates. Yeah. Actually, do you, do you think you could teach us some initiate stuff? Well, maybe I'll break the rules this one time. - Awesome. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, um, you know, you two guys really lucked out. It's not every day that two initiates get taught their invocation by a level-six instructor. - Level six? - Yeah. Is that, uh, is that a good level? Uh, there's only 11 levels and I'm level six, which is basically level seven, so really I'm an eight. So, yeah, I'd say it's pretty damn good. And I specialize in invocation training. You could say I'm kind of a big deal down at East Side Bethel, you know? - Huh. Mm! - Okay. - Uh, so lie down. - All right. Here. Okay. Like the... Uh, okay, um, scooch down towards me a little. Okay, now go left, uh, just a little bit. Okay. Actually, scooch back up just a couple of... Yeah, okay, that's good. And come over to your right. Okay, you're moving faster, so, so just... - Yeah. And then... - Me? Oh. Okay. You come down just a touch. Perfect. Actually, you know what? Go, go back a little bit. That's it. That's it! Nice. This guy is awesome. I mean, he's basically a level eight. I know. Okay. Now look up to the light. That's life. It's bright, it's inviting, it's warm. That's light. That's life. And this is death. What do you see? I-I can still see an outline. But it's fading. Exactly. See, normally when someone dies, there's a little bit of afterglow that lingers. But then unfortunately, it just disperses into the ether. But thanks to the great Storsh, his chosen will bask in the light of eternity. Just because the magical Storsh spilled his magical blood in that bath tub, the bath tub is magical and will magically hold on to the afterglow for all eternity. All of that in a bath tub? Would you like to bear witness to my exodus? Cyanide. It's quick. Painless. Well... I'm sorry, I didn't think I would get emotional. You know, you two are gonna be great followers. Hm. I'm gonna tell Storsh about you when I get to the other side. That's neat. Yeah. Bye. It's just a sec. Any second. - Oh! Oh! Ow! Whoa! - Oh... Whoa, wait, hey, this actually hurts quite a bit. - Oh, Go... Oh, no! - Ah! Oh, God! Oh! Oh, actually, this hurts quite a lot actually! - Do you want some water? - Oh, for the love of Christ! They're inside of my body, burning like a thousand suns! - No! Oh, no! - I'll go get a first-aid kit! No! You idiot! I wanna die! Kill me! - Kill me! - Just go! Oh, my God! Use this! Use this! - Me? - Yes! Oh! Oh! I am sorry! What kind of cheap knife is that? - We're on a budget, okay? - No! Stab harder! Do it! - Come on! - No! Oh! Claire, stop it! Stop! Claire, no! We need better killing! Oh, God! You can't kill me with that stapler! - Oh, God! Aah! - Oh! You have no idea how much this hurts! Plug it in! Why won't you die? I gotta get 'em out! Oh! Is there something you wanna tell me, Claire? Uh, no, I-I don't think so. You're sure about that? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I get why you would, but it's not a good idea to lie to a detective, it's... I detect. I get to the bottom of things. It's my job. And your job is, you work in the business. - The business? - Yeah. The ad business? I found out. You work at Global Creative. Okay, come on. I-I... Let me wet my beak. Do you understand how you could help a person in my situation? Just... Oh, hey! Is this your screenplay? Cool! I didn't exactly pick a title yet, but... Well, what exactly do you want me to do with this? Well, do what you do. Talk to people. You must know actors, right? D-do you know Wesley Snipes? He's who I always picture when I'm writing about myself. Uh, he needs this. Yeah. Totally. I... You know, I'll make some calls. - You're not just saying that? - No. I had a feeling about you two. First two aside. You know? I know I can count on my new friends. And sorry about this all. Well, I'll mark it down as the usual... And give me feedback. Give me notes. I-I'm not precious, I collaborate. ♪ Girl you know ♪♪ Uh... You know, I've been thinking. When those guys first showed up and were gonna kill themselves in our bath tub, I was like, "Okay, t-this is crazy." And then when, you know, the more we learned about Storsh, I can see why these people follow him. You know, I mean, sure, it's not for everybody, but think about what good he's done for us and we're not even in his cult. Well, w-we can't be in a cult. We're from Ohio. Yeah, but, you know, when you think about it, all religions have good and bad. So, like, maybe we can just take the good from Storsh and, like, apply it to our own lives. Like, you know, the other day when you burned your finger on the glue gun, and you're like, "Oh, Jesus H. Christ," but, like, you're not even a Christian. No, you listen, I'm totally good with having a little Storsh in our lives, I mean, it means a little more blood and violence, no biggie. But that's my point, you know, these poor souls work so hard to meet Storsh in the instantaneous eternity, but they really have trouble with the-the, like, the final commitment, you know? It's like Cartwright said, "How many chances do you have to practice your own suicide?" - They totally suck at suicide. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So this is what I'm thinking. You know, it's our apartment, so what's, what's wrong with helping our visitors with a quick, clean transition into the instantaneous eternity? Helping our visitors is the least we can do. It is the least we can do. This is our home. This is our temple. It's the reason we left Ohio. To serve the good word of Storsh. Reginald E. Storsh, Claire.

Stone, Wallace, get rid of this chump. - So, uh, Claire? - Yeah? Any luck with Wesley? - I'm sorry? - My script? Wesley Snipes? Oh! Yeah. Uh, actually, yeah. I, uh, called, I called his agent and Fred, uh, Fred Burm-Burm, Fred Burminton, and he said, uh, that he was gonna give it to Wesley and that he was gonna take a look at it. You're lying. - No. - You gotta be lying! He said those words? Fred Burminton said that? Uh, yeah, absolutely. He... - You, I told you about... - She told... I... He, he definitely did. Well, here we go! - Yeah. - This is it! Oh, uh, uh, tell him, uh, I'm gonna take the thing about the super soldiers out. Uh, my sister's boyfriend is a bloom operator on General Hospital and he said, um, that that technically makes it sci-fi, which is an issue in Germany, uh, and I wanted this to play internationally. I can't believe I just said that. Okay, so then, no super soldiers. Got it. Claire, you are amazing. - Oh, oh... - Oh... Thank you. - Oh, that's... Tha-that happens. - Hey... Claire. Ms. Nordheim. What are you doing here? I just came from a fundraising dinner. We made a record raise. You managed to turn my whole campaign around, Claire. I wanted to thank you. Oh. Wow, that is so sweet of you. I'm gonna have to start drinking wine. Well, well, well. What a beauty. I am impressed, Claire. Is it yours? Oh. Yeah, the birdhouse? My, uh, my boyfriend makes 'em. Hm. Well. I'll tell you what, Claire. I am in the market of furry birdhouse. I would love to meet the artist. Oh, I'm-I'm sure Paul would be thrilled. I-I would, I'd be happy to make the connection for you. I... We'll have to do that sometime. How about now? Oh, uh... We're still moving in, so... Can I, uh, offer you anything? - Are these the birdhouses? - Oh, yeah, th-those are them. Where's the boyfriend? He around? He must be out, which is... You know, and he pretty much never goes out, so it's kinda weird. - I'm gonna paint one of those. - Oh. I've always wanted to dive head first into the arts. Hm. I like you, Claire. Frankly, I see myself in you. And I'm sure my upbringing wasn't that different from you other than, you know... I look like this. And I realized pretty quickly, that as a woman, you have tremendous power. Have you ever felt the kind of power that I'm talking about, Claire? Oh, you know, o-once I played the Powerball and I won five dollars. Yeah, that was pretty cool. So I figured if these men are gonna have their way with me, then I'm gonna have my way with them. Armund was 82 when I married him. Today he is 96. Turns out, the old guy is built like a machine. And he just keeps going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going! Point is, Claire, this young boyfriend of yours who builds birdhouses, I am sure he's just peachy. But you have got to take the power that is rightfully yours. You've got to milk this world for everything that it has to give. You know, t-that must be Paul. Oh. Oh, my gosh. Mr. Nordheim! Did-did you climb up all of those stairs? Are you okay? Here. D-does he need, like, a defibrillator o-or something? Uh, should I get him some water? He's already had his water today. Claire, let him go. Claire, he's fine. What I am trying to tell you is that I have come here to liberate you from the prison that you call love. And, yes, it will be painful at first, but eventually you're gonna thank me. And I can't say that I'm not going to enjoy liberating you by liberating Paul the way I liberated that boy in the gym over and over and over and over... Oh, my God! Oh, oh... Oh, my God! Ho! I'll go get the first-aid kit. Oh, I'm free. I'm free. I am free. I am finally free! Oh, my God. I'm finally free. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, God, thank you. I so deserved this. Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you... - Paul. - Oh, my gosh! You're Meegan Nordheim. Paul, I want you to liberate me. Liberate me now. - Uh, is Claire home? - Forget Claire! There is no Claire. There is only you and there is me. - Okay. I'll get the juice. - No, no, no... Paul, come to me. Paul, I want my bliss now. Please don't make me wait for it. Don't make me wait, Paul. Please, please, please, I want my bliss. Please, Paul, Paul... Paul, please, now. - Oh... Okay, o-okay, okay. - Okay. Oh, no. Paul, what did you do? - I saved her. - What? Why? She was a visitor. You said that we had to help them. No... Children of Storsh. Well, how was I supposed to know that? It's called logic, Paul! - Oh, shoot! - My God! Oh, no, no, no, no. You let her paint the country house? I'd hardly call that a country house. No, no, no, no, no. Country house, Boyd house, complete with a little front-porch swing and a bird-watching tower for watching birds. Looks more like a fire station. What kind of fire station has a porch swing? Forget about the birdhouse, Paul. We gotta deal with this now, okay? No, no, no. She's-she's... It's gonna be fine. I mean, she's still alive. Everything's, everything's okay. She's gonna tell everyone what you did and you're gonna go to jail! How can you be so stupid? Paul! I'm sorry, Ms. Nordheim. Not the fire station. It's a country house. Cartwright's on his way. What are you gonna tell him? A story. A love story about a woman who married a man for all of the right reasons, and not for his money and-and not for his power, but because she saw who he really was. A man who needed her more than she needed him. It started out as a pure kind of love, but it quickly became something else. An obligation, not for her, but for him. For her it was never a romantic kind of love. It was a friend kind of love. She knew that if she left him, it would destroy him. So she stayed by his side and hoped that he would realize that he bet on the wrong horse. But he never did. So she was trapped... until she found Storsh. What she never found in her marriage, she found in the open arms of Storsh and his followers, seekers of the instantaneous eternity, that one brief moment of bliss that can go on for forever. Armund was so distraught, so devastated by the loss of his one true love that he sought to follow her. He'd rather die in her arms than live without her for one more day. Wow. Gosh, darn it, Claire. I have to say something to you right now. You-you know what? We had a problem, right? And what do we do? - We sorted it. - Uh-huh. This problem is sorted. It's sorted. And it's not just this problem, it's everything, our... The-the apartment, your job, my job. We... we are, are sorted. What are you doing? Listen... Claire Annabelle McKenty, will you, will you marry me? Y-you're doing this right now? No, I know, I know I said I wouldn't ask again until we got our-our stuff figured out. But guess what? We did! We did! I wanna be with you forever, Claire. I want... I need you to marry me. - Oh, well, okay... - Okay. We need to do the thing... right now. ♪ Do you like me?

D-did we get any visitors? Oh, no. No, it's been pretty quiet. Y-you know, I was thinking, maybe we could go for a walk in the neighborhood and then when we get back, we could play some shrabes. I was kinda hoping for like a Storshy kind of evening. So... Go for Cartwright. Detective, hey. It's Claire. Claire, got any news for me? News? Oh! Yeah! You know, I... Uh, I, uh, heard from Snipes and he loved the script, so... You're kidding. Are you kidding? No, I'm, I wouldn't, I wouldn't kid with you, Boyce-boy. Uh, uh, please hold one... Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, that's such a good news. Claire, this is huge. I should, I gotta put in notice with my captain, right? Because I can't work active cases if I'm gonna be on set. Is he gonna want a producer credit? 'Cause I... Between you and me, he doesn't deserve anything more than associate executive producer. Hey, uh, question for you. Anything, Claire, shoot. We haven't had a cult member in a while and I just wondered, like, is there some sort of, like, Storsh holiday that we're not aware of? Like a, like a suicide Yom Kippur? Oh, well, it hasn't been that long, it's three days ago. Oh, yeah, okay, cool, no, it just seems like there should've been one by now. Actually, uh, a few years ago, there was a dry spell that lasted six months. I mean, I thought it was over, but then it all started up again. Uh, eventually, Claire, they always come back. That's what you gotta understand about these people. If it helps, think of yourself as switching places with me narratively. You know, you're becoming kind of the lonely beat cop in the wasteland of death, I'm becoming the Hollywood screenwriter. Hey, Claire, do you think that a guy like me would be able to pen a romcom, a romantic comedy? I had this story, you know what they say, "Write what you know." My ex-wife, she went to Ireland o-once and she just never came back, and e-eventually we divorced through the mail and it was, it was kinda like a Lake House meets, um, Lady And The Tramp. Because we were really better friends through letters that when w-when we were sharing a bed. And then I eventually, you know, started talking to her new husband. Um, he's a firefighter. Uh, I mean, and Irish firefighter, you gotta... It's pretty cool. Like, like... As-as much as I don't wanna admit it, like, that's pretty much a manlier occupation. I mean, an the Irish already fight everything. This guy fights fire. Uh, I-I-I just thought, like, kind of a, like a triangle thing with like Matthew McConaughey, uh, Kate Hudson and maybe like Wesley Snipes. If he gets one on this one... Okay, so listen, Nordheim wasn't in the cult. - But we saved her anyway. - Well, she needed to be saved. - She wanted to kill puppies. - Exactly. So before we were saving people into the instantaneous eternity who wanted to be saved, but maybe we save people who need to be saved that don't even know they need to be saved. That's great, like murderers and rapists or celebrity chefs. Exactly. Okay. Let's do this. It's a, um, new anti-depressant. We have to sell people on getting happy because apparantly hopelessness and despair are currently trending. Mr. Carl, I've got this. The only way to achieve complete happiness is... by inviting the father and savior Storsh in to your heart. Now, I-I know, I know you're all looking at me like you're a little skeptical, but believe me, I was too, but, you know, you just, you just gotta go for it. So, I-I'd love for you guys to join. You know, just a bunch of like-minded people who wanna be as happy as they can be. That's all very interesting. And you've given us a lot to think about. Stupid legs, stupid legs. Stupid rigor-mortis legs! Oh! Fuck! Claire! Claire! Thanks God you're home. Something terrible has happened. They shut down my website. And my credit card was declined. I was just so busy making birdhouses that I forgot to pay and then the bank was so far that I didn't wanna walk and I spent all my money on skittles and wood and thanks God... Thanks God for you, Claire, thanks God for you. Can you swap me 200 bucks? They fired me, Paul! They fired me! We don't have jobs. We are unsorted, Paul! We're unsorted! What are we gonna do, Claire? What are we gonna do? I love you. I love you. Uh... Yeah? Claire Annabelle McKenty, you, will you marry me? No. I can't marry you. Hello, Claire, my child. - It's you. - It's me. I-I can't believe it. You-you came. They doubted you, but you came. Shh, quiet now. Let's not spoil it. I just can't believe it. You're actually, you're here i-in my tub. Remember the thing about not spoiling it that I just said six seconds ago? Oh, yeah. Yeah, sorry. I just... Well, y-your teachings have changed my life. - Mm-hmm. - It's just... Things aren't working now and I don't know, I don't know where I've gone wrong. Mm, tell you, when this whole thing started, I never thought it would spread further than my backyard. Just a bunch of crazy loons dancing in the light of the instantaneous eternity over nachos and Fanta. But soon the whole city became my backyard. The beacon of Storsh was lit and the people came. I know I did. I know you know you did. I was watching you from the afterlife. You know, the spiritual reward for saving souls was incredible. What a buzz! It's just like a tingle. But soon that wasn't enough. I needed to reach more of my children, I needed the message to find the masses and save the souls of the entire world like, on a God level. You know, I, I made a plan and that plan was I'd get caught and I'd become a media sensation. Live out my days in some cushy, white-collared prison like Bundy Romanson. TV specials, conjugal visits. So I let that cop catch me. You know this guy, you know who I'm talking about? - Cartwright? - Yeah. Naturally, he screwed it all up and I got off. But it turns out, getting away with it was like some major power move. Next thing, I'm this huge celebrity, people following me around, "Oh, Storsh, have my baby. Storsh, can I get a photo? Storsh, can I get a photo of you and me trying to make babies?" People offering me book deals, multiple book deals, like a three-book deal. In the grocery store, people offering me cupcakes, people... I mean, you name it. I had an assistant... for a little while. But then I realized, "Oh, my God. I could immortalize myself and forever spread the word of Storsh with the ultimate saving. Who? Me, myself." So I climbed in this bathtub here and I did my thing and in one fell swoop, I became the god I was destined to be. Oh, that is so beautiful. Yeah, I guess it is. But, you, Claire, you, my love. None of my followers have served me as greatly or lovingly as you. And yet, there is still one final lesson for you to learn. Oh, teach me. I-I want to learn. You've been so focused on saving everyone else, you've forgotten the most important person of all. I-I'm sorry, what? You've been so focused on saving everyone else, you've forgotten the most important person of all. I-I don't... You've forgotten the most important person of all. Oh... Oh. Yeah. I understand. I understand. The door to my bus is always open, Claire. Always open. Hey, Cartwright. I heard you're, uh, going off to make your movie. Yeah. Finally pulling it together. Oh. I'll see you at the premiere. Oh-ho... Ah, man, you're such a wiener. Oh, man. Hey. Hey. Still wanna go to Winnipeg? Not really. Yeah, me neither. And while you were in there talking to the bathtub, I did some thinking. Yeah? The reason you never really married me. I get it. You do? You love me. It's just not a romantic kind of love. It's a friend kind of love. Oh, Paul... I'm sorry. For what? That I'm not smart. What? No. No. You're the smartest guy I know. This is the sloppiest tub death I've ever seen. It's weird how they all have some kind of red dye on their lips now. Yeah, it's totally weird, right? Her elderly, physically-decrypted husband from whom she stands to inherit millions somehow gets his walker up the flight of stairs. That part's actually true. What is that? This one. That, that's the coffee shop where we had our first kiss. What's this? Uh, it's the pizza shop where I thought we had our first kiss. Oh. Apparently, I was mistaken. Yeah. What's this one? It's just a line. No, no, no. See. This is, this is your butt. Oh. Which I do like very much.

I can't seem to keep any tenants here for more than a couple of weeks. You know, what if I moved in and... Really? You wanna live here? It's cheap and, uh, very conveniently located. And...
