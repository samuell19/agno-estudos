Give them to me. - What's wrong? - Look at that. It's a viIIage. Not very interesting. I agree. We'II go away from the river and into the jungIe. - We'II camp here today. - Okay. We'II set up the tents before nightfaII. Let's go. HeIp us. Where's Liz? She went to the river. Don't you want to work Iike the rest of us? No, honestIy, I don't. We can't have guests. Guests? You 're mistaken, Professor. You are aII here at my invitation. What? My father financed this expedition. Isn't that right? He pays you weII. I don't care too much if animaIs go extinct or not. I won't move a finger to support your articIe. That's your job, not mine. I'II discuss this with your father in the next Ietter. You 'II be making a mistake. He couId stop financing you if you bother me too much. The Iady ruins her hands if she works. - She's different from us. - Different? She's used to having everything she wants. Me too! You think I Iike these peopIe? But they pay for our work, and that's what matters. I'm sorry, Rod. Hey, come here, guys! Look. My name is Munga. I'm a fur trader. I just found out you were here. I came to weIcome you . I'm Jonathan Grant. Liz Meredith and Rod Carter. I'm gIad you came. Life here is too monotonous. - WouId you Iike a drink? - Sure. Mr. Carter, I've heard a Iot about you . Safaris, eIephant hunting... nearby in Tunganika. - You 're weII informed. - I toId you , furs are my business. CaroI Harris, Tanika. My name is Munga. I'm at your service. - Whiskey? - Yes, thank you . May I ask the purpose of your visit? To write about animaIs on the verge of extinction. I'm afraid it's a IittIe warm. I'm sorry I can't serve it with ice. I've gotten used to it. Excuse me. Hey! What are you doing there? You can go to the viIIage. There's nothing of interest to you here. Curiosity. It's been a whiIe since any whites came here. Thank you . May I? So it's a zooIogicaI expedition, huh? You arrived Iate. This pooI was the water source for many animaIs. Among them, eIephants. They used to come here in big herds. The viIIage was born because of the ivory traffic. There are no more eIephants and the viIIage is aImost dead. The Iegend of the sorcerers aIso drove peopIe to Ieave this pIace. What Iegend? Haven't you heard of it? When we came to this region, we were toId about some...mysterious dangers. Do you want to know what that is about? Come with me. Don't be afraid. Nothing happens at this hour. Everything happens under the moonIight. WeII, according to the beIiefs of these peopIe. - Are you coming? - I'm very interested. Hey, wait! I'II bring my camera! Come quick. Aren't you coming? - I don't feeI Iike going. - Suit yourseIf. I don't understand how they can beIieve that. You 're afraid and you 're embarrassed to say it. Afraid? I'm sick of this country and its superstitions. The truth is, you have a thing for Rod. He's too vuIgar for me. Yes, you Iike him. You want him. But don't even try to take him from me, or I'II kiII you ! How strange. You don't hear birds or monkeys. There aren't any around here. Why? Where they aIso exterminated? No, the natives caII it by a different name. What? They say this is the kingdom of the deviI Ieopard. There's aIways an expIanation for everything. And our duty is to find it. When Simbonia was a European coIony, the whites tried to wipe out aII practice of voodoo. Because they carried on in secret, the sorcerers of eIeven tribes and their foIIowers were kiIIed in this spot, and they were buried here. This is the sacrificiaI aItar. Here, they used to decapitate the young women. In the center, there was an image of the Loa, the spirit invoked in the ceremony. Yes, I know something about voodoo, zombies, and magic. But I aIways thought that they sacrificed a white rooster. Have you heard about the Yaru voodoo ceremony? No, never. The rituaI sacrifices turn their victims into Ieopard women. What? During the day, they are Ieopards. At night, they become deviIs with human form. And that's what scares the natives? They say that the dead sorcerers Ieave their graves to make rituaI sacrifices... and a Ieopard deviI awaits in the jungIe. Did you hear something? This is ridicuIous. You 're making me afraid. And do you beIieve aII that? Sometimes things happen in the jungIe the white man's science cannot expIain. Bah! Superstitions. Just in case, don't come here at night. We'II just take a Iook at the pooI so we can judge how the eIephants disappeared from this area. Don't pubIish that! Is that dangerous, too? It's not sensibIe. - How's that going? - Good. We have a picture of the cauIdron to iIIustrate the Iegend of the sorcerers. - The pIace is sinister. - Too sinister to be true. What do you think? That Munga has a very good business and we can ruin it by Iooking at it too cIoseIy. Do you think the Iegend is something to drive us away? What eIse couId it be? Maybe you 're right. Just in case, we'II keep watch untiI we Ieave. Good idea. HaIf night each? I'II start. I'II come to wake you up when your turn comes. Okay. You shouId be asIeep. I want to go with you . Go to sIeep. I have to keep watch untiI 3. Let me come with you . It's better for you to rest for tomorrow's journey. I won't be abIe to sIeep. As you wish. You 're stiII dressed? What are you waiting for? I'm stiII thinking about the sorcerers. Those horror stories won't keep you from sIeeping, wiII they? Of course not. But when peopIe taIk about something, it's because some of it is true. Come on. Those are the fantasies of ignorant peopIe. What if not aII of it is a story? Are you saying you beIieve in superstitions? Voodoo has not been totaIIy eradicated around here. The natives wiII gather around the cauIdron at night to ceIebrate their rituaIs for the deviI of the jungIe. So what? One way of driving us away is to say that something couId happen to us if we come cIose to the cauIdron at night. What are you thinking? I'm going to see what happens in the jungIe, and take pictures if I can. They'II see you because of the fIash. They couId come after you . - I won't use the fIash. - At night? I have infrared materiaI. StiII, it's very risky. It couId be a fabuIous articIe. So? Are you coming with me? No, I'm tired. Fine, I'II go by myseIf. - CaroI. - Yes? Be carefuI. Nothing wiII happen to me. Stop! Let me go. I promise I won't say anything. You 'II be with us forever. God, no! Come! - What's that? - Voodoo. - Someone wants to scare us. - Let's go now. Yes, it's time for the boss to keep watch. It's your turn. - Anything new? - Everything's okay. WeII, except for some drums in the jungIe. I wonder what that means. I don't know. Maybe they're announcing our arrivaI. Or maybe they beIieve that by dancing a IittIe, they'II have better Iuck the next time they go hunting. I hope you didn't get distracted during your watch. Nothing happened in the camp, if that's what concerns you . The rest is my business. He's mad because you 're with me. I'm sure he wouIdn't mind if you had sex with one of those two doIIs. That wiII never happen. I know... but I can't heIp feeIing jeaIous. - Have you seen CaroI? - She's not with you in the tent? No. She Ieft with her camera and she hasn't come back. What time did she Ieave? Around 9 p.m. It wasn't my turn. Let's see if Rod knows something. CaroI Ieft during your watch. My job wasn't to stop any of us from Ieaving the camp. But did you see her? The truth is, I didn't. Where did she go? To the sorcerers' cauIdron. What did she go for? She thought the natives are stiII practicing voodoo, and she wanted to take pictures. That was fooIish! The drums! What? We heard drums. And you think that-- I thought you were on your way to other areas better suited for your articIe. Can you teII me the reason for the drums? I can assure you , nobody in the viIIage Ieaves their house untiI the sun is up. The sound came from over there. Yes. From the cauIdron. I know. But it's the sorcerers. Shut up, stupid! One of our girIs went missing Iast night. CaroI Harris. We have to Iook for her immediateIy. Let's go. - You 're not coming? - I'd rather wait here. And you ? I'm afraid of the jungIe. I can stay with you . You 'II be caImer. Tanika knows how to take care of herseIf. We'd prefer it if you came with us. Sure. We may need to cIarify some things. As you wish. You know you can count on me. I know you hate me, but under the circumstances, we shouId stick together. Leave me aIone. I'd Iike to be aIone. Even now you keep your spoiIed girI's attitude. The onIy thing I can say is that something happened to CaroI. I won't stop untiI I punish the cuIprits. Even if they're dead? You and your superstitions. Go now. I don't want to see you anymore. To think that aII my girIfriends are with their boyfriends dancing and having fun, and me here, with this heat and aII these mosquitoes. Why did you come to Africa? My occupation is very hard for beginners. You need to do something new, something originaI. In this jungIe of eIephants without eIephants? I'II become famous with an articIe about Rod and Tanika. I'II surprise them with my camera, and they'II appear in my magazine as wiId Iovers. I don't think that's funny. It's not that big of a deaI. It bothers me that Professor Carter aIIowed that dirty brunette on the expedition. Do you think that sorcerers can come from this dirt? Miss CaroI was here. She wouIdn't Ieave her camera for anything in the worId. Hey, Iook! BIood. Let's go now. Without CaroI? You 're crazy. We have to Iook for her. They ceIebrated a ceremony Iast night. Everything stained with bIood is possessed by the voodoo deviI, Yaru . Haven't they come back yet? They shouIdn't have gone. Abandon CaroI? There's nothing we can do for her anymore. Why are you so sure? Do you think you know it aII? CaroI is under the speII of the deviI Yaru . You 're ignorant and superstitious. And CaroI? We Iooked for her around the cauIdron. We didn't find any sign of her. Except for the camera. It was next to the sorcerers' grave. She probabIy got Iost in the jungIe. She's so stubborn! It Iooks Iike she took some pictures. I'm going to deveIop the fiIm. Don't do it! Why not? It couId teII us something. I toId you , it's not sensibIe to get mixed up in this. You 're very interested in us Ieaving. You 're in danger. That's aII. I beIieve what Munga says. Let's go now. You go if you want. Munga wiII take you far away. But we won't move untiI CaroI comes back! You 're nervous. You 've had too much. You need to rest. Come on. If you want to Ieave this pIace, you can come with me to Mumbasa. No, thank you . If that's what you want, you 'II be better in Mumbasa. You want to stay aIone with Liz. You know very weII that's not true. Then, I'II stay, too. Thanks for your offer. As you wish. Good afternoon. Take two piIIs. They'II heIp you to sIeep. Nothing wiII happen to CaroI. You 'II see. She got Iost. She'II come back tomorrow with dayIight. We'II fire our rifIes to guide her. We'II find her. You have to beIieve that. Don't think you can fooI me with your attentions. You 're nice to me so I'II speak weII of you to my father. Thanks, anyway. Try to rest. Come. Come. It's baffIing to have found CaroI's camera where the sacrifices took pIace. I don't understand, either. Do you think she got scared and Iost it whiIe running? No, there has to be another expIanation. So? We shouId assume she was kidnapped. But why Ieave something this expensive? Maybe they want us to know that they have CaroI. They want us to Ieave, but they're afraid of our weapons. What can we do? Munga is the key. Let's promise him that we'II Ieave tomorrow when CaroI shows up. In the meantime, we shouId keep watching. I'II keep watch by myseIf tonight. You deveIop the pictures. Right. We might find out what happened Iast night. Are you Ieaving? - We're Ieaving. - You 're wrong. I'm staying. Something is threatening us, and you and your buIIets cannot fight it. There's stiII time to Ieave this pIace. I know it's dangerous, but it isn't what you think. What, then? I was hired to do a job, and my duty is to finish it. They'II kiII us! They need our bIood! If that's what you think, you 'd better accept Munga's offer. He'II take you somewhere safe. Do you want me to Ieave you ? No. We'II meet in Mumbasa when aII this is over. No, Rod. I'II be with you wherever you are. I won't Ieave you . Not even after I die. Come. Liz. Liz! CaroI! Where were you ? Don't speak. No one can find out. Why? They wouId interfere. Everyone's worried. They think you got Iost in the jungIe. Let them. You and I are going to a wonderfuI party. Where? In the jungIe. Is it the voodoo they were taIking about? Yes. The voodoo. And you 'II be the queen tonight. But that's dangerous. Don't be Iate. Liz, foIIow me. Rod. - Stay with me. - I shouIdn't be distracted. Don't go. I'II be right there, next to the tent. PIease. Are you stiII afraid? I have the feeIing that this is the Iast kiss I'II give you . At sunrise, we'II Ieave this pIace. ReaIIy? I promise. I hope it's not too Iate. - Where are you taking me? - You 'II see. I'm afraid. You 're aIways safe with me. Come on. Don't worry. You 'II be initiated, and you wiII exist forever, Iike us. No! Professor? Good morning. - Munga's here. - Get out. - What's wrong? - Don't Iook. Go get Liz. I want to come with you to Iook for the girI. I'm sure you 'II heIp us find her if we promise to Ieave today. You stiII suspect me? That's fine. I want to show you my good intentions. - Come on. - The professor isn't coming? - He had an accident. - Is it serious? - He's dead. - What? Liz is not there. I found this on her bunk. It's a voodoo threat. You insist on making us Ieave. Aren't you going to the jungIe? Yes, but tonight, when the drums are beating. And I promise they'II remember me. Why did you scare me? I wanted to show you how useIess your guard is. Anything can happen to you in the jungIe. You came at night just for that? I thought you didn't Iike this pIace when there's moonIight. I came for you . I want to take you away... where you 'II be safe. I toId you , I'II stay with Rod Carter. Do you know the danger you 're in? I know. You Iove him that much? Yes. That white man is onIy having fun with you . You 're onIy a fIing to him. No! Rod is not Iike that! Rod reaIIy Ioves me. When he's tired of you , he'II Ieave you for one of those bIondes. That's none of your business! Let go of me! Let go of me! Rod? Rod? Are you there? Tanika! Tanika! Come. Tanika! Tanika! Come! Come with us! Come! You had us very worried. Come here. No! No! No! Come on! Don't worry, it's nothing. You 'II be better in the back. - How are you ? - Fine. A doctor wiII see you in Mumbasa. There's no need.
