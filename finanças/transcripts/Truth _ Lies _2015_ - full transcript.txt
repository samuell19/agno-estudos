Hey. Hey James. See they got you working the night shift. Yeah. What do you got? Stay in the car Alison. Why? Did you forget? I'm a cop too. Chief is on his way down, okay? Okay, good. You don't want to do this. You don't want to do this. Not now. What am I doing? Please. Wait. Come on. Alison! What has gotten into you? Alison. Alison, come on. No! No!! No!! No!! Dad? No! Honey? Are you okay? I'm fine. It was just a dream. You sure? Yeah, it's okay. I'm sorry Mom. Oh honey, you don't ever have to apologize. I just want to be sure that you're okay. I can't believe it's been two years since the accident. I miss Dad so much. I know. So do I. So do I. Alright, call me if you need anything okay? I'll be fine. Thanks Mom. Okay. Oh, there's Hannah. Still your ex-bff? Absolutely. Well, maybe the two of you will be friends again someday. Mm, not likely. Bye Mom. Thanks again for the great morning. Have a good day. Those pants are so last year. Somebody's hand-me-downs Taylor? Back off Hannah. What, are you going to call your Mom and have me arrested? My Mom's a cop. What's yours again? Oh, I remember. The sleaziest date in town. Oohhhh! You are going to regret that, bitch. Go tell the fashion police when you file the report about my wardrobe. Zach. Taylor. Hi. Babe. Watch out for trash. That was intense. What happened there? Oh well you know Zach used to be Taylor's boyfriend before the accident. Accident? Oh right. I keep forgetting you only transferred in this year. Well, Taylor's Dad died two years ago in a car crash. Geez. Yeah, toasted two other people as well. Totally his fault. That outta ruin your day. Wanna hear the best part? Word around town was that Taylor's Dad was doing Hannah's mom. The mom is super hot by the way. Anyway, Taylor's Dad was on his way back from doing Hannah's mom when it happened. Been bad blood between Taylor and Hannah ever since. Wait, bad blood because of the rumour or bad blood because of the boyfriend steal? Probably both but I mean who knows with chicks, right? Oh, by the way I got your grade ready. Right on. Grade? Oh yeah, Brandon's the man. Want to change your grade, want to watch free porn or download any movie you want? He can do it. No one in the school knows more about computer wizardry than me. I can shape destinies by pushing the right buttons. Right. Cool. Hey I got to get to class so see you guys later? Take it easy. Okay man. Whoa, what's up? I got dropped off at the front today. Hannah and Alexis? And Zach. Well screw them. Don't give them the satisfaction. I held my own. In front of them, anyway. That's my girl. So how was your trip? Great weekend. We crashed a rave. There was lots of dancing and some very cool people. So tell me, did you have a good time? Oh yeah. And did you get to see Sam? I did, and we had the perfect time. Details, please! And did you finally get a picture so I can see what this mystery guy looks like? Later, but I will say he is a great kisser. That's weird. What? I don't know. Someone's messing with me. Well maybe you have a secret admirer. Know what? Really. What, you're a prophet? You're sick, Hannah. Taylor! Dinner! I'll be right there! I totally don't get physics. And why study the theories of some guy who died 500 years ago? Physics are actually a part of our everyday life. I mean you've heard of 'for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, ' right? Well... yeah but I don't really get it. That is a classic example. Hannah shakes her butt and Zach comes running. Seems more like Pavlov's dog syndrome to me. But I think I get where you're going with this. So if I were to pick up this five pound book, wind up and swing it at 50 miles per hour, hitting Hannah in the head, she would hit the ground with an equal and opposite force. Think I might warm up to physics after all. What? I got the exact same message last night. It's creepy. Well, I think it's Hannah. Must be her idea of payback. Maybe, but mine also said a couple other weird things too so I don't know. But, if it is her, she's playing innocent pretty well. I hate her. Your little text stunt was pretty lame Hannah. I'm not really sure what you're trying to accomplish. What are you talking about? On second thought, who cares? Barb and I have been getting anonymous texts and we're pretty sure they're from you. Why would I waste my time texting you two losers? Maybe you have a secret admirer. Guess you're more popular than I thought. Don't give up, Taylor. Maybe one day you'll have a boyfriend again. Well, I'd love to stay and chat about your imaginary bf but I have a lunch date with my real one. Bye. What... Save your breath. She's not worth it. Oh, I'll catch up with you later, okay? Hey. How you doing? Hey. Time to hang out? Sure. Although you run the risk of being marked trash. It's alright. I think it's worth the risk. I was heading outside for some fresh air. You want to come? Yeah, that'd be nice. The stench in here is pretty thick. You realize you probably just killed any chance you may have had of hanging with the cool kids. It's alright. Like I said, if I happen to hang with the cliques. Just the ones I like I guess. And you came here at the beginning of the year right? Yeah my Dad got transferred for work this summer so... So curse or...? We'll have to see. It's kind of soon to say. Uh. Sorry I gotta run. Friend in need. Maybe we could grab a coffee, go for a walk or hit a movie sometime? Yeah. I'd like that. Alright. See you later. Yeah. Hey. What's wrong? I don't know if it's Hannah or someone else but I was talking on the phone with Sam and I got a text in it and it said whoever it was was listening in on the call. Can you guys give us a minute? A minute please? Are you serious? They know what I do on weekends. And there was even some stuff about Sam that was really private. What kind of stuff? I don't want to say, Taylor. I'm too upset to talk about it. But, this thing, it's not good. I'm really freaking out. Look, I can go to my Mom's work after school and see if there's any way we can trace the identity of the sender. But, you're not going to get her involved in this? Don't worry. I'm just going to find out whatever information I can. Okay and you promise you're not going to tell your Mom about anything, like that it's me or... Don't worry, Barb. What's gotten into you? Sorry, it's just... Okay relax. It's all good okay. If I go in maybe we can figure out who this jerk is. Simple as that. Okay. I just want this to go away. If your mom can do that then sure. It's going to be okay. Come on. Hi Mom! Hey honey! Come on in. What a nice surprise. So nice to see you. What happening? What's this? Sherrie Makblar. 34. Mother of three. Left her homeland five years ago after her husband was killed in the insurgence. That's awful. Yeah. I'm going to find who did this. I know you will. So what brings you here? I have a question for you. Do you know if it's possible to trace internet text logs and identities? And this would be about...? It's for a school project. Well, it's not really my area of expertise but Detective Marco just transferred here from Philly and he did a lot of undercover surveillance work. He's the best we have when it comes to electronic know-how. Hey. Can you come here for a minute? Great. We'll see what he says. What's up? Hey Marco. You know my daughter Taylor. Hi. Hi. Taylor was just asking if it's possible to trace internet identities from texts. Hmm. Well the short answer is yes, the longer answer would be complicated. I mean it's easy enough to retrieve the messages but tracing them is a whole other story. Net traces you need search warrants, and computer wizards to work their magic. So this isn't something simple, like anyone could do the tracing? No, no. It's a little more complicated than tracing a phone number for instance. You need resources, a pretty savvy tech guy. Tell you what. I'm fighting the clock on this case I'm working right now but if you want, I'll let your Mom know when I have some extra time, we can sit down and I'll give you a detailed explanation of the whole process. That'd be great. Thank you. You're welcome. It's nice to meet you. Thanks Marco. I should get going. Alright. Thanks Mom. See you later. No. No! No no no no. Oh my god. Oh come on! Pick up, pick up, pick up. You know what to do. Leave a message. Zach, call me back the second you get this. Oh my God. Zach why didn't you answer my calls or return my messages last night? I bet you think this is funny, don't you? A videotape of you and me having sex in the car... Woah, woah, woah, woah! Taylor! Taylor! I got the same video last night. I didn't post it. Yeah right, then why didn't you call me back? I was with Hannah. I couldn't exactly up and call you. Besides, I was going to see you today. Taylor, you know me. I wouldn't do this. Seriously. I didn't do this I swear. Then who did? I don't know. Do you know if anyone else got it? We would have heard about it by now. Trust me. So I think it's just the two of us. If it wasn't you it must have been Hannah. No no, there's no way. You know how jealous she gets. She would never post something like that. If she even just saw that video she would probably cut my... I'm willing to take that risk. Where is she? I'm telling you she had nothing to do with it, and showing her that video is going to set her off. Well sorry if this is going to put a kink in your little fairy-tale romance but I'm shutting that bitch down. She's gone too far. What the hell? Who is this? Oh you bitch. I've been looking for you. I've been looking for you, too. Leave! This is a new low even for you. You have a lot of nerve. I have a lot of nerve? You and I hate each other, that's the way we like it, but bringing my mother into this? Your mother? I know you think I pulled some lame-ass text prank the other day, which I already told you I didn't. But even if I did, you have crossed the line. I have no idea what you're talking about. You're right Hannah, I do hate you. But this wasn't me. I got a message from that jerk too. A video. We need to figure out who this is. We? No way. Hey. What's going on? I just got another message and he, she, whatever is threatening to expose me. Expose you? For what? Barb what is it? You know how you keep asking me to show you a photo of Sam but I keep saying I forgot to take one? Yeah. Well, I do have a photo but I don't want to show it to you. And there's a reason, I swear, and I was going to tell you when I was ready but now it can't wait. This is Sam. Or... or... Samantha. Okay. I'm gay. That doesn't matter to me. I don't care who you like as long as you're happy. Thanks Taylor, but I don't think my parents would agree with you. They would be devastated and not to mention that school is difficult enough to deal with now, but can you imagine what it'll be like when everyone knows? Whoever's doing this is sick. We have to find out who they are and stop them. I know. But I can't think of who'd be horrible enough to do this. And why? I talked to my Mom about tracing. What did she say? It's more difficult than I thought. But there's a detective that's going to talk to me more about it. Okay great. Whoever this is, is creeping me out. Hello? Hey Taylor, it's Cody. I was wondering if maybe you want to hang out later? Hi Cody. I'm actually out for lunch with a friend right now. Okay, well what about later? Sure. Text me in a bit. What's wrong? I never gave him my number. Weird. Do you think there's any chance that he could be the creep who's doing this? No. I mean, he just asked me out so... it wouldn't really make sense. Hey don't stress about this Sam thing. I promise you, you won't have to tell your parents before you're ready. Thanks. We'll figure this out, okay? Hey. Hey Cody. Can I ask you something? Sure. Yeah, anything. How did you get my number? I have my sources but I've been sworn to secrecy. On the pain of death. I want to know now or this conversation is over. I'm sorry; I was trying to impress you with my ingenuity. And? Brandon. I bribed him for it and he gave it to me. Brandon. Figures. Did you help yourself to any more confidential information? Look, I'm sorry. I like you but I didn't mean to overstep. Actually, I'm sorry. I'm just kind of freaked out lately. I've been getting these weird messages. Is that why you're upset that I have your number? You think I'm some kind of cyber stalker? No, no. I don't think that. But you can understand why I'm being paranoid. Right. What are the messages? If you don't mind me asking. Some pretty awful stuff. Let's talk about it over coffee. Hey Mom! Hey. What's up? Is everything alright? Yeah. Why? You've been awfully quiet the last few days and I'm a detective but a Mom first and I know when something's bothering you. I'm okay. I'm just tired. You know, exams and everything. You sure? Yeah. How's your case going? Oh you know, just interviewing witnesses and narrowing down suspects. Well they've got the right detective on the job. Alright well I'm going clean up a couple hours here at the office so if you need me, this is where I'll be. Thanks Mom. We'll see you later. Okay. Bye. Hey Barb. How's it going? Okay, I guess. I haven't gotten any weird messages tonight. Have you? No. Nothing. Hannah and Zach were sent videos from the freak. Weird. Is it bad? Zach was sent the same one as mine. Someone filmed us making out in his car. Hannah's was about her Mom. You know how her Mom is. Then that means that Hannah and Zach can't be Truth&Lies. Maybe. Maybe not. They could just be setting the whole thing up. I don't get it. Why now? I don't know. Taylor, I'm scared. Me too. But we shouldn't let whoever's doing this know that. See you at school tomorrow. Okay, see ya. Bye. Hey Taylor. Hey. Hey, can I ask you something? About what you said yesterday? Sure. By any chance, was the person sending you those messages called Truth&Lies? Yeah. I got a text from them last night. Are you serious? Yeah. Is it bad? You could say that. Can we go somewhere private and talk about it? Okay. Okay. Alright, remember how I told you we got transferred here because of my Dad's work? Well that was kind of a lie. We actually got transferred because of me. I got in a little bit of trouble with the police back home and it got me expelled so my parents figured it was a good idea if I had a fresh start in a new state at my aunt's house. Cody, don't have to tell me. There was an assault charge. I beat a guy up pretty bad. Was it justified? An older guy got my sister drunk and well, you know. She made me promise I wouldn't tell our parents and didn't want to get the cops involved so... What did you do? Kicked his ass. Put him in the hospital. Hey. If I had an older brother, I'd want him to do the same thing. Cops got involved but he wouldn't say anything. I guess a few days in the hospital kind of set him straight. They knew it was me but they couldn't prove anything so my Dad just thought it was a good idea for me to come here at least until things died down a little. Sorry I lied to you. It's okay. I understand. Alright. Come on, let's go. I'm watching you, Taylor. How are you doing this? There's a lot more that I can do. Why are you doing this? Because you don't understand hurt. But you will and more. You're crazy. Just leave us alone. I choose when I'm done. There's more to do. Leave me alone! Wow, someone's having a bad day. Sorry. I just heard from that freak again. He phoned in on my computer this time. It's so creepy, he sounds like Darth Vader. He's threatening to do more. Taylor I just got another message. He says he's going to kick things up a notch. We need to do something. I think our best chance to stop him is a united front. What do you mean? Well so far there are five of us who have gotten messages from him. You, me, Hannah, Zach and now Cody. We need to put our heads together and brainstorm. You're my best friend and it was hard enough for me to share this with you. There's no way I'm letting them know. Then everyone would. You don't have to tell them anything. Just that you're on his list. All five of us have something we'd rather keep private so no one will pry. Trust me. You really think this is the best way? I do. I mean, teaming up with Hannah is the last thing I want to do. I'm sure she won't be thrilled about it either but I don't see any other option. I'll see if I can set up a meeting with everyone tomorrow. Okay. Just let me know where and when. Okay. You called us here. What do you have to say? Look Hannah. We have a common enemy that's a lot more serious than our petty differences. You think I want you nosing around in my private business? Look, no one needs to know what the freak has on each other but Taylor's right. We need to work together to find him. Okay. Where do we start? Do you know if anyone else has been getting these messages? Who would have the ability to hack into our stuff and spy on us? There's only one person I can think of who'd have that kind of skill. Brandon. The other day he was talking about what a computer whiz he was, that nobody was as good as he was and that he could shape destinies with the push of a button. Also he assembled a computer lab which would give him access to all of our info. If he's half as good as he says he is, that would give him a foot in. Still can't imagine it would be Brandon but I vote we check him out. What do you think Cody? I agree. I say we check out the computer lab. Cool, alright. You guys can keep watch. This way. Hey hey hey. Hey it's over here. I watched Brandon push it in once. It's uh.. 4144. Check out his computers. Jamie's that's the fifth time you've missed class this semester. Once more and you're out. Son of a bitch. You find something? Yeah, this little weasel's got the whole school wired up for picture and audio. He's got cameras and mics everywhere. Looks like we found Truth&Lies. This guy's sick. There he is. Oh damn. Get out now. He's on his way. Shut it down. What the hell's going on here? Why don't you tell us what the hell's going on. I'm going to get security. You're busted Brandon. You've got surveillance on the whole school. From the principal's office, to classes, oh and best of all the girls' locker room. So no, I don't think you're going to go to security. You gonna tell me what you want? This ends, here and now. You delete any more video footage you have on us, and the texts and threats stop or you're going down. I don't know what you're talking about. Texts and threats? You're in no position to play dumb with us, Brandon. This little set up of yours would definitely get you expelled and ruin any chance of you getting a scholarship anywhere, let alone that ivy league school you think you're going to. Do I really look like the kind of person that goes around threatening people? No. You look like the kind who sits behind a computer and does it. You've been warned. Brandon! You okay? Uh yeah. You know if you need anything just let me know. Now you will learn from the pain of others the consequences of your actions. Hey. He just sent me a text saying my time is up. He's going to out me on every major social media networking site from Facebook to Instagram. Okay don't panic. So far he hasn't followed through with any of his threats. Okay just meet me at Mario's please. I just need to get out of the house. Give me 15, I'll see you there. Hey. Taylor I'm scared. My family will disown me and I'm not ready for people to know. Look, I don't think he's actually going to go through with it. Hello Barb! It's Showtime! No, no, no, no... No, no, no... Oh, my god! No, no, no... What do I do? It's everywhere! Barb! Barb!!! Hey Taylor, what are you up to? Not now, maybe later. Cody? Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. That was close. I saw everything. Do you want me to call the cops? No. I am okay. Are you sure? Yeah, thanks. Barb pick up. I'm going to call every 10 minutes until you pick up this phone. My life's over, Taylor. It's over. No, it's not. It'll be okay. This is awful but it's going to be okay. No it's not. I can't face anyone, especially at school. Not even my parents. I'm going to help you though this, I promise. No one can help me. Are you at home? Yeah, why? Your parents there too? No and I'm not going to tell them if that's what you're getting at. It's not what I'm saying. I just don't want you to be alone right now. I'm going to come over, okay? No. No. We'll talk about it tomorrow. You don't understand, I can't even face you. I have to go. Barb. Barb! Hey. What's going on? Just some friend problems. Oh. Well is your friend going to be alright? I think so. Okay. Must be important if it can't wait until morning. Alison. We have a possible 10-56. Juvenile female, hanging by the balcony. I'll be right there. Couple came home. Found their daughter hanging from the balcony. Looks like it could be a suicide. Hey Mom. Where were ya? I had a late call last night. Taylor I have some bad news. You're probably going to want to sit down. Mom. What is it? You're scaring me. Honey I just came from Barb's house. She committed suicide. No! No! No please don't say that. No Mom no. No! Sweetie I know that this is really hard for you but I need to talk to you about Barb. Try to figure out why she did this. Did anything happen recently that may have caused her to do something like this? Last night Barb was outed. Outed? Barb was gay. I didn't even know until two days ago. She only told me because someone was threatening to make her secret public. You know who this someone is? She didn't know. We didn't know. How did they out her? Social media. Facebook. Twitter. Everything. They hit the computer of everyone she knows complete with video. And that's who you were talking to last night? I begged her to let me come over and talk to her. She wouldn't let me. I should have gone over anyway. Honey. This is not your fault. There's nothing you could have done honey. I can't believe you're gone. Such a sad face. A pleasure to speak again. You're sick. We're going to find out who you are. You're responsible for her death. She killed herself. You drove her to it. You might as well have tied a noose around her neck. Don't be such a drama queen. Barb was yesterday's news. Today I'm calling to let you know your time is coming soon, but look at the bright side. At everyone will know you're definitely not gay. Put an end to all those nasty rumors about you and Barb. You should be thanking me. You son of a bitch. It was a touching tribute to Barb. Black is your colour. You looked lovely. He contacted me last night. Said I was next. He also said he was at the tribute. What? He was there? We need to tell them about Brandon. We found something in the back of the computer lab. Brandon has this whole computer screen surveillance setup. Why didn't you tell us? Because we have no proof that he is Truth&Lies. I mean he's got cameras and videos set up everywhere. Since this thing happened with Barb I think we should tell the police. Get to the bottom of it. It has to be him. Who else could it be? That jerk always freaked me out. Hey Taylor. I told Hannah what he has on us. Another reason I want to nail Brandon before he goes public and humiliates Zach. You mean yourself? Whatever. It's bad for all of us. She's right. We need to nail this guy. And fast. I'll tell my mom everything tonight. Walk with me for a bit? Yeah. Yeah, sure. If I had said something earlier about Brandon, maybe Barb would not have killed herself. This isn't your fault. It doesn't make me feel any better. Stop blaming yourself. It's not your fault. I like you Taylor. I like you too. I wish I could just stay here with you but I gotta go to the station and tell my mom about Brandon. Okay. Can you see me later? Yeah. Mom. Hey. What's going on? We think we know who outed Barb. Really? Who? Brandon Drake. He was in charge of setting up the school's computer system. He started acting kind of weird so Zach and Cody went to confront him and found out he's been spying on the entire school with surveillance he built into the system. Did they find any proof that he's Truth&Lies? No, but I thought you should know. Alright. I'll look into it. But in the meantime it's probably best if we just kept this between the two of us. Something just doesn't seem right about this case. It's a case now? The coroner still has to make a ruling on the cause of death. It looks like a suicide but... But? Women, girls, just don't usually kill themselves like this. They tend to use less violent, gentler methods. Oh my god. Sweetheart, I am sorry. I didn't want to have this conversation with you. You've already been through so much. You really think she was murdered? When investigating someone's death, it's a process of elimination. And until every avenue's been eliminated, anything's possible. Hey. Hey. Any developments? I spoke to my Mom. She said she's going to check out Brandon. Good. Maybe this will end this nightmare. I just can't believe that geek would have the balls. Neither can I. But we can't take that risk. Better leave it up to the cops for now. We can't tell anyone about this. If Brandon is Truth&Lies, we don't want to tip him off. My Mom says we should avoid him and the computer lab and not a word until they can investigate. Sounds like they're taking it seriously. They are. My Mom says something feels wrong about the case and it might go further than we think. What? You're saying you think Barb was murdered? Keep your voice down. Wait, Taylor, do you seriously think she was murdered? She was outed. I can't imagine what that must be like. I don't even know what I'd do with myself in that situation. Yeah Taylor I have to agree with Hannah. Barb was pretty fragile and it's not the first time somebody killed themselves over being outed. Look, I didn't say I think she was murdered but you know my Mom's a detective. She said the police department is looking into the theory. We gotta go. See you at lunch. Did you have a nice little chat with your friends this morning? Bastard. You're nothing but a coward. You should learn to play nice. I'm going to do everything possible to stop you before you can hurt anyone else. I've only just begun with you. The others are purely for my amusement. I've waited a long time for this. What's that supposed to mean. When I'm ready you'll know. Screw you. Hello there. Uh hi. You looking for Hannah? Yep. She's upstairs. Your mom's partying by herself again. Forget about my mom. Maybe you need some help to do that. Not now. I'm busy. Hello Hannah. The show's about to begin. Stars your Mom. You're lying! You have nothing. Let's let the world decide. Don't do this or else... Or else what? When I get my hands on you, I am going to... That's what your mother said. Enjoy the show. It's showtime. No no no, please don't do this. Heather. Alison, good to see you. Hi. You know my partner, Marco. Detective Marco. Hi. How you doing? I've been better. When one of my kids kills themselves because they feel like they can't face their peers, it makes me feel like I've failed at my job. Well, I think you're being a little hard on yourself. I appreciate the heads up you guys were coming over, but your office wouldn't say why. We're investigating Barb's death and we need a little information. Barb's suicide. Why would there be an investigation? Well, we find the details of Barb's suicide suspicious and worth investigating before closing the file. Are you serious? Mhm. We have reason to believe the school's computer lab and data banks may have been used and compromised by whoever bullied Barb. I'll need full access for electronic forensics. In the meantime, until our investigation is complete, the lab will be off limits to student and staff. Well you aware of how confidential these files are. I assume you have a warrant? Assumed correctly. Okay. Where do you want to start? Computer lab. Okay, just down here. Okay it's just right down here. It's the second door on the left. Oh thank you. We've got it from here. Okay, good luck. Apparently this kid's got some kind of lair he works out of. Oh, let's try that. The code should be 4144, according to the kids. Whoa. Wow. This is pretty high tech for a high school kid. Alright work your magic in cyberspace. I'm going to poke around here in the real world for a bit. It's going to take me a little bit of time to access the systems. Alright get to it. Boy things sure have changed since I was in school. Uh oh. Looks like our boy Brandon's in trouble. Found something detective? Rohypnol. Okay I'm in. Wow. This kid has the whole school wired. Look at that. He's in this deep. Spy cams, hacking government files, this breaks numerous state and federal laws. Wait a second. What's this? Bingo. What do you got? Human hair. Smoking gun. Keep processing. I'm going to go find this kid. Hey, just in time. Bag this. Oh that's him there. Alright. Well it's best if I go and speak with him alone. Okay. Thanks. Brandon Drake? Yeah. Might I have word with you? In private? Why? About what? I didn't do anything. We both know that's not true. Now you can either come with me voluntarily for a little chat or I can arrest you here in front of all your friends. Arrest me? Stop! Brandon! Hey! Get off of me! I didn't do anything! For someone that's innocent, you sure are acting pretty guilty Brandon. You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. This is your case. What do you want to do? Hit him with good cop bad cop? No. No look at him. He's scared. He doesn't know what we have on him. I'll run him down. So. Want to do this the easy way and tell me what happened and why? Alright well I've got all the time in the world here. If you don't want to talk now, I can go home and have a nice relaxing evening, nice supper. And you can get acquainted with your new friends in Cell Block C. Doesn't matter what I say, you're not going to believe me. Try me. I'm innocent. I had nothing to do with Barb's death. Okay like I said, the truth will come out eventually. And how fast that happens and how painful the process is all depends on you. If you've got something to confess, now's the time to do it. Okay. Okay what? I admit it. Admit what? I wired my surveillance system into the mainframe of the school. I know it was stupid but I was just trying to have a little fun. I don't see why you're treating it like a murder case. Because it is one! But right now your petty little spy cam prank is at the bottom of my priorities list. What I want to talk about is Barb's death. Now we already have several pieces of evidence linking you to the crime. That's impossible! I only know what everybody else knows! Which is what? That someone's been cyberstalking! I'm sure you know all about it. Let's assume I don't. It started with outing Barb and then video of Hannah's mom with half the married men in town. And the video of Taylor and Zach. Taylor and Zach? Yeah it's a video of them making out. It's got like a thousand hits. It's all over the internet. I'll be right back. You okay? You want me to talk to him for a bit? No. No, just put the kid on ice for the night. I'm going to check out something he said. Will do. Taylor. What have you gotten yourself into? When did he put the video out there? A couple days ago. I'm so embarrassed mom. I just wish you would have come to me. I didn't know what to do. It's okay. Just so you know, I was a teenager once also. We just didn't have all this social media to record our mistakes. I'm sorry Mom. Did Brandon really do it? Well he says he's innocent but they all do at first. And then we wear them down. I think he'll confess soon enough. There's more than enough evidence that points to him. What evidence? We have the rope that he used to strangle her with. A bottle of rohypnol that was stolen from the hospital and found in her system. Some other stuff. It appears that he just set it up to look like a suicide. I feel horrible mom. Don't worry. Brandon can't hurt anymore anymore. Hi Taylor. Hey. Is it really over? Yeah. My mom says there's more than enough evidence. They finally nailed that bastard. Yeah. Who knew such a computer geek like Brandon could have turned out to be so cold-blooded? Do you know that at any time there are 50 serial killers working the country? And they look just like your every-day normal person. Like Brandon. How do you know this stuff? When your Mom's a detective, what can I say? Taylor. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Taylor. I want to apologize. I've been a complete bitch to you. I just didn't know how to deal with, you know... I've realized it wasn't your fault or mine. And I hope you can forgive me. And maybe we can hang out again? Sure. We were best friends once. I hope we can get there again. Yeah. Me too. You and Taylor are hitting it off. You could say fate brought us together. How was your night? Make any new friends? I swear I had nothing to do with Barb's death. I don't know what evidence you have on me but it's wrong. We have enough evidence to make this a pretty strong open-and-shut case with you. Let's start with that we found Barb's hair and the rohypnol in your little lair. That can't be. That doesn't make any sense. Well it all adds up pretty nicely from where I'm sitting. If I did do it, why would I be stupid enough to keep it there? Can I have a word? What are you doing? He's about to crack. It definitely looks like he's about to crack but I don't think he's going to confess. What do you got? I don't think he's our guy. The timelines don't make sense. We traced the rohypnol to St. Jude's Hospital. It was stolen just prior to Barb's death. So? So. Brandon was definitely logged onto the school's computer when the drugs were stolen. We have surveillance footage from the hospital with time codes. He couldn't be in two places at once. Alright. Let's pull video from every camera within a six block radius and see what we find. No problem. It's going to take some time. Do you think it's possible that he bought the pills from the thief? I mean given the time of the death, the time of the theft, proximity of the hospital, school and Barb's house, I have to say no. Alright. What are you working on, mom? Is that Barb's case? It is. How's it going? Not as well as I thought. What do you mean? Brandon might not be guilty after all. There's no evidence on any of his computers linking him to the murder or being the cyber stalker. We're also pretty sure he couldn't have gotten the sedatives or been at Barb's house when she died. What about all the evidence that you found? Well we're still processing but it's just not adding up. So you're just going to let him go? We'll we're not going to release him until we check out a few more details but in the event that Brandon isn't the killer, the real murderer's still out there so I just, I just want you to be extra careful and in constant contact with me, okay? Okay. Hey Cody. Hey Taylor. What's up? Not much. I miss you and I was hoping to see you later. I'd like that. What do you have in mind? Well it's a surprise. Really? Pick you up later. Hi Mrs. Sinclair. I'm Cody. I'm here to pick up Taylor. Taylor! Cody's here! That's a nice car. Thanks! '71 Skylark. There's only two in town. Sweet. Did you want to come in for a moment? No Mom it's okay. Alrighty then. Well you kids have fun. Nice to meet you. You too. Bye. Hey Marco. I need you to come to the station. There's something you should see. Alright I'm on my way. Your mom seems nice. You're lucky she's in a good mood and not pretending to clean her gun while she asks what your intentions are. I was wondering why the hottest girl in the school didn't date. So what's the surprise? Well if I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise. Right. I'm going to stop by the house real quick. I gotta pick something up before we tear it up. Okay. This is where you live? Yeah. Come on in. I'll show you around. I like it here. Nice and quiet. No neighbors around. Your house is awesome. Yeah it reminds me a lot of the house I used to live in with my parents actually. You said you live with your aunt now though, right? I did. Is she here? No. No, it's just us. Are these your parents in these photos? Yes. I was wondering if you'd recognize them actually. Sorry? Recognize them? Well I assumed you studied their faces the way I studied your father's? What are you talking about Cody? How did you know my father? I wanted to know what kind of guy he was, so I studied his face. Do you ever wonder what kind of people my parents were? Cody, please tell me what you're talking about. This is getting weird. Have another look at that photo; the one over on the mantle. Oh my God. Your parents were the people who were killed. That's right. The people your father killed two years ago were my parents, yeah. Is this... what's going on? He took them away from me. Do you have any idea how much pain that caused me? I do. I lost my Dad. Your Dad deserved to die. My parents were innocent! You. You're Truth&Lies. Yeah. I've been planning it for a really long time too. See Truth&Lies was a diversion so I could do what I had to do. I needed to set somebody up like Brandon, he was my guy. You murdered Barb. Why? She didn't do nothing to you. She was your friend. And I wanted you to suffer knowing you were responsible for her death. I warned you. I went to her house. She was alone, it was perfect. She never even saw it coming. I made it look like a suicide. Then things started to get suspicious and I had to adapt. Brandon was perfect. I planted the rope, the drugs but now he's being let free and now I have to adapt again. So now, the last part of my plan. What do you mean? What are you going to do? I'm going finish what I started. I had you in my sights once and I let you go. I could have run you down like a dog in the street. That was you. But we were on the phone. I recorded myself and played it back to you. Hey Taylor. What you up to? UGH!!! So what do you got for me? I took a walk around St. Jude's trying to figure out what camera angles would be most useful for us. Narrowed things down considerably. I think I found something. Good work. Check this out. This is from the surveillance camera right around the corner. Lucky for us it's at the right angle to capture the hospital's rear delivery entrance. Gotcha. Mhm. And note the time. Matches the timeframe the rohypnol was stolen from the hospital. Can you zoom in? Yeah I'm just about to. Can't make out his face. No. Looked at several different angles. Can't get a good look at him. Hold on, there's one more camera I can check. What is it? I know that car. What? Yeah. Pick up pick up honey. She's not answering. She always picks up. Taylor, when you get this message call me honey. It's urgent!!! Cody is not who he says he is. Just get away from him now. What's going on? My daughter's on a date with this guy. What? Yeah, his name's Cody. I don't know his last name. Okay. Alright alright. Let me see if I can zoom in on the plate. Hurry. Yeah no luck. When he came to pick her up he said it was a '71 Skylark. He said there were only two in this town. Okay, let me check out DMV records. Okay. Alright I'll keep digging. He's pretty clever but I'll find him. Alright put an APB out on the car. I'm going to go check out the crop location. Alright, I'll let you know when I find something. Alright. Come on pick up. Pick up. Damnit! Cody. Don't strain yourself. Let me go. Not on your life. Do you have any idea how long I've waited for this moment? For what moment? Justice. To make you feel as miserable as I do. I still don't understand. Are you kidding me? I haven't done anything to you. You took everything from me! That night, your father obliterated my life. Took my parents from me. You didn't even care. You just cared about your Dad. I cried for your parents too, Cody. Oh did you? Did you go to their funeral? Did you call? Did you make any sort of contact whatsoever? Huh? No. We didn't exist to you. I'm sorry... Shut up. It's a little late for that now. What have you got? Cody is an alias. His real name is Lucas Williams. His parents were killed in the same accident your husband died in. Oh my god. A year and a half after his parents died he assumed his current identity then he transferred to Taylor's school. I think he's been tracking her. Is he still living at home on Crofton Avenue? Yeah. Looks like it. Alright well I'm almost there. Alison don't do anything until back up arrives. He's got my daughter. I really am sorry. You're not allowed to apologize anymore. Please stop this. You're scaring me. What are you going to do? I'm going to kill your mother. I'm going to kill her so you know what it feels like to lose the thing you love most in this world. And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. Oh Cody please. Please don't. No, please. Please don't. Maybe killing you too will tell me there's justice in this world. It's not justice. It's murder. I know killing you won't bring them back. But it will let me sleep at night, knowing I don't have to suffer anymore. You're crazy. No. No!!!!!!!!!!!! Bitch. You ruined everything. I was coming for you. It's over Lucas. We know who you really are. Put the gun down. Like hell I will. Where's Taylor? Where is she? I wanted her to watch you die. Now I have to kill you both. Where is she?! I'll take you to your precious Taylor. Lucas you don't have to do this, okay? It's not too late. Okay? It's not too late. No. Yes. Where was help when my parents died, huh? Huh? Come on. No. No no no no. Taylor! Taylor! Please, we can work this out. Come on. Put the gun down. It's over. Well I guess there's no need to keep your Mom alive! It's all over. You can join the rest of your family now. UGH! Make one move and I will kill you. Mom! I thought you were dead. No, I'm alright. Are you okay? Yeah. Don't you move. You should have shot higher. Lucky for me I'm wearing a bulletproof vest. It's over. Great. And your daughter? She's fine. Okay. Good. See you back at the station. Alright. This isn't over. When I give the courts my sob story about how I was grief-stricken, they're going to let me off with a light sentence and I'll see you girls soon. Ignore him. He's going away for a long time. Can we go home? Yeah. I love you, Mom. I love you too, sweetie.
