Ha! Do you think I created some monster from dead body parts... I stole from the cemetery or something? [Crowd Grumbling] [Man] Blecch! No! We just thought that maybe-— Ridiculous! Now, shoo. Shoo!

I think so. [Gasps] Where's my Cap? What happened, Alvin? Trip over your ego? [Screaming] I bet Alvin would feel better I-if I had something to eat. Why don't we find a snack bar? Hello? A snack bar?

I never liked you, even as a small child. [Uneasy Chuckling] I can see you're a decisive man. A man who knows what he wants. -Take me to the castle now. Right away. Absolutely! Posthaste! Lovely bag! Must have cost an arm and a leg. Actually, an arm and two legs. But I hate roller coasters! Well, Dragonland's not a roller coaster. -Oh! Really? -Really. A roller coaster just goes up and down and around. Dragonland does all of that, plus... it surrounds you with incredibly realistic... fire-breathing, mythical monsters... with yard-long, razor-sharp teeth, and claws-- Mm-mm-mm! -Silence, my little friend. You're scaring Theodore to death. [Chuckling] Sorry, Theodore. Are you okay? Nothing a little snack couldn't cure. Dragonland's the best! Wow! I'm goin' again! Yeah. Me too. I still got hearing in one ear. No! Oh, quit fighting, pal. You're gonna love this. Trust me! [Thunderclap] [Man] Hey, come on. Open up. Open up! Silence! [Gasping] - Can't you read English? It's closed! - [Screaming] Go on! Get! Shoo! Before I turn you into luncheon meat! [Screaming] Whoa-ohh-ohhh! [Panting] Uh, Herr Doctor, don't take this as a criticism, but this is a tourist attraction. We usually try not to threaten the guests. Und "have a nice day." That's the spirit!

[Thunderclap] [Alvin] Hey, let's take the tram. - [Man Groaning] - Hey! Watch it! [Theodore] Sorry. Excuse me. [Theodore Grunting] Ah! Mm. Ow! Dragonland, here we come! [Coughing On P.A., Loudspeaker Squealing] [Man On P.A.] Are we on? Hi! Welcome to the Majestic Movie Studio Tour, where fun and fantasy and folks like you... find fabulous filmland fulfillment... with your new friend, Phil-- that's me! [Phil] Now, get your cameras ready, 'cause we just might see some celebrities today! - Would you like that? - [Together] Yes! That's "Yes, Phil!" - [Together] Yes, Phil. - Now, before we get going, is anybody here a producer? - Hmm? - Ahh. Mm-hmm. Not even for cable? Well, okay. [Sighs] You know, folks, here in our little corner of the Hollywood dream factory, we shoot over 500 hours of TV shows and movies in a year. And yet, incredibly talented actors are reduced to driving bus loads... of ungrateful vacationeers on studio tours-- Uh-- [ Coughs, Chuckles] Well, then-- Now, here's where they shot that unforgettable scene in High Society Lowlifes... where Sir Arthur tells Natasha he's leaving her! Oh! It's one of my favorites! "I'm not the man you want, Natasha. I'll only make you... miserable." [Tourists Grumbling] - Uh, Phil, if I may-- - Hey! "I'm not the man you want, Natasha. "I'll only make you... miserable. You want someone who wants to settle down and start a family." "Don't tell me what I want, Arthur. "You're the only man I've ever loved. [Tourists] Aww! Will ever love." [Sniffling] Oh! Oh! This is where the sister comes in. "Natasha! Natasha! Daddy's gone!" [Weeping] "No!" [Clapping, Cheering] Listen, you little... beaver, or muskrat or whatever you are-- Don't... touch... the cap. Oh! You think you can do this job better than me? - Duh. - [Tires Squealing] [Phil Screaming] Whoa-ho! [Screaming] [Tourists] Whoa! Aah! [Phil Screaming] Alvin, these people are paying for a tour! At least give them one! No time, Simon. I'm getting us to Dragonland. Remember, Miranda, you think you just married the man of your dreams, only to discover it was his evil twin brother... Who doesn't know that you're his brother's fiance's twin sister. - Action! - [Tires Screeching] To your left is the New York street... where they shot Guys and-- duh! [Grunts] [Screaming] To your left is a screaming bridesmaid. To your right is the mother of the groom. You're driving right crazy. Straight ahead, that's international star Miranda Burstynpfeiffer. Gee, she sure can jump. Who wants to go again? - [Crowd Cheering] Me! I will! I will! - Give me that key, m-maggot! - [Crowd] Aww! - Much better. But you might want to put the emphasis on "maggot." [Shouting Good-byes] [Chuckling] Looks like we'll have to walk to Dragonland. [Coughing] I don't want to rain on your parade, but our show? We've got plenty of time. I know a shortcut. Trust me. I hate it when he says that. But they were due back a half-hour ago! I could lose my job over this. [Dave] Gee, Mr. Yesman, I-I'm really sorry. I can't imagine where they could be. Well, of course they want to perform at the world premiere. I know you've got a very hard job. No, I-I'm sure your mother would be disappointed if you lost it. Mr. Yesman. M-M-Mr.Yesman! I assure you that the Chipmunks are professionals. It's not like them to be late. Who am I kidding? "Late" is Alvin's middle name. I better get to the theme park and see if I can find them. [Man On P.A.] Ladles and gentlemen, thank you for visiting me, Sammy Squirrel, at Majestic Movie Studio's park. Come again soon. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Arms, two. Legs, two. Feet-- one! Now, where did I put that-- [Growling] - Herr Doctor? - What now? Oh, my goodness. You've accomplished quite a bit for one afternoon! - I do not like to waste time. - And, uh, what are these? - Brains. - [Laughing] Uh, how-- how realistic. Yes. They are. What size shoe do you wear? [Stammering] M-Me? Oh, you don't want-- I mean-- My right foot's so much larger than my-- I had to special order all my-- W-Well, good night! [Footsteps Receding] Ah! Never mind. Here it is. [Simon] Great shortcut, Alvin. We've been walking for hours, and I've yet to see a single dragon. Yeah, and I'm still hungry. [Gasps] Our show's been canceled. What do you suggest we do now, Mr. Reliable? Okay, okay, I admit it. We missed our show, the park is closed, we're probably locked in, and it's all my fault! There. Are you happy? I'm just fuzzy all over. [Whimpering] I can't stay here all night! Teddy will get cold. Don't worry, Theodore. So we're locked in overnight. [Chuckles] What's the worst that can happen? [Growling] Well, I guess we could starve to death. Or lions could escape from their cages... and tear us limb from limb! Or maybe the ghost of some silent movie star... could wrap his cold, green, lifeless hands... around our little throats and-- Or we find a phone, call Dave and have him pick us up. I-I pick Simon's plan. Oh, wait for me! [Alvin] Hey, why don't I get to dial? [Panting] Because it's my quarter, and Theodore asked first! Oh! [Dinging] Don't worry, Theodore. As soon as Dave answers, our troubles are over! [Line Ringing] It's ringing! Oh, please answer, please answer, please answer! Theodore! Simon! Alvin! He's not home. [Gasps, Shrieks] We're all gonna die! [ Screaming, Grunting] Hey, look! Sornebody's still here, [Wolf Howling] As soon as I know they're okay, I'm gonna kill them! [Grunting, Mumbling] Alvin!

[Giggles] I think we will make it frightening enough. Don't you? Alvin! Fellas!

[Growling] Guys? Maybe they got locked in their dressing room. A-A-Alvin? Simon? [Screaming Hysterically] [Roaring] [Panting] [Moaning] Oh! My Teddy! - [Growling] - [Gasping] Theodore, let's go!

[Chuckles] Simon, don't you see? Even a monster wouldn't think we were stupid enough... to take a thrill ride in the middle of a life-or-death chase! Are we? Well, yeah. But he doesn't know that. Come on! [Growling] This is too creepy. I gotta get out of here. May I remind you that... there's an actual monster back there! Oh, yeah. I-I forgot. [Growling] [Sighs] This is so cool! I'm not happy. Hey, look! A phone. Maybe Dave's home by now. He could bring the cops and save us! [Beeping] No, Alvin! Wait! That's not a ph-- [Alvin On P.A.] Dave! You gotta come get us. There's a monster after us. And we're hiding in Dragonland! [Grunting] Huh? [Snarling] [Giggles] Well, so much for the hiding concept. Well, maybe the monster doesn't understand English. Boy, that little glass of yours... is always half full, isn't it? [Giggles] Yeah-- What little glass? [Growling] - [Screaming] - [Monster Growling] [Electricity Crackling] [Blubbering] [Growling] Yes! He missed! [Growling] [Dr. Frankenstein] Und add one ounce of sleeping potion-- Ah! Here, here! The tea is ready. I'm really worried about them. I understand. Ach! I have a little monster of mine own. - [Cackling] - I've looked everywhere. Calm yourself. Relax. Drink your tea. I-I can't relax. Not until I know the boys are okay. I am sure they are fine. They probably just found a little playmate. [Cackling] I-I gotta go. They're out there in the park somewhere. Wait! I, uh, have a map of the place. This will help. By the way, do you have both your kidneys? [Theodore] This isn't real. It's just a ride. This isn't real. It's just a ride. This isn't real! It's just a ride! [Theodore Screaming] [Screaming Together] [Monster Screaming] Tell me you don't love this baby. Quite impressive. [Growling] But I don't think we're going to like the way it ends. Oh! He really shouldn't be doing that. You're supposed to sit down... and keep your hands in the car at all times! Very helpful, Theodore. We wouldn't want him to get hurt... before he could kill us! [Wheels Screeching] [Alvin Continues] Hang on, guys. This is supposed to be the scariest part. [Monster Growls] Unless, of course, you have a hideous monster chasing you. [Monster Growling] - [Screaming] - [Screaming] Oh. I think I lost my appetite. [Growling] [Simon] Hey! Look at that. Doesn't he know it's just a-a ride? [Alvin] Apparently not. He thinks he's about to be eaten! - [Screeching] - [Growling, Grunting] Man! He's like cough syrup. He just won't go down. [Dave] Gee, I-I didn't realize how big the park is. Thanks for your hospitality, but I-I really better be going. You haven't... touched your tea. [Chuckles] - Perhaps something to make you sleep. - No, thanks. - [Blows] - I-I'm gonna check at home. Maybe they're already back there. - Very well. - Thanks again. Come again! [Dart Sticks] Und bring your kidneys-- Kiddies. I mean your kiddies. [Groans] [Snoring] [Growling] [Grunting] [Cracking] Oh, this isn't good. The potential energy is building up... far beyond the tolerances... for which this ride was engineered. What does that mean in English? I means unless he lets go something's going to give, and we're going to go way too... fast! [Screaming] [Screeching] Wow! Ah! We made it! We're alive! [Laughing] - I told you to trust me. - Oh, please! [Growling] [Snarling] [Dave] Uh, Theodore's always been so happy and sweet. Simon's the one with the glasses. [Chuckles] Funny, I didn't even know he needed them. A-And then of course, there's Alvin. [Chuckles] Oh, this was the time Alvin burned down the kitchen... making me a Father's Day breakfast. [Female Officer] Oh, y-yeah, I remember getting the call on that one. Oh, and here he is, just after he set the lab rats free at the school open house. There I am. [Chuckles] Oh! The one with the principal's hands around your neck? Uh-huh. She's got quite a grip for a woman her age. Well, Mr. Seville, we'll be in touch. You betcha. And don't worry, we'll do our best... to find your, uh, ah, "boys." Do you need any more information? Did I describe them okay? "Chipmunks with clothes on." Yeah, that ought to do it. As soon as we hear anything, we'll let you know-- - Dave! - Fellas! Oh! Ah, that's gotta hurt. [Dave] Thanks, officers. Uh, Dave? Dave? I-I can't breathe. - Oh, sorry. Now-- - We know, Dave. [Together] "Everybody on the couch." Where on Earth have you boys been? - Well, we-- - Why didn't you call? - We tried! - Didn't you stop to think how worried I must have been? - Yeah, but we-- - Missed your show and disappeared for hours! But Dave, you don't understand. There was this huge, scary monster, see? - And every-- - Yeah, I know. And it ate your homework. Huh? Uh, what homework? - Good one, Dave. But really, it was all-- - Alvin, please. I'm not in the mood to hear about monsters. Now, until you're ready to tell the truth, I don't want to hear a peep out of any of you. - But-- - [Clears Throat] Good night. I can't believe it. Dave didn't believe me. Yeah. Especially with your track record for honesty. Can I help it if I don't stifle my active imagination? [Whimpering] My Teddy! I-I must have dropped him. Well, we're not going back for him.

If he's such a big, lovable lug, then why was he trying to kill us? Perhaps he wasn't trying to kill us. Hello! If he'd caught us last night, he'd have cracked our little bodies... like this! [Gasps] Uh-oh. Actually, I-I think Alvin's right. Well, then may I ask why we're fixing him a 12-egg omelet? Well, 'cause I think he's got a really nice heart. He probably just acts like a monster 'cause everyone treats him like one. Uh-oh. [Glass Tinkling] Oh. [Woman] Hello! Yoo-hoo! Hello! Boys! [Gasps] [All Gasp] Miss Miller! Well, Miss Miller! So good to see you! - [Simon, Theodore Grunting] - But Dave decided to stay home today with his kiddies. What? Why, I turned down a lunch date with my vacuum repairman. Now, listen here, David. If you wanna stay home and play "monster" with your boys, then I expect a phone call. Shame on you, David. - Huh? Don't you give me an attitude, young man. [Sniffing] Ohh! What's burnin'? Well, thanks for stopping by, Miss Miller. Ta-ta! And sorry you can't stay for breakfast! Oh, was that close. [Groaning] [Alvin] Breakfast! [Gasps] Ohh! Oh, it's okay. Accidents happen. Anyone who's ever broken something, raise your hand. Huh? [Simon, Theadore] Alvin! I can't say that I have. - [Together] Alvin! - Okay, okay. Maybe once. [Silverware Clatters On Floor] Or twice.

You could lose your job. [Gasps] What have you heard? Nothing. N-Nothing, really. Well... They can't be late! I give you my word. Hey, Frankie, tomorrow I'm gonna teach you how to speak. [Grunting] And I'm gonna teach him how to skateboard. That'll be fun. [Beeping] [Gasps] Dinner! Yikes! We're late! We'd better get home before Dave does! [Theodore] Le
