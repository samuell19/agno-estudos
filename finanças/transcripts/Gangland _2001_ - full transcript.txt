They called it Armageddon. The leaders of our world, the so called civilised society, reduced to grovelling animals. It was a major nuclear war. I can remember the devastation, the destruction, cities turned to dust. And when the clouds settled, it was mass chaos. The system was all but broken down. Law enforcement agencies disabled. Lawlessness was breaking out into the streets and the most hardcore of criminals were starting to unite under the leadership of a man calling himself Lucifer. If that wasn't bad enough, the nuclear fallout caused a plague. A flesh eating disease that was spreading like wildfire. We assembled forces in Phoenix to try and take back our cities but the scourge over the land has grown strong. We had only one hope for the future. A scientist developed a formula for a cure for the plague. It was my mission to get to him. May 25, 2010 New York City Damn. Jesus! He's got the plague. I think she's still alive. What is this, man? So you copping free feels from dead bitches now? If you don't mind, Harris, okay? I'm checking for a pulse. Just because you got married don't mean everybody ... - Yo what the fuck? - He's got the plague, gotta kill him. Think about what you doing, man. This is a man, not an animal. We can take him to a rescue centre... Get the fuck off me, okay! We can't let this disease spread, it'll kill us all. Hey, man! Hey! Man, what the fuck's wrong with you? What the fuck, you're challenging my authority now? Oh excuse me, my brother. I didn't know they made you my senior officer now. Call for backup, Harris! I am the god of the wasteland. - Lucifer, I will make you proud. - What the fuck is this? I don't know but he must be high as fuck. Put your hands in the air and get on the ground now! You want to play with me, you fucking pigs? Yo dispatch we got a situation on the corner of Mont and Canal in China Town. I am invincible. Nothing can stop me! Send us some backup, please! This is Officer Harris at... I'm gonna kill you, you fucking pig! The fuck is your problem? - Listen... - Save that shit, man. You fucking losing it. This ain't the wild, wild west. And this ain't Mr Rogers' Neighbourhood, man, it's a living hell. Half the department's dead. We gotta do whatever we have to. Bullshit! We're here to restore order, not create more mayhem. - Listen... - Get your motherfucking hands off me! Stay the fuck away from me. I'm a take this girl back to headquarters and you can explain what you did to Sgt. Richards, cos I ain't involved in your motherfucking bullshit. Okay. Fuckin' pussy. This shit is real... this shit is real... Dunn! Dunn, what the hell happened? They ambushed us and they killed my partner. - What about them? - They were like that when I got here. I think she's alive. Drop your weapon! Down on the ground now! You got it all wrong, pig! You drop your fuckin' weapon! Last chance. Down. Guess again, pig! Look, look, look, nobody move, we can talk this out. Dunn, what the hell are you doing? Get back in line. We're all fighting the same war. Why don't we all put our guns down at the same time? Dunn, last chance, get back here now. I know these people, I can talk. Hold up. Alright, see, we can talk to these guys, okay? See? We got a deal. Come on! Bring it on! Latest reports coming in from New York City, not good news. Law enforcement agencies have been overrun in downtown New York City. Details still very sketchy at this moment. The one thing that is confirmed is law enforcement agencies clashed with gang members last night. Several New York City police officers have been killed and this must be grave, grave information for police authorities across the nation as they are getting ready for what is becoming a serious, serious threat. A police official for the NYC Law Department has blamed the state of the nation for the reason why police departments in the country are not running at full capacity. The City and the Mayor of New York have declared a state of emergency. Meanwhile, here in downtown Los Angeles, law authorities are warning anyone involved in any gang activity will be shot on sight. June 8, 2010 Atlanta, Georgia This is perfect. It's just the right constitution. Have a look. It's amazing. That concludes the equation for the vaccine. This will completely eradicate the plague. This could save the future of mankind. You bet. It's crucial we get this formula to Phoenix. I have a team of scientists waiting for us there. Phoenix is at least three days from here. News reports are saying gangs control most of the streets, do you think we can make it? We have to. If we control the vaccine, we can wipe out the gangs. If it gets in their hands... Get the family ready. Mary Anne? Ali? - Everything ready? - Well, yeah... - Dad, where are we going? - Phoenix, we have to meet some people there. Well are we gonna be gone long? We may be gone a little while, so make sure you have everything you need. Jonathan, take Ali to the car, help her with her things. I'll be right out. This is Mark Kriski reporting live in downtown Los Angeles. Reports are coming in that communications between Detroit, Philadelphia, New York and Boston have been knocked out a result of this phenomena. The National Guard and special police force tactics have been employed in downtown LA to control this epidemic, which now seems to be global. The President has declared a state of martial law for California. My God, John, this is getting serious. It's just a precaution, don't worry about it. I get a really bad feeling from this. Are you sure we're doing the right thing? We really have to get to Phoenix so I can work on this vaccine to stop the spread of this plague, honey. Do we have to go so fast? I don't have everything... Honey, I don't know how safe the streets are, how much longer the police can contain them. Besides, the plague hasn't spread to Phoenix. I just wish Alison didn't have to go through all this. Look, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, right? Yeah. Let's go. Jonathan? Dr. Adams, I've heard a lot about you. Don't you fuckin' move or they'll bash her pretty brains in. - Who are you? - My name is Lucifer. - What have you done with our daughter? - The little girl will be fine... as long as you cooperate with us. - What do you want from us? - I think you know what we want! You have a cure for the plague. I have a formula for the vaccine, it needs to be developed. Then you'll come with us and develop it. And if you fail, you'll never see the little girl again. June 26, 2010 Los Angeles, California So how's my baby doing? Ah man, 64's still up on blocks, I haven't touched her. - I swear. - No, man, I'm talking about Stephanie... and the kids. You been keeping an eye on my kids like a good uncle should? You know I have. Man, they're growing up like weeds, you gotta see them. Yeah, I bet. What's going on here? A lot has changed since you've been gone, man. Ganglanders have taken over everything, you gotta watch your back 24 hours a day, can't even walk in the damn streets and be safe anymore. Man, this used to be a neighbourhood. Yeah, well you're not in Kansas anymore. It's nothing like Phoenix though, huh? Tell me about Phoenix. For once military intelligence was right. Looks like we're all gonna relocate there. We gotta get mom and dad and Stephie and the kids together and get there as soon as possible. No! Shit! See if it'll turn over. Nothing? It's alright, I'll pop the hood. Relax. Yo, Derek, want to know about ganglanders? We're about to find out, bro. Just relax. How you doing? - A little car trouble? - Yeah, y'know. I hate it when that happens. Come on, man, go easy. We don't want any trouble with you guys. Ohh they don't want any trouble with us guys. Hi, what's your name? - Where you going? - My little brother and I are just going home. - Shy boy, what's your name? - You're trying to go home? What gang you with? Gang? It's just my little brother and I, we're just trying to go home, man. We'll it's too fuckin' late! You're not going anywhere. What, pretty boy's not used to a dirty beautiful blonde? You got the dirty part right. - A smart ass, I like that. What are you doing? Get the fuck off me! Oh, we have one of these. So, what do we have here? A couple of pussies on our turf? Who's it gonna be? Let's take the big one back. I'm in the mood to kill something beautiful. No! The streets are pretty quiet right now but that wasn't the case last night during the early hours when rioting and vandalism broke out. The state has issued a 7pm curfew and that is helping the situation here. The National Guard has also been called out to aid local authorities which are greatly understaffed. Meanwhile, in NYC, the situation seems to be getting worse. Many local street gangs have banded together and are causing a major threat. Local authorities here in LA are monitoring gang activity. Police Chief Jack O'Connor reports there are no problems as of yet but they are closely watching many gangs and some of their members. Now the bad situation here is the communications. Communications have broken down between the National Guard and the police, and they're having problems communicating with each other. Now all local community leaders are urged to help out in this situation. If you can help out, please contact your local police department. Can you hear me? You killed my brother! He had nothing to do with this! Nothing! You just want to kill everything that's good! But I've got news for you: we're gonna win! We're gonna destroy you! You guys are vampires, a bunch of disgusting, low-life animals! You hear me? Can you hear me? When I get a hold of you guys I swear I'm gonna kill you! Every last one of you! Hey... Hey... What? You want a chance to kill everybody? Stay quiet. Who the fuck are you? I'm getting out of here today. If you keep quiet, I'll take you with me. Yeah, how you gonna do that? Every day they take two of us out for execution. We're next. I'll make my move, then you make yours. Be patient. That I can do. Good. Hey, fellas, you know this guy's crazy? Let's go. Hey, fuck this asshole. You wanna do some real damage, come with me. Do you know what time it is? Show time! Hello, girly girls. Which one? No, please don't! No! Please! Please! Hey, I thought you said we had some place to go. Come on. Get the fuck up! Where the fuck are the prisoners? Lucifer's gonna fucking kill me when he finds out about this. Where the fuck were you? - I was... - Shut up, let's go! Come on. Fuck! There. Your highness, the prisoners have escaped. What? The prisoners have escaped! Fool! You show weakness. I want you to capture them and bring Jared to me. The other one you can kill. The fuck do you care about him for anyway? You dare question me? Now go, and don't fuck it up. Up until this point, things have been pretty quiet in downtown LA but there's a couple of gang members gathering over there. This looks like trouble. I don't see any police authorities in the area at all. This is not a safe situation, we're going back to you, we're gonna break right now. Okay, Sam, let's get out of here. Come on, let's get... Sam, cut! Get out... Hey, I really want to thank you for bringing me out of there with you tonight. - Don't mention it. - No, man, hear me out. Listen. Those guys, they killed my brother right in front of me. Cold blood, y'know? Cut him, tortured him. I vowed right then and there I was gonna kill every one of those bastards. Really, how you gonna do that? What's your fuckin' deal, man? My deal is I wanna find some gas and get some rest. - So where are we going? - You'll find out when we get there. Hey, listen, Jared. I want to know what you're up to. You're going to have to trust me. Trust is something you gotta earn from me. I got you out, didn't I? - Yeah, I know, but listen, they're off balance right now... You know what, save your energy, you're gonna need it. Let go of me. - This better be good. - I found this one outside. Nice. Turn her around. Nice ass. She smells. It's okay. Such a strong man you are. Is it the strength you admire? If I were a peasant you know you wouldn't be here. You could never be a peasant. You know why I could never be a peasant? Because I take what I want. Clean her up, I'll have her later. Anika! We gotta go, we gotta get out of here! Where are we? Listen to me. You gotta calm down. You have to follow my lead and then we'll get out of here alive, okay? - Let's run! - Be quiet, I'm going to take care of you. The locations appearing at the bottom of the screen are emergency shelters located throughout the LA area. Authorities are urging citizens not to occupy private residences no matter how secure they may seem. Hey, girls. Hi. Give daddy a hug. Come here you. Hi, Jared. - It's getting late, we should go inside. - Okay, I'm almost done. Sweetheart, you know the rules, it's not safe. - Please. - Finish tomorrow. Come on. Mindy? Mindy? Mindy! No! You okay, man? Sounds like you had a bad dream. Yeah, I know how you feel. Happens to me sometimes. Man... Looks like we've been asleep about five hours. I don't know how long we can go on fighting these guys but I'll tell you something. I hope when it's all over, we've still got Phoenix to get back to. Rescue units are reporting a high incidence of the Ebola outbreak. This has been linked to the plague which has stricken the city as a result of the nuclear fallout. Now this disease has the same characteristics as the flesh-eating disease originating from South Africa. Medical authorities are urging everyone and anyone to avoid coming in contact with anyone showing symptoms of the Ebola outbreak. And if you do have these symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately. Adams! You startled me, I didn't hear you coming in. Fuck that, how's it coming? Well, as you know, these things do take time. I don't have time. Please, a few more tests. Every minute that goes by, my people die. I assure you, it won't be much longer. This is a very intricate process. I have very thin patience, Adams. You wouldn't want me to lose it, would you? Please, a little more time. How much time do you think your family has? You do want to see them again, don't you? Oh man, this is beautiful! This is just what I need. I wouldn't drink that if I was you. - The ducks look fine. - You're not a duck. It's contaminated. You'd die before you know it. Oh that's just great. So what, I'm supposed to die of dehydration? The plague? I'm so sick of this shit. I know where there's water but we're gonna have to fight for it. Right about now I'd kill for it. What's this? Easy, easy. We're not here to hurt you. Great, now we've got three mouths to feed. Mindy? No! The fugitives have been spotted heading west from the lake. How could that be? Those motherfuckers are mine. I will bring you his head this time. I give you my word. Your word? Your word is your honour. Honour is all a man has. May your new life be a sanctuary of prosperity. Bless the blade that slices you. I will not fail you this time, Lucifer. Failure? Failure, Damian, leads to death. Alright, I'll go in the front, you take the back. You go over that way. What the? Come on! Damn it! We owe you one for back there. You don't owe me anything. And I don't owe you anything. What's your name? - Alexis. - I'm Jared. Derek. They killed my sister. I'm sorry. Ow, that hurts. I know, just another second. How you feeling? Well, every day I'm getting worse. How long are you gonna be gone? What do you mean? You're coming with me. I can't, I don't have the strength. Sorry, Angie, you don't have a choice. No one can stay here anymore. What's your problem, Alexis? Why can't I stay here? They dropped the bomb, the war is over. No, the war has just begun. Well, not for me, I'm dying. You're not dead yet. Car, go. Alexis... Alexis, look. I know you've always liked this necklace that dad gave to mom, since you were his favourite. Yeah, and you were mom's. I know but you're all I've got and I really want you to have it. Thanks. The hell's that? No! No! They killed my brother too. What has this fucking world become? Hell and their leader's name is Lucifer. Yeah. Its been a pleasure. You still coming? - Yeah, you know I am. - Where? We have a job to do. What kind of a job? We're breaking into Lucifer's headquarters. He's captured a scientist who's working on a cure for the plague. We're gonna get that scientist and that cure back to Phoenix. So we can save lives, right? - Right. - I want to help you. Please just let me come with you. What do you think? I mean, we can't leave her here. She saved our ass once. You're in. Let's go. You have some information for me? They broke into the food warehouse. They have a female with them. I want you to capture them all and bring them to me. It is imperative that we catch these peasants. They're different, they're up to something. If you fail me, I'll have to do it myself, then I'll have to kill you. Man, why the fuck do you have to talk to me like that? We're family. That's the only reason you're still alive. - What is this? - This... is our salvation. Oh hey, I've heard of these. Where did you get this, Jared? It's a collection I made during the war. Are there any more left? This is the last one. Some short-sighted politicians felt they were so dangerous they would lead to the end of mankind. What are you guys talking about? Bombs don't kill people, people kill people. And this little fucker makes the old Patriot missile look like a fire cracker. - Where did you serve? - I served up in Sacramento. Old guts and glory Commander Shields. Yeah, he was the first one to die. Never saw it coming. - Where did you serve? - Ninth Battalion. I was a lieutenant serving under Commander Edwards. How did you end up here? After they dropped the bomb, I came down here looking for my sister in Los Angeles. All communication was down. Nobody knew the gangs had taken over the cities. We're wasting time. Help me here. Look, I know where they're located. All we have to do is go in and get the doctor, and then kill their leader, Lucifer. You expect us to do all that with only these? And this. I'd still feel safer with the bomb. Where's that damn Elisha with my food? Would you like me to check on her for you, my lord? No, you keep doing what you're doing, I'll deal with her. What took you so long? - I'm so sorry, my lord... - I don't want to hear your excuses. When I give you an order I expect you to carry it out expediently. No, don't, Lucifer. Lucifer, don't! No! You, I took you in after finding you half-dead in a dumpster, raped and sodomised by your own peasant family. And if you betray me, you also will feel my wrath. You told me you'd get us out of here. How much longer? Soon, I promise. This is the last time he's gonna do this. There it is. Let's do this as quietly and as quickly as possible. If anything goes wrong, kill that fucker with the red eyes. - Quiet, dignity and grace. - I'm impressed, Derek. How's the good doctor doing this evening? I hope you have something ready for me, Dr. Adams. - Almost. - What do you mean almost? I need this to incubate for 24 hours. 24 hours? It should have been done by now. We had a deal. Remember your family? - It needs to ferment. -So... in 24 hours I'll have my cure to the plague. I will be invincible. I will be God! I have a little pet project I've been working on I wanna show you. 24 hours. You'll be the first to see my secret weapon. - What is it? - The perfect fighting machine. It has been my little pet project. I took DNA from all the top fighters and created one super fighter. I call him Hellion. What's that? A mixture of the highest potency steroids. We've been pumping them into his body the entire growth. For perfect muscular structure. My creation is alive! - You ready? - Ahuh. They've invaded the compound. So, these peasants want to play games. Well, let the games begin! Dr. Adams? Yes, I'm Dr. Adams. - I'm here to get you out. - Who are you? I'm the man that's gonna take you to your family. Doctor, stay close. Let him go! Come on! Damn, I can't believe we left him there. - Derek... Man, we ran away like a bunch of cowards. Derek, there was nothing we could do. They would have mowed us down right then and there. Yeah, well maybe we would have been better off. For all we know, Jared's dead already. I don't think so. They would have shot him on the spot. I gotta go back there. It won't do anybody any good if you go back and get yourself killed. So what do we do? Just wait around here for them to deliver his head to us on a platter? No, we hit them with all the fire power we've got! You really think that could work? It has to. It's our only hope. Alexis, I really gotta go this alone. I don't think it's a good for you to go back there. Look, Jared saved my life, I owe him that much. But if anything should happen to me, I want you to at least have a running chance. There's no way you're gonna go at this alone. I owe it to my sister. I want that son of a bitch dead. Hey! You remember me? How could I forget you? Aren't you the one with that pretty little wife? Aren't you the one that killed her? Very courageous. Took a lot of balls, didn't it? It's gonna take a lot less balls to kill you though. Maybe I'll kill you. Oh really? And just how do you think you're gonna do that? Have you seen yourself lately? Why don't you think about that for a while. Y'know, there's gotta be some station out there still broadcasting, I just gotta find it. The President has announced a state of emergency for California. The gang that originated in New York has invaded Los Angeles. Authorities report that the gang, which is known for its enormous numbers, have taken up headquarters in Van Nuys. Police are urging citizens to arm themselves and lock themselves in their homes. Reports of civilians being held prisoner and getting executed by the gang are believed to be accurate. God, it's really happening everywhere. We gotta get Jared outta there. And we gotta get the cure for the plague back to the proper authorities. That's our only hope of ending this. - ?What's your plan? - Wait till nightfall, we'll go back in. That's your plan? Yeah. Well we can't go in through the front of the compound. There's too many of them. So what do we do? Well... how about if we cut through the woods here? And sneak in the back, like this. It's gonna take at least a day to get there. Not if we light a fire under our ass. We'll be there by nightfall. Yeah, well let's hope we're not too late. Yeah. Alexis... I really want you to consider not coming with me on this. I am your only chance of getting through this, you schmuck! I'm a better shot than you. I'm faster than you. And what I lack in brute strength, I totally make up for in speed and agility. There is so much on the line here. You've got one shot. That's it. You need me. Yeah, I guess I know when I'm beat. You know something, you might end up getting a medal out of this. Yeah, if we live through it. Hopefully this will improve our chances. Oh, the equalizer. I like the way you think. Derek... There's something else we have to discuss. - If we can't go... -I'm listening. - If we should fail with this mission... - We can't fail with this mission. If we fail, I say we detonate the bomb. What about the cure for the plague? It's better if no-one has it than those animals having control over it. Yeah, I guess you're right. I never thought you'd be talking me into a suicide mission. Don't think of it like that, Derek. Just don't think of failing. It's not even in my head, okay? Besides, we've got guardian angels watching over us. Now shine up your halo and let's go. Enough! Lower him! I'm tired of hearing the bitch whine. Who sent you here? Don't make me keep torturing you. - Fuck you. - What did you say? - I can't hear you. - Fuck you. Fuck me? Why don't you hang out, think about it for a while. I'm sure I can come up with some way to help you with your fucking memory. Whip the bitch. We've just got one more hill to go over. It'll be alright, come on. You know, Alexis, you were right. But don't worry about it, we'll get Jared out of there. Watch your step. Yeah, alright. I think it was down at the bottom of this trail. Alright, wait, hold on. Yeah, alright. We gotta cut this way. Yeah. Right down here. - Who are you? - Never mind, let's get out of here. Going somewhere, punk? How's this? - I bet that hurt. - You may need this. - Why are you helping me? - When you broke out of prison, you broke me out to. Now we are even. You can't run from us! Come on! Hey, it's not that much further, Alexis. You said that three hours ago. Yeah, I know. Wait, did you hear something? I didn't hear anything? Hold on a second. I really don't think it's anything, Derek. Sweet mother of God. Bitch. - You okay? - Yeah. Time's up, Adams. Remember our deal. The cure for my family. The cure, Adams. You move, you die. Go ahead, fucker, pull the trigger. Then there'll be a hundred guys all over you in 10 seconds flat. You know what, you're right. Let's move. Derek! Alright, big guy. Go easy now. Easy there, kemosabe. Look, this is just between you and me, right? See, no gun. Just between you and me, right? Let's get Jared! You must go after them, Damien. Take as many men as you need. He holds the cure to the plague, our key to the future! - Alright, let's get out of here, over the fence. - There's Jared. Let's finish this off. Hey, Jared, shove this up their ass. With pleasure. Your family's behind this door. I need something to get it open. Here, use this for leverage. Dad! Are you okay? I didn't know that we'd ever see you again. - They harm you in any way? - No, we're okay. - Ali, are you okay? - Yeah, dad, I'm okay, just a little scared. Okay. Hey, I can't thank you enough. It's an honour to be of service to a man like yourself. Well I'm flattered but where do you go from here? They're all going to meet in New Phoenix. We can start to rebuild there. Yes, rebuild. That man who rescued me, what was his name? - His name is Jared. - Jared, a man of courage. Ladies, let's go. We gotta get out of here. Follow me. I guess we're safe here for the time being. You really think it's over now? I hope so. Well a lot of those assholes are still out there. But they're much less of a threat without Lucifer. Good, I'm getting kinda tired of saving your ass. Those bastards deserved what they got. Yeah, but still, I would've felt a lot better if I saw Damien and Lucifer's dead bodies. Yeah, well let's just hope they didn't survive the explosion. I've gotta get the serum back to Phoenix, replicate it, so people will just stop dying. Yeah, well good luck to you. Me, I gotta get back to the Valley. I've got a '64 up on blocks, a beautiful wife, two gorgeous little babies, and they got dinner waiting for me. - Lucky you - Yeah. Hey, you might want to rest up, travel in the morning. Alright. What about you? - What about your plans? - I don't have any. My sister was all I had left. - Husband? - No. Boyfriend? I lost everything after they dropped the bomb. I know the feeling. - Mindy! - No! What time is it? Time to get going. Where you headed? I'm going with you? How about you? Well, I'd tag along, watch your backs, but I figure I taught you guys well enough. This is where we're gonna part company. There's still ganglanders out there so be careful. I'll be fine. You sure you can't come to Phoenix with us? Yeah, I gotta get back. I gotta tell my family what happened to Joey. There might be some transportation out the back. See what you can use. Thanks. You'll save the world without us, huh? Yeah, well at least my little part of it anyway. You guys, don't go getting sappy on me now. You don't need my help getting to Phoenix. I'd just wind up being the bus driver. He's gone. Shit. Come on. - Find something you can use. - Like what? Anything. Come on, go! Hey, asshole! Go! Go! Go! How are you feeling? Like shit. He felt like a brother. What's that? They call it a message in a bottle. What's the message? The plague kills. It was already killing my sister before they killed her. Why are you holding onto it? If something happens to the doctor, at least we have an isolated strain to analyse. - Very smart. - It's a progressive disease. At this point, one drop of this blood would kill you instantly. Don't you think it's dangerous to have the plague strapped to your back? I'm not afraid. I've got my sister watching me. Okay. The car has probably cooled down by now. We should get going. Nice. Nice and creepy. You really want to sleep here? Can you think of a better place? - Yeah, Hawaii. - I wish. Wait, was that? - Maybe a ghost. - Don't fuck with me, Jared. Hey, we got lucky. I could use a swig of this, how about you? Sure. Thanks. Nice. We should sleep in shifts. You first. Sweet dreams. Jared? Jared? Jared? Please don't hurt me. Jared? - Jared? - It's alright, I'm here. What happened? Ever since this whole thing started, its just been one nightmare after another. Tell me about it. You right? Yeah, I think we should get out of here. I think you're right. Lets move. Motherfucker! Now you're gonna know what it feels like to die. I stopped feeling a long time ago. Oh shit! The happy couple. Jesus Christ. Did you really think you were gonna get rid of me that easy? Well, we gave it the old college try. What do you say we make a deal? - What kind of deal would that be? - You know what I want. I want the cure. I will grant safe passage for you and your girlfriend. There's no need for any more violence. Just give me what I want and walk away. Do we have a second choice? Yeah, your second choice is I kill you both right now. Well, that's a tough decision. We either give you the future and jeopardise the future of mankind. Or we don't give you the cure and jeopardise our future. You're making it tough. Honey, can you help me out with this one? Why don't I make it easy for you? I'm gonna count to three and if I don't have the cure, I'll kill her. One. Two. Three. No, don't! I'll give you what you want. Down on your fucking knees. Hands behind your head. Give it to me. Now! You fools. Bless the gun that kills you. You fucked up. Looks like he got the message. Thank you. You're welcome. - Can we go now? - Absolutely. Ready? Yeah, in a second. This was my sister's. Let me see your ring for a second. Let's go to Phoenix. Subs by SickSadWorld @ KG 2022
