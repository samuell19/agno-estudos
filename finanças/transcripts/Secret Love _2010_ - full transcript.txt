Who is this? It's me... I think you've got the wrong number. It's... me... Jin-woo. You're here! Where the hell have you been? Oh my God! Who would've guessed that a miracle could happen here! You told me to call you right away if he woke up. But I didn't know your number. If only I had it sooner... Where have you been all this time? You weren't home nor at the hospital. Excuse my late introduction. I'm Jin-ho, Jin-woo's brother. Jin-woo. Yeon... Jin-woo. Relax your arm and take it slow. A little more. The next piece is by the most influential Italian composer, Giuseppe Verdi's DON CARLOS. And it tells the story about a man who fell in love with a woman who was betrothed to his brother. Let's listen. Jin-ho. - Yes, Jin-woo? - Give me your hand. I'm so glad that you're here. This is why it's great to have a brother. After I'm discharged, shall we go on a trip together, just three of us? You two have been through a lot because of me. Let's think about it when you're better. Slowly, right foot, left foot. Try not to go too fast. Slowly now. Slowly now. You're doing well. That's good. It's been a long time. It was you. Is she Jin-woo's woman? Is it really that important to you? Is it? I'm a bastard, right? The rehab exercise isn't over yet, is it? Um, no. Not yet. No, he was on his way up just now. You're so naive. There's no such thing as unconditional love. But she's been so consistent. Do you know what I think? It's because of the jealousy. I still can't believe she did that. Hey! Think about it. Imagine if your wife was having an affair with your own twin brother. Wouldn't you wake up? Poor guy. Jealousy is scarier than a miracle. Would you please bring me today's newspaper to my room? Huh? Sure. Jin-woo... Don't you think it's too soon to leave the hospital? It's okay. How does it feel? Coming home... We'll have to change the wallpaper. Yeon. You know I hate this colour. I'm going to have some water. Yeon! Yes? The man... who followed the woman... What happened next? It looks like you haven't cut your hair for a while. Any style you'd like to try? Or you could try a trendy look. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HIM? I thought you hated us having the same hairstyle. Isn't your style what's hot these days? I've been out for so long, I didn't know what was trendy. 0315. I saved it with our birthday so it's easy to remember. Jin-ho. Do you remember playing the game where we exchanged roles? When you came to Korea a few years ago, You went hiking instead of me 'cause I had the flu. You told me that you scored with some woman. What do you mean? You tied her laces and told her that it was fate. Have you forgotten already? She's even in my wedding video. After that, she came to me and told me that she loves me. Really? I couldn't tell. If she loved me, or you. I couldn't make it out. Why are you bringing it up all of a sudden? I did it because of you. I wanted you to meet some girls and... Jin-ho. We promised never to play that kind of game again! Didn't we? You agreed that it's dangerous to play that game! Right? I did. We're too old for playing games. As long as that's clear. And another thing. I think Yeon's feeling a bit uneasy around us. Having two identical men walking around in the same place. Do you like this place? Jin... ho? You're back. I guess I've lost some weight. None of my clothes seem to fit. I think I look alright in this style. What do you think? Why do you have to wear your brother's clothes? YEON, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT I LIKE MORE THAN MOUNTAIN MAYBE I WON'T GIVE THIS TO YOU 'CAUSE IT'S TOO CHEESEY I'll leave your towel and underwear here. Could you scrub my back? That day, when you saved me in the mountain. Your back smelled like some kinds of soap fragrance. I didn't know a man could smell the way that you did that day. Come out, Jin-ho. The water's getting cold. What did you just call me? What? I called you Jin-woo. Who? Hello, I'm calling from the Seaworld. Thank you, come again. Jin-ho, it's me. I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore. I came to tell you this... I'm sorry. I missed you so much. That river... Is it true that it can make love happen? I'm a bad woman, aren't I? Please vanish me away. Let me see. Jin-woo... Jin-ho... Yeon... Mom, are you out of your mind? Let's not do this right now. Pack your bags. - Let's go to my place. - I don't want to go. - Come on, mom. - I won't C'mon. Let's go to my place. Why does it have to be so difficult to love someone? Mom, he's a priest. It's not the priest that I love. The man I love just happens to be a priest. Why must you do this to me too? Why... YOU HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE. Jin-woo, now that you're back, I'll be returning to my own life. I'm sorry for leaving so suddenly. Take care of yourself. Make your wife happy. Bye. Jin-woo? I just got your message. You won't be back for a few years. So we should go to see mom and dad. Are you sure? You're not fully recovered yet. Well, you'll be with me, so it's okay. It's been a long time since I visited them. You haven't visited them yet, have you? I'll see you then. 3 people have gone missing so far. Approximately 2000 houses were damaged in torrential rains. The amount of damage is expected to increase. The storm will get worse in the afternoon with strong winds. There's someone here for you, miss. Alright. Are you sure that Jin-ho is your true love? You don't have to hide it, just tell me. Are you still wasting your time looking for your soul mate? Don't mock me. So, you still believe it's important. Whether he's your soul mate or not. Do you think that I don't know? You think you do? Then how come you're still wandering about in a dream after making such a big mistake? Big... I never knew that I would have to carry you again. I'm a bastard, right? Mistake! She's pretty, isn't she? I met her in the mountain. I wish you could come to my wedding. Come on. Let's move down quickly. There's going to be a heavy rain soon. Jin-woo, where are you going? Jin-woo. Which one of us saved Yeon? Who saved Yeon on this mountain? Why did you do it? Why did you have to lie, and steal my wife from me? This picture hanging in her car. She said the little boy looked like her soul-mate. It's because that boy was me. You think that gave you the right? Son of a bitch. When I saw her at the hospital, she looked like a wilted flower. It hurt to see her like that. I wanted to make her feel alive again. To make her feel alive again? Why don't you admit that you just wanted to fuck my wife! I'm sorry, Jin-woo. I'm sorry. Don't flatter yourself! She only accepted you because you look like me. As long as you have my face whatever she felt was not love. She never loved you, you bastard. You hated the fact that you had a twin brother enough to make you want to hide my existence from Yeon. It would have been better if we were the same person. Let's go down. Jin-woo, where are you going? Let's just go. It's pouring down. Let's go. Let's just go. Do you think I'll give in? - You can leave! - No! I'm not leaving you. Where are you going? Let's just go down. Stop it and let's just go. Stop, Jin-woo... Please. Don't follow me. Jin-woo. Take care of her. Jin-woo! No! Jin-woo! Jin-woo! Jin-ho! Jin-woo! Jin-ho! Anyway, I'll live happily with the woman I love and my brother forever and ever. Thank you. I'm here. Don't think I should be bossed around by a bakery owner. I sell sandwiches. Not bread. Whatever, they're the same to me. Is the manuscript ready? Do you even have time to write? Gas bills, health insurance. You should check your mail. Another parking ticket? What's this? A love letter? I'm not kidding. Look. Which one of us did you really love? The man I loved... Was you... It was you...
