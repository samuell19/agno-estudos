(door slamming) (dog barking) Mom: Ben, it's nearly eight o'clock, honey. - Are you in bed? - (footsteps approaching) Okay, Mom. (dog barking) - I'm on the bed. - Not on, in. As in, you are "in" trouble, mister. But Mom, I have to finish this drawing. Ben: It's a king. That's terrific. And who's that little guy? Ben: Uh... kind of a flying thing. I drew 'em on the same paper 'cause they're pals. - Well, pal... - (Ben laughing) You're my flying thing and you're going right into bed. You can color more tomorrow. Mmm, after we clean up this room. Which means you need to feed the Trashosaur. (roaring) Mom: Lights out, little guy. - Mom: I love you. - I love you too, Mom. (yawning) Good night, honey. (sighing) (sighs) Where am I? How did I get here? (whimpering) It's pretty dark. Nothing to be afraid of. I hope. (voice muttering) (gasping) Oh, it's the gang. They must be nearby. (all chattering) Up and at 'em, slowpokes. We only got till morning. We gotta be back before Ben wakes up, and one minute's gone already. Come on, we're burnin' moonlight! - (all yawning) - (chattering) Keep it down, you rusty wagon wheels. You'll wake the young 'un. Would you look what Ben colored with me today. A green dog. Usually he just uses me for grass, - or leaves. - That is one groovy puppy. Blue: You know, last week, Ben used me to color an elephant. A blue elephant. Ha! Kid sure is creative. All he ever uses me for is night. But nighttime is party time. And another thing: he never colors inside the lines. Is it too much to ask for my chroma and pigmentation not to be spread around haphazardly? He colors like a six-year-old. Uh, he is a six-year-old. Once in awhile, I'm an outline. (whistling) Hey! What's it take to get some help around this joint? Zam. What are you doing up there? I don't know, what are you doing down there? Ben must have left her there before he went to bed. - Hello. - Don't flip your lid, Red. I got you covered. (laughs) (grunting) Well, it's about time. Been up there all day. Well, I thought it was a perfect catch. I probably would have dropped her. - Tangerine. - (giggling) Hello. - Periwinkle. I'm here. Oh, did he see me? - I've... I've been here. - Baby blue? - (crying) - Orange? Huh? Juicy. - White. - Did you see? Did you, Brown? Ben reached for me today. Well, almost reached for me, but still... I saw it, White, and you know, pretty soon Ben's gonna draw a holiday card. Now who do you think he's gonna use for snow? Me! Gee, thanks, Brown. - Tutti Frutti? - (laughing) Refried Bean. (farting) Aw, come on! All right, now, let's see here. Yella? Yella? Yella! She's probably hiding in a corner somewhere. (scoffs) Scared stiff, as usual. (sighing) Almost there. Just a few more steps. Oh! Excuse me, I... (shouting) (screaming) Help! - (panting) - Whoa! Shh. You'll wake the kid. Where's the fire? Monster... under bed. Almost... almost got me. A monster? At this time of year? It'll probably devour us all. - (gasping) - A sock monkey? Oh. (chuckling nervously) - Silly me. - Forget about it, Yellow. Never trust a toy made from old laundry. And look at his smile. Very insincere. (stretching) - (beeping) - Oh! Time flies, fellas. We better head back. Well, hold up there, you young whippersnappers. Always with the hippity- hop music you have now. Why, back in my day, crayons came four in a box, and none of these fancy waxes neither. We were mostly made of charcoal and mud. (sighing) Those were the days. Don't let it fracture you, Yellow. Everyone gets scared sometimes. You don't. (laughing) Hey, come on. I know how to cheer you up. Some extreme fun. No, no. Nothing with an "extreme" in front of it. You go on ahead. - You sure? - (whimpering) - (snapping fingers) - Ha! (whooping) (sighing) What am I always so afraid of everything? You sure looked like a monster. I had every reason to be scared. It's not like I jump at every little... - (screaming) - (panting) - Oh, it's just... - (thudding) - (gasping) - (whirring, roaring) Oh! Eee! - (roaring) - (screaming) (all chattering) Navy blue? Aquamarine? Both: Aye aye, sir. Crayon-amo! - (grunting) - (laughing) Whoo! What a gas. It wasn't me. - (groaning softly) - (all gasping) Consarn it, Blue! You almost woke Ben up. Ooh. My bad. Time's a-wastin'. We better high-tail it. - Crayon 1: Okay, come on. - Crayon 2: Watch out. (all whooping) (Red giggling) I love it! (Green shouting) Blue: Look out below! Black: Please. Brown: Yee-haw! (all grunting) - Wait. - All: Huh? - Brown: Has anyone seen Yella? - (all grunting) (panting) Wait for me! I'm here, Brown. Brown? Blue? Red? Anyone? I'm still here, guys. With the drawings, and the... - (Trashosaur roaring) - dinosaur. Oh, no. (gasping) (gasping) (sighing) Deep breaths. - Find your happy place. - (footsteps) (growling) (Yellow yelling) Monster! - (shouting) - (growling) Get... get away from me! You... you... monster! - Monster? - (gasps) Now see here, we're hardly monsters. Just pigments of Ben's imagination. - Scribbles. - (growling) - Handsome scribbles. - (shouting) - Yellow: It has two heads! - Two heads? We should be so lucky. I'm his wingman. Probably because I have wings. (laughing) - The name is Nat. - You're a gnat? Not a gnat, Nat! I'm a flying thing. (clearing throat) Oh, and his best friend. Who is he? What is he? (singing fanfare) Allow me to introduce the Crown Prince of Chiaroscuro, the Head of the Colorwealth, the Archduke of Saturation, the one and only, His Royal Poobah... King Scrawl. (clears throat) What do you want from me? Obviously. You're a crayon. We're sketches. What do I have to do, draw you a picture? - (laughing) - Hmm. Look, we just need a little color. I was thinking of something in a paisley. Wha... what? By myself? Um, I'm not supposed to color strangers. And besides, my tip is all worn out... Well, what about all your friends? Can't they give us some color? They're all gone. See? - (Scrawl murmuring) - Gone? Where? Through the secret door to Color City, where crayons live. (gasping) Hmm? Hmm... All the crayons? Secret door? - Hmm! - You're right, boss. That certainly looks like a secret door. That's not the secret door. And anyway, only crayons are allowed in Color City. (growling) (grunting) - Hmm? - Maybe we need to knock. - Hmm! - (music notes sounding) Oh, there's a doorbell! This must be the place. But that really isn't the way to Color City. Don't listen to her, boss. She's just trying to trick us. Hmm... What about this doohickey? Hmm? Hmm. (music playing) - Uh-oh. - (both shouting) - (Trashosaur roaring) - (Nat yelling) (gasping) Hmm. Hmm? Nat: Get me out of here! Nat: Please let me out! I don't like small places. Nat: I've never even been to Rhode Island. - (roaring) - (Nat shouting) Thanks, Your Royal Stompiness. Hey. Where's Little Miss Yellow? (distant yells) (shouting) - (grunting) - (bell tolling) (gasping) I'm home. (indistinct chatter) (gasping) (sighing) Color City! I... I made it. Yay! Ah. (bell tolling) - Hey, Yellow, how you doing? - Hi, Yellow. - Yellow! Where you been? - We were worried. - I assumed the worst. - There's a shock. You know, Brown was about to organize a search party. Or, as I think he put it, (stammering) a posse. It was awful. I was attacked. - What? - By a big, huge, ginormous... Sock monkey? A rubber ducky? Wave of panic. Yeah, that's it. I was scared because I was all alone. Well, at least it wasn't a monster this time. - (Red chuckling) - And just look at your tip. Blunt as blunt can be. You could use a little trip to the spa. Good idea, Blue. White: You'll be as good as new in no time, you'll see. Green: Do we have an appointment? Ma cherie, hello. What happened to you? My gentle, blushing flower. I had an, um... episode? Surprise, surprise, she got left behind in Ben's room. I'm such a klutz. (gasping) Left behind?! But anything could have happened. You could have been hurt. Oh. (gasps) Or broken, no? Broken? I... Uh, no. Anything but that. (groaning) Aiee! Look at your tip! It's all flat and horrible. Alors, we fix you in a jiffy. Oui? See you at the beach, Yellow. - (White humming) - But not so fast. You do not need the spa. But Madame Pink, I was used today. What did you color? - Oh, Ben used me to draw... - Hmm? - A sheet of paper. - A sheet of paper. What? No. Oh, yes! Yes, uh- huh. - Hmm. - I mean, a cloud. - A cloud? - No. Yes! - Fruit! - White fruit? Hmm? No. Yes. An apple. Banana? - An orange! - Say what? How many times must we go through this? I know you have not been used. Please. I've never even been in the spa. Someday you will. But not today. (White muttering) Someday soon, I hope. Coloring is overrated. Are you kidding? Coloring is what we do. I just know I'll be useful someday. I just have to be. (bubbling) (humming) Oh, hi! - (splashing) - (laughing) What does this mean, this, uh... sock monkey? Qu'est ce que c'est? It's kind of like a real monkey, but made out of socks. (exclaiming) Socks! - (shouting) - I know, right? I just wish... If only I was cool, like Blue. Or as strong as Red. Or even as organized as Green. They would have known how to deal with King Scrawl. King Who? What, what, what? Nothing. Ha. Oh,cherie, we are all special in our own way. We each get to be one color. Except for Tutti Frutti! Whoo hoo hoo! I can sing a rainbow! (singing) Oui. Except for her. Being yellow is a good thing, n'est ce pas? - I guess. - (Green clearing throat) Yellow. Yellow? Tick-tock, beach party. Oh, I almost forgot. I'm meeting my pals at the marina. Au revoir! (bell dinging) (indistinct chatter) - Hey there, Yellow. - Hello, dearie. - Hey, Yellow. - (bell dinging) Get off my lawn! Madame is right. Maybe I am special. - I can be anything I want. - (bell dinging) ♪With colors so bright ♪ ♪ Oh, it reminds me of Spring ♪ ♪ And ringing my bell just makes me want to sing ♪ ♪ The air is so rosy, so sparkly and light ♪ ♪ It's golden all day and deep purple at night ♪ ♪ Riding along makes me feel so happy ♪ ♪ The city is shining, its colors are snappy ♪ ♪ The sky is so blue and the buildings all gleam ♪ ♪ If I wasn't awake, I'd be in a dream ♪ ♪ Ring a little bell and off I go singing ♪ ♪The colors keep time to my bell's ding-a-linging ♪ ♪ A bright little tune I will sing from the start ♪ ♪ The song that I sing also rings in my heart ♪ ♪ When you are singing, your cares disappear ♪ ♪ And when you are ringing, it makes colors clear ♪ ♪ A red star is twinkling, there's green in the trees ♪ ♪ Blue is a whisper and white is the breeze ♪ ♪ Some hues are loud, and others are mellow ♪ ♪ I love them all, from magenta to yellow ♪ ♪ Colors are with us in moonglow or sun ♪ ♪ And singing about them is just so much fun ♪ ♪ Ring a little bell and off I go singing ♪ ♪ The colors keep time to my bell's ding-linging ♪ ♪ A bright little tune I will sing from the start ♪ ♪ The song that I sing also rings in my heart ♪ ♪ Ring a little bell Ring a little bell ♪ ♪ Ring a little bell ♪ ♪ The song that I sing also rings in my heart ♪ - (rumbling) - (shouting) - (whirring) - (gasping) - Scrawl: Mm- mmm. - Oh, no!

Yellow should be here any second. Red: Green, I'm starting to get worried about Yellow. - Oh? - (Yellow shouting)) She's seeing monsters everywhere. - (bell dinging) - (shouting) Yeah. I hope she hasn't snapped her cap. Girl's going all delusional on us. - (Scrawl growling) - Yikes! - Yikes? - (thudding) Yikes, man! (Yellow screaming) (all screaming) I'm going this way now! That's a big monster. He's crayon-napping Yellow! Somebody do something! Doesn't screaming and running in circles count? - I guess. - (White screaming) Hold it! All right, you varmint. As sheriff of this here city and on behalf of crayons everywhere, I order you to cease and desist any and all monster-related activities. - (feedback from speaker) - Uh, pronto. (gulls crying) After him! Charge! Oh, my goodness. Hold on, hold on! That doesn't look safe at all. Oh, Yellow! (slurping) (all shouting) Keep him in your sights! It's time for Plan A. (Yellow screaming) (all shouting) (all gasping) (all chattering) Put me down! Put me down! Put me down! Let me go! (gasps) (all gasping) (Yellow gasping) Don't let me go! Don't let me go! Don't let me go! Afraid of heights? Heights, crowds, germs, - the dark... - Okay, okay... vacuum cleaners, cats, bugs, sock monkeys... I get the picture! - And trees. - Trees? You're afraid of trees? They've got pointy branches! Well, their bark is worse than their bite, you know. (laughing) Oh, that was awesome! - Hmm... - Nat: I'm so funny. (whirring) Yee-haw! Plan A for areo-plane! (shouting) Help! Hang on! I'm comin' fer ya', Yella! Yee-haw! Whoa, Nellie! I got some sort of turkey on my tail! (Brown muttering) (exasperated grunting) - (screaming) - Hoo- doggies, I been hit! (all gasping) I got her! I got her! I got her! Gotcha! (all cheering) Incoming! Brown, are you all right? Uh, I think my saddle's sore. We must rush you to the hospital! Tout suite! Nat: Well, what do we do now, your Royal Clumsiness? (grunting) Scrawl: Hmm... (excited grunting) I gotcha. Why deal with this pain in the tail when we can go straight to the source? (grunting) Blue, you and Brown really saved my wrapper. Please. You're making me blush. And when I blush, I turn purple. What's so wrong with that? Did you see that? The monster was all... (roaring) And Yellow was all... (screeching) And we were all... (screaming) And it was horrible! Well, he's gone. Our troubles are over. I sure wish that were true. Lookee yonder. (bird calling) What does it mean? I'm araid our troubles are only just beginnin'. (microphone feedback) All right, all right, simmer down now, young 'uns. We've put our best minds to work on the sitch-e-ation. Professor Heliotrope from ColorTech University is here to make his report. Professor? Oh, now it's my turn to speak with the talking and the lips with the flapping and explaining. (clears throat) Hello, nice cowboy man. I'm not quite ready though with the screen for the light and the showing of the thing which is happening with... Oh! Where did everyone go? It's like a magic trick. (grunting) Oh, my glasses. There they are. Okay, well... Well, then. Lights, please and thank you, very nice. All right, the slide numbering one, please. Then slide the first, the premiere, yes. Thank you. Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes. Well, this represents the rainbow which comes down with all the color and the color falling into the lake, giving us the tinting and all the prettiness in the city, like I said, for living. Living and happy, smiling. Slide number two. The two is next to one and number four through... Thank you. And here we see the colorfall, through which the metamorphosis of the rain... Ooh, double rainbow! To the lake, to the lake, gives us the color, setting us apart from other art materials like ink blots, and lumps of clay and pencil lead, and what do they do with the pastels? The smudging. All right and the next slide. Oh, you're good at that. Thank you. Oh, and here I am at the beach last year having a wonderful vacation, it was so nice. They brought me the drink with the big thing in it - that stabbed me in the eye. - (laughing) I don't even know how that got in there. Okay, let's move along. Press the button. See, again, you're very good at this in the back. Look, now, there are... (growling) Drumroll and moment of seriousness. Here, you can clearly see my postulation: Limpidus non carborundum est. Uh, run that by us again, Professor. In English? What, you didn't get it the first time? All right, I'll do it again. Assuming the insertion of the Monster between the Rainbow and the Colorfall, he... It's very simple, actually. No color, removed. We become transparent. Transparent? You mean I'll lose my color? Well, everybody'll lose their color. And if we lose our color, we'll cease to exist. All: Huh? (feedback) Any questions? (all screaming) (all sobbing) (sighing) It figures. Whoa, whoa! Hold your horses. Folks, I ain't gonna sugarcoat it: we're up a crick without a paddle. I'll say! No Crayon I've ever heard of has traveled that far before. (all murmuring) Now Red, no need to get everyone more riled up than they already are. - Green, what time is it? - We have precisely five hours, fifty-eight minutes and twenty-seven seconds - before Ben wakes up. - All right, all right. We need ourselves some volunteers to go upriver and stop this scrawly sidewinder who's messin' with our color. - Who'll be first? - Huh. I'm in. Atta boy. Knew we could count on you. Anybody else? We each get to be one color. I'm tired of feeling useless. This is our chance. Always knew we'd end up on a perilous mission of doom. Both: We're in! Hey! Do I see another bold color in the house? (gasping) Green? Nice goin', Greenhorn! Brown: Someone's gotta keep track of time and keep things organized. (sighing) No big galoot is gonna steal my color. - I'm coming too! - Zam! This is gonna be one crazy voyage. Well, there's our posse. Unless there's another volunteer? We got room for one more. Not a lot of room. I have luggage! (all chattering) (sighing) (snoring) (muttering) Lawn, lawn... get off my lawn. Come on, boss. Almost there. (grunting) (gasps) Oh! Wee! It's so pretty. - I love it. - (grunting) I hope he's right about this color thing. Well, if you're ready, so am I, your Royal Tie-Dyediness. On your mark, get set. Color! Nat: Yeah! (both exclaiming) (Nat laughing) (gurgling) Ah, this is so much fun! (chortling) Hoo-ha, boss. We're in color! You think this is the right combination for me? I'm a sort of an autumn. I don't want to look too summer-y. Hmm? (grunting) Nat: Oh, he paled out a bit. Hmm. Well, that was disappointing. Just jumping in doesn't seem to do the trick. I guess it's only crayons that can color drawings like us. You know, decent, sophisticated, grown up. - Hard lines, handsome... - (softly growling) What's going on? What do you see? What's happening? Yes, I see, your Royal Plumbermeister! If we plug up the colorfall, the crayons will have to come here to unclog it, and then we can get them to color us! (horn blowing) (band playing) Avast me hearties! This be our vessel? Well, Green, it's good to see you came prepared. Oh, indeed, only the essentials. My cappuccino machine, my bunny slippers, - etcetera, etcetera. - (boinging) Huh! Hey, didn't you pack anything? We had to pack? No one told me. Did you pack anything? Only my sunny disposition. People, people, don't freak. I didn't bring anything either. Well, I hope you at least packed clean underwear. Of course! Six pairs. Plus two in case of accident. - (bell dinging) - Hello, everyone! Yellow, it's good to see ya. Cool, man! You're coming with us? No, no. I'm not going. This is just some things I thought you'd need. - It's the least I can do. - Nice job. Compass. Tent. Lantern. "Map of Scary Places." (stammering) It's a map. Hmm, very practical. And it's utilitarian, and it's pragmatic, too! Those are synonyms, I think. Brown: One word before ya depart. You're goin' where no crayon has ever gone before. I sure wish I was goin' with ya, but I'm a bit, uh, hog-tied. All I can do is wish ya luck and remind you not to be late, 'cause if you don't get back before Ben wakes up, you'll be lost forever. No Ben, no colorin', no nothin'. Heliotrope: Oh, yes, Inkdiana. I spoke at a seminar once there one time. They have a lovely convention center. Oh, yes, indeed! Very colorful! (gasping) No! The map! Heliotrope: Why don't you take that... - Here, Blue, you'll need this. - Oh, thanks, Yellow! What am I looking at here? Oh, Blue, that's the wrong side. Here, like this. (grunting) Ooh, a cotton blend! That's some quality rope, if I do say so myself. You really should only go for the quality ropes. And cables, and bungees. And anything else that falls in the line of string. - (horn blowing) - What the? Hey, I didn't say cast off, but, uh, cast off! Cast off? Wait! I'm not supposed to be here! (sniffing) Oh! Oh, they are so brave, n'est-ce pas? Braver than a armadillo crossin' the highway. (horn blowing) - Yellow! - (gasping) Up top! I'm glad you decided to come! Well, I didn't exactly decide to. Don't worry, it's gonna be fun! (sighing) - Isn't this exciting? - Exciting? We could get the wax peeled off our tips, our wrappers could get torn, or we might even get broken. Broken? Mommy. Huh. Whew. - This isn't too bad. - Mm-hmm. I can handle this.

I'd invite you to take a look, but it seems my ocular orb has become somewhat fastened to this contraption... Qu'est que c'est? He means his eye is stuck. (muttering, straining) Oh, thank you, nice Cowboy Man and Pink Lady. There must have been... (chuckling) suction created with the surface tension when my eyeball came in contact with the curvature of the eyepiece lens, causing the predicament that, with your application of continuous gyration and torque was finally broken, allowing me to esca... Ow! Glad we could help, Professor. - (Scrawly grunting) - Brown: Just what I feared. That varmint is blocking up the rainbow! Here take a look-see. Pink: Zut alors! A chroma-tastrophe. If this continues, we shall soon be mere silhouettes! I believe you are already starting to fade. And you don't have your usual rosy glow. Oh, well, this isn't my usual eyeball, but our heroes are coming to a bifurcation! (horn blowing) (gasps) Hey... Hey! Which way? (bird calling) - Hmm, let me see... - Green: Oh! We need to make a decision here. It says "Danger!" - Almost there. - Go left. - Left? - Right. - Right? You said left. - I meant correct. - Go left. - Left. You sure? - Right. - Right right? - Or correct right? - Right right! - Make up your mind! - Um, left! Okay, turning left! Oops... - Right. - Um... Okay. - Where are we? - According to the map, we're heading down the Scary Narrows. (stammering loudly) Rapids! - Hang on tight! - (Yellow gasping) What do we do now? We end up in Davy Jones's school supplies. (vomiting) Red: Oh, no. We have to stay inside the shore lines. Blue! Give the wheel to Green! - Me? - Him? He's the best at staying in the lines. (Red groaning) (all shouting) Blue: That's not cool! The lines are getting too close together! We'll never make it. We're doomed. (all moaning) (White coughing) (all groaning) White: I landed on my keys. Oh! I'm still in one piece! You dodged the whole thing! You saved us! Well, it only goes to show that sometimes, you just have to color outside the lines. Way to go, Green! Well, thank you, but I can't take all the credit. - It was Yellow's idea. - Huh? Black: It sure was. That was some fast thinking. (Red chuckling) Uh, Green, I think you forgot your sunscreen there. What? You've got tan-lines. I do? Well, I've never had them before... - (laughing) - You do too, Red. - What? - I'm going a bit gray myself. - Oh, no! - What is it? These aren't tan lines. We're starting to fade. That can only mean one thing. What do you think it'll be like when we have color, boss? I think I'd like to have polka dots. Or maybe I could be plaid! I bet Lois would go out with me if I was plaid. Girls love straight lines criss-crossing, criss-crossing. - Make you look handsome. - Hmm. - Nat: What? - (growling) Oh! Great work, your Royal Brawniness. Keep this up and we'll be done in no time! Hmm... Hey, you're not gonna let some spooky unnatural fog scare you? Anything could be in that fog. Any kind of creepy, crawly, ookie, slimy monster. - Huh? - I'll take the lead. Let's go everybody. (Yellow gasping) Green: What is this place? Everything's so glum. Yeah, makes Black look downright cheery. Ha. You're always so brave, Blue. How do you do it? What's your secret? No secret. But you're never afraid. Huh. That's what you think. I've got the heebie-jeebies right now. You do? But you don't show it. Oh. Well, maybe that's the secret. (spooky voices moaning) - (both gasping) - White: Creepy crawlies! Yellow was right. - (voices continue) - Voice 1: Go back! Go away! Voice 2: You are not welcome here. Voice 3:Come any closer and we'll leave you on the dashboard of a hot car! I always knew I'd end up melted by spooky disembodied voices. Ha! I'm not afraid of any fog creature... (whispering) much. Come on out! I dare you! Blue: I double dog dare you! (roaring) (all shouting) Voice 1: And don't come back. Moo. Moo? Hmm... Something smells fishy. Blue must have forgotten to change his socks again. I mean something's not right. Someone's gotta sneak back. What? Behind enemy lines? Ha. I'll do it! No. White has to go. - Alone. - Me?! (stammering) Why me? - Look at you. - White: Huh? You're naturally camouflaged. You'll blend right in. I know this is hard to do. Believe me, I know. But we need you. You need... me? Wow, you guys need me. This is my moment to shine. I'll do it! (quiet fart) Hmm. Huh? Huh? (gasps) - Was I okay? - You were great. What about me? Did I overplay it? No, no. I really liked the "or else" part. It implied consequences. Perilous consequences. - Moo. - Yeah, Cow. I really felt the complexity of your backstory and the emotional shading of your delivery. Why, you're not monsters! (all gasping) What? Um... - Grrr. - Boo? Moo! Fellas, it was a trick. No, no, no. We really are monsters! Yeah, I... I'm a dragon. Fierce, v... vicious. Very scary. (grunting) - Ouch! Not so hard! - (Blue chuckling) (quacking) So this was the menace? You bovine buffoon! You lactose lunatic! - You... - Moo. White! You were wonderful. As Brown would say... "Aww, shucks, ma'am. T'wern't nuthin'." Okay, you know, 'fess up. Who are you guys? We're, we're... We're unfinished drawings. The unfinished. The not-quite-good-enough. The ones that never made it on Ben's wall or Mom's fridge. Most of us don't even have names. - I'm Duck. This is Cow. - Moo. Everyone calls me Bumble Bee. - Astronaut. - Horse. - He's Race Car. - (squeaking) Pathetic, right? My name's Ricky... But... but, I'm.. I'm not exactly sure why. You live here? (beeping) What he means is nobody wants to hang out with us. Cow: Moo, moo. Besides, we have to hide here. If we don't, "it" might find us. (all gasping) "It?" What's... it? (quietly) The Great Waste. A terrible creature that eats unfinished drawings. Eats... drawings? (gulping) Yup. Stinger, wings, cute little chef's hat... He'd make a bee-lightful tuna sandwich out of me! - Get a grip, bumble-boy. - (bee laughing nervously) Come on, gang, we've got our own monster to fight. Maybe we'll catch you on the way back. Uh... how do we get outta here? - (bird calling) - Hmm. We're west of Eraser Mesa. No, no, no, avoid that place. You'll get rubbed out. We could head towards Glueisiana. You don't wanna get stuck there. How about cutting through Pencilvania? Oh, what's the point? (sighing) Well, what do you suggest? The quickest way is across the Wasteland. - We can take you. - Yellow: But it's a desert! We'll never make it. It's too hot. - We'll melt! - Hot? You betcha. But it's also our home. We can get you across. But, we'll have to go fast! Fast? - (galloping) - (all shouting) Hey, this is kinda fun! In fact... I love this! Yahoo! (all whooping) (all laughing) We're here. - Red: Here? - This is Rubber Band Ridge. From here, it's just a quick shot to the top of the mountain. (buzzing) We'll show you how. I do wish there was something we could do for you guys. Huh? Maybe we can. What do you mean? We could color our friends. Coloring? Now? Plus we're already fading. If you ask me, we don't have any color to spare. And don't forget about the big scary monster and his, um... flying thing. I know we still have a long way to go, but it's the right thing to do. The drawings helped us. It's our turn to help them. - Well... - I'm a crayon. Coloring is what I do. This is my destiny. And that cow needs some white! - Moo, moo? - And some black, too. (buzzing) See? It hardly takes a second. There. Now you're a palomino. (neighing) How about adding a little oomph to that fire! Ahh! What's a Mallard without green feathers? And a race car without a slick paint job - is just a rust bucket. - (beeping) Yellow: ♪ Whenever I'm looking for something to do ♪ ♪ A story brings me in ♪ ♪ Away from the things that make me afraid ♪ ♪ And then I can begin ♪ All:♪ You see, it's me My magic's coming through ♪ ♪ Color the world ♪ ♪ The greatest thing to do ♪ (quacking) ♪ Drawing our stories we like to explore ♪ ♪ With color and with style ♪ ♪ Led by our feelings and through every door ♪ ♪ We're finding our own smiles ♪ ♪ Let's sing and dance ♪ ♪ Our magic never ends ♪ ♪ Color the world ♪ ♪ It's better with our friends ♪ ♪ It's better with our friends ♪ ♪Better with our, better with our... ♪ (laughing) ♪ Friends ♪ Houston, we don't have a problem! (mooing happily) I am bee-utiful! (roaring) Hot stuff comin' through! Oh, I wish we had the words to thank you. (mooing) Bee-cisely, we're all utterly grateful. (Horse giggling) Moo. (sniffing) She does have a way with words. Are you guys gonna be all right? I think so, Ducky-Duck. We would have liked to give you even brighter colors, but we are getting paler by the minute. And we've only minutes to spare. (grunting) Well, then, let's get moving. Are you guys sure about this? Unless you know how to fly, this is the fastest way to the top. I always knew we'd end up being launched into oblivion. Hmm? Five... - four, three... - all gasping) - two, one. - Ha! - Blast off! - (Bee shouting) (all shouting) Wee! (all groaning) Help me. Someone. Hurry! I'm stuck in a rock. (creaking) (popping) (sighing) (sighing) (humming) Zaaam. Zam good or Zam bad? Zaaam! He and that flying thing are hoarding all the color for themselves! - (Nat humming) - (rocks clattering) What is that guy, anyway? - Some sort of a bat? - I dunno. There are creeps and there are jerks, but this guy, he's a real creep-jerk! - How do we stop him? - He is stronger than us. He is meaner than us! He is badder than us. We gotta have a plan. Plan? Good idea. - What's the plan? - Don't know. Planning is not my thing, dig? Maybe we can distract him long enough to destroy the dam? And how do we do that? Well... one of us will have to act as bait. And I know just who that should be. - Yellow. - Exactly. What? Wait, me? Blue... are you sure? Absolutely. We gotta think outside the crayon-box on this one! He chased her around Color City. I bet he'll follow her again. Besides, I believe in you, Yellow. Maybe it's time you believed in yourself. I... I believe in me, too. I can do it! I can do it! I can't do it! (sobbing) What was I thinking, coming here on my own? I'll never change. I'm yellow. Yellow, yellow to the core. I'll just sit here. That's it. I'll sit here on this rock for a while, then go back and tell them I couldn't find Scrawl. I'll just say I got lost in this snow. Snow? This isn't snow. It's... - (crunching) - P... P... paper! Eeek! The Great Waste! (burping) - Help, help, help! - (roaring) - Help, help, help! - (rumbling) (sighing) (gasping) (roaring) (gasps) That's it, your Royal Chop-Sockiness! Wax on, wax off! (grunting) (whimpering) Yeah, you better run, you Trashosaurus Rex! Yellow: You saved me. Why? (grunting) We tried to tell you. All we ever wanted was some color. Without it, we're just... Unfinished drawings. (sighing) You helped me. Now it's my turn to help you. (grunting softly) There. Now you truly are King Scrawl. Ah. Thank you. You're welcome, but we're almost out of color. We have to get the colorfall flowing again. This is my fault. I was being greedy. I never meant to cause you any harm. The dam must come down right away. But your Royal Clogginess, the dam is too strong for us to knock down by ourselves. My friends will help. Oh, I'm not so sure about that. I think the other crayons are afraid of me. I'll explain. It was all a big misunderstanding. You'll see. (both grunting) I knew this Rubber Bandolero would come in handy. We'll stretch it across the canyon, and when Scrawl gets near... Whammo! We get him. Signal! Signal! Bird sounds! That's the signal. Here they come! Places everyone. It's showtime! Yellow: Hello? Guys? Everything's okay. Olly olly auburn-free! They must be around here somewhere. Now! (all exclaiming) It's a trap! I knew it, your Sitting Duckliness. No, wait! We should never have followed her into Color City. An ambush. And I trusted you. (struggling) Get me down from here. (gnawing) I don't think I can, your Upside Downliness. I can only make paper cuts and this thing is rubber. Please, listen to me! You know him? Um... You led him to Color City? Well, not exactly... And how come he can speak? Did you draw him a mouth? - Yes, but he... - Whose side are you on, Yellow? Wait, listen.. Just stay out of our way, Yellow. - Haven't you done enough? - Please, please. You don't understand. You're right. We don't. Pardon my language, but you, sir, are a Grade-A poopy pants. (Nat gasping) Poopy pants? Well, that's awfully harsh, don't you think? Black: So what'll we do with them now? Blue: Gee, I dunno. Planning's not my thing. I think I mentioned that. Anyone got an idea? Let's make him into a great big paper pinata, and whammo! Yes! That sounds both appropriate and timely. Well, then... Charge! (both shrieking) This doesn't look good, your Punching Bagliness. Yellow: Stop! (all questioning) (gasps) Leave him alone! Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Siding with the monster again?! Stop calling him that! He's not a monster! - He's a king. - (thudding) - (all gasping) - (groaning) - Very nice landing. - (all questioning) And he saved my life. - What? - He did? He's good and kind and all he wants is some color. We never gave him a chance to explain. We judged him because we were afraid. I was afraid, too. But not anymore. Oh. Zam. Huh, uh, gee... Uh, we, um... Well, I... I suppose, in light of this new information... We've all acted like jerks. Yeah. Creep-jerks. And I am the worst offender of all. Will you forgive me? - (Nat sobbing) - Hmm? (blowing) I'm sorry. A happy ending gets me every time. It's not over yet. We've still got important work to do. And very little time. (all screaming) Colors are runnin' faster than a red sock in a washin' machine. - (siren wailing) - It is the end. Le coup de grace! Soon we will be saying au revoir, mon ami. (grimacing) My fade-o-meter tells me that we are now only 15.6 percent of our original color and dimming with alacrity! - (sobbing) - There, there. It ain't over till the fat crayon sings. (all gasping) Spoke too soon. (singing) Scrawl: Heave! All: Ho! - Heave! - Ho!! Heave! Ho! - It won't budge! - We need more help! There's no one else. It's up to us. Not quite, your Royal Mistakenliness. I have brought reinforcements. Ha-ha! - (thumping) - What was that? Sounds like the cavalry! (roaring) I've always had a way with giant terrestrial vertebrates. (chuckling) (straining) - Hey, this way. - Huh? - Yeah. - Okay, big fella. Get ready to pull. All right, everybody. On three. One! Two! Three! (grunting) All: Heave! (all exclaiming) (all cheering) - Ah. - (both chuckling) Yeah! Hue, shade, tint, saturation are all returning! It seems appropriate to interject at this juncture a hearty hoo-ha! (laughing) Those rapscallions did it! Yee-haw! C'est manifique! Aww, shucks, ma'am. (chuckling) Spontaneous osculation, reaction of embarrassment combined with a measure of bashful delight. Oh, very good. Very good, indeed. (all saying goodbye) Blue: Stay cool! If you can get us back to Color City right away, I think there's enough time. Very possibly. (crowd cheering) (Scrawl chuckling) Looking good, your Royal Highness. (chuckling) As do you, my trusty, uh... Uh, what are you, anyway? Bug, bird, bat. It doesn't matter when you look this good! And you have great friends. You know, I debated about pinstripes, but it's not really the season. Maybe this winter. - I don't know. Tweed's the... - (clearing throat) Folks, we owe our heroes a great big ball of thanks. And none more so than Yellow. So, little miss, the highest award we can bestow: The Color Wheel of Honor. Professor, the medal, please? - (beeping) - (chuckling) Oh, no, no, that's not it. Oh, how did that get in there? This? No. Oh, my, this isn't mine. Oh, is that a gelatin marsupial? I wonder if it's still good. Nope, not good! No, it's awf... Oh, wait. Oh, bingo! Here it is! I knew it was here all along, it was just at the bottom... (gasping) You truly are the Hero of Color City. (all cheering) - (alarm ringing) - (clock tolling) Sorry, folks, this square dance is over. - Ben is waking up in five... - Hurry, folks! - four... - After you. three... two... (music playing on radio) (music stops) Hmm? (gasping) Whoa! When did I... Cool! Bumblebee: I am bee-utiful! (engine beeping) Houston, we don't have a problem. Hot stuff comin' through! Oh, I wish we had the words to thank you. - (mooing) - (Nat muttering) Ooh, hey, Ricky. I wonder if there's a way to share crayons with children who might not have - any of their own. - Oh.
