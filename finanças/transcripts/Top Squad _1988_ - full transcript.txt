Yes Please move the bike away I'll come back in a minute OK Hi, Madam Wu I'd like to ask you a common question What's it? Have you any plans for marriage? I won't think of it for the time being A woman needs... a man's protection A member of the Female Commando is an exception Impossible, but few men are eligible He should at least be a Tiger Squad member It doesn't make any sense There's attraction... between the 2 sexes A man's more powerful than a woman and he should protect her all the life This is the law of nature Our members will wrestle... with your squad tomorrow Wrestling? How? We'll select persons for each other Best 2 out of 3 Okay Go out Ten bottles of face cream Are you provoking me to fight him?

Let's fight one game to decide Don't take it so seriously! Why did you pull the punches? How could I hit the one I love? I wouldn't hit the one I love either Really? Thank you Let's go Mr. Kan, don't be sorry There's no shame in losing to a girl You think I couldn't beat Madam Wu? I pulled the punches only What's so funny? Your flop in the 1st match... is fatal for the whole match Don't shirk the responsibility I don't mind bearing the blame What did you say? I don't mind accepting the responsibility And you, too, Man To woo Jean, you pulled your punches... Mr. Kan, I didn't... You're not to blame But don't repeat it next time Yes, Sir You're OK, you beat Ailene in a few blows Thank you, Mr. Kan Nonsense Is it a glory for a man... to wound a woman? We pulled our punches because we were sympathetic to the weaker sex Don't you know they're also born of mothers? Yes So much the better Do 3,000 push-ups... for a minor punishment Mr. Kan, I was also born of a mother This is to punish a mother's son Attention This is Madam Law, Captain of lnterpol Action Squad She'll be our guest coach... for 1 month Today's my first meeting with you all I know nothing about... your 3-month training I want to hear about your skills Amy, you first Thank God Thank God, there's something to show And it can be regarded up to the standard Not bad Better than the average What do you mean?

Lift your guns and come out Look at me One shot kills four... It's now your turn One shot kills four...

Ailene Ailene's missing Lend a hand Let's scatter and find her Ailene Let's scatter and find her Be alert A trick again This time I won't be taken in Right I am Help! Joanne Well, any trace? Over there You chicken, I'll make you minced meat With your skills? Madam? Me Madam, why make fun of us? It's not for fun If you can't even kidnap me you're not good enough And you're a disgrace to the Commando I want you all to be punished I'll kill you Is this performance worthy of the Commando? Today's training is jogging You've already practised that What's wrong? This kind of jogging? I've read your file I thought it was the record for babies only You're not eligible to be a member Just speak what you have in mind Madam, the Female Commando is human We can't do anything... beyond our power You have not done your best I've already done everything possible No point in arguing now I can prove you haven't done your best I'm sure after this training you'll make much faster progress Amy, Jean, Ailene, follow me Yes, Madam Go to the opposite when I shout "Go" Yes, Madam Gasoline? Go Help, help! I don't want to get burnt. Help! Help! It's hot, it's hot You're scaring me to death How do you feel?

Maybe So you're here. Please come in This is lnterpol Superintendent, Madam Law's superior This is Mr. Kan, and Madam Wu Glad to meet you Nice to meet you Please don't be formal Thank you Mr. Heman got a tip-off... from the lnterpol that a jewelry gang is arriving at HK What for? Couldn't be for a sight-seeing! They mean to attend the lnternational Jewelry Exhibition in Jinza Villa tomorrow night The total value of the jewelry exceeds $80 million 1 5 sets exceed $40 million The Star of Solomon... is valued at $30 million Our mission is... to help protect the gems A pity we can't get concrete data of them and capture the thugs... at one fell swoop Who are they? What's their number? We still don't know how they're going to act It's a thorny case I think it suits the Tiger Squad I've decided... to put both "Tiger" and Female Commando in charge of security It may be a gem-studded affair and it may turn into a battlefield We may protect the jewelry, but not those female members Otherwise, the robbers may get away I think each girl member can take care of herself I think those girl can help us If the Tiger Squad is to undertake the mission alone their awe-inspiring presence may arouse conspicuous attention With some girls' presence, they won't be so conspicuous OK, for decoration alone, I don't mind Well, it's fixed then Listen to Madam Law's... views on deployment Dismissed Any questions? No So they look feminine with their makeup The Female Commando must obey... to complete the mission What has this to do with makeup? Our duty today is to act as your flower vases So we've satisfied your demands now I'd rather not hinder your talks on deployment OK Madam Wu, can't you understand my feeling now? I can't understand what you mean In fact, I objected to the girls taking part in the operation only because it could be a battlefield I don't want you... to be in trouble Everyone's concentrating on protecting the gems Don't be so mushy Madam, I'm standing by your side also to protect something important What is it? Such a short skirt could be tempting I bet $10 with you on the color inside How could you peep at that? Would I ever do such a dirty thing? I suspect an offensive weapon inside it You must do that then It hurts me to have such a pupil I couldn't help it Mr. Kan Mr. Kan? Don't you know your behaviour It has already ruined my years' reputation once and for all? I don't understand the thoughts of the youth What's wrong with the color of her underpants? Why was it necessary to look at it? Mr. Kan, I've checked it Her underpants are red with white rims Great. How do you know it? You're dirty Mr. Kan told me to do it Shut up Madam Bastard Madam, we borrowed the shoes from the Govt Ordinance to check offensive weapons I've checked everything. It's alright Okay, let's proceed as planned There's police Shall we inform our men to quit? So much the better By finishing them off, we've nearly made it Which people outside are police? We, the Tiger squad, never yield I didn't know you were one of the squad Who else is the Tiger squad? I won't tell you Are you going to tell? No No? No So he's your most respected Training Officer What a tell-tale story Inform Black Spider to take action You know... I never said sweet words to girls In fact, many girls told me they like me but I love no one but you Are you serious? Yes Madam, I've long wanted to say this but had no nerve to say it Now I must say it anyway Sorry, it must be sweet then Tell me later, as nature calls now OK Madam, in fact, I've been hiding this...
