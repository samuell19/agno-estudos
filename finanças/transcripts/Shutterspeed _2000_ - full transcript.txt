[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] He's got to be close. Find, Mr. Knox and don't come back without that camera. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Mark, go, go! [GUNSHOTS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Sorry to interrupt your dinner. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GASP] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Small world, isn't it, Rachel? [GASP] I told you what would happen if you came back. I'll leave, I swear, I promise, I'll never comeback, Riley. That's what you said the last time. [GASP] Ooh, you've been busy. [GASP] Let's find out if it's a boy or girl? [SCREAMS] Help, somebody help. Baby's got a nasty habit. Riley, please let me go. It's okay, I'm a cop. It's all secure. All right, folks, let's head out of the washroom, please.

Oh, I can't. Griffin just called. Have do that quickie for Vogue and I'm late already. Stand me up for a few bucks? Somebody's gotta pay the rent. Tell you what though, make you dinner. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] POLICE OFFICER: Okay Ma'am, just calm down, we'll send someone over. POLICE OFFICER: Hello... Ah, Detective Davis. Man of the hour. What is your problem? -What? -Well, does hotel ring a bell? Don't you think it's a little unusual that somebody could get that pregnant in three weeks, especially a man? Well, I knew he was carrying. All I did was cut opening the package. Yes, but you did it in front of everyone at the hotel. -I did do that. -Yes. Get back to work. In my office. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] DERMITT: Davis? Friend of yours came by while you're out, he said his name was Mark. Wanted me to give you this. He said you should call him. Is that peanut butter and cream cheese on a donut? Yeah. It's disgusting. Delicious, man. [CHUCKLES] Nice to see you carry a loaded weapon, Dermitt. [DIALING TELEPHONE] Hey, Mark. This is Riley. What's up with this camera? Give me a call. And what you're doing back already? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] Hey, Riley. Hello, Heather. How was Sam today? Oh, he is so cute. We went a really long walk. Think I really tired him out. Good. Oh, any luck finding my jeep yet? Yes. HEATHER: Oh, really? It wasn't stolen, it was impounded. No way. Yes way. Seems you don't pay your parking tickets. Oh, so they just stole my car? You pick it up at the lot next to the station and no more tickets, okay? HEATHER: Okay. You are so cool. And you are so cute. [SIGHS] Oh, I told Kenzie to say thank you for setting me up with Perry last night. He's a real hottie. Glad it worked. HEATHER: Yeah, he just better not show you the pictures we took. [CHUCKLES] Hey, Sam. Good boy. Hey, Sam. How you doing? Good boy. Good boy. Hey, you. Hey, sexy. Hmm. Hmm. -That feels good. -Hmm, you feel good. Could you... Grab me... a tomato? Hmm, not exactly what I was thinking of. Hey, your brother Mark's back in town. Heather said he came by today. I thought he was in Berlin doing a Marlboro shoot. Marlboros are really good, good for him. RILEY: He dropped this off. Hey, maybe it's our wedding present. Look at this. Only one picture's been taken. [GIGGLES] I can't wait to see this one. Uh-uh. This one is for me not you. Looks good. Hey, Sam. Here boy. [GRUNTS] What did you do with it? You think I'm stupid? [GULPS] I tell you that I'm dead. If you don't, you're dead. What did you take do with it? [GRUNTS] It's going to be a long night. [SIGHS] [PHONE BEEPS] KENZIE: Hey, bro, it's Kenzie. How you doin'? I heard you're back early? Listen, give me a call about mom's birthday party, okay? You know, she would really love it if you could make it. -Oh, and by the way... -Mama's boy, huh? Go to hell. KENZIE: ..great and says that [INDISTINCT] [GRUNTS] KENZIE: ...who knew, huh? So, anyway, give me a call and we'll deal [INDISTINCT] -Okay? Bye. -You tell me. -[PHONE BEEPS] -RILEY: Hey, Mark. This is Riley, what's up with this camera? Give me a call. What are you doing back already? [PHONE BEEPING] It's a shame you're ending your career this way. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [PANTING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMS] Dad! [PANTING] [CLEARS THROAT] -Hi, Heather. -Hi, Riley. Am I interrupting? No. I was just, uh-- So, I guess Kenzie has a show tonight? -Yup. -I'm gonna go give Sam a walk. See ya. [LAUGHS] Call me. Perry. Thanks a lot. Hey, I need a favor. No, your favors just get me in trouble. Ah, ooh. But then again, you and Kenzie did hook me up with Heather. What's up? Oh, this thing was stuck, jammed or something, the film, I can't get it out. Nice. I have one of these. Now, the catch release is bent. Did Heather say anything about me? Oh, yeah. I mean, we really hit it off. And in more ways than one, apparently. Yeah, she's pretty cool. Great. Can you develop that film? That is what I do. What did she say? She said to, uh, make sure that you show me the pictures you took of her. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] So why did you call me in here? Cliff passes D1. Good for him. Highest score ever. I've accepted his request for transfer. You're joking. Don't do this to me. What? You're in narcotics, he's in homicide. You don't have to cross paths if you don't want to. I know what you're trying to do, but it's not gonna change the way I feel. [SIGHS] Come on, he's your brother. Give him a break. Well, I'm proud of him, your dad would've been, too. Yeah. We finished? Yeah. [GUNSHOTS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL RINGS] [SIGHS] What a surprise. I tried to call you and talk about this transfer, but you never seem to get the messages. Oh, I got them. East Coast, uh, too cold for you? Feels colder in here. Riley, please can we get together and have a beer after work and talk about this? Sure. Why not, um, Madden's Bar? It was dad's favorite. Remember? [CRICKETS CHIRPING] So, Walt just bring it on me. Your brother is reaching out to you. He's wasting his time. With your father being gone, -it's never gonna change. -Uh-hmm. Cliff's the only family you have left. Not all of us come from perfect families, Kenz. Uh-hmm. My family is not perfect. What are you gonna do when we have problems, huh? You're gonna walk away from me? It's not fair. You don't even know him. Look, your brother is good guy. He said that when you guys were little, your dad... -You talked to him? -Well, you won't. Now, that's perfect. Come on, Riley. Open up, give him a chance. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [PIANO MUSIC PLAYS] [SIGHS] [PIANO MUSIC PLAYS] Did I wake you up? Um, no. The piano did. [CHUCKLES] -Detective Davis? -Yes. Welcome aboard. I'm Melissa Flynn. Do you have a first name, officer Flynn? -Uh, Melissa. -I'm Cliff. Sergeant Roberts asked me to give this to you, -it's, um, your first case. -Thank you. Uh, he also wants you to stop by his office before you head out. Um, I don't know if you have anybody, um, showing you the ropes around here, but, you know, if you need someone. I would appreciate that, thank you. [PHONE RINGS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Cliff. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Um... it's nice to finally meet you, Kenz. Yeah, you too. Hey, have a seat. This is kind of weird for me because, uh, I know that you and I have talked, but, uh... I've just seen you in so many billboards and so many magazines and it just-- it's weird, I just-- I feel like I know you. Yeah, I get that a lot. So how long have you been modeling? Since I was six. My mom sent in a picture of my brother and me to this cereal box contest and we ended up on the cover. Um, Rainbow Flips. Oh, get out of here. -That was my favorite cereal. -Me, too. I was the one with no teeth. That's funny. Kenzie, listen, I want you to know... how much I appreciate what you're doing here. Riley. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Riley! Wait, Riley! Riley, please! You can't keep running away from him. -It's your brother in there. -That's right my brother, not yours. Stay out of it. [SIGHS] Something wrong? What's Kenzie's brother's name? Mark. Why? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CAMERA WHIRRING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] CLIFF: Riley... what are you doing here? He was, uh... a good friend. Perry, I need that film I gave you developed ASAP. I'm on it. KENZIE: Hi, this is Kenzie. Leave me a message. Kenzie, it's me. We need to talk. I'm sorry about your friend. His, uh, housekeeper found him, said he wasn't supposed to be back until the 23rd. He was in Berlin. Do you have any idea why he might've come back-- No. So this guy, uh, worked with Kenzie, or-- Check the last names, detective. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, it's her brother. I'm sorry, Riley. [SIGHS] He was gonna be my best man. I know this is hitting really close to home, but I'm no overwriting Roberts, he's head of homicide. There's something going on here and I don't want the just lack of experience missing it. I know how hard this must be for you, but Cliff stays on the case. I know Mark's friends and his circles. -Your narcotics. -That's a label and you know it. All right. Then put me on the case with him. Look, earlier, you said, you didn't wanna be in the same station with him. Things have changed. No. You're not ready to work. I can't sit still on this one, Walt. It's Kenzie's brother. All right. All right. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll, uh, talk to Roberts, get him to sign off, but it all boils down to Cliff. If he says yes, okay. But he remains officer- in-charge. That's the best I can do. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR BELL RINGING] GRIFFEN: And that would affect things, huh? [CHUCKLES] Oh, you've got to be joking. Uh, it is what it is. Well, yeah-- sure, but, uh, I mean, it still doesn't affect her fee. Yeah. Well, you wouldn't be calling me if you didn't already know that, right? [LAUGHS] GRIFFEN: Yeah, okay. You too, bye. -Griffen. -[SIGHS] You're, uh... office said you'd be here. Yeah. So much for my day off. Don't tell me you're gonna trade in your badge for a talent agent, right? Not today. You sound serious, what's up? Mark. He was found dead... this morning in his apartment. He was murdered. No, that's--uh, that's not possible. Mark is in Berlin. That's what I thought. When was the last time you talked to him? Um... couple of days ago. What the hell happened? Don't know. Not yet. He mention anything to you about a camera? Um, no. Why? He tried to get a hold of me yesterday, and he dropped one at the station. Anyone else working with him on that shoot over there? Uh, Eric Knox. - RILEY: You know him? -Yeah, he's a client of mine. RILEY: You talked recently? Well same as Mark, a few days ago. - Were they friends? -GRIFFEN: Yeah, sure. They worked--uh... they worked a few jobs together. Look, I'm sorry, I--uh... I just can't believe this is happening. You know what? Mark just split... you'd think this Knox would try to get a hold of you... if he thought anything was up? Well sure, he would if he was there, but he could be in another country. I mean, the kid's been on fire since Calvin put him on the Time Square billboard. So, uh... we arranged some other bookings for him while I was over there. Well, I'll need a contact sheet and a number where I can reach him. Yeah, no problem. I'll--uh... I'll have something faxed over. Uh, Riley. Um, how's Kenzie taking it? She doesn't know yet. I'm gonna wait till she gets home. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] His name is Eric Knox. You hook up with him. Tell him I need to talk to him -right away. -MAN: Sure. Anything on Mark? Oh, they're faxing me a contact sheet of who he worked with over there in, uh, Berlin. MAN: Good, anything else? Nope. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey. Bradford or Roberts get a hold of you? Yeah. Bradford talked to me. And? Are you sure you're comfortable with us working together? If you're asking me to forget what happened between us, I can't. That doesn't answer my question, Riley. I need to find out what happened. -You know, dad didn't even-- -[METAL SLAMS] Don't even start. Right now, I've got a friend in the morgue. That means working with you to find out what happened, I'll do it. But it changes nothing between us. The question is, Detective, are you professional enough to handle that? Yeah. Then I guess we can work together. PERRY: Hey. Here it is. I don't think it was intentional. Shutter aperture were way off, so is the focus. -Any ideas? -Nada. Sent the neg to the FBI for you, though. It's a long shot but they're gonna run it through the TS1, see if they can pick up any images. TS1? Oh, it's a state of the art computer. CLIFF: Yeah, you, uh, feed in the neg and it gives you a variance of pics depending on what aperture and shutter speed you program into, right? As if you had accidentally shouted out those marks. It's not exact, but it can get pretty close. -Thanks. -CLIFF: Well, the front door chain had been latched, it was kicked in from the outside, and the perps probably knew Pearson was home, they were looking for something specific. More than one? The maid vacuumed while he was away. We found four different sets of shoe imprints in the throw rug, including Mark's. Now, according to his ticket, he arrived yesterday morning, that's a week earlier than his itinerary indicated. And I also got the prelim back from the ME's office, estimated time of death is somewhere between 7:00 and 10: 00 last night. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE REVVING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] RILEY: Heather. [PHONE RINGING] -Kenzie. -Riley, listen. What I did back at the restaurant-- Kenzie, where are you? At the show, but wait, let me finish. -No. -KENZIE: Riley, this important. Kenzie, will you shut up and listen to me? Don't ever talk to me like that again. Kenzie. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Walt, I'm telling you, someone's looking for this camera, and now they might be going for Kenzie. [PHONE BEEPS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Come with me. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] TESS: Kenz, where are you going? [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] -What's going on? -She's fine. Kenz, who is this guy. [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SIRENS BLARING] WOMAN: She's not here. And we have another homicide on our hands. Single gunshot. One of the models. Her name is Tess Lapowsky. We have teams on the way. [SIRENS BLARING] Somebody had to seen something. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome. Somebody has been calling her. It wouldn't be her detective boyfriend, would it? The one with our camera. My brother gave him that camera. What does he have to do with this? Nothing. Anymore. You have my sympathies. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] No! MAN: Hey, Perry. You guys, wanna get her out of here now. KENZIE: Hi. This is Kenzie. Leave me a message. [SIGHS] Please, God. -Riley. -Please, God. We'll find her. I thought I just called Mark yesterday. Oh, you can't play like that. -Tess and Heather-- -Okay. Assuming that Kenzie has been kidnapped. These guys are gonna wanna trade for that camera. So, we're gonna put taps on all your phones forward the calls to the station. There's no reason for you to stay here. -No taps. -Oh, come on. -Don't be stupid. -Oh, these guys want that camera, Walt. I'm gonna give it to them. I don't care what this is about. -I just want Kenzie back. -[SIGHS] I don't want anyone messing this up. They've already killed two of your friends. They're playing for keeps. Now, you better slow down and start thinking straight cowboy or so help me, I'm gonna put your ass in a cell. M.E. guys want you to sign out for the victim? [SIGHS] So, who was she? She was in modeling friend of Kenzie. She'd walk the dog for us. -[SIRENS BLARING] -[CAMERA CLICKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I got Glocks, I got AK-47's, Berettas, you name it, I got it. Have a seat. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] CLIFF: So, let's have a look. It ain't for free, pal. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] You show me the cash and I'll flash you the stash, baby. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I called him. [SIGHS] -Any word on Kenzie? -No, not yet. Anything weird? So far, nobody seems to be able to locate this Knox kid anywhere. He didn't show for a photo shoot yesterday or today. But I did find out the kid's got three crimes, all gambling, one conviction, didn't do any time. -DERMITT: Lieutenants. -Yup. They're still interviewing everyone at the warehouse but so far, no one saw a thing. [SIGHS] All right. Carry on. DERMITT: Cliff, Berlin police, line three. This just came in from Mark Pearson's agent. I asked for a list of people Mark was working -for in Berlin. -All right. Good. Good. That tracer set up? Yeah. Harrington's got it ready. Where's that camera? Found Eric Knox. Where is he? Turned up dead in Berlin, a bunch of bullets in him. [SIGHS] -[PHONE RINGS] -All right, everybody. Hold it down. Start the trace. [PHONE RINGS] -You ready? -Yeah. [PHONE RINGS] Okay. Answer it. Hello. MAN: Play this like it's not the call you've been waiting for and you might see her again. Look. This really isn't a good time to talk -about flower arrangements. -KENZIE: Riley? Dermitt, kill the trace. KENZIE: They want you to bring the camera to the parking structure in South Berg Drive in 30 minutes, bottom level. If you don't come alone... -MAN: We will kill her. -I'll run it by Kenzie and see what she thinks. WALTER: Dermitt. -DERMITT: Yes. -Take this camera down to the lab. Have them check it out, -see what they can find. -All right. I need some coffee. I'll drop it off on my way. Thank you. What's going on? Just stay out of it. CLIFF: That was him on the phone, wasn't it? Riley, you give them that camera and it's over. You got a whole police force here, now use it. I don't have another choice. Now, get out of my way. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Where's Kenzie? She'll be released in an hour. What guarantee do I have? My word. Comforting. You'll see her in an hour. I better. [SIREN BLARING] No! Freeze! [TIRES SCREECHING] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] Hold it! Get back to the elevator! Back off! Now you drop your gun or I'll cut her, -I swear to God, I will do it. -Don't please. -Please. -Do what he says. Let her go. No, you listen to me, you put the gun down now or she'll get it. WOMAN: Drop your gun please. Drop it. I'm warning you, drop it or she dies. RILEY: I've got a gun, you've got a knife, do the math. You're not getting out of here. You listen to her mom. Or she gets it. You heard her, you're still not getting out of here. You don't believe me? RILEY: All right. All right. Gun's going down. Good. Let her go! [GUNSHOTS] [GRUNTS] [CLATTER] Where is she?! Where is she?! You can go to hell. Tell me! CLIFF: Riley, get off of him! -Stop it! -Just leave it alone, could you? I didn't want you going alone without backup?! What are you trying to do? Get everyone I care about killed? I promise you, if Kenzie, dies... [PANTS] I wasn't gonna let him hurt her. You had no right. I had no choice. You knew better. -I was handling it! -WALTER: Oh, how? I had a transmitter in the lens. I was gonna follow them myself and then assess the situation myself. And then call. Cliff, I wanna make sure this gets to the lab this time. Shut the door would you? Now, give me your cell phone. Look, the next call that comes in is going at speaker phone, if there is one. Riley, I have cut you a lot slack but so help me man, I will take your gun and your badge if I have to. These guys are not afraid to waste anybody. There is more than Kenzie at stake here. They need to be stopped. And you working alone does not ensure that. Now, give me that damn phone! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] RILEY: Cliff, I need that camera. CLIFF: Bradford said that you can't have it-- RILEY: Give me that! [GRUNTS] -Feel better? -[PANTS] Are you done? I don't wanna do this, Cliff. I just need the camera. You don't think that I feel the pain of him being gone. He's my father too. I miss the way that it used to be with us, that's all that I've ever wanted. You became a cop for all the wrong reasons -and one of them got dad killed. -It wasn't my fault. Well I just might die because I'll shop early today. [CHUCKLES] You think I'm really stupid, don't you? Well... You are the stupid one. RILEY: You shouldn't have been there in first place. You were in over your head. -I wasn't. -Dad was worried about you. We both know what went down that night. Yeah. We do. And you thought coming here was gonna change things between us? It's not that easy Cliff. You need my help on this, you can't do it alone and you know it. Kenzie's all I have. And you're all that I have Riley. Please. Kenzie, can use both of us. [SIGHS] All right. Get your cell and meet me in the lab. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Mr. Diamond would like to see you. How did you get in? [SCOFFS] MAN: Back it up, back it up. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] CLIFF: Did you find anything? Not yet. CLIFF: Riley. Are you sure about this? If anyone's gonna make any decisions that can affect Kenzie's life, it's gonna be me. Yeah, I'm sure. [DIALING] [PHONE RINGS] Riley, isn't it? RILEY: Yeah. Who are you? You are the detective, you figure it out. Well, I just might. ANGELO: Are you sweating it yet? I could ask you the same thing. You don't follow directions very well do you? That wasn't my fault, it won't happen again. And I'm supposed to trust you? Look, I don't care who you are or what this is about, I guarantee, there won't be any more mistakes. Now, let's try this again. You'll get a call at 10:00 AM to tell you where. Last chance, then she is history. Now, let me talk to Kenzie. Certainly. 10:00 they're gonna call. Riley I, uh... worked back East for a couple of years in negotiations and, uh, and I got to tell you. These kind of guys have a no return policy. I mean, if they show up with it... there's no guarantee they're gonna hand her over. I know. That's why we have to figure out what the deal is with that camera. [SIGHS] The answer's in there somewhere I know it is. [SIGHS] Last thing I did was have a fight with her. About bringing us together? Look at us now. [SNORTS] Cliff, um, I got to tell you something. When you left that day with your mom, I found dad in your room crying. I had never seen dad cry before. [SIGHS] You know what I thought? I thought he loved you more than he loved me. And I thought the opposite because he never asked me to stay. She married money, you, you could've done anything with your life. [SIGHS] I thought that... being a cop was the only way to make dad as proud of me as he was of you. [SIGHS] He was always proud of you. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] That night dad was killed, he really was worried that you were... in over your head. He made a big mistake going into the bar that night, and I made a big mistake letting him go. Because he didn't go in as a cop, he went in as a father. That's what got him killed. And you've blamed me all these years. I couldn't blame myself. RILEY: Cliff, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. It's okay. [EXHALES] [SIGHS] [SNIFFS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Riley. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Look at this. [SEAGULL CAWING] ANGELO: I'm so pleased that you could join me. MAN: Yeah. I didn't have much choice did I? Now, what's this all about? ANGELO: You have to understand something. How our present situation needs to be handled with a certain precision. Yeah. Okay. So, what are you getting at? First the Knox kid, now this. MAN: Look, uh, I'm kind of busy today, okay. I don't have time for guessing games, so, could you just cut to the chase? You have no idea. This is perfect. I get a call from your friend Riley before you even know what's happening. Maybe I should I get him to work for me. You didn't get the camera? No, I didn't get the camera. Well, why? What happened? Your obligation in this contract was very simple. But because of your incompetence a lot of people including yourself stand to lose a tremendous amount of money. Five years, and six million. Real money not counterfeit to pay off our friends in customs, and just like that it could all fall apart. Well, now wait a minute, it is not my fault that Knox found out about our cut and wanted more. He was not committed you said he was. MAN: Look, things didn't go right okay? We can try again. I know Riley, he'll do anything for Kenzie. We'll get the camera back. ANGELO: I know because he's going to give it to you. [SNICKER] You will call him at 10: 00 AM and get him to come over to you a little loft. Tell me you've been contacted as an intermediary. [CHUCKLES] He's not stupid, he'll guess that I'm involved. ANGELO: Not for long, Dixon will make sure of that. You just need to get him to your place. Now look guys, I don't know about this. Let me take the guess work out of this for you. You don't have a choice, do you understand? You will do this because you're life now depends on it. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] [SEAGULL CAWING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I can barely make anything out. Well, it looks like, letters and numbers I think. [DOOR SQUEAK] What's going on? Uh, we needed some privacy, I hope you don't mind. Perry, are you all right? I take so many pictures. Never photograph someone I know. I liked her. I know. [SIGHS] Well, I got something that would do a better job. They use it to examine hair fragments, fibers, stuff like that. RILEY: Barcodes? And letters, followed by 12-digit numbered sequences. I have no idea. The letters are airport destinations. ORY is Orly Airport. Is Orly Airport in Paris, right? Uh, MAD is Madrid, TXL is Tegel in Berlin. How did you get so smart? I worked a sting in an airport for six months, saw enough baggage tags to give me nightmares. This is about baggage tags? Not these, tags have 10 digit sequences. CLIFF: So, what are they? My guess, customs clearance codes. Anyone scans them they read like they've already been cleared and inspected. Whatever they're running just passes right through. So, they're smuggling something. Look at the dates. That first one is a day after tomorrow. That's why they're getting desperate. Okay. So, what are they bringing through? [SIGHS] That's the million-dollar question. There has to be a genuine commitment to the M from all in this place. Are you committed Griffen? I need to know. It all depends on you. I told you I'm committed. We will see. Could you bring our dear Kenzie please? Why? The girl doesn't even know I'm involved. Now she will. Commitment, Griffen, I need you to show me. Griffen, you're part of this? [GUN COCKS] Shoot her. -What? -You heard me. Griff, Griff why? Look, I told you I'm committed, killing her is not gonna make any difference. It will to me. Now shoot her. [EXHALES] We were friends. You and Mark were not supposed to be involved. But we trusted you. You wanna see commitment? Yes. I'm sorry. [GUN CLICKS] [GASPS] That was very entertaining, thank you. But we can't quite get rid of her yet. Go. But at least, um, I know you are as greedy as the rest of us. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] CLIFF: So, what now? RILEY: Bradford's expecting a call from these guys we'll give him one. It'll buy us some time, then at 10:00 AM I'm gonna call those scum bags and tell them what we found in this camera. You know, that can make them very nervous. Nervous is good. [PERPLEXING MUSIC PLAYING] How's it going? [SIGHS] Okay. I guess. [CAR ENGINE GRUMBLING] [PHONE DIAL] Anything new in the camera? Uh, lab guys didn't come up with a thing. WOMAN: There's a call coming through on your cell, Harington's put it through on speaker. This is Riley. MAN: That wasn't very smart what you pulled down here. You were supposed to be alone. That wasn't my fault, it won't happen again. MAN: Anymore surprises and your girlfriend's dead. Let me talk to Kenzie. ANGELO: Shut up and listen to me. You will receive instructions in three hours and you will come alone this time. I promise. Now let me talk to Kenzie. [SIGHS] We get it? Sorry, Riley. It's... Damn it. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [PERPLEXING MUSIC PLAYING] I want tactical and all support units available and waiting. Yeah. Bye. [THUD] Okay. We got everybody on standby. Unless we get finger prints or something with Kenzie's car, we're just gonna sit still and wait until the next call comes in. Uh, Riley's going crazy, he wants to go back home for a while. I thought I'd take him. [SIGHS] All right. But have him back here by 11:00 AM. -Okay. -And Cliff, in case Riley hasn't told you, you're doing a great job. Well, I'm glad I could help him. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] CLIFF: How did you and Kenzie meet? It was at a police fund raiser. A bunch of cops were being auctioned off as dates. [SNICKERS] She bought me. We've been together ever since. [SIGHS] Anyone in your life? I was engaged once. But when I told her I wanted to work on the street, and it wasn't Wall Street, she kind of changed her mind. [CHUCKLES] Riley. What you were saying about... dad being a father, not a cop. Do you think that... maybe you're doing that with Kenzie now? It might be hard for you to believe, but... the night that the guy had that gun on dad, I knew what I was doing. Your stupid life! [GUNSHOTS] RILEY: Drop your weapon and release the hostage. Cliff, lower your gun, nice and slow. -CLIFF: No way. -I said lower your gun! JOSEPH: It's fine, son. RILEY: I said drop your weapon and put your hands above your head-- [GUNSHOT] Dad! I would have never lowered my gun. All you had to do was lower yours and... that guy, his gaze would have shifted. I would have had him. I couldn't tell you that. [SIGHS] It's just experience. I didn't want Dad to go that night. Why? Because I knew you could handle it yourself... for whatever it's worth. It's worth a lot. I don't expect you to be a part of this if they call. You just let me worry about that, okay? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Get them in front of the window. I'll take care of the rest. You got 40 minutes to make that phone call. I'll go and get set up across the way. Yeah. You do that. [GUN COCKS] [BIRD CHIRPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] PERRY: Knock, knock. Thought you might wanna see this before Bradford does. -FBI? -Yeah. I was right. The shot wasn't intentional, that the camera was dropped. And when they cleaned up the photo, it was of a storefront window, but they also found something else. A reflection with three people in it. Enlarging him was the easiest, he was closest to the reflection. It was your friend, Mark. Yeah. PERRY: Yeah. And judging by the look on his face and the way his body's blurred, he's probably running away. This guy was closer than the other. Do you know him? No. This guy was the furthest away. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Griffen. [DOOR SLAMS OPEN] Riley! What the hell is going on? Shut up! Where is she? -How would I know? -RILEY: Talk! Fast! Skip the part about you not knowing anything about this. Look, you don't understand, Riley. Try me. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] We're talking about a billion euro dollars here, all packed, ready to go, 350 million-- I don't care! Where is she? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] It's not my fault. Kenzie's like a daughter to me and I never meant for this to happen. What did that make Mark? That was Knox. -Knox-- -Stop stalling. NIGEL: Get out of the way, you idiot. [GUN COCKS] -Believe me, Riley, I never-- -Tell me! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Where's Kenzie? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, Griffen. Where is Kenzie? I never meant for things to happen this way. [HEAVING] If you care about her at all, tell me where she is. [GROANS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah. [PHONE CLICKS] Bradford's pissed, but he's on his way. Kenzie? CLIFF: She's still in the car, but, uh... it looks like they're getting ready to go. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] ANGELO: Well, well. This is an unexpected surprise. I like to work like that. So nice to see a man happy in his work. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] So, you have come to trade? Yeah. I figured neither one of us are in the mood to continue this "game". Maybe I should just shoot you and end it then. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] It wouldn't be a good idea. Then you wouldn't know what I did with the copy of the microfilm. Don't turn around, Kenzie. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Move to the driver seat. How do I know you didn't already share the information with anyone? You don't? I don't. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Now let me talk to Kenzie. In the truck. Go! [TRUCK ENGINE REVS] [GUNSHOTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SIREN WAILING] [GUNSHOTS] [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [GUNSHOTS] Let's get out of here! Why aren't we lifting off? Not with that up there! [TIRES SCREECHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] I never could get used to driving on the right. Drop your gun. CLIFF: Freeze. I suggest you put your gun down. You're a dead man, Diamond. No, I just look like one. I said drop your gun now. It's over! It will be for Riley. Put your gun down. Cliff, lower your gun nice and slow. CLIFF: No way. No way. He's history. Drop it. I said, lower your gun. What the hell are you talking about? If I put it down now, it's over and you know it. Do it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] You can't just leave me here like this. [COUGHING] RILEY: You got the money. Get a cab. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] You know, Riley and I are really bummed that you're not gonna be there to, um, be his best man. And, you know, no one's ever gonna be able to replace you, but, um, Riley's brother offered to stand in for you. And, um, I knew--I knew you weren't gonna have a problem with that. Actually, I, I wish you guys could have met, because you would have really liked him. I love you, Mark.
