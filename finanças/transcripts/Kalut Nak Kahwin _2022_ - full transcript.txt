Boil the eggs longer. -How long? Four hours. -Pak Lang. I only bought two oil bottles. This will do. We can start cooking. Yes. -Lang. Don't forget about the eggs. Upload, can't wait to wear this tomorrow. Hashtag, finally. "Panic At A Wedding." What are you going to do with all that onions? All that is for the meat curry. That's way too much. It's not meat curry,... ...but onion curry. Don't interfere. I would know as I'm the cook. Just keep quiet. Mind your own business. -Pak Lang. Preparing for feasts like this is rather fun. Of course. Hence, this is communal service. So it's beneficial when you ask everyone to help out. But we'll be in trouble if people don't turn up tomorrow. You're being ridiculous. Well, I'm Pak Lang. Anyway, the villagers listen to what I say. Tomorrow, I'll ask Zaini to get people. Bring them over. You need to finish that..... The ribbon for the money. Mother has done it. -Really? Good. Listen to this, Pak Lang. The current songs are great. Old songs are lame. That's silly. These hip-hop songs are ludicrous. I don't know about hip-hop. The songs of yesteryears are better and nicer. Even your grandparents and parents listen to the oldies. Old songs. Right? You wouldn't understand. A nuisance. Pak Lang. Don't smoke too much. Your lungs are weak. Mind your own business. I know that. The thing is I can't cook without smoking. How am I going to cook? Give me leeway. Okay. Minah, I want to ask you something. Where is your son-in-law from? From the north as well. But his family has moved here. They're all residents of Kuala Lumpur now. What does he do? What is it again? Don't you know what your son-in-law does? Probably sells carpets. Well, she did say. Munirah! What job does your future husband do? He's an architect! -An architect! That's it or you would've gone back. An architect is good. He must be wealthy. I'm getting married tomorrow, not next year Okay, come tomorrow morning then. Who were you talking to? What happened? Munirah? Who were you talking to? Munirah, who were you talking to? -They can't set up the dais... ...by tonight! Are there lot of these eggs boiled? Come on, I'm Zaini. I've boiled more than these. I used to help Pak Lang... ...with feasts in many places. This is not a big deal. You are fantastic. Pak Lang. Buyut, when did you come back? You've appeared out of the blue. In the afternoon. What's your job in Singapore? In the kitchen. I'm a cook, Pak Lang. Pak Lang, his mother fries eggs for him here. But he went to Singapore and became a cook. Shut up. I'm in low spirits now. What happened? He just found out your sister is getting married tomorrow. Serves him right! I went to Singapore in vain,... ...to earn money for our wedding. Upon returning,... ...my lover has been taken away by another man. You didn't go to Singapore because you wanted to marry my sister. Didn't you go there to escape your MLM downlines? What's with you? -Well, that's the truth. You were escaping from them! This is it. Tell me about it. What did you discuss that day? Were they supposed to come during the day or night? Which was it? I discussed with that person last month. They were supposed to come tonight. And why can't they make it tonight? I don't know. I would've asked other people if I knew. What's the problem? -The ones to set up the dais,... ...can't make it tonight. Why? They're coming tomorrow morning. That's crazy? -Yes, they are, brother. If they come tomorrow, I won't be able to do the reception at 2 p.m. So what are you going to do? Just hire someone else. Nobody will accept last minute like this. Just wait for tomorrow. -What if they don't do it in time? It's okay if there is no dais. But the Tok Qadi must be present. Right, mother? We think alike. I like that. I told her to hire Tamrin. Tamrin is good and does a good job. People are always satisfied. Right? It's not that you don't know me. I prefer something new, fresh and young. Why would I hire Mister Tamrin with his ruffles... ...and cascading flowers? Gross! Do people ever get grossed out by ruffles? That's it. She is stubborn and adamant to her ways. So this happens. Excuse me. Mother, so... ...is the ribbon ready? Which one? -The one with money. That ribbon? This is why I refuse to chat. I've forgotten because they started to chat. That's it. Give me the ribbons. Tie it. -Hurry. Pak Lang was asking about it. Why is it so slow? Oh dear. What now? No. I don't cook simple dishes like these. In Singapore, I... ...am a professional cook at an exclusive restaurant. It'll be humiliating to cook here. Humiliating? I don't want him to cook anyway. Probably, nobody would eat if he cooked. People prefer my cooking. Boy! Stop playing with your phone. It'll damage your eyesight. This old man keeps smoking. Your heart will be damaged too. Are you talking back? I'll slap you. Go home! Pak Lang, there are a lot of meat in here. Do we have time to cut tomorrow? Come on, Pak Lang can do it on time. That's for sure. But it won't be fresh tomorrow. If this happens in that expensive restaurant in Singapore,... ...will definitely be rejected. Do you know I've been a cook here for years? I cooked for your parent's wedding reception. You wouldn't know as you weren't born yet. Annoying. Yes, everything is done. You're fast asleep. Wake up. We're having a feast today. I'm telling you to wake up. Come on. I've already dressed up. Brother, wake up. -Wake up. Come on. Wake up. We're having a feast today. Come on. I'm ready. Look, I'm all dressed up. Tell him to go first. -Just wake up. Come and help me. -Ask him to go first. Oh God! What happened? What happened? What is it? A pimple! I rushed in for this? It's just a pimple. Oh God, such chaos. Come on. We haven't completed the goodie bags. Come on. -That pimple is horrible! Mother, I'm getting solemnised today! Why did it appear today? Why are you panicking? When the Tok Qadi comes, he'll do the same. Do you want the solemnisation to be invalid? What's with you? Come on. Get up. -Sister. You're making a fuss because of a pimple. When I had a boil in my backside I didn't shout out to the world. What a fuss. -I don't know. Didn't he tell you? Brother. Put the phone down and help me with this. That's a lot. You're talking back. Quickly, put these in here. This goes in here. Then this is the final one. Yes, Buyut? How could you... ...not wait for me? I sacrificed in a land faraway in vain. What's with you? How silly. That's enough. You don't care about my broken heart. You're funny. Are you unwell? What do you mean? I'm serious. Buyut. I deem you as my own brother. Nothing more, nothing less. Take this. I have lots to do. What are you talking about this early? Pak Lang is waiting. Go and help him. What are you doing? Here. You're the same, Mak Minah! How could you allow Mun to marry another? Give me that wash basin. He wants to be my son-in-law with that attitude? I'm going first! Brother, let me bathe first! You don't have much to do. I have tonnes of tasks. I can't stand it. Is there no water? Mother, where are you? Where is mother? -Why? Mother, is there no water? No water! What kind of look is this? There is no water in the bathroom! What do you mean? It was running earlier. I washed my hands. You're just creating a ruckus. Brother, I said... ...let me shower first! -You're right! There is no water! Panic! -What to do now? Muzamir, ask Pak Lang if there is water outside. What for? -How can you ask that? Quickly, go and ask him. I'm busy. -What do you mean? Quickly, boy! All right. Hurry up! -He's taking his time. Pak Lang. Is the water running here? What do you mean? -Don't you know what water is? Water. -Yes. What type? Coffee, rose syrup or tea? Enough, there are no drinks here. Go home and tell your mother to make her delicious coffee. We need to work here. Bring it over, okay? Go on. Such nuisance about water. Not too sweet. Mother, Pak Lang said there is no coffee. What do you mean by coffee? You asked to inquire about drinks, mother. Water from the tap, not coffee! I seek forgiveness from God. -Calm down. Go again,... ...and ask if there is water. Say that it's tap water. I must walk to and fro tirelessly. I'm busy. No! Why is there no running water today? Why did this pimple appear today? It's water from the tap, not coffee. You asked for water. How was I supposed to know? Pak Lang. -Don't act cute. I'll whack you. No need to pray. Go and see if there is water running. Please. I was just about to eat. Can't you help out? Listen to the leader. Nothing. No water? Sulaiman, what are you waiting for? Hurry up! They're going to cook for a wedding reception. This looks like..... -Enough! Go now! Go on. Lang, what are we going to do? We're having a feast today but there is no water. How could they cut water supply without giving notice? No wonder! Look at this. -That's terrible. What is it? Don't come near. I haven't taken a bath. Calm down. Read it. -"Closure of water supply plant... ...due to polluted water in Sungai Langat." How did Sungai Langat become contaminated? "This stems... ...from the disposal of..... Tok? -Toxic. Toxic! -Toxic... ...which contains hazardous chemicals... ...from nearby factories. Hence,... ...all water supply... ...to all relevant districts has been ceased. Goodness gracious! This is going to cause panic. How am I going to get married? Be patient. You can't wait to get married. We're discussing this water issue. What now? -We're thinking. Think of a way to source for water. Oh no. Peace be upon you. And, upon you too. -Is the event here? What? For the solemnisation. Where should I leave these gas tanks? Just leave it there. In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. Why is it quiet? If this was Madura, there will be a crowd. Where is everyone? Give me a hand. So this will be done quickly. I was just about to eat. That's the way. What is your name? Rahman. That's a nice name. Not lame. The beloved. How should I refer to you as? Pak Rahman? Buyut. Is that so? Rahman is a nice name but you're referred to as Buyut? It's a rather odd name after all. I'm kidding. Don't be mad. Are you from around here? I'm a Malaysian, of course. I'm just trying to be friendly. I'm done. You can leave now. Peace be upon you. I think the tanks are leaking! Immigrant! Pak Lang. The gas tanks are here but..... -Don't interfere! We're in a huge dilemma. What's the problem? Water supply has been cut off. Don't panic. Cancel this reception. We'll postpone it. It's not impossible. You're full of expressions. Want to embarrass me? You're trying to upset me. How awful. This is it. Now, the problem is we don't have water supply. So we need supply. Easy for you to say. How will you do that? Are you going to dig hole? -The petrol station. Can you do that? -Yes, that's normal. Can we really do that? What are you waiting for? Go and fetch water. Go on. -I can't. Why? -We can't... ...transport water with a motorbike. We need a bigger mode of transport. No problem. Ask friends to lend a lorry or van. It would be easy to transport water. Who? -Who do you know? I reckon..... Seman! Yes, Seman! Seman owns a lorry. But he can't drive it as he hasn't paid road tax. Husin! Husin has a tourist bus. -That's bigger. But he's not here. He went to Thailand yesterday... ...to marry another woman. Why is it this difficult? Let me handle this. Is that your car, Buyut? Yes. -You're rich. This is thanks... ...to my job as a professional cook... ...in Singapore. A professional in Singapore? Don't believe him. -It's probably a clone car. That's a good one. No, this isn't a clone. This was an expensive buy. Not a clone. Enough, don't be awestruck by him. Go with him to collect water. Okay, put all the containers in the vehicle. That vehicle. -Come on. The others can continue work, Pak Lang. Okay, let's go. -Come on. Want to come along, Pak Lang? -Just get going. Hurry up. Never mind, we'll go and you can continue working. Hurry up. -Quickly. Hurry back. Is the pay for a professional cook in Singapore high? Of course, they pay a huge sum. A huge sum and I manage my money well. You know how to manage your money now? Yes, managing your money is important. If you're rich, but don't manage your money properly,... ...you'll lose all your money. One more thing, you must go to a foreign land. See how they think. Then you'll progress. There is no running water here too. Really? I think there is no water supply in this area. Well? We'll go to a different area. Come on. Hello, peace be upon you. Where are you? Yesterday,... ...you'll be here in the morning to set up the dais. Look at the time. On the way. All the way from Tokyo? I don't care. I want you here immediately to set up my dais. You can't set it up while the guests are eating! Honey, no need to close your eyes. You promised to come yesterday, but you didn't. And today, you're late. Sorry for being late. How? Is everything okay? No, it isn't. Look. Okay, that's a tiny problem. Let's do the make up now. No, I haven't showered. Why haven't you showered? Quickly, do it now. Come on. Yes! Quickly, bring the containers. Buyut, help me with this. -Okay. I think I need to pray. Now we have water. What's with you? We managed to get water. You brought water. So did you find water? -Come on. That's because I located it. I am Buyut. Take these. Okay. Mun! Quickly, Mun. I'm sorry. My soulmate. Mun? Great, we have water now. Okay. -Mun. She is my friend. She's my bridesmaid... ...and she'll do my makeup too. Smells lovely. What smells good? -Well, mother asked you to bathe. Get ready and smell nice. Hurry up. -Honey, just wait. I'll shower first. Then you can do my make up. Honey? Yes, my name is Honey. Honey as in from bees. When did you arrive? -Just a moment ago. Spending the night here? -No. I'll go home later. That soon? Where is the water? Hold on. God is great. Didn't this guy hear me? Mustakim, there is not enough water... ...to cook and wash. Have you been possessed? Mustakim! There is not enough water. The water. -There is no water. Why? Collect more. We need to wash those. -All right. Buyut, let's go. Oh dear. -Hurry up! Oh you. -He is just slow. Hurry up. You're going with Buyut. Go on. I'm heading off, brother. Brother? Women are complicated. They get confused about their choice too. First, they'll claim to like you. Suddenly, they'll claim to be confused about their choice. That's the thing. I don't understand women sometimes. I don't want to think about women now. And about love. It's a waste of time. Better focus on increasing your wealth now. Money management. That's more important. -"Money". Yes, it's money. Peace be upon you, brothers. It's a sin if you don't respond. -And, upon you too. My boss is angry. You can't take water here. We did it earlier. -That was earlier. Now, the boss is angry. You've collected too much water. No more. -What do we do with all these? You can take these. But you can't take more. The boss is angry. -Okay. Thank you. Sorry. -The boss is angry. Yes, you just have to say it once. The boss is angry. -Okay, let's go. Well, he's repeating it as though we don't understand. The boss is angry. -Yes, I know! That's enough. -This Malay guy is scolding me. Look, that Malay guy punched me. See? The guy with the red sunglasses. My boss is angry. Don't be a slave to money. Let money work for us. What does that mean? You shouldn't work for money. Let money work for us. Do you understand? Doesn't look like you do. It's okay, if you don't understand. I'll teach you. Okay. What's going on? Brother, sorry for disturbing you. Can you step out for a minute? -Who are they, Buyut? I don't know. -Don't be afraid. Just come out. Who are you? With your chains and all. We're repossessing this vehicle. Because it hasn't been paid for. I paid for this car. But this car is in our records. This car is under my friend's name. I'm paying him. I am. Help! Stop it! What's with you? That's enough! What do we do now? Hail a driver! Call for it now! -I'm going to do it now! And, she left just like that? Apparently, so. Said it was an emergency. What did you want me to do? Can't get you... ...as you were showering. So she left. But she said, she's not charging for it. She did it for free, except... ...you have to set it up yourself. Great. That's wonderful. There you go. You're stubborn. I told you earlier... ...to ask Tamrin. He would've done it by now. But you refused. You said Tamrin... ...has too many ruffles, ugly and isn't modern. You wanted something modern. Now do it yourself. Mother, I'm extremely upset. You're not supporting me at all. Support? How can I not support you? Get married at the airport. There you go... ...for being stubborn. No, this load is too heavy. You need to hire a lorry for this. My car is not big enough. I've to cancel this. Never mind, I'll give you a bad rating. I don't care about your rating. As long as my car isn't ruined. Please? Not a chance. Get off. Please? I'll teach you all about money management. Get off! Hang on. It's you again, friend. Disappointed? I would like to ask for your help. Sure, but what are these? Hurry up. How fortunate. Okay. Do you know... ...this is my employer's motor? It's all right. I'll pay later. No, it is..... No, we'll do it again later. Smell it. It smells of..... Where is your expensive vehicle? It's a long story. A long story? No need to tell everything. Shorten it. And this is crucial. Go and check on your sister. What happened? -Just go and see her. There is another problem. Go and see her. The water problem isn't settled. Now, there is more? -They can settle this, okay. You and see her. -Isn't that right? I'll whack you. Where is my payment? Wait up! You promised, so have to pay! This is too much. I don't know how to do this. Just help to arrange these. It's easy. No, I really don't know how to do this. Sorry. Buyut. Can you help me? You want to marry someone else. But you want me to set the dais up? It's okay. For your sake,... ...with a tormented heart,... ...I will help to set it up. What do you mean? Who is going to get the water? I forgot about the water. Okay, why don't I set up the dais? Both of you can get water. Wonderful! Both of us will set up the dais. Buyut, get water. Just now you said it's too much of work. That you don't know how to do this. I can't let her do it alone. In that case, I'll do my own makeup. I'll watch tutorials or something. Help me set this up, okay? Thank you, Honey. Okay, I'll touch up later. Okay. -Be careful. How do we do it? -All these. Yes, where shall we begin? What is your name? -I am Mustakim. But you can call me Mus. But you can endearingly call me Takim. Takim? I'm Buyut. But you can endearingly... ...call me Bu. Bu? My name is Sulaiman. My endearing moniker is Sulaiman too. Don't refer to me as "Su" or "Lai". Those are horrible. What's this? Mun? Munirah! I've come to see you. Listen. You have to do this. Call your future husband and delay a bit. It's okay if they're late. It'll be a problem if he arrives on time. Can we do that, mother? Think about it. Oh God. Imagine if he arrives... ...and sees the dais is not ready... ...and there is no food. Who would be embarrassed? I will be embarrassed. Okay, but what do you want me to say? The Tok Qadi has been admitted to the hospital? Yes, he's in the hospital. So what do we do now? Can we delay it a little? You're supposed to be here by 12 noon. Now, you can come at 3 p.m. Because we need to find a replacement for the Tok Qadi. Okay, then. Well, this can't be helped. Okay, dear. Bye. Okay, bye. That's my girl. Continue doing your makeup. I'm going to continue cooking, okay? Thank you, mother. Passed away? -Not yet. Just admitted to the hospital. What do I do now? Not yet. So relax. After the rain, comes the rainbow. You're good. Doesn't look nice. Men are like that. They're impatient. How is that relevant? You're complaining before seeing the outcome. It's incomplete. It'll look beautiful once it's done. Here, look at this. Okay. Sorry. Like that? -Right? These days they use recycled wood for dais? That's the trend. You have to follow trends, right? Is it a trend? Honey, if you plan to get married,... ...will you use the same kind of dais? I haven't thought about that yet. You need to think about that now. It'll be easier. What do you mean? Yes. It's nothing. I'm not too concerned about a dais. I'm more concerned about who my future husband is. What kind of man will you choose? I prefer a guy who isn't very handsome. He has to be a simple person. Most importantly, he is a Malay. I love men who are funny. Peace be upon you. And, upon you too. You are absolutely beautiful. I am enchanted. I'm referred to as Din the Speaker. I've come to perform my task. Mak Minah called... ...and ordered a karaoke set. Is this Mak Minah's wedding reception? You're right, mister. This is a wedding reception organised by Mak Minah. But she isn't getting married. Her daughter, Munirah is getting married. Was that funny? -Yes, it was. Who are you? Me? I'm Mustakim. Mak Minah's son. Munirah the bride is my younger sister. So where is the karaoke spot? Lang are all these okay? Yes, they are. The problem is, we have insufficient water. Buyut. Hasn't he returned? -He is not reliable. He's hopeless. He's not back with even a drop of water. Lang. That's enough. You're ruining your lungs with too much of that. It's dangerous. Mind your own business. I've been smoking for a long time. Speaking of that,... ...you've been saying the same thing since back then. So,... ...when the ashes come this way,... ...it'll kill me first, not you. Don't worry. I know about safety. Anyway, I'm sitting far away. Annoying, stupid old woman. Pass it to me later. Excuse me, brother. You're not allowed to take water here. Am I not allowed to take some? You're not allowed to take any amount. Not even a bit? You're not allowed to take whatever amount you want. Be quiet and stay calm. Let me talk. Why can't we take water? That is because..... Wait, this phone is..... Look at this. Who is this? Look at this face with red glasses. Check this out. Hello. Well, did you manage to collect water? We can't get any. The petrol stations won't allow it. What? What now? I'll try to sort this out. You can handle what is necessary. I'll deal with it. Okay, hurry up. They need it for cooking. Hurry up. Okay, bye. From earlier? Hurry then. Pak Lang. Buyut failed to fetch water. Why depend on him? I don't trust him. Where are we going to source for water now? Never mind, he's finding water. He can do it. -He won't find it. Then, I'll do this. I'll go to the grocer and buy big mineral water bottles. Would they have stock? Many people would've bought those. I think they should have. -Okay. Go on. -Hurry. We're going for prayers. Praise God. We're blessed. What do you mean? Over there. We'll get water. They have water in there. We'll get water from the mosque. Isn't that stealing? What do you mean? -Stealing. Stealing from the house of God. You can go but don't drag me into hell. I can't enter. And why is that? I haven't been cleansed. -What do you mean? To be cleansed by ablution. In that case,... ...you can't enter. Where should I go? I can't go in. You're troublesome. We'll go to another place. How many kids do you have? I don't have kids. Aren't you married? No. Then, why haven't you cleansed with ablution water? Enough, let's just go! This is a matter of single people. You won't know. -In that case, you're married. Aren't you single? My pimple is still visible. Look, the foundation must be thicker. So it can be covered, okay. I'm totally stressed out today. Do you know I'm frustrated? Why are you frustrated? Well, many things are going wrong on my wedding day. First, this pimple which is as big as a bus. Then there is no water supply. The person who was supposed to do the dais caused problems. Okay, Mun. Calm down. The challenges of being happy is tough. But if you manage to overcome all this,... ...believe me, you'll be the happiest person. There are solutions to all difficult situations. Okay? Inhale. Cleanse your lungs. Thank you, Honey. Luckily you are here. This bride is so cute. Let's settle this problem. Cover this. Boss, do you have the big mineral water bottle? I've run out of that. -Oh dear. The small bottles? -Ran out too. Why is there nothing left? There is no water supply here. Okay, thank you. It's good to do this. We've been going around in my vehicle. I've got a headache. -A little while... ...and you've a headache. I've been busy since morning. Just to ensure the reception goes well. But it's none of my business. I don't even know who is getting married. But I've been riding around. By right,... ...I was supposed to be the groom. Go on. That's the thing. It's not visible! She can't see what's in front of her. Hello, Koh Ah Sun. Yes, the vehicle is giving problem again. Yes, it's raining. Friend, make rain sounds. What? -Rain sounds. Well, it's raining heavily. Yes! Hello? Well done. I think... ...I know... ...where to pinch water from. Don't do it. It's a sin. Well, you lied to your boss. Isn't that a sin? Will the owner... ...of WYD 6134 move your vehicle... ...because you're blocking traffic. Yes, to those working out there. Looks like you're busy. All of you are attending to your duties and responsibilities. We'll I'm doing the same here as well. When the feast isn't happening, play some music. Do you want to sing, uncle? If you want to sing. Do you want a karaoke session? Well,... ...what do you mean by that? I am Tok Qadi. Where is the couple who is about to get solemnised? Pak Lang, they've all run out of mineral water. Everything? How is that possible? Did you try all the shops? What now? We've to wash the chicken. Which shop did you go to? -I went to all the shops. Everything has been cleared out. -Oh God! I have a headache. Now it hurts. -Calm down. This is it. Why don't we..... We'll tell the groom to come a little later. Don't do that. I told Munirah to delay it until 3 p.m. How much longer to delay? I can't take it. What to do? Buyut isn't back with water. It'll be embarrassing if the reception is cancelled. I'll be humiliated. Not just you, I'll be embarrassed too. Because they know I'm the cook here. You know I'm well-known. Never mind, I'll inform Munirah. I need to set up the dais. It's a crucial thing. Mother. Tell Honey that I'll wait for her in the hall. Announcement! Attention, Mak Minah. He mother of the bride that the Tok Qadi is here... ...and is standing next to me now. A message by Tok Qadi. Where is the bride? Is the wedding on? Other If it's cancelled, I'll head to another venue. This isn't my only reception. I have many more ceremonies to handle. So is this happening? All right, Tok Qadi is here. But we can't do anything anyway. You need to speak to him. Tok. -Yes. I apologise. I am Mustakim. The brother of the bride. This is the mother of the bride. -Yes. Good. It's happening. This solemnisation is happening. Except,... ...I ask for your kind understanding... ...to give us a little more time. Why? I'll tell you. There is a slight problem in this area now. I really want to help. But I have to hurry. There are four couples I need to marry today. I need to solemnise them. -That's a lot. Yes. This is before Dhuhr. One, after Dhuhr. Another one after Asr. Another one after Isha. Until at night. Listen. If... -Yes? When I see your face,... ...you look like a good person. Honest and sincere. I know you'll accept this. If you can make adjustments,... ...I'll be relieved. Make adjustments? By God's grace. I'll make adjustments with the other couples,... ...if possible. But I won't make promises. Only if possible. Looking at you, I'm sure it's possible. I'm relieved now. Now, you can rest. Yes. -You can look around. I need to continue work. Angah. I'll leave now. Go ahead. Are you married? -No. No? When? Soon. -Soon? Do you have a candidate? Yes, but I haven't asked her. You must hurry. Once you've confirmed, let me know early. Because I'm fully booked. People are always calling me. -It's obvious. Come, let's have a seat. Right here. Mother! Honey, Mustakim is back. Can you help him out? There are a lot more things to do. All right, aunty. Okay. Mun, you're done. Later, touch up with some blush. And you're all set. All right. Thank you, Honey. -Okay? Aunty. Mother. Is the Tok Qadi here? Did I hear the announcement right? That's he's here? -I've come to tell you that. No matter what happens,... ...you've to call Amar and tell him... ...you need a bit more time. You keep saying that. We extended from 12 noon to 3 p.m. How much longer? No, what will they say. -Whatever it takes. Don't play the fool. -I can't do anything anymore. My head is muddled. In five minutes..... Suddenly, I want to give up. I can't do this anymore. Stop, mother! The challenges of being happy is tough. But if you manage to overcome all this,... ...believe me, you'll be the happiest person! There are solutions to all difficult situations. Seriously? We have to delay further? Okay. Listen. Okay, if there is a problem,... ...just tell me and we'll solve it together. Okay? Okay, bye. Brother, it's getting weirder. It's okay, we'll just relax. Maybe they're facing a problem we're not aware of. Straight. Right. Turn to the right. Brother, are you going to swim first? What are you doing? You're stealing water! Brother. No, don't do that..... Run! -Let's go! Grab all these! Why do they all look the same? Who? They're all the same. -No, they're different people. It's the same person. Yes, they all look alike. That's true. They're always wherever I go. Don't do that. -What do you mean? He's doing the job he's been entrusted with. He's an immigrant in my land. But how can he be in charge? This land belongs to God. God's provision is vast. Bigger than your mind. You know how to speak. When you're in another man's land,... ...this is how you're treated, right? I don't know. -I speak the truth. Use your head. Let's go! Don't run! Come back! Where are you running off to? Come back! Honey. I'm going home for a while. Why? I left something there. Okay. Brother. The sky is clear today. Look. Do I stink that bad? Don't exaggerate. Enough! Zaini, where is the water container that was here? Where are you going with that? -To take a bath. That water is for cooking. It's not enough for a bath. I haven't taken a bath today. Smell. What is there isn't enough water to cook? Don't think about that. If I wasn't responsible,... ...I wouldn't have bothered, right? Okay. -Wait. The challenges of being happy is tough. But if you manage to overcome all this,... ...you'll be the happiest person. And... ...there are solutions to all difficult situations. Now you look handsome. I know I'm handsome. Do I smell good? -Yes. Do you like it? -Yes. Announcement. A request for the host's son, Mister Mustakim... ...to come to the karaoke table now... ...due to an important matter. Just wait here. I have an important business. Mister Mustakim. Brother. Why must you summon using the speaker? I always do that. Hence people refer to me as Din Speaker. Okay. What is it Din Speaker? The snake is bitten by a monitor lizard. Someone is here for you. I am Haikal. -Haikal who plays the kompang? One, two, three! Since we're already here,... ...we should eat first. While we wait for the bridegroom to arrive. You want to eat first? This is it. Sit in this hall first. I'll let you know when the food is ready. Practice first, okay. Practice first? -We're here. Right. We should've come here to begin with. We were riding around everywhere. So use your head. It's not my fault, but Pak Lang's. I asked what happens during a communal work without water. This will happen. A reception... ...should be done by caterers to make things easier. There is a reason I organised this communal work. I want the tradition to continue. Yes, it's a tradition. -Yes. With that tradition,... ...we can bring everyone together. Yes, it'll unite us. -Unite. See in the city, houses like near that park,... ...they don't even know the neighbours. Yes, they don't. -They don't. So sometimes I invite people to do communal work. But they give excuses and are lazy. True. -Right? But never imagined our water supply would be cut off. Never expected it. -Didn't expect it? Your life is easy. You just agree to what I say. Yes, I'm adhering to the script. That's all you do? No wonder. Our dais is finally ready. Our dais? Mak Minah is pay cash for this job. Let's practice properly. Mister Mustakim. What's with you? We're done with the practice. Can we eat now? You want to eat? Can you wait a while? The food isn't ready. Hurry up! Splashed a bit and you're angry. Quickly. Splashed a bit and you're angry. So it's like that? Did you know? It's cooling here. Wonderful and chilling. Let's go. They are waiting for the water. Let's go. But I'm thirsty. Let's get a drink first. There is water everywhere here. Just drink it. Can you drink that? This is pure water. You can use this as ablution. Really? -Try it. See? What do you think? Good? It's good! Drink up. Tastes like mineral water. But it's not bottled. So cooling. It's wonderful. So are we really getting married, dear? Yes, we are. There is just a slight delay. Or are you looking for excused to not marry me? You keep delaying this. That's not it. Well, are you trying to embarrass my family and me? Can you just be patient? I have so many problems to deal with now. Sounds illogical. Unless you're hiding something from me now. Are you hiding something? Okay, actually..... Hello? Brother, what's happening? Are you getting married? I have to go back to Johor Bahru. Dead? Mother, she hung up suddenly. Let whatever happen. Let's go now. -Come on. What are you doing there? We're collecting water, uncle. You can't use that water. The water here is contaminated. There is toxic residue. It's poisonous. Didn't you hear it on the news? No. -That's the problem with you. Many have been admitted at the hospital... ...because they swam in there. Did you understand what he said? I didn't understand. Honey. Can I ask you something? Sure. Do you believe in love at first sight? Yes, I do. You do? I believe because... ...I'm in the midst of experiencing it. Me too. Previously,... ...I never fancied Malay men. But since I met this person,... ...I fell in love with him instantaneously. Mustakim! What are we going to do? Buyut hasn't come back. He hasn't returned? Never mind, I'll call him. Hello. Mustakim. Please send my regards to Munirah. Tell her... ...I hope she is happy... ...although she didn't choose me. What are you rambling about, idiot? I need water. When will you return? I managed to get it, Mus. But it's toxic. Toxic? Hello? Buyut? This is your fault. Mustakmal water. Mustapha Kamal water. Dirty water. My stomach hurts like hell! Excruciating. Now, I want you to go to all the houses... ...and tell them our feast is delayed, okay? I'm busy. What are you doing? There are so many houses here. I've to knock on all the doors. You should go now. You better go before I whack your face. You had to force me to do this. Is there a problem? No, Tok. That's good. Because I need to solemnise another couple. What about my sister? Has she done the marriage contract? No. Never mind, I'll solemnise the others now. We'll keep in touch via the phone. But Tok..... -It's okay. Don't worry. We must trust God's plan. Everything will fall into place. Peace be upon you. -And, upon you too. I'll head off. Peace be upon you. And, upon you too. Pity, Mun. But that's normal. The challenges of being happy is tough. But if you manage to overcome all this,... ...we'll be the happiest person. There are solutions to all difficult situations. Where did you hear that? I made it up. You can read what's in my heart? Peace be upon you. And, upon you too. Where is that old man? Peace be upon you. And, upon you too. Tok Qadi! Pak Lang. How are you? -Wonderful. Praise God. Well,... ...I want to ask you something. Why were you mooning away there? You're sulking. Well, I'm very worried. Because the reception is about to start but we haven't cooked. This reception? -Yes. Pak Lang, this is it. The reception isn't important. You can postpone it to another day. The crucial part,... ...is the marriage contract ceremony. That must be done first. That is compulsory. The reception can be done on another day. Hello, the fire station. It's okay. It has been settled. I managed to put out the little fire. I panicked earlier. I'm sorry. You panicked. Call us when you actually need us. This is all Pak Lang's fault. He throws cigarette butts everywhere. Mister, is there water in the truck? Yes. They have water! We can bathe now. Enough. -Take that. Okay, carry that. No, go on. Your turn. Soon we'll be relatives. We'll settle unfinished business. Today is a happy day for our kids. Thank you. -That's great. Actually, we're biding the kinship between two families. So it's good that everyone comprehends. Right? -Thank you, Tok Qadi. I'm relieved. Thank you very much. Don't you want to eat first? It's okay. We're on standby. We need to go back. There may be fire at another reception. Just kidding. -Really? We'll head off. -Thank you. You're welcome. We'll be off. Thank you. Peace be upon you. -And, upon you too. Hello. Who are you looking at? If you're interested,... ...quickly take action. If you're late,... ...it'll be a waste. What do you mean? Love. Love appears at the right time. Don't wait too long. Someone else may steal her away. But people say... ...you'll end up together if it's fated. It's true, it'll happen due to fate. But you must work for it. If you don't,... ...it'll be a stupid thing. Understood? -Yes. Mustakim. How nice. All the problems are solved. As I said, there are solutions to all difficult situations. I didn't expect this. Our feast is happening. Our feast? Honey, I need to tell you something. What is it? I know it's not the right time now. And the ceremony is about to begin. And I don't know when we'll meet again. Okay? -Yes. I actually like..... My Honey! Dear! Honey? -Dear. I want to introduce you to Mustakim. He is Munirah's brother. Hello, do you mind if I spoke in English? My name is Kamal. Kamal. Kamal is my fiance. Fiance? -Done. We're getting married next month. Congratulations. -Thank you, Mustakim. He is the Malay man I referred to earlier. The first time we met, we fell in love immediately. Right, dear? -You're sweet. Mustakim. Sorry, what were you going to say? Like what? Just like. As the water problem is over. The ceremony has begun. I really like that. I accept the solemnisation with Munirah Binti Rahman... ...with a dowry of RM200 in cash. Agreed? Yes. -Praise God. Sulaiman. Does your stomach still hurt? I don't think so. I feel stronger. My stomach doesn't hurt anymore. But I'm famished. I feel like eating meat... ...or brains. Goodness! Why do you look like that? You look terrible. -Well,... ...what's wrong with you? You look horrible too. You look mentally disturbed.
