Why? For the fag. Hey, Pasinni... What? Got a fag? Yes, but no matches. I'll ask Polin. Polin? - Why? He's a jerk. - Really? I'm just saying... - We'll see. Don't burn yourself. What's up? Got a match? Yes, I've got 3 left. Want a drag? This is one of Fiori's fags. Yes, Passini got them. Olivera's fags are trash. He only smokes black. He smokes them this short... ...they burn your mouth. Did they lock the front door? - Yes they did... Ernesto. What about me? - I'm coming. Don't waste time with him. Tomorrow I'll get you, understand? We're amongst traitors. If I ever catch the one, I'll kill him. Is the padlock big? - What? The padlock on the front door. Is it big? Don't know. I haven't seen it. Want another drag? No, it's ok. Well, bye then. Bye, Ernesto. Tomorrow, I'll give you a fag. Here you are. Take it. I was talking about him. Why, did you feel neglected? Tomorrow, I'll fight him. Why not now? Hey Polin. See you in the showers tomorrow. Understood? You see? He doesn't answer. Maybe he's asleep. You're on his side. I'm going to break his face. Who takes charge of it? My mother. Who do you think? Hey, Oreja, can I borrow your sister? Oh, shut up. Hey, Oreja. Bring back the towel. So? Are you going to fight or not? Who cares. Look, Polin is over there. I challenged him last night. Do you want me to call him? - Ok. Hey, Gimunez. What's up? Keep watch. So? Ok then. What if Fiori turns up? I'll keep watch. Ok, hit me. - You hit me. Thump him. - Hit me. No, you hit me. Come on Passini, kill him. - Yes, kill him. Aren't you the thug? I'm not the thug. Come on you sissies. Watch out. Now, guys. That was very wrong. Start cleaning the stairs Both of you. But Sir... It's easy through the infirmary. You think? Yes, it's the only place left. That's great. Look at Ernesto. He's looking after my fag. 93 Don't know... I need to break an arm. Are you crazy? Just use blotting paper. Forget about it. Attention. Perez Alza. - Yes. Domingo Florio. - Yes. Huctor Mansilla. - Yes. Jorge Cobian. - Yes. Outside! Ricardo Rey. - Yes. The rest keep on working. Hi, Polin. What are you doing here? I don't know, I was sent here. I have fever. Mumps? - No, no, I've got fever. Where is Mr. Benitez? He'll be here in a minute. Ask Benitez to stay here and you'll have a great time. Yes, of course. I would like that. If you have fever he'll allow you to stay. Yes, sure. I do have fever. Hey, Polin. Have you seen my mother? No, I haven't. Hey, Polin. Sing for us. I don't want to. Maybe later. What are you doing here? I was sent here, Sir. I've got fever. What did you eat today? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing. I had no visits. What's your name? Rosas. Celed?n Rosas. You ran away before, didn't you? So, you didn't eat anything? ...not even candies? You're an escapee. Give me your shoes. The other one too. No, Sir. 'Be careful, I'm an escapee.' 1-2-3-4. 1-2-3-4. May I go to the bathroom? 1-2... ...3-4... ...1-2-3-4... ...and... rest. Sir. Sir. - Please, please. Gentlemen: The lesson ends... ...at 4PM sharp. Understood? If I had not pulled his hair... It's incredible how hard Polin hits. 'Flaco' Manrique beat him up once. Be careful with the Lion. You can beat him. You know who can beat him? Who do you think Polin is, Tarzan? Shut up. Why don't you beat him?. What's up? I knew it. Where did you sleep last night? They marked you. Did they hit you? No, ... I just stared at them. They didn't hit you? Where did you sleep? In the cubicle. No one is checking there. Are you allowed you to be here? What was the window like? Beautiful. Really beautiful. But they caught me right at that very moment. I was almost outside... ...hanging from the window... ...when two old ladies passed by and shouted... 'He's running away.' What a shame. What did you do? Nothing. I was about to jump... ...when Fiori and Benytez arrived... ...and a man in the street that gave me away. Just at that very moment. Did they found out about the blotting paper? Are you crazy? A big racket was made. I thought you had escaped. The streets are waiting. I'm leaving any moment. I'm coming with you. Benitez is always the traitor How long are you going to mourn? I don't know. Why did he die? Who knows. My sister told me. Maybe you can leave now. When my grandfather died they allowed me to leave. Maybe. How lucky. If you leave, run away. Why don't you stop? It would be good if they paid... ...a monthly pension at retirement. What? Turn your face to the wall. The problem is that there are no vacancies. I've been talking about that ... ...3-4-5... ...6-7... ...10... Hey, Fiaca. Do you want to play cards? What's the matter? Nothing, I'm just fed up. Get out of here. Stop playing victim. Chirola. Hey, Passini. You're here because of your sister, aren't you? Nonsense, people talk nonsense. Come on, what did you do? I told you that is nonsense. Was she pretty? - No. She was thin and had pimples. Her face was full of pimples. And she shouted when she spoke. She shouted a lot. What's up '100 miles', are you tired? A little bit. Have you got a fag? Here you have a light. Give it to him. I don't know. Every time I out I say to myself: Don't get into trouble... ...but... ...in the streets ... ... I just can't help it. The same happens to me. Why is that? You want to have your cake... ...and eat it. Can't you see? It's like this: If you're a thief, you'll always be one. Quiet. Form a line, quietly. Come on. Quiet. Rosas. Rosas. Come over here. Sir? - Come over here. Put your arms down. I saw you sitting down. Tell me... ...what did I order you to do? To go around the place, Sir. You're unbearable. You're disgusting. You're a rotten apple. You're corrupting the other boys. I didn't do anything. What are you doing here? Fiori... Fiori... Fiori... I. To Fiori? He'll kill you. Excuse me. Come on in. They told me you've been behaving very badly. No Sir, not bad. What's your name? Rosas. Celed?n Rosas. Sir? Mister Suarez? Mister Suarez, may I go to the bathroom? Sir... Sir. Mister Suarez. Excuse me, Sir. What's that pig doing? Oh, you came. What are you doing here? I ran away, mum. They punished me, so I left. Shut up. With you shouting around here, I won't be able to get up in the morning. What's happened to him, Germinda? It's Jacinto. He was working on a building site... ...when he fell down. He was drunk. You can sleep with me tonight. Tomorrow we'll see what we do. Will the wake take place here? Can I go? Are you going to shut up now? Shut up, son. But is he here? You'll see him tomorrow. Who shaved your head. The conscription, my friend. - Did they let you go? No, I ran away. You know every trick in the book, don't you? Have you heard what happened to Jacinto? He fell. - He crashed. He was drunk. Fish. Fresh fish. Fresh fish, lady. ...and he fell down. Eight floors, my friend. Have you seen him? No, I haven't. Can you serve me, Mr. Pedro? - I'm coming. The wake might be interesting. What would you like? A pack of 'Mate', a quarter of sugar... ...a package of 'Gavilan' and a lighter. Please, it's on the list. My mother said that there's going to be trouble. Why? - People say he didn't fall down. They say someone pushed him because of something he knew... ...but the truth is he was drunk. Look. Go and give this to my mother. I don't want to go to prison. - Go. Don't be stupid. No, no, no. Once I was a witness... ...and they had me back and forth for 3 months. I'm not a fool. Please lady, it's only routine. Can't I have peace in my own home? Do you think he was killed? So? What happened? Nothing. I gave it to her and left. Why don't we go to the river? It must be nice. They came looking for me, didn't they? I don't know. Your mother didn't say anything. Have you seen Chaplin? - Yes. What a pity that nowadays it's less popular. Where to? The lake. The other day, the fruit seller's son was there... ...with other 3 boys. They mocked me... ...but I hit one of them... ...and they didn't bothers me after that. Is he going to be buried today? - Who? Jacinto, who do you think? I whistle better than you. You sound like a rotten bird. I'll practice more. You'll see. Didn't I tell you? There they are. Alright. Hey. Come here. Hey, 'Flaco' let me go. I'm drowning. Aren't you getting in? No, you take a swim. Hey, 'Flaco'. Hey, 'Flaco'. What's up with your hair? The 'shaver brigade' caught you? He's not a male Martian... ...he's a female one. Sissies. My clothes. Let's go over there. Shit. If they come near my neighbourhood, I'll kill them. I swear I'll kill them. Why don't we leave? Why? Are you scared? Don't get mad, 'baldy boy'. See what I mean? - They won't hurt you. If they get any closer, I'll smash their faces. You'll see. Aren't you getting in? No, you take a swim. The heat is stifling. Why don't we go over there? OK, let's go. Let's play 'blind frog'. Hey, you prick. Give me a drag. Did your friend get scared? No. Why? - Don't know. Cause he left. What's that? A frog's pen. Aren't you getting in? Can you swim? Yes, sure. - So? I've just eaten. Oh. Do you want this? No. What for? - Don't know. For the pen. You only have to shout: 'Taste the red watermelon' I don't know, I feel embarrassed. Why? Look. Taste the yummy red watermelon. So? Will you do it? It's easy... ...and you're always earning your own money. I'll probably like it, walking along the road all day. Sit down. We don't eat people. So? What do you think? - OK. This boy is cool. Let's see. Taste the yummy.... ...red watermelons. Watermelons are in season. OK then. Say it. Buy, buy the watermelon. Shit, I can't do it. I'm embarrassed. I'll try later. Hey you, stop it. Hey, what do you want? Polin. What happened? I was over there. What did they do to you? I couldn't see anything. This is his wife.

Good to see you. Did you win the jackpot? No, I didn't. Yesterday I pick-pocket a jerk on the bus. I see. What are you looking for? Mar del Plata? Who? I was just thinking did they go on holiday.

Next time you wash your hands first. Bastard. Pimp. She is angry. She is an old bitch. I know her. You still got the horse. Yes I do, but I'm buying a car next month. A 'Ford'. It's a little old but it's a 'Ford'. How nice. Yeah. I'm selling him. Do you want him? I can hold on to him for you. How much can you give me? Well, I could get... Really? What? I mean... Are you actually selling him to me? Of course, I will. Look, do me a favour. Tell Arturo I'll be back tonight. Tell him to have everything ready. Ready what? - Just tell him, he'll know. Hey, Fabian. Fabian. He's beautiful... He's really beautiful. Hey, Fabian. Hey, Fabian. Take him slowly, he's skinny. Good evening... It's my turn, isn't it? - Yes, go in. Go away. Fucking dog. Bye. - Bye. Can I go in? - Yes, you can. Take this. Eat it. A skinny, pot-bellied horse. Your mine... Uh. Poor thing. ...with all this stuff. Do you want grass? Fresh grass? Let's go. You silly. Come on. It's better over here. What are you doing with that horse? I was just playing. Where do you live? Round the block. Your head is shaved you liar. You run from detention, didn't you? No, I'm not. See you. Bye. Where are you going? Home. They're waiting for me. You come with me now. The Captain wants to see you. I don't know him. But he knows you. Come on, be a good boy. Don't do this to me. I haven't done anything. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? I'll bring you back later. I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything, Sir. Let me go. I've already told you. I didn't do anything. I haven't done anything. Anything. - Come here. Let me go. Okay... I'll bring you back later. Come on, stand up. Behave yourself. I thought you were smarter than that. Can't you see, you're acting like a fool?
