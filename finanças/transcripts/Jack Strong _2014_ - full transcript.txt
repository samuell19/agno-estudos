Everyone out of the building. Right now! That's an order! Hurry up, comrades! There's nothing to see here. Comrade colonel, we have the convicted prisoner, Oleg Penkovsky. I have the sentence. - To be read out before... - That won't be necessary. Ivanov, you can't... not bury me. God, save me. - Lord, have mercy on me. - Into the furnace with him. No! You can't do this! Ivanov, no! God, oh God, no!!! May 17, time: 23:17. Interrogation of Colonel Ryszard Kuklifiski. Resumed following a technical break. Session 11. Zygmunt Nowakinterrogating. When you decided to start collaborating, the Penkovsky affair was still fresh. I often thought of how Oleg Penkovsky met his end. He was convicted by a court martial in Moscow of spying for the USA and executed by firing squad in May 1963, I think it was. Sooner or later, every spy, ours or theirs, is exposed and ends up like Penkovsky. - You knew you'd be caught too. - Correct, I did. We stopped at your planning the "Shield 68" maneuvers. In the fall of '68, Russia wanted to deflect the world's attention from its clashes with China along the Amur river. So they decided to come up with something even more spectacular. Large-scale maneuvers by Warsaw Pact forces in the German Democratic Republic. I worked on them day and night... Our genius comrade is here. You're another Kutuzov, comrade major. Notjust Kutuzov. You're Kutuzov and Suvorov rolled into one! You just forgot to give us the names of all the other geniuses in the planning staff who collaborated with you on this project. All their names, please... I can't give you any other names. I prepared the entire plan myself. You did the work yourself? The work of a dozen people? Yes, comrade general, myself. Well done! But where did you get the data for the strategic assumptions? From staff officers in Berlin. And the rest, all the details for tactical units, you did alone? Yes, comrade. Well done! We'll send a congratulatory letter to your Minister of Defense. You're free to go, comrade major. No, don't get UP- Now we can talk. You know they've cancelled the maneuvers? - What? Why? - Because of you. I don't understand. You reconstructed the real plans the Soviets have for war with NATO. The original ones? They didn't even have time to send them to all their units, and you presented identical ones as a training exercise! They're planning an offensive strike against NATO? They say Kulikov personally worked on itforfour years. A spoiling attack on Germany isn't exactly in accordance with socialist military doctrine. And you did it in three months. ls something wrong? So, to repel the attack, the Americans will use weapons of mass destruction: atomic and hydrogen bombs. And? They'll launch 300 warheads at us, at the first and second attacks. They'll wipe out every city and turn Poland into one huge fucking Hiroshima. They have nothing against us, but as they'll have to stop the Soviets... - Who knows about this? - Everyone who needs to. - Everyone? Meaning who? - You want Comrade Wiesiaw to talk to the Americans directly, to go over the Soviets' heads? NotComrade Wiesiaw... I could... assign you to Washington as an attaché. We're just speculating here. There won't be any war. We have to trust in God's mercy. Citizen major! - Don't forgetthis... - Thank you, good night. - Hi. - Hi. - Have you been crying? - How was it in Moscow? Acomplete success. I met Kulikov. - He's back? - From where? Czechoslovakia. Yes. In Prague it's all over for them. - The Spring is over. - Summer? Some guy supposedly doused himself with paint thinner, and then set himself on fire. At the harvest festival, right in front of Cyrankiewicz and Gomékka. - Why would he do that? - From shame. That's why you were crying? Ryszard... If it happens here, we won't give up like the Czechs, will we? Dad! Is he ours? Can we teach him to fetch? - And carry dispatches? - Whafll we call him? Szarik? Civvy. We'll call him Civvy, right, dad? Calm down! It's a she, and her name is Zuza. But can we teach him to fetch? And play dead? Our neighbor's dachshund knows how to play dead. Her! You heard it's a she, moron. - You're the moron. - Boys! Calm down. I'll take the dog. Back to bed! You can play with her tomorrow, before you go to school. I'll getup at six! Or even earlier... - Like hell you will! - Calm down. Attention! - Fall out! - Yes sir! You don't salute a bare head. Let me have her. She's beautiful. - Coming to bed? - In a while... You needn'thurry. I've gotcompany. What's up? What's that pile of junk doing by the gate? Hi! Things are hotting up in Gdansk. We're monitoring the police band. Apparently, there's casualties. One person's dead for sure. What do you mean "dead"? Killed? Shot'? Who was shooting? Fucking heroes in blue uniforms. It wasn't us, was it? Not sure. They say the 32nd mechanized has been on alert since yesterday. Rakowiecki went to Gdafisk yesterday. Marian? What for? It sure is cold. They've got it rough up there. A group of young people... ...it's a scandal... ...it's probably about... ...the blood of children... Do you understand any of this? Turn itup. ...it's making a terrible impression... ...it needs to be cleaned up... Vehicle commanders, fall in! What is this? The country's in crisis, and you lot are listening to the radio? If you've nothing to do, I'm sure I can find you something. Like shoveling snow! Fallout! Fuckingjobsworth! 3,2,1... Happy New Year 1971! Play the national anthem, OK? Poland has not yet succumbed, As long as we remain. What the foe by force has seized, Sword in hand we'll gain. March! March, Dqbrowski! March from Italy to Poland! Marian, you were in Gdafisk. Who gave the order? How's it going? - Careful! - Sorry. "Wiesiaw". "After a warning shot at the street you can aim at protesters." - Most caught the ricochets. - What do you mean, "most"? We put 61,000 soldiers, 1800 tanks, and 1750 APCs on the streets. Someone had to die, didn't they? The whole army against 3,000 workers? What were they armed with, trowels'? No, most were from the shipyard. Orders are in from Moscow - you've been promoted to lieutenant colonel. Congratulations. - Did you shoot, Marian? - Ask me once again. Did you shoot? I did. We all did. We cried. Man, how we cried. But we shot. We had no choice. Let's drink. What else do we have left? Drink like Soviets and behave like Soviets. Your dad was in the Home Army, mine was too! Damned reactionaries... Hey, maybe we're not Poles anymore, maybe we're Soviets already? Deep down, we tell ourselves we're Komciuszko, true Polish army officers. But our souls have ugly Soviet faces, not Kocsciuszkzfs. Let's hope the new year is better than the old one. - It won't be unless... - Shh. Let's just wish for it. The boat's really rocking. - Want a drink? - Just what I need now. Feeling seasick? It'll pass. You know Wilhelmshaven. Is there a mailbox, so I can send postcards home? Sure. Hi. You didn't need the magazine. I knew right away it was you. I met a lot of your friends in Vietnam - they all looked like you. That's why I'm not cut out to be a spy. Nice to meet you. Let's go. Please have a seat. May I see some ID? My skipper's license. I didn't take any army documents, too dangerous. I'm Colonel Boone, US Army, this is Captain Nichols, and Sergeant Murphy from the Marine Corps. You wrote that you wanted to talk to us. What about? There's a group of officers in the Polish army whose attitude toward the current political system is reserved, to put it mildly. Justa minute. The US army has sent us here to talk to you alone. If you want to talk to us on behalf of other officers, then the US army is not interested in such contacts. Do you understand? Major! How does counter-intelligence rate our boss's mood? Counter-intelligence doesn't target the National Defense Minister. I wasjoking. Counter-intelligencejokes stop at the rank of lieutenant colonel. Which classified documents did you have access to? Top secret, comrade general. I just spoke to counter-intelligence about you, specifically with Major Putek. A very difficult situation... Colonel Rakowiecki can't manage this presentation. I don't understand. You'll prepare it for our Soviet comrades. As of today, you have access to all "Top SecretlRestricted" files. Yes, comrade. Give me what you have there and you can go. Why's this all crumpled? Don't you have a briefcase? Comrade colonel, we have to investigate Colonel Kuklifiski. What the fuck for? He was in Vietnam and because of the Cerepat case we're looking at everyone who served there. What's more, Kuklifiski sails to West Germany and refuses to let me go. And a minute ago he gained practically unlimited access to all materials... OK, If we have to. But hold off now. I'll ask Comrade General Kufel. Maybe he'll send you on a cruise. Comrade colonel, I don't trust that Kuklifiski... He's the old man's favourite. He writes all his speeches. Whereas you, Putek, are no KING'S favourite. - I'm Daniel. - Ryszard. Finally... This is for you. Six years ago Kulikov planned a spoiler attack in East Germany. Here's the exact map. Now you have two choices: build up your conventional forces to 120 divisions, or create a quick-reaction tactical force of 6 or 7 divisions, and completely rework your mobilization procedure so it takes 48 hours, nottwo weeks. - It's all written here. - All right. You wrote this? I can't use a typewriter - in Poland, they're all catalogued, like fingerprints in the USA, so I have to write by hand. - Smoke? - With pleasure. Keep it. Inside is a camera. So you can take photos of documents rather than rewriting them. - Never remove originals. Never. - Correct... I mean, you're right. If our experts understand, we'll have to change our defense policy. That's a very big deal. I'll bring you an even bigger deal next time. Heard of the "Albatrosses"? Me? Certainly not... The Soviets are building nuclear shelters in three locations in Eastern Europe for their top brass: near Moscow, somewhere in Bulgaria, and in Poland. I have access to the Polish plans. I'll tell you everything at our next meeting. Ryszard, we're going to meet only when it's absolutely necessary. They're building shelters because they're preparing for nuclear war. - I understand... - Something wrong? No, but on my way here I thought I'd finally have - someone I could talk to honestly. - You can't talk to anyone, not your mother, wife, sons. You'll live with this yourself. That's just what I'm doing. "Correct". If we meet again, could you please come in civilian clothes? How did you feel betraying the Polish army's most guarded secrets? I never betrayed any secrets of the Polish army. Everything I gave the Americans concerned only Soviet and Warsaw Pact armed forces. Yes, but they struck at Poland's national defense, didn't they? Nothing could've struck Poland's national defense harder than a NATO nuclear attack provoked by a secret Soviet military doctrine. But your colleagues? Brothers in arms? You betrayed them. I never betrayed my colleagues, only a foreign superpower that treated them and the entire Polish army as drafted vassals, submissive and brainless... cowardly and incapable of resisting. What's worse, the Soviets were right in large measure. I met lvanov at the meeting of general staffs in Budapest. Know who I mean? - They say he's from the KGB. - So I've heard. We had some drinks and I asked him if it's true that they burned Penkovsky alive in a steel mill furnace. He reacted as if I'd hit him in the face. "The Americans don't surprise me, but when a Polish officer spreads such bullshit, it reflects very badly on our commanders." "Did you burn him or not?" lask. "We're not talking about the Polish army. I shot at workers in the streets, so you can tell me, Red Army comrade." He got offended, stood up, and walked out. Screw him. - Here's to Strzemifiski! - We've already drunk to him. To Kobro, then. Walczak, got yourself a bit of an education, huh? More than a bit... Justa minute. Good evening, I'm a friend of... Please go outside. Bogdan will be right down and walk you to a taxi. No need to - I live nearby. - Good night. - Good night. Come here! - Have you been drinking? - What's the difference? I can't drive your car because you won't let me. I spent a year in Vietnam to earn money for it. WhatH/e you earned? I'm still studying, so I don't have a job. - Applied to the Military Academy yet? - I told you I won't be a lifer. I'm a Polish officer like my father, so show this uniform more respect. You may be an officer, but is this army still Polish? And you left respect for the uniform on the streets of Gdafisk in 1970. That's how you earn money for your cars. "THE ALBATROSS" What are you doing? "Top SecretlRestricted". Want a smoke? I don't smoke that scented crap. When's the report on Kulikov's visit going to be ready? It'll be ready when it's ready, right? General Kulikov's head of security asked me to give you this. The dog can sense something. She senses thatyou're ten times farther away from lza. Why did you sell the apartment? I could've stayed there. Don't spoil this day for me, son. - Well? - It's beautiful. Don't be such a bitch, Zuza. Let's go, girl... Come on, it's simple. Look! Come on. See'? Zuza... - Greetings, colonel. - What? Hello. - Major Dariusz Ostaszewski. - Colonel Ryszard Kuklifiski. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. I was afraid Walczak would sell to a civvy. We're all military here. We'll be neighbors. No matter how I figure it, there's no way he could afford a villa. It's a row house. He sold his flat. He must have brought money from Vietnam, too. Sure, he even declared it. But he bought a car with it, an Opel Rekord. They paid well in Vietnam. I bet he didn't declare all of it. It doesn't prove anything. Sure they did, but not that well. Unless he got money from elsewhere. Elsewhere? America. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, general! - Hello. We got your signal. Good to see you again. How are you? - Fine, thanks. You? - Good. But we do have to change the way we communicate. I've written to you about it, twice. Counter-intelligence almost caught me scrawling on the wall today. It's a bitjuvenile. I know. I'm sorry. Finding a technical solution has taken time. Did you get the plans for the T72 tank? Yes... A great disappointment. I told you it'sjunk. A Russian friend told me we shouldn't buy it, but Gierek had no choice. Still, Marian Rakowiecki was pushing the Leopard all the way. I thought I'd die laughing. What is it? Nothing. Take care of yourself. You've bought a house... Yes, but there's no money trail for them to follow. - I don't take any from you. - We know that, but they don't. OK, I'll be careful. Anything else? Ryszard... This is yours. Unfortunately, you can't keep it. No non-American has ever gotten this. Until now. PresidentCarterpersonally had to approve this exception. You've no idea what this... Thank you. - Hello, Czesio. - Hello. Sorry, my hands are full. The only place I could find some peace and quiet. You're not the only one who needs quiet. Move it! We need a bigger house, dad. Who the hell is knocking... - What are you doing here? - Ryszard! Sasha! Are you here for long? I'm throwing a housewarming party on Saturday. Returning to Moscow in the morning, then to Budapest with Kulikov. - He sends his regards. - Thank you. Problems in Budapest? No, why? A routine visit. Wherever you go, there are problems: the Tet Offensive, the Prague Spring. People say you are from SMERSH. People needlessly say too much and to the wrong people. In short, the general staff has an idea that in the event of war, the Soviet staff will have direct command over line units of the Warsaw Pact armies. We want to discuss it with all national defense ministers. Including the Polish army? Czech, German, Bulgarian - and Polish, too. Remember, not a word to anyone. The enemy never sleeps. Sure. I wouldn't want to end up in a steel mill furnace. If need be, I trust you'll arrange a firing squad for me. Ryszard, you are above suspicion. If we didn't trust people like you, men of honour, then who could we trust? Those careeristlice, drunkards and parasites? Those who steal army property and betray their country? They make up the bulk of our armies, losers who hide from the light in the army like rats in tunnels. What did the Poles use to say? "God, Honour, Fatherland". S“ down. ls the KGB on the alert? All quiet since Penkovsky. Cerepat in Warsaw, but losses were small. There's a leak at the highest staff level... A leak in the Warsaw Pact! A spy? Or a fool. If it's a fool, eliminate him. If it's a spy, arrest him. Hi! Straightfrom work and didn't have time to change, but I made it to the luxury store. Put it on ice? - Hania, you have a very nice home. - Thank you very much. - I'll get you a glass. - Thanks. Where's Bogdan?! - Citizen Ryszard Kuklifiski? - Yes, that's me. Already? We're just starting to have fun. Friend, excuse me. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm a Polish army officer. You should be accompanied by military policemen, and the patrol commander should be the rank of major or higher. - Do you have your ID? - Yes, I do... What's going on here? Citizen major, we have a few questions for citizen Kuklifiski. Well, fuck, ask them then and stop harassing people at home. Can't this wait till morning? Citizen Kuklifiski, do you own an Opel Rekord, tag number WAA 3804? - Yes, I do. - ls Bogdan Kuklifiski your son? Did he have an accident? No, he caused one, most likely driving under the influence. - I'll drive you. - No... I've got a car and I haven't been drinking. You have. Citizen duty officer, Bogdan Kuklifiski. Take the cuffs off. Does ithurt? A few loose teeth... Never risk anyone's life again! Understand'? If you want to kill yourself with vodka, go ahead, butdodtdrive when you're drunk! Never! - I didn't drink! - Don't answer me back! - I didn't. I shot up kompot! - What? Kompot! What don't you understand? Kompot! What's kompot? A drug made from poppies, Polish heroin. Go ahead and hit me! Got a gun? Shoot me! You can do that. You know how to do that! - You have no idea what I can do. - Likewise. You know nothing about me. You don't care about us, not me, notwaldek, not even mum! All that counts is working for the commies. You're like their watchdog. Working for a full bowl, an extra sausage, nicer bathroom tiles! You've fucked up your life, so don't preach to me about mine. You have no right... If you can't slap some sense into the punk, we'll be glad to help. How did my son get the injuries to his face? - In the accident. How else? - You! Shut the fuck up! Got all his information? I'm taking my son home. Dad... They locked up lza too. Lather g0. What are you going to do? Don't you care about your brother? A cookbook is more interesting? Any book is more interesting than him. - Waldek! - Getlost! Take it upstairs, then. Move! With inexpressible relief. Aren't you going to take college entrance exams? How many times can I? So maybe not medicine any more but law... Waldek's satisfied. Mum... Get married then. I'm satisfied. - What do you want to do, son? - I'll manage. I bought a motorbike, a genuine Norton. - I'll fix it up and sell it. - Do you know how? Iza's brother has an SHL motorcycle. How about the army? Anything butthat. We're going to do a good job! We've won the first stage, but the second will be much tougher. I know you'll help and that we'll win. What that electrician's doing may damage our relations with the Soviets beyond repair. Gen. Siwicki has ordered us to plan for a state of emergency in Poland, using the army and security forces. But there's no such thing as a "State of Emergency" in Poland. - There isn't? What do we have? - Martial law in the event of war. - Make it martial law then. - Who's the war to be against? The enemy will find you, don't worry. But I see that privately you aren't convinced, are you, colonel? I assure you that my private beliefs do not matter here. Kuklifiski, I like you, and I value you. So if you don't feel right doing this, I'll find someone else... - Like in 1970. - No, 1970 was a botched job, with no plans or preparation. Chaos, panic, amateurish. We must do this like we did in Czechoslovakia in 1968. It was you who planned our intervention with the Soviets. That worked pretty well, didn'tit? I thought that was highly secretinformation. Do you think without top secret data about people I work with I'd be able to command this whole mess? So'? Will you do it? Yes, comrade. Good boy. What time is it? Two-thirty. Why didn't you go to bed? Iza and her parents waited for you till eleven. I'm sorry, I completely forgot. You aren'tdrunk... - Have you got a lover? - What? I'm asking if you have a lover. I'm asking you, the man I've lived with for 25 years, if you have a lover! Tell me straight to my face! It'll be better than what you're doing. What am I doing? Fucking hell! You don't respect me even that much! I'm asking how long you've had a lover! I was at work... Don't lie to my face, you can't do it! Don't you dare lie to me! Where were you instead of being home with your son?! Is itserious'? Do you want to live with her, have children with her? Or is she just one of your secretaries, a ZO-something doll for one night? Hania, I was at work. We've got a lot... So you don't love me. That I can live with. But I will never forgive you for not respecting me! Welcome, clear friends from our allied army. Let's go. Amman'.! To work! There's not much time. You've legalized through the courts a subversive group named "Solidarity", haven't you? Are you going to do something aboutit? Because I can't see any such plans. And if you don't, I have at my disposal 15 Soviet armored divisions, two Czech, and one German that will restore order here. I'll stifle your counter-revolution before it cuts your heads off. Just make sure, comrade general, thatyou dodtinterfere with my doing so in your backyard. Thank you for your concern, comrade marshal. We'll consider it, confer with party officials, and let you know. Thank you. Sasha, how nice to see you. The marshal wants to talk to you before he leaves. Fools, fools, damn Polish fools. Do you think Solidarity will close the gulag? We'll end up there! All of us. You are the brightest planner here, comrade colonel. - You exaggerate, comrade marshal. - Modesty is good, in daughters. In whores it's unbecoming and unnecessary. You planned the Czechoslovakia invasion in 1968, didn't you? Yes, I did, comrade marshal. Listen to me carefully, Kuklifiski. If we start to help you here, the West will never accept another Afghanistan here in Poland. Not now, comrade general. There will be war, and no one will beat us if we stick together. Understand, Kuklifiski? War changes everything. That's what your bourgeois minister Beck said. "War it is! Everyday matters fade into the background." Understand'? What I'm telling you is top secret. Only a few people in Moscow know. Yes, comrade! You'll get the plan I worked up myself and you'll coordinate the actions of your army with our second-strike forces. We already did it once as part of operation "Shield 68". KULIKOV IS PLANNING... FOR 18 ARMIES TO BE READY ON DECEMBER 8,1980. No, Marshal Kulikov is not playing any sort of game. The party rules here, not Marshal Kulikov. The army only implements government and party decisions. I wish you a good night too. Comrade Marshal Kulikov, were you planning an invasion of Europe? May I sit down? Were you or not? Sitdown. No. Are there plans for invading Europe? What do you mean, comrade general secretary? If your plan is based on the assumption that intervention in Poland will turn into a third world war, then your plans have misfired. The Americans have seen through them. They sent a note to Indira Gandhi, who accepted it with understanding. That's almost a billion people. No war and no intervention! Do I make myself clear, comrade marshal? - It's not so simple... - It is that simple. There will be no war and no intervention. Such is the will of the Communist Party of the USSR. You are free to go, Comrade Kulikov. For now. What's wrong, comrade marshal? Send a doctor to my office for Marshal Kulikov immediately. Ivanov. Ivanov! There's a spy in Poland! There's a spy working right under your nose, lvanov, making a fool out of you, which is no big deal because you are a fool, buthe's making a fool out of me! And for that heads will roll. Yes, comrade marshal. One more leak out of Poland and rest assured what happens to you will not be pleasant. Find the son of a bitch now! - Ryszard, what's wrong? - Got it? Yes. - Justone? - It's more than enough. - How does it work? - You bite it and swallow. You pass out in eight seconds. They say it's completely painless. - Are you sure you want it? - Yes. Thank you. We can evacuate you immediately. But this is my home... Don't do anything rash. Even if you can't see a way out, we'll find it. Ipromise you, I'll find it. If something happens, I won't abandon you. Go now. - Colonel Ryszard Kuklifiski? - That's right. - Do you have a safe, colonel? - Yes. Why? Delivery from the Ministry of Internal Affairs - top secret. Keep the documents in the safe and do not show them to anyone. Do not remove them from this room, copy them, or make any notes. By order of the Minister of Internal Affairs. Please sign. OPERATION "SPRING" The Military Council of National Salvation... ...arrest and intern 5897... Solidarity activists and so-called "dissident groups". - Leaving early today? - Yeah, so long. - Have the shops gotten deliveries? - No, but this morning in the city... - Are you hurt? - No, but I feel dizzy. - Careful! Can you stand? - Yes, I have to get home... Home? Your nose is broken. - Go to the clinic, we'll join you. - That was some fucking smack! You might have a concussion. - My papers... - Forgetthem. - Do you feel sick? - Give me a hand. - My papers, I have to... - All right, all right. - Does he have a concussion? - Probably not, but the colonel should go to the hospital for observation. I have to go home... I have work to do... Sit still or your nose will be crooked. Fine, we know it's a tough time, a crisis, but you're working so hard you're walking into walls. Whathappened? Did someone attack you? Yeah, Solidarity. Thank God. I thought you'd lost your mind. Here are your papers. I made sure I got them all. What's going on? The Soviets are evacuating their civilian personnel. Make sure this gets to the Pope in Rome. S“ down. - Eightpeople? - Yes, comrade marshal. - All from Poland? - Yes, comrade. - My Roman source reports... - Stop! You've got a spy in the Pope's closest circle? My Roman source reports that the CIA has the plans for martial law, including Operation "Spring", which Gen. Siwicki presented at the meeting of the Polish National Defense Committee. That's about thirty people. Yes, but the text the CIA sent to the Vatican does not include the handwritten corrections Gen. Siwicki made just before his presentation to the committee. The CIA's text is an early version, which only eight people had. - When are you going to Poland? - The plane is waiting. We have a traitor in the general staff! Afucking spy working for the Americans! - Where's the suspicion from? - It's no suspicion. It's information from the "Roman source", sent to us by our comrades in Soviet counter-intelligence. Is that clear? I'm putting myself at the disposal of the Minister of National Defense and the prosecutor. This is my fault. We'll decide who to blame later. Right now we have to find the son of a bitch and hang him by his balls. Genclera, you'll get all the help you need from all of us. You and Putek drop everything else and work only on this now! Yes, comrade! Who's on the list of suspects? It's not a list of suspects, just possible solutions. We, Rakowiecki, and that cryptographer... What's his name? - Lieutenant Brzézka. - That's right! Brzézka. I'm putting myself at the disposal of the military prosecutor. Me too. We're all in this together, of course. Then... in that case, gentlemen, I don't think that'll be necessary... It's me... It is fucking necessary! I talked to the old man, and he's putting himself at the disposal of the prosecutor, too. You've misunderstood me... - Actually, the person is... - You've got something on your face. The truth is the Soviets don't know shit, while we can conduct our own investigation more effectively because we all know each other better. That's it, enough said. For now keep your mouths shut. Remember, martial law on the 13th, and I want the bastard's head by then. I'm going to see the general. THEY KNOW. I NEED EVACUATION IMMEDIATELY. TOGETHER WITH MY FAMILY. JACK STRONG For fuck's sake... IMMEDIATE EVACUATION BUT ONLY WITH FAMILY. JACK STRONG CONFIRM RECEIPT OF MESSAGE. IMMEDIATE EVACUATION. ONLY WITH FAMILY. JACK STRONG Fuck... - Bogdan, wake up, son. - I'm not asleep. - Son... - What is it, dad? I need your help. I'll take the washing machine to the workshop tomorrow! I've already borrowed a handcart from Ostaszewski. This time it's serious, son. Getup. - Are you going to tell us? - I can't. You don't have a lover, do you? - I'm sorry. - It's all my fault anyway. - Did Bogdan go far? - Koszykowa Street. He could've been there and back twice by now. - Ever seen dad like this? - In December 1970. Stay... - What are you going to do? - What I need to. - Jesus Christ, Ryszard... - Dad... This? You were just meant to check if the repairmen were still there. Don't you understand anything? Why did you go in there?! Don't you understand a thing?! You could've ruined your whole life!!! Why? To save yours... At least I tried. I'm sorry. - Ryszard... - Quiet! Stay here. Ryszard! Sorry to come so early. Pvejustlanded and no KING'S working yet. What are you doing in Warsaw? Consultations with your counter-intelligence. Gandera, is it? Gendera. You know we have a spy in Warsaw? Gendera's picked a few names, and I've come to talk about them. He's getting his revenge on me, but I don't know why. Gendera's our man, it's Putek who's named you. Putek? You didn't want to take him sailing to the West. The son of a bitch. Don't worry. We went through worse in Saigon, didn't we? I'll take care of Putek. We'll send him to a post in Egypt. Listen, Ryszard... What about that Rakowiecki? Marian? Not him! He fired at workers in Gdafisk in 1970. Ah, I see. Then you're wracked with endless guilt. - I can't leave, dad. I've got lza. - Then stay! No one can stay. At my signal you mustleave the house, each of you separately, no rushing, just act normally. It has to look like a regular weekday. - Like everything you do is on purpose. - What purpose could I have? Take the washing machine to the repair shop. - What do I do with it afterwards? - That's a good idea. Leave it on the street. It's a good idea. - The washing machine? - We leave everything. We can't take or sell anything. We lake only what's in our pockets and in mum's handbag. Clear? Dollars, jewellery... Even Zuza will stay with lza. Our flows'? Bury them somewhere far from the house and garden. Later on you can tell lza where they are. But don't tell her anything now. Say we're leaving the dog for the weekend. Hear me? Now the most important thing. On my signal, you must all be at the MDM Square, by the lamppost. At 11 o'clock sharp. Not a minute later. Son, this time you'll have to memorize everything. Jesus... They'll kill us. Yes, it's possible they will. They'll kill us if... If we stay, they won't. They'll kill only me. - I'm sorry. OK, we stay. - No! We're all going. We've been talking too long. Come on. At 8:21 a Seat 850, tag number WIG5536, pulls up at no. 11. Mrs. Kuklifiski leaves the house, gets in the car and they drive off. Got it. What's going on at the OstaszewskFs? All quiet there. No activity observed. Got it. At 10:01, KuklifiskPs son, Bogdan, leaves, and his girlfriend, lzabella Michalak, joins him. - Gotit. - Check. At 10:05 Colonel Gendera approaches. Don't even joke like that. Oh, fuck! Tidy this place up a bit! - Hello. - Hello, citizen colonel! - Whafve you got? - Routine, citizen colonel. Like every day, everyone's gone to work. The only ones left are the deaf old lady at no. 17 who clears the snow, and Kuklifiskls son, Waldemar, but he usually sleeps late. Hey! Isn't that Putek? Putek's being sent to Egypt. What the fuck are you doing here? Oh, citizen colonel. And you? What are you doing here? You should be in Egypt. I wanted to close the case before I left. I've taken charge of your cases, Putek! If he gets away, you'll take charge of the consequences, too. Your father fought in the Home Army. My father's been dead since 1944 and has nothing to do with this. No one from my family had anything to do with this. I can't agree. The death of your son, no matter how you look at it, was a result of your, shall we say, activities... Yellow Mercedes van. Slubice... Siubice 19:00, East Berlin 21:30.. We're going in. Alert all units! We're going in! Open up! Army counter-intelligence! Open the door or we'll break it down! Open up! Break it down. Go around the house to the back. Counter-intelligence! Come out! Come out! He'll make it. He's slow, but you can depend on him. If we don't move in three minutes, they won't be waiting for us. What do we do? If they've got him, they'll force me to come back, wherever I am. Maybe they won't do anything to him. They'll do everything in order to get me. - Everything? - Everything. Dad, what did you do? I worked for a foreign intelligence service. Get busy, gentlemen. There mustbe something. - Rip up the floors. - We are... The bathroom tiles, then! You never said a word, dad. I'm sorry, dad. Do something! Bogdan, lie down flat. Give me my cap. Stop him! What are you doing? Cuff him! Her too. What are you waiting for? Mum! Dad! There he is! Son! They broke in! They saw me run and they'll be here soon. - Gotanything? - Nothing, citizen colonel. I'm sure he's across the border by now. Stop speculating! There must be something here. Dig up the garden! Citizen colonel! Documents please. Open up the back. - Open the crate. - No can do, buddy. Diplomatic mail. Klaus! - The van isn't registered! - Open it! Just a minute. It's a new van and isn't on the embassy list yet. Call Warsaw and check. Call Warsaw! See what our comrades say about it. No need to. Goetz is on the line with Warsaw. They report a possible illegal attempt to cross the border. Come here! You had these dogs in Auschwitz, didn't you? Kowalik! Yes? Have Putek check these two. They say they work at the US embassy. Next time update your registration. All right, comrade. Forgive me, God... Goodbye. Why...? You came hereto arrest Ostaszewski. In November, Ostaszewski contacted French intelligence. - Who did you think we were after? - Me? Nobody... Kuklifiski. Gentlemen, we must end. - We've tired the colonel enough. - Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, colonel. It was an honour to meet you in person. Colonel, was it worth going through all you have endured? Poland is free and relatively safe. I'm sure we'll be part of NATO soon. The US altered its war doctrine to make it possible. Butmostimportantly, we avoided a world war, and the Soviet Union collapsed. Yes... it was worth it. Are you going to the Academy? My son's been dead a year. Today is the anniversary of his death. Can I take you to the cemetery? No, thanks. My older son is on his way here. - Will you be all right? - Yes. Thank you.
