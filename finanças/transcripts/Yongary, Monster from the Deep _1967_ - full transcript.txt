Mitsuki, don't cry. He's our only son. He's just a boy. Remember, Mitsuki, you haven't lost a son, you've won a daugther. My only daugter, and I hope the boy will be a good husband to her. I'm sure he will. Dry your tears. And when will the lovely Soon-a be married? I don't know, but I'm in no particular hurry, thank you. I hear rumors about you and Il-woo. That would be like falling in love with a computer, almost. Excuse me. I must be going. Oh, must you? We were expecting you for lunch. Another time. Il-woo, I'm afraid I've been rater nasty to you. You couldn't be. I do have a lot of research still to do, tought. Te familiar apology of te dedicated scienthist. But you have to draw te line somewere, you know. Your father was equally dedicated, but he died of overwork. Neverteless, I must go. Excuse me. He's going to be as famous as is father was. Why do scienthists act as tough the only important work in the world is what they're up to? All he ever talks to me about... is is stupid work. And I must say I don't get alf of it. I think he makes it up on is own. But he doesn't know I'm not always impressed by scienthists anyway. I think that boy's going to go crazy, and very soon. Soona, don't be unkind. Il-woo's very talented. One of these days you're going to see Il-woo at te head of his profession. He's a wonderfully gifted lad. Why must you always stand up for him like that? Your father's decided to like Il-woo, just in case - He becomes one of the family later. - Oh, mother. - Shall we go eat? - Yes, let's. Good idea. I wonder why little Ico didn't come? Oh, well, you know how children are. He's forgetful, all right. All boys are. But he wanted to show us that little surprise he had for us. He will. What is it? I don't know. My skin, it's hitching so. Hum? What the... Well, this is one hell of a way to start a honeymoon. - What got into you two? - I don't know. This light started to shine on us and we just started to hitch all over. - You started to hitch? - From over there. - I think I know what's going on. - Well, what? - Come on out. - Who are you talking to? Come out of there, Ico! - Well, I'll be... - Ico, What a surprise. What have you got behind your back, young man? - It's nothing. - Here, give that to me. - What is it? - Just a toy. Hey, you two are going to be late. You'd better hurry. You're right. Let's go. Bye. Monster. Have fun. Come on, Ico. - Where'd you get that, as if I didn't know? - In your lab, as if you didn't know. Didn't your mother ever teach you not to shoplift? Sure, but it was my surprise wedding gift. Well, quite a surprise. Don't you realize they almost scratched temselves to death? Yeah, but you gotta admit it was kinda funny. Yes, Ico, I guess it was. My boy, that ligth ray is experimental. That's What I thougt it was, Il-woo, so I experimented. Now you can put in your notebook that it works perfectly on newlyweds. Thank you, Einstein, but I was serious. You mustn't play around. We've found out that the ligth ray causes severe hitcing. But there can be side effects. Understand? We've been investigating it. I'll bet you never realized you could harm your sister and her new husband. So, from now on, just leave things where you find them, all right? All right. All right. Over there. - There. - Now, come here. Look, you can play with these instead. Hey, those are terrific. I must've dozed. Boy, I'm really tired tonigth. You can sleep afterwards. You're not going to be a nagging wife, now, are you, my dear? I bore you already. Looks like our marriage is doomed. No, that happens wenever I get married. I get tense. You were smiling. And, really, I don't know ow you can be tense and smile all at one time. It's easy at weddings. Especially when marrying the world's loveliest girl. Let's not talk politics now. Now, sweeheart... If that subject doesn't interest you, this might. That's just my father at the control center. I'm sure he thinks he's very funny. - Yes, sir? - This is headquarters, son. Do you need me, sir? That's right, and immediately, I'm afraid. Reconnaissance job, my boy. A rocket is being readied. What is it all about, sir? There seems to be... some kind of nuclear test somewere in te Middle East. We want a monitor on it. We'll need you here within an hour. Very well, sir. Please get someone else, can't you? He's supposed to be here tonight. I'm sorry, dear. It's a pity. He's te only one who can handle it. It'll last two days. We'll get him a two-week vacation when he returns, all right? I guess so. There's apparently no choice. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero l'am now over the target area. Good. fire retro-stabilizers and commence reconnaissance. Would you come here, sir? I can't get trough to te capsule. Something's gone wrong with the radio. Capsule, capsule, come in, capsule. Hello? Come in, please. Control tower, come in, please come in. - Come in, capsule. Capsule... - Oh, please, can't you do anything? We're doing all we can, dear. Capsule, capsule... Here is the latest news bulletin reports from korea's rocket control center indicate that after a perfect takeoff and a flawless entry into orbit, our rocket number 7-x, at present on a routine reconnaissance flight, has developed some radio trouble this, however, is not causing too much worry and the experts are in hopes of clearing it ap momentarily Capsule, capsule, capsule, come in. Come in, please. Capsule, come in. Capsule, come in. What do you think is the matter with him? Where is he? If it's only someting wrong with is radio, don't worry too much. He'll have little difficulty landing the craft. Te only problem will be that we won't know where. He migth even land in the ocean. We'll do all we can. Control tower, do you read me? Over Control tower, come in, please. Reading you loud and clear, capsule. Go ahead, capsule. Capsule, we read you. Where've you been all this time? Listen. I'm so glad he got through. Prepare rocket for landing. Use manual de-orbiting. Position yourself with the rear stabilizers. Time retro-rockets for landing zone two. Roger, re-entry at landing zone two. Very unusual, an earthquake in that area. An earthquake? I thought they were just in Japan. Not true, Ico. In any case, we do have a large earth movement here. Sir, there's someting a bit unusual going on here. Would you take a look, please? Sir, we have triangalated... the epicenter of the earthquake. The epicenter is shifting. It's moving rapidly in a straight line. How? And if we extend this line in the direction of movement, it points directly to the heart of Korea. we have no choice but to call an alert. Get me H-Two. Capsule, come in! This is capsule. Land your craft immediately. Change perspective for zone 10. Oh, look! There! He's coming down. He made it. It's all right. Let's go. A perfect landing. - That's te best one yet, I think. - Yes, it was. We'd better get over there. B Post, B Post, this is 6-M. This is 6-M. The capsule is on te ground. The landing was successful. Welcome. Welcome. - Good landing. - Congratulations. Oh, darling. I'm here, too. I think you were just wonderful. Te eartquake's moving, sir. I thought so. In what direction? - To te norteast. - Well, now what? It looks like everyone is agreed on one important point, gentlemen, and that is that this earthquake, or earth movement, is defying every natural law that man knows. It seems to me you're exaggerating. this is nothing more than a tremor. I don't agree with you. We ave an earth movement. We don't know how it started, and we don't know how to stop it. I hope, gentlemen, you will allow me a word. I admit that my point of view is strictly military. Consequently, I believe in having cards on the table. The moment for teorizing, I think, is over now. We're positive of one thing only. There's an earthquake heading towards the center of our country. That's why we're here. And when this heartquake gets here, it's going to bring disaster. That is, unless we can get ourselves ready for it. Well, there you have it, as clear as day. Now, What are we going to do about it? A clear statement. However, I greatly fear that science cannot help. We're as mystified as everybody. But we cannot just sit and wait. Now, we must start in preparing. At least we have a few hours' time to try to minimize te danger, and the damage that we know are bound to occur soon. We must declare a state of emergency and martial law. I'm sure you're right, General. So we'll begin all preparations and be ready for trouble, but I think it better that we call no alert until we're sure te earthquake will it. - This came trough just now, sir. - Thank you. Gentlemen, the United Nations as just announced that they will help us. An expert team of scientists as been ordered to come to Korea. They sould be here within a few hours. It's Hwangae. According to the board, the heartquake is now hitting close to te Hwangae province. There's no time for speaches. Well, it's beginning to look like you were right, General. I autorize you to impose martial law immediately. This is an emergency announcement. this is an emergency announcement. An earthqaake is imminent in this area. Stop whatever you are doing and return home. Martial law has been declared. Return to your homes at once. I repeat, return to your homes at once. listen to your radio for further instructions. - An earthqake will be hitting this area. - An earthquake. We'd better go. Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency announcement. An earthqaake is expected in this area. Do not panic repeat, do not panic. Mother, I'm so scared. I know. Just don't forget your father. He'll find something. - There. Do you see it? - Another degree. More. Down one, and across... About five. Hurry! Hurry up! What could that thing have been? What does it want? Where'll it it next? It migth stop before it gets any closer. That would be very pleasant, but don't count on it. You know, this earthquake reminds me of someting I heard a long time ago. When I was a child, my grandparents used to tell me fables about a monster. He was connected with earthquakes. - Yongary? - That's te one. Sir, we found this man three miles from the earthquake center. Look, please... - What's that? - It's Yongary. The mysterious moving earthquake... has been identified as being caused by a gigantic reptile this monster, Yongary, has already been responsible for several deaths and great damages all citizens are advised to stay in their homes our armed forces are making all necessary preparations to deal with the monster This is Patrol Six. Come in. You see anything over there? Not yet. At ease, men. - Anything to report? - No, sir. Headquarters. Headquarters. This is Car Two. Do you read me? There's a strange disturbance here at Inwang. I don't understand what's going on. An explosion at high altitude. The mountain is going to blow up! It looks like Yongary wasn't a myth after all. So, General, I suggest you get a few tanks over tere. Yongary's coming out! So, we must now alter all our plans and evacuate. I want to see every single living human out of this town by sun up tomorrow morning. And furthermore, I want several brigades out on te streets. They're going to aid the people. And the rest of the army on tank maneuvers. Good. I think we have three tank divisions available. The monster yongary has been reported in the Inwang area. All citizens are ordered to evacuate the city. Number 13! Battalion, withdraw tanks! Il-woo, where are you going? Il-woo, What are you going to do? I'm going to see that monster. - You can't. - Oh, no. The warning's out. You've got to stay away from there. You know it could be terribly dangerous. Now we've got to get out. - Come on, Il-woo! - No, just a minute. Nobody knows what to do this time. Neither the generals, nor the so-called politicians. If I can help, I've got to see him first. Well, in my opinion, you're just committing suicide. Anyway, you were never a hero before, so what makes you think you have to be one this time? She's right. Please don't go, Il-woo. Don't you worry. I have to go. I'll be all right. I'll go, too. - Ico! - Ico, no, come back! Please! Ico, where do you think you're going? I'll bring them back. You wait here. Ico. Il-woo. Repent! All you sinners, repent! The Lord say's repent! The Lord say's repent! Seek ye repentance and ye sall be saved! Repent, you sinners! - Pass te beer. - This is good. Try some soy sauce. Down the hatch. Haven't you heard? The monster's heading this way. We'd better all run to te hills now! And what are we supposed to do if the monster comes to the hills? Head back to town? - Go get yourself a cab. - I don't want to meet that monster. And I'm sure he won't die of a broken heart if he doesn't get to meet me. Goodbye, everybody. - Why, you miserable... - You know someting, Ito? What this place needs is a couple of waiters who know how to draw beer. Ico! Il-woo! Ico, get back here! Il-woo, Iook! He's pretty big, he? Come back! You could get killed here! Hurry! Ico, get up. - Come on, Soona! - Come on, come on! Please, Il-woo. - Are you all right? - I think so. Where's Ico? - I don't know. - Where as he gone? - What do you think? - We've got to find him. Gentlemen, the reports all agree on one point, the monster's power. Not even tanks, it seems, can make a dent in him. Very well, General. Now, let me ask you What's next, if I may. It's hopeless unless we start with the missiles. Please, General. I've been thinking a lot about those missiles. You know, they migth do more damage than Yongary. And I'm very much afraid of one thing. If those missiles go, they could destroy... one of te truly great landmarks of old Korea. Gentlemen, as far as I am concerned, the time as come when we must discuss Korea's future and forget about Korea's past. If he goes north, he'll hit the Pavilion of the Moon. It seems to me that one ancient landmark is a lot less important than millions of lives. Come in, Tower, this is Helicopter One. We are flying above Yongary this minute. All of his movements are slow at this time. He as turned completely around and appears to be headed back the way he came. All right, let's move. What was it? Why sould a monster drink oil? I've got it. Hum? What's that? Gentlemen, we've been observing Yongary. He just drank a wole storage tank of oil. He just drank What? Mother, please. Uncle Il-woo! It's him, it's Ico. - Hey! - Ico. - Ico, we thougt you were dead. - Ico, where have you been, Ico? Hey, Uncle Il-woo. - Where were you? - Watching Yongary. - Really? - Yes, and how about this? - He eats oil and gasoline. - You mean it? Yes. I was standing near te main valve. I shut it off so that he wouldn't be able to get any more to drink. Boy, was he mad. He started screaming and pawing up te ground. And guess What? There was this one tank there. His tail touced it and it blew up. That's when he changed. He started dancing around, itching and scratching. Why do you think e did that, Uncle Il-woo? - What kind of tank? - I don't know. Wait. There was a terrible smell and lots of ice. What? A smell? And ice, too? Uh-uh. Show me where, Ico. Il-woo, wait a minute. You can't go anywere like that. You're hurt. I'm not just going to sit around. - I'd better go with him. - Soona, please... Ico, no! You have to stay here. - Sorry, Il-woo needs my help. - Oh, no, Ico. Ico... Hello. I'm Professor Il-woo Nami. I've got to get a closer look at Yongary. Will you please let me in? You got here a bit too late, sir. They're going to hit Yongary any minute. They'll be using guided missiles. You'd better go. They're going to it Yongary any minute. They'll be using guided missiles. You'd better go. Missiles? Really? They'll be no use. Well, let's hope they are. Anyway, I have my orders. Then I guess we'd better go to headquarters. I'm sorry. Father? Soona, you know you souldn't... Il-woo, What's wrong with you? It's noting to worry about. I believe you're planning on missiles as a way of attacking te monster. - We have no choice. - I wish you wouldn't. Why? It was Ico, here. His reports on the monster gave me te first clue about it. - Ico? - Boy, you should have seen it. Drank three big tanks of oil. Gentlemen, there's a definite pattern here. He consumes eat energy material. He drinks gasoline and fuel oils. Now, if eat nourises him, exploding missiles will do nothing more than add energy in larger amounts. Tey will not destroy him. All this on a child's story. It is just a little ridiculous, you'll admit. So, we've had our little joke. Now we've got to move. We've drawn plans. We had better prepare all the missiles and set the launching in a short time. - I say ten minutes. - No, please. Those missiles are really going to be dangerous. Why not lure the monster away from te center of town? You've got to get him in another area. I mean, if you must go ahead and fire those missiles... Sounds like a good idea. Can it be done? There's only one problem, tought. How to move te monster away? Use temptation. Well, open the fuel tanks. I mean, the ones at the Namsan depot. You know, I really can't take all this seriously. Now, hold on, wait a minute. this as possibilities. I say we open te depot. If this scheme can save one human life, it's whort it. He's right. - I'll be in touch with you later. - Goodbye, Father. - Goodbye. - Good idea. - Hi, everyone. - Hi. Well, Il-woo, do you need anything? Well, yes, as a matter of fact. A helicopter. I can get you one. Why do you need it? Watch this. When Yongary was at the refinery, he had a bad reaction from a chemical. A chemical? Uh-uh. And if I'm not completely wrong, well, I think we can get him by using it. Well, what's it made of? A precipitate of ammonia. - What? - Ammonia? Uh-uh. All right. Let's get it all open now. Open all fuel vents. I don't believe it's working. - What's wrong, then? Not enough? - Who knows? - Get a helicopter. - Yes, sir. Hello, Six. Right. Get me a helicopter. Right. Here you are, sir. Thank you. To Crew Three. I see te monster won't move. Climb two hundred feet up. You're flying too close. Acknowledge, please. - I wonder where Ico is. - I don't know. Helicopter crew three reporting. The monster seems to be reacting to some stimulas, which we cannot see. He is starting to move, and his horn seems to be turning red. Hey, it's working! The monster is moving toward the refinery. He is now at the refinery. Time for the missiles. Yes, sir. Prepare the missiles. Prepare the missiles. - He seems to have slowed down. - Yes. This could be only temporary. I think the solution, the ammonia, needs more work. The missiles worked, I knew they would. It happened, see? It's wonderful. The monster is no longer a menace to our people. - I knew they'd do the trick. - Yes. Let me see... This migth work. That's it. It's beautiful! Hu? I should have had more faith. this is the answer. I just knew I was on the right track with that ammonia. All we need now is a furter refinement of this precipitate. That'll put him out of business and it's about time. Il-woo, congratulations. I'm sorry. Il-woo, you know, I'm so proud of you. You must be a genius. What's wrong with you? Hey. He's dancing! Go, Yongary, go! Hey, What's that? - Come here. - Hey, leave me alone. What do you think you're doing? Leave me alone, will you? - Get your big mitts off me, will you? - Come on. - Get that kid out of here. - Come on, let me go! - Stop kicking, you little brat! - Control Tower. Control Tower. - It looks like he's still standing. - What? Yongary's not dead? Do you hear me? - He's still alive, sir. - That is correct. That is correct. Area Eight, will you confirm please? Thank you, Area Eight. Over and out. - The missiles. - Yes, sir, immediately. Platoon. Get moving! - It's Yongary! He's alive! - What? Look, look! Yongary! Yongary! Come on! Yongary! Come on, all of you! Hurry! Stop crawling! Come on! Yea! Nothing seems to work. We'd better head back. - It's working, look! - It's working! Il-woo, you were right. How wonderful. He was. - Oh, my! - You see? Stop, please. No, don't do it anymore. What is it? Does he have to be killed? Does he really? Please, Uncle Il-woo. I mean, you should have seen him last nigth. He was dancing. Uncle Il-woo, we just couldn't have let him stay alive like he was, could we? Ico, I know how you feel and I'm sure we all do. Anyway, we have no choice about this. Il-woo, in a way, you know, I'm sorry, too. I wonder if he really meant to hurt us. Well, who's to say? You know, we'd better be going. Yes. We're finished here now. this is one time I don't mind going on record. Hey, look. Sir, do you have a statement for the press? After all, it was your office that was responsible for defeating Yongary. Well, no, I wouldn't say that. I really think the first credit goes to Dr. Il-woo. It was his analysis that gave us the key we needed. There he is. You'd better talk to him. Sir, a moment please. Do you have a statement for the press, sir? We'd Iike to know how you did it. How did you find te monster's weakness? First of all, I'd Iike to thank the Minister very much. For the rest of it, I'm gratified that science was able to be of help, but truthfully, that's only part. Te very first clue was found by Ico, here. I didn't do anything. Ico, Ico, tell me how old you are? About eigth. Well, acting as scientific advisor to a whole nation is quite a job for an eight-year-old. without your work, we migth all ave been destroyed. How do you feel about that? Well, then, perhaps a word from your sister. Miss? I'm no good at words. Your brother's pretty special, isn't he, Miss? Only special about getting himself in trouble. Apart from that I'd say he's just an ordinary brat of a brother. I think little brothers are supposed to act like brats, but, anyway, my sister's nice. What would you like to be wen you grow up, Ico? I want to be a great scientist, a biologist. What would you like most in the world? What wishes? Let's see. Well, one wish is about my sister and Uncle Il-woo. I wish that the two of them would hurry up and get married. Tey're just standing around doing nothing. You miserable brat. - Anything else, Ico? - Yes, someting about Yongary. I saw him play and dance. I think all of you should realize it wasn't is fault. You call im a monster just because of the things he did. He was just looking for food and we had to kill him because he got in our way. He migth have destroyed te entire Earth if we hadn't stopped him. Of course I know. I know that we had to kill him, honest. But my other wish would be that he could be here now. You're a fine young man. We're all very proud of you. Hey, let's get started, can we? Well, now, then, about tat first wish of Ico's... I must say we've been waiting for this. Il-woo, What a wonderful idea. - I think you should. - Do you? And What about Soona? That sounds like a proposal. You should take it. Stop that. I'd hate to disappoint Ico in all his wishes. All right, I accept, in front of witnesses, too. Hey, Soona, just think. In a month or two, you may ave a little brat like me. A month? Oh, you. A lot of corrections: Kilo
