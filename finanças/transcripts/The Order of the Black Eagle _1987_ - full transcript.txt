"World criminal Hitler dead as Berlin falls" The demagogue on his way to power and in world infamy as history's arch war criminal Hitler, at the head of the Nazi gangsters became a dictator of Germany Next to him there is Rahm, one of his earliest companions Whom Hitler slaughtered in a massacre of malcontent followers He climaxed his career of blood by plunging the world into history's greatest war Millions died due to the megalomania of the Nazi Fuhrer Seen here at the height of his arrogance with Franz von Papen who paved his way to power With Mussolini and Gering The tyrant group whose end was to be one of ignominy's doom In the Nazi downfall Mussolini has been executed by patriots of his own country And Hitler has come to an end appropriate to a war-maker That the atrocities of whose Nazi regime have shocked the world "They said it could not Happen again" "Geneva, Switzerland" "Today" And so, there will be scientists Such as out honorable Dr. George Brinkman Jr. who will bring about peace in the world Thank you very much, Dr. Stevens Now, I would like to present the winner for the international Science award In the field of lasers for which he's been recognized and acclaimed here today It is my privilege to introduce Dr. George Brinkman Jr. No No Help me! "Washington D.C." Are those not, beautiful? Those infidels at the museum dared to think that they can keep them from me If anything should happen to my treasure I will cut out your tongues Start the engine, Boon! Start the engine! Let's go Boon. "The Order of the Black Eagle" Starring IAN HUNTER Introducing ANNA RAFANIA as "Maxi" Special Appearance by FLO HYMAN as "Spike" Featuring "Boone" the Baboon We wanted a party we hoped we would have it Saturday afternoon - Look! - What is that? You can't park that here! - Is that a Baboon? - I thought it was Liverworth's kid. Boy he's ugly! Duncan! I believe this is what you've been waiting for. The Smithsonian should be quite relieved to have it back. Be here tomorrow morning ten o'clock sharp! Watch out! Good morning Mr. Jacks Let's take a walk, shall we? I suppose you heard about the kidnapping and the murder in Geneva yesterday Yes, Dr. George Brinkman The world's leading expert in laser technology, I believe. Quite so, but I think it's far more serious than it sounds in the surface What do you know about "The Order of the Black Eagle" Only what's been publicised. A group of neo-Nazi radicals who aim to rule the world with the "supreme white race" Sounding fury signifying nothing from what I gather. Don't underestimate them We kept a close eye on them for a number of years What started as a small band of fanatics has grown enormously What is all this have to do with the Brinkman kidnapping? We have every reason to believe the "Order The Black Eagle" is responsible For what purpose? The Order is led by a Baron Ernst von Tapish Von Tapish was a leader Hitler Youth Movement He patterns himself after his idol He used his family fortune And moved the headquarters to an ancient temple ruin in the jungles of South America Whatever he's up to, we think it has something to do with the anniversary of Hitler's birthday. - You think Brinkman is integral to their plans? - I'm afraid so, Our intelligence tells us they moved some very high tech equipment to the camp. - Lasers and such - Obviously they need his expertise. We've detained an American leader of the order by the name of Conrad Blaiden Bladen was en route to South America It so happens there is an amazing resemblance between the two of you. Blaiden and his assistant are expected to arrive at the compound in two days. So disguised as this Bladen fella, I am to infiltrate the compound, and rescue Dr. Brinkman, right? And find out what the devil they're up to. - What about Blaiden's assistant? - We got quite lucky there. Interpol has loaned us one of their top agents, Miss Tiffany Youngblood - Highly recommended. - Really? Duncan - I'd like to introduce you to Miss Ti... - We've already crossed paths. Miss Youngblood, I assume? You must be Mr. Duncan Jacks. I've heard quite a lot about you - Good or bad? - All good. So you understand my disappointment. - I'm sure you'll become first friends. - Yes, like oil and water. Well, we are off to a good start Duncan, perhaps you and Miss Youngblade would like, to take a bit of time to get to know each other. Study your assignment. I think I can manage lunch about now Shall I come as I am or should I smear myself with disinfectant? "South America" The memorial service will be held at sunrise to honor the soldiers of the order, who are being held as political prisoners throughout the world. The film "The final solution for Israel", will begin at six-thirty at the club The European members of the Order will assemble at the square at eight p.m. At nine o'clock the North Carolina branch shirts, will stage at the cross building at the flag poll Dr. Kurtz - Is all in readiness for tonight? - As you have ordered Herr Baron. Good. Very Good Think of it Herr [Mr.] Doctor. Tonight, here, for the first time from all around the world the directors of The New Order Will be together in one room All the people of the world will know that we are alive, and strong. Yah, I have formulated some plans, that will be... Plans? You have plans? I will give you one final warning. All plans for the new order must emanate from me And be executed at the time and place of my choosing Is this clear, Herr Doctor? Corpulent pig So, as I said there is an amazing resemblance between you and Bladen - Handsome devil isn't he? - Beauty is in the eye of the beholder All of the information you've been given is in these envelopes, along with your identification papers. You should have no problem passing yourself off as Blaiden and Martha. Any questions? Seems pretty straight forward to me. Saito expects us in the lab so we better get a move on. Your flight leaves in two hours Come along Miss Youngblood Hello Saito What's up boss? Who's the pretty lady? Saito, I'd like you to meet Miss Youngblood, She will be accompanying Duncan on the mission. Pleased to meet you Saito is our weapons expert and resident genius. You think we could dispense with the pleasantries and get down to business? What's new in the toy department? Not toys Duncan, this is a serious stuff. Looks like an ordinary pipe lighter, right? - Well that's one way to stop smoking - Very clever Saito. All right, what else? - Serious little devils, aren't they. - You bet! Looks like a cigarette holder you get from a retail store. But with a little something extra. Ingenious Saito. This might come in handy. It will give you up to six minutes of oxygen. Hope you don't ever have to use it. Well if we both need it I hope it will be ladies first. Do I really have to wear a tie? It's more than a tie It's very strong wire saw. It easily cut through the toughest of steel. Here. For my early retirement? It's a highly sophisticated long range two way radio And finally this. - It is called the "Desert Eagle". - Mind if I try it? But Maxi, it's too late Duncan and Tiffany are on route to the Nazi compound now. Chief, the baron makes Gaddafi look like a pussy cat, He plans to destroy, The world's major communications satellites tomorrow night! We have to move fast to stop it. And I do not think our allies are going to help us. The world is threatened, and they always turn to the United States for leadership. Yeah, just like Libya Chief, you and Seito get here as fast as you can. My team is waiting and they are a wild bunch. - Hurry and have a safe trip. - We will. Thanks chief, Aste la vista "El Gato Grande, South America" Such is life. Take them all I'm out. Call. Well, Cisco, looks like the pot is mine. No, gringo. I think the pot, she is mine. Spike my lovely you must first try, reasoning with people. Well, you can't buy your way into heaven. Hell don't cost this much No wonder he needed a gun. First operation of the proton beam is scheduled for tonight. Exact time to be announced. Credentials please. I'm Conrad Blaiden. This is my assistant, Martha Heldman. From Chicago, Oh yes, I attended the rally in 1981 Tremendous turnout. Don't you think? Tremendous turnout, yes. But I'm afraid you're mistaken. The Chicago rally was in 1982. it's quite right Martha. The rally in 1981 took place in Atlanta. Follow me, I'll show you to your quarters. Dinner will be served at eight o'clock. The Baron demands promptness. First partners and now roommates. Well, we'll just have to make the best of a tight situation. Adjoining rooms. No, stop it! So Herr Professor. I'm told you refuse to continue your work on the proton beam, - Then you're surrounded by liars. - You do not refuse? Refuse? How can I refuse? Do not be rude to me, Jew I'm a scientist I'm trained to work for the benefit of mankind, not for its destruction So kill me now and be done with it! Kill you now Herr Professor? Nein. Make you wish to die, perhaps. No, I think you will do as you are told. You will continue your work on the proton beam until you have perfected it. Then perhaps I may be benevolent, and permit you to die. Sorry to bother you Duncan but... I need a friend Sure thing, we're going to have to be inventive. Always a gentleman. Try your masculine skills at this. - Listen, I know that I 've been... - Thoroughly rotten? Look all I'm trying to say... If you're suggesting that we kiss and make up... I think it's an exelent idea. Ladies and gentlemen, Will you please turn your attention, to the video monitor This is just a rehearsal, tomorrow night will be the real thing. It's Dr. Brinkman. Dr. Kurtz, if you please. - The demonstration you're about to see, - Get to the controls. will utilize only one third of the power proton beam. If you will keep your eyes to the right of that star cluster. Standby to fire proton beam. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. What was that? Only an insignificant communication satellite. But for many Americas tonight there will be no HBO. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would follow me to the main chamber, dinner will be served. This way, ladies and gentlemen. This is indeed a glorious occasion Tonight we are gathered to celebrate the birthday of our beloved Fuhrer. Also to selebrate the culmination of 40 years of work and dedication, Work and dedication to the building of a new world, a new order Those of us here, have accepted this great responsibility, and with the help of the proton beam we will succeed! And through great leaders like Colonel Wilhelm Stryker Before you you see the order's new hero A perfect aryan soldier. Colonel Stryker, the declaration! "The Order of the Black Eagle" has signed a declaration of war against the United States of America the Soviet Union, The Republics of China and Japan and all lesser peoples of Israel and Africa Therefore, for blood soil and honor For the future of our children, For our Fuhrer! We commit ourselves to battle! Sieg Heil! [Hail Victory] - Sieg - Hail - Do you believe this? - Nazis love these stuff. The world believes he died in 1945, but our Fuhrer lives in cryogenic sleep. And when we awaken him, through his guidance and with the proton beam We take over, not only the earth but the heavens as well. And the Fuhrer knows that whoever controls space rules the whole world! After tomorrow night it will be "The Order of the Black Eagle". My God, can it be? - To the Fuhrer - To the Fuhrer! To the Fuhrer! I didn't count on being locked in for the night. It seems as though the barron has thought of everything, hasn't he? I've got to get back at the control Brinkman is the only one who can tell us, how close the beam is to being fully operational. You're right but I'm coming with you. - No I do not think that's such a good idea - Why not? Because if I get caught so do you. If you get caught they are going to come after me anyway. Allright. Freeze! - Who are you? - Someone sent to help you Dr. Brinkman. The Aryan Nations council, will hold a prayer meeting in the chapel at 3:30. At 8 PM the white supremacy organization will be... the white supremacy organization... the white supremacy organization... - You disappoint me Fraulein. - Well I'm just crashed. Now you will die. Along with this... will be liberator of the Jew. Colonel Stryker! Herr Blaiden, do you have some explanation for this? Of course, we were simply testing your security system Baron. That's wonderful! The video monitor please. This is a picture of Conrad Blaiden Really, then who am I? Of course you're Duncan Jacks, secret agent, impersonator. And you my dear are Tiffany Youngblade of Interpol Imagine that. Herr Jacks, you are either very stupid or naive, to think that your masquerade would go undetected. Do you think we're fools? Do you really want me to answer that question? - Pig... - Enough of this Kurtz. Take the girl and persuade her, to tell all she knows about their mission here. Lets go! I can have compassion for the young lady. Dr. Kurtz can be cruel man. With your permission Herr Baron I will question Duncan Jacks. I saw how you persuaded him moments ago! No I have new quarters for Herr Jacks. Not quite so nice as previously, But certainly more... permanent. Take him Stryker. After you, Mr. Jacks You are in a reactor cooling tank Herr Jacks. It connects with the river, we will open the gate to flood the tank. - How long can you hold your breath? - Close the cover. Flood the tank! God, he's disappeared! Colonel Stryker, you will bring me Duncan Jacks. Or you will bring me proof of his death. Look! He went up the hill. Wally stay here, Leibowitz, come with me! Wally, look out! There is a cable! - Well if it isn't Dunkan Jacks - Maxi Ryder! What a vision of loveliness you are. Don't get romantic Duncan, I'm here to save your bacon. Sorry Well, we better get moving. The others are waiting for us at the cantina. - Others? - Haven't you heard? We're going to work together. Just like old times - Just how far is this cantina? - About 35 miles. - Pretty nice walk. - Yeah, but we're taking the bus. - "Greyhound" or "Trail ways"? - "El Fredido Express". All right! Right on time. We've got to stop meeting like this Star. Duncan, what the hell are you doing here? - Where's Miss Youngblood? - I've been for a swim. Tiffany, if she's still alive is a guest of the Baron. And she is still in grave danger. Maxi, I trust your mercenaries are prepared for the mission? - Yes, they'll get the job done. - Excellent. There's one more bit of news Star. Adolf Hitler... - He is alive. - What? Cryogenically preserved. Here we are. - This is it? - Yeah! What an interesting oasis. I wonder what adventure awaits us here? Six men, costs 200 to stay. Call. Heya Chikita! I guess he thought he was in a shriners convention. - Salut. - Salut! The sacrifices one makes for God and country. God, what is that, lighter fluid? "Polka", without the worm. Nectar of poets and toreadors. - Ole! - Quite. Gentlemen, meet the fastest gun in the jungle. That would be John Thaddeus Stevens. Cowboy to you too. - We call him "Hammer". - Willy Brown Jr. I believe. My momma don't even call me Willy. - Very impressive. - So much for formalities. - "Special delivery". - S.D. will do. And your field of expertise? - Demolition. - A demonstration is not necessary. And over there is "Bolt". - As in "lightning"? - As in "Bolt". They call me "Juice". For no apparent reason, and this... delicate flower is affectionately known as... "Spike". You know Juice, some day I'm gonna make you a soprano. Star has a fondness of people who come straight to the point. And this is Duncan Jacks. We'll be taking orders from him. - Any questions? - Just one. - Ask. - Who's paying for this? - He is. - And who is he? This is "Star". I'm gonna be taking real good care of you Mr. Star. Thank you. All right now that that's settled, let's pick up the gear. In the Cantina can you hear me? I think maybe you hear me Better now. One of my men tells me you gringos have a lot of much wealth. So why don't you share some of that wealth with us? Better than that, why don't you share it all with us? Now you be good little gringos, And you bring us your dollars, your pesos, and your women. "Don Pepe's Store" Robbers! We're sorry to keep you waiting. Juice! Stay close money bag, it's just too early in the game to lose you. Let's go. You know Manuel, Some days, you just can't make a peso. Come on Hammer, one more time. We're getting behind schedule, Saito is waiting for us at the river. Bolt give us a hand! Cowboy, S.D, get out here! Push! - Duncan, Duncan start a cadence. - All right, on three! One, two, three! One, two, three! One, two, three! The success of this mission grows more dubious by the moment. Don't back up Star, We'll travel by foot to get to the river. Where no doubt we'll encounter a tribe of head hunters... Not again - Come on old man. - No, please stop. - Go on, walk along. - You're hurting me, please. Dr. Brinkman All coordinates have been programmed, but still! The proton beam is not operational, why? I've had no sleep, I can't think straight anymore. Or could it be, you have deliberately sabotaged the machine? I need rest, don't you understand? I need... Brinkman, we're running out of time! Make the final adjustments! And I warn you, you have better be accurate. - Star to "Titanic," are you there? - Come in Star. Duncan, is everything's ok? We've been on the river an hour and it's clear so far. We are 10 miles from the compound. Duncan, Maxi's mercenaries are... unusual, - But they seem very professional. - Excellent. We'll rendezvous with you at 02:00. Enjoy your stroll. Vessel out. - How far up the river is it? - About 9 or 10 miles. Look! Vessel we are pulling alongside, these are restricted waters. Halt your engines. We are not allowing your entry into these waters. Do you hear me? These are restricted waters. Watch out Duncan! You got them! My gun is jammed! All right Duncan! Are you all right? Are you kidding? I haven't had this much fun since Nicaragua. Hurry, hurry Come on, come on! Bring it. Let's go! See if you can find Tiffany. I'm going after the Baron. I think you can also go to work. It's time for the "Desert Fox" to attack. Tiffany! Tiffany Duncan sent me to get you, hurry! We're going to get you out of here. Stand back against the wall. Ok follow me! Come on, come on, lets go! Mr. Jacks! Throw away the gun, please. You stupid fool. You're ruining everything Don't you understand? We are destined to rule! There is nothing you can really change. Sure you caused us some difficulty, yes. Though there is one thing you're forgetting. The proton beam is set to fire in 15 minutes. And you cannot stop it. So you see, Mr. Jacks, you still lose. Since you are going to kill me anyway, Why don't you tell me how to disarm the beam? That's the sporting thing to do don't you think? Well, it doesn't matter. You can't stop it anyway. It takes two fingerprints, simultaneously applied to the electronic identification scope. Obviously one of them is yours Whose is the other? Kurtz? You trust him? I wouldn't. I don't, he'll not live much longer than you Mr. Jacks. There can only be one master, one leader, who can rise like the phoenix, out of ashes. To bring order from confusion, and to rule a white supreme nation! Goodbye, Mr. Jacks. You old dirt bag! Cover me. All right Dr. Kurtz. Deactivate the proton beam. You are too late Herr Jacks. In six minutes the proton beam will fire and the world will be mine, mine! Well then Herr Doctor, let me have your left index finger. How do you know that? You know that, it also requires a Baron imprint, to deactivate this machine. I hold his proxy. Now it's your turn I'm waiting. - Never! - Don't do It! - How do we stop it Doctor? - We can't! We've got to disarm it. There's only one way. Destroy the barrel of the gun. I'll open all the controls and when it fires it will destruct! Nice shooting doc. Spread the explosives, and then get Brinkman out of here! You got it. Come on, come on! The new official flag of the Order now in display, in the main guard tower. Bang on time! Crazy man! Good show, looks like we've done it. - All right, let's go! - I'm with him. You're a hell of a lady Maxi. If you ever decide to return to civilization... Civilization? That's tempting Duncan. But each of us back to our own jungle. Some adventure you got us into here. Well I think it worked out for everyone's satisfaction. Everyone except the members of the order. Who would ever believe this? It's incredible. - What's that? - His personal insignia. Final memento. No, no one ever would believe this. You gave a good account of yourselves. I'm proud of both of you. You lived up to your reputation as well. Well, part of it anyway. Well it's getting a little crowded up here, shall we step out for some air? - Another of Saito's little toys? - Don't let him hear you say that. Do you think he'll have any trouble getting it up? Duncan, what the hell are you doing? Keep it up Duncan! See you later boss, don't forget to write. Goodbye, have a wonderful time. I think Boone is upset with us. Duncan, that is government property! Be in my office tomorrow morning at eight o'clock! Do you hear me Duncan?
