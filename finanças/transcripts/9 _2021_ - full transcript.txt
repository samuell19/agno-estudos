Come on, quick. They're not leaving. We’ll go that way. Christian, please. No comments for now. - How is he doing? - No comments for now. The latest statement-- We have no comments for now. Please! Well done! You did great, man! A statement for the radio? Please! Don’t bust my balls! He’ll talk later. Let’s go, let’s go. - Want me to run you over? - Calm down. - Out of the way. - Go now, now. - How did they know we’d arrive today? - How should I know? Mention the contract. The contract. Well... For a start, they want a public apology to the Colombian. Fair enough. And... a psychological evaluation before signing. What? Well... They need to guarantee it won’t happen again. - Sons of bitches! - No they’re not. They’re right, Oscar. It’s not just the board, the sponsors are worried too. When do we sign? - First the evaluation-- - Don’t you see? - Those bastards. - No, Oscar. - Bastards! - Put yourself in their shoes. He’ll be on the bench for four months. These guys bought a player, and now he can’t play. We ruined their plans, Oscar. They have to watch out for the media, the pressure of public opinion, sponsors. - We’re not pressured? - Yes. But that’s our problem. - Tell them. - That’s what I’m doing. What’s done is done. We have to play it right. If we do, it’ll be fine. It got complicated now? It did. We have to play it right. Come on! God fucking damn it. This was supposed to be ready. Wasn’t it? What’s up, Big Guy? It’s empty. What do you mean ‘tomorrow’? I said we were arriving today. Son of a bitch! So what do we do? Sleep on the floor? What hotel? I’m not going to any hotel. Figure it out, you son of a bitch. No, no. Fuck you Big Guy! Hey champ, what’s up Christian! - What’s up Big Guy? - How are you? Nice to see you, champ. You just show up, you’re crazy. - That mask. - From the paper, you like it? It’s alright. - How are you? - Okay, carrying on. Let’s go guys, let’s go. That’s right. Let’s go! - Oscar, buddy. - Just arriving, Big Guy? I’ve been waiting. Oh, c'mon, I’m here with your son. I’ve worked everything out with these guys. - Did you see the mask? - You clown. Don’t leave everything lying around. - You get to work, Big Guy. - Okay. Okay guys! Don't scratch anything. Go to the kitchen, breakfast is ready. WE ARE ALL CHRISTIAN Hey! Go for a ride. Where should I go? There’s a pool and a barbecue. Go take a look. The idea is a cool, happening look, with lots of warm colors, plenty of grey, and some mixed textiles. - Or... - Christian! Come see this! Hi, how are you? I'm Agustina. - She’s the... - Decorator, yes. I was telling your dad about mixing warm colors. We have this jacquard, we could mix with chenille in a tobacco shade to mix-- - Pardon me a second. - Sure. What’s up, Damian? Did you meet? No, no. Not for less than that. No, they’re playing with you. Look, you’re not understanding me. I'll make it clear. We want 10, free and clean, and 3 per year. Forget the shrink. Don’t bust my balls. They’re fucking with you. If they keep at it, we’ll take the other offer. What do you want me to think? I want to fix this, without selling cheap to these sons of bitches. Good Damian. Get serious, okay? Are you coming over? Okay, we’ll wait for you. Hurry up. - Sorry. - Yes. Where were we? Telling you a bit about warm colors, textiles-- - Listen, Daniela. - Agustina. Agustina, I’ll make it easy. Red is our lucky color. Go with red, and we’ll be set. - Red? - Red. - Okay, I’ll find a color reference. - You’re not getting it. We have to solve this now. Get it? Quickly! Perfect, I’ll have it tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. Good. Listen, can you stay a bit longer now? Yes, sure. Let’s use her, make our apology look nice. Good. Okay. All set? One more time. Hello everyone. I wanted to apologize here for the situation in the Colombia match, apologize to Uruguay’s fans, and the people in Colombia. I know my attitude wasn’t right. I was wrong, and it won’t happen again. Thanks to everyone. - Perfect, that will do. - Cut, cut. This isn't good, things aren't good. I don't know what you guys think. We lost our top scorer. It's worse than that, much worse. Don't make me talk about it. Say it Pablo. I'm not going to say it, I'm pissed off. Think about. If Argentina ties with Bolivia-- No, no, don't talk about Bolivia, I don't care about Bolivia. This guy makes a fortune and you know what? This kid doesn't give a damn. He's a bad teammate, he's irresponsible. And you know what pisses me off? We're here upset and and this jackass is laughing at us. You're wrong Pablo, you're all worked up. Let me say it clearly, this kid screwed us. Me, you, everyone, he screwed everyone. He doesn't give a shit about the National Team. I saw kids crying, man-- I know my attitude wasn’t right. I was wrong, and it won’t happen again. Thanks to everyone. COMMENTS MOST RECENT DEAD MAN!!! CLOWN KILLER THIS WILL PASS! CHEER UP! NATIONAL DISAPPOINTMENT, SHAME! The game any good? Terrible. A bunch of dead men on the field. I can’t sleep. You need to rest. We start early tomorrow. I know, but... I’m all over the media. Everyone is talking, talking shit. It’s a mess, Dad. Don’t read any of that. Forget the world. Forget it. Nothing we can do. Forget about it. Everyone will forget in 2, 3 months. Sometimes I think ‘fuck it all’. Yeah, right. Look at that defender, what an angel. Know what I was thinking? We should do something with the guys. I don’t know. A game, a barbecue. Since we’re here, right? What do you think? I'll tell the Big Guy to call them tomorrow. - All set, Gabriel? - All set, Oscar. Christian. Christian! Let’s go train. Go Christian. Intensity. Breathe in, breathe out. Go... Go. That’s it. Air in below, out up high. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Goal. You’ll break the joystick. Goal! Remember our chat, Christian. You must show remorse, okay? You have to convince her that you won’t do it again. They sent her to negotiate down. Keep that in mind. Hello. A pleasure. Dr. Guzman. - Christian? - Yes. Great, we can start. Sorry, you can wait outside. - Ok. - No way! I can’t stay with my son? No. The consultation is individual. - I’m at every meeting, Damian. - Yes, but she’s the professional. Let's do as she says. Okay. - That’s your father? - Yes. - Your mother didn’t come? - No. - Why? - She died when I was little. Oh, sorry. I didn’t know. - Any brothers? - No. Cousins, uncles, any other relatives? No. I don’t know. We lost touch with the family. I see your father is nervous. Yeah, we’re about to close the trade... He gets a bit crazy. I can see that. Are you happy about playing in England? Yes, that was the plan. And that makes you nervous... No... Why? Well, so close to achieving a goal, something might happen... It would be logical to be a bit nervous, stressed. No, I focus on the game. Nothing else. It seems you’re doing some karate as well. On the field I mean... What happened there? I don’t know. You know it's wrong? Yes, I know. Were you very angry? I guess so. It was all so fast. I was agitated and messed up. That’s it. Players are always agitated, but they don’t all do that. Did the other guy provoke you? Say something? No... nothing out of the ordinary. What’s ordinary? He said he'd hit me, that I was scared, called me a pussy. - That made you angry. - Looks like it. First time you heard it? No, plenty of times. You never reacted like this. Never. What makes you mad? People provoking you, kicking you... No. Off the field. Some people. What people? The people that think they know what I think, feel... ...they have no clue. And what do you feel? I don’t know. This parrot is the sponsor’s mascot. We’ll edit it in on the computer. Your part is simple. You’ll head the ball with an actor, that guy in green there. When he passes it, you hold the ball under your arm, look to camera, smile, and say: “Now I play for Sky Blue Credit", with this gesture. - That’s it. Simple. - Okay. Here’s the parrot now. - I’m the parrot. - Hi. - Shall we? - Okay. Let’s go. We’re filming! Ready. Roll sound, roll camera. Sky Blue Credit, shot 1, take 3. Action. Now I play for Sky Blue Credit. Cut. Very good, that was perfect. Let’s check one last thing. Good Christian. Almost there. Go, go, go! Let’s go! No, no. Mind the plants, you idiot. Leave the door open. - How are you? - Welcome. What’s up, Walrus? This is great. - How’s it going? - Great. - Careful. - Thanks for the invite. - Hey you. - What's up? Go ahead, welcome. Hey, hey. Mind the plants. Careful there. Okay, Wilmer, hand me the... - Alright. - Let’s go! - Play for the team. - What? You know what I mean. Let’s have fun, and easy around the kid. - Come on. - Let’s go! - Here you go, Big Guy. - Got it. Let’s go, let’s go. Go ahead. Pass it to me. Bring it down, down. That’s it kid. I’m open, Christian. You all play like dogs, dogs. - Let’s go! - You’re the worst! - Goal. - Great goal! What’s wrong with you, Walrus? My mother could cover him better. - Always me, always. - Shall we play? Okay, let’s go. Shoot! Goal! Good man. Goal, you moustached. You're the guy! - What are you doing? - Don’t just stand there. You’re crossing a line. What happened? - What was that, you wanker? - Just play, faggot. - What did you say? - Coward, faggot! - What? - Don’t touch him! Walrus, what the fuck is wrong with you? Mean son of a bitch. Come here, come here. - Get him out of here. - Wait, Oscar. - Go tackle your mother. - Don't kick me out! I went for the ball. - Take him away. - Don’t do this. - Come, easy. - You can’t send me off. Don’t be like that. - Calm down. - Don’t you see? I understand. - Wilmer! - I’ve got him. Go tackle your mother. - I went for the ball. - I know. Come on, let's play! - Sure. - Of course. Look who’s here. It was obvious. - Wilmer, what’s up? - Hello, how are you? Welcome. - How are you? - Good. Welcome. - Hello. It’s been a while. - Yes, it has. - Come in. How are you? - I’m fine. Look, no photos here, this is a private party. No social media. Let’s have a good time, They’ll be right down. That’s it. Very well. Very nice. Come on in. - Thank you. - Make yourselves at home. No, the modeling agency invited me, invited us... Oscar, how’s it going man? - I wouldn't let you miss this. - Thank you. I went for the ball. I’ll forget it. - Having fun? - Yes. Why don’t you go get a beer? - Yes. - Could you get me one? Yes, yes. Bring one for... Your name? - Luli. - One for Luli. Okay. - This is the bathroom. - Yes. - Where would it be? - I don't know. No, he’s not here. - Are you sure? - Yes. Look at this room, girl. It’s incredible. Did you see this? - A pool. - That’s the lake. - Oh, the closet. - Any clothes inside? Surely. Awesome. Look at this. Here are the jerseys, everything. - Don’t touch that, it’s too much. - Calm down. Any Uruguay jerseys? Well, I’m taking something. Not a shirt, that’d be too much. You calm down. - We need one like this. - Any day now. You watch out. I’ll take underwear. - No. - Yes. It’ll be fine. Hide it. Let’s close up. Easy now. Hey, you, get up. Come on, time to go. Let’s go. Come on, time to leave. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Hey, let’s go. Come on, time to leave. Hey. Time to go. Get up. So, Christian. You’re fine, better than ever, motivated, ready to come back. You made a mistake. But who hasn’t? That helps us learn, improve, carry on, be better, and not make the same mistake. The interview isn’t about Colombia. It’s about England. We agreed to one question about the incident and then the future, England. - One question. - Okay. So Christian, you have to say the Premier League is your dream. That you feel you’re ready for it. Although Portugal was fantastic, you’re very grateful. The club was very kind to you. You love Lisbon, the people, everything, but now it’s time for England. Let’s go. Guys. How are you buddy? Very well. Are you all there? Christian? Here we are. How are you, Jorge? - Hello. - Great to chat, Christian. You’re a legend, and thanks Oscar for this interview. It's a rough time, so thanks for choosing us. From me, the program, and the whole team, thank you. Okay. Hope you’ll be easy on us. Don’t worry. You don’t need to worry. - Ready to start. - Thanks, Claudia. - Ok. Shall we? - Whenever you say. All set, Jorge. We have the pleasure of chatting with Christian Arias, Uruguay’s rising star, making the news, I dare say, globally. Hello Christian, welcome. We’re live. How are you? Stop, Jorge, can we cut? There’s been a mistake. - What is it? - Are we live? - Calm down. - We said not live. Wait, we had agreed with the producers to pretend it was recorded live. They’ll play it later. It’s recorded, but we pretend it’s live. Nice to know, idiot. - I told you. - No. - Didn’t I? - No. Calm down, Oscar. It’s like Damian says. Shall we start over? Let’s go. - Claudia? - Whenever you’d like. We have the pleasure of chatting with Christian Arias, Uruguay’s rising star, making the news, I dare say, globally. Hello Christian, welcome. We’re live. How are you? Hello Jorge. How’s it going? Quickly, I have to ask about Colombia. How are you taking the sanctions and repercussions? We’re doing well, we’re very motivated, anxious to get back to playing. But let me first apologize to my teammates, to everyone for the mistake. We learn from our mistakes. When you’re young... Well, I have to move forward, work so this doesn’t happen again. Your plans after the suspension? Staying in Portugal after an incredible season, or jumping to a first-rate global league in England? Well, we’re very excited about playing in the Premier League. I feel it’s time. Although we’re so happy and grateful for the Portuguese experience. We love the city and the club has always been good to us, but... I feel we have enough experience to move on to a league like England’s. Do you think the incident might affect the trade? Did you speak to the English? Stop, stop. Can we cut? What’s wrong, Oscar? We said one question about that mess and then on to the English trade. What’s this? I have to ask Christian what the people want to know. Journalistic Integrity. Journalistic Integrity? What are you doing? Shove it, you son of a bitch. Cocksucker. What? You freak. ‘Journalistic Integrity’ he says. That shameless son of a bitch. It was a short question, it was fine. It was crap, Damian. The Colombian mess is old news. I’m getting very sick of talking about it. Don’t you realize this is a mistake? This idiot you found is the mistake. Ass-kisser. Boot-licker, cock-sucker. Thinks he’s a journalist. Son of a bitch. A son of a bitch with a wide following, who can say whatever, whenever. This can end poorly. Whatever he wants? Tell him: if he talks about us, I’ll kick his ass myself. Go ahead, tell him. Go ahead. Sort it out. Call him. No, no, no, Mom. I’m not going to that crap birthday, full of old people. I don’t want to. You always do that. How is that possible? No, no. The doctor’s report arrived. Go ahead, read it. Recommends starting treatment as soon as possible, as he faces a moment of great pressure. Cannot dismiss signs of anxiety and depression without proper follow-up. That’s 3 millions off. What did you say to the psychologist? It doesn’t even matter. This is to bring down the price. Those sons of bitches! Let's see how this affects the contract. - I’ll send them an email. - No, Damian. We can’t fix this with email. We’ll meet them face-to-face. - Over there? - We have to go to England. God fucking damn it! We going, Damian, or what? Hey, go get them. - Be good, keep at it. - Have a nice trip. Starting position, remember. Always moving. Go. That’s it. There it is. That's good. There it is. I nearly played the Davis Cup, for Uruguay. A while back. Against Ecuador, in Ecuador, but I didn’t make it. They say it’s nice. Have you been? Yes. Lots of history. Altitude too. I nearly went to Argentina to train, but then got married... - Hello Belen. - Hello. Hi. I have to keep working. Sure. - Do you mind if...? - No, go ahead. You’re a legend. Practice your drive. - Use the machine, if you want. - Okay. I’ll beat you again next time. Let’s go! You look tired. How are you? Good? Shall we warm up? Okay. Gentle, okay? Good. Very good. - Hello. - Hello. The instructor? He’s didn't come. No? That sucks. Well, I’m leaving. Want to play? Well, okay. - Since we’re here. - Right. How about you? Have you lived here long? I was born here. And? So... Do you like it? A bit boring, isn’t it? Yeah. All the same... At least you play tennis. Yeah. Don’t you like it? Yeah, it’s good to keep busy. Don’t you do anything else? - Like? - I don’t know. - Are you studying or something? - No. Okay. Neither am I. Well, this is my stop. - You live here? - Yeah. - I live around the corner. - Oh, you missed your stop. Yeah, well, I don’t have much else to do. Okay. Bye. - See you. - Later. - Belen, right? - Yes. - Bye. - See you. Go... And back... Go... And back... To the side, that’s it. Go once more... Back. More energy, Chris, that’s it! Go... And back... Go... And back... Once more. Repeat. Go... And back... Go... And back... Come on, Chris, more energy! That’s it... Go. What’s wrong, Chris? Lazy day. Hi. Hi. - Everything alright? - Fine. Any more settled? Yes. Honestly, it’s very peaceful. Too peaceful. Yeah. Told you so. True. But not everything is so boring. - What are you doing? - Listening to music. Cool. Want to listen? Yeah. Weird stuff. Don’t like it? I do. You’re overweight, Christian. We’ll have to monitor that. But I can’t borrow the car unless I go back to university. - So go back and sort it out. - No. - So you don’t like it? - It’s not that. I want to do other stuff. But you can’t always do whatever you want. Why’s that? If you don’t do what you want now, then when? How should I know? Come here. - What? - Come here. - Where are you going? - Wait. - Wow, a pool. - Not that. It’s open. What? They always leave something. -Shall we finish it? No, not me. - Come on. - I don’t drink. - You don’t? - No. Isn’t it boring? - The water is incredible. - Is it? Shall we jump in? I don’t have a swimsuit. - Perfect. - Beautiful. Sorry. I'm just swimming. You leaving? I’m going for beer. - No, come back in. - No, it’s too warm. Come on. No, another drink. I could go for another. - Come on. - Get out. You have to drive me. - No, I can’t. - Why? - Seriously, I can’t leave. - Why is that? It’ll turn into a mess. I can’t. - A mess? Come on. - Seriously. If I could borrow the car, I’d go. I’m asking for a favor. - Hurry back, okay? - Yes. - I mean it. - Calm down. Grandmother, it’s Christian Arias. Come on, Belen. - Footballer? - Yes. That’s nice. Hello. - Come here for the picture. - Go ahead. Christian, can I take a selfie with you? - Sure. - Me too. - Thanks, champ. - You’re a legend. - Thanks. - Thanks, Chris. We’re with you, Chris! Karate Kid. - Get out and take a picture. - I can’t. - Come on. - I can’t park, I’m waiting. Seriously, I can’t buddy. - Come on, get out. - Don’t hit the car. What’s with you? It’s just a picture. - What’s wrong? - What’s it to you? Too much of a star to take a picture? Listen, I can't get off the car. Don’t hit the car. The car, buddy. Forgot about the car? - What? - What’s wrong? - He won’t get out. - So what, moron? Get in, get in. - Come on, Twit. - Chicken. You’re a chicken. Get out of the way. - Get out, asshole. - Psycho. - Who were those guys? - I don’t know, people. That’s insane. I told you it would be a mess. That’s true. But it was fun. Yeah, for you. You don’t get it. - Get what? - Nothing. No, I get it. I understand everything. You’re not some guiding light. You just kick a little ball around. - What? - How dare you... It’s true. Some little ball... What? Put your seatbelt on. You keep gaining weight. None of this, guys. Big Guy, let me explain, you’ll be responsible. Physical training is important, but nutrition and rest are equally important. From now on, you’ll tell me when, what, and how much he eats and rests. Perfect. Each of these columns is a day of the week. Yes. The codes for the right foods are in the rows, along with the measures of supplements. Here are the references. My number is here if you have any doubts. - Call me at once. - I’ll call, for sure. Christian, please, don’t eat or drink anything not on the list. After all this, you have to be fit when you get back. All eyes are on you. Don’t be stupid. - I’m here to help, okay? - Sure. - Want some? - No, no. - How come? - I don’t smoke. - You never tried it? - No. Want to try? Are you okay? Disgusting. - You don’t know how to smoke. - It burns my throat. That’s fine. We don’t have to like the same things. I like weed, you like football. Who said I like football? You don’t? I don't know. It’s what I have to do. That’s all. Not if you don’t want to. It’s not that easy. Why? Oh, look here! Here. This is me. - Looks just like you. - No, not that. Let’s play. Here’s a ball. Can we play ping-pong? Let’s play with tricks. No, stop it. Look, those are like... They’re like animals now that I think of it. - And that one? - Which? He’s cross-eyed. Oh, I’m crying. See those next to the cross-eyed one? They look like... So? Couldn’t fix it. How come? The athletic director is not sure about you. Neither is the coach. I don’t know. They say it’s an investment. There are other candidates. Besides... ...the club owner didn’t like what you did. He doesn’t understand the sport. So... Nobody wants to take a risk. Those English cowards. Their loss. We have more offers. What do you mean? What offers? We have offers. We’ll have to consider them. Listen to me. This is a mess. He’s as fat as a pig. What’s up? - What is he eating? - Listen, Oscar. The kid is down. I tried to do something nice for him. Nice? This is about money. You’re with me or against me. I’ve always been with you. I hear he’s playing tennis. Did you know that, son of a bitch? What if he gets hurt? Who’ll pay for that? - Let him clear his head. - You screwed me. What, why would I do that? You fucked me over, son of a bitch. Son of a bitch, you fucking son of a bitch. Son of a... - Son of a bitch. - Wait, Oscar. No, fuck you. - Can you zip me up? - Going. - Need help? - Yeah. I’ve got it. Raise your head. Look at this... It’s great! - Not those shades. - Why? So they won’t recognize you. Can I tell you something? Don’t laugh, but... ...I don’t care. This was the first time I ever danced. In my life. - What? - Yes, today. Really. And I think I was pretty good at it too. What? Why are you laughing? I was... You moved your hands like this... - It was great. - Beautiful even. No... your friends saw me. You can’t tell anyone. - About your dance moves? - Seriously. Don’t tell a soul. Don’t worry. This is nice. Where the hell were you? I’ll be down in 5. I’m going to go for some time. What? My grandmother is sick. I have to go visit. - What are you saying, Big Guy? - My gran. I have a grandmother, like everyone else. She’s sick, I have to care for her. - Did my dad fire you? - What? I’d fire him. Really. Did he? I’m being serious. Don’t get worked up, I have a life too. When are you going? Early tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah, if my gran can wait. You focus on what you have to do, important stuff. Listen to your father. He knows best. Okay? - I’ll miss you, Big Guy. - Me too. Everything will be fine. Remember what I said. - Hope everything works out. - Thank you. - Thanks, Rosa. - My pleasure. Thank you. Sir? - Thanks, Rosa. - Don't mention it. Thank you. Rosa is good, isn’t she? Hey. He isn’t even facing the ball. He never scores. Hey, Chris, I have good news. We closed a deal, better than England. Where? China. Just for a few months, a year. Make money, wait for things to cool down. Lots of money in Chinese football now. - Are you kidding? - What? We want you to play and make money. This is it. It’s not a bad plan. For fuck’s sake. Don’t be a child now. It’s a good offer. If you hadn’t messed up, maybe we’d be in London. Look at that awful stop, with a brick wall for a chest. Easy to say from the sidelines. He’s horrible, look at that! Shut up, you can’t even play! - I sure did. - Yeah, third division. Third division would have done you good. Sure. You would have learned to behave. - Go in there. - Where? - Down that road. - I can’t. Just go. Seriously, go! - Here? - Yes. Keep going. There’s someone! Dad, what the fuck? - Are you crazy? - You’re crazy. We have the commercial in an hour. You didn’t answer your phone. Go ahead, I’ll catch up. I’m going. - Sorry, but... - What? Nothing, my dad... - I have to go. - What? I have to go. - Oscar, buddy. - How are you? Give me a hug. Legend! Champion! Man, we’re with you. Really, we’re with you. We’re all set. This will be quick. Take pictures and meet the sales team, motivate them. Smile, Chris. Great. More, more. A big smile. - That’s it. - Excellent. Just a bit more. - Good. - That’s great. Keep it up. - That’s it. - Smile, please. That’s it. - A bit more. - Nice. A bit more, a bit. This one is great. This one is in the ranking. Isn’t this one...? That’s it! Look at that one! Look at that smile. This is the one. - It’s good. - Look at that pose. Impressive, very impressive. It’s this one, right? Sure is. That’s it. Who didn’t believe he’d be here? Bravo, champ. How’s it going? - Nice mess, huh? - Hello. Those FIFA cocksuckers are screwing you. But we’ll get them back. - Calm down. - Just talking to Chris here. You’re a legend. Don’t pull. You want to take him home? Who are you? Let us be. You’re a machine. No touching, sucker. Stop, Oscar... Who are you grabbing? What’s your problem? - I’ll rip your head off. - What’s that? Asshole! I didn’t do a thing, he went nuts. Son of a bitch. - Cocksucker. - Just fucking stop it. Oscar, shall we? Let’s get a picture. Come here, champ. Let’s go, a big family portrait. Everyone happy. Smile. - It’s me. - Idiot, you scared me. - You really scared me. - Sorry. - What’s up? - Waiting for the teacher. - I sent you a message. - Did you? I didn’t see it. - All good? - Yes. Want to play a game? Is your dad coming too? I’m afraid he’ll turn up. You’re a little kid. Why is that? You do as your father says. Well, that’s my problem. That’s true. It’s your problem. Good luck. Belen. Belen. Gentlemen, here is Christian. A pleasure, Mr. Arias. I’m the interpreter. This is Mr. Chen, the Chairman. And Mr. Yu, the Athletic Director. The Chairman would like to convey his sincerest admiration and his deep joy for having you on our team next season. Our followers offer all their help and support. He’s glad you’ve turned down other offers and hope you can display all of your talent in China. - Okay. - Yes, yes. Shall we sit? Okay. The parties have read the contract and agreed. We just need to sign it, right? - May we sign? - Yes. There it is. I won’t sign. - Come on. - Let’s go, Christian. I mean it, I won’t sign. Are you joking? No. I won’t sign, Dad. - Pardon us a second. - Of course. Let’s chat outside, this way. They came all the way from China. Why do this now? We had time to talk. Stop. Let’s let him speak. What’s up, buddy? It’s just a year and a lot of money. - But I don’t want to. - We can look for other offers. First a fight, and now he won’t play. Do you want to go back to Portugal? We'll lose a lot of money, but we can go back. Is that it? I’ll call them now. Do it. I just don’t want to play. What? Where do you want to play? I don’t want to play football anymore. What are you saying? - Have you gone mad? - No. You can’t do this to us. I busted my ass to get you here. Think about it. I did, and I don’t want to play anymore. Have you gone mad? Fucking kid! Don’t touch me. - I’ll kill you! - Stop, man.
