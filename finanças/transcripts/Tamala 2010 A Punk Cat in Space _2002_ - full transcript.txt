The rain has been falling in Tokyo for quite a while. Complaints like "Darn it" or "my bones are dragging" or "I can't do any laundry" have become greetings. The unusual series of record breaking rainy days lead to idle talk of it effecting the fruit. The rain pitter pattered away. I guess you could say hope was in short supply. The best is yet to come... Rain clouds concealed the skies above Tokyo. Yeah, everyone was waiting for something. You could see it their eyes. Peering up at an angle... ever so slightly. Closed teeth smirk with lips distorting right or left. The kids' graffiti in the streets and the rain washing away their hauntingly familiar nightmares.

Operation 0100-0234 Complete Time Required 00: 23: 15:32:931 A presentation by Professor Nominos from the Catford Strategy Lab on Planet Q. Antitheology in Capitalism Antitheology in Capitalism Today, I would like to present my... Antitheology in Capitalism alarming findings to the world. Similarities of Catty&Co. And Minerva Similarities of Catty&Co. And Minerva Please recall the meddlesome Catty&Co. Iogo that you see Similarities of Catty&Co. And Minerva in your local shopping mall each day. In your local shopping mall each day. Being persecuted since 100 B.C., the same code word, was passed down in the ancient documents of... the secret Minerva religion of the Feline galaxy. To world historians, economists and theologians who succumb to large capital... I d like to inform you of the embarrassing truth that... has been concealed until today. I d like to express my respect to the Cat Chinese regime's, brave decision in sponsoring this presentation. Please divert your attention to these excavated relics. From 80 to 50 B.C., the same cat eyes mark was found, in all of the Minervan archives. After this, persecuted cult members, who were almost destroyed, revived the mark. It was printed in the postal system on... secret mail for sending messages during... a period of chaos and war. From 1490, a consumer goods company... made use of the cat eyes... trademark along with the brand name CATTY... on in-house manufactured goods. From the mid 1800s as a conglomerate of postal works and household consumer goods manufacturing and sales, the CATTY & COMPANY brand name appears on the world market... and a massive public relations campaign begins. With massive capital and political connections, Catty&Co. Merges with industries in the Feline Galaxy, as well as with neighboring Cat Planets. After repetitive mergers, Catty&Co. Has gotten... where it has today. 1869. A match box series featuring, a cat sold at a famous hotel boutique, in Meguro, Tokyo. A female cat written along with the Catty&Co. Iogo. 1969. The same cat appears in a commercial on a West Coast... network, CatEarth. USA. Suffering from Amnesia? Try DON'T FORGET. From CA TTY & COMPANY. Now in tablet form. The cat eyes mark from the Minerva Catty and product advertising with the cute female cat, appeared from 1869. Who could she be? This female cat who doesn t change. Doesn't she ever die? Is she a product of data? No, wrong. Positively incorrect. This beautifui cat is alive. Always searching... A long, long time has passed, as if I was having a incredibly long dream. A continuous dream of one tiny girl passed... in front of me one afternoon. Following after her trail, all I found was... the dark history of a vast conspiracy. They don t matter to me. Catty or Minerva... Fire! Fire!! I want to see Tamala again. What was she anyway... Good day listeners. Your own Chuck Dopler isn't having a good day. I mean, life is dangerous. Terrorism! It's everywhere. What's happening to our country? Can you see outside the radio booth? The smoke. What's up with that? You folks in Burika are in trouble. Incident at Hate EW3. 16 dead, wounded unknown. Unit 5 and 7, respond now. Tamala / Tatla are coming! The end is near! Cat's Eye Shopping Center Huh, what am i doing? I can't move. My head's a boiling. My head's a pounding. Why's Kentauros shaking? Silly Kentauros. I'm here for you. Hey Kentauros. I know. Let's go on a picnic. If those stupid cats would just shut up... Let s go to the forest. You who. You who. Hi, Michelangelo Nominos? This is the I'M credit card center. We couldn't withdrawal from your bank account. If you borrow money, you must pay it back. It's tough on me too. There's no use. But I'm broke. Of course, I don't hate working but... That's it. I'll look for a job I like. Maybe... write a novel. I'll keep living with my things... in this room with big windows. In this room... What... What was that? She's... What... Tamala? ...The town is up in arms. Everyone has gone mad... A Descent into the Maelstrom Horrible things are happening. You talking to me? Have I lost it? Is this a dream? Could you spare an old man a cup of milk? This Ole World in Minerva's dreams. Ever heard of the Minerva, you whipper snapper? This ancient cursed secret religion infests us even now. Who are you? Is your arm okay? You got a smoke? Marlboro Reds. I hate lights. Repeated destruction and rebirth... the progress of an undying world. Their activity based in a crazed doctrine... devoted to live sacrifice. A crazed cult that couldn't avoid persecution and mass killings. Some believers sought revenge and changed... their identities to fulfiil their pledge. Then, they changed its name. Now, here's the kicker son. They changed the name to Catty&Co. I've heard of it. That new cab company right? A jeans manufacturer? Huh? Where was I now? Oh yes. Making use of underground passageways, built by Catty, they began by cheaply contracting mail delivery, from battle fields of the chaotic Middle Ages. Letters from soldiers to their mothers. Love letters to sweethearts. The crazed believers ran around the battles with joy. They realized something... the power of information. If they could control the vortex of information in, blackmail ransom letters, fiuxuation in exchange rates, you name it, they could rule the planet and get revenge. The entire universe would be Minerva s and Catty s. They processed information faster than anyone. They completely destroyed all rivals and took over. Making money creating and selling volumes of matches, canned goods, films, jeans. Business, business, business. Before you know it, the persecuted end up the rulers. And where is revenge? Turning into nothing but an emotioniess anti-cat. A " destruction and rebirth machine ' The children are the only ones who see this control. I guess you're too old. The ominous robot of Minerva and Catty&Co., hoping to propagate the planet, the Minerva religion created, a robot named Tatla from a deep sea of information. An icon to enhance unrest and chaos. Through telephone lines and fiber optics, controlling the REM sleep of kids under age one, using low frequency wave pattern loops visuals, of Tatla are projected in their temporal lobes. Of the kids have seen the same robot in their dreams. But that s not all. Tatla is growing. The result of this excess self-propagation is... the creation of another world. A world different from ours, one of terrible nightmares. Their world is invading our world. Tatla. She was originally a mythicai goddess. A beautiful goddess repeating destruction and rebirth. I know all, see ail. This appetite for destruction and rebirth is hardwired... in Tatla s program. This being " destroy things, buy things, then destroy them" If so then, the world will advance infinitely. The Minerva religion EQUALS the shitty slogan of Catty&Co. I know all, see ail. Oh dear... The power's gone off. The stage has been set. Then they created an ill-natured femaie cat. You don't know huh? In 1869 of the CatEarth calendar on the Planet of Edessa in the Orion system 200,000 newborn kittens went missing in a big fire at night. It was never made public. We whispered the name of this dreadful night calling it... the Red Night of Edessa. 200,000 kittens were tested to overwrite Tatla s program. But only one female kitten was successful. Sent to the place they long to control during a time, of chaos and war. No, the opposite. They were fascinated with war and revolution. They're so damn annoying. That s right. They love blood. Blood flowing from others. Their true nature. Then, by Tamala being eaten, this female cat can propagate their appetite by being sent into this place of chaos. Along with Tatla, they created a pussy cat unconscious of destruction and rebirth. Why was she eaten you ask? Others religions practice this too right? But they were proper religions. ' A single grain of wheat can take root. ' A sacrifice. A scapegoat. Destruction and rebirth feeds on sacrifice of beauty. A sacrifice. A ritual becoming of these crazed believers. I have no idea what you're babbling about. Don't play dumb. That s why you're hurting young man. That's why I came without an invitation. Then maybe... just maybe I am you. I m a... Tamala was born in 1869. She's been alive for over 100 years. I m a cat who never dies too. Cat got your tongue? I know all, see ail. But that girl is unworthy. She never dies. She's one year old forever. She s the one true victim. She must be saved. She was born on Orion and soon ripped away from her mother. The Red Night of Edessa Midnight Aprii 29, 1869. By Minerva... Catty s dirty paw. I feel unworthy. She longs to meet her real mother. Besides, Orion is a nice place. The only place where a cat like me who never dies... can finally rest in peace. I know all, see all, hear all. Oh, no, no. There I go again. Just when i was talking about the enigma of Minerva, this enigma fabricates yet another answer. Why you ask? Because I intervened in that riddle wrapped in an enigma. ...Minerva could be a demon possessed in history!! How about another cup of milk? I'll pour you one. Then, we are hoping for demons within ourselves. He's whacko. Definitely not sane. Tune in next week for the final climax. Ah, it's over. Me can't go home yet. Wait just a moment longer. The mirror spins around again. The mirror... spins around... again. I'm so tired of these games. So tired of this job. This mirror projects nothing but lies. This mirror... projects... nothing but lies. Me go to Orion. Then, I'll smash the lying mirror. Orion... Edessa... Then, I'll keep on dancing. Fucking goodbye. I II wait just a moment longer. I II wait just a moment longer. You will perish. If you stick around, I'll kill you. Oh, I lost my head. What s your name? Penelope.

In regards to your request, your real mother is on Orion. But, Tamala, you can't leave the Cat Galaxy. Too bad. Where is she, you geek? Speak up boy! You're supposed to keep an eye on her. ...I want to set Tamala free. You don't have a contract with Tamala. I still have a contract with Catty. Piease hear me out. I'm not interested. It's a waste of time. Tamala is on her way to Orion. Stop delivering letters. Hurry up and follow her. Where can I find me a good man? Not again? Anyway, that pervert Kentauros died. Seems he was beaten up by kids. Frightening. But, every dog does have his day. He was up to all sorts of evil. Everyone hated him. Anyway, did you go to Victoria's Secret? They ve got some great lingerie in. Frilly ones, see-through ones. Oh, I got an email. Who now? The world has everything now. The past is like a lie. Why don't we go to the country and start a new business? Hello? Oh, how are you baby? I just saw a dead body in Burika. Yeah. Uh-huh. ...Like people say... Cats are Ionely. They easily drop dead like falling rain. But, we have each other. No strings attached. Like a constellation. Shining in the night. ...Amazingly mysterious. Got a light? Another fucking day has begun. Tamala, where are you going now? To Orion. To Orion. Not such a long time ago. A forgotten melody. Recall the moment of awakening of this fuckin' song while yawning. Slowly brush your teeth and put on the kettle. Gaze into the mirror. Slide a shirt on. Open the window. The first light of day. A glimmering bottle of jam. Faint sounds of traffic like the rumble of waves. 30 minutes later, a voice comes from the radio. Let's go on a picnic on a funny day. You can take a day if you like. Call up friends, "Don't be late" Get a lot of beer, chicken and snacks. Go to work, sell records, fall into a doze. That melody is ringing in my dreams. A girl with dark eyes plays the piano. I finally awake and head for the bathroom. Let's go on a picnic on a funny day. You can take a day if you like. Call up friends, "Don't be late" Get a lot of beer, chicken and snacks.
