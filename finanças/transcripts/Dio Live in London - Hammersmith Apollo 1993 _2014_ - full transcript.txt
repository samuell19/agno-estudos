Medley ?The Last in Line? ?Straight Through the Heart? ?Stand Up and Shout? It's the same old song You gotta be somewhere at sometime And they'll never let you fly It's like broken glass You get cut before you see it So open up your eyes You've got desire So let it out You've got the power Stand up and shout You got wings of steel but they never really move you You only seem to crawl You've been nailed to the wheel but never really turning You know you've got to work it out You've got desire So let it out You've got the power You are the strongest chain And you're not just some reflection So never hide again But you are the driver You own the road You are the fire Go on, explode You've got desire So let it out You've got the power ?Strange Highways? I, I, good for nothing going nowhere So they say Someone, give me blessings For they say that I have sinned That when I crawl inside myself and ride into the wind On strange highways Hey you I want your number Don't you even wonder We do things our way here Questions These are forbidden We got no answers Believe us anyway So here is my confession: It's the only broken rule Sometimes I crawl inside of me Where I can be the fool On strange highways You can see the other side and you shall cross over You can't leave the other side If you say I will I will Everytime I climb the mountain And it turned into a hill Well I promised me I'd disappear And now I know I will So someone give me blessings for the times they say I've sinned So I can crawl inside of me and ride into the wind On strange highways Questions They're forbidden 'Cause we've got no answers Don't you even wonder Hey you, what's your number? Alright, we have a lot of music to play tonight so we'll get right at it. A lot of things you'd like to hear from the past, we'd like to do these for you. From the Holy Diver LP, it's called ?Don't Talk to Strangers? Don't talk to strangers 'Cause they're only there to do you harm Don't write in starlight For the words may come out real Don't hide in doorways You may find the key that opens up your soul Don't go to heaven 'Cause it's really only hell Don't smell the flowers They have an evil drug and it'll make you lose your mind Don't dream of women 'Cause they'll only bring you down Hey you You know me You touch me I'm real And I'm forever The one that lets you look and see You can feel me 'Cause I'm danger I'm stranger And I, I'm darkness I'm anger I'm pain I, I'm master The evil song you sing inside your brain Drive you insane Don't talk, no Don't let them inside your mind, no Run away, run away, go Don't let them in your mind Protect your soul Don't dance in darkness You may stumble and you're sure to fall Don't you ever write in starlight No, every word you say may be real 'Cause they're only there to make you sad Don't dream of women 'Cause they'll only bring you Run, run, run, run away Don't you talk, no You guys are great! Thank you so much! We should like to do another track for you as we already have one anyway, from the newest album by us, from the Strange Highways album. This one, strange song, this, like the strange album, it's called ?Evilution? Voil?. Good night We're closing again Come back We're open tomorrow We've finished today I'm just staying away We know what's good for your brain It's plastic dreams and fast machines Pushing it to the limit Girls and boys who think the noise is music in the air Twisted felon, stay awhile Here's your invitation Dirty rags and body bags Hello We're open once more Come in You need no appointment We're thinking in time That you'll move down the line And represent the business in hell Well Tell her hope is gone but you carry on We can set the soul free All is lost, so what's it cost to listen anyway? The world upstairs where no-one cares is just about to crumble See it through We'll burn for you Evolution Company And I know your number, 12 Look around It's coming again Twelve And just twelve Smiles Evilution time It's here Sit Neon names play neon games Showing it to the public I hate you and you hate me And everybody smiles Money talks and no-one walks But everybody's crawling Golden rags and body bags All night It's me Good night I'm open again Come back Come in Good bye We're closed Say Evilution From the Strange Highways LP. We should like to do another of the same, not the same song, but from that same LP. From ?Strange Highways?, one super little title says it all, ?Pain? this one. Give me a choice between pleasure and pain I choose Another day without a heartbeat How does your heart beat if they've taken it away? For the first time just don't think about it Take the water and wash your face with pain You can take away the power Your finest hour - It's when you laugh in their faces For the first time just forget about it Take a hammer and pound yourself with pain The way I feel alone Bury my bones on the moon If they never should find me it would be too soon Give me a choice between power and pain I choose pain Bury my bones on the moon If they never should find me it would be too soon For the first time just don't think about it Take the water and wash your face with pain Just forget about the pain No, never think about the pain (I made you think about the pain) Now give up pain (Don't give up pain) You just got some pain Some pain You got pain ?The Mob Rules? Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall You've nothing to say They're breaking away If you listen to fools The Mob Rules Break the circle and stop the movement The wheel is thrown to the ground Just remember it might start rolling and get you right back around 'Cause it's over, it's done They say the end is begun You've nothing to say They're breaking away Break the spirit and stop the movement The wheel is thrown to the ground Got to remember it might start rolling and take you right back around We're all fools Tracy G! [Grijalva] (Dio 1993-99, Love/Hate) Of course, that one from the Sabs. Vinnie and I, for a long time in that band, and happily, we might add, eh, Vinnie? Alright, we had a good time with that one. We should like to do another one for you that kicks something else special off. This one you remember, it's called ?Children of the Sea? In the misty morning On the edge of time We've lost the rising sun A final sign As the misty morning rolls away to die Reaching for the stars we blind the sky We sailed across the air before we learned to fly We thought that it could never end We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run Now it seems our world has come undone They say that it's over And it just had to be Yes, they say that it's over We're lost children of the sea Look out The sky is falling down It's spinning round and round The sun is going black Never never never coming back ?Holy Diver? Holy Diver You've been down too long in the midnight sea What's becoming of me? Ride the tiger You can see his stripes but you know he's clean Don't you see what I mean? Gotta get away Got shiny diamonds Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue Something is coming for you Look out Race for the morning You can hide in the sun till you see the light We will pray it's all right Gotta get away Between the velvet lies There's a truth that's hard as steel I say the vision never dies Life's a never ending wheel You're the star of the masquerade No need to look so afraid Jump Jump the tiger You feel his heart but you know he's mean Some light can never be seen You've been down too long in the midnight sea What's becoming of me? Ride the tiger You see his stripes but you know he's clean Don't you see what I mean? Gotta get away Sole survivor You're the one who's clean There's a cat in the blue coming after you ?Heaven and Hell? It goes on and on There's big black shape looking up at me And he said, ?I know where you want to be.? He said, ?Come with me and I'll give you desire. First, you've got to burn in fire.? On and on. Round... Sing me a song You're a singer Do me a wrong You're a bringer of evil The Devil is never a maker And the less that you give, you're a taker And it's on and on It goes on and on Well it's on and on It's Heaven and Hell Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion For every moment of truth there's confusion in life Love can be seen as the answer But nobody bleeds for the dancer ?Man on the Silver Mountain? I'm a wheel, a wheel, I roll, I can feel And you can't stop me turning I'm the sun, the sun, I move, I can run You'll never stop me burning Get down with fire Lift my spirit higher Someone's screaming my name Come and make me holy again I'm the man on the silver mountain I'm the day, the day, I show you the way And look, I'm right beside you I'm the night, the light, the dark and the light And I got eyes that see inside you Get down with fire Lift my spirit higher Someone's screaming my name Come and make me holy again I'm your man I'm your man on the silver mountain And I can help you, you know I can I'm the light, I'm the dark and the light I'll give you my hand You understand Vinnie! Vinnie Appice. Jeff Pilson (Dio 1993-99 Dokken 1984-2001 Foreigner since 2004) ?Heaven and Hell? (continued) Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion For every moment of truth there's confusion in life Love can be seen as the answer But nobody bleeds for the dancer And it goes on and on I can tell I say it's hell And my heart burns bright We'd like to do a couple more reasons why we came to see you this year. And that's because of the album ?Strange Highways?. This is not the Dio that you remember, of course. You hear different things. We try to do some of the things that you do remember and that you like. But our reason is to take two steps into the future, not ten steps backward. We should like to do this one for you, from ?Strange Highways?, it's called ?Jesus Mary & the Holy Ghost? Prime-time nursery rhyme Did you see the Teacher? Sister black and white What's she gonna do? They say eye for eye tooth for tooth But don't hurt your brother Cross road overload I, I testify They just showed me Mary She was stoned, stoned, danger zone Nothing in her eyes And then there, there in the air nailed to the cross was Jesus Cross road overload Now I lay me down to sleep Pray my soul to keep away from holy spirit holy ghost hiding in the dark And it's a nightmare, electric chair You might not get to heaven Poor boy, shout for joy We get to watch him till he cries Prime-time nursery rhyme Love just needs religion Cross road overload I testify Jesus, Mary and the holy bloody ghost. One more from ?Strange Highways?, we should like to do this one for you, about the place that, unfortunately I guess, at the moment we live. This will tell you all about it just by the title, it's called ?Hollywood Black? Came to the Sunset scene to find out who's inside of me Some lies I've never seen This one lies on the silver screen in between Real and Dream like a scream Caught in the middle Same story but different eyes Here's where the hero He never, never dies Can't you tell that all the wishes you make, they fill up the well? I'm caught in the middle Right in the middle Too late too little Back to the street again Or was that yesterday another yesterday's gone? Back in the jungle Running with the animals Howling at the sign of the spotlight Those dreams are made of glass You throw just one stone and then there goes your last window Can't you tell that every wish that you made has filled up the well? Yesterday I've been left in Hollywood And I'm never coming back Lost in Hollywood And I just, I'll never tell It's Hollywood And only fools come back 'Cause Hollywood's black Hello, darling, you alright? It was great for us to be hear again tonight. Thank you so much! We shall be back. We'd like to do this one before we go, it's called ?The Last in Line? this one. We're a ship without a storm, the cold without the warm, light inside the darkness that it needs We're a laugh without a tear, the hope without the fear We are coming home We're off to the witch We may never never never come home But the magic that we feel, it's worth a lifetime We're all born upon the cross We're the throw before the toss You can release yourself The only way is down We don't come alone We are fire We are stone We're the hand that writes then quickly moves away We'll know for the first time If we're evil or divine We're the last in line Two eyes from the east It's the angel or the beast The answer lies between the good and the bad And we search for the truth We could die upon the tooth The thrill of just the chase, it's worth the pain We'll know for the first time If we're evil or divine We're off to the witch We may never get home We're all born upon the cross The throw before the toss You can release yourself The only way is down We'll know for the first time If we're evil or divine We're a ship without the storm Cold without the warm Laugh without a tear Hope without the fear See how we shine Shine on You're the last in You're the last in line Thank you, guys, thank you so much! We can go out happy now. We'll do this one for you then. I guess you remember this one, it's called ?Rainbow in the Dark? When there's lightning You know it always brings me down 'Cause it's free and I see that it's me who's lost and never found I cry out for magic Feel it dancing in the light It was cold Lost my hold to the shadows of the night No sign of the morning coming You've been left on your own Like a rainbow in the dark Do your demons, well, do they ever let you go? When you tried, do they hide deep inside? Is it someone that you know? We're just a picture We're an image caught in time We're a lie You and I We're words without a rhyme No sign of the morning coming You've been left on your own Like a rainbow in the dark When I see lightning You know it always brings me down 'Cause it's free and I see that it's me who's lost and never found I cry out for magic See it floating in the air It was fear And you'll hear it calling you beware No sign of the morning coming No sign of the day (Big sight to the day?) You've been left on your own No sign of the morning You're a rainbow in the dark See your own Your own rainbow Thank you again! This one's called ?We Rock? You watch their faces You see the traces of the things they want to be but only we can see They come for killing They leave and still it seems that the cloud they left behind just penetrates your mind Sail on Sing your song Carry on We pray to someone But when it's said and done, it's really all the same It's just a different name Too many voices, all give you choices If you listen they will say that we can find the way But we'll sail on Sing our song Carry on What do you do? You watch those faces You're gonna see the traces of the things they want to be only we and we can see They come for killing They leave and still it seems that the cloud they've left behind just penetrates your mind Sail on Sing your song Carry on How we rock! Might just see us rock You've got to ride out stand and shout carry on Sail on Sing your song Carry on You rock Goodbye! Proved really tight, this one! Go for it, my old son! ?Here's to You? Here's to me Masters of the universe The curse of destiny All for one And one for all You can pull the trigger as you're knocking down the wall If you pile the truth too high the lies will always bring it down You desperation angels Here's what we've found That the world spins round Come on, raise the dead Heads will roll Cancel the infection We can purify the soul Do the crime Then write the law There's no harm in a change where a change you never saw You resurrection angels See what we've found That the world fell down, so Here's to me Here's to me Here's to reason Raise the dead Here's to freedom Raise the dead What is the reason? Raise the dead Here's to you Gonna let it go Here's to freedom And you Thank you all! Thank you! Good night! Thank you! Good night! Subtitles MAX MASUTIN
