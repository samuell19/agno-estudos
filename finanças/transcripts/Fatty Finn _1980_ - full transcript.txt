(children playing) (children singing multiplication) (child laughing) - Oh bum, the last day of the first term brung a big change in my life, owing to the running of the grand final. (frog croaks) (children playing) Just this is one more race, Trumper. Put you at the start, got me life savings on you. - Look at your beautiful muscles. - It's certainly an important occasion. - Too right. Win this one and I got me heart's desire. - Blimey, look at Bruiser Murphy. - [Children] (chanting) Bruiser, Bruiser, Bruiser, Bruiser! - He looks eerily confident, he's got something up his sleeve. - Nah, just cracking hardy. He knows he'll lose. - Plan B all ready to go? - Yeah. - Contestants, frogs in the middle. (all speaking) - Get out the way, beat it, go on. - It's a cane toad. Listen Bruiser, that's no frog. It's a prehistoric monster. - He squashed Albert! - He's a genuine Australian frog. My uncle Benny brung him back from Queensland in a box. - I raised him from a tadpole. - His name's Frankenstein and he'll win easy. - I'm gonna appeal; appeal to the stewards. - So am I. - Appeal away. You're history, Finn. So is the Finn gang. From now on, the Bruiser Murphy gang's going to be kings of the neighbourhood. - He squashed Albert, I raised him from a pole. - Shut up, kid. (children arguing) - The stewards are being bribed, I reckon and like the the crooks they were, they ruled straight away that Bruiser Murphy's Queensland cane toad was a true and honourable frog. I was a desperate man. (children arguing) Plan B. - Roger. - You can't plan B Fat, that's cheating. - You gotta fight with fire with fire. But this time I was gonna fight with fire water. For I had carefully soaked a selection of juicy grasshoppers in sweet Sherry. No frog could resist such a banquet. Except Trumper, of course, who was a strict Presbyterian. - He's a frog! (children fighting) - Feathers out, hold them up, you know the rules. Feathers only, no pins or broken bottles, no treading on other contestants, no interference on the field, instant disqualification if you swap frogs in mid-swim. May God smile on this great occasion! (children cheering) - Go on Frankenstein, go on, go on Frankenstein! You can do it, come on, come on Frankenstein, come on! - Come on, you can do it, come on. - Come on Trumper, come on Trumper. Come on boy, I know you'll make it. Come on, come on Trumper, you can make it! Come on! (children cheering) - Come on Franky, you can beat Trumper. Come on. (children sheering) - There's Darcy, there's Darcy. I think he's gone to sleep. - He's drunk, I think. - Come on Franky, you can beat that Trumper thing. Come over here. (frog croaks) Frankenstein, speak to me, mate. Come on, what's wrong with ya? - Aw, he's drunk, I think. (frog burps) - Flamin' Finn. (children cheering) - And the winner is Trumper!

(bell chiming) (children shouting) - I walked out past the old school bell and into the main holidays with a merry heart. For in my sugar bag was enough to buy what I always wanted. What I always wanted was a crystal set, a modern miracle of wireless communication on which a bloke could listen to the great Don Bradman, our most famous batsman, flay the Poms in the test cricket in far away Great Britain, on the other side of the planet. There was not a moment to lose either because the first test started in only 13 days time and crystal sets were scarce as hen's teeth and times were hard. ♪ Our Don Bradman, now I ask you, is he any good? ♪ ♪ Our Don Bradman, as a batsman he is certainly "plum pud"♪ ♪ Tate and Larwood meet their fate ♪ ♪ For it's always "shut the gate" ♪ ♪ When the boy from Bowral hits four after four ♪ - [Radio Host 1] (indistinct) - [Radio Host 2] Don Bradman said today, Australia was behind him, couldn't wait for the start of the first cricket test against England in two weeks time. - [Finn] Gee, two weeks to go! - It's not enough. - What? - It's not enough. In fact, it's very, very little. Nine pence the lot. - Nine pence? - Times are hard. Eight pence. - No, didn't reckon you'd do a swap. I didn't reckon you'd go as low as that. - Look, Mr. Finn. I like you. - I don't like you very much. - I'll do you a favour. - Yeah? - I will keep it for you here in the window. Reserved for 13 days until the end of the school holidays and if by then you have earned enough money, you can pay me for it then. - But can't I have it if I give you a deposit? I've got this yo-yo. - No. - But I got to have it by Friday a week so I can hear the test. Sit up all night and listen to it. - So try harder. - 17 and six. That's more than my dad saves in a year. Where am I going to get 17 and six, Mister? - Use your enterprise. (bell chimes) - Pal, come on. At least I got you, Pal, my little mate. Enterprise (whispers indistinctly) - Hubert, eat your porridge. - Ugh. - Don't you ugh me, young man. You don't know how lucky you are getting porridge for breakfast in the first place. - That's right, son, don't irk your mum. She works very hard. - Yes, I do. - I know you do, Mum, and I love you for it but this porridge is rotten. - You see, dear? He loves you for it. I've got to agree. This is rotten. I think it's got weevils in it. - Oh John, I'm sorry. - That's all right, Em. You weren't to know. What would you like for Mother's Day? - Ooh, well. If it's not too expensive, I'd like a new mangle for the laundry. - Would you? - If it's not too expensive. You see, I'm just a little tired of wringing out the clothes by hand in the kitchen sink. - It's not too expensive, of course not. I'll raise the money, as a man. - What are you doing, dad? - Off you go, boy. Why don't you, why don't you feed the weevily porridge to Mrs. Hogan's chooks? - Oh, what a good idea! Mrs. Hogan's, chooks love weevils. They're rich in protein. - Maybe I'll take my money box with me. - Thank you. - What could have gotten into that boy? - Just growing pains, dear. His new teeth are coming through. I think he's saving up for something too. I wonder what it could be. - Mertle, we're very lucky to have a boy like Hubert. - Oh, I know. Oh John, I'm so happy, even in this neighbourhood, thirty shillings a week, I've still got you. - My dear, I know things were better once and they'll be better again, soon and you'll get your mangle for Mother's Day. I promise. - Oh John, I believe you. Thousands wouldn't but I do. - I twigged right then that if I did get the money for the crystal set before Mother's Day, I would be well and truly in the poo. 'Cause dad would sting me for a loan the way he did for mum's birthday last year when he was on the dole. So I had to get the money quick smart but how was I to do it? Come on Pal-Pal. (dog barks) Only one sure avenue seemed open to a joker of my quick brain and flying feet. To wit, a job of message runner for Tiger Murphy the bookie. There was one very big obstacle standing astride this aforesaid avenue. The obstacle's name was Bruiser Murphy. - What do you want, Finn? This is my alley. This is my whole block. - I came to see your dad. - My dad, who do you think you are? - Yeah, who do you think you are? - Look, Bruise, I'm sorry I poked you in the back. It was just an irresistible impulse and it won't happen again but Bruise, I'm in a bit of trouble and if I could just get a job working for your dad so's I can make a few bob. Look, Bruise, you can trust me. I'm a good bloke, really and I know you're a good bloke. We're all good blokes deep down. - You miserable little slug. You slime. You cockroach. You come down my alley, ask my dad for a job so you can buy a lousy crystal set? - How'd you know that? - It's like your hide, Finn. I'm going to teach you a lesson. One you'll never forget. - Oh no, oh no, no, no, no! Anything but that! (Finn screams) (children laugh) - Come on Finn. Have a go, boy. - Ow! Man that hurt. - Just once more. - I'm going to show that mongrel! So help me, I will. Show him good. - Bide your time, Fat. One day you'll be as big as him, then you'll show him. - I'll show him before that. It's a matter of honour! - You're at the top, Fat. You got the champion frog and the champion goat three seasons running. Show him again at the goat race next week. Show him good! - Goat race is easy. I wanna really show the mongrel. And please let me find a way I can fix Bruiser Murphy good and also get me crystal set before Don Bradman spifflicates the Poms at Old Trafford. In return, I promise to do all my homework next term. Oh and could I have a fine day tomorrow? For our last cricket match? Preferably with a light southerly wind so I can deceive Skeet with my off-spinner. That's all for tonight, I think Lord.

The police have to be called in to control the mounting excitement. What a cricketer this lad is and only 10 years of age! Surely the greatest test double century I've seen in donkey's years! There are people running all over the pitch. Only Fatty Bradman remains steadfast at his place. - Ow! - Mr. Finn! You are under arrest! - Oh come on, Claffey! I didn't mean to.

I can't afford a whole fruit cart. - No! You must face the music, Mr. Finn. - How much it cost you, Fat? - Everything I had. Cleaned me out.

Not my dolly, no. (children playing) - The most successful enterprise thus far was 'You Bet' at which any customer, if he was a mug would bet Skeet he couldn't do something better than him. Hang upside down the longest or spit the farthest or hold his breath the longest and make his face the reddest. Skeet was a dead set moral to win this from the mugs because he could hold his breath until he fainted. How are you going, Tilly? - I don't like work much, Fat. - Do I charge more if they open their mouth? - Cripes. Why they want to do that? - I don't know. There's some funny people about. - Do you want a kiss, Fat? - Ahhh. No, thanks Till. Got to save me 10% for me crystal set. I only got eight more days and I need every penny I can get. - But it's on the house. - No. It wouldn't be fair on the other customers. Got to set a good example now I'm a man of business. - [Children] (chanting) Stand up, stand up! - Morning Finn. - Morning Snootle. Can we help you at all? - I wanted to make perfectly sure that there is no legal limit to the number of kisses I am entitled to so long as I continue paying. - Well, no. So long as you pay up, I guess. - Right. Shall we begin? - Oh, God. - It was at that point I wondered whether even a crystal set was worth it. Watching Snootle pash away like a big girl, I resolved to biff him good and proper, the moment the opportunity afforded itself. Knock out a few of his fancy teeth and improve his looks. - Roll up, roll up. Goat races! Hubert Finn Enterprises, make your fortune now! Kissing stalls, lemonade stalls, roll up! - Listen. You stay out of here. This is my alley, see? - Yeah, this is his alley, see. - Uh-huh. - And you tell Finn, if he doesn't shut down his stalls and move on by sundown, he's for it, see? Really for it. - Uh-huh. - Terrible things are gonna happen to him. Do you get me? - Too right. - Ow! (girl screams) Come back here, ya little runt!

Not yet. - Why not? - As shown on the card, it is reserved for one Hubert Finn until May the 13th. - He'll never raise the dough. Not in a million years. I'll give you 35 bob. - You tempt me sorely. - 36. - Especially since I too, be still my heart, lost much monies thanks to Mud Gudgeon. - Two quid and call it quits. - No. No. Leave my shop, you tempter.

He's frog and everything he's got. Finn always wins. He cheats and he wins. - Wouldn't do to lose the goat race this year, son. Not three years in a row. You better win it this year. - How am I going to win the goat race without a goat? As I ain't got a goat no more? - Without a goat, I'm surprised you entered. - I gotta win the goat race, even without a goat. I'll never be able to show my face around here again. - Son. This is how you're going to win the goat race. You're a dead set moral. - Dad, he's beautiful. - I splurged 20 quid on him when Mud Gudgeon came in. Five generations of champion goat blood winner in this black bearded Satan. - Jeez, he's nice. - His name's Bucephalus after Alexander the Great's horse, Bucephalus. Together, they made a fortune. (bells chiming) (happy music) - Jeez, what a bonza pacer. Look at his fetlocks. - Gee, Fat's in big trouble with that goat. We'd better warn him. - Nah, why should we? He's not our friend anymore. - That's right, he's not. - He's a capitalist pig. - Yeah, that's right, he is. - I seen him this morning down by the linger longer. After a while, couldn't bear to look. - What was he doing? - Newspapers, newspapers, yesterday's newspapers. Going cheap. Penny, ha'penny each. - Good day, boy. - Yesterday's Sun. All the news you missed. - Off the foot path, kid. - All right, they're a penny each, you miserable mongrels. Two a penny - No, no. Out the way, go on. - Positively last offer. Catch up on your ancient history. - Boy, this paper's got fish on it. I demand my money back. - Fish on it? I should charge you extra. Fish is a penny extra. - You young scoundrel. - Go on, Hector. (goat bleats) (man screams) - Get away! Aww Gawrd (thunder rumbling) - Mine's winning, look at it go! (melancholy music) - Y es, Mr. Finn? - I got these bottles, Mr. Zilch. They're for sale. (glass clinking) - Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Would you like to buy a milkshake, Mr. Finn? - If I buy bottles from you, I think you have a moral obligation to at least buy a milkshake from me. All my other customers have some sense of honour. - Yeah, why not. Caramel malted. - Five pence, please. - Oh, keep the change. - Why thank you, Mr. Finn. You're a gentleman and a scholar. No matter they say. (whistles) (rings bell) - What is it, Hubert? - Any old bottles, Mrs. Hogan? Or any old chicken droppings? - Oh! Hubert! - Ugh! Aww Gorsh - What do you think you're doing, young man? Picking bottles in the street like some common boy from the slums. I never thought I'd live to see the day when a son of mine would sink so low. - There, there, Myrtle. Times is hard. Things are crook in Muscle Brooke. - Why aren't you at home, weeding the garden like your father's said. You will bring me grey hairs with sorrow to my grave. - Mum, I was only using me enterprise. - I'll give you enterprise, my fine young gentleman. (dog barks, goat bleats) - It's always darkest before the dawn, Pal. There's always a silver lining. That's what they reckon. Six days to go and one bob in the kitty. And the Murphy gang out after me with fire and sword. Cripes. Bloke would have to be an optimist. - Psst. Psst! Hey nipper, can you run a message for me? It's kind of urgent, matter of life and death. - I don't know. - There's four bob in it for you at the other end. Here's the address. Delivered personal. - No. Four bob at this end. Matter of life and death, delivered personal. - Oh, struth. That's all I got left in the whole world. - Matter of life and death for me, too. 'Cause me mum will kill me if I'm not at home and the garden's only half weeded. - Fair dinkum? - Crikey. Take it yourself, save your money. - No, I can't. Look, two bob now and two bob then, hey? - Stop thief. Halt, halt in the name of the king! (indistinct muttering and whistle blowing) - [Finn] Maggie McGrath, sealed with a loving kiss. You coulda knocked me down with a feather. Here was I, Hubert Finn off to see Maggie McGrath, the queen of organised crime in the inner city. I felt very queer, I wasn't scared mind but it was like I was off to see Ned Kelly himself. (knocking on door) - What's your problem, junior? - I've got this parcel for Maggie, delivered personal. - Right-o, he's clean. Take him to Maggie. - Okay. - Lucky I didn't have Trumper along. - Who's Trumper? - Me frog. You would've squashed him.

Would you care to step into by humble abode? (piano playing) (toy train whistle blowing) I'm bored, Finn, bored to sobs. I want to be out in the real world. Partaking of real life, Finny, will you teach me the noble art of fisticuffs for five shillings an hour? - I don't think I've ever enjoyed earning five bob more. Everything I've thunk up to do to Snootle ever since I seen him pashing away with Tilly, I was now getting paid five bob to do by Snootle himself. Life can be very rewarding sometimes. Snootle, wakey, wakeys. - Excellent, Finn! - Same again tomorrow, same fee, five shillings. - That's okay with me, nice place you got here, Snootle. Swap you anytime. - Really? How quaint, Finn if you do forgive me, I was wondering if you might also, for a similar fee... - Name it. Wrestle a crocodile, anything. - Take my revolting little sister to her dancing class tomorrow afternoon? I'm supposed to but I'd prefer to go to the World Weight Championship down at the stadium, down among the real people. - Dancing class? What, up on Snob Hill? - Yes. - Well, I was going to go to the fight myself but I suppose you can't have everything. - Too true. - It was good how things worked out for the best in the end and for the money I'd get from the dancing class, I could buy mum a big box of milk tray chocolates for Mother's Day. (dog barking) - What are you doing, you scally wag? - Pal, come back, it's a hanging offense please come back. - Come here, ya mongrel! (dog barking) - Hound of Satan, it's off to the dog pound with you. Oh please, your highness, I'll pay for the sausages. It's not a question of payment or of sausage. It's a question of the law. - That's right. It's a question of the law. - Oh, please. Awww - Don't worry son, you can keep the sausages. - Thanks, Isn't there any way out, Mr. Claffey? He's the only pal I got left, all of me mates is out on strike. - Well, you could make a contribution to the Police Widows Fund. - How much? - A quid. - I haven't got a quid, how about the sausages! - 15 bob, a lot of grieving widows. - All right. (Coins clink) - Nicely cost me a packet, little mongrel. I'll never get me crystal set now. - Hubert, where on earth have you been all this time, young man, out on the streets instead of weeding the garden? Your father and I have been worried sick! Haven't we, John, John? - Just right. - Aw mum, I can explain. - I am not interested in your explanations any more! Now you get upstairs this instant and without any supper young man and you can spend the whole day tomorrow weeding the garden and mowing the lawn and cleaning the guttering and washing the dishes and raking the leaves. Do you hear me? - Yes, mum. - Ah well, you can't win them all. Wish I could win a few, though. If it was raining gravy I'd be holding a fork. Cripes, I'm hungry. - Tastes of grit No criticism intended, my dear. - No. Of course not dear, I understand. - Tastes like a dog's chewed it. - I lost all the next day doing slave labour around the yard for mum, at the end of it all, I reckon she'd be hard put getting a box of milk tray chocolates out of me for Mother's Day, box of jaffers if she was lucky. I snuck off at a late hour to kick Snootle in the face for money and there it was, another five bob and once again, the crystal set seemed in me reach but I shuddered to think what I had to do next to get it. - One, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three. Feel the music. - My Sunday best wasn't good enough for the twerps up on Snob Hill and I put a few of them down on me list. - Don't you know how to comb your hair? - Listen I don't want any more of your lip. Count yourself lucky you ain't being trod on yet. - That's no way to speak to a lady. You're nothing but a low, common brute. - I'm better at tango than you are, that's for sure. - Why are you so melancholy, I always feel drawn to melancholy men. - What? Several reasons, one is, I should be at the Welter Weight fight, instead I'm here in this monkey suit, making movements no human being's ever intended to make. - I know what you mean. Dancing is so pointless, so why didn't you go to the Welter Weight fight? - 'Cause I gave me word. Finn's word is his bond and besides, I'm getting paid five bob. - Five bob? Is that all I'm worth? (Finn shushing) I though you were doing it because you liked me. I've never been so insulted in all my life. - Now look, don't get me wrong. - I say, is this chap giving you a spot of bother? Should I cut in? - Oh, rack off! - [Teacher] Turn, turn, turn. - Don't cry. - I've never been so humiliated. - I say, look here. (children fighting) - Get out, you hooligan! (girl crying) - It was the last five bob I'd get out of Snootle. So the crystal set was in jeopardy once more and I know I should've felt glum but I didn't because I'd just put a large fraction of the upper class in St. Vincent's Hospital and that felt good. At the end of the day, there was 10 bob in the kiddie, seven and six to go. There was still one hope for a killing. Maggie McGraw and her message. I would go there first thing in the morning. ♪ But she's a mean, mean woman ♪ ♪ She's as mean as can be ♪ - Well hello gentlemen, my doors are always open to you. - Your gun, Maggie. ♪ She's a mean, mean woman, she's as mean as can be ♪ - Well, we got you cold this time, Maggie. Running a sly grog shop, you'll be charged with serving liquor to a minor. - Who's a miner? - You're a minor. - I've never been down a mine in my life. - Cease and desist, Mr. Finn. - Ah, let him go, Claffey. He's only here to run a message for me. Here's 10 bob for you, kid. - Oh, Maggie. - All right, you riff raff. Come on. (arguing) ♪ I am a mean, mean woman ♪ ♪ I am as mean as can be ♪ ♪ I'm really terrible ♪ ♪ I am a mean, mean woman ♪ ♪ I am as mean as can be ♪ ♪ Take it away, boys ♪ - Son, they've been docking me 10 bob a week down at work because of lower company profits and I haven't had the heart to tell your mother and that new Malley's mangle means a lot to her and tomorrow's Mother's Day and if she doesn't get it this time our lives won't be worth living Hubert. She's a fine woman, your mother and I'd hate to disappoint her. Wouldn't we, son? - How much, dad? - A quid with what I've got saved. I'll make it up to you, just you see. There's a horse running on Wednesday at Randwick that's a dead set stone morril. You can trust your old dad. (melancholy music) - Oh John darling, oh you shouldn't have. Oh, it's just what I always wanted. - Yes my dear, I know. - Oh, how could you afford it on your wages, I'll never say anything against you again. My husband and provider and what did you get me, young man? - I'm sorry, I forgot. - Well, you can forget all about your Sunday dinner then, can't you? - Yes, mum. Gee, I felt like a swan down a sewer for a bit and being paid in Monopoly money. People were looking down on me. Was this miserable crystal set worth it? Would I sink even lower in social status? Four and a half days left 'till the first test starts in England and I'm back to scratch. I look like mad for the silver lining but maybe it took Sunday off. - Poor old Fat. Perhaps we have been a bit hard on him. - Yes, it's a terrible thing to see any fellow human being sink so low. - He needs us. And I guess we need him, too. (children laughing) - [Finn] Ya coulda knocked me down with a feather. There I was, the lowest of the low but still my mates took me back. They were true good Samaritans. Every man Jack of them. (children singing) - Want a ride, Tilly? - I wouldn't ride with you if you paid me. - Come on, have a ride. Give yourself a thrill. - No. - I got my eye on you, Tilly, I think you're real pretty. - Go away, you stink worse than Bucephalus. - Get in or do you want Finn to get the treatment? - You leave Hubert Finn alone. He's twice the man you'll ever be. - Hubert Finn, that little maggot. I'll leave him alone if you get in, won't I? - Hey, watch this, come on, Bucephalus. Bucephalus, Bucephalus, onto Canterbury Double. I read that in a book, you know. - Stop skitin', you can't read! - Hey! - Quit showin' off! Hey, slow down! (bells chiming) Car horn honking) (girl screams) (breaks screech) (loud crash) (bird shrieks) - All right, all a bit of a laugh, hey. - Now you've done it, ya big lair. Fat! - Hi, Till! Why you puffin'? - You're up against fed. Bruiser just got a ticket for speeding! - What? - A 10 shilling ticket. Claffey estimated his velocity at 40 miles an hour. It was on the corner of Lange and Wattle. - What were you doing that far south? - I was with Bruiser, he gave me a ride in his goat cart. - Oh, did he now? - Yeah. - I see, I see it all, blow me down. You're a fickle female, just like all the rest. - But he said if I didn't get in the cart... - I don't care what he said, Till. You're a turncoat, let's have a confer. - Gonna do something about Bruiser. Something drastic, not you, you're a turncoat. Probably spying for Bruiser, ain't ya? Yeah, tell him about everything on your next ride. - No, Fat. - Get out of it. Now how are we going to Murphy? (boys all speaking simultaneously) Gotta win that crystal set. (wood creaking) (yawning) Good morning. (birds chirping) - Cripes, what's in this, Headlights? - Three Cauliflowers from the garden next door, two of grandma's old petticoats, God rest her soul, eight month's worth of the daily skips from under the house and six Gideon Bibles. - Six Gideon Bibles? - Yes, I think the goats like the thin paper. - (whispering) Keep it down, fellas. Ugh, I think I stepped in a custard apple. - Gah, no custard apples in Wooloomooloo. - Dog's poo more like. - Okay, everybody ready to go? - Yeah. - Too right. - Aye. - Right-o. Seasy, it's up to you, you know I'd go myself but you're the littlest. - That's all right, Fat. - Let me give you me secret grip for luck.

One hand tied behind me back. - What? - You leave Hubert alone or you'll cop this, Bruiser Murphy. - Ah get out, it's none of your business. - It is so my business, I live next door. - Leave her alone or you'll get a snoot full of itching powder, Murphy! - Come on down, Finn. Come on down and fight fair, one hand tied right behind me back. - Not today, Bruise. I've got to get me beauty sleep. Make it tomorrow. - When tomorrow, Finn? - Tomorrow midday at the gym, lunchtime but do it right, bring along your seconds and choose your weapons and that. - Me weapons is these, bare knuckles and you better order an ambulance 'cause it won't be much of you left except the few blood stained rissoles spread over half a mile. - You want to bet? - Tomorrow at midday, Finn, to the death. - Till. - Yes, Fat. - Thanks Till, you didn't have to do that. - I'm not a turncoat, Fat. - Course you're not. Didn't mean that, I was just belly-aching about the world in general. - Why'd you say you'd fight him, Fat, he'll skin you alive. - I thought I might make a few bob bettin' by proxy. Bettin' Bruiser'd beat me, few more bob to bet on the goat race. - He'll skin you alive, Fat. - Yeah, I know, no way out though, Till. ♪ Behold the silver lining ♪ ♪ Where there are clouds and fields in the sky ♪ ♪ Remember somewhere the sun is shining ♪ ♪ And so the right thing ♪ - I wish you'd sing some other song. ♪ Makes it shine for you ♪ ♪ A heart full of joy and gladness ♪ There had to be a way out, which didn't make me look like a yellow belly in front of my circle of acquaintances but I was blowed if I could see what it might be. Until fate in the guise of Snootle reared it's ugly head. - Finn, Finn. - Hi there, Snootle. I'm sorry I put all that dance class in hospital but I was provoked! - Don't worry, Finn. How's this, hey, hey? (punching wall) - Five bob okay this lesson? - Only if you stay on your feet, is that agreed? - Right-o. No, no, no, blimey. - No I've been taking additional instruction from Jimmy Sharman. The master, how am I? - You ain't bad. You ain't bad at all. (ding) (multiple children speaking) - Place your bets here, ladies and gentlemen. You're just in time for the big fight. - Bruiser Murphy, five, four and Fatty Finn, three to one. (children cheering) - Hey Finn, hope you got an ambulance waiting. (children booing) - That's my boy! - I hope this'll work. - So do I. (children booing) (children cheering) - You're doing the wrong thing, Fat. He'll break your back, Bruiser said, do you want to throw in the towel? If you do, you'll be able to get on the goat race tomorrow. - Listen, frog face, I'll be at the goat race in good health tomorrow. (children cheering) - Ah, not in my pants, you drong-o! On me face! (children cheering) Oh, sorry Headlights. (bell dings) - You know all the rules, no thumbs up the nose, no biting off ears, if punched on the nose in normal cause of combat, no bleeding on your opponent's eyes and may God have mercy on Hubert Finn, all right, shake hands. Come in fighting. (children cheering) - I feel a little faint, I'm afraid I'll have to send in my second. - Hey? - He's not gonna fight and he's gonna send in a substitute. - He can't do that. - Oh yes he can, according to the rules of duelling, which I just happen to have on me. - Well Bruise, I'm afraid he's got you cold.

So don't you lose. (children cheering) - And what a glorious turnout for this great event. The annual old school boy goat race. Thousands of spectators, the grandstands chock-a-block with celebrities, I can see Mo McKaky talking to premiere Lang and Sir Isaac Isaac's the governor general and colourful King's Cross figure Maggie McGraw out on bail. - Good luck, Fatty! - Keep away from Bruiser, he's in a bad mood and I reckon he'll try anything. - John, I don't want to look, he's going to lose. I know. - There, there. We've all got to lose some time. - Yes but we seem to lose all the time. - [Children] (chanting) Bucephalus, Bucephalus! (trumpets sound) - Ready, set, you all know the rules!

(crowd cheering) - Oh, oh I do hope he wins! Although he really doesn't deserve it. - Why not, dear? - Oh, I was so upset that he didn't buy me a Mother's Day present. - Em, I have something to tell you. - Activate Plan C! - Activate Plan C! (woman screams) (crowd cheers) - Don't hit me, dad, we'll try and make a go of it in Queensland. - It's all right, son, don't worry. I knew I could depend on you. So I put all me money on Fatty Finn. We cleaned up, son, thanks to you being a born loser and there's your share. - [Announcer] The under 12 Goat Race Chalice to Hubert Finn. (applause and cheering) - Three cheers to Fatty! - [All] Hooray! - Hip, hip! - [All] Hooray! - Hip, hip! - [All] Hooray! (children all speaking simultaneously) - Congratulations, Fat. - Gee thanks, fellas. You been real good friends. (boys all speaking) You too, Till. - That's all right, Fat. - Look at Bruiser, you really beat him this time. - Well, I better shoot off. - Why? - To get me crystal set. A terrible presentment had slipped into me gullet and it wouldn't go away, I break into a trot but the faster I went, the crooker I felt. I suppose I could have took a taxi but being broke is habit forming. (upbeat music) - Another customer came in a matter of moments ago and made me an offer I couldn't refuse. I sold him the crystal set. (sad music) Business is business. - Yeah. Fat lot of good it did me using me enterprise. - Ya didn't win this time, Finn. No one who cheats Bruiser Murphy dies happy. - [Finn] Well, what's the use in moping? I had all my wins so I bought a bottle of KB for the old man. - Cheers, Hubert. - And a late Mother's Day present for mum. (gleeful music) ♪ Our Don Bradman, now I ask you, is he any good? ♪ And so I've got me crystal set. 'Cause dad hawked mum's mangle to the pawnbroker but dad's got a second job now driving Taxis to get the mangle back and I sat up all night listening to Don Bradman, he made 334 runs before Tea . A world record for all time. (burps) (children giggling) It felt pretty good the first few days back at school. I even got to like Bruiser a bit. I wondered what we'd all get up to in the August holiday. (upbeat music)
