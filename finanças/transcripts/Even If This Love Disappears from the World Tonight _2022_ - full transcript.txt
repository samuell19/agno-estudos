Is it June already? How about school? After being discharged, you're going to school as usual. But who knows about your memory impairment? It's just the teachers and Izumi. What? You have to be careful not to let other people know. Why? No matter what happens, you won't remember them. There might be someone who can take advantage of you. So you decided to only get to know people you can trust. Good morning. Did you sleep well? Ummm... Am I becoming a huge burden? Not a big burden, right honey? You did a great job.

She was always in the heart of the family. She was like the sun. Thank you for telling me your precious story. I think it's the first time. Talking to anyone like this. - What about you? - What? Do you have any siblings? I'm an only child. I am a very precious only daughter. Daddy might go crazy if I told him I got a boyfriend. You don't have to tell him. Saying "He's my boyfriend" and greeting him together... I wanted to try something like that. Let's not do that. It's not even a real love. It's a strange thing. What is? I've never told my story like this before. When I'm with you, my impatient mind disappears. The pain is gone. Did you sleep well? Who... are you? What? I'm sorry. - Where am I? - What's the matter? Excuse me Maori! Izumi (trustworthy best friend) Hello Sorry izumi I don't know what happened. What's the matter? When I wake up, I'm at a park. There was a boy I didn't know next to me.

You came too What will you do, the number tag count is already... Tooru? Sensei I'm sorry Why didn't you tell me? Sorry for not telling you, I missed the timing. The Author Nishikawa is your older sister? I was ignoring you and making a lot of noise. Seriously maniac, that's the worst Don't mind me because I agree to it. I was surprised, she's a great beauty. You don't have to praise her like that. Talk to your sister slowly - But the appointment time... - It's okay. I'll meet Maori and I'll be there first. But I haven't met 'Today's Maori' yet. Tooru, that means... Do you know? I know about memory impairment Just like I thought. It was on the picnic day in the park, Maori told you? That's right She didn't write in her diary that what she told me. Why? I begged her not to write it. I want to keep seeing her without change. In other words, today's Maori What I know about her memory disorders She doesn't know therefore keep it a secret from her. Okay That's huge! It's shining. Dad! What's that wide fish..? What is it? Must be a stingray Will I be able to start a family someday? even having a baby They say I won't recognize my child every morning. Even now, everyday things are overflowing in my diary.

I said something weak Maybe you won't get married, you don't think you can Let's have fun together then With me, who feels like a high school student all my life? Self diss! It's the first joke Nice job, funny I was surprised you had a signing event here. The publisher begged me eagerly, so I couldn't refuse. Aren't you a bit skinny, Tooru? Akutagawa-san is amazing. It's nothing suspicious, but it's a hasty thing. family... It's a choice I made at the cost of Tooru I am not sacrificed I lost my mother to heart disease All the housework was done by my sister. Those painful days For my sister, the world in the book was the only place she could lean on. Is that interesting? Even after her mother died, her father continued to write novels. But my father, who enjoyed writing, was no more. Since then my sister secretly wrote a novel while paying attention to my father Received the Rookie of the Year Award Award-winning work Nishikawa Fumino, 'Allium Flower at Sunset' A novel written by my sister before she knew it My heart was also a place to lean on I know Yes I'm really glad you're looking forward to it. 'Cause I can't hurt my family. I'm sorry, I'll hang up I learned to do housework The reason my sister was able to immerse herself in the novel I was proud It's not like a sacrifice That's why I cheered for you when you left home. How's father? Is he well? The same But are you going to keep it a secret from our father? I'll let you know when the results come out honestly so? How about you? Do you have a girl you like? What? I knew it when I saw you. She's more like a friend than a girlfriend. that girl Had an accident that caused memory impairment. Once she falls asleep, she forget all the memories of that day. So, she keeps a diary of what happened every day. If she doesn't read that diary again she would forget about me. but... When she opens her diary, you will always be there. That's right, so I filled her diary with fun things. I hope the girl who reads it can feel a little brighter every day. I'm glad you have someone important to you, Tooru. I'll go then. Thanks, see you again Tooru-kun! You have to be good to her too. Okay Don't worry. Over there How cute! As an apology for being late, I'll buy it for you. Really? then this Let's buy it as a couple. - As a couple? - You said you meant it as an apology? - Okay. - I did it! Hurry buy it Bye now See you tomorrow You seem to have changed, Kamiya. Really? You used to think being blunt like you didn't like Maori. Why are you laughing? It's creepy. Right now, I want to make every day with Maori fun. Even if Maori can't remember? Yeah, that's why I made up my mind I see. In front of the person in charge of the Literary Newcomer Award The Akutagawa-san announcement was tonight, right? Akutagawa Prize, Naoki Prize announced tonight That's right I see Let's all wait for the announcement Nice but where? the place is How about my house? What? I'm the closest. - How about it? - Are you okay with that? Okay It's decided, Tooru, let's go! Wait for a sec Isn't your father there? If you told him you had a boyfriend, would he go crazy? Did I?

I have to cook dinner. Are you running away? Weren't you prepared for something like this? I have memory problems due to an accident. I will read the diary on the desk. A Maori would see this every morning and be indescribably distressed. Still reading the diary and energizing herself. Even in the face of despair, she always smile she never runs away Didn't you make up your mind? You want to make Maori happy every day? Akutagawa Prize Fumino Nishikawa "Remnants" It's my honest feeling that I'm confused right now Tooru-kun Nishikawa Fumino is... Did you know? I knew What Was it like that? Sanae seems to have run away to become a novelist. My sister is different from me and my father What's different? My sister didn't run away. She went out to find her own life so.. That's why Sanae ignored me so much even as a father I failed as a novelist How much did I miss up What kind of novelist is my father? You've been running away ever since my mother died! Tooru, you bastard! I am now I don't want to run away. Tooru! Why I decided to write a novel It was my father's influence At first, I wrote it to escape from the real me. But since when did it change writing through the language I wrote could lead to someone I came to think My father He kept writing novels for my mother, right? Mother was reading father's novel with pleasure. She liked them. When that person passed away I should have been sad It was so sudden as a father the two of you I made it so hard really But I'm grateful to my father You raised us like this furthermore You stayed by my side even now father is a great father Come in It could be a meddling Your dad asked me how Musashino Art University Thank you but It's impossible to prepare for the entrance exam at an art college now. - Why are you like this? - You are so relaxed. you draw well I was in the art club when I was in middle school. I even received an award. Give it back I see Skills once learned are not easily lost. Memory Mechanism Unraveled! Why can't I forget how to ride a bike? is that so? They call that 'procedural memory' Remember the procedure? Statement memory: language, images, knowledge, memories Procedure memory: piano, bike, ski Like how to ride a bicycle, it's a memory memorized by the body sensibly So you're saying it's not forgotten? You said it's been a while, but you were able to ride a bike, right? Maybe it's the same with drawing? Your body remembers it, so if you keep drawing it will develop procedural memory So keep drawing a lot I'm not asking you to draw me You told me to draw, didn't you? I did but don't draw me. What do you think? Even if you don't remember yesterday, you said that the picture will get better Even in a country like this He told me something could go on I want to show the Tooru reflected in my eyes today to the me of tomorrow With that mindset, I continued to draw Tooru. Here that guy Gives me a ray of hope every day Tooru fell asleep because he was tired. My day starts out feeling hopeless Happiness fills me up as I spend time with him. memories that do not accumulate something that may remain me in the diary It looks like you really like him and I I'm going to meet him today Fireworks festival That hairpin! you find it soon suits you very well I'm overflowing with happiness again my memory won't catch up Even such a precious moment I forget Even this warmth I'll forget I don't want to forget I don't want to forget I won't forget no memory won't disappear completely don't go anywhere Tooru-kun I always I will be by your side I'm sorry. Tooru-kun I... the third condition Is it okay to break it? I am...

The two continued to be a couple. I looked at those two up close and left alone See you again bye! Did you wait long? Shall we go now? - You know. - Maori, let's go. - Thank you so much. - What? Without you I would never have gotten my diploma You tried really hard Great job Those words are just a reflection It's because you made me happy every day. Let's go play here and there together. You went to the aquarium, picnic, and fireworks festival. There was also a lunch box that Izumi made herself. Because it's full of memories I don't remember What are you going to wear to the thank-you party? The dress I bought the other day It suits you well See you again You look pretty too Okay See 'ya then let's meet again tomorrow Ok see you tomorrow Thank you What for? I mean Maori When I first heard it, I thought the two of you would break up soon. Maori's memory might get better That the feeling of liking you is not forever Because I saw my parents But when I see you two The feeling that you like each other can last a long time I came to believe a little bit I fell in love with you too. So what if I'm asking you to take good care of my friend in the future Because you are my precious friend too What's the matter? Say something Izumi I have a favor What is it all of a sudden? I mean My heart must be bad so I fell down yesterday I didn't have any problems because my mother had heart disease Just in case, I decided to get tested tomorrow. I see by the way It's not like it's going to get worse right away, right? But because my mother passed away I think it would be better to ask for it when you remember If if only I... if something happens to me Tooru Kamiya How many times have you called!? What about the examination? What were the results? Tooru is... My younger brother... died this morning He collapsed from an arrhythmia last night. He did not wake up. I feel like I will be swallowed whole by the trembling of my body I am I was defenseless against death after hesitating Tooru's death was reported to Maori The sadness I can't handle alone I passed it on Even though I knew it was an inseparable sadness so strange Even though I have no memory of that boy. I only saw his face in pictures. I only remember the contents of the diary. so strange it's not weird Anyone can see that the two of you were a good couple. not strange at all In the end, there couldn't be an all-night funeral. Maori's state of mind was completely broken. She couldn't handle everything I came to rely on Tooru's older sister I see Tooru asked for a favor. Thanks for talking Tooru in the past He once told me Maori's story He wanted to fill her diary with fun things She said happily through the diary He said he wished every day to be a little brighter So Tooru Could it be that she imagined what would happen after he disappeared? She open her diary every morning Maori's feelings to face the death of an unforgettable lover over and over again. if something happens to me I want you to erase my existence from the Maori's diary. What are you talking about? If I don't appear in the diary It can be something that doesn't exist in that girl. Are you seriously okay with that? We didn't know each other before the accident. Me and Maori Actually, we haven't even met yet. So please delete it Because you are a precious friend to me too If your heart is too hard, I'll take over the manipulation of the diary Do you think that method is good? Tooru left that judgment up to you So Izumi you have to decide If it's hard to decide, you can blame me Because I have a justification to follow my brother's wishes The decision that Tooru entrusted to me I imagined a future for Maori that might be broken Here it is When you wake up in the morning, be sure to read this diary It's okay I fell asleep I'll make a copy of the diary and return it right away.

That's right Do you know? What? Do you think you did well? It must have been a question I shouldn't have asked How were you? Until the day before the end of his life stayed by my side Where is this? Kugenuma Inari Shrine When I was young, I came with my family on New Year's Day Not wanting anything in return he just gave me memories - It came, it came - above Even so I just kept forgetting The time and memories I spent with him exist only in my diary. no memory won't disappear completely I have memory problems due to an accident. I will read the diary on the desk. Don't forget about Tooru Kamiya therefore God, I beg you Engrave on me the time I spent with him Don't forget about Tooru Kamiya My memory problem is better, so that's great Thank you But I I can't remember about Tooru While reading the diary, my heart is filled with happiness I don't remember Everyone will eventually forget Even in me, someday Tooru will become a part of the past But that's how everyone lives therefore You can't neglect your future Okay but even so If everyone forgets him I want to slowly turn back Something precious with him Because it will remain in me gotta try this delicious! Can you cook? What's with this rudeness? Izumi I have a story to tell What? you know I'm thinking of preparing for the entrance exam at an art college I thought it was that story It's disappointing, I thought you'd be surprised Did you say procedural memory? that's right Tooru is obviously Even to me who can't remember I think he wanted to let me know that there is something that accumulates. So I don't want to waste that heart It's so much like Tooru. Is that right? I see I'm full! It was unexpectedly delicious Unexpectedly? Did you sleep well? In this world that is only being forgotten There are things that remain unfaded Tooru definitely exists in me Even if this love disappears from the world Because my heart will draw you Your right hand is poking your cheek A lukewarm mug in my left hand Your right eyebrow is slightly lowered The morning has fallen like this One peony is all it takes I will impress you and give you happiness enough to forget your heart it'll be one The deep night I have to follow to the point where I don't even know what's left or right The silence of going alone if you can tell me one Your left eyebrow is slightly lowered I can't remember, I don't think I know In your right hand is a novel that you once bought well that's the left hand All you need is one sunlight at night The sadness that moved you and gave you a glimpse into your heart it'll be one I hope I can grope through the summer hail that your eyes don't close Peeling the mind from my body bit by bit I'll give it to you and give it all Rubies from the hilt, sapphires from these pupils A heart made of lead, just keep it by your side One peony is all it takes I will touch you and give you happiness enough to forget tears just a little bit The sun to stop today's drizzle All it takes is a little bit for your world, all it takes is a little bit for my shoeprint Do you know that your happiness is not one The deep night I have to follow to the point where I don't even know what's left or right In the long days ahead that you're going to go, I won't if you can tell me one No matter what I eat, I can't taste it, it feels like my body has disappeared I thought your heart and mine would forever be one
